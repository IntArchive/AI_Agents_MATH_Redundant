    "Content":"I am trying to prove the convergence of the $p$ -series $$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac1{n^p}.$$ for $p > 1$ . I am wondering if there is a proof that this series converges, either directly or by applying some test for convergence.",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"We can bound the partial sums by multiples of themselves: $$\\begin{eqnarray}\nS_{2k+1}\n&=&\n\\sum_{n=1}^{2k+1}\\frac{1}{n^p}\\\\\n&=&\n1+\\sum_{i=1}^k\\left(\\frac{1}{(2i)^p}+\\frac{1}{(2i+1)^p}\\right)\\\\\n&<&1+\\sum_{i=1}^k\\frac{2}{(2i)^p}\\\\\n&=&1+2^{1-p}S_k\\\\\n&<&1+2^{1-p}S_{2k+1}\\;.\n\\end{eqnarray}$$ Then solving for $S_{2k+1}$ yields $$S_{2k+1}<\\frac{1}{1-2^{1-p}}\\;,$$ and since the sequence of partial sums is monotonically increasing and bounded from above, it converges. Eight years after I posted this, Zach Teitler pointed out that this proof was already published in $1979$ by Teresa Cohen and William J. Knight in Convergence and Divergence of $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} 1\/n^p$ , Mathematics Magazine, $52(3)$ , $1979$ , p. $178$ ( accessible version , DOI link ).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me try to figure out how to format this problem according to the user's instructions. The original question is about proving the convergence of the p-series ∑1\/n^p for p > 1. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem mentions the series starts at n=1 and goes to infinity, and p is greater than 1. So the assumptions should list each condition separately. The user's example had each assumption on a new line, addressing one property per object.\n\nLooking at the example, they listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. Here, the series is from n=1 to infinity, but the key condition is that p > 1. The problem is to prove convergence under these conditions. \n\nWait, but the problem statement doesn't mention any other conditions except p > 1. The series is ∑1\/n^p, so the variable is n, and p is a parameter. So the main assumption is p > 1. The problem is to prove convergence for this series when p is greater than 1. \n\nI think the assumptions here are straightforward: p is a real number, p > 1. Each of these should be separate. But maybe the user wants each condition per line. So \"p is a real number\" and \"p > 1\" as two separate assumptions. The problem is to prove that the series converges under these conditions.\n\nI should check if there are other implicit assumptions. The series is from n=1 to infinity, which is standard for p-series, so maybe that's part of the problem statement but not an assumption. The user's example included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, but in the problem here, n is the summation index, so it's already an integer starting at 1. But the original problem didn't state that as an assumption, so maybe it's not necessary here. The key assumption is p > 1. \n\nSo the formatted problem should have assumptions: p is a real number, p > 1. Then the problem is to prove convergence of the series. \n\nWait, but in the example, they had the assumption that n is an integer even though in the original problem it's implied. So maybe here, even though p is a parameter, we need to list that p is a real number. So the assumptions are:\n\n- p is a real number\n- p > 1\n\nAnd the problem is to prove that the series ∑1\/n^p from n=1 to infinity converges. \n\nThat should be correct. Let me confirm with the example. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer and n divisible by 7. Here, the problem is for p > 1, so the key conditions are p being real and greater than 1. So yes, that's the way to go.",

Since $p > 0$, it follows that $(2i+1)^p > (2i)^p$. Taking the reciprocal of both sides reverses the inequality:\n    $$\\frac{1}{(2i+1)^p} < \\frac{1}{(2i)^p}$$\n    Therefore, for each term in the summation:\n    $$\\frac{1}{(2i)^p}+\\frac{1}{(2i+1)^p} < \\frac{1}{(2i)^p}+\\frac{1}{(2i)^p} = \\frac{2}{(2i)^p}$$\n    Applying this inequality to the sum from Step 1:\n    $$S_{2k+1} = 1 + \\sum_{i=1}^k\\left(\\frac{1}{(2i)^p}+\\frac{1}{(2i+1)^p}\\right) < 1 + \\sum_{i=1}^k\\frac{2}{(2i)^p}$$\n\n3.  **Simplify the right-hand side**:\n    The right-hand side can be simplified by factoring out constants:\n    $$1 + \\sum_{i=1}^k\\frac{2}{(2i)^p} = 1 + \\sum_{i=1}^k\\frac{2}{2^p i^p} = 1 + \\frac{2}{2^p}\\sum_{i=1}^k\\frac{1}{i^p} = 1 + 2^{1-p}\\sum_{i=1}^k\\frac{1}{i^p}$$\n    By definition, $S_k = \\sum_{i=1}^k\\frac{1}{i^p}$. So, we have shown:\n    $$S_{2k+1} < 1 + 2^{1-p}S_k$$\n\n4.  **Establish the second inequality**:\n    The sum $S_{2k+1}$ contains all the terms of $S_k$ plus additional positive terms:\n    $$S_{2k+1} = \\sum_{n=1}^{2k+1}\\frac{1}{n^p} = \\sum_{n=1}^k\\frac{1}{n^p} + \\sum_{n=k+1}^{2k+1}\\frac{1}{n^p} = S_k + \\sum_{n=k+1}^{2k+1}\\frac{1}{n^p}$$\n    Since $k \\ge 1$ and all terms are positive, $\\sum_{n=k+1}^{2k+1}\\frac{1}{n^p} > 0$. Thus, $S_k < S_{2k+1}$.\n    Since $p > 1$, we have $1-p < 0$, which means $2^{1-p}$ is a positive constant. We can multiply the inequality by this constant without changing its direction:\n    $$2^{1-p}S_k < 2^{1-p}S_{2k+1}$$\n    Adding 1 to both sides gives:\n    $$1 + 2^{1-p}S_k < 1 + 2^{1-p}S_{2k+1}$$\n\nCombining the results from steps 2, 3, and 4, we obtain the complete chain of inequalities:\n$$S_{2k+1} < 1 + 2^{1-p}S_k < 1 + 2^{1-p}S_{2k+1}$$\nThis completes the proof.\nfinal:\nProblem:\nLet $p > 1$ be a real number and for any integer $m \\ge 1$, let $S_m = \\sum_{n=1}^{m}\\frac{1}{n^p}$. Prove that for any integer $k \\ge 1$:\n$$S_{2k+1} = 1+\\sum_{i=1}^k\\left(\\frac{1}{(2i)^p}+\\frac{1}{(2i+1)^p}\\right) < 1+2^{1-p}S_k < 1+2^{1-p}S_{2k+1}$$\n\nProof:\nFirst, we rewrite the sum $S_{2k+1}$ by grouping terms:\n$$S_{2k+1} = \\sum_{n=1}^{2k+1}\\frac{1}{n^p} = 1 + \\sum_{i=1}^k\\left(\\frac{1}{(2i)^p}+\\frac{1}{(2i+1)^p}\\right)$$\nThis establishes the initial equality.\n\nNext, for any $i \\ge 1$, we know $2i+1 > 2i$. Since $p > 1$, the function $f(x)=x^p$ is strictly increasing for positive $x$, so $(2i+1)^p > (2i)^p$. Taking the reciprocal reverses the inequality: $\\frac{1}{(2i+1)^p} < \\frac{1}{(2i)^p}$.\nUsing this, we can bound the terms in the sum:\n$$\\frac{1}{(2i)^p}+\\frac{1}{(2i+1)^p} < \\frac{1}{(2i)^p}+\\frac{1}{(2i)^p} = \\frac{2}{(2i)^p}$$\nSumming from $i=1$ to $k$ and adding 1, we get:\n$$S_{2k+1} < 1 + \\sum_{i=1}^k\\frac{2}{(2i)^p} = 1 + 2\\sum_{i=1}^k\\frac{1}{2^p i^p} = 1 + 2^{1-p}\\sum_{i=1}^k\\frac{1}{i^p} = 1 + 2^{1-p}S_k$$\nThis establishes the first inequality: $S_{2k+1} < 1 + 2^{1-p}S_k$.\n\nFinally, we compare $S_k$ and $S_{2k+1}$.\n$$S_{2k+1} = \\sum_{n=1}^{2k+1}\\frac{1}{n^p} = \\sum_{n=1}^k\\frac{1}{n^p} + \\sum_{n=k+1}^{2k+1}\\frac{1}{n^p} = S_k + (\\text{sum of positive terms})$$\nTherefore, $S_k < S_{2k+1}$.\nSince $p > 1$, the factor $2^{1-p}$ is positive. Multiplying the inequality by this factor and adding 1 preserves the relation:\n$$1 + 2^{1-p}S_k < 1 + 2^{1-p}S_{2k+1}$$\nThis establishes the second inequality.\n\nCombining these results yields the desired chain:\n$$S_{2k+1} < 1 + 2^{1-p}S_k < 1 + 2^{1-p}S_{2k+1}$$",
