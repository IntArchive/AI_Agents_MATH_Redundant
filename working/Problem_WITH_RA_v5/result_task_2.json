    "AcceptedAnswer":"These answers require way too much machinery. By definition, the characteristic polynomial of an $n\\times n$ matrix $A$ is given by \n$$p(t) = \\det(A-tI) = (-1)^n \\big(t^n - (\\text{tr} A) \\,t^{n-1} + \\dots + (-1)^n \\det A\\big)\\,.$$\nOn the other hand, $p(t) = (-1)^n(t-\\lambda_1)\\dots (t-\\lambda_n)$, where the $\\lambda_j$ are the eigenvalues of $A$. So, comparing coefficients,  we have $\\text{tr}A = \\lambda_1 + \\dots + \\lambda_n$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows how assumptions and the problem should be separated. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original problem carefully. The question is about proving that the trace of a matrix is the sum of its eigenvalues. The user mentioned that existing proofs are too obscure, so they want a simple one.\n\nNow, according to the format, I need to list all assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object. Then state the problem clearly.\n\nLooking at the original question, the key elements are:\n- The matrix in question (but the problem is general, not a specific matrix).\n- The trace of a matrix.\n- The eigenvalues of that matrix.\n\nBut wait, the original problem as stated doesn't mention any specific conditions on the matrix. However, in linear algebra, the trace being the sum of eigenvalues typically applies to square matrices, and depending on the field, perhaps complex matrices to ensure all eigenvalues exist. But sometimes it's stated for matrices over an algebraically closed field, or assuming that the characteristic polynomial splits into linear factors.\n\nSo the assumptions would include that the matrix is square, and maybe that it's over a field where eigenvalues exist (like complex numbers). But the original problem doesn't specify these; maybe the user assumes the reader knows that. However, in the example given earlier, assumptions were made explicit even if they weren't in the original problem. For instance, in the example, the assumption that n is divisible by 7 was added, which wasn't in the original problem's statement. Wait, no, looking back, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, the expression is divisible by 91. The formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, no, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the example formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, but that contradicts the original problem's statement. Hmm, perhaps the example was a mistake? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which would restrict n. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example is a different problem? Let me check again.\n\nWait, the example's original problem is: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that would mean the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 under the assumption that n is divisible by 7, which changes the original problem. That seems like an error in the example. But maybe the example is correct because the user's instruction says \"filtered the unrelated informations\". Wait, perhaps the original problem had some extra conditions, but the user restructured it to clarify the assumptions. Maybe the original problem had a condition that n is divisible by 7, but the way it was written was unclear, and the example extracted that. Hmm, perhaps I need to proceed carefully.\n\nIn any case, for the current problem, the original question is to prove that the trace of a matrix is the sum of its eigenvalues. The standard proof of this involves the fact that the trace is the sum of the diagonal entries and that the sum of eigenvalues is the trace, which comes from the characteristic polynomial. However, this requires that the matrix is square and that the eigenvalues exist (which in complex matrices they do). So the assumptions would be:\n\n1. The matrix is a square matrix.\n2. The matrix is defined over a field where its characteristic polynomial splits into linear factors (e.g., the field is algebraically closed, like the complex numbers).\n\nBut the original problem doesn't specify these; it's possible that the user assumes the matrix is square and over the complex numbers. Therefore, the assumptions should list these conditions.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the assumption added a condition (n divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem. That suggests that maybe in this case, the problem's original statement might have had missing assumptions that the answerer needs to clarify. However, in the given problem here, the user's question is very general, just asking for a proof that trace equals sum of eigenvalues. So perhaps the answerer needs to list the necessary assumptions for that to hold.\n\nTherefore, structuring the problem:\n\nAssumption:\nThe matrix is a square matrix,\nThe matrix is defined over an algebraically closed field.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the trace of a matrix is the sum of its eigenvalues.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the matrix is diagonalizable? But no, the trace-sum of eigenvalues holds even if the matrix isn't diagonalizable, as long as eigenvalues exist (with algebraic multiplicities). So the key assumptions are that it's a square matrix over a field where the characteristic polynomial splits (like complex numbers).\n\nHence, the formatted problem would have those two assumptions.",

By the fundamental theorem of algebra, every non-constant polynomial with complex coefficients has at least one complex root. However, the characteristic polynomial given in Assumption 3 is defined for any field.\\n\\nActually, let me reconsider: The characteristic polynomial formula in Assumption 3 is valid for any field. The algebraically closed field property is needed to ensure that the characteristic polynomial splits into linear factors, which allows us to identify the eigenvalues as the roots. But the trace-eigenvalue relationship can be deduced directly from the characteristic polynomial coefficients without requiring the field to be algebraically closed.\\n\\nWait, let me think more carefully: The proof that trace equals sum of eigenvalues relies on the fact that the characteristic polynomial can be written as $(-1)^n(t-\\\\lambda_1)\\\\cdots(t-\\\\lambda_n)$ where $\\\\lambda_i$ are the eigenvalues. This requires the field to be algebraically closed so that all eigenvalues exist.\\n\\nHowever, the characteristic polynomial formula in Assumption 3 already gives us the relationship: the coefficient of $t^{n-1}$ is $-\\\\text{tr} A$. If we define the eigenvalues as the roots of the characteristic polynomial (which may not all exist in the base field), then by Vieta's formulas applied to the polynomial $(-1)^n p(t)$, the sum of the roots is $\\\\text{tr} A$.\\n\\nTherefore, the algebraically closed field assumption is indeed redundant for proving that the trace equals the sum of eigenvalues, because the characteristic polynomial formula (Assumption 3) already encodes this relationship through its coefficients.\"\n}\n```",

    "final reviewer":"Proof: True\nproof:\nThe provided argument correctly demonstrates that the assumption of the matrix being defined over an algebraically closed field is not strictly necessary to establish the relationship between the trace and the sum of eigenvalues. The core of the proof relies on comparing the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial.\n\nLet A be an n x n matrix over a field F.\n\n1.  **Characteristic Polynomial Definition:** The characteristic polynomial is `p(t) = det(A - tI)`. Assumption 3 gives its expanded form in terms of the trace and determinant:\n    $$p(t) = (-1)^n \\big(t^n - (\\text{tr} A) \\,t^{n-1} + \\dots + (-1)^n \\det A\\big)$$\n\n2.  **Eigenvalues as Roots:** The eigenvalues `λ_1, ..., λ_n` are defined as the roots of the characteristic polynomial `p(t)`. These roots are guaranteed to exist in the algebraic closure of the field F, even if they do not all exist in F itself.\n\n3.  **Factored Form of the Polynomial:** In the extension field where the roots exist, the polynomial can be written in its factored form:\n    $$p(t) = c \\cdot (t - \\lambda_1)(t - \\lambda_2)\\cdots(t - \\lambda_n)$$\n    By comparing the leading terms of both forms of `p(t)`, the constant `c` must be `(-1)^n`.\n    $$p(t) = (-1)^n (t - \\lambda_1)(t - \\lambda_2)\\cdots(t - \\lambda_n)$$\n\n4.  **Comparing Coefficients (Vieta's Formulas):** Expanding the factored form, we get:\n    $$p(t) = (-1)^n \\big(t^n - (\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 + \\dots + \\lambda_n)t^{n-1} + \\dots\\big)$$\n    By equating the coefficient of the `t^(n-1)` term from this expansion with the one from Assumption 3, we find:\n    $$(-1)^n \\big(-(\\text{tr} A)\\big) = (-1)^n \\big(-(\\lambda_1 + \\dots + \\lambda_n)\\big)$$\n    $$\\text{tr} A = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i$$\n\nThis result holds regardless of whether the field F is algebraically closed. The relationship is inherent to the algebraic definition of the characteristic polynomial and its roots. The assumption of an algebraically closed field merely ensures that the eigenvalues `λ_i` are elements of the base field F, simplifying the context but not changing the fundamental algebraic truth.\n\n**Problem Statement without Redundant Assumption:**\n\nAssumptions:\n1.
