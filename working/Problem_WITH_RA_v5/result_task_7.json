    "Content":"I am trying to prove the convergence of the $p$ -series $$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac1{n^p}.$$ for $p > 1$ . I am wondering if there is a proof that this series converges, either directly or by applying some test for convergence.",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"We can bound the partial sums by multiples of themselves: $$\\begin{eqnarray}\nS_{2k+1}\n&=&\n\\sum_{n=1}^{2k+1}\\frac{1}{n^p}\\\\\n&=&\n1+\\sum_{i=1}^k\\left(\\frac{1}{(2i)^p}+\\frac{1}{(2i+1)^p}\\right)\\\\\n&<&1+\\sum_{i=1}^k\\frac{2}{(2i)^p}\\\\\n&=&1+2^{1-p}S_k\\\\\n&<&1+2^{1-p}S_{2k+1}\\;.\n\\end{eqnarray}$$ Then solving for $S_{2k+1}$ yields $$S_{2k+1}<\\frac{1}{1-2^{1-p}}\\;,$$ and since the sequence of partial sums is monotonically increasing and bounded from above, it converges. Eight years after I posted this, Zach Teitler pointed out that this proof was already published in $1979$ by Teresa Cohen and William J. Knight in Convergence and Divergence of $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} 1\/n^p$ , Mathematics Magazine, $52(3)$ , $1979$ , p. $178$ ( accessible version , DOI link ).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me try to figure out how to format this problem according to the user's instructions. The original question is about proving the convergence of the p-series ∑1\/n^p for p > 1. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem mentions the series starts at n=1 and goes to infinity, and p is greater than 1. So the assumptions should list each condition separately. The user's example had each assumption on a new line, addressing one property per object.\n\nLooking at the example, they listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. Here, the series is from n=1 to infinity, but the key condition is that p > 1. The problem is to prove convergence under these conditions. \n\nWait, but the problem statement doesn't mention any other conditions except p > 1. The series is ∑1\/n^p, so the variable is n, and p is a parameter. So the main assumption is p > 1. The problem is to prove convergence for this series when p is greater than 1. \n\nI think the assumptions here are straightforward: p is a real number, p > 1. Each of these should be separate. But maybe the user wants each condition per line. So \"p is a real number\" and \"p > 1\" as two separate assumptions. The problem is to prove that the series converges under these conditions.\n\nI should check if there are other implicit assumptions. The series is from n=1 to infinity, which is standard for p-series, so maybe that's part of the problem statement but not an assumption. The user's example included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, but in the problem here, n is the summation index, so it's already an integer starting at 1. But the original problem didn't state that as an assumption, so maybe it's not necessary here. The key assumption is p > 1. \n\nSo the formatted problem should have assumptions: p is a real number, p > 1. Then the problem is to prove convergence of the series. \n\nWait, but in the example, they had the assumption that n is an integer even though in the original problem it's implied. So maybe here, even though p is a parameter, we need to list that p is a real number. So the assumptions are:\n\n- p is a real number\n- p > 1\n\nAnd the problem is to prove that the series ∑1\/n^p from n=1 to infinity converges. \n\nThat should be correct. Let me confirm with the example. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer and n divisible by 7. Here, the problem is for p > 1, so the key conditions are p being real and greater than 1. So yes, that's the way to go.",

    "final reviewer":"Proof: True\nproof:\nProblem:\nProve that the series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^p}$ converges for $p > 1$.\n\nProof:\nLet $S_k = \\sum_{n=1}^{k}\\frac{1}{n^p}$ be the k-th partial sum of the series. Since $p > 1$ and $n \\ge 1$, all terms $\\frac{1}{n^p}$ are positive, which means the sequence of partial sums $\\{S_k\\}$ is strictly increasing.\n\nWe consider the subsequence of partial sums with an odd number of terms, $S_{2k+1}$. We can group the terms as follows:\n$$S_{2k+1} = 1+\\sum_{i=1}^k\\left(\\frac{1}{(2i)^p}+\\frac{1}{(2i+1)^p}\\right)$$\nSince $p > 1$, for any $i \\ge 1$, we have $2i < 2i+1$, which implies $(2i)^p < (2i+1)^p$. Taking the reciprocal reverses the inequality: $\\frac{1}{(2i+1)^p} < \\frac{1}{(2i)^p}$.\nUsing this fact, we can establish an upper bound:\n$$\\frac{1}{(2i)^p}+\\frac{1}{(2i+1)^p} < \\frac{1}{(2i)^p}+\\frac{1}{(2i)^p} = \\frac{2}{(2i)^p}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $S_{2k+1}$:\n$$S_{2k+1} < 1+\\sum_{i=1}^k\\frac{2}{(2i)^p} = 1+\\frac{2}{2^p}\\sum_{i=1}^k\\frac{1}{i^p} = 1+2^{1-p}S_k$$\nBecause the sequence of partial sums $\\{S_k\\}$ is increasing, we know that $S_k < S_{2k+1}$. Since $p>1$, $2^{1-p}$ is a positive constant, so we can write:\n$$S_{2k+1} < 1+2^{1-p}S_k < 1+2^{1-p}S_{2k+1}$$\nFrom this, we have the inequality:\n$$S_{2k+1} < 1 + 2^{1-p}S_{2k+1}$$\nRearranging the terms to solve for $S_{2k+1}$:\n$$S_{2k+1} - 2^{1-p}S_{2k+1} < 1$$\n$$S_{2k+1}(1 - 2^{1-p}) < 1$$\nFor $p > 1$, we have $1-p < 0$, which implies $0 < 2^{1-p} < 1$. Therefore, the factor $(1 - 2^{1-p})$ is a positive constant. We can divide by it without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$S_{2k+1} < \\frac{1}{1 - 2^{1-p}}$$\nThis shows that the subsequence $\\{S_{2k+1}\\}$ is bounded above by a constant value. Since the full sequence of partial sums $\\{S_n\\}$ is monotonically increasing and has a bounded subsequence, the entire sequence $\\{S_n\\}$ must be bounded above.\n\nBy the Monotone Convergence Theorem, an increasing sequence that is bounded above must converge. Thus, the sequence of partial sums $\\{S_n\\}$ converges.\nTherefore, the series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^p}$ converges for $p > 1$.\nfinal: The series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^p}$ converges for $p > 1$.",
