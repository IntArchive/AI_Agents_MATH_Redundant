    "Content":"In the past, I've come across statements  along the lines of \"function $f(x)$ has no closed form integral\", which I assume means that there is no combination of the operations: addition\/subtraction multiplication\/division raising to powers and roots trigonometric functions exponential functions logarithmic functions which when differentiated gives the function $f(x)$ . I've heard this said about the function $f(x) = x^x$ , for example. What sort of techniques are used to prove statements like this? What is this branch of mathematics called? Merged with \" How to prove that some functions don't have a primitive \" by Ismael : Sometimes we are told that some functions like $\\dfrac{\\sin(x)}{x}$ don't have an indefinite integral, or that it can't be expressed in term of other simple functions. I wonder how we can prove that kind of assertion?",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"It is a theorem of Liouville, reproven later with purely algebraic methods, that for rational functions $f$ and $g$ , $g$ non-constant, the antiderivative of $$f(x)\\exp(g(x)) \\, \\mathrm dx$$ can be expressed in terms of elementary functions if and only if there exists some rational function $h$ such that it is a solution of $$f = h' + hg'$$ $e^{x^2}$ is another classic example of such a function with no elementary antiderivative. I don't know how much math you've had, but some of this paper might be comprehensible in its broad strokes: https:\/\/ksda.ccny.cuny.edu\/PostedPapers\/liouv06.pdf Liouville's original paper: Liouville, J. \" Suite du Mémoire sur la classification des Transcendantes, et sur l'impossibilité d'exprimer les racines de certaines équations en fonction finie explicite des coefficients .\" J. Math. Pure Appl. 3, 523-546, 1838. Michael Spivak's book on Calculus also has a section with a discussion of this.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, so the user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me start by understanding the original problem.\n\nThe question is about proving that certain functions, like x^x or sin(x)\/x, don't have a closed-form integral. The user is asking what techniques are used to prove such statements and what branch of mathematics this is part of. There's also a mention of merging with another question about proving that some functions don't have a primitive (antiderivative).\n\nFirst, I need to filter out the unrelated information. The original question includes examples (x^x, sin(x)\/x), mentions of operations (addition, subtraction, etc.), and references to other questions. The core problem is about techniques to prove that a function has no closed-form integral and identifying the branch of mathematics.\n\nNow, structuring according to the format. The assumption section should list each condition or property applied to one object. However, in this case, the problem is more general. The function f(x) is given, but the specific functions like x^x or sin(x)\/x are examples. The key assumptions here would relate to the function in question having no closed-form integral. But the problem is more about the method rather than a specific function's properties.\n\nWait, the example given in the user's instruction was about an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But here, the problem is more about a general proof technique. Since the original problem isn't about a specific function but a general question, maybe there are no specific assumptions about the function's properties. Instead, the problem is to understand the techniques used to show that certain functions lack closed-form integrals. However, the user might have intended to include the examples as part of the problem statement.\n\nLooking back at the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted version listed assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Wait, the original problem stated \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted assumption, they included \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like an error, but maybe the example was a misrepresentation. Wait, maybe the original problem had a different condition. Let me check again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption says \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems conflicting. Maybe the example was incorrect. But the user's instruction was to follow the format regardless.\n\nSo, applying the same approach here. The problem is about proving that a function (like f(x)=x^x or sin(x)\/x) has no closed-form integral. The assumptions would need to be about the function's properties. However, since the question is general, perhaps the assumptions are about the function being considered, like f(x) is elementary, or that we're considering integrals in terms of elementary functions. Alternatively, maybe the function f(x) is specified, but in the original problem, multiple examples are given. Wait, the problem is asking about techniques for any such function, but the example provided in the question includes specific functions.\n\nHmm. The user wants the assumptions to list each condition applied to one object. In this case, the problem is more of a general question rather than a specific one. But the example given by the user included specific assumptions even when the original problem was general. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted version added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Maybe the user made a mistake in their example. But regardless, I need to follow the format as per their instruction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example was intended to show that sometimes the original problem may have hidden assumptions, and the formatted version lists them. But in this case, the problem is a general question. Maybe there are no specific assumptions here, but the user's format requires assumptions. Let me re-examine the original problem.\n\nOriginal question: How can you prove that a function has no closed form integral? They mention functions like x^x and sin(x)\/x. They ask about techniques and the branch of mathematics.\n\nThe formatted problem should have an assumption section. But since the problem is general, perhaps the assumptions are about the function being elementary or the integral being considered in terms of elementary functions. So, possible assumptions could be:\n\n- f(x) is an elementary function.\n- The integral is considered in terms of elementary functions.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that f(x) has no closed-form integral, which implies that even though f(x) is elementary, its integral isn't. So maybe the assumption is that f(x) is an elementary function, and the problem is to show its integral isn't elementary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem statement should include the example functions. But the user's example included specific assumptions even when the original problem was general. Wait, the user's example had a problem that was originally about all integers n, but the formatted version added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like an error. Perhaps the user intended to modify the problem, but in this case, I need to stick to the original problem's content.\n\nWait, the original example's formatted problem changed the problem statement from \"for every integer n\" to adding \"n is divisible by 7\". That might be incorrect. Maybe the user made a mistake in their example. However, the task is to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the format, which includes listing assumptions. For the current problem, since the question is general, perhaps the assumptions are that f(x) is a specific function (like x^x or sin(x)\/x) and that we're considering closed-form integrals in terms of elementary functions.\n\nBut the original problem isn't about proving for a specific function, but rather asking about the general methods. However, the problem statement in the formatted version should be the actual question. Let me parse the original question again.\n\nThe original question is: \"How can you prove that a function has no closed form integral?\" and merged with \"How to prove that some functions don't have a primitive\". The user is asking about techniques and the branch of mathematics involved.\n\nTherefore, the problem is to explain the techniques used to prove that a given function has no closed-form integral (i.e., no elementary antiderivative). The assumptions here would be about the function in question, but since the problem is general, perhaps the assumptions are that we are considering elementary functions and their integrals in terms of elementary functions.\n\nBut according to the format, the assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. Since the problem is general, maybe the assumptions are implicit in the problem statement. However, the example given by the user had specific assumptions even when the original problem was general, perhaps mistakenly. Alternatively, maybe the example was a different problem.\n\nIn any case, following the instructions, I need to structure the problem into Assumption and Problem sections. The original question is about proving a function has no closed-form integral, with examples given. The problem is about the methods to do this. However, the format requires listing assumptions. Since the problem is general, perhaps the assumptions are that f(x) is an elementary function and that a closed-form integral is defined in terms of elementary functions.\n\nTherefore, I can structure it as:\n\nAssumption:\n- The function $f(x)$ is elementary.\n- A closed-form integral is expressed using elementary functions.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the function $f(x)$ has no closed-form integral.\n\nBut the original problem is asking about techniques to do this, not to prove it for a specific function. However, the user's example took a problem and rephrased it with assumptions. In the example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the assumptions included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem said \"for every integer n\", so the assumption in the example seems incorrect. This suggests that perhaps the user's example may have been flawed, but I need to follow their format.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example was a mistake, and the actual task is to extract assumptions from the problem statement. In the current problem, the question is general, but maybe the assumptions are about the existence of a closed-form integral being defined in terms of certain operations. For example:\n\nAssumption:\n- A closed-form integral is expressed using addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, powers, roots, trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions.\n\nProblem:\nDetermine the techniques used to prove that a given function $f(x)$ has no closed-form integral.\n\nBut the original problem is asking \"how can you prove...\" and \"what sort of techniques...\", so the problem is more about explaining methods rather than proving a specific function. However, the user's format seems to require a problem statement that is a mathematical assertion to prove, like \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\".\n\nIn this case, perhaps the problem statement should be rephrased to match the format, even if the original question is more about methods. Alternatively, the user may expect the problem to be stated as \"Prove that a function f(x) has no closed-form integral\", but that's too vague. The examples given in the question are specific functions like x^x and sin(x)\/x.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formatted problem should focus on one of the example functions. For instance, if the problem is about x^x, then:\n\nAssumption:\n- $f(x) = x^x$ is an elementary function.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $f(x) = x^x$ has no closed-form integral.\n\nBut the original question is broader, asking about techniques in general. However, the user's example took a specific problem and listed assumptions, even if the original problem was general. This is a bit confusing. Since the user provided an example where the original problem was general (\"for every integer n\") but the formatted version added an assumption (n divisible by 7), which seems incorrect, maybe there's a misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended for the assumptions to list the conditions mentioned in the problem. In the current case, the problem mentions functions like x^x and sin(x)\/x, which are elementary functions. The closed-form integral refers to being expressible in terms of elementary functions. So the assumptions could be:\n\nAssumption:\n- $f(x)$ is an elementary function.\n- The integral of $f(x)$ is considered closed-form if it can be expressed using elementary functions.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $f(x)$ has no closed-form integral.\n\nBut the original problem is asking about the techniques to do this, not to actually prove it for a specific f(x). However, given the example provided, where the problem was restated with assumptions, perhaps the formatted problem should capture the essence of the question, which is about methods to prove the non-existence of closed-form integrals for certain functions. But the format requires \"Problem: <The problem>\", which in the example was a statement to prove.\n\nGiven that the original question is asking \"how to prove\" and \"what techniques are used\", but the format expects a problem statement like \"Prove that...\", there's a mismatch. The user might have intended for the problem to be rephrased into a statement that needs proving, even if the original is a request for methods.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem should be phrased as \"Determine the branch of mathematics and techniques used to prove that a function has no closed-form integral.\" But the example given by the user had a mathematical statement to prove. This is a bit conflicting.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, but adhering to the user's example, where the original problem was reformulated into a \"Prove that...\" statement with assumptions, perhaps I should structure the current problem similarly. Since the original question is about proving that certain functions have no closed-form integral, the problem statement could be \"Prove that the function f(x) = x^x has no closed-form integral,\" with assumptions that f(x) is elementary and closed-form is defined via elementary functions.\n\nHowever, the original question mentions multiple functions (x^x, sin(x)\/x) and is asking about the general technique. But the format requires a specific problem. This is challenging. Perhaps the best approach is to generalize the problem statement while including the key elements.\n\nAlternatively, considering the merged question: \"How to prove that some functions don't have a primitive,\" which is equivalent to proving no elementary antiderivative exists. So the problem could be phrased as \"Prove that the function f(x) has no elementary antiderivative,\" with assumptions that f(x) is elementary.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- $f(x)$ is an elementary function.\n- An elementary antiderivative is expressed using elementary functions.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $f(x)$ has no elementary antiderivative.\n\nBut the original question is asking about techniques to do this, not to actually prove it. However, the example given by the user seems to convert the original problem into a specific statement to prove, possibly adding assumptions. Given that, perhaps this is the expected approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are about the specific function, like in the example where n was assumed divisible by 7. If we take one of the example functions, say f(x) = x^x, then:\n\nAssumption:\n- $f(x) = x^x$.\n- A closed-form integral is defined using elementary functions.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $f(x) = x^x$ has no closed-form integral.\n\nBut the original question is general, not specifically about x^x. However, the merged question includes an example with sin(x)\/x. Given that, maybe the problem should be about a general function, but the assumptions would need to specify that f(x) is one of these functions. However, since the user's example added an assumption not present in the original problem (n divisible by 7), perhaps here we need to include assumptions that f(x) is elementary and that closed-form integrals are considered in elementary terms.\n\nI think the correct approach here is to list the assumptions that are implicit in the problem. Since the question is about proving no closed-form integral exists, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The function $f(x)$ is elementary.\n- A closed-form integral is an expression composed of elementary functions.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $f(x)$ has no closed-form integral.\n\nBut the original question is asking about how to prove such statements, not to actually prove it. However, the user's example transformed the original problem into a specific statement to prove, even if it altered the original conditions (like adding n divisible by 7). Given that inconsistency, perhaps the correct path is to structure the problem as requesting the proof for a general function, with the assumptions about elementary functions.\n\nAlternatively, since the example in the user's prompt seems to have an error (adding an assumption not in the original problem), perhaps the task is to extract the key elements from the question and structure them accordingly, even if the original problem is more general.\n\nGiven the original question's content, the key points are:\n\n- Functions like x^x and sin(x)\/x are claimed to have no closed-form integral.\n- The user wants to know the techniques to prove such statements.\n- The branch of mathematics involved is mentioned (differential algebra, Liouville's theorem).\n\nBut the format requires \"Problem: <The problem>\". If the problem is to \"Prove that function f(x) has no closed-form integral\", then the assumptions would relate to f(x) being a specific function and the definition of closed-form. But since the question is asking about methods in general, it's a bit off. However, following the user's example, which took a general problem and added specific assumptions, perhaps we need to structure it similarly.\n\nIn conclusion, after considering all factors, the formatted problem should have assumptions about the function being elementary and the closed-form integral defined via elementary functions, and the problem is to prove that such an integral doesn't exist. Even though the original question is about techniques, the format seems to require a specific problem statement to prove, so this is the best alignment.",
