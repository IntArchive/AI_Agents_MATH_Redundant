    "AcceptedAnswer":"As Steve D. noted, a finite dimensional vector space over a countable field is necessarily countable: if $v_1,\\ldots,v_n$ is a basis, then every vector in $V$ can be written uniquely as $\\alpha_1 v_1+\\cdots+\\alpha_n v_n$ for some scalars $\\alpha_1,\\ldots,\\alpha_n\\in F$, so the cardinality of the set of all vectors is exactly $|F|^n$. If $F$ is countable, then this is countable. Since $\\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable and $\\mathbb{Q}$ is countable, $\\mathbb{R}$ cannot be finite dimensional over $\\mathbb{Q}$. (Whether it has a basis or not depends on your set theory). Your further question in the comments, whether a vector space over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is finite dimensional if and only if the set of vectors is countable, has a negative answer. If the vector space is finite dimensional, then it is a countable set; but there are infinite-dimensional vector spaces over $\\mathbb{Q}$ that are countable as sets. The simplest example is $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$, the vector space of all polynomials with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Q}$, which is a countable set, and has dimension $\\aleph_0$, with basis $\\{1,x,x^2,\\ldots,x^n,\\ldots\\}$. Added: Of course, if $V$ is a vector space over $\\mathbb{Q}$, then it has countable dimension (finite or denumerable infinite) if and only if $V$ is countable as a set. So the counting argument in fact shows that not only is $\\mathbb{R}$ infinite dimensional over $\\mathbb{Q}$, but that (if you are working in an appropriate set theory) it is uncountably -dimensional over $\\mathbb{Q}$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem correctly. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into their specified format. The example they provided shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then the problem statement follows.\n\nLooking at the original question: \"Is there a quick proof as to why the vector space of $\\mathbb{R}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is infinite-dimensional?\" The user in the example included an assumption about the integer n being divisible by 7. But here, what are the assumptions?\n\nFirst, the problem is about the vector space $\\mathbb{R}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. So the vector space in question is $\\mathbb{R}$ considered as a vector space over the field $\\mathbb{Q}$. The question is asking for a proof that this vector space is infinite-dimensional. The original poster mentions that one way is to show the existence of non-algebraic numbers but is looking for a simpler proof.\n\nSo, what are the key assumptions here? The main objects involved are $\\mathbb{R}$ and $\\mathbb{Q}$. The problem doesn't state any specific conditions except that we're dealing with the vector space structure. Since the user example listed assumptions about the objects involved, maybe we need to state that $\\mathbb{R}$ is a vector space over $\\mathbb{Q}$. But that's part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Wait, the example had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So in that case, the assumptions were conditions on n.\n\nIn this problem, are there any implicit assumptions? The problem is asking to prove that the dimension is infinite. The standard proof would involve showing that if it were finite-dimensional, then every real number would be algebraic over $\\mathbb{Q}$, but since there exist transcendental numbers (non-algebraic), the dimension must be infinite. The original poster is asking if there's a simpler way than invoking transcendental numbers.\n\nBut for the assumptions part, perhaps we need to list the structure here. Let's see:\n\nAssumptions:\n- $\\mathbb{R}$ is a vector space over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n- The dimension of a vector space is the cardinality of its basis.\n\nWait, but these are more definitions than assumptions. The example given had assumptions on the variable n. Maybe in this case, there are no additional assumptions beyond the problem's setup. The problem is straightforward: prove that the vector space $\\mathbb{R}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ has infinite dimension. So perhaps the only assumption is that we're considering $\\mathbb{R}$ as a vector space over $\\mathbb{Q}$, but that's part of the problem statement.\n\nWait, the example's assumption included both that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. But in the original problem statement, it's \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems different. Let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But wait, the original says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the example was modified? Hmm, maybe the user made a mistake there. Alternatively, perhaps in the original problem, maybe there was a missing condition, and the user added it. But maybe I should focus on the current problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's example had an assumption that n is an integer and n divisible by 7, but the original problem said \"for every integer n\". That seems contradictory. Maybe the example was incorrect, but regardless, the instruction is to structure the current problem as per the format.\n\nGiven that, the problem is to prove that the vector space of R over Q is infinite-dimensional. The original question asks if there's a quick proof without invoking non-algebraic numbers. The assumptions here would be the standard ones: that R is a vector space over Q, and perhaps the definition of dimension. But maybe there's an implicit assumption that the dimension is finite? No, because the problem is to show it's infinite.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are no specific assumptions beyond the problem statement. In the example, the user included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (divisible by 7). But maybe that was part of the problem's hidden condition. Wait, maybe the original problem had a mistake. But regardless, in our case, the problem is as stated. So perhaps the assumption here is just that we're considering the vector space structure of R over Q, which is given.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an assumption that the real numbers form a vector space over the rationals, which is true because Q is a field and R is a Q-module, hence a vector space. But that's more of a given fact.\n\nGiven the example provided, the user seems to list the conditions or properties that the variables or objects in the problem must satisfy. In the original problem about A(n), the assumptions were that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But the original problem said \"for every integer n\", so maybe the user made an error. Perhaps in the actual problem, there was a condition that n is divisible by 7, but the original problem didn't state it. But perhaps that's a red herring.\n\nIn any case, for the current problem, the user wants to structure the problem as Assumptions (each line one property\/condition on one object) and then the problem statement.\n\nIn this case, the problem is to show that the vector space R over Q is infinite-dimensional. The standard approach uses transcendental numbers, but the user is asking for a simpler proof. So perhaps there are no additional assumptions beyond the problem setup. Therefore, the assumptions section might be minimal. Maybe just:\n\nAssumption:\n$\\mathbb{R}$ is considered as a vector space over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nBut is that an assumption or part of the problem statement? In the example, the assumption included \"n is an integer\", which was part of the original problem's quantifier. So perhaps here, the assumption is that $\\mathbb{R}$ is a vector space over $\\mathbb{Q}$, which is the context of the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no assumptions needed beyond what's in the problem statement, but the format requires listing assumptions. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe vector space in question is $\\mathbb{R}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that this vector space is infinite-dimensional.\n\nBut maybe the user wants to split the assumptions into separate lines even if they are part of the problem's setup. However, since the example had two assumptions (n is integer, n divisible by 7), which may have been part of the problem's original conditions, perhaps here we need to list any underlying assumptions required for the proof.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's an assumption that the dimension is finite, leading to a contradiction. But that's part of the proof method, not an assumption of the problem.\n\nGiven the example, perhaps the correct approach is to list the components that define the problem's setup as assumptions. Since the problem is about the vector space of R over Q being infinite-dimensional, the key objects are R and Q, and their relationship as vector space and field.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- $\\mathbb{R}$ is a vector space over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nBut that's the problem's premise. Maybe another assumption is that the dimension of a vector space is the cardinality of a basis. However, that's a standard definition. The example didn't include definitions as assumptions, just conditions on the variables.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to prove the dimension is infinite, maybe there's an implicit assumption that the dimension is finite, but that's part of the proof by contradiction.\n\nI think in this case, the main assumption is that we're working within the context of $\\mathbb{R}$ as a vector space over $\\mathbb{Q}$. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n$\\mathbb{R}$ is a vector space over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that this vector space is infinite-dimensional.\n\nBut the original problem's title is asking for a quick proof, and the question mentions non-algebraic numbers. However, the formatted problem should extract the problem and assumptions. Since the user example included assumptions that were perhaps from the problem (even if in the original problem it was stated as \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added divisibility by 7), perhaps there's a misunderstanding. But maybe I should proceed with what's given.\n\nThus, structuring the problem as:\n\nAssumption:\n$\\mathbb{R}$ is a vector space over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the vector space $\\mathbb{R}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is infinite-dimensional.\n\nBut is that redundant? The assumption already states that it's a vector space, so the problem is to show its dimension is infinite. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just as stated in the title: \"Is there a quick proof as to why the vector space of $\\mathbb{R}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is infinite-dimensional?\" So the problem is to provide a proof, and the assumptions are the basic setup.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no specific assumptions beyond the definitions, so the assumptions section could be empty. But the example had assumptions even when the original problem didn't state them (like n divisible by 7). So perhaps the user wants to include the necessary premises as assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key assumption is that the dimension is finite, and we need to derive a contradiction. But that's part of the proof technique.\n\nWait, no, the user's example listed assumptions that are given in the problem. The original problem said \"for every integer n\", and the formatted problem's assumptions were \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like a mistake. Because \"for every integer n\" doesn't restrict n to be divisible by 7. So perhaps the example is incorrect, but we have to follow the instruction regardless.\n\nIn the current problem, the question is about the vector space of R over Q. The problem is to prove it's infinite-dimensional. The assumptions would be the structure: that R is a vector space over Q. So the assumption is that the vector space exists, which it does, but maybe that's not necessary. Alternatively, if we take assumptions as the given conditions, perhaps there are none except the problem's context.\n\nHmm. Maybe the user wants to have each assumption as a single line, each applying to one object. In this case, the objects are R and Q. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe field of scalars is $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nAssumption:\nThe vector space is $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nBut that's splitting hairs. Alternatively, maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n$\\mathbb{R}$ is a vector space.\n\nAssumption:\nThe scalar field of the vector space is $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nBut these are two separate assumptions about the same object (the vector space). However, according to the example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n$\\mathbb{R}$ is a vector space over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThat's a single assumption about the vector space structure. Hence, the formatted problem would have that as the assumption and the problem as stated.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$\\mathbb{R}$ is a vector space over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nProblem: \nProve that the vector space of $\\mathbb{R}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is infinite-dimensional.\n###",
