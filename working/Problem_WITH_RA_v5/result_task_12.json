    "Content":"My youngest son is in $6$ th grade. He likes to play with numbers. Today, he showed me his latest finding. I call it his \"Sum of Some\" because he adds up some selected numbers from a series of numbers, and the sum equals a later number in that same series. I have translated his finding into the following equation: $$(100\\times2^n)+(10\\times2^{n+1})+2^{n+3}=2^{n+7}.$$ Why is this so? What is the proof or explanation? Is it true for any $n$ ? His own presentation of his finding: Every one of these numbers is two times the number before it. $1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192$ . I pick any one of them, times $100$ . Then I add the next one, times $10$ . Then I skip the next one. Then I add the one after that. If I then skip three ones and read the fourth, that one equals my sum!",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"It works because the number $$\n128\n$$\nhas two special properties: it is a power of $2$, and every digit is a power of $2$.  This means that we can write it in two separate ways: \\begin{align}\n128&=2^7\\\\\n128&=100\\times2^0+10\\times2^1+1\\times2^3\n\\end{align} Multiplying both sides by $2^n$ then gives: $$\n2^{n+7}=(100\\times2^n)+(10\\times2^{n+1})+2^{n+3}\n$$ Edit: others have done a better job of generalizing this, but I feel I should point out another obvious related sequence. $128$ is not the only power of $2$ whose digits are all powers of $2$ (or $0$).  For instance: $$\n1024 = 2^{10}\n$$ So another, similar kind of relation is given by: $$\n2^{n+10} = (1000\\times2^n)+(10\\times2^{n+1})+2^{n+2}\n$$ In your son's notation, that becomes: Every one of these numbers is two times the number before it. $1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192$. I pick any one of them, times $1000$.  Then I add the next one, times $10$.  Then I add the next one. If I then skip seven (!) ones and read the eighth, that one equals my sum! See if he likes that one.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Alright, let me tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what the user is asking. The problem is presented by a parent whose child discovered a numerical pattern, translated into an equation: (100×2ⁿ) + (10×2ⁿ⁺¹) + 2ⁿ⁺³ = 2ⁿ⁺⁷. The child noticed that by taking certain terms in the sequence of powers of 2, scaling them by 100, 10, and 1 respectively, and adding them up, the result equals another term further along the sequence. The parent wants to know why this works, if there's a proof, and whether it holds for any n.\n\nFirst, I'll verify if the equation holds true for specific values of n. Let's pick n=0. Then:\n\nLeft side: 100×2⁰ + 10×2¹ + 2³ = 100×1 + 10×2 + 8 = 100 + 20 + 8 = 128.\nRight side: 2⁷ = 128. It works.\n\nAnother test with n=1:\n\nLeft: 100×2 + 10×4 + 2⁴ = 200 + 40 + 16 = 256.\nRight: 2⁸ = 256. Also works.\n\nn=2:\n\nLeft: 100×4 + 10×8 + 2⁵ = 400 + 80 + 32 = 512.\nRight: 2⁹ = 512. Correct again.\n\nSo it seems to hold for these values. Now, to prove it generally. Let's simplify the left side algebraically:\n\nLeft side: 100×2ⁿ + 10×2ⁿ⁺¹ + 2ⁿ⁺³\n\nFactor out 2ⁿ:\n\n2ⁿ (100 + 10×2 + 2³) = 2ⁿ (100 + 20 + 8) = 2ⁿ × 128\n\n128 is 2⁷, so 2ⁿ × 2⁷ = 2ⁿ⁺⁷, which is the right side. Therefore, the equation simplifies to an identity, valid for any integer n. The child's observation works because when you factor out 2ⁿ, the coefficients (100, 10×2, and 8) sum to 128, which is 2⁷. Thus, the left side becomes 2ⁿ⁺⁷, matching the right side. This holds for all integer values of n, as the algebraic manipulation doesn't impose any restrictions on n. The \"skipping\" steps in the child's explanation correspond to selecting exponents that, when combined with the coefficients, align the exponents to add up correctly. Therefore, the explanation lies in factoring and recognizing powers of two.",
