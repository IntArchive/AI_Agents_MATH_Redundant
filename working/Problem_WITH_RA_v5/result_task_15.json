    "Content":"I would like to prove that $\\displaystyle\\sum_{\\substack{n=1\\\\n\\text{ odd}}}^{\\infty}\\frac{n}{e^{n\\pi}+1}=\\frac1{24}$. I found a solution by myself 10 hours after I posted it, here it is: $$f(x)=\\sum_{\\substack{n=1\\\\n\\text{ odd}}}^{\\infty}\\frac{nx^n}{1+x^n},\\quad\\quad g(x)=\\displaystyle\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{nx^n}{1-x^n},$$ then I must prove that $f(e^{-\\pi})=\\frac1{24}$. It was not hard to find the relation between $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, namely $f(x)=g(x)-4g(x^2)+4g(x^4)$. Note that $g(x)$ is a Lambert series , so by expanding the Taylor series for the denominators and reversing the two sums, I get $$g(x)=\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\sigma(n)x^n$$ where $\\sigma$ is the divisor function $\\sigma(n)=\\sum_{d\\mid n}d$. I then define for complex $\\tau$ the function \n$$G_2(\\tau)=\\frac{\\pi^2}3\\Bigl(1-24\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\sigma(n)e^{2\\pi in\\tau}\\Bigr)$$ so that\n$$f(e^{-\\pi})=g(e^{-\\pi})-4g(e^{-2\\pi})+4g(e^{-4\\pi})=\\frac1{24}+\\frac{-G_2(\\frac i2)+4G_2(i)-4G_2(2i)}{8\\pi^2}.$$ But it is proven in Apostol \"Modular forms and Dirichlet Series\", page 69-71 that $G_2\\bigl(-\\frac1{\\tau}\\bigr)=\\tau^2G_2(\\tau)-2\\pi i\\tau$, which gives $\\begin{cases}G_2(i)=-G_2(i)+2\\pi\\\\ G_2(\\frac i2)=-4G_2(2i)+4\\pi\\end{cases}\\quad$. This is exactly was needed to get the desired result. Hitoshigoto oshimai ! I find that sum fascinating. $e,\\pi$ all together to finally get a rational. This is why mathematics is beautiful!

    "AcceptedAnswer":"We will use the Mellin transform technique. Recalling the Mellin transform and its inverse $$ F(s) =\\int_0^{\\infty} x^{s-1} f(x)dx, \\quad\\quad f(x)=\\frac{1}{2 \\pi i} \\int_{c-i \\infty}^{c+i \\infty} x^{-s} F(s)\\, ds.  $$ Now, let's consider the function $$ f(x)= \\frac{x}{e^{\\pi x}+1}. $$ Taking the Mellin transform of $f(x)$, we get $$ F(s)={\\pi }^{-s-1}\\Gamma  \\left( s+1 \\right)  \\left(1- {2}^{-s} \\right) \n\\zeta  \\left( s+1 \\right),$$ where $\\zeta(s)$ is the zeta function . Representing the function in terms of the inverse Mellin Transform, we have $$ \\frac{x}{e^{\\pi x}+1}=\\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\\int_{C}{\\pi }^{-s-1}\\Gamma  \\left( s+1 \\right)  \\left( 1-{2}^{-s} \\right) \n\\zeta  \\left( s+1 \\right) x^{-s}ds. $$ Substituting $x=2n+1$ and summing yields $$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{2n+1}{e^{\\pi (2n+1)}+1}=\\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\\int_{C}{\\pi}^{-s-1}\\Gamma  \\left( s+1 \\right)\\left(1-{2}^{-s} \\right) \n\\zeta\\left( s+1 \\right) \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}(2n+1)^{-s}ds$$ $$ = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\\int_{C}{\\pi }^{-s-1}\\Gamma  \\left( s+1 \\right)  \\left(1-{2}^{-s} \\right)^2\\zeta\\left( s+1 \\right) \\zeta(s)ds.$$ Now, the only contribution of the poles comes from the simple pole $s=1$ of $\\zeta(s)$ and the residue equals to $\\frac{1}{24}$. So, the sum is given by $$ \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{2n+1}{e^{\\pi (2n+1)}+1}=\\frac{1}{24} $$ Notes: 1) $$ \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}(2n+1)^{-s}= \\left(1- {2}^{-s} \\right) \\zeta  \\left( s \\right).  $$ 2) The residue of the simple pole $s=1$, which is the pole of the zeta function, can be calculated as $$ r = \\lim_{s=1}(s-1)({\\pi }^{-s-1}\\Gamma  \\left( s+1 \\right)  \\left({2}^{-s}-1 \\right)^2\\zeta\\left( s+1 \\right) \\zeta(s))$$ $$  =  \\lim_{s\\to 1}(s-1)\\zeta(s)\\lim_{s\\to 1}  {\\pi }^{-s-1}\\Gamma  \\left( s+1 \\right)  \\left({2}^{-s}-1 \\right)^2\\zeta\\left( s+1 \\right)  = \\frac{1}{24}. $$ For calculating the above limit, we used the facts $$ \\lim_{s\\to 1}(s-1)\\zeta(s)=1, \\quad \\zeta(2)=\\frac{\\pi^2}{6}. $$ 3) Here is the technique for computing the Mellin transform of $f(x)$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original problem is about proving an infinite series sum equals 1\/24. The user provided their own solution involving functions f(x) and g(x), relating them through manipulations and modular forms. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem statement is the series sum from n=1 to infinity, with n odd, of n\/(e^{nπ} +1) equals 1\/24. The assumptions would be the conditions given. The problem mentions n is odd, and the summation is over all odd positive integers. The original question doesn't state any additional conditions like convergence, but maybe the series is assumed to converge. Also, the solution uses functions f(x) and g(x), but those are part of the solution attempt, not the problem's assumptions.\n\nSo the main assumptions are that n starts at 1, increments by 2 (since n is odd), and the terms are n\/(e^{nπ} +1). The problem is to prove the sum equals 1\/24. There might be an implicit assumption that the series converges, but since the user is asking to prove the sum equals a specific value, maybe that's part of the problem rather than an assumption. \n\nWait, the problem as stated in the title is just the sum equals 1\/24. The assumptions are the conditions under which this holds. The problem is in the context of real numbers, complex analysis? But the user didn't specify any particular constraints. The key explicit assumption is that n runs over odd positive integers. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is a positive integer,\n- n is odd,\n- the summation is from n=1 to infinity.\n\nBut according to the example given earlier, each assumption should address only one property applied to one object. So for example, in the example, they had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. So here, similarly, the first assumption is that n is a positive integer (since the sum starts at n=1 and goes to infinity), and second that n is odd. The problem is to prove the sum equals 1\/24. The original problem doesn't mention any other conditions, so maybe those are the only assumptions. The problem is the sum of n\/(e^{nπ} +1) over odd n equals 1\/24. \n\nSo formatted as:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nn is odd,\nthe summation is taken over all positive odd integers n from 1 to infinity.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$\\sum_{\\substack{n=1\\\\n\\text{ odd}}}^{\\infty}\\frac{n}{e^{n\\pi}+1}=\\frac{1}{24}.$$\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is separate. Let me check the original problem. The original problem says: \"Prove that $\\displaystyle\\sum_{\\substack{n=1\\\\n\\text{ odd}}}^{\\infty}\\frac{n}{e^{n\\pi}+1}=\\frac1{24}$.\" So the conditions on n are part of the summation index. So the assumptions would be:\n\n1. n is a positive integer (since the sum starts at n=1 and goes to infinity),\n2. n is odd,\n3. the summation is taken over all such n.\n\nBut maybe the first two can be combined into \"n is a positive odd integer\". But in the example, they separated \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So following that example, here it's similar. So \"n is a positive integer\" and \"n is odd\". \n\nThe summation being over n=1 to infinity is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Wait, the example had \"for every integer n\", which was an assumption. But here, the sum is over n from 1 to infinity with n odd. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is a positive integer,\n- n is odd,\n- the series is summed over all such n from 1 to infinity.\n\nBut maybe the third is redundant as the problem states the summation. However, according to the example, the problem statement includes the summation notation, so perhaps the assumptions are just the conditions on n. The problem itself is to prove the equality. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nn is odd.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$\\sum_{\\substack{n=1\\\\n\\text{ odd}}}^{\\infty}\\frac{n}{e^{n\\pi}+1}=\\frac{1}{24}.$$\n\nBut the example included \"n is divisible by 7\" as a separate assumption. So in this case, n being odd is a separate assumption. So I think that's correct. The problem is the sum over positive odd integers n of n\/(e^{nπ}+1) equals 1\/24. The assumptions are that n is a positive integer and n is odd. The summation from 1 to infinity is part of the problem's structure. So the formatted problem would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nn is a positive integer,\nn is odd.\nProblem: \nProve that $$\\sum_{\\substack{n=1\\\\n\\text{ odd}}}^{\\infty}\\frac{n}{e^{n\\pi}+1}=\\frac{1}{24}.$$\n###\n\nYes, that seems to align with the example provided. The user's solution involves transforming the series and using modular forms, but those are part of the solution, not the problem's assumptions. The key assumptions are the nature of n (positive integer, odd) and the structure of the series. The problem is to show the sum equals 1\/24.",
