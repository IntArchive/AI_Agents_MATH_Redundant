    "Content":"Define a function $f(\\alpha, \\beta)$, $\\alpha \\in (-1,1)$, $\\beta \\in (-1,1)$ as $$ f(\\alpha, \\beta) = \\int_0^{\\infty} dx \\: \\frac{x^{\\alpha}}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}$$ One can use, for example, the Residue Theorem to show that $$ f(\\alpha, \\beta) = \\frac{\\pi \\sin{\\left (\\pi \\alpha \\beta\\right )}}{ \\sin{\\left (\\pi \\alpha\\right )} \\,  \\sin{\\left (\\pi \\beta\\right )}} $$ Clearly, from this latter expression, $f(\\alpha, \\beta) = f(\\beta, \\alpha)$.  My question is, can one see this symmetry directly from the integral expression?",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"I hope this answers your question. $$\\begin{align}\n \\int_0^{\\infty} dx \\: \\frac{x^{\\alpha}}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}\n&= \\int_0^{\\infty} x^{\\alpha}\\,\\mathscr M\\circ\\mathscr M^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}\\right\\} dx\\\\\n&= \\int_0^{\\infty} \\int^\\infty_0 x^{\\alpha}y^{\\beta-1}\\mathscr M^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}\\right\\}(y)\\,\\, dydx\\\\\n&= \\int_0^{\\infty} \\int^\\infty_0 x^{\\alpha}y^{\\beta}\\cdot\\frac1y \\mathscr M^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}\\right\\}(y)\\,\\, dydx\\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$ Ideally, if $\\displaystyle{\\frac1y \\mathscr M^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}\\right\\}(y)}$ is symmetric in $x$ and $y$ , then we got what the OP wants. Surprisingly, $$\\frac1y \\mathscr M^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}\\right\\}(y)=\\frac2{\\pi}\\frac{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\ln x\\ln y}{\\pi}\\right)}{(x^2-1)(y^2-1)}\\qquad(\\star)$$ which is obviously symmetric. The rest of the answer is devoted to the proof of $(\\star)$ . $$I:=\\frac1y \\mathscr M^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}\\right\\}(y)\n=\\frac1{2\\pi iy}\\int^{i\\infty}_{-i\\infty}\\underbrace{\\frac{y^{-\\beta}}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}}_{:= f(\\beta)}d\\beta$$ Let's look at the poles and residues of the integrand, so that this integral can be evaluated by residue theorem later. The poles are all simple, and are located at $$p_n^{\\pm}=\\pm\\left(\\frac{\\ln x}{\\pi i}+1\\right)+2n:=\\pm c\\pm 1+2n\\qquad n\\in\\mathbb Z$$ Moreover, the residues are $$\\operatorname{Res}(f(\\beta),\\beta=p_n^{\\pm})=\\pm\\frac{y^{\\mp c\\mp 1-2n}}{\\pi i(1-x^2)}$$ For $y>1$ , $f(\\beta)$ decays exponentially on the right half plane. By residue theorem, $$\\begin{align}\nI &=\\frac1{2\\pi i y}\\cdot -2\\pi i\\sum\\text{residue on the right half plane} \\\\\n&=-\\frac1y\\left(\\sum^\\infty_{n=0}\\operatorname{Res}(f(\\beta),p_n^{+})+\\sum^\\infty_{n=1}\\operatorname{Res}(f(\\beta),p_n^{-})\\right) \\\\\n&=-\\frac1{\\pi i(1-x^2)y}\\left[\\frac{y^{-c-1}}{1-y^{-2}}+\\frac{y^{c+1}}{1-y^2}\\right] \\\\\n&=-\\frac1{\\pi i(1-x^2)}\\left[\\frac{y^{-c-2}}{1-y^{-2}}+\\frac{y^{c}}{1-y^2}\\right] \\\\\n&=-\\frac1{\\pi i(1-x^2)}\\left[\\frac{y^{-c}}{y^{2}-1}+\\frac{y^{c}}{1-y^2}\\right] \\\\\n&=-\\frac1{\\pi i(1-x^2)(1-y^2)}\\left(e^{\\ln y\\ln x\/(\\pi i)}-e^{-\\ln y\\ln x\/(\\pi i)}\\right)\\\\\n&=\\frac2{\\pi(1-x^2)(1-y^2)}\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\ln x\\ln y}{\\pi}\\right)\\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$ For $0<y<1$ , $f(\\beta)$ decays exponentially on the left half plane. By residue theorem, $$I=\\frac1{2\\pi i y}\\cdot 2\\pi i\\sum\\text{residue on the left half plane}$$ It is not a surprise that the sum is also equal to $\\displaystyle{\\frac2{\\pi(1-x^2)(1-y^2)}\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\ln x\\ln y}{\\pi}\\right)}$ . This can be seen as an instance of analytic continuation, due to the removable singularity at $y=1$ . In conclusion, $$\\frac1{2\\pi i}\\int^{i\\infty}_{-i\\infty}\\frac{y^{-\\beta-1}}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}d\\beta=\\frac2{\\pi}\\frac{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\ln x\\ln y}{\\pi}\\right)}{(x^2-1)(y^2-1)}$$ $$ \\int_0^{\\infty} dx \\: \\frac{x^{\\alpha}}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}\n= \\frac2{\\pi}\\int_0^{\\infty} \\int^\\infty_0 x^{\\alpha}y^{\\beta}\\frac{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\ln x\\ln y}{\\pi}\\right)}{(x^2-1)(y^2-1)}dxdy$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me first read through the original question carefully.\n\nThe user defines a function f(α, β) where α and β are in (-1, 1). The function is an integral from 0 to infinity of x^α divided by (1 + 2x cos(πβ) + x²) dx. They mention that using the Residue Theorem, they derived an expression involving sine functions, and from that expression, it's clear that f(α, β) = f(β, α). The question is whether one can see this symmetry directly from the integral expression without using the derived formula.\n\nNow, applying the format. The assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. Let's break it down:\n\n- The function f is defined with two variables, α and β.\n- α is in the interval (-1, 1).\n- β is in the interval (-1, 1).\n- The integral defining f is from 0 to infinity.\n- The integrand is x^α \/ (1 + 2x cos(πβ) + x²).\n\nThe problem is to show the symmetry f(α, β) = f(β, α) directly from the integral, not using the explicit formula derived via residues.\n\nWait, the original problem mentions \"One can use, for example, the Residue Theorem...\" but the answer is supposed to structure the problem, not the solution. So the assumptions are about the parameters and the integral. The problem is to see the symmetry from the integral expression.\n\nI need to check if all the conditions are covered. The variables α and β are each in (-1,1), the integral is from 0 to infinity, and the integrand is as given. The problem is to show f(α, β) = f(β, α) directly from the integral.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- α is a real number in (-1, 1),\n- β is a real number in (-1, 1),\n- f(α, β) is defined as the integral from 0 to ∞ of x^α \/ (1 + 2x cos(πβ) + x²) dx.\n\nProblem: Show that f(α, β) = f(β, α) directly from the integral expression.\n\nI think that's all. The original problem doesn't have any additional constraints beyond α and β being in (-1,1). The integral is definite from 0 to infinity, so that's part of the definition. The key point is to note the variables' domains and the integral's form. The problem is about symmetry between α and β in the integral expression.",

Both are necessary for the integral to be well-defined and convergent.\n\nJustification:\n1.  **Necessity of Assumption 1 (α ∈ (-1, 1)):** This condition ensures the convergence of the integral at its limits.\n    *   For convergence as x → 0⁺, the integrand `x^α\/(1 + 2x cos(πβ) + x²)` behaves like `x^α`. The integral `∫₀ x^α dx` converges only if `α > -1`.\n    *   For convergence as x → ∞, the integrand behaves like `x^α\/x² = x^(α-2)`. The integral `∫ x^(α-2) dx` converges only if `α - 2 < -1`, which implies `α < 1`.\n    Therefore, the condition `α ∈ (-1, 1)` is essential.\n\n2.  **Necessity of Assumption 2 (β ∈ (-1, 1)):** This condition prevents a non-integrable singularity within the domain of integration.\n    *   The denominator `1 + 2x cos(πβ) + x²` has positive real roots if and only if `cos(πβ) = -1`, which occurs when `β` is an odd integer (e.g., ±1, ±3, ...).\n    *   If `β` were an odd integer, the denominator would become `(x-1)²`, creating a non-integrable singularity at `x=1`.\n    *   The assumption `β ∈ (-1, 1)` excludes these problematic integer values, ensuring the denominator is never zero for `x > 0`.\n    Therefore, this condition is also essential.\n\nfinal:There are no redundant assumptions in the given problem.",
