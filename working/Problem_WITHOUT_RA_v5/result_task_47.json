    "AcceptedAnswer":"Here's a probabilistic proof. Let $X_t$ ($t=0,1,\\ldots$) be a Markov process on the positive integers with $X_0=1$ and, for each $t\\ge0$,\n$$\nX_{t+1}=\\begin{cases}\n2X_t,&\\text{with probability }1\/2,\\\\\n3X_t,&\\text{with probability }1\/3,\\\\\n6X_t,&\\text{with probability }1\/6.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nIf we let $p_t(n)=\\mathbb{P}(X_t=n)$ then we see that\n$$\np_{t+1}(n)=1_{\\{2\\mid n\\}}p_t(n\/2)\/2+1_{\\{3\\mid n\\}}p_t(n\/3)\/3+1_{\\{6\\mid n\\}}p_t(n\/6)\/6.\n$$\nSumming over $t$ gives the probability that $X$ ever visits state $n$.\n$$\np(n)=\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_t1_{\\{X_t=n\\}}\\right]=\\sum_t\\mathbb{P}(X_t=n)=\\sum_tp_t(n).\n$$\nThis satisfies\n$$\np(n)=\\frac121_{\\{2\\mid n\\}}p(n\/2)+\\frac131_{\\{3\\mid n\\}}p(n\/3)+\\frac161_{\\{6\\mid n\\}}p(n\/6)\n$$\nfor $n\\gt1$ and $p(1)=1$.\nNow, let $a_n$ be the sequence defined in the question and set $b_n=a_n-a_{n-1}$.

We then see that $b_n$ satisfies the same initial condition and recurrence relation as $2np(n)$, so $b_n=2np(n)$. Hence,\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ccr}\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{a_N-1}{N}&=\\frac2N\\sum_{n=1}^Nnp(n)=\\frac2N\\sum_{n=1}^N\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_tn1_{\\{X_t=n\\}}\\right]\\\\\n&=\\frac2N\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_tX_t1_{\\{X_t\\le N\\}}\\right].\n\\end{align}&&{\\rm(1)}\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThe last equality here is obtained by moving the sum over $n$ inside the expectation and commuting with the integral. We can compute (1) in the limit as $N\\to\\infty$ using renewal theory . The random variables $U_t=\\log(X_t\/X_{t-1})$ are independent and identically distributed with $\\mathbb{P}(U_t=\\log a)=a^{-1}$ for $a\\in\\{2,3,6\\}$. It has mean $c\\equiv\\mathbb{E}[U_t]=(\\log 432)\/6$. In terms of the process $Y_t=U_1+\\cdots+U_t$, (1) becomes\n$$\n\\frac{a_N}N=2\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_t 1_{\\{Y_t-\\log N\\le0\\}}e^{Y_t-\\log N}\\right]+\\frac1N.\n$$\nThe renewal theorem says that, in the limit as $\\log N\\to\\infty$, this converges to\n$$\n2c^{-1}\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty 1_{\\{y\\le0\\}}e^ydy=\\frac2c=\\frac{12}{\\log 432}.\n$$\nI'm using the version of the renewal theorem stated in Kallenberg, Foundations of Modern Probability (Second Ed.), Theorem 9.20, and also known as the Key Renewal Theorem. The precondition on the distribution of $U_t$ for this to apply (other than integrability) is that its support is not contained in $\\alpha\\mathbb{Z}$ for any $\\alpha$. This is true as the ratios of $\\log2,\\log3,\\log6$ are not all rational.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about showing that the limit of a_n over n as n approaches infinity equals 12 divided by the logarithm of 432. The sequence is defined recursively with a_0 = 1 and a_n being the sum of terms based on floor functions of n divided by 2, 3, and 6.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. Each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. Let's break it down.\n\n1. The initial condition: a_0 is set to 1. So that's one assumption.\n2. The recursive formula: a_n is defined as the sum of a_floor(n\/2), a_floor(n\/3), and a_floor(n\/6). Each of these terms involves the floor function, which is the largest integer not greater than the argument. Since each term here is a separate application of the floor function to different divisions of n, they might need to be individual assumptions. But wait, the problem statement combines them into one expression. However, the example given in the problem splits each condition into separate lines. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the assumptions were \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". So each assumption is a single condition on one object. Here, the definition of a_n involves multiple terms, but maybe each term can be considered part of the same recursive definition. But the floor functions are applied to n\/2, n\/3, n\/6. However, the problem states that a_n is equal to the sum of those three terms. So perhaps the entire recursive formula is a single assumption? But according to the example, each assumption is a separate line. Wait, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\" and \"divisible by 7\", but the formatted problem lists them as separate assumptions. So here, maybe each part of the recursive definition should be separate? Wait, but the recursive formula is a single equation. Hmm.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"Let a_0 =1 and a_n = ...\". So there are two main assumptions here: the initial condition and the recursive formula. But the recursive formula itself includes multiple components. However, according to the example, the problem's assumptions are split into individual lines. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\na_0 = 1,\nFor all n ≥ 1, a_n = a_{floor(n\/2)} + a_{floor(n\/3)} + a_{floor(n\/6)}.\n\nBut the example splits \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. So in this case, the initial condition and the recursive definition would be two separate assumptions. Also, the floor function is mentioned as part of the problem statement, but perhaps the definition of floor is part of the problem's context and not an assumption. Wait, the original problem says \"where ⌊x⌋ is the largest integer not greater than x\". So that's a definition provided in the problem, not an assumption. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. a_0 = 1\n2. For each integer n ≥ 1, a_n = a_{floor(n\/2)} + a_{floor(n\/3)} + a_{floor(n\/6)}\n\nBut the example shows that assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property. So the initial condition is one line, the recursive formula is another line. Also, maybe the problem mentions that n is a positive integer? Wait, the original problem says \"Let a_0 =1\" and then defines a_n for n in general. But the problem is about the limit as n approaches infinity, so n is a positive integer going to infinity. However, the problem may not explicitly state that n is an integer, but since the sequence is defined for n as an integer (as a_0 is given and then recursively for n=1,2,...), so maybe that's an implicit assumption. But in the example, the first assumption is \"n is an integer\". So here, maybe we need to list \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. Wait, the problem says \"for n→∞\", so n is an integer variable here. But in the problem statement, the user wrote \"Let a_0=1 and a_n=...\" which implies that n is an integer index. So perhaps we should list:\n\nAssumptions:\n- a_0 = 1,\n- For each integer n ≥ 1, a_n = a_{⌊n\/2⌋} + a_{⌊n\/3⌋} + a_{⌊n\/6⌋},\n- ⌊x⌋ is the floor function (largest integer ≤ x).\n\nBut in the example, the floor function's definition was included in the problem statement, not in the assumptions. Wait, looking back at the example:\n\nOriginal problem had \"where ⌊x⌋ is the largest integer not greater than x\". In the formatted problem, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. The problem statement then included the definition of A(n) with the floor function (but in the example, there was no floor function; the example was about divisibility). Wait, maybe in this problem, the floor function's definition is part of the problem's context, not an assumption. But in the problem statement, it's defined explicitly. So perhaps the formatted problem should include that as part of the problem statement? Hmm.\n\nWait, the user's example format for the problem includes the problem statement with the LaTeX, and the assumptions are separate. So in the original problem, the floor function is defined, but in the formatted problem, perhaps that's considered part of the problem's statement. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", and the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, then the problem statement was about proving divisibility. The floor function's definition was part of the problem statement in the original but wasn't listed as an assumption. Wait, in the example given by the user, the original problem didn't use floor functions. The user's example had the problem statement as \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem's assumptions were \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Then the problem was to prove it's divisible by 91.\n\nSo in this current problem, the definition of the floor function is part of the problem's context, so perhaps it's included in the problem statement, not the assumptions. So the assumptions would be:\n\n1. a_0 = 1\n2. For each integer n ≥ 1, a_n = a_{⌊n\/2⌋} + a_{⌊n\/3⌋} + a_{⌊n\/6⌋}\n\nAnd the problem statement is to show the limit, with the note that ⌊x⌋ is the floor function. So maybe the problem statement includes that definition. However, in the user's example, the problem statement includes the floor function's definition. But in the formatted problem, the problem statement just restates the problem. Wait, in the user's example, the formatted problem's problem section is \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91.\" The original problem had \"for every integer n\", which became an assumption.\n\nSo in this case, the problem's floor function definition is part of the problem statement. Therefore, the assumptions are the initial condition and the recursive definition. The floor function is part of the problem's notation, so it's included in the problem statement.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\na_0 = 1,\nFor each integer n ≥ 1, a_n = a_{⌊n\/2⌋} + a_{⌊n\/3⌋} + a_{⌊n\/6⌋}.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\dfrac{a_{n}}{n}=\\dfrac{12}{\\log{432}},$$ where $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is the largest integer not greater than $x$.\n\nBut wait, the user's example had each assumption on a separate line. So \"a_0 =1\" is one assumption, the recursive formula is another. Also, maybe \"For each integer n ≥1\" is part of the assumption? So:\n\nAssumption:\na_0 = 1,\nFor each integer n ≥ 1, a_n = a_{⌊n\/2⌋} + a_{⌊n\/3⌋} + a_{⌊n\/6⌋},\n⌊x⌋ is the floor function (largest integer not greater than x).\n\nWait, but the original problem already defines the floor function. The user's example didn't include definitions in assumptions, but if it's part of the problem's notation, maybe it's included in the problem statement. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the floor function is part of the problem's given definitions, so it's included in the problem statement. So the problem statement would restate the definition of floor. Therefore, in the formatted problem:\n\nProblem:\nShow that $$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\dfrac{a_{n}}{n}=\\dfrac{12}{\\log{432}},$$ where $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is the largest integer not greater than $x$.\n\nAnd the assumptions are:\n\n- a_0 =1,\n- For each integer n ≥1, a_n = a_{⌊n\/2⌋} + a_{⌊n\/3⌋} + a_{⌊n\/6⌋}.\n\nBecause the floor function is defined in the problem statement. So following the example, the assumptions are separate conditions. The floor function is part of the problem's notation, explained in the problem.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have two assumptions: the initial term and the recursive formula.\n\nAdditionally, the problem might assume that n is a positive integer approaching infinity. But in the original problem, n is the index of the sequence, so it's implicitly an integer. The example included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So perhaps here, we need to include \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. But in the original problem, since the sequence is defined for integers n, and the limit is as n approaches infinity (which is over integers?), but in analysis, limits as n→∞ usually consider n as a positive integer unless specified otherwise. However, the problem might not need to state that n is an integer because the recursive definition uses floor functions, which are applied to real numbers, but the sequence is defined for integer n. Wait, the problem says \"Let a_0=1\" and \"a_n = ...\" for n, which is presumably integer n. Therefore, the index n is an integer. So perhaps the assumption \"n is an integer\" is necessary. But in the example, the user included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem was \"for every integer n\", so in the formatted problem, they listed that as an assumption. Here, the original problem defines a sequence a_n, which is by definition indexed by integers. So perhaps \"n is an integer\" is an implicit assumption, but according to the user's example, it's better to list it explicitly.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- a_0 =1,\n- n is an integer,\n- For each integer n ≥1, a_n = a_{⌊n\/2⌋} + a_{⌊n\/3⌋} + a_{⌊n\/6⌋}.\n\nBut wait, \"n is an integer\" is a general condition. However, in the recursive formula, we have \"For each integer n ≥1\", so maybe the third assumption is \"For each integer n ≥1, a_n = ...\", which already includes that n is an integer. Therefore, maybe we don't need to list \"n is an integer\" separately. The example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions because they were two separate conditions. Here, the recursive formula is defined for integers n≥1, so it's part of the same assumption. So perhaps:\n\nAssumptions:\n- a_0 =1,\n- For each integer n ≥1, a_n = a_{⌊n\/2⌋} + a_{⌊n\/3⌋} + a_{⌊n\/6⌋}.\n\nThen, the problem statement includes the definition of floor function.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\na_0 = 1,\nFor each integer n ≥ 1, a_n = a_{⌊n\/2⌋} + a_{⌊n\/3⌋} + a_{⌊n\/6⌋}.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\dfrac{a_{n}}{n}=\\dfrac{12}{\\log{432}},$$ where $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is the largest integer not greater than $x$.\n\nYes, that seems to align with the example. Each assumption is on a separate line, addressing one condition. The problem statement includes the definition of the floor function as part of the problem's context.",

Let the function f(x) = 1\/x^p. For the Integral Test to be applicable, we must verify three conditions for x ≥ 1:\n1.  f(x) must be continuous.\n2.  f(x) must be positive.\n3.  f(x) must be decreasing.\n\nLet's check these conditions for p > 1 and x ≥ 1:\n1.  **Continuity:** The function f(x) = 1\/x^p is a rational function whose denominator is non-zero for x ≥ 1. Thus, f(x) is continuous on the interval [1, ∞).\n2.  **Positivity:** For x ≥ 1, x is positive. Any real power p of a positive number is positive, so x^p > 0. Therefore, f(x) = 1\/x^p is positive.\n3.  **Decreasing:** We examine the derivative of f(x):\n    f'(x) = d\/dx (x⁻ᵖ) = -p * x⁻ᵖ⁻¹ = -p \/ xᵖ⁺¹\n    Since p > 1 and x ≥ 1, both p and xᵖ⁺¹ are positive. This makes the derivative f'(x) negative for all x ≥ 1. A negative derivative implies that the function f(x) is strictly decreasing on the interval [1, ∞).\n\nAll three conditions of the Integral Test are satisfied. The test states that the infinite series Σ_{n=1 to ∞} f(n) converges if and only if the improper integral ∫[1, ∞] f(x) dx converges.\n\nWe now evaluate the integral:\n∫[1, ∞] (1\/x^p) dx = lim_{b→∞} ∫[1, b] x⁻ᵖ dx\n= lim_{b→∞} [ (x⁻ᵖ⁺¹) \/ (-p+1) ] from 1 to b\n= lim_{b→∞} [ (b¹⁻ᵖ) \/ (1-p) - (1¹⁻ᵖ) \/ (1-p) ]\n= (1 \/ (1-p)) * lim_{b→∞} [ b¹⁻ᵖ - 1 ]\n\nSince p > 1, the exponent (1-p) is negative. As b → ∞, b¹⁻ᵖ → 0.\nTherefore, the limit is:\n= (1 \/ (1-p)) * (0 - 1)\n= -1 \/ (1-p)\n= 1 \/ (p-1)\n\nSince the integral converges to the finite value 1\/(p-1), the series Σ_{n=1 to ∞} (1\/n^p) must also converge by the Integral Test.\n\nproof:\nProblem:\nGiven p > 1, prove that the series Σ_{n=1 to ∞} (1\/n^p) converges.\n\nProof:\nWe use the Integral Test.
