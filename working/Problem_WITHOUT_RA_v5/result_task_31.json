    "AcceptedAnswer":"$$|x| + |y -x| \\ge |x + y -x| = |y|$$ $$|y| + |x -y| \\ge |y + x -y| = |x|$$ Move $|x|$ to the right hand side in the first inequality and $|y|$ to the right hand side in the second inequality. We get $$|y -x| \\ge |y| - |x|$$ $$|x -y| \\ge |x| -|y|.$$ From absolute value properties, we know that $|y-x| = |x-y|,$ and if $t \\ge a$ and $t \\ge −a$ then $t \\ge |a|$ . Combining these two facts together, we get the reverse triangle inequality: $$|x-y| \\ge \\bigl||x|-|y|\\bigr|.$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to prove the reverse triangle inequality, ||x| - |y|| ≤ |x - y|, using only the standard triangle inequality which states |x + y| ≤ |x| + |y|. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the triangle inequality and think about how to manipulate it to get the reverse form. The reverse triangle inequality deals with the absolute difference of the magnitudes of x and y, so maybe I can express |x| and |y| in terms of each other using the triangle inequality.\n\nLet me start by considering |x| = |x - y + y|. Applying the triangle inequality here, we get |x| ≤ |x - y| + |y|. If I rearrange this inequality, it becomes |x| - |y| ≤ |x - y|. Similarly, if I switch x and y, I have |y| - |x| ≤ |y - x|. Since |y - x| is the same as |x - y|, this simplifies to |y| - |x| ≤ |x - y|. \n\nCombining these two results, we see that both |x| - |y| and |y| - |x| are less than or equal to |x - y|. The maximum of these two expressions is exactly ||x| - |y||, which means that ||x| - |y|| ≤ |x - y|. \n\nWait, but does this cover all cases? Let me check with some examples. Suppose x and y are both positive. If x > y, then |x| - |y| = x - y, and |x - y| is x - y, so equality holds. If y > x, then |y| - |x| = y - x, which is equal to |x - y|. So in these cases, the inequality holds as equality. What if one is positive and the other negative? Let's say x is positive and y is negative. Then |x| - |y| would be x - (-y) if y is negative, but wait, y is negative so |y| = -y. So |x| - |y| is x - (-y) = x + y. But |x - y| would be |x - (-|y|)| = |x + |y||, which is x + |y| since both are positive. So |x| - |y| = x + y (if y is negative) compared to |x - y| = x + |y|. Wait, if y is negative, then |y| = -y, so |x - y| = x - y (since y is negative, subtracting a negative is adding). But x - y would be x + |y|. So |x| - |y| = x - |y|. So x - |y| ≤ x + |y|, which is always true because |y| is non-negative. But this seems like a different approach. Maybe my initial approach still holds. \n\nAlternatively, another way is to note that ||x| - |y|| is the maximum of |x| - |y| and |y| - |x|, and both are less than or equal to |x - y| as per the triangle inequality applications. Therefore, combining these gives the desired result. \n\nSo the key steps are applying the triangle inequality to |x| and |y| by expressing them as |x - y + y| and |y - x + x|, then rearranging to get inequalities involving |x| - |y| and |y| - |x|, and finally recognizing that the absolute value of their difference is bounded by |x - y|.",
