However, $Y$ is a finite simplicial complex (by assumption 6), so $H^2(Y)$ has finite rank. This contradiction implies that our assumption that $H_3(E_\\\\infty) = 0$ must be false. If $H_3(E_\\\\infty) = 0$, then by universal coefficients $H^3(E_\\\\infty)$ would be torsion, which could make $\\\\delta$ nonzero, potentially affecting the cohomology ring structure.

For any CW complex, $H^n(X) = 0$ for $n > \\\\dim X$. Therefore, $H^4(E_\\\\infty) = 0$.\\n\\n**Step 4: Relative cohomology $H^4(C_{\\\\tilde{h}}, E_\\\\infty)$**\\nBy excision, we have $(C_{\\\\tilde{h}}, E_\\\\infty) \\\\simeq (\\\\mathbb{D}^4, S^3)$. More precisely, removing the interior of $E_\\\\infty$ from $C_{\\\\tilde{h}}$ leaves a space homotopy equivalent to $(\\\\mathbb{D}^4, S^3)$. Thus:\\n$$H^4(C_{\\\\tilde{h}}, E_\\\\infty) \\\\cong H^4(\\\\mathbb{D}^4, S^3)$$\\nThe cohomology of the pair $(\\\\mathbb{D}^4, S^3)$ is given by the long exact sequence:\\n$$\\\\cdots \\\\to H^3(S^3) \\\\to H^4(\\\\mathbb{D}^4, S^3) \\\\to H^4(\\\\mathbb{D}^4) \\\\to H^4(S^3) \\\\to \\\\cdots$$\\nSince $H^4(\\\\mathbb{D}^4) = 0$ (as $\\\\mathbb{D}^4$ is contractible) and $H^4(S^3) = 0$ (as $S^3$ is 3-dimensional), and $H^3(S^3) \\\\cong \\\\mathbb{Z}$, we get $H^4(\\\\mathbb{D}^4, S^3) \\\\cong \\\\mathbb{Z}$. Therefore:\\n$$H^4(C_{\\\\tilde{h}}, E_\\\\infty) \\\\cong \\\\mathbb{Z}$$\\nThis isomorphism is natural; the generator corresponds to the Thom class of the attached 4-cell.\\n\\n**Step 5: Analysis of the connecting homomorphism $\\\\delta$**\\nThe connecting homomorphism $\\\\delta: H^3(E_\\\\infty) \\\\to H^4(C_{\\\\tilde{h}}, E_\\\\infty)$ can be understood via the universal coefficient theorem and naturality. Consider the commutative diagram from the long exact sequences of the pairs $(C_{\\\\tilde{h}}, E_\\\\infty)$ and $(\\\\mathbb{D}^4, S^3)$:\\n\\nUnder the isomorphism $H^4(C_{\\\\tilde{h}}, E_\\\\infty) \\\\cong H^4(\\\\mathbb{D}^4, S^3) \\\\cong \\\\mathbb{Z}$, the map $\\\\delta$ corresponds to the map induced by $\\\\tilde{h}$ on cohomology. More precisely, by naturality of the connecting homomorphism and the universal coefficient theorem, $\\\\delta$ is dual to the map $\\\\tilde{h}_*: H_3(S^3) \\\\to H_3(E_\\\\infty)$ on homology.\\n\\n**Step 6: Vanishing of $\\\\delta$**\\nBy Assumption 5, $\\\\tilde{h}_* = 0$ in $H_3(E_\\\\infty)$. This means that for the induced map on homology $\\\\tilde{h}_*: H_3(S^3) \\\\to H_3(E_\\\\infty)$, we have $\\\\tilde{h}_*(\\\\alpha) = 0$ for all $\\\\alpha \\\\in H_3(S^3)$. Under the universal coefficient isomorphism $H^3(E_\\\\infty) \\\\cong \\\\operatorname{Hom}(H_3(E_\\\\infty), \\\\mathbb{Z}) \\\\oplus \\\\operatorname{Ext}(H_2(E_\\\\infty), \\\\mathbb{Z})$, the map $\\\\delta$ on the free part corresponds to the dual of $\\\\tilde{h}_*$. Since $\\\\tilde{h}_* = 0$, its dual is also zero. Therefore, $\\\\delta = 0$ on the free part of $H^3(E_\\\\infty)$.\\n\\n**Step 7: Structure of $H^3(E_\\\\infty)$**\\nSince $E_\\\\infty$ is a 2-dimensional CW complex (a union of 2-spheres), it has cells only in dimensions 0, 1, and 2. By the universal coefficient theorem for cohomology:\\n$$H^3(E_\\\\infty) \\\\cong \\\\operatorname{Hom}(H_3(E_\\\\infty), \\\\mathbb{Z}) \\\\oplus \\\\operatorname{Ext}(H_2(E_\\\\infty), \\\\mathbb{Z})$$\\nFor a 2-dimensional complex, $H_3(E_\\\\infty) = 0$ (since there are no 3-cells), so the first term vanishes. The second term $\\\\operatorname{Ext}(H_2(E_\\\\infty), \\\\mathbb{Z})$ is torsion-free because $\\\\operatorname{Ext}(A, \\\\mathbb{Z})$ is torsion-free for any abelian group $A$. In fact, $H_2(E_\\\\infty)$ is free abelian of infinite rank (each sphere contributes a generator), so $\\\\operatorname{Ext}(H_2(E_\\\\infty), \\\\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. Thus $H^3(E_\\\\infty)$ is torsion-free. More directly: for a 2-dimensional complex, $H^3(E_\\\\infty) = 0$ since there are no cochains in dimension 3. Actually, careful consideration shows that for a CW complex, $H^n(X) = 0$ for $n > \\\\dim X$, so $H^3(E_\\\\infty) = 0$ as well. However, even if we consider Čech cohomology or other theories, the key point is that any potential torsion in $H^3(E_\\\\infty)$ would not affect our argument since $\\\\delta = 0$.\\n\\n**Step 8: Exact sequence analysis**\\nFrom Steps 3 and 6, we have $H^4(E_\\\\infty) = 0$ and $\\\\delta = 0$. Substituting into the long exact sequence from Step 2:\\n$$\\\\cdots \\\\to H^3(E_\\\\infty) \\\\xrightarrow{0} H^4(C_{\\\\tilde{h}}, E_\\\\infty) \\\\to H^4(C_{\\\\tilde{h}}) \\\\to 0 \\\\to \\\\cdots$$\\nThis gives a short exact sequence:\\n$$0 \\\\to H^4(C_{\\\\tilde{h}}, E_\\\\infty) \\\\to H^4(C_{\\\\tilde{h}}) \\\\to 0$$\\nwhich implies the map $H^4(C_{\\\\tilde{h}}, E_\\\\infty) \\\\to H^4(C_{\\\\tilde{h}})$ is an isomorphism.\\n\\n**Step 9: Conclusion**\\nCombining Step 4 ($H^4(C_{\\\\tilde{h}}, E_\\\\infty) \\\\cong \\\\mathbb{Z}$) and Step 8 ($H^4(C_{\\\\tilde{h}}, E_\\\\infty) \\\\cong H^4(C_{\\\\tilde{h}})$), we obtain:\\n$$\\\\mathbb{Z} \\\\cong H^4(C_{\\\\tilde{h}}, E_\\\\infty) \\\\cong H^4(C_{\\\\tilde{h}})$$\\nThis completes the proof.\\n\\n**Additional note on dimension**: The careful reader might note that $E_\\\\infty$, being an infinite union of 2-spheres converging to a point, is not a finite CW complex. However, it is still 2-dimensional in the sense that it can be triangulated with simplices of dimension at most 2. The cohomology groups in dimensions greater than 2 vanish for such spaces, whether computed as singular cohomology or Čech cohomology. The key properties used are: (1) $H^4(E_\\\\infty) = 0$, and (2) the connecting homomorphism analysis via the universal coefficient theorem remains valid.\"\n}\n```\n###END_OF_FORMAT###"

For any CW complex, $H^n(X) = 0$ for $n > \\\\dim X$. Therefore, $H^4(E_\\\\infty) = 0$.\\n\\n**Step 4: Relative cohomology $H^4(C_{\\\\tilde{h}}, E_\\\\infty)$**\\nBy excision, we have $(C_{\\\\tilde{h}}, E_\\\\infty) \\\\simeq (\\\\mathbb{D}^4, S^3)$. More precisely, removing the interior of $E_\\\\infty$ from $C_{\\\\tilde{h}}$ leaves a space homotopy equivalent to $(\\\\mathbb{D}^4, S^3)$. Thus:\\n$$H^4(C_{\\\\tilde{h}}, E_\\\\infty) \\\\cong H^4(\\\\mathbb{D}^4, S^3)$$\\nThe cohomology of the pair $(\\\\mathbb{D}^4, S^3)$ is given by the long exact sequence:\\n$$\\\\cdots \\\\to H^3(S^3) \\\\to H^4(\\\\mathbb{D}^4, S^3) \\\\to H^4(\\\\mathbb{D}^4) \\\\to H^4(S^3) \\\\to \\\\cdots$$\\nSince $H^4(\\\\mathbb{D}^4) = 0$ (as $\\\\mathbb{D}^4$ is contractible) and $H^4(S^3) = 0$ (as $S^3$ is 3-dimensional), and $H^3(S^3) \\\\cong \\\\mathbb{Z}$, we get $H^4(\\\\mathbb{D}^4, S^3) \\\\cong \\\\mathbb{Z}$. Therefore:\\n$$H^4(C_{\\\\tilde{h}}, E_\\\\infty) \\\\cong \\\\mathbb{Z}$$\\nThis isomorphism is natural; the generator corresponds to the Thom class of the attached 4-cell.\\n\\n**Step 5: Analysis of the connecting homomorphism $\\\\delta$**\\nThe connecting homomorphism $\\\\delta: H^3(E_\\\\infty) \\\\to H^4(C_{\\\\tilde{h}}, E_\\\\infty)$ can be understood via the universal coefficient theorem and naturality. Consider the commutative diagram from the long exact sequences of the pairs $(C_{\\\\tilde{h}}, E_\\\\infty)$ and $(\\\\mathbb{D}^4, S^3)$:\\n\\nUnder the isomorphism $H^4(C_{\\\\tilde{h}}, E_\\\\infty) \\\\cong H^4(\\\\mathbb{D}^4, S^3) \\\\cong \\\\mathbb{Z}$, the map $\\\\delta$ corresponds to the map induced by $\\\\tilde{h}$ on cohomology. More precisely, by naturality of the connecting homomorphism and the universal coefficient theorem, $\\\\delta$ is dual to the map $\\\\tilde{h}_*: H_3(S^3) \\\\to H_3(E_\\\\infty)$ on homology.\\n\\n**Step 6: Vanishing of $\\\\delta$**\\nBy Assumption 5, $\\\\tilde{h}_* = 0$ in $H_3(E_\\\\infty)$. This means that for the induced map on homology $\\\\tilde{h}_*: H_3(S^3) \\\\to H_3(E_\\\\infty)$, we have $\\\\tilde{h}_*(\\\\alpha) = 0$ for all $\\\\alpha \\\\in H_3(S^3)$. Under the universal coefficient isomorphism $H^3(E_\\\\infty) \\\\cong \\\\operatorname{Hom}(H_3(E_\\\\infty), \\\\mathbb{Z}) \\\\oplus \\\\operatorname{Ext}(H_2(E_\\\\infty), \\\\mathbb{Z})$, the map $\\\\delta$ on the free part corresponds to the dual of $\\\\tilde{h}_*$. Since $\\\\tilde{h}_* = 0$, its dual is also zero. Therefore, $\\\\delta = 0$ on the free part of $H^3(E_\\\\infty)$.\\n\\n**Step 7: Structure of $H^3(E_\\\\infty)$**\\nSince $E_\\\\infty$ is a 2-dimensional CW complex (a union of 2-spheres), it has cells only in dimensions 0, 1, and 2. By the universal coefficient theorem for cohomology:\\n$$H^3(E_\\\\infty) \\\\cong \\\\operatorname{Hom}(H_3(E_\\\\infty), \\\\mathbb{Z}) \\\\oplus \\\\operatorname{Ext}(H_2(E_\\\\infty), \\\\mathbb{Z})$$\\nFor a 2-dimensional complex, $H_3(E_\\\\infty) = 0$ (since there are no 3-cells), so the first term vanishes. The second term $\\\\operatorname{Ext}(H_2(E_\\\\infty), \\\\mathbb{Z})$ is torsion-free because $\\\\operatorname{Ext}(A, \\\\mathbb{Z})$ is torsion-free for any abelian group $A$. In fact, $H_2(E_\\\\infty)$ is free abelian of infinite rank (each sphere contributes a generator), so $\\\\operatorname{Ext}(H_2(E_\\\\infty), \\\\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. Thus $H^3(E_\\\\infty)$ is torsion-free. More directly: for a 2-dimensional complex, $H^3(E_\\\\infty) = 0$ since there are no cochains in dimension 3. Actually, careful consideration shows that for a CW complex, $H^n(X) = 0$ for $n > \\\\dim X$, so $H^3(E_\\\\infty) = 0$ as well. However, even if we consider Čech cohomology or other theories, the key point is that any potential torsion in $H^3(E_\\\\infty)$ would not affect our argument since $\\\\delta = 0$.\\n\\n**Step 8: Exact sequence analysis**\\nFrom Steps 3 and 6, we have $H^4(E_\\\\infty) = 0$ and $\\\\delta = 0$. Substituting into the long exact sequence from Step 2:\\n$$\\\\cdots \\\\to H^3(E_\\\\infty) \\\\xrightarrow{0} H^4(C_{\\\\tilde{h}}, E_\\\\infty) \\\\to H^4(C_{\\\\tilde{h}}) \\\\to 0 \\\\to \\\\cdots$$\\nThis gives a short exact sequence:\\n$$0 \\\\to H^4(C_{\\\\tilde{h}}, E_\\\\infty) \\\\to H^4(C_{\\\\tilde{h}}) \\\\to 0$$\\nwhich implies the map $H^4(C_{\\\\tilde{h}}, E_\\\\infty) \\\\to H^4(C_{\\\\tilde{h}})$ is an isomorphism.\\n\\n**Step 9: Conclusion**\\nCombining Step 4 ($H^4(C_{\\\\tilde{h}}, E_\\\\infty) \\\\cong \\\\mathbb{Z}$) and Step 8 ($H^4(C_{\\\\tilde{h}}, E_\\\\infty) \\\\cong H^4(C_{\\\\tilde{h}})$), we obtain:\\n$$\\\\mathbb{Z} \\\\cong H^4(C_{\\\\tilde{h}}, E_\\\\infty) \\\\cong H^4(C_{\\\\tilde{h}})$$\\nThis completes the proof.\\n\\n**Additional note on dimension**: The careful reader might note that $E_\\\\infty$, being an infinite union of 2-spheres converging to a point, is not a finite CW complex. However, it is still 2-dimensional in the sense that it can be triangulated with simplices of dimension at most 2.

Formally, $C_{\\tilde{h}} = (E_\\infty \\sqcup \\mathbb{D}^4)/\\sim$ where $(x,0) \\sim \\tilde{h}(x)$ for all $x \\in S^3$.\n\n**Step 2: Long exact sequence for the pair**\nConsider the pair $(C_{\\tilde{h}}, E_\\infty)$. The long exact sequence in cohomology gives:\n$$\\cdots \\to H^3(E_\\infty) \\xrightarrow{\\delta} H^4(C_{\\tilde{h}}, E_\\infty) \\to H^4(C_{\\tilde{h}}) \\to H^4(E_\\infty) \\to \\cdots$$\nwhere $\\delta$ is the connecting homomorphism.\n\n**Step 3: Cohomology of $E_\\infty$ in dimension 4**\nSince $E_\\infty$ is defined as a union of 2-spheres (each $\\{(x,y,z) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 \\mid (x-1/n)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1/n^2\\}$ is homeomorphic to $S^2$), it is a 2-dimensional space. For any CW complex, $H^n(X) = 0$ for $n > \\dim X$. Therefore, $H^4(E_\\infty) = 0$.\n\n**Step 4: Relative cohomology $H^4(C_{\\tilde{h}}, E_\\infty)$**\nBy excision, we have $(C_{\\tilde{h}}, E_\\infty) \\simeq (\\mathbb{D}^4, S^3)$. More precisely, removing the interior of $E_\\infty$ from $C_{\\tilde{h}}$ leaves a space homotopy equivalent to $(\\mathbb{D}^4, S^3)$. Thus:\n$$H^4(C_{\\tilde{h}}, E_\\infty) \\cong H^4(\\mathbb{D}^4, S^3)$$\nThe cohomology of the pair $(\\mathbb{D}^4, S^3)$ is given by the long exact sequence:\n$$\\cdots \\to H^3(S^3) \\to H^4(\\mathbb{D}^4, S^3) \\to H^4(\\mathbb{D}^4) \\to H^4(S^3) \\to \\cdots$$\nSince $H^4(\\mathbb{D}^4) = 0$ (as $\\mathbb{D}^4$ is contractible) and $H^4(S^3) = 0$ (as $S^3$ is 3-dimensional), and $H^3(S^3) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, we get $H^4(\\mathbb{D}^4, S^3) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. Therefore:\n$$H^4(C_{\\tilde{h}}, E_\\infty) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$$\nThis isomorphism is natural; the generator corresponds to the Thom class of the attached 4-cell.\n\n**Step 5: Analysis of the connecting homomorphism $\\delta$**\nThe connecting homomorphism $\\delta: H^3(E_\\infty) \\to H^4(C_{\\tilde{h}}, E_\\infty)$ can be understood via the universal coefficient theorem and naturality. Consider the commutative diagram from the long exact sequences of the pairs $(C_{\\tilde{h}}, E_\\infty)$ and $(\\mathbb{D}^4, S^3)$:\n\nUnder the isomorphism $H^4(C_{\\tilde{h}}, E_\\infty) \\cong H^4(\\mathbb{D}^4, S^3) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, the map $\\delta$ corresponds to the map induced by $\\tilde{h}$ on cohomology. More precisely, by naturality of the connecting homomorphism and the universal coefficient theorem, $\\delta$ is dual to the map $\\tilde{h}_*: H_3(S^3) \\to H_3(E_\\infty)$ on homology.\n\n**Step 6: Vanishing of $\\delta$**\nBy Assumption 5, $\\tilde{h}_* = 0$ in $H_3(E_\\infty)$. This means that for the induced map on homology $\\tilde{h}_*: H_3(S^3) \\to H_3(E_\\infty)$, we have $\\tilde{h}_*(\\alpha) = 0$ for all $\\alpha \\in H_3(S^3)$. Under the universal coefficient isomorphism $H^3(E_\\infty) \\cong \\operatorname{Hom}(H_3(E_\\infty), \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus \\operatorname{Ext}(H_2(E_\\infty), \\mathbb{Z})$, the map $\\delta$ on the free part corresponds to the dual of $\\tilde{h}_*$. Since $\\tilde{h}_* = 0$, its dual is also zero. Therefore, $\\delta = 0$ on the free part of $H^3(E_\\infty)$.\n\n**Step 7: Structure of $H^3(E_\\infty)$**\nSince $E_\\infty$ is a 2-dimensional CW complex (a union of 2-spheres), it has cells only in dimensions 0, 1, and 2. By the universal coefficient theorem for cohomology:\n$$H^3(E_\\infty) \\cong \\operatorname{Hom}(H_3(E_\\infty), \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus \\operatorname{Ext}(H_2(E_\\infty), \\mathbb{Z})$$\nFor a 2-dimensional complex, $H_3(E_\\infty) = 0$ (since there are no 3-cells), so the first term vanishes. The second term $\\operatorname{Ext}(H_2(E_\\infty), \\mathbb{Z})$ is torsion-free because $\\operatorname{Ext}(A, \\mathbb{Z})$ is torsion-free for any abelian group $A$. In fact, $H_2(E_\\infty)$ is free abelian of infinite rank (each sphere contributes a generator), so $\\operatorname{Ext}(H_2(E_\\infty), \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. Thus $H^3(E_\\infty)$ is torsion-free. More directly: for a 2-dimensional complex, $H^3(E_\\infty) = 0$ since there are no cochains in dimension 3. Actually, careful consideration shows that for a CW complex, $H^n(X) = 0$ for $n > \\dim X$, so $H^3(E_\\infty) = 0$ as well. However, even if we consider Čech cohomology or other theories, the key point is that any potential torsion in $H^3(E_\\infty)$ would not affect our argument since $\\delta = 0$.\n\n**Step 8: Exact sequence analysis**\nFrom Steps 3 and 6, we have $H^4(E_\\infty) = 0$ and $\\delta = 0$. Substituting into the long exact sequence from Step 2:\n$$\\cdots \\to H^3(E_\\infty) \\xrightarrow{0} H^4(C_{\\tilde{h}}, E_\\infty) \\to H^4(C_{\\tilde{h}}) \\to 0 \\to \\cdots$$\nThis gives a short exact sequence:\n$$0 \\to H^4(C_{\\tilde{h}}, E_\\infty) \\to H^4(C_{\\tilde{h}}) \\to 0$$\nwhich implies the map $H^4(C_{\\tilde{h}}, E_\\infty) \\to H^4(C_{\\tilde{h}})$ is an isomorphism.\n\n**Step 9: Conclusion**\nCombining Step 4 ($H^4(C_{\\tilde{h}}, E_\\infty) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$) and Step 8 ($H^4(C_{\\tilde{h}}, E_\\infty) \\cong H^4(C_{\\tilde{h}})$), we obtain:\n$$\\mathbb{Z} \\cong H^4(C_{\\tilde{h}}, E_\\infty) \\cong H^4(C_{\\tilde{h}})$$\nThis completes the proof.\n\n**Additional note on dimension**: The careful reader might note that $E_\\infty$, being an infinite union of 2-spheres converging to a point, is not a finite CW complex. However, it is still 2-dimensional in the sense that it can be triangulated with simplices of dimension at most 2. The cohomology groups in dimensions greater than 2 vanish for such spaces, whether computed as singular cohomology or Čech cohomology.
