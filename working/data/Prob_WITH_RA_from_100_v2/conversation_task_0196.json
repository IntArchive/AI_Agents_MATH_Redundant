Then every column of $A$ is a scalar multiple of $v$ (specifically, the $j$-th column is $w_j v$). Similarly, every row of $A$ is a scalar multiple of $w^T$. Thus, the column space of $A$ is spanned by $v$, and the row space is spanned by $w^T$. Since $v \\neq 0$ and $w \\neq 0$, $\\operatorname{rank}(A) = 1$.\n\n($\\Rightarrow$) Now assume $\\operatorname{rank}(A) = 1$. Since the rank is 1, the column space of $A$ is 1-dimensional. Let $v$ be a nonzero vector that spans the column space. Then every column of $A$ can be written as a scalar multiple of $v$. Let the $j$-th column be $w_j v$ for some scalar $w_j$. Define $w = (w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_m)^T \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$. Then $A = vw^T$.\n\nSince $\\operatorname{rank}(A) = 1$, $A \\neq 0$, so $v \\neq 0$ and $w \\neq 0$ (otherwise $A$ would be the zero matrix, which has rank 0).\n\nThus, we have shown both directions of the equivalence.
