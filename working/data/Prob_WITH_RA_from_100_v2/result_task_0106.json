    "AcceptedAnswer":"Torsten Carleman $[2]$ proved in 1922 that $$\n\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\left(a_1a_2\\cdots a_n\\right)^{1\/n} < e\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n,\n$$ where $a_n \\geq 0$, $n=1,2,\\dots$, and $0 < \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n < \\infty$. Thenceforth, this result is known as Carleman's inequality . There exists a number of refined versions of Carleman's original work $[3, 6]$. It has turned out that the following generalization is – from our point of view – important, which is proved by Yang $[7]$:\n$$\n\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\left(a_1a_2\\cdots a_n\\right)^{1\/n} < e\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\left(1-\\sum_{k=1}^6 \\frac{b_k}{(n+1)^k}\\right)a_n,\n$$ with $b_1 = 1\/2, b_2 = 1\/24, b_3 = 1\/48, b_4 = 73\/5670, b_5 = 11\/1280, b_6 = 1945\/580608$.\nOn the last page of his paper, Yang $[7]$ conjectured that if\n$$\n\\left(1+\\frac{1}{x}\\right)^x = e\\left(1-\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{b_n}{(x+1)^n}\\right), \\quad x>0,\n$$ then $b_n > 0$, $n=1,2,\\dots.$ In fact, the constants $b_4$ and $b_6$ are not corrent in Yang's work, the correct values are $b_4 = 73\/5760$ and $b_6 = 3625\/580608$. Later, this conjecture was proved and discussed by Yang $[8]$, Gylletberg and Ping $[4]$, and Yue $[9]$. They are using the recurrence\n$$\nb_1 = \\frac12, \\quad b_n = \\frac{1}{n}\\left(\\frac{1}{n+1} - \\sum_{k=0}^{n-2} \\frac{b_{n-k-1}}{k+2} \\right), \\quad n = 2,3,\\dots.\n$$\nThe recurrence is given in a somewhat more compact form in Finch's manuscript $[3]$, as the following: $$\nb_0 = -1, \\quad b_n = -\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{b_{n-k}}{k+1}, \\quad n = 1,2,\\dots.\n$$ The first ten values of the sequence are listed in the next table.\n\\begin{array} {|r|r|}\n\\hline\nb_0 & -1 \\\\ \\hline b_1 & 1\/2 \\\\ \\hline b_2 & 1\/24 \\\\ \\hline b_3 & 1\/48 \\\\ \\hline b_4 & 73\/5760 \\\\ \\hline b_5 & 11\/1280 \\\\ \\hline b_6 & 3625\/580608 \\\\ \\hline b_7 & 5525\/1161216 \\\\ \\hline b_8 & 5233001\/1393459200 \\\\ \\hline b_9 & 1212281\/398131200 \\\\ \\hline b_{10} & 927777937\/367873228800 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\nThe numerators are recorded as A249276 , and the denominators as A249277 in the OEIS . I've calculated the $b_n$ sequence in the range $n=0,\\dots,32$, the elements are listed here . The following theorem is proved in general in the paper by Hu and Mortici $[5]$, and for the special cases $n=0$ and $n=1$ in the paper by Alzer and Berg $[1]$. For all integer $n \\geq 0$, we have $$\n\\int_0^1 x^n\\sin\\left(\\pi x\\right)x^x\\left(1-x\\right)^{1-x}\\,dx = b_{n+2}\\pi e.\n$$ The special case $n=0$ answers my question. References H.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, so I need to format the problem from Math Stack Exchange according to the given example. Let me first read through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe title is: \"Prove that ∫₀¹ sin(πx) xˣ (1−x)¹⁻ˣ dx = πe\/24\". The user mentions they found this integral somewhere and haven't seen it before. They want to verify it and ask for a reference if it's well-known.\n\nThe task is to structure this problem into the specified format. The example given had assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the original problem, the integral is from 0 to 1 of sin(πx) times x^x times (1−x)^{1−x} dx, and the result is supposed to be πe\/24. The user transformed the original integral by substituting x with 1−x, leading to sin(π(1−x)) which becomes sin(πx) because sin(π - πx) = sin(πx). So both forms of the integral are equal.\n\nBut in terms of assumptions, what needs to be listed here? The problem is to prove the integral equals πe\/24. The integrand is sin(πx) multiplied by x^x (1−x)^{1−x}. The limits of integration are from 0 to 1. Are there any implicit assumptions here?\n\nThe variables are x, which is integrated over [0,1]. The functions involved are sin(πx), which is continuous on [0,1], and x^x (1−x)^{1−x}, which is also defined on (0,1) and can be extended continuously to 0 and 1 since x^x approaches 1 as x approaches 0 from the right, and similarly (1−x)^{1−x} approaches 1 as x approaches 1 from the left. So the integrand is continuous on [0,1], hence the integral is proper and exists. But maybe the problem doesn't require stating these as assumptions because they are part of the integral definition. The user isn't adding any extra conditions; they just want to prove the integral equals that value. \n\nIn the example given, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But here, the integral is definite, over [0,1], with the integrand as specified. So perhaps there are no additional assumptions beyond the integral's structure. However, the problem might involve some properties or conditions, but the user hasn't specified any. Wait, in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer, but in the formatted problem, they listed assumptions as n is integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem was to prove for every integer n, the number is divisible by 91. The user in that case had perhaps a mistake, but the assistant included n is divisible by 7 as an assumption. Wait, maybe the example was edited. Let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal problem in example: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. Formatted problem's assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so perhaps the formatted assumption mistakenly added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems conflicting. Maybe the example was a mistake, but the user wants to follow the structure regardless. So in this problem, perhaps there are no specific assumptions besides the integral being as stated. However, the integral involves the functions x^x and (1−x)^{1−x}, which might have properties that are assumed, like being defined on [0,1], but perhaps those are considered part of the problem statement rather than assumptions. So maybe in this case, the assumptions section would be empty or not applicable. But according to the format, we need to list assumptions.\n\nWait, looking at the example, even though the original problem says \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, and then added \"n is divisible by 7\", which was not in the original. So perhaps in the example, there was a mistake, but the user wants to extract assumptions. Wait, maybe the example was not accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem had some hidden assumptions. Wait, maybe in the example, the original problem might have had a typo, and the formatted version corrected it. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the example. But regardless, the task is to apply the format to the new problem.\n\nSo for the current problem: the integral is from 0 to 1, integrand is sin(πx) x^x (1−x)^{1−x}. The problem is to prove that this integral equals πe\/24. The user also mentions that they transformed the integral using substitution x → 1−x and noticed that sin(π(1−x)) = sin(πx), so the integral remains the same. But that's part of the problem's context.\n\nIn terms of assumptions, what's needed here? Since the problem is to compute the definite integral, perhaps the assumptions are related to the functions involved. For example:\n\n- The integral is taken over the interval [0, 1].\n- The function x^x (1−x)^{1−x} is defined on [0,1].\n- sin(πx) is continuous on [0,1].\n\nBut maybe these are too obvious. However, according to the example, even obvious assumptions were listed, like \"n is an integer\". So perhaps in this case, the assumptions would include:\n\n- The integral is evaluated over the interval [0, 1].\n- The integrand is sin(πx) multiplied by x^x multiplied by (1−x)^{1−x}.\n- The functions x^x and (1−x)^{1−x} are defined as their continuous extensions on [0,1].\n\nBut the example's assumptions were more about the variables involved. Here, the integral is definite, so the variable x is integrated out. The main object here is the integral itself. The problem is to compute it. So perhaps the assumptions are about the integral's components. Alternatively, maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond the problem statement. But according to the user's example, even if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", they list \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So perhaps here, the assumptions would include:\n\n- x is a real variable in the interval [0, 1].\n- The integrand is composed of sin(πx), x^x, and (1−x)^{1−x}.\n\nBut maybe the key is to list each assumption line by line. Let me try:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is over the interval [0, 1].\nThe integrand is the product of sin(πx), x^x, and (1−x)^{1−x}.\nx^x is defined as its continuous extension at x=0.\n(1−x)^{1−x} is defined as its continuous extension at x=1.\n\nBut perhaps the last two are part of the problem's definition. Alternatively, maybe those aren't necessary. The problem states the integral as ∫₀¹ sin(πx) x^x (1−x)^{1−x} dx, so implicitly assuming the integrand is defined there. So maybe the only assumption needed is the integral's structure. However, following the example, which listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", maybe in this case, the assumption is just the integral's structure. But the example included two assumptions for the same object, n. So perhaps here, each part of the integrand is an assumption. Wait, but each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no specific assumptions here beyond the problem's given, so the assumptions section could be empty, but the format requires it. The example shows that even if the problem is stated generally, assumptions are listed. Perhaps in this case, the only assumption is that the integral is in the given form. But how to break that down into line items?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem doesn't have explicit assumptions beyond the integral's definition, so the assumptions section would list:\n\n- The integral is from 0 to 1.\n- The integrand is sin(πx) multiplied by x^x multiplied by (1−x)^{1−x}.\n\nBut these are two separate lines. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated from 0 to 1,\nThe integrand is the product of sin(πx), x^x, and (1−x)^{1−x}.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$\\int_{0}^{1}\\sin{(\\pi x)}x^x(1-x)^{1-x}\\,dx =\\frac{\\pi e}{24}.$$\n\nThat seems to align with the example's structure. The example took the original problem, which had an integral and a result, and formatted it by listing assumptions. However, in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer, which was listed, and then added another assumption (n divisible by 7) which wasn't in the original. So maybe the user made a mistake in the example. But regardless, for the current problem, perhaps the assumptions are the interval of integration and the composition of the integrand. Each on a separate line.",
