        "mathematician and proof writer": "Assumption:\nAssumption 1: $$\\cos(150\\times 89^\\circ)=\\cos(37\\times 360^\\circ+30^\\circ)=\\cos(30^\\circ)$$\nProblem:\nProve that The angle $1^\\circ$ is considered in standard trigonometric terms.\nWe will prove that sin(1°) is irrational using the given assumption that cos(150×89°) = cos(30°) = √3/2, trigonometric identities, properties of Chebyshev polynomials, and a proof by contradiction.\n\n1. **Given Assumption**: We are given that cos(150×89°) = cos(37×360°+30°) = cos(30°). Since cos(30°) = √3/2, we have:\n   $$\\cos(150\\times 89^\\circ) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}.$$\n   Note that √3/2 is an irrational number (since √3 is irrational and division by 2 preserves irrationality).\n\n2. **Cofunction Identity**: Observe that 89° = 90° - 1°. Using the cofunction identity cos(90° - θ) = sin(θ), we obtain:\n   $$\\cos(89^\\circ) = \\cos(90^\\circ - 1^\\circ) = \\sin(1^\\circ).$$\n\n3. **Chebyshev Polynomial Property**: For any integer n ≥ 0, the Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind T_n(x) satisfies the identity:\n   $$\\cos(n\\theta) = T_n(\\cos\\theta).$$\n   Moreover, T_n(x) is a polynomial with integer coefficients. In particular, for n = 150, we have:\n   $$\\cos(150\\theta) = T_{150}(\\cos\\theta).$$\n\n4. **Applying the Chebyshev Identity**: Set θ = 89°. Then:\n   $$\\cos(150\\times 89^\\circ) = T_{150}(\\cos 89^\\circ).$$\n   Using step 2, cos(89°) = sin(1°), so:\n   $$\\cos(150\\times 89^\\circ) = T_{150}(\\sin 1^\\circ).$$\n\n5. **Assume for Contradiction**: Suppose, contrary to what we want to prove, that sin(1°) is rational. Write it in lowest terms as:\n   $$\\sin(1^\\circ) = \\frac{p}{q},$$\n   where p and q are integers, q ≠ 0, and gcd(p, q) = 1.\n\n6. **Rationality of T_{150}(p/q)**: Since T_{150}(x) is a polynomial with integer coefficients, say:\n   $$T_{150}(x) = a_{150}x^{150} + a_{149}x^{149} + \\cdots + a_1 x + a_0,$$\n   with each a_i ∈ ℤ, then:\n   $$T_{150}\\left(\\frac{p}{q}\\right) = a_{150}\\left(\\frac{p}{q}\\right)^{150} + a_{149}\\left(\\frac{p}{q}\\right)^{149} + \\cdots + a_1\\left(\\frac{p}{q}\\right) + a_0.$$\n   Multiplying by q^{150} gives an integer numerator and denominator q^{150}, so T_{150}(p/q) is a rational number.\n\n7. **Contradiction**: From steps 1 and 4, we have:\n   $$T_{150}(\\sin 1^\\circ) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}.$$\n   If sin(1°) were rational p/q, then T_{150}(p/q) would be rational. However, √3/2 is irrational. This is a contradiction.\n\n8. **Conclusion on sin(1°)**: Therefore, our assumption that sin(1°) is rational must be false. Hence, sin(1°) is irrational.\n\n9. **Significance for 1°**: The irrationality of sin(1°) is a nontrivial trigonometric property. It implies, for instance, that 1° is not a constructible angle with compass and straightedge (since constructible angles have sines that are algebraic numbers of degree a power of 2, but sin(1°) is algebraic of degree much higher). Moreover, the fact that we can establish such a property using standard trigonometric identities and polynomial algebra demonstrates that 1° is a legitimate subject of trigonometric analysis.\n\n10. **Final Statement**: Thus, 1° is indeed considered in standard trigonometric terms, as it possesses well‑defined trigonometric values (like sin(1°)) that exhibit interesting mathematical properties, such as irrationality, which can be rigorously proved using classical trigonometric and algebraic methods.\n\nThis completes the proof.",
