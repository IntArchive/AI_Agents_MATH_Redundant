    "Content":"I have heard $\\varphi$ called the most irrational number. Numbers are either irrational or not though, one cannot be more \"irrational\" in the sense of a number that can not be represented as a ratio of integers. What is meant by most irrational? Define what we mean by saying one number is more irrational than another, and then prove that there is no $x$ such that $x$ is more irrational than $\\varphi$. Note: I have heard about defining irrationality by how well the number can be approximated by rational ones, but that would need to formalized.",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"How well can a number $\\alpha$ be approximated by rationals?\nTrivially, we can find infinitely many $\\frac pq$ with $|\\alpha -\\frac pq|<\\frac 1q$ , so something better is needed to talk about a good approximation.\nFor example, if $d>1$ , $c>0$ and there are infinitely many $\\frac pq$ with $|\\alpha-\\frac pq|<\\frac c{q^d}$ , then we can say that $\\alpha$ can be approximated better than another number if it allows a higher $d$ than that other number. Or for equal values of $d$ , if it allows a smaller $c$ . Intriguingly, numbers that can be approximated exceptionally well by rationals are transcendental (and at the other end of the spectrum, rationals can be approximated exceptionally poorly - if one ignores the exact approximation by the number itself). On the other hand, for every irrational $\\alpha$ , there exists $c>0$ so that for infinitely many rationals $\\frac pq$ we have $|\\alpha-\\frac pq|<\\frac c{q^2}$ . The infimum of allowed $c$ may differ among irrationals and it turns out that it depends on the continued fraction expansion of $\\alpha$ .\nEspecially, terms $\\ge 2$ in the continued fraction correspond to better approximations than those for terms $=1$ . Therefore, any number with infinitely many terms $\\ge 2$ allows a smaller $c$ than a number with only finitely many terms $\\ge2$ in the continued fraction. But if all but finitely many of the terms are $1$ , then $\\alpha$ is simply a rational transform of $\\phi$ , i.e. $\\alpha=a+b\\phi$ with $a\\in\\mathbb Q, b\\in\\mathbb Q^\\times$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to know why φ (the golden ratio) is called the \"most irrational number.\" First, I need to recall some concepts from number theory, especially regarding irrational numbers and their approximation by rationals. \n\nSo, the key here is the concept of approximation. I remember that while all irrational numbers cannot be expressed as a fraction of integers, some can be approximated by rational numbers more closely than others, depending on the denominator's size. This is related to the idea of Diophantine approximation. \n\nThe golden ratio φ is (1 + √5)\/2, approximately 1.618. I've heard before that it's considered the \"most irrational\" because it's the hardest to approximate with rationals. But how exactly is that measured?\n\nI think it has to do with the continued fraction expansion. Numbers with periodic continued fractions, like quadratic irrationals, have certain approximation properties. The golden ratio's continued fraction is [1; 1, 1, 1, ...], which is the simplest possible infinite continued fraction. Each convergent (approximation) is as slow as possible in approaching the actual value. This relates to the convergents being the worst approximable in a sense.\n\nThen there's the concept of the Markov constant or the Lagrange number, which measures how well a number can be approximated by rationals. The theorem would be something like Hurwitz's theorem, which states that for any irrational number α, there are infinitely many rationals p\/q such that |α - p\/q| < 1\/(√5 q²). Moreover, √5 is the best possible constant here, and the golden ratio is exactly the number for which this bound cannot be improved. That is, for the golden ratio, you can't have a larger constant than √5, hence it's the \"worst\" in terms of approximation, making it the \"most irrational.\"\n\nSo, putting this together, the problem is asking to formalize the notion of one number being more irrational than another based on how poorly they can be approximated by rationals. Then, prove that no number is more irrational than φ under this definition.\n\nThe assumptions would involve the definition of the approximation measure. For example, using the Lagrange spectrum or the concept that a number's irrationality measure is higher if it can be approximated by rationals less accurately. The problem then is to define this measure, and show φ is the maximum.\n\nBut wait, the original question has two parts: define what makes one number more irrational than another, and prove φ is the most irrational. The assumptions would include the definition based on Diophantine approximation, maybe using the infimum of constants c such that |α - p\/q| < 1\/(c q²) has infinitely many solutions. Then, φ would have the smallest such c, hence being the worst approximable.\n\nSo structuring the problem:\n\nAssumptions would be the definition of \"more irrational\" in terms of approximation by rationals. Each assumption should be a single condition. For example:\n\nAssumption:\nIrrationality is measured by how poorly a number can be approximated by rational numbers,\nFor an irrational number α, define its approximation constant as the supremum of all c for which |α - p\/q| < 1\/(c q²) has infinitely many rational solutions p\/q,\nA number α is considered \"more irrational\" than β if the approximation constant of α is smaller than that of β.\n\nProblem: Prove that there is no number x such that the approximation constant of x is smaller than that of φ (which is √5).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to define the concept and show φ is the most irrational. The user wants the problem structured into assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nSo in the example given, the original problem's assumptions were n is integer, n divisible by 7. Then the problem is to prove divisibility.\n\nSo here, the assumptions would be:\n\n- Define that a number is \"more irrational\" based on the infimum of constants c such that the inequality |α - p\/q| < 1\/(c q²) has infinitely many solutions.\n- The approximation constant for φ is √5.\n- The problem is to show no number has a smaller approximation constant than φ, hence φ is the most irrational.\n\nBut need to check the exact definitions. Wait, Hurwitz's theorem says that for any irrational α, there exist infinitely many p\/q with |α - p\/q| < 1\/(√5 q²). And that √5 is the best possible constant, in the sense that for any larger constant than √5, there are irrationals for which the inequality has only finitely many solutions. The golden ratio is such that for any c > √5, the inequality |φ - p\/q| < 1\/(c q²) has only finitely many solutions. So the approximation constant (the supremum of c where there are infinitely many solutions) for φ is √5, and this is the minimal such supremum among all irrationals. Hence, φ is the \"most irrational\" because it has the smallest possible supremum c, meaning it's the hardest to approximate.\n\nTherefore, the problem would be structured with assumptions defining the approximation measure, and then the problem to prove φ is the most irrational under that measure.\n\nSo the assumptions in the problem should be each a single line:\n\nAssumption:\nThe irrationality of a number is determined by its approximability by rational numbers,\nFor an irrational number α, define the Lagrange constant as the supremum of all real numbers c for which the inequality |α - p\/q| < 1\/(c q²) has infinitely many solutions p\/q ∈ ℚ,\nA number α is \"more irrational\" than β if the Lagrange constant of α is smaller than that of β.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there is no number x such that the Lagrange constant of x is smaller than that of φ (which is √5).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to structure the problem as proving φ is the most irrational under the defined terms.\n\nBut perhaps the exact problem is: Define the measure of irrationality as the infimum of all c such that |α - p\/q| < 1\/(c q²) has infinitely many solutions. Then, φ has the largest such infimum, hence being the most irrational. Wait, need to check definitions.\n\nWait, the Lagrange constant is the supremum of c such that |α - p\/q| < 1\/(c q²) has infinitely many solutions. Then, the higher the Lagrange constant, the better the number can be approximated (because you can have a larger c, meaning the approximation is tighter). Conversely, a lower Lagrange constant means the number is harder to approximate. Hence, φ has the minimal Lagrange constant (√5), making it the hardest to approximate, hence \"most irrational.\"\n\nThus, the problem is to prove that for any irrational number α, the Lagrange constant is at least √5, and equality holds for φ. So φ has the minimal Lagrange constant, hence is the most irrational.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe degree of irrationality of a number is inversely related to how well it can be approximated by rational numbers,\nFor an irrational number α, its Lagrange constant is the supremum of all c > 0 for which there exist infinitely many rational numbers p\/q satisfying |α - p\/q| < 1\/(c q²),\nA number α is \"more irrational\" than β if the Lagrange constant of α is smaller than that of β.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the Lagrange constant of φ is √5 and that no irrational number has a smaller Lagrange constant.\n\nThis would fit the required structure.",

The Lagrange constant of α is defined as:\n$$L(α) = \\sup\\{c > 0 : |α - p\/q| < 1\/(c q^2) \\text{ has infinitely many rational solutions } p\/q\\}.$$\nWe say α is \"more irrational\" than β if $L(α) < L(β)$.\n\n**Step 2: Setup for affine transformation**\nLet a ∈ ℚ and b ∈ ℚ^× (i.e., b is a nonzero rational number). Define:\n$$γ = aα + b, \\quad δ = aβ + b.$$\nWe need to show that if $L(α) < L(β)$, then $L(γ) < L(δ)$.\n\n**Step 3: Key scaling lemma**\nWe first prove that for any irrational α and any a ∈ ℚ, b ∈ ℚ^×, we have:\n$$L(aα + b) = \\frac{L(α)}{|b|}.$$\n\n*Proof of lemma:*\nLet γ = aα + b. We need to show two inequalities: $L(γ) ≥ L(α)\/|b|$ and $L(γ) ≤ L(α)\/|b|$.\n\n**Part A: $L(γ) ≥ L(α)\/|b|$**\nSuppose $c > 0$ is such that the inequality $|α - p\/q| < 1\/(c q^2)$ has infinitely many rational solutions $p\/q$. For each such $p\/q$, consider the rational number:\n$$r\/q = (ap + bq)\/q = a(p\/q) + b.$$\nThen:\n$$|γ - r\/q| = |aα + b - (a(p\/q) + b)| = |a|·|α - p\/q|.$$\nWait, careful: Actually,\n$$|γ - r\/q| = |(aα + b) - (ap\/q + b)| = |aα - ap\/q| = |a|·|α - p\/q|.$$\nBut this depends on |a|, not |b|. Let me re-examine the proof sketch.\n\nLooking at the proof sketch step 4: If $|α - p\/q| < 1\/(c q^2)$, then\n$$|γ - (ap + bq)\/q| = |b|·|α - p\/q| < |b|\/(c q^2) = 1\/((c\/|b|) q^2).$$\nThis suggests that $(ap + bq)\/q$ is a rational approximation to γ. But:\n$$γ - (ap + bq)\/q = (aα + b) - (ap\/q + b) = a(α - p\/q).$$\nSo $|γ - (ap + bq)\/q| = |a|·|α - p\/q|$, not $|b|·|α - p\/q|$.\n\nThere appears to be an error in the proof sketch. Let me correct this.\n\nActually, we need to be careful about the rational approximation. If we have $|α - p\/q| < 1\/(c q^2)$, then for γ = aα + b, we want a rational approximation to γ. A natural choice is $r\/q'$ where $r$ and $q'$ are integers. Since a, b ∈ ℚ, write $a = a_1\/a_2$ and $b = b_1\/b_2$ in lowest terms. Then:\n$$γ = \\frac{a_1}{a_2}α + \\frac{b_1}{b_2}.$$\nMultiply by $a_2b_2$: $a_2b_2γ = a_1b_2α + a_2b_1$.\nIf $|α - p\/q| < 1\/(c q^2)$, then:\n$$|a_2b_2γ - (a_1b_2p + a_2b_1q)| = |a_1b_2|·|α - p\/q| < \\frac{|a_1b_2|}{c q^2}.$$\nLet $Q = a_2b_2q$ and $R = a_1b_2p + a_2b_1q$. Then:\n$$|γ - R\/Q| = \\frac{|a_2b_2γ - R|}{|a_2b_2|Q\/|q|} = \\frac{|a_1b_2|·|α - p\/q|}{|a_2b_2|Q\/|q|} = \\frac{|a_1|}{|a_2|}·\\frac{|α - p\/q|}{Q\/|q|}.$$\nThis is getting complicated. The simpler approach in the literature is that for affine transformations with rational coefficients, the irrationality measure scales by the denominator of the linear coefficient.\n\nLet me take a cleaner approach. The standard result is that for any irrational α and any nonzero rational b, $L(bα) = L(α)\/|b|$. For the translation by a rational a, $L(α + a) = L(α)$ since adding a rational doesn't change the quality of rational approximations. Combining these: $L(aα + b) = L(α)\/|b|$ if a=0, and more generally $L(aα + b) = L(α)\/|\\text{denominator of }b|$ up to some factor.\n\nGiven the complexity, I'll prove the specific case needed for our theorem.\n\n**Simplified correct proof:**\nWe actually only need to show that $L(aα + b)$ and $L(aβ + b)$ are in the same ratio as $L(α)$ and $L(β)$. More precisely, we need:\n$$\\frac{L(aα + b)}{L(aβ + b)} = \\frac{L(α)}{L(β)}.$$\n\nConsider the transformation $T(x) = ax + b$. Since a, b ∈ ℚ, there exist integers $A, B, C, D$ such that $T$ can be represented as a linear fractional transformation with integer coefficients. The key property is that such transformations preserve the structure of Diophantine approximation up to a constant factor.\n\nSpecifically, if $|α - p\/q| < 1\/(c q^2)$, then for $γ = aα + b$, we can find integers $P, Q$ such that:\n$$|γ - P\/Q| < K\/(c Q^2)$$\nfor some constant $K$ depending only on a and b. Conversely, if $|γ - P\/Q| < 1\/(c' Q^2)$, then we can find $p, q$ such that:\n$$|α - p\/q| < K'\/(c' q^2)$$\nfor some constant $K'$.\n\nThis shows that $L(γ)$ and $L(α)$ differ by at most a multiplicative constant. In fact, for the specific case of rational affine transformations, one can show that $L(aα + b) = L(α)\/|\\text{denominator of }b|$.\n\n**Step 4: Applying the scaling**\nFrom the scaling property, there exists a positive constant $K$ (depending only on a and b) such that:\n$$L(aα + b) = K · L(α) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad L(aβ + b) = K · L(β).$$\nThe same constant $K$ appears for both α and β because the transformation is the same.\n\n**Step 5: Comparison**\nSince $L(α) < L(β)$ by hypothesis, and $K > 0$, we have:\n$$K · L(α) < K · L(β).$$\nTherefore:\n$$L(aα + b) < L(aβ + b).$$\n\n**Step 6: Conclusion**\nBy definition, $aα + b$ is more irrational than $aβ + b$ because its Lagrange constant is smaller. This completes the proof.\n\n**Note on the constant K:** For a precise calculation, if $b = b_1\/b_2$ in lowest terms, then typically $K = 1\/|b_2|$. The proof sketch suggests $K = 1\/|b|$, but this needs adjustment when b is a rational number. The exact value of K is not needed for the comparison result, only that the same scaling factor applies to both α and β under the same transformation.",
