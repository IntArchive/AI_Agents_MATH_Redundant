    "Content":"If I want to prove that the function $\\ f(x)=\\sin(x^2)$ is not uniformly continuous on the domain $\\mathbb{R}$ , I need to show that: $\\exists\\varepsilon>0$ $\\forall\\delta>0$ $\\exists{x,y}\\in\\mathbb{R}\\ : |x-y|<\\delta$ and $|\\sin(x^2) - \\sin(y^2)|\\geq\\varepsilon$ . So let's take $\\varepsilon = 1$ . Then I want $|\\sin(x^2)-\\sin(y^2)|\\ge1$ . That's the case if $\\sin(x^2)=0$ and $\\sin(y^2)=\\pm1$ . Thus $x^2=n\\pi$ and $y^2=n\\pi + \\frac{1}{2}\\pi$ . Now I'm stuck on expressing x and y, which I want to express in $\\delta$ , to ensure that $|x-y|<\\delta$ . Thanks in advance for any help.",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"You have chosen $x^2=n\\pi$ and $y^2 = n\\pi+\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, so you can take $x=\\sqrt{n \\pi}$ and $y=\\sqrt{n \\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{2}}$. Then, $|x-y|=\\sqrt{n \\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{2}}-\\sqrt{n \\pi}=\\frac{n\\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{2}-n\\pi}{\\sqrt{n \\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{2}}+\\sqrt{n \\pi}}=\\frac{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}{\\sqrt{n \\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{2}}+\\sqrt{n \\pi}}<\\frac{2}{2\\sqrt{n \\pi}}<\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}$ If $n > \\frac{1}{\\delta^2}$ then $|x-y|<\\delta$ but $|f(x)-f(y)|\\geq 1$. The values $x,y$ are very close but $f(x)$ and $f(y)$ are far apart.\nIntuitively, for $\\epsilon = 1$ there is no $\\delta$ that allows you to know $f(x)$ within precision $\\epsilon$ if you know $x$ within precision $\\delta$. The oscillations in $\\sin(x^2)$ get faster and faster, on arbitrarily small intervals the function changes its value from 0 to 1. Note that if you change the function to $\\sin x$ the proof will fail, because taking $x=n\\pi$ and $y=n\\pi+\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ does not make $|x-y|<\\delta$ for small $\\delta$ (indeed, $y-x$ is constant). In fact, $\\sin x$ is uniformly continuous.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. The example provided shows that I need to extract assumptions and the problem statement, breaking down each assumption into one line per property or condition applied to a single object.\n\nFirst, I need to read the original problem carefully. The question is about proving that the function f(x) = sin(x²) is not uniformly continuous on ℝ. The user has already started working on it and is stuck on expressing x and y in terms of δ. \n\nLooking at the assumptions: The key points here are the function in question, its domain, and the conditions for uniform continuity. The problem requires showing that there exists an ε > 0 such that for every δ > 0, there exist points x and y within δ distance but with the function values differing by at least ε. The user chose ε = 1 and considered cases where sin(x²) is 0 and sin(y²) is ±1. They set x² = nπ and y² = nπ + π\/2, leading to x = sqrt(nπ) and y = sqrt(nπ + π\/2). The challenge is expressing x and y such that |x - y| < δ.\n\nNow, to structure this into the required format. The assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. The function is defined as sin(x²), the domain is ℝ, the goal is to show it's not uniformly continuous, which involves the existence of ε, for all δ, existence of x and y with specific properties. However, the user's approach already sets ε to 1 and defines x and y based on nπ. So perhaps the assumptions include the function definition, domain, and the criteria for non-uniform continuity.\n\nWait, in the example given, the assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So in this problem, the assumptions would be things like \"f(x) = sin(x²)\", \"the domain of f is ℝ\", \"the problem requires proving f is not uniformly continuous on ℝ\". But according to the example, assumptions are more about conditions given in the problem. The original problem here is to prove non-uniform continuity, so the assumptions would be the properties of the function and the domain. However, the user's attempt introduces specific choices for ε, x, and y. But in the example, the assumptions were about the variable n. So maybe in this case, the assumptions are the function's definition and domain. However, the problem is to prove non-uniform continuity, which is the main statement. The user's approach is part of their attempt, not the problem's assumptions.\n\nSo, the Problem section should be the original statement to prove, and the Assumptions are the given conditions. In this case, the function is defined as sin(x²), the domain is ℝ. The problem is to prove it's not uniformly continuous there. Therefore, the assumptions list the function and its domain, and the problem is the statement to prove.\n\nBut wait, the example included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the original problem's conditions. In the current problem, the original problem doesn't have such conditions except the function and domain. Therefore, the assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) = sin(x²) is defined on ℝ,\nThe domain of f is ℝ.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f is not uniformly continuous on ℝ.\n\nBut in the example, they split into two lines: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. So maybe here, the first assumption is the function definition, and the second is the domain. But perhaps the domain is part of the function's definition. Alternatively, the problem might have implicit assumptions like f is a real function, etc. However, the example's original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the problem's statement. In the current problem, the user is working on proving the non-uniform continuity, so the problem's assumptions would be the function and the domain. Therefore, structuring accordingly.",

Suppose for contradiction that $f$ were uniformly continuous. Then there would exist $\\delta > 0$ such that for all $x,y \\in \\mathbb{R}$ with $|x-y| < \\delta$, we have $|f(x) - f(y)| < \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nSince $|x_n - y_n| \\to 0$ as $n \\to \\infty$, we can choose $N$ large enough so that $|x_N - y_N| < \\delta$.\n\n**Step 7: Contradiction**\nFor this $N$, we have $|x_N - y_N| < \\delta$, so by the supposed uniform continuity, we should have $|f(x_N) - f(y_N)| < \\frac{1}{2}$. However, from Step 3, we know $|f(x_N) - f(y_N)| = 1 > \\frac{1}{2}$. This is a contradiction.\n\n**Step 8: Conclusion**\nTherefore, our assumption that $f$ is uniformly continuous leads to a contradiction. Hence, $f(x) = \\sin(x^2)$ is not uniformly continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**Alternative explanation**: The sequences $(x_n)$ and $(y_n)$ demonstrate that we can make $x_n$ and $y_n$ arbitrarily close (Step 4) while keeping $|f(x_n) - f(y_n)|$ fixed at 1 (Step 3). This violates the definition of uniform continuity, which requires that for any given $\\epsilon > 0$, we can find $\\delta > 0$ such that whenever points are within $\\delta$, their function values are within $\\epsilon$. By taking $\\epsilon = 1\/2$, we see that no matter how small $\\delta$ is, we can always find $x_n$ and $y_n$ with $|x_n - y_n| < \\delta$ but $|f(x_n) - f(y_n)| = 1 > 1\/2$.\n\nThus, $f(x) = \\sin(x^2)$ is not uniformly continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$.",
