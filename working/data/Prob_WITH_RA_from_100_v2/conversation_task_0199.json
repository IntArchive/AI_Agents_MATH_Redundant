Since $1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$ and $3 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$, we must have $n_5 = 1$.\n\nThus $G$ has a unique Sylow $3$-subgroup, call it $P_3$, and a unique Sylow $5$-subgroup, call it $P_5$.\n\n**Step 3: Normality of Sylow subgroups**\nA Sylow subgroup is normal if and only if it is unique. Since $P_3$ and $P_5$ are unique, they are normal subgroups of $G$. Therefore $P_3 \\trianglelefteq G$ and $P_5 \\trianglelefteq G$.\n\n**Step 4: Structure of $G$ as a direct product**\nBecause $P_3$ and $P_5$ are normal subgroups with trivial intersection ($P_3 \\cap P_5 = \\{e\\}$ since their orders are coprime) and $|P_3| \\cdot |P_5| = 3 \\cdot 5 = 15 = |G|$, we have $G = P_3 P_5 \\cong P_3 \\times P_5$. Moreover, $P_3$ and $P_5$ are cyclic groups of prime order, so $P_3 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_3$ and $P_5 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_5$. Hence\n\\[ G \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_5. \\]\nSince $3$ and $5$ are coprime, the Chinese Remainder Theorem gives $\\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{15}$. Therefore $G$ is cyclic of order $15$:\n\\[ G \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{15}. \\]\n\n**Step 5: Normality of subgroups in a cyclic group**\nLet $G = \\langle g \\rangle$ be a cyclic group generated by $g$. Every subgroup $H$ of $G$ is of the form $H = \\langle g^d \\rangle$ for some divisor $d$ of $|G|$. For any $x = g^k \\in G$, we have\n\\[ x H x^{-1} = g^k \\langle g^d \\rangle g^{-k} = \\langle g^{k} g^{d} g^{-k} \\rangle = \\langle g^{d} \\rangle = H. \\]\nThus every subgroup of a cyclic group is normal.\n\n**Step 6: Normality of $\\langle a \\rangle$**\nSince $G$ is cyclic, the subgroup $\\langle a \\rangle$ generated by any element $a \\in G$ is a subgroup of $G$. By Step 5, $\\langle a \\rangle$ is normal in $G$. Therefore, for every $b \\in G$,\n\\[ b \\langle a \\rangle b^{-1} = \\langle a \\rangle. \\]\n\n**Step 7: Conjugation of $a$ by $b$**\nBecause $b \\langle a \\rangle b^{-1} = \\langle a \\rangle$, the conjugate $bab^{-1}$ lies in $\\langle a \\rangle$. Indeed, $a \\in \\langle a \\rangle$, so $bab^{-1} \\in b \\langle a \\rangle b^{-1} = \\langle a \\rangle$.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWe have shown that $G$ is cyclic of order $15$, that every subgroup of a cyclic group is normal, and consequently that $\\langle a \\rangle$ is normal in $G$. Hence $bab^{-1} \\in \\langle a \\rangle$ for any $a, b \\in G$. This completes the proof.\n\n**Remark:** The proof relies on the Sylow theorems to establish that $G$ is cyclic. An alternative approach is to use the classification of groups of order $pq$ (with $p < q$ primes and $p \\nmid q-1$), which also yields that $G$ is cyclic. In our case $p=3$, $q=5$, and $3 \\nmid 4$, so the same conclusion follows.",
