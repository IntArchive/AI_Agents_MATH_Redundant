    "Content":"The largest eigenvalue of a stochastic matrix (i.e. a matrix whose entries are positive and whose rows add up to $1$) is $1$. Wikipedia marks this as a special case of the Perron-Frobenius theorem , but I wonder if there is a simpler (more direct) way to demonstrate this result.",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"Here's a really elementary proof (which is a slight modification of Fanfan's answer to a question of mine ). As Calle shows, it is easy to see that the eigenvalue $1$ is obtained.  Now, suppose $Ax = \\lambda x$ for some $\\lambda > 1$.  Since the rows of $A$ are nonnegative and sum to $1$, each element of vector $Ax$ is a convex combination of the components of $x$, which can be no greater than $x_{max}$, the largest component of $x$.  On the other hand, at least one element of $\\lambda x$ is greater than $x_{max}$, which proves that $\\lambda > 1$ is impossible.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified Assumption and Problem sections. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The title is \"Proof that the largest eigenvalue of a stochastic matrix is $1$\". The question states that a stochastic matrix has entries that are positive and whose rows add up to $1$. The user is asking for a simpler proof than using Perron-Frobenius.\n\nNow, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem is about a stochastic matrix. The assumptions should list each property one by one. Let's break down the definition of a stochastic matrix here. \n\nFirst assumption: The matrix has positive entries. Wait, actually, stochastic matrices are often defined as having non-negative entries, but the question here specifies \"positive\". However, I should check the exact wording. The original question says \"a matrix whose entries are positive and whose rows add up to $1$\". So according to the user's problem statement, entries are positive (not just non-negative), so that's one assumption. Each row sums to 1. So each row of the matrix adds up to 1. Also, the matrix in question is a stochastic matrix, so those are the key properties.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. The matrix has positive entries.\n2. Each row of the matrix adds up to 1.\n\nEach assumption addresses one property of the matrix. Then the problem is to prove that the largest eigenvalue is 1. \n\nWait, but sometimes in definitions, stochastic matrices can allow non-negative entries. But the question explicitly mentions entries are positive, so I have to stick with that. The user might have a stricter definition here, maybe. So I need to follow exactly what the question states. \n\nSo the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nEntries of the matrix are positive,\nEach row of the matrix adds up to 1.\nProblem:\nProve that the largest eigenvalue of the matrix is $1$.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me check the example provided. In the example, the assumption listed two points: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Then the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. So similarly, here, the two assumptions are about the matrix's entries and row sums, leading to the problem about the eigenvalue. That should be correct.",

    "mathematician and proof writer":"Assumption:\nAssumption 1: Entries of the matrix are positive\nAssumption 2: Each row of the matrix adds up to $1$\nProblem:\nProve that $\\lambda > 1$\nWe will prove that for a positive row-stochastic matrix $A$, the spectral radius $\\rho(A) = 1$, and $1$ is an eigenvalue of $A$.\n\n**Step 1: Setup and notation**\nLet $A = (a_{ij})$ be an $n \\times n$ matrix satisfying:\n1. $a_{ij} > 0$ for all $i,j = 1,\\ldots,n$ (positive entries)\n2. $\\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij} = 1$ for each $i = 1,\\ldots,n$ (row sums equal to 1)\n\n**Step 2: Show that 1 is an eigenvalue**\nConsider the all-ones vector $v = (1,1,\\ldots,1)^T \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. For each row $i$, we compute:\n\\[(Av)_i = \\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij} \\cdot 1 = \\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij} = 1 = v_i\\]\nThus $Av = v$, which means $v$ is an eigenvector of $A$ with eigenvalue $1$. Therefore, $1$ is an eigenvalue of $A$.\n\n**Step 3: Apply Perron-Frobenius theorem**\nSince $A$ has all positive entries, the Perron-Frobenius theorem for positive matrices applies. The theorem states:\n1. The spectral radius $\\rho(A)$ is a positive eigenvalue of $A$.\n2. There exists a positive eigenvector (all entries positive) corresponding to $\\rho(A)$.\n3. All other eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of $A$ satisfy $|\\lambda| \\leq \\rho(A)$.\n\n**Step 4: Show $\\rho(A) \\geq 1$**\nFrom Step 2, we know $1$ is an eigenvalue of $A$. Since $v > 0$ (all entries positive) and $Av = v$, by the Perron-Frobenius theorem, the spectral radius $\\rho(A)$ must be at least as large as the eigenvalue corresponding to any positive eigenvector. Therefore, $\\rho(A) \\geq 1$.\n\n**Step 5: Show $\\rho(A) \\leq 1$**\nLet $\\lambda$ be any eigenvalue of $A$ with corresponding eigenvector $x = (x_1,\\ldots,x_n)^T \\neq 0$. Let $k$ be an index such that $|x_k| = \\max_{i=1,\\ldots,n} |x_i| > 0$ (such $k$ exists since $x \\neq 0$).\n\nFrom the eigenvalue equation $Ax = \\lambda x$, we have for the $k$-th component:\n\\[\\lambda x_k = (Ax)_k = \\sum_{j=1}^n a_{kj} x_j\\]\n\nTaking absolute values and using the triangle inequality:\n\\[|\\lambda| |x_k| = \\left|\\sum_{j=1}^n a_{kj} x_j\\right| \\leq \\sum_{j=1}^n a_{kj} |x_j|\\]\n\nSince $|x_j| \\leq |x_k|$ for all $j$ (by definition of $k$), we have:\n\\[\\sum_{j=1}^n a_{kj} |x_j| \\leq \\sum_{j=1}^n a_{kj} |x_k| = |x_k| \\sum_{j=1}^n a_{kj} = |x_k| \\cdot 1 = |x_k|\\]\n\nThus $|\\lambda| |x_k| \\leq |x_k|$, and since $|x_k| > 0$, we can divide by $|x_k|$ to obtain $|\\lambda| \\leq 1$.\n\nSince this holds for every eigenvalue $\\lambda$ of $A$, we have $\\rho(A) = \\max\\{|\\lambda| : \\lambda \\text{ is an eigenvalue of } A\\} \\leq 1$.\n\n**Step 6: Conclusion**\nFrom Steps 4 and 5, we have $\\rho(A) \\geq 1$ and $\\rho(A) \\leq 1$, which implies $\\rho(A) = 1$. Moreover, from Step 2, we know that $1$ is indeed an eigenvalue of $A$.\n\nTherefore, for any positive row-stochastic matrix $A$, the spectral radius $\\rho(A) = 1$, and $1$ is an eigenvalue of $A$ with corresponding eigenvector $v = (1,1,\\ldots,1)^T$.\n\n**Additional remarks:** The proof shows that all eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of $A$ satisfy $|\\lambda| \\leq 1$, with equality for $\\lambda = 1$. This is a stronger result than just showing $\\rho(A) = 1$.",
