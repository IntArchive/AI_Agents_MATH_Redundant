    "Content":"I was recently exposed to the problem of deciding whether\n$$ \\lim_{n \\to +\\infty} |n \\cos n| = +\\infty$$\nwhere the limit is taken over the integers. As $|\\cos n|$ oscillates throughout the interval $[0,1]$, it seems plausible that every real number ought to be a limit point of this sequence. But to show the limit doesn't exist, it's enough to show the sequence is less than $2$ infinitely often, and this can be done with continued fractions: we can find arbitrarily large $p$ and $q$ with $q$ odd such that\n$$ \\left| \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{p}{q} \\right| < \\frac{1}{q^2} $$\nwhich implies\n$$ \\left| \\frac{q-1}{2} \\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{2} - p \\right| < \\frac{1}{q} $$\nmaking $p$ a good approximation of $\\pi\/2$ modulo $\\pi$, and thus\n$$ \\left| p \\cos p \\right| < \\frac{p}{q} < 2 $$ This method fails if we consider instead the sequence $n^{1+\\epsilon} \\cos n$, since the final inequality is an increasing function of $n$. In fact, a heuristic statistical argument suggests that\n$$ \\lim_{n \\to +\\infty} |n^{1 + \\epsilon} \\cos n| = +\\infty $$\nreally does hold: imagine the $n$'s are actually uniformly randomly selected from $[0, \\pi]$, there is a roughly $2p\/\\pi$ chance that $|\\cos n| < p$. For any positive constant $B$, the expected number of terms of $n^{1 + \\epsilon} |\\cos n|$ which are less than $B$ is\n$$ \\sum_{n=1}^{+\\infty} \\frac{2B}{\\pi n^{1 + \\epsilon}} $$\nwhich, in particular, is finite. Of course, this is just heuristic. Does anyone know of a proof or disproof of the conjecture\n$$ \\lim_{n \\to +\\infty} |n^{1 + \\epsilon} \\cos n| = +\\infty $$\nfor positive real numbers $\\epsilon$, where the limit is taken only over integers? EDIT: Since there have been a few erroneous answers, I'll point out that observing $|\\cos n|$ oscillates from 0 to 1 is not enough to show the limit does not exist. Consider the sequence $g(n)$ defined by $g(0) = 1$ $g(n) = \\max\\{ g(n-1), n \/ |\\cos n| \\} + 1$ Then $g(n)$ is an unbounded increasing sequence such that $|g(n) \\cos n| > n$ for all $n$, and thus $$ \\lim_{n \\to +\\infty} |g(n) \\cos n| = +\\infty $$ Roughly speaking, $g(n)$ diverges to $+\\infty$ faster than $n \\pmod \\pi$ can approximate $\\pi \/ 2$. The question of this post is whether $n^2$ (or $n^{1 + \\epsilon}$) also diverges to $+\\infty$ fast enough.",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"(editor's note: I've moved the original second section to the top, since the original first section answered the wrong question) Edit: I missed the exponent of $2$. Obviously $(6)$ implies, $\\displaystyle\\limsup_{n\\to\\infty}|n^2\\cos(n)|=\\infty$. However, evaluating $\\displaystyle\\liminf_{n\\to\\infty}|n^2\\cos(n)|$ is much more difficult. A difficult result is that the irrationality measure of $\\frac\\pi2$ is less than $8.01604539$. This means that for all but a finite number of rational approximations,\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{p}{q}-\\frac\\pi2\\right|\\ge\\frac1{q^{8.01604539}}\\tag{7}\n$$\nTo make the estimate in $(3)$ yield an infinite limit, we would need to show that the irrationality measure of $\\frac\\pi2$ is less than $3$. Wikipedia says that \"The exact irrationality measure of $\\pi$ is not known, however in $2008$ Salikhov has given the approximation $7.6063$.\" This would mean that $\\displaystyle\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}|n^2\\cos(n)|$ does not exist. As was shown in this answer , we can find an infinite number of continued fraction approximations of $\\frac\\pi2=\\frac{p}{q}$ with $q$ odd and so that\n$$\n\\left|p-q\\frac\\pi2\\right|\\le\\frac1q\\tag{1}\n$$\nFor approximations as in $(1)$, we have, by Maclaurin Expansion,\n$$\n(-1)^{(q-1)\/2}\\cos(p)=-\\left(p-q\\frac\\pi2\\right)+O\\left(p-q\\frac\\pi2\\right)^3\\tag{2}\n$$\nTaking $\\liminf$, we get\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\liminf_{p\\to\\infty}|p\\cos(p)|\n&\\le\\lim_{p\\to\\infty}p\\cdot\\frac{1}{q}\\\\\n&=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\tag{3}\n\\end{align}\n$$\nIn a similar fashion, we can find an infinite number of continued fraction approximations of $\\pi=\\frac{p}{q}$ so that\n$$\n\\left|p-q\\pi\\right|\\le\\frac1q\\tag{4}\n$$\nFor approximations as in $(4)$, we have, by Maclaurin Expansion,\n$$\n(-1)^q\\cos(p)\\ge1-\\frac12\\left(p-q\\pi\\right)^2\\tag{5}\n$$\nTaking $\\limsup$, we get\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\limsup_{p\\to\\infty}|p\\cos(p)|\n&\\ge\\lim_{p\\to\\infty}p\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2q^2}\\right)\\\\\n&=\\infty\\tag{6}\n\\end{align}\n$$\nThus, $\\displaystyle\\liminf_{n\\to\\infty}|n\\cos(n)|\\le\\frac\\pi2$ and $\\displaystyle\\limsup_{n\\to\\infty}|n\\cos(n)|=\\infty$. Therefore, the limit does not exist.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify the key assumptions and the main problem statement.\n\nThe original question is about whether the sequence |n² cos n| diverges to infinity as n approaches infinity. The user mentions the case with n^1+ε cos n and whether this limit holds for positive ε. There's a discussion about using continued fractions and heuristic arguments. The problem also clarifies that the limit is taken over integers and involves positive real numbers ε.\n\nNow, I need to list the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single condition applied to one object. Looking at the problem, the main objects are ε and n. The assumptions would be that ε is a positive real number and n is an integer approaching infinity. The problem statement then asks to prove or disprove the limit of |n^{1+ε} cos n| as n approaches infinity.\n\nWait, the title mentions n², but in the detailed question, it's generalized to n^{1+ε}. So the problem is about n^{1+ε} with ε > 0. The user edited to clarify that the limit is over integers and ε is positive real. So the assumptions are ε is a positive real number, n is an integer approaching infinity. The problem is to determine if the limit of |n^{1+ε} cos n| is infinity.\n\nI should check the example again. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions are ε is a positive real number, and n approaches infinity over integers. So I need to phrase each assumption per line, each addressing one property of one object.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nε is a positive real number,\nn approaches infinity over integers.\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that $$\\lim_{n \\to +\\infty} |n^{1 + \\epsilon} \\cos n| = +\\infty.$$\n\nWait, the original problem in the title was about n², but in the body, it's generalized. However, the user's final question is about n^{1+ε}. So the formatted problem should reflect that. The title's specific case (n²) is a special case when ε=1, but the main problem is for any ε>0. So the problem statement should be the general one with ε.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are ε is positive, n is integer approaching infinity, and the problem is proving the limit of |n^{1+ε} cos n| is infinity.\n\nI need to ensure that the problem statement is correctly extracted. The user also mentions \"the conjecture\" in the original question, which is exactly the limit statement. So the formatted problem should be as above.\n\nAnother check: the example had assumptions listed as two separate points. Here, similarly, we have two assumptions: one about ε and one about n. So that's correct.",

This requires making specific choices for the undefined terms.\n    *   Assume `p` is an integer variable approaching infinity.\n    *   The proof relies on finding a sequence of integers `p_k` such that `p_k` is close to an odd multiple of `\\pi\/2`. This can be done using rational approximations of `2\/\\pi`.\n    *   By Dirichlet's approximation theorem, there exists a sequence of integers `p_k, m_k` (where we can stipulate `m_k` is odd) such that `|2\/\\pi - m_k\/p_k| < 1\/p_k^2`.\n    *   From this, one can derive the inequality `|\\cos(p_k)| < \\pi\/(2p_k)`.\n    *   If we **define** a real-valued sequence `q_k = 2p_k\/\\pi`, then the inequality becomes `|\\cos(p_k)| < 1\/q_k`, which implies `|p_k \\cos(p_k)| < p_k\/q_k`.\n    *   With this definition of `q_k`, the limit is `\\lim_{k\\to\\infty} p_k\/q_k = \\lim_{k\\to\\infty} p_k \/ (2p_k\/\\pi) = \\pi\/2`.\n    *   Combining these steps proves that there is a sequence `p_k` for which `|p_k \\cos(p_k)|` is bounded by a sequence converging to `\\pi\/2`, which in turn proves `\\liminf_{p\\to\\infty}|p\\cos(p)| \\le \\pi\/2`.\n\n3.  **Conclusion**: While the mathematical statement is correct and the sketch hints at a valid proof strategy, the presentation itself is not a proof.
