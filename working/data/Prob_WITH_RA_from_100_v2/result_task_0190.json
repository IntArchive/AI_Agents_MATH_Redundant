    "Content":"I am working on a homework problem from Avner Friedman's Advanced Calculus (#1 page 68) which asks Suppose that $f(x)$ is a continuous function on the interval $[0,\\infty)$. Prove that if $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x)$ exists (as a real number), then $f(x)$ is uniformly continuous on this interval. Intuitively, this argument makes sense to me. Since the limit of $f(x)$ exists on $[0,\\infty)$, we will be able to find a $\\delta > |x_0 - x_1|$ and this implies that, for any $\\epsilon>0$, we have $\\epsilon > |f(x_0) - f(x_1)|$ (independent of the points chosen). I am aware that the condition of uniform continuity requires that $\\delta$ can only be a function of $\\epsilon$, not $x$. What information does the existence of a real-valued limit provide that implies $f(x)$ is uniformly continuous on this interval?",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"Remember the definition of \"uniformly continuous\": $f(x)$ is uniformly continuous on $[0,\\infty)$ if and only if for every $\\epsilon\\gt 0$ there exists $\\delta\\gt 0$ such that for all $x,y\\in [0,\\infty)$, if $|x-y|\\lt \\delta$, then $|f(x)-f(y)|\\lt \\epsilon$. We also know that the limit exists. Call\n$$\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x) = L.$$\nThat means that: For every $\\varepsilon\\gt 0$ there exists $N\\gt 0$ (which depends on $\\varepsilon$) such that if $x\\gt N$, then $|f(x)-L|\\lt \\varepsilon$. Finally, you probably know that if $f(x)$ is continuous on a finite closed interval, then it is uniformly continuous on that interval. So: let $\\epsilon\\gt 0$. We need to show that there exists $\\delta\\gt0$ such that for all $x,y\\in [0,\\infty)$, if $|x-y|\\lt \\delta$, then $|f(x)-f(y)|\\lt\\epsilon$. We first use a common trick: if you know that any value of $f(x)$ in some interval is within $k$ of $L$, then you know that any two values of $f(x)$ in that interval are within $2k$ of each other : because if $|f(x)-L|\\lt k$ and $|f(y)-L|\\lt k$, then\n$$|f(x)-f(y)| = |f(x)-L + L-f(y)| \\leq |f(x)-L| + |L-f(y)| \\lt k+k = 2k.$$ So: pick $N\\gt 0$ such that for all $x\\gt N$, $|f(x)-L|\\lt \\epsilon\/2$. That means that if $x,y\\gt N$, then $|f(x)-f(y)|\\lt \\epsilon$, by the argument above. So we are \"fine\" if both $x$ and $y$ are greater than $N$. Now, we just need to worry about what happens if both $x$ and $y$ are in $[0,N]$, or if one of $x$ and $y$ is in $[0,N]$ and the other one is in $(N,\\infty)$. For both in $[0,N]$, we are in luck: since $f$ is continuous on $[0,\\infty)$, then it is continuous on the finite closed interval $[0,N]$, hence is uniformly continuous there. So we know there exists $\\delta_1\\gt 0$ such that for all $x,y\\in [0,N]$, if $|x-y|\\lt\\delta_1$, then we have $|f(x)-f(y)|\\lt \\epsilon$. So we just need to ensure that $x$ and $y$ are within $\\delta_1$ of each other; that will ensure the inequality we want if $x$ and $y$ are both in $[0,N]$, or if they are both in $(N,\\infty)$. Now we run into a slight problem: what if, say, $x\\in [0,N]$ and $y\\in (N,\\infty)$? Well, since $f$ is continuous at $N$, we know that we can ensure that $f(x)$ and $f(y)$ are both as close as we want to $f(N)$ provided that $x$ and $y$ are both very close to $N$. But if $x$ and $y$ are within some $\\ell$ of $N$, then they are within $2\\ell$ of each other (same argument as before); and if $f(x)$ and $f(y)$ are both within some $k$ of $f(N)$, then they will be within $2k$ of each other. So: let $\\delta_2$ be such that if $|a-N|\\lt\\delta_2$, then $|f(a)-f(N)|\\lt \\epsilon\/2$. Then, if $x$ and $y$ are both within $\\delta_2$ of $N$, then $|f(x)-f(y)|\\lt \\epsilon$, and we'll be fine. In summary: we want to select a $\\delta\\gt 0$ that will ensure that if $|x-y|\\lt\\delta$, then: If $x$ and $y$ are both less than $N$, then $|x-y|\\lt \\delta_1$; If $x$ and $y$ are both greater than $N$, then it doesn't matter how close to one another they are; and If one of $x$ and $y$ is less than $N$ and the other is larger than $N$, then they are each within $\\delta_2$ of $N$. To make sure the first condition happens, we just need to make sure that $\\delta\\leq\\delta_1$. The second condition is easy. What should we require of $\\delta$ in order for the second condition to hold? If we can find a $\\delta$ that makes all three things happens simultaneously, we'll be done.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about proving that a function is uniformly continuous on [0, ∞) given that it has a limit as x approaches infinity. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The problem states that f(x) is continuous on [0, ∞). So that's one assumption. Then, the existence of the limit as x approaches infinity is another condition. Wait, the problem says \"if the limit exists (as a real number)\", so that's another assumption. Each assumption should be on a separate line and address one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nf is continuous on [0, ∞),\nThe limit of f(x) as x approaches infinity exists and is a real number.\n\nProblem: Prove that f is uniformly continuous on [0, ∞).\n\nWait, but in the example provided, the assumption included specific conditions on n. Here, the assumptions are about the function f: its continuity on the interval and the existence of the limit. These are two separate conditions. So each should be a separate bullet point under assumptions.\n\nThe problem statement is straightforward: prove uniform continuity on the interval. \n\nLet me check if there are any other implicit assumptions. The function is defined on [0, ∞), which is given. The continuity is explicitly stated, so that's covered. The existence of the limit is another explicit condition. I don't think there are other assumptions here. So the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is continuous on the interval [0, ∞),\nThe limit of f(x) as x approaches ∞ exists (as a real number).\nProblem:\nProve that f is uniformly continuous on [0, ∞).\n\nI think that's correct. Each assumption is a single condition on the function f. The problem is to prove uniform continuity. The original question had some extra text about the user's intuition and confusion about δ depending only on ε, but in the formatting example, those parts were filtered out. So the key is to extract only the necessary assumptions and the problem statement.",

This $M$ depends on $\\varepsilon$.\n\n**Step 2: Choose $k = \\varepsilon$.**\nLet $k = \\varepsilon$. Then for any $x > M$, we have $|f(x) - L| < k$.

We can rewrite it as:\n\\[ |f(x) - f(y)| = |f(x) - L + L - f(y)|. \\]\nNow apply the triangle inequality $|a + b| \\le |a| + |b|$ with $a = f(x) - L$ and $b = L - f(y)$:\n\\[ |f(x) - L + L - f(y)| \\le |f(x) - L| + |L - f(y)|. \\]\nNote that $|L - f(y)| = |f(y) - L|$.\n\n**Step 4: Substitute the bounds from Step 2.**\nSince $x > M$, we have $|f(x) - L| < k$. Since $y > M$, we have $|f(y) - L| < k$. Therefore,\n\\[ |f(x) - L| + |f(y) - L| < k + k = 2k. \\]\n\n**Step 5: Combine the inequalities.**\nPutting everything together, we obtain:\n\\[ |f(x) - f(y)| \\le |f(x) - L| + |f(y) - L| < 2k = 2\\varepsilon. \\]\n\n**Step 6: Conclusion.**\nThus, for any $\\varepsilon > 0$, we have found $M > 0$ (the same $M$ from the limit definition) such that for all $x, y > M$, we have $|f(x) - f(y)| < 2\\varepsilon$. This shows that $f$ is uniformly continuous on the interval $[M, \\infty)$. More precisely, given $\\varepsilon > 0$, choose $\\delta = \\varepsilon$ (or any positive number) and $M$ as above; then whenever $x, y > M$, regardless of how close they are, we have $|f(x) - f(y)| < 2\\varepsilon$. This is the essence of uniform continuity on $[M, \\infty)$.\n\n**Remark:** The continuity of $f$ on $[0, \\infty)$ ensures that $f$ is uniformly continuous on the compact interval $[0, M+1]$ by the Heine-Cantor theorem. Combining this with the uniform continuity on $[M, \\infty)$ (proved above) yields that $f$ is uniformly continuous on the entire $[0, \\infty)$. However, the problem specifically asks for the inequality $|f(x)-f(y)| < 2\\varepsilon$ for $x, y > M$, which we have established.",
