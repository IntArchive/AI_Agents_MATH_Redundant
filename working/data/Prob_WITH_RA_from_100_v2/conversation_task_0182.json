Note that |S| = k.\n\n**Step 2: Associate each element m ∈ S with a divisor d of k**\nFor each m ∈ S, define d = gcd(m, k), the greatest common divisor of m and k.\n\n**Step 3: d is always a divisor of k**\nSince d = gcd(m, k), by definition of greatest common divisor, d divides both m and k. In particular, d | k. Therefore, for each m ∈ S, the associated d is a divisor of k.\n\n**Step 4: Count elements m with a given gcd d**\nFix a divisor d of k. We want to count how many m ∈ S satisfy gcd(m, k) = d.\n\n**Step 5: Characterization of m with gcd(m, k) = d**\nWe claim that gcd(m, k) = d if and only if m can be written as m = d·t where:\n1. 1 ≤ t ≤ k/d\n2. gcd(t, k/d) = 1\n\nProof of the claim:\n(⇒) Suppose gcd(m, k) = d. Since d divides both m and k, we can write m = d·t and k = d·(k/d) for some integers t and k/d. Then:\n   d = gcd(d·t, d·(k/d)) = d·gcd(t, k/d)\nDividing both sides by d (which is positive), we get 1 = gcd(t, k/d). Also, since 1 ≤ m ≤ k, we have 1 ≤ d·t ≤ d·(k/d), so 1 ≤ t ≤ k/d.\n\n(⇐) Conversely, suppose m = d·t with 1 ≤ t ≤ k/d and gcd(t, k/d) = 1. Then:\n   gcd(m, k) = gcd(d·t, d·(k/d)) = d·gcd(t, k/d) = d·1 = d.\n\n**Step 6: Counting such t using Euler's totient function**\nFor a fixed divisor d of k, the number of integers t satisfying:\n1. 1 ≤ t ≤ k/d\n2. gcd(t, k/d) = 1\nis exactly φ(k/d) by definition of Euler's totient function.\n\n**Step 7: Number of m with gcd(m, k) = d**\nTherefore, for each divisor d of k, there are exactly φ(k/d) elements m ∈ S with gcd(m, k) = d.\n\n**Step 8: Sum over all divisors d of k**\nNow sum over all divisors d of k. Since each m ∈ S has a unique gcd(m, k) = d for some divisor d of k, and we have counted all m ∈ S in this way, we get:\n∑_{d|k} φ(k/d) = |S| = k.\n\n**Step 9: Reindexing the sum**\nObserve that as d runs over all divisors of k, the expression k/d also runs over all divisors of k (since if d is a divisor of k, then k/d is also a divisor of k). Therefore:\n∑_{d|k} φ(k/d) = ∑_{d|k} φ(d).\nThis is a simple reindexing: for each divisor d of k, let d' = k/d, which is also a divisor of k. Then as d runs over all divisors, d' also runs over all divisors, and φ(k/d) = φ(d').\n\n**Step 10: Conclusion**\nCombining Steps 8 and 9, we have:\n∑_{d|k} φ(d) = ∑_{d|k} φ(k/d) = k.\n\nThus we have proved that ∑_{d|k} φ(d) = k for all positive integers k. ∎",
