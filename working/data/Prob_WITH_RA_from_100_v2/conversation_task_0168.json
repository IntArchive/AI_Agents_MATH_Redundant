            "text": "**Step 5: Proving the new problem**\nNow I need to prove that P^T = P^{-1} given that P is a permutation matrix (assumptions 2-4).\n\nProof outline:\n1. Let P be an n×n permutation matrix (each row/column has exactly one 1, others 0)\n2. Show that P^T P = I (identity matrix)\n3. Show that P P^T = I\n4. Therefore P^T = P^{-1}\n\nLet me write the complete solution:\n\n**Solution:**\nLet P be an n×n permutation matrix. By definition:\n- Each row has exactly one entry equal to 1, all others 0\n- Each column has exactly one entry equal to 1, all others 0\n\nConsider the product P^T P. The (i,j)-entry of P^T P is:\n(P^T P)_{ij} = ∑_{k=1}^n (P^T)_{ik} P_{kj} = ∑_{k=1}^n P_{ki} P_{kj}\n\nNow analyze this sum:\n- If i = j: There exists exactly one column k where P_{ki} = 1 (since column i has exactly one 1). For this k, P_{kj} = P_{ki} = 1. For all other k, P_{ki} = 0. So ∑_{k=1}^n P_{ki} P_{ki} = 1.\n- If i ≠ j: For any k, we cannot have both P_{ki} = 1 and P_{kj} = 1 because that would mean column k has 1's in two different rows i and j, contradicting that each column has exactly one 1. So ∑_{k=1}^n P_{ki} P_{kj} = 0.\n\nThus P^T P = I (identity matrix).\n\nSimilarly, consider P P^T. The (i,j)-entry is:\n(P P^T)_{ij} = ∑_{k=1}^n P_{ik} (P^T)_{kj} = ∑_{k=1}^n P_{ik} P_{jk}\n\nBy the same reasoning:\n- If i = j: There exists exactly one k where P_{ik} = 1 (since row i has exactly one 1). For this k, P_{jk} = P_{ik} = 1. So ∑_{k=1}^n P_{ik} P_{ik} = 1.\n- If i ≠ j: For any k, we cannot have both P_{ik} = 1 and P_{jk} = 1 because that would mean row i and row j both have a 1 in column k, but each column has exactly one 1, so this is impossible. Thus ∑_{k=1}^n P_{ik} P_{jk} = 0.\n\nThus P P^T = I.\n\nSince P^T P = I and P P^T = I, we have P^T = P^{-1}.

Since row i has exactly one entry equal to 1, let this occur at column c (so P_{i,c} = 1). For all other columns k ≠ c, we have P_{i,k} = 0.\n\nThen:\nS_{ii} = ∑_{k=1}^n P_{ik} P_{ik} = ∑_{k=1}^n (P_{ik})^2\n\nSince P_{ik} ∈ {0,1}, we have (P_{ik})^2 = P_{ik}. Therefore:\nS_{ii} = ∑_{k=1}^n P_{ik}\n\nBut ∑_{k=1}^n P_{ik} = 1 because row i contains exactly one 1 and all other entries are 0.\n\nThus, S_{ii} = 1 when i = j.\n\n**Case 2: i ≠ j**\nLet i ≠ j. Consider any fixed column k (1 ≤ k ≤ n). Since each column of P contains exactly one entry equal to 1, at most one of P_{ik} or P_{jk} can be 1. There are two subcases:\n\n- If column k has its 1 in some row other than i and j, then P_{ik} = 0 and P_{jk} = 0, so P_{ik}P_{jk} = 0.\n- If column k has its 1 in row i, then P_{ik} = 1 and P_{jk} = 0 (since the 1 cannot be in row j as well), so P_{ik}P_{jk} = 1·0 = 0.\n- If column k has its 1 in row j, then P_{ik} = 0 and P_{jk} = 1, so P_{ik}P_{jk} = 0·1 = 0.\n\nIn all possible situations for column k, we have P_{ik}P_{jk} = 0. Since this holds for every k from 1 to n, we have:\nS_{ij} = ∑_{k=1}^n P_{ik} P_{jk} = ∑_{k=1}^n 0 = 0\n\nThus, S_{ij} = 0 when i ≠ j.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWe have shown that:\n∑_{k=1}^n P_{ik} P_{jk} = 1 if i = j\n∑_{k=1}^n P_{ik} P_{jk} = 0 if i ≠ j\n\nThis can be expressed compactly using the Kronecker delta δ_{ij}:\n∑_{k=1}^n P_{ik} P_{jk} = δ_{ij}\n\nwhere δ_{ij} = 1 if i = j and δ_{ij} = 0 if i ≠ j.\n\nThis completes the proof.",

Therefore P_{ik}P_{jk} = 0 for all k, so S_ij = 0.\nStep 5) Formal justification: The product P_{ik}P_{jk} is 1 only if both entries are 1. This can only occur when i=j and k is the unique column where row i has its 1. For i≠j, the columns where rows i and j have their 1's are different, so the product is always 0.\nStep 6) Conclude that ∑_{k=1}^n P_{ik} P_{jk} equals 1 when i=j and 0 when i≠j, which is the Kronecker delta δ_ij.",
