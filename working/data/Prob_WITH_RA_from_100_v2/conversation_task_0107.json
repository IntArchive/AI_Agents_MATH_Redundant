        "mathematician and proof writer": "Assumption:\nAssumption 1: Entries of the matrix are positive\nAssumption 2: Each row of the matrix adds up to $1$\nProblem:\nProve that $\\lambda > 1$\nWe will prove that for a positive row-stochastic matrix $A$, the spectral radius $\\rho(A) = 1$, and $1$ is an eigenvalue of $A$.\n\n**Step 1: Setup and notation**\nLet $A = (a_{ij})$ be an $n \\times n$ matrix satisfying:\n1. $a_{ij} > 0$ for all $i,j = 1,\\ldots,n$ (positive entries)\n2. $\\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij} = 1$ for each $i = 1,\\ldots,n$ (row sums equal to 1)\n\n**Step 2: Show that 1 is an eigenvalue**\nConsider the all-ones vector $v = (1,1,\\ldots,1)^T \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. For each row $i$, we compute:\n\\[(Av)_i = \\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij} \\cdot 1 = \\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij} = 1 = v_i\\]\nThus $Av = v$, which means $v$ is an eigenvector of $A$ with eigenvalue $1$. Therefore, $1$ is an eigenvalue of $A$.\n\n**Step 3: Apply Perron-Frobenius theorem**\nSince $A$ has all positive entries, the Perron-Frobenius theorem for positive matrices applies. The theorem states:\n1. The spectral radius $\\rho(A)$ is a positive eigenvalue of $A$.\n2. There exists a positive eigenvector (all entries positive) corresponding to $\\rho(A)$.\n3. All other eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of $A$ satisfy $|\\lambda| \\leq \\rho(A)$.\n\n**Step 4: Show $\\rho(A) \\geq 1$**\nFrom Step 2, we know $1$ is an eigenvalue of $A$. Since $v > 0$ (all entries positive) and $Av = v$, by the Perron-Frobenius theorem, the spectral radius $\\rho(A)$ must be at least as large as the eigenvalue corresponding to any positive eigenvector. Therefore, $\\rho(A) \\geq 1$.\n\n**Step 5: Show $\\rho(A) \\leq 1$**\nLet $\\lambda$ be any eigenvalue of $A$ with corresponding eigenvector $x = (x_1,\\ldots,x_n)^T \\neq 0$. Let $k$ be an index such that $|x_k| = \\max_{i=1,\\ldots,n} |x_i| > 0$ (such $k$ exists since $x \\neq 0$).\n\nFrom the eigenvalue equation $Ax = \\lambda x$, we have for the $k$-th component:\n\\[\\lambda x_k = (Ax)_k = \\sum_{j=1}^n a_{kj} x_j\\]\n\nTaking absolute values and using the triangle inequality:\n\\[|\\lambda| |x_k| = \\left|\\sum_{j=1}^n a_{kj} x_j\\right| \\leq \\sum_{j=1}^n a_{kj} |x_j|\\]\n\nSince $|x_j| \\leq |x_k|$ for all $j$ (by definition of $k$), we have:\n\\[\\sum_{j=1}^n a_{kj} |x_j| \\leq \\sum_{j=1}^n a_{kj} |x_k| = |x_k| \\sum_{j=1}^n a_{kj} = |x_k| \\cdot 1 = |x_k|\\]\n\nThus $|\\lambda| |x_k| \\leq |x_k|$, and since $|x_k| > 0$, we can divide by $|x_k|$ to obtain $|\\lambda| \\leq 1$.\n\nSince this holds for every eigenvalue $\\lambda$ of $A$, we have $\\rho(A) = \\max\\{|\\lambda| : \\lambda \\text{ is an eigenvalue of } A\\} \\leq 1$.\n\n**Step 6: Conclusion**\nFrom Steps 4 and 5, we have $\\rho(A) \\geq 1$ and $\\rho(A) \\leq 1$, which implies $\\rho(A) = 1$. Moreover, from Step 2, we know that $1$ is indeed an eigenvalue of $A$.\n\nTherefore, for any positive row-stochastic matrix $A$, the spectral radius $\\rho(A) = 1$, and $1$ is an eigenvalue of $A$ with corresponding eigenvector $v = (1,1,\\ldots,1)^T$.\n\n**Additional remarks:** The proof shows that all eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of $A$ satisfy $|\\lambda| \\leq 1$, with equality for $\\lambda = 1$. This is a stronger result than just showing $\\rho(A) = 1$.",
