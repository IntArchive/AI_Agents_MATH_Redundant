    "Content":"Picard's little theorem says that If there exist two complex numbers $a,b$ such that $f: \\Bbb{C} \\to \\Bbb{C}\\setminus \\{a,b\\}$ is holomorphic then $f$ is constant. I am interested in proofs for this theorem. Until now I found at least two, one in W. Rudin's Real and Complex Analysis and another one in S. Krantz, Geometric Function Theory . Both of them need some preparation before someone not very advanced in Complex Analysis could understand them, especially the one in S. Krantz's book. My questions are How many proofs are there for Picard's little theorem? (references if possible) Is there a \"simple\" proof for Picard's little theorem? Simple means that it could be presented to an audience which had a one semester course in complex analysis. Thank you.",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"There is an essentially elementary proof that can be presented to an audience having only little background in complex analysis. Apart from miraculous trickery and some simple estimates, the only ingredients are Cauchy's integral formula and the existence of holomorphic logarithms on simply connected domains. A much more complete exposition can be found in Remmert, Classical Topics in Complex Function Theory , Springer GTM 172, chapter 10. Let me emphasize: the following is only a distillate of the parts from Remmert's chapter 10 needed for a proof of Picard's little theorem. Said chapter contains a lot more: extensive historical remarks and references, variants of the proofs and further developments, improvements of the results, some nice applications of Picard's theorem and it culminates in a proof of Picard's great theorem. I once presented this argument to a group of talented students in a two hours “Christmas special lecture” and I think it worked quite well, but admittedly it is ambitious and the argument is flabbergasting at various points. The main ingredient in the proof is the amazing: Theorem (Bloch). If $f$ is holomorphic in a neighborhood of the closed unit disk $\\overline{\\mathbb D}$ and $f'(0) = 1$ then $f(\\mathbb{D})$ contains a disk of radius $\\frac{3}{2} - \\sqrt 2 \\gt 0$. Remmert prefaces the section containing this result by a statement of J.E. Littlewood: One of the queerest things in mathematics, ... the proof itself is crazy. I'll give a proof at the end of this answer. The way this is applied is: Exercise. If $f: \\mathbb{C} \\to \\mathbb{C}$ is holomorphic and non-constant then $f(\\mathbb{C})$ contains disks of arbitrary radius. Hint: If $f'(0) \\neq 0$ then $g(z) = \\frac{f(rz)}{r |f'(0)|}$ satisfies the hypothesis of Bloch's theorem. There's a second tricky ingredient, due to Landau and refined by König: Let $G \\subset \\mathbb{C}$ be a simply connected domain and let $f: G \\to \\mathbb{C}$ be holomorphic. If $f(G)$ does not contain $0$ and $1$ then there is a holomorphic $g: G \\to \\mathbb{C}$ such that $$f = \\frac{1}{2}\\big(1+ \\cos{(\\pi\\cos{(\\pi g)})}\\big).$$\n  Moreover, if $g$ is any such function then $g(G)$ does not contain a disk of radius one. Simple connectedness is used in guise of existence of roots and logarithms of holomorphic functions omitting the value $0$ . Let us show first that for a function $h$ on a simply connected domain $G$ such that $\\pm 1 \\notin h(G)$ there is a holomorphic $H:G \\to \\mathbb{C}$ such that $h = \\cos{H}$: The trick is that $1-h^2$ has no zero, hence there exists $k$ such that $k^2 = 1-h^2$, so $1 = h^2 + k^2 = (h+ik)(h-ik)$. But this means that $h+ik$ doesn't have a zero either, hence it has a logarithm: $h+ik = e^{iH}$ and thus $h = \\frac{1}{2}(e^{iH}+e^{-iH})$. Applying this to $h = 2f-1$ (which leaves out the values $\\pm 1$ by hypothesis) we get an $F$ such that $h=\\cos{(\\pi F)}$, but $F$ must leave out all integer values in its range, hence $F = \\cos{(\\pi g)}$ and unwinding the construction gives us the desired $f=\\frac{1}{2}\\big(1+ \\cos{(\\pi\\cos{(\\pi g)})}\\big)$. The “moreover” part follows from the observation that $g(G)$ must not hit the set $$A = \\left\\{m \\pm \\frac{i}{\\pi} \\log{\\big(n+\\sqrt{n^2 - 1}\\big)},\\;m\\in\\mathbb{Z},\\;n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\smallsetminus\\{0\\}\\right\\}$$\nsince for $a \\in A$ we have $\\cos{(\\pi a)} = (-1)^m \\cdot n$ by a short calculation. Thus $\\cos{(\\pi\\cos{(\\pi a)})} = \\pm 1$ and if there were $z \\in G$ such that $g(z) \\in A$ we would have $f(z) \\in \\{0,1\\}$ contradicting the assumptions. It is not hard to convince oneself that every point $w \\in \\mathbb{C}$ is within distance $\\lt 1$ of some point of $A$ (a picture would help!), hence $g(G)$ can't contain a disk of radius $1$. Armed with these two ingredients the proof of Picard's little theorem is immediate: Picard's little theorem. If there exist two complex numbers $a,b$ such that $f: \\mathbb{C} \\to \\mathbb{C}\\smallsetminus \\{a,b\\}$ is holomorphic then $f$ is constant. Proof. We may assume $\\{a,b\\} = \\{0,1\\}$. By the Landau–König theorem we have $f(z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\big(1+ \\cos{(\\pi\\cos{(\\pi g)})}\\big)$ for some $g$ whose image does not contain a disk of radius $1$ and by the exercise to Bloch's theorem $g$ must be constant. Now for the proof of Bloch's theorem: Lemma. Let $f$ be holomorphic in a neighborhood of the closure of the disk $D = B_r(a)$ and assume that $|f'(z)| \\lt 2|f'(a)|$ for $z \\in D$. Put $\\rho = (3-2\\sqrt{2})\\cdot r \\cdot |f'(a)|$ then $B_{\\rho}(f(a)) \\subset f(D)$. Proof. Assume $a = f(a) = 0$ for simplicity of notation and write $C = \\sup\\limits_{z \\in D}{\\,|f'(z)|}$. Put $A(z) = f(z) - f'(0)\\cdot z$. Then $A(z) = \\int_{0}^{z} (f'(w) - f'(0))\\,dw$, so\n$$|A(z)| \\leq \\int_{0}^{1} |f'(zt) - f'(0)|\\,|z|\\,dt.$$\nFor $d \\in D$ we have by Cauchy's integral formula\n$$f'(d) - f'(0) = \\frac{d}{2\\pi i} \\int_{|w|= r} \\frac{f'(w)}{w(w-d)} \\,dw,$$\nhence\n$$|f'(d) - f(0)| \\leq \\frac{|d|}{r - |d|} C$$\nand thus\n$$|A(z)| \\leq \\int_{0}^{1} \\left(\\frac{|zt|}{r - |zt|}C\\right)|z|\\,dt \\leq \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{|z|^2}{r - |z|} C.$$\nLet $x = |z| \\in (0,r)$ and observe that $|f(z) - f'(0)z| \\geq |f'(0)| x - |f(z)|$. The last inequality together with the hypothesis $C \\leq 2 |f'(0)|$ gives\n$$|f(z)| \\geq \\underbrace{\\left(x - \\frac{x^2}{r- x}\\right)}_{h(x)} |f'(0)|.$$\nNow $h(x)$ assumes its maximum $(3 - 2\\sqrt{2})r$ at the point $\\tilde{x} = (1-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2})r$. Thus we have shown that for $|z| = \\tilde{x}$ we have\n$$|f(z)| \\geq (3 - 2\\sqrt{2})\\cdot r \\cdot |f'(0)| = \\rho.$$\nBut this implies that $B_{\\rho}(f(0)) \\supset f(B_{\\tilde{x}}(0))$. Why? This is because $B_{\\tilde{x}}(0)$ is a domain whose boundary is mapped outside the ball $B_{\\rho}(f(0))$ by $f$, as $f(0) = 0$, see here (1) at the bottom of the page for more details. Proof of Bloch's theorem. Assume that $f$ is holomorphic in a neighborhood of the closed unit disk and assume that $f'(0) = 1$. Consider the function $z \\mapsto |f'(z)|(1-|z|)$. It takes on its maximum at some point $p \\in \\mathbb{D}$. Putting $t = \\frac{1}{2}(1-|p|)$ we have $B_{t}(p) \\subset \\mathbb{D}$ and $1-|z| \\geq t$ for all $z \\in B_{t}(p)$. Therefore $|f'(z)|(1-|z|) \\leq 2t|f'(p)|$ and hence $|f'(z)| \\leq 2|f'(p)|$ for all $z \\in B_t(p)$. Hence the lemma gives us $B_{\\rho}(f(p)) \\subset f(\\mathbb{D})$ for $\\rho = (3-2\\sqrt{2}) \\frac{1}{2} t |f'(p)| \\geq \\frac{3}{2} - \\sqrt{2}$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me tackle this problem. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows how assumptions and the problem are separated.\n\nLooking at the original question about Picard's Little Theorem, the user is asking about the number of proofs and if there's a simple one. But the example format focuses on extracting assumptions and stating the problem. Wait, the example given for the original problem about A(n) being divisible by 91 had assumptions like n being an integer and divisible by 7. However, in the problem about Picard's theorem, the assumptions would be the conditions required for the theorem to hold.\n\nThe theorem states that if a holomorphic function f maps the complex plane to the complex plane minus two points {a,b}, then f is constant. So the assumptions here are:\n\n1. f is a function from C to C \\ {a, b}.\n2. f is holomorphic.\n3. There exist two distinct complex numbers a and b such that f omits both.\n\nEach of these should be listed line by line. The problem part is the statement of the theorem to prove.\n\nWait, the original question isn't asking to prove the theorem, but the user's example transformed the original problem into a proof request. Hmm, maybe the user wants to extract the theorem's conditions as assumptions and the conclusion as the problem. So, in the case of the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, with assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But in the Picard's theorem case, the theorem itself is the problem to prove, with its hypotheses as assumptions.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- f: C → C \\ {a, b} is a function.\n- f is holomorphic.\n- a and b are two distinct complex numbers.\n\nThe problem is to prove that f is constant.\n\nBut the original question on Math SE is asking about references for proofs and existence of a simple proof, not to prove it. However, the example given by the user took the problem statement and formatted it into assumptions and the problem. Therefore, perhaps the task here is to extract the theorem's conditions as assumptions and the conclusion as the problem, regardless of the actual question asked. Wait, the user's instruction says: \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" So the \"problem\" part is the mathematical problem to solve, not the user's question about references.\n\nTherefore, in the given example, the original question was about proving divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem extracted that. Similarly, here, even though the user is asking about proofs and references, the underlying mathematical problem is Picard's Little Theorem, so the task is to structure that theorem into the assumption and problem format.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are the hypotheses of Picard's theorem, and the problem is the conclusion that f is constant.\n\nSo, breaking down:\n\nAssumptions:\n- f is a holomorphic function from the complex plane C to C \\ {a, b}.\n- a and b are two distinct complex numbers.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f is constant.\n\nBut in the original theorem statement, the function is f: C → C \\ {a, b}, holomorphic. So the assumptions are:\n\n1. f: C → C \\ {a, b} is holomorphic.\n2. a and b are two distinct complex numbers.\n\nEach assumption is one line, one property per object. Then the problem is to prove f is constant.\n\nBut the original question's first line states the theorem, so that's the problem. Therefore, the formatted problem should have assumptions as the theorem's hypotheses and the problem as the conclusion.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a holomorphic function from ℂ to ℂ \\ {a, b},\na and b are distinct complex numbers.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f is constant.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the assumptions were split into two lines: \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". Similarly here, each assumption line should address one property or condition of one object. So \"f is holomorphic\" and \"f maps ℂ to ℂ \\ {a, b}\" are two separate assumptions. Also, \"a and b are distinct complex numbers\" is another assumption. So three assumptions:\n\n1. f is a function from ℂ to ℂ \\ {a, b}.\n2. f is holomorphic.\n3. a and b are distinct complex numbers.\n\nProblem: Prove that f is constant.\n\nYes, that fits the example's structure where each assumption is a single condition.",

This follows from the fact that the derivative of a holomorphic function is holomorphic. Therefore, $f'$ is an entire function.\n\n**Step 2: Define the integrand function**\nConsider the function $h: \\mathbb{C} \\setminus \\{0, d\\} \\to \\mathbb{C}$ defined by\n$$h(w) = \\frac{f'(w)}{w(w-d)}.$$\nSince $f'$ is entire and the denominator $w(w-d)$ is analytic except at $w=0$ and $w=d$, the function $h$ is meromorphic with simple poles at $w=0$ and $w=d$ (provided $f'(0) \\neq 0$ and $f'(d) \\neq 0$; if either is zero, the pole might be of lower order, but the residue calculation will still be valid as shown below).\n\n**Step 3: Choose appropriate contour**\nLet $r > \\max(|d|, 0)$. This ensures that the circle $\\gamma = \\{w \\in \\mathbb{C}: |w| = r\\}$ encloses both points $0$ and $d$ in its interior. The contour $\\gamma$ is positively oriented (counterclockwise).\n\n**Step 4: Apply the residue theorem**\nSince $h$ is meromorphic inside and on $\\gamma$ with isolated singularities at $w=0$ and $w=d$, the residue theorem gives\n$$\\int_{|w|=r} h(w) \\, dw = 2\\pi i \\left[ \\operatorname{Res}(h, 0) + \\operatorname{Res}(h, d) \\right].$$\n\n**Step 5: Compute the residues**\nWe compute the residues at the simple poles:\n\n1. **Residue at $w=0$:**\n   Since $w=0$ is a simple pole of $h$, we have\n   $$\\operatorname{Res}(h, 0) = \\lim_{w \\to 0} w \\cdot h(w) = \\lim_{w \\to 0} w \\cdot \\frac{f'(w)}{w(w-d)} = \\lim_{w \\to 0} \\frac{f'(w)}{w-d} = \\frac{f'(0)}{0-d} = -\\frac{f'(0)}{d}.$$\n   The limit exists because $f'$ is continuous (being holomorphic).\n\n2. **Residue at $w=d$:**\n   Similarly, $w=d$ is a simple pole, so\n   $$\\operatorname{Res}(h, d) = \\lim_{w \\to d} (w-d) \\cdot h(w) = \\lim_{w \\to d} (w-d) \\cdot \\frac{f'(w)}{w(w-d)} = \\lim_{w \\to d} \\frac{f'(w)}{w} = \\frac{f'(d)}{d}.$$\n   Again, the limit exists by continuity of $f'$.\n\n**Step 6: Substitute residues into residue theorem**\nSubstituting the computed residues into the residue theorem formula:\n$$\\int_{|w|=r} \\frac{f'(w)}{w(w-d)} \\, dw = 2\\pi i \\left[ -\\frac{f'(0)}{d} + \\frac{f'(d)}{d} \\right] = \\frac{2\\pi i}{d} \\left[ f'(d) - f'(0) \\right].$$\n\n**Step 7: Rearrange to obtain desired formula**\nMultiplying both sides by $\\frac{d}{2\\pi i}$ gives\n$$\\frac{d}{2\\pi i} \\int_{|w|=r} \\frac{f'(w)}{w(w-d)} \\, dw = f'(d) - f'(0).$$\n\nEquivalently,\n$$f'(d) - f'(0) = \\frac{d}{2\\pi i} \\int_{|w|=r} \\frac{f'(w)}{w(w-d)} \\, dw.$$\n\n**Step 8: Remarks on special cases**\n- If $d = 0$, the formula reduces to $0 = 0$, which is trivially true.\n- If $f'(0) = 0$ or $f'(d) = 0$, the poles at $0$ or $d$ might be removable singularities rather than simple poles. However, the residue calculations above remain valid because the limits still exist and yield the same expressions. For example, if $f'(0)=0$, then $\\operatorname{Res}(h,0) = 0$, which matches $-f'(0)\/d = 0$.\n- The condition $r > \\max(|d|, 0)$ ensures both singularities are inside the contour; any larger $r$ would work as well due to Cauchy's theorem (since $h$ is analytic for $|w| > \\max(|d|, 0)$ except at infinity).\n\n**Conclusion:** We have proved the identity\n$$f'(d) - f'(0) = \\frac{d}{2\\pi i} \\int_{|w|=r} \\frac{f'(w)}{w(w-d)} \\, dw$$\nfor any entire function $f$, any $d \\in \\mathbb{C}$, and any $r > \\max(|d|, 0)$.",
