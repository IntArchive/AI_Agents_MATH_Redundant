We will prove that [F(α):F] = d, and since n = [F(α):F] by definition, it follows that deg Q = d = n.\\n\\nStep 1: Since α is algebraic over F, by definition there exists a nonzero polynomial in F[x] that has α as a root. Among all such polynomials, there is a unique monic polynomial of minimal degree that is irreducible over F; this is called the minimal polynomial of α over F, denoted Q(x). By construction, Q is monic, irreducible over F, and satisfies Q(α) = 0.\\n\\nStep 2: Consider the field extension F(α)/F. The field F(α) consists of all elements that can be expressed as rational functions in α with coefficients in F. Because α is algebraic, every element of F(α) can actually be written as a polynomial in α with coefficients in F. More precisely, F(α) = {f(α) : f(x) ∈ F[x]}.\\n\\nStep 3: We claim that the set B = {1, α, α², …, α^{d-1}} is a basis for F(α) over F. To prove this, we must show that B is linearly independent over F and that B spans F(α) over F.\\n\\nStep 4 (Linear independence): Suppose there exist coefficients a₀, a₁, …, a_{d-1} ∈ F, not all zero, such that\\n\\na₀ + a₁α + a₂α² + ⋯ + a_{d-1}α^{d-1} = 0.\\n\\nDefine the polynomial p(x) = a₀ + a₁x + a₂x² + ⋯ + a_{d-1}x^{d-1} ∈ F[x]. Then p(α) = 0 and deg p ≤ d-1 < d. Since Q is the minimal polynomial of α (the monic polynomial of smallest degree that vanishes at α), the existence of such a nonzero p would contradict the minimality of Q. Therefore, all coefficients must be zero, proving that B is linearly independent over F.\\n\\nStep 5 (Spanning): Let y be any element of F(α). By Step 2, there exists a polynomial f(x) ∈ F[x] such that y = f(α). Perform polynomial division of f(x) by Q(x) in F[x]. Since Q is nonzero, we can write\\n\\nf(x) = Q(x) q(x) + r(x),\\n\\nwhere q(x), r(x) ∈ F[x] and deg r < deg Q = d. Evaluating at x = α gives\\n\\ny = f(α) = Q(α) q(α) + r(α) = 0·q(α) + r(α) = r(α),\\n\\nbecause Q(α) = 0. Since deg r < d, r(x) can be written as r(x) = b₀ + b₁x + ⋯ + b_{d-1}x^{d-1} with b_i ∈ F. Consequently,\\n\\ny = r(α) = b₀ + b₁α + ⋯ + b_{d-1}α^{d-1},\\n\\nwhich is a linear combination of the elements of B. Hence B spans F(α) over F.\\n\\nStep 6: From Steps 4 and 5, B is a basis for F(α) over F. The number of elements in B is d, therefore the dimension of F(α) as a vector space over F is d. By definition, the degree of the field extension F(α)/F is this dimension, i.e.,\\n\\n[F(α):F] = d = deg Q.\\n\\nStep 7: The problem states that n = [F(α):F]. Combining this with the result of Step 6, we obtain\\n\\ndeg Q = d = [F(α):F] = n.\\n\\nThus we have proved that deg Q = n, as required.\"\n}\n###END_OF_FORMAT###"

We will prove that [F(α):F] = d, and since n = [F(α):F] by definition, it follows that deg Q = d = n.\n\nStep 1: Since α is algebraic over F, by definition there exists a nonzero polynomial in F[x] that has α as a root. Among all such polynomials, there is a unique monic polynomial of minimal degree that is irreducible over F; this is called the minimal polynomial of α over F, denoted Q(x). By construction, Q is monic, irreducible over F, and satisfies Q(α) = 0.\n\nStep 2: Consider the field extension F(α)/F. The field F(α) consists of all elements that can be expressed as rational functions in α with coefficients in F. Because α is algebraic, every element of F(α) can actually be written as a polynomial in α with coefficients in F. More precisely, F(α) = {f(α) : f(x) ∈ F[x]}.\n\nStep 3: We claim that the set B = {1, α, α², …, α^{d-1}} is a basis for F(α) over F. To prove this, we must show that B is linearly independent over F and that B spans F(α) over F.\n\nStep 4 (Linear independence): Suppose there exist coefficients a₀, a₁, …, a_{d-1} ∈ F, not all zero, such that\n\na₀ + a₁α + a₂α² + ⋯ + a_{d-1}α^{d-1} = 0.\n\nDefine the polynomial p(x) = a₀ + a₁x + a₂x² + ⋯ + a_{d-1}x^{d-1} ∈ F[x]. Then p(α) = 0 and deg p ≤ d-1 < d. Since Q is the minimal polynomial of α (the monic polynomial of smallest degree that vanishes at α), the existence of such a nonzero p would contradict the minimality of Q. Therefore, all coefficients must be zero, proving that B is linearly independent over F.\n\nStep 5 (Spanning): Let y be any element of F(α). By Step 2, there exists a polynomial f(x) ∈ F[x] such that y = f(α). Perform polynomial division of f(x) by Q(x) in F[x]. Since Q is nonzero, we can write\n\nf(x) = Q(x) q(x) + r(x),\n\nwhere q(x), r(x) ∈ F[x] and deg r < deg Q = d. Evaluating at x = α gives\n\ny = f(α) = Q(α) q(α) + r(α) = 0·q(α) + r(α) = r(α),\n\nbecause Q(α) = 0. Since deg r < d, r(x) can be written as r(x) = b₀ + b₁x + ⋯ + b_{d-1}x^{d-1} with b_i ∈ F. Consequently,\n\ny = r(α) = b₀ + b₁α + ⋯ + b_{d-1}α^{d-1},\n\nwhich is a linear combination of the elements of B. Hence B spans F(α) over F.\n\nStep 6: From Steps 4 and 5, B is a basis for F(α) over F. The number of elements in B is d, therefore the dimension of F(α) as a vector space over F is d. By definition, the degree of the field extension F(α)/F is this dimension, i.e.,\n\n[F(α):F] = d = deg Q.\n\nStep 7: The problem states that n = [F(α):F]. Combining this with the result of Step 6, we obtain\n\ndeg Q = d = [F(α):F] = n.\n\nThus we have proved that deg Q = n, as required.",
