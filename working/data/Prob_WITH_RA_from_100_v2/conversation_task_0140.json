Since a separable metric space contains a countable dense subset, and an uncountable set with pairwise distances bounded below by 1 cannot be approximated by a countable set, this will establish that $C_b(\\\\mathbb{R})$ is not separable.\\n\\n**Step 1: Construction of the function family**\\n\\nFor each $t \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}$, define the function $f_t: \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}$ by\\n\\\\[ f_t(x) = \\\\max(0, 1 - |x - t|). \\\\]\\nThis is a triangular bump function centered at $t$ with height 1 and support $[t-1, t+1]$. Specifically:\\n- $f_t(t) = 1$,\\n- $f_t(x)$ decreases linearly to 0 as $|x-t|$ increases from 0 to 1,\\n- $f_t(x) = 0$ for $|x-t| \\\\geq 1$.\\n\\nEach $f_t$ is continuous (as the maximum of continuous functions) and bounded (since $0 \\\\leq f_t(x) \\\\leq 1$ for all $x$). Thus $f_t \\\\in C_b(\\\\mathbb{R})$ for every $t \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}$.\\n\\nLet $S = \\\\{f_t : t \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}\\\\}$. Since $\\\\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable, $S$ is an uncountable subset of $C_b(\\\\mathbb{R})$.\\n\\n**Step 2: Distance between distinct functions in $S$**\\n\\nWe need to show that for any distinct $t_1, t_2 \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}$ with $t_1 \\\\neq t_2$, we have $\\\\|f_{t_1} - f_{t_2}\\\\| \\\\geq 1$.\\n\\nRecall that the supremum norm is defined as $\\\\|f\\\\| = \\\\sup_{x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}} |f(x)|$. We consider two cases based on the distance between $t_1$ and $t_2$.\\n\\n**Case 1: $|t_1 - t_2| \\\\geq 2$.**\\n\\nIn this case, the supports of $f_{t_1}$ and $f_{t_2}$ are disjoint: $\\\\operatorname{supp}(f_{t_1}) = [t_1-1, t_1+1]$ and $\\\\operatorname{supp}(f_{t_2}) = [t_2-1, t_2+1]$, and these intervals do not intersect when $|t_1 - t_2| \\\\geq 2$. Therefore, for any $x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}$, at most one of $f_{t_1}(x)$ and $f_{t_2}(x)$ is nonzero. In particular:\\n- At $x = t_1$, we have $f_{t_1}(t_1) = 1$ and $f_{t_2}(t_1) = 0$ (since $|t_1 - t_2| \\\\geq 2$ implies $|t_1 - t_2| > 1$, so $t_1$ is outside the support of $f_{t_2}$).\\n- Thus $|f_{t_1}(t_1) - f_{t_2}(t_1)| = |1 - 0| = 1$.\\n\\nHence $\\\\|f_{t_1} - f_{t_2}\\\\| \\\\geq 1$. In fact, since the functions are nonnegative and have disjoint supports, we have $\\\\|f_{t_1} - f_{t_2}\\\\| = 1$.\\n\\n**Case 2: $|t_1 - t_2| < 2$.**\\n\\nWithout loss of generality, assume $t_1 < t_2$. Consider the midpoint $m = \\\\frac{t_1 + t_2}{2}$. We will evaluate $|f_{t_1}(m) - f_{t_2}(m)|$.\\n\\nSince $f_{t_1}$ is linear on $[t_1, t_1+1]$ and $f_{t_2}$ is linear on $[t_2-1, t_2]$, we compute:\\n\\\\[ f_{t_1}(m) = \\\\max(0, 1 - |m - t_1|) = 1 - (m - t_1) = 1 - \\\\frac{t_2 - t_1}{2}, \\\\]\\n\\\\[ f_{t_2}(m) = \\\\max(0, 1 - |m - t_2|) = 1 - (t_2 - m) = 1 - \\\\frac{t_2 - t_1}{2}. \\\\]\\n\\nThus $f_{t_1}(m) = f_{t_2}(m) = 1 - \\\\frac{|t_1 - t_2|}{2}$. This does not immediately give a lower bound of 1. However, we need to consider the supremum over all $x$, not just at the midpoint.\\n\\nConsider $x = t_1$. Then:\\n\\\\[ f_{t_1}(t_1) = 1, \\\\]\\n\\\\[ f_{t_2}(t_1) = \\\\max(0, 1 - |t_1 - t_2|) = 1 - |t_1 - t_2| \\\\quad \\\\text{(since $|t_1 - t_2| < 2$ implies $|t_1 - t_2| < 1$ or not? Actually careful: if $|t_1 - t_2| < 2$, it could be $\\\\geq 1$)}. \\\\]\\n\\nIf $|t_1 - t_2| \\\\geq 1$, then $f_{t_2}(t_1) = 0$ (since $1 - |t_1 - t_2| \\\\leq 0$), so $|f_{t_1}(t_1) - f_{t_2}(t_1)| = 1$.\\n\\nIf $|t_1 - t_2| < 1$, then $f_{t_2}(t_1) = 1 - |t_1 - t_2| > 0$, so\\n\\\\[ |f_{t_1}(t_1) - f_{t_2}(t_1)| = 1 - (1 - |t_1 - t_2|) = |t_1 - t_2|. \\\\]\\nThis is less than 1. But we need to find some $x$ where the difference is at least 1. Consider $x = t_2$:\\n\\\\[ f_{t_1}(t_2) = \\\\max(0, 1 - |t_2 - t_1|) = 1 - |t_1 - t_2|, \\\\]\\n\\\\[ f_{t_2}(t_2) = 1. \\\\]\\nThus $|f_{t_1}(t_2) - f_{t_2}(t_2)| = 1 - (1 - |t_1 - t_2|) = |t_1 - t_2|$ again.\\n\\nWe need a more careful analysis. Actually, the claim that $\\\\|f_{t_1} - f_{t_2}\\\\| \\\\geq 1$ for all distinct $t_1, t_2$ is not true with the given definition of $f_t$. For example, if $t_1$ and $t_2$ are very close, say $|t_1 - t_2| = 0.1$, then the functions are nearly identical and their supremum difference is about 0.1, not 1.\\n\\nHowever, we can modify the construction to ensure the desired property. Instead of taking all $t \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}$, we can take an uncountable subset $T \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R}$ such that any two distinct elements of $T$ are at distance at least 2 apart. For example, take $T = \\\\{2k : k \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}\\\\}$? That's countable. We need an uncountable set with pairwise distances at least 2. Such sets exist: for instance, take a Vitali set or use the fact that $\\\\mathbb{R}$ can be partitioned into uncountably many disjoint intervals of length 2. More concretely, consider $T = \\\\{2r : r \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}\\\\}$? That's just $\\\\mathbb{R}$ scaled by 2, still with arbitrary distances.\\n\\nActually, we need an uncountable set where any two distinct points are at least 2 apart. This is impossible in $\\\\mathbb{R}$ with the usual metric because if we have an uncountable set, it must have accumulation points, so we can find points arbitrarily close. Therefore, we cannot have an uncountable subset of $\\\\mathbb{R}$ with pairwise distances bounded below by a positive constant.\\n\\nWait, this suggests the original proof sketch may have an issue. Let me re-examine: The standard proof that $C_b(\\\\mathbb{R})$ is not separable typically uses an uncountable family of functions with disjoint supports. To have disjoint supports, we need centers at least 2 apart. But as argued, we cannot have an uncountable set of real numbers with pairwise distances at least 2. However, we can take an uncountable set of functions with *almost* disjoint supports, or use a different construction.\\n\\nLet me recall: The standard proof uses functions of the form $f_t(x) = \\\\sin(tx)$ or $f_t(x) = e^{itx}$, but those are not bounded in sup norm? Actually $\\\\sin(tx)$ is bounded but not useful for separation. Another approach: use characteristic functions of singletons, but those are not continuous.\\n\\nActually, the triangular bump function construction works if we restrict to a well-chosen uncountable set. While we cannot have an uncountable subset of $\\\\mathbb{R}$ with pairwise distances at least 2, we can have an uncountable set where the distances are at least some $\\\\delta > 0$? No, same issue: any uncountable subset of $\\\\mathbb{R}$ has accumulation points.\\n\\nThis suggests we need a different construction. Let me think: The space $C_b(\\\\mathbb{R})$ is indeed not separable. One proof uses the functions $f_t(x) = \\\\mathbf{1}_{[t,\\\\infty)}(x)$ (indicator functions), but those are not continuous. To make them continuous, we can use smoothed versions. Alternatively, consider functions that are 1 on $(-\\\\infty, t]$ and 0 on $[t+1, \\\\infty)$ with a linear transition on $[t, t+1]$. For distinct $t_1 < t_2$, the difference $\\\\|f_{t_1} - f_{t_2}\\\\| = 1$ because at $x = t_2$, $f_{t_1}(t_2) = 0$ (if $t_2 > t_1+1$) and $f_{t_2}(t_2) = 1$. But if we take $t_1$ and $t_2$ close, the difference may be less than 1.\\n\\nTo fix this, we can choose $t$ from an uncountable set where any two are at least 1 apart. But as argued, we cannot have an uncountable subset of $\\\\mathbb{R}$ with pairwise distances at least 1. However, we can use a set like $\\\\mathbb{Z}$ which is countable, or a set like $\\\\{n\\\\sqrt{2} \\\\mod 1 : n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}\\\\}$ which is dense, not separated.\\n\\nWait, perhaps the original proof sketch is correct if we interpret it differently. Let me re-read: \\\"For any distinct $t_1, t_2 \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}$ with $|t_1 - t_2| \\\\ge 2$, we have $\\\\|f_{t_1} - f_{t_2}\\\\| = 1$\\\". This is true. Then: \\\"For $|t_1 - t_2| < 2$, consider the point $x = t_1$. Then $f_{t_1}(t_1) = 1$ and $f_{t_2}(t_1) \\\\le 1 - |t_1 - t_2|/2 < 1$, so $|f_{t_1}(t_1) - f_{t_2}(t_1)| > 0$. More careful analysis shows $\\\\|f_{t_1} - f_{t_2}\\\\| \\\\ge 1$ for all distinct $t_1, t_2$.\\\"\\n\\nThis last claim that $\\\\|f_{t_1} - f_{t_2}\\\\| \\\\ge 1$ for all distinct $t_1, t_2$ is false as we saw. For $t_1$ and $t_2$ very close, the difference is small. So the proof sketch has an error.\\n\\nLet me correct the proof. We need to construct an uncountable family $S$ such that any two distinct functions in $S$ are at distance at least 1. One way is to take $S = \\\\{f_t : t \\\\in T\\\\}$ where $T$ is an uncountable subset of $\\\\mathbb{R}$ with the property that $|t_1 - t_2| \\\\geq 2$ for all distinct $t_1, t_2 \\\\in T$. But as argued, such $T$ cannot exist because any uncountable subset of $\\\\mathbb{R}$ has accumulation points.\\n\\nHowever, we can use a different construction. Consider functions $g_t(x) = \\\\sin(tx)$ for $t > 0$. These are bounded continuous functions. For distinct $t_1 \\\\neq t_2$, we have $\\\\|g_{t_1} - g_{t_2}\\\\| = \\\\sup_{x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}} |\\\\sin(t_1x) - \\\\sin(t_2x)|$. This supremum is 2 (achieved when $\\\\sin(t_1x) = 1$ and $\\\\sin(t_2x) = -1$ or vice versa). Actually, $|\\\\sin(t_1x) - \\\\sin(t_2x)| \\\\leq 2$, and it can approach 2 for appropriate $x$. So $\\\\|g_{t_1} - g_{t_2}\\\\| = 2$ for distinct $t_1, t_2$. The set $\\\\{g_t : t > 0\\\\}$ is uncountable, and any two distinct functions are at distance 2. This works!\\n\\nLet me verify: For distinct $t_1, t_2 > 0$, we want to find $x$ such that $\\\\sin(t_1x) = 1$ and $\\\\sin(t_2x) = -1$. This requires $t_1x = \\\\pi/2 + 2m\\\\pi$ and $t_2x = -\\\\pi/2 + 2n\\\\pi$ for integers $m,n$. Solving: $x = (\\\\pi/2 + 2m\\\\pi)/t_1 = (-\\\\pi/2 + 2n\\\\pi)/t_2$. This gives a linear equation in $m,n$. For irrational $t_1/t_2$, we can approximate such $m,n$. Actually, we may not get exactly 1 and -1 simultaneously, but we can get arbitrarily close to difference 2. So $\\\\|g_{t_1} - g_{t_2}\\\\| = 2$.\\n\\nThus, using $g_t(x) = \\\\sin(tx)$, we have an uncountable family $S = \\\\{g_t : t \\\\in (0,\\\\infty)\\\\}$ with $\\\\|g_{t_1} - g_{t_2}\\\\| = 2$ for all distinct $t_1, t_2$. This satisfies the required property that any two distinct functions are at distance at least 1 (in fact, exactly 2).\\n\\nNow we can complete the proof:\\n\\n**Corrected Proof:**\\n\\n1. For each $t > 0$, define $g_t(x) = \\\\sin(tx)$. Each $g_t$ is bounded (since $|\\\\sin(tx)| \\\\leq 1$) and continuous, so $g_t \\\\in C_b(\\\\mathbb{R})$.\\n\\n2. Let $S = \\\\{g_t : t > 0\\\\}$. Since $(0,\\\\infty)$ is uncountable, $S$ is an uncountable subset of $C_b(\\\\mathbb{R})$.\\n\\n3. For any distinct $t_1, t_2 > 0$ with $t_1 \\\\neq t_2$, we claim $\\\\|g_{t_1} - g_{t_2}\\\\| = 2$. To see this, note that $|\\\\sin(t_1x) - \\\\sin(t_2x)| \\\\leq 2$ for all $x$. We show the supremum is 2 by constructing a sequence $(x_n)$ such that $|\\\\sin(t_1x_n) - \\\\sin(t_2x_n)| \\\\to 2$. Consider sequences $x_n$ such that $\\\\sin(t_1x_n) \\\\to 1$ and $\\\\sin(t_2x_n) \\\\to -1$. Such sequences exist because the set $\\\\{(\\\\sin(t_1x), \\\\sin(t_2x)) : x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}\\\\}$ is dense in $[-1,1]^2$ when $t_1/t_2$ is irrational (by Kronecker's theorem). Even if $t_1/t_2$ is rational, we can still approach difference 2. Thus $\\\\|g_{t_"

Since a separable metric space contains a countable dense subset, and an uncountable set with pairwise distances bounded below by 1 cannot be approximated by a countable set, this will establish that $C_b(\\\\mathbb{R})$ is not separable.\\n\\n**Step 1: Construction of the function family**\\n\\nFor each $t \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}$, define the function $f_t: \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}$ by\\n\\\\[ f_t(x) = \\\\max(0, 1 - |x - t|). \\\\]\\nThis is a triangular bump function centered at $t$ with height 1 and support $[t-1, t+1]$. Specifically:\\n- $f_t(t) = 1$,\\n- $f_t(x)$ decreases linearly to 0 as $|x-t|$ increases from 0 to 1,\\n- $f_t(x) = 0$ for $|x-t| \\\\geq 1$.\\n\\nEach $f_t$ is continuous (as the maximum of continuous functions) and bounded (since $0 \\\\leq f_t(x) \\\\leq 1$ for all $x$). Thus $f_t \\\\in C_b(\\\\mathbb{R})$ for every $t \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}$.\\n\\nLet $S = \\\\{f_t : t \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}\\\\}$. Since $\\\\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable, $S$ is an uncountable subset of $C_b(\\\\mathbb{R})$.\\n\\n**Step 2: Distance between distinct functions in $S$**\\n\\nWe need to show that for any distinct $t_1, t_2 \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}$ with $t_1 \\\\neq t_2$, we have $\\\\|f_{t_1} - f_{t_2}\\\\| \\\\geq 1$.\\n\\nRecall that the supremum norm is defined as $\\\\|f\\\\| = \\\\sup_{x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}} |f(x)|$. We consider two cases based on the distance between $t_1$ and $t_2$.\\n\\n**Case 1: $|t_1 - t_2| \\\\geq 2$.**\\n\\nIn this case, the supports of $f_{t_1}$ and $f_{t_2}$ are disjoint: $\\\\operatorname{supp}(f_{t_1}) = [t_1-1, t_1+1]$ and $\\\\operatorname{supp}(f_{t_2}) = [t_2-1, t_2+1]$, and these intervals do not intersect when $|t_1 - t_2| \\\\geq 2$. Therefore, for any $x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}$, at most one of $f_{t_1}(x)$ and $f_{t_2}(x)$ is nonzero. In particular:\\n- At $x = t_1$, we have $f_{t_1}(t_1) = 1$ and $f_{t_2}(t_1) = 0$ (since $|t_1 - t_2| \\\\geq 2$ implies $|t_1 - t_2| > 1$, so $t_1$ is outside the support of $f_{t_2}$).\\n- Thus $|f_{t_1}(t_1) - f_{t_2}(t_1)| = |1 - 0| = 1$.\\n\\nHence $\\\\|f_{t_1} - f_{t_2}\\\\| \\\\geq 1$. In fact, since the functions are nonnegative and have disjoint supports, we have $\\\\|f_{t_1} - f_{t_2}\\\\| = 1$.\\n\\n**Case 2: $|t_1 - t_2| < 2$.**\\n\\nWithout loss of generality, assume $t_1 < t_2$. Consider the midpoint $m = \\\\frac{t_1 + t_2}{2}$. We will evaluate $|f_{t_1}(m) - f_{t_2}(m)|$.\\n\\nSince $f_{t_1}$ is linear on $[t_1, t_1+1]$ and $f_{t_2}$ is linear on $[t_2-1, t_2]$, we compute:\\n\\\\[ f_{t_1}(m) = \\\\max(0, 1 - |m - t_1|) = 1 - (m - t_1) = 1 - \\\\frac{t_2 - t_1}{2}, \\\\]\\n\\\\[ f_{t_2}(m) = \\\\max(0, 1 - |m - t_2|) = 1 - (t_2 - m) = 1 - \\\\frac{t_2 - t_1}{2}. \\\\]\\n\\nThus $f_{t_1}(m) = f_{t_2}(m) = 1 - \\\\frac{|t_1 - t_2|}{2}$. This does not immediately give a lower bound of 1. However, we need to consider the supremum over all $x$, not just at the midpoint.\\n\\nConsider $x = t_1$. Then:\\n\\\\[ f_{t_1}(t_1) = 1, \\\\]\\n\\\\[ f_{t_2}(t_1) = \\\\max(0, 1 - |t_1 - t_2|) = 1 - |t_1 - t_2| \\\\quad \\\\text{(since $|t_1 - t_2| < 2$ implies $|t_1 - t_2| < 1$ or not? Actually careful: if $|t_1 - t_2| < 2$, it could be $\\\\geq 1$)}. \\\\]\\n\\nIf $|t_1 - t_2| \\\\geq 1$, then $f_{t_2}(t_1) = 0$ (since $1 - |t_1 - t_2| \\\\leq 0$), so $|f_{t_1}(t_1) - f_{t_2}(t_1)| = 1$.\\n\\nIf $|t_1 - t_2| < 1$, then $f_{t_2}(t_1) = 1 - |t_1 - t_2| > 0$, so\\n\\\\[ |f_{t_1}(t_1) - f_{t_2}(t_1)| = 1 - (1 - |t_1 - t_2|) = |t_1 - t_2|. \\\\]\\nThis is less than 1. But we need to find some $x$ where the difference is at least 1. Consider $x = t_2$:\\n\\\\[ f_{t_1}(t_2) = \\\\max(0, 1 - |t_2 - t_1|) = 1 - |t_1 - t_2|, \\\\]\\n\\\\[ f_{t_2}(t_2) = 1. \\\\]\\nThus $|f_{t_1}(t_2) - f_{t_2}(t_2)| = 1 - (1 - |t_1 - t_2|) = |t_1 - t_2|$ again.\\n\\nWe need a more careful analysis. Actually, the claim that $\\\\|f_{t_1} - f_{t_2}\\\\| \\\\geq 1$ for all distinct $t_1, t_2$ is not true with the given definition of $f_t$. For example, if $t_1$ and $t_2$ are very close, say $|t_1 - t_2| = 0.1$, then the functions are nearly identical and their supremum difference is about 0.1, not 1.\\n\\nHowever, we can modify the construction to ensure the desired property. Instead of taking all $t \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}$, we can take an uncountable subset $T \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R}$ such that any two distinct elements of $T$ are at distance at least 2 apart. For example, take $T = \\\\{2k : k \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}\\\\}$? That's countable. We need an uncountable set with pairwise distances at least 2. Such sets exist: for instance, take a Vitali set or use the fact that $\\\\mathbb{R}$ can be partitioned into uncountably many disjoint intervals of length 2. More concretely, consider $T = \\\\{2r : r \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}\\\\}$? That's just $\\\\mathbb{R}$ scaled by 2, still with arbitrary distances.\\n\\nActually, we need an uncountable set where any two distinct points are at least 2 apart. This is impossible in $\\\\mathbb{R}$ with the usual metric because if we have an uncountable set, it must have accumulation points, so we can find points arbitrarily close. Therefore, we cannot have an uncountable subset of $\\\\mathbb{R}$ with pairwise distances bounded below by a positive constant.\\n\\nWait, this suggests the original proof sketch may have an issue. Let me re-examine: The standard proof that $C_b(\\\\mathbb{R})$ is not separable typically uses an uncountable family of functions with disjoint supports. To have disjoint supports, we need centers at least 2 apart. But as argued, we cannot have an uncountable set of real numbers with pairwise distances at least 2. However, we can take an uncountable set of functions with *almost* disjoint supports, or use a different construction.\\n\\nLet me recall: The standard proof uses functions of the form $f_t(x) = \\\\sin(tx)$ or $f_t(x) = e^{itx}$, but those are not bounded in sup norm? Actually $\\\\sin(tx)$ is bounded but not useful for separation. Another approach: use characteristic functions of singletons, but those are not continuous.\\n\\nActually, the triangular bump function construction works if we restrict to a well-chosen uncountable set. While we cannot have an uncountable subset of $\\\\mathbb{R}$ with pairwise distances at least 2, we can have an uncountable set where the distances are at least some $\\\\delta > 0$? No, same issue: any uncountable subset of $\\\\mathbb{R}$ has accumulation points.\\n\\nThis suggests we need a different construction. Let me think: The space $C_b(\\\\mathbb{R})$ is indeed not separable. One proof uses the functions $f_t(x) = \\\\mathbf{1}_{[t,\\\\infty)}(x)$ (indicator functions), but those are not continuous. To make them continuous, we can use smoothed versions. Alternatively, consider functions that are 1 on $(-\\\\infty, t]$ and 0 on $[t+1, \\\\infty)$ with a linear transition on $[t, t+1]$. For distinct $t_1 < t_2$, the difference $\\\\|f_{t_1} - f_{t_2}\\\\| = 1$ because at $x = t_2$, $f_{t_1}(t_2) = 0$ (if $t_2 > t_1+1$) and $f_{t_2}(t_2) = 1$. But if we take $t_1$ and $t_2$ close, the difference may be less than 1.\\n\\nTo fix this, we can choose $t$ from an uncountable set where any two are at least 1 apart. But as argued, we cannot have an uncountable subset of $\\\\mathbb{R}$ with pairwise distances at least 1. However, we can use a set like $\\\\mathbb{Z}$ which is countable, or a set like $\\\\{n\\\\sqrt{2} \\\\mod 1 : n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}\\\\}$ which is dense, not separated.\\n\\nWait, perhaps the original proof sketch is correct if we interpret it differently. Let me re-read: \\\"For any distinct $t_1, t_2 \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}$ with $|t_1 - t_2| \\\\ge 2$, we have $\\\\|f_{t_1} - f_{t_2}\\\\| = 1$\\\". This is true. Then: \\\"For $|t_1 - t_2| < 2$, consider the point $x = t_1$. Then $f_{t_1}(t_1) = 1$ and $f_{t_2}(t_1) \\\\le 1 - |t_1 - t_2|/2 < 1$, so $|f_{t_1}(t_1) - f_{t_2}(t_1)| > 0$. More careful analysis shows $\\\\|f_{t_1} - f_{t_2}\\\\| \\\\ge 1$ for all distinct $t_1, t_2$.\\\"\\n\\nThis last claim that $\\\\|f_{t_1} - f_{t_2}\\\\| \\\\ge 1$ for all distinct $t_1, t_2$ is false as we saw. For $t_1$ and $t_2$ very close, the difference is small. So the proof sketch has an error.\\n\\nLet me correct the proof. We need to construct an uncountable family $S$ such that any two distinct functions in $S$ are at distance at least 1. One way is to take $S = \\\\{f_t : t \\\\in T\\\\}$ where $T$ is an uncountable subset of $\\\\mathbb{R}$ with the property that $|t_1 - t_2| \\\\geq 2$ for all distinct $t_1, t_2 \\\\in T$. But as argued, such $T$ cannot exist because any uncountable subset of $\\\\mathbb{R}$ has accumulation points.\\n\\nHowever, we can use a different construction. Consider functions $g_t(x) = \\\\sin(tx)$ for $t > 0$. These are bounded continuous functions. For distinct $t_1 \\\\neq t_2$, we have $\\\\|g_{t_1} - g_{t_2}\\\\| = \\\\sup_{x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}} |\\\\sin(t_1x) - \\\\sin(t_2x)|$. This supremum is 2 (achieved when $\\\\sin(t_1x) = 1$ and $\\\\sin(t_2x) = -1$ or vice versa). Actually, $|\\\\sin(t_1x) - \\\\sin(t_2x)| \\\\leq 2$, and it can approach 2 for appropriate $x$. So $\\\\|g_{t_1} - g_{t_2}\\\\| = 2$ for distinct $t_1, t_2$. The set $\\\\{g_t : t > 0\\\\}$ is uncountable, and any two distinct functions are at distance 2. This works!\\n\\nLet me verify: For distinct $t_1, t_2 > 0$, we want to find $x$ such that $\\\\sin(t_1x) = 1$ and $\\\\sin(t_2x) = -1$. This requires $t_1x = \\\\pi/2 + 2m\\\\pi$ and $t_2x = -\\\\pi/2 + 2n\\\\pi$ for integers $m,n$. Solving: $x = (\\\\pi/2 + 2m\\\\pi)/t_1 = (-\\\\pi/2 + 2n\\\\pi)/t_2$. This gives a linear equation in $m,n$. For irrational $t_1/t_2$, we can approximate such $m,n$. Actually, we may not get exactly 1 and -1 simultaneously, but we can get arbitrarily close to difference 2. So $\\\\|g_{t_1} - g_{t_2}\\\\| = 2$.\\n\\nThus, using $g_t(x) = \\\\sin(tx)$, we have an uncountable family $S = \\\\{g_t : t \\\\in (0,\\\\infty)\\\\}$ with $\\\\|g_{t_1} - g_{t_2}\\\\| = 2$ for all distinct $t_1, t_2$. This satisfies the required property that any two distinct functions are at distance at least 1 (in fact, exactly 2).\\n\\nNow we can complete the proof:\\n\\n**Corrected Proof:**\\n\\n1. For each $t > 0$, define $g_t(x) = \\\\sin(tx)$. Each $g_t$ is bounded (since $|\\\\sin(tx)| \\\\leq 1$) and continuous, so $g_t \\\\in C_b(\\\\mathbb{R})$.\\n\\n2. Let $S = \\\\{g_t : t > 0\\\\}$. Since $(0,\\\\infty)$ is uncountable, $S$ is an uncountable subset of $C_b(\\\\mathbb{R})$.\\n\\n3. For any distinct $t_1, t_2 > 0$ with $t_1 \\\\neq t_2$, we claim $\\\\|g_{t_1} - g_{t_2}\\\\| = 2$. To see this, note that $|\\\\sin(t_1x) - \\\\sin(t_2x)| \\\\leq 2$ for all $x$. We show the supremum is 2 by constructing a sequence $(x_n)$ such that $|\\\\sin(t_1x_n) - \\\\sin(t_2x_n)| \\\\to 2$. Consider sequences $x_n$ such that $\\\\sin(t_1x_n) \\\\to 1$ and $\\\\sin(t_2x_n) \\\\to -1$. Such sequences exist because the set $\\\\{(\\\\sin(t_1x), \\\\sin(t_2x)) : x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}\\\\}$ is dense in $[-1,1]^2$ when $t_1/t_2$ is irrational (by Kronecker's theorem). Even if $t_1/t_2$ is rational, we can still approach difference 2. Thus $\\\\|g_{t_",
