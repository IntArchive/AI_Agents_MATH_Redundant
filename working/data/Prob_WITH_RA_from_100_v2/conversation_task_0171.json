Consider the remainders when dividing 1 by N using long division. After each step, the remainder is an integer between 0 and N−1. By the pigeonhole principle, among the first N+1 remainders, two must be equal. This causes the decimal digits to repeat from that point onward, so the expansion cannot terminate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWe have shown both directions: (⇒) N = 2^a 5^b implies 1/N terminates, and (⇐) 1/N terminates implies N = 2^a 5^b. Hence, the condition N = 2^a 5^b is both necessary and sufficient for 1/N to have a terminating decimal expansion.",
