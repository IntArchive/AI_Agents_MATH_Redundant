Conversely, if $n > \\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon}$, then $\\\\frac{1}{n} < \\\\epsilon$.\\n\\n**Step 4: Choose $N$**\\nGiven any $\\epsilon > 0$, we need to find a natural number $N$ such that for all $n > N$, we have $n > \\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon}$.\\nLet $N$ be any natural number greater than $\\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon}$. Such an $N$ exists by the Archimedean property of real numbers, which states that for any real number $x$, there exists a natural number $m$ such that $m > x$. Here, $x = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon}$.\\n\\n**Step 5: Verify the condition**\\nFor any $n > N$, we have:\\n$$n > N > \\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon}$$\\nTherefore:\\n$$\\\\frac{1}{n} < \\\\frac{1}{\\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon}} = \\\\epsilon$$\\nThus:\\n$$\\\\left|\\\\frac{1}{n} - 0\\\\right| = \\\\frac{1}{n} < \\\\epsilon$$\\n\\n**Step 6: Conclusion**\\nWe have shown that for every $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a natural number $N$ (specifically, any $N > \\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon}$) such that for all $n > N$, $\\\\left|\\\\frac{1}{n} - 0\\\\right| < \\\\epsilon$.\\nBy the definition of the limit of a sequence, this proves that:\\n$$\\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\frac{1}{n} = 0$$\\n\\n**Additional notes:**\\n1. The proof relies on the Archimedean property of real numbers to guarantee the existence of $N$.\\n2. The choice $N = \\\\lfloor \\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon} \\\\rfloor + 1$ is a specific valid choice, where $\\\\lfloor x \\\\rfloor$ denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$.\\n3. The proof is complete and rigorous, following the standard epsilon-N definition of limits for sequences.\"\n}",
