This means that for every ε > 0, there exists N ∈ ℕ such that for all m, n ≥ N, we have ||f_m - f_n||_{C^1} < ε.\\n\\nStep 1: From Assumption 5, we have the inequality:\\n|f_m(x) - f_n(x)| + |f_m'(x) - f_n'(x)| ≤ sup_{t∈[a,b]}|f_m(t) - f_n(t)| + sup_{t∈[a,b]}|f_m'(t) - f_n'(t)| = ||f_m - f_n||_{C^1} < ε\\nfor all x ∈ [a,b] and for all m, n ≥ N.\\n\\nStep 2: This inequality implies two separate inequalities:\\n(1) |f_m(x) - f_n(x)| < ε for all x ∈ [a,b]\\n(2) |f_m'(x) - f_n'(x)| < ε for all x ∈ [a,b]\\nfor all m, n ≥ N. The first inequality shows that {f_n} is a Cauchy sequence in C([a,b]) with respect to the sup-norm, and the second inequality shows that {f_n'} is also a Cauchy sequence in C([a,b]) with respect to the sup-norm.\\n\\nStep 3: Since C([a,b]) with the sup-norm is complete (a well-known fact), there exist functions f, g ∈ C([a,b]) such that:\\n(1) f_n → f uniformly on [a,b] (i.e., sup_{x∈[a,b]}|f_n(x) - f(x)| → 0 as n → ∞)\\n(2) f_n' → g uniformly on [a,b] (i.e., sup_{x∈[a,b]}|f_n'(x) - g(x)| → 0 as n → ∞)\\n\\nStep 4: We now show that f is differentiable and f' = g.
