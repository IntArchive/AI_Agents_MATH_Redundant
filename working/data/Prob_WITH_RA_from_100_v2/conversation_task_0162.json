We will prove that $3 \\mid n$ (i.e., $n$ is divisible by $3$) if and only if $3 \\mid S(n)$, where $S(n)$ denotes the sum of the decimal digits of $n$.\n\n**Step 1: Decimal representation.**\nWrite $n$ in its decimal (base-10) expansion:\n$$n = a_k \\times 10^k + a_{k-1} \\times 10^{k-1} + \\cdots + a_1 \\times 10 + a_0,$$\nwhere each $a_i$ is an integer digit with $0 \\le a_i \\le 9$, and $a_k \\neq 0$ (since $n$ is positive).\n\n**Step 2: Modular property of $10$.**\nObserve that $10 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, because $10 = 9 + 1$ and $9$ is divisible by $3$. In other words, $10 \\equiv 1 \\ (\\text{mod } 3)$.\n\n**Step 3: Powers of $10$ modulo $3$.**\nUsing the fact that congruence is preserved under multiplication, we have for any non‑negative integer $m$:\n$$10^m \\equiv 1^m \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}.$$\nThus every power of $10$ is congruent to $1$ modulo $3$.\n\n**Step 4: Apply congruence to the decimal expansion.**\nTaking the expansion of $n$ modulo $3$ and using the result of Step 3:\n\\begin{align*}\nn &\\equiv a_k \\times 10^k + a_{k-1} \\times 10^{k-1} + \\cdots + a_1 \\times 10 + a_0 \\pmod{3} \\\\\n  &\\equiv a_k \\times 1 + a_{k-1} \\times 1 + \\cdots + a_1 \\times 1 + a_0 \\pmod{3} \\\\\n  &\\equiv a_k + a_{k-1} + \\cdots + a_1 + a_0 \\pmod{3}.\n\\end{align*}\n\n**Step 5: Interpretation.**\nThe last expression is exactly the sum of the decimal digits of $n$, which we denote by $S(n) = a_k + a_{k-1} + \\cdots + a_1 + a_0$. Hence we have proved\n$$n \\equiv S(n) \\pmod{3}.$$\n\n**Step 6: Divisibility criterion.**\nFrom the congruence $n \\equiv S(n) \\ (\\text{mod } 3)$ we obtain:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item If $3 \\mid n$ (i.e., $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$), then $S(n) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, so $3 \\mid S(n)$.\n\\item Conversely, if $3 \\mid S(n)$ (i.e., $S(n) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$), then $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, so $3 \\mid n$.\n\\end{itemize}\nTherefore $n$ is divisible by $3$ **if and only if** the sum of its decimal digits is divisible by $3$. This completes the proof.\n\n**Remark:** The argument does not depend on the particular digits $a_i$; it relies only on the fact that $10 \\equiv 1 \\ (\\text{mod } 3)$. Consequently the same reasoning shows that a positive integer is divisible by $9$ if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by $9$, because $10 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{9}$ as well.",
