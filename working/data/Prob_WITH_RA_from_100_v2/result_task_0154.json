    "Content":"I have read the following theorem: If $p_1,p_2,\\dots,p_n$ are distinct prime numbers, then$$\\left(\\mathbb Q\\left[\\sqrt p_1,\\dots,\\sqrt p_n\\right]:\\mathbb Q\\right)=2^n.$$ I have tried to prove a more general statement but I have a problem at one point. (I still don't know how to prove the theorem above, too, because I don't know how not to use linear independence, which I do in the more general statement below.)  Could you please help me overcome the obstacle I've encountered? I will post the intended proof and make it clear where I'm having trouble. I want to prove the following statement: Let $n\\geq 1$. The set $B_n:=\\left\\{\\sqrt {p_1^{\\epsilon_1}}\\sqrt {p_2^{\\epsilon_2}}\\cdots\\sqrt {p_n^{\\epsilon_n}}\\,|\\,(\\epsilon_1,\\epsilon_2,\\cdots,\\epsilon_n)\\in\\{0,1\\}^n\\right\\}$ has $2^n$ elements and is a $\\mathbb Q-$basis of $\\mathbb Q\\left[\\sqrt p_1,\\sqrt p_2,\\cdots,\\sqrt p_n\\right].$ The proof will be by induction. For $n=1,$ we have $B_n=\\left\\{1,\\sqrt {p_1}\\right\\}.$ It is clear that $\\sqrt{p_1}\\neq 1,$ so the set has $2=2^1$ elements. It is the basis of $\\mathbb Q[\\sqrt{p_1}]$ because the minimal polynomial of $\\sqrt {p_1}$ over $\\mathbb Q$ has degree $2,$ and there is a theorem that $K[a]$ has $a^0,\\cdots,a^{d-1}$ as a basis, where $d$ is the degree of the minimal polynomial of $a$ over $K$. Suppose the statement is true for $n-1$, where $n\\geq 2.$ We have $$\n\\left(B_n=B_{n-1}\\cup\\sqrt{p_n}B_{n-1}\\right)\\text { and } \\left(B_{n-1}\\cap\\sqrt{p_n}B_{n-1}=\\emptyset\\right),\n$$ which is easy to see. It is also easy to see that $\\operatorname{card}(B_{n-1})=\\operatorname{card}(\\sqrt{p_n}B_{n-1}),$ and therefore $$\n\\operatorname{card}B_{n}=2^n.\n$$ Let $$\n\\sum_{x\\in B_{n}}q_xx=0\n$$ for some $\\{q_x\\}_{x\\in B_n}\\subset\\mathbb Q.$ Let $p(x):=\\sqrt{p_n}x$ for all $x\\in B_{n-1}.$ We have $$\n\\sum_{x\\in B_{n}}q_xx=\\sum_{x\\in B_{n-1}} q_xx+\\sum_{x\\in \\sqrt{p_n}B_{n-1}} q_xx=\\sum_{x\\in B_{n-1}} q_xx+\\sum_{x\\in B_{n-1}} q_{p(x)}\\sqrt{p_n}x.\n$$ Therefore $$\n\\sum_{x\\in B_{n-1}} q_xx=-\\sqrt{p_n}\\sum_{x\\in B_{n-1}} q_{p(x)}x,\\tag1\n$$ and we can make the following division iff $q_{p(x)}\\neq 0$ for all $x\\in B_{n-1}$ (because $B_{n-1}$ is linearly indepentent over $\\mathbb Q$): $$\n\\sqrt{p_n}=-\\frac{\\sum_{x\\in B_{n-1}} q_xx}{\\sum_{x\\in B_{n-1}} q_{p(x)}x},\n$$ The right-hand side belongs to $\\mathbb Q\\left[\\sqrt p_1,\\sqrt p_2,\\cdots,\\sqrt p_{n-1}\\right],$ so we have $$\n\\sqrt{p_n}\\in \\mathbb Q\\left[\\sqrt p_1,\\sqrt p_2,\\cdots,\\sqrt p_{n-1}\\right].\n$$ Therefore we can write $\\sqrt{p_n}$ uniquely in the basis $B_{n-1}$. $$\n\\sqrt{p_n}=\\sum_{y\\in B_{n-1}}c_yy\n$$ for some $\\{c_y\\}_{y\\in B_{n-1}}\\subset \\mathbb Q.$ After squaring this equation we will obtain $$\np_n=\\sum_{y\\in B_{n-1}}c_y^2y^2+2\\sum_{y,z\\in B_{n-1}}c_yc_zyz.\n$$ The last sum must be zero because it is not in $\\mathbb Q$ and because after reducing it, we obtain a representation of $p_n$ in the basis $B_{n-1},$ which is unique. Thus $$p_n=\\sum_{y\\in B_{n-1}}c_y^2y^2.$$ Unfortunately, I can't prove that $c_yc_z$ is always zero. This was my first thought, but clearly there's trouble with the possibility of reductions in\n$$\n\\sum_{y,z\\in B_{n-1}}c_yc_zyz.\n$$ Different pairs $y,z$ may yield the same element of $B_{n-1}$ in the product $yz.$ This happens for example when $y=\\sqrt 5\\sqrt 3,$ $z=\\sqrt 5\\sqrt 2,$ and $y'= \\sqrt 11\\sqrt 2,$ $z'=\\sqrt 11\\sqrt 3$. If it were true that $c_yc_z$ is always zero, I would be able to continue my proof as follows. We would have only one $y_0$ such that $c_{y_0}\\neq 0$ and we'd get $$p_n=c_{y_0}^2y_0^2.$$ Let $c_{y_0}=\\frac kl$. We can write\n$$l^2p_n=k^2y_0^2.$$ But $y_0^2$ is the product of some primes different from $p_n$. Therefore the greatest  power of $p_n$ that divides the right-hand side is even. However, the greatest power of $p_n$ that divides the left-hand side is odd. A contradiction. The contradiction proves that $q_{p(x)}=0$ for all $x\\in B_{n-1}.$ Hence $(1)$ gives us that $$\n\\sum_{x\\in B_{n-1}} q_xx=0\n$$ and linear independence of $B_{n-1}$ gives us that $q_x=0$ for all $x\\in B_{n-1}.$ This gives us that $B_n$ is linearly independent. It generates the whole $\\mathbb Q\\left[\\sqrt p_1,\\sqrt p_2,\\cdots,\\sqrt p_n\\right]$ because $$\n\\mathbb Q\\left[\\sqrt p_1,\\sqrt p_2,\\cdots,\\sqrt p_n\\right]=\\left(\\mathbb Q\\left[\\sqrt p_1,\\sqrt p_2,\\cdots,\\sqrt p_{n-1}\\right]\\right)\\left[\\sqrt{p_n}\\right].\n$$ This would end the proof.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, I need to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question according to the given format. Let me read through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe user is trying to prove that the degree of the field extension Q[√p₁,…,√pₙ] over Q is 2ⁿ, where the p_i are distinct primes. The user attempted a proof by induction using the basis Bₙ, which consists of products of square roots of primes with exponents 0 or 1. The key issue they're facing is in showing that the coefficients c_y and c_z must be zero in the inductive step when they square the expression for √pₙ. They mentioned that different products y*z might result in the same element of B_{n-1}, complicating the argument that the cross terms sum to zero.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. The assumptions should be individual conditions applied to single objects. The problem is the main statement to be proven.\n\nAssumptions here would include that p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ are distinct primes. Also, the induction hypothesis that the statement holds for n-1. The problem is to prove that the set Bₙ is a basis with 2ⁿ elements, leading to the degree of the field extension being 2ⁿ.\n\nWait, in the original problem, the user states two things: the theorem they want to prove (the degree is 2ⁿ) and their approach using the basis Bₙ. The problem they are stuck on is part of their proof attempt, specifically showing linear independence of Bₙ because of the cross terms when squaring √pₙ expressed in terms of B_{n-1}.\n\nBut according to the format example, the \"Problem\" part should be the main question to answer. However, in the example, the user restated the problem from the original, filtering out unnecessary details.\n\nLooking at the user's question, they presented their attempted proof and where they got stuck. However, the main problem they want help with is proving the original theorem (the degree is 2ⁿ) or the specific step in their induction where they can't show c_yc_z=0. But the way the question is written, they start by stating the theorem, then present their attempt, pointing out the obstacle. The actual problem they need help with is part of their proof attempt, but the original theorem is the main problem.\n\nBut according to the instructions, the task is to structure the problem as per the format, listing assumptions and the problem. The example given extracted the key assumptions (n is integer, divisible by 7) and the problem to prove divisibility by 91.\n\nIn the current case, the original problem is to prove that [Q[√p₁,…,√pₙ] : Q] = 2ⁿ. The user's specific obstacle is in their induction step when trying to show linear independence of Bₙ. However, the main problem to structure is the original theorem, not the specific step in their proof. But the user is asking for help with their obstacle in proving the theorem. Hmm.\n\nWait, the user says: \"Could you please help me overcome the obstacle I've encountered? I will post the intended proof and make it clear where I'm having trouble.\" So their problem is the specific step in their proof where they can't show c_yc_z=0. However, the initial problem they want to prove is the degree of the field extension. The example given in the format includes the problem as the main statement, not the step where the user is stuck. So maybe I need to structure the main problem (the theorem) and its assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem here is the step in their proof where they need to show that the sum involving c_yc_z yz must be zero. But the user is trying to prove the main theorem, so the problem should be the theorem statement, with assumptions.\n\nLooking at the original question's title: \"Proving that [Q[√p₁,…,√pₙ] : Q] = 2ⁿ for distinct primes p_i.\" The problem they want to prove is that statement. The user's specific issue is in their proof attempt, but the formatted problem should capture the main theorem. However, the example includes the assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem, that wasn't stated. Wait, the example had an original problem where the user might have added an assumption. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, no: the original example's original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91, but the formatted problem listed an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, which is not correct. Wait, that seems like a mistake. Because the original problem's assumption is just that n is an integer, but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems wrong. But maybe the example was a bad example. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. Let me check.\n\nOriginal problem in example: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so why is the assumption that n is divisible by 7? That seems incorrect. Therefore, maybe the example is wrong. But regardless, I need to follow the format as per the user's instruction.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's original theorem to prove is: [Q[√p₁,…,√pₙ] : Q] = 2ⁿ for distinct primes p_i. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- p₁, p₂, ..., p_n are distinct primes.\n\nThat's the main assumption. The problem is to prove the degree of the field extension is 2ⁿ. However, in the user's proof attempt, they have additional structures, like using induction and the basis B_n. However, the problem to structure should be the main theorem they're trying to prove, not the step in their proof. Unless the user's specific problem is the step in their proof, but according to the example, the problem is the original question's main problem. Therefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption: p₁, p₂, ..., p_n are distinct primes.\n\nProblem: Prove that [Q[√p₁,…,√pₙ] : Q] = 2ⁿ.\n\nBut the user's question also includes their attempt and their specific obstacle. However, the task is to structure the problem as per the format, filtering unrelated information. The user's specific issue in their proof is part of their attempt but not part of the structured problem. The structured problem should be the main theorem. Hence, the formatted problem would list the assumption of distinct primes and the problem to prove the degree.\n\nHowever, in the example, the user added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (n divisible by 7). Wait, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added that assumption. That seems like a mistake. So maybe the example is incorrect. Therefore, maybe the task is to extract the key assumptions from the problem, even if the original problem states them generally. But in the current problem, the key assumption is that the primes are distinct, which is given in the theorem statement. Therefore, the formatted problem should list that as the assumption and the problem as the degree of the extension.",

For each $b$, we must have $c_{b,0} + c_{b,1}\\sqrt{p_n} = 0$.\n\nNow $c_{b,0} + c_{b,1}\\sqrt{p_n} = 0$ with $c_{b,0}, c_{b,1} \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. If $c_{b,1} \\neq 0$, then $\\sqrt{p_n} = -c_{b,0}\/c_{b,1} \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, contradiction (since $p_n$ is prime). Hence $c_{b,1} = 0$, and then $c_{b,0} = 0$. Thus all coefficients $c_{b,\\epsilon}$ are zero, proving linear independence.\n\n**Spanning:**\nAny element $x \\in \\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{p_1}, \\dots, \\sqrt{p_n}]$ can be written as $x = \\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1\\sqrt{p_n}$ where $\\alpha_0, \\alpha_1 \\in \\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{p_1}, \\dots, \\sqrt{p_{n-1}}]$. This is because $\\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{p_1}, \\dots, \\sqrt{p_n}] = \\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{p_1}, \\dots, \\sqrt{p_{n-1}}][\\sqrt{p_n}]$, and since $\\sqrt{p_n}^2 = p_n \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\subset \\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{p_1}, \\dots, \\sqrt{p_{n-1}}]$, every polynomial in $\\sqrt{p_n}$ reduces to a linear expression.\n\nBy the inductive hypothesis, $\\alpha_0$ and $\\alpha_1$ can be expressed as $\\mathbb{Q}$-linear combinations of $B_{n-1}$:\n$$\\alpha_0 = \\sum_{b \\in B_{n-1}} a_{b,0} b, \\quad \\alpha_1 = \\sum_{b \\in B_{n-1}} a_{b,1} b, \\quad a_{b,0}, a_{b,1} \\in \\mathbb{Q}.$$\nThen\n$$x = \\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1\\sqrt{p_n} = \\sum_{b \\in B_{n-1}} a_{b,0} b + \\sum_{b \\in B_{n-1}} a_{b,1} b\\sqrt{p_n} = \\sum_{b \\in B_{n-1}} \\left(a_{b,0} \\cdot b \\cdot \\sqrt{p_n}^0 + a_{b,1} \\cdot b \\cdot \\sqrt{p_n}^1\\right),$$\nwhich is a $\\mathbb{Q}$-linear combination of elements of $B_n$. Hence $B_n$ spans $\\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{p_1}, \\dots, \\sqrt{p_n}]$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSince $B_n$ is linearly independent over $\\mathbb{Q}$ and spans $\\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{p_1}, \\dots, \\sqrt{p_n}]$, it is a $\\mathbb{Q}$-basis. By induction, this holds for all $n \\geq 1$.\n\n**Additional Note:** The dimension of $\\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{p_1}, \\dots, \\sqrt{p_n}]$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $2^n$, matching the size of $B_n$, which is consistent with $B_n$ being a basis.",
