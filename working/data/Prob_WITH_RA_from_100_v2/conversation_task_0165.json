The strict monotonicity of the square root function can be justified by noting that for $0 \\leq x < y$, we have $\\sqrt{y} - \\sqrt{x} = \\frac{y - x}{\\sqrt{y} + \\sqrt{x}} > 0$.\n\n3. Since $\\sqrt{1} = 1$, we conclude:\n   $\\sqrt{2} > 1$.\n\n**Step 5: Relating to the moduli**\n\nFrom Steps 1 and 2, we have $|1 - i| = \\sqrt{2}$ and $|1| = 1$. From Step 4, we have $\\sqrt{2} > 1$. Therefore:\n\n$|1 - i| > |1|$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWe have shown that:\n1. $|1 - i| = \\sqrt{2}$ (by definition of modulus applied to $1 - i$)\n2. $|1| = 1$ (by definition of modulus applied to $1$)\n3. $\\sqrt{2} > 1$ (since $2 > 1$ and the square root function is strictly increasing on non-negative reals)\n\nTherefore, $\\sqrt{2} > 1$, which completes the proof.\n\n**Alternative justification for $\\sqrt{2} > 1$:**\nWe can also prove $\\sqrt{2} > 1$ directly without appealing to monotonicity of square root:\n- Assume for contradiction that $\\sqrt{2} \\leq 1$.\n- Squaring both sides (valid since both sides are non-negative): $2 \\leq 1$.\n- This contradicts the fact that $2 > 1$.\n- Therefore, $\\sqrt{2} > 1$.\n\nBoth approaches are valid and lead to the same conclusion.",
