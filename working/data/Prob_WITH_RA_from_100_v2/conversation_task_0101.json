We have two cases:\\n\\n*Case 1*: If $z_n = a$ for infinitely many $n$, then for those indices $n$, $f(z_n) = f(a) = 1$. However, since $z_n \\\\to a$, if $a$ is not an isolated point of $E$, there must exist infinitely many $n$ such that $z_n \\\\neq a$ (otherwise $z_n$ would be eventually constant at $a$, which only happens if $a$ is isolated). For those $n$ with $z_n \\\\neq a$, we have $f(z_n) = 0$. Thus the sequence $f(z_n)$ oscillates between 0 and 1 and does not converge to $f(a) = 1$.\\n\\n*Case 2*: If $z_n \\\\neq a$ for all sufficiently large $n$ (which is the typical case when $a$ is not isolated), then $f(z_n) = 0$ for all large $n$, so $f(z_n) \\\\to 0 \\\\neq 1 = f(a)$.\\n\\nIn both cases, unless $a$ is an isolated point of $E$ (meaning there exists $\\\\delta > 0$ such that $B_\\\\delta(a) \\\\cap E = \\\\{a\\\\}$), we have $f(z_n) \\\\not\\\\to f(a)$. Therefore, $f$ is not sequentially continuous at $a$ unless $a$ is isolated.\\n\\n**Step 4: Analysis of $\\\\varepsilon$-$\\\\delta$ Continuity at $a$**\\nTake $\\\\varepsilon = \\\\frac{1}{2}$. We need to show that for every $\\\\delta > 0$, there exists $x \\\\in E$ with $|x-a| < \\\\delta$ such that $|f(x)-f(a)| \\\\geq \\\\varepsilon$.\\n\\nIf $a$ is not an isolated point of $E$, then for any $\\\\delta > 0$, there exists $x \\\\in E$ with $0 < |x-a| < \\\\delta$ (since $a$ is a limit point of $E$). For such $x$, we have $x \\\\neq a$, so $f(x) = 0$, while $f(a) = 1$. Therefore:\\n$$|f(x)-f(a)| = |0-1| = 1 > \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\varepsilon$$\\n\\nThus, for $\\\\varepsilon = \\\\frac{1}{2}$, no $\\\\delta > 0$ can satisfy the $\\\\varepsilon$-$\\\\delta$ condition. Hence $f$ is not $\\\\varepsilon$-$\\\\delta$ continuous at $a$ unless $a$ is isolated.\\n\\n**Step 5: Special Case When $a$ is Isolated**\\nIf $a$ is an isolated point of $E$, then there exists $\\\\delta_0 > 0$ such that $B_{\\\\delta_0}(a) \\\\cap E = \\\\{a\\\\}$. In this case:\\n- For sequential continuity: Any sequence $(z_n)$ in $E$ with $z_n \\\\to a$ must eventually satisfy $z_n = a$ for all $n \\\\geq N$ (since $a$ is isolated). Then $f(z_n) = 1$ for all $n \\\\geq N$, so $f(z_n) \\\\to 1 = f(a)$.\\n- For $\\\\varepsilon$-$\\\\delta$ continuity: For any $\\\\varepsilon > 0$, take $\\\\delta = \\\\delta_0$. Then for all $x \\\\in E$ with $|x-a| < \\\\delta$, we have $x = a$, so $|f(x)-f(a)| = |1-1| = 0 < \\\\varepsilon$.\\n\\nThus, when $a$ is isolated, $f$ is continuous at $a$ under both definitions.\\n\\n**Step 6: Conclusion**\\nWe have shown that:\\n1. If $a$ is not an isolated point of $E$, then $f$ is discontinuous at $a$ under both the sequential and $\\\\varepsilon$-$\\\\delta$ definitions of continuity.\\n2. If $a$ is an isolated point of $E$, then $f$ is continuous at $a$ under both definitions.\\n\\nTherefore, the function $f(x) = \\\\begin{cases} 1 & \\\\text{if } x = a \\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\text{if } x \\\\neq a \\\\end{cases}$ is discontinuous at $a$ unless $a$ is an isolated point of $E$.\"\n}\n###END_OF_FORMAT###"

If z_n = a for infinitely many n, then f(z_n) = 1 for those n.
