Let $m$ be a positive integer.\\n\\n**Step 1: Assume the premise is true.**\\nWe are given that the premise $[p_1\\\\to p_2]\\\\land[p_2\\\\to p_3]\\\\land\\\\cdots\\\\land[p_m\\\\to p_{m+1}]$ is true. This means each implication $p_i\\\\to p_{i+1}$ for $i=1,2,\\\\ldots,m$ is true.\\n\\n**Step 2: Assume for contradiction that the conclusion is false.**\\nWe assume the premise is true but the conclusion $[(p_1\\\\land p_2\\\\land\\\\cdots\\\\land p_m)\\\\to p_{m+1}]$ is false. For an implication to be false, the antecedent must be true and the consequent must be false. Therefore:\\n- $(p_1\\\\land p_2\\\\land\\\\cdots\\\\land p_m)$ is true\\n- $p_{m+1}$ is false\\n\\n**Step 3: Analyze the truth of the conjunction.**\\nSince $(p_1\\\\land p_2\\\\land\\\\cdots\\\\land p_m)$ is true, by the definition of conjunction, each proposition $p_i$ for $i=1,2,\\\\ldots,m$ must be true.\\n\\n**Step 4: Apply modus ponens to the first implication.**\\nFrom the premise, we have $p_1\\\\to p_2$ is true. From Step 3, we know $p_1$ is true. By modus ponens (if $p\\\\to q$ is true and $p$ is true, then $q$ must be true), we conclude that $p_2$ must be true.\\n\\n**Step 5: Apply modus ponens to the second implication.**\\nFrom the premise, we have $p_2\\\\to p_3$ is true. From Step 4, we know $p_2$ is true. By modus ponens, we conclude that $p_3$ must be true.\\n\\n**Step 6: Continue the chain of modus ponens applications.**\\nWe proceed inductively: For each $i$ from $1$ to $m-1$, we have:\\n- $p_i\\\\to p_{i+1}$ is true (from the premise)\\n- $p_i$ is true (from the previous step or from Step 3 for $i=1$)\\n- Therefore, by modus ponens, $p_{i+1}$ is true\\n\\nBy this process, we establish that $p_2, p_3, \\\\ldots, p_m$ are all true. In particular, $p_m$ is true.\\n\\n**Step 7: Apply modus ponens to the last implication.**\\nFrom the premise, we have $p_m\\\\to p_{m+1}$ is true. From Step 6, we know $p_m$ is true. By modus ponens, we conclude that $p_{m+1}$ must be true.\\n\\n**Step 8: Reach a contradiction.**\\nFrom Step 7, we have deduced that $p_{m+1}$ is true. However, from Step 2, we assumed that $p_{m+1}$ is false. This is a contradiction: $p_{m+1}$ cannot be both true and false.\\n\\n**Step 9: Conclude the proof.**\\nSince assuming the premise is true and the conclusion is false leads to a contradiction, our assumption in Step 2 must be incorrect. Therefore, whenever the premise $[p_1\\\\to p_2]\\\\land[p_2\\\\to p_3]\\\\land\\\\cdots\\\\land[p_m\\\\to p_{m+1}]$ is true, the conclusion $[(p_1\\\\land p_2\\\\land\\\\cdots\\\\land p_m)\\\\to p_{m+1}]$ must also be true.\\n\\nThus, we have proven that $[p_1\\\\to p_2]\\\\land[p_2\\\\to p_3]\\\\land\\\\cdots\\\\land[p_m\\\\to p_{m+1}]\\\\Rightarrow[(p_1\\\\land p_2\\\\land\\\\cdots\\\\land p_m)\\\\to p_{m+1}]$.\\n\\n**Alternative perspective:** This proof demonstrates the transitivity property of implication through a chain. If $p_1$ implies $p_2$, $p_2$ implies $p_3$, ..., and $p_m$ implies $p_{m+1}$, then if all of $p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_m$ are true, it follows that $p_{m+1}$ must be true.\"\n}\n###END_OF_FORMAT###"

We are given the premise: [p₁→p₂]∧[p₂→p₃]∧⋯∧[pₘ→pₘ₊₁].\nStep 2) We need to prove the conclusion: [(p₁∧p₂∧⋯∧pₘ)→pₘ₊₁].\nStep 3) Assume for contradiction that the premise is true but the conclusion is false. This means (p₁∧p₂∧⋯∧pₘ) is true but pₘ₊₁ is false.\nStep 4) Since (p₁∧p₂∧⋯∧pₘ) is true, each pᵢ for i=1,...,m is true.\nStep 5) From the premise, we have p₁→p₂ is true. Since p₁ is true (from Step 4), by modus ponens, p₂ must be true.\nStep 6) Similarly, we have p₂→p₃ is true. Since p₂ is true (from Step 5), by modus ponens, p₃ must be true.\nStep 7) Continue this process: For each i from 1 to m-1, use pᵢ→pᵢ₊₁ and the truth of pᵢ to deduce pᵢ₊₁ is true.\nStep 8) By the time we reach i=m, we have pₘ is true (from the chain) and pₘ→pₘ₊₁ is true (from the premise).\nStep 9) Applying modus ponens to pₘ→pₘ₊₁ with pₘ true gives pₘ₊₁ must be true.\nStep 10) But this contradicts Step 3 where we assumed pₘ₊₁ is false. Therefore, our assumption was wrong, and the conclusion must follow from the premise.\nStep 11) Alternatively, we can prove this by mathematical induction on m, with the base case m=1 being trivial and the inductive step using the chain property.",
