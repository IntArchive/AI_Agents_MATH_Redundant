        "mathematician and proof writer": "Assumption:\nAssumption 1: [\nProblem:\nProve that \"$|f_n-f|\\\\leq g_n+g$\",\n{\n  \"new_problem\": \"Prove that $|f_n-f|\\\\leq g_n+g$ under the assumptions that $|f_n|\\\\leq g_n$ and $|f|\\\\leq g$ (pointwise or almost everywhere).\",\n  \"detailed_proof\": \"We aim to prove the inequality $|f_n(x) - f(x)| \\\\leq g_n(x) + g(x)$ for all $x$ in the domain (or for almost every $x$ in a measure-theoretic context). The proof proceeds as follows:\\n\\n1. **Triangle Inequality**: For any real or complex numbers $a$ and $b$, the triangle inequality states that $|a - b| \\\\leq |a| + |b|$. Applying this to the functions $f_n$ and $f$ at each point $x$ in their domain, we obtain:\\n   $$|f_n(x) - f(x)| \\\\leq |f_n(x)| + |f(x)|.$$\\n   This inequality holds pointwise for every $x$ where $f_n$ and $f$ are defined.\\n\\n2. **Given Bounds**: By assumption, we have the pointwise bounds:\\n   $$|f_n(x)| \\\\leq g_n(x) \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad |f(x)| \\\\leq g(x)$$\\n   for all $x$ in the domain (or for almost every $x$). These bounds may be provided as hypotheses or derived from other properties of the functions.\\n\\n3. **Combining the Bounds**: Adding the two inequalities from step 2 yields:\\n   $$|f_n(x)| + |f(x)| \\\\leq g_n(x) + g(x).$$\\n   This follows from the fact that if $a \\\\leq b$ and $c \\\\leq d$, then $a + c \\\\leq b + d$.\\n\\n4. **Transitivity of Inequalities**: From steps 1 and 3, we have:\\n   $$|f_n(x) - f(x)| \\\\leq |f_n(x)| + |f(x)| \\\\leq g_n(x) + g(x).$$\\n   By the transitivity of the inequality relation (if $A \\\\leq B$ and $B \\\\leq C$, then $A \\\\leq C$), we conclude:\\n   $$|f_n(x) - f(x)| \\\\leq g_n(x) + g(x).$$\\n\\n5. **Domain of Validity**: The inequality holds at every point $x$ where both the triangle inequality and the given bounds are valid. If the bounds $|f_n| \\\\leq g_n$ and $|f| \\\\leq g$ hold almost everywhere (with respect to some measure), then the conclusion $|f_n - f| \\\\leq g_n + g$ also holds almost everywhere. This is because the set where the conclusion might fail is contained in the union of the sets where the bounds fail, which has measure zero.\\n\\n6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, under the assumptions that $|f_n| \\\\leq g_n$ and $|f| \\\\leq g$ (pointwise or almost everywhere), we have proven that $|f_n - f| \\\\leq g_n + g$ with the same domain of validity.\\n\\n**Remark**: This result is often used in analysis, particularly in the context of dominated convergence theorems, where $g_n$ and $g$ serve as dominating functions that control the size of $f_n$ and $f$.\"\n}",
