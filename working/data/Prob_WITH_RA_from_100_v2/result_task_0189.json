    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question according to the specified structure. The original question is about proving the limit of (1 + x\/n)^n as n approaches infinity equals e^x. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The example given for the previous problem listed assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. In the example, assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. However, in the current problem, the original question doesn't explicitly state any assumptions beyond what's in the limit expression. \n\nWait, but maybe there's an implicit assumption here. The limit is as n tends to infinity, so n is a positive integer approaching infinity. Also, x is a real number, right? Because typically in this limit, x is any real number. So perhaps the assumptions are that n is an integer and n approaches infinity, and x is a real number. But the problem statement as given in the question doesn't specify these; it's just part of the standard limit.\n\nLooking at the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But in the current problem, the original question doesn't mention any specific conditions on x or n, other than n tending to infinity. So maybe the assumptions here are minimal. Wait, but maybe the user expects me to parse the problem and list any implicit assumptions. For example, in the limit expression, n is a positive integer (since it's in the denominator and raised to the power n), and x is a real constant. But the problem as stated in the title and question doesn't specify these; it's just part of the standard limit. \n\nHmm, the example from the user included an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, even though the original problem statement just said \"for every integer n\". Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem listed assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but that seems contradictory. Wait, looking back, the example's original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like maybe there was a mistake. Wait, no, perhaps the example is incorrect? Or maybe the user made a typo. Wait, let me check again. The example says:\n\nOriginal problem:\nProve that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nassumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nproblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that's inconsistent. The original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Because the original problem is to prove divisibility by 91 (which is 7*13) for every integer n, but the formatted problem restricts n to be divisible by 7. That changes the problem. Maybe the example is incorrect. But perhaps the user intended to show that even if there's an assumption, the problem is structured that way. Wait, but the user is providing an example of how they want the problem structured, so perhaps there's an error in the example. But regardless, I need to follow the instructions given.\n\nIn the current problem, the question is about the limit of (1 + x\/n)^n as n approaches infinity. The standard proof assumes that n is a positive integer approaching infinity, and x is a real number. But the problem as stated doesn't mention any restrictions. However, in mathematical analysis, this limit is typically considered for real numbers x, and n approaching infinity through positive integers. But sometimes, n is allowed to be a real variable approaching infinity. However, the expression (1 + x\/n)^n is commonly presented in calculus courses where n is an integer, but the limit is the same if n is real.\n\nSo, the assumptions here might be:\n\n1. n is a positive integer.\n2. n approaches infinity.\n3. x is a real number.\n\nBut the problem statement as given doesn't specify these. However, in the example, the user included assumptions that were not explicitly stated in the original problem but perhaps were inferred. For instance, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like a mistake because the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7, which would change the problem. So maybe there's confusion in the example. Perhaps the user intended to have the assumptions as per the problem's given conditions.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question is about the limit as n tends to infinity of (1 + x\/n)^n. The standard assumptions here are that x is a real number and n is a positive integer approaching infinity. However, since the problem doesn't state any restrictions, maybe the only assumption is that n approaches infinity. But according to the example, perhaps we need to list all possible assumptions.\n\nWait, the example's original problem was to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91, but the formatted problem's assumptions included n being an integer and divisible by 7. That seems incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which would mean that the divisibility by 7 isn't an assumption but part of the problem's conclusion. So perhaps the example is flawed. Maybe the user made a mistake in the example. But regardless, I need to follow the instructions given, which are to list the assumptions from the problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the problem is to prove the limit as n approaches infinity of (1 + x\/n)^n equals e^x. The standard assumptions would be that x is a real number and n is a positive integer (since the variable is n, typically used for integers). However, in real analysis, n can also be a real variable approaching infinity, and the limit still holds. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n- n approaches infinity.\n- x is a real number.\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't specify these; they are part of the standard context. However, according to the example, perhaps we need to list the assumptions even if they are implicit. For instance, in the example, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", which would make the assumption \"n is an integer\". The additional assumption in the example of \"n is divisible by 7\" seems like an error unless the original problem had that condition, but in the example provided, the original problem doesn't mention divisibility by 7. So perhaps there's a mistake in the example.\n\nIn any case, to format the current problem correctly, we need to list all assumptions. The problem is about the limit as n tends to infinity of (1 + x\/n)^n = e^x. The key assumptions here are:\n\n- n is an integer (since the limit is as n approaches infinity, and typically n is an integer in such contexts unless specified otherwise).\n- n approaches infinity (i.e., n becomes arbitrarily large).\n- x is a real number (since the exponential function e^x is defined for real x).\n\nHowever, the problem statement doesn't explicitly state these; they are part of the standard problem setup. But according to the example, even if the original problem states \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. Similarly, here, even though the problem doesn't state it, perhaps we need to include that n is an integer and approaches infinity, and x is a real number.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the formatted assumption is \"n is an integer\". Then, in the current problem, since the limit is as n approaches infinity, and traditionally n is an integer in such limits unless stated otherwise, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n1. n is a positive integer.\n2. n approaches infinity.\n3. x is a real number.\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't say \"for every integer n\", so maybe we shouldn't include that. However, in mathematical notation, when the limit variable is n, it's often assumed to be an integer unless specified otherwise. But this can vary. To be safe, perhaps we should list the assumptions as:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n- x is a real number.\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't mention x being real. However, the expression e^x is typically for real x. If x were complex, the limit would still hold, but the problem might be in the context of real analysis. Since the user hasn't specified, perhaps we should assume x is real.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nn approaches infinity,\nx is a real number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left(1+\\frac{x}{n}\\right)^n = e^x.$$\n\nBut wait, the example had each assumption on a separate line, addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So each line is a separate assumption. In this case, \"n is a positive integer\" and \"n approaches infinity\" are two separate conditions on n. However, \"n approaches infinity\" is part of the limit, so perhaps it's not an assumption but part of the problem's statement. Wait, but in the example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\". That suggests that in the example, the original problem had a conclusion that required n to be divisible by 7, but the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which contradicts that. So maybe the example is incorrect, but the user's intention is to list all conditions that are given or necessary.\n\nIn the current problem, the limit is as n approaches infinity, which is part of the problem statement. The user's example included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". Therefore, perhaps the user's example is wrong, but the instruction is to list assumptions from the problem. But in the current problem, the only things given are the limit expression, so perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- n approaches infinity.\n\nBut that's part of the limit notation. However, in the example, the original problem's assumption was included even though it was part of the \"for every integer n\". So maybe the user wants to list all conditions that are part of the problem's premise. Therefore, in the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is a positive integer (since the limit is as n approaches infinity, and n is typically an integer in such contexts),\n- x is a real number (since otherwise e^x would need to be defined for complex x, but the problem doesn't specify).\n\nBut the problem as stated doesn't mention these; they are implicit. However, following the example's approach, where \"n is an integer\" is listed as an assumption even though it's part of the original problem's \"for every integer n\", perhaps here we should list \"n is an integer\" and \"x is a real number\" as assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to prove the limit, and the limit is written as n approaches infinity, maybe the only assumption is that n approaches infinity. But that's part of the limit notation, not an assumption. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking back at the user's example, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. But the original problem's statement is about all integers n, so the assumption should be \"n is an integer\", but the second assumption in the example was \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original problem. That seems like an error. Perhaps the user's example is incorrect, but I should proceed based on the instructions.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question is to prove that the limit of (1 + x\/n)^n as n approaches infinity is e^x. The standard assumptions here are that x is a real number and n is a positive integer approaching infinity. Therefore, the assumptions to list are:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n- n approaches infinity.\n- x is a real number.\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't explicitly state these, but they are part of the standard context. However, according to the user's example, even if the problem states \"for every integer n\", the formatted assumption lists \"n is an integer\". Therefore, in this case, we should list:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nn approaches infinity,\nx is a real number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left(1+\\frac{x}{n}\\right)^n = e^x.$$\n\nBut I need to check if these assumptions are all necessary. For example, if n were a real variable approaching infinity, the limit would still hold. Therefore, maybe the assumption that n is an integer is unnecessary. However, in the context of the problem as posed on Math Stack Exchange, the variable n typically denotes an integer unless otherwise specified. Therefore, including \"n is a positive integer\" as an assumption makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the only assumption is that n approaches infinity, as part of the limit, and the rest are part of the problem's variables. But according to the user's example, they listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n\". This suggests that the user wants to extract any conditions imposed on the variables, even if they are given in the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, in this case, the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is a positive integer (since the problem uses n, typically an integer),\n- n approaches infinity (as per the limit),\n- x is a real number (since e^x is the exponential function for real x).\n\nThus, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nn approaches infinity,\nx is a real number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left(1+\\frac{x}{n}\\right)^n = e^x.$$\n\nBut wait, the example included \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which wasn't in the original problem's statement. That suggests that perhaps in the example, the user made a mistake. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to list only the assumptions explicitly given in the problem. However, the current problem's original question doesn't state any assumptions beyond the limit expression. Therefore, perhaps there are no additional assumptions beyond what's in the problem statement. But according to the user's example, they extracted assumptions from the problem's original statement.\n\nWait, the original problem in the example was to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions were \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But this seems contradictory because the original problem's statement was for every integer n, but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which restricts n. This suggests that perhaps the example is incorrect, and the user intended to list the problem's conditions as assumptions. But in that case, the example is flawed.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the safest approach is to list the assumptions that are part of the problem's statement. In the current problem, the problem statement is: \"Prove that the limit as n approaches infinity of (1 + x\/n)^n equals e^x.\" The assumptions here are implicit:\n\n1. n is a positive integer (since the limit is as n tends to infinity, and n is typically an integer in such contexts unless stated otherwise).\n2. x is a real number (since the exponential function is defined for real numbers in basic calculus).\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list these as assumptions.",
