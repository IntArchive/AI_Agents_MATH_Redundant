Since B was arbitrary in C, we conclude C ⊆ D.\\n\\n**Step 3: Show that D is a sigma-algebra**\\nWe need to verify the three properties of a sigma-algebra:\\n\\n1. **Y ∈ D**: Since f⁻¹(Y) = X, and X must be in σ(f⁻¹(C)) because every sigma-algebra contains the whole space, we have f⁻¹(Y) = X ∈ σ(f⁻¹(C)).

Now observe that ∪_{n=1}^∞ f⁻¹(A_n) = f⁻¹(∪_{n=1}^∞ A_n) because for any x ∈ X, x ∈ f⁻¹(∪_{n=1}^∞ A_n) ⇔ f(x) ∈ ∪_{n=1}^∞ A_n ⇔ ∃n such that f(x) ∈ A_n ⇔ ∃n such that x ∈ f⁻¹(A_n) ⇔ x ∈ ∪_{n=1}^∞ f⁻¹(A_n).

        "mathematician and proof writer": "Assumption:\nAssumption 1: C is a collection of subsets of Y\nAssumption 2: f is a function from X to Y\nProblem:\nProve that f⁻¹(σ(C)) ⊆ σ(f⁻¹(C))\nWe will prove that f⁻¹(σ(C)) ⊆ σ(f⁻¹(C)) using the 'good sets principle'. Let's proceed step by step:\n\n**Step 1: Define the collection D**\nDefine D = {A ⊆ Y : f⁻¹(A) ∈ σ(f⁻¹(C))}.\nThis is the collection of all subsets A of Y whose preimage under f belongs to the sigma-algebra generated by f⁻¹(C).\n\n**Step 2: Show that C ⊆ D**\nTake any B ∈ C. By definition, f⁻¹(B) ∈ f⁻¹(C). Since σ(f⁻¹(C)) is the smallest sigma-algebra containing f⁻¹(C), we have f⁻¹(C) ⊆ σ(f⁻¹(C)). Therefore, f⁻¹(B) ∈ σ(f⁻¹(C)). By the definition of D, this means B ∈ D. Since B was arbitrary in C, we conclude C ⊆ D.\n\n**Step 3: Show that D is a sigma-algebra**\nWe need to verify the three properties of a sigma-algebra:\n\n1. **Y ∈ D**: Since f⁻¹(Y) = X, and X must be in σ(f⁻¹(C)) because every sigma-algebra contains the whole space, we have f⁻¹(Y) = X ∈ σ(f⁻¹(C)). Thus Y ∈ D.\n\n2. **Closed under complement**: Suppose A ∈ D. Then f⁻¹(A) ∈ σ(f⁻¹(C)). Since σ(f⁻¹(C)) is a sigma-algebra, it is closed under complement. Therefore, (f⁻¹(A))^c ∈ σ(f⁻¹(C)). But note that (f⁻¹(A))^c = f⁻¹(A^c) because for any x ∈ X, x ∈ f⁻¹(A^c) ⇔ f(x) ∈ A^c ⇔ f(x) ∉ A ⇔ x ∉ f⁻¹(A) ⇔ x ∈ (f⁻¹(A))^c. Thus f⁻¹(A^c) ∈ σ(f⁻¹(C)), which means A^c ∈ D.\n\n3. **Closed under countable unions**: Let {A_n}_{n=1}^∞ be a countable collection of sets in D. For each n, f⁻¹(A_n) ∈ σ(f⁻¹(C)) by definition of D. Since σ(f⁻¹(C)) is a sigma-algebra, it is closed under countable unions, so ∪_{n=1}^∞ f⁻¹(A_n) ∈ σ(f⁻¹(C)). Now observe that ∪_{n=1}^∞ f⁻¹(A_n) = f⁻¹(∪_{n=1}^∞ A_n) because for any x ∈ X, x ∈ f⁻¹(∪_{n=1}^∞ A_n) ⇔ f(x) ∈ ∪_{n=1}^∞ A_n ⇔ ∃n such that f(x) ∈ A_n ⇔ ∃n such that x ∈ f⁻¹(A_n) ⇔ x ∈ ∪_{n=1}^∞ f⁻¹(A_n). Therefore, f⁻¹(∪_{n=1}^∞ A_n) ∈ σ(f⁻¹(C)), which means ∪_{n=1}^∞ A_n ∈ D.\n\nSince D satisfies all three properties, D is a sigma-algebra.\n\n**Step 4: Relate D to σ(C)**\nWe have shown that D is a sigma-algebra and that C ⊆ D. By definition, σ(C) is the smallest sigma-algebra containing C. Since D is a sigma-algebra containing C, we must have σ(C) ⊆ D. This is because σ(C) is the intersection of all sigma-algebras containing C, and D is one such sigma-algebra.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the desired inclusion**\nTake any A ∈ σ(C). From Step 4, we know A ∈ D. By definition of D, this means f⁻¹(A) ∈ σ(f⁻¹(C)). Since A was an arbitrary element of σ(C), we have shown that for every A ∈ σ(C), f⁻¹(A) ∈ σ(f⁻¹(C)).\n\n**Step 6: Final conclusion**\nTherefore, f⁻¹(σ(C)) = {f⁻¹(A) : A ∈ σ(C)} ⊆ σ(f⁻¹(C)). This completes the proof.\n\n**Key observations**:\n1. The proof uses the 'good sets principle' by defining D as the collection of sets whose preimages are in σ(f⁻¹(C)).\n2. The crucial properties used are: f⁻¹(A^c) = (f⁻¹(A))^c and f⁻¹(∪A_n) = ∪f⁻¹(A_n) for any collection of sets.\n3. The argument relies on the fact that σ(f⁻¹(C)) is a sigma-algebra and σ(C) is the smallest sigma-algebra containing C.",
