        "mathematician and proof writer": "Assumption:\nAssumption 1: $f$ is continuous on the interval $[0, \\infty)$\nAssumption 2: The limit $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x)$ exists and is a real number\nProblem:\nProve that $|f(x)-f(y)| = |f(x)-L + L-f(y)| \\leq |f(x)-L| + |L-f(y)| \\lt k+k = 2k$\nWe are given that $f$ is continuous on $[0, \\infty)$ and $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = L$ exists as a finite real number. We need to prove that for any $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $M > 0$ such that for all $x, y > M$, we have $|f(x) - f(y)| < 2\\varepsilon$.\n\n**Step 1: Apply the definition of limit at infinity.**\nSince $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = L$, by the definition of limit, for any $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $M > 0$ such that for all $x > M$, we have $|f(x) - L| < \\varepsilon$. This $M$ depends on $\\varepsilon$.\n\n**Step 2: Choose $k = \\varepsilon$.**\nLet $k = \\varepsilon$. Then for any $x > M$, we have $|f(x) - L| < k$. Similarly, for any $y > M$, we have $|f(y) - L| < k$.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the triangle inequality.**\nFor any $x, y > M$, consider the expression $|f(x) - f(y)|$. We can rewrite it as:\n\\[ |f(x) - f(y)| = |f(x) - L + L - f(y)|. \\]\nNow apply the triangle inequality $|a + b| \\le |a| + |b|$ with $a = f(x) - L$ and $b = L - f(y)$:\n\\[ |f(x) - L + L - f(y)| \\le |f(x) - L| + |L - f(y)|. \\]\nNote that $|L - f(y)| = |f(y) - L|$.\n\n**Step 4: Substitute the bounds from Step 2.**\nSince $x > M$, we have $|f(x) - L| < k$. Since $y > M$, we have $|f(y) - L| < k$. Therefore,\n\\[ |f(x) - L| + |f(y) - L| < k + k = 2k. \\]\n\n**Step 5: Combine the inequalities.**\nPutting everything together, we obtain:\n\\[ |f(x) - f(y)| \\le |f(x) - L| + |f(y) - L| < 2k = 2\\varepsilon. \\]\n\n**Step 6: Conclusion.**\nThus, for any $\\varepsilon > 0$, we have found $M > 0$ (the same $M$ from the limit definition) such that for all $x, y > M$, we have $|f(x) - f(y)| < 2\\varepsilon$. This shows that $f$ is uniformly continuous on the interval $[M, \\infty)$. More precisely, given $\\varepsilon > 0$, choose $\\delta = \\varepsilon$ (or any positive number) and $M$ as above; then whenever $x, y > M$, regardless of how close they are, we have $|f(x) - f(y)| < 2\\varepsilon$. This is the essence of uniform continuity on $[M, \\infty)$.\n\n**Remark:** The continuity of $f$ on $[0, \\infty)$ ensures that $f$ is uniformly continuous on the compact interval $[0, M+1]$ by the Heine-Cantor theorem. Combining this with the uniform continuity on $[M, \\infty)$ (proved above) yields that $f$ is uniformly continuous on the entire $[0, \\infty)$. However, the problem specifically asks for the inequality $|f(x)-f(y)| < 2\\varepsilon$ for $x, y > M$, which we have established.",
