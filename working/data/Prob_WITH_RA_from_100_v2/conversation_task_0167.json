Write the Taylor expansion: f(z) = a_k z^k + a_{k+1} z^{k+1} + ... with a_k ≠ 0.\nStep 2) Factor out z^k: f(z) = z^k·g(z) where g(z) = a_k + a_{k+1}z + ... is analytic and g(0) = a_k ≠ 0.\nStep 3) Prove that k must be 1. Suppose k>1. Then f'(0)=0. Since f is injective, f'(z)≠0 for all z∈Ω (prove by contradiction: if f'(z₀)=0, then near z₀, f is locally m-to-1 with m≥2, contradicting injectivity).\nStep 4) Therefore k=1, so f(z) = z·h(z) where h(z)=g(z) is analytic and h(0)=a₁≠0.\nStep 5) For the more general form f(z) = (z·h(z))^k, if we interpret this as f being the k-th power of some function, note that any analytic injective function with f(0)=0 must have a simple zero at 0 (k=1), so f(z)=z·h(z). Taking k-th powers would generally not preserve injectivity unless additional conditions are met.",

By the definition of zero order, we can write the Taylor expansion of f about 0 as:\n\nf(z) = a_k z^k + a_{k+1} z^{k+1} + a_{k+2} z^{k+2} + ⋯\n\nwhere a_k ≠ 0 (otherwise the zero would have higher order).\n\n**Step 2: Factorization**\nFactor out z^k from the Taylor expansion:\n\nf(z) = z^k · g(z)\n\nwhere g(z) = a_k + a_{k+1}z + a_{k+2}z^2 + ⋯ is analytic at 0 (in fact, on all of Ω since f is analytic on Ω) and g(0) = a_k ≠ 0.\n\n**Step 3: Showing k = 1**\nWe prove that k must equal 1. Suppose, for contradiction, that k > 1.\n\nFirst, compute the derivative of f at 0:\n\nf'(0) = lim_{z→0} \\frac{f(z) - f(0)}{z} = lim_{z→0} \\frac{z^k g(z)}{z} = lim_{z→0} z^{k-1} g(z) = 0 · g(0) = 0\n\nsince k > 1 implies k-1 ≥ 1.\n\nNow we use a key property of analytic functions: If f is analytic and injective on Ω, then f'(z) ≠ 0 for all z ∈ Ω. We prove this by contradiction:\n\nAssume there exists z₀ ∈ Ω such that f'(z₀) = 0. Since f is analytic, we can write its Taylor expansion about z₀:\n\nf(z) = f(z₀) + a_m (z - z₀)^m + higher order terms\n\nwhere m ≥ 2 (since f'(z₀) = 0 implies the first nonzero term has order m ≥ 2) and a_m ≠ 0. For w sufficiently close to f(z₀), the equation f(z) = w has exactly m solutions (counting multiplicity) near z₀ by the argument principle or local mapping theorem. In particular, for w ≠ f(z₀) sufficiently close to f(z₀), there are m distinct solutions near z₀ (since the m roots of f(z) - w = 0 are distinct for generic w). This contradicts the injectivity of f. Therefore, f'(z) ≠ 0 for all z ∈ Ω.\n\nApplying this to our case: Since we assumed k > 1, we have f'(0) = 0, which contradicts the fact that f'(z) ≠ 0 for all z ∈ Ω (in particular at z = 0). Therefore, our assumption k > 1 must be false, and we conclude that k = 1.\n\n**Step 4: Final form**\nSince k = 1, we have:\n\nf(z) = z^1 · g(z) = z · g(z)\n\nDefine h(z) = g(z). Then h is analytic on Ω (since g is analytic) and h(0) = g(0) = a₁ ≠ 0 (where a₁ is the first nonzero coefficient in the Taylor expansion, which we now know is the coefficient of z^1).\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nWe have shown that f(z) = z · h(z), where h is analytic on Ω and h(0) ≠ 0. This means f has a simple zero at 0, completing the proof.\n\n**Remark:** The original problem statement mentioned f(z) = (z·h(z))^k. As shown above, for an analytic injective function with f(0)=0, we must have k=1, so the correct form is f(z) = z·h(z). If k > 1, then (z·h(z))^k would have a zero of order k at 0, and its derivative at 0 would be 0, contradicting injectivity as shown in Step 3.",
