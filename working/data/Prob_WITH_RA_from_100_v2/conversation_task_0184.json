This violates the definition of uniform continuity, which requires that for any given $\\epsilon > 0$, we can find $\\delta > 0$ such that whenever points are within $\\delta$, their function values are within $\\epsilon$. By taking $\\epsilon = 1/2$, we see that no matter how small $\\delta$ is, we can always find $x_n$ and $y_n$ with $|x_n - y_n| < \\delta$ but $|f(x_n) - f(y_n)| = 1 > 1/2$.\n\nThus, $f(x) = \\sin(x^2)$ is not uniformly continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$.",
