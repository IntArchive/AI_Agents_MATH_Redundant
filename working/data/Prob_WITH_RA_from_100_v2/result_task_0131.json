    "Content":"The equality$$\\left(1-\\frac13+\\frac15-\\frac17+\\cdots\\right)^2=\\frac38\\left(\\frac1{1^2}+\\frac1{2^2}+\\frac1{3^2}+\\frac1{4^2}+\\cdots\\right)\\tag{1}$$follows from the fact that the sum of the first series is $\\dfrac\\pi4$, whereas the sum of the second one is $\\dfrac{\\pi^2}6$. My question is: can someone provide a proof that $(1)$ holds without using this?",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"Here is a proof of the identity $$\\left(\\sum_{n \\geq 0} \\frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1)}\\right)^2 = \\frac{3}{8} \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\frac{1}{n^2}$$ without knowing the value of either series. Consider the double integral \\begin{align*}\nI &= \\int_{0}^{1} \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{1}{(1+x^2)(1+y^2)} \\ dy \\ dx.\n\\end{align*} On one hand, we observe \\begin{align*}\n \\frac{1}{(1+x^2)(1+y^2)} &= \\sum_{n \\geq 0} \\left(-x^2 \\right)^n \\sum_{m \\geq 0} \\left(-y^2 \\right)^m, \\quad |x|,|y| < 1.\n\\end{align*} Then, we get that \\begin{align*}\nI &= \\int_{0}^1 \\int_{0}^1 \\sum_{n \\geq 0} \\left(-x^2 \\right)^n \\sum_{m \\geq 0} \\left(-y^2 \\right)^m \\ dy \\ dx \\\\\n&=\\sum_{n \\geq 0}\\sum_{m \\geq 0}  \\int_{0}^1 \\int_{0}^1 \\left(-x^2 \\right)^n \\left(-y^2 \\right)^m \\ dy \\ dx \\\\\n&=\\sum_{n \\geq 0}\\sum_{m \\geq 0} \\frac{(-1)^n}{2n+1} \\frac{(-1)^m}{2m+1} \\\\\n&=\\left(\\sum_{n \\geq 0}  \\frac{(-1)^n}{2n+1} \\right)^2.\n\\end{align*} The interchanging of sum and integral done here can be justified by the Dominated Convergence Theorem. Now, we make the substitution $x \\mapsto 1\/x,$ and $y \\mapsto 1\/y$ to $I,$ resulting in \\begin{align*}\nI &= \\int_{1}^{\\infty}\\int_{1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(1+x^2)(1+y^2)} \\ dy \\ dx,\n\\end{align*} This implies \\begin{align*}\nI &= \\frac{1}{4}\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(1+x^2)(1+y^2)} \\ dy \\ dx.\n\\end{align*} Make another substitution $y=tx$ with $dy = x \\ dt$ to see \\begin{align*}\nI &= \\frac{1}{4}\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x}{(1+x^2)(1+t^2x^2)} \\ dt \\ dx \\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{4}\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x}{(1+x^2)(1+t^2x^2)} \\ dx \\ dt, \n\\end{align*} in which the interchanging of the integral is justified by Tonelli's Theorem.\nNow, using the partial fractions identity, $$\\frac{x}{(1+x^2)(1+t^2x^2)} = \\frac{2 x}{\\left(2-2 t^2\\right) \\left(x^2+1\\right)}-\\frac{2 t^2 x}{\\left(2-2 t^2\\right)\n   \\left(t^2 x^2+1\\right)},$$ and integrating with respect to $x,$ we get \\begin{align*}\nI &= \\frac{1}{4}\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\log(t)}{t^2-1} \\ dt. \n\\end{align*} Now, observe \\begin{align*}\n\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{\\log(t)}{t^2-1} \\ dt + \\int_{1}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\log(t)}{t^2-1} \\ dt= \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\log(t)}{t^2-1} \\ dt.\n\\end{align*} We see that \\begin{align*}\n\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{\\log(t)}{t^2-1} \\ dt &= \\int_{1}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\log(t)}{t^2-1} \\ dt\n\\end{align*} by making a change of variables $t \\mapsto 1\/t$ on the second integral. Thus, \\begin{align*}\nI &= \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{\\log(t)}{t^2-1} \\ dt.\n\\end{align*} Now, convert the integrand into a geometric series \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\log(t)}{t^2-1} &= - \\sum_{n \\geq 0} \\log(t) t^{2n}, \\quad t \\in (0,1),\n\\end{align*} and we see that \\begin{align*}\nI &= -\\frac{1}{2}  \\int_{0}^{1}  \\sum_{n \\geq 0} \\log(t) t^{2n} \\ dt \\\\\n&= -\\frac{1}{2}  \\sum_{n \\geq 0} \\int_{0}^{1} \\log(t) t^{2n} \\ dt \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{n \\geq 0} \\frac{1}{(2n+1)^2},\n\\end{align*} in which the interchanging of sum and integral is justified by Beppo Levi's Monotone Convergence Theorem. \nObserving that \\begin{align*}\n\\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\frac{1}{n^2} &= \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\frac{1}{(2n)^2}+\\sum_{n \\geq 0} \\frac{1}{(2n+1)^2} \\\\\n&=\n\\frac{1}{4}\\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\frac{1}{n^2}+\\sum_{n \\geq 0} \\frac{1}{(2n+1)^2},\n\\end{align*} we find \\begin{align*}\nI &= \\frac{3}{8} \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\frac{1}{n^2}.\n\\end{align*} Hence, we have $$\\left(\\sum_{n \\geq 0} \\frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1)}\\right)^2 = \\frac{3}{8} \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\frac{1}{n^2}.$$ Remark For those that may be interested, these types of integral calculations to evaluate series may be found in my joint paper with Daniele Ritelli.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example they provided involved breaking down assumptions and restating the problem. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original problem from Math Stack Exchange. The title is about proving that the square of the series (1 - 1\/3 + 1\/5 - 1\/7 + ...) equals (3\/8) times the sum of the reciprocal squares. The user mentions that this equality follows from knowing the sums (pi\/4 and pi^2\/6), but they want a proof without using those known results. \n\nNow, I need to filter out unrelated information. The original problem refers to the two series and their sums being known via pi\/4 and pi^2\/6, but the user wants a proof that doesn't rely on those known values. So the key points here are the two series as given, and the requirement to prove the equality without invoking the known sums involving pi.\n\nFor the assumptions part, each should address one property applied to one object. The problem involves two series: the first is an alternating series of odd reciprocals (1 - 1\/3 + 1\/5 - 1\/7 + ...), and the second is the sum of reciprocal squares (1\/1^2 + 1\/2^2 + ...). The task is to show the square of the first equals (3\/8) times the second. So assumptions would be about the convergence or definition of these series. However, since the problem doesn't specify any particular conditions beyond their definitions, maybe the assumptions are implicit here. Wait, the example given had assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But in this problem, there are no variables with conditions. The series are infinite, so perhaps the assumption is that both series converge. Alternatively, maybe there are no explicit assumptions needed here beyond the series as defined. The user might have to list the definitions of the series as assumptions. Let me think.\n\nThe problem is to prove the equality of two expressions: the square of the first series equals 3\/8 times the second series. The original problem mentions that the equality follows from known sums involving pi, but the user wants a proof without using that. So the assumptions would be the definitions of the two series. Each series is an infinite sum: the first is the alternating sum of reciprocals of odd numbers, and the second is the sum of reciprocals of squares. So the assumptions would list each series explicitly. Since each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object, maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe first series is defined as $1 - \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{5} - \\frac{1}{7} + \\cdots$,\nThe second series is defined as $\\frac{1}{1^2} + \\frac{1}{2^2} + \\frac{1}{3^2} + \\frac{1}{4^2} + \\cdots$.\n\nBut the problem statement also mentions squaring the first series. However, the problem is to prove the equality, so the squaring is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. So the assumptions are just the definitions of the two series. Then the problem is to prove that the square of the first equals 3\/8 times the second. \n\nBut wait, the problem statement in the example included the expression with A(n) and the divisibility. In this case, the problem is to show the equality between the square of the first series and 3\/8 times the second series. The original problem didn't specify any conditions on convergence or other properties beyond the series as written, so perhaps the only assumptions are the definitions of the series. Therefore, the formatted problem should list those two series as assumptions, each on their own line. Then the problem is to prove the equality without using the known values involving pi.",
