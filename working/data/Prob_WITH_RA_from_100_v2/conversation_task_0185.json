In particular, for $t \\in (t_0 - \\epsilon, t_0) \\cap [0,1]$, we have $x(t) > 0$. But then $t_0$ cannot be the supremum of the set $\\{t : x(t) = 0\\}$, because any $t < t_0$ with $x(t) = 0$ would have to be less than $t_0 - \\epsilon$, contradicting the definition of supremum. Therefore, $x(t_0) = 0$.\n\n**Claim 2:** For any $\\delta > 0$, there exists $t$ with $t_0 < t < t_0 + \\delta$ such that $x(t) > 0$.\n*Proof of Claim 2:* Suppose, for contradiction, that there exists some $\\delta > 0$ such that for all $t \\in (t_0, t_0 + \\delta)$, we have $x(t) = 0$. Then the set $\\{t : x(t) = 0\\}$ contains the interval $[0, t_0] \\cup (t_0, t_0 + \\delta) = [0, t_0 + \\delta)$. This means that $t_0 + \\delta/2$ is in the set $\\{t : x(t) = 0\\}$ and $t_0 + \\delta/2 > t_0$, contradicting the definition of $t_0$ as the supremum of this set. Therefore, for any $\\delta > 0$, there must exist some $t \\in (t_0, t_0 + \\delta)$ with $x(t) > 0$.\n\nNow consider what happens as $t \\to t_0^+$. By Claim 2, we can choose a sequence $t_n \\to t_0^+$ with $t_n > t_0$ and $x(t_n) > 0$ for all $n$. Since $x$ is continuous and $x(t_0) = 0$, we have $x(t_n) \\to 0^+$ as $n \\to \\infty$.\n\nFor each such $t_n$, we have $y(t_n) = \\sin(1/x(t_n))$. As $x(t_n) \\to 0^+$, the argument $1/x(t_n) \\to \\infty$, and $\\sin(1/x(t_n))$ oscillates infinitely between $-1$ and $1$. In particular, we can find subsequences $t_{n_k}$ such that $\\sin(1/x(t_{n_k})) = 1$ for all $k$, and another subsequence $t_{m_k}$ such that $\\sin(1/x(t_{m_k})) = -1$ for all $k$.\n\nHowever, if $\\gamma$ is continuous at $t_0$, then we must have $y(t) \\to y(t_0) = 0$ as $t \\to t_0$. But we have found sequences $t_n \\to t_0$ with $y(t_n) = \\sin(1/x(t_n))$ not converging to $0$ (in fact, taking values $1$ and $-1$ along different subsequences). This contradicts the continuity of $\\gamma$ at $t_0$.\n\nTherefore, our initial assumption that $G$ is path-connected must be false. Hence, $G$ is not path-connected.\n\nThis completes the proof that the graph of the topologist's sine curve is not path-connected.",

Since x(0) = 0 and x(1) = 1 > 0, we have 0 ≤ t₀ < 1.\nStep 4) By continuity of x, we have x(t₀) = 0 (since if x(t₀) > 0, then by continuity there would be an interval around t₀ where x(t) > 0, contradicting the definition of t₀ as supremum).\nStep 5) For any δ > 0, there exists t with t₀ < t < t₀ + δ such that x(t) > 0 (otherwise t₀ would not be the supremum).\nStep 6) As t → t₀⁺, we have x(t) → 0⁺.
