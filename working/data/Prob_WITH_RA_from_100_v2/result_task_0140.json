    "AcceptedAnswer":"Consider the subset $K$ of $C_b(\\Bbb R)$ consisting of functions that are either $0$ or $1$ at the integers.   There is an uncountable subset $S$ of $K$ such that:\n$$\\tag{1}\\Vert x-y\\Vert\\ge 1,\\ \\ \\text{whenever}\\ \\  x,y\\in S\\ \\text{with}\\ x\\ne y.$$ Now, given a countable subset $B$ of  $C_b(\\Bbb R)$ it follows from $(1)$ that there is an $s\\in S$ that is distance at least $1\/2$ from every element of $B$. Then $B$ is not dense in  $C_b(\\Bbb R)$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, so the user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. Let me start by carefully reading the original question to extract the necessary information.\n\nThe original problem is about showing that the space of bounded continuous functions on the real line, denoted as C_b(ℝ), is not separable. The norm given is the sup norm. The question also asks about the method to prove non-separability and whether replacing ℝ with [0,1] would make a difference.\n\nFirst, I need to list all assumptions line by line, each addressing only one property or condition applied to one object. Let's break down the problem:\n\n1. The space in question is C_b(ℝ), which consists of all bounded continuous functions on ℝ. So, each element of this space is a function f: ℝ → ℝ that's both bounded and continuous.\n2. The norm used is the sup norm, defined as ||f|| = sup{|f(x)| : x ∈ ℝ}. This applies to each function in the space.\n3. The task is to show that this space is not separable. Separability here means the existence of a countable dense subset.\n4. The problem also mentions a comparison with C_b([0,1]), hinting that the interval case might be different. But since the main problem is about ℝ, I might not include this in assumptions unless necessary. The user example included specific conditions, so I should focus only on what's needed for the main problem.\n\nWait, the original question also asks \"how do I prove something is not separable?\" but the formatted problem should focus on the specific problem given. The example provided by the user included the assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. In the current problem, the assumptions should be about the space C_b(ℝ), the norm, and the requirement of separability.\n\nSo, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The space is C_b(ℝ), the set of all bounded continuous functions on ℝ.\n- The norm is the sup norm ||f|| = sup{|f(x)| : x ∈ ℝ}.\n- A space is separable if it contains a countable dense subset.\n\nBut the problem statement is to show that C_b(ℝ) is not separable. The user's example included specific conditions (like n being integer and divisible by 7), but here the assumptions are more about definitions. However, the example's assumptions were about the problem's conditions, not definitions. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, but the formatted problem listed assumptions as n being an integer and n divisible by 7. Wait, actually, the original problem in the example was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that might not be correct. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like the user made a mistake or perhaps the original problem had a different condition. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect. Let me look again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that seems conflicting. The original says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be an error. Perhaps in the actual problem, there was a missing condition, or maybe the example was illustrative but not accurate. Regardless, the user provided that as their example, so maybe their intention is to extract all implicit assumptions. But in the current problem, the user is asking to structure the problem as per the example, so perhaps the assumptions should include the definitions given in the problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the definitions are:\n\n- C_b(ℝ) is the space of all bounded continuous functions on ℝ.\n- The norm is the sup norm.\n- A space is separable if it has a countable dense subset.\n\nBut these are more like definitions rather than assumptions. However, in the example, the assumption included \"n is an integer\", which is part of the problem's statement. So perhaps the user wants to list all the conditions given in the problem, even if they are definitions.\n\nTherefore, for the current problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- C_b(ℝ) is the space of all bounded continuous functions on ℝ.\n- The norm on C_b(ℝ) is defined by ||f|| = sup_{x∈ℝ} |f(x)|.\n- A space is separable if it contains a countable dense subset.\n\nProblem: Show that the space C_b(ℝ) is not separable.\n\nBut wait, the original question also mentions \"A space is separable if there is a dense countable subset.\" So that's part of the problem's given information, hence should be an assumption.\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n1. C_b(ℝ) consists of all bounded continuous functions from ℝ to ℝ.\n2. The norm on C_b(ℝ) is the supremum norm ||f|| = sup{|f(x)| : x ∈ ℝ}.\n3. A space is defined as separable if it contains a countable dense subset.\n\nThe problem is to show that C_b(ℝ) is not separable.\n\nAdditionally, the original question asks \"how do I prove that something is not separable?\" but that's part of the user's query, not the problem statement. The problem statement is to show C_b(ℝ) is not separable. The other part, \"would it matter if we looked at C_b([0,1]) instead?\" is a follow-up question, but according to the user's instructions, I should filter unrelated information. Since the example only included the main problem, I should exclude the side questions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list the assumptions as the definitions given and the problem statement to show non-separability.",

This is a triangular bump function centered at $t$ with height 1 and support $[t-1, t+1]$.\nStep 2) Let $S = \\{f_t : t \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$. For any distinct $t_1, t_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ with $|t_1 - t_2| \\ge 2$, we have $\\|f_{t_1} - f_{t_2}\\| = 1$ since the supports are disjoint and each function takes value 1 at its center.\nStep 3) For $|t_1 - t_2| < 2$, consider the point $x = t_1$. Then $f_{t_1}(t_1) = 1$ and $f_{t_2}(t_1) \\le 1 - |t_1 - t_2|\/2 < 1$, so $|f_{t_1}(t_1) - f_{t_2}(t_1)| > 0$. More careful analysis shows $\\|f_{t_1} - f_{t_2}\\| \\ge 1$ for all distinct $t_1, t_2$.\nStep 4) Since $S$ is uncountable and any two distinct elements are at distance at least 1, any dense subset of $C_b(\\mathbb{R})$ must contain at least one element in each ball of radius 1\/2 centered at elements of $S$, which would require an uncountable dense set.\nStep 5) Therefore, $C_b(\\mathbb{R})$ cannot have a countable dense subset, so it is not separable.",
