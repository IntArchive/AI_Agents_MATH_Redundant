Let B = {v₁, v₂, ..., vₙ} and B' = {w₁, w₂, ..., wₙ} be two bases for V.\\n\\nStep 1: Let S be the change-of-basis matrix from B to B'. This means that for each basis vector wⱼ in B', we can express it as a linear combination of the basis vectors in B: wⱼ = Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ sᵢⱼvᵢ, where the coefficients sᵢⱼ form the matrix S = [sᵢⱼ]. The matrix S is invertible since it represents a change between two bases.\\n\\nStep 2: Let A be the matrix representation of T with respect to basis B.

This is a standard result in linear algebra: when we change basis using matrix S, the matrix representation of a linear transformation changes by similarity transformation.\\n\\nStep 4: Consider the characteristic polynomial of T with respect to basis B:\\nQ_B(t) = det(A - tIₙ)\\nwhere Iₙ is the n×n identity matrix.\\n\\nStep 5: Consider the characteristic polynomial of T with respect to basis B':\\nQ_{B'}(t) = det(A' - tIₙ) = det(S⁻¹AS - tIₙ)\\n\\nStep 6: We simplify Q_{B'}(t) using properties of determinants and similarity:\\nQ_{B'}(t) = det(S⁻¹AS - tIₙ)\\n           = det(S⁻¹AS - tS⁻¹S)  (since S⁻¹S = Iₙ)\\n           = det(S⁻¹AS - S⁻¹(tIₙ)S)  (since S⁻¹(tIₙ)S = tS⁻¹S = tIₙ)\\n           = det(S⁻¹(A - tIₙ)S)  (factor out S⁻¹ from left and S from right)\\n           = det(S⁻¹) · det(A - tIₙ) · det(S)  (by multiplicativity of determinant)\\n           = det(S⁻¹S) · det(A - tIₙ)  (since det(S⁻¹)det(S) = det(S⁻¹S))\\n           = det(Iₙ) · det(A - tIₙ)\\n           = 1 · det(A - tIₙ)\\n           = det(A - tIₙ)\\n           = Q_B(t)\\n\\nThus we have shown that Q_{B'}(t) = Q_B(t).

This follows from the expansion of the determinant in terms of permutations or from Vieta's formulas applied to the eigenvalues.\\n\\nStep 8: Since Q_B(t) = Q_{B'}(t), these two polynomials are identical.

This is a standard result in linear algebra: when we change basis using matrix S, the matrix representation of a linear transformation changes by similarity transformation.\n\nStep 4: Consider the characteristic polynomial of T with respect to basis B:\nQ_B(t) = det(A - tIₙ)\nwhere Iₙ is the n×n identity matrix.\n\nStep 5: Consider the characteristic polynomial of T with respect to basis B':\nQ_{B'}(t) = det(A' - tIₙ) = det(S⁻¹AS - tIₙ)\n\nStep 6: We simplify Q_{B'}(t) using properties of determinants and similarity:\nQ_{B'}(t) = det(S⁻¹AS - tIₙ)\n           = det(S⁻¹AS - tS⁻¹S)  (since S⁻¹S = Iₙ)\n           = det(S⁻¹AS - S⁻¹(tIₙ)S)  (since S⁻¹(tIₙ)S = tS⁻¹S = tIₙ)\n           = det(S⁻¹(A - tIₙ)S)  (factor out S⁻¹ from left and S from right)\n           = det(S⁻¹) · det(A - tIₙ) · det(S)  (by multiplicativity of determinant)\n           = det(S⁻¹S) · det(A - tIₙ)  (since det(S⁻¹)det(S) = det(S⁻¹S))\n           = det(Iₙ) · det(A - tIₙ)\n           = 1 · det(A - tIₙ)\n           = det(A - tIₙ)\n           = Q_B(t)\n\nThus we have shown that Q_{B'}(t) = Q_B(t). This proves that the characteristic polynomial of T is independent of the choice of basis.\n\nStep 7: The characteristic polynomial of an n×n matrix can be expanded as:\ndet(A - tIₙ) = (-1)ⁿtⁿ + (-1)ⁿ⁻¹tr(A)tⁿ⁻¹ + ... + det(A)\nMore precisely, the coefficient of tⁿ⁻¹ is (-1)ⁿ⁻¹ times the trace of A. This follows from the expansion of the determinant in terms of permutations or from Vieta's formulas applied to the eigenvalues.\n\nStep 8: Since Q_B(t) = Q_{B'}(t), these two polynomials are identical. Therefore, all their coefficients must be equal. In particular, the coefficients of tⁿ⁻¹ must be equal:\n(-1)ⁿ⁻¹tr(A) = (-1)ⁿ⁻¹tr(A')\n\nStep 9: Canceling the common factor (-1)ⁿ⁻¹ (which is nonzero since it's either 1 or -1), we obtain:\ntr(A) = tr(A')\n\nStep 10: Since A and A' are matrix representations of the same linear transformation T with respect to different bases B and B', we have shown that the trace of the matrix representation is the same regardless of which basis we choose. Therefore, the trace of a linear transformation is well-defined and independent of the choice of basis.\n\nThis completes the proof. ∎",

Let B = {v₁, v₂, ..., vₙ} and B' = {w₁, w₂, ..., wₙ} be two bases for V.\n\nStep 1: Let S be the change-of-basis matrix from B to B'. This means that for each basis vector wⱼ in B', we can express it as a linear combination of the basis vectors in B: wⱼ = Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ sᵢⱼvᵢ, where the coefficients sᵢⱼ form the matrix S = [sᵢⱼ]. The matrix S is invertible since it represents a change between two bases.\n\nStep 2: Let A be the matrix representation of T with respect to basis B.
