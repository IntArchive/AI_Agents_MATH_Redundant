    "AcceptedAnswer":"Borel's theorem states that given a sequence of real numbers $(a_n)_{n\\in \\mathbb N}$ there exists a $C^\\infty$ function $f\\in C^\\infty(\\mathbb R)$ such that \n$\\frac {f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}=a_n $ ,  i.e. the Taylor series associated to $f$ is $\\Sigma a_nX^n$. The function $f$ is never unique: you can always add to it a flat function, one all of whose derivatives at zero are zero, like the well-known Cauchy function $e^{-1\/x^2}$  . There is a huge caveat however: you can't go from the series to the function $f$ . Firstly,  the series might not be convergent at any $x\\neq 0\\in \\mathbb R $ ! An example is $\\Sigma a_n X^n=\\Sigma n^n X^n$ whose radius of convergence is zero. Secondly, even if it does converge it might converge to the wrong function! For example if you start with Cauchy's function you get the zero Taylor series. It converges to zero, of course, but that is definitely not the Cauchy function you started with. So we should not read too much in Borel's theorem: it cannot force a non-analytic function to become analytic! Borel's theorem is also valid in several variables. Given a sequence of $k$-tuples $(a_I)_{I\\in \\mathbb N^k}$ of real numbers $a_I \\in\\mathbb R$, there exists a function $f\\in C^\\infty(\\mathbb R^k)$, again highly non-unique,  whose derivatives satisfy\n$\\frac {\\partial^I f(0)}{I!}=a_I  $. [I have used multiindex notation with $I=(i_1,\\ldots,i_k)$,  $I!=i_1!\\ldots i_k!  \\;etc.$] There is a vast generalization due to Whitney of Borel's theorem. You can consider a closed subset $Z\\subset \\mathbb R^k$ and continuous functions $\\phi_I\\in C(Z) \\; $ . Whitney gives necessary and sufficient growth and compatibility conditions on the $\\phi_I $ 's which will guarantee that there exists a $C^\\infty$ function $f\\in C^\\infty (U)$ defined on an open neighbourhood  $U \\supset Z$ of $Z$ such that $\\frac {\\partial^I f(0)}{I!}=\\phi_I \\; $.  Borel' s theorem is then  the case $Z=\\{0\\}$ . Bibliography: Borel's theorem in several variables is proved in R.Narasimhan's book Analysis on Real and complex Manifolds , which also contains the precise statement of Whitney's theorem.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me tackle this problem. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual math professor, specifically to format a given question from Math Stack Exchange into the specified structure with Assumptions and Problem. The example provided shows that assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. Then the problem is restated concisely.\n\nLooking at the example, the original problem had an extra condition in the formatted version, like \"$n$ is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original. Wait, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". Hmm, maybe the example was modified? Wait, no—the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the example was a mistake? Or perhaps the user made an error in the example? Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted version adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which restricts n. That seems conflicting. Maybe the example is incorrect. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instructions and format the given problem according to the example.\n\nNow, the problem given here is from Math Stack Exchange, titled \"Every power series is the Taylor series of some $C^{\\infty}$ function\". The question asks for a reference to a proof of Borel's theorem, which states that every power series is the Taylor series of some $C^\\infty$ function.\n\nSo, I need to structure this into Assumptions and Problem. Let's see. Borel's theorem has certain conditions. The theorem, as I recall, states that for any sequence of real numbers, there exists a smooth (C^∞) function whose Taylor series at a point is the given power series. But the power series might not converge except at the point. The assumptions here would be the conditions required for the theorem to hold. Let me think.\n\nThe key assumptions for Borel's theorem are:\n\n1. Given a sequence of real numbers (the coefficients of the power series).\n2. The function to be constructed is smooth (C^∞).\n3. The Taylor series of the constructed function matches the given power series.\n\nBut in the problem statement as presented in the user's question, the user is asking for a proof reference for the theorem that \"every power series is the Taylor series of some C^∞ function.\" So the problem is to prove that given any power series (regardless of convergence), there exists a C^∞ function whose Taylor series at a point (presumably 0) is that power series.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- Let $\\{a_n\\}$ be a sequence of real numbers. (The coefficients of the power series.)\n- The function $f$ is $C^\\infty$ (infinitely differentiable).\n- The Taylor series of $f$ at 0 is $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n x^n$.\n\nWait, but the problem is to show that such a function exists for any power series. So the assumptions would be the given conditions that need to be met. However, in the example provided by the user, the assumptions were specific to the problem's conditions, like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But in the Borel theorem case, the problem is more general. Let's parse the original problem again.\n\nOriginal problem: \"Do you have some reference to a proof of the so-called Borel theorem, i.e. every power series is the Taylor series of some $C^{\\infty}$ function?\"\n\nSo the problem is to prove that for any power series, there exists a C^∞ function whose Taylor series is that power series. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. Let $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n x^n$ be a power series with real coefficients.\n2. There exists a function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$.\n3. The function $f$ is $C^\\infty$ smooth.\n4. The Taylor series of $f$ at 0 is $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n x^n$.\n\nWait, but the problem is to show that such a function exists. So the assumptions would be the given premises. However, in the example, the assumptions included the variable's conditions. Maybe for Borel's theorem, the key assumptions are that we have a power series (given coefficients) and we need to construct a C^∞ function with that Taylor series. Therefore, the problem is under the assumptions that a power series is given, and the function to be constructed is smooth. But perhaps the problem statement as formatted would have the assumptions being:\n\n- Let $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n x^n$ be a formal power series.\n- There exists a function $f$ such that $f$ is $C^\\infty$.\n- The Taylor series of $f$ at 0 is $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n x^n$.\n\nBut maybe the user's example included specific conditions on the variables in the problem. Alternatively, maybe the assumptions here are minimal. Let's see. The theorem is that for any power series, there's a C^∞ function whose Taylor series is that. So the problem is to prove that given any power series (formal), there exists a C^∞ function with that Taylor series.\n\nIn terms of structuring, the Assumption part should list all the conditions given in the problem. But the original problem doesn't state any specific conditions beyond the general theorem. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- Let $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n x^n$ be a formal power series with real coefficients.\n- The function $f$ is $C^\\infty$ on $\\mathbb{R}$.\n- The Taylor series of $f$ at 0 coincides with the given power series.\n\nBut since the problem is to prove the existence, the assumptions might just be the given power series. Wait, maybe in the problem statement, the assumptions are the premises of the theorem. Since the theorem is \"every power series is the Taylor series of some C^∞ function,\" the assumptions would be:\n\n- Let $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n x^n$ be a formal power series.\n\nThen the problem is to prove there exists a $C^\\infty$ function whose Taylor series is this power series.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions list properties applied to one object each. So in the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem's assumptions would be:\n\n1. There exists a formal power series $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n x^n$.\n2. The function $f$ is $C^\\infty$.\n3. The Taylor series of $f$ at 0 is the given power series.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is simply to prove that given any power series (the assumption being that a power series is given), there exists a C^∞ function with that Taylor series. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n$\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n x^n$ is a formal power series with real coefficients,\n$f$ is a $C^\\infty$ function on $\\mathbb{R}$,\nthe Taylor series of $f$ at 0 is $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n x^n$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that for every formal power series $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n x^n$, there exists a $C^\\infty$ function $f$ such that the Taylor series of $f$ at 0 is $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n x^n$.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumptions included the variable's conditions (n is integer, n divisible by 7). In the original problem here, the theorem is general: for any power series, there exists a function. So the assumption is that a power series is given, and the problem is to construct the function. But the problem statement is to prove the existence. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions should just be the given power series, and the problem is to show the existence of f.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the assumptions include the conditions on the variables in the problem. In their example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem had assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That might be a mistake in the example. But perhaps the user intended to show that even if n is divisible by 7, the problem's conclusion holds. But maybe the example was incorrect. Anyway, I need to follow the instruction given by the user.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's question is to structure the problem as per the example. The example's original problem was phrased as \"Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91\", but the formatted problem lists assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like the original problem was to prove for all integers n, but the formatted problem restricts n to those divisible by 7. Maybe the example is wrong, but I have to proceed.\n\nBut the problem here is the Borel theorem. The problem is to prove that every power series is the Taylor series of some C^∞ function. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- Let $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n x^n$ be a formal power series.\n- There exists a function $f$ that is $C^\\infty$.\n- The Taylor series of $f$ at 0 is $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n x^n$.\n\nBut the problem is to prove existence. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n x^n$ is a formal power series.\n\nAnd the problem is to prove there exists a $C^\\infty$ function $f$ such that the Taylor series of $f$ at 0 is the given power series.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is about the existence for any power series, maybe the assumptions are that we are given an arbitrary power series, and we need to construct f. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n$\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n x^n$ is a formal power series,\n$f$ is a $C^\\infty$ function,\nthe Taylor series of $f$ at 0 is $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n x^n$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that for any formal power series $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n x^n$, there exists a $C^\\infty$ function $f$ such that the Taylor series of $f$ at 0 coincides with $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n x^n$.\n\nBut I need to check the example again. In the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That suggests that maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem had a typo. But regardless, I need to structure the current problem according to the example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example's formatted problem was incorrect. Let me see: The original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem's assumptions include n is an integer (which is correct, as per the original problem's \"for every integer n\"), and also n is divisible by 7. Wait, that's an additional condition not present in the original problem. That seems like an error. Maybe the user intended to format a different problem. But perhaps this is part of the process where the assistant must filter unrelated information and list the assumptions. But in that case, perhaps the original problem had some hidden assumption. But I can't tell. Maybe the example is wrong, but I have to proceed with the current problem.\n\nSo for the Borel theorem problem, the key assumptions would be:\n\n- The power series is arbitrary (given).\n- The function to be constructed is smooth.\n- The Taylor series of the function matches the given power series.\n\nBut the problem is to prove existence. So perhaps the formatted problem should have the assumption that a power series is given, and the problem is to prove existence of a smooth function with that Taylor series.\n\nTherefore, in the Assumption section:\n\nAssumption:\n$\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n x^n$ is a formal power series,\n$f$ is a $C^\\infty$ function,\nthe Taylor series of $f$ at 0 is $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n x^n$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that for every formal power series $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n x^n$, there exists a $C^\\infty$ function $f$ such that the Taylor series of $f$ at 0 is $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n x^n$.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to prove the existence, the assumptions are the given power series. So maybe the Assumption section just lists that a formal power series is given. But the example included two assumptions for the same variable n: being an integer and divisible by 7. So in this case, perhaps the assumption is just the existence of the power series. But the problem statement is \"every power series is the Taylor series...\", so the only assumption is that a power series is given. The problem is to construct f.\n\nBut in the example, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem's assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". That suggests that maybe the user wants to split each condition into separate assumptions. But in the original problem, the conclusion was that A(n) is divisible by 91. If n is divisible by 7, then maybe 91 divides A(n) even under that condition. But the example's original problem didn't state that. So perhaps the example was flawed. Nevertheless, for the current problem, let's proceed.\n\nThe user's question is to structure the problem as per the example. The example's assumptions list each condition line by line, applied to one object. For the Borel theorem, the main assumption is that a power series is given, and the problem is to prove existence of a smooth function with that Taylor series. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n$\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n x^n$ is a formal power series,\n$f$ is a $C^\\infty$ function on $\\mathbb{R}$,\nthe Taylor series of $f$ at 0 is $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n x^n$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that for any formal power series $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n x^n$, there exists a $C^\\infty$ function $f$ such that the Taylor series of $f$ at 0 coincides with $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n x^n$.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are only about the existence of the power series and the smoothness of f, but I think the key points are covered.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the assumptions included both the variable type (integer) and an additional condition (divisible by 7). For the current problem, the power series is given (assumption 1), and the function is C^infty (assumption 2), and the Taylor series matches (assumption 3). But the problem is to prove existence given the power series. So maybe the assumptions should be:\n\n- Let $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n x^n$ be a formal power series with real coefficients.\n\nThen the problem is to prove there exists a C^infty function f such that its Taylor series is the given power series.\n\nBut according to the example's format, the assumptions list each condition. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n$\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n x^n$ is a formal power series,\n$f$ is a $C^\\infty$ function on $\\mathbb{R}$,\nthe Taylor series expansion of $f$ around 0 is $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n x^n$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that for every formal power series $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n x^n$, there exists a $C^\\infty$ function $f$ such that the Taylor series of $f$ at 0 is $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n x^n$.\n\nBut the problem is to prove existence, so the existence of f is part of the conclusion, not the assumption. Therefore, the assumptions should only be about the given power series. The example might have incorrectly included the conclusion as an assumption. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Maybe the user intended to modify the problem? For instance, maybe the original problem had a mistake, and the correct problem requires n to be divisible by 7. But regardless, following the user's example, perhaps the assumptions should include all the conditions that are given, even if they are part of the universal quantifier.\n\nIn the Borel theorem case, the problem is to show that for any power series (the assumption is that a power series is given), there exists a function f that is C^infty (this is part of the conclusion), whose Taylor series is the given power series. So the only assumption is the existence of the power series.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n$\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n x^n$ is a formal power series.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a $C^\\infty$ function $f$ such that the Taylor series of $f$ at 0 is $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n x^n$.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions list properties applied to one object each. So in the example, n is an integer, then n is divisible by 7. Here, the only object is the power series. Maybe the assumption is that the power series is given. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n$\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n x^n$ is a formal power series with real coefficients.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a $C^\\infty$ function $f$ such that the Taylor series of $f$ at 0 coincides with $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n x^n$.\n\nThis seems correct. The assumption is the existence of the power series, and the problem is to construct f. In the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, so the assumption was n is an integer. Here, the assumption is the power series is given.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem is as above.",
