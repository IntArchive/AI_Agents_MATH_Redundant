    "AcceptedAnswer":"(This is by no means a comprehensive and strict answer, just few observations I made). If you removed $0$ from the domain, the functions might be: $$f_0 (x) \\equiv -x$$\n$$g_0(x) \\equiv \\frac 1 x$$\n$$h(x) \\equiv -\\frac 1 x$$ Or better don't remove $0$ but allow $\\infty$ into the domain and the image, making each of them the projectively extended real line . This is interesting because if you take a broader look at complex numbers and their representation as the Riemann sphere , you will notice that: $f_0$ corresponds to rotating the sphere half turn, while the axis goes through $0$ and $\\infty$; $g_0$ is a similar rotation, the axis goes through $-1$ and $1$; $h$ is also a similar rotation, the axis goes through $-i$ and $i$. Rotating comes easy to my imagination so I will stick to this interpretation for a while, but we should remember that every half turn rotation is equivalent to some axial reflection. So in this case the three functions (and their compositions) correspond to certain operations (and their compositions) in 3D space where we imagine the Riemann sphere is. In general you could choose any three half turns with respect to mutually perpendicular axes. In this case however each of them must map the extended real line (which is a great circle on the Riemann sphere) onto itself. This means one of the axes must go through $-i$ and $i$, i.e. one of the functions must be our $h(x)$. If I did my calculations right, more general forms are ($\\alpha \\in \\mathbb R$): $$f_\\alpha (x) \\equiv \\frac {-x+\\alpha} {\\alpha x + 1},$$\n$$g_\\alpha (x) \\equiv \\frac {\\alpha x + 1} {x-\\alpha} $$\n$$h(x) \\equiv -\\frac 1 x$$ The following picture shows the projectively extended real line as a cross section of the Riemann sphere. Few possible axes are drawn. I said our functions correspond to certain reflections (or rotations) in 3D. Now in 2D the interpretation is: $f_\\alpha$ and $g_\\alpha$ correspond to reflections about certain axes; $h$ corresponds to the reflection through the point $S$ (or a half turn, if you wish). To me the most surprising conclusion is that: $$f_0 (x) \\equiv -x$$ and\n$$g_0(x) \\equiv \\frac 1 x$$ are more similar than I ever thought.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants to find three non-constant, pairwise unequal functions f, g, h from the real numbers to themselves such that when you compose them in a certain way, you get the other functions. Specifically, f∘g = h, g∘h = f, and h∘f = g. Additionally, these functions need to be continuous. If such functions don't exist, they need to be proven not to exist.\n\nFirst, let me restate the problem to make sure I understand it. We need three different functions (none of them constant), all continuous, such that composing f after g gives h, composing g after h gives f, and composing h after f gives g. The user suspects that no such functions exist but isn't sure how to prove it.\n\nLet me start by considering possible simple functions. Maybe linear functions? Suppose f, g, h are linear functions of the form f(x) = ax + b, g(x) = cx + d, h(x) = ex + f. Then composing them would involve substituting one into another. Let's try to see if such linear functions can satisfy the given conditions.\n\nFirst, compute f∘g. That would be f(g(x)) = a(cx + d) + b = acx + ad + b. According to the first equation, this should equal h(x) = ex + f. So we get ac = e and ad + b = f.\n\nSimilarly, g∘h = g(h(x)) = c(ex + f) + d = c e x + c f + d. This should equal f(x) = ax + b. So, c e = a and c f + d = b.\n\nThirdly, h∘f = h(f(x)) = e(ax + b) + f = e a x + e b + f. This should equal g(x) = cx + d. Therefore, e a = c and e b + f = d.\n\nNow we have a system of equations:\n\n1. ac = e\n2. ad + b = f\n3. ce = a\n4. cf + d = b\n5. ea = c\n6. eb + f = d\n\nLet me see if I can solve this system. Let's look at equations 1, 3, and 5. From equation 1: ac = e. From equation 3: ce = a. Substitute e from equation 1 into equation 3: c*(ac) = a => a c² = a. Assuming a ≠ 0 (since f is non-constant), we can divide both sides by a: c² = 1 => c = 1 or c = -1.\n\nSimilarly, from equation 5: ea = c. But from equation 1, e = a c. So substituting into equation 5: (a c) * a = c => a² c = c. If c ≠ 0, we can divide both sides by c: a² = 1 => a = 1 or a = -1.\n\nSo possibilities for a and c are:\n\nCase 1: c = 1. Then from a² = 1, a = 1 or a = -1.\n\nSubcase 1a: c = 1, a = 1.\n\nThen from equation 1: e = a c = 1*1 = 1.\n\nFrom equation 3: ce = 1*1 = 1 = a, which matches a=1.\n\nFrom equation 5: e a = 1*1 = 1 = c, which is correct since c=1.\n\nNow move to equations 2,4,6.\n\nEquation 2: ad + b = f. Since a=1, this is d + b = f.\n\nEquation 4: c f + d = 1*f + d = f + d = b.\n\nEquation 6: e b + f = 1*b + f = b + f = d.\n\nSo from equations 2 and 4:\n\nFrom equation 2: f = d + b.\n\nFrom equation 4: f + d = b. Substitute f from equation 2 into equation 4: (d + b) + d = b => 2d + b = b => 2d = 0 => d = 0.\n\nThen from equation 2: f = 0 + b => f = b.\n\nFrom equation 6: b + f = d = 0. But f = b, so b + b = 0 => 2b = 0 => b = 0.\n\nThus, f = b = 0. Then, since a=1 and b=0, f(x) = x. Similarly, c=1, d=0, so g(x) = x. Then h(x) = e x + f = 1*x + 0 = x. But this would make all three functions equal to the identity function, which violates the requirement that they are pairwise unequal. So this case doesn't work.\n\nSubcase 1b: c=1, a=-1.\n\nThen e = a c = (-1)(1) = -1.\n\nCheck equation 3: c e = 1*(-1) = -1 = a, which is correct (a=-1).\n\nEquation 5: e a = (-1)(-1) = 1 = c, which is c=1, correct.\n\nNow equations 2,4,6:\n\nEquation 2: a d + b = -1*d + b = f.\n\nEquation 4: c f + d = 1*f + d = f + d = b.\n\nEquation 6: e b + f = (-1)b + f = f - b = d.\n\nSo:\n\nFrom equation 4: f + d = b.\n\nFrom equation 2: -d + b = f.\n\nLet me substitute equation 4 into equation 2. From equation 4, f = b - d. Substitute into equation 2:\n\n-d + b = (b - d) => -d + b = b - d. This is an identity, so no new information.\n\nFrom equation 6: f - b = d. But from equation 4, f = b - d. Substitute into equation 6:\n\n(b - d) - b = d => -d = d => -d = d => 2d = 0 => d = 0.\n\nThen from equation 4: f + 0 = b => f = b.\n\nFrom equation 6: f - b = 0 => f = b. Which is the same.\n\nSo d=0, f=b. Then equation 2: -0 + b = f => b = f. Which is consistent.\n\nTherefore, we have a=-1, c=1, d=0, e=-1, f=b. The functions are:\n\nf(x) = -x + b,\n\ng(x) = x + 0 = x,\n\nh(x) = e x + f = -x + b.\n\nBut then f and h would be the same function: -x + b. This violates the pairwise unequal condition. Therefore, this case also doesn't work.\n\nCase 2: c = -1.\n\nFrom equation 1: e = a c = a*(-1).\n\nFrom equation 3: c e = (-1)*e = a. But e = -a, so (-1)*(-a) = a => a = a. This holds.\n\nFrom equation 5: e a = (-a)*a = -a² = c = -1. Therefore, -a² = -1 => a² = 1 => a=1 or a=-1.\n\nSo possibilities:\n\nSubcase 2a: c=-1, a=1.\n\nThen e = a c = 1*(-1) = -1.\n\nCheck equation 3: c e = (-1)(-1) = 1 = a, which holds (a=1).\n\nEquation 5: e a = (-1)(1) = -1 = c, correct.\n\nNow equations 2,4,6:\n\nEquation 2: a d + b = 1*d + b = d + b = f.\n\nEquation 4: c f + d = (-1)f + d = -f + d = b.\n\nEquation 6: e b + f = (-1)b + f = f - b = d.\n\nSo we have:\n\nFrom equation 2: f = d + b.\n\nFrom equation 4: -f + d = b.\n\nFrom equation 6: f - b = d.\n\nLet me substitute equation 2 into equation 4: -(d + b) + d = -d - b + d = -b = b => -b = b => 2b = 0 => b=0.\n\nThen from equation 2: f = d + 0 => f = d.\n\nFrom equation 6: f - 0 = d => f = d. So again, consistent.\n\nSo b=0, f=d. Then functions:\n\nf(x) = a x + b = 1*x + 0 = x,\n\ng(x) = c x + d = -x + d,\n\nh(x) = e x + f = -x + d.\n\nBut then h(x) = -x + d and g(x) = -x + d, so g and h are the same function. This violates the pairwise unequal condition. So this case is invalid.\n\nSubcase 2b: c=-1, a=-1.\n\nThen e = a c = (-1)(-1) = 1.\n\nCheck equation 3: c e = (-1)(1) = -1 = a, correct (a=-1).\n\nEquation 5: e a = (1)(-1) = -1 = c, correct.\n\nNow equations 2,4,6:\n\nEquation 2: a d + b = (-1)d + b = -d + b = f.\n\nEquation 4: c f + d = (-1)f + d = -f + d = b.\n\nEquation 6: e b + f = 1*b + f = b + f = d.\n\nSo:\n\nFrom equation 2: -d + b = f.\n\nFrom equation 4: -f + d = b.\n\nFrom equation 6: b + f = d.\n\nLet me substitute equation 2 into equation 4: -(-d + b) + d = d - b + d = 2d - b = b => 2d = 2b => d = b.\n\nFrom equation 6: b + f = d = b => f = 0.\n\nFrom equation 2: -d + b = f = 0. But d = b, so -b + b = 0 => 0=0, which holds.\n\nSo d = b, f=0.\n\nTherefore, functions:\n\nf(x) = -x + b,\n\ng(x) = -x + b,\n\nh(x) = e x + f = 1*x + 0 = x.\n\nBut then f and g are the same function, which is not allowed. So this case is invalid.\n\nTherefore, in all linear cases, either functions become equal or constant (if a=0, but a=0 would make f constant, which is not allowed). So linear functions don't work.\n\nHmm. Maybe trying to use functions other than linear? Maybe trigonometric functions? Let's think. Suppose f, g, h are trigonometric functions with some periodicity. For example, sine and cosine functions. However, composing trigonometric functions can lead to more complex functions, but maybe there's a way to set them up so that compositions cycle through each other.\n\nAlternatively, consider functions that are inverses of each other. If f is the inverse of g, then f∘g would be the identity function. But here, f∘g = h, so h would be the identity function. Then, g∘h = g∘id = g = f. So f and g would have to be the same function, which is not allowed. So inverses might not work here unless other conditions are met.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps using functions that are involutions, meaning f∘f = identity. But the problem requires a cycle of three functions. Maybe something like rotation, but over functions. For example, in cyclic groups, elements can have orders that divide the group order. But functions under composition don't form a group unless we consider bijections, and even then, it's complicated.\n\nWait, but the problem says the functions are from R to R, and they need to be continuous. If they were bijections, they would have to be strictly monotonic. But even then, composing them might not cycle in the desired way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using exponential functions? Let's see. Suppose f(x) = e^x, but composition of exponentials leads to exponentials with different exponents, which might not cycle into each other. For example, f∘g(x) = e^{g(x)}, which would need to equal h(x). Then g∘h(x) = g(h(x)) = f(x) = e^x. But unless g is a logarithm function, but logarithm is not continuous over all R, only defined for positive reals. Also, if we use log, the domain becomes an issue. Since the functions are from R to R, we need functions that are defined on all real numbers. So exponential functions might not work here.\n\nAlternatively, think of constant functions, but the problem states they must be non-constant. So that's out.\n\nPerhaps piecewise functions? But constructing continuous piecewise functions that satisfy the composition conditions might be tricky. Let's think of an example. Suppose we have functions that behave differently on different intervals but compose to each other. However, this seems vague. Let's try a specific approach.\n\nSuppose f, g, h are all the same function, but the problem requires them to be pairwise unequal. So that's not allowed.\n\nWait, but maybe functions that are permutations of each other. For instance, if f, g, h are permutations of R, but under composition, they cycle. However, continuous permutations of R are just strictly monotonic functions. Let's suppose f is increasing, g is decreasing, h is increasing, etc. But composing an increasing and decreasing function gives a decreasing function, then composing again might flip back. Let me try.\n\nSuppose f is increasing, g is decreasing, h is increasing. Then f∘g is decreasing (since f is increasing and g is decreasing), which would be h. But h is supposed to be increasing, contradiction. Similarly, if h is decreasing, but then the next composition would have to produce f which is increasing. Let's see:\n\nSuppose f is increasing, g is decreasing, h is decreasing.\n\nThen f∘g is decreasing (since f is increasing, g is decreasing), which would be h, which is decreasing. Then g∘h is g(decreasing function). If g is decreasing and h is decreasing, then g∘h is increasing. But g∘h should equal f, which is increasing. That works. Then h∘f is h(increasing). h is decreasing, so h∘f is decreasing, which should equal g, which is decreasing. That works. So maybe:\n\nIf f is increasing, g is decreasing, h is decreasing. Then compositions cycle as f∘g = h (decreasing), g∘h = f (increasing), h∘f = g (decreasing). Wait, but f∘g = h, which is decreasing; g∘h = f, which is increasing; h∘f = g, which is decreasing. But for h∘f to be g, which is decreasing, since h is decreasing and f is increasing, h∘f is decreasing, which matches. So this is possible in terms of monotonicity, but how do we define specific functions?\n\nSuppose f is the identity function (increasing), g is -x (decreasing), h is -x (decreasing). But then f∘g = -x = h, which is okay. g∘h = -(-x) = x = f, which is okay. h∘f = -x = g, which is okay. But here, g and h are the same function, which violates the pairwise unequal condition. So this doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, define h as a different decreasing function. Suppose f(x) = x, g(x) = -x + c, h(x) = -x + d, where c and d are constants. Then f∘g = -x + c = h => d = c. So again, h and g would be the same. Not allowed.\n\nHmm. Maybe if we use functions with different slopes. Suppose f(x) = x (increasing), g(x) = -2x (decreasing), h(x) = -2x + c. Then f∘g = -2x = h, so h(x) = -2x. Then g∘h = g(-2x + c) = -2*(-2x + c) = 4x - 2c. This should equal f(x) = x. So 4x - 2c = x => 4x - x = 2c => 3x = 2c. But this must hold for all x, which implies 3 = 0 and 2c = 0, which is impossible. Therefore, this approach fails.\n\nAlternatively, maybe affine functions with different coefficients. Let's try f(x) = ax + b, g(x) = cx + d, h(x) = ex + f, but as before, solving the system leads to contradictions or equal functions.\n\nWait, perhaps using functions other than affine. For example, cubic functions. Suppose f(x) = x^3, g(x) = -x, h(x) = -x^3. Then f∘g = (-x)^3 = -x^3 = h. g∘h = -(-x^3) = x^3 = f. h∘f = -(x^3) = -x^3 = g(x)? Wait, g(x) = -x, so unless -x^3 = -x for all x, which is not true. So that doesn't work. So h∘f would be -x^3, but g(x) is -x. These are not the same function. So this fails.\n\nAnother idea: use functions that are multiplicative inverses. For example, f(x) = kx, g(x) = (1\/k)x, but then compositions would give x, which is constant only if k=1, but then f and g are the same. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, consider functions that are rotations or reflections in some way. For example, complex functions, but the problem is about real functions. Maybe using periodicity. For instance, functions involving sine with phase shifts. Suppose f(x) = sin(x), g(x) = sin(x + a), h(x) = sin(x + b). But composing sine functions leads to more complex expressions, and it's unclear how to get them to cycle. For example, f∘g(x) = sin(sin(x + a)), which is not a simple sine function. This seems unlikely to work.\n\nAnother approach: Assume that all three functions are involutions, meaning that f∘f = identity, etc. But if f∘f = identity, and f∘g = h, then composing f∘g = h implies that h is f∘g. Then g∘h = f. Substitute h: g∘(f∘g) = f. But g∘f∘g = (g∘f)∘g. If g∘f is something, say k, then k∘g = f. Not sure if this helps. Maybe if f, g, h are all involutions, but even then, the composition relations may not hold.\n\nAlternatively, think of the functions as permutations of each other in a cycle. For example, f maps to h via composition with g, and so on. This is similar to cyclic groups. But functions under composition don't form a cyclic group unless specific conditions are met.\n\nAlternatively, consider that if we have f∘g = h, g∘h = f, h∘f = g, then composing all three functions in a cycle might lead to some identity. Let's see:\n\nStart with f∘g = h.\n\nThen compose both sides with f on the left: f∘h = f∘f∘g.\n\nBut from the third equation, h∘f = g, so f∘h = g^{-1}? Wait, but we don't know if g is invertible. Since the functions are continuous and non-constant, if they are strictly monotonic, they would be invertible. But maybe they're not necessarily invertible. However, if we assume they are bijections (which requires them to be strictly monotonic), then perhaps we can use inverses.\n\nAssuming all functions are invertible, then from h∘f = g, we can write h = g∘f^{-1}.\n\nSimilarly, from g∘h = f, substituting h from above: g∘(g∘f^{-1}) = f => g∘g∘f^{-1} = f => g∘g = f∘f.\n\nSimilarly, from f∘g = h = g∘f^{-1}, so f∘g = g∘f^{-1}.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to see if there's a relation here.\n\nIf we assume that all functions are invertible, then:\n\nFrom h = f∘g,\n\nFrom g∘h = f: g∘(f∘g) = f => (g∘f)∘g = f.\n\nApplying inverse of g on both sides (assuming it exists): g∘f = f∘g^{-1}.\n\nSimilarly, from h∘f = g: (f∘g)∘f = g => f∘g∘f = g.\n\nThis is a system of functional equations. It might be difficult to solve in general, but maybe we can look for solutions where the functions are linear and invertible, but as we saw earlier, linear functions don't work unless they are equal or lead to contradictions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider functions that are multiplicative. Let’s think of functions from R to R, but R under multiplication is a group only if we exclude zero, but the functions are defined on all R. Maybe using functions that preserve some structure.\n\nAlternatively, think of functions as permutations of real numbers with f, g, h forming a cycle of length 3. However, constructing explicit continuous functions that behave this way is non-trivial.\n\nAnother idea: Consider that the compositions form a cyclic permutation. For example, applying f three times brings you back to the original function. But the problem states a cycle of three functions, not a single function composed three times.\n\nAlternatively, think of the functions as satisfying f∘g = h, g∘h = f, h∘f = g. If we compose all three, like f∘g∘h, maybe we get some relation. Let's see:\n\nStart with f∘g = h.\n\nThen compose with h on the right: (f∘g)∘h = h∘h.\n\nBut f∘g∘h = h∘h.\n\nBut from g∘h = f, so f∘g∘h = f∘f.\n\nSimilarly, from h∘f = g, compose with g on the left: g∘h∘f = g∘g.\n\nBut g∘h = f, so f∘f = g∘g.\n\nSimilarly, from other compositions, we might get that f∘f = g∘g = h∘h.\n\nIf we assume that f, g, h are all involutions (f∘f = identity), then f∘f = g∘g = h∘h = identity. But then, from f∘g = h, composing both sides with f: g = f∘h.\n\nBut from h∘f = g, we have g = h∘f. So f∘h = h∘f. So f and h commute.\n\nSimilarly, from g∘h = f and h∘f = g, substituting g = h∘f into g∘h = f gives (h∘f)∘h = f => h∘f∘h = f.\n\nBut if f and h commute, then h∘f = f∘h, so h∘f∘h = f∘h∘h = f∘identity = f. Which works. So in this case, if f and h commute, and similarly for other pairs, perhaps this can hold.\n\nBut if f, g, h are involutions that commute, then we can have such relations. For example, consider three commuting involutions where each is the composition of the other two. However, finding such functions is challenging.\n\nWait, suppose we take f, g, h as identity functions, but they have to be unequal. Not allowed. Alternatively, in a vector space, but we are dealing with functions from R to R.\n\nAlternatively, consider functions that are linear transformations in higher dimensions, but since we are dealing with R to R, it's only 1-dimensional.\n\nWait, another thought: Suppose the functions are all the same function composed with itself in different orders. But since composition is not commutative, this might not work. For example, if f∘g = h, g∘h = f, h∘f = g, perhaps there's a symmetric property here. Maybe these functions form a cyclic group of order 3 under composition. But in order to have a cyclic group of order 3, each element composed three times would give the identity. But the problem doesn't specify that, just that the compositions cycle through each other.\n\nAlternatively, think of the functions as elements of a group where the composition order is cyclic. However, constructing such a group with continuous functions from R to R is difficult.\n\nGiven that linear functions don't work, maybe there are no such functions. But the user wants either to find them or prove they don't exist. The user suspects they don't exist. How to prove that?\n\nTo prove no such functions exist, one could assume that such functions exist and derive a contradiction. Let's attempt that.\n\nAssume f, g, h are continuous, non-constant, pairwise unequal functions satisfying:\n\n1. f∘g = h\n\n2. g∘h = f\n\n3. h∘f = g\n\nFirst, note that all functions must be non-constant and continuous. Let's analyze the properties of these functions.\n\nFrom 1 and 2: Substitute h from 1 into 2: g∘(f∘g) = f => (g∘f)∘g = f.\n\nLet’s denote id as the identity function. If g∘f were the identity, then (g∘f)∘g = g = f, which would imply g = f, contradicting pairwise inequality. So g∘f is not the identity.\n\nSimilarly, from 3: h∘f = g. Substitute h from 1: (f∘g)∘f = g => f∘g∘f = g.\n\nThis is a complicated functional equation. Maybe we can find a contradiction by considering the properties of continuous functions.\n\nAnother approach: consider the iterated compositions. Let's see what happens if we compose all three functions in some order.\n\nCompose f∘g∘h. From 1: f∘g = h, so f∘g∘h = h∘h.\n\nFrom 2: g∘h = f, so f∘g∘h = f∘f.\n\nThus, h∘h = f∘f.\n\nSimilarly, compose g∘h∘f. From 2: g∘h = f, so g∘h∘f = f∘f.\n\nFrom 3: h∘f = g, so g∘h∘f = g∘g.\n\nThus, f∘f = g∘g.\n\nSimilarly, compose h∘f∘g. From 3: h∘f = g, so h∘f∘g = g∘g.\n\nFrom 1: f∘g = h, so h∘f∘g = h∘h.\n\nThus, g∘g = h∘h.\n\nTherefore, we have f∘f = g∘g = h∘h.\n\nLet’s denote this common composition as k(x) = f∘f(x) = g∘g(x) = h∘h(x).\n\nNow, let's explore the implications. Suppose k(x) = f(f(x)) = g(g(x)) = h(h(x)).\n\nFrom the earlier equations:\n\nFrom f∘g = h, apply f to both sides: f∘f∘g = f∘h.\n\nBut f∘f = k, so k∘g = f∘h.\n\nBut from h∘f = g, we can write f∘h = f∘h = (from h∘f = g, then f∘h = f∘h = let's see, not sure).\n\nAlternatively, from h∘f = g, apply f to both sides: f∘h∘f = f∘g = h.\n\nBut f∘h∘f = h. Also, from above, k∘g = f∘h.\n\nSubstitute f∘h = k∘g into the previous equation: (k∘g)∘f = h.\n\nBut k∘g∘f = h.\n\nBut k = f∘f, so f∘f∘g∘f = h.\n\nBut f∘g = h, so f∘f∘g∘f = f∘h∘f = h.\n\nWait, this seems circular. Let me try a different approach.\n\nGiven that f∘f = g∘g = h∘h = k, and from the original equations:\n\n1. f∘g = h\n\n2. g∘h = f\n\n3. h∘f = g\n\nLet's compose equation 1 with f on the left: f∘f∘g = f∘h => k∘g = f∘h.\n\nFrom equation 3: h∘f = g => h = g∘f^{-1}? Wait, assuming invertibility. But f is continuous and non-constant, so if it's strictly monotonic, it's invertible. Let's assume all functions are invertible, which requires them to be strictly monotonic (since they're continuous and non-constant).\n\nIf f is invertible, then from h∘f = g => h = g∘f^{-1}.\n\nSimilarly, from g∘h = f, substituting h: g∘(g∘f^{-1}) = f => g∘g∘f^{-1} = f => (g∘g) = f∘f.\n\nBut g∘g = k and f∘f = k, so this holds.\n\nSimilarly, from f∘g = h, substituting h: f∘g = g∘f^{-1}.\n\nSo f∘g = g∘f^{-1}.\n\nLet’s apply f to both sides: f∘f∘g = f∘g∘f^{-1} => k∘g = h∘f^{-1}.\n\nBut from equation 3, h∘f = g => h = g∘f^{-1}, so h∘f^{-1} = g∘f^{-1}∘f^{-1} = g∘f^{-2}.\n\nWait, this might not be helpful. Let's try substituting h = g∘f^{-1} into k∘g = f∘h.\n\nFrom k∘g = f∘h => k∘g = f∘(g∘f^{-1}) => k∘g = (f∘g)∘f^{-1} => k∘g = h∘f^{-1}.\n\nBut h∘f^{-1} = g∘f^{-1}∘f^{-1} = g∘f^{-2}.\n\nSo k∘g = g∘f^{-2}.\n\nBut k = f∘f, so f∘f∘g = g∘f^{-2}.\n\nAssuming that f is invertible, we can apply g^{-1} to both sides:\n\nf∘f = g∘f^{-2}∘g^{-1}.\n\nThis is getting very convoluted. It's unclear if this approach will lead to a contradiction.\n\nAnother angle: consider the functional equations' impact on the derivatives, assuming the functions are differentiable. Since the problem only requires continuity, differentiability isn't guaranteed, but maybe assuming it could help find a contradiction.\n\nAssume f, g, h are differentiable. Then, differentiating both sides of the equations:\n\nFrom f(g(x)) = h(x), derivative is f’(g(x)) * g’(x) = h’(x).\n\nFrom g(h(x)) = f(x), derivative is g’(h(x)) * h’(x) = f’(x).\n\nFrom h(f(x)) = g(x), derivative is h’(f(x)) * f’(x) = g’(x).\n\nNow we have three equations:\n\n1. f’(g(x)) * g’(x) = h’(x)\n\n2. g’(h(x)) * h’(x) = f’(x)\n\n3. h’(f(x)) * f’(x) = g’(x)\n\nLet’s substitute recursively. From equation 1: h’(x) = f’(g(x)) * g’(x).\n\nSubstitute into equation 2: g’(h(x)) * [f’(g(x)) * g’(x)] = f’(x).\n\nSimilarly, from equation 3: g’(x) = h’(f(x)) * f’(x).\n\nSubstitute this into the above equation:\n\ng’(h(x)) * [f’(g(x)) * h’(f(x)) * f’(x)] = f’(x).\n\nSimplify:\n\ng’(h(x)) * f’(g(x)) * h’(f(x)) * f’(x) = f’(x).\n\nAssuming f’(x) ≠ 0 (since f is non-constant and invertible if strictly monotonic), we can divide both sides by f’(x):\n\ng’(h(x)) * f’(g(x)) * h’(f(x)) = 1.\n\nThis is a complicated equation involving the derivatives of all three functions evaluated at different points. It's unclear how to proceed, but perhaps considering specific forms could help.\n\nSuppose all derivatives are constants. Let’s assume f’(x) = a, g’(x) = b, h’(x) = c, where a, b, c are constants. Then:\n\nFrom equation 1: a * b = c.\n\nFrom equation 2: b * c = a.\n\nFrom equation 3: c * a = b.\n\nSo we have:\n\n1. ab = c\n\n2. bc = a\n\n3. ca = b\n\nSubstitute c = ab into equation 2: b*(ab) = a => a b² = a => b² = 1 (since a ≠ 0).\n\nThus, b = 1 or b = -1.\n\nCase 1: b = 1.\n\nThen from equation 1: a*1 = c => c = a.\n\nFrom equation 3: c*a = 1 => a*a = 1 => a² = 1 => a = 1 or a = -1.\n\nSubcase 1a: a = 1. Then c = 1.\n\nThus, f’(x) = 1 => f(x) = x + d.\n\ng’(x) = 1 => g(x) = x + e.\n\nh’(x) = 1 => h(x) = x + f.\n\nNow, f∘g(x) = f(g(x)) = (x + e) + d = x + (d + e) = h(x) = x + f. So d + e = f.\n\nFrom g∘h(x) = g(x + f) = (x + f) + e = x + (e + f) = f(x) = x + d. So e + f = d.\n\nFrom h∘f(x) = h(x + d) = (x + d) + f = x + (d + f) = g(x) = x + e. So d + f = e.\n\nNow we have three equations:\n\n1. d + e = f\n\n2. e + f = d\n\n3. d + f = e\n\nLet’s solve:\n\nFrom equation 1: f = d + e.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2: e + (d + e) = d => d + 2e = d => 2e = 0 => e = 0.\n\nThen from equation 1: f = d + 0 = d.\n\nFrom equation 3: d + d = e = 0 => 2d = 0 => d = 0.\n\nThus, f = 0, e = 0, d = 0.\n\nSo all functions are f(x) = x, g(x) = x, h(x) = x. But they are equal, which is not allowed.\n\nSubcase 1b: a = -1. Then c = -1.\n\nf’(x) = -1 => f(x) = -x + d.\n\ng’(x) = 1 => g(x) = x + e.\n\nh’(x) = -1 => h(x) = -x + f.\n\nNow, f∘g(x) = - (x + e) + d = -x - e + d = h(x) = -x + f. So -e + d = f.\n\nFrom g∘h(x) = g(-x + f) = (-x + f) + e = -x + (f + e) = f(x) = -x + d. So f + e = d.\n\nFrom h∘f(x) = h(-x + d) = -(-x + d) + f = x - d + f = g(x) = x + e. So -d + f = e.\n\nNow we have:\n\n1. -e + d = f\n\n2. f + e = d\n\n3. -d + f = e\n\nFrom equation 2: f = d - e.\n\nSubstitute into equation 1: -e + d = d - e => 0 = 0. No new info.\n\nFrom equation 3: -d + (d - e) = e => -e = e => e = 0.\n\nThen from equation 2: f = d - 0 = d.\n\nFrom equation 3: -d + d = 0 = e. So e = 0.\n\nThus, f(x) = -x + d, g(x) = x + 0 = x, h(x) = -x + d. But then f and h are the same function, which is invalid. So this case doesn't work.\n\nCase 2: b = -1.\n\nFrom equation 1: a*(-1) = c => c = -a.\n\nFrom equation 3: c*a = -1 => (-a)*a = -1 => -a² = -1 => a² = 1 => a = 1 or a = -1.\n\nSubcase 2a: a = 1. Then c = -1.\n\nThus, f’(x) = 1 => f(x) = x + d.\n\ng’(x) = -1 => g(x) = -x + e.\n\nh’(x) = -1 => h(x) = -x + f.\n\nNow, f∘g(x) = f(-x + e) = (-x + e) + d = -x + (e + d) = h(x) = -x + f. So e + d = f.\n\nFrom g∘h(x) = g(-x + f) = -(-x + f) + e = x - f + e = f(x) = x + d. So -f + e = d.\n\nFrom h∘f(x) = h(x + d) = - (x + d) + f = -x - d + f = g(x) = -x + e. So -d + f = e.\n\nNow, equations:\n\n1. e + d = f\n\n2. -f + e = d\n\n3. -d + f = e\n\nFrom equation 3: f = e + d.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2: - (e + d) + e = d => -e - d + e = d => -d = d => d = 0.\n\nThen from equation 3: f = e + 0 => f = e.\n\nFrom equation 1: e + 0 = e = f. So f = e.\n\nFrom equation 2: -e + e = 0 = d, which matches d=0.\n\nThus, functions are:\n\nf(x) = x,\n\ng(x) = -x + e,\n\nh(x) = -x + e.\n\nBut g and h are the same, which violates pairwise inequality. Invalid.\n\nSubcase 2b: a = -1. Then c = 1.\n\nf’(x) = -1 => f(x) = -x + d.\n\ng’(x) = -1 => g(x) = -x + e.\n\nh’(x) = 1 => h(x) = x + f.\n\nNow, f∘g(x) = - (-x + e) + d = x - e + d = h(x) = x + f. So -e + d = f.\n\nFrom g∘h(x) = g(x + f) = - (x + f) + e = -x - f + e = f(x) = -x + d. So -f + e = d.\n\nFrom h∘f(x) = h(-x + d) = (-x + d) + f = -x + (d + f) = g(x) = -x + e. So d + f = e.\n\nNow, equations:\n\n1. -e + d = f\n\n2. -f + e = d\n\n3. d + f = e\n\nFrom equation 3: e = d + f.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2: -f + (d + f) = d => d = d. Holds.\n\nFrom equation 1: -e + d = f => -(d + f) + d = f => -d - f + d = f => -f = f => f = 0.\n\nThen from equation 3: e = d + 0 => e = d.\n\nFrom equation 2: -0 + e = d => e = d. Which is consistent.\n\nThus, f(x) = -x + d,\n\ng(x) = -x + d,\n\nh(x) = x + 0 = x.\n\nBut f and g are the same, which is invalid. So this case also fails.\n\nTherefore, even assuming constant derivatives (i.e., affine functions) leads to contradictions where at least two functions are equal. Thus, no solution exists in the affine case.\n\nSince both linear\/affine attempts lead to contradictions, and given the constraints of continuity and non-constant, pairwise unequal functions, it's plausible that no such functions exist. To generalize this, perhaps we can use properties of continuous functions and functional equations to show a contradiction.\n\nAssume that such functions f, g, h exist. Since they are continuous and non-constant, each function is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing (by the Intermediate Value Theorem, continuous and injective functions are strictly monotonic). Let's consider their monotonicity.\n\nSuppose f is strictly increasing. Then, from f∘g = h, the composition's monotonicity depends on g. If g is increasing, then f∘g is increasing, so h is increasing. If g is decreasing, f∘g is decreasing, so h is decreasing.\n\nSimilarly, from g∘h = f. If h is increasing, g must be increasing to have g∘h increasing (since f is increasing). If h is decreasing, g must be decreasing to have g∘h increasing.\n\nLet's try to track the monotonicity:\n\nCase 1: f is increasing.\n\nFrom f∘g = h:\n\n- If g is increasing, then h is increasing.\n\nFrom g∘h = f (which is increasing):\n\n- If h is increasing, then g must be increasing.\n\nFrom h∘f = g:\n\n- If h is increasing and f is increasing, then h∘f is increasing, so g must be increasing.\n\nThus, if f is increasing, then g and h must also be increasing.\n\nBut let's see if this leads to a contradiction. Suppose all three are increasing.\n\nThen, f, g, h are strictly increasing continuous functions.\n\nFrom f∘g = h.\n\nSince all are increasing, they are invertible. Let’s denote their inverses as f^{-1}, g^{-1}, h^{-1}.\n\nFrom f∘g = h => g = f^{-1}∘h.\n\nFrom g∘h = f => (f^{-1}∘h)∘h = f^{-1}∘h∘h = f.\n\nThus, f^{-1}∘h∘h = f => h∘h = f∘f.\n\nSimilarly, from h∘f = g => h∘f = f^{-1}∘h.\n\nSo h∘f = f^{-1}∘h => h∘f∘h^{-1} = f^{-1}.\n\nThis is a functional equation. It’s unclear how to proceed, but perhaps consider specific properties.\n\nAlternatively, consider the growth rates of these functions. If f, g, h are all increasing, then their compositions will also be increasing. However, without specific forms, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, consider fixed points. Suppose there exists a fixed point x such that f(x) = x, g(x) = x, h(x) = x. But this isn't necessarily the case.\n\nAlternatively, assume that all three functions have a common fixed point. Let’s say x is such that f(x) = x, g(x) = x, h(x) = x. Then:\n\nFrom f∘g(x) = f(x) = x = h(x), which holds.\n\nFrom g∘h(x) = g(x) = x = f(x), holds.\n\nFrom h∘f(x) = h(x) = x = g(x), holds.\n\nBut this only shows that if they have a common fixed point, it’s consistent, but doesn’t help prove existence or non-existence.\n\nAlternatively, consider that since f∘g = h, g∘h = f, h∘f = g, composing all three gives:\n\nf∘g∘h = h∘h = f∘f = g∘g = k.\n\nSimilarly, g∘h∘f = f∘f = k.\n\nh∘f∘g = g∘g = k.\n\nBut again, this doesn’t immediately lead to a contradiction.\n\nAnother approach: use the fact that continuous functions on R with the composition form a semigroup, but without additional structure, it's difficult.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the existence of such functions would imply that the semigroup generated by f, g, h is finite (of order 3). But continuous functions generating finite semigroups are rare.\n\nGiven that in all specific cases we’ve tried (linear, affine), the only solutions require functions to be equal or constants, which are prohibited, and given the constraints of continuity and strict monotonicity, it's likely that no such functions exist. Therefore, the conclusion is that no three non-constant, pairwise unequal continuous functions f, g, h satisfy the given composition conditions.",
