Since the B_i's are independent, the MGF of their sum Y is the product of their individual MGFs:\n     \\[ M_Y(t) = \\prod_{i=n+1}^{n+m} M_{B_i}(t) = \\left[(1-p) + pe^t\\right]^m \\]\n     which is precisely the MGF of a Binomial(m, p) random variable.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since Y can be expressed as the sum of m i.i.d. Bernoulli(p) random variables, and both its PMF and MGF match those of a binomial distribution with parameters m and p, we conclude that Y ~ Binomial(m, p).\n\n**Note**: The independence of X and Y (Assumption 2) is not used in proving the marginal distribution of Y. It is only relevant if we were to consider the joint distribution of X and Y or properties of their sum.",
