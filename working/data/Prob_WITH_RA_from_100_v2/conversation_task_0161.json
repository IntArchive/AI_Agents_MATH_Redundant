For each $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$, define:\n\n1. $A_k = \\sup\\{a_n : n \\ge k\\}$\n2. $B_k = \\sup\\{b_n : n \\ge k\\}$\n3. $C_k = \\sup\\{(a_n + b_n) : n \\ge k\\}$\n\nWe aim to prove $C_k \\le A_k + B_k$.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the definitions**\nBy definition of supremum:\n- $A_k$ is the least upper bound of the set $\\{a_n : n \\ge k\\}$, meaning $a_n \\le A_k$ for all $n \\ge k$, and $A_k$ is the smallest number with this property.\n- $B_k$ is the least upper bound of the set $\\{b_n : n \\ge k\\}$, meaning $b_n \\le B_k$ for all $n \\ge k$, and $B_k$ is the smallest number with this property.\n- $C_k$ is the least upper bound of the set $\\{a_n + b_n : n \\ge k\\}$, meaning $a_n + b_n \\le C_k$ for all $n \\ge k$, and $C_k$ is the smallest number with this property.\n\n**Step 2: Upper bounds for individual terms**\nFor any fixed $n \\ge k$, since $A_k$ is an upper bound for $\\{a_m : m \\ge k\\}$, we have:\n\\[ a_n \\le A_k \\]\nSimilarly, since $B_k$ is an upper bound for $\\{b_m : m \\ge k\\}$, we have:\n\\[ b_n \\le B_k \\]\n\n**Step 3: Sum of the inequalities**\nAdding these two inequalities for the same $n \\ge k$, we obtain:\n\\[ a_n + b_n \\le A_k + B_k \\]\n\n**Step 4: $A_k + B_k$ is an upper bound**\nThe inequality $a_n + b_n \\le A_k + B_k$ holds for every $n \\ge k$. Therefore, $A_k + B_k$ is an upper bound for the set $\\{a_n + b_n : n \\ge k\\}$.\n\n**Step 5: Comparing with the supremum $C_k$**\nSince $C_k$ is defined as the supremum (least upper bound) of the set $\\{a_n + b_n : n \\ge k\\}$, and $A_k + B_k$ is an upper bound for this set, it follows that:\n\\[ C_k \\le A_k + B_k \\]\nThis is because the supremum is the smallest of all upper bounds. If $A_k + B_k$ is an upper bound, then the least upper bound $C_k$ cannot exceed it.\n\n**Step 6: Conclusion**\nWe have shown that for any $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $C_k \\le A_k + B_k$. This completes the proof.\n\n**Remark:** Note that the inequality is not necessarily an equality. For example, consider $a_n = (-1)^n$ and $b_n = (-1)^{n+1}$. Then for $k=1$, we have $A_1 = 1$, $B_1 = 1$, so $A_1 + B_1 = 2$, but $a_n + b_n = 0$ for all $n$, so $C_1 = 0 < 2 = A_1 + B_1$.",
