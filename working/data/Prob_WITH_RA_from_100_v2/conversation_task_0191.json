By definition, a function f: ℝ → ℝ is called odd if for every x in its domain ℝ, we have f(-x) = -f(x). Therefore, if f is odd, this equality holds for all x ∈ ℝ by definition.\n\nPart 2: (⇐) If f(-x) = -f(x) for all x ∈ ℝ, then f is odd.\n\nThis is essentially the converse of the definition. We need to verify that ℝ satisfies the necessary properties for the definition of an odd function to apply:\n\n1. Domain symmetry: The domain ℝ is symmetric about 0. That is, for any x ∈ ℝ, we have -x ∈ ℝ. This is true because ℝ is closed under negation.\n\n2. Functional equation: The condition f(-x) = -f(x) holds for all x ∈ ℝ by assumption.\n\nSince both conditions are satisfied, f meets the definition of an odd function.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that f is odd if and only if f(-x) = -f(x) for all x ∈ ℝ.\n\nNote: In practice, to prove a specific function f is odd, one typically:\n1. Verifies the domain is symmetric about 0 (ℝ satisfies this)\n2. Computes f(-x) for an arbitrary x ∈ ℝ\n3. Computes -f(x) for the same x\n4. Shows algebraically that f(-x) = -f(x)\n5. Concludes f is odd by definition.\n\nFor example, if f is defined by an explicit formula like f(x) = x³, then:\n- f(-x) = (-x)³ = -x³\n- -f(x) = -(x³) = -x³\n- Since f(-x) = -x³ = -f(x) for all x ∈ ℝ, f is odd.\n\nSimilarly, if f is defined by functional equations or properties, one uses algebraic manipulation to derive f(-x) = -f(x).",
