By Cauchy's integral formula for derivatives, for any $R > 0$, we have:\n$$f^{(n)}(0) = \\frac{n!}{2\\pi i} \\oint_{|z|=R} \\frac{f(z)}{z^{n+1}} dz$$\nwhere the integral is taken counterclockwise around the circle $|z| = R$.\n\nStep 2: Apply the ML inequality (also known as the estimation lemma) to bound the integral. The ML inequality states that for a contour integral $\\oint_\\gamma g(z) dz$, we have $\\left|\\oint_\\gamma g(z) dz\\right| \\leq L \\cdot M$, where $L$ is the length of the contour and $M$ is the maximum value of $|g(z)|$ on the contour.\n\nFor our integral:\n- The integrand is $\\frac{f(z)}{z^{n+1}}$\n- On the circle $|z| = R$, we have $|z^{n+1}| = R^{n+1}$\n- Let $M(R) = \\max_{|z|=R} |f(z)|$ be the maximum modulus of $f$ on the circle $|z| = R$\n- Then on $|z| = R$, $\\left|\\frac{f(z)}{z^{n+1}}\\right| \\leq \\frac{M(R)}{R^{n+1}}$\n- The length of the contour $|z| = R$ is $2\\pi R$\n\nApplying the ML inequality:\n$$\\left|\\oint_{|z|=R} \\frac{f(z)}{z^{n+1}} dz\\right| \\leq (2\\pi R) \\cdot \\frac{M(R)}{R^{n+1}} = \\frac{2\\pi M(R)}{R^n}$$\n\nStep 3: Combine with Cauchy's formula from Step 1:\n$$|f^{(n)}(0)| = \\left|\\frac{n!}{2\\pi i} \\oint_{|z|=R} \\frac{f(z)}{z^{n+1}} dz\\right| = \\frac{n!}{2\\pi} \\left|\\oint_{|z|=R} \\frac{f(z)}{z^{n+1}} dz\\right| \\leq \\frac{n!}{2\\pi} \\cdot \\frac{2\\pi M(R)}{R^n} = \\frac{n!

In particular, for sufficiently large $R$, on the circle $|z| = R$, we have $|f(z)| \\leq kR^n$ for all $z$ with $|z| = R$.\n\nTherefore, for sufficiently large $R$, the maximum modulus satisfies:\n$$M(R) = \\max_{|z|=R} |f(z)| \\leq kR^n$$\n\nStep 5: Substitute this bound into the inequality from Step 3.
