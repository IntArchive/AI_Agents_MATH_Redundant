Here's a standard proof:\n\nLet me write the proof:\n\nSince √2 is irrational, the set S = {m + n√2 : m, n ∈ ℤ} is dense in ℝ. One way to prove this is to consider the fractional parts of multiples of √2.\n\nConsider the sequence {n√2} (fractional part of n√2) for n = 1, 2, 3, ... Since √2 is irrational, these fractional parts are all distinct and lie in [0,1). By the pigeonhole principle, for any ε > 0, there exist integers n₁ < n₂ such that |{n₂√2} - {n₁√2}| < ε.\n\nThen (n₂ - n₁)√2 = (⌊n₂√2⌋ - ⌊n₁√2⌋) + ({n₂√2} - {n₁√2}), so\n(n₂ - n₁)√2 - (⌊n₂√2⌋ - ⌊n₁√2⌋) = {n₂√2} - {n₁√2} ∈ (-ε, ε)\n\nLet m = -(⌊n₂√2⌋ - ⌊n₁√2⌋) and n = n₂ - n₁. Then m + n√2 ∈ (-ε, ε). By taking k(m + n√2) for sufficiently large k, we can get a positive element in (0, ε).\n\nAlternatively, a more direct proof: Consider α = √2 - 1 ≈ 0.414. Since |α| < 1, α^n → 0 as n → ∞. Note that α^n = (√2-1)^n can be written in the form m_n + n_n√2 for some integers m_n, n_n (by binomial expansion). As n → ∞, α^n → 0, so for any ε > 0, there exists n such that 0 < α^n < ε, giving an element of S in (0, ε).\n\n**Step 8: Final answer in JSON format**\n\nBased on my analysis, assumption 3 is redundant.
