By definition of a magic square, all rows, all columns, and both main diagonals sum to this same constant $M$.\n\n**Step 2: Compute the total sum of all entries in two ways.**\nFirst, consider the three rows of the magic square. Since each row sums to $M$, the sum of all entries in the magic square is $M + M + M = 3M$.\n\nSecond, by assumption, the magic square contains each of the integers $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9$ exactly once. Therefore, the sum of all entries is also equal to $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9$.\n\nThus we have the equation:\n\\[ 3M = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9. \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the sum $1+2+\\ldots+9$.**\nWe compute the sum of the first nine positive integers using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\n\\[ S_n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}, \\]\nwhere $n$ is the number of terms. Here $n = 9$, so\n\\[ 1 + 2 + \\ldots + 9 = \\frac{9 \\cdot (9+1)}{2} = \\frac{9 \\cdot 10}{2} = \\frac{90}{2} = 45. \\]\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the proof.**\nSubstituting the computed sum into the equation from Step 2 gives\n\\[ 3M = 45. \\]\nSolving for $M$ yields $M = 15$, which is the well‑known magic constant for a $3 \\times 3$ magic square using the numbers $1$ through $9$.\n\nMore importantly, the derivation shows directly that\n\\[ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45, \\]\nwhich is exactly the statement we were asked to prove.\n\n**Remark.** The proof does not require knowing the specific arrangement of numbers within the magic square; it only uses the defining property that each row sums to the same constant $M$ and that the nine entries are precisely the integers $1,\\dots,9$. The calculation of the sum via the arithmetic series formula is elementary and completes the argument.",
