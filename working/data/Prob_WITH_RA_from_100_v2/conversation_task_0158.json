We need to prove f(a) = b ⇔ (a,b) ∈ f.\n\nFirst, we analyze the consequences of our assumptions:\n\n1. Since B = ∅, by assumption (5), we have A × B = ∅.\n\n2. Since F ⊆ A × B and A × B = ∅, we must have F = ∅ (the empty set).\n\n3. The domain of F, denoted dom(F), is the set {x ∈ A : ∃y ∈ B such that (x,y) ∈ F}. Since F = ∅, there are no ordered pairs (x,y) ∈ F, so dom(F) = ∅.\n\n4. Now consider the statement f(a) = b. By definition, f(a) = b means that b is the unique element of B such that (a,b) ∈ f. More formally, f(a) = b is equivalent to: (a,b) ∈ f and for all b' ∈ B, if (a,b') ∈ f then b' = b.\n\n5. Since B = ∅, there are no elements b ∈ B. Therefore, for any a ∈ A, the statement \"∃y ∈ B such that (a,y) ∈ f\" is false.\n\n6. From assumption (4): For every x ∈ dom F, there exists exactly one y ∈ B such that (x,y) ∈ F. Since B = ∅, the only way this statement can be true is if dom F = ∅ (which we already established). If there were any x ∈ dom F, we would need to find y ∈ B, but B has no elements, leading to a contradiction.\n\n7. Since A ≠ ∅ and dom F = ∅, for any a ∈ A, we have a ∉ dom F.\n\n8. When a ∉ dom F, the notation f(a) is undefined in the usual sense. However, in formal logic, we can interpret the statement f(a) = b as: ∃!y∈B[(a,y)∈f] ∧ that y = b, where ∃! means \"there exists a unique\".\n\n9. Since B = ∅, the statement ∃y∈B[(a,y)∈f] is false for all a ∈ A. Therefore, the entire statement f(a) = b is false for all a ∈ A and all b ∈ B (or for any b, since there are no b ∈ B, but we consider b as a variable).\n\n10. Now consider the statement (a,b) ∈ f. Since f = ∅, there are no ordered pairs in f. Therefore, (a,b) ∈ f is false for all a ∈ A and all b ∈ B.\n\n11. We have established that for all a ∈ A and all b ∈ B (or for any a and b under consideration), both f(a) = b and (a,b) ∈ f are false.\n\n12. In propositional logic, when both sides of an equivalence are false, the equivalence is true.
