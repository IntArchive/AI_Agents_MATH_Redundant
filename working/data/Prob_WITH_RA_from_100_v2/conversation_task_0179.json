        "mathematician and proof writer": "Assumption:\nAssumption 1: $f$ is a function from $\\mathbb{C}$ to $\\mathbb{C} \\setminus \\{a, b\\}$\nAssumption 2: $f$ is holomorphic\nAssumption 3: $a$ and $b$ are two distinct complex numbers\nProblem:\nProve that $f'(d) - f'(0) = \\frac{d}{2\\pi i} \\int_{|w|= r} \\frac{f'(w)}{w(w-d)} \\,dw$\nWe provide a detailed proof of the given identity using complex analysis techniques, particularly the residue theorem.\n\n**Step 1: Properties of $f$ and $f'$**\nSince $f$ is holomorphic on $\\mathbb{C}$ (an entire function), its derivative $f'$ is also holomorphic on $\\mathbb{C}$. This follows from the fact that the derivative of a holomorphic function is holomorphic. Therefore, $f'$ is an entire function.\n\n**Step 2: Define the integrand function**\nConsider the function $h: \\mathbb{C} \\setminus \\{0, d\\} \\to \\mathbb{C}$ defined by\n$$h(w) = \\frac{f'(w)}{w(w-d)}.$$\nSince $f'$ is entire and the denominator $w(w-d)$ is analytic except at $w=0$ and $w=d$, the function $h$ is meromorphic with simple poles at $w=0$ and $w=d$ (provided $f'(0) \\neq 0$ and $f'(d) \\neq 0$; if either is zero, the pole might be of lower order, but the residue calculation will still be valid as shown below).\n\n**Step 3: Choose appropriate contour**\nLet $r > \\max(|d|, 0)$. This ensures that the circle $\\gamma = \\{w \\in \\mathbb{C}: |w| = r\\}$ encloses both points $0$ and $d$ in its interior. The contour $\\gamma$ is positively oriented (counterclockwise).\n\n**Step 4: Apply the residue theorem**\nSince $h$ is meromorphic inside and on $\\gamma$ with isolated singularities at $w=0$ and $w=d$, the residue theorem gives\n$$\\int_{|w|=r} h(w) \\, dw = 2\\pi i \\left[ \\operatorname{Res}(h, 0) + \\operatorname{Res}(h, d) \\right].$$\n\n**Step 5: Compute the residues**\nWe compute the residues at the simple poles:\n\n1. **Residue at $w=0$:**\n   Since $w=0$ is a simple pole of $h$, we have\n   $$\\operatorname{Res}(h, 0) = \\lim_{w \\to 0} w \\cdot h(w) = \\lim_{w \\to 0} w \\cdot \\frac{f'(w)}{w(w-d)} = \\lim_{w \\to 0} \\frac{f'(w)}{w-d} = \\frac{f'(0)}{0-d} = -\\frac{f'(0)}{d}.$$\n   The limit exists because $f'$ is continuous (being holomorphic).\n\n2. **Residue at $w=d$:**\n   Similarly, $w=d$ is a simple pole, so\n   $$\\operatorname{Res}(h, d) = \\lim_{w \\to d} (w-d) \\cdot h(w) = \\lim_{w \\to d} (w-d) \\cdot \\frac{f'(w)}{w(w-d)} = \\lim_{w \\to d} \\frac{f'(w)}{w} = \\frac{f'(d)}{d}.$$\n   Again, the limit exists by continuity of $f'$.\n\n**Step 6: Substitute residues into residue theorem**\nSubstituting the computed residues into the residue theorem formula:\n$$\\int_{|w|=r} \\frac{f'(w)}{w(w-d)} \\, dw = 2\\pi i \\left[ -\\frac{f'(0)}{d} + \\frac{f'(d)}{d} \\right] = \\frac{2\\pi i}{d} \\left[ f'(d) - f'(0) \\right].$$\n\n**Step 7: Rearrange to obtain desired formula**\nMultiplying both sides by $\\frac{d}{2\\pi i}$ gives\n$$\\frac{d}{2\\pi i} \\int_{|w|=r} \\frac{f'(w)}{w(w-d)} \\, dw = f'(d) - f'(0).$$\n\nEquivalently,\n$$f'(d) - f'(0) = \\frac{d}{2\\pi i} \\int_{|w|=r} \\frac{f'(w)}{w(w-d)} \\, dw.$$\n\n**Step 8: Remarks on special cases**\n- If $d = 0$, the formula reduces to $0 = 0$, which is trivially true.\n- If $f'(0) = 0$ or $f'(d) = 0$, the poles at $0$ or $d$ might be removable singularities rather than simple poles. However, the residue calculations above remain valid because the limits still exist and yield the same expressions. For example, if $f'(0)=0$, then $\\operatorname{Res}(h,0) = 0$, which matches $-f'(0)/d = 0$.\n- The condition $r > \\max(|d|, 0)$ ensures both singularities are inside the contour; any larger $r$ would work as well due to Cauchy's theorem (since $h$ is analytic for $|w| > \\max(|d|, 0)$ except at infinity).\n\n**Conclusion:** We have proved the identity\n$$f'(d) - f'(0) = \\frac{d}{2\\pi i} \\int_{|w|=r} \\frac{f'(w)}{w(w-d)} \\, dw$$\nfor any entire function $f$, any $d \\in \\mathbb{C}$, and any $r > \\max(|d|, 0)$.",
