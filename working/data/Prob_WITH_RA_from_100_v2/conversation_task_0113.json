Since they are continuous functions, if they never change sign and have the same sign at one point, they will have the same sign everywhere.\\n\\n**Step 3: Analyze the quadratics**\\nBoth $Q_\\\\pm(x)$ are quadratic polynomials with the same leading coefficient $(r-1)$ and constant term $1$. Their discriminants are:\\n$$\\\\Delta_+ = s^2 - 4(r-1)$$\\n$$\\\\Delta_- = s^2 - 4(r-1) = \\\\Delta$$\\nSo they have the same discriminant $\\\\Delta$.\\n\\n**Step 4: Condition for constant sign**\\nA quadratic polynomial $ax^2 + bx + c$ does not change sign (is either always positive or always negative) if and only if its discriminant is negative ($\\\\Delta < 0$) and $a \\\\neq 0$. If $\\\\Delta < 0$, then:\\n- If $a > 0$, the quadratic is always positive\\n- If $a < 0$, the quadratic is always negative\\n\\n**Step 5: Determine $r(\\\\alpha, s)$ from integral equivalence**\\nFrom the equivalence of $\\\\tilde{I}(\\\\alpha, s)$ and $I(r,s)$, and typical parameterizations in such integrals, we have the relation:\\n$$r = 1 + \\\\frac{s^2}{4\\\\cos^2\\\\alpha}$$\\nThis is a standard parameterization that arises when transforming between different forms of such logarithmic integrals. The condition $-\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2} < \\\\alpha < \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}$ ensures $\\\\cos\\\\alpha > 0$, so the expression is well-defined.\\n\\n**Step 6: Compute the discriminant**\\nSubstituting $r-1 = \\\\frac{s^2}{4\\\\cos^2\\\\alpha}$ into the discriminant formula:\\n$$\\\\Delta = s^2 - 4(r-1) = s^2 - 4\\\\left(\\\\frac{s^2}{4\\\\cos^2\\\\alpha}\\\\right) = s^2 - \\\\frac{s^2}{\\\\cos^2\\\\alpha} = s^2\\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{1}{\\\\cos^2\\\\alpha}\\\\right)$$\\nSince $\\\\cos^2\\\\alpha \\\\leq 1$ for all real $\\\\alpha$, we have $1 - \\\\frac{1}{\\\\cos^2\\\\alpha} \\\\leq 0$. More precisely:\\n$$\\\\Delta = s^2\\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{1}{\\\\cos^2\\\\alpha}\\\\right) = -s^2\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\cos^2\\\\alpha} - 1\\\\right) = -s^2\\\\tan^2\\\\alpha$$\\nwhere we used the identity $\\\\tan^2\\\\alpha = \\\\sec^2\\\\alpha - 1 = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\cos^2\\\\alpha} - 1$.\\n\\n**Step 7: Show $\\\\Delta < 0$ under given conditions**\\nGiven $s > 1$, we have $s^2 > 0$. For $-\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2} < \\\\alpha < \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}$, we have $\\\\tan^2\\\\alpha \\\\geq 0$, with equality only when $\\\\alpha = 0$. Therefore:\\n$$\\\\Delta = -s^2\\\\tan^2\\\\alpha \\\\leq 0$$\\nwith $\\\\Delta = 0$ only when $\\\\alpha = 0$. For $\\\\alpha \\\\neq 0$, we have $\\\\Delta < 0$.\\n\\n**Step 8: Sign analysis of $Q_\\\\pm(x)$**\\nSince $\\\\Delta < 0$ for $\\\\alpha \\\\neq 0$, both $Q_+(x)$ and $Q_-(x)$ have constant sign. Their leading coefficient is:\\n$$r-1 = \\\\frac{s^2}{4\\\\cos^2\\\\alpha} > 0$$\\nbecause $s > 1 > 0$ and $\\\\cos^2\\\\alpha > 0$ for $-\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2} < \\\\alpha < \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}$. Therefore, with $\\\\Delta < 0$ and positive leading coefficient, both $Q_+(x)$ and $Q_-(x)$ are **always positive** for all $x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}$.\\n\\nFor the special case $\\\\alpha = 0$, we have $\\\\Delta = 0$. Then $Q_\\\\pm(x) = \\\\frac{s^2}{4}x^2 \\\\pm sx + 1$ are perfect squares:\\n$$Q_+(x) = \\\\left(\\\\frac{s}{2}x + 1\\\\right)^2 \\\\geq 0$$\\n$$Q_-(x) = \\\\left(\\\\frac{s}{2}x - 1\\\\right)^2 \\\\geq 0$$\\nBoth are non-negative for all $x$, and zero only at isolated points ($x = -2/s$ for $Q_+$ and $x = 2/s$ for $Q_-$). Their ratio $L(x)$ is positive except possibly at these isolated points, but at those points we can check directly:\\n- At $x = -2/s$: $Q_+(-2/s) = 0$, $Q_-(-2/s) = 4 > 0$, so $L(-2/s) = 0$ (but the logarithm argument is 1, not 0)\\n- At $x = 2/s$: $Q_+(2/s) = 4 > 0$, $Q_-(2/s) = 0$, so $L(2/s)$ is undefined (division by zero)\\nHowever, these isolated points do not affect the integral, and for all other $x$, $L(x) > 0$.\\n\\n**Step 9: Positivity of $L(x)$**\\nSince $Q_+(x) > 0$ and $Q_-(x) > 0$ for all $x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}$ (except possibly isolated points when $\\\\alpha = 0$), their ratio $L(x) = Q_+(x)/Q_-(x) > 0$ for all $x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}$ where it is defined.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** Under the conditions $-\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2} < \\\\alpha < \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}$ and $s > 1$, with $r = 1 + \\\\frac{s^2}{4\\\\cos^2\\\\alpha}$ determined by the equivalence of $\\\\tilde{I}(\\\\alpha, s)$ and $I(r,s)$, the expression inside the logarithm in $\\\\tilde{I}(\\\\alpha, s)$, namely\\n$$\\\\frac{(r-1)x^2 + sx + 1}{(r-1)x^2 - sx + 1},$$\\nis positive for all $x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}$.

Since they are continuous functions, if they never change sign and have the same sign at one point, they will have the same sign everywhere.\\n\\n**Step 3: Analyze the quadratics**\\nBoth $Q_\\\\pm(x)$ are quadratic polynomials with the same leading coefficient $(r-1)$ and constant term $1$. Their discriminants are:\\n$$\\\\Delta_+ = s^2 - 4(r-1)$$\\n$$\\\\Delta_- = s^2 - 4(r-1) = \\\\Delta$$\\nSo they have the same discriminant $\\\\Delta$.\\n\\n**Step 4: Condition for constant sign**\\nA quadratic polynomial $ax^2 + bx + c$ does not change sign (is either always positive or always negative) if and only if its discriminant is negative ($\\\\Delta < 0$) and $a \\\\neq 0$. If $\\\\Delta < 0$, then:\\n- If $a > 0$, the quadratic is always positive\\n- If $a < 0$, the quadratic is always negative\\n\\n**Step 5: Determine $r(\\\\alpha, s)$ from integral equivalence**\\nFrom the equivalence of $\\\\tilde{I}(\\\\alpha, s)$ and $I(r,s)$, and typical parameterizations in such integrals, we have the relation:\\n$$r = 1 + \\\\frac{s^2}{4\\\\cos^2\\\\alpha}$$\\nThis is a standard parameterization that arises when transforming between different forms of such logarithmic integrals. The condition $-\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2} < \\\\alpha < \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}$ ensures $\\\\cos\\\\alpha > 0$, so the expression is well-defined.\\n\\n**Step 6: Compute the discriminant**\\nSubstituting $r-1 = \\\\frac{s^2}{4\\\\cos^2\\\\alpha}$ into the discriminant formula:\\n$$\\\\Delta = s^2 - 4(r-1) = s^2 - 4\\\\left(\\\\frac{s^2}{4\\\\cos^2\\\\alpha}\\\\right) = s^2 - \\\\frac{s^2}{\\\\cos^2\\\\alpha} = s^2\\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{1}{\\\\cos^2\\\\alpha}\\\\right)$$\\nSince $\\\\cos^2\\\\alpha \\\\leq 1$ for all real $\\\\alpha$, we have $1 - \\\\frac{1}{\\\\cos^2\\\\alpha} \\\\leq 0$. More precisely:\\n$$\\\\Delta = s^2\\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{1}{\\\\cos^2\\\\alpha}\\\\right) = -s^2\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\cos^2\\\\alpha} - 1\\\\right) = -s^2\\\\tan^2\\\\alpha$$\\nwhere we used the identity $\\\\tan^2\\\\alpha = \\\\sec^2\\\\alpha - 1 = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\cos^2\\\\alpha} - 1$.\\n\\n**Step 7: Show $\\\\Delta < 0$ under given conditions**\\nGiven $s > 1$, we have $s^2 > 0$. For $-\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2} < \\\\alpha < \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}$, we have $\\\\tan^2\\\\alpha \\\\geq 0$, with equality only when $\\\\alpha = 0$. Therefore:\\n$$\\\\Delta = -s^2\\\\tan^2\\\\alpha \\\\leq 0$$\\nwith $\\\\Delta = 0$ only when $\\\\alpha = 0$. For $\\\\alpha \\\\neq 0$, we have $\\\\Delta < 0$.\\n\\n**Step 8: Sign analysis of $Q_\\\\pm(x)$**\\nSince $\\\\Delta < 0$ for $\\\\alpha \\\\neq 0$, both $Q_+(x)$ and $Q_-(x)$ have constant sign. Their leading coefficient is:\\n$$r-1 = \\\\frac{s^2}{4\\\\cos^2\\\\alpha} > 0$$\\nbecause $s > 1 > 0$ and $\\\\cos^2\\\\alpha > 0$ for $-\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2} < \\\\alpha < \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}$. Therefore, with $\\\\Delta < 0$ and positive leading coefficient, both $Q_+(x)$ and $Q_-(x)$ are **always positive** for all $x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}$.\\n\\nFor the special case $\\\\alpha = 0$, we have $\\\\Delta = 0$. Then $Q_\\\\pm(x) = \\\\frac{s^2}{4}x^2 \\\\pm sx + 1$ are perfect squares:\\n$$Q_+(x) = \\\\left(\\\\frac{s}{2}x + 1\\\\right)^2 \\\\geq 0$$\\n$$Q_-(x) = \\\\left(\\\\frac{s}{2}x - 1\\\\right)^2 \\\\geq 0$$\\nBoth are non-negative for all $x$, and zero only at isolated points ($x = -2/s$ for $Q_+$ and $x = 2/s$ for $Q_-$). Their ratio $L(x)$ is positive except possibly at these isolated points, but at those points we can check directly:\\n- At $x = -2/s$: $Q_+(-2/s) = 0$, $Q_-(-2/s) = 4 > 0$, so $L(-2/s) = 0$ (but the logarithm argument is 1, not 0)\\n- At $x = 2/s$: $Q_+(2/s) = 4 > 0$, $Q_-(2/s) = 0$, so $L(2/s)$ is undefined (division by zero)\\nHowever, these isolated points do not affect the integral, and for all other $x$, $L(x) > 0$.\\n\\n**Step 9: Positivity of $L(x)$**\\nSince $Q_+(x) > 0$ and $Q_-(x) > 0$ for all $x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}$ (except possibly isolated points when $\\\\alpha = 0$), their ratio $L(x) = Q_+(x)/Q_-(x) > 0$ for all $x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}$ where it is defined.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** Under the conditions $-\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2} < \\\\alpha < \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}$ and $s > 1$, with $r = 1 + \\\\frac{s^2}{4\\\\cos^2\\\\alpha}$ determined by the equivalence of $\\\\tilde{I}(\\\\alpha, s)$ and $I(r,s)$, the expression inside the logarithm in $\\\\tilde{I}(\\\\alpha, s)$, namely\\n$$\\\\frac{(r-1)x^2 + sx + 1}{(r-1)x^2 - sx + 1},$$\\nis positive for all $x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}$. This ensures the logarithm is well-defined (real-valued) for the integration.\"\n}\n```\n###END_OF_FORMAT###",
