    "Content":"My sister just asked this question to me: \"Is an irrational number odd or even?\" I told her that decimals are not odd or even and that does imply that not recurring and non repeating decimals will also not be odd or even. But I want a rigorous math proof for this. Can someone help me with this proof? Also, can I do this proof by contradiction?",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"Definition. Let $n\\in \\mathbb{Z}$ be an integer. $n$ is called even if ... According to the definition only integers are even or odd. It is not something that you have to prove.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let's tackle this question: \"Is an irrational number odd or even?\" The user wants a rigorous math proof showing that irrational numbers can't be classified as odd or even. They also mentioned using proof by contradiction. Alright, first, I need to recall the definitions of odd and even numbers. \n\nSo, even numbers are integers divisible by 2, and odd numbers are integers that aren't divisible by 2. The key here is that parity (being odd or even) is a property of integers. But irrational numbers aren't integers; they can't be expressed as a ratio of two integers. So, if someone tries to assign parity to an irrational number, that's outside the standard definitions.\n\nBut how to structure this into a formal proof? The user suggested proof by contradiction. Let's try that approach. Suppose, for contradiction, that there exists an irrational number that is either odd or even. If it's even, then by definition, it should be divisible by 2, meaning it's an integer. But that contradicts the fact that it's irrational. Similarly, if it's odd, then adding 1 would make it even, which would also have to be an integer, leading to the same contradiction. Therefore, our assumption must be wrong, so no irrational number can be odd or even.\n\nWait, but do we need to be more precise here? Maybe we should state that parity is defined only for integers. So, if a number is not an integer, the question of parity doesn't apply. Therefore, since irrational numbers are not integers (except in cases where they are, but wait, no—irrational numbers are real numbers that aren't rational. So integers are rational. So an irrational number can't be an integer. Therefore, any irrational number is non-integer. Hence, parity concepts don't apply. Therefore, the question is moot because parity is a property exclusive to integers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the definitions more formally. Let me check: The standard definitions of even and odd numbers apply to integers. For example, an even integer is n = 2k where k is an integer, and an odd integer is n = 2k + 1. Therefore, if a number is not an integer, it cannot be expressed in either form, since k must be an integer. Hence, non-integers don't have parity.\n\nSo putting this together, the assumptions would involve the definitions of even and odd numbers being restricted to integers, and the fact that irrational numbers are not integers. Then the problem is to show that irrationals can't be classified as odd or even.\n\nWait, the original question had the user's sister asking if an irrational number is odd or even, and the user responded that decimals aren't odd or even. But maybe the sister was confused because some decimals (terminating ones) are rational, but not integers. But even non-integer rationals aren't considered odd or even. For example, 0.5 is a rational number but not an integer, so it's not odd or even. So actually, the key point is that parity is for integers, not for real numbers in general. Therefore, any number not an integer (whether rational or irrational) can't be odd or even.\n\nBut the problem specifically mentions irrational numbers. So maybe the answer should focus on the fact that irrationals aren't integers, hence parity doesn't apply. Therefore, the proof by contradiction would assume that an irrational number is even or odd, which by definition requires it to be an integer, contradicting its irrationality.\n\nTherefore, structuring this into the required format:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The concepts of \"odd\" and \"even\" apply only to integers.\n- An irrational number is a real number that cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers.\n- If a number is even, it can be written as 2k where k is an integer.\n- If a number is odd, it can be written as 2k + 1 where k is an integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that an irrational number cannot be classified as odd or even.\n\nAlternatively, in the problem statement, maybe the problem is to show that the question of parity (odd\/even) does not apply to irrational numbers. So the assumptions would include the definitions of parity and irrational numbers. The problem is to prove that an irrational number is neither odd nor even.\n\nBut in the example given by the user, the assumptions list each condition applied to one object. So for example, in the original example, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So each line addresses one property of one object.\n\nIn this case, the key assumptions would be:\n\n- The properties \"odd\" and \"even\" are defined for integers.\n- An irrational number is a real number that is not a rational number.\n- A rational number can be expressed as a quotient of two integers.\n- An integer is a rational number with denominator 1.\n- If a real number is even, then it is an integer divisible by 2.\n- If a real number is odd, then it is an integer not divisible by 2.\n\nBut maybe that's too detailed. Let me simplify. The key points are:\n\n1. Parity (odd\/even) is a property of integers.\n2. Irrational numbers are not integers.\n\nTherefore, any assumption list should include these two points. Then the problem is to prove that an irrational number cannot be odd or even.\n\nBut how to phrase each assumption as one line per object? So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe properties \"odd\" and \"even\" apply only to integers.\nAn irrational number is a real number that cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers.\nAn integer is a rational number with denominator 1.\nIf a number is even, it is divisible by 2.\nIf a number is odd, it is not divisible by 2.\n\nWait, but maybe the key is that evenness and oddness require the number to be an integer. So:\n\nAssumption:\nAn even number is an integer divisible by 2.\nAn odd number is an integer not divisible by 2.\nAn irrational number is a real number that is not rational.\nA rational number can be expressed as a\/b where a and b are integers with b ≠ 0.\n\nBut perhaps the problem can be structured with the necessary assumptions and then the problem statement. Let me check the user's example again. In their example, the original problem had A(n) defined, and the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, leading to the problem to prove A(n) divisible by 91.\n\nSo in this case, the problem is about parity of irrational numbers, which requires the assumptions that parity applies to integers, and irrationals are not integers. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe properties \"odd\" and \"even\" are defined for integers.\nAn irrational number is not an integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that an irrational number cannot be odd or even.\n\nAlternatively, since the original question mentions decimals not being odd or even, but the key point is that parity is for integers. So structuring it accordingly.",

    "mathematician and proof writer":"Assumption:\nAssumption 1: The concepts of \"odd\" and \"even\" are defined exclusively for integers\nAssumption 2: An irrational number is a real number that cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers\nProblem:\nProve that $n\\in \\mathbb{Z}$\nWe will prove that irrational numbers cannot be classified as odd or even by following these logical steps:\n\nStep 1: By Assumption 1, the concepts of 'odd' and 'even' are defined exclusively for integers. This means that only integers can be classified as odd or even. Formally, for any number x, if x is classified as odd or even, then x must be an integer.\n\nStep 2: By Assumption 2, an irrational number is a real number that cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers. This implies that irrational numbers are not integers. To see why: every integer n can be expressed as n\/1, which is a ratio of two integers (n and 1). Therefore, all integers are rational numbers. Since irrational numbers are, by definition, not rational, they cannot be integers.\n\nStep 3: From Step 1, we know that only integers can be odd or even. From Step 2, we know that irrational numbers are not integers. Therefore, by logical deduction, irrational numbers cannot be classified as odd or even. More formally: Let I be the set of irrational numbers, Z be the set of integers, and O be the set of numbers that can be classified as odd or even. Step 1 tells us that O ⊆ Z (all odd\/even numbers are integers). Step 2 tells us that I ∩ Z = ∅ (irrational numbers and integers are disjoint sets). Therefore, I ∩ O = ∅ (irrational numbers and odd\/even numbers are disjoint).\n\nStep 4: We conclude that the classification of numbers as odd or even does not apply to irrational numbers. This means that for any irrational number r, it is meaningless to ask whether r is odd or even, just as it is meaningless to ask whether a geometric shape is 'prime' or whether a color is 'divisible by 3'—these are categories that simply do not apply to objects of that type.\n\nThus, we have proven that irrational numbers cannot be classified as odd or even.",
