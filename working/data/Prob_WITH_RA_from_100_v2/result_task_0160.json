    "Content":"How to show that $x^4+1$ is irreducible in $\\mathbb Z[x]$ but it is reducible modulo every prime $p$? For example I know that $x^4+1=(x+1)^4\\bmod 2$. Also $\\bmod 3$ we have that $0,1,2$ are not solutions of $x^4+1=0$ then if it is reducible the factors are of degree $2$. This gives that $x^4+1=(x^2+ax+b)(x^2+cx+d)$ and solving this system of equations $\\bmod 3$  gives that $x^4+1=(x^2+x+2) (x^2+2x+2) \\pmod 3$. But is there a simpler method to factor $x^4+1$ modulo a prime $p$?",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"For every odd prime $p$ we have $8\\mid p^2-1$. The multiplicative group of the finite field $F=GF(p^2)$ is cyclic of order $p^2-1$. Putting these two bits together tells us that there is a primitive root $u$ of order $8$ in $F$. We must have $u^4=-1$, because $-1$ is the only element of multiplicative order two. Because $F$ is a quadratic extension of $\\mathbf{Z}\/p\\mathbf{Z}$, the minimal polynomial of $u$ is of degree $\\le 2$. That minimal polynomial is then a factor of \n$$x^4+1=(x-u)(x-u^3)(x-u^5)(x-u^7)=(x-u)(x-u^3)(x+u)(x+u^3).$$ ==================== Edit: Here's an idea for finding the factorization. I split it into cases according to the residue class of $p$ modulo 8. Assume first that $p\\equiv 1\\pmod 4$ (or $p$ equivalent to $1$ or $5$ modulo 8). In that case all we need is a square root $i$ of $-1$ modulo $p$. IIRC there is an algorithm for finding two integers $x,y$ such that $p=x^2+y^2$, and then $i=x*y^{-1}$ is the desired square root in the prime field $F_p=GF(p)$. A factorization is then\n$$\nx^4+1=(x^2+i)(x^2-i).\n$$\nObserve that if $p\\equiv1\\pmod8$ then both quadratic factors will split further. If $p\\equiv 3\\pmod 8$, then $u$ is not in the prime field, and its conjugate is $u^p=u^3$. Therefore the minimal polynomial is\n$$\nm(x)=(x-u)(x-u^p)=(x-u)(x-u^3)=x^2-[u+u^3]x + u^4= x^2-ax-1,\n$$\nwhere $a$ is some unknown element of the prime field. Because $u^5=-u$ and $u^7=-u^3$, the other factor of $x^4+1$ must be $m(-x)=x^2+ax-1$. We need to find the coefficient $a$.\nLet's multiply\n$$\n(x^2-ax-1)(x^2+ax-1)=(x^2-1)^2-a^2x^2=x^4-(2+a^2)x^2+1.\n$$\nWe see that we have found the factorization, if we can find $a=\\sqrt{-2}$. It is well known that when $p\\equiv 3\\pmod 8$, then $-2$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$ confirming our finding. In the last case $p\\equiv 7\\pmod8$ the minimal polynomial of $u$ over $F_p$ is\n$$\nm(x)=(x-u)(x-u^p)=(x-u)(x-u^7)=x^2-[u+u^7]x+u^8=x^2-bx+1\n$$\nfor some $b\\in F_p$. Again the other factor is $m(-x)$, and a similar calculation shows that we need $b=\\sqrt{2}$. Again this fits together with the known fact that in this case $2$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$. ================== Edit(2): TonyK described the following methods for finding the square roots. They depend on the fact that if $p$ is an odd prime, and $gcd(a,p)=1$, then $a^{(p-1)\/2}\\equiv\\pm1\\pmod p$. Here we have the plus sign, if and only if $a$ is a quadratic residue (=QR) modulo $p$. If $p\\equiv 3\\pmod8$, then we know that $2$ is not a QR modulo $p$. Therefore\n$2^{(p-1)\/2}\\equiv -1\\pmod p$. Hence $2^{(p+1)\/2}\\equiv -2\\pmod p$. But here $(p+1)\/2$ is an even integer, so writing $z=2^{(p+1)\/4}$ we get $z^2\\equiv 2^{(p+1)\/2}\\equiv -2$, and we have found a square root of $-2$. Similarly, if $p\\equiv 7\\pmod 8$, we know that $2$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$. This time $2^{(p+1)\/2}\\equiv 2$, and the same calculation shows that $z=2^{(p+1)\/4}$ is a square root of $2$ in $F_p$. If $p\\equiv 5\\pmod 8$, then again $2$ is not a QR modulo $p$, so $2^{(p-1)\/2}\\equiv -1\\pmod p$ and $(p-1)\/2$ is even. Thus $z=2^{(p-1)\/4}$ is a square root of $-1$. If $p\\equiv 1\\pmod 8$, then we cannot use $2$ (but could use any non-QR in its place, or the method mentioned earlier).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user is asking two things: first, to show that \\( x^4 + 1 \\) is irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z}[x] \\) (meaning it can't be factored into lower-degree polynomials with integer coefficients), and second, to prove that it becomes reducible modulo every prime \\( p \\). They also mentioned wanting a simpler method to factor it modulo primes.\n\nStarting with the irreducibility over \\( \\mathbb{Z}[x] \\). I remember that for cyclotomic polynomials, \\( x^4 + 1 \\) is the 8th cyclotomic polynomial. Cyclotomic polynomials are irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\), which by Gauss's lemma implies they're also irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\). So maybe that's the route. Alternatively, perhaps trying to factor it into quadratics or cubics and showing it's impossible.\n\nSuppose \\( x^4 + 1 \\) factors into quadratics: \\( (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d) \\). Expanding gives \\( x^4 + (a + c)x^3 + (ac + b + d)x^2 + (ad + bc)x + bd \\). Setting coefficients equal to \\( x^4 + 1 \\), we get:\n\n1. \\( a + c = 0 \\)\n2. \\( ac + b + d = 0 \\)\n3. \\( ad + bc = 0 \\)\n4. \\( bd = 1 \\)\n\nFrom equation 1, \\( c = -a \\). Plugging into equation 4, since \\( bd = 1 \\), possible integer solutions are \\( b = 1, d = 1 \\) or \\( b = -1, d = -1 \\). Let's try \\( b = 1, d = 1 \\). Then equation 2 becomes \\( -a^2 + 1 + 1 = 0 \\Rightarrow -a^2 + 2 = 0 \\Rightarrow a^2 = 2 \\). But \\( a \\) must be integer, so no solution. Similarly, if \\( b = -1, d = -1 \\), equation 2 becomes \\( -a^2 -1 -1 = 0 \\Rightarrow -a^2 -2 = 0 \\), which is impossible. Hence, no quadratic factors. Similarly, trying linear factors would require roots, but \\( x^4 +1 =0 \\) has roots which are 8th roots of unity, not integers, so no linear factors over \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\). Thus, irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\).\n\nNow for reducibility modulo every prime \\( p \\). The user showed examples mod 2 and 3. For mod 2, \\( x^4 +1 = (x+1)^4 \\). For mod 3, they factored into two quadratics. The question is how to do this in general. Maybe using properties of finite fields. For a prime \\( p \\), in \\( \\mathbb{F}_p[x] \\), \\( x^4 +1 \\) factors depending on the value of \\( p \\) modulo 8. Because the polynomial splits into linear or quadratic factors based on the multiplicative order of certain elements.\n\nAlternatively, since \\( x^4 +1 = (x^2 + \\sqrt{2}x +1)(x^2 - \\sqrt{2}x +1) \\), but in finite fields, square roots exist depending on the field. For primes where 2 is a quadratic residue, this would factor. But 2 is a quadratic residue mod p if \\( p \\equiv \\pm1 \\mod 8 \\). Wait, but maybe another approach: \\( x^4 +1 = (x^2 +1)^2 - 2x^2 = (x^2 - \\sqrt{2}x +1)(x^2 + \\sqrt{2}x +1) \\). So if 2 is a square in \\( \\mathbb{F}_p \\), then this factors into quadratics. If not, maybe another method. Also, \\( x^4 +1 \\) divides \\( x^8 -1 \\), so it's related to the 8th roots of unity. In a field \\( \\mathbb{F}_p \\), the multiplicative group is cyclic of order \\( p-1 \\), so if 8 divides \\( p-1 \\), then there are primitive 8th roots, so \\( x^4 +1 \\) splits into linear factors. If not, maybe into quadratics. Wait, but regardless of the prime, it seems reducible. Let's check primes:\n\nCase 1: p=2. As shown, \\( x^4 +1 = (x+1)^4 \\).\n\nCase 2: p is odd. If p ≡ 1 mod 8, then 8 divides p-1, so multiplicative group has elements of order 8, hence x^4 +1 splits into linear factors.\n\nIf p ≡ 3,5,7 mod 8, then 8 doesn't divide p-1. For example, p ≡ 3 mod 4, then p ≡ 3 mod 8 or 7 mod 8. Wait, perhaps need to check:\n\nFor primes where p ≡ 1 mod 8: splits into 4 linear factors.\n\np ≡ 5 mod 8: Then 8 divides p^2 -1, since p^2 ≡ 25 ≡ 1 mod 8, so p^2 -1 ≡ 0 mod 8. So in the field extension \\( \\mathbb{F}_{p^2} \\), the multiplicative group has order p^2 -1, which is divisible by 8, so there are 8th roots of unity. Therefore, the polynomial x^4 +1 factors into quadratics over \\( \\mathbb{F}_p \\).\n\nSimilarly, for p ≡ 3 mod 8, p^2 ≡ 9 ≡ 1 mod 8, so same as above. So in these cases, x^4 +1 factors into quadratics over \\( \\mathbb{F}_p \\). Hence, modulo any prime, x^4 +1 is reducible.\n\nBut how to give a simple method for factoring? Maybe note that for any prime p, either -1 is a quadratic residue or not. Wait, but -1 is a quadratic residue mod p if p ≡ 1 mod 4. Hmm, maybe not directly. Alternatively, use the fact that in any field, x^4 +1 factors as (x^2 + ax +1)(x^2 - ax +1) if there exists an a such that a^2 = 2. Alternatively, if 2 is a square, which is when p ≡ ±1 mod 8. If 2 is not a square, maybe another approach. Wait, but if 2 is not a square, perhaps -2 is a square? Let's see: For example, when p=3, 2 is not a square (since 1^2=1, 2^2=4≡1 mod 3), but -2 ≡1 mod 3, which is a square. Wait, but in p=3, 1 is a square. Wait, maybe that's not the way. Alternatively, note that x^4 +1 = (x^2 +1)^2 - 2x^2, so if 2 is a square, then it factors as difference of squares. If not, maybe factors another way. Alternatively, x^4 +1 = (x^4 + 2x^2 +1) - 2x^2 = (x^2 +1)^2 - (√2 x)^2, so if 2 is a square, factor as (x^2 +√2 x +1)(x^2 -√2 x +1). If 2 is not a square, then maybe use other methods. Wait, but for primes where 2 is not a square, maybe use that x^4 +1 can be written as (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d). However, solving for coefficients might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, for primes where p ≡ 3 mod 4, then -1 is not a quadratic residue. But x^4 +1 can be factored as (x^2 + sqrt(-1))(x^2 - sqrt(-1)), but if sqrt(-1) doesn't exist, then maybe combine into quadratics. Wait, in p ≡ 3 mod 4, -1 is not a quadratic residue, so sqrt(-1) isn't in F_p. But then, x^4 +1 factors into quadratics as (x^2 + sqrt(-1))(x^2 - sqrt(-1)) over F_p^2. But over F_p, maybe as (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d). Let's take p=3, as in the example. The user found x^4 +1 factors as (x^2 +x +2)(x^2 +2x +2). Multiply them out: x^4 + (1+2)x^3 + (2 + 2 + 4)x^2 + (4 + 2)x + 4. Wait, modulo 3, coefficients:\n\nFirst term: x^4.\n\nSecond term: (1+2)x^3 = 0x^3.\n\nThird term: (2 +2 +4)x^2 = 8x^2 ≡ 2x^2 mod 3.\n\nFourth term: (4 +2)x = 6x ≡ 0x mod3.\n\nConstant term: 4 ≡1 mod3. So total: x^4 +2x^2 +1. But x^4 +1 is x^4 +1. Wait, but 2x^2 ≡ -x^2 mod3. So x^4 -x^2 +1. Hmm, not the same as x^4 +1. Wait, maybe the user's example is incorrect? Wait, let's check:\n\nOriginal problem statement says: In mod3, x^4 +1 factors as (x^2 +x +2)(x^2 +2x +2). Let's multiply these:\n\n(x^2 +x +2)(x^2 +2x +2) = x^4 +2x^3 +2x^2 +x^3 +2x^2 +2x +2x^2 +4x +4.\n\nCombine terms modulo3:\n\nx^4 + (2+1)x^3 + (2+2+2)x^2 + (2+4)x +4\n\n= x^4 +0x^3 + (6)x^2 +6x +4\n\n= x^4 +0x^3 +0x^2 +0x +1\n\n= x^4 +1. Yes, correct. So in this case, the cross terms cancel out. Interesting. So perhaps there's a general method where for primes not congruent to 1 mod8, you can still find such factorizations. Maybe by trying to set up the equations for the coefficients and solve them in F_p. Alternatively, use the fact that x^4 +1 splits into quadratic factors if the field has a certain extension degree.\n\nBut the user is asking for a simpler method. Maybe note that x^4 +1 = x^4 - (-1), and so over F_p, if -1 is a square, say -1 = a^2, then x^4 +1 = (x^2 +a)(x^2 -a). If -1 is not a square, then maybe factor into quadratics (x^2 +ax +b)(x^2 +cx +d). Alternatively, use the fact that for any prime p, either 2 is a square, -2 is a square, or something else. Wait, perhaps using the identity x^4 +1 = (x^2 + sqrt(2)x +1)(x^2 - sqrt(2)x +1) when 2 is a square, and another identity when 2 is not a square. For example, if -1 is a square, then factor as (x^2 + sqrt(-1))(x^2 - sqrt(-1)), but that would require sqrt(-1) to exist. For primes p ≡1 mod4, -1 is a quadratic residue, so this would work. But if p ≡3 mod4, then -1 is not a residue. But in that case, maybe use another method. Alternatively, note that x^4 +1 factors as (x+1)^4 when p=2. For odd primes, perhaps use the fact that in F_p, x^4 +1 divides x^8 -1, which splits into linear factors if 8 divides p-1 or into quadratic factors otherwise. So depending on p mod8:\n\n- If p ≡1 mod8, splits into 4 linear factors.\n\n- If p ≡5 mod8, splits into two quadratics.\n\n- If p ≡3 or7 mod8, splits into two quadratics.\n\nWait, but how to see this? Maybe using the fact that the order of 2 modulo p affects the factorization. Alternatively, considering the field extensions. If the multiplicative order of 2 modulo p is k, then in F_p, x^4 +1 factors accordingly. But this might be too advanced. Maybe a simpler way is to note that for any odd prime p, either 2 is a quadratic residue or not. If 2 is a quadratic residue (i.e., p ≡ ±1 mod8), then x^4 +1 factors into (x^2 + sqrt(2)x +1)(x^2 - sqrt(2)x +1). If 2 is not a quadratic residue, then -2 is a quadratic residue (since the product of two non-residues is a residue; if p ≡3,5 mod8, then 2 is a non-residue, but -1 is a non-residue if p ≡3 mod4. So p ≡3 mod8: -2 is a residue? Let me check. For p=3, -2 ≡1 mod3, which is a residue. For p=5, -2=3 mod5, which is a non-residue since 3 is a quadratic non-residue mod5. Wait, maybe this approach isn't consistent.\n\nAlternatively, use the identity x^4 +1 = (x^2 + ax +1)(x^2 -ax +1) with a such that a^2 =2. If 2 is a square, done. If not, try a different substitution. For instance, if we can find some a such that a^2 = -2, then x^4 +1 = (x^2 + ax -1)(x^2 -ax -1). Let's check:\n\n(x^2 + ax -1)(x^2 -ax -1) = x^4 -a x^3 -x^2 +a x^3 -a^2 x^2 -a x -x^2 +a x +1 = x^4 + (-1 -a^2 -1)x^2 +1. So middle term is (-2 -a^2)x^2. For this to equal x^4 +1, we need -2 -a^2 =0, so a^2 = -2. Therefore, if -2 is a square in F_p, then this factorization works. So if p ≡1,3 mod8, then either 2 or -2 is a square, allowing such a factorization.\n\nBut how does this relate to p modulo 8? Let's recall that 2 is a quadratic residue mod p iff p ≡ ±1 mod8. So for p ≡ ±1 mod8, 2 is a square, so factor as (x^2 + sqrt(2)x +1)(x^2 - sqrt(2)x +1). For p ≡3,5 mod8, 2 is not a square, but -1 is a non-residue when p ≡3 mod4 (i.e., p ≡3,7 mod8). Wait, p ≡5 mod8 is ≡1 mod4, so -1 is a residue there. So for p ≡5 mod8, since 2 is a non-residue but -1 is a residue, maybe combine them. Let's see, if p ≡5 mod8, then 2 is a non-residue, but -2 is also a non-residue? Because (-2\/p) = (-1\/p)(2\/p). For p ≡5 mod8, (-1\/p) =1 (since 5≡1 mod4) and (2\/p) = -1, so (-2\/p)= -1. So -2 is a non-residue. Hmm. So maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that x^4 +1 splits into quadratic factors for any p. For example, in F_p, if there exists an element a such that a^2 = -1, then x^4 +1 = (x^2 +a)(x^2 -a). If not, then find a different way. Wait, but even if a^2 = -1 doesn't exist, the polynomial might still factor into quadratics with different coefficients.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to note that for any prime p, x^4 +1 is reducible modulo p. This can be shown by considering that in F_p[x], x^4 +1 divides x^8 -1, which splits into linear factors since the multiplicative group of F_p is cyclic of order p-1. So the roots of x^8 -1 are the 8th roots of unity. Depending on whether 8 divides p-1, the polynomial x^8 -1 will split into linear factors, so x^4 +1 factors accordingly. If 8 doesn't divide p-1, then the factors are of higher degree. Wait, but if 8 doesn't divide p-1, then the multiplicative order of elements in F_p is a divisor of p-1, so the 8th roots of unity lie in an extension field. But since x^4 +1 is a factor of x^8 -1, its splitting field is an extension of degree dividing 2. Therefore, x^4 +1 factors into quadratic factors over F_p.\n\nHence, regardless of p, x^4 +1 factors modulo p into linear or quadratic factors. Therefore, it is reducible modulo every prime p.\n\nPutting this together, the assumptions and problem are as follows:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The polynomial in question is \\( x^4 + 1 \\).\n- The polynomial is considered in \\( \\mathbb{Z}[x] \\).\n- For reducibility modulo primes, consider all prime numbers \\( p \\).\n\nProblem:\n- Prove that \\( x^4 + 1 \\) is irreducible in \\( \\mathbb{Z}[x] \\).\n- Prove that \\( x^4 + 1 \\) is reducible modulo every prime \\( p \\).",

Comparing this with our derived expression $x^4 - (2+a^2)x^2 + 1$, we see that for these to be equal, the coefficient of $x^2$ must be zero:\n$-(2 + a^2) = 0$\n\nSolving for $a^2$:\n$2 + a^2 = 0$\n$a^2 = -2$\n\nThis shows that when $a^2 = -2$, the factorization $(x^2-ax-1)(x^2+ax-1)$ becomes a factorization of $x^4 + 1$:\n$x^4 + 1 = (x^2-ax-1)(x^2+ax-1)$ where $a^2 = -2$\n\nThis factorization is particularly relevant for studying the reducibility of $x^4 + 1$ modulo different primes $p$, as the existence of such a factorization depends on whether $-2$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$ (i.e., whether there exists an integer $a$ such that $a^2 \\equiv -2 \\pmod{p}$).\n\nThus, we have proven the polynomial identity and established its connection to the polynomial $x^4 + 1$ and its reducibility modulo primes.",
