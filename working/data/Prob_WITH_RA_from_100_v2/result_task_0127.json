    "Content":"Let $R$ be a finite ring with unity. Prove that every nonzero element of $R$ is either a unit or a zero-divisor.",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"In a finite commutative ring with unity, every element is either a unit or a zero-divisor. Indeed, let $a\\in R$ and consider the map on $R$ given by $x \\mapsto ax$ . If this map is injective then it has to be surjective, because $R$ is finite. Hence, $1=ax$ for some $x\\in R$ and $a$ is a unit. If the map is not injective then there are $u,v\\in R$ , with $u\\ne v$ , such that $au=av$ . But then $a(u-v)=0$ and $u-v\\ne0$ and so $a$ is a zero divisor. For the noncommutative case, see this answer .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nThe original problem is about proving that in a finite ring with unity, every nonzero element is either a unit or a zero divisor. Let me parse the problem statement carefully. \n\nFirst, the problem states that R is a finite ring with unity. So the assumptions here would be: R is a ring, R has a unity element, and R is finite. Each of these should be separate points. Then, the problem asks to prove that every nonzero element is either a unit or a zero-divisor. \n\nWait, the original problem might not explicitly state all the assumptions. Let me check again. The problem says \"Let R be a finite ring with unity.\" So the assumptions are: R is a finite ring, R has unity. The problem is to prove that every nonzero element in R is either a unit or a zero-divisor. \n\nBut in the example provided, the user included assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem included \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, but that example might be incorrect. Wait, looking back, the original problem in the example says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n)...\" but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the example? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be a mistake. But perhaps the example was structured differently. Hmm.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user wants to structure the problem as Assumptions and Problem. So for the given problem: \"Let R be a finite ring with unity. Prove that every nonzero element of R is either a unit or a zero-divisor.\"\n\nSo the assumptions here are:\n\n1. R is a ring.\n2. R is finite.\n3. R has unity.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. Then the problem is to prove that every nonzero element is a unit or a zero-divisor. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"R is a finite ring with unity\" can be split into two assumptions: R is finite and R has unity. Because a ring can be finite without having unity, but here it's specified that R has unity. So the assumptions are:\n\n- R is a ring.\n- R is finite.\n- R has a unity element.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that every nonzero element in R is either a unit or a zero-divisor.\n\nI think that's correct. Each assumption is a single property applied to R. So three assumptions here. Then the problem statement follows. The example in the user's request had two assumptions for n, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So maybe the user included some extra assumption. But in the current problem, the problem statement is straightforward. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem: \"Let R be a finite ring with unity. Prove that every nonzero element of R is either a unit or a zero-divisor.\"\n\nBreaking down the assumptions:\n\n- R is a ring. (Since it's stated as a ring)\n- R is finite. (Given)\n- R has unity. (Given)\n\nProblem statement: Prove that every nonzero element of R is either a unit or a zero-divisor.\n\nSo the formatted answer should list those three assumptions and then the problem. That's the structure. Each assumption is a single property. I think that's correct.",

    "proof strategy planner":"Assumption:\nAssumption 1: R is a ring\nAssumption 2: R is finite\nAssumption 3: R has a unity element\nProblem:\nProve that 1 = ax\nProof sketch: \nStep 1) Let R be a finite ring with unity 1. Let a ∈ R be a nonzero element that is not a zero divisor.\nStep 2) Consider the function f: R → R defined by f(x) = ax. Show f is injective: if ax = ay, then a(x-y) = 0, and since a is not a zero divisor, x-y = 0, so x = y.\nStep 3) Since R is finite and f is injective, f is also surjective by the pigeonhole principle.\nStep 4) Since f is surjective, there exists x ∈ R such that f(x) = ax = 1. Thus a has a right inverse.\nStep 5) Similarly, consider g: R → R defined by g(x) = xa. Show g is injective (since a is not a zero divisor), hence surjective, so there exists y ∈ R with ya = 1.\nStep 6) The right inverse x and left inverse y must be equal: y = y(ax) = (ya)x = x. Therefore a is a unit with inverse x = y.",
    "mathematician and proof writer":"Assumption:\nAssumption 1: R is a ring\nAssumption 2: R is finite\nAssumption 3: R has a unity element\nProblem:\nProve that 1 = ax\nWe are given: R is a finite ring with unity element 1, and a ∈ R is a nonzero element that is not a zero divisor. We need to prove that there exists x ∈ R such that ax = 1.\n\nStep 1: Define the function f: R → R by f(x) = ax for all x ∈ R.\n\nStep 2: Show that f is injective. Suppose f(x) = f(y) for some x, y ∈ R. Then ax = ay. Subtracting ay from both sides gives a(x - y) = 0. Since a is not a zero divisor and a ≠ 0, the equation a(x - y) = 0 implies x - y = 0. Therefore x = y, proving f is injective.\n\nStep 3: Since R is finite and f: R → R is injective, by the pigeonhole principle, f must also be surjective. An injective function from a finite set to itself is necessarily bijective.\n\nStep 4: Because f is surjective, there exists some element x ∈ R such that f(x) = 1. That is, ax = 1. This shows that a has a right inverse x.\n\nStep 5: To show that a actually has a two-sided inverse, we also consider the function g: R → R defined by g(x) = xa for all x ∈ R. We show g is injective similarly: if g(x) = g(y), then xa = ya, so (x - y)a = 0. Since a is not a zero divisor and a ≠ 0, we have x - y = 0, so x = y. Thus g is injective.\n\nStep 6: Since R is finite and g is injective, g is also surjective. Therefore, there exists y ∈ R such that g(y) = 1, i.e., ya = 1. This shows a has a left inverse y.\n\nStep 7: Now we have ax = 1 and ya = 1. We show that x = y:\n   y = y·1 = y(ax) = (ya)x = 1·x = x.\nThus x = y is a two-sided inverse of a.\n\nConclusion: The element a has a multiplicative inverse x ∈ R satisfying ax = xa = 1. In particular, 1 = ax as required.",
