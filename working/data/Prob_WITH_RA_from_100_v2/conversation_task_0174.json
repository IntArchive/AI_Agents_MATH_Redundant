So each S_n has cardinality at most |X|\n6. S is a countable union of sets each of cardinality at most |X|\n7. Therefore |S| ≤ ℵ₀·|X| = |X| (since |X| is infinite)\n8. Also, |S| ≥ |S_1| = |X|\n9.

For each A ∈ S_n, since A has exactly n elements, we can list its elements in some order. Choose any ordering of the elements of A (for instance, by invoking the axiom of choice if needed) to obtain an ordered n-tuple (x₁, x₂, …, xₙ) with {x₁, x₂, …, xₙ} = A.

Our injection simply picks one ordering for each A, which is sufficient to obtain the inequality |S_n| ≤ |X|^n. The stronger statement |S_n| = |X|^n / n! (which holds for infinite X) requires a more delicate counting argument, but the inequality proved here is enough for the required result.\\n\\nThus we have shown that for an infinite set X and any positive integer n, the cardinality of the family of n‑element subsets satisfies |S_n| ≤ n!|X|^n = |X|.\"\n}\n###END_OF_FORMAT###"

        "mathematician and proof writer": "Assumption:\nAssumption 1: X is an infinite set\nAssumption 2: S is the set of all finite subsets of X\nProblem:\nProve that |S_n| ≤ n!|X|^n = |X|\nWe prove the statement in several steps.\n\n1. **Definitions and setup**: Let X be an infinite set. For a fixed positive integer n, define S_n = {A ⊆ X : |A| = n}, the collection of all n-element subsets of X. We work with cardinal numbers, where |Y| denotes the cardinality of a set Y.\n\n2. **Cardinal arithmetic facts**: For an infinite cardinal κ, we have the following standard results in cardinal arithmetic:\n   - κ^n = κ (the product of an infinite cardinal with itself n times equals the cardinal itself).\n   - For any finite positive integer m, m·κ = κ (multiplying an infinite cardinal by a finite positive integer yields the same infinite cardinal).\n   Applying these to κ = |X|, we obtain:\n   - |X|^n = |X|\n   - n!·|X| = |X| (since n! is a finite positive integer).\n   Consequently, n!|X|^n = n!|X| = |X|.\n\n3. **Constructing an injection from S_n to X^n**: Define a map φ: S_n → X^n (where X^n denotes the set of all ordered n-tuples of elements of X) as follows. For each A ∈ S_n, since A has exactly n elements, we can list its elements in some order. Choose any ordering of the elements of A (for instance, by invoking the axiom of choice if needed) to obtain an ordered n-tuple (x₁, x₂, …, xₙ) with {x₁, x₂, …, xₙ} = A. Set φ(A) = (x₁, x₂, …, xₙ).\n   \n   The map φ is injective: if φ(A) = φ(B) for A, B ∈ S_n, then the ordered n-tuples are identical, so the underlying sets of elements are the same; hence A = B.\n\n4. **Cardinality inequality from the injection**: Because φ is an injection, we have |S_n| ≤ |X^n| = |X|^n.\n\n5. **Applying the cardinal arithmetic**: From step 2, |X|^n = |X|. Therefore, |S_n| ≤ |X|.\n\n6. **Combining with the expression involving n!**: From step 2 we also have n!|X|^n = |X|. Hence we can write\n   |S_n| ≤ |X| = n!|X|^n.\n   This is exactly the desired inequality |S_n| ≤ n!|X|^n = |X|.\n\n7. **Remark on the factor n!**: The factor n! appears because each n‑element subset A ∈ S_n can be ordered in n! different ways, giving up to n! distinct ordered n‑tuples in X^n. Our injection simply picks one ordering for each A, which is sufficient to obtain the inequality |S_n| ≤ |X|^n. The stronger statement |S_n| = |X|^n / n! (which holds for infinite X) requires a more delicate counting argument, but the inequality proved here is enough for the required result.\n\nThus we have shown that for an infinite set X and any positive integer n, the cardinality of the family of n‑element subsets satisfies |S_n| ≤ n!|X|^n = |X|.",
