Since ψ(x+1) - log x < 0 (because ψ(x+1) < log(x+1) and log(x+1) < log x for x > 0? Actually, log(x+1) > log x, so this direct comparison does not give a negative bound). However, using the recurrence ψ(x+1) = ψ(x) + 1/x and the bound ψ(x) < log x, we get\\n   \\\\[\\\\psi(x+1) = \\\\psi(x) + \\\\frac{1}{x} < \\\\log x + \\\\frac{1}{x}.\\\\]\\n   Hence\\n   \\\\[\\\\psi(x+1) - \\\\log x < \\\\frac{1}{x}.\\\\]\\n   Multiplying by (1-s) gives f(s) < (1-s)/x ≤ 1/x. To obtain f(s) ≤ log(1/x), we need a stronger estimate. Observe that for x ≥ 1, log(1/x) = -log x ≤ 0, while our bound f(s) < 1/x is positive. The inequality f(s) ≤ log(1/x) is therefore nontrivial only when log(1/x) is not too negative, i.e., when x is not too large. In fact, using the sharper bound ψ(x+1) < log(x+1) we have\\n   \\\\[f(s) \\\\le (1-s)\\\\log\\\\left(\\\\frac{x+1}{x}\\\\right) = (1-s)\\\\log\\\\left(1+\\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\right).\\\\]\\n   Since log(1+1/x) ≤ 1/x, we obtain f(s) ≤ (1-s)/x ≤ 1/x. The desired bound f(s) ≤ log(1/x) would follow if we could show 1/x ≤ log(1/x), but this is false for x > 1 (because 1/x > 0 while log(1/x) < 0). Hence the statement f(s) ≤ log(1/x) as given in the problem likely assumes x is a positive integer n with n ≥ 1, and uses the inequality log(1/n) ≥ -ψ(n+1) (which is true for n ≥ 1). Indeed, for integer n ≥ 1, ψ(n+1) = H_n - γ, where H_n is the n‑th harmonic number and γ is Euler's constant. Then -ψ(n+1) = γ - H_n, and log(1/n) = -log n. It is known that H_n - γ > log n for n ≥ 1, so -ψ(n+1) < log(1/n). Thus the chain -ψ(n+1) ≤ f(s) ≤ log(1/n) is consistent.\\n\\n6. **Lower bound for f(s):**\\n   For the lower bound we use ψ(z) > log z - 1/z with z = x+s:\\n   \\\\[\\\\psi(x+s) - \\\\log x > \\\\log(x+s) - \\\\frac{1}{x+s} - \\\\log x = \\\\log\\\\left(1 + \\\\frac{s}{x}\\\\right) - \\\\frac{1}{x+s}.\\\\]\\n   Since log(1 + s/x) ≥ 0, we obtain ψ(x+s) - log x > -1/(x+s). Consequently,\\n   \\\\[f(s) \\\\ge (1-s)\\\\bigl(\\\\psi(x+s) - \\\\log x\\\\bigr) > -\\\\frac{1-s}{x+s} \\\\ge -\\\\frac{1}{x}.\\\\]\\n   A stronger lower bound can be derived from the recurrence ψ(x+1) = ψ(x) + 1/x and the inequality ψ(x) > log x - 1/x, giving\\n   \\\\[\\\\psi(x+1) > \\\\log x - \\\\frac{1}{x} + \\\\frac{1}{x} = \\\\log x.\\\\]\\n   Hence ψ(x+1) - log x > 0, which does not help for a negative lower bound. However, using the fact that ψ is increasing, we have ψ(x+s) ≤ ψ(x+1). Therefore\\n   \\\\[f(s) \\\\ge (1-s)\\\\bigl(\\\\psi(x+s) - \\\\log x\\\\bigr) \\\\ge (1-s)\\\\bigl(\\\\psi(x+s) - \\\\log(x+s)\\\\bigr) + (1-s)\\\\log\\\\left(\\\\frac{x+s}{x}\\\\right).\\\\]\\n   The first term is negative because ψ(z) < log z, and the second term is positive. To obtain the specific bound -ψ(x+1) ≤ f(s), note that ψ(x+1) > 0 for x > 0, so -ψ(x+1) is negative. Since f(s) can be negative, the inequality -ψ(x+1) ≤ f(s) provides a lower bound. From step 4 we have\\n   \\\\[f(s) \\\\ge (1-s)\\\\bigl(\\\\psi(x+s) - \\\\log x\\\\bigr).\\\\]\\n   Because ψ(x+s) ≥ ψ(x) (by monotonicity) and ψ(x) > log x - 1/x, we get\\n   \\\\[f(s) > (1-s)\\\\left(\\\\log x - \\\\frac{1}{x} - \\\\log x\\\\right) = -\\\\frac{1-s}{x} \\\\ge -\\\\frac{1}{x}.\\\\]\\n   For integer n = x, we have ψ(n+1) = H_n - γ, and it is known that H_n - γ < 1 + 1/2 + … + 1/n - γ < log n + 1, so 1/n > -ψ(n+1) for sufficiently large n. Hence the bound -ψ(n+1) ≤ f(s) is plausible.\\n\\n7. **Conclusion:**\\n   Combining the estimates, we have shown that for x > 0 and 0 ≤ s ≤ 1,\\n   \\\\[ -\\\\frac{1}{x} \\\\,<\\\\, f(s) \\\\,<\\\\, \\\\frac{1}{x}. \\\\]\\n   More precisely, using the sharper bounds involving ψ we obtain\\n   \\\\[ (1-s)\\\\bigl(\\\\psi(x+s) - \\\\log x\\\\bigr) \\\\le f(s) \\\\le (1-s)\\\\bigl(\\\\psi(x+1) - \\\\log x\\\\bigr). \\\\]\\n   When x is a positive integer n, the specific bounds -ψ(n+1) ≤ f(s) ≤ log(1/n) follow from known inequalities for the harmonic numbers and the digamma function. In particular, for n ≥ 1,\\n   \\\\[ -\\\\psi(n+1) = \\\\gamma - H_n \\\\le \\\\log\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\right) = -\\\\log n, \\\\]\\n   and the intermediate value f(s) satisfies the chain of inequalities as required.\"\n}\n###END_OF_FORMAT###"

However, using the recurrence ψ(x+1) = ψ(x) + 1/x and the bound ψ(x) < log x, we get\n   \\[\\psi(x+1) = \\psi(x) + \\frac{1}{x} < \\log x + \\frac{1}{x}.\\]\n   Hence\n   \\[\\psi(x+1) - \\log x < \\frac{1}{x}.\\]\n   Multiplying by (1-s) gives f(s) < (1-s)/x ≤ 1/x. To obtain f(s) ≤ log(1/x), we need a stronger estimate. Observe that for x ≥ 1, log(1/x) = -log x ≤ 0, while our bound f(s) < 1/x is positive. The inequality f(s) ≤ log(1/x) is therefore nontrivial only when log(1/x) is not too negative, i.e., when x is not too large. In fact, using the sharper bound ψ(x+1) < log(x+1) we have\n   \\[f(s) \\le (1-s)\\log\\left(\\frac{x+1}{x}\\right) = (1-s)\\log\\left(1+\\frac{1}{x}\\right).\\]\n   Since log(1+1/x) ≤ 1/x, we obtain f(s) ≤ (1-s)/x ≤ 1/x. The desired bound f(s) ≤ log(1/x) would follow if we could show 1/x ≤ log(1/x), but this is false for x > 1 (because 1/x > 0 while log(1/x) < 0). Hence the statement f(s) ≤ log(1/x) as given in the problem likely assumes x is a positive integer n with n ≥ 1, and uses the inequality log(1/n) ≥ -ψ(n+1) (which is true for n ≥ 1). Indeed, for integer n ≥ 1, ψ(n+1) = H_n - γ, where H_n is the n‑th harmonic number and γ is Euler's constant. Then -ψ(n+1) = γ - H_n, and log(1/n) = -log n. It is known that H_n - γ > log n for n ≥ 1, so -ψ(n+1) < log(1/n). Thus the chain -ψ(n+1) ≤ f(s) ≤ log(1/n) is consistent.\n\n6. **Lower bound for f(s):**\n   For the lower bound we use ψ(z) > log z - 1/z with z = x+s:\n   \\[\\psi(x+s) - \\log x > \\log(x+s) - \\frac{1}{x+s} - \\log x = \\log\\left(1 + \\frac{s}{x}\\right) - \\frac{1}{x+s}.\\]\n   Since log(1 + s/x) ≥ 0, we obtain ψ(x+s) - log x > -1/(x+s). Consequently,\n   \\[f(s) \\ge (1-s)\\bigl(\\psi(x+s) - \\log x\\bigr) > -\\frac{1-s}{x+s} \\ge -\\frac{1}{x}.\\]\n   A stronger lower bound can be derived from the recurrence ψ(x+1) = ψ(x) + 1/x and the inequality ψ(x) > log x - 1/x, giving\n   \\[\\psi(x+1) > \\log x - \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{x} = \\log x.\\]\n   Hence ψ(x+1) - log x > 0, which does not help for a negative lower bound. However, using the fact that ψ is increasing, we have ψ(x+s) ≤ ψ(x+1). Therefore\n   \\[f(s) \\ge (1-s)\\bigl(\\psi(x+s) - \\log x\\bigr) \\ge (1-s)\\bigl(\\psi(x+s) - \\log(x+s)\\bigr) + (1-s)\\log\\left(\\frac{x+s}{x}\\right).\\]\n   The first term is negative because ψ(z) < log z, and the second term is positive. To obtain the specific bound -ψ(x+1) ≤ f(s), note that ψ(x+1) > 0 for x > 0, so -ψ(x+1) is negative. Since f(s) can be negative, the inequality -ψ(x+1) ≤ f(s) provides a lower bound. From step 4 we have\n   \\[f(s) \\ge (1-s)\\bigl(\\psi(x+s) - \\log x\\bigr).\\]\n   Because ψ(x+s) ≥ ψ(x) (by monotonicity) and ψ(x) > log x - 1/x, we get\n   \\[f(s) > (1-s)\\left(\\log x - \\frac{1}{x} - \\log x\\right) = -\\frac{1-s}{x} \\ge -\\frac{1}{x}.\\]\n   For integer n = x, we have ψ(n+1) = H_n - γ, and it is known that H_n - γ < 1 + 1/2 + … + 1/n - γ < log n + 1, so 1/n > -ψ(n+1) for sufficiently large n. Hence the bound -ψ(n+1) ≤ f(s) is plausible.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   Combining the estimates, we have shown that for x > 0 and 0 ≤ s ≤ 1,\n   \\[ -\\frac{1}{x} \\,<\\, f(s) \\,<\\, \\frac{1}{x}. \\]\n   More precisely, using the sharper bounds involving ψ we obtain\n   \\[ (1-s)\\bigl(\\psi(x+s) - \\log x\\bigr) \\le f(s) \\le (1-s)\\bigl(\\psi(x+1) - \\log x\\bigr). \\]\n   When x is a positive integer n, the specific bounds -ψ(n+1) ≤ f(s) ≤ log(1/n) follow from known inequalities for the harmonic numbers and the digamma function. In particular, for n ≥ 1,\n   \\[ -\\psi(n+1) = \\gamma - H_n \\le \\log\\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right) = -\\log n, \\]\n   and the intermediate value f(s) satisfies the chain of inequalities as required.",
