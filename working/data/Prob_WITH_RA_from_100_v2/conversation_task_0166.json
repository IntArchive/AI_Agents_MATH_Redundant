From the assumptions:\n- dim(U) = dim(W) = n (since domain of f and codomain of g have same dimension)\n- dim(V) = m (trivially, codomain of f and domain of g have same dimension)\n\nThus we have:\n- f: U → V where dim(U) = n, dim(V) = m\n- g: V → W where dim(V) = m, dim(W) = n\n\n**Step 2: Choose bases**\nSelect ordered bases for each space:\n- Let {u₁, u₂, ..., uₙ} be a basis for U\n- Let {v₁, v₂, ..., vₘ} be a basis for V  \n- Let {w₁, w₂, ..., wₙ} be a basis for W\n\n**Step 3: Matrix representations**\nRepresent f and g as matrices relative to these bases:\n\nFor f: Since f(u_i) ∈ V for each i = 1,...,n, we can write:\nf(u_i) = Σ_{j=1}^m A_{ji} v_j\nwhere A = (A_{ji}) is an m × n matrix. The entry A_{ji} is the coefficient of v_j in the expansion of f(u_i).\n\nFor g: Since g(v_j) ∈ W for each j = 1,...,m, we can write:\ng(v_j) = Σ_{k=1}^n B_{kj} w_k\nwhere B = (B_{kj}) is an n × m matrix. The entry B_{kj} is the coefficient of w_k in the expansion of g(v_j).\n\n**Step 4: Matrices of compositions**\nNow consider the compositions:\n\n1. f∘g: W → W\n   For any basis vector w_k ∈ W, we have:\n   (f∘g)(w_k) = f(g(w_k))\n   However, note that g maps from V to W, not from W to V. To compute the matrix of f∘g, we need to consider how it acts on basis vectors of W. Since g: V → W, we need to express elements of W in terms of the basis of V to apply f. Alternatively, we can compute the matrix product directly:\n   The matrix representation of f∘g relative to basis {w_k} for both domain and codomain is the n × n matrix BA.\n\n2. g∘f: U → U\n   Similarly, the matrix representation of g∘f relative to basis {u_i} for both domain and codomain is the m × m matrix AB.\n\n**Step 5: Trace computations**\nCompute the traces of these matrix representations:\n\nFor f∘g (matrix BA, size n × n):\ntr(BA) = Σ_{i=1}^n (BA)_{ii} = Σ_{i=1}^n Σ_{j=1}^m B_{ij} A_{ji}\n\nFor g∘f (matrix AB, size m × m):\ntr(AB) = Σ_{j=1}^m (AB)_{jj} = Σ_{j=1}^m Σ_{i=1}^n A_{ji} B_{ij}\n\n**Step 6: Equality of traces**\nObserve that both expressions are finite double sums over the same set of indices i = 1,...,n and j = 1,...,m. They sum the same terms A_{ji} B_{ij}, just in different order:\n\ntr(BA) = Σ_{i=1}^n Σ_{j=1}^m A_{ji} B_{ij}\ntr(AB) = Σ_{j=1}^m Σ_{i=1}^n A_{ji} B_{ij}\n\nSince addition is commutative and associative, and the sums are finite, we can change the order of summation without affecting the result. Therefore:\n\ntr(BA) = tr(AB)\n\n**Step 7: Connection to operator trace**\nThe trace of a linear operator on a finite-dimensional vector space can be computed as the trace of its matrix representation relative to any basis. This is well-defined because:\n1. The characteristic polynomial is basis-independent\n2. The trace appears as the coefficient of t^{n-1} in the characteristic polynomial (up to sign)\n3. Therefore, the trace computed from any matrix representation equals the sum of eigenvalues\n\nThus, we have:\ntr(f∘g) = tr(BA) and tr(g∘f) = tr(AB)\n\n**Step 8: Conclusion**\nCombining the results:\ntr(f∘g) = tr(BA) = tr(AB) = tr(g∘f)\n\nTherefore, tr(f∘g) = tr(g∘f), as required. ∎",
