Prove that $$\\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} (a_n+b_n) \\le \\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} a_n + \\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} b_n$$ I was thinking of using the triangle inequality saying $$|a_n + b_n| \\le |a_n| + |b_n|$$ but the problem is not about absolute values of the sequence. Intuitively it's clear that this is true because $a_n$ and $b_n$ can \"reduce each others magnitude\" if they have opposite signs, but I cannot express that algebraically... Can someone help me out ?",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"Define for all natural numbers $k$: $A_k = \\sup\\{ a_n: n \\ge k \\}$, $B_k = \\sup\\{ b_n: n \\ge k \\}$ (where $A_k, B_k \\in \\mathbb{R} \\cup \\{+\\infty\\}$, (They are decreasing because for larger $k$ we take the $\\sup$ of fewer terms), so that by definition $\\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} a_n = \\lim_{k \\to \\infty} A_k$ and similarly for $B_k$ and $\\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} b_n$.\nAlso we consider the $C_k = \\sup \\{ (a_n + b_n) : n \\ge k \\}$, so that $\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} C_k = \\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} (a_n+b_n)$. Now, fix an index $k$, then for all $n \\ge k$ we have $a_n + b_n \\le A_k + B_k$, because we estimate $a_n$ by the supremum of all terms of $(a_n)$ with $n \\ge k$ and likewise for the $b_n$. As (for fixed $k$) the right hand side is fixed: $$C_k = \\sup \\{ (a_n + b_n : n \\ge k \\} \\le A_k + B_k\\mbox{.}$$ This holds for all $k$, so we take the $\\inf$ or $\\lim$ on both sides as $k$ tends to infinity, and this preserves the inequality and we are done.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants to prove that the lim sup of the sum of two sequences is less than or equal to the sum of their lim sups. Hmm, I remember that lim sup is the supremum of all the accumulation points of a sequence. So, for each sequence a_n and b_n, their lim sups are the largest limit points of their respective sequences.\n\nBut how does the lim sup of the sum relate to the individual lim sups? The user mentioned using the triangle inequality, but that's for absolute values. The problem here isn't about absolute values, so maybe that approach isn't directly applicable. Wait, but maybe there's a similar inequality for lim sups. Let me recall the properties of lim sup.\n\nI remember that one of the key properties is that lim sup (a_n + b_n) ≤ lim sup a_n + lim sup b_n, provided that the lim sups on the right are not indeterminate forms like ∞ - ∞. But here, the problem is to prove exactly that inequality, so we can't just cite it as a property; we need to prove it.\n\nLet me think about the definitions. The lim sup of a sequence c_n is defined as the infimum over all n of the supremum of c_k for k ≥ n. So, lim sup c_n = inf_n sup_{k ≥ n} c_k. Alternatively, it's the largest subsequential limit of c_n.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about lim sup is that for any ε > 0, there exists an N such that for all n ≥ N, a_n ≤ lim sup a_n + ε, and similarly for b_n. Then, adding these inequalities would give a_n + b_n ≤ lim sup a_n + lim sup b_n + 2ε. Taking lim sup on both sides, we get lim sup (a_n + b_n) ≤ lim sup a_n + lim sup b_n + 2ε. Since ε is arbitrary, this would imply the desired inequality.\n\nWait, that seems like a standard approach. Let me check if that makes sense. Suppose we take ε > 0. Then, there exists N such that for all n ≥ N, a_n ≤ lim sup a_n + ε. Similarly, there exists M such that for all n ≥ M, b_n ≤ lim sup b_n + ε. Then, taking K = max(N, M), for all n ≥ K, a_n + b_n ≤ (lim sup a_n + ε) + (lim sup b_n + ε) = lim sup a_n + lim sup b_n + 2ε. Now, taking the supremum of a_n + b_n for n ≥ K, we have sup_{n ≥ K} (a_n + b_n) ≤ lim sup a_n + lim sup b_n + 2ε. Then, taking the infimum over K on the left side (which corresponds to taking lim sup), we get lim sup (a_n + b_n) ≤ lim sup a_n + lim sup b_n + 2ε. Since ε is arbitrary, we can let ε approach 0, which gives the desired inequality.\n\nThat seems to work. But wait, does this approach require that the lim sups of a_n and b_n are finite? If either of them is infinite, we need to handle those cases separately. For example, if lim sup a_n is infinity, then the right-hand side is infinity, and the inequality holds trivially. Similarly, if lim sup b_n is negative infinity, but I think the problem assumes that the sequences are such that the right-hand side is defined (i.e., not indeterminate like ∞ - ∞).\n\nSo, the key assumptions here are that a_n and b_n are real sequences, and the sum of their lim sups is defined. So, maybe the problem implicitly assumes that both lim sups are not infinity of opposite signs, which would make the sum undefined. But since the problem statement doesn't mention any restrictions, perhaps we need to include that in the assumptions.\n\nWait, looking back at the original problem statement: The user wrote \"Prove that $$\\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} (a_n+b_n) \\le \\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} a_n + \\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} b_n$$\". There's no mention of conditions on a_n and b_n. But in real analysis, this inequality holds provided that the right-hand side is not an indeterminate form. So, we need to assume that the lim sups of a_n and b_n are not such that their sum is indeterminate. That is, we cannot have one being +infty and the other -infty. But in standard analysis, the lim sup is always either a real number or ±infty. So, the inequality holds as long as the right-hand side is defined. Therefore, the assumptions should include that the sum of the lim sups is defined.\n\nBut the problem statement on Math Stack Exchange didn't specify any conditions. However, when structuring the problem, we need to list the assumptions. So, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- a_n is a real sequence.\n- b_n is a real sequence.\n- The lim sup of a_n exists (possibly infinite).\n- The lim sup of b_n exists (possibly infinite).\n- The sum of the lim sups of a_n and b_n is defined (i.e., not ∞ - ∞).\n\nBut in the original problem, the user didn't mention these, so maybe the default assumptions are that a_n and b_n are real sequences, and their lim sups are in the extended real numbers, with the sum being defined. However, when structuring the problem, perhaps we need to make explicit the necessary assumptions. But in the example given by the user, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, which the user listed as two separate assumptions. So, in this case, the problem is to prove the inequality for real sequences a_n and b_n, assuming that the right-hand side is defined.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the context of real sequences where the lim sups are finite. But the problem statement as given doesn't specify. However, the standard result is that if the sum on the right is defined (i.e., not ∞ - ∞), then the inequality holds. So, perhaps the assumptions are that a_n and b_n are real sequences, and the right-hand side is not an indeterminate form. However, the problem as stated by the user doesn't include those, so perhaps the user is assuming that the sequences are such that the lim sups are finite. But since the problem is from Math Stack Exchange, and the user didn't specify, maybe we need to structure the problem with the minimal assumptions required for the inequality to hold.\n\nSo, the necessary assumptions are:\n\n- a_n is a real sequence.\n- b_n is a real sequence.\n- The sum of the lim sup of a_n and lim sup of b_n is defined in the extended real numbers.\n\nBut since in the problem statement, the user is trying to prove the inequality, which is a standard result in analysis under the condition that the sum on the right is defined. Therefore, the formatted problem should list the necessary assumptions. However, in the example provided by the user, the assumptions were specific conditions on n. In this case, the problem is general for any real sequences a_n and b_n, provided that the sum of their lim sups is defined.\n\nBut how to phrase the assumptions? Each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\na_n is a real sequence,\nb_n is a real sequence,\nlim sup_{n→∞} a_n exists in the extended real numbers,\nlim sup_{n→∞} b_n exists in the extended real numbers,\nthe sum of lim sup a_n and lim sup b_n is defined.\n\nBut maybe that's too verbose. Alternatively, the problem might implicitly assume that a_n and b_n are real sequences, and their lim sups are in the extended real numbers with the sum defined. However, since the problem is to prove the inequality, perhaps the only necessary assumptions are that a_n and b_n are real sequences. Because even if their lim sups are infinite, the inequality still holds as long as the sum is defined. But the user's original problem didn't specify any restrictions, so perhaps the assumptions are simply:\n\n- a_n is a real sequence,\n- b_n is a real sequence.\n\nBecause the problem is about real sequences, and the lim sup is defined for real sequences. The case where the sum is undefined (like ∞ - ∞) might be excluded by convention, but since the problem statement doesn't mention it, perhaps we don't need to include it. Alternatively, the problem might be in the context where lim sups are finite, but the user didn't specify. But the standard theorem doesn't require finiteness; it holds in the extended reals as long as the sum is defined.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct assumptions are:\n\n- a_n is a real sequence,\n- b_n is a real sequence,\n- lim sup_{n→∞} a_n and lim sup_{n→∞} b_n are not both infinite with opposite signs.\n\nBut the problem is how to phrase that concisely. However, in the example given by the user, the assumptions were simply that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. The user didn't include the implicit assumption that 5^n etc., are defined. So, perhaps here, the only necessary explicit assumptions are that a_n and b_n are real sequences. The rest is part of the problem's context.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is stated as is, without any extra conditions, perhaps the formatted problem should list the assumptions as:\n\nAssumption:\na_n is a real sequence,\nb_n is a real sequence.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} (a_n+b_n) \\le \\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} a_n + \\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} b_n$$\n\nBut in the standard theorem, the inequality holds provided that the right-hand side is defined. So, if one lim sup is +infty and the other is -infty, the inequality is meaningless. Therefore, the assumption should also include that such a case does not occur. So, maybe:\n\nAssumption:\na_n is a real sequence,\nb_n is a real sequence,\nthe sum of lim sup_{n→∞} a_n and lim sup_{n→∞} b_n is defined.\n\nBut how to phrase \"defined\" in terms of individual properties? Perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\na_n is a real sequence,\nb_n is a real sequence,\nlim sup_{n→∞} a_n is not +∞ if lim sup_{n→∞} b_n is -∞,\nlim sup_{n→∞} a_n is not -∞ if lim sup_{n→∞} b_n is +∞.\n\nBut that's getting too detailed. Alternatively, in the original problem, the user didn't specify any restrictions, so perhaps the answer should structure the problem with the minimal assumptions, i.e., that a_n and b_n are real sequences, and the problem is to prove the inequality under the condition that the right-hand side is defined. However, the user's example included specific conditions (like n divisible by 7), but here, the conditions are more about the sequences being real and the lim sups not leading to an indeterminate form.\n\nBut maybe the problem is intended to be in the context where the lim sups are finite. If that's the case, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\na_n is a real sequence with finite lim sup,\nb_n is a real sequence with finite lim sup.\n\nBut the original problem statement didn't specify that, so perhaps we should follow the example and list the assumptions as:\n\nAssumption:\na_n is a real sequence,\nb_n is a real sequence.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} (a_n+b_n) \\le \\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} a_n + \\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} b_n$$\n\nBut given the standard theorem's conditions, perhaps the assumption should include that the sum is defined. But since the problem is presented as is, perhaps we don't need to add that. The example given by the user included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\"). Wait, actually, in the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem changed it to assume n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, the original problem was:\n\nOriginal problem:\nProve that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nassumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nproblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that's strange. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Because 91 is 7*13, so perhaps the original problem was to show divisibility by 91 for every integer n, which might require that n is such that 5^n and 6^n have certain properties modulo 7 and 13. But the formatted problem added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7, which might not be in the original problem. That example might be incorrect. So perhaps the user made a mistake in their example.\n\nGiven that, maybe the correct approach is to list the assumptions as they are in the problem, but in the example, the user added an assumption that wasn't there. Therefore, perhaps in this current problem, we should not add any assumptions beyond what is in the problem statement. The problem statement says \"Prove that lim sup (a_n + b_n) ≤ lim sup a_n + lim sup b_n\". The user didn't specify any conditions, so the assumptions are just that a_n and b_n are real sequences. Therefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\na_n is a real sequence,\nb_n is a real sequence.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} (a_n+b_n) \\le \\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} a_n + \\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} b_n$$\n\nHowever, the standard theorem does require that the sum of the lim sups is defined, i.e., not ∞ - ∞. But since the problem is stated as is, perhaps the user expects that the problem is under the general conditions where the inequality makes sense. Therefore, the necessary assumptions are that a_n and b_n are real sequences, and the sum of their lim sups is defined. But how to express that in separate lines?\n\nIf we follow the example's structure, even if the original problem had \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem added specific assumptions. But in the current problem, the original problem didn't have any restrictions, so maybe the formatted problem should only include the necessary assumptions for the inequality to hold, which are:\n\n- a_n is a real sequence,\n- b_n is a real sequence,\n- lim sup_{n→∞} a_n and lim sup_{n→∞} b_n are not infinities of opposite signs.\n\nBut expressing the last part as separate assumptions might be tricky. Alternatively, since the problem is posed as is, maybe the answer should only include that a_n and b_n are real sequences, as the other conditions are part of the problem's context.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct formatted problem is:\n\nAssumption:\na_n is a real sequence,\nb_n is a real sequence.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} (a_n+b_n) \\le \\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} a_n + \\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} b_n$$\n\nBecause even though there's a caveat about the sum being defined, the problem as stated doesn't mention it, so it's assumed that the context is where the sum is defined. Therefore, the answer should follow this structure.",
