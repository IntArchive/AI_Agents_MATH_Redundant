To show linear independence, suppose $a + b\\sqrt{p_1} = 0$ with $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. If $b \\neq 0$, then $\\sqrt{p_1} = -a/b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, contradicting that $\\sqrt{p_1}$ is irrational (since $p_1$ is prime). Thus $b=0$, and then $a=0$. So $B_1$ is linearly independent over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Induction hypothesis:** Assume for $n-1$ that $B_{n-1}$ has $2^{n-1}$ elements and is linearly independent over $\\mathbb{Q}$, and that $[\\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{p_1}, \\dots, \\sqrt{p_{n-1}}] : \\mathbb{Q}] = 2^{n-1}$.\n\n**Induction step:** Consider $B_n$. By definition, each element is of the form $\\alpha \\cdot \\sqrt{p_n}^{\\epsilon_n}$ where $\\alpha \\in B_{n-1}$ and $\\epsilon_n \\in \\{0,1\\}$. Thus $|B_n| = 2 \\cdot |B_{n-1}| = 2 \\cdot 2^{n-1} = 2^n$.\n\nNow we show linear independence. Suppose we have a linear relation:\n$$\\sum_{\\epsilon \\in \\{0,1\\}^n} c_\\epsilon \\sqrt{p_1}^{\\epsilon_1} \\cdots \\sqrt{p_n}^{\\epsilon_n} = 0$$\nwith $c_\\epsilon \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nGroup terms by whether $\\epsilon_n = 0$ or $1$:\n$$\\sum_{\\epsilon' \\in \\{0,1\\}^{n-1}} c_{(\\epsilon',0)} \\sqrt{p_1}^{\\epsilon_1'} \\cdots \\sqrt{p_{n-1}}^{\\epsilon_{n-1}'} + \\sqrt{p_n} \\sum_{\\epsilon' \\in \\{0,1\\}^{n-1}} c_{(\\epsilon',1)} \\sqrt{p_1}^{\\epsilon_1'} \\cdots \\sqrt{p_{n-1}}^{\\epsilon_{n-1}'} = 0$$\n\nLet $A = \\sum_{\\epsilon'} c_{(\\epsilon',0)} \\sqrt{p_1}^{\\epsilon_1'} \\cdots \\sqrt{p_{n-1}}^{\\epsilon_{n-1}'}$ and $B = \\sum_{\\epsilon'} c_{(\\epsilon',1)} \\sqrt{p_1}^{\\epsilon_1'} \\cdots \\sqrt{p_{n-1}}^{\\epsilon_{n-1}'}$, both in $\\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{p_1}, \\dots, \\sqrt{p_{n-1}}]$.\n\nThen $A + \\sqrt{p_n} B = 0$.\n\n**Claim:** $\\sqrt{p_n} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{p_1}, \\dots, \\sqrt{p_{n-1}}]$.\n\n*Proof of claim:* Suppose $\\sqrt{p_n} \\in \\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{p_1}, \\dots, \\sqrt{p_{n-1}}]$. Then there exists a polynomial $f(x) \\in \\mathbb{Q}[x]$ such that $f(\\sqrt{p_n}) = 0$. The minimal polynomial of $\\sqrt{p_n}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $x^2 - p_n$, which must divide $f(x)$. But $x^2 - p_n$ remains irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{p_1}, \\dots, \\sqrt{p_{n-1}}]$ because if it factored, then $\\sqrt{p_n}$ would be in this field, implying that $p_n$ is a product of squares of elements in $\\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{p_1}, \\dots, \\sqrt{p_{n-1}}]$, which would force relationships among the primes contradicting their distinctness. More formally, one can use that the degree $[\\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{p_1}, \\dots, \\sqrt{p_{n-1}}, \\sqrt{p_n}] : \\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{p_1}, \\dots, \\sqrt{p_{n-1}}]]$ is either 1 or 2, and it must be 2 by considering automorphisms or norms.\n\nThus $\\sqrt{p_n}$ is quadratic over $\\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{p_1}, \\dots, \\sqrt{p_{n-1}}]$, so $1$ and $\\sqrt{p_n}$ are linearly independent over $\\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{p_1}, \\dots, \\sqrt{p_{n-1}}]$.\n\nReturning to $A + \\sqrt{p_n} B = 0$, since $1$ and $\\sqrt{p_n}$ are linearly independent over $\\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{p_1}, \\dots, \\sqrt{p_{n-1}}]$, we must have $A = 0$ and $B = 0$.\n\nBy the induction hypothesis, $B_{n-1}$ is linearly independent over $\\mathbb{Q}$, so from $A = 0$ we get $c_{(\\epsilon',0)} = 0$ for all $\\epsilon'$, and from $B = 0$ we get $c_{(\\epsilon',1)} = 0$ for all $\\epsilon'$.\n\nThus all coefficients $c_\\epsilon = 0$, proving $B_n$ is linearly independent over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nFinally, since $B_n$ is a linearly independent set of size $2^n$ in $\\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{p_1}, \\dots, \\sqrt{p_n}]$, and it clearly spans this field (as any product of square roots can be reduced to an element of $B_n$), it is a basis.

Thus the degrees would be $2^{n-1} = 2^n$, contradiction.

To show linear independence, suppose $a + b\\sqrt{p_1} = 0$ with $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. If $b \\neq 0$, then $\\sqrt{p_1} = -a/b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, contradicting that $\\sqrt{p_1}$ is irrational (since $p_1$ is prime). Thus $b=0$, and then $a=0$. So $B_1$ is linearly independent over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Induction hypothesis:** Assume for $n-1$ that $B_{n-1}$ has $2^{n-1}$ elements and is linearly independent over $\\mathbb{Q}$, and that $[\\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{p_1}, \\dots, \\sqrt{p_{n-1}}] : \\mathbb{Q}] = 2^{n-1}$.\n\n**Induction step:** Consider $B_n$. By definition, each element is of the form $\\alpha \\cdot \\sqrt{p_n}^{\\epsilon_n}$ where $\\alpha \\in B_{n-1}$ and $\\epsilon_n \\in \\{0,1\\}$. Thus $|B_n| = 2 \\cdot |B_{n-1}| = 2 \\cdot 2^{n-1} = 2^n$.\n\nNow we show linear independence. Suppose we have a linear relation:\n$$\\sum_{\\epsilon \\in \\{0,1\\}^n} c_\\epsilon \\sqrt{p_1}^{\\epsilon_1} \\cdots \\sqrt{p_n}^{\\epsilon_n} = 0$$\nwith $c_\\epsilon \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nGroup terms by whether $\\epsilon_n = 0$ or $1$:\n$$\\sum_{\\epsilon' \\in \\{0,1\\}^{n-1}} c_{(\\epsilon',0)} \\sqrt{p_1}^{\\epsilon_1'} \\cdots \\sqrt{p_{n-1}}^{\\epsilon_{n-1}'} + \\sqrt{p_n} \\sum_{\\epsilon' \\in \\{0,1\\}^{n-1}} c_{(\\epsilon',1)} \\sqrt{p_1}^{\\epsilon_1'} \\cdots \\sqrt{p_{n-1}}^{\\epsilon_{n-1}'} = 0$$\n\nLet $A = \\sum_{\\epsilon'} c_{(\\epsilon',0)} \\sqrt{p_1}^{\\epsilon_1'} \\cdots \\sqrt{p_{n-1}}^{\\epsilon_{n-1}'}$ and $B = \\sum_{\\epsilon'} c_{(\\epsilon',1)} \\sqrt{p_1}^{\\epsilon_1'} \\cdots \\sqrt{p_{n-1}}^{\\epsilon_{n-1}'}$, both in $\\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{p_1}, \\dots, \\sqrt{p_{n-1}}]$.\n\nThen $A + \\sqrt{p_n} B = 0$.\n\n**Claim:** $\\sqrt{p_n} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{p_1}, \\dots, \\sqrt{p_{n-1}}]$.\n\n*Proof of claim:* Suppose $\\sqrt{p_n} \\in \\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{p_1}, \\dots, \\sqrt{p_{n-1}}]$. Then there exists a polynomial $f(x) \\in \\mathbb{Q}[x]$ such that $f(\\sqrt{p_n}) = 0$. The minimal polynomial of $\\sqrt{p_n}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $x^2 - p_n$, which must divide $f(x)$. But $x^2 - p_n$ remains irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{p_1}, \\dots, \\sqrt{p_{n-1}}]$ because if it factored, then $\\sqrt{p_n}$ would be in this field, implying that $p_n$ is a product of squares of elements in $\\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{p_1}, \\dots, \\sqrt{p_{n-1}}]$, which would force relationships among the primes contradicting their distinctness. More formally, one can use that the degree $[\\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{p_1}, \\dots, \\sqrt{p_{n-1}}, \\sqrt{p_n}] : \\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{p_1}, \\dots, \\sqrt{p_{n-1}}]]$ is either 1 or 2, and it must be 2 by considering automorphisms or norms.\n\nThus $\\sqrt{p_n}$ is quadratic over $\\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{p_1}, \\dots, \\sqrt{p_{n-1}}]$, so $1$ and $\\sqrt{p_n}$ are linearly independent over $\\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{p_1}, \\dots, \\sqrt{p_{n-1}}]$.\n\nReturning to $A + \\sqrt{p_n} B = 0$, since $1$ and $\\sqrt{p_n}$ are linearly independent over $\\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{p_1}, \\dots, \\sqrt{p_{n-1}}]$, we must have $A = 0$ and $B = 0$.\n\nBy the induction hypothesis, $B_{n-1}$ is linearly independent over $\\mathbb{Q}$, so from $A = 0$ we get $c_{(\\epsilon',0)} = 0$ for all $\\epsilon'$, and from $B = 0$ we get $c_{(\\epsilon',1)} = 0$ for all $\\epsilon'$.\n\nThus all coefficients $c_\\epsilon = 0$, proving $B_n$ is linearly independent over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nFinally, since $B_n$ is a linearly independent set of size $2^n$ in $\\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{p_1}, \\dots, \\sqrt{p_n}]$, and it clearly spans this field (as any product of square roots can be reduced to an element of $B_n$), it is a basis.
