    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants me to structure the problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The original problem is to prove that the integral from 0 to infinity of [sin(2013x)\/(x(cos x + cosh x))] dx equals π\/4. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The example given had assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the integral is from 0 to infinity, so the function is integrated over the positive real line. The integrand is sin(2013x) divided by x times (cos x + cosh x). \n\nAssumptions would include the limits of integration (0 to ∞), the integrand's components: sin(2013x), the denominator x(cos x + cosh x), and perhaps the existence of the integral (i.e., it converges). But according to the example, each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. \n\nSo breaking it down:\n\n1. The integral is taken from 0 to infinity.\n2. The integrand involves sin(2013x) in the numerator.\n3. The denominator is x multiplied by (cos x + cosh x).\n4. The integral is well-defined (convergent), but maybe that's implicit. The problem might not state this, but perhaps the user expects it to be an assumption. Wait, the example didn't include convergence as an assumption; the original problem just stated the integral. So maybe the assumptions here are the structure of the integrand and the limits. The problem is to compute the integral and show it's π\/4 regardless of 2013, but the coefficient 2013 is part of the sine function. However, the example's assumption included specific conditions on variables. Here, 2013 is a constant, but perhaps the problem holds for any integer or specific value. Wait, the original problem title mentions 2013, but maybe the year is just part of the problem's context. The key is that the integral has sin(2013x), and the answer is π\/4 regardless of 2013? Wait, but the answer is π\/4. Maybe the coefficient in the sine function doesn't affect the result, which is interesting. So perhaps the assumption is that 2013 is a positive real number, but given that it's 2013, maybe it's an integer. But the problem as stated doesn't specify any conditions on 2013, so perhaps the only assumptions are the form of the integrand and the limits. \n\nSo the problem's assumptions would be:\n\n- The integral is over the interval [0, ∞).\n- The integrand is sin(2013x)\/(x(cos x + cosh x)).\n\nBut the example included conditions on variables. Here, 2013 is a constant, so maybe it's not an assumption but part of the problem statement. The example's assumption listed that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, maybe there are no variables but the integral's structure. So perhaps the assumptions are just the integral's components. Wait, but the problem is to prove the integral equals π\/4. The original example had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, but the problem had to prove divisibility by 91. So in that case, the assumptions were about n. Here, maybe the assumptions are about the integrand's properties. But perhaps in this case, there are no explicit assumptions beyond the integral's form. Wait, the problem statement is just to compute the integral. So maybe the assumptions are the structure of the integral. Wait, but according to the example, assumptions are listed as conditions. So perhaps here, the integral is from 0 to infinity, and the integrand is as given. So each part would be an assumption. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is over the interval from 0 to ∞,\nThe integrand is sin(2013x) divided by x(cos x + cosh x).\n\nBut the example had two assumptions, even though the original problem didn't state them explicitly. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem added an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, no, the example's formatted problem actually changed the original problem. Wait, the original problem was \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem changed it to \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". So that's modifying the original problem. Wait, maybe the user's example is incorrect? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which changes the problem. That seems like a mistake. But perhaps the user intended to have the formatted problem include the conditions from the original problem. Wait, maybe the original problem had a typo, but the example was structured to list assumptions. So perhaps the task is to extract the conditions from the problem statement. \n\nBut in the current problem, the integral is given as is. There are no stated conditions, but perhaps the assumptions are the form of the integral. However, in the example, even though the original problem didn't state n is divisible by 7, the formatted problem added it as an assumption, which seems incorrect. Wait, that's confusing. Maybe the example is wrong. Wait, the original example's problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, the assumptions are \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" So they added an extra condition, which changes the problem. That seems like an error. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. Therefore, maybe the correct approach is to list the assumptions as given in the problem, without adding new ones. \n\nBut given that the user provided that example, even if it's incorrect, I have to follow their format. So for the integral problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The integral is from 0 to infinity.\n- The integrand is sin(2013x)\/(x(cos x + cosh x)).\n\nBut the example included specific conditions on variables. Here, since the integral has no variables except for x (the variable of integration), and 2013 is a constant. So maybe the assumptions are just the integral setup. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is over the interval [0, ∞),\nThe integrand is sin(2013x)\/(x(cos x + cosh x)).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the integral equals π\/4.\n\nBut perhaps the user's example shows that even if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So in this case, the original problem is to prove the integral equals π\/4, so the assumptions would be the integral's structure. So following that, the answer would be as above.",

Consequently, any proof attempting to establish this equality must contain a flaw. The correct value of the integral is not $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$. We will derive the correct value for the integral, which depends on the parameter $a=2013$.\n\n### Correct Evaluation of the Integral\n\nLet the integral be denoted by $I(a)$, where $a=2013$:\n$$ I(a) = \\int_0^\\infty\\frac{\\sin(ax)}{x(\\cos(x)+\\cosh(x))}\\mathrm{d}x $$\n\nWe can evaluate this integral using Plancherel's theorem for Fourier transforms. The theorem states that for two functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ with Fourier transforms $F(k)$ and $G(k)$, the following identity holds:\n$$ \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x) g^*(x) dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty F(k) G^*(k) dk $$\nWe use the unitary convention for the Fourier transform: $F(k) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x) e^{-ikx} dx$.\n\n1.  **Define the functions:**\n    Let $f(x) = \\frac{\\sin(ax)}{x}$ and $g(x) = \\frac{1}{\\cos(x)+\\cosh(x)}$. Both functions are real and even. The integral can be written as:\n    $$ I(a) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x) g(x) dx $$\n\n2.  **Compute the Fourier transform of f(x):**\n    The Fourier transform of $f(x) = \\frac{\\sin(ax)}{x}$ is a rectangular function:\n    $$ F(k) = \\mathcal{F}\\left\\{\\frac{\\sin(ax)}{x}\\right\\}(k) = \\begin{cases} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} & \\text{if } |k| < a \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } |k| > a \\end{cases} $$\n\n3.  **Compute the Fourier transform of g(x):**\n    The Fourier transform of $g(x) = \\frac{1}{\\cos(x)+\\cosh(x)}$ is given by:\n    $$ G(k) = \\mathcal{F}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{\\cos x + \\cosh x}\\right\\}(k) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{e^{-ikx}}{\\cos x + \\cosh x} dx $$\n    Since $g(x)$ is even, this simplifies to a cosine transform:\n    $$ G(k) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi}} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\cos(kx)}{\\cos x + \\cosh x} dx $$\n    A known integral identity is $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\cos(kx)}{\\cos x + \\cosh x} dx = \\frac{\\pi}{2\\cosh(k\\pi\/2)}$.\n    Substituting this result, we get:\n    $$ G(k) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi}} \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{2\\cosh(k\\pi\/2)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\text{sech}\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{2}\\right) $$\n\n4.  **Apply Plancherel's Theorem:**\n    $$ \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x) g(x) dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty F(k) G(k) dk $$\n    $$ 2I(a) = \\int_{-a}^a \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\text{sech}\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{2}\\right)\\right) dk $$\n    $$ 2I(a) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\int_{-a}^a \\text{sech}\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{2}\\right) dk $$\n    Since the integrand is an even function, we can write:\n    $$ 2I(a) = 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\int_0^a \\text{sech}\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{2}\\right) dk = \\pi \\int_0^a \\text{sech}\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{2}\\right) dk $$\n\n5.  **Evaluate the final integral:**\n    The antiderivative of $\\text{sech}(u)$ is $\\arctan(\\sinh(u))$.\n    $$ \\int_0^a \\text{sech}\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{2}\\right) dk = \\left[\\frac{2}{\\pi}\\arctan\\left(\\sinh\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{2}\\right)\\right)\\right]_0^a $$\n    $$ = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\left[\\arctan\\left(\\sinh\\left(\\frac{a\\pi}{2}\\right)\\right) - \\arctan(\\sinh(0))\\right] = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\arctan\\left(\\sinh\\left(\\frac{a\\pi}{2}\\right)\\right) $$\n    Substituting this back into the equation for $I(a)$:\n    $$ 2I(a) = \\pi \\cdot \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\arctan\\left(\\sinh\\left(\\frac{a\\pi}{2}\\right)\\right) $$\n    $$ I(a) = \\arctan\\left(\\sinh\\left(\\frac{a\\pi}{2}\\right)\\right) $$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct value of the integral is $I(a) = \\arctan(\\sinh(a\\pi\/2))$. For the given problem, $a = 2013$.\n$$ \\int_0^\\infty\\frac{\\sin(2013x)}{x(\\cos(x)+\\cosh(x))}\\mathrm{d}x = \\arctan\\left(\\sinh\\left(\\frac{2013\\pi}{2}\\right)\\right) $$\nFor the proposition to be true, we would need $\\arctan(\\sinh(2013\\pi\/2)) = \\pi\/4$, which implies $\\sinh(2013\\pi\/2) = \\tan(\\pi\/4) = 1$.\nHowever, $\\sinh(x)=1$ only for $x = \\text{arsinh}(1) = \\ln(1+\\sqrt{2}) \\approx 0.8814$.\nThe value in our integral is $x = \\frac{2013\\pi}{2} \\approx 3162.1$, which is vastly different. In fact, for such a large argument, $\\sinh(2013\\pi\/2)$ is an extremely large number, and the arctan of this number is very close to $\\pi\/2$.\n\nTherefore, the original proposition is false.",
