Since $\\\\sqrt{-19}$ is algebraic over $\\\\mathbb{Q}$ with minimal polynomial $x^2 + 19$, the field $K$ is a quadratic extension of $\\\\mathbb{Q}$. In particular, $[K:\\\\mathbb{Q}] = 2$, so $K$ is a finite extension of $\\\\mathbb{Q}$.\\n\\n**Step 2: Show $R \\\\subseteq \\\\mathcal{O}_K$**\\nLet $\\\\alpha \\\\in R$. Then $\\\\alpha$ can be written as $\\\\alpha = a + b\\\\cdot\\\\frac{1+\\\\sqrt{-19}}{2}$ for some $a, b \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}$. We compute the minimal polynomial of $\\\\alpha$ over $\\\\mathbb{Q}$:\\n\\nLet $\\\\alpha = a + b\\\\cdot\\\\frac{1+\\\\sqrt{-19}}{2} = \\\\left(a + \\\\frac{b}{2}\\\\right) + \\\\frac{b}{2}\\\\sqrt{-19}$.\\nDefine $m = a + \\\\frac{b}{2}$ and $n = \\\\frac{b}{2}$, so $\\\\alpha = m + n\\\\sqrt{-19}$ with $m, n \\\\in \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\mathbb{Z}$.\\n\\nThe minimal polynomial of $\\\\alpha$ is:\\n\\\\begin{align*}\\n(x - \\\\alpha)(x - \\\\overline{\\\\alpha}) &= \\\\left(x - (m + n\\\\sqrt{-19})\\\\right)\\\\left(x - (m - n\\\\sqrt{-19})\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\n&= x^2 - 2mx + (m^2 + 19n^2).\\n\\\\end{align*}\\n\\nSince $m = a + \\\\frac{b}{2}$ and $n = \\\\frac{b}{2}$, we have:\\n\\\\begin{align*}\\nm^2 + 19n^2 &= \\\\left(a + \\\\frac{b}{2}\\\\right)^2 + 19\\\\left(\\\\frac{b}{2}\\\\right)^2 \\\\\\\\\\n&= a^2 + ab + \\\\frac{b^2}{4} + \\\\frac{19b^2}{4} \\\\\\\\\\n&= a^2 + ab + \\\\frac{20b^2}{4} \\\\\\\\\\n&= a^2 + ab + 5b^2.\\n\\\\end{align*}\\n\\nThus the minimal polynomial is $x^2 - (2a + b)x + (a^2 + ab + 5b^2)$. Since $a, b \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}$, the coefficients $-(2a+b)$ and $a^2 + ab + 5b^2$ are integers. Moreover, the polynomial is monic. Therefore, $\\\\alpha$ is an algebraic integer, so $\\\\alpha \\\\in \\\\mathcal{O}_K$. This shows $R \\\\subseteq \\\\mathcal{O}_K$.\\n\\n**Step 3: Apply the general structure theorem for quadratic fields**\\nFor a quadratic field $\\\\mathbb{Q}(\\\\sqrt{d})$ where $d$ is a squarefree integer, the ring of integers $\\\\mathcal{O}_{\\\\mathbb{Q}(\\\\sqrt{d})}$ is given by:\\n\\\\begin{itemize}\\n\\\\item $\\\\mathbb{Z}\\\\left[\\\\frac{1+\\\\sqrt{d}}{2}\\\\right]$ if $d \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{4}$\\n\\\\item $\\\\mathbb{Z}[\\\\sqrt{d}]$ if $d \\\\equiv 2, 3 \\\\pmod{4}$\\n\\\\end{itemize}\\n\\n**Step 4: Check the congruence condition**\\nWe have $d = -19$. Computing modulo 4:\\n\\\\[-19 = -20 + 1 \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{4}.\\\\]\\nThus $d \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{4}$.\\n\\n**Step 5: Conclude the ring of integers**\\nBy the structure theorem, since $d = -19 \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{4}$, the ring of integers of $K = \\\\mathbb{Q}(\\\\sqrt{-19})$ is:\\n\\\\[\\\\mathcal{O}_K = \\\\mathbb{Z}\\\\left[\\\\frac{1+\\\\sqrt{-19}}{2}\\\\right] = R.\\\\]\\n\\n**Step 6: Alternative direct verification (optional)**\\nTo verify directly that $R$ contains all algebraic integers in $K$, let $\\\\beta \\\\in \\\\mathcal{O}_K$. Since $K = \\\\mathbb{Q}(\\\\sqrt{-19})$, we can write $\\\\beta = \\\\frac{u + v\\\\sqrt{-19}}{2}$ for some $u, v \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Q}$. The minimal polynomial of $\\\\beta$ is $x^2 - ux + \\\\frac{u^2 + 19v^2}{4}$. For $\\\\beta$ to be an algebraic integer, we need $u \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\\\frac{u^2 + 19v^2}{4} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}$. This implies $u^2 + 19v^2 \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{4}$.\\n\\nSince $u \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}$, $u^2 \\\\equiv 0$ or $1 \\\\pmod{4}$. For $u^2 + 19v^2 \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{4}$, and noting that $19 \\\\equiv 3 \\\\pmod{4}$, we have:\\n- If $u$ is even, then $u^2 \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{4}$, so $19v^2 \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{4}$, which implies $v^2 \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{4}$, so $v$ is even.\\n- If $u$ is odd, then $u^2 \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{4}$, so $19v^2 \\\\equiv 3v^2 \\\\equiv 3 \\\\pmod{4}$, which implies $v^2 \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{4}$, so $v$ is odd.\\n\\nThus $u$ and $v$ have the same parity. Writing $u = a+b$ and $v = b$ for some $a, b \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}$, we get:\\n\\\\[\\\\beta = \\\\frac{(a+b) + b\\\\sqrt{-19}}{2} = a + b\\\\cdot\\\\frac{1+\\\\sqrt{-19}}{2} \\\\in R.\\\\]\\nThis shows $\\\\mathcal{O}_K \\\\subseteq R$, and combined with Step 2 gives $R = \\\\mathcal{O}_K$.\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\nWe have shown that $R = \\\\mathbb{Z}\\\\left[\\\\frac{1+\\\\sqrt{-19}}{2}\\\\right]$ is exactly the ring of integers $\\\\mathcal{O}_K$ of the finite extension $K = \\\\mathbb{Q}(\\\\sqrt{-19})$ of $\\\\mathbb{Q}$.

Since $\\sqrt{-19}$ is algebraic over $\\mathbb{Q}$ with minimal polynomial $x^2 + 19$, the field $K$ is a quadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$. In particular, $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2$, so $K$ is a finite extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Step 2: Show $R \\subseteq \\mathcal{O}_K$**\nLet $\\alpha \\in R$. Then $\\alpha$ can be written as $\\alpha = a + b\\cdot\\frac{1+\\sqrt{-19}}{2}$ for some $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. We compute the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$:\n\nLet $\\alpha = a + b\\cdot\\frac{1+\\sqrt{-19}}{2} = \\left(a + \\frac{b}{2}\\right) + \\frac{b}{2}\\sqrt{-19}$.\nDefine $m = a + \\frac{b}{2}$ and $n = \\frac{b}{2}$, so $\\alpha = m + n\\sqrt{-19}$ with $m, n \\in \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ is:\n\\begin{align*}\n(x - \\alpha)(x - \\overline{\\alpha}) &= \\left(x - (m + n\\sqrt{-19})\\right)\\left(x - (m - n\\sqrt{-19})\\right) \\\\\n&= x^2 - 2mx + (m^2 + 19n^2).\n\\end{align*}\n\nSince $m = a + \\frac{b}{2}$ and $n = \\frac{b}{2}$, we have:\n\\begin{align*}\nm^2 + 19n^2 &= \\left(a + \\frac{b}{2}\\right)^2 + 19\\left(\\frac{b}{2}\\right)^2 \\\\\n&= a^2 + ab + \\frac{b^2}{4} + \\frac{19b^2}{4} \\\\\n&= a^2 + ab + \\frac{20b^2}{4} \\\\\n&= a^2 + ab + 5b^2.\n\\end{align*}\n\nThus the minimal polynomial is $x^2 - (2a + b)x + (a^2 + ab + 5b^2)$. Since $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, the coefficients $-(2a+b)$ and $a^2 + ab + 5b^2$ are integers. Moreover, the polynomial is monic. Therefore, $\\alpha$ is an algebraic integer, so $\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$. This shows $R \\subseteq \\mathcal{O}_K$.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the general structure theorem for quadratic fields**\nFor a quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ where $d$ is a squarefree integer, the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})}$ is given by:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item $\\mathbb{Z}\\left[\\frac{1+\\sqrt{d}}{2}\\right]$ if $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$\n\\item $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{d}]$ if $d \\equiv 2, 3 \\pmod{4}$\n\\end{itemize}\n\n**Step 4: Check the congruence condition**\nWe have $d = -19$. Computing modulo 4:\n\\[-19 = -20 + 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}.\\]\nThus $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the ring of integers**\nBy the structure theorem, since $d = -19 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, the ring of integers of $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-19})$ is:\n\\[\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}\\left[\\frac{1+\\sqrt{-19}}{2}\\right] = R.\\]\n\n**Step 6: Alternative direct verification (optional)**\nTo verify directly that $R$ contains all algebraic integers in $K$, let $\\beta \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$. Since $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-19})$, we can write $\\beta = \\frac{u + v\\sqrt{-19}}{2}$ for some $u, v \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. The minimal polynomial of $\\beta$ is $x^2 - ux + \\frac{u^2 + 19v^2}{4}$. For $\\beta$ to be an algebraic integer, we need $u \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\frac{u^2 + 19v^2}{4} \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. This implies $u^2 + 19v^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$.\n\nSince $u \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, $u^2 \\equiv 0$ or $1 \\pmod{4}$. For $u^2 + 19v^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$, and noting that $19 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, we have:\n- If $u$ is even, then $u^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$, so $19v^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$, which implies $v^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$, so $v$ is even.\n- If $u$ is odd, then $u^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, so $19v^2 \\equiv 3v^2 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, which implies $v^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, so $v$ is odd.\n\nThus $u$ and $v$ have the same parity.
