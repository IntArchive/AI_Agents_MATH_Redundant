For each n ∈ ℕ, let e_n ∈ P be the standard basis vector where e_n has 1 in the n-th coordinate and 0 in all other coordinates.\\n\\nAssume for contradiction that P is a free ℤ-module. Since ℤ is a principal ideal domain (PID), any free ℤ-module is isomorphic to a direct sum ⊕_{I} ℤ for some index set I. Therefore, if P were free, we would have P ≅ ⊕_{I} ℤ for some index set I.\\n\\n**Step 2: Analyzing Hom_ℤ(P, ℤ)**\\nConsider the set of ℤ-linear homomorphisms from P to ℤ, denoted Hom_ℤ(P, ℤ). We will analyze the structure of these homomorphisms.\\n\\n**Step 3: Lemma - Finite support of homomorphisms**\\nClaim: For any φ ∈ Hom_ℤ(P, ℤ), there exists a finite subset F ⊆ ℕ such that φ((a_n)_{n∈ℕ}) depends only on the coordinates a_i for i ∈ F. In other words, φ has finite support.\\n\\nProof of claim: Suppose for contradiction that φ does not have finite support. Then there exist infinitely many indices i ∈ ℕ such that φ(e_i) ≠ 0. Let S = {i ∈ ℕ : φ(e_i) ≠ 0} be this infinite set.\\n\\nConsider the element x ∈ P defined by:\\nx_i = 1 for all i ∈ S\\nx_i = 0 for all i ∉ S\\n\\nSince φ is ℤ-linear, we have:\\nφ(x) = φ(∑_{i∈S} e_i) = ∑_{i∈S} φ(e_i)\\n\\nBut this is an infinite sum of nonzero integers. In ℤ, infinite sums are not defined - ℤ only has finite addition. More formally, for φ to be well-defined as a ℤ-module homomorphism, the value φ(x) must be a single integer. However, the expression ∑_{i∈S} φ(e_i) represents an infinite sum of nonzero integers, which does not converge to any integer (indeed, in ℤ there is no notion of convergence for infinite sums). This contradicts the assumption that φ is a well-defined ℤ-linear map.\\n\\nTherefore, φ must have finite support. That is, there exists a finite subset F ⊆ ℕ such that if (a_n) and (b_n) are elements of P with a_i = b_i for all i ∈ F, then φ((a_n)) = φ((b_n)).\\n\\n**Step 4: Structure of Hom_ℤ(P, ℤ)**\\nFrom the lemma, each φ ∈ Hom_ℤ(P, ℤ) factors through a finite product. More precisely, for each φ, there exists a finite subset F ⊆ ℕ such that φ factors as:\\nP → ∏_{i∈F} ℤ ≅ ℤ^{|F|} → ℤ\\nwhere the first map is the projection onto the coordinates in F, and the second map is a ℤ-linear map from ℤ^{|F|} to ℤ.\\n\\n**Step 5: Cardinality of Hom_ℤ(P, ℤ)**\\nWe now count the number of such homomorphisms:\\n1. There are countably many finite subsets F ⊆ ℕ.\\n2. For each finite subset F with |F| = k, Hom_ℤ(ℤ^k, ℤ) ≅ ℤ^k, which is countable.\\n3. Therefore, the total number of homomorphisms from P to ℤ is at most countable: |Hom_ℤ(P, ℤ)| ≤ ℵ₀.\\n\\n**Step 6: Cardinality for free modules**\\nNow consider what would happen if P were free, i.e., P ≅ ⊕_{I} ℤ for some index set I. For a free module ⊕_{I} ℤ, any homomorphism to ℤ is determined by its values on basis elements. More precisely:\\nHom_ℤ(⊕_{I} ℤ, ℤ) ≅ ∏_{I} Hom_ℤ(ℤ, ℤ) ≅ ∏_{I} ℤ = ℤ^I\\n\\nSince Hom_ℤ(ℤ, ℤ) ≅ ℤ (each homomorphism is multiplication by some integer), we have |Hom_ℤ(⊕_{I} ℤ, ℤ)| = |ℤ^I|.\\n\\n**Step 7: Comparing cardinalities**\\nIf I is finite, then P ≅ ⊕_{I} ℤ would be finitely generated, but P = ∏_{ℕ} ℤ is clearly not finitely generated (it contains elements with infinitely many nonzero coordinates). Therefore, if P were free, I must be infinite.\\n\\nFor any infinite set I, |ℤ^I| ≥ 2^{|I|} ≥ 2^ℵ₀, which is uncountable. In particular, |Hom_ℤ(⊕_{I} ℤ, ℤ)| is uncountable.\\n\\n**Step 8: Contradiction**\\nWe have shown:\\n- If P were free, then |Hom_ℤ(P, ℤ)| would be uncountable.\\n- But we proved directly that |Hom_ℤ(P, ℤ)| is at most countable.\\n\\nThis is a contradiction. Therefore, our initial assumption that P is free must be false.\\n\\n**Conclusion:**\\nThe ℤ-module P = ∏_{n∈ℕ} ℤ is not a free ℤ-module.\\n\\n**Additional note:** The key insight is that while a free module ⊕_{I} ℤ allows homomorphisms that can assign arbitrary integer values independently to each basis element (giving uncountably many homomorphisms when I is infinite), the direct product ∏_{ℕ} ℤ only admits homomorphisms with finite support, which are countable in number. This discrepancy reveals that P cannot be free.\"\n}\n###END_OF_FORMAT###"

While the overall strategy is sound and many steps are correct, there is a critical flaw in the proof of the lemma in Step 3, which renders the entire argument invalid as presented.\n\n### Detailed Review\n\n*   **Overall Strategy:** The approach is valid. It aims to show that if $P$ were free, its dual module $\\text{Hom}_{\\mathbb{Z}}(P, \\mathbb{Z})$ would have an uncountable cardinality, while a direct analysis of $\\text{Hom}_{\\mathbb{Z}}(P, \\mathbb{Z})$ shows it to be countable. This contradiction would prove that $P$ is not free.\n\n*   **Correct Steps:**\n    *   **Step 1 (Setup):** The initial setup and assumption for contradiction are correct.\n    *   **Step 6 & 7 (Analysis of a Free Module's Dual):** The argument that if $P$ were a free module, it must be of infinite rank, and consequently its dual module $\\text{Hom}_{\\mathbb{Z}}(P, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\prod_I \\mathbb{Z}$ would be uncountable, is correct.\n    *   **Steps 4, 5, 8 (Consequences of the Lemma):** The reasoning that flows from the lemma in Step 3 is also correct. If it were true that every homomorphism $\\phi: P \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ has finite support, then the set of all such homomorphisms would indeed be a countable union of countable sets, and therefore countable. The contradiction in Step 8 follows logically.\n\n*   **The Flaw:**\n    *   **Step 3 (Lemma - Finite support of homomorphisms):** The proof provided for this crucial lemma is incorrect. The lemma itself is a known result (part of Specker's theorem), but the justification given here is fallacious.\n    *   **The Error:** The proof considers an element $x \\in P$ corresponding to an infinite set of indices $S$ and claims that $\\phi(x) = \\phi(\\sum_{i \\in S} e_i) = \\sum_{i \\in S} \\phi(e_i)$. This step is invalid because the $\\mathbb{Z}$-linearity of a homomorphism $\\phi$ applies only to **finite** sums. The expression $\\sum_{i \\in S} e_i$ is an infinite sum, which is not a defined operation in the algebraic structure of the module in a way that linearity can be applied. The element $x$ is the limit of the partial sums in the product topology, but a module homomorphism is not guaranteed to be continuous with respect to this topology. Therefore, one cannot conclude that $\\phi(x)$ is equal to the infinite sum of the images of the basis vectors.\n\n### Conclusion of Review\n\nBecause the proof of the central lemma in Step 3 is flawed, the entire proof is not valid. The argument fails to establish its claim that $|\\text{Hom}_{\\mathbb{Z}}(P, \\mathbb{Z})|$ is countable. While the conclusion of the proof is a correct mathematical theorem, the argument presented does not constitute a correct proof."

The expression $\\sum_{i \\in S} e_i$ is an infinite sum, which is not a defined operation in the algebraic structure of the module in a way that linearity can be applied. The element $x$ is the limit of the partial sums in the product topology, but a module homomorphism is not guaranteed to be continuous with respect to this topology. Therefore, one cannot conclude that $\\phi(x)$ is equal to the infinite sum of the images of the basis vectors.\n\n### Conclusion of Review\n\nBecause the proof of the central lemma in Step 3 is flawed, the entire proof is not valid. The argument fails to establish its claim that $|\\text{Hom}_{\\mathbb{Z}}(P, \\mathbb{Z})|$ is countable. While the conclusion of the proof is a correct mathematical theorem, the argument presented does not constitute a correct proof."
