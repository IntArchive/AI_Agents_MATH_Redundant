    "Content":"The divisibility rule for $3$ is well-known: if you add up the digits of $n$ and the sum is divisible by $3$, then $n$ is divisible by three.  This is quite helpful for determining if really large numbers are multiples of three, because we can recursively apply this rule: $$1212582439 \\rightarrow 37 \\rightarrow 10\\rightarrow 1 \\implies 3\\not\\mid 1212582439$$\n$$124524 \\rightarrow 18 \\rightarrow 9 \\implies 3\\mid 124524$$ This works for as many numbers as I've tried.  However, I'm not sure how this may be proven .  Thus, my question is: Given a positive integer $n$ and that $3\\mid\\text{(the sum of the digits of $n$)}$, how may we prove that $3\\mid n$?",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"HINT: Suppose that you have a four-digit number $n$ that is written $abcd$. Then $$\\begin{align*}\nn&=10^3a+10^2b+10c+d\\\\\n&=(999+1)a+(99+1)b+(9+1)c+d\\\\\n&=(999a+99b+9c)+(a+b+c+d)\\\\\n&=3(333a+33b+3c)+(a+b+c+d)\\;,\n\\end{align*}$$ so when you divide $n$ by $3$, you’ll get $$333a+33b+3c+\\frac{a+b+c+d}3\\;.$$ The remainder is clearly going to come from the division $\\frac{a+b+c+d}3$, since $333a+33b+3c$ is an integer. Now generalize: make a similar argument for any number of digits, not just four. (If you know about congruences and modular arithmetic, you can do it very compactly.)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So the question is about proving the divisibility rule for 3, which states that if the sum of the digits of a number is divisible by 3, then the number itself is divisible by 3. \n\nFirst, I need to recall how numbers are structured. Any number can be expressed in terms of its digits. For example, the number 123 is actually 1*100 + 2*10 + 3*1. Each digit is multiplied by a power of 10 corresponding to its position. So, in general, a number n with digits d_k, d_{k-1}, ..., d_1, d_0 can be written as:\n\nn = d_k * 10^k + d_{k-1} * 10^{k-1} + ... + d_1 * 10^1 + d_0 * 10^0\n\nNow, the key idea here might be related to modulo 3. Since we're dealing with divisibility by 3, looking at the number modulo 3 makes sense. If n ≡ 0 mod 3, then n is divisible by 3.\n\nLet me consider each term in the expansion of n. Each term is a digit multiplied by a power of 10. So, if I can find what 10^m is congruent to modulo 3, that might help. \n\nI know that 10 ≡ 1 mod 3 because 10 divided by 3 is 3 with a remainder of 1. Therefore, 10^m ≡ 1^m ≡ 1 mod 3 for any integer m ≥ 0. \n\nSo, substituting back into the expression for n modulo 3:\n\nn ≡ d_k * 1 + d_{k-1} * 1 + ... + d_1 * 1 + d_0 * 1 mod 3\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nn ≡ d_k + d_{k-1} + ... + d_1 + d_0 mod 3\n\nTherefore, n modulo 3 is equal to the sum of its digits modulo 3. So, if the sum of the digits is divisible by 3, then n ≡ 0 mod 3, which means 3 divides n. That seems to be the proof.\n\nWait, but let me check if there are any hidden assumptions here. The problem states that n is a positive integer. The key step is that 10 ≡ 1 mod 3, which holds. Each power of 10 will be congruent to 1, so each digit contributes itself to the total modulo 3. Therefore, the sum of the digits is congruent to the number itself modulo 3. Hence, if the sum is divisible by 3, the number is too. \n\nI think that covers it. The main assumptions are that n is a positive integer and that the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. The problem is to show that under these conditions, n is divisible by 3. The proof uses the fact that 10 ≡ 1 mod 3, leading each digit's place value to contribute the digit itself modulo 3.",

We will prove that $3 \\mid n$ (i.e., $n$ is divisible by $3$) if and only if $3 \\mid S(n)$, where $S(n)$ denotes the sum of the decimal digits of $n$.\n\n**Step 1: Decimal representation.**\nWrite $n$ in its decimal (base-10) expansion:\n$$n = a_k \\times 10^k + a_{k-1} \\times 10^{k-1} + \\cdots + a_1 \\times 10 + a_0,$$\nwhere each $a_i$ is an integer digit with $0 \\le a_i \\le 9$, and $a_k \\neq 0$ (since $n$ is positive).\n\n**Step 2: Modular property of $10$.**\nObserve that $10 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, because $10 = 9 + 1$ and $9$ is divisible by $3$. In other words, $10 \\equiv 1 \\ (\\text{mod } 3)$.\n\n**Step 3: Powers of $10$ modulo $3$.**\nUsing the fact that congruence is preserved under multiplication, we have for any non‑negative integer $m$:\n$$10^m \\equiv 1^m \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}.$$\nThus every power of $10$ is congruent to $1$ modulo $3$.\n\n**Step 4: Apply congruence to the decimal expansion.**\nTaking the expansion of $n$ modulo $3$ and using the result of Step 3:\n\\begin{align*}\nn &\\equiv a_k \\times 10^k + a_{k-1} \\times 10^{k-1} + \\cdots + a_1 \\times 10 + a_0 \\pmod{3} \\\\\n  &\\equiv a_k \\times 1 + a_{k-1} \\times 1 + \\cdots + a_1 \\times 1 + a_0 \\pmod{3} \\\\\n  &\\equiv a_k + a_{k-1} + \\cdots + a_1 + a_0 \\pmod{3}.\n\\end{align*}\n\n**Step 5: Interpretation.**\nThe last expression is exactly the sum of the decimal digits of $n$, which we denote by $S(n) = a_k + a_{k-1} + \\cdots + a_1 + a_0$. Hence we have proved\n$$n \\equiv S(n) \\pmod{3}.$$\n\n**Step 6: Divisibility criterion.**\nFrom the congruence $n \\equiv S(n) \\ (\\text{mod } 3)$ we obtain:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item If $3 \\mid n$ (i.e., $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$), then $S(n) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, so $3 \\mid S(n)$.\n\\item Conversely, if $3 \\mid S(n)$ (i.e., $S(n) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$), then $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, so $3 \\mid n$.\n\\end{itemize}\nTherefore $n$ is divisible by $3$ **if and only if** the sum of its decimal digits is divisible by $3$. This completes the proof.\n\n**Remark:** The argument does not depend on the particular digits $a_i$; it relies only on the fact that $10 \\equiv 1 \\ (\\text{mod } 3)$.
