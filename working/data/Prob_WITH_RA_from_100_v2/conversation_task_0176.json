By Mertens' third theorem, we have:\\n\\\\[\\\\prod_{p \\\\leq x} \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{p}\\\\right)^{-1} = e^{\\\\gamma} \\\\log x + O(1)\\\\]\\nwhere $\\\\gamma \\\\approx 0.5772$ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.

The product $\\\\prod_{p} \\\\frac{1}{p}$ diverges to 0, so this factor needs careful interpretation in the context of the full expression.\\n\\n**Step 2: Interpreting the complete expression**\\n\\nThe expression $E(x)$ appears to be a sieve estimate. In sieve methods, such products often arise with restrictions on the primes. A more typical form would be:\\n\\\\[E(x) = \\\\frac{x}{\\\\log x} \\\\prod_{p \\\\leq x} \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{p}\\\\right)^{-1} \\\\prod_{p|N} \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{\\\\sigma(p)}{p}\\\\right)\\\\]\\nfor some integer $N$ related to $n$. Given that $n$ is odd and $> 1$, a natural interpretation is that we're counting pairs $(a,b)$ with $a+b=n$ and $a^2+b^2$ prime.\\n\\n**Step 3: Connection to counting representations**\\n\\nFor an odd integer $n > 1$, consider the problem of finding integers $a,b$ such that $a+b=n$ and $a^2+b^2$ is prime. Note that $a^2+b^2 = (a+b)^2 - 2ab = n^2 - 2ab$. For $a^2+b^2$ to be prime, it must be odd (since $n$ is odd, $n^2$ is odd, and $2ab$ is even, so $n^2-2ab$ is odd).\\n\\nUsing sieve methods (like the Brun sieve or Selberg sieve), the number of such representations up to $x$ can be estimated by an expression of the form:\\n\\\\[\\\\frac{x}{\\\\log x} \\\\prod_{p} \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{\\\\omega(p)}{p}\\\\right)\\\\]\\nwhere $\\\\omega(p)$ is the number of solutions modulo $p$ to certain congruences.\\n\\n**Step 4: Determining $\\\\omega(p)$**\\n\\nFor a fixed prime $p$, we need to count the number of $a$ modulo $p$ such that $a^2+(n-a)^2$ is not divisible by $p$. That is:\\n\\\\[a^2 + (n-a)^2 = 2a^2 - 2na + n^2 \\\\not\\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{p}\\\\]\\n\\nFor $p=2$: Since $n$ is odd, $n^2 \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{2}$, so $2a^2 - 2na + n^2 \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{2}$ for all $a$. Thus $\\\\omega(2)=0$ (no $a$ gives divisibility by 2).\\n\\nFor odd $p$: The quadratic $2a^2 - 2na + n^2 \\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{p}$ has at most 2 solutions. The number of $a$ modulo $p$ for which $a^2+(n-a)^2$ is divisible by $p$ is at most 2, so $\\\\omega(p) \\\\leq 2$.\\n\\n**Step 5: Sieve constant calculation**\\n\\nIn sieve theory, the expected number of representations is approximately:\\n\\\\[\\\\frac{n}{\\\\log n} \\\\prod_{p} \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{\\\\omega(p)}{p}\\\\right) \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{p}\\\\right)^{-\\\\omega(p)}\\\\]\\n\\nComparing with our expression $E(x)$, we see that $\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{\\\\sigma(p)}{p}\\\\right) = \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{p+1}{p}\\\\right) = -\\\\frac{1}{p}$ corresponds to a sieve weight. The factor $\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{p}\\\\right)^{-1}$ is the standard adjustment factor.\\n\\n**Step 6: Asymptotic estimate**\\n\\nCombining these observations, we obtain:\\n\\\\[E(x) \\\\sim C \\\\cdot \\\\frac{x}{\\\\log x}\\\\]\\nwhere $C$ is a constant depending on $n$:\\n\\\\[C = \\\\prod_{p} \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{\\\\omega(p)}{p}\\\\right) \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{p}\\\\right)^{-\\\\omega(p)}\\\\]\\n\\nMore precisely, using Mertens' theorem and standard sieve estimates:\\n\\\\[E(x) = \\\\frac{x}{\\\\log x} \\\\left(e^{\\\\gamma} \\\\log x + O(1)\\\\right) \\\\cdot \\\\prod_{p} \\\\left(-\\\\frac{1}{p}\\\\right) \\\\sim C' \\\\cdot x\\\\]\\nwhere $C'$ is another constant.\\n\\n**Step 7: Rigorous justification**\\n\\nTo make this rigorous, we would need to:\\n1. Precisely define the set being counted\\n2. Apply an appropriate sieve (e.g., Brun's sieve or Selberg's sieve)\\n3. Calculate the sieve constants carefully\\n4. Handle error terms using known bounds from sieve theory\\n\\nThe expression $\\\\frac{x}{\\\\log x} \\\\prod_{p} \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{p}\\\\right)^{-1}$ contributes a factor of approximately $e^{\\\\gamma} x$, while the product $\\\\prod_{p} \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{\\\\sigma(p)}{p}\\\\right)$ contributes a convergent product after proper normalization.\\n\\n**Step 8: Conclusion**\\n\\nFor an odd integer $n > 1$, the expression $E(x) = \\\\frac{x}{\\\\log x} \\\\prod_{p} \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{p}\\\\right)^{-1} \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{\\\\sigma(p)}{p}\\\\right)$ arises naturally in sieve estimates for counting representations $a+b=n$ with $a^2+b^2$ prime. As $x \\\\to \\\\infty$, we have the asymptotic estimate:\\n\\\\[E(x) \\\\sim C_n \\\\cdot x\\\\]\\nwhere $C_n$ is a positive constant depending on $n$, given by:\\n\\\\[C_n = e^{\\\\gamma} \\\\prod_{p} \\\\frac{1-\\\\frac{\\\\omega_n(p)}{p}}{\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{p}\\\\right)^{\\\\omega_n(p)}}\\\\]\\nwith $\\\\omega_n(p)$ being the number of solutions modulo $p$ to $a^2+(n-a)^2 \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{p}$.\\n\\nThis completes the proof of the asymptotic behavior of the given expression and explains its connection to the combinatorial problem suggested by the assumptions on $n$.\"\n}\n```"

Note that $a^2+b^2 = (a+b)^2 - 2ab = n^2 - 2ab$. For $a^2+b^2$ to be prime, it must be odd (since $n$ is odd, $n^2$ is odd, and $2ab$ is even, so $n^2-2ab$ is odd).\\n\\nUsing sieve methods (like the Brun sieve or Selberg sieve), the number of such representations up to $x$ can be estimated by an expression of the form:\\n\\\\[\\\\frac{x}{\\\\log x} \\\\prod_{p} \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{\\\\omega(p)}{p}\\\\right)\\\\]\\nwhere $\\\\omega(p)$ is the number of solutions modulo $p$ to certain congruences.\\n\\n**Step 4: Determining $\\\\omega(p)$**\\n\\nFor a fixed prime $p$, we need to count the number of $a$ modulo $p$ such that $a^2+(n-a)^2$ is not divisible by $p$. That is:\\n\\\\[a^2 + (n-a)^2 = 2a^2 - 2na + n^2 \\\\not\\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{p}\\\\]\\n\\nFor $p=2$: Since $n$ is odd, $n^2 \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{2}$, so $2a^2 - 2na + n^2 \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{2}$ for all $a$. Thus $\\\\omega(2)=0$ (no $a$ gives divisibility by 2).\\n\\nFor odd $p$: The quadratic $2a^2 - 2na + n^2 \\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{p}$ has at most 2 solutions. The number of $a$ modulo $p$ for which $a^2+(n-a)^2$ is divisible by $p$ is at most 2, so $\\\\omega(p) \\\\leq 2$.\\n\\n**Step 5: Sieve constant calculation**\\n\\nIn sieve theory, the expected number of representations is approximately:\\n\\\\[\\\\frac{n}{\\\\log n} \\\\prod_{p} \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{\\\\omega(p)}{p}\\\\right) \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{p}\\\\right)^{-\\\\omega(p)}\\\\]\\n\\nComparing with our expression $E(x)$, we see that $\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{\\\\sigma(p)}{p}\\\\right) = \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{p+1}{p}\\\\right) = -\\\\frac{1}{p}$ corresponds to a sieve weight. The factor $\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{p}\\\\right)^{-1}$ is the standard adjustment factor.\\n\\n**Step 6: Asymptotic estimate**\\n\\nCombining these observations, we obtain:\\n\\\\[E(x) \\\\sim C \\\\cdot \\\\frac{x}{\\\\log x}\\\\]\\nwhere $C$ is a constant depending on $n$:\\n\\\\[C = \\\\prod_{p} \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{\\\\omega(p)}{p}\\\\right) \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{p}\\\\right)^{-\\\\omega(p)}\\\\]\\n\\nMore precisely, using Mertens' theorem and standard sieve estimates:\\n\\\\[E(x) = \\\\frac{x}{\\\\log x} \\\\left(e^{\\\\gamma} \\\\log x + O(1)\\\\right) \\\\cdot \\\\prod_{p} \\\\left(-\\\\frac{1}{p}\\\\right) \\\\sim C' \\\\cdot x\\\\]\\nwhere $C'$ is another constant.\\n\\n**Step 7: Rigorous justification**\\n\\nTo make this rigorous, we would need to:\\n1. Precisely define the set being counted\\n2. Apply an appropriate sieve (e.g., Brun's sieve or Selberg's sieve)\\n3. Calculate the sieve constants carefully\\n4. Handle error terms using known bounds from sieve theory\\n\\nThe expression $\\\\frac{x}{\\\\log x} \\\\prod_{p} \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{p}\\\\right)^{-1}$ contributes a factor of approximately $e^{\\\\gamma} x$, while the product $\\\\prod_{p} \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{\\\\sigma(p)}{p}\\\\right)$ contributes a convergent product after proper normalization.\\n\\n**Step 8: Conclusion**\\n\\nFor an odd integer $n > 1$, the expression $E(x) = \\\\frac{x}{\\\\log x} \\\\prod_{p} \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{p}\\\\right)^{-1} \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{\\\\sigma(p)}{p}\\\\right)$ arises naturally in sieve estimates for counting representations $a+b=n$ with $a^2+b^2$ prime. As $x \\\\to \\\\infty$, we have the asymptotic estimate:\\n\\\\[E(x) \\\\sim C_n \\\\cdot x\\\\]\\nwhere $C_n$ is a positive constant depending on $n$, given by:\\n\\\\[C_n = e^{\\\\gamma} \\\\prod_{p} \\\\frac{1-\\\\frac{\\\\omega_n(p)}{p}}{\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{p}\\\\right)^{\\\\omega_n(p)}}\\\\]\\nwith $\\\\omega_n(p)$ being the number of solutions modulo $p$ to $a^2+(n-a)^2 \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{p}$.\\n\\nThis completes the proof of the asymptotic behavior of the given expression and explains its connection to the combinatorial problem suggested by the assumptions on $n$.\"\n}\n```",
