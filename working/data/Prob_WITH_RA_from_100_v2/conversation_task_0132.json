Since f is continuous on ℝ (assumption 1) and differentiable on ℝ (since f' exists and is continuous by assumption 2), f satisfies the hypotheses of the Mean Value Theorem on [n, n+1]. Therefore, for each integer n, there exists a point c_n ∈ (n, n+1) such that:\n\nf'(c_n) = f(n+1) - f(n)\n\nThis is the Mean Value Theorem applied to f on [n, n+1].\n\nStep 3: Analyze the limit as n → ∞\nConsider what happens as n → ∞ (through integer values).\n\nFirst, note that c_n ∈ (n, n+1), so as n → ∞, we have c_n → ∞. Since lim_{x→∞} f'(x) = M exists, and c_n → ∞, we have:\n\nlim_{n→∞} f'(c_n) = M\n\nThis follows from the definition of limit: if lim_{x→∞} f'(x) = M, then for any sequence {x_n} with x_n → ∞, we have lim_{n→∞} f'(x_n) = M.\n\nStep 4: Analyze f(n+1) - f(n) as n → ∞\nSince lim_{x→∞} f(x) = L exists, we have:\n\nlim_{n→∞} f(n) = L and lim_{n→∞} f(n+1) = L\n\nTherefore:\n\nlim_{n→∞} [f(n+1) - f(n)] = L - L = 0\n\nStep 5: Relate the two limits\nFrom Step 2, we have f'(c_n) = f(n+1) - f(n) for each n.\nTaking limits as n → ∞ on both sides:\n\nlim_{n→∞} f'(c_n) = lim_{n→∞} [f(n+1) - f(n)]\n\nFrom Step 3, the left side equals M.\nFrom Step 4, the right side equals 0.\n\nThus we have:\n\nM = 0\n\nStep 6: Conclusion\nSince M = lim_{x→∞} f'(x) and we have shown M = 0, we conclude:\n\nlim_{x→∞} f'(x) = 0\n\nThis completes the proof.\n\nAdditional notes:\n- The continuity of f' (assumption 2) ensures that f is differentiable on ℝ, which is needed to apply the Mean Value Theorem.\n- The continuity of f (assumption 1) is also needed for the Mean Value Theorem.\n- The existence of the limits (assumptions 3 and 4) is crucial for the argument.\n- The proof uses the fact that if lim_{x→∞} g(x) exists and equals A, then for any sequence {x_n} with x_n → ∞, we have lim_{n→∞} g(x_n) = A. This is applied to both f and f'.\n- The choice of integer intervals [n, n+1] is convenient but not essential; any sequence of intervals of fixed positive length tending to infinity would work.",
