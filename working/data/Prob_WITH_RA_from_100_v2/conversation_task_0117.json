The inequality $\\sqrt{2n} \\le n-1$ does not hold for all positive integers $n$. For example:\n\n- When $n=1$: $\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414 \\le 0$ is false\n- When $n=2$: $\\sqrt{4} = 2 \\le 1$ is false\n- When $n=3$: $\\sqrt{6} \\approx 2.449 \\le 2$ is false\n- When $n=4$: $\\sqrt{8} \\approx 2.828 \\le 3$ is true\n\nHowever, we can prove that $\\sqrt{2n} \\le n-1$ holds for $n \\ge 4$:\n\n**Proof for $n \\ge 4$:**\n\n1. We want to show: $\\sqrt{2n} \\le n-1$ for $n \\ge 4$.\n\n2. Since both sides are non-negative for $n \\ge 4$, we can square both sides without changing the inequality direction:\n   $$(\\sqrt{2n})^2 \\le (n-1)^2$$\n   $$2n \\le n^2 - 2n + 1$$\n\n3. Rearranging terms:\n   $$0 \\le n^2 - 4n + 1$$\n\n4. Consider the quadratic function $f(n) = n^2 - 4n + 1$. Its roots are:\n   $$n = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 - 4}}{2} = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{12}}{2} = \\frac{4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{3}}{2} = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{3}$$\n   $$n \\approx 2 \\pm 1.732 = 0.268 \\text{ and } 3.732$$\n\n5. Since the quadratic $f(n)$ opens upward (coefficient of $n^2$ is positive), $f(n) \\ge 0$ for $n \\le 2-\\sqrt{3}$ or $n \\ge 2+\\sqrt{3}$.\n\n6. For integer $n \\ge 4$, we have $n \\ge 4 > 2+\\sqrt{3} \\approx 3.732$, so $f(n) \\ge 0$.\n\n7. Specifically, for $n=4$: $f(4) = 16 - 16 + 1 = 1 > 0$.\n\n8. Therefore, $\\sqrt{2n} \\le n-1$ holds for all $n \\ge 4$.\n\n**Note:** This proof is independent of the sequence $a_n$ defined in the assumption. If the problem intended to relate $\\sqrt{2n} \\le n-1$ to the sequence $a_n$, additional context or a corrected problem statement would be needed.",
