The best I could do was to express it in terms of Euler Sums. Let $I$ denote the integral. $$I=-\\frac{\\pi^2}{24}\\zeta(3)+2\\sum_{r=2}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^r (H_r)^2}{r^3}-2\\sum_{r=2}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^r H_r}{r^4}+2 \\sum_{r=2}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^r H_r^{(2)}H_r}{r^2}-2\\sum_{r=2}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^r H_r^{(2)}}{r^3}$$ where $\\displaystyle H_r^{(n)}=\\sum_{n=1}^r \\frac{1}{k^n}$. I am unable to simplify these sums further. Does anyone have any idea on how to solve this integral? Please see here for more details. Some time ago I was able to solve the simpler integral: \\begin{align*} \\int_0^1 \\frac{\\log(1-x)\\log(x)\\log(1+x)}{x}dx &=-\\frac{3 \\pi^4}{160}+\\frac{7\\log(2)}{4}\\zeta(3)-\\frac{\\pi^2 \\log^2(2)}{12} +\\frac{\\log^4(2)}{12} \\\\ &\\quad+ 2 \\text{Li}_4 \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\end{align*} where $\\text{Li}_n(z)$ is the Polylogarithm .",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"Let the considered integral be denoted by $I$. Our starting point is to reduce the number of logarithms of different arguments in the integrand.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure with Assumptions and Problem. The original problem is about proving a specific logarithmic integral equals a combination of zeta functions. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The problem statement mentions integrating from 0 to 1, and the integrand involves logarithms of x, 1-x, and squared log of 1+x, all divided by x. The user also references Euler sums and some previous simpler integral. However, the example provided shows that assumptions are conditions on the variables or functions in the problem. In the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7.\n\nLooking at the current problem, the integral is definite from 0 to 1. The integrand is a product of log functions. The problem is to prove the equality to a specific zeta function combination. The question mentions using Euler sums but being unable to simplify further. The assumptions here might not be as straightforward as the example. Since the integral is over a specific interval, and the functions involved are logarithms, maybe the assumptions are related to the domain of integration and the behavior of the functions involved. However, the original example's assumptions were more about the variables in the problem. Here, perhaps the main assumption is that the integral is taken over the interval [0,1], and the logarithms are defined in their principal branches, but the problem as stated doesn't explicitly mention these. Wait, the user's example had assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. In the current problem, there might not be explicit variables with conditions except for the integral bounds. Since the problem is to prove an equality, the assumptions could be that the integral is evaluated over [0,1], and that the logarithms are real-valued functions defined on that interval. Alternatively, maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond the integral setup. The example given by the user included assumptions that were part of the problem statement but maybe implicit. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem included an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that's a mistake. Wait the original example's problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, perhaps the user made an error in their example. Because in the original problem, the user wrote: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect. But perhaps the user intended to show that in their formatted problem, they included the assumption that n is an integer (which was given in the original problem) and then an additional assumption, but that might not be accurate. Wait, maybe the user's example is a mistake. But regardless, I need to follow the format they specified. \n\nLooking back at the current problem. The integral is from 0 to 1, and the integrand is a combination of log functions. The problem is to prove the integral equals that expression involving zeta functions. The original problem's assumptions, according to the user's format, should list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. In this case, perhaps:\n\nAssumption: The integral is evaluated over the interval [0, 1].\nAssumption: The logarithms are defined as real-valued functions on their respective domains.\nBut maybe the problem doesn't have explicit assumptions beyond the integral setup. The example given by the user included assumptions that were part of the problem's conditions. However, the original problem here doesn't state any conditions beyond the integral. So perhaps the only assumption is the integral bounds. Alternatively, since the logarithms have singularities at 0 and 1, perhaps assuming convergence of the integral? But that might be an implicit part of the problem rather than an assumption. The example in the user's question had added assumptions beyond the problem statement, like n being divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, that seems like an error. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. That's contradictory. So maybe the user made a mistake in their example. But regardless, I need to proceed.\n\nIn the current problem, the user is asking to prove an integral equality. The problem itself is to show that the integral equals the given combination of zeta functions. Since the problem is stated as is, perhaps there are no explicit assumptions beyond the integral's limits. However, in the example, the user included assumptions that were part of the problem's conditions. Wait, in their example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" as an assumption and also \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Unless the original problem was mistyped. Wait, maybe the original problem had a condition that n is divisible by 7, but in the example, it was written as \"for every integer n\". That would be a mistake. But since the user provided that example, perhaps they intended that even if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem adds an assumption. Maybe the user is using that example to show how to extract assumptions from the problem. But in reality, if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", then the assumption should be that n is an integer, but the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. But in their formatted example, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which changes the problem. That seems incorrect. Maybe the user's example is wrong, but I have to follow their format.\n\nIn the current problem, since the question is about an integral from 0 to 1, and the integrand involves log(x), which is defined for x > 0, and log(1-x) which is defined for x < 1. So the domain is (0,1). But the integral is from 0 to 1, so the assumptions might be:\n\nAssumption: The integral is taken over the interval (0, 1).\nAssumption: The logarithms are defined in their principal branches.\n\nBut maybe these are too implicit. Alternatively, since the problem is posed as is, perhaps there are no explicit assumptions. The example given by the user added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, in their example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem added the assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. That seems like a mistake. Therefore, perhaps the user intended that the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. But in this case, the problem as stated doesn't have explicit conditions beyond the integral bounds and the functions involved. Therefore, maybe the only assumption is the integral bounds. So:\n\nAssumption: The integral is evaluated from x=0 to x=1.\n\nBut the example's format requires each assumption to address one property or condition applied to one object. So here, perhaps that's the only assumption. Alternatively, maybe the log functions are defined and integrable over the interval, but that's part of the problem's nature. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption: The integral is evaluated over the interval [0, 1].\n\nBut the problem as stated in the example included assumptions even if they were part of the problem's original statement. So in the example, even though the problem said \"for every integer n\", they listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So following that, here the assumption would be that the integral is from 0 to 1, and maybe that the integrand is as defined. But perhaps the user wants each assumption line by line. Since the problem is to evaluate the integral from 0 to 1, that's the main assumption. The integrand's components are defined in that interval except at endpoints, but the integral is improper. However, the problem states the integral equals a certain value, implying convergence. So maybe the assumption is that the integral converges. But I'm not sure. The user's example had two assumptions, but here there might be only one. Alternatively, maybe no assumptions are needed beyond the integral setup. But to follow the example, even if the original problem states \"for every integer n\", they listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So here, perhaps:\n\nAssumption: x is a real number in the interval [0, 1].\n\nBut I think the key is to list the conditions that are necessary for the problem to hold. Since the problem is about an integral from 0 to 1, the assumption is that the integral is over that interval. The example's formatting seems to include even the obvious assumptions. So I'll proceed with that.",
