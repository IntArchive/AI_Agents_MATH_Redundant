    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants to prove that for any integer n, n divides φ(2ⁿ - 1), where φ is Euler's totient function. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the problem is asking. The Euler totient function φ(m) counts the number of integers up to m that are coprime to m. So here, we need to show that when you take 2ⁿ - 1, compute φ of that number, and then divide by n, the result is an integer. The example given is when n=4: φ(2⁴ -1) = φ(15) = 8, and 8 divided by 4 is 2, which is an integer. The user also mentions that if 2^p -1 is a prime (a Mersenne prime), then p divides φ(2^p -1) because φ(prime) is prime -1, and 2^p -2 would be divisible by p by Fermat's little theorem. But the problem states that this holds for any n, not just primes.\n\nSo, how to approach this? Let's think about the structure of 2ⁿ -1. If n is a composite number, say n=ab, then 2^a -1 and 2^b -1 might be factors of 2ⁿ -1. But Euler's totient function is multiplicative over coprime factors. Maybe we can factor 2ⁿ -1 into its prime factors and use the multiplicative property of φ.\n\nBut first, let's recall that if m = p₁^k₁ p₂^k₂ ... p_r^k_r, then φ(m) = m * product_{i=1 to r} (1 - 1\/p_i). So φ(2ⁿ -1) = (2ⁿ -1) * product over all distinct prime factors p of (1 - 1\/p). Therefore, φ(2ⁿ -1) is divisible by n. We need to show that (2ⁿ -1) * product (1 - 1\/p) is divisible by n.\n\nWait, but (2ⁿ -1) is being multiplied by a product of terms, each of which is (1 - 1\/p). So maybe it's better to look at the prime factors of 2ⁿ -1. Let's consider that for each prime divisor p of 2ⁿ -1, the order of 2 modulo p divides n. Because 2ⁿ ≡ 1 mod p, so the order of 2 modulo p is the smallest positive integer d such that 2^d ≡ 1 mod p, which must divide n. Therefore, d divides n. \n\nFurthermore, since the multiplicative group modulo p has order p-1, the order d of 2 modulo p must divide p-1. Therefore, d divides both n and p-1. So p ≡ 1 mod d, and since d divides n, p ≡ 1 mod some divisor of n. \n\nBut how does this relate to φ(2ⁿ -1)? Each prime p dividing 2ⁿ -1 has order dividing n, so p ≡ 1 mod d where d divides n. Then in the Euler totient function, φ(2ⁿ -1) = product_{p | 2ⁿ -1} (p - 1) * p^{k_p -1}, where k_p is the exponent of p in the factorization of 2ⁿ -1. Hmm, but each p ≡ 1 mod d, so p -1 is divisible by d, which divides n. Therefore, each (p - 1) is divisible by d, which divides n. Therefore, the product of (p -1) over all prime factors would be divisible by n? Wait, but it's more complicated because each p may contribute different factors. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the fact that φ(2ⁿ -1) is the number of integers less than 2ⁿ -1 that are coprime to it. Since 2 is a primitive root modulo some primes? Not sure. \n\nAnother approach: Let’s consider that the multiplicative group modulo m, where m = 2ⁿ -1, is a group of order φ(m). The element 2 has order n modulo m, because 2ⁿ ≡ 1 mod m, and since m = 2ⁿ -1, 2^d ≡1 mod m implies d ≥ n. Wait, but 2ⁿ ≡1 mod m, and if d is the order, then d divides φ(m). But we need to relate φ(m) to n. Wait, here the order of 2 modulo m is n, so by Lagrange's theorem, n divides φ(m). Because the order of the element 2 in the multiplicative group modulo m is n, and the order of the group is φ(m), so n divides φ(m). Therefore, φ(m) is divisible by n. That's exactly what we need to prove. \n\nWait, but is the order of 2 modulo m exactly n? Let's check. Since m = 2ⁿ -1, then 2ⁿ ≡ 1 mod m. Suppose there's a smaller d < n such that 2^d ≡1 mod m. Then m divides 2^d -1. But m = 2ⁿ -1, so 2^d -1 ≥ 2ⁿ -1 implies d ≥ n. Contradiction. Therefore, the order of 2 modulo m is exactly n. Hence, the multiplicative order of 2 modulo m is n, and by Lagrange's theorem, the order of the element divides the order of the group, which is φ(m). Therefore, n divides φ(m). So φ(m)\/n is an integer. \n\nThat seems like a solid proof. So the key insight is that 2 has order n modulo 2ⁿ -1, and since the order of an element divides the order of the group (which is φ(2ⁿ -1)), n must divide φ(2ⁿ -1).\n\nBut wait, does this require that 2 and m are coprime? Yes, because m = 2ⁿ -1 is odd, so 2 and m are coprime. Therefore, 2 is indeed an element of the multiplicative group modulo m. Therefore, its order divides φ(m). Thus, n divides φ(m). \n\nTherefore, the problem is proven by group theory. So the answer would be to note that the multiplicative order of 2 modulo 2ⁿ -1 is n, and since that order must divide φ(2ⁿ -1), n divides φ(2ⁿ -1).",

Since 2 is even, any positive power of 2 (2^n) is divisible by 2, hence even. Therefore, 2^n can be written as 2^n = 2k for some integer k. Then 2^n - 1 = 2k - 1, which is one less than an even number. Any integer of the form 2k - 1 is odd because it leaves remainder 1 when divided by 2. Thus, 2^n - 1 is odd.\n\nStep 2: Show that gcd(2, 2^n - 1) = 1.\nRecall that the greatest common divisor gcd(a, b) is the largest positive integer that divides both a and b. The positive divisors of 2 are exactly 1 and 2. Since 2^n - 1 is odd (from Step 1), it is not divisible by 2. Therefore, 2 does not divide 2^n - 1. The only possible common divisors of 2 and 2^n - 1 are 1 and 2. Since 2 does not divide 2^n - 1, the only common divisor is 1. Hence, gcd(2, 2^n - 1) = 1.\n\nStep 3: Conclude that 2 ∈ U(2^n - 1).\nBy definition, for any integer m > 1, the group of units modulo m, denoted U(m), is the set of integers a such that gcd(a, m) = 1. These are precisely the integers relatively prime to m. Since we have shown that gcd(2, 2^n - 1) = 1, it follows that 2 is relatively prime to 2^n - 1. Therefore, 2 ∈ U(2^n - 1).\n\nThis completes the proof.",
