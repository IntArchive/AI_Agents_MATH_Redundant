    "Content":"exact duplicate of Lebesgue measurable but not Borel measurable BUT! can you please translate Miguel's answer and expand it with a formal proof? I'm totally stuck... In short: Is there a Lebesgue measurable set that is not Borel measurable? They are an order of magnitude apart so there should be plenty examples, but all I can find is \"add a Lebesgue-zero measure set to a Borel measurable set such that it becomes non-Borel-measurable\". But what kind of zero measure set fulfills such a property?",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"Let $\\phi(x)$ be the Cantor function , which is non-decreasing continuous function on the unit interval $\\mathcal{U}_{(0,1)}$. Define $\\psi(x) = x + \\phi(x)$, which is an increasing continuous function $\\psi: [0,1] \\to [0,2]$, and hence for every $y \\in [0,2]$, there exists a unique $x \\in [0,1]$, such that $y = \\psi(x)$. Thus $\\psi$ and $\\psi^{-1}$ maps Borel sets into Borel sets. Now choose a non Borel subset $S \\subseteq \\psi(C)$. Its preimage $\\psi^{-1}(S)$ must be Lebesgue measurable, as a subset of Cantor set, but it is not Borel measurable, as a topological mapping of a non-Borel subset.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let's try to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question provided. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor, so I need to make sure I understand the question thoroughly before formatting it correctly.\n\nFirst, the original problem is about finding a Lebesgue measurable set that isn't Borel measurable. The user mentions an exact duplicate and asks for a translation and expansion of Miguel's answer with a formal proof. They're stuck and need clarification, particularly on how adding a Lebesgue null set to a Borel set can result in a non-Borel set. They question what kind of null set would have this property.\n\nNow, applying the required format. The task is to list assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object, then state the problem.\n\nLooking at the example given, the assumptions are about the variable n being an integer and divisible by 7. So for this problem, the assumptions would relate to the properties of the sets involved.\n\nThe problem here is to show the existence of a Lebesgue measurable set that's not Borel measurable. The key points are the definitions: a Lebesgue measurable set that isn't in the Borel sigma-algebra. The common example involves using a measure-zero set, but the user is confused about how such a set can make the result non-Borel.\n\nAssumptions might include:\n- There exists a Lebesgue measurable set that is not Borel measurable.\n- The Lebesgue measure is complete, meaning subsets of measure zero sets are measurable.\n- The Borel sigma-algebra is generated by open sets.\n- There exists a measure-zero set that is not Borel.\n\nBut the problem statement itself is asking to prove the existence, so the assumptions are more about the conditions under which such a set exists. Wait, maybe the problem is more direct. The user is asking for a proof that such a set exists, so the assumptions would be the properties needed for the construction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem doesn't have explicit numerical assumptions but relies on set theory and measure theory concepts. However, the example given included assumptions even when the original problem didn't mention them (like n divisible by 7 in the example). Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that might be a mistake? Wait, looking back, the example's original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. That seems conflicting because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an extra condition. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Hmm. But regardless, the task is to follow the format given by the user, even if the example seems off.\n\nWait, perhaps in the example, the user intended to structure a different problem where n is divisible by 7, but the original problem was for every integer n. That might be an error. But regardless, the instruction is to structure the given problem (the Lebesgue\/Borel one) into the format with Assumptions and Problem.\n\nSo, for the current problem: \"Is there a Lebesgue measurable set that is not Borel measurable?\" The answer is yes, and the usual example involves constructing a Lebesgue measurable set by adding a subset of a measure zero set (like the Cantor set) that isn't Borel. But the assumptions would relate to the properties needed. For example, the existence of a non-Borel subset of a measure zero set, which relies on the fact that the Lebesgue measure is complete, and the Borel sigma-algebra is strictly smaller than the Lebesgue sigma-algebra.\n\nSo, listing the assumptions:\n\n- The Lebesgue measure is complete.\n- There exists a Lebesgue measure zero set with cardinality of the continuum.\n- Every subset of a Lebesgue measure zero set is Lebesgue measurable.\n- The Borel sigma-algebra has cardinality equal to the continuum.\n- There exist subsets of a measure zero set that are not Borel measurable.\n\nBut each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe Lebesgue measure is complete.\nThere exists a Lebesgue measurable set of measure zero with cardinality of the continuum.\nSubsets of Lebesgue measure zero sets are Lebesgue measurable.\nThe Borel sigma-algebra is strictly smaller than the Lebesgue sigma-algebra.\n\nBut maybe breaking it down into more atomic points:\n\nAssumption:\nThe Lebesgue measure extends the Borel measure.\nThe Lebesgue measure is complete.\nThere exists a measure zero uncountable set (e.g., Cantor set).\nSome subsets of the Cantor set are not Borel measurable.\nThe cardinality of the Borel sigma-algebra is the same as the continuum.\nThe power set of the Cantor set has cardinality greater than the continuum.\n\nWait, but some of these are more about the proof steps rather than assumptions of the problem. The original problem is to show existence, so the assumptions would be the necessary conditions under which such a set exists. However, in the example provided, the user added an assumption (n divisible by 7) even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". Maybe the example was incorrect, but the user wants the current problem structured similarly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem doesn't require explicit assumptions beyond the standard ones in measure theory. But the example included assumptions even if they were part of the problem statement. Maybe the user wants to extract implicit assumptions from the problem. For instance, the problem is to show that there exists a Lebesgue measurable set not Borel. The assumptions would be the definitions: Lebesgue measurable, Borel measurable, etc.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7, which might have been part of the problem's conditions, but in the original problem, it was stated as \"for every integer n\", which doesn't restrict n. Hmm, perhaps the example has an error, but the user still wants the current problem structured with assumptions. Since the user's example included assumptions even when the problem didn't state them, maybe here we need to list the necessary assumptions for the problem to hold.\n\nBut the problem itself is a standard result in measure theory, so the assumptions are the standard ZFC axioms, the definitions of Lebesgue and Borel sigma-algebras, and the existence of non-Borel Lebesgue measurable sets. However, translating this into the format:\n\nAssumption:\nThe Lebesgue measure is defined as the completion of the Borel measure.\nThere exist subsets of Lebesgue measure zero sets that are not Borel measurable.\nThe cardinality of the Borel sigma-algebra is strictly less than the power set of the real numbers.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a Lebesgue measurable set that is not Borel measurable.\n\nBut each assumption should be one line, each addressing one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe Lebesgue measure is the completion of the Borel measure.\nThere exists a Lebesgue measure zero set with uncountably many subsets.\nNot every subset of a Lebesgue measure zero set is Borel measurable.\nThe Borel sigma-algebra has cardinality continuum.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a Lebesgue measurable set that is not Borel measurable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe more precise:\n\nAssumption:\nLebesgue measurable sets form the completion of the Borel sigma-algebra.\nThere exists a non-Borel measurable subset of a Lebesgue measure zero set.\nThe Cantor set is uncountable and has Lebesgue measure zero.\nThe power set of the Cantor set has cardinality greater than the continuum.\n\nBut each assumption must be a single property applied to one object. Let me think again.\n\nThe key steps are:\n\n1. The Lebesgue measure is complete, so all subsets of measure zero sets are measurable.\n2. There exists a measure zero uncountable set (like the Cantor set).\n3. The Cantor set has 2^continuum subsets, but the Borel sigma-algebra has only continuum many sets.\n4. Therefore, some subsets of the Cantor set are not Borel.\n5. Adding such a subset to a Borel set can make it non-Borel but still Lebesgue measurable.\n\nSo assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe Lebesgue measure is complete.\nThe Cantor set has Lebesgue measure zero.\nThe Cantor set has cardinality of the continuum.\nThe Borel sigma-algebra has cardinality of the continuum.\nThere exist subsets of the Cantor set that are not Borel measurable.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a Lebesgue measurable set that is not Borel measurable.\n\nBut each assumption is one line, addressing one property. That seems to fit. So translating the problem into the required format, listing each necessary assumption line by line, then the problem statement.",

The Lebesgue measure is complete.\n2. The Cantor set C is a Lebesgue measurable set with measure zero.\n3. The Cantor set has cardinality equal to the continuum (|C| = c).\n4. The Borel σ-algebra has cardinality equal to the continuum.\n5. There exist subsets of the Cantor set that are not Borel measurable.\n\n**Proof:**\n\n1. **Properties of the Cantor set:** By Assumption 2, the Cantor set C is Lebesgue measurable and has Lebesgue measure zero: μ(C) = 0.\n\n2. **Completeness of Lebesgue measure:** By Assumption 1, the Lebesgue measure is complete. A key consequence of completeness is that every subset of a set of measure zero is Lebesgue measurable. Formally, if A ⊆ B and μ(B) = 0, then A is Lebesgue measurable and μ(A) = 0.\n\n3. **Cardinality considerations:** By Assumption 3, the Cantor set C has cardinality equal to the continuum: |C| = c. By Assumption 4, the Borel σ-algebra B(ℝ) has cardinality equal to the continuum: |B(ℝ)| = c.\n\n   However, the power set of C, denoted P(C), has cardinality 2^|C| = 2^c. Since 2^c > c (by Cantor's theorem), there are strictly more subsets of C than there are Borel sets. Therefore, most subsets of C are not Borel measurable.\n\n4. **Existence of non-Borel subsets of C:** By Assumption 5, there exist subsets of the Cantor set that are not Borel measurable. Let E be such a subset: E ⊆ C and E ∉ B(ℝ).\n\n5. **Lebesgue measurability of E:** Since E ⊆ C and μ(C) = 0, by the completeness of Lebesgue measure (Step 2), E is Lebesgue measurable. Moreover, μ(E) = 0 because E is a subset of a null set.\n\n6. **Non-Borel property of E:** By construction (Step 4), E is not a Borel set: E ∉ B(ℝ).\n\n7. **Conclusion:** The set E has the following properties:\n   - E is Lebesgue measurable (by Step 5).\n   - E is not Borel measurable (by Step 6).\n\nTherefore, we have constructed a set E that is Lebesgue measurable but not Borel measurable, proving the existence of such sets.\n\n**Additional remarks:** The proof relies crucially on the completeness of Lebesgue measure and the existence of non-Borel subsets of the Cantor set. The Cantor set serves as a convenient null set with continuum cardinality, allowing us to exploit the cardinality difference between the power set of C (size 2^c) and the Borel σ-algebra (size c). The assumption that such non-Borel subsets exist (Assumption 5) is justified by this cardinality argument: since there are more subsets of C than Borel sets, there must be subsets of C that are not Borel measurable.",
