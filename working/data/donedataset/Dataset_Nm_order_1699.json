    "Content": "I found this exercise in Cohn's Measure Theory : Let $(X, \\mathscr A, \\mu)$ be a finite measure space. Show that the conditions the map $T: L^1(X, \\mathscr A, \\mu) \\to (L^\\infty(X, \\mathscr A, \\mu))^\\ast$ given by $g\\mapsto T_g(f) = \\int fg \\, d\\mu$ is surjective $L^1(X, \\mathscr A, \\mu)$ is finite-dimensional $L^\\infty(X, \\mathscr A, \\mu)$ is finite-dimensional there is a finite $\\sigma$ -algebra $\\mathscr A_0$ on $X$ such that $\\mathscr A_0\\subset \\mathscr A$ and such that each set in $\\mathscr A$ differs from a set in $\\mathscr A_0$ by a $\\mu$ -null set are equivalent. I figured out a way to show $2. \\implies 4. \\implies 3. \\implies 2.$ and how these three conditions imply $1.$ What I'm having trouble with is how to get from 1. to either of the other three. If someone could provide a hint, I'd be grateful. Thank you.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Thanks to t.b.'s hint in the comments, I think I can prove $1. \\implies 4.$ now. Suppose 4. is not true for $(X, \\mathscr A, \\mu)$. Then there exists a sequence $B_n$ in $\\mathscr A$ of pairwise disjoint sets with positive measure. Now choose a point $b_n \\in B_n$ for each $n$ and let $$C = \\{f\\in L^\\infty(X, \\mathscr A, \\mu) \\mid f \\text{ is constant on $B_n$ for all $ n$ and } \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} f(b_n) \\text{ exists}\\}$$ Let $\\Lambda_0$ be the linear functional on $C$ given by $$\\Lambda_0(f) = \\lim_{n\\to \\infty} f(b_n)$$ Then $\\Lambda_0$ is continuous on $C$ (in fact $\\Vert \\Lambda_0 \\Vert = 1$) and we can extend $\\Lambda_0$ to a linear functional $\\Lambda$ on all of $L^\\infty(X, \\mathscr A, \\mu)$ by an application of Hahn-Banach. But this $\\Lambda$ cannot be of the form $$\\Lambda(f) = \\int_X fg \\, d\\mu$$ for any $g\\in L^1(X, \\mathscr A, \\mu)$. Suppose there was such $g$. Let $A_n = \\bigcup_{k=1}^n B_k$ and $A  = \\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty B_n$. Then we would have $$\\int_X  \\chi_{A_n} g \\, d\\mu = \\Lambda\\left(\\chi_{A_n}\\right) = \\lim_{m\\to\\infty} \\chi_{A_n}(b_m) =  0$$\nfor all $n$. And therefore, by the monotone convergence theorem applied to $\\chi_{A_n} g^+ \\uparrow \\chi_A g^+$ and $\\chi_{A_n} g^- \\uparrow \\chi_A g^-$, we obtain \\begin{align}\n\\int_X \\chi_A g\\, d\\mu &= \\int_X \\chi_{A} g^+\\,  d\\mu - \\int_X \\chi_{A} g^-\\, d\\mu \\\\\\\n&=  \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\int_X \\chi_{A_n} g^+\\, d\\mu - \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\int_X \\chi_{A_n} g^- \\, d\\mu \\\\\\\n&= \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\int_X \\chi_{A_n} g\\, d\\mu \\\\\n&= 0\n\\end{align} But on the other hand we have $\\Lambda(\\chi_A) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\chi_A(b_n) = 1$, a contradiction. So this $\\Lambda \\in (L^\\infty(X, \\mathscr A, \\mu))^\\ast$ is not in the image of $T: L^1(X, \\mathscr A, \\mu)\\to (L^\\infty(X, \\mathscr A, \\mu))^\\ast$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to parse the original question and extract the necessary information.\n\nThe original question is about proving the equivalence of four conditions related to measure theory. The user has already figured out some implications but is stuck on showing that condition 1 implies any of the others. However, for formatting, I need to focus on the problem statement and its assumptions, filtering out the user's progress and request for hints.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the key is to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. The problem statement should then be presented clearly.\n\nThe problem here involves a finite measure space (X, A, μ). The four conditions are about the surjectivity of a specific map, finite-dimensionality of L^1 and L^∞, and the existence of a finite σ-algebra. The user needs to structure this into the Assumption and Problem sections.\n\nAssumptions would include:\n1. (X, A, μ) is a finite measure space.\n2. T: L^1 → (L^∞)* defined by T_g(f) = ∫fg dμ.\n3. T is surjective.\n4. L^1 is finite-dimensional.\n5. L^∞ is finite-dimensional.\n6. There exists a finite σ-algebra A₀ ⊂ A such that each set in A differs from a set in A₀ by a μ-null set.\n\nBut in the example, assumptions are listed as individual conditions, each on a separate line. So each of these conditions (1-4, etc.) would be separate assumptions. However, the problem is to show the equivalence of these four conditions. Wait, the original problem states that the four conditions are equivalent. The user is supposed to structure the problem by listing the assumptions and the problem to prove equivalence.\n\nWait, in the example, the assumption was the conditions given (like n is an integer, etc.), and the problem was to prove divisibility. Here, the problem is to show that these four conditions are equivalent. So the assumptions are the given conditions, but actually, the problem is to show their equivalence under the finite measure space.\n\nWait, maybe the main assumption is that (X, A, μ) is a finite measure space. Then the problem is to show the equivalence of the four conditions. So the Assumption section should list the setup: the finite measure space, and the definitions of the conditions. But according to the example, each assumption is a single property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- (X, A, μ) is a finite measure space.\n- T: L^1(X, A, μ) → (L^∞(X, A, μ))^* is defined by T_g(f) = ∫fg dμ.\n- The four conditions (1 to 4) are as given.\n\nBut the problem is to show that these four conditions are equivalent. However, in the example, the assumption included specific conditions (like n is integer, n divisible by 7) and the problem was to prove divisibility. Here, the main assumption is the finite measure space, and the problem is to prove equivalence of the four conditions.\n\nWait, the original problem states: \"Show that the conditions [...] are equivalent.\" So the problem is to show equivalence under the assumption that (X, A, μ) is a finite measure space. Therefore, the Assumption section should list the finite measure space as the main assumption, and the problem is to show the equivalence of the four conditions.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions included both the integer n and that it's divisible by 7, but in the formatted problem, the divisibility by 7 was not in the original problem's assumption. Wait, looking back: the original problem in the example was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But in the formatted problem, the assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, the original example problem was:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n+2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut wait, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted assumption, they added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Wait, perhaps the example was incorrect? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7, which contradicts. Maybe the example was from a different problem. Hmm, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. Anyway, perhaps the user's intention is to extract the given assumptions from the problem, even if they are part of the problem statement.\n\nIn the current problem, the setup is \"Let (X, A, μ) be a finite measure space. Show that the conditions [...] are equivalent.\" So the main assumption is that (X, A, μ) is a finite measure space, and the problem is to show the equivalence of the four conditions.\n\nTherefore, in the Assumption section, we list:\n\n- (X, A, μ) is a finite measure space.\n\nThen, the problem is to show that the four conditions are equivalent. However, in the example, they listed each assumption separately, even if they were part of the problem's setup. Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which is an assumption, but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So similarly, here, the main assumption is the finite measure space. The other conditions (1-4) are the ones to be shown equivalent, so they are part of the problem, not assumptions. Therefore, the Assumption should only include the given setup, not the conditions to be proven equivalent.\n\nSo the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- (X, A, μ) is a finite measure space.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the following conditions are equivalent:\n1. The map T: L^1(X, A, μ) → (L^∞(X, A, μ))^* given by g ↦ T_g(f) = ∫fg dμ is surjective.\n2. L^1(X, A, μ) is finite-dimensional.\n3. L^∞(X, A, μ) is finite-dimensional.\n4. There exists a finite σ-algebra A₀ ⊂ A such that each set in A differs from a set in A₀ by a μ-null set.\n\nBut the user's example included specific assumptions from the problem statement. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, which is correct, and then \"n is divisible by 7\", which might be a mistake. Wait, maybe the original example had a typo. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should be just \"n is an integer\". The divisibility by 7 is part of what needs to be proven (since 91=13*7, so maybe the problem requires n to be such that 7 divides A(n), but the original problem says it's for every integer n. Wait, there's inconsistency here. Probably the example is incorrect, but we have to follow the user's instruction regardless.\n\nIn any case, returning to the current problem, the main assumption is the finite measure space. The four conditions are part of what needs to be proven equivalent. Therefore, the correct formatting is:\n\nAssumption:\n- (X, A, μ) is a finite measure space.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the following conditions are equivalent:\n1. The map T: L^1 → (L^∞)^* defined by T_g(f) = ∫fg dμ is surjective.\n2. L^1(X, A, μ) is finite-dimensional.\n3. L^∞(X, A, μ) is finite-dimensional.\n4. There exists a finite σ-algebra A₀ ⊂ A such that each set in A differs from a set in A₀ by a μ-null set.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the assumptions should list all conditions that are given. However, in the original problem, the only given assumption is that (X, A, μ) is a finite measure space. The four conditions are what need to be proven equivalent. Therefore, the problem is to show their equivalence under that assumption.\n\nHence, the formatted problem should have the finite measure space as the assumption, and the problem is to show equivalence of the four conditions.",
