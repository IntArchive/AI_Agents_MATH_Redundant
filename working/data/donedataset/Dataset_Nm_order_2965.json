If $x^2+xy+y^2 =a^2$ and $x^2-xy+y^2=b^2$ simultaneously then we have to show that there are no such integers $a$ and $b$. I have tried that: Suppose $x^2+xy+y^2=a^2$ and $x^2-xy+y^2=b^2$. Then $2xy=a^2-b^2=(a+b)(a-b)$, so one of $x$ and $y$ is even, but then I am stuck.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The question amounts to showing that the elliptic curve\n$Y^2 = X^2+X+1$, $Z^2 = X^2-X+1$\nhas no rational points other than those with $X=0$ and $X=\\infty$.\nThat can be done by elementary means but requires a Fermat-style descent.\nAccording to Dickson's History of the Theory of Numbers (Volume II, Chapter XVI, bottom of page 481, reference to footnote 119 on p.480),\nthe result was proved in 1876 by Genocchi.\n[In modern language, a Weierstrass form for this curve is\n$$y^2 = x^3+x^2-24x+36 = (x-2)(x-3)(x+6),$$\nwith conductor $48$ and thus in the \"Antwerp Tables\"\n(see curve 48C ),\nwhere we find that it has Mordell-Weil group\n$({\\bf Z}/2{\\bf Z}) \\oplus ({\\bf Z}/4{\\bf Z})$.]",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. First, I need to read the original question carefully and extract the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe title says that $x^2 + xy + y^2$ and $x^2 - xy + y^2$ are not both perfect squares. The user wants to prove that they can't both be perfect squares at the same time. The problem mentions that x and y are natural numbers. \n\nIn the assumptions, I need to list each condition applied to one object. The user states that x and y are natural numbers. So that's two separate assumptions. Then, the problem is to show that both expressions can't be perfect squares. Wait, but in the example given, the assumption included the divisibility by 7. Here, the problem doesn't have any divisibility conditions, just the fact that x and y are natural numbers and that the two quadratic forms are both perfect squares. \n\nThe user also mentions that they tried assuming both are squares and derived that 2xy = (a + b)(a - b), leading to one of x or y being even. But they got stuck. However, the problem structure shouldn't include the user's attempt, just the original problem's assumptions and the problem statement. \n\nSo, the assumptions are:\n1. x is a natural number.\n2. y is a natural number.\n3. x² + xy + y² is a perfect square (a²).\n4. x² - xy + y² is a perfect square (b²).\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address only one property applied to one object. So maybe the first two assumptions are x and y being natural numbers. Then, the problem is to show that both expressions can't be perfect squares simultaneously. Wait, but in the example, the problem was stated as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" with the assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is to show that both expressions can't be perfect squares, given x and y are natural numbers. So maybe the assumptions are just that x and y are natural numbers, and the problem is to prove that x² + xy + y² and x² - xy + y² cannot both be perfect squares. But in the user's original problem statement, they mention \"surely x and y are natural numbers,\" so that's part of the problem's given conditions. \n\nTherefore, structuring it as:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a natural number,\ny is a natural number,\nx² + xy + y² is a perfect square,\nx² - xy + y² is a perfect square.\n\nProblem: Prove that x² + xy + y² and x² - xy + y² cannot both be perfect squares.\n\nWait, but according to the example, the problem statement includes the conclusion. For instance, in the example, the problem was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91,\" given the assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So maybe here, the problem is to prove that such a scenario (both expressions being squares) is impossible. So the problem statement would be: Prove that x² + xy + y² and x² - xy + y² cannot both be perfect squares, given that x and y are natural numbers. But the user's original problem already includes \"surely x and y are natural numbers,\" so we need to include that in the assumptions. \n\nSo, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a natural number,\ny is a natural number,\nx² + xy + y² is a perfect square,\nx² - xy + y² is a perfect square.\n\nProblem: Show that there are no integers a and b such that both equations hold.\n\nBut in the example, the problem was stated as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" with assumptions on n. Here, the problem is to show that there are no such a and b (i.e., that the two expressions can't both be squares). Alternatively, maybe the problem is just \"Prove that x² + xy + y² and x² - xy + y² cannot both be perfect squares,\" with assumptions that x and y are natural numbers. \n\nWait, the original problem says: \"Prove that $x^2+xy+y^2$ and $x^2-xy+y^2$ cannot be both perfect squares. Surely $x$ and $y$ are natural numbers.\" So the problem is to prove that both can't be squares, with x and y being natural numbers. So the assumptions are x and y are natural numbers, and the problem is to prove the impossibility. However, the example included the divisibility as an assumption. Here, the problem doesn't have any other assumptions besides x and y being natural numbers. Therefore, the assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a natural number,\ny is a natural number.\n\nProblem: Prove that $x^2 + xy + y^2$ and $x^2 - xy + y^2$ cannot both be perfect squares.\n\nBut in the example, they also included the divisibility of n by 7 as an assumption, even though the original problem was for every integer n. Wait, in the example, the original problem was \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems incorrect. Wait, perhaps I need to check that. The example given was:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems like a mistake. Because the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added n divisible by 7 as an assumption, which was not in the original. That might be a mistake in the example. So perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user still wants me to follow that format. Therefore, in the current problem, the user's original question says \"surely x and y are natural numbers,\" which is part of the problem's conditions. So the assumptions should include that x and y are natural numbers, and also the conditions that both expressions are perfect squares. Wait, but in the example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the assumption included n being an integer and divisible by 7. But the original problem was for every integer n. That suggests that maybe the example is not correctly formatted. But the user wants me to follow the format as in the example. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem changed it to n divisible by 7. That seems like an error, but maybe the user intended to restructure the problem with specific assumptions. So for the current problem, maybe the assumptions should include both x and y being natural numbers, and the problem statement is to show that there are no such integers a and b. Wait, the original problem says \"Prove that x²+xy+y² and x²−xy+y² cannot be both perfect squares. Surely x and y are natural numbers.\" So the problem is to prove that there are no x, y natural numbers such that both expressions are perfect squares. Therefore, the assumptions are x and y are natural numbers, and both expressions are perfect squares (i.e., there exist integers a, b such that x² + xy + y² = a² and x² - xy + y² = b²). The problem then would be to show that such a scenario is impossible, i.e., no such x, y exist. \n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were the conditions on n (integer and divisible by 7), and the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. So here, perhaps the problem is to prove that there are no integers a and b such that the two equations hold, given that x and y are natural numbers. Alternatively, the problem statement is the original one: Prove that x² + xy + y² and x² - xy + y² cannot both be perfect squares. The assumptions are that x and y are natural numbers. \n\nWait, maybe the problem statement in the formatted version should be exactly as the original problem's main question, and the assumptions are the given conditions. In the original problem, the user says \"Prove that x²+xy+y² and x²−xy+y^2 cannot be both perfect squares. Surely x and y are natural numbers.\" So the assumptions are x and y are natural numbers. The problem is to prove that both expressions can't be squares. Therefore, the formatted problem would have assumptions: x is a natural number, y is a natural number. Problem: Prove that x² + xy + y² and x² - xy + y² cannot both be perfect squares. \n\nBut the user's own example added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, the original example had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem had \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Maybe the user made an error in their example. Therefore, following the user's instruction, perhaps in their example, they restructured the problem by adding an assumption that n is divisible by 7, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". That seems inconsistent, but perhaps the user intended to show how to extract assumptions from the problem. \n\nGiven that, perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions should include the conditions given in the problem, which are x and y are natural numbers, and the problem is to show that the two expressions can't both be squares. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a natural number,\ny is a natural number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $x^2 + xy + y^2$ and $x^2 - xy + y^2$ cannot both be perfect squares.\n\nBut the user's original problem also mentions \"If x²+xy+y² =a² and x²−xy+y²=b² simultaneously then we have to show that there are no such integers a and b.\" So maybe the problem is to show that there are no integers a, b such that both equations hold, given x and y are natural numbers. Therefore, the assumptions would include that a and b are integers. Wait, but in the problem statement, the user says \"surely x and y are natural numbers,\" but doesn't mention a and b. However, the problem is to show that there are no such a and b. So the assumptions are x and y are natural numbers, and there exist integers a and b such that both equations hold. But the problem is to show that this is impossible. Therefore, the assumptions might be:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a natural number,\ny is a natural number,\nx² + xy + y² is a perfect square,\nx² - xy + y² is a perfect square.\n\nProblem: Show that there are no integers a and b such that both equations hold.\n\nBut in the example, the problem was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" with assumptions on n. Here, the problem is to show that such a and b don't exist. However, the user's original problem statement is to prove that both expressions can't be squares when x and y are natural numbers. Therefore, perhaps the problem statement is as the user wrote: \"Prove that $x^2+xy+y^2$ and $x^2−xy+y^2$ cannot be both perfect squares. Surely $x$ and $y$ are natural numbers.\" So the assumptions are x and y are natural numbers, and the problem is to prove that both expressions can't be squares. Hence, the formatted version would be:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a natural number,\ny is a natural number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $x^2 + xy + y^2$ and $x^2 - xy + y^2$ cannot both be perfect squares.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the problem requires both expressions to be perfect squares (as part of the problem's setup), then the assumptions would include that both expressions are squares. But I think the problem is to prove that even if you assume x and y are natural numbers, you can't have both expressions as squares. Therefore, the assumptions are just x and y being natural numbers, and the problem is to prove the impossibility. Therefore, the formatted version should have the assumptions as x and y being natural numbers, and the problem as proving that both expressions can't be squares. \n\nHowever, looking back at the example, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. That suggests that maybe the user's example has a mistake. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to list all given conditions as assumptions. In the current problem, the user specifies that x and y are natural numbers, and the problem is to prove that both expressions can't be squares. Therefore, the assumptions are x and y are natural numbers, and the problem is to prove the impossibility. \n\nThus, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a natural number,\ny is a natural number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $x^2 + xy + y^2$ and $x^2 - xy + y^2$ cannot both be perfect squares.\n\nThis seems correct. The user's own example might have included an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) incorrectly, but according to the current problem's instructions, the task is to filter unrelated information and structure the problem with assumptions and problem statement. Here, the key assumptions are x and y being natural numbers, and the problem is to show both expressions can't be squares. The user's mention of trying to manipulate the equations is part of their attempt, which should be omitted in the formatted problem.",
