    "Content": "I need to show that if $X$ is an uncountable Tychonoff space, then $C(X)$ is not metrizable. All I've been able to show so far is that that $F(X)$, the space of all functions with pointwise topology, is homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^X$ (the product) which is not metrizable, but I can't seem to get much further. Thanks.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Hint: If the pointwise convergence topology was metrizable, it would be first countable, so $0$ would have a countable neighbourhood base.  Thus there would be a sequence of open neighbourhoods $U_i$ of $0$ such that every neighbourhood of $0$ contains some $U_i$. By definition of the topology of pointwise convergence, for each $i$ there exist some finite set $J_i$ and some $\\epsilon_i > 0$ such that $f \\in U_i$ if $|f(x)| < \\epsilon_i$ for all $x \\in J_i$.  Now define another neighbourhood $U$ of $0$, and use the fact that $X$ is completely regular to show that for any $i$ there is some $f \\in C(X)$ such that $f \\in U_i$ but $f \\notin U$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. The user wants to show that if X is an uncountable Tychonoff space, then C(X) with the pointwise convergence topology is not metrizable. They mentioned something about F(X) being homeomorphic to ℝ^X, which isn't metrizable. Hmm, so maybe the key here is to relate C(X) to ℝ^X?\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the pointwise convergence topology is. That's the topology where a net of functions converges if and only if it converges pointwise at every point in X. So, this is the same as the product topology on ℝ^X, right? Because the product topology is also characterized by pointwise convergence.\n\nWait, the user says F(X) (all functions) with pointwise topology is homeomorphic to ℝ^X. So, C(X) is a subspace of F(X). If ℝ^X isn't metrizable, then its subspace C(X) might not be either. But wait, subspaces of non-metrizable spaces can sometimes still be metrizable. So that approach might not be sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, the user might need to show that C(X) itself, with the pointwise topology, isn't metrizable. How does one usually show a space isn't metrizable? Common ways include showing it's not first-countable, or not Hausdorff, but the product topology is Hausdorff. Alternatively, using that a metrizable space must be first-countable, so if C(X) isn't first-countable, then it's not metrizable.\n\nBut in the product topology, ℝ^X is first-countable only if X is countable. Since X is uncountable here, ℝ^X isn't first-countable, hence not metrizable. But C(X) is a subspace. If X is uncountable, then even C(X) with the pointwise topology (subspace of ℝ^X) would not be first-countable. Wait, but does being a subspace preserve first-countability? If the whole space isn't first-countable, a subspace could still be. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. The user mentions X is a Tychonoff space. Tychonoff spaces are completely regular Hausdorff spaces. The fact that X is Tychonoff might be important because C(X) separates points and closed sets, which is related to the embedding in products. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use that if C(X) is metrizable, then it must be first-countable. So, suppose for contradiction that C(X) is metrizable, hence first-countable. Then, take a countable neighborhood base at some function. But in the pointwise topology, basic open sets are determined by finite subsets of X. So, to have a countable neighborhood base, you might need X to be countable, which it's not. Wait, but how does that work?\n\nIn the product topology on ℝ^X, a basis at a point involves finite restrictions. So, for each function f in C(X), a neighborhood basis consists of sets of the form {g ∈ C(X) | |g(x_i) - f(x_i)| < ε for i = 1, ..., n}, where {x_1, ..., x_n} is a finite subset of X. If X is uncountable, then any basis would require considering infinitely many points, but in the product topology, neighborhoods only restrict finitely many coordinates. Therefore, even though X is uncountable, the neighborhood basis at any point in C(X) (with pointwise topology) is countable? Wait, no. The number of finite subsets of X is the same as the cardinality of X when X is infinite. If X is uncountable, the number of finite subsets is still uncountable. Therefore, the neighborhood basis would require uncountably many open sets, meaning that C(X) isn't first-countable. Hence, since metrizable spaces are first-countable, C(X) isn't metrizable.\n\nSo, the key assumptions here are that X is an uncountable Tychonoff space, and C(X) is equipped with the pointwise convergence topology. The problem is to show that under these conditions, C(X) is not metrizable.\n\nThe original user also mentioned that ℝ^X is not metrizable. Since C(X) is a subspace of ℝ^X, but subspaces of metrizable spaces are metrizable. However, the converse isn't true. So, if ℝ^X isn't metrizable, its subspace C(X) might not be either, but that's not a direct proof. However, the argument via first-countability applies directly to C(X) as a subspace. So, since X is uncountable, C(X) with the pointwise topology isn't first-countable, hence not metrizable.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should include that X is an uncountable Tychonoff space and that the topology on C(X) is the pointwise convergence topology. The problem is to show that under these assumptions, C(X) is not metrizable.",
