    "Content": "Artin's Algebra, Chapter 10 problem 5.16 states: Let $F$ be a field. Prove that the rings $F[x]/(x^2)$ and $F[x]/(x^2-1)$ are isomorphic if and only if $F$ has characteristic 2. As a pedantic concern: if F has characteristic 0, then surely this isomorphism still holds? So maybe it should be \"characteristic at most 2\"? More seriously, it seems like $F[x]/(x^2)=\\left\\{f_0 + f_1 x\\right\\}$ since we're just setting $x^2=0$. Similarly, it seems like $f_0 + f_1x / (x^2-1) = f_0 + f_1 x$, which implies that $F[x]/(x^2)=F[x]/(x^2-1)$ independent of the characteristic of $F$. To prove this we need to show that $\\text{deg}(fg)=\\text{deg}(f)+\\text{deg}(g)$,  which I believe is true in at least integral domains. What is my mistake here?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "No, the problem is correct as stated: in particular those rings are not isomorphic in characteristic zero.  I think your mistake is coming from reading too much into your description of the elements of both quotient rings as (being represented by) $f_0 + f_1 x$.  This shows that they are isomorphic as $F$-vector spaces: i.e., they both have dimension $2$.  But it doesn't show you that they are isomorphic as rings. Hint: if the characteristic is not $2$, then $(x-1)$ and $(x+1)$ are comaximal ideals in the polynomial ring $F[x]$, so one can apply the Chinese Remainder Theorem to get a nice description of $F[x]/(x^2-1)$.  In particular, you should find that the quotient is a reduced ring , i.e., has no nonzero nilpotent elements, unlike $F[x]/(x^2)$. I guess you can see why the two rings are isomorphic in characteristic $2$? Added : After you have solved this problem, it is enlightening to do a more general one: let $F$ be a field, $P(x) \\in F[x]$ a polynomial, and try to give as explicit a description as you can of the quotient ring $F[x]/(P(x))$.  For instance: when is it an integral domain?  A field?  A connected ring (i.e., with no idempotents other than $0$ and $1$)?  A reduced ring (i.e., with no nilpotents other than $0$)?  It turns out that everything depends upon the shape of the factorization of $P(x)$ into powers of distinct irreducible polynomials...",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So the user wants to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me first read through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe title says: \"F[x]/(x²) ≅ F[x]/(x² - 1) if and only if F has characteristic 2\". The question is from Artin's Algebra, chapter 10 problem 5.16. The user is confused because they think that if F has characteristic 0, the isomorphism should still hold, and maybe the problem should state \"characteristic at most 2\". They also mention that in both quotient rings, elements seem to be of the form f0 + f1x, making them isomorphic regardless of the characteristic. They question where their mistake is, as they thought degree properties hold in integral domains.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem. The main problem is to prove that F[x]/(x²) and F[x]/(x² -1) are isomorphic if and only if F has characteristic 2. The user's confusion points out potential issues with the characteristic not being just 2, but maybe 0 or others. However, the problem as stated in Artin's book is correct, so the user must have a misunderstanding.\n\nNow, structuring the problem into the given format. The assumptions need to be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition on one object. The problem statement is then restated.\n\nOriginal problem mentions that the isomorphism holds iff F has characteristic 2. The user's question includes their own thoughts, but the core problem is about proving the isomorphism under that condition. The key assumptions here are:\n\n1. F is a field.\n2. The rings in question are F[x]/(x²) and F[x]/(x² - 1).\n3. The characteristic of F is 2 (for the \"if\" part) and if the isomorphism holds, then the characteristic must be 2 (for the \"only if\" part).\n\nBut in the format, assumptions are the given conditions. The problem is to prove the isomorphism holds iff the characteristic is 2. So the assumptions should include that F is a field, and the problem is the equivalence between the isomorphism and characteristic 2.\n\nWait, the problem says \"prove that the rings are isomorphic if and only if F has characteristic 2\". So the assumptions would be:\n\n- F is a field.\n- Consider the rings F[x]/(x²) and F[x]/(x² - 1).\n\nBut the user is confused because they think maybe characteristic 0 would work. The actual answer is that in characteristic 2, x² -1 factors as (x-1)², so the ideal (x² -1) becomes (x-1)², which is similar to (x²), but in other characteristics, like 0 or not 2, x² -1 splits into distinct linear factors, so the quotient ring would be a product of two fields (by Chinese Remainder Theorem), hence not isomorphic to F[x]/(x²), which has nilpotent elements.\n\nSo the key assumption is that F is a field. The problem is to show the isomorphism holds iff char F is 2.\n\nSo structuring the problem:\n\nAssumption: F is a field.\n\nProblem: Prove that the rings F[x]/(x²) and F[x]/(x² - 1) are isomorphic if and only if F has characteristic 2.\n\nBut wait, the original problem mentions \"if and only if F has characteristic 2\", so the assumptions should include that we are considering both directions. However, the format requires listing all assumptions. The problem is the statement to prove. So perhaps the only assumption is that F is a field. The rest is part of the problem statement.\n\nIn the example given earlier, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but in the problem, they corrected that. Wait, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. Wait, that seems like a mistake. Wait no, in the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem changed it to assume n is divisible by 7. Wait, that example might be incorrect. But perhaps that's a different scenario. Let me check.\n\nOriginal problem example: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems like the user modified the problem, perhaps incorrectly. But in this case, the correct problem is that the original question says \"for every integer n\", which requires no assumption on n except being an integer. But the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which changes the problem. That might be a mistake in the example. However, the user is providing that example as a guideline.\n\nBut perhaps in the current problem, the user wants to structure the problem as per the original problem's actual statement. The original problem says \"Prove that the rings [...] are isomorphic if and only if F has characteristic 2\". So the assumptions are that F is a field. The problem is the equivalence with characteristic 2.\n\nSo the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption: F is a field.\n\nProblem: Prove that the rings F[x]/(x²) and F[x]/(x² - 1) are isomorphic if and only if F has characteristic 2.\n\nBut the user also mentions their confusion about characteristic 0. However, according to the problem's correct answer, in characteristic 2, x² -1 = x² +1 = (x+1)^2, so the quotient F[x]/(x² -1) is similar to F[x]/(x²), which has a nilpotent element. In other characteristics, like characteristic not 2, x² -1 factors into (x-1)(x+1), distinct factors, so the quotient ring is isomorphic to F×F, which is a product of fields, hence has no nilpotents, unlike F[x]/(x²) which has x as a nilpotent element. Hence, they can't be isomorphic unless the characteristic is 2.\n\nSo the problem as stated is correct. The user's confusion comes from thinking that both rings have elements of the form f0 + f1x, but the ring structures differ based on multiplication rules. In characteristic 2, (x+1)^2 = x² + 2x +1 = x² +1, but if char F=2, then 2x=0, so x² -1 = (x-1)^2, hence similar to x²=0. So in that case, the quotient rings are both local rings with nilpotent elements. In other characteristics, the rings are not isomorphic because one has nilpotents and the other doesn't.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list F as a field, and the problem is the isomorphism iff char F=2.",
