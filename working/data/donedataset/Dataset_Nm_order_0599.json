    "Content": "A function $f(x)$ on $[0,1]$ is said to satisfy a Lipschitz condition if there exists a constant $M$, such that $$|f(x)-f(y)|\\leqslant M|x-y| ~\\forall~x,y\\in[0,1].\n$$ I want to show the following: If $f$ is Lipschitz, then (i) $f$ is absolutely continuous (ii) $f$ is of bounded variation. (iii) $f'(x)$ exists almost everywhere on $[0,1]$ and $f(x)=\\int_0^x f'(t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t$, provided that $f(0)=0$. Attempt: (i) Let $\\varepsilon \\gt 0$. Choose $\\delta=\\varepsilon /M$. Then for any collection $\\{[x_i,y_i]\\}$ of non-overlapping intervals with total length $\\sum |x_i-y_i|\\lt \\delta$, we have $$\\sum|f(x_i)-f(y_i)|\\lt M\\sum|x_i-y_i|\\lt \\varepsilon.$$ Hence $f$ is absolutely continuous. (ii) For this, can I simply use the fact that an absolutely continuous functions is of bounded variation or I would have to prove it formally? (iii) I also know that if $f$ absolutely continuous $\\implies$ $f$ is of bounded variation $\\implies f'(x)$ exists a.e. and $$ f(x)=f(0)+\\int_0^x f'(t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t. $$ Thus, $f(x)=\\int_0^x f'(t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t \\text{ if } f(0)=0.$ Can I use these known facts to prove (ii) and (iii)? I am also asked to find a function $h(x)$ on $[0,1]$ such that $$\\tag{​*​}\\int_0^1 h'(x)\\text{d}x\\lt h(1)-h(0).$$ This is  what I did:  Let $h$ be the Cantor function is monotone increasing of $[0,1]$. $h(0)=1,~h(1)=1$. $h'=0,~\\forall~x$ not in the Cantor set. Then the inequality holds. Are there other examples where (*) holds?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "As was pointed out in the comments, your argument for (i) is perfectly fine. Concerning (ii), yes, that's true, you could apply that result. On the other hand, the direct proof is straightforward: We want to prove that\n$$\\tag{#}\n\\sup{\n  \\left\\{\n    \\sum_{k=1}^n |f(a_k) - f(a_{k-1})|\n     \\,:\\,\n     0\\leq a_0 \\leq a_1 \\leq \\cdots \\leq a_{n-1} \\leq a_n \\leq 1\n    \\right\\}\n} \\lt \\infty\n$$\nwhere the supremum is taken over all finite increasing sequences in $[0,1]$. Finiteness follows from the Lipschitz condition $|f(x) - f(y)| \\leq M\\cdot|x-y|$ because for a finite increasing sequence $0\\leq a_0 \\leq a_1 \\leq \\cdots \\leq a_{n-1} \\leq a_n \\leq 1$ we have\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^n |f(a_k) - f(a_{k-1})| \\leq \\sum_{k=1}^n\\phantom{|} M \\cdot |a_k - a_{k-1}| \\leq M\n$$\nbecause $|a_k-a_{k-1}| = a_{k}-a_{k-1}$ and $\\sum_{k=1}^n (a_k-a_{k-1}) = a_n -a_0 \\leq 1 - 0 = 1$. This proves that the supremum in $(\\#)$ is in fact bounded by $M \\lt \\infty$. This seems a bit easier than making the detour via absolute continuity (you'll notice that I hardly did anything else than what you did in your proof for (i), and that's why I gave the fully detailed argument). Compare this with the proof of the fact that absolute continuity of a function $f$ implies that it is of bounded variation (which isn't much more difficult, but somewhat more fiddly, I think). Now for (iii) I don't think that it is intended that you do this by hand, as a direct and detailed proof of this involves a considerable amount of work. So what you do is almost certainly the intention of this exercise. Be a little careful, though: you say I also know that if $f$ absolutely continuous $\\implies$ $f$ is f bounded variation $\\implies f'(x)$ exists a.e. and $$ f(x)=f(0)+\\int_0^1 f'(x)\\text{d}x. $$ Thus, $f(x)=\\int_0^1 f'(x)\\text{d}x~~~\\text{if}~~f(0)=0.$ The second implication you write here is not true: bounded variation alone doesn't give that $f(x) = f(0) + \\int_{0}^x f'(t)\\,dt$ — note that there are two typos here as well: the upper bound of the integral should be $x$ instead of $1$ and your equality $f(x) = f(0) + \\int_{0}^1 f'(x)\\,dx$ involves $x$ with two different meanings: on the left hand side you have some point $x \\in [0,1]$ and on the right hand side you have $x$ as a “dummy variable” for integration. To see that the implication that bounded variation of $f$ doesn't imply that $f(x) = f(0) + \\int_{0}^x f'(t)\\,dt$, just notice that the Cantor function $h$ is monotone, hence of bounded variation, but $\\int_{0}^x h(t)\\,dt = 0$ for all $x \\in [0,1]$. However, I think that you meant to say that $f$ absolutely continuous implies $f(x) = f(0) + \\int_{0}^x f(t)\\,dt$ without interrupting by \"$f$ has bounded variation\", and then the rest of the argument here is fine too. To get other (trivial examples) for your last question you can of course take any continuously differentiable (or even only absolutely continuous) function $g$ and add $h$ to it. Genuine examples not involving the Cantor function or simple variations of it are a bit cumbersome to come up with, so I think you solved that exercise satisfactorily, too. When looking up something else, I recently found this nice and careful write-up by Noella Grady, which is about the present and many related matters.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to parse the original question carefully. \n\nThe original title is \"On Lipschitz condition and absolute continuity.\" The main question is to show three things if a function f is Lipschitz: (i) f is absolutely continuous, (ii) f is of bounded variation, (iii) f'(x) exists almost everywhere and can be expressed as an integral, given f(0)=0. Then there's a separate part asking for an example function h where the integral of h’ is less than h(1) - h(0).\n\nFirst, the assumptions. The function f is defined on [0,1]. It satisfies a Lipschitz condition, which means there's a constant M such that |f(x)-f(y)| ≤ M|x-y| for all x,y in [0,1]. Additionally, for part (iii), there's a provided condition that f(0)=0. However, in the problem statements (i)-(iii), only (iii) has the f(0)=0 condition. The other parts (i) and (ii) don't require f(0)=0, so that's specific to part (iii). But the problem as presented in the user's example might combine all three into one problem statement. Wait, looking back, the original problem lists three parts: (i), (ii), (iii). So each part may have different assumptions. But in the format, the Assumption section should list all assumptions applicable to the problem. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example given, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. The user formatted the assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, but in the original problem statement, the user had \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, that might not be correct. Wait, the original problem was \"for every integer n\", the number A(n) is divisible by 91. But 91 is 7*13. So maybe the correct assumption should be that n is an integer, but the user included \"n is divisible by 7\", which was not in the original. Hmm, perhaps there was an error there. But regardless, in the current problem, the user wants to structure the problem from the given Math Stack Exchange question.\n\nSo, the problem here is to show three properties (i)-(iii) given that f is Lipschitz. The assumptions are: f is defined on [0,1], f satisfies Lipschitz condition (i.e., there exists M such that |f(x)-f(y)| ≤ M|x-y| for all x,y in [0,1]). Additionally, for part (iii), there is the provided condition f(0)=0.\n\nBut in the problem statement, part (iii) includes \"provided that f(0)=0\". So in the overall problem, part (iii) has an additional assumption. However, in the formatted problem, should we include all assumptions applicable to each part? Or is the problem presented as three separate sub-problems under the main problem? The user's example had the problem as a single statement with all assumptions listed. So perhaps here, since all parts (i)-(iii) are under the same problem, the assumptions should include all the general ones, and any specific ones for each part. But how to structure that?\n\nLooking at the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption includes \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7; that might have been an error. Let me check the example again. Original problem: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\" Then in the formatted problem, assumptions are \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But that's incorrect because the problem says \"for every integer n\", so n doesn't need to be divisible by 7. The correct assumptions should only be \"n is an integer\". The user might have made a mistake there.\n\nBut perhaps in the original example, there was a misunderstanding. Anyway, focusing back on the current problem. The main problem is to show (i)-(iii) given f is Lipschitz. The key assumptions are:\n\n1. f is defined on the interval [0,1].\n2. f satisfies the Lipschitz condition: there exists a constant M such that |f(x) - f(y)| ≤ M|x - y| for all x, y ∈ [0,1].\n3. For part (iii), there's an additional condition that f(0) = 0.\n\nBut the problem is presented as three parts under one main problem. So how to structure this? The problem mentions \"If f is Lipschitz, then (i)... (ii)... (iii)...\" with the condition for (iii) given. So in the overall problem statement, part (iii) has an extra condition. Therefore, the assumptions should include all the general ones (1 and 2), and the specific one for part (iii) (3). However, in the format, the Assumption section lists all assumptions, each addressing one property applied to one object.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\n- f is a function defined on [0,1],\n- f satisfies the Lipschitz condition with constant M,\n- For part (iii), f(0) = 0.\n\nBut the problem is presented as a single problem with three parts. So should the Assumption include the f(0)=0 even though it's only for part (iii)? Or is it considered part of the problem statement for (iii)? The user's example included an assumption that was not in the original problem (n divisible by 7), which might have been incorrect. So perhaps in this case, the main problem is \"If f is Lipschitz, then (i)... (ii)... (iii)...\" with (iii) having the extra condition. Therefore, the general assumptions are that f is Lipschitz on [0,1], and for (iii), additionally f(0)=0. So in the Assumption section, we need to list:\n\n- f is defined on [0,1],\n- f satisfies the Lipschitz condition (i.e., exists M>0 such that |f(x)-f(y)| ≤ M|x-y| for all x,y in [0,1]),\n- For part (iii), f(0)=0.\n\nBut how to phrase \"for part (iii)\" in the assumption? The example given by the user didn't have parts, so maybe the assumptions are all the general ones, and the problem includes the specific conditions. Alternatively, since (iii) has an extra condition, that should be stated in the problem. But according to the example, the problem statement included \"provided that f(0)=0\" in the problem. Let me check the original problem:\n\nOriginal problem statement:\n\"If f is Lipschitz, then (i) f is absolutely continuous (ii) f is of bounded variation. (iii) f'(x) exists almost everywhere on [0,1] and f(x)=∫₀ˣ f'(t)dt, provided that f(0)=0.\"\n\nSo part (iii) has the condition \"provided that f(0)=0\". Therefore, the main assumptions are:\n\n1. f is defined on [0,1].\n2. f satisfies Lipschitz condition (there exists M such that |f(x)-f(y)| ≤ M|x-y| for all x,y in [0,1]).\n\nThen, in part (iii), there is an additional condition f(0)=0. So in the formatted problem, the assumptions should include the general ones (1 and 2), and the problem statement for (iii) includes the provided condition. However, the user's example included the extra assumption (n divisible by 7) even though it wasn't in the original problem's general statement. That suggests that perhaps in the formatted problem, all assumptions (both general and specific) are listed. But in this case, the specific condition for (iii) is part of the problem statement. Therefore, the correct way is:\n\nAssumption:\n- f is a function defined on the interval [0,1],\n- f satisfies the Lipschitz condition with constant M,\n- f(0) = 0.\n\nBut wait, the f(0)=0 is only for part (iii). But the problem as a whole has three parts. Therefore, perhaps the assumption should list all possible assumptions, including those specific to certain parts. Alternatively, since (iii) is part of the same problem, maybe the Assumption section includes all assumptions, even if they are only relevant to a subpart. Alternatively, the user might have intended to separate the problem into different parts. But according to the example, the formatted problem combines all parts into one problem statement. Let's look at the example:\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem lists assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\", and the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. But that's incorrect because the original problem didn't require n to be divisible by 7. This suggests that maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Therefore, when structuring the current problem, I need to be careful.\n\nGiven that, the original problem here has three parts under one main problem. The general assumption is that f is Lipschitz on [0,1]. For part (iii), there's an additional condition f(0)=0. Therefore, the Assumption section should include the general assumptions for all parts and the specific assumption for part (iii). But how to represent that. Since the format requires all assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- f is a function defined on [0,1],\n- f satisfies the Lipschitz condition with constant M,\n- For part (iii), f(0) = 0.\n\nBut the original problem's part (iii) states \"provided that f(0)=0\", which is part of the problem statement for (iii). Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumptions should include the general conditions (f is Lipschitz on [0,1]), and the problem statement for (iii) includes the provided condition. However, according to the user's example, the additional condition (like n divisible by 7) was included in the assumptions even though it was not part of the original problem's general statement. Therefore, in this case, the user might want to include all conditions, even those specific to a part, in the Assumption section. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to structure each part separately. But the example combines everything into one problem.\n\nThe original problem as presented by the user includes three parts (i)-(iii) under one main problem. The user also included another part about finding a function h(x) where the integral of h’ is less than h(1)-h(0). So this is a separate problem, but in the same question. The user's example only had one problem, but here there are two: showing (i)-(iii) for Lipschitz f, and finding an example h(x) satisfying (*).\n\nWait, looking back at the original question: the user wrote:\n\n\"I am also asked to find a function h(x) on [0,1] such that ∫₀¹ h’(x)dx < h(1)-h(0). This is what I did: Let h be the Cantor function... Are there other examples where (*) holds?\"\n\nSo there are two separate problems here:\n\n1. Show that if f is Lipschitz, then (i)-(iii).\n2. Find a function h satisfying (*).\n\nBut in the original question, both are part of the same post. However, the user's example only formatted one problem. So perhaps the user wants to split them into two separate formatted problems. But the user's instruction says: \"structure that problem as the following format\" given the example. The example was one problem. So perhaps each problem in the original post should be formatted separately. Let me check.\n\nOriginal post's first part: proving (i)-(iii) for Lipschitz f. Second part: finding h such that ∫... < ... So these are two separate problems. Therefore, each should be formatted separately. However, the user's instruction says \"the problem\" (singular) on Math Stack Exchange. But the original post has multiple problems. However, the user provided an example with a single problem. So perhaps the user wants each problem in the original post to be formatted individually. Let me confirm.\n\nThe original post's title is \"On Lipschitz condition and absolute continuity\". The main problem is to show (i)-(iii) for Lipschitz functions. Then there's a separate problem: find h such that ∫h’ < h(1)-h(0). The user's example had a single problem. Therefore, the assistant should structure each problem separately. However, the user hasn't specified whether to separate them. But given the example, which is one problem, perhaps each problem should be formatted individually.\n\nFirst problem:\n\nAssumption:\n- f is a function defined on [0,1],\n- f satisfies the Lipschitz condition with constant M.\n\nProblem:\nProve that:\n(i) f is absolutely continuous,\n(ii) f is of bounded variation,\n(iii) f'(x) exists almost everywhere on [0,1] and f(x)=∫₀ˣ f'(t)dt, provided that f(0)=0.\n\nSecond problem:\n\nAssumption:\n- h is a function defined on [0,1].\n\nProblem:\nFind a function h such that ∫₀¹ h’(x)dx < h(1) - h(0).\n\nBut in the original problem, the user's attempt for the second part uses the Cantor function, which is a standard example. However, the problem is to find examples where (*) holds, so it's asking for functions h where the integral of h’ is less than the difference h(1)-h(0). Therefore, the assumption here is that h is a function on [0,1], and the problem is to find such h. But the example given by the user (Cantor function) has h’=0 a.e., so ∫h’=0 < h(1)-h(0) because h(1)=1 and h(0)=0, but wait, the Cantor function maps 0 to 0 and 1 to 1, so h(1)-h(0)=1-0=1, and ∫h’=0, so 0<1. Correct. However, in the user's attempt, they wrote h(0)=1 and h(1)=1, which is incorrect for the Cantor function. The Cantor function starts at 0 and ends at 1. So that's a mistake in the user's attempt. But that's besides the point.\n\nSo for the second problem:\n\nAssumption:\n- h is a function defined on [0,1].\n\nProblem:\nFind a function h such that ∫₀¹ h’(x)dx < h(1) - h(0).\n\nBut in the original problem, the user is also asking if there are other examples besides the Cantor function. However, the structured problem should capture the main problem: finding such a function h. Therefore, the problem is to find a function h on [0,1] satisfying the inequality. The assumptions would be that h is defined on [0,1], but possibly more. However, the standard example is the Cantor function, which is singular (continuous, increasing, derivative zero a.e.), so the integral of h’ is 0, which is less than h(1)-h(0)=1. Therefore, the assumption for h is that it's defined on [0,1], but there's no need for Lipschitz or other conditions because the problem is to find any such h.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is to find h where h is differentiable a.e. and the integral of h’ exists (as Lebesgue integral) but is less than h(1)-h(0). So the assumptions would be:\n\n- h is defined on [0,1],\n- h is differentiable almost everywhere on [0,1],\n- h’ is Lebesgue integrable on [0,1].\n\nBut these are part of the problem's context. However, in the original question, the user didn't specify these; they just asked for a function h where the inequality holds. So perhaps the assumption is simply h is a function on [0,1], and the problem is to find such h where ∫₀¹ h’(x)dx < h(1)-h(0).\n\nBut in the answer, the user used the Cantor function, which is not differentiable everywhere, but differentiable a.e. with derivative 0 a.e. So the integral of h’ is 0, which is less than 1 (h(1)-h(0)). Thus, the problem is to find such functions, and the example is the Cantor function. The user is asking for other examples.\n\nBut according to the format, the problem should capture the main question. So the second problem is:\n\nAssumption:\n- h is a function defined on [0,1].\n\nProblem:\nFind a function h such that ∫₀¹ h’(x)dx < h(1) - h(0).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps h needs to be differentiable a.e. and h’ integrable. But since the user is using the Cantor function, which satisfies these, the assumptions may include that h is differentiable a.e. and h’ is integrable, but the original problem doesn't specify. It just says \"find a function h(x) on [0,1]\".\n\nGiven the ambiguity, perhaps it's safest to list the minimal assumptions:\n\nFor the first problem (i)-(iii):\n\nAssumption:\n- f is a function defined on [0,1],\n- f satisfies the Lipschitz condition (i.e., there exists M > 0 such that |f(x) - f(y)| ≤ M|x - y| for all x, y ∈ [0,1]),\n- For part (iii), f(0) = 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that:\n(i) f is absolutely continuous,\n(ii) f is of bounded variation,\n(iii) f'(x) exists almost everywhere on [0,1] and f(x) = ∫₀ˣ f'(t)dt.\n\nFor the second problem:\n\nAssumption:\n- h is a function defined on [0,1].\n\nProblem:\nFind a function h such that ∫₀¹ h’(x)dx < h(1) - h(0).\n\nBut the user's example included an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) even though the original problem didn't state that, which might indicate that in the formatted problem, assumptions should include all necessary conditions, even if they are part of the problem's phrasing. For instance, in part (iii), the condition f(0)=0 is part of the problem statement, so perhaps it should be included in the assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, since part (iii) has \"provided that f(0)=0\", this is a condition given in the problem statement, not an assumption. Therefore, in the assumptions, we list the general conditions, and the problem includes the specific conditions. So for the first problem:\n\nAssumption:\n- f is a function defined on [0,1],\n- f satisfies the Lipschitz condition with constant M.\n\nProblem:\nProve that:\n(i) f is absolutely continuous,\n(ii) f is of bounded variation,\n(iii) f'(x) exists almost everywhere on [0,1] and f(x)=∫₀ˣ f'(t)dt, provided that f(0)=0.\n\nThis way, the assumptions are general, and the specific condition for (iii) is in the problem statement.\n\nFor the second problem:\n\nAssumption:\n- h is a function defined on [0,1].\n\nProblem:\nFind a function h such that ∫₀¹ h’(x)dx < h(1) - h(0).\n\nThis seems appropriate.\n\nHowever, the user's example included an assumption that was part of the problem's conclusion (n divisible by 7), which was incorrect, but following the user's example, perhaps they want all conditions, including those in the problem statement, to be in the assumptions. But that would be incorrect. The correct approach is to separate the assumptions (given conditions) from the problem (what needs to be proven). The problem's specific conditions (like f(0)=0 in part (iii)) should be part of the problem statement, not the assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted first problem should have assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\n- f is a function defined on [0,1],\n- f satisfies the Lipschitz condition (there exists M > 0 such that |f(x) - f(y)| ≤ M|x - y| for all x, y ∈ [0,1]).\n\nProblem:\nProve that:\n(i) f is absolutely continuous,\n(ii) f is of bounded variation,\n(iii) f'(x) exists almost everywhere on [0,1] and f(x) = ∫₀ˣ f'(t)dt, provided that f(0) = 0.\n\nAnd the second problem:\n\nAssumption:\n- h is a function defined on [0,1].\n\nProblem:\nFind a function h such that ∫₀¹ h’(x)dx < h(1) - h(0).\n\nThis seems correct. The assumptions include the general conditions given, and the problem includes specific conditions needed for certain parts.\n\nNow, checking the user's example again, they transformed the original problem which was \"Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91\" into assumptions \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\" and problem \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\". This is incorrect because the original problem's assumption is \"n is an integer\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. This suggests that perhaps the user wants to include any conditions needed for the proof, but that's not correct. The assumptions should be what's given in the problem, not what's needed to prove it.\n\nBut since the user provided that example, perhaps they want to follow that approach. However, that would be incorrect. But since we need to follow the user's example structure, even if flawed, we might have to.\n\nWait, no, the user's instruction says: \"filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" So the task is to extract the assumptions from the problem statement. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is \"n is an integer\". The user's example incorrectly added \"n is divisible by 7\", which is not in the original problem. Therefore, that example might be an error, but we should proceed correctly here.\n\nGiven that, the correct approach is to list the assumptions explicitly stated in the problem. For the first problem here, the assumptions are that f is Lipschitz on [0,1], which includes the domain and the Lipschitz condition. For part (iii), the problem provides an additional condition \"provided that f(0)=0\", which is part of the problem statement for (iii), not an assumption. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- f is defined on [0,1],\n- f satisfies the Lipschitz condition with constant M.\n\nProblem:\nProve that:\n(i) f is absolutely continuous,\n(ii) f is of bounded variation,\n(iii) f'(x) exists almost everywhere on [0,1] and f(x) = ∫₀ˣ f'(t)dt, provided that f(0) = 0.\n\nFor the second problem, the assumption is h is defined on [0,1], and the problem is to find h such that the integral inequality holds.\n\nThus, the final formatted problems are:\n\nFirst problem:\n\nAssumption:\n- f is a function defined on [0,1],\n- f satisfies the Lipschitz condition with constant M.\n\nProblem:\nProve that:\n(i) f is absolutely continuous,\n(ii) f is of bounded variation,\n(iii) f'(x) exists almost everywhere on [0,1] and f(x) = ∫₀ˣ f'(t)dt, provided that f(0) = 0.\n\nSecond problem:\n\nAssumption:\n- h is a function defined on [0,1].\n\nProblem:\nFind a function h such that ∫₀¹ h’(x)dx < h(1) - h(0).\n\nBut the user's original instruction said to structure \"the problem\" (singular), but the original post contains two problems. Therefore, the user might want both to be formatted separately. However, the example given by the user had one problem. Given that, perhaps each main problem in the original post should be formatted separately.\n\nBut the original post's main problem is (i)-(iii), and the second part is a separate question. Therefore, the assistant should format both problems as separate entries.\n\nBut the user's instruction says \"the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange\", which might refer to the entire post as one question, even if it contains multiple parts. However, the example given by the user had a single problem. Given the ambiguity, perhaps the user wants all parts formatted into one problem. But the example included only one problem. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants each part formatted separately. But given the instructions, it's safer to format each problem separately.\n\nHowever, since the user's example included a single problem, perhaps the current problem should be formatted into two separate entries. However, the user hasn't specified. To comply with the user's example, which formatted a single problem, perhaps we should treat each part as a separate problem. But given the instructions, it's better to present both formatted problems.\n\nBut given the user's example, where the original problem had multiple parts (i)-(iii) but was formatted into one problem, perhaps the current problem's three parts should be in one formatted problem, and the second problem about h(x) as another.\n\nTherefore, the final answer would have two formatted problems: one for (i)-(iii) and another for the example function h.",
