    "Content": "I was doing some exercises for linear algebra. One of them was to prove that for any four points $A, B, C, D \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ the following equality holds: $$\\overrightarrow{BC} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{AD}\\ +\\ \\overrightarrow{CA} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{BD}\\ +\\ \\overrightarrow{AB} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{CD}\\ = 0$$ The proof is easy; you just make three vectors starting in $A$ and then see that all the terms cancel out. My question is: what is the geometric interpretation of this equality? How can I visualize it or understand its deeper meaning? Does this equality have a name or where can I read more about it? I'm asking this because it turns out that it is not just a random equality and is rather useful. For example, if we want to prove the existence of orthocenter, we can do it surprisingly easily and quickly using this equality.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $O$ be the orthocenter $O$ of $\\triangle ABC$ . Then \\begin{align}\n&\\overrightarrow{AB}\\cdot\\overrightarrow{CD}\n\\ +\\ \\overrightarrow{BC}\\cdot\\overrightarrow{AD}\n\\ +\\ \\overrightarrow{CA}\\cdot\\overrightarrow{BD}\\\\\n=\\ &\\left(\\overrightarrow{AB}\\cdot\\overrightarrow{CO}\n\\ +\\ \\overrightarrow{BC}\\cdot\\overrightarrow{AO}\n\\ +\\ \\overrightarrow{CA}\\cdot\\overrightarrow{BO}\\right)\n+ \\left(\\overrightarrow{AB}\\cdot\\overrightarrow{OD}\n\\ +\\ \\overrightarrow{BC}\\cdot\\overrightarrow{OD}\n\\ +\\ \\overrightarrow{CA}\\cdot\\overrightarrow{OD}\\right)\\\\\n=\\ &\\left(\\overrightarrow{AB}\\cdot\\overrightarrow{CO}\n\\ +\\ \\overrightarrow{BC}\\cdot\\overrightarrow{AO}\n\\ +\\ \\overrightarrow{CA}\\cdot\\overrightarrow{BO}\\right)\n+ \\left(\\overrightarrow{AB}\\ +\\ \\overrightarrow{BC}\\ +\\ \\overrightarrow{CA}\\right)\\cdot\\overrightarrow{OD}\\tag{$\\dagger$}\\\\\n=\\ &0+0=0.\\\\\n\\end{align} The first bracket on line $(\\dagger)$ is zero because every side of $\\triangle ABC$ is perpendicular to the altitude dropped from the opposite vertex. The second bracket is zero because it is the sum of directed edges of a closed circuit. In short, the identity is basically a cyclic sum of expressions of the form \"side dot altitude\" on $\\mathbb R^2$ , but another cyclic sum of the form \"side dot $\\overrightarrow{OD}$ \" has been added to conceal the significance of the orthocenter and make the identity present in $\\mathbb R^3$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about the geometric interpretation of a vector equality involving four points in 3D space. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The problem states \"for any four points A, B, C, D in R^3\". So the assumptions would include each of these points existing in three-dimensional space. However, the user's example only listed assumptions that were conditions or properties applied to one object each. Here, each point is in R^3, so each point's space should be an assumption. But wait, in the example provided, the assumptions were about 'n' being an integer and divisible by 7. So maybe here the key assumptions are about the four points being in R^3, and perhaps any conditions? Wait, the problem doesn't specify any restrictions beyond the points being in R^3. So the main assumption is that A, B, C, D are points in R^3. However, the user's example listed each assumption line by line, even if they applied to the same object. Wait, in the example, the first assumption was \"n is an integer,\" the second was \"n is divisible by 7.\" Both apply to n. So here, maybe each point's belonging to R^3 is a separate assumption? But that would be four assumptions. Alternatively, maybe \"A, B, C, D are points in R^3\" as a single assumption. But the example split the properties even for the same object. Hmm. Wait, the user's instruction says \"Each assumption addresses only one property or condition, applied to one object.\" So for example, in the original example, two assumptions about n: being an integer and being divisible by 7. Here, for each point, the property is being in R^3. But there are four points. So should each point be a separate assumption? Like:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a point in R^3,\nB is a point in R^3,\nC is a point in R^3,\nD is a point in R^3.\n\nBut that might be redundant. Alternatively, the problem states \"any four points A, B, C, D in R^3\" so the assumption is that all four points are in R^3. But according to the user's example, each assumption is one property per line. So perhaps the assumption here is \"A, B, C, D are points in R^3\" as a single line. Wait, the example had two assumptions for n: being integer and divisible by 7. So each assumption is a separate condition. Here, the only condition is that the four points are in R^3. So maybe the assumption is just that. \n\nBut let me check the user's example again. The original problem had A(n) defined, and the assumption was n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. But the problem as presented in the example was to prove divisibility by 91, and the original problem's assumptions included both n being integer and divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the user wrote \"for every integer n\", but the example in the formatted problem added the assumption \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like a mistake. Wait, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But that's incorrect. Because the original problem didn't state that n must be divisible by 7. Wait, perhaps that example was incorrect? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an extra assumption. Maybe the example was a bad one. But regardless, according to the user's instruction, the task is to list all assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nIn the current problem, the key assumption is that A, B, C, D are any four points in R^3. Since there are four points, each being in R^3, but the problem states \"any four points\", so perhaps the assumption is just that they are points in R^3. But how to split that into individual lines? If each point is considered an object, then each assumption would be \"A is a point in R^3\", \"B is a point in R^3\", etc. But that's four lines. Alternatively, if the problem is about four points in R^3, maybe it's a single assumption. However, according to the user's example, even if the original problem didn't have the \"n is divisible by 7\" assumption, the formatted problem included it. Wait, that example seems to have introduced an extra assumption not present in the original problem. The original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Maybe the user's example was incorrect. Therefore, perhaps I should follow the instruction strictly: list all assumptions of the problem. The problem here is \"for any four points A, B, C, D in R^3\", so the assumption is that A, B, C, D are points in R^3. So that would be one assumption. But according to the user's example, even if the original problem didn't have the second condition, the formatted problem included it. Hmm. Maybe the example is wrong, but the instruction is to list the assumptions as per the problem. So in this case, the problem doesn't have any conditions except that A, B, C, D are in R^3. Therefore, the assumption line is \"A, B, C, D are points in ℝ³\". \n\nBut the user's example had two assumptions for the same object. So maybe in the problem where there are multiple points, each with the same condition, it's okay to list them as a single line. Alternatively, if the problem had different conditions for each object, then each would be separate. Here, all four points have the same condition (being in R^3), so perhaps one line. Then the problem is to prove the given vector equation. \n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nA, B, C, D are points in ℝ³.\n\nProblem:\nProve that for any four points A, B, C, D in ℝ³, the equality \n$$\\overrightarrow{BC} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{AD} + \\overrightarrow{CA} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{BD} + \\overrightarrow{AB} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{CD} = 0$$ \nholds.\n\nBut the original problem in the example included the divisibility by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, maybe there was a misunderstanding in the example. Wait, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. Therefore, in this current problem, since there's no additional condition beyond the four points being in R^3, the assumption is just that. \n\nTherefore, the correct formatted problem should have one assumption: A, B, C, D are points in ℝ³. And the problem is to prove the given equation. But let me double-check the original question. The user's original question says: \"for any four points A, B, C, D ∈ ℝ³\". So the only assumption is that these four points are in ℝ³. So the assumption line is \"A, B, C, D are points in ℝ³\". \n\nHence, the formatted problem is:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nA, B, C, D are points in ℝ³.\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\overrightarrow{BC} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{AD}\\ +\\ \\overrightarrow{CA} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{BD}\\ +\\ \\overrightarrow{AB} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{CD}\\ = 0$$ holds for any four points $A, B, C, D \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$.",
