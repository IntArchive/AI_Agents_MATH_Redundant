    "Content": "This posting consists of several mildly-related questions, motivated from this posting . The main object is the following sequence. $$a_0 = 0, \\qquad a_1 = x, \\qquad a_{n+1} = \\frac{n}{a_n} - a_n - a_{n-1}. \\tag{*}$$ Question 1. Numerical experiment suggests that there is a unique value of $x$ for which $a_n > 0$ for all $n \\geq 1$ . Can we prove/disprove this? If we write $I_n = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R} : a_1 > 0, \\cdots, a_n > 0\\}$ , then obviously $I_n$ is a nested sequence of open sets that begins with $I_1 = (0, \\infty)$ . Moreover, the experiment suggests that $I_n$ are all intervals, and the endpoints of $I_n$ are adjacent poles of $a_{n+1}$ and $a_{n+1}$ is strictly monotone on $I_n$ . Provided this is correct, we easily see that there is a unique zero of $a_{n+1}$ on $I_{n+1}$ , which then determines $I_{n+1}$ . Question 2. The same experiment also suggests that the value of such unique $x$ is $$ \\frac{\\operatorname{AGM}(1,\\sqrt{2})}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\n= \\frac{2\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)}\n\\approx 0.675978240067284728995\\cdots.$$ At this point, I completely have no idea why this value arises, but I have checked that this is correct up to hundreds of digits. (I progressively refined the range of $x$ so that $a_n$ stays positive for a longer time.) Again, will it ever have a chance to be proved? My original suspicion was that we may rearrange the recurrence relation to obtain continued fraction, but it was of no avail. To be honest, I have never seen this type of problem, and will be glad if I can learn anything new about it. Question 3. Given that the above question seems to bold to answer, perhaps we may consider its variants: (Variant 1) $a_0 = 0$ , $a_1 = x$ , and $a_{n+1} = \\frac{n}{a_n} - a_n - p a_{n-1}$ , where $p \\in \\mathbb{R}$ . (Variant 2) $a_0 = 0$ , $a_1 = x$ , and $a_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{a_n} - a_n - a_{n-1}$ . (Variant 3) $a_0 = 0$ , $a_1 = x$ , and $a_{n+1} = \\frac{n^2}{a_n} - a_n - a_{n-1}$ . Again, in each case, numerical experiment suggests that there is a unique $x$ for which $(a_n)_{n\\geq 1}$ stays positive. Moreover, For Variant 1, it seems that $x = 1/\\sqrt{3}$ for $p = -2$ but I have no guess for general $p$ , even when it is an integer. For Variant 2, it is conjectured that $x = 4/3\\sqrt{3}$ . For Variant 3, we can check that $x = 1/\\sqrt{3}$ is such one. Indeed, we find that $a_n = n/\\sqrt{3}$ solves the recurrence relation. Then we may ask whether the version of Question 1-2 can be proved for these variants. Progress. I managed to answer Question 1 . Check this answer .",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "In the first part, I answer Question 2: I prove that the recursion $$\\label{rec}\\tag{1}a_{n+1}=\\frac n{a_n}-a_n-a_{n-1}$$ yields a positive sequence for the initial values $a_0=0$ , $a_1=2\\Gamma(\\frac34)/\\Gamma(\\frac14)$ . (\\ref{rec}) is actually a special discrete Painlevé 1 equation. One survey article mentioned this article by \nJ. Shohat about orthogonal polynomials in which the recursion\nfirst appeared. (See also this preprint which I found after completing my proof).\nThe following proof is inspired by Shohat's article. It also contains proofs\nof some well known facts about orthogonal polynomials to be self-contained. Proof: Consider the inner product $(p,q)=\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-\\frac14x^4}p(x)q(x)\\,dx$ on the real vector space of all polynomials. Since the subspaces of all polynomials\nof degree $\\leq n$ have dimension $n+1$ , there is, for $n\\geq1$ , a unique polynomial $P_n(x)=x^n+...$ such that $(P_n,q)=0$ for all polynomials of degree $<n$ . For convenience,\nwe put $P_0(x)=1$ .\nSince $e^{-\\frac14 x^4}$ is even, we have $P_n(x)=(-1)^nP_n(-x)$ for all $n$ : $P_n$ is even\nor odd if $n$ is even or odd, respectively. Parity will be used in the sequel without \nmentioning it. Claim 1: There are positive constants $\\lambda_n$ such that $$\\label{eqa}\\tag{2}P_{n+1}(x)-x\\,P_n(x)+\\lambda_n P_{n-1}(x)=0\\mbox{ for }n\\geq1.$$ Proof: $P_{n+1}(x)-x\\,P_n(x)$ has degree $<n$ and it is orthogonal to all polynomials $q$ of degree $<n-1$ , because $(xP_n,q)=(P_n,xq)=0$ . Hence there is a constant $\\lambda_n$ such that $P_{n+1}(x)-x\\,P_n(x)=-\\lambda_nP_{n-1}(x)$ . This constant is positive because $$\\lambda_n(P_{n-1},P_{n-1})=(\\lambda_nP_{n-1},P_{n-1})=(xP_n,P_{n-1})=(P_n,xP_{n-1})=(P_n,P_n)$$ and hence $$\\label{eqlam}\\tag{3}\\lambda_n=(P_n,P_n)/(P_{n-1},P_{n-1})\\mbox{ for }n\\geq1.$$ We also introduce, for $n\\geq2$ , the coefficient of $x^{n-2}$ in $P_n$ and name it $d_n$ .\nThe relation (\\ref{eqa}) implies by induction that $$d_n=-(\\lambda_1+\\cdots+\\lambda_{n-1}).$$ Now we can write, for $n\\geq0$ , $$\\label{eqb}\\tag{4}x^3P_n(x)=P_{n+3}(x)+h_nP_{n+1}(x)+\\mbox{ terms of degree below } n.$$ Comparing the coefficients of $x^{n+1}$ shows that the constant $h_0=\\lambda_1+\\lambda_2$ whereas $h_1=-d_4=\\lambda_1+\\lambda_{2}+\\lambda_{3}$ and $$h_n=d_n-d_{n+3}=\\lambda_n+\\lambda_{n+1}+\\lambda_{n+2}\\mbox{ for }n\\geq2.$$ Now we multiply both sides of (\\ref{eqb}) by $P_{n+1}$ and obtain $(x^3P_n,P_{n+1})=h_n(P_{n+1},P_{n+1})$ for $n\\geq0$ . At this point, we use the special\nform of our weight $e^{-\\frac14 x^4}$ - so far, we just used that it is even.\nWe calculate $$(x^3P_n,P_{n+1})=\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\left(e^{-\\frac14 x^4}x^3\\right)\n   P_n(x)P_{n+1}(x)\\,dx=\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-\\frac14 x^4}(P_nP_{n+1})'(x)\\,dx $$ and hence $(x^3P_n,P_{n+1})=(P_n',P_{n+1})+(P_n,P_{n+1}')=(n+1)(P_n,P_n)$ .\nThis yields together with (\\ref{eqlam}) $$n+1=(\\lambda_n+\\lambda_{n+1}+\\lambda_{n+2})\\lambda_{n+1}\\mbox{ for }n\\geq1,$$ whereas $1=(\\lambda_1+\\lambda_2)\\lambda_1$ . If\nwe put $\\lambda_0=0$ for convenience, we have $$n=(\\lambda_{n-1}+\\lambda_n+\\lambda_{n+1})\\lambda_n\\mbox{ for }n\\geq1.$$ Together with $\\lambda_0=0$ , we have a sequence $(\\lambda_n)_{n\\geq1}$ of positive numbers\nas asked in the OP. Now by (\\ref{eqlam}) finally $\\lambda_1=(x,x)/(1,1)=2\\Gamma(\\frac34)/\n\\Gamma(\\frac14)$ because $(1,1)=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}e^{-\\frac14 x^4}\\,dx=2^{-1/2}\\Gamma(\\frac14)$ and $(x,x)=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}e^{-\\frac14 x^4}x^2\\,dx=2^{1/2}\\Gamma(\\frac34)$ .\nThis completes the proof. In part 2, we prove that for the recursion from Question 3, Variant 2, there exists a unique value $x>0$ such that the sequence determined by the initial condition $a_0=0$ , $a_1=x$ remains positive for\nall positive $n$ and that the value of this $x$ is $\\frac4{3\\sqrt3}$ . It is more convenient\nto work with the sequences $(b_n)$ determined by $a_n=\\frac1{\\sqrt3}b_n$ . They satisfy the recursion $$\\label{rec2}\\tag{5} 3=(b_{n+1}+b_n+b_{n-1})b_n\\mbox{ for }n\\geq1.$$ Uniqueness: Any positive sequence $(b_n)$ satisfying (\\ref{rec2})  obviously satisfies $b_n\\leq\\sqrt3$ for all $n$ . Using the recursion in the form $b_n=3/(b_{n+1}+b_n+b_{n-1})$ now yields that $b_n\\geq1/\\sqrt3$ for $n\\geq 1$ . Now $b_n^2+b_{n+1}b_n\\leq3$ for $n\\geq1$ yields that $b_n\\leq B$ for $n\\geq1$ , where $B$ is the positive solution of $B^2+3^{-1/2}B=3$ . In particular $B<\\sqrt3$ . Suppose now that $(b_n)$ and $(b_n')$ are two positive sequences satisfying (\\ref{rec2}).\nThen, as seen above $1/\\sqrt3\\leq b_n,b_n'\\leq B<3$ for $n\\geq1$ . Now put $d_n=b_n'-b_n$ for $n\\geq0$ . Then $d_0=0$ . We assume that $d_1\\neq0$ . The sequence $(d_n)$ satisfies\na recursion obtained by taking the difference of those for $(b_n)$ and $(b_n')$ . It is $$\\label{recd}\\tag{6}d_{n+1}=-\\left(\\frac3{b_nb_n'}+1\\right)d_n-d_{n-1}.$$ Hence we have recursive inequalities $$|d_{n+1}|\\geq\\left(\\frac3{b_nb_n'}+1\\right)|d_n|-|d_{n-1}|\\mbox{ for }n\\geq1.$$ These allow to prove by induction that $$|d_{n+1}|\\geq \\frac3{b_nb_n'}|d_n|\\geq|d_n|\\mbox{ for }n\\geq1.$$ Again by induction, it follows that $|d_n|\\geq \\left(\\frac3{B^2}\\right)^{n-1}|d_1|$ for all $n\\geq1.$ Since $B^2<3$ , this contradicts the fact that all $|d_n|\\leq B-3^{-1/2}$ .\nHence the assumption $d_1\\neq0$ was false and there is at most one positive sequence\nsatisfying (\\ref{rec2}). Existence, first proof: Here we consider every element $b_n=b_n(x)$ of the sequence satisfying (\\ref{rec2}) as a (rational) function of the initial value $b_1(x)=x$ .\nWe show Claim 2: There exist a sequence $(I_n)_{n\\geq1}$ of nested compact intervals \n(that is $I_{n+1}\\subset I_n$ ) such that a) $b_k(I_n)\\subset[3^{-1/2},3^{1/2}]$ for $1\\leq k\\leq n$ . b) $b_n(I_n)=[3^{-1/2},3^{1/2}]$ for all $n\\geq1$ . Since the intersection $\\bigcap_{n\\geq1}I_n$ of nested compact intervals is nonempty, it contains some $x$ such that $b_n(x)>0$ for all $n\\geq1$ . Thus Claim 2 implies the existence of \nsuch an $x$ . Proof of Claim 2: By induction. For $n=1$ , we simply choose $I_1=[3^{-1/2},3^{1/2}]$ . Suppose now that we have found $I_1,\\dots,I_N$ such that a), b) hold for $1\\leq k\\leq n\\leq N$ . Then there exist $t, T\\in I_N$ such that $b_N(t)=3^{-1/2}$ , $b_N(T)=3^{1/2}$ and $b_{N-1}(t)\\leq 3^{1/2}$ , $b_{N-1}(T)\\geq 3^{-1/2}$ .\nThis leads to $b_{N+1}(t)=3/b_N(t)-b_N(t)-b_{N-1}(t)\\geq 3^{3/2}-3^{-1/2}-3^{1/2}>3^{1/2}$ and $b_{N+1}(T)=3/b_N(T)-b_N(T)-b_{N-1}(T)=-b_{N-1}(T)<0$ . We assume $t<T$ ; in the opposite case the\nconsiderations are analogous. Now we apply the intermediate value theorem: \nWe choose $s\\in[t,T]$ maximal such that $b_{N+1}(s)=3^{1/2}$ . Then $b_{N+1}(\\tau)<3^{1/2}$ for $s<\\tau\\leq T$ .\nNow we can choose $S\\in [s,T]$ minimal with $b_{N+1}(S)=3^{-1/2}$ . Then $S>s$ and $3^{-1/2}<b_{N+1}(\\tau)<3^{1/2}$ for $s<\\tau<S$ . If we put $I_{N+1}=[s,S]\\subset I_N$ then\na), b) hold for $1\\leq k\\leq n\\leq N+1$ . This completes the proof of Claim 2. Existence, second proof. Here we show that $b_n$ , $n\\geq1$ are positive if $b_1=4/3$ . This proves the conjecture\nfor Variant 2. The recursion (\\ref{rec2}) shows that all $b_n$ are rational, we find for the first $b_n$ . $$b_2=\\frac{11}{12}, b_3=\\frac{45}{44}, b_4=\\frac{164}{165}, b_5=\\frac{616}{615}.$$ This suggests Claim 3: $b_n=1+1/d_n$ , where $d_{n+1}=-4d_n-d_{n-1}-1$ for $n\\geq1$ and $d_0=-1$ , $d_1=3$ . This Claim implies, of course, that all $b_n$ , $n\\geq1$ are positive. Proof of Claim 3: We consider the sequence $d_n$ , $n\\geq0$ of integers recursively defined as above.\nWe first show $$\\label{rel}\\tag{7}d_{n-1}d_{n+1}=d_n+d_n^2\\mbox{ for }n\\geq1.$$ To show (\\ref{rel}), we proceed by induction. For $n=1$ , it is true. If it is true\nfor some $n$ , we calculate $$\\begin{array}{rcl} d_nd_{n+2}-d_{n+1}-d_{n+1}^2&=&d_n(-4d_{n+1}-d_n-1)-d_{n+1}-d_{n+1}^2\\\\\n         &=& d_{n+1}(-4d_n-d_{n+1}-1)-d_n-d_n^2=d_{n+1}d_{n-1}-d_n-d_n^2=0.\n\\end{array} $$ Now we put $b_n=1+\\frac1{d_n}$ . If we want to prove that they satisfy (\\ref{rec2}), we actually have to show that $$\\frac1{d_{n+1}}=-\\frac3{d_n+1}-\\frac1{d_n}-\\frac1{d_{n-1}}\\mbox{ for }n\\geq1.$$ To show this, we calculate using (\\ref{rel}) and the recursion for the $d_n$ $\\newcommand{\\ds}{\\displaystyle}$ $$\\begin{array}{rcl}\\ds-\\frac3{d_n+1}-\\frac1{d_n}-\\frac1{d_{n-1}}&=&\n    \\ds\\frac{-4d_nd_{n-1}-d_{n-1}-d_n-d_n^2}{d_n(d_n+1)d_{n-1}}\\\\\n   &=&\\ds\\frac{d_{n-1}(d_{n+1}+d_{n-1})-d_{n-1}d_{n+1}}{d_{n+1}d_{n-1}^2}\n =\\ds\\frac1{d_{n+1}}.\\end{array}$$ This completes the proof. In part 3, I consider Variant 1 and prove that, for any real $p$ , there \nexists a unique value $x>0$ such that the recursion \\begin{equation}\\label{eq3}\\tag{8}a_{n+1}=\\frac n{a_n}-a_n-p\\,a_{n-1}\n\\mbox{ for }n\\geq1\\end{equation} yields a positive sequence for the initial values $a_0=0$ , $a_1=x$ and that $x=1/\\sqrt{3}$ for $p=-2$ . Existence: We will use repeatedly that for any real $z$ and positive integer $n$ , the equation $\\frac ny-y=z$ has exacty one positive solution. It can be given explicitly as $y=-\\frac z2+ \\sqrt{\\frac{z^2}4+n}$ . We first prove Lemma 1: There exist two sequences $L_n,U_n$ , $n\\geq0$ such that $L_0=U_0=0$ , $0<L_n<U_n$ for all $n\\geq1$ and $$\\frac n {U_n}-U_n-p t\\leq0\\mbox{ for all }n\\geq1\\mbox{ and }t\\in[L_{n-1},U_{n-1}],$$ $$\\frac n {L_n}-L_n-p t\\geq U_{n+1}\\mbox{ for all }n\\geq1\\mbox{ and }t\\in[L_{n-1},U_{n-1}].$$ Proof: We have to distinguish the cases: $p\\geq0$ and $p<0$ . In the case $p\\geq0$ , we choose $U_n=\\sqrt{n}$ for all $n$ . Then the first inegualities is\nsatisfied whatever $L_n$ we choose. The second inequalities are satisfied\nif we choose as $L_n$ the unique positive solution of $\\frac n{L_n}-L_n=U_{n+1}+p\\,U_{n-1}$ . In the case $p<0$ , we choose recursively $U_n$ as the unique positive solution of $\\frac n{U_n}-U_n=p\\,U_{n-1}$ . Again, the first inequalities are satisfied whatever we choose for $L_n$ . The second inequalities are now satisfied if we choose recursively $L_n$ as the unique positive solution of $\\frac n{L_n}-L_n=U_{n+1}+p\\,L_{n-1}$ . Here again, we consider every element $a_n=a_n(x)$ of the sequence satisfying (\\ref{eq3}) as a (rational) function of the initial value $a_1(x)=x$ .\nUsing Lemma 1, we can now show in a way identical to Claim 2: Claim 4: There exist a sequence $(I_n)_{n\\geq1}$ of nested compact intervals such that a) $a_k(I_n)\\subset[L_k,U_k]$ for $1\\leq k\\leq n$ . b) $a_n(I_n)=[L_n,U_n]$ for all $n\\geq1$ . Since the intersection $\\bigcap_{n\\geq1}I_n$ of nested compact intervals is nonempty,\nit contains some $x$ such that $a_n(x)>0$ for all $n\\geq1$ . Thus Claim 4 implies the existence of \nsuch $x$ . Observe that in the case $p=-2$ , we can simply choose $a_n=n/\\sqrt{3}$ and recursion (\\ref{eq3})\nis satisfied. Uniqueness: In the case $q=-p>0$ , use $a_{n+1}a_n+a_n^2=n+q\\,a_na_{n-1}$ in two ways.\nFirst we estimate $$a_n^2\\leq n+qa_na_{n-a}\\leq n+\\frac12a_n^2+\\frac{q^2}2a_{n-1}^2,$$ hence \\begin{equation}\\label{est1}\\tag{9}a_n^2\\leq 2n+ q^2 a_{n-1}^2.\\end{equation} Then, we estimate using (\\ref{est1}) $$n\\leq a_n^2+a_na_{n+1}\\leq2a_n^2+\\frac14a_{n+1}^2\\leq \\left(2+\\frac{q^2}4\\right)a_n^2+\\frac {n+1}2$$ and find that there is a constant $c$ such that \\begin{equation}\\label{unt1}\\tag{10}a_n\\geq c\\sqrt{n}\\mbox{ for }n\\geq1.\\end{equation} Now we distinguish 3 subcases: If $q>2$ then the equation $t^2+t=q$ has exactly one positive solution $t=\\mu>1$ .\nThe negative solution is $t=-\\mu-1$ . Therefore, we rewrite the inequality following from \n(\\ref{unt1}): $a_{n+1}+a_n-qa_{n-1}=\\frac n{a_n}\\leq \\frac1c\\sqrt n$ as $$(a_{n+1}+(\\mu+1)a_n)-\\mu(a_n+(\\mu+1)a_{n-1})\\leq\\frac1c\\sqrt n$$ and conclude that $$a_{n}+(\\mu+1)a_{n-1}\\leq \\mu^{n-1}a_1 +\\frac1c\\sum_{j=1}^{n-1}\\mu^{n-1-j}\\sqrt j\\leq C \\mu^n,$$ where $C=\\frac1\\mu a_1+\\frac1{c\\mu}\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty\\sqrt j\\mu^{-j}$ . If $q=2$ then we obtain $\\mu=1$ and in the same way that $a_n+2a_{n-1}\\leq C n^{3/2}$ with some constant $C$ .\nIf $0<q<2$ then the equation $t^2+t=q$ has exactly one positive solution $t=\\mu<1$ and \nthe negative solution is again $t=-\\mu-1$ . We conclude as above that there is a constant $C$ such that $a_n+(\\mu+1)a_{n-1}\\leq C \\sqrt{n}$ . Altogether, we found that for all $q$ and every solution of (\\ref{eq3}) there is a constant $C$ such that $a_n\\leq C n^{3/2}\\max(1,\\mu)^n$ , where $\\mu$ is the positive solution of $t^2+t=q$ . Now if $a_n$ , $a_n'$ , $n\\geq0$ are two positive solutions of (\\ref{eq3}) then the sequence $d_n=a_n-a_n'$ satisfies $d_0=0$ and $$d_{n+1}=-\\left(\\frac{n}{a_na_n'}+1\\right)d_n+qd_{n-1}\\mbox{ for }n\\geq1.$$ Since $q>0$ , the sequence $d_n$ is alternating and we have $$|d_{n+1}|=\\left(\\frac{n}{a_na_n'}+1\\right)|d_n|+q|d_{n-1}|\\geq2|d_n|+q|d_{n-1}|\n \\mbox{ for }n\\geq1.$$ Using the unique solution $\\lambda>2$ of $t^2=2t+q$ , \nwe rewrite this as $$|d_{n+1}|+(\\lambda-2)|d_n|\\geq \\lambda\\, (|d_{n}|+(\\lambda-2)|d_{n-1}|)\\mbox{ for }n\\geq1.$$ This implies by induction that $|d_{n}|+(\\lambda-2)|d_{n-1}|\\geq \\lambda^{n-1}|d_1|$ and hence\nalso $|d_n|\\geq\\lambda^{n-1}|d_1|/(\\lambda-1)$ .\nNow the previous considerations show that there is a constant $C$ such that $|d_n|=|a_n-a_n'|\\leq C n^{3/2}\\max(1,\\mu)^n$ where $\\mu$ is the positive solution of $t^2+t=q$ .\nSince $\\max(1,\\mu)<\\lambda$ , the assumption $|d_1|>0$ would lead to a contradiction.\nThus $d_1=0$ , hence all $d_n=0$ and $a_n=a_n'$ for all $n$ .\nThis proves uniqueness in the case $q=-p>0$ . The proof of the uniqueness of $x$ in the case $p>0$ is very different.\nWe will use as an essential tool the function $w(n,z)$ defined for real $z$ and positive integer $n$ as the unique positive solution $w$ of $\\frac nw-w=z$ . It can be given explicitly as \\begin{equation}\\nonumber\nw(n,z)=-\\frac z2+\\sqrt{\\frac{z^2}4+n}=\\frac n{\\frac z2+\\sqrt{\\frac{z^2}4+n}}.\n\\end{equation} Observe that for any positive $n$ , the mapping $z\\to w(n,z)$ is strictly decreasing\nbecause the derivative of the mapping $w\\to\\frac nw-w$ is always negative. Step 1:\nConsider now a sequence $a_n$ , $n=0,1,\\dots$ , verifying (\\ref{eq3}) for some parameter $p\\geq0$ .\nNote that we do not indicate the dependence upon $p$ of most objects below with the exception of\nsome ``constants'' in step 4. We have $a_{n+1}a_n+a_n^2+pa_{n-1}a_n=n$ for $n\\geq1$ . Hence \\begin{equation}\n\\label{ineqbas}\\tag{11}a_n\\leq\\sqrt n\\mbox{ and }a_{n-1}a_n\\leq\\frac np\\mbox{ for }n\\geq1.\n\\end{equation} Using the sequence $U_1(n)=\\sqrt{n}$ , we have $0\\leq a_n\\leq U_1(n)$ for all $n$ .\nNow define $L_1(n)$ by $L_1(0)=0$ and $L_1(n)=w(n,U_1(n+1)+pU_1(n-1))$ for $n\\geq1$ .\nSince $a_{n+1}+pa_{n-1}\\leq U_1(n+1)+pU_1(n-1)$ , we find that $a_n=w(n,a_{n+1}+pa_{n-1})\\geq L_1(n)$ for all $n$ . We have $0\\leq L_1(n)\\geq w(n,0)=U_1(n)$ for all $n$ . Next, define $U_2(0)=0$ and $U_2(n)=w(n,L_1(n+1)+pL_1(n-1))$ for positive $n$ .\nThen $0\\leq L_1(m)\\leq a_m\\leq U_1(m)$ for $m=n-1,n+1$ imply that $L_1(n)\\leq a_n \\leq U_2(n)\\leq U_1(n)$ for all $n$ .\nContinuing like this we define $L_2(0)=0$ and $L_2(n)=w(n,U_2(n+1)+pU_2(n-1))$ for positive $n$ and find $L_1(n)\\leq L_2(n)\\leq a_n \\leq U_2(n)$ for all $n$ . In the same way, we define the sequences $U_k(n)$ , $L_k(n)$ , $n=0,1,...$ satisfying \\begin{equation}\\nonumber\nU_{k+1}(n)=w(n,L_k(n+1)+pL_k(n-1))\\mbox{ and } L_k(n)=w(n,U_k(n+1)+pU_k(n-1))\n\\end{equation} and $L_k(n)\\leq L_{k+1}(n)\\leq a_n \\leq U_{k+1}(n)\\leq U_k(n)$ for all $n$ and every positive\nsequence $a_n$ satisfying (\\ref{eq3}). Finally, we consider the pointwise limits \\begin{equation}\\nonumber\nU(n)=\\lim_{k\\to\\infty}U_k(n)\\mbox{ and } L(n)=\\lim_{k\\to\\infty}L_k(n)\n\\end{equation} which exist because for fixed $n$ , the sequences $U_k(n)$ , $L_k(n)$ , $k=1,2,...$ are monotonous and bounded. The properties of the sequences $U_k$ , $L_k$ imply\nbesides $U(0)=L(0)=0$ a) $L(n)\\leq a_n\\leq U(n)$ for every $n$ and every positive sequence $a_n$ satisfying (\\ref{eq3}), b) $U(n)=w(n,L(n+1)+pL(n-1))$ and $L(n)=w(n,U(n+1)+pU(n-1))$ for all positive $n$ . As a consequence of b), the two sequences $A_n,B_n$ , $n=0,1,...$ , defined by $A_n=U(n),\\,B_n=L(n)$ if $n$ is even and $A_n=L(n),\\,B_n=U(n)$ if $n$ is odd\nboth satisfy the recursion (\\ref{eq3}).\nThe uniqueness of $x$ defining a positive sequence via recursion (\\ref{eq3}) is proved once we\nshow Claim 5: $L(n)=U(n)$ for all $n$ or, equivalently, $A_n=B_n$ for all $n$ . Observe that the above construction of $L(n)$ and $U(n)$ can be used to approximate\nthe unique positive sequence $a_n$ satisfying (\\ref{eq3}).\nFor $p=1,3,10$ , we find \\begin{equation}\\nonumber\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}n&1&2&3&4&5&6&7&8&9&10\\\\\\hline\np=1&0.6760&0.8034&1.010&1.156&1.294&1.416&1.529&1.634&1.733&1.827\\\\\n\\hline\np=3&0.7671&0.5365&0.8900&0.8713&1.050&1.099&1.210&1.277&1.360&1.427\\\\\n\\hline\np=10&0.9066&0.1964&0.9192&03804&0.9443&0.5470&0.9798&0.6947&1.023&0.8243\n\\end{array}\n\\end{equation} This sequence $a_n$ , $n=0,1,...$ is not monotonous for small $n$ unless $p$ is small.\nThis contributes to the difficulty of proving the uniqueness. Step 2\nIn order to prove the Claim 5, i.e. uniqueness, consider the non-negative\nsequence $D_n=(-1)^n(A_n-B_n)$ . It satisfies $D_0=0$ and \\begin{equation}\\label{eqD}\\tag{12}\nD_{n+1}=\\left(\\frac n{A_nB_n}+1\\right)D_n-p\\,D_{n-1}\\mbox{ for }n\\geq1.\n\\end{equation} The subtraction makes the present case $p\\geq0$ harder than the previous one $p<0$ ,\nin particular for\nlarge $p$ . For small $p$ , things are easy. It is sufficient to use $$D_{n+1}\\geq 2D_n-p\\,D_{n-1}$$ which follows from (\\ref{ineqbas}) and (\\ref{eqD}). If $0\\leq p<1$ , then using the solution $\\lambda\\in]1,2]$ of $\\lambda=2-\\frac p\\lambda$ ,\nwe can show by induction that $D_{n+1}\\geq\\lambda D_n$ for all $n\\geq1$ .\nIndeed, this inequality is true for $n=1$ and if we have $D_{n}\\geq\\lambda D_{n-1}$ , then $D_{n-1}\\leq \\frac1\\lambda D_n$ and hence $$D_{n+1}\\geq 2D_n-p\\,D_{n-1}\\geq\\left(2-\\frac p\\lambda\\right)D_n=\\lambda D_n.$$ As a consequence, we find for all $n\\geq1$ that $D_n\\geq \\lambda^{n-1} D_1$ which contradicts $D_n=|A_n-B_n|\\leq\\sqrt n$ unless $D_1=0$ (yielding $A_n=B_n$ for all $n$ ). If $p=1$ , we prove similarly that $D_{n+1}\\geq\\frac{n+1}n D_n$ for all $n\\geq1$ and\nhence $D_n\\geq nD_1$ again contradicting $D_n\\leq\\sqrt n$ unless $D_1=0$ . For $p>1$ , we have to work considerably harder to prove uniqueness. Step 3\nWe prove some auxiliary statements improving (\\ref{ineqbas}). These are valid for any\npositive sequence $a_n$ satisfying (\\ref{eq3}). \\begin{equation}\n\\label{anbelow}\\tag{13}\na_n\\geq \\frac1{r(p)}\\sqrt n,\\mbox{ for all }n\\geq1\\mbox{ and }p\\geq1,\n\\mbox{ where }r(p)=1/w(1,p+1).\n\\end{equation} Proof: We have \\begin{equation}\\nonumber\n\\frac n{a_n}-a_n=a_{n+1}+pa_{n-1}\\leq\\sqrt{n+1}+p\\sqrt{n-1}\\leq (p+1)\\sqrt n\n\\end{equation} since $\\sqrt{n+1}+\\sqrt{n-1}\\leq2\\sqrt n$ . Hence $b_n=a_n/\\sqrt n$ satisfies $\\frac1{b_n}-b_n\\leq p+1$ and hence $b_n\\geq w(1,p+1)=1/r(p)$ . \\begin{equation}\n\\label{anabove}\\tag{14}\na_n\\leq\\frac1{q(p)}\\frac n{\\sqrt{n-1}}\\mbox{ for all }n\\geq2,\\,p\\geq1,\\mbox{ where }\nq(p)=1/w(1,(p+1)/r(p)).\n\\end{equation} Proof: We have using (\\ref{anbelow}) \\begin{equation}\\nonumber\n\\frac n{a_n}-a_n=a_{n+1}+pa_{n-1}\\geq \\frac1 {r(p)}(\\sqrt{n+1}+p\\sqrt{n-1})\n   \\geq\\frac{p+1}{r(p)}\\sqrt{n-1}.\n\\end{equation} Thus $a_n\\leq w(n,\\frac{p+1}{r(p)}(n-1))\\leq\\frac n{\\sqrt{n-1}}w(1,\\frac{p+1}{r(p)}).$ Observe that $r(p)$ and $q(p)$ are increasing with $p$ . Here we use that $\\frac{p+1}{r(p)}=1/\\left[\\frac12+\\sqrt{\\frac14+\\frac 1{(p+1)^2}}\\right]$ . \\begin{equation}\n\\label{anan-1}\\tag{15}\na_na_{n-1}\\leq \\frac n{t(n,p)}\\mbox{ for all }n\\geq3,p\\geq1,\\mbox{ where }\n   t(n,p)=\\frac p2+\\sqrt{\\frac{p^2}4+\\frac{n(n-2)}{(n-1)^2}q(1)^2}.\n\\end{equation} Proof: We have $a_n^2+pa_{n-1}a_n\\leq n$ , hence \\begin{equation}\\nonumber\na_n\\leq -\\frac p2 a_{n-1}+\\sqrt{\\frac{p^2}4a_{n-1}^2+n}\n    =\\frac n{\\frac p2 a_{n-1}+\\sqrt{\\frac{p^2}4a_{n-1}^2+n}}.\n\\end{equation} Thus \\begin{equation}\\nonumber\na_na_{n-1}\\leq \\frac n{\\frac p2+\\sqrt{\\frac{p^2}4+\\frac n {a_{n-1}^2}}}.\n\\end{equation} The rest follows using (\\ref{anabove}): $\\frac n{a_{n-1}^2}\\geq n q(p)^2\\frac{n-2}{(n-1)^2}\n\\geq\\frac{n(n-2)}{(n-1)^2}q(1)^2$ .\nNote that $q(1)\\geq 1.4966$ . For $n=2$ , the same proof shows using $a_1\\leq1$ that \\begin{equation}\\label{a2a1}\\tag{16}\na_2a_1\\leq \\frac 2{t(2,p)}\\mbox{ where }\n        t(2,p)=\\frac p2+\\sqrt{\\frac{p^2}4+2}.\n\\end{equation} Observe that $t(n,p)$ increases with $p$ and also increases\nwith $n\\geq3$ . Step 4 Assume that $p\\geq1$ and that we do not have uniqueness. Then $A_n\\neq B_n$ for all $n\\geq1$ . Otherwise, that is if $A_n=B_n$ for some $n\\geq1$ then in the case $n=1$ we of course have $A_n=B_n$ for all $n$ by the recursion.\nIn the case $n>1$ we have by construction $pA_{n-1}+A_{n+1}=pB_{n-1}+B_{n+1}$ and hence $A_{n-1}=B_{n-1}$ and $A_{n+1}=B_{n+1}$ because the differences $A_{n-1}-B_{n-1}$ and $A_{n+1}-B_{n+1}$ cannot have opposite sign by construction.\nThis leads to $A_n=B_n$ for all $n$ also in the second case. The recursion (\\ref{eqD}) indicates that $D_{n+1}/D_n$ might be large if $A_nB_n$ is small.\nThis suggests to introduce the sequence $F_n=A_nB_n\\frac{D_{n+1}}{D_n}$ , $n\\geq1$ ,\nwhere again $D_n=(-1)^n(A_n-B_n)$ .\nWe show later Lemma 2: We have $F_n\\geq\\frac12n$ for all $n\\geq1$ . If the Lemma is proved, Claim 5 follows readily. Using the definition of $F_n$ and\n(\\ref{anabove}), we find that $D_{n+1}/D_n\\geq\\frac{n-1}{2n}q(p)^2\\geq\\frac{n-1}{2n}q(1)^2\\geq\\frac{n-1}{2n}\\cdot2.23$ and this is larger than $C:=1.0035$ if $n\\geq10$ . Therefore $D_n\\geq C^{n-10}D_{10}$ for $n\\geq 10$ contradicting $D_n=|A_n-B_n|\\leq \\sqrt n$ . Thus the assumption $A\\neq B$ must have been false and Claim 5 is proved. Proof of Lemma 2: First by (\\ref{eqD}), we have $F_1=A_1B_1D_2/D_1=A_1B_1+1$ .\nWe estimate $A_1$ using $\\frac1{A_1}-A_1=A_2\\leq\\sqrt2$ and obtain $A_1\\geq w(1,\\sqrt2)$ . We have as well $B_1\\geq w(1,\\sqrt2)$ .\nWe conclude that $F_1\\geq1+w(1,\\sqrt2)^2=:C_1\\geq1.267$ . We have by (\\ref{eqD}) \\begin{equation}\\label{eqF}\\tag{17}\nF_n=n+A_nB_n-\\frac {pA_nB_nA_{n-1}B_{n-1}} {F_{n-1}}\n\\end{equation} For $n=2$ , we find $$\\begin{array}{crlcl}F_2&=&2+A_2B_2-\\frac {pA_2B_2A_{1}B_{1}} {F_{1}}\\\\\n  &\\geq&  2+A_2B_2A_1B_1-\\frac {pA_2B_2A_{1}B_{1}} {F_{1}}\n   &\\geq&\n  2+pA_2B_2A_{1}B_{1}\\left(\\frac1p-\\frac1{F_1}\\right) .\\end{array}$$ If $p\\leq F_1$ , then we find that $F_2\\geq2$ .\nOtherwise, we use (\\ref{a2a1}) and find $$F_2\\geq 2+\\frac {4p}{t(2,p)^2}\\left(\\frac1p-\\frac1{F_1}\\right)\\geq\n   2+\\frac {4}{t(2,p)^2}-\\frac {4p}{t(2,p)^2C_1}.$$ In order to minimize the right hand side\nit is convenient\nto use $t=t(2,p)$ as independent variable and replace $p=t-\\frac2t$ .\nThus we have to minimize $$g(t)=2+\\frac4{t^2}-\\frac4{C_1t}+\\frac8{C_1t^3}.$$ This is a polynomial of degree 3 in the variable $s=1/t$ and can easily be minimized for positive $s$ using elementary calculus. Observe that\nthe derivative with respect to $s$ is negative for $s=0$ and strictly increasing.\nTherefore there is a unique minimum on the set of all $s\\geq0$ .\nWe find that $F_2\\geq C_2:=1.559$ . For $n=3$ , we find in the same way $F_3\\geq  3+pA_3B_3A_{2}B_{2}\\left(\\frac1{2p}-\\frac1{F_2}\\right)$ and either $F_3\\geq3$ in case $p\\leq F_2/2$ or else using (\\ref{anan-1}) $$F_3\\geq 3+\\frac{9}{2t(3,p)^2}-\\frac{9p}{C_2t(3,p)^2}.$$ To minimize the right hand side, we use again $t=t(3,p)$ as independent variable\nand replace (see (\\ref{anan-1})) $p$ by $p=t-\\frac34\\frac{q(1)^2}{t}$ . Thus we have to\nminimize here $$g(t)=3+\\frac9{2t^2}-\\frac9{C_2t}+\\frac{27q(1)^2}{4C_2t^3}.$$ Here, we find $F_3\\geq C_3=1.931.$ Thus we have shown $F_n\\geq\\frac n2$ for $n=1,2,3.$ For $n\\geq4$ , we proceed analogously for the inductive step. So we assume that $F_{n-1}\\geq\\frac12(n-1)$ . First we use (\\ref{eqF}), estimate using (\\ref{anabove})\nthat $1\\geq\\frac{n-2}{(n-1)^2}q(p)^2A_{n-1}B_{n-1}$ and hence with $q(p)\\geq q(1)$ $$F_n\\geq n + A_nB_nA_{n-1}B_{n-1}\\left(\\frac{n-2}{(n-1)^2}q(1)^2-\\frac p{F_{n-1}}\\right).$$ If the big parenthesis is positive, we are done. Otherwise, we use (\\ref{anan-1}) and the\ninduction hypothesis: $$F_n\\geq n + \\frac{n^2}{t(n,p)^2}\\left(\\frac{n-2}{(n-1)^2}q(1)^2-\\frac{2p}{{n-1}}\\right).$$ We obtain $F_n\\geq n/2$ if and only if $$\\frac12+\\frac1{t(n,p)^2}\\left(\\frac{n(n-2)}{(n-1)^2}q(1)^2-\\frac{2pn}{{n-1}}\\right)\\geq0$$ for all $n\\geq 4$ and $p\\geq1$ .\nAgain, if the big parenthesis is positive, there is nothing to prove. If it is negative,\nwe can use that $t(n,p)$ increases with $n$ and then that the parenthesis becomes less negative\nwith $n$ . Therefore it is sufficient to prove the inequality for $n=4$ and all $p\\geq1$ .\nThis can be done in the same way as before using $t=t(4,p)$ as independent variable\nand $p=t-\\frac{8q(1)^2}{9t}$ . So we have to minimize here $$g(t)=\\frac12+\\frac89 q(1^2)\\frac1 t^2 - \\frac8{3t}+\\frac{64}{27}q(1)^2\\frac1{t^3}$$ and check that the minimum is positive.\nWe find as minimum $g(1/0.3028416...)=0.02248044...>0$ . This completes the proof of\nthe Lemma. Thus Claim 5 and hence uniqueness is proved also for $p>1$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem and structure it according to the given format. The user provided an example where they listed assumptions and the problem. I need to do the same here.\n\nFirst, the original question on Math Stack Exchange has the title: \"Showing that $a_{n+1}=\\frac{n}{a_n}-a_n-a_{n-1}$ with $a_0 = 0$ and $a_1=2\\Gamma(\\frac34)\\big/\\Gamma(\\frac14)$ stays positive for $n\\geq1$.\" \n\nThe user is asking to structure the problem by listing assumptions and the problem statement. From the example, assumptions are specific conditions applied to one object each. Let's look into the problem's content.\n\nIn the question, the main sequence is defined by:\n- $a_0 = 0$,\n- $a_1 = x$ (but in the title, $a_1$ is given as a specific value involving Gamma functions),\n- $a_{n+1} = \\frac{n}{a_n} - a_n - a_{n-1}$.\n\nThe problem has several parts (Question 1, 2, 3), but the user wants to filter unrelated information. The example provided only focused on the main problem, so maybe here we should focus on the main problem stated in the title and the first part of Question 1, which is about proving that there's a unique x (the specific Gamma value) such that all $a_n$ stay positive for n ≥ 1.\n\nLooking at the original problem's title, the specific value is given for $a_1$, so the assumption would include the initial conditions and the recurrence relation. Wait, but in the problem statement, the user mentions \"the main object is the following sequence\" with $a_0 = 0$, $a_1 = x$, and the recurrence. However, in the title, $a_1$ is set to a specific value. There's a bit of conflict here between the general case (where $a_1 = x$ is a variable) and the specific case where $a_1$ is given. However, the problem in the title is to show that with that specific $a_1$, the sequence stays positive.\n\nSo, the problem is to show that with $a_0 = 0$, $a_1$ being that Gamma function expression, the sequence defined by the recurrence stays positive for all n ≥1.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should list:\n\n1. $a_0 = 0$,\n2. $a_1 = \\frac{2\\Gamma(\\frac{3}{4})}{\\Gamma(\\frac{1}{4})}$,\n3. The recurrence relation: $a_{n+1} = \\frac{n}{a_n} - a_n - a_{n-1}$ for all n ≥1.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption applied to the sequence. Then the problem is to prove that for all n ≥1, $a_n >0$.\n\nBut in the original problem description, the user mentions Question 1, which is about proving that there exists a unique x such that all a_n >0. However, the title is specifically about showing that with the given a_1 (the Gamma value), the sequence stays positive. So I need to focus on the problem in the title, not the more general Question 1.\n\nWait, the title says: \"stays positive for $n\\geq1$\", so the problem is to show that with a_0=0 and a_1 being that specific value, the sequence remains positive for all n≥1.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- $a_0 = 0$,\n- $a_1 = \\frac{2\\Gamma(\\frac{3}{4})}{\\Gamma(\\frac{1}{4})}$,\n- For all n ≥1, $a_{n+1} = \\frac{n}{a_n} - a_n - a_{n-1}$.\n\nEach of these is a separate line. The problem is to prove that for all n ≥1, $a_n >0$.\n\nBut wait, the original problem in the body also mentions that Question 1 is about proving that there's a unique x such that all a_n >0. But in the title, the value of x is given, so maybe the problem here is specifically about that given x. Therefore, the formatted problem should include the assumptions as the initial conditions and recurrence, and the problem is to show positivity.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the problem is not about finding x but proving that with the given x (the Gamma ratio), the sequence stays positive. So the assumptions are the initial terms and the recurrence relation. Each assumption is one line.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n$a_0 = 0$,\n$a_1 = \\frac{2\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)}$,\nFor each $n \\geq 1$, $a_{n+1} = \\frac{n}{a_n} - a_n - a_{n-1}$.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $a_n > 0$ for all $n \\geq 1$.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, there's also a note that the user managed to answer Question 1, but the main problem here is about the specific a_1 value. So the formatted problem should capture that specific case.\n\nI think that's correct. Each assumption is on a separate line, addressing one condition. The problem is to show positivity for all n ≥1 given those assumptions.",
