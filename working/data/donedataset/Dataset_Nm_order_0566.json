    "Content": "Every proof I've seen of Euler's Theorem (that $\\gcd(a,m) = 1 \\implies a^{\\phi(m)} \\equiv 1 \\pmod m$ ) involves the fact that the units of $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z}$ form a group of order $\\phi(m)$ .  While this is a perfectly good proof, I have to wonder if it was the one that Euler used.  I know that there are fairly old precursors to group theory, but it still seems incongruous. Thus, my question is: Are there proofs of Euler's Theorem that do not use group/ring theory?  In particular, what proof (if any; I don't know whether Euler actually discovered the theorem) did Euler use himself?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Consider the set of all numbers less than $n$ and relatively prime to it. Let $\\{a_1,a_2,...,a_{\\varphi(n)}\\}$ be this set. Consider a number $c < n$ and relatively prime to it i.e. $c \\in \\{a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_{\\varphi(n)}\\}$. First observe that for any $a_i$, $c a_{i} \\equiv a_{j} \\pmod{n}$ for some $j$.\n(True since $c$ and $a_i$ are themselves relatively prime to $n$, their product has to be relatively prime to $n$. This follows immediately from the definition). If $c a_{i} \\equiv c a_{j} \\pmod{n}$ then $a_i = a_j$.\n(True as cancellation can be done since $c$ is relatively prime to $n$). Hence, if we now consider the set $\\{ca_1,ca_2,...,ca_{\\varphi(n)}\\}$ this is just a permutation of the set $\\{a_1,a_2,...,a_{\\varphi(n)}\\}$. Thereby, we have $\\displaystyle \\prod_{k=1}^{\\varphi(n)} ca_k \\equiv \\prod_{k=1}^{\\varphi(n)} a_k \\pmod{n}$. Hence, we get $\\displaystyle c^{\\varphi(n)} \\prod_{k=1}^{\\varphi(n)} a_k \\equiv \\prod_{k=1}^{\\varphi(n)} a_k \\pmod{n}$. Now, note that $\\displaystyle \\prod_{k=1}^{\\varphi(n)} a_k$ is relatively prime to $n$ and hence you can cancel them on both sides to get $$c^{\\varphi(n)} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}$$ whenever $(c,n) = 1$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to format this Math Stack Exchange question according to the specified structure. Let me read through the original problem again to understand what's being asked. The title is \"Proof of Euler's Theorem without abstract algebra?\" and the question is about whether there are proofs of Euler's Theorem that don't use group or ring theory, specifically asking if Euler himself used a different approach.\n\nFirst, the user wants me to list all assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then, restate the problem concisely. The example given includes assumptions about the variables involved and any conditions they must satisfy.\n\nLooking at the original problem, the key elements are Euler's Theorem, which states that if gcd(a, m) = 1, then a^φ(m) ≡ 1 mod m. The user is asking for proofs that don't use group theory, which is the usual approach via the group of units in Z/mZ. So the assumptions here would be the conditions of Euler's Theorem itself, right?\n\nWait, the problem isn't to prove Euler's Theorem, but rather to ask if there's a proof without using abstract algebra concepts like groups or rings. So the assumptions would be the conditions required for Euler's Theorem to hold, since the question is about the theorem's proof. So, the main assumption is that a and m are coprime, i.e., gcd(a, m) = 1. Then, the problem is to prove the congruence without using group/ring theory.\n\nBut the user is also asking about historical context, like what proof Euler used. However, the format seems to require the problem statement to be a mathematical problem to solve, not a historical question. Wait, the example given was a problem to prove something is divisible by 91. So maybe in this case, the problem is to \"Prove Euler's Theorem without using group/ring theory\" with the assumption being gcd(a, m) = 1.\n\nBut the original question is phrased as asking whether such proofs exist and what Euler used, not directly asking for the proof. Hmm, this might be a bit tricky. The user wants the problem structured as per the format, which in the example was taking a problem statement and extracting assumptions. But here, the Math Stack Exchange question is more of a meta-question about proofs of a theorem. How do I fit that into the format?\n\nWait, looking back at the instructions: \"Your task is to read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" The example took the original problem, which was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and in the formatted version, listed assumptions (n is integer, n divisible by 7) and the problem statement. However, in the example, the original problem's assumption about n being an integer wasn't explicitly stated in the original problem, but the formatted version included it. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is that n is an integer. Then, the formatted version's assumption includes \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", but wait, the original problem didn't say n is divisible by 7. Wait, the example given by the user seems to have a mistake. Wait, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Because in the original problem, it's for every integer n, but the formatted version adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That doesn't make sense. Unless there was a typo in the example. Maybe the original problem actually had a condition that n is divisible by 7, but in the example provided by the user, it's stated as \"for every integer n\". Hmm, perhaps the example is incorrect, but regardless, I need to follow the user's instructions.\n\nBut back to the current problem. The Math Stack Exchange question is asking for a proof of Euler's Theorem without abstract algebra, and what proof Euler used. To structure this into the given format, the problem part would be \"Prove Euler's Theorem without using group/ring theory\", and the assumptions would be the conditions of Euler's Theorem, which are that a and m are coprime. So:\n\nAssumption:\ngcd(a, m) = 1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that a^φ(m) ≡ 1 mod m without using group/ring theory.\n\nAdditionally, the original question also asks about the historical aspect, but according to the example, perhaps that part is considered \"unrelated information\" and should be filtered out. The example filtered the original problem to just the mathematical statement and assumptions, ignoring any context or additional questions. So in this case, the core problem is to prove Euler's Theorem without group theory, so the formatted problem would focus on that, excluding the historical part about Euler's original proof.\n\nTherefore, the structured problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\ngcd(a, m) = 1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that a^φ(m) ≡ 1 (mod m) without using group/ring theory.\n\nThat seems to fit the format. Each assumption is one condition, applied to the objects (a and m being coprime). The problem is to prove the congruence under that assumption, with the additional constraint of not using abstract algebra methods.",
