Suppose that $x\\ge-1$ and for a non-negative integer $n$ , we have $$\n(1+x)^n-nx\\ge1\n$$ Then $$\n\\begin{align}\n(1+x)^{n+1}-(n+1)x\n&=(1+x)^n-nx+x(1+x)^n-x\\\\\n&\\ge1+x((1+x)^n-1)\\\\\n&\\ge1\n\\end{align}\n$$ If $-1\\le x\\le0$ , then both $x$ and $(1+x)^n-1$ are negative. If $x\\ge0$ , then both both $x$ and $(1+x)^n-1$ are positive. Therefore, if $x\\ge-1$ , $x((1+x)^n-1)\\ge0$ . This justifies the last inequality above. Note that if $x\\ne0$ and $n\\ge1$ , the last inequality is strict. Thus, for $x\\ne0$ and $n\\ge2$ , we have $$\n(1+x)^n\\gt1+nx\n$$ Negative Exponents Bernoulli's Inequality is also true for negative integer exponents.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to show that the sequence y_n = (1 + 1/n)^(n+1) is decreasing. The user mentioned considering the ratio y_{n+1}/y_n but got stuck. Let me start by writing down what that ratio would look like.\n\nSo, y_n is (1 + 1/n)^{n+1}, and y_{n+1} would be (1 + 1/(n+1))^{n+2}. So the ratio is [(1 + 1/(n+1))^{n+2}] / [(1 + 1/n)^{n+1}]. Maybe simplifying this ratio will help. Let me write it out:\n\n(y_{n+1}/y_n) = [ ( (n+2)/(n+1) )^{n+2} ] / [ ( (n+1)/n )^{n+1} ] \n\nHmm, that's the same as (n+2)/(n+1) raised to the (n+2) power multiplied by (n/(n+1))^{n+1}. Wait, maybe if I combine the terms. Let's see:\n\nLet me write it as [(n+2)/(n+1)]^{n+2} * [n/(n+1)]^{n+1} = [n/(n+1)]^{n+1} * [(n+2)/(n+1)]^{n+2}\n\nBut this seems a bit messy. Maybe taking the natural logarithm of the ratio would be easier because logarithms turn exponents into multipliers, which might simplify things. Let me try that.\n\nLet’s denote L = ln(y_{n+1}/y_n) = (n+2) * ln(1 + 1/(n+1)) - (n+1) * ln(1 + 1/n)\n\nNow, I need to show that this L is less than 0, because if the logarithm of the ratio is negative, then the ratio itself is less than 1, which would mean y_{n+1} < y_n, hence the sequence is decreasing.\n\nSo let's compute L:\n\nFirst, ln(1 + 1/(n+1)) = ln((n+2)/(n+1)) = ln(n+2) - ln(n+1)\n\nSimilarly, ln(1 + 1/n) = ln((n+1)/n) = ln(n+1) - ln(n)\n\nSubstituting back into L:\n\nL = (n+2)(ln(n+2) - ln(n+1)) - (n+1)(ln(n+1) - ln(n))\n\nLet me distribute the terms:\n\nL = (n+2)ln(n+2) - (n+2)ln(n+1) - (n+1)ln(n+1) + (n+1)ln(n)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n= (n+2)ln(n+2) - [ (n+2) + (n+1) ] ln(n+1) + (n+1)ln(n)\n\nSimplify the coefficients:\n\nThe coefficient of ln(n+1) is - (2n + 3), so:\n\nL = (n+2)ln(n+2) - (2n + 3)ln(n+1) + (n+1)ln(n)\n\nHmm, not sure if that's helpful. Maybe another approach. Let's try to see if the function f(x) = (1 + 1/x)^{x+1} is decreasing for x ≥ 1. Taking the derivative might be another method. Let's compute the derivative of f(x) and show that it's negative for x ≥ 1.\n\nLet’s set f(x) = (1 + 1/x)^{x+1}. Take natural logarithm:\n\nln(f(x)) = (x + 1) ln(1 + 1/x)\n\nDifferentiate both sides with respect to x:\n\nf’(x)/f(x) = derivative of (x+1)ln(1 + 1/x). Use product rule:\n\nLet u = x + 1, v = ln(1 + 1/x). Then:\n\nd/dx [uv] = u’v + uv’ = 1 * ln(1 + 1/x) + (x + 1) * [ derivative of ln(1 + 1/x) ]\n\nCompute derivative of ln(1 + 1/x):\n\nLet’s denote w = 1 + 1/x, so derivative is (1/w) * (-1/x²) = -1/(x²(1 + 1/x)) = -1/(x(x + 1))\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nf’(x)/f(x) = ln(1 + 1/x) + (x + 1)*(-1)/(x(x + 1)) = ln(1 + 1/x) - 1/x\n\nThus, f’(x) = f(x) [ ln(1 + 1/x) - 1/x ]\n\nWe need to show that f’(x) < 0. Since f(x) is always positive (as it's an exponential), the sign of f’(x) depends on the sign of [ ln(1 + 1/x) - 1/x ].\n\nTherefore, we need to show that ln(1 + 1/x) < 1/x for x ≥ 1.\n\nWait, is this true? Let me check for x = 1: ln(2) ≈ 0.693 < 1/1 = 1. True.\n\nFor x = 2: ln(3/2) ≈ 0.405 < 1/2 = 0.5. Yes, 0.405 < 0.5.\n\nIn general, we know that for t > -1, t ≠ 0, ln(1 + t) < t. Here, t = 1/x, which is positive for x > 0. So ln(1 + t) < t. Hence, ln(1 + 1/x) < 1/x, which implies that [ ln(1 + 1/x) - 1/x ] < 0. Therefore, f’(x) < 0. Hence, f(x) is decreasing for x ≥ 1. Therefore, the sequence y_n is decreasing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the ratio approach. Let's go back to the ratio y_{n+1}/y_n and try to show it's less than 1.\n\nSo:\n\ny_{n+1}/y_n = [(1 + 1/(n+1))^{n+2}]/[(1 + 1/n)^{n+1}]\n\nLet me rewrite 1 + 1/(n+1) = (n+2)/(n+1), and 1 + 1/n = (n+1)/n.\n\nSo:\n\n= [(n+2)/(n+1)]^{n+2} / [(n+1)/n]^{n+1}\n\n= [(n+2)/(n+1)]^{n+2} * [n/(n+1)]^{n+1}\n\n= [ (n+2)/(n+1) ) * (n/(n+1))^{ (n+1)/(n+2) } ] Wait, no, more straightforward:\n\nLet me separate the exponents:\n\n= [ (n+2)/(n+1) )^{n+1} * (n+2)/(n+1) ) ] * [n/(n+1)]^{n+1}\n\n= [ (n+2)/(n+1) * n/(n+1) ) ]^{n+1} * (n+2)/(n+1)\n\n= [ n(n+2)/( (n+1)^2 ) ) ]^{n+1} * (n+2)/(n+1)\n\nNow, let's compute the first part: [n(n+2)/(n+1)^2]^{n+1}\n\nNote that n(n+2) = n^2 + 2n, and (n+1)^2 = n^2 + 2n +1. So n(n+2) = (n+1)^2 -1. Therefore,\n\nn(n+2)/(n+1)^2 = 1 - 1/(n+1)^2\n\nSo the term becomes [1 - 1/(n+1)^2]^{n+1}\n\nIt is known that (1 - x)^k ≤ e^{-kx} for x < 1. Let me apply this inequality here. Let x = 1/(n+1)^2, k = n+1. Then:\n\n[1 - 1/(n+1)^2]^{n+1} ≤ e^{ - (n+1)/(n+1)^2 } = e^{ -1/(n+1) }\n\nTherefore, the first part is ≤ e^{-1/(n+1)}. Then, multiplying by (n+2)/(n+1):\n\nSo y_{n+1}/y_n ≤ e^{-1/(n+1)} * (n+2)/(n+1)\n\nWe need to show that this product is less than 1. Let's check for n=1:\n\nLeft side: e^{-1/2} * (3/2) ≈ 0.6065 * 1.5 ≈ 0.9098 < 1. Okay.\n\nFor n=2: e^{-1/3} * 4/3 ≈ 0.7165 * 1.333 ≈ 0.955 < 1.\n\nBut this approach only gives an upper bound, and it's approaching 1 as n increases, so maybe this isn't sufficient for all n. Maybe another way.\n\nAlternatively, take the expression [n(n+2)/(n+1)^2]^{n+1} * (n+2)/(n+1)\n\nLet me write the entire ratio as:\n\n[ (n+2)/(n+1) ) / ( (n+1)/n ) ] * [ (n+2)/(n+1) ) / ( (n+1)/n ) ]^{n+1}\n\nWait, perhaps not. Alternatively, let's take the ratio and manipulate it:\n\ny_{n+1}/y_n = [ (1 + 1/(n+1)) / (1 + 1/n) ]^{n+1} * (1 + 1/(n+1))\n\nSimplify the first part:\n\n[ ( (n+2)/(n+1) ) / ( (n+1)/n ) ]^{n+1} = [ (n(n+2))/(n+1)^2 ) ]^{n+1}\n\nWhich is the same as before. Then multiply by (1 + 1/(n+1)) = (n+2)/(n+1)\n\nSo overall:\n\n[ (n(n+2))/(n+1)^2 ) ]^{n+1} * (n+2)/(n+1)\n\nHmm, perhaps taking logarithms here would help. Let me compute ln(y_{n+1}/y_n) as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using induction. Assume that y_n ≥ y_{n+1}, then show y_{n+1} ≥ y_{n+2}. But not sure.\n\nWait, but earlier approach with the derivative seems solid. Since f(x) is differentiable and f’(x) < 0 for all x ≥ 1, then the function is decreasing on [1, ∞), hence the sequence y_n = f(n) is decreasing.\n\nAlternatively, using the inequality between arithmetic and geometric mean. Let me think. For example, considering the terms in (1 + 1/n)^{n+1}, maybe express it as the product of (n+1) terms of (1 + 1/n), multiplied by an extra term? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider the ratio y_{n}/y_{n-1} and show it's less than 1, but maybe that's similar to the original approach.\n\nBut since the derivative method worked, maybe that's the way to go. So the key idea is to take the natural logarithm, differentiate, and show the derivative is negative, hence the function is decreasing, hence the sequence is decreasing.\n\nBut the problem is to structure the problem according to the user's format. Let me look back at the example:\n\nOriginal problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91. The user formatted the assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem was for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, an assumption was added that n is divisible by 7. Wait, but that might be a mistake in the example? Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which seems conflicting. Maybe the user made a mistake in the example, but following their instruction, we need to list all assumptions. However, in the given problem here, the sequence is defined for n ∈ ℕ, n ≥ 1. So the assumptions would be that n is a natural number, n ≥ 1. But the problem is to show the sequence is decreasing, so for all n ≥ 1, y_{n+1} ≤ y_n. Therefore, the assumptions are n is a natural number and n ≥ 1. However, in the example, they added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (divisible by 7), which might have been part of a different problem. Wait, maybe the original example was different. Let me check:\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Maybe the example has a mistake. But regardless, according to the user's instruction, we need to list all assumptions of the problem. In the current problem, the assumptions are that n is a natural number (n ∈ ℕ) and n ≥ 1. So each assumption should be a single line. Then the problem is to show that the sequence is decreasing.",
