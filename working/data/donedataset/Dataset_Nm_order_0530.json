    "Content": "Classical Hardy's inequality (cfr. Hardy-Littlewood-Polya Inequalities , Theorem 327) If $p>1$, $f(x) \\ge 0$ and $F(x)=\\int_0^xf(y)\\, dy$ then $$\\tag{H} \\int_0^\\infty \\left(\\frac{F(x)}{x}\\right)^p\\, dx < C\\int_0^\\infty (f(x))^p\\, dx $$ unless $f \\equiv 0$. The best possibile constant is $C=\\left(\\frac{p}{p-1}\\right)^p$ . I would like to prove the statement in italic regarding the best constant. As already noted by Will Jagy here , the book suggests stress-testing the inequality with $$f(x)=\\begin{cases} 0 & 0\\le x <1 \\\\ x^{-\\alpha} & 1\\le x \\end{cases}$$ with $1/p< \\alpha < 1$, then have $\\alpha \\to 1/p$. If I do so I get for $C$ the lower bound $$\\operatorname{lim sup}_{\\alpha \\to 1/p}\\frac{\\alpha p -1}{(1-\\alpha)^p}\\int_1^\\infty (x^{-\\alpha}-x^{-1})^p\\, dx\\le C$$ but now I find myself in trouble in computing that lim sup. Can someone lend me a hand, please? UPDATE: A first attempt, based on an idea by Davide Giraudo, unfortunately failed. Davide pointed out that the claim would easily follow from $$\\tag{!!} \\left\\lvert \\int_1^\\infty (x^{-\\alpha}-x^{-1})^p\\, dx - \\int_1^\\infty x^{-\\alpha p }\\, dx\\right\\rvert \\to 0\\quad \\text{as}\\ \\alpha \\to 1/p. $$ But this is false in general: for example if $p=2$ we get $$\\int_1^\\infty (x^{-2\\alpha} -x^{-2\\alpha} + 2x^{-\\alpha-1}-x^{-2})\\, dx \\to \\int_1^\\infty(2x^{-3/2}-x^{-2})\\, dx \\ne 0.$$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "What you need isn't $$\\lim_{\\alpha\\searrow1/p}\\,\\left\\lvert \\int_1^\\infty (x^{-\\alpha}-x^{-1})^p\\mathrm dx - \\int_1^\\infty x^{-\\alpha p }\\mathrm dx\\right\\rvert=0$$ but $$\\lim_{\\alpha\\searrow1/p}\\frac{\\int_1^\\infty (x^{-\\alpha}-x^{-1})^p\\mathrm dx}{\\int_1^\\infty x^{-\\alpha p }\\mathrm dx}=1\\;,$$ which is indeed the case, since as $\\alpha\\searrow1/p$ , the integrals are more and more dominated by regions where $x^{-1}\\ll x^{-\\alpha}$ .

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The example provided shows that the assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. Then, the problem statement follows.\n\nLooking at the original problem on Hardy's inequality, the goal is to compute the best constant C in the inequality (H). The user mentions that the best possible constant is (p/(p-1))^p, and they're trying to prove that. The question involves stress-testing the inequality with a specific function f(x) and taking a limit as α approaches 1/p.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that p > 1, f(x) ≥ 0, and F(x) is the integral from 0 to x of f(y) dy. Then, the inequality (H) holds with the best constant being (p/(p-1))^p. The user is using a test function f(x) defined piecewise: zero up to x=1 and x^-α for x ≥1, with 1/p < α <1, then taking α to 1/p.\n\nThe assumptions here would be:\n- p is a real number greater than 1.\n- The function f is non-negative.\n- F is defined as the integral of f from 0 to x.\n- The test function f is piecewise: 0 for 0 ≤ x <1 and x^{-α} for x ≥1.\n- The parameter α satisfies 1/p < α < 1.\n- The limit as α approaches 1/p is considered.\n\nEach assumption should be one line, addressing one property or condition of one object. So breaking it down:\n\n1. p is a real number.\n2. p > 1.\n3. f(x) is a non-negative function.\n4. F(x) = ∫₀ˣ f(y) dy for all x ≥ 0.\n5. f(x) = 0 for 0 ≤ x < 1.\n6. f(x) = x^{-α} for x ≥ 1.\n7. α is a real number such that 1/p < α < 1.\n8. The limit as α approaches 1/p from above is considered.\n\nBut wait, in the original problem statement, they mention using the test function f with 1/p < α <1 and then taking α→1/p. So the key assumptions here are about p, f, F, and the specific form of f used for testing. Also, the problem is to prove that the best constant is (p/(p-1))^p.\n\nSo the problem statement is to compute the best possible constant C in Hardy's inequality, which is claimed to be (p/(p-1))^p. The user's specific issue is handling the lim sup as α approaches 1/p for the integral involving the test function, but the main problem is proving that C is indeed that value.\n\nSo structuring the assumptions and problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- p is a real number.\n- p > 1.\n- f is a non-negative function.\n- F(x) is the integral of f from 0 to x.\n- f(x) = 0 for 0 ≤ x < 1.\n- f(x) = x^{-α} for x ≥ 1.\n- α is a real number where 1/p < α < 1.\n- The limit is taken as α approaches 1/p.\n\nProblem: Compute the best possible constant C in the inequality ∫₀^∞ (F(x)/x)^p dx < C ∫₀^∞ (f(x))^p dx, which is equal to (p/(p-1))^p.\n\nWait, but in the example given by the user, the assumption includes specific conditions on n (being an integer and divisible by 7). Here, the problem is more about the general Hardy inequality with specific test functions. However, the original problem statement's main focus is proving that the best constant is (p/(p-1))^p. The test function is part of the method to find the constant.\n\nBut according to the user's instruction, the assumptions should be those given in the problem. The problem mentions p >1, f non-negative, F defined as integral of f. Then, in the method to find C, the test function is used. However, the problem is about proving the best constant, which requires considering such test functions. But in the problem statement, the user is specifically asking about computing the lim sup part when using that test function.\n\nBut maybe the problem, as per the user's question, is to compute that lim sup to show that the best constant is C=(p/(p-1))^p. So the problem is to compute the lim sup as α approaches 1/p of [ (α p -1)/(1 - α)^p ∫₁^∞ (x^{-α} - x^{-1})^p dx ] ≤ C, and show that this lim sup gives the desired constant.\n\nBut the user's exact problem is in the Question section: they need help computing the lim sup part. However, the task here is to structure the problem according to the given format, which requires listing the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nWait, the example given by the user took the original problem, which had an assumption that n is an integer and n divisible by 7, but in the formatted problem, only the necessary assumptions were listed. The example original problem had the number A(n) to be proved divisible by 91, and the formatted problem listed n is integer, n divisible by 7, and the problem statement was to prove A(n) divisible by 91. Wait, but in that example, the original problem didn't have n divisible by 7 as an assumption; instead, the user added that as an assumption when formatting. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions are \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" But wait, that's incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", which doesn't require n to be divisible by 7. However, in the formatted problem, the user added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the example was illustrative but not accurate. But regardless, the user's instruction is to structure the problem by listing the assumptions and the problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the user is referring to Hardy's inequality with certain conditions. The main assumptions are p>1, f≥0, F is the integral of f. Then, the test function f is given as piecewise with parameters. The problem is to compute the best constant C, which is (p/(p-1))^p. The user's specific difficulty is computing the lim sup as α approaches 1/p of that integral expression.\n\nBut according to the format, the problem should be structured with assumptions and problem. So, the assumptions should include all the conditions given in the problem, which include p>1, f non-negative, F(x) defined as integral from 0 to x of f(y)dy, and for the test function, f(x) is zero on [0,1), x^{-α} on [1, ∞), with α in (1/p, 1), and taking α approaching 1/p. The problem is to compute the best possible constant C in Hardy's inequality, which equals (p/(p-1))^p.\n\nSo, to list the assumptions:\n\n1. p is a real number greater than 1.\n2. f(x) is a non-negative function.\n3. F(x) is defined as the integral from 0 to x of f(y) dy.\n4. The test function f(x) is defined as 0 for 0 ≤ x < 1.\n5. The test function f(x) is defined as x^{-α} for x ≥ 1.\n6. α is a real number satisfying 1/p < α < 1.\n7. The limit is considered as α approaches 1/p from above.\n\nProblem: Compute the best possible constant C in the inequality ∫₀^∞ (F(x)/x)^p dx < C ∫₀^∞ (f(x))^p dx, which is equal to (p/(p-1))^p.\n\nBut the original problem statement in the user's post says: \"the best possible constant is C=(p/(p-1))^p. I would like to prove the statement in italic regarding the best constant.\" So the problem is to prove that the best constant is that value. The user is stuck on computing the lim sup part when using the test function.\n\nBut according to the example, the formatted problem should include the problem as stated, and the assumptions should be the conditions given. So maybe the assumptions here are the general conditions of Hardy's inequality plus the specific test function used.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key assumptions are those necessary to set up the problem. Let me re-express:\n\nThe Hardy inequality (H) is given under the conditions p>1, f ≥0, F(x) = ∫₀ˣ f(y) dy. The problem is to prove that the best constant C is (p/(p-1))^p. To do this, the user is testing with a specific f and needs to compute the lim sup.\n\nBut the user's specific problem is computing the lim sup in their approach. However, the task is to structure the problem as per the example, which for the original example included assumptions that weren't all in the original problem (like n divisible by 7), which might have been a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe in the example, the user made a mistake, but the instruction is to structure the problem by listing the assumptions from the original problem, filtering unrelated information. The original example's problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted version incorrectly added \"n divisible by 7\" as an assumption, but actually, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so that assumption is not needed. Hence, maybe the example is flawed, but the user's instruction is to follow the format.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question is about proving the best constant in Hardy's inequality. The assumptions given in the problem are p>1, f ≥0, F(x) = ∫₀ˣ f(y) dy. The user is using a test function to find the lower bound of C, and they're stuck on computing the lim sup. But the main problem is to prove that the best constant is (p/(p-1))^p.\n\nThus, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. p is a real number greater than 1.\n2. f is a non-negative function.\n3. F(x) is the integral of f from 0 to x.\n4. The test function f is defined piecewise: 0 on [0,1), x^{-α} on [1, ∞).\n5. α is a real number such that 1/p < α < 1.\n6. The limit is taken as α approaches 1/p from above.\n\nProblem: Prove that the best possible constant C in Hardy's inequality ∫₀^∞ (F(x)/x)^p dx < C ∫₀^∞ f(x)^p dx is C = (p/(p-1))^p.\n\nBut the user's specific problem in the question is about computing the lim sup arising from using the test function. However, according to the example, the formatted problem should capture the main problem statement, not the user's intermediate steps. The original problem is to prove that the best constant is C=(p/(p-1))^p, using the test function approach, and encountering difficulty with the lim sup.\n\nBut the format requires the problem to be stated as the main question. Therefore, the assumptions include the conditions on p, f, F, the specific test function, and the parameter α approaching 1/p. The problem is to compute the best constant C, which is claimed to be (p/(p-1))^p.\n\nWait, the user's exact question is: \"I would like to prove the statement in italic regarding the best constant.\" The italic statement is \"The best possible constant is C=(p/(p-1))^p.\" So the problem is to prove that C is indeed that value.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have assumptions including the general conditions of Hardy's inequality (p>1, f≥0, F defined as integral), and then the problem is to prove that the best constant is (p/(p-1))^p. However, in the user's approach, they are using a specific test function, so perhaps the assumptions should also include the use of that test function and the limit as α→1/p.\n\nBut in the example, the formatted problem included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (n divisible by 7), which might have been a mistake, but following the user's example, perhaps we should include the test function conditions as assumptions.\n\nThus, the assumptions would be:\n\n- p is a real number.\n- p > 1.\n- f(x) is a non-negative function.\n- F(x) = ∫₀ˣ f(y) dy for all x ≥ 0.\n- The function f is defined as f(x) = 0 for 0 ≤ x < 1.\n- The function f is defined as f(x) = x^{-α} for x ≥ 1.\n- α is a real number such that 1/p < α < 1.\n- The limit as α approaches 1/p is considered.\n\nProblem: Prove that the best possible constant C in the inequality ∫₀^∞ (F(x)/x)^p dx < C ∫₀^∞ (f(x))^p dx is C = (p/(p-1))^p.\n\nBut checking the original problem statement, the user mentions that the book suggests testing with that specific f(x), so perhaps the use of that test function is part of the problem's method, but not an assumption of the inequality itself. However, since the user is stuck on computing the lim sup with that test function, perhaps the assumptions should include the use of that particular test function.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the main assumptions for the inequality are p>1, f≥0, F integral of f. The problem is to find the best C. To approach it, the test function is used, but in structuring the problem, perhaps the test function's conditions are part of the problem's setup.\n\nHmm. This is a bit ambiguous. The example provided by the user seems to have included an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem. Maybe they intended to filter out some conditions. In the current case, perhaps the key assumptions are p>1, f≥0, F integral of f, and the problem is to find the best C. However, the user's specific problem involves the test function, so to structure their question, which is about computing the lim sup with that test function, the assumptions should include the test function's definition and the limit.\n\nBut according to the user's instructions, we need to \"filter the unrelated information\" and structure the problem. The original problem's main statement is about proving the best constant C=(p/(p-1))^p for Hardy's inequality. The user's specific issue is with the test function approach, so the formatted problem should reflect that context.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would include:\n\n- p is a real number greater than 1.\n- f is a non-negative function.\n- F is the integral of f from 0 to x.\n- The test function f is defined as 0 for 0 ≤ x < 1 and x^{-α} for x ≥ 1.\n- α is a real number satisfying 1/p < α < 1.\n- The limit is taken as α approaches 1/p from above.\n\nProblem: Compute the best possible constant C in the inequality ∫₀^∞ (F(x)/x)^p dx < C ∫₀^∞ (f(x))^p dx, which is equal to (p/(p-1))^p.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to prove the best constant, and the user is using a specific method involving that test function, the problem statement could be phrased as proving that the best constant is (p/(p-1))^p by evaluating the lim sup as α approaches 1/p of [ (α p -1)/(1 - α)^p ∫₁^∞ (x^{-α} - x^{-1})^p dx ].\n\nBut the exact problem the user is asking is to compute that lim sup. However, according to the example, the formatted problem should capture the main problem, not the intermediate step. The main problem is proving the best constant, and the user's question is about a step in that proof.\n\nBut the user's instruction is to structure the problem as per the example. In the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem was to prove that under the assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But in reality, the original problem was for all integers n, so the formatted example might have been incorrect.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, but following the user's example, perhaps the formatted problem should include the specific assumptions related to the method being used (the test function), even if they are part of the approach rather than the original problem's general statement.\n\nTherefore, final answer would be:\n\nAssumption: \n- p is a real number.\n- p > 1.\n- f(x) is a non-negative function.\n- F(x) = ∫₀ˣ f(y) dy for all x ≥ 0.\n- f(x) = 0 for 0 ≤ x < 1.\n- f(x) = x^{-α} for x ≥ 1.\n- α is a real number satisfying 1/p < α < 1.\n- The limit is considered as α approaches 1/p from above.\n\nProblem: Compute the best possible constant C in the inequality ∫₀^∞ (F(x)/x)^p dx < C ∫₀^∞ (f(x))^p dx, which is equal to (p/(p-1))^p.\n\nBut to match the example's style, perhaps some assumptions can be combined. For instance, the function f's definition can be split into two lines for each piece.\n\nYes, each assumption should address only one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- p is a real number.\n- p > 1.\n- f(x) is a non-negative function.\n- F(x) is the integral of f(y) from 0 to x.\n- f(x) = 0 for all x in [0, 1).\n- f(x) = x^{-α} for all x ≥ 1.\n- α is a real number.\n- 1/p < α < 1.\n- The limit is taken as α approaches 1/p.\n\nProblem: Prove that the best possible constant C in Hardy's inequality ∫₀^∞ (F(x)/x)^p dx < C ∫₀^∞ (f(x))^p dx is C = (p/(p-1))^p.\n\nBut the user's problem is specifically about handling the lim sup in their computation with the test function. However, the task is to structure the problem as per the example, which seems to include the method's assumptions into the problem's assumptions. So I think this is the way to go.",
