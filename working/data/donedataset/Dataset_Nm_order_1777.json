    "Content": "In Hatcher's book on Algebraic Topology in Chapter 0 (where the Homotopy Extension Property is discussed) the claim is being made that there is no retraction of $I^2$ into $I \\times \\{0\\} \\cup A \\times I$ where $A = \\{0, 1, \\frac 12 , \\frac 13, \\ldots \\}$. However I couldn't come up with a proof. One can define a retraction if there is only a finite number of \"teeth in the comb\". It's not clear to me why continuity fails (presumably) at 0 if one tries to extend this retraction to the infinite case.\nI hope someone can help out.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If $f$ is a retraction, then it must map $(0,1)$ to $(0,1)$. Since it is continuous, there must a ball $A$ centered on $(0,1)$ such that $f(A)$ is contained in the ball $B$ of radius $\\frac 12$ centered on $(0,1)$. However $A$ must contain a point of the form $(\\frac 1n,1)$ for some $n$ (which also maps to itself under $f$), and then the points $(\\frac tn,1)$ for $0\\le t\\le 1$ all lie in $A$ too. Then $t\\to f(\\frac tn,1)$ is a path in the comb from $(0,1)$ to $(\\frac 1n,1)$. Since there is no such path in the comb that doesn't wander outside $B$, $f$ cannot exist.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's start by reading the problem from Math Stack Exchange. The user is asking about why there's no retraction from I² (the unit square) onto the comb space, specifically I×{0} ∪ A×I where A is {0, 1, 1/2, 1/3, ...}. They mention that Hatcher claims this in Chapter 0 regarding the Homotopy Extension Property. The user is confused because with finite teeth, a retraction works, but continuity fails at 0 in the infinite case.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the problem and list the assumptions properly. The key objects here are I², the comb space, and the set A. The problem is about retraction, so assumptions should include the definitions of these spaces and the conditions for a retraction.\n\nAssumptions should be each a single condition applied to one object. Let me break it down:\n\n1. I is the closed interval [0, 1].\n2. I² is the unit square, i.e., I × I.\n3. A is the set {0, 1, 1/2, 1/3, ..., 1/n, ...} for positive integers n.\n4. The comb space is defined as I × {0} ∪ A × I.\n5. A retraction is a continuous map r: I² → comb space such that r(x) = x for all x in the comb space.\n\nThe problem is to prove that no such retraction exists. The user's confusion is about why continuity fails at 0 when moving from finite to infinite teeth. The key here is likely related to the topology of the comb space and the properties of continuous functions, especially around the limit point (0,0) where the teeth accumulate.\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is a single line, addressing one property or condition of one object. Let me check:\n\n- The interval I is defined. Check.\n- The square I² is defined. Check.\n- Set A is defined with specific points. Check.\n- Comb space is the union of the base and the teeth. Check.\n- Retraction's continuity and idempotence on the comb space. Check.\n\nThat seems to cover all necessary assumptions. The problem statement is to show no such retraction exists. So the formatted problem should list these assumptions and then state the problem to prove no retraction exists.",
