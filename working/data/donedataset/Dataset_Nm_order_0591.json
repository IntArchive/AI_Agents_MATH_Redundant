    "Content": "I am having problems being able to formally demonstrate when a function is bijective (and therefore, surjective and injective). Here's an example: How do I prove that $g(x)$ is bijective? \\begin{align}\nf &: \\mathbb R \\to\\mathbb R \\\\\ng &: \\mathbb R \\to\\mathbb R \\\\\ng(x) &= 2f(x) + 3\n\\end{align} However, I fear I don't really know how to do such. I realize that the above example implies a composition (which makes things slighty harder?). In any case, I don't understand how to prove such (be it a composition or not). For injective, I believe I need to prove that different elements of the codomain have different preimages in the domain . Alright, but, well, how? As for surjective, I think I have to prove that all the elements of the codomain have one, and only one preimage in the domain , right? I don't know how to prove that either! EDIT f is a bijection. Sorry I forgot to say that.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The way to verify something like that is to check the definitions one by one and see if $g(x)$ satisfies the needed properties. Recall that $F\\colon A\\to B$ is a bijection if and only if $F$ is: injective : $F(x)=F(y)\\implies x=y$, and surjective : for all $b\\in B$ there is some $a\\in A$ such that $F(a)=b$. Assuming that $R$ stands for the real numbers, we check. Is $g$ injective? Take $x,y\\in R$ and assume that $g(x)=g(y)$. Therefore $2f(x)+3=2f(y)+3$. We can cancel out the $3$ and divide by $2$, then we get $f(x)=f(y)$. Since $f$ is a bijection, then it is injective, and we have that $x=y$. Is $g$ surjective? Take some $y\\in R$, we want to show that $y=g(x)$ that is, $y=2f(x)+3$. Subtract $3$ and divide by $2$, again we have $\\frac{y-3}2=f(x)$. As before, if $f$ was surjective then we are about done, simply denote $w=\\frac{y-3}2$, since $f$ is surjective there is some $x$ such that $f(x)=w$. Show now that $g(x)=y$ as wanted. Alternatively, you can use theorems. What sort of theorems? The composition of bijections is a bijection. If $f$ is a bijection, show that $h_1(x)=2x$ is a bijection, and show that $h_2(x)=x+2$ is also a bijection. Now we have that $g=h_2\\circ h_1\\circ f$ and is therefore a bijection. Of course this is again under the assumption that $f$ is a bijection.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants to prove that the function g(x) = 2f(x) + 3 is bijective, given that f is a bijection. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what bijective means. A function is bijective if it's both injective and surjective. Injective means one-to-one: if g(a) = g(b), then a = b. Surjective means onto: for every y in the codomain, there's an x such that g(x) = y.\n\nThe problem states that f is a bijection. So f is both injective and surjective. Now, g is defined as 2f(x) + 3. Let me think about how scaling and shifting affect injectivity and surjectivity.\n\nStarting with injectivity. Suppose g(a) = g(b). Then 2f(a) + 3 = 2f(b) + 3. Subtract 3 from both sides: 2f(a) = 2f(b). Divide both sides by 2: f(a) = f(b). Since f is injective, this implies a = b. So g is injective because f is injective and the linear transformation (multiply by 2, add 3) preserves injectivity here. The scaling by 2 is key; if it were zero, it wouldn't work, but 2 is non-zero, so it's invertible.\n\nNow for surjectivity. Take any y in ℝ. We need to find an x such that 2f(x) + 3 = y. Let's solve for f(x): f(x) = (y - 3)/2. Since f is surjective, there exists some x in ℝ such that f(x) = (y - 3)/2. Therefore, substituting back, g(x) = y. So g is surjective because f is surjective and the linear transformation allows us to adjust y accordingly.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify the function f is bijective in the original question. Oh, wait, the user edited to say that f is a bijection. So that's a crucial assumption. Without f being bijective, we couldn't conclude. For example, if f wasn't surjective, then maybe (y - 3)/2 isn't in the image of f, so g wouldn't be surjective. Similarly, if f wasn't injective, then even if 2f(a) +3 equals 2f(b)+3, we couldn't guarantee a = b.\n\nSo the key assumptions here are that f is a bijection (both injective and surjective), and that the functions are from ℝ to ℝ. Also, the operations applied (multiplying by 2 and adding 3) are linear transformations. Since 2 is a non-zero scalar, multiplying by 2 preserves injectivity and surjectivity when the original function is bijective. Adding 3 is just a shift, which doesn't affect injectivity or surjectivity in this case because the codomain is all real numbers.\n\nTherefore, the problem's assumptions should include that f is bijective, and that the domain and codomain of f and g are real numbers. The problem is to prove that g(x) = 2f(x) + 3 is bijective given these conditions.",
