    "AcceptedAnswer": "A month has a Friday 13th if and only if it begins on a Sunday. On a regular (non-leap) year, if January begins on day $k$, $0\\leq k\\leq 6$ (with $k=0$ being Sunday), then we have that: January begins on day $k$; February begins on day $k+3\\bmod 7$ (since January has 31 days, and $31\\equiv 3\\pmod{7}$; March begins on day $k+3\\bmod 7$; April begins on day $k+6\\bmod 7$; May begins on day $k+8=k+1\\bmod 7$ (since April has 30 days, and $30\\equiv 2\\pmod{7}$); June begins on day $k+4\\bmod 7$; July begins on day $k+6\\bmod 7$; August begins on day $k+9 = k+2\\bmod{7}$; September begins on day $k+5\\bmod 7$; With these, we already have day $k$, $k+1$, $k+2$, $k+3$, $k+4$, $k+5$, and $k+6$, so at least one of these months will begin on Sunday, guaranteeing at least one Friday 13th. For Leap years, the analysis is similar, except that: January begins on day $k$; February begins on day $k+3$; March begins on day $k+4$; April begins on day $k$; May begins on day $k+2$; June begins on day $k+5$; July begins on day $k$; August begins on day $k+3$; September begins on day $k+6$; October begins on day $k+1$. So at the latest, you will have a Friday 13th by October.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided helps clarify the expectations. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the original problem. The question is to prove that every year has at least one Friday the 13th. The source is the 2010 ISI B Math UGB. \n\nLooking at the example given, the assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. In the example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. However, in the original problem statement, it's possible that the user might have included some extraneous information that needs to be filtered out. Wait, in the example, the original problem states \"for every integer n\" but the formatted assumption includes both n being an integer and divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the divisibility by 7 wasn't mentioned. The example's formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example was a mistake, but the user provided it as an example of how to structure. Wait, let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which would mean n is any integer, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps there was a mistake in the example. Maybe the original problem actually required n to be divisible by 7, but the user made a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the example is illustrative, even if incorrect, to show how to structure. The user might have intended that sometimes assumptions need to be extracted even if not explicitly stated. Hmm, confusing. But in any case, the task here is to process the given problem about Friday the 13th.\n\nSo the problem is to prove that every year has at least one Friday the 13th. Now, the assumptions here: first, we need to consider the Gregorian calendar, since different calendars might have different structures. The problem probably assumes a standard calendar system. Also, the year is a standard year, not a leap year, or maybe considering both leap and common years. Wait, the problem states \"every year\", which includes both common and leap years. So perhaps the assumptions would include:\n\n- The Gregorian calendar is used.\n- A year is either a common year or a leap year.\n- A common year has 365 days.\n- A leap year has 366 days.\n- The days of the week cycle every 7 days.\n\nBut wait, the user's example had two assumptions, but maybe in this problem, the key assumptions are about the calendar system. However, the user's instructions say to filter out unrelated information. The original question as given is \"Prove that every year has at least one Friday the 13th.\" The source is 2010 ISI B Math UGB. So perhaps the key assumptions here are related to the structure of the calendar. Let me think. The problem is about the existence of a Friday the 13th in every year. To model this, we need to consider how the days of the week shift each year and how months start. Each month's 13th day will be a certain day of the week, and we need to show that regardless of how the days are arranged, there's always at least one Friday the 13th.\n\nSo possible assumptions:\n\n- The calendar system is the Gregorian calendar (since leap years are defined with specific rules).\n- A common year has 12 months with specific numbers of days.\n- A leap year has 12 months, with February having 29 days.\n- The first day of the year can be any day of the week.\n- The 13th day of each month is a specific day of the week depending on the starting day of the month.\n\nBut perhaps the key assumptions needed for the problem are:\n\n- A year is divided into 12 months.\n- Each month has at least 13 days (which is true for all months).\n- The days of the week repeat every 7 days.\n- The problem considers both common years (365 days) and leap years (366 days).\n\nWait, but the problem statement doesn't mention leap years, but since it says \"every year\", we must consider both. Therefore, the assumptions should cover both cases. So structuring the problem, the assumptions would list:\n\n- The Gregorian calendar is used.\n- A year has either 365 days (common year) or 366 days (leap year).\n- Each month has at least 13 days.\n- The days of the week cycle every 7 days.\n- The first day of the year can be any day of the week.\n\nBut perhaps each assumption should be a single line, applied to one object. Let's try:\n\nAssumption:\n- The calendar system is Gregorian.\n- A common year has 365 days.\n- A leap year has 366 days.\n- Each month in a common year has a fixed number of days (e.g., January has 31, February 28, etc.).\n- Each month in a leap year has a fixed number of days (February has 29).\n- The 13th day of each month is a specific date.\n- The days of the week repeat every 7 days.\n- The first day of the year is any day of the week.\n\nBut perhaps some of these are too detailed. The problem is to show that regardless of the starting day, there's always a Friday the 13th. So maybe the key assumption is that the year starts on any of the seven days, and the months have fixed lengths. So the problem reduces to showing that in any possible arrangement of days (with leap year considered), there must be a month where the 13th is a Friday.\n\nAlternatively, the problem can be approached by considering the modulo 7 shifts in the days as the months progress. For example, each month's starting day is offset by the number of days in the previous month modulo 7. So perhaps the assumptions needed are about the number of days in each month modulo 7 and how they affect the shift.\n\nBut according to the example, assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. Let me look again at the example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so why is \"n is divisible by 7\" an assumption? That seems contradictory. Unless perhaps there was a mistake in the example. Maybe the original problem had a different condition. Alternatively, maybe the example is incorrect, but the user provided it as an example. Regardless, for the current problem, the user wants to filter out unrelated information and structure the problem with assumptions.\n\nThe problem is \"Prove that every year has at least one Friday the 13th.\" The assumptions here are probably:\n\n- A year is a Gregorian year (common or leap).\n- The days of the week cycle every 7 days.\n- Each month has at least 13 days.\n\nBut perhaps more precise. For example, each month's length affects the shift in the starting day of the next month. So the number of days in each month modulo 7 affects the progression. Therefore, the problem's assumptions would include the fixed lengths of the months (for common and leap years) and the modulo 7 shifts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key assumption is that the 13th of each month can be mapped to a day of the week based on the starting day of the month, and that over the 12 months, the shifts cover all possibilities.\n\nBut to avoid overcomplicating, the necessary assumptions for the problem to hold are:\n\n- The calendar follows the Gregorian system with common and leap years.\n- Each month has a fixed number of days (January 31, February 28/29, etc.).\n- The days of the week repeat every 7 days.\n- The problem considers all possible starting days of the year (i.e., the year can start on any day of the week).\n\nTherefore, structuring the problem:\n\nAssumption:\n- The Gregorian calendar is used.\n- A year has 12 months with fixed numbers of days (common or leap year).\n- Each month has at least 13 days.\n- Days of the week repeat every 7 days.\n- The year can start on any day of the week.\n\nBut the example had two assumptions. Maybe here we need to list each assumption line by line. Let's try:\n\nAssumption:\n- The calendar system is Gregorian.\n- A common year has 365 days.\n- A leap year has 366 days.\n- Each month has a fixed number of days (common or leap year).\n- The days of the week cycle every 7 days.\n- The 13th day of a month occurs on a specific day of the week depending on the month's starting day.\n\nBut perhaps some of these can be combined. However, the user's example had each assumption as a separate line. Let me try to break them down into single-line assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\n- The problem considers Gregorian calendar years.\n- Each year is either a common year (365 days) or a leap year (366 days).\n- Each month in a common year has a known, fixed number of days.\n- Each month in a leap year has a known, fixed number of days (February has 29 days).\n- The 13th day of each month is considered.\n- Days of the week repeat every 7 days.\n- The first day of the year can be any day of the week.\n\nBut this might be too detailed. However, according to the example, assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. In the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are separate lines. So here, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- The calendar system is Gregorian.\n- A year has 12 months.\n- Each month has at least 13 days.\n- Days of the week cycle every 7 days.\n- The year can start on any day of the week.\n- Both common and leap years are considered.\n\nBut I need to ensure each assumption is one line and applies to one object. Perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- The calendar used is Gregorian.\n- Each year has 12 months.\n- Each month has a fixed number of days (common or leap year).\n- The 13th day of each month is a valid date.\n- Days of the week repeat every 7 days.\n- The first day of the year is any day of the week.\n\nBut maybe the key assumptions are that each month's length is fixed (for the purpose of calculating day shifts) and that the year can start on any day. The problem is to show that regardless of the starting day, there's at least one Friday the 13th. So perhaps the key assumptions are:\n\n- Each year has 12 months with fixed lengths (common or leap year).\n- Days of the week cycle every 7 days.\n- The first day of the year can be any day of the week.\n\nTherefore, structuring the problem:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption:\n- The calendar system is Gregorian.\n- Each year has 12 months with fixed numbers of days (common or leap year).\n- Days of the week repeat every 7 days.\n- The first day of the year can be any day of the week.\n\nProblem:\nProve that every year has at least one Friday the 13th.\n###END_OF_FORMAT###\n\nBut let's check if any assumptions are redundant. For example, \"fixed numbers of days\" is part of the Gregorian calendar, so maybe that's covered by the first assumption. However, to be explicit, it's better to list them separately. Also, the problem's source is from 2010 ISI B Math UGB, which might be using the Gregorian calendar by default, but since the problem is mathematical, perhaps the calendar system is an assumption. Alternatively, the problem could be approached abstractly without specifying the calendar, but given the problem statement, it's about real-world years, so Gregorian is necessary.\n\nAnother approach: The problem can be modeled by considering the possible configurations of month lengths and how the days shift. Therefore, the key assumptions are:\n\n- Each month has a fixed number of days (depending on common or leap year).\n- The days of the week cycle every 7 days.\n- The year starts on any of the seven possible days.\n\nThus, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- A year has 12 months with fixed lengths (common or leap year).\n- Days of the week repeat every 7 days.\n- The first day of the year can be any day of the week.\n\nProblem:\nProve that every year has at least one Friday the 13th.\n\nThis seems concise and captures the necessary conditions. The mention of common or leap year is important because February's length changes, affecting the day shifts. The fixed lengths are necessary to compute the modular shifts between months. The problem then reduces to showing that across all possible starting days and month lengths (common or leap), there's always at least one month where the 13th is a Friday.",
