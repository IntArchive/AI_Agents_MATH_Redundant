    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this integral problem. The user wants to prove that the integral from 0 to infinity of [ln(1+x) * arctan(sqrt(x))] divided by (4 + x²) dx equals (π/2) * arctan(1/2) * ln(5). Hmm, that looks pretty complex. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the integrand has three main components: ln(1+x), arctan(sqrt(x)), and the denominator 4 + x². The limits are from 0 to infinity. The answer involves pi, arctan(1/2), and ln(5), which suggests that maybe there's some substitution or identity that can simplify the product of ln and arctan into something more manageable.\n\nThe user mentioned possible methods like integration by parts, substitution, differentiation under the integral sign, power series, or contour integration. Let me think about each of these.\n\nIntegration by parts: Maybe we can set u = arctan(sqrt(x)) and dv = ln(1+x)/(4+x²) dx, but I'm not sure if that would simplify things. Alternatively, switching u and dv. But the product of ln and arctan might complicate things further.\n\nDifferentiation under the integral sign: This method often involves introducing a parameter into the integral, differentiating with respect to it, and then solving a differential equation. For example, maybe consider a parameter in the argument of ln(1+x) or arctan(sqrt(x)). But I need to see how that parameter would interact with the existing terms.\n\nSubstitution: Let's see. The denominator is 4 + x², which is similar to 1 + (x/2)². Maybe substituting t = x/2, so the denominator becomes 4(1 + t²). Then x = 2t, dx = 2dt. But then sqrt(x) becomes sqrt(2t), and ln(1+x) becomes ln(1 + 2t). Not sure if that helps immediately. Alternatively, maybe a substitution related to arctan(sqrt(x)). Let’s let u = sqrt(x), so x = u², dx = 2u du. Then the integral becomes [ln(1 + u²) * arctan(u) / (4 + u⁴)] * 2u du from 0 to infinity. Hmm, that seems more complicated. Maybe not the best route.\n\nPower series: Expanding ln(1+x) or arctan(sqrt(x)) into their Taylor series. For example, ln(1+x) = sum_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{n+1} x^n /n for |x| < 1. But since the integral is from 0 to infinity, the convergence might be an issue. Similarly, arctan(sqrt(x)) can be expanded as a power series for sqrt(x) < 1, i.e., x < 1, but beyond that, it diverges. So integrating term by term might not be straightforward.\n\nContour integration: This is a real integral from 0 to infinity, but maybe extending it to the complex plane. The denominator 4 + x² suggests poles at x = 2i and x = -2i. However, the numerator involves ln(1+x) and arctan(sqrt(x)), which are multivalued functions. It might require a keyhole contour or something similar, but I’m not sure how to handle the combination of log and arctan in the complex plane. This seems challenging.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe express arctan(sqrt(x)) as an integral itself. For instance, arctan(z) = integral from 0 to z of 1/(1 + t²) dt. So arctan(sqrt(x)) = integral from 0 to sqrt(x) of 1/(1 + t²) dt. Then switching the order of integration. Let me try that.\n\nSo the original integral becomes:\n\n∫₀^∞ [ln(1+x) / (4 + x²)] * [∫₀^√x 1/(1 + t²) dt] dx\n\nSwitching the order of integration. The limits for t are from 0 to sqrt(x), and x goes from 0 to ∞. So if we switch, x goes from t² to ∞, and t goes from 0 to ∞. So the integral becomes:\n\n∫₀^∞ [1/(1 + t²)] ∫_{x=t²}^∞ [ln(1+x)/(4 + x²)] dx dt\n\nNow, the inner integral is ∫_{t²}^∞ ln(1+x)/(4 + x²) dx. Maybe this can be expressed in terms of known integrals or differentiated with respect to t. Alternatively, perhaps another substitution here. Let x = y, so dx = dy, but not helpful. Maybe substitute x = sqrt(4) tanθ, which is 2 tanθ. Then x = 2 tanθ, dx = 2 sec²θ dθ. Then 4 + x² = 4(1 + tan²θ) = 4 sec²θ. So the inner integral becomes:\n\n∫_{θ= arctan(t²/2)}^{π/2} [ln(1 + 2 tanθ) / (4 sec²θ)] * 2 sec²θ dθ\n\nSimplifying, the 4 sec²θ in the denominator and 2 sec²θ from dx gives (2 sec²θ)/(4 sec²θ) = 1/2. So the inner integral becomes (1/2) ∫ arctan(t²/2) to π/2 of ln(1 + 2 tanθ) dθ. Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, consider differentiating with respect to a parameter. Let me think: Suppose we introduce a parameter k into the integral, say replacing 1+x with 1 + kx, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, think about the integral result involving ln(5) and arctan(1/2). Maybe the integral relates to some known constants or combinations.\n\nWait, the answer is (π/2) * arctan(1/2) * ln(5). Let me note that arctan(1/2) is an angle whose tangent is 1/2, and ln(5) is the natural log of 5. Maybe there's a substitution that connects 5 with the denominator 4 + x². Since 4 + 1 = 5, but not sure. Alternatively, perhaps substitution x = 2 tanθ, which would make the denominator 4 + x² = 4 sec²θ as before. Let me try that substitution for the original integral.\n\nLet x = 2 tanθ, so dx = 2 sec²θ dθ. When x=0, θ=0; x=∞, θ=π/2. Then the integral becomes:\n\n∫₀^{π/2} [ln(1 + 2 tanθ) * arctan(sqrt(2 tanθ)) / (4 + 4 tan²θ)] * 2 sec²θ dθ\n\nSimplify denominator: 4(1 + tan²θ) = 4 sec²θ. So denominator is 4 sec²θ. Then the integral becomes:\n\n∫₀^{π/2} [ln(1 + 2 tanθ) * arctan(sqrt(2 tanθ)) / (4 sec²θ)] * 2 sec²θ dθ\n\nThe 4 sec²θ in the denominator and 2 sec²θ from dx gives (2 sec²θ)/(4 sec²θ) = 1/2. So now the integral is (1/2) ∫₀^{π/2} ln(1 + 2 tanθ) * arctan(sqrt(2 tanθ)) dθ\n\nHmm, not sure if this is helpful yet. The arctan(sqrt(2 tanθ)) term is still complicated. Maybe another substitution inside. Let me set u = sqrt(2 tanθ). Then u² = 2 tanθ, so tanθ = u²/2, θ = arctan(u²/2). Then dθ = derivative of arctan(u²/2) with respect to u. Let's compute that:\n\ndθ/du = (1 / (1 + (u²/2)^2)) * (2u / 2) = (1 / (1 + u^4 /4)) * u = u / (1 + u^4 /4) = 4u / (4 + u^4)\n\nBut this substitution might complicate things further. Maybe not the right path.\n\nAlternatively, consider symmetry or substitution to reverse the integral limits. For example, substitute θ = π/2 - φ. But not sure.\n\nAnother idea: The presence of both ln(1+x) and arctan(sqrt(x)) suggests that perhaps expanding one of them as an integral or series. For example, ln(1+x) can be written as integral from 0 to1 of x/(1 + x s) ds. But I don't know if that helps here.\n\nWait, maybe Feynman's trick: Let’s consider a parameter a in place of 1 in ln(1+x), making it ln(a + x), and then differentiate with respect to a. But the original problem has a=1. Alternatively, set up a function I(a) = ∫₀^∞ [ln(a + x) arctan(sqrt(x)) / (4 + x²)] dx, then compute I'(a) = ∫₀^∞ [1/(a + x) * arctan(sqrt(x)) / (4 + x²)] dx. Maybe this derivative is easier to compute? Not sure, but perhaps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express arctan(sqrt(x)) as an integral. As I thought earlier, arctan(z) = ∫₀^z 1/(1 + t²) dt. So arctan(sqrt(x)) = ∫₀^{sqrt(x)} 1/(1 + t²) dt. Then substitute that into the original integral:\n\nI = ∫₀^∞ [ln(1+x) / (4 + x²)] * [∫₀^{sqrt(x)} 1/(1 + t²) dt] dx\n\nThen swap the order of integration. Let's visualize the region: t goes from 0 to sqrt(x), and x goes from 0 to ∞. If we swap, for each t ≥ 0, x goes from t² to ∞. So:\n\nI = ∫₀^∞ [1/(1 + t²)] ∫_{x=t²}^∞ [ln(1+x)/(4 + x²)] dx dt\n\nNow, the inner integral is ∫_{t²}^∞ ln(1+x)/(4 + x²) dx. Let me denote this inner integral as J(t). If we can find J(t), then I = ∫₀^∞ J(t)/(1 + t²) dt.\n\nSo how to compute J(t)? Maybe differentiation under the integral sign with respect to t. Let me think. Let’s set u = x, so J(t) = ∫_{t²}^∞ ln(1+u)/(4 + u²) du. Then dJ/dt = - ln(1 + t²)/(4 + t⁴) * 2t. But I'm not sure if this helps. Alternatively, integrating J(t) directly. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, consider substitution in J(t). Let u = x, so when x = t², u = t². Let’s make substitution y = u. Wait, not helpful. Maybe substitution y = u - t²? Not sure. Alternatively, substitution y = u / t², but that might complicate things.\n\nWait, maybe integrate J(t) by parts. Let me set v = ln(1 + u), dv = 1/(1 + u) du. Let dw = du/(4 + u²), then w = (1/2) arctan(u/2). So integration by parts gives:\n\nJ(t) = [ln(1 + u) * (1/2) arctan(u/2)] from u = t² to ∞ - ∫_{t²}^∞ (1/2) arctan(u/2) * [1/(1 + u)] du\n\nFirst term at infinity: ln(1 + u) grows logarithmically and arctan(u/2) approaches π/2, so the product tends to infinity? Wait, but we have a limit as u approaches infinity. So ln(1 + u) ~ ln(u), and arctan(u/2) ~ π/2. Therefore, the term at infinity would be like ln(u) * π/2, which goes to infinity. But our original integral J(t) is convergent because the integrand behaves like ln(u)/(u²) for large u, which is integrable. Therefore, integration by parts might not be valid here because the boundary term might diverge. Hmm, that suggests that integration by parts isn't the right approach here.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe express 1/(4 + x²) as an integral. Since 1/(4 + x²) = (1/4) / (1 + (x/2)^2) = (1/4) ∫₀^∞ e^{-(4 + x²)s} ds? Wait, no. Alternatively, use Laplace transform or Fourier transform, but that might be too vague.\n\nWait, another thought: The denominator 4 + x² can be written as (x + 2i)(x - 2i), so partial fractions. But since it's a real integral, maybe not helpful directly. Unless we use complex analysis, which brings me back to contour integration.\n\nAlternatively, consider substituting x = 2y. Then dx = 2 dy, and the integral becomes:\n\n∫₀^∞ [ln(1 + 2y) * arctan(sqrt(2y)) / (4 + 4y²)] * 2 dy\n\nSimplify denominator: 4(1 + y²). So integral becomes (2/4) ∫₀^∞ [ln(1 + 2y) * arctan(sqrt(2y)) / (1 + y²)] dy = (1/2) ∫₀^∞ [ln(1 + 2y) * arctan(sqrt(2y)) / (1 + y²)] dy\n\nStill not obviously helpful. The sqrt(2y) inside arctan is complicating. Let’s set z = sqrt(2y), so y = z²/2, dy = z dz. Then the integral becomes:\n\n(1/2) ∫₀^∞ [ln(1 + 2*(z²/2)) * arctan(z) / (1 + (z²/2)²)] * z dz\n\nSimplify inside ln: 1 + z². Denominator: 1 + (z^4)/4 = (4 + z^4)/4. So:\n\n(1/2) ∫₀^∞ [ln(1 + z²) * arctan(z) * z / ((4 + z^4)/4)] dz = (1/2)*(4) ∫₀^∞ [ln(1 + z²) * arctan(z) * z / (4 + z^4)] dz = 2 ∫₀^∞ [ln(1 + z²) * arctan(z) * z / (4 + z^4)] dz\n\nHmm, not sure if this helps. Now the integral is in terms of z, but the expression is still complicated. The presence of z^4 in the denominator might allow partial fractions, but it's a quartic. Maybe factor 4 + z^4. Let's see: z^4 + 4 = (z^2)^2 + (2)^2 = (z^2 + 2)^2 - (2z)^2 = (z^2 + 2z + 2)(z^2 - 2z + 2). So yes, it factors into (z² - 2z + 2)(z² + 2z + 2). So partial fractions might be possible. But integrating [ln(1 + z²) * arctan(z) * z] / [(z² - 2z + 2)(z² + 2z + 2)] dz seems daunting. Not sure if this leads anywhere.\n\nLet me think back to the answer: π/2 * arctan(1/2) * ln5. These constants suggest that maybe there are substitutions or transformations that can relate the integral to known integrals involving these constants. For example, arctan(1/2) might come from integrating something over a triangular region or from a substitution that introduces 1/2. ln5 could come from integrating 1/(x + 1) from 1 to 4, but not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe use substitution x = t^2 -1. Then when x goes from 0 to ∞, t goes from 1 to ∞. But then sqrt(x) = sqrt(t² -1), which complicates the arctan term. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let’s try differentiation under the integral sign. Let me define I(a) = ∫₀^∞ [ln(1 + a x) * arctan(sqrt(x)) / (4 + x²)] dx. Then, perhaps differentiate I(a) with respect to a. So I'(a) = ∫₀^∞ [x/(1 + a x) * arctan(sqrt(x)) / (4 + x²)] dx. But this seems more complicated. Maybe choosing a different parameter.\n\nAlternatively, let’s define I(b) = ∫₀^∞ [ln(1 + x) * arctan(b sqrt(x)) / (4 + x²)] dx. Then compute I(1). Differentiating I(b) with respect to b might give an integral involving the derivative of arctan(b sqrt(x)), which is [sqrt(x)/(1 + b² x)]. So I'(b) = ∫₀^∞ [ln(1 + x) * sqrt(x) / (1 + b² x) / (4 + x²)] dx. This might not be easier, but perhaps after differentiation, we can find a relation.\n\nAlternatively, consider expanding ln(1+x) as a power series. For x ≥ 0, ln(1+x) = ∫₀^1 x/(1 + x s) ds. Then substitute this into the integral:\n\nI = ∫₀^∞ [ ∫₀^1 x/(1 + x s) ds ] * arctan(sqrt(x)) / (4 + x²) dx\n\nSwap the order of integration:\n\nI = ∫₀^1 ∫₀^∞ [x/(1 + x s) * arctan(sqrt(x)) / (4 + x²)] dx ds\n\nNow, the inner integral is ∫₀^∞ [x arctan(sqrt(x)) / ( (1 + s x)(4 + x²) ) ] dx. Still complex, but maybe more manageable. Let’s denote this inner integral as K(s). If we can express K(s) in closed-form, then integrating over s from 0 to 1 would give the result.\n\nAlternatively, consider substitution in K(s): Let t = sqrt(x), so x = t², dx = 2t dt. Then:\n\nK(s) = ∫₀^∞ [ t² * arctan(t) / ( (1 + s t²)(4 + t⁴) ) ] * 2t dt = 2 ∫₀^∞ [ t³ arctan(t) / ( (1 + s t²)(4 + t⁴) ) ] dt\n\nHmm, still complicated. But maybe express 1/( (1 + s t²)(4 + t⁴) ) using partial fractions. However, partial fractions for a quartic denominator might be messy. Alternatively, note that 4 + t⁴ = (t² + 2t + 2)(t² - 2t + 2), as before. Then:\n\n1 / ( (1 + s t²)(t² + 2t + 2)(t² - 2t + 2) )\n\nThis seems quite involved. Perhaps this approach is not the most efficient.\n\nLet me think of another idea. The presence of both ln(1+x) and arctan(sqrt(x)) might suggest using substitution involving both terms. For example, let’s set u = sqrt(x), so x = u², dx = 2u du. Then the integral becomes:\n\n∫₀^∞ [ln(1 + u²) * arctan(u) / (4 + u⁴) ] * 2u du = 2 ∫₀^∞ [u ln(1 + u²) arctan(u) / (4 + u⁴) ] du\n\nStill not straightforward, but maybe integrating by parts here. Let me set v = arctan(u), dv = 1/(1 + u²) du. Let dw = [u ln(1 + u²) / (4 + u⁴) ] du. Then we need to find w. This seems complicated. Alternatively, set v = ln(1 + u²), dv = 2u/(1 + u²) du, and dw = arctan(u) * u / (4 + u⁴) du. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, expand arctan(u) as a power series. Since arctan(u) = ∑_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n u^{2n+1}/(2n+1) for |u| ≤ 1, but the integral is from 0 to ∞, so this would only converge up to u=1. But maybe split the integral into two parts: from 0 to 1 and from 1 to ∞. For the second part, substitute u = 1/t, then:\n\n∫₁^∞ [u ln(1 + u²) arctan(u) / (4 + u⁴) ] du = ∫₀^1 [ (1/t) ln(1 + 1/t²) arctan(1/t) / (4 + 1/t⁴) ] * (1/t²) dt\n\nSimplify this expression: Let's compute each part. 1/t * ln(1 + 1/t²) = (1/t) ln((t² + 1)/t²) = (1/t)(ln(t² + 1) - 2 ln t). arctan(1/t) = π/2 - arctan(t) for t > 0. The denominator 4 + 1/t⁴ = (4 t⁴ + 1)/t⁴. So the integral becomes:\n\n∫₀^1 [ (1/t)(ln(t² +1) - 2 ln t) * (π/2 - arctan(t)) / ( (4 t⁴ + 1)/t⁴ ) ] * (1/t²) dt\n\nSimplifying the denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by t⁴, so denominator is 4 t⁴ +1. The entire expression becomes:\n\n∫₀^1 [ (1/t)(ln(t² +1) - 2 ln t) * (π/2 - arctan(t)) * t⁴ / (4 t⁴ +1) ] * (1/t²) dt\n\nSimplify the terms:\n\n(1/t) * t⁴ = t³,\n\nThen multiply by 1/t²: t³ / t² = t.\n\nSo integral becomes:\n\n∫₀^1 [ (ln(t² +1) - 2 ln t) * (π/2 - arctan(t)) * t / (4 t⁴ +1) ] dt\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe combining with the original integral from 0 to1. However, I don't see an immediate simplification here.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe consider the substitution related to 4 + x². Let’s set x = 2 tanφ, as before, but maybe with a different purpose. Wait, x = 2 tanφ, dx = 2 sec²φ dφ. Then 4 + x² = 4 sec²φ. The integral becomes:\n\n∫₀^{π/2} [ln(1 + 2 tanφ) * arctan(sqrt(2 tanφ)) / (4 sec²φ) ] * 2 sec²φ dφ\n\nSimplify: 4 sec²φ in denominator and 2 sec²φ in numerator gives (2 sec²φ)/(4 sec²φ) = 1/2. So integral becomes (1/2) ∫₀^{π/2} ln(1 + 2 tanφ) * arctan(sqrt(2 tanφ)) dφ\n\nStill complicated. Maybe this suggests a substitution in the trigonometric integral. Let’s set sqrt(2 tanφ) = t. Then 2 tanφ = t², so tanφ = t²/2. Then φ = arctan(t²/2). Then dφ = ( derivative of arctan(t²/2) ) dt = ( (t/ ( (t^4)/4 + 1 ) ) dt ). Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use beta function or gamma function properties, but I don’t see a direct connection.\n\nAlternatively, check if the integral can be related to known integrals. For example, integrals involving ln(1+x) and arctan terms. Maybe look for symmetry or substitution that combines both terms.\n\nWait, the answer has arctan(1/2) and ln5. Let's recall that arctan(1/2) + arctan(2) = π/2. Also, ln5 is the natural logarithm of 5. Maybe there's a substitution that inverts the argument or relates to these constants.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe split the original integral into two parts. For example, use the property that ln(1+x) = ln( (x +1)/x * x ) = ln(x +1) - ln x. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider differentiating with respect to a parameter inside the integral. Let's suppose we define I(a) = ∫₀^∞ [ln(1 + a x) arctan(sqrt(x)) / (4 + x²) ] dx. Then, compute I(1). Differentiating I(a) with respect to a gives I'(a) = ∫₀^∞ [x/(1 + a x) * arctan(sqrt(x)) / (4 + x²) ] dx. If we set a=1, we get I'(1). But not sure if this helps.\n\nAlternatively, introduce a parameter in the arctan term. Let’s define I(b) = ∫₀^∞ [ln(1+x) arctan(b sqrt(x)) / (4 + x²) ] dx. Then differentiate I(b) with respect to b:\n\nI’(b) = ∫₀^∞ [ln(1+x) * (sqrt(x)/(1 + b² x)) / (4 + x²) ] dx\n\nThis seems similar to the previous differentiation idea, but still complex. However, maybe if we set b=1, then I’(1) would be part of the expression. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider the substitution t = sqrt(x). Then x = t², dx = 2t dt. Then the integral becomes:\n\n∫₀^∞ [ln(1 + t²) * arctan(t) / (4 + t⁴) ] * 2t dt = 2 ∫₀^∞ [t ln(1 + t²) arctan(t) / (4 + t⁴) ] dt\n\nThis is similar to what I had before. Maybe express 4 + t⁴ as (t² + 2t + 2)(t² - 2t + 2). Then partial fractions decomposition. Let’s try that.\n\nSo, 4 + t⁴ = (t² + 2t + 2)(t² - 2t + 2). Let’s write:\n\n1/(4 + t⁴) = (A t + B)/(t² + 2t + 2) + (C t + D)/(t² - 2t + 2)\n\nMultiply both sides by (4 + t⁴):\n\n1 = (A t + B)(t² - 2t + 2) + (C t + D)(t² + 2t + 2)\n\nExpand the right-hand side:\n\n(A t + B)(t² - 2t + 2) = A t³ - 2A t² + 2A t + B t² - 2B t + 2B\n\nSimilarly, (C t + D)(t² + 2t + 2) = C t³ + 2C t² + 2C t + D t² + 2D t + 2D\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nt³: (A + C) t³\n\nt²: (-2A + B + 2C + D) t²\n\nt: (2A - 2B + 2C + 2D) t\n\nconstants: (2B + 2D)\n\nSet equal to 1 = 0 t³ + 0 t² + 0 t + 1. Therefore, we have the system:\n\nA + C = 0\n\n-2A + B + 2C + D = 0\n\n2A - 2B + 2C + 2D = 0\n\n2B + 2D = 1\n\nFrom first equation: C = -A\n\nSubstitute C = -A into second equation:\n\n-2A + B + 2(-A) + D = 0 => -2A + B - 2A + D = 0 => -4A + B + D = 0\n\nThird equation:\n\n2A - 2B + 2(-A) + 2D = 0 => 2A - 2B - 2A + 2D = 0 => -2B + 2D = 0 => -B + D = 0 => D = B\n\nFourth equation:\n\n2B + 2D = 1. But D = B, so 2B + 2B = 1 => 4B = 1 => B = 1/4, then D = 1/4.\n\nSubstitute B = 1/4, D = 1/4 into second equation: -4A + 1/4 + 1/4 = 0 => -4A + 1/2 = 0 => A = (1/2)/4 = 1/8. Then C = -1/8.\n\nTherefore, partial fractions decomposition is:\n\n1/(4 + t⁴) = ( (1/8 t + 1/4) / (t² + 2t + 2) ) + ( (-1/8 t + 1/4) / (t² - 2t + 2) )\n\nSimplify:\n\n= [ (t + 2) / 8 ] / (t² + 2t + 2) + [ (-t + 2) / 8 ] / (t² - 2t + 2)\n\nTherefore,\n\n1/(4 + t⁴) = (t + 2)/(8(t² + 2t + 2)) + (-t + 2)/(8(t² - 2t + 2))\n\nSo now, the integral becomes:\n\n2 ∫₀^∞ [t ln(1 + t²) arctan(t) ] * [ (t + 2)/(8(t² + 2t + 2)) + (-t + 2)/(8(t² - 2t + 2)) ] dt\n\nFactor out the 1/8:\n\n2*(1/8) ∫₀^∞ [t ln(1 + t²) arctan(t) ] [ (t + 2)/(t² + 2t + 2) + (-t + 2)/(t² - 2t + 2) ] dt\n\nSimplify 2/8 = 1/4:\n\n(1/4) [ ∫₀^∞ t (t + 2) ln(1 + t²) arctan(t) / (t² + 2t + 2) dt + ∫₀^∞ t (-t + 2) ln(1 + t²) arctan(t) / (t² - 2t + 2) dt ]\n\nLet’s denote the two integrals as I1 and I2.\n\nI1 = ∫₀^∞ [t (t + 2) ln(1 + t²) arctan(t) ] / (t² + 2t + 2) dt\n\nI2 = ∫₀^∞ [t (-t + 2) ln(1 + t²) arctan(t) ] / (t² - 2t + 2) dt\n\nLet’s examine I1 first. The denominator is t² + 2t + 2 = (t + 1)^2 +1. The numerator is t(t + 2) ln(1 + t²) arctan(t). Let’s write t(t + 2) = t² + 2t. Notice that denominator is t² + 2t + 2 = numerator + 2. So, perhaps split into numerator and denominator:\n\nI1 = ∫₀^∞ [ (t² + 2t) / (t² + 2t + 2) ] ln(1 + t²) arctan(t) dt\n\n= ∫₀^∞ [1 - 2/(t² + 2t + 2) ] ln(1 + t²) arctan(t) dt\n\n= ∫₀^∞ ln(1 + t²) arctan(t) dt - 2 ∫₀^∞ [ ln(1 + t²) arctan(t) / (t² + 2t + 2) ] dt\n\nSimilarly for I2:\n\nI2 = ∫₀^∞ [ -t² + 2t ] / (t² - 2t + 2) ln(1 + t²) arctan(t) dt\n\nDenominator t² - 2t + 2 = (t -1)^2 +1. Numerator -t² +2t = - (t² -2t) = - [ (t² -2t + 2) - 2 ] = - (denominator - 2). So:\n\nI2 = ∫₀^∞ [ - ( (t² -2t + 2) - 2 ) / (t² -2t + 2) ] ln(1 + t²) arctan(t) dt\n\n= ∫₀^∞ [ -1 + 2/(t² -2t + 2) ] ln(1 + t²) arctan(t) dt\n\n= - ∫₀^∞ ln(1 + t²) arctan(t) dt + 2 ∫₀^∞ [ ln(1 + t²) arctan(t) / (t² -2t + 2) ] dt\n\nNow, substituting back into the expression for the original integral:\n\n(1/4)( I1 + I2 ) = (1/4)[ (I1 + I2) ]\n\nPlugging I1 and I2:\n\n= (1/4)[ (A - 2B) + (-A + 2C) ) ]\n\nWhere A = ∫₀^∞ ln(1 + t²) arctan(t) dt\n\nB = ∫₀^∞ [ ln(1 + t²) arctan(t) / (t² + 2t + 2) ] dt\n\nC = ∫₀^∞ [ ln(1 + t²) arctan(t) / (t² -2t + 2) ] dt\n\nSo combining:\n\n(1/4)[ (A -2B -A + 2C) ] = (1/4)[ -2B + 2C ] = (1/4)( -2(B - C) ) = - (B - C)/2\n\nSo the original integral becomes - (B - C)/2. Therefore, we need to compute B - C.\n\nBut B and C are:\n\nB = ∫₀^∞ [ ln(1 + t²) arctan(t) / (t² + 2t + 2) ] dt\n\nC = ∫₀^∞ [ ln(1 + t²) arctan(t) / (t² -2t + 2) ] dt\n\nNotice that C can be rewritten with substitution u = t + something. Let’s try to relate B and C.\n\nIn C, the denominator is t² -2t +2. Let’s make substitution u = t -1. Then t = u +1, dt = du. When t=0, u=-1; t=∞, u=∞. So:\n\nC = ∫_{-1}^∞ [ ln(1 + (u +1)^2) arctan(u +1) / ( (u +1)^2 -2(u +1) + 2 ) ] du\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n(u +1)^2 -2(u +1) +2 = u² + 2u +1 -2u -2 +2 = u² +1\n\nSo C = ∫_{-1}^∞ [ ln(1 + (u +1)^2) arctan(u +1) / (u² +1) ] du\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe split the integral into two parts: from -1 to 0 and from 0 to ∞.\n\nC = ∫_{-1}^0 [ ... ] du + ∫₀^∞ [ ... ] du\n\nIn the first part, u from -1 to 0, substitute v = -u. Not sure if helpful.\n\nAlternatively, in the expression for B, denominator t² + 2t +2 = (t +1)^2 +1. Let’s make substitution s = t +1. Then t = s -1, dt = ds. When t=0, s=1; t=∞, s=∞. So:\n\nB = ∫₁^∞ [ ln(1 + (s -1)^2) arctan(s -1) / (s² +1) ] ds\n\nAgain, complicated.\n\nAlternatively, note that B and C might be related through another substitution. For example, in B, substitute w = t +1, but not obviously helpful.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the integrals B and C might be expressible in terms of each other through substitution. Let’s check.\n\nIn B: denominator t² + 2t +2. Let’s substitute t = -y -2. Then dt = -dy. When t=0, y=-2; t=∞, y=-∞. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, substitute t = 1/z in B:\n\nt = 1/z, dt = -1/z² dz. When t=0, z=∞; t=∞, z=0. Then:\n\nB = ∫₀^∞ [ ln(1 + (1/z)^2) arctan(1/z) / ( (1/z)^2 + 2*(1/z) + 2 ) ] * (-1/z²) dz\n\nSimplify:\n\nln(1 + 1/z²) = ln( (z² +1)/z² ) = ln(z² +1) - 2 ln z\n\narctan(1/z) = π/2 - arctan(z) for z >0\n\nDenominator: 1/z² + 2/z +2 = (1 + 2z + 2 z²)/z²\n\nSo:\n\nB = ∫∞^0 [ (ln(z² +1) - 2 ln z) * (π/2 - arctan(z)) / ( (1 + 2z + 2 z²)/z² ) ] * (-1/z²) dz\n\nThe negative sign flips the limits:\n\nB = ∫₀^∞ [ (ln(z² +1) - 2 ln z) * (π/2 - arctan(z)) * z² / (1 + 2z + 2 z²) ) * (1/z²) dz\n\nSimplify:\n\nz² / z² = 1, and the integrand becomes:\n\n[ (ln(z² +1) - 2 ln z) * (π/2 - arctan(z)) / (1 + 2z + 2 z²) ] dz\n\nBut this doesn’t seem to directly relate to C.\n\nAt this point, I realize that this approach is getting too convoluted and perhaps there's a smarter substitution or method that I’m missing. Let me try to think differently.\n\nWait, the answer has ln5. That might come from integrating something that results in ln(5) due to substitution limits. For example, if somewhere we have an integral that evaluates to ln(5) by having a term like 1/(x +1) from 0 to4, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider evaluating the integral numerically to check the answer. Let me approximate the integral:\n\n∫₀^∞ [ln(1+x) arctan(sqrt(x)) / (4 +x²) ] dx\n\nLet’s make substitution x = t² to transform it to:\n\n∫₀^∞ [ln(1 + t²) arctan(t) / (4 + t⁴) ] 2t dt\n\nBut this might not help in numerical approximation. Alternatively, use a calculator or approximate methods, but since I don't have one here, maybe recall that the answer is (π/2) arctan(1/2) ln5.\n\nCompute π/2 ≈ 1.5708, arctan(1/2) ≈ 0.4636, ln5 ≈1.6094. Multiply them together: 1.5708 * 0.4636 ≈0.7296; 0.7296 *1.6094≈1.174. So the integral should evaluate to approximately 1.174.\n\nIf I can approximate the original integral numerically, maybe check if this is plausible. For example, consider the behavior of the integrand:\n\nFor x near 0: ln(1+x) ~x, arctan(sqrt(x)) ~sqrt(x), so integrand ~x * sqrt(x)/(4) ~x^(3/2)/4, which is integrable at 0.\n\nFor x large: ln(1+x) ~ lnx, arctan(sqrt(x)) ~π/2, denominator ~x². So integrand ~ (lnx * π/2)/x² ~ (lnx)/x², which is integrable at infinity.\n\nTherefore, the integral converges and the value around 1.174 seems possible.\n\nBut how to connect this to the given constants? Maybe consider known integrals involving arctan and log functions. \n\nAnother idea: Let’s consider writing arctan(sqrt(x)) as an integral:\n\narctan(sqrt(x)) = ∫₀^sqrt(x) 1/(1 + t²) dt\n\nThen substitute into the original integral:\n\nI = ∫₀^∞ [ln(1+x) / (4 +x²)] * [∫₀^sqrt(x) 1/(1 + t²) dt] dx\n\nSwap the order of integration. The region is t from 0 to sqrt(x), x from 0 to ∞. So, swapping gives x from t² to ∞, t from 0 to ∞.\n\nThus:\n\nI = ∫₀^∞ [1/(1 + t²) ∫_{t²}^∞ ln(1+x)/(4 +x²) dx ] dt\n\nLet’s denote the inner integral as J(t) = ∫_{t²}^∞ ln(1+x)/(4 +x²) dx\n\nIf we can evaluate J(t), then I = ∫₀^∞ J(t)/(1 + t²) dt\n\nLet’s try to compute J(t). Make substitution x = 2 tanθ, dx = 2 sec²θ dθ. When x = t², θ = arctan(t²/2); x = ∞, θ = π/2.\n\nThus,\n\nJ(t) = ∫_{arctan(t²/2)}^{π/2} ln(1 + 2 tanθ) / (4 sec²θ) * 2 sec²θ dθ\n\nSimplify: 4 sec²θ in denominator and 2 sec²θ in numerator gives 2/4 = 1/2. So:\n\nJ(t) = (1/2) ∫_{arctan(t²/2)}^{π/2} ln(1 + 2 tanθ) dθ\n\nNow, substitute φ = π/2 - θ. When θ = arctan(t²/2), φ = π/2 - arctan(t²/2) = arctan(2/t²). When θ = π/2, φ =0. Then dθ = -dφ.\n\nSo,\n\nJ(t) = (1/2) ∫₀^{arctan(2/t²)} ln(1 + 2 tan(π/2 - φ)) (-dφ)\n\n= (1/2) ∫₀^{arctan(2/t²)} ln(1 + 2 cotφ) dφ\n\nBecause tan(π/2 - φ) = cotφ.\n\nSo,\n\nJ(t) = (1/2) ∫₀^{arctan(2/t²)} ln(1 + 2 cotφ) dφ\n\nHmm, cotφ = cosφ/sinφ. So 1 + 2 cotφ = 1 + 2 cosφ/sinφ = (sinφ + 2 cosφ)/sinφ.\n\nThus,\n\nln(1 + 2 cotφ) = ln(sinφ + 2 cosφ) - ln sinφ\n\nSo,\n\nJ(t) = (1/2) ∫₀^{arctan(2/t²)} [ln(sinφ + 2 cosφ) - ln sinφ ] dφ\n\n= (1/2) [ ∫₀^{arctan(2/t²)} ln(sinφ + 2 cosφ) dφ - ∫₀^{arctan(2/t²)} ln sinφ dφ ]\n\nThe second integral, ∫ ln sinφ dφ, is a known integral and equals - (π/2) ln2 near certain limits, but not sure here. Let’s denote the upper limit as α = arctan(2/t²). Maybe we can express these integrals in terms of α.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Let me think if there’s a substitution that can simplify the first integral. Let’s consider sinφ + 2 cosφ. This can be written as R sin(φ + δ), where R = sqrt(1 + 4) = sqrt(5), and δ = arctan(2/1) = arctan(2). So:\n\nsinφ + 2 cosφ = sqrt(5) sin(φ + arctan(2))\n\nTherefore,\n\nln(sinφ + 2 cosφ) = ln(sqrt(5)) + ln sin(φ + arctan(2))\n\nThus,\n\n∫₀^{α} ln(sinφ + 2 cosφ) dφ = ∫₀^{α} [ (1/2) ln5 + ln sin(φ + arctan(2)) ] dφ\n\n= (1/2) ln5 * α + ∫₀^{α} ln sin(φ + arctan(2)) dφ\n\n= (1/2) ln5 * α + ∫_{arctan(2)}^{α + arctan(2)} ln sinψ dψ (where ψ = φ + arctan(2))\n\nThe integral ∫ ln sinψ dψ from a to b is a standard integral, but it doesn't have a elementary closed-form. However, over intervals of π, it relates to the  what's known as the Clausen functions, but I’m not sure.\n\nTherefore, J(t) becomes:\n\nJ(t) = (1/2)[ (1/2 ln5) α + ∫_{arctan(2)}^{α + arctan(2)} ln sinψ dψ - ∫₀^{α} ln sinφ dφ ]\n\nBut this is getting too involved and doesn't seem to lead to an obvious solution. Perhaps I need to take a different approach.\n\nWait, going back to the original answer: π/2 * arctan(1/2) * ln5. Let me note that π/2 comes from an integral involving arctan or from the limits of integration. arctan(1/2) might come from evaluating some angle, and ln5 from integrating 1/(x +1) from 0 to 4 or similar.\n\nAlternatively, consider the substitution x = 2 tanθ, which makes the denominator 4 + x² = 4 sec²θ. Let's try that again:\n\nx = 2 tanθ, dx = 2 sec²θ dθ. The integral becomes:\n\n∫₀^{π/2} [ln(1 + 2 tanθ) * arctan(sqrt(2 tanθ)) / (4 sec²θ) ] * 2 sec²θ dθ\n\nSimplify: 4 sec²θ in denominator and 2 sec²θ in numerator gives (2 sec²θ)/(4 sec²θ) = 1/2. So:\n\nI = (1/2) ∫₀^{π/2} ln(1 + 2 tanθ) * arctan(sqrt(2 tanθ)) dθ\n\nNow, let’s set φ = sqrt(2 tanθ). Then tanθ = φ²/2, θ = arctan(φ²/2), dθ = (2φ)/(φ⁴ + 4) dφ. Wait, let's compute dθ:\n\ntanθ = φ²/2 => θ = arctan(φ²/2)\n\nDifferentiate both sides: sec²θ dθ = (2φ)/2 dφ => dθ = (φ dφ)/sec²θ\n\nBut sec²θ = 1 + tan²θ = 1 + φ⁴/4. So:\n\ndθ = (φ dφ) / (1 + φ⁴/4) = (4φ dφ)/(4 + φ⁴)\n\nBut when θ goes from 0 to π/2, φ = sqrt(2 tanθ) goes from 0 to ∞. So substitution φ from 0 to ∞.\n\nThus, the integral becomes:\n\nI = (1/2) ∫₀^∞ ln(1 + 2*(φ²/2)) * arctan(φ) * (4φ dφ)/(4 + φ⁴)\n\nSimplify inside ln: 1 + φ². So:\n\nI = (1/2) * 4 ∫₀^∞ [ln(1 + φ²) * arctan(φ) * φ / (4 + φ⁴) ] dφ\n\n= 2 ∫₀^∞ [φ ln(1 + φ²) arctan(φ) / (4 + φ⁴) ] dφ\n\nWait, this is the same as the integral after substitution x = sqrt(x). Which means we’re going in circles. This indicates that maybe there's a symmetry or substitution that I'm missing here.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the integrand in terms of φ is similar to the original integrand, suggesting that this integral might be related to itself. However, without a clear parameter to exploit, this is not helpful.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to look for a smarter substitution or recognize a pattern that leads to the result. Since the answer includes arctan(1/2), which is the angle for a right triangle with opposite side 1 and adjacent side 2, perhaps a substitution related to such a triangle.\n\nAnother approach: Let’s consider integrating with respect to x and then switching variables or using a substitution that involves the constants 1/2 and 5.\n\nWait, the denominator is 4 +x² = (x - 2i)(x + 2i). Maybe using contour integration in the complex plane. Consider the integral:\n\n∫_{-∞}^∞ [ln(1 + x) arctan(sqrt(x)) / (4 +x²) ] dx\n\nBut the original integral is from 0 to ∞. The function arctan(sqrt(x)) is real for x ≥0, but sqrt(x) is not defined for x <0. So maybe consider even or odd extensions. However, since the original integrand is only defined for x ≥0, contour integration might not be straightforward. Also, the presence of branch cuts due to sqrt(x) and ln(1+x) complicates things.\n\nHowever, perhaps consider a keyhole contour to avoid the branch cut on the positive real axis. Let me try sketching this:\n\nThe function has branch points at x=0 (due to sqrt(x)) and x=-1 (due to ln(1+x)). The denominator has poles at x=2i and x=-2i. To compute the integral from 0 to ∞, we can consider the contour that goes from ε to R, around the large circle, back from R to ε on the other side of the branch cut, and around a small circle at 0. However, this requires careful handling of the branch cuts for both ln(1+x) and sqrt(x).\n\nAlternatively, since sqrt(x) is analytic on the positive real axis, and the original integral is from 0 to ∞, maybe consider closing the contour in the upper half-plane, enclosing the pole at 2i. However, the integrand isn’t even or odd, so the whole real line integral isn't directly helpful.\n\nBut let’s try. Let’s denote f(z) = ln(1+z) arctan(sqrt(z)) / (4 + z²). We need to evaluate ∫₀^∞ f(z) dz. To use contour integration, we might relate it to ∫_{-∞}^∞ f(z) dz, but f(z) isn’t defined for negative real z.\n\nAlternatively, consider substituting z = t², making the integral:\n\n∫₀^∞ [ln(1 + t²) arctan(t) / (4 + t⁴) ] 2t dt\n\nThis is similar to previous substitutions. Then, consider the complex integral ∫_{C} [ln(1 + z²) arctan(z) / (4 + z⁴) ] 2z dz, where C is a contour that includes the positive real axis and a large semicircle in the upper half-plane. The poles of the denominator are at z = √2 e^{iπ/4}, z = √2 e^{3iπ/4}, z = √2 e^{5iπ/4}, z = √2 e^{7iπ/4}. The arctan(z) and ln(1 + z²) introduce branch cuts. This seems very complicated and likely requires advanced techniques beyond basic contour integration.\n\nGiven the time I’ve spent without success, perhaps it's best to look for a substitution or identity that directly connects the integral to the given result. For example, recognizing that the integral can be split into products of simpler integrals, but the presence of both ln and arctan makes this unlikely.\n\nWait, the answer has a product of three terms: π/2, arctan(1/2), and ln5. This suggests that the integral factors into three separate integrals or that each term comes from a different part of the calculation. For instance, π/2 might come from integrating over theta from 0 to pi/2, arctan(1/2) from some substitution involving 1/2, and ln5 from integrating a rational function resulting in log terms.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe use the substitution x = (2(t -1))/(1 + t), which can sometimes rationalize certain integrals, but this is a shot in the dark.\n\nAlternatively, consider expanding arctan(sqrt(x)) as a power series and integrating term by term. For example, arctan(z) = ∫₀^z 1/(1 + t²) dt, but then integrating term by term.\n\nWait, here's an idea: Use the integral representation of arctan(sqrt(x)):\n\narctan(sqrt(x)) = ∫₀^1 sqrt(x)/(1 + x t²) dt\n\nThen substitute this into the original integral:\n\nI = ∫₀^∞ [ln(",
