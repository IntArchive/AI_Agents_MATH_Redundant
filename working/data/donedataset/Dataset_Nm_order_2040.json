    "Content": "Prove that the determinant of an upper triangular matrix is the\nproduct of its diagonal entries. What I have so far: We will prove this by induction for an $n \\times n$ matrix. For the case of a $2 \\times 2$ matrix, let $A= \\left( \\begin{array}{cc}\na_{11} & a_{12} \\\\\n0 & a_{22}  \\end{array} \\right)$ . So $\\det(A)=a_{11}a_{22}$ and the statement is true for the case of a $2 \\times 2$ matrix. Now suppose that this statement is true for an $n \\times n$ matrix. We will show that it also is true for an $(n + 1) \\times (n + 1)$ matrix. Let $A = \\left( \\begin{array}{ccc}\na_{11} & a_{12} & \\cdots & a_{1(n+1)}\\\\\n0 & a_{22} & \\cdots & a_{2(n+1)} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\cdots &  & \\vdots\\\\\n0 & 0 & \\cdots & a_{(n+1)(n+1)}\\end{array} \\right)$ . I don't know what to do after this.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Using the cofactor expansion along the first column we get \n$$|A|=(-1)^{1+1}a_{11} \\left |\\begin{matrix} a_{22}&a_{23} & \\cdots & a_{2(n+1)} \\\\\n                                 0 &a_{33} & \\cdots & a_{3(n+1)} \\\\\n                                \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\\n                                0 & 0 & 0 & a_{n+1n+1}\n                 \\end{matrix}\\right |$$ (Note that remaining terms in the expansion are zero.)

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The task is to prove that the determinant of an upper triangular matrix is the product of its diagonal entries. The user has started an induction proof and is stuck on the inductive step for an (n+1)×(n+1) matrix.\n\nFirst, let me recall what an upper triangular matrix is. It's a square matrix where all the entries below the main diagonal are zero. So for any entry a_ij where i > j, a_ij = 0. The determinant of such a matrix should be the product of the diagonal elements a_11, a_22, ..., a_nn.\n\nThe user has correctly handled the base case for a 2×2 matrix. For a 2x2 upper triangular matrix, the determinant is indeed a_11 * a_22, which matches the product of the diagonal entries. Now, they're trying to use induction, assuming it's true for an n×n matrix and then proving it for (n+1)×(n+1).\n\nThe problem arises in the inductive step. Let's think about how induction works here. Suppose the statement holds for all n×n upper triangular matrices. Now, consider an (n+1)×(n+1) upper triangular matrix A. To compute the determinant, one common method is to expand along the first row (or any row/column with zeros to simplify calculation). However, in the case of an upper triangular matrix, expanding along the first column might be more efficient because there's only one non-zero entry in the first column (the first element a_11), followed by zeros.\n\nLet me structure the matrix A as follows:\n\nA = [a_11, a_12, ..., a_1(n+1)\n      0, a_22, ..., a_2(n+1)\n      ...\n      0, 0, ..., a_(n+1)(n+1)]\n\nIf I expand the determinant along the first column, the only non-zero entry is a_11. The determinant would then be a_11 multiplied by the determinant of the minor matrix obtained by removing the first row and first column. This minor matrix is itself an n×n upper triangular matrix with diagonal entries a_22, a_33, ..., a_(n+1)(n+1). By the induction hypothesis, the determinant of this minor is the product of its diagonal entries. Therefore, the determinant of A would be a_11 times the product of a_22 to a_(n+1)(n+1), which is exactly the product of all diagonal entries of A.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned they were stuck after writing down the matrix. Maybe they didn't consider expanding along the first column. Alternatively, expanding along the first row could also work, but then they would have to deal with more minors. However, since the matrix is upper triangular, expanding along the first column is more straightforward because of the zeros.\n\nAnother way to think about it is using row operations. The determinant is unaffected by row operations that add a multiple of one row to another. But since the matrix is already upper triangular, perhaps that's not necessary here. The key point is leveraging the induction hypothesis by recognizing the structure of the minor matrix after expansion.\n\nSo the critical step is choosing the correct row or column to expand the determinant, which simplifies the problem using the induction hypothesis. The first column is ideal here because of the zeros below a_11.\n\nTherefore, the user needs to perform the expansion along the first column, apply the induction hypothesis to the minor, and conclude the proof.",
