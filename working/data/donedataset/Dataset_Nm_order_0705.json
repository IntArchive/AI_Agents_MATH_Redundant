    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is to prove that |e^{iθ} - 1| ≤ |θ|. \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The example given had assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So each assumption should be a single condition on one object.\n\nLooking at the problem here: the variable is θ. The expression involves e^{iθ}, which suggests θ is a real number because complex exponentials are typically parameterized by real angles. Also, the inequality involves |θ|, which is the absolute value, so θ should be a real number. Therefore, the main assumption here is that θ is a real number. Are there any other implicit assumptions? The original problem statement doesn't mention any restrictions on θ, like being in a certain interval, so maybe that's the only assumption.\n\nWait, but sometimes in these proofs, especially involving trigonometric identities or inequalities, θ is often considered in radians. If θ is in radians, then the inequality |e^{iθ} - 1| ≤ |θ| holds. If θ were in degrees, the inequality might not hold without conversion. However, in mathematical contexts, especially involving calculus, angles are usually assumed to be in radians unless stated otherwise. So maybe the assumption is that θ is a real number measured in radians. But the problem doesn't explicitly state that. Hmm. The user's example didn't include units, just properties. So perhaps the key assumption is θ is a real number. Because the problem as stated doesn't restrict θ to any range, but the inequality is valid for all real θ. Wait, is that true? Let me check.\n\nThe inequality |e^{iθ} - 1| ≤ |θ| is actually true for all real θ. Because |e^{iθ} - 1| is the chord length between points 1 and e^{iθ} on the unit circle, and |θ| is the arc length between them. The chord length is always less than or equal to the arc length. So the key assumption is that θ is a real number. There's no need to mention radians here because θ is just a real number, and the result holds for all real numbers. Therefore, the only assumption is that θ is a real number.\n\nSo the assumptions would be: θ is a real number. That's one line. Each assumption is one property for one object. Since there are no other conditions, that's the only assumption.\n\nThe problem is to prove |e^{iθ} -1| ≤ |θ|. So the formatted problem should list the assumption as θ is a real number, and the problem statement as proving that inequality.\n\nWait, but the original problem didn't specify any assumptions. However, in mathematics, when dealing with e^{iθ}, θ is generally understood to be real. But according to the user's example, even if the original problem didn't state the assumptions, we need to list them. For instance, in the example, the original problem didn't say n is divisible by 7, but the formatted problem included that. Wait, no, actually in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added the assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Let me check the example again.\n\nWait, the original example problem was: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption says \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that's contradictory. If the original problem states \"for every integer n\", then the assumption that n is an integer is correct. But why does the formatted problem add \"n is divisible by 7\"? That seems like a mistake. Maybe the example was incorrect? Or perhaps the user made an error in the example. Because if the original problem is for every integer n, then the assumption should be n is an integer, but the formatted problem added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7, which is not in the original problem. That seems like an error.\n\nWait, perhaps the example is wrong. Maybe the user intended to show that the original problem had some hidden assumption? But the original problem clearly says \"for every integer n\". So adding \"n is divisible by 7\" would restrict it. So maybe there's a mistake in the example. Alternatively, perhaps the user meant to structure the problem for a specific case where n is divisible by 7. But regardless, following the user's instructions, in the current problem, we need to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into assumptions and problem.\n\nThe current problem is to prove |e^{iθ} -1| ≤ |θ|. The user's book used this lemma in the context of Fourier series, which deals with real θ. So the key assumption is θ is real. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumption is θ is a real number. There are no other conditions given. So that's the only assumption. The problem is to prove that inequality.\n\nSo the final formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nθ is a real number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that |e^{iθ} -1| ≤ |θ|.\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is only one property applied to one object. Since θ is the only object here, and the property is being a real number, that's the only assumption.",
