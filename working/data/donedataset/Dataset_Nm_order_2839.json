    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this integral problem. The user wants to prove that the integral I equals π/(√3) log3 - π²/9. The integral is from 0 to infinity of log[(1+x³)/x³] multiplied by x/(1+x³) dx. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the problem correctly. Let me restate the integral to make sure I have it right. The integrand is log((1+x³)/x³) times x divided by (1+x³). So that's log(1 + 1/x³) multiplied by x/(1+x³). Wait, actually, simplifying the argument of the logarithm: (1+x³)/x³ = 1/x³ + 1. Hmm, but 1/x³ + 1 is the same as (1 + x³)/x³. So the logarithm is log(1 + x³) - log(x³) which is log(1+x³) - 3 log x. That makes sense, as the user already split the integral into two parts: one involving log(1+x³) and the other involving log(x³).\n\nSo the integral I is equal to the integral from 0 to infinity of [log(1+x³) - 3 log x] * x/(1+x³) dx. That splits into two integrals: the first is integral of log(1+x³) * x/(1+x³) dx, and the second is -3 times integral of log x * x/(1+x³) dx, both from 0 to infinity.\n\nThe user mentioned they tried substitution y=1+x³ but it didn't help. Let me check that substitution. If y = 1 + x³, then dy = 3x² dx, but the integrand has x dx, so maybe not straightforward. Alternatively, maybe substitution for the entire expression.\n\nAnother approach is partial integration. The user tried setting u = log(1+x³) and dv = x/(1+x³) dx, but ended up with a divergent integral. Let me see. If u = log(1+x³), then du = (3x²)/(1+x³) dx. dv = x/(1+x³) dx, so v would be the integral of x/(1+x³) dx. Hmm, integrating x/(1+x³) might not be simple. Let me try integrating dv = x/(1+x³) dx. Let's set t = x³, then dt = 3x² dx. Not sure if that helps. Alternatively, partial fractions. The denominator is x³ +1, which factors into (x+1)(x² -x +1). So maybe decompose x/(x³ +1) into partial fractions. That might be a way. Let me try.\n\nBut perhaps another substitution. Let me think. Since the integral is from 0 to infinity, maybe a substitution like t = 1/x. Let me try substituting x = 1/t, so when x approaches 0, t approaches infinity, and when x approaches infinity, t approaches 0. Then dx = -1/t² dt. Let's see how the integrand transforms. \n\nOriginal integrand: log((1+x³)/x³) * x/(1+x³) dx. \n\nSubstituting x = 1/t, we get log((1 + (1/t³))/(1/t³)) * (1/t)/(1 + (1/t³)) * (-1/t²) dt. Simplify the logarithm: (1 + 1/t³)/(1/t³) = t³(1 + 1/t³) = t³ +1. So log(t³ +1). The x/(1+x³) term becomes (1/t)/(1 + 1/t³) = (1/t)/( (t³ +1)/t³ ) = t²/(t³ +1). Then the integrand becomes log(t³ +1) * t²/(t³ +1) * (-1/t²) dt. The t² cancels with 1/t², leaving - log(t³ +1)/(t³ +1) dt. The limits of integration would reverse, so the integral from infinity to 0 becomes integral from 0 to infinity of log(t³ +1)/(t³ +1) dt. But that's the same as the original integral I, but with a negative sign. Wait, but then:\n\nI = ∫₀^∞ log((1+x³)/x³) * x/(1+x³) dx\n\nAfter substitution x=1/t, we have I = ∫₀^∞ [log(t³ +1) - log(t³)] * t/(1 + t³) (-dt/t²)\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me recheck.\n\nOriginal substitution: x = 1/t ⇒ dx = -1/t² dt. Then:\n\nlog((1 + x³)/x³) = log(1 + x³) - log(x³) = log(1 + 1/t³) - log(1/t³) = log( (t³ +1)/t³ ) - (-3 log t) = log(t³ +1) - log t³ + 3 log t = log(t³ +1) - 3 log t + 3 log t = log(t³ +1). Wait, that can't be right. Wait, log((1 + x³)/x³) = log(1 + x³) - log(x³) = log(1 + x³) - 3 log x.\n\nBut substituting x=1/t, log(1 + x³) becomes log(1 + 1/t³) = log( (t³ +1)/t³ ), and 3 log x becomes 3 log(1/t) = -3 log t. So overall, log( (t³ +1)/t³ ) - (-3 log t) = log(t³ +1) - log t³ + 3 log t = log(t³ +1) - 3 log t + 3 log t = log(t³ +1). So the log part simplifies to log(t³ +1). Then the rest of the integrand is x/(1 + x³) dx, which is (1/t)/(1 + 1/t³) * (-1/t²) dt. Let's compute that:\n\nx/(1 + x³) = (1/t)/(1 + 1/t³) = (1/t) / ( (t³ +1)/t³ ) ) = t²/(t³ +1)\n\nMultiply by dx: t²/(t³ +1) * (-1/t²) dt = -1/(t³ +1) dt.\n\nSo the entire integral becomes:\n\n∫_{∞}^0 [log(t³ +1)] * (-1/(t³ +1)) dt = ∫₀^∞ log(t³ +1)/(t³ +1) dt.\n\nBut the original integral I is equal to ∫₀^∞ [log(1 + x³) - 3 log x] * x/(1 +x³) dx. However, after substitution, we have ∫₀^∞ log(t³ +1)/(t³ +1) dt. But this suggests that I is equal to ∫₀^∞ log(t³ +1)/(t³ +1) dt. But that's not the same as the original integral. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.\n\nWait, the substitution led to I = ∫₀^∞ log(t³ +1)/(t³ +1) dt. But how does that relate to the original I?\n\nWait, original I is ∫₀^∞ [log(1 +x³) - 3 log x] * x/(1 +x³) dx. Let's denote the two integrals as I1 and I2:\n\nI1 = ∫₀^∞ log(1 +x³) * x/(1 +x³) dx\n\nI2 = ∫₀^∞ 3 log x * x/(1 +x³) dx\n\nSo I = I1 - I2.\n\nNow, after substitution x=1/t, the integral I1 becomes ∫₀^∞ log(1 +1/t³) * (1/t)/(1 +1/t³) * (-1/t²) dt. Let's compute that:\n\nlog(1 +1/t³) = log( (t³ +1)/t³ ) = log(t³ +1) - 3 log t.\n\nThen (1/t)/(1 +1/t³) = (1/t) / ( (t³ +1)/t³ ) ) = t²/(t³ +1). Multiply by -1/t² dt:\n\n[ log(t³ +1) -3 log t ] * t²/(t³ +1) * (-1/t²) dt = - [ log(t³ +1) -3 log t ] / (t³ +1) dt.\n\nChanging limits, integral becomes ∫₀^∞ [ log(t³ +1) -3 log t ] / (t³ +1) dt. But this is equal to -I1 + 3 ∫₀^∞ log t / (t³ +1) dt. Wait, but this seems complicated. Maybe this substitution isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using symmetry or another substitution. Let me think about the integral ∫₀^∞ x^a / (1 +x³) dx. This might relate to Beta function or Gamma function. But with logarithms involved, differentiation under the integral sign might be useful.\n\nAlternatively, consider writing the integral as ∫₀^∞ [log(1 +x³) - 3 log x] * x/(1 +x³) dx. Let's split into I1 - I2 as before.\n\nFor I1: ∫₀^∞ log(1 +x³) * x/(1 +x³) dx.\n\nFor I2: 3 ∫₀^∞ log x * x/(1 +x³) dx.\n\nPerhaps we can compute these integrals separately.\n\nStarting with I2: 3 ∫₀^∞ log x * x/(1 +x³) dx.\n\nLet me make substitution t = x³, so x = t^(1/3), dx = (1/3) t^(-2/3) dt.\n\nThen when x=0, t=0; x=∞, t=∞.\n\nSo I2 becomes 3 ∫₀^∞ log(t^(1/3)) * t^(1/3) / (1 + t) * (1/3) t^(-2/3) dt.\n\nSimplify:\n\nlog(t^(1/3)) = (1/3) log t.\n\nMultiply by t^(1/3) / (1 + t) * (1/3) t^(-2/3):\n\nSo 3 * [ (1/3) log t ] * t^(1/3) / (1 + t) * (1/3) t^(-2/3) dt.\n\nThe 3 cancels with the first 1/3, leaving (1/3) * log t * t^(1/3 - 2/3) / (1 + t) dt = (1/3) log t * t^(-1/3) / (1 + t) dt.\n\nSo I2 simplifies to (1/3) ∫₀^∞ log t * t^(-1/3) / (1 + t) dt.\n\nThis integral might be evaluated using known results. The integral ∫₀^∞ t^s / (1 + t) dt is Beta function or relates to Gamma functions. Specifically, ∫₀^∞ t^{a-1}/(1 + t)^{a + b} dt = B(a, b), but here the denominator is (1 + t), so perhaps when a + b =1? Wait, maybe recall that ∫₀^∞ t^{c}/(1 + t) dt = π / sin(π(c +1)) when -1 < c < 0. Wait, more generally, ∫₀^∞ t^{k}/(1 + t) dt = π / sin(π(k +1)) for -1 < k <0. But if we differentiate with respect to k, we can get integrals involving log t.\n\nAlternatively, consider that ∫₀^∞ t^{c} log t / (1 + t) dt can be found by differentiating ∫₀^∞ t^{c}/(1 + t) dt with respect to c. Let's denote F(c) = ∫₀^∞ t^{c}/(1 + t) dt = π / sin(π(c +1)) as per the reflection formula. Then F'(c) = ∫₀^∞ t^{c} log t / (1 + t) dt = d/dc [π / sin(π(c +1))]. Compute that derivative.\n\nCompute F'(c) = π * d/dc [1/sin(π(c +1))] = π * (-π cos(π(c +1)) / sin²(π(c +1)) )\n\nBut perhaps using the identity that ∫₀^∞ t^{c}/(1 + t) dt = π / sin(π(c +1)) for c not integer. So then, F'(c) = -π² cos(π(c +1)) / sin²(π(c +1)).\n\nTherefore, the integral I2 is (1/3) * F'(-1/3). Plugging c = -1/3 into F'(c):\n\nF'(-1/3) = -π² cos(π(-1/3 +1)) / sin²(π(-1/3 +1)) = -π² cos(2π/3) / sin²(2π/3).\n\nCompute cos(2π/3) = -1/2, sin(2π/3) = √3/2, so sin²(2π/3) = 3/4.\n\nThus, F'(-1/3) = -π² (-1/2) / (3/4) ) = (π² /2 ) / (3/4) ) = (π² /2 ) * (4/3) ) = (2π²)/3.\n\nThus, I2 = (1/3) * (2π²)/3 = (2π²)/9.\n\nWait, but wait. The substitution led us to I2 being (1/3) F'(-1/3). Let me check:\n\nWe had c = -1/3 in the integral ∫₀^∞ t^{-1/3} log t / (1 + t) dt. So yes, F(c) = ∫ t^{c}/(1 + t) dt, so F'(c) is the integral with log t. So substituting c = -1/3, so F'(-1/3) = derivative at c = -1/3. So F(c) = π / sin(π(c +1)).\n\nThus, F(c) = π / sin(π(c +1)) = π / sin(πc + π). Since sin(πc + π) = -sin(πc). So F(c) = -π / sin(πc). Then F'(c) = d/dc [ -π / sin(πc) ] = π² cos(πc)/sin²(πc).\n\nSo F'(c) = π² cos(πc)/sin²(πc). Therefore, F'(-1/3) = π² cos(-π/3)/sin²(-π/3).\n\nBut cos(-π/3)=cos(π/3)=1/2, and sin(-π/3)= -√3/2, so sin²(-π/3)= (3/4).\n\nThus, F'(-1/3)= π²*(1/2)/(3/4)= π²*(1/2)*(4/3)= (2/3)π².\n\nTherefore, the integral I2 = (1/3)*F'(-1/3)= (1/3)*(2π²/3)= 2π²/9.\n\nOkay, so I2 is 2π²/9. Now moving to I1: ∫₀^∞ log(1 +x³) * x/(1 +x³) dx.\n\nThis seems trickier. Let's consider substitution. Let me set t = x³. Then x = t^{1/3}, dx = (1/3) t^{-2/3} dt. Then when x=0, t=0; x=∞, t=∞.\n\nThen I1 becomes ∫₀^∞ log(1 + t) * t^{1/3}/(1 + t) * (1/3) t^{-2/3} dt.\n\nSimplify: log(1 + t) * t^{1/3 - 2/3}/(1 + t) * (1/3) dt = (1/3) ∫₀^∞ log(1 + t) * t^{-1/3}/(1 + t) dt.\n\nSo I1 = (1/3) ∫₀^∞ log(1 + t) * t^{-1/3}/(1 + t) dt.\n\nHmm, similar to the previous integral but with log(1 + t) instead of log t. Maybe this can be evaluated using differentiation under the integral sign as well. Let me consider the integral G(a) = ∫₀^∞ t^{a}/(1 + t) dt. Then we know G(a) = π / sin(π(a +1)) as before, for -1 < a <0.\n\nBut here we have log(1 + t) * t^{-1/3}/(1 + t). Perhaps express log(1 + t) as derivative with respect to some parameter. Alternatively, consider integrating by parts.\n\nLet me try integrating by parts. Let u = log(1 + t), dv = t^{-1/3}/(1 + t) dt.\n\nThen du = 1/(1 + t) dt, and v = ∫ t^{-1/3}/(1 + t) dt. But integrating dv might not be straightforward. Wait, but perhaps v can be expressed in terms of the Beta function or similar.\n\nAlternatively, consider differentiating G(a) with respect to a parameter. For example, suppose we set H(b) = ∫₀^∞ t^{-1/3}/(1 + t) * (1 + t)^b dt. Wait, but that might not help. Alternatively, think of log(1 + t) as d/db [ (1 + t)^b ] evaluated at b=0. So:\n\nlog(1 + t) = d/db [ (1 + t)^b ] at b=0.\n\nThus, I1 = (1/3) ∫₀^∞ [d/db (1 + t)^b |_{b=0} ] * t^{-1/3}/(1 + t) dt.\n\nThen interchange differentiation and integral:\n\nI1 = (1/3) d/db [ ∫₀^∞ (1 + t)^b * t^{-1/3}/(1 + t) dt ] |_{b=0}.\n\nSimplify integrand: (1 + t)^{b -1} t^{-1/3}.\n\nThus, H(b) = ∫₀^∞ t^{-1/3} (1 + t)^{b -1} dt.\n\nThis is similar to the Beta function integral. Recall that ∫₀^∞ t^{c} (1 + t)^{-d} dt = B(c +1, d -c -1) for certain conditions on c and d.\n\nThe Beta function is defined as B(p, q) = ∫₀^∞ t^{p -1}/(1 + t)^{p + q} dt = Γ(p)Γ(q)/Γ(p + q).\n\nBut in our case, H(b) = ∫₀^∞ t^{-1/3} (1 + t)^{b -1} dt. Let me write this as ∫₀^∞ t^{-1/3} (1 + t)^{-(1 - b)} dt.\n\nComparing with the Beta function form, which is ∫₀^∞ t^{p -1}/(1 + t)^{p + q} dt = B(p, q). So here, p -1 = -1/3 ⇒ p = 2/3, and p + q = 1 - b ⇒ q = 1 - b - p = 1 - b - 2/3 = (1/3 - b).\n\nTherefore, H(b) = B(2/3, 1/3 - b) = Γ(2/3)Γ(1/3 - b)/Γ(1 - b).\n\nTherefore, I1 = (1/3) d/db [ Γ(2/3)Γ(1/3 - b)/Γ(1 - b) ] evaluated at b=0.\n\nDifferentiate H(b) with respect to b:\n\nH’(b) = Γ(2/3) [ Γ’(1/3 - b)(-1) Γ(1 - b) - Γ(1/3 - b) Γ’(1 - b)(-1) ] / [Γ(1 - b)]².\n\nWait, perhaps using logarithmic differentiation. Let me write H(b) = Γ(2/3)Γ(1/3 - b)/Γ(1 - b).\n\nTake natural logarithm: ln H(b) = ln Γ(2/3) + ln Γ(1/3 - b) - ln Γ(1 - b).\n\nDifferentiate both sides with respect to b:\n\nH’(b)/H(b) = [ -ψ(1/3 - b) ] - [ -ψ(1 - b) ] = ψ(1 - b) - ψ(1/3 - b).\n\nTherefore, H’(b) = H(b) [ ψ(1 - b) - ψ(1/3 - b) ].\n\nAt b=0:\n\nH’(0) = H(0) [ ψ(1) - ψ(1/3) ].\n\nBut H(0) = Γ(2/3)Γ(1/3)/Γ(1) = Γ(2/3)Γ(1/3) since Γ(1)=1. We know that Γ(1/3)Γ(2/3) = π / sin(π/3) = π / (√3/2) = 2π/√3.\n\nTherefore, H(0) = 2π/√3.\n\nThus, H’(0) = (2π/√3) [ ψ(1) - ψ(1/3) ].\n\nWe know that ψ(1) = -γ (Euler-Mascheroni constant), and ψ(1/3) = -γ - (3/2)ln3 - (π/(2√3)).\n\nWait, recall that the digamma function at 1/3 is:\n\nψ(1/3) = -γ - (3/2)ln3 - (π/(2√3)).\n\nI need to verify this. The digamma function for fractional arguments can be expressed using certain formulas. For example, from here: ψ(1/3) = -γ - (π/(2√3)) - (3/2)ln3. Yes, that's a standard result.\n\nTherefore, ψ(1) - ψ(1/3) = (-γ) - [ -γ - (3/2)ln3 - (π/(2√3)) ] = (3/2)ln3 + (π/(2√3)).\n\nThus, H’(0) = (2π/√3) [ (3/2)ln3 + (π/(2√3)) ] = (2π/√3)(3/2 ln3) + (2π/√3)(π/(2√3)).\n\nSimplify:\n\nFirst term: (2π/√3)(3/2 ln3) = (3π/√3) ln3 = π√3 ln3.\n\nSecond term: (2π/√3)(π/(2√3)) = (π^2)/(3).\n\nTherefore, H’(0) = π√3 ln3 + π²/3.\n\nBut recall that I1 = (1/3) H’(0) = (1/3)(π√3 ln3 + π²/3) = (π√3 ln3)/3 + π²/9 = (π ln3)/√3 + π²/9.\n\nTherefore, I1 = π/(√3) ln3 + π²/9.\n\nNow, recall that the original integral I = I1 - I2 = [π/(√3) ln3 + π²/9] - [2π²/9] = π/(√3) ln3 + π²/9 - 2π²/9 = π/(√3) ln3 - π²/9.\n\nWhich matches the desired result. Therefore, the integral I is indeed equal to π/(√3) log3 - π²/9.",
