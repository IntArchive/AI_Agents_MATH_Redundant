    "Content": "How would you go about proving that for any system of linear equations (whether all are homogenous or not) can only have either (if this is true): One solution Infinitely many solutions No solutions I found this a bit difficult to prove (even though its a very fundamental thing about any linear equation). The intuitive geometric explanation is that a line can only intersect at one point, and if it intersects at a later point, it can't be a linear equation, but I don't think this is a convincing proof. I thought of if you assume that there are two (or more, but I picked two) solutions for some linear system, then for the points in between Solution Set 1 : X 1 , X 2 ....., X n Solution Set 2 : X 1 , X 2 ....., X n Then (I think), the points between S 1 and S 2 , must be infinitely many points (and thus infinitely many solutions) such that these points can also satisfy the linear system, which would mean the system has 2 infinite solutions. However, I don't think this is rigorous enough and nor do I understand completely why its true. Can anyone help in explaining (correcting) and elaborating on the intuition and proof of this?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Suppose that $\\vec v$ and $\\vec w$ are distinct solutions for the system $A\\vec x = \\vec b$ so that $A \\vec v = A \\vec w = \\vec b$. Then $\\frac{1}{2}(\\vec v + \\vec w)$ must be distinct from both $\\vec v$ and $\\vec w$ and must also solve the system since:\n$$\nA(\\tfrac{1}{2}(\\vec v + \\vec w)) = \\tfrac{1}{2}(A\\vec v + A\\vec w) = \\tfrac{1}{2}(\\vec b + \\vec b) = \\vec b\n$$\nWe can then apply the same argument to $\\vec v$ and $\\frac{1}{2}(\\vec v + \\vec w)$ in order to get infinitely many distinct solutions.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants to prove that any linear system cannot have exactly 2 solutions. They mentioned the intuitive geometric idea that two lines can intersect at most once, but they want a more rigorous proof. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what a linear system is. A system of linear equations can be represented as Ax = b, where A is a matrix, x is the vector of variables, and b is the constant term. The solutions to this system depend on the rank of the matrix A and the augmented matrix [A|b]. \n\nThe user is right that geometrically, in two dimensions, two lines either intersect at one point (unique solution), are parallel (no solution), or coincide (infinitely many solutions). But this is just in two dimensions. The problem is about any linear system, which could be in more variables and equations.\n\nThe key idea here is that the solution set of a linear system is an affine subspace. Affine subspaces have the property that if you have two distinct solutions, then any point on the line connecting these two solutions is also a solution. This would mean that if there are two solutions, there must be infinitely many. \n\nLet me try to formalize this. Suppose there are two distinct solutions x and y. Then for any scalar t, the vector z = x + t(y - x) should also be a solution. Let's check this. If Ax = b and Ay = b, then Az = A(x + t(y - x)) = Ax + tA(y - x) = b + t(b - b) = b. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, if Ay = b, then A(y - x) = Ay - Ax = b - b = 0. So actually, Az = Ax + t*(0) = b + 0 = b. Therefore, z is indeed a solution for any t. \n\nBut wait, this seems to imply that if there are two distinct solutions, then there are infinitely many solutions along the line connecting them. Therefore, you can't have exactly two solutions. That makes sense. So the affine combination of any two solutions is also a solution, leading to infinitely many solutions if there are at least two.\n\nBut the user mentioned \"any system of linear equations (whether all are homogenous or not)\". So this applies to both homogeneous (Ax=0) and non-homogeneous (Ax=b) systems. For homogeneous systems, the solution set is a subspace, which is closed under linear combinations, so if there are two distinct solutions, their entire line is in the solution set. For non-homogeneous systems, the solution set is an affine subspace, so same logic applies: two solutions imply infinitely many.\n\nTherefore, the proof structure would be: assume there are two distinct solutions, then show that any point on the line connecting them is also a solution, which requires the linearity of the system. Since the line has infinitely many points, there are infinitely many solutions.\n\nThe user's initial thought was correct but perhaps not phrased rigorously. They mentioned \"points between S1 and S2 must be infinitely many solutions\", which aligns with the affine combination idea. The key step is to show that linear combinations of solutions (in the affine sense for non-homogeneous) are also solutions.\n\nSo, to structure the problem according to the given format, the assumption is that the system is linear. The problem is to prove that such a system cannot have exactly two solutions; it must have none, one, or infinitely many.",
