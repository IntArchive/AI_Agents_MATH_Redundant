    "AcceptedAnswer": "It is actually not very difficult to obtain the correct antiderivative (for some reason i use $a$ for the integral parameter, not $m$ ).\nThe only non-trivial observation here is how to write the more compelx part of the integral as a derivative ( $'$ denotes differentation w.r.t. $x$ ): $$I = (2a)^{-1}\\int \\left(\\frac{\\cos(x)+a \\sin(x)}{\\cos(x)-a \\sin(x)}\\right)' \\sin^2(x)e^{-2 a x}$$ integrating by parts, we can just cancel the annoying stuff: $$\n(2a)I = e^{-2 a x}\\sin^2(x)\\frac{\\cos(x)+a \\sin(x)}{\\cos(x)-a \\sin(x)} -\\\\\n\\int \\left(\\frac{\\cos(x)+a \\sin(x)}{\\color{red}{\\cos(x)-a \\sin(x)}}\\right)( \\color{red}{\\cos(x)-a \\sin(x)}) \\sin(x)e^{-2 a x} \n$$ the remaining integral is elementary: $$\ne^{2 a x}(2a)I =\\sin^2(x)\\frac{\\cos(x)+a \\sin(x)}{\\cos(x)-a \\sin(x)}+\\frac{(\\cos(x)+a \\sin(x))^2}{a^2+1}\n$$ this can be brought into the form indicated by @Claude Leibovici, but i don't have the right temper for stupid algebra like that at the moment",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this integral problem. The user provided a question from Edwards' Integral Calculus, and they want me to structure it according to the given format. First, I need to extract the problem and list the assumptions properly.\n\nThe original problem is to show that the integral from 0 to π/4 of [sin²x / (e^{2mx}(cosx - m sinx)^2)] dx equals a specific expression involving m. The user mentions that it's from a section where substitution tricks like replacing x with π/4 - x and series expansions are introduced. They also tried expanding tan²x/(1 - m tanx)^2 as a series in m tanx but didn't succeed.\n\nNow, following the example provided, I need to list all assumptions. Each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. Let me parse the problem:\n\n1. The integral is definite, from 0 to π/4.\n2. The integrand is sin²x divided by [e^{2mx} multiplied by (cosx - m sinx)^2].\n3. The result is a function of m, given as [1/(2m(1 + m²))][(1 + m)/(1 - m) e^{-mπ/2} - 1].\n4. The problem is about proving this equality.\n5. The variables involved are x (integration variable) and m (parameter). The problem doesn't specify constraints on m, but likely m ≠ 1 to avoid division by zero in the result, and m ≠ 0 because of the 2m in the denominator. Also, since there's an exponential term e^{-mπ/2}, m must be such that the integral converges. So possible assumptions on m could be real numbers where the integral is defined.\n\nWait, but in the example given earlier, the assumption included that n is divisible by 7. But here, the problem might not state explicit assumptions on m, unless implied. The original problem statement from the user doesn't specify any restrictions on m, but the answer's structure requires listing assumptions. So perhaps the integral's validity requires certain conditions on m. For example, the denominator (cosx - m sinx) should not be zero in the interval [0, π/4], so cosx - m sinx ≠ 0 for x in [0, π/4]. That would mean m ≠ cotx for x in [0, π/4]. The maximum value of cotx in that interval is cot(0) which is infinity, and at π/4 it's 1. So m must be less than 1? Wait, because cotx decreases from infinity to 1 as x goes from 0 to π/4. So if m is ≥1, then at x where cotx = m, which would be x = arccot(m). But if m ≥1, then arccot(m) ≤ π/4. So for m ≥1, the denominator would be zero at x = arccot(m), making the integral improper. Therefore, perhaps the assumption is that m is such that cosx - m sinx ≠ 0 in [0, π/4], i.e., m < 1. Alternatively, m could be a parameter for which the integral converges despite possible singularities, but the given answer expression includes (1 - m) in the denominator, implying m ≠1. Also, m ≠0 because of the 2m in the denominator. So possible assumptions are m is a real number, m ≠0, m ≠1. However, the problem might not state these explicitly, but for the integral to be defined, these conditions are necessary. But since the original problem didn't mention them, maybe I should include them as implicit assumptions.\n\nAnother assumption is that the integral is evaluated using substitution or series expansion as per the book's context. So the problem expects the use of substitution like replacing x with π/4 - x, or expanding in series. But the user tried series without success.\n\nNow, structuring the problem according to the format:\n\nAssumptions should list each condition. Let's see:\n\nAssumption:\n- The integral is evaluated from 0 to π/4.\n- m is a real number.\n- m ≠0.\n- m ≠1.\n- The denominator (cosx - m sinx) is non-zero for all x in [0, π/4].\n\nBut maybe the problem as stated doesn't specify these, so perhaps only the first assumption is explicit (integral bounds), and others are implicit. However, to make the problem well-posed, the assumptions on m are necessary. The example given had the original problem mentioning \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem included \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, an additional assumption \"n is divisible by 7\" was added. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, the original example's problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps that was a mistake. Let me check.\n\nOriginal example: Original problem says \"for every integer n\", but formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That would change the problem. That example might have been incorrect, but according to the user's instruction, perhaps the task is to filter unrelated information and list all necessary assumptions. But maybe in that example, the user made a mistake. Wait, no. Wait, the original problem might have had a misstatement. Alternatively, perhaps the example was constructed to show how to format, even if it changes the problem. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, the user's example shows that the original problem is to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem lists assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That would actually narrow down the problem. But that seems incorrect. Unless there was a miscommunication. Maybe the user intended to show that the problem's assumptions include that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the problem's actual conditions but not explicitly stated. But according to the original problem statement provided in the example, it was \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That's inconsistent. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. However, given that, perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions should be based on what's necessary for the integral to make sense, even if not explicitly stated in the original problem.\n\nBut the original problem here is presented as \"Show that [integral] equals [expression]\". So the assumptions would include the bounds, the integrand's form, and any necessary conditions on m for convergence and to avoid division by zero. The problem doesn't specify any restrictions on m, but mathematically, m must not cause the denominator to be zero in the interval [0, π/4]. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\n- The integral is evaluated from 0 to π/4.\n- m is a real number such that cosx - m sinx ≠ 0 for all x in [0, π/4].\n- m ≠ 1 to avoid division by zero in the result expression.\n- m ≠ 0 because the result expression has 2m in the denominator.\n\nBut perhaps the problem assumes m is such that the integral converges, so these are implicit. However, to structure the problem correctly, each assumption should be listed. Alternatively, if the original problem didn't mention any constraints, maybe the only explicit assumption is the integral bounds, but I need to check the user's example again.\n\nWait, in the user's example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", which was not in the original. So maybe the user wants to extract all conditions from the problem, even implicit ones. However, that might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps in the example, the original problem had a typo, and the user corrected it. But given the instructions, I should follow the example's approach, even if it modifies the original problem. But in the current problem, the integral's result has terms that require m ≠1, m ≠0, so those are necessary for the expression to be defined, hence they are assumptions. Additionally, the denominator in the integrand must not be zero in the interval, which requires m <1 (as discussed earlier). Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The integral is evaluated from 0 to π/4.\n- m is a real number.\n- m ≠0.\n- m ≠1.\n- For all x in [0, π/4], cosx - m sinx ≠0.\n\nBut maybe combining some conditions. However, the example splits each assumption into separate lines. So each bullet is one condition. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is from 0 to π/4.\nm is a real number.\nm ≠0.\nm ≠1.\ncosx - m sinx ≠0 for all x in [0, π/4].\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the last two can be combined into m <1, but if the problem allows complex m, but likely m is real. The problem is from a calculus book, so m is probably real. So to list each condition:\n\nAssumption:\nm is a real number.\nm ≠0.\nm ≠1.\nFor all x in [0, π/4], cosx - m sinx ≠0.\n\nBut how to phrase \"For all x in [0, π/4], cosx - m sinx ≠0\"? Maybe rephrase as \"The denominator (cosx - m sinx) is non-zero on the interval [0, π/4]\".\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is given as is, maybe the only explicit assumption is the integral bounds. But the user's example added assumptions not present in the original problem. Wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That suggests that the user's example might have modified the problem, which is confusing. Perhaps there was a mistake in the example. Given that, maybe I should stick to what's explicitly given in the problem, and not add implicit assumptions unless necessary.\n\nThe original problem here is: \"Show that [integral expression] equals [result]\". The only explicit information is the integral bounds and the integrand. The assumptions would then be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated from 0 to π/4.\nThe integrand is sin²x divided by [e^{2mx}(cosx - m sinx)^2].\n\nBut the example included assumptions on variables, like n being an integer. Here, m is a parameter; maybe the problem assumes m is a real number not equal to 0 or 1, but since it's not stated, maybe we shouldn't include unless necessary. However, to ensure the problem is well-posed, we need those assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem as stated in the book includes certain conditions on m, but the user didn't transcribe them. The user's question says \"This problem is from Edwards, Treatise on Integral Calculus II, pg.187.\" So maybe in the book, there were conditions on m, but the user didn't mention them. Since I don't have access to the book, I can only go by what's provided.\n\nThe user's original problem statement says: \"Show that [integral] = [expression]\". The expression has (1 - m) in the denominator, implying m ≠1. Also, 2m in the denominator implies m ≠0. Therefore, these are necessary for the expression to be defined. Hence, the assumptions must include m ≠0, m ≠1. Additionally, the integrand's denominator (cosx - m sinx)^2 must not be zero in [0, π/4], which requires m < cotx for all x in [0, π/4]. Since cotx decreases from infinity to 1 over [0, π/4], to avoid cosx - m sinx =0, m must be <1. Because if m ≥1, then there's some x in [0, π/4] where cotx = m, leading to denominator zero. Therefore, m <1. But also, if m is negative, then cosx - m sinx would be positive (since m sinx would be negative, so -m sinx positive), so denominator would be positive. So m can be negative. So the condition is m <1. Therefore, m <1.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated from 0 to π/4.\nm is a real number.\nm ≠0.\nm ≠1.\nm <1.\n\nBut m <1 ensures that cosx - m sinx >0 for all x in [0, π/4]. Alternatively, phrasing it as:\n\ncosx - m sinx ≠0 for all x in [0, π/4].\n\nBut since m is real, and for x in [0, π/4], cotx ≥1, so to avoid cotx =m, m must be <1. Hence, m <1. So combining:\n\nAssumption:\nm is a real number with m <1.\nm ≠0.\n\nBecause m=0 would make the denominator (cosx)^2, which is fine except in the result expression, which has 2m in the denominator. So m ≠0 is needed for the expression to be defined. Also, m ≠1 is covered by m <1. Therefore, the assumptions can be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated from 0 to π/4.\nm is a real number.\nm <1.\nm ≠0.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So separate:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is from 0 to π/4.\nm is a real number.\nm is less than 1.\nm is not equal to 0.\n\nEach of these is a separate line. Now, the problem is to show the integral equals the given expression. Thus, the formatted problem would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nThe integral is evaluated from 0 to π/4,\nm is a real number,\nm is less than 1,\nm is not equal to 0.\nProblem:\nShow that $$\\int_0^{\\frac{\\pi}{4}} \\frac{\\sin^2 x}{e^{2mx}(\\cos x-m\\sin x)^2}dx=\\frac{1}{2m(1+m^2)}\\left[\\frac{1+m}{1-m}e^{-m\\frac{\\pi}{2}}-1\\right]$$\n###",
