    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original problem is about proving that a certain expression involving nested radicals is a natural number. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the problem and extract the assumptions. The assumptions should list each condition or property applied to one object. The problem statement mentions an expression with fifth roots and cube roots. The key here is to identify any hidden conditions or constraints. \n\nLooking at the problem: the expression is given as the fifth root of 1782 plus some terms involving cube roots. The user defines x as the sum of two cube roots, then manipulates it to get a polynomial equation. However, the original problem doesn't explicitly state any assumptions beyond the definitions of the terms involved. But in such radical expressions, sometimes there are implicit assumptions, like the expressions under the roots being real numbers, which would require the arguments of the roots to be non-negative. Let me check:\n\nThe cube roots are of 35 ±15√6. Let's compute 15√6 ≈ 15*2.449 ≈ 36.735. So 35 + 36.735 ≈ 71.735 and 35 - 36.735 ≈ -1.735. Wait, the second term under the cube root is negative. However, cube roots of negative numbers are real, so that's okay. So maybe the assumption is that the expressions under the cube roots are real, which they are. Similarly, the fifth root of 1782+... will need the argument to be a real number, but since 1782 is positive and the other terms might add up to a positive number, that should be fine. But the problem states that the entire expression is a natural number, so we can assume that the value inside the fifth root is a perfect fifth power, and the subtracted terms result in a natural number. \n\nBut in the example given by the user, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem doesn't state any such divisibility, but perhaps the key assumption is that the expressions under the radicals are real numbers, which they are. However, the user's example extracted the divisibility condition from the original problem. In this case, the problem as stated doesn't have explicit assumptions beyond the expressions being real and the result being a natural number. Wait, but the problem is to prove that the expression is in N, which is the set of natural numbers. So maybe there are no explicit assumptions given, but the problem itself is to show that the expression is a natural number. Therefore, the assumptions would be the definitions of the terms involved, but since the user's example didn't list definitions but rather conditions, maybe here the assumptions are the properties required for the expression to make sense.\n\nWait, let's look again at the original problem's formatted example. The original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. However, in the original problem statement, the user wrote \"for every integer n\", but then the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, no. The original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem included an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe there was a mistake there. But perhaps in the example, the user added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nOriginal problem example: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". But that contradicts the original problem's statement. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the example? Or maybe the example is incorrect. But regardless, the user provided that example. So perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions need to be extracted from the problem's context. \n\nIn the current problem, the expression involves cube roots and a fifth root. The key assumptions would be that each radical is a real number, which is true here. For example, the cube roots of 35 ±15√6: as discussed, 35 -15√6 is negative, but cube roots of negatives are allowed. The fifth root is of 1782 + ... which is positive. So maybe the assumptions are that each radical expression is real, but since the problem states the entire expression is a natural number, perhaps there's an assumption that the expression under the fifth root is a perfect fifth power. However, that's part of what needs to be proven, not an assumption. So perhaps there are no explicit assumptions beyond the definitions. But according to the example, sometimes assumptions are part of the problem's original conditions. But in the example, the original problem didn't state n is divisible by 7, but the formatted problem included it as an assumption. Wait, that seems incorrect. Maybe the example was wrong. Wait, let me check again:\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut that's conflicting because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted version adds that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. So perhaps the example is incorrect. Therefore, maybe the user expects that in the current problem, the assumptions are only the necessary conditions for the problem to make sense. In this case, the problem is to show that the given expression is a natural number, so the assumptions would be that the expressions under each radical are real numbers, which they are, but since that's automatically satisfied, maybe there are no explicit assumptions. However, the problem might have implicit assumptions, like the variables involved being real. But in the example, the user included assumptions from the problem statement. Wait, maybe the example is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants to extract any given conditions. In the current problem, the user defines x as the sum of two cube roots, but that's part of their attempt, not the original problem. The original problem only states the expression to prove. Therefore, perhaps there are no explicit assumptions beyond the expressions being real. However, the problem statement itself doesn't mention any variables or parameters, so maybe the only assumption is that the expression is defined (i.e., the argument of the fifth root is a non-negative real number, which it is, given that 1782 is positive and the other terms are real numbers adding up to something). Therefore, the problem can be structured with no assumptions beyond the definitions inherent in the expression. However, the example had assumptions, so maybe the user expects that here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem's original assumptions are that the cube roots are real, which they are. So maybe:\n\nAssumption: \nThe expression under the fifth root is a real number,\nEach cube root term is a real number,\nThe expression evaluates to a natural number.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that it's a natural number, so that last one is the conclusion, not an assumption. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\n1782 + 405√[3]{35+15√6} + 405√[3]{35-15√6} is a non-negative real number,\n√[3]{35+15√6} and √[3]{35-15√6} are real numbers.\n\nBut these are automatically true, as the fifth root of a real number (since the argument is real and positive), and cube roots of real numbers. Therefore, maybe there are no necessary assumptions to list except the inherent ones. However, according to the user's example, even if the original problem didn't state assumptions, the formatted version added them. But in the example, it seems incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps in the current problem, since the user's try introduces x as the sum of the two cube roots, and then derives a polynomial equation, perhaps the assumption is that x satisfies that equation. But that's part of the solution attempt, not the original problem's assumptions. Therefore, perhaps the original problem has no explicit assumptions beyond the expression being well-defined, which it is. Therefore, maybe the assumptions section is empty, but the user's example shows that sometimes assumptions are extracted from the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem's assumption is that the expression is a natural number, but that's what needs to be proven. \n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me check the user's example again. The original problem was to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem listed assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption that n is an integer is correct, but the additional assumption that n is divisible by 7 is not part of the original problem. Therefore, the example might be incorrect. Perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. Therefore, in the current problem, perhaps the assumptions should only include what's necessary for the problem to make sense. Since the problem is to prove that the given expression is a natural number, and the expression involves radicals, the assumptions would be that all radicals are real numbers, which they are. Therefore, the assumptions could be:\n\nAssumption:\n35 + 15√6 is a real number,\n35 - 15√6 is a real number,\n1782 + 405√[3]{35+15√6} + 405√[3]{35-15√6} is a non-negative real number.\n\nBut these are all obviously true since √6 is real, so 35 ±15√6 are real, their cube roots are real, and 1782 plus those terms is positive. Therefore, maybe the problem doesn't have explicit assumptions beyond the expression being well-defined. However, the user's example included assumptions even if they were part of the problem statement. Therefore, perhaps in this case, the problem has no explicit assumptions beyond the expression's components being real. But since the problem is to prove the expression is a natural number, maybe there are no assumptions to list. Alternatively, the problem might assume that the expression under the fifth root is a perfect fifth power, but that's what needs to be proven. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the problem's title: \"How prove this √[5]{1782+...} is positive integer numbers.\" So the problem is to show that the entire expression is a positive integer. Therefore, the assumptions would be the components are real numbers, but since that's inherent, perhaps there are no assumptions to list. In the example, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So following that pattern, here, perhaps the assumption is that the cube roots and fifth root are real numbers. But the user's example added an assumption not present in the original problem (n divisible by 7), which was incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the user's example was flawed, and the correct approach is to list only the assumptions explicitly given in the problem. However, in the current problem, there are no explicit assumptions given beyond the expression itself. Therefore, maybe the assumptions section is empty. But the example shows that even if the problem states \"for every integer n\", the assumption is listed as \"n is an integer\". Therefore, in this problem, perhaps the assumption is that the expression is well-defined (i.e., the radicals are real numbers), but since that's automatically true, maybe it's redundant. Alternatively, the problem might have no assumptions. \n\nGiven the confusion from the example, but trying to follow the user's instruction to structure like the example, perhaps the assumption here is that the cube roots and fifth root are real numbers. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\n35 + 15√6 is a real number,\n35 - 15√6 is a real number,\n1782 + 405√[3]{35+15√6} + 405√[3]{35-15√6} is a non-negative real number.\n\nProblem: Prove that\n$$\\sqrt[5]{1782+405\\sqrt[3]{35+15\\sqrt{6}}+405\\sqrt[3]{35-15\\sqrt{6}}}-\\sqrt[3]{35+15\\sqrt{6}}-\\sqrt[3]{35-15\\sqrt{6}}\\in \\mathbb{N}$$\n\nWait, but looking at the original problem, there's a typo in the LaTeX: the fifth root expression has \"...\" which in the original problem is filled as 405√[3]{35+15√6} +405√[3]{35-15√6}. So the full expression inside the fifth root is 1782 + 405 times each cube root term. So the correct LaTeX should be:\n\n$$\\sqrt[5]{1782+405\\sqrt[3]{35+15\\sqrt{6}}+405\\sqrt[3]{35-15\\sqrt{6}}}-\\sqrt[3]{35+15\\sqrt{6}}-\\sqrt[3]{35-15\\sqrt{6}}\\in \\mathbb{N}$$\n\nSo the assumptions are that each radical is a real number, which they are. Therefore, the formatted problem would list these as assumptions, even though they're inherent. But in the user's example, assumptions were conditions on the variable (n is integer, n divisible by 7), but in this problem, there are no variables—just a specific expression. Therefore, maybe there are no assumptions beyond the expression being well-defined. However, the user's example included assumptions from the problem statement. In this case, since the problem is to prove the expression is a natural number, perhaps the only assumption is that the expression is well-defined, which it is. But since the example included redundant assumptions, perhaps here we should list the components as real numbers. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has no assumptions, and the formatted version would have an empty assumption section. But the example didn't do that. Therefore, to adhere to the example's structure, even if the original problem doesn't state assumptions, we need to extract any implicit ones. \n\nGiven that, the assumptions would be:\n\n- Each cube root term is a real number.\n- The expression under the fifth root is a non-negative real number.\n\nBut since these are automatically satisfied, they are implicit. However, per the user's example, which listed \"n is an integer\" even though the problem stated \"for every integer n\", perhaps here we should list:\n\nAssumption:\n35 + 15√6 is a real number,\n35 - 15√6 is a real number,\n1782 + 405√[3]{35+15√6} + 405√[3]{35-15√6} is a non-negative real number.\n\nProblem: Prove that the given expression is a natural number.\n\nBut maybe the user expects a different approach. Let me check the original problem's title: it mentions the expression is a positive integer. The problem statement is to prove it's in N. So perhaps the assumptions are just the existence of the radicals as real numbers. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n√[3]{35+15√6} is a real number,\n√[3]{35-15√6} is a real number,\nThe expression inside the fifth root is a non-negative real number.\n\nProblem: Prove that the given expression is a natural number.\n\nBut the problem statement already includes these terms, so maybe the assumptions are redundant. However, following the user's example, which listed \"n is an integer\" even though the problem stated \"for every integer n\", perhaps we need to list each component's condition. \n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n35 + 15√6 is a real number,\n35 - 15√6 is a real number,\n1782 + 405√[3]{35+15√6} + 405√[3]{35-15√6} is a non-negative real number,\n√[3]{35+15√6} and √[3]{35-15√6} are real numbers.\nProblem:\nProve that\n$$\\sqrt[5]{1782+405\\sqrt[3]{35+15\\sqrt{6}}+405\\sqrt[3]{35-15\\sqrt{6}}}-\\sqrt[3]{35+15\\sqrt{6}}-\\sqrt[3]{35-15\\sqrt{6}} \\in \\mathbb{N}$$\n###\n\nBut this seems redundant. Alternatively, maybe just list each cube root and the fifth root's argument as real numbers:\n\nAssumption:\n√[3]{35+15√6} is a real number,\n√[3]{35-15√6} is a real number,\n1782 + 405√[3]{35+15√6} + 405√[3]{35-15√6} ≥ 0.\n\nProblem: ...\n\nAlternatively, since cube roots of real numbers are always real, maybe the first two assumptions are redundant. The third one, that the argument of the fifth root is non-negative, is necessary for the fifth root to be real. But since 1782 is positive and the other terms are real, their sum is real, but is it non-negative? Let's compute approximately:\n\nCompute 35 + 15√6 ≈35 +15*2.449≈35+36.735≈71.735. Its cube root is approximately cube root of ~71.735 ≈ 4.15. Similarly, 35 -15√6≈35-36.735≈-1.735. Cube root of that is approximately -1.23. Therefore, each cube root term is approximately 4.15 and -1.23. Then 405 times each: 405*4.15≈1680.75 and 405*(-1.23)≈-498.15. Then adding 1782 + 1680.75 -498.15 ≈1782 + 1182.6≈2964.6, which is positive. Therefore, the fifth root's argument is positive. Thus, the fifth root is real. Therefore, the assumption that the fifth root's argument is non-negative is valid. But since this can be numerically verified, perhaps it's part of the problem's given conditions. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nThe expression inside the fifth root is non-negative.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't state this, it's derived from the structure. However, per the user's example, they might want each assumption line by line. Therefore, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n35 + 15√6 is a real number,\n35 - 15√6 is a real number,\n1782 is a non-negative real number,\n405√[3]{35+15√6} is a real number,\n405√[3]{35-15√6} is a real number,\nThe sum 1782 + 405√[3]{35+15√6} + 405√[3]{35-15√6} is non-negative.\n\nBut this is overly detailed. Maybe better to combine related ones. However, the user's example listed each assumption line by line for each object. For example, \"n is an integer\", \"n is divisible by 7\". So perhaps here:\n\nAssumption:\n35 + 15√6 is a real number,\n35 - 15√6 is a real number,\n√[3]{35+15√6} is a real number,\n√[3]{35-15√6} is a real number,\n1782 + 405√[3]{35+15√6} + 405√[3]{35-15√6} is a non-negative real number.\n\nProblem: Prove that the expression is a natural number.\n\nBut again, many of these are automatically true. However, following the user's example, even if redundant, list each assumption. Therefore, the final answer would be as above.",
