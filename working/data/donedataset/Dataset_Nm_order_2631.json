    "Content": "While solving a quantum mechanics problem using perturbation theory I encountered the following sum\n$$\nS_{0,1}=\\sum_{m=1}^\\infty\\frac{y_{1,m}y_{0,1}}{[y_{1,m}-y_{0,1}]^3},\n$$\nwhere $y_{n,k}=\\left(\\text{BesselJZero[n,k]}\\right)^2$ is square of the $k$-th zero of Bessel function $J_n$ of the first kind. Numerical calculation using Mathematica showed that $S_{0,1}\\approx 0.1250000$. Although I couldn't verify this with higher precision I found some other cases where analogous sums are close to rational numbers. Specifically, after some experimentation I found that the sums\n$$\nS_{n,k}=\\sum_{m=1}^\\infty\\frac{y_{n+1,m}y_{n,k}}{[y_{n+1,m}-y_{n,k}]^3}\n$$\nare independent of $k$ and have rational values for integer $n$, and made the following conjecture $\\bf{Conjecture:}\\ $ for $k=1,2,3,...$ and  arbitrary $n\\geq 0$\n  $$\\sum_{m=1}^\\infty\\frac{y_{n+1,m}y_{n,k}}{[y_{n+1,m}-y_{n,k}]^3}\\overset{?}=\\frac{n+1}{8},\\\\ \\text{where}\\  y_{n,k}=\\left(\\text{BesselJZero[n,k]}\\right)^2. \n$$ How one can prove it? It seems this conjecture is correct also for negative values of $n$. For example for $n=-\\frac{1}{2}$ one has $y_{\\frac{1}{2},m}=\\pi^2 m^2$, $y_{-\\frac{1}{2},k}=\\pi^2 \\left(k-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2$ and the conjecture becomes (see Claude Leibovici's answer for more details)\n$$\n\\sum_{m=1}^\\infty\\frac{m^2\\left(k-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2}{\\left(m^2-\\left(k-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2\\right)^3}=\\frac{\\pi^2}{16}.\n$$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "There is a rather neat proof of this. First, note that there is already an analogue for this: DLMF §10.21 says that a Rayleigh\nfunction $\\sigma_n(\\nu)$ is defined as a similar power series\n$$ \\sigma_n(\\nu) = \\sum_{m\\geq1} y_{\\nu, m}^{-n}. $$\nIt links to http://arxiv.org/abs/math/9910128v1 among others as an example of how\nto evaluate such things. In your case, call $\\zeta_m = y_{\\nu,m}$ and $z=y_{\\nu-1,k}$ ($\\nu$ is $n$ shifted by $1$), so that after\nexpanding in partial fractions your sum is\n$$ \\sum_{m\\geq1} \\frac{\\zeta_m z}{(\\zeta_m-z)^3} = \\sum_{m\\geq1}\n\\frac{z^2}{(\\zeta_m-z)^3} + \\frac{z}{(\\zeta_m-z)^2}. $$ Introduce the function\n$$ y_\\nu(z) = z^{-\\nu/2}J_\\nu(z^{1/2}). $$\nBy DLMF 10.6.5 its derivative\nsatisfies the two relations\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n y'_\\nu(z) &= (2z)^{-1} y_{\\nu-1}(z) - \\nu z^{-1} y_\\nu(z) \n\\\\&=\n-\\tfrac12 y_{\\nu+1}(z).\n\\end{aligned} $$ It also has the infinite product\nexpansion $$ y_\\nu(z) = \\frac{1}{2^\\nu\\nu!}\\prod_{k\\geq1}(1 - z/\\zeta_k). $$\nTherefore, each partial sum of $(\\zeta_k-z)^{-s}$, $s\\geq1$ can be evaluated in\nterms of derivatives of $y_\\nu$:\n$$ \\sum_{k\\geq1}(\\zeta_k-z)^{-s} = \\frac{-1}{(s-1)!}\\frac{d^s}{dz^s}\\log\ny_\\nu(z). $$\nWhen evaluating this logarithmic derivative, the derivative $y'_\\nu$\ncan be expressed in terms of $y_{\\nu-1}$, going down in $\\nu$, but the derivative\n$y'_{\\nu-1}$ can be expressed in terms of $y_\\nu$ using the other\nrelation that goes up in the index $\\nu$. So even higher-order derivatives contain only $y_\\nu$ and $y_{\\nu-1}$. I calculated your sum using this procedure with a CAS as:\n$$ -\\tfrac12z^2(\\log y)''' -z(\\log y)''\n= \\tfrac18\\nu + z^{-1} P\\big(y_{\\nu-1}(z)/y_\\nu(z)\\big), $$\nwhere $P$ is the polynomial\n$$ P(q) = -\\tfrac18 q^3 + (\\tfrac38\\nu-\\tfrac18) q^2 + (-\\tfrac14\\nu^2\n+ \\tfrac14\\nu - \\tfrac18)q. $$ When $z$ is chosen to be any root of $y_{\\nu-1}$,\n$z=\\mathsf{BesselJZero}[\\nu-1, k]\\hat{}2$, $P(q)=0$, your sum is equal\nto\n$$ \\frac{\\nu}{8}, $$\nwhich is $(n+1)/8$ in your notation. It is possible to derive a number of such closed forms for sums of\nthis type. For example, by differentiating $\\log y$ differently\n(going $\\nu\\to\\nu+1\\to\\nu$), one would get\n$$ \\sum_{m\\geq1}\n\\frac{y_{\\nu,m}y_{\\nu+1,k}}{(y_{\\nu,m}-y_{\\nu+1,k})^3} =\n-\\frac{\\nu}{8}. $$ Some other examples, for which the r.h.s. is independent of $z$ ($\\zeta_m=y_{\\nu,m}, z=y_{\\nu-1,l}$, $l$ arbitrary):\n$$ \\begin{gathered}\n\\sum_{k\\geq1} \\frac{\\zeta_k}{(\\zeta_k-z)^2} = \\frac14,\\\\\n\\sum_{k\\geq1} \\frac{z^2}{(\\zeta_k-z)^4} - \\frac{1}{(\\zeta_k-z)^2} + \\frac1{24}\\frac{5-\\nu}{\\zeta_k-z} = \\frac{1}{48}, \\\\\n\\sum_{k\\geq1} \\frac{\\zeta_k}{(\\zeta_k-z)^4} + \\frac1{96}\\frac{z-\\zeta_k-8+4\\nu}{(\\zeta_k-z)^2} = 0. \n\\end{gathered} $$\nor with $z=y_{\\nu+1,l}$, $l$ arbitrary:\n$$ \\begin{gathered}\n\\sum_{k\\geq1} \\frac{z^2}{(\\zeta_k-z)^3} = -\\tfrac18\\nu-\\tfrac14,\n\\end{gathered} $$\nand they get messier with higher degrees.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to format this problem according to the user's instructions. The original question is about a conjecture involving Bessel function zeros. First, I need to extract the key assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe problem mentions a sum S_{n,k} defined as the sum from m=1 to infinity of [y_{n+1,m} * y_{n,k} divided by [y_{n+1,m} - y_{n,k}]^3. Here, y_{n,k} is the square of the k-th zero of the Bessel function J_n. The conjecture is that this sum equals (n+1)/8, independent of k, for integer n and arbitrary k.\n\nAssumptions to list: Each assumption should be a single property applied to one object. Let's break it down.\n\n1. n is an integer. (From \"for integer n\")\n2. k is a positive integer (since k=1,2,3,...)\n3. n is greater than or equal to 0 (from \"arbitrary n ≥ 0\")\n4. y_{n,k} is the square of the k-th zero of the Bessel function J_n. (Definition provided)\n5. The sum S_{n,k} is independent of k. (Stated in the problem)\n6. The conjecture applies to negative n as well, but the main case is n ≥ 0. However, the user example didn't include the negative part in assumptions, so maybe focus on the primary conditions. Since the problem mentions \"arbitrary n ≥ 0\", but the conjecture is made for n ≥ 0, maybe the assumption is n is a non-negative integer. But the example given in the problem includes the user mentioning negative n, but the conjecture is stated for n ≥ 0. Wait, the original conjecture is for arbitrary n ≥ 0, but then the user says it seems correct for negative n too. But the main conjecture is for n ≥ 0. So perhaps the assumption is n is a non-negative integer. However, in the example, the user included \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem didn't state it but perhaps the assumption was inferred. Wait, the example given by the user was:\n\nOriginal problem had to prove A(n) divisible by 91, and the formatted assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the original problem, the user wrote \"Prove that for every integer n...\", but the formatted assumption added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like an error? Wait, maybe the example was incorrect? Wait, no, looking back: the example given by the user was:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumption: $n$ is an integer, $n$ is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that seems contradictory. The original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. But perhaps the example was incorrect. Maybe the user made a mistake there. Because if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", then the assumption shouldn't include that n is divisible by 7. Unless perhaps the user intended to filter some unrelated info, but in the example, maybe there was a typo. Hmm, but the user is asking me to follow their example. But in the problem given here, the conjecture is stated for n ≥ 0, and k=1,2,3,...\n\nSo for the current problem, the assumptions should include:\n\n- n is a non-negative integer.\n\n- k is a positive integer (k=1,2,3,...).\n\n- y_{n,k} is defined as the square of the k-th zero of the Bessel function J_n.\n\n- The sum S_{n,k} is independent of k.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the sums \"are independent of k and have rational values for integer n\". So that's part of the problem's conditions. So perhaps the assumptions should list:\n\n- For each integer n ≥ 0, the sum S_{n,k} is independent of k.\n\nBut maybe the user wants to list explicit assumptions. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But that seems conflicting. Maybe the example is wrong, but the user provided it, so perhaps in their example, they intended to filter out the assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, perhaps the original problem had a hidden assumption? But the user's example's original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". That must be a mistake. So perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user wants me to follow their format.\n\nIn any case, for the current problem, the conjecture is stated for arbitrary n ≥ 0 and k=1,2,3,..., so the assumptions should be:\n\n1. n is a non-negative integer.\n\n2. k is a positive integer.\n\n3. y_{n,k} = (BesselJZero[n,k])².\n\n4. The sum S_{n,k} is independent of k.\n\nWait, but the problem says that \"after some experimentation I found that the sums ... are independent of k and have rational values for integer n\". So the problem's conjecture is based on that observation, so the conjecture is that S_{n,k} = (n+1)/8. So the assumptions are the conditions under which the conjecture is made. The conjecture is for arbitrary n ≥ 0 and k=1,2,..., and the conjecture is that the sum equals (n+1)/8. So the assumptions are:\n\n- n is a non-negative integer.\n\n- k is a positive integer.\n\n- y_{n,k} is the square of the k-th zero of J_n.\n\nBut the problem is to prove the conjecture. The problem statement includes the conjecture as the problem. So the formatted problem should list the assumptions and then the problem as the conjecture.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nn is a non-negative integer,\n\nk is a positive integer,\n\ny_{n,k} is the square of the k-th zero of the Bessel function Jₙ,\n\nThe sum S_{n,k} is independent of k.\n\nBut wait, the independence of k is part of the conjecture, not an assumption. Wait, the problem states that the user found numerically that the sums are independent of k and have rational values. So the conjecture is that S_{n,k} = (n+1)/8, which includes that it's independent of k. So the assumptions would be the given conditions, not the conjecture itself. So the assumptions are the conditions under which the problem is posed. The problem is to prove that under these conditions, the sum equals (n+1)/8.\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\nn is a non-negative integer,\n\nk is a positive integer,\n\ny_{n,k} is defined as (BesselJZero[n,k])².\n\nProblem: Prove that the sum S_{n,k} = sum_{m=1}^∞ [y_{n+1,m} y_{n,k} / (y_{n+1,m} - y_{n,k})³] equals (n+1)/8.\n\nWait, but the example included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So maybe the user wants to include all given constraints. In this case, the problem states \"for arbitrary n ≥ 0\", so n is non-negative, and k is any positive integer. The definition of y_{n,k} is part of the problem's setup.\n\nSo the assumptions should be:\n\n- n is a non-negative integer.\n\n- k is a positive integer.\n\n- y_{n,k} is the square of the k-th zero of the Bessel function Jₙ.\n\nEach on separate lines.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that the sum equals (n+1)/8.\n\nThe part about the sum being independent of k is part of the conjecture, so it's part of the problem statement, not an assumption. So the problem is to prove that the sum equals (n+1)/8, which inherently includes that it's independent of k.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\nn is a non-negative integer,\n\nk is a positive integer,\n\ny_{n,k} is the square of the k-th zero of the Bessel function Jₙ.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that $$\\sum_{m=1}^\\infty\\frac{y_{n+1,m}y_{n,k}}{[y_{n+1,m}-y_{n,k}]^3} = \\frac{n+1}{8}.$$\n\nYes, that seems right. The user's example included the assumption that n is divisible by 7 even though the original problem didn't state that, but maybe that was a mistake.
