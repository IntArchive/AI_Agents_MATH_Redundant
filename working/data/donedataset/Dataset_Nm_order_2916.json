    "Content": "(I should say at the outset that this question is broad, and may need splitting up. Although I ask several questions, I present them as one because they are not independent of one another, and I am seeking a unified answer.) My questions  are: How can we establish that the circumference $C$ and area $A$  of a circle of radius $r$ satisfy $C = 2\\pi r$ and $A = \\pi r^2$ for some constant, $\\pi$? How can we prove that $\\pi$ is an element of the real field (e.g., a Dedekind cut)? How can we prove (perhaps trivial, if the above are satisfied) that there are real functions $\\sin(x)$ and $\\cos(x)$, which have the usual analytic properties, and also satisfy the usual geometric intuition? It seems like most calculus textbooks sort of weasel out on these questions. Usually, they ignore the first two questions pretty much completely, and their derivation on the third point is a filling-out of the following outline: (1) Define $\\sin(x)$ as height of triangle of central angle $x$ inscribed in the unit circle, where $x$ is in radians, and $\\cos(x)$ as the length of its base. Assume the usual values for these functions at $k(\\frac{\\pi}{2}), k \\in \\mathbb{N}$. (2) Notice, by assuming (a) that $A = \\pi r^2$ and $C = 2\\pi r$, and (b) that the area of a sector is proportionate to the length of arc subtended by the angle on the circumference, that the area $S$ of a sector of angle $x$ in a unit circle is $\\frac{x}{2}$, since $$\\frac{S}{\\pi r^2} = \\frac{x}{2 \\pi r}, r = 1 \\implies S = \\frac{x}{2}$$\n(Apparently, assumption (b) is Euclid VI 33 . I haven't studied the proof, though.) (3) Prove, using a geometric argument, that $\\frac{\\sin(x)}{2} < \\frac{x}{2} < \\frac{\\tan(x)}{2}$ for $x \\in [0,\\frac{\\pi}{2})$. Deal similarly (not identically) with $(\\frac{-\\pi}{2}, 0]$. Prove that we always have $1 > \\frac{\\sin(x)}{x} > \\cos(x)$ on $(\\frac{-\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$. (4) Derive (by a geometric argument, as done here ) the usual angle addition formulas. (5) Noting that $|\\sin(x)| < |x|$ (geometrically), conclude that $\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\sin(x) = 0$. Use the identity - derived from (4) - that $$\\cos(x) = 1 - 2\\sin^2(\\frac{x}{2}) = (1 - \\sqrt{2}\\sin(\\frac{x}{2}))(1 + \\sqrt{2}\\sin(\\frac{x}{2}))$$ and the product theorem for limits to conclude that $\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\cos(x) = 1$. (6) Use the \"Squeeze Theorem\" and (3) to prove that $\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{\\sin(x)}{x} = 1$, $\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{\\cos(x) - 1}{x} = 0$. Use (4) and (5) to establish continuity at all other values - e.g., $$\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\sin(x_0 + h) = \\lim_{h \\to 0}\\sin(x_0)\\cos(h) + \\sin(h)\\cos(x_0) = \\sin(x_0)$$ (7) Now prove that $\\sin(x), \\cos(x)$ are differentiable. A notably different approach is that of Spivak's Calculus . Spivak tacitly assumes that the first question has been answered, and notices that in that case, $$ \\pi = 2\\int_{-1}^{1} \\sqrt{1-x^2} dx $$ which resolves the second question, albeit not too directly. Also assuming that the area of a sector of an angle of $x$ radians is $\\frac{x}{2}$, he defines $$ A(x) = \\frac{x \\sqrt{1- x^2}}{2} + \\int_{x}^{1} \\sqrt{1-t^2} dt$$ The area function is a function of the $x$-coordinate, not an angle $x$; it tends from $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ to $0$ as $x$ goes from $-1$ to $1$. However, $\\forall x \\in [0, \\pi]$, we have $\\exists !y \\in [-1, 1]: A(y) = \\frac{x}{2}$; this $y$ we set as $\\cos(x)$, and we define $\\sin(x) = \\sqrt{1 - \\cos^2(x)}$. (The uniqueness of the value of $\\cos(x)$ is guaranteed by the fact that $A(x)$ is decreasing and continuous.) The remainder of Spivak's derivation is about extending these functions (by symmetry) to the rest of $\\mathbb{R}$. Although I am familiar with these derivations, they are rather prominently silent about the first question; I've never seen any answer to that question which impressed me as rigorous. I am not at all sure that there is an actual cut which one can write down (i.e., in set-builder notation, as an explicit subset of $\\mathbb{Q}$ in the usual way) for $\\pi$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The following answers your first question. We do not mention sine or cosine. We will use some basic integration techniques, but of course we will not use trigonometric substitution! Define the circle of radius $r$ with centre the origin by the equation $x^2+y^2=r^2$, and the disk by $x^2+y^2\\le r^2$. We first show that the area of a disk of radius $r$ is a constant times $r^2$. By symmetry the area is \n$$4\\int_0^r\\sqrt{r^2-x^2}\\,dx.$$\nMake the change of variable $x=rt$. Our area is\n$$r^2\\left(4\\int_0^1 \\sqrt{1-t^2}\\,dt\\right).$$\nThus $4\\int_0^1 \\sqrt{1-t^2}\\,dt$ is the desired constant.  We could call it $\\pi$. But let us call it $4k$. For the circumference, the usual arclength formula, after some simplification, gives that the circumference is\n$$4\\int_0^r \\frac{r\\,dx}{\\sqrt{r^2-x^2}}.$$\nThe change of variable $x=rt$ transforms this to \n$$r\\left(4\\int_0^1 \\frac{dt}{\\sqrt{1-t^2}}\\right).$$\nSo we have $r$ times a constant. Which constant? We will evaluate $\\int_0^1\\sqrt{1-t^2}\\,dt$ (yes!) in a funny way, by parts.\nLet $u=\\sqrt{1-t^2}$ and $dv=dt$. Then $du=-\\frac{t}{\\sqrt{1-t^2}}\\,dt$ and $v=t$. After a little while we find that\n$$\\int_0^1\\sqrt{1-t^2}\\,dt=\\int_0^1 \\frac{t^2\\,dt}{\\sqrt{1-t^2}}.$$\nBut the numerator on the right is $1-(1-t^2)$. And $\\dfrac{1-t^2}{\\sqrt{1-t^2}}=\\sqrt{1-t^2}$. Thus\n$$\\int_0^1\\sqrt{1-t^2}\\,dt=\\int_0^1 \\frac{dt}{\\sqrt{1-t^2}}-\\int_0^1\\sqrt{1-t^2}\\,dt.$$\nWe conclude that \n$$\\int_0^1 \\frac{dt}{\\sqrt{1-t^2}}=2\\int_0^1\\sqrt{1-t^2}\\,dt=2k.$$\nIt follows that the circumference of a circle of radius $r$ is $8kr$. Remark: One can introduce the trigonometric functions via integrals, as mentioned in the OP.  Then their basic properties, such as the addition laws,  are not difficult to derive. It is, however, mildly tedious.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me start by reading through the original problem carefully. The user has several questions bundled together, but they want them presented in a unified way. The main topics are establishing the circumference and area formulas for a circle involving π, proving π is a real number (like a Dedekind cut), and showing that the sine and cosine functions have both analytic properties and geometric intuition. They also mention calculus textbooks' approaches and Spivak's method.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The user mentions several conditions and properties. Let me parse each part:\n\n1. The problem is about proving C = 2πr and A = πr² for a circle of radius r.\n2. Proving π is an element of the real field (e.g., a Dedekind cut).\n3. Proving the existence of real functions sin(x) and cos(x) with analytic properties and geometric intuition.\n4. The user references calculus textbooks that ignore the first two questions and outline an approach using geometric arguments and limits.\n5. Spivak's approach assumes the first question is answered and defines π via an integral, then defines trigonometric functions using area functions.\n\nSo the assumptions would need to list each condition applied to one object. Let me list possible assumptions:\n\n- The circumference C and area A of a circle with radius r satisfy C = 2πr and A = πr² for some constant π.\n- π is an element of the real numbers (defined as a Dedekind cut).\n- There exist real functions sin(x) and cos(x) with usual analytic properties (like continuity, differentiability, angle addition formulas) and geometric interpretations.\n- The area of a sector is proportional to the length of its subtended arc (Euclid VI.33).\n- The limits involving sin(x)/x and (cos(x)-1)/x as x approaches 0 are established using the squeeze theorem.\n- Trigonometric functions are defined using the unit circle approach, assuming values at multiples of π/2.\n- Using integrals to define π and inverse trigonometric functions (as in Spivak's method).\n\nWait, but each assumption should address only one property applied to one object. Let me break it down:\n\nAssumption 1: The circumference C of a circle with radius r is proportional to its radius. (Leads to C = 2πr)\nAssumption 2: The area A of a circle with radius r is proportional to the square of its radius. (Leads to A = πr²)\nAssumption 3: The constant π is defined as a real number via a Dedekind cut.\nAssumption 4: The area of a sector is proportional to its subtended arc length. (Euclid VI.33)\nAssumption 5: The functions sin(x) and cos(x) are defined geometrically using the unit circle.\nAssumption 6: The limits lim_{x→0} sin(x)/x = 1 and lim_{x→0} (cos(x)-1)/x = 0 are established using the squeeze theorem.\nAssumption 7: Trigonometric identities (angle addition formulas) are derived geometrically.\nAssumption 8: π is defined via an integral, such as π = 2∫_{-1}^1 sqrt(1 - x²) dx.\n\nWait, but the original problem is asking how to establish these things, not assuming them. The user is pointing out that textbooks assume some of these. So perhaps the assumptions are the ones that the textbooks make, which the user is questioning. For example, the problem mentions that textbooks assume the area of a sector is proportionate to the arc length. So in the problem statement, the user is seeking to prove these, but the textbooks' approaches make certain assumptions. Therefore, the assumptions here would be the premises that the problem is built upon, which might be what the user is pointing out as assumed in textbooks.\n\nLooking back at the example given in the problem format, the original problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91, and in the formatted version, the assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So the assumptions are the given conditions of the problem.\n\nIn this case, the user's problem is to establish C=2πr, A=πr², π as a real number, and the properties of sin/cos. But the problem statement refers to the methods used in textbooks which make certain assumptions. Therefore, the assumptions in the formatted problem would be the conditions that the problem is starting from. However, since the user is asking how to prove these things, perhaps the assumptions are the foundational axioms or prior knowledge needed. But the example given had specific assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the user is asking for proofs of these formulas and properties, so the assumptions would be the premises that these proofs rely on. But the user is pointing out that textbooks make certain assumptions (like Euclid VI.33 for proportionality of sector area to arc length, assuming the area formula, etc.), so maybe those are the assumptions to list.\n\nLet me re-examine the original question's text:\n\nThe user's questions are:\n\n1. How to establish C=2πr and A=πr²?\n2. How to prove π is a real number (Dedekind cut)?\n3. How to prove sin and cos have analytic properties and geometric intuition?\n\nThe user describes the usual textbook approach which assumes (a) A=πr² and C=2πr, and (b) sector area is proportional to arc length (Euclid VI.33). So these are assumptions made in the textbooks, but the user wants to prove them. Therefore, in the formatted problem, perhaps the assumptions are those that the problem is based on, but the user is questioning. Wait, no—the problem is to prove those things, so maybe the assumptions are the given conditions or definitions. Alternatively, the problem might not have assumptions, but the user is asking how to establish these from more foundational principles. However, in the example given, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7. So perhaps here, the problem is to prove the circumference and area formulas with π, and the assumptions are the conditions under which this is to be proven. However, the user is pointing out that textbooks make certain assumptions, so perhaps those are the assumptions we need to list.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is structured as follows: The user is asking to prove C=2πr and A=πr², define π as a real number, and establish sin/cos properties. The textbooks' approaches make certain assumptions (like assuming A=πr² and sector proportionality), which the user is considering as given. So in the formatted problem, the assumptions would be those that the textbooks use, which the problem is based on. For example:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The area of a circle is to be proven as A = πr².\n- The circumference is to be proven as C = 2πr.\n- π is a real number defined via a Dedekind cut.\n- The functions sin(x) and cos(x) are defined geometrically on the unit circle.\n- The area of a sector is proportional to its subtended arc length (Euclid VI.33).\n- The limits lim_{x→0} sin(x)/x = 1 and lim_{x→0} (cos(x)-1)/x = 0 are established using the squeeze theorem.\n- Trigonometric addition formulas are derived geometrically.\n\nBut the problem is to prove these, so the assumptions might be the premises that these proofs rely on. However, the user is pointing out that the textbooks skip some proofs and assume others. For instance, they mention that textbooks assume A=πr² and C=2πr, and then derive properties of sine and cosine. So perhaps the problem is to prove these formulas (C and A) and the properties of sin/cos, given some more foundational assumptions. But the user is not stating any explicit assumptions beyond what is in the problem. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to answer how to establish these formulas and properties, without given assumptions, so the assumptions part might be minimal. But according to the example, the formatted problem extracted assumptions from the original problem. In the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91, and the formatted version listed n is an integer and n divisible by 7. Wait, in the example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem listed assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so why is the assumption that n is divisible by 7? That seems like a mistake. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that seems incorrect. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should just be that n is an integer, but in the formatted example, they added \"n is divisible by 7\", which is not in the original. Maybe there was a mistake in the example. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem had a typo, and the formatted version is correct. But assuming the example is correct as given, perhaps the user made a mistake in their example.\n\nBut regardless, following the user's instructions, the task is to read the Math Stack Exchange question, filter unrelated info, and structure it into Assumptions and Problem. The example shows that even if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem lists assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But that seems contradictory. Maybe the example is wrong, but we need to follow the user's format.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's questions are how to establish C=2πr, A=πr², define π as a real number, and prove properties of sin and cos. The user mentions that textbooks assume certain things, like the area formula and sector proportionality. So perhaps the assumptions to list are those that the problem relies on, which the user is pointing out. For example:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The circumference C of a circle is proportional to its radius r.\n- The area A of a circle is proportional to the square of its radius r.\n- The constant of proportionality (π) is a real number defined via a Dedekind cut.\n- The area of a sector is proportional to the length of its subtended arc (Euclid VI.33).\n- The functions sin(x) and cos(x) are defined as the y-coordinate and x-coordinate of a point on the unit circle.\n- The limits lim_{x→0} sin(x)/x = 1 and lim_{x→0} (cos(x)-1)/x = 0 can be proven using the squeeze theorem.\n- Angle addition formulas for sin and cos can be derived geometrically.\n\nBut each assumption should be one property applied to one object. Let me try to break it down line by line:\n\nAssumption:\nThe circumference of a circle is proportional to its radius,\nThe area of a circle is proportional to the square of its radius,\nThe constant of proportionality (π) is an element of the real numbers (e.g., a Dedekind cut),\nThe area of a sector is proportional to the length of its subtended arc,\nThe sine function is defined as the y-coordinate of a point on the unit circle,\nThe cosine function is defined as the x-coordinate of a point on the unit circle,\nThe limits $\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{\\sin(x)}{x} = 1$ and $\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{\\cos(x) - 1}{x} = 0$ can be established using the Squeeze Theorem,\nAngle addition formulas for sine and cosine can be derived geometrically.\n\nBut the problem is to prove these things, not assume them. Wait, but perhaps the problem is asking for proofs starting from certain foundational assumptions. For example, to prove that C=2πr, one might start with the assumption that circumference is proportional to radius, and then define π as the constant. However, the user is asking how to establish that π exists as a real number. So maybe the assumptions are more foundational, like the properties of circles, limits, etc.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might not have explicit assumptions, but the user is asking to prove these statements from more basic principles. However, the format requires listing assumptions. In the example, assumptions were listed even though the original problem didn't state them (it was a mistake in the example). Given that, perhaps for the current problem, the assumptions are the ones that the problem implicitly relies on, such as:\n\n- The real numbers are constructed via Dedekind cuts.\n- The trigonometric functions are to be defined analytically and geometrically.\n- The area and circumference formulas for circles are to be proven.\n\nBut this is vague. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to prove these statements under the assumptions that certain geometric properties hold. For example, Euclid's propositions.\n\nGiven the user's description, the textbooks assume (a) A = πr² and C = 2πr, and (b) sector area is proportional to arc length. So these would be assumptions in the textbooks' derivations. Therefore, the problem is to prove the analytic properties of sin and cos given these assumptions, but the user wants to know how to prove (a) and (b) in the first place.\n\nHence, structuring the problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The circumference of a circle is proportional to its radius,\n- The area of a circle is proportional to the square of its radius,\n- The area of a sector is proportional to the length of its subtended arc,\n- The real numbers are constructed using Dedekind cuts,\n- The functions sin(x) and cos(x) are defined geometrically on the unit circle,\n- The limits of sin(x)/x and (cos(x)-1)/x as x approaches 0 can be evaluated using the Squeeze Theorem,\n- Angle addition formulas for sine and cosine can be derived from geometric arguments.\n\nProblem:\nProve that for a circle of radius r, the circumference C and area A satisfy C = 2πr and A = πr² with π being a real number (constructed as a Dedekind cut), and establish that the real functions sin(x) and cos(x) have the usual analytic properties and geometric interpretations.\n\nBut the user's exact questions are:\n\n1. Establish C = 2πr and A = πr².\n2. Prove π is a real number (Dedekind cut).\n3. Prove sin and cos have analytic properties and geometric intuition.\n\nSo combining these into the problem statement.\n\nThus, after careful consideration, the formatted problem should have assumptions listed as the conditions or properties used in the proofs (like proportionality, Dedekind cuts existence, geometric definitions of trig functions, etc.), each as a single line.",
