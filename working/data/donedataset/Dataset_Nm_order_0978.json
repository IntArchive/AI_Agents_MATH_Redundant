    "Content": "Let $\\mathcal{P}_0(X)$ the Power set of $X$ without the empty set and let $\\dot{x}:=\\{A\\subseteq X: x \\in A\\}$ the one point filter generated by $x$ . Furtermore let $$ \\mathcal{A} := \\{ f \\in X^{\\mathcal{P}_0(X)} : \\ \\forall A \\in \\mathcal{P}_0(X): f(A) \\in A\\} $$ be the set of the functions mapping subsets of the power set to elements of them. Let $\\varphi$ be a filter on $\\mathcal{P}_0(X)$ with $$\\forall f \\in \\mathcal{A} \\exists x_f \\in X : f[\\varphi]=\\dot{x}_f.$$ Here $f[\\varphi]$ stands for the filter generated from the filter basis: $$  \\{ \\operatorname{image} f|_M \\ : \\ M \\in \\varphi\\}$$ It seems like our definition of filter is not the standard definition, to avoid confusion $\\varphi \\subset \\mathcal{P}(\\mathcal{P}(X))$ Now we shall show that if $X=\\mathbb{Z}$ , then it follows that $\\varphi$ is a one point filter.  From the given property we already can conclude that $\\varphi$ is an ultrafilter but I don't know what I shall do next, could someone give me a hint? As it was asked for in the comments, our definition of a filter is: Let $S$ be a set (an arbitrary one), and $A,B\\subseteq S$ . We call $\\varphi\\subset \\mathcal{P}(S)$ a filter when the following holds $\\varnothing\\notin \\varphi$ $A,B\\in \\varphi \\implies A\\cap B \\in \\varphi$ $A\\subset B $ and $A\\in \\varphi \\implies B\\in \\varphi$ An ultrafilter is a filter, such that there is no bigger filter, e.g. when $G$ is a filter and $F$ is an ultra filter and $G\\supseteq F\\implies G=F$ . More convenient is the equivalence that for every subset $A$ of $S$ it holds that $A\\in F \\vee S\\setminus A \\in F$ . The one point filter is already defined in the first sentence. I posted the question on MathOverflow were someone wrote the answer.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Please note that the following is not my answer nor my idea but the one of Joseph Van Name, who posted this answer on MathOverflow and I just copy his answer here for completeness. For this problem, we shall use $\\mathbb{N}$ instead of $\\mathbb{Z}$ since $\\mathbb{N}$ is easier to work with in this case. We shall say that $A$ has property $P$ almost everywhere (or for almost all $A$) abbreviated a.e. if $\\{A\\in P_{0}(X)|A\\,\\textrm{has property}\\,P\\}\\in\\varphi$. For $n>0$, let $f_{n}\\in\\mathcal{A}$ be the function where if $A\\in P_{0}(\\mathbb{N})$ then $f_{n}(A)$ is the $n$-th element of $A$ whenever $|A|\\geq n$ and $f_{n}(A)$ is the last element of $A$ whenever $|A|<n$. Let $y_{n}=x_{f_{n}}$. Then $f_{n}(A)=y_{n}$ for almost every $n$. If $i<j$, then clearly $y_{i}\\leq y_{j}$. Furthermore, if $y_{n}=y_{n+1}$, then $f_{1}(A)=y_{1},...,f_{n+1}(A)=y_{n+1}$ for almost every $A\\in P_{0}(\\mathbb{N})$. However, if $f_{1}(A)=y_{1},...,f_{n+1}(A)=y_{n+1}$, then $A=\\{y_{1},...,y_{n+1}\\}$ making $\\varphi$ a principal ultrafilter. We shall therefore assume that $y_{n}<y_{n+1}$ for all $n$. We claim that $\\varphi$ is an ultrafilter. Let $S=\\{A\\in P_{0}(X)|f_{1}(A)=y_{1},f_{2}(A)=y_{2}\\}$. Then clearly $S\\in\\varphi$. Let $R\\subseteq P_{0}(X)$. Let $h\\in\\mathcal{A}$ be a function where $h(A)=y_{1}$ for each $A\\in R\\cap S$ and $h(A)=y_{2}$ for each $A\\in R^{c}\\cap S$. Then the function $h$ is constant almost everywhere. It is clear that $h(A)=y_{1}$ a.e. or $h(A)=y_{2}$ a.e. If $h(A)=y_{1}$ almost everywhere, then $R\\cap S\\in\\varphi$. If $h(A)=y_{2}$ a.e., then $R^{c}\\cap S\\in\\varphi$. Therefore, we conclude that either $R\\in\\varphi$ or $R^{c}\\in\\varphi$. Therefore $\\varphi$ is an ultrafilter. We shall now prove that $\\varphi$ is a principal ultrafilter. Assume for the sake of contradiction that $\\varphi$ is a non-principal ultrafilter. Let $Y=\\{y_{n}|n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\}$. We claim that $Y\\not\\subseteq A$ for almost every $A$. To prove this assume that $Y\\subseteq A$ for almost every $A$. Then the ultrafilter $\\varphi$ is $\\sigma$-complete. To see this, let $T=\\{A\\in P(X)|Y\\subseteq A\\}$, and let $P=\\{R_{n}|n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\}$ be a partition of $T$ into countably many pieces. Let $g\\in\\mathcal{A}$ be a function where if $A\\in R_{n}$, then $g(A)=y_{n}$. Then the function $g$ is constant almost everywhere. In particular, $g(A)=y_{n}$ for almost every $A$. However, this implies that $R_{n}\\in\\varphi$ for some $n$ making the ultrafilter $\\varphi$ $\\sigma$-complete. On the other hand, it is well known that there are no non-principal $\\sigma$-ultrafilters on $P_{0}(\\mathbb{N})$ since $|P_{0}(\\mathbb{N})|$ is far below the first measurable cardinal if one even exists. We conclude that $Y\\not\\subseteq A$ for almost every $A$. Now let $t\\in\\mathcal{A}$ be a function where if $y_{1}\\in A\\subseteq\\mathbb{N}$ and $Y\\not\\subseteq A$, then $t(A)=y_{n}$ where $y_{n+1}\\not\\in A$. Then $t(A)=y_{n}$ for almost all $A\\in P_{0}(X)$. Then the function $t$ is constant almost everywhere. In particular, $t(A)=y_{n}$ for almost all $A\\in P_{0}(X)$. However, this implies that $y_{n+1}\\not\\in A$ for almost all $n$. This contradicts the fact that $f_{n+1}(A)=y_{n+1}$ for almost every $A\\in P_{0}(X)$. We therefore conclude that $\\varphi$ can only be a principal ultrafilter.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to show that a certain filter on the power set of ℤ is a one-point filter. Let me parse through the given information and structure it properly.\n\nFirst, let's outline the assumptions. The problem mentions several definitions and conditions. Starting with the setup: X is the set of integers, so X = ℤ. The filter φ is defined on 𝒫₀(X), which is the power set without the empty set. The one-point filter ẋ consists of all subsets containing x. Then there's this set 𝒜 of functions f where each f(A) is an element of A for every non-empty A. The key condition given is that for every function f in 𝒜, there exists an x_f in X such that the filter generated by f[φ] is the one-point filter at x_f. The goal is to show that φ itself must be a one-point filter.\n\nThe user also mentions that φ is an ultrafilter, which they derived from the given property. They need help proceeding from there. The definitions provided clarify that a filter here follows the standard closure under intersection, supersets, and not containing the empty set. An ultrafilter is maximal and has the property that for any subset A, either A or its complement is in the filter.\n\nSo, the main assumptions to list would include X being ℤ, φ being a filter on 𝒫₀(X) with the given property about functions in 𝒜 generating one-point filters. Also, φ is an ultrafilter. The problem is to show φ is a one-point filter.\n\nWait, but the original problem states that X=ℤ, so that's a specific case. The key assumption here is the condition on the functions in 𝒜 leading to one-point filters. Also, φ is a filter as per their definition.\n\nLet me check the example given by the user. In their example, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the formatted version, they listed each assumption line by line. So, each assumption should be a single condition applied to one object.\n\nSo, breaking down the problem:\n\nAssumption 1: X = ℤ (the problem specifies this).\n\nAssumption 2: φ is a filter on 𝒫₀(X) (the power set without the empty set).\n\nAssumption 3: For every function f in 𝒜 (where 𝒜 consists of functions selecting an element from each non-empty subset), there exists x_f in X such that f[φ] is the one-point filter at x_f.\n\nAdditionally, the problem mentions φ is an ultrafilter. Wait, but the user says \"From the given property we already can conclude that φ is an ultrafilter\". So, the fact that φ is an ultrafilter is a conclusion from the given assumptions, not an assumption itself. Therefore, in the formatted problem, we should only list the given assumptions, not the derived ones. So the assumptions are X=ℤ, φ is a filter on 𝒫₀(X), and the condition on the functions f in 𝒜 generating one-point filters. The problem then is to show φ is a one-point filter.\n\nAlso, the user's definition of a filter includes the standard three axioms: non-empty, closed under supersets and finite intersections. But since the problem states \"our definition of a filter\", but the formatted problem's assumptions don't need to include the general definition of a filter, since that's part of the background knowledge. Unless the problem uses a non-standard definition, but in the user's note, they mention that their definition is standard except φ is a subset of 𝒫(𝒫(X)), which might be a point to note. Wait, the user says: \"to avoid confusion φ ⊂ 𝒫(𝒫(X))\". So φ is a subset of the power set of the power set of X. That's because in their setup, φ is a filter on 𝒫₀(X), so elements of φ are subsets of 𝒫₀(X), hence φ is a subset of 𝒫(𝒫(X)). But is this an assumption to list? The problem says \"φ is a filter on 𝒫₀(X)\", so perhaps that's already covered.\n\nSo compiling the assumptions:\n\n- X is the set of integers, X = ℤ.\n\n- φ is a filter on 𝒫₀(X) (i.e., φ ⊆ 𝒫(𝒫₀(X)), satisfying the filter axioms: non-empty, closed under supersets and finite intersections, and not containing ∅).\n\n- For every function f ∈ 𝒜 (where 𝒜 is the set of choice functions selecting f(A) ∈ A for each A ∈ 𝒫₀(X)), there exists x_f ∈ X such that f[φ] is the one-point filter generated by x_f.\n\nThe problem is to show that φ is a one-point filter.\n\nSo in the formatted problem, each assumption is a separate line. Let me check the example again. The example had:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nSo each assumption is a single condition. So here, similarly:\n\nAssumption:\n\nX = ℤ,\n\nφ is a filter on 𝒫₀(X),\n\nFor all f ∈ 𝒜, there exists x_f ∈ X such that f[φ] = ẋ_f.\n\nProblem: Show that φ is a one-point filter.\n\nYes, that seems right. The key is to extract the given conditions, not the derived ones like φ being an ultrafilter. The user mentions they already know φ is an ultrafilter, but that's a consequence of the assumptions, not an assumption itself.\n\nSo the formatted problem should list the three assumptions as above. The problem is to show φ is a one-point filter.",
