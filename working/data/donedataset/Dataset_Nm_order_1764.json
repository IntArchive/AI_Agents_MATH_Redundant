    "Content": "Experimenting with WA I noticed that the function $1- \\cos^{\\frac{2}{3}}x$ has the Maclaurin expansion with all coefficients positive ( works for any exponent in $[0, \\frac{2}{3}]$ ). A trivial conclusion from this is $|\\cos x|\\le 1$ , but it implies more than that, for instance see this .  Maybe   some ''natural'' proofs are available.  Thank you for your interest! Note: an attempt  used a differential equation satisfied by the function. But the answer by @metamorphy just solved it the right way. $\\bf{Added:}$ Some comments about series with positive coefficients. By $P$ we denote a series with positive coefficients ( no free term), If $a>0$ then $\\frac{1}{(1-P)^a} = 1+P$ (moreover, the positive expression on RHS is a polynomial in $a$ with positive coefficients If $0<a < 1$ then $(1-P)^a = 1-P$ . Similarly the expressions for $a = \\frac{t}{t+1}$ are positive in $t$ . 2'. If $1-f= P$ then $1- f^{a} =P$ for any $0 < a < 1$ , and similar with above. $\\bf{Added:}$ It turns out that the function $\\cos^{2/3} x$ has a continued fraction (an $S$ -fraction, from Stieltjes) that is \"positive\" ( similar to the continued fraction for $\\tan x$ ). This is a stronger statement than the one before. Maybe there is some approach  using hypergeometric functions.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "(A proof, not very \"natural\" though.) $f(x)=1-\\cos^{2/3}x$ satisfies $xf''(x)=g(x)f'(x)$ , where $$g(x)=x\\cot x+\\frac{x}3\\tan x=1+\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty g_n x^n$$ with $g_n=0$ for odd $n$ , and $3g_{2n}=(-1)^n 2^{2n}(4-2^{2n})B_{2n}/(2n)!\\geqslant 0$ using Bernoulli numbers (and the alternating-sign property of these). Now $f'(x)=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty f_n x^n$ implies $(n-1)f_n=\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}g_{n-k}f_k$ , giving $f_n\\geqslant 0$ by induction.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to format this Math Stack Exchange question according to the user's specified structure. Let me start by reading through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe title is \"Maclaurin series of $1- \\cos^{2/3} x$ has all coefficients positive\". The question mentions that experimenting with Wolfram Alpha (WA), the user noticed that the Maclaurin expansion of $1 - \\cos^{2/3}x$ has all coefficients positive, particularly for exponents in the interval $[0, 2/3]$. They also mention some conclusions and related attempts, including using a differential equation and a reference to an answer by metamorphy. There are some added comments about series with positive coefficients and continued fractions.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the core problem and list the assumptions. The main problem seems to be proving that the Maclaurin series of $1 - \\cos^{2/3}x$ has all coefficients positive. The user specifies that this works for exponents in $[0, 2/3]$, so that's an important condition. However, in the original problem statement, the user might have focused on the exponent 2/3, but mentions the interval as a condition. The example provided by the user in their formatting includes assumptions about the objects involved. \n\nLooking at the example given, the assumptions were about the variable (n being an integer, and n divisible by 7). In this case, the assumptions would likely be about the exponent in the function. The function in question is $1 - \\cos^{a}x$ where $a$ is in the interval $[0, 2/3]$. However, the main problem as stated in the title specifically refers to $a = 2/3$, but the question mentions that it works for any exponent in that interval. So perhaps the assumption is that the exponent is in $[0, 2/3]$, and the problem is to prove that all Maclaurin series coefficients are positive.\n\nAdditionally, the problem mentions that this is observed for the exponent in $[0, 2/3]$, so the assumption is that the exponent a is within that interval. The function in the problem is $1 - \\cos^{a}x$, and the problem is to show its Maclaurin series has all coefficients positive. \n\nThe user also added some notes about differential equations and continued fractions, but those might be part of their attempts or additional context, which we need to filter out. The core problem is to prove the positivity of the coefficients in the Maclaurin series for $1 - \\cos^{a}x$ when $a$ is in $[0, 2/3]$. \n\nSo, the assumptions should be:\n\n1. The exponent $a$ is a real number.\n2. The exponent $a$ is in the interval $[0, 2/3]$.\n\nThe problem is then to prove that the Maclaurin series of $1 - \\cos^{a}x$ has all coefficients positive.\n\nWait, but in the original title, the specific exponent is 2/3, but the question mentions that this works for any exponent in $[0, 2/3]$. Therefore, the problem statement should reflect that generality. However, the title specifically mentions 2/3, so perhaps the problem as stated is about exponent 2/3, but the user is noting that it works for the interval. The example given in the user's instruction had assumptions that were specific (n is integer, n divisible by 7). So in this case, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- $a$ is a real number in the interval $[0, 2/3]$.\n\nBut the main problem in the title is about $a = 2/3$, but the user's question states that it works for any exponent in that interval. Therefore, the problem should be to prove that for $a$ in $[0, 2/3]$, the Maclaurin series of $1 - \\cos^{a}x$ has all coefficients positive. However, the title specifically mentions 2/3. The user might have intended the problem to be about the specific exponent 2/3, but their explanation broadens it to the interval. To resolve this, perhaps the problem statement includes the interval, but the original title is more specific. \n\nGiven the user's instruction to filter unrelated information, the main problem is as per the title but the user adds that it works for exponents in the interval. Therefore, the correct formatting would include the interval as an assumption. Let me check the original question again:\n\n\"the function $1- \\cos^{\\frac{2}{3}}x$ has the Maclaurin expansion with all coefficients positive ( works for any exponent in $[0, \\frac{2}{3}]$ ).\"\n\nSo the user is saying that for exponent 2/3, the Maclaurin series has all coefficients positive, and this also works for exponents in [0, 2/3]. Therefore, the problem is about the general case for exponents in that interval, with the specific example at 2/3. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- $a$ is a real number.\n- $a$ is in the interval $[0, \\frac{2}{3}]$.\n\nProblem: Prove that the Maclaurin series of $1 - \\cos^{a}x$ has all coefficients positive.\n\nAlternatively, if the original problem is to prove this for exponent 2/3, but the user mentions that it's true for any exponent in that interval, then the problem statement should include the interval. However, in the title, the user specifies 2/3, but the question body mentions the interval. Since the user wants to filter out unrelated information, perhaps the main problem is to prove it for exponents in [0, 2/3], with 2/3 being a case. Therefore, the correct assumptions are the two listed above, and the problem is as stated.\n\nAdditionally, the user's added notes about series with positive coefficients and continued fractions are probably context or attempts, which should be excluded. The core problem is about the Maclaurin coefficients being positive for the specified exponent range.",
