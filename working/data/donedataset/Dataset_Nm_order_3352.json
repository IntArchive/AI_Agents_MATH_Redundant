    "Content": "The question is: Prove that for every three non-zero integers, a,b and c, at least one of the three products ab,ac,bc is positive. Use proof by contradiction. My general approach to doing contradiction is as follow: I always like to turn the statements into propositional logic, with an implication. In this case it would be like: [For all a,b,c in the domain of non-zero integer If a,b and c are three non-zero integers], then at least one of the three products ab,ac,bc is positive. Then I take the negation of it: (P ^ ~Q) Assume to the contrary,there exist a,b and c that are non-zero integers and none of the three products ab,ac and bc are positive. Now, I pick a = 1,  b = -1 , c = 2 a.b = -1\na.c = 2\nb.c = -2 Since a.c is positive, our assumption is false and we have a contradiction. Hence, the original statement is true. Please feel free to share any other alternatives...(contradiction ones)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The product of three negative numbers is negative.  So if $ab$, $ac$, and $bc$ are all negative, then $(ab)(ac)(bc)\\lt0$.  But $(ab)(ac)(bc)=a^2b^2c^2$ is the product of three squares, which are all positive.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement from the original question.\n\nThe original problem is: Prove that for every three non-zero integers a, b, and c, at least one of the three products ab, ac, bc is positive. The user mentioned using proof by contradiction and provided an example approach. However, my task is to extract the assumptions and the problem statement, not the solution.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed as individual conditions. In this case, the problem states three non-zero integers a, b, c. Each of these is a separate assumption. So, the assumptions should be:\n\n1. a is a non-zero integer.\n2. b is a non-zero integer.\n3. c is a non-zero integer.\n\nThe problem then is to prove that at least one of ab, ac, bc is positive. The original question mentions using proof by contradiction, but according to the example given, the problem statement doesn't include the method (like contradiction) unless it's part of the problem's requirement. Here, the user's example didn't include the method in the formatted problem, just the statement to prove. So, the problem part should just state the requirement without mentioning the method.\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", and in the formatted problem, it listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption and also \"n is divisible by 7\" as another assumption. Wait, but in the original example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the formatted assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7. Wait, perhaps the example might have been from a different problem. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example given:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: \n- n is an integer,\n- n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption includes that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Because the original problem doesn't restrict n to being divisible by 7. Maybe there's a mistake in the example? Or perhaps the example is from a different problem where the user added an assumption? Hmm, perhaps the example was a mistake, but the user provided it as their own structuring. So, in that case, perhaps the assumptions are not just the given conditions but also any implicit assumptions. But this is confusing.\n\nWait, the user wants me to structure the problem as in the example. So, in the example, they took the original problem which was for every integer n, and then in the assumptions listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But that seems incorrect because the original problem didn't have n divisible by 7. Unless maybe there was a typo in the example. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem had a different condition. Wait, let me read again the example:\n\nOriginal problem in the example says: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut that contradicts because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption adds that n is divisible by 7. That seems like an error. Unless the user made a mistake in their example. But perhaps the example was from a different problem where the original problem had n divisible by 7. Maybe a miscommunication there. But regardless, I need to follow the user's example's structure.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question is: Prove that for every three non-zero integers a, b, and c, at least one of the three products ab, ac, bc is positive.\n\nFollowing the example's approach, the assumptions should list each condition on each object. So, the three variables a, b, c are each non-zero integers. Therefore, each is an assumption line:\n\nAssumption:\na is a non-zero integer,\nb is a non-zero integer,\nc is a non-zero integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that at least one of ab, ac, bc is positive.\n\nBut in the example, they had an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) which wasn't in the original problem. So, perhaps the user intended to list all conditions, including any that were implicit? Wait, no. The original example's problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is n is an integer. But the formatted problem includes \"n is divisible by 7\", which isn't in the original problem. That seems incorrect. Maybe the example was wrong. But perhaps the user intended that when structuring the problem, any additional conditions needed for the problem to hold should be listed as assumptions. But in the original problem, the problem holds for all integers n, but the formatted problem includes that n is divisible by 7. That would mean the answer in the example is incorrect. Maybe the user made a mistake in their example.\n\nBut regardless, for the current problem, the user wants to structure the problem as per the example. The original problem states that a, b, c are three non-zero integers. So, each is a non-zero integer. Therefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n- a is a non-zero integer,\n- b is a non-zero integer,\n- c is a non-zero integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that at least one of the products ab, ac, bc is positive.\n\nThat's straightforward. The original question mentions using proof by contradiction, but according to the example, the problem statement doesn't include the method. So, the problem is just the statement to prove, not the method. Hence, the formatted problem should just be the problem statement, and the assumptions are the given conditions.",
