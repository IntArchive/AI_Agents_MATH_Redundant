    "AcceptedAnswer": "It depends on how much complex analysis you know. Let me give you a short proof (using heavy machinery). If $f$ has an essential singularity at $\\infty$, it can't be injective on $\\mathbb{C}$ due to big Picard. If the singularity at $\\infty$ is removable, then $f$ is constant by Liouville. Hence $f$ has a pole at $\\infty$ which means that $f$ is a polynomial. If $\\deg f \\ge 2$, it won't be injective (fundamental theorem of algebra). That only leaves you with polynomials of degree exactly 1.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question according to the given format. Let me start by understanding the original problem.\n\nThe user is asking how to show that the automorphism group of the complex numbers, Aut(ℂ), consists exactly of functions of the form f(z) = az + b where a ≠ 0. They mention that an automorphism here is defined as a bijective entire function with an entire inverse. They note that functions of the form az + b are obviously in Aut(ℂ), but they want to prove the converse—that any such automorphism must be linear.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let's parse the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem defines Aut(ℂ) as the set of bijective entire functions with entire inverses. So the key assumptions here are about the function f:\n\n1. f: ℂ → ℂ is bijective. (Bijectivity)\n2. f is entire (holomorphic everywhere on ℂ). (Entire function)\n3. The inverse function f⁻¹ is also entire. (Entire inverse)\n\nThe problem then states that if f is of the form f(z) = az + b with a ≠ 0, then it's in Aut(ℂ). The converse needs to be proven: any automorphism (satisfying the above three conditions) must be linear of that form.\n\nSo the assumptions for the problem would be each of the three conditions listed separately. The problem is to show that under these assumptions, f must be linear, i.e., f(z) = az + b with a ≠ 0.\n\nWait, the original problem's example had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in this case, the problem is to show that any automorphism of ℂ (satisfying those properties) must be linear. So the assumptions are the properties that f must satisfy to be in Aut(ℂ). Each of those properties (bijective, entire, entire inverse) should be separate assumptions.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other implicit assumptions. The automorphism group is usually about structure-preserving maps. In complex analysis, an automorphism here is a biholomorphic map (holomorphic with holomorphic inverse), which is exactly what the problem states: bijective, entire, and entire inverse. So those three conditions are the assumptions.\n\nTherefore, structuring the problem:\n\nAssumption: \nf is a bijective function from ℂ to ℂ,\nf is entire,\nf⁻¹ is entire.\n\nProblem: Prove that f must be of the form f(z) = az + b with a ≠ 0.\n\nWait, but the original problem's example had each assumption as a separate line. So each line here is one assumption. So the user's example separated each condition into separate lines, even if they apply to the same object. For instance, in the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are separate lines even though both apply to n. Similarly, here, even though all assumptions apply to f, each property is a separate line. So:\n\nAssumption: \nf: ℂ → ℂ is bijective,\nf is entire,\nf⁻¹ is entire.\n\nProblem: Prove that f(z) = az + b with a ≠ 0.\n\nBut in the original problem statement, the user wrote the problem as \"Prove that Aut(ℂ) = {f | f(z)=az+b, a≠0}\". But according to the format, the problem should be stated as the problem to solve, given the assumptions.\n\nSo the problem here is to prove that any such f (satisfying the three assumptions) must be of the form az + b with a ≠ 0. Therefore, the problem statement would be: Prove that every automorphism of ℂ (i.e., bijective entire function with entire inverse) is of the form f(z) = az + b where a ≠ 0.\n\nI need to make sure that the problem is concise and captures the essence. The original problem mentions showing that Aut(ℂ) equals that set, so the problem can be phrased as proving that equality, but given the format, it's structured as \"Prove that f must be of the form...\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be written as: Show that Aut(ℂ) consists precisely of functions f(z) = az + b with a ≠ 0. But the user's example used the verb \"Prove that...\", so I should follow that.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together:\n\nAssumption: \nf: ℂ → ℂ is bijective,\nf is entire,\nf⁻¹ is entire.\n\nProblem: Prove that f(z) = az + b with a ≠ 0.\n\nBut perhaps the problem statement should include the definition of Aut(ℂ) as given in the question. Wait, the original question starts with \"How can it be shown that Aut(ℂ) = {f | f(z)=az+b, a≠0}\", where Aut(ℂ) is defined as bijective entire functions with entire inverses. So in the formatted problem, the assumptions would be the defining properties of Aut(ℂ), and the problem is to show the equality.\n\nBut according to the example, assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. In the example, the original problem had A(n) defined with 5^n and 6^n terms, and the user structured the assumptions as n being an integer and divisible by 7. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, the assumption added was \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, let me check the example again.\n\nThe example given by the user is:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: \nn is an integer,\nn is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Unless maybe there was a miscommunication. Wait, perhaps the example was a wrong example? Because if the original problem is for every integer n, the assumptions shouldn't include that n is divisible by 7. Unless the user made a mistake in the example. But assuming that the example is correct as per their instruction, perhaps they intended to structure it that way. Maybe in the original problem, there was a hidden assumption that n is divisible by 7, but that's unclear. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to extract the assumptions from the problem, but in the original problem, it's for all integers n, so the assumption is that n is an integer, and then the problem is to show divisibility by 91. But in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which changes the problem. That seems incorrect. Hmm.\n\nBut perhaps the example is not correctly formatted. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instructions as per their example. So in their example, they listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, even though the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7. That seems like an error. But perhaps the user intended to filter out unrelated information and list the key assumptions. Maybe in their example, they made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a typo, and the user corrected it.\n\nBut given that the user provided that example, I need to follow their approach. So, in their example, they added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, no, looking back: the original problem says \"for every integer n\", and the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, and then adds \"n is divisible by 7\". But why? Because 91 is 7*13, so perhaps the problem requires n to be divisible by both 7 and 13, but the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so that's conflicting. Maybe the example is wrong. But regardless, the user's example includes assumptions that may not be present in the original problem. Therefore, maybe the user's approach is to extract all conditions that are necessary, even if some are implicit.\n\nBut in our current problem, the user's question is about Aut(ℂ) being equal to the set of linear functions. The problem defines Aut(ℂ) as bijective entire functions with entire inverse. So the assumptions are that f is bijective, entire, and has an entire inverse. The problem is to show that such f must be linear.\n\nTherefore, following the example's structure, each assumption is a separate line, even if they all apply to the same object (f here). So:\n\nAssumption: \nf: ℂ → ℂ is bijective,\nf is entire,\nf⁻¹ is entire.\n\nProblem: Prove that f(z) = az + b with a ≠ 0.\n\nThat seems correct. Each assumption is one line, addressing one property. The problem is to show that under these conditions, f must be linear.",
