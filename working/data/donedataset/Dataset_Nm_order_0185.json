    "Content": "Is there a (preferably elementary) proof that the graph of the (discontinuous) function $y$ defined on $[0,1)$ by $$ y(x) =\\begin{cases}\n\\sin\\left(\\dfrac{1}{x}\\right) & \\mbox{if $0\\lt x \\lt 1$,}\\\\\\\n0 & \\mbox{if $x=0$,}\\end{cases}$$ is not path connected?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If $S=\\{(0,0)\\}\\cup\\{(x,\\sin(1/x)):0<x<1\\}$ and $f=(f_1,f_2):[0,1]\\to S$ is a path with $f(0)=(0,0)$, then $f(t)=(0,0)$ for all $t$. To see this by contradiction, suppose that $f(t)$ is not always $(0,0)$.  Removing an initial part of the interval and then rescaling if necessary, assume that $0=\\sup\\{t:f([0,t])=\\{(0,0)\\}\\}$.  By continuity of $f_2$, there is a $\\delta>0$ such that $|f_2(t)|<1$ for all $t<\\delta$.  Take $t_0$ with $0<t_0<\\delta$ and $f_1(t_0)>0$.  By continuity of $f_1$ and the intermediate value theorem, $[0,f_1(t_0)]$ is in the image of $f_1$ restricted to $[0,t_0]$.  Since $f_2(t)=\\sin(1/f_1(t))$ for all $t$ with $f_1(t)\\neq0$ and $\\sin(1/x)$ maps $]0,\\varepsilon[$ onto $[-1,1]$ for all $\\varepsilon>0$, it follows that $[-1,1]$ is in the image of $f_2$ restricted to $[0,t_0]$.  This contradicts $t_0<\\delta$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me start by reading the original question carefully.\n\nThe title is \"Topologist's sine curve is not path-connected\". The question asks for a preferably elementary proof that the graph of the function y(x) defined on [0,1) with y(x) = sin(1/x) for 0 < x < 1 and y(0) = 0 is not path-connected.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. Let's parse the problem.\n\nThe function y is defined on the interval [0,1). The domain is [0,1), which is important. The function has two parts: for x between 0 and 1, it's sin(1/x), and at x=0, it's 0. So the graph of this function is the union of the point (0,0) and the curve sin(1/x) from x approaching 0 to x approaching 1.\n\nThe problem is about proving that this graph is not path-connected. Path-connectedness means that for any two points in the space, there's a continuous function from [0,1] to the space connecting them. The Topologist's sine curve is a classic example of a connected space that's not path-connected.\n\nNow, the assumptions here would be:\n\n1. The domain of y is the interval [0,1).\n2. y(x) is defined as sin(1/x) for x in (0,1).\n3. y(0) is defined as 0.\n4. The graph of y is considered as a subspace of ℝ² with the standard topology.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The first three define the function y, and the fourth specifies the topological space in which we're considering the graph. The problem is to prove that this graph is not path-connected.\n\nWait, but in the example given earlier, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7. But in this case, the problem doesn't have additional assumptions beyond the definition of the function. So perhaps all the conditions given in the problem statement are the assumptions here.\n\nLet me check the original problem again. The user wrote: \"the graph of the (discontinuous) function y defined on [0,1) by...\" So the function's definition is part of the problem's setup. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- The function y is defined on the interval [0,1).\n- For 0 < x < 1, y(x) = sin(1/x).\n- At x = 0, y(x) = 0.\n- The problem concerns the graph of this function as a subspace of ℝ².\n\nEach of these points is a separate assumption. The problem is to prove that this graph is not path-connected. \n\nI should list each of these in the Assumption section line by line, each addressing one property or condition. The problem statement is as given: proving the graph is not path-connected. \n\nWait, but the original example had \"assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". So each line is one condition. Here, the function's definition is split into multiple conditions. Let me make sure each is a separate line.\n\nAssumption:\n- The function y is defined on the interval [0,1).\n- For x ∈ (0,1), y(x) = sin(1/x).\n- y(0) = 0.\n- The graph of y is considered with the subspace topology inherited from ℝ².\n\nProblem: Prove that the graph of y is not path-connected.\n\nThat seems to fit. Each line is a separate assumption about the function or the space. The problem is to prove the lack of path-connectedness.",
