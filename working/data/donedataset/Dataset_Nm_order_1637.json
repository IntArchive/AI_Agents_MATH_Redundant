    "Content": "Question: Show that $$\\int\\limits_0^{\\infty}\\frac {\\arctan x\\log(1+x^2)}{x(1+x^2)}dx=\\frac {\\pi}2\\log^22.$$ I can't tell if I'm being an idiot, or if this is a lot more difficult than it looks. First, I tried integration by parts using the fact that $$\\frac 1{x(1+x^2)}=\\frac 1x-\\frac x{1+x^2}.$$ But quickly I gave up as I wasn't sure what to do with the result.

Should I use integration by parts? Differentiation under the integral sign? I'm having trouble getting started with this integral. Any ideas?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "We can use differentiation under the integral sign and a trick to evaluate this.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this integral problem. The user wants to show that the integral from 0 to infinity of [arctan(x) * log(1+x²)] divided by [x(1+x²)] dx equals (π/2) times (log 2) squared. Hmm, that looks complicated, but maybe there's a clever substitution or some symmetry to exploit.\n\nFirst, let me parse the problem. The integral is ∫₀^∞ [arctan(x) * log(1+x²)] / [x(1+x²)] dx. They mentioned trying integration by parts and substitution t = arctan(x). Let me see. If we let t = arctan(x), then x = tan(t), dx = sec²(t) dt. The limits would go from 0 to π/2. Let's substitute:\n\nThe numerator becomes t * log(1 + tan²(t)). But 1 + tan²(t) is sec²(t), so log(sec²(t)) which is 2 log(sec t) = -2 log(cos t). So the integral becomes ∫₀^(π/2) [t * (-2 log cos t)] / [tan(t) * (1 + tan²(t))] * sec²(t) dt.\n\nWait, let me compute the denominator. The original denominator is x(1+x²). Substituting x = tan(t), denominator is tan(t)*(1 + tan²(t)) = tan(t)*sec²(t). Then, dx is sec²(t) dt. So putting it all together:\n\nIntegral becomes [t * (-2 log cos t)] / [tan(t) * sec²(t)] * sec²(t) dt. The sec²(t) in the denominator cancels with the dx's sec²(t), leaving us with [ -2 t log cos t ] / tan(t) dt. But tan(t) is sin(t)/cos(t), so dividing by tan(t) is multiplying by cos(t)/sin(t). Therefore, the integral simplifies to -2 ∫₀^(π/2) t * log cos t * (cos t / sin t) dt = -2 ∫₀^(π/2) t cot t log cos t dt. That's what the user got, which matches their transformed integral.\n\nSo now the problem is to compute -2 ∫₀^(π/2) t cot t log cos t dt. The user is stuck here. Let's think about possible approaches. Integration by parts? Let me consider u = t cot t and dv = log cos t dt. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe switch the order of integration or use series expansion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider expanding log cos t into a Fourier series or use known integrals. Wait, I recall that log cos t can be expressed as -Σ ( (-1)^k (2^{2k} - 1) ζ(2k) / (k π^{2k}) ) t^{2k} ) or something, but that might not be helpful. Alternatively, maybe use substitution u = π/2 - t, but not sure.\n\nWait, another thought: differentiation under the integral sign. Let me consider introducing a parameter. Suppose we let I(a) = ∫₀^(π/2) t cot t log cos(a t) dt. Then differentiate with respect to a? But that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe relate this integral to known integrals involving cot t and log cos t.\n\nAlternatively, let's try integration by parts. Let me set u = t cot t log cos t, but that seems messy. Wait, let's split the integrand into t cot t and log cos t. Let me let u = log cos t, dv = t cot t dt. Then du = - tan t dt, and we need to find v such that dv = t cot t dt. Hmm, integrating t cot t dt. Hmm, integrating t cot t. Let's consider integrating t cot t. Integration by parts: let’s set w = t, dz = cot t dt. Then dw = dt, z = log sin t. So ∫ t cot t dt = t log sin t - ∫ log sin t dt. But ∫ log sin t dt from 0 to π/2 is known, it's (-π/2) log 2. Wait, but this seems like it might lead somewhere.\n\nWait, let me try integrating by parts the original transformed integral: -2 ∫₀^(π/2) t cot t log cos t dt. Let’s set u = t, dv = cot t log cos t dt. Then du = dt, and v = ∫ cot t log cos t dt. Let me compute v. Let’s make substitution y = cos t. Then dy = -sin t dt. cot t = cos t / sin t, so cot t dt = dy / (-y). So ∫ cot t log cos t dt = ∫ (log y) * (dy / (-y)) = - ∫ (log y)/y dy = - ( (log y)^2 / 2 ) + C = - (log cos t)^2 / 2 + C. So v = - (log cos t)^2 / 2. Therefore, integration by parts gives uv|₀^(π/2) - ∫₀^(π/2) v du = [ t * (- (log cos t)^2 / 2 ) ] from 0 to π/2 + (1/2) ∫₀^(π/2) (log cos t)^2 dt.\n\nNow, evaluating the boundary term: as t approaches π/2, cos t approaches 0, so log cos t approaches -infty, but multiplied by t which approaches π/2. So t*(log cos t)^2: let's check the limit. As t→π/2, let’s set t = π/2 - ε. Then cos t ≈ ε, log cos t ≈ log ε. Then (log ε)^2 multiplied by (π/2 - ε) → (π/2)(log ε)^2, which tends to infinity times (-infty)^2, which is infinity. But multiplied by the negative sign in front, it would be -infinity. However, we need to check the actual limit. Wait, but the original integral is finite, so maybe the boundary terms cancel? Wait, when t approaches 0, log cos t ≈ log(1 - t²/2) ≈ -t²/2, so (log cos t)^2 ≈ t^4 /4, multiplied by t gives t^5/4, which tends to 0. At t=π/2, the term is problematic. Wait, but maybe the integral by parts isn't valid because the boundary term diverges? That complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this approach isn't the right way. Let's think differently. Let's consider that the integral involves t cot t log cos t. Maybe expand log cos t into a series. Recall that log cos t = -Σ_{k=1}^∞ ( (-1)^k (2^{2k} - 1) B_{2k} / (k (2k)!)) ) t^{2k} }, but that might be messy. Alternatively, use the expansion log cos t = -Σ_{n=1}^∞ ( (-1)^n (2^{2n} - 1) ζ(2n) / (n π^{2n}) ) t^{2n} }, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, use Fourier series: log cos t = -Σ_{k=1}^∞ ( (-1)^k (2^{2k} - 1) B_{2k} / (k (2k)!)) ) t^{2k} }, but integrating term by term.\n\nAlternatively, switch variables. Let me consider substituting u = sin t. Let’s try u = sin t, then du = cos t dt. But cot t = cos t / sin t = sqrt(1 - u²)/u. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, another thought. Let's recall that ∫₀^(π/2) t cot t dt can be related to known integrals. Maybe split the integrand into t cot t log cos t. Alternatively, consider differentiating with respect to a parameter. Let's set I(a) = ∫₀^(π/2) t cot t log cos(a t) dt. Then compute I'(a) = ∫₀^(π/2) t cot t * (-t tan(a t)) dt. Wait, but differentiating log cos(a t) gives -t tan(a t). Not sure if this helps.\n\nAlternatively, consider the integral ∫₀^(π/2} t cot t log cos t dt. Let me write cot t as (cos t)/sin t. Then the integrand becomes t (cos t / sin t) log cos t. Let me substitute u = cos t. Then du = -sin t dt. When t=0, u=1; t=π/2, u=0. Then, sin t = sqrt(1 - u²). So the integral becomes ∫₁^0 t (u / sqrt(1 - u²)) log u * (-du / sqrt(1 - u²)) ). Wait, t here is arccos u. So substituting t = arccos u, dt = -du / sqrt(1 - u²). Hmm, let's see:\n\nOriginal integral after substitution:\n\nIntegral becomes ∫₁^0 [ arccos u * (u / sqrt(1 - u²)) * log u ] * (-du / sqrt(1 - u²)) )\n\nSimplify the terms:\n\nThe two sqrt(1 - u²) in the denominator multiply to (1 - u²), so the integrand becomes arccos u * u log u / (1 - u²) du. So the integral is ∫₀¹ [ arccos u * u log u ] / (1 - u²) du. Not sure if this is better. Maybe another substitution here. Let me set v = arccos u. Then u = cos v, du = -sin v dv. When u=0, v=π/2; u=1, v=0. So the integral becomes ∫_{π/2}^0 [ v * cos v * log cos v ] / (1 - cos² v) * (-sin v dv) ) = ∫₀^{π/2} [ v cos v log cos v / sin² v ] sin v dv = ∫₀^{π/2} v cos v log cos v / sin v dv. Which brings us back to a similar integral. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider expanding log cos t as a series. From the Taylor series, log cos t = -Σ_{n=1}^∞ ( (2^{2n} - 1) |B_{2n}| ) / (2n (2n)!) ) t^{2n} }, where B_{2n} are Bernoulli numbers. Then, the integral becomes -2 ∫₀^{π/2} t cot t Σ_{n=1}^∞ [ (2^{2n} - 1) |B_{2n}| / (2n (2n)!)) ] t^{2n} dt. Then, interchange sum and integral: -2 Σ_{n=1}^∞ [ (2^{2n} - 1) |B_{2n}| / (2n (2n)!)) ] ∫₀^{π/2} t^{2n +1} cot t dt. Hmm, but integrating t^{2n +1} cot t is still not straightforward. Maybe there's a recursive formula or known integral for ∫ t^k cot t dt.\n\nAlternatively, recall that cot t = i (1 + e^{-2 i t}) / (1 - e^{-2 i t}) ), but complex analysis might be too involved here.\n\nWait, maybe consider expanding cot t as a series. We know that cot t = 1/t - 2 Σ_{k=1}^∞ ( ζ(2k) / π^{2k} ) t^{2k -1} ), but again, integrating term by term might be possible.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the integral ∫₀^{π/2} t cot t log cos t dt. Let me write cot t as 1/t - t/3 - t^3/45 - ... but not sure. Alternatively, use the expansion cot t = Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n 2^{2n} B_{2n} t^{2n -1} / (2n)! ) for |t| < π. So cot t = 1/t - t/3 - t^3/45 - 2t^5/945 - ... So then t cot t = 1 - t²/3 - t^4/45 - 2t^6/945 - ... So substituting into the integral: ∫₀^{π/2} [1 - t²/3 - t^4/45 - ... ] log cos t dt. So expanding, the integral becomes ∫₀^{π/2} log cos t dt - (1/3) ∫₀^{π/2} t² log cos t dt - (1/45) ∫₀^{π/2} t^4 log cos t dt - ... \n\nWe know that ∫₀^{π/2} log cos t dt = - (π/2) log 2. The integral ∫₀^{π/2} t² log cos t dt can be computed via known results. Similarly, integrals of t^{2n} log cos t dt can be expressed in terms of derivatives of the zeta function or other special functions. However, this approach seems to lead to an infinite series which might sum up to the desired result. But this might be complicated. Let me check if there's a smarter way.\n\nWait, the original integral after substitution is -2 ∫₀^{π/2} t cot t log cos t dt. Let me denote this as -2 I. So we need to compute I = ∫₀^{π/2} t cot t log cos t dt. Let me consider integrating by parts again, but this time with different choices. Let’s set u = log cos t and dv = t cot t dt. Then du = - tan t dt, and dv = t cot t dt. Wait, integrating dv = t cot t dt. Let’s try integrating t cot t. As before, integrate by parts: let w = t, dz = cot t dt. Then dw = dt, z = log sin t. So ∫ t cot t dt = t log sin t - ∫ log sin t dt. So, ∫ t cot t dt = t log sin t - ∫ log sin t dt. Therefore, v = t log sin t - ∫ log sin t dt. So back to integration by parts: I = u v |₀^{π/2} - ∫₀^{π/2} v du. Where u = log cos t, dv = t cot t dt.\n\nSo I = [ log cos t * ( t log sin t - ∫ log sin t dt ) ] from 0 to π/2 - ∫₀^{π/2} ( t log sin t - ∫ log sin t dt ) * (- tan t) dt.\n\nThis seems too convoluted. Maybe another approach. Let me recall that log(1+x²) in the original integral. Perhaps consider substituting x = tan t, which they did, but maybe another substitution. Alternatively, maybe express the original integral as a double integral and interchange the order. Let me see. The original integral is ∫₀^∞ [ arctan x * log(1 + x²) ] / [ x (1 + x²) ] dx. Let me recall that arctan x = ∫₀^x dt / (1 + t²). So perhaps express arctan x as an integral and interchange. Let’s try:\n\nA(n) = ∫₀^∞ [ (∫₀^x dt/(1 + t²)) * log(1 + x²) ] / [ x (1 + x²) ] dx. Switch the order of integration. The region is t from 0 to x, x from 0 to ∞. So changing variables to t and x where t ≤ x. So integral becomes ∫₀^∞ ∫ₜ^∞ [ log(1 + x²) / ( x (1 + x²) (1 + t²) ) ] dx dt. Not sure if this helps. Let me compute the inner integral: ∫ₜ^∞ log(1 + x²) / [ x (1 + x²) ] dx. Let me substitute y = x². Then dy = 2x dx. So x dx = dy/2. The integral becomes ∫_{t²}^∞ log(1 + y) / [ (sqrt(y)) (1 + y) ) ] * (dy/(2 sqrt(y)) )) = (1/2) ∫_{t²}^∞ log(1 + y) / [ y (1 + y) ] dy. Hmm, this simplifies to (1/2) ∫_{t²}^∞ [ log(1 + y) / y - log(1 + y)/(1 + y) ] dy. Integrating term by term: ∫ log(1 + y)/y dy is a dilogarithm function, and ∫ log(1 + y)/(1 + y) dy is (1/2)(log(1 + y))². But this seems complicated. Maybe not the right path.\n\nAlternatively, use symmetry or substitution. Let me consider substituting x = 1/t in the original integral. Let x = 1/t, then dx = - dt / t². The integral becomes ∫∞^0 [ arctan(1/t) * log(1 + 1/t²) ] / [ (1/t) (1 + 1/t²) ] * (- dt/t² ). Simplify. arctan(1/t) = π/2 - arctan t for t > 0. log(1 + 1/t²) = log( (t² + 1)/t² ) = log(1 + t²) - 2 log t. The denominator: (1/t)(1 + 1/t²) = (1/t)( (t² + 1)/t² ) = (t² + 1)/t³. So putting it all together:\n\nIntegral becomes ∫₀^∞ [ (π/2 - arctan t)(log(1 + t²) - 2 log t) ] / ( (t² + 1)/t³ ) * (dt/t²) )\n\nSimplify the denominator and dt term: dividing by (t² +1)/t³ and multiplying by dt/t² gives (t³ / (t² +1)) * (dt/t²) = t dt / (t² +1). So the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ [ (π/2 - arctan t)(log(1 + t²) - 2 log t) ] * t / (t² +1) dt.\n\nThis looks similar to the original integral but with transformed terms. Let me denote the original integral as I. Then, after substitution, we have I = ∫₀^∞ [ (π/2 - arctan t)(log(1 + t²) - 2 log t) ] * t / (t² +1) dt. Expand the terms:\n\nI = ∫₀^∞ [ (π/2)(log(1 + t²) - 2 log t) - arctan t (log(1 + t²) - 2 log t) ] * t / (t² +1) dt.\n\nThis can be split into two integrals:\n\nI = (π/2) ∫₀^∞ [ log(1 + t²) - 2 log t ] * t / (t² +1) dt - ∫₀^∞ [ arctan t (log(1 + t²) - 2 log t) ] * t / (t² +1) dt.\n\nNotice that the second integral is similar to the original integral I. Let's denote the second integral as J. So:\n\nI = (π/2) [ ∫₀^∞ log(1 + t²) * t / (t² +1) dt - 2 ∫₀^∞ log t * t / (t² +1) dt ] - J.\n\nBut J is ∫₀^∞ [ arctan t (log(1 + t²) - 2 log t ) ] * t / (t² +1) dt. However, this seems like it's expressing I in terms of J and other integrals. But I'm not sure if this helps directly. Let me compute the other integrals.\n\nFirst, compute ∫₀^∞ log(1 + t²) * t / (t² +1) dt. Let me substitute u = t². Then du = 2t dt, so t dt = du/2. The integral becomes ∫₀^∞ log(1 + u) / (1 + u) * (du/2) = (1/2) ∫₀^∞ log(1 + u)/(1 + u) du. Let v = 1 + u, dv = du. Then integral becomes (1/2) ∫₁^∞ log v / v dv = (1/2) ∫₁^∞ (log v) v^{-1} dv. The integral of log v / v dv is (log v)^2 / 2. So evaluating from 1 to ∞: as v approaches ∞, (log v)^2 / 2 approaches infinity. Wait, this diverges. But that can't be, because the original integral should converge. Wait, what's wrong here?\n\nWait, original integral after substitution is ∫₀^∞ log(1 + t²) * t / (t² +1) dt. Let me check convergence. As t approaches ∞, log(1 + t²) ~ 2 log t, and the integrand behaves like 2 log t * t / t² = 2 log t / t, which integrates to 2 (log t)^2 / 2, which diverges. So this integral diverges. But that's a problem. However, the original substitution led to an expression involving this divergent integral. But the original integral I is convergent. That suggests that maybe this approach has a mistake, or the divergent terms cancel out.\n\nHmm, this seems like a dead end. Let me think differently. Going back to the transformed integral: -2 ∫₀^{π/2} t cot t log cos t dt. Let me consider integrating by parts with u = log cos t, dv = -2 t cot t dt. Wait, but earlier attempt showed issues with boundary terms. Perhaps consider another substitution. Let me set y = sin t. Then dy = cos t dt. Then cot t = cos t / sin t = sqrt(1 - y²)/y. The integral becomes -2 ∫₀^1 (arcsin y) * (sqrt(1 - y²)/y) * log sqrt(1 - y²) * ( dy / sqrt(1 - y²) ) ). Simplify: sqrt(1 - y²) cancels, leaving -2 ∫₀^1 (arcsin y / y) * (1/2) log(1 - y²) dy = - ∫₀^1 (arcsin y / y) log(1 - y²) dy.\n\nHmm, maybe expanding arcsin y and log(1 - y²) into power series. Recall that arcsin y = Σ_{k=0}^∞ ( (2k)! / (4^k (k!)^2 (2k + 1)) ) ) y^{2k +1} }, and log(1 - y²) = -Σ_{m=1}^∞ y^{2m}/m. Then multiply the series:\n\n- ∫₀^1 [ Σ_{k=0}^∞ ( (2k)! / (4^k (k!)^2 (2k + 1)) ) y^{2k +1} / y ) * Σ_{m=1}^∞ y^{2m}/m ] dy = - ∫₀^1 [ Σ_{k=0}^∞ ( (2k)! / (4^k (k!)^2 (2k + 1)) ) y^{2k} ) * Σ_{m=1}^∞ y^{2m}/m ] dy.\n\nThis becomes - Σ_{k=0}^∞ Σ_{m=1}^∞ [ (2k)! / (4^k (k!)^2 (2k + 1) m) ) ] ∫₀^1 y^{2k + 2m} dy. The integral of y^{2(k + m)} dy from 0 to 1 is 1/(2(k + m) +1). So the expression becomes - Σ_{k=0}^∞ Σ_{m=1}^∞ [ (2k)! / (4^k (k!)^2 (2k + 1) m (2(k + m) +1) ) ) ].\n\nThis double series looks very complicated, but maybe there's a way to sum it. However, this seems quite involved and not straightforward. I'm not sure if this approach will lead to the desired result of (π/2)(log 2)^2.\n\nPerhaps another strategy: known integrals involving log cos t and t cot t. Let me search my memory for such integrals. Wait, I recall that ∫₀^{π/2} t cot t dt can be expressed in terms of known constants. Let me compute that. Let’s try integrating t cot t dt by parts. Let u = t, dv = cot t dt. Then du = dt, v = log sin t. So integral = t log sin t |₀^{π/2} - ∫₀^{π/2} log sin t dt. At π/2, sin t = 1, so log 1 = 0. At 0, t log sin t approaches 0 * (-infty), which is 0. So the integral is - ∫₀^{π/2} log sin t dt. We know ∫₀^{π/2} log sin t dt = - (π/2) log 2. So the integral becomes (π/2) log 2. So ∫₀^{π/2} t cot t dt = (π/2) log 2.\n\nBut our integral is ∫₀^{π/2} t cot t log cos t dt. Hmm, perhaps differentiating under the integral sign. Let’s consider I(a) = ∫₀^{π/2} t cot t log cos(a t) dt. Then I’(a) = ∫₀^{π/2} t cot t * (-t sin(a t)/cos(a t)) dt = - ∫₀^{π/2} t² cot t tan(a t) dt. Not sure if helpful. At a=1, it's our integral. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's try substituting t = π/2 - u. Then when t=0, u=π/2; t=π/2, u=0. The integral becomes ∫₀^{π/2} (π/2 - u) cot(π/2 - u) log cos(π/2 - u) du. But cot(π/2 - u) = tan u, and log cos(π/2 - u) = log sin u. So the integral becomes ∫₀^{π/2} (π/2 - u) tan u log sin u du. Which is similar to the original integral but with tan u and log sin u. Not sure if this helps, but maybe adding this integral to the original one.\n\nLet’s denote I = ∫₀^{π/2} t cot t log cos t dt, and the transformed integral is ∫₀^{π/2} (π/2 - u) tan u log sin u du. Let’s denote this as J. Then I + J = ∫₀^{π/2} [ t cot t log cos t + (π/2 - t) tan t log sin t ] dt. Maybe this simplifies. Let's look at the integrand:\n\nt cot t log cos t + (π/2 - t) tan t log sin t.\n\nExpress cot t = cos t / sin t and tan t = sin t / cos t:\n\nt (cos t / sin t) log cos t + (π/2 - t) (sin t / cos t) log sin t.\n\nMultiply through:\n\nt cos t log cos t / sin t + (π/2 - t) sin t log sin t / cos t.\n\nThis doesn’t immediately seem to simplify. Perhaps not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: express the integral in terms of the beta function or gamma function. Alternatively, consider Fourier series expansions. For example, log cos t can be expanded as -Σ_{k=1}^\\infty (-1)^k (2^{2k} - 1) B_{2k} t^{2k} / (k (2k)!)) ), but integrating term by term might not converge.\n\nAlternatively, consider differentiating the integral I with respect to a parameter. Let me assume that the integral can be expressed as a function involving log^2 2 and pi. Since the answer is (π/2)(log 2)^2, perhaps there's a way to relate this integral to squaring the integral of log cos t or something similar.\n\nWait, recall that ∫₀^{π/2} log cos t dt = - (π/2) log 2. Similarly, ∫₀^{π/2} log sin t dt = - (π/2) log 2. Also, ∫₀^{π/2} log tan t dt = 0. Now, the integral we have is involving t cot t log cos t. Let me see if integrating over t relates to these known integrals.\n\nAlternatively, consider writing cot t as d/dt (log sin t). Then, the integral becomes ∫₀^{π/2} t (d/dt log sin t) log cos t dt. Integration by parts: let u = t log cos t, dv = d/dt (log sin t) dt. Then du = log cos t dt - t tan t dt, and v = log sin t. So the integral becomes uv |₀^{π/2} - ∫₀^{π/2} v du = [ t log cos t log sin t ]₀^{π/2} - ∫₀^{π/2} log sin t (log cos t - t tan t) dt.\n\nEvaluate the boundary term: at t=π/2, log cos t approaches -infty, but multiplied by log sin t which approaches log 1 = 0. So the term is 0. At t=0, log cos t approaches 0, and t approaches 0, so the product is 0. Thus, the integral becomes - ∫₀^{π/2} log sin t log cos t dt + ∫₀^{π/2} t tan t log sin t dt.\n\nSo, original integral I = - ∫₀^{π/2} log sin t log cos t dt + ∫₀^{π/2} t tan t log sin t dt.\n\nBut we have another integral involving t tan t log sin t. Let me denote this as K = ∫₀^{π/2} t tan t log sin t dt. If we can relate K to I, maybe we can solve for I.\n\nFrom earlier substitution, we had J = ∫₀^{π/2} (π/2 - t) tan t log sin t dt. But J = ∫₀^{π/2} (π/2 - t) tan t log sin t dt = (π/2) ∫₀^{π/2} tan t log sin t dt - K. Let’s denote L = ∫₀^{π/2} tan t log sin t dt. Then J = (π/2) L - K.\n\nBut we need to express these integrals in terms of known quantities. Let’s compute L = ∫ tan t log sin t dt. Let’s substitute u = sin t, du = cos t dt. Then tan t = u / sqrt(1 - u²), but this might not help. Alternatively, integrate by parts. Let u = log sin t, dv = tan t dt = sin t / cos t dt. Then du = cot t dt, and v = -log cos t. So L = - log sin t log cos t |₀^{π/2} + ∫₀^{π/2} log cos t cot t dt.\n\nThe boundary term: at π/2, log sin t = 0, log cos t = -infty, but product is 0. At 0, log sin t approaches -infty, log cos t approaches 0, so product is 0. Thus, L = ∫₀^{π/2} log cos t cot t dt = I. So L = I.\n\nTherefore, J = (π/2) I - K.\n\nBut recall from earlier, I = - ∫₀^{π/2} log sin t log cos t dt + K. Let me denote M = ∫₀^{π/2} log sin t log cos t dt.\n\nSo I = -M + K. Also, from J = (π/2) I - K and J = ∫₀^{π/2} (π/2 - t) tan t log sin t dt. But I'm getting lost here. Maybe we need another equation relating these integrals.\n\nAlternatively, notice that M can be computed. Let me consider M = ∫₀^{π/2} log sin t log cos t dt. Let’s make substitution u = π/2 - t. Then M = ∫₀^{π/2} log cos u log sin u du = same as original, so M is symmetric. Maybe expand both logs into series. Recall that log sin t = -log 2 - Σ_{k=1}^∞ cos(2kt)/k, and log cos t = -log 2 - Σ_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^k cos(2kt)/k. Multiplying these series gives terms involving cos(2kt) cos(2mt), which can be expressed as sum of cos(2(k+m)t) and cos(2(k-m)t). Integrating over t from 0 to π/2 would pick out terms where k = m, leading to a delta function. This approach might work.\n\nExpand log sin t and log cos t into their Fourier series:\n\nlog sin t = -log 2 - Σ_{n=1}^∞ ( cos(2nt) ) / n, valid for 0 < t < π.\n\nSimilarly, log cos t = -log 2 - Σ_{m=1}^∞ ( (-1)^m cos(2mt) ) / m, valid for |t| < π/2.\n\nThus, the product is:\n\n(log sin t)(log cos t) = [ -log 2 - Σ_{n=1}^∞ cos(2nt)/n ] [ -log 2 - Σ_{m=1}^∞ (-1)^m cos(2mt)/m ].\n\nMultiply out the terms:\n\n= (log 2)^2 + log 2 Σ_{m=1}^∞ (-1)^m cos(2mt)/m + log 2 Σ_{n=1}^∞ cos(2nt)/n + Σ_{n=1}^∞ Σ_{m=1}^∞ [ cos(2nt) cos(2mt) / (n m) ) (-1)^m ].\n\nIntegrate over t from 0 to π/2:\n\nM = ∫₀^{π/2} (log sin t)(log cos t) dt = (log 2)^2 (π/2) + log 2 Σ_{m=1}^∞ (-1)^m/m ∫₀^{π/2} cos(2mt) dt + log 2 Σ_{n=1}^∞ 1/n ∫₀^{π/2} cos(2nt) dt + Σ_{n=1}^∞ Σ_{m=1}^∞ [ (-1)^m / (n m) ) ∫₀^{π/2} cos(2nt) cos(2mt) dt ].\n\nCompute each integral:\n\nFirst term: (log 2)^2 (π/2).\n\nSecond and third terms: log 2 times Σ_{m=1}^∞ (-1)^m/m [ (sin(2mt)/2m) from 0 to π/2 ] = log 2 Σ_{m=1}^∞ (-1)^m/m [ sin(mπ)/2m - sin 0 ] = 0, since sin(mπ) = 0 for integer m.\n\nSimilarly, the third term is log 2 Σ_{n=1}^∞ 1/n [ sin(2n t)/2n ] from 0 to π/2 = log 2 Σ_{n=1}^∞ 1/n [ sin(nπ)/2n - 0 ] = 0.\n\nFourth term: Σ_{n,m} [ (-1)^m / (n m) ) ∫₀^{π/2} cos(2nt) cos(2mt) dt ].\n\nUse identity: cos A cos B = [ cos(A+B) + cos(A-B) ] / 2. So the integral becomes:\n\n1/2 ∫₀^{π/2} [ cos(2(n+m)t) + cos(2(n - m)t) ] dt.\n\nIntegral of cos(2kt) from 0 to π/2 is [ sin(2kπ/2) / 2k ] - 0 = sin(kπ)/2k = 0 for integer k. Unless k=0, but here k = n + m and |n - m|, both positive integers. Thus, the integral is 0 except when n = m. Wait, when n = m, then the second term becomes cos(0) = 1, so integral becomes 1/2 ∫₀^{π/2} [ cos(4nt) + 1 ] dt = 1/2 [ (sin(4nπ/2)/4n ) + π/2 ] = 1/2 [ (sin(2nπ)/4n ) + π/2 ] = 1/2 (0 + π/2) = π/4.\n\nSo, when n = m, the integral is π/4. Otherwise, it's zero. Therefore, the double sum reduces to Σ_{n=1}^∞ [ (-1)^n / (n^2) ) * π/4 ].\n\nThus, the fourth term is Σ_{n=1}^∞ [ (-1)^n / (n^2) ) * π/4 ] = (π/4) Σ_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^n / n^2.\n\nWe know that Σ_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^n / n^2 = -η(2) = - (π^2)/12, where η is the Dirichlet eta function. Since η(2) = (1 - 2^{1 - 2}) ζ(2) = (1 - 1/2) π^2/6 = π^2/12. Hence, Σ_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^n / n^2 = - π^2 /12.\n\nThus, the fourth term is (π/4)( - π^2 /12 ) = - π^3 /48.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nM = (π/2)(log 2)^2 + 0 + 0 - π^3 /48.\n\nBut wait, this contradicts the expected result. Also, M should be a real number, but according to this, it's (π/2)(log 2)^2 - π^3 /48. However, the original integral we're trying to compute is supposed to be (π/2)(log 2)^2. So this suggests that perhaps there's a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me recheck the fourth term. When n = m, the integral becomes ∫₀^{π/2} [ cos(4nt) + 1 ] /2 dt. The integral of cos(4nt) from 0 to π/2 is [ sin(4nπ/2)/4n ] - 0 = sin(2nπ)/4n = 0. Thus, integral becomes 1/2 ∫₀^{π/2} 1 dt = 1/2 * π/2 = π/4. So the fourth term is Σ_{n=1}^∞ [ (-1)^n / (n^2) ) * π/4 ].\n\nBut that summation is (π/4) Σ_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^n /n² = (π/4)( - η(2) ) = (π/4)( - (1 - 2^{1 - 2}) ζ(2) ) = (π/4)( - (1 - 1/2) π²/6 ) = (π/4)( - π²/12 ) = - π³/48.\n\nThus, M = (π/2)(log 2)^2 - π³/48.\n\nBut how does this relate to our original problem? Recall that I = -M + K, and we need to find I. But we also have J = (π/2) I - K. But J was defined as ∫₀^{π/2} (π/2 - t) tan t log sin t dt. However, this seems to lead us into a system of equations.\n\nLet me recall from earlier:\n\nI = ∫₀^{π/2} t cot t log cos t dt = -M + K.\n\nK = ∫₀^{π/2} t tan t log sin t dt.\n\nJ = ∫₀^{π/2} (π/2 - t) tan t log sin t dt = (π/2) L - K, where L = I.\n\nBut L = ∫₀^{π/2} tan t log sin t dt = I.\n\nWait, no. Earlier, we set L = ∫ tan t log sin t dt and found L = I.\n\nWait, no: earlier, L was defined as ∫₀^{π/2} tan t log sin t dt. Then, integrating by parts, we found L = I. So L = I.\n\nThus, J = (π/2) I - K.\n\nBut also, J is the transformed integral when substituting t = π/2 - u, which gives J = ∫₀^{π/2} (π/2 - t) tan t log sin t dt. But we already have J = (π/2) I - K.\n\nBut also, from the earlier expression when we substituted x = 1/t in the original integral, we obtained an equation involving I and J. But that path led to divergent integrals, so perhaps not useful.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the original integral is expressed as I = -M + K, and we need another equation relating K and I.\n\nFrom J = (π/2) I - K, and J is also ∫₀^{π/2} (π/2 - t) tan t log sin t dt. Let me compute J directly. Maybe integrating by parts.\n\nLet’s set in J: u = (π/2 - t), dv = tan t log sin t dt. Then du = -dt, and we need to find v = ∫ tan t log sin t dt. Let’s compute v:\n\nv = ∫ tan t log sin t dt = ∫ (sin t / cos t) log sin t dt. Let’s substitute y = cos t, dy = -sin t dt. Then:\n\nv = - ∫ (log sqrt(1 - y²)) / y * dy. Wait, log sin t = log sqrt(1 - cos² t) = (1/2) log(1 - y²). So v = - (1/2) ∫ log(1 - y²)/y dy.\n\nThis integral is - (1/2) ∫ [ log(1 - y) + log(1 + y) ] / y dy = - (1/2) [ ∫ log(1 - y)/y dy + ∫ log(1 + y)/y dy ].\n\nThese integrals are dilogarithms: ∫ log(1 - y)/y dy = - Li_2(y) + C, and ∫ log(1 + y)/y dy = - Li_2(-y) + C. Therefore, v = - (1/2) [ - Li_2(y) - Li_2(-y) ] + C = (1/2)( Li_2(y) + Li_2(-y) ) + C. Substituting back y = cos t:\n\nv = (1/2)( Li_2(cos t) + Li_2(-cos t) ) + C.\n\nThus, J = u v |₀^{π/2} - ∫₀^{π/2} v (-dt) = [ (π/2 - t) v ]₀^{π/2} + ∫₀^{π/2} v dt.\n\nAt t=π/2, y=cos t=0, so Li_2(0) + Li_2(0) = 0 + 0 = 0. Thus, the term is 0. At t=0, (π/2 - t) = π/2, and y=cos t=1. Li_2(1) = π²/6, Li_2(-1) = -π²/12. So Li_2(1) + Li_2(-1) = π²/6 - π²/12 = π²/12. Thus, the boundary term is π/2 * (1/2)(π²/12) = π³/(48).\n\nThen, J = π³/48 + ∫₀^{π/2} v dt. But ∫₀^{π/2} v dt = (1/2) ∫₀^{π/2} [ Li_2(cos t) + Li_2(-cos t) ] dt. This seems very complicated and likely not expressible in elementary terms.\n\nThis approach seems to be hitting a wall. Let's recap. We need to compute I = ∫₀^{π/2} t cot t log cos t dt. We have expressed I in terms of M and K, and related K and I through other integrals, but these relations involve unknown quantities. However, we computed M = (π/2)(log 2)^2 - π³/48.\n\nIf we assume that the final answer is (π/2)(log 2)^2, then perhaps there's a cancellation that leads to this result. Given that the original integral is equal to -2I, and the desired result is (π/2)(log 2)^2, then -2I = π/2 (log 2)^2, so I = -π/4 (log 2)^2.\n\nBut from our earlier expression, I = -M + K. If I = -π/4 (log 2)^2, then -π/4 (log 2)^2 = -M + K. We have M = (π/2)(log 2)^2 - π³/48. Thus:\n\n-π/4 (log 2)^2 = - [ (π/2)(log 2)^2 - π³/48 ] + K\n\n=> -π/4 (log 2)^2 = -π/2 (log 2)^2 + π³/48 + K\n\n=> K = π/4 (log 2)^2 - π³/48\n\nBut K is ∫₀^{π/2} t tan t log sin t dt, which we don't have a value for. This suggests that we need to find another way.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of progress, perhaps I should recall that this integral is known and the result is indeed (π/2)(log 2)^2. Therefore, the original integral evaluates to this result. The key steps involve substitutions and possibly using Fourier series or recognizing the integral as a known form. Given the complexity, it's possible that this problem requires advanced techniques or insights that I'm not recalling at the moment. However, based on the problem statement and the expected answer, the assumptions and problem structure would be as follows.",
