    "Content": "I'm trying to understand this example in Hartshorne's algebraic geometry book In order to prove the irreducible part, suppose $Y$ is an irreducible space and $Y'$ a open subset of $Y$ with $Y'=Y'_1\\cup Y'_2$ with $Y'_1,Y'_2$ proper closed subsets. Then $Y=(Y-Y')\\cup (Y'_1\\cup Y'_2)$ contradiction because $Y$ is irreducible. Am I right? I need help also in the density part, I'm really stuck I don't know even how to begin. Thanks a lot.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Your proof for the irreducible part is wrong. For example what do you mean by $Y' = Y_1 \\cup Y_2$ with $Y_1,Y_2$ closed? The key question is closed in which space ? First I would prove that an open subset of an irreducible space is dense: If $U$ open and non-empty is such that $\\overline{U} \\neq Y$ then immediately we can write $Y= U^c \\cup \\overline{U}$ contradicting $Y$ being irreducible. Then now you can use this result to prove that any open subset of an irreducible space is irreducible: If $U = A \\cup B$ with $A,B$ closed in $U$ then taking closures in $Y$ we get that $Y = \\overline{U} = \\overline{A} \\cup \\overline{B}$ and so this forces $\\overline{A} = Y$ say. But now the closure of $A$ in $U$ which is equal to $\\overline{A} \\cap U$ is also equal to $A$ because $A$ was closed in $U$ by assumption. Thus $A = \\overline{A} \\cap U = Y \\cap U = U$. It follows $U$ is irreducible in the subspace topology on it .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the required format. The original question is about proving that an open subset of an irreducible set is dense. \n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions. The user mentions Hartshorne's algebraic geometry book and discusses the irreducible part and the density part. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe problem states that Y is an irreducible space. That's one assumption. Then, Y' is an open subset of Y. So another assumption is that Y' is open in Y. The user's approach involves expressing Y' as a union of two proper closed subsets, leading to a contradiction because Y is irreducible. \n\nWait, the original problem is to prove two parts: that Y' is irreducible and that it's dense. But in the example provided by the user, they are trying to show the irreducible part by contradiction, assuming Y' is a union of two closed subsets. However, the actual problem might be structured differently. Let me check the exact wording again.\n\nThe title is \"An open subset of an irreducible set is dense.\" So the main problem is to prove that an open subset of an irreducible space is dense. The user is also asking about the density part, indicating that the problem has two parts: proving the open subset is irreducible and that it's dense. \n\nBut according to the user's example, the formatted problem should list assumptions and then the problem. The original problem as stated in the title is about density, but the user's question also mentions the irreducible part. So perhaps the problem is twofold: show that an open subset of an irreducible space is irreducible and that it's dense.\n\nWait, no. The title says \"An open subset of an irreducible set is dense,\" which is the main statement. The user's confusion is about both parts: the irreducible part (which might be a lemma to reach the density conclusion) and the density part. However, the problem as presented by the user might be: Prove that an open subset of an irreducible space is dense. But the user's attempt involves showing irreducibility. Maybe the actual problem is to show that an open subset of an irreducible space is itself irreducible and dense. But the title only mentions density. Hmm.\n\nLet me parse the user's question again: \"I'm trying to understand this example in Hartshorne's algebraic geometry book. In order to prove the irreducible part, suppose Y is an irreducible space and Y' a open subset of Y with Y'=Y'_1∪Y'_2 with Y'_1,Y'_2 proper closed subsets. Then Y=(Y-Y')∪ (Y'_1∪Y'_2) contradiction because Y is irreducible. Am I right? I need help also in the density part, I'm really stuck I don't know even how to begin.\"\n\nSo the user is working on an example from Hartshorne where they need to prove two parts: the \"irreducible part\" (that Y' is irreducible) and the \"density part\" (that Y' is dense in Y). The problem in the example is therefore to show both that an open subset of an irreducible space is irreducible and dense. However, typically, in topology, an open subset of an irreducible space is not necessarily irreducible. Wait, but in algebraic geometry, irreducible spaces are often considered with the Zariski topology, where open subsets can be dense. But maybe in Hartshorne's example, under certain conditions, an open subset of an irreducible space is itself irreducible and dense.\n\nBut the user's approach is to suppose Y is irreducible, Y' is open, and then if Y' can be written as a union of two closed subsets, then Y would be a union of Y-Y' and those two, contradicting irreducibility. That seems to be the argument for Y' being irreducible. Then the density part is separate.\n\nBut the problem as stated by the user is not entirely clear. The title mentions density, but the user is also dealing with irreducibility. So perhaps the problem is to prove that if Y is irreducible and Y' is a non-empty open subset, then Y' is irreducible and dense. Therefore, the problem has two parts: proving Y' is irreducible and Y' is dense in Y.\n\nSo for the assumptions, we need:\n\n1. Y is an irreducible topological space.\n2. Y' is an open subset of Y.\n3. Possibly that Y' is non-empty? Because if Y' is empty, it's not dense. But in algebraic geometry contexts, open subsets are often considered non-empty, especially when discussing density.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- Y is an irreducible topological space.\n- Y' is a non-empty open subset of Y.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that Y' is dense in Y and Y' is irreducible.\n\nBut in the user's question, they mention both parts: \"the irreducible part\" and \"the density part.\" So the problem is to prove both.\n\nHowever, in the example given by the user where they structured the problem, the original problem was about divisibility by 91, and the assumptions included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, the problem is from algebraic geometry, so we need to structure it similarly.\n\nThus, the assumptions would be:\n\n- Y is an irreducible topological space.\n- Y' is an open subset of Y.\n\nProblem: Prove that Y' is dense in Y and Y' is irreducible.\n\nWait, but the title only mentions density. The user's question, however, talks about both parts. Maybe the problem in Hartshorne is to show that an open subset of an irreducible space is dense, and the user is trying to use an argument that also involves showing irreducibility. Alternatively, the problem could be to show that a non-empty open subset of an irreducible space is irreducible and dense.\n\nBut in the standard topology, an open subset of an irreducible space is dense if it's non-empty, because irreducible spaces are such that every non-empty open set is dense. Also, in the Zariski topology, irreducible spaces have the property that any non-empty open subset is dense. Moreover, in such spaces, a non-empty open subset of an irreducible space is itself irreducible. So perhaps the problem is to prove both that Y' is irreducible and dense in Y.\n\nTherefore, structuring the problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- Y is an irreducible topological space.\n- Y' is a non-empty open subset of Y.\n\nProblem:\nProve that Y' is dense in Y and Y' is irreducible.\n\nBut the user's original title is \"An open subset of an irreducible set is dense,\" which focuses on density. However, their question mentions both parts. So perhaps the problem as posed in Hartshorne is to show that a non-empty open subset of an irreducible space is dense, and the user is also trying to confirm the irreducibility part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only about density, but the user is confused and also considering irreducibility. But given the user's own attempt, they are trying to handle both parts. Therefore, to structure the problem correctly, I need to see exactly what the problem in Hartshorne is. Since the user refers to \"this example in Hartshorne's algebraic geometry book,\" perhaps the example is demonstrating that an open subset of an irreducible space is dense, and in the process, uses the irreducibility of Y' as a step.\n\nBut without the exact text from Hartshorne, it's a bit tricky. However, based on the user's description, they are trying to prove two parts: the irreducible part and the density part. So the problem is to prove that a non-empty open subset of an irreducible topological space is both dense and irreducible.\n\nHence, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. Y is an irreducible topological space.\n2. Y' is a non-empty open subset of Y.\n\nProblem:\nProve that Y' is dense in Y and Y' is irreducible.\n\nBut in the example provided by the user, the problem was structured with each assumption on a separate line. So perhaps here, the assumptions are:\n\n- Y is an irreducible topological space.\n- Y' is an open subset of Y.\n- Y' is non-empty.\n\nBut maybe non-emptiness is part of the problem's conditions. Alternatively, in algebraic geometry, open subsets are often considered non-empty when discussing density, but to be precise, we should include it.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might not explicitly state that Y' is non-empty, but in the context of density, a subset can't be dense if it's empty (unless the space is empty, which it isn't here since Y is irreducible and thus non-empty). So perhaps the key assumptions are:\n\n- Y is an irreducible topological space.\n- Y' is an open subset of Y.\n\nProblem: Prove that Y' is dense in Y.\n\nBut the user's question also talks about the \"irreducible part,\" suggesting that the problem might also require proving that Y' is irreducible. So maybe the actual problem is to show both that Y' is irreducible and dense. However, typically, the density of Y' follows from Y being irreducible and Y' being non-empty open, but the irreducibility of Y' is a separate statement.\n\nIn summary, based on the user's description, the problem has two parts: proving Y' is irreducible and proving Y' is dense. Therefore, the formatted problem should capture both.\n\nBut let's look at the example again. The original example had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. The problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. Here, the user's problem is about topology, specifically algebraic geometry, with assumptions about Y and Y', leading to the problem of proving density and irreducibility.\n\nSo, structuring the assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\n- Y is an irreducible topological space.\n- Y' is an open subset of Y.\n- Y' is non-empty.\n\nProblem:\nProve that Y' is dense in Y and Y' is irreducible.\n\nHowever, in the user's own attempt, they split the problem into two parts. For the irreducible part, they assume Y' is a union of two closed subsets, leading to a contradiction. For the density part, they are stuck.\n\nTherefore, the problem as presented by the user is to prove both that Y' is irreducible and that Y' is dense. Hence, the formatted problem should include both. However, the title only mentions density, but the user's question includes both parts. Therefore, perhaps the problem in Hartshorne is to prove that an open subset of an irreducible set is dense, and the irreducibility part is a step towards that, or vice versa.\n\nBut to accurately reflect the user's question, which mentions both parts, the problem should include both. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- Y is an irreducible topological space.\n- Y' is a non-empty open subset of Y.\n\nProblem: Prove that Y' is dense in Y and Y' is irreducible.\n\nBut in the example given, the assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property. So here, each assumption is a separate line:\n\nAssumption:\n- Y is an irreducible topological space.\n- Y' is an open subset of Y.\n- Y' is non-empty.\n\nProblem: Prove that Y' is dense in Y and Y' is irreducible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the non-emptiness is implied by being an open subset in an irreducible space (since irreducible spaces are non-empty, and an open subset could be empty or not). But to be precise, Y' must be non-empty to be dense. So including it as an assumption is necessary.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nY is an irreducible topological space,\nY' is an open subset of Y,\nY' is non-empty.\nProblem:\nProve that Y' is dense in Y and Y' is irreducible.",
