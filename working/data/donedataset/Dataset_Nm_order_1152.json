    "Content": "The following problem was posted earlier this year by Cornel Ioan Valean: Prove that $$I=\\int_0^1 \\frac{2x-1}{1+x-x^2}\\left(4\\ln x\\ln(1+x)-\\ln^2(1+x)\\right)dx=\\frac{127}{20}\\zeta(3)-\\frac{8\\pi^2}{5}\\ln(\\varphi)$$ My idea was to consider the following integral: $$\\mathcal J(a)=\\int_0^1 \\frac{2x-1}{1+x-x^2}\\ln(a+x)\\ln(1+x)dx$$ So $I=4\\mathcal J(0)-\\mathcal J(1)$ . In order to evaluate $\\mathcal J(a)$ I tried to apply Feynman's trick: $$\\mathcal J'(a)=\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\ln(1+x)}{a+x}\\frac{dx}{\\varphi-x}-\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\ln(1+x)}{a+x}\\frac{dx}{\\frac{1}{\\varphi}+x},\\quad \\varphi=\\frac{1+\\sqrt 5}{2}$$ $$\\small =\\frac{1}{a+\\varphi}\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\ln(1+x)}{a+x}dx+\\frac{1}{a+\\varphi}\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\ln(1+x)}{\\varphi-x}dx+\\frac{1}{a-\\frac{1}{\\varphi}}\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\ln(1+x)}{a+x}dx-\\frac{1}{a-\\frac{1}{\\varphi}}\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\ln(1+x)}{\\frac{1}{\\varphi}+x}dx$$ But I gave up on this idea after I realised that: $$\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\ln(1+x)}{t+x}dx=\\ln 2\\ln \\left(\\frac{t+1}{t-1}\\right)+\\operatorname{Li}_2\\left(\\frac{2}{1-t}\\right)-\\operatorname{Li}_2\\left(\\frac{1}{1-t}\\right)$$ Where $\\operatorname{Li}_2(x)$ is the Dilogarithm.\nOther methods weren't promising either, such as the substitution $x=\\frac{1-t}{1+t}$ , to combine the integral with it's sister one that has the denominator $1-x+x^2$ , or to integrate by parts which gives: $$\\small 2I=2\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\ln(1+x-x^2)\\ln x}{1+x}dx+2\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\ln(1+x-x^2)\\ln(1+x)}{x}dx-\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\ln(1+x-x^2)\\ln (1+x)}{1+x}dx$$ I believe that the factor of $4$ plays a big role into obtain nicely this result and one shouldn't split the integral into two parts, but I had no success and I would appreciate some help.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe original question is about evaluating a specific integral, and the user tried several methods like Feynman's trick, substitution, and integration by parts. The problem statement is to prove that the integral I equals (127/20)ζ(3) - (8π²/5)ln(φ), where φ is the golden ratio.\n\nNow, for the assumptions. The integral is from 0 to 1, the integrand is given, and there are specific substitutions and transformations mentioned. However, the assumptions in the example provided earlier were about the variables involved. Here, the main elements are the integral's limits (0 to 1), the integrand's structure, and maybe the use of φ (the golden ratio). Since the problem doesn't state any explicit conditions on variables outside the integral, the main assumptions are about the integral setup. \n\nThe integral is ∫₀¹ [(2x-1)/(1+x−x²)][4 ln x ln(1+x) − (ln(1+x))²] dx. So the integrand has two parts: a rational function and a logarithmic expression. The problem is to evaluate this integral and show it equals the given expression involving ζ(3), π², and ln(φ). \n\nLooking at the example, the assumptions listed were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. In this case, the integral's bounds are fixed (0 to 1), the functions involved (logarithms, rational function), and maybe the use of φ = (1+√5)/2. But φ here is a constant, not a variable, so perhaps that's part of the problem statement rather than an assumption.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- The integral is from 0 to 1.\n- The integrand is (2x−1)/(1+x−x²) multiplied by [4 ln x ln(1+x) − (ln(1+x))²].\n- The golden ratio φ is defined as (1+√5)/2. (But is this an assumption or part of the problem? Since φ is a standard constant, maybe it's not an assumption. The problem statement includes φ in the answer, so perhaps it's part of the problem to use that definition.)\n\nWait, the original problem statement says \"Prove that I = ... ln(φ)\", so φ is given as the golden ratio. Therefore, defining φ is part of the problem's answer, not an assumption. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- The integral is evaluated over the interval [0, 1].\n- The integrand is [(2x - 1)/(1 + x - x²)][4 ln x ln(1 + x) - (ln(1 + x))²].\n- The functions ln x and ln(1 + x) are defined on the interval (0, 1].\n\nBut maybe the problem doesn't have explicit assumptions beyond the integral setup. The example's assumptions were about the variable's properties. Here, the integral is definite, so the variables are integrated out. The key elements are the limits of integration and the integrand's structure. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- Integration variable x ranges from 0 to 1.\n- The denominator 1 + x - x² is non-zero in the interval [0, 1]. (But maybe that's an implicit condition. Since the user didn't mention any issues with the denominator, perhaps we don't need to state it as an assumption unless the problem states it.)\n\nWait, the original problem doesn't mention any conditions on the denominator. But we should check if 1 + x - x² is ever zero in [0,1]. Solving 1 + x - x² = 0: x² - x -1 =0, roots (1 ±√5)/2. The positive root is (1 +√5)/2 ≈ 1.618, which is outside [0,1]. The other root is negative, so denominator doesn't vanish in [0,1], so no division by zero. Hence, no assumption needed here.\n\nTherefore, the main assumptions are:\n\n- The integral is from 0 to 1.\n- The integrand is as specified.\n\nBut in the example, the assumption was on the variable n. Here, the variable x is integrated over [0,1], so maybe the assumptions are just the integral bounds and the integrand's form.\n\nSo, formatted:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is computed over the interval [0, 1],\nThe integrand is \\(\\frac{2x - 1}{1 + x - x^2} \\left(4 \\ln x \\ln(1 + x) - (\\ln(1 + x))^2 \\right)\\).\n\nProblem:\nProve that\n\\[\nI = \\int_0^1 \\frac{2x - 1}{1 + x - x^2} \\left(4 \\ln x \\ln(1 + x) - (\\ln(1 + x))^2 \\right) dx = \\frac{127}{20} \\zeta(3) - \\frac{8 \\pi^2}{5} \\ln(\\varphi)\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\varphi = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\).\n\nWait, but in the example, the problem statement includes the expression to prove. So the problem part here should include the integral equals the given expression. The φ definition is part of the problem statement, not an assumption.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are about the integral setup, and the problem is to prove the equality with the given value involving ζ(3), π², and ln(φ). So the final formatted problem should have the assumptions as the integral bounds and integrand, and the problem is to prove the equality.",
