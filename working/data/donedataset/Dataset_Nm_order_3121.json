    "Content": "Is there a known \"elementary\" proof that there are infinitely many\n  primes congruent to 7 modulo 10? Dirichlet's well known theorem gives that there are infinitely many such primes, as 10 and 7 are coprime. But Dirichlet's result is not \"elementary\" (even though one can in essence give a real variable proof. I am using elementary here in a somewhat intuitive sense). There is a well-known result of Murty showing that there is no \"Euclidean\" proof of this fact (see here and here ). One way of formalizing Murty's result is by saying that, for $a,m$ relatively prime, a polynomial for $a,m$ is a $p\\in{\\mathbb Z}[x]$ such that for all but finitely many $n$, the prime factors of $p(n)$ are congruent to 1 or $a$ modulo $m$ and, infinitely often, the second possibility occurs. Murty argues that \"Euclidean\" proofs all produce such polynomials, and his proof gives that if there is such a $p$, then $a^2\\equiv 1\\pmod m$. In particular, there is no polynomial for $2,5$, so there is no Euclidean proof that there are infinitely many primes of the form $5t+2$ or, equivalently, $10t+7$. But an elementary proof does not need to be a \"Euclidean\" proof. I would settle for a proof that uses a modest amount of algebraic number theory. I would even be happy if it turns out that no elementary proof is known, but a proof that does not require the full machinery of Dirichlet's theorem is possible. Finally, I would also like to know of a source giving a more or less complete list of pairs $(a,b)$ for which there are known elementary proofs that there are infinitely many primes of the form $at+b$. I know Narkiewicz discusses some pairs in section 2.5 of his \"The development of prime number theory\" and refers to Dickson's \"History of the theory of numbers\". It may be these are the sources. But just in case there are some others, I would appreciate a reference.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "One thing: this MO discussion is relevant. A second thing: I know that you asked to avoid the machinery of Dirichlet's proof, but I just wanted to point out that this proof is not so complicated, except for the proof that $L(1,\\chi) \\neq 0$ when $\\chi$ is a quadratic character.  (See e.g. the treatment in Serre's Course in arithmetic , or any other text.) But for any fixed choice of $a$ and $b$, this non-vanishing can be obtained in an elementary way.  E.g. for primes of the form $5 t + 2$, the relevant quadratic Dirichlet series is\n$$1 - 1/2 - 1/3 + 1/4 + \\cdots + 1/(5n+1) - 1/(5n+2) - 1/(5n+3) + 1/(5n+4) + \\cdots,$$\nand one can see this is positive, by noting that\n$1/(5n+1) - 1/(5n+2) - 1/(5n+3) + 1/(5n+4) = 1/(5n+1)(5n+2)-1/(5n+3)(5n+4) > 0.$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to format this Math Stack Exchange question according to the user's instructions. First, I need to identify the key parts of the problem and list the assumptions properly.\n\nThe original question is asking about an elementary proof for infinitely many primes congruent to 7 modulo 10. The user mentions Dirichlet's theorem but notes it's not elementary. They reference Murty's result that there's no Euclidean proof for this case. The problem is to find if there's an elementary proof (not necessarily Euclidean) or perhaps using some algebraic number theory but not the full Dirichlet theorem.\n\nSo, the assumptions here would be based on the conditions given. The main objects here are primes congruent to 7 mod 10. The user states that 10 and 7 are coprime, which is true, but since Dirichlet's theorem already covers that, the assumption here isn't about coprimality but rather about the method of proof. However, the user is seeking an elementary proof, so maybe the assumptions are about the form of the primes and the type of proof allowed.\n\nWait, the user mentions Murty's result that there's no Euclidean proof because such proofs require a polynomial with certain properties, which isn't possible here. But the question allows for elementary proofs that might use some algebraic number theory, just not the full Dirichlet machinery.\n\nSo the key assumptions I can list are:\n\n- Primes are congruent to 7 modulo 10.\n- The proof should be elementary (not using Dirichlet's theorem).\n- The proof does not need to be Euclidean (since Murty showed that's impossible).\n- The user is open to proofs using some algebraic number theory.\n\nBut each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. Let me parse the problem again.\n\nThe problem is: \"Is there a known elementary proof that there are infinitely many primes congruent to 7 modulo 10?\" The user also mentions that Dirichlet's theorem isn't elementary and that Murty showed no Euclidean proof exists. They are looking for a proof that might use some algebraic number theory but not the full Dirichlet theorem. Additionally, they want a reference for pairs (a,b) with elementary proofs.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n1. The primes in question are congruent to 7 modulo 10.\n2. The proof must be elementary (not using Dirichlet's theorem).\n3. The proof may use some algebraic number theory.\n4. The proof does not need to be Euclidean (as per Murty's result).\n\nBut the user might not explicitly state all of these. The main problem is to prove there are infinitely many primes ≡7 mod 10 with an elementary method. The assumptions would be the conditions given for the proof's requirements. Let me try to structure this.\n\nAssumptions:\n- Primes are considered in the arithmetic progression 10n + 7.\n- The proof should avoid using Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions.\n- The proof may utilize algebraic number theory but not the full machinery of Dirichlet's theorem.\n\nBut the user says \"elementary\" which might mean avoiding complex analysis or heavy algebraic number theory. However, the user is flexible, allowing some algebraic number theory. So perhaps the key assumptions are:\n\n- The primes in question are of the form 10n + 7.\n- An elementary proof is sought (not requiring Dirichlet's theorem).\n- The proof is allowed to use a modest amount of algebraic number theory.\n\nBut each assumption should apply to one object. Let me check the example given. In the example, the assumptions were \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" So each is a property of n.\n\nIn this problem, the objects are primes of the form 10n +7. The conditions are about the type of proof (elementary, not Dirichlet, possibly some algebraic number theory). But maybe the main assumption is just that the primes are congruent to 7 mod 10, and the problem is to prove infinitude with an elementary method. The rest are context about what's allowed in the proof.\n\nThe user is asking for the problem to be structured into Assumptions and Problem. The Assumptions should list the problem's conditions. Since the problem is about primes congruent to 7 mod 10, the main assumption is that primes are in that form, and the requirement is for an elementary proof. However, in the example, the assumption included a divisibility condition (n divisible by 7). Here, the problem's assumption is that the primes are 7 mod10, and the proof needs to be elementary. But the user also mentions that 10 and 7 are coprime, which is necessary for Dirichlet's theorem, but since they aren't using Dirichlet, maybe that's not an assumption here.\n\nWait, the original example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" The problem was to prove divisibility by 91, which factors into 7 and 13. The assumption was about n being divisible by 7. So maybe in this case, the assumptions are about the primes being 7 mod10 and that the proof must be elementary, not using Dirichlet. But the user is asking to structure the problem, not the answer. So the problem is to prove there are infinitely many primes ≡7 mod10, with the conditions that the proof is elementary (not Dirichlet), and allowed to use some algebraic number theory.\n\nBut how to phrase that as assumptions? Each assumption addresses one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\n- Primes are congruent to 7 modulo 10.\n- The proof must be elementary (i.e., not using Dirichlet's theorem).\n- The proof may use a modest amount of algebraic number theory.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is simply to prove there are infinitely many primes ≡7 mod10, and the assumptions are the conditions given. The user is asking for the problem to be structured with assumptions and problem. The example's assumptions were about the variables, here the assumptions might be about the proof method. But the example's assumptions were properties of the mathematical objects, not the proof. So perhaps here, the only mathematical assumption is that primes are congruent to 7 mod10, but the rest are part of the problem's request. Wait, the example had two assumptions: n is integer and n divisible by 7. Both are about the variable in the problem.\n\nIn this case, the problem is about primes congruent to 7 mod10. So the assumption is that the primes are in the form 10n +7, but that's part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Wait, maybe the assumptions are the given conditions. The user is asking to prove there are infinitely many primes congruent to 7 mod10, and the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. But in the example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the assumptions were n is integer and divisible by7. So perhaps here, the assumption is that 10 and7 are coprime? But that's given. Wait, the original example's problem was to prove divisibility by91, which is 7*13. The assumption was n is an integer and divisible by7. Maybe here, the assumption is that the primes are congruent to7 mod10, but that's the problem's statement. I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, looking at the example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- n is an integer,\n- n is divisible by7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by91.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted version, they added an assumption that n is divisible by7. So they added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem? Wait, no, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted example, the assumption includes that n is divisible by7. That seems like a mistake. Wait, the original problem is to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by91. But in the formatted problem, they list assumptions as n is an integer, n is divisible by7. Then the problem is to prove divisibility by91. Wait, that seems incorrect. Because the original problem's assumption is that n is any integer, but the formatted version adds that n is divisible by7, which restricts it. But that's not the original problem. So perhaps the example has an error. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in their example. Because if the original problem is for every integer n, then the formatted problem should not add that n is divisible by7. That would change the problem. So perhaps the example is incorrect, but following the user's instructions, they want to list assumptions, which may include conditions from the problem. So perhaps in the example, maybe the original problem had n divisible by7? Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists n divisible by7 as an assumption. That seems like a mistake. But the user provided that example, so perhaps they want to extract the assumptions from the problem, even if they are implicit. But maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the example, the user made a mistake and the original problem was for n divisible by7. But regardless, following the user's format, I need to structure the current problem.\n\nThe current problem is: \"Is there a known elementary proof that there are infinitely many primes congruent to 7 modulo 10?\" The user provides context about Dirichlet and Murty's results. The task is to structure this into Assumptions and Problem.\n\nThe problem is to prove there are infinitely many primes ≡7 mod10. The assumptions would be the conditions given in the problem. The user mentions that 10 and7 are coprime (which is a condition for Dirichlet's theorem), but the problem is to find an elementary proof. The assumptions here might be:\n\n- 10 and 7 are coprime.\n- The proof must be elementary (not using Dirichlet's theorem).\n- The proof may use algebraic number theory but not the full Dirichlet machinery.\n\nBut each assumption should apply to one object. The coprimality is a property of 10 and7. The proof method is about the approach. However, in the example, the assumptions were about the variable n. Here, the problem is about primes in an arithmetic progression, so the key mathematical assumption is that 10 and7 are coprime, which allows the existence of infinitely many primes in that progression (by Dirichlet). But since we're not using Dirichlet, maybe that's not an assumption here. The problem is to prove the infinitude without Dirichlet, so perhaps the only assumption is that primes are ≡7 mod10, and the problem is to prove there are infinitely many such primes with an elementary proof.\n\nBut I need to follow the example, even if it's possibly flawed. In the example, the original problem was about every integer n, but the formatted version added an assumption that n is divisible by7. That suggests that maybe the user wants to extract any implicit conditions. But in the current problem, the key conditions are:\n\n- Primes are congruent to7 modulo10.\n- The proof should be elementary (not using Dirichlet's theorem).\n- The proof does not need to be Euclidean (as per Murty's result).\n\nBut each assumption must be about one property of one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- Primes are considered in the arithmetic progression 10n +7.\n- The proof must avoid Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions.\n- The proof is allowed to use algebraic number theory methods.\n- The proof does not need to conform to Euclidean-style proofs (as per Murty's result).\n\nBut the user's example had two assumptions about n. Here, perhaps the key assumption is that the primes are in the form 10n +7, and the proof must be elementary. The other points are more about the approach rather than assumptions. However, the user's example included an assumption about divisibility, which was part of the problem's conditions. So perhaps in this case, the only assumption is:\n\n- Primes congruent to7 modulo10.\n\nBut the problem is to prove there are infinitely many such primes with an elementary proof. The rest are contextual requirements. The user wants to know if such a proof exists, so the problem is to prove infinitude under the condition of an elementary proof. But how to phrase that? The example included an assumption about n's divisibility, even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n\". So perhaps in this case, even though the original problem is to prove for primes ≡7 mod10, the assumption is that such primes exist and the proof must be elementary. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the assumption could be that 10 and7 are coprime, which is necessary for the application of Dirichlet's theorem, but since we're not using it, maybe that's not needed. Alternatively, perhaps the assumption is that there is no Euclidean proof (from Murty's result), but that's more of a given fact than an assumption.\n\nI think the main point is to structure the problem as per the example. The example took the original problem, extracted the conditions (even if they were part of the problem statement) as assumptions. So here, the original problem is to prove there are infinitely many primes ≡7 mod10 with an elementary proof. The assumptions would be:\n\n- Primes are congruent to7 modulo10.\n- The proof must be elementary (not using Dirichlet's theorem).\n\nBut the example had two assumptions about n. Here, the problem is about primes in an AP, so the first assumption is about the primes being in that AP. The second assumption is about the proof method being elementary. However, the example's assumptions were about the variable in the problem (n being integer and divisible by7), whereas here, the assumptions would be about the primes and the proof method. The user's instructions say \"assumptions of the problem should be listed line by line. Each assumption addresses only one property or condition, applied to one object.\"\n\nSo maybe the assumptions here are:\n\n- The primes in question are congruent to7 modulo10.\n- The proof is required to be elementary (not employing Dirichlet's theorem).\n\nBut the problem is to prove there are infinitely many such primes. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- Primes are congruent to7 modulo10.\n- The proof must be elementary (not using Dirichlet's theorem).\n\nProblem: Prove that there are infinitely many primes congruent to7 modulo10.\n\nBut the user's original question includes more context, like Murty's result and allowing some algebraic number theory. However, the format requires filtering unrelated information. The example filtered out the original problem's context about the number A(n) and focused on the divisibility by91 with the assumption about n. So here, we need to filter out the discussion about Murty, Euclidean proofs, references, etc., and just state the core problem with its assumptions.\n\nSo the key problem is to prove there are infinitely many primes ≡7 mod10 with an elementary proof. The assumptions are:\n\n- The primes are congruent to7 modulo10.\n- The proof is elementary (not using Dirichlet's theorem).\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about the variable (n is integer, n divisible by7), leading to the problem to prove divisibility by91. Here, the variable is the primes, so the assumption is their congruence class and the proof method's restriction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the only assumption is that the primes are congruent to7 mod10, and the problem is to prove their infinitude with an elementary method. The rest (Dirichlet's theorem not being used) is part of the problem's requirement, not an assumption.\n\nBut the example included two assumptions about n. So perhaps in this problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The arithmetic progression is 10n +7.\n- The proof does not use Dirichlet's theorem.\n\nBut \"the arithmetic progression is 10n +7\" is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the assumption is that there exists a prime congruent to7 mod10, but that's not necessary since we're proving infinitude.\n\nThis is a bit tricky. Given the user's example, which seems to have taken parts of the problem statement as assumptions, perhaps here the assumptions are:\n\n- Primes congruent to7 modulo10 are considered.\n- The proof must be elementary.\n\nBut the original problem's main assumption is that the primes are in that form, and the proof has to be elementary. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- Primes are congruent to7 modulo10.\n- The proof is elementary (not using Dirichlet's theorem).\n\nProblem: Prove that there are infinitely many primes congruent to7 modulo10.\n\nThis seems to align with the example, where the original problem had a general statement, and the formatted version added specific assumptions. However, in the example, the formatted version added an assumption (n divisible by7) that wasn't in the original problem's statement. That suggests that the user might want to include any conditions necessary for the problem, even if they were not explicitly stated. But in the current problem, the original question is about proving infinitude with an elementary proof, so the assumption is the method (elementary) and the primes' congruence.\n\nI think this is the best approach, following the example's structure even if it's a bit confusing. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- Primes are congruent to7 modulo10.\n- The proof must be elementary (not using Dirichlet's theorem).\n\nProblem: Prove that there are infinitely many primes congruent to7 modulo10.\n\nBut the user's original question also mentions that 10 and7 are coprime, which is necessary for Dirichlet's theorem, but since they are not using Dirichlet, maybe that's an assumption. However, coprimality is a given, so it's not an assumption. The key assumptions are the congruence and the proof method.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumption is that 10 and7 are coprime. But in the example, the assumption was about the variable n, not the coefficients. So perhaps not.\n\nGiven the user's example, where the original problem was for all integers n, but the formatted version added an assumption about n divisible by7, I think the user wants to extract any conditions or constraints from the problem and list them as assumptions. In the current problem, the constraints are:\n\n1. The primes are of the form 10n +7.\n2. The proof must be elementary (not using Dirichlet's theorem).\n\nSo those would be the assumptions. The problem is to prove there are infinitely many such primes under those assumptions.",
