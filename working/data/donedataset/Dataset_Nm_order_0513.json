    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So the user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given question into the specified format. The example provided shows how to list assumptions and then state the problem. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original question from Math Stack Exchange. The title is about generalizing the Dominated Convergence Theorem. The user is asking for a proof where pointwise convergence is replaced by convergence in measure, given a σ-finite measure. They also mention the statement of the theorem, which includes the conditions that |f_n| ≤ g, f_n converges to f in measure, and the conclusions about the integrals.\n\nNow, I need to filter out the unrelated information. The original question mentions Wikipedia's claim, the thanks, and the request for a proof source. Those are not part of the mathematical assumptions or the problem statement. The key mathematical elements here are the σ-finite measure, the domination by g, convergence in measure, and the integral conclusions.\n\nBreaking down the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property. So first, the measure μ is σ-finite. Then, the sequence f_n is dominated by g, meaning |f_n| ≤ g. Next, f_n converges to f in measure. Also, g is integrable, since in DCT, g needs to be integrable to apply the theorem. Wait, the original DCT requires g to be integrable. Does the user's statement mention that? The problem statement here says \"|f_n| ≤ g\" but does it specify that g is integrable? Let me check the original question again. The user wrote: \"Let μ be σ-finite, |f_n| ≤ g and f_n→f in measure, then we must have...\" So they mention |f_n| ≤ g but don't explicitly say g is integrable. However, in the standard DCT, g must be integrable. So maybe that's an implicit assumption here? But the user didn't state it. Wait, but to properly state the theorem, the assumption that g is integrable is necessary. Otherwise, the theorem might not hold. So perhaps this is an oversight in the original question. But as per the user's problem statement, they included \"|f_n| ≤ g\" but not that g is integrable. So should I include that as an assumption or not?\n\nThe example given by the user includes assumptions that are explicit in the original problem. For instance, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption adds \"n is divisible by 7\" which might be part of the problem's context. Wait, no, looking back at the example, the original problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example was a different problem? Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, the assumption is \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" That seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps there was a mistake in the example? Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds that n is divisible by 7 as an assumption, which would restrict the problem. Maybe that's a typo or an error in the example. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instruction to structure the current problem.\n\nSo back to the current problem. The user provided the statement of the theorem as: Let μ be σ-finite, |f_n| ≤ g and f_n→f in measure, then ∫f_n → ∫f and ∫|f_n - f| → 0. To structure this properly, the assumptions should include:\n\n1. μ is a σ-finite measure.\n2. For all n, |f_n| ≤ g.\n3. f_n converges to f in measure.\n4. g is integrable (since otherwise, the theorem doesn't hold; but the original problem statement from the user doesn't mention this. However, in the standard DCT, g must be integrable. So maybe this is an implicit assumption. But does the user's statement include that? The user wrote \"|f_n| ≤ g\" without mentioning integrability. Hmm.\n\nBut the problem is to structure the problem as per the given example. In the example, the original problem didn't mention that n is divisible by 7, but the formatted problem added that. So maybe the user is expecting to extract all assumptions from the problem statement, even if they are not explicitly stated but necessary. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, which is correct. Then why is \"n is divisible by 7\" also an assumption? That seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut that contradicts the original problem's \"for every integer n\". So perhaps the example is incorrect or perhaps the user made a mistake. But regardless, the instruction is to follow the format, so maybe in that example, there was an error, but for the current problem, I should proceed as per the user's instruction.\n\nIn the current problem, the user states the theorem as: Let μ be σ-finite, |f_n| ≤ g, and f_n→f in measure, then the integrals converge. So the assumptions here are:\n\n- μ is σ-finite.\n\n- For all n, |f_n| ≤ g.\n\n- f_n converges to f in measure.\n\nBut for the Dominated Convergence Theorem, the standard assumption is that g is integrable. So perhaps the user missed stating that. But in their problem statement, they do not mention g being integrable. So as per the given problem, should we include that as an assumption?\n\nWait, the original DCT requires that g is integrable. So if the theorem is stated as in the user's question without that condition, then the theorem is incorrect. Therefore, it's likely that the user intended g to be integrable. Therefore, even if the user didn't explicitly mention it, perhaps it's a necessary assumption. So, should I include \"g is integrable\" as an assumption?\n\nLooking back at the example, perhaps the user included more assumptions than explicitly stated. For instance, the original example problem says \"for every integer n\", which is the only assumption, but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". Which is incorrect unless there was a miscommunication. But perhaps the user intended to show that even if in the original problem some assumptions are implicit, we have to list all necessary ones. But that's unclear. However, in the current problem, since the user is directly quoting the theorem statement from Wikipedia, which probably includes that g is integrable, but the user's version might have omitted it. However, in the user's problem statement, they write \"Let μ be σ-finite, |f_n| ≤ g and f_n→f in measure, then...\". So according to that, the assumptions are μ is σ-finite, |f_n| ≤ g, and convergence in measure. So following that, the assumptions would be those three. But in reality, the theorem requires g to be integrable. Therefore, perhaps the user's problem statement is incomplete. However, since I'm supposed to structure the problem as per the user's description, not to correct it, then maybe I should stick to the assumptions as stated by the user, even if they are incomplete. But then again, in the example, the user added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, no. In the example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem lists assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" That's conflicting because the original says \"for every integer n\" but the formatted problem restricts it to n divisible by 7. So maybe the example is incorrect. Perhaps there was a miscommunication. Maybe the original problem in the example was actually to prove divisibility by 91 when n is divisible by 7, but the user wrote it wrong. But regardless, I need to follow the instructions.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's statement of the theorem includes μ being σ-finite, |f_n| ≤ g, f_n converging to f in measure, and the conclusions. So according to the user's problem statement, the assumptions are μ is σ-finite, |f_n| ≤ g, and convergence in measure. However, to make the theorem valid, g must be integrable. So perhaps the user omitted that. But since the user is asking for the problem to be structured as per their given statement, perhaps I shouldn't add assumptions they didn't mention. But maybe the σ-finite measure implies that the space is σ-finite, but that's separate from g being integrable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's problem statement does include that g is integrable, but it's written in the theorem statement. Let me re-read the user's problem statement:\n\n\"Let μ be σ-finite, |f_n|≤g and f_n→f in measure, then we must have ∫f_n→∫f and ∫|f_n−f|→0\"\n\nThe standard DCT requires that g is integrable. So in this case, is the assumption that |f_n| ≤ g and g is integrable? Or is the assumption only |f_n| ≤ g? If the user's theorem statement does not mention that g is integrable, then the theorem is not correct. Therefore, perhaps in the problem statement, the user intended that g is integrable, but forgot to write it. Alternatively, maybe the original Wikipedia statement includes that, and the user just paraphrased it incompletely.\n\nGiven that the user is asking for the problem to be structured with assumptions, and given the example where assumptions were split into separate lines, I need to extract all the assumptions from the problem statement as presented.\n\nLooking at the user's problem statement:\n\n\"Let μ be σ-finite, |f_n|≤g and f_n→f in measure, then we must have ∫f_n→∫f and ∫|f_n−f|→0\"\n\nSo the assumptions listed here are:\n\n1. μ is σ-finite.\n\n2. For all n, |f_n| ≤ g.\n\n3. f_n converges to f in measure.\n\nThe conclusion is about the convergence of integrals.\n\nBut in the standard theorem, you also need that g is integrable. So if the user's problem statement does not include that, then the problem is ill-posed. However, since the user is quoting the theorem as stated, perhaps in the Wikipedia version, they do require g to be integrable. Therefore, maybe the user included that implicitly. Wait, in the standard DCT, the domination by g and g being integrable are both required. So perhaps the user's statement assumes that g is integrable, but just wrote |f_n| ≤g, and in the context of DCT, that implies g is integrable. However, in the problem structuring, should we list that as a separate assumption?\n\nIn the example provided by the user, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which is an assumption, but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, which is correct. But the example also adds \"n is divisible by 7\" which was not in the original problem, which seems incorrect. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. Therefore, maybe in their intended format, they want all explicit and implicit assumptions listed. However, given the confusion, perhaps I should proceed with the assumptions explicitly mentioned in the problem statement, even if they are incomplete. Alternatively, if the user's example added an extra assumption, perhaps we need to infer the correct ones.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example had a different original problem. Wait, perhaps the original problem in the example was to prove divisibility by 91 when n is divisible by 7, but the user wrote \"for every integer n\". That would explain why the formatted problem includes \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. So perhaps there was a mistake in the example's original problem statement.\n\nGiven that, perhaps in the current problem, I should follow the user's instructions to extract the assumptions as per the problem statement provided. So the user's problem statement says \"Let μ be σ-finite, |f_n|≤g and f_n→f in measure\". So these are three separate conditions. Therefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n1. μ is a σ-finite measure.\n\n2. For all n, |f_n| ≤ g.\n\n3. f_n converges to f in measure.\n\nAdditionally, in the standard theorem, g must be integrable. But since the user's problem statement does not mention that, but the conclusion requires it, perhaps the user forgot to include it. But as per the user's example, they might have added assumptions that were not explicitly stated. For example, in their example, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem says \"for every integer n\". That seems like a mistake. However, perhaps in the current problem, we should include all necessary assumptions, even if not stated. But how to decide?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original problem's statement in the example was different. Suppose the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 when n is divisible by 7, but the user wrote it as \"for every integer n\". Then the formatted problem correctly lists the assumptions. But since I don't have the original problem, I can't tell. However, given the instructions, I have to rely on the user's provided example.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the safest way is to list the assumptions as stated in the problem statement. So for the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- μ is σ-finite.\n\n- For all n, |f_n| ≤ g.\n\n- f_n converges to f in measure.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that ∫f_n → ∫f and ∫|f_n - f| → 0.\n\nHowever, without the integrability of g, the theorem is not true. Therefore, perhaps the user intended to include that g is integrable, but it's missing in the problem statement. But since the user is asking to format the problem as per their input, perhaps we should proceed with what's given.\n\nBut to match standard theorems, the assumption that g is integrable is necessary. Therefore, maybe in the problem statement, even though the user didn't write it, it's part of the theorem's assumptions. Therefore, perhaps the user's statement is incomplete, but we should include \"g is integrable\" as an assumption.\n\nBut how to confirm? The user's problem statement says \"Wikipedia claims, if σ-finite the DCT is still true when pointwise convergence is replaced by convergence in measure...\" The standard DCT requires g to be integrable. So in the Wikipedia statement, they probably include that g is integrable. Therefore, even if the user's paraphrase omitted it, it's a necessary assumption. Therefore, as a knowledgeable professor, I should include it.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n1. μ is a σ-finite measure.\n\n2. For all n, |f_n| ≤ g.\n\n3. g is integrable (i.e., ∫g dμ < ∞).\n\n4. f_n converges to f in measure.\n\nBut the user's problem statement does not mention (3). However, since the theorem is not valid without it, and the user is quoting a theorem from Wikipedia which likely includes that, perhaps it's an implicit assumption. Therefore, to correctly state the theorem, we need to include that g is integrable.\n\nHence, the assumptions are:\n\n- μ is σ-finite.\n\n- For all n, |f_n| ≤ g.\n\n- g is integrable.\n\n- f_n converges to f in measure.\n\nBut in the user's problem statement, only the first three are mentioned (μ σ-finite, |f_n| ≤g, convergence in measure). The integrability of g is not stated, but it's necessary. Therefore, perhaps the user expects it to be included. In the example, they added an assumption not present in the original problem, but that might have been a mistake. Given that, I think the correct approach is to include the integrability of g as an assumption, even if the user's problem statement didn't mention it, because otherwise the theorem is false. Therefore, the assumptions are as above.\n\nThus, structuring the problem:\n\nAssumption:\nμ is a σ-finite measure,\nFor all n, |f_n| ≤ g,\ng is integrable,\nf_n converges to f in measure.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ∫f_n → ∫f and ∫|f_n - f| → 0.\n\nBut let's check the original user's problem statement again. They write: \"Let μ be σ-finite, |f_n|≤g and f_n→f in measure, then we must have ∫f_n→∫f and ∫|f_n−f|→0\". There's no mention of g being integrable. So if we strictly follow the user's problem statement, we would not include it. However, since the theorem is not true without it, perhaps the user intended it. This is a dilemma. In academic settings, when a student omits a necessary condition, the professor would point it out. Since the user wants me to act as a professor, perhaps I should include the missing assumption. Therefore, I will list \"g is integrable\" as an assumption.\n\nHence, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nμ is a σ-finite measure,\nFor all n, |f_n| ≤ g,\ng is integrable,\nf_n converges to f in measure.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ∫f_n → ∫f and ∫|f_n - f| → 0.\n\nI think this is the correct approach. Even though the user's problem statement didn't mention the integrability of g, it's a necessary condition for the theorem to hold, so it's an implicit assumption. Therefore, including it makes the problem statement accurate.",
