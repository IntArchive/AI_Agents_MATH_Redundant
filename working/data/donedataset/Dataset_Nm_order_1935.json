    "Content": "Suppose $f$ is a continuous function at $x = c$ in $[a,b]$ .  Prove that for any sequence ${x_n}$ in $[a,b]$ converging to $c$ , the sequence $\\{f(x_n)\\}$ converges to $f(c)$ .  That is, $$ \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f(x_n)= f\\left(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}x_n\\right)$$ This proof seems simple but there are a few things that I need to know first.

    "AcceptedAnswer": "Just write down the definitions: $x_n$ converges to $c$ if and only if $\\forall \\delta > 0$ there exists $N = N(\\delta)$ such that $\\forall n \\ge N$ we have $|x_n - c| < \\delta$ $f$ is continuous if and only if $\\forall \\eta > 0$ there exists $\\gamma = \\gamma(\\eta)$ such that if $|x - y| < \\gamma$ then $|f(x) - f(y)| < \\eta$. Now we want to prove the following claim $\\forall \\epsilon > 0$ there exists $M = M(\\epsilon)$ such that if $n \\ge M$ then we have $|f(x_n) - f(c)| < \\epsilon$. Hint: if $x_n \\to c$ then you can make $|x_n - c|$ small enough to use the continuity of $f$ (say, for example, smaller than $\\gamma(\\epsilon)$).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about proving that for a continuous function f at a point c in [a,b], the limit of f(x_n) as n approaches infinity is equal to f applied to the limit of x_n, where x_n is any sequence in [a,b] converging to c.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. Let's see:\n\n1. The function f is defined on the interval [a,b]. That's one assumption.\n2. The function f is continuous at the point x = c within [a,b]. That's another assumption because continuity at a specific point is a distinct condition.\n3. There's a sequence {x_n} that's within the interval [a,b]. So, the sequence is in [a,b].\n4. The sequence {x_n} converges to c. That's a separate condition on the sequence.\n\nWait, the original problem states that the sequence is in [a,b] and converges to c. So each of these should be separate assumptions. The user's example broke down each condition, even if they relate to the same object. For example, in the sample, the assumptions were \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7,\" both about n but separate.\n\nSo here, for the sequence {x_n}, two assumptions: it's in [a,b], and it converges to c. Similarly, f being continuous at c is another assumption, and f being defined on [a,b] is another. Wait, but maybe f being defined on [a,b] is inherent in the problem statement. The problem says \"f is a continuous function at x = c in [a,b]\". So perhaps the domain is [a,b], so f is defined on [a,b]. Maybe that's an assumption. But does the problem explicitly state that f is defined on [a,b], or is it just continuous at c in [a,b]? The original problem says \"Suppose f is a continuous function at x = c in [a,b]\". So perhaps the domain is [a,b], so f is defined on [a,b]. So that's an assumption. Then, continuity at c is another.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- The function f is defined on the interval [a, b].\n- The function f is continuous at the point c in [a, b].\n- The sequence {x_n} is in the interval [a, b].\n- The sequence {x_n} converges to c.\n\nEach of these is a separate line. Now, the problem statement is to prove that lim_{n→∞} f(x_n) = f(lim_{n→∞} x_n). But in the original question, the user wrote it as \"the sequence {f(x_n)} converges to f(c)\", which is equivalent because lim x_n = c, so f(lim x_n) is f(c). So the problem statement can be phrased either way.\n\nSo putting it all together, the formatted problem should have the assumptions listed as above, each on a separate line, and then the problem statement as given.\n\nWait, but in the example given by the user, they included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. In the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem included an assumption \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, no, let me check. The original problem in the example was: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem adds an assumption \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original. Wait, that seems like a mistake. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. That's a problem. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect? Or maybe the user made a mistake in the example. But the user's example is part of the prompt, so I have to follow that structure even if there's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, perhaps the example was a typo. Let me check again. The original problem in the example says \"for every integer n\", and the formatted problem lists as assumptions \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That would mean that the problem in the formatted version is only for integers divisible by 7, which contradicts the original problem. So that seems like an error. But maybe the user intended that, perhaps the original problem had a typo, or the example was modified for illustration. Anyway, perhaps the user's example is correct in their own context, so I have to follow the format regardless.\n\nSo for the current problem, the assumptions should be each condition listed separately. Let me re-express the problem's conditions:\n\nThe user's problem states: \"Suppose f is a continuous function at x = c in [a,b]. Prove that for any sequence {x_n} in [a,b] converging to c, the sequence {f(x_n)} converges to f(c).\"\n\nBreaking this down:\n\n- f is defined on [a,b] (since it's continuous at c in [a,b], which is part of the domain)\n- f is continuous at c (a specific point in [a,b])\n- {x_n} is a sequence in [a,b]\n- {x_n} converges to c\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- The function f is defined on the interval [a, b].\n- The function f is continuous at the point c in [a, b].\n- The sequence {x_n} is in the interval [a, b].\n- The sequence {x_n} converges to c.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that lim_{n→∞} f(x_n) = f(c), which is equivalent to the sequence {f(x_n)} converging to f(c).\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is defined on the interval [a, b],\nf is continuous at the point c in [a, b],\nthe sequence {x_n} is in the interval [a, b],\nthe sequence {x_n} converges to c.\nProblem:\nProve that the sequence {f(x_n)} converges to f(c).\n\nAlternatively, using the original problem's wording: \"Prove that for any sequence {x_n} in [a,b] converging to c, the sequence {f(x_n)} converges to f(c).\"\n\nBut the user's example included LaTeX in the problem statement, so perhaps we need to present it with the equation.\n\nIn the original problem, the user wrote the problem as: \"the sequence {f(x_n)} converges to f(c). That is, lim_{n→∞} f(x_n) = f(lim_{n→∞} x_n).\"\n\nSo the problem statement can be phrased as either the sequence convergence or the equality of the limit of f(x_n) and f of the limit. But to match the example's style, maybe we should present it with the equation.\n\nSo the problem would be: Prove that $$ \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f(x_n)= f\\left(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}x_n\\right) $$.\n\nBut given that the problem is about sequences, the LaTeX would be appropriate. However, in the example, the problem included the A(n) expression with LaTeX. So the user likely expects the problem statement here to use LaTeX for the equation.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nf is defined on the interval [a, b],\nf is continuous at the point c in [a, b],\n{x_n} is a sequence in [a, b],\n{x_n} converges to c.\nProblem:\nProve that $$ \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f(x_n)= f\\left(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}x_n\\right) $$.\n\nBut wait, in the original question, the user wrote \"the sequence {f(x_n)} converges to f(c)\", which is equivalent because lim x_n is c. So the problem could be stated either way. To be precise, since the limit of x_n is c, f(lim x_n) is f(c). So the problem is to show that lim f(x_n) = f(c). However, the equation given in the original problem is lim f(x_n) = f(lim x_n), which is the same as f(c). So both are correct.\n\nI think the key is to follow the original problem's wording. The user's original problem states both: \"the sequence {f(x_n)} converges to f(c)\" and \"lim_{n→∞} f(x_n) = f(lim_{n→∞} x_n)\". So the problem can be presented as either. But to stick with the problem's title and the equation, perhaps present it as the equation.\n\nBut in the example, the problem was rephrased to include the equation. So in this case, using the equation would be appropriate.\n\nWait, in the user's example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted problem kept that as the problem statement with the LaTeX expression. Similarly here, the problem is to prove the equation given, so the formatted problem should present the equation.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem should have the four assumptions listed, and the problem is to prove the limit equation.",
