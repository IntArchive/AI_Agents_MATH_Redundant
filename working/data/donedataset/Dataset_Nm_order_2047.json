    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that the assumptions should list each condition applied to one object, and then the problem statement. \n\nFirst, looking at the original problem: It's about proving that the limit of a multiple integral as n approaches infinity is 2/3. The integral involves the average of the squares of n variables divided by the average of the variables themselves, all integrated over the unit cube [0,1]^n.\n\nSo, what are the assumptions here? The problem is about the convergence of this integral. Let's break down the components:\n\n1. The variables x1, x2, ..., xn are each integrated from 0 to 1. So each xi is in [0,1].\n2. The function being integrated is (x1² + x2² + ... + xn²)/(x1 + x2 + ... + xn).\n3. The limit is taken as n approaches infinity.\n\nBut in the example given earlier, assumptions were about the properties of the variables involved. For instance, in the example, n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, maybe the assumptions are that each xi is a variable integrated over [0,1], and that n is a positive integer approaching infinity. Wait, but the problem is about the limit as n goes to infinity, so perhaps the key assumptions are that each xi is in [0,1] and that the integral is over the n-dimensional cube. Also, the problem is about the convergence in probability, as mentioned in the title. However, the user wants assumptions that are each applied to one object. So each variable xi is integrated over [0,1], and the integral is over n variables. But the problem statement already includes that it's an integral over [0,1]^n, so maybe the assumption is that each xi is in [0,1], and that n is a positive integer. However, the example's assumption was \"n is an integer\", but here n is going to infinity, so perhaps that's part of the problem statement rather than an assumption. Wait, the example had the assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the original problem didn't state that. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, the expression is divisible by 91, but the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like an error. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect? Wait, let me check. The original example problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem under assumptions lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be a mistake. Wait, perhaps the example is wrong. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instructions. The user wants me to filter out unrelated information and structure the problem with assumptions and the problem statement. So for the given problem on Math Stack Exchange, the title mentions \"Convergence in probability\", but the question is about proving the limit of the integral equals 2/3. So perhaps the key assumptions here are that each variable xi is independently and uniformly distributed over [0,1], since the integral is over the unit cube with each variable integrated from 0 to 1. But the problem doesn't explicitly state that the variables are independent or their distribution, but since it's a multiple integral over [0,1]^n, that's the standard assumption. So possible assumptions:\n\n- For each i from 1 to n, xi is a real number in the interval [0,1].\n- The integral is taken over the n-dimensional cube [0,1]^n.\n- The limit is taken as n approaches infinity.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nEach variable xi is in [0,1],\nThe integral is over n variables,\nn approaches infinity.\n\nBut maybe more precisely:\n\nAssumption:\nFor each i, xi is a real number in [0,1],\nThe integral is with respect to the Lebesgue measure on [0,1]^n,\nn is a positive integer tending to infinity.\n\nHowever, the problem doesn't mention Lebesgue measure, but in the context of such integrals, it's standard. Alternatively, maybe just state the integral is over [0,1]^n. But the problem statement already includes the integral from 0 to 1 multiple times, so maybe the assumption is that each xi is integrated over [0,1]. So each xi is in [0,1], and the integral is over all variables x1 through xn. The problem is about the limit as n approaches infinity of this integral.\n\nSo structuring the assumptions as:\n\nAssumption:\nFor each i = 1, 2, ..., n, xi is a real number in the interval [0, 1],\nThe integral is over the n-dimensional hypercube [0,1]^n,\nThe limit is taken as n approaches infinity.\n\nBut the example given by the user for the previous problem had two assumptions: \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". So each assumption is a single condition on one object. Here, the objects are xi and n. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nEach variable xi is in [0, 1],\nn is a positive integer.\n\nBut the problem is about the limit as n approaches infinity, so maybe the assumption is that n approaches infinity, but that's part of the problem statement. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. That suggests that the user's example may have included an incorrect assumption, but perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions should include that each xi is in [0,1], and perhaps that the variables are independent? But the problem doesn't mention independence. Alternatively, perhaps the key assumption is just that the integral is over the unit cube, which implies each xi is in [0,1]. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nEach variable xi is integrated over [0,1],\nThe integral is taken over the n-dimensional unit cube [0,1]^n.\n\nBut the problem statement already mentions the integral from 0 to 1 multiple times, so maybe those are part of the problem statement, not the assumptions. Wait, the example included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption even though the problem says \"for every integer n\". So perhaps the assumptions are redundant with the problem statement. Hmm. Maybe the user wants to extract implicit assumptions. For instance, in the example, the problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is n is an integer. But the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original problem. That suggests that perhaps the user made a mistake in the example, or perhaps the original problem had a mistake. But regardless, following the instructions, I need to list all assumptions from the problem, each addressing one property applied to one object.\n\nIn the current problem, the integral is over [0,1]^n, so each xi is in [0,1], and n is a positive integer tending to infinity. But the problem is about the limit as n approaches infinity. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nFor each i = 1, 2, ..., n, xi ∈ [0, 1],\nThe integral is taken over the n-dimensional hypercube [0,1]^n,\nn is a positive integer.\n\nBut the problem is about the limit as n approaches infinity, which is part of the problem statement. So perhaps the assumptions are just the first two, since the problem states the limit as n→infty. Therefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nEach variable xi is in the interval [0, 1],\nThe integral is over the n-dimensional unit cube [0,1]^n.\n\nProblem:\nProve that\n$$\n\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\int_0^1 \\int_0^1 \\cdots \\int_0^1 \\frac{x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \\cdots + x_n^2}{x_1 + x_2 + \\cdots + x_n} dx_1 dx_2 \\cdots dx_n = \\frac{2}{3}\n$$\n\nI think that's the correct structure. The assumptions are that each variable is in [0,1] and the integral is over the unit cube. The problem is to find the limit as n approaches infinity of the integral.",
