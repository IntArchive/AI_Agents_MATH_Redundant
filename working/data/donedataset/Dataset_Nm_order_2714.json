Basically I want to show that a path in $R_{2n}$ with minimum value $k$ corresponds to a path in $N_{2n}$ with terminal value $2k$ . For this I'm thinking about cutting or shifting or reflecting paths. I don't think probability matters here. But I'm stuck on formulating the proofs. If we have sequence $S_0,S_1,...,S_n$ which is represented by a polygonal line with segments $(k-1,S_{k-1}) \\rightarrow (k,S_k)$ a path is a polygonal line that is a possible outcome of simple random walk.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let us introduce some notations for the paths we are considering. We will say that $\\omega$ is a path if $$\\omega: \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$$ satisfies $$\\omega(i+1)-\\omega(i)= \\pm 1, \\qquad \\omega(0) = 0.$$ Then all the required definitions translate to this setting. As a warmup, let us start with the bijection between $P_{2n}$ and $N_{2n -1}$ . Since any $\\omega \\in P_{n}$ satisfies by definition $\\omega(i) \\geq 1$ for $i \\geq 1$ we can define the map: $$\\varphi : P_{2n} \\to N_{2n-1}, \\qquad \\varphi(\\omega)(i) = \\omega(i+1)-1.$$ This is gust a left shift operation, where we eliminate the first line. The inverse is a right shift, where we simply push the whole pathe one line up. Now, let us pass to the more involved exercise: The bijection $R_{2n} \\to N_{2n}$ . For a given path $\\omega \\in R_{2n}$ we define $$\\mathrm{nmin}(\\omega) = \\{ m_1, \\ldots , m_{r(\\omega)} \\}$$ where $m_1 \\leq \\ldots \\leq m_{r(\\omega)}$ are all local minima such that $\\omega(m_j) <0$ and $\\omega(m_j) < \\omega(m_{k})$ for $j > k.$ With local minimum we mean $\\omega(i-1) > \\omega(i) < \\omega(i+1)$ . We now define $\\psi : R_{2n} \\to N_{2n}$ in the following way: $\\psi(\\omega)(i) = |\\omega(i)|$ for $0 \\leq i \\leq m_1$ . Now we attach the path between $m_1$ and $m_2$ and reflect it about $\\omega(m_1)$ . By this we mean: $$ \\psi(\\omega)(i) = |\\omega(m_1)| + |\\omega(i) - \\omega(m_1)|, \\qquad \\forall i \\in [m_1, m_2]. $$ We iterate this procedure until we reach $m_{r(\\omega)}$ and then iterate it one last time between $m_{r(\\omega)}$ and $2n.$ Clearly we have produced a path in $N_{2n}$ . We have to provide an algorithm to recover a path $\\omega$ from a path $\\omega^{\\prime}$ in $N_{2n}$ . We leave it as an exercise to see that this is indeed an inverse to $\\psi$ . The algorithm essentially follows the path backwards: Define $m = \\omega^\\prime(2n)/2 \\in \\mathbb{N}$ . Eventually $-m$ will be the global minimum of our path. Define $m_{r(\\omega)}$ the first time such that $\\omega(m_{r(\\omega)})=m.$ Define the set of increasing positive minima: $$\\mathrm{pmin}(\\omega^\\prime) = \\{ m_0 < \\bar{m}_1\\leq \\ldots  \\leq \\bar{m}_{r(\\omega) -1} \\leq m_{r(\\omega)}\\}$$ where $m_0$ is the largest time such that $\\omega^\\prime(m_0) = 0$ and $\\bar{m}_i$ is a local minimum for $\\omega^\\prime$ and $\\omega^\\prime(j) > \\omega^\\prime(\\bar{m}_i)$ for $ \\bar{m}_i < j$ . It may well be that this set is empty: This corresponds to the global minimum  being the first negative local minimum in $\\omega$ . For any $\\bar{m}_i$ define $$m_i = \\max \\{j \\leq \\bar{m}_i : \\omega^\\prime(j-1)< \\omega^\\prime (j) = \\omega^\\prime (\\bar{m}_i)\\}$$ If $m = 0$ we set $\\omega = \\omega^\\prime$ . Otherwise let $$\\omega(i) = \\omega^{\\prime}(i) -\\omega^\\prime(2n), \\qquad \\forall i \\in [m_{r(\\omega)}, 2n].$$ Then we iterate the following procedure (first step is backwards reflection until we find the previous minimum value): $$\\omega(i) = \\omega(m_{r(\\omega)})+(\\omega^\\prime(m_{r(\\omega)}) -\\omega^\\prime(i)), \\qquad \\forall i \\in [\\bar{m}_{r(\\omega)-1}, m_{r(\\omega)}].$$ And (second step, we follow the given path, until we reach the next local minima: Between $m_i$ and $\\bar{m}_i$ no reflection kick in): $$ \\omega(i) = \\omega(\\bar{m}_{r(\\omega)-1})+(\\omega^\\prime(i)-\\omega^\\prime(\\bar{m}_{r(\\omega)-1}) ), \\qquad \\forall i \\in [m_{r(\\omega)-1}, \\bar{m}_{r(\\omega)-1}].$$ Finally, $\\omega(i) = \\omega^\\prime(i)$ on $[0, m_0]$ and $\\omega(i) = -\\omega^\\prime(i)$ on $[m_0, m_1]$ . I think a picture does the job in th best way. I do not know how to produce one. Hopefully I did not forget some tricky detail in the description above :)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to break down this problem. The user wants to show two bijections: one between P_{2n} and N_{2n-1}, and another between R_{2n} and N_{2n}. They also mention a specific correspondence involving the minimum value of a path in R_{2n} and the terminal value in N_{2n}. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the definitions of each set. \n\nR_n is the set of simple random walk paths that return to the origin at step n. So S_n = 0. These are paths that start and end at 0 after n steps.\n\nP_n consists of paths where the walk stays strictly positive for all i from 1 to n. So S_i > 0 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. These are called positive walks or excursions.\n\nN_n has paths where the walk is non-negative for all i from 1 to n, meaning S_i ≥ 0. These are often called meanders or non-negative walks.\n\nThe user wants bijections between P_{2n} and N_{2n-1}, and between R_{2n} and N_{2n}. Also, they want to show that a path in R_{2n} with minimum value k corresponds to a path in N_{2n} ending at 2k. \n\nThey mentioned using operations like cutting, shifting, or reflecting paths. Classic bijection techniques in combinatorics for random walks include reflection principles, cyclic shifts, or other transformations that adjust the path to meet certain conditions.\n\nFor the first bijection (P_{2n} ↔ N_{2n-1}), maybe a mapping that shortens the path by one step? Since P has 2n steps and N has 2n-1. Perhaps the first step must be up (since P requires staying positive), and then transforming the remaining steps into a non-negative path of length 2n-1. Maybe removing the first step? But need to ensure the bijection works.\n\nAlternatively, consider the cyclic shift method. For a positive path of length 2n, if we rotate the path so that the first time it reaches the minimum is moved to the end, this might correspond to a non-negative path of shorter length. But I need to think carefully.\n\nFor the second bijection (R_{2n} ↔ N_{2n}), since R_{2n} are paths returning to 0, and N_{2n} are non-negative paths. The user mentions that the minimum value k in R_{2n} corresponds to terminal value 2k in N_{2n}. So if a path in R_{2n} has a minimum of -k, then shifting it up by k would make it non-negative, ending at k. Wait, but the user says terminal value 2k. Hmm.\n\nWait, the user says \"minimum value k\", but in R_{2n} the path starts at 0 and ends at 0. The minimum value would be some negative number, say -k, so shifting up by k would make all points ≥ 0, ending at k. But the user says the terminal value is 2k. Maybe there's a reflection involved here. Alternatively, considering the reflection at the minimum point. If the path in R_{2n} has a minimum of -k, then reflecting parts of the path after the minimum might result in a non-negative path ending at 2k. This is similar to the classical reflection principle where a path crossing a boundary is mapped to a path ending at a certain point.\n\nBut the user wants a bijection between R_{2n} and N_{2n}. So each path in R_{2n} (which can dip below zero) corresponds to a path in N_{2n} (never dipping below zero). The correspondence is via adjusting the path so that its minimum is accounted for in the terminal value. For example, if the original path in R_{2n} has a minimum of -k, then shifting the entire path up by k would result in a non-negative path ending at k. But the user says terminal value 2k. Maybe the mapping is different. Perhaps when you shift the path up by k, the terminal value would be 0 + k = k, but the user mentions 2k. Maybe there's a scaling involved. Alternatively, maybe the number of steps that go below certain levels.\n\nAlternatively, consider the Viennot's bijection or the correspondence between Dyck paths and Ballot paths. Dyck paths are balanced, returning to zero, while Ballot paths stay non-negative. But in this case, the user wants to map returning paths to non-negative ones. Maybe using a transformation that \"lifts\" the path above the x-axis by reflecting parts below the minimum.\n\nAnother approach is the cyclic shift: take a path that returns to zero and has a minimum. By cyclically shifting the path so that the first step after the minimum becomes the starting point, you might get a path that stays non-negative. For example, if the original path has a minimum at position m, then shifting the path so that it starts at position m+1 and ends at position m (cyclically). However, since the path is of even length and returns to zero, this might create a path that never goes below zero. Then, the terminal point would be related to the original minimum. But I need to formalize this.\n\nSuppose in R_{2n}, the path has a minimum value of -k. If we take the part of the path from the first time it reaches -k until the end, and concatenate it with the part from the start to the first time it reaches -k, then this new path might be a non-negative path ending at 2k. Because the original path starts at 0, goes down to -k, then comes back up to 0. By cyclically shifting to start at the first minimum, the new path starts at 0 (since after the minimum, the path rises back to 0). Wait, but the shifted path would start at the first step after the minimum. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, imagine taking the path in R_{2n}, which starts at 0 and ends at 0, and has a minimum of -k. Reflect the parts of the path that are below the x-axis. But reflection is often used to show bijections in the reflection principle. For example, if a path crosses a boundary, reflecting it after the first crossing gives a correspondence. But here, we need to transform the entire path into a non-negative one.\n\nAnother thought: subtract the minimum value from the entire path. If the original path in R_{2n} has minimum value -k, then adding k to every step would result in a path that never goes below 0, and ends at k. But the user says the terminal value should be 2k. So maybe after shifting up by k, the terminal value is k. Not matching the user's statement. But the user wrote: \"a path in R_{2n} with minimum value k corresponds to a path in N_{2n} with terminal value 2k\". Wait, if the original path in R_{2n} has minimum value k, but since it's a returning path starting and ending at 0, the minimum cannot be positive. So perhaps the user made a typo, and the minimum is actually -k, and then after some transformation, the terminal value is 2k. Let me check the original question again.\n\nOriginal question says: \"a path in R_{2n} with minimum value k corresponds to a path in N_{2n} with terminal value 2k\". Wait, but if the path is in R_{2n}, which returns to 0 at step 2n, then the minimum value k must be ≤ 0. But the user says \"minimum value k\", so maybe k is a non-positive integer. Then shifting up by |k| would result in a path ending at |k|. But the user says terminal value 2k. If k is negative, say k = -m, then 2k = -2m, but the terminal value in N_{2n} should be non-negative. So perhaps there's a misstatement here. Alternatively, maybe the minimum is the absolute value, but the problem statement needs clarification.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correspondence is that the absolute value of the minimum in R_{2n} is k, and the terminal value in N_{2n} is 2k. Then shifting up by k would result in a path ending at k. But again, 2k is different. Maybe there's a step involved where after shifting, we double some component. Alternatively, when reflecting parts of the path, the final displacement is doubled.\n\nAlternatively, consider the following: Take a path in R_{2n} that has a minimum of -k. Then, reflect all the segments of the path after the first time it reaches -k. This is similar to the reflection principle used in the Ballot theorem. By reflecting the part after the first minimum, you might get a path that ends at 2k. Let me visualize this.\n\nSuppose the original path goes from 0 to -k, then back to 0. If you reflect the part after the first time it hits -k (i.e., invert the steps from there), then the reflected path would go from 0 to -k, then instead of going back up to 0, it continues down to -2k. But that's not helpful. Alternatively, if after reaching the minimum, you reflect the path across the horizontal line y = -k, then the path would stay above y = -k. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider cutting the path at the first time it reaches the minimum. Then, take the remaining part of the path (from the minimum to the end) and move it to the beginning. Since the original path ends at 0, the part after the minimum would go from -k back to 0. If we move this part to the beginning, the new path starts at -k, then follows the original beginning up to the minimum. But this seems to complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, using a cyclic shift. If the original path is a loop (since it starts and ends at 0), cyclically shifting the path so that the first step after the minimum becomes the new starting point. This might result in a path that never goes below 0. For example, suppose the original path has a minimum at position m. Then, shifting the path so that it starts at position m+1 would create a new path. Since the original path from m to 2n goes from -k back to 0, and the original path from 0 to m goes from 0 to -k. By starting at m+1, the new path starts at S_{m+1}, which is either -k +1 or -k -1 (since it's a simple random walk). Wait, but in a simple random walk, each step is ±1. So if the minimum is at position m, S_m = -k. Then, step m+1 would be either -k +1 or -k -1. But since the path comes back to 0, after the minimum, it must eventually reach 0. So maybe the part after the minimum is a path from -k to 0 in 2n - m steps. If we shift cyclically, the new path would be from m+1 to 2n, then from 0 to m. But how does this help? If the original path had a minimum at m, then the part after m is a path from -k to 0. The part before m is a path from 0 to -k. By concatenating the part after m (from -k to 0) with the part before m (from 0 to -k), the new path would start at -k, go to 0, then go back to -k. That doesn't seem to stay non-negative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we need to reverse the path. If we reverse the path after the minimum, but that might not necessarily make it non-negative.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let's step back. The key idea the user mentioned is that a bijection exists using cutting, shifting, or reflecting. They want to map paths in R_{2n} to N_{2n} such that the minimum in R corresponds to twice that in N's terminal.\n\nMaybe the standard bijection used in the reflection principle for the Ballot problem. For example, in the Ballot theorem, the number of paths that stay above zero and end at a certain point can be related to paths that cross a boundary. But how?\n\nAlternatively, consider the following bijection from R_{2n} to N_{2n}: For a path in R_{2n} (returning to 0), subtract its minimum value from all positions. This shifts the entire path up so that the minimum becomes 0. Since the original path ends at 0, the shifted path ends at 0 - min. If the original minimum was -k, the new path ends at k. But the user wants it to end at 2k. So this approach gives a terminal value of k, not 2k. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if we take the path in R_{2n} and reflect it across the x-axis after the first time it reaches the minimum. Wait, but reflecting would invert the steps. So after the first minimum, every up step becomes a down step and vice versa. This might create a path that ends at a different point. Suppose the original path ends at 0, and after reflecting after the first minimum, which was at -k, the reflected part would go from -k to some value. If the original path after the minimum went from -k to 0, then reflecting those steps would turn the upward steps into downward steps, so the reflected path would go from -k to -2k. Then the entire path would start at 0, go to -k, then go to -2k. But this doesn't end at 0. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the difference between the terminal value in N_{2n} is twice the minimum of the original path. If the minimum is -k, then the terminal value is 2k. How to achieve that?\n\nWait, maybe using a bijection where each down step in the original path is converted to an up step in the transformed path. But that might not preserve the properties. Alternatively, take the path in R_{2n} and for each step, if it goes below the minimum, adjust it accordingly. This is vague.\n\nAnother approach: the user mentions that probability might not matter here, so it's purely combinatorial. The sets are defined by certain conditions on the paths. The bijection likely involves a transformation that adjusts the path to meet the non-negativity condition.\n\nLet me recall that in combinatorics, there's a bijection between Dyck paths (which are paths from (0,0) to (2n,0) never dipping below zero) and paths from (0,0) to (2n-1,1) staying non-negative, which uses a \"heightening\" of the path. But I need to check.\n\nAlternatively, consider the mapping between P_{2n} and N_{2n-1}. Since P_{2n} are paths that stay strictly positive for 2n steps, starting at 0 and ending at some positive point. If we remove the first step (which must be +1), then the remaining path has 2n-1 steps, starts at 1, and never goes below 1. Shifting it down by 1 gives a path that starts at 0 and never goes below 0, i.e., a path in N_{2n-1}. This might work. So the bijection is: for a path in P_{2n}, remove the first step (+1), then subtract 1 from each y-coordinate. This gives a path in N_{2n-1}. Conversely, given a path in N_{2n-1}, add 1 to each y-coordinate and prepend a +1 step. This would give a path in P_{2n}. This seems plausible. Let's verify. If the original path in P_{2n} starts with +1, so S_1=1, and remains >0. Removing the first step gives a path of length 2n-1 starting at 1. Shifting down by 1, the new path starts at 0 and never goes below 0. Conversely, any path in N_{2n-1} starts at 0 and stays ≥0. Adding 1 to each y-coordinate makes it start at 1 and stay ≥1. Prepending a +1 step (which is necessary since the original path starts at 0, but after adding 1, it starts at 1, but to make the full path start at 0, you need to add a step from 0 to 1). This seems correct. So this would be the bijection between P_{2n} and N_{2n-1}.\n\nFor the second bijection between R_{2n} and N_{2n}, the user wants a correspondence where the minimum in R is related to the terminal in N. Let's think about the cyclic shift method. For a path in R_{2n}, which starts and ends at 0, consider all cyclic shifts of the path. Each cyclic shift will start at a different point but maintain the same step sequence. For such a path, there exists a unique cyclic shift that results in a path staying non-negative. This is similar to the cycle lemma used in combinatorics. For example, consider a path with a minimum value of -k. By cyclically shifting the path so that it starts at the first step after the minimum, you might obtain a path that never goes below 0. The terminal value of this new path would then be related to the original minimum.\n\nSuppose the original path in R_{2n} has a minimum of -k. If we rotate the path so that it starts at the first step after the minimum, then the new path will start at -k +1 or -k -1. Wait, but after the minimum, the next step must be +1 (since otherwise, it would go lower than -k, contradicting that -k is the minimum). So after the minimum at position m, step m+1 is +1, taking the path to -k +1. Then, the remaining path from m+1 to 2n brings it back to 0. If we cyclically shift the path to start at m+1, the new path starts at -k +1 and ends at 0, then continues with the original path from 0 to m, which goes down to -k. But this new path would dip below zero when it reaches -k again. Hmm, this doesn't seem to work.\n\nAlternatively, the cyclic shift should be such that the new path never goes below zero. This requires that the shifted path's minimum is at least 0. The cycle lemma states that for a sequence of ±1 steps with a total sum of 0, there's exactly one cyclic shift that stays non-negative. So applying the cycle lemma here, each path in R_{2n} corresponds to exactly one cyclic shift in N_{2n}. Since there are Catalan number of Dyck paths, but here we're dealing with all returning paths, which are counted by the central binomial coefficients divided by n+1 or something. Wait, maybe this is the correct approach. The cycle lemma says that for any sequence of n +1's and n -1's that sum to 0, there is exactly one cyclic shift that stays non-negative. Thus, the number of such cyclic shifts is equal to the number of Dyck paths, which is the Catalan number. But in our case, R_{2n} includes all paths that return to 0, not just Dyck paths. Wait, no: R_{2n} is all paths of length 2n that start and end at 0, regardless of their intermediate steps. The number of such paths is C(2n, n). The number of Dyck paths (which never dip below 0) is the Catalan number C_n = (1/(n+1))C(2n, n). So the cycle lemma would say that each of the C(2n, n) paths has exactly one cyclic shift that is a Dyck path. But this seems to relate to the mapping from R_{2n} to Dyck paths, but the user wants a bijection between R_{2n} and N_{2n}, where N_{2n} is all paths of length 2n that stay non-negative. But N_{2n} is a larger set than Dyck paths, because Dyck paths end at 0, while N_{2n} can end anywhere ≥0. Wait, no: N_{2n} consists of paths of length 2n that stay ≥0, but they can end at any even integer. The number of such paths is the same as the number of paths in R_{2n} with certain properties?\n\nAlternatively, the bijection might involve taking a path in R_{2n} and shifting it such that the minimum is lifted to zero, thereby making it a non-negative path. If the original path has a minimum of -k, then adding k to each step results in a non-negative path ending at k. However, the user wants the terminal value to be 2k. This discrepancy suggests there's a different transformation. Maybe reflecting certain parts of the path.\n\nAlternatively, consider that in the path in R_{2n}, each time it dips below zero, we reflect those segments. Suppose the path has a minimum of -k. If we split the path at the first time it reaches each new minimum and reflect those parts, we might construct a non-negative path. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother angle: the user mentions that in R_{2n}, the minimum value is k, and the corresponding path in N_{2n} ends at 2k. If we consider the area under the path or other characteristics, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, think of the path as composed of excursions. Each time it returns to zero, it could be split into segments. But I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to structure the problem according to the user's format, I think I should focus on extracting the assumptions and the problem from the original question, filtering out the extra details.\n\nOriginal question states:\n- All paths start at the origin.\n- R_n: paths where S_n=0.\n- P_n: paths where S_i > 0 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.\n- N_n: paths where S_i ≥ 0 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.\n- Need to show bijections between P_{2n} and N_{2n-1}, and between R_{2n} and N_{2n}.\n- Additionally, a path in R_{2n} with minimum value k corresponds to a path in N_{2n} with terminal value 2k.\n\nAssumptions to list:\n- All paths start at the origin.\n- For P_{2n}, each i in {1, ..., 2n} has S_i > 0.\n- For N_{2n-1}, each i in {1, ..., 2n-1} has S_i ≥ 0.\n- For R_{2n}, S_{2n} = 0.\n- For the correspondence between R_{2n} and N_{2n}, the minimum value k in R_{2n} corresponds to terminal value 2k in N_{2n}.\n- Paths are represented as polygonal lines from (k-1, S_{k-1}) to (k, S_k).\n\nWait, but in the original problem statement, the user says \"Assume that all random walk paths start at the origin.\" So that's one assumption. Then, the definitions of the sets P_n, N_n, R_n. Each set has its own condition. The problem is to show the bijections. The user also mentions that the correspondence involves paths in R_{2n} with minimum value k corresponding to paths in N_{2n} with terminal value 2k.\n\nSo structuring the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object.\n\nAssumption:\n- All random walk paths start at the origin.\n- For each path in $P_{2n}$, $S_i > 0$ for all $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 2n\\}$.\n- For each path in $N_{2n-1}$, $S_i \\geq 0$ for all $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 2n-1\\}$.\n- For each path in $R_{2n}$, $S_{2n} = 0$.\n- For each path in $N_{2n}$, $S_i \\geq 0$ for all $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 2n\\}$.\n- A path in $R_{2n}$ with minimum value $k$ corresponds to a path in $N_{2n}$ with terminal value $2k$.\n\nProblem:\nShow that there is a bijection between $P_{2n}$ and $N_{2n-1}$, and a bijection between $R_{2n}$ and $N_{2n}$.\n\nBut wait, the original problem statement also includes the part about the correspondence between the minimum value and terminal value. Should that be part of the problem or an additional part to show?\n\nThe user wrote: \"Basically I want to show that a path in $R_{2n}$ with minimum value $k$ corresponds to a path in $N_{2n}$ with terminal value $2k$. For this I'm thinking about cutting or shifting or reflecting paths.\"\n\nSo the main problem is to show the two bijections, and in particular, the correspondence between R_{2n} paths and N_{2n} paths with the terminal value relation. But in the example given by the user, the problem part was concise. So perhaps the problem is to show the bijections, and the correspondence between minimum and terminal value is part of the problem statement.\n\nThus, structuring the problem part as: Show that there is a bijection between $P_{2n}$ and $N_{2n-1}$, and a bijection between $R_{2n}$ and $N_{2n}$, where a path in $R_{2n}$ with minimum value $k$ corresponds to a path in $N_{2n}$ with terminal value $2k$.\n\nBut the user's original problem mentions both bijections and the specific correspondence. So the problem should include both.\n\nBut in the example provided by the user, the formatted problem was just the problem statement without additional conditions. However, in this case, the problem has multiple parts. The user's example had a problem statement: \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91.\"\n\nIn the current case, the problem is to show two bijections and a specific correspondence. However, the user's instruction says to \"structure that problem as the following format\" with Assumption and Problem parts. So perhaps the specific correspondence is part of the problem statement.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n- All random walk paths start at the origin.\n- For each path in $P_{2n}$, $S_i > 0$ for all $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 2n\\}$.\n- For each path in $N_{2n-1}$, $S_i \\geq 0$ for all $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 2n-1\\}$.\n- For each path in $R_{2n}$, $S_{2n} = 0$.\n- For each path in $N_{2n}$, $S_i \\geq 0$ for all $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 2n\\}$.\n\nProblem:\nShow that there is a bijection between $P_{2n}$ and $N_{2n-1}$, and a bijection between $R_{2n}$ and $N_{2n}$, where a path in $R_{2n}$ with minimum value $k$ corresponds to a path in $N_{2n}$ with terminal value $2k$.\n\nBut the assumption list should include each condition applied to one object. The correspondence between minimum value and terminal value is part of the problem, not an assumption. So the assumptions are the definitions of each set and the starting condition.\n\nSo revised:\n\nAssumption:\n- All random walk paths start at the origin.\n- Each path in $P_{2n}$ satisfies $S_i > 0$ for all $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 2n\\}$.\n- Each path in $N_{2n-1}$ satisfies $S_i \\geq 0$ for all $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 2n-1\\}$.\n- Each path in $R_{2n}$ satisfies $S_{2n} = 0$.\n- Each path in $N_{2n}$ satisfies $S_i \\geq 0$ for all $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 2n\\}$.\n\nProblem:\nShow that there is a bijection between $P_{2n}$ and $N_{2n-1}$, and a bijection between $R_{2n}$ and $N_{2n}$, where a path in $R_{2n}$ with minimum value $k$ corresponds to a path in $N_{2n}$ with terminal value $2k$.\n\nThis seems to capture the necessary elements.",
