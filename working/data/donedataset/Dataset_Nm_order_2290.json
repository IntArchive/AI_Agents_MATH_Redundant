    "Content": "I am trying to derive the LU decomposition time complexity for an $n \\times n$ matrix. Eliminating the first column will require $n$ additions and $n$ multiplications for $n-1$ rows. Therefore, the number of operations for the first column is $2n(n-1)$. For the second column, we have $n-1$ additions and $n-1$ multiplications, and we do this for $(n-2)$ rows giving us $2(n-1)(n-2)$. Therefore, the total number of operations required for the full decomposition can be written as $$\n\\sum_i^n 2(n-i) (n-i+1)\n$$ How do we get from this sum to a total cost of $\\frac{2}{3}n^3$?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "An easy transformation ($j = n-i+1$) easily shows that\n\\begin{align}\n\\sum_{i=1}^n 2(n-i) (n-i+1) &= 2 \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}j(j+1)\\\\\n                            &= 2 \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}(j^2+j)\\\\\n                            &= 2 \\left(\\frac{1}{3} n^{3} - \\frac{1}{3} n\\right)\n\\end{align} Then, since we are interested only in the asymptotic behaviour, we drop the $\\frac{2}{3}n$ part, and what's left is $\\frac{2}{3} n^{3}$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So the user is asking about deriving the time complexity of LU decomposition, specifically how the sum they provided simplifies to (2/3)n³. \n\nFirst, let me recall what LU decomposition involves. It's about factorizing a matrix into lower and upper triangular matrices. The process typically uses Gaussian elimination. The key part here is understanding the operations involved in eliminating each column.\n\nThe user mentioned that for the first column, you have n additions and n multiplications for each of the n-1 rows. So that's 2n operations per row, times (n-1) rows, giving 2n(n-1). Then for the second column, it's similar but one dimension smaller: 2(n-1)(n-2), and so on. The total sum becomes the sum from i=1 to n of 2(n-i)(n-i+1). Wait, actually, the summation index isn't specified in the original problem. Let me check.\n\nThe original sum is written as the sum from i^n of 2(n-i)(n-i+1). Hmm, maybe the index is i going from 1 to n-1? Because when i=1, it's 2(n-1)(n), which matches the first term they mentioned for the first column. Then i=2 would be 2(n-2)(n-1), which is the second term. So maybe the sum is from i=1 to n-1? Or perhaps they used a different index. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, if we change variables. Let k = n - i. When i starts at 1, k goes from n-1 down to... Wait, perhaps the sum is better expressed by reversing the index. Let's see. If we let k = n - i + 1, then when i=1, k = n. Wait, this might not be necessary. Let's try to reindex the sum.\n\nThe sum given is Sum_{i=1 to n} 2(n - i)(n - i + 1). Wait, if i goes from 1 to n, then when i=1, we have 2(n-1)(n), when i=2, 2(n-2)(n-1+1)=2(n-2)(n-1+1)=2(n-2)(n)? Wait, that doesn't seem to match the user's description. Wait, maybe there's a confusion in the indexing here.\n\nWait, the user's original calculation: first column (i=1) gives 2n(n-1), second column (i=2) gives 2(n-1)(n-2), etc. So actually, the general term for column j is 2(n - j + 1)(n - j). So if we sum over j from 1 to n-1, because the first column is j=1, and the last column (n-1)th, since in an n x n matrix, you need n-1 eliminations. So the sum would be Sum_{j=1 to n-1} 2(n - j + 1)(n - j). \n\nBut in the problem, the user wrote the sum as Sum_i^n 2(n - i)(n - i + 1). Maybe they have a different index. Let's suppose that in their sum, i starts at 1 and goes up to n, but when i exceeds n-1, the terms become zero? Wait, no. If i goes up to n, then when i = n, it's 2(n - n)(n - n +1) = 2*0*1 = 0. So effectively, the sum is from i=1 to n-1. So perhaps the user's sum is written with upper limit n, but actually, the terms beyond i=n-1 are zero. So the sum is effectively Sum_{i=1}^{n-1} 2(n - i)(n - i + 1). \n\nTo compute this sum, we can make a substitution. Let k = n - i. When i=1, k = n -1. When i = n -1, k =1. And when i =n, k=0, but that term is zero. So changing variables, let k = n -i. Then the sum becomes Sum_{k=1}^{n-1} 2k(k +1). Wait, no. Wait, if k = n - i, then when i=1, k =n -1; when i=2, k =n -2; ... when i = n -1, k =1. So the sum is from k=1 to k=n-1, but in reverse order. So Sum_{k=1}^{n-1} 2k(k +1). But since addition is commutative, the order doesn't matter. Therefore, the sum is equal to 2 Sum_{k=1}^{n-1} k(k +1).\n\nNow, expand k(k +1) = k² +k. So the sum becomes 2 [Sum_{k=1}^{n-1} k² + Sum_{k=1}^{n-1} k]. We know that Sum_{k=1}^m k = m(m+1)/2 and Sum_{k=1}^m k² = m(m+1)(2m+1)/6. So substituting m =n -1:\n\nSum_{k=1}^{n-1} k = (n -1)n /2\n\nSum_{k=1}^{n-1} k² = (n -1)n(2n -1)/6\n\nTherefore, the total sum is 2 [ (n-1)n(2n -1)/6 + (n -1)n /2 ]\n\nFactor out (n -1)n /2:\n\n= 2 * (n -1)n /2 [ (2n -1)/3 + 1 ]\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n(2n -1)/3 + 1 = (2n -1 +3)/3 = (2n +2)/3 = 2(n +1)/3\n\nTherefore, the total sum becomes:\n\n2 * (n -1)n /2 * 2(n +1)/3 = (n -1)n * 2(n +1)/3\n\n= 2(n -1)n(n +1)/3\n\nWhich simplifies to 2(n³ -n)/3. Because (n -1)(n)(n +1) = n(n² -1) =n³ -n.\n\nThus, 2(n³ -n)/3. For large n, the dominant term is (2/3)n³, which is why the time complexity is approximated as (2/3)n³.\n\nTherefore, the sum simplifies to (2/3)n³ - (2/3)n, but for asymptotic time complexity, the lower order term (2/3)n is neglected, resulting in O(n³) with a leading coefficient of 2/3.\n\nSo the key steps were recognizing the sum as a sum of quadratic terms, expanding, applying known summation formulas, and simplifying to reach the cubic term.",
