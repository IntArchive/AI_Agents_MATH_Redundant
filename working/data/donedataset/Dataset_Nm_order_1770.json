    "Content": "This is a question from the book Methods of Real Analysis by R. R. Goldberg. If $(s_n)$ is a sequence of real numbers and if $$\\sigma_n=\\frac{s_1+s_2+\\cdots+s_n}{n}$$ then prove that: $\\operatorname{{lim sup}}\\sigma_n \\leq \\operatorname{lim sup} s_n$.

    "AcceptedAnswer": "Fix an integer $k$ . Let $n\\geqslant k$ . Then $$\\sigma_n=\\frac 1n\\sum_{j=1}^ks_j+\\frac 1n\\sum_{j=k+1}^ns_j\\leqslant \\frac 1n\\sum_{j=1}^ks_j+\\frac{n-k}n\\sup_{l\\geqslant k}s_l.$$ Now take on both sides the limsup when $\\color{red}{n\\to +\\infty}$ : we get the wanted result. Taking $s_n:=(-1)^n$ , we can see that the inequality may not be an equality.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual mathematics professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object. Then the problem is restated concisely.\n\nLooking at the problem from Math Stack Exchange: The title is about proving that the lim sup of the average of a sequence is less than or equal to the lim sup of the sequence itself. The question body mentions the sequence (s_n) and defines σ_n as the average of the first n terms. The goal is to prove lim sup σ_n ≤ lim sup s_n.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that (s_n) is a sequence of real numbers. Then σ_n is defined as the average of the first n terms. The problem is to prove the inequality involving lim sup.\n\nSo the assumptions should be:\n\n1. (s_n) is a sequence of real numbers.\n2. σ_n is defined as (s_1 + s_2 + ... + s_n)/n for each n.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The original problem doesn't mention any additional conditions like convergence or boundedness, so those shouldn't be included. The example given in the user's instruction didn't include extra conditions unless specified, so I should stick to what's given.\n\nWait, the original problem in the example had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the problem as stated, the user later corrected it by removing that assumption. Hmm, maybe the example was a corrected version. So in this case, the problem doesn't have any hidden assumptions beyond what's stated. The user just needs to list the given conditions.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- (s_n) is a sequence of real numbers.\n- For each n, σ_n is the average of the first n terms of (s_n).\n\nThen the problem is to prove that lim sup σ_n ≤ lim sup s_n.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is a single line, each about one object or condition. The sequence (s_n) is one object, and σ_n's definition is another. That should cover it. There's no mention of convergence, so lim sup is taken as is. The problem is to show the inequality between the lim sups. So the formatted problem should have those two assumptions and the problem statement as given.",
