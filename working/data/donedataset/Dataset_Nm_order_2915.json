    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. First, I need to parse the original question and extract the necessary information. The user wants me to act as a math professor who can filter out unrelated information and structure the problem with assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the key steps were identifying the assumptions and the problem. The original problem here is about proving a trigonometric identity involving a product of tangents equal to either sqrt(n) or 1 depending on whether n is odd or even.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. Each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. The problem involves an integer n, and the product is taken up to floor((n-1)/2). The cases are separated based on n being odd or even. So the assumptions would include that n is an integer, and then separate conditions for when it's odd or even. Wait, but in the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem already splits into cases for n odd and even, so maybe the assumptions don't need to specify that n is odd or even, since the problem statement itself covers both cases. Wait, no. Wait, the original problem's assumption in the example included that n is divisible by 7, but in the problem statement, it was stated for every integer n, but the formatted problem added the divisibility by 7. Wait, maybe the example was a mistake? Wait, looking back: the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But in the formatted problem, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be a mistake in the example. But perhaps that's how the user wants it. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the example. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instructions here.\n\nBut in the current problem, the trigonometric identity is given with cases for n odd and even. So perhaps the assumptions would be that n is an integer, and then separate conditions. Wait, but the problem statement already includes the cases for n odd and even, so maybe the assumptions don't need to repeat that. Wait, the example had the assumption of n being divisible by 7 even though the original problem didn't mention that. Wait, perhaps in the example, the user included an assumption that was part of the problem but not explicitly stated? Wait, looking at the original example: the original problem was to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, the assumption is that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that's conflicting. Because if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", then the assumption that n is divisible by 7 would restrict it. That seems like an error. Maybe the example is incorrect, but perhaps the user intended to extract the necessary conditions. Wait, perhaps the user in the example made a mistake, but regardless, I need to follow the current problem.\n\nSo for the current problem, the original question states the identity where the product equals sqrt(n) if n is odd and 1 if n is even. The product is taken from k=1 to floor((n-1)/2) of tan(kπ/n). The problem is to prove that identity.\n\nSo the assumptions here would be that n is an integer, and the problem splits into two cases: n odd and n even. However, according to the example, the assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- n is an integer.\n\nBut since the problem statement already includes the cases for n odd and even, maybe the assumptions don't need to include those. Wait, but in the example, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem didn't state it. Wait, that's confusing. Maybe in the example, the user made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the example's original problem had a hidden assumption. But regardless, the user's instruction is to list the assumptions, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nIn this problem, the key elements are that n is an integer, and the product is over k from 1 to floor((n-1)/2). The problem's result depends on whether n is odd or even. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- n is an integer greater than or equal to 3 (since floor((n-1)/2) would be at least 1 when n >=3). Wait, but the problem might not specify that n is at least 3. Let me check the original problem. The original problem's product is from k=1 to floor((n-1)/2). If n=1, floor((1-1)/2)=0, so the product would be from k=1 to 0, which is empty. Similarly, n=2, floor((2-1)/2)=0. So maybe n is an integer greater than or equal to 3. But the original problem doesn't specify this. However, in mathematical contexts, such products are considered for n >=3. So perhaps that's an implicit assumption. But the user's example didn't include such assumptions. So maybe in the absence of explicit information, we just list what's given. Alternatively, the user might expect that the assumptions are only those stated in the problem. The problem says \"for n odd\" and \"for n even\", but doesn't specify n's range. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem allows n to be any integer, but when n is 1 or 2, the product is empty (since floor((n-1)/2) is 0). For n=1, the product is empty, which is 1 by convention. Then for n odd (n=1), sqrt(1)=1, which matches. For n even (n=2), the product is empty (1), which matches the case. So maybe n can be any positive integer. But the problem statement as given in the original question doesn't restrict n. Therefore, maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n\nBut the original problem's example didn't include that. Alternatively, the original problem's example included \"n is an integer\" without restrictions. So perhaps here, the assumptions are:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n\nBut the original problem may not state that. Wait, the problem is given as a product from k=1 to floor((n-1)/2). If n is 1, then floor((1-1)/2)=0, so the product is empty. For n=2, floor((2-1)/2)=0, so also empty. For n=3, floor((3-1)/2)=1, so k=1. So perhaps n can be 1, 2, 3, etc. But the problem's cases are when n is odd or even. So n=1 is odd, n=2 is even, etc. So the product for n=1 would be 1 (empty product), which matches sqrt(1)=1. For n=2, product is 1, which matches the even case. So the problem holds for all positive integers n. Therefore, the assumption is that n is a positive integer. However, the original problem didn't specify this. But to structure the problem properly, we need to list the assumptions. So:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that \n\\[\n\\prod_{k=1}^{\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n-1}{2} \\right\\rfloor} \\tan \\left( \\frac{k \\pi}{n} \\right) = \n\\begin{cases}\n\\sqrt{n} & \\text{if } n \\text{ is odd}, \\\\\n1 & \\text{if } n \\text{ is even}.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nBut in the example, the assumption included specific conditions. Here, perhaps the assumption is just that n is a positive integer, and the problem includes the cases for odd and even. Alternatively, maybe the problem's cases are part of the problem statement, not the assumptions. The example had the problem statement include the divisibility condition, but in reality, the original problem didn't have that. Wait, perhaps the example was incorrect. But regardless, I need to follow the instructions given by the user. The user's example took an original problem that said \"for every integer n\" and formatted it with an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake, but maybe the user intended to show that assumptions can include conditions not explicitly stated. But in the current problem, the original problem's identity is for any n, splitting into odd and even. Therefore, the only assumption is that n is a positive integer, and the problem statement includes the cases for odd and even. So the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that \n\\[\n\\prod_{k=1}^{\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n-1}{2} \\right\\rfloor} \\tan \\left( \\frac{k \\pi}{n} \\right) = \n\\begin{cases}\n\\sqrt{n} & \\text{if } n \\text{ is odd}, \\\\\n1 & \\text{if } n \\text{ is even}.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nBut wait, in the original problem, the user wrote the product up to floor((n-1)/2), which is correct. Also, the cases are part of the problem statement. Therefore, the assumptions are that n is a positive integer. The problem is to prove the identity with the cases. Therefore, the formatted problem should list n as a positive integer in the assumptions, and then the problem includes the cases.\n\nAnother thing to check is whether there's any other implicit assumption. For example, in the product, k starts at 1 and goes to floor((n-1)/2). For n=1, this would be floor(0/2)=0, so the product is from 1 to 0, which is empty (product of 1). For n=2, floor((2-1)/2)=0, same. For n=3, floor(1)=1, so k=1. So the product is defined for all positive integers n. Therefore, the only assumption needed is that n is a positive integer. There's no need to separately assume odd or even because the problem's cases cover that. So the answer should be structured with assumption: n is a positive integer. Problem: the equation with cases.\n\nLet me check the example again. The example's original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, the assumption included that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. But perhaps the example was a mistake. In any case, following the current problem, the correct assumptions are that n is a positive integer. So the formatted problem would be as above.",
