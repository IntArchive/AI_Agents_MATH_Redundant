From the figure, you can see that the area under the blue-curve is bounded below by the area under the red-curve from $1$ to $\\infty$. The blue-curve takes the value $\\frac1{k}$ over an interval $[k,k+1)$ The red-curve is given by $f(x) = \\frac1{x}$ where $x \\in [1,\\infty)$ The green-curve takes the value $\\frac1{k+1}$ over an interval $[k,k+1)$ The area under the blue-curve represents the sum $\\displaystyle \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac1{k}$ while the area under the red-curve is given by the integral $\\displaystyle \\int_{1}^{n+1} \\frac{dx}{x}$ while the area under the blue-curve represents the sum $\\displaystyle \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac1{k+1}$ Hence, we get $\\displaystyle \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac1{k} > \\displaystyle \\int_{1}^{n+1} \\frac{dx}{x} = \\log(n+1)$ $\\log(n+1)$ diverges as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$ and hence\n$$\\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\displaystyle \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac1{k} = + \\infty$$ By a similar argument, by comparing the areas under the red curve and the green curve, we get $$\\displaystyle \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac1{k+1} < \\displaystyle \\int_{1}^{n+1} \\frac{dx}{x} = \\log(n+1)$$ and hence we can bound $\\displaystyle \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac1{k}$ from above by $1 + \\log(n+1)$ Hence, $\\forall n$, we have $$\\log(n+1) < \\displaystyle \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac1{k} < 1 + \\log(n+1)$$ Hence, we get $0 < \\displaystyle \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac1{k} - \\log(n+1) < 1$, $\\forall n$ Hence, if $a_n = \\displaystyle \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac1{k} - \\log(n+1)$ we have that $a_n$ is a monotonically increasing sequence and is bounded. Hence, $\\displaystyle \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} a_n$ exists. This limit is denoted by $\\gamma$ and is called the Euler-Mascheroni constant. It is not had to show that $\\gamma \\in (0.5,0.6)$ by looking at the difference in the area of these graphs and summing up the area of these approximate triangles.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants to show that the harmonic series sum from n=1 to N of 1/n is between log N and 1 + log N. Hmm, I remember that the harmonic series is related to the natural logarithm through integrals. Maybe there's a way to compare the sum to an integral of 1/x. \n\nFirst, I recall that the integral of 1/x from 1 to N is log N. But how does the sum compare to the integral? Oh right, the integral from 1 to N of 1/x dx is less than the sum from n=1 to N-1 of 1/n. Wait, or is it the other way around? Let me think. Since 1/x is a decreasing function, the left Riemann sum with step 1 starting at x=1 would overestimate the integral. So each term 1/n is the height of the rectangle from n to n+1, which is greater than the integral from n to n+1 of 1/x dx. So summing from 1 to N-1, the sum would be greater than the integral from 1 to N of 1/x dx, which is log N. So that gives sum from 1 to N-1 of 1/n > log N. Therefore, sum from 1 to N of 1/n > log N + 1/N. Wait, but the problem states log N < sum. Maybe I need to adjust the bounds.\n\nAlternatively, consider comparing the sum to the integral from 1 to N+1. If I take the integral from 1 to N+1 of 1/x dx, that's log(N+1). Since 1/x is decreasing, the sum from 1 to N of 1/n is less than 1 + integral from 1 to N of 1/x dx. Because each term 1/n is less than the integral from n-1 to n of 1/x dx for n >=2, and adding 1 for the first term. So sum from 1 to N of 1/n < 1 + log N. That would give the upper bound.\n\nFor the lower bound, maybe the sum from 1 to N of 1/n is greater than log(N+1). Wait, but the problem states log N. Let me check. If we use the integral from 1 to N+1 of 1/x dx = log(N+1) and compare it to the sum from 1 to N of 1/n. Since each term 1/k is greater than the integral from k to k+1 of 1/x dx, the sum would be greater than log(N+1). But the problem wants log N. Maybe they are using a different approximation. Alternatively, maybe using the integral from 1 to N of 1/x dx = log N, and since the sum from 1 to N of 1/n is greater than that integral plus 1/N. Wait, no. Let me get this straight.\n\nLet's consider the integral test for the harmonic series. The sum from n=1 to N of 1/n is greater than the integral from 1 to N+1 of 1/x dx = log(N+1). But log(N+1) is approximately log N + log(1 + 1/N) ≈ log N + 1/N for large N, but maybe that's not helpful here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, the lower bound could be established by considering that the sum from n=1 to N of 1/n is greater than the integral from 1 to N+1 of 1/x dx. But the problem states log N, which is less than log(N+1). So maybe the user's inequality is a bit loose. Wait, perhaps there's another way. If I compare the sum starting from n=1 to N, and compare each term 1/n with the integral from n to n+1 of 1/x dx. Then sum from n=1 to N-1 of 1/n > integral from 1 to N of 1/x dx = log N. Therefore, sum from n=1 to N of 1/n > log N + 1/N. But 1/N is positive, so log N < sum. But the problem states log N < sum, which holds. But the lower bound in the problem is log N, so that's okay even if the actual lower bound is slightly higher. Maybe the problem is simplified. \n\nSo putting it all together, the upper bound is 1 + log N, and the lower bound is log N. Therefore, the inequality log N < sum < 1 + log N holds. \n\nBut wait, when N=1, sum is 1, log 1=0, so 0 <1 <1+0=1. But 1 is not less than 1. So the upper bound fails for N=1. Similarly, maybe the problem assumes N >=2? Or perhaps the upper bound is intended to be 1 + log N, but for N=1, it's equal. So maybe the problem should state N >=1, but with N=1, the upper bound is equality. Hmm. The user's problem statement says \"for harmonic series\", which typically starts at N=1, but perhaps there's a different consideration. Alternatively, maybe the inequality is for N >=1, and the upper bound is 1 + log N, which for N=1 would be 1 + 0 =1, matching the sum. Then for N=2, sum is 1 + 1/2 = 1.5, log 2 ≈0.693, 1 + log 2 ≈1.693, so 0.693 <1.5 <1.693. That works. For N=3, sum≈1.833, log3≈1.098, 1 + log3≈2.098. So yes, the inequality holds. So maybe the original problem assumes N is a positive integer, and the upper bound is 1 + log N. The problem statement doesn't specify N's range, but the example given in the formatted problem might have assumptions. \n\nLooking back at the user's example, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the formatted problem, they listed two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. However, the original problem didn't state that n must be divisible by 7; it said \"for every integer n\". So maybe the example was incorrect. But regardless, the user wants me to structure the current problem by listing assumptions line by line. \n\nIn the current problem, the user wants to show log N < sum <1 + log N. The problem doesn't specify any conditions on N, but we saw that for N=1, the upper bound is tight. So perhaps the assumptions are that N is a positive integer. But since the example formatted problem included \"n is an integer\", even if the original problem already stated \"for every integer n\", perhaps here we need to state that N is a positive integer. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nN is a positive integer.\n\nBut maybe there are more conditions. Wait, the problem is to show log N < sum <1 + log N. However, when N=1, log N=0, sum=1, so 0 <1 <1+0=1. But 1 is not less than 1. So the upper bound fails for N=1. Therefore, the inequality as stated isn't valid for N=1. Hence, the problem must have an assumption that N >=2. Alternatively, maybe the upper bound is 1 + log N, which for N=1 is 1, which equals the sum, so perhaps the inequality is non-strict on the upper bound. But the problem states \"<1 + log N\". So maybe the problem implicitly assumes N >=2. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nN is an integer,\nN is greater than or equal to 2.\n\nBut the original problem doesn't specify, so perhaps the user's problem is incorrect for N=1, but maybe they intended N to start from 2. Alternatively, perhaps the upper bound is supposed to be 1 + log N, which for N=1 is 1, matching the sum. So the problem statement might have a typo, but the user wrote the problem as is. Therefore, in structuring the problem, perhaps the assumptions are that N is a positive integer. Even if for N=1 the upper bound is equal, but the problem states strict inequality. Therefore, the problem might have an error, but since the user wants us to structure it as per the given example, perhaps we should list N being a positive integer as the assumption, and the problem as stated. Alternatively, check if there's another way to reconcile the inequality for N=1. Maybe the lower bound is log N, which for N=1 is 0 <1, which holds. The upper bound for N=1 would be 1 <1 + log 1 =1, which is not true. So the problem's inequality as stated is incorrect for N=1. Therefore, the correct assumption should be N >=2. But the original problem didn't mention this, so maybe the user made a mistake. However, as per the user's instruction, we need to structure the problem as per the given format, listing assumptions. Therefore, the necessary assumption here would be that N is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2. But the problem statement doesn't specify this. So perhaps the answer should list N as a positive integer, even though the inequality fails for N=1. Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct if we consider N=1, but the upper bound is not strict. However, the user's problem states strict inequality. Therefore, the structured problem should include the assumption that N is an integer greater than or equal to 2. But the original problem didn't state this, so maybe the user expects us to infer it. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem allows N=1, but the inequality is adjusted. Hmm. This is a bit of a problem. Alternatively, maybe the upper bound is supposed to be non-strict, but the user wrote it as strict. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct upper bound is 1 + log N for N >=1, and the lower bound is log N for N >=1. But for N=1, log 1=0, sum=1, so 0 <1 <1+0=1, which fails the upper bound. Therefore, the problem's upper bound is incorrect for N=1. Hence, the problem must have an assumption that N >=2. Therefore, in structuring the problem, we should list:\n\nAssumption:\nN is an integer,\nN is greater than or equal to 2.\n\nBut the original problem didn't state this. However, as a knowledgeable professor, I should correct the problem's assumptions to make the inequality valid. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumptions would include N being an integer >=2. However, the user's example included assumptions even when the original problem didn't state them. For instance, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that example seems incorrect. Wait, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem in the example lists assumptions as n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But that contradicts the original problem's statement. So perhaps the example is wrong. But regardless, the user wants us to follow their format, even if it's incorrect. Therefore, in the current problem, the original question says \"for harmonic series\" and wants to show the inequality. The user didn't specify any assumptions, but the example shows that assumptions can be inferred from the problem's context. Therefore, perhaps in this case, the assumption is that N is a positive integer. Even though the inequality fails for N=1, maybe that's an oversight. Alternatively, the problem might have a mistake, but we can only go by what's given. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nN is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $$\\log N < \\sum_{n=1}^{N}\\frac{1}{n} <1 + \\log N.$$\n\nBut the problem as stated fails for N=1. Therefore, the correct assumption should be N >=2, but since the original problem didn't specify, maybe the user is unaware of this edge case. Therefore, following the example's lead, even if the original problem's assumptions are incomplete, we need to list the necessary assumptions. Alternatively, the example might have been a mistake. Given that, perhaps we should list N as a positive integer, and let the problem be as stated, acknowledging that for N=1 the upper bound isn't strictly less, but maybe the problem allows equality. Alternatively, the upper bound might have a typo and should be ≤. But the user wrote it as strict inequality. Therefore, the answer should structure it as per the user's instruction, even if there's an inconsistency. Hence, the formatted problem would have assumption: N is a positive integer, and the problem as stated. The user might have to handle the N=1 case separately, but according to the problem's phrasing, perhaps it's intended for N>=1, and the upper bound is allowed to be equal for N=1. But since the inequality is strict, it's technically incorrect. However, structuring it as per the user's example, we list the assumptions explicitly.",
