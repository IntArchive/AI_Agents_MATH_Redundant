    "AcceptedAnswer": "Working in $G$, we have $1_H1_H=1_H=1_H1_G$. The first equality follows from the fact that $1_H$ is the identity of $H$ and $H$ inherits its operation from $G$. The second follows from the fact that $1_G$ is the identity of $G$. Now premultiply by $1_H^{-1}$ to obtain the result.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to figure out how to format this Math Stack Exchange question according to the user's specifications. Let me start by reading through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe title is \"Show identity of subgroup is same as identity of group,\" and the question body says: Let H be a subgroup of G. Let 1_H and 1_G be the identities of H and G, respectively. Show that 1_H = 1_G. The user's attempt is to say that since the identity of a group is unique, then 1_H must equal 1_G. They're asking if their proof is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to structure this problem into the Assumption and Problem sections as per the example. The example given for the previous problem listed assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. \n\nLooking at the subgroup problem, the assumptions would include that H is a subgroup of G. Then, the identities 1_H and 1_G exist for H and G respectively. The problem is to show that these two identities are equal.\n\nWait, but in the original example, the assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So each assumption is a single condition. For the subgroup problem, the main assumptions are:\n\n1. H is a subgroup of G.\n2. 1_H is the identity element of H.\n3. 1_G is the identity element of G.\n\nThen the problem is to show that 1_H = 1_G.\n\nBut wait, does the problem have any other hidden assumptions? For example, the fact that H is a subgroup of G already implies that H is a group under the same operation as G. Therefore, the identity in H must be the same as in G. But the question is to prove that explicitly. The user's attempt uses the uniqueness of the identity element in a group. However, in the subgroup, the identity is unique within H, but how do we know it's the same as in G? That's the crux here. The user's proof might be too brief and not considering that the subgroup's operation is the same as the group's, hence the identity must coincide.\n\nBut according to the formatting instructions, I need to list all assumptions. So, the subgroup H is part of the assumptions. The existence of identities for both H and G is also part of the assumptions. However, in group theory, a subgroup must share the same operation as the parent group, and the identity element is necessarily the same. But maybe in the problem statement, this is not explicitly given, so the user needs to be told to prove it. Therefore, the problem is correctly structured as the example.\n\nSo, applying the format:\n\nAssumption:\n- H is a subgroup of G.\n- 1_H is the identity element of H.\n- 1_G is the identity element of G.\n\nProblem:\nShow that 1_H = 1_G.\n\nBut wait, the original problem doesn't explicitly state \"1_H is the identity of H and 1_G is the identity of G\" as separate assumptions. The problem says \"Let H be a subgroup of G. Let 1_H and 1_G be the identities of H and G, respectively.\" So those are the given assumptions. Therefore, each of these can be considered individual assumptions.\n\nSo each line in the Assumption section should be a single condition. Let me check:\n\nOriginal problem statements:\n- Let H be a subgroup of G. (First assumption)\n- Let 1_H and 1_G be the identities of H and G, respectively. (This can be split into two separate assumptions: 1_H is the identity of H, and 1_G is the identity of G.)\n\nTherefore, the Assumption section would have three points? Wait, no. The first is that H is a subgroup of G. The second is that 1_H is the identity of H. The third is that 1_G is the identity of G. So yes, three separate assumptions.\n\nBut in the example given, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", which became \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, and then \"n is divisible by 7\" as another. So each assumption is a separate line. So applying that here, same thing.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- H is a subgroup of G.\n- 1_H is the identity element of H.\n- 1_G is the identity element of G.\n\nProblem:\nShow that 1_H = 1_G.\n\nBut the original problem doesn't explicitly state that 1_G is the identity of G, but in the problem statement, it's mentioned: \"Let 1_H and 1_G be the identities of H and G, respectively.\" So that is given. Therefore, the three assumptions are as above.\n\nThe user's answer attempted to use the uniqueness of the identity, but perhaps that's not sufficient. Because the uniqueness is within the group. For example, in G, the identity is unique, but in H, the identity is unique within H. However, since H is a subgroup, it must inherit the same identity as G. Therefore, the proof requires more than just stating uniqueness, but rather using the subgroup properties.\n\nBut the formatting here is not about the solution, just about structuring the problem. So the user's example formatted the problem by extracting assumptions and the problem statement. Therefore, I need to ensure that all given conditions are listed as assumptions, each on a separate line, and then the problem statement is the actual question.\n\nHence, the correct formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n- H is a subgroup of G.\n- 1_H is the identity element of H.\n- 1_G is the identity element of G.\n\nProblem:\nShow that 1_H = 1_G.\n\nI think that's accurate. Each assumption is a single condition applied to one object. The problem is then to show the equality of the identities. The user's original question includes all these elements. So this should be the correct formatted version.",
