    "Content": "Let $E(n)=\\text{expectation of }\\dfrac{\\prod_{k=1}^n\\tan x_k}{\\sum_{k=1}^n\\tan x_k}$ where $x_k$ are independent uniformly random real numbers in $\\left(0,\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$ . Is the following conjecture true: $E(n)=\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)^{2n-6}$ for $n>2$ . Context Earlier I found that $E(2)=\\left(\\frac{2}{\\pi}\\right)^2\\int_0^{\\pi/2}\\int_0^{\\pi/2}\\frac{(\\tan x_1)(\\tan x_2)}{\\tan x_1+\\tan x_2}dx_1dx_2=\\frac{2}{\\pi}$ . Naturally, I wondered if $E(n)$ has closed forms for other $n$ values. Basis of my conjecture $E(3)=\\left(\\frac{2}{\\pi}\\right)^3\\int_0^{\\pi/2}\\int_0^{\\pi/2}\\int_0^{\\pi/2}\\frac{(\\tan x_1) (\\tan x_2)(\\tan x_3)}{\\tan x_1+\\tan x_2+\\tan x_3}dx_1dx_2dx_3=0.9999996\\dots$ , according to Desmos . I guess it's actually $1$ . For $n>3$ , Desmos and Wolfram Cloud don't work, so I used Excel with about a million trials. I got: $E(4)\\approx2.480$ , whereas $\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)^{2(4)-6}\\approx2.467$ $E(5)\\approx6.047$ , whereas $\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)^{2(5)-6}\\approx6.088$ $E(6)\\approx16.794$ , whereas $\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)^{2(6)-6}\\approx15.022$ $E(7)\\approx37.495$ , whereas $\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)^{2(7)-6}\\approx37.065$ As $n$ increases, the values of $\\dfrac{\\prod_{k=1}^n\\tan x_k}{\\sum_{k=1}^n\\tan x_k}$ fluctuate more and more, so this numerical approach becomes less reliable. If my conjecture is true, I can't imagine what a proof would look like.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The conjecture is true for $n=3$ . Consider the integral $$\nI_3=\\int_{[0,\\pi/2]^3}\\frac{\\tan x_1\\tan x_2\\tan x_3}{\\tan x_1+\\tan x_2+\\tan x_3}dx_1dx_2dx_3=\\int_{[0,\\infty]^3}\\frac{xyz}{x+y+z}\\frac{dxdydz}{(1+x^2)(1+y^2)(1+z^2)}\n$$ With change of variables $x=\\tan x_1,y=\\tan x_2,z=\\tan x_3$ . Now switch to spherical coordinates. $$\nI_3=\\int_0^\\infty r^2dr\\int_0^{\\pi/2}\\sin(\\theta) d\\theta\\int_0^{\\pi/2}d\\varphi \\frac{r^2\\sin ^2(\\theta ) \\cos (\\theta ) \\sin (\\varphi ) \\cos (\\varphi )}{\\sin (\\theta ) (\\sin (\\varphi )+\\cos (\\varphi ))+\\cos (\\theta )}\\frac{1}{\\left(r^2 \\cos ^2(\\theta )+1\\right) \\left(r^2 \\sin ^2(\\theta ) \\sin ^2(\\varphi )+1\\right) \\left(r^2 \\sin ^2(\\theta ) \\cos ^2(\\varphi )+1\\right)}\n$$ The $r$ part is just rational integral, which is easily done from partial fractions $$\n\\frac2\\pi\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{r^4}{\\left(r^2 \\cos ^2(\\theta )+1\\right) \\left(r^2 \\sin ^2(\\theta ) \\sin ^2(\\varphi )+1\\right) \\left(r^2 \\sin ^2(\\theta ) \\cos ^2(\\varphi )+1\\right)}dr\\\\\n=\\frac{\\sec (\\theta )}{\\left(\\cos ^2(\\theta )-\\sin ^2(\\theta ) \\cos ^2(\\varphi )\\right) \\left(\\cos ^2(\\theta )-\\sin ^2(\\theta ) \\sin ^2(\\varphi )\\right)}+\\frac{\\csc ^5(\\theta ) \\sec (\\varphi ) \\sec (2 \\varphi )}{\\cos ^2(\\varphi )-\\cot ^2(\\theta )}-\\frac{\\csc ^5(\\theta ) \\csc (\\varphi ) \\sec (2 \\varphi )}{\\sin ^2(\\varphi )-\\cot ^2(\\theta )}\\\\\n=\\frac{\\sin (\\theta ) (\\sin (\\varphi )+\\cos (\\varphi ))+\\cos (\\theta )}{((\\sin (\\varphi )+\\cos (\\varphi )) (\\sin (\\theta ) \\cos (\\varphi )+\\cos (\\theta )) (\\sin (\\theta ) \\sin (\\varphi )+\\cos (\\theta ))) \\left(\\sin ^3(\\theta ) \\cos (\\theta ) \\sin (\\varphi ) \\cos (\\varphi )\\right)}\n$$ Plug back into $I_3$ , lots of terms cancel out, and $$\nI_3=\\frac\\pi2\\int_0^{\\pi/2}\\frac{d\\varphi}{\\sin (\\varphi )+\\cos (\\varphi )}\\int_0^{\\pi/2}\\frac{d\\theta}{ (\\sin (\\theta ) \\cos (\\varphi )+\\cos (\\theta )) (\\sin (\\theta ) \\sin (\\varphi )+\\cos (\\theta ))}\\\\\n=\\frac\\pi2\\int_0^{\\pi/2}\\frac{\\log(\\cot(\\varphi))}{\\cos(2\\varphi)}d\\varphi=\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\log t}{t^2-1}dt=\\frac{\\pi^3}8\\qquad t=\\cot(\\varphi)\n$$ The conjecture for $n=3$ is thus proved. Unfortunately, such massive cancellation fails to occur when $n=4$ , so at least this approach is not easy. Appendix For numerical evaluation, $$\nI_n=\\int_{[0,\\infty]^n}\\frac{1}{x_1+\\cdots+x_n}\\frac{x_1dx_1}{1+x_1^2}\\cdots\\frac{x_ndx_n}{1+x_n^2}=\\int_{[0,\\infty]^n}\\int_0^\\infty e^{-t(x_1+\\cdots+x_n)}dt\\frac{x_1dx_1}{1+x_1^2}\\cdots\\frac{x_ndx_n}{1+x_n^2}\\\\\n=\\int_0^\\infty\\left(\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{xe^{-xt}}{1+x^2}dx\\right)^ndt=\\int_0^\\infty\\left( \\Big(\\frac{\\pi}{2} -\\text{Si}(t)\\Big) \\sin (t)-\\text{Ci}(t) \\cos (t)\\right)^ndt\n$$ From this, it holds in high precision $$\n\\left(\\frac2\\pi\\right)^6I_4\\approx 0.95596478957\n$$ This result differs quite largely from the conjecture, so the latter is probably false. Indeed, finding a closed form is still tempting. I suspect polylogarithms could possibly appear in the result. Interesting byproducts appear along my attempt, such as $$\n\\int_0^{\\infty } \\frac{\\log (x) \\left(\\left(x^2+2\\right) \\log \\left(x^2+1\\right)-2 x \\tan ^{-1}(x)\\right)}{\\left(x^2+1\\right) \\left(x^2+4\\right)} \\, dx =\\frac{\\pi ^3}{9}\\\\\n\\int_0^{\\infty } \\frac{\\left(x^2+2\\right) \\log \\left(x^2+1\\right)-2 x \\tan ^{-1}(x)}{x \\left(x^2+1\\right) \\left(x^2+4\\right)} \\, dx =\\frac{\\pi ^2}{36}\n$$ It is invited to prove them. (The latter is easy)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The format requires listing each assumption line by line, each addressing only one property or condition of one object. Then, the problem statement itself.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question. The title says: \"Conjecture: If \\( x_k \\) are random in \\( (0,\\pi/2) \\) then expectation of \\( \\frac{\\prod_{k=1}^n\\tan x_k}{\\sum_{k=1}^n\\tan x_k} \\) is \\( (\\pi/2)^{2n-6} \\) for \\( n > 2 \\).\"\n\nThe question body starts by defining \\( E(n) \\) as the expectation of that fraction, where \\( x_k \\) are independent uniformly random in \\( (0, \\pi/2) \\). The conjecture is that \\( E(n) = (\\pi/2)^{2n - 6} \\) for \\( n > 2 \\). Then there's context about how they calculated \\( E(2) \\), \\( E(3) \\), and some numerical results for higher \\( n \\).\n\nSo, the assumptions here would be:\n\n1. \\( x_k \\) are independent random variables.\n2. Each \\( x_k \\) is uniformly distributed over the interval \\( (0, \\pi/2) \\).\n3. \\( n \\) is an integer greater than 2.\n\nEach of these is a separate condition. The first assumption is about the independence of the variables. The second is about their distribution and the interval. The third is about the value of \\( n \\).\n\nThe problem is to prove or verify the conjecture that the expectation \\( E(n) \\) equals \\( (\\pi/2)^{2n - 6} \\) under these conditions.\n\nI should check the example provided. In the example, the original problem was about divisibility by 91, and the formatted assumptions listed that \\( n \\) is an integer and that it's divisible by 7. Wait, but in the example, the user's formatted problem included an assumption that wasn't actually in the original problem. Wait, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like a mistake. Wait, the original problem is to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the example's formatted problem includes \"n is divisible by 7\", which is incorrect. Hmm, maybe that's part of the example? Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example? Wait, maybe the original problem had a different assumption. Let me check again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem states: \"Prove that for every integer \\( n \\), the number \\( A(n) = 5^n (5^n + 1) - 6^n (3^n + 2^n) \\) is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem's assumptions are: \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" That seems contradictory because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", which includes all integers, not just those divisible by 7. But the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That suggests that perhaps the example is incorrect, but maybe the user intended to filter out some conditions. Wait, perhaps the original problem was different? Or maybe there's a mistake in the example. Hmm, maybe the user intended to show that even if the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but perhaps there's a hidden assumption. However, given that 91 is 7*13, perhaps the problem requires n to be divisible by both 7 and 13? But the example's formatted problem only mentions 7. Maybe that example is a wrong example. But regardless, the user's instruction is to follow the format as per their example.\n\nSo, going back to the current problem. The original problem states that \\( x_k \\) are independent and uniformly random in \\( (0, \\pi/2) \\), and \\( n > 2 \\). So, the assumptions should be:\n\n- Each \\( x_k \\) is an independent random variable.\n- Each \\( x_k \\) is uniformly distributed on \\( (0, \\pi/2) \\).\n- \\( n \\) is an integer greater than 2.\n\nEach of these is a separate line. Then the problem is to prove that \\( E(n) = (\\pi/2)^{2n - 6} \\).\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is one property per line. So, independence is one line, uniform distribution on the interval is another, and the condition on \\( n \\) is the third.\n\nThe problem statement is the conjecture itself. So the formatted problem should list these assumptions and then the problem to prove the conjecture.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nEach \\( x_k \\) is an independent random variable,\nEach \\( x_k \\) is uniformly distributed in \\( (0, \\pi/2) \\),\n\\( n \\) is an integer greater than 2.\nProblem:\nProve that \\( E(n) = \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right)^{2n - 6} \\).\n\nThat should be the correct structure. The original problem mentions \\( n > 2 \\), so the third assumption is about \\( n \\) being an integer greater than 2. The variables being independent and uniformly distributed are separate assumptions.\n\nI need to check if the user included any other conditions, but in the problem statement, the main conditions are independence, uniform distribution on (0, π/2), and n > 2. So that's three assumptions.",
