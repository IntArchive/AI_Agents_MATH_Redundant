    "Content": "Let a real-valued function $f$ be continuous on $[0,1].$ Then there exists a number $a$ such that the integral\n$$\\int_0^1\\frac 1 {|f(x)-a|}\\, dx\n$$ diverges. How to prove that statement?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Take a nondecreasing rearrangement $r(x)$ of the function $f(x)$ (some discussion of this may be found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_conjugate ). This involves finding a measure-preserving transformation of the interval $[0,1]$ that transforms $f$ into $r$. In particular, your integrals $\\int_0^1\\frac 1 {|f(x)-a|}\\, dx$ are all preserved (for every $a$). Now apply the result that every monotone function is a.e. differentiable (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotonic_function ). Take a point $p$ where the function $r$ is differentiable.  Then $a=r(p)$ does the trick, because $r(x)-a$ can be bounded in terms of a linear expression. Note that the existence of a nondecreasing rearrangement of a function $f$ admits an elegant proof in the context of its hyperreal extension $^\\star f$, which we will continue to denote by $f$.  Namely, take an infinite hypernatural $H$ and consider a partition of the hyperreal interval $[0,1]$ into $H$ segments, by means of partition points $0, \\frac{1}{H}, \\frac{2}{H}, \\frac{3}{H}, \\ldots, \\frac{H-1}{H}, 1$.  Now rearrange the values $f(\\frac{i}{H})$ of the function at partition points in increasing order, and permute the $H$ segments accordingly.  The standard part of the resulting function is the desired monotone function $r$. Note 1.  I should point out that one does not really need to use the result that monotone functions are a.e. differentiable.  Consider the convex hull of the graph of $r(x)$, and take a point where the graph touches the boundary of the convex hull (other than the endpoints 0 and 1).  Setting $a$ equal to the $x$-coordinate of the point does the job.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to format this problem according to the given example. Let me first read the original question carefully.\n\nThe problem states: Let a real-valued function f be continuous on [0,1]. Then there exists a number a such that the integral from 0 to 1 of 1 over |f(x) - a| dx diverges. We need to prove that statement.\n\nFirst, I need to list all assumptions line by line, each addressing only one property or condition applied to one object. Let's break down the assumptions mentioned in the problem.\n\n1. The function f is real-valued. That's one assumption.\n2. The function f is continuous on the interval [0,1]. That's another assumption.\n3. The integral in question is ∫₀¹ 1/|f(x) - a| dx. The problem is about the existence of an 'a' such that this integral diverges.\n\nWait, the problem doesn't state any specific conditions on 'a' other than its existence. The assumptions are about f, not a. So the assumptions should be about f's continuity and being real-valued. Then the problem is to show there's an 'a' making the integral diverge.\n\nWait, the example given in the prompt had assumptions like \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". So each assumption is a separate line. Here, the original problem says \"Let a real-valued function f be continuous on [0,1].\" So that's two properties: real-valued and continuous. But maybe in the assumptions, they should be separate? Wait, in the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are two separate lines. So perhaps \"f is a real-valued function\" and \"f is continuous on [0,1]\" as two separate assumptions.\n\nAlso, the problem statement is \"there exists a number a such that the integral diverges\". So the problem part is to prove that such an 'a' exists.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a real-valued function,\nf is continuous on [0,1].\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a number a such that ∫₀¹ 1 / |f(x) - a| dx diverges.\n\nWait, but in the original problem statement, the integral is written as ∫₀¹ 1 / |f(x) - a| dx. The user wrote \"diverges\", so the integral is improper, but when does that happen? The integrand would need to have a singularity in [0,1], i.e., |f(x) - a| becomes zero somewhere, leading to 1/0. However, since f is continuous on [0,1], by the Intermediate Value Theorem, if a is between the minimum and maximum of f, then there exists some c in [0,1] where f(c) = a. Therefore, the integrand would have a point where it's 1/0, which would make the integral improper. The integral would then diverge if the singularity is not integrable, i.e., if near x=c, |f(x) - a| behaves like |x - c|^k where k >= 1. But since f is continuous, f(x) - a would behave like f'(c)(x - c) near c (if f is differentiable there), so |f(x) - a| ~ |x - c|, so 1/|x - c| is not integrable around c, hence the integral diverges.\n\nTherefore, the key idea is to choose a as a value taken by f on [0,1], which exists by the Extreme Value Theorem (since f is continuous on a compact interval, so it attains its min and max). Therefore, such an a exists, and the integral will diverge because of the non-integrable singularity at the point where f(x) = a.\n\nBut the problem is to structure the question, not answer it. So the assumptions are f is real-valued, continuous on [0,1], and the problem is to prove existence of a such that the integral diverges.\n\nSo the formatted version would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a real-valued function,\nf is continuous on [0,1].\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a number a such that the integral ∫₀¹ 1 / |f(x) - a| dx diverges.\n\nWait, but the original problem uses the definite article \"the integral\", so maybe we need to keep the LaTeX as in the original.\n\nOriginal LaTeX was: $$\\int_0^1\\frac 1 {|f(x)-a|}\\, dx$$\n\nSo the problem line should include that integral in LaTeX.\n\nTherefore, formatted as:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a real-valued function,\nf is continuous on [0,1].\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a number a such that the integral\n$$\\int_0^1\\frac{1}{|f(x)-a|}\\, dx$$\ndiverges.\n\nYes, that looks correct. Each assumption is a separate line, addressing one property of one object (f being real-valued, f being continuous on [0,1]). The problem is to prove the existence of a such that the integral diverges.",
