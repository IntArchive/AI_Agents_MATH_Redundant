    "Content": "In Rudin, $\\limsup$ is defined as follows: Let $S$ be the set of numbers $x$ (in the extended real number system) such that $s_{n_k}\\to x$ for some subsequence $\\{s_{n_k}\\}$ . Then $$\\limsup s_n = \\sup S. \\tag{1}$$ However, our real analysis instructor defined $\\limsup$ in a different manner: $$\\limsup s_n = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sup_{m \\ge n} s_m. \\tag{2}$$ I am having trouble understanding how these two definitions are equivalent. It would be very helpful to me if somebody could provide a proof with some explanation. My thoughts on the problem: I have noticed that the usual trend with these sort of proofs is to prove the upper bound $(1) \\le (2)$ and then the lower bound $(1) \\ge (2)$ to get the desired conclusion. However, I am unsure how to even begin.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "We first construct a sub-sequence in $S$ that has limit $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\sup_{k>n} s_k$ . We do this by observing that there's a $l(n)>n$ such that $\\sup_{k>n}s_k \\ge s_{l(n)} \\ge \\sup_{k>n}s_k-2^{-n}$ , now $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}s_{l(n)} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sup_{k>n} s_k$ . Now as $l(n)>n$ we have $l(n)\\to\\infty$ so $l(n)$ has an increasing subsequence $t_n$ and by that we can construct the desired subsequence of $s_n$ . That is we have proved that $$\\sup S \\ge \\lim t_n = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\sup_{k>n}s_k$$ To prove the opposite lets consider \"synchronized\" subsequence $u_n$ (that $u_n=s_n$ or $u_n=u_{n-1}$ - just repeating the elements in the subsequence to keep them in sync) - this kind of construct doesn't alter the definition if $S$ . Now $\\{u_k: k>n\\}\\subseteq \\{s_k: k>n\\}$ and therefore $\\sup_{k>n}u_k \\le sup_{k_n}s_k$ . This means that: $$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} u_k \\le \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\sup_{k>n}u_k \\le \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\sup_{k>n}s_k$$ That is for all subsequences in $S$ the limit is less than or equal the $\\liminf$ of definition (2) that is: $$\\sup S\\le\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\sup_{k>n}s_k$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the given question from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should list each condition applied to one object, and then the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the original question: The user is asking about the equivalence of two definitions of lim sup. The first definition from Rudin defines lim sup as the supremum of the set S of subsequential limits. The second definition is the limit of the supremum of the tail of the sequence. The user is having trouble proving these two are equivalent and wants a proof with explanation.\n\nSo, the problem is to show that these two definitions are equivalent. Now, I need to list the assumptions. The assumptions here would be about the properties each definition requires. Let's see:\n\n1. The first definition involves the set S of all subsequential limits of the sequence {s_n}. So, one assumption is that S is the set of all subsequential limits of {s_n}.\n\n2. The second definition involves taking the limit as n approaches infinity of the supremum of s_m for m ≥ n. So, another assumption is that the sequence {s_n} is a real sequence (since lim sup is defined in the extended real numbers, but maybe we need to specify that the terms are real numbers).\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user is just presenting the two definitions and asking for equivalence. So perhaps the assumptions are inherent in the definitions themselves. Let me check the example again. In the example, the assumptions listed were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. But in the problem here, the definitions are given, so the assumptions would be about the sequence {s_n} being a sequence of real numbers, and that the lim sup is defined in the extended real number system. But the user hasn't specified any particular conditions on {s_n}; the problem is general.\n\nHmm. Since the example had assumptions listed even when the problem was to prove something for all integers n (with an added condition), maybe here the assumptions would just be the definitions provided. But the example's assumptions were about the objects in the problem. Here, the problem is about equivalence of two definitions, so maybe the assumptions are that {s_n} is a sequence of real numbers, and S is the set of all subsequential limits. Wait, but S is defined in the problem statement. The problem is to show that under these definitions, (1) and (2) are equal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are no specific assumptions here other than the general context. The problem is in real analysis, so the assumptions are that {s_n} is a real sequence, and S is the set of its subsequential limits. But since the problem is about equivalence, maybe the key assumptions are the two definitions themselves.\n\nBut the example's assumption listed specific conditions on n. Here, the problem is more about definitions. So perhaps the assumptions are the two definitions given. But the format requires each assumption to address one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo breaking down:\n\nAssumption 1: For a sequence {s_n}, the set S consists of all extended real numbers x such that some subsequence {s_{n_k}} converges to x.\n\nAssumption 2: The lim sup as per definition (1) is the supremum of S.\n\nAssumption 3: The lim sup as per definition (2) is the limit as n approaches infinity of sup_{m ≥ n} s_m.\n\nBut the problem is to show these two are equal. So perhaps the assumptions are the definitions themselves. But in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7; the user added that. Wait, no, looking back at the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, the assumption included that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. That seems like a mistake. But maybe the example was a mistake, but I need to follow the user's instruction.\n\nWait, perhaps in the example, the user made a mistake. Because the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", which is an extra assumption. That seems incorrect. So maybe the example is wrong. Therefore, perhaps the user wants me to filter out unrelated information and list the actual assumptions from the problem.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user is asking about the equivalence of two definitions. The definitions are given as (1) and (2). So the assumptions would be the conditions under which these definitions are considered. So for the problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- {s_n} is a sequence of real numbers (or extended real numbers, as per Rudin's definition).\n\nBut the problem statement in the example included an assumption that n is an integer, which was part of the original problem. So perhaps here, the assumptions are about the sequence {s_n} being a sequence in the extended real numbers, and that S is the set of subsequential limits. But maybe the problem is general and doesn't have specific assumptions beyond the definitions given.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no additional assumptions beyond what's in the problem. The problem is to show equivalence of two definitions, so the assumptions would just be the context that {s_n} is a sequence in the extended real numbers. But since the problem is to prove the equivalence, maybe the key is to state that both definitions are about the same sequence {s_n} and that S is the set of its subsequential limits.\n\nBut I need to structure this as per the example. The example extracted assumptions from the problem. In the original problem, the user mentioned \"for every integer n\", so the assumption was \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" (but the latter seems added incorrectly). Wait, maybe the example is flawed, but I need to follow the user's instruction regardless.\n\nIn the current problem, the problem is to show the two definitions are equivalent. The definitions are:\n\n1. lim sup s_n = sup S, where S is the set of subsequential limits.\n\n2. lim sup s_n = lim_{n→∞} sup_{m ≥ n} s_m.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- {s_n} is a sequence in the extended real numbers.\n\n- S is the set of all subsequential limits of {s_n}.\n\n- The lim sup in definition (1) is the supremum of S.\n\n- The lim sup in definition (2) is the limit of the suprema of the tails of {s_n}.\n\nBut each assumption should be one property applied to one object. So breaking down:\n\nAssumption 1: {s_n} is a sequence of extended real numbers.\n\nAssumption 2: S is the set of all x in the extended real numbers such that some subsequence {s_{n_k}} converges to x.\n\nAssumption 3: lim sup s_n (as per definition (1)) is equal to sup S.\n\nAssumption 4: lim sup s_n (as per definition (2)) is equal to the limit as n approaches infinity of sup_{m ≥ n} s_m.\n\nBut the problem is to show that these two definitions (3 and 4) are equivalent. However, in the example, the assumptions were more about the variables involved. Maybe I need to list the definitions as assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to prove the equivalence of two definitions, the assumptions would be the conditions under which the problem is set. For instance, the sequence is in the extended reals, and S is the set of its subsequential limits.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions were about the variables (n being integer and divisible by 7). So perhaps here, the assumptions are:\n\n- {s_n} is a sequence of extended real numbers.\n\n- S is the set of subsequential limits of {s_n}.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that sup S equals the limit of sup_{m ≥ n} s_m as n approaches infinity.\n\nBut the user's problem statement says \"showing that two definitions of lim sup are equivalent\". So the problem is to prove that (1) and (2) are equal. So the assumptions would be the context in which these definitions are given.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: {s_n} is a sequence of extended real numbers,\n\nS is the set of all subsequential limits of {s_n},\n\nlim sup s_n is defined as sup S,\n\nlim sup s_n is defined as lim_{n→∞} sup_{m ≥ n} s_m.\n\nProblem: Prove that the two definitions of lim sup are equivalent.\n\nBut the example had two assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. So each assumption is a separate line. Here, each line should be a separate assumption. So:\n\nAssumption:\n\n{s_n} is a sequence in the extended real number system,\n\nS is the set of numbers x such that s_{n_k} → x for some subsequence {s_{n_k}},\n\nlim sup s_n is defined as the supremum of S,\n\nlim sup s_n is defined as the limit as n approaches infinity of sup_{m ≥ n} s_m.\n\nProblem: Show that the two definitions of lim sup are equivalent.\n\nBut the problem is to show the equivalence, so the assumptions are the two definitions. However, the example included specific conditions on n, but here the problem is about definitions. Therefore, the correct approach is to list the definitions as assumptions and then state the problem as proving their equivalence.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Each definition is an assumption about how lim sup is defined, and the problem is to show they are equivalent.\n\nSo final answer would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n{s_n} is a sequence in the extended real number system,\nS is the set of all subsequential limits of {s_n},\nDefinition (1) states that lim sup s_n = sup S,\nDefinition (2) states that lim sup s_n = lim_{n→∞} sup_{m ≥ n} s_m.\nProblem:\nShow that definitions (1) and (2) of lim sup are equivalent.\n###",
