    "Content": "When trying to show that $I+J$ is nilpotent, whenever $I,J$ are nilpotent ideals of a Lie algebra $L$, I did it brute force: By induction we can show the following: An element of $(I+J)^{2N}$ is a sum of elements of the form $[x_1,[x_2,[\\ldots,[x_{2N},x_{2N+1}]]\\ldots]$, with $x_i \\in I \\cup J$. So at least $N$ of the $x_i$ lie in $I$ or in $J$. Using induction again, one can show that this product then  lies in $I^N$ resp. $J^N$. Hence, if we choose $N$ large, it follows that $(I+J)^N = 0$. I was wondering if there is some more elegant proof. Is it maybe easier to use Engel's theorem ?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "We have $(I+J)^{2m}\\subseteq I^m+J^m$ for all $m\\ge 1$, hence $(I+J)^{2m}=0$ for $m$ large enough. I find this proof very natural, but indeed there is another proof using Engel's theorem and another two lemmas from  representation theory; so it is perhaps more elegant, but it is also more complicated. This depends on your taste, too. For the alternative proof see Lemma $5.3.3$, Lemma $5.3.4$ and Lemma $5.3.5$ here .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about proving that the sum of two nilpotent ideals in a Lie algebra is also nilpotent. The user wants me to extract the assumptions and restate the problem clearly.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions. The problem mentions two ideals, I and J, in a Lie algebra L. Both I and J are nilpotent. The goal is to show that their sum I + J is nilpotent. The original proof uses a brute force induction method, and the asker is looking for a more elegant approach, possibly using Engel's theorem.\n\nSo the assumptions here are:\n\n1. L is a Lie algebra.\n2. I is an ideal of L.\n3. J is an ideal of L.\n4. I is nilpotent.\n5. J is nilpotent.\n\nEach assumption should be a single condition applied to one object. Let me check if that's covered. The first assumption is about L being a Lie algebra. Then I and J being ideals of L, each as separate points. Then each being nilpotent. That seems to fit.\n\nThe problem statement then is to prove that the sum I + J is a nilpotent ideal. Wait, the problem might also need to note that the sum of ideals is an ideal, but maybe that's considered part of the problem's premise. The original question doesn't explicitly state that I + J is an ideal, but since I and J are ideals, their sum is automatically an ideal. However, the user might need to clarify if that's an assumption or part of the problem. But in the original problem, the user is taking I + J as an ideal and trying to show it's nilpotent. So perhaps the fact that I + J is an ideal is a known result in Lie algebras, so maybe not an assumption here. So the main assumptions are just that I and J are nilpotent ideals in L.\n\nSo compiling the assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\nL is a Lie algebra,\nI is an ideal of L,\nJ is an ideal of L,\nI is nilpotent,\nJ is nilpotent.\n\nProblem:\nProve that I + J is a nilpotent ideal.\n\nWait, the problem in the original question is about the sum of nilpotent ideals being nilpotent. The user's example included the problem statement with the mathematical expression. Here, the problem is to prove that I + J is nilpotent given that I and J are nilpotent ideals. So that should be the problem statement. The user might have structured the example with some conditions in the assumptions, like n being an integer and n divisible by 7. In this case, the assumptions are about L being a Lie algebra, I and J being ideals, and each being nilpotent. So I think that's correct.\n\nI need to ensure that each assumption is one line, one condition. Let me check again:\n\n1. L is a Lie algebra. (Single object, single condition)\n2. I is an ideal of L. (Single object, single condition)\n3. J is an ideal of L. (Same)\n4. I is nilpotent. (Single property)\n5. J is nilpotent. (Same)\n\nYes, each is a separate line addressing one condition on one object.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have these assumptions and the problem statement to prove I + J is nilpotent.",
