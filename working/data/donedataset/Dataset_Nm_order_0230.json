    "AcceptedAnswer": "First observe that the sum converges (by, say, the root test). We already know that $\\displaystyle R := \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{2^n} = 2$. Let $S$ be the given sum.  Then $\\displaystyle S = 2S - S = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{2n+1}{2^n}$. Now use the same trick to compute $\\displaystyle T := \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{n}{2^n}$:  we have $\\displaystyle T = 2T - T = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{2^n} = R = 2$.  Hence $S = 2T + R = 6$. One can continue like this to compute $\\displaystyle X:= \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{n^3}{2^n}$.  We have $\\displaystyle X = 2X-X = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{3n^2+3n+1}{2^n} = 3S+3T+R = 26$.  Sums with larger powers can be computed in the same way.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to prove that the infinite sum of n squared over 2 to the n equals 6. They mentioned trying to express it as a geometric series but got stuck with the n squared term. \n\nFirst, I remember that for standard geometric series, the sum of x^n from n=0 to infinity is 1/(1-x) when |x| < 1. But here, we have an n^2 term in the numerator. So this isn't a basic geometric series. \n\nI think the key here is to use generating functions or manipulate the series by differentiating the standard geometric series. Let's recall that the sum of n*x^n can be found by taking the derivative of the basic geometric series sum. Maybe differentiating twice would bring down an n^2 term?\n\nLet me start with S = sum_{n=0}^∞ x^n = 1/(1-x). Then the first derivative S' = sum_{n=1}^∞ n x^{n-1} = 1/(1-x)^2. Multiplying by x gives sum_{n=0}^∞ n x^n = x/(1-x)^2. \n\nTaking the derivative again, we get the sum of n^2 x^{n-1} = (1+x)/(1-x)^3. Then multiplying by x gives sum n^2 x^n = x(1+x)/(1-x)^3. \n\nIn the given problem, x is 1/2. Plugging x = 1/2 into the formula: sum n^2 (1/2)^n = (1/2)(1 + 1/2)/(1 - 1/2)^3. Let's compute that. \n\nFirst, 1 - 1/2 = 1/2, so denominator is (1/2)^3 = 1/8. The numerator is (1/2)*(3/2) = 3/4. So 3/4 divided by 1/8 is 3/4 * 8/1 = 6. That matches the desired result. \n\nBut wait, the original sum starts at n=0. However, when n=0, the term is 0^2 / 2^0 = 0, so it doesn't affect the sum. Therefore, the sum from n=0 is the same as from n=1. So using the formula starting from n=1 is valid here. \n\nTherefore, the key steps are recognizing the series as a variation of the geometric series with coefficients involving n^2, applying differentiation to derive the general formula, and then substituting x = 1/2 to compute the sum. \n\nThe assumptions here are that the series converges (which it does since the common ratio is 1/2, less than 1), and that differentiation term by term is valid, which holds within the radius of convergence. \n\nSo structuring the problem according to the user's format, the main assumption is that the series converges (which is given by the ratio 1/2), and the problem is to compute the sum. But in the example provided earlier, the assumption included specific conditions like n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is about an infinite series, so the key assumption is the convergence condition. However, since the user's example had specific mathematical conditions, perhaps here the assumption is just the convergence, or maybe the problem doesn't require additional assumptions beyond the series definition. \n\nWait, looking at the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But in the problem here, the sum is from n=0 to infinity, and each term is n^2 / 2^n. The main conditions here are that the series is infinite and the ratio is 1/2. However, in the example, the user included specific constraints. But in this case, the problem as stated doesn't have additional constraints beyond the series definition. Maybe the assumption is that the series converges? But the user's example didn't state that. Alternatively, since the problem is to compute the sum, perhaps there are no specific assumptions other than the series being defined as given. \n\nWait, the user's example had the original problem stating \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. So the user extracted specific conditions from the problem. But in this current problem, the question is to compute the sum, which doesn't have variables with conditions. The sum is fixed. So perhaps the assumption here is that the series converges. But since the problem is just to compute it, maybe there are no specific assumptions to list. However, in the example, they included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". \n\nWait, looking back: the original problem in the example was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem listed assumptions that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like a mistake. Because if the original problem is for every integer n, then the assumption shouldn't add that n is divisible by 7 unless it's part of the problem. Wait, maybe the example had a typo or misunderstanding. \n\nWait, the example's original problem states: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, the assumptions are \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" That seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", which would mean n is any integer, but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\", which restricts n. That contradicts the original problem. So perhaps there was a mistake in the example. \n\nBut given that, perhaps in the current problem, the user wants to list assumptions that are implicit. In the current problem, the series sum is from n=0 to infinity of n^2 / 2^n. The main assumption here is that the series converges, which it does because the common ratio is 1/2. So maybe the assumption is that the series converges, but in the example, the user included assumptions about the variable in the problem. However, in the current problem, there's no variable; it's a specific sum. Therefore, maybe there are no assumptions to list. But the format requires assumptions. \n\nWait, the example's formatted problem had assumptions even though the original problem was to prove for all integers n. So perhaps in the current problem, since it's a sum over n, the assumption is that n is a non-negative integer (since the sum starts at n=0), but that's part of the problem's definition. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumption is that the series converges. But in the example, the user didn't state that as an assumption. So perhaps in this case, the assumption is that the series converges, but the user might have intended to list the conditions necessary for the problem to hold. Since the sum equals 6 under the condition that the series converges, which it does for |1/2| < 1. \n\nBut since the problem is just to compute the sum, perhaps there are no additional assumptions beyond the series being defined as given. However, the example included two assumptions even though the original problem was for all integers n, which might mean that the user wants to list the domain of n. In this case, n is a non-negative integer (since the sum starts at 0). So maybe the assumption is that n is a non-negative integer. \n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to compute the sum, and the sum is over all n from 0 to infinity, the key assumptions would be related to convergence. But since the user's example included specific conditions on n (even though conflicting), perhaps here the assumption is that the sum converges. But I need to follow the format as per the example, even if the example seems contradictory. \n\nAlternatively, maybe in this problem, there are no specific assumptions, but the format requires listing assumptions. So perhaps the assumption is that the series is convergent. Let me check the example again. \n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. \n\nWait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\", which is not in the original. That seems like a mistake. So perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user provided it as a reference. So maybe the user wants to extract any conditions or properties from the problem. \n\nIn the current problem, the sum is from n=0 to infinity of n^2 / 2^n. The problem is to show it equals 6. The only assumption here is that the series converges, which it does because the ratio is 1/2. But perhaps the user wants to list that assumption. However, in the example, they listed assumptions about n (even though conflicting). \n\nAlternatively, maybe since the problem is a summation, the key assumption is that n is an integer, which is part of the summation index. So in this case, the assumption would be that n is an integer. But in the example, they listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So perhaps here, the assumption is that n is an integer. But in the summation, n is the index variable, so it's inherently an integer. \n\nWait, in the example, the original problem was about A(n) for every integer n, so n was a variable. In the current problem, the sum is over n, which is a dummy variable. So perhaps there's no variable here, so no assumptions. But the format requires assumptions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects to list the convergence as an assumption. For example:\n\nAssumption: \nThe series $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{n^2}{2^n}$ converges.\n\nProblem: \nProve that $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{n^2}{2^n} = 6$.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about the variable in the problem (n being integer and divisible by 7). In this case, there's no variable, just a sum. So maybe the user's intended format is to list any conditions that are necessary for the problem to hold. Here, convergence is necessary, so that's an assumption. \n\nAlternatively, the problem as stated is to compute the sum, and the sum does converge to 6. So the assumption is that the series converges. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumption would be that the series converges. \n\nBut to check, let's look at the example again. The original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted assumptions were \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which includes all integers, but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\", which is a mistake. So perhaps the example has an error, and the user intended to extract the necessary conditions from the problem. \n\nGiven that confusion, perhaps in the current problem, since it's a summation, the assumption is that the series is convergent, which is implied by the ratio test (since 1/2 < 1). However, in the example, the user included assumptions even if they were part of the problem's original statement. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to list the mathematical objects involved. In this problem, the key object is the series itself. The assumptions would be that the series is defined for n starting at 0, each term is n^2 / 2^n, etc. But that's part of the problem statement. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no specific assumptions beyond the problem's definition, so the assumption section is empty. But the example included assumptions even when they were part of the problem's premise. \n\nGiven the confusion from the example, but following the user's instruction to structure the problem as per the example, perhaps in this case, the assumption is that n is a non-negative integer, as the summation index starts at 0. \n\nBut in the example, the original problem's assumption was \"n is an integer\", which is already part of the problem's statement. So perhaps here, the assumption is that n is a non-negative integer. However, the summation from n=0 to infinity inherently assumes n is an integer, but in real analysis, sometimes n is treated as a continuous variable. But in series like this, n is an integer. \n\nSo, structuring it according to the example, the assumption would be:\n\nAssumption: \nn is a non-negative integer.\n\nProblem: \nProve that $$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{n^2}{2^n} = 6$$.\n\nBut the example had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Here, perhaps since the problem is about a sum over n, and n is the summation index, the assumption is that n is an integer. But the summation index is always an integer, so maybe that's redundant. \n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to compute the sum, and the sum converges, the key assumption is convergence. But the example didn't mention convergence. \n\nGiven the ambiguity in the example, but trying to follow the format, perhaps the best way is to list the necessary assumptions for the problem to hold. Here, the problem holds because the series converges, which is true when |1/2| < 1. So the assumption is that the common ratio is 1/2, which is less than 1, ensuring convergence. But the problem as stated doesn't mention proving convergence, just computing the sum. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no explicit assumptions needed, and the user's example was incorrectly formatted. Given that, but following the instruction, perhaps list the convergence as the assumption. However, in the example, the user listed properties of the variable n. Here, the variable is a summation index, so n is a non-negative integer. Therefore, the assumption is:\n\nAssumption: \nn is a non-negative integer.\n\nProblem: \nProve that $$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{n^2}{2^n} = 6$$.\n\nBut in the problem statement, n is a dummy variable in the summation, so technically, the summation is a constant, not a function of n. So the assumption about n being a non-negative integer is inherent to the summation notation. Therefore, maybe the user's example was incorrect, but following the pattern, list n as a non-negative integer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has no assumptions, but the format requires listing them. If the example includes assumptions even when they are part of the problem's original statement, then perhaps here, we should list that the series converges. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, but aiming to adhere to the user's example structure, I'll proceed to list the assumption as n being a non-negative integer, since the summation is from n=0 to infinity, and each term involves n as an exponent and coefficient, which typically assumes n is an integer.",
