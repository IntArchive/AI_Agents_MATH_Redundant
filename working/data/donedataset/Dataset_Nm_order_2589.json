    "Content": "In a problem I’m working on, I have positive integers $a,b,c,d$ satisfying $$\n(ab)^2-2(cd)^2=1.  \\tag{1}\n$$ (So evidently $cd$ is a Pell number, and $ab$ is its companion.) Furthermore, say the following divisibility conditions also hold: \\begin{align}\na &\\mid (b^2+2c^2) \\\\\nb &\\mid (a^2-2d^2) \\\\ \\tag{2}\nc &\\mid (a^2+d^2) \\\\\nd &\\mid (b^2-c^2).\n\\end{align} A brute-force computer search turns up only two solutions so far: $(a,b,c,d)=(3,1,1,2)$ and $(a,b,c,d)=(3,1,2,1)$ . I believe they may be the only ones. I’ve tried to algebraically prove that conjecture, to no avail. From the divisibility system, we see that $a$ must be of the form $x^2+2y^2$ , and $c$ must be of the form $u^2+v^2$ . From $(1),$ we deduce, for example, that $\\gcd(ab,cd)=1$ , and also $ab=r^2+2s^2$ (so $b$ is also of that form) and $cd=2rs$ with $r^2-2s^2=\\pm1$ . But I can’t seem to find the magic combination to complete the proof. Any hints, assistance, or references would be appreciated.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Prompted by a suggestion from @gnasher729 I have analysed the solutions to (1) that satisfy one or more of (2) where the larger of a,b or the larger of c,d divides the relevant expression of (2). Defining $(x_k, y_k)$ to be the k-th solution to $x^2-2y^2=1$ , so for $k=0$ to $5$ , $(x_k, y_k) =  (1,0), (3, 2),(17, 12),(99, 70),(577, 408),(3363, 2378) $ The vast majority of results are where the smaller of a,b = 1 or the smaller of c,d = 1. Apart for a small number of results for $(x_3,y_3),(x_6,y_6),(x_9,y_9)$ , the only other results occur for odd values of k when $x_k$ is of the form $m^2−1$ , and $(a,b)=(m+1,m−1)$ or $(m−1,m+1)$ .

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's start by breaking down the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question. The user wants to structure the problem into the specified format, which includes listing assumptions line by line and then stating the problem. \n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions given in the original question. The problem involves positive integers a, b, c, d that satisfy two main conditions: equation (1) and the divisibility conditions in (2). The user also mentions that computer searches found only two solutions, and they want to prove these are the only ones.\n\nLet me go through each part step by step. The equation (ab)^2 - 2(cd)^2 = 1 is given. So the first assumption is that a, b, c, d are positive integers. Then equation (1) must hold. Then the divisibility conditions: a divides (b² + 2c²), b divides (a² - 2d²), c divides (a² + d²), and d divides (b² - c²). Each of these divisibility conditions is a separate assumption. \n\nAdditionally, the user mentions that from the divisibility system, a must be of the form x² + 2y², and c must be of the form u² + v². However, these seem like deductions or properties derived from the assumptions rather than given conditions. The original problem doesn't state these forms as initial assumptions, so I should exclude them. The problem statement also mentions gcd(ab, cd)=1, which comes from equation (1) because if a prime divides both ab and cd, it would divide 1, which isn't possible. But again, this is a deduction, not an initial assumption. \n\nTherefore, the original assumptions are:\n\n1. a, b, c, d are positive integers.\n2. (ab)² - 2(cd)² = 1.\n3. a divides (b² + 2c²).\n4. b divides (a² - 2d²).\n5. c divides (a² + d²).\n6. d divides (b² - c²).\n\nEach of these is a separate line in the assumptions. The problem is to prove that the only solutions are the two given pairs. The user's original problem statement says they believe these may be the only ones and want to prove it. So the problem part is to show that the only solutions under these assumptions are (3,1,1,2) and (3,1,2,1).\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is listed clearly and concisely, addressing one condition per line. Also, check that no extra information is included beyond what's necessary. For example, the mention of Pell numbers and companions is context but not an assumption, so it's excluded. Similarly, the deductions about the forms of a and c are part of the user's thoughts, not given conditions.\n\nSo structuring the answer accordingly, the assumptions list each condition, and the problem is to prove the only solutions are the two found.",
