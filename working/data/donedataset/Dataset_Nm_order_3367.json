    "Content": "$A\\in M_3(\\mathbb R)$ orthogonal matrix with $\\det (A)=1$. I need to prove that $(\\mathrm{tr} A)^2-\\mathrm{tr}(A^2) = 2 \\mathrm{tr} (A)$ ; $\\mathrm{tr}$=trace. I know that if $A$ is orthogonal than $A^tA=I$ and that $A$ is diagonalizable and similar to $D=\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\lambda_1 &  & \\\\ \n & \\lambda_2 & \\\\ \n &  & \\lambda_3\n\\end{pmatrix}$. We know as well that $\\mathrm{tr} A=\\mathrm{tr} D= \\lambda_1+ \\lambda_2+\\lambda_3$  that  $\\mathrm{tr} A^2=\\mathrm{tr} D^2= \\lambda_1^2+ \\lambda_2^2+\\lambda_3^2$ and that \n$\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 \\lambda_3=1$. It's not enough for solving the question. What more should I know or use in order to solve it? Thanks",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. The example provided shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then the problem statement follows.\n\nLooking at the original problem:\n\nTitle: $A\\in M_3(\\mathbb R)$ orthogonal matrix with $\\det (A)=1$. Prove that $(\\mathrm{tr} A)^2- \\mathrm{tr}(A^2) = 2 \\mathrm{tr} (A)$\n\nQuestion body elaborates on the user's knowledge: A is orthogonal, so $A^tA=I$, it's diagonalizable, similar to a diagonal matrix D with eigenvalues λ1, λ2, λ3. They know trace properties and that the product of eigenvalues (determinant) is 1. They need to figure out what else is needed to prove the trace identity.\n\nSo, first, identify the assumptions. The problem states:\n\n1. A is a 3x3 real matrix: $A \\in M_3(\\mathbb{R})$\n2. A is orthogonal: $A^T A = I$\n3. The determinant of A is 1: $\\det(A) = 1$\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. Then the problem is to prove that $(\\mathrm{tr} A)^2 - \\mathrm{tr}(A^2) = 2 \\mathrm{tr} (A)$.\n\nWait, but in the example given by the user, they included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, no, the example had the original problem where n is any integer, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no, the original example problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem in the example included \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the example is wrong? Wait, let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like a mistake because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption shouldn't restrict n to be divisible by 7. Maybe the example is incorrect? But the user provided that example as their own structuring. Hmm. Maybe the user made a mistake, but regardless, I need to follow their format.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user is asking to structure the problem from Math Stack Exchange. The problem given is that A is a 3x3 real orthogonal matrix with determinant 1, and to prove the trace identity. So the assumptions should be:\n\n- A is in M_3(R) (3x3 real matrices)\n- A is orthogonal (A^T A = I)\n- det(A) = 1\n\nEach of these is one line. Then the problem is to prove the equation.\n\nThe user in their question also mentions that they know about the trace and determinant properties, but that's part of their existing knowledge, not part of the problem's assumptions. So the problem's assumptions are only what's given in the problem statement.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n$A$ is a 3×3 real matrix,\n$A$ is orthogonal,\n$\\det(A) = 1$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $(\\mathrm{tr} A)^2 - \\mathrm{tr}(A^2) = 2 \\mathrm{tr} (A)$.\n\nI think that's correct. Each assumption is a separate line, each applies to one object (A) with different properties. The problem is to prove the trace identity. The example might have had an error, but following the instructions, this should be the right structure.",
