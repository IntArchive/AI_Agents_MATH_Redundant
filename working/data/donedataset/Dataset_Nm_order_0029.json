    "Content": "It is very elementary to show that $\\mathbb{R}$ isn't homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^m$ for $m>1$: subtract a point and use the fact that connectedness is a homeomorphism invariant. Along similar lines, you can show that $\\mathbb{R^2}$ isn't homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^m$ for $m>2$ by subtracting a point and checking if the resulting space is simply connected. Still straightforward, but a good deal less elementary. However, the general result that $\\mathbb{R^n}$ isn't homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R^m}$ for $n\\neq m$, though intuitively obvious, is usually proved using sophisticated results from algebraic topology, such as invariance of domain or extensions of the Jordan curve theorem. Is there a more elementary proof of this fact? If not, is there intuition for why a proof is so difficult?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "There are reasonably accessible proofs that are purely general topology. First one needs to show Brouwer's fixed point theorem (which has an elementary proof, using barycentric subdivion and Sperner's lemma), or some result of similar hardness. Then one defines a topological dimension function (there are 3 that all coincide for separable metric spaces, dim (covering dimension), ind (small inductive dimension), Ind (large inductive dimension)), say we use dim, and then we show (using Brouwer) that $\\dim(\\mathbb{R}^n) = n$ for all $n$. As homeomorphic spaces have the same dimension (which is quite clear from the definition), this gives the result. This is in essence the approach Brouwer himself took, but he used a now obsolete dimension function called Dimensionsgrad in his paper, which does coincide with dim etc. for locally compact, locally connected separable metric spaces. Lebesgue proposed the covering dimension, but had a false proof for $\\dim(\\mathbb{R}^n) = n$, which Brouwer corrected. One can find such proofs in Engelking (general topology), Nagata (dimension theory), or nicely condensed in van Mill's books on infinite dimensional topology. These proofs do not use homology, homotopy etc., although one could say that the Brouwer proof of his fixed point theorem (via barycentric division etc.) was a precursor to such ideas.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question according to the given format. Let me read through the original question carefully.\n\nThe title is \"Elementary proof that ℝⁿ is not homeomorphic to ℝᵐ\". The question starts by saying that it's elementary to show ℝ isn't homeomorphic to ℝᵐ for m > 1 by subtracting a point and using connectedness. Similarly, ℝ² vs. ℝᵐ for m > 2 involves subtracting a point and checking simple connectedness. The general case for n ≠ m usually uses algebraic topology results, and the user is asking if there's a more elementary proof or intuition why it's hard.\n\nThe task is to filter out unrelated info and structure the problem with assumptions and the problem statement. The example given included assumptions about the objects involved. In the original problem example, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is about homeomorphism between ℝⁿ and ℝᵐ.\n\nFirst, identify the assumptions. The problem is about showing ℝⁿ is not homeomorphic to ℝᵐ when n ≠ m. The user mentions that proofs for specific cases (like m=1 vs m>1) use methods like subtracting a point and checking connectedness or simple connectedness. The general case requires more sophisticated tools. The user is looking for an elementary proof.\n\nSo the assumptions would be the conditions under which the problem is posed. The problem states that ℝⁿ isn't homeomorphic to ℝᵐ when n ≠ m. So the assumptions would include that n and m are integers, n ≠ m, and perhaps that they are considering the standard Euclidean spaces with the usual topology. However, the original question doesn't explicitly state these as assumptions but rather they are part of the problem's context. Since the example structured the assumption by listing properties of the objects involved (like n being integer, divisible by 7), I need to extract such conditions here.\n\nLooking at the problem statement: \"Prove that ℝⁿ isn't homeomorphic to ℝᵐ for n ≠ m.\" The assumptions needed here would be:\n\n- n and m are integers.\n- n ≠ m.\n- ℝⁿ and ℝᵐ are equipped with their standard Euclidean topologies.\n\nThese are the implicit assumptions in the problem. The original question mentions methods using subtracting points and checking properties like connectedness or simple connectedness, but those are part of the approach, not assumptions. The key assumptions are about n, m being distinct positive integers and the spaces being standard Euclidean.\n\nTherefore, structuring the problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- n and m are integers.\n- n ≠ m.\n- ℝⁿ and ℝᵐ are topological spaces with their standard Euclidean topologies.\n\nProblem: Prove that ℝⁿ is not homeomorphic to ℝᵐ.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included a specific condition (n divisible by 7) which was part of the problem's original statement. However, in this case, the original problem is more general. The user is asking for a proof that ℝⁿ isn't homeomorphic to ℝᵐ when n ≠ m, without any additional constraints. So perhaps the assumptions are just the basic ones that n and m are integers, n ≠ m, and the spaces are standard.\n\nBut the original problem as stated in the user's question doesn't have any specific conditions beyond n ≠ m. So maybe the assumptions are just:\n\n- n and m are positive integers.\n- n ≠ m.\n\nBut the example included specific conditions. Let me check the example again. The original problem was about proving A(n) is divisible by 91. The user formatted assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the user said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that might be a mistake. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem assumption lists n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But that seems contradictory because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which restricts it. Maybe the example was a mistake, or perhaps it's a different problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the example is correct if the original problem had a typo or if the user intended to restructure it with a specific assumption. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instruction to structure the given problem according to the example.\n\nIn the current problem, the user is asking for an elementary proof that ℝⁿ is not homeomorphic to ℝᵐ when n ≠ m. The assumptions would be the basic conditions under which the problem is posed. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n- n and m are positive integers.\n- n ≠ m.\n- ℝⁿ and ℝᵐ are topological spaces with their standard Euclidean topologies.\n\nProblem: Prove that ℝⁿ is not homeomorphic to ℝᵐ.\n\nBut in the example, the assumption included a specific condition (divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem's universal statement. That seems like an error. Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". That would mean the formatted problem is actually a specific case, maybe the user made a mistake. But perhaps the example was to show that sometimes assumptions are not explicitly stated. However, in the current problem, there's no such hidden assumption. The problem is general.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions in the example were incorrect. But regardless, I need to structure the current problem.\n\nThe key points are:\n\n- The problem is about homeomorphism between ℝⁿ and ℝᵐ.\n- The question is to prove they are not homeomorphic when n ≠ m.\n- The user mentions that specific cases (like m=1 vs m>1) can be handled with elementary methods, but the general case needs algebraic topology.\n\nThus, the problem as posed is to prove the general case. The assumptions would be n and m are distinct positive integers, and the spaces are standard Euclidean.\n\nHence, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn and m are positive integers,\nn ≠ m,\nℝⁿ is equipped with the standard Euclidean topology,\nℝᵐ is equipped with the standard Euclidean topology.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ℝⁿ is not homeomorphic to ℝᵐ.\n\nBut the original question on Math Stack Exchange is asking if there's an elementary proof for this general case, not to restate the problem. However, the task is to structure the problem as per the format, which requires listing assumptions and the problem statement. The user's example seems to have taken the original problem and added an assumption (divisible by 7) which wasn't in the original problem's universal statement. That might be an error, but perhaps in the example, the user wanted to highlight a specific case. However, in the current problem, the user is asking about the general case. So I need to structure the problem as is, extracting the implicit assumptions.\n\nAnother way to look: In the example, the original problem was \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems contradictory. Maybe the example was a different problem. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem had a mistake, and the formatted version corrects it. But in the current case, we need to structure the problem without adding incorrect assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the correct assumptions here are:\n\n- n and m are positive integers.\n- n ≠ m.\n- ℝⁿ and ℝᵐ are topological spaces with their standard Euclidean topologies.\n\nAnd the problem is to prove they are not homeomorphic.\n\nSo the formatted problem would have those assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nI think that's correct.",
