    "Content": "The classic example... $X \\sim Po\\left (\\lambda\\right ), Y \\sim Po\\left (\\mu\\right)$ , X and Y are independent.  Show that the conditional distribution of X is binomially distributed. Or in other words, $P(X=k\\mid X+Y = n) = P (\\tilde{X} = k), \\tilde{X} \\sim B\\left (n ,\\frac{\\lambda}{\\lambda + \\mu}\\right )$ . I've so far managed to reach to this step, and have been stuck since. Just somehow gotta get a $\\frac{1}{n!}$ in the denominator, that would then complete the proof..or at least I think.. $$P(X=k\\mid X+Y=n) = \\frac{\\frac{\\lambda^{k}\\mu^{n-k}}{k!(n-k)!}}{P(X+Y = n)}=\n \\frac{\\frac{\\lambda^{k}\\mu^{n-k}}{k!(n-k)!}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\lambda^{i}\\mu^{n-i}}{i!(n-i)!}}$$ Thanks for the help!",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants to show that the conditional distribution of X given X+Y=n is binomial with parameters n and λ/(λ+μ), where X and Y are independent Poisson variables with parameters λ and μ respectively.\n\nFirst, I recall that when you have two independent Poisson random variables, their sum X+Y is also Poisson with parameter λ+μ. That's a key property of Poisson distributions. So P(X+Y = n) should be e^{-(λ+μ)} (λ+μ)^n / n! . \n\nLooking at the user's attempt, they have the conditional probability written as the joint probability divided by the marginal probability of X+Y=n. The joint probability P(X=k, Y=n-k) is the product of P(X=k) and P(Y=n-k) since X and Y are independent. Each of those is a Poisson probability mass function: e^{-λ} λ^k /k! * e^{-μ} μ^{n−k}/(n−k)! . Multiplying those gives e^{-(λ+μ)} λ^k μ^{n−k} / (k! (n−k)!) . \n\nThen the denominator P(X+Y=n) is indeed e^{-(λ+μ)} (λ+μ)^n / n! . So substituting these into the conditional probability formula, we have:\n\nP(X=k | X+Y=n) = [e^{-(λ+μ)} λ^k μ^{n−k} / (k! (n−k)!)] / [e^{-(λ+μ)} (λ+μ)^n / n! ]\n\nThe e^{-(λ+μ)} terms cancel out. Then we can rearrange the remaining terms as [λ^k μ^{n−k} / (k! (n−k)!)) ] * [n! / (λ+μ)^n ].\n\nSimplifying, n! / (k! (n−k)!) is the binomial coefficient C(n,k), so this becomes C(n,k) * (λ^k μ^{n−k}) / (λ+μ)^n . \n\nWe can factor out (λ/(λ+μ))^k * (μ/(λ+μ))^{n−k}, which is the form of a binomial distribution with probability p = λ/(λ+μ) and n trials. Therefore, the conditional distribution is Binomial(n, λ/(λ+μ)).\n\nThe user mentioned being stuck on getting a 1/n! in the denominator. Let me check their steps. They have the numerator as λ^k μ^{n−k}/(k!(n−k)!), and the denominator as the sum over i of λ^i μ^{n−i}/(i!(n−i)!). Wait, if we compute the denominator correctly as the PMF of X+Y, which is Poisson, then the denominator should be e^{-(λ+μ)} (λ+μ)^n /n! . So when we divide numerator by denominator, the e^{-(λ+μ)} terms cancel, and we get [λ^k μ^{n−k}/(k! (n−k)!)] / [(λ+μ)^n /n!] = [n! / (k! (n−k)!)] * [λ^k μ^{n−k}/(λ+μ)^n] = C(n,k) (λ/(λ+μ))^k (μ/(λ+μ))^{n−k}, which is the binomial PMF. So the user's confusion might be in not recognizing that the sum in the denominator actually evaluates to the Poisson PMF, which allows simplification. They were probably expanding the sum unnecessarily. Instead, by knowing that the sum of independent Poissons is Poisson, we can directly substitute the denominator, avoiding the summation. That's probably where the 1/n! comes from in the denominator when they use the Poisson PMF for X+Y=n.",
