    "Content": "When playing with the complete elliptic integral of the first kind and its Fourier-Legendre expansion, I discovered that a consequence of $\\sum_{n\\geq 0}\\binom{2n}{n}^2\\frac{1}{16^n(4n+1)}=\\frac{1}{16\\pi^2}\\,\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^4 $ is: $$\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{\\arctan x}{\\sqrt{x(1-x^2)}}\\,dx = \\tfrac{1}{32}\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\,\\Gamma\\left(\\tfrac{1}{4}\\right)^2\\tag{A}$$ which might be regarded as a sort of Ahmed's integral under steroids . I already have a proof of this statement (through Fourier-Legendre expansions), but I would be happy to see a more direct and elementary proof of it, also because it might have some consequences about the moments of $K(x)$ of the form $\\int_{0}^{1}K(x)\\,x^{m\\pm 1/4}\\,dx$, which are associated with peculiar hypergeometric functions.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into their specified structure. The example they provided shows that I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement from the original question, filtering out any unrelated information.\n\nLooking at the example, the original problem had some conditions and the problem statement. The formatted version listed each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then the problem was restated clearly.\n\nNow, looking at the current problem from Math Stack Exchange. The title is about an integral involving arctan and a square root in the denominator. The question body mentions discovering a consequence of a series involving binomial coefficients and Gamma functions, leading to an integral result. The user wants a more direct proof, mentions Fourier-Legendre expansions, and some implications about moments of K(x). But the main problem is the integral equality.\n\nSo, first, I need to identify the assumptions. The integral is from 0 to 1. The integrand is arctan(x) divided by sqrt(x(1 - x²)). The problem is to prove that this integral equals (1/32)sqrt(2π) times Gamma(1/4)^2. \n\nAre there any hidden assumptions here? The integrand has sqrt(x(1 - x²)), so the domain of integration is from 0 to 1, because for x >1, the denominator would involve sqrt of negative number, which isn't real. So the assumption is that the integral is over the interval [0,1]. Also, the integrand involves arctan(x), which is defined for all real x, so no problem there. But maybe we need to assume that the integral is convergent? Since at x=0, sqrt(x) is in the denominator, which might make the integrand behave like 1/sqrt(x) near 0, which is integrable. Similarly, near x=1, 1 - x² becomes sqrt(1 - x) which is also integrable. So maybe no additional assumptions needed beyond the integral being over [0,1]. \n\nThe original question also mentions that the user already has a proof using Fourier-Legendre expansions but wants a more elementary proof. However, the problem statement as per the format should just present the integral equality to prove. The assumptions would just be the interval of integration and perhaps the functions involved, but in the example provided, assumptions were about the variables involved. Here, the integral is definite, so maybe the main assumption is the interval [0,1], but since the problem is to compute the integral, perhaps there are no variables with conditions. Wait, in the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem, it was for every integer n. So the user there corrected the assumptions. \n\nIn this current problem, the integral is fixed, so maybe the only assumption is that the integral is taken over [0,1], but the example didn't list that as an assumption. Wait, in the example, the assumptions were about the variable in the problem. Here, the problem is to compute a specific integral, so perhaps there are no variables with conditions. Therefore, maybe the assumptions section is empty? But the example shows that assumptions can be about the problem's conditions. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example: The original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem had assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted version added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, the user example might have a mistake? Let me check.\n\nOriginal example's original problem says: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem has assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that's conflicting. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted version adds that n must be divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Perhaps the user provided an incorrect example? Or maybe they intended to show filtering out unrelated information. Wait, maybe the original problem had a mistake and the formatted version corrected it? Or perhaps the example is illustrative of how to structure, even if the content is altered.\n\nIn any case, perhaps for the current problem, the assumptions are implicit in the integral's limits and the functions involved. But according to the user's instruction, each assumption addresses only one property or condition applied to one object. In the current problem, the integral is definite from 0 to 1, so maybe the assumption is that x is in [0,1]. However, since the integral is already stated as from 0 to 1, perhaps that's part of the problem statement and not an assumption. Maybe there are no explicit assumptions here, but in the example, they listed n is an integer as an assumption even though the problem stated \"for every integer n\". So maybe in this problem, the assumption is that the integral is over x from 0 to 1. Wait, but the problem statement already says \"integrate from 0 to 1\", so perhaps that's part of the problem, not an assumption. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the integrand's properties are the assumptions. For example, arctan x is defined and continuous on [0,1], the denominator sqrt(x(1 - x²)) is real and positive on (0,1), and the integral converges. But the problem states the integral equals a certain value, so perhaps the only assumption is that the integral exists. But since the problem is to prove the equality, maybe the existence is part of what needs to be proven, not an assumption. \n\nGiven the example, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", the formatted version included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, which seems redundant but structured that way. So perhaps here, even though the integral is from 0 to 1, we can list that as an assumption. Wait, the example's formatted problem included \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in their example? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\", which changes the problem. That seems like a mistake. \n\nBut regardless, following the user's example, perhaps the assumptions are the conditions on the variables or the domain. For the current problem, the integral is definite, so maybe there's no variable with conditions, hence no assumptions. However, in the example, they included assumptions even when the problem was about all integers. Maybe the user intended to list any implicit assumptions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem as stated doesn't have any assumptions beyond the integral being over [0,1], which is already part of the problem statement. So perhaps in this case, the assumptions section is empty. But the example shows that even if the original problem states \"for every integer n\", they list \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So following that, perhaps here, even if the integral is from 0 to 1, we can list \"x is in the interval [0,1]\" as an assumption. But in the example, the assumptions were about the variable n, not the variable of integration. The variable of integration is a dummy variable, so perhaps it's not necessary. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions here are about the integrand being defined and integrable over [0,1], but again, that's part of the problem's context. Since the user wants to filter unrelated information, perhaps the problem is just the integral equality, and there are no additional assumptions. \n\nLooking back at the user's instructions: \"filtered the unrelated information, and structure that problem as the following format.\" The example had the original problem mentioning the context of elliptic integrals and Fourier-Legendre expansions, but the formatted problem only included the integral to prove. So here, the original question mentions the context of the complete elliptic integral and Fourier-Legendre expansions, but the formatted problem should just state the integral to prove. \n\nTherefore, the assumptions section may not be needed here, but according to the format, we need to list assumptions. However, the problem as posed is to compute a definite integral, so perhaps there are no variables with conditions. In that case, maybe the assumptions are empty. But the example included assumptions even when the problem was for all integers n, which might have been a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to have assumptions listed even if they are part of the problem statement. \n\nGiven that the example included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption when the problem stated \"for every integer n\", perhaps in this case, the assumption is that x is a real variable in [0,1]. However, since x is the variable of integration, its domain is already specified in the integral. \n\nBut maybe the user wants each assumption to be listed even if it's part of the problem's setup. So perhaps here, we can write:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is taken over the interval [0, 1].\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about the variable n, not the integral's limits. Alternatively, maybe there are no assumptions here, so the assumption section is empty. However, the format requires the assumption section. \n\nWait, looking at the example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem's assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" But the original problem's conclusion was that A(n) is divisible by 91 (which is 7*13). If n is divisible by 7, then perhaps the problem becomes easier, but in the original problem, it's for every integer n. There's a contradiction here. It seems like the example might have a mistake. Perhaps the original problem had a different condition, but the user structured it with a different assumption. \n\nRegardless, the user wants to apply their format. For the current problem, perhaps the only assumption is that the integral is over [0,1], but since that's already part of the problem statement, maybe it's redundant. Alternatively, the problem might have an implicit assumption that the integral converges. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integrand $\\frac{\\arctan x}{\\sqrt{x(1-x^2)}}$ is integrable over [0, 1].\n\nBut is that an assumption or part of what needs to be proven? Since the problem is to compute the integral, perhaps the integrability is part of the proof. But maybe we can take it as an assumption. However, in mathematical proofs, usually, we don't assume integrability unless specified. \n\nGiven the user's example, which took a problem stating \"for every integer n\" and formatted it with \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, perhaps here we can list the interval as an assumption. But since the integral is written as ∫₀¹, that's part of the problem statement. So maybe the assumptions section is empty. But the format requires it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has no explicit assumptions, so we can write \"None\" or leave it blank, but the example didn't do that. The example included assumptions even when they were part of the problem's original statement. \n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the safest way is to follow the example's approach. The example's original problem was about proving for every integer n, and the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, which was part of the original problem's statement. So here, the original problem's integral is from 0 to 1, so the assumption would be that the variable x is in [0,1]. However, x is the dummy variable of integration, so it's already bound by the integral's limits. Therefore, perhaps the assumption is redundant. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are about the functions involved. For example, arctan x is differentiable, or the denominator is positive, but again, these are part of the problem's context. \n\nGiven that in the example, the assumptions were about the variable in the problem (n being an integer and divisible by 7), perhaps in this problem, since there's no variable with conditions, the assumptions section is empty. However, the format requires the assumption section, so maybe we need to list something. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might have an implicit assumption that the integral is evaluated in the real numbers, but that's standard. \n\nGiven the user's example, perhaps the correct approach is to list any conditions on the variables involved. Here, since the integral is definite from 0 to 1, and x is the integration variable, there are no variables left with conditions. Hence, the assumptions section might be empty. But the example didn't have an empty assumption section. \n\nWait, the example's original problem was to prove for every integer n, so the variable n was universally quantified. The formatted problem's assumption section listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But that changes the problem from \"for all integers\" to \"for integers divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Unless the original problem had a typo, and the formatted version corrected it. But that's unclear. \n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps in the current problem, since there are no variables with conditions (the integral is a specific definite integral), the assumptions section is empty. But the format requires it, so maybe we can write \"None\" or leave it out. However, the user's example shows that assumptions are listed even if they are part of the problem's original statement. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumption here is that the integral is being considered in the real numbers, but that's standard. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants to extract any conditions mentioned in the problem. The problem mentions \"the integrand arctan x over sqrt(x(1 - x²))\", so the denominator requires that x(1 - x²) > 0. Since the integral is from 0 to 1, x is between 0 and 1, so 1 - x² is positive, and x is non-negative. Thus, the denominator is positive in (0,1) and zero at x=0 and x=1. But the integrand has a square root, so the function is real and defined on (0,1). The limits approach zero and one. So perhaps the assumption is that x is in (0,1). But that's already part of the integral's domain. \n\nGiven the user's example, I think the best approach is to list the integral's interval as an assumption. Even though it's part of the problem statement, in the example, they listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption even though it was part of the original problem's statement. So following that pattern:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated over the interval [0, 1].\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{\\arctan x}{\\sqrt{x(1-x^2)}}\\,dx = \\tfrac{1}{32}\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\,\\Gamma\\left(\\tfrac{1}{4}\\right)^2.$$\n\nThis way, the assumption explicitly states the interval, even though it's part of the integral's notation. The example did a similar thing by listing \"n is an integer\" even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\".\n\nTherefore, this should be the formatted problem.",
