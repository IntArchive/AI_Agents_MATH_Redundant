    "Content": "This is something of a pedagogical question. Most of us have scratched our heads at some point as to why the definition of \"$f$ is continuous\" requires that the pre image of any open set under $f$ is open, then done a bunch of examples, then convinced ourselves. I think our confusion comes because when we first encounter \"continuity\" we are generally expecting a statement about what $f$ does to the images of sets, and get frustrated when we see a statement about what $f$ guarantees about the preimages of sets. I think that we might be able to restore this by instead looking at subspaces of the topological space and whether they are connected according to their subspace topology. Let's call a subset of a topological space which is connected according to its subspace topology a \"connected subset\". Connectedness is inherently a negative notion (\"there does not exist two open sets...\") and thus one is naturally induced to look at a contrapositive -- at images rather than preimages. So I think there might be a way to start from a more-intuitive definition, for example: \"$f: X \\to Y$ is continuous iff $X$ and $Y$ are topological spaces and the image of any connected subset of $X$ is a connected subset of $Y$.\" This would seem immediately intuitive to a student, I feel. And if we start from there, then immediately the contrapositive accomplishes the reversal: \"$f: X \\to Y$ is continuous iff the preimage of any disconnected subset of $Y$ is a disconnected subset of $X$.\" Now it's clear that the latter is necessary for $f$ to be continuous according to the conventional definition. If $f$ is conventionally-continuous  then when we factor a disconnected subset of $Y$ into two disjoint open subsets, the preimage of each subset is open and the preimages of two disjoint sets must also be disjoint, proving that the subset of $X$ was disconnected, too. However I am struggling with rigorously proving sufficiency and thereby deriving the conventional definition from the intuitive one. The existential quantifiers of disconnectedness seem to really get in my way: for example even if I could somehow state \"for every nonempty open set there exists some other disjoint nonempty open set\" (which is false for the trivial topology but maybe that's not such an issue) the above definition seemingly does not guarantee that the corresponding preimages of the two are open -- maybe this partition of the $Y$-subset has very little to do with the partition of the $X$-subset, for example. So it's not clear to me how to push past these weird existentials and come to \"the preimage of any open set is open\" again. Am I missing some obvious counterexample that shows this whole enterprise is a mistake, or clarifies some extra assumptions I'll need in my definition to make it work? If not, what technique might I use to finish the sufficiency side of the proof?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The short answer is that there are functions which are not conventionally continuous, but which are connected-set-contininuous. For example, one can use any $f:\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ with the following property: If $X:=(a,b)$ is any non-empty open interval, then $f(X) =\\mathbb{R}$. One example of such an $f$ is Conway's base 13 function . Such a function cannot be continuous because it is unbounded on every non-trivial closed interval (because a non-trivial closed interval contains a non-trivial open interval as a subset). On the other hand, the connected subsets of $\\mathbb{R}$ are points or are intervals (with or without some end points).  Of course, the image of a point is connected.  The image of an interval is also connected:  every interval has an open subinterval, and then $f$ applied to the open subinterval is already all of $\\mathbb{R}$, which is connected.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about whether continuity can be phrased in terms of connectedness. The user wants to know if defining a function as continuous when the image of every connected subset is connected leads to the standard definition of continuity involving preimages of open sets. They're struggling with proving the sufficiency of this condition to derive the conventional definition.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The user mentions topological spaces X and Y, and a function f: X → Y. The key conditions they're considering are about connected subsets. The proposed definition is that f is continuous if the image of any connected subset of X is a connected subset of Y. But they're trying to see if this implies the standard preimage of open sets condition.\n\nSo assumptions here would include that X and Y are topological spaces, that f is a function between them, and the specific condition about images of connected subsets. Each assumption should be one line, addressing one property or object. The problem is to prove that this condition (images of connected subsets are connected) implies that f is continuous in the standard sense (preimages of open sets are open).\n\nWait, but the user is trying to derive the standard definition from their connectedness-based definition. So the problem would be phrased as proving that if f maps connected subsets to connected subsets, then f is continuous. However, the user also mentions that they're struggling with the sufficiency part. So the problem is to prove that the condition on connected images implies continuity.\n\nBut the original question also discusses the contrapositive approach, talking about preimages of disconnected subsets. However, the main problem is about the equivalence between the connected image condition and continuity.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- X is a topological space.\n- Y is a topological space.\n- f: X → Y is a function.\n- For every connected subset C of X, f(C) is a connected subset of Y.\n\nThe problem is to prove that f is continuous.\n\nBut wait, the user also mentioned that they want to derive the conventional definition (preimages of open sets are open) from the connectedness condition. So the problem is to show that if f satisfies that the image of every connected subset is connected, then f is continuous.\n\nHowever, there's a possible issue here. Because the user is asking whether their proposed definition is equivalent to the standard one. But actually, the standard definition of continuity is equivalent to the condition that the preimage of closed sets is closed, or that the preimage of open sets is open. The user's proposed definition is about preserving connectedness of subsets under images. But in general, a function that preserves connectedness in images is not necessarily continuous. For example, consider a function from R to R that maps every interval to a connected set but has jumps—such a function might not be continuous. So maybe there's a missing assumption here. Wait, but the user is trying to see if their definition is equivalent, and they're stuck on proving sufficiency, so maybe the actual problem is under what conditions does preserving connectedness of subsets imply continuity.\n\nBut according to the original problem, the user is suggesting that their definition (preserving connected images) should imply continuity. But in reality, this is not true. For example, take any function from a discrete space to a connected space. In discrete space, every subset is connected if it's a singleton, but images of connected subsets (singletons) are connected, but the function isn't necessarily continuous. Wait, in discrete topology, every function is continuous because every preimage is open. Hmm. Maybe that's not a good example. Let's think of another example: take X as the real line with standard topology, Y as real line with standard topology. Let f be a function that is not continuous, say a step function. However, if f maps intervals to intervals, then f(C) is connected. But a step function would have images that are intervals (if it's, say, constant on some intervals and jumps), but the image would still be connected. Wait, no. For example, if f(x) is 0 for x < 0 and 1 for x ≥ 0. Then the image of the connected subset [-1,1] is {0,1}, which is disconnected. So in this case, the function is not continuous, and it fails to preserve connectedness. So maybe continuous functions are exactly those that preserve connectedness. Wait, that's actually a theorem: a function is continuous if and only if the image of every connected set is connected. Wait, is that true? No, actually, the standard theorem is that continuous functions preserve connectedness, but the converse is not true. So there exist discontinuous functions that still map connected sets to connected sets.\n\nWait, no. Let me recall: If a function is continuous, then the image of a connected set is connected. However, the converse is not necessarily true. For example, consider a function f: R → R where f(x) = sin(1/x) for x ≠ 0 and f(0) = 0. This function is not continuous at 0. However, the image of any connected set is connected? Wait, no. If you take a connected set that includes 0 and some points around it, the image might oscillate wildly near zero, but maybe still be connected. Wait, actually, the image of any interval around zero would include values between -1 and 1, which is connected. But maybe there's another example. Alternatively, consider a function that is constant on each connected component. For example, if X is a discrete space with two points, and Y is a connected space. Then any function from X to Y maps connected subsets (singletons) to connected subsets, but the function is automatically continuous because the domain is discrete. Hmm, not helpful. Alternatively, take X as the real line with the co-finite topology, and Y as the real line with standard topology. Then a function that is not continuous in the standard sense might still map connected sets (which in co-finite topology are all sets, since the only disconnected sets are finite sets) to connected sets. But I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, maybe the user is correct that their condition is equivalent, but I need to check. Suppose f: X → Y is such that the image of every connected subset of X is connected in Y. Does this imply f is continuous? If not, then the problem as posed by the user is incorrect, and the answer would involve a counterexample. However, in standard topology, continuity implies preserving connectedness, but the converse is not true. For example, take X = Y = R, and define f(x) = x for x ≠ 0 and f(0) = 1. This function is discontinuous at 0. Consider the connected subset [−1, 1]. The image is [−1, 0) ∪ {1} ∪ (0, 1], which is not connected. So actually, this function does not preserve connectedness. Hmm. Wait, maybe any function that doesn't preserve connectedness is discontinuous, but there are discontinuous functions that do preserve connectedness. Wait, but in the example above, the function does not preserve connectedness. Maybe there's no such function that preserves connectedness but is discontinuous. Let me think. Suppose f: R → R is a function that is not continuous, but maps connected sets to connected sets. Is that possible? Let's say f is the identity function except at 0, where f(0) = 0. That's continuous. If f is the identity except at 0, where f(0) = 1. Then as before, the image of [−1,1] is [−1,0) ∪ {1} ∪ (0,1], which is disconnected. So the function's discontinuity causes the image to be disconnected. Therefore, perhaps the converse is true: if a function preserves connectedness, then it is continuous. But wait, maybe in some other space. Let me think of a different example. Consider X as the real line with the standard topology, Y as the real line with the discrete topology. Then the identity function from X to Y is not continuous. However, the image of any connected subset in X (an interval) is a connected subset in Y? No, in discrete topology, the only connected subsets are singletons. So if you map an interval to Y, which is a set with multiple points, it's disconnected. Therefore, the identity function from X to Y would not preserve connectedness. So in this case, the function is discontinuous and does not preserve connectedness. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, consider X and Y both as the real line with standard topology. Suppose f is a function that is continuous except at a single point, but somehow manages to map every connected set to a connected set. Is that possible? Suppose f is constant on some intervals but not others. For example, let f(x) = 0 for x ≤ 0, and f(x) = x for x > 0. This function is continuous everywhere except possibly at 0. However, the image of any connected set is connected. Take an interval that includes 0, say [−1, 1]. The image is [−1,0] ∪ (0,1], which is actually connected because 0 is included in the image as f(0)=0, and the rest is (0,1]. Wait, no. Wait, the image of [−1,1] under f would be {0} ∪ (0,1], which is connected because it's the interval [0,1]. Because f(x) for x ≤ 0 is 0, and for x > 0 is x. So the image is [0,1], which is connected. Similarly, any interval not containing 0 would map to a connected set. If an interval is entirely ≤0, the image is {0}; if it's entirely >0, the image is an interval. If an interval crosses 0, the image is [0, max(f(x))]. So this function, which is not continuous at 0, actually does preserve connectedness. Wait, but is the function continuous? Let's check. The left limit at 0 is 0, the right limit is 0, and f(0)=0. So actually, this function is continuous. Hmm, bad example.\n\nWait, maybe take f(x) = sin(1/x) for x ≠ 0 and f(0) = 0. This function is discontinuous at 0. Let's see the image of a connected set. Take an interval around 0, say [−a, a] where a > 0. The image of this interval under f would be the union of {0} and the image of (0, a] under sin(1/x). The image of (0, a] under sin(1/x) is [−1, 1], so the total image is [−1, 1], which is connected. Similarly, any interval not containing 0 would map to a connected set because sin(1/x) is continuous there. So in this case, even though f is discontinuous at 0, it maps connected sets to connected sets. Wait, but this contradicts the earlier thought that only continuous functions preserve connectedness. Wait, maybe this function is not a counterexample because even though it's discontinuous, it still preserves connectedness? But that can't be right. Let me check more carefully. The function f(x) = sin(1/x) for x ≠0 and f(0)=0. Take the interval [−1,1]. The image is {0} ∪ sin(1/x) for x in (0,1]. The image of (0,1] under sin(1/x) is [-1,1], so the total image is [-1,1], which is connected. So even though the function is discontinuous at 0, the image of any connected set is connected. Therefore, this would be a counterexample: a discontinuous function that preserves connectedness, showing that the user's proposed definition does not capture continuity. Therefore, the original assumption that preserving connectedness implies continuity is false, and the problem as posed by the user has a counterexample.\n\nBut the user is asking how to prove the sufficiency, so maybe they are under a wrong impression that the definitions are equivalent. Therefore, the answer would involve pointing out this counterexample. However, in the problem structuring, the user is presenting their attempt and the problem they're facing, which is trying to prove the equivalence, but getting stuck. So in the formatted problem, the assumptions would include that f preserves connected subsets, and the problem is to prove f is continuous, but since this is not generally true, the problem might be to either find a counterexample or to identify additional assumptions needed.\n\nBut according to the user's original problem, they are trying to derive the conventional definition from their intuitive one, and are struggling with sufficiency. Therefore, the problem as structured should reflect their question: under the assumption that the image of every connected subset is connected, prove that f is continuous. However, as we've just found, this is not true in general, so the problem might be to show that under certain conditions (like X being locally connected or something), this holds, or to find a counterexample.\n\nBut the user's question is phrased as: \"Is there a way to phrase 'continuous' in terms of 'connected'?\" and they propose a definition and ask whether it's equivalent. So the formatted problem should capture their proposed definition and the task to prove equivalence, but given the analysis, the answer is that it's not equivalent, and the problem requires either a counterexample or additional assumptions.\n\nBut in the example given by the assistant earlier, the assumption included specific conditions (like n divisible by 7). However, in this case, the user's assumptions are the general ones: f maps connected subsets to connected subsets, and X, Y are topological spaces. The problem is to prove f is continuous. But since this is false in general, the formatted problem might include missing assumptions. However, the user hasn't mentioned any extra assumptions, so perhaps the formatted problem is exactly as they posed it, even though it's not correct. Alternatively, maybe the user is working under some implicit assumptions, like X is a connected space, but that's not stated.\n\nBut according to the user's problem statement, they propose the definition: \"f: X → Y is continuous iff X and Y are topological spaces and the image of any connected subset of X is a connected subset of Y.\" So the assumptions would be X, Y are topological spaces, f: X → Y, and for every connected subset C of X, f(C) is connected in Y. The problem is to prove that f is continuous. However, as we've seen, this is not true. So the formatted problem would list those assumptions and the problem to prove continuity, but the actual answer would involve a counterexample.\n\nBut the task here is not to solve the problem, but to structure it according to the given format. So based on the user's question, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a topological space,\nY is a topological space,\nf: X → Y is a function,\nFor every connected subset C of X, f(C) is a connected subset of Y.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f is continuous.\n\nEven though, in reality, this is not true, but the user is presenting this as their proposed definition and asking to derive continuity from it. Therefore, the formatted problem should capture the user's assumptions and their problem statement accurately, even if the underlying mathematics is incorrect. The purpose of the formatting is to extract the assumptions and the problem as presented, not to validate them.\n\nSo the answer should list the assumptions as above and the problem as proving continuity under those assumptions.",
