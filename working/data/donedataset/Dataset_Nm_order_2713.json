    "Content": "Suppose $\\mathcal{M}_1$ represents the space of smooth probability density functions with unit mean, whose support is contained in $[0,\\infty)$ (or $\\mathbb{R}_+$ ). Define the following functional $$\\mathrm{J}(f):= \\int_0^\\infty x\\frac{(f')^2}{f} \\mathrm{d}x$$ for $f \\in \\mathcal{M}_1.$ I am conjecturing that $$\\mathrm{J}(\\rho) \\leq \\mathrm{J}(f) \\quad \\text{with} \\quad \\rho(x): = \\int_{z\\geq x} \\frac{(f*f)(z)}{z} \\mathrm{d}z,$$ in which $f*f$ denotes the self-convolution of $f$ . I have tried some specific examples (even though not too many) and I did not find any counter-examples (analytically or numerically), so I am wondering whether there exists a proof of this conjecture/inequality, if not, a counter-example is welcome! Edit: The motivation behind this question is as follows. Take a random variable $X$ with law $f \\in \\mathcal{M}_1$ unit mean and supported on $[0,\\infty)$ , we can think of $\\mathrm{J}(f)$ as the information contained in $X$ (note that this is not the usual Fisher information, which is often denoted by $\\mathrm{I}(f)$ or $\\mathrm{I}(X)$ ). Here $\\rho$ is the law of $U(X+Y)$ with $U \\sim \\mathrm{Uniform}([0,1])$ and $Y$ being an i.i.d. copy of $X$ , in which $U$ is also independent of $X$ and $Y$ . I am conjecting that the $\\mathrm{J}$ information of $U(X+Y)$ is no larger than the $\\mathrm{J}$ information of $X$ .",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "It turns out there is a very simple counter-example (shame on me!). Simply take $f$ to be the uniform distribution $f(x) = \\frac 12\\mathbf{1}_{[0,2]}(x)$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to help structure this problem from the Math Stack Exchange question according to the given format. Let me start by carefully reading through the original question to understand all the components and assumptions.\n\nThe user is talking about a functional J defined on a space of probability density functions. The main goal is to prove an inequality involving J of a transformed density ρ and J of the original f. Let me break down the elements step by step.\n\nFirst, the space M1 is defined as smooth probability density functions with unit mean and support contained in [0, ∞). So, each f in M1 must satisfy these conditions. The functional J(f) is given as the integral from 0 to infinity of x times (f' squared over f) dx. \n\nThe conjecture is that J(ρ) is less than or equal to J(f), where ρ is defined as the integral from z ≥ x of (f*f)(z)/z dz. Here, f*f is the convolution of f with itself. \n\nAdditionally, the user provided motivation involving random variables. Specifically, ρ is the law of U(X+Y), where U is uniform on [0,1], X and Y are iid with law f, and U is independent of X and Y. The conjecture is that the J-information of U(X+Y) is no larger than that of X.\n\nNow, to structure this into the Assumption and Problem sections, I need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let's parse the problem:\n\n1. The space M1 consists of smooth probability density functions. So, each f is smooth (infinitely differentiable?), a PDF, so integrates to 1 over [0, ∞).\n2. Each f in M1 has unit mean. So, the expectation under f is 1.\n3. Support of each f is contained in [0, ∞). So, f(x) = 0 for x < 0.\n4. J(f) is defined as the integral from 0 to ∞ of x*(f')²/f dx. So, the functional J is defined for each f in M1.\n5. ρ is defined as the integral from z ≥ x of (f*f)(z)/z dz. Here, f*f is the convolution of f with itself. So, ρ is constructed from the convolution scaled by 1/z and integrated from x onwards.\n6. The conjecture is that J(ρ) ≤ J(f) for all f in M1.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user says \"with ρ defined as...\", so maybe ρ is dependent on f. So, for each f, we define ρ as that integral, and then we compare J(ρ) to J(f).\n\nSo, the assumptions would be:\n\n- f is a smooth probability density function (i.e., f ∈ M1)\n- f has unit mean (∫₀^∞ x f(x) dx = 1)\n- The support of f is contained in [0, ∞)\n- ρ is defined as ρ(x) = ∫_{z ≥ x} (f*f)(z)/z dz\n- The functional J is defined as J(f) = ∫₀^∞ x (f'(x))² / f(x) dx\n\nWait, but in the original problem statement, the user is in the space M1, so all f in M1 already satisfy the first three conditions. Then, ρ is constructed from f via that integral involving convolution. So, perhaps the assumptions should list all the conditions that the problem imposes. Since M1 is defined with those properties, the assumptions would include that f is in M1, hence smooth, PDF, unit mean, support in [0, ∞). Then ρ is defined in terms of f.\n\nTherefore, the Assumption section should list each of these points as separate lines:\n\nAssumption:\n- f is a smooth probability density function,\n- f has unit mean,\n- The support of f is contained in [0, ∞),\n- ρ(x) is defined as ∫_{z ≥ x} [(f * f)(z)/z] dz,\n- J(f) is defined as ∫₀^∞ x [f'(x)]² / f(x) dx.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the conjecture is that J(ρ) ≤ J(f). So, perhaps the problem statement is: Prove that for all f ∈ M1, J(ρ) ≤ J(f), where ρ is defined as...\n\nBut in the example provided by the user, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but the original problem didn't state that. Wait, no. Wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the user added an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but that seems to conflict. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect? Let me check.\n\nWait, the original problem in the example was:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems like an error. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That would be incorrect. So perhaps that example was a mistake. However, in the problem given here, we need to filter the original question's assumptions, not add new ones. So, in our current problem, we need to list the assumptions as given in the original question, not add new ones.\n\nWait, but in the example, the user added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. That seems incorrect. However, maybe that example was part of the user's own formatting, perhaps they made a mistake. But the instruction here is to structure the problem by filtering unrelated information and listing assumptions. So, in the current problem, we need to extract all the necessary conditions and structure them.\n\nSo, returning to the problem at hand. The user defines M1 as the space of smooth PDFs with unit mean and support in [0, ∞). So, the assumptions are:\n\n- f ∈ M1 (so f is smooth, PDF, unit mean, support in [0, ∞))\n- J(f) is defined as ∫₀^∞ x (f')² / f dx\n- ρ is defined as ∫_{z ≥ x} (f*f)(z)/z dz\n\nThe problem is to prove that J(ρ) ≤ J(f) for all f ∈ M1, or find a counterexample.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should list each condition for f, the definition of J, and the definition of ρ. Each of these should be separate lines in the assumption section.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\n- f is a smooth probability density function,\n- f has a unit mean,\n- The support of f is contained in [0, ∞),\n- J(f) is defined as ∫₀^∞ x [f'(x)]² / f(x) dx,\n- ρ(x) is defined as ∫_{z ≥ x} [(f * f)(z)/z] dz.\n\nProblem: Prove that J(ρ) ≤ J(f).\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user also mentioned that ρ is the law of U(X+Y), with U uniform, X and Y iid with law f. However, in the problem statement, they define ρ through the integral involving convolution. The motivation might not be part of the problem's assumptions but rather background. So, perhaps the formal problem doesn't require those probabilistic assumptions, as the definition of ρ is given analytically. Therefore, the assumptions should only include the analytical definitions, not the probabilistic motivation.\n\nTherefore, the problem is to prove that for f in M1 with the given assumptions, J(ρ) ≤ J(f), where ρ is defined via that integral. So, the assumptions are as above.\n\nWait, but let's check again. The original problem states:\n\n\"Define the following functional J(f):= ... for f ∈ M1. I am conjecturing that J(ρ) ≤ J(f) with ρ(x):= ...\"\n\nTherefore, the conjecture is for any f ∈ M1, where ρ is defined in terms of f. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. f is a smooth probability density function (since M1 consists of such functions).\n2. f has unit mean (∫ x f(x) dx = 1).\n3. The support of f is contained in [0, ∞).\n4. ρ is defined as the integral from z ≥ x of (f * f)(z)/z dz.\n5. J(f) is defined as the integral of x (f')² / f dx from 0 to ∞.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. So, each line in the Assumption section should state one of these.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n- f is a smooth probability density function,\n- f has unit mean,\n- The support of f is contained in [0, ∞),\n- ρ(x) is defined as ∫_{z ≥ x} [(f * f)(z)/z] dz,\n- J(f) is defined as ∫₀^∞ x [f'(x)]² / f(x) dx.\n\nProblem: Prove that J(ρ) ≤ J(f).\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"Prove that J(ρ) ≤ J(f) with ρ defined as...\". So the problem includes the definition of ρ. However, in the example given, the assumption includes the divisibility condition. So in this case, the problem statement would just be \"Prove that J(ρ) ≤ J(f)\", and the assumptions include the definitions and conditions.\n\nI think this is correct. Now, let me check if there are any other assumptions I might have missed. For instance, the convolution f*f is part of the definition of ρ. So, the assumption that ρ is defined via convolution of f with itself is important. So that's covered in the fourth assumption.\n\nAlso, the support being in [0, ∞) for f implies that f*f will have support in [0, ∞) as well, since the sum of two non-negative random variables is non-negative. But maybe that's an implicit property, but since the problem defines ρ in terms of f*f, it's part of the setup.\n\nTherefore, I think the above formatting captures all necessary assumptions. The problem is to prove the inequality given those assumptions.",
