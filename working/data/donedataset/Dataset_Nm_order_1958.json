    "Content": "If $A$ is a commutative ring with unity, then a fact proved in most commutative algebra textbooks is: $$\\dim A + 1\\leq\\dim A[X] \\leq 2\\dim A + 1$$ Idea of proof: each prime of $A$ in a chain can arise from at most two prime ideals of $A[X]$. The left equality holds when $A$ is a noetherian ring, but this paper of Seidenberg shows that, for rings of fixed dimension, every value in the interval is achievable. There seems to be a shortage of elementary references on these counterexamples, however, so I thought it might be good to collect some specific examples of commutative rings $A$ with $\\dim A[X] > \\dim A$, or knowledge about simple cases. In particular, it would be good to have some examples of rings $A$ with $\\dim A = 1$ and $\\dim A[X]=3$. Here is an example I just worked out, inspired by Seidenberg's paper. Let $k$ be a field, with $t$ transcendental over $k$, and let $A = \\{f\\in k(t)[[Y]] \\mid f(0) \\in k\\}$.  Then $A$ has unique nonzero prime ideal $P = \\{f\\in k(t)[[Y]] \\mid f(0) = 0\\}$, with $A/P \\cong k$, so $\\dim A = 1$. To see that $\\dim A[X]=3$, it is enough to exhibit a prime ideal lying between $(0)$ and $P[X]$.  Consider the map $A[X] \\to k(t)[[Y]]$ given by $p(X) \\mapsto p(t)$.  The image is an integral domain, so the kernel $K$ is prime.  But $(YX-tY)\\in K$, while $Y\\notin K$, so $(0)\\subsetneq K \\subsetneq P[X]$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here is a classification of all integral domains $A$ with $\\dim A=1$, $\\dim A[X]=3$: First, consider the map $\\operatorname{Spec} A[X]\\to\\operatorname{Spec} A$ given by $\\mathfrak{p}\\to\\mathfrak{p}\\cap A$.  The fiber over $P$ is isomorphic to $\\operatorname{Spec} A_P / PA_P\\otimes_A A[X] \\cong (A_P / PA_P)[X]$, which is one-dimensional.  It follows that a chain of three distinct primes in $A[X]$ cannot have the same intersection with $A$. Suppose that there is a chain of four prime ideals in $A[X]$.  By the previous paragraph, intersecting with $A$ must give us $(0)\\subset (0) \\subset P \\subset P$ for some maximal $P\\subset A$.  It follows that the first three elements of the chain are $(0) \\subsetneq \\mathfrak{q} \\subsetneq P[X]$, with $\\mathfrak{q}\\cap A = (0)$.  The existence of such a $\\mathfrak{q}$ is therefore equivalent to $\\dim A[X] = 3$. Then the map $A[X]\\to K(A[X]/\\mathfrak{q})$ restricts to an injection $A\\to K(A[X]/\\mathfrak{q})$, which induces an injection $K(A)\\to K(A[X]/\\mathfrak{q})$.  So $\\mathfrak{q}$ is the kernel of a map from $A[X]$ to a field extension of $K(A)$.  Let $t$ be the image of $X$ under this map. Since $\\mathfrak{q}\\neq (0)$, $t$ is algebraic over $K(A)$.  Since $\\mathfrak{q}\\subset P[X]$, $t$ is transcendental over $K(A/P)$. So all examples arise from a dimension $1$ integral domain $A$ with a maximal ideal $P$, such that there is some $t\\in \\overline{K(A)}$ that is transcendental over $K(A/P)$—i.e. every integral equation satisfied by $t$ has coefficients in $P$. (Note: In the original example, $t$ satisfies the polynomial $p(T) = YT - tY$, so this is probably close to the simplest example of an element of $K(A)$ transcendental over $K(A/P)$.) Conversely, such a $t$ gives rise to our desired prime ideal $\\mathfrak{q}$. Can the condition $t\\in \\overline{K(A)}$ be simplified to $t\\in K(A)$?  If so, the condition is much simpler: we must have some $t\\in K(A)$ that can only be written as a fraction with both numerator and denominator in $P$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this Math Stack Exchange question. The user is asking for examples of commutative rings A where the polynomial ring A[X] has a dimension larger than A's dimension. Specifically, they want a case where dim A = 1 and dim A[X] = 3. \n\nFirst, the original problem mentions that for a commutative ring with unity, the dimension of A[X] is between dim A +1 and 2 dim A +1. The user references Seidenberg's paper showing that all values in that interval are possible. But they're looking for concrete examples, particularly when dim A is 1 and dim A[X] is 3. \n\nThe example provided in the question involves a ring A constructed as follows: let k be a field, t transcendental over k, and A is the set of power series in k(t)[[Y]] such that f(0) is in k. The key points here are that A has a unique nonzero prime ideal P, which consists of those power series where f(0) = 0. The quotient A/P is isomorphic to k, so the dimension of A is 1. \n\nTo show that dim A[X] = 3, the user constructs a prime ideal between (0) and P[X]. They use a homomorphism from A[X] to k(t)[[Y]] by sending X to t. The kernel K of this map is prime. Since YX - tY is in K (because substituting X with t gives Yt - tY = 0) but Y is not in K, K is strictly between (0) and P[X]. This chain of primes (0) ⊂ K ⊂ P[X] ⊂ (some other prime?) would imply that the dimension is at least 3. But maybe there's more to verify here.\n\nSo the problem here is to show that the given ring A has dimension 1 and that A[X] has dimension 3. The assumptions would include the definition of A, properties of k and t, the structure of the prime ideals in A, and the construction of the kernel K. Let me list those assumptions one by one.\n\nAssumptions:\n1. A is the ring {f ∈ k(t)[[Y]] | f(0) ∈ k}, where k is a field and t is transcendental over k.\n2. P is the ideal {f ∈ A | f(0) = 0}.\n3. A/P is isomorphic to k.\n4. The dimension of A is 1.\n5. The homomorphism φ: A[X] → k(t)[[Y]] is defined by φ(p(X)) = p(t).\n6. The kernel K of φ is a prime ideal of A[X].\n7. YX - tY ∈ K.\n8. Y ∉ K.\n\nProblem: Prove that dim A[X] = 3.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user already worked out the example and is asking for other examples or knowledge. However, the user's question is about collecting specific examples where dim A[X] > dim A, especially when dim A=1 and dim A[X]=3. But the example provided by the user is their own, and they want to verify if that's correct. But maybe the way the user presents it is as a problem to be confirmed. Alternatively, the problem part here is to verify that dim A=1 and dim A[X]=3 based on the given construction. So the formatted problem would have those assumptions and ask to prove the dimensions. \n\nTherefore, the assumptions would list all the given conditions about the ring A, the ideal P, the field k, the transcendental element t, the homomorphism φ, and the kernel K. Then the problem would be to prove that dim A=1 and dim A[X]=3. However, in the original problem, the user says \"Here is an example I just worked out... To see that dim A[X] =3, it is enough...\" So maybe the problem is specifically to verify that dim A[X] =3 given the example. \n\nTherefore, the assumptions are the construction of A, the properties of A and P, and the problem is to show that dim A[X] =3. Alternatively, the problem could be split into two parts: first proving dim A=1, then dim A[X]=3. But the user's main focus is the latter. \n\nSo, structuring the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition. Let's see:\n\nAssumptions:\n- k is a field.\n- t is transcendental over k.\n- A = { f ∈ k(t)[[Y]] | f(0) ∈ k }.\n- P = { f ∈ A | f(0) = 0 }.\n- A/P ≅ k.\n- φ: A[X] → k(t)[[Y]] is the ring homomorphism defined by φ(p(X)) = p(t).\n- K is the kernel of φ.\n- YX - tY ∈ K.\n- Y ∉ K.\n\nProblem: Prove that dim A[X] = 3.\n\nWait, but the user already mentions that to see dim A[X] =3, it's enough to exhibit a prime ideal between (0) and P[X], which they do via K. So perhaps the problem is to confirm that this construction indeed leads to dim A[X] =3, i.e., that there's a chain of three primes. \n\nAlternatively, the problem as presented by the user is to \"collect some specific examples of commutative rings A with dim A[X] > dim A\", so maybe the problem is to provide such examples. But in the example given, the user already worked it out, so the problem would be to verify their example. \n\nBut according to the initial instructions, the task is to structure the problem as per the format, extracting assumptions and problem from the given question. The original question is asking for examples, but the example provided is part of the question. So the user's example might be presented as a problem. \n\nIn the example they provided, they constructed A and then tried to show dim A[X] =3. So the formatted problem would be to prove that dim A[X] =3 under the given assumptions. Therefore, the assumptions would include all the constructions (A, P, homomorphism, kernel properties), and the problem is to prove the dimension is 3. \n\nTherefore, each assumption line by line:\n\n- A is the ring { f ∈ k(t)[[Y]] | f(0) ∈ k }, where k is a field.\n- t is an element transcendental over k.\n- P is the ideal { f ∈ A | f(0) = 0 }.\n- The quotient ring A/P is isomorphic to k.\n- The homomorphism φ: A[X] → k(t)[[Y]] is defined by φ(p(X)) = p(t).\n- The kernel K of φ is a prime ideal of A[X].\n- The element YX - tY is in K.\n- The element Y is not in K.\n\nProblem: Prove that the Krull dimension of A[X] is 3.\n\nAlternatively, since the user's example states that A has dim 1 and wants to show A[X] has dim 3, perhaps the problem is split into two parts. But the example explanation already shows that A has dim 1, so maybe the main problem is proving that A[X] has dim 3. However, in the formatted example given initially (the A(n) divisible by 91), the problem included both the divisibility by 91 and the assumptions. Here, perhaps the assumptions include that A is a ring of dimension 1 (since they already showed that), and then the problem is to prove that A[X] has dimension 3. But according to the user's own explanation, they need to show the existence of a prime between 0 and P[X], so the problem is to verify this step leads to dim A[X] =3. \n\nSo putting it all together, the assumptions would include all the setup (definition of A, P, k, t, φ, K, properties of K), and the problem is to conclude that dim A[X] is 3. \n\nBut maybe the problem is as presented in the user's example: given A as defined, prove that dim A =1 and dim A[X] =3. But since the user's question is asking for examples where dim A[X] > dim A, and in this case, dim A=1 and dim A[X]=3, which satisfies the inequality. \n\nBut the way the user presents their example: they first define A, show dim A=1, then to see dim A[X]=3, they need to show the chain. So the problem would be in two parts: first showing dim A=1, then showing dim A[X]=3. However, the example explanation already outlines the steps. \n\nBut following the initial example given (the A(n) divisible by 91), the assumptions were that n is an integer and divisible by 7, and the problem is to prove A(n) divisible by 91. So in this case, the user's problem is presented as an example, so we need to structure it as assumptions (the setup of the ring A, the properties given) and the problem (prove that dim A[X] =3). \n\nSo the key assumptions here are:\n\n- k is a field.\n- t is transcendental over k.\n- A = { f ∈ k(t)[[Y]] | f(0) ∈ k }.\n- P is the unique nonzero prime ideal of A, defined as { f ∈ A | f(0) = 0 }.\n- A/P ≅ k, so dim A = 1.\n- The homomorphism φ: A[X] → k(t)[[Y]] sending X to t has kernel K.\n- K is a prime ideal with YX - tY ∈ K and Y ∉ K.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that dim A[X] = 3.\n\nBut to list each assumption line by line, addressing one property per line:\n\nAssumption:\n- $k$ is a field.\n- $t$ is transcendental over $k$.\n- $A = \\{ f \\in k(t)[[Y]] \\mid f(0) \\in k \\}$.\n- $P = \\{ f \\in A \\mid f(0) = 0 \\}$.\n- $A/P$ is isomorphic to $k$.\n- The Krull dimension of $A$ is $1$.\n- The map $\\phi: A[X] \\to k(t)[[Y]]$ defined by $\\phi(p(X)) = p(t)$ is a ring homomorphism.\n- The kernel $K$ of $\\phi$ is a prime ideal of $A[X]$.\n- $(YX - tY) \\in K$.\n- $Y \\notin K$.\n\nProblem: Prove that the Krull dimension of $A[X]$ is $3$.\n\nWait, but in the example, the user says \"it is enough to exhibit a prime ideal lying between (0) and P[X]\". So the problem is to show that such a prime exists, hence leading to the dimension being 3. So maybe the problem is to show that dim A[X] ≥ 3, but since the upper bound is 2*1 +1 =3, so equality holds. Therefore, the problem is to show that dim A[X] =3.\n\nYes, that's correct. So structuring the assumptions and problem accordingly.",
