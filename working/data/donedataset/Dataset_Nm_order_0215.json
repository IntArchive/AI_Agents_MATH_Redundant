    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the user's format. First, I need to read the original question carefully. The user wants to prove that the integral from 0 to infinity of 1/(1+x^n) dx equals pi/(n sin(pi/n)) using only real analysis techniques. The original proof used complex analysis, so the challenge is to do it without that.\n\nLet me start by listing the assumptions. The problem mentions that n is a positive natural number excluding 1. The integral is from 0 to infinity, and the function is 1/(1+x^n). The user also mentions a more general result involving a and b, but the specific problem here is about the case where the numerator is x^0 (since it's 1) and the denominator is x^n +1. So for the specific problem, a would be 1, and b would be n, but in the general case, a must be between 0 and b. However, in the given problem, since the integral is 1/(1+x^n), the exponent in the numerator is x^(0), so a-1 = 0 implies a=1. Therefore, the conditions would be 0 < a=1 < b=n. So n must be greater than 1, which aligns with the original problem's n in N^+ \\ {1}.\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n1. The integral is from 0 to infinity.\n2. The integrand is 1/(1 + x^n).\n3. n is a positive integer.\n4. n is greater than 1 (since it's excluded).\n5. The proof must use real analysis techniques only.\n\nWait, the problem states n ∈ N^+ \\ {1}, so n is a natural number greater than 1. So the assumptions should capture that. Let me list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The integral is computed over the interval [0, ∞).\n- The integrand is 1/(1 + x^n).\n- n is a positive integer.\n- n is greater than 1.\n- The proof must use real analysis techniques (excluding complex analysis).\n\nBut the user's example had assumptions like \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". So each assumption is a single condition. So in this case, each bullet point would be a separate assumption. However, \"n is a positive integer greater than 1\" could be split into two: \"n is a positive integer\" and \"n is greater than 1\". However, in the original problem statement, the user says \"n ∈ N^+ \\ {1}\", which combines both, but to follow the format, maybe split them. Let me check the example again. In the example, they had two separate lines: \"$n$ is an integer\", \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". So yes, split them.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nn is greater than 1,\nthe integral is evaluated from 0 to ∞,\nthe integrand is 1/(1 + x^n),\nthe proof uses real analysis techniques only.\n\nWait, the last one is a condition on the proof method, not on the mathematical objects. The original example didn't include proof method as an assumption. The example's assumptions were about the problem's conditions. So maybe the proof method is part of the problem statement, not the assumption. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. The assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. The problem then is to prove divisibility by 91. So the proof method isn't part of the assumptions. So in this case, the requirement to use real analysis techniques is part of the problem, not an assumption. Therefore, the problem statement would include that constraint.\n\nSo adjusting:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nn is greater than 1,\nthe integral is evaluated from 0 to ∞,\nthe integrand is 1/(1 + x^n).\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{dx}{1+x^n} = \\frac{\\pi}{n \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right)}$$ using real analysis techniques only.\n\nBut wait, the original problem mentions \"for n ∈ N^+ \\ {1}\" which translates to n being a positive integer greater than 1. So the assumptions should reflect that. Also, the integrand is 1/(1+x^n), integral from 0 to infinity.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have assumptions as:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nn is greater than 1,\nthe integral is evaluated over the interval [0, ∞),\nthe integrand is 1/(1 + x^n).\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{dx}{1+x^n} = \\frac{\\pi}{n \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right)}$$ using real analysis techniques only.\n\nI think that's correct. Each assumption is a single condition. The problem includes the requirement to use real analysis. The original question mentions that they already have a complex analysis proof, so the problem is to do it with real methods. That constraint is part of the problem statement, not an assumption on the mathematical objects. So yes, that should be in the problem line.",
