    "Content": "While grading some papers and thinking about a question related to well-orders (in particular, pointing a mistake in a solution), I came to think of a reasonable characterization for well-orders. I can immediately see it's true for countable orders, but not for uncountable orders. Definition. Let $\\cal L$ be a first-order language, and $\\cal M$ an $\\cal L$-structure. We say that $\\cal M$ is rigid if $\\text{Aut}(\\cal M)=\\{\\rm id\\}$. Conjecture. Let $\\cal L=\\{<\\}$. Then $\\mathcal M=\\langle M,<\\rangle$ is rigid if and only if it is a well-order or its reverse order is a well-order. One direction is trivial. Well-orders are rigid (and therefore their reversed orders are rigid as well). In the other direction, if $\\cal M$ is countable, then it is easy. Suppose it's not a well-order. If $\\cal M$ contains a convex copy of $\\Bbb Z$ then fix everything else and shift that copy by $1$. Otherwise $\\cal M$ contains a convex copy of $\\Bbb Q$ and then we can shift that copy by $1$ (or multiply it by $\\frac12$, whatever floats your boat). The problem is that for uncountable order types the plot thickens and they might be $\\kappa$-dense, so neither of the arguments would work (and there is no additive structure - that I know of - that we can exploit like in the countable case). Question: Does the conjecture hold, or is there some intricate counterexample?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The conjecture does not hold. For a simple counterexample, consider $\\omega+\\omega^*$. In fact, there are rather dramatic counterexamples: In this answer , Brian M. Scott refers to B. M. Scott. A characterization of well-orders , Fundamenta Mathematicæ, 111 (1) , 71-76. MR0607921 (82i:06001) , where he proves that for every infinite $\\kappa$ with $2^{<\\kappa}=\\kappa$ there is a rigid dense linear order of size $2^\\kappa$. Moreover, this order does not even admit order-preserving injections into itself other than the identity. For $\\kappa=\\omega$, this is a result of Dushnik and Miller, who even built such a set as a dense subset of the reals. This is Theorem 9.1 of Joseph G. Rosenstein. Linear orderings , Pure and Applied Mathematics, 98. Academic Press, Inc. [Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, Publishers], New York-London, 1982. MR0662564 (84m:06001) . For an additional example, in his answer, Brian also mentions the set\n $$ X=\\{(n,\\alpha)\\mid n\\in\\omega\\,\\&\\,\\alpha\\in\\omega_n\\},$$\nordered by $(m,\\alpha)\\le(n,\\beta)$ iff $m>n$ (as natural numbers), or else $m=n$ and $\\alpha\\le \\beta$ (as ordinals). This order is rigid, and neither a well-order, nor a reverse well-order. In his paper, Brian also characterizes well-orders: Say that a linear order $(X,<)$ is cushioned iff every order preserving injection $f:X\\to X$ satisfies $x\\le f(x)$ for all $x$. Theorem. A linear order $(X,<)$ is a well-order iff it is cushioned and scattered. There is a related notion of rigidity, where we require $(X,<)$ to be rigid iff it admits no isomorphism with a proper initial segment of itself. This notion has been studied by John L. Hickman, see J. L. Hickman. Rigidity in order-types , J. Austral. Math. Soc. Ser. A, 24 (2) , (1977), 203–215. MR0480217 (58 #397) .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is talking about a characterization of well-orders through rigidity. The conjecture is that a linear order is rigid if and only if it's a well-order or the reverse of a well-order.\n\nFirst, the assumptions. The language is {<}, so we're dealing with linear orders. The structure M is an L-structure here, which means it's a linear order. The problem mentions rigidity, so Aut(M) is trivial. The user is asking whether the conjecture holds: rigid linear orders are exactly the well-orders or their reverses. The example they give for countable orders works, but they're unsure about uncountable ones.\n\nSo the assumptions would include that the structure is a linear order (since L is {<}), that it's rigid (Aut(M) is trivial), and the problem is to determine if such a structure must be a well-order or its reverse. The original problem's question is whether the conjecture holds or if there's a counterexample, especially in uncountable cases.\n\nWait, but in the example provided, the assumption included specific conditions on n. Here, the main objects are the structure M and the order. So the assumptions would be about M being a linear order, rigidity, and the conjecture's equivalence. But in the problem statement, the user is asking whether the conjecture holds, so maybe the problem is to prove or disprove the conjecture. The assumptions for the problem would then be the conditions given in the conjecture. Let me list each assumption line by line.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The language L is {<}.\n- M is an L-structure, i.e., a linear order ⟨M, <⟩.\n- M is rigid (Aut(M) = {id}).\n- The problem is to determine if M being rigid implies that it is a well-order or its reverse is a well-order.\n\nWait, but the conjecture is an equivalence. The problem statement is: M is rigid iff it is a well-order or its reverse. So the problem is to prove or disprove this conjecture. Therefore, the assumptions are the conditions given in the conjecture. Let me structure them:\n\nAssumption:\nL is the first-order language containing only the relation symbol <.\nM is an L-structure, i.e., a linearly ordered set ⟨M, <⟩.\nM is rigid (has no non-trivial automorphisms).\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that M is a well-order or the reverse of a well-order.\n\nBut the original problem also mentions the reverse direction being trivial (well-orders are rigid), but the other direction (rigid implies well-order or reverse) is the question. So the problem is to show that if a linear order is rigid, then it must be a well-order or its reverse is a well-order. Alternatively, find a counterexample.\n\nSo formatting according to the user's example, the assumptions should list each condition. Let me check the example again. In the example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7. Wait, no. Wait, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem in the example added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which actually wasn't in the original problem. Wait, that might have been a mistake. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Hmm, maybe the example was a bad example. But in this case, the user's example might be wrong, but I need to follow the instructions regardless.\n\nWait, the user says: \"filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" So perhaps in the example, the original problem had an error, and the formatted problem corrected it by adding the assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", and the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That contradicts. Maybe the example is wrong, but the user wants me to follow their format. So in this case, the task is to list the assumptions of the problem, each as a single line, applied to one object.\n\nIn the current problem, the conjecture is: Let L = {<}, then M is rigid iff it is a well-order or its reverse is a well-order. So the problem is to prove or disprove this. The assumptions here would be that L is {<}, M is an L-structure (so a linear order), and M is rigid. The problem is to prove that M is a well-order or reverse well-order. Alternatively, since the conjecture is an equivalence, but the user is focusing on the non-trivial direction (rigid implies well-order or reverse), the problem might be stated as such.\n\nBut the user's example shows that in their formatted problem, they took the original problem (which had for every integer n) and restructured with assumptions including n being divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. That suggests that perhaps the example is incorrect, but maybe the user intended to include all given conditions as assumptions. But the original problem didn't have the divisibility by 7, but the formatted problem added it. That's confusing. Maybe the user made a mistake in their example. But regardless, I need to follow their instructions.\n\nSo for the current problem: the original question is whether the conjecture holds. The conjecture is: For L = {<}, M is rigid iff it is a well-order or its reverse. So the problem is to prove or disprove that. The assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe language L is {<}.\nM is an L-structure (i.e., a linearly ordered set ⟨M, <⟩).\nM is rigid (Aut(M) is trivial).\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that M is a well-order or the reverse of a well-order.\n\nBut the problem as posed in the original question is \"Does the conjecture hold, or is there some intricate counterexample?\" So they want to know if the conjecture is true or false. Therefore, the problem is to determine the validity of the conjecture, i.e., prove or disprove that a rigid linear order must be a well-order or its reverse.\n\nTherefore, structuring as per the user's example, the assumptions are each line: the language, the structure being a linear order, the rigidity. Then the problem is the conjecture's statement.",
