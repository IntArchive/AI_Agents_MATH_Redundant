    "Content": "I'm thinking about Hausdorff spaces, and how mappings to Hausdorff spaces behave. Suppose I have an arbitrary (continuous) function $f:X \\longrightarrow Y$, where $Y$ is a Hausdorff space (I think it is irrelevant for my question whether $X$ is Hausdorff or not, so I just consider it to be a topological space - if this is incorrect, please correct me!). Can we say that the graph $$G_f=\\{(x,f(x)) \\in X \\times Y\\ : x \\in X \\}$$ is a closed subset of $X \\times Y$? It seems quite obvious that it is the case, but I cannot see how to prove it. If anyone can offer a proof I'd be very interested. Regards. EDIT 1 In response to Hennning Makholm: I wasn't really aware of any variation in 'definition'; I guess I'm considering closed sets to be those with an open complement (though naturally this definition gives rise to other definitions, such as the subset equalling its closure etc.). For continuity of such a map, I would normally consider continuity to mean that $f^{-1}(V)$ is closed in $X$ whenever $V$ is closed in $Y$, though again definitions involving convergence of sequences and the notion that $f$ is continuous iff $f(\\overline{A}) \\subset \\overline{f(A)}$ for every $A \\subset X$ are also known to me.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Suppose that $\\langle x,y\\rangle\\in (X\\times Y)\\setminus G_f$. Then $y\\ne f(x)$, and $Y$ is Hausdorff, so there are disjoint open $U,V$ in $Y$ such that $y\\in U$ and $f(x)\\in V$. Since $f$ is continuous, there is an open nbhd $W$ of $x$ such that $f[W]\\subseteq V$; clearly $W\\times U$ is an open nbhd of $\\langle x,y\\rangle$ disjoint from $G_f$. It is necessary to require that $Y$ be Hausdorff. For a simple example, let $X=\\{0,1\\}$ have the discrete topology, and let $Y=\\{0,1\\}$ with the Sierpiński topology, whose open sets are $\\varnothing,\\{0\\}$, and $Y$ itself. Let $f:X\\to Y$ be the identity function; $f$ is certainly continuous, since $X$ is discrete, but $\\langle 0,1\\rangle$ is in the closure of $G_f$, since every nbhd of $\\langle 0,1\\rangle$ contains $\\langle 0,0\\rangle$. Added: The space $Y$ in that example is $T_0$ but not $T_1$; here’s an example in which $Y$ is $T_1$. Let $X=\\mathbb{N}\\cup\\{p\\}$, where $p\\notin\\mathbb{N}$, and let $Y=\\mathbb{N}\\cup\\{p,q\\}$, where $q\\notin\\mathbb{N}$ and $p\\ne q$. In both $X$ and $Y$ the points of $\\mathbb{N}$ are isolated, and in both $X$ and $Y$ a local base at $p$ consists of all sets of the form $\\{p\\}\\cup(\\mathbb{N}\\setminus F)$ such that $F$ is a finite subset of $\\mathbb{N}$. Finally, a local base at $q$ in $Y$ consists of all sets of the form $\\{q\\}\\cup(\\mathbb{N}\\setminus F)$ such that $F$ is a finite subset of $\\mathbb{N}$. The points $p$ and $q$ in $Y$ do not have disjoint open nbhds; they are the only pair of points in $Y$ that cannot be separated by disjoint open sets. Let $f:X\\to Y:x\\mapsto x$ be the identity function; it’s easy to see that $f$ is not just continuous, but an embedding. The point $\\langle p,q\\rangle\\in X\\times Y$ is not in $G_f$, but you can check that if $U$ is an open nbhd of $\\langle p,q\\rangle$ in $X\\times Y$, then there is an $m\\in\\mathbb{N}$ such that $\\langle n,n\\rangle\\in U$ whenever $n\\ge m$, so $U\\cap G_f\\ne\\varnothing$. Thus, $\\langle p,q\\rangle$ is in the closure of $G_f$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user is asking whether the graph of a continuous function from a topological space X to a Hausdorff space Y is closed in the product space X × Y. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions clearly. The problem mentions that f is continuous, Y is Hausdorff, and X is a topological space (they're unsure if X being Hausdorff matters, but according to their statement, it's not required). So the assumptions should include that f is continuous, Y is Hausdorff, and X is any topological space.\n\nWait, the original question says \"arbitrary (continuous) function f: X → Y\". So the continuity of f is given. Also, Y is Hausdorff. The user is questioning if under these conditions, the graph G_f is closed in X × Y. \n\nI need to make sure each assumption is listed separately. So the assumptions are:\n\n1. f is a continuous function from X to Y.\n2. Y is a Hausdorff space.\n3. X is a topological space (they mentioned it might not matter if X is Hausdorff, so just stating it's a topological space as given).\n\nWait, the user initially thought whether X is Hausdorff is irrelevant. But in the problem statement, they just have X as a topological space. So the key assumptions here are the continuity of f and Y being Hausdorff. X's property is just a topological space without any specific separation axiom. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- f: X → Y is continuous.\n- Y is a Hausdorff space.\n- X is a topological space.\n\nEach of these is a separate condition applied to different objects (f applies to the function, Y applies to the space, X applies to the domain). \n\nThe problem then is to prove that G_f is closed in X × Y. \n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property. So following that structure, I should list each assumption separately. \n\nI should also check if there are any other implicit assumptions. For instance, the graph being defined as a subset of X × Y is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. The problem is to show that this subset is closed. \n\nSo the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a continuous function from X to Y,\nY is a Hausdorff space,\nX is a topological space.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the graph $$G_f=\\{(x,f(x)) \\in X \\times Y\\ : x \\in X \\}$$ is a closed subset of $X \\times Y$.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user says \"arbitrary (continuous) function f\". So the continuity is part of the assumption. Also, Y being Hausdorff is another assumption. X is a topological space. So those three are the key assumptions.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is one line. So each line is a separate assumption. So:\n\nAssumption:\n$f: X \\to Y$ is continuous,\n$Y$ is a Hausdorff space,\n$X$ is a topological space.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the graph $G_f = \\{(x, f(x)) \\in X \\times Y : x \\in X\\}$ is a closed subset of $X \\times Y$.\n\nYes, that seems correct. The user also mentioned in their edit about different definitions of continuity, but since the problem assumes f is continuous, the specific definition (closed preimages vs closure properties) might not be necessary unless the proof hinges on a particular one, but the assumptions just state f is continuous, so the specific definition isn't part of the assumptions. The key is that f is continuous and Y is Hausdorff. X being any topological space is another assumption. So that's all.",
