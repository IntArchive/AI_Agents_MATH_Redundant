    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question according to the specified structure. The example provided shows that assumptions should list each condition on one line, applied to one object, and then the problem statement.\n\nFirst, I need to read the original problem carefully. The problem is an inequality involving a sum from 1/(2√2 +1) up to 1/(100√100 +99√99), and the goal is to show that this sum is less than 9/10. The user also mentions a possible shortcut based on the inequality a√a + b√b ≥ a√b + b√a, which was proven using (a - b)(√a - √b) ≥ 0. However, in the example given by the user, the assumption part included specific conditions like n being an integer and divisible by 7. \n\nLooking at the current problem, the original question doesn't explicitly state any assumptions beyond the general structure of the terms in the series. Each term in the sum is of the form 1/[(k+1)√(k+1) + k√k], where k starts from 1 and goes up to 99 (since the last term is 100√100 +99√99). However, the problem doesn't specify any restrictions on k or the terms beyond their general form. The key here is that the problem is about summing these specific fractions and proving the inequality.\n\nThe user's example for the divisibility problem included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the problem's original statement. In the current problem, the only assumption is the structure of each term in the series. Since the problem is about the sum from k=1 to 99 of 1/[(k+1)√(k+1) + k√k], the assumptions would be about the form of each term. However, the problem as stated doesn't have additional conditions like specific values or divisibility; it's a straightforward inequality proof. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem assumes that each term is positive, which they are because denominators are sums of positive terms. But since that's inherent in the structure (all terms are positive real numbers), maybe the assistant should list that as an assumption. However, in the example provided, the assumptions were specific conditions given in the problem. The original problem here doesn't state any assumptions beyond the series structure, so maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond the terms being defined as such. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might have an implicit assumption that k is a positive integer from 1 to 99, which defines the terms of the series. Each term corresponds to consecutive integers k and k+1. So the assumptions would be that each term in the sum is of the form 1/[(k+1)√(k+1) + k√k] where k is an integer, k ≥ 1, and k ≤ 99. But in the example, the assumption was simply that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So following that style, maybe here the assumptions are:\n\nEach term in the sum is of the form 1/[(k+1)√(k+1) + k√k},\nk is an integer,\nk ranges from 1 to 99.\n\nBut the problem statement itself already specifies the sum from the first term (2√2 +1) up to 100√100 +99√99, which corresponds to k from 1 to 99. Therefore, the problem as stated includes the range. However, the example's assumption listed \"n is an integer\" even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So perhaps here, the key assumptions are:\n\nEach term is of the form 1/[(k+1)√(k+1) + k√k},\nk is a positive integer,\nk takes values from 1 to 99 inclusive.\n\nBut maybe the problem doesn't require listing these as separate assumptions because they are part of the problem's structure. However, in the example, the assumption was explicitly stated even though the original problem mentioned \"for every integer n\". So following that example, it's better to list each assumption line by line. Therefore:\n\nAssumption: Each term in the sum is of the form 1/[(k+1)√(k+1) + k√k} for some integer k,\nk is a positive integer,\nk ranges from 1 to 99.\n\nWait, but the example had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. However, in the original problem here, there's no such condition. The problem is about summing terms from k=1 to k=99. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nEach term is of the form 1/[(k+1)√(k+1) + k√k},\nk is an integer,\nk ≥ 1,\nk ≤ 99.\n\nBut the problem statement already says \"2√2 +1\" which is k=1, then \"3√3 +2√2\" which is k=2, up to \"100√100 +99√99\" which is k=99. So the sum is from k=1 to k=99. Therefore, the assumptions are inherent in the problem statement. However, the example included the conditions on n even though they were part of the problem's original statement. Hence, following the example's structure, the assumptions here should be:\n\nk is an integer,\nk ranges from 1 to 99,\neach term in the sum is 1/[(k+1)√(k+1) + k√k}.\n\nBut perhaps the problem as stated doesn't have any explicit assumptions beyond the terms being structured as such. The problem is to sum those terms and show the inequality. Therefore, maybe there are no explicit assumptions to list beyond what's given in the problem statement. However, the example included assumptions even when they were part of the problem's original phrasing. So to adhere to the format, perhaps list the components that are necessary for the problem's setup.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key assumption is that each term is positive, but that's obvious. The example didn't list that as an assumption. So perhaps in this case, the problem doesn't have additional assumptions beyond the terms being structured as given. But the example included \"n is an integer\" even though the problem stated \"for every integer n\". So following that, the assumptions here would be:\n\nEach term in the sum is of the form 1/[(k+1)√(k+1) + k√k} where k is a positive integer,\nThe sum is taken from k=1 to k=99.\n\nBut the problem statement already includes the sum's limits. However, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which was split into an assumption that n is an integer. So translating that here, the problem's sum is over terms from k=1 to 99, so the assumptions would be:\n\nk is an integer,\nk is in the range 1 ≤ k ≤ 99,\neach term is 1/[(k+1)√(k+1) + k√k}.\n\nTherefore, structuring the problem accordingly. Let's check the example again: the original problem had \"for every integer n\", which became \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. Then another assumption was \"n is divisible by 7\" which was part of the original problem's actual conditions (the user might have made a mistake here, but in the example provided, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem listed n divisible by 7 as an assumption. But wait, the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7; the formatted problem in the example added that as an assumption. Wait, that seems off. Wait, the original problem was:\n\nOriginal problem:\nProve that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nBut the formatted problem lists assumptions as n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that's incorrect. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the formatted problem should not have \"n is divisible by 7\" unless the problem was to prove divisibility by 91 under the condition that n is divisible by 7. Wait, perhaps there was a mistake in the example. If the original problem states \"for every integer n\", then the assumption should just be that n is an integer. Adding \"n is divisible by 7\" would be an extra condition not present in the original problem. That suggests that perhaps the example provided by the user is incorrect. However, since the user provided that example as a guide, we have to follow their structure even if it's flawed.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question doesn't have any explicit conditions like divisibility, but it's about a sum from k=1 to 99 of terms structured as 1/[(k+1)√(k+1) + k√k}. Therefore, following the user's example, we need to list the assumptions as:\n\nAssumption: Each term in the sum is of the form 1/[(k+1)√(k+1) + k√k},\nk is an integer,\nk ranges from 1 to 99.\n\nProblem: Prove that the sum of these terms is less than 9/10.\n\nBut the problem as stated in the original question is:\n\nProve that (sum from term 1/(2√2 +1) up to 1/(100√100 +99√99)) < 9/10.\n\nSo translating that into the Problem section, keeping the original inequality.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nEach term in the sum is of the form $\\frac{1}{(k+1)\\sqrt{k+1} + k\\sqrt{k}}$,\n$k$ is an integer,\n$k$ ranges from 1 to 99.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}+1}+\\frac{1}{3\\sqrt{3}+2\\sqrt{2}}+\\cdots+\\frac{1}{100\\sqrt{100}+99\\sqrt{99}}<\\frac{9}{10}.$$\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were listed as separate lines, each addressing one property. So each assumption line here would be:\n\n- Each term in the sum is of the form $\\frac{1}{(k+1)\\sqrt{k+1} + k\\sqrt{k}}$,\n- $k$ is an integer,\n- $k$ ranges from 1 to 99.\n\nHowever, the original problem doesn't explicitly state that k is an integer or the range; it's inferred from the sum's terms. But following the example's structure, we should list those as assumptions. So that's the formatted version.",
