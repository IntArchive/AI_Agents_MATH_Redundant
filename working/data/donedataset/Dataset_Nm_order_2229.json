    "Content": "Let $a,b,c,d$ be positive integers such that $a^2+3ab+b^2=c^2+3cd+d^2$ . Prove that $a+b+c+d$ is a composite number. I think this statement is correct, at least using the program I came across only composite numbers. An approximate solution plan is as follows: The equality $(2a+3b)^2-5b^2=(2c+d)^2-5d^2$ holds. We can factor it in the ring $\\mathbb Z[\\sqrt5]$ . It is not a UFD, but it is reasonable to assume that there is a further factorization in a wider area - involving what Kummer called \"ideal numbers\". From here, maybe some information about the coefficients can be extracted. Any ideas?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Suppose $p:= a+b+c+d$ is a prime. Since $d=p-a-b-c$ we have: $$a^2+3ab+b^2 = c^2+3pc-3ac-3bc-3c^2+p^2-2p(a+b+c)+a^2+b^2+c^2+2ab+2bc+2ca$$ i.e. $$ab+ ac+bc+c^2=p^2-p(2a+2b-c)$$ or $$(a+c)(b+c) = p(p-2a-2b+c)$$ Last equation implies $p\\mid a+c$ or $p\\mid b+c$ . In each case we have a contradiction, since $p$ is greater then $a+c$ and $b+c$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the user's format. First, I need to read the original question carefully and extract the key information.\n\nThe problem states: Let a, b, c, d be positive integers such that a² + 3ab + b² = c² + 3cd + d². Prove that a + b + c + d is a composite number.\n\nThe user provided an example where they listed assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So, I need to list all the assumptions from the problem here.\n\nFirst, the variables a, b, c, d are all positive integers. That's four separate assumptions, each stating that a, b, c, d are positive integers. Wait, but the example given by the user had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate lines. So maybe each variable being a positive integer should be separate lines. But the original problem mentions \"positive integers\" collectively. Hmm, the example had \"n is an integer\" as one assumption, so perhaps here it's acceptable to list \"a, b, c, d are positive integers\" as a single assumption since they're all covered under the same condition. But wait, the user's instruction says each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So maybe each variable should be listed individually. But the problem states \"positive integers\" for all four variables. Maybe it's better to list each variable as a separate assumption? Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the user wrote \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as two separate assumptions. So each assumption is about one property. Here, the problem states that a, b, c, d are positive integers. So perhaps each variable being a positive integer should be separate. But that would result in four assumptions: a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, etc. However, in mathematical problems, it's common to group variables of the same type. Maybe the user allows grouping if they share the same condition. Alternatively, perhaps the problem's main equation is another assumption. Wait, the equation a² + 3ab + b² = c² + 3cd + d² is a condition that must be included as an assumption.\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n1. a is a positive integer.\n2. b is a positive integer.\n3. c is a positive integer.\n4. d is a positive integer.\n5. The equation a² + 3ab + b² = c² + 3cd + d² holds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe group the first four as one assumption: a, b, c, d are positive integers. But the example separated \"n is an integer\" into its own line. Hmm, but in the example, the problem had only one variable, n. Here there are four variables. The instruction says \"each assumption addresses only one property or condition, applied to one object.\" So \"one object\" could mean each variable is an object. Therefore, each variable being a positive integer is a separate assumption. So four assumptions for a, b, c, d each being positive integers, and then the fifth assumption is the equation. But that might be excessive. Alternatively, maybe the problem considers \"a, b, c, d are positive integers\" as a single assumption. Let me check the example again. In the example, the first assumption was \"n is an integer,\" which is a single line. So if there are multiple variables with the same condition, perhaps they can be grouped. Therefore, the first assumption would be \"a, b, c, d are positive integers,\" and the second assumption is the equation given. But the user's instruction says each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. Wait, maybe \"one object\" here refers to a single mathematical object, like a variable or an equation. So for variables a, b, c, d, each being a positive integer is four separate assumptions. Then the equation as a fifth assumption. But I'm not sure. The example didn't have that because the example only had one variable. Let me think again. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Both applied to n. Here, the variables are four, so perhaps each being positive integers can be grouped into one assumption. Alternatively, maybe each is separate. Since the example grouped \"n is an integer\" as one line, perhaps here we can group \"a, b, c, d are positive integers\" as one assumption. Then the equation as another assumption. That would make two assumptions. But the user might prefer splitting variables. Alternatively, the original problem states \"Let a,b,c,d be positive integers such that...\" So maybe the two main assumptions are that a,b,c,d are positive integers and the equation holds. Therefore, two assumptions. But according to the user's instruction, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. Wait, perhaps \"a, b, c, d are positive integers\" is one assumption (applied to the set of variables), and the equation is another. But maybe the user expects each variable to be listed individually. However, in the example, they didn't split n into multiple assumptions. So perhaps the answer should be:\n\nAssumption:\na, b, c, d are positive integers,\na² + 3ab + b² = c² + 3cd + d².\n\nProblem:\nProve that a + b + c + d is a composite number.\n\nBut let me check if that's sufficient. The original problem doesn't have any other conditions. So those two assumptions: the variables are positive integers, and the equation holds. The problem is to prove the sum is composite. That seems correct. The example had two assumptions as well. So I think this is acceptable. The user's example grouped \"n is an integer\" as one assumption and another condition as the second. Similarly here, grouping the variables as one assumption and the equation as another. Therefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\na, b, c, d are positive integers,\na² + 3ab + b² = c² + 3cd + d².\n\nProblem:\nProve that a + b + c + d is a composite number.\n\nI think that's correct. The rest of the question's details, like the user's attempt to factor it in the ring Z[√5], are part of their solution attempt, which we can ignore when structuring the problem. Our task is to extract the problem's assumptions and the problem statement itself. Therefore, the final answer should follow this structure.",
