    "Content": "Let $A$ be the $n\\times n$ matrix given by $$A_{ij}=\\frac{1}{i + j - 1}$$ Show that $A$ is invertible and that the inverse has integer entries. I was able to show that $A$ is invertible. How do I show that $A^{-1}$ has integer entries? This matrix is called the Hilbert matrix. The problem appears as exercise 12 in section 1.6 of Hoffman and Kunze's Linear Algebra (2nd edition).",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Be wise, generalize (c) I think the nicest way to answer this question is the direct computation of the inverse - however, for a more general matrix including the Hilbert matrix as a special case. The corresponding formulas have very transparent structure and nontrivial further generalizations. The matrix $A$ is a particular case of the so-called Cauchy matrix with elements \n$$A_{ij}=\\frac{1}{x_i-y_j},\\qquad i,j=1,\\ldots, N.$$ \nNamely, in the Hilbert case we can take\n$$x_i=i-\\frac{1}{2},\\qquad y_i=-i+\\frac12.$$\nThe determinant of $A$ is given in the general case by\n$$\\mathrm{det}\\,A=\\frac{\\prod_{1\\leq i<j\\leq N}(x_i-x_j)(y_j-y_i)}{\\prod_{1\\leq i,j\\leq N}(x_i-y_j)}.\\tag{1}$$\n Up to an easily computable constant prefactor, the structure of (1) follows from the observation that $\\mathrm{det}\\,A$ vanishes whenever there is a pair of coinciding $x$'s or $y$'s. (In the latter case $A$ contains a pair of coinciding raws/columns). For our $x$'s and $y$'s the determinant is clearly non-zero, hence $A$ is invertible. One can also easily find the inverse $A^{-1}$, since the matrix obtained from a Cauchy matrix by deleting one row and one column is also of Cauchy type, with one $x$ and one $y$ less. Taking the ratio of the corresponding two determinants and using (1), most of the factors cancel out and one obtains\n\\begin{align}\nA_{mn}^{-1}=\\frac{1}{y_m-x_n}\\frac{\\prod_{1\\leq i\\leq N}(x_n-y_i)\\cdot\\prod_{1\\leq i\\leq N}(y_m-x_i)}{\\prod_{i\\neq n}(x_n-x_i)\\cdot\\prod_{i\\neq m}(y_m-y_i)}.\\tag{2}\n\\end{align} For our particular $x$'s and $y$'s, the formula (2) reduces to \n\\begin{align}\nA_{mn}^{-1}&=\\frac{(-1)^{m+n}}{m+n-1}\\frac{\\frac{(n+N-1)!}{(n-1)!}\\cdot\n\\frac{(m+N-1)!}{(m-1)!}}{(n-1)!(N-n)!\\cdot(m-1)!(N-m)!}=\\\\\n&=(-1)^{m+n}(m+n-1){n+N-1 \\choose N-m}{m+N-1 \\choose N-n}{m+n-2\\choose m-1}^2.\n\\end{align}\nThe last expression is clearly integer. $\\blacksquare$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original question is about showing that the inverse of the Hilbert matrix has integer entries. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The Hilbert matrix is defined as an n×n matrix where each entry A_ij is 1/(i + j - 1). The problem states that we need to show two things: that A is invertible and that its inverse has integer entries. The user mentioned they already showed A is invertible, so the main task here is the second part.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. In the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the matrix A is n×n, and each entry is defined by that fraction. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- A is an n×n matrix.\n- For each entry A_{ij}, it equals 1/(i + j - 1).\n\nWait, but do we have any other conditions? The problem doesn't specify any restrictions on n, like it being a positive integer or something. But since it's a matrix dimension, n should be a positive integer. However, the original problem might not explicitly state that, so maybe it's an implicit assumption. The example included assumptions that were explicit in the problem statement. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe question says \"Let A be the n×n matrix...\" So n is just given as the size, which is a positive integer. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe we don't need to list it unless it's part of the problem's explicit conditions. The example included \"n is an integer\" because the original problem stated \"for every integer n\". Here, the problem doesn't specify constraints on n, but since it's a matrix dimension, n is a positive integer. However, the user's example might include even implicit assumptions. Hmm.\n\nBut looking at the example provided by the user, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", so the assumption included \"n is an integer\". In the current problem, the Hilbert matrix is defined for an n×n matrix, so n is a positive integer. But the problem statement doesn't specify, so maybe we shouldn't list it unless it's given. Wait, the problem statement says \"Let A be the n×n matrix...\", so n is just a variable here. But to form the assumptions, we need to list all given conditions. The key here is that each entry is 1/(i + j - 1). So the assumptions are:\n\n1. A is an n×n matrix.\n2. For each element A_{ij}, A_{ij} = 1/(i + j - 1).\n\nBut maybe the problem assumes that n is a positive integer, but since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps we don't need to list that. However, in the example, the assumption included \"n is an integer\" because the original problem said \"for every integer n\". Here, the problem just says \"the n×n matrix\", so n is a positive integer implicitly. But since the problem didn't state it explicitly, should we include it? The user's example included \"n is an integer\" even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which was part of the problem statement. So perhaps in this case, since the problem mentions \"n×n matrix\", the assumption is that n is a positive integer, but maybe it's not necessary unless the problem states it. Hmm.\n\nWait, the problem statement in the example was about \"for every integer n\", so the assumption included \"n is an integer\". Here, the problem says \"the n×n matrix\", which implies that n is a positive integer. But the problem doesn't explicitly say \"n is a positive integer\", so perhaps the user's format expects only explicit assumptions. Since the problem says \"Let A be the n×n matrix\", then \"A is an n×n matrix\" is an explicit assumption. The entries are defined as 1/(i + j -1), so that's another assumption. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- A is an n×n matrix.\n- Each entry A_{ij} is equal to 1/(i + j - 1).\n\nBut the problem also says to show that A is invertible, which the user already did, so the main problem is showing the inverse has integer entries. But in the formatted problem, the problem part should be as stated. So the problem is to show that A^{-1} has integer entries.\n\nPutting it all together, the assumptions would be the two points above. The problem is to show that the inverse has integer entries. Let me check if there are any other assumptions. For example, maybe the indices i and j run from 1 to n, which is standard for matrices, but the problem statement doesn't specify. However, in the definition of the Hilbert matrix, the indices typically start at 1, so A_{11} = 1/(1+1-1) = 1/1. But the problem statement doesn't mention that, so maybe it's an implicit assumption. However, since the user's example didn't include such details unless explicitly stated, perhaps we don't need to include the index range here.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n- A is an n×n matrix.\n- Each entry A_{ij} is 1/(i + j - 1).\n\nProblem:\nShow that A^{-1} has integer entries.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user included the invertibility as part of what needs to be shown, but the question mentions they already showed invertibility and need to show the inverse has integer entries. So in the formatted problem, the problem part should be \"Show that A^{-1} has integer entries.\"\n\nBut the original problem's title is \"Why does the inverse of the Hilbert matrix have integer entries?\" and the question is asking how to show that. So the problem part should be as stated. The example given by the user had the problem part as \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91.\" So here, the problem is \"Show that A^{-1} has integer entries.\"\n\nSo yes, that should be correct. The assumptions are about A being n×n and entries defined as 1/(i+j-1). No other explicit assumptions given. The problem is to show the inverse has integer entries.",
