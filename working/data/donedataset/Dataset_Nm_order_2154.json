    "Content": "This is exercise number $59$ from Chapter $2$ of Hugh Gordon's Discrete Probability . Show that there are infinitely many rows of Pascal's Triangle that consist entirely of odd numbers. Intuitively, if you draw boxes around the numbers in Pascal's triangle and color the boxes black if the number is odd and white if the number is even, then the triangle will look like the Sierpinsky triangle as you zoom out. In particular, if we number the rows starting with the top as $1$, the rows will all odd numbers will be exactly the rows with number $2^n$ for some $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ (or $n=0$ for the first). You can see this if you think about the Sierpinsky triangle coloring. Anyway, is there any direct way to show the following for all $k$ with $0 \\leq k \\leq 2^n-1$? $$\\binom{2^n-1}{k} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$ This can probably be done by induction but a direct proof would be preferable.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Modulo $2$, $$(1+x)^{2^n-1} = \\frac{(1+x)^{2^n}}{1+x} = \\frac{1+x^{2^n}}{1+x}=1+x+x^2+ \\dots + x^{2^n-1}. \\qquad\\blacksquare$$ Also, modulo an odd prime $p$, $$(1+x)^{p^n-1} = \\frac{(1+x)^{p^n}}{1+x} = \\frac{1+x^{p^n}}{1+x}= \\frac{1-(-x)^{p^n}}{1-(-x)} = 1 - x+x^2- \\dots + x^{p^n-1},$$ which shows that $${p^n-1 \\choose k} \\equiv (-1)^k \\pmod p.$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to show there are infinitely many rows in Pascal's triangle with all odd numbers. The example given mentions rows numbered 2^n - 1, like row 1 (2^1 -1), row 3 (2^2 -1), row 7 (2^3 -1), etc. The key here is to prove that for such rows, all binomial coefficients are odd.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Lucas' Theorem, which deals with binomial coefficients modulo primes. Since we're working mod 2, Lucas' Theorem states that a binomial coefficient C(m, n) is odd (i.e., ≡1 mod 2) if and only if in the binary representation of n, every bit is less than or equal to the corresponding bit in m. \n\nIf the row number is 2^n - 1, its binary representation is all 1s. For example, 2^3 -1 =7 is 111 in binary. Then, any k between 0 and 2^n -1 will have a binary representation with up to n bits. Since the row number is all 1s, each bit in k's binary representation is ≤ the corresponding bit in 2^n -1 (which is 1). Therefore, by Lucas' Theorem, every C(2^n -1, k) is ≡1 mod 2. \n\nSo the problem reduces to showing this using Lucas' Theorem or induction. But the user prefers a direct proof. Lucas' Theorem gives a direct way, but maybe they need an explanation of why Lucas applies here. Alternatively, using generating functions or properties of binary expansions. \n\nAnother approach is induction. For n=1, row 1 (2^1 -1=1): C(1,0)=1, C(1,1)=1, both odd. Assume it's true for n, so row 2^n -1 has all odds. Then consider row 2^(n+1) -1. But how does that relate? Maybe using the property that C(2^(n+1)-1, k) can be expressed in terms of previous rows? Alternatively, using the fact that doubling the row and adding 1 relates to the binary structure. \n\nWait, maybe using the fact that in binary, 2^n -1 is a string of n ones. When you choose k, which in binary has up to n bits, there's no carryover when subtracting, so each bit in k is 0 or 1, which matches the all-1s of the row number. Thus, by Lucas, each combination is 1 mod 2. \n\nSo the assumptions here would be that the row number is of the form 2^n -1, and k ranges from 0 to 2^n -1. The problem is to show that all such binomial coefficients are odd, which implies infinitely many such rows exist (since there are infinitely many n).",
