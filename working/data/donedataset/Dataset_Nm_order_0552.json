    "AcceptedAnswer": "I will give two proofs of the result, one using minimal polynomials and one without. Proof 1: Let $A:V\\rightarrow V$ be an idempotent operator on the $n$ dimensional space $V$. Suppose that the rank of the operator is $r$. Then there exists $r$ linearly independent vectors $\\{\\mathbf{u}_1,\\ \\cdots,\\ \\mathbf{u}_r\\}$ in the image of $A$. Suppose that each $\\mathbf{u}_i$ is in the image under $\\mathbf{v}_i$:\n$$\\mathbf{u}_i = A\\mathbf{v}_i$$\nApplying $A$ to the above gives\n$$A\\mathbf{u}_i = \\underbrace{A^2\\mathbf{v}_i = A\\mathbf{v}_i}_\\text{idempotent} = \\mathbf{u}_i$$\nIt follows that each $\\mathbf{u}_i$ is an eigenvector under the eigenvalue $1$. On the other hand, we also have $n-r$ vectors forming a basis for the kernel. Together, the basis for the image and the kernel forms a basis of eigenvectors for $V$, that is:\n$$V = \\mathrm{im}(A) \\oplus \\ker(A)$$\nTherefore $A$ is diagonalizable. $\\square$ Using minimal polynomials, we can prove the result much quicker. Proof 2: A linear operator is diagonalizable if and only if its minimal polynomial splits into distinct linear factors. If $A$ is idempotent then\n$$A^2 = A \\implies A(A-I) =0$$\nThis means that $p(x) = x(x-1)$ is an annihilating polynomial for $A$. It follows that the minimal polynomial must divide $p$ and hence must split. Therefore $A$ must be diagonalizable. $\\square$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should list each condition line by line, addressing only one property per line for one object. The problem statement then follows.\n\nLooking at the original question: \"Are idempotent matrices always diagonalizable? How to prove that any idempotent matrix is diagonalizable?\" \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The key term here is \"idempotent matrix.\" The definition of an idempotent matrix is a matrix that satisfies A² = A. So the main assumption is that the matrix is idempotent. Are there any other implicit assumptions? The question is general, so unless specified, we don't restrict to real or complex matrices, but typically in such proofs, we might assume the field is algebraically closed, but the question doesn't specify. However, since the user example didn't add extra assumptions unless given, I should only list the idempotent property here.\n\nSo the assumption is simply that the matrix is idempotent. The problem is to prove it's diagonalizable. Therefore, the formatted problem should list the assumption as \"A is an idempotent matrix,\" and the problem is to prove that A is diagonalizable.\n\nWait, the example had two assumptions: one about n being an integer and another about divisibility by 7. But in this case, the original problem doesn't mention any additional conditions. The question is about any idempotent matrix. So there's only one assumption here: the matrix is idempotent.\n\nI should check if there's any missing assumption. For instance, is the matrix square? Well, idempotent matrices are square by definition because you can only multiply a matrix by itself if it's square. So maybe that's another assumption. But do I need to list that? The user's example didn't list \"n is an integer\" as two separate assumptions unless it's given in the problem. Wait, in the example, the original problem stated \"for every integer n\", so the assumption was that n is an integer. Then the user added \"n is divisible by 7\" as another assumption. Wait, no, in the original problem, the user's formatted problem example had:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem assumptions:\n- n is an integer,\n- n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that's conflicting. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the example? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which means the only assumption is that n is an integer. The conclusion is that A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\", which changes the problem. That seems like an error. So maybe the example provided by the user is incorrect. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instruction to structure the given problem according to the example.\n\nBut perhaps the user's example was a mistake, but I have to follow their format. However, in the current problem about idempotent matrices, the original question is \"How to prove that any idempotent matrix is diagonalizable?\" So the only assumption is that the matrix is idempotent. The problem is to prove it's diagonalizable. Therefore, the assumption line should be \"A is an idempotent matrix,\" and the problem is to prove A is diagonalizable.\n\nI think that's sufficient. The user's example might have included an extra assumption that wasn't in the original problem, possibly due to a misunderstanding, but I should adhere to the current problem's content. So in this case, the assumptions are just that A is idempotent. No need to mention it's a square matrix because that's part of the definition of idempotent. Similarly, the field isn't specified, but unless the problem mentions it, we don't assume. However, diagonalizability can depend on the field. For instance, a matrix might be diagonalizable over an algebraically closed field but not over others. But since the question doesn't specify, it's safest to assume that the field is such that the minimal polynomial splits into linear factors, which is typically the case in such standard proofs. However, since the user's example didn't include such details, perhaps we should not include them here.\n\nSo final answer: the assumption is that A is an idempotent matrix, and the problem is to prove that A is diagonalizable.",
