    "Content": "I don't know how to work out the homework of Leib&Loss P121, Ex4(b), in which we need to compute the following $$\n\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n}\\exp(-x^tAx)dx=\\pi^{n/2}/\\sqrt{\\det A}\n$$ where $A=A^t$ is a symmetric (thank Paul, see the comments) complex matrix with positive definite real part. It hints to use something like continuous extension, but I don't know how to do this? UPDATE Since it is easy to show in case $A$ is real, I try to show that $$\nF(t)=\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n}\\exp(-x^t(A+tBi)x)dx-\\pi^{n/2}/\\sqrt{\\det (A+tBi)}\n,\n$$ is independent to $t$ , the DCT make us differentiate under the integral, but I can't show that $F'(t)=0$ .",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "A corrected form of the question asks to show that $\\int_{\\mathbb R^n} e^{-x^tAx}\\;dx\\;=\\; \\pi^{n/2}/\\sqrt{\\det A}$ for symmetric $n$-by-$n$ $A$ with positive-definite real part. First, for $A$ real (positive-definite), there is a (unique) positive-definite square root $S$ of $A$, and the change of variables $x=S^{-1}y$ gives the result, as the questioner had noted. The trick here, as in many similar situations asking for extension to complex parameters of a computation that succeeds simply by change of variables in the purely real case, is invocation of the Identity Principle from complex analysis. That is, if $f,g$ are holomorphic on a non-empty open $\\Omega$ and $f(z)=g(z)$ for $z$ in some subset with an accumulation point, then $f=g$ throughout $\\Omega$. This can be iterated to apply to several complex variables, in various manners. In the case at hand, this gives an extension from symmetric real matrices to symmetric complex matrices (with the constraint of positive-definiteness on the real part, for convergence of everything). To be sure, the complex span (in the space of $n$-by-$n$ matrices) of real symmetric matrices is complex symmetric matrices, not $n$-by-$n$ complex matrices with arbitrary imaginary part. EDIT: To discuss meromorphy in each of the entries, observe that if $A$ is symmetric with positive-definite real part, then so is $A+z\\cdot (e_{ij}+e_{ji})$ for sufficiently small complex $z$, where $e_{ij}$ is the matrix with $ij$-th entry $1$ and otherwise $0$. Without attempting to describe the precise domain, this allows various proofs of holomorphy of both sides of the asserted equality. To prove connectedness of whatever that domain (for fixed $i>j$) is, it suffices to observe that it is convex : if $A$ and $B$ are symmetric complex with positive-definite real part, then the same is true of $tA+(1-t)B$ for real $t$ in the range $0\\le t\\le 1$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should list each condition line by line, focusing on one property per line applied to a single object. The problem statement then follows.\n\nLooking at the original problem from the user's example, they had to adjust the assumptions. The original problem had \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted version, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, but in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Hmm, maybe that was a mistake? Or perhaps the example had an error? Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. Maybe the example is not correct, but I need to follow the user's instruction regardless.\n\nNow, moving to the current problem. The Math Stack Exchange question is about computing a multivariate complex Gaussian integral. The user provided the original question and wants it structured into the Assumption and Problem sections.\n\nFirst, I need to extract all the assumptions. The original problem states:\n\n- The integral is over ℝⁿ.\n- The integrand is exp(−xᵗ A x) dx.\n- A is a symmetric complex matrix (A = Aᵗ).\n- A has a positive definite real part.\n- The result should be π^(n/2) / sqrt(det A).\n- The hint mentions using continuous extension.\n- The update mentions trying to show F(t) is independent of t, using DCT (Dominated Convergence Theorem) to differentiate under the integral, but couldn't show F’(t)=0.\n\nWait, the problem asks to compute the integral given that A is a symmetric complex matrix with positive definite real part. The assumptions here would be:\n\n1. The integral is over ℝⁿ.\n2. A is a symmetric complex matrix (A = Aᵗ).\n3. The real part of A is positive definite.\n4. The determinant of A is considered in the result.\n5. The problem involves a continuous extension argument.\n\nBut according to the format, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So let's break down each assumption properly.\n\nFirst, the integral is over ℝⁿ. That's one assumption.\n\nSecond, the matrix A is symmetric (A = Aᵗ). However, the question mentions that A is a complex matrix. So maybe split into two: A is a complex matrix, and A is symmetric.\n\nThird, the real part of A is positive definite. So the real part of A (which is a matrix) is positive definite. That's another assumption.\n\nFourth, the problem involves using continuous extension, which might be a method to solve it, but perhaps that's part of the problem's hint, not an assumption. The user's example included assumptions like \"n is divisible by 7\" which was part of the problem's conditions. Here, the problem's conditions are that A is symmetric complex with positive definite real part. The continuous extension is part of the method the user tried, but maybe not an assumption. So probably, the assumptions are about the matrix A and the integral's domain.\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The integral is taken over ℝⁿ.\n- A is a complex matrix.\n- A is symmetric (A = Aᵗ).\n- The real part of matrix A is positive definite.\n\nProblem: Compute the integral ∫_{ℝⁿ} exp(−xᵗ A x) dx and show it equals π^(n/2)/√(det A).\n\nWait, the original problem states that they need to compute the integral and the result is given. So the problem is to prove that the integral equals π^(n/2)/√(det A) under the given assumptions.\n\nIn the example provided by the user, they included both the problem statement and the assumptions. So here, the problem is to compute the integral as given, under the assumptions listed.\n\nThe update part in the original question mentions trying to use F(t) and showing it's independent of t. But that's part of the user's attempt, not part of the original problem's assumptions. So we should filter that out. The original problem's assumptions are only those given in the problem statement: A is symmetric, complex, with positive definite real part.\n\nSo, the structured problem should list the assumptions as:\n\nAssumption:\n- The integral is over ℝⁿ.\n- A is a complex matrix.\n- A is symmetric (A = Aᵗ).\n- The real part of A is positive definite.\n\nProblem: Prove that ∫_{ℝ^n} exp(-x^T A x) dx = π^{n/2} / √(det A).\n\nI need to check if all the assumptions are covered. The original problem mentions \"symmetric (thank Paul, see the comments) complex matrix with positive definite real part\". So the real part being positive definite is crucial for convergence, as complex matrices with positive definite real part would ensure the integral converges. The symmetry is needed for the properties of quadratic forms. Also, being complex matrix but with real part positive definite. So each of these should be separate assumptions.\n\nYes, that seems correct.",
