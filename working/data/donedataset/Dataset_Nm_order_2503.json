    "Content": "Right, so this was something I stumbled upon whilst looking at forms of the golden ratio (if you replace x with one in the diagram above then you get phi) and then I wondered about what if you messed with the value of x, did a massive amount of trial and error (lost in a notebook somewhere) then came up with the equation in the right, which worked exactly for every value I tested (about up to 100) Now I have found stack exchange, in wondering if there is a way to prove this, I plugged in some values into wolfram alpha and geogebra, which seems to show it works, but I want a proof, not just trial and error answers.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This is what's called a continued fraction . Let's denote your continued fraction as $f(x)$. Notice that if we subtract $x$ from $f(x)$ and take its reciprocal, we get $f(x)$ back. Therefore, $$\\frac{1}{f(x)-x} = f(x)$$ or $$f(x)^2-xf(x)-1 = 0$$ Solving for $f(x)$ using the quadratic formula, we get $$f(x) = \\frac{x\\pm\\sqrt{x^2+4}}{2}$$ It's not hard to see that if $x$ is positive, then $f(x)$ must be positive (as the reciprocal of a positive number is always positive, as is the sum of two positive numbers). Therefore, for $x > 0$, we have $$f(x) = \\frac{x+\\sqrt{x^2+4}}{2}$$ This is the same as $\\frac{x}{2}+\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2+1}$ (where we have just distributed the $\\frac{1}{2}$). Notice that $f(1) = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2} = \\phi$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to structure this problem properly. The user mentioned a conjecture they came up with related to the golden ratio by replacing x with one in some diagram, which gives phi. Then they messed with the value of x and through trial and error up to 100, they found an equation that worked. They want to prove it.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the actual mathematical problem from the description. The original problem isn't explicitly stated, but there are clues. The mention of the golden ratio (phi ≈ 1.618) and replacing x with 1 in a diagram to get phi suggests that maybe the equation they're talking about involves x and phi in some way. However, the user hasn't provided the specific equation they're referring to. The example they gave in their question shows that they might have an equation similar to the one in the example, but adjusted for their conjecture.\n\nWait, the example they provided was about divisibility by 91, but their actual problem is different. The user's problem is about an equation that worked for values up to 100 when they tested it. Since they mentioned the golden ratio and replacing x with 1, perhaps the equation involves x and phi in some identity or functional equation. However, without the explicit equation, it's challenging to structure the assumptions and problem correctly.\n\nLooking at the user's example, they had an assumption about n being an integer and divisible by 7. But in the current problem, the user's conjecture might involve variables or conditions related to the golden ratio. However, since the equation isn't provided, I have to make educated guesses based on the context.\n\nWait, maybe the user forgot to include the actual equation in their question. The original problem mentions \"the equation in the right\" which might be an image or a formula that wasn't transcribed here. Since this is a filtered version, perhaps the image isn't included. Therefore, the key information is missing, making it difficult to structure the problem accurately.\n\nBut the task is to filter out unrelated information and structure the problem as per the format. The user's main points are:\n\n1. They found an equation related to the golden ratio when replacing x with 1.\n2. They tested this equation for x values up to 100 and it worked.\n3. They want a proof, not just numerical verification.\n\nAssumptions might include that x is a real number (since they tested up to 100), perhaps that x satisfies a certain condition related to the golden ratio equation. However, without the specific equation, it's challenging. But maybe the problem is to prove that a certain equation holds for all x (or integers x) based on their conjecture.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be about proving an identity involving the golden ratio that they discovered. For example, maybe they found that for any x, a certain expression involving x and phi equals another expression, and they want to prove it's always true.\n\nSince the example given by the user had assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7, perhaps in this case, the assumptions would be that x is a real number, or integer, and maybe some condition related to the golden ratio. But without the equation, I can't specify the exact assumptions.\n\nWait, but the user provided their own example of formatting, which involved an equation. So perhaps in their actual problem, the equation is present but got lost in formatting. Let me check again:\n\nOriginal problem as per user's question: \"Solving a high school conjecture. Question: Right, so this was something I stumbled upon whilst looking at forms of the golden ratio... then came up with the equation in the right, which worked exactly for every value I tested... Now I have found stack exchange, in wondering if there is a way to prove this...\"\n\nAh, the equation is \"in the right\" which might mean on the right side of a page or image. Since this is text-based, perhaps the equation wasn't included. Therefore, the problem is missing crucial information. But since the user wants the assistant to structure it, maybe the assistant is supposed to infer based on the golden ratio context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the equation is something standard related to the golden ratio. For instance, the golden ratio satisfies x^2 = x + 1. If the user replaced x with 1, maybe they considered an equation like 1^2 = 1 + 1, which is false, but perhaps they adjusted it. Alternatively, maybe the equation involves continued fractions or other properties.\n\nBut without the exact equation, it's impossible to list accurate assumptions and the problem. Therefore, the assistant might need to point out that the equation is missing, but since the user provided an example where they reformatted the problem, perhaps they expect the assistant to proceed despite the missing equation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the equation is implied. For example, if replacing x with 1 gives the golden ratio, maybe the equation is x = sqrt(1 + x), but when x=1, it gives sqrt(2), not phi. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the continued fraction representation: phi = 1 + 1/(1 + 1/(1 + ... )). If they changed x, maybe they have an equation like x = 1 + 1/x, which solves to phi. But modifying x elsewhere?\n\nAlternatively, the user might have an equation like (x + sqrt(x^2 + 4))/2, which is a form of the golden ratio when x=1. But again, without the exact equation, this is speculative.\n\nGiven the lack of specific information, perhaps the best approach is to structure the problem based on the available information, acknowledging that the equation is missing. But since the example provided by the user included the equation in the formatted problem, maybe the assistant is supposed to assume that the equation is given in the original question's image or right side, which isn't present here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's equation is similar to the example but adjusted. For instance, instead of the expression involving 5^n and 6^n, perhaps it's an expression involving x and the golden ratio. But without specifics, this is impossible.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct approach here is to note that the problem is under-specified due to the missing equation, but since the user provided an example where they extracted the problem and assumptions, perhaps the assistant should attempt to infer based on the context.\n\nAssuming that the equation in question is an identity involving x and the golden ratio phi, which holds for all tested x up to 100, the problem would be to prove that identity. The assumptions would be that x is a real number (or integer), and perhaps some relation to phi.\n\nBut since the problem isn't clear, the assistant might need to make a best-effort structure. For example:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number,\nphi is the golden ratio (phi = (1 + sqrt(5))/2).\n\nProblem:\nProve that [equation involving x and phi] holds for all real numbers x.\n\nBut without the actual equation, this is a placeholder. However, the user's example included specific mathematical expressions, so maybe in the original problem, the equation was present but got lost in translation. Given that, perhaps the assistant should proceed by structuring the problem with the available information, noting the missing equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in omitting the equation, and the assistant should highlight that. But since the task is to format according to the given example, perhaps the assistant should proceed with the available data, even if incomplete.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to prove that a certain expression equals the golden ratio for all x, but that seems unlikely since the golden ratio is a constant.\n\nWait, perhaps the user's conjecture is that a certain equation involving x has the golden ratio as a solution when x=1, and they want to prove that it's true for all x. But without the equation, it's hard to tell.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, but following the example structure, perhaps the formatted problem would list assumptions about x being a real number, and the problem being to prove the equation (unspecified) holds for all x. However, this is not ideal. But since the user's example included the equation in the problem statement, maybe in the actual case, the equation is present, and the assistant should extract it.\n\nBut in the user's presented problem here, the equation is missing. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is to note that the equation is missing, making it impossible to structure. However, since the user provided an example, maybe they expect the assistant to proceed with hypothetical assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to present a different problem but forgot to include it. Given that, perhaps the assistant should reply that the problem cannot be structured due to missing information. But the user is asking to act as a professor and structure the problem as per the example, so maybe proceed with hypothetical content.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is similar to the example but in the context of the golden ratio. For example, perhaps the user's equation is something like A(x) = phi^x (phi^x + 1) - 6^x (3^x + 2^x), and they want to prove it's divisible by 91 when x is an integer. But that's speculative.\n\nGiven the lack of specific information, I think the assistant should structure the problem based on the available data, noting the missing equation. However, following the user's example, perhaps the problem is to prove that a certain expression involving x is always equal to a multiple of 91, with assumptions on x. But again, without the equation, this is guesswork.\n\nIn conclusion, the most accurate approach is to state that the problem cannot be properly structured due to the missing equation. However, adhering to the user's instructions and example, perhaps the assistant should proceed with the given information, listing assumptions related to x being an integer or real number and the problem being to prove the conjectured equation holds for all x, despite the equation not being provided.",
