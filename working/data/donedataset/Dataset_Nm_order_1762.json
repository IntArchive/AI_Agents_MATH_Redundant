    "Content": "I am trying to prove the following: If $A\\subset\\mathbb R$ is bounded and $\\,f:A\\to \\mathbb R\\,$ is uniformly continuous, then $f[A]$ is bounded. Could you check my proof? Let $A \\subseteq [-K,K]\\subseteq \\mathbb R$ . Let $\\varepsilon = 1$ . If $f$ is uniformly continuous there is $\\delta$ wuth $|x-y| <\\delta$ imply that $|f(x)-f(y)|<1$ for all $x,y\\in A$ . Let $a \\in A$ . Then because $A$ is bounded there is a finite number of balls $B(a_n,\\delta)$ that cover $A$ . Let the number be $N$ . Then $f(a)-N \\le f(x) \\le f(a) + N$ for all $x\\in A$ .",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Assume that $f$ is unbounded, and $\\sup_{x\\in A} f(x)=\\infty$. (The case $\\inf_{x\\in A} f(x)=-\\infty$ can be treated in the same way.) Then, there is a sequence $\\{x_n\\}\\subset A$, such that $f(x_n)\\to\\infty$. We can pick a subsequence $\\{y_n\\}$ of $\\{x_n\\}$, such that $f(y_{n+1})-f(y_n)>1$, for all $n\\in\\mathbb N$.\nSince $f$ is uniformly continuous, there exists a $\\delta>0$, such that, for all $x,y\\in A$,\n$$\n|x-y|<\\delta\\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad |\\,f(x)-f(y)|<1.\\tag{1}\n$$\nBut as $A\\subset\\mathbb R$ is bounded, then $\\{y_n\\}$ has a convergent subsequence $z_n\\to z\\in \\overline{A}$. In fact, we may pick the subsequence $\\{z_n\\}$, so that $|z_m-z_n|<\\delta$, for all $m,n\\in\\mathbb N$, which implies that, for all $m,n\\in\\mathbb N$, with $m\\ne n$, we have\n$$\n|z_m-z_n|<\\delta, \\quad\\text{while}\\quad |f(z_m)-f(z_n)|>1,\n$$\nwhich contradicts $(1)$. Note. Since $f$ is uniformly continuous, then $f$ extends continuously to $\\overline{A}$. This is done in the following way. If $\\{x_n\\}\\subset A$ is Cauchy, then so is $\\{f(x_n)\\}$, due to the uniform continuity of $f$. Hence, $f(x)$ can be extended continuously (and uniquely) to $\\overline{A}$. But $\\overline{A}$ is compact, since $A$ is bounded. The extension of $f$ shall be bounded, as it is continuous on a compact set, and thus $f$ is bounded on $A$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me start by looking at the problem the user provided. They want me to structure the Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example given shows how assumptions are listed and the problem is stated clearly.\n\nFirst, the original problem is about proving that a uniformly continuous function maps a bounded set to a bounded set. The user's task is to extract assumptions and the problem statement. Let me parse through the question carefully.\n\nThe title is \"A uniformly continuous function maps bounded set to bounded sets.\" The question body starts with the user stating they want to prove that if A is a bounded subset of ℝ and f: A → ℝ is uniformly continuous, then f[A] is bounded. They also ask for feedback on their proof.\n\nNow, I need to list the assumptions. The key assumptions here are:\n\n1. A is a subset of ℝ (the real numbers).\n2. A is bounded.\n3. f: A → ℝ is a function.\n4. f is uniformly continuous on A.\n\nEach assumption should be a single line addressing one property or condition applied to one object. The problem statement is to prove that the image f[A] is bounded.\n\nWait, the original problem mentions \"A ⊂ ℝ is bounded\" and \"f: A → ℝ is uniformly continuous.\" There's also a mention in the user's proof attempt that A is contained within [-K, K], which is a specific form of boundedness. However, for the assumption, we should state the general conditions given in the problem, not the proof details. So the assumptions should be A is a subset of ℝ, A is bounded, f is a function from A to ℝ, and f is uniformly continuous.\n\nThe problem is to prove that f[A] is bounded. So putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n- A is a subset of ℝ,\n- A is bounded,\n- f: A → ℝ is a function,\n- f is uniformly continuous on A.\n\nProblem: Prove that f[A] is bounded.\n\nI should check if there are any other implicit assumptions. For example, does the problem require A to be a specific type of bounded set, like closed or open? The original problem just states \"bounded,\" so no. The function f is from A to ℝ, and uniform continuity is given. No other conditions are mentioned. So the four assumptions listed above are correct.\n\nThe example given in the user's instruction had assumptions like n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but in this problem, the assumptions are about the set A and the function f. There's no mention of specific numbers or divisibility here. So the structure should follow the same pattern but with the relevant conditions for this problem.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have the four assumptions listed as above, each on their own line, and the problem statement to prove the image is bounded.",
