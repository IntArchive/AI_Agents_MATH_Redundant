    "Content": "This has essentially been asked before here but I guess I need 50 reputation to comment. Also, here I have some questions of my own. My Proof outline: (forward direction/Necessary direction):\nCall the symmetric matrix $A$. Write the quadratic form for $A$ as $x^{t}Ax$, where superscript $t$ denotes transpose. $A$ p.d. (positive definite) implies $x^{t}Ax >0 \\ \\forall x\\neq 0$. if $v$ is an eigenvector of A, then $v^t Av \\ =v^t \\lambda v \\ =\\lambda \\ >0$ where $\\lambda$ is the eigenvalue associated with $v$. $\\therefore$ all eigenvalues are positive. Any hints for the reverse direction? Perhaps I need to write $A$ as $PDP^{-1} $ where D is a diagonal matrix of the eigenvalues of A and the columns of P are eigenvectors? Also, a more general question but one that is probably important, is that, since the statement does not assume that A is real (in addition to symmetric), does the possibility of complex entries introduce any complications? Do I need to show that the eigenvalues are real? Thanks.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This is a (sketch of a) proof when the symmetric matrix $A$ is real.\nLet $u_1, \\ldots, u_n$ be the linearly independent eigenvectors which correspond to the positive eigenvalues $\\lambda_1, \\ldots, \\lambda_n$ of the real symmetric matrix $A$. Also, let  $z = c_1 u_1 + \\cdots + c_nu_n$ be a random $n \\times  1 $ real vector with $z\\neq \\vec 0$. Thus, we have: $z^TAz \\begin{array}[t]{l}= (c_1 u_1^T + \\cdots +c_n u_n^T) P D P^{-1}(c_1 u_1 + \\cdots +c_n u_n)\\\\\\\\\n= \\begin{pmatrix} c_1 \\|u_1\\|^2_2 & c_2 \\|u_2\\|^2_2& \\cdots & c_n \\|u_n\\|^2_2 \\end{pmatrix}\\cdot\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda_1 & 0 & \\cdots & 0\\\\\n0 & \\lambda_2 & \\cdots & 0\\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots\\\\\n0 & 0 &\\cdots & \\lambda_n\n\\end{pmatrix}\\cdot\n\\begin{pmatrix} \nc_1\\|u_1\\|^2_2 \\\\  c_2\\|u_2\\|^2_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ c_n\\|u_n\\|^2_2\n\\end{pmatrix}\\\\\n=\\lambda_1 c_1^2 +\\cdots + \\lambda_n c_n^2,\n\\end{array}$ which is clearly positive due to the positive $\\lambda_i$'s and it also holds $\\|u_i\\|_2^2 =u_i^T\\cdot u_i= 1$. I think you can fill in the details. Just to clear things out.. Because matrix $A$ is a real symmetric one, it can be written in the form $$A = P \\cdot D \\cdot P^{-1} = P \\cdot D \\cdot P^T,$$ where the columns of $P$ contain the right hand eigenvectors of matrix $A$ and $P^{-1} (= P^T$) contain the left hand eigenvectors as its rows. Thus, if $u_i$ 's are the right hand eigenvectors, then $u_i^T $'s are the left hand eigenvectors of $A$. Then, it holds:   $$u_i^T \\cdot u_j = \\begin{cases}\n1, & i = j\\\\\n0,& i\\neq j\n\\end{cases}$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that a symmetric matrix is positive definite if and only if all its eigenvalues are positive. They've already outlined the forward direction and are asking for help with the reverse. Also, they have some questions about whether the matrix being real or complex affects the proof.\n\nFirst, I need to structure the problem according to the given format. Let's parse the original question.\n\nThe user mentions that the matrix is symmetric. The problem is about proving an equivalence: positive definite iff all eigenvalues are positive. In the assumptions, we need to list each condition applied to one object. The matrix is symmetric, which is a key point. Then, the problem statement is to prove the equivalence.\n\nBut wait, the user also brings up whether the matrix being real is important. The original problem statement in the title doesn't specify if the matrix is real. However, the user's proof outline uses real matrices since they mention transpose (which for complex matrices would be conjugate transpose). The user is confused if they need to handle complex entries and if eigenvalues being real is necessary.\n\nIn the example provided, the assumption included that n is divisible by 7. So, assumptions here should include that the matrix is symmetric. But wait, the problem is about symmetric matrices, so that's the main condition. But also, since the user is asking about whether the matrix being real or complex matters, perhaps the original problem's assumptions need to clarify if the matrix is real symmetric. Because in complex cases, a symmetric matrix isn't necessarily Hermitian, and eigenvalues might not be real. However, in the standard result, when we say a symmetric matrix is positive definite iff all eigenvalues are positive, we usually consider real symmetric matrices. Because for complex matrices, positive definite usually refers to Hermitian matrices.\n\nSo the user might have an error in their problem statement. The standard theorem is for real symmetric matrices, where eigenvalues are real, and the matrix being positive definite (in the real sense) requires all eigenvalues positive. If the matrix is complex and symmetric, but not Hermitian, the eigenvalues might not be real, so the statement might not hold. Hence, the assumption should be that the matrix is real and symmetric.\n\nBut the original title just says \"symmetric matrix\", and the user is questioning if the realness is assumed. So, to structure the problem correctly, the assumption should be that the matrix is real and symmetric. Because if it's complex symmetric, the eigenvalues might not be real, and the equivalence may not hold. Therefore, the key assumptions are:\n\n- The matrix is real.\n- The matrix is symmetric.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. Then, the problem is to prove that the matrix is positive definite if and only if all its eigenvalues are positive.\n\nAdditionally, the user is asking if they need to show that eigenvalues are real. In the real symmetric case, eigenvalues are real, so perhaps that's part of the theorem, but the problem statement might be assuming that. However, the problem as stated in the title doesn't specify real matrices, so the user is confused. Therefore, the structured problem should include the realness as an assumption.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nThe matrix is real,\nThe matrix is symmetric.\n\nProblem:\nProve that a symmetric matrix is positive definite if and only if all its eigenvalues are positive.\n\nWait, but the original problem's title is \"Proving that a symmetric matrix is positive definite iff all eigenvalues are positive\". But in reality, for complex matrices, symmetric doesn't imply Hermitian, so the standard theorem is for real symmetric matrices. Therefore, the assumptions should include that the matrix is real. The user's question is whether the problem assumes realness. Therefore, in structuring the problem, we need to make that explicit.\n\nHence, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The matrix is real.\n- The matrix is symmetric.\n\nProblem: Prove that the matrix is positive definite if and only if all its eigenvalues are positive.\n\nAdditionally, the user is asking if they need to show eigenvalues are real. In the real symmetric case, eigenvalues are indeed real, so maybe that's part of the proof. But the problem statement might be assuming that, but perhaps it's part of the problem to show eigenvalues are real when the matrix is real and symmetric. However, the problem as stated by the user is to prove the equivalence, so maybe the realness of eigenvalues is implicit. But the user's confusion is about whether complex entries complicate things. So in structuring the problem, to make it correct, we have to specify the matrix is real and symmetric. Therefore, the assumptions should include real and symmetric.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe matrix is real,\nThe matrix is symmetric.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the matrix is positive definite if and only if all its eigenvalues are positive.\n\nNow, checking the example given in the problem, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition. So \"real\" and \"symmetric\" are separate assumptions. The problem is the equivalence.\n\nBut wait, in the original title, it's just \"symmetric matrix\", but the user's question brings up the real vs complex aspect. So by structuring the problem with the real assumption, we are adding that condition because otherwise, for complex symmetric matrices, the statement isn't true. Hence, this is necessary for the problem to hold.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have those two assumptions.",
