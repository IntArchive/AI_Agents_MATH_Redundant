    "Content": "Given a sequence $(\\mu_n)_{n\\in \\mathbb N}$ of finite measures on the measurable space $(\\Omega, \\mathcal A)$ such that for every $A \\in \\mathcal A$ the limit\n  $$\\mu(A) = \\lim_{n\\to \\infty} \\mu_n(A)$$\n  exists. I want to show that $\\mu$ is a measure on $\\mathcal A$. What I managed to figure out: $\\mu$ is monotone, additive and - if $\\lim_n \\mu_n(\\Omega)$ is supposed to be taken in $\\mathbb R$ - then $\\mu$ is also finite (I'll assume this). Also $\\mu(\\varnothing) = 0$. So we can wlog assume that $\\mu(\\Omega) = 1$ and that $\\mu_n(\\Omega) \\le 2$ for all $n$. Now what remains to be shown is that $\\mu$ is $\\sigma$-additive, or equivalently that for $A_n\\downarrow \\varnothing$, we have $\\mu(A_n) \\to 0$ (since $\\mu$ is finite). All attempts at proving this have been futile so far. I don't seem to see the right approach. If possible, I would like to only receive a hint rather than a full answer. But of course, I'd be quite happy with a full answer, too; if a good hint is hard to find! Thanks a lot in advance for your help! =)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I think I have figured out a (completely elementary) proof for this now. I'll prove it by contradiction: Let $A_n$ be a sequence of pairwise disjoint sets in $\\mathcal A$. Note that $\\sum_{n=1}^m \\mu(A_n) = \\mu(\\bigcup_{n=1}^m A_n) \\le \\mu(\\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty A_n)$ for all $m\\in \\mathbb N$ implies\n$$\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\mu(A_n) \\le\\mu\\left(\\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty A_n\\right)$$ To reach a contradiction suppose that this inequality was strict. We will use these $A_n$ to construct a set $B$ for which $\\mu_n(B) \\not \\to \\mu(B)$. By our assumption on the inequality being strict, the following must hold There exists $\\epsilon_0>0$ such that for each $n_0\\in \\mathbb N$ there exist infinitely many $m\\in \\mathbb N$ with  $$\\sum_{n=n_0}^\\infty \\mu_m(A_n) \\ge 2\\epsilon_0 $$ (if this weren't true, then for every $\\epsilon > 0$ there would exist $n_0, m_0 \\in \\mathbb N$ such that $\\sum_{n = n_0}^\\infty \\mu_m(A_n) < \\epsilon$ for all $m>m_0$. But then, for $m>m_0$ sufficiently large, we would have\n\\begin{align}\n\\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty} \\mu(A_n) &\\ge \\sum_{n=1}^{n_0-1} \\mu(A_n)\n= \\lim_{m'\\to\\infty} \\sum_{n = 1}^{n_0-1} \\mu_{m'}(A_n) \\\\\n&\\ge \\sum_{n=1}^{n_0-1} \\mu_m(A_n) - \\epsilon \\ge \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\mu_m(A_n) - 2\\epsilon \\\\\n&= \\mu_m\\left(\\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty A_n\\right) - 2\\epsilon \\overset{m\\to \\infty}{\\longrightarrow} \\mu\\left(\\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty A_n\\right) - 2\\epsilon\n\\end{align}\ni.e. $\\sum_n \\mu(A_n) \\ge \\mu(\\bigcup_n A_n)$\nwhich we assumed was not the case.) Using the bulleted property above, construct two increasing sequences $m_k$, $N_k$ recursively as follows: Choose $m_1$ such that $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\mu_{m_1}(A_n) \\ge 2\\epsilon_0$ and then choose $N_1$ sufficiently big that $\\sum_{n=N_1}^\\infty \\mu_{m_1}(A_n) \\le \\epsilon_0/5$. Note that in particular: $\\sum_{n=1}^{N_1} \\mu_{m_1}(A_n)\\ge \\epsilon_0$. Having constructed $m_1 < m_2 <\\dots < m_k, \\, N_1 < N_2 < \\dots < N_k$, choose $m_{k+1}$ so that $$|\\mu_{m_{k+1}}(A_n) - \\mu(A_n)| \\le \\frac{2^{-(n+1)} \\epsilon_0}5 \\;\\text{for all $n \\le N_k$}, \\qquad \\sum_{n = N_k+1}^\\infty \\mu_{m_{k+1}}(A_n) \\ge 2\\epsilon_0$$ and then choose $N_{k+1}>N_k$ such that $$\\sum_{n=N_{k+1}}^\\infty \\mu_{m_{k+1}}(A_n) \\le \\frac{\\epsilon_0}{5}$$ Note again, that this implies $\\sum_{n = N_k+1}^{N_{k+1}} \\mu_{m_{k+1}}(A_n)\\ge \\epsilon_0$. Now we are ready to construct $B$. It is defined as $$B = \\bigcup_{k\\in 2\\mathbb Z_+} \\bigcup_{n = N_k+1}^{N_{k+1}} A_n$$ Given an odd number $k\\ge1$, we have \\begin{align}\n|\\mu_{m_{k+1}}(B) - \\mu_{m_k}(B)| &= \\left|\\sum_{l\\in 2\\mathbb Z_+} \\sum_{n=N_l+1}^{N_{l+1}} (\\mu_{m_{k+1}}(A_n) - \\mu_{m_k}(A_n))\\right| \\\\\n&\\ge \\left|\\sum_{n=N_k+1}^{N_{k+1}} \\mu_{m_k}(A_n)\\right| - \\left|\\sum_{n = N_k+1}^{N_{k+1}} \\mu_{m_k}(A_n)\\right|  \\\\\n& \\quad - \\left|\\sum_{n = N_{k+1}+1}^\\infty \\mu_{m_k}(A_n)\\right| -\\left|\\sum_{n = N_{k+1}+1}^\\infty \\mu_{m_k}(A_n)\\right| \\\\\n&\\quad - \\sum_{n=1}^{N_{k-1}} \\underbrace{\\left|\\mu_{m_{k+1}}(A_n) - \\mu_{m_k}(A_n)\\right|}_{\\le 2^{-n}\\epsilon_0/5} \\\\\n&\\ge \\epsilon_0 - \\frac{\\epsilon_0}5 - \\frac{\\epsilon_0}5- \\frac{\\epsilon_0}5 - \\frac{\\epsilon_0}5\\\\\n&= \\frac{\\epsilon_0}5\n\\end{align} Therefore $\\left(\\mu_{m_k}(B)\\right)_{k\\in \\mathbb N}$ is not a Cauchy sequence, contradicting the fact that $\\mu_n(B) \\to \\mu(B)$. This concludes the proof that $\\mu$ must be $\\sigma$-additive.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants to show that the limit of measures μ_n is again a measure. They mentioned that μ is additive, monotone, finite, and μ(∅)=0. The main issue is proving σ-additivity, which for finite measures can be equivalent to showing continuity from above at ∅. So, given A_n decreasing to ∅, we need μ(A_n) → 0.\n\nFirst, I recall that for a single measure, continuity from above follows from σ-additivity. But here we have a limit of measures. The user suggests that since each μ_n is a finite measure, and μ(A) = lim μ_n(A) exists for all A ∈ 𝒜, we need to show μ is σ-additive.\n\nLet me think about possible approaches. Since we need to show μ(A_k) → 0 when A_k ↓ ∅, maybe we can use the convergence of μ_n(A_k) for each k. For each fixed n, since μ_n is a measure, μ_n(A_k) → 0 as k → ∞ (by continuity from above for μ_n). But here, we have a double limit: first n→∞ then k→∞. However, the problem is that we need to interchange the limits or find some uniformity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the Vitali-Hahn-Saks theorem, which states that if a sequence of measures converges setwise, then the limit is a measure and the convergence is uniform on disjoint sets. But that might be more advanced than expected here. The user might be looking for a more elementary approach.\n\nWait, the user mentions they want a hint, so maybe there's a way to use finite additivity and the fact that μ is finite. Let's consider the measure μ(Ω) = lim μ_n(Ω), which is finite. Suppose A_k ↓ ∅. For each n, μ_n(A_k) → 0 as k→infty. But we need μ(A_k) = lim_{n→∞} μ_n(A_k) → 0 as k→infty.\n\nTo interchange the limits, maybe use some uniform convergence? If μ_n(A_k) → 0 uniformly in n as k→infty, then lim_{k} lim_{n} μ_n(A_k) = lim_{n} lim_{k} μ_n(A_k) = 0. But how to show uniform convergence here? Alternatively, perhaps use the fact that since μ_n are finite measures and the limit μ is also finite, we can apply the dominated convergence theorem for the counting measure? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider that for each A_k, since A_k ↓ ∅, for any ε > 0, there exists K such that for k ≥ K, μ(A_k) < ε. But how to connect this with the μ_n? Maybe use the convergence of μ_n(A_k) to μ(A_k) for each k and the fact that μ_n(A_k) → 0 as k→infty for each n. But the problem is the double limit.\n\nWait, here's an idea: Fix ε > 0. Since μ is finite, μ(Ω) = M < ∞. For each n, since μ_n is a finite measure, and A_k ↓ ∅, for each n, there exists k_n such that μ_n(A_{k_n}) < ε/2^n. But we need to relate this to the limit as n→infty. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that since μ is additive and finite, to show σ-additivity, it's enough to show that if B_m are disjoint, then μ(∪B_m) = Σμ(B_m). But maybe that's not easier.\n\nAnother approach: Let’s assume for contradiction that μ is not σ-additive, so there exists A_k ↓ ∅ with lim μ(A_k) = δ > 0. Then, for each k, μ(A_k) ≥ δ. Since μ(A_k) = lim_{n} μ_n(A_k), there exists N_k such that for n ≥ N_k, μ_n(A_k) ≥ δ/2. But the problem is that the N_k may depend on k. If we can choose a single N such that for all n ≥ N and all k, μ_n(A_k) ≥ δ/2, that would lead to a contradiction because for each n, μ_n(A_k) → 0 as k→infty. But without uniformity, this seems difficult.\n\nWait, maybe using the finite measure property: Since μ_n(Ω) is bounded (say ≤ 2 as the user suggested), then for the sequence A_k, since A_k ↓ ∅, for each n, μ_n(A_k) → 0. So for each n, pick k(n) such that μ_n(A_{k(n)}) < 1/n. Then, μ(A_{k(n)}) = lim_{m→∞} μ_m(A_{k(n)}) ≥ liminf_{m→∞} μ_m(A_{k(n)}). But when m ≥ n, maybe μ_m(A_{k(n)}) < 1/n? Not sure. This might not work because k(n) depends on n.\n\nAlternatively, using the diagonal argument. Suppose μ(A_k) does not go to zero. Then, there exists ε > 0 and a subsequence k_j such that μ(A_{k_j}) ≥ ε. Then, for each j, since μ(A_{k_j}) = lim_n μ_n(A_{k_j}) ≥ ε, there exists n_j such that μ_{n_j}(A_{k_j}) ≥ ε/2. But then we have a sequence of measures μ_{n_j} with μ_{n_j}(A_{k_j}) ≥ ε/2. However, since A_{k_j} is decreasing and approaching ∅, as j→infty, A_{k_j} is also approaching ∅. But since each μ_{n_j} is a measure, for fixed j, μ_{n_j}(A_{k_j}) ≥ ε/2. But if k_j is increasing, then for each μ_{n_j}, as k_j →infty, μ_{n_j}(A_{k_j}) → 0. So for large j, this would contradict μ_{n_j}(A_{k_j}) ≥ ε/2. Hence, such a subsequence cannot exist, implying μ(A_k) →0.\n\nWait, this might be the way to go. Assume that μ(A_k) does not approach zero, extract a subsequence where μ(A_{k_j}) ≥ ε, then pick n_j such that μ_{n_j}(A_{k_j}) ≥ ε/2. But since for each fixed n, μ_n(A_k) →0 as k→infty, we can't have n_j and k_j both going to infinity with μ_{n_j}(A_{k_j}) ≥ ε/2. Hence, contradiction. Therefore, μ(A_k) must go to zero.\n\nSo the key idea is that if the limit μ(A_k) doesn't go to zero, then we can find a subsequence of measures and sets where the measure doesn't go to zero, contradicting the fact that for each measure, the measure of the sets does go to zero. This seems like a diagonalization or contradiction approach.\n\nTherefore, the hint would be to assume, for contradiction, that μ(A_k) does not converge to zero and construct a subsequence where μ_{n_j}(A_{k_j}) is bounded below, leading to a contradiction with the fact that each μ_n is a measure.",
