    "Content": "As part of am exam question (Q21F here ), I'm trying to prove that if $X$ and $Y$ are path-connected, locally path-connected spaces with universal covers $\\widetilde{X}$ and $\\widetilde{Y}$ , respectively, then if $X \\simeq Y$ then $\\widetilde{X} \\simeq \\widetilde{Y}$ . My attempt might be correct, but it seems too complicated and amongst the jumble I may have made some incorrect assumptions. So what I'm looking for is (a) verification or correction; and (b) ideas as to how I could simplify my argument. My argument : Let $p:\\widetilde{X} \\to X$ and $q:\\widetilde{Y} \\to Y$ be the covering maps, and let $X \\overset{f}{\\underset{g}{\\leftrightarrows}} Y$ be a homotopy equivalence. Fix a point $\\widetilde{x} \\in \\widetilde{X}$ , let $x=p(\\widetilde{x}) \\in X$ and $y=f(x) \\in Y$ , and fix $\\widetilde{y} \\in q^{-1}(\\{y\\}) \\subseteq \\widetilde{Y}$ . Also let $x' = g(y) \\in X$ and fix $\\widetilde{x'} \\in p^{-1}(\\{x'\\}) \\subseteq \\widetilde{X}$ . Define a map $\\widetilde{f} : \\widetilde{X} \\to \\widetilde{Y}$ as follows. For $\\widetilde{z} \\in \\widetilde{X}$ let $\\widetilde{u}:[0,1] \\to \\widetilde{X}$ be a path from $\\widetilde{x}$ to $\\widetilde{z}$ . Let $z=p(\\tilde{z})$ so that $u=p\\widetilde{u}$ is a path in $X$ from $x$ to $z$ . Let $v=fu$ , so that $v$ is a path in $Y$ from $y$ to $f(z)$ . Lift $v$ to a path $\\widetilde{v}$ in $\\widetilde{Y}$ with $\\widetilde{v}(0) = \\widetilde{y}$ . Define $\\widetilde{f}(\\widetilde{z}) = \\widetilde{v}(1)$ . Notice that $q\\widetilde{v}=v$ so that $q\\widetilde{f} = fp$ . Define $\\widetilde{g}:Y \\to X$ analogously: For $\\widetilde{z} \\in \\widetilde{Y}$ let $\\widetilde{a}:[0,1] \\to \\widetilde{Y}$ be a path from $\\widetilde{y}$ to $\\widetilde{z}$ . Let $z=q(z)$ so that $a=q\\widetilde{a}$ is a path in $Y$ from $y$ to $z$ . Let $b=fa$ , so that $b$ is a path in $X$ from $x'$ to $g(z)$ . Lift $b$ to a path $\\widetilde{b}$ in $\\widetilde{X}$ with $\\widetilde{b}(0) = \\widetilde{x'}$ . Define $\\widetilde{g}(\\widetilde{z}) = \\widetilde{b}(1)$ . Likewise, notice that $p\\widetilde{g}=gq$ . Claim: $\\widetilde{X} \\overset{\\widetilde{f}}{\\underset{\\widetilde{g}}{\\leftrightarrows}} \\widetilde{Y}$ is a homotopy equivalence. We have $p\\widetilde{g}\\widetilde{f} = gq\\widetilde{f}=gfp \\simeq p$ and $q\\widetilde{f}\\widetilde{g} = fp\\widetilde{g} = fgq \\simeq q$ . This shows that $\\widetilde{g}\\widetilde{f}$ and $\\widetilde{f}\\widetilde{g}$ are covering translations (deck transformations) and are therefore homotopic to the respective identity maps. So we have a homotopy equivalence. Any comments would be appreciated.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This is more of a long comment than an answer. Your way to go is certainly correct but a little more needs to be justified. First, I should say that there is no need to redefine (IMO in an exam) your $\\tilde{f} : \\tilde{X} \\to \\tilde{Y}$ . This is already given by the lifting criterion (Hatcher Proposition 1.33): Given a covering space $p : (\\tilde{X},\\tilde{x_0}) \\to (X,x_0)$ and a map $f : (Y,y_0) \\to (X,x_0)$ with $Y$ path connected and locally path-connected. Then a lift $\\tilde{f} : (Y,y_0) \\to (\\tilde{X},\\tilde{x_0})$ of $f$ exists iff $f_\\ast(\\pi_1(Y,y_0)) \\subset p_\\ast (\\pi_1(\\tilde{X},\\tilde{x_0}))$ . Since $\\tilde{X}$ and $\\tilde{Y}$ are simply connected the lifts will always exist. Of course your definition of how the lift is defined is exactly that given in Hatcher. However you are not exactly done yet because you have only proven that $p\\tilde{g}\\tilde{f} \\simeq p$ and $q\\tilde{f}\\tilde{g} \\simeq q$ . To finish the problem I think you can use the homotopy lifting property to tell you the following. Suppose that the homotopy between $q \\tilde{f}\\tilde{g}$ and $q$ is given by some $F :\\tilde{Y} \\times I \\to Y$ . Now the restriction of $F$ to $\\tilde{Y} \\times \\{0\\}$ lifts to some map $\\tilde{Y} \\times \\{0\\} \\to \\tilde{Y}$ . By uniqueness of lifts, we deduce that this map must be $\\tilde{f}\\tilde{g}$ . Then we know that there exists a unique homotopy $\\tilde{F} : \\tilde{Y} \\times I \\to \\tilde{Y}$ such that $\\tilde F|_{\\tilde{Y} \\times \\{0\\}} = \\tilde{f}\\tilde{g}$ and $$q \\circ \\tilde{F} = F.$$ Now we have that $\\tilde{F}(y,0) = \\tilde{f}\\tilde{g}$ , $q \\tilde{F}(y,1) = F(y,1) = q$ . However we now have by uniqueness of lifts that $\\tilde{F}(y,1) = \\textrm{id}_\\tilde{Y}$ , and so $\\tilde{F}$ is a homotopy between $\\tilde{f}\\tilde{g}$ and $\\textrm{id}_{\\tilde{Y}}$ . The proof that $\\tilde{g}\\tilde{f}$ is homotopic to $\\textrm{id}_{\\tilde{X}}$ is similar and we are done.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question provided. Let me read through it carefully first.\n\nThe title is \"Homotopy equivalence of universal cover.\" The user is trying to prove that if two spaces X and Y are path-connected, locally path-connected, and have universal covers, then if X and Y are homotopy equivalent, their universal covers are also homotopy equivalent. They provided their attempt and are looking for verification or correction and simplification ideas.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The original problem states that X and Y are path-connected, locally path-connected, with universal covers tilde X and tilde Y. The homotopy equivalence between X and Y implies their universal covers are homotopy equivalent.\n\nSo, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. X and Y are path-connected spaces.\n2. X and Y are locally path-connected spaces.\n3. The universal covers of X and Y are tilde X and tilde Y, respectively.\n4. There exists a homotopy equivalence between X and Y.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to prove that tilde X and tilde Y are homotopy equivalent given that X and Y are. So the assumptions are the conditions on X and Y (path-connected, locally path-connected, existence of universal covers) and the homotopy equivalence between X and Y.\n\nThe problem statement is to show that their universal covers are homotopy equivalent. So, each assumption should be a single condition applied to one object. Let me list them:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- X is a path-connected space.\n- X is a locally path-connected space.\n- Y is a path-connected space.\n- Y is a locally path-connected space.\n- The universal cover of X is tilde X.\n- The universal cover of Y is tilde Y.\n- X and Y are homotopy equivalent (i.e., X ≃ Y).\n\nProblem: Prove that tilde X and tilde Y are homotopy equivalent (tilde X ≃ tilde Y).\n\nBut wait, the original problem didn't explicitly state that X and Y have universal covers. However, in the context, the existence of universal covers is given because they mention tilde X and tilde Y as their universal covers. So maybe that's an assumption. However, usually, the existence of a universal cover requires the space to be path-connected, locally path-connected, and semi-locally simply connected. But the problem here might be assuming the existence of the universal covers by stating that tilde X and tilde Y are the universal covers. So perhaps the user is taking for granted that the universal covers exist, hence maybe we don't need to list the semi-locally simply connected condition because it's part of the problem's given that the universal covers exist. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- X is path-connected.\n- X is locally path-connected.\n- Y is path-connected.\n- Y is locally path-connected.\n- tilde X is the universal cover of X.\n- tilde Y is the universal cover of Y.\n- X is homotopy equivalent to Y.\n\nProblem: Prove that tilde X is homotopy equivalent to tilde Y.\n\nBut in the example given by the user, they listed each assumption line by line. So for each object, list their properties. So X has two properties: path-connected and locally path-connected. Similarly for Y. Then the universal covers are given for each. Then the homotopy equivalence between X and Y.\n\nSo the assumptions section would be:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a path-connected space,\nX is a locally path-connected space,\nY is a path-connected space,\nY is a locally path-connected space,\nThe universal cover of X is tilde X,\nThe universal cover of Y is tilde Y,\nX and Y are homotopy equivalent.\n\nProblem: Prove that tilde X and tilde Y are homotopy equivalent.\n\nYes, that seems right. Each line is a single condition applied to one object. Then the problem is to prove the homotopy equivalence of the universal covers. The original problem statement was as part of an exam question (Q21F), but the user is presenting their attempt. However, we need to structure the problem as per the format, ignoring the user's attempt and just presenting the core problem with assumptions.\n\nI think that's all. Let me check the example again. The example's assumptions were the integer n and that it's divisible by 7. Each in separate lines. Here, for each space X and Y, their path-connectedness and locally path-connectedness are separate assumptions, each on a line. The universal covers are given for each, and the homotopy equivalence between X and Y. Then the problem is to prove tilde X ≃ tilde Y.",
