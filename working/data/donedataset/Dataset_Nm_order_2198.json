    "AcceptedAnswer": "It is the smallest prime factor that is less than or equal to $\\sqrt{n}$, unless $n$ is prime.  One proof is as follows: Suppose $n=ab$ and $a$ is the smallest prime factor of $n$, and $n$ is not prime.  Since $n$ is not prime, we have $b\\ne1$.  Since $a$ is the smallest prime factor of $n$, we have $a\\le b$.  If $a$ were bigger than $\\sqrt{n}$, then $b$ would also be bigger than $\\sqrt{n}$, so $ab$ would be bigger than $\\sqrt{n}\\cdot\\sqrt{n}$.  But $ab=n$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The original question is about proving that the least prime factor of a number n is less than the square root of n. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe title mentions the \"Least prime factor of n is less than square root of n, proof\". The user also mentions they remember reading it but can't find the proof. So, the main problem is to prove that the least prime factor of n is less than sqrt(n). \n\nNow, for assumptions. The problem is about any integer n, but maybe there are some conditions. Typically, when discussing prime factors, n should be a composite number greater than 1. Because if n is prime, its least prime factor is itself, which is equal to sqrt(n) only when n is a square of a prime, like 4, 9, etc. Wait, but for primes, the least prime factor is the number itself, which would be greater than sqrt(n) unless n is a square. So, the statement probably applies to composite numbers with more than one prime factor. Let me think.\n\nIf n is composite, it can be written as a product of two numbers, say a and b, both greater than 1. The least prime factor p of n must be ≤ both a and b. If p is the smallest prime factor, then a and b must be ≥ p. But since n = a*b, then p^2 ≤ n, so p ≤ sqrt(n). However, if n is a square of a prime, like p^2, then the least prime factor is p, which is equal to sqrt(n). So the statement should hold for composite numbers where n is not a square of a prime. Wait, but the original question might just state \"n has a least prime factor less than sqrt(n)\", which would require n to have at least two distinct prime factors. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's check the exact wording. The problem is \"Least prime factor of n is less than square root of n, proof\". So the user wants to prove that for numbers n where the least prime factor exists (i.e., composite numbers), that least prime factor is less than sqrt(n). But in the case of n being a square of a prime, the least prime factor is p, and sqrt(n) is p, so it's equal. So maybe the problem has an assumption that n is composite and not the square of a prime. Alternatively, the original statement might include equality, but the user might have a typo or misremembering.\n\nBut since the user's original title says \"Least prime factor of n is less than square root of n\", perhaps the actual problem is for composite n, the least prime factor is ≤ sqrt(n). But the user wrote \"less than\", so maybe there's a condition that n is composite and has at least two distinct prime factors, making the least prime factor strictly less than sqrt(n). Alternatively, maybe the problem includes n as composite, and if n is a square of a prime, the least prime factor is equal to sqrt(n), so the statement would be \"less than or equal\", but the user wrote \"less than\". Hmm. This needs clarification.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is stated as \"the least prime factor is less than sqrt(n)\", and the user is misremembering, but the correct statement includes \"less than or equal\". But I need to structure the problem as given. The original problem's title is: \"Least prime factor of n is less than square root of n, proof\". So the problem is to prove that for n (which n?), the least prime factor is less than sqrt(n). Assumptions would be that n is a composite number, possibly not a prime square. Let's check standard number theory.\n\nStandard result: If n is composite, then its smallest prime factor p satisfies p ≤ sqrt(n). Equality holds when n is a square of a prime. So, the correct statement is that the least prime factor is ≤ sqrt(n), with equality iff n is a prime square. Therefore, if the problem states \"less than\", it might be incorrect unless n is composite and not a prime square. But the user's problem is as stated. So perhaps the original problem had an assumption that n is composite and not a prime square. But the user didn't mention that. So in structuring the problem, the assumptions need to be extracted from the original question. However, the user's question on Math Stack Exchange might have been more precise, but here we only have the title and the question statement. The title says \"Least prime factor of n is less than square root of n, proof\". The question is \"I remember reading this somewhere but I cannot locate the proof.\"\n\nTherefore, to structure the problem correctly, the assumption is that n is a composite number (since primes have only themselves as prime factors, which would not be less than sqrt(n) unless n is 4, 9, etc.), so the problem is for composite n. So the assumptions would be: n is a composite integer, and perhaps n is not the square of a prime. But without more information, perhaps the problem is stated for composite n, so the least prime factor is less than sqrt(n). Wait, but if n is 4, which is 2 squared, the least prime factor is 2, which is equal to sqrt(4)=2. So in that case, it's not less than. So maybe the problem assumes n is composite and has at least two distinct prime factors, making the least prime factor strictly less than sqrt(n). Alternatively, the original problem might have a mistake, but we have to follow the user's wording.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a composite integer,\nn has more than one distinct prime factor.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the least prime factor of n is less than the square root of n.\n\nBut wait, if n is composite, it can be written as a product of two integers a and b, both ≥2. Let p be the smallest prime factor of n. Then p ≤ a and p ≤ b. Therefore, p^2 ≤ a*b = n, so p ≤ sqrt(n). So equality holds when a = b = p, i.e., n = p^2. Therefore, if n is a square of a prime, the least prime factor is equal to sqrt(n). So to have \"less than\", n must have at least two distinct prime factors. Therefore, the correct assumptions would be that n is composite and not a prime square. But the user's problem states \"less than\", so perhaps the problem is under the assumption that n is composite with at least two distinct prime factors. However, since the user's original problem title doesn't specify, but just says \"Least prime factor of n is less than square root of n\", maybe the actual problem includes that n is composite and not a prime square. But we can't know for sure. However, as a professor structuring the problem, we need to make sure the problem is correctly posed. Therefore, the assumptions should include that n is composite and not a square of a prime. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is stated for n being composite, and the conclusion is that the least prime factor is ≤ sqrt(n), but the user wrote \"less than\". So there might be a mistake in the user's memory. But since we need to structure the problem as given, perhaps the user intended the standard result where the least prime factor is ≤ sqrt(n). However, the user wrote \"less than\", so maybe there's an additional condition. Alternatively, maybe the user's original source had a different condition. Since the user's example had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, here perhaps the assumption is that n is composite. But to be precise, we need to list the assumptions. So, possible assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a composite integer,\nn is not the square of a prime number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the least prime factor of n is less than the square root of n.\n\nAlternatively, if we take the problem as stated without additional assumptions, the problem might be incorrect for n = p^2. Therefore, to make the problem correct, the assumptions must exclude such cases. Therefore, the formatted problem should include those assumptions. But since the user's original problem doesn't specify, we have to infer. Given that, the correct assumptions are that n is composite (not prime), and the problem is to prove the least prime factor is ≤ sqrt(n). But the user's problem states \"less than\", so maybe they intended to exclude squares of primes. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumptions would include n is composite and not a square of a prime. However, without explicit mention in the original problem, it's hard to say. But as a professor, I need to structure it correctly. Since the standard result is that the least prime factor is ≤ sqrt(n), and the user wrote \"less than\", perhaps there's a mistake. Alternatively, the original problem might have had additional conditions. Given the user's example, where they included an assumption that n is divisible by 7 even though the original problem didn't state it (wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7). Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91\". But in the formatted problem, the assumption is \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be a mistake. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal problem example:\nProve that for every integer n, the number  \nA(n) = 5^n (5^n +1 ) -6^n (3^n +2^n )  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: \nn is an integer,\nn is divisible by 7.\nProblem:\nProve that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems like the user made a mistake in the example. Because the original problem is for every integer n, but the formatted problem restricts n to be divisible by 7. That would be incorrect unless the original problem had a typo. But perhaps the example is wrong, but following the user's instruction to structure the problem by filtering unrelated info and listing assumptions. So perhaps in that example, the original problem had a hidden assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the user didn't mention. Alternatively, maybe the example is just illustrative. Anyway, following the user's instruction, the task is to structure the problem by listing assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nBack to the current problem. The original question is to prove that the least prime factor of n is less than sqrt(n). The standard result is that for composite n, the least prime factor is ≤ sqrt(n). So the problem as stated by the user might be slightly incorrect, but assuming that n is composite and not a square of a prime, then the least prime factor is indeed less than sqrt(n). Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a composite integer,\nn is not the square of a prime integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the least prime factor of n is less than the square root of n.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is intended for composite n, allowing squares of primes, then the conclusion should be \"less than or equal\". But since the user wrote \"less than\", we need to adjust the assumptions to exclude squares of primes. Therefore, the formatted problem should include those assumptions.",
