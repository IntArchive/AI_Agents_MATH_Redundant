    "Content": "I read a section of a book and it made mention of the set of rationals not being a $G_\\delta$. However, it gave no proof. I read on wikipedia about using contradiction, but it made use of the Baire category theorem, which is unfamiliar to me. I was wondering if anyone could offer me a different proof; perhaps using the fact that the complement of $G_\\delta$ is $F_\\sigma$. Thanks.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I suspect that just about any proof that doesn’t directly use the Baire category theorem either uses a consequence of it or proves a special case of it. I’ve chosen the second course. Suppose that $\\mathbb{Q} = \\bigcap\\limits_{k\\in\\omega}V_k$, where each $V_k$ is open in the usual topology on $\\mathbb{R}$. Clearly each $V_k$ is dense in $\\mathbb{R}$. Let $\\mathbb{Q}=\\{q_k:k\\in\\omega\\}$ be an enumeration of the rationals, and for each $k\\in\\omega$ let $W_k=V_k\\setminus \\{q_k\\}$; clearly each $W_k$ is dense and open in $\\mathbb{R}$, and $\\bigcap\\limits_{k\\in\\omega}W_k = \\varnothing$. Let $(a_0,b_0)$ be any non-empty open interval such that $[a_0,b_0]\\subseteq W_0$. Given a non-empty open interval $(a_k,b_k)$, let $r_k=\\frac14(b_k-a_k)$; clearly $a_k<a_k+r_k<b_k-r_k<b_k$. Since $W_{k+1}$ is dense and open, there is a non-empty open interval $(a_{k+1},b_{k+1})$ such that $$(a_{k+1},b_{k+1}) \\subseteq [a_{k+1},b_{k+1}] \\subseteq W_{k+1}\\cap (a_k+r_k,b_k-r_k),$$ and the construction can continue. For $k\\in\\omega$ let $J_k = [a_k,b_k] \\subseteq W_k$. For each $k \\in \\omega$ we have $J_k \\supseteq J_{k+1}$, so $\\{J_k:k\\in\\omega\\}$ is a decreasing nest of non-empty closed intervals. Let $J = \\bigcap\\limits_{k\\in\\omega}J_k$; $J\\subseteq J_k \\subseteq W_k$ for each $k\\in\\omega$, so $J \\subseteq \\bigcap\\limits_{k\\in\\omega}W_k = \\varnothing$. But the nested intervals theorem guarantees that $J \\ne \\varnothing$, so we have a contradiction. Thus, $\\mathbb{Q}$ cannot be a $G_\\delta$-set in $\\mathbb{R}$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example they provided involved listing assumptions line by line and then the problem. \n\nThe problem here is about showing that the rationals ℚ are not a Gδ set. The original question mentions that the user knows Wikipedia uses the Baire category theorem but wants a different approach, possibly using complements (Fσ). \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem is in the context of topology, specifically dealing with Gδ and Fσ sets. The key assumptions here would be related to the properties of ℚ, Gδ sets, and their complements. Let me break them down:\n\n1. The set of rational numbers ℚ is considered as a subset of the real numbers ℝ.\n2. A Gδ set is a countable intersection of open sets.\n3. The complement of a Gδ set in ℝ is an Fσ set, which is a countable union of closed sets.\n4. The Baire category theorem is not to be used in the proof.\n\nWait, the user mentions avoiding the Baire category theorem and perhaps using the complement being Fσ. So the assumptions should reflect the properties needed for that approach. Let me make sure each assumption is a single property applied to one object.\n\nAssumptions:\n- ℚ is a subset of ℝ.\n- A Gδ set is a countable intersection of open subsets of ℝ.\n- The complement of a Gδ set in ℝ is an Fσ set.\n- ℚ is countable and dense in ℝ.\n- Every Fσ subset of ℝ with dense complement has empty interior.\n\nHmm, maybe the last point is part of the reasoning, not an assumption. The problem statement itself is to show ℚ is not Gδ. The user's question mentions using the complement being Fσ instead of Baire. So possible assumptions are:\n\n- ℚ is a countable dense subset of ℝ.\n- A Gδ set is a countable intersection of open sets.\n- The complement of a Gδ set is an Fσ set (countable union of closed sets).\n- If ℚ were Gδ, its complement would be Fσ.\n- The complement of ℚ, which is the irrationals, is not Fσ (but how to show that without Baire? Maybe via properties of Fσ sets and density.)\n\nWait, perhaps the key assumptions are the definitions and properties of Gδ and Fσ sets, and ℚ's properties. Let me list each as a separate line:\n\nAssumption:\n- ℚ is a countable set.\n- ℚ is dense in ℝ.\n- A Gδ set in ℝ is a countable intersection of open sets.\n- An Fσ set in ℝ is a countable union of closed sets.\n- The complement of a Gδ set is an Fσ set.\n\nBut the problem is to show ℚ is not Gδ. The user wants to use the complement being Fσ. So perhaps the problem is structured with these assumptions. I need to make sure each assumption is one line, one property, one object.\n\nSo formatted:\n\nAssumption:\nℚ is a subset of ℝ,\nℚ is countable,\nℚ is dense in ℝ,\nA Gδ set is a countable intersection of open sets in ℝ,\nThe complement of a Gδ set in ℝ is an Fσ set,\nAn Fσ set is a countable union of closed sets in ℝ.\n\nProblem:\nShow that ℚ is not a Gδ set.\n\nWait, but the original problem doesn't state all these assumptions explicitly. However, the user's example included some assumptions that were perhaps inferred, like n being an integer and divisible by 7. But in the original example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91, but the assumption included that n is divisible by 7, which might not be part of the original problem. Wait, actually, in the example, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the example? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That would change the problem. So perhaps the example is not correct. But the user provided that as their example. So maybe they want to include implicit assumptions. \n\nBut in the current problem, the original question is asking how to show ℚ is not Gδ, using complement being Fσ instead of Baire. So the key assumptions are the definitions of Gδ and Fσ, the properties of ℚ (countable, dense), and the fact that if ℚ were Gδ, then its complement would be Fσ. But how to structure that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is as stated, and the assumptions are the basic properties needed. Since the problem is to prove ℚ is not Gδ, the assumptions would be the definitions and properties required, each in a separate line.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the formatted problem would list the assumptions about Gδ, Fσ, and ℚ's properties, then the problem statement.",
