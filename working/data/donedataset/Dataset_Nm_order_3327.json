    "AcceptedAnswer": "By Stokes $\\int_c\\eta = \\int_D d \\eta$ for any disc $D$ with $\\partial D = c$ (which exists because all curves are contractible in $\\mathbb{R}^{2n+1}$), and then also $\\int_{\\phi(s,c)} \\eta = \\int_{\\phi(s,D)} d \\eta$ Thus it suffices to show that Lie drivative of $d \\eta$ is $0$. By Cartan's magic formula $$L_X d \\eta = d (i_X (d\\eta)) = d (i_X \\omega -i_X (dH \\wedge dz))$$ We have $i_X dz =1$. We then compute $i_X \\omega = dH - \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial z} dz$ and thus $d H = i_X \\omega + \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial z} dz$ which contracted with $X$ again gives $i_X dH =  i_X (\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial z} dz)= \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial z}.$ Plugging this in we get $$L_X d \\eta=d (i_X \\omega -i_X (dH \\wedge dz)) = d( dH - \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial z} dz + (i_X dH) \\wedge dz -  d H \\wedge (i_X dz))= d (0)=0.$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem step by step. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions and then the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the original question:\n\nThey mention H is a function from ℝ^{2N+1} to ℝ, of class C². So that's an assumption about the smoothness of H. Then, H is a function of (x, y, z), where x and y are in ℝ^N and z is in ℝ. So H's domain is specified here.\n\nNext, φ is the flow associated with a Hamiltonian system with specific differential equations. The equations for the flow are given for x_i, y_i, and z. The 1-form η is defined as the sum of x_i dy_i minus H dz. Then, c is a closed curve in ℝ^{2N+1}, and they need to prove that the integral of η over φ(s, c) equals the integral over c for all s.\n\nSo assumptions would include:\n\n1. H: ℝ^{2N+1} → ℝ is of class C².\n2. H depends on variables x ∈ ℝ^N, y ∈ ℝ^N, z ∈ ℝ.\n3. φ is the flow associated with the given Hamiltonian system (the three differential equations).\n4. η is the 1-form defined as ∑_{i=1}^N x_i dy_i - H dz.\n5. c is a closed curve in ℝ^{2N+1}.\n6. The problem requires proving the equality of integrals for all s.\n\nWait, the problem statement says \"for all s we have the integral over φ(s,c) equals integral over c\". So the assumptions are the definitions and conditions given, and the problem is to show the integral equality.\n\nBut in the example, the assumption included specific conditions on the variables and the structure. Here, the key points are H is C², the flow is defined by those ODEs, η is defined as such, and c is a closed curve. Then the problem is to prove the integral equality for all s.\n\nI need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. Let's try:\n\nAssumption:\n- H: ℝ^{2N+1} → ℝ is a function of class C².\n- H is a function of variables x ∈ ℝ^N, y ∈ ℝ^N, and z ∈ ℝ.\n- φ is the flow associated with the Hamiltonian system defined by the differential equations: \n   - ẋ_i = -∂H/∂y_i,\n   - ẏ_i = ∂H/∂x_i,\n   - ż = 1.\n- η is the 1-form defined as η = ∑_{i=1}^N x_i dy_i - H dz.\n- c is a closed curve in ℝ^{2N+1}.\n- The integral is considered over the curve φ(s, c) for all s.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"for all s\", so maybe that's part of the problem statement rather than an assumption. The assumptions are the given conditions, and the problem is to prove the equality for all s.\n\nSo, adjusting:\n\nAssumptions:\n- H: ℝ^{2N+1} → ℝ is a C² function.\n- Variables x ∈ ℝ^N, y ∈ ℝ^N, z ∈ ℝ.\n- φ is the flow of the Hamiltonian system with equations ẋ_i = -∂H/∂y_i, ẏ_i = ∂H/∂x_i, ż = 1.\n- η is the 1-form ∑_{i=1}^N x_i dy_i - H dz.\n- c is a closed curve in ℝ^{2N+1}.\n\nProblem: Prove that for all s, ∫_{φ(s,c)} η = ∫_c η.\n\nBut the example structured the assumptions each as one line. Let me check the example again:\n\nIn the example, the assumptions were \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". Each is a separate line addressing one condition.\n\nIn the current problem, each assumption should be a separate line. So breaking down:\n\nAssumption:\n- H: ℝ^{2N+1} → ℝ is a function of class C².\n- x is an element of ℝ^N.\n- y is an element of ℝ^N.\n- z is an element of ℝ.\n- φ is the flow associated with the Hamiltonian system defined by ẋ_i = -∂H/∂y_i, ẏ_i = ∂H/∂x_i, ż = 1.\n- η is a 1-form defined as η = ∑_{i=1}^N x_i dy_i - H dz.\n- c is a closed curve in ℝ^{2N+1}.\n\nBut wait, x, y, z are variables in the domain of H, so maybe combining that into one line. The original problem states \"H(x,y,z)\" with x ∈ ℝ^N, y ∈ ℝ^N, z ∈ ℝ. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- H: ℝ^{2N+1} → ℝ is a C² function.\n- H takes arguments x ∈ ℝ^N, y ∈ ℝ^N, z ∈ ℝ.\n- φ is the flow of the Hamiltonian system with equations:\n   - ẋ_i = -∂H/∂y_i for each i,\n   - ẏ_i = ∂H/∂x_i for each i,\n   - ż = 1.\n- η is the 1-form given by η = ∑_{i=1}^N x_i dy_i - H dz.\n- c is a closed curve in ℝ^{2N+1}.\n\nBut the problem mentions that η is a 1-form given by that expression. So each of these is a separate assumption. The problem is to prove the integral equality for all s.\n\nYes, that seems right. Each bullet in the assumption is a separate condition. So the answer would structure it accordingly.",
