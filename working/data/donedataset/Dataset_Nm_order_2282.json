    "Content": "Show that if $f\\in \\mathcal{C}^3$ and $2\\cdot\\pi$ periodic then the function $f'+f'''$ has at least $3$ zeros on $[0,2\\pi]$. My attempt : f is $2\\pi$ periodic and $\\mathcal{C}^3$, we have :\n$$\\lim_{h\\rightarrow 0, h>0} \\frac{f(h)-f(0)}{h}=\\lim_{h\\rightarrow 0, h>0} \\frac{f(2\\pi+h)-f(2\\pi)}{h}\\Rightarrow f'(0)=f'(2\\pi)$$ After that I tried to compute differently the limit \n$$\n\\lim_{h\\rightarrow 0, h>0}\\frac{f(h)-f(0)}{h}=\\lim_{h\\rightarrow 0, h<0}\\frac{f(h)-f(0)}{|h|}=\\lim_{h\\rightarrow 0, h<0}-\\frac{f(2\\pi+h)-f(0)}{h}\\Rightarrow f'(0)=-f'(2\\pi) \n$$ wich is clearly false because I get $f'(0)=0$ ( $f(x)=\\sin(x)$ is a counterexample). For $2$ zeros is relatively easy but I am stuck for the additional zero. EDIT : I find this exercice (as usual) here : Revue de la filière Mathématique. This was asked during an oral examination of École normale supérieure rue d'Ulm.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Assume that $g := f' + f'''$\nhas only finitely many zeros in ${\\bf R} / 2\\pi{\\bf Z}$.\nThen it has an even number of sign changes.  We show that there must be\nmore than $2$, and thus that there are at least $4$ sign changes\nin each period interval, so a fortiori at least $4$ zeros. Vladimir already noted that $\\int_0^{2\\pi} g(x) \\, dx = 0$,\nwhich implies at least two sign changes, and also\n$$\n\\int_0^{2\\pi} g(x) \\sin x \\, dx = 0,\n\\quad\n\\int_0^{2\\pi} g(x) \\cos x \\, dx = 0.\n$$\n(This can be proved either by integration by parts,\nas Vladimir suggested, or by Fourier expansion\nas suggested by nbubis .)   Therefore\n$$\n\\int_0^{2\\pi} g(x) \\, (A + B \\sin x + C \\sin x) = 0\n$$\nfor all $A,B,C$.  But suppose that\n$g$ had only two sign changes in each period,\nsay at $x_1$ and $x_2$.  Then we could find reals $A,B,C$\nsuch that $t(x) = A + B \\sin x + C \\cos x$ has sign changes\nat the same $x_1$ and $x_2$ and nowhere else.  Then\n$g(x) t(x)$ is either everywhere $\\geq 0$ or everywhere $\\leq 0$,\nbut is not everywhere zero; this contradicts $\\int_0^{2\\pi} g(x) t(x) \\, dx = 0$,\nand we're done. This is a known technique, used for instance to prove that\nall the roots of an orthogonal polynomial are real.\nTo contruct $A,B,C$ we can consider the points\n$(\\sin x_1, \\cos x_1)$ and $(\\sin x_2, \\cos x_2)$\non the circle $s^2 + t^2 = 1$, and join them by a line\n$A+Bs+Ct = 0$, which meets the circle at those two points\nand thus nowhere else.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let me try to parse through this problem and structure it according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a math professor who can filter out the unnecessary information from the original Math Stack Exchange question and present it in a structured way with assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nFirst, let's look at the original problem. The title says: \"The function f' + f''' has at least 3 zeros on [0,2π].\" The question body then elaborates that we need to show if f is in C³ and 2π-periodic, then f' + f''' has at least three zeros. The user's attempt includes some limit calculations and mentions that for two zeros it's easy but they're stuck on the third. There's also an edit mentioning the source of the problem.\n\nNow, I need to extract the key assumptions and the problem statement. The user mentioned f is in C³, which means it's three times continuously differentiable. Also, f is 2π-periodic. These are the main assumptions. The problem is to show that the function f' + f''' has at least three zeros on the interval [0, 2π].\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. So here, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. f is a function of class C³ (three times continuously differentiable).\n2. f is 2π-periodic.\n\nThe problem statement is to prove that f' + f''' has at least three zeros on [0, 2π].\n\nThe user's attempt in the original question includes some incorrect reasoning leading to a contradiction, but that's part of their attempt and not part of the problem's assumptions. The mention of the source (Revue de la filière Mathématique, oral exam from ENS Ulm) is extra information and can be filtered out. Also, the user's discussion about two zeros versus three is part of their thought process but not the problem's formal statement.\n\nSo, the structured problem should list the two assumptions about f being C³ and 2π-periodic, then state the problem of proving the number of zeros. The mistake in the user's attempt and the counterexample with sin(x) are part of their solution attempt, not the problem's assumptions or statement, so they can be omitted.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is three times continuously differentiable,\nf is 2π-periodic.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the function f' + f''' has at least 3 zeros on the interval [0, 2π].",
