    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified Assumption and Problem sections.\n\nFirst, I need to read the original problem carefully. The question is about proving that the infinite series sum of sin(n)/n from n=1 to infinity equals (π - 1)/2. The user also mentions a hint involving Euler's formula, e^(iθ) = cosθ + i sinθ. \n\nNow, the task is to extract assumptions. The example provided shows that assumptions are specific conditions or properties applied to one object each. In the original example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. However, in the current problem, the question is about an infinite series. \n\nLooking at the problem, the series is sum_{n=1}^∞ sin(n)/n. To determine the assumptions, I need to consider any conditions required for the series to converge or for the proof method to work. \n\nThe series involves sin(n), and n is a positive integer. The convergence of such series is known, but perhaps an assumption here is that the series converges. Alternatively, since the problem is to find the sum, maybe there are no explicit assumptions given in the original problem beyond the series definition. However, the user's classmate provided a hint with Euler's formula, which suggests complex analysis or Fourier series methods. \n\nBut the problem statement as given doesn't list any explicit assumptions. The user's classmate just posed the problem and the hint. So maybe the assumptions are implicit. Let me check the original question again. The user mentions that their classmate told them they guessed right and asked for a proof with the hint. The problem is to prove the equality, so the assumptions would be the conditions under which the sum equals (π -1)/2. \n\nWait, maybe the key here is that the series starts from n=1, not n=0. Also, the variable n is an integer here. So perhaps the assumptions are that n is a positive integer, and the series converges. But the example given in the initial prompt had the assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So maybe in this case, the assumption is that n is a positive integer. But wait, in the problem statement, n is the summation index, so it's already an integer by definition. However, in the example, even though n was an integer, it was listed as an assumption. So perhaps here, we need to state that n is a positive integer. But in the problem, the sum is over n from 1 to infinity, so n is indeed a positive integer.\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption listed \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But in the problem here, the sum is over n starting at 1, so each term is sin(n)/n where n is a positive integer. So the assumption would be that n is a positive integer. However, since the problem is to sum over n from 1 to infinity, maybe the assumption is that the series converges. But the problem as posed is to prove that the sum equals (π -1)/2, so perhaps the convergence is part of what needs to be proven. Alternatively, maybe there are no explicit assumptions here beyond the series definition.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions listed in the formatted problem were taken from the original problem. In the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", and the formatted assumption listed \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems contradictory because the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption added \"n is divisible by 7\". But in the example given by the user, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem's assumption added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like an error. Wait, no, perhaps the example was modified. Let me check again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n)... is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem's assumption lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that would mean the formatted problem is incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. Maybe that's a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the example is illustrating filtering unrelated information. But that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the example was from a different problem where n needed to be divisible by 7, but the original problem here is different.\n\nBut regardless, the user wants me to follow the format where each assumption is a single condition applied to one object. In the current problem, the series sum_{n=1}^\\infty sin(n)/n. The problem is to prove that this sum equals (π -1)/2. The user's classmate provided a hint involving Euler's formula. \n\nSo, what are the assumptions here? The problem is to find the sum. The convergence of the series is a prerequisite. But the problem doesn't state any assumptions explicitly, so perhaps the only assumption is that the series converges. Alternatively, since the series is known to converge (by Dirichlet's test, for example), maybe that's not an assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the sum is evaluated in the standard real numbers. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond the definition of the series. However, in the example, even though the problem stated \"for every integer n\", the formatted assumption included \"n is an integer\". So following that, perhaps here, the assumption is that n is a positive integer (since the sum starts at n=1). But in the problem statement, n is the index of summation, so that's inherent. However, the example included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption even when it was part of the original problem's statement. Therefore, perhaps in this case, the assumption is that n is a positive integer. But since n is the summation index, that's already clear. Alternatively, maybe the problem has no explicit assumptions beyond the series definition. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes knowledge of Fourier series or complex analysis, but those are methods, not assumptions. The user's task is to list assumptions of the problem, not the methods needed to solve it. \n\nTherefore, given the original problem as stated, perhaps there are no explicit assumptions beyond the series definition. However, the example shows that even if the problem states \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\". So perhaps here, the assumption is that n is a positive integer. But since the series is from n=1 to infinity, n is necessarily a positive integer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has no assumptions, but according to the example, it's necessary to list any inherent conditions. In the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", so the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\". Therefore, in this problem, since the sum is over n starting at 1, the assumption would be \"n is a positive integer\". \n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, n is the summation index, so it's understood to be a positive integer. However, the example included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption even when it was part of the problem's original statement. Therefore, following the example, perhaps in this case, the assumption is \"n is a positive integer\". But the problem is to sum over n from 1 to infinity, so maybe the assumption is that the series converges. However, convergence might be part of what needs to be proven. \n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to prove the sum equals a particular value, perhaps the key assumptions are that the series converges and that certain mathematical tools (like complex analysis or Fourier series) are applicable. But the problem doesn't state those, so perhaps there are no explicit assumptions beyond the definition of the series. \n\nWait, the example from the user's original question had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the original problem said \"for every integer n\". That seems like the user made a mistake in the example. Wait, no, looking back: the original problem in the example was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Unless the example is incorrect. Wait, maybe the example is a different problem where the original problem had n being any integer, but the formatted problem was for when n is divisible by 7. That would be a mistake. Perhaps the example is not correctly formatted. \n\nBut regardless, the user wants me to follow the format, which for the example includes assumptions that may not be present in the original problem. Therefore, perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions are that n is a positive integer, and the series converges. But since the problem is to evaluate the sum, perhaps convergence is part of the proof. Therefore, maybe the only assumption is that n is a positive integer. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are no explicit assumptions, and the problem is simply as stated. But according to the example, even if the problem states \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\". Therefore, in this case, since the sum is over n starting at 1, the assumption would be \"n is a positive integer\". \n\nSo, putting this together:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\sin n}{n}=\\frac{\\pi-1}{2}$$.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was not in the original. That seems like a mistake. Therefore, maybe the example is not a good guide. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants to extract assumptions that are implicit. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has no explicit assumptions, so the assumption section is empty. But the example shows that assumptions are listed even if they are part of the problem's original statement. Therefore, in this case, since the problem is about summing over n from 1 to infinity, the only assumption is that n is a positive integer. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\sin n}{n}=\\frac{\\pi-1}{2}$$.\n\nBut wait, the example had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in the original problem, it was for every integer n. So maybe the example is incorrect. Therefore, perhaps in the current problem, since there are no additional constraints, the only assumption is that the series converges. But the problem statement doesn't mention that; it's part of what needs to be proven. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no assumptions to list here, so the assumption section is empty. But according to the user's instructions, we need to list assumptions. If there are none, perhaps leave it blank? But the example didn't leave it blank. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumption is that the series converges. But since the problem is to evaluate the sum, convergence is part of the proof. Therefore, maybe the assumption is that the series converges, but that's not stated in the problem. \n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to follow the example's structure. In the example, the original problem stated \"for every integer n\", and the formatted assumption included \"n is an integer\". Therefore, in this problem, since the sum is over positive integers, the assumption is \"n is a positive integer\". \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\sin n}{n}=\\frac{\\pi-1}{2}$$.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is about the sum from n=1 to infinity, perhaps the assumption is that the series is considered in the limit as the upper bound approaches infinity. But that's inherent in the notation. \n\nAnother angle: perhaps the problem involves the unit of measurement for the sine function. Since the argument of the sine function is n (an integer), but the sine function typically takes radians. So the assumption could be that the sine function is evaluated in radians. But that's a standard assumption in mathematics, so maybe it's not necessary unless specified. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might assume that the sum is over real numbers, but that's again standard. \n\nGiven the example, I think the safest assumption to list here is that n is a positive integer. Therefore, the formatted problem should have that assumption.",
