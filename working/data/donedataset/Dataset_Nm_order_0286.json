    "Content": "Inspired by this answer , I'm trying to show that $$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{n}{e^{2 \\pi n}-1} = \\frac{1}{24} - \\frac{1}{8 \\pi}$$ using the inverse Mellin transform. But the answer I get is twice as much as it should be, and I don't understand why. EDIT: With Marko Riedel's help, I corrected the error in my evaluation. Since \n$$ \\left\\{ \\mathcal{M} \\ \\frac{x}{e^{2\\pi x}-1} \\right\\}(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^{s}}{e^{2 \\pi x}-1} \\, dx = (2\\pi)^{-(s+1)}\\Gamma(s+1)\\zeta(s+1) $$ for $\\operatorname{Re}(s) >1$, we have\n$$  \\frac{x}{e^{2\\pi x}-1}=\\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\\int_{c-i\\infty}^{c+i\\infty}(2\\pi)^{-(s+1)}\\Gamma(s+1)\\zeta(s+1) x^{-s} \\, ds , $$ where $c >1$. Replacing $x$ with $n$ and summing both sides, we get $$ \\begin{align} \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{n}{e^{2\\pi n}-1} &= \\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\\int_{c-i\\infty}^{c+i\\infty}(2\\pi)^{-(s+1)}\\Gamma(s+1)\\zeta(s+1)\\zeta(s)\\, ds \\\\&= \\frac{1}{2 \\pi i} \\int_{c-i\\infty}^{c+i\\infty} f(s) \\, ds. \\end{align} $$ The integrand has simple poles at $s=-1, 0$, and $1$. The fact that $\\left|\\Gamma(s)\\right|$ decays exponentially fast to $0$ as $\\text{Im} (s) \\to \\pm \\infty$ allows us to shift the contour to the left. I originally shifted the contour all the way to negative infinity. But as Marko Riedel explains below , we want to shift the contour to the imaginary axis since the integrand is odd there. Indeed, using the functional equation of the Riemann zeta function, we get $$ f(it) = \\frac{it}{2 \\pi} \\sinh \\left(\\frac{\\pi t }{2} \\right) \\operatorname{csch}(\\pi t) \\left|\\zeta(1+it)\\right|^{2}, \\quad t \\in \\mathbb{R}.$$ Therefore, $$ \\int_{c-i \\infty}^{c+i \\infty} f(s) \\, ds = 2 \\pi i \\ \\text{Res}[f,1] + \\pi i \\ \\text{Res}[f,0] ,$$ where $$ \\begin{align} \\text{Res}[f,0] &= \\lim_{s \\to 0} s (2 \\pi)^{-(s+1)} \\Gamma(s+1) \\zeta(s+1) \\zeta(s) \\\\ &= \\lim_{s\\to 0} s\\zeta(s+1) (2\\pi)^{-(s+1)}\\Gamma(s+1)\\zeta(s) \\\\ &= 1\\left(\\frac{1}{2 \\pi} \\right)(1)\\left(- \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\\\ &=-\\frac{1}{4 \\pi} \\end{align} $$ and $$ \\begin{align} \\text{Res}[f,1] &= \\lim_{s \\to 1} (s-1) (2 \\pi)^{-(s+1)} \\Gamma(s+1) \\zeta(s+1) \\zeta(s) \\\\ &= \\lim_{s\\to 1}(s-1)\\zeta(s) (2\\pi)^{-(s+1)}\\Gamma(s+1)\\zeta(s+1) \\\\&= 1\\left(\\frac{1}{4 \\pi^{2}}\\right)(1)\\left(\\frac{\\pi^{2}}{6}\\right) \\\\ &=\\frac{1}{24} . \\end{align} $$ The result then follows.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "In response to your query on the other thread -- I don't have the time to typeset this properly, here are some comments. The effort looks good and you should keep working on it. Don't extract any terms out from the transform function in front of the integral. As you have noticed yourself these reappear later on in the computation, reducing readability. Now this is the important part -- when evaluating harmonic sums you get an asymptotic expansion about zero when shifting to the left and about infinity when shifting to the right. So it is no surprise that you do not get the right value -- the expansion does not converge there (at $x=1$). With $g(s)$ being the transform of your sum we have\n$$ g(s) =  \\left( 2\\,\\pi  \\right) ^{-s-1}\\Gamma  \\left( s+1 \\right) \\zeta\n \\left( s+1 \\right) \\zeta  \\left( s \\right).$$\nThe residues are\n$$\\operatorname{Res}(g(s)/x^s; s=1) = \\frac{1}{24x},$$\n$$\\operatorname{Res}(g(s)/x^s; s=0) = -\\frac{1}{4\\pi},$$\n$$\\operatorname{Res}(g(s)/x^s; s=-1) = \\frac{x}{24}.$$\nNow I suggest you shift from $\\Re(s)=3/2$ to $\\Re(s)=0$, indenting around the pole at zero by making a half-circle of radius $\\epsilon$ around said pole at $s=0.$ This only picks up half the residue, so that your result is\n$$\\frac{1}{24\\times 1} + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(-\\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\right) =\n\\frac{1}{24} - \\frac{1}{8\\pi}.$$\nYou still need to verify that $g(s)$ is odd on the imaginary axis when $x=1$ by simplifying with the functional equation of the Riemann Zeta function. That is all for now. I hope there are no mistakes.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this problem and structure it according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor, so I need to be precise and clear.\n\nFirst, looking at the original question on Math Stack Exchange. The user is trying to evaluate the series sum from n=1 to infinity of n/(e^{2πn} - 1) using the inverse Mellin transform. They mention getting a result twice as large as expected and later corrected it with help. The problem now is to show that the sum equals 1/24 - 1/(8π) using the Mellin transform approach.\n\nNow, following the example format, I need to list assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then state the problem.\n\nLooking at the problem setup:\n\n1. The series is ∑_{n=1}^∞ n/(e^{2πn} - 1).\n2. The method used is the inverse Mellin transform.\n3. The Mellin transform of x/(e^{2πx} - 1) is given as (2π)^{-(s+1)} Γ(s+1) ζ(s+1) for Re(s) > 1.\n4. The inverse Mellin transform is set up as an integral from c - i∞ to c + i∞ with c > 1.\n5. The integrand after summing over n becomes (2π)^{-(s+1)} Γ(s+1) ζ(s+1) ζ(s).\n6. The integrand has simple poles at s = -1, 0, 1. However, in the residues calculated, only s=0 and s=1 are considered. Wait, the original problem mentions poles at s=-1, 0, 1, but in the residue calculation, only 0 and 1 are addressed. Maybe s=-1 is not contributing? Or perhaps that's an assumption. Need to check.\n\nWait, the user later mentions shifting the contour to the left, considering residues at s=1 and s=0. The pole at s=-1 might be outside the shifted contour or not contributing. But in the problem explanation, they end up calculating residues at 0 and 1. The functional equation part leads to considering the integral on the imaginary axis, and the residues at 0 and 1 give the required terms.\n\nAssumptions to list:\n\n- The Mellin transform of x/(e^{2πx} - 1) is (2π)^{-(s+1)} Γ(s+1) ζ(s+1) for Re(s) > 1.\n- The inverse Mellin transform integral is valid for c > 1.\n- The integrand after summing becomes (2π)^{-(s+1)} Γ(s+1) ζ(s+1) ζ(s).\n- The integrand has simple poles at s = -1, 0, 1. (But in the solution, only 0 and 1 are used. However, the problem statement mentions all three, so need to include them as poles. The user might have considered that s=-1 is not within the contour after shifting. But according to the original problem, they shifted the contour to the left, so perhaps s=-1 is included. But in the actual residue computation, they only compute at 0 and 1. Maybe the residue at s=-1 is zero or cancels out? The problem mentions that the contour is shifted to the imaginary axis because the integrand is odd there. So perhaps the poles at s=-1 is handled via the functional equation. Hmm, but the user's final calculation only includes residues at 0 and 1. The problem statement says \"has simple poles at s=-1, 0, and 1\", so that's an assumption. Then the residues computed are at 0 and 1. So perhaps the residue at s=-1 is not contributing because of the way the contour is shifted. But in the problem explanation, they mention shifting to the imaginary axis and using the functional equation. Maybe the pole at s=-1 is canceled or gives no contribution due to the oddness? The exact reasoning is part of the solution, but as per the problem setup, the poles are at -1,0,1.\n\nSo, to list the assumptions:\n\nEach assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- The Mellin transform of \\( \\frac{x}{e^{2\\pi x} - 1} \\) is \\( (2\\pi)^{-(s+1)} \\Gamma(s+1) \\zeta(s+1) \\) for \\( \\text{Re}(s) > 1 \\).\n- The inverse Mellin transform integral is valid with \\( c > 1 \\).\n- The function \\( f(s) = (2\\pi)^{-(s+1)} \\Gamma(s+1) \\zeta(s+1) \\zeta(s) \\) has simple poles at \\( s = -1, 0, 1 \\).\n- The integrand \\( f(s) \\) decays exponentially as \\( \\text{Im}(s) \\to \\pm \\infty \\).\n- The contour can be shifted to the imaginary axis due to the integrand being odd there.\n- The residues at \\( s = 1 \\) and \\( s = 0 \\) contribute to the integral.\n\nWait, the problem statement mentions that shifting the contour to the left is possible because Γ(s) decays exponentially. Then shifting to the imaginary axis since the integrand is odd there. Then using the functional equation to rewrite f(it). The functional equation part is part of the solution, but perhaps not an assumption.\n\nThe problem is to show the sum equals 1/24 - 1/(8π) using the inverse Mellin transform. The key assumptions are the Mellin transform, the poles, the contour shifting, and the residues.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions should be listed as separate lines, each addressing only one property. Let me structure them:\n\nAssumption:\n- The Mellin transform of \\( \\frac{x}{e^{2\\pi x} - 1} \\) is \\( (2\\pi)^{-(s+1)} \\Gamma(s+1) \\zeta(s+1) \\) for \\( \\text{Re}(s) > 1 \\).\n- The inverse Mellin transform of the function is represented as \\( \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\int_{c - i\\infty}^{c + i\\infty} (2\\pi)^{-(s+1)} \\Gamma(s+1) \\zeta(s+1) x^{-s} \\, ds \\) with \\( c > 1 \\).\n- Summing both sides over \\( n \\geq 1 \\) leads to \\( \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{n}{e^{2\\pi n} -1} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\int_{c - i\\infty}^{c + i\\infty} (2\\pi)^{-(s+1)} \\Gamma(s+1) \\zeta(s+1) \\zeta(s) \\, ds \\).\n- The integrand \\( f(s) = (2\\pi)^{-(s+1)} \\Gamma(s+1) \\zeta(s+1) \\zeta(s) \\) has simple poles at \\( s = -1, 0, 1 \\).\n- The function \\( |\\Gamma(s)| \\) decays exponentially as \\( \\text{Im}(s) \\to \\pm \\infty \\).\n- The contour of integration can be shifted to the left to the imaginary axis.\n- The integrand is odd along the imaginary axis.\n- The functional equation of the Riemann zeta function relates \\( f(it) \\) to hyperbolic functions and \\( |\\zeta(1 + it)|^2 \\).\n- The residues at \\( s = 1 \\) and \\( s = 0 \\) contribute to the integral result.\n\nBut the example provided had only two assumptions. However, the original example may vary. Wait, in the example given by the user, the original problem had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in the problem presented here, there are multiple steps and conditions. However, according to the instructions, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nPerhaps the key assumptions are:\n\n- The Mellin transform of \\( \\frac{x}{e^{2\\pi x} -1} \\) is given by \\( (2\\pi)^{-(s+1)} \\Gamma(s+1) \\zeta(s+1) \\) for \\( \\text{Re}(s) > 1 \\).\n- The inverse Mellin transform allows representing the original function as a contour integral.\n- Summing over \\( n \\) transforms the equation into a contour integral involving \\( \\zeta(s) \\).\n- The integrand \\( f(s) \\) has poles at \\( s = -1, 0, 1 \\).\n- The contour can be shifted left due to exponential decay of \\( \\Gamma(s) \\).\n- The integrand is odd along the imaginary axis, simplifying the integral.\n- The residues at \\( s = 1 \\) and \\( s = 0 \\) are calculated as \\( \\frac{1}{24} \\) and \\( -\\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\), respectively.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about the variable's properties. Here, the assumptions are about the transforms, integrals, poles, etc. Maybe we need to list the mathematical conditions used in setting up the problem.\n\nAlternatively, focusing on the problem statement:\n\nThe user wants to show the series equals 1/24 - 1/(8π) using the inverse Mellin transform. The key steps are applying the Mellin transform, summing the series, evaluating the contour integral by residues. The assumptions would be the necessary conditions for each of these steps.\n\nTherefore, structuring the assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\n- For \\( \\text{Re}(s) > 1 \\), the Mellin transform \\( \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^{s}}{e^{2\\pi x} -1} \\, dx = (2\\pi)^{-(s+1)} \\Gamma(s+1) \\zeta(s+1) \\).\n- The inverse Mellin transform of \\( (2\\pi)^{-(s+1)} \\Gamma(s+1) \\zeta(s+1) \\) is \\( \\frac{x}{e^{2\\pi x} -1} \\).\n- Summing both sides over \\( n \\geq 1 \\) interchanges the sum and integral.\n- The function \\( f(s) = (2\\pi)^{-(s+1)} \\Gamma(s+1) \\zeta(s+1) \\zeta(s) \\) has poles at \\( s = -1, 0, 1 \\).\n- The Gamma function \\( \\Gamma(s) \\) decays exponentially as \\( \\text{Im}(s) \\to \\pm \\infty \\).\n- Shifting the contour to the imaginary axis is valid and the integrand is odd there.\n- The residues at \\( s = 1 \\) and \\( s = 0 \\) contribute to the integral's value.\n\nBut the problem mentions that the contour shift leads to considering residues at 0 and 1, and the residue at s=-1 is not computed. However, the problem statement does include s=-1 as a pole. Therefore, the assumption should list all poles mentioned, even if some don't contribute. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- The Mellin transform of \\( \\frac{x}{e^{2\\pi x} -1} \\) is \\( (2\\pi)^{-(s+1)} \\Gamma(s+1) \\zeta(s+1) \\) for \\( \\text{Re}(s) > 1 \\).\n- The inverse Mellin transform represents \\( \\frac{x}{e^{2\\pi x} -1} \\) as a contour integral.\n- Summing over \\( n \\) transforms the equation into an integral involving \\( \\zeta(s) \\).\n- The integrand \\( f(s) = (2\\pi)^{-(s+1)} \\Gamma(s+1) \\zeta(s+1) \\zeta(s) \\) has simple poles at \\( s = -1, 0, 1 \\).\n- The integrand decays exponentially as \\( \\text{Im}(s) \\to \\pm \\infty \\), allowing contour shifting.\n- The shifted contour along the imaginary axis results in the integrand being odd.\n- The residues at \\( s = 1 \\) and \\( s = 0 \\) are computed to evaluate the integral.\n\nBut each assumption should be a single line, one property. Let me list each as separate points.\n\nAssumption:\n- The function \\( \\frac{x}{e^{2\\pi x} -1} \\) has Mellin transform \\( (2\\pi)^{-(s+1)} \\Gamma(s+1) \\zeta(s+1) \\) for \\( \\text{Re}(s) > 1 \\).\n- The inverse Mellin transform is valid for \\( c > 1 \\).\n- The sum \\( \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{n}{e^{2\\pi n} -1} \\) can be expressed as a contour integral involving \\( \\zeta(s) \\).\n- The integrand \\( f(s) = (2\\pi)^{-(s+1)} \\Gamma(s+1) \\zeta(s+1) \\zeta(s) \\) has poles at \\( s = -1, 0, 1 \\).\n- \\( \\Gamma(s) \\) decays exponentially as \\( \\text{Im}(s) \\to \\pm \\infty \\).\n- The contour can be shifted to the imaginary axis due to the integrand's decay.\n- The integrand is odd along the imaginary axis.\n- The residues at \\( s = 1 \\) and \\( s = 0 \\) contribute to the integral's value.\n\nBut maybe some of these are part of the problem solution rather than assumptions. The key assumptions needed to set up the problem are:\n\n- The given Mellin transform.\n- The validity of the inverse transform.\n- The interchange of sum and integral.\n- The location of the poles.\n- The decay allowing contour shift.\n\nThe problem is to prove the sum equals the given value using the Mellin transform, so the assumptions are the conditions that allow using that method.\n\nIn the example, the assumptions were about the variable's properties. Here, the assumptions are about the functions and transforms used.\n\nSo, finalizing:\n\nAssumption:\n- The Mellin transform of \\( \\frac{x}{e^{2\\pi x} -1} \\) is \\( (2\\pi)^{-(s+1)} \\Gamma(s+1) \\zeta(s+1) \\) for \\( \\text{Re}(s) > 1 \\).\n- The inverse Mellin transform represents \\( \\frac{x}{e^{2\\pi x} -1} \\) as \\( \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\int_{c - i\\infty}^{c + i\\infty} (2\\pi)^{-(s+1)} \\Gamma(s+1) \\zeta(s+1) x^{-s} \\, ds \\) with \\( c > 1 \\).\n- Summing both sides over \\( n \\geq 1 \\) leads to an expression involving \\( \\zeta(s) \\).\n- The integrand \\( f(s) = (2\\pi)^{-(s+1)} \\Gamma(s+1) \\zeta(s+1) \\zeta(s) \\) has simple poles at \\( s = -1, 0, 1 \\).\n- The function \\( \\Gamma(s) \\) decays exponentially as \\( \\text{Im}(s) \\to \\pm \\infty \\).\n- The contour can be shifted to the left, passing through the imaginary axis.\n- The integrand is odd along the imaginary axis, simplifying the integral evaluation.\n\nEach of these is a single line, addressing one property or condition.\n\nProblem: Show that \\( \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{n}{e^{2 \\pi n}-1} = \\frac{1}{24} - \\frac{1}{8 \\pi} \\) using the inverse Mellin transform.",
