    "Content": "I found the following property of compact operators in a proof, and I can't prove it. Prove that if $T \\in \\mathcal{L}(E,F)$ is compact, and if $u_n \\rightharpoonup u$ (the sequence converges weakly to $u$ in $\\sigma(E,E^*)$) then $Tu_n \\to Tu$ strongly in $F$. I was able to prove that $Tu_n$ has a convergent subsequence ($u_n \\rightharpoonup u$ implies that $(u_n)$ is bounded in $E$. Then, because $T$ is compact it must follow that $(Tu_n)$ must contain some strong convergent subsequence), but didn't manage to finalize the proof. Any reference or hints are welcome.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. So, the user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The original question is about compact operators mapping weakly convergent sequences to strongly convergent ones. Let me read through the problem again carefully.\n\nThe user on Math Stack Exchange is asking to prove that if T is a compact operator between Banach spaces E and F, and if u_n converges weakly to u in the weak topology σ(E, E*), then T u_n converges strongly to T u in F. They mention they've managed to show that T u_n has a convergent subsequence but can't finalize the proof. \n\nFirst, I need to filter out any unrelated information. The original problem states that T is compact, u_n converges weakly to u, and we need to show T u_n converges strongly. The user also mentions they showed T u_n has a convergent subsequence because u_n is bounded and T is compact. But they can't finish the proof. The key here is that the user's attempt is part of the original problem, but when structuring, we need to present only the problem and assumptions, not the attempt. So the user's own progress is part of the original question but should be excluded from the formatted problem.\n\nNow, to structure it into the required format. The assumptions should list each condition applied to each object. Let's break it down:\n\n1. T is an element of L(E, F), the space of bounded linear operators between E and F.\n2. T is a compact operator.\n3. u_n converges weakly to u in the weak topology σ(E, E*), meaning u_n ⇀ u.\n4. The problem is to prove that T u_n converges strongly to T u in F.\n\nWait, but in the example given, assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So here:\n\n- The first assumption is about T: it's a compact operator in L(E,F). So \"T ∈ L(E,F) is compact\" can be split into two assumptions if needed. But maybe \"T is a compact operator\" suffices. Wait, the example had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Each is a separate line.\n\nBut here, the original problem states T is compact, and u_n converges weakly. So the assumptions are:\n\n- T is a compact operator (since compactness is a property of T).\n- u_n converges weakly to u (this is a condition on the sequence u_n).\n\nWait, but the problem is in the context of Banach spaces E and F, so maybe we need to note that E and F are Banach spaces? The original question doesn't explicitly state that, but since they're talking about weak convergence and compact operators, it's standard that E and F are Banach spaces. However, the user didn't mention it, so perhaps we shouldn't assume it unless stated. Wait, the problem says T ∈ L(E,F), which is the space of bounded linear operators between normed spaces. So E and F are at least normed spaces. However, the property that weakly convergent sequences are bounded requires the space to be Banach (by the uniform boundedness principle). But the problem might not explicitly state that E is a Banach space. Hmm, the original question doesn't specify E and F as Banach, but in functional analysis, often we work with Banach spaces. However, since the user didn't specify, perhaps we should not include that as an assumption unless it's in the original problem. The original problem just says \"Prove that if T ∈ L(E,F) is compact, and if u_n ⇀ u... then T u_n → T u strongly.\"\n\nTherefore, the assumptions we need to list are:\n\n1. T is a compact operator (T ∈ L(E,F) is compact).\n2. The sequence u_n converges weakly to u in the weak topology σ(E, E*) (u_n ⇀ u).\n\nBut wait, in the example, the assumption was split into two lines: \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, the assumptions are about two different objects: T and u_n. So each gets its own line.\n\nTherefore, the formatted assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nT is a compact operator in L(E, F),\nu_n converges weakly to u in σ(E, E^*).\n\nProblem:\nProve that Tu_n converges strongly to Tu in F.\n\nWait, but in the original problem statement, the user says \"Prove that if T ∈ L(E,F) is compact, and if u_n ⇀ u ... then Tu_n → Tu strongly in F.\" So the problem is exactly that. So in the formatted version, the assumptions are T being compact and u_n converging weakly. The problem is to prove strong convergence of Tu_n.\n\nBut in the example given, the assumption included both the general condition (n is integer) and a specific one (n divisible by 7), but here we have two separate conditions on two different objects. So each should be a separate line.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure is:\n\nAssumption:\nT is a compact operator in L(E, F),\nu_n is a sequence in E that converges weakly to u.\n\nProblem:\nProve that Tu_n converges strongly to Tu in F.\n\nBut wait, in the example, they rephrased the problem statement to include the assumptions and then the problem. Let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal example problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The user formatted it with assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, but that seems incorrect because in the original problem, it's for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was not in the original problem. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect? Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal problem in example: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. Formatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that seems contradictory because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an extra condition that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. That suggests there's a mistake in the example. Perhaps the user made an error in the example.\n\nWait, perhaps the original problem was actually different? Let me recheck.\n\nThe user's example says:\n\nOriginal problem:\nProve that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nWait, this seems like the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the original problem states \"for every integer n\". That's conflicting. So perhaps there was a mistake in the example. Therefore, maybe the user intended the example to have assumptions that are actually part of the problem. Maybe the original problem had a typo, but assuming the example is correct as per their instruction, even if it's conflicting, then we need to follow the structure where assumptions are extracted from the problem statement.\n\nBut in the current problem, the original problem states \"if T ∈ L(E,F) is compact, and if u_n ⇀ u ... then Tu_n → Tu strongly\". So the assumptions here are T is compact and u_n ⇀ u. Thus, the formatted problem should list these two as assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure is:\n\nAssumption:\nT is a compact operator in L(E, F),\nu_n converges weakly to u in σ(E, E^*).\n\nProblem:\nProve that Tu_n converges strongly to Tu in F.\n\nI think that's the correct way. The user's own attempt about the subsequence is part of the original question but should be omitted in the formatted problem. So the final answer should have two assumptions and the problem as stated.",
