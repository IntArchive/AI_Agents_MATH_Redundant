    "Content": "I would appreciate any help with the following problem. let $R$ be a commutative ring (with $1$). I need to show that the following are equivalent i) for every prime ideal $P$, the localization $R_P$ is an integral domain ii) for every maximal ideal $M$, $R_M$ is an integral domain iii) for $x,y \\in R$ such that $xy = 0$ we have $Ann(x) + Ann(y) = R$ where $Ann$ denotes the annihilator ideal. Clearly, i) implies ii), and I showed that ii) implies iii). If iii) were false, then we can find $x,y \\in R$ with $xy = 0$ and $Ann(x) + Ann(y) \\subset M$ for some maximal ideal $M$. Then, in $R_M$ we have $\\frac{xy}{1} = \\frac{0}{1}$. Now, we are assuming that $R_M$ is an integral domain, hence either $\\frac{x}{1} = \\frac{0}{1}$ or $\\frac{y}{1} = \\frac{0}{1}$. Therefore, there exist $s,t \\in R-M$ such that either $sx = 0$ or $ty = 0$. But $sx = 0$ means that $s \\in Ann(x)$, hence $s \\in M$, which contradicts the fact that $s \\in R-M$. Similarly, $ty = 0$ leads to a contradiction. So ii) implies iii). I am having problems proving that iii) implies i). Let $P$ be a prime ideal of $R$ and suppose that $\\frac{x}{s} \\cdot \\frac{y}{t} =\\frac{0}{1}$. This means that there exists $z \\in R-P$ with $zxy = 0$. Now, I want to show that either $\\frac{x}{s}$ or $\\frac{y}{t}$ is equal to $0$, so I attempted to show that either $zx = 0$ or $zy = 0$. From the given assumption we have $Ann(zx) + Ann(y) = R$, but I do not see how to conclude that $Ann(zx) = R$ (or maybe this approach is not even correct). I am studying this on my own, so this is not a HW problem. I would appreciate any suggestions. Thank you in advance.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I suppose your approach is correct, but you need to be a little bit more delicate. Let us begin with a observation concerning localization in general: Lemma If $\\mathfrak{p}$ is a prime ideal, then for any $x \\in R$ such that $x/1 \\neq 0 \\in R_\\mathfrak{p}$ then $\\mathrm{Ann}(x) \\subset \\mathfrak{p}$. Proof Indeed, suppose that $t \\in \\mathrm{Ann}(x)$, or in other words $tx = 0$ and $t \\not \\in \\mathfrak{p}$. Then, $1/t$ is a valid element of $R_\\mathfrak{p}$ and we can compute:\n$$\n 0 = tx/1 \\cdot 1/t = tx/t = x/1 \\neq 0\n$$\nwhich forms the desired contradiction. $\\square$ Now, suppose as you did, that $x/s \\cdot y/t = 0 \\in R_\\mathfrak{p}$. Then you rightly conclude that $xyz = 0$ for some $z \\not \\in \\mathfrak{p}$. It will suffice to prove that $x/1 = 0$ or $y/1 = 0$. Suppose otherwise, namely that $x/1 \\neq 0$ and $y/1 \\neq 0$. Then, we argue that also $xz/1 \\neq 0$, since $z/1$ is invertible. By the lemma, we know that $$\\mathrm{Ann}(xz), \\mathrm{Ann}(y) \\subset \\mathfrak{p}$$ so $$\\mathrm{Ann}(xz) + \\mathrm{Ann}(y) \\subset \\mathfrak{p} + \\mathfrak{p} = \\mathfrak{p}$$ But from (iii) we know that $$\\mathrm{Ann}(xz) + \\mathrm{Ann}(y) = R$$ which is the desired contradiction.",

This requires proving that if $\\frac{x}{s} \\cdot \\frac{y}{t} = \\frac{0}{1}$ in $R_P$, then either $\\frac{x}{s} = \\frac{0}{1}$ or $\\frac{y}{t} = \\frac{0}{1}$.\n\n2. **Localization Condition:** $\\frac{x}{s} \\cdot \\frac{y}{t} = \\frac{0}{1}$ implies there exists $z \\in R \\setminus P$ such that $zxy = 0$ in $R$.\n\n3. **Apply Given Property (iii):** Since $zxy = 0$, property (iii) gives $Ann(zx) + Ann(y) = R$. Thus, there exist $a \\in Ann(zx)$ and $b \\in Ann(y)$ such that $a + b = 1$.\n\n4. **Prime Ideal Property:** Since $P$ is prime and $a + b = 1 \\notin P$, at least one of $a$ or $b$ is not in $P$.\n   - **Case 1:** If $a \\notin P$, then $a \\in Ann(zx)$ (i.e., $azx = 0$). In $R_P$, $a$ is a unit (as $a \\notin P$), so $\\frac{zx}{1} = 0$. Since $z$ is also a unit in $R_P$, this forces $\\frac{x}{1} = 0$, hence $\\frac{x}{s} = 0$.\n   - **Case 2:** If $b \\notin P$, then $b \\in Ann(y)$ (i.e., $by = 0$). In $R_P$, $b$ is a unit, so $\\frac{y}{1} = 0$, hence $\\frac{y}{t} = 0$.\n\n5. **Conclusion:** In both cases, one of $\\frac{x}{s}$ or $\\frac{y}{t}$ must be zero in $R_P$, proving $R_P$ is an integral domain. Thus, (iii) $\\implies$ (i).",
    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. The user wants to show that three statements are equivalent for a commutative ring R with 1. The key part they're stuck on is proving that iii) implies i). Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the problem states that for a commutative ring R, the following are equivalent:\ni) Every localization R_P at a prime ideal P is an integral domain.\nii) Every localization R_M at a maximal ideal M is an integral domain.\niii) For any x, y in R with xy=0, the annihilators Ann(x) and Ann(y) are comaximal, meaning Ann(x) + Ann(y) = R.\n\nThe user has already shown i) implies ii) and ii) implies iii). Now, they need to show iii) implies i). \n\nSo, let's focus on iii) implies i). To prove i), we need to show that for any prime ideal P, the localization R_P is an integral domain. Let's recall that a ring is an integral domain if it has no zero divisors. So, in R_P, if the product of two elements is zero, one of them must be zero.\n\nGiven a prime ideal P, and suppose in R_P, we have two elements x/s and y/t such that their product is zero. That means (x/s)*(y/t) = 0/1 in R_P. By the definition of localization, this implies there exists some z not in P (i.e., z ∈ R - P) such that zxy = 0 in R. \n\nNow, since zxy = 0, we can apply condition iii). The annihilators Ann(zx) and Ann(y) should be comaximal, i.e., Ann(zx) + Ann(y) = R. Similarly, Ann(x) and Ann(zy) would be comaximal? Wait, maybe. Let me check. The original condition iii) says that if ab=0, then Ann(a) + Ann(b) = R. Here, zxy = 0. Let me let a = zx and b = y. Then, since (zx)y = 0, by iii), Ann(zx) + Ann(y) = R.\n\nSince R is a ring and Ann(zx) + Ann(y) = R, then there exist elements a in Ann(zx) and b in Ann(y) such that a + b = 1. But how does this help in showing that either x/s or y/t is zero in R_P?\n\nIf we can show that either zx = 0 or y = 0 in R_P, but z is already not in P, so maybe we need to find an element not in P that annihilates either x or y. Let me think.\n\nSince Ann(zx) + Ann(y) = R, their sum is R. So, 1 can be written as the sum of an element from Ann(zx) and an element from Ann(y). Let's say 1 = a + b where a ∈ Ann(zx) and b ∈ Ann(y). So, a*zx = 0 and b*y = 0.\n\nNow, since P is a prime ideal, and z is not in P, and we have 1 = a + b. If both a and b were in P, then 1 would be in P, which is impossible because P is a prime (hence proper) ideal. Therefore, at least one of a or b is not in P.\n\nCase 1: a not in P. Then, a is in Ann(zx), so a*zx = 0. Since a is not in P and we are localizing at P, in R_P, the element a is invertible (since denominators are R - P). Therefore, in R_P, (zx)/1 = 0 because a*(zx) = 0 implies (zx)/1 = 0/(a) = 0. But z is already a unit in R_P (as z is not in P), so multiplying by z^{-1}, we get x/1 = 0 in R_P. Therefore, x/s = (x/1)*(1/s) = 0 in R_P.\n\nCase 2: b not in P. Similarly, b ∈ Ann(y), so b*y = 0. Then, in R_P, since b is invertible, y/1 = 0. Hence, y/t = 0 in R_P.\n\nTherefore, in either case, either x/s = 0 or y/t = 0 in R_P. This shows that R_P is an integral domain because the product of two non-zero elements cannot be zero. Hence, iii) implies i).\n\nWait, the user mentioned they tried to show that either zx=0 or zy=0, but maybe they didn't consider splitting 1 into a + b from the annihilators. The key step is using that Ann(zx) + Ann(y) = R and then deducing that one of the annihilators must contain an element not in P, leading to either x or y being zero in the localization. This seems like the right approach. So the main idea is using the comaximality to split 1 into annihilators, then using the prime ideal's property to ensure one term is outside P, allowing the conclusion that one of the fractions must be zero.",
