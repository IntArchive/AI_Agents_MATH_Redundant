    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem correctly. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into their specified format. The example they provided shows that the assumptions should list each condition or property applied to one object per line, and then the problem statement.\n\nFirst, looking at the original problem from Math Stack Exchange. The title is about evaluating an integral involving dilogarithms. The question body repeats the integral and mentions that numerically it's close to -49/24 times ζ(3), and asks how to prove that this is the exact value.\n\nSo, I need to extract the assumptions here. The integral is from 0 to 1, and the integrand is a difference of two dilogarithms divided by z. The function involved is Li₂, the dilogarithm. The user didn't state any explicit assumptions beyond what's in the integral, but maybe there are implicit assumptions. For example, the dilogarithm function is defined for complex arguments except on the branch cut, which is usually from 1 to infinity. In the integrand, the arguments are -1/(1-z) and -1/(1+z). When z is in [0,1], we need to check if these arguments are within the domain of convergence for the dilogarithm series or if there are any singularities.\n\nBut the problem as stated doesn't mention any restrictions, so maybe the main assumption is that the integral is well-defined over the interval [0,1]. So perhaps the assumptions are that the integrand is defined and integrable over [0,1]. Also, that Li₂ is the standard dilogarithm function. However, since the problem is about proving the integral equals a specific value, maybe there are no additional assumptions beyond the integral's setup.\n\nWait, the example given had assumptions like n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in this integral problem, the user hasn't specified any parameters or variables other than the integration variable z. So maybe the assumptions here are just about the domain of integration and the definition of the dilogarithm function. But according to the example, each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is taken over the interval [0,1],\nThe integrand involves the dilogarithm function Li₂,\nThe arguments of Li₂ are -1/(1-z) and -1/(1+z) for z in [0,1].\n\nBut maybe that's too detailed. Alternatively, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nz is a real variable in the interval [0,1],\nLi₂ denotes the dilogarithm function.\n\nBut the problem statement already includes the integral from 0 to 1, so the first assumption might be redundant. Wait, the example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the problem statement mentioned \"for every integer n\". Maybe the assumptions should list all the conditions, even if they're in the problem statement. So in the example, the problem says \"for every integer n\", but the assumption still lists \"n is an integer\". So following that, here, even though the integral is from 0 to 1, the assumption should list \"z is in [0,1]\" as an assumption.\n\nWait, but in the example, the problem statement says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption still lists \"n is an integer\". So following that pattern, here, the problem statement says \"integral from 0 to 1\", so the assumption should list \"z is a real variable in the interval [0,1]\".\n\nAlso, since the integrand uses the dilogarithm function, another assumption would be that Li₂ is the dilogarithm function. But in the example, they didn't restate that Li₂ is the dilogarithm, but in the formatted problem, they might include it. Wait, the example's problem statement mentions \"where Li₂(z) is the dilogarithm function\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption includes \"n is an integer\", \"n is divisible by 7\", and the problem statement repeats the expression with Li₂.\n\nHmm, perhaps in this case, the assumption should include that Li₂ is the dilogarithm function, but in the example, the original problem states that, but in the formatted problem, they didn't include that as an assumption. Wait, looking at the example again:\n\nOriginal problem mentions \"where Li₂(z) is the dilogarithm function\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption is only about n being an integer and divisible by 7. So maybe the function definitions are considered part of the problem statement, not assumptions. So perhaps in this problem, the assumptions are only about the variables and their domains.\n\nSo here, the integral is over z from 0 to 1. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nz is a real variable in the interval [0,1],\nLi₂ denotes the dilogarithm function.\n\nBut maybe the key is to list each assumption line by line. Since the example listed two separate assumptions for n (integer and divisible by 7), here perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe variable z is integrated from 0 to 1,\nThe function Li₂ is the dilogarithm function,\nThe integrand is well-defined for all z in [0,1].\n\nBut I need to check if there's any implicit assumption. For example, when z approaches 1, the term 1/(1-z) goes to infinity. So the argument of Li₂(-1/(1-z)) as z approaches 1 would be approaching -∞, but the dilogarithm function has a branch cut on the real axis from 1 to ∞. So near z=1, the argument -1/(1-z) becomes a large negative number, which is okay because the branch cut is from 1 to ∞, but here we're at -∞, which is fine. Wait, Li₂ is defined for all complex numbers except on the branch cut, which is typically from 1 to ∞. So arguments less than or equal to 1 are okay. Wait, when z approaches 1 from below, 1-z approaches 0 from the positive side, so -1/(1-z) approaches -∞. But the dilogarithm function's series converges for |z| ≤ 1 and z ≠ 1. For |z| > 1, it's defined via analytic continuation. So maybe the integral is improper at z=1, but the problem states it's from 0 to 1, implying it's a definite integral that converges.\n\nSo perhaps the assumption is that the integral converges. But the user might expect that as part of the problem's given. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the integral is convergent. So perhaps include that as an assumption.\n\nBut the example didn't include convergence assumptions. For instance, the original example was about divisibility, so convergence wasn't an issue. Here, maybe the integral's convergence is part of the problem, but since the user is asking to prove the value, they probably assume the integral exists. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral converges,\nLi₂ denotes the dilogarithm function.\n\nBut how to split into separate lines. Each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is taken over the interval [0, 1],\nLi₂ is the dilogarithm function,\nThe integrand is integrable over [0, 1].\n\nBut the problem statement already mentions the integral from 0 to 1, so maybe the first assumption is redundant. However, following the example, they included \"n is an integer\" even though the problem states \"for every integer n\". So perhaps even if it's in the problem statement, it's listed as an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are only the implicit ones not stated in the problem. The example's problem statement didn't say that n is divisible by 7; that was an additional assumption. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem's assumption includes that n is divisible by 7, which changes the problem. Wait, that example might have been a mistake. Wait, the user wrote:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which restricts n. That seems like an error. Maybe the example is incorrect, but the user provided it as their structure. So following that, perhaps in the current problem, even if the problem statement includes certain conditions, we need to list them as assumptions. So for the integral from 0 to 1, the assumption would be \"The integral is evaluated from z = 0 to z = 1\", and other assumptions related to the functions involved.\n\nBut given the example's structure, even redundant information from the problem statement is listed in assumptions. So perhaps here, we should list:\n\nAssumption:\nz is integrated from 0 to 1,\nLi₂ is the dilogarithm function,\nThe expression inside the integral is well-defined for all z in [0, 1).\n\nBut the problem statement already says \"integrate from 0 to 1\", so the first assumption is redundant but listed as per the example. The second assumption is that Li₂ is the dilogarithm function, which is mentioned in the problem statement. The third assumption is about the integrand being well-defined, which might be implicit.\n\nAlternatively, since the example included assumptions that were not in the original problem (like n divisible by 7), maybe the user wants to extract all conditions from the problem statement, even if they are explicitly stated.\n\nBut in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake, but perhaps the example was illustrative of structuring, not accuracy. So perhaps the user's example is incorrect, but we have to follow their format regardless.\n\nGiven that, for the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated over the interval z ∈ [0, 1],\nLi₂ denotes the dilogarithm function,\nThe integrand is defined for all z in [0, 1].\n\nProblem: Prove that the integral equals -49/24 ζ(3).\n\nBut the problem statement as given by the user is: How can we prove that -49/24 ζ(3) is the exact value of the integral?\n\nSo the formatted problem should have the assumptions extracted and the problem restated.\n\nTherefore, final answer would be:\n\nAssumption:\nz is a real variable in the interval [0, 1],\nLi₂ denotes the dilogarithm function,\nThe integrand is integrable over [0, 1].\n\nProblem: Prove that $$\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\text{Li}_2 \\left(-\\frac{1}{1-z}\\right)-\\text{Li}_2 \\left(-\\frac{1}{1+z}\\right)}{z}dz = -\\frac{49}{24}\\zeta(3).$$\n\nBut to check against the example: the example's assumptions listed properties of n, even though the problem statement said \"for every integer n\". Similarly here, even though the problem says \"integral from 0 to 1\", we list \"z is in [0,1]\" as an assumption. And the dilogarithm function is mentioned as an assumption. Then the problem is to prove the integral equals that value.",
