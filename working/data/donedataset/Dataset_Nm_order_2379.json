    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So the question is about proving that every holomorphic function from a compact complex manifold M to the complex numbers is constant. Hmm, I remember something about complex analysis and compactness. Let me recall what I know.\n\nFirst, in complex analysis, Liouville's theorem says that a bounded entire function on the complex plane is constant. But this is about manifolds, not just the plane. Then there's the maximum modulus principle, which states that a non-constant holomorphic function on an open set doesn't attain its maximum modulus there. But how does that apply to compact manifolds?\n\nWait, compactness in topology means that every open cover has a finite subcover. But for complex manifolds, being compact implies that any holomorphic function might have certain restrictions. If M is a compact complex manifold, then it's closed and bounded in some sense. But how does that affect holomorphic functions?\n\nOh! There's a theorem called the maximum principle for holomorphic functions on compact complex manifolds. Since M is compact, the function's modulus would attain a maximum somewhere on M. But by the maximum modulus principle, if the function is holomorphic and not constant, then the maximum modulus can't be attained in the interior of the manifold. Wait, but if the manifold is compact without boundary, then every point is an interior point. So if the modulus has a maximum at some point, that would imply the function is constant everywhere. That might be the key.\n\nWait, but the maximum modulus principle in several complex variables. Let me think. For a holomorphic function on a connected compact complex manifold, the function must be constant because the maximum modulus would be achieved on the manifold, which can't happen unless the function is constant. But is the manifold connected here? The original problem just says \"compact complex manifold\". Usually, when talking about such theorems, connectedness is required. Does the problem assume M is connected?\n\nLooking back at the original question: \"every holomorphic function M→ℂ on a compact complex manifold M is constant\". The question doesn't explicitly state that M is connected. Hmm, that's a problem. Because if M is disconnected, a function could be constant on each connected component but different constants on different components. So maybe the assumption should include that M is connected. But the user's example didn't mention connectedness. Let me check the standard theorem.\n\nIn standard complex analysis, the result that holomorphic functions on a compact connected complex manifold are constant is a well-known result. For example, on the Riemann sphere, the only holomorphic functions are constants. But the Riemann sphere is compact and connected. So perhaps the original problem assumes connectedness. However, the user's problem as stated does not include \"connected\". Maybe that's an error, or maybe it's implied. Wait, maybe in the case of disconnected compact complex manifolds, the functions can be locally constant, hence constant on each connected component. But globally, they can be different. So if the manifold is disconnected, the functions are not necessarily constant. Therefore, the theorem must require connectedness.\n\nSo the problem as stated might be missing the connectedness assumption. But the user's formatted example didn't include that. Wait, the example was about divisibility by 91 and had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Maybe the original problem had a missing assumption, which the formatter included. Similarly, here, perhaps the correct assumption is that M is a compact connected complex manifold. But in the original question, the user wrote \"on a compact complex manifold M\" without mentioning connectedness. So perhaps the answer should include the connectedness assumption. However, maybe in some contexts, compact complex manifold is assumed to be connected. But I don't think so. Usually, compactness doesn't imply connectedness.\n\nTherefore, to correctly answer the problem, the assumption should include that M is connected. But the original question didn't state that. So there's a conflict here. Let me check the original problem again. The title is \"Holomorphic functions on a complex compact manifold are only constants\". The question is: \"Is there a simple proof that every holomorphic function M→ℂ on a compact complex manifold M is constant?\" The user is asking for a proof. The standard theorem requires connectedness. Therefore, either the problem is missing an assumption, or maybe there's a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the case of compact complex manifolds, even if disconnected, holomorphic functions are constant on each component. So globally, they are not necessarily constant, but locally constant. However, the problem states that every holomorphic function is constant. That can't be true unless the manifold is connected. Therefore, the problem as stated is incorrect unless M is connected. So the assumption should include that M is connected. Therefore, the formatted problem should list that as an assumption.\n\nBut the user's example didn't include such an implicit assumption. For example, in the example given, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no. The original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like a mistake. Because if n is any integer, then A(n) is divisible by 91. But the user's example in the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which changes the problem. Wait, maybe that was an error. Because the original problem didn't say \"n divisible by 7\", it's for every integer n. So maybe the example is wrong. Therefore, perhaps the user is mistaken in their example, and the correct formatting should not add extra assumptions. Wait, the user's example says:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut this is incorrect, because the original problem's assumption is that n is any integer, but the formatted problem adds that n is divisible by 7, changing the problem. That seems like a mistake. So perhaps the user made an error in their example. Therefore, when they ask me to format the problem, I should not add incorrect assumptions. So, going back to the current problem.\n\nThe original question is: \"Is there a simple proof that every holomorphic function M→ℂ on a compact complex manifold M is constant?\"\n\nAssuming that the standard theorem requires connectedness, then the formatted problem should include that assumption. However, the original problem does not mention connectedness. So perhaps the problem is incorrectly stated, and the answer would point out that connectedness is needed. But since the user wants to structure the problem as per their example, which added an assumption not in the original (divisible by 7), maybe in this case, the assumption should be that M is connected. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption: M is a compact complex manifold,\n\nM is connected.\n\nProblem: Prove that every holomorphic function M→ℂ is constant.\n\nAlternatively, if connectedness is part of the definition of a manifold in this context, but usually, manifolds can be disconnected. So probably, the correct formatted problem should include M being connected as an assumption. Therefore, even though the original question didn't state it, the structured problem should include it. Alternatively, if the user's example added an assumption not present in the original, maybe they expect the same here. But in their example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", and the formatted assumption includes \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But that changes the problem. So perhaps the example is wrong, but following it, maybe the user wants to extract assumptions from the problem, not add new ones. Wait, the user's instruction says: \"filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format\". So perhaps the task is to extract the assumptions present in the problem, not add new ones. But in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which is an assumption that n is any integer. But in the formatted problem, it lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But wait, the original problem's assumption is \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumptions are \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. Unless there's a mistake in the example. Because the original problem wants to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but if you assume n is divisible by 7, then you're only proving it for multiples of 7, which is a different problem. So maybe the example provided by the user is incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the user intended that the assumptions are those present in the problem, not added ones. Therefore, in the current problem, the original question states that M is a compact complex manifold, and the problem is to prove that every holomorphic function on M is constant. So the assumptions should be:\n\nM is a compact complex manifold,\n\nf: M→ℂ is holomorphic.\n\nProblem: Prove that f is constant.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to prove that every holomorphic function is constant, so the assumptions are that M is compact complex, and f is holomorphic. But maybe the problem is missing connectedness. However, the original question didn't mention connectedness, so perhaps the answer should point that out. But according to the user's instruction, I should structure the problem as per the format, filtering unrelated info. The original question title is \"Holomorphic functions on a complex compact manifold are only constants\", and the problem is asking for a simple proof. So perhaps the connectedness is considered implicit. For example, in the statement of the theorem, usually, the manifold is connected. But if it's not, then the conclusion is that the function is locally constant, hence constant on each connected component. But the problem says \"every holomorphic function... is constant\", which would require connectedness. Therefore, to answer the problem correctly, M must be connected, so the assumption should include that. Even if the original problem didn't state it. But according to the user's example, they added an assumption not present in the original problem. So perhaps the user expects that sometimes the original problem has missing assumptions and we need to include them. However, in the example given, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Because the original problem's conclusion is that A(n) is divisible by 91, which is 7*13. If n is divisible by 7, then 5^n and 6^n would have factors related to 7, but the original problem is for all integers n. So the example might be incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the user wants to extract the assumptions present in the problem, not add new ones. Therefore, in the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\nM is a compact complex manifold,\n\nf: M→ℂ is holomorphic.\n\nProblem: Prove that f is constant.\n\nBut then, this is only true if M is connected. Therefore, the problem as stated is missing an assumption. However, the original question didn't mention connectedness. Therefore, there's a conflict. If I follow the user's example, which added an assumption not present in the original, then maybe I should add M being connected here. But I need to decide based on the user's instructions. The user says: \"filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format\". So \"filtered the unrelated information\" implies removing irrelevant parts, not adding new assumptions. Therefore, perhaps in the example, the original problem had a mistake, and the user corrected it by adding an assumption. But if that's the case, then perhaps here we should not add connectedness unless it's mentioned. But the problem is, without connectedness, the conclusion is false. Therefore, maybe the original problem implicitly assumes connectedness, and it's considered part of the definition of a manifold in this context. However, usually, manifolds can be disconnected unless stated otherwise. So this is a problem. Therefore, to answer correctly, the formatted problem should include the connectedness assumption. But since the original question didn't state it, I'm in a dilemma. However, following mathematical rigor, the correct assumptions should include connectedness. Therefore, the formatted problem should list:\n\nAssumption: M is a compact complex manifold,\n\nM is connected,\n\nf: M→ℂ is holomorphic.\n\nProblem: Prove that f is constant.\n\nBut the original problem didn't mention connectedness, so is this adding an assumption? Yes. But according to the user's example, they added an assumption (n divisible by 7) not present in the original problem. Therefore, maybe the user expects that sometimes we need to include necessary assumptions even if not stated. In that case, here, adding M is connected is necessary for the problem to hold. Therefore, I will include it. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: M is a compact complex manifold,\n\nM is connected,\n\nf: M→ℂ is holomorphic.\n\nProblem: Prove that f is constant.\n\nBut the original problem states \"every holomorphic function M→ℂ\", so the function f is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Therefore, maybe the assumptions are only on M, and the problem is about any holomorphic function. So the assumptions should be:\n\nM is a compact complex manifold,\n\nM is connected.\n\nProblem: Prove that every holomorphic function f: M→ℂ is constant.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because the function f is quantified in the problem statement (\"every holomorphic function\"), so the assumptions are on M. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: M is a compact complex manifold,\n\nM is connected.\n\nProblem: Prove that every holomorphic function M→ℂ is constant.\n\nThis way, the assumptions are the properties of M, and the problem is about all functions f. So, in conclusion, the answer should list the compactness and connectedness of M as assumptions, and the problem is to prove that all holomorphic functions on M are constant.",
