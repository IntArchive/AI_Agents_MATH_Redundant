    "Content": "This is an old homework problem of mine that I was never able to solve.  The solution may or may not involve the Baire category theorem, which I am terrible at applying. Let $C[0, 1]$ denote the space of continuous functions $[0, 1] \\to \\mathbb{R}$.  Suppose $|| \\cdot ||$ is a norm on $C[0, 1]$ with respect to which the evaluation functions $f \\mapsto f(x), x \\in [0, 1]$ are continuous.  Show that the topology induced by $|| \\cdot ||$ is the same as the usual topology induced by the sup norm. It is straightforward to show that any sequence converging uniformly converges with respect to $|| \\cdot ||$.  I am stuck on proving the converse; I cannot seem to figure out how to use the assumption that $|| \\cdot ||$ is a norm. Edit:  Zhen Lin informs me that $|| \\cdot ||$ is supposed to be complete.  That should make the problem statement true now!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here's $\\DeclareMathOperator{\\ev}{ev}$ the answer if $(C[0,1], \\|\\cdot\\|)$ is assumed to be complete. Consider the family $\\mathcal{F} = \\{\\ev_{x}\\}_{x \\in [0,1]}$ of continuous linear functionals on $(C[0,1],\\|\\cdot\\|)$. For each $f \\in C[0,1]$ we have $\\sup_{x \\in [0,1]} |\\ev_{x}(f)| \\leq \\|f\\|_{\\infty}$, so the family $\\mathcal{F}$ is pointwise bounded . By the uniform boundedness principle the family is uniformly bounded , that is to say $\\sup_{x \\in [0,1]} \\|\\ev_{x}\\| \\leq M$ for some constant $M$. On the other hand $|f(x)| = |\\ev_{x}(f)| \\leq \\|ev_{x}\\|\\|f\\| \\leq M \\|f\\|$ gives $\\|f\\|_{\\infty} = \\sup_{x \\in [0,1]} |f(x)| \\leq M\\|f\\|$, so the identity $(C[0,1], \\|\\cdot\\|) \\to (C[0,1],\\|\\cdot\\|_{\\infty})$ has norm at most $M$. Since both spaces are complete, we may apply the open mapping theorem in order to conclude that its inverse is also continuous. In other words, the norms $\\|\\cdot\\|$ and $\\|\\cdot\\|_{\\infty}$ are equivalent. Edit. Here's an example that shows that completeness of the norm is necessary: Choose a discontinuous linear functional $\\varphi: (C[0,1],\\|\\cdot\\|_{\\infty}) \\to \\mathbb{R}$ and define a norm on $C[0,1]$ by\n\\[\n\\|f\\| = \\|f\\|_{\\infty} + |\\varphi(f)|.\n\\]\nSince $\\|f\\|_{\\infty} \\leq \\|f\\|$, we have that the identity $(C[0,1],\\|\\cdot\\|) \\to (C[0,1],\\|\\cdot\\|_{\\infty})$ is continuous. Since the evaluation functionals are continuous with respect to the sup-norm, they are also continuous with respect to the norm $\\|\\cdot\\|$. But as $\\varphi$ is discontinuous, there is a sequence $f_{n}$ with $\\|f_{n}\\|_{\\infty} = 1$ and $|\\varphi(f_{n})| \\to \\infty$, hence the norms cannot be equivalent. Of course, $\\|\\cdot\\|$ cannot be complete because the last sentence would be in contradiction to the open mapping theorem. Edit 2. I forgot to argue why the topologies in the above counterexample are not the same. This is obvious: The functional $\\varphi$ is continuous with respect to $\\|\\cdot\\|$ but it isn't continuous with respect to $\\|\\cdot\\|_{\\infty}$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format, listing assumptions line by line and then the problem statement. \n\nFirst, I need to read through the original problem carefully. The title is \"Norms on C[0, 1] inducing the same topology as the sup norm.\" The question mentions that it's about showing that a certain norm ||·|| on C[0,1], which makes the evaluation maps continuous, induces the same topology as the sup norm. The user also mentions that it's an old homework problem and provides some context, including that they couldn't solve it before and that Zhen Lin noted the norm should be complete.\n\nNow, the task is to filter out the unnecessary information and structure the problem as per the example. The example had two parts: Assumptions and Problem. Each assumption is a single condition applied to one object. \n\nLooking at the problem statement, the key elements are:\n\n1. The space is C[0,1], the space of continuous functions from [0,1] to R.\n2. ||·|| is a norm on C[0,1].\n3. The evaluation maps f ↦ f(x) are continuous with respect to this norm for all x in [0,1].\n4. The problem is to show that the topology induced by ||·|| is the same as the usual sup norm topology.\n5. An additional note mentions that ||·|| is supposed to be complete, which the user added after Zhen Lin's input.\n\nSo, the assumptions need to be listed one by one. Let's break them down:\n\n- C[0,1] is the space of continuous functions [0,1] → ℝ.\n- ||·|| is a norm on C[0,1].\n- The evaluation maps f ↦ f(x) are continuous with respect to ||·|| for each x ∈ [0,1].\n- ||·|| is a complete norm (since the user added that after the edit).\n\nWait, the original problem didn't explicitly state that ||·|| is complete; the user mentioned that Zhen Lin informed them, so that's an added condition. Therefore, the completeness of the norm is an assumption needed for the problem to hold true, as per the user's correction.\n\nThe problem is to show that the topology induced by ||·|| is the same as the sup norm topology. \n\nNow, structuring this:\n\nAssumptions:\n- $C[0, 1]$ is the space of continuous functions $[0, 1] \\to \\mathbb{R}$.\n- $|| \\cdot ||$ is a norm on $C[0, 1]$.\n- The evaluation functionals $f \\mapsto f(x)$ are continuous with respect to $|| \\cdot ||$ for all $x \\in [0, 1]$.\n- $|| \\cdot ||$ is a complete norm.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the topology induced by $|| \\cdot ||$ is the same as the topology induced by the sup norm on $C[0, 1]$.\n\nWait, but in the original problem statement, the user says \"Suppose ||·|| is a norm on C[0,1] with respect to which the evaluation functions are continuous. Show that the topology induced by ||·|| is the same as the usual topology...\" Then, in the edit, the user adds that ||·|| is supposed to be complete. So the completeness is part of the problem's assumptions now.\n\nSo, in the original problem, the assumptions are:\n\n1. C[0,1] is as usual.\n2. ||·|| is a norm on C[0,1].\n3. For every x in [0,1], the evaluation map at x is continuous in the ||·|| norm.\n4. ||·|| is complete (as per the edit).\n\nTherefore, these four points should be the assumptions. Each is a separate line. The problem is to show the topologies are the same.\n\nSo, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n$C[0, 1]$ is the space of continuous functions $[0, 1] \\to \\mathbb{R}$,\n$|| \\cdot ||$ is a norm on $C[0, 1]$,\nThe evaluation functionals $f \\mapsto f(x)$ are continuous with respect to $|| \\cdot ||$ for all $x \\in [0, 1]$,\n$|| \\cdot ||$ is a complete norm.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the topology induced by $|| \\cdot ||$ is the same as the usual topology induced by the sup norm on $C[0, 1]$.\n\nI need to check if each assumption is only one condition per line. Yes:\n\n1. The space definition.\n2. The norm is given.\n3. Continuity of evaluation maps.\n4. Completeness of the norm.\n\nEach is a separate condition. The problem is to show equivalence of topologies. That seems correct.\n\nSo the final formatted problem should look like that.",
