    "Content": "I have one proof of the following statement, and I would like to know if there is a simpler proof.  I am not sure if “simpler” is the right word or not but, for the purpose of this question, I prefer an elementary proof rather than a short proof depending on a powerful and difficult-to-prove theorem. For any integer $n \\ge 171$, there exists an integer $m$ coprime to $n$ satisfying  $n\\lt m^2 \\lt 2n$. The proof which I have actually gives an additional guarantee that $m$ is a prime.  I do not need this guarantee and want a simpler proof if there is one. My proof uses the method used by Nagura [Nag52], which I suspect may be overkill for this purpose.  By the same argument as the one in [Nag52], we can prove that for every $x \\geq 16769$, there exists a prime between $x$ and $2^\\frac 14 x$, and we can verify that the same conclusion holds for $x \\ge 32$ by calculation.  This implies that for $n \\ge 32^2=1024$, there exist at least two primes between $\\sqrt{n}$ and $\\sqrt{2n}$.  Because both primes are greater than $\\sqrt{n}$, at least one of them must be coprime to $n$.  The case of  $171 \\le n \\le 1023$ can be verified by calculation. Is there a simpler proof of the statement above? [Nag52] Jitsuro Nagura. On the interval containing at least one prime number. Proceedings of the Japan Academy , 28(4):177–181, 1952 .",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I will show what you want for sufficiently large $n$. First question:  How many squares are between $n$ and $2n$.  Well we have $$\\#\\text{of squares}=\\lceil\\sqrt{2n}-1\\rceil-\\lceil\\sqrt{n}-1\\rceil\\geq\\sqrt{2n}-\\sqrt{n}-2=(\\sqrt{2}-1)\\sqrt{n}-2\\geq \\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{3}$$ for sufficiently large $n$.  So lets look at the square roots of these squares, which form a sequence of more than $\\sqrt{n}/3$ consecutive integers.  (This is fine since $\\gcd(n,m)=1$ if and only if $\\gcd(n^2,m)=1$)  The goal is then to show that one of these integers in this sequence is relatively prime to $n$. Recall the elementary Eratosthenes-Legendre sieve which says that: Theorem: For any real $x$ and any $y\\geq 0$, we have $$S(x,y;n)=\\frac{\\phi(n)}{n}y+O\\left(2^{\\omega(n)}\\right)$$ where $S(x,y;n)$ is the number of integers $m$ in the interval $x<m\\leq x+y$ for which $(n,m)=1$. Using this theorem, combined with the fact that $2^{\\omega(n)}\\ll_{\\epsilon} n^\\epsilon$, and the fact that $$\\frac{\\phi(n)}{n}\\geq \\frac{C}{\\log\\log n},\\ \\ (C>0)$$ the result then follows for sufficiently large $n$. Notice that this proof generalizes to show that for any $k$, there exists $N$ such that for any $n>N$ there exists $m\\in \\left(\\sqrt[k]{n},\\ \\sqrt[k]{2n}\\right)$ for which $\\gcd(m,n)=1$.  In other words, we can show: For any $k$, taking $n$ large enough guarantees that there will be a $k^{th}$ power between $n$ and $2n$ that is also relatively prime to $n$. Hope that helps, Remark: The key fact which makes this proof work is that $2^{\\omega(n)}\\ll_\\epsilon n^\\epsilon$ for every $\\epsilon$.  The Eratosthenes-Legendre Sieve is really what you get when you try the simplest approach to evaluating $S(x,y;n)$.  It follows directly from the inclusion-exclusion principle. Added Proof: Why is it true that  $$\\frac{\\phi(n)}{n}\\geq \\frac{e^{-\\gamma}}{\\log\\log n}+O\\left(\\frac{1}{(\\log\\log n)^2}\\right)?$$  This follows from Mertens formulas along with Chebyshevs estimates.  The error term can be removed by making the constant smaller, which is what I wrote down above, but lets prove this form. \nLook at the $n$ which minimize $\\phi(n)/n$ for their size.  These will be of the form $$\\prod_{p\\leq y}p,$$ that is the product of the first few primes. (*Prove these numbers do indeed minimize) Taking logarithms introduces $\\theta(y)$, so we can deduce $\\log \\log n = \\log y +O(1)$ by Chebyshevs estimate.  Next $$\\frac{n}{\\phi(n)}=\\prod_{p\\leq y}=\\left( 1-\\frac{1}{p}\\right)^{-1}=e^\\gamma\\log y+O(1)$$ is one of Mertens formulas. Taking reciprocals yields $$\\frac{\\phi(n)}{n} = \\frac{e^{-\\gamma}}{\\log \\log n} + O\\left(\\frac{1}{(\\log \\log n)^2}\\right)$$ as desired. That result is actually stronger than we need.  All the above proof required was that $n^{-\\epsilon}\\ll_\\epsilon\\phi(n)/n$ for every $\\epsilon$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let's start by reading through the problem carefully.\n\nThe user's question is about proving that for any integer n ≥ 171, there exists an integer m coprime to n such that √n < m < √(2n). They mention having a proof that uses Nagura's method, which involves primes between certain intervals, but they want a simpler elementary proof without relying on such theorems. They also mention verifying cases for n between 171 and 1023 by calculation, but the main focus is on the general proof for n ≥ 171.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that n is an integer, n is greater than or equal to 171, and m is an integer that must be coprime to n. Additionally, m must satisfy √n < m < √(2n). Wait, the original problem says \"there exists an integer m coprime to n satisfying n < m² < 2n\". Wait, that translates to m² being between n and 2n, so m would be between √n and √(2n). So the conditions are that m is an integer, m² is between n and 2n, and m is coprime to n. The user wants to prove that such an m exists for all n ≥ 171.\n\nSo the assumptions here are:\n\n1. n is an integer.\n2. n ≥ 171.\n3. m is an integer.\n4. m satisfies √n < m < √(2n) (or equivalently, n < m² < 2n).\n5. m and n are coprime (gcd(m, n) = 1).\n\nBut wait, the problem is to prove that such an m exists given n ≥ 171. So the problem's assumptions are just on n, and the conclusion is the existence of m with those properties. Therefore, the assumptions should list the conditions that n must satisfy, and the problem statement is about proving that under those conditions, such an m exists.\n\nSo the Assumption section should include:\n\n- n is an integer.\n- n is greater than or equal to 171.\n\nThe problem then is to prove that there exists an integer m coprime to n such that n < m² < 2n. Alternatively, phrased as m being between √n and √(2n), but since m must be an integer, it's the same as m² in (n, 2n).\n\nWait, but the original problem states \"there exists an integer m coprime to n satisfying n < m² < 2n\". So the problem is to show that for n ≥ 171, there exists such an m. The user's own proof uses primes in certain intervals, but they want a simpler method.\n\nSo to format this:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn is greater than or equal to 171.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists an integer m coprime to n such that n < m² < 2n.\n\nWait, but in the example provided by the user, they had to adjust the original problem's assumptions. In their example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem included \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. However, in the original example, the user probably made a mistake, or maybe there was a misinterpretation. Wait, the original problem in the example was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, an assumption was added that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect. Let me check that again.\n\nOriginal example:\n\nOriginal problem:\nProve that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which restricts n. That would be a mistake. However, perhaps the example was a mistake. But maybe the user intended to show that perhaps in their example, the problem had a missing assumption, and they added it. However, in the current problem, the user's question is correctly stated as for n ≥ 171, so we shouldn't add extra assumptions.\n\nTherefore, for the current problem, the correct assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn is greater than or equal to 171.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists an integer m coprime to n such that n < m² < 2n.\n\nBut let me check the original problem statement again. The user wrote: \"For any integer n ≥ 171, there exists an integer m coprime to n satisfying n < m² < 2n.\" So that's exactly the problem. Therefore, the assumptions are n is integer and n ≥ 171. The problem is to prove existence of m with m² in that range and coprime to n.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn is greater than or equal to 171.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists an integer m coprime to n such that n < m² < 2n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement should be written as:\n\nProve that for any integer n ≥ 171, there exists an integer m coprime to n satisfying √n < m < √(2n).\n\nBut since m must be an integer, the condition n < m² < 2n is equivalent. But perhaps in the problem statement, the user wrote \"n < m² < 2n\", so we should follow that.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should have the assumptions as n being integer and ≥171, and the problem is to show there's an m coprime to n with m² between n and 2n.",
