    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem step by step. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format, which includes listing assumptions line by line and then stating the problem.\n\nFirst, looking at the original problem from Stein and Shakarchi. The main task is to prove that the Hardy-Littlewood maximal function f* has a lower bound of c/|x|^d for |x| > 1, given that f is integrable, not identically zero, and has L1 norm 1. Then, conclude that f* isn't integrable. The second part is about showing the weak type estimate is best possible.\n\nSo, the assumptions here need to be broken down. Let's see. The function f is integrable on R^d, which is one assumption. Then, its L1 norm is 1. Also, f is not identically zero. Those are separate conditions on f. Then, the problem has two parts: proving the lower bound and non-integrability, and showing the weak estimate is optimal.\n\nWait, the problem mentions \"if f is integrable... and f is not identically zero\". So the assumptions for the first part are:\n\n1. f is integrable on R^d.\n2. ||f||_L1 = 1.\n3. f is not identically zero.\n\nThen the problem is to prove f*(x) ≥ c/|x|^d for some c>0 and all |x|>1, and conclude f* is not integrable. Then, the second part is a separate problem where f is supported in the unit ball with integral 1, and show the weak estimate m({x: f*(x) > α}) ≥ c'/α for small α.\n\nBut according to the user's example, each assumption should address only one property applied to one object. So, for the first part, the assumptions are:\n\n- f is integrable on ℝ^d,\n- The L1 norm of f is 1,\n- f is not identically zero.\n\nThen, the problem is to prove the lower bound and non-integrability. Then, the second part has additional assumptions: f is supported in the unit ball, ∫|f| =1, and the problem is to show the weak type estimate is best possible.\n\nWait, but the user's example only structured one problem. Here, the original question has two parts. Should each part be structured separately? The user's example shows that even if the original problem has multiple parts, the formatted problem combines them into one. However, in the example, the assumption was split into two lines. But here, the problem has two separate parts. Let me check the user's example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91 for every integer n. The user listed assumptions as n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the user wrote \"for every integer n\", so perhaps there was a misunderstanding. Wait, the original problem in the example says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that might not be correct. Wait, perhaps the example is wrong? Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", which would mean the assumption is just n is an integer. But the formatted problem includes \"n is divisible by 7\", which seems incorrect. Maybe that's a mistake. But regardless, following the user's example, even if the problem is for every integer n, the assumption lists n as integer and n divisible by 7. So perhaps in their example, the problem was misformatted. But since the user provided that example, I need to follow their approach.\n\nIn this current problem, the problem is split into two parts. The first part is to prove the lower bound and non-integrability, under the assumptions that f is integrable, ||f||1=1, and f not identically zero. Then the second part is to show the weak type estimate is best possible under the assumption that f is supported in the unit ball with ∫|f|=1.\n\nBut according to the user's instruction, we need to structure the problem as \"Assumption: ... Problem: ...\". The original question has two separate parts. So perhaps, the first problem is under the first set of assumptions, and the second problem is under the second set. However, the user's example didn't split the problem into parts. So maybe I should structure each part as separate problems? But the user's format example seems to handle a single problem. The original question here has two parts: the main problem and then a \"then show that...\" which is part of the same problem. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe original problem says: \"Prove that if f is integrable... then f*(x) ≥ c/|x|^d ... Conclude that f* is not integrable. Then, show that the weak type estimate...\". So it's a sequence of tasks under the same problem. So perhaps the entire thing is one problem with multiple parts, and the assumptions include the conditions for each part. However, the second part has additional assumptions: f is supported in the unit ball with ∫|f| =1.\n\nSo perhaps the main assumptions for the first part are:\n\n1. f is integrable on ℝ^d,\n2. ||f||_{L^1} = 1,\n3. f is not identically zero.\n\nProblem: Prove that f*(x) ≥ c/|x|^d for some c>0 and all |x|>1, and conclude f* is not integrable.\n\nThen, the second part has assumptions:\n\n1. f is supported in the unit ball,\n2. ∫|f| =1.\n\nProblem: Show that m({x : f*(x) > α}) ≥ c'/α for some c' >0 and all sufficiently small α.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the problem should be structured as a single block. However, the example only had one problem. Here, the original problem has two separate parts with different assumptions. So maybe we need to list all assumptions for all parts, but that may not be correct. Alternatively, split into two problems. However, the user's example didn't split, so maybe we need to include all assumptions in the Assumption section, even if some apply to different parts. Alternatively, the problem is considered as one with multiple parts, so all assumptions are listed together.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the main problem is the first part, and the second part is a follow-up. However, the user's instructions say to filter unrelated information and structure the problem as per the format. So perhaps we need to separate the two parts into two different problems. But the original question is a single post. Hmm.\n\nLooking at the user's example, they took the original problem, which was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but in their formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that might be a mistake. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should just be that n is an integer, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. But in their example, they added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be an error. But regardless, I need to follow the user's example's structure.\n\nIn their example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91\". The formatted problem lists assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But that seems incorrect because the original problem doesn't state that n must be divisible by 7. Wait, unless the user made a mistake in their example. This is confusing. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to structure a problem where the assumptions are split into different lines, even if they are part of the same condition.\n\nBut in the current problem, the first part is under the condition that f is integrable, not identically zero, and ||f||1 =1. The second part adds that f is supported in the unit ball. So perhaps the Assumptions section should list all the assumptions for the entire problem, even if some apply to different parts. But that's not accurate because each part has different assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considered as two separate problems. The first problem is:\n\nAssumption:\n- f is integrable on ℝ^d,\n- ||f||_{L^1} = 1,\n- f is not identically zero.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f*(x) ≥ c/|x|^d for some c >0 and all |x| >1, and conclude that f* is not integrable.\n\nThe second problem:\n\nAssumption:\n- f is supported in the unit ball,\n- ∫|f| =1.\n\nProblem:\nShow that m({x : f*(x) > α}) ≥ c'/α for some c' >0 and all sufficiently small α.\n\nBut the user's example combines multiple parts into one. However, since the original question is a single post, perhaps the answer should structure it as one problem with multiple parts, and list all assumptions. But the second part's assumptions are different. So perhaps the answer should have two separate Assumption and Problem sections. But the user's format example only has one Assumption and one Problem section. Therefore, perhaps the correct way is to list all assumptions related to the entire problem, but since the two parts have different assumptions, it's challenging.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is structured as two separate problems. The original question includes two tasks, so maybe the user wants each task to be structured separately. However, the user's example combines everything into one problem. Given the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to list all the assumptions for the first part and present the first problem, then list the assumptions for the second part and present the second problem, each in their own ### block. But the user's example doesn't do that; it's one block. Therefore, considering the user's instructions and example, perhaps they want a single block with all assumptions listed, even if they pertain to different parts. However, that would mix assumptions for different parts. But in the original problem, the first part's assumptions are f is integrable, ||f||1=1, f not identically zero. The second part's assumptions are f is supported in the unit ball and ∫|f|=1. Therefore, they are separate.\n\nBut the user's example seems to have mistakenly included an extra assumption. So maybe following that example, even if it's not accurate, I should list all the assumptions for all parts. But that would be incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the user's example had a typo, and the correct assumptions should only include what's given in the problem. For example, in the original example problem, the user wrote \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should only be \"n is an integer\", but in their formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\", which is not in the original problem. That seems like a mistake. Therefore, maybe the user intended to list the necessary assumptions for the problem, even if they aren't explicitly stated. For example, in the original example, maybe the divisibility by 7 comes from the fact that 91=13*7, so to prove divisibility by 91, you need n divisible by both, but that's not part of the original problem. So perhaps the user's example is flawed. Given that, maybe I should proceed carefully.\n\nBack to the current problem. The first part says: Prove that if f is integrable on R^d, ||f||1=1, and f not identically zero, then f*(x) ≥ c/|x|^d... So the assumptions for this part are:\n\n1. f is integrable on R^d,\n2. ||f||1 =1,\n3. f is not identically zero.\n\nThen, the problem is to prove the lower bound and non-integrability.\n\nThe second part says: Show that the weak type estimate is best possible, given that f is supported in the unit ball and ∫|f|=1. So assumptions for this part:\n\n1. f is supported in the unit ball,\n2. ∫|f| =1.\n\nProblem: Show that m({x : f*(x) > α}) ≥ c'/α for some c' >0 and all sufficiently small α.\n\nSince these are two separate parts with different assumptions, perhaps they need to be structured as two separate problems. However, the user's example didn't split the problem. But since the original question is one post with two parts, perhaps we need to include both in one problem statement, listing all assumptions together. However, that's not accurate because the second part has different assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considered as a single problem with multiple parts, and the Assumption section includes all assumptions, even if they apply to different parts. But this would be incorrect. Given that, perhaps the correct approach is to structure each part as a separate problem. However, the user's instructions don't mention handling multiple parts. Given the example provided, I think the user expects a single problem block. Therefore, I will have to combine the assumptions, even if they are for different parts. But that's not accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is the first part, and the second part is a follow-up under the same problem. In that case, the assumptions would include all for both parts. But that's not correct either.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is to answer both parts, so the Assumptions include all the different conditions. But since the second part has additional constraints (supported in unit ball), perhaps the Assumptions list all the conditions from both parts. However, that would be:\n\nAssumptions:\n- f is integrable on R^d,\n- ||f||_L1 =1,\n- f is not identically zero,\n- f is supported in the unit ball.\n\nBut in reality, the first part doesn't require f to be supported in the unit ball; that's only for the second part. Therefore, including all would be incorrect.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Given the user's example, perhaps they want the assumptions to be all listed, even if they apply to different parts. However, I think the correct approach is to structure each part as a separate problem. But since the user's example didn't do that, I might need to follow their lead. Alternatively, since the original problem is a single question, perhaps we can structure it as one problem with multiple parts and list all relevant assumptions.\n\nBut considering the user's example had a mistake, I think the safest way is to list the assumptions for each part separately. Therefore, the answer would have two problem blocks. However, since the user's example only has one, maybe they expect one. Given that, perhaps I need to list the assumptions for the first part and then mention the second part's assumptions in the problem statement. But the format requires assumptions to be listed line by line.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considered as one, and the assumptions are:\n\n- f is integrable on R^d,\n- ||f||_{L^1} =1,\n- f is not identically zero,\n- f is supported in the unit ball,\n- ∫|f| =1.\n\nBut this conflates the assumptions of both parts. However, the first part doesn't need f to be supported in the unit ball. Therefore, this is incorrect.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best way is to structure the problem as two separate parts within the same block, each with their own assumptions, but the format doesn't allow that. Therefore, given the user's example, I'll proceed by listing all assumptions for the first part and present the first problem, then include the second part's assumptions in the problem statement. But this may not fit the format.\n\nAlternatively, given that the problem is from Stein and Shakarchi and the user is to format it, perhaps the main problem is the first part, and the second part is a follow-up. The problem statement includes both parts, so the assumptions are those for the first part, and the second part's assumptions are mentioned in the problem. For example:\n\nAssumption:\n- f is integrable on ℝ^d,\n- ||f||_{L^1} =1,\n- f is not identically zero.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f*(x) ≥ c/|x|^d for some c>0 and all |x| >1, conclude f* is not integrable. Then, show that if f is supported in the unit ball with ∫|f| =1, then m({x : f*(x) > α}) ≥ c'/α for some c' >0 and all sufficiently small α.\n\nBut this way, the assumptions for the first part are listed, and the second part's assumptions are in the problem statement. However, the user's example listed assumptions line by line, including for the problem. But in the original example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91, with assumptions being n is integer and n divisible by 7. But the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7, so that might have been an error. Therefore, maybe the user expects that the problem's conditions are split into assumptions, even if they are part of the problem statement.\n\nIn the current problem, the first part is under the condition \"if f is integrable...\", so those are assumptions. The second part says \"if f is supported in the unit ball...\", which are additional assumptions. So perhaps the Assumption section should list all the \"if\" conditions:\n\nAssumption:\n- f is integrable on ℝ^d,\n- ||f||_{L^1} =1,\n- f is not identically zero,\n- f is supported in the unit ball,\n- ∫|f| =1.\n\nBut this combines both parts' assumptions, which isn't accurate because the second part is a separate \"if\". Therefore, this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is structured as two separate problems. The first:\n\nAssumption:\n- f is integrable on ℝ^d,\n- ||f||_{L^1} =1,\n- f is not identically zero.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f^*(x) ≥ c/|x|^d for some c >0 and all |x| >1, and conclude that f^* is not integrable.\n\nThe second:\n\nAssumption:\n- f is supported in the unit ball,\n- ∫|f| =1.\n\nProblem:\nShow that m({x : f^*(x) > α}) ≥ c'/α for some c' >0 and all sufficiently small α.\n\nThis seems correct, but the user's example didn't split the problem. However, given the complexity, I think this is the right approach. However, the user's example might have been wrong, but following instructions, perhaps I should proceed with this structure. However, the original question is one problem with two parts, so maybe the user expects a single block. Given that, perhaps list all assumptions and present both parts in the problem.\n\nBut that would be incorrect because the second part's assumptions are different. Therefore, the accurate way is to split into two problems. However, the user's example didn't do that. Given this confusion, I think the best approach is to list the assumptions for the first part and include the second part's assumptions in the problem statement as per the original problem.\n\nSo, formatted as:\n\nAssumption:\n- f is integrable on ℝ^d,\n- ||f||_{L^1} =1,\n- f is not identically zero.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f^*(x) ≥ c/|x|^d for some c >0 and all |x| >1, conclude that f^* is not integrable. Then, show that if f is supported in the unit ball with ∫|f| =1, then m({x : f^*(x) > α}) ≥ c'/α for some c' >0 and all sufficiently small α.\n\nBut this way, the assumptions are for the first part, and the second part's assumptions are in the problem statement. This might fit the format, even though it's not perfect. However, the user's example includes an assumption that wasn't in the original problem, so perhaps they expect to include all conditions as assumptions, even if they are part of the problem's \"if\" clauses.\n\nAnother approach: the original problem says \"Prove that if f is integrable...\", so the assumptions are the conditions after \"if\". Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- f is integrable on ℝ^d,\n- ||f||_{L^1} =1,\n- f is not identically zero.\n\nThen the problem is to prove the lower bound and non-integrability. The second part says \"show that the weak type estimate... whenever ∫|f| =1, is best possible...\", which introduces new conditions. So the second part's assumptions are:\n\n- f is supported in the unit ball,\n- ∫|f| =1.\n\nBut since the user's format example included the \"if\" conditions as assumptions, perhaps each \"if\" condition is an assumption. Therefore, for the first part, the three assumptions. For the second part, the two new assumptions. Since the problem includes both parts, perhaps the assumptions section should list all five, but that's incorrect because they are separate. Therefore, the accurate answer is to split into two problems. But given the user's example, which didn't split, maybe I should list them all.\n\nBut this is a contradiction. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the following structure, combining both parts into one problem block, listing all assumptions, even though they are for separate parts. But I'll note that this might not be entirely accurate, but per the user's example, this is acceptable.\n\nAssumption:\n- f is integrable on ℝ^d,\n- ||f||_{L^1} =1,\n- f is not identically zero,\n- f is supported in the unit ball.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f^*(x) ≥ c/|x|^d for some c >0 and all |x| >1, conclude that f^* is not integrable. Show that m({x : f^*(x) > α}) ≥ c'/α for some c' >0 and all sufficiently small α.\n\nBut this is incorrect because the second assumption of ∫|f|=1 is already included in the first part, and the support in unit ball is only for the second part. Hence, this approach is flawed.\n\nGiven all this, the best way is to present two separate problem blocks, each with their own assumptions and problem statements. But since the user's example didn't do that, maybe they expect a single block. Therefore, I'll have to compromise and list all assumptions for both parts together, even though they apply to different parts. But I'll make a note.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key assumptions for the entire problem are:\n\n- f is integrable on ℝ^d,\n- ||f||_{L^1} =1,\n- f is not identically zero.\n\nThen, the problem includes two parts, the second of which has an additional condition (supported in unit ball). But in the problem statement, that condition is mentioned as part of the task. So perhaps the assumptions are the first three, and the problem includes the second condition.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\n- f is integrable on ℝ^d,\n- ||f||_{L^1} =1,\n- f is not identically zero.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f^*(x) ≥ c/|x|^d for some c >0 and all |x| >1, conclude that f^* is not integrable. Then, show that if f is supported in the unit ball, then m({x : f^*(x) > α}) ≥ c'/α for some c' >0 and all sufficiently small α.\n\nThis way, the assumptions are for the first part, and the second part's assumption (supported in unit ball) is in the problem statement. This seems reasonable, as the second part is a separate \"show that\" under a different condition. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- f is integrable on ℝ^d,\n- The L¹ norm of f is 1,\n- f is not identically zero.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f*(x) ≥ c/|x|ᵈ for some c > 0 and all |x| > 1, and conclude that f* is not integrable. Then, show that if f is supported in the unit ball with ∫|f| = 1, then m({x : f*(x) > α}) ≥ c'/α for some c' > 0 and all sufficiently small α.\n\nThis way, the first three assumptions are for the first part, and the second part's assumptions (supported in unit ball and ∫|f|=1) are included in the problem statement. Since ∫|f|=1 is already listed in the assumptions, but the second part says \"with ∫|f|=1\", which might be redundant. However, since the problem says \"whenever ∫|f| =1\", maybe it's acceptable.\n\nYes, this seems to fit. The first part assumes ∫|f|=1, and the second part also uses that, but adds the support condition. So the assumptions for the entire problem are the first three, and the second part adds the support condition as part of the problem statement.",
