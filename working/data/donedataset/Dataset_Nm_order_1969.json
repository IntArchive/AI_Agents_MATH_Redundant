    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the user's format. First, I need to read the original question carefully. The user wants to prove that the integral of sin(x) times arctan(1/x) from 0 to infinity equals (π/2)*((e-1)/e). \n\nSo, the problem is about evaluating this specific integral. Now, I need to list all the assumptions. Each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. Let's think: \n\n1. The integral is from 0 to infinity. So, the limits of integration are from 0 to ∞.\n2. The integrand is the product of sin(x) and arctan(1/x). So, two functions multiplied here: sin(x) and arctan(1/x).\n3. The result is supposed to be (π/2)*((e-1)/e). So, the problem is to show that the integral equals this expression.\n\nWait, are there any hidden assumptions here? The functions involved: sin(x) is defined everywhere, arctan(1/x) is defined for x ≠ 0. But since the integral starts at 0, we need to check the behavior as x approaches 0 from the right. However, arctan(1/x) approaches π/2 as x approaches 0, so the integrand is sin(x)*(π/2) near 0, which is integrable. As x approaches infinity, arctan(1/x) behaves like 1/x, so the integrand becomes sin(x)/x, which is conditionally integrable. So perhaps the convergence of the integral is an implicit assumption here.\n\nBut the original problem statement doesn't mention any specific conditions like convergence; it just states the integral equals that value. So maybe the user assumes the integral converges, and the task is to compute it. But according to the example given, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. However, in this integral problem, the original question doesn't state any such conditions. It's just a general integral. So maybe there are no additional assumptions beyond the integral setup. \n\nWait, but in the example, the user restructured the problem by listing assumptions. The original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted version added \"n is divisible by 7\" which was not in the original. Wait, no, the original problem in the example was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem changed the assumption to n being an integer and n divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, in the example, the original problem is \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, the assumptions are \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" That seems like a mistake, because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the divisibility by 7 is not an assumption but part of the problem. Wait, maybe the example is not correctly formatted. Hmm. But according to the user's instruction, the task is to filter the unrelated information and structure the problem with assumptions and problem statement. So maybe in the example, the user made a mistake. Anyway, perhaps the key is to list the assumptions as given in the problem. \n\nBut in the current problem, the integral is presented as given, and the task is to prove it equals that expression. So the assumptions would be the conditions under which the integral holds. But the original problem doesn't specify any particular conditions; it's a definite integral from 0 to infinity. So perhaps the assumptions are just the integral's components. Let me check:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The integral is taken from 0 to ∞.\n- The integrand is the product of sin(x) and arctan(1/x).\n- The integral converges (implicit assumption).\n\nBut the user's example included assumptions that weren't in the original problem (like n divisible by 7). Wait, looking back, the example's original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems contradictory. Maybe there was a mistake in the example. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an extra condition that n is divisible by 7. That changes the problem. So perhaps the example is wrong, but the user wants me to follow the format regardless. \n\nBut in the current problem, the user hasn't mentioned any conditions. So maybe the assumptions are just the integral's structure. Let me proceed.\n\nSo, the problem is to prove that the integral from 0 to infinity of sin(x) arctan(1/x) dx equals (π/2)((e-1)/e). The assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The integral is over the interval [0, ∞).\n- The integrand is the product of sin(x) and arctan(1/x).\n\nBut maybe more precise. For example, arctan(1/x) is defined for x > 0 (since x is in [0, ∞)), so that's an assumption. Also, the integral is an improper integral, so we assume it converges. But the problem statement is to evaluate it, so convergence is part of the problem. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are no additional assumptions beyond what's stated. The user's example included assumptions that were perhaps not in the original problem. Maybe in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Unless the original problem had a typo. But regardless, for the current problem, perhaps the only assumptions are the integral's components. Let me check again the user's instruction: \"filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" So if the original problem has no explicit assumptions beyond the integral setup, then the assumptions would be the components of the integral.\n\nSo, structured as:\n\nAssumption:\n- The integral is computed over the interval from 0 to ∞.\n- The integrand is sin(x) multiplied by arctan(1/x).\nProblem: Prove that the integral equals (π/2)((e-1)/e).\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- The lower limit of integration is 0.\n- The upper limit of integration is ∞.\n- The integrand is sin(x) multiplied by arctan(1/x).\n\nBut perhaps that's splitting hairs. Alternatively, since the integral is from 0 to ∞, that's one assumption. The integrand's form is another. But the example had two assumptions: n is an integer and n divisible by 7, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So maybe the user expects to split the integral's limits and the integrand into separate assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is as stated, and the assumptions are just the integral's structure. So, I think the correct way is:\n\nAssumption:\n- The integral is ∫₀^∞ sin(x) arctan(1/x) dx.\nProblem: Prove that the integral equals (π/2)((e-1)/e).\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption is listed line by line. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- The integral is from 0 to ∞.\n- The integrand is sin(x) multiplied by arctan(1/x).\nProblem: Prove that its value is (π/2)((e-1)/e).\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each assumption is one line, addressing one property. The first line is about the limits, the second about the integrand. The problem is to compute its value.\n\nSo the final answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nThe integral is evaluated over the interval from 0 to ∞,\nThe integrand is the product of $\\sin{x}$ and $\\arctan{\\frac{1}{x}}$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\sin{x}\\arctan{\\frac{1}{x}}\\,\\mathrm{d}x=\\frac{\\pi }{2} \\left(\\frac{e-1}e\\right)$$.\n###",
