    "Content": "Numbers of the form $ \\dfrac{m}{2^{n}} $, where $ m $ is an integer and $ n $ is a non-negative integer, are called dyadic rational numbers . How can one show that the dyadic rationals are dense in $ \\mathbb{R} $?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "So, basically, we have to show that the set of dyadic rationals are dense in $\\mathbb{R}$ . For this, if we show that the set $\\left\\lbrace \\frac{m}{2^n}:m\\in \\mathbb{N}\\cup\\lbrace 0 \\rbrace,n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\text{ and }0\\leq m \\leq 2^n \\right\\rbrace$ is dense in $[0,1]$ , then we are done. From this, one can easily extend $\\textit{denseness}$ of the above numbers from $[0,1]$ into whole $\\mathbb{R}$ . For the above purpose, let $\\epsilon >0$ , and let $x\\in[0,1]$ . From the Archimedean property, there is $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ such that $\\frac{1}{2^n}<\\epsilon$ . Let $m=\\lfloor x\\cdot2^n \\rfloor$ where $\\lfloor\\cdot\\rfloor$ represents Floor function. Then it is clear that $0\\leq m \\leq 2^n$ . From the usual properties of Floor function, we have $$m=\\lfloor x\\cdot2^n \\rfloor \\leq x\\cdot2^n \\leq m+1=\\lfloor x\\cdot2^n \\rfloor+1 $$ , i.e., $$ \\frac{m}{2^n}\\leq x\\leq \\frac{m+1}{2^n} $$ , i.e., $$ 0\\leq x-\\frac{m}{2^n}\\leq \\frac{1}{2^n} <\\epsilon $$ which is exactly the statement we want to prove. Thus the set $\\left\\lbrace \\frac{m}{2^n}:m\\in \\mathbb{N}\\cup\\lbrace 0 \\rbrace,n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\text{ and }0\\leq m \\leq 2^n \\right\\rbrace$ is dense in $[0,1]$ . Now just extend this to whole $\\mathbb{R}$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to format this problem according to the given example. Let me start by reading the original question carefully. The user wants to show that dyadic rationals are dense in ℝ. Dyadic rationals are numbers of the form m/2ⁿ where m is an integer and n is a non-negative integer. \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The example had two assumptions: one about n being an integer and another about divisibility. Here, the problem is about dyadic rationals. The key components are the definition of dyadic rationals and the space they're dense in, which is ℝ.\n\nSo, the dyadic rationals are defined by two conditions: m is an integer, and n is a non-negative integer. Each assumption should address one property of one object. So, m is an integer—that's one assumption. Then n is a non-negative integer—that's another. The problem statement is to show that these numbers are dense in ℝ. \n\nWait, but in the example, they included an assumption that n is divisible by 7. However, in this problem, the original question doesn't have any additional constraints beyond the definition. The user is asking to prove density based solely on the definition of dyadic rationals. So, the assumptions here are the definitions of m and n. \n\nTherefore, the assumptions should be:\n- m is an integer.\n- n is a non-negative integer.\n\nThe problem is to show that the set of such numbers is dense in ℝ. So, the problem statement is: Show that the dyadic rationals are dense in ℝ.\n\nI should check if there's any other implicit assumptions. For example, does the problem assume knowledge of the real numbers or density? Well, the question is about proving density, so the main assumptions are the definitions of the dyadic rationals. The rest is part of the problem to be proven. \n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nm is an integer,\nn is a non-negative integer.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the dyadic rationals are dense in ℝ.\n\nYes, that seems right. The example didn't include the definition of density as an assumption, just the conditions on the objects involved. So here, the objects are m and n with their respective conditions. The problem is about density in ℝ, which is the main task. I think that's correctly formatted according to the example provided.",
