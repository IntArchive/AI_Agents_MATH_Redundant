    "Content": "Let $X$ be a nonempty set. A collection $S$ of subsets of $X$ is \n  called a semiring if it satisfies the following properties: The empty set belongs to S; that is $\\emptyset \\in S$. If $A,B \\in S$; then $A \\cap B \\in S$; that is, $S$ is closed under finite intersections. The set difference of any two sets of $S$ can be written as a finite union of \n  pair-wise disjoint members of $S$. That is, for every $A, B \\in S$; there exist\n  $C_1, ...,C_n \\in S$ (depending on $A$ and $B$) such that $A\\setminus B = \\cup _{i=1}^n C_i$ and $C_i \\cap C_j = \\emptyset$ if $i\\ne j$. Now, let $S$ be a semiring of subsets of $X$. A subset $A$ of $X$ is called a $\\sigma$-set with respect to $S$ (or simply a $\\sigma$-set) if there exists a disjoint sequence $\\{A_n\\}$ of \n$S$ such that $A = \\cup_{n=1}^\\infty A_n$. One can show easily that for every sequence $\\{A_n\\}$ of $S$, the set $A = \\cup_{n=1}^\\infty A_n$ is a $\\sigma$-set. I would like to prove that finite intersections of $\\sigma$-sets is a $\\sigma$-set. For this purpose, suppose $A ,B$ are $\\sigma$-sets then $A = \\cup_{i=1}^\\infty C_i$ , $B = \\cup_{j=1}^\\infty D_j$. $$A\\cap B=(\\cup_{i=1}^\\infty C_i)\\cap (\\cup_{j=1}^\\infty D_j)$$ In this step I don't know am I allowed to use distributive law for infinitely many sets? Or the law holds only for finitely many sets? If it holds only for finitely many sets how do I prove that finite intersections of $\\sigma$-sets is a $\\sigma$-set? Thanks.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Yes, both distributive laws generalize. (You need only one of the two, but it’s useful to know both.) The first step in verifying the generalization that you want is to check that $$\\left(\\bigcup_{i\\in I}A_i\\right)\\cap D=\\bigcup_{i\\in I}(A_i\\cap D)\\;,\\tag{1}$$ and to verify its mate you’ll want to check that $$\\left(\\bigcap_{i\\in I}A_i\\right)\\cup D=\\bigcap_{i\\in I}(A_i\\cup D)\\;.\\tag{2}$$ Both are easily verified by element-chasing. For $(1)$, if $x\\in\\left(\\bigcup_{i\\in I}A_k\\right)\\cap D$, then $x\\in\\bigcup_{i\\in I}A_i$ and $x\\in D$. Since $x\\in\\bigcup_{i\\in I}A_i$, there is an $i_0\\in I$ such that $x\\in A_{i_0}$, and therefore $x\\in A_{i_0}\\cap D\\subseteq\\bigcup_{i\\in I}(A_i\\cap D)$. Conversely, if $x\\in\\bigcup_{i\\in I}(A_i\\cap D)$, then there is an $i_0\\in I$ such that $x\\in A_{i_0}\\cap D$. Then $x\\in A_{i_0}\\subseteq\\bigcup_{i\\in I}A_i$, and $x\\in D$, so $x\\in\\left(\\bigcup_{i\\in I}A_i\\right)\\cap D$. For $(2)$, if $x\\in\\left(\\bigcap_{i\\in I}A_i\\right)\\cup D$, then $x\\in\\bigcap_{i\\in I}A_i$ or $x\\in D$. Let $i_0\\in I$ be arbitrary. Then $A_{i_0}\\supseteq\\bigcap_{i\\in I}A_i$, so $x\\in A_{i_0}$ or $x\\in D$, and therefoer $x\\in A_{i_0}\\cup D$. Since this holds for each $i_0\\in I$, $x\\in\\bigcap_{i\\in I}(A_i\\cup D)$. Conversely, if $x\\in\\bigcap_{i\\in I}(A_i\\cup D)$, then $x\\in A_i\\cup D$ for each $i\\in I$. If $x\\in D$, then certainly $x\\in\\left(\\bigcap_{i\\in I}A_i\\right)\\cup D$. If $x\\notin D$, then we must have $x\\in A_i$ for each $i\\in I$, in which case $x\\in\\bigcap_{i\\in I}A_i\\subseteq\\left(\\bigcap_{i\\in I}A_i\\right)\\cup D$. Two applications of $(1)$ will give you the distributive law that you want. Suppose that $C=\\bigcup_{i\\in I}A_i$ and $D=\\bigcup_{j\\in J}B_j$. Then $$\\begin{align*}\nC\\cap D&=\\left(\\bigcup_{i\\in I}A_i\\right)\\cap D\\\\\n&=\\bigcup_{i\\in I}(A_i\\cap D)\\\\\n&=\\bigcup_{i\\in I}\\left(A_i\\cap\\bigcup_{j\\in J}B_j\\right)\\\\\n&=\\bigcup_{i\\in I}\\left(\\bigcup_{j\\in J}(A_i\\cap B_j)\\right)\\\\\n&=\\bigcup_{\\langle i,j\\rangle\\in I\\times J}(A_i\\cap B_j)\\;.\n\\end{align*}$$ In other words, $C\\cap D$ is the union of all possible intersections of the form $A_i\\cap B_j$. In particular, if $I$ and $J$ are countable index sets, $I\\times J$ is also countable. Similarly, two applications of $(2)$ will give you the other general distributive law of this kind. This time suppose that $C=\\bigcap_{i\\in I}A_i$ and $D=\\bigcap_{j\\in J}B_j$. Then $$\\begin{align*}\nC\\cup D&=\\left(\\bigcap_{i\\in I}A_i\\right)\\cup D\\\\\n&=\\bigcap_{i\\in I}(A_i\\cup D)\\\\\n&=\\bigcap_{i\\in I}\\left(A_i\\cup\\bigcap_{j\\in J}B_j\\right)\\\\\n&=\\bigcap_{i\\in I}\\left(\\bigcap_{j\\in J}(A_i\\cup B_j)\\right)\\\\\n&=\\bigcap_{\\langle i,j\\rangle\\in I\\times J}(A_i\\cup B_j)\\;\n\\end{align*}$$ the intersection of all possible unions of the form $A_i\\cup B_j$ as $i$ and $j$ run over their respective index sets.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let's start by reading the original question carefully.\n\nThe user is asking whether the distributive law applies to infinitely many sets when dealing with σ-sets, which are countable unions of disjoint sets from a semiring S. They want to prove that the finite intersection of σ-sets is also a σ-set. \n\nFirst, I need to list all assumptions. The problem mentions a semiring S of subsets of a nonempty set X. The properties of a semiring are given: empty set is in S, closed under finite intersections, and set differences can be written as finite unions of disjoint sets from S. Then, a σ-set is defined as a set that can be expressed as a countable union of disjoint sets from S. The user is trying to show that the intersection of two σ-sets (A and B) is also a σ-set. They expressed A and B as unions of disjoint sequences {C_i} and {D_j}, respectively. Then, they wrote the intersection as the union over i and j of C_i intersect D_j. The question is whether this distributive law (intersection distributes over union) holds for infinite cases, which would allow them to proceed. If not, how else can they approach the proof?\n\nNow, for the assumptions: Each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. Let's break down the given information.\n\n1. X is a nonempty set.\n2. S is a semiring of subsets of X.\n3. S contains the empty set.\n4. S is closed under finite intersections: If A, B ∈ S, then A ∩ B ∈ S.\n5. For any A, B ∈ S, A \\ B is a finite union of pairwise disjoint sets from S.\n6. A σ-set is a subset of X that is a countable union of disjoint sets from S.\n7. The user is considering two σ-sets A and B.\n8. A is expressed as ∪_{i=1}^∞ C_i where {C_i} are disjoint and in S.\n9. Similarly, B is ∪_{j=1}^∞ D_j with {D_j} disjoint and in S.\n10. The problem is to prove that A ∩ B is a σ-set.\n\nWait, the original problem mentions finite intersections of σ-sets being σ-sets. The user is starting with two σ-sets and their intersection. So the specific problem here is to show that the intersection of two σ-sets is a σ-set, which would generalize to finite intersections by induction.\n\nNow, the assumptions need to be listed line by line. Let me check each point:\n\n- X is nonempty: yes, that's given.\n- S is a semiring: yes, with the three properties. However, the three properties of a semiring need to be broken down into separate assumptions. But in the example provided, the assumptions were listed as separate lines. So, the semiring's properties should each be separate assumptions.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, the semiring's properties are part of the problem setup. So, each property of the semiring S should be an assumption.\n\nBut the problem is about σ-sets and their intersections. So the key assumptions are:\n\n1. X is a nonempty set.\n2. S is a semiring of subsets of X.\n3. S contains the empty set.\n4. S is closed under finite intersections.\n5. For any A, B ∈ S, A \\ B is a finite union of pairwise disjoint sets from S.\n6. A σ-set is a subset of X that is a countable union of pairwise disjoint sets from S.\n7. A and B are σ-sets.\n8. A = ∪_{i=1}^∞ C_i where each C_i ∈ S and the C_i are pairwise disjoint.\n9. B = ∪_{j=1}^∞ D_j where each D_j ∈ S and the D_j are pairwise disjoint.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that the intersection of two σ-sets (A and B) is a σ-set. The user is questioning whether the distributive law (intersection over union) applies to infinite unions, which would allow them to write A ∩ B as ∪_{i,j} (C_i ∩ D_j). However, they are unsure if this step is valid because the distributive law for infinite sets might not hold, or if it's only for finite cases.\n\nSo the problem is: Given the above assumptions, prove that the intersection of two σ-sets is a σ-set. The user's specific question is about the applicability of the distributive law in this context.\n\nNow, structuring the problem according to the format:\n\nAssumptions should list all necessary conditions. Let me list them:\n\n- X is a nonempty set.\n- S is a semiring of subsets of X.\n- ∅ ∈ S.\n- For all A, B ∈ S, A ∩ B ∈ S.\n- For all A, B ∈ S, there exist pairwise disjoint C₁, …, Cₙ ∈ S such that A \\ B = ∪_{i=1}^n C_i.\n- A σ-set is a countable union of pairwise disjoint sets from S.\n- A and B are σ-sets.\n- A = ∪_{i=1}^∞ C_i with C_i ∈ S pairwise disjoint.\n- B = ∪_{j=1}^∞ D_j with D_j ∈ S pairwise disjoint.\n\nBut perhaps some of these can be combined. Wait, the definition of a semiring includes the three properties. So the first five assumptions are about S being a semiring. Then the σ-set definitions.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were listed as separate lines for each condition, even if they pertained to the same object. For example, in the example, the first assumption was \"n is an integer\", the second \"n is divisible by 7\". So each condition on the same object is a separate line.\n\nTherefore, for the semiring S:\n\n1. X is a nonempty set.\n2. S is a collection of subsets of X.\n3. ∅ ∈ S.\n4. For all A, B ∈ S, A ∩ B ∈ S.\n5. For all A, B ∈ S, there exist pairwise disjoint C₁, …, Cₙ ∈ S such that A \\ B = ∪_{i=1}^n C_i.\n\nThen, the σ-set definitions:\n\n6. A subset A of X is a σ-set if there exists a disjoint sequence {A_n} in S such that A = ∪_{n=1}^∞ A_n.\n7. A is a σ-set.\n8. B is a σ-set.\n9. A = ∪_{i=1}^∞ C_i where {C_i} is a disjoint sequence in S.\n10. B = ∪_{j=1}^∞ D_j where {D_j} is a disjoint sequence in S.\n\nBut the problem is to show that A ∩ B is a σ-set.\n\nHowever, maybe some of these can be simplified. For instance, 7 and 8 are covered by 6, given that A and B are σ-sets. But in the example, they listed specific conditions on n. So here, since A and B are given as σ-sets, we need to state that.\n\nBut perhaps the assumptions can be:\n\n- X is a nonempty set.\n- S is a semiring of subsets of X.\n- For all A, B ∈ S, A ∩ B ∈ S.\n- For all A, B ∈ S, A \\ B is a finite union of pairwise disjoint sets from S.\n- A is a σ-set with respect to S.\n- B is a σ-set with respect to S.\n- A = ∪_{i=1}^∞ C_i where each C_i ∈ S and the C_i are pairwise disjoint.\n- B = ∪_{j=1}^∞ D_j where each D_j ∈ S and the D_j are pairwise disjoint.\n\nBut maybe the problem doesn't need to restate all the semiring properties but rather refer to S being a semiring. However, the example given in the user's instruction included specific assumptions like \"n is an integer\", \"n is divisible by 7\". So perhaps each property of the semiring should be listed as separate assumptions, even if they are part of the definition.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". The user had to specify the conditions on n. Similarly, here, the semiring's properties are part of the problem's setup, so they should be listed as assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. X is a nonempty set.\n2. S is a collection of subsets of X.\n3. ∅ ∈ S.\n4. For any A, B ∈ S, A ∩ B ∈ S.\n5. For any A, B ∈ S, A \\ B is a finite union of pairwise disjoint sets from S.\n6. A is a σ-set with respect to S.\n7. B is a σ-set with respect to S.\n8. A = ∪_{i=1}^∞ C_i with {C_i} ⊆ S pairwise disjoint.\n9. B = ∪_{j=1}^∞ D_j with {D_j} ⊆ S pairwise disjoint.\n\nThe problem is to prove that A ∩ B is a σ-set.\n\nBut the user's main question is about the distributive law: can they write A ∩ B as ∪_{i,j} (C_i ∩ D_j), and is this a valid step for infinite unions? The problem is structured to ask whether this is permissible and, if not, how else to approach the proof.\n\nHowever, according to the user's instruction, the \"Problem\" part should be the problem statement as given. The user's original problem is: \"Prove that finite intersections of σ-sets is a σ-set.\" But in their specific case, they're considering two σ-sets A and B and trying to show A ∩ B is a σ-set, which would be the base case for finite intersections.\n\nSo the formatted problem should capture the user's intent to prove that the intersection of two σ-sets is a σ-set, with the specific question about the distributive law's applicability.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a nonempty set,\nS is a semiring of subsets of X,\n∅ ∈ S,\nFor all A, B ∈ S, A ∩ B ∈ S,\nFor all A, B ∈ S, A \\ B is a finite union of pairwise disjoint sets from S,\nA is a σ-set with respect to S,\nB is a σ-set with respect to S,\nA = ∪_{i=1}^∞ C_i where {C_i} are pairwise disjoint sets in S,\nB = ∪_{j=1}^∞ D_j where {D_j} are pairwise disjoint sets in S.\n\nProblem:\nProve that A ∩ B is a σ-set with respect to S.\n\nWait, but the user's actual problem statement is: \"I would like to prove that finite intersections of σ-sets is a σ-set.\" So perhaps the problem should state \"Prove that the finite intersection of σ-sets is a σ-set.\" But in the example provided, the problem was more specific (about A(n) being divisible by 91). Here, the user is trying to prove a general statement for finite intersections, but in the example, they start with two σ-sets. So maybe the formatted problem is to prove that the intersection of two σ-sets is a σ-set, which would be the base case for finite intersections.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be \"Prove that the finite intersection of σ-sets is a σ-set,\" but the user's specific step is about two sets. Given the example, perhaps the formatted problem should capture the specific case the user is working on, which is the intersection of two σ-sets.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a nonempty set,\nS is a semiring of subsets of X,\n∅ is an element of S,\nFor all A, B in S, A ∩ B is in S,\nFor all A, B in S, A \\ B is a finite union of pairwise disjoint sets in S,\nA is a σ-set with respect to S,\nB is a σ-set with respect to S,\nA is the union of a disjoint sequence {C_i} in S,\nB is the union of a disjoint sequence {D_j} in S.\n\nProblem:\nProve that A ∩ B is a σ-set with respect to S.\n\nBut I need to ensure each assumption is a single line, each addressing one property. Let me adjust:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a nonempty set,\nS is a collection of subsets of X,\nThe empty set ∅ is an element of S,\nFor all A, B ∈ S, A ∩ B ∈ S,\nFor all A, B ∈ S, there exists a finite collection of pairwise disjoint sets {C₁, C₂, ..., Cₙ} ⊆ S such that A \\ B = ∪ₖ Cₖ,\nA is a σ-set with respect to S,\nB is a σ-set with respect to S,\nA = ∪_{i=1}^∞ C_i where each C_i ∈ S and C_i ∩ C_j = ∅ for i ≠ j,\nB = ∪_{j=1}^∞ D_j where each D_j ∈ S and D_j ∩ D_k = ∅ for j ≠ k.\n\nProblem:\nProve that A ∩ B is a σ-set with respect to S.\n\nYes, this seems to cover all necessary assumptions. Each line addresses a single property or condition on one object. The problem is to prove the intersection is a σ-set.",
