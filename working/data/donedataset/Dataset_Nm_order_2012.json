    "Content": "I have to prove that any number of the form $3n+2$ has a prime factor of the form $3m+2$. Ive started the proof I tried saying by the division algorithm the prime factor is either the form 3m,3m+1,3m+2. Case 1: $3m$\n     suppose $3m$ does divide $3n+2$. That means $3mr=3n+2$ where $r$ is some integer. But we get $mr-n= 2/3$ and since $mr-n$ is an integer that's a contradiction. Thus $3m$ does not work. Case 2: $3m+1$\nSame argument here Case 3: $3m+2$\nBy the fundamental theorem of arithmetic every integer is divisible by a prime. But not sure what to do from here.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Hint $ $ If $\\,N = 3n+2\\,$ has no prime factors of form $\\,3k+2,\\,$ then all prime factors must have form $\\,3k+1,\\,$ hence their product $\\,N\\,$ has form $\\,3k+1,\\,$ contra $\\,N = 3n+2.$ Generally any factorization of an integer $\\not\\equiv 1\\!\\pmod{\\!m}\\,$ must include a factor $\\not\\equiv 1\\!\\pmod{\\!m}\\,$ simply because integers $ \\equiv 1\\!\\pmod{\\!m}\\,$ are closed under multiplication (form a monoid ).  Similarly for other sets of integers closed under multiplication. Consider the set T of integers divisible by $10,\\,$ i.e. those with unit digit $= 0.\\,$ Any factorization of an integer $\\,n\\not\\in T\\,$ must include a factor $\\not\\in T,\\,$ else all factors have unit digit $= 0\\,$ thus so too does their product $\\,n,\\,$ i.e. $\\,n\\in T,\\,$ contra hypothesis. Similarly, one could let $\\,T\\,$ be all powers of $\\,10,\\,$ etc. This property of factors of elements in the complement of $T$ is just an equivalent complementary restatement of the closure of $T$ under multiplication.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about proving that any number of the form 3n+2 has a prime factor of the form 3m+2. The user tried using the division algorithm and considered three cases for the prime factors: 3m, 3m+1, and 3m+2. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The problem states that the number is of the form 3n+2. So the main assumption is that there's a number k = 3n + 2, where n is an integer. Then, the goal is to show that at least one prime factor of k is congruent to 2 mod 3 (i.e., 3m + 2). \n\nThe user's approach was to consider possible forms of prime factors. The division algorithm tells us that any integer is either 3m, 3m+1, or 3m+2. They correctly eliminated 3m as a possible factor because if a prime were 3m, it would have to be 3 itself (since primes greater than 3 can't be multiples of 3). Then, they showed that 3 divides 3n+2 only if 3 divides 2, which it doesn't, so primes of the form 3m can't divide 3n+2. \n\nNext, they considered primes of the form 3m+1. The user didn't fully explain this case but probably intended to argue that if all prime factors were of the form 3m+1, then their product would also be 1 mod 3, which contradicts the original number being 2 mod 3. However, the user might be stuck on how to formalize this step. \n\nSo the key assumptions here are:\n1. The number in question is of the form 3n + 2, where n is an integer.\n2. Prime factors are either of the form 3m, 3m+1, or 3m+2.\n3. A prime factor of the form 3m implies the prime is 3, which cannot divide 3n+2 (as shown in the contradiction).\n4. If all prime factors were of the form 3m+1, then their product would be congruent to 1 mod 3, conflicting with the original number being 2 mod 3.\n\nBut according to the format, each assumption should address only one property applied to one object. Let me break this down:\n\nAssumptions:\n- k is a number such that k = 3n + 2 for some integer n.\n- Any prime divisor of k must be of the form 3m, 3m + 1, or 3m + 2 where m is an integer.\n- A prime of the form 3m is equal to 3.\n- If a prime divides k, then it cannot be of the form 3m (since 3 does not divide k).\n- If all prime divisors of k are of the form 3m + 1, then k ≡ 1 mod 3.\n- The original number k ≡ 2 mod 3.\n\nWait, but some of these are derived from the problem's conditions. The problem's explicit assumption is that the number is 3n+2. The rest might be part of the reasoning steps. However, the example given in the original instruction includes an assumption about n being an integer and n being divisible by 7. So maybe the assumptions here are only the given conditions, not the derived steps.\n\nLooking back at the example: the original problem had an expression A(n) defined, and the assumption was that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. The problem then was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nIn the current problem, the main assumption is that the number is of the form 3n+2, i.e., k = 3n + 2. The problem is to prove that such a number has a prime factor of the form 3m + 2. \n\nSo the assumptions should list the given conditions. The user hasn't stated any other constraints, like n being positive or something else. So the main assumption is that k is of the form 3n + 2 where n is an integer.\n\nBut in their attempt, they also assume that primes can be written as 3m, 3m+1, or 3m+2. However, that's a general fact from number theory, not a specific assumption of the problem. So perhaps the only explicit assumption is that k = 3n + 2 for some integer n.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included both that n is an integer and that it's divisible by 7. Here, the problem is to prove for any number of the form 3n+2. So the assumption is that the number is 3n+2 where n is an integer. \n\nSo, structuring the problem:\n\nAssumption: The number k is of the form 3n + 2 where n is an integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that k has a prime factor of the form 3m + 2.\n\nBut in the original problem statement, the user starts by saying \"any number of the form 3n+2 has a prime factor of the form 3m+2\". So the key assumption is that k = 3n + 2. But perhaps the problem is more general, not assuming anything else. Therefore, the formatted problem should have the assumption that k is of the form 3n + 2 (with n integer), and the problem is to show that such a k has a prime factor of the form 3m + 2.\n\nHowever, in the example, assumptions included both the variable being an integer and any specific conditions. Here, the problem states \"any number of the form 3n+2\", so the only assumption is that k is such a number, i.e., k = 3n + 2 for some integer n. There's no additional condition like divisibility unless specified. \n\nBut the user's original attempt considered cases for the prime factors. Maybe there's an implicit assumption that primes can only be of the forms 3m, 3m+1, or 3m+2. But that's a general fact from modular arithmetic, not specific to the problem. So perhaps the only explicit assumption here is that k is 3n + 2. \n\nHowever, in the example, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\", which was part of the problem's original statement. So comparing to that, the problem here is \"any number of the form 3n+2\" which translates to k = 3n + 2 where n is an integer. Therefore, the formatted problem's assumption should be \"k is a number such that k = 3n + 2 for some integer n\".\n\nBut the user's problem didn't specify k, they just said \"any number of the form 3n+2\". So maybe in the formatted problem, the assumption is \"The number is of the form 3n + 2 where n is an integer\".\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\nAssumption:\n- The number is of the form 3n + 2 where n is an integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the number has a prime factor of the form 3m + 2.\n\nBut in the example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the assumptions were that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So here, similarly, the assumption is that the number is 3n+2 (with n integer). The problem is to prove the existence of a prime factor of a specific form.\n\nBut perhaps the assumptions need to list all the necessary starting points. However, in the original problem statement, the user is told to filter unrelated information and structure the problem. The user in their question starts by considering prime factors as 3m, 3m+1, or 3m+2. But that's part of their approach, not an assumption of the problem. Therefore, the only assumption from the problem is the number's form.\n\nSo the correct formatting should be:\n\nAssumption: \n- The number is of the form $3n + 2$ where $n$ is an integer.\n\nProblem: \nProve that the number has a prime factor of the form $3m + 2$.\n\nBut let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem had the expression A(n) and the assumptions were that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. The formatted problem's assumptions list these two. However, in the problem here, the only assumption is that the number is of the form 3n+2, with n integer. So the formatted problem should have that as the assumption.\n\nWait, but the original problem didn't explicitly state \"n is an integer\", but since it's talking about numbers of the form 3n+2, n must be an integer. So that's an implicit assumption.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n- $n$ is an integer,\n- The number is $3n + 2$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the number has a prime factor of the form $3m + 2$.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about any integer of the form 3n+2, so the assumption is that the number is 3n+2 where n is an integer. So each assumption line addresses one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- The number is expressed as $3n + 2$,\n- $n$ is an integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the number has a prime factor of the form $3m + 2$.\n\nBut maybe even more precise. Since the problem is about \"any number of the form 3n+2\", which implies that n is an integer, so:\n\nAssumption:\n- $k$ is a number such that $k = 3n + 2$ for some integer $n$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $k$ has a prime factor of the form $3m + 2$.\n\nAlternatively, if we follow the example's structure where they list \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions, here we can list:\n\nAssumption:\n- $k$ is of the form $3n + 2$,\n- $n$ is an integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $k$ has a prime factor of the form $3m + 2$.\n\nBut the original problem didn't mention k, so maybe the problem is directly about numbers of the form 3n+2. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\n- The number is $3n + 2$,\n- $n$ is an integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the number has a prime factor of the form $3m + 2$.\n\nYes, this seems to align with the example where they had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, the two assumptions would be that the number is 3n+2 and that n is an integer.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nThe number is $3n + 2$,\n$n$ is an integer.\nProblem: \nProve that the number has a prime factor of the form $3m + 2$.\n###",
