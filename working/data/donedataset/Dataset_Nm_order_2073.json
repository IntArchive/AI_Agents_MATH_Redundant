    "Content": "My teacher taught me this fast method to determine the equation of the tangent line to a conic section. In the Netherlands this is called \"eerlijk delen\" or literally translated into English \"fair division\". Here is an example of how it works: Find the equation of the tangent line to the circle $x^2+y^2+6x-8=0$ in $A(1,-1)$. The equation of the tangent line is $x\\cdot x_A+y\\cdot y_a+3x+3x_A-8=0 \\implies x-y+3x+3-8=0 \\implies 4x-y-5=0$. This same method works with all conic sections, but it still remains a bit vague to me why this works. Has someone seen this method previously, is it used often, and could someone provide a proof for this?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Suppose the original conic section is $$Ax^2+Bxy+Cy^2+Dx+Ey+F=0$$ The tangent line at $(x_0,y_0)$ is $$y-y_0=m(x-x_0)$$ To find $m$, take derivative on both sides of the conic section: $$2Ax+By+Bx\\frac{dy}{dx}++2Cy\\frac{dy}{dx}+D+E\\frac{dy}{dx}=0$$\nSolve for $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ and plug into $m$: $$y-y_0=\\frac{-2Ax_0-By_0-D}{Bx_0+2Cy_0+E}(x-x_0)$$ Simplify: $$(2Ax_0+By_0+D)x+(Bx_0+2Cy_0+E)y-(2Ax_0^2-2Bx_0y_0-2Cy_0^2-Dx_0-Ey_0)=0$$ Use the fact that $Ax_0^2 +Bx_0y_0 +Cy_0^2+Dx_0+Ey_0+F=0$ since $(x_0,y_0)$ is a point on the conic section, we can simplify the equation further into: $$(2Ax_0+By_0+D)x+(Bx_0+2Cy_0+E)y+Dx_0+Ey_0+2F=0\\Rightarrow\\\\\n(Ax_0+\\frac{1}{2}By_0+\\frac{1}{2}D)x+(\\frac{1}{2}Bx_0+Cy_0+\\frac{1}{2}E)y+\\frac{1}{2}Dx_0+\\frac{1}{2}Ey_0+F=0$$ In your case, $B=E=0$: $$(Ax_0+\\frac{1}{2}D)x+(Cy_0)y+\\frac{1}{2}Dx_0+F=0$$ that is $$x\\cdot x_0+y\\cdot y_0+3x+3x_0-8=0$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to figure out why this \"fair division\" method works for finding the tangent line to a conic section at a given point. Let's start by understanding the example provided. The circle equation is x² + y² + 6x - 8 = 0, and the point of tangency is A(1, -1). The method replaces x² with x*x_A, y² with y*y_A, and similarly handles the linear terms by splitting them into x + x_A. Then, substituting the point into this new equation gives the tangent line. \n\nFirst, I should recall the standard method for finding the tangent to a conic. For a circle (x-h)² + (y-k)² = r², the tangent at (x₁, y₁) is (x₁ - h)(x - h) + (y₁ - k)(y - k) = r². But in the given example, the circle isn't centered at the origin. Let me rewrite the given circle equation in standard form. x² + 6x + y² = 8. Completing the square for x: (x² + 6x + 9) + y² = 8 + 9, so (x + 3)² + y² = 17. The center is (-3, 0) and radius √17. Then the tangent at (1, -1) should be (1 + 3)(x + 3) + (-1 - 0)(y - 0) = 17. Simplifying: 4(x + 3) - 1*y = 17 → 4x + 12 - y = 17 → 4x - y - 5 = 0. Which matches the result from the method. So in this case, the \"fair division\" method gives the same result as the standard tangent formula for circles.\n\nBut the user mentions this works for all conic sections. Let me think about other conics like ellipses, hyperbolas, parabolas. For example, the general equation of a conic is Ax² + Bxy + Cy² + Dx + Ey + F = 0. The tangent line at a point (x₁, y₁) on the conic can be found by replacing x² with x*x₁, xy with (x*y₁ + y*x₁)/2, y² with y*y₁, x with (x + x₁)/2, y with (y + y₁)/2. Wait, this is similar to the method described. Maybe the \"fair division\" is a way of remembering this substitution. For the circle example, there's no xy term, so it's replacing x² with x*x_A, y² with y*y_A, and the linear term 6x is split as 3x + 3x_A. Then substituting x_A and y_A gives the tangent line equation. \n\nTo prove this works in general, we need to show that this substitution method gives the equation of the tangent line for any conic. The key idea is that the tangent line at a point on a conic can be found by taking the equation of the conic and replacing quadratic terms with terms involving the coordinates of the point. For example, x² becomes x*x₁, y² becomes y*y₁, xy becomes (x*y₁ + y*x₁)/2, and linear terms are averaged: x becomes (x + x₁)/2, y becomes (y + y₁)/2. But in the given example, the linear term 6x is split as 3x + 3x_A. That seems like instead of replacing x with (x + x₁)/2, they're writing 6x as 3x + 3x₁. So 6x becomes 3x + 3x_A, which is equivalent to 6*(x + x_A)/2. So in general, for a linear term Dx, you replace it with D*(x + x₁)/2, which is D/2 x + D/2 x₁. Similarly for Ey. \n\nThus, the \"fair division\" method is a mnemonic for this substitution. For each term in the conic equation:\n\n- x² → x*x₁\n- y² → y*y₁\n- xy → (x*y₁ + y*x₁)/2\n- x → (x + x₁)/2\n- y → (y + y₁)/2\n- constant term remains the same.\n\nBut in the example given, the linear term 6x is split into 3x + 3x_A, which is equivalent to 6*(x + x_A)/2. Similarly, if there's a term like Ey, it would become E/2 y + E/2 y_A. Then, substituting (x₁, y₁) into this equation gives the tangent line. Let me verify that with the circle example.\n\nOriginal equation: x² + y² + 6x - 8 = 0.\n\nUsing substitution:\n\nx² → x*1\n\ny² → y*(-1)\n\n6x → 3x + 3*1\n\n-8 remains.\n\nSo the tangent equation is x*1 + y*(-1) + 3x + 3*1 - 8 = 0 ⇒ x - y + 3x + 3 -8 = 0 ⇒ 4x - y -5 =0, which is correct. \n\nTo prove this works generally, consider the general conic equation Ax² + Bxy + Cy² + Dx + Ey + F = 0. The tangent line at (x₁, y₁) on the conic is given by:\n\nA x₁ x + B (x₁ y + y₁ x)/2 + C y₁ y + D (x + x₁)/2 + E (y + y₁)/2 + F = 0.\n\nThis is derived using calculus (taking the derivative and finding the tangent line) or using the fact that the tangent line at a point on the conic has this equation, which can be shown via homogenization or duality in projective geometry. Alternatively, using the gradient for the conic as the normal vector, the tangent line equation can be written as ∇f · (X - P) = 0, where f is the conic equation evaluated at point P. However, expanding that should lead to the same substitution method.\n\nLet me verify this with another example. Take an ellipse, say x²/4 + y²/9 = 1. The tangent at (2, 0) should be x = 2. Using the substitution method:\n\nOriginal equation: x²/4 + y²/9 -1 =0.\n\nApplying substitution:\n\n(x*2)/4 + (y*0)/9 -1 =0 ⇒ (2x)/4 +0 -1=0 ⇒ x/2 -1=0 ⇒ x=2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: Hyperbola x² - y² =1 at (cosh t, sinh t). The tangent should be x cosh t - y sinh t =1. Let's apply the substitution:\n\nOriginal equation: x² - y² -1=0.\n\nSubstitute: x*cosh t - y*sinh t -1=0, which matches the standard tangent equation.\n\nThus, the method works because it's a way of writing the tangent line equation for any conic by replacing the quadratic terms with the products of the coordinates and the point of tangency, and adjusting the linear terms appropriately. This is equivalent to using the gradient (partial derivatives) to find the tangent line, which is why it's valid for all conic sections.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are that the point lies on the conic and the conic is given by a general quadratic equation. The problem is to prove that substituting x² → x x₁, y² → y y₁, xy → (x y₁ + y x₁)/2, and linear terms as averages gives the tangent line equation.",
