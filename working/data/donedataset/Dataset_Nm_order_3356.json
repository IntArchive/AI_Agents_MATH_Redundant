    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants me to prove that the limit of tan(x)/x as x approaches 0 is 1 without using L'Hospital's rule. Hmm, I remember that the standard proof involves using the squeeze theorem with sine and cosine.\n\nFirst, I should recall the basic trigonometric limits: lim_{x→0} sin(x)/x = 1 and lim_{x→0} (1 - cos(x))/x = 0. Maybe I can express tan(x) as sin(x)/cos(x) and then split the limit into two parts. Let's see, tan(x)/x = (sin(x)/x) * (1/cos(x)). Since the limit of sin(x)/x is 1 and the limit of 1/cos(x) as x approaches 0 is 1 (because cos(0) is 1), multiplying these two limits would give 1*1 = 1. That seems straightforward.\n\nWait, but is that rigorous enough? The user might want a more detailed approach, maybe using the squeeze theorem directly on tan(x)/x. Alternatively, using Taylor series expansion, but that could be considered similar to L'Hospital's if they're both relying on derivatives. The problem specifies not to use L'Hospital's, so Taylor series might be acceptable if the user hasn't learned that yet.\n\nAnother approach could be using the geometric interpretation of tangent. If I consider the unit circle, the area of the sector corresponding to angle x is (1/2)x. Comparing that to the areas of the triangles formed by sin(x) and tan(x), maybe I can set up inequalities. For small x, sin(x) ≤ x ≤ tan(x). Dividing all parts by x, we get sin(x)/x ≤ 1 ≤ tan(x)/x. Taking reciprocals might complicate things, but perhaps rearranging the inequalities. Wait, if x ≤ tan(x), then dividing both sides by x gives 1 ≤ tan(x)/x. But we also know that sin(x)/x approaches 1. Then, combining these, tan(x)/x is squeezed between 1 and something that also approaches 1. Hmm, not sure if that's directly applicable. Maybe I need to manipulate the inequalities differently.\n\nAlternatively, using the expansion of tan(x) around 0. The Taylor series of tan(x) is x + x^3/3 + 2x^5/15 + ..., so tan(x)/x would be 1 + x^2/3 + ... which clearly approaches 1 as x→0. But again, if Taylor series is off-limits because it's similar to L'Hospital's, then this method isn't suitable.\n\nBack to the original idea: expressing tan(x)/x as [sin(x)/x] * [1/cos(x)]. Both factors have limits that are 1, so the product should be 1. This relies on the limit law that the limit of a product is the product of the limits, provided both limits exist. Since sin(x)/x approaches 1 and 1/cos(x) approaches 1, their product approaches 1. This seems valid. But perhaps the problem expects a more foundational proof, starting from the definition or using the squeeze theorem directly on tan(x)/x without decomposing it.\n\nAlternatively, using the substitution h = x, so as h approaches 0, we can write the limit as [tan(h)]/h. Then, express tan(h) as sin(h)/cos(h), leading again to [sin(h)/h] * [1/cos(h)]. The same reasoning applies. Maybe to make it more detailed, one can use the epsilon-delta definition. Given that sin(h)/h approaches 1, for any epsilon > 0, there exists delta1 such that if |h| < delta1, |sin(h)/h - 1| < epsilon/2. Similarly, since cos(h) approaches 1, there exists delta2 such that if |h| < delta2, |1/cos(h) - 1| < epsilon/2. Taking delta as the minimum of delta1 and delta2, then combining the two inequalities using the product. But maybe that's overcomplicating.\n\nI think the standard approach is sufficient. The key is recognizing tan(x) as sin(x)/cos(x) and then using the known limits of sin(x)/x and cos(x). Since the problem restricts the use of L'Hospital's rule, but using basic trigonometric limits and limit properties is acceptable. Therefore, the proof should be straightforward by splitting into those two parts.",
