    "Content": "Consider a sequence of random variable $(X_n)$. Prove the following inequality:\n  $$\n\\mathbb P\\left(\\liminf\\{X_n \\leq x\\}\\right) \\leq \\liminf\\mathbb P\\left(\\{X_n \\leq x\\}\\right)\\leq \\limsup\\mathbb P\\left(\\{X_n \\leq x\\}\\right) \\leq \\mathbb P\\left(\\limsup\\{X_n \\leq x\\}\\right).\n$$ I can see that the second $\\leq$ is simply the result for real sequence.

    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $A_n = \\{X_n \\le x\\}$ . Then $$\\liminf A_n = \\bigcup_{n \\ge 1} \\bigcap_{k\\ge n} A_k$$ Since $\\{\\cap_{k\\ge n} A_k\\}_{n = 1}^\\infty$ is a sequence which increases to $\\liminf A_n$ , $$P(\\liminf A_n) = \\lim_{n\\to \\infty} P\\left(\\bigcap_{k \\ge n} A_k\\right)\\tag{1}$$ by continuity of $P$ from below. Since $\\cap_{k\\ge n} A_k \\subseteq A_n$ for all $n$ , $P(\\cap_{k\\ge n} A_k) \\le P(A_n)$ for all $n$ . Hence $$\\liminf_{n\\to \\infty} P\\left(\\bigcap_{k \\ge n} A_k\\right) \\le \\liminf_{n\\to \\infty} P(A_n)\\tag{2}$$ By $(1)$ and $(2)$ , $$P(\\liminf_{n\\to \\infty} A_n) \\le \\liminf_{n\\to \\infty} P(A_n).$$ For the last equality, let $\\Omega$ be the underlying sample space. Apply the lim inf inequality to the sequence $B_n = \\Omega \\setminus A_n$ to get $P(\\limsup A_n) \\ge \\limsup P(A_n)$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me start by reading the original question carefully. The user is asking about proving an inequality involving liminf and limsup in probability for a sequence of random variables (X_n). The specific inequality is:\n\nP(lim inf {X_n ≤ x}) ≤ lim inf P(X_n ≤ x) ≤ lim sup P(X_n ≤ x) ≤ P(lim sup {X_n ≤ x})\n\nThe user mentions that the middle inequality is straightforward from real sequences but is stuck on the first and last inequalities. They also note that the first and last might be similar.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem is about a sequence of random variables (X_n). The key assumptions here are:\n\n1. (X_n) is a sequence of random variables. Each X_n is a random variable, so each is a measurable function from a probability space to the real numbers.\n2. The events considered are {X_n ≤ x} for each n and some fixed x. The probability of these events is taken, and then liminf and limsup are applied to both the probabilities and the events themselves.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, are there any specific conditions on x or the random variables? The original problem doesn't mention any restrictions on x, like it being a real number or something else. However, since {X_n ≤ x} is an event, x must be a real number. So maybe an assumption is that x is a real number. But the user didn't specify that, but in probability, when we write X_n ≤ x, x is typically a real number. So perhaps that's an implicit assumption.\n\nAlso, the problem is to prove the inequality chain. The assumptions would include that (X_n) is a sequence of random variables defined on some probability space, and x is a real number. But the user didn't specify any particular conditions like independence or identical distribution, so those aren't assumptions here.\n\nLooking at the example provided earlier, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, no, looking back, the original problem was: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\" Then in the formatted problem, the assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, that seems like a mistake because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so n is an integer, but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", which was not in the original. Hmm, maybe the example was incorrect. But perhaps the user intended to filter unrelated information. Wait, maybe the original problem had a mistake, and the formatted corrected it? Wait, perhaps in the example, the user made an error. Anyway, I need to focus on the current problem.\n\nSo, in the current problem, the user is talking about a sequence of random variables (X_n). The problem is to prove the inequality involving probabilities of liminf and limsup of the events {X_n ≤ x}. So the assumptions would be:\n\n1. Let (X_n) be a sequence of random variables.\n2. Let x be a real number.\n3. For each n, {X_n ≤ x} is an event in the probability space.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is general, so maybe the key assumption is just the existence of such a sequence. However, in the problem statement, the user didn't specify any particular conditions beyond the sequence being random variables. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- (X_n) is a sequence of random variables defined on a probability space.\n- x is a real number.\n\nBut the problem as stated in the user's question doesn't have additional conditions. So when structuring the problem, the assumptions should include:\n\nAssumption:\n$(X_n)$ is a sequence of random variables,\n$x$ is a real number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that\n$$\n\\mathbb P\\left(\\liminf\\{X_n \\leq x\\}\\right) \\leq \\liminf\\mathbb P\\left(\\{X_n \\leq x\\}\\right)\\leq \\limsup\\mathbb P\\left(\\{X_n \\leq x\\}\\right) \\leq \\mathbb P\\left(\\limsup\\{X_n \\leq x\\}\\right).\n$$\n\nBut wait, the user mentions that the first and last inequalities are the ones they need help with. However, in the problem statement, all three inequalities are presented as part of the problem to prove. The example given in the original had a situation where some assumptions were perhaps added, but in this case, there's no missing assumption. The problem is to prove the entire inequality chain for any sequence of random variables and real x.\n\nBut according to the example, the user might have included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Maybe the example was wrong, but perhaps the user made a mistake. Anyway, I need to focus on the current problem.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are that (X_n) is a sequence of random variables and x is a real number. The problem is to prove the inequality chain. So structuring it as per the format:\n\nAssumption:\n$(X_n)$ is a sequence of random variables,\n$x$ is a real number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that\n$$\n\\mathbb P\\left(\\liminf\\{X_n \\leq x\\}\\right) \\leq \\liminf\\mathbb P\\left(\\{X_n \\leq x\\}\\right)\\leq \\limsup\\mathbb P\\left(\\{X_n \\leq x\\}\\right) \\leq \\mathbb P\\left(\\limsup\\{X_n \\leq x\\}\\right).\n$$\n\nBut wait, in the original problem, the user wrote:\n\n\"Prove the following inequality:\n$$\n\\mathbb P\\left(\\liminf\\{X_n \\leq x\\}\\right) \\leq \\liminf\\mathbb P\\left(\\{X_n \\leq x\\}\\right)\\leq \\limsup\\mathbb P\\left(\\{X_n \\leq x\\}\\right) \\leq \\mathbb P\\left(\\limsup\\{X_n \\leq x\\}\\right).\n$$\"\n\nSo the problem is exactly as stated. The assumptions are the existence of the sequence (X_n) and x being real. Therefore, the formatted problem should list those two assumptions and present the problem as is.",
