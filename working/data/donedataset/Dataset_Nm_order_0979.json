    "Content": "I have verified analytically the conjecture described bellow up to $n=4$, but have had no success trying to prove it. Any help would be much appreciated. Setup Let $\\{\\lambda_i\\}_{i=1}^n$ be real numbers and $g_i:\\mathbb R \\to \\mathbb R$ for all $i\\in \\mathbb N $. Consider the following recurrence $$ g_{i+1}(x)=\\frac{1+g_{i}(\\lambda_{i})g_{i}(x)}{g_{i}(\\lambda_{i})-g_{i}(x)}\\frac{x-\\lambda_{i}}{1-\\lambda_{i}x}. $$ with $$ g_1(x) = a+bx .$$ Next, let $$ \\mathbf M_i(x) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{x-\\lambda_i}{1-\\lambda_i x}\\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix} g_i(\\lambda_i) & -1 \\\\ 1 & g_i(\\lambda_i)\\end{bmatrix}, $$ and $$ S(x) = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix} g_{n+1}(0) & -1 \\\\ 1 & g_{n+1}(0)\\end{bmatrix}\\left[\\mathbf M_n(x)\\mathbf M_{n-1}(x)\\dots\\mathbf M_{2}(x)\\mathbf M_1(x)\\right]\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1\\end{bmatrix}.$$ Conjecture For all $n\\ge 2$ and for all $i,j\\in\\{1,\\dots,n\\}$, $$\\frac{S(\\lambda_i)}{S(\\lambda_j)} = \\frac{\\lambda_j\\left(1+g_1(\\lambda_j)g_1(1/\\lambda_j)\\right)}{\\lambda_i\\left(1+g_1(\\lambda_i)g_1(1/\\lambda_i)\\right)}.$$ The reason I consider this surprising is that the analytical formulas for $S(x)$ become extremely complicated very quickly as $n$ increases, yet these ratios continue to satisfy this simple equation. Background The motivation for this question comes from the following. Suppose $\\mathbf A (x)$ is a $2\\times 2$ matrix such that $\\det (\\mathbf A (x))$ has $n+1$ roots (inside the unit circle): $\\{\\lambda_i\\}_{i=1}^n$ and $0$. To solve some forecasting problems (in which $\\mathbf A (x)$ represents the signal structure) it is useful to find a matrix $\\mathbf B (x)$ such that $\\det(\\mathbf A (x)\\mathbf B (x))$ has no roots (inside the unit circle). A procedure to obtain the matrix $\\mathbf B (x)$ is as follows. To remove the first root, $\\lambda_1$, you multiply $\\mathbf A (x)$ by an unitary matrix times the Blaschke matrix for this root, i.e. $$ \\mathbf A^* (x) = \\mathbf A (x) \\mathbf W_1 \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{x-\\lambda_1}{1-\\lambda_1 x}\\end{bmatrix}$$ where $\\mathbf W_1$ is a matrix whose columns are the left singular vectors of the of $\\mathbf A(\\lambda_1)$. To remove the second root, $\\lambda_2$, you repeat this step using $\\mathbf A^*(x)$ instead of $\\mathbf A(x)$. Then, one can simply repeat this step for each of the other roots. The matrices $\\mathbf M_i(x)$ above are (up to a constant), the transpose of the matrices that are multiplied to $\\mathbf A^*(x)$ in each step described above. One simplifying aspect of the problem I am working with is that the second row of $\\mathbf A(x)$ is equal to $0$ when evaluated at any of the roots.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Upon setting $\\lambda_{n+1}=0$, we see that\n$$S(x) = \\frac{1}{x}\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\\left[\\mathbf M_{n+1}(x)\\mathbf M_n(x)\\mathbf M_{n-1}(x)\\dots\\mathbf M_{2}(x)\\mathbf M_1(x)\\right]\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1\\end{bmatrix}.$$ Thus (working with $n$ instead of $n+1$), we see that we have to control the lower right entry of $$\\mathbf M(x)=\\mathbf M_n(x)\\mathbf M_{n-1}(x)\\dots\\mathbf M_{2}(x)\\mathbf M_1(x).$$ By induction, one verifies that $g_i(\\lambda_i)-g_i(x)$ is a scalar multiple (factor depending on $i$) of $\\frac{x-\\lambda_i}{1-x\\lambda_{i-1}}$ for $i\\ge 2$. Set $$\\Gamma(x)=\\prod_{i=1}^n\\frac{x-\\lambda_i}{1-x\\lambda_i}\\text{ and }g(x)=\\prod_{i=1}^n(g_i(\\lambda_i)-g_i(x)).$$ Thus\n$$\ng(x)=c\\Gamma(x)(1-x\\lambda_n)\\tag{1}\n$$\nfor a constant $c$. In the following, we drop the argument $x$ if the meaning is clear. From the recursion for $g_i$ we obtain\n$$\\mathbf M_i\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ g_i\\end{bmatrix}=(g_i(\\lambda_i)-g_i(x))\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ g_{i+1}\\end{bmatrix}.$$ Iterated application yields $$\\mathbf M\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ g_1\\end{bmatrix}=g\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ g_{n+1}\\end{bmatrix}.\\tag{2}$$ For a term $A$ in $x$ define $\\tilde A$ by $\\tilde A(x)=A(1/x)$. Then\n$$\\tilde{\\mathbf M}_i^t\\mathbf M_i=(g_i(\\lambda_i)^2+1)\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1\\end{bmatrix},$$ hence $$\\tilde{\\mathbf M}^t\\mathbf M=\\gamma\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1\\end{bmatrix},$$ where $$\\gamma=\\prod_{i=1}^n(g_i(\\lambda_i)^2+1).$$ Now we apply the tilde transformation to equation (2):\n$$\\tilde{\\mathbf M}\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tilde g_1\\end{bmatrix}=\\tilde g\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tilde g_{n+1}\\end{bmatrix}.$$ Transposing and multiplying from the right with $M$ yields\n$$\\gamma\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & \\tilde g_1 \\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & \\tilde g_1 \\end{bmatrix}\\tilde{\\mathbf M}^t\\mathbf M=\\tilde g\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & \\tilde g_{n+1} \\end{bmatrix}\\mathbf M.$$ Together with the previous relation (2) for $\\mathbf M$ we obtain four linear equations for the four entries of $\\mathbf M=\\begin{bmatrix} m_1 & m_2\\\\ m_3 & m_4 \\end{bmatrix}$ in terms of $\\gamma,g_1,\\tilde g_1,g_{n+1},\\tilde g_{n+1},g,\\tilde g$, namely\n\\begin{align*}\nm_1+m_2g_1&=g\\\\\nm_3+m_4g_1&=gg_{n+1}\\\\\nm_1\\tilde g+m_3\\tilde g_{n+1}\\tilde gt&=\\gamma\\\\\nm_2\\tilde g+m_4\\tilde g_{n+1}\\tilde g&=\\tilde g_1\\gamma.\n\\end{align*}\nThe rank of the system is $3$. Use the first, second and fourth equation to express $m_1,m_2,m_3$ in terms of $m_4$. As expected, the third equation does not allow to solve for $m_4$, rather it collapses to\n$$(g_{n+1}\\tilde g_{n+1} + 1)g\\tilde g=(g_1\\tilde g_1+1)\\gamma,\\tag{3}$$\na relation we will need in a moment. We can determine $m_4$ from\n$$m_1m_4-m_2m_3=\\det\\mathbf M=\\gamma\\Gamma(x)$$ and obtain\n$$\nm_4(x)=\\frac{(g\\tilde g_1g_{n+1} + \\tilde g\\Gamma)\\gamma}{(g_{n+1}\\tilde g_{n+1} + 1)g\\tilde g}.$$ Together with (3) this gives\n$$m_4(x)=\\frac{g\\tilde g_1g_{n+1} + \\tilde g\\Gamma}{g_1\\tilde g_1 + 1}.$$ For $1\\le i\\le n-1$ we have $g(\\lambda_i)=0$, and $\\lambda_i$ is not a pole of $\\tilde g_1$, nor of $g_{n+1}$. However, $\\lambda_i$ is a root of $\\Gamma$, and potentially a pole of $\\tilde g$. So in order to evaluate $\\tilde g\\Gamma$ in $\\lambda_i$ we apply the tilde operation to equation (1) and obtain $$\\tilde g=c\\tilde\\Gamma\\left(1-\\frac{\\lambda_n}{x}\\right).$$ It follows from the definition of $\\Gamma$ that $\\tilde\\Gamma\\Gamma=1$, hence $$\\tilde g\\Gamma=c\\frac{x-\\lambda_n}{x}.$$ Now we can evaluate in $\\lambda_i$ and $\\lambda_j$, and obtain\n$$\n\\frac{m_4(\\lambda_i)}{m_4(\\lambda_j)}\n=\\frac{\\lambda_j\\;(g_1(\\lambda_j)g_1(1/\\lambda_j) + 1)\\;(\\lambda_n - \\lambda_i)}{\\lambda_i\\;(g_1(\\lambda_i)g_1(1/\\lambda_i) + 1)\\;(\\lambda_n - \\lambda_j)}.$$\nThus, as explained in the beginning, with $\\lambda_n=0$ we get the case $n-1$ of the question.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let me try to parse this problem and format it according to the user's instructions. First, I need to identify all the assumptions and then state the problem clearly.\n\nStarting with the original question: The user has a conjecture about the ratio S(λ_i)/S(λ_j) being equal to a specific expression involving λ_i, λ_j, and g1 evaluated at those points. They also mention verifying this up to n=4 but needing a proof. The setup includes recurrence relations for g_i, definitions of matrices M_i(x), and the construction of S(x). There's also some background about Blaschke matrices and removing roots inside the unit circle, but that might be more context than necessary for the problem statement.\n\nFirst, list all assumptions. The problem mentions several conditions:\n\n1. Let {λ_i}_{i=1}^n be real numbers. So, each λ_i is real.\n2. For all i in N, g_i: R → R. Each function g_i maps reals to reals.\n3. The recurrence relation for g_{i+1}(x) is given in terms of g_i(x) and λ_i. This recurrence applies for each i.\n4. The initial function g_1(x) is a linear function: a + bx. Here, a and b might be constants, but since they aren't specified further, they are parameters. Wait, the problem statement doesn't specify if a and b are given constants or variables. The conjecture is for all n ≥ 2 and for all i,j, so perhaps a and b are part of the setup but not variables? The problem doesn't state any restrictions on a and b, so maybe they are arbitrary, but in the conjecture, the ratio involves g1(λ_i) and g1(1/λ_i), which would depend on a and b. So perhaps a and b are fixed constants? Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify, so maybe the conjecture holds for any a and b. However, the problem statement says \"Setup Let...\", so the user defines g1(x) = a + bx. Since they aren't quantified, maybe they are part of the given conditions. So, the assumptions would include that g1 is defined as a linear function with coefficients a and b. Wait, but in the problem statement, the conjecture is about the ratio S(λ_i)/S(λ_j) in terms of g1 evaluated at λ_i and 1/λ_i. So perhaps the user is assuming that a and b are such that g1 is defined as a + bx, but no further conditions. So I need to list that as an assumption.\n\nLet me try to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition for one object.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n1. For each i ∈ {1, ..., n}, λ_i is a real number.\n2. For each i ∈ N, the function g_i: R → R is real-valued.\n3. The recurrence relation for g_{i+1}(x) is defined as: g_{i+1}(x) = [1 + g_i(λ_i) g_i(x)] / [g_i(λ_i) - g_i(x)] * (x - λ_i)/(1 - λ_i x) for each i ∈ N.\n4. The initial function is g_1(x) = a + b x, where a and b are constants.\n5. For each i ∈ {1, ..., n}, the matrix M_i(x) is defined as the product of two matrices: [[1,0],[0, (x - λ_i)/(1 - λ_i x)]] multiplied by [[g_i(λ_i), -1], [1, g_i(λ_i)]].\n6. The function S(x) is defined as [0 1] * [[g_{n+1}(0), -1], [1, g_{n+1}(0)]] * M_n(x) M_{n-1}(x) ... M_1(x) * [0; 1].\n7. The conjecture holds for all integers n ≥ 2.\n8. For all i, j ∈ {1, ..., n}, the ratio S(λ_i)/S(λ_j) is conjectured to equal [λ_j (1 + g1(λ_j) g1(1/λ_j))] / [λ_i (1 + g1(λ_i) g1(1/λ_i))].\n\nWait, but the conjecture itself is the problem, so the problem is to prove that for all n ≥ 2 and for all i,j in 1,...,n, the ratio S(λ_i)/S(λ_j) equals that expression.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are the setup conditions leading up to the conjecture. So, the problem is the conjecture statement, and the assumptions are the definitions and conditions given in the setup.\n\nLooking back at the example provided, in the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. But in the original problem, the user didn't mention n divisible by 7. Wait, no—the example was the formatted version, where they possibly filtered out some conditions. Wait, in the original example, the problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. But that seems incorrect unless the original problem had that assumption. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the example? Wait, let's check.\n\nOriginal example: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\" Then formatted problem says assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should not include that n is divisible by 7. So perhaps the example is incorrect? Or maybe the user had a different original problem. Wait, maybe the original problem had an additional condition, but in the example presented, they included an assumption that n is divisible by 7. So perhaps the user made an error in the example. But regardless, the task is to structure the given problem according to the example.\n\nBut in the current problem, the setup is given, and the conjecture is the problem to prove. So the assumptions are the given conditions, and the problem is the conjecture.\n\nTherefore, in the current problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- Each λ_i is a real number.\n- Each g_i is a function from R to R.\n- The recurrence relation for g_{i+1}(x) as given.\n- The initial function g_1(x) = a + bx.\n- The definition of matrices M_i(x).\n- The definition of S(x) as the product of matrices multiplied by the vectors.\n\nBut the conjecture is for all n ≥ 2 and for all i,j, the ratio S(λ_i)/S(λ_j) equals the given expression.\n\nSo each assumption should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition for one object.\n\nLet me parse the original question again.\n\nOriginal setup:\n\n- Let {λ_i}_{i=1}^n be real numbers.\n\n- g_i: R → R for all i ∈ N.\n\n- Recurrence: g_{i+1}(x) = [1 + g_i(λ_i) g_i(x)] / [g_i(λ_i) - g_i(x)] * (x - λ_i)/(1 - λ_i x).\n\n- g_1(x) = a + bx.\n\nMatrices:\n\n- M_i(x) = [[1,0],[0, (x - λ_i)/(1 - λ_i x)]] * [[g_i(λ_i), -1], [1, g_i(λ_i)]].\n\n- S(x) = [0 1] * [[g_{n+1}(0), -1], [1, g_{n+1}(0)]] * M_n(x)...M_1(x) * [0;1].\n\nConjecture: For all n ≥ 2 and for all i,j ∈ {1,...,n}, S(λ_i)/S(λ_j) = [λ_j (1 + g1(λ_j) g1(1/λ_j))]/[λ_i (1 + g1(λ_i) g1(1/λ_i))].\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n1. For each i ∈ {1, ..., n}, λ_i is a real number.\n\n2. For each i ∈ N, the function g_i: R → R.\n\n3. For each i ∈ N, g_{i+1}(x) is defined by the recurrence relation: [1 + g_i(λ_i)g_i(x)]/[g_i(λ_i) - g_i(x)] * (x - λ_i)/(1 - λ_i x).\n\n4. The function g_1(x) is defined as a + bx, where a and b are constants.\n\n5. For each i ∈ {1, ..., n}, the matrix M_i(x) is the product of diag(1, (x - λ_i)/(1 - λ_i x)) and the matrix [[g_i(λ_i), -1], [1, g_i(λ_i)]].\n\n6. The function S(x) is defined by the product of matrices M_n(x)...M_1(x) sandwiched between the row vector [0, 1], the matrix [[g_{n+1}(0), -1], [1, g_{n+1}(0)]], and the column vector [0; 1].\n\n7. The integer n is greater than or equal to 2.\n\nBut wait, the conjecture is \"for all n ≥ 2\", so n ≥ 2 is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. The assumptions are the conditions given in the setup. The problem is to prove the conjecture for all n ≥ 2 and all i,j.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should include the definitions and initial conditions, while the problem includes the universal quantifiers (for all n ≥ 2, etc.).\n\nSo the problem statement is: Prove that for all n ≥ 2 and for all i,j ∈ {1,...,n}, the ratio S(λ_i)/S(λ_j) equals [λ_j (1 + g1(λ_j)g1(1/λ_j))]/[λ_i (1 + g1(λ_i)g1(1/λ_i))].\n\nNow, each assumption:\n\n1. Each λ_i is a real number (for i from 1 to n).\n\n2. For each i ∈ N, g_i is a function from R to R.\n\n3. The recurrence relation for g_{i+1}(x) as given.\n\n4. The initial function g_1(x) = a + bx.\n\n5. Each matrix M_i(x) is defined as the product of the diagonal matrix and the [[g_i(λ_i), -1], [1, g_i(λ_i)]] matrix.\n\n6. S(x) is defined via the matrix product involving M_i(x) matrices and the specified vectors.\n\nNow, each of these should be listed line by line. Let's check:\n\n- \"For each i ∈ {1, ..., n}, λ_i is a real number.\" That's one assumption.\n\n- \"For each i ∈ N, g_i: R → R is a real-valued function.\" Another assumption.\n\n- \"For each i ∈ N, the function g_{i+1}(x) is defined by $$g_{i+1}(x) = \\frac{1 + g_i(\\lambda_i)g_i(x)}{g_i(\\lambda_i) - g_i(x)} \\cdot \\frac{x - \\lambda_i}{1 - \\lambda_i x}$$.\" Third assumption.\n\n- \"The initial function is g_1(x) = a + bx, where a and b are constants.\" Fourth.\n\n- \"For each i ∈ {1, ..., n}, the matrix M_i(x) is defined as $$\\mathbf M_i(x) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{x-\\lambda_i}{1-\\lambda_i x}\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} g_i(\\lambda_i) & -1 \\\\ 1 & g_i(\\lambda_i)\\end{bmatrix}$$.\" Fifth.\n\n- \"The function S(x) is defined as $$S(x) = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} g_{n+1}(0) & -1 \\\\ 1 & g_{n+1}(0)\\end{bmatrix} \\left[\\mathbf M_n(x)\\mathbf M_{n-1}(x)\\dots\\mathbf M_{1}(x)\\right] \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1\\end{bmatrix}$$.\" Sixth.\n\nThat's six assumptions. The problem is then the conjecture statement, which is for all n ≥ 2 and i,j in {1,...,n}, the ratio S(λ_i)/S(λ_j) equals the given expression.\n\nNow, check if there are any other assumptions. The problem mentions that \"the analytical formulas for S(x) become extremely complicated...\", but that's just context. The background about Blaschke matrices is also context, not part of the problem's assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list these six assumptions and then state the problem as proving the conjecture.",
