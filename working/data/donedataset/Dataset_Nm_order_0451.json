    "Content": "It seems evident from infinitely many primitive pythagorean triples $(a,b,c)$ that there are infinitely many rational points $\\left(\\frac{a}{c}, \\frac{b}{c}\\right)$ on the unit circle. But how would one go about, and show that they are dense, in the sense that for two rational points $x$ and $y$ of angles $α$ and $β$ on the unit circle, if $α<β$ there is a third rational point $z$ of angle $γ$ on the unit circle, such that $α<γ$ and $γ<β$. Is it to expect that this conjecture holds and that it isn't an unsolved number theory problem?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Consider a nonvertical line through the point $(1, 0)$ of slope $m$. This line meets the circle at exactly one other point, and it's not hard to show that the coordinates of that point are $$P_m=\\left({m^2-1\\over m^2+1}, {-2m\\over m^2+1}\\right).$$ As long as $m$ is rational, $P_m$ has rational coordinates; so now think about the lines through $(1, 0)$ of rational slope . . .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about whether the rational points on a unit circle are dense. The user mentions primitive Pythagorean triples generating infinitely many rational points and wants to show density in a specific sense related to angles between points.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states there are infinitely many rational points from Pythagorean triples. The key conditions here are about the density: for any two rational points x and y with angles α and β where α < β, there exists another rational point z with angle γ between them. The user is also asking if this is a known result or an unsolved problem.\n\nSo, the assumptions should list each condition separately. The main objects here are the rational points on the unit circle, the angles α and β, and the existence of a third point z. Each assumption should address one property. Let me break it down:\n\n1. The unit circle has infinitely many rational points from primitive Pythagorean triples.\n2. For any two rational points x and y with angles α and β where α < β.\n3. There exists a rational point z with angle γ such that α < γ < β.\n\nThe problem is to prove that such a point z exists, making the rational points dense on the unit circle. Also, the user questions if this is an established result or still unsolved.\n\nI need to ensure each assumption is a single condition applied to one object. Let me check the example again. The example listed each condition on separate lines, like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So here, similarly, each aspect of the problem's conditions should be listed as separate assumptions.\n\nWait, the original problem doesn't explicitly state that α and β are angles of rational points, but that's implied by x and y being rational points. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The unit circle contains infinitely many rational points (from Pythagorean triples).\n- For two rational points x and y on the unit circle with angles α and β respectively, where α < β.\n- The density requires a third rational point z with angle γ between α and β.\n\nBut the problem is to show that such a z exists, hence proving density. The user also asks if this is a known result or an open problem. However, the format requires stating the problem as a directive, like \"Prove that...\" or \"Show that...\", but the original question is phrased as asking how to show it and whether it's unsolved.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem statement here is: \"Show that the rational points on the unit circle are dense, such that for any two rational points x and y with angles α < β, there exists a rational point z with angle γ satisfying α < γ < β. Determine if this conjecture is proven or an unsolved problem in number theory.\"\n\nBut the example given in the format simplified the problem statement. Let me look back. The example took the original problem, filtered out the extra info like \"it seems evident...\" and structured the problem concisely. So here, the problem part should be the main question: Are the rational points on the unit circle dense? Or more precisely, as the user wrote, \"how would one go about and show that they are dense...\" with the specific angle condition.\n\nBut the example's problem part was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" So maybe here the problem is \"Prove that the rational points on the unit circle are dense,\" with the angle condition as part of the problem statement. However, the user's specific density condition is in terms of angles between any two points. So perhaps the problem statement should include that angle condition.\n\nThe original question has two parts: 1) showing density in the specific angle sense, and 2) asking if this is an unsolved problem. But the format seems to require structuring the problem as a single statement to prove. So maybe the problem is \"Prove that the rational points on the unit circle are dense, such that for any two rational points x and y with angles α < β, there exists a rational point z with angle γ where α < γ < β,\" and the assumptions include the existence of infinitely many points via Pythagorean triples.\n\nBut the problem as posed by the user is a question about how to show this density and whether it's a known result. However, the example given converted the original problem into a \"Prove that...\" statement. So perhaps the formatted problem here would be similar: \"Prove that the rational points on the unit circle are dense...\" even though the user is asking how to do it and if it's solved.\n\nBut the task is to structure the problem as per the format, which includes listing assumptions and the problem statement. The user's original question is more of a query, but the example took the original problem's content and structured it into a clear problem statement. So in this case, the problem would be \"Show that the rational points on the unit circle are dense, in the sense that for any two rational points x and y with angles α < β, there exists a third rational point z with angle γ such that α < γ < β. Determine whether this conjecture holds and if it is an unsolved problem in number theory.\"\n\nBut wait, the example only included the problem statement, not the meta-question about whether it's solved. The example's problem was \"Prove that A(n)... is divisible by 91.\" The user here is also asking if it's an unsolved problem. However, the format might require focusing only on the mathematical problem, not the meta-question. Maybe the problem part is just the density part, and the question about it being unsolved is additional context.\n\nBut according to the instructions, the task is to filter unrelated information and structure the problem. The user's problem is to show density in the angle sense and determine if it's an unsolved problem. However, the example included only the mathematical problem. Maybe the problem statement should be the mathematical part, and the other part is part of the original question but not the structured problem.\n\nBut in the example, the original problem had \"Prove that for every integer n...\", and the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. The original problem here is \"Are the rationals on a unit circle dense?\" with additional context. So perhaps the structured problem is the main question, and the assumptions include the existence of infinitely many points via Pythagorean triples, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- There are infinitely many rational points on the unit circle from primitive Pythagorean triples.\n- Two rational points x and y on the unit circle have angles α and β with α < β.\n- The unit circle's rational points are considered dense if between any two such points, there's another rational point.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that the rational points on the unit circle are dense under this angle condition.\n\nBut I need to make sure each assumption is a single condition applied to one object. Let's try:\n\nAssumption:\n- There exist infinitely many rational points on the unit circle derived from primitive Pythagorean triples.\n- For any two rational points x and y on the unit circle, their angles α and β satisfy α < β.\n- Density on the unit circle requires a rational point z with angle γ such that α < γ < β.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the rational points on the unit circle are dense, i.e., for any two rational points x and y with angles α < β, there exists a rational point z with angle γ between α and β. Determine if this conjecture is proven or remains unsolved in number theory.\n\nBut the example didn't include the \"determine if...\" part. The original example's problem was just the mathematical statement. So perhaps the problem is only the mathematical part, and the query about being unsolved is additional context not included in the formatted problem. However, the user's question includes both parts. The instructions say to \"structure that problem as the following format\" with assumptions and problem. The example included assumptions and the problem to prove. Here, the problem is two-fold: proving density and determining its status. But maybe the format expects only the mathematical problem. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem listed assumptions and the problem. The user's additional text (\"how would one go about...\") was filtered out. So here, the formatted problem should capture the core mathematical question, which is proving the density. The part about \"is it to expect that this conjecture holds...\" is additional and might be considered not part of the problem statement but the user's inquiry.\n\nSo, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The unit circle has infinitely many rational points from primitive Pythagorean triples.\n- For two rational points x and y on the unit circle with angles α and β, where α < β.\n- Density requires a third rational point z with angle γ such that α < γ < β.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the rational points on the unit circle are dense, such that between any two rational points x and y with angles α < β, there exists a rational point z with angle γ satisfying α < γ < β.\n\nBut wait, the original problem's title is \"Are the rationals on a unit circle dense?\" So perhaps the problem is to determine if they are dense, with the specific angle condition as the density criterion. So the problem is \"Are the rational points on the unit circle dense, in the sense that for any two such points with angles α < β, there exists a third rational point with angle γ between α and β?\"\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be phrased as \"Prove that the rational points on the unit circle are dense...\" but since the user is asking \"how would one go about...\", maybe the problem is to prove the density.\n\nHowever, in the example, the formatted problem was a directive (\"Prove that...\"). So perhaps here the problem is \"Prove that the rational points on the unit circle are dense...\" with the angle condition.\n\nBut the user's actual question is asking both how to show the density and whether it's an unsolved problem. However, the example excluded the meta-question and focused on the mathematical directive. Therefore, following the example's structure, the problem part would be the mathematical statement to prove, and the meta-question about being unsolved is extra context that's omitted in the formatted problem.\n\nThus, the assumptions are the existence of infinitely many rational points via Pythagorean triples, the definition of density via angles, and the problem is to prove density under that definition.\n\nFinal structured problem:\n\nAssumption:\n- There are infinitely many rational points on the unit circle derived from primitive Pythagorean triples.\n- For any two rational points x and y on the unit circle with angles α and β, α < β.\n- A set is dense on the unit circle if between any two points there exists another point in the set.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the rational points on the unit circle are dense.\n\nWait, but the user's specific density condition is in terms of angles, which is a particular way to define density on the circle. Typically, density in the unit circle would mean that every open arc contains a rational point. The user's angle-based condition is equivalent to that. So perhaps the problem is to prove density in the unit circle in the sense that between any two rational points (by angle), there's another. But maybe the standard density definition is enough, and the angle condition is a restatement.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be as the user phrased: \"Show that they are dense, in the sense that for two rational points x and y of angles α and β on the unit circle, if α<β, there is a third rational point z of angle γ on the unit circle, such that α<γ<β.\"\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should include that angle condition as part of the problem statement.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n- The unit circle contains infinitely many rational points from primitive Pythagorean triples.\n- For two rational points x and y on the unit circle, their angles α and β satisfy α < β.\n- Density on the unit circle requires a rational point z with angle γ such that α < γ < β.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the rational points on the unit circle are dense, i.e., for any two rational points x and y with angles α < β, there exists a rational point z with angle γ between α and β.\n\nBut maybe some assumptions can be merged or simplified. For example, the existence of infinitely many points is given, but the problem is to prove density. The key assumptions are about the angle ordering and the density condition.\n\nAlternatively, the assumptions could be:\n\n- There exist infinitely many rational points on the unit circle.\n- Two points on the unit circle can be associated with angles α and β.\n- Density is defined as the existence of a third point between any two points in angular measure.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the set of rational points on the unit circle is dense under the angular measure.\n\nBut the user's specific angle condition is part of the problem statement, so perhaps it's better to include it explicitly.\n\nAfter considering, here's the structured format:\n\nAssumption:\n- The unit circle has infinitely many rational points obtained from primitive Pythagorean triples.\n- For any two distinct rational points on the unit circle, their angles α and β satisfy α < β.\n- A subset of the unit circle is dense if between any two points, there exists another point from the subset.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the rational points on the unit circle are dense, i.e., for any two rational points with angles α < β, there exists a rational point with angle γ such that α < γ < β.",
