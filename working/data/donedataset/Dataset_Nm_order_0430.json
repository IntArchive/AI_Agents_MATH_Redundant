    "Content": "If $\\mathcal{M}=\\{M_i : i\\in I_n\\}$ is a collection of metric spaces, each with metric $d_i$, we can make $M=\\prod_{i\\in I_n}M_i$ a metric space using the $p$-norm, we simply set $d : M\\times M\\to \\mathbb{R}$ as: $$d((p_1,\\dots,p_n),(q_1,\\dots,q_n))=\\left\\|(d(p_1,q_1),\\dots,d(p_n,q_n))\\right\\|_p$$ What I want to prove is that the $p$-norm $$\\left\\|x\\right\\|_p=\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left|x_i\\right|^p\\right)^{1/p}$$ is really a norm. Showing that $\\left\\|x\\right\\|_p \\geq 0$ being zero if and only if $x = 0$ was easy. Showing that $\\left\\|kx\\right\\|_p = \\left|k\\right|\\left\\|x\\right\\|_p$ was also easy. The triangle inequality is the thing that is not being easy to show. Indeed, I want to show that: for every $x,y \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ we have: $$\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left|x_i+y_i\\right|^p\\right)^{1/p}\\leq \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left|x_i\\right|^p\\right)^{1/p}+\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left|y_i\\right|^p\\right)^{1/p}.$$ I thought that it might not be as difficult as it seems, but after trying a little without sucess I've searched on the internet and the I found that we need measure theory to prove that. Is there any more elementary proof of this inequality?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "(I learned from Terry Tao the following proof, which exploits a symmetry to simplify the task of proving an estimate by normalising one or more inconvenient factors to equal $1$.) I assume here that $1\\leq p<\\infty$. We want to show that\n$$\n\\|x+y\\|_p\\leq\\|x\\|_p+\\|y\\|_p\\tag{*}\n$$\nWhen the RHS is $0$, the proof is trivial. Suppose it is positive. By homogeneity $\\|cx\\|_p=|c|\\|x\\|_p$ we may reduce to the case $\\|x\\|_p=1-\\lambda$ and $\\|y\\|_p=\\lambda$ for some $0\\leq\\lambda\\leq 1$. The cases $\\lambda=0,1$ are trivial, so suppose $0<\\lambda<1$. Writing $X:=x/(1-\\lambda)$ and $Y:=y/\\lambda$ we reduce to the convexity estimate:\n$$\n\\|(1-\\lambda)X+\\lambda Y\\|_p\\leq 1\\quad\\text{whenever } \\|X\\|_p=\\|Y\\|_p=1\\\n\\text{and }0\\leq\\lambda\\leq 1.\n$$\nBut since $z\\mapsto|z|^p$ is convex for $p\\geq 1$, we have the coordinate-wise convexity bound\n$$\n|(1-\\lambda)X_i+\\lambda Y_i|^p\\leq (1-\\lambda)|X_i|^p+\\lambda |Y_i|^p.\n$$\nSumming $i$ from $1$ to $n$, we obtain \n$$\n\\|(1-\\lambda)X+\\lambda Y\\|_p^p\\leq 1\n$$\nand thus the claim follows. Note that this proof works for the general abstract $L^p$ spaces as well.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The user provided an example where they listed assumptions and then the problem. So first, I need to parse the original question from Math Stack Exchange.\n\nThe title is \"How to prove triangle inequality for $p$-norm?\" and the question body talks about metric spaces constructed using the $p$-norm. The user wants to prove that the $p$-norm is indeed a norm by verifying the triangle inequality. They mention that they found references to measure theory being used but are asking for a more elementary proof.\n\nSo, the problem here is to prove the triangle inequality for the $p$-norm, specifically Minkowski's inequality. The assumptions would be the conditions under which this inequality holds. Let me list the assumptions step by step.\n\nFirst, the $p$-norm is defined for vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, so one assumption is that $x$ and $y$ are vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Then, the norm is defined with a parameter $p$, so we need to specify the condition on $p$. Typically, Minkowski's inequality holds for $p \\geq 1$. Therefore, another assumption is that $p$ is a real number greater than or equal to 1. Also, the absolute values in the norm imply that we're dealing with real numbers, but since the vectors are in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, that's covered.\n\nLooking at the example, each assumption is a single property applied to one object. So here, the assumptions would be:\n\n- $x$ and $y$ are vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ (since the problem states \"for every $x,y \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$\").\n- $p$ is a real number such that $p \\geq 1$ (since for $p < 1$, the triangle inequality doesn't hold and the $p$-norm isn't a norm).\n\nI need to check if there are any other implicit assumptions. The problem mentions the $p$-norm as defined, which inherently uses the sum of absolute values raised to $p$ and then the 1/p power. So another possible assumption is that each component of the vectors $x$ and $y$ are real numbers, but that's already covered by being in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. \n\nThe original problem setup also mentions a collection of metric spaces and constructing a product metric using the $p$-norm, but the specific problem the user wants to solve is about proving the triangle inequality for the $p$-norm on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, so the other parts about metric spaces might be context but not part of the core assumptions for this specific inequality. The user is focusing on the $p$-norm on real vectors.\n\nSo, compiling the assumptions:\n\n1. $x$ is a vector in $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n2. $y$ is a vector in $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n3. $p$ is a real number with $p \\geq 1$.\n\nEach of these is a separate line in the Assumption section.\n\nThe problem statement is then to prove the triangle inequality as stated, which is Minkowski's inequality. The user is asking for an elementary proof without measure theory, but the problem statement itself is just to prove the inequality.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n- $x$ is a vector in $\\mathbb{R}^n$,\n- $y$ is a vector in $\\mathbb{R}^n$,\n- $p$ is a real number with $p \\geq 1$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that for every $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, \n$$\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left|x_i + y_i\\right|^p\\right)^{1/p} \\leq \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left|x_i\\right|^p\\right)^{1/p} + \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left|y_i\\right|^p\\right)^{1/p}.$$\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem had an assumption that $n$ is divisible by 7, which was part of the problem's specific conditions. In this current problem, the assumptions are more general. The key here is to filter out any unrelated information. The user mentioned constructing a metric space using the $p$-norm for a product of metric spaces, but their actual problem is about proving the triangle inequality for the $p$-norm on $\\mathbb{R}^n$. So the metric space product part is context but not directly part of the problem's assumptions. Therefore, the assumptions should only pertain to the vectors and the value of $p$.\n\nYes, that's correct. The other details about the metric spaces $M_i$ and the product space $M$ are part of the original question's setup but aren't necessary for the specific inequality the user wants to prove. So we can disregard those in the assumptions and focus solely on the vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ and the parameter $p$.",
