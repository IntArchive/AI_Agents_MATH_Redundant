    "Content": "Possible Duplicate: Proof that an integral domain that is a finite-dimensional $F$-vector space is in fact a field I need to prove this result, but the only starting point I think of is to argue by contradiction, by assuming $x$ is non-invertible and extending it to a basis over $K$ but have no idea how to go further than that. Any ideas?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "We will prove this using the Rank - Nullity Theorem applied to $A$ viewing it as a finite dimensional vector space over $K$. Pick a non-zero element $y \\in A$ and consider the $K$ - linear transformation $$\\begin{eqnarray*} T&\\colon&A \\longrightarrow A \\\\\n&& x\\mapsto yx.\\end{eqnarray*} $$ Now the kernel of this linear transformation is trivial because $A$ is an integral domain, and hence by rank-nullity we have that $$\\begin{eqnarray*} \\dim_K A &=& \\dim \\ker T + \\dim \\operatorname{im} T \\\\\n&=& 0 + \\dim \\operatorname{im} T\\\\\n&=& \\dim \\operatorname{im} T \\end{eqnarray*}$$ from which it follows that $T$ is surjective. In particular there exists $z \\in A$ such that $zy = 1$, so that since $y$ was arbitrary we have shown that every element in $A$ is invertible, i.e. $A$ is a field. Edit: I should say it is important to include the hypothesis that $A$ is an integral domain otherwise the result is not necessarily true. Consider the $\\Bbb{C}$ - algebra $$\\Bbb{C} \\oplus \\Bbb{C} \\oplus \\Bbb{C} $$ as a finite dimensional vector space over $\\Bbb{C}$. This is not an integral domain because $(1,0,0) \\cdot (0,1,0) = (0,0,0)$. Now we also have $$\\dim_{\\Bbb{C}} \\big( \\Bbb{C} \\oplus \\Bbb{C} \\oplus \\Bbb{C} \\big) = 3 < \\infty$$ but $\\Bbb{C} \\oplus \\Bbb{C} \\oplus \\Bbb{C}$ cannot be a field because elements like $(1,0,0)$ don't have an inverse. If we also drop the hypothesis that $\\dim_K A < \\infty$ the result is not true as well. For example consider the polynomial ring $\\Bbb{C}[T]$ in the indeterminate $T$. This is an integral domain because $\\Bbb{C}$ is. Then if we view this as a vector space over $\\Bbb{C}$ it is infinite dimensional, but it is already a well known fact that $\\Bbb{C}[T]$ is not a field.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about proving that if an integral domain A contains a field K and A is a finite-dimensional vector space over K, then A is a field. \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. Each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. Let's break down the problem:\n\n1. A is an integral domain. That's one property of A.\n2. A contains a field K. So K is a subfield of A.\n3. A is a finite-dimensional vector space over K. This is another condition on A related to K.\n\nThe problem is to prove that under these conditions, A is a field. \n\nWait, the original question on Math Stack Exchange mentions that it's a possible duplicate and refers to another proof. But the user is asking for help with their approach, which involves assuming an element x is non-invertible and trying to extend it to a basis. However, for the structured format, we need to filter out the unrelated parts like the user's initial thoughts and focus on the core problem.\n\nSo the assumptions are clear: A is an integral domain containing K, and A is finite-dimensional over K. The problem is to prove A is a field. The example given in the initial instruction had assumptions listed line by line, each with one condition. So here, each of the three points I listed would be separate assumptions.\n\nLet me check the example again. In the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem as given, the user didn't state that n is divisible by 7. The example's formatted problem added that assumption. Wait, no, looking back: the original problem was to prove for every integer n, the expression is divisible by 91. The formatted problem had assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect because the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7. Hmm, maybe there was a mistake in the example. Wait, perhaps the example was a different problem. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that contradicts because the original problem says \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem adds an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Maybe the example was incorrect, but the user provided it as their example. So perhaps in their example, they had a mistake, but we have to follow their format regardless.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user's original problem doesn't have extra assumptions beyond A being an integral domain containing K and being a finite-dimensional vector space over K. So for the current problem, the assumptions should be:\n\n- A is an integral domain.\n- A contains a field K.\n- A is a finite-dimensional vector space over K.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that A is a field.\n\nBut wait, in the example, even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n,\" the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like an error. But perhaps the example was a different scenario where the original problem had some hidden assumptions. Maybe I need to be careful here. In the current problem, the original question is correct as stated: A is an integral domain containing K, and A is a finite-dimensional K-vector space. So all these are the given conditions. The user wants to prove A is a field. So the assumptions should be exactly those three points.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list each of these as separate assumptions, each on a new line. Then the problem statement is to prove that A is a field.",
