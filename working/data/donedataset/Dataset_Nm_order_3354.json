    "Content": "Struggling with yet another proof: Prove that, for any positive integer $n: (a + b)^n \\geq a^n + b^n$ for all $a, b > 0:$ I wasted $3$ pages of notebook paper on this problem, and I'm getting nowhere slowly. So I need some hints. $1.$ What technique would you use to prove this (e.g. induction, direct, counter example) $2.$ Are there any tricks to the proof? I've seen some crazy stuff pulled out of nowhere when it comes to proofs...",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Hint: Use the binomial theorem. This states that $(a + b)^n = \\sum \\limits_{k = 0}^n {n \\choose k} a^{n-k} b^k = a^n + b^n + \\sum \\limits_{k=1}^{n-1} {n \\choose k} a^{n-k} b^k$ . Now, note that every term in the second sum is positive; this is because a, b, and the binomial coefficients are all positive. Therefore, $(a+b)^n=a^n+b^n+\\text{ (sum of positive terms) }\\geqslant a^n+b^n\\;.$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original problem is about proving that for any positive integer n, (a + b)^n is greater than or equal to a^n + b^n where a and b are positive. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states \"for any positive integer n\" and \"for all a, b > 0\". So each of these should be separate assumptions. The user's example split the assumptions into separate lines, each addressing one condition. So here, the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is a positive integer\n- a is greater than 0\n- b is greater than 0\n\nThen the problem statement itself is to prove that (a + b)^n ≥ a^n + b^n. \n\nWait, but the example given in the user's prompt had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't explicitly in the original problem's first line. However, in the example, maybe the original problem had that condition. Wait, no, looking back, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Hmm, perhaps that was a mistake? Or maybe there was additional context. Wait, maybe the user's example was from a different problem. Let me check again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like an error. Wait, 91 is 7*13, so perhaps the problem actually requires that n is such that 5^n makes the expression divisible by 7 and 13. But maybe the example was incorrect. However, the user's instruction is to filter unrelated information and structure the problem. So maybe in the example, the user added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. That might be confusing. But perhaps I should follow the user's example as given, even if the example has an error. But in this case, the problem we're handling now is the one about (a + b)^n ≥ a^n + b^n.\n\nThe original problem here is to prove that for any positive integer n, and for all a, b > 0, the inequality holds. The assumptions would then be:\n\n- n is a positive integer\n- a is greater than 0\n- b is greater than 0\n\nEach on separate lines. The problem is to prove the inequality. The user's example had an assumption that wasn't in the original problem's first line, but maybe because the original problem had hidden conditions. In our current case, the problem clearly states \"for any positive integer n\" and \"for all a, b > 0\". So these are the assumptions. There's no hidden condition here. So the formatted problem should list each of these as separate assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\na is greater than 0,\nb is greater than 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that for all a, b > 0 and any positive integer n, the inequality $(a + b)^n \\geq a^n + b^n$ holds.",
