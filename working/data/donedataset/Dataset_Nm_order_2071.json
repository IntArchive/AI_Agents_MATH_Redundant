    "Content": "(doCarmo, Riemannian Geometry, p.56, Q2) I want to prove that the Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$ is given by $$ (\\nabla_X Y)(p) = \\frac{d}{dt} \\Big(P_{c,t_0,t}^{-1}(Y(c(t)) \\Big) \\Big|_{t=t_0}, $$ where $p \\in M$, $c \\colon I \\to M$ is an integral curve of $X$ through $p$, and $P_{c,t_0,t} \\colon T_{c(t_0)}M \\to T_{c(t)}M$ is the parallel transport along $c$, from $t_0$ to $t$. My approach is to use the uniqueness of the Levi-Civita connection (a theorem proved elsewhere in the textbook) and show that the RHS satisfies all of its properties, i.e. It is an affine connection, It is symmetric, It is compatible with the metric. However, for the first part, I am stuck on proving that $$ \\nabla_{fX + gY}Z = f \\nabla_X Z + g \\nabla_Y Z. $$ So far, I have the following $$ f \\nabla_X Z = f \\Big( \\frac{d}{dt} \\Big( P_{c_X,t_0,t}^{-1}(Z(c_X(t)) \\Big) \\Big|_{t=t_0} \\Big), $$ $$ g \\nabla_Y Z = g \\Big( \\frac{d}{dt} \\Big( P_{c_Y,t_0,t}^{-1}(Z(c_Y(t)) \\Big) \\Big|_{t=t_0}  \\Big), $$ $$ \\nabla_{fX + gY}Z =  \\frac{d}{dt} \\Big( P_{c,t_0,t}^{-1}(Z(c(t)) \\Big) \\Big|_{t=t_0}, $$\nwhere $$ c_X (t_0) = c_Y (t_0) = c(t_0) = p, $$ $$ \\frac{d c_X}{dt} = X(c_X(t)), $$ $$ \\frac{d c_Y}{dt} = Y(c_Y(t)), $$ $$ \\frac{d c}{dt} = fX(c(t)) + gY(c(t)). $$ I'm sure the solution is something simple like working in local coordinates but I'm having trouble so any direction would be appreciated.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You can probably make your idea work but it won't be easy. The reason is that your formula that recovers the connection from the parallel transport is true not only for the Levi-Civita connection but also for arbitrary connections. This means that in order to identify the right hand side as the Levi-Civita connection, you will need to understand what makes the parallel transport of the Levi-Civita connection special compared with the parallel transport of a general connection. The compatibility with the metric is easy - this implies that parallel transport is an isometry. However, to understand how the symmetry affects the parallel transport is much more delicate (see here for example). A much less painful way to solve the exercise is to use the notion of a parallel frame along $c$ (which if I remember correctly is introduced in one of the other exercises). Namely, pick some basis of $\\xi_1(p), \\dots, \\xi_n(p)$ of $T_pM$ and extend it by parallel transport to a frame $(\\xi_1, \\dots, \\xi_n)$ of vectors fields along $c$ . Now, write the restriction of $Y$ to $c(t)$ as $Y = Y^i(t) \\xi_i(c(t))$ (summation convention is in use) and note that $$ (\\nabla_X Y)(c(t)) = \\frac{DY(c(t))}{dt} = \\dot{Y}^i(t) \\xi_i(c(t)) + Y^i(t) \\frac{D\\xi_i(t)}{dt} = \\dot{Y}^i(t) \\xi_i (c(t)) $$ which means that the covariant derivative relative to the frame $\\xi_i$ is given simply by the regular derivative. Then, $$ \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( P_{c,t_0, t}^{-1}(Y(c(t)) \\right)|_{t = t_0} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( P_{c,t_0, t}^{-1}(Y^i(t) \\xi_i(c(t))) \\right)|_{t = t_0} \\\\\n= \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( Y^i(t) \\xi_i(p) \\right)|_{t = t_0} = \\dot{Y}^i(t_0) \\xi_i(p) = (\\nabla_X Y)(p).$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. Let me first read through the original question carefully to understand what's being asked and identify all the assumptions.\n\nThe user is working on problem Q2 from doCarmo's Riemannian Geometry, page 56. The main goal is to prove that the Levi-Civita connection can be expressed using parallel transport. The user's approach is to show that the right-hand side (RHS) of the given formula satisfies the properties of the Levi-Civita connection: being an affine connection, symmetric, and compatible with the metric. However, they're stuck on proving the affine property, specifically linearity over smooth functions in the direction argument, which is ∇_{fX + gY}Z = f∇_X Z + g∇_Y Z.\n\nNow, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. Let's go step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem statement is to prove that the Levi-Civita connection ∇ is given by the formula involving parallel transport. The assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. From the question, we know:\n\n1. The setting is a Riemannian manifold M with Levi-Civita connection ∇.\n2. p is a point in M.\n3. c: I → M is an integral curve of X through p, meaning c(t₀) = p and dc/dt = X(c(t)).\n4. P_{c,t₀,t} is the parallel transport along c from t₀ to t.\n5. The expression for (∇_X Y)(p) is given as the derivative of the inverse parallel transport applied to Y(c(t)) evaluated at t = t₀.\n6. The user is attempting to verify that this expression satisfies the properties of an affine connection, specifically the linearity in the direction (X here).\n\nWait, but the problem as posed by doCarmo might not have all these as assumptions. The original problem is to prove that the connection is given by that formula. The user is trying to use the uniqueness theorem, which requires showing the RHS has the properties of the Levi-Civita connection. However, in their attempt, they've encountered a roadblock with the linearity over functions f and g.\n\nSo, the main problem is to prove the given formula for the Levi-Civita connection using the properties. The assumptions would include the definitions and conditions given in the problem statement. Let me parse the original problem again:\n\nThe problem states that given p ∈ M, c is an integral curve of X through p, and P is the parallel transport. The formula is presented, and the task is to prove that ∇ is given by that formula. The user is using the uniqueness theorem by checking properties. Their specific issue is proving the linearity over functions in the direction.\n\nBut in terms of assumptions for the problem (not the user's approach), we need to list the conditions given in the problem. The problem is in doCarmo's book, so standard Riemannian geometry context applies: M is a Riemannian manifold with Levi-Civita connection ∇. The integral curve c is such that its derivative is X, and P is the parallel transport along c. The formula involves taking the derivative of the inverse parallel transport of Y along c.\n\nBut the user is stuck on a specific part: proving the linearity ∇_{fX + gY}Z = f∇_X Z + g∇_Y Z. However, when structuring the problem, the assumptions should be the given conditions in the problem, not the user's specific roadblock. The user's specific problem within their approach is part of their question, but the task here is to structure the original problem from the textbook as per the format.\n\nWait, the user is asking for help with their approach to proving the formula by checking the properties, specifically stuck on the linearity part. So the problem they are presenting is the original doCarmo problem, and their specific issue is part of their attempt, but the formatted problem should capture the original problem from the textbook.\n\nBut looking at the user's question: \"Recovering connection from parallel transport\" with the problem statement as in doCarmo. The user wants to prove the given formula for ∇ using the uniqueness of Levi-Civita connection by verifying its properties. Their specific hurdle is proving the affine linearity. However, when structuring the problem according to the format, we need to present the original problem's assumptions and problem statement.\n\nSo the original problem's assumptions are:\n\n1. M is a Riemannian manifold with Levi-Civita connection ∇.\n2. p is a point in M.\n3. c: I → M is an integral curve of X through p, i.e., c(t₀) = p and dc/dt = X(c(t)).\n4. P_{c,t₀,t} is the parallel transport along c from t₀ to t.\n5. The expression for (∇_X Y)(p) is defined as the derivative of the inverse parallel transport of Y(c(t)) evaluated at t₀.\n\nThe problem is to prove that this expression indeed equals the Levi-Civita connection ∇_X Y at p.\n\nHowever, in the example provided, the assumptions listed are specific conditions given in the problem. For instance, in the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7, which were part of the problem's original conditions.\n\nIn the current case, the problem is from doCarmo, which assumes standard Riemannian manifold setup. The key assumptions here would be:\n\n- M is a Riemannian manifold with Levi-Civita connection ∇.\n- For a point p ∈ M, c is an integral curve of a vector field X through p.\n- Parallel transport along c is defined as P_{c,t₀,t}.\n- The expression for ∇_X Y is given in terms of the derivative of the inverse parallel transport.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that the given formula recovers the Levi-Civita connection. The user's attempt is to use the uniqueness theorem by verifying the properties, and they are stuck on one part. However, when structuring the problem, we need to present the problem as posed in the textbook, not the user's specific difficulty.\n\nWait, the user is quoting the problem: \"Recovering connection from parallel transport\" (doCarmo, Riemannian Geometry, p.56, Q2). The problem as stated is to prove that the Levi-Civita connection is given by that formula involving parallel transport. The user then explains their approach and where they're stuck.\n\nSo the actual problem to be formatted is doCarmo's problem: Prove that the Levi-Civita connection is given by the formula using parallel transport. The assumptions here are the standard Riemannian manifold structure, existence of integral curves, and the definition of parallel transport. But according to the example, assumptions should list each condition applied to one object.\n\nLet me list the assumptions based on the problem statement:\n\nAssumptions:\n- M is a Riemannian manifold.\n- ∇ is the Levi-Civita connection on M.\n- p is a point in M.\n- c: I → M is an integral curve of X through p (i.e., c(t₀) = p and dc/dt = X(c(t))).\n- P_{c,t₀,t}: T_{c(t₀)}M → T_{c(t)}M is the parallel transport along c from t₀ to t.\n- The expression for (∇_X Y)(p) is defined as the derivative of P_{c,t₀,t}^{-1}(Y(c(t))) evaluated at t = t₀.\n\nProblem: Prove that the Levi-Civita connection ∇ is given by the formula (∇_X Y)(p) = d/dt [P_{c,t₀,t}^{-1}(Y(c(t)))]|_{t=t₀}.\n\nBut in the user's description, they also mention that they are trying to verify the properties of the Levi-Civita connection (affine, symmetric, metric compatible). The problem is to prove the formula, and the approach is to show the RHS satisfies these properties. The user is stuck on proving the affine property (linearity over functions in the direction).\n\nBut in formatting the problem, we need to present the original problem's assumptions and the problem statement, not the user's specific step. The user's specific issue is part of their attempt but not the problem's assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should capture the original problem from doCarmo, which is to prove that the given expression equals the Levi-Civita connection. The assumptions would be the necessary conditions given in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem as posed in doCarmo doesn't list all these assumptions explicitly but relies on the standard setup. However, the user does mention integral curves and parallel transport, which are key components.\n\nSo, to structure the problem:\n\nAssumption:\n- M is a Riemannian manifold with Levi-Civita connection ∇.\n- For any vector field X and point p ∈ M, c is an integral curve of X through p.\n- P_{c,t₀,t} is the parallel transport along c from t₀ to t.\n- The expression for ∇_X Y at p involves the derivative of the inverse parallel transport of Y along c evaluated at t₀.\n\nProblem: Prove that (∇_X Y)(p) = d/dt [P_{c,t₀,t}^{-1}(Y(c(t)))]|_{t=t₀}.\n\nBut perhaps more precisely, the key assumptions are about the integral curve and parallel transport. Let me break them down line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\n- M is a Riemannian manifold.\n- ∇ is the Levi-Civita connection on M.\n- p is a point in M.\n- c: I → M is a smooth curve with c(t₀) = p.\n- The curve c is an integral curve of X, i.e., dc/dt = X(c(t)) for all t ∈ I.\n- P_{c,t₀,t} is the parallel transport along c from T_{c(t₀)}M to T_{c(t)}M.\n- Y is a vector field on M.\n\nProblem: Prove that the Levi-Civita connection satisfies $$ (\\nabla_X Y)(p) = \\frac{d}{dt} \\Big|_{t=t_0} P_{c,t_0,t}^{-1}(Y(c(t))). $$\n\nYes, that seems to capture the problem. Each assumption is a single condition on one object. The problem is to prove the equality for the connection.\n\nThe user's specific difficulty with the linearity over functions is part of their attempt, but the formatted problem should just present the original problem from the textbook. Therefore, the assumptions are those inherent to the problem statement, and the problem is to prove the given formula for ∇.",
