    "AcceptedAnswer": "The larger piece is always between 1/2 and 1.  If the break is uniformly distributed along the bar, the larger piece is uniformly distributed between 1/2 and 1.  This gives the expected value of 3/4. Added when we have break lines:  If there are $n$ pieces, there are $n-1$ break lines, all equally probable.  If $(n-1)$ is even, the size of the largest piece has chance $\\frac{2}{n-1}$ of being any step between $\\frac{n+1}{2n}$ and $\\frac{n-1}{n}$, so the expectation is $\\frac{3n-1}{4n}$.  If $(n-1)$ is odd there is $\\frac{1}{n-1}$ chance the \"larger\" piece is $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\frac{2}{n-1}$ for each value between $\\frac{n+1}{2n}$ and $\\frac{n-1}{n}$, giving $\\frac{3n-4}{4n-4}$ as the expected value.  As stated in other answers, this is always below $\\frac{3}{4}$, but approaches that as $n \\to \\infty$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this chocolate bar problem. So, the question is about splitting a chocolate bar into two pieces randomly and finding the expected size of the larger piece. The original statement was that the expectation is 3/4 of the bar, and then the update generalizes it to n chunks and the buddy claims it's ≤3/4.\n\nFirst, I need to clarify the problem setup. The user mentions thinking of the chocolate bar as a 1D array, which probably means it's a straight line of chocolate, like a bar divided into segments. The update says it's a bar with n chunks, and when broken randomly along these chunks, we need the expected size of the larger chunk. So maybe each chunk is a segment, and the break happens between two chunks. Wait, but if there are n chunks, then there are n-1 possible places to break it. So breaking it at a random position would mean choosing one of the n-1 positions uniformly, right?\n\nWait, but the original problem without the update was about splitting into two pieces, so maybe the bar is considered as a continuous 1D bar, and you break it at a random point along its length. Then the size of each piece would be a fraction between 0 and 1, and the larger piece would be max(x, 1-x), where x is the position of the break. Then the expectation of max(x, 1-x) when x is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1.\n\nLet me check that. If the bar is a unit length [0,1], and you break it at a random point X uniformly in [0,1]. Then the two pieces are X and 1-X. The larger piece is max(X, 1-X). The expected value would be E[max(X,1-X)]. Let's compute that.\n\nSince X is uniform on [0,1], the distribution of X is symmetric around 0.5. So, for X in [0, 0.5], max(X, 1-X) = 1 - X, and for X in [0.5, 1], it's X. Therefore, the integral to compute the expectation is the integral from 0 to 0.5 of (1 - x) dx plus the integral from 0.5 to 1 of x dx.\n\nCalculating that:\n\nIntegral from 0 to 0.5 of (1 - x) dx = [x - (x²)/2] from 0 to 0.5 = (0.5 - (0.25)/2) - 0 = 0.5 - 0.125 = 0.375.\n\nIntegral from 0.5 to 1 of x dx = [x²/2] from 0.5 to 1 = (1/2 - 0.25/2) = (0.5 - 0.125) = 0.375.\n\nAdding both parts: 0.375 + 0.375 = 0.75. So the expectation is 3/4. That's where the original 3/4 comes from. So in the continuous case, the expected size of the larger piece is indeed 3/4.\n\nBut then the update complicates things by considering the bar divided into n chunks. Now, the problem becomes discrete. Instead of breaking at any point along a continuous bar, you have to break between chunks. So for a bar with n chunks, there are n-1 possible places to break. Each break would divide the bar into two parts: one with k chunks and the other with n - k chunks, where k ranges from 1 to n-1. The question is then, if you choose a break point uniformly at random (i.e., each of the n-1 possible positions is equally likely), what is the expected size of the larger piece? And the buddy claims it's ≤ 3/4.\n\nSo first, for the continuous case, the expectation is exactly 3/4, but in the discrete case with n chunks, the expectation might be less than or equal to 3/4.\n\nSo the user wants to know how to arrive at 3/4 in the continuous case and then understand why for the discrete case with n chunks, the expectation is ≤3/4.\n\nFirst, let's structure the problem as per the required format. The original problem before the update was about a continuous bar, leading to expectation 3/4. The update generalizes to n chunks, expecting the answer to be ≤3/4. But the user's main question is to explain why the expectation is 3/4 in the original case and possibly address the discrete case.\n\nBut according to the problem formatting example, we need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the problem:\n\nOriginal question: \"if I split a chocolate bar at random into two pieces, then the expected size of the larger piece is 3/4 of the bar. Can someone explain this? Provide a proof?\"\n\nUpdate: \"Imagine the candy bar is a world-famous chocolate bar, the ones that are broken into chunks. However, this special chocolate bar has n chunks. If we broke the chocolate bar randomly along these chunks, what would the expected size of the larger chunk be? My buddy claims it to be ≤3/4.\"\n\nSo the assumptions here would be:\n\nFor the original problem (continuous case):\n\n- The chocolate bar is split into two pieces at a uniformly random position.\n\nFor the updated problem (discrete case with n chunks):\n\n- The chocolate bar consists of n chunks arranged in a 1D array.\n\n- The bar is broken at a random position between chunks (i.e., one of the n-1 possible positions is chosen uniformly).\n\nBut the problem statement in the update is to find the expected size of the larger chunk when broken randomly, with the claim that it's ≤3/4.\n\nSo the user is presenting two related problems:\n\n1. Continuous case: split at random, expected larger piece is 3/4. Need proof.\n\n2. Discrete case with n chunks: expected larger chunk ≤3/4. Need proof.\n\nBut the original answer request was for the first part, but the update adds the second part.\n\nSo to structure the problem according to the required format, perhaps separate them. But the user is combining both into one problem now. Wait, in the update, the user is modifying the original problem. So the problem now is: Given a chocolate bar with n chunks, broken randomly along these chunks, what's the expected size of the larger chunk, and show it's ≤3/4.\n\nBut the original problem (without the update) is a specific case where n is continuous (treated as n approaching infinity?), leading to 3/4. The update makes it discrete with n chunks and asks for the expectation, which the buddy claims is ≤3/4.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions for the updated problem would be:\n\n- The chocolate bar has n chunks arranged in a line.\n\n- The bar is broken at one of the n-1 positions between chunks, each chosen with equal probability.\n\n- Each chunk is of equal size (assuming the chunks are identical; the problem doesn't specify, but to compute the size, we can assume each chunk is size 1/n, so the total size is 1. Alternatively, if the chunks are of different sizes, the problem would be more complex. However, since the problem says \"broken into chunks\", but the size of each chunk isn't specified, it's safer to assume that all chunks are equal. Otherwise, the problem would be underdetermined.\n\nSo the key assumptions:\n\n1. The chocolate bar is divided into n equal-sized chunks.\n\n2. The break occurs at one of the n−1 positions between chunks, chosen uniformly at random.\n\n3. The size of the bar is normalized to 1 (so each chunk has size 1/n).\n\nProblem: Find the expected size of the larger piece after the break, and show that it is ≤ 3/4.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is to consider both cases, but the user's main question is the continuous case (original) and the discrete case (update). But the answer needs to structure the problem as per the user's latest update.\n\nBut according to the user's instruction, the task is to read the question on Math Stack Exchange, filter unrelated information, and structure the problem into Assumption and Problem parts.\n\nIn the original problem, before the update, the user's friend claims the expectation is 3/4. The user can't figure out why. Then the update adds the case where the chocolate has n chunks and asks for the expectation, which the buddy claims is ≤3/4.\n\nSo perhaps the formatted problem should address both scenarios. But the example given in the prompt only has one problem. Let's check the example:\n\nOriginal problem was about proving A(n) divisible by 91, and the formatted problem lists two assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. The problem is to prove divisibility by 91.\n\nIn the current case, the problem has two parts: continuous and discrete. But the user is probably looking for the discrete case now with the update, but the original continuous case is simpler. However, the way the question is written now, after the update, the problem is about the discrete case with n chunks. The original problem was continuous. So maybe the formatted problem should capture the discrete case with n chunks, and the assumptions accordingly.\n\nBut the user's friend claims the expectation is ≤3/4, which in the continuous case is exactly 3/4, but in the discrete case, it's less. So perhaps the problem is to show that for the discrete case, the expectation is ≤3/4.\n\nBut the problem statement is a bit ambiguous. However, given the update, the user is asking about the discrete case with n chunks. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- The chocolate bar is divided into n chunks arranged in a 1D array.\n\n- The bar is broken at a uniformly random position between chunks.\n\n- Each chunk has equal size (so total size is 1, each chunk is 1/n).\n\nProblem: Find the expected size of the larger piece and prove that it is ≤ 3/4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants a general answer that covers both continuous and discrete, but given the example, the answer should structure the problem as per the update.\n\nBut the original question had the continuous case with expectation 3/4, and the update adds the discrete case with expectation ≤3/4. So perhaps the problem as per the update is to find the expectation for the discrete case and show it's ≤3/4.\n\nThus, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The chocolate bar consists of n chunks.\n\n- The break is made uniformly at random between two adjacent chunks.\n\n- Each chunk is of equal size (total size 1).\n\nProblem: Prove that the expected size of the larger piece is ≤ 3/4.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is to compute the expectation for both cases, but the example only structures one problem. Since the user updated the question to the discrete case, probably the formatted problem should reflect that.\n\nBut to avoid missing information, perhaps list all relevant assumptions.\n\nWait, in the original problem, the user was confused about the 3/4 expectation. The answer would be explaining the continuous case. But the update complicates it with n chunks. But the user's current problem is the discrete case. However, the way the user writes, maybe he wants the continuous case explained, and then the discrete case's bound. But given the example, the problem should be structured as a single problem.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be split into two parts, but the formatting example only shows one problem. Therefore, perhaps the main problem after the update is the discrete case, so we structure that.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- The chocolate bar has n chunks arranged in a 1D array.\n\n- The bar is broken at one of the n−1 positions between chunks, each chosen with equal probability.\n\n- Each chunk is of equal size (1/n).\n\n- The size of the bar is normalized to 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that the expected size of the larger piece after breaking is ≤ 3/4.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is to find the expectation and show it's ≤3/4, then the problem statement would be that.\n\nBut the user's buddy claims it's ≤3/4, so the problem is to prove that.\n\nBut to check, the continuous case gives exactly 3/4, and the discrete case with n chunks would have expectation less than or equal to 3/4. For example, with n=2, breaking between the two chunks, each piece is 1/2, so the larger piece is 1/2, so expectation is 1/2, which is less than 3/4. For n=3, possible breaks after first or second chunk. Breaking after first: pieces 1/3 and 2/3, larger is 2/3. Breaking after second: same. So expectation is 2/3 ≈0.666..., which is less than 3/4. As n increases, the expectation approaches 3/4. So for any finite n, the expectation is less than 3/4, and as n→∞, it approaches 3/4.\n\nTherefore, the discrete case expectation is ≤3/4, with equality as n→infty.\n\nTherefore, the problem is to prove that for a chocolate bar with n chunks, when broken uniformly at random, the expected size of the larger piece is ≤3/4.\n\nSo the assumptions are as listed above.\n\nHence, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe chocolate bar has $n$ chunks,\nThe chocolate bar is broken at a uniformly random position between chunks,\nEach chunk has equal size,\nThe total size of the chocolate bar is 1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the expected size of the larger piece is $\\leq \\frac{3}{4}$.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the continuous case gives exactly 3/4, but the discrete case is less. So the problem is to prove the expectation is ≤3/4 when broken into n chunks.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user says \"My buddy claims it to be ≤ 3/4\". So the problem is to prove that expectation ≤3/4 for any n.\n\nHence, the assumptions and problem statement would be structured accordingly.",
