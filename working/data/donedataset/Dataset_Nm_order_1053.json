    "Content": "Let $f$ be a uniformly continuous function on A of $\\Bbb{R}$. How do I show that if $a_n$ is Cauchy, then $f(a_n)$ is Cauchy. This is what I have worked on, but it does not quite make sense since I feel like I didn't really use the given condition that $f$ is uniformly continuous. Let $\\epsilon>0$, $f$ is uniformly continuous, so there exists$\\delta>0$ st $|f(x)-f(y)|<\\epsilon$ for $|x-y|<\\delta$. Since $a_n$ is Cauchy, there exists $N>0$ such that $|a_n-a_m|<\\delta$ for $m,n>N$ Hence$|f(a_n)-f(a_m)|<\\epsilon$ for $m,n>N$. So $f(a_n)$ is Cauchy",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Your proof looks good.  You use uniform continuity to claim that for every $n,m>N$, $\\vert f(a_n)-f(a_m)\\vert<\\epsilon$.  If you only had continuity, $\\delta$ would depend on $x$ and hence you couldn't claim that $\\vert a_n-a_m\\vert<\\delta\\Longrightarrow\\vert f(a_n)-f(a_m)\\vert<\\epsilon$ for all $n,m>N$. Additional comment If $A$ is assumed to be closed, then uniform continuity is not necessary (only \"pointwise\" continuity).  This is since if $A$ is closed, $(a_n)$ is guaranteed to converge to some $a\\in A$.  Then, $f$ will be continuous at $a$ and the proof can be modified accordingly without using uniform continuity.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to read the original problem carefully. The question is about proving that a uniformly continuous function preserves Cauchy sequences. \n\nThe original problem states: Let $f$ be a uniformly continuous function on $A \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$. Show that if $(a_n)$ is a Cauchy sequence in $A$, then $f(a_n)$ is also Cauchy. The user provided their attempt, but they're unsure if they correctly used uniform continuity. \n\nLooking at the example given, the assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. So, first, I need to identify all the assumptions. The function $f$ is uniformly continuous on $A$, which is a subset of $\\mathbb{R}$. Then, $(a_n)$ is a Cauchy sequence in $A$. Each of these is a separate assumption.\n\nWait, does the problem specify anything else? The problem is to show that under these conditions, the image sequence is Cauchy. The example given had two assumptions: $n$ is an integer and $n$ is divisible by 7. Here, similarly, the assumptions are about $f$ being uniformly continuous on $A$ and $(a_n)$ being a Cauchy sequence in $A$. Each of these is a single condition applied to one object. \n\nSo the assumptions should be:\n1. $f$ is a uniformly continuous function on $A$.\n2. $A$ is a subset of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n3. $(a_n)$ is a Cauchy sequence in $A$.\n\nWait, but in the example, the subset wasn't mentioned. Wait, the original problem says \"on A of $\\mathbb{R}$\". So maybe $A$ being a subset of $\\mathbb{R}$ is part of the problem's setup but not an assumption that imposes a condition? Hmm. Let me check. \n\nIn the example, the assumption was \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". But in the problem presented here, the function is defined on $A$, which is a subset of $\\mathbb{R}$. The problem is about functions on subsets of $\\mathbb{R}$, but the key assumptions are the uniform continuity of $f$ and the Cauchy property of $(a_n)$. The fact that $A$ is a subset of $\\mathbb{R}$ is part of the problem's setting, but maybe not an assumption that's an active condition. However, sometimes in problems, the domain being a subset of $\\mathbb{R}$ could be important, but in this case, since we're dealing with uniform continuity, which is a property that depends on the domain. \n\nBut the user's example didn't include the domain as an assumption unless it was part of the problem's inherent setup. The example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. So maybe in this case, the assumptions should list the properties of the objects involved. So $f$ is uniformly continuous on $A$, and $(a_n)$ is Cauchy in $A$. The fact that $A$ is a subset of $\\mathbb{R}$ is part of the problem statement but not an assumption per se. Wait, the problem says \"Let $f$ be a uniformly continuous function on A of $\\mathbb{R}$\". So the domain is $A \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$. Maybe this is part of the problem's setup but not an assumption that's a condition. The key conditions are the uniform continuity and the sequence being Cauchy. \n\nSo the assumptions should be:\n- $f$ is uniformly continuous on $A$.\n- $(a_n)$ is a Cauchy sequence in $A$.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user wrote \"on A of $\\mathbb{R}$\", which is just specifying that $A$ is a subset of the reals. So perhaps that's part of the problem's context but not an assumption. The example given by the user didn't include the domain as an assumption unless necessary. So in the example, the problem was about divisibility by 91, and the assumptions were about $n$ being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem's main conditions are the uniform continuity and the Cauchy sequence. So I should list those two as assumptions. \n\nWait, but the original problem says \"Let $f$ be a uniformly continuous function on A of $\\Bbb{R}$\". So maybe the assumption is that $A$ is a subset of $\\mathbb{R}$, but that's more of a given. However, the key assumptions that are active in the proof are the uniform continuity and the sequence being Cauchy. The fact that $A$ is a subset of $\\mathbb{R}$ is just part of the problem's setting. So perhaps the assumptions should be:\n\n1. $f$ is uniformly continuous on $A$.\n2. $(a_n)$ is a Cauchy sequence in $A$.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about the variable's properties. Here, similarly, the assumptions are about the function's property and the sequence's property. So I think that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\n$f$ is a uniformly continuous function on $A$,\n$(a_n)$ is a Cauchy sequence in $A$.\n\nProblem:\nShow that if $a_n$ is Cauchy, then $f(a_n)$ is Cauchy.\n\nWait, but the original problem is to \"show that if $a_n$ is Cauchy, then $f(a_n)$ is Cauchy\". But the user's own work starts with the given that $a_n$ is Cauchy. So the problem is to show that under the uniform continuity of $f$, the image sequence is Cauchy. So the problem statement in the formatted version should reflect that. The problem is to show that $f(a_n)$ is Cauchy given the assumptions. So the problem line should be \"Prove that $f(a_n)$ is a Cauchy sequence.\"\n\nBut let me check the original problem's exact wording. The user wrote: \"How do I show that if $a_n$ is Cauchy, then $f(a_n)$ is Cauchy.\" So the problem is to show that implication. So the assumptions are that $f$ is uniformly continuous on $A$, and $a_n$ is a Cauchy sequence in $A$. Then the problem is to prove that $f(a_n)$ is Cauchy.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n$f$ is a uniformly continuous function on $A$,\n$(a_n)$ is a Cauchy sequence in $A$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $f(a_n)$ is a Cauchy sequence.\n\nYes, that seems correct. The problem is structured as: Given these assumptions, prove this conclusion.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is a single line. So \"f is uniformly continuous on A\" is one assumption. \"(a_n) is a Cauchy sequence in A\" is another. The fact that A is a subset of R is part of the problem's context but not an active assumption here. The key conditions needed for the proof are the uniform continuity and the sequence being Cauchy. The user's own attempt uses these two conditions, so those are the assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem should be as above.",
