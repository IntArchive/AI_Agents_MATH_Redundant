    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here is an outline of a proof for a more general fact. Let me know if you need more detail. If $\\varphi: A \\to B$ is a ring map between $k$-algebras where $B$ is finitely generated, then the preimage of a maximal ideal in $B$ is a maximal ideal in $A.$ Proof : For any ring map $\\phi:R \\to S$ and ideal $J\\subseteq S$ there is a natural injective map $$\\phi^*: \\dfrac{R}{\\phi^{-1}(J)} \\to \\dfrac{S}{J} \\ : \\ r + \\phi^{-1}(J) \\mapsto \\phi(r) +J.$$ Zariski's Lemma: If $k\\subseteq L$ is a field extension and $L=k[x_1,\\ldots, x_n]$ for some $x_i\\in L$ then $L$ is finite dimensional as a $k$ vector space. (i.e. For a field extension, \"ring finite\" $\\implies$ \"module finite\"). There is an injection $k\\to A/I$ for any proper ideal $I$ of $A.$ If $K\\subseteq L$ is a finite field extension and $R$ is a ring such that $K\\subseteq R \\subseteq L$ then $R$ is a field as well. Abuse notation a tiny little bit to regard our injections as subset inclusions, and for any maximal ideal $\\mathfrak{m}\\subset B$ we have the situation $$k\\subseteq \\frac{A}{\\varphi^{-1}( \\mathfrak{m})} \\subseteq \\frac{B}{\\mathfrak{m}}.$$ Since $B$ is a finitely generated $k$ algebra, so is $\\dfrac{B}{\\mathfrak{m}}.$ By Zariski's lemma we have the situation of point 4 above, so $\\varphi^{-1}(\\mathfrak{m})$ is a maximal ideal.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to format this Math Stack Exchange question according to the given example. Let me start by reading the original problem carefully.\n\nThe question is: \"Let $k$ be a field and let $A \\subset B$ be two finitely generated $k$-algebras. Prove that the contraction of any maximal ideal of $B$ is a maximal ideal of $A$.\"\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The example provided lists each assumption line by line, addressing one property or condition per line applied to one object.\n\nLooking at the problem, the assumptions are:\n\n1. $k$ is a field.\n2. $A$ is a finitely generated $k$-algebra.\n3. $B$ is a finitely generated $k$-algebra.\n4. $A$ is a subset of $B$ (i.e., there's an inclusion $A \\subset B$).\n5. The problem involves the contraction of a maximal ideal from $B$ to $A$.\n\nWait, but the contraction part is actually part of the problem statement, not an assumption. The assumptions are the given conditions before the \"Prove that\" part. So let me correct that.\n\nThe problem states that $k$ is a field, $A$ and $B$ are finitely generated $k$-algebras with $A \\subset B$. Then the task is to prove that contracting any maximal ideal of $B$ gives a maximal ideal of $A$. Therefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n- $k$ is a field.\n- $A$ is a finitely generated $k$-algebra.\n- $B$ is a finitely generated $k$-algebra.\n- $A$ is a subalgebra of $B$ (i.e., $A \\subset B$ as $k$-algebras).\n\nEach of these is a separate condition on different objects: $k$, $A$, $B$, and the inclusion $A \\subset B$. The problem is then to show that the contraction (preimage under the inclusion map) of any maximal ideal in $B$ is a maximal ideal in $A$.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is listed line by line, each addressing one property. The example had two assumptions: $n$ is an integer and $n$ is divisible by 7. Similarly, here each bullet point is a separate assumption.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n$k$ is a field,\n$A$ is a finitely generated $k$-algebra,\n$B$ is a finitely generated $k$-algebra,\n$A$ is a subalgebra of $B$ (i.e., $A \\subset B$).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the contraction of any maximal ideal of $B$ is a maximal ideal of $A$.\n\nWait, but in the original example, the user had included \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, but in the original problem, the statement was \"for every integer n\". However, in the example, the formatted problem added that assumption. Wait, no. Let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal problem in the example: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so n being an integer is given, but n being divisible by 7 was not part of the original problem. Wait, maybe there was a typo in the example. Let me check.\n\nThe original problem in the example says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that contradicts because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which would include all integers, not just those divisible by 7. Therefore, perhaps the example provided was incorrect, but the user is using it as a reference.\n\nBut regardless, the user's instruction says to list all the assumptions of the problem. So in the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- k is a field.\n\n- A is a finitely generated k-algebra.\n\n- B is a finitely generated k-algebra.\n\n- A is contained in B as k-algebras.\n\nThese are the given conditions. The problem is to prove that the contraction of any maximal ideal of B is a maximal ideal of A.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list those four assumptions, each on their own line.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". That suggests that perhaps the user made a mistake in the example, but the instruction here is to follow that format.\n\nWait, maybe the example was about a different problem where the user incorrectly added an assumption. But in the current problem, there's no such extra condition. So I need to stick to the original problem's assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be:\n\nAssumption:\n$k$ is a field,\n$A$ is a finitely generated $k$-algebra,\n$B$ is a finitely generated $k$-algebra,\n$A$ is a subalgebra of $B$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the contraction of any maximal ideal of $B$ is a maximal ideal of $A$.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each assumption is one line, each applies to one object. The problem is then stated concisely.",
