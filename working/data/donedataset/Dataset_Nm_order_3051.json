    "AcceptedAnswer": "(The following argument is adapted from Dümbgen, '' Bounding Standard Gaussian Tail Probabilities .'') Approximating $\\displaystyle \\int_x^{\\infty} e^{-t^2} \\, dt$ Suppose we want to approximate $\\displaystyle \\int_x^{\\infty} e^{-t^2} \\, dt$ with a function of the form $\\dfrac{e^{-x^2}}{h(x)}.$  Let\n$$\\Delta(x) = \\frac{e^{-x^2}}{h(x)} - \\int_x^{\\infty} e^{-t^2} \\, dt.$$ Then, if $h(x) \\to \\infty$ as $x \\to \\infty$, then $\\Delta(x) \\to 0$ as $x \\to \\infty$.  Because of this, we have the following. If $\\Delta'(x) > 0$ for all $x \\geq 0$ then $\\Delta(x)$ increases to $0$.  Therefore, $\\dfrac{e^{-x^2}}{h(x)}$ is a lower bound on $\\displaystyle \\int_x^{\\infty} e^{-t^2} \\, dt$ for $x \\geq 0$. Similarly, if $\\Delta'(x) < 0$ for all $x \\geq 0$ then $\\Delta(x)$ decreases to $0$.  Therefore, $\\dfrac{e^{-x^2}}{h(x)}$ is an upper bound on $\\displaystyle \\int_x^{\\infty} e^{-t^2} \\, dt$ for $x \\geq 0$. We have \n$$\\Delta'(x) = \\frac{e^{-x^2}}{h(x)^2} \\left(h(x)^2 - 2xh(x) - h'(x) \\right).$$\nThus the sign of $\\Delta'(x)$ is determined by the sign of $f(x) = h(x)^2 - 2xh(x) - h'(x)$. Given the bounds we're trying to show, let's consider functions of the form $h(x) = x + \\sqrt{x^2 + c}$.  Then $$f(x) = c - 1 - \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^2+c}}.$$  Thus $f(x)$ is decreasing on $[0, \\infty)$. The lower bound To have $f(x) > 0$ for all $x \\geq 0$, we need $$c > 1 + \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^2+c}}, \\:\\:\\:\\: x \\geq 0.$$ The smallest value of $c$ for which this holds is $c = 2$.  Therefore, \n$$\\frac{1}{x + \\sqrt{x^2+2}} < e^{x^2} \\int_x^{\\infty} e^{-t^2} \\, dt, \\:\\:\\:\\: x \\geq 0,$$ and $2$ is the smallest value of $c$ for which this bound holds for functions of the form $h(x) = x + \\sqrt{x^2 + c}$. The upper bound To have $f(x) < 0$ for all $x \\geq 0$ we can take $c = 1$.  However, we can do better this because $f(x)$ is decreasing.  If we find a larger value of $c$ such that $\\Delta(0)= 0$, then we will have $f(x) > 0$ on $[0, x_0)$ for some $x_0$ and then $f(x) < 0$ on $(x_0, \\infty)$.  Thus $\\Delta(x)$ will initially increase from $0$ and then decrease back to $0$, giving us a tighter upper bound.  Since $$\\Delta(0) = 0 \\Longleftrightarrow \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{c}} = \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-t^2}\\, dt = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2},$$\nwe have $c = \\dfrac{4}{\\pi}$ yielding a tighter upper bound than $c = 1$.\nTherefore, $$e^{x^2} \\int_x^{\\infty} e^{-t^2} \\, dt \\leq \\frac{1}{x + \\sqrt{x^2+\\frac{\\pi}{4}}},  \\:\\:\\:\\: x \\geq 0,$$ and $\\dfrac{\\pi}{4}$ is the smallest value of $c$ for which this bound holds for functions of the form $h(x) = x + \\sqrt{x^2 + c}$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should list each condition applied to one object, line by line, and then the problem statement.\n\nFirst, I need to read the original problem carefully. The inequality to prove is:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{x+\\sqrt{x^2+2}}<e^{x^2}\\int\\limits_x^{\\infty}e^{-t^2} \\, \\text dt \\le\\frac{1}{x+\\sqrt{x^2+\\displaystyle\\tfrac{4}{\\pi}}}$$ for \\( x \\ge 0 \\).\n\nThe task is to format this into the Assumption and Problem sections. The example given in the user's query includes assumptions that list each condition. In the original problem, the main conditions are that \\( x \\ge 0 \\). However, I need to check if there are any other implicit assumptions. The integral here is from \\( x \\) to infinity of \\( e^{-t^2} dt \\), multiplied by \\( e^{x^2} \\). The functions involved here are defined for all real numbers, but the inequality is specified for \\( x \\ge 0 \\). \n\nSo, the key assumption here is that \\( x \\) is a real number greater than or equal to zero. The problem doesn't mention any other specific conditions or restrictions on other variables, as it's a single-variable inequality. \n\nTherefore, the assumptions should list that \\( x \\) is greater than or equal to 0. The problem statement is to prove the given inequality. \n\nWait, the example in the user's query had an assumption where they mentioned both that \\( n \\) is an integer and that \\( n \\) is divisible by 7. However, in the original problem here, the only condition given is \\( x \\ge 0 \\). There are no other explicit conditions mentioned. So, the assumption here is solely \\( x \\ge 0 \\).\n\nSo, structuring this, the Assumption section should have one line: \\( x \\) is greater than or equal to 0. Then the problem is to prove the inequality as stated.\n\nI need to make sure there are no other hidden assumptions. For example, the integral \\( \\int_x^\\infty e^{-t^2} dt \\) is well-defined for real \\( x \\), and multiplying by \\( e^{x^2} \\) is valid. Since the problem states \\( x \\ge 0 \\), that's the only condition to list. The functions involved don't have restrictions beyond that in the context of the problem.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n\\( x \\) is greater than or equal to 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\frac{1}{x+\\sqrt{x^2+2}}<e^{x^2}\\int\\limits_x^{\\infty}e^{-t^2} \\, \\text dt \\le\\frac{1}{x+\\sqrt{x^2+\\displaystyle\\tfrac{4}{\\pi}}}$$ for \\( x \\ge 0 \\).\n\nI think that's correct. The example had two assumptions, but in this case, there's only one. So no need to split into multiple unless there are multiple conditions. Here, it's just \\( x \\ge 0 \\).",
