    "Content": "If $a_n$ is a sequence such that $$a_1 \\leq a_2 \\leq a_3 \\leq \\dotsb$$ and has the property that $a_{n+1}-a_n \\to 0$ , then can we conclude that $a_n$ is convergent? I know that without the condition that the sequence is increasing, this is not true, as we could consider the sequence given in this answer to a similar question that does not require the sequence to be increasing. $$0, 1, \\frac12, 0, \\frac13, \\frac23, 1, \\frac34, \\frac12, \\frac14, 0, \\frac15, \\frac25, \\frac35, \\frac45, 1, \\dotsc$$ This oscillates between $0$ and $1$ , while the difference of consecutive terms approaches $0$ since the difference is always of the form $\\pm\\frac1m$ and $m$ increases the further we go in this sequence. So how can we use the condition that $a_n$ is increasing to show that $a_n$ must converge?  Or is this still not sufficient?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "No. Just consider the case in which $H_n=1+\\frac12+\\frac13+\\cdots+\\frac1n$ . Note that then we have $$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}H_{n+1}-H_n=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac1{n+1}=0.$$ But $H_n$ is the $n$ th partial sum of the harmonic series, and therefore $(H_n)_{n\\in\\Bbb N}$ diverges.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem properly. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format with Assumptions and Problem.\n\nFirst, I need to read the original problem carefully. The question is about whether an increasing sequence of reals converges if the difference between consecutive terms approaches zero. The user provided an example where without the increasing condition, the sequence doesn't converge, but they want to know if adding the increasing condition ensures convergence.\n\nLooking at the example the user gave for the divisibility problem, the Assumptions section lists each condition applied to one object. In the original problem here, the sequence is increasing, so that's one assumption. Then, the difference between consecutive terms approaching zero is another condition. The problem is to determine if these conditions lead to the conclusion that the sequence converges.\n\nWait, the original problem states that the sequence is increasing: a1 ≤ a2 ≤ a3 ≤ ... and that the difference a_{n+1} - a_n approaches 0. The user is asking if this implies convergence. So the assumptions are two: first, the sequence is monotonically increasing, and second, the limit of the differences between consecutive terms is zero. Each of these should be a separate line in the Assumption section. The problem is to determine if the sequence converges under these conditions.\n\nBut wait, in the example provided by the user, they had an assumption that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. Here, the two assumptions are about the sequence being increasing and the limit of the differences being zero. So each of these should be separate lines in the Assumptions.\n\nThe Problem part would then be the question: \"Prove or disprove that the sequence a_n is convergent.\"\n\nWait, the original question is phrased as \"can we conclude that a_n is convergent?\" So the problem is to determine whether the sequence must converge given those two assumptions. Therefore, the problem statement would be to prove or disprove the convergence.\n\nBut sometimes in these formats, if it's a known result, the problem might be to prove it. However, the user's example was to \"prove that A(n) is divisible by 91,\" so maybe here the answer is that yes, the sequence does converge, and the problem is to prove that. But the original question is phrased as a question—does it converge? So maybe the problem is to determine whether the conclusion holds, i.e., to prove or provide a counterexample. But in the example, the original question was \"Prove that...\", so perhaps the user wants to structure the problem as \"Prove or disprove that a_n converges.\"\n\nBut looking at the example, the original problem was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91,\" and the formatted problem kept that. So perhaps here, if the answer is known, the problem would be \"Prove that a_n converges.\" But the user's original question on Math Stack Exchange is asking whether it's true. So maybe the correct structure is to present it as \"Prove or disprove that a_n is convergent.\"\n\nWait, but in the example, the user filtered out the part where the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, no: looking back, the original problem in the example was \"Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, the original problem in the example says \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7.\" That seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect? Or perhaps there was a miscommunication.\n\nWait, the user provided their own example where they restructured a problem. Let me check again:\n\nOriginal problem in the example: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems inconsistent. The original problem states \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be a mistake. Because if n is any integer, then the assumption that n is divisible by 7 is an additional restriction. So perhaps the user made an error in their example. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a mistake, but according to the user's example, they added the assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nBut regardless, following the user's instruction, they want to extract the assumptions from the problem and list them line by line. So in the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\n1. The sequence a_n is increasing (a1 ≤ a2 ≤ a3 ≤ ...).\n\n2. The limit of (a_{n+1} - a_n) as n approaches infinity is 0.\n\nThese are the two conditions given. The problem is to determine if a_n converges.\n\nSo in the Assumption section, each of these would be a separate line. The Problem would be to prove or disprove that a_n converges.\n\nBut the user's example added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, perhaps the example was from a different problem where the original had an implicit assumption. Wait, maybe in the example, the user made a mistake. For instance, the original problem says \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7,\" which is incorrect. That suggests maybe the user's example is wrong, but I should follow their format regardless.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user's original question on Math Stack Exchange is: If a_n is increasing and the differences a_{n+1}-a_n tend to 0, does a_n converge?\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n- a_n is a sequence of real numbers.\n\n- a_n is increasing: a1 ≤ a2 ≤ a3 ≤ ...\n\n- The limit of (a_{n+1} - a_n) as n approaches infinity is 0.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that a_n converges.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions are listed without mentioning that they're about the same object. For example, in the example, the assumptions are \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by $7$\". Both apply to n.\n\nIn the current problem, the assumptions are about the sequence a_n: it is increasing, and the differences tend to zero. So each assumption is about the sequence a_n. Wait, but the example's assumptions were about n. So perhaps each assumption is a separate condition on the same object or different objects.\n\nWait, in the current problem, both assumptions are about the sequence a_n. But in the example, the assumptions are about n. So perhaps the formatting requires each assumption to be a separate condition, even if they apply to the same object.\n\nSo for the current problem:\n\nAssumption:\na_n is an increasing sequence (i.e., a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ a_3 ≤ ...),\nThe difference a_{n+1} - a_n approaches 0 as n approaches infinity.\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that a_n is convergent.\n\nBut the user's example wrote each assumption as a separate line. So:\n\nAssumption:\na_n is an increasing sequence,\nThe limit of (a_{n+1} - a_n) as n approaches infinity is 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that a_n is convergent.\n\nBut maybe the problem should be \"Prove that a_n is convergent\" if it's known to be true. However, the original question is asking whether it's true, so perhaps the problem is to determine that, hence \"Prove or disprove.\"\n\nBut in the example, the problem was to prove even though the original problem might have had a missing condition. But given the user's example, they restructured the problem by possibly adding an assumption (n divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem. That might have been a mistake, but perhaps the user intended to show that sometimes you need to extract implicit assumptions.\n\nIn any case, for the current problem, the two main assumptions are that the sequence is increasing and the differences tend to zero. The problem is to prove convergence.\n\nBut wait, the answer to this problem is that it's not necessarily convergent. Wait, no. Wait, in the case of an increasing sequence of real numbers, if it's bounded, then by the Monotone Convergence Theorem, it converges. If it's unbounded, it diverges to infinity. The condition that a_{n+1}-a_n tends to zero doesn't necessarily make it bounded. For example, consider the sequence a_n = sqrt(n). Then a_{n+1} - a_n = sqrt(n+1) - sqrt(n) = 1/(sqrt(n+1) + sqrt(n)) → 0 as n→∞. But a_n → ∞. Therefore, the sequence can be increasing, differences going to zero, but still diverge. Therefore, the conclusion is that the sequence does not necessarily converge. Hence, the answer is that it's not necessarily convergent, so the problem would be to \"Prove or disprove,\" and the answer would be a counterexample.\n\nBut the original question on Math Stack Exchange is asking whether we can conclude convergence given those two conditions. The user provides a counterexample when the sequence is not monotonic, but asks if with monotonicity, does it hold. The answer is no, as shown by the sqrt(n) example. Therefore, the problem is to determine if the statement is true, and the formatted problem would present the assumptions and the problem as to whether convergence follows.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption:\na_n is an increasing sequence,\nThe difference between consecutive terms a_{n+1} - a_n approaches 0 as n approaches infinity.\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that a_n is convergent.\n\nBut the example provided by the user in the initial message had a problem where they rephrased the original problem, possibly adding an incorrect assumption. However, following the user's instructions, we need to structure the problem by extracting the assumptions from the original question and presenting the problem.\n\nThe original question states the two conditions: increasing and differences approaching zero. The problem is to determine convergence. Hence, the formatted problem would list those two assumptions and ask to prove or disprove convergence.\n\nBut perhaps in the user's example, they made a mistake, but we need to follow the structure they demonstrated, which for the example had:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\nProblem: Prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut wait, that seems to add an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem. That must be a mistake. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n,\" which includes all integers, not just those divisible by 7. But the formatted problem adds that n is divisible by 7, which restricts it. This suggests that maybe the user's example is incorrect, but we should still follow their format as per their instruction.\n\nIn any case, returning to the current problem, the assumptions are the two conditions on the sequence, and the problem is to prove/disprove convergence. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\na_n is an increasing sequence,\nThe difference a_{n+1} - a_n approaches 0 as n approaches infinity.\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that a_n is convergent.\n\nAlternatively, if the answer is known (which in this case, it's disprove), but the format just requires stating the problem as is. Since the original question is asking whether it's true, the problem is to determine that, so \"Prove or disprove.\"\n\nBut the user's example didn't use \"prove or disprove\"; they had \"Prove that...\". However, in their example, the original problem was a statement to prove, whereas here the original problem is a question. So perhaps here the problem should be phrased as a question, but the user's format example used \"Prove that...\". However, the user's instruction says to structure the problem as in the example, which for the example turned \"Prove that for every integer n...\" into \"Prove that...\" with added assumptions. So perhaps here, despite the original question being \"can we conclude...\", the formatted problem should be \"Prove that a_n is convergent\" under the given assumptions, even if the answer is that it's false. But that seems incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's example is flawed, and we should present the problem accurately. Since the original question is asking whether it's true, the formatted problem should be \"Prove or disprove that a_n is convergent.\"\n\nBut the user's example took a problem that said \"Prove that for every integer n...\" and formatted it as \"Prove that...\" with added assumptions. So maybe the user wants to present the problem as a statement to prove, even if the original is a question. However, in this case, since the answer is that it's false, maybe the problem should be to \"Prove or disprove.\"\n\nBut given the user's example, they might expect just \"Prove that...\" even if the answer requires a disproof. However, since the user's instructions say to structure it based on the example, which for a true statement, we present it as \"Prove that...\".\n\nBut in reality, the correct answer is that the statement is false, so the problem should be to disprove it, but the original question is asking whether it's true. So perhaps the formatted problem should be \"Prove or disprove that a_n is convergent.\"\n\nBut since the user's example didn't include \"prove or disprove,\" but instead took a prove statement, maybe they expect to frame it as a prove statement even if it's incorrect. But that would be misleading. However, following the user's example strictly, even if it's incorrect, perhaps we should format it as \"Prove that...\" But I think that would be wrong in this case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's example had a mistake, and they actually intended to have the assumptions listed correctly. For example, in the original problem, maybe the user intended to have the problem be to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 when n is an integer divisible by 7, but the original problem stated \"for every integer n,\" which might not be true unless n is divisible by 7. So perhaps the user corrected the problem by adding the necessary assumption.\n\nIn that case, the example is correct: the original problem was incorrect as stated, and the formatted problem includes the necessary assumption that n is divisible by 7 for the divisibility by 91 (since 91=7*13, so likely the expression is divisible by 7 and 13 when n is divisible by 6 or something). But regardless, the user's example added an assumption to make the problem correct.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question is whether an increasing sequence with differences tending to zero converges. The answer is no, as the example of a_n = sqrt(n) shows. Therefore, to structure this problem correctly, the assumptions are the two conditions, and the problem is to prove or disprove convergence. Therefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\na_n is an increasing sequence,\nThe limit of (a_{n+1} - a_n) as n approaches infinity is 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that a_n is convergent.\n\nBut given that the answer is to disprove by providing a counterexample, but the format requires stating the problem as is.\n\nYes, that's the accurate way. The user's question is asking whether the conclusion holds, so the problem is to determine that, hence \"Prove or disprove.\"",
