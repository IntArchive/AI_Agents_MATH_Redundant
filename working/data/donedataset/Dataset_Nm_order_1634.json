    "Content": "I have the following problem: Show that 9 consecutive integers cannot be partitioned into two sets such that the products of the first and second set are equal. I know this question has been asked multiple times. Nearly all of the answers argue with prime factorization and I was just wondering where the flaw in my argumentation is: Suppose such a partition exists. Then the product of the 9 consecutive integers needs to be a perfect square $n^2$ . The product can also be represented as $k(k+1)\\dots{}(k+8)$ which when multiplied out yields a polynomial of the form $$\nk^9 + \\text{polynomial of degree} \\leq 8.\n$$ In order for this to be a perfect square, we would need to be able to represent the polynomial in the form $(\\dots{})^2$ . Since the degree of the polynomial is odd, we cannot do this and hence such a partition does not exist. Edit : I know that there is a theorem (Erdos-Selfridge) that states the product of consecutive integers can never be a perfect power $x^l$ . However, I was wondering if my argument about the even/odd property for this special case holds.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Consider two distinct questions about polynomials: Can a polynomial of odd degree be a square of another polynomial? Can a polynomial of odd degree take a value which is a square? Your attempted proof depends on a negative answer to (2), but in fact (2) is true, for example $k^9+k^4+1$ is of odd degree, but when $k=2$ takes the value $529=23^2$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions and then clearly state the problem.\n\nThe original problem is about showing that 9 consecutive integers cannot be partitioned into two sets with equal products. The user's attempted proof argues that the product of these 9 numbers must be a perfect square, but since the polynomial expansion has an odd degree (9), it can't be a square. The question is asking where the flaw in this reasoning is, especially considering the Erdos-Selfridge theorem which already states that the product of consecutive integers isn't a perfect power.\n\nFirst, I need to list all assumptions from the problem. The key points are:\n\n1. The problem involves 9 consecutive integers.\n2. These integers are partitioned into two sets.\n3. The products of the two sets are equal.\n4. If such a partition exists, the product of all 9 numbers would be a perfect square (since each element's product in the sets would multiply to the same number, so the product squared equals the product of all 9 numbers).\n5. The product of 9 consecutive numbers is expressed as k(k+1)...(k+8), which is a polynomial of degree 9 when expanded.\n6. The user assumes that a polynomial of odd degree cannot be a perfect square because a square polynomial has even degree.\n\nWait, but the problem is pointing out the flaw in this argument. So the assumptions include the user's reasoning steps. However, the task is to structure the original problem as per the format, not the user's reasoning. Wait, let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example provided, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91. The user had an original problem where n was an integer, and the formatted assumptions included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So in the example, the original problem's assumptions are listed.\n\nIn this case, the problem is to show that 9 consecutive integers cannot be partitioned into two sets with equal product. The user's approach made certain assumptions, but the task is to structure the problem as per the given format, not the user's reasoning. Wait, the user's question is about their own argument, but the problem to be formatted is the original problem they are trying to solve, not their reasoning.\n\nWait, the original problem is: \"Show that 9 consecutive integers cannot be partitioned into two sets such that the products of the first and second set are equal.\" The user's approach is their flawed proof. The formatted problem should capture the original problem's assumptions and statement, not the user's reasoning. However, the user's question is asking about the flaw in their argument, so maybe the problem part should reflect their approach's assumptions?\n\nHmm, the example given by the user includes the original problem's assumptions. For instance, in the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, leading to the problem statement. But in the current case, the problem is to show that 9 consecutive integers can't be partitioned. The user's own assumptions in their flawed proof include that if such a partition exists, then the product must be a perfect square. But the problem as posed doesn't have that as an assumption; that's part of the user's reasoning.\n\nWait, the task is to \"structure that problem as the following format\", which refers to the original problem, not the user's reasoning. The user's question is about their own argument, but the problem to structure is the problem they are trying to solve. Let me re-read the instructions.\n\nThe user says: \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" So the input is the Math Stack Exchange question, which includes the original problem and the user's reasoning. The task is to extract the original problem and structure it with assumptions and problem statement.\n\nThe original problem is: \"Show that 9 consecutive integers cannot be partitioned into two sets such that the products of the first and second set are equal.\" The assumptions here would be:\n\n- There are 9 consecutive integers.\n- They are partitioned into two sets.\n- The products of the two sets are equal.\n\nBut the user's own argument introduces another assumption: that the product of all 9 numbers is a perfect square. However, this is part of their reasoning, not the original problem's assumption.\n\nWait, the example given had the original problem with an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So perhaps the assumptions should include all the given conditions. Let me think. The original problem says \"Show that 9 consecutive integers cannot be partitioned into two sets such that...\" So the assumptions here are:\n\n1. The numbers are 9 consecutive integers.\n2. They are partitioned into two sets.\n3. The products of the two sets are equal.\n\nBut the problem is to show that such a partition is impossible. However, in the example, assumptions were about the variables in the problem. Maybe the key here is to list the mathematical conditions given in the problem.\n\nBut the problem as stated doesn't have explicit assumptions beyond the 9 consecutive integers and the partition. The user's approach adds that the product must be a perfect square, but that's part of their proof attempt.\n\nWait, perhaps the original problem's assumptions are just the 9 consecutive integers. The rest is part of the problem statement. The example's original problem had \"for every integer n\", which was listed as an assumption. So here, the original problem's assumption is that we have 9 consecutive integers, and the problem is to show they can't be partitioned into two sets with equal product.\n\nBut in the example, the formatted problem included both the general assumption (n is an integer) and a specific one (n is divisible by 7). Wait, the original example had the problem to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem listed two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem in the example was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. However, the formatted problem in the example had assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, leading to the problem statement. Wait, that seems inconsistent. Wait, let me check again:\n\nThe original example problem says: Prove that for every integer $n$, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nThe formatted problem lists assumptions as: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that suggests that the formatted problem actually changed the original problem's assumptions. Because the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Unless there was a mistake in the example.\n\nWait, perhaps the example is incorrect. But since the user provided that example, I need to follow their structure. So perhaps the task is to list all the assumptions inherent in the problem, even if they are not explicitly stated but necessary for the problem to hold.\n\nWait, no. The original problem in the example was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Unless the original problem had a typo or was misstated. Alternatively, perhaps the example is illustrative but not accurate. Given that, perhaps the user expects that assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. For example, in the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- The numbers are 9 consecutive integers.\n- They can be partitioned into two sets.\n- The products of the sets are equal.\n\nBut the problem is to show that this is impossible. However, the way the example was structured, the assumptions were properties of the variables in the problem. In the example, n is an integer (given) and n is divisible by 7 (maybe a condition needed for the divisibility by 91? Since 91=13*7, so if n is divisible by 7, then 5^n is divisible by 7, etc. But the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which would include n not divisible by 7. So perhaps the example is wrong, but the user provided it, so I need to follow the user's structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example is correct, and the original problem had an implicit assumption that n is divisible by 7, which the user included. But the original problem statement in the example doesn't mention that. This is confusing. Maybe the example is flawed, but I have to proceed as per the user's instruction.\n\nIn the current problem, the original problem is to show that 9 consecutive integers cannot be partitioned into two sets with equal product. The user's approach assumes that if such a partition exists, the product of all 9 numbers must be a perfect square. But this is part of their reasoning, not the original problem's assumption.\n\nTherefore, when structuring the problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. The numbers are 9 consecutive integers.\n2. They are partitioned into two sets.\n3. The products of the two sets are equal.\n\nBut the problem is to show that this is impossible. However, the example seems to have taken some conditions from the problem and additional ones. Alternatively, maybe the problem's assumptions are only the 9 consecutive integers, and the rest is part of the problem statement.\n\nBut the user's example included both the general condition (n is an integer) and a specific one (n divisible by 7). So perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- There exists a set of 9 consecutive integers.\n- They can be partitioned into two subsets.\n- The products of the two subsets are equal.\n\nBut the problem is to show that this is impossible, so maybe the assumptions are the hypothetical scenario where such a partition exists, and the problem is to show a contradiction.\n\nWait, the problem is to prove that such a partition cannot exist. So the assumptions would be the conditions that would need to hold if such a partition existed, which are:\n\n- There is a set of 9 consecutive integers.\n- They are partitioned into two sets.\n- The products of these two sets are equal.\n\nTherefore, the problem is to show that these assumptions lead to a contradiction, i.e., such a partition cannot exist.\n\nBut the user's own argument adds an assumption that the product of all 9 numbers is a perfect square. However, this is derived from the initial assumptions (if two subsets have equal product, then their product is equal to the square of each subset's product, so the total product is a square). Therefore, this is a consequence, not an assumption. Thus, perhaps the formatted problem should not include this as an assumption.\n\nBut according to the example, the user included assumptions that may not be explicitly stated but are necessary. For instance, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem included an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect unless the original problem was misstated. But perhaps in the example, the user intended to structure a problem where n is divisible by 7, which would make the divisibility by 91 easier (since 7 and 13 are factors). However, the original problem in the example was stated as \"for every integer n\", which contradicts the formatted assumption. So maybe the example is incorrect, but we have to follow the user's structure regardless.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the safest way is to list the explicit assumptions given in the original problem. The original problem states: \"Show that 9 consecutive integers cannot be partitioned into two sets such that the products of the first and second set are equal.\"\n\nThus, the assumptions would be:\n\n- There are 9 consecutive integers.\n- They are partitioned into two sets.\n- The products of the two sets are equal.\n\nThe problem is to show that this is impossible. However, in the example, the assumptions included both the variable's nature (n is an integer) and a condition (n divisible by 7). Here, the assumptions are the conditions required for the problem to hold. But since the problem is to show impossibility, the assumptions would be the hypothetical scenario where such a partition exists, leading to a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's only assumption is that the numbers are 9 consecutive integers, and the problem is to prove that they cannot be partitioned into two sets with equal products. Therefore, the assumptions line would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe numbers are 9 consecutive integers.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the numbers cannot be partitioned into two sets with equal products.\n\nBut the user's example included multiple assumptions. Let's compare with the example:\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which includes all integers, not just those divisible by 7. So the formatted problem in the example seems to have added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7, which changes the original problem. This suggests that perhaps the user wants to extract implicit assumptions from the problem or correct the problem's conditions. But that seems risky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example is a mistake, and the user intended to format the problem with the correct assumptions. If the original problem had said \"Prove that for every integer n divisible by 7, A(n) is divisible by 91\", then the formatted assumptions would be correct. But the original problem as stated in the example is more general. Therefore, perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user wants us to follow the structure regardless.\n\nIn the current problem, the original problem is to show that 9 consecutive numbers can't be partitioned into two sets with equal product. The user's argument introduces the assumption that the product must be a perfect square, but this is a consequence of the partition existing. So perhaps the formatted problem should include:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The numbers are 9 consecutive integers.\n- They are partitioned into two sets with equal products.\n\nProblem:\nShow that this leads to a contradiction (i.e., such a partition is impossible).\n\nBut the example's problem statement didn't include the contradiction part; it just stated the problem. So perhaps the problem statement is simply \"Prove that 9 consecutive integers cannot be partitioned into two sets such that the products of the first and second set are equal.\"\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions should list the conditions applied to the objects. In the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the objects are the 9 consecutive integers and the partition. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe numbers are 9 consecutive integers,\nThe numbers are partitioned into two sets,\nThe products of the two sets are equal.\n\nProblem:\nShow that such a partition is impossible.\n\nBut in the example, the problem statement was to prove divisibility by 91 under the assumptions. Here, the problem is to show impossibility under the assumptions. However, the way the example is structured, the problem statement is the original problem, with the assumptions being the conditions given. But since the original problem is to show impossibility, the assumptions would be the conditions that would need to hold for the partition to exist, leading to a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions are only the inherent conditions (9 consecutive integers), and the problem is to prove they can't be partitioned. But according to the example, the assumptions can include multiple conditions. Given this confusion, I think the best approach is to list the explicit assumptions from the problem statement:\n\nAssumption:\nThere are 9 consecutive integers,\nThese integers are partitioned into two sets,\nThe products of the two sets are equal.\n\nProblem:\nShow that this is impossible.\n\nBut the problem statement in the example retained the original wording. For example, in the example, the problem was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" under the assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Similarly, here, the problem would be \"Prove that 9 consecutive integers cannot be partitioned into two sets such that the products of the first and second set are equal,\" with assumptions being the necessary conditions.\n\nHowever, the user's own argument introduces the assumption that the product is a perfect square. But that's part of their reasoning, not the original problem's conditions. Therefore, it shouldn't be listed as an assumption in the formatted problem. The original problem's assumptions are just the 9 consecutive integers and the partition with equal products.\n\nBut the example included an assumption beyond the original problem's statement (n divisible by 7), which might indicate that the user wants to include necessary conditions derived from the problem's solution. However, that seems incorrect. Maybe the example was a mistake.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I think the correct approach is to structure the problem as:\n\nAssumption:\nThe numbers are 9 consecutive integers.\n\nProblem:\nProve that they cannot be partitioned into two sets with equal products.\n\nBut according to the example, perhaps more detailed assumptions are needed. Let's look again at the example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nThis seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n,\" which includes all integers, not just those divisible by 7. The formatted problem here restricts n to be divisible by 7, which changes the original problem. Therefore, the example might have an error, but the user provided it, so we have to follow their structure.\n\nIn that case, for the current problem, perhaps the assumptions include not only the 9 consecutive integers but also that their product is a perfect square, as per the user's argument. However, that is part of the user's reasoning, not the original problem's conditions. The original problem doesn't mention perfect squares; that's the user's approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are the conditions required for the user's argument to hold. But the task is to structure the original problem, not the user's argument. The user's question is about their own argument's flaw, but the problem to structure is the original problem they were trying to solve.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe numbers are 9 consecutive integers.\n\nProblem:\nProve that they cannot be partitioned into two sets such that the products of the first and second set are equal.\n\nThis aligns with the original problem statement. The example might have included additional assumptions due to a mistake, but following the user's instruction, we should list the assumptions inherent in the problem. The original problem's only assumption is that there are 9 consecutive integers. The rest is part of the problem statement (partitioning into two sets with equal products).\n\nHowever, the example included multiple assumptions, even if they weren't all explicitly stated. If we follow that pattern, perhaps the assumptions here are:\n\nAssumption:\nThe numbers are 9 consecutive integers,\nThe numbers are partitioned into two sets,\nThe products of the two sets are equal.\n\nProblem:\nShow that such a partition is impossible.\n\nBut the problem statement in the example retained the original wording. The example's problem statement was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" under the assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Similarly, here, the problem statement would be \"Prove that such a partition is impossible\" under the assumptions that there are 9 consecutive integers partitioned into two sets with equal products. However, the original problem is to show that this cannot happen, so the assumptions are the hypothetical scenario where it does happen, leading to a contradiction. But the way the example is structured, the assumptions are the given conditions for the problem.\n\nGiven the confusion and the example provided, I think the correct formatted problem according to the user's example would list the assumptions as the conditions given in the problem. Since the original problem is to show that partitioning 9 consecutive integers into two sets with equal products is impossible, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe numbers are 9 consecutive integers.\n\nProblem:\nProve that they cannot be partitioned into two sets such that the products of the first and second set are equal.\n\nThis matches the original problem statement without adding extra assumptions from the user's reasoning. The user's argument about the perfect square is part of their proof attempt, not the problem's assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nThe numbers are 9 consecutive integers.\nProblem:\nProve that they cannot be partitioned into two sets such that the products of the first and second set are equal.\n###",
