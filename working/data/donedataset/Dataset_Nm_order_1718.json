    "AcceptedAnswer": "We may exploit:\n$$ F_{2n+1}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n}\\binom{n+k}{n-k}x^{2k}\\tag{1} $$\nwhere $F_n(x)$ is a Fibonacci polynomial . That gives: $$\\sum_{k=0}^{n}\\binom{n+k}{n-k}\\frac{(-1)^{n+k}}{2k+1}=(-1)^n\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{\\alpha(x)^{2n+1}-\\beta(x)^{2n+1}}{\\alpha(x)-\\beta(x)}\\,dx,\\tag{2}$$\nwhere:\n$$ \\alpha(x) = \\frac{ix+\\sqrt{4-x^2}}{2},\\qquad \\beta(x) = \\frac{ix-\\sqrt{4-x^2}}{2},\\tag{3}$$\nso we just need to use the substitution $x=2\\sin\\theta$ in the RHS of $(2)$ to prove our claim, since the RHS of $(2)$ is so converted into:\n$$ 2(-1)^n \\int_{0}^{\\frac{\\pi}{6}}\\cos((2n+1)\\theta)\\,d\\theta.\\tag{4}$$\nAs pointed by r9m, the same can be achieved by using Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind in the first place.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me first read through the problem carefully.\n\nThe user provided an example where they extracted assumptions and the problem statement. The key is to list each assumption on a separate line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object.\n\nLooking at the problem here: the sum from k=0 to n of [(-1)^(n+k) * binomial(n+k, n-k) / (2k+1)] equals -2/(2n+1) * cos(2(n-1)π/3). The user wants to prove this identity and is asking for an interesting proof, mentioning they have a proof by induction but it's not simple.\n\nNow, the assumptions. The example included conditions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, I need to check if there are any explicit or implicit conditions on n in the original problem. The summation is from k=0 to n, and the binomial coefficient suggests n is a non-negative integer. Also, the cosine term might have periodicity, but unless specified, n could be any integer. However, binomial coefficients with negative integers might complicate things, but in the problem statement, since the upper limit is n, it's implied that n is a non-negative integer. So the assumptions would be that n is a non-negative integer. Are there any other conditions? The problem doesn't mention divisibility or other constraints, so the main assumption is that n is a non-negative integer.\n\nWait, the original problem's title and question don't specify any restrictions on n, but the summation from k=0 to n implies n is an integer >=0. So that's the key assumption here. The problem is to prove the equality holds for all non-negative integers n.\n\nSo structuring that:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a non-negative integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n+k}{n-k}\\frac{(-1)^{n+k}}{2k+1}=-\\frac{2}{2n+1}\\,\\cos\\left(\\frac{2(n-1)\\pi}{3}\\right).$$\n\nI need to check if there are any other assumptions. The user mentioned they have an inductive proof, so maybe the original problem assumes n is an integer, but the key here is to filter only the necessary assumptions from the problem as presented. The problem statement itself doesn't specify any restrictions beyond what's implied by the summation and binomial coefficients. Therefore, the main assumption is that n is a non-negative integer. That's it. So the formatted problem should list that as the assumption and then the problem statement.",
