    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here is LaTex-ed version of the proof posted in BBred's comment . \nI've tried to add details of one place of the proof. If the OP explains which part of the proof is the problem, perhaps that part can be explained in more detail. I've made this answer a CW - anyone, feel free to contribute. Certainly the set $HK$ has $|H||K|$ symbols.\n  However,not all symbols need represent distinct group elements. That is, we may have $hk=h'k'$ although $h\\ne h'$ and $k\\ne k'$.\n  We must determine the extent to which this happens. For every $t\\in H\\cap K$, $hk =(ht)(t^{-1} k)$, so each group element in $HK$ is represented by at least $|H\\cap K|$ products in $HK$. But $hk = h'k'$ implies $t = h^{-1} h' = k(k')^{-1}\\in H\\cap K$ so that $h'=ht$ and $k' = t^{-1} k$. Thus each element in $HK$ is represented by exactly $|H\\cap K|$ products. So, $$|HK|= \\frac{|H||K|}{|H\\cap K|}.$$ If we have $hk=h'k'$ and we multiply this by $h^{-1}$ from left and by ${k'}^{-1}$ from right, we get $$k{k'}^{-1}=h^{-1}h.$$ \nMaybe it should be stressed that $t\\in H$, since $t=h^{-1}h'$; and $t\\in K$ since $t=k{k'}^{-1}$. (Which means $t\\in H\\cap K$.)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, we need to prove that the order of the product of two subgroups H and K in a group G is equal to (order of H times order of K) divided by the order of their intersection. The formula given is o(HK) = o(H)o(K)/o(H∩K). \n\nFirst, I remember that in group theory, when dealing with products of subgroups, the product set HK is not always a subgroup unless one of them is normal in G. But here, the problem doesn't specify that H or K is normal, so HK might just be a subset of G, not necessarily a subgroup. But the question is about the order of HK, which refers to the number of elements in the set HK, regardless of whether it's a subgroup or not.\n\nNow, the formula resembles the formula for the order of the product in the case of finite groups. I recall that when H and K are finite subgroups of G, then the order of HK is given by |HK| = |H||K| / |H∩K|. But I need to verify the conditions under which this holds. The key point here is that H and K must be finite, and their product HK is a set whose size can be calculated using this formula.\n\nWait, but does the original problem state that G is finite? Let me check the original question again. The user wrote: \"Let H, K be subgroups of G. Prove that o(HK) = o(H)o(K)/o(H∩K).\" The term \"o\" here probably stands for the order. But the problem doesn't explicitly say that G is finite. However, if H and K are subgroups of G, their orders must divide the order of G if G is finite. But if G is infinite, then H and K could be infinite as well. However, the formula involves dividing by the order of H∩K, which would require that H∩K is finite if H and K are infinite. But the formula as stated would not make sense if, say, H and K are infinite but H∩K is trivial (order 1), because then the formula would suggest |HK| = |H||K|, which for infinite sets isn't a cardinal number in standard set theory. So, likely, the problem assumes that all the groups involved are finite. That must be an implicit assumption here.\n\nSo, the first assumption would be that G is a finite group. Then, H and K are subgroups of G, hence they are also finite. Their intersection H∩K is also a subgroup of both H and K, so it's finite as well. Therefore, the formula applies in the context of finite group theory.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the product HK is being considered as a set. That is, HK = {hk | h ∈ H, k ∈ K}. The order of HK is the number of distinct elements in this set. The formula counts the number of such elements by considering that each element in HK can be written in multiple ways as hk, specifically, the number of such representations is |H∩K|. Hence, the total number of pairs (h,k) in H×K is |H||K|, but each element in HK is counted |H∩K| times, so dividing by |H∩K| gives the correct count. This is similar to the principle used in counting cosets or orbits in group actions.\n\nBut to make sure this reasoning holds, we need to confirm that each element in HK is expressed uniquely up to the intersection. That is, if hk = h'k', then h'^{-1}h = k'k^{-1} must be in H∩K. So, the number of distinct elements in HK is |H||K| divided by |H∩K|. This seems to be the standard argument for this formula. Therefore, the key assumptions are that H and K are finite subgroups of G, and their intersection is also finite. But since H and K are subgroups of G, if G is finite, then all these are automatically satisfied. So, the main assumption is that G is a finite group, and H, K are its subgroups.\n\nTherefore, the structured problem should list these assumptions. Let me check the example given in the user's instruction. In the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Each assumption is a single property applied to one object. So, for this problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. G is a finite group.\n2. H is a subgroup of G.\n3. K is a subgroup of G.\n\nBut wait, the problem states \"Let H, K be subgroups of G,\" so maybe the fact that they are subgroups is part of the problem statement. However, the user's example included in the assumption things that were part of the problem statement. In the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n,\" but in the formatted problem, it's listed as an assumption. So, following that pattern, even though the problem says \"Let H, K be subgroups of G,\" those would be translated into assumptions. \n\nSo, each assumption line should be:\n\n- H is a subgroup of G.\n- K is a subgroup of G.\n- G is a finite group.\n\nBut does the formula require G to be finite? If H and K are finite, even if G is infinite, then the formula would still hold as long as H and K are finite. So, perhaps the necessary assumptions are that H and K are finite subgroups of G. Because if H and K are finite, their intersection is also finite, and the formula |HK| = |H||K| / |H∩K| would still hold, regardless of G being infinite. But in the original problem statement, the user didn't specify whether G is finite. However, in standard group theory, when talking about orders of elements or subgroups, unless specified otherwise, it's often assumed the group is finite, especially when dealing with formulas involving division like this. \n\nBut to be precise, the formula requires H and K to be finite. So, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- H is a finite subgroup of G.\n- K is a finite subgroup of G.\n\nBut since H and K are subgroups of G, if G is finite, they are automatically finite. However, if G is infinite, H and K could still be finite. So, to make the formula valid, H and K need to be finite. Therefore, the key assumption is that H and K are finite. Therefore, the problem's assumptions should list H and K as finite subgroups. However, the original problem statement just says \"Let H, K be subgroups of G.\" So, perhaps the user needs to include that H and K are finite. But in the problem statement as given on Math Stack Exchange, the user wrote: \"Prove that o(HK) = o(H)o(K)/o(H∩K).\" The notation o(HK) implies that HK has a finite order, hence H and K must be finite. Therefore, the assumptions are that H and K are finite subgroups of G. So, each of these should be listed as separate assumptions. \n\nSo, breaking it down:\n\nAssumption:\n- H is a subgroup of G.\n- K is a subgroup of G.\n- H is finite.\n- K is finite.\n\nBut the problem statement already mentions H and K as subgroups, so perhaps \"H is a subgroup of G\" and \"K is a subgroup of G\" are part of the problem's given, so they should be listed as assumptions. Then, to apply the formula, H and K must be finite. But the problem statement uses \"o(HK)\", which implies HK is finite, so that requires H and K to be finite. So, perhaps the key assumptions here are that H and K are finite. But since H and K are subgroups, the parent group G may or may not be finite, but H and K must be finite for their orders to be defined. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- H is a finite subgroup of G.\n- K is a finite subgroup of G.\n\nBut to split them into one condition per line, each applied to one object, as per the user's instruction, we can write:\n\nAssumption:\nH is a subgroup of G,\nK is a subgroup of G,\nH is finite,\nK is finite.\n\nBut maybe even the intersection H∩K is finite. However, since H and K are finite, their intersection is automatically finite. So, perhaps that's redundant. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might be that in the original problem statement, the user might have forgotten to specify that the group is finite or that H and K are finite. But the theorem as stated is standard for finite groups. Therefore, to structure the problem correctly, the assumptions should include that H and K are finite. \n\nBut let me check the example given by the user. In their example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91. The user structured it with assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem was \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. However, that seems like an error. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in their example? Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem in the example: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1 ) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\"\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which would mean n is any integer. But in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which is not in the original problem. That seems like a mistake. Wait, perhaps the user intended to provide an example where they filtered out some unrelated information, but maybe that example isn't correctly formatted. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a typo, and the user corrected it. However, in the example, the formatted problem includes \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which wasn't in the original problem. That seems incorrect. \n\nBut since the user provided that example as a reference, perhaps we need to follow that structure. The user's instruction says: \"filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" So perhaps in the example, the original problem had some extra information that was filtered, and the assumption that n is divisible by 7 was part of the actual problem's conditions. Maybe there was a miscommunication in the example. \n\nBut regardless, following the user's instructions, when structuring the problem, we need to list all assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. \n\nSo, returning to the current problem: \"Prove that o(HK) = o(H)o(K)/o(H∩K)\". The standard theorem for finite groups states that if H and K are subgroups of a group G, then |HK| = |H||K| / |H∩K|. Therefore, the necessary assumptions are that H and K are finite subgroups of G. Therefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n- H is a subgroup of G.\n- K is a subgroup of G.\n- H is finite.\n- K is finite.\n\nBut since being a subgroup is part of the problem's premise, they should be listed as assumptions. The finiteness is required for the formula to make sense. Therefore, the structured problem would have these four assumptions. However, in practice, when H and K are subgroups of G, and their orders are considered, it's often implicit that they are finite. But to be precise, we should list the finiteness as separate assumptions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that in the original problem, the user wrote \"theorem to prove something\", but the key assumptions are that H and K are subgroups with finite orders, hence the group is finite. However, in the problem statement, the user didn't specify whether G is finite. So, to be safe, the assumptions should include that H and K are finite. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nH is a subgroup of G,\nK is a subgroup of G,\nH is finite,\nK is finite.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $o(HK) = \\frac{o(H)o(K)}{o(H \\cap K)}$.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that \"H and K are subgroups of G\" is part of the problem's statement, and the key assumptions are their finiteness, but in the user's example, they included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, which was part of the original problem's quantifier. So perhaps in this case, since the problem says \"Let H, K be subgroups of G\", that would translate to the assumptions \"H is a subgroup of G\" and \"K is a subgroup of G\". Then, since we need their orders to be finite, the additional assumptions are that H and K are finite. However, the original problem didn't state that H and K are finite, but since they use o(H), o(K), etc., it's implied that they are finite. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- H is a subgroup of G.\n- K is a subgroup of G.\n- H is finite.\n- K is finite.\n\nBut in the problem statement, it's given that H and K are subgroups, so the first two assumptions are part of the problem's premise, and the next two are necessary for the formula to hold. Hence, the formatted problem includes all four assumptions.\n\nSo, to comply with the user's example, where the original problem said \"for every integer n\", and the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, similarly here, \"Let H, K be subgroups of G\" becomes \"H is a subgroup of G\", \"K is a subgroup of G\", and the necessary assumptions of finiteness are added. Therefore, the final answer should list all these.",
