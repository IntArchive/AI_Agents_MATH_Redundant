    "Content": "I've been struggling to prove this fact over the past day or so. Suppose $f(x)\\in F[X]$ is irreducible over a field $F$ with $\\deg(f)=n$, and let $L$ be the splitting field of $f(x)$ over $F$ with $\\alpha$ a root of $f(x)$ in $L$. Let $K/F$ be a Galois extension, with $K\\subset L$. Then why does $f(x)$ split into a product of $m$ irreducible polynomials of degree $d$ over $K$, with $m=[F(\\alpha)\\cap K:F]$ and $d=[K(\\alpha):K]$? If $G$ is the Galois group of $L/F$, then I let $H$ be the corresponding subgroup of $K$, which is normal since $K/F$ is Galois. I know $H$ permutes the roots of $f(x)$, specifically fixing the roots of $f(x)$ in $K$. I know some basic equalities like $[F(\\alpha):F]=n$, and $[K:F]=|G:H|$, but I'm not seeing how to start a good argument. What's a good way to prove this, or at least proceed? Thank you for any insight.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Factor $f(x)$ into irreducibles in $K[x]$,\n$$f(x) = q_1(x)\\cdots q_m(x).$$ If $\\alpha$ is a root of $q_1(x)$ and $\\beta$ is a root of $q_i(x)$, then $q_1(x)$ is the irreducible polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $K$, and $q_i(x)$ is the irreducible polynomial of $\\beta$ over $K$. Since the action of $G$ is transitive on the roots of $f$ there exists $\\sigma\\in G$ such that $\\sigma(\\alpha)=\\beta$. Since $K$ is Galois, $\\sigma(K)=K$, so $\\sigma(q_1(x))\\in K[x]$ is a polynomial that has $\\sigma(\\alpha)=\\beta$ as a root. Therefore, $q_i(x)|\\sigma(q_1(x))$. Since both are irreducible, it follows that $\\deg(q_i) = \\deg(\\sigma(q_1))=\\deg(q_1)$. So all irreducible factors of $f(x)$ in $K$ have the same degree. The degree is equal to the degree of the extension $K(\\alpha)/K$ (which is the degree of $q_1(x)$). A for $m$, the number of factors, we have:\n$n=[F(\\alpha):F] = [F(\\alpha):F(\\alpha)\\cap K][F(\\alpha)\\cap K:F]$. I claim that $[F(\\alpha):F(\\alpha)\\cap K] = [K(\\alpha):K]$. Indeed, since $K$ is Galois over $F$, then $K(\\alpha)$ is Galois over $F(\\alpha)$ ($K$ is the splitting field of some polynomial over $F$, and this same polynomial works for $K(\\alpha)$), and $K$ is Galois over $K\\cap F(\\alpha)$. If $\\sigma\\in\\mathrm{Gal}(K(\\alpha)/F(\\alpha))$, then restricting $\\sigma$ to $K$ gives a homomorphism $\\mathrm{Gal}(K(\\alpha)/F(\\alpha))\\to \\mathrm{Gal}(K/K\\cap F(\\alpha))$. If $\\sigma$ restricts to the identity on $K$, then it must be the identity on $K(\\alpha)$ (it fixes $\\alpha$ since it fixes $F(\\alpha)$ pointwise), so the map $\\mathrm{Gal}(K(\\alpha)/F(\\alpha))\\to \\mathrm{Gal}(K/K\\cap F(\\alpha))$ is one-to-one. Let $H'$ be the image of this map. Then $H'$ fixes $K\\cap F(\\alpha)$ pointwise, and if $k\\in K$ is fixed by all elements of $H'$, then $k$ must be fixed by all elements of $\\mathrm{Gal}(K(\\alpha)/F(\\alpha))$, hence $k\\in F(\\alpha)\\cap K$. So $F(\\alpha)\\cap K$ is the fixed field of $H'$, hence $H'=\\mathrm{Gal}(K/K\\cap F(\\alpha))$. Thus, $[K(\\alpha):F(\\alpha)] = [K:K\\cap F(\\alpha)]$. Now, \n$$\\begin{align*}\n[K(\\alpha):K\\cap F(\\alpha)] &= [K(\\alpha):K][K:K\\cap F(\\alpha)]\\\\\n\\text{ and }[K(\\alpha):K\\cap F(\\alpha)] &= [K(\\alpha):F(\\alpha)][F(\\alpha):K\\cap F(\\alpha)].\\end{align*}$$ \nTherefore, $[K(\\alpha):K] = [F(\\alpha):K\\cap F(\\alpha)]$, as claimed. So we have that\n$$\\begin{align*}\nn &= [F(\\alpha):F]= [F(\\alpha):F(\\alpha)\\cap K][F(\\alpha)\\cap K:F]\\\\\n &= [K(\\alpha):K][F(\\alpha)\\cap K:F] \\\\\n&= d[F(\\alpha)\\cap K:F].\n\\end{align*}$$ \nSince $n=dm$, then\n$$m = [F(\\alpha)\\cap K:F],$$\nas claimed. To see the action of $G$ is transitive, note that $F(\\alpha)$ is isomorphic to $F(\\beta)$ over $F$, since $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ have the same irreducible over $F$; hence there is an isomorphism $\\sigma\\colon F(\\alpha)\\to F(\\beta)$ that restricts to the identity on $F$ and sends $\\alpha$ to $\\beta$. Since $L$ is Galois over $F$, and $F(\\alpha),F(\\beta)\\subseteq L$, $\\sigma$ extends to an element of $G$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem correctly. The original question is about proving that an irreducible polynomial splits into irreducible factors of equal degree over a Galois extension. The user mentioned several components: the polynomial f(x) is irreducible over F with degree n, L is the splitting field of f over F, α is a root, K/F is a Galois extension inside L. They want to show f splits into m irreducible factors of degree d over K, where m is [F(α) ∩ K : F] and d is [K(α) : K].\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. Let's parse through the problem step by step.\n\n1. The polynomial f(x) is in F[X] and is irreducible over F. So assumption: f is irreducible over F.\n2. The degree of f is n. Assumption: deg(f) = n.\n3. L is the splitting field of f over F. Assumption: L is the splitting field of f over F.\n4. α is a root of f in L. Assumption: α is a root of f in L.\n5. K/F is a Galois extension. Assumption: K/F is a Galois extension.\n6. K is contained in L. Assumption: K is a subfield of L.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that f splits over K into m irreducible factors each of degree d, with m = [F(α) ∩ K : F] and d = [K(α) : K].\n\nI need to ensure each assumption is one line and applies to one object. Let me check:\n\n- \"f is irreducible over F\" – yes, applies to f and F.\n- \"deg(f) = n\" – property of f.\n- \"L is the splitting field of f over F\" – property of L.\n- \"α is a root of f in L\" – property of α.\n- \"K/F is a Galois extension\" – property of K/F.\n- \"K is a subfield of L\" – relation between K and L.\n\nThat looks good. The problem statement is then about splitting into m irreducible polynomials over K with specified m and d. The user also mentioned using the Galois group G of L/F and a normal subgroup H corresponding to K. They know H permutes roots of f, fixes roots in K, and have some index relations.\n\nBut the task here is just to structure the problem as per the format, not to solve it. So the assumptions are listed, and the problem is to prove the splitting as described.",
