    "Content": "Suppose the terms of the sequence of real numbers $\\{a_n\\}$ satisfy $|a_{n+1} - a_n| \\le 2^{-n}$ for all $n$. Prove that $\\{a_n\\}$ is Cauchy. My Work So by the definition of a Cauchy sequence, for all $\\varepsilon > 0$ $\\exists N$ so that for $n,m \\ge N$ we have $|a_m - a_n| \\le \\varepsilon$. However, questions like this one make me understand that the $2^{-n}$ condition is necessary for this to be a true statement. So I am wondering how to appeal to the Cauchy definition for this proof. Do I prove that every convergent sequence is therefore Cauchy, and then try to prove convergence?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "As you said, you want to show that for any $\\epsilon>0$ there is some $n_0\\in\\Bbb N$ such that $|a_m - a_n|<\\epsilon$ whenever $m, n \\ge n_0$ . The trick is to figure out how big an $n_0$ you’re going to need to make sure that $|a_m-a_n|<\\epsilon$ no matter how far apart $m$ and $n$ are, as long as they’re both at least $n_0$ . Okay, suppose that we look at $|a_m-a_n|$ when $m$ and $n$ are not necessarily consecutive. There’s no harm in assuming that $m\\le n$ ; then $k=n-m\\ge 0$ , and we’re looking at $|a_m-a_{m+k}|$ . We only have a handle on the size of this number when $k=1$ : if $k=1$ , $|a_m-a_{m+k}|\\le 2^{-m}$ . But we also have the triangle inequality: $$\\begin{align*}\n|a_m-a_{m+k}|&=|(a_m-a_{m+1})+(a_{m+1}-a_{m+2})+\\ldots+(a_{m+k-1}-a_{m+k})|\\\\\n&\\le|a_m-a_{m+1}|+|a_{m+1}-a_{m+2}|+\\ldots+|a_{m+k-1}-a_{m+k}|\\\\\n&<2^{-m}+2^{-(m+1)}+\\ldots+2^{-(m+k-1)}\\\\\n&<\\sum_{k\\ge m}\\frac1{2^k}\\\\\n&=\\frac{\\frac1{2^m}}{1-\\frac12}\\\\\n&=\\frac1{2^{m-1}}\\;.\n\\end{align*}$$ Thus, if $m,n\\ge n_0$ , we automatically have $|a_m-a_n|<\\dfrac1{2^{m-1}}\\le\\dfrac1{2^{n_0-1}}$ . If we choose $n_0$ big enough so that $\\dfrac1{2^{n_0-1}}\\le\\epsilon$ , we’ll be in business. Is this always possible? Sure: just make sure that $2^{n_0-1}\\ge\\dfrac1\\epsilon$ , i.e., that $n_0\\ge\\log_2\\dfrac2\\epsilon$ ; this is certainly always possible.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, the question is about proving that a sequence {a_n} is Cauchy if the difference between consecutive terms is bounded by 2^{-n}. The user mentions that they know the definition of a Cauchy sequence and that they need to use the given condition involving 2^{-n}. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what a Cauchy sequence is. A sequence is Cauchy if for every ε > 0, there exists an N such that for all m, n ≥ N, the absolute difference |a_m - a_n| < ε. The key here is that the difference between any two terms beyond a certain point is smaller than any given ε.\n\nThe given condition is |a_{n+1} - a_n| ≤ 2^{-n}. This seems like a decreasing bound on the difference between consecutive terms. Since 2^{-n} forms a geometric series that converges (sum from n=1 to ∞ of 2^{-n} = 1), maybe we can use the convergence of that series to show that the sequence is Cauchy.\n\nLet me think about how to connect the consecutive differences to the general difference between a_m and a_n. Suppose m > n. Then |a_m - a_n| can be written as the sum of consecutive differences from a_n to a_m. So, |a_m - a_n| = |a_m - a_{m-1} + a_{m-1} - ... + a_{n+1} - a_n|. Using the triangle inequality, this sum is ≤ Σ_{k=n}^{m-1} |a_{k+1} - a_k|. \n\nGiven that each term |a_{k+1} - a_k| ≤ 2^{-k}, the total sum from k=n to ∞ would be Σ_{k=n}^∞ 2^{-k} = 2^{-n} + 2^{-(n+1)} + ... which is a geometric series with first term 2^{-n} and ratio 1/2. The sum of this series is 2^{-n} / (1 - 1/2) ) = 2^{-n} * 2 = 2^{ -n +1 } = 2^{ -(n -1) } = 2^{1 -n}.\n\nWait, the sum from k=n to ∞ of 2^{-k} is actually 2^{-(n-1)}. Let me check that. The sum from k=n to ∞ of 2^{-k} = 2^{-n} + 2^{-(n+1)} + ... = 2^{-n} (1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + ...) ) = 2^{-n} * 2 = 2^{-(n-1)}. Yes, that's correct. So the sum from k=n to m-1 (if m is finite) is less than or equal to 2^{-(n-1)}. \n\nBut if we take m approaching infinity, then the sum up to infinity is 2^{-(n-1)}. So, for any m ≥ n, |a_m - a_n| ≤ 2^{-(n-1)}. Therefore, to make this less than ε, we need to choose N such that 2^{-(N-1)} < ε. Taking logarithm base 2, we get -(N -1) < log2(ε), so N -1 > -log2(ε), so N > 1 - log2(ε). Since N must be an integer, we can choose N = max{1, floor(1 - log2(ε)) +1 }.\n\nThis would ensure that for all n, m ≥ N, |a_m - a_n| < ε. Therefore, the sequence is Cauchy.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't mention anything about the sequence being in the real numbers, but the original question did state \"sequence of real numbers\". So, the assumption is that {a_n} is a sequence of real numbers with the given condition on the consecutive terms. The user also mentions that the 2^{-n} condition is necessary, which makes sense because if the differences were not decreasing rapidly enough, the series might not converge, and the sequence might not be Cauchy.\n\nSo, to structure the problem according to the required format, the assumptions would include that each term of the sequence is a real number, and that the difference between consecutive terms is bounded by 2^{-n} for all n. The problem is to prove that the sequence is Cauchy under these conditions.",
