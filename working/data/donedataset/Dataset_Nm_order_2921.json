    "Content": "From Introductory Combinatorics by Richard Brualdi We have a chess master. He has 11 weeks to prepare for a competition so he decides that he will practice everyday by playing at least 1 game a day. To make sure that he's able to take a couple of breaks, he also decides that he wont play more than 12 games per week. My question is, how do you prove/dis-prove that there will be a succession of (consecutive) days in which he will play k games, $k \\geq  22$? Specifically, I don't quite understand the use of the pigeonhole principle here. Thanks in advance! :D EDIT I'll try to clarify what I'm asking: The goal is to prove that for every possible practice schedule that the chess master makes, there will always be a consecutive sequence of days such that he plays exactly k games. So for example, if k = 22, how do you prove that no matter what his schedule is like, he will always play exactly k games in r days, $1 \\leq r\\leq  77$. My main question is: what is the general method for proving different values of k ? Are there values of k (from 1 to 132 inclusive) that are impossible to obtain? Note that he does not necessarily have to play 132 games within 77 days!\nAlso, keep in mind the bounds of k .",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "For $\\displaystyle 1 \\le k \\le 24$ you can definitely show that the master must have played exactly $k$ games on some set of consecutive days, using pigeonhole principle. Suppose the total number of games the master has played till the end of day $\\displaystyle j$ is $\\displaystyle g_j$. Now consider the $\\displaystyle 154$ numbers: $\\displaystyle g_1, g_2, \\dots, g_{77}, g_1 + k, g_2 + k, \\dots, g_{77} + k$ These are a set of $\\displaystyle 154$ numbers between $\\displaystyle 1$ and $\\displaystyle 132+k$. For $\\displaystyle k \\lt 22$, two of these must be equal. Since $\\displaystyle g_i \\neq g_j$ (at least one game a day) we must have that $\\displaystyle g_j + k = g_i$ for some $\\displaystyle i,j$. For $\\displaystyle k=22$ we must have that the numbers are $\\displaystyle 1,2, \\dots, 154$, in which case, the first (and last) $\\displaystyle 22$ days, the master must have played $\\displaystyle 1$ game everyday. For $\\displaystyle k=23$, we can assume $\\displaystyle g_i \\neq 23$, and since $g_i \\ge 1$, we have $g_i + k \\neq 23$. Thus by an argument similar to above, we must have have $\\displaystyle 154$ numbers taking all values in $\\displaystyle 1, 2, \\dots, 155$, except $\\displaystyle 23$ and the master must have played $\\displaystyle 1$ game each of the last $\\displaystyle 23$ days. For $\\displaystyle k=24$, you can show that the master must have played $\\displaystyle 1$ game the first $\\displaystyle 23$ days (after eliminating one of the numbers in $\\displaystyle 133, 134 \\dots$), then a big number of games the next, violating the $\\displaystyle 12$ games per week restriction (this is where we actually used that restriction for a specific week). We might be able to use this kind of argument to show for $\\displaystyle k$ close to $\\displaystyle 24$, but for larger $\\displaystyle k$, I am guessing that you can find a set of games which will miss that (perhaps a computer search will help there).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. So the chess master has 11 weeks, which is 77 days, right? Each day he plays at least 1 game. So the minimum total games he can play is 77 games (if he plays 1 each day). Then, he doesn't want to play more than 12 games per week. Since there are 11 weeks, the maximum total games would be 11*12 = 132 games. So total games possible are between 77 and 132 inclusive.\n\nThe problem is asking to prove that no matter how he schedules his games (following the daily and weekly constraints), there will be a consecutive sequence of days where he plays exactly k games, where k is at least 22. The user is specifically confused about how the pigeonhole principle applies here.\n\nWait, the original question also mentions that k can be any value from 1 to 132, but the main focus is on k >=22. The user wants to know the general method for different k and whether some k are impossible.\n\nBut according to the problem structure format, I need to list assumptions and the problem statement. Let me check the example again. The example had assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So in the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The chess master practices for 11 weeks (77 days).\n- He plays at least 1 game per day.\n- He plays no more than 12 games per week.\n- The problem is to prove that there exists a consecutive sequence of days with exactly k games, where k >=22.\n\nWait, but the problem as stated in the user's question is to prove that for any schedule, there exists a consecutive sequence of days where the total is k, specifically for k >=22. However, the user also mentions different values of k, but the main question is about k >=22.\n\nWait, the user edited the question to clarify: \"the goal is to prove that for every possible practice schedule... there will always be a consecutive sequence of days such that he plays exactly k games. So for example, if k=22, how to prove that no matter what his schedule is like, he will always have exactly k games in some consecutive days. And the main question is the general method for different k and if some k are impossible.\"\n\nBut in the problem structure, the user wants the assumptions and the problem. So the assumptions are the constraints given:\n\n- Total days: 11 weeks (77 days)\n- Each day, plays at least 1 game\n- Each week, plays no more than 12 games\n- So per week, maximum 12 games, which averages to less than 2 per day.\n\nThe problem is to prove that for any such schedule, there exists a consecutive sequence of days with exactly k games, where k >=22. Wait, but the user's original problem mentions \"k >=22\", but in the edit, he clarifies that the problem is to prove that there exists a consecutive sequence with exactly k games, for k=22 as an example. Wait, there might be confusion here.\n\nWait, the original problem says: \"how do you prove/dis-prove that there will be a succession of (consecutive) days in which he will play k games, k >= 22?\"\n\nSo the problem is whether such a sequence exists for some k >=22. Or is it for every k >=22? The user's example is k=22, so maybe the problem is to show that there exists a consecutive period where he plays exactly 22 games, but the user phrased it as k >=22, which is a bit confusing.\n\nBut actually, from the problem statement: \"he will play k games, k >=22\". So is the problem that there exists some k >=22 where such a sequence exists? Or for all k >=22? The user seems confused. Wait, in the edit, the user clarifies: \"the goal is to prove that for every possible practice schedule that the chess master makes, there will always be a consecutive sequence of days such that he plays exactly k games.\" But then he says \"for example, k=22\". So maybe the problem is actually to prove that for some k (like 22), such a sequence must exist. But the user's wording is unclear.\n\nLooking back at the original problem: \"how do you prove/dis-prove that there will be a succession of (consecutive) days in which he will play k games, k >= 22?\" So the problem is to show that there exists a consecutive sequence of days where the total number of games is at least 22. Wait, but that's different. Wait, \"he will play k games, k >=22\". So k is the number of games in that consecutive sequence. So the problem is to prove that there exists a consecutive sequence of days where he played at least 22 games. But the user's edit says \"exactly k games\". Hmm, now I'm confused. Let me recheck.\n\nOriginal problem: \"he will play k games, k >= 22\". Then the edit says: \"the goal is to prove that... he will always play exactly k games in r days\". So the user corrected the problem to be about exactly k games. So the problem is to show that for k=22, there exists a consecutive sequence of days where he plays exactly 22 games, no matter his schedule. Then the user generalizes to other k, but the main problem is about k=22. Wait, but the title is \"Chess Master Problem\" and the original problem says \"how do you prove/dis-prove that there will be a succession of consecutive days in which he will play k games, k >=22\".\n\nBut the edit clarifies: \"the goal is to prove that... there will always be a consecutive sequence of days such that he plays exactly k games\". So exact number. So the problem is, for example, k=22, prove that no matter the schedule, there is some consecutive days where he played exactly 22 games. And the same question for other k. So the main question is about whether such k exist (from 1 to 132) and how to prove for specific k like 22.\n\nBut the original problem asks \"how do you prove/disprove that there will be a succession... k >=22\". So perhaps the problem is to show that there's a consecutive sequence with at least 22 games. But the user's edit contradicts that. So the user's clarification is key here. The user says: \"the goal is to prove that... he will always play exactly k games in r days, 1<=r<=77\". So the problem is about exact k, not at least k. So in the original problem, the user wrote \"k >=22\", but in the edit, clarified that it's exactly k. So maybe there was a mistake in the original problem statement. Therefore, the correct problem is to prove that for some k (like 22), there must exist a consecutive sequence with exactly k games, regardless of the schedule. And the question is about the general method.\n\nTherefore, structuring the problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- The chess master practices for 11 weeks (77 days).\n- Each day, he plays at least 1 game.\n- Each week, he plays no more than 12 games.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that for any practice schedule adhering to the above constraints, there exists a consecutive sequence of days where the total number of games played is exactly k, where k >=22. Alternatively, depending on the correct problem statement. But according to the user's edit, the problem is about exact k, so maybe the problem is:\n\nProve that for any practice schedule, there exists a consecutive sequence of days where the total number of games is exactly 22.\n\nBut the user mentions \"k >=22\" and asks about the general method for different k. Hmm. Wait, maybe the original problem is to show that there exists some k >=22 such that there's a consecutive sequence with exactly k games. Or that for all k in some range, such sequences exist. The problem is a bit ambiguous. But given the user's clarification in the edit, the problem is: for a given k (e.g., 22), prove that regardless of the schedule, there exists a consecutive sequence with exactly k games. So the user is asking, for different k (from 1 to 132), how to prove whether such a consecutive sequence must exist. The user is particularly interested in k=22 and the general method.\n\nBut in the example given by the user, the problem was about divisibility. For the current problem, the key is to structure the problem into assumptions and problem statement.\n\nSo, the assumptions are:\n\n- Total practice period is 11 weeks (77 days).\n- Each day, the chess master plays at least 1 game.\n- Each week (7 days), he plays no more than 12 games.\n\nThe problem is to prove that for any such schedule, there exists a consecutive sequence of days where the total number of games played is exactly k, where k >=22. However, the user also asks if there are values of k from 1 to 132 that are impossible. But the original problem is about proving for k >=22. Wait, no, the user is asking two things:\n\n1. For the specific problem, prove that there's a consecutive sequence with exactly k games, k >=22.\n\n2. General method for different k and whether some k are impossible.\n\nBut according to the user's problem structure, I need to present the problem as per the example. So the example had assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property. Then the problem statement.\n\nSo, in this case, the assumptions are:\n\n- The chess master practices for 77 days.\n- Each day, he plays at least 1 game.\n- Each week, he plays at most 12 games.\n\nProblem: Prove that for any such schedule, there exists a consecutive sequence of days where he plays exactly k games, where k >=22.\n\nBut the user also mentions the range of k from 1 to 132 and asks if some are impossible. However, the main problem is about k >=22. But perhaps the problem as stated is to prove that for k=22, such a sequence exists, and the user is also asking about other k. However, since the format requires to present the problem as given, the original problem was to prove that there exists a consecutive sequence with k >=22. But the user's edit contradicts that, saying exactly k. So I need to parse carefully.\n\nWait, the original problem says: \"how do you prove/dis-prove that there will be a succession of (consecutive) days in which he will play k games, k >=22?\"\n\nBut then the user edited to clarify that the goal is to prove that there is a consecutive sequence with exactly k games. So perhaps the original problem had a typo, and \"k >=22\" was meant to be \"k=22\". Alternatively, the problem is to show that there exists a consecutive sequence with exactly k games where k is at least 22.\n\nBut that seems odd. If you need to have exactly 22, or higher, but exact counts. However, in combinatorics, such problems usually refer to the existence of a consecutive sum equal to a particular value. The classic problem is that if you have a number of days with certain sums, there's a consecutive block that sums to a specific number. For example, the Erdos-Ginzburg-Ziv theorem, or using pigeonhole on cumulative sums.\n\nIn this case, with the constraints given, the problem is likely to use cumulative sums and the pigeonhole principle to show that some k must exist. The total number of games is between 77 and 132. If we consider cumulative sums S_0, S_1, ..., S_77, where S_0=0 and S_i is the total games up to day i. Then, we can look at the differences S_j - S_i for j > i. The problem is to show that some difference equals 22.\n\nBut the pigeonhole principle would say that if you have enough cumulative sums modulo some number, you can find two that are congruent, leading to a difference divisible by that number. However, in this case, the problem might be structured differently.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the master plays at least 1 game per day, so the sequence is strictly increasing. The maximum number of games in a week is 12, so over 11 weeks, 132 games. To find a consecutive sequence summing to 22. Given that each day he plays at least 1, the minimum total over r days is r. So for 22, the minimum number of days is 1 (if he plays 22 in one day), but since he can't play more than 12 in a week, he can't play more than 12 in 7 days. Wait, but the per week limit is 12 games, which is over 7 days. So per day, he can play up to 12 in a week, but spread out. So in a week, he could play 12 games in one day and 0 others, but the problem states he plays at least 1 game each day. Therefore, each day he plays between 1 and 12 games per week. Wait, no: the problem says he plays no more than 12 games per week. Since he has 7 days, and each day at least 1, the maximum per day would be 12 - 6 = 6, but that's not necessarily. Wait, if each week he plays at most 12 games, and each day at least 1, then the maximum number of games in a week is 12, but since there are 7 days, each day he must play at least 1, so 7 games minimum per week. Therefore, per week, he plays between 7 and 12 games.\n\nTherefore, total games over 11 weeks: between 77 and 132.\n\nNow, the problem is to prove that there's a consecutive sequence of days where the total games equal exactly 22. But how?\n\nBut the user is asking how to apply the pigeonhole principle here. So likely, considering cumulative sums modulo 22, but I need to structure the problem.\n\nSo, given all this, the assumptions should be:\n\n- The chess master practices for 77 days.\n- Each day, he plays at least 1 game.\n- Each week (7 days), he plays at most 12 games.\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists a consecutive sequence of days where he plays exactly 22 games.\n\nBut the user mentions k >=22. Alternatively, the problem might be to prove that there exists a consecutive sequence with at least 22 games, but the edit says \"exactly k\". The confusion arises from the original wording. Given the user's edit, the problem is about exactly k, so likely the correct problem is to prove that for k=22, there must be a consecutive sequence summing to 22.\n\nBut the user's example in the problem structure had the original problem involving divisibility by 91, and the formatted version clarified the assumptions and problem. So here, similarly, the formatted problem should capture the key assumptions and the precise problem.\n\nGiven the user's clarification, the problem is to prove that for any schedule adhering to the constraints, there exists a consecutive sequence of days with exactly k games. The example given was k=22, but the user is asking about the general method for different k and whether some k are impossible.\n\nHowever, the original problem's title mentions \"Chess Master Problem\" and the user wrote \"k >=22\". But based on the edit, it's about exact k. So perhaps the problem as intended is: Prove that for any schedule, there exists a consecutive sequence of days where the total games equal exactly 22.\n\nBut the user also mentions \"how do you prove different values of k\" and \"are there values of k from 1 to 132 inclusive that are impossible\". So the problem is more general, but the specific question is about k=22.\n\nHowever, to follow the example format, we need to structure the specific problem. The original problem is to prove that there exists a consecutive sequence of days where he plays k games, k >=22. But the edit says it's exactly k. So the problem statement should be adjusted based on the user's clarification.\n\nTherefore, the correct assumptions are:\n\n- The chess master has an 11-week (77-day) practice period.\n- Each day, he plays at least 1 game.\n- Each week (7 days), he plays at most 12 games.\n\nProblem: Prove that for any such schedule, there exists a consecutive sequence of days where the total number of games played is exactly 22.\n\nBut wait, the user's edit says: \"the goal is to prove that... he will always play exactly k games in r days, 1<=r<=77\". So the general problem is, for any k (with example k=22), prove that such a consecutive sequence exists. But the original problem mentions \"k >=22\". However, the edit clarifies that the user wants to know for different k, not just >=22. But the original problem was specifically about k>=22.\n\nThis is conflicting. Given the original problem's title and content, I think the intended problem is to prove that there exists a consecutive sequence of days with at least 22 games. However, the user's edit contradicts that, saying \"exactly k games\". To resolve this, perhaps the original problem had a typo, and the correct problem is about exact k=22. Given that the user's example in the edit uses k=22, and the problem structure example focuses on a specific divisibility, it's likely that the problem is about exact k=22.\n\nTherefore, structuring the problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- The chess master practices for 77 days.\n- Each day, he plays at least 1 game.\n- Each week, he plays no more than 12 games.\n\nProblem: Prove that for any such schedule, there exists a consecutive sequence of days where the total number of games played is exactly 22.\n\nBut the user also mentions other values of k. However, following the example, we need to structure the specific problem asked. The original problem mentions \"k >=22\", but the edit clarifies it's exactly k. So perhaps the problem is to prove that there exists a consecutive sequence of days with exactly 22 games. Hence, the assumptions and problem as above.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is about the existence of a consecutive sequence with at least 22 games, then the problem statement would be different. But given the user's clarification, it's about exact k.\n\nTo double-check, in combinatorics, the standard problem is about exact sums. For example, using the pigeonhole principle on cumulative sums mod n to find a subsequence summing to n. So likely, the problem is about exact k=22, and the method involves cumulative sums.\n\nThus, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption: \nPractice period is 77 days,\nEach day, at least 1 game is played,\nEach week (7 days), at most 12 games are played.\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a consecutive sequence of days where exactly 22 games are played.\n\nBut wait, the user's original problem says \"k >=22\", but the edit says \"exactly k\". So maybe the problem is to prove that there exists a consecutive sequence with at least 22 games. However, the classic pigeonhole principle problems usually target exact sums, so I'm torn. But given the user's edit, it's about exact k.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be that there exists a consecutive sequence with sum >=22, but the user's edit says \"exactly\". To resolve this, perhaps the original problem had a mistake, and the correct version is about exact k=22. Therefore, structuring the problem with the assumptions and the problem statement to reflect that.",
