    "Content": "A classical knot is defined to be an embedding $S^1 \\to \\mathbb{R}^3$ where $S^1$ is a 1-sphere or circle. Embeddings $S^1 \\to \\mathbb{R}^4$ are usually not considered knots because they are trivial knots, i.e., they can be continuously deformed to $S^1$. How can I show that such embeddings are indeed trivial knots?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The following theorem is implicit in the paper by Blankinship, where it is proven that for each $n\\ge 3$ and $q\\in [1, n]$ , there exists a subset $A\\subset {\\mathbb R}^n$ homeomorphic to the (closed) $q$ -dimensional cube and whose complement is not simply-connected. Note that this result also shows that not all 2-dimensional topological disks in ${\\mathbb R}^4$ are isotopic to each other. William A. Blankinship , Generalization of a construction of Antoine , Ann. Math. (2) 53, 276-297 (1951). ZBL0042.17601 . Theorem. For every $n\\ge 4$ there exists a nontrivial (wild) 1-dimensional knot $K\\subset {\\mathbb R}^n$ . Proof. Blankinship proves that for each $n\\ge 4$ , there exists a subset $C\\subset R^n$ homeomorphic to the classical cantor set such that $R^n\\setminus C$ is not simply-connected (the complement is necessarily connected by the Alexander duality). Now, take such $C$ . I proved in my answer here that for every totally disconnected compact $C$ in ${\\mathbb R}^n$ (e.g. one as above), there exists a subset $K\\subset {\\mathbb R}^n$ homeomorphic to $S^1$ and containing $C$ . Moreover, in the construction $K$ can be chosen such that each component of $K\\setminus C$ is a smooth (open) arc in ${\\mathbb R}^n$ . (There are at most countably many of these components.) Lemma. $\\pi_1({\\mathbb R}^n \\setminus K)\\ne 1$ . Proof. Since $\\pi_1({\\mathbb R}^n \\setminus C)\\ne 1$ , there is a smooth loop $c: S^1\\to {\\mathbb R}^n \\setminus C$ which is not null-homotopic in ${\\mathbb R}^n \\setminus C$ . A priori, the image of $c$ intersects $A=K \\setminus C$ . However, by perturbing $c$ to be transversal to $A$ , since $n\\ge 2$ , we can find a loop $c_1$ homotopic to $c$ in $R^n \\setminus K$ and whose image is disjoint from $A$ . Hence, $c_1$ is a homotopically nontrivial loop in ${\\mathbb R}^n \n\\setminus K$ (since it is already homotopically nontrivial in the complement to $C$ ). qed On the other hand, if $T\\subset {\\mathbb R}^n$ , $n\\ge 4$ , is a trivial knot, $\\pi_1({\\mathbb R}^n\\setminus T)=1$ . Thus, the knot $K$ constructed above nontrivial. qed What Andrew's answer proves that every tame 1-dimensional knot in ${\\mathbb R}^4$ (and, more generally, ${\\mathbb R}^n, n\\ge 4$ ) is trivial, i.e. is ambient isotopic to a round circle. The knot constructed in my proof is wild. In particular, step 1 in Andrew's answer breaks down for general knots. On the positive side: Theorem. If $K\\subset {\\mathbb R}^3$ is a topological knot, then $K$ is unknotted in ${\\mathbb R}^4$ . Proof. The key is to prove that $K$ is tame (or locally flat ) as a knot in ${\\mathbb R}^4$ , i.e. for every $x\\in K$ there is a neighborhood $U$ of $x$ in ${\\mathbb R}^4$ and a homeomorphism $U\\to V\\subset {\\mathbb R}^4$ sending $U\\cap K$ to a subset of a straight line $L\\subset {\\mathbb R}^4$ . Once it is done, it follows from the main theorem of H. Gluck, Unknotting $S^ 1$ in $S^ 4$ , Bull. Am. Math. Soc. 69, 91-94 (1963). ZBL0108.36503 . that $K$ is unknotted in ${\\mathbb R}^4$ . Let $f: K\\to [0,1]$ with exactly two point of minimum and maximum, $f(a)=0, f(b)=1$ . Let $\\alpha, \\beta$ denote the closures of the components of $K\\setminus \\{a, b\\}$ . The function $f$ defines an embedding $K\\to {\\mathbb R}^4$ , $$\n\\phi: x\\mapsto (x, f(x)), x\\in K,  \n$$ whose image is a knot $K'$ in ${\\mathbb R}^4$ . Let $a':= \\phi(a)=a, b':= \\phi(b)$ . Step 1. $K'$ is ambient-isotopic to $K$ in ${\\mathbb R}^4$ . First, extend $f$ to a continuous function $f: {\\mathbb R}^3\\to [0,1]$ .\nFor each $t\\in [0,1]$ define the \"shear\" $$\nh_t(x, s)= (x, s+tf(x)), x\\in {\\mathbb R}^3, s\\in {\\mathbb R} \n$$ which is clearly a homeomorphism. This defines an ambient isotopy of the knot $K$ to the knot $K'=f_1(K)$ in ${\\mathbb R}^4$ . Step 2. I will now prove a slightly easier result than unknottedness of $K'$ in ${\\mathbb R}^4$ , I will show that the arc $\\alpha'=\\phi(\\alpha)$ (and, similarly, $\\beta'=\\phi(\\beta))$ is tame, equivalently, unknotted in $R^4$ . Note that $\\alpha'$ intersects each horizontal slice ${\\mathbb R}^3 \\times \\{s\\}\\subset {\\mathbb R}^4$ in exactly one point, namely, $(f^{-1}(s), s)$ . The straight-line segment $I':=a'b'$ intersects each slice ${\\mathbb R}^3 \\times \\{s\\}\\subset {\\mathbb R}^4$ also at exactly one point, $p_s$ .\nThus, the shear $$\nh^\\alpha: (x, s) \\mapsto (x + (p_s- f^{-1}(s)), s), s\\in [0,1]   \n$$ is a homeomorphism ${\\mathbb R}^3\\times [0,1]\\to {\\mathbb R}^3\\times [0,1]$ sending $\\alpha'$ to $I'$ ; this homeomorphism is the identity on the boundary of the slab ${\\mathbb R}^3\\times [0,1]$ . Hence, $h$ extends to a homeomorphism ${\\mathbb R}^4\\to{\\mathbb R}^4$ (by the identity outside of the slab). Linear interpolation again yields an isotopy $h^\\alpha_t, t\\in [0,1]$ , of $h$ to the identity map. Hence, the arc $\\alpha'$ is unknotted in ${\\mathbb R}^4$ . Note that $\\{h^\\alpha_t(\\alpha'): t\\in [0,1]\\}$ lies inside the convex hull of the arc $\\alpha'$ in ${\\mathbb R}^4$ . The same construction applies to the arc $\\beta'$ resulting in an isotopy $h^\\beta$ . The trouble is that we cannot combine these \"straightening\" maps of $\\alpha', \\beta'$ . We obtain, however, that the knot $K'$ is tame in ${\\mathbb R}^4$ , except possibly at the points $a', b'$ . More precisely, $K'$ is the concatenation of two tame arcs, $\\alpha', \\beta'$ . Since $K$ is ambient-isotopic to $K'$ in ${\\mathbb R}^4$ , it follows that $K$ was tame in ${\\mathbb R}^4$ as well, except possibly at the points $a, b$ . But the points $a, b$ in $K$ were chosen arbitrarily.  Hence, $K\\subset {\\mathbb R}^4$ locally flat at every point, i.e. is tame.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user is asking why all knots become trivial in 4D, specifically why embeddings of S^1 into R^4 are trivial. First, I need to recall some knot theory basics. In 3D, knots exist because the extra dimension allows for entanglement, but in higher dimensions, there's more \"room\" to untangle them. \n\nWait, the question mentions that embeddings S^1 → R^4 are trivial. So I need to show that any such embedding can be deformed to a standard circle. How does one usually prove that something is trivial? Maybe using isotopy or ambient isotopy. \n\nIn 3D, the existence of non-trivial knots relies on the fact that you can't pass strands through each other without intersecting, but in 4D, you might have an extra dimension to move them around. Maybe using the concept of general position or transversality? \n\nAnother thought: In 4D, two 1-dimensional manifolds can be perturbed to not intersect, because their dimensions satisfy that the sum of their dimensions is less than the ambient dimension. Here, two 1D manifolds in 4D would have 1+1=2 < 4, so they can be made disjoint. Wait, but how does that relate to unknotting?\n\nAlternatively, consider that a knot is trivial if it bounds a disk. In 4D, maybe you can find a disk more easily. But for a circle in 4D, can we always find an embedded disk? That's related to the concept of slice knots, but here the assertion is that all knots are trivial, not just slice.\n\nWait, perhaps the key idea is that in 4D, any knot can be isotoped to the standard unknot. The usual method involves using the Whitney trick. In 3D, the Whitney trick fails because of dimension limitations, but in 4D, it works to eliminate intersections. So if you have a knotted circle, you might use the extra dimension to \"undo\" the crossings by moving parts of the knot through the fourth dimension.\n\nAlternatively, think about the fundamental group. In 3D, the complement of the unknot has a fundamental group of Z, but in higher dimensions, maybe all complements are simply connected? Not sure. \n\nWait, another approach: the codimension. A knot in n dimensions is an embedding of S^1 into R^n. The codimension is n-1. For unknotting, high codimension helps. When the codimension is at least 3, knots become trivial. Wait, in 4D, the codimension is 4-1=3. So maybe that's the key. There's a theorem that says that if the codimension is at least 3, then all knots are trivial. \n\nSo the answer probably relies on the fact that in 4D, the codimension is 3, which allows for enough room to untie the knot. This might involve general position arguments or the Whitney trick. The user wants a demonstration of why such embeddings are trivial. \n\nPutting this together, the steps would be: 1) Note that in 4D, the codimension is 3. 2) Use general position to show that any two embeddings can be isotoped to each other, or that any knot can be isotoped to the unknot. 3) Alternatively, show that any knot can be \"smoothed out\" by moving strands through the fourth dimension where there's no obstruction. \n\nI need to structure this into assumptions and the problem. The original question states that embeddings S^1→R^4 are trivial. The assumptions would be the definitions given. Let me check the example again. The example had assumptions like n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Here, the problem is about embeddings of S^1 into R^4. So the assumptions would include that the embedding is a smooth (or continuous?) map, and maybe that it's a classical knot when considered in 3D. Wait, the problem states that in 4D, they're trivial. So the assumptions are:\n\n- An embedding is a continuous (or smooth) injective map from S^1 to R^4.\n\n- The question is to show that such an embedding is ambient isotopic to the standard S^1 in R^4.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"they can be continuously deformed to S^1\". So the assumption is that the embedding is in R^4, and the problem is to show it's trivial (i.e., isotopic to the standard embedding). \n\nSo formatting as per the user's example:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- An embedding $S^1 \\to \\mathbb{R}^4$ is considered.\n\n- The embedding is a continuous (or smooth?) map.\n\nProblem: Show that any such embedding can be continuously deformed to the standard embedding of $S^1$ in $\\mathbb{R}^4$, i.e., is a trivial knot.\n\nBut the user's example had specific mathematical conditions. Maybe here, the key assumptions are the ones given in the problem statement. Let me check the original question again:\n\nOriginal question: \"A classical knot is defined to be an embedding $S^1 \\to \\mathbb{R}^3$... Embeddings $S^1 \\to \\mathbb{R}^4$ are usually not considered knots because they are trivial knots, i.e., they can be continuously deformed to $S^1$. How can I show that such embeddings are indeed trivial knots?\"\n\nSo the assumptions from the problem are:\n\n- The embedding is from $S^1$ to $\\mathbb{R}^4$.\n\n- The embedding is considered as a knot (but in 4D).\n\nThe problem is to show that such embeddings are trivial (can be deformed to the standard S^1).\n\nSo the formatted version would list the assumptions as:\n\nAssumption: $S^1$ is a 1-sphere (circle),\n\nAssumption: The embedding $S^1 \\to \\mathbb{R}^4$ is continuous,\n\nProblem: Show that the embedding can be continuously deformed to the standard $S^1$ in $\\mathbb{R}^4$, i.e., is a trivial knot.\n\nWait, but the example given by the user had two assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Each assumption addresses one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo here, the objects are the embedding and the spaces involved. So each assumption should be one line, addressing one property.\n\nSo maybe:\n\nAssumption: $S^1$ is a 1-dimensional sphere,\n\nAssumption: The embedding is a continuous map $f: S^1 \\to \\mathbb{R}^4$,\n\nAssumption: The trivial knot in $\\mathbb{R}^4$ is the standard embedding of $S^1$,\n\nProblem: Prove that any embedding $f$ can be continuously deformed to the trivial knot.\n\nBut maybe the user's example is more concise. Let me look:\n\nIn the example, the original problem had \"Prove that for every integer n...\" and the formatted version listed assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\" and problem as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\"\n\nSo in this case, the problem mentions \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem didn't state that n must be divisible by 7. That might have been a mistake. Wait, no. Wait the example seems to have filtered the original problem, which maybe had more context. Anyway, following the example, the key is to list all assumptions of the problem as per the user's instructions.\n\nOriginal problem here states: \"A classical knot is defined to be an embedding S^1 → R^3 ... embeddings S^1 → R^4 ... can be continuously deformed to S^1. How to show such embeddings are trivial?\"\n\nSo assumptions needed for the problem:\n\n- An embedding is defined as a continuous (and maybe smooth?) injective map.\n\n- The problem is in R^4.\n\n- The knot is trivial if it can be deformed to the standard S^1 via an ambient isotopy.\n\nBut the user's example lists assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. So for this problem:\n\nAssumption: $S^1$ is a 1-dimensional sphere,\n\nAssumption: The embedding $f: S^1 \\to \\mathbb{R}^4$ is continuous,\n\nAssumption: A trivial knot in $\\mathbb{R}^4$ is an embedding isotopic to the standard inclusion of $S^1$,\n\nProblem: Prove that any embedding $f: S^1 \\to \\mathbb{R}^4$ is a trivial knot.\n\nBut maybe the first assumption is redundant since S^1 is defined as the circle. However, the example included \"n is an integer\" which is redundant if the problem states \"for every integer n\". So perhaps in the problem here, it's similar: list the key components.\n\nWait, the problem is: \"Why are all knots trivial in 4D? A classical knot is defined to be an embedding S^1→R^3... embeddings S^1→R^4 are usually not considered knots because they are trivial knots, i.e., can be continuously deformed to S^1. How can I show such embeddings are indeed trivial knots?\"\n\nSo the key points are:\n\n- The embedding is of S^1 into R^4.\n\n- The embedding is considered as a knot.\n\n- Trivial knot means it can be deformed to the standard S^1.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have assumptions:\n\nAssumption: The knot is an embedding $S^1 \\to \\mathbb{R}^4$,\n\nAssumption: A trivial knot in $\\mathbb{R}^4$ is one that is ambient isotopic to the standard embedding of $S^1$,\n\nProblem: Prove that every embedding $S^1 \\to \\mathbb{R}^4$ is a trivial knot.\n\nBut each assumption must address only one property. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption: $S^1$ is a circle (1-dimensional sphere),\n\nAssumption: The embedding is a continuous injective map $f: S^1 \\to \\mathbb{R}^4$,\n\nAssumption: Two embeddings are considered equivalent if they are ambient isotopic,\n\nProblem: Prove that every embedding $f: S^1 \\to \\mathbb{R}^4$ is ambient isotopic to the standard embedding of $S^1$ in $\\mathbb{R}^4$.\n\nAlternatively, considering the original question says \"continuously deformed to S^1\", which might refer to ambient isotopy.\n\nBut the example from the user seems to list the mathematical conditions given in the problem. The original problem here mentions that embeddings S^1→R^4 are trivial, so the key assumption is the embedding is into R^4, and the problem is to prove triviality.\n\nTherefore, following the example:\n\nAssumption: The embedding is a map $S^1 \\to \\mathbb{R}^4$,\n\nAssumption: The embedding is a knot (i.e., a smooth embedding),\n\nProblem: Prove that the embedding is trivial (can be continuously deformed to the standard $S^1$).\n\nBut the user's example had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So maybe here, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption: $S^1$ is embedded into $\\mathbb{R}^4$,\n\nAssumption: The embedding is continuous (or smooth, depending on context),\n\nProblem: Prove that the embedding can be continuously deformed to the standard $S^1$ in $\\mathbb{R}^4$.\n\nBut perhaps the original problem doesn't specify smoothness, just continuous. The question mentions \"continuously deformed\", so it's about continuous isotopy.\n\nBut to match the user's example, which extracted assumptions from the original problem. The original problem says \"A classical knot is defined to be an embedding S^1 → R^3...\", so the assumption here is that the embedding is in R^4. The problem is to show it's trivial.\n\nSo formatted:\n\nAssumption: The embedding is a map $S^1 \\to \\mathbb{R}^4$,\n\nAssumption: A trivial knot in $\\mathbb{R}^4$ is one that can be continuously deformed to the standard $S^1$,\n\nProblem: Prove that every embedding $S^1 \\to \\mathbb{R}^4$ is a trivial knot.\n\nBut in the example, assumptions are properties of the objects in the problem. Here, the key is that the embedding is into R^4, and the problem is to show triviality. Since the original problem mentions that in R^3 they are non-trivial but in R^4 they are trivial, the assumption is the ambient space is R^4.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nAssumption: The ambient space is $\\mathbb{R}^4$,\n\nAssumption: The embedded object is $S^1$,\n\nProblem: Prove that any embedding of $S^1$ into $\\mathbb{R}^4$ is a trivial knot.\n\nAlternatively, more precisely:\n\nAssumption: $f: S^1 \\to \\mathbb{R}^4$ is a continuous embedding,\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists a continuous deformation from $f$ to the standard embedding of $S^1$ in $\\mathbb{R}^4$.\n\nBut the user's example listed each assumption line by line. Let me check again:\n\nIn the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", so the formatted assumption was \"n is an integer\", and separately \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem didn't state that. Wait, no, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, which factors into 7*13, so the user must have deduced that n must be divisible by 7 and 13? Wait, no. Wait the example given by the user is:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer,\n\nAssumption: n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut that seems incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so n isn't necessarily divisible by 7. Unless there was a typo. Maybe the original problem had n divisible by 7, but the example here might not align. Anyway, following that example, perhaps the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the key conditions are that the embedding is S^1 → R^4 and the problem is to show it's trivial. So the formatted version would be:\n\nAssumption: The embedding is $S^1 \\to \\mathbb{R}^4$,\n\nAssumption: A trivial knot is defined as one isotopic to the standard $S^1$,\n\nProblem: Prove that any embedding $S^1 \\to \\mathbb{R}^4$ is a trivial knot.\n\nBut each assumption must address only one property. So maybe:\n\nAssumption: The domain of the embedding is $S^1$,\n\nAssumption: The codomain of the embedding is $\\mathbb{R}^4$,\n\nAssumption: The embedding is continuous (or smooth),\n\nProblem: Prove that the embedding is isotopic to the standard embedding of $S^1$ in $\\mathbb{R}^4$.\n\nBut I need to check the original problem statement again. The original problem states that embeddings S^1→R^4 are trivial. The question is how to show that. So the problem is about embeddings of S^1 into R^4, and the task is to prove they are trivial.\n\nSo following the example, the formatted problem would list the assumptions as:\n\nAssumption: $S^1$ is embedded into $\\mathbb{R}^4$,\n\nProblem: Prove that such an embedding is a trivial knot, i.e., can be continuously deformed to the standard $S^1$.\n\nBut the example had two assumptions. Here, perhaps:\n\nAssumption: $f: S^1 \\to \\mathbb{R}^4$ is an embedding,\n\nAssumption: A trivial knot in $\\mathbb{R}^4$ is an embedding isotopic to the standard inclusion,\n\nProblem: Prove that $f$ is a trivial knot.\n\nBut the original problem doesn't mention isotopy, just continuous deformation. So maybe \"continuously deformed\" refers to ambient isotopy. Therefore:\n\nAssumption: $f: S^1 \\to \\mathbb{R}^4$ is a continuous embedding,\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists an ambient isotopy deforming $f$ to the standard embedding of $S^1$ in $\\mathbb{R}^4$.\n\nAlternatively, following the user's example structure where assumptions are listed line by line:\n\nAssumption: $S^1$ is a 1-dimensional sphere,\n\nAssumption: The embedding is a continuous map $S^1 \\to \\mathbb{R}^4$,\n\nProblem: Prove that the embedding can be continuously deformed to the standard $S^1$ in $\\mathbb{R}^4$.\n\nThis seems closer to the example. Each assumption is one property: first the nature of S^1, second the nature of the embedding. The problem is to show the deformation.\n\nAnother point: in the original problem, it's mentioned that in R^3, these are classical knots, but in R^4 they're trivial. So perhaps the key assumption is the ambient space is R^4.\n\nThus, the formatted answer would be:\n\nAssumption: The ambient space is $\\mathbb{R}^4$,\n\nAssumption: The embedded space is $S^1$,\n\nProblem: Prove that any embedding of $S^1$ into $\\mathbb{R}^4$ is a trivial knot.\n\nBut the example had two assumptions for the variable n. Here, the ambient space and the embedded space are two different objects. Each line addresses one property of one object. So yes, that seems appropriate.",
