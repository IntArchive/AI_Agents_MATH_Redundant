    "Content": "Let $f$ and $g$ be two periodic functions over $\\Bbb{R}$ with the following property: If $T$ is a period of $f$, and $S$ is a period of $g$, then $T/S$ is irrational. Conjecture : $f+g$ is not periodic. Could you give a proof or a counter example?  It is easier if we assume continuity.  But is it true for arbitrary real valued functions?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here is a counterexample.  Let $a, b, c \\in \\mathbb{R}$ be linearly independent over $\\mathbb{Q}$.  Let $\\text{span}(x, y, z, ...)$ be the $\\mathbb{Q}$-vector space in $\\mathbb{R}$ spanned by $x, y, z, ...$.  Let $AB = \\text{span}(a, b), BC = \\text{span}(b, c), AC = \\text{span}(a, c)$.  And for a subset $S$ of $\\mathbb{R}$, let $\\chi_S$ denote the characteristic function of $S$.  Now define $\\displaystyle f(x) = \\chi_{AB} - 2 \\chi_{BC}$ and $\\displaystyle g(x) = 3 \\chi_{AC} + 2 \\chi_{BC}.$ Then $f$ has period set $\\text{span}(b)$, $g$ has period set $\\text{span}(c)$, and $f + g$ has period set $\\text{span}(a)$.  (I am not sure if the coefficients are necessary; they're just precautions.) Are you still interested in the continuous case? (Old answer below.  I slightly misunderstood the question when I wrote this.) Here is a simpler example.  I claim that the function $h(x) = \\sin x + \\sin \\pi x$ cannot possibly be periodic.  Why?  Suppose an equation of the form $\\sin x + \\sin \\pi x = \\sin (x+T) + \\sin \\pi (x+T)$ held for all $x$ and some $T > 0$.  Take the second derivative of both sides with respect to $x$ to get $\\sin x + \\pi^2 \\sin \\pi x = \\sin (x+T) + \\pi^2 \\sin \\pi(x+T).$ This implies that $\\sin x = \\sin (x+T)$ and that $\\sin \\pi x = \\sin \\pi(x+T)$, which is impossible. (Or is the question whether the sum can be periodic?)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to parse the original question carefully and extract the necessary information.\n\nThe original question is about periodic functions. The user mentions two functions, f and g, which are periodic over the real numbers. The key condition here is that for any period T of f and any period S of g, the ratio T/S is irrational. The conjecture is that the sum f + g is not periodic. The question also asks if this holds true for arbitrary real-valued functions, mentioning that it's easier if we assume continuity.\n\nNow, applying the format provided, I need to list the assumptions line by line, each addressing only one property or condition applied to one object. Then, state the problem clearly.\n\nFirst, identify the objects involved: f, g. The conditions are:\n\n1. f is a periodic function over ℝ.\n2. g is a periodic function over ℝ.\n3. For any period T of f and any period S of g, the ratio T/S is irrational.\n\nThe problem is to prove or provide a counterexample to the conjecture that f + g is not periodic. Additionally, the question asks whether this holds for arbitrary functions (without assuming continuity), even though the easier case assumes continuity.\n\nWait, in the example given by the user, the assumption included specific conditions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, the conditions are about the periods of f and g. Each assumption should be a single line, one property per line. Let me make sure to break them down properly.\n\nSo, the assumptions would be:\n\n- f is a periodic function over ℝ.\n- g is a periodic function over ℝ.\n- For every period T of f and every period S of g, the ratio T/S is irrational.\n\nThen the problem is to prove or disprove that f + g is not periodic. Also, addressing whether the conjecture holds for arbitrary functions, not just continuous ones. However, the original problem as stated includes the conjecture and asks for proof or counterexample, considering both cases with and without continuity. But in the formatting example, the problem part is concise. So perhaps the problem statement here would be the conjecture itself, and the rest (about continuity) is part of the original question but needs to be incorporated into the problem statement appropriately.\n\nWait, the example given had the problem statement as \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91.\" So in this case, the problem is \"Prove that f + g is not periodic\" under the given assumptions. However, the original question also asks about whether it's true for arbitrary functions even if continuity isn't assumed. So how to structure that?\n\nThe user's example included assumptions that were specific to the problem. Here, the problem's assumptions are about the periods of f and g. The additional part about continuity is a conditional case; the user mentions \"It is easier if we assume continuity. But is it true for arbitrary real valued functions?\" So perhaps the problem is two parts: first, under the given period conditions, prove f+g isn't periodic, and then whether this holds without continuity. But according to the format, maybe we need to split into two problems? But the original question is a single problem. Hmm.\n\nWait, the original question states the conjecture and then asks for a proof or counterexample, with a note that it's easier if continuity is assumed but wants to know if it's true for arbitrary functions. So perhaps the problem statement should encapsulate both parts: the main conjecture under the given period conditions, and the additional question about continuity. But how to structure that?\n\nLooking back at the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem included assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7, then the problem statement. In this case, the problem as posed has two parts: the conjecture under the given period conditions, and whether the same holds without continuity. However, the example provided only had a single problem statement. Perhaps in this case, the problem is the conjecture, and the question about continuity is part of the problem's inquiry. Therefore, the problem should be stated as: \"Prove or provide a counterexample to the conjecture that f + g is not periodic. Additionally, determine if the conjecture holds for arbitrary real-valued functions (without assuming continuity).\"\n\nBut the user's example kept the problem concise. Let me check the example again. The original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted problem listed the assumptions (n is integer, n is divisible by 7), then the problem. The original question here is similar: under the given period conditions, prove the sum isn't periodic, and whether it's true for arbitrary functions. So perhaps the assumptions include the period conditions, and the problem is to prove the sum isn't periodic, with the additional question about the arbitrary functions (without continuity) included in the problem statement.\n\nBut according to the user's instructions, the formatted problem should list the assumptions line by line and then state the problem. The original problem includes the period ratio being irrational, so that's an assumption. The continuity is a separate consideration. Wait, the original problem states: \"If T is a period of f, and S is a period of g, then T/S is irrational. Conjecture: f+g is not periodic. Could you give a proof or a counter example? It is easier if we assume continuity. But is it true for arbitrary real valued functions?\"\n\nSo the main problem is the conjecture under the given period ratio condition. Then, the additional part is whether it's true for arbitrary functions (i.e., without assuming continuity). The original problem has two parts: the conjecture under the period ratio condition, and whether it's true even when functions aren't continuous.\n\nBut in the user's example, the assumption included the divisibility by 7. So in this case, the assumptions are:\n\n1. f and g are periodic over ℝ.\n2. For any period T of f and any period S of g, T/S is irrational.\n\nThen, the problem is: Prove or provide a counterexample to the conjecture that f + g is not periodic. Additionally, determine whether the conjecture holds for arbitrary real-valued functions (without assuming continuity).\n\nBut the problem statement must be concise. The original example had a single problem statement. However, the original question here has two aspects: the conjecture under given conditions, and whether continuity is necessary. So perhaps the problem should be phrased as: \"Prove or provide a counterexample to the conjecture that f + g is not periodic. Is the conjecture true for arbitrary real-valued functions (without assuming continuity)?\"\n\nBut the user's format requires the problem to be a single statement. Maybe the way to structure it is to combine both parts into the problem statement. Alternatively, the problem is the conjecture, and the rest is part of the problem's query.\n\nAlternatively, the original problem's title is \"Sum of two periodic functions\", and the question is about the conjecture under the given period ratio condition, then the user adds that it's easier with continuity but asks about the general case.\n\nSo, structuring the assumptions as:\n\nAssumption: f is a periodic function over ℝ.\n\nAssumption: g is a periodic function over ℝ.\n\nAssumption: For every period T of f and every period S of g, T/S is irrational.\n\nProblem: Prove or provide a counterexample to the conjecture that f + g is not periodic. Additionally, determine if the conjecture holds for arbitrary real-valued functions without assuming continuity.\n\nBut the example didn't have \"additionally\" part. However, in the example, the original problem had an assumption (n divisible by 7) which was included. Here, the original question's problem is two parts: the main conjecture, and the question about continuity. So maybe the problem statement should be split, but according to the user's example, it's kept as a single problem. Perhaps the problem statement is as originally posed, and the additional part about continuity is part of the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to prove the conjecture under the given assumptions, and the additional question is about the case without continuity. But since the user's example didn't have multiple questions, maybe the problem statement includes both parts. Let me check the original problem again:\n\n\"Let $f$ and $g$ be two periodic functions over $\\Bbb{R}$ with the following property: If $T$ is a period of $f$, and $S$ is a period of $g$, then $T/S$ is irrational. Conjecture : $f+g$ is not periodic. Could you give a proof or a counter example? It is easier if we assume continuity. But is it true for arbitrary real valued functions?\"\n\nSo the problem is to prove or give a counterexample to the conjecture, and also address whether it's true for arbitrary functions (i.e., not necessarily continuous). So the problem is two parts. However, the user's format example has a single problem statement. Therefore, perhaps in the formatted problem, the problem statement is:\n\n\"Prove or provide a counterexample to the conjecture that $f + g$ is not periodic. Additionally, determine whether the conjecture holds for arbitrary real-valued functions (without assuming continuity).\"\n\nBut the example's problem was \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91.\" So perhaps the problem should be more concise. Alternatively, maybe the original problem is to address both the conjecture and the continuity aspect. Therefore, the problem is:\n\n\"Prove or provide a counterexample to the conjecture that $f + g$ is not periodic. Is the conjecture true for arbitrary real-valued functions without assuming continuity?\"\n\nBut to adhere to the example's style, perhaps the problem is stated as the conjecture, and the rest is part of the problem's requirement. The example included the main problem and any specific conditions in the assumptions. So here, the assumptions are the periodicity and the ratio condition. The problem is to prove the sum isn't periodic, and the additional part about continuity is part of the problem's inquiry.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumptions:\n- $f$ is a periodic function over $\\mathbb{R}$.\n- $g$ is a periodic function over $\\mathbb{R}$.\n- For every period $T$ of $f$ and every period $S$ of $g$, the ratio $T/S$ is irrational.\n\nProblem:\nProve or provide a counterexample to the conjecture that $f + g$ is not periodic. Additionally, determine if the conjecture holds for arbitrary real-valued functions without assuming continuity.\n\nBut perhaps the problem statement should be more concise. Alternatively, the original problem's title is \"Sum of two periodic functions\", so the main problem is about proving the sum isn't periodic under the given period ratio condition, and the additional part is a follow-up question about continuity. However, the user's example included only the main problem and relevant assumptions. Since the user's instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\", maybe the problem is the conjecture, and the rest is part of the problem's body. But since the user provided an example where the original problem's conditions were split into assumptions, I think the way to go is:\n\nAssumptions:\n- $f$ is a periodic function over $\\mathbb{R}$.\n- $g$ is a periodic function over $\\mathbb{R}$.\n- For every period $T$ of $f$ and every period $S$ of $g$, the ratio $T/S$ is irrational.\n\nProblem:\nProve or provide a counterexample that $f + g$ is not periodic. Additionally, determine if the conjecture holds for arbitrary real-valued functions without assuming continuity.\n\nBut the example didn't have \"additionally\". However, since the original question asks two things (proof/counterexample and whether it's true without continuity), we need to capture both in the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps the main problem is the conjecture, and the other part is a secondary question, but according to the user's example, the problem is a single statement. Maybe the way to combine it is:\n\n\"Prove or provide a counterexample that $f + g$ is not periodic. Is this true for arbitrary real-valued functions without continuity assumptions?\"\n\nBut I need to follow the user's example. Let me look again at the example:\n\nOriginal problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions were n is integer, n divisible by 7. Then the problem was to prove the expression is divisible by 91. So the problem was restated concisely.\n\nIn this case, the original problem is to prove that f + g isn't periodic under the given period ratio condition. The additional part is about continuity. So perhaps the problem is two parts, but the user's format allows only one problem statement. Therefore, to adhere to the format, the problem statement would be:\n\n\"Prove or provide a counterexample to the conjecture that $f + g$ is not periodic. Additionally, determine whether the conjecture holds for arbitrary real-valued functions (without assuming continuity).\"\n\nBut the example didn't have \"additionally\", but maybe it's acceptable. Alternatively, maybe the problem is split into two, but since the user's example had one problem, perhaps it's better to combine both parts into the problem statement.\n\nAnother angle: The original problem's main question is the conjecture, and the part about continuity is a follow-up. So perhaps the problem is stated as:\n\n\"Prove or provide a counterexample that $f + g$ is not periodic. Furthermore, is the conjecture true when $f$ and $g$ are arbitrary real-valued functions (without assuming continuity)?\"\n\nBut in the user's example, the problem was a single statement. Given that, perhaps the formatted problem should be:\n\nProblem: Prove or provide a counterexample that $f + g$ is not periodic. Is this conjecture true for arbitrary real-valued functions without continuity assumptions?\n\nBut since the user's example had only one problem statement, maybe it's better to combine the two parts into one problem statement. Alternatively, the original question includes both aspects, so it's part of the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to prove the conjecture under the given assumptions, and then separately address the case without continuity. But according to the format, it's one problem. Therefore, the problem is as stated in the original question, with the additional query about continuity included.\n\nIn conclusion, the assumptions are the three points about f and g being periodic and their periods having irrational ratios. The problem is the main conjecture plus the continuity question. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: \n$f$ is a periodic function over $\\mathbb{R}$,\n$g$ is a periodic function over $\\mathbb{R}$,\nFor every period $T$ of $f$ and every period $S$ of $g$, the ratio $T/S$ is irrational.\n\nProblem: \nProve or provide a counterexample to the conjecture that $f + g$ is not periodic. Additionally, determine if the conjecture holds for arbitrary real-valued functions without assuming continuity.\n\nBut in the example, the problem was a single statement. Let me check the example again:\n\nOriginal problem had the expression and the question to prove divisibility by 91. The formatted problem listed the assumptions (n integer, n divisible by 7) and the problem was to prove the expression is divisible by 91.\n\nIn this case, the original problem's main body is to prove the conjecture, with a follow-up about continuity. However, in the formatted example, the additional condition (n divisible by 7) was included in the assumptions, even though the original problem didn't state that. Wait, the original example's original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems odd. Wait, no, perhaps the example was a mistake. Wait, in the example, the original problem was:\n\n\"Prove that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\"\n\nBut the formatted problem had assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should only be that n is an integer. However, the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", which is not in the original problem. That suggests maybe the example had an error, but the user provided it as an example. Therefore, perhaps in the user's example, they included an assumption that was not in the original problem. Therefore, maybe the user expects to extract assumptions from the problem, even if they are not explicitly stated but derived.\n\nBut in this current problem, the original question states the conditions: f and g are periodic, and for any periods T and S of f and g respectively, T/S is irrational. Therefore, these are the assumptions. The problem is to prove the sum is not periodic, and whether it holds without continuity.\n\nTherefore, following the example's structure, even if the example included an assumption not in the original problem (like n divisible by 7), perhaps here we need to list the explicit assumptions given in the problem.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n$f$ is a periodic function over $\\mathbb{R}$,\n$g$ is a periodic function over $\\mathbb{R}$,\nFor every period $T$ of $f$ and every period $S$ of $g$, the ratio $T/S$ is irrational.\n\nProblem:\nProve or provide a counterexample to the conjecture that $f + g$ is not periodic. Additionally, determine if the conjecture holds for arbitrary real-valued functions without assuming continuity.\n\nHowever, in the example, the problem statement was concise. So perhaps the \"additionally\" part is omitted, and the problem is only about the conjecture. But the original question explicitly asks about the arbitrary case. Therefore, the problem should include both parts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is split into two:\n\nProblem 1: Prove or provide a counterexample to the conjecture that $f + g$ is not periodic under the given assumptions.\n\nProblem 2: Determine if the conjecture holds for arbitrary real-valued functions without continuity assumptions.\n\nBut the user's format example had a single problem. Therefore, to adhere to the example's structure, perhaps the problem is stated as:\n\nProve or provide a counterexample that $f + g$ is not periodic. Additionally, determine if this holds for arbitrary real-valued functions without assuming continuity.\n\nBut I think the user's example might have had a mistake in the assumption part, adding an extra condition. But given that, we proceed.\n\nAnother angle: The original problem's main conjecture is that f + g is not periodic given the irrational ratio condition. The additional question is whether this is true without continuity. So the problem is two parts: the main conjecture and the extension. But according to the user's format, it's a single problem. Therefore, we need to phrase it as a single problem statement that includes both parts.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: \n$f$ is a periodic function over $\\mathbb{R}$,\n$g$ is a periodic function over $\\mathbb{R}$,\nFor every period $T$ of $f$ and every period $S$ of $g$, the ratio $T/S$ is irrational.\n\nProblem: \nProve or provide a counterexample that $f + g$ is not periodic. Is the conjecture true for arbitrary real-valued functions without continuity assumptions?\n\nThis captures both the main conjecture and the additional query about continuity. However, in the example, the problem was a statement (\"Prove that...\"), not a question. Therefore, perhaps rephrase to:\n\nProve or provide a counterexample that $f + g$ is not periodic, and determine whether this holds for arbitrary real-valued functions without continuity assumptions.\n\nBut the original problem uses \"Could you give a proof or a counter example? It is easier if we assume continuity. But is it true for arbitrary real valued functions?\" So the problem has two parts: the main conjecture and the continuity question. Therefore, the formatted problem should include both.\n\nBut the user's example shows that the problem is one statement. Therefore, perhaps combining both into the problem statement:\n\nProve or provide a counterexample that $f + g$ is not periodic, and determine whether the conjecture holds for arbitrary real-valued functions without assuming continuity.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is:\n\nProve or provide a counterexample to the conjecture that $f + g$ is not periodic. Additionally, investigate whether the conjecture remains valid for arbitrary real-valued functions without continuity assumptions.\n\nBut since the example's problem was a single imperative statement, perhaps the correct formatting is:\n\nProblem: Prove or provide a counterexample that $f + g$ is not periodic. Determine if the conjecture holds for arbitrary real-valued functions without continuity assumptions.\n\nHowever, this is two sentences. The example had one sentence. Therefore, maybe it's better to present it as a single problem statement with both parts included.\n\nIn conclusion, after carefully considering the original question and the example format, the formatted problem should list the three assumptions and then the problem statement combining both the main conjecture and the continuity aspect.",
