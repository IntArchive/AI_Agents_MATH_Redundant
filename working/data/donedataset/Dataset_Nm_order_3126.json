    "Content": "If $A$ is a stochastic matrix, then $A$ is entry-wise nonnegative and $Ae = e$ , i.e., $(1,e)$ is a right eigenpair for $A$ . Is it true that there exists a vector $b$ such that $$(A - I)x \\geq b$$ has no solutions in $x$ ?  If so, is there a simple proof? Motivation: I've been trying to construct an answer to another question using linear programming duality (as the OP implies he is interested in).  If my reasoning is correct, this is the only step I need to complete the argument.  I feel like this should be an easy question to answer, but I've been working on it for a while with no success.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Your inequality $(A-I)x \\ge b$ has no solutions in $x$ as soon as $b>0$. Indeed, any potential solution would have to satisfy $A x \\ge  x + b$ and, since rows of $A$ are nonnegative and sum to one, each element of vector $Ax$ is a convex combination of the components of $x$, which must be less than $x_{max}$, the largest component of $x$. On the other hand, at least one element of $x+b$ is greater than $x_{max}$, which proves the impossibility. By the way, applying Farkas' Lemma to this impossible system shows that the following always admits solutions in y\n$$y^T (A-I) = 0, y \\ge 0 \\text{ and } y^T b > 0$$\nwhich expresses the fact that $A$ necessarily admits a nonnegative left eigenvector with eigenvalue $1$ (the last inequality ensures that $y$ is nonzero).",

For example, let $b$ be any vector where the sum of its components is positive. Since each row of $A - I$ sums to $0$, the sum of all components of $(A - I)x$ is $0$ for any $x$.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user is asking whether, given a stochastic matrix A, there exists a vector b such that the inequality (A - I)x ≥ b has no solutions in x. They also want to know if there's a simple proof for this.\n\nFirst, let's recall what a stochastic matrix is. A stochastic matrix is a square matrix where each entry is non-negative and each row sums to 1. So, A is entry-wise nonnegative, and Ae = e, where e is the vector of all ones. That gives us that 1 is an eigenvalue of A with eigenvector e.\n\nNow, the inequality in question is (A - I)x ≥ b. Let me parse this. The matrix A - I will have rows that each sum to 0 because each row of A sums to 1, and subtracting the identity matrix I subtracts 1 from each diagonal entry. So each row of A - I sums to 0. Therefore, if we multiply A - I by any vector x, each component of the resulting vector (A - I)x is a linear combination of the entries of x, weighted by the row entries of A - I, which sum to zero.\n\nThe inequality (A - I)x ≥ b means that each component of the vector (A - I)x is greater than or equal to the corresponding component of b. The question is whether there exists some b such that this system of inequalities has no solution x.\n\nLet me think about the properties of A - I. Since A is stochastic, all eigenvalues of A have modulus ≤ 1. The matrix A - I has eigenvalues shifted by -1, so the eigenvalues of A - I are of the form λ - 1 where λ is an eigenvalue of A. Therefore, all eigenvalues of A - I have real parts ≤ 0. However, since A is stochastic, 1 is an eigenvalue, so 0 is an eigenvalue of A - I. This suggests that A - I is singular, which means that the equation (A - I)x = 0 has non-trivial solutions (specifically, scalar multiples of e, the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 1). \n\nBut we're dealing with inequalities here, not equations. Let's consider if we can find a b such that (A - I)x ≥ b is impossible. Since (A - I)x is a vector where each component is a linear combination of x's entries with coefficients summing to zero, perhaps there's a relation that must hold among the components of (A - I)x. For example, if we sum all the components of (A - I)x, since each row of A - I sums to zero, the sum would be zero. Therefore, if we take the sum over all components of the left-hand side (A - I)x, we get zero. On the other hand, if the inequality (A - I)x ≥ b holds, then the sum of the left-hand side components would be ≥ the sum of the components of b. But since the sum of the left-hand side is zero, this requires that the sum of the components of b must be ≤ 0. So, if we choose a vector b where the sum of its components is positive, then there can be no solution x, because the left-hand side would have to sum to zero, which is less than the sum of b's components. \n\nFor example, take b to be a vector where each component is ε > 0. Then, the sum of b's components would be nε (for an n x n matrix), which is positive. Since the sum of (A - I)x is zero, it cannot be ≥ nε. Therefore, such a vector b would make the inequality unsolvable. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"there exists a vector b\" such that there's no solution. So, in this case, choosing any b with positive sum would work. Therefore, the answer should be yes, such a b exists, and the proof is by considering the sum of the components. \n\nBut let me check this reasoning again. If (A - I)x ≥ b, then summing over all components: sum_{i} [(A - I)x]_i ≥ sum_{i} b_i. But since each row of A - I sums to zero, sum_{i} [(A - I)x]_i = sum_{i} [sum_{j} (A - I)_{ij} x_j] = sum_{j} x_j sum_{i} (A - I)_{ij} } = sum_{j} x_j * 0 = 0. Therefore, 0 ≥ sum b_i. So, if sum b_i > 0, the inequality cannot hold. Therefore, choosing any b with sum of entries positive would work. For example, b = (1, 0, 0, ..., 0), but sum b_i =1 >0. Hence, this vector b would make the inequality impossible. \n\nTherefore, the answer is yes, such a vector b exists, and the proof is straightforward by considering the sum of the components. The key insight is that the sum of the left-hand side must be zero, so if the sum of b's components is positive, there's no solution.",
