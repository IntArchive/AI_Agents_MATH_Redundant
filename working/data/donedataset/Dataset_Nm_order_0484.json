    "Content": "Ok, I'm reading some thesis of some former students, and come up with this proof, but it doesn't really look good to me. So I guess it should be wrong somewhere. So, here it goes: Let $R$ be a unitary commutative ring, and $I$ be an ideal, and $N$ is an $R$-module. I'll now show that $$I \\otimes_R N \\cong IN\\,.$$ First, since $1 \\in R$, and $I$ is an ideal of $R$, we must have that $I = RI$. So then $$I \\otimes_R N = RI \\otimes_R N = R \\otimes_R IN \\cong IN\\,.$$ But this must be so wrong, since if this proof is true, I could prove that any $R$-module is flat. So how come this proof is wrong?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The equality $RI\\otimes_R N=R\\otimes_R IN$ is very subtly false: the point is that it does not hold in $I\\otimes_RN$, which is the only place where it could hold. But,  since tensor product is $R-$bilinear,  can't we  write (for example)  $1\\cdot i\\otimes n=1\\otimes i\\cdot n \\:$? No, we can't! Because $1\\otimes i\\cdot n$ does not make sense in $I\\otimes_RN$, since $1\\notin I$ and thus $1$ may not be put on the left-hand side of $\\otimes_R$ in $I\\otimes_RN$.",

The isomorphism $R \\otimes_R IN \\cong IN$ is valid, but the equality $I \\otimes_R N = R \\otimes_R IN$ is unjustified. The mistake stems from conflating the structure of $I$ as an $R$-module with a free $R$-module, which is only true if $I$ is principal and generated by a non-zero-divisor (not guaranteed here). Consequently, the flawed reasoning would falsely imply all $R$-modules are flat. A correct proof requires analyzing the natural map $I \\otimes_R N \\to IN$ and addressing its bijectivity directly.",
    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's take a look at this problem. The user is trying to prove that I tensor N over R is isomorphic to IN, where R is a commutative unitary ring, I is an ideal, and N is an R-module. Their proof goes like this: since I is an ideal, I = RI because R has a unit. Then they replace I with RI in the tensor product, getting RI tensor N, which they say is equal to R tensor IN, and then since R tensor IN is isomorphic to IN, they conclude the proof. But they realize this must be wrong because it would imply all modules are flat, which isn't true.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. Let's break down the problem. The ring R is unitary and commutative. The ideal I is part of R, and N is an R-module. The main claim is that I tensor_R N is isomorphic to IN, which is the submodule of N generated by elements of the form an where a is in I and n is in N.\n\nNow, the user's proof starts by saying I = RI. That's correct because in a ring with unity, the ideal I is equal to R*I since multiplying by 1 gives back the elements of I. Then they replace I with RI in the tensor product. So, RI tensor_R N. The next step is where the mistake might be. They say RI tensor_R N is equal to R tensor_R IN. Wait, is that correct? Let me think.\n\nThe tensor product RI tensor N is isomorphic to (R tensor I) tensor N, but actually, RI is already I as an R-module. So perhaps they're trying to use some property of tensor products here. But the step from RI tensor N to R tensor IN seems off. Let me recall that tensor product distributes over direct sums, but here we're dealing with products. Maybe they are using that R tensor_R IN is isomorphic to IN, which is true because R tensor_R M is isomorphic to M for any R-module M. But the problem is in the step where they equate RI tensor N with R tensor IN.\n\nWait, actually, RI is I as an R-module, so RI tensor N is I tensor N. But they replaced RI tensor N with R tensor IN. That step is not justified. Because RI is I, but R tensor IN would be R tensor (I*N). However, the tensor product I tensor N is not the same as R tensor IN. The user is confusing the isomorphism here. The correct approach would be to consider the multiplication map from I tensor N to IN sending a tensor n to a*n. But to show it's an isomorphism, you need more conditions. For example, if N is flat, or if I is a flat module, but the problem states R is just commutative unitary, and I is any ideal. The mistake is in assuming that I tensor N is equal to R tensor IN, which isn't generally true. The step where they write RI tensor N = R tensor IN is incorrect because RI is I, but R tensor IN is not the same as I tensor N. The error is in that specific isomorphism step. The user tried to factor out R from RI tensor N, but that's not valid because I is an ideal, not a free module. So the structure of I might not allow such a factorization. Hence, the mistake is in the line where they replace RI tensor N with R tensor IN. This isn't a valid tensor product isomorphism unless certain conditions are met, which aren't specified here. Therefore, the problem's assumptions are R is commutative with 1, I is an ideal of R, N is an R-module, and the claim is I tensor N ≅ IN. The user's proof is incorrect because of the invalid step in manipulating the tensor product.",
