    "Content": "I want to solve the following exercise from Dummit & Foote's Abstract Algebra: Prove that subgroups and quotient groups of solvable groups are solvable My attempt: Let $G$ be a solvable group with a chain $1=G_0 \\triangleleft G_1 \\triangleleft \\dots \\triangleleft G_s=G$ such that all factors $G_i/G_{i-1}$ are abelian. Let $H \\leq G$ be a subgroup. We claim that the chain $1=H_0 \\leq H_1 \\leq \\dots \\leq H_s=H$ where $H_i=G_i \\cap H$ does the trick. Firstly we prove that $H_i \\triangleleft H_{i+1}$ for all $i$. Let $x \\in H_{i+1}=G_{i+1} \\cap H$. Since $x \\in H$ we have $x H x^{-1}=H$. Since $x \\in G_{i+1} \\triangleright G_i$ we have $xG_i x^{-1}=G_i$. Combining these gives $x(H \\cap G_i) x^{-1}=H \\cap G_i$, as required. Next, we prove that the quotients $H_{i+1}/H_i=(G_{i+1} \\cap H)/(G_i \\cap H)$ are abelian. Let $x,y \\in G_{i+1} \\cap H$. We would like to prove that $xy (G_i \\cap H)=yx (G_i \\cap H)$. Observe that using the fact the cosets of $G_i$ in $G_{i+1}$ can be interchanged, we find \\begin{equation}\n\\begin{split}\n&xy (G_i \\cap H)=(xy G_i) \\cap (xy H)=(x G_i) (y G_i) \\cap H=(y G_i)(x G_i) \\cap (yx H)\\\\\n&=(yx G_i) \\cap (yx H)=yx (G_i \\cap H).\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation} Let $N \\trianglelefteq G$ be a normal subgroup, and let $G/N$ be the corresponding quotient group. We suggest the following normal chain: \\begin{equation}\n1=G_0/ N  \\triangleleft G_1/  N \\triangleleft \\dots \\triangleleft G_s/ N =G/N.\n\\end{equation} We first prove that $G_i/N \\triangleleft G_{i+1}/N$: Let $gN \\in G_{i+1}/N,aN \\in G_i/N$. We have $(gN)(aN)(gN)^{-1}=(gag^{-1})N$. Since $G_i \\trianglelefteq G_{i+1}$ the element $gag^{-1} \\in G_i$, which gives $(gN)(G_i/N)(gN)^{-1} \\in G_i/N$ for all $gN \\in G_{i+1}/N$. The quotients (or factors) are \\begin{equation}\n(G_{i+1}/N) \\big/ (G_i/N),\n\\end{equation}\nand we wish to prove they are abelian. Indeed, let $g_1N(G_iN),g_2 N(G_iN) \\in (G_{i+1}/N) \\big/ (G_i N)$ (i.e. $g_1,g_2 \\in G_{i+1}$). These two arbitrary elements commute iff \\begin{equation}\n[g_2Ng_1N]^{-1}[g_1Ng_2N] \\in G_i/N\n\\end{equation}\nwhich is equivalent to the condition $g_1^{-1}g_2^{-1}g_1g_2 \\in G_i$. Since we have that the quotient $G_{i+1}/G_i$ is abelian we know that $(g_1G_i)(g_2G_i)=(g_2G_i)(g_1 G_i)$ which gives precisely this condition. We conclude that quotient groups of solvable groups are solvable. Is my solution correct? If not, please help me fix it. Thanks!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "As Eric Auld mentioned in the comment, the statement that $G_0/N=1/N$ is incorrect. To fix this, you may use the normal chain\n$$\\begin{equation}\n1=G_0N/ N  \\triangleleft G_1N/  N \\triangleleft \\dots \\triangleleft G_sN/ N =G/N.\n\\end{equation}$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this problem. The user is asking if their solution is correct for proving that subgroups and quotient groups of solvable groups are solvable. They followed Dummit & Foote's exercise. \n\nFirst, I need to structure their question into the required format. The assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. The problem statement is to prove those two things: subgroups and quotients of solvable groups are solvable.\n\nLooking at the original problem, the user's assumptions are that G is a solvable group with a normal chain where each factor is abelian. Then they take a subgroup H and a quotient G/N. \n\nSo, the main assumptions here are:\n\n1. G is a solvable group.\n2. There exists a chain of subgroups 1 = G_0 ◃ G_1 ◃ ... ◃ G_s = G such that each G_i/G_{i-1} is abelian.\n3. H is a subgroup of G.\n4. N is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nEach of these should be separate lines in the assumptions. The problem is to prove that H and G/N are solvable.\n\nThe user's solution involves constructing chains for H and G/N and checking normality and abelian factors. But the task here is just to structure the problem, not evaluate the solution. So the formatted problem should capture the original exercise: proving subgroups and quotient groups of solvable groups are solvable, with the assumptions being the solvable group G, its subgroup H, and normal subgroup N.",
