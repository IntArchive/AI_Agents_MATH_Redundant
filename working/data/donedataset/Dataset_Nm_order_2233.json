    "Content": "I was trying to prove that a uniformly bounded local martingale is a martingale. Clearly a bounded local martingale is integrable. I know how to show that a lower bounded local martingale is a supermartingale using Fatous's Lemma but somehow I cannot show that a uniformly bounded local martingale is a sub-martingale. Any hints on how could I show that?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $(M_t)_{t \\geq 0}$ be a uniformly bounded local martingale. Then there exists a sequence of stopping times $(\\tau_k)_k$ such that $\\tau_k \\uparrow \\infty$ and $(M_{t \\wedge \\tau_k})_t$ is a martingale for each $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$, i.e. $$\\mathbb{E}(M_{t \\wedge \\tau_k} \\mid \\mathcal{F}_s) = M_{s \\wedge \\tau_k}$$ for all $ s\\leq t$ and $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Since $M$ is uniformly bounded, it follows from the dominated convergence theorem that $$\\begin{align*} M_s &= \\lim_{k \\to \\infty} M_{s \\wedge \\tau_k} = \\lim_{k \\to \\infty} \\mathbb{E}(M_{t \\wedge \\tau_k} \\mid \\mathcal{F}_s) = \\mathbb{E}(M_t \\mid \\mathcal{F}_s). \\end{align*}$$ This shows that $M$ is a martingale.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement from the original question.\n\nThe title is \"A uniformly bounded local martingale is a martingale.\" The question mentions trying to prove that a uniformly bounded local martingale is a martingale. It states that a bounded local martingale is integrable, and the user knows how to show a lower bounded local martingale is a supermartingale using Fatou's Lemma but is stuck on showing a uniformly bounded one is a submartingale.\n\nSo, the key points here are:\n1. The local martingale is uniformly bounded.\n2. The goal is to prove it's a martingale.\n\nAssumptions need to be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. The problem statement should be the actual thing to prove.\n\nOriginal problem mentions \"uniformly bounded local martingale\" – so the assumptions would include that it's a local martingale and that it's uniformly bounded. The problem is to show it's a martingale.\n\nWait, but the user mentions integrability. The original problem states \"Clearly a bounded local martingale is integrable.\" So maybe the assumption is that the local martingale is uniformly bounded, hence integrable. But the main issue is showing it's a martingale, not just integrable. The user is stuck on showing it's a submartingale, which is part of proving it's a martingale.\n\nBut according to the problem structure example, the assumptions are listed as separate lines. So for this case, the assumptions would be:\n\n- $(M_t)$ is a local martingale.\n- $(M_t)$ is uniformly bounded.\n\nProblem: Prove that $(M_t)$ is a martingale.\n\nBut let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem had an expression, and the formatted problem listed assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Then the problem is to prove the expression is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem's assumption was \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem split into two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, actually, looking at the original problem: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, the assumptions are n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Hmm, maybe the original problem had a mistake? Wait, no. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Wait, perhaps the example was incorrect. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, it's stated as assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. So the problem then is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. Wait, but the original problem didn't have the divisibility by 7. So maybe there's an error in the example. But regardless, the structure is that the assumptions are all the conditions, each on one line.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's question is to prove that a uniformly bounded local martingale is a martingale. The assumptions here are that the process is a local martingale and that it is uniformly bounded. So:\n\nAssumption: \n$(M_t)$ is a local martingale,\n$(M_t)$ is uniformly bounded.\n\nProblem: Prove that $(M_t)$ is a martingale.\n\nBut the user mentions integrability, but in the problem statement, the user says \"Clearly a bounded local martingale is integrable.\" So perhaps the assumption is that the local martingale is uniformly bounded (hence integrable), but the problem is to prove it's a martingale. So maybe the assumptions are just the two points above. The problem is to show that under these conditions, it's a martingale.\n\nAlternatively, if the uniform boundedness implies integrability, then maybe the integrability is part of the problem, but the user already knows that part. The main task is to show the martingale property. So yes, the problem is to show that a uniformly bounded local martingale is a martingale. So the formatted version would be:\n\nAssumption:\n$(M_t)$ is a local martingale,\nThere exists a constant $C > 0$ such that $|M_t| \\leq C$ almost surely for all $t \\geq 0$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $(M_t)$ is a martingale.\n\nBut to align with the example, perhaps the uniform boundedness is the key assumption, and the problem is to show it's a martingale. So the answer should structure the problem accordingly.",
