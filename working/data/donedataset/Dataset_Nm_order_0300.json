    "Content": "A parallelizable manifold $M$ is a smooth manifold such that there exist smooth vector fields $V_1,...,V_n$ where $n$ is the dimension of $M$, such that at any point $p\\in M$, the tangent vectors $V_1(p),...,V_n(p)$ provide a basis for the tangent space at $p$. Equivalently, a manifold is parallelizable if its tangent bundle is trivial. There is a theorem that states that any compact orientable 3-manifold is parallelizable, and \nthere is a proof of this result which uses $spin^c$ structures and the Steifel-Whitney class. I am wondering whether there exists a more elementary, perhaps more straightforward proof. Otherwise, I would be grateful for some intuition on why this is true.\nAlso, it the theorem still true without the compactness assumption? If so, is there a relatively simple proof in that case?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I don't know of a totally elementary proof of this result, but here is some context for it. More generally, an $n$-manifold $M$ (without boundary) has a classifying map $f : M \\to BO(n)$ for its tangent bundle. Knowing when $M$ is parallelizable is equivalent to knowing when $f$ is null-homotopic. There is a general machine for doing this involving lifting $f$ higher and higher through the stages of the Whitehead tower of $BO(n)$, and it tells us that the complete set of obstructions to solving this problem are a set of cohomology classes in $H^k(M, \\pi_k(BO(n)), k \\le n$, each of which is well-defined provided that the previous one vanishes, such that $f$ is null-homotopic iff all of the classes vanish. The construction of the first such class goes like this. Assume for simplicity that $M$ is connected. The first question is whether $f$ lifts to the universal cover of $BO(n)$, which is true iff $f$ induces the zero map on $\\pi_1$ by standard covering space theory. Now, $\\pi_1(BO(n)) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$, and the induced map on $\\pi_1$ gives a homomorphism $\\pi_1(M) \\to \\mathbb{Z}_2$ which corresponds precisely to the first Stiefel-Whitney class $w_1$. This class vanishes iff $f$ lifts to the universal cover of $BO(n)$, which is $BSO(n)$, iff $M$ is orientable. Now we want to try lifting $f$ to the $2$-connected cover of $BSO(n)$; this is analogous to the universal cover but involves killing $\\pi_2(BSO(n)) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$ (for $n \\ge 3$) instead of $\\pi_1$. Whether this is possible is controlled by the map $$BSO(n) \\to B^2 \\mathbb{Z}_2$$ inducing an isomorphism on $\\pi_2$. This is equivalently a universal characteristic class in $H^2(BSO(n), \\mathbb{Z}_2)$ which turns out to be precisely the second Stiefel-Whitney class $w_2$. This class vanishes iff $f$ lifts to the $2$-connected cover of $BSO(n)$, which is $BSpin(n)$, iff $M$ has a spin structure. The first surprise in this story is that (when $n \\ge 3$) $BSpin(n)$ also turns out to be the $3$-connected cover; in other words, $\\pi_3(BSpin(n)) = 0$, so the next step of this story involves $\\pi_4$ and can be ignored for $3$-manifolds. If $M$ is a $3$-manifold, not necessarily compact, admitting both an orientation and a spin structure, then the classifying map of its tangent bundle lifts to a map $M \\to BSpin(3)$, but since the latter is $3$-connected any such map is nullhomotopic. So: A $3$-manifold, not necessarily closed, is parallelizable iff the first two Stiefel-Whitney classes $w_1, w_2$ vanish iff it admits an orientation and a spin structure. To give an indication of the generality of this machinery, for $4$-manifolds the next step involves computing $\\pi_4(BSpin(4)) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^2$ and then lifting to the $4$-connected cover of $BSpin(4)$, which is called $BString(4)$. This says that the next obstruction to a $4$-manifold with an orientation and a spin structure being parallelizable is a pair of cohomology classes in $H^4(M, \\mathbb{Z})$ which I believe turn out to be the Euler class $e$ and the first fractional Pontryagin class $\\frac{p_1}{2}$ (a certain characteristic class of spin manifolds that when doubled gives the Pontryagin class $p_1$) respectively. Since $H^4(M, \\mathbb{Z})$ is always torsion-free for a $4$-manifold, the conclusion is that A $4$-manifold, not necessarily closed, is parallelizable iff the characteristic classes $w_1, w_2, e, p_1$ all vanish iff it admits an orientation, a spin structure, and a string structure . And for $5$-manifolds and higher we really need to talk about $\\frac{p_1}{2}$ and not just $p_1$. The second surprise in this story is that for closed $3$-manifolds the condition that $w_2$ vanishes is redundant: it is implied by orientability by a standard computation with Wu classes . In other words, closed orientable $3$-manifolds automatically admit spin structures. I don't have a good intuitive explanation of this; it comes from a relationship between the Stiefel-Whitney classes, Steenrod operations, and Poincaré duality that I don't understand very well.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants me to structure the Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original question is about proving that any orientable 3-manifold is parallelizable, possibly without the compactness assumption.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The problem mentions \"any orientable 3-manifold\" and asks about the case without compactness. The original theorem states compact orientable 3-manifolds are parallelizable. The user is asking if the theorem holds without compactness and if there's a more elementary proof.\n\nSo, the assumptions in the original theorem are that the manifold is compact, orientable, and 3-dimensional. The user is questioning whether compactness is necessary. The problem as posed in the question includes both the original theorem (with compactness) and the query about the non-compact case.\n\nTherefore, for the formatted problem, the assumptions should list each condition: compactness, orientability, and dimension 3. However, the user is also asking whether the theorem remains true without compactness, so maybe the problem part should reflect both cases. Wait, but the format example shows that the problem is the main question to be answered. The user is asking two things: 1) is there an elementary proof for the compact case, and 2) does the theorem hold without compactness, with a simple proof if so.\n\nBut the example format includes listing the assumptions line by line. So perhaps in the assumptions, we need to list all the conditions that the problem assumes. The original theorem has compact, orientable, 3-manifold. The problem as posed by the user is to prove the theorem (with compactness) using an elementary method and also to check if compactness can be dropped.\n\nBut the example given in the user's instruction for the format takes the original problem's assumptions. Wait, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no. Wait, the original example was that the user restructured the problem, perhaps focusing on a specific case. Wait, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, the assumption includes that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect? Or perhaps the user is showing how to extract assumptions from the problem. Let me check.\n\nIn the example, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but that's adding a condition not present in the original problem. That seems like a mistake. Unless the user is providing an example where they're modifying the problem. Hmm, maybe the example is not accurate. Wait, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that would change the problem. Wait, maybe the example is wrong. Because if n is any integer, including those not divisible by 7, then adding the assumption that n is divisible by 7 would make the problem different. Perhaps the example is actually showing how to structure a problem where there are additional assumptions. Maybe the user made a mistake in their example. But regardless, I need to proceed with the current problem.\n\nBack to the current problem. The user's question on Math Stack Exchange is about proving that any orientable 3-manifold is parallelizable. The existing theorem includes compactness. The user is asking if there's an elementary proof for that theorem and whether the theorem still holds without compactness.\n\nSo, to structure this into the given format:\n\nAssumptions should list each condition. The original theorem's assumptions are compactness, orientability, and dimension 3. The problem part would be the main question, which is to prove that such a manifold is parallelizable. Then, the user's second question is whether the theorem holds without compactness.\n\nBut the format seems to require a single problem statement. The user's problem has two parts: 1) request for an elementary proof for compact case, and 2) whether the theorem holds without compactness. How to combine these?\n\nAlternatively, maybe separate into two problems. But the example given only structures one problem. However, the user's original question includes both parts.\n\nBut according to the user's instruction, they want the problem structured into the format. So perhaps the problem line would include both questions: \"Prove that any compact orientable 3-manifold is parallelizable with an elementary proof, and determine if the theorem holds without the compactness assumption.\"\n\nBut the example's problem line was a single statement. So perhaps the problem part should encapsulate both questions. Alternatively, maybe the assumptions include the compactness, and the problem is to prove parallelizable and address the non-compact case.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is to address both: the original theorem's proof and the non-compact case.\n\nHmm. Let me check the original question again. The user wrote:\n\n\"A parallelizable manifold M is a smooth manifold... There is a theorem that states that any compact orientable 3-manifold is parallelizable, and there is a proof of this result which uses spin^c structures and the Steifel-Whitney class. I am wondering whether there exists a more elementary, perhaps more straightforward proof. Otherwise, I would be grateful for some intuition on why this is true. Also, is the theorem still true without the compactness assumption? If so, is there a relatively simple proof in that case?\"\n\nSo, the problem has two parts:\n\n1. For compact orientable 3-manifolds, is there an elementary proof of parallelizability?\n\n2. Is the theorem true without compactness, and if so, is there a simple proof?\n\nTherefore, structuring this into the given format:\n\nAssumptions (for the original theorem):\n\n- M is a compact manifold,\n\n- M is orientable,\n\n- M is a 3-dimensional manifold.\n\nProblem: Prove that M is parallelizable using an elementary method, and determine whether the conclusion holds without the compactness assumption.\n\nBut perhaps the problem should be split. Wait, the user's format example had the problem as a single statement. Alternatively, the problem is \"Prove that any compact orientable 3-manifold is parallelizable with an elementary proof, and determine if the theorem holds without the compactness assumption.\"\n\nThus, the assumptions are the three conditions, and the problem is the two-part question.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\nM is a compact manifold,\n\nM is orientable,\n\nM is a 3-dimensional smooth manifold.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that M is parallelizable using an elementary method, and determine if the theorem remains true without the compactness assumption.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be split into two separate problems, but the user's example combined a modified problem into one. However, since the user's question includes both aspects, perhaps we need to list all three assumptions and have the problem include both parts.\n\nYes, I think that's the way to go.",
