    "Content": "Prove that $$ \\lim_{x \\to 0+} \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^n}{n!^x} =\n \\frac{1}{2}. $$ We know that $$ \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^n}{n!^x}$$ converges for any $x>0$. So I try to evaluate the limit as $x$ approaches $0$ numerically. It seems that the limit approaches $\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{2}$.

    "AcceptedAnswer": "Our main claim is as follows: Proposition. Let $(\\lambda_n)$ be an increasing sequence of positive real numbers. If $(\\lambda_n)$ satisfies $$\\lim_{R\\to\\infty} \\frac{1}{R} \\int_{0}^{R} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\mathbf{1}_{[\\lambda_{2n}, \\lambda_{2n+1}]}(x) \\, dx = \\alpha \\tag{1} $$ for some $\\alpha \\in [0, 1]$ , then $$\\lim_{s\\to0^+} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (-1)^n e^{-\\lambda_n s} = \\alpha \\tag{2} $$ Here, a sequence $(\\lambda_n)$ is increasing if $\\lambda_n \\leq \\lambda_{n+1}$ for all $n$ . As a corollary of this proposition, we obtain the following easier criterion. Corollary. Let $(\\lambda_n)$ be an increasing sequence of positive real numbers that satisfy $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\lambda_n = \\infty$ , $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\lambda_{n+1}/\\lambda_n = 1$ , $\\lambda_{2n} < \\lambda_{2n+2}$ hold for all sufficiently large $n$ and $$ \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\lambda_{2n+1} - \\lambda_{2n}}{\\lambda_{2n+2} - \\lambda_{2n}} = \\alpha. \\tag{3} $$ Then we have $\\text{(1)}$ . In particular, the conclusion $\\text{(2)}$ of the main claim continues to hold. Here are some examples: The choice $\\lambda_n = \\log(n+1)$ satisfies the assumptions with $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2}$ . In fact, this reduces to the archetypal example $\\eta(0) = \\frac{1}{2}$ . OP's conjecture is covered by the corollary by choosing $\\lambda_n = \\log(n!)$ and noting that $\\text{(3)}$ holds with $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2}$ . If $P$ is a non-constant polynomial such that $\\lambda_n = P(n)$ is positive, then $(\\lambda_n)$ must be strictly increasing for large $n$ , and using the mean value theorem we find that the assumptions are satisfied with $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2}$ . Proof of Proposition. Write $F(x) = \\int_{0}^{x} \\left( \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\mathbf{1}_{[\\lambda_{2n}, \\lambda_{2n+1}]}(t) \\right) \\, dt$ and note that \\begin{align*}\n\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (-1)^n e^{-\\lambda_n s}\n&= \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\int_{\\lambda_{2n}}^{\\lambda_{2n+1}} s e^{-sx} \\, dx\n = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} s e^{-sx} \\, dF(x) \\\\\n&= \\int_{0}^{\\infty} s^2 e^{-sx} F(x) \\, dx\n \\stackrel{u=sx}{=} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} s F(u/s) e^{-u} \\, du.\n\\end{align*} Since $0 \\leq F(x) \\leq x$ , the integrand of the last integral is dominated by $ue^{-u}$ uniformly in $s > 0$ . Also, by the assupmption $\\text{(1)}$ , we have $s F(u/s) \\to \\alpha u$ as $s \\to 0^+$ for each $u > 0$ . Therefore, it follows from the dominated convergence theorem that $$ \\lim_{s\\to0^+} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (-1)^n e^{-\\lambda_n s}\n= \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\alpha u e^{-u} \\, du\n= \\alpha, $$ which completes the proof. $\\square$ Proof of Corollary. For each large $R$ , pick $N$ such that $\\lambda_{2N} \\leq R \\leq \\lambda_{2N+2}$ . Then $$ \\frac{1}{R} \\int_{0}^{R} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\mathbf{1}_{[\\lambda_{2n}, \\lambda_{2n+1}]}(x) \\, dx \\leq \\frac{\\lambda_{2N+2}}{\\lambda_{2N}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sum_{n=0}^{N} (\\lambda_{2n+1} - \\lambda_{2n})}{\\sum_{n=0}^{N} (\\lambda_{2n+2} - \\lambda_{2n})} $$ and this upper bound converges to $\\alpha$ as $N\\to\\infty$ by Stolz–Cesàro theorem . Similar argument applied to the lower bound $$ \\frac{1}{R} \\int_{0}^{R} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\mathbf{1}_{[\\lambda_{2n}, \\lambda_{2n+1}]}(x) \\, dx \\geq \\frac{\\lambda_{2N}}{\\lambda_{2N+2}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} (\\lambda_{2n+1} - \\lambda_{2n})}{\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} (\\lambda_{2n+2} - \\lambda_{2n})} $$ proves the desired claim together with the squeezing theorem. $\\square$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that the limit as x approaches 0 from the positive side of the sum from n=0 to infinity of (-1)^n divided by n!^x is equal to 1/2. \n\nFirst, I need to structure the problem according to the given format. The original question mentions that the series converges for any x > 0, which is important. The user also notes that when x=1, the sum is 1/e, but they wonder if that helps. However, the key here is the behavior as x approaches 0+, not x=1.\n\nSo, the assumptions should list the conditions given. Each assumption is a single property. The problem statement is to prove the limit equals 1/2.\n\nWait, in the example provided, the assumption included a condition on n being divisible by 7, but in the original problem here, the user doesn't state any such condition. Wait, looking back at the example: the original problem had A(n) divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted assumption added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example was a different problem. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example: The user had to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps there was a mistake in the example. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should just be \"n is an integer\". The part \"n is divisible by 7\" might have been part of a different problem. Hmm, maybe there was a mix-up. But regardless, the user wants me to structure the current problem.\n\nLooking back at the current problem: the user mentions the series converges for any x>0. So that's an important condition. Also, the limit is as x approaches 0 from the right. So assumptions would include that x is approaching 0 from the positive side, and that the series converges for x > 0. Wait, the problem statement already says \"We know that the sum converges for any x>0\", so that's a given condition. So the assumptions should be:\n\n- The series ∑_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n / n!^x converges for any x > 0.\n- The limit is taken as x approaches 0 from the positive side.\n\nBut according to the format, each assumption addresses only one property applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe series ∑_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n / n!^x converges for each x > 0,\nx approaches 0 from the positive side.\n\nProblem: Prove that the limit is 1/2.\n\nWait, but the problem statement is to prove the limit equals 1/2. The user also mentions they checked numerically, which is part of the original question but not part of the assumptions. So in the formatted problem, we need to list the assumptions as per the problem's given conditions, not the user's attempts.\n\nSo the key assumptions here are the convergence for x > 0 and the direction of the limit (x→0+). But the problem itself is to evaluate that limit. Therefore, the formatted problem should include these assumptions.\n\nAnother point: In the example given, the assumption included two separate points: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. But in this problem, the series converges for x > 0, which is a condition, and the limit is x→0+.\n\nSo, structuring:\n\nAssumption:\nThe series ∑_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n / n!^x converges for each x > 0,\nThe limit is considered as x approaches 0 from the positive side.\n\nProblem: Prove that the limit equals 1/2.\n\nWait, but in the original example, the assumption included specific conditions on n (integer, divisible by 7). Here, the problem is about x approaching 0+, so perhaps the assumptions should be:\n\n- For each x > 0, the series ∑_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n / n!^x converges.\n- x is approaching 0 from the positive direction.\n\nEach as separate points.\n\nThus, the formatted problem should have these two assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nSo the final answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nThe series $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^n}{n!^x}$ converges for each $x > 0$,\nThe limit is taken as $x$ approaches $0$ from the positive side.\nProblem: \nProve that $$ \\lim_{x \\to 0+} \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^n}{n!^x} = \\frac{1}{2}. $$\n###",
