    "Content": "If $(V, \\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle)$ is a finite-dimensional inner product space and $f,g : \\mathbb{R} \\longrightarrow V$ are differentiable functions, a straightforward calculation with components shows that $$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\langle f, g \\rangle = \\langle f(t), g^{\\prime}(t) \\rangle + \\langle f^{\\prime}(t), g(t) \\rangle\n$$ This approach is not very satisfying. However, attempting to apply the definition of the derivative directly doesn't seem to work for me. Is there a slick, perhaps intrinsic way, to prove this that doesn't involve working in coordinates?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about differentiating an inner product of two functions from R to a finite-dimensional inner product space. The user wants a proof that doesn't use coordinates.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem mentions that V is a finite-dimensional inner product space with the inner product ⟨⋅,⋅⟩. Then, f and g are differentiable functions from R to V. The key assumptions here are about the properties of V, f, and g. Each assumption should be a single line addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo breaking it down:\n\nAssumption 1: V is a finite-dimensional inner product space.\nAssumption 2: The inner product on V is ⟨⋅,⋅⟩.\nAssumption 3: f: R → V is a differentiable function.\nAssumption 4: g: R → V is a differentiable function.\n\nI should check if these cover all necessary parts. The problem states \"finite-dimensional\", so that's important. Both f and g are differentiable, so each needs their own line. The inner product is part of the space, so that's another assumption.\n\nNow the problem statement is to prove the derivative of the inner product ⟨f, g⟩ with respect to t is equal to ⟨f(t), g’(t)⟩ + ⟨f’(t), g(t)⟩ without using coordinates. The example given in the question uses components but the user wants an intrinsic method.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have those assumptions and the problem statement.",
