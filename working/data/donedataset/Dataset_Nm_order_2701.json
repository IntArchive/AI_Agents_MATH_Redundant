    "Content": "Prove that: If $n$ is greater than 2, then $(3n)!$ is divisible by $n! \\times  (n + 1)! \\times  (n + 2)!$ From Barnard & Child's \"Higher Algebra\".

    "AcceptedAnswer": "It is an easy exercise to show that for all real numbers $x$ we have\n$$\n\\lfloor 3x\\rfloor=\\lfloor x\\rfloor+\\lfloor x+\\frac13\\rfloor+\\lfloor x+\\frac23\\rfloor.\n$$\nThus for all $n$ and all prime powers $p^t\\ge3$ we have\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\lfloor \\frac{3n}{p^t}\\rfloor&=\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p^t}\\rfloor+\n\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p^t}+\\frac13\\rfloor+\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p^t}+\\frac23\\rfloor\\\\\n&=\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p^t}\\rfloor+\n\\lfloor \\frac{n+\\frac{p^t}3}{p^t}\\rfloor+\\lfloor \\frac{n+\\frac{2p^t}3}{p^t}\\rfloor\\\\\n&\\ge \\lfloor \\frac{n}{p^t}\\rfloor+\n\\lfloor \\frac{n+1}{p^t}\\rfloor+\\lfloor \\frac{n+2}{p^t}\\rfloor.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nThis leaves us to deal with the case $p^t=2$. But because $n>2$, we see that $3n$ exceeds one power of two higher than any of $n,n+1,n+2$. If $n>4$ (thanks, Petite Etincelle!) we have $3n>2(n+2)$, and in the cases $n=3,4$ we have $3n>8>n+2$. This gives us a necessary extra term compensating for the deficiency at $p^t=2$. More precisely, if $n=2k+1$ is an odd integer, then $\\lfloor \\dfrac{3n}2\\rfloor=3k+1$ in comparison to\n$$\n\\lfloor\\frac n2\\rfloor+\\lfloor\\frac{n+1}2\\rfloor+\\lfloor\\frac{n+2}2\\rfloor=k+(k+1)+(k+1)=3k+2.\n$$\nOn the other hand, if $n=2k$ is even, then $\\lfloor \\dfrac{3n}2\\rfloor=3k$ and\n$$\n\\lfloor\\frac n2\\rfloor+\\lfloor\\frac{n+1}2\\rfloor+\\lfloor\\frac{n+2}2\\rfloor=k+k+(k+1)=3k+1.\n$$\nIn either case we are missing a single factor two, so having that single extra term suffices. Summing the above inequalities for $p^t\\ge3$ and coupling the terms corresponding to $p^t=2$ and $p^t=2^\\ell$, where $\\ell$ is the largest integer such that $2^\\ell\\le 3n$ shows that for all primes $p$ we have\n$$\n\\sum_{t>0}\\lfloor\\frac{3n}{p^t}\\rfloor\\ge\n\\sum_{t>0}\\lfloor\\frac{n}{p^t}\\rfloor+\\sum_{t>0}\\lfloor\\frac{n+1}{p^t}\\rfloor+\\sum_{t>0}\\lfloor\\frac{n+2}{p^t}\\rfloor.\n$$\nThe claim follows from this.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the given problem according to their specified structure. The example they provided shows breaking down the assumptions into individual points and then stating the problem. \n\nLooking at the Math Stack Exchange question, the title is about proving that (3n)! is divisible by n! × (n+1)! × (n+2)! when n > 2. The question body mentions using the formula for the highest power of a prime p in N! which involves the sum of floor functions. The user is stuck showing that the formula gives a higher value for N=3n than the sum for n, n+1, and n+2, especially with n > 2.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that n is greater than 2. Also, the divisibility condition applies to (3n)! divided by the product of n!, (n+1)!, and (n+2)!. The prime power formula is part of their attempted approach but isn't an assumption of the problem itself, so I shouldn't include that in the assumptions.\n\nSo the key assumptions here are:\n1. n is an integer (since factorial is defined for integers).\n2. n is greater than 2.\n\nThe problem is to prove that (3n)! is divisible by the product of those three factorials under the given assumptions.\n\nWait, but in the example provided, the assumption was split into two lines: one about n being an integer and another about it being divisible by 7. So following that structure, even if the original problem states \"if n is greater than 2\", the assumptions should list each condition separately. Therefore, here, n being an integer and n > 2 are two separate assumptions.\n\nI should check if the original problem mentions n being an integer explicitly. The title says \"if n is greater than 2\", but factorial is defined for integers, so n must be an integer. However, in the original question, the user might have assumed n is an integer without stating. Since the example included \"n is an integer\" even if the original problem didn't mention it explicitly (the original problem said \"for every integer n\"), but in this case, the problem is phrased as \"if n is greater than 2\", which may implicitly assume n is an integer. However, to be safe, since factorial is involved, n must be a positive integer. So perhaps the assumptions should include that n is a positive integer and n > 2.\n\nWait, the original problem is from Barnard & Child's \"Higher Algebra\", and the user is quoting it as: \"Prove that: If n is greater than 2, then (3n)! is divisible by n! × (n + 1)! × (n + 2)!\".\n\nSo the problem states \"if n is greater than 2\", but doesn't explicitly say n is an integer. However, factorial is only defined for non-negative integers, so n must be an integer. But in the example provided, the assumption included \"n is an integer\" even when the original problem said \"for every integer n\". Wait, no, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", and the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. But in this current problem, the original statement is \"if n is greater than 2\", but factorial implies n is integer. So to mirror the example, perhaps the assumptions should include \"n is an integer\" and \"n is greater than 2\" as two separate points.\n\nHence, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn is greater than 2.\n\nProblem:\nProve that (3n)! is divisible by n! × (n + 1)! × (n + 2)!.\n\nI think that's correct. The user's example split the assumptions into individual lines, each addressing one condition. So even if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", in the example, they listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. Similarly, here, even though the problem says \"if n is greater than 2\", we need to list both that n is an integer and n > 2 as separate assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem should follow that structure.",
