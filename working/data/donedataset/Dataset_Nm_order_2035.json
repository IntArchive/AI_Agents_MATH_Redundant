    "Content": "There are a lots of questions (and several good explanations) on understanding the non-trivial outer automorphism of $S_6$. What I haven't seen, though, is a good explanation of why there are no such outer automorphisms for $n\\neq 6$. Wikipedia makes a passing mention of this fact here . In particular, they have this cryptic claim: For every symmetric group other than $S_6$, there is no other conjugacy class of elements of order 2 with the same number of elements as the class of transpositions. This seems like the natural thing to prove, given the knowledge that you can construct an outer automorphism of $S_6$ which takes transpositions to products of three transpositions (i.e. things like $(12)\\mapsto (12)(34)(56)$.) Also, the second reason Wikipedia gives doesn't feel very intuitive to me. My question, then, is how does one justify the original (quoted) statement above? Here is the naive computation of sizes of conjugacy classes: We need to show that when $n, k\\neq 6,3$\n$$\\frac{n!}{2^k k! (n-2k)!}\\neq\\frac{n!}{2(n-2)!},$$which is equivalent to $$2^k k!(n-2k)!\\neq 2(n-2)!$$ What I want to say is something like, if $n{-}2$ is bigger than $k$, then there is always some factor on the RHS that doesn't appear in the LHS (except when it is a power of two). Will this type of analysis get me anywhere, or is there a better way to think about this?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Yes, as you mention, $S_n$ has $n\\choose2$ transpositions and the conjugacy class whose elements consist of $2\\le k\\le \\frac n2$ disjoint transposition has $\\frac{n!}{(n-2k)!2^kk!}$ elements. As you say, the condition that these numbers are the same is equivalent to\n$$\\tag1 (n-2k)!2^{k-1}k!= (n-2)!$$ For $k=2$ this becomes $4(n-4)!=(n-2)!$ or equivalently $(n-2)(n-3)=4$, which has no integer solution. For $k=3$, we obtain $ 24(n-6)!=(n-2)!$ or equivalently $(n-5)(n-4)(n-3)(n-2)=24$. This has integer solutions $n=6$ and $n=1$, the first leading to the exceptional situation with $S_6$, the other being invalid because it has $n<2k$. For the rest of the argument, we may assume $k>3$.\nThen Bertrand's postulate states that there is a prime $p$  with $k<p<2k-2$. This $p$ does not divide $2^{k-1}k!$ but $n-2\\ge2k-2$ implies that $p$ divides $(n-2)!$ so that we conclude that $p$ divides $(n-2k)!$ and finally that $p\\le n-2k$.\nRewrite (1) as \n$$\\underbrace{2\\cdot2\\cdots 2}_{k-1}\\cdot  \\underbrace{k\\cdot (k-1)\\cdots 2}_{k-1} = \\underbrace{(n-2)(n-3)\\cdots(n-2k+1)}_{2k-2}$$\nEach of the $2k-2$ factors on the left is $\\le k$, each of the $2k-2$ factors on the right is $>p>k$, hence equality cannot hold (as $2k-2\\ne0$).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about justifying why there are no outer automorphisms for symmetric groups S_n when n ≠ 6. The user mentioned a specific statement from Wikipedia regarding conjugacy classes of elements of order 2. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The problem is about symmetric groups S_n where n is not 6. The key assumption here relates to the conjugacy classes of elements of order 2. Specifically, the claim is that for n ≠ 6, there's no conjugacy class of elements of order 2 with the same number of elements as the class of transpositions. \n\nSo, the assumptions would include that n is not 6, that we're considering elements of order 2 in S_n, and that we're comparing the size of the conjugacy class of transpositions to other conjugacy classes of elements of order 2. The problem then is to justify that for n ≠ 6, no other conjugacy class of order 2 elements has the same size as the transpositions' class.\n\nLooking at the user's example, each assumption is a single condition on one object. Here, the main objects are the symmetric group S_n, the integer n, the conjugacy classes of elements of order 2, and the specific sizes of these classes. The problem is to show the inequality of the sizes of these conjugacy classes when n ≠ 6.\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is listed line by line. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The symmetric group in question is S_n where n ≠ 6.\n2. We are considering conjugacy classes of elements of order 2 in S_n.\n3. The conjugacy class of transpositions (which are elements of order 2) has size n(n-1)/2.\n4. Other conjugacy classes of elements of order 2 (like products of k disjoint transpositions) have different sizes.\n5. The problem is to show that for n ≠ 6, these other conjugacy classes do not have the same size as the transpositions' class.\n\nBut wait, maybe some of these points are part of the problem statement rather than assumptions. The original problem is asking how to justify that no other conjugacy class of order 2 elements has the same size as transpositions when n ≠ 6. So the assumptions would be the conditions given in the problem, which are that n ≠ 6 and we're looking at conjugacy classes of elements of order 2 in S_n. The problem then is to prove the inequality of the sizes of these classes.\n\nThe user also mentioned the equation involving factorials which comes from comparing the size of the transpositions' class to another class (probably products of k transpositions). The key equation is 2^k k! (n - 2k)! ≠ 2(n - 2)! when n, k ≠ 6,3. But maybe the exact equation isn't part of the assumptions but part of the problem.\n\nSo, structuring the assumptions:\n\n- S_n is a symmetric group with n ≠ 6.\n- The conjugacy class of transpositions in S_n has size n(n-1)/2.\n- Another conjugacy class of elements of order 2 in S_n consists of products of k disjoint transpositions.\n- The size of this other conjugacy class is given by n! / (2^k k! (n - 2k)!).\n\nBut perhaps the problem is to show that for n ≠ 6, these sizes are unequal. Therefore, the assumptions would be the conditions on n and k, and the problem is to show the inequality.\n\nWait, in the user's example, assumptions are the given conditions in the problem. The original problem here is to justify the statement that for n ≠ 6, there's no conjugacy class of order 2 elements with the same size as transpositions. The user then presents an equation they derived. So the problem, as structured, should capture the need to prove that inequality holds for n ≠ 6, which would imply the conjugacy classes are different sizes.\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\nAssumptions:\n- n is an integer not equal to 6.\n- k is an integer such that the conjugacy class consists of products of k disjoint transpositions.\n- The size of the conjugacy class of transpositions is n(n-1)/2.\n- The size of the conjugacy class of products of k disjoint transpositions is n! / (2^k k! (n - 2k)!).\n\nProblem: Prove that for n ≠ 6 and k ≠ 3, the equation 2^k k! (n - 2k)! ≠ 2(n - 2)! holds, thereby showing the conjugacy classes have different sizes.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is more general, not just for products of k transpositions but for any conjugacy class of order 2 elements. However, the user's equation specifically refers to this case. The original question mentions that the user derived an equation and wants to know if their approach is valid or if there's a better way.\n\nBut according to the user's instruction, I need to filter out unrelated information and structure the problem. The key assumption here is that n ≠ 6 and that we're comparing the sizes of conjugacy classes of elements of order 2 (transpositions vs others). So the problem is to show that for S_n when n ≠ 6, no other conjugacy class of elements of order 2 has the same size as the transpositions.\n\nBut the user's own attempt reduces the problem to showing that 2^k k! (n - 2k)! ≠ 2(n - 2)! when n, k ≠ 6,3. So the problem, as structured, is to prove this inequality.\n\nHence, the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is an integer not equal to 6.\n- k is an integer not equal to 3.\n- The conjugacy class of transpositions in S_n has size n(n-1)/2 = n! / (2(n-2)!).\n- The conjugacy class of products of k disjoint transpositions has size n! / (2^k k! (n - 2k)!).\n\nProblem: Prove that 2^k k! (n - 2k)! ≠ 2(n - 2)! for integers n and k where n ≠ 6 and k ≠ 3.\n\nBut the original question is about justifying the original statement (that no other conjugacy classes have the same size). So maybe the problem should be phrased as proving that for n ≠ 6, there is no conjugacy class of elements of order 2 in S_n with the same number of elements as the class of transpositions. Then the assumptions would be the conditions on n and the elements of order 2.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be to show the inequality as per the user's equation. But since the user wants to structure the problem similarly to their example, I need to see how they did it.\n\nIn their example, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, then the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nIn this case, the original problem's key assumptions are n ≠ 6 and considering conjugacy classes of elements of order 2. The problem is to show that no other conjugacy class has the same size as transpositions. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- S_n is a symmetric group with n ≠ 6.\n- The conjugacy class of transpositions in S_n consists of elements of order 2.\n- Other conjugacy classes of elements of order 2 exist in S_n.\n\nProblem: Prove that no other conjugacy class of elements of order 2 in S_n has the same number of elements as the conjugacy class of transpositions when n ≠ 6.\n\nAlternatively, since the user's own approach reduces it to showing an inequality of factorials, maybe the problem is to prove that equation, which would then imply the conjugacy classes are different sizes. So the assumptions would be n and k are integers, n ≠ 6, k ≠ 3, and the problem is to show the inequality. But I need to check how the user's example was structured. In their example, the assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no, looking at their example:\n\nOriginal problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, they put assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but that seems incorrect. Because the original problem's assumption is that n is any integer. So maybe there was a mistake in their example. But according to their example, perhaps they added a wrong assumption? Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is that n is an integer. Then the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. But in their formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Which is incorrect because the original problem's statement is for any integer n, not just those divisible by 7. Maybe that's a mistake in their example. So maybe I should follow their format, which might have been wrong. But perhaps the user intended that assumptions are all the given conditions. Wait, in the original example, the user formatted the problem as:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut the original problem says \"for every integer n\". So that seems like an error. Maybe they meant to list the problem's conditions. But in that case, the original problem has no assumptions except that n is an integer. But they added n divisible by 7, which is not in the original problem. That suggests that perhaps there's a mistake in their example, but I need to follow their format regardless.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's original question is about justifying that when n ≠ 6, there are no other conjugacy classes of elements of order 2 with the same size as transpositions. The user then reduces it to showing an inequality involving factorials. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- n and k are integers.\n- n ≠ 6.\n- k ≠ 3.\n\nProblem: Prove that 2^k k! (n - 2k)! ≠ 2(n - 2)!.\n\nBut in their example, they included the divisibility condition even though the original problem was for all integers. So maybe in this case, the assumptions include n ≠ 6 and k ≠ 3, and the problem is to prove the inequality. Alternatively, the problem could be the original one about conjugacy classes, with assumptions about n ≠ 6 and elements of order 2.\n\nBut to stick to the user's format, perhaps it's better to capture the key assumptions from the problem statement. The key point from the problem is that for n ≠ 6, there's no other conjugacy class of order 2 elements with the same size as transpositions. The user's approach is to show the inequality of the sizes via factorial equations. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is an integer not equal to 6.\n- The conjugacy class of transpositions in S_n has size n(n-1)/2.\n- A different conjugacy class of elements of order 2 in S_n has size n! / (2^k k! (n - 2k)!)).\n\nProblem: Prove that for integers n ≠ 6 and k, the equation n(n-1)/2 ≠ n! / (2^k k! (n - 2k)!), i.e., 2^k k! (n - 2k)! ≠ 2(n - 2)!.\n\nAlternatively, to make it concise, as the user wrote: \n\nProblem: Prove that when n, k ≠ 6,3, the equation 2^k k! (n - 2k)! ≠ 2(n - 2)! holds.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is an integer not equal to 6.\n- k is an integer not equal to 3.\n\nProblem: Prove that 2^k k! (n - 2k)! ≠ 2(n - 2)!.\n\nBut the user's original question was about justifying the statement from Wikipedia. So maybe the problem should be more about the conjugacy classes rather than the equation. However, since the user provided their own equation and asked about the analysis, perhaps the problem they want structured is the equation part.\n\nTherefore, following the example (even though the example might have incorrect assumptions), the formatted problem would list the assumptions (n is an integer not equal to 6, k is an integer not equal to 3) and the problem is to prove the inequality.\n\nBut perhaps the key assumption is n ≠ 6 and k is an integer. Then the problem is to show that 2^k k! (n - 2k)! ≠ 2(n - 2)! when n ≠ 6 and k ≠ 3.\n\nWait, the user mentioned \"when n, k ≠ 6,3\", so n ≠ 6 and k ≠ 3. So the assumptions are:\n\n- n is an integer and n ≠ 6.\n- k is an integer and k ≠ 3.\n\nProblem: Prove that 2^k k! (n - 2k)! ≠ 2(n - 2)!.\n\nThat seems to align with the user's example, even if the original problem's assumptions were broader. But the user is asking to filter unrelated information and structure the problem as per their format.\n\nSo, final answer:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer not equal to 6,\nk is an integer not equal to 3.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$2^k k! (n - 2k)! \\neq 2(n - 2)!$$.\n\nBut let me check again. The original problem's key points are about S_n with n ≠ 6 and conjugacy classes of elements of order 2. The user reduced it to the equation, considering k (number of transpositions) not equal to 3. So the assumptions include n ≠ 6 and k ≠ 3, and the problem is to show the inequality.
