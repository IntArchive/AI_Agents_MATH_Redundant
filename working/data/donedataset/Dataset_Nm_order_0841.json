    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to format this problem according to the user's specifications. Let's start by reading the original question carefully.\n\nThe problem is: Let a, b, c, d be natural numbers such that ab = cd. Prove that a² + b² + c² + d² is not a prime. The user also mentions that natural numbers are strictly positive, excluding 0.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions line by line, each addressing only one property or condition applied to one object. \n\nThe given conditions are:\n1. a, b, c, d are natural numbers. Since the user specified natural numbers as strictly positive, each of these variables must be at least 1.\n2. The product ab equals cd. That's another condition.\n\nThe problem statement is to prove that the sum of their squares is not a prime number.\n\nWait, but in the example provided, the assumption included both the variables being integers and a specific divisibility condition. Here, the key conditions are that a, b, c, d are natural numbers (positive integers) and ab = cd. So each of these should be separate assumptions. However, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. Wait, the user's example had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. So each assumption is a separate line. \n\nTherefore, for this problem, the assumptions would be:\n- a is a natural number.\n- b is a natural number.\n- c is a natural number.\n- d is a natural number.\n- ab = cd.\n\nWait, but in the example, they combined n being an integer into one line. Wait, the example's original problem was \"for every integer n\", so the assumption was \"n is an integer\", and another assumption \"n is divisible by 7\". But in this case, the problem states that a, b, c, d are natural numbers. So perhaps the first four assumptions can be combined as separate lines: each variable is a natural number. Alternatively, maybe group them? But the example had each assumption on a separate line, even if they apply to different objects. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the assumptions were:\n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\n\nSo each assumption is on a separate line, even though both apply to n. So in this problem, since a, b, c, d are all natural numbers, each would be a separate line. But maybe the user wants to list each variable's condition as separate assumptions. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to list them as a, b, c, d are natural numbers. But the example structured each assumption per line. Wait, the example had two separate assumptions about n. Here, the first assumption is that a, b, c, d are natural numbers. However, the user's format says \"each assumption addresses only one property or condition, applied to one object\". So perhaps each variable must be listed individually. But that would be four separate lines. Alternatively, maybe the first line is \"a, b, c, d are natural numbers\" as a single assumption. But the example separated the two conditions for n into two lines. Hmm.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem stated \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is \"n is an integer\", which is one condition. Then, another assumption is \"n is divisible by 7\", which is another condition. So each condition is separate.\n\nIn the current problem, the natural numbers part is a single condition applied to all four variables. But according to the user's instruction, each assumption should be applied to one object. So maybe each variable is a separate assumption. But that might be redundant. Alternatively, perhaps the first assumption is \"a, b, c, d are natural numbers\" as a single line, and then the second assumption is \"ab = cd\". But the user's example split even two properties of the same object into separate lines. Wait, the example's original problem had \"for every integer n\", so \"n is an integer\" is one assumption. Then the problem in the example had an additional condition that n is divisible by 7. So in that case, each assumption is a separate line even if they apply to the same object.\n\nIn this problem, the original problem states that a, b, c, d are natural numbers. So if we follow the example's structure, perhaps the first four assumptions would be \"a is a natural number\", \"b is a natural number\", etc., each on separate lines. Then the fifth assumption is \"ab = cd\".\n\nBut the user's example didn't list multiple variables. For instance, if the problem had multiple variables, like a and b are integers, would each be a separate line? The example didn't have such a case. Alternatively, maybe grouping is allowed. But the instruction says \"each assumption addresses only one property or condition, applied to one object\". So \"a is a natural number\" is one assumption, \"b is a natural number\" another, and so on. Then \"ab = cd\" is another assumption. That would be five assumptions. But maybe that's too granular. Alternatively, perhaps \"a, b, c, d are natural numbers\" is a single assumption, but the instruction says \"applied to one object\". So maybe each variable is its own assumption. Let me think. The user's example had two assumptions about the same object (n), so each condition on the same object is separate. Therefore, in this case, each variable being a natural number is a separate assumption. Therefore, four assumptions for the variables, then the fifth assumption is ab = cd. So that's five lines under assumptions.\n\nBut the problem's original statement says \"Let a, b, c, d be natural numbers such that ab=cd\". So the conditions are that each is a natural number (positive integer), and ab=cd. So according to the example's structure, each variable's natural number status is a separate assumption? But in the example, it was \"n is an integer\" as one assumption, not multiple. Wait, in the example, the problem was about a single variable n. Here, it's four variables. So perhaps each variable is a separate assumption. Alternatively, perhaps group them: \"a, b, c, d are natural numbers\" as one assumption, and \"ab = cd\" as another. But the user's instruction says \"each assumption addresses only one property or condition, applied to one object\". So if we group a, b, c, d into one line, that's four objects in one assumption. But the instruction says \"applied to one object\". Therefore, perhaps each variable's natural number status must be a separate assumption. However, that seems a bit tedious, but maybe necessary to comply with the format.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's example allowed grouping when the objects are of the same type. For example, if the problem had multiple variables, maybe the assumption is \"a, b, c, d are natural numbers\" as one line. But according to the user's instruction, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So if we say \"a is a natural number\", that's one assumption. Then \"b is a natural number\", etc. So four separate assumptions for each variable, then the fifth assumption is ab=cd.\n\nBut the example given by the user had two assumptions about the same object (n), each on separate lines. So perhaps the same approach here. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\na is a natural number,\nb is a natural number,\nc is a natural number,\nd is a natural number,\nab = cd.\n\nThen the problem is: Prove that a² + b² + c² + d² is not a prime.\n\nBut the original problem says \"natural numbers\" which are strictly positive. So each variable is at least 1. That's important because if any variable were 0, the problem might not hold. But the user's edit specifies that natural numbers are strictly positive, so 0 is excluded. Therefore, each variable is ≥1.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have the assumptions listed as each variable being a natural number, then ab=cd. Then the problem is to prove the sum is not prime.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me check again the example. In the example, the assumptions were n is an integer, and n divisible by 7. The problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. Here, similarly, the assumptions are each variable is natural, and ab=cd, then the problem is the sum is not prime.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption:\na is a natural number,\nb is a natural number,\nc is a natural number,\nd is a natural number,\nab = cd.\nProblem:\nProve that a² + b² + c² + d² is not a prime.",
