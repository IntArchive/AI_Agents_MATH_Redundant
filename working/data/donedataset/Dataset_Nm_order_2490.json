    "AcceptedAnswer": "Your conjecture is correct for $k$ sufficiently large and, almost surely, the only counterexample is the case $k=4$ you have already noted.\nThis inequality is insanely tight: In the end, it comes down to the fact that $e/6 < 1/2$ and some very fortunate coincidences concerning the continued fraction of $e$ . We put $n = \\lfloor k/e \\rfloor$ . We have $$\\left( \\frac{k}{n} \\right)^n < \\left( \\frac{k}{n+1} \\right)^{n+1}$$ if and only if $$(n+1)^{n+1}/n^n < k.$$ We'll set $c=(n+1)^{n+1}/n^n$ . On the other hand, $\\{ k/e \\} > 1/2$ is equivalent to $k/e>n+1/2$ , or $k>e(n+1/2)$ . So your conjecture is $$k> c \\Longleftrightarrow k > e(n+1/2).$$ In other words, if you had a counterexample to your conjecture, there would be an integer $k$ between $c$ and $e(n+1/2)$ . We'll rule this out. To this end, I need to replace $c$ by something more convenient.\nI claim that $e(n+1/2) > c>e (n+1/2-1/(23.9 (n+1/2)))$ for $n \\geq 4$ .\nThis is definitely true for $n$ sufficiently large, as $$c = n \\exp\\left((n+1) \\log\\left(1+\\frac{1}{n}\\right)\\right) = n \\exp\\left((n+1) \\left(\\frac 1 n -\\frac{1}{2n^2} + \\frac{1}{3 n^3}+O\\left(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\right)\\right)\\right)$$ $$= e(n+1/2-1/(24 n) + O(1/n^2))$$ I also checked it for $4 \\leq n \\leq 100$ . I haven't done the careful work of figuring out the constant in the $O()$ to prove this for all $n$ , but you could if you needed to and, if I am wrong, it only introduces finitely many errors. (Here and in the following, you should think of numbers like $23.9$ as \"essentially $24$ \", but I have put in a little fudge to make the inequalities true inequalities rather than asymptotics.) Our goal is to show that there are no solutions to $$e(n+1/2-1/(23.9 (n+1/2))) < k < e(n+1/2)$$ in integers, except for $k=4$ and $n=1$ (as already noted).\nWe can already see that, if there are any solutions, they are rare: you need to get an interval of length $1/(24 n)$ to contain an integer. We will actually see that there aren't any. Applying $x \\mapsto e-x/(n+1/2)$ to each term, this equation is equivalent to: $$\\frac{e}{23.9 (n+1/2)^2} > e-\\frac{2k}{2n+1} > 0$$ or $$\\frac{e}{5.975 (2n+1)^2} > e-\\frac{2k}{2n+1} > 0 \\quad (\\ast).$$ We now remember a theorem about continued fractions (see, for example, Theorem 184 in Hardy and Wright ): If $x$ is irrational and $p$ and $q$ are integers with $$\\left| x - \\frac{p}{q} \\right| < \\frac{1}{2 q^2}$$ then $p/q$ is a convergent of $x$ . Since $e/5.975 < 1/2$ ,  if we had a solution to $(\\ast)$ , then $(2k)/(2n+1)$ would be a convergent of $e$ . (Since convergents grow exponentially fast, this already proves that solutions to $(\\ast)$ are very rare.)\nRoughly, the rest of the proof is as follows: If you look at the convergents $p_i/q_i$ of $e$ and compute $q_i^2 |e-p_i/q_i|$ you'll see that it is approaching $1/2$ for $i \\equiv 1, 3 \\bmod 3$ and going to zero for $i \\equiv 2 \\bmod 3$ . Since $1/2 > e/5.975$ , we don't expect any solutions in the first case. In the second case, it happens that $p_i/q_i$ is of the form $\\mbox{odd}/\\mbox{odd}$ , not $(2k)/(2n+1)$ . The rest of the argument is filling in the details of this. We recall the basic formulas of the theory of continued fractions: If $x = a_0+1/(a_1+1/(a_2+1/(a_3 + \\cdots))) =: [a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3, \\cdots]$ and the convergents of $x$ are $p_1/q_1$ , $p_2/q_2$ , etcetera, than $p_{i+1} = a_i p_i +p_{i-1}$ and $q_{i+1} = a_i q_i + q_{i-1}$ . The continued fraction of $e$ is known: $$e = [2,1,2,1,1,4,1,1,6,1,1,8,1,1,10,1,1,\\cdots].$$ From now on, $a_i$ will denote the sequence $2$ , $1$ , $2$ , $1$ , $1$ , $4$ , etcetera and $p_i/q_i$ will denote the convergents, starting $p_1/q_1=2/1$ , $p_2/q_2 = 3/1$ , $p_3/q_3=8/3$ , $p_4/q_4 = 11/4$ ,  etcetera. (Note that $8/3$ corresponds to $k=4$ , $n=1$ .) From the relations $p_{i+1} = a_i p_i +p_{i-1}$ and $q_{i+1} = a_i q_i + q_{i-1}$ , we check that the parity of $(p_i, q_i)$ repeats with period $6$ . The terms of the form $(2k)/(2n+1)$ are appear in positions that are $1$ or $3$ modulo $6$ , starting $$2, \\ 8/3,\\ 106/39,\\ 1264/465,\\ 25946/9545,\\ 517656/190435, \\cdots$$ I checked the $4$ convergents after $8/3$ explicitly and they did not violate $(\\ast)$ , so I can assume that I am dealing with some quite large numbers if there are any counterexamples. We have the alternating sum $\\left| e-p_i/q_i \\right| = 1/(q_i q_{i+1}) - 1/(q_{i+1} q_{i+2})+ \\cdots$ and thus, in particular, $\\left| e-p_i/q_i \\right| > 1/(q_i q_{i+1}) - 1/(q_{i+1} q_{i+2})$ . In the cases we care about, $e>p_i/q_i$ so we can drop the absolute value. Case 1: $i=1 \\bmod 6$ , like $106/39$ . Note that the denominators surrounding $39$ are $7$ , $32$ , $39$ , $71$ , $495$ . $$\\frac{1}{q_i q_{i+1}} - \\frac{1}{q_{i+1} q_{i+2}} = \\frac{1}{q_i (2 q_{i} - q_{i-2})} - \\frac{1}{q_{i+1} q_{i+2}}.$$ But $q_{i-2}/q_i$ and $q_i/q_{i+2} \\to 0$ as $i \\to \\infty$ while $1 \\bmod 6$ (these are $7/39$ and $39/495$ in the example), so $$q_i^2 \\left(  \\frac{1}{q_i (2 q_{i} - q_{i-2})} - \\frac{1} {q_{i+1} q_{i+2}} \\right) \\to 1/2.$$ Already $i=13$ gets you past $e/5.975$ , so there are no solutions in this case. Case 2: $i \\equiv 3 \\bmod 6$ , like $1264/465$ . Note that the denominators surrounding $465$ are $71$ , $465$ , $536$ , $1001$ . In this case, we have $$\\frac{1}{q_i q_{i+1}} - \\frac{1}{q_{i+1} q_{i+2}} =\\frac{1}{q_i q_{i+1}} - \\frac{1}{q_{i+1}(q_i+ q_{i+1})} = \\frac{1}{q_i (q_i+q_{i+1})} = \\frac{1}{q_i (2 q_i + q_{i-1})}.$$ Again, $q_{i-1}/q_{i} \\to 0$ (this is $71/465$ in the example) so $$q_i^2 \\frac{1}{q_i (2 q_i + q_{i-1})} \\to 1/2.$$ Taking $i=9$ already gets you past $e/5.975$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me start by reading through the original question carefully.\n\nThe user mentions they found a pattern while trying to generalize another problem, but the key here is the current problem they want to solve. The problem is about proving a certain maximum involving floor and ceiling functions related to k divided by e. The main equation is:\n\nFor k in positive integers, k ≠ 4, k ≥ 3, the maximum between two expressions (k divided by floor(k/e) raised to floor(k/e) and k divided by ceil(k/e) raised to ceil(k/e)) is equal to one of them depending on whether the fractional part of k/e is less than 0.5 or greater or equal to 0.5.\n\nFirst, let's list all the assumptions. The user specifies that k is a positive integer, k is not equal to 4, k is greater than or equal to 3. Also, the fractional part of k/e is involved, with a threshold at 0.5. Each assumption should address one property applied to one object.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n1. k is an element of the positive integers (k ∈ ℤ⁺).\n2. k is not equal to 4 (k ≠ 4).\n3. k is greater than or equal to 3 (k ≥ 3).\n4. The fractional part of k/e, denoted {k/e}, is compared to 0.5.\n\nThe problem statement is to prove the given maximum condition based on the fractional part.\n\nWait, the user also mentions that {x} denotes the fractional part of x. So maybe that's another assumption? But since it's a definition, maybe it's part of the problem statement. However, the problem might assume knowledge of fractional part notation. But since the user provided the definition in the edit, perhaps it's better to include it as an assumption to clarify.\n\nBut looking at the example given, the assumption included the conditions on n (integer, divisible by 7). Here, the assumptions are about k: being a positive integer, not 4, at least 3, and the fractional part {k/e} being compared to 0.5. Wait, but the condition on the fractional part is part of the problem's conclusion, not the assumptions. Wait, no. The problem is stating that the maximum is one or the other depending on {k/e} <0.5 or ≥0.5. So the problem's hypothesis is that for k in those specified integers, the maximum is determined by the fractional part of k/e. So the assumptions for the problem would be the conditions on k, and the problem is to prove the max equals the expression based on the fractional part.\n\nSo the assumptions are the constraints on k: k is a positive integer, k ≠4, k ≥3. The problem is to prove the equality where the max is determined by the fractional part of k/e.\n\nTherefore, in the assumption section, each line should list one condition on k. The problem statement is then to prove the given max expression equals the case depending on the fractional part.\n\nSo, let's structure:\n\nAssumption:\n- k is a positive integer (k ∈ ℤ⁺),\n- k ≠ 4,\n- k ≥ 3,\n- {k/e} denotes the fractional part of k/e.\n\nProblem: Prove that for k satisfying the above, the maximum of the two expressions (k/floor(k/e))^{floor(k/e)} and (k/ceil(k/e))^{ceil(k/e)} is equal to the first expression if {k/e} <0.5 and the second if {k/e} ≥0.5.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user writes:\n\nmax{ ... } = { first case if fractional part <0.5, second case otherwise }\n\nSo the problem is to show that equality holds under the given assumptions. So the assumptions are the conditions on k, and the problem is the equation with the cases.\n\nAdditionally, the user defined {x} as fractional part, so perhaps including that in assumptions. But in the example, the assumption included divisibility by 7. So perhaps here, the assumption includes that {k/e} is the fractional part, but maybe that's considered a definition rather than an assumption. Hmm. The example didn't include notation definitions in assumptions. For example, in the original example, the user didn't have to define what 5^n means, because that's standard. Here, the fractional part notation might be considered standard, but the user included an edit explaining it, so perhaps it's safer to include it in the assumptions.\n\nBut in the example, the assumption was about n being integer and divisible by 7, which are conditions on n. Similarly here, the conditions on k are that it's a positive integer, not 4, and ≥3. The fractional part notation is a definition, so maybe not an assumption. But since the user clarified it, perhaps we should note that {x} is the fractional part of x. However, in the example, the problem statement didn't include definitions. The example assumption listed properties of the object (n being integer, divisible by 7). So perhaps here, the assumptions would be:\n\n- k is a positive integer.\n- k is not equal to 4.\n- k is greater than or equal to 3.\n- For real x, {x} denotes the fractional part of x.\n\nBut the last one is a definition, not an assumption on k. Maybe the problem assumes that {x} is known, but since the user defined it, perhaps including it as an assumption is better to be explicit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's structure should have the assumptions only on the variables involved (k here), and the notation is part of the problem statement. But the example didn't include notation definitions in assumptions. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was about proving A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So those are conditions on n, not definitions. So similarly, here, the assumptions should be the conditions on k: being in ℤ⁺, ≠4, ≥3. The definition of {x} is part of the problem statement, maybe mentioned in the problem part.\n\nWait, the problem as stated by the user includes the cases based on {k/e}, which they defined in an edit. So perhaps in the problem statement, we should note that {k/e} is the fractional part. But according to the format, the problem part is just the problem statement. So maybe in the problem part, we can include the definition. However, in the example given, the problem part didn't define 5^n or 6^n; it's assumed. So perhaps here, since the fractional part is part of the problem's condition, it's better to mention it in the problem statement. Alternatively, include it as an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, the assumption could include that {x} denotes the fractional part of x, which is a notation assumption. But perhaps the user's problem is for k in the specified set, and under the notation that {x} is fractional part, the max is equal to one of the cases. So maybe the assumptions should include:\n\n- For real x, {x} denotes the fractional part of x.\n\nBut this is more of a notation clarification. However, in the example, there were no such notations; everything was standard. Here, since the fractional part is crucial and the user explicitly defined it, perhaps including it as an assumption. But I'm not sure if that's considered an assumption about the problem's conditions or just a notation.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to prove the statement given that k meets certain conditions and {x} is defined as fractional part, perhaps the assumptions are the conditions on k, and the problem includes the definition of {x} in the statement. However, according to the user's instructions, the problem part should be just the problem. The example included the problem as \"Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91\", with assumptions on n.\n\nIn the user's problem, the key conditions are on k: k ∈ ℤ⁺, k ≠4, k ≥3. The fractional part notation is part of the problem's context. So perhaps in the assumptions, we list the conditions on k, and in the problem statement, we include the notation as part of the problem. For example:\n\nAssumption:\n- k is a positive integer,\n- k ≠ 4,\n- k ≥ 3.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\max\\left\\{\\left(\\frac{k}{\\lfloor \\frac{k}{\\text{e}}\\rfloor }\\right)^{\\lfloor \\frac{k}{{\\text{e}}}\\rfloor},\\left(\\frac{k}{\\lceil \\frac{k}{\\text{e}}\\rceil }\\right)^{\\lceil \\frac{k}{{\\text{e}}}\\rceil}\\right\\}=\\begin{cases}\\left(\\frac{k}{\\lfloor \\frac{k}{\\text{e}}\\rfloor }\\right)^{\\lfloor \\frac{k}{{\\text{e}}}\\rfloor}\\quad\\text{if}\\ \\{\\frac{k}{\\text{e}}\\}<0.5\\\\ \\\\\\left(\\frac{k}{\\lceil \\frac{k}{\\text{e}}\\rceil }\\right)^{\\lceil \\frac{k}{{\\text{e}}}\\rceil}\\quad\\text{if}\\ \\{\\frac{k}{\\text{e}}\\}\\ge 0.5\\end{cases}$$ where $\\{x\\}$ denotes the fractional part of $x$.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the problem part doesn't include any extra explanations; the assumptions are listed separately. So maybe the definition of {x} should be in the assumptions. However, since {x} is a notation, not a condition on k. The example didn't have to define any notation in assumptions. So perhaps it's better to keep assumptions as the conditions on k, and in the problem statement, we can include the definition of {x} parenthetically.\n\nAlternatively, the user included in their problem statement an edit explaining {x}, so to mirror that, in the formatted problem, we can add that {x} denotes the fractional part in the problem statement. For example:\n\nProblem: Prove that [...] where {x} denotes the fractional part of x.\n\nBut the user's original problem had that explanation in an edit, so perhaps it's part of the problem's requirements. Therefore, to structure properly, we include the fractional part definition in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, since in mathematical problems, fractional part is standard notation, but given that the user felt the need to explain it, maybe it's safer to include it as an assumption. However, assumptions are supposed to be conditions or properties of the objects involved (like k here). The notation {x} is more of a definition, not an assumption on k.\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous, but following the example's structure, where assumptions were only about the variables (n being integer, divisible by 7), perhaps here the assumptions are only about k:\n\n- k is a positive integer,\n- k ≠ 4,\n- k ≥ 3.\n\nAnd in the problem statement, we can mention that {x} denotes the fractional part of x. But the original user's problem statement included the definition in an edit, so perhaps it's part of the problem. Therefore, the problem should include the definition.\n\nAlternatively, since in the example, the problem statement didn't include any such definitions, but the user's original problem here does, so it's part of the problem's text. Therefore, the problem statement should have the definition.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- k is a positive integer,\n- k ≠ 4,\n- k ≥ 3.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\max\\left\\{\\left(\\frac{k}{\\lfloor \\frac{k}{\\text{e}}\\rfloor }\\right)^{\\lfloor \\frac{k}{{\\text{e}}}\\rfloor},\\left(\\frac{k}{\\lceil \\frac{k}{\\text{e}}\\rceil }\\right)^{\\lceil \\frac{k}{{\\text{e}}}\\rceil}\\right\\}=\\begin{cases}\\left(\\frac{k}{\\lfloor \\frac{k}{\\text{e}}\\rfloor }\\right)^{\\lfloor \\frac{k}{{\\text{e}}}\\rfloor}\\quad\\text{if}\\ \\{\\frac{k}{\\text{e}}\\}<0.5\\\\ \\\\\\left(\\frac{k}{\\lceil \\frac{k}{\\text{e}}\\rceil }\\right)^{\\lceil \\frac{k}{{\\text{e}}}\\rceil}\\quad\\text{if}\\ \\{\\frac{k}{\\text{e}}\\}\\ge 0.5\\end{cases}$$ where $\\{x\\}$ denotes the fractional part of $x$.\n\nBut in the original user's problem, the fractional part definition was given in an edit, so it's part of the problem's statement, hence included here.\n\nSo, checking again:\n\nAssumptions list the conditions on k: being a positive integer, not 4, and at least 3. The problem is to prove the maximum equals the case depending on the fractional part of k/e, with the definition of {x} included in the problem statement.\n\nYes, that seems to align with the example. The example's assumptions were about n's properties (integer, divisible by 7), and the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. Similarly here, assumptions on k, and problem is to prove the max expression with the fractional part defined.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem should be as above.",
