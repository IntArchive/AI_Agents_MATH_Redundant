    "Content": "I have this exercise involving the axiom of choice, but I don't understand where it's needed: Let $(X_i)_{i \\in I}$ and $(Y_i)_{i \\in I}$ be pairwise disjoint sets with $|X_i| = |Y_i|$. Prove, using the axiom of choice, that $$ \\mid\\bigcup_{i \\in I} X_i\\mid = \\mid\\bigcup_{i \\in I} Y_i\\mid.$$\nI assume that this just means that you have to prove that there exists a bijection between $\\mid\\bigcup_{i \\in I} X_i\\mid$ and $\\mid\\bigcup_{i \\in I} Y_i\\mid$, which I think is almost trivial, but I don't understand where the axiom of choice (or another form of it) is needed. I also have the same question involving products (without the pairwise disjoint union statement): prove that, given that $|X_i| = |Y_i|$, $$ \\mid\\prod_{i \\in I} X_i\\mid = \\mid\\prod_{i \\in I} Y_i\\mid.$$\nAgain, I don't understand why the axiom of choice is needed, since finding a bijection is trivial and, if axiom of choice doesn't hold, the two products are empty and the equality follows trivially. What am I missing here ?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Suppose $A$ and $B$ are two sets of equal cardinalities, without any additional structure there are $2^{|A|}$ many bijections between them. Using the axiom of choice we can choose $f_i\\colon X_i\\to Y_i$ which is a bijection, and using these bijections construct one from $\\bigcup X_i$ to $\\bigcup Y_i$ in the intuitive manner that you'd expect. However since we are choosing from infinitely many sets at once we cannot just say that the sequence of bijections exists. Such assertion needs to be backed up, and the axiom of choice is exactly what allows us to back it up - the collections of bijections are nonempty, and so we may choose one from each one. From these choices we have a sequence of bijections which we can use to construct the bijection between the unions. Without the axiom of choice it is possible that we cannot choose the bijections. It is possible to have that $A_i$ is countable for $i\\in\\omega$ but $|\\bigcup A_i|=\\aleph_1$, which is of course uncountable. By your argument we could say that $A_i$ has a bijection with $\\{i\\}\\times\\omega$, however $\\bigcup A_i$ is uncountable while $\\bigcup(\\{i\\}\\times\\omega)=\\omega\\times\\omega$ is countable. Therefore the unions are no longer in bijection. Wait, it gets even worse. It is possible to have a countable family of disjoint pairs (sets of two elements each), and the union of is uncountable. Of course the uncountability of the union does not imply it has cardinality $\\aleph_1$, but rather that it cannot be well ordered at all. On the other hand, we can write $\\mathbb Z\\setminus\\{0\\}$ as the pairs $\\{-n,n\\}$. The union of these countably many pairs is indeed countable. With products the use of choice is even clearer. It is not trivial that the product is nonempty, but it does not imply that every product is empty. In the above example of the pairs, we have countably many disjoint pairs $P_i$ such that $\\prod P_i=\\varnothing$. However if you take pairs of natural numbers, for example $\\{2n,2n+1\\}$ then the product is $2^\\omega$ and the union is countable. This, once again, should hint you of the example. So to answer both questions, the point we use the axiom of choice is in our choice of bijections to construct the bijection between the products or the unions. Of course this can be averted if additional structure exists on the sets, if they are all subsets of the same well ordering, for example.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user is asking about why the Axiom of Choice (AC) is needed in two specific cases: one involving the union of disjoint sets and another involving the product of sets. They mentioned that they think constructing a bijection is trivial and don't see where AC comes into play. Let me start by breaking down each part of their question.\n\nFirst, for the union case: We have two families of sets, $(X_i)_{i \\in I}$ and $(Y_i)_{i \\in I}$, both pairwise disjoint, and each $X_i$ has the same cardinality as $Y_i$. The goal is to show that the cardinality of their unions is equal. The user thinks creating a bijection between the unions is straightforward. But where does AC come in?\n\nWell, if each $X_i$ and $Y_i$ are in bijection, then for each $i$, there exists a bijection $f_i: X_i \\to Y_i$. To construct a bijection between the unions, we would need to \"collect\" all these individual bijections into a single function. However, in the absence of AC, we can't necessarily form the set of all $f_i$ unless we have a choice function that selects each bijection. Even if there's at least one bijection for each $i$, we might need AC to ensure we can choose one for every $i$ simultaneously. Without AC, it's possible that no such collection exists, even though each individual bijection does. So the problem might be in the need to choose a bijection for each $i$, which requires AC when $I$ is infinite.\n\nNow, for the product case: We need to show that the cardinality of the product of the $X_i$s equals that of the $Y_i$s, given each $X_i$ and $Y_i$ have the same cardinality. The user's confusion is that if AC doesn't hold, both products might be empty, making their cardinalities equal (both zero). But wait, if even one $X_i$ is empty, then the product is empty. However, the problem states $|X_i| = |Y_i|$, so if one is empty, the other must be too. But even if all are non-empty, without AC, the products could be empty. However, if AC fails, the products might not be empty, but just not \"choosable\". Hmm, maybe the issue is more subtle. \n\nIn the case where AC doesn't hold, the products might not have a choice function, but the existence of a bijection between the products would still require that you can uniformly biject each $X_i$ to $Y_i$, then lift that to the product. But again, selecting a bijection for each $i$ would need AC. So even if the products are non-empty, constructing the bijection between them might require AC. For example, if each $X_i$ and $Y_i$ have two elements, you can have a bijection by swapping or not, but without AC, you can't choose a bijection for each $i$, so you can't construct the overall bijection between the products. Hence, AC is needed here as well.\n\nSo, the key in both cases is that even though individual bijections exist between each $X_i$ and $Y_i$, assembling them into a global bijection requires the Axiom of Choice when the index set $I$ is infinite. Without AC, such a collection of bijections might not exist, making the proof dependent on AC.\n\nNow, structuring the problem according to the given format. The original problem mentions two parts: one about unions and one about products. But the user is asking about both. However, the example given in the user's previous structure had only one problem, but here there are two. But since the user's instruction says to structure \"the problem\" as per the format, maybe we need to handle each part separately. However, the original question includes both parts. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nOriginal problem statement includes two parts: first, the union part, then the product part. The user's confusion is about both. But the example given by the user had a single problem. So perhaps the structured problem should capture both parts? Wait, the example given by the user only addressed one problem. But in the original problem here, there are two separate statements. However, the user's own example had a problem with multiple parts but structured them into one. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and in the formatted problem, they listed the assumptions (n is integer, n divisible by 7) and the problem. But in this current problem, the user is presenting two separate exercises: one about unions and one about products. However, the problem statement as given in the title and question includes both. So perhaps the correct approach is to structure each as a separate problem. However, the user's example combines multiple parts into one. Wait, let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem lists assumptions (n is integer, n divisible by 7) and the problem statement. So in that case, the problem is a single problem. Here, the original problem from Math Stack Exchange includes two parts: unions and products. So should we split them into two separate problems? Or list them both under the same problem? The user's answer in the example included a single problem. However, the original problem here mentions both parts, so maybe we need to capture both in the problem statement. Let me check the original problem text again:\n\n\"Let $(X_i)_{i \\in I}$ and $(Y_i)_{i \\in I}$ be pairwise disjoint sets with $|X_i| = |Y_i|$. Prove, using the axiom of choice, that $$ \\mid\\bigcup_{i \\in I} X_i\\mid = \\mid\\bigcup_{i \\in I} Y_i\\mid.$$ I assume that this just means that you have to prove that there exists a bijection between $\\mid\\bigcup_{i \\in I} X_i\\mid$ and $\\mid\\bigcup_{i \\in I} Y_i\\mid$, which I think is almost trivial, but I don't understand where the axiom of choice (or another form of it) is needed. I also have the same question involving products (without the pairwise disjoint union statement): prove that, given that $|X_i| = |Y_i|$, $$ \\mid\\prod_{i \\in I} X_i\\mid = \\mid\\prod_{i \\in I} Y_i\\mid.$$ Again, I don't understand why the axiom of choice is needed...\"\n\nSo the user presents two separate problems: one about unions and one about products. But the original problem includes both. However, in the formatting example, the user's example had a single problem. To adhere to the format, perhaps we need to structure each problem separately. But the user's instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\", implying per problem. Since the original post includes two distinct problems (unions and products), each requiring the use of AC, perhaps we should present each as a separate problem. However, the example provided by the user combined multiple conditions into one problem. Alternatively, maybe treat the entire post as one problem with two parts, but the format requires one problem per entry. The user might need to split them, but according to the given instructions, perhaps the assistant should structure each problem separately.\n\nBut the original problem is presented as one question with two parts, so maybe the formatted problem should include both parts. But the example given by the user had a single problem. However, the original user's example had only one problem. So maybe the answer should split them into two separate formatted problems. However, given that the user's example combines multiple conditions into one problem, perhaps the answer here should list both problems under the same \"Problem\" section. Alternatively, maybe structure each as a separate problem. The user's instruction says \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format\". Since the original question includes two problems (unions and products), perhaps each should be structured separately. But the user's example had a single problem. To resolve this, maybe combine them into one problem statement with two parts. But the original problem in the example was a single statement. Alternatively, perhaps present them as two separate problems. However, the user's answer should follow the format where each problem is structured with assumptions and problem. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to split them into two separate problem entries. However, the user's original question is one post with both parts, so maybe the formatted problem includes both. Let me check the user's instruction again.\n\nThe user says: \"structure that problem as the following format. You will be given some example which I structured before.\" The example given was a single problem. Therefore, perhaps the user expects each Math Stack Exchange question to be structured as one entry, even if it contains multiple parts. Therefore, in this case, the problem statement would include both parts. However, the assumptions might differ for each part. For example, in the first part (unions), the families are pairwise disjoint, but in the second part (products), there's no such condition. So the assumptions would be different for each part. Therefore, perhaps the answer should list both problems under the same \"Problem\" section, each with their own assumptions. But the given format only allows one \"Assumption\" block and one \"Problem\" block. Therefore, to comply with the format, perhaps we need to treat each part as a separate problem. However, the user's original post is a single question with two parts. Alternatively, maybe we can list multiple assumptions and the problem includes both parts. But the example's \"Assumption\" lists multiple conditions applicable to a single problem. Therefore, in this case, since the two parts have different conditions (pairwise disjoint for unions, no such for products), perhaps we need to structure them as two separate problems. But the user hasn't provided an example of multiple problems. Alternatively, maybe the problem statement can mention both parts, and the assumptions list the conditions for each part. Wait, the format requires \"Assumption: <All the assumptions... applied to one object>\" which suggests per problem. Therefore, perhaps each problem must be structured separately. Thus, given the original question includes two separate problems, the assistant should format them each as individual problems. However, the user's original question is a single post, but perhaps the assistant should present them as two separate formatted problems. However, the user's example didn't do that. Alternatively, perhaps the assistant should capture both parts in the problem statement, with the assumptions covering both. But since each part has different conditions, that might not work. The first problem has pairwise disjoint sets, the second does not. Therefore, the assumptions for the first problem would include that the sets are pairwise disjoint, while the second does not. Therefore, to accurately reflect the problem, they should be structured separately. However, the original post is a single question. Therefore, the answer should present both as separate problems under the same question. But according to the format provided, each problem is structured individually. Therefore, perhaps the answer should structure each part as a separate problem. However, since the user's instruction might not clarify this, but the example treats one problem as one entry, maybe the answer here should present each part as a separate formatted problem. Alternatively, perhaps the answer should list both parts under the same problem statement, noting the different assumptions. But given the format example, perhaps the correct approach is to split them into two separate entries. However, given the user's answer example, perhaps not. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original problem is considered as two separate problems, so the formatted answer should have two entries. However, the user's example didn't do this. Alternatively, given the user's original example only had one problem, maybe the assistant should process each part as a separate problem. But the user might expect both parts to be included. Alternatively, perhaps the answer should list both problems under the same \"Problem\" section, separated appropriately, and include the different assumptions. Let me attempt that.\n\nFirst problem:\nAssumption: \n- $(X_i)_{i \\in I}$ and $(Y_i)_{i \\in I}$ are pairwise disjoint families of sets.\n- For each $i \\in I$, $|X_i| = |Y_i|$.\nProblem: Prove that $\\left| \\bigcup_{i \\in I} X_i \\right| = \\left| \\bigcup_{i \\in I} Y_i \\right|$ using the axiom of choice.\n\nSecond problem:\nAssumption:\n- For each $i \\in I$, $|X_i| = |Y_i|$.\nProblem: Prove that $\\left| \\prod_{i \\in I} X_i \\right| = \\left| \\prod_{i \\in I} Y_i \\right|$ using the axiom of choice.\n\nBut according to the format, each problem should have its own Assumption and Problem sections. Therefore, if the user's original question contains two separate problems, they should each be formatted individually. However, the user's example had one problem. Therefore, maybe the answer should present each part as a separate formatted problem. The user's instruction allows for that. So in the answer, there would be two formatted problems.\n\nBut since the user's original post includes both, but the example is single-problem, perhaps the answer should present them as two separate formatted problems. Therefore, the assistant should structure each part as a separate problem. However, the user's answer example includes only one problem. To adhere strictly, perhaps the answer should list both problems under one entry, but that might not fit the format. Alternatively, given the user's instruction, maybe each part is a separate problem. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe original question is titled \"Axiom of choice: cardinality of general disjoint union\" and includes two parts: one about unions and one about products. So perhaps the main problem is about the unions, and the second part is an additional question. However, the user is asking about both. Therefore, the formatted answer should include both parts, each as their own problem with respective assumptions. Hence, the assistant should generate two formatted problems. However, the user's example didn't have that. Given the user's instruction to follow the format, and since the example only had one problem, perhaps the answer should only address the first part (the union problem) mentioned in the title. But the user's question includes both. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's intention is to have each problem structured separately. So for the first problem (unions), the assumptions are pairwise disjoint, and for the second (products), no such assumption. So each gets their own entry. However, the original question is one post. But according to the user's instruction, each problem should be structured according to the format. Therefore, perhaps the answer should include two formatted problems. However, the user's example didn't have multiple problems. But since the user's original question includes two separate parts, maybe each should be formatted. Therefore, proceeding under that assumption.\n\nFirst formatted problem:\nAssumption:\n- $(X_i)_{i \\in I}$ is a pairwise disjoint family of sets.\n- $(Y_i)_{i \\in I}$ is a pairwise disjoint family of sets.\n- For each $i \\in I$, $|X_i| = |Y_i|$.\nProblem: Prove that $\\left| \\bigcup_{i \\in I} X_i \\right| = \\left| \\bigcup_{i \\in I} Y_i \\right|$ using the axiom of choice.\n\nSecond formatted problem:\nAssumption:\n- For each $i \\in I$, $|X_i| = |Y_i|$.\nProblem: Prove that $\\left| \\prod_{i \\in I} X_i \\right| = \\left| \\prod_{i \\in I} Y_i \\right|$ using the axiom of choice.\n\nBut in the original problem, the user mentions that for the products, there is no pairwise disjoint condition. So the assumptions for the product problem do not include pairwise disjointness. Therefore, the second problem's assumptions are only the cardinality condition. This seems accurate. Therefore, the answer should present both formatted problems. However, the user's example didn't have multiple problems. But given the original question's content, this seems necessary. Therefore, the assistant's answer should present both.",
