    "Content": "This is out of my textbook, Axler's \"Linear Algebra Done Right\" which I am self-studying from. ( I organized my thoughts in which I would like some sort of response with Roman Numerals ). Linear Dependence Lemma : If $(v_{1},\\ldots,v_{m})$ is linearly dependent in $V$ and $v_{1} \\neq 0$, then there exists $j \\in \\{2,\\ldots,m\\}$ such that the following hold: (a) $v_{j} \\in span(v_{1},\\ldots,v_{j-1})$; ( I. Why does this need to be justified? Is it because $v_{j}$ is an \"extra\" vector, which would make this arbitrary set of linear combinations dependent?). (b) If the $j^{th}$ term is removed from $(v_{1},\\ldots,v_{m})$, the span of the remaining list equal $span(v_{1},\\ldots,v_{m})$. ( II. My assumption is that this basically means that if we remove this extra vector, then we still have the same list of linear combinations). (I also found the following proof a bit confusing and need some clarification). PROOF: Suppose $(v_{1},\\ldots,v_{m})$ is linearly dependent in $V$ and $v_{1} \\neq 0$. Then there exists $a_{1},\\ldots,a_{m} \\in \\mathbb{F}$, not all $0$ such that $$a_{1}v_{1}+\\cdots+a_{m}v_{m} = 0$$. (So far so good, from what I know, this is just stating the opposite of Linear Independence, where the only choice of $a_{1},\\ldots,a_{m} \\in \\mathbb{F}$ that satisfies $a_{1}v_{1}+\\cdots+a_{m}v_{m} = 0$  is $a_1 =\\cdots= a_{m} = 0$) CONT: Not all of $a_{2},a_{3},\\ldots,a_{m}$ can be $0$ (because $v_1 \\neq 0)$. Let $j$ be the largest element of $\\{2,\\ldots.,m\\}$ such that $a_{j} \\neq 0$. Then  $$ v_{j} = -\\frac{a_1}{a_j}v_1 - \\cdots - \\frac{a_{j-1}}{a_j}v_{j-1} ,$$ proving (a). ( III. I will fill in the extra steps here because I feel that I may have the right idea). $Span(v_{1},\\ldots,v_{m}) = 0$ for $j \\in \\{2,\\ldots,m\\} = a_{1}v_{1} + \\cdots + a_{j}v_{j} = 0$. Here I just solved for $v_j$, and got the result  $v_{j} = -\\frac{a_1}{a_j}v_1 - \\cdots - \\frac{a_{j-1}}{a_j}v_{j-1} ,$ which corresponds to the above. $a_{j} \\neq 0$ because we have $a_j^{-1}$ for each term, and $v_1 \\neq 0$ because if we have $a_{1}v_{1}+\\cdots+a_{j}v_{j} = 0$ then all the scalars $a_{2},\\ldots,a_{m} \\in \\mathbb{F}$ could be equal to $0$, if that was the case. I think I have an idea, but how exactly does this prove that $v_j$ is contained in the span of $(v_{1},\\ldots,v_{j-1})$? Is it because $ -\\frac{a_1}{a_j}v_1 - \\cdots - \\frac{a_{j-1}}{a_j}v_{j-1}$, is just a linear combination of vectors that is equal to $v_j$? CONT: to prove (b), suppose that $u \\in span(v_{1},\\ldots,v_{m})$. Then there exists $c_{1},\\ldots,c_m \\in \\mathbb{F}$ such that $$u = c_1v_1 + \\cdots + c_mv_m$$. In the equation above, we replace $v_j$ with the right side of 2.5, which shows that $u$ is in the span of the list obtained by removing the $j^{th}$ term from $(v_1,\\ldots,v_m)$. Thus (b) holds. $\\Box$ ( IV. So how exactly does this work? I find this part the most confusing). Sorry that this is such a long list, but I really want to fully understand everything I am learning, and I am pretty new to proving stuff, so I want to make sure that I improve that skill as well.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I. Why does (a) need to be justified Because every claim made needs to be. The essence of (a) is that if there is a linear dependence, then there is a specific index $j$ such that the blame of linear dependence can be given to $v_j$, for its failing to be independent of its predecessors. A different way to prove this is to consider the list of sequences $()$, $(v_1)$, $(v_1,v_2)$, $\\ldots$, $(v_1,v_2,\\ldots,v_m)$; since the first one is linearly independent and the last one is linearly dependent (by assumption) there must be a first one in the list the is linearly dependent; if this is $(v_1,\\ldots,v_j)$ then one can show $v_j\\in span(v_1,\\ldots,v_{-1})$. The argument is similar to the proof given in the text (a linear dependence relation among $(v_1,\\ldots,v_j)$ must involve $v_j$ with nonzero coefficient). An advantage of this approach is that it does not depend essentially on any choice (the linear dependency taken is unique up to a scalar multiple) and it puts the blame on the very first $v_j$ that causes linear dependence. II. My assumption is that (b) basically means that if we remove this extra vector, then we still have the same list of linear combinations. More precisely, the removal of $v_j$ does not affect the set of vectors that can be written as linear combinations, even though the linear combinations themselves look different (since $v_j$ is no longer allowed to appear). III. I will fill in... $span(v_{1},\\ldots,v_{m}) = 0$ for $j \\in \\{2,\\ldots,m\\} = a_{1}v_{1} + \\cdots + a_{j}v_{j} = 0$.\n  Here I just solved for $v_j$, and got the result  $v_j = -\\frac{a_1}{a_j}v_1 - \\cdots - \\frac{a_{j-1}}{a_j}v_{j-1} ,$ which corresponds to the above. $a_{j} \\neq 0$ because we have $a_j^{-1}$ for each term, You've got that a bit backwards. You could only solve for $v_j$ under the assumption $a_j\\neq0$; you cannot conclude that from the fact that you just solved for $v_j$. and $v_1 \\neq 0$ because if we have $a_{1}v_{1}+\\cdots+a_{j}v_{j} = 0$ then all the scalars $a_{2},\\ldots,a_{m} \\in \\mathbb{F}$ could be equal to $0$, if that was the case. This is doubly beside the point. $v_1\\neq0$ is given, you don't need to prove that. On the other hand there is nothing absurd in the scalars $a_{2},\\ldots,a_{m} \\in \\mathbb{F}$ all being equal to $0$, except that the text had just proved it is not the case using the fact that $v_1\\neq0$. But the author could have avoided the whole mess about $v_1$ by observing that $span()=\\{0\\}$. I think I have an idea, but how exactly does this prove that $v_j$ is contained in the span of $(v_{1},\\ldots,v_{j-1})$? Is it because $ -\\frac{a_1}{a_j}v_1 - \\cdots - \\frac{a_{j-1}}{a_j}v_{j-1}$, is just a linear combination of vectors that is equal to $v_j$? Precisely. In the equation above, we replace $v_j$ with the right side of 2.5, which shows that $u$ is in the span of the list obtained by removing the $j^{th}$ term from $(v_1,\\ldots,v_m)$. Thus (b) holds. $\\Box$ IV. So how exactly does this work? If you write down a linear combination of $v_1,\\ldots,v_m$ it contains a single occurrence of $v_j$. If you replace that occurrence (within parentheses, as it gets multiplied by a scalar) by the right hand side of 2.5, then there is no longer any occurrence of $v_j$. You don't directly get a linear combination of the remaining $v_i$, but once you work out the multiplication and collect like terms, you do get such a linear combination. For instance if $v_3=-5v_1+\\frac32v_2$ then\n$$\\begin{align}\n  av_1+bv_2+cv_3+dv_4\n&= av_1+bv_2+c(-5v_1+\\frac32v_2)+dv_4\n\\\\&= av_1+bv_2-5cv_1+\\frac32cv_2+dv_4\n\\\\&= (a-5c)v_1+(b+\\frac32c)v_2+dv_4.\n\\end{align}\n$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the task is to prove the Linear Dependence Lemma from Axler's book. The lemma states that if a list of vectors (v₁, ..., vₘ) is linearly dependent and v₁ is not the zero vector, then there exists some index j ≥ 2 such that (a) vⱼ is in the span of the previous vectors v₁, ..., vⱼ₋₁, and (b) removing vⱼ doesn't change the span of the entire list.\n\nFirst, let me recall what linear dependence means. A list of vectors is linearly dependent if there exists a non-trivial linear combination of them that equals zero. That is, there are scalars a₁, ..., aₘ, not all zero, such that a₁v₁ + ... + aₘvₘ = 0. The problem also specifies that v₁ ≠ 0, so at least one scalar in the combination must be non-zero. However, the user mentions that not all of a₂, ..., aₘ can be zero. Wait, why is that? If v₁ ≠ 0, then if all a₂, ..., aₘ were zero, we would have a₁v₁ = 0, which would force a₁ to be zero because v₁ is non-zero. But that would mean all scalars are zero, contradicting the linear dependence. Therefore, at least one of a₂, ..., aₘ must be non-zero.\n\nNow, the proof chooses the largest j in {2, ..., m} such that aⱼ ≠ 0. Why the largest j? Let me think. By choosing the largest such j, we ensure that when we express vⱼ as a combination of previous vectors, we don't have to worry about any vectors after vⱼ because their coefficients are zero. This makes sense because if there were a non-zero coefficient after j, then j wouldn't be the largest. So, all coefficients a_{j+1}, ..., aₘ must be zero. Therefore, the equation simplifies to a₁v₁ + ... + aⱼvⱼ = 0. Since aⱼ ≠ 0, we can solve for vⱼ: vⱼ = (-a₁/aⱼ)v₁ - ... - (a_{j-1}/aⱼ)v_{j-1}. This shows that vⱼ is indeed in the span of the previous vectors, which is part (a) of the lemma.\n\nFor part (b), we need to show that removing vⱼ doesn't change the span. The span of the original list includes all linear combinations of v₁, ..., vₘ. If we remove vⱼ, we need to show that any vector in the original span can still be expressed without vⱼ. Since vⱼ is a linear combination of the previous vectors, any occurrence of vⱼ in a linear combination can be replaced by that combination of v₁ to v_{j-1}. Therefore, the span remains the same. The user's question in part IV seems to be about how exactly substituting vⱼ in the equation works. Let me see: if u is in the span of all vectors, then u can be written with coefficients c₁ to cₘ. If we replace vⱼ with its expression in terms of the previous vectors, then the terms involving vⱼ (i.e., cⱼvⱼ) can be rewritten using the previous vectors, so u is expressed without vⱼ. Hence, the span without vⱼ is the same.\n\nThe user also had some specific questions labeled with Roman numerals. For instance, part I asks why (a) needs to be justified. I think it's because even though we know the list is dependent, we need to formally show that a specific vector (vⱼ) can be expressed as a combination of the previous ones. It's not immediately obvious which vector it is, so the justification is necessary. Part II seems to be understanding that removing the redundant vector (vⱼ) doesn't reduce the span, which is correct.\n\nIn summary, the key steps are: using linear dependence to get a non-trivial combination, selecting the last non-zero coefficient to express vⱼ in terms of earlier vectors, and then showing that removing vⱼ doesn't affect the span because it's already in the span of the remaining vectors.",
