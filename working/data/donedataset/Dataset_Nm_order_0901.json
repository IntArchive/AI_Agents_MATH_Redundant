    "Content": "I was doing a consistency check for some calculations I'm performing for my master thesis (roughly - about a problem in discrete bayesian model selection) - and it turns out that my choice of priors is only consistent if this identity is true: $$\\sum_{k=0}^{N}\\left[ \\binom{k+j}{j}\\binom{N-k+j}{j}\\right] = \\binom{N+2j+1}{2j+1}$$ Now, this seems to work for small numbers, but I searched for it a lot in the literature and I can't find it.(I have a physics background so probably my knowledge of proper \"literature\" is the problem here). Neither I can demonstrate it!\nHas anyone of you seen this before? Can this be rewritten equivalently in some more commonly seen way? Can it be proven right...or wrong?\nThanks in advance! :)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Your identity is correct. I don't know a reference offhand, but here is a proof. The right side, $\\binom{N+2j+1}{2j+1}$ , is the number of bitstrings of length $N+2j+1$ consisting of $N$ zeroes and $2j+1$ ones. The sum on the left counts the same set of bitstrings. Namely, for $0\\le k\\le N$ , the term $\\binom{k+j}j\\binom{N-k+j}j$ is the number of those bitstrings in which the middle one, with $j$ ones on either side, is in the $k+j+1^\\text{st}$ position; i.e., it has $k$ zeroes and $j$ ones to the left, $N-k$ zeroes and $j$ ones to the right. P.S. I found your identity in László Lovász, Combinatorial Problems and Exercises , North-Holland, 1979 (the first edition), where it is Exercise 1.42(i) on p. 18, with hint on p. 96 and solution on p. 172. Lovász gives the identity in the following (more general) form: $$\\sum_{k=0}^m\\binom{u+k}k\\binom{v-k}{m-k}=\\binom{u+v+1}m.$$ If we set $m=N$ , $u=j$ , $v=N+j$ , this becomes $$\\sum_{k=0}^N\\binom{j+k}k\\binom{N+j-k}{N-k}=\\binom{N+2j+1}N$$ which is plainly equivalent to your identity $$\\sum_{k=0}^N\\binom{k+j}j\\binom{N-k+j}j=\\binom{N+2j+1}{2j+1}.$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. The user has presented a combinatorial identity and is asking for verification, references, or a proof. The identity is:\n\n$$\\sum_{k=0}^{N}\\left[ \\binom{k+j}{j}\\binom{N-k+j}{j}\\right] = \\binom{N+2j+1}{2j+1}$$\n\nFirst, I need to check if this identity is correct for some small values. Let me test with j=0. Then the left-hand side (LHS) becomes:\n\n$$\\sum_{k=0}^{N} \\binom{k}{0}\\binom{N-k}{0} = \\sum_{k=0}^{N} 1 \\times 1 = N+1$$\n\nThe right-hand side (RHS) would be:\n\n$$\\binom{N+1}{1} = N+1$$\n\nSo it works for j=0. Let's try j=1 and N=1. Then LHS is:\n\n$$\\sum_{k=0}^{1} \\binom{k+1}{1}\\binom{1 -k +1}{1}$$\n\nFor k=0: binom(1,1)*binom(2,1) = 1*2 = 2\n\nFor k=1: binom(2,1)*binom(1,1) = 2*1 = 2\n\nSum is 4. RHS is binom(1 + 2*1 +1, 2*1 +1) = binom(4,3)=4. Correct.\n\nAnother test: j=1, N=2. LHS:\n\nk=0: binom(1,1)*binom(3,1)=1*3=3\n\nk=1: binom(2,1)*binom(2,1)=2*2=4\n\nk=2: binom(3,1)*binom(1,1)=3*1=3\n\nTotal sum: 3+4+3=10\n\nRHS: binom(2+2*1+1, 3)=binom(5,3)=10. Correct.\n\nSeems to hold for small numbers. Now, the user wants to know if this identity is known, how to prove it, or if it's incorrect.\n\nLooking for known identities. The sum resembles a convolution of binomial coefficients. The form is similar to Vandermonde's identity but not exactly the same. Alternatively, perhaps using generating functions or combinatorial interpretations.\n\nFirst, let's recall that the binomial coefficient $\\binom{k+j}{j}$ is the number of ways to choose j elements from k+j, which is the same as the number of multisets of size j from a set of size k+1 (stars and bars). Similarly, $\\binom{N -k +j}{j}$ is similar.\n\nAlternatively, thinking combinatorially: suppose we have to choose 2j+1 elements from a set of size N+2j+1. How can this relate to the sum over k of products of binomial coefficients?\n\nAlternatively, consider the generating functions. Let’s denote $C_j(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{k+j}{j} x^k = \\frac{1}{(1-x)^{j+1}}$. Then the generating function for the product $\\binom{k+j}{j}\\binom{N -k +j}{j}$ would be the coefficient of $x^N$ in the product $C_j(x) \\cdot C_j(x)$, which is $\\frac{1}{(1-x)^{2j+2}}}$. But the coefficient of $x^N$ there is $\\binom{N + 2j +1}{2j +1}$, which matches the RHS. Wait, that seems promising.\n\nWait, let's check. If we have two generating functions $\\frac{1}{(1-x)^{j+1}}$ each, their product is $\\frac{1}{(1-x)^{2j+2}}}$. The coefficient of $x^N$ in this product is $\\binom{N + 2j +1}{2j +1}$, which is exactly the RHS. But the sum on the LHS is $\\sum_{k=0}^N \\binom{k+j}{j}\\binom{N -k +j}{j}$, which is the same as the coefficient of $x^N$ in the product of the two generating functions. Hence, the identity holds by the convolution of coefficients in generating functions. Therefore, the identity is a direct consequence of the generating function multiplication.\n\nTherefore, the identity is correct and can be proven using generating functions. Alternatively, a combinatorial argument could be constructed by interpreting both sides as counting the same set.\n\nThe user might not be familiar with generating functions, so explaining in terms of generating functions would be a good approach. Also, since they mentioned literature, perhaps this identity is a form of the Vandermonde convolution but for symmetric sums or a specific case of a more general identity. However, I think the generating function approach is the most straightforward here.",
