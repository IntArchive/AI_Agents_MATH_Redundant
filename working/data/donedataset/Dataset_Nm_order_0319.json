    "Content": "I am looking for nice ways of proving the divergence of the sequence $\\left\\{x_n\\right\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ defined by\n$$x_n=\\sin{(n)}.$$\nOne (not so nice) way is to construct two subsequences: one where the indexes are picked such that they lie in the intervals \n$$I_k=\\left(\\dfrac{\\pi}{6}+2\\pi(k-1),\\dfrac{5\\pi}{6}+2\\pi(k-1)\\right)$$\nand one where they lie in\n$$J_k=\\left(\\dfrac{7\\pi}{6}+2\\pi(k-1),\\dfrac{11\\pi}{6}+2\\pi(k-1)\\right).$$\nIf ${x_n}$ converges, then all its subsequences must converge to the same limit, but here the first subsequence has all its values in the interval $\\left[ \\frac{1}{2}, 1\\right]$ while the second has its values in $\\left[-1,-\\frac{1}{2}\\right]$. Contradiction. Filling the details of this proof is rather tedious and not very elegant. Anyone has a better idea?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Equidistribution argument is very elegant, but it becomes a sledgehammer method when it comes to a question of mere convergence. A simple argument can reveal the divergence of $(\\sin n, n \\geq 1)$. Let $$ (x_n, y_n) = (\\cos n, \\sin n)$$ (I changed the notation for the sake of consistency of notation.) Then the application of the addition formula for trigonometric function or the rotation matrix gives $$ \\begin{align*}\nx_{n+1} &= x_n \\cos 1 - y_n \\sin 1 \\\\\ny_{n+1} &= x_n \\sin 1 + y_n \\cos 1.\n\\end{align*} $$ Now assume $(y_n)$ converges. Then since $\\sin 1 \\neq 0$, we have $$ x_{n+1} = (y_{n+1} - y_n \\cos 1) \\cot 1 - y_n \\sin 1$$ and hence $(x_n)$ also converges. Now let $(x_n, y_n) \\to (\\alpha, \\beta)$. Then taking limit to the recursive formula we have $$ \\begin{align*}\n\\alpha &= \\alpha \\cos 1 - \\beta \\sin 1 \\\\\n\\beta &= \\alpha \\sin 1 + \\beta \\cos 1.\n\\end{align*} $$ Solving this system of linear equations give $(\\alpha, \\beta) = (0, 0)$. On the other hand, since $$ x_n^2 + y_n^2 = 1, $$ we must have $$ \\alpha^2 + \\beta^2 = 1,$$ a contradiction! Therefore $(y_n)$ cannot converge. //// Of course, we can say much more on $(y_n)$. For example, we can show that the set of limit points of $(y_n)$ is exactly $[-1, 1]$, and the Cesaro mean of $(y_n)$ is 0 from Weyl's criterion. (This proof is from the book Problems in Real Analysis Advanced Calculus on the Real Axis .)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about proving the divergence of the sequence {sin(n)} from n=1 to infinity. \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem defines the sequence as x_n = sin(n). So the first assumption is that the sequence is defined by x_n = sin(n). The user mentions that n is an integer starting from 1 and going to infinity. Wait, in the example given, the assumption included that n is an integer and that it's divisible by 7. Here, n is a positive integer, but there's no divisibility condition. So the first assumption should be that n is a positive integer. Also, the sequence is built using sine of integers. \n\nBut wait, the problem statement doesn't add any other conditions on n. The original problem is just about the sequence sin(n). So the assumptions would be:\n\n- The sequence is defined by x_n = sin(n) for each positive integer n.\n- The problem considers the limit as n approaches infinity.\n\nWait, but in the example, they listed each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So here, the main objects are the sequence and the terms of the sequence. The first assumption is that the sequence is {x_n} where x_n = sin(n). The second assumption might be that n ranges over positive integers. But maybe the user considers that n being an integer is part of the problem's inherent setup, so maybe just one assumption: \"The sequence is defined by x_n = sin(n) for each positive integer n.\" But in the example, they split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So perhaps here, the key assumption is that n is a positive integer, and x_n is defined as sin(n). Wait, but in the problem statement, the user is talking about the sequence {sin(n)}, so maybe the assumption is simply that n is a positive integer. Because sin(n) is applied to integers n.\n\nBut the example included two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Here, the problem doesn't have the divisibility condition. So the assumptions here would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nThe sequence is defined by x_n = sin(n).\n\nBut maybe the problem statement doesn't require any additional conditions beyond n being a positive integer, so the assumptions are:\n\n- n is a positive integer,\n- The sequence is {x_n} where each term x_n = sin(n).\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption is one line, addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So here, the first assumption is that n is a positive integer. The second assumption is that the sequence is defined by x_n = sin(n). Then the problem is to prove that this sequence diverges.\n\nWait, but the original problem is \"Prove the divergence of the sequence {sin(n)}.\" So the problem statement is clear. The user is asking for help in proving that. The example in the original question had two assumptions, but in this case, the main assumption is that n is a positive integer, and the sequence is sin(n). There's no additional condition like divisibility, unless the user's approach in the question implies something else. However, the user's own approach involves constructing subsequences in intervals around multiples of 2π, but that's part of their attempted proof, not an assumption of the problem.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nThe sequence is defined by x_n = sin(n).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the sequence {x_n} diverges.\n\nWait, but in the example, the problem was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" with assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But here, the problem's assumptions are n is a positive integer, and the sequence is defined as sin(n). But maybe the key point is that the problem is about the sequence sin(n) where n runs through positive integers. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nx_n = sin(n) for each n.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the sequence {x_n} diverges.\n\nAlternatively, maybe n being a positive integer is considered part of the problem statement, not an assumption. But according to the example, assumptions include n being an integer and divisible by 7. So in that example, the problem's original statement was for every integer n, but the formatted assumption included n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the example, the user must have structured the problem by filtering out unrelated information. Wait, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem's assumption was n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the example's original problem had a mistake. Let me check.\n\nOriginal problem example: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem's assumption says n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems contradictory. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Unless the user intended to structure a different problem. Wait, perhaps there was a miscommunication in the example. Maybe the original problem had an extra condition that n is divisible by 7, but the user included that in the assumptions. Hmm, perhaps the example is flawed. But regardless, the task is to structure the given problem into Assumption and Problem parts.\n\nFor the current problem, the user's question is about proving divergence of the sequence sin(n). The key assumptions here are that n is a positive integer and the sequence is defined by x_n = sin(n). There are no additional constraints given in the problem, so the assumptions should include these two points. The problem is to prove divergence. Therefore, the formatted answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nn is a positive integer,\nThe sequence is defined by x_n = sin(n).\nProblem:\nProve that the sequence $\\left\\{ \\sin(n) \\right\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ diverges.",
