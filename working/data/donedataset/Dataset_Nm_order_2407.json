    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this integral problem. The user wants me to structure the problem according to the specified format. The original question is about proving that the integral from 0 to 1 of 1 over (1 + x^sqrt(2))^sqrt(2) dx equals a certain gamma function expression. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The problem mentions integrating from 0 to 1, so the limits are fixed. The integrand is 1 divided by (1 + x^{sqrt(2)})^{sqrt(2)}. The exponent sqrt(2) is specified here, and the result is given in terms of gamma functions. The user also mentions that Mathematica confirms this both symbolically and numerically. \n\nLooking at the example provided, assumptions are listed as separate lines, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. In the example, n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the integral is from 0 to 1, so the variable x is integrated over [0,1]. The integrand's form is specific: (1 + x^{\\sqrt{2}})^{-\\sqrt{2}}. So maybe the assumptions are about the limits of integration and the form of the integrand. \n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and that it's divisible by 7. But here, maybe the assumptions are just the integral's bounds and the structure of the integrand. However, the problem doesn't state any conditions on x except that it's the variable of integration between 0 and 1. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The integral is from 0 to 1.\n- The integrand is 1/(1 + x^{sqrt{2}})^{sqrt{2}}.\n\nBut each assumption should address only one property. So splitting them into two lines. Also, the exponents are sqrt(2), which is an algebraic number but not a rational number. The problem mentions that this result is interesting because other algebraic powers don't give such nice answers except trivial cases. So maybe the key assumptions here are the specific exponents sqrt(2) in both the base and the exponent of the denominator.\n\nSo structuring the assumptions as:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is over the interval [0, 1],\nThe integrand is (1 + x^{\\sqrt{2}})^{-\\sqrt{2}}.\n\nProblem:\nProve that\n$${\\large\\int}_0^1\\frac{dx}{(1+x^{\\sqrt2})^{\\sqrt2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt\\pi}{2^{\\sqrt2}\\sqrt2}\\cdot\\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac1{\\sqrt2}\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac12+\\frac1{\\sqrt2}\\right)}.$$\n\nWait, but in the original example, the assumption included specific conditions on n. Here, the problem is to prove the equality of the integral to the gamma expression. The key here is the structure of the integrand and the interval. There's no additional condition like n being an integer or divisible by something unless specified. The original problem doesn't state any extra conditions beyond the integral's form.\n\nSo the main assumptions are the interval [0,1] and the integrand's form with exponents sqrt(2). Therefore, the formatted problem should have those two assumptions.",
