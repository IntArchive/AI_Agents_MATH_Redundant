    "Content": "I'm studying measure theory, and I came across a theorem that says that, given two $\\sigma$-finite measure spaces $\\left(X,\\mathcal M,\\mu\\right)$ and $\\left(Y,\\mathcal N,\\nu\\right)$, and a set $E\\in \\mathcal M\\otimes\\mathcal N$, the function $x\\mapsto \\nu\\left(E_x\\right)$ is measurable. The definition of the product-$\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal M\\otimes\\mathcal N$ is the $\\sigma$-algebra generated by the rectangles $A\\times B$ with $A\\in\\mathcal M$ and $B\\in\\mathcal N$.

    "AcceptedAnswer": "Since the map $u_{x}:Y\\to X\\times Y$ given by $u_x(y)=(x,y)$ for a given $x$ is $\\mathcal{N}$-$(\\mathcal{M}\\otimes\\mathcal{N})$-measurable and $E_x=u_x^{-1}(E)$ it follows directly that $E_x\\in\\mathcal{N}$ for any $x$.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this question. The user is studying measure theory and came across a theorem about sections of measurable sets in the product sigma-algebra. Their main issue is understanding why, given a set E in the product sigma-algebra M⊗N, the sections E_x are measurable in N for all x. \n\nFirst, the original problem mentions two sigma-finite measure spaces (X, M, μ) and (Y, N, ν). The product sigma-algebra M⊗N is generated by rectangles A×B where A is in M and B is in N. A section E_x is defined as {y in Y : (x,y) ∈ E}. The theorem says that the function x ↦ ν(E_x) is measurable, but the user is stuck on a more basic point: why is E_x itself in N for every x?\n\nThe user is confused because they can't see why E_x would be measurable. They mention something about unitary sets being measurable, but they don't think that's necessary. Even if {x} is in M, they can't prove E_x ∈ N.\n\nSo, the problem here is to show that for any E in M⊗N, every section E_x is in N. The assumptions would be the given measure spaces are sigma-finite, E is in the product sigma-algebra, and sections are defined as usual. But wait, the theorem statement in the question already assumes sigma-finiteness, but the user's specific problem is about E_x being in N regardless of that. Wait, the theorem uses sigma-finiteness for the function x ↦ ν(E_x) being measurable, but maybe the section E_x being in N is a more general result that doesn't require sigma-finiteness?\n\nBut the user is working within the context of the theorem, which does have sigma-finite measure spaces. However, the problem of E_x being in N might not depend on sigma-finiteness. Let me recall: the product sigma-algebra is generated by the rectangles. To show that all sections of E in M⊗N are measurable, one approach is to use the fact that the collection of sets E for which all sections E_x are in N is a sigma-algebra containing the rectangles. Since the product sigma-algebra is the smallest such, this collection must include all of M⊗N.\n\nSo, the key steps would be: 1. Show that for rectangles A×B, the section E_x is either B (if x ∈ A) or empty (if x ∉ A), both of which are in N. 2. Show that the collection of sets E where all sections E_x are measurable is closed under complements and countable unions/intersections. Therefore, since it contains the generating sets, it's the entire product sigma-algebra.\n\nTherefore, the user's problem is to prove that for any E ∈ M⊗N, E_x ∈ N for all x ∈ X. The assumptions would be that (X, M, μ) and (Y, N, ν) are measure spaces (sigma-finiteness might not be needed here), E is in the product sigma-algebra M⊗N, and sections are defined as E_x = {y : (x,y) ∈ E}.\n\nBut in the original question, the user mentions that they can't prove E_x ∈ N even assuming {x} ∈ M. Wait, but in general measure spaces, singleton sets might not be measurable. However, in the product sigma-algebra, the sections don't require {x} to be measurable. Instead, the argument is about fixing x and looking at E_x, which can be shown by using the good set principle: the set of all E in M⊗N where E_x is in N for all x is a sigma-algebra containing the rectangles. Therefore, the conclusion holds without needing singletons to be measurable.\n\nSo the problem's assumptions should include that (X, M) and (Y, N) are measurable spaces (no measures needed for this particular statement), and E is in M⊗N. The problem is to prove that for every x ∈ X, E_x ∈ N.\n\nBut in the original question, the user is referring to the theorem where the measure spaces are sigma-finite, but the specific part about E_x being measurable in N might not require sigma-finiteness. So perhaps the sigma-finiteness is a red herring here, and the actual assumptions are just that M and N are sigma-algebras, and E is in the product sigma-algebra.\n\nTherefore, in the formatted problem, the assumptions should list the measurable spaces, the product sigma-algebra, the definition of sections, and E being in the product sigma-algebra. The problem is to show that each section E_x is in N.\n\nWait, but the user's original problem statement includes the setup of the theorem, which mentions sigma-finite measure spaces. However, their specific question is about the sections being measurable, which may not require the measure spaces to be sigma-finite. So perhaps the sigma-finiteness is part of the original theorem's context but not necessary for this particular problem. However, the user is asking within that context, so maybe we should include sigma-finiteness as part of the assumptions even if it's not needed. But since the user is stuck on E_x being in N regardless of sigma-finiteness, perhaps the correct approach is to not include sigma-finiteness in the assumptions for this particular problem. Wait, the problem as posed by the user is: \"given E ∈ M⊗N, why is E_x ∈ N for all x?\" So the key assumptions are:\n\n- (X, M) and (Y, N) are measurable spaces (sigma-algebras)\n- E is in the product sigma-algebra M⊗N (generated by rectangles A×B where A ∈ M, B ∈ N)\n- The section E_x is defined as {y ∈ Y : (x,y) ∈ E}\n\nAnd the problem is to show that for every x ∈ X, E_x ∈ N.\n\nSo the sigma-finiteness of the measure spaces is part of the theorem they mentioned, but the specific question about sections doesn't depend on measures being sigma-finite or even on the measures at all. It's purely a question about the structure of the product sigma-algebra.\n\nTherefore, when structuring the problem, the assumptions should list the measurable spaces, E being in the product sigma-algebra, and the definition of sections. The problem is to prove that each section is measurable.",
