    "Content": "I am looking for a proof of the following identity, very relevant for evaluating certain binomial sums $\\pmod{p}$ : $$ \\sum_{k=1}^{n}\\binom{2k}{k}\\frac{1}{k} = \\frac{2n+1}{3}\\binom{2n}{n}\\sum_{k=1}^{n}\\frac{1}{k^2\\binom{n}{k}^2} \\tag{1}$$ It is due to Tor B. Staver, Om summasjon av potenser av binomialkoeffisienten, Norsk Mat.\nTidsskrift 29 (1947) , but I did not manage to get access to the original article. I have attempted a few things, so far unsuccessfully: A) Exploit $$ \\sum_{k=0}^{n}\\frac{\\lambda^k}{\\binom{n}{k}}=(n+1)\\sum_{r=0}^{n}\\frac{\\lambda^{n+1}+\\lambda^{n-r}}{(r+1)(1+\\lambda)^{n-r+1}}\\tag{A}$$ which holds for any $\\lambda > -1$ , as shown by Bala Sury through Euler's Beta function. B) Exploit a partial fraction decomposition of the reciprocal squared binomial coefficient, namely $$ \\frac{1}{k^2\\binom{n}{k}^2} = \\sum_{r=0}^{k-1}\\frac{\\binom{k-1}{r}^2}{(n-r)^2}+2\\sum_{r=0}^{k-1}\\frac{\\binom{k-1}{r}^2}{(n-r)}(H_{k-1-r}-H_{r-1}) \\tag{B}$$ C) Exploit the Beta function and symmetry in order to get $$ \\sum_{k=1}^{n}\\frac{1}{k^2\\binom{n}{k}^2}=\\frac{1}{4^n n!^2}\\iint_{(-1,1)^2}\\frac{(1+x+y+xy)^{n+1}-(1+xy)^{n+1}}{x+y}\\,dx\\,dy \\tag{C}$$ D) Apply Wilf's snake oil method, proving that the LHS and the RHS of (1) have the same OGF. Quite clearly $$ \\sum_{k=1}^{n}\\binom{2k}{k}\\frac{1}{k} = 2[z^n]\\frac{\\log(2)-\\log(1+\\sqrt{1-4z})}{1-z}.\\tag{D}$$ E) I am also able to show through the Beta function that $$\\begin{eqnarray*} \\sum_{r=0}^{n}\\frac{1}{\\binom{n}{r}^2}&=&2\\frac{(n+1)^2}{(n+2)}\\sum_{r=0}^{n}\\frac{1}{(n-r+1)\\binom{n+r+2}{r}}\\\\&=&2\\frac{(n+1)^2}{(n+2)}[z^{n+1}]\\left(-\\log(1-z)\\cdot\\phantom{}_2 F_1\\left(1,1;n+3;x\\right)\\right)\\\\&=&\n2(n+1)^2 [z^{2n+3}](1-z)^{n+1}\\left(\\log(1-z)-\\log^2(1-z)\\right)\\tag{E}\\end{eqnarray*}$$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Denote $$F(k,n) = \\frac{1}{k^2 \\binom{n}{k}^2} \\qquad G(k,n) = \\binom{2k}{k}\\frac{1}{k} \\frac{3}{2n+1}\\binom{2n}{n}^{-1}$$ $$S(n) = \\sum_{k=1}^n F(n,k) \\qquad T(n) = \\sum_{k=1}^n G(n,k)$$ let's show $S=T$ by showing they satisfy same recurrence (plus some trivial checks on initial conditions). Recurrence for $T$ is easy. Note that $$(-n-1) G(k,n)+2 (2 n+3) G(k,1+n) = 0$$ summing this over $k$ from $1$ to $n$ gives $$(-n-1) T(n)+2 (2n+3) (T(1+n)-G(n+1,n+1)) = 0$$ that is $$(-n-1)T(n) + 2(2n+3) T(n+1) = \\frac{6}{n+1}$$ On the other hand , one checks, with $R(k,n) = \\frac{(2 k-3 n-5) (-k+n+1)^2}{(n+1)^2}$ , $$\\tag{*}(-n-1) F(k,n)+2 (2 n+3) F(k,1+n)=F(k+1,n) R(k+1,n) -F(k,n) R(k,n)$$ note that RHS telescopes in $k$ . Summing over $k$ from $1$ to $n-1$ , $$(-n-1)(S(n)-\\frac{1}{n^2}) + 2(2n+3) (S(n+1)-\\frac{1}{(n+1)^2} - \\frac{1}{n^2(n+1)^2}) = F(n,n)R(n,n)-F(1,n)R(1,n)$$ which rearranges into $$(-n-1)S(n) + 2(2n+3) S(n+1) = \\frac{6}{n+1}$$ QED.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question according to the specified structure. The original problem is about proving Staver's identity, which relates two sums involving binomial coefficients.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The example provided listed assumptions as properties or conditions applied to one object each. Looking at the problem, the identity is supposed to hold for any positive integer n, I think. The question mentions evaluating binomial sums modulo p, but the problem itself doesn't specify any particular modulo condition—it's a general identity. So maybe there are no explicit assumptions here beyond n being a positive integer? Wait, the left-hand side is a sum from k=1 to n, so n must be at least 1. That's an assumption. Also, the problem is about proving the identity, so maybe the key assumption is that n is a positive integer. Let me check the original problem again. The user mentions it's relevant for evaluating binomial sums mod p, but the identity itself doesn't have modulo in it. So the main assumption is that n is a positive integer.\n\nSo the Assumption section should list that n is a positive integer. Maybe each assumption is a separate line, but here there's only one assumption. Then the Problem section is the identity itself. Let me check the example again. In the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. But here, there's no divisibility condition mentioned. The problem is general for any n. Therefore, the only assumption is that n is a positive integer.\n\nNow, structuring the problem. The problem is to prove the given identity. The user provided an example where the problem was to prove divisibility. Here, it's proving the equality between two sums. So the formatted problem should state the identity as the problem to prove. Let me check the user's example again. The problem line starts with \"Prove that...\" followed by the expression. So in this case, the problem line should be \"Prove that [the identity]\".\n\nTherefore, the Assumption is that n is a positive integer, and the Problem is to prove the given equality. The other details in the original question, like the attempts and references to methods, are part of the user's thought process but not part of the problem's assumptions. The key is to filter out the unrelated information. The original problem's title and the equation (1) are the core. The rest are the user's attempts and context, which should be excluded from the formatted problem.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{n}\\binom{2k}{k}\\frac{1}{k} = \\frac{2n+1}{3}\\binom{2n}{n}\\sum_{k=1}^{n}\\frac{1}{k^2\\binom{n}{k}^2}.\n$$\n\nI think that's it. The key is to extract the main identity and the condition on n. The problem doesn't specify any other constraints, so the assumption is just n being a positive integer. The rest of the user's attempts (A to E) are their own strategies and not part of the problem statement.",
