    "Content": "I am trying to derive the vorticity equation and I got stuck when trying to prove the following relation using index notation:\n$$\n{\\rm curl}((\\textbf{u}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{u}) = (\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\nabla)\\pmb\\omega - ( \\pmb\\omega \\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{u}\n$$\nconsidering that the fluid is incompressible $\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{u} = 0 $, $\\pmb \\omega = {\\rm curl}(\\mathbf{u})$ and that $\\nabla \\cdot \\pmb \\omega = 0.$ Here follows what I've done so far:\n$$\n(\\textbf{u}\\cdot\\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = u_m\\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial x_m} \\mathbf{e}_i  = a_i  \\mathbf{e}_i \\\\\n{\\rm curl}(\\mathbf{a}) = \\epsilon_{ijk} \\frac{\\partial a_k}{\\partial x_j} \\mathbf{e}_i = \\epsilon_{ijk} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j}\\left( u_m\\frac{\\partial u_k}{\\partial x_m} \\right) \\mathbf{e}_i = \\\\\n= \\epsilon_{ijk}\\frac{\\partial u_m}{\\partial x_j}\\frac{\\partial u_k}{\\partial x_m}  \\mathbf{e}_i + \\epsilon_{ijk}u_m \\frac{\\partial^2u_k}{\\partial x_j \\partial x_m} \\mathbf{e}_i    \\\\\n$$ the second term $\\epsilon_{ijk}u_m \\frac{\\partial^2u_k}{\\partial x_j \\partial x_m} \\mathbf{e}_i$ seems to be the first term \"$(\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\nabla)\\pmb\\omega$\" from the forementioned identity. Does anyone have an idea  how to get the second term?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The trick is the following: $$ \\epsilon_{ijk} \\frac{\\partial u_m}{\\partial x_j} \\frac{\\partial u_m}{\\partial x_k} = 0 $$ by antisymmetry. So you can rewrite $$ \\epsilon_{ijk} \\frac{\\partial u_m}{\\partial x_j} \\frac{\\partial u_k}{\\partial x_m} = \\epsilon_{ijk} \\frac{\\partial u_m}{\\partial x_j}\\left( \\frac{\\partial u_k}{\\partial x_m} - \\frac{\\partial u_m}{\\partial x_k} \\right) $$ Note that the term in the parentheses is something like $\\pm\\epsilon_{kml} \\omega_l$ Lastly use the product property for Levi-Civita symbols $$ \\epsilon_{ijk}\\epsilon_{lmk} = \\delta_{il}\\delta_{jm} - \\delta_{im}\\delta_{jl} $$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to format this problem according to the given structure. The original question is about deriving the vorticity equation using index notation, specifically proving a certain curl identity. Let me parse through the details.\n\nFirst, the assumptions. The problem mentions that the fluid is incompressible, so ∇·u = 0. Then, ω is the curl of u, so ω = curl(u). Also, it's stated that ∇·ω = 0. These are the main conditions given. The problem is to prove that the curl of (u·∇)u equals (u·∇)ω - (ω·∇)u.\n\nLooking at the example provided, each assumption is a single condition applied to one object. So I need to list each assumption separately. The problem statement should then be the identity they want to prove, without the extra details about their attempts.\n\nWait, in the example, they included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. Here, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The fluid is incompressible (∇·u = 0)\n- ω is the curl of u (ω = curl(u))\n- ∇·ω = 0\n\nEach of these is a separate condition on different objects: the fluid's velocity field u, the vorticity ω, etc. So each should be a bullet point in assumptions.\n\nThe problem is the curl identity given. So the formatted problem should have those three assumptions and then the problem statement as proving that identity.",
