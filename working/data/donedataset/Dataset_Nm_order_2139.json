    "Content": "This is an exercise in Hatcher, section 4.3, exercise 3, page 419, on which I'm struggling. Suppose that a CW complex X contains a subcomplex $S^1$ such that the inclusion\n  $S^1 \\hookrightarrow X$ induces an injection $H_1(S^1;\\mathbb Z) \\to H_1(X; \\mathbb Z)$ with image a direct summand of $H_1(X;\\mathbb Z)$. Show that $S^1$ is a retract of $X$. I've been trying to use obstruction theory to solve this, but I'm stuck. Showing that $S^1$ is a retract is equivalent to showing there is a map $r : X \\to S^1$ extending the identity $id : S^1 \\to S^1$. By obstruction theory ($S^1$ is an abelian space, we can assume $X$ is connected), we need to consider groups of the form $H^n(X, S^1; \\pi_{n-1}(S^1))$. The only nonzero such group is $H^2(X, S^1)$ (with integer coefficients). Let $H_1(X) = H_1(S^1) \\oplus M$. The long exact sequence in homology gives an exact sequence: $0 \\to H_2(X) \\to H_2(X, S^1) \\to H_1(S^1) \\to H_1(X) \\to H_1(X, S^1) \\to 0$ Thanks to the hypothesis on $H_1$, we therefore have that $H_2(X) \\simeq H_2(X, S^1)$ and $H_1(X, S^1) \\simeq M$. By universal coefficients: $$\\begin{align}\nH^2(X, S^1) & \\simeq \\mathrm{Hom}(H_2(X,S^1), \\mathbb Z) \\oplus \\mathrm{Ext}(H_1(X,S^1), \\mathbb Z) \\\\\n& \\simeq \\mathrm{Hom}(H_2(X), \\mathbb Z) \\oplus \\mathrm{Ext}(M, \\mathbb Z) \\oplus \\mathrm{Ext}(\\mathbb Z, \\mathbb Z)\\\\\n& \\simeq \\mathrm{Hom}(H_2(X), \\mathbb Z) \\oplus \\mathrm{Ext}(H_1(X), \\mathbb Z) \\\\\n& \\simeq H^2(X)\n\\end{align}$$ And this is where I'm stuck. There's an obstruction $\\omega_2(id) \\in H^2(X, S^1; \\pi_1(S^1)) \\simeq H^2(X)$, and I'd like to show that it's zero, but I don't know how. Could you give me some insight?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "EDIT: Sorry, I forgot the initial step of the argument.  Your calculation shows that the map $H^2(X,S^1;\\pi_1 S^1) \\to H^2(X;\\pi_1 S^1)$ is an isomorphism.  This means that the obstruction cocycle for constructing a map extending the one on $S^1$ is zero precisely when the obstruction cocycle for an unconstrained map, and it suffices to show that the latter is always zero. Roughly, this particular obstruction is always zero, because this obstruction cocycle only depends on an existing choice of map from the $0$-skeleton. More in detail.  Obstruction cocycles answer particular questions.  Given a map from the $s$-skeleton of $X$ to $Y$, we have such an obstruction cocycle measuring whether it's possible (given a current choice of map on the $(s-1)$-skeleton) to make some choice of maps on the $s$-cells to get a map which can be extended to the $(s+1)$-skeleton.  This is the obstruction that lives in $H^{s+1}(X, \\pi_s Y)$, roughly because it's asking about whether the attaching maps for the $(s+1)$-cells can be made nullhomotopic in $Y$. In your case, $s=1$.  You can take whatever map $X^{(0)} \\to S^1$ that you are given and lift it up to a map $X^{(0)} \\to \\mathbb{R}$, and all such maps automatically have an extension to a map $X^{(2)} \\to \\mathbb{R} \\to S^1$. This pattern continues for Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces: the obstruction cocycle for a map $X \\to K(G,n)$ depends only on a map from the $(n-1)$-skeleton, and all the maps from the $(n-1)$-skeleton to a $K(G,n)$ are nullhomotopic.  The obstruction cocycle is then the same as that for a constant map.  You only tend to get interesting obstructions when you've had the opportunity to make interesting choices on the lower skeleta.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let's try to parse this problem. The user is referring to an exercise from Hatcher's Algebraic Topology, specifically section 4.3, exercise 3 on page 419. The problem statement is about showing that if a CW complex X contains a subcomplex S¹ (a circle) such that the inclusion map induces an injection on the first homology group H₁ with integer coefficients, and the image is a direct summand of H₁(X), then S¹ is a retract of X. \n\nThe user attempted to use obstruction theory. They mention that showing S¹ is a retract is equivalent to finding a map r: X → S¹ extending the identity on S¹. They considered obstruction theory, noting that S¹ is an abelian space (which might relate to Eilenberg-MacLane spaces?) and assumed X is connected. The obstruction lies in H²(X, S¹; π₁(S¹)), which is H²(X, S¹; ℤ) since π₁(S¹) is ℤ. They computed some homology and cohomology groups using the long exact sequence and universal coefficient theorem, leading them to H²(X, S¹) being isomorphic to H²(X). The obstruction ω₂(id) is in this group, and they need to show it's zero.\n\nFirst, I need to structure this problem according to the given format. The assumptions should list each condition on the objects involved. Let's see:\n\n1. X is a CW complex.\n2. S¹ is a subcomplex of X.\n3. The inclusion i: S¹ ↪ X induces an injection on H₁ with ℤ coefficients.\n4. The image of H₁(S¹) in H₁(X) is a direct summand.\n5. We need to show S¹ is a retract of X.\n\nThe problem statement is to show that under these conditions, S¹ is a retract of X. The user's approach via obstruction theory is part of their attempt, but the formatted problem should exclude their specific method and just present the core problem and assumptions.\n\nWait, in the example provided, the assumption included specific conditions like n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the key assumptions are about X being a CW complex containing S¹ as a subcomplex, the inclusion inducing an injective H₁ with image a direct summand. So each of these should be separate assumptions.\n\nProblem statement: Show that S¹ is a retract of X.\n\nSo, in the formatted problem, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a CW complex,\nS¹ is a subcomplex of X,\nThe inclusion S¹ ↪ X induces an injection H₁(S¹; ℤ) → H₁(X; ℤ),\nThe image of H₁(S¹; ℤ) in H₁(X; ℤ) is a direct summand.\n\nProblem:\nShow that S¹ is a retract of X.\n\nThe user's own approach with obstruction theory and the computations are part of their attempt, but according to the example, the formatted problem should filter out the solution attempt and just present the problem and its assumptions. So the key is to extract the problem's given conditions and state them as assumptions, then the problem itself.\n\nI need to ensure that each assumption is a single condition applied to one object. So each bullet point addresses one condition. Let's check:\n\n- X is a CW complex: one condition on X.\n- S¹ is a subcomplex of X: another condition on X and S¹.\n- The inclusion induces an injection on H₁: this is a condition on the inclusion map.\n- The image is a direct summand: a condition on the structure of H₁(X).\n\nYes, each of these is a separate assumption. The problem is to show the retraction exists. So the formatted problem should be as above.\n\nThe user's own steps about obstruction theory, the long exact sequence, universal coefficients, etc., are part of their attempt and should not be included in the formatted problem. The task is to structure the original problem, not the user's attempt. The example given in the original question had the problem's assumptions and the problem statement, excluding the user's attempts. Therefore, here, we need to do the same: take the original problem from Hatcher, filter out the user's attempt, and structure it accordingly.",
