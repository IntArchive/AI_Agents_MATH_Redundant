    "Content": "Let $f : (0, \\infty) \\to (0, \\infty)$ be a function that has primitives (that is, there is $F$ so that $F' = f$) and satisfies the relation $$f\\left(\\displaystyle{\\frac{f(x)}{x}}\\right)= f(x) , \\forall x \\in (0, \\infty)$$ Prove that $f$ is continuous. I tried to obtain something with repeated substitutions and use the fact that if $f$ has primitives then I can use the intermediate value theorem, but I didn't manage to solve it. Remark this question is found in a Romanian mathematics magazine called \"Gazeta matematica\".",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Using @md2perpe's comment, let $g: (0, \\infty) \\to (0, \\infty), g(x) = \\displaystyle{\\frac{f(x)}{x}}$. The equation from the hypothesis becomes $g(g(x)) = x, \\forall x \\in (0, \\infty)$. Note that $g$ is bijective. But, because $f$ has primitives and $ h : (0,\\infty)→(0,\\infty),h(x)=x$ also has primitives, then we know that $\\displaystyle{\\frac{f}{h}}$ has the intermediate value property$(*)$, so $g$ has the intermediate value property. Now, because $g$ is bijective and has the intermediate value property, $g$ is continuous. Therefore $f(x) = xg(x)$ is continuous. $(*)$I only need to show now that $\\displaystyle{\\frac{f}{h}}$ has the intermediate value property. This is true because of one of Jarnik's propositions. That is: Let $f,g : [a,b] \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be two differentiable functions on $[a,b]$ and $g'(x) \\neq 0, \\forall x \\in [a,b]$. Then $h = \\displaystyle{\\frac{f'}{g'}}$ has the intermediate value property. Proof: Evidently, $g'(a)$ and $g'(b)$ have the same sign. If they don't, then because $g'$ has the intermediate value property, there exists $c \\in [a,b]$ such that $g'(c) = 0$, so we obtain a contradiction. Now let $\\lambda$ be an intermediate value between $\\displaystyle{\\frac{f'(a)}{g'(a)}}$ and $\\displaystyle{\\frac{f'(b)}{g'(b)}}$. Let $F : [a,b] \\to \\mathbb{R}, F(x) = f(x) - \\lambda g(x)$. Evidently $F$ is differentiable, $F'(a) = g'(a) \\left (\\displaystyle{\\frac{f'(a)}{g'(a)} - \\lambda}\\right)$ and $F'(b) = g'(b) \\left (\\displaystyle{\\frac{f'(b)}{g'(b)} - \\lambda}\\right)$, so $F'(a)$ and $F'(b)$ have different signs, therefore there exists $d \\in [a,b]$ such that $F'(d) = 0$, so we are done.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem and structure it according to the required format. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor, so I need to make sure I understand the problem correctly and then format it properly.\n\nFirst, let's read the original question from Math Stack Exchange. The title is: \"Assume $f\\left({\\frac{f(x)}{x}}\\right)= f(x)$. Show that $f$ continuous\". The question body provides more details. The function $f$ is defined from $(0, \\infty)$ to $(0, \\infty)$. It has primitives, meaning there exists an $F$ such that $F' = f$. Also, it satisfies the functional equation $f\\left(\\frac{f(x)}{x}\\right) = f(x)$ for all $x > 0$. The task is to prove that $f$ is continuous.\n\nSo, I need to list the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let me break down the assumptions:\n\n1. The domain of $f$ is $(0, \\infty)$. \n2. The codomain of $f$ is $(0, \\infty)$.\n3. $f$ has primitives, i.e., there exists a function $F$ such that $F' = f$. \n4. For every $x \\in (0, \\infty)$, the equation $f\\left(\\frac{f(x)}{x}\\right) = f(x)$ holds.\n\nEach of these is a separate condition. The first two define the function's domain and codomain. The third is about the existence of an antiderivative, and the fourth is the functional equation. \n\nThe problem statement is to prove that $f$ is continuous. The original problem didn't have any extra assumptions beyond these, so I shouldn't add or remove any. The user example had an assumption that $n$ is divisible by 7, but here there's no such additional condition. The key is to filter out unrelated information. The user mentioned they tried substitutions and using the intermediate value theorem via primitives but didn't succeed. However, that's part of the question's context, not assumptions for the problem. So in the formatted problem, we only include the given conditions and the problem to prove continuity.\n\nI should check if all assumptions are covered. The function is from positive reals to positive reals, has an antiderivative, satisfies that functional equation, and we need to show continuity. Each of these points is separate. So, the assumptions should list each of these points individually.",
