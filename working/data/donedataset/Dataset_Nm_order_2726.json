    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let's take a look at this problem. The user wants to prove that for any integer x greater than 1, x and x+1 are coprime. First, I need to structure the problem according to the specified format. \n\nSo, the original question states that x is greater than 1 and asks to prove that x and x+1 are coprime. The key here is to identify the assumptions. The main assumption is that x is an integer greater than 1. The problem then is to prove coprimality.\n\nWait, the example given in the problem format had two assumptions: one about n being an integer and another about n being divisible by 7. But in this case, the only condition given is x > 1. However, the problem mentions \"any given x\", which implies x is an integer. But should we explicitly state that x is an integer? The original question says \"Given {x | x > 1}\", which in set notation usually assumes x is an integer unless specified otherwise, but sometimes people might consider real numbers. However, coprimality is a concept for integers. So the assumption should be that x is an integer greater than 1. \n\nTherefore, the assumptions are: x is an integer, and x > 1. Each of these should be separate lines in the assumptions. The problem is to prove that x and x+1 are coprime. \n\nLet me check if there's any other implicit assumption. Since coprime means their greatest common divisor is 1, and the problem is about consecutive integers. The standard proof uses the Euclidean algorithm: gcd(x, x+1) = gcd(x, 1) = 1. But the user isn't asking for the proof, just to structure the problem. So the assumptions are correctly captured as x being an integer and x being greater than 1. The problem is to prove coprimality. \n\nI think that's all. There are no other hidden conditions here. The key is making sure that both the integer nature and the x > 1 condition are listed as separate assumptions.",
