    "Content": "Let $G$ be a group and $H$ be a subgroup of $G$ with finite index. I want to show that there exists a normal subgroup $N$ of $G$ with finite index and $N \\subset H$. The hint for this exercise is to find a homomorphism $G \\to S_n$ for $n := [G:H]$ with kernel contained in $H$. The standard solution suggests to choose $\\varphi$ as the homomorphism induced by left-multiplication $\\varphi: G \\to S(G/H) \\cong S_n$. I'm not 100% sure if I understand this correctly. What exactly does $\\varphi$ do? We take $g \\in G$ and send it to a bijection $\\varphi_g: G/H \\to G/H, xH \\mapsto gxH$? If so, how can I see that its kernel is contained in $H$? Also, the standard solution claims its image is isomorphic to $G/N$ and thus $N$ has a finite index in $G$, how can I see that the image is isomorphic to $G/N$? Thanks in advance for any help.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Your definition of $\\varphi$ looks fine. Anything in the kernel must in particular fix $H$, and $gH = H$ is equivalent to $g \\in H$. On the other hand I think $N = \\ker \\varphi$ can be a proper subgroup of $H$. As an example, which is silly because the group is finite, if you take $G = S_3$ and $H = \\{1, (12)\\}$ then this process produces $N = \\{1\\}$. For the second question, this is just the \"first\" isomorphism theorem .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the original question is about proving that if H is a subgroup of finite index in a group G, then there exists a normal subgroup N of G with finite index such that N is contained in H. The hint mentions using a homomorphism from G to the symmetric group S_n, where n is the index of H in G, and the kernel of this homomorphism should be contained in H. The user is confused about how exactly this homomorphism works, why its kernel is in H, and why the image is isomorphic to G/N leading to N having finite index.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some group theory concepts. When we have a subgroup H of G with finite index n, the set of left cosets G/H has size n. The symmetric group on this set, S(G/H), is isomorphic to S_n because there are n elements to permute. The homomorphism φ: G → S(G/H) is defined by the action of G on the left cosets of H. Specifically, each element g in G induces a permutation φ_g of the cosets by left multiplication: φ_g(xH) = gxH. This makes sense because multiplying each coset by g just shuffles them around, which is a bijection.\n\nNow, the kernel of φ would be the set of all elements g in G that act trivially on the cosets. That is, g such that gxH = xH for every x in G. But for this to hold for all x, in particular when x is the identity, we get gH = H, which implies g is in H. So the kernel is contained in H. Wait, but the kernel is the intersection of all conjugates of H, right? Because for the action on cosets, the kernel is the largest normal subgroup contained in H. So actually, the kernel is the core of H in G, which is the intersection of all conjugates gHg^{-1} for g in G. This core is a normal subgroup of G and is contained in H. Since the index of H is finite, the core will also have finite index because it's the kernel of a homomorphism to a finite symmetric group S_n. Hence, the image of φ is a subgroup of S_n, which is finite, so the kernel (core of H) has finite index in G. Therefore, N = ker φ is the desired normal subgroup.\n\nThe user also asked about why the image is isomorphic to G/N. By the First Isomorphism Theorem, the image of φ is isomorphic to G / ker φ, which is G/N. Since the image is a subgroup of S_n, which is finite, G/N must be finite, so N has finite index in G. This should address all parts of the problem. So putting it all together, the key steps are constructing the homomorphism via the action on cosets, showing its kernel is the core of H (hence normal and contained in H), and using the First Isomorphism Theorem to conclude finite index.",
