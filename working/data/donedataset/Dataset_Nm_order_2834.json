Let $h\\in H$ \nby applying f to it\n $f(ghg^{-1})=f(g)f(h)f(g)^{-1}=e $ My question is how is this a proof that the kernel is normal. What is the reason we apply f to it ? By applying f dont we just prove that $f(ghg^{-1})$ is normal ?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The argument goes as: Let $f: G \\to G_1$ be the homomorphism, and let $H = \\operatorname{Ker}(f) = \\{g \\in G \\; | \\; f(g)=e \\}$ be its kernel. A subgroup is normal if it is invariant by conjugation. So fix an arbitrary element $h \\in H$. For all $g \\in G$, is it true that $ghg^{-1} \\in H$ (which would mean that $H$ is indeed invariant by conjugation)? And then he proves it as you have done above:\n$$f(ghg^{-1}) = f(g)f(h)f(g^{-1}) = f(g)f(g)^{-1} = e$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants me to structure the question from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The original question is about proving that the kernel of a homomorphism is a normal subgroup. The user provided an example where assumptions and the problem are separated.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question. The user's professor showed that for a homomorphism f, and elements g and h (with h in the kernel), f(ghg⁻¹) = e, thus concluding the kernel is normal. The student is confused because applying f seems to only show that the conjugate is in the kernel, not why the kernel is normal in general.\n\nNow, to format this into the Assumption and Problem sections. The assumptions should list all the given conditions. The problem is the actual question to be addressed.\n\nAssumptions here would include that f is a group homomorphism, H is the kernel of f, and perhaps that we're working within group theory's context. Each assumption should be one line, one property per object. The problem is to understand why the given proof shows the kernel is normal.\n\nWait, let me check. The original proof takes an element h in the kernel and shows that for any g, the conjugate ghg⁻¹ is also in the kernel. That's the standard proof. The student's confusion is why applying f here suffices. So the key assumptions are that f is a homomorphism, kernel H is a subgroup, and the structure of group elements under conjugation.\n\nBut the user's example in the problem structured had assumptions like \"n is an integer\", \"n is divisible by 7\". So here, the assumptions would be:\n\n- f is a group homomorphism.\n- H is the kernel of f.\n- The group operation is considered in the domain of f.\n- Conjugation by any group element g is considered.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the student mentions \"Let h ∈ H\" (the kernel), and then shows f(ghg⁻¹) = e. So the key points are that f is a homomorphism, H is the kernel, and the conjugation is being used. The problem is to explain why this proves H is normal.\n\nBut according to the format, assumptions should be listed as given conditions. The problem is the question to be answered. So in the formatted version, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a group homomorphism,\nH is the kernel of f,\nFor all g in the group and h in H, the element ghg⁻¹ is considered.\n\nProblem: Explain why showing that f(ghg⁻¹) = e for all g in the group and h in H proves that H is a normal subgroup.\n\nWait, but the original question was phrased as \"how is this a proof that the kernel is normal. What is the reason we apply f to it? By applying f don't we just prove that f(ghg⁻¹) is normal?\"\n\nHmm. The key is that the kernel is normal if for any g, gHg⁻¹ is a subset of H. The professor's proof shows that for any h in H, ghg⁻¹ is also in H (since f(ghg⁻¹) = e), hence H is normal. The student is confused about why applying f here suffices.\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n- f is a group homomorphism.\n- H is the kernel of f (i.e., H = {h | f(h) = e}).\n- The operation considered is group conjugation.\n\nProblem: Why does showing f(ghg⁻¹) = e for all g in the group and h in H prove that H is a normal subgroup?\n\nBut in the original question, the user is asking for the reasoning behind this proof. The formatted problem needs to capture the core question. So, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a group homomorphism,\nH is the kernel of the homomorphism f,\nFor any element g in the group and h in H, the conjugate ghg⁻¹ is considered.\n\nProblem: Explain why demonstrating that f(ghg⁻¹) = e implies that H is a normal subgroup.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is phrased as \"Prove that the kernel H is a normal subgroup by showing that f(ghg⁻¹) = e for all g in the group and h in H.\"\n\nBut the original question is more about understanding why the given steps constitute a proof. So the problem is to justify that showing f(ghg⁻¹) = e for all g and h in H suffices to prove H is normal.\n\nTherefore, after listing the assumptions, the problem is to connect that demonstration to the conclusion of normality.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a group homomorphism,\nH is the kernel of f,\nFor any g in the group and h in H, the element ghg⁻¹ is in the domain of f.\n\nProblem: Why does showing that f(ghg⁻¹) = e for all g in the group and h in H prove that H is a normal subgroup?\n\nBut the original question title is \"Proving the kernel is a normal subgroup.\" The question is about understanding the given proof. So maybe the problem statement should be: \"Prove that the kernel H is a normal subgroup by showing that for any g in the group and h in H, f(ghg⁻¹) = e.\"\n\nAlternatively, to match the user's example, which took the original problem statement and rephrased it with assumptions. The original problem in the example was to prove A(n) divisible by 91, with assumptions on n being integer and divisible by 7. Wait, but in that example, the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7; the formatted problem added that as an assumption. Wait, no. Wait the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. However, 91 is 13*7, so perhaps the answer requires that n is such that 5^n and 6^n have certain properties modulo 7 and 13. But the user example seems to have added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. That might be an error. But perhaps the user example is illustrative, not necessarily accurate.\n\nBut in any case, for the current problem, the key is to extract the assumptions from the original question and structure them. The original question says: \"My professor proved that the kernel is a normal subgroup under a homomorphism f by saying. Let h∈H by applying f to it f(ghg^{-1})=f(g)f(h)f(g)^{-1}=e. My question is how is this a proof that the kernel is normal. What is the reason we apply f to it ? By applying f don't we just prove that f(ghg^{-1}) is normal ?\"\n\nSo the assumptions here are:\n\n- f is a group homomorphism.\n- H is the kernel of f.\n- The professor's proof considers conjugation of h by g (ghg⁻¹) and applies f to it.\n\nThe problem is to explain why this process proves H is normal.\n\nBut according to the format, assumptions should list all the given conditions. The original problem states that H is the kernel, f is a homomorphism, and the professor used conjugation and applying f. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a group homomorphism,\nH is the kernel of f,\nFor any g in the group and h in H, ghg⁻¹ is an element of the group.\n\nProblem: How does showing that f(ghg⁻¹) = e for all g in the group and h in H prove that H is a normal subgroup?\n\nBut maybe more precisely, the problem is to connect the professor's steps to the conclusion. The formatted problem should capture the essence of the question. So perhaps:\n\nProblem: Explain why the argument that f(ghg⁻¹) = e for all g in the group and h in H demonstrates that H is a normal subgroup.\n\nAlternatively, since the original problem is titled \"Proving the kernel is a normal subgroup,\" and the question is about understanding the given proof, the problem statement could be: \"Prove that the kernel H is a normal subgroup by showing that f(ghg⁻¹) = e for all g in the group and h in H.\"\n\nBut the user's confusion is about why applying f to ghg⁻¹ shows H is normal. So the problem is to justify that step.\n\nTherefore, after considering all this, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a group homomorphism,\nH is the kernel of the homomorphism f,\nFor any element g in the group and h in H, the conjugate ghg⁻¹ is considered.\n\nProblem: Why does demonstrating that f(ghg⁻¹) = e for all g in the group and h in H prove that H is a normal subgroup?\n\nBut to match the example's style, where assumptions are properties of objects, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a group homomorphism,\nH is the kernel of f,\nFor every element g in the group and h in H, ghg⁻¹ is in the domain of f.\n\nProblem: Prove that H is a normal subgroup by showing f(ghg⁻¹) = e.\n\nBut the original problem's core question is \"how is this a proof that the kernel is normal. What is the reason we apply f to it?\" So maybe the problem is phrased as: \"Explain why applying the homomorphism f to ghg⁻¹ demonstrates that the kernel H is a normal subgroup.\"\n\nBut in the example, the problem was restructured as \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91.\" So following that, here the problem should be \"Prove that the kernel H is a normal subgroup by showing f(ghg⁻¹) = e.\"\n\nBut the original question is asking for an explanation of why this approach works. So perhaps the problem is to \"Prove that the kernel H is a normal subgroup by demonstrating that f(ghg⁻¹) = e for all g in the group and h in H.\"\n\nAlternatively, to capture the user's confusion, maybe the problem is: \"Why does showing f(ghg⁻¹) = e for all g in the group and h in H prove that H is a normal subgroup?\"\n\nBut the format requires the problem to be a statement to be proven or explained. The original question is a request for explanation, so structuring it as a \"Prove that...\" may not fit. However, in the example, the problem was restated as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91,\" even though the original problem said \"Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\" The example added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which might be part of the solution, but not part of the original problem. This suggests that maybe the example's formatting is not perfect, but we should follow it as per the user's instruction.\n\nGiven that, perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- f is a group homomorphism.\n- H is the kernel of f.\n- The group is closed under conjugation (which is generally true in groups).\n\nAnd the problem is: \"Prove that H is a normal subgroup by showing that f(ghg⁻¹) = e for all g in the group and h in H.\"\n\nBut the original question is about understanding why the professor's steps constitute a proof. So the problem statement is about connecting the given steps to the conclusion.\n\nAlternatively, considering the example, maybe the user wants to extract the key assumptions from the problem context. In the original question, the key given elements are:\n\n- f is a homomorphism.\n- H is the kernel of f.\n- The professor used the fact that f(ghg⁻¹) = e.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would list these assumptions and pose the problem as per the user's question.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the correct formatting should be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a group homomorphism,\nH is the kernel of the homomorphism f,\nFor any element g in the group and h in H, the conjugate ghg⁻¹ is an element of the group.\n\nProblem: Explain why demonstrating that f(ghg⁻¹) = e for all g in the group and h in H proves that H is a normal subgroup.\n\nBut according to the example, the problem is phrased as a statement to prove, not a question. However, the original problem in the example was a statement (\"Prove that...\"), while here the user's question is asking for an explanation. However, the user's instruction says to structure the problem in the given format, which in the example was \"Prove that...\". So maybe the problem should be phrased as a directive to prove, even if the original question is a request for explanation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to be kept as the original question's core, which is \"Prove that the kernel is a normal subgroup,\" with assumptions being the homomorphism and kernel.\n\nBut let's check the example again. The original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was not in the original problem. This suggests that the assistant in the example might have made a mistake, or perhaps it's intentional to highlight a specific case. However, the user's instruction says to filter unrelated information and structure the problem with assumptions. So perhaps in the current case, the assumptions are:\n\n- f is a group homomorphism.\n- H is the kernel of f.\n\nAnd the problem is: \"Prove that H is a normal subgroup by showing that f(ghg⁻¹) = e for all g in the group and h in H.\"\n\nBut the step where f is applied is part of the proof technique, not an assumption. So the assumptions are the existence of the homomorphism and the kernel. The problem is to prove normality using conjugation and the homomorphism.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions should include the properties used in the proof, like conjugation. But conjugation is a standard group operation, inherent to the group structure, so perhaps it's not an assumption but a given.\n\nIn conclusion, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a group homomorphism,\nH is the kernel of f.\n\nProblem: Prove that H is a normal subgroup by showing that for any element g in the group and h in H, f(ghg⁻¹) = e.\n\nThis captures the core of the original question, which is about connecting the application of f to conjugation in the kernel to prove normality.",
