    "Content": "I am having a little trouble understanding proofs without truth tables particularly when it comes to → Here is a problem I am confused with: Show that (p ∧ q) → (p ∨ q) is a tautology The first step shows: (p ∧ q) → (p ∨ q) ≡ ¬(p ∧ q) ∨ (p ∨ q) I've been reading my text book and looking at Equivalence Laws. I know the answer to this but I don't understand the first step. How is (p ∧ q)→ ≡ ¬(p ∧ q)? If someone could explain this I would be extremely grateful. I'm sure its something simple and I am overlooking it. The first thing I want to do when seeing this is (p ∧ q) → (p ∨ q) ≡ ¬(p → ¬q)→(p ∨ q) but the answer shows: ¬ (p ∧ q) ∨ (p ∨ q)     (by logical equivalence) I don't see a equivalence law that explains this.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "It is because of the following equivalence law, which you can prove from a truth table:\n$$r\\rightarrow s\\equiv \\lnot r\\lor s.$$\nIf you let $r = p\\land q$ and $s = p\\lor q$, you get what you are looking for, namely that\n$$(p\\land q)\\rightarrow (p\\lor q)\\equiv \\lnot(p\\land q)\\lor(p\\lor q).$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to show that the proposition (p ∧ q) → (p ∨ q) is a tautology. They mentioned being confused about the first step in the solution, which transforms the implication into ¬(p ∧ q) ∨ (p ∨ q). \n\nFirst, I need to recall the basic logical equivalences. The key one here is the Material Implication law, which states that any implication A → B is logically equivalent to ¬A ∨ B. So applying this to (p ∧ q) → (p ∨ q), we replace A with (p ∧ q) and B with (p ∨ q). That directly gives ¬(p ∧ q) ∨ (p ∨ q). The user was unsure how this step works, so explaining the Material Implication equivalence should clarify it.\n\nNext, maybe they are confused because they expected another form or didn't recognize the equivalence law used. The user mentioned trying to convert the implication into ¬(p → ¬q) → (p ∨ q), which might be a misapplication of some other rule. It's important to point out that Material Implication is the direct conversion here, not involving nested implications.\n\nThen, once the expression is in the form ¬(p ∧ q) ∨ (p ∨ q), the next steps would involve simplifying using De Morgan's laws or other logical equivalences. For example, ¬(p ∧ q) is equivalent to ¬p ∨ ¬q by De Morgan's. Then, combining ¬p ∨ ¬q with p ∨ q, we can see that each literal (p, q, their negations) covers all possibilities, leading to a tautology.\n\nBut since the problem is just about the first step, the main focus is confirming that the transformation using Material Implication is correct. The assumptions here would involve recognizing that we're working within propositional logic, using standard equivalence laws, and applying them to the given propositions p and q. There's no specific condition on p and q other than being propositions, so the assumptions are straightforward.\n\nI need to structure the problem according to the given format. The original question is to show that (p ∧ q) → (p ∨ q) is a tautology. The user's confusion is about the first equivalence step. In the formatted problem, the assumptions would list any conditions on p and q, but since this is propositional logic, typically the only assumption is that p and q are propositions. However, sometimes in such problems, there might be an implicit assumption that logical equivalences can be applied. But in this case, the key assumption is that we're using the Material Implication equivalence law. However, the example given in the original instruction didn't list laws as assumptions, just conditions on variables. \n\nLooking back at the example provided, the original problem was about divisibility by 91, and the assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So in that case, the assumptions were about the variable's properties. Translating to this logic problem, the variables p and q are propositions. So the assumptions would be that p and q are propositions. Since in propositional logic, propositions can be any statements with truth values, but there's no specific restriction here. Therefore, the only assumption is that p and q are propositions. The problem is to show that the implication is a tautology, which means it's always true regardless of the truth values of p and q.\n\nWait, but in the example, the user had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but the original problem stated \"for every integer n\". However, the formatted problem included the assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems contradictory. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption was n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so why is the assumption that n is divisible by 7? Maybe there was a mistake in the example. Wait, perhaps the example was incorrect. Because if the problem is to prove for every integer n, then the assumption shouldn't restrict n to being divisible by 7. That would actually change the problem. Hmm. That's confusing. Maybe the user made a mistake in their example. But regardless, I need to follow the instruction to structure the problem as per the format.\n\nIn the current problem about the tautology, the original question doesn't state any restrictions on p and q, so the only assumption is that p and q are propositions. But maybe in the context of the problem, since it's propositional logic, that's implicit. However, the example included assumptions even when the original problem stated \"for every integer n\". So perhaps in the example, they listed the conditions given in the problem. Wait, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which is a universal quantification. The formatted problem's assumption lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But that's contradictory because the original problem was for every integer, but the formatted problem adds an extra condition. That suggests maybe the example is incorrect. But regardless, I have to follow the user's example.\n\nWait, perhaps the original problem had a mistake, or maybe the user intended to include additional constraints. Alternatively, maybe the example is from a different problem. Anyway, moving forward.\n\nFor the current problem: Show that (p ∧ q) → (p ∨ q) is a tautology.\n\nAssumptions: The problem is in propositional logic, so p and q are propositions. There are no other constraints given. The task is to prove the statement is always true, regardless of p and q's truth values. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- p is a proposition.\n- q is a proposition.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. So translating that here, each assumption is about one object (here, p and q) and their properties. So each line is an assumption about one object. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\np is a proposition,\nq is a proposition.\n\nProblem: Show that (p ∧ q) → (p ∨ q) is a tautology.\n\nThat seems correct. Even though in propositional logic, p and q are typically assumed to be propositions, but to align with the example, which listed the variable's properties, here we list p and q as propositions.\n\nThe user's confusion is about the equivalence step, but in terms of structuring the problem, the assumptions are just about p and q being propositions. The problem is to show the tautology. The rest of the user's question is their confusion about the steps, which is part of the original question but not part of the formatted problem structure.",
