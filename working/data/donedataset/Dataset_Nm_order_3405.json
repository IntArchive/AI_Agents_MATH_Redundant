    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to format this problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified structure. Let me start by reading the original question carefully.\n\nThe title is \"A gamma function inequality,\" and the question states: \"I would like to prove $$\\frac{\\Gamma(n+\\frac{1}{2})}{\\Gamma(n+1)} \\le \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}$$ for all natural $n \\ge 1$. The inequality does seem to be true numerically, but the proof eludes me.\"\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The user mentions \"all natural $n \\ge 1$,\" so that's one assumption. The problem is about proving the given inequality involving the Gamma function. \n\nLooking at the example provided, each assumption is listed line by line, addressing only one property or condition applied to one object. In the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the natural number n being greater than or equal to 1 is the key condition. Since there's only one condition here, that's the only assumption. \n\nWait, is there any other implicit assumption? The Gamma function is defined for all complex numbers except non-positive integers, but since n is a natural number starting at 1, Gamma(n+1) is just n!, which is fine. Gamma(n + 1/2) is also defined for these n. So the only explicit assumption given by the user is that n is a natural number and n ≥ 1. \n\nSo the assumptions should be listed as \"n is a natural number,\" and \"n ≥ 1.\" But wait, in the example, the user had two separate assumptions: \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" Here, \"natural number\" already implies integer ≥1, but the user specifies \"n ≥ 1.\" However, in mathematics, natural numbers usually start at 1, so maybe \"n is a natural number\" suffices. But the user wrote \"for all natural n ≥ 1,\" which might be redundant, but to be precise, perhaps list both? Wait, the example's first assumption was \"n is an integer,\" which is broader, then a specific condition. Here, natural numbers are integers ≥1, so maybe \"n is a natural number\" is enough. But the problem states \"for all natural n ≥ 1,\" which might be emphasizing that n starts at 1. However, since natural numbers typically start at 1, maybe it's redundant. But to be safe, perhaps split into two assumptions: \"n is a natural number\" and \"n ≥ 1.\" Wait, but in the example, the user had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" Here, \"n is a natural number\" is one assumption, and \"n ≥ 1\" is another? But natural numbers are by definition ≥1, so maybe that's redundant. Wait, perhaps in some contexts, natural numbers start at 0, but here the user specifies n ≥1. So to be precise, maybe two assumptions: \"n is a natural number\" and \"n ≥ 1.\" But in the example, it was split into two separate lines. Alternatively, maybe \"n is a natural number with n ≥ 1\" as one line. But according to the example, each assumption should address only one property. So perhaps \"n is a natural number\" and \"n ≥ 1.\" Although technically, being a natural number already implies n ≥1 if we take the definition starting at 1. But in some contexts, natural numbers start at 0, so maybe the user wants to clarify that n starts at 1. Therefore, to follow the example's structure, list each condition separately. So:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a natural number,\nn ≥ 1.\n\nBut wait, \"n is a natural number\" could include n=1,2,..., so the second condition might be redundant. However, the original problem states \"for all natural n ≥1,\" which might be emphasizing the starting point. To adhere strictly to the user's instruction, each assumption should address only one property. So \"n is a natural number\" and \"n ≥ 1\" could be considered two separate assumptions. However, if the definition of natural numbers here starts at 1, then \"n is a natural number\" suffices. But given the problem statement includes \"n ≥1,\" perhaps the user wants to make it explicit. Therefore, to capture the problem exactly as stated, we have two assumptions: natural number and n ≥1. But maybe in this case, since natural numbers are already ≥1, it's redundant. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the user is using \"natural number\" in a context where 0 is included, so they need to specify n ≥1. Therefore, to be safe, list both.\n\nWait, looking back at the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n,\" and the formatted assumptions listed \"n is an integer,\" \"n is divisible by 7.\" But the original problem didn't say \"n is an integer divisible by 7,\" but the formatted problem split into two assumptions. So following that pattern, if the problem says \"for all natural n ≥1,\" the assumptions should be split into \"n is a natural number\" and \"n ≥1.\" Even if the first implies the second, following the example's approach. Because in the example, the problem said \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7,\" which is a separate condition. So perhaps here, even though natural numbers are ≥1, the user specified \"n ≥1,\" so we should list both. Alternatively, maybe the problem's \"for all natural n ≥1\" is just emphasizing the domain, so \"n is a natural number\" and \"n ≥1\" are two separate assumptions. But maybe in the problem's context, \"natural number\" includes 1 and up, so \"n is a natural number\" suffices. But the example shows that even if a condition is implied by another, it's listed separately. For example, in the example, n being an integer divisible by 7 is split into two assumptions. So perhaps here, \"n is a natural number\" and \"n ≥1\" would be two assumptions. But since natural numbers usually start at 1, maybe \"n is a natural number\" is sufficient. However, to match the user's explicit statement in the problem, which includes \"n ≥1,\" perhaps we should list both. I think the user wants to capture every explicit condition mentioned in the problem. The problem says \"for all natural n ≥1,\" so the assumptions are that n is natural and n ≥1. Therefore, two separate assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a natural number,\nn ≥ 1.\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\frac{\\Gamma(n+\\frac{1}{2})}{\\Gamma(n+1)} \\le \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}$$ for all natural $n \\ge 1$.\n\nWait, but the original problem already states \"for all natural n ≥1,\" which is covered by the assumptions. So the problem statement in the formatted version can just say \"Prove that [inequality].\" without repeating \"for all natural n ≥1\" because the assumptions already cover that. But in the example, the problem statement still included \"for every integer n\" even though the assumptions had \"n is an integer.\" Hmm, looking back at the example:\n\nOriginal problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n)... is divisible by 91.\"\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Then problem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but in the formatted problem, the problem statement doesn't include \"for every integer n\" anymore because the assumptions are listed separately. But in the example, the original problem's conclusion was that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem's assumptions include that n is an integer divisible by 7, and the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. So they modified the problem's scope based on the assumptions. Wait, but in the user's example, perhaps the original problem had a mistake, or maybe the formatted problem is correcting it. Wait, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem's assumptions include that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. Wait, maybe there was a mistake in the example. Alternatively, perhaps the example is showing that sometimes assumptions need to be extracted even if not explicitly stated. Wait, but the user's instruction says \"filtered the unrelated informations,\" so perhaps in that example, the user had to include additional assumptions. But this seems confusing. Let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal problem: \"Prove that for every integer $n$, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\"\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems contradictory. If the original problem says \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. That suggests that maybe the example is incorrect, or perhaps there was a misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a typo, and the correct assumption was that n is divisible by 7. But regardless, the example shows that assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property. So applying that to the current problem.\n\nThe current problem states \"for all natural n ≥1,\" so the assumptions are n is a natural number and n ≥1. Then the problem is to prove the inequality. Therefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a natural number,\nn ≥ 1.\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\frac{\\Gamma(n+\\frac{1}{2})}{\\Gamma(n+1)} \\le \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}.$$\n\nBut the original problem includes \"for all natural n ≥1,\" which is now captured in the assumptions, so the problem statement can omit that part. However, in the example, the problem statement still included the \"for every integer n\" part, but the formatted problem omitted it. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem's assumptions included n being divisible by 7, so the problem statement became just \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91,\" without the \"for every integer n\" because the assumptions now restrict n to integers divisible by 7. Therefore, the problem statement in the formatted version is just the core claim without the quantifiers, as the quantifiers are in the assumptions.\n\nTherefore, in this case, since the assumptions are n is a natural number and n ≥1, the problem statement should just be \"Prove that [inequality]\" without the \"for all natural n ≥1\" part. But wait, the original problem's inequality is stated with \"for all natural n ≥1,\" but in the formatted version, since the assumptions already specify the domain of n, the problem can just state the inequality to prove.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a natural number,\nn ≥ 1.\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\frac{\\Gamma(n+\\frac{1}{2})}{\\Gamma(n+1)} \\le \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}.$$\n\nBut wait, in the original problem, the user wrote the Gamma function ratio. Let me check the LaTeX syntax. The user wrote:\n\n$$\\frac{\\Gamma(n+\\frac{1}{2})}{\\Gamma(n+1)} \\le \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}$$\n\nWait, there's a typo here. The closing parentheses for the Gamma functions. Let me check:\n\nOriginal question: \"Prove $$\\frac{\\Gamma(n+\\frac{1}{2})}{\\Gamma(n+1)} \\le \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}$$ for all natural $n \\ge 1$.\"\n\nLooking at the LaTeX, the denominator is \\Gamma(n+1), but it should be \\Gamma(n+1). Wait, no, the user's LaTeX has a typo. Let me parse it:\n\nThe user wrote:\n\n\\frac{\\Gamma(n+\\frac{1}{2})}{\\Gamma(n+1)}\n\nBut in LaTeX, the denominator should be \\Gamma(n+1), so the closing parenthesis is missing. Wait, let's check:\n\nOriginal expression in the question:\n\n$$\\frac{\\Gamma(n+\\frac{1}{2})}{\\Gamma(n+1)} \\le \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}$$\n\nWait, the denominator is written as \\Gamma(n+1), which is missing a closing parenthesis. It should be \\Gamma(n+1). So the correct LaTeX should be \\frac{\\Gamma(n+\\frac{1}{2})}{\\Gamma(n+1)}. But the user's code has a typo where the denominator is written as \\Gamma(n+1) with an extra closing brace. Let me verify:\n\nThe user's code is:\n\n\\frac{\\Gamma(n+\\frac{1}{2})}{\\Gamma(n+1)} \\le \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\n\nWait, no, in the original problem as presented in the user's message, the LaTeX is written as:\n\n$$\\frac{\\Gamma(n+\\frac{1}{2})}{\\Gamma(n+1)} \\le \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}$$\n\nWait, no, looking again, the user's original code in the question is:\n\n$$\\frac{\\Gamma(n+\\frac{1}{2})}{\\Gamma(n+1)} \\le \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}$$\n\nAh, okay, that's correct. The denominator is \\Gamma(n+1), which is correct. The closing parenthesis is there. So no typo. So the LaTeX is fine. So when structuring, we need to preserve that.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem will have the assumption lines and the problem line as above.",
