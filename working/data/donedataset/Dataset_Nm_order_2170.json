    "Content": "Call a function $f : \\mathcal{N} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{N}$ repetitive if for every finite sequence of natural numbers $(a_1, a_2, \\cdots,a_n)$ there exists a number $k \\in \\mathcal{N}$ satisfying $f(k) = a_1$, $f(k+1) = a_2$, ... , $f(k +  n -1) = a_n$. Show that if $f$ is repetitive, then for any combination of $a_i$'s there are actually infinitely many numbers $k$ with this property. I've been trying to figure out a proof for this for a while now. I'm feeling that the fact that the number $k$ exists for every sequence allows us to manipulate other sequences or something like that and get infinitely many numbers that way. But I haven't been able to actually find a way to construct infinitely many numbers $k$ for a random sequence.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me read through the original question carefully.\n\nThe question is about repetitive functions. The user defines a function f from natural numbers to natural numbers as repetitive if for every finite sequence of natural numbers (a1, a2, ..., an), there exists a natural number k such that f(k) = a1, f(k+1) = a2, ..., f(k + n -1) = an). The problem is to show that if f is repetitive, then for any such sequence, there are infinitely many k with this property.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. The original problem states that f is repetitive, which is a key assumption. The definition of repetitive already includes that for every finite sequence, there exists at least one k. But the problem is to show that there are infinitely many such k. So the main assumption here is that f is repetitive. Also, the problem is about functions from N to N, so the domain and codomain are natural numbers.\n\nWait, the example given in the user's instruction had an assumption where n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So each assumption is a separate line. Here, the main assumption is that f is repetitive. But perhaps we need to break down the definition of repetitive into assumptions? Wait, no. The problem's assumption is that f is repetitive, which is defined in the problem. So in the formatted problem, the assumption should be that f is a repetitive function as defined. But according to the example, the user included the specific conditions from the problem. For example, in the example, the assumption was n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So perhaps here, the assumptions would be that f is a function from N to N, and that f is repetitive. Wait, but the problem statement already defines f as a function from N to N. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- f is a function from N to N,\n- f is repetitive (i.e., for every finite sequence of natural numbers, there exists k in N such that f(k) = a1, ..., f(k + n -1) = an).\n\nBut the problem is to show that for any such sequence, there are infinitely many k. So the problem statement is: Show that if f is repetitive, then for any finite sequence of natural numbers, there exist infinitely many k in N satisfying the sequence.\n\nWait, the user's example had the problem restated. So the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem, not the definition. Wait, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they included \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". So perhaps in the problem, the user is supposed to extract the specific conditions, not the entire definition. Wait, in the original example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted problem had an additional assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, perhaps that example is not correct? Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect? Or perhaps the user intended to create a problem where the assumption was n being divisible by 7? Maybe there was a mistake in the example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example was part of a problem where the user needed to filter out some assumptions. Wait, perhaps the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for all integers n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which may not be correct. That seems like a mistake, but perhaps it's a hypothetical example. So, regardless, following the instruction, the task is to extract the assumptions from the problem as given, breaking them into separate lines for each condition.\n\nIn the current problem, the key assumptions are:\n\n1. f is a function from N to N.\n2. f is repetitive, meaning for every finite sequence of natural numbers (a1, a2, ..., an), there exists at least one k in N such that f(k) = a1, f(k+1) = a2, ..., f(k + n -1) = an.\n\nBut the problem is to show that under the condition that f is repetitive, any sequence has infinitely many k's. So the main assumption is that f is repetitive, as defined. But how to structure this? Let's look at the example again. In the example, the problem was restated with the assumptions. The original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they listed \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, perhaps the example was a modified version where the user added an assumption, but that may not be correct. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a hidden assumption. Hmm, maybe the example was incorrect, but the instruction is to follow the format.\n\nIn any case, for the current problem:\n\nThe user defines a function f: N → N as repetitive, with the given property. The problem is to show that if f is repetitive, then for any sequence, there are infinitely many k. So the key assumption is that f is repetitive. But according to the example, each assumption is a single line, addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nTherefore, in the formatted problem, the assumption should be:\n\n- f: N → N is a repetitive function,\n- For every finite sequence (a1, a2, ..., an) of natural numbers, there exists k ∈ N such that f(k) = a1, f(k+1) = a2, ..., f(k + n -1) = an.\n\nWait, but the definition of repetitive is given in the problem. So perhaps the first assumption is that f is a function from N to N, and the second assumption is that f is repetitive. But in the example, the assumptions were split into two: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. So in this case, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a function from N to N,\nf is repetitive (i.e., for every finite sequence of natural numbers, there exists k ∈ N such that f(k), ..., f(k + n -1) match the sequence).\n\nProblem:\nShow that for any finite sequence of natural numbers (a1, a2, ..., an), there are infinitely many k ∈ N such that f(k) = a1, f(k+1) = a2, ..., f(k + n -1) = an.\n\nBut I need to check the original problem's wording. The original problem says: \"Show that if f is repetitive, then for any combination of ai's there are actually infinitely many numbers k with this property.\"\n\nSo the problem is to show that the existence of at least one k (from the definition of repetitive) implies infinitely many k's. Therefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n1. f: N → N is a function.\n2. f is repetitive (i.e., for every finite sequence of natural numbers, there exists at least one k as described).\n\nProblem: Show that for any finite sequence of natural numbers, there are infinitely many k satisfying the sequence.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a function from N to N,\nf is repetitive (for every finite sequence of natural numbers, there exists k ∈ N such that f(k), ..., f(k + n -1) match the sequence).\n\nProblem:\nShow that for any finite sequence of natural numbers (a1, a2, ..., an), there exist infinitely many k ∈ N such that f(k) = a1, f(k+1) = a2, ..., f(k + n -1) = an.\n\nAlternatively, maybe split the definition of repetitive into separate assumptions? But according to the example, each assumption is a single line. So the first line is the function's domain and codomain, the second line is the property of being repetitive. The problem is to show the infinitude of k's.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be structured as:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$f$ is a function from $\\mathcal{N}$ to $\\mathcal{N}$,\n$f$ is repetitive (for every finite sequence of natural numbers, there exists $k \\in \\mathcal{N}$ such that $f(k) = a_1$, $f(k+1) = a_2$, ..., $f(k + n -1) = a_n$).\nProblem:\nShow that for any finite sequence of natural numbers $(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n)$, there exist infinitely many $k \\in \\mathcal{N}$ satisfying $f(k) = a_1$, $f(k+1) = a_2$, ..., $f(k + n -1) = a_n$.",
