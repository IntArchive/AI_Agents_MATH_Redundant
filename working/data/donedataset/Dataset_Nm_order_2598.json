    "Content": "Is it true that a finite degree field extension $L/k$ is separable if and only if $L\\otimes_{k}L$ is a reduced $L$-algebra? Surely the \"only if\" part is true because if the extension is separable, we have the Primitive Element Theorem and everything follows. But I'm asking if it's true, and how to prove the \"if\" part. Thanks.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $x\\in L$ and $f\\in k[X]$ the minimal polynomial of $x$ over $k$. Then $k(x)\\subset L$ and therefore $L\\otimes_kL$ contains $k(x)\\otimes_kL$. Since $k(x)\\simeq k[X]/(f)$ we get $k(x)\\otimes_kL\\simeq L[X]/(f)$. If $x$ is not separable over $k$, then the polynomial $f$ has multiple roots in $L$, so the ring $L[X]/(f)$ is not reduced, a contradiction. Edit. Since $x$ is not separable over $k$ we have $f'(X)=0$. If $f(X)=(X-x)g(X)$ in $L[X]$, then $f'(X)=g(X)+(X-x)g'(X)$, so $X-x\\mid g(X)$. This means that $x$ is a multiple root of $f$ (in $L$), so $f(X)=(X-x)^th(X)$ with $t\\ge 2$ and $h\\in L[X]$ with $h(x)\\ne 0$. (Eventually $h=1$.) Then $\\gcd((X-x)^t,h(X))=1$ in $L[X]$, so by Chinese Remainder Theorem $L[X]/(f)\\simeq L[X]/(X-x)^t\\times L[X]/(h)$, and therefore the ring $L[X]/(f)$ is not reduced.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user is asking whether a finite degree field extension L over k is separable if and only if the tensor product L⊗ₖL is a reduced L-algebra. They mention that the \"only if\" part is true due to the Primitive Element Theorem, but they're unsure about the \"if\" part.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some concepts. A separable extension is one where every element is separable, meaning its minimal polynomial has no repeated roots. The tensor product of fields L⊗ₖL being reduced means it has no nilpotent elements. \n\nThe \"only if\" direction: If L/k is separable and finite, then by Primitive Element Theorem, L = k(α) for some α. Then L⊗ₖL would be isomorphic to L[x]/(f(x)), where f is the minimal polynomial of α. Since α is separable, f splits into distinct linear factors in some extension, so L⊗ₖL is a product of fields, hence reduced. That makes sense.\n\nNow the \"if\" part: Suppose L⊗ₖL is reduced. Need to show L/k is separable. Assume for contradiction that L/k is not separable. Then in characteristic p>0, there exists an element β in L that's not separable over k. The minimal polynomial of β would be of the form g(x^p^e) for some e≥1, which has repeated roots. \n\nWhen we form L⊗ₖL, consider the element β⊗1 - 1⊗β. If β is inseparable, then β^p is in k, so (β⊗1 - 1⊗β)^p = β^p⊗1 - 1⊗β^p = 0 because β^p is in k and thus central. Therefore, β⊗1 -1⊗β is a non-zero nilpotent element in L⊗ₖL, contradicting the assumption that the tensor product is reduced. Hence, L/k must be separable.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that β⊗1 -1⊗β is non-zero. Since β is not in k (because the extension is nontrivial and inseparable), then β⊗1 and 1⊗β are distinct in L⊗ₖL, so their difference is non-zero. Therefore, this gives a nilpotent element, which can't exist in a reduced algebra. Therefore, the \"if\" direction holds.\n\nSo the equivalence is true. Therefore, the answer is yes, the statement is true. The key is using the existence of a non-separable element leading to a nilpotent in the tensor product.",
