    "AcceptedAnswer": "The cardioid is the boundary of the set of $c$s for which the iteration of\n$$ z\\mapsto z^2+c $$ has an attractive fixpoint. Given $c$ we can find the fixpoints easily by solving a quadratic equation, and we get\n$$ z_* = \\frac{1\\pm\\sqrt{1-4c}}2 $$\nFrom the general theory of iterated systems, we know that the fixpoint is attractive if $\\left|\\frac d{dz}(z^2+c) \\right| < 1$ at $z_*$, which works out to $|z_*|<\\frac12$. Thus we ought to find the boundary of the area in question by equating $z_*$ to $\\frac12 e^{it}$. From\n$$ \\frac12 e^{it} = \\frac{1\\pm\\sqrt{1-4c}}{2} $$\na bit of simple algebra will give you\n$$ c = e^{it}\\frac{\\pm2-e^{it}}4 $$\nas claimed. (And the solution with $\\pm2=-2$ just corresponds to taking $e^{i(t+\\pi)}$ instead). Knowing that the boundary of \"the area where the iteration has an attractive fixpoint\" is included in the boundary of the entire Mandelbrot set is more involved, and I don't know how to prove that.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then the problem is restated clearly.\n\nThe original question is about proving that the boundary of the Mandelbrot set contains a cardioid given by the equation c = e^{it} (2 - e^{it})/4. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions here. The problem mentions the Mandelbrot set's boundary containing a cardioid. The cardioid is specifically given by that parametric equation. So, the main objects here are the Mandelbrot set's boundary and the cardioid. \n\nAssumptions would likely include the definition of the Mandelbrot set, the parametrization of the cardioid, and perhaps that t is a real parameter (since it's a parametric equation). Wait, but in the example, the assumptions were about the variables involved. For instance, in the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. \n\nIn the current problem, the cardioid is given as c = e^{it}(2 - e^{it})/4. So maybe the assumptions here would be that c is a complex parameter in the Mandelbrot set's boundary, and that the cardioid is parameterized by t, which is a real number. But the problem is to prove that this specific cardioid is part of the boundary. \n\nWait, the problem isn't stating any assumptions given by the user, but rather the question is how to prove that the boundary contains this cardioid. So perhaps the assumptions are inherent in the problem's setup. Let me think again.\n\nThe Mandelbrot set is defined as the set of complex numbers c for which the function f_c(z) = z² + c does not diverge when iterated from z=0. The main cardioid of the Mandelbrot set is the region where the fixed point of f_c is attracting. The boundary of the Mandelbrot set includes this cardioid. But the question specifically mentions that the boundary contains the cardioid given by that equation. So perhaps the key assumption is that this parametrization describes the boundary component.\n\nBut the original problem doesn't state any assumptions beyond what's in the question. The user just wants to structure the problem as per the example. The example took the original problem, filtered out unrelated info, and listed assumptions. In the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer, but in the formatted problem, they listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. Wait, but in the original example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem included an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Wait, the original problem in the example says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. Maybe the example had a typo. But regardless, the user provided that example, so I need to follow it.\n\nIn the current problem, the Mandelbrot set is given, and the question is about its boundary containing a specific cardioid. The cardioid is parameterized by t. So the assumptions would be:\n\n1. The Mandelbrot set is defined as the set of complex numbers c for which the iteration of f_c(z) = z² + c starting at z=0 does not diverge.\n2. The boundary of the Mandelbrot set contains the points where the behavior of the iteration changes from stable to unstable.\n3. The cardioid in question is parameterized by c = e^{it} (2 - e^{it})/4 where t is a real number.\n\nBut wait, the original problem doesn't state these assumptions; it's part of the problem's context. The user's example extracted assumptions from the problem statement. Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which becomes an assumption that \"n is an integer\". Then, perhaps another assumption was added, but in the example, the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7, but the formatted problem included that. That seems like an error. Maybe the example was incorrect, but the user provided it as a reference.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original problem had a mistake. Let me check again. The example's original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem's assumptions are \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But that would mean the problem is to prove divisibility by 91 under the assumption that n is divisible by 7, which might not be the original intention. Maybe the example had a mistake. But regardless, the user wants me to follow the format.\n\nBack to the current problem. The question is why the boundary of the Mandelbrot set contains this cardioid. The problem is to prove that the given cardioid is part of the boundary. The assumptions would include the definition of the Mandelbrot set and the parametrization of the cardioid.\n\nBut in the example, assumptions were specific conditions on the variables. Here, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n1. The Mandelbrot set is defined as the set of complex numbers c where the iteration z_{n+1} = z_n² + c remains bounded starting from z_0 = 0.\n2. The boundary of the Mandelbrot set includes points where small changes in c lead to changes in the boundedness of the iteration.\n3. The cardioid is given by the parametrization c = e^{it}(2 - e^{it})/4 for real t.\n\nBut maybe the key assumptions are just that c is parameterized as that cardioid and that the Mandelbrot set's boundary includes such points. Alternatively, perhaps the problem doesn't have explicit assumptions beyond the given parametrization. However, in the example, the user listed the assumptions that were part of the problem's original statement. The original problem here doesn't state any assumptions; it just asks to prove that the boundary contains the cardioid. So perhaps the assumptions are implicit in the definitions.\n\nWait, maybe in this case, the only assumption is that the cardioid is parameterized by that equation, and the problem is to show it's part of the boundary. But according to the example, each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- The Mandelbrot set's boundary is the set of complex numbers c where the iteration z_{n+1} = z_n² + c is not stable.\n- The cardioid is parameterized by c = e^{it}(2 - e^{it})/4 where t is a real number.\n\nBut perhaps more accurately, the key objects are c in the Mandelbrot set's boundary and the parametrization of the cardioid. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n- c is a complex number on the boundary of the Mandelbrot set.\n- The cardioid is defined by the equation c = e^{it}(2 - e^{it})/4 for real numbers t.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that the boundary contains this cardioid. So perhaps the problem is structured as:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The Mandelbrot set is defined as the set of complex numbers c for which the function f_c(z) = z² + c does not diverge when iterated from z = 0.\n- The boundary of a set consists of points where every neighborhood contains both points in the set and not in the set.\n- The cardioid in question is parameterized by c = e^{it}(2 - e^{it})/4 with t ∈ ℝ.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the boundary of the Mandelbrot set contains the cardioid c = e^{it}(2 - e^{it})/4.\n\nBut I need to follow the example's structure. In the example, assumptions were about the variables in the problem. Here, the variable is c, which is a complex number in the Mandelbrot set's boundary, and the cardioid is parameterized by t. So the assumptions might be:\n\n- c is a complex number.\n- The Mandelbrot set's boundary contains points where the iteration behavior changes.\n- The cardioid is given by c = e^{it}(2 - e^{it})/4 for real t.\n\nBut perhaps it's more precise to list each assumption line by line. Let me check the example again:\n\nOriginal problem in the example: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions:\n- n is an integer,\n- n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so why is \"n is divisible by 7\" an assumption? That seems incorrect. Maybe the example had an error, but the user wants me to follow it regardless. Alternatively, perhaps the example was from a different problem where n needed to be divisible by 7. But regardless, the user's example shows that each assumption is a separate line, each addressing one property of one object.\n\nIn the current problem, the cardioid's parametrization is given. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- c is a complex number on the boundary of the Mandelbrot set.\n- The cardioid is parameterized by c = e^{it}(2 - e^{it})/4 where t is a real number.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that the boundary contains this cardioid. So the assumptions are about the Mandelbrot set's definition and the cardioid's parametrization.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to prove inclusion, perhaps the assumptions are about the properties required for a point to be on the boundary. For example:\n\n- A point c is on the boundary of the Mandelbrot set if it is neither in the interior nor the exterior.\n- The cardioid parametrization c = e^{it}(2 - e^{it})/4 corresponds to points where the quadratic map f_c(z) = z² + c has a neutral fixed point.\n\nBut I think the user wants the assumptions to be as per the problem statement, not adding external knowledge. The original question just states that the boundary contains the cardioid and asks how to prove it. So maybe the only assumption is the parametrization of the cardioid. But the example included assumptions from the problem's statement. The original example's problem had \"for every integer n\", which became an assumption that n is an integer. Then, maybe the other assumption was incorrect.\n\nIn any case, to format this problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The Mandelbrot set is defined as the set of complex numbers c for which the iteration z_{n+1} = z_n² + c remains bounded starting from z_0 = 0.\n- The boundary of the Mandelbrot set includes points where small perturbations of c lead to escaping or non-escaping orbits.\n- The cardioid in question is parameterized by c = e^{it}(2 - e^{it})/4 where t is a real number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the boundary of the Mandelbrot set contains the cardioid c = e^{it}(2 - e^{it})/4.\n\nBut maybe the key assumptions are just about the cardioid's parametrization and the Mandelbrot set's definition. However, the example only listed two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So maybe in this case, the assumptions are:\n\n- c is a complex number.\n- The Mandelbrot set's boundary is considered.\n- The cardioid is given by c = e^{it}(2 - e^{it})/4.\n\nBut each assumption should address one property or condition of one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- c is a complex number parameterizing the boundary of the Mandelbrot set.\n- The cardioid is defined by the equation c = e^{it}(2 - e^{it})/4 with real parameter t.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the boundary of the Mandelbrot set contains the cardioid c = e^{it}(2 - e^{it})/4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is self-contained, and the only assumption is the parametrization. But following the example, even if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", the formatted assumptions include \"n is an integer\" and another condition. So here, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- The Mandelbrot set is defined as the set of complex numbers c where the sequence z_{n+1} = z_n² + c remains bounded starting from z_0 = 0.\n- The boundary of the Mandelbrot set is the topological boundary of this set.\n- The cardioid is parameterized by c = e^{it}(2 - e^{it})/4 where t is a real number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the boundary of the Mandelbrot set contains the cardioid c = e^{it}(2 - e^{it})/4.\n\nThis seems reasonable. Each assumption is a single property applied to one object. The first two lines define the Mandelbrot set and its boundary, the third gives the cardioid's parametrization.",
