    "Content": "This is a question from the free Harvard online abstract algebra lectures .  I'm posting my solutions here to get some feedback on them.  For a fuller explanation, see this post. This problem is from assignment 4. Prove that the transpose of a permutation matrix $P$ is its inverse. A permutation matrix $P$ has a single 1 in each row and a single 1 in each column, all other entries being 0.  So column $j$ has a single 1 at position $e_{i_jj}$.  $P$ acts by moving row $j$ to row $i_j$ for each column $j$.  Taking the transpose of $P$ moves each 1 entry from $e_{i_jj}$ to $e_{ji_j}$.  Then $P^t$ acts by moving row $i_j$ to row $j$ for each row $i_j$.  Since this is the inverse operation, $P^t=P^{-1}$. Again, I welcome any critique of my reasoning and/or my style as well as alternative solutions to the problem. Thanks.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "A direct computation is also fine:\n$$(PP^T)_{ij} = \\sum_{k=1}^n P_{ik} P^T_{kj} = \\sum_{k=1}^n P_{ik} P_{jk}$$\nbut $P_{ik}$ is usually 0, and so $P_{ik} P_{jk}$ is usually 0.  The only time $P_{ik}$ is nonzero is when it is 1, but then there are no other $i' \\neq i$ such that $P_{i'k}$ is nonzero ($i$ is the only row with a 1 in column $k$). In other words,\n$$\\sum_{k=1}^n P_{ik} P_{jk} = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } i = j \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}$$\nand this is exactly the formula for the entries of the identity matrix, so\n$$PP^T = I$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's take a look at this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original question is about proving that the transpose of a permutation matrix is its inverse. Let me parse through the information provided.\n\nFirst, the title is \"The transpose of a permutation matrix is its inverse.\" The question itself starts by mentioning it's from a Harvard course, but that's probably irrelevant. The user provides their own solution and asks for feedback, but again, that's part of the original post's context, not the problem itself.\n\nThe key parts here are the problem statement: \"Prove that the transpose of a permutation matrix P is its inverse.\" Then, there's a description of a permutation matrix: it has a single 1 in each row and column, with the rest 0s. The user also explains their reasoning about how P acts by moving rows, and the transpose moves them back, which they claim is the inverse operation.\n\nNow, following the example given, I need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object. Then state the problem clearly.\n\nAssumptions here would be about the permutation matrix P. The properties are: P is a permutation matrix, which means each row has exactly one 1, each column has exactly one 1, all other entries are 0. Also, the problem is to show that the transpose of P is its inverse. So the transpose is another matrix, and we need to prove that multiplying P by its transpose gives the identity matrix.\n\nWait, but in the original example, the assumption included conditions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, the assumptions are about the permutation matrix. Let me list them one by one.\n\nFirst, P is a permutation matrix. Then, each row of P has exactly one 1. Each column of P has exactly one 1. All other entries of P are 0. These are three separate conditions. However, the definition of a permutation matrix is that it's a square matrix with exactly one 1 in each row and each column and 0s elsewhere. So maybe I can combine some, but according to the example, each assumption should be a single property applied to one object. So perhaps breaking them down.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the user had two assumptions: \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, the main object is the permutation matrix P. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- P is a permutation matrix.\n- Each row of P contains exactly one entry equal to 1.\n- Each column of P contains exactly one entry equal to 1.\n- All other entries of P are 0.\n\nBut perhaps that's redundant because being a permutation matrix already implies those conditions. However, the problem statement might need to have the definition of a permutation matrix as assumptions. Since the problem is to prove that the transpose is the inverse, the necessary assumptions are the properties of P that make it a permutation matrix. So maybe list those properties as separate assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is given that P is a permutation matrix (defined by those properties), then the assumption is simply that P is a permutation matrix, and the properties are part of the definition. But the example given in the user's instruction shows that the assumptions are split into individual conditions. For example, in the sample problem, the user split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the problem might state \"for every integer n divisible by 7\".\n\nBut in this case, the problem says \"Prove that the transpose of a permutation matrix P is its inverse.\" So the definition of a permutation matrix is part of the problem's premise. Therefore, the assumptions should include the defining properties of a permutation matrix. Since the problem is about permutation matrices, we need to state what a permutation matrix is as assumptions.\n\nIn the original problem statement, the user says: \"A permutation matrix P has a single 1 in each row and a single 1 in each column, all other entries being 0.\" So that's the definition. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- P is a permutation matrix.\n- Each row of P contains exactly one entry equal to 1.\n- Each column of P contains exactly one entry equal to 1.\n- All other entries of P are 0.\n\nBut perhaps the first assumption (P is a permutation matrix) already encompasses the next three. However, to follow the example's structure where each assumption is a single property, maybe we need to list them separately. However, in the example, the assumptions were \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". The problem was about divisibility by 91, and the original problem mentioned \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem included \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Wait, let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem's assumptions are \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" But that seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so n is any integer, but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That suggests maybe the user's example has an error. Wait, perhaps I need to check the example again.\n\nWait the user's example:\n\nOriginal problem:\nProve that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nWait, this seems contradictory. The original problem states \"for every integer n\", which means n is any integer. But the formatted problem adds an assumption that \"n is divisible by 7\", which was not in the original problem. That seems like a mistake. Perhaps the user intended to have a different example. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a condition that n is divisible by 7, but in the example provided, the original problem does not state that. Therefore, this suggests that perhaps the user wants the assumptions to include any conditions that are necessary, even if implicit. But in the case of the permutation matrix problem, the assumptions are the defining properties of a permutation matrix.\n\nBut going back, the problem is to structure the Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The user provided their own example where they took an original problem and formatted it with assumptions and the problem. However, their example seems to have added an assumption not present in the original problem. That suggests that perhaps the user made an error, but we have to follow their format.\n\nBut in the current problem, the original question states: \"Prove that the transpose of a permutation matrix P is its inverse.\" Then the user describes the permutation matrix as having single 1s in each row and column. So to structure this, the assumptions are the properties of a permutation matrix. Therefore, the assumptions should list each property:\n\n1. P is a permutation matrix.\n2. Each row of P contains exactly one entry equal to 1.\n3. Each column of P contains exactly one entry equal to 0. Wait, no. The problem says \"all other entries being 0\", so after the 1s, the rest are 0s. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- P is a permutation matrix.\n- Each row of P contains exactly one entry equal to 1.\n- Each column of P contains exactly one entry equal to 1.\n- All other entries of P are 0.\n\nBut maybe the first assumption (P is a permutation matrix) is redundant if we list the other three, since those three properties define a permutation matrix. However, in the example provided by the user, they included both \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So perhaps in their formatting, they want to list all assumptions explicitly, even if some are part of the definition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the problem about permutation matrices, the only assumption is that P is a permutation matrix, and the rest are part of the definition. But since the user's example broke down the assumptions into individual properties, perhaps we need to do the same here.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would have the following assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\nP is a permutation matrix,\nEach row of P contains exactly one entry equal to 1,\nEach column of P contains exactly one entry equal to 1,\nAll other entries of P are 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the transpose of P is its inverse.\n\nBut wait, in the original problem, the user also mentions that P acts by moving row j to row i_j, and the transpose moves them back. But that's part of their reasoning, not the problem statement. The problem itself, as stated, is just to prove that the transpose of a permutation matrix P is its inverse, given the definition of a permutation matrix.\n\nTherefore, the key assumptions are the properties defining a permutation matrix. So each of those properties should be listed as separate assumptions, as per the example where each assumption is one line, one property.\n\nHence, the final formatted problem would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nP is a permutation matrix,\nEach row of P contains exactly one entry equal to 1,\nEach column of P contains exactly one entry equal to 1,\nAll other entries of P are 0.\nProblem: \nProve that the transpose of P is its inverse.\n###END_OF_FORMAT###\n\nI think that's the correct breakdown. Each assumption addresses a single property of P. The problem is to show the transpose is the inverse.",
