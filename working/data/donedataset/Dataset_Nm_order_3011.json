    "AcceptedAnswer": "As julien pointed out, what follows is not a proof that $$\\sup_{x\\neq0}\\frac{||Ax||}{||x||}=\\sup_{||y||=1}||Ay||,\\quad\\quad(1)$$ it is a discussion about the consequences of $(1)$. For a proof of $(1)$ see MichaelNgelo's answer. $(1)$ implies that if we know that a given vector achieves either of the two supremums in $(1)$, then we can deduce from it a vector that achieves the other supremum. Specifically, $x^*$ is such that $$\\frac{||Ax^*||}{||x^*||}=\\sup_{x\\neq0}\\frac{||Ax||}{||x||}\\quad\\quad(*)$$ if and only if $y^*:=\\frac{x^*}{||x^*||}$ is such that $$||Ay^*||=\\sup_{||y||=1}||Ay||.\\quad\\quad(**)$$ The above is useful because it allows to compute one of the supremums by computing the other instead, in particular, we can substitute a supremum over $\\mathbb{R}\\backslash \\{0\\}$ with one over the unit sphere. An easy way to argue the above is by contradiction. For example, one direction follows from: Suppose that $x^*$ satisfies $(*)$, but $y^*:=\\frac{x^*}{||x^*||}$ does not satisfy $(**)$. Then, there exists some $\\hat{y}\\neq y^*$ such that  $||\\hat{y}||=1$ and $$||A\\hat{y}||>||Ay^*||\\Rightarrow \\frac{||A\\hat{y}||}{1}=\\frac{||A\\hat{y}||}{||\\hat{y}||}>||Ay^*||=\\left|\\left|A\\frac{x^*}{||x^*||}\\right|\\right|=\\frac{||Ax^*||}{||x^*||}=\\sup_{x\\neq0}\\frac{||Ax||}{||x||}$$ which gives a contradiction. EDIT: The $\\sup$ is taken in order to make the function $\\sigma$, that maps from the vector space of real $n\\times n$ matrices, $M_n(\\mathbb{R})$, to $[0,\\infty)$, and is defined as $$\\sigma(A):=\\sup_{x\\neq 0}\\frac{||Ax||}{||x||},$$ be a norm (that is, satisfy the norm axioms ) on $M_n(\\mathbb{R})$. If we drop the sup and instead use a fixed $x$, then $\\sigma$ doesn't satisfy the first axiom ($\\sigma(A)=0\\Leftrightarrow A=0)$ any more.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user is confused about why the two expressions for the matrix norm are equal: the supremum of ||Ax||/||x|| over all non-zero x, and the supremum of ||Ax|| when ||x|| = 1. They also ask why we take the supremum in the definition of the norm.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the definitions of vector norms and induced matrix norms. A vector norm ||x|| assigns a length to a vector x in R^n. The induced matrix norm ||A|| is defined as the maximum factor by which the matrix A can stretch a vector x. So mathematically, that's sup_{x ≠ 0} ||Ax|| / ||x||. \n\nThe question is why this is equivalent to taking the supremum over all x with ||x|| = 1. Let me think. If I take any non-zero x, then I can write x as ||x|| * (x / ||x||). Here, x / ||x|| is a unit vector. Let's call that unit vector u. Then Ax = A(||x|| u) = ||x|| Au. So ||Ax|| = ||x|| * ||Au||. Therefore, ||Ax|| / ||x|| = ||Au||. So, for any non-zero x, the ratio ||Ax||/||x|| is equal to ||Au|| where u is a unit vector. Hence, the supremum over all non-zero x is the same as the supremum over all unit vectors u. That makes sense. Therefore, the two expressions are equal because scaling x to be a unit vector doesn't change the ratio.\n\nWait, but why can we take the supremum over x with ||x|| = 1 instead of all x ≠ 0? Because every non-zero x can be scaled to a unit vector, and the ratio ||Ax||/||x|| is invariant under scaling of x. So the maximum value of the ratio occurs somewhere on the unit sphere. Therefore, the two suprema are equal.\n\nAs for why we take the supremum in the definition of the norm, it's because we want the maximum stretching factor. The matrix norm should represent the \"maximum\" effect the matrix can have on any vector, which is captured by taking the supremum over all possible non-zero vectors. If we didn't take the supremum, we might get a value that doesn't represent the matrix's maximum capability.\n\nLet me check if there are any assumptions here. The problem states that A is a matrix in M_n(R), so each matrix is n x n with real entries. The vector x is in R^n, and we're using the standard norm (though the specific norm isn't mentioned, but induced norms depend on the choice of vector norm). However, the problem doesn't specify any particular norm, so the assumption would be that we're dealing with a general vector norm. Wait, but in the problem statement, they just mention ||x|| and ||Ax|| without specifying which norm. So maybe the result holds for any vector norm? Hmm.\n\nBut the key point is that the equality holds for any vector norm. The reason is the scaling argument: any non-zero vector can be normalized, and the ratio is preserved. So the assumptions are that A is a real n x n matrix, x is a non-zero vector in R^n, and the norm is a valid vector norm. However, the problem as stated in the original question doesn't mention any restrictions on the norm, so perhaps the assumptions are implicit. But in the formatted problem example, the assumptions were listed explicitly. So for this problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- A is a real n×n matrix (since A ∈ M_n(R))\n- x is a non-zero vector in R^n (since x ≠ 0)\n- The norm used is a vector norm on R^n\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user didn't specify any particular conditions on A or x other than A being in M_n(R) and x in R^n. The equality of the suprema is a general result for any induced matrix norm. So the main assumptions here are:\n\n1. A is an n×n real matrix.\n2. The norm ||·|| is a vector norm on R^n.\n3. The supremum is taken over all non-zero vectors x in R^n (for the left-hand side) or over all unit vectors x in R^n (for the right-hand side).\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user is asking why the two suprema are equal. So the problem is to prove that equality. Therefore, in the assumptions, we need to list all the conditions given in the problem. Let's check the original problem again:\n\nOriginal question says: For every matrix A ∈ M_n(R), sup_{x≠0} ||Ax||/||x|| = sup_{||x||=1} ||Ax||. Why we are taking ||x||=1? Is there any proof? Also, why take sup in the definition?\n\nSo the problem is to prove the equality of the two suprema for any real n×n matrix A. The assumptions here would be that A is a real n×n matrix, x is a non-zero vector in R^n, and the norm is a valid vector norm. However, in the example given in the user's format, the assumptions were more about the conditions on the variables (like n being an integer and divisible by 7). Here, the key points are:\n\n- A is a real n×n matrix.\n- The norm is a vector norm on R^n.\n- x is a vector in R^n.\n\nBut the problem is to show the equality of the two suprema. So in the assumption part, perhaps list the properties that are given or needed. The problem doesn't state any particular constraints beyond A being a matrix and x being a vector. However, since the equality holds generally for any induced norm, the assumptions would just be the basic setup. Maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nA is an n×n real matrix,\nThe norm ||·|| is a vector norm on R^n,\nx is a non-zero vector in R^n.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sup_{x \\neq 0} \\frac{\\|Ax\\|}{\\|x\\|} = \\sup_{\\|x\\| = 1} \\|Ax\\|.$$\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to understand why the two expressions are equal, given the definitions. So the assumptions are the standard ones for matrix norms. Since the user is asking for the proof of the equality, the problem is to show that these two suprema are the same. Therefore, the formatted problem would list the necessary conditions (A is a real matrix, x is a vector in R^n, norm is a vector norm), and the problem is to prove the equality.",
