    "Content": "I tried to prove the following. Please could somebody tell me if my proof is correct? Let $f: [a,b]\\to \\mathbb R$ be Riemann integrable. Then changing one\n  value of $f$ then $f$ is still integrable and it integrates to the\n  same value. My proof. Let $x \\in [a,b]$ denote the point where $f$ is changed. Let $\\widetilde{f}$ denote the new function with $\\widetilde{f}(x) = z$ and the old function is $f(x) = y$. Let $M = |y-z|$. Let $\\varepsilon > 0$. Let $U(f,P)$ denote the upper sum and $L(f,P)$ the lower sum for partition $P$. Since $f$ is integrable there exists a partition $P$ such that the upper sums minus the lower sums are less than epsilon: $$ U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \\varepsilon $$ Let $Q$ be the refinement of $P$ consisting of $P$ and $\\{x-{\\varepsilon \\over 2M}, x + {\\varepsilon \\over 2M}\\}$. Then $U(f,P) \\ge U(f,Q)$ and $L(f,P) \\le L(f,Q)$. Furthermore, $|U(f,Q)-U(\\widetilde{f},Q)| \\le {\\varepsilon \\over M}\\cdot M = \\varepsilon$. This is true because $f$ and $\\widetilde{f}$ only differ at $x$ and at $x$ they can maximally differ by $M$. Since the partition $Q$ contains the interval $(x- {\\varepsilon \\over 2M}, x + {\\varepsilon \\over 2M})$ and this interval has lenght ${\\varepsilon \\over M}$ the maximal difference of these sums can be only $\\varepsilon$. Similarly, $|L(f,Q)-L(\\widetilde{f},Q)| \\le \\varepsilon$. Hence $$ |U(\\widetilde{f},Q) - L(\\widetilde{f},Q)| \\le |U(\\widetilde{f},Q) - U(f,Q)| + |U(f,Q) - L(f,Q)| +  |L(f,Q) - L(\\widetilde{f},Q)| \\le \\varepsilon $$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Yes, your proof is fine; the only error is that your final estimate should have $3\\epsilon$ instead of $\\epsilon$, but this doesn't change the conclusion at all. Here's an alternate way to proceed: It suffices to prove that a function which is zero except at a point is integrable, and that the integral is zero - It's true that the sum of integrable functions is integrable, and the integral of the sum is the sum of the integrals. Then simply notice that $\\overline f$ is the sum of $f$ and such a function. Now to do this, we can assume without loss of generality that $g$ is a function on $[0,1]$ such that $g(c) = M > 0$ for some $c \\in [0,1]$, and $0$ otherwise. Clearly, if $Q$ is any partition of $[0,1]$, then $L(g, Q) \\ge 0$. Furthermore, if we let $\\epsilon > 0$ and consider the partition $$Q = \\left\\{0, c - \\frac{\\epsilon}{2M}, c + \\frac{\\epsilon}{2M}, 1\\right\\}$$ with the obvious modifications if $c$ is too small / large, then $$U(g, Q) = 2 \\frac{\\epsilon}{2M} \\cdot M = \\epsilon$$ so that the upper integral of $g$ is at most $\\epsilon$. Since $\\epsilon$ was arbitrary, the upper integral is zero. Since the lower integral is at least $0$, and is bounded by the upper integral, they're both zero - and we're done.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this Math Stack Exchange question. The user wants to prove that changing one point of a Riemann integrable function doesn't affect its integrability or the integral's value. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The original function f is Riemann integrable on [a, b]. Then, they change one value at some point x in [a, b], resulting in a new function tilde f. The goal is to show tilde f is still integrable and the integral remains the same.\n\nLooking at the user's proof, they use partitions and consider upper and lower sums. They mention refining the partition around the changed point x with intervals of length ε/(2M), where M is the difference between the old and new function values. They argue the difference in upper and lower sums between f and tilde f is bounded by ε, hence the integral remains the same.\n\nNow, structuring this into the required format. The problem's assumptions should list each condition. The function f is Riemann integrable on [a,b], the modified function tilde f differs from f at exactly one point x in [a,b]. Then, the problem is to prove that tilde f is Riemann integrable and has the same integral as f.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is on a separate line and addresses one property. The problem statement should clearly state what needs to be proven. The example given in the prompt helps; for instance, in the example, assumptions are about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the key assumptions are the integrability of f and the single-point modification. The problem is to show integrability and equality of the integral for the modified function.",
