    "Content": "It turns out that, $$\n\\sum_k \\binom{m}{k}\\binom{n}{k}\\binom{m+n+k}{k} = \\binom{m+n}{n} \\binom{m+n}{m}\n$$ where $\\binom{m}{n}=0$ if $n>m$ . One can run hundreds of computer simulations and this result always holds. Is there a mathematical proof for this? Note 1 : This sum is the discrete version of the following integral, $$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}  \\binom{m}{ax} \\binom{n}{ax} \\binom{m+n+ax}{ax}dx\n=\\frac{1}{a} \\binom{m+n}{m}^2\n$$ where $m,n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ , $a \\in (0,1)$ and, $$\n\\binom{y}{x}:=\\frac{\\Gamma(1+y)}{\\Gamma(1+x)\\Gamma(1+y-x)}\n$$ is the continuous version of the binomial coefficient.\nThis integral was posted here . Note 2 : Thanks to epi163sqrt for his brilliant application of  Egorychev's method. One question is: can this approach be extended to the continuous binomial coefficient? For the discrete binomial coefficient we have, $$\n\\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\\oint_{\\vert z \\vert=1} \\frac{(1+z)^k}{z^{j+1}} dz = \\binom{k}{j}\n$$ since, $$\n(1+z)^k = \\sum_i \\binom{k}{i} z^i\n$$ and therefore $a_{-1}=\\binom{k}{j}$ . If one was to start with something like these two equations for the continuous binomial coefficient then Egorychev's method could be used for integrals.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Note: Don Knuth et al. tell us in section 5.5 of Concrete Mathematics :\nBinomial coefficients are like chameleons , changing their appearance easily. Here are two variations based upon the same technique and underpinning the statement above. They might also be of interest for comparison. In fact these are special cases of instructive derivations answered by @MarkoRiedel some time ago. He has provided a great collection of worked out problems as pdf file (Egorychev) in his profile at this site. We use the coefficient of operator $[z^k]$ to denote the coefficient of $z^k$ of a series. This way we can write for instance \\begin{align*}\n\\binom{m}{k}=[z^{k}](1+z)^m=[z^{m-k}]\\frac{1}{(1-z)^{k+1}}\\tag{1.1}\n\\end{align*} where we also use the binomial series expansion and the binomial identity \\begin{align*}\n\\binom{-p}{q}=\\binom{p+q-1}{q}(-1)^q\\tag{1.2}\n\\end{align*} Variation 1: We obtain \\begin{align*}\n\\color{blue}{\\sum_{k\\geq 0}}&\\color{blue}{\\binom{m+n+k}{k}\\binom{m}{k}\\binom{n}{k}}\\\\\n&=\\sum_{k\\geq 0}\\binom{m}{k}[z^{n-k}](1+z)^n[w^{m+n}](1+w)^{m+n+k}\\tag{2.1}\\\\\n&=[z^n](1+z)^n[w^{m+n}](1+w)^{m+n}\\sum_{k\\geq 0}\\binom{m}{k}\\left(z(1+w)\\right)^k\\tag{2.2}\\\\\n&=[z^n](1+z)^n[w^{m+n}](1+w)^{m+n}\\left((1+z)+zw\\right)^m\\\\\n&=[z^n][w^{m+n}](1+w)^{m+n}\\sum_{k=0}^m\\binom{m}{k}(zw)^k(1+z)^{m+n-k}\\\\\n&=\\sum_{k=0}^m\\binom{m}{k}[z^{n-k}](1+z)^{m+n-k}[w^{m+n-k}](1+w)^{m+n}\\\\\n&=\\sum_{k=0}^m\\binom{m}{k}\\binom{m+n-k}{n-k}\\binom{m+n}{m+n-k}\\tag{2.3}\\\\\n&=\\binom{m+n}{m}\\sum_{k=0}^n\\binom{m}{k}\\binom{n}{n-k}\\tag{2.4}\\\\\n&\\,\\,\\color{blue}{=\\binom{m+n}{m}^2}\n\\end{align*} and the claim follows. Comment: In (2.1) we use $\\binom{p}{q}=\\binom{p}{p-q}$ and apply (1.1). In (2.2) we apply the rule $[z^{p-q}]A(z)=[z^p]z^qA(z)$ and do some rearrangements. In (2.3) we use the binomial identity \\begin{align*}\n\\binom{m+n-k}{n-k}\\binom{m+n}{m+n-k}&=\\frac{(m+n-k)!}{(n-k)!m!}\\,\\frac{(m+n)!}{(m+n-k)!k!}\\\\\n&=\\binom{m+n}{m}\\binom{n}{n-k}\n\\end{align*} In (2.4) we apply Vandermonde's identity .

In (3.4) we expand the series using the binomial series expansion . In (3.5) we use the binomial identity form (1.2). In (3.6) we select the coefficent of $w^n$ . In (3.7) we use the binomial identity from (1.2).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this Math Stack Exchange question and structure it according to the given format. First, I need to filter out the unrelated information and focus on the core assumptions and problem.\n\nThe original title is \"Binomial Coefficient Recurrence Relation\". The main question is about proving a combinatorial identity involving binomial coefficients. The user presents a sum that equals a product of binomial coefficients and mentions that computer simulations support this result. They also ask for a mathematical proof.\n\nLooking at the problem statement: the sum over k of the product of three binomial coefficients (binomial(m,k), binomial(n,k), binomial(m+n+k,k)) equals the product of binomial(m+n,n) and binomial(m+n,m). There's an assumption that binomial coefficients where the lower index exceeds the upper index are zero. That's an important condition to note.\n\nThen there are two notes. Note 1 talks about a discrete version of an integral involving continuous binomial coefficients, but the user's main question is about the discrete sum. Note 2 mentions someone's approach using Egorychev's method and a question about extending it to continuous cases, but again, the primary problem is the discrete sum proof.\n\nSo, to structure this:\n\nAssumptions should include that m and n are non-negative integers (since binomial coefficients are involved, and typically m and n are integers here). Also, the condition that binomial(m,n) is zero if n > m. The problem is to prove the given identity. The integral part and the continuous binomial coefficients are additional context but not part of the core problem. The user's main request is about the discrete case proof, so the integral and continuous aspects can be filtered out as unrelated for the structured problem.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user does mention the integral as a note, but the problem itself is the sum equality. The assumptions would be the definitions of binomial coefficients where if the lower index exceeds the upper, it's zero. Also, m and n are integers, probably non-negative, since binomial coefficients are usually defined for non-negative integers. So the assumptions should list that binomial(m,k) is zero if k > m, similarly for binomial(n,k) and binomial(m+n+k,k). But maybe since binomial coefficients with lower index exceeding upper are zero by definition, but the user explicitly states it, so that's an assumption to include.\n\nSo the structured problem would have:\n\nAssumptions:\n- For all integers m, n, k, binomial(m, k) = 0 if k > m,\n- For all integers m, n, k, binomial(n, k) = 0 if k > n,\n- For all integers m, n, k, binomial(m + n + k, k) = 0 if k > m + n + k (which is always false, so maybe that's redundant, but the user mentions binomial(m + n + k, k) so perhaps we need to note that binomial coefficients with lower index exceeding upper are zero.\n\nWait, but binomial(m + n + k, k) can't have k > m + n + k since that would imply 0 > m + n, but m and n are non-negative integers. So that term is always non-zero? But maybe the user includes the general definition, so to cover all cases, the assumption is that each binomial coefficient is zero when the lower index exceeds the upper. However, in the problem statement, the user mentions \"where binomial(m,n)=0 if n>m\", so that's part of the problem's given conditions.\n\nSo the main assumptions are that the binomial coefficients are defined such that they are zero when the lower index exceeds the upper. The problem is to prove the identity. The rest about integrals and continuous coefficients are additional notes, not part of the core problem. The user is asking for a proof of the discrete sum identity.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have assumptions about the binomial coefficients being zero when lower exceeds upper, and the problem is to prove the sum equals the product of binomial coefficients.",
