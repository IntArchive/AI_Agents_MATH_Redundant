    "Content": "This about the famous article Zermelo, E., Beweis, daß jede Menge wohlgeordnet werden kann , Math. Ann. 59 (4), 514–516 (1904), available here . Edit: Springer link to the original (OCR'ed, may be behind a paywall) An English translation can be found in the book Collected Works/Gesammelte Werke by Ernst Zermelo. Alternative source: the book From Frege to Gödel: a source book in mathematical logic, 1879-1931 , by Jean Van Heijenoort. [See also this interesting text by Dan Grayson.] I don't understand the paragraph on the last page whose English translation is Accordingly, to every covering $\\gamma$ there corresponds a definite well-ordering of the set $M$, even if the well-orderings that correspond to two distinct coverings are not always themselves distinct. There must at any rate exist at least one such well-ordering, and every set for which the totality of subsets, and so on, is meaningful may be regarded as well-ordered and its cardinality as an \"aleph\". It therefore follows that, for every transfinite cardinality, \n  $$\\mathfrak m=2\\mathfrak m=\\aleph_0\\,\\mathfrak m=\\mathfrak m^2,\\mbox{and so forth;}$$\n  and any two sets are \"comparable\"; that is, one of them can always be mapped one-to-one onto the other or one of its parts. It seems to me Zermelo says that the fact that any set can be well-ordered immediately implies that any infinite cardinal equals its square. Is this interpretation correct? If it is, what is the argument? Side question: What is, in a nutshell, the history of the statement that any infinite cardinal equals its square? Where was it stated for the first time? Where was it proved for the first time? (In a similar vein: where was the comparability of any two cardinal numbers proved for the first time?) Edit: German original of the passage in question: Somit entspricht jeder Belegung $\\gamma$ eine ganz bestimmte Wohlordnung der Menge $M$, wenn auch nicht zwei verschiedenen Belegungen immer verschiedene. Jedenfalls muß es mindestens eine solche Wohlordnung geben, und jede Menge, für welche die Gesamtheit der Teilmengen usw. einen Sinn hat, darf als eine wohlgeordnete, ihre Mächtigkeit als ein „Alef“ betrachtet werden. So folgt also für jede transfinite Mächtigkeit\n  $$\\mathfrak m=2\\mathfrak m=\\aleph_0\\,\\mathfrak m=\\mathfrak m^2\\text{ usw.,}$$\n  und je zwei Mengen sind miteinander „vergleichbar“, d. h. es ist immer die eine ein-eindeutig abbildbar auf die andere oder einen ihrer Teile.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The following is a theorem of $ZF$: The axiom of choice holds if and only if for every infinite set $A$, there exists a bijection of $A$ with $A\\times A$. (i.e. $|A|=|A|^2$) Let us overview the theorem of Zermelo, namely if the axiom of choice holds then $\\kappa=\\kappa^2$ for every infinite $\\kappa$. This is fairly simple, by the canonical well ordering of pairs. Consider $\\alpha\\times\\beta$, this can be well ordered as ordinal multiplication (that is $\\beta$ copies of $\\alpha$, i.e. lexicographical ordering), or it can be ordered as following: $$(x,y)<(w,z)\\iff\\begin{cases} \\max\\{x,y\\}<\\max\\{w,z\\}\\\\ \\max\\{x,y\\}=\\max\\{w,z\\}\\land x<w\\\\ \\max\\{x,y\\}=\\max\\{w,z\\}\\land x=w\\land y<z\\end{cases}$$ This is a well-ordering (can you see why?). Now we will prove that $\\kappa\\times\\kappa$ has the same order type as $\\kappa$, this is a proof that the two sets have the same cardinality, since similar order types induce a bijection. Firstly, it is obvious that $\\kappa$ is at most of the order type of $\\kappa\\times\\kappa$ since the order type of $\\kappa$ can be simply be written as $\\alpha\\mapsto (\\alpha,\\alpha)$. The other direction we prove by induction on $\\alpha$ that for the initial ordinal $\\omega_\\alpha$ it is true: $\\omega_\\alpha=\\omega_\\alpha\\times\\omega_\\alpha$. Fact: If $\\delta<\\omega_\\alpha$ (where $\\omega_\\alpha$ is the $\\alpha$-th initial ordinal) then $|\\delta|<\\aleph_\\alpha$. The claim is true for $\\omega_0=\\omega$ since for any $k$ the set $\\{(n,m)\\mid (n,m)<(k,k)\\}$ is finite. Therefore the order type of $\\omega\\times\\omega$ is the supremum of $\\{k_n\\mid n\\in\\omega\\}$ and $k_n$ are finite. Simply put, the order type is $\\omega$. Now assume (by contradiction) $\\alpha$ was the least ordinal such that $\\omega_\\alpha$ was a counterexample to this claim, i.e. $\\omega_\\alpha$ is strictly less than the order type of $\\omega_\\alpha\\times\\omega_\\alpha$. Let $(\\gamma,\\beta)<\\omega_\\alpha\\times\\omega_\\alpha$ be the pair of ordinals such that the order type of $\\{(\\xi,\\zeta)\\mid (\\xi,\\zeta)<(\\gamma,\\beta)\\}$ is $\\omega_\\alpha$. Take $\\delta$ such that $\\omega_\\alpha>\\delta>\\max\\{\\gamma,\\beta\\}$ then $(\\gamma,\\beta)<(\\delta,\\delta)$ and in particular $\\{(\\xi,\\zeta)\\mid (\\xi,\\zeta)<(\\delta,\\delta)\\}$ has cardinality of at least $\\omega_\\alpha$, as it extends a well order of the type $\\omega_\\alpha$. However, $\\delta<\\omega_\\alpha$ by the fact above it is of smaller cardinality, and thus that set has the cardinality $|\\delta|\\times |\\delta|=|\\delta|<\\omega_\\alpha$ by our induction assumption. Hence, a contradiction. The other direction, also known as Tarski's theorem (I managed to find that it was published around 1923, but I could not find a proper reference.) is as follows: Suppose that for all infinite $A$, there exists a bijection of $A$ with $A\\times A$ then the axiom of choice holds. The proof (which I will not bring here, as it would require a few more notations and definitions - I did give it here ) uses the concept of Hartogs number (the least ordinal which cannot be injected into $A$). The proof in its essence is: If $\\aleph(A)$ is the Hartog of $A$, \n$$A+\\aleph(A)=(A+\\aleph(A))^2=A^2+2\\cdot A\\cdot\\aleph(A)+\\aleph(A)^2\\ge A\\cdot\\aleph(A)\\ge A+\\aleph(A)$$ We then use (or prove) a theorem that if $A+\\aleph(A)=A\\cdot\\aleph(A)$ then $A$ can be well ordered. Historically, Tarski came to publish this theorem. It was rejected at first. Polish-American mathematician Jan Mycielsi relates in his article A System of Axioms of Set Theory for the Rationalists Notices AMS, February 2006 , p.209: Tarski told me the following story. He tried to publish his theorem (stated above) in the Comptes Rendus Acad. Sci. Paris but Fréchet and Lebesgue refused to present it. Fréchet wrote that an implication between two well known propositions is not a new result. Lebesgue wrote that an implication between two false propositions is of no interest. And Tarski said that after this misadventure he never tried to publish in the Comptes Rendus . Found via Wikipedia article on the axiom of choice .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object, followed by the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the original question, the user is asking about a specific paragraph from Zermelo's paper. They want to know if their interpretation is correct—that Zermelo claims the well-ordering principle implies any infinite cardinal equals its square. They also have a side question about the history of this statement and its proof.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions from the problem. The main assumption here is related to Zermelo's assertion based on the well-ordering theorem. The key points mentioned are that every set can be well-ordered, leading to conclusions about cardinal arithmetic. The problem is whether the well-ordering of sets implies that any infinite cardinal equals its square (and other equalities like 2m = m). The side questions about the history are additional but might not be part of the main problem to structure.\n\nThe assumptions should be listed as separate points. The first assumption is Zermelo's claim that every set can be well-ordered. The second is the consequence he draws about infinite cardinals. The problem is whether this implication (from well-ordering to m² = m for infinite m) is a correct interpretation and what the argument is. The side questions are separate, but the main problem is about the correctness of the interpretation and the argument behind it.\n\nWait, the example given in the user's instruction had assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So each assumption is a condition or property. Here, the assumptions are more about statements from the paper. Let me parse the original question again.\n\nThe user quotes Zermelo as saying that because every set can be well-ordered, it follows that for every transfinite cardinality, m = 2m = aleph0*m = m², etc. Then the user asks if their interpretation is correct that the well-ordering implies m = m² for infinite m, and if so, what's the argument. The side questions are about the history.\n\nSo the main problem here is to confirm whether the well-ordering principle implies that any infinite cardinal equals its square, and to explain the argument if that's the case. The assumptions would be the well-ordering principle (every set can be well-ordered) leading to the conclusion about cardinals. But in the example, assumptions were specific conditions on variables. Here, the assumption is a mathematical principle. So perhaps the assumption here is that every set can be well-ordered (the well-ordering theorem), and the problem is to show that this implies m = m² for any infinite cardinal m.\n\nSo structuring it:\n\nAssumption: Every set can be well-ordered.\n\nProblem: Prove that for any infinite cardinal m, m = 2m = ℵ₀ * m = m².\n\nBut the original question also includes \"and so forth\" implying other similar equalities, but the user specifically focuses on m = m². However, the problem as structured should probably include all the equalities mentioned (m = 2m = ℵ₀ * m = m²) since that's what Zermelo states.\n\nBut the user's main question is whether their interpretation is correct, i.e., does well-ordering imply m = m², and if so, what's the argument. So the problem would be to show that if every set can be well-ordered, then for any infinite cardinal m, m² = m (and the other equalities).\n\nBut perhaps the assumptions are the well-ordering theorem and that m is an infinite cardinal. Wait, the example in the user's instruction had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So here, maybe:\n\nAssumption: Every set can be well-ordered.\n\nAssumption: m is an infinite cardinal.\n\nProblem: Prove that m = 2m = ℵ₀ * m = m².\n\nBut in the original problem statement from the user, they quote Zermelo as deriving those equalities from the well-ordering principle. So the key assumption is the well-ordering theorem, and the problem is to show those equalities hold for any infinite cardinal m. Therefore, the formatted problem should list the assumptions as the well-ordering theorem and m being an infinite cardinal, then the problem is to prove the equalities. However, in the example, they split the assumptions into separate lines. So each assumption is a separate line. So:\n\nAssumption: Every set can be well-ordered (Well-Ordering Theorem).\n\nAssumption: m is an infinite cardinal.\n\nProblem: Prove that m = 2m = ℵ₀ * m = m².\n\nBut wait, in the example, the original problem had the assumption that n is an integer and that it's divisible by 7, but in the formatted problem, they listed both as separate assumptions, even though the original problem's A(n) was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added the divisibility by 7. Wait, the original example's problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and in the formatted problem, the assumption included that n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem didn't state that n must be divisible by 7. The example might have a mistake, but I need to follow the user's example.\n\nWait, the user's example shows that they added an assumption not present in the original problem. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the user lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Then the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. But that seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", not only those divisible by 7. Maybe the example is incorrect, but I need to follow the user's instruction regardless.\n\nSo perhaps in their example, they filtered out some conditions, but in reality, the problem was to prove it for every integer n, which would not require n being divisible by 7. But perhaps the user made a mistake there, but I should proceed as per their instruction.\n\nIn the current problem, the user is asking about Zermelo's claim that because every set can be well-ordered, then certain cardinal equalities hold. So the key assumption is the Well-Ordering Theorem, and the problem is to show that these equalities (m = 2m = ...) follow from it. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption: Every set can be well-ordered.\n\nAssumption: m is an infinite cardinal.\n\nProblem: Prove that m = 2m = ℵ₀ * m = m².\n\nBut the user also mentions \"and so forth\" and the comparability of cardinals, but their main question is about m² = m. However, the formatted problem should capture the main question as presented. The user's problem is whether Zermelo's statement implies m = m², so the problem is to prove that from the well-ordering principle. The other equalities (2m = m, etc.) are also part of Zermelo's conclusion, so they should be included.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would list the Well-Ordering Theorem as the assumption and m being an infinite cardinal, then the problem is to prove those equalities. However, in the example, the assumptions were about the variables in the problem (n being integer and divisible by 7). Here, the assumptions are more about mathematical principles. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption: The Well-Ordering Theorem holds (every set can be well-ordered).\n\nAssumption: m is an infinite cardinal number.\n\nProblem: Prove that m = 2m = ℵ₀ * m = m².\n\nBut the original problem's user is specifically questioning the implication from well-ordering to m = m². So maybe the problem should be to prove that any infinite cardinal m satisfies m² = m, given the Well-Ordering Theorem. But in Zermelo's text, multiple equalities are stated, so perhaps the problem includes all of them.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should have the assumptions as the Well-Ordering Theorem and m being an infinite cardinal, and the problem to prove those equalities.",
