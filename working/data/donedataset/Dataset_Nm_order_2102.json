    "Content": "Since userxxxxx (I don't remember the numbers) deleted his own question which I find interesting, let me repost it: Let $f,g\\in\\mathbb Z[X]$ with $\\mathrm{gcd}(f,g)=1$. Prove that the ring $\\mathbb Z[X]/(f,g)$ is finite.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Proposition. Let $f,g\\in\\mathbb Z[X]$ with $\\mathrm{gcd}(f,g)=1$. Then $\\mathbb Z[X]/(f,g)$ is finite. Proof. If $(f,g)=\\mathbb Z[X]$, then there is nothing to prove. Assume $(f,g)\\neq\\mathbb Z[X]$. Since $\\mathrm{gcd}(f,g)=1$, the elements $f,g$ form an $\\mathbb Z[X]$-sequence and therefore $\\dim\\mathbb Z[X]/(f,g)=0$, i.e. the ring $\\mathbb Z[X]/(f,g)$ is artinian. In particular, there are only finitely many maximal ideals of $\\mathbb Z[X]$ containing $(f,g)$ and their product at some power coincides with $(f,g)$. This shows that $\\mathbb Z[X]/(f,g)$ is isomorphic to a finite product of rings of the form \n$$\\mathbb Z[X]/(M^k+(f,g))\\simeq\\frac{\\mathbb Z[X]/M^k}{(\\hat{f},\\hat{g})},$$ \nwhere $M\\subset\\mathbb Z[X]$ is a maximal ideal. Thus it is enough to show that $\\mathbb Z[X]/M^k$ is a finite ring. In order to do this let's recall the form of the maximal ideals of $\\mathbb Z[X]$: $M=p\\mathbb Z[X]+u\\mathbb Z[X]$ where $p\\in\\mathbb Z$ is a prime number and $u\\in\\mathbb Z[X]$ is a polynomial irreducible modulo $p$. Obviously \n$$\\mathbb Z[X]/M\\simeq\\mathbb Z/p\\mathbb Z[X]/(\\overline{u})$$ \nis a finite field and $M^{i-1}/M^i$ are $\\mathbb Z[X]/M$-vectorspaces of finite dimension. This shows that $\\mathbb Z[X]/M^k$ is a finite ring.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to structure this problem according to the specified format. The original question is about proving that the ring ℤ[X]/(f, g) is finite given that gcd(f, g) = 1 in ℤ[X]. \n\nFirst, I need to list all assumptions. The problem states that f and g are in ℤ[X], and their gcd is 1. So each of these should be separate assumptions. Let me check the example provided. In the example, the assumptions were split into individual lines, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. \n\nSo for this problem:\n\nAssumption 1: f is an element of ℤ[X].\nAssumption 2: g is an element of ℤ[X].\nAssumption 3: The greatest common divisor of f and g in ℤ[X] is 1.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that the quotient ring ℤ[X]/(f, g) is finite. \n\nWait, but do I need to check if there are any other implicit assumptions? The original problem says \"Let f, g ∈ ℤ[X] with gcd(f, g) = 1. Prove...\" So those are the only explicit conditions. No mention of polynomials being monic or anything else. So the assumptions should be exactly those three points. \n\nAlso, in the example, even though the original problem mentioned \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem split it into two assumptions: \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So here, each condition is separated. Similarly, here, \"f is in ℤ[X]\", \"g is in ℤ[X]\", and \"gcd(f,g)=1\" are separate. \n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is only one property or condition applied to one object. So yes, each of those three is separate. \n\nSo the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is an element of ℤ[X],\ng is an element of ℤ[X],\nthe greatest common divisor of f and g in ℤ[X] is 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that the ring ℤ[X]/(f, g) is finite.\n\nI think that's all. The original problem doesn't mention any other conditions. Let me just check again. The user restated the question as \"Let f, g ∈ ℤ[X] with gcd(f, g)=1. Prove that the ring ℤ[X]/(f, g) is finite.\" So the assumptions are exactly those three. No more. So the formatted version should be correct.",
