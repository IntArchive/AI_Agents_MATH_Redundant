    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example provided shows that the original problem had some assumptions listed, even though in the example the assumption about divisibility by 7 wasn't actually part of the original problem. Wait, maybe I need to check that again.\n\nLooking at the example: the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like an error. But maybe the example is incorrect? Hmm. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in their example? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. That seems contradictory. Maybe that's intentional, like maybe the user wants me to extract assumptions even if they're not explicitly stated? But that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the example is part of the problem and the user is showing a prior example they created. Maybe the original problem in the example was different. Wait, perhaps the example is correct because the problem was to show that A(n) is divisible by 91, which factors into 7*13, so maybe the assumption that n is divisible by 7 is part of a specific case. Wait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the example's assumption might be incorrect. But maybe the user provided a faulty example. Regardless, I need to focus on the current problem they want me to process.\n\nThe current problem is from Math Stack Exchange: \"Every polynomial with real coefficients is the sum of cubes of three polynomials\". The task is to structure it into Assumption and Problem sections as per the format. \n\nFirst, the original problem states: \"Prove that every polynomial with real coefficients is the sum of three polynomials raised to the 3rd degree.\" Formally, ∀f∈ℝ[x], ∃g,h,p∈ℝ[x] such that f = g³ + h³ + p³.\n\nNow, I need to list the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let's parse the problem. The problem is about polynomials with real coefficients. The main objects here are the polynomial f and the polynomials g, h, p. \n\nAssumptions would be:\n\n- f is a polynomial with real coefficients (since the problem states \"every polynomial with real coefficients\").\n- g, h, p are polynomials with real coefficients (as per the existential quantifier in the problem statement).\n- The coefficients of g, h, p are real numbers (since they are in ℝ[x]).\n- The equation f = g³ + h³ + p³ must hold (the sum of their cubes equals f).\n\nWait, but the example had assumptions like \"$n is an integer\" and \"$n is divisible by 7\", which were specific conditions. Here, the problem is more general. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7, but the formatted problem included that as an assumption. That seems like an error. Wait, perhaps the example was part of a different problem where the user had to add an assumption, but maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to show that assumptions are all the conditions given in the problem. Wait, the original problem in the example was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. So the assumptions would be that n is an integer. But in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. That seems incorrect. Therefore, maybe the example is wrong, but the user is providing their own example. Regardless, the current problem doesn't have such hidden assumptions. The problem is straightforward: every real-coefficient polynomial can be expressed as the sum of three cubes of real-coefficient polynomials.\n\nSo, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. f is a polynomial with real coefficients.\n2. g, h, p are polynomials with real coefficients.\n3. The sum g³ + h³ + p³ equals f.\n\nWait, but the problem is to prove that such g, h, p exist for any f. So maybe the assumptions are just about f. Let's see the example again. In the example, the problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem listed assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the example is a bad example. Alternatively, maybe the user's example had a typo. For instance, maybe the original problem was \"for every integer n divisible by 7\", but in the example, it's written as \"for every integer n\". That would explain why the assumption includes divisibility by 7. But perhaps the user made a mistake. Anyway, focusing on the current problem.\n\nThe problem is: \"Prove that every polynomial with real coefficients is the sum of three polynomials raised to the 3rd degree.\" So the assumptions would be that f is in ℝ[x], and we need to find g, h, p in ℝ[x] such that f = g³ + h³ + p³. The problem doesn't state any additional conditions, so the assumptions are just the properties given in the problem statement.\n\nSo, structured as:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a polynomial with real coefficients,\ng, h, p are polynomials with real coefficients.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f can be expressed as g³ + h³ + p³.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumptions included specific conditions on n. However, in this problem, the only assumption is that f is a real polynomial, and the task is to express it as the sum of three cubes. But according to the problem statement, it's ∀f∈ℝ[x], ∃g,h,p∈ℝ[x] such that f = g³ + h³ + p³. So the assumptions would be:\n\nEach line should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nf is an element of ℝ[x],\ng is an element of ℝ[x],\nh is an element of ℝ[x],\np is an element of ℝ[x].\n\nBut maybe that's redundant. Alternatively, the problem is for every f in ℝ[x], there exist g, h, p in ℝ[x] such that f = sum of their cubes. So the assumptions are that f is in ℝ[x], and we need to find g, h, p in ℝ[x] such that the equation holds. The example's assumptions included specific conditions (like n being integer and divisible by 7), so maybe here the only assumption is that f is in ℝ[x], and the rest is part of the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem is \"every polynomial with real coefficients is the sum...\", so the main assumption is f ∈ ℝ[x]. The existence of g, h, p in ℝ[x] is part of what needs to be proven. So the assumption is only about f, and the problem is to show that such g, h, p exist.\n\nSo the correct structure would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a polynomial with real coefficients.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exist polynomials g, h, p with real coefficients such that f = g³ + h³ + p³.\n\nBut the example included multiple assumptions, even if they applied to different objects. Wait, the example's original problem was about n being any integer, but the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like an error. Maybe the user intended to have each assumption on a separate line, even if they apply to the same object. For instance, in the example, n is an integer, and also n is divisible by 7. But if the original problem was for every integer n, then the assumption shouldn't include \"n is divisible by 7\". Unless there was a mistake. But perhaps the example is not accurate. Regardless, for the current problem, following the user's instruction to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object.\n\nSo for the current problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- f is a polynomial (object: f; property: is a polynomial)\n- The coefficients of f are real numbers (object: coefficients of f; property: real)\n- g, h, p are polynomials (objects: g, h, p; property: are polynomials)\n- The coefficients of g, h, p are real numbers (objects: coefficients of g, h, p; property: real)\n\nBut that might be redundant. Alternatively, since f ∈ ℝ[x] implies f is a polynomial with real coefficients. Similarly, g, h, p ∈ ℝ[x] implies they are polynomials with real coefficients. So maybe the assumptions can be written as:\n\nAssumption:\nf ∈ ℝ[x],\ng ∈ ℝ[x],\nh ∈ ℝ[x],\np ∈ ℝ[x].\n\nBut the problem states \"for every f ∈ ℝ[x], there exist g, h, p ∈ ℝ[x] such that...\", so the only initial assumption is that f is in ℝ[x]. The existence of g, h, p in ℝ[x] is part of the conclusion. Therefore, perhaps the correct way is:\n\nAssumption:\nf is an element of ℝ[x].\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exist g, h, p ∈ ℝ[x] such that f = g³ + h³ + p³.\n\nBut according to the user's example, they listed multiple assumptions even if they were about the same object. For instance, in the example, the problem was for every integer n, and the formatted assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", which might not be correct. But maybe the user's example is not accurate. However, in the current problem, there are no additional hidden assumptions. The problem is to show that for any real polynomial f, there exist three real polynomials whose cubes sum to f.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure should be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a polynomial with real coefficients.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exist polynomials g, h, p with real coefficients such that f = g³ + h³ + p³.\n\nAlternatively, breaking down the assumptions into one line each:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a polynomial,\nThe coefficients of f are real numbers,\ng is a polynomial,\nh is a polynomial,\np is a polynomial,\nThe coefficients of g are real numbers,\nThe coefficients of h are real numbers,\nThe coefficients of p are real numbers.\n\nBut this seems overly detailed. The problem statement uses the standard notation ℝ[x], which already denotes polynomials with real coefficients. So maybe the assumption is simply:\n\nAssumption:\nf ∈ ℝ[x].\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exist g, h, p ∈ ℝ[x] such that f = g³ + h³ + p³.\n\nThis seems concise and follows mathematical notation. In the example, they used LaTeX for the problem statement, so maybe keeping it in symbols is better.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n$f \\in \\mathbb{R}[x]$\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exist $g, h, p \\in \\mathbb{R}[x]$ such that $f = g^3 + h^3 + p^3$.\n\nAlternatively, written in the same style as the example:\n\nassumption:\n$f$ is a polynomial with real coefficients.\n\nproblem:\nProve that there exist polynomials $g$, $h$, and $p$ with real coefficients such that $f = g^3 + h^3 + p^3$.\n\nThis seems to fit the format. Each assumption is a single line. The first assumption is about f being a polynomial with real coefficients. Since the problem states \"every polynomial with real coefficients\", that's the main assumption. The existence of g, h, p is part of what needs to be proven, so they don't go into assumptions. Hence, the correct formatting would list the condition on f and then state the problem.",
