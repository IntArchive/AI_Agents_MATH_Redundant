    "Content": "I want to prove: For an integrable function $f(x)$ and periodic with period $T$, for every $a \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $$\\int_{0}^{T}f(x)\\;dx=\\int_{a}^{a+T}f(x)\\;dx.$$ I tried to change the values and define $y=a+x$ so that $dy=dx$ and the limits of the integrals are as we want, but I'm not sure how to use the fact that $f(x)$ is periodic. Thanks a lot!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If $F$ is a primitive of $f$, then $$\\int_{a}^{a+T}f(x)\\ dx-\\int_{0}^{T}f(x)\\ dx$$\n$$=F(a+T)-F(a)-F(T)+F(0)$$\n$$=\\Big(F(a+T)-F(T)\\Big)-\\Big(F(a)-F(0)\\Big)$$\n$$=\\int_T^{a+T}f(x)\\ dx-\\int_0^af(x)\\ dx$$\n$$=0.$$ One checks the last equality by making the obvious change of variable, and by using the periodicity. EDIT 1. What I wrote above is how I remember the computation. Of course, it can be written like that:\n$$\n\\int_{a}^{a+T}f(x)\\ dx-\\int_{0}^{T}f(x)\\ dx=\\int_T^{a+T}f(x)\\ dx-\\int_0^af(x)\\ dx=0.\n$$ EDIT 2. Formal justification of the first equality in the above display:\n$$\n\\int_0^af(x)\\ dx+\\int_{a}^{a+T}f(x)\\ dx=\\int_{0}^{T}f(x)\\ dx+\\int_T^{a+T}f(x)\\ dx.\n$$ (This formula should appear somewhere...)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that for a periodic, integrable function f(x) with period T, the integral over any interval of length T is the same. Specifically, they need to show that ∫₀ᴛ f(x)dx = ∫ₐ^{a+T} f(x)dx for any real number a.\n\nFirst, let's recall what periodic means. A function f is periodic with period T if f(x + T) = f(x) for all x. That's key here. The integral over an interval of length T should be the same because the function repeats every T units. \n\nThe user mentioned trying a substitution y = a + x, which seems like a good start. Let's think about that substitution. If we let y = x + a, then when x = 0, y = a, and when x = T, y = a + T. So substituting, the integral becomes ∫ₐ^{a+T} f(y - a) dy. Wait, but they wanted to relate this to ∫₀ᴛ f(x)dx. Hmm, maybe another approach is needed.\n\nAlternatively, split the integral ∫ₐ^{a+T} f(x)dx into two parts: from a to T and from T to a + T, but only if a is between 0 and T. Wait, but a can be any real number. So maybe we need a more general approach.\n\nAnother idea: Since the function is periodic with period T, shifting the interval by any multiple of T doesn't change the integral. So perhaps we can express a as some integer multiple of T plus a remainder. For example, write a = k*T + b where k is an integer and 0 ≤ b < T. Then, the integral from a to a + T becomes from k*T + b to (k+1)*T + b. But because the function is periodic with period T, the integral from k*T to (k+1)*T is the same as from 0 to T. Then, the integral from k*T + b to (k+1)*T + b can be split into two parts: from k*T + b to (k+1)*T and then from (k+1)*T to (k+1)*T + b. Then, by periodicity, the first part is ∫_{b}^{T} f(x)dx and the second part is ∫_{T}^{T + b} f(x)dx = ∫_{0}^{b} f(x)dx because f(x + T) = f(x). So adding those two parts gives ∫_{0}^{T} f(x)dx. Therefore, the integral over any interval of length T is the same as from 0 to T.\n\nWait, but how does substitution fit into this? Maybe using substitution in the original integral. Let me try that again. Let’s set y = x - a. Then when x = a, y = 0; when x = a + T, y = T. Then dx = dy, so the integral becomes ∫₀ᴛ f(y + a) dy. Now, we need to relate this to ∫₀ᴛ f(y) dy. But since f is periodic with period T, f(y + a) isn't necessarily equal to f(y) unless a is a multiple of T. However, the problem states that the equality holds for any a ∈ ℝ, not just multiples of T. Therefore, my previous approach of splitting the integral might be more effective.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the function f(y + a) has the same periodicity as f(y). Wait, if f is periodic with period T, then f(y + a) is also periodic with period T. But does that help? Not directly. The integral over one period should be the same regardless of the starting point. So perhaps by making a substitution that shifts the interval, but then showing that the integral remains the same.\n\nWait, another approach: The integral from a to a + T is equal to the integral from 0 to T because the difference between them is the integral from 0 to a + T minus the integral from 0 to a. So ∫ₐ^{a+T} f(x)dx = ∫₀^{a+T} f(x)dx - ∫₀^a f(x)dx. But since f is periodic, ∫₀^{a+T} f(x)dx = ∫₀^T f(x)dx + ∫_T^{a+T} f(x)dx. And by periodicity, ∫_T^{a+T} f(x)dx = ∫₀^a f(x)dx. Therefore, ∫₀^{a+T} f(x)dx = ∫₀^T f(x)dx + ∫₀^a f(x)dx. Then, subtracting ∫₀^a f(x)dx gives ∫ₐ^{a+T} f(x)dx = ∫₀^T f(x)dx. Hence, proved.\n\nThat seems like a solid approach. So the key steps are:\n\n1. Express ∫ₐ^{a+T} f(x)dx as the difference between ∫₀^{a+T} and ∫₀^a.\n2. Break ∫₀^{a+T} into ∫₀^T + ∫_T^{a+T}.\n3. Use periodicity to replace ∫_T^{a+T} with ∫₀^a.\n4. Then subtract ∫₀^a, leaving ∫₀^T.\n\nThis uses the periodicity to shift the interval [T, a+T] back to [0, a]. Therefore, the integral over any interval of length T is the same as over [0, T].\n\nSo the user's substitution y = x - a would lead to ∫₀ᴛ f(y + a) dy. But how does that relate to ∫₀ᴛ f(y) dy? If we can show that ∫₀ᴛ f(y + a) dy = ∫₀ᴛ f(y) dy, then we're done. Since f is periodic, shifting the argument by a doesn't change the integral over a full period. But wait, that's exactly what needs to be proven. So maybe this substitution approach is circular unless we can justify that shifting doesn't affect the integral over a period.\n\nAlternatively, consider that for any a, the integral ∫ₐ^{a+T} f(x)dx is equal to ∫₀^T f(x)dx. To prove this, use the substitution z = x - a, so dz = dx, limits from 0 to T, and the integral becomes ∫₀ᴛ f(z + a) dz. Now, since f is periodic with period T, f(z + a) = f(z + a - kT) where k is chosen such that a - kT is in [0, T). Wait, that's similar to the earlier splitting approach. Essentially, the function over one period can be shifted, and the integral remains the same.\n\nBut perhaps more straightforwardly, if we consider that the integral over any interval of length T must be the same because the function repeats every T. Therefore, no matter where you start integrating over an interval of length T, the integral should be the same. This is an intuitive property of periodic functions.\n\nBut to make this rigorous, the splitting method is better. Let's formalize that:\n\nLet’s write ∫ₐ^{a+T} f(x)dx = ∫ₐ^T f(x)dx + ∫_T^{a+T} f(x)dx when a < T. If a is not less than T, we can write a = kT + b where b is in [0, T), and then the integral becomes ∫_{b}^{T} f(x)dx + ∫_{T}^{b + T} f(x)dx. But due to periodicity, ∫_{T}^{b + T} f(x)dx = ∫₀^b f(x)dx. Therefore, the total integral is ∫_{b}^T + ∫₀^b = ∫₀^T f(x)dx.\n\nThus, regardless of a, the integral over [a, a+T] is the same as over [0, T].\n\nThis seems like the correct proof. So the key assumptions are that f is integrable (so the integrals exist) and periodic with period T. The problem is to show that shifting the interval of integration by any real number a doesn't change the integral over an interval of length T.",
