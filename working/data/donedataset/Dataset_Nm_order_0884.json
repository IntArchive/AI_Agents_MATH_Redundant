    "AcceptedAnswer": "One direct method is to divide directly by $5^x$ and get $1=(3/5)^x+(4/5)^x$. From here it is clear that the RHS is strictly decreasing, and there is a unique solution. Almost all exponential equations can be treated this way, by transforming them to one increasing function equal to one decreasing function one increasing/decreasing function equal to a constant.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants to prove that the equation \\(3^x + 4^x = 5^x\\) has only one real solution, which is \\(x = 2\\). \n\nFirst, I'll start by analyzing the function they mentioned, \\(f(x) = 5^x - 4^x - 3^x\\). The goal is to show that this function equals zero only at \\(x = 2\\). Using the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT) might help, but they also mentioned difficulty in determining the sign of the derivative \\(f'(x)\\), which complicates understanding the function's behavior.\n\nLet me first check the value at \\(x = 2\\): \\(5^2 - 4^2 - 3^2 = 25 - 16 - 9 = 0\\). So, that's a valid solution. Now, I need to check if there are other solutions. Maybe plugging in other integer values. For example, \\(x = 1\\): \\(5 - 4 - 3 = -2\\), which is negative. \\(x = 3\\): \\(125 - 64 - 27 = 34\\), which is positive. So between \\(x=1\\) and \\(x=3\\), the function goes from negative to positive, crossing zero at \\(x=2\\). But does it cross zero anywhere else?\n\nFor \\(x > 2\\), let's see what happens as \\(x\\) increases. The terms \\(5^x\\) grow faster than \\(4^x\\) and \\(3^x\\), so \\(f(x)\\) should continue increasing, meaning no more zeros there. What about for \\(x < 2\\)? Let's test \\(x = 0\\): \\(1 - 1 - 1 = -1\\). At \\(x = 2\\), it's zero. So between \\(x=0\\) and \\(x=2\\), it goes from -1 to 0. But maybe there's another crossing somewhere else?\n\nWait, but the derivative could tell us if the function is increasing or decreasing. The user mentioned \\(f'(x) = \\ln(5) \\cdot 5^x - \\ln(4) \\cdot 4^x - \\ln(3) \\cdot 3^x\\). If we can determine whether \\(f'(x)\\) is always positive or negative, that would help. But calculating this derivative's sign might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps dividing both sides of the original equation by \\(5^x\\) to normalize it. Let's set \\( \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^x + \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^x = 1 \\). Let me denote \\(a = \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^x\\) and \\(b = \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^x\\). Both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are decreasing functions since their bases are less than 1. As \\(x\\) increases, both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) decrease. The left-hand side (LHS) is the sum of two decreasing functions, so it's also decreasing. Therefore, there can be at most one solution where the sum equals 1. Since we already found \\(x=2\\), that's the only solution.\n\nWait, but this approach assumes that the LHS is strictly decreasing, which would imply only one solution. To confirm that the LHS is strictly decreasing, we can check its derivative. Let \\(g(x) = \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^x + \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^x\\). Then \\(g'(x) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right) \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^x + \\ln\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right) \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^x\\). Since both \\(\\ln(3/5)\\) and \\(\\ln(4/5)\\) are negative, \\(g'(x)\\) is negative for all \\(x\\). Thus, \\(g(x)\\) is strictly decreasing, so it can cross 1 at most once. Therefore, \\(x=2\\) is the only solution.\n\nAlternatively, for \\(x < 2\\), the function \\(g(x)\\) would be greater than 1 at some points? Wait, let's check \\(x = 0\\): \\(1 + 1 = 2 > 1\\). At \\(x = 2\\), it's 1. So as \\(x\\) increases from \\(-\\infty\\) to 2, \\(g(x)\\) decreases from infinity to 1. Then for \\(x > 2\\), it continues decreasing below 1. So the equation \\(g(x) = 1\\) is only satisfied at \\(x = 2\\).\n\nThis seems to confirm that there's only one real solution. So the key steps are transforming the equation and showing that the left-hand side is strictly decreasing, hence injective, leading to a unique solution. The original approach with the function \\(f(x)\\) could also work if we can show that after \\(x=2\\), \\(f(x)\\) remains positive and before \\(x=2\\), it's negative except at \\(x=2\\). However, using the substitution to \\(g(x)\\) simplifies the analysis by leveraging the monotonicity of the transformed function.",
