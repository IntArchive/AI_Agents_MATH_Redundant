    "Content": "Show that $\\sqrt{10}+\\sqrt{26}+\\sqrt{17}+\\sqrt{37} \\gt \\sqrt{341}$ . This is inspired by Showing $x+y>z$, where $x=\\sqrt{10}+\\sqrt{26}$, $y=\\sqrt{17}+\\sqrt{37}$, and $z=\\sqrt{323}$. Is my idea corect? ,\nwhere the 341 is replaced by\n323. In that problem,\nthe difference is about $0.4949$ ,\nwhich enabled a\nquite elementary proof to work. In this case,\nthe difference is about $0.00098$ ,\nwhich is much harder. So,\nis an elementary proof possible,\nother than computing the difference?

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to show that the sum of four square roots is greater than the square root of 341. The original question mentions that the difference is very small, around 0.00098, which makes it challenging compared to a similar problem with a larger difference. They’re asking if an elementary proof is possible without just computing the numerical values.\n\nFirst, I need to structure the problem according to the given format. The example provided lists assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Looking at the problem here, there are four square roots being summed: sqrt(10), sqrt(26), sqrt(17), sqrt(37), and comparing their sum to sqrt(341). The assumptions would be about each of these radicals and the inequality itself.\n\nWait, but the problem as stated doesn't have any explicit conditions or properties given other than the numbers inside the square roots. The original problem in the example had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, there's no such condition. The problem is to show the inequality holds. So maybe the assumptions are just the expressions involved? But the example included specific conditions. However, in this case, perhaps there are no additional assumptions beyond the expressions given. The problem is to compare the sum of those four square roots with sqrt(341). So the assumptions would list each of those radicals as part of the problem. Wait, but the example's assumptions were about the variables involved. Here, maybe there are no variables, just constants. So perhaps the assumptions are that each term is a positive real number, since square roots are defined as such. But maybe that's too trivial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem has no additional assumptions beyond the expressions given. The user might have intended to include the expressions as part of the problem statement, but the example included assumptions about the variable n. Here, since there's no variable, maybe there are no assumptions. Wait, but the original example included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. But in the problem here, the user is just comparing constants. So maybe the assumptions are that each square root is a real number, which they are because the radicands are positive. However, the example's assumptions were more about the problem's constraints. Since the problem here is purely numerical, maybe there are no assumptions needed other than the terms involved. Wait, but the problem is to compare the sum of those four square roots to sqrt(341). So the problem is straightforward. The original example had a problem with variables and conditions on the variable. Here, it's all constants. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions section is empty? But the format requires listing assumptions. Hmm. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem listed two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem didn't mention that n is divisible by 7. Wait, looking back, maybe the user made a mistake in their example. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem includes \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems incorrect. Unless there was a mistake in the example. Wait, maybe the user intended to structure the problem with certain assumptions even if they weren't explicit? For instance, if the problem was to prove divisibility by 91, which factors into 7 and 13, maybe the assumption is that n is such that the expression is divisible by 7 and 13. But that's not how the example was presented. Alternatively, perhaps the example was structured with incorrect assumptions. Wait, this is confusing. The user provided an example where the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That would actually change the problem from \"for every integer n\" to \"for integers n divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. But perhaps the user intended that? If so, then in the current problem, perhaps they want me to extract any hidden assumptions. But in the current problem, there are no variables; it's all constants. Therefore, maybe the assumptions are just the terms involved, but since they are constants, perhaps there are no assumptions. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that all square roots are positive, which is standard. But the example included assumptions about the variable. Since this problem has no variables, maybe the assumptions section is empty. However, the format requires it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to compare two expressions, so the assumption is that both sides are real numbers. But that's trivial. Alternatively, maybe the problem has no assumptions, and the user expects that section to be left blank. But the example includes assumptions even if they were incorrect. Hmm. Maybe the user wants me to list the components of the problem as assumptions. For instance, each square root term is part of the sum, and the sqrt(341) is the other side. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption: The problem involves the sum of √10, √26, √17, and √37.\nAssumption: The problem compares this sum to √341.\nBut that seems redundant because the problem statement already includes that. Alternatively, perhaps the assumptions are the properties required for the inequality to hold, but since it's a numerical comparison, there's no variable conditions. Therefore, maybe the assumptions section is empty. However, the format requires listing assumptions. To comply with the format, perhaps list that each term inside the square roots is positive, ensuring the square roots are real numbers. So:\n\nAssumption: 10 is a positive real number.\nAssumption: 26 is a positive real number.\nAssumption: 17 is a positive real number.\nAssumption: 37 is a positive real number.\nAssumption: 341 is a positive real number.\n\nBut this seems overly pedantic, as square roots of positive numbers are inherently real. However, following the example, which listed assumptions about the variable, even if redundant, maybe here we need to list that each radicand is positive. Alternatively, maybe the problem has no explicit assumptions beyond the given expressions, so the assumptions section would be empty. But the example shows that assumptions are extracted from the problem's conditions. Since this problem is purely numerical, there are no variables or conditions, so perhaps the assumptions are that all square roots are real numbers (which they are). Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption: √10, √26, √17, √37, and √341 are real numbers.\n\nBut that's one assumption, but the example lists each assumption line by line. Alternatively, split into each term:\n\nAssumption: √10 is a real number.\nAssumption: √26 is a real number.\nAssumption: √17 is a real number.\nAssumption: √37 is a real number.\nAssumption: √341 is a real number.\n\nBut again, this is redundant because the radicands are positive. However, following the example structure, even if the assumptions are obvious, they should be listed. Therefore, I'll proceed with that.",
