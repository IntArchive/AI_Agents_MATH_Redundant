    "Content": "Prove that for all non-negative integers $m,n$, $\\frac{(2m)!(2n)!}{m!n!(m + n)!}$ is an integer. There is a answer given here to this question here. I've seen how it can be proven using recurrence equations as well. When I was trying to solve this problem I was looking to represent it as the number of ways of counting something. Can anyone give such an example, thus proving the question another and very natural way?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Following from Grigory M's advice here is a way of interpreting these super catalan numbers as counting lattice paths. We also use part of a proof by Vladimir Nikolin when we deal with the Vandermonde Convolution Formula and Szily's identity. Szily's identity is proven by equating the $x^{2m} $ coefficient in the following expression $(1+x)^{m+n}(1-x)^{m+n}=(1-x^2)^{m+n}$ and then multiplying both sides by $\\frac{(-1)^m(2m)!(2n)!}{(m+n)!^2}$ We get $$\nS(m,n)=\\sum_k(-1)^k\\binom{2m}{m+k}\\binom{2n}{n-k}\n$$ This shows that this expression we are dealing with is an integer. It even seems to me like this is close enough to counting something, the number of ways of picking 1s from bracket expansions multiplied by a constant or something. But we can do better. Grigory M suggested considering the Vandermonde convolution formula; $$\n\\sum_k\\binom{2m}{m+k}\\binom{2n}{n-k}=\\binom{2(n+m)}{n+m}.\n$$ where the sum is over all k. This identity can be rewritten as $$\n\\sum_{k=0}\\binom{2m}{k}\\binom{2n}{m+n-k}\n$$ by letting m+k go to k Our super catalan expression is transformed into $$\nS(m,n)=\\sum_{k=0}(-1)^{k-m}\\binom{2m}{k}\\binom{2n}{m+n-k}\n$$ Now consider the following proof of the Vandermonde convolution formula;\nThe number of paths in a lattice from the origin to a point A(m+n, m+n) taking only up and right steps is $\\binom{2(m+n)}{m+n}$ (choosing which m+n steps are up steps in the 2(m+n) steps getting there) Consider the following approach to counting the number of ways;\nLook at the line x + y = 2m (the diagram is depicting the case of m instead of 2m) (source: cut-the-knot.org ) Each path crosses the line at a unique point $A_j$ There are $\\binom{2m}{k}$ ways to get to $A_j$ Then there are $\\binom{2n}{m+n-k}$ moves left to choose to get to A(m+n, m+n). So there are $\\binom{2m}{k}$$\\binom{2n}{m+n-k}$ paths that cross through $A_j$ Summing over all j gives our Vandermonde identity. Now if we look at our most recent expression for these super catalan numbers we see that it is just counting the number of paths from the origin to A(m+n, m+n) that go through an even $A_i$ minus the number that go through an odd $A_i$ or vice versa depending on the parity of m. We have interpreted this expression as counting something. It follows that it's an integer. Although I can no longer see at all why it has to be a positive integer, but sure hey, that's what the original expression is for.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to help format this problem from Math Stack Exchange according to the user's specified structure. Let me start by reading the original question carefully.\n\nThe original title is: \"An example where (2m!)(2n!)/(m!n!(m + n)!) is the number of ways of counting something?\" And the question body asks to prove that for all non-negative integers m and n, that expression is an integer. The user mentions that there's an existing answer using recurrence equations, but they want an example where this fraction represents the number of ways to count something, thereby providing a combinatorial proof.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. The problem is to find a combinatorial interpretation of the given expression, such that it counts the number of ways of doing something, which would inherently be an integer, thus proving the expression is an integer.\n\nAssumptions here would be the conditions given in the problem. The original problem states \"for all non-negative integers m, n\". So each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. In this case, m and n are non-negative integers. However, in the example provided by the user, sometimes assumptions are split into separate lines even if they apply to the same object. For instance, in the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are separate assumptions. So here, since m and n are both non-negative integers, maybe we should list each as a separate assumption.\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem was about proving divisibility by 91, and the formatted assumptions were \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But in this current problem, the assumptions are that m and n are non-negative integers. Since the problem is for all non-negative integers m and n, both variables have their own conditions. However, each assumption line should address only one property or condition applied to one object. Therefore, perhaps:\n\nAssumption: m is a non-negative integer,\n\nAssumption: n is a non-negative integer.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that the given fraction is an integer by representing it as the number of ways of counting something.\n\nBut the problem as stated in the original question is already to prove it's an integer. The user is asking for a combinatorial proof where the expression counts something. So the problem part should be phrased as requesting such an example, which would then serve as a proof.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"Can anyone give such an example, thus proving the question another and very natural way?\" So the problem is to find a combinatorial interpretation where the expression counts the number of ways of something, thereby proving it's an integer.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: m is a non-negative integer,\n\nAssumption: n is a non-negative integer,\n\nProblem: Prove that $\\frac{(2m)!(2n)!}{m!n!(m + n)!}$ is an integer by representing it as the number of ways of counting something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement is to find such a combinatorial interpretation. Let me check the example again. The example's problem was \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91.\" Here, the original problem is to prove the expression is an integer, and the user is specifically asking for a combinatorial proof via counting. So perhaps the problem should be phrased as \"Provide an example where [expression] is the number of ways of counting something, thus proving it is an integer.\"\n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"structure that problem as the following format\" where the problem is the problem statement. In the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem was to prove that, with assumptions about n. Here, the original problem is to prove the expression is an integer, and the user is asking for a combinatorial proof via counting. So the problem part should be to provide such an example (the combinatorial interpretation) which proves the expression is an integer.\n\nBut in the example, the problem is \"Prove that...\", so maybe here the problem should be \"Prove that [expression] is an integer by representing it as the number of ways of counting something.\"\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be \"Provide an example where [expression] represents the number of ways of counting something, thereby proving it is an integer.\"\n\nBut the exact original question is asking \"Can anyone give such an example, thus proving the question another and very natural way?\" So the problem is to find such an example (a combinatorial interpretation) which would serve as a proof.\n\nSo perhaps the formatted problem is:\n\nProblem: Provide an example where $\\frac{(2m)!(2n)!}{m!n!(m + n)!}$ is the number of ways of counting something, thereby proving that it is an integer for all non-negative integers $m$ and $n$.\n\nBut the user's example just states \"Prove that...\", so maybe the problem should be \"Prove that [...] is an integer by representing it as the number of ways of counting something.\"\n\nBut the original question is not exactly asking to prove it, but to find an example that proves it. Hmm. Let me check the user's example again. In their example, the original problem was \"Prove that [...] is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem had assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7, then the problem was \"Prove that [...] is divisible by 91.\"\n\nSo in this case, the original question is \"Prove that [...] is an integer\" but the user is looking for a combinatorial proof. The problem statement would then be to prove the expression is an integer by representing it as a count of something.\n\nBut the user's specific request is for the problem to be structured as Assumptions and Problem. So the assumptions are m and n are non-negative integers, and the problem is to prove that the expression is an integer by finding a combinatorial interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, the problem statement could be to provide such an example, which would be a way to prove it. However, the user's example structures the problem as \"Prove that [...] is divisible by 91.\"\n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem here should be \"Prove that [...] is an integer by representing it as the number of ways of counting something.\"\n\nBut the original question is not exactly phrased as \"prove\", but more \"Can anyone give such an example...\". However, since the user wants the problem structured, perhaps focusing on the core request: the problem is to find a combinatorial interpretation (the example) that proves the integrality. So the problem statement would be to provide such an example.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the problem is the statement to be proven. So maybe:\n\nAssumption: m is a non-negative integer,\n\nAssumption: n is a non-negative integer,\n\nProblem: Prove that $\\frac{(2m)!(2n)!}{m!n!(m + n)!}$ is an integer by representing it as the number of ways of counting something.\n\nBut the original problem is to prove that it's an integer, and the user is asking for a combinatorial proof. So the problem remains \"Prove that [...] is an integer\", but the method is via a combinatorial interpretation.\n\nHowever, the user's example included specific assumptions. In this case, the assumptions are m and n are non-negative integers. Each as separate lines.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption: m is a non-negative integer,\n\nAssumption: n is a non-negative integer,\n\nProblem: Prove that $\\frac{(2m)!(2n)!}{m!n!(m + n)!}$ is an integer by representing it as the number of ways of counting something.\n\nThat seems to fit the structure. The problem is to prove integrality via a combinatorial interpretation, with assumptions on m and n.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is to find the example (the combinatorial interpretation), then the problem statement might be phrased as: \"Provide an example where [...] is the number of ways of counting something, thus proving it is an integer.\"\n\nBut given the user's example, where the problem is \"Prove that...\", perhaps the correct structure is to have the problem as \"Prove that [...] is an integer\" with the assumptions on m and n.\n\nBut the original question's title is asking for an example where the expression counts something. So maybe the problem is to find such an example, which would serve as a proof.\n\nHowever, the user's instruction says to structure the problem as in the example, which has \"Problem: Prove that...\". Therefore, perhaps the problem here is \"Prove that [...] is an integer by representing it as the number of ways of counting something.\" Then, the assumptions are m and n being non-negative integers.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the formatted version would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: m is a non-negative integer,\nAssumption: n is a non-negative integer,\nProblem: Prove that $$\\frac{(2m)!(2n)!}{m!n!(m + n)!}$$ is an integer by representing it as the number of ways of counting something.\n###END_OF_FORMAT###\n\nThat captures the problem's requirements: the user wants to see a proof via a combinatorial interpretation, hence the problem is to prove integrality via such a representation, given m and n are non-negative integers.",
