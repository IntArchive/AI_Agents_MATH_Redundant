    "AcceptedAnswer": "Hint: if you can find $k$ so that $\\sqrt{k^2+1}$ is really close to $\\dfrac{\\pi}{2}$, then for $i$ at most $k$, $\\sqrt{k^2+i}$ will also be close to $\\dfrac{\\pi}{2}$ (Because the difference between $\\sqrt{k^2+1}$ and $\\sqrt{k^2+i}$ is at most $0.5$, since $(\\sqrt{k^2+1}+\\dfrac{1}{2})^2>k^2+k$. Now for such $k$, $\\sin(\\sqrt{k^2+i})$ for $i$ at most $k$ will be bounded below by some constant $C$(they found something that works with 1/8, but you can find one of your own). \nThen:\n$$\\sum_{n=k^2+1}^{n=k^2+k} \\dfrac{\\sin\\sqrt n}{\\sqrt n} > C \\sum_{n=k^2+1}^{n=k^2+k} \\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt n} > C \\sum_{n=k^2+1}^{n=k^2+k} \\frac{1}{k} = C$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified Assumption and Problem sections. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The user is asking about the divergence of the series sum of sin(sqrt(n))/sqrt(n) from n=1 to infinity. They mention that they've tried the 10 standard tests, but none seem to apply directly. They also found a hint suggesting to consider intervals from k²+1 to k²+k and show that each such block contributes more than 1/8. \n\nNow, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem is about the series sum of sin(sqrt(n))/sqrt(n). Let me list the assumptions. The series is sum_{n=1}^infty sin(sqrt(n))/sqrt(n). The terms are sin(sqrt(n))/sqrt(n). The series is not alternating (as per the user's note that the alternating series test doesn't apply). The nth term test isn't applicable because the limit is zero. Also, the integral test isn't applicable because the function is sometimes negative. The terms are not all positive, so comparison tests might be tricky. The user also mentions that ratio and root tests fail. \n\nWait, the problem statement might have some implicit assumptions. For example, the function sin(sqrt(n))/sqrt(n) is defined for all n ≥ 1 since sqrt(n) is real and denominator is non-zero. But maybe that's too obvious. The key assumptions here are the conditions under which the series is being tested. The problem is to show divergence, so the user is probably assuming that the series isn't absolutely convergent either. But maybe the main assumptions are about the terms and the tests not working. However, according to the example given, the assumptions should list properties or conditions applied to one object each. \n\nLooking at the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. In this case, the problem is about the series, so the assumptions would be about the terms of the series. Let's think: The series is sum sin(sqrt(n))/sqrt(n). The terms are a_n = sin(sqrt(n))/sqrt(n). The user tried several tests, which implies certain properties. For instance, since the alternating series test isn't applicable, the series isn't alternating. The nth term test isn't helpful because the limit is zero. The integral test isn't applicable because the function isn't always positive. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- The series is ∑_{n=1}^∞ [sin(√n)/√n]\n- The terms of the series are a_n = sin(√n)/√n\n- The series is not alternating (so it's not an alternating series)\n- The limit of a_n as n→∞ is 0 (so nth term test doesn't show divergence)\n- The function f(x) = sin(√x)/√x is not always non-negative (so integral test isn't applicable)\n- The ratio test and root test are inconclusive\n- Direct comparison test might be applicable but difficult\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumptions were specific to the problem's variables. The original problem here is about the divergence of the series. The user tried the 10 standard tests and they don't apply. So maybe the key assumptions are the conditions that make those tests inapplicable. But how to structure them? Each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- The series is ∑_{n=1}^∞ [sin(√n)/√n]\n- The nth term a_n = sin(√n)/√n tends to 0 as n approaches infinity\n- The function f(x) = sin(√x)/√x is not always non-negative for x ≥ 1\n- The series is not alternating\n- The ratio test for the series is inconclusive\n- The root test for the series is inconclusive\n- The integral test is not applicable to the series\n\nBut some of these might be redundant. For instance, the integral test not being applicable is due to f(x) not being non-negative. But according to the problem's original text, the user says: 4) Integral Test (Not applicable: f <0 sometimes). So the assumption here is that f(x) is sometimes negative, making the integral test not applicable.\n\nSo each assumption should be a single line, each about one property of one object.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The series under consideration is ∑_{n=1}^∞ [sin(√n)/√n]\n- For the series, the nth term a_n = sin(√n)/√n\n- The limit of a_n as n→∞ is 0\n- The function f(n) = sin(√n)/√n is sometimes negative\n- The series is not alternating\n- The integral test is not applicable to the series\n- The ratio test fails to determine convergence or divergence\n- The root test fails to determine convergence or divergence\n\nBut maybe some of these are conclusions rather than assumptions. Wait, the problem is to structure the problem as per the example. In the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer (implicit) and another that n is divisible by 7 (which was part of the problem's actual conditions). Here, the original problem states that the user has checked the 10 tests and found them not applicable. So the assumptions would be the conditions that make those tests not applicable. However, in the example, the assumption included both that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. The latter was part of the problem's specific condition. So here, perhaps the key assumptions are the properties of the series that prevent the standard tests from being applicable.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is simply to state the problem as given, with the relevant assumptions. The problem is to show divergence, and the user has already noted which tests don't work. But in the formatted problem, the assumptions are the given conditions. For example, in the example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91 under the assumption that n is an integer (maybe that's given) and n is divisible by 7. Wait, in the original example, the user had written:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Wait, the original example's formatted problem has an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the original problem didn't state that. Wait, maybe there's a typo in the example. Let me check:\n\nOriginal problem in example: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1 ) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption that n is an integer is correct, but the additional assumption that n is divisible by 7 is not in the original problem. That seems like a mistake. But maybe the user in the example made a mistake, or perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the problem was intended to have n divisible by 7, but the original problem's statement was different. Wait, perhaps the example is from another problem where the user intended to have n divisible by 7? Hmm, maybe I shouldn't dwell on that. The key is to follow the format, listing assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nIn the current problem, the user is trying to show divergence of the series. The problem's assumptions are the properties of the series that make the standard tests inapplicable, as per the user's notes. However, when structuring the problem, perhaps the main assumptions are the series itself and the conditions that complicate the application of tests. But perhaps the assumptions are not explicitly stated but derived from the problem's context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. Since the problem is to show divergence, the key assumptions would be the properties of the series that are given. For example, the series is sum sin(sqrt(n))/sqrt(n), which is given. Then, perhaps other conditions mentioned in the user's thought process: that the nth term tends to zero, the series is not alternating, etc. However, in the example, the assumptions included the divisibility by 7, which was part of the problem's conclusion. Wait, in the example, the formatted problem's assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\", but the original problem was to prove for every integer n. So perhaps there's a discrepancy. Maybe the example is incorrect, but we have to follow the user's instruction regardless.\n\nIn any case, for the current problem, the key is to list the assumptions as per the problem's conditions. The user mentions that the nth term test isn't applicable (since the limit is zero), so that's a condition. The series isn't alternating, so that's another assumption. The integral test isn't applicable because f(x) is sometimes negative. The ratio and root tests fail. The problem is to show divergence despite these conditions.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- The series is ∑_{n=1}^∞ [sin(√n)/√n]\n- The nth term a_n = sin(√n)/√n satisfies lim_{n→∞} a_n = 0\n- The terms a_n are not all non-negative\n- The series is not alternating\n- The ratio test is inconclusive for the series\n- The root test is inconclusive for the series\n\nBut maybe some of these are redundant. The user also mentions that direct comparison might be applicable but difficult, and the hint involves grouping terms between k²+1 and k²+k. However, the formatted problem should list the assumptions, not the methods. So the problem is to show divergence, given that the nth term goes to zero, the series isn't alternating, terms are sometimes negative, etc.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n- The series is ∑_{n=1}^∞ [sin(√n)/√n]\n- The nth term of the series tends to 0 as n approaches infinity\n- The terms of the series are not all non-negative\n- The series is not alternating\n- The ratio test fails to determine convergence of the series\n- The root test fails to determine convergence of the series\n\nProblem:\nShow that the series ∑_{n=1}^∞ [sin(√n)/√n] diverges.\n\nBut wait, the original problem's title is \"How to show the divergence of ∑_{n=1}^∞ sin(√n)/√n\". The user has tried several tests which didn't work and is asking for a method, possibly using the hint provided. The formatted problem should present the problem as is, with the assumptions being the conditions that make the standard tests inapplicable. So each of the inapplicable tests' conditions would be assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions are the properties of the series that the user has already checked, such as the nth term going to 0, the function f(n) being sometimes negative (making integral test inapplicable), the series not being alternating, etc.\n\nSo, in the example given by the user, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem's assumption included n being divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake unless the original problem had a typo. However, perhaps the example is incorrect, but we have to follow the user's instructions.\n\nIn any case, following the example's structure, the assumptions are the conditions given or necessary for the problem. Here, the problem is to show divergence, and the user has listed several tests that don't apply. Therefore, the assumptions would include:\n\n- The series in question is ∑_{n=1}^∞ [sin(√n)/√n]\n- The nth term test is not applicable because lim_{n→∞} a_n = 0\n- The integral test is not applicable because f(x) = sin(√x)/√x is sometimes negative\n- The series is not alternating\n- The ratio test and root test are inconclusive\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption, each addressing one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- The series is ∑_{n=1}^∞ [sin(√n)/√n]\n- The nth term a_n = sin(√n)/√n approaches 0 as n approaches infinity\n- The function f(x) = sin(√x)/√x is not always non-negative for x ≥ 1\n- The series does not alternate in sign\n- The ratio test fails to determine the convergence of the series\n- The root test fails to determine the convergence of the series\n\nProblem:\nShow that the series ∑_{n=1}^∞ [sin(√n)/√n] diverges.\n\nThis structure lists each condition as a separate assumption, as per the example. The problem then is to show divergence under these conditions.",
