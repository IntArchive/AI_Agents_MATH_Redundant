    "Content": "Let $(E,\\pi,M)$ be a holomorphic bundle, i.e. $(M,J)$ is a complex manifold and $\\pi \\colon E \\to M$ is a complex bundle such that there exists a trivialization with holomorphic transition functions. I am asked to prove that the dual vector bundle $E^* \\to M$ is also holomorphic. I am pretty sure that this is the kind of problem that should be solved looking at how transition maps change, i.e. I should probably define the dual bundle as the one having $g_{\\alpha,\\beta}^*$ as its transition functions (whatever this means) and then the result follows from the fact that a bundle can be reconstructed from its transitions functions... What I need is to express the $g_{\\alpha,\\beta}^*$ with the $g_{\\alpha,\\beta}$ to obtain that this new bundle is holomorphic. Thank you for your help!!! EDIT: Here's my attempt: suggestions, corrections and improvements are encouraged!!! 1) I define a fiber bundle $F$ with the fiber bundle construction theorem ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_bundle ) as the one having $(g_{\\alpha,\\beta}^t)^{-1}$. This is clearly a holomorphic vector bundle, being $g_{\\alpha,\\beta}$ holomorphic. 2) I want to prove that this corresponds to the idea of fiber bundle given in class: I want to prove that $F_p \\cong (E_p)^*$. For this purpose I would like to define a duality between $F_p$ and $E_p$, i.e. $E_p \\times F_p \\to \\mathbb{C}$. Let $\\{(U_{\\alpha},\\psi_{\\alpha})\\}$ be a trivializzation of $E$, and let $\\{(U_{\\alpha},\\psi^*_{\\alpha})\\}$ be a trivializzation of $F$. If $p \\in U_{\\alpha}$, then\n$$E_p \\times F_p \\to \\mathbb{C}$$\n$$((p,v), (p,w)) \\mapsto \\langle \\pi_2\\psi_{\\alpha}((p,v)),\\pi_2\\psi^*_{\\alpha}((p,w)) \\rangle$$ Here $\\pi_2$ is the projection $\\pi_2 \\colon U_{\\alpha} \\times \\mathbb{C}^k \\to C^{k}$, and $\\langle \\cdot,\\cdot \\rangle$ is the standard Hermitian product on $\\mathbb{C}^k$. I would like also to prove this application is well defined, i.e., if $p \\in U_{\\alpha} \\cap U_{\\beta}$ I would like this to be independent of $\\alpha$. Here is where I am supposed to show that the choise of the transition functions for $F$ is what makes things work. (At the moment, I am stuck with this, help please!!!) The application $v \\to \\langle \\pi_2\\psi_{\\alpha}((p,v)),\\pi_2\\psi^*_{\\alpha}((p,w)) \\rangle$ seems to be a linear application from $E_p \\to \\mathbb{C}$ and this should give the result I was looking for. Am I correct?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "comes a time in every man's life when the only thing left is its partial solution to the problem. I am sorry but I am not going to invest more reputation for this question.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure the problem as per the required format. The original question is about proving that the dual vector bundle of a holomorphic vector bundle is also holomorphic. The user mentions transition functions and their duals, so the key assumptions here are related to the properties of the original bundle and the transition functions.\n\nFirst, the problem states that $(E, \\pi, M)$ is a holomorphic bundle. So the first assumption is about E being a holomorphic vector bundle. Then, the complex manifold structure of M with the complex structure J is another assumption. The transition functions being holomorphic is crucial here because that's part of the definition of a holomorphic vector bundle. \n\nWhen taking the dual bundle, the transition functions are the dual (inverse transpose) of the original ones. Since the original transition functions are holomorphic, their duals should also be holomorphic. That's another assumption—that taking the dual (or inverse transpose) of a holomorphic function remains holomorphic. But wait, the user is trying to prove that the dual bundle is holomorphic, so maybe the assumption is that the original transition functions are holomorphic, and the problem is to show that the dual's transition functions (which are the duals of the originals) are also holomorphic, thereby making the dual bundle holomorphic.\n\nThe problem statement in the original question is to prove that the dual vector bundle E* → M is holomorphic. The user's approach is using transition functions, which is the right path. So the assumptions should list each property needed. Let me parse the original problem again.\n\nOriginal assumptions from the problem: E is a holomorphic bundle, meaning (M, J) is a complex manifold, π: E → M is a complex bundle with holomorphic transition functions. The task is to show E* is holomorphic. So the key points are:\n\n- M is a complex manifold.\n- E is a complex bundle over M.\n- E has holomorphic transition functions.\n- The dual bundle E* is constructed with transition functions that are the dual (inverse transpose) of E's transition functions.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are each of these points, but broken down into single properties. So:\n\nAssumption 1: (M, J) is a complex manifold.\n\nAssumption 2: π: E → M is a complex vector bundle.\n\nAssumption 3: E has a trivialization with holomorphic transition functions.\n\nProblem: Prove that the dual vector bundle E* → M is holomorphic.\n\nWait, but in the example given, the assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem, the user didn't mention n needing to be divisible by 7. Wait, maybe that example was specific. In this case, the original problem states that E is a holomorphic bundle, which implies all those conditions. So the assumptions here are the conditions given in the problem statement. So the user is told that E is a holomorphic bundle, which already includes M being a complex manifold, E being a complex bundle, and transition functions being holomorphic.\n\nTherefore, structuring the problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. (M, J) is a complex manifold.\n\n2. π: E → M is a complex vector bundle.\n\n3. E has holomorphic transition functions {g_{αβ}}.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that the dual bundle E* is holomorphic.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is presented as given E is a holomorphic bundle (so all the above are already given), so the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption: E is a holomorphic vector bundle.\n\nBut breaking down into single conditions:\n\nAssumption: (M, J) is a complex manifold.\n\nAssumption: π: E → M is a complex vector bundle.\n\nAssumption: E has a trivialization with holomorphic transition functions.\n\nProblem: Prove that the dual vector bundle E* → M is also holomorphic.\n\nBut maybe even more precisely, the dual bundle's transition functions are the dual (inverse transpose) of the original ones. So another assumption could be that the dual bundle is defined with transition functions (g_{αβ}^*)^{-1} or similar. However, the problem is to show that E* is holomorphic, given that E is. So the key is that the dual transition functions are holomorphic, given that the original ones are.\n\nSo, in the assumptions, each condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption: (M, J) is a complex manifold.\n\nAssumption: E is a complex vector bundle over M.\n\nAssumption: The transition functions g_{αβ} of E are holomorphic.\n\nProblem: Prove that the dual vector bundle E* is a holomorphic vector bundle.\n\nThat seems to fit the required format. Each assumption is a single property applied to one object. The first is about M, the second about E, the third about the transition functions of E. Then the problem is to prove E* is holomorphic.",
