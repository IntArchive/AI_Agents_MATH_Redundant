    "Content": "Let $E/K$ be an elliptic curve over a field $K$, with discriminant $\\Delta$. Then the polynomial $x^3-\\Delta$ has a root (and hence all roots since Galois) in $K(E[3])$; this can be shown laboriously through solving the 3-division polynomial (a quartic). Is there a nicer/more intuitive way of seeing this and can you please provide a proper reference for either the above method or whatever you suggest?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "One way to think about this is via the modular curves parametrizing\nelliptic curves $E$ with either $E[3]$ or $\\Delta^{1/3}$ rational.\nNote that $\\Delta^{1/3}$ is rational iff $j^{1/3}$ is rational,\nbecause $j = E_4^3 / \\Delta$. Assume for simplicity that $K$ contains the cube roots of unity\n(because $K(E[3])$ contains them in any case thanks to the Weil pairing).\nThe $E[3]$ curve is the modular curve $X(3)$, with a map $X(3) \\to X(1)$\nthat forgets the $3$-torsion structure, and is Galois with group\n${\\rm PSL}_2({\\bf Z}/3{\\bf Z}) \\cong A_4$. Now $A_4$ has a normal subgroup, the \n \" Klein $4$-group \" \n$V_4$ consisting of the identity and the three double transpositions.\n(The $V$ stands for German \"Vierergruppe\".)\nSo $X(3) / V_4$ is a Galois cover, call it $X'(3)$, of $X(1)$ with group\n$A_4 / V_4 \\cong {\\bf Z} / 3 {\\bf Z}$, i.e. a 3:1 cyclic cover.\nOnce $K$ contains cube roots of unity, Kummer theory says that\nany 3:1 cyclic cover is obtained by adjoining a cube root\nto the function field; here this function field is $K(j)$,\nso the function field $K(X'(3))$ is $K(j,F^{1/3})$\nwhere $F$ is some rational function of $j$ that's not already a cube. The punchline is that we can take $F=j$.  Since the function field of\n$X'(3)$ is contained in the function field of $X(3)$, this explains\nwhy $\\Delta^{1/3}$ is a rational function of the coordinates of $E[3]$. The fact that $K(X'(3)) = K(j^{1/3})$ can almost be recovered from\nthe ramification structure of the map $X(3) \\to X(1)$.  It is ramified\nonly above $j=\\infty$, $j=0$, and $j=1728$, with cycle structures\n$(3,1)$, $(3,1)$, $(2,2)$ respectively.  Hence the cover $X'(3) \\to X(1)$\nis ramified only above $j=0$ and $j=\\infty$, so $K(X'(3))$ must be\n$K((cj)^{1/3})$ for some constant $c \\in K^*$.\nThe fact that we can use $c=1$ takes a bit more work,\nbut once we know that the cover has this form it's enough\nto just try some convenient $E$ with $j(E)\\neq 0$ to complete the proof.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this Math Stack Exchange question. The user is asking about the cube root of the discriminant of an elliptic curve. The problem states that for an elliptic curve E over a field K, with discriminant Δ, the polynomial x³ - Δ has a root in K(E[3]), which is the field obtained by adjoining the coordinates of the 3-torsion points of E. They mention that one method involves using the 3-division polynomial, which is quartic, but they find this laborious and are looking for a more intuitive approach or a proper reference.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement following the given format. The assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. The original example had assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, the key elements are the elliptic curve E over a field K, the discriminant Δ, and the field extension K(E[3]). \n\nAssumptions:\n- E/K is an elliptic curve over a field K.\n- Δ is the discriminant of E.\n- The polynomial x³ - Δ is considered.\n- K(E[3]) is the field extension of K generated by the coordinates of the 3-torsion points of E.\n\nProblem:\nProve that x³ - Δ has a root in K(E[3]).\n\nWait, but the original question mentions that the polynomial x³ - Δ has a root in K(E[3]), and all roots are there since it's Galois. So the problem is to show that this polynomial splits completely over K(E[3]), or at least that there's a root there. The user is asking for an intuitive explanation or reference for this fact, instead of going through the 3-division polynomial method.\n\nSo structuring the problem as per the format, the assumptions need to be each a single condition on one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nE is an elliptic curve over a field K,\nΔ is the discriminant of E,\nThe field extension K(E[3]) is the field generated over K by the coordinates of the 3-torsion points of E.\n\nProblem: Prove that the polynomial x³ - Δ has a root in K(E[3]).\n\nBut wait, the original problem also mentions that since it's Galois, all roots are there once one is. So maybe the problem statement is that the polynomial splits completely in K(E[3]). However, the user wrote \"has a root (and hence all roots since Galois) in K(E[3])\". So the main point is to show that there exists a cube root of Δ in K(E[3]).\n\nBut the assumptions need to be only the given conditions. The fact that K(E[3]) is Galois over K might not be an assumption but part of the reasoning. Hmm. Wait, the user says \"since Galois\", but is that an assumption or a conclusion? The field K(E[3]) is a Galois extension if K is perfect, but maybe in general, the extension might not be Galois unless certain conditions on K. However, the problem states \"has a root (and hence all roots since Galois) in K(E[3])\". So perhaps the user is assuming that K(E[3]) is Galois over K? Or perhaps that once you adjoin one root, the others are also there because the extension is Galois.\n\nWait, but maybe the polynomial x³ - Δ splits in K(E[3]) because the field is Galois. But the key is to show that at least one root is in K(E[3]). Then, if the extension is Galois, the polynomial would split. However, the user is saying that once there's one root, all roots are there because the extension is Galois. So maybe the main task is to show that there exists a cube root of Δ in K(E[3]).\n\nTherefore, the problem is to prove that x³ - Δ has a root in K(E[3]). The assumptions are that E is an elliptic curve over K, Δ is its discriminant, and K(E[3]) is the field generated by the 3-torsion points.\n\nBut wait, the discriminant Δ is an element of K, right? Because E is defined over K, so its discriminant is in K. So Δ ∈ K. Then x³ - Δ is a polynomial over K, and the question is why does it have a root in K(E[3]).\n\nSo the structured problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nE is an elliptic curve defined over a field K,\nΔ is the discriminant of E,\nK(E[3]) is the field extension of K generated by the coordinates of the 3-torsion points of E.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the polynomial x³ - Δ has a root in K(E[3]).\n\nI think that's accurate. The assumptions are the given conditions, each stated separately. The problem is to show the existence of a cube root of Δ in that field. The user's question is about a more intuitive method than using the 3-division polynomial, and a reference. But according to the format, we just need to structure the problem, not answer it. So the answer should be the formatted problem with assumptions and problem statement.",
