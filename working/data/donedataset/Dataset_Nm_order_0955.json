    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $$f(x) = 2(\\cos \\frac{4\\pi x}{19} + \\cos \\frac{6\\pi x}{19} + \\cos \\frac{10\\pi x}{19})$$ Then we claim that the following are true: $$f(1) + f(4)^2 = 4$$ $$f(4) + f(16)^2 = 4$$ $$f(16) + f(64)^2 = 4$$ Noting that $\\displaystyle f(4) \\lt 0$, $\\displaystyle f(16) \\lt 0$ and $\\displaystyle f(64) = f(1) \\gt 0$, we can show the identity about $\\displaystyle f(1)$. In order to prove the above three identities, We use the fact that if $\\displaystyle P(z) = z^4 + z^{-4} + z^6 + z^{-6} + z^{10} + z^{-10}$ and if $\\displaystyle w$ is a root of $\\displaystyle z^{19} = -1$ then $$P(w) + P^2(w^4) = 4$$ After some (slightly tedious, but easy) algebraic manipulation, the above identity involving $\\displaystyle P(w)$ basically boils down to proving that $$w^{18} - w^{17} + w^{16} - w^{15} + \\dots + w^{2} - w = -1$$ which follows easily from the fact that $$ 0 = w^{19} + 1 = (w+1)(w^{18} - w^{17} + w^{16} - w^{15} + \\dots + w^{2} - w + 1)$$ Now since $\\displaystyle P(z) = P(-z)$, the identity is also true of $\\displaystyle w$ is a root of $\\displaystyle z^{19} = 1$ Thus applying the identity with $\\displaystyle P(w)$ three times to $\\displaystyle c, c^4, c^{16}$, where $\\displaystyle c = \\cos \\frac{\\pi}{19} + i \\sin \\frac{\\pi}{19}$ we get the above three identities involving $\\displaystyle f(1), f(4), f(16)$ and thus we are done.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about showing that a specific trigonometric expression is a root of a particular equation involving nested square roots. \n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions. The problem mentions the number 2 multiplied by the sum of three cosines with angles that are multiples of π/19. The equation given is a nested square root equation set equal to x. \n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. In the example, the first assumption was that n is an integer, and the second that n is divisible by 7. However, in the original problem here, there aren't explicit conditions like divisibility. The main objects here are the trigonometric expression and the equation. \n\nWait, but perhaps the assumptions here are about the properties of the objects involved. For instance, the problem states that the number is a root of the equation. So, one assumption could be that the number is defined as the sum of those cosines multiplied by 2. Another assumption is that the equation involves nested square roots. But I need to be careful not to include the problem itself in the assumptions.\n\nThe assumptions should list any given conditions or definitions. The problem here is to prove that this specific number (defined by the cosine terms) is a root of the equation. So the assumptions would include the definition of the number and the equation it needs to satisfy. But according to the example, assumptions are more about conditions on variables or objects. In the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, perhaps the main assumption is the definition of the number as 2 times the sum of those cosines, and the equation being the nested square roots equals x. But the problem is to show that this number is a root of that equation.\n\nWait, the example had the problem as proving A(n) is divisible by 91, with assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is to show that a certain expression is a root of an equation. The assumptions would be the definitions of the expression and the equation. However, in the example, the assumptions were conditions on n, not definitions. So maybe here, the assumption is that the expression 2(...) is a number, and the equation is given as sqrt(4 + sqrt(4 + sqrt(4 - x))) = x. But perhaps the key is to list any implicit conditions. For example, maybe the problem assumes that x is real, or that the expression evaluates to a real number. But the original problem doesn't state that explicitly. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem doesn't have additional assumptions beyond what's given. The example included assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7, which were part of the problem statement. In the current problem, the user is asking to show that the given expression is a root of the equation. The problem statement itself defines the expression and the equation. So maybe the assumptions here are just the definitions of the terms involved. But according to the example, assumptions are conditions applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption: Let x be a real number.\nAssumption: Define the expression 2(cos(4π/19) + cos(6π/19) + cos(10π/19)).\nProblem: Show that this expression is a root of the equation sqrt(4 + sqrt(4 + sqrt(4 - x))) = x.\n\nBut the original problem doesn't mention x being real, though it's implied. The example didn't have such an assumption, but included the conditions on n. Maybe the key is to extract any conditions or definitions that are given. In the original problem, the expression is defined, and the equation is given. So perhaps the only assumption is the definition of the expression and the equation. However, the example structured assumptions as conditions on variables. Here, since the problem is to show that a specific number satisfies the equation, perhaps there are no additional assumptions beyond the problem statement. But the example included even the variable being an integer as an assumption. \n\nWait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, so the assumption was that n is an integer, and the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. But the user's formatted example included an additional assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, looking back: the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) [...] is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem's assumptions were \"$n$ is an integer, $n$ is divisible by $7$.\" Wait, that seems incorrect because the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7. That might be a mistake in the example. Wait, perhaps the user made an error in their example? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem includes \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That would actually be incorrect. Maybe the example was a bad one, but I have to follow the user's format regardless.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended the example to have assumptions that are necessary for the problem, even if they're not explicitly stated. For instance, in the example, perhaps the problem requires n to be divisible by 7, but the original problem states \"for every integer n,\" which would make the assumption incorrect. So perhaps the example is flawed, but I have to proceed as per instructions.\n\nIn the current problem, the problem is to show that the given trigonometric expression is a root of the equation. The equation is given, and the expression is given. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The number in question is defined as 2 times the sum of those three cosines.\n- The equation is sqrt(4 + sqrt(4 + sqrt(4 - x))) = x.\n\nBut according to the example's structure, assumptions are conditions applied to one object each. So maybe:\n\nAssumption: Let x be a real number such that sqrt(4 + sqrt(4 + sqrt(4 - x))) = x.\nAssumption: Define the number as 2(cos(4π/19) + cos(6π/19) + cos(10π/19)).\n\nBut the problem is to show that this number satisfies the equation. So perhaps the problem statement is to prove that the given number is a root of the equation. Therefore, the assumptions would be the definitions necessary. However, the example had assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n,\" which might be conflicting. So maybe the user wants to list the problem's given conditions as assumptions, even if they are part of the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions are the properties that the problem assumes the reader knows, but that's not clear. The user wants to filter unrelated information and structure the problem with assumptions and the problem. The example seems to have taken the original problem's conditions (for every integer n) and possibly added a condition (n divisible by 7) which might be a mistake. But in the current problem, the original question doesn't have any such conditions except defining the number and the equation. Therefore, maybe the assumptions here are just the definition of the number and the equation. However, since the example included two assumptions, perhaps we need to split them into separate lines.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption: Define the number as 2 multiplied by the sum of cos(4π/19), cos(6π/19), and cos(10π/19).\nAssumption: The equation is sqrt(4 + sqrt(4 + sqrt(4 - x))) = x.\nProblem: Show that the defined number is a root of the equation.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions are conditions on variables or objects. Here, the first assumption defines the number, and the second defines the equation. However, in the example, the assumptions were about the variable n. So perhaps in this case, the assumptions should be about x. But the problem is to show that a particular number is a root, so x is the variable in the equation, and the number is a specific value of x. Therefore, maybe:\n\nAssumption: Let x be a real number.\nAssumption: The equation is sqrt(4 + sqrt(4 + sqrt(4 - x))) = x.\nProblem: Prove that x = 2(cos(4π/19) + cos(6π/19) + cos(10π/19)) satisfies the equation.\n\nBut the problem is phrased as showing that the number is a root, so maybe:\n\nAssumption: The equation sqrt(4 + sqrt(4 + sqrt(4 - x))) = x is given.\nAssumption: The number is defined as 2(cos(4π/19) + cos(6π/19) + cos(10π/19)).\nProblem: Show that the number is a root of the equation.\n\nBut each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. So splitting into two assumptions: one defining the equation, and the other defining the number. Then the problem is to show the number satisfies the equation.\n\nYes, that seems to fit the example's structure, where the assumptions were about n being an integer and n divisible by 7, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n.\" So in this case, even though the problem is to show that a specific number is a root, the assumptions are the definitions of the number and the equation. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: Define the number as 2 multiplied by the sum of cos(4π/19), cos(6π/19), and cos(10π/19).\nAssumption: The equation is sqrt(4 + sqrt(4 + sqrt(4 - x))) = x.\nProblem: Show that the defined number is a root of the equation.\n\nBut I need to check the LaTeX formatting. The original problem has the equation as sqrt{4 + sqrt{4 + sqrt{4 - x}}} = x. So in LaTeX, it's \\sqrt{ 4+ \\sqrt{ 4 + \\sqrt{ 4-x}}}=x. Also, the number is 2( cos (4π/19) + cos (6π/19) + cos (10π/19) ).\n\nSo the final answer should have the assumptions listed as two separate points, each addressing one definition, and the problem statement.",
