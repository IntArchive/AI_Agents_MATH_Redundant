    "Content": "Let $G$ be the additive group of the sequences $(a_n)_{n\\ge 1} \\subset \\mathbb{Z}$ and let $f:G \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ be a group homomorphism. We denote by $e_i$ the sequence $(0,0,...,0,1,0,0...)$ (we just have a $1$ on the $i$ -th position, everything else is zero). Show that the set $\\{i\\ge 1 | f(e_i) \\ne 0\\}$ is finite. I thought that I should consider the set of sequences of finite support i.e. the subgroup generated by the $e_i$ s. Let's denote it by $H$ . We have that $f(H)$ is a subgroup of $\\mathbb{Z}$ , so $f(H)=m\\mathbb{Z}$ for some integer $m$ . We also have that $f(G)=n\\mathbb{Z}$ for some positive integer $n$ . But I don't know how to proceed any further. I think that we should aim for a contradiction. I can only think about something having to do with divisibility, but I don't know.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This is a proof which is completely elementary (although not too simple). The idea is to prove that, for $n$ sufficiently big, $f(e_{n})=0$ . Consider a sequence of the kind $x=(2^{n_{1}},2^{n_{2}},...)$ , where $(n_{i})$ is an increasing sequence of natural numbers (I'll explain later how I'm going to choose that sequence). For every $k$ , we have $$\nf(x)=f(2^{n_{1}},...,2^{n_{k}},2^{n_{k+1}},...)=\\sum_{i=1}^{k}2^{n_{i}}f(e_{i})+f(0,...,0,2^{n_{k+1}},2^{n_{k+2}},...)=\\sum_{i=1}^{k}2^{n_{i}}f(e_{i})+2^{n_{k+1}}f(0,...,0,1,2^{n_{k+2}-n_{k+1}},2^{n_{k+3}-n_{k+1}},...).\n$$ Call $b_{k}=f(0,...,0,1,2^{n_{k+2}-n_{k+1}},2^{n_{k+3}-n_{k+1}},...)$ , so that $$f(x)=\\sum_{i=1}^{k}2^{n_{i}}f(e_{i})+2^{n_{k+1}}b_{k}.$$ Therefore, $$b_{k}=\\dfrac{1}{2^{n_{k+1}}}\\left[f(x)-\\sum_{i=1}^{k}2^{n_{i}}f(e_{i})\\right].$$ Now, applying the Triangle Inequality, $$|b_{k}|\\leq \\dfrac{1}{2^{n_{k+1}}}\\left[|f(x)|+\\sum_{i=1}^{k}2^{n_{i}}|f(e_{i})|\\right].$$ By choosing $(n_{i})$ appropriately, we can make the right hand side of the above inequality tend to $1/2$ . Simply choose by recursion the sequence so that for every $k$ , $$\\sum_{i=1}^{k}2^{n_{i}}|f(e_{i})|<\\dfrac{1}{2}2^{n_{k+1}},$$ and we have convergence to $1/2$ . Since $b_{k}$ is an integer for every $k$ , we have $b_{k}=0$ for $k\\geq N$ ( $N$ being a sufficiently large natural number). Now, simply notice that $b_{k}=f(e_{k+1})+2^{n_{k+2}-n_{k+1}}b_{k+1}$ (this follows directly from the definition of $b_{k}$ ). Using this, we deduce immediately that $f(e_{k})=0$ for large $k$ . Hope this helps!",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions and then state the problem clearly.\n\nThe original question is about showing that the set {i ≥ 1 | f(e_i) ≠ 0} is finite, given that G is the additive group of sequences of integers and f is a group homomorphism from G to Z. \n\nLet me list the assumptions one by one. The key objects here are G, f, e_i, and the conditions on them. \n\nAssumptions:\n1. G is the additive group of sequences (a_n)_{n≥1} subset of Z. So each element of G is an integer sequence starting from n=1.\n2. f: G → Z is a group homomorphism. This means f preserves the group operation, so f(a + b) = f(a) + f(b) for all a, b in G.\n3. e_i is the sequence with 1 in the i-th position and 0 elsewhere. These are the standard basis sequences.\n4. The problem asks about the set {i ≥ 1 | f(e_i) ≠ 0}, which needs to be shown as finite.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is a single property applied to one object. Let me check:\n\n1. Correct, defines G.\n2. Correct, defines f's property.\n3. Correct, defines e_i.\n4. Wait, the problem statement is the actual question, so maybe the set {i ≥ 1 | f(e_i) ≠ 0} being finite is the conclusion to prove, not an assumption. So maybe the user's example had an assumption where the original problem included a condition (like n divisible by 7), but here, the problem is to show that set is finite given the prior assumptions. So the assumptions are the first three points, and the problem is to show the set is finite.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should be the three points above, and the problem is to show the finiteness of that set.\n\nWait, but the original question's problem statement says: \"Show that the set {i ≥ 1 | f(e_i) ≠ 0} is finite.\" So the problem is exactly that. The user also mentions their own thoughts, but those are part of the question's context, not the problem's assumptions. So the actual problem is:\n\nProblem: Show that the set {i ≥ 1 | f(e_i) ≠ 0} is finite.\n\nAssumptions:\n1. G is the additive group of sequences (a_n)_{n≥1} in ℤ.\n2. f: G → ℤ is a group homomorphism.\n3. e_i denotes the sequence with 1 in the i-th position and 0 elsewhere.\n\nEach of these is a single condition on a single object. The third assumption defines e_i. The first defines G, the second defines f's properties. The problem is to show the finiteness of the specified set.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption: \nG is the additive group of sequences $(a_n)_{n \\ge 1} \\subset \\mathbb{Z}$,\n$f: G \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ is a group homomorphism,\n$e_i$ is the sequence with 1 at the i-th position and 0 elsewhere.\nProblem: Show that the set $\\{i \\ge 1 \\mid f(e_i) \\ne 0\\}$ is finite.\n\nI need to check if each assumption is one line, one property. The first defines G, the second defines f, the third defines e_i. Yes. The problem is as stated. The user's example had some incorrect assumptions, like in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe the example was a case where the user had to correct the original problem? Wait, looking back at the example:\n\nOriginal problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, the example might have been a mistake, but perhaps the user intended to show that sometimes assumptions are not explicitly stated. Wait, but in the problem given here, all assumptions are given in the problem statement. So I should just list them as per the problem.\n\nIn the current case, the problem is as stated, so no hidden assumptions. Therefore, the formatted problem is as above.",
