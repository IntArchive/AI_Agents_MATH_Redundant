    "Content": "This is something I'm having a hard time finding online, but say we know that $f(x) > g(x)$ (for all inputs $x > a_{0}$ for some $a_{0}$ ), then would it always be true that $f^{-1}(x) < g^{-1}(x)$ (for all inputs $x > b_{0}$ for some $b_{0}$ )? For example, let $f(x) = 2^{x}$ and $g(x) = x^{2}$ . $f^{-1}(x) = \\log_{2}(x)$ and $g^{-1}(x) = \\sqrt{(x)}$ If I plot on desmos I see $\\sqrt{(x)}$ eventually exceeds $\\log_{2}(x)$ , so hence we can say $f^{-1}(x) < g^{-1}(x)$ for this example Since this is just the definition of Big-O, could we say $f = O(g) => f^{-1} = \\Omega(g^{-1})$ Not sure how to prove it but isn't it intuitive from the fact that the inverse is just reflecting over $y = x$ , so if $g$ is above $f$ , then after reflecting $g^{-1}$ is below $f^{-1}$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let us look at a few simple examples to start out. $f(x) = x$ and $g(x) = x-1$ . We then have $f(x)>g(x)$ . We can now compute the inverses. $f^{-1}(x) =x$ and $g^{-1}(x) = x+1$ so we have $f^{-1}(x)<g^{-1}(x)$ . Now for a second example: $f(x) = -x$ and $g(x) = -x-1$ . We have that $f(x) > g(x)$ . we will now find the inverses $f^{-1}(x) = -x$ and $g^{-1}(x) = -x - 1$ . In this case we have that $f^{-1}(x)>g^{-1}(x)$ . So we can see that we cannot say for sure anything about the inverses if we know nothing about the function. This may be too advanced, depending on your level of education, but I will say, if we expect an inverse of a continuous function to exist, then a function should be monotone otherwise an inverse would not be well defined. They should also have the same domain and range, otherwise $f(x)$ might not be defined for some $g(x)$ . If these conditions are met then we can go further with your question. I claim that if $f$ and $g$ are both monotone increasing and $f(x) > g(x)$ , then we have $f^{-1}(x) < g^{-1}(x)$ . Additionally, if $f$ and $g$ are both monotone decreasing and $f(x) > g(x)$ , then we have $f^{-1}(x) > g^{-1}(x)$ . I will prove the former claim and leave the latter to you. Let us start by assuming $f$ and $g$ are continuous, monotone increasing, and have the same domain and range. $f^{-1}$ and $g^{-1}$ are also monotone increasing. We then start with $x=x$ . We then get: $$ f(f^{-1}(x)) = g(g^{-1}(x)) $$ Then because $g(y) < f(y)$ , in this case $y = g^{-1}(x)$ . $$ f(f^{-1}(x)) < f(g^{-1}(x)) $$ Then because $f^{-1}$ is monotone increasing: $$ f^{-1}(f(f^{-1}(x))) < f^{-1}(f(g^{-1}(x))) $$ We can then use $f^{-1}(f(y)) = y$ . $$ f^{-1}(x) < g^{-1}(x) $$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's break down the problem the user is asking. They want to know if taking the inverse of both sides of an inequality flips the inequality, similar to how multiplying by a negative number would. The example given uses exponential and quadratic functions, showing that after a certain point, the inverse of the quadratic (square root) overtakes the inverse of the exponential (logarithm). \n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question correctly. The user mentions functions f and g where f(x) > g(x) for all x > a₀. They then ask if the inverses would satisfy f⁻¹(x) < g⁻¹(x) for all x > b₀, some b₀. They also relate this to Big O notation, suggesting f = O(g) implies f⁻¹ = Ω(g⁻¹). \n\nThe example given is f(x) = 2^x and g(x) = x². Their inverses are log₂x and sqrt(x), respectively. The user observes that sqrt(x) eventually exceeds log₂x, which supports the idea that the inverse of the smaller function (g) becomes larger than the inverse of the original larger function (f). \n\nNow, to structure this into the required format. The assumptions need to be listed line by line, each addressing one property. The problem statement should be concise.\n\nAssumptions:\n1. f and g are functions such that inverses f⁻¹ and g⁻¹ exist for all x > b₀ for some b₀.\n2. f(x) > g(x) for all x > a₀, where a₀ is some constant.\n3. The inverses f⁻¹ and g⁻¹ are considered for inputs x > b₀ for some b₀.\n\nProblem:\nDetermine if f⁻¹(x) < g⁻¹(x) for all x > b₀.\n\nBut wait, the original question is phrased as a \"would it always be true\" so the problem is to prove or determine the validity of the statement. Also, the mention of Big O is part of the user's reasoning but perhaps not part of the core problem. The example is illustrative, but the main question is the general case.\n\nWait, the user's title is about taking the inverse of both sides of an inequality, so the key points are the functions being inverses and the inequality flipping. The assumptions should include that f and g are invertible for x > a₀, and that f(x) > g(x) in that domain. The problem is to see if the inverses then satisfy the reversed inequality.\n\nBut in the example, the inverses are log and sqrt. For x sufficiently large, 2^x > x², but log₂x < sqrt(x) for x sufficiently large. So the inverse of the larger function becomes smaller. So the user's intuition is that inverses reverse the inequality, similar to reflecting over y=x. \n\nSo the key assumptions are that f and g are invertible beyond some a₀, and f(x) > g(x) there. The problem is to prove whether f⁻¹(x) < g⁻¹(x) beyond some b₀. The user also mentions Big O, but perhaps that's a side note. The core problem is the inequality of inverses.\n\nSo structuring:\n\nAssumption:\n- f and g are invertible for all x > a₀ for some a₀.\n- f(x) > g(x) for all x > a₀.\n\nProblem:\nProve or determine whether f⁻¹(x) < g⁻¹(x) for all x > b₀ for some b₀.\n\nBut need to make sure each assumption is one line per object. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n- f is a function invertible for all x > a₀, for some a₀.\n- g is a function invertible for all x > a₀, for some a₀.\n- For all x > a₀, f(x) > g(x).\n\nProblem:\nIs it true that f⁻¹(x) < g⁻¹(x) for all x > b₀ for some b₀?\n\nWait, but the original question says \"for some a₀\" and \"for some b₀\". So each invertibility and the inequality condition are separate. Also, the functions f and g each have their own invertibility, but the user might be assuming they're both invertible beyond the same a₀. Alternatively, they could have different a₀s but perhaps after taking the maximum. But the problem as posed says \"for all inputs x > a₀ for some a₀\".\n\nSo perhaps the assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\n- There exists a real number a₀ such that for all x > a₀, f(x) and g(x) are invertible.\n- For all x > a₀, f(x) > g(x).\n\nProblem:\nDoes there exist a real number b₀ such that for all x > b₀, f⁻¹(x) < g⁻¹(x)?\n\nBut maybe split the invertibility into two assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\n- There exists a real number a₀ such that f(x) is invertible for all x > a₀.\n- There exists a real number a₀ such that g(x) is invertible for all x > a₀.\n- For all x > a₀, f(x) > g(x).\n\nBut the user might have intended the same a₀ for both. Hmm. The original problem states \"for all inputs x > a₀ for some a₀\", so perhaps it's a single a₀ where both are invertible and the inequality holds. So combining:\n\nAssumption:\n- There exists a real number a₀ such that f(x) and g(x) are both invertible for all x > a₀.\n- For all x > a₀, f(x) > g(x).\n\nProblem:\nDoes there exist a real number b₀ such that for all x > b₀, f⁻¹(x) < g⁻¹(x)?\n\nBut the user also mentions \"for some b₀\", so the problem is to determine if such a b₀ exists. The question is phrased as \"would it always be true that...\", so the problem is to prove or disprove the statement.\n\nAnother point: the functions' inverses may have different domains. For example, if f(x) = 2^x, its inverse log₂x is defined for x > 0, but if we consider f(x) for x > a₀, then the inverse would be defined for x > f(a₀). Similarly for g(x). So the inverses are defined on the ranges of f and g beyond a₀. Therefore, the domain for the inverses would be x > b₀ where b₀ is max{f(a₀), g(a₀)}. But maybe the user is assuming that the inverses are defined for x > b₀, which is part of the problem's conditions.\n\nIn any case, to structure the problem as per the example, the assumptions should list each condition. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- f is invertible for all x > a₀.\n- g is invertible for all x > a₀.\n- For all x > a₀, f(x) > g(x).\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that there exists a real number b₀ such that for all x > b₀, f⁻¹(x) < g⁻¹(x).\n\nAlternatively, since the original question is phrased as a question, the problem statement could be \"Is it true that f⁻¹(x) < g⁻¹(x) for all x > b₀ for some b₀?\" But following the example given, which converted the original problem into a \"Prove that...\" statement, perhaps the problem here is to determine whether the statement is true, hence \"Prove or disprove...\".\n\nBut the example given by the user had a mistake in the original problem where the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\", but the original problem didn't state that. Wait, the user's example was:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like an error, because the original problem didn't have that assumption. Maybe the user made a mistake in their example. But since we are supposed to follow their format, we need to extract assumptions from the problem statement.\n\nWait, perhaps in their example, the original problem was edited to add the assumption. Wait, no. The original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n)... is divisible by 91.\" But 91 is 7*13. The formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is an integer\" (which is given in the original problem) and \"n is divisible by 7\" which is not in the original problem. This seems like a mistake in the example. Therefore, perhaps the user intended that the assumptions include both the given conditions and possibly other implicit ones. But since we are to follow the format, even if the example is flawed, we need to structure the current problem accordingly.\n\nGiven that, for the current problem, the user's original question is:\n\nTitle: Taking the inverse (not the reciprocal) of both sides of an inequality\n\nQuestion: This is something I'm having a hard time finding online, but say we know that $f(x) > g(x)$ (for all inputs $x > a_{0}$ for some $a_{0}$ ), then would it always be true that $f^{-1}(x) < g^{-1}(x)$ (for all inputs $x > b_{0}$ for some $b_{0}$ )? For example, let $f(x) = 2^{x}$ and $g(x) = x^{2}$ . $f^{-1}(x) = \\log_{2}(x)$ and $g^{-1}(x) = \\sqrt{(x)}$ If I plot on desmos I see $\\sqrt{(x)}$ eventually exceeds $\\log_{2}(x)$ , so hence we can say $f^{-1}(x) < g^{-1}(x)$ for this example Since this is just the definition of Big-O, could we say $f = O(g) => f^{-1} = \\Omega(g^{-1})$ Not sure how to prove it but isn't it intuitive from the fact that the inverse is just reflecting over $y = x$ , so if $g$ is above $f$ , then after reflecting $g^{-1}$ is below $f^{-1}$.\n\nSo the assumptions here are:\n\n- f and g are functions such that for all x > a₀, f(x) > g(x).\n\n- f and g are invertible for x > a₀.\n\nThe problem is: Does it follow that for some b₀, f⁻¹(x) < g⁻¹(x) for all x > b₀?\n\nBut the user also mentions the example with 2^x and x², which are both invertible for x sufficiently large (though x² is not invertible over all reals, but for x > 0, it's invertible if we take the positive branch). However, in their example, for x large enough, 2^x > x², and the inverses are log and sqrt. They observe that sqrt(x) overtakes log₂x eventually.\n\nSo, the key assumptions are:\n\n1. There exists a real number a₀ such that for all x > a₀, f(x) > g(x).\n\n2. Both f and g are invertible for all x > a₀.\n\nThe problem is whether there exists a real number b₀ such that for all x > b₀, f⁻¹(x) < g⁻¹(x).\n\nAdditionally, the user relates this to Big O, suggesting that if f is O(g), then f⁻¹ is Ω(g⁻¹). But that's a separate point, and the main question is about the inequality of inverses.\n\nTherefore, structuring this:\n\nAssumption:\n- There exists a real number a₀ such that f and g are invertible for all x > a₀.\n- For all x > a₀, f(x) > g(x).\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that there exists a real number b₀ such that for all x > b₀, f⁻¹(x) < g⁻¹(x).\n\nAlternatively, since invertibility might need to be separate for f and g:\n\nAssumption:\n- f is invertible for all x > a₀.\n- g is invertible for all x > a₀.\n- For all x > a₀, f(x) > g(x).\n\nProblem:\nDoes there exist a real number b₀ such that for all x > b₀, f⁻¹(x) < g⁻¹(x)?\n\nBut the user's example combines both functions being invertible beyond a₀. Also, the problem is whether the inverse inequality holds beyond some b₀. \n\nAnother point to consider: when you reflect over y=x, the inequality f(x) > g(x) would translate to f⁻¹(y) < g⁻¹(y) for y > b₀ where b₀ is the minimum value such that y > f(a₀) and y > g(a₀). But this requires that both functions are increasing, otherwise the inverses might not be functions or the inequality might not hold. For example, if f and g are decreasing, the inequality might reverse differently. So perhaps the user implicitly assumes that f and g are increasing functions for x > a₀, which is necessary for them to have inverses.\n\nWait, invertible functions must be bijections. For functions defined on intervals, they need to be strictly increasing or decreasing. So if f and g are strictly increasing for x > a₀, then their inverses exist. So perhaps another assumption is that f and g are strictly monotonic (increasing) beyond a₀.\n\nBut the original problem didn't mention this. However, for inverses to exist, they must be injective (one-to-one) on the interval, which for functions typically requires strict monotonicity. So perhaps that's an implicit assumption. However, since the user didn't state it, but in their example, both functions are strictly increasing (2^x and x² for x > 0 are increasing). So to make the problem well-posed, we need to include that f and g are strictly increasing on x > a₀, ensuring invertibility.\n\nThus, the assumptions should include:\n\n- f is strictly increasing for all x > a₀.\n- g is strictly increasing for all x > a₀.\n- f and g are invertible for all x > a₀ (as a consequence of being strictly increasing).\n- For all x > a₀, f(x) > g(x).\n\nBut since invertibility follows from being strictly increasing, maybe the key assumptions are strict monotonicity and the inequality.\n\nAlternatively, in the example, the user didn't mention monotonicity but took inverses of functions that are increasing. So to structure the problem correctly, we should include the necessary conditions for the inverses to exist, which is that f and g are strictly increasing (or decreasing) on the interval. But since the reflection over y=x for the inverse would preserve the direction if both are increasing. If one is increasing and the other decreasing, it complicates things.\n\nHowever, the user's example has both functions increasing, so perhaps the assumption is that f and g are strictly increasing beyond a₀. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\n- f is strictly increasing for all x > a₀.\n- g is strictly increasing for all x > a₀.\n- For all x > a₀, f(x) > g(x).\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that there exists a real number b₀ such that for all x > b₀, f⁻¹(x) < g⁻¹(x).\n\nBecause with both functions increasing, their inverses are also increasing functions. Therefore, if f(x) > g(x), then for their inverses, to have f⁻¹(y) < g⁻¹(y), we need that y = f(x) > g(x), which would imply x = f⁻¹(y) and since g is increasing, g⁻¹(y) = x' where g(x') = y. But since f(x) > g(x) for x > a₀, then for y = f(x), g(x') = y would require x' < x (since g is increasing and g(x') = y < f(x) = y, wait no, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let's think. Suppose f and g are both increasing. For x > a₀, f(x) > g(x). Let y = f(x), then x = f⁻¹(y). Since f(x) > g(x), then y > g(x). But since g is increasing, g(x) = z implies x = g⁻¹(z). So y > g(x) => y > z, but x = g⁻¹(z). If y > z, then since g is increasing, g⁻¹(y) > g⁻¹(z) = x. So g⁻¹(y) > x = f⁻¹(y). Therefore, f⁻¹(y) < g⁻¹(y). Wait, this seems to hold.\n\nWait, let's formalize it. Let y be such that y > f(a₀) and y > g(a₀). Take y sufficiently large. Since f and g are increasing, for y > f(a₀), f⁻¹(y) > a₀. Similarly for g⁻¹(y) > a₀. Now, since f(f⁻¹(y)) = y > g(f⁻¹(y)) because f(x) > g(x) for x > a₀. Therefore, y > g(f⁻¹(y)). But g is increasing, so g⁻¹(y) > f⁻¹(y). Therefore, f⁻¹(y) < g⁻¹(y). Hence, proved.\n\nWait, this seems correct, but why does the example with f(x)=2^x and g(x)=x² work? For large x, 2^x > x², and log₂y < sqrt(y) for large y. But according to this proof, it should hold for all y > f(a₀), but in reality, sqrt(y) overtakes log₂y eventually. Wait, let's check with y. Suppose a₀ is such that for x > a₀, 2^x > x². Let's say a₀ = 10. Then for y > 2^{10} = 1024, log₂y > 10. Then sqrt(y) = y^{1/2}, log₂y = (ln y)/(ln 2). For y large enough, sqrt(y) grows faster than log₂y. So for sufficiently large y, sqrt(y) > log₂y. Which aligns with f⁻¹(y) < g⁻¹(y).\n\nBut according to the previous proof, for any y > f(a₀), we have f⁻¹(y) < g⁻¹(y). Wait, but in reality, it's only true for y sufficiently large. Wait, but the proof suggests it's true for all y > f(a₀). But in the example, even when y is just slightly larger than f(a₀), say y = 2^{a₀} + 1, then log₂y is just over a₀, and sqrt(y) is sqrt(2^{a₀} +1). Whether sqrt(y) > log₂y at that point depends on a₀. For example, if a₀ is 10, y=1025, log₂1025 ≈10.001, sqrt(1025)≈32.02, so sqrt(y) > log₂y. But if a₀ were lower, say a₀=5, then y=32 +1=33, log₂33≈5.044, sqrt(33)≈5.744, so sqrt(y) > log₂y. Hmm, in this case, it's true even for y just above f(a₀). So perhaps the proof is correct, and the intuition that it's \"eventual\" is because the functions may cross before a₀, but after a₀, once f(x) > g(x), then for all y > f(a₀), which is g(a₀) < f(a₀) < y, then f⁻¹(y) < g⁻¹(y). Wait, but if a₀ is chosen such that for x > a₀, f(x) > g(x), then for y > f(a₀), f⁻¹(y) > a₀, and since for x > a₀, f(x) > g(x), then y = f(f⁻¹(y)) > g(f⁻¹(y)). But g is increasing, so g⁻¹(y) > f⁻¹(y). Therefore, indeed f⁻¹(y) < g⁻¹(y) for all y > f(a₀). So the answer is yes, with b₀ = f(a₀).\n\nBut in the user's example, they mention \"for some b₀\", which could be larger than f(a₀), but according to the proof, it's true for all y > f(a₀). Therefore, the statement holds with b₀ = f(a₀). Therefore, the answer is yes, and it's always true given the assumptions. However, this requires that f and g are strictly increasing beyond a₀. If they are not strictly increasing, the inverses might not exist or the inequality might not hold.\n\nSo the key assumptions are:\n\n- f is strictly increasing for all x > a₀.\n- g is strictly increasing for all x > a₀.\n- For all x > a₀, f(x) > g(x).\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a real number b₀ such that for all x > b₀, f⁻¹(x) < g⁻¹(x).\n\nBut the user's original question is phrased as \"would it always be true...\", so the problem is to prove or disprove. Given the proof sketch above, the answer is yes, so the problem is to prove it.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list the assumptions (strictly increasing, invertible, inequality) and then the problem to prove the existence of b₀.\n\nThus:\n\nAssumption:\n- f is strictly increasing for all x > a₀.\n- g is strictly increasing for all x > a₀.\n- For all x > a₀, f(x) > g(x).\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a real number b₀ such that for all x > b₀, f⁻¹(x) < g⁻¹(x).\n\nBut the original problem statement from the user did not mention the functions being strictly increasing, but in their example, the functions are. To have the inverses exist and the conclusion hold, the strict increasing is necessary. Therefore, the assumptions should include that f and g are strictly increasing beyond a₀, which ensures invertibility and the direction of the inequality.\n\nHence, the final answer should have those assumptions.",
