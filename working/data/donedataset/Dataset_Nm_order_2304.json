    "Content": "Update. Based on @Exodd 's answer, it turns out that the upper bound is equal to $$ T_{2m}(\\cos x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{m} (-1)^k \\binom{1/2}{k}\\cos^{2k} x, $$ where $T_{2m}(x)$ is the degree $2m$ Taylor polynomial of $\\sqrt{1-x^2}$ . This completely settles down the questions asked below. (Check the community answer below.) Case closed! Old Question. While working to find a good upper bound of $\\left|\\sin x\\right|$ , I experimentally observed that $$ \\left|\\sin x\\right| \\leq \\bbox[color:navy]{ \\frac{(2m+1)!}{2^{4m}(m!)^2} \\biggl[ \\binom{2m}{m} - \\sum_{k=1}^{m} \\frac{2}{4k^2-1} \\binom{2m}{m+k} \\cos(2kx) \\biggr] } =: S_m(x) \\tag{*} $$ holds for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ . However, I have no idea how to prove this, and a quick search on Approach Zero but it did not show anything. So, I am sharing my question with other users: Question. Does the inequality $\\text{(*)}$ really hold true? If so, how can we prove this? Anyway, here are several observations: For each $m$ , $S_m(x)$ seems to be the unique trigonometric polynomial $\\sum_{k=0}^{m} a_k \\cos(2kx)$ satisfying $$ \\sum_{k=0}^{m} a_k \\cos(2kx) = \\sin(x) + o\\bigl(x-\\tfrac{\\pi}{2}\\bigr)^{2m}. $$ This is actually how I conjectured the coefficients of $S_m(x)$ . For each $m$ , I determinted the values of $a_k$ 's and tried to identify the patterns using OEIS. So, unfortunately I don't have a slightest idea as to how the coefficients of $S_m(x)$ arise. By noting that $\\frac{(2m+1)!}{2^{4m}(m!)^2}\\binom{2m}{m+k} \\to \\frac{2}{\\pi}$ as $m \\to \\infty$ , we get $$ \\lim_{m\\to\\infty} S_m(x) = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\biggl[ 1 - \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{2}{4k^2-1} \\cos(2kx) \\biggr]. $$ This is precisely the Fourier cosine series for $\\left|\\sin x\\right|$ . So, $\\text{(*)}$ is consistent with the Fourier series for $\\left|\\sin x\\right|$ . Surprisingly, $S_m(x)$ seems to be unimodal on $[0, \\pi]$ (and hence on each $[k\\pi, (k+1)\\pi]$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ ), as we can see from the figure below:",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Writing down $S_{m-1}(x) - S_{m}(x) \\ge 0$ you end up with the equivalent conditions $$\\binom{2m}{m} + 2\\sum_{k=1}^m \\binom{2m}{m+k}\\cos(2kx)\\ge 0$$ or equivalently $$\n\\sum_{k=-m}^m \\binom{2m}{m+k}\\exp(2\\text ikx)\\ge 0\n$$ but the LHS is just $[2\\cos(x)]^{2m}$ that is always nonnegative. I think you can then characterize $S_m(x)$ recursively as $$\nS_{m+1}(x) = S_{m}(x) - \\frac{2(2m)! }{2^{4m}(m!)^2(2m+3)} [2\\cos(x)]^{2m+2}\n$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this problem. The user is asking about proving an inequality involving trigonometric functions and binomial coefficients. The original problem is a bit long with some updates and observations, so I need to filter out the key parts.\n\nFirst, the main problem statement is the inequality |sin x| ≤ [some expression] for all real x. The user wants to know if this inequality holds and how to prove it. The expression given involves factorials, binomial coefficients, and a sum with cos(2kx) terms.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed as individual conditions. In this case, the problem seems to involve m being a non-negative integer (since it's used in factorials and sums up to m), and x being a real number. The user also mentions that the upper bound is related to the Taylor polynomial of sqrt(1 - x^2), but that's part of the problem's context, not an assumption.\n\nThe key assumptions here would be that m is an integer, m is non-negative (since factorials and binomial coefficients require non-negative integers), and x is a real number. The problem itself is to prove that the given inequality holds under these conditions.\n\nWait, the original problem mentions \"for all x ∈ ℝ\" and the structure is about proving that inequality. So the assumptions are m is a non-negative integer, x is a real number. The problem is to show that |sin x| is less than or equal to that expression S_m(x) for all real x.\n\nThe example given in the user's instruction had an assumption about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Similarly, here, m is an integer, and likely non-negative since it's used in summations and factorials. So the assumptions should list each condition separately: m is an integer, m is non-negative, x is a real number. Then the problem is to prove the inequality.\n\nI need to check if there are other implicit assumptions. The expression S_m(x) is defined with m, so m must be a non-negative integer (since the sum goes up to m and uses binomial coefficients). The user also mentions \"for each m\", so m is varying over non-negative integers. X is any real number. So the assumptions are m is a non-negative integer and x is real. Each of these should be listed as separate points in the assumption section.\n\nThe problem is to prove the inequality as stated. So the formatted problem would list these assumptions and then present the inequality as the problem statement.\n\nI think that's the core. The user's observations about the Fourier series and the Taylor polynomial are part of their exploration but not part of the problem's assumptions. The main task is to prove the inequality given m is a non-negative integer and x is real.",
