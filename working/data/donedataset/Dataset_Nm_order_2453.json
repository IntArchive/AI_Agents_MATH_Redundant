    "Content": "Possible Duplicates: Nonzero $f \\in C([0, 1])$ for which $\\int_0^1 f(x)x^n dx = 0$ for all $n$ Slight generalization of an exercise in (blue) Rudin What can we say about $f$ if $\\int_0^1 f(x)p(x)dx=0$ for all polynomials $p$ ? I found a nice problem I would like to share. Problem: If $f$ is continuous on $[0,1]$ , and if $$\\int_0^1 f(x)x^n \\ dx =0$$ for every non-negative integer $n$ , prove that $f(x)=0$ on $[0,1]$ . Source: W. Rudin, Principles of Mathematical Analysis , Chapter 7, Exercise 20. I have posted a proposed solution in the answers.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "We will show that the integral of $f^2$ over $[0,1]$ is 0. This will show that $f$ is zero, because if $f$ were not identically equal to zero, $f^2$ would be positive on some interval (by continuity) and have a nonzero integral. Using the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, we can approximate $f$ uniformly by polynomials $P_n$ so that $||P_n-f||<1/n$ in the $\\sup$ norm. The given condition obviously implies that the integral of $f(x)P(x)$ is zero for any polynomial $P$, by linearity. Note that $$\\left|\\int_0^1 f(x)f(x) \\ dx \\right|=\\left|\\int_0^1 f(x)f(x) \\ dx - \\int_0^1 f(x)P_n(x)\\right|\\le \\int_0^1 |f(x)| |f(x)-P_n(x)|\\ dx \\\\\\le \\frac{1}{n}\\int_0^1 |f(x)| \\ dx.$$ The last integral is constant, so taking $n$ arbitrarily large completes the proof.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify the key assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe original question is about a continuous function f on [0,1] such that the integral of f(x) multiplied by x^n from 0 to 1 is zero for every non-negative integer n. The goal is to prove that f is identically zero on [0,1].\n\nSo, the assumptions here are:\n\n1. f is continuous on the interval [0,1]. That's one condition applied to the function f.\n2. For every non-negative integer n, the integral of f(x)x^n dx from 0 to 1 equals zero. This is another condition, also applied to f.\n\nThe problem is to prove that f(x) = 0 for all x in [0,1]. \n\nI need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object. The first assumption is about the continuity of f on the interval. The second is about the integral condition for all non-negative integers n. Then the problem statement is to show f is zero everywhere on [0,1].\n\nI should check if there are any other implicit assumptions. The problem mentions that f is continuous, so that's explicit. The integral condition is given for all n ≥ 0. There's no mention of differentiability or anything else, so those two assumptions are sufficient. \n\nI need to make sure not to include any extra information from the original post, like the possible duplicates or the source reference. The example provided in the user's instruction also filtered out similar references. So, the formatted problem should only include the essential assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the structured problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is continuous on [0, 1],\nFor every non-negative integer n, ∫₀¹ f(x)xⁿ dx = 0.\nProblem:\nProve that f(x) = 0 on [0, 1].\n\nYes, that seems to capture all necessary parts without any extra info. Each assumption is a single condition applied to f. The problem is clearly stated.",
