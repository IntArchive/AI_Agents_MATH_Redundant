    "Content": "The following is exercise 15 in section V.1 of Conway's Functions of One Complex Variable (\"Classification of Singularities\"). I'm currently studying for a complex analysis qualifying exam and this has appeared in the past. Let $f$ be analytic in $G=\\{z:0<|z-a|&ltr\\}$ except that there is a sequence of poles $\\{a_n\\}$ in $G$ with $a_n\\rightarrow a$. Show that for any $w$ in $\\mathbb{C}$ there is a sequence $\\{z_n\\}$ in $G$ with $a=\\lim z_n$ and $w=\\lim f(z)$. The conclusion makes me want to apply the Casorati-Weirstrass theorem. However, the singularity at $a$ is not isolated. As far as I know, an essential singularity is a particular type of isolated singularity. Am I wrong about this? Any help would be greatly appreciated.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So the problem is about complex analysis, specifically singularities. The setup is that we have a function f that's analytic in a punctured disk G around a point a, except for a sequence of poles {a_n} that converge to a. We need to show that for any complex number w, there's a sequence {z_n} in G approaching a such that f(z_n) approaches w.\n\nThe user mentions the Casorati-Weierstrass theorem, which I remember says that if a function has an essential singularity at a point, then the image of any neighborhood of that point is dense in the complex plane. But they also note that in this case, the singularity at a isn't isolated because there are poles accumulating at a. Normally, essential singularities are isolated, right? So the user is confused because if the singularity isn't isolated, does that mean we can't apply Casorati-Weierstrass?\n\nFirst, let's recall some definitions. An isolated singularity is one where the function is analytic in a punctured neighborhood around the point, except at that point itself. Here, since there are poles accumulating at a, the function isn't analytic in any punctured neighborhood around a—there are poles getting arbitrarily close to a. Therefore, a is not an isolated singularity. Essential singularities are a type of isolated singularity, so if the singularity isn't isolated, it can't be essential. But the conclusion we need to reach is similar to Casorati-Weierstrass: the function comes arbitrarily close to any complex value w near a. \n\nSo the question is, how do we approach this? The user is right that Casorati-Weierstrass doesn't apply directly here because the singularity isn't isolated. Maybe we need to construct the sequence {z_n} explicitly. Since there are poles accumulating at a, near each pole a_n, the function f(z) goes to infinity as z approaches a_n. But between these poles, maybe the function takes on a lot of different values. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that near each pole, the function has a Laurent series expansion with a principal part. But since the poles are accumulating at a, the behavior near a might be wild. Maybe we can use a similar approach to Casorati-Weierstrass by considering the behavior near each pole and between them. \n\nAnother thought: if we can show that the set of values that f approaches near a is dense, then we're done. To do this, we might take an arbitrary w and, for each neighborhood around a, find a point z_n in that neighborhood where f(z_n) is close to w. Since there are poles accumulating at a, the function must oscillate wildly between these poles, perhaps taking on all complex values except possibly one (like in Picard's theorem, but that's for essential singularities). However, Picard's theorem requires an isolated essential singularity, which we don't have here. \n\nWait, but maybe even without isolated singularity, the accumulation of poles creates a similar dense image. Suppose we take a small disk around a, say of radius ε. In this disk, there are infinitely many poles a_n. Between these poles, the function is analytic except at the poles themselves. So in any small annulus around a, the function has poles but is otherwise analytic. How does the function behave there? Near each pole, the function blows up, but between the poles, maybe it's bounded? If it's bounded, then by Riemann's removable singularity theorem, the singularity at a would be removable, which contradicts the existence of poles approaching a. Therefore, the function must be unbounded in every neighborhood of a. But unboundedness doesn't directly imply density of the image. \n\nAlternatively, consider approaching a along different paths. If we approach a avoiding the poles, maybe the function behaves nicely, but since the poles are dense around a, any path approaching a will get close to infinitely many poles. So near each pole, the function goes to infinity, but in between, maybe it takes on a wide range of values. \n\nPerhaps we can use the sequence of poles to construct the sequence z_n. For each n, near the pole a_n, there's a point z_n close to a_n where f(z_n) is close to w. But how? Wait, near a pole, the function tends to infinity, so maybe we need to look not too close to the pole. For example, if we take a small circle around a_n with radius shrinking sufficiently fast as n increases, maybe on that circle, f(z) takes on all values with modulus greater than some large number. But how to get near a specific w? \n\nAlternatively, maybe use the fact that between the poles, the function is analytic, so by the open mapping theorem, it's open except for values where the function is constant, which it's not since there are poles. So between any two poles, the function is open, meaning it maps open sets to open sets, so the image should be dense. But I need to make this precise. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for a sequence z_n approaching a such that f(z_n) approaches w. So given any w, we need to find such a sequence. Perhaps using a diagonal argument? For each n, consider the annulus around a with radius between 1/(n+1) and 1/n. In each annulus, there are poles a_k, but also regions where the function is analytic. Maybe in each such annulus, we can find a point z_n where f(z_n) is within 1/n of w. Then as n goes to infinity, z_n approaches a and f(z_n) approaches w. \n\nBut how do we guarantee that such z_n exists in each annulus? Since the function has poles in each annulus, maybe near those poles, the function covers all large values, but we need to get arbitrary w. Wait, but if we can get close to any w by approaching different parts near the poles. Alternatively, perhaps use the Casorati-Weierstrass theorem on each annulus? But the function isn't analytic in the whole annulus, just in the annulus minus the poles. \n\nAlternatively, consider that in any punctured neighborhood of a, the function has poles, but between those poles, it's analytic. So maybe in each such neighborhood, the function comes arbitrarily close to any value except near the poles where it goes to infinity. But how to formalize this? \n\nAnother approach: Suppose, for contradiction, that there exists some w in C and some ε > 0 and δ > 0 such that |f(z) - w| ≥ ε whenever |z - a| < δ. Then consider the function g(z) = 1/(f(z) - w). This would be analytic in 0 < |z - a| < δ except at the poles of f(z). But at the poles of f(z), g(z) tends to 0. So perhaps g(z) has removable singularities at the poles of f(z), making g(z) analytic in the entire punctured disk 0 < |z - a| < δ with zeros accumulating at a. Then by the identity theorem, g(z) would be identically zero, which is a contradiction because f(z) is not constant. Therefore, our assumption must be wrong, and such a sequence z_n exists. \n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me check again. If we assume that |f(z) - w| ≥ ε near a, then g(z) = 1/(f(z) - w) is bounded by 1/ε in some punctured neighborhood of a. The singularities at the poles of f(z) would be removable because g(z) tends to 0 there. So after removing them, g(z) is analytic in the punctured disk and bounded, so by Riemann's removable singularity theorem, it extends to an analytic function at a. But then g(z) has zeros accumulating at a, so g(z) is identically zero near a, meaning f(z) - w is infinity everywhere, which is impossible since f(z) has poles but isn't identically infinity. Therefore, the assumption that |f(z) - w| ≥ ε near a is false, so there must be points z_n approaching a with f(z_n) approaching w. \n\nYes, that seems like the right approach. So even though the singularity at a is not isolated, we can use a similar argument to Casorati-Weierstrass by considering the reciprocal function and applying Riemann's theorem. This shows that the conclusion holds even for non-isolated singularities where poles accumulate. Therefore, the problem is solved by adapting the Casorati-Weierstrass proof to this scenario.",
