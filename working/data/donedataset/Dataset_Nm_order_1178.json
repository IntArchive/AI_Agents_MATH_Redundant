    "Content": "Prove that every number ending in a $3$ has a multiple which consists only of ones. Eg. $3$ has $111$, $13$ has $111111$. Also, is their any direct way (without repetitive multiplication and checking) of obtaining such  multiple of any given number( ending with $3$) ?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The number $111...11$ with $n+1$ digits is $1 + 10 + ... + 10^n = \\frac{10^{n+1} - 1}{9}$ using the formula for geometric progressions. Now any number $x$ which ends in three is coprime to $10$, and so is $9x$: $10$ is a unit $\\mod 9x$.  In particular, you have the Euler-Fermat theorem: $10^{\\varphi(9x)} \\equiv 1 \\mod 9x$.  This means that $9x$ divides $10^{\\varphi(9x)} - 1$, so $x$ divides $\\frac{10^{\\varphi(9x)} - 1}{9}$. So $x$ divides the number $111..11$ with $\\varphi(9x)$ digits, where $\\varphi$ is Euler's phi function.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to format a question from Math Stack Exchange into the specified structure. The original question is about proving that every number ending in 3 has a multiple consisting only of ones. There's also a part about finding a direct method to obtain such a multiple without repetitive multiplication. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. The example provided shows that assumptions should be specific, one per line, each addressing a single property or condition of one object. \n\nLooking at the original problem: \"Prove that every number ending in a 3 has a multiple which consists only of ones.\" The key points here are:\n\n1. The number ends with 3. So the assumption is that the number's last digit is 3.\n2. The problem is to prove the existence of such a multiple composed solely of ones.\n\nAdditionally, the second part of the question asks if there's a direct way to find this multiple without repetitive checking. However, the example given in the user's instruction only includes the main problem, not the additional question. But since the user wants the problem structured as per the format, maybe the second part is part of the problem statement.\n\nSo, the assumptions would be:\n- The number is an integer.\n- The number ends with the digit 3.\n\nThe problem statement includes proving the existence of such a multiple and asking about a direct method. But the example provided by the user only includes the main problem in the \"Problem:\" section. The additional question might be considered part of the problem. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem had two parts: proving divisibility and asking about a direct method. However, in the formatted problem, only the first part was included. Wait, the example given by the user had the original problem mentioning both proving divisibility by 91 and then the formatted problem included only the first part. Wait, let me check:\n\nOriginal example problem: \"Prove that for every integer $n$, the number... Also, is their any direct way...\"\n\nFormatted problem includes only the first part in the problem section. The additional question is omitted. So perhaps the user wants only the main problem in the \"Problem:\" section and the assumptions to be the necessary conditions. Wait, no. The example had the original problem mentioning both the proof and the question about a direct method, but in the formatted problem, only the proof part is included. So maybe the user wants only the main problem to be in the Problem section, and the additional question is considered part of the problem. Wait, in the example, the original problem had \"Prove that... Also, is their any direct way...\" but the formatted problem only includes \"Prove that...\". So the additional question is omitted. Therefore, perhaps the user wants only the main problem to be in the Problem section, and the additional part is ignored. But that might not be the case here. Let me read the user's instruction again.\n\nThe user says: \"structure that problem as the following format. You will be given some example which I structured before.\"\n\nIn the example, the original problem had two parts: the proof and the question about a direct method. The formatted problem included only the proof part. Therefore, perhaps the user wants only the main problem (the proof part) to be in the Problem section, and the additional question is considered part of the problem but maybe needs to be included. Wait, in the example, the original problem had two sentences, but the formatted problem included only the first. Therefore, maybe the user wants to split them. Alternatively, perhaps the additional question is considered a separate problem. But the user's instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\", implying that each problem is treated individually. However, in the example, the original problem had two parts but the formatted problem included only the first. Therefore, perhaps the user wants only the main problem to be structured, and any additional questions are to be ignored or considered as part of the problem. Alternatively, maybe the additional question is part of the problem statement. Let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal example problem:\n\"Prove that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\"\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = ...$$ is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, the original problem didn't mention that $n$ is divisible by 7. The user added that as an assumption. So perhaps the user is modifying the original problem to include assumptions. Wait, no. The user's example shows that the original problem was to prove for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Because if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", the assumption shouldn't be that n is divisible by 7. This suggests that perhaps the user is providing an example of how they want the problem structured, even if the example has an error. Therefore, I should follow the format regardless of correctness.\n\nTherefore, in the current problem, the original question is: \"Prove that every number ending in a 3 has a multiple which consists only of ones. Eg. 3 has 111, 13 has 111111. Also, is their any direct way (without repetitive multiplication and checking) of obtaining such multiple of any given number( ending with 3) ?\"\n\nFollowing the example's structure, the assumptions should list properties of the object (the number ending with 3). The problem statement would be the main part. However, the example added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (n divisible by 7). So perhaps the user is expecting to extract all possible assumptions from the problem, even if they are implicit.\n\nIn this case, the problem is about numbers ending with 3. So the assumption is that the number ends with 3. But in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that's conflicting. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\", which changes the problem. That seems like a mistake. Maybe the user provided a wrong example. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants to list all conditions, even if they are part of the problem's universal quantifier.\n\nBut I'm supposed to follow the format given. So for the current problem, \"every number ending in a 3\" would translate to the assumption that the number is an integer ending with 3. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe number is an integer,\nThe number ends with the digit 3.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the number has a multiple consisting only of ones. Also, is there any direct way (without repetitive multiplication and checking) of obtaining such a multiple for any given number ending with 3?\n\nBut in the example, the additional question was omitted. Wait, in the example, the original problem had \"Also, is their any direct way...\" but the formatted problem only included the first part. So maybe the user wants to include both parts in the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps the additional question is a separate problem, but according to the user's example, it's included in the problem section. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem had \"Prove that... Also, is their any direct way...\", and in the formatted problem, only the first part is included. So the user's example omits the additional question. Therefore, perhaps I should do the same here. So the problem section would be only the first part: \"Prove that every number ending in a 3 has a multiple which consists only of ones.\" But wait, the original problem includes examples, which are not part of the assumptions or problem statement.\n\nSo the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe number is an integer,\nThe number ends with the digit 3.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the number has a multiple consisting only of ones.\n\nBut the original problem also includes the additional question about a direct method. Since the example omitted the additional part, maybe we should include it in the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps it's part of the problem. The user's example included only the main problem, so perhaps I should do the same here. However, in the original example, the user's formatted problem included only the first part of the question. But in reality, the example's formatted problem might have been incorrect. Given that, perhaps the user intended to include both parts in the problem statement. But to adhere to the example's structure, where the additional question was omitted, perhaps I should do the same. But the user's example had a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to include the entire problem statement as is, just structured.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I think the safest approach is to include both parts in the problem statement, as they are both part of the original problem. Therefore, the problem section would be:\n\nProblem:\nProve that every number ending in a 3 has a multiple which consists only of ones. Also, is there any direct way (without repetitive multiplication and checking) of obtaining such a multiple for any given number ending with 3?\n\nBut the example's formatted problem did not include the \"Also...\" part. Therefore, perhaps the user wants only the main problem. But given that the user included both in the example's original problem, but the formatted one only included the first, maybe the user wants to split them. However, since the user hasn't specified, and the example shows that the formatted problem includes only the first part, I will follow that.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe number is an integer,\nThe number ends with the digit 3.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the number has a multiple consisting only of ones.\n\nBut the original problem's first sentence is \"Prove that every number ending in a 3 has a multiple which consists only of ones.\" So the problem statement is exactly that. The assumptions are that the number is an integer ending with 3.\n\nSo the final formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe number is an integer,\nThe number ends with the digit 3.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the number has a multiple consisting only of ones.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the assumptions were about the variable in the problem. Here, the problem is about numbers ending with 3, so the assumptions are about the number (which is an integer ending with 3). The problem statement is to prove that such a number has a multiple consisting only of ones. The additional question about a direct method is part of the original problem, but perhaps it's considered a separate problem. However, since the user's example included only the first part, maybe we should do the same here. Alternatively, the user might want to include both parts in the problem statement. But given the example, it's safer to include only the first part.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe number is an integer,\nThe number ends with the digit 3.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the number has a multiple consisting only of ones.\n\nThe additional question about a direct method would be a separate problem, but since the user's example didn't include it, perhaps it's omitted. However, the original problem includes both. To comply with the example's structure, where the additional part was omitted, perhaps it's better to include both in the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps the user's example had a mistake, and the formatted problem should include both parts. But given the example's formatting, I think it's intended to split the problem into assumptions and the main problem, even if the original problem has multiple parts. But in the example, the original problem had a universal quantifier (\"for every integer n\") which was split into assumptions. In this case, the problem is \"every number ending in 3\", so the assumptions are that the number is an integer ending with 3. Therefore, the formatted problem would be as above.",
