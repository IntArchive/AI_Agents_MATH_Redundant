    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The question is asking whether the inequality \n\n$$\n[(a_1 + b_1)(a_2 + b_2) \\cdots (a_n + b_n)]^{1/n} \\geq (a_1 a_2 \\cdots a_n)^{1/n} + (b_1 b_2 \\cdots b_n)^{1/n}\n$$\n\nholds for all positive numbers $a_i$ and $b_i$, and if so, how to prove it. \n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have two sequences of positive numbers, $\\{a_i\\}$ and $\\{b_i\\}$, each of length $n$. The inequality compares the geometric mean of the sums $(a_i + b_i)$ to the sum of the geometric means of the individual sequences. \n\nThe geometric mean of a set of numbers is the nth root of their product. So, the left-hand side (LHS) is the geometric mean of all the $(a_i + b_i)$ terms, and the right-hand side (RHS) is the sum of the geometric means of the $a_i$s and the $b_i$s separately.\n\nI remember that inequalities involving geometric means often use the AM ≥ GM inequality. Maybe that can be applied here somehow. Let me think about how to relate the terms.\n\nLet me denote the geometric mean of the $a_i$s as $G_a = (a_1 a_2 \\cdots a_n)^{1/n}$ and similarly $G_b = (b_1 b_2 \\cdots b_n)^{1/n}$. The RHS is $G_a + G_b$. The LHS is the geometric mean of each $(a_i + b_i)$. \n\nIf I can express each $(a_i + b_i)$ in a way that relates to $a_i$ and $b_i$ individually, perhaps I can apply some inequality. For example, for each term $(a_i + b_i)$, maybe I can relate it to the geometric mean or something else. Wait, the AM ≥ GM inequality tells us that $(a_i + b_i)/2 \\geq \\sqrt{a_i b_i}$, but I'm not sure if that's directly helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Hölder's inequality or the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality can be applied. Hölder's inequality is a generalization that might relate products and sums in a way that's useful here. Let me recall Hölder's inequality: For sequences of non-negative real numbers and conjugate exponents $p$ and $q$ (i.e., $1/p + 1/q = 1$), we have \n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i b_i \\leq \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^p \\right)^{1/p} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n b_i^q \\right)^{1/q}\n$$\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here. Alternatively, the Minkowski inequality, which is about the inequality for sums in L^p spaces. The Minkowski inequality states that for $p \\geq 1$,\n\n$$\n\\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n (a_i + b_i)^p \\right)^{1/p} \\leq \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^p \\right)^{1/p} + \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n b_i^p \\right)^{1/p}\n$$\n\nBut this is for sums of powers, not products. Wait, but in the case of $p=1$, Minkowski becomes the triangle inequality. However, our problem involves products, not sums. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the arithmetic mean-geometric mean (AM-GM) inequality on the product terms. Let's take the product on the left-hand side:\n\n$$\n\\prod_{i=1}^n (a_i + b_i)\n$$\n\nIf I expand this product, it would result in the sum of all possible products where each term is either $a_i$ or $b_i$. But expanding it might not be helpful directly. However, maybe comparing it to the product of $a_i$s and $b_i$s.\n\nAlternatively, think about logarithms. Since geometric mean involves products and roots, taking logarithms can convert products into sums. Let's try that.\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nLeft-hand side (LHS) after log:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\ln(a_i + b_i)\n$$\n\nRight-hand side (RHS) after log:\n$$\n\\ln \\left( (G_a + G_b) \\right) = \\ln \\left( \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^n a_i \\right)^{1/n} + \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^n b_i \\right)^{1/n} \\right)\n$$\n\nBut this seems complicated because the logarithm of a sum isn't easily comparable. Maybe this approach isn't the best.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe use induction on $n$. Let's check for $n=1$ first. If $n=1$, the inequality becomes:\n\n$$\n(a_1 + b_1)^{1/1} \\geq (a_1)^{1/1} + (b_1)^{1/1}\n$$\n\nWhich simplifies to $a_1 + b_1 \\geq a_1 + b_1$, which is true. So equality holds for $n=1$. Wait, that's just an equality. Hmm. Maybe the base case is okay. Now, assume it holds for $n=k$, then try to show for $n=k+1$. But induction might be tricky here because adding another term complicates the product.\n\nAlternatively, consider the case when all $a_i$ and $b_i$ are equal. Suppose $a_i = a$ and $b_i = b$ for all $i$. Then the LHS becomes $(a + b)^n$^{1/n} = a + b. The RHS becomes $(a^n)^{1/n} + (b^n)^{1/n} = a + b. So equality holds here as well. So when all the terms are equal, the inequality becomes equality. That suggests that perhaps the inequality is true, and equality holds when all $a_i$ and $b_i$ are proportional or equal.\n\nAnother test case: Let n=2, take specific numbers. Let me choose a1=1, a2=1, b1=1, b2=1. Then LHS is [(1+1)(1+1)]^{1/2} = (4)^{1/2} = 2. RHS is (1*1)^{1/2} + (1*1)^{1/2} = 1 + 1 = 2. Equality holds.\n\nAnother test case: Let n=2, a1=2, a2=2, b1=1, b2=1. LHS is [(2+1)(2+1)]^{1/2} = (9)^{1/2} = 3. RHS is (2*2)^{1/2} + (1*1)^{1/2} = 2 + 1 = 3. Equality again. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe if I choose different numbers. Let's try n=2, a1=3, a2=3, b1=1, b2=1. LHS: (4*4)^(1/2)=4. RHS: (9)^(1/2) + (1)^(1/2)=3 +1=4. Still equality. Wait, this seems to always hold with equality if all a_i and b_i are the same across i. Maybe when a_i and b_i are proportional for each i, we get equality. But if they are not proportional, maybe the inequality is strict?\n\nWait, let's try a case where a_i and b_i are not the same. For example, n=2, a1=1, a2=4, b1=1, b2=1. Then LHS is [(1+1)(4+1)]^{1/2} = (2*5)^{1/2} = sqrt(10) ≈3.16. RHS is (1*4)^{1/2} + (1*1)^{1/2} = 2 +1=3. So 3.16 ≥3. So inequality holds. Another case: a1=2, a2=3, b1=1, b2=1. LHS: (3*4)^{1/2} = sqrt(12)≈3.464. RHS: (6)^{1/2} + (1)^{1/2} ≈2.45 +1≈3.45. So 3.464≥3.45. Holds, but barely.\n\nAnother test: a1=1, a2=1, b1=2, b2=2. LHS: (3*3)^{1/2}=3. RHS: (1)^{1/2} + (4)^{1/2}=1 +2=3. Equality again. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the inequality is actually an equality when for each i, $a_i/b_i$ is constant. That is, if there exists a constant k such that $a_i = k b_i$ for all i. For example, let k=2, then a_i=2b_i for all i. Then LHS becomes product of (2b_i + b_i)=3b_i, so geometric mean is 3 times the geometric mean of b_i. RHS would be geometric mean of a_i, which is 2 times geometric mean of b_i, plus geometric mean of b_i. So total 3 times geometric mean of b_i. So equality holds.\n\nBut in the previous example where a1=1, a2=4, b1=1, b2=1, which is not proportional, the inequality was strict. So perhaps the inequality holds in general, with equality when $a_i$ and $b_i$ are proportional for all i.\n\nTherefore, the inequality seems to hold, and maybe can be proven using the AM-GM inequality or another inequality.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider using the AM-GM inequality on each term $(a_i + b_i)$. For each term,\n\n$$\na_i + b_i \\geq 2 \\sqrt{a_i b_i}\n$$\n\nby AM-GM. Then, taking the product over all i,\n\n$$\n\\prod_{i=1}^n (a_i + b_i) \\geq \\prod_{i=1}^n 2 \\sqrt{a_i b_i} = 2^n \\prod_{i=1}^n \\sqrt{a_i b_i} = 2^n \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^n a_i \\prod_{i=1}^n b_i \\right)^{1/2}\n$$\n\nTaking the nth root of both sides,\n\n$$\n\\left( \\prod_{i=1}^n (a_i + b_i) \\right)^{1/n} \\geq 2 \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^n a_i \\prod_{i=1}^n b_i \\right)^{1/(2n)} = 2 \\left( G_a G_b \\right)^{1/2}\n$$\n\nBut the RHS of the original inequality is $G_a + G_b$. So we have:\n\n$$\nLHS \\geq 2 \\sqrt{G_a G_b}\n$$\n\nBut by AM-GM again, $G_a + G_b \\geq 2 \\sqrt{G_a G_b}$. So combining these,\n\n$$\nLHS \\geq 2 \\sqrt{G_a G_b} \\leq G_a + G_b\n$$\n\nWait, but this doesn't help because we have LHS ≥ 2√(G_a G_b), and RHS ≥ 2√(G_a G_b). So we can't directly compare LHS and RHS through this. For example, if LHS is greater than or equal to 2√(G_a G_b), and RHS is also greater than or equal to 2√(G_a G_b), but which one is bigger? This approach doesn't establish the required inequality.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe use the Minkowski inequality for integrals or products. Wait, Minkowski is usually for sums, but maybe there's a version for products. Alternatively, use induction.\n\nLet me try induction. Base case n=1, which we saw holds as equality. Assume it holds for n=k, then for n=k+1, we need to show that:\n\n[(a1 + b1)...(ak+1 + bk+1)]^{1/(k+1)} ≥ (a1...ak+1)^{1/(k+1)} + (b1...bk+1)^{1/(k+1)}.\n\nBut I don't see an obvious way to apply the induction hypothesis here. Maybe it's not straightforward.\n\nAnother approach: Use the inequality between the arithmetic mean and geometric mean for each term. Wait, but we need a different approach here.\n\nWait, think of Hölder's inequality. Hölder's ineq can relate products and sums. Let me recall Hölder's inequality:\n\nFor conjugate exponents p and q (1/p + 1/q = 1), we have:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i y_i| \\leq \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i|^p \\right)^{1/p} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n |y_i|^q \\right)^{1/q}\n$$\n\nBut in our case, we have products over terms. Maybe use the multiplicative version of Hölder's inequality. Wait, there's a Hölder's inequality for products which states that:\n\n$$\n\\prod_{i=1}^n (a_i + b_i) \\geq \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^n a_i^{1/p} \\right)^p + \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^n b_i^{1/q} \\right)^q\n$$\n\n Not sure. Alternatively, maybe use the generalized Hölder inequality which involves multiple functions.\n\nAlternatively, consider using the inequality that for positive numbers, the geometric mean is concave. Wait, but the geometric mean is actually log-concave, which might be useful.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider taking the inequality and raising both sides to the nth power to eliminate the roots. So the inequality becomes:\n\n$$\n\\prod_{i=1}^n (a_i + b_i) \\geq \\left( \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^n a_i \\right)^{1/n} + \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^n b_i \\right)^{1/n} \\right)^n\n$$\n\nExpanding the right-hand side using the binomial theorem:\n\n$$\n\\left( G_a + G_b \\right)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} G_a^{k} G_b^{n - k}\n$$\n\nSo the inequality is:\n\n$$\n\\prod_{i=1}^n (a_i + b_i) \\geq \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} G_a^{k} G_b^{n - k}\n$$\n\nBut I'm not sure if this expansion helps. Alternatively, compare term by term. For example, when expanding the left-hand side product, each term is a product of either $a_i$ or $b_i$ for each i. The expansion would include terms like $a_1 a_2 \\cdots a_n$ (which is $G_a^n$), $b_1 b_2 \\cdots b_n$ (which is $G_b^n$), and all the cross terms where some are $a_i$ and some are $b_i$. So the left-hand side includes $G_a^n + G_b^n$ plus other positive terms. Meanwhile, the right-hand side is $G_a^n + G_b^n + \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n}{k} G_a^k G_b^{n - k}$. Therefore, the left-hand side has more terms than the right-hand side, but it's not clear if each corresponding term in the RHS is less than or equal to the terms in the LHS.\n\nWait, but this approach might not work because the cross terms in the LHS are products of different combinations of $a_i$s and $b_i$s, which may not directly correspond to the terms in the binomial expansion on the RHS.\n\nAlternative idea: Use the concept of mixed volumes or log-concavity. But I might be overcomplicating.\n\nWait, let's consider using the AM-GM inequality on the entire product. Suppose we write each $(a_i + b_i) = a_i + b_i \\geq 2 \\sqrt{a_i b_i}$, as before. Then, the product is at least $2^n \\sqrt{\\prod a_i b_i}$. Taking the nth root gives $2 \\sqrt{ \\left( \\prod a_i b_i \\right)^{1/n} } = 2 \\sqrt{ G_a G_b }$. But the RHS of the original inequality is $G_a + G_b$, which is at least $2 \\sqrt{ G_a G_b }$ by AM-GM. Therefore, combining these gives:\n\n$$\nLHS \\geq 2 \\sqrt{G_a G_b} \\leq G_a + G_b = RHS\n$$\n\nWait, no, this gives LHS ≥ 2√(G_a G_b) and RHS ≥ 2√(G_a G_b), but we need to show LHS ≥ RHS. This approach shows that both sides are at least 2√(G_a G_b), but it doesn't establish a direct relation between LHS and RHS.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe use the inequality in logarithmic terms. Let’s define $x_i = \\ln a_i$ and $y_i = \\ln b_i$. Then, the geometric mean of $a_i$ is $\\exp\\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\sum x_i \\right)$ and similarly for $b_i$. The LHS becomes $\\exp\\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\sum \\ln(a_i + b_i) \\right)$ and the RHS is $\\exp\\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\sum x_i \\right) + \\exp\\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\sum y_i \\right)$. Taking logs, we would need to show:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{n} \\sum \\ln(a_i + b_i) \\geq \\ln\\left( \\exp\\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\sum x_i \\right) + \\exp\\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\sum y_i \\right) \\right)\n$$\n\nBut I don't know if this helps. It might not be easier to handle.\n\nWait, perhaps consider the function $f(a_1, \\dots, a_n, b_1, \\dots, b_n) = \\text{LHS} - \\text{RHS}$. We need to show that this is non-negative for all positive $a_i, b_i$. Maybe use Lagrange multipliers to find minima, but this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, use substitution to reduce variables. For example, set $c_i = a_i / b_i$, then the inequality becomes:\n\n$$\n\\left( \\prod_{i=1}^n b_i (c_i + 1) \\right)^{1/n} \\geq \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^n b_i c_i \\right)^{1/n} + \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^n b_i \\right)^{1/n}\n$$\n\nDividing both sides by $\\left( \\prod b_i \\right)^{1/n}$, we get:\n\n$$\n\\left( \\prod_{i=1}^n (c_i + 1) \\right)^{1/n} \\geq \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^n c_i \\right)^{1/n} + 1\n$$\n\nLet’s denote $C = \\left( \\prod c_i \\right)^{1/n}$, which is the geometric mean of the $c_i$s. Then the inequality becomes:\n\n$$\n\\left( \\prod (c_i + 1) \\right)^{1/n} \\geq C + 1\n$$\n\nSo now, the problem is reduced to showing that for positive real numbers $c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_n$, the geometric mean of $(c_i + 1)$ is at least the geometric mean of $c_i$ plus 1.\n\nThis seems more manageable. Let me denote $D = \\prod (c_i + 1)^{1/n}$. We need to show $D \\geq C + 1$, where $C = \\prod c_i^{1/n}$.\n\nTake logarithms:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{n} \\sum \\ln(c_i + 1) \\geq \\ln(C + 1)\n$$\n\nBut this might not be helpful. Alternatively, consider using induction again on this transformed problem.\n\nBase case n=1: $c_1 +1 \\geq c_1 +1$, equality holds.\n\nAssume true for n=k. For n=k+1, need to show that:\n\n$$\n\\left( \\prod_{i=1}^{k+1} (c_i +1) \\right)^{1/(k+1)} \\geq \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^{k+1} c_i \\right)^{1/(k+1)} +1\n$$\n\nLet me denote $C' = \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^{k+1} c_i \\right)^{1/(k+1)}$. Then, the inequality is:\n\n$$\n\\left( \\prod_{i=1}^{k+1} (c_i +1) \\right)^{1/(k+1)} \\geq C' +1\n$$\n\nBut I don't see how the induction hypothesis helps here.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe use the AM-GM inequality on each term $(c_i +1)$.\n\nWe know that for each $i$, $c_i +1 \\geq 2 \\sqrt{c_i}$, by AM-GM. Then:\n\n$$\n\\prod (c_i +1) \\geq \\prod 2 \\sqrt{c_i} = 2^n \\prod c_i^{1/2}\n$$\n\nTaking the nth root:\n\n$$\n\\left( \\prod (c_i +1) \\right)^{1/n} \\geq 2 \\prod c_i^{1/(2n)} = 2 C^{1/2}\n$$\n\nBut we need to show that this is at least $C +1$. So:\n\n$$\n2 C^{1/2} \\geq C +1\n$$\n\nBut this inequality is equivalent to $0 \\geq C - 2 C^{1/2} +1 = (C^{1/2} -1)^2 \\geq 0$, which is only possible when $C^{1/2} -1 =0$, i.e., $C=1$. So this approach only gives that $LHS \\geq 2 \\sqrt{C}$, but $2 \\sqrt{C} \\geq C +1$ only when $C=1$. So this approach doesn't help for general $C$.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe consider the function $f(t) = \\ln(t +1)$, which is concave. Then, by Jensen's inequality,\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{n} \\sum \\ln(c_i +1) \\leq \\ln\\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\sum (c_i +1) \\right) = \\ln\\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\sum c_i +1 \\right)\n$$\n\nBut this goes in the opposite direction. Since the logarithm is concave, the inequality flips. This suggests that the geometric mean is less than or equal to the arithmetic mean, which is not helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the function $f(t) = \\ln(t +1)$, which is concave, then:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{n} \\sum \\ln(c_i +1) \\leq \\ln\\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\sum (c_i +1) \\right)\n$$\n\nBut we need the opposite inequality. So this might not be useful.\n\nWait, perhaps try using the weighted AM-GM inequality. Suppose we write each term $(c_i +1) = c_i +1 \\geq 2 \\sqrt{c_i}$, but as before, that only gives a lower bound of $2 \\sqrt{C}$.\n\nAlternatively, consider that for each $c_i$, $(c_i +1) \\geq c_i^{k} +1^{k}$ for some exponent k. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the inequality as a form of the Minkowski inequality for geometric means. The standard Minkowski inequality is for sums, but maybe there's an analogous version for products.\n\nAfter some research, I recall that there is a Minkowski-type inequality for geometric means, but I'm not sure of the exact form. Alternatively, the inequality might be proven using the Holder's inequality in a clever way.\n\nLet me consider applying Holder's inequality with exponents p and q such that 1/p +1/q =1. Let's choose p = n and q = n/(n-1). Then, Holder's inequality states that:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i y_i) \\leq \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^p \\right)^{1/p} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n y_i^q \\right)^{1/q}\n$$\n\nBut I need to relate this to the product of sums. Maybe another approach.\n\nWait, Holder's inequality in its product form can be written as:\n\n$$\n\\prod_{i=1}^n (a_i + b_i) \\geq \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^n a_i^{1/p} \\prod_{i=1}^n b_i^{1/q} \\right)^{something}\n$$\n\nNot sure. Alternatively, use the inequality in reverse. Let me think differently.\n\nLet’s assume that the inequality is true and try to manipulate it. Let’s denote $G_a = (a_1 a_2 \\cdots a_n)^{1/n}$ and $G_b = (b_1 b_2 \\cdots b_n)^{1/n}$. Then the inequality is:\n\n$$\n\\left( \\prod_{i=1}^n (a_i + b_i) \\right)^{1/n} \\geq G_a + G_b\n$$\n\nRaise both sides to the power of n:\n\n$$\n\\prod_{i=1}^n (a_i + b_i) \\geq (G_a + G_b)^n\n$$\n\nExpanding the right-hand side using the binomial theorem:\n\n$$\n(G_a + G_b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} G_a^k G_b^{n -k}\n$$\n\nNow, compare this to the left-hand side. When we expand the product on the left, we get the sum of all possible products where each term is either $a_i$ or $b_i$. Specifically, the left-hand side can be written as:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{S \\subseteq \\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}} \\prod_{i \\in S} a_i \\prod_{i \\notin S} b_i\n$$\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^n \\sum_{|S|=k} \\prod_{i \\in S} a_i \\prod_{i \\notin S} b_i\n$$\n\nFor each k, the term is the sum of all possible products with exactly k a's and (n -k) b's. The total sum is the expansion of the product $\\prod_{i=1}^n (a_i + b_i)$.\n\nNow, compare this to the RHS, which is the binomial expansion of $(G_a + G_b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} G_a^k G_b^{n -k}$.\n\nTo show that the LHS ≥ RHS, we need to show that for each k, the sum of the terms in the LHS with exactly k a's is ≥ the corresponding term in the RHS, i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\sum_{|S|=k} \\prod_{i \\in S} a_i \\prod_{i \\notin S} b_i \\geq \\binom{n}{k} G_a^k G_b^{n -k}\n$$\n\nIf this holds for all k, then summing over k would give the desired inequality.\n\nLet’s fix k. The left-hand side for each k is the sum over all subsets S of size k of the product of a_i for i in S and b_i for i not in S. The right-hand side is the binomial coefficient times G_a^k G_b^{n -k}.\n\nUsing the AM-GM inequality on the terms in the LHS sum for each k:\n\nThe number of terms in the sum for a fixed k is $\\binom{n}{k}$. By AM-GM,\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\binom{n}{k}} \\sum_{|S|=k} \\prod_{i \\in S} a_i \\prod_{i \\notin S} b_i \\geq \\left( \\prod_{|S|=k} \\prod_{i \\in S} a_i \\prod_{i \\notin S} b_i \\right)^{1/\\binom{n}{k}}\n$$\n\nBut the product over all subsets S of size k of the products $\\prod_{i \\in S} a_i \\prod_{i \\notin S} b_i$ is complicated. Let's try to compute this.\n\nEach a_i appears in $\\binom{n -1}{k -1}$ subsets of size k, and each b_i appears in $\\binom{n -1}{k}$ subsets of size k. Therefore, the exponent of a_i in the big product is $\\binom{n -1}{k -1}$, and the exponent of b_i is $\\binom{n -1}{k}$.\n\nThus, the product over all subsets S of size k of the products inside is:\n\n$$\n\\prod_{i=1}^n a_i^{\\binom{n -1}{k -1}} b_i^{\\binom{n -1}{k}}\n$$\n\nTherefore, the geometric mean on the RHS of the AM-GM inequality is:\n\n$$\n\\left( \\prod_{i=1}^n a_i^{\\binom{n -1}{k -1}} b_i^{\\binom{n -1}{k}} \\right)^{1/\\binom{n}{k}}\n$$\n\nSimplifying the exponents:\n\nFor each a_i, the exponent is $\\binom{n -1}{k -1} / \\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{(n-1)! / (k-1)! (n -k)!}{n! / k! (n -k)!)} } = \\frac{k}{n}$\n\nSimilarly, for each b_i, the exponent is $\\binom{n -1}{k} / \\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{(n -1)! / k! (n -k -1)!}{n! /k! (n -k)!)} } = \\frac{n -k}{n}$\n\nTherefore, the geometric mean becomes:\n\n$$\n\\prod_{i=1}^n a_i^{k/n} b_i^{(n -k)/n} = \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^n a_i \\right)^{k/n} \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^n b_i \\right)^{(n -k)/n} = G_a^k G_b^{n -k}\n$$\n\nTherefore, the AM-GM inequality gives:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\binom{n}{k}} \\sum_{|S|=k} \\prod_{i \\in S} a_i \\prod_{i \\notin S} b_i \\geq G_a^k G_b^{n -k}\n$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $\\binom{n}{k}$:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{|S|=k} \\prod_{i \\in S} a_i \\prod_{i \\notin S} b_i \\geq \\binom{n}{k} G_a^k G_b^{n -k}\n$$\n\nThus, each term in the expansion of the LHS is at least as large as the corresponding term in the binomial expansion of $(G_a + G_b)^n$. Therefore, summing over all k from 0 to n, we get:\n\n$$\n\\prod_{i=1}^n (a_i + b_i) \\geq \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} G_a^k G_b^{n -k} = (G_a + G_b)^n\n$$\n\nTaking the nth root of both sides gives the desired inequality:\n\n$$\n\\left( \\prod_{i=1}^n (a_i + b_i) \\right)^{1/n} \\geq G_a + G_b\n$$\n\nTherefore, the inequality holds, and equality occurs when equality holds in each AM-GM step. This happens when, for each k, all the terms $\\prod_{i \\in S} a_i \\prod_{i \\notin S} b_i$ are equal for all subsets S of size k. This condition implies that all the a_i's are equal and all the b_i's are equal. Specifically, if there exists constants a and b such that $a_i = a$ and $b_i = b$ for all i, then equality holds. More generally, equality holds when the ratio $a_i/b_i$ is constant for all i.\n\nThus, the inequality is proven using the AM-GM inequality applied to each subset of the product terms.",
