    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to format this problem from Math Stack Exchange according to the user's specified structure. Let me start by reading through the original question carefully.\n\nThe title of the question is: \"Prove $\\left|1+z_1\\right| +\\left|1+z_2\\right| + \\left|1+z_1z_2\\right|\\geq 2$\". The user is asking to prove this inequality for complex numbers $z_1$ and $z_2$. They mention that a similar question was solved where $|z_1|=|z_2|=1$, but in this case, they don't have that condition. They are unsure if the problem is missing the condition or if it's implicit. They also show their work using the triangle inequality but feel stuck.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The problem states that $z_1, z_2$ are complex numbers. The original similar problem had the condition that their magnitudes are 1. However, in this problem, that condition isn't stated. The user is confused about whether that's an oversight or if the condition is somehow implied. \n\nWait, the user is asking whether the problem is missing the condition or if it's implicit. But the way the problem is presented here doesn't include $|z_1|=|z_2|=1$, so the assumptions should only be what's explicitly given. However, maybe there's an implicit assumption here? Let's check the user's work.\n\nIn their attempt, they used the triangle inequality. Let's see their steps:\n\nThey started with $|1+z_1| + |1+z_2| + |1+z_1 z_2|$, then rewrote the last term as $|-(1 + z_1 z_2)|$ (which is the same as $|1 + z_1 z_2|$). Then they applied the triangle inequality in the form $|a| + |b| \\geq |a + b|$ but here they grouped the second and third terms: $|1+z_2| + |-(1 + z_1 z_2)| \\geq |(1+z_2) - (1 + z_1 z_2)| = |z_2 - z_1 z_2| = |z_2(1 - z_1)| = |z_2| |1 - z_1|$. Then they proceed to another inequality step, but maybe that's not helpful.\n\nHowever, the user is getting stuck here. In the similar question where $|z_1|=|z_2|=1$, the inequality holds. But without that condition, does the inequality still hold? Let me test some values. Suppose $z_1 = 0$ and $z_2 = 0$. Then the left-hand side becomes $|1+0| + |1+0| + |1+0*0| = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \\geq 2$, which works. What if $z_1 = 2$, $z_2 = 3$? Then $|3| + |4| + |7| = 3 + 4 + 7 = 14 \\geq 2$. So it's true here. What if $z_1 = -1$, $z_2 = -1$? Then $|0| + |0| + |1 + 1| = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2 \\geq 2$, which is exactly 2. Another case: $z_1 = 1$, $z_2 = -1$: $|2| + |0| + |1 -1| = 2 + 0 + 0 = 2 \\geq 2$. Hmm. So in these examples, the inequality holds.\n\nBut wait, is there a case where it doesn't hold? Let me try $z_1 = -2$, $z_2 = -2$. Then $|1 -2| + |1 -2| + |1 + 4| = 1 + 1 + 5 = 7 \\geq 2$. Still holds. Maybe even with larger magnitudes? Let me take $z_1 = 10$, $z_2 = 10$. Then $|11| + |11| + |1 + 100| = 11 + 11 + 101 = 123 \\geq 2$. So it seems like the inequality is always true regardless of the modulus of $z_1$ and $z_2$.\n\nBut wait, in the similar problem with $|z_1|=|z_2|=1$, the inequality is proved. So here, the problem is more general. However, in the original problem the user is solving, they don't have that modulus condition. So the assumptions here are only that $z_1$ and $z_2$ are complex numbers. But perhaps the problem as stated is incorrect? Wait, but the user's examples and my own tests show that it's true. Maybe the problem is correct as stated, even without the modulus condition.\n\nWait, but if $z_1$ and $z_2$ are real numbers, can we have a case where the sum is less than 2? Let's see. Let me take $z_1 = -1$ and $z_2 = -1$. Then, as before, sum is 2. If $z_1 = -0.5$, $z_2 = -0.5$: $|0.5| + |0.5| + |1 + 0.25| = 0.5 + 0.5 + 1.25 = 2.25 \\geq 2$. If $z_1 = -0.9$, $z_2 = -0.9$: |0.1| + |0.1| + |1 + 0.81| = 0.1 + 0.1 + 1.81 = 2.01 >= 2. Close. If $z_1$ approaches -1, $z_2$ approaches -1. Then the sum approaches 0 + 0 + |1 + 1| = 2. So equality is achieved here.\n\nBut if $z_1$ and $z_2$ are allowed to be any complex numbers, then the inequality seems to hold, perhaps with equality when $z_1 = z_2 = -1$, or when one is -1 and the other is arbitrary? Wait, let's check $z_1 = -1$, $z_2$ = any complex number. Then |1 + (-1)| = 0, |1 + z_2|, and |1 + (-1)z_2| = |1 - z_2|. So the sum becomes 0 + |1 + z_2| + |1 - z_2|. For any complex number z_2, |1 + z_2| + |1 - z_2| >= 2. Is that true? Let's take z_2 = 0: 1 + 1 = 2. z_2 = 1: |2| + |0| = 2. z_2 = i: |1 + i| + |1 - i| = sqrt(2) + sqrt(2) = 2sqrt(2) ≈ 2.828 >= 2. So yes, that sum is always at least 2. So even if one of the terms is zero, the other two sum to at least 2. So the original inequality seems to hold for any complex numbers z1 and z2.\n\nBut the user is confused because in the similar problem, the condition |z1| = |z2| = 1 is given. But in their problem, that condition is not present. So maybe the problem as stated is correct, and the answer is that the inequality holds for all complex numbers z1, z2. But the user's attempt uses the triangle inequality steps but isn't getting to the conclusion. Maybe they need a different approach, like using the fact that for any complex numbers a and b, |a| + |b| >= |a + b|, or other properties.\n\nBut for structuring the problem, the assumptions are simply that z1 and z2 are complex numbers, and the problem is to prove the inequality. The original problem didn't specify any modulus conditions, so the assumptions should not include |z1| = |z2| = 1 unless it's part of the problem, which it isn't. However, in the example given by the user in the \"Assumption\" part, they included \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem didn't mention that. Wait, looking back at the example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that's conflicting. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted version, they added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Unless the user made a mistake in their example. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect. Because if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", then the assumption should not restrict n to be divisible by 7. Unless the user intended to present a modified version. Maybe the example is wrong. But the user provided that example as how to structure, so perhaps they wanted to filter out redundant info. Wait, in the original problem, to prove divisibility by 91 (which is 7*13), maybe the problem requires n to be such that 5 and 6 are coprime to 7 and 13, but I'm not sure. However, if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", then the formatted assumption should not add \"n is divisible by 7\". That's conflicting. So perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user still wants us to follow the format. So in the current problem, the original question does not have the modulus condition, so the assumption is only that z1 and z2 are complex numbers. Therefore, the formatted problem should list the assumptions as z1 and z2 being complex numbers, each on a separate line. But in the example, the assumptions were \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\", even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". That seems like an error, but perhaps the user wants to extract all conditions, even if they are not explicitly stated. Wait, no. The user's instruction says: \"filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" So perhaps in the example, the original problem might have had a condition that n is divisible by 7, but in the example provided, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. Maybe there was a mistake in the example. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instruction.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question states: \"Let z_1,z_2 ∈ ℂ prove that |1+z1| + |1+z2| + |1+z1z2| ≥ 2\". So the assumptions are:\n\n1. z1 is a complex number.\n2. z2 is a complex number.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address only one property applied to one object. So each complex number is a separate assumption.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nz₁ is a complex number,\nz₂ is a complex number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that |1 + z₁| + |1 + z₂| + |1 + z₁z₂| ≥ 2.\n\nBut the user in their example added an extra condition (n divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect. Wait, in the original problem of the example: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n + 1) - 6^n(3^n + 2^n) is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems wrong, unless there was a misinterpretation. Because 91 = 7*13, and perhaps the original problem required n to satisfy some divisibility, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the formatted version's assumption is wrong. So maybe the example is incorrect, but the user wants us to follow the format. Therefore, in the current problem, we need to list all explicit assumptions. Since the problem states \"Let z₁, z₂ ∈ ℂ\", then the assumptions are z₁ and z₂ are complex numbers. The similar problem had |z₁|=|z₂|=1, but this one doesn't, so those aren't assumptions here.\n\nBut wait, the user is confused and asks if the question is wrong or if the condition is implicit. But according to the problem statement, there is no modulus condition. So in formatting the problem, we shouldn't include any modulus conditions unless they are in the original problem. Therefore, the formatted problem should have assumptions that z₁ and z₂ are complex numbers, and the problem is to prove the inequality.\n\nSo the final answer should be:\n\nAssumption:\nz₁ is a complex number,\nz₂ is a complex number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that |1 + z₁| + |1 + z₂| + |1 + z₁z₂| ≥ 2.",
