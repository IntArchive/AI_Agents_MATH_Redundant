    "Content": "In an answer to another question I used the fact that $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_m)\\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_n)$ if and only if $m$ divides $n$ (here $\\zeta_n$ stands for a primitive $n$th root of unity, Edit: and neither $m$ nor $n$ is  twice an odd number; see KCd comments below). More generally, one can show that $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_n)\\cap \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_m)=\\mathbb{Q}$ when $\\gcd(n,m)=1$. The only proof of this fact that comes to mind uses facts about discriminants of cyclotomic extensions, and the fact that every non-trivial number field extension over $\\mathbb{Q}$ ramifies at least at one prime (see, for instance, Washington, \"Introduction to Cyclotomic Fields\", Chapter 2, Proposition 2.4). Since the original question that I was trying to answer was somewhat elementary, I was left wondering if there are more elementary proofs of the fact \n$$\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_n)\\cap \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_m)=\\mathbb{Q}, \\text{ when } \\gcd(n,m)=1. $$ \nBy \"elementary proof\" here I mean some proof that does not involve algebraic number theory results about discriminants, or ramification of primes in rings of integers of number fields. Can anyone think of an elementary proof? Thanks!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "$\\newcommand{\\Q}{\\mathbf Q}$This answer assumes that we're willing to use $[\\Q(\\zeta_n) : \\Q] = \\varphi(n)$, which is not obvious. A freely available reference is Milne's notes , Lemma 5.9 and Theorem 5.10. Since $n$ and $m$ are coprime, the proof you gave shows that $\\mathbf Q(\\zeta_{nm}) = \\mathbf Q(\\zeta_n, \\zeta_m)$, and the totient function satisfies $\\varphi(nm) = \\varphi(n)\\varphi(m)$.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to extract assumptions and the problem statement from the Math Stack Exchange question provided.\n\nFirst, the original question is about proving that the intersection of the cyclotomic fields Q(ζₙ) and Q(ζₘ) is Q when gcd(n,m) = 1. They also mention that the existing proof uses discriminants and ramification, but they want an elementary proof without algebraic number theory.\n\nSo, I need to list all the assumptions. Let's parse through the question:\n\n1. The fields involved are cyclotomic fields: Q(ζₙ) and Q(ζₘ). ζₙ and ζₘ are primitive nth and mth roots of unity, respectively.\n2. The gcd(n, m) = 1. That's a key condition.\n3. The original answer mentions that neither m nor n is twice an odd number (from KCd's comments). Wait, the user edited to include that condition. So that's another assumption. But the problem statement in the question is more general, asking for when gcd(n,m)=1. However, in the example given in the answer, they had to exclude cases where m or n is twice an odd number. Wait, perhaps in the general problem, the exclusion is part of the assumptions?\n\nWait, the user says: \"In an answer to another question I used the fact that Q(ζₘ)⊆Q(ζₙ) if and only if m divides n (here ζₙ stands for a primitive nth root of unity, Edit: and neither m nor n is twice an odd number; see KCd comments below).\" So the original fact had an exclusion, but the problem they're posing is more general: \"More generally, one can show that Q(ζₙ)∩Q(ζₘ)=Q when gcd(n,m)=1.\" However, in the edited part, they mention that the initial fact (the inclusion) requires that neither m nor n is twice an odd number, but the problem they want to solve is the intersection being Q when gcd(n,m)=1. So do we need to include that exclusion here?\n\nWait, the problem as stated in the question is to prove Q(ζₙ) ∩ Q(ζₘ) = Q when gcd(n,m)=1. The user is asking for an elementary proof of this. But in the original answer (which they referenced), they had an edit saying that the inclusion Q(ζₘ)⊆Q(ζₙ) requires that neither m nor n is twice an odd number. But does that affect the intersection problem?\n\nWait, perhaps in the general case where gcd(n,m)=1, the intersection is Q, regardless of whether n or m is twice an odd number. But maybe there are exceptions? Wait, the problem as stated by the user doesn't mention any exceptions. But in their original inclusion fact, they had to exclude the twice odd case, but the intersection problem might not require that. So perhaps the problem as posed by the user assumes gcd(n,m)=1 and that's it. But the answer might have some conditions. Wait, the user is asking to structure the problem as per the example. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the formatted problem, they included that as an assumption. So in this case, the user's problem is to prove Q(ζₙ) ∩ Q(ζₘ) = Q when gcd(n,m)=1. The user also mentions that in the inclusion case (Q(ζₘ) ⊆ Q(ζₙ) iff m divides n), there was an edit that neither m nor n is twice an odd number. But for the intersection problem, the user does not mention any such exception. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions for the intersection problem are:\n\n- ζₙ is a primitive nth root of unity.\n- ζₘ is a primitive mth root of unity.\n- gcd(n, m) = 1.\n\nBut wait, the user's problem is about Q(ζₙ) ∩ Q(ζₘ) = Q. So the problem is under the assumption that gcd(n,m)=1. However, the user's own statement says \"when gcd(n,m)=1\" which is part of the problem statement, but in their inclusion example, they had to add that neither m nor n is twice an odd number. But in the problem they're posing, do they require any such exclusion? The user doesn't mention any such exclusion in their problem statement. So perhaps the answer is that the only assumptions are gcd(n,m)=1 and ζₙ, ζₘ are primitive roots. But maybe the actual theorem requires that n and m are not twice an odd number? Wait, let me think. For example, if n=2 and m=3, gcd(2,3)=1, then Q(ζ₂)=Q(-1)=Q, and Q(ζ₃) is a quadratic field. Wait, no: ζ₂ is -1, so Q(ζ₂)=Q, and Q(ζ₃) is a quadratic field? No, ζ₃ is a primitive 3rd root, which has degree φ(3)=2 over Q. So their intersection would be Q ∩ Q(ζ₃) = Q. So that's okay. But if n=4 and m=3, then Q(ζ₄)=Q(i), Q(ζ₃) is Q(√-3), their intersection is Q. So that works. What if n=6 and m=10? Wait, gcd(6,10)=2, which is not 1, so that's not applicable. Wait, but suppose n=2 and m=6. Then gcd(2,6)=2≠1. So the case where gcd=1 is safe. Wait, perhaps the problem as stated is correct without the twice-odd condition, but in the inclusion case, they needed that. So for the intersection problem, the assumptions are just gcd(n,m)=1 and ζₙ, ζₘ are primitive roots. So the formatted problem should list assumptions as:\n\nAssumption:\nζₙ is a primitive nth root of unity,\nζₘ is a primitive mth root of unity,\ngcd(n, m) = 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that ℚ(ζₙ) ∩ ℚ(ζₘ) = ℚ.\n\nBut wait, the user mentions that in the inclusion case (if and only if m divides n), they had to exclude cases where m or n is twice an odd number. But in the intersection problem, maybe that exclusion isn't necessary. The user is asking about the intersection when gcd(n,m)=1. So perhaps the assumptions are just the three listed above. The problem as stated by the user is \"Prove that [...] when gcd(n,m)=1\", so the primary assumption is gcd(n,m)=1. The other assumptions are that ζₙ and ζₘ are primitive roots. So that's three assumptions. Then the problem is to prove the intersection is Q. That should be correct.",
