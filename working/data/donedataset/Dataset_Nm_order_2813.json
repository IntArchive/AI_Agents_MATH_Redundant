    "Content": "I'm having trouble trying to solve this problem. Let $f \\in \\Bbb Z[x]$ such that there exist $a$, $b$, $c$ (all different) and $$f(a)=f(b)=f(c)=1.$$ Prove that there is no $d \\in \\Bbb Z$ such that $f(d)=0$. I'm practicing for an exam. I've tried setting a polynomial $g(x)=f(x)-1$ and factoring it as if it had three roots, but then I do not know how to continue. Any suggestions?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You were in the right path, the idea is that if you have three distinct numbers in $\\mathbb{Z}$ one must be different from $\\pm1$. Take $g(x)$ as you have defined and assume there is $d$ such that $f(d)=0$, then $$(d-a)(d-b)(d-c)\\tilde{g}(d)=-1$$ A contradiction since $d-a,d-b,d-c$ are distinct.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to help structure this problem from Math Stack Exchange. Let me read through it again. The user is talking about a polynomial f in integers[x], meaning the coefficients are integers. There are three distinct integers a, b, c where f(a)=f(b)=f(c)=1. They need to prove that there's no integer d such that f(d)=0. The user tried setting g(x) = f(x) -1, which makes sense because then g(a)=g(b)=g(c)=0, so g has factors (x-a)(x-b)(x-c). Since f is in Z[x], g would also be in Z[x], so this factorization should hold. But then how does that lead to the conclusion that f can't have a root d in integers?\n\nLet me think. If g(x) = (x-a)(x-b)(x-c)h(x), where h(x) is another polynomial with integer coefficients. Then f(x) = (x-a)(x-b)(x-c)h(x) +1. Suppose there exists an integer d such that f(d)=0. Then (d-a)(d-b)(d-c)h(d) +1 =0, which implies (d-a)(d-b)(d-c)h(d) = -1. Now, since d, a, b, c are integers, each term (d-a), (d-b), (d-c) is an integer, and h(d) is also an integer. The product of these terms is -1. The only divisors of -1 in integers are 1 and -1. Therefore, each of the factors (d-a), (d-b), (d-c), and h(d) must be either 1 or -1. But there are three linear factors and h(d), so maybe there's a contradiction here because three factors multiplied together can't all be 1 or -1 unless they are arranged in a certain way. But since a, b, c are distinct, d can't be equal to any of them, so each (d-a), (d-b), (d-c) is non-zero. However, the product of three integers (each ±1) would be ±1, and then multiplied by h(d) to get -1. So h(d) must be either -1 or 1, but then the product of the three linear terms would have to be -1 or 1. Wait, but if h(d) is ±1, then (d-a)(d-b)(d-c) must be ∓1. However, (d-a), (d-b), (d-c) are three distinct integers because a, b, c are distinct. So we have three distinct integers whose product is ±1. The only way three distinct integers multiply to ±1 is if two of them are 1 and -1, but then the third would have to be ±1 as well, but that would contradict the distinctness. For example, suppose (d-a)=1, (d-b)=-1, then (d-c) would have to be either 1 or -1 to make the product 1 or -1, but then (d-c) would equal 1 or -1, which would imply that c is either d-1 or d+1. But if a, b, c are all distinct, and d is different from a, b, c, then perhaps this leads to a contradiction? Wait, but maybe d is not distinct from them. Wait, no, because if d were equal to a, then (d-a)=0, but f(d)=0, but f(a)=1, so d can't be a. Similarly, d can't be b or c. Therefore, d is distinct from a, b, c. So the three factors (d-a), (d-b), (d-c) are three distinct non-zero integers. Their product is ±1, which would require each of them to be ±1. But three distinct integers each being 1 or -1? The possible combinations are limited. Let's see: 1, -1, 1: product is -1, but two of them are same. Similarly, 1, -1, -1: product is 1, but two same. To have all three distinct, but each is 1 or -1: impossible, because there are only two possible values. Therefore, there are no three distinct integers each of which is 1 or -1. Hence, the product cannot be ±1, which leads to a contradiction. Therefore, our assumption that such a d exists is false. Therefore, there is no integer d with f(d)=0.\n\nSo the key assumptions here are that f is a polynomial with integer coefficients, there are three distinct integers a, b, c where f evaluates to 1, and we need to show no integer root exists. The critical step is factoring f(x)-1 as (x-a)(x-b)(x-c)h(x) and then analyzing the possible divisors of -1. Since three distinct integers can't multiply to ±1 without repetition, contradiction arises. Therefore, the problem's assumptions are:\n\n- f is in Z[x] (integer coefficients)\n- There exist distinct integers a, b, c\n- f(a) = f(b) = f(c) = 1\n- Need to prove no integer d exists with f(d)=0.\n\nEach assumption is separate. The user had mentioned setting g(x)=f(x)-1, which factors into (x-a)(x-b)(x-c)h(x), then supposing f(d)=0 leads to (d-a)(d-b)(d-c)h(d)=-1. Since the product of three distinct integers (d-a, d-b, d-c) would have to be ±1, but that's impossible as three distinct integers can't each be ±1. So the assumptions are correctly listed as f being integer polynomial, existence of three distinct a,b,c with f(a)=f(b)=f(c)=1, and the problem is to show no integer root d exists.",
