    "Content": "I'm looking to prove that any $k$-regular graph $G$ (i.e. a graph with degree $k$ for all vertices) with an odd number of points has edge-colouring number $>k$ ($\\chi'(G) > k$). With Vizing, I see that $\\chi'(G) \\leq k + 1$, so apparently $\\chi'(G)$ will end up equaling $k+1$. Furthermore, as $\\#V$ is odd, $k$ must be even for $\\#V\\cdot k$ to be an even number (required to be even, since $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\#V\\cdot k =   \\#E$. Does anyone have any suggestions on what to try?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $G=\\langle V,E\\rangle$ be a $k$-regular graph with $n=2m+1$ vertices; as you say, clearly $k=2\\ell$ for some $\\ell$, so $G$ has $$\\frac{kn}2=\\frac{2\\ell(2m+1)}2=\\ell(2m+1)$$ edges. Suppose that $c:E\\to\\{1,\\dots,k\\}$ is a coloring of the edges of $G$. $$\\frac{\\ell(2m+1)}k=m+\\frac12\\;,$$ so there is some color that is used on at least $m+1$ edges. $G$ has only $2m+1$ vertices, so two of these edges must share a vertex, and $c$ therefore cannot be a proper coloring.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this question. The user wants to prove that any k-regular graph with an odd number of vertices has an edge-coloring number greater than k. So, χ'(G) > k. They mentioned Vizing's theorem, which says that the edge chromatic number is either k or k+1. So, if they can show it can't be k, then it must be k+1. \n\nThe problem mentions that since the number of vertices is odd, k must be even. Because the total degree is #V * k, which equals twice the number of edges (since each edge is counted twice). So, #V * k must be even. If #V is odd, then k must be even to make the product even. That makes sense.\n\nSo the assumptions here are: G is a k-regular graph, the number of vertices in G is odd, and from that, k is even. But the problem doesn't explicitly state that k is even; that's a derived condition. However, in the original problem, the user points out that k must be even because #V is odd, so maybe that's part of the given conditions. Wait, the original problem says \"any k-regular graph G with an odd number of points\". So the main assumptions are k-regular and #V is odd. The fact that k must be even is a consequence of those two, so maybe that's not an assumption but a derived property.\n\nSo when structuring the problem, the assumptions should be the given conditions. The problem states that G is k-regular and #V is odd. Therefore, those are the two assumptions. The fact that k is even comes from the parity requirement for the total degree (since total degree is #V * k, which must be even because it's twice the number of edges). Since #V is odd, k must be even. So that's a conclusion, not an assumption. Therefore, the assumptions to list would be:\n\n- G is a k-regular graph.\n- The number of vertices in G is odd.\n\nThe problem is to prove that the edge-coloring number χ'(G) is greater than k. So, putting that together, the formatted problem should list those two assumptions and then the problem statement.\n\nThe user's example included derived conditions as assumptions, but in their example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the example, the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect? Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the example given by the user:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: \nn is an integer,\nn is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Because the original problem doesn't restrict n to be divisible by 7. Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Because 91 is 7*13, perhaps the original problem might have required n to be such that the expression is divisible by 91 for all integers n, but perhaps the user's example incorrectly added the assumption. Hmm, maybe the example is wrong. But the user is providing that example to show the format, so perhaps they intended that sometimes assumptions are derived from the problem's conditions.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user's original question is about a k-regular graph with an odd number of vertices. The problem's assumptions are that it's k-regular and that #V is odd. The fact that k is even is a consequence of those, not an assumption. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumptions should only be:\n\n- G is a k-regular graph.\n- The number of vertices in G is odd.\n\nProblem: Prove that the edge-coloring number χ'(G) is greater than k.\n\nSo, the user's example might have had a mistake, but following the instructions, we need to list the assumptions as given in the original problem, filtering out unrelated information. The original problem states \"any k-regular graph G (i.e., all vertices have degree k) with an odd number of points...\", so the two conditions are k-regular and odd number of vertices. The part about k being even is derived from those two, so it's not an assumption but a conclusion, hence not listed.\n\nWait, but in the user's example, they included \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, even though the original problem says \"for every integer n\". That seems contradictory. Maybe the example was incorrect, but the user expects to follow that structure. However, the user's instruction says: \"filter the unrelated information and structure the problem as the format\". So perhaps in the original problem, if there are some hidden assumptions or necessary conditions, they should be listed. But in the current problem, the necessary conditions given are k-regular and odd vertices. The fact that k must be even is a derived condition, not an assumption. So perhaps in the formatted problem, the assumptions should only be the ones explicitly given in the problem statement. Therefore, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", which may not be correct. That might have been a mistake.\n\nBut to follow the user's example, perhaps even if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. But that would be changing the problem. Maybe the example was a bad example, but since the user provided it, perhaps they want to extract the key assumptions, even if they are derived. Wait, in the example, the problem is to prove divisibility by 91, which is 7*13. The expression might be divisible by 91 for all integers n, but maybe the user in the example mistakenly thought that n needs to be divisible by 7. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem had a typo and required n to be divisible by 7, but the example was miswritten. Either way, following the current problem's instructions, the task is to read the Math Stack Exchange question, filter unrelated information, and structure the problem with assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's question states: \"any k-regular graph G (i.e. a graph with degree k for all vertices) with an odd number of points has edge-colouring number >k\". So the assumptions are:\n\n1. G is a k-regular graph.\n2. The number of vertices in G is odd.\n\nThese are the given conditions. The fact that k is even is derived from these two, but it's not an assumption. The problem is to prove χ'(G) > k.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a k-regular graph,\nThe number of vertices in G is odd.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the edge-coloring number χ'(G) is greater than k.",
