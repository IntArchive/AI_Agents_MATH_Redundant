    "Content": "Assume that $A$ is an $n\\times n$ skew-symmetric real matrix, i.e.\n$$A^T=-A.$$ Since $\\det(A-\\lambda I)=\\det(A^T-\\lambda I)$, $A$ and $A^T$ have the same eigenvalues. On the other hand, $A^T$ and $-A$ also have the same eigenvalues. Thus if $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $A$, so is $-\\lambda$. If $n$ is odd, $\\lambda = 0 $ is an eigenvalue. A curious search in Google returns that the nonzero eigenvalues of $A$ are all pure imaginary and thus are of the form $iλ_1, −iλ_1, iλ_2, −iλ_2,$ … where each of the $λ_k$ are real. Here is my question : How can I prove the fact that \"the nonzero eigenvalues of $A$ are all pure imaginary\"?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Consider $A$ as a matrix over $\\mathbb{C}$. Then we have that for all $\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y}\\in\\mathbb{C}^n$,\n$$\\langle A\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y} \\rangle = \\langle \\mathbf{x},A^*\\mathbf{y}\\rangle,$$\nwhere $\\langle-,-\\rangle$ is the standard complex inner product, and $A^*$ is the adjoint (which relative to the standard complex inner product is given by the conjugate transpose of $A$). Since $A$ is a real matrix, the adjoint is equal to the transpose, so for every $\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y}\\in\\mathbb{C}^n$, you have\n$$\\langle A\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y}\\rangle = \\langle \\mathbf{x},A^T\\mathbf{y}\\rangle = \\langle \\mathbf{x},-A\\mathbf{y}\\rangle = -\\langle \\mathbf{x},A\\mathbf{y}\\rangle.$$ Now suppose that $\\mathbf{x}$ is an eigenvector with eigenvalue $\\lambda$. Setting $\\mathbf{y}=\\mathbf{x}$, we have\n$$\\langle A\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{x}\\rangle = \\langle \\lambda\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{x}\\rangle = \\lambda \\lVert\\mathbf{x}\\rVert^2.$$\nOn the other hand,\n$$-\\langle \\mathbf{x},A\\mathbf{x}\\rangle = -\\langle\\mathbf{x},\\lambda\\mathbf{x}\\rangle = -\\overline{\\lambda}\\langle\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{x}\\rangle = -\\overline{\\lambda}\\lVert\\mathbf{x}\\rVert^2.$$\nThese two are equal, and since $\\mathbf{x}$ is an eigenvector, then $\\lVert\\mathbf{x}\\rVert\\neq 0$. Therefore, we have that $\\lambda=-\\overline{\\lambda}$, and hence $\\lambda$ is either $0$ or a pure imaginary number.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to structure this problem according to the user's format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions listed in the original question. The user wants each assumption to address only one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nLooking at the original problem: The user mentions that A is an n×n skew-symmetric real matrix, so that's one assumption. Then, there's the definition of skew-symmetric: A^T = -A. Wait, actually, the original problem states that A is skew-symmetric, so the equation A^T = -A is part of the definition. Should that be considered a separate assumption? Or is the main assumption just that A is a skew-symmetric real matrix?\n\nThe problem statement starts with \"Assume that A is an n×n skew-symmetric real matrix, i.e., A^T = -A.\" So maybe the main assumption is that A is skew-symmetric real matrix, and the equation A^T = -A is part of that definition. So perhaps the first assumption is \"A is an n×n real matrix,\" and the second is \"A is skew-symmetric (i.e., A^T = -A).\" Wait, but the problem might not require n to be specified as even or odd unless necessary. However, the user later mentions that if n is odd, then 0 is an eigenvalue, but the current problem is about nonzero eigenvalues. So maybe the assumptions should include that A is a real skew-symmetric matrix of any size n×n. Let me check the example given.\n\nIn the example provided, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. The formatted problem separated these into two assumptions. So each property or condition on one object per line.\n\nIn this case, the problem states A is an n×n skew-symmetric real matrix. So the first assumption is that A is an n×n real matrix. Second assumption is that A is skew-symmetric (A^T = -A). The problem is to prove that all nonzero eigenvalues of A are pure imaginary. The user also mentions in the problem statement some steps they've considered, but those might not be necessary for the assumptions. The task is to filter out the unrelated information.\n\nThe original question's problem is: \"How can I prove the fact that 'the nonzero eigenvalues of A are all pure imaginary'?\" So the assumptions needed are the ones given in the problem setup. The user mentions that n is odd leads to 0 being an eigenvalue, but the problem is about nonzero eigenvalues, so maybe n can be any size, even or odd. So the key assumptions are that A is a real skew-symmetric matrix, i.e., real and satisfies A^T = -A. So two assumptions: A is an n×n real matrix, and A is skew-symmetric (A^T = -A). The problem is to prove that all nonzero eigenvalues of A are pure imaginary.\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem had the assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So each assumption is on its own line, even if they apply to the same object. Here, the matrix A is real and skew-symmetric. So perhaps two separate assumptions: \"A is an n×n real matrix\" and \"A is skew-symmetric (i.e., A^T = -A).\" Then the problem is to prove the nonzero eigenvalues are pure imaginary.\n\nThe user's original question also mentions that they know eigenvalues come in ±λ pairs, but that's part of the reasoning, not the problem's assumptions. So in the formatted problem, we should only list the given assumptions, not the intermediate steps or known properties.\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n- A is an n×n real matrix.\n- A is skew-symmetric (i.e., A^T = -A).\n\nProblem: Prove that all nonzero eigenvalues of A are pure imaginary.\n\nWait, but does the problem require any other assumptions? For instance, that we're considering complex eigenvalues? Because real skew-symmetric matrices have eigenvalues that are either 0 or purely imaginary, but since they're real matrices, their complex eigenvalues come in conjugate pairs. But the problem is about proving that the nonzero ones are purely imaginary, so maybe that's covered by the properties of the matrix. So the key assumptions are just that A is a real skew-symmetric matrix. The problem is to show the eigenvalues are purely imaginary.\n\nYes, that seems right. So structuring the problem accordingly.",
