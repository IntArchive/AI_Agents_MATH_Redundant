    "Content": "So the following comes to me from an old algebraic topology final that got the best of me.  I wasn't able to prove it due to a lack of technical confidence, and my topology has only deteriorated since then.  But, I'm hoping maybe someone can figure out the proof as I've always been interested in seeing it all at once! Let $E_\\infty$ denote the 2-D analogue of the Hawaiian Earring, i.e. $$E_\\infty = \\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty \\{(x,y,z) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 | \\hspace{2mm} (x-1/n)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1/n^2\\}.$$ The object of the exercise is to show that even though $E_\\infty$ is 2-dimensional, $H_3(E_\\infty) \\neq 0$ , which I find interesting even though I know it's not a CW-complex. Parts of the proof were helped along by my professor to serve as a road map for the solution, but sadly I'm still lost in the driveway filling in some of the remaining bits: Let $h: S^3 \\longrightarrow S^2$ denote the Hopf map i.e. the attaching map for the 4-cell in $\\mathbb{C}P^2$ .  One can readily observe that there is a continuous map $\\tilde{h}: S^3 \\longrightarrow E_\\infty$ so that the projection of $\\tilde{h}$ to any $S^2$ in $E_\\infty$ is homotopic to the Hopf map. Let $C_\\tilde{h}$ denote the mapping cone of $\\tilde{h}$ .  Then we have a mapping cones that looks something like a LOT of $\\mathbb{C}P^2$ 's. (1) First we must prove that $H^2(C_\\tilde{h})$ contains a subgroup $\\mathbb{Z}<\\zeta_1, \\zeta_2, ...>$ and $H^4(C_\\tilde{h}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}<\\eta>$ where $$\\zeta_i \\cup \\zeta_i = \\eta \\text{ and } \\zeta_i \\cup \\zeta_j = 0 \\text{ for } i \\neq j.$$ (I suspect that this comes in part from the cup product structure on $\\mathbb{C}P^2$ ). Now let $[S^3]$ denote the fundamental class of $S^3$ . Assumption: Suppose that $\\tilde{h}_* = 0 \\in H_3(E_\\infty)$ .  Under this assumption, there is a finite simplicial complex $X$ with boundary $S^3$ so that $\\tilde{h}$ extends to a map $k: X \\longrightarrow E_\\infty$ .  Let $Y = X \\cup \\mathbb{D}^4$ where $\\mathbb{D}^4$ is glued to $S^3$ in the obvious way.  Then extending $k$ , we have another map $l: Y \\longrightarrow C_\\tilde{h}$ sending the $B^4$ to the cone $S^3 \\times [0,1]/ S^3 \\times 1$ . (2) Here it must be proven that $l^*(\\eta)$ is a nontrivial element of $H^4(Y)$ . (I truly do not see how to do this, but it seems like it would be true [here \"seems\" doesn't really mean anything]). (3) And now it needs to be shown that the infinitely many $l^*(\\zeta_i)$ are all linearly independent. (This would seem to follow from naturality of the cup product in some way). If I could prove these things, it would only remain to observe that $Y$ came from gluing to a finite simplicial complex, and therefore it is itself a finite simplicial complex.  Hence $H^2(Y)$ is finitely generated, so we arrive at the desired contradiction, which is awesome since we have found a nontrivial element in the third homology group of a 2-D object!  Awesome! Anyways, if anyone could complete this proof in its entirety, I would be supremely grateful.  I assure you that I will upvote it a hundred times over! Even though the last 99 won't really do much. Also sorry that there are sort of several questions embedded in one.  I thought it would be justified as they lie in the same vein of the single proof.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "$\\newcommand{\\Ch}{ C_{\\tilde h}}\n\\newcommand{\\CP}{\\mathbb{CP}^2}$\nWe will make use of natural inclusions $\\alpha_i\\colon S^2\\hookrightarrow C_{\\tilde h}$ and natural projections $\\pi_j\\colon \\Ch\\to \\CP$. The composition $\\pi_j\\circ \\alpha_j$ is the standard inclusion of $S^2$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ and the compositions $\\pi_j\\circ\\alpha_i$ are the constant map to the base point when $i\\neq j$. The composition on the level of $H^2$ is the identity, giving that $\\pi_i^*(\\zeta)=:\\zeta_i$ are all nonzero. (We let $\\zeta$ be a generator of $H^2(\\CP)$.) In fact, we want to show they are linearly independent. This follows from the fact that the homology-cohomology pairing satisfies $\\langle \\pi_i^*(\\zeta),(\\alpha_j)_*([S^2])\\rangle =\\delta_{ij}$. To continue, I'm going to cheat slightly and assume that $H^4(E_\\infty)=H^5(E_\\infty)=0$, since otherwise we would have a higher dimensional class, which would be equally surprising as a $3$ dimensional one.\nIn that case, by the long exact sequence of the pair $$\\mathbb Z\\cong H^4(\\Ch,E_\\infty)\\cong H^4(\\Ch).$$  Note that the generator of $H^4(\\Ch,E_\\infty)$ is dual to the $4$-cell as is the image of $\\zeta^2\\in H^4(\\CP)$. Thus if we let $\\eta$ denote the generator of $H^4(\\Ch)$ we have $\\zeta_i^2=\\eta$ for all $i$. Furthermore $\\zeta_i\\zeta_j=0$ for $i\\neq j$ because they are disjointly supported. The image $\\ell^*(\\eta)$ is nonzero as it is dual to the $4$-cell, but $Y$  by construction represents a $4$-cycle on which $\\ell^*(\\eta)$ evaluates nontrivially. To see that $\\ell^*(\\zeta_i)$ are linearly independent, suppose that $\\sum_{i\\in I} n_i\\ell^*(\\zeta_i)=0$. Now take the cup product of this element with itself! We have $$\\sum_{i\\in I}\\sum_{j\\in I} n_in_j\\ell^*(\\zeta_i\\zeta_j)=\\sum_{i\\in I} n_i^2\\ell^*(\\eta)=0,$$ implying $\\sum n_i^2=0$ and so $n_i=0$ for all $i$. This contradicts the finite generation of $H^4(Y)$ and we are done!",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to help structure this problem according to the user's specified format. Let me start by reading through the original problem carefully to understand what's being asked and identify the key assumptions and components.\n\nThe problem is about algebraic topology, specifically involving the homology of an infinite wedge of spheres called E_∞. The main goal is to show that H₃(E_∞) ≠ 0 even though E_∞ is 2-dimensional. The user mentions parts (1), (2), and (3) that need to be proven as steps towards this contradiction.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the problem and extract all the assumptions. The user provided an example where assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let me go through the problem step by step.\n\nThe problem starts by defining E_∞ as the 2-D analogue of the Hawaiian Earring, which is an infinite union of spheres. The objective is to show that the third homology group H₃(E_∞) is non-zero. The user refers to parts (1), (2), and (3) which are specific steps in the proof.\n\nLooking at the given information:\n\n- There's a Hopf map h: S³ → S², and a map ȟ: S³ → E_∞ such that the projection to any S² in E_∞ is homotopic to the Hopf map.\n- The mapping cone C_ȟ is considered, and part (1) involves proving properties about its cohomology groups H² and H⁴, specifically that H² has a subgroup generated by ζ₁, ζ₂,... and H⁴ is isomorphic to ℤ with generator η, with certain cup product structures.\n- Assumption: ȟ_* = 0 in H₃(E_∞). Under this assumption, there's a finite simplicial complex X with boundary S³ so that ȟ extends to a map k: X → E_∞. Then Y is formed by gluing a 4-disk D⁴ to X, leading to a map l: Y → C_ȟ.\n- Part (2) requires proving that l*(η) is nontrivial in H⁴(Y).\n- Part (3) needs to show the l*(ζ_i) are linearly independent.\n- The conclusion would be a contradiction since Y is a finite simplicial complex, implying H²(Y) is finitely generated, conflicting with the infinitely many ζ_i's.\n\nNow, extracting assumptions:\n\nFrom the problem statement, the explicit assumptions given are:\n\n1. E_∞ is the 2-dimensional Hawaiian Earring analogue (defined as the union of spheres).\n2. The Hopf map h: S³ → S² exists.\n3. There exists a continuous map ȟ: S³ → E_∞ such that the projection to any S² in E_∞ is homotopic to h.\n4. C_ȟ is the mapping cone of ȟ.\n5. Assumption: ȟ_* = 0 in H₃(E_∞).\n6. Under this assumption, X is a finite simplicial complex with boundary S³, and ȟ extends to k: X → E_∞.\n7. Y is constructed as X ∪ D⁴ with D⁴ glued to S³, leading to map l: Y → C_ȟ.\n\nEach of these should be listed as separate assumptions. However, the user's example included assumptions that are conditions applied to the problem, so I need to list each assumption line by line. Some of these might be part of the problem setup rather than assumptions, so I need to discern which are given conditions and which are to be proven.\n\nThe key assumptions here are:\n\n- The existence of the map ȟ with the specified property.\n- The structure of C_ȟ.\n- The assumption that ȟ_* is zero in H₃(E_∞).\n- The construction of X, Y, and the maps k and l.\n\nAdditionally, the problem asks to prove three parts (1), (2), (3), but in the required format, the \"Problem\" section should encapsulate the main task. However, the original problem's main goal is to show H₃(E_∞) ≠ 0, and the parts (1)-(3) are steps towards that. So the main problem is to show H₃(E_∞) ≠ 0, using those steps.\n\nBut in the example given by the user, the formatted problem focused on the specific divisibility, even though the original problem had multiple parts. So perhaps here, the main problem is the overall goal, and the parts (1)-(3) are sub-problems. However, the user's instructions say to structure the problem according to the format, which in the example extracted the key problem and assumptions.\n\nIn the example, the user had an original problem that mentioned proving a number is divisible by 91, but the formatted problem listed assumptions and the problem. Here, the original problem's main question is to show H₃(E_∞) ≠ 0, but the user's problem as presented in the question includes several parts (1)-(3) that need to be proven as part of the process. However, according to the user's example, perhaps we should list all the assumptions given in the problem (including those that are part of the setup) and then state the problem as the main task.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91, and the formatted problem listed the assumptions (n is integer, n is divisible by 7) and then the problem. However, in that example, the user had an incorrect assumption (n divisible by 7) which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, actually, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted example, an extra assumption \"n is divisible by 7\" was added. Wait, that seems like a mistake. But according to the user's example, perhaps the assumptions are the given conditions, not added ones. Wait, no. Looking back:\n\nThe original problem in the example was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Then the problem is to prove A(n) divisible by 91. But that seems incorrect, since the original problem's assumption was for every integer n, not n divisible by 7. Maybe there was a mistake in the example? Wait, perhaps the user provided an example where they filtered out unrelated information, but perhaps in that case, maybe the original problem actually had n divisible by 7 as an assumption. But as presented, the user's example seems to have added an assumption not present in the original problem. That suggests that perhaps the user's example is incorrect, but we need to follow their format regardless.\n\nBut perhaps in that example, the user mistakenly added the \"n is divisible by 7\" assumption. However, regardless, the task is to follow the format as per the user's instruction. So, for the current problem, we need to list all the assumptions given in the problem, each as a separate line, addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nLooking back at the current problem:\n\nThe problem mentions:\n\n- E_∞ is the 2-D Hawaiian Earring.\n- There's a Hopf map h: S³ → S².\n- There's a map ȟ: S³ → E_∞ such that projections to any S² in E_∞ are homotopic to h.\n- The mapping cone C_ȟ is considered.\n- Assumption: ȟ_* = 0 in H₃(E_∞).\n- Under this assumption, X is a finite simplicial complex with boundary S³, extending ȟ to k: X → E_∞.\n- Y is constructed as X ∪ D⁴, leading to map l: Y → C_ȟ.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. Additionally, the problem refers to parts (1), (2), (3) to prove, which are steps in the proof. However, the user wants the formatted problem to state the main problem, which in this case is to show that H₃(E_∞) ≠ 0, using these steps. However, the original problem's explicit question is in the title: \"Algebraic Topology Challenge: Homology of an Infinite Wedge of Spheres\" and the content says \"the object of the exercise is to show that [...] H₃(E_∞) ≠ 0 [...]\". So the main problem is to show H₃(E_∞) ≠ 0, with the parts (1)-(3) being parts of the proof.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the formatted problem should state the problem as given, filtering out unrelated info. So perhaps the formatted problem here would have the main problem as \"Prove that H₃(E_∞) ≠ 0\" with the assumptions listed as the given conditions.\n\nBut the problem as presented in the user's input includes several parts (1), (2), (3) to be proven as part of the solution. However, the user's example didn't include such sub-problems but focused on the main problem. The user's instruction says to structure the problem as per the format, which includes listing assumptions and stating the problem. So perhaps in this case, the problem is the main task, which is to show H₃(E_∞) ≠ 0, and the parts (1)-(3) are steps towards it, but the formatted problem would just encapsulate the main problem. However, the user's original problem includes multiple embedded questions, but the example shows that the formatted problem is the main problem. Alternatively, if the problem is presented as multiple parts, but the user's format requires a single problem statement, we need to reconcile this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem as formatted should include all the parts (1)-(3) as the problem, given that the user mentions \"several questions embedded in one\". But the example provided by the user took the main problem. However, in the example, the original problem was a single statement, while here, the problem has multiple parts. The user says \"they lie in the same vein of the single proof\", so perhaps the formatted problem should state all three parts as the problem. However, the example format has a single problem statement.\n\nGiven that the user's example includes the main problem and the formatted problem as the main statement, even if the original problem has parts, perhaps here we need to structure the problem as the main goal, and list all the assumptions given. However, the user's example also added an assumption not present in the original problem (n divisible by 7), but in reality, that might have been a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the user intended that in the example, the original problem had an error, but we should not focus on that. So, in the current case, the main problem is to show H₃(E_∞) ≠ 0, and the assumptions include all the given conditions: the structure of E_∞, the existence of ȟ, the assumption that ȟ_* = 0, the construction of X, Y, etc.\n\nBut perhaps the key assumptions here are the ones that are given as premises for the problem. For instance:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- E_∞ is the 2-dimensional Hawaiian Earring defined as the union of spheres in ℝ³.\n- There exists a continuous map ȟ: S³ → E_∞ such that the projection to any S² in E_∞ is homotopic to the Hopf map.\n- C_ȟ is the mapping cone of ȟ.\n- ȟ_* = 0 in H₃(E_∞).\n- X is a finite simplicial complex with boundary S³ such that ȟ extends to k: X → E_∞.\n- Y is constructed by gluing D⁴ to X, resulting in a map l: Y → C_ȟ.\n\nThen the problem would be to show that H₃(E_∞) ≠ 0 by proving parts (1), (2), (3) leading to a contradiction.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the problem is stated as the main task, with the assumptions listed. So perhaps the problem statement here is the main goal, and the steps (1)-(3) are part of the solution, not part of the problem statement. However, the original problem explicitly lists parts (1)-(3) as parts that need to be proven. Therefore, perhaps the formatted problem should include these parts as the problem. But the user's example only had the main problem.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, but following the example where the formatted problem was the main statement, I think here the main problem is to prove that H₃(E_∞) ≠ 0, with the assumptions including the existence of the map ȟ, the construction of the mapping cone, etc. However, the user's problem explicitly says \"the object of the exercise is to show that [...] H₃(E_∞) ≠ 0 [...]\", so that is the main problem. The parts (1)-(3) are steps to achieve that, but according to the format, we need to state the problem as the main task, and list the assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: E_∞ is the 2-D Hawaiian Earring defined as the infinite union of spheres,\nAssumption: There exists a continuous map ȟ: S³ → E_∞ such that projections to any S² in E_∞ are homotopic to the Hopf map,\nAssumption: C_ȟ is the mapping cone of ȟ,\nAssumption: ȟ_* = 0 in H₃(E_∞),\nAssumption: X is a finite simplicial complex with boundary S³ allowing ȟ to extend to k: X → E_∞,\nAssumption: Y is constructed as X ∪ D⁴ with map l: Y → C_ȟ,\nProblem: Show that H₃(E_∞) ≠ 0 by proving (1) H²(C_ȟ) contains subgroup ℤ<ζ₁, ζ₂, ...> and H⁴(C_ȟ) ≅ ℤ<η> with specified cup products, (2) l*(η) is nontrivial in H⁴(Y), and (3) l*(ζ_i) are linearly independent, leading to a contradiction.\n\nBut this seems too long. The example had a concise problem statement. Alternatively, the main problem is to show H₃(E_∞) ≠ 0, and the other parts are steps, so perhaps the formatted problem is just \"Prove that H₃(E_∞) ≠ 0\" with the assumptions listed. However, the user's original problem mentions that the parts (1)-(3) are to be proven as part of the process. So maybe the problem should be structured as three separate problems, but the user's format example has one problem. The user's instruction says to \"structure that problem as the following format\" where the example includes one problem. But the current problem has multiple parts. The user says \"they lie in the same vein of the single proof\", so perhaps the problem is considered as one with multiple parts.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is the main goal, and the parts are steps, which are not listed in the problem statement but are part of the solution. Given the user's example, the formatted problem should be the main problem. Therefore:\n\nAssumption: E_∞ is the 2-D Hawaiian Earring,\nAssumption: There exists a continuous map ȟ: S³ → E_∞ such that each projection to S² in E_∞ is homotopic to the Hopf map,\nAssumption: The mapping cone C_ȟ has cohomology groups with specified cup products,\nAssumption: ȟ_* = 0 in H₃(E_∞),\nAssumption: X is a finite simplicial complex extending ȟ to k: X → E_∞,\nAssumption: Y is constructed from X and D⁴ with map l: Y → C_ȟ,\nProblem: Prove that H₃(E_∞) ≠ 0.\n\nBut I need to ensure each assumption is one line, one property applied to one object. Let me list each assumption properly:\n\nAssumption:\nE_∞ is the 2-dimensional analogue of the Hawaiian Earring, defined as the union of spheres {(x,y,z) | (x-1/n)² + y² + z² = 1/n²} for n ≥ 1,\nThe Hopf map h: S³ → S² exists,\nThere exists a continuous map ȟ: S³ → E_∞ such that the projection to each S² in E_∞ is homotopic to h,\nC_ȟ is the mapping cone of ȟ,\nȟ_* = 0 in H₃(E_∞),\nX is a finite simplicial complex with boundary S³,\nThe map ȟ extends to a map k: X → E_∞,\nY is the space X ∪ D⁴ formed by attaching D⁴ to X along S³,\nThere exists a map l: Y → C_ȟ sending D⁴ to the cone part of C_ȟ.\n\nProblem:\nProve that H₃(E_∞) ≠ 0 by showing:\n1. H²(C_ȟ) contains a subgroup ℤ<ζ₁, ζ₂, ...> and H⁴(C_ȟ) ≅ ℤ<η> with ζ_i ∪ ζ_i = η and ζ_i ∪ ζ_j = 0 for i ≠ j,\n2. l*(η) is a nontrivial element of H⁴(Y),\n3. The elements l*(ζ_i) are linearly independent in H²(Y),\nleading to a contradiction since H²(Y) is finitely generated.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the problem should be stated concisely, possibly without the sub-parts. However, since the original problem explicitly mentions these three parts, perhaps they should be included in the problem statement. The user's example included the problem as the main divisibility statement, so perhaps here the problem is the main goal, with the parts as steps. But the user's instruction says to structure the problem as per the format, which includes listing assumptions and the problem. Therefore, the problem would be to prove H₃(E_∞) ≠ 0, with the assumptions including the existence of ȟ, the cone, etc.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is to complete the proof by showing parts (1)-(3), then the problem statement would include those parts. However, the original problem's main objective is to show H₃(E_∞) ≠ 0, and the parts are steps towards that. Given the user's example, I think the formatted problem should state the main goal, and the assumptions are the given conditions. The user's example included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (n divisible by 7), but perhaps that was a mistake, so we should focus on the original problem's given assumptions.\n\nTherefore, after careful consideration, the assumptions are:\n\n- E_∞ is the 2-D Hawaiian Earring as defined.\n- The Hopf map h: S³ → S² exists.\n- There's a map ȟ: S³ → E_∞ with projections homotopic to h.\n- C_ȟ is the mapping cone of ȟ.\n- Assumption: ȟ_* = 0 in H₃(E_∞).\n- X is a finite simplicial complex with boundary S³ extending ȟ to k: X → E_∞.\n- Y is X ∪ D⁴ with map l: Y → C_ȟ.\n\nProblem: Prove that H₃(E_∞) ≠ 0 by establishing the cohomology structure of C_ȟ (part 1), showing l*(η) is nontrivial (part 2), and l*(ζ_i) are linearly independent (part 3), leading to a contradiction.\n\nBut to adhere strictly to the example, the problem should be the main statement, and the parts are part of the solution. However, since the user explicitly mentioned the three parts in the problem statement, perhaps they should be included. But the example didn't include sub-parts. This is a bit conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, the problem can be stated as the main goal, and the three parts are considered as parts of the problem. However, the user's format example didn't do that. Given the ambiguity, I'll proceed to list the assumptions and state the main problem as showing H₃(E_∞) ≠ 0 via the three parts, but perhaps the user's intended format is to list each assumption and then state the problem as the main objective.\n\nGiven that, here's the formatted problem:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: $E_\\infty$ is the 2-dimensional Hawaiian Earring defined as $\\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty \\{(x,y,z) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 \\mid (x-1/n)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1/n^2\\}$,\nAssumption: There exists a continuous map $\\tilde{h}: S^3 \\to E_\\infty$ such that the projection to any $S^2$ in $E_\\infty$ is homotopic to the Hopf map $h: S^3 \\to S^2$,\nAssumption: $C_{\\tilde{h}}$ is the mapping cone of $\\tilde{h}$,\nAssumption: $\\tilde{h}_* = 0$ in $H_3(E_\\infty)$,\nAssumption: There exists a finite simplicial complex $X$ with boundary $S^3$ such that $\\tilde{h}$ extends to a map $k: X \\to E_\\infty$,\nAssumption: $Y = X \\cup \\mathbb{D}^4$ is formed by attaching $\\mathbb{D}^4$ to $X$ along $S^3$,\nAssumption: There exists a map $l: Y \\to C_{\\tilde{h}}$ sending $\\mathbb{D}^4$ to the cone part of $C_{\\tilde{h}}$,\nProblem: Prove that $H_3(E_\\infty) \\neq 0$ by showing:\n1. $H^2(C_{\\tilde{h}})$ contains a subgroup $\\mathbb{Z}\\langle \\zeta_1, \\zeta_2, \\ldots \\rangle$ and $H^4(C_{\\tilde{h}}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}\\langle \\eta \\rangle$ with $\\zeta_i \\cup \\zeta_i = \\eta$ and $\\zeta_i \\cup \\zeta_j = 0$ for $i \\neq j$,\n2. $l^*(\\eta)$ is a nontrivial element of $H^4(Y)$,\n3.

However, the original problem has three parts. Therefore, perhaps the problem should be stated as the main goal, and the three parts are part of the assumptions or the problem. However, the example's problem was a single statement. To resolve this, perhaps the three parts are considered as the problem, but that deviates from the example. Alternatively, the main problem is to reach the contradiction showing H₃ ≠ 0, which requires proving the three parts. Therefore, the problem statement is to \"Prove that H₃(E_∞) ≠ 0\" and the three parts are steps, but in the formatted problem, we state the problem as the main task.\n\nBut the user's example included the main problem statement with the specific mathematical expression, so perhaps here the formatted problem is the main problem, and the three parts are part of the solution. Therefore, the final formatted problem would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: $E_\\infty$ is the 2-dimensional Hawaiian Earring defined as the union of spheres $\\{(x,y,z) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 \\mid (x - 1/n)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1/n^2\\}$ for $n \\geq 1$,\nAssumption: The Hopf map $h: S^3 \\to S^2$ exists,\nAssumption: There is a continuous map $\\tilde{h}: S^3 \\to E_\\infty$ such that each projection to $S^2$ in $E_\\infty$ is homotopic to $h$,\nAssumption: The mapping cone $C_{\\tilde{h}}$ has cohomology groups $H^2(C_{\\tilde{h}})$ containing a subgroup $\\mathbb{Z}\\langle \\zeta_1, \\zeta_2, \\ldots \\rangle$ and $H^4(C_{\\tilde{h}}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}\\langle \\eta \\rangle$,\nAssumption: $\\tilde{h}_* = 0$ in $H_3(E_\\infty)$,\nAssumption: $X$ is a finite simplicial complex with boundary $S^3$ extending $\\tilde{h}$ to $k: X \\to E_\\infty$,\nAssumption: $Y = X \\cup \\mathbb{D}^4$ is constructed by attaching a 4-disk to $X$,\nAssumption: The map $l: Y \\to C_{\\tilde{h}}$ sends $\\mathbb{D}^4$ to the cone part of $C_{\\tilde{h}}$,\nProblem: Prove that $H_3(E_\\infty) \\neq 0$.\n###END_OF_FORMAT###\n\nBut this omits the three parts. However, the user's example didn't include steps in the problem statement. Since the user's original problem mentions \"the object of the exercise is to show that [...] H₃(E_∞) ≠ 0 [...]\", the formatted problem's main task is that. The three parts are steps in the proof, which might be considered as separate problems, but according to the user's instruction to filter unrelated information and structure the problem, we should focus on the main problem and list the relevant assumptions.\n\nTherefore, after careful consideration, the correct formatted problem is as above, with the main problem being to prove H₃(E_∞) ≠ 0, and the assumptions include all the given conditions and constructions leading to that proof.",
