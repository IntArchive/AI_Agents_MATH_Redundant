    "Content": "In several papers on spaceability I found cited the following theorem of Levine and Milman (1940): Theorem: Let $E$ be a closed subspace of $C([0,1])$ (that is $C([0,1],\\mathbb{R})$ endowed with the maximum norm $\\|\\cdot\\|_\\infty$ ) such that each $f \\in E$ is of bounded variation. Then $\\dim E < \\infty$ . I woluld like to see a proof of this theorem but couldn't find one neither online nor offline. So, I tried\nto prove it myself, but I got stuck. Here's my attempt: Let $\\|f\\|_v := |f(0)| + Var_f([0,1])$ , and note that $\\|f\\|_\\infty \\le \\|f\\|_v$ for each $f \\in C([0,1]) \\cap BV([0,1])$ . Set $$\n A_n:=\\{f \\in E: \\|f\\|_v \\le n\\}, \\quad n \\in \\mathbb{N}.\n $$ Each $A_n$ is a closed subset of $E$ (note that $E$ is endowed with $\\|\\cdot\\|_\\infty$ ) and $E= A_1\\cup A_2 \\cup A_3 \\cup \\dots$ .\nBy Baire's Theorem some $A_n$ contains a closed ball of $E$ . Thus the closed unit ball $B_1(E)$ is contained in some $A_n$ . This implies that $\\|\\cdot\\|_\\infty$ and $\\|\\cdot\\|_v$ are equivalent norms on $E$ . Now, I would like to prove that $B_1(E)$ is compact. If you replace for a moment \"of bounded variation\" by \"Lipschitz continuous\", then Arzela-Ascoli could be applied at this point and $\\dim E < \\infty$ would follow. But a closed and bounded subset $M$ of $C([0,1])$ with the property that $\\|f\\|_v \\le c$ for a constant $c$ and each $f \\in M$ is not compact, in general (e.g. $M=\\{t \\mapsto t^n: n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$ ). Thus, in a proof of compactness of $B_1(E)$ the vector space structure of $E$ should play a central role. I can explain by an example what I mean by that: Consider the functions $f_n:[0,1] \\to \\mathbb{R}$ , $n \\ge 2$ defined as $$\nf_n(x)=nx ~ (x \\in [0,1/n]), ~~ f_n(x)=2-nx ~ (x \\in [1/n,2/n]), ~~ f_n(x)=0 ~ (x \\in [2/n,1]).\n$$ There is a sequence $(n_k)$ such that $\\|f_{n_1} + \\dots +f_{n_k}\\|_\\infty$ is uniformly bounded in $k$ and $\\|f_{n_1} + \\dots + f_{n_k}\\|_v \\to \\infty$ as $k \\to \\infty$ . Thus $f_n \\in E$ $(n \\ge 2)$ is impossible. So, I assumed that $\\dim E = \\infty$ and tried to construct functions in $E$ with $\\|f\\|_\\infty$ small but $\\|f\\|_v$ big, but didn't succeed. A second idea leading to nowhere up to now was that Helly's First Theorem could help: It's known that each sequence in $B_1(E)$ has a pointwise convergent subsequence. So, three questions: Can somebody finish this proof? Is there a better (easier) proof? Is there an accessible reference with a proof of this theorem? Thanks for any support. Edit: The Lemma mentioned by daw in the comments would indeed finish the proof: Let $(f_n)$ be a sequence in $B_1(E)$ , w.l.o.g. pointwise convergent (Helly). Then it is a Cauchy sequence in $E$ : Otherwise there is some $\\varepsilon_0 > 0$ such that $$\n\\forall n \\exists k_n,l_n \\ge n: ~ \\|f_{k_n}-f_{l_n}\\|_\\infty \\ge \\varepsilon_0.\n$$ But $f_{k_n}-f_{l_n} \\to 0$ pointwise as $n \\to \\infty$ , hence by the Lemma $\\|f_{k_n}-f_{l_n}\\|_\\infty \\to 0$ as $n \\to \\infty$ , a contradiction. Thus all is reduced to prove the following Lemma : If $(f_n)$ is a bounded sequence in $E$ with $f_n \\to 0$ pointwise, then $\\|f_n\\|_\\infty \\to 0$ .",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Using somewhat advanced results from the theory of Banach spaces\n(in particular, Dvoretzky's theorem ),\none can make the idea suggested by @Gio67 for constructing\nfunctions $h \\in E$ with total variation much bigger than their $L^\\infty$ -norm\ninto a rigorous proof. Let us assume towards a contradiction that there exists an infinite-dimensional,\nclosed subspace $E \\subset C([0,1])$ satisfying $E \\subset BV$ .\nAs noted by the OP and also shown in the answer by @Gio67, there then exists\na constant $M > 0$ satisfying $\\mathrm{Var}(f) \\leq M \\cdot \\| f \\|_\\infty$ for all $f \\in E$ . In the following, consider $E$ as a Banach space equipped with the norm $\\| \\cdot \\|_\\infty$ .\nThen, Dvoretzky's theorem\n(in the version given in this paper )\nshows for any given $N \\in \\mathbb{N}$ that there exists a subspace $V_N \\subset E$ of dimension $\\dim V_N = 2 N$ and such that $d(V_N, \\ell_2^{2N}) < 2$ ,\nmeaning that there exists an isomorphism $T : V_{N} \\to \\ell_2^{2N}$ satisfying $\\| T \\| \\cdot \\| T^{-1} \\| < 2$ .\nHere, $\\ell_2^{2N}$ is $\\mathbb{R}^{2N}$ , equipped with the standard Euclidean norm. Fix a basis $(f_1,\\dots,f_{2N})$ for $V_N$ .\nThen, Theorem 2 in this paper\nshows that there exist $x_1,\\dots,x_{2N} \\in [0,1]$ (so-called Fekete points) and functions $g_1,\\dots,g_{2 N} : [0,1] \\to \\mathbb{R}$ with $\\| g_i \\|_{\\infty} \\leq 2$ and such that $$\n  f = \\sum_{\\ell=1}^{2 N} f(x_\\ell) \\, g_\\ell\n  \\qquad \\forall \\, f \\in V_{N}.\n  \\tag{$\\ast$}\n$$ It is not too difficult to see that $$\n  g_1,\\dots,g_{2N} \\in V_N\n  \\quad \\text{and} \\quad\n  g_i (x_k) = \\delta_{i,k}.\n  \\tag{$\\lozenge$}\n$$ Indeed, first note that $(\\ast)$ implies $V_N \\subset \\mathrm{span} \\{ g_1,\\dots,g_{2N} \\}$ .\nSince $\\dim V_N = 2 N$ , this easily implies $V_N = \\mathrm{span} \\{ g_1,\\dots,g_{2N} \\}$ and in particular $g_1,\\dots,g_{2N} \\in V_N$ .\nHence, the linear maps $S : V_N \\to \\mathbb{R}^{2N}, f \\mapsto (f(x_i))_{1 \\leq i \\leq 2N}$ and $R : \\mathbb{R}^{2 N} \\to V_N, c \\mapsto \\sum_{\\ell=1}^{2N} c_\\ell \\, g_\\ell$ are well-defined.\nBy $(\\ast)$ , we see $R S = \\mathrm{id}_{V_N}$ .\nTherefore, $R$ is surjective and $S$ is injective.\nSince all dimensions agree, this means that $R,S$ are both bijective with $S = R^{-1}$ and hence $S R = \\mathrm{id}_{\\mathbb{R}^{2N}}$ .\nThis easily implies $g_i (x_k) = \\delta_{i,k}$ . Equation $(\\lozenge)$ implies in particular that $x_i \\neq x_j$ for $i \\neq j$ .\nHence, by relabeling, we can assume that $0 \\leq x_1 < x_2 < \\dots < x_{2N} \\leq 1$ .\nNow, let $(\\epsilon_i)_{i=1,\\dots,N}$ be independent Rademacher random variables\n(that is, $\\mathbb{P}(\\epsilon_i = 1) = \\mathbb{P}(\\epsilon_i = -1) = \\frac{1}{2}$ ). The idea is to use these Rademacher random variables and the fact that $V_N$ is \"almost a Hilbert space\" to introduce a suitable form of \"almost orthogonality\",\nin order to produce a function with $L^\\infty$ norm of order $O(\\sqrt{N})$ but with\ntotal variation of order $O(N)$ . Explicitly, note that if $h_1,\\dots,h_N$ are elements of a Hilbert space $H$ , then $$\n  \\mathbb{E}\n  \\Big\\|\n    \\sum_{i=1}^N \\epsilon_i \\, h_i\n  \\Big\\|_H^2\n  = \\sum_{i,j = 1}^N\n    \\Big(\n      \\langle h_i,h_j \\rangle_H\n      \\cdot \\mathbb{E} [\\epsilon_i \\epsilon_j]\n    \\Big)\n  = \\sum_{i=1}^N\n      \\| h_i \\|_H^2 ,\n$$ since $\\mathbb{E} [\\epsilon_i \\epsilon_j] = \\mathbb{E} [\\epsilon_i] \\cdot \\mathbb{E} [\\epsilon_j] = 0$ whenever $i \\neq j$ .\nTherefore, using the operator $T : V_N \\to \\ell_2^{2N}$ that we got from Dvoretzky's theorem,\nwe see \\begin{align*}\n  \\mathbb{E}\n  \\Big\\|\n    \\sum_{i=1}^N\n      \\epsilon_i \\, g_{2 i}\n  \\Big\\|_\\infty^2\n  & = \\mathbb{E}\n    \\Big\\|\n      T^{-1}\n      \\sum_{i=1}^N\n        \\epsilon_i \\, T g_{2 i}\n    \\Big\\|_\\infty^2 \\\\\n  & \\leq \\| T^{-1} \\|^2\n         \\cdot \\mathbb{E}\n               \\Big\\|\n                 \\sum_{i=1}^N\n                   \\epsilon_i \\, T g_{2 i}\n               \\Big\\|_{\\ell_2^{2N}}^2 \\\\\n  & =    \\| T^{-1} \\|^2 \\cdot \\sum_{i=1}^N \\| T g_{2 i} \\|_{\\ell_2^{2N}}^2 \\\\\n  & \\leq \\| T^{-1} \\|^2 \\cdot \\| T \\|^2 \\cdot \\sum_{i=1}^N \\| g_{2 i} \\|_{\\infty}^2\n    \\leq 16 \\cdot N ,\n\\end{align*} since $\\| T^{-1} \\| \\cdot \\| T \\| < 2$ and $\\| g_i \\|_\\infty \\leq 2$ .\nIn particular, there exists at least one choice\nof $\\epsilon_1,\\dots,\\epsilon_N \\in \\{ \\pm 1 \\}$ such that $$\n  h := \\sum_{i=1}^N\n         \\epsilon_i \\, g_{2 i}\n    \\in V_N\n$$ satisfies $$\n  \\| h \\|_\\infty \\leq \\sqrt{16 \\cdot N} = 4 \\sqrt{N},\n  \\quad \\text{and hence} \\quad\n  \\mathrm{Var}(h)\n  \\leq M \\cdot \\| h \\|_\\infty\n  \\leq 4 M \\sqrt{N}.\n$$ To complete the proof, note that $(\\lozenge)$ and the definition of $h$ imply that $h(x_\\ell) = 0$ for $\\ell$ odd\nand that $h(x_{2 i}) = \\epsilon_i$ for $1 \\leq i \\leq N$ .\nTherefore, $$\n  \\mathrm{Var}(h)\n  \\geq \\sum_{\\ell=1}^{2N - 1}\n         \\bigl|h(x_{\\ell+1}) - h(x_\\ell)\\bigr|\n  \\geq \\sum_{i = 1}^{N}\n         \\bigl|h(x_{2 i}) - h(x_{2 i - 1})\\bigr|\n  =    \\sum_{i=1}^{N}\n         |\\epsilon_i|\n  =    N.\n$$ Hence, we see that $N \\leq \\mathrm{Var}(h) \\leq 4 M \\sqrt{N}$ ,\nwhere $M$ is fixed and $N \\in \\mathbb{N}$ can be chosen arbitrarily large.\nThis is clearly impossible and thus provides the desired contradiction.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem and structure it according to the user's format. The original question is about proving that a closed subspace E of C([0,1]) where every function is of bounded variation must have finite dimension. The user attempted to use norms involving bounded variation and equivalence of norms, then considered compactness via Arzela-Ascoli but realized that's not directly applicable. They mentioned using Helly's theorem and a lemma about pointwise convergence implying uniform convergence.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let me go through the problem step by step.\n\n1. E is a closed subspace of C([0,1]). The space C([0,1]) is equipped with the maximum norm (sup norm).\n2. Every function f in E is of bounded variation on [0,1].\n3. The problem is to show that the dimension of E is finite.\n\nWait, in the example provided, assumptions are more specific. The original theorem states E is closed, a subspace of C([0,1]) with maximum norm, and each f in E has bounded variation. So each of these should be separate assumptions. Let me list them:\n\n- E is a closed subspace of C([0,1]).\n- C([0,1]) is endowed with the maximum norm ‖·‖_∞.\n- Each function f in E is of bounded variation on [0,1].\n\nThat's three assumptions. Then the problem is to prove that dim E < ∞.\n\nWait, the user's original problem mentions the theorem by Levine and Milman (1940), which states that such E must be finite-dimensional. The user is trying to prove this theorem. So the problem is to prove that E has finite dimension under these assumptions.\n\nLet me check the example again. The example had:\n\nAssumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nIn the current case, the assumptions are about E being a closed subspace, in C([0,1]) with max norm, and each f in E is BV. The problem is to show dim E is finite.\n\nSo structuring:\n\nAssumption:\nE is a closed subspace of C([0,1]),\nC([0,1]) is endowed with the maximum norm ‖·‖_∞,\nEvery function f in E is of bounded variation on [0,1].\n\nProblem:\nProve that the dimension of E is finite.\n\nWait, but the original problem statement in the user's question is \"Prove that a closed subspace of C([0,1]) with all functions of bounded variation has finite dimension.\" So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- E is a closed subspace of C([0,1]).\n- Each function in E is of bounded variation.\n- C([0,1]) is equipped with the maximum norm.\n\nBut maybe the norm is part of the space's structure, so maybe including that as an assumption is necessary. However, in the example given, the user included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, the key assumptions are E is closed, subspace of C([0,1]) with sup norm, and all functions in E are BV. Each of these is a separate condition on E and the space it's in. So each as a separate line.\n\nYes, so each assumption is a single property applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nE is a closed subspace of C([0,1]),\nC([0,1]) is endowed with the maximum norm ‖·‖_∞,\nEach function f in E is of bounded variation on [0,1].\n\nProblem:\nProve that the dimension of E is finite.\n\nThat seems correct. Let me check if any other assumptions are implied. The user's attempt mentions equivalence of norms (‖·‖_v and ‖·‖_∞), and using Baire's theorem. But those are part of their approach, not the original problem's assumptions. The original problem's assumptions are just the three listed. So that should be the structured format.",
