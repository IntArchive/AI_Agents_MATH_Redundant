    "Content": "Show that the Stone–Čech compactification $\\beta \\mathbb{Z}$ is not metrizable (here $\\mathbb{Z}$ denotes the set of integer numbers in discrete topology). Definition. Let $X$ be a completely regular space.  We say $\\beta (X)$ is a *Stone–Čech compactification * of $X$ if it is a compactification of $X$ such that any continuous map $f:X\\rightarrow C$ of $X$ into a compact Hausdorff space $C$ extends uniquely to a continuous map $g:\\beta (X)\\rightarrow C$. We also have a theorem that states if $X$ is metrizable, then $X$ is first countable.  So, if we show that $\\beta (\\mathbb{Z}) $ is not first countable, then we have our conclusion. I've looked online for proofs of this fact and can't seem to find any.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "In order to show that $\\beta(\\mathbb Z)$ is not first countable, it will suffice to show that $|\\beta(\\mathbb Z)|\\gt2^{\\aleph_0},$ since a Hausdorff space which is separable and first countable has cardinality at most $2^{\\aleph_0}$ (each point is the limit of a convergent sequence of points in a countable dense set). The space $C=\\{0,1\\}^\\mathbb R$ is a separable compact Hausdorff space. Define a countable dense subset $S\\subseteq C$ and a surjection $f:\\mathbb Z\\to S.$ Since $\\mathbb Z$ is discrete, $f$ is continuous, and therefore extends to a continuous surjection $g:\\beta(\\mathbb Z)\\to C,$ showing that $|\\beta(\\mathbb Z)|\\ge|C|=2^{2^{\\aleph_0}}\\gt2^{\\aleph_0}.$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. Let me first read the original problem carefully.\n\nThe original problem is to show that the Stone–Čech compactification βℤ is not metrizable. The user provided some context: ℤ is the integers with discrete topology, and the definition of Stone–Čech compactification. They also mentioned a theorem that if a space is metrizable, then it's first countable. So the strategy is to show βℤ isn't first countable, hence not metrizable.\n\nNow, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. The example given earlier listed assumptions line by line, each about one property or condition of one object. Let's parse the original question.\n\nAssumptions here would include:\n- X is a completely regular space (since βX is defined for such spaces).\n- βℤ is the Stone–Čech compactification of ℤ.\n- ℤ has the discrete topology.\n- The theorem: If a space is metrizable, then it is first countable.\n- The problem's approach: Show βℤ is not first countable.\n\nWait, but the problem statement is to show βℤ is not metrizable. The user's approach is to use the theorem and show it's not first countable. However, in the example, the assumption included the divisibility by 7 for n, which was part of the problem's conditions. Here, the assumptions would be the given definitions and properties. Let me list them:\n\n1. ℤ is a discrete topological space.\n2. βℤ is the Stone–Čech compactification of ℤ.\n3. A Stone–Čech compactification of a completely regular space X is a compactification such that any continuous map from X to a compact Hausdorff space extends uniquely.\n4. If a space is metrizable, then it is first countable.\n\nBut the problem is to show βℤ is not metrizable. The user's approach is to show it's not first countable. However, the problem statement as given doesn't mention first countability; it's part of the user's reasoning. So the actual problem is to show βℤ is not metrizable, with the given definition. The assumptions would be the properties given in the problem statement, not the user's plan.\n\nSo, the assumptions should include:\n\n- ℤ is a discrete topological space.\n- βℤ is the Stone–Čech compactification of ℤ (per the definition provided).\n- The theorem linking metrizability to first countability.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement provides the definition of Stone–Čech compactification and mentions the theorem. The user is using that theorem as part of their approach, but the actual problem doesn't require assuming the theorem; it's a known result. So perhaps the key assumptions are:\n\n- ℤ is a discrete topological space.\n- βℤ is the Stone–Čech compactification of ℤ (as per the given definition).\n- The theorem that metrizable spaces are first countable.\n\nBut the problem is to show βℤ is not metrizable. So maybe the assumptions are just the properties given in the problem statement. Let me check the example again. In the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, perhaps:\n\nAssumptions:\n- ℤ is a discrete topological space.\n- βℤ is the Stone–Čech compactification of ℤ.\n- Any continuous map from ℤ to a compact Hausdorff space C extends uniquely to βℤ.\n\nWait, the definition given in the problem says that βX is a compactification where any continuous map from X to a compact Hausdorff space extends uniquely. So that's part of the definition, hence an assumption.\n\nBut the problem is to show βℤ is not metrizable, using that definition. So the structured problem should list the necessary conditions given. Let me structure it:\n\nAssumption:\nℤ is a discrete topological space,\nβℤ is the Stone–Čech compactification of ℤ,\nFor any completely regular space X, βX is a compactification such that any continuous map f: X → C (C compact Hausdorff) extends uniquely to g: βX → C,\nIf a space is metrizable, then it is first countable.\n\nWait, but the theorem is part of general topology, so perhaps it's a given fact, not an assumption. The problem states that \"we have a theorem...\" So maybe that theorem is a known result, not part of the problem's assumptions. However, in the example, the user included the divisibility by 7 as an assumption, even though in the original problem it wasn't stated—it was part of the solution approach. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The user's formatted problem changed it to assume n is divisible by 7. But that seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect. Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example, but I have to follow their format.\n\nWait, perhaps in their example, the original problem had an error or perhaps the user intended to restructure it. But according to the instructions, I need to filter the unrelated information and structure the problem with assumptions and problem.\n\nIn the given example, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Unless the user made a mistake. But perhaps in the example, the problem was actually to prove for n divisible by 7, but the original problem was different. Alternatively, maybe the example is incorrect. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instruction to format the current problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the user mentions that βℤ is the Stone–Čech compactification of ℤ, which is a discrete space. The problem is to show it's not metrizable. The user's approach is to show it's not first countable, using the theorem that metrizable implies first countable.\n\nBut when structuring the problem, the assumptions should include the given conditions. The problem statement is to show βℤ is not metrizable. The user provided the definition of Stone–Čech compactification and mentions the theorem. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- ℤ is a discrete topological space.\n- βℤ is the Stone–Čech compactification of ℤ.\n- (From the theorem) If a space is metrizable, then it is first countable.\n\nBut maybe the theorem is a general fact and not an assumption. The problem might just be to show βℤ is not metrizable, given that it's the Stone–Čech compactification of the discrete space ℤ. The user's approach is a hint, but the actual problem statement doesn't require including the theorem as an assumption. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- ℤ is a discrete topological space.\n- βℤ is the Stone–Čech compactification of ℤ.\n\nProblem: Show that βℤ is not metrizable.\n\nBut the user's original question includes the definition of Stone–Čech compactification, so maybe we need to include that as part of the assumptions. The definition says that for any completely regular X, βX is a compactification such that any continuous map from X to a compact Hausdorff C extends uniquely. Since ℤ is discrete, which is completely regular, so βℤ exists. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- X is a completely regular space.\n- βX is the Stone–Čech compactification of X, meaning it's a compactification where any continuous map from X to a compact Hausdorff space extends uniquely.\n- X = ℤ with discrete topology.\n\nBut the problem is specifically about βℤ. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nℤ is a discrete topological space,\nβℤ is the Stone–Čech compactification of ℤ,\nAny continuous map from ℤ to a compact Hausdorff space extends uniquely to βℤ.\n\nProblem: Show that βℤ is not metrizable.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem mentions the theorem, but the theorem is a known result, perhaps it's not part of the assumptions. The key assumptions are the properties of βℤ and ℤ. I think the main assumptions here are:\n\n- ℤ is equipped with the discrete topology.\n- βℤ is the Stone–Čech compactification of ℤ (as per the given definition).\n\nThe problem is to show βℤ is not metrizable. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nℤ is a discrete topological space,\nβℤ is the Stone–Čech compactification of ℤ,\nAny continuous map from ℤ to a compact Hausdorff space extends uniquely to βℤ.\n\nProblem: Show that βℤ is not metrizable.\n\nBut perhaps the third assumption is part of the definition of Stone–Čech compactification. Since the problem provides the definition, we need to include that as an assumption. Each assumption should address one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\nℤ is a discrete topological space,\nβℤ is a compactification of ℤ,\nFor any compact Hausdorff space C and continuous map f: ℤ → C, f extends uniquely to a continuous map g: βℤ → C.\n\nProblem: Show that βℤ is not metrizable.\n\nAlternatively, the problem's original statement already defines βX for a completely regular space X, so maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nℤ is a completely regular space,\nβℤ is the Stone–Čech compactification of ℤ,\nℤ has the discrete topology.\n\nBut since discrete spaces are completely regular, that's redundant. The key is that ℤ is discrete, hence completely regular, and βℤ is its Stone–Čech compactification.\n\nIn the example given, assumptions were specific conditions on the objects in the problem. So here, the assumptions would be the properties of ℤ and βℤ as given in the problem statement. So:\n\nAssumption:\nℤ is a discrete topological space,\nβℤ is the Stone–Čech compactification of ℤ,\nStone–Čech compactification βX of a completely regular space X allows any continuous map from X to a compact Hausdorff space to extend uniquely to βX.\n\nProblem: Show that βℤ is not metrizable.\n\nBut each assumption should be a single line addressing one property of one object. So breaking it down:\n\n- ℤ is a discrete topological space.\n- βℤ is the Stone–Čech compactification of ℤ.\n- For any completely regular space X, βX is a compactification such that any continuous map from X to a compact Hausdorff space extends uniquely to βX.\n\nBut the third point is part of the definition provided in the problem. Since the problem gives that definition, it's an assumption here. However, in the original problem, the user writes that definition, so we need to include it as assumptions. Therefore, each part of the definition becomes an assumption.\n\nSo, the assumptions would be:\n\n- X is a completely regular space.\n- βX is the Stone–Čech compactification of X.\n- Any continuous map f: X → C, where C is compact Hausdorff, extends uniquely to a continuous map g: βX → C.\n- ℤ is a discrete topological space.\n- βℤ is the Stone–Čech compactification of ℤ.\n\nBut perhaps we can combine some. However, the user's example split assumptions into separate lines. For instance, in the example, two assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nIn this case, the key assumptions relevant to the problem are:\n\n- ℤ is a discrete topological space.\n- βℤ is the Stone–Čech compactification of ℤ (implying it's a compactification where continuous maps extend uniquely).\n\nBut since the definition is part of the problem statement, we need to include it. So:\n\nAssumption:\nℤ is a discrete topological space,\nβℤ is a compactification of ℤ,\nAny continuous map from ℤ to a compact Hausdorff space extends uniquely to βℤ.\n\nProblem: Show that βℤ is not metrizable.\n\nYes, that seems right. Each assumption is a single condition on one object. The first line is about ℤ's topology, the second is that βℤ is a compactification, the third is the extension property of the compactification.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nℤ is a discrete topological space,\nβℤ is a compactification of ℤ,\nAny continuous map from ℤ to a compact Hausdorff space extends uniquely to βℤ.\nProblem: Show that the Stone–Čech compactification βℤ is not metrizable.\n###",
