    "Content": "Let $X$ be a random variable and let $g,f$ be real-valued, nondecreasing, and bounded. Show that $\\mathbb{E}[f(X)g(X)]\\geq \\mathbb{E}[f(X)]\\mathbb{E}[g(X)]$ Having a hard time seeing where to start for some reasons, any hints? I managed to write: $\\mathbb{E}[f(X)g(X)] = \\frac{1}{4}\\mathbb{E}[(f(X)+g(X))^2 - (f(X)-g(X))^2]$ But I'm not sure if this is in the right direction or not.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that the Assumptions should list each condition line by line, applied to one object each. The problem statement then follows.\n\nLooking at the original problem from the user: The title is about showing that the expectation of the product of f(X) and g(X) is greater than or equal to the product of their expectations, given that f and g are bounded, non-decreasing functions. The question body repeats this and adds that the user tried expanding the expectation into a difference of squares but isn't sure if that's helpful.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that X is a random variable. Then, f and g are real-valued, non-decreasing, and bounded. Each of these properties should be listed as separate assumptions. Also, since both f and g have these properties, I need to check if the example treats multiple objects. In the example given, assumptions were listed per object and property. So here, since both f and g are non-decreasing, bounded, and real-valued, each of these properties should be separate lines.\n\nWait, the example had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Each as separate lines. So here, each property for each function. But f and g are both functions, so maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a random variable,\nf is a real-valued function,\nf is non-decreasing,\nf is bounded,\ng is a real-valued function,\ng is non-decreasing,\ng is bounded.\n\nBut wait, in the original problem statement, it says \"let g,f be real-valued, nondecreasing, and bounded.\" So each of these applies to both f and g. However, in the example, each assumption is one property applied to one object. So to follow that structure, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a random variable,\nf is a real-valued function,\ng is a real-valued function,\nf is non-decreasing,\ng is non-decreasing,\nf is bounded,\ng is bounded.\n\nYes, this way each line is a single property for one object.\n\nThen the problem statement is to show that E[f(X)g(X)] >= E[f(X)] E[g(X)].\n\nI need to make sure that the problem part is just the statement to prove, without any extra info like the user's attempt. The example's problem part only includes the original problem's main statement. The user's attempt in the question here (\"I managed to write...\") should be ignored as per the instruction to filter unrelated information.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a random variable,\nf is a real-valued function,\ng is a real-valued function,\nf is non-decreasing,\ng is non-decreasing,\nf is bounded,\ng is bounded.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $\\mathbb{E}[f(X)g(X)] \\geq \\mathbb{E}[f(X)]\\mathbb{E}[g(X)]$.\n\nI think that's it. Each assumption is a single line, addressing one property for one object. The problem is the main statement to prove.",
