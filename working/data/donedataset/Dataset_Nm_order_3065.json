    "Content": "I am trying to prove the binomial identity $$\\sum_{k = 0}^n \\frac{(-1)^k}{2k+1} \\binom{2n - 2k}{n-k} \\binom{n - k}{k} = \\frac{4^n}{n+1},$$ without using induction. Here $n$ is a non-negative integer. The factor of $2k + 1$ in the denominator suggests one try to integrate $x^{2k}$ between the limits of $0$ and $1$ . To do this one would need to know what $$\\sum_{k = 0}^n (-1)^k \\binom{2n - 2k}{n - k} \\binom{n - k}{k} x^{2k},$$ is in closed-form. It seems to involve (according to Mathematica) some hypergeometric function, the integral of which is by no means obvious. I have also tried coefficient extraction methods $[z^n]$ , but again the factor of $2k + 1$ in the denominator makes this problematic (at least for me). So my question is, given the simple form of the expression on the right of this identity, is there a relatively easy way to prove this identity? Perhaps there is some simple trick I am missing?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "That's simple if you recognize Legendre polynomials hidden in such sum. We have $$ P_n(x) = \\frac{1}{2^n}\\sum_{k=0}^{\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor}(-1)^k\\binom{n}{k}\\binom{2n-2k}{n}x^{n-2k}\\stackrel{\\text{Rodrigues}}{=}\\frac{1}{2^n n!}\\cdot\\frac{d^n}{dx^n}(x^2-1)^n \\tag{1}$$ while $$ S(n)=\\sum_{k=0}^{\\lfloor{n/2}\\rfloor}\\frac{(-1)^k}{2k+1}\\binom{2n-2k}{n-k}\\binom{n-k}{k}=\\sum_{k=0}^{\\lfloor{n/2}\\rfloor}\\frac{(-1)^k}{2k+1}\\binom{n}{k}\\binom{2n-2k}{n}\\tag{2}$$ so $$ S(n) = 2^n\\int_{0}^{1}x^n P_n(1/x)\\,dx =2^n \\int_{1}^{+\\infty}\\frac{P_n(x)}{x^{n+2}}\\,dx.\\tag{3}$$ This allows to recover the generating function for $S(n)$ from the generating function of $P_n(x)$ . By multiplying both sides of $(3)$ by $z^n$ and summing over $n\\geq 0$ we have $$\\begin{eqnarray*} \\sum_{n\\geq 0} S(n) z^n &=& \\int_{1}^{+\\infty}\\frac{dx}{x \\sqrt{(1-4z)x^2+4z^2}}\\\\&=&\\frac{1}{2z}\\operatorname{arcsinh}{\\frac{2z}{\\sqrt{1-4z}}}\\\\&=&\\frac{1}{2z}\\operatorname{arctanh}\\left(\\frac{2z}{1-2z}\\right)=\\frac{-\\ln(1-4z)}{4z}\\end{eqnarray*}\\tag{4}$$ and the claim readily follows from the Maclaurin series of the RHS of $(4)$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to prove the binomial identity:\n\n$$\\sum_{k = 0}^n \\frac{(-1)^k}{2k+1} \\binom{2n - 2k}{n-k} \\binom{n - k}{k} = \\frac{4^n}{n+1},$$\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is a non-negative integer, without using induction. They mentioned trying integration and coefficient extraction methods but ran into difficulties. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the summation involves binomial coefficients and alternating signs, which often suggests combinatorial interpretations or generating functions. The presence of \\( \\frac{1}{2k+1} \\) complicates things, but the user thought about integrating \\( x^{2k} \\) from 0 to 1 since \\( \\int_0^1 x^{2k} dx = \\frac{1}{2k+1} \\). That seems like a good approach. Let's explore that.\n\nSo, substituting the integral into the sum, we get:\n\n$$\\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k \\binom{2n - 2k}{n - k} \\binom{n - k}{k} \\int_0^1 x^{2k} dx.$$\n\nInterchanging the sum and integral (if valid), the problem reduces to evaluating:\n\n$$\\int_0^1 \\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k \\binom{2n - 2k}{n - k} \\binom{n - k}{k} x^{2k} dx.$$\n\nNow, the key is to find a closed-form for the sum inside the integral. The user mentioned Mathematica suggested a hypergeometric function, but maybe there's a combinatorial identity we can use here.\n\nLooking at the binomial coefficients \\( \\binom{2n - 2k}{n - k} \\binom{n - k}{k} \\), this resembles the number of ways to choose \\( n - k \\) objects out of \\( 2n - 2k \\), and then \\( k \\) out of the remaining \\( n - k \\). Alternatively, this could be related to counting certain lattice paths or trees.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps generating functions can be applied. Let's consider generating functions for the coefficients.\n\nLet me denote \\( m = n - k \\). Then, when \\( k \\) ranges from 0 to \\( n \\), \\( m \\) ranges from \\( n \\) down to 0. However, this substitution might not simplify things immediately.\n\nWait, let's try to interpret \\( \\binom{2n - 2k}{n - k} \\binom{n - k}{k} \\). Suppose we think of arranging something with two steps. First, choose \\( n - k \\) items from \\( 2n - 2k \\), then choose \\( k \\) from those \\( n - k \\). But this seems a bit convoluted. Maybe there's a combinatorial identity here.\n\nAlternatively, recall that \\( \\binom{2m}{m} \\) is the central binomial coefficient, and \\( \\binom{m}{k} \\) is the number of ways to choose k items from m. So, the term \\( \\binom{2m}{m} \\binom{m}{k} \\) with \\( m = n - k \\). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using generating functions. Let's consider generating functions where the coefficient of \\( x^{2k} \\) is \\( (-1)^k \\binom{2n - 2k}{n - k} \\binom{n - k}{k} \\).\n\nAlternatively, notice that \\( \\binom{2n - 2k}{n - k} \\) is the number of ways to walk \\( 2n - 2k \\) steps, ending at the origin, which might relate to Catalan numbers or similar. But not sure.\n\nAnother approach: generating functions for the product of binomial coefficients. The product \\( \\binom{2n - 2k}{n - k} \\binom{n - k}{k} \\) can be thought of as a product of two binomial coefficients. Maybe using generating functions for such products.\n\nAlternatively, consider that \\( \\binom{2n - 2k}{n - k} \\) is the coefficient of \\( x^{n - k} \\) in \\( (1 + x)^{2n - 2k} \\), and \\( \\binom{n - k}{k} \\) is the coefficient of \\( y^k \\) in \\( (1 + y)^{n - k} \\). But combining these might not lead anywhere.\n\nWait, here's a thought: the term \\( \\binom{2n - 2k}{n - k} \\binom{n - k}{k} \\) can be rewritten as \\( \\frac{(2n - 2k)!}{(n - k)! (n - k)!} \\times \\frac{(n - k)!}{k! (n - 2k)!} \\) = \\( \\frac{(2n - 2k)!}{(n - k)! k! (n - 2k)!} \\).\n\nSimplifying, that's \\( \\frac{(2n - 2k)!}{k! (n - k)! (n - 2k)!} \\). Hmm. Not sure if this helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps recognizing this as a product of binomial coefficients which can be connected to a generating function. For example, generating functions for central binomial coefficients times some other terms.\n\nAlternatively, generating functions involving the sum over k. Let me write the sum as:\n\n$$S = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\frac{(-1)^k}{2k+1} \\binom{2n - 2k}{n - k} \\binom{n - k}{k}.$$\n\nSince integrating x^{2k} gives 1/(2k+1), perhaps as the user suggested, swap sum and integral:\n\n$$S = \\int_0^1 \\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k \\binom{2n - 2k}{n - k} \\binom{n - k}{k} x^{2k} dx.$$\n\nSo if we can evaluate the sum inside, which is:\n\n$$T(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k \\binom{2n - 2k}{n - k} \\binom{n - k}{k} x^{2k}.$$\n\nIf we can find a closed-form for T(x), then integrating from 0 to 1 would give S. The user mentioned that Mathematica gives a hypergeometric function, which might not be helpful, but perhaps there's a generating function identity here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe generating functions for T(x). Let's try small n to see a pattern.\n\nLet's take n=0: then k=0. So T(x) = (-1)^0 * binom(0,0)*binom(0,0)*x^0 = 1*1*1=1. Integral from 0 to1 is 1, which equals 4^0/(0+1) = 1. Checks out.\n\nn=1: k=0 and k=1.\n\nk=0: (-1)^0 * binom(2,1) binom(1,0) x^0 = 2*1 =2.\n\nk=1: (-1)^1 * binom(0,0) binom(0,1) x^2. But binom(0,1)=0, so term is 0. So T(x)=2. Integral is 2*1=2. RHS 4^1/(1+1)=4/2=2. Checks.\n\nn=2: k=0,1,2.\n\nk=0: binom(4,2) binom(2,0) =6*1=6.\n\nk=1: (-1)^1 binom(2,1) binom(1,1) x^2= -1*2*1*x^2= -2x^2.\n\nk=2: binom(0,0) binom(0,2)=0.\n\nSo T(x)=6 -2x^2. Integral from 0 to1 is 6*1 -2*(1/3)=6 - 2/3=16/3. RHS 4^2/(2+1)=16/3. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\nk=0: binom(6,3) binom(3,0)=20*1=20.\n\nk=1: (-1)^1 binom(4,2) binom(2,1) x^2= -1*6*2 x^2= -12x^2.\n\nk=2: (-1)^2 binom(2,1) binom(1,2) x^4=1*2*0=0.\n\nk=3: 0.\n\nSo T(x)=20 -12x^2. Integral from 0 to1 is 20 -12*(1/3)=20 -4=16. RHS 4^3/(3+1)=64/4=16. Correct.\n\nSo for n=0,1,2,3, the integral of T(x) gives the desired result.\n\nSo, T(x) for general n seems to be a polynomial of degree 2k, but from the examples, when n=2, T(x)=6-2x², which is degree 2. For n=3, T(x)=20-12x², which is degree 2 as well. Wait, but n=3, max k=1.5? But k is integer, so k up to floor(n/2). Wait for n=3, k=0,1. So why in n=3, T(x) is degree 2? Because 2k for k=1 is 2. So for n=3, the highest term is x^2. So T(x) is a polynomial of degree 2*floor(n/2). Wait, for n=3, floor(n/2)=1, so 2*1=2. For n=2, floor(n/2)=1, 2*1=2. For n=1, floor(1/2)=0, so degree 0. So T(x) is a polynomial of degree 2*floor(n/2). Interesting.\n\nBut how does T(x) relate to the integral? For example, in n=2, T(x)=6-2x², integral is 16/3. In n=3, T(x)=20 -12x², integral is 16. In n=1, T(x)=2, integral is 2. In n=0, integral 1.\n\nSo the integral of T(x) gives 4^n/(n+1). So perhaps there's a generating function for T(x) that can be integrated to 4^n/(n+1). Alternatively, note that 4^n/(n+1) is the nth Catalan number times 2^{2n}/(n+1). Wait, the nth Catalan number is (1/(n+1))binom(2n,n). But 4^n/(n+1) is different. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe recognizing that 4^n/(n+1) is the integral from 0 to4 of x^n dx divided by something? Not sure.\n\nWait, but 4^n/(n+1) is equal to the integral from 0 to 4 of x^n dx divided by 4? No, integral from 0 to4 of x^n dx =4^{n+1}/(n+1). So 4^{n+1}/(n+1) is the integral. So 4^{n}/(n+1) is 1/4 of that. Not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps generating functions. Suppose that the generating function for the left-hand side sum S(n) =4^n/(n+1). The generating function for S(n) would be sum_{n=0}^\\infty S(n) x^n = sum_{n=0}^\\infty (4^n/(n+1)) x^n = (1/x) sum_{n=0}^\\infty (4x)^{n+1}/(n+1) )= (1/x)(-ln(1 -4x)) ), assuming |4x| <1.\n\nSo generating function is -ln(1 -4x)/x.\n\nOn the other hand, what is the generating function for the left-hand side?\n\nThe left-hand side is sum_{n=0}^\\infty [sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k/(2k+1) binom(2n -2k, n -k) binom(n -k, k) ] x^n.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps interchanging the sums:\n\nsum_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k/(2k+1) sum_{n=k}^\\infty binom(2n -2k, n -k) binom(n -k, k) x^n.\n\nLet me substitute m =n -k. Then n = m +k, so sum becomes:\n\nsum_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k/(2k+1) sum_{m=0}^\\infty binom(2m, m) binom(m, k) x^{m +k}.\n\n= sum_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k/(2k+1) x^k sum_{m=0}^\\infty binom(2m, m) binom(m, k) x^m.\n\nHmm. The inner sum is sum_{m=0}^\\infty binom(2m, m) binom(m, k) x^m.\n\nThis seems challenging. Perhaps using generating functions for binom(2m, m), which is 1/sqrt(1-4x). And binom(m,k) is the coefficient of y^k in (1+y)^m. But combining these?\n\nAlternatively, generating function for binom(2m, m) binom(m, k):\n\nIt's known that sum_{m=0}^\\infty binom(2m, m) binom(m, k) x^m = binom(2k, k) x^k / (1 -4x)^{k + 1/2}}.\n\nWait, I recall that there's an identity: sum_{m=k}^\\infty binom(2m, m) binom(m, k) x^m = \\frac{\\binom{2k}{k} x^k}{(1 -4x)^{k + 1/2}}}.\n\nIf this is the case, then the inner sum becomes:\n\nbinom(2k, k) x^k / (1 -4x)^{k + 1/2}.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression becomes:\n\nsum_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k/(2k+1) * binom(2k, k) x^{2k} / (1 -4x)^{k + 1/2}.\n\nHmm. This seems complicated, but maybe simplifying.\n\nLet me write binom(2k, k) as (2k)!/(k!)^2. Then the term is:\n\nsum_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k/(2k+1) * (2k)!/(k!)^2 * x^{2k} / (1 -4x)^{k + 1/2}.\n\nNot sure. Alternatively, perhaps making substitution or using generating function properties.\n\nAlternatively, if we set t = x^2/(1 -4x), then the term becomes sum_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k/(2k+1) binom(2k,k) t^k / sqrt(1 -4x).\n\nBut this might not help. Alternatively, recognizing the sum as related to an integral.\n\nWait, we have the term 1/(2k+1), which is similar to integrating t^{2k} from 0 to1. Wait, but we already used that in the original approach. Maybe another integral representation.\n\nAlternatively, recall that 1/(2k+1) = \\int_0^1 t^{2k} dt.\n\nSo, substituting back, the generating function for S(n) becomes:\n\nsum_{n=0}^\\infty \\left[ \\int_0^1 \\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k binom(2n -2k, n -k) binom(n -k, k) t^{2k} dt \\right] x^n.\n\nBut this is the same as:\n\n\\int_0^1 sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k binom(2n -2k, n -k) binom(n -k, k) t^{2k} x^n dt.\n\nInterchanging sum and integral (if valid), and swapping the order of summation:\n\n\\int_0^1 sum_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k t^{2k} sum_{n=k}^\\infty binom(2n -2k, n -k) binom(n -k, k) x^n dt.\n\nAgain, substitute m =n -k:\n\n= \\int_0^1 sum_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k t^{2k} x^k sum_{m=0}^\\infty binom(2m, m) binom(m, k) x^m dt.\n\nUsing the identity from before:\n\n= \\int_0^1 sum_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k t^{2k} x^k * \\frac{\\binom{2k}{k} x^k}{(1 -4x)^{k + 1/2}}} dt.\n\n= \\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 -4x}} sum_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k \\binom{2k}{k} \\left( \\frac{t^2 x^2}{(1 -4x)} \\right)^k dt.\n\nNow, the sum over k is:\n\nsum_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k \\binom{2k}{k} z^k = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 +4z}}},\n\nsince the generating function for \\binom{2k}{k} (-z)^k is 1/sqrt(1 +4z).\n\nSo here, z = \\frac{t^2 x^2}{1 -4x}, so the sum becomes:\n\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 +4 \\cdot \\frac{t^2 x^2}{1 -4x}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{4 t^2 x^2}{1 -4x}}}.\n\nThus, the entire expression becomes:\n\n\\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 -4x}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{4 t^2 x^2}{1 -4x}}} dt.\n\nSimplify the denominator inside the square root:\n\n1 + \\frac{4 t^2 x^2}{1 -4x} = \\frac{(1 -4x) +4 t^2 x^2}{1 -4x}.\n\nSo the expression becomes:\n\n\\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 -4x}} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{1 -4x}{(1 -4x) +4 t^2 x^2}}} dt = \\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(1 -4x) +4 t^2 x^2}} dt.\n\nSo, the generating function is:\n\n\\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(1 -4x) +4 t^2 x^2}} dt.\n\nSimplify the expression under the square root:\n\n(1 -4x) +4 t^2 x^2 =4x^2 t^2 + (1 -4x).\n\nLet me factor this:\n\n=4x^2 t^2 -4x +1.\n\nNot obvious. Let's see if it can be rewritten as a square:\n\nSuppose we write it as (2x t -a)^2 + b. Expanding:4x² t² -4a x t +a² +b. Comparing to 4x² t² -4x +1:\n\n-4a x t = -4x => a=1/t. But a is a constant, not depending on t. So this approach might not work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps completing the square in t:\n\n4x² t² + (1 -4x) =4x² t² +0 t + (1 -4x). This is quadratic in t. The integral becomes:\n\n\\int_0^1 \\frac{dt}{\\sqrt{4x² t² + (1 -4x)}}.\n\nThis integral can be evaluated. Let's compute it.\n\nLet me denote A² =4x², B=1 -4x. So the integral becomes:\n\n\\int_0^1 \\frac{dt}{\\sqrt{A² t² + B}}}.\n\nThe antiderivative of 1/sqrt(A² t² + B) is (1/A) sinh^{-1}(A t / sqrt(B)) ), assuming B>0. But we need to check the conditions.\n\nHowever, the generating function is for |x| <1/4 to ensure convergence. But when x is near 1/4, 1 -4x approaches 0, which may complicate things.\n\nBut proceeding formally:\n\nThe integral is:\n\n(1/A) [ sinh^{-1}(A t / sqrt(B)) ] from t=0 to1.\n\n= (1/(2x)) [ sinh^{-1}(2x / sqrt(1 -4x)) - sinh^{-1}(0) ]\n\n= (1/(2x)) sinh^{-1}(2x / sqrt(1 -4x)).\n\nBut sinh^{-1}(z) = ln(z + sqrt(z² +1)), so:\n\n= (1/(2x)) ln( 2x / sqrt(1 -4x) + sqrt( (2x / sqrt(1 -4x))² +1 )).\n\nSimplify inside the square root:\n\n( (4x²)/(1 -4x) ) +1 = (4x² +1 -4x)/(1 -4x) = (1 -4x +4x²)/(1 -4x) = (1 -2x)^2/(1 -4x).\n\nThus, sqrt( (4x² +1 -4x)/(1 -4x) ) = |1 -2x| / sqrt(1 -4x). Since x is small (near 0), 1 -2x is positive.\n\nSo:\n\nsqrt( (2x / sqrt(1 -4x))² +1 ) = (1 -2x)/sqrt(1 -4x).\n\nThus, the expression becomes:\n\n(1/(2x)) ln( 2x / sqrt(1 -4x) + (1 -2x)/sqrt(1 -4x) )\n\n= (1/(2x)) ln( [2x +1 -2x]/sqrt(1 -4x) )\n\n= (1/(2x)) ln( 1 / sqrt(1 -4x) )\n\n= (1/(2x)) * (-1/2) ln(1 -4x)\n\n= - (1/(4x)) ln(1 -4x).\n\nBut wait, the generating function we have is:\n\nsum_{n=0}^\\infty S(n) x^n = -ln(1 -4x)/x.\n\nBut according to our calculation, the integral evaluates to - (1/(4x)) ln(1 -4x). But that's only 1/4 of the desired generating function. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the antiderivative. Let's recheck.\n\nThe integral of 1/sqrt(A² t² + B) dt is (1/A) sinh^{-1}(A t / sqrt(B)) ) + C, which is also equal to (1/A) ln(A t + sqrt(A² t² + B)) ) + C.\n\nSo in our case, A=2x, B=1-4x. So:\n\nIntegral from0 to1 is:\n\n(1/(2x)) [ ln(2x t + sqrt(4x² t² +1 -4x)) ] from0 to1.\n\nAt t=1:\n\nln(2x + sqrt(4x² +1 -4x)).\n\nAt t=0:\n\nln(0 + sqrt(0 +1 -4x)) = ln(sqrt(1 -4x)) = (1/2) ln(1 -4x).\n\nThus, the integral is:\n\n(1/(2x)) [ ln(2x + sqrt(4x² -4x +1)) - (1/2) ln(1 -4x) ].\n\nSimplify the expression under the sqrt:\n\n4x² -4x +1 = (2x -1)^2.\n\nSo sqrt(4x² -4x +1) = |2x -1|. For x <1/4, 2x -1 <0, so sqrt becomes 1 -2x.\n\nThus:\n\nln(2x + (1 -2x)) - (1/2) ln(1 -4x) = ln(1) - (1/2) ln(1 -4x) = - (1/2) ln(1 -4x).\n\nThus, the integral becomes:\n\n(1/(2x)) [ - (1/2) ln(1 -4x) ] = - (1/(4x)) ln(1 -4x).\n\nBut the generating function for S(n) is supposed to be - (1/x) ln(1 -4x). So there's a factor discrepancy: our calculation gives - (1/(4x)) ln(1 -4x), but the generating function for the right-hand side is - (1/x) ln(1 -4x). This suggests a missing factor of 4.\n\nWhere did I go wrong? Let's trace back.\n\nWait, when we derived the generating function for the left-hand side S(n), we ended up with:\n\n∫0^1 [expression] dt = - (1/(4x)) ln(1 -4x).\n\nBut the generating function for the right-hand side is sum_{n=0}^\\infty (4^n/(n+1)) x^n = - (1/x) ln(1 -4x).\n\nThus, according to our calculation, the generating function of the left-hand side is 1/4 of the generating function of the right-hand side. This implies that S(n) =4^{n}/(n+1) equals (1/4) *4^{n}/(n+1) =4^{n-1}/(n+1), which contradicts the examples. Clearly, there's a mistake.\n\nAh, I realize now. When we substituted back into the generating function, we must have made an error in the factors. Let's re-examine the steps.\n\nAfter evaluating the integral, we found that the generating function for the left-hand side is - (1/(4x)) ln(1 -4x). However, the right-hand side generating function is - (1/x) ln(1 -4x). Therefore, there's a missing factor of 4. This suggests that somewhere in the calculation, we lost a factor of4.\n\nLooking back, when we expressed the inner sum as binom(2k,k) x^k / (1 -4x)^{k +1/2}, perhaps there was a miscalculation there.\n\nWait, original identity: sum_{m=0}^\\infty binom(2m, m) binom(m, k) x^m = binom(2k, k) x^k / (1 -4x)^{k +1/2}.\n\nLet me verify this for k=0: sum_{m=0}^\\infty binom(2m, m) binom(m,0) x^m = sum_{m=0}^\\infty binom(2m, m) x^m =1/sqrt(1 -4x). According to the identity, it should be binom(0,0) x^0 / (1 -4x)^{0 +1/2} =1 / sqrt(1 -4x). Correct.\n\nFor k=1: sum_{m=1}^\\infty binom(2m, m) binom(m,1) x^m = sum_{m=1}^\\infty binom(2m, m) m x^m.\n\nUsing binom(2m, m) m = binom(2m, m) binom(m,1).\n\nAccording to the identity, this should be binom(2,1) x^1 / (1 -4x)^{1 +1/2} =2x / (1 -4x)^{3/2}.\n\nLet's check with generating functions.\n\nWe know that sum_{m=0}^\\infty binom(2m, m) x^m =1/sqrt(1 -4x).\n\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to x:\n\nsum_{m=0}^\\infty binom(2m, m) m x^{m-1} = (d/dx) (1 -4x)^{-1/2} )= (1/2)(4)(1 -4x)^{-3/2} =2/(1 -4x)^{3/2}.\n\nThus, sum_{m=0}^\\infty binom(2m, m) m x^{m} =2x/(1 -4x)^{3/2}.\n\nWhich matches the identity for k=1:2x/(1 -4x)^{3/2}. So the identity holds. Therefore, my earlier application of the identity was correct.\n\nSo then, proceeding correctly, after substitution, we have:\n\nsum_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k binom(2k,k) (t^2 x^2 / (1 -4x))^k =1/sqrt(1 +4(t^2 x^2 / (1 -4x)))}.\n\nTherefore, the generating function is:\n\n∫0^1 1/sqrt(1 -4x) *1/sqrt(1 +4t²x²/(1 -4x)) dt.\n\nWhich simplifies to ∫0^1 1/sqrt( (1 -4x)(1 +4t²x²/(1 -4x)) ) dt.\n\n= ∫0^1 1/sqrt(1 -4x +4t²x²) dt.\n\nThen, when we evaluated this integral, we found:\n\n- (1/(4x)) ln(1 -4x).\n\nBut the generating function for the right-hand side is - (1/x) ln(1 -4x). So there's a factor of4 difference. This suggests that our initial approach has a missing factor of4 somewhere, which implies that S(n)=4^n/(n+1) is 4 times the coefficient we calculated.\n\nBut wait, no. The generating function we obtained is - (1/(4x)) ln(1 -4x), which is equal to (1/4x)) * sum_{n=1}^\\infty (4x)^n /n )= sum_{n=1}^\\infty (4^n x^{n-1}) / (4n) )= sum_{n=1}^\\infty 4^{n-1} x^{n-1}/n = sum_{n=0}^\\infty 4^n x^n / (n+1).\n\nWhich is exactly the generating function for the right-hand side S(n)=4^n/(n+1). Thus, the generating function we derived is indeed sum_{n=0}^\\infty S(n) x^n. Therefore, our calculation shows that the generating functions match, hence the coefficients must match. Therefore, the identity holds.\n\nTherefore, by equating the coefficients of x^n in both generating functions, we have that the left-hand side sum equals the right-hand side, 4^n/(n+1). Hence, the identity is proven.\n\nSo, the key steps were:\n\n1. Express the sum as an integral involving T(x) = sum_k (-1)^k binom(...) x^{2k}.\n\n2. Find the generating function for T(x) by using a known binomial coefficient identity.\n\n3. Integrate term-by-term and simplify using generating functions.\n\n4. Show that the generating function of the left-hand side matches that of the right-hand side, hence proving the identity.\n\nTherefore, the answer is to use generating functions and integral interchange, leveraging known binomial identities to simplify the expression.",
