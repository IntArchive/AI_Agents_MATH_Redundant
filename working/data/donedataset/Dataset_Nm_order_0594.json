    "Content": "Here is my conjecture, any proof, counter-example, or intuitions? If $f$ is analytic on $\\text{cl}(\\mathbb{D})$ (that is, analytic on some open set containing $\\text{cl}(\\mathbb{D})$), then there is some injective analytic function $\\phi:\\mathbb{D}\\to\\mathbb{C}$ and polynomial $p$ such that $f=p\\circ\\phi$ on $\\mathbb{D}$. PS: I would then say that $f$ and $p$ are conformally equivalent.  Is there a better term for this relationship? Note: $\\text{cl}(\\mathbb{D})$ could be replaced by any simply connected compact set.  If we wanted to replace \"simply connected\" with \"finitely connected\", then we would have to replace \"polynomial\" with \"rational function\".",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Yes, it is true that you can write $f=p\\circ\\phi$, for a polynomial $p$ and an injective analytic $\\phi\\colon\\mathbb{D}\\to\\mathbb{C}$. In fact, you can replace $\\mathbb{D}$ by any compact subset of $\\mathbb{C}$ and the results still holds, where $p$ is instead required just to be a rational function. First, by expanding as a power series and truncating after $n$ terms, there exists a sequence of polynomials $p_n$ converging uniformly to $f$ on an open set containing $\\mathbb{D}$. This is almost enough, applying the following. Lemma 1: Let $f,\\{p_n\\}_{n=1,2,\\cdots}$ be non-constant analytic functions on an open set $U\\subseteq\\mathbb{C}$ such that $p_n\\to f$ uniformly on $U$. Let $K\\subseteq U$ be compact and suppose that, for each $k\\ge1$ and $z\\in K$ with $f^\\prime(z)=\\cdots=f^{(k)}(z)=0$ then we also have $p_n(z)=f(z)$ and $p_n^\\prime(z)=\\cdots=p_n^{(k)}(z)=0$.\n  Then, for all large enough $n$, there exists ono-to-one analytic $\\phi_n\\colon K\\to U$ with $f=p_n\\circ\\phi_n$. This is enough to obtain the required result, so long as $f^\\prime$ does not vanish on $\\mathbb{D}$, as the condition on the derivatives on $f$ trivially holds. If $f^\\prime$ does vanish somewhere on $\\mathbb{D}$, then we can still obtain the required result by applying the following consequence of Lemma 1. Lemma 2: Let $f,\\{p_n\\}_{n=1,2,\\cdots}$ be non-constant analytic functions on an open set $U\\subseteq\\mathbb{C}$ such that $p_n\\to f$ uniformly on $U$. Then, for any compact $K\\subseteq U$, for large enough $n$ there exists polynomials $q_n$ and ono-to-one analytic $\\phi_n\\colon K\\to U$ such that $f=(p_n-q_n)\\circ\\phi_n$. The polynomials $q_n$ will be of uniformly bounded degree with coefficients tending to zero as $n\\to\\infty$, although we do not require this here. Once Lemma 2 has been established, our required result follows emmediately by using truncated power series approximations for the polynomials $p_n$. In fact, if $\\mathbb{D}$ is replaced by any compact $K$ then the result will still hold where $p$ is instead required to be just be a rational functions. This is because we can uniformly approximate $f$ by a sequence of rational functions $p_n$ on some open set containing $K$, by Runge's theorem . Then, Lemma 2 applies to get the required result. I'll now give proofs of the Lemmas. Here, I make repeated use of the fact that if analytic functions then their derivates to all orders converge uniformly on compacts (a consequence of Cauchy's integral formula, as explained by David Speyer in his answer). Proof of Lemma 1 :\nFirst, restricting $U$ a small enough open set containing $K$, we can w.l.o.g. suppose that for every $z\\in U$ and $k\\ge1$ with $f^\\prime(z)=\\cdots=f^{(k)}(z)=0$ then $p_n(z)=f(z)$ and $p_n^\\prime(z)=\\cdots=p_n^{(k)}(z)=0$. I'll start by proving the result locally; for each $z_0\\in U$ there exists an open neighbourhood $V$ of $z_0$ and a sequence of analytic functions $\\phi_n\\colon V\\to U$ with $\\phi_n(z)\\to z$ uniformly on $V$ and $f=p_n\\circ\\phi_n$ on $V$ for all large $n$. Suppose that $f^\\prime(z_0)\\not=0$. By rescaling $f$ and $p_n$ if required, we can suppose that $f^\\prime(z_0)=1$. For some $r > 0$ the closed ball $\\bar B_r(z_0)$ is contained in $U$ and $\\Re[f^\\prime] > 1/2$ on $\\bar B_r(z_0)$. Then, by uniform convergence, $\\Re[p_n^\\prime] > 1/2$ on $\\bar B_r(z_0)$ for large $n$. This implies that $\\Re[(p(y)-p(x))/(y-x)] > 1/2$ on the closed ball, so $p_n$ is one-to-one there with derivative $\\lVert p_n^\\prime\\rVert\\ge1/2$. This implies that $p_n(B_r(z_0))$ contains $B_{r/2}(p_n(z_0))$, so $p_n(B_r(z_0))\\supseteq B_{r/3}(f(z_0))$ for large $n$ and there is a unique (analytic) $p_n^{-1}\\colon B_{r/3}(f(z_0))\\to B_r(z_0)$ with $p_n\\circ p_n^{-1}(z)=z$ (by the inverse function theorem ). Choosing an open neighborhood $V$ of $z_0$ such that $f(V)\\subseteq B_{r/3}(f(z_0))$, then the analytic functions $\\phi_n\\colon V\\to U$, $\\phi_n(z)=p_n^{-1}\\circ f(z)$ satisfy the required properties. Now suppose that $f^\\prime(z_0)=0$. Then, there is a $k\\ge0$ with $f^\\prime(z_0)=\\cdots=f^{(k)}(z_0)=0$ and $f^{(k+1)}(z_0)\\not=0$. Subtracting a constant from $f$ and $p_n$ if necessary, we can suppose that $f(z_0)=0$. Then, $f(z)=(z-z_0)^kg(z)$ for an analytic function $g$ on $U$ with $g(z_0)\\not=0$. By assumption, $p_n(z_0)=\\cdots=p_n^{(k)}(z_0)=0$, so we can decompose $p_n(z)=(z-z_0)^kq_n(z)$ where $q_n\\to f$ uniformly on $U$. Then, on some neighborhood of $z_0$, $g$ is nonzero and $q_n$ are nonzero for large $n$. Hence, we can take $k$'th roots to obtain analytic functions $\\tilde f(z)=(z-z_0)g(z)^{1/k}$ and $\\tilde p_n(z)=(z-z_0)q_n(z)^{1/k}$. Furthermore, $\\tilde p_n\\to\\tilde f$ uniformly (so long as we take consistent $k$'th roots for $g$ and $q_n$). We also have $\\tilde f^\\prime(z_0)=g(z_0)^{1/k}\\not=0$. So, by the first case above, there exists an open neighborhood $V$ of $z_0$ and analytic $\\phi_n\\colon V\\to U$ with $\\phi_n(z)\\to z$ uniformly and $\\tilde f=\\tilde p_n\\circ\\phi_n$. Taking $k$'th powers gives $f=p_n\\circ\\phi_n$. Now, by compactness of $K$ and the fact that the analytic functions $\\phi_n$ exist locally as shown above, there exists a finite cover $\\lbrace B_1,\\ldots,B_m\\rbrace$ of $K$, where $B_i$ are open balls in $U$, and analytic functions $\\phi_{in}\\colon B_i\\to U$ satisfying $f=p_n\\circ\\phi_{in}$ on $B_i$ and $\\phi_{in}(z)\\to z$ uniformly as $n\\to\\infty$. For whenever $B_i,B_j$ have non-empty intersection then, as $f$ is non-constant, its derivative will be non-zero at some point $z_0\\in B_i\\cap B_j$ and, wlog, we can suppose that $f^{\\prime}(z_0)=1$. Then, by uniform convergence, there is an open neighborhood $B^\\prime$ of $z_0$ on which $\\Re[p_n^\\prime]\\ge1/2$ for all large $n$ so, as with the argument above, $p_n$ is one-to-one on this neighborhood. As $p_n\\circ\\phi_{in}=p_n\\circ\\phi_{jn}$ this implies that $\\phi_{in}=\\phi_{jn}$ in a neighborhood of $z_0$ whenever $n$ is large enough that $\\phi_{in}(z_0)$ and $\\phi_{jn}(z_0)$ are in $B^\\prime$. By analytic continuation, this gives $\\phi_{in}=\\phi_{jn}$ on $B_i\\cap B_j$. Therefore, with $V=\\cup_iB_i$, we can define analytic $\\phi\\colon V\\to U$ by setting $\\phi=\\phi_{in}$ on $B_i$. Then, $f=p_n\\circ\\phi_n$ and $\\phi_n(z)\\to z$ uniformly. It only remains to show that $\\phi_n$ is one-to-one for large $n$. By uniform convergence of $\\phi_n^\\prime$ to $1$ on any closed ball $\\bar B$ in $V$, we have $\\Re[\\phi^\\prime_n]\\ge1/2$ on $\\bar B$ for large $n$, so $\\phi_n$ is one-to-one on $\\bar B$. So, letting $B_1^\\prime,\\ldots,B_r^\\prime$ be open balls covering $K$ and whose closures are in $V$, $\\phi_n$ is eventually one-to-one on each $B^\\prime_i$. If we let $K^\\prime\\subseteq\\bigcup_iB^\\prime_i$ be a compact set with interior containing $K$, then, by compactness, there is an $\\epsilon > 0$ such that any $x\\not=y\\in K^\\prime$ with $\\lVert x-y\\rVert\\le\\epsilon$ are both contained in some $B^\\prime_i$, so $\\phi_{in}(x)\\not=\\phi_{in}(y)$ for large enough $n$. Alternatively, if $n$ islarge enough that $\\Vert\\phi_n(z)-z\\rVert < \\epsilon/2$ on $V$ then we have $\\lVert\\phi_n(x)-\\phi_n(y)\\rVert\\ge\\epsilon-\\lVert x-y\\rVert\\gt0$ whenever $\\lVert x-y\\rVert\\gt\\epsilon$. So, $\\phi_n$ is one-to-one for large $n$. QED Proof of Lemma 2: As explained in David Speyer's answer, Lagrange interpolation gives a sequence of polynomials $q_n$ converging uniformly to $0$ on compacts (as they are of uniformly bounded degree with coefficients tending to zero) such that, for each $z\\in K$ and $k\\ge1$ with $f^\\prime(z)=\\cdots=f^{(k)}(z)=0$, then $p_n(z)-q_n(z)=f(z)$ and $p_n^\\prime(z)-q_n^\\prime(z)=\\cdots=p_n^{(k)}(z)-q_n^{(k)}(z)=0$. Then, applying Lemma 1 with $p_n-q_n$ in place of $p_n$ gives the result. QED",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what the user is asking. The original problem is a conjecture that every analytic function on the closed unit disk (cl(𝔻)) can be expressed as a polynomial composed with an injective analytic function ϕ from the unit disk 𝔻 to ℂ. The user also mentions that this could extend to other compact sets, but let's focus on the main case.\n\nThe task is to structure this into the specified format: listing assumptions line by line and then stating the problem. The example given shows how assumptions are separated, each addressing one property of a single object.\n\nLooking at the problem: The function f is analytic on cl(𝔻). The conjecture is that there exists an injective analytic function ϕ: 𝔻 → ℂ and a polynomial p such that f = p∘ϕ on 𝔻. The user also asks about terminology.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The key points here are:\n\n1. f is analytic on the closure of the unit disk, cl(𝔻). This means f is analytic not just on the open disk but on some open set containing the closed disk. So the first assumption is that f is analytic on cl(𝔻).\n\n2. ϕ is an injective analytic function from 𝔻 to ℂ. So ϕ: 𝔻 → ℂ is injective and analytic.\n\n3. p is a polynomial. The conjecture claims that f can be written as p composed with ϕ.\n\nWait, but the problem is stating that for any such f, there exists a ϕ and p such that f = p∘ϕ. So the assumptions are about f, ϕ, and p. But in the example, assumptions were about the variables given (like n being integer). Here, the conjecture is for every analytic function f on cl(𝔻), there exists such ϕ and p. So perhaps the main assumption is on f.\n\nBut the format requires assumptions to be listed. The problem is to prove the conjecture, which is that for any f analytic on cl(𝔻), there's a ϕ (injective analytic) and polynomial p with f = p∘ϕ.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- f is analytic on cl(𝔻).\n\nThen the problem is to show there exists ϕ (injective analytic on 𝔻) and polynomial p such that f = p∘ϕ on 𝔻.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the assumption included conditions on the variables. Here, the conjecture is for all f meeting a condition, so the assumption is on f. The existence of ϕ and p is part of the problem statement. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nf is analytic on cl(𝔻),\nϕ is an injective analytic function from 𝔻 to ℂ,\np is a polynomial.\n\nBut wait, no. The problem is that the conjecture is saying \"given f analytic on cl(𝔻), there exists ϕ and p such that...\". So the only assumption here is on f. The existence of ϕ and p is part of the conclusion. So the user's problem is to prove that for any f satisfying the assumption (analytic on cl(𝔻)), such ϕ and p exist.\n\nTherefore, the Assumption part should list the conditions given in the problem that the function f must satisfy. The other parts (ϕ being injective analytic, p being a polynomial) are part of what needs to be proven to exist, so they belong in the problem statement.\n\nWait, the example given in the original query had:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove A(n) is divisible by 91. The user formatted assumptions as n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. So the problem is under those assumptions.\n\nIn this case, the original conjecture is: If f is analytic on cl(𝔻), then there exists ϕ and p such that f = p∘ϕ. So the assumption is just f being analytic on cl(𝔻). The rest is the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the Assumption section should list only the given conditions. So:\n\nAssumption:\nf is analytic on cl(𝔻),\ncl(𝔻) is a simply connected compact set.\n\nWait, but the user's note says \"cl(𝔻) could be replaced by any simply connected compact set.\" But in the problem statement, they specifically mention cl(𝔻). So maybe the assumption is only that f is analytic on cl(𝔻). The replacement part is a note, not part of the problem's assumption. So perhaps the assumption is:\n\n- f is analytic on cl(𝔻).\n\nBut the problem is to find ϕ and p such that f = p∘ϕ. So the structured problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is analytic on cl(𝔻).\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists an injective analytic function ϕ: 𝔻 → ℂ and a polynomial p such that f = p∘ϕ on 𝔻.\n\nBut wait, the original problem's conjecture is phrased as \"if f is analytic on cl(𝔻), then there exists...\", so the assumption is that f is analytic on cl(𝔻), and the problem is to prove the existence of ϕ and p.\n\nAdditionally, the user mentioned that cl(𝔻) could be replaced by any simply connected compact set. But since the problem as stated is about cl(𝔻), the assumption is specific to that. The note is just additional information.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is analytic on cl(𝔻).\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists an injective analytic function ϕ: 𝔻 → ℂ and a polynomial p such that f = p∘ϕ on 𝔻.\n\nBut wait, the example had two assumptions even though the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7. Wait, looking back at the example:\n\nOriginal problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, in the example, the user wrote:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, but that's changing the problem. The original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which would make the problem different. That seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect, but according to the user's provided example, the formatted problem adds assumptions. So perhaps the user wants to split the original problem's conditions into assumptions, even if they are given as universal quantifiers. But that seems odd. Maybe there was a misunderstanding in the example.\n\nBut regardless, in the current problem, the conjecture is that if f is analytic on cl(𝔻), then there exists ϕ and p such that f = p∘ϕ. So the only assumption is that f is analytic on cl(𝔻). The problem is to prove the existence of ϕ and p. Therefore, in the Assumption section, we list:\n\nAssumption:\nf is analytic on the closure of the unit disk cl(𝔻).\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists an injective analytic function ϕ: 𝔻 → ℂ and a polynomial p such that f = p∘ϕ on 𝔻.\n\nAdditionally, the user's note mentions that cl(𝔻) could be replaced by any simply connected compact set. But since the problem as stated is about cl(𝔻), that's the assumption. If the user wants to include that replaceability, maybe that's part of the problem statement. But the original problem's conjecture is about cl(𝔻). The note is an additional comment. So perhaps not part of the structured problem.\n\nMoreover, the user mentions replacing \"simply connected\" with \"finitely connected\" and \"polynomial\" with \"rational function\", but again, that's part of the note, not the main problem. So the main assumption is f analytic on cl(𝔻).\n\nAnother point: The problem states \"analytic on some open set containing cl(𝔻)\". So perhaps the assumption is f is analytic on an open set containing cl(𝔻). The closure of 𝔻 is compact, so being analytic on an open set containing it is necessary for certain analytic continuation properties.\n\nTherefore, the precise assumption is:\n\nf is analytic on an open set containing cl(𝔻).\n\nSo the correct assumption is that f is analytic in a neighborhood of cl(𝔻). That's important because analyticity on the closed disk isn't standard unless specified as on an open set containing it. So the problem's first line says: \"If $f$ is analytic on $\\text{cl}(\\mathbb{D})$ (that is, analytic on some open set containing $\\text{cl}(\\mathbb{D})$)\", which translates to f being analytic on an open set containing cl(𝔻). Therefore, the assumption should be written as:\n\nf is analytic on an open set containing cl(𝔻).\n\nTherefore, putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nf is analytic on an open set containing the closure of the unit disk cl(𝔻).\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists an injective analytic function ϕ: 𝔻 → ℂ and a polynomial p such that f = p∘ϕ on 𝔻.\n\nThe user also asks about terminology (\"PS: I would then say that f and p are conformally equivalent. Is there a better term for this relationship?\"), but that's part of the question, not the problem to be structured. The task is to structure the problem part, not the additional questions. So in the Problem section, only the mathematical problem is included.\n\nSo the final structured problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is analytic on an open set containing cl(𝔻).\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists an injective analytic function ϕ: 𝔻 → ℂ and a polynomial p such that f = p∘ϕ on 𝔻.\n\nAlternatively, if \"open set containing cl(𝔻)\" is considered one condition applied to f, then the assumption is one line. Also, check if the original problem uses \"cl(𝔻)\" as being analytic on cl(𝔻), which is defined as being analytic on an open set containing cl(𝔻). So the assumption is that f is analytic on cl(𝔻) in that sense.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem is as above.",
