    "Content": "Let $\\{E_n\\}_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence of countable sets and let $S=E_1\\times\\cdots\\times E_n\\times\\cdots $. Show $S$ is uncountable. Prove that the same statement holds if each $E_n=\\{0,1\\}$. By the definition of Cartesian product of sets, $$\\displaystyle S=\\Pi_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}} \\{f\\colon\\mathbb{N}\\rightarrow\\cup_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}E_n\\mid\\forall n, f(n)\\in E_n\\}$$ If $E_n=\\{ 0,1\\}$, then $$\\displaystyle S_{01}=\\Pi_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}\\{0,1\\}=E^{\\mathbb{N}}$$, where $E=\\{0,1\\}$. By a theorem, $\\cup_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}} E_n$ is countable since the sequence is countable. I'm not sure how to go on from here to show $S$ is uncountable. Can we say anything about the function $f$ that maps a countable $\\mathbb{N}$ to another countable union of sequence of countable sets?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You can reproduce Cantor's diagonal trick for both problems. Suppose $S$ is countable. Let $(F_n: n\\in\\mathbb N)$ be an enumeration of $S$. For each $n$,pick two points $a_n,b_n\\in E_n$. Then define a new function $F\\in S$ as follows: $$F(m)= \\begin{cases} b_m &\\mbox{if } F_m(m)=a_m \\\\ a_m & \\mbox{otherwise } \\end{cases}$$\nIt follows that $F\\in S$ but it is different of all $F_n$'s which is a contradiction.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So the task is to show that the infinite Cartesian product of countable sets is uncountable. The specific case given is when each E_n is {0,1}, and we need to prove that S, which is the product of these E_n's, is uncountable.\n\nFirst, I remember that for finite products, if each set is countable, then the product is also countable. But when it's an infinite product, things might be different. The classic example is the set of all infinite binary sequences, which is uncountable, as shown by Cantor's diagonal argument. So maybe this problem is a generalization of that idea.\n\nThe original problem mentions a sequence of countable sets {E_n} and their product S. The user wants to show that S is uncountable. Then there's the specific case where each E_n is {0,1}, which should be similar to the binary sequences example.\n\nThe user also mentioned the definition of the Cartesian product as functions from N to the union of E_n such that each f(n) is in E_n. For the case where E_n = {0,1}, this product becomes the set of all functions from N to {0,1}, which is equivalent to the set of all infinite binary sequences. As per Cantor's theorem, this set is uncountable. But the general case where each E_n is countable might need a different approach or a similar diagonalization argument.\n\nWait, but if each E_n is countable, then each has at least two elements? No, countable can mean finite or countably infinite. But the problem states \"countable sets\", so maybe they are all countably infinite. Wait, but in the specific case, each E_n is {0,1}, which is finite. So the problem allows E_n to be finite or countably infinite. So the question is, even if some E_n are finite, as long as infinitely many are non-singleton, then the product is uncountable.\n\nBut how to approach this? The user is confused because they know that the union of countable sets is countable, but the product is different. The key is that the product's cardinality is not determined by the cardinality of the individual sets but by how many choices there are at each position. If infinitely many E_n have at least two elements, then the product is uncountable. That might be a theorem.\n\nBut the problem here states that all E_n are countable, but maybe at least two elements each? Wait, no, in the example, they have E_n = {0,1}, which has two elements each. So perhaps the problem assumes that each E_n has at least two elements. But the original problem statement as presented by the user doesn't specify that. Wait, the problem says \"Let {E_n} be a sequence of countable sets\" and then \"Show S is uncountable\". But if all E_n are singleton sets, then their product would be a singleton, which is countable. So there must be an implicit assumption that each E_n has at least two elements, or that infinitely many do.\n\nWait, the problem as stated in the user's question: \"Let {E_n}_{n∈ℕ} be a sequence of countable sets and let S = E₁×⋯×E_n×⋯. Show S is uncountable. Prove that the same statement holds if each E_n={0,1}.\"\n\nBut the initial problem as stated by the user might be incorrect. Because if all E_n are countable, but perhaps some are singletons, then the product could be countable. For example, if E_n = {0} for all n, then the product is a singleton. So the problem must have an additional condition, like each E_n has at least two elements, or infinitely many E_n have at least two elements. Otherwise, the statement isn't true.\n\nWait, but the user's problem says \"the same statement holds if each E_n={0,1}\". So in that case, each E_n has two elements. So maybe the original problem intended that each E_n is countable and has at least two elements. But the user's original problem statement doesn't mention that. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, maybe the user misstated the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct as stated, but the solution requires that each E_n is countably infinite. Wait, but {0,1} is finite, so the second part would still need to be handled.\n\nThis suggests that the problem as posed by the user might have an error, but assuming that the problem is correctly stated, perhaps there's an implicit assumption. Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct as is, and the user's confusion is because they need to find that even with countable sets, the product is uncountable. But that's not necessarily true. Wait, the standard result is that the product of countably many countable sets is uncountable if each has at least two elements. Otherwise, if infinitely many have at least two, then the product is uncountable.\n\nBut the problem states that \"Let {E_n} be a sequence of countable sets\" and \"show S is uncountable\". If all E_n are countable, but maybe with at least two elements each, then the product is uncountable. So perhaps the problem assumes that each E_n is countably infinite. Wait, but {0,1} is finite. So the problem must have an error. Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, but the answer is that it's not necessarily uncountable unless each E_n has at least two elements. Therefore, perhaps the problem is incorrectly stated, but the user wants to proceed with the assumption that each E_n has at least two elements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended that each E_n is countably infinite. But in the second part, E_n is {0,1}, which is finite. So that's conflicting. Therefore, I think the problem as stated is incorrect. However, the standard problem is that if each E_n is finite with at least two elements, then the product is uncountable. Similarly, if each E_n is countably infinite, then the product is uncountable. But in the problem as stated, it's \"countable sets\", which can be finite or countably infinite. So unless at least infinitely many E_n are non-singleton, the product could be countable.\n\nBut given that the user is asking this, and in the example, when E_n = {0,1}, the product is uncountable, perhaps the intended problem is that each E_n has at least two elements. Therefore, in structuring the problem, the assumptions should include that each E_n is countable and has at least two elements, or that infinitely many E_n have at least two elements. However, the original problem as presented by the user doesn't state that. But the example in the problem has E_n = {0,1}, which has two elements, so maybe the problem assumes each E_n has at least two elements. Therefore, the assumption should include that each E_n is countable and has at least two elements. Otherwise, the statement is not true.\n\nBut the user's original problem says \"sequence of countable sets\" and then says \"show S is uncountable\". So without additional conditions, this is false. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem statement, but in the formatted problem, we need to list the assumptions correctly.\n\nGiven the example provided by the user where in the original problem, the assumption was that n is divisible by 7, but in the problem statement, the user had written \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added the assumption that n is divisible by 7. Therefore, perhaps in this case, the correct assumptions are that each E_n is a countable set with at least two elements.\n\nBut since the problem statement from the user says \"the same statement holds if each E_n={0,1}\", which is a finite set with two elements. Therefore, the key assumption is that each E_n is a countable set with at least two elements. Alternatively, if infinitely many E_n have at least two elements, then the product is uncountable.\n\nBut the user's problem doesn't specify this. So to structure the problem correctly, perhaps the assumptions should include that each E_n is a countable set with at least two elements, or that infinitely many E_n have at least two elements. But since the user's original problem states the problem as given, maybe we need to infer the necessary assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is correct as stated, and the user needs to show that even if each E_n is countable, the product is uncountable. But that's not true. For example, if each E_n is a singleton, then the product is a singleton. Therefore, the problem must have an implicit assumption that each E_n has at least two elements.\n\nTherefore, when structuring the problem, the assumptions should be:\n\n- For each n ∈ ℕ, E_n is a countable set.\n- For each n ∈ ℕ, E_n has at least two elements.\n\nThen the problem is to show that S = Π_{n∈ℕ} E_n is uncountable. And then also prove the same when each E_n = {0,1}.\n\nBut the original problem statement by the user doesn't mention the \"at least two elements\" part. So this is an assumption that needs to be included for the problem to hold true. Otherwise, the statement is false.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have the assumptions that each E_n is countable and has at least two elements. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that each E_n is countably infinite, which would also make the product uncountable, but in the specific case, E_n is finite, so that assumption wouldn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is misstated, and the user intended to assume that each E_n is non-empty, but that's not sufficient.\n\nHmm. The example given in the problem was about divisibility by 91, where the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted version added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which actually changes the problem. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added the assumption that n is divisible by 7, which seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the user provided an incorrect example. Because in the original problem, A(n) =5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n). The user's formatted problem added the assumption that n is divisible by 7. But the actual solution would require that 91 divides A(n) for all integers n, which is true because 91=13*7, and the expression is divisible by both 7 and 13 for any n. So the example given by the user is incorrect because the assumption that n is divisible by 7 is not necessary. Hence, the user's example might be flawed, but that's a separate issue.\n\nTherefore, returning to the current problem. To structure the problem correctly, we need to list the assumptions that make the problem statement true. The problem as stated by the user is incorrect as written because without additional conditions, the product of countable sets can be countable. Therefore, the necessary assumptions are that each E_n is a countable set with at least two elements. This would make the product uncountable. Alternatively, if infinitely many E_n have at least two elements, then the product is uncountable. But since in the specific case each E_n is {0,1}, which has two elements, so the assumption should be that each E_n has at least two elements.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should include the assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\nEach E_n is a countable set,\nEach E_n has at least two elements.\n\nProblem:\nShow that S = E₁ × E₂ × ⋯ is uncountable. Prove that the same statement holds if each E_n = {0,1}.\n\nBut the user's original problem states \"sequence of countable sets\" and then the specific case with E_n={0,1}. Therefore, the key is to recognize that for the product to be uncountable, each E_n must have at least two elements. Hence, the assumptions should include that each E_n is countable and has at least two elements.\n\nTherefore, after filtering the unnecessary information from the user's question (like the definition of Cartesian product, the mention of the union being countable, etc.), the structured problem should list the necessary assumptions and the problem statement.",
