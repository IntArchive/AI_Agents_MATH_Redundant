    "Content": "I can't find the missing link between singularity and zero eigenvalues as is stated in the following proposition: A matrix $A$ is singular if and only if $0$ is an eigenvalue. Could anyone shed some light?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "We know that $0 \\in \\lambda(A)$ iff there exists some nonzero solution to the eigenvector equation $Ax = \\lambda x = 0\\cdot x = 0$. Thus $0$ is an eigenvalue iff $\\exists b \\in \\mathrm{Ker}(A)$ with $b \\neq 0$. But since $\\mathrm{Ker}(A) \\neq \\{ 0 \\}$ we conclude that  $A$ must be singular.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. The user wants to show that a matrix A is singular if and only if 0 is an eigenvalue. Hmm, first, I need to recall the definitions.\n\nA singular matrix is one that doesn't have an inverse, which happens when its determinant is zero. On the other hand, an eigenvalue λ of A satisfies det(A - λI) = 0. So, if 0 is an eigenvalue, then det(A - 0I) = det(A) = 0, which means A is singular. That seems straightforward for one direction.\n\nFor the converse, if A is singular, then det(A) = 0. But det(A) is the product of its eigenvalues. If the product is zero, at least one eigenvalue must be zero. So, that would imply 0 is an eigenvalue. Wait, but does that cover all cases? Like, even for non-diagonalizable matrices? Maybe I should think in terms of the characteristic equation. The eigenvalues are roots of the characteristic polynomial det(A - λI) = 0. If det(A) = 0, then substituting λ = 0 gives det(A) = 0, so 0 is a root, hence an eigenvalue. Yeah, that works.\n\nSo putting it together: If A is singular ⇨ det(A)=0 ⇨ 0 is an eigenvalue. Conversely, if 0 is an eigenvalue ⇨ det(A)=0 ⇨ A is singular. Therefore, the equivalence holds. The key steps are linking singularity to determinant being zero, and determinant to eigenvalues via the characteristic equation. I think that covers both directions. The user might have been confused about how exactly the determinant connects to eigenvalues, especially in the 'if and only if' scenario. Making sure both implications are addressed should clarify the missing link.",
