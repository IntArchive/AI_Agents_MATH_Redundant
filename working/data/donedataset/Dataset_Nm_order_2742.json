    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that I need to list all assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object, and then state the problem clearly.\n\nLooking at the original problem from the example: the user mentioned that in the formatted problem, the assumption includes that \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the original problem, it says \"for every integer n\", which doesn't restrict n to being divisible by 7. Hmm, maybe the example had a different context or maybe there was a mistake. But regardless, I need to follow the user's example structure.\n\nNow, the current problem given is from Math Stack Exchange titled: \"How to prove that \\( \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{N} } | \\frac{\\sin( n)}{n} | \\) diverges?\" The question mentions it's from Spivak's Calculus and the user is confused.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem is about proving the divergence of the series \\( \\sum |\\sin(n)/n| \\). The series is over natural numbers n. The assumptions here would be related to the properties of the terms of the series. Let's think:\n\n1. The summation is over all natural numbers n. So one assumption is that n is a natural number (n ∈ ℕ).\n2. The terms of the series are |sin(n)/n|. Each term is the absolute value of sin(n) divided by n.\n3. The problem is to show that the series diverges, i.e., the sum tends to infinity.\n\nWait, the example had specific conditions like divisibility, but here the problem doesn't have explicit conditions except that n is a natural number. So the main assumptions here are that n is in the natural numbers, and the series is defined as the sum of |sin(n)/n|. Are there any hidden assumptions? For instance, in Spivak's problem, maybe there's a context that n is in radians? Since trigonometric functions in calculus are typically in radians unless stated otherwise. That's an important assumption because if sin(n) were in degrees, the behavior would be different. So that's another assumption: angles are measured in radians.\n\nBut does the original problem state that? The user's question just says \"It is stated as a problem in Spivak's Calculus...\". Spivak's Calculus usually uses radians, so that's a safe assumption. Therefore, the assumptions would include that sin(n) is computed in radians.\n\nSo putting this all together:\n\nAssumption:\nEach term of the series is |sin(n)/n| where n is a natural number,\nThe sine function is evaluated in radians,\nThe summation is over all natural numbers n.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the series \\( \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{N} } | \\frac{\\sin( n)}{n} | \\) diverges.\n\nWait, but in the example, each assumption was a single line addressing one property. So \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are separate. Here, maybe split into:\n\n- n is a natural number (n ∈ ℕ),\n- The sine function is evaluated in radians,\n- The series is ∑_{n ∈ ℕ} |sin(n)/n|.\n\nBut the problem is to prove divergence. So the formatted problem would list these assumptions and then the problem statement.\n\nI should check if there are more assumptions. For example, maybe convergence/divergence is considered in the standard real number system, but that's probably too implicit. The key points are the terms of the series, the domain of n, and the sine function's argument in radians.\n\nAnother thing: The original problem in the example had an error because the user mentioned \"for every integer n\" but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". Maybe the example was a specific case, but in the current problem, we don't have such restrictions. So we just list the necessary assumptions.\n\nSo the final answer should be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a natural number,\nThe sine function is evaluated in radians,\nEach term of the series is |sin(n)/n|,\nThe summation is over all n ∈ ℕ.\n\nProblem:\nProve that \\( \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\left| \\frac{\\sin(n)}{n} \\right| \\) diverges.\n\nWait, but in the example, each assumption was a separate line. Let me structure it accordingly.",
