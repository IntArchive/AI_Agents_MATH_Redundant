    "Content": "Denote $F_2$ the free non-abelian group on two letters $a, b$. Note that any element in $F_2$ is just a word formed by letters from the set $\\{a,b,a^{-1},b^{-1}\\}$, and the group structure is given by word concatenation, i.e., $(aba^{-1})(a^2b)=abab$. I want to prove that: For any $\\{x_g\\}_{g\\in F_2}\\in \\mathbb{C}$ with $\\sum_{g\\in F_2}|x_g|^2=1$, we have $|\\sum_{g\\in F_2}x_g\\overline{x_{ag}}|^2$ or $|\\sum_{g\\in F_2}x_g\\overline{x_{bg}}|^2\\leq \\frac{1}{2}$. Here, $ag$ ( or $bg$ ) denote the concatenation of $a, g$ ( or $b, g$ )in $F_2$, and $\\overline{x_g}$ is the usual conjugation of complex numbers. Could anyone help prove this or give a counterexample? ( Added ) Here are some simple observations: Denote $S=support(x)=\\{g\\in F_2|x_g\\neq 0\\}$, and note that we have a disjoint union (or partition) $$F_2=\\{e\\}\\cup S_a\\cup S_{a^{-1}}\\cup S_b\\cup S_{b^{-1}}$$ where $e$ denotes the empty word in $F_2$, $S_a$ denotes the subset of all words (in reduced form) in $F_2$ that start with letter $a$, $S_{a^{-1}}, S_b, S_{b^{-1}}$ are defined similarly. Then, suppose $aS\\cap bS=\\emptyset$, then it is clear $$|\\sum_{g\\in F_2}x_g\\overline{x_{ag}}|^2\\leq (\\sum_{g\\in F_2}|x_g|^2)(\\sum_{g\\in F_2}|x_{ag}|^2)\\leq \\sum_{g\\in F_2}|x_{ag}|^2= \\sum_{g\\in aS}|x_g|^2 $$ $$|\\sum_{g\\in F_2}x_g\\overline{x_{bg}}|^2\\leq (\\sum_{g\\in F_2}|x_g|^2)(\\sum_{g\\in F_2}|x_{bg}|^2)\\leq \\sum_{g\\in F_2}|x_{bg}|^2= \\sum_{g\\in bS}|x_g|^2 $$ since $aS\\cap bS=\\emptyset$, $\\sum_{g\\in aS}|x_g|^2 +\\sum_{g\\in bS}|x_g|^2\\leq \\sum_{g\\in F_2}|x_g|^2=1$, so the claim holds. Note that if $S\\subset S_a\\cup S_b\\cup\\{e\\}$, then $aS\\cap bS=\\emptyset$ holds by considering the first letter is a word; but in general, $aS\\cup bS\\neq \\emptyset$ can happen, for example, if $S\\subset S_{a^{-1}}$, then\n$aS\\cup bS\\neq \\emptyset$ iff $S$ contains some reduced words of the form $a^{-1}ba^{-1}t, a^{-1}t$. (Using the fact $a(a^{-1}ba^{-1}t)=b(a^{-1}t)$). Similarly, you can find a result when $S\\subset S_{b^{-1}}$. Based on the above simple observations, clearly, this problem involves very complicated stuff on combinatorics and inequality estimate, I get stuck in proving the general case, i.e., $S=support(x)$ is arbitrary set of $F_2$. So I believe if the claim holds in general, then there should be some advanced theory behind it that I do not know, perhaps group cohomology method etc. Note also that the claim can be thought as a claim on the upper norm bound gap (since it is clear that both are no bigger than 1 by Cauchy-Schwarz inequality), so maybe some known rigidity result might be helpful to this problem, but still, I have no idea how to proceed the argument.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This counterexample seems to work for $\\frac{1}{2}$, and beyond: $$x_g:=Cr^{\\ell(g)}\\qquad\\forall g\\in F_2$$ for the right choices of constants $$C>0\\qquad\\mbox{and}\\qquad 0\\leq r<\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}.$$ Here $\\ell(g)$ denotes the word length of the element $g$, i.e. the minimal number of letters needed in the alphabet $\\{a,a^{-1},b,b^{-1}\\}$ to write it down. First note that there is one element of length $0$, i.e. $1$. There are $4$ elements of length $1$, i.e. $a,a^{-1},b,b^{-1}$. And more generally, there are $4\\cdot 3^{n-1}$ elements of length $n$. Indeed, writing them without allowing cancellations from left to right, there are $4$ choices for the first letter, and then only $3$ choices for each additional letter. With $x$ defined as above, note that $0\\leq 3r^2<1$ so\n$$\n\\sum_{g\\in F_2}|x_g|^2=C^2\\sum_{g\\in F_2}r^{2\\ell(g)}=C^2(1+\\sum_{n\\geq 1}\\sum_{\\ell(g)=n}r^{2n})=C^2(1+\\sum_{n\\geq 1}4\\cdot3^{n-1}r^{2n})\n$$\n$$\n=C^2\\left(1+\\frac{4}{3}\\frac{3r^2}{1-3r^2}\\right)=C^2\\frac{1+r^2}{1-3r^2}.\n$$\nSo $$C:=\\sqrt{\\frac{1-3r^2}{1+r^2}}\\quad\\mbox{yields}\\quad \\sum_{g\\in F_2}|x_g|^2=1$$ as desired. Now we compute \n$$\\sum_{g\\in F_2}x_g\\overline{x_{ag}}=C^2\\left(r+\\sum_{n\\geq 1}\\sum_{\\ell(g)=n}r^{\\ell(g)+\\ell(ag)}\\right).\n$$\nObserve that the elements of length $n$ split into two disjoint sets: 1) $3^{n-1}$ elements starting with $a^{-1}$ and such that $\\ell(ag)=n-1$. 2) $3\\cdot 3^{n-1}=3^n$ elements starting with $a,b,$ or $b^{-1}$ and such that $\\ell(ag)=n+1$. Hence\n$$\nr+\\sum_{n\\geq 1}\\sum_{\\ell(g)=n}r^{\\ell(g)+\\ell(ag)}=r+\\sum_{n\\geq 1}3^{n-1}r^{2n-1}+\\sum_{n\\geq 1}3^{n}r^{2n+1}\n$$\n$$\n=r+\\left(\\frac{1}{3r}+r\\right)\\sum_{n\\geq 1}(3r^2)^n=r+\\left(\\frac{1}{3r}+r\\right)\\frac{3r^2}{1-3r^2}=\\frac{2r}{1-3r^2}.\n$$\nSo\n$$\n\\sum_{g\\in F_2}x_g\\overline{x_{ag}}=C^2 \\frac{2r}{1-3r^2}=\\frac{2r}{1+r^2}\n$$\nFor symmetry reasons, we find the same sum for $\\sum_{g\\in F_2}x_g\\overline{x_{bg}}$. Therefore $$\\left|\\sum_{g\\in F_2}x_g\\overline{x_{ag}}\\right|^2=\n\\left|\\sum_{g\\in F_2}x_g\\overline{x_{bg}}\\right|^2=\\left(\\frac{2r}{1+r^2} \\right)^2\\qquad \\mbox{with}\\quad 0\\leq r<\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}. $$ Now \n$$\n\\lim_{r\\rightarrow \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}}\\left(\\frac{2r}{1+r^2} \\right)^2=\\frac{3}{4}.\n$$\nAnd to be more precise, this rational function is increasing on $(0,1/\\sqrt{3})$. So we get a counterexample to your conjecture for $r$ close enough to the left of $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$. And actually, we get a stronger result: for every $\\alpha < \\frac{3}{4}$ there exists $x$ of norm $1$ which violates the inequalities: $$\\forall \\alpha<\\frac{3}{4}\\qquad\\exists \\sum_{g\\in F_2}|x_g|^2=1\\qquad\n\\left|\\sum_{g\\in F_2}x_g\\overline{x_{ag}}\\right|^2=\n\\left|\\sum_{g\\in F_2}x_g\\overline{x_{bg}}\\right|^2>\\alpha.$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants to prove an inequality involving sequences in l² space over the free group F₂. The problem states that for any complex sequence {x_g} with the sum of squares equal to 1, either the square of the sum involving x_g and x_{ag} or the one with x_g and x_{bg} is at most 1/2. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The original problem mentions several things: F₂ is the free non-abelian group on a and b, elements are words with letters from {a, b, a⁻¹, b⁻¹}, group operation is concatenation. The variables {x_g} are in ℂ, the sum of |x_g|² is 1. The problem is about showing that either the square of the sum over x_g conjugate x_{ag} or the same with bg is ≤ 1/2.\n\nSo the assumptions here are:\n\n1. F₂ is the free non-abelian group generated by a and b.\n2. Each element of F₂ is a reduced word from the alphabet {a, b, a⁻¹, b⁻¹}.\n3. The group operation is concatenation followed by reduction.\n4. {x_g} is a sequence in ℂ.\n5. The sum of |x_g|² over all g in F₂ is 1.\n6. The problem is to show that either |sum x_g conjugate x_{ag}|² or |sum x_g conjugate x_{bg}|² is ≤ 1/2.\n\nWait, but in the example given by the user, they had to extract assumptions that are single properties applied to one object. Let me check the example again. The example had assumptions like \"n is an integer\", \"n is divisible by 7\". Each is a separate line, each addressing one property of a single object.\n\nIn this problem, the main objects are F₂, the group elements, the sequence {x_g}, and the sums. So breaking down:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- F₂ is the free non-abelian group generated by a and b. (This is one property of F₂)\n- Each element of F₂ is a reduced word over the alphabet {a, b, a⁻¹, b⁻¹}. (Another property of F₂ elements)\n- The group operation in F₂ is concatenation followed by reduction if necessary. (This is a property of the group operation)\n- {x_g}_{g ∈ F₂} is a sequence of complex numbers. (Property of x_g)\n- The sum of |x_g|² over all g in F₂ equals 1. (Condition on the sequence)\n- The problem involves proving an inequality on either |Σ x_g \\overline{x_{ag}}|² or |Σ x_g \\overline{x_{bg}}|² being ≤ 1/2. (But wait, the problem itself is the statement to prove, so the assumptions are the given conditions. The problem is to prove the inequality.)\n\nSo, structuring the assumptions as per the user's example, each line is one assumption, one property per line, applied to one object.\n\nLet me list them:\n\nAssumption:\n$F_2$ is the free non-abelian group on two letters $a$ and $b$,\nEach element of $F_2$ is a reduced word over the set $\\{a, b, a^{-1}, b^{-1}\\}$,\nThe group operation in $F_2$ is concatenation followed by reduction,\n$\\{x_g\\}_{g \\in F_2}$ is a sequence in $\\mathbb{C}$,\n$\\sum_{g \\in F_2} |x_g|^2 = 1$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $|\\sum_{g \\in F_2} x_g \\overline{x_{ag}}|^2$ or $|\\sum_{g \\in F_2} x_g \\overline{x_{bg}}|^2 \\leq \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user mentioned that the problem is to prove that either of these two quantities is ≤1/2. So the problem statement is correctly captured here.\n\nBut let me check again the original question:\n\n\"For any {x_g}_{g ∈ F₂} ∈ ℂ with sum |x_g|²=1, we have |sum x_g \\overline{x_{ag}}|² or |sum x_g \\overline{x_{bg}}|² ≤1/2.\"\n\nYes, that's the problem. The assumptions would include the properties of F₂, the sequence being in ℂ, the sum of squares being 1, etc.\n\nSo, in the formatted problem, the assumptions are the given conditions, each as a separate line. The problem is the statement to prove.\n\nSo I think this captures all the necessary assumptions. The example the user gave for the divisibility problem included two assumptions: n is integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions are about the group, the elements, the sequence, and the normalization of the sum.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be as above.",
