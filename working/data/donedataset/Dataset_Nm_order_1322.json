    "Content": "This is a question from a qualifying exam. Let $X$ be a compact, oriented $n$-dimensional manifold. Show that for any $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, there exists a continuous map $f: X \\to S^n$ of degree $k$. I was pleased with the very nice solution via suspensions at For every $k \\in {\\mathbb Z}$ construct a continuous map $f: S^n \\to S^n$ with $\\deg(f) = k$. in the case where $X = S^n$. It seems that for this question, it should suffice to show that there exists a degree $\\pm 1$ map from $X$ to $S^n$, and then we can compose with a degree $\\pm k$ self-map of $S^n$ to get a degree $k$ map from $X$ to $S^n$ (because the degree of a composition of maps is the product of the degrees of the component maps). One idea I've had so far is to consider an embedding $X \\to \\mathbb{R}^N \\backslash \\{0\\}$ for some large $N$ and then project onto the $n$-sphere, but I do not know how one would guarantee that this would have degree 1. And while this isn't necessary to answer the question, what would a degree 1 map $T^2 \\to S^2$ even look like? I cannot easily visualize such a map. EDIT: To answer my own question about a degree 1 map $T^2 \\to S^2$ that is slightly less `singular' than Jared's answer below: imagining the sphere and torus as their nice looking ball and doughnut shapes, just place the sphere inside of the torus (i.e. in the tube itself, not at its center of mass) and then project the the torus onto the sphere.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here is an answer that uses more abstract machinery. Let $B \\subset X$ be an open set homeomorphic to an open ball in $\\Bbb R^n$. Let $p : X \\to X / (X - B)$ be the quotient map. We have $X/(X - B) = S^n$. By the naturality of the long exact sequence, we have the commutative diagram:\n$$\n\\require{AMScd}\n\\begin{CD}\nH_n(X) @>\\cong>> H_n(X, X - B)\\\\\n@VVq_*V @VV\\cong V \\\\\nH_n(X / (X - B)) @>\\cong>> H_n(X / (X - B), (X - B) / (X - B))\n\\end{CD}\n$$ The upper map is an isomorphism since $X$ is orientable. The right map is an isomorphism by excision (see Hatcher's Algebraic Topology, 2.22). The lower map is an isomorphism since $(X - B) / (X - B)$ is a single point. It follows that $q_*$ is an isomorphism. Hence $q$ has degree one as desired.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify the key assumptions and the problem statement. The original question is about showing that for any integer k, there's a continuous map from a compact oriented n-dimensional manifold X to the n-sphere S^n with degree k.\n\nThe example provided shows that assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property of a single object. Let's look at the problem again. The user mentions that X is a compact, oriented n-dimensional manifold. So the assumptions should include that. Also, the problem wants a map of any integer degree k. The example in the user's thought process involved breaking down the problem into showing a degree ±1 map exists and then composing with self-maps of the sphere.\n\nWait, the original problem states X is compact and oriented, and n-dimensional. So the assumptions are:\n\n1. X is a compact manifold.\n2. X is an oriented manifold.\n3. The dimension of X is n.\n4. k is an integer.\n\nBut in the example given by the user, the assumptions were n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Each assumption is a single condition on one object. Here, the problem doesn't state any divisibility on k, just that it's an integer. X has three properties: compact, oriented, n-dimensional. Each should be separate lines. So:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a compact manifold,\nX is an oriented manifold,\nX has dimension n,\nk is an integer.\n\nThen the problem is to show there exists a continuous map f: X → S^n with degree k.\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"for any k in Z\", so k is arbitrary integer. The problem statement in the formatted version should probably include \"for any k ∈ Z\" to reflect that. But in the example, the problem was restated concisely. Let me check the user's example again. The original problem said \"for every integer n\", and in the formatted problem, the assumption was n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. The problem then says \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\". So in the example, the problem statement doesn't repeat the \"for every integer n\" because that's in the assumption. Similarly, here, the problem statement would be \"Show that there exists a continuous map f: X → S^n of degree k.\" Since the assumption includes k is an integer, but the problem is for any k (since k is given as arbitrary in Z, but the assumption lists k is an integer). Wait, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", and the formatted problem's assumption was n is an integer, and n divisible by 7, and the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. So in that case, the \"for every integer n\" was transformed into \"n is an integer\" in the assumption, but then added another condition. Here, the problem is \"for any k ∈ Z\", so in the assumptions, we list \"k is an integer\", and the problem is to show existence for that k. So the problem statement would be \"Show that there exists a continuous map f: X → S^n of degree k.\" The \"for any k\" is covered by the assumption that k is an integer. Wait, but in the example, the original problem's \"for every integer n\" became an assumption \"n is an integer\", and the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. So in that case, the universality (\"for every\") is captured in the assumption. Similarly here, the problem is \"for any k ∈ Z\", so the assumption would be \"k is an integer\", and the problem is to show existence of a map with degree k. So that's correct.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a compact manifold,\nX is an oriented manifold,\nX has dimension n,\nk is an integer.\n\nProblem: Show that there exists a continuous map f: X → S^n of degree k.\n\nBut the original problem says \"for any k ∈ Z\", so maybe the problem should say \"for any integer k, show...\", but according to the example, the \"for every integer n\" was moved into the assumption as \"n is an integer\", and the problem was \"prove A(n) is divisible by 91\". So following that structure, the problem here is \"Show that there exists a continuous map f: X → S^n of degree k.\" with the assumption that k is an integer.\n\nBut perhaps the original problem's exact wording is \"for any k ∈ Z\", which is \"for any integer k\", so the assumption is \"k is an integer\", and the problem is to show existence of such a map for that k. So the problem statement doesn't need to repeat \"for any k\", because that's covered by the assumption that k is an integer. But maybe the problem statement should still include \"for any integer k\", but according to the example, it's not necessary. Let me check the example again. Original problem: \"Prove that for every integer n...\", formatted problem: Assumption includes \"n is an integer\", problem: \"Prove that A(n)...\". So in that case, the \"for every\" is moved to the assumption. But in the problem statement, it's just \"Prove that A(n) is...\", assuming that n is given as per the assumption. So here, similarly, the problem would be \"Show that there exists a continuous map f: X → S^n of degree k.\" with the assumption that k is an integer. So that's acceptable.\n\nAdditionally, the original problem mentions that X is compact, oriented, n-dimensional. So those are all separate assumptions. Each on their own line. So the assumptions are:\n\n- X is a compact manifold\n- X is an oriented manifold\n- X has dimension n\n- k is an integer\n\nThe problem is then to show existence of a map f: X→S^n with degree k.\n\nI think that's correct. The user's example had two assumptions for n, so here we have four assumptions. Each is a single condition on one object. Yes. For example, \"X is a compact manifold\" is one condition on X. \"X is an oriented manifold\" is another condition on X. \"X has dimension n\" is a third condition on X. \"k is an integer\" is a condition on k. So that's four separate lines.\n\nSo the final formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a compact manifold,\nX is an oriented manifold,\nX has dimension n,\nk is an integer.\n\nProblem: Show that there exists a continuous map \\( f: X \\to S^n \\) of degree \\( k \\).\n\nI need to make sure that no other assumptions are mentioned. The original problem didn't specify anything else. The user's thoughts mentioned embedding into R^N and projecting, but those are part of the attempt, not the problem's assumptions. So the problem's assumptions are only the properties of X and k as given in the problem statement. Therefore, this should be correct.",
