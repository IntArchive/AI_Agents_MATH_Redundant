    "Content": "I have seen a handful of proofs that any finitely generated module over a Noetherian ring is again Noetherian. I'm specifically trying to understand the following proof idea. It goes as this: Observe that if $T\\subseteq S$ are submodules of an $R$-module $M$ with $R$ Noetherian, and if $T$ is finitely generated (f.g.) and $S/T$ is f.g., then so is $S$. I get that. Proceed by induction. If $M$ is $1$-generated, say $M=Rv$, then if $\\phi\\colon R\\to M$ defined by $r\\mapsto rv$ is an epimorphism, and so $M\\cong R/\\ker(\\phi)$, and is Noetherian as the quotient of a Noetherian ring. Suppose it holds for all $k$-generated $R$-modules, for $k\\leq n$. Let $M=\\langle v_1,\\dots,v_{n+1}\\rangle$. Let $M'=\\langle v_1,\\dots, v_n\\rangle$. Then let $T=S\\cap M'$. On second thought, I think $S$ is supposed to be an arbitrary submodule of $M$. Let $T=S\\cap M'$. So $T$ is a submodule of $M'$, hence finitely generated. Then\n$$\nS/T=S/(S\\cap M')\\cong (S+M')/M'.\n$$\nHow is $(S+M')/M'$ finitely generated? I suppose would give the conclusion.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I assume that $S$ is a submodule of $M$ and you want to prove that $S$ is finitely generated. $T=S\\cap M'$ is finitely generated as a submodule of a noetherian module ($M'$ is noetherian by the induction hypothesis.) $S/T=S/S\\cap M'\\simeq (S+M')/M'$ and the last one is a submodule of $M/M'$. But $M/M'$ is cyclic (generated by $\\bar v_{n+1}$), hence noetherian, so $S/T$ is finitely generated. That's all.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement from the original question.\n\nThe original question is about proving that any finitely generated module over a Noetherian ring is Noetherian using a specific proof approach. The user is confused about a particular step involving showing that (S + M')/M' is finitely generated.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. The problem statement should then be the specific part they need to prove, which in this case is understanding why (S + M')/M' is finitely generated and how that leads to the conclusion.\n\nWait, but the main problem in the question is part of the proof they're discussing. The user is trying to understand why (S + M')/M' is finitely generated. However, the overall problem they're working on is proving that any finitely generated R-module over a Noetherian ring is Noetherian. So I need to structure that main problem, not just the specific step they're stuck on.\n\nBut the example given by the user includes specific assumptions like \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7. Wait, looking back, the example might have been modified. The original problem states \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7.\" Hmm, maybe the example was a mistake. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem's assumption says n is divisible by 7, but that's incorrect because the original problem was for every integer n. So maybe the example is wrong. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in their example? Because 91 is 7*13, so perhaps the problem was actually when n is such that 5^n and 6^n satisfy certain congruences mod 7 and 13. But regardless, the example provided by the user has that, so perhaps the user is showing an example of how to structure, even if the example is incorrect. Therefore, I need to follow their format even if their example is not accurate. So, perhaps the key is to extract the assumptions from the problem as presented, even if in the original problem those assumptions are not stated.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" So maybe in the example, the original problem didn't have the assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the user added it as part of filtering unrelated info? That seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the example is incorrect. Hmm.\n\nBut perhaps in the given problem, the user wants to extract the necessary assumptions from the problem statement. Let me look at the Math Stack Exchange question again.\n\nTitle: Specific proof that any finitely generated $R$-module over a Noetherian ring is Noetherian.\n\nQuestion: The user is trying to follow a specific proof approach. The key elements mentioned:\n\n- $R$ is Noetherian.\n- $M$ is a finitely generated $R$-module.\n- The proof uses induction on the number of generators.\n- For the inductive step, $M$ is generated by $n+1$ elements, $M'$ is the submodule generated by the first $n$ generators, $S$ is an arbitrary submodule of $M$, and $T = S \\cap M'$.\n- They want to show that $S$ is finitely generated by noting that $T$ is finitely generated (since it's a submodule of $M'$, which by induction is Noetherian), and then considering $S/T \\cong (S + M')/M'$. The confusion is why $(S + M')/M'$ is finitely generated.\n\nSo the main problem here is proving that any finitely generated module over a Noetherian ring is Noetherian. The assumptions would include:\n\n- $R$ is a Noetherian ring.\n- $M$ is a finitely generated $R$-module.\n- For the inductive step, assume all $k$-generated modules (with $k \\leq n$) are Noetherian.\n- $M$ is $(n+1)$-generated.\n- $S$ is an arbitrary submodule of $M$.\n- $M'$ is a submodule of $M$ generated by $n$ elements.\n- $T = S \\cap M'$.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n$R$ is a Noetherian ring,\n$M$ is a finitely generated $R$-module,\n$M$ is generated by $n+1$ elements,\n$M'$ is a submodule of $M$ generated by the first $n$ generators,\n$S$ is an arbitrary submodule of $M$,\n$T = S \\cap M'$,\n$T$ is finitely generated as a submodule of $M'$,\n$M'$ is Noetherian by the induction hypothesis.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $S$ is finitely generated by showing that $(S + M')/M'$ is finitely generated.\n\nWait, but the problem statement in the example was a direct quote of the problem. So perhaps here, the problem is the main theorem they are trying to prove, but in the user's question, they are stuck on a specific step. However, according to the instructions, the task is to structure the problem as per the format. The user's example took the original problem and added an assumption (n divisible by 7), which might not have been in the original. But maybe that's a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the example is illustrative, and the actual problem needs assumptions extracted from the original question.\n\nIn the given question, the user is working through a proof, and their specific problem is understanding why $(S + M')/M'$ is finitely generated and how that leads to the conclusion. So the problem here is the step they are stuck on.\n\nBut the original problem they are trying to solve is proving that finitely generated modules over Noetherian rings are Noetherian. However, their specific question within that proof is about the step involving $(S + M')/M'$ being finitely generated.\n\nSo perhaps the assumptions are the conditions given in the proof up to that point, and the problem is to show that $(S + M')/M'$ is finitely generated.\n\nBut how to structure that?\n\nOriginal problem context:\n\nThe user is following a proof where they have:\n\n- $R$ Noetherian.\n- $M$ finitely generated, with $n+1$ generators.\n- $M'$ is generated by the first $n$ generators.\n- $S$ is a submodule of $M$.\n- $T = S \\cap M'$.\n- They know $T$ is finitely generated (since $M'$ is Noetherian by induction).\n- They need to show that $S/T$ is finitely generated, which would imply $S$ is finitely generated.\n\nBut $S/T \\cong (S + M')/M'$, and they want to know why $(S + M')/M'$ is finitely generated.\n\nSo the problem here is to show that $(S + M')/M'$ is finitely generated, given the setup.\n\nAssumptions for this specific step would include:\n\n- $R$ is a Noetherian ring.\n- $M$ is an $(n+1)$-generated $R$-module.\n- $M'$ is an $n$-generated submodule of $M$.\n- $S$ is a submodule of $M$.\n- $T = S \\cap M'$ is finitely generated (since $M'$ is Noetherian by induction hypothesis).\n- The quotient $(S + M')/M'$ is isomorphic to $S/(S \\cap M')$.\n\nBut the key point is why $(S + M')/M'$ is finitely generated. Since $M$ is generated by $n+1$ elements, and $M'$ is generated by $n$, then $M/M'$ is generated by the image of the $(n+1)$-th generator. So $(S + M')/M'$ is a submodule of $M/M'$, which is generated by one element. Since $R$ is Noetherian, and $M/M'$ is cyclic, hence Noetherian, so any submodule (including $(S + M')/M'$) is finitely generated.\n\nBut the user is stuck on this step, so the problem is to prove that $(S + M')/M'$ is finitely generated under the given assumptions.\n\nSo structuring this:\n\nAssumptions:\n$R$ is a Noetherian ring,\n$M$ is an $(n+1)$-generated $R$-module,\n$M'$ is a submodule of $M$ generated by the first $n$ generators of $M$,\n$S$ is a submodule of $M$,\n$T = S \\cap M'$ is finitely generated,\n$M'$ is Noetherian by the induction hypothesis.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $(S + M')/M'$ is finitely generated.\n\nBut the example given by the user had assumptions listed line by line, each applying to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\n$R$ is a Noetherian ring,\n$M$ is a finitely generated $R$-module,\n$M$ is generated by $n+1$ elements,\n$M'$ is a submodule of $M$ generated by $n$ elements,\n$S$ is a submodule of $M$,\n$T = S \\cap M'$,\n$T$ is finitely generated,\n$M'$ is Noetherian.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $(S + M')/M'$ is finitely generated.\n\nWait, but the problem here is part of the proof. So maybe the problem statement should be the overall theorem they're trying to prove, but the user's example formatted the problem as the specific divisibility question. However, in the example, the formatted problem is the original problem. But the user's question here is about a specific step in a proof. It's a bit ambiguous. The instruction says to \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" The original question's main problem is to prove the theorem, but the user is stuck on a step in the proof. So perhaps we need to structure the main problem as the theorem, with assumptions, and the problem statement being the theorem itself.\n\nAlternatively, the user's specific question within their post is about understanding why $(S + M')/M'$ is finitely generated. So maybe that's the problem to structure.\n\nBut according to the example, even if the original problem was about proving A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, the formatted problem listed an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which might not be in the original. So perhaps in the example, the user added an assumption that wasn't there. That seems confusing. Maybe the example is wrong. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instructions.\n\nIn the given case, the user is trying to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question. The original question is about proving that any finitely generated module over a Noetherian ring is Noetherian, using a specific proof approach. The user is confused about why $(S + M')/M'$ is finitely generated.\n\nSo perhaps the formatted problem is the step they're stuck on. Therefore:\n\nAssumptions:\n$R$ is a Noetherian ring,\n$M$ is a finitely generated $R$-module,\n$M$ is generated by $n+1$ elements,\n$M'$ is a submodule of $M$ generated by the first $n$ generators,\n$S$ is an arbitrary submodule of $M$,\n$T = S \\cap M'$,\n$T$ is finitely generated,\n$M'$ is Noetherian by induction hypothesis.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $(S + M')/M'$ is finitely generated.\n\nBut to fit the format, each assumption should address one property applied to one object. So breaking it down:\n\nAssumption:\n$R$ is a Noetherian ring,\n$M$ is a finitely generated $R$-module,\n$M$ is generated by $n+1$ elements,\n$M'$ is a submodule of $M$,\n$M'$ is generated by $n$ elements,\n$S$ is a submodule of $M$,\n$T = S \\cap M'$,\n$T$ is finitely generated,\n$M'$ is Noetherian.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $(S + M')/M'$ is finitely generated.\n\nBut maybe some of these assumptions can be inferred. For example, since $R$ is Noetherian and $M'$ is finitely generated (by n elements), by induction hypothesis $M'$ is Noetherian. So perhaps the assumption that $M'$ is Noetherian is redundant if we already have $R$ is Noetherian and $M'$ is finitely generated. But the user's proof is using induction on the number of generators, so they're assuming that all modules generated by ≤n elements are Noetherian. Therefore, $M'$ being generated by n elements is an assumption, and by induction hypothesis, it's Noetherian.\n\nSo in the assumptions, we need to include:\n\n- $R$ is Noetherian.\n- $M$ is an $(n+1)$-generated $R$-module.\n- $M'$ is a submodule of $M$ generated by $n$ elements (the first n generators of M).\n- By induction hypothesis, any module generated by ≤n elements is Noetherian, hence $M'$ is Noetherian.\n- $S$ is a submodule of $M$.\n- $T = S \\cap M'$, which is a submodule of $M'$, hence finitely generated (since $M'$ is Noetherian).\n\nTherefore, the problem is to show that $(S + M')/M'$ is finitely generated.\n\nBut how to structure this?\n\nAssumption:\n$R$ is a Noetherian ring,\n$M$ is an $(n+1)$-generated $R$-module,\n$M'$ is a submodule of $M$ generated by $n$ elements,\n$M'$ is Noetherian by induction hypothesis,\n$S$ is a submodule of $M$,\n$T = S \\cap M'$,\n$T$ is finitely generated.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $(S + M')/M'$ is finitely generated.\n\nAlternatively, since $M'$ being Noetherian follows from the induction hypothesis, maybe it's not an explicit assumption but a consequence. However, according to the example, the assumptions should list all conditions applied to each object. So if $M'$ is considered Noetherian because of the induction hypothesis, then it's an assumption in the context of the induction step.\n\nAlternatively, the induction hypothesis itself is an assumption. Maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n$R$ is a Noetherian ring,\n$M$ is a finitely generated $R$-module with $n+1$ generators,\n$M'$ is a submodule of $M$ generated by $n$ elements,\nBy induction hypothesis, any finitely generated $R$-module with $\\leq n$ generators is Noetherian,\n$S$ is a submodule of $M$,\n$T = S \\cap M'$,\n$T$ is finitely generated (as a submodule of the Noetherian module $M'$).\n\nProblem:\nProve that $(S + M')/M'$ is finitely generated.\n\nBut to keep each assumption to one line, applied to one object:\n\nAssumption:\n$R$ is a Noetherian ring,\n$M$ is a finitely generated $R$-module,\n$M$ is generated by $n+1$ elements,\n$M'$ is a submodule of $M$,\n$M'$ is generated by $n$ elements,\nBy induction hypothesis, any $R$-module generated by $\\leq n$ elements is Noetherian,\n$S$ is a submodule of $M$,\n$T = S \\cap M'$,\n$T$ is finitely generated.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $(S + M')/M'$ is finitely generated.\n\nThis seems comprehensive. Each line addresses one property of one object. Now, the problem is to show that specific quotient is finitely generated, which would then allow the conclusion that S is finitely generated (since T is f.g. and S/T is f.g.).\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have these assumptions and the problem statement about proving $(S + M')/M'$ is finitely generated.",
