    "AcceptedAnswer": "Suppose $G=L\\cup M\\cup N$ with $L$, $M$, and $N$ proper subgroups of $G$.  Recall that a group cannot be a union of two proper subgroups, so for each of $L$, $M$, and $N$, there exists an element that is not in the union of the other two. Claim 1. $L\\cap M=L\\cap N$. Let $u\\in L\\cap M$. If $u\\notin N$, then let $n\\in N\\setminus (L\\cup M)$. Then $un\\notin N$, since $n\\in N$ but $u\\notin N$; and $un\\notin L$, because $u\\in L$ but $n\\notin L$; and similarly $un\\notin M$. Thus, $un\\notin L\\cup M\\cup N$, a contradiction. Thus, if $u\\in L\\cap M$, then $u\\in N$. Thus, $L\\cap M\\subseteq L\\cap N$. The other inclusion follows symmetrically. Claim 2. $L\\cap M=L\\cap N=M\\cap N = L\\cap M\\cap N$. The argument from Claim 1, mutatis mutandis , establishes this. Claim 3. If $x,y\\notin L$, then $xy\\in L$. Note that $x$ and $y$ each lie in at most one of $M$ and $N$, since $M\\cap N\\subseteq L$. If $x\\in M\\setminus (L\\cup N)$ and $y\\in N\\setminus(L\\cup M)$, then $xy\\notin M\\cup N$, hence $xy\\in L$ and we are done. So assume that $x,y\\in M\\setminus (L\\cup N)$. Let $z\\in L\\setminus (M\\cup N)$; then $zx\\notin L\\cup M$, so $zx\\in N\\setminus (L\\cup M)$, and since $y\\in M\\setminus(L\\cup N)$ it follows that $z(xy)\\notin M\\cup N$, hence $z(xy)\\in L$. Since $z\\in L$, then $xy\\in L$, as claimed. Claim 4. If $x,y\\notin M$, then $xy\\in M$. If $x,y\\notin K$, then $xy\\in K$. The argument from Claim 3, mutatis mutandis , establishes this claim. Claim 5. $L\\cap M\\cap N\\triangleleft G$. Let $x\\in L\\cap M\\cap N$, and $g\\in G$. If $g$ is in at least two of $L$, $M$, and $N$, then it lies in all three so $gxg^{-1}\\in L\\cap M\\cap N$. If $g$ is in exactly one of $L$, $M$, and $N$, say $L$, then $gx\\notin M$, and $g^{-1}\\notin M$, hence by Claim 4 we have $gxg^{-1}\\in M$; likewise, $gx\\notin N$, $g^{-1}\\notin N$, so $gxg^{-1}\\in N$. Thus $gxg^{-1}\\in M\\cap N = L\\cap M\\cap N$, which proves that $L\\cap M\\cap N$ is normal. Corollary. $G/(L\\cap M\\cap N)$ is isomorphic to the Klein $4$-group. Proof. The nontrivial elements of $G/(L\\cap M\\cap N)$ correspond to cosets represented by elements that lie in exactly one of $L$, $M$, and $N$. If $g$ and $g'$ lie in $L$ but not in $M\\cup N$, then $g(L\\cap M\\cap N) = g'(L\\cap M\\cap N)$, since $g'^{-1}g\\in L\\cap M\\cap N$ by Claims 3 and 4. That is, we have exactly one coset corresponding to elements in $L$ but not in the triple intersection, one for $M$, and one for $K$. Thus, $G/(L\\cap M\\cap N)$ has exactly four elements; by Claims 3 and 4, each element is of exponent $2$, so $G/(L\\cap M\\cap N)$ is the Klein $4$-group. $\\Box$ Also worth noting: Proposition. A group $G$ is a union of three proper subgroups if and only if $G$ has a quotient isomorphic to the Klein $4$-group. Proof. The necessity was proven above. Conversely, the Klein $4$-group $C_2\\times C_2$ is the union of its three nontrivial proper subgroups, so by the isomorphism theorems, if $G/N\\cong C_2\\times C_2$, then the pullbacks of these three subgroups are proper and their union is all of $G$.  $\\Box$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me start by understanding the original question.\n\nThe title is: \"How to show that if $G$ is union of three proper subgroups, then there is an epimorphism from $G$ to the Klein 4-group?\"\n\nThe question body adds more details: The user is working through Grove's \"Algebra\" and is stuck on proving that if a group G is the union of three proper subgroups, then there exists an epimorphism (a surjective homomorphism) from G to the Klein 4-group. They mention that the subgroups might correspond to the non-identity elements of the Klein group.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement according to the given format. The example provided shows that each assumption is a single condition applied to one object. So I need to list all the conditions here.\n\nLooking at the problem: The main conditions are:\n\n1. G is a group.\n2. G is the union of three proper subgroups.\n3. The three subgroups are proper (but this might be redundant since the union is already stated as three proper subgroups).\n4. The target is the Klein 4-group, which is a specific group of order 4, isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2.\n\nWait, the problem states \"if G is the union of three proper subgroups,\" so the assumptions are:\n\n- G is a group.\n- G is the union of three proper subgroups.\n\nBut the original problem doesn't mention any additional conditions on G beyond being a group that's the union of three proper subgroups. The conclusion is about the existence of an epimorphism to the Klein 4-group. The Klein 4-group itself has specific properties, but those are part of the target group, not assumptions on G.\n\nWait, maybe the problem's assumptions are just:\n\n- G is a group.\n- G can be expressed as the union of three proper subgroups.\n\nSo in the Assumption section, each line should list one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a group,\nG is the union of three proper subgroups.\n\nThen the problem is to show there's an epimorphism from G to the Klein 4-group.\n\nBut wait, the original problem statement says \"if G is the union of three proper subgroups, then there is an epimorphism...\". So the condition is that G is a union of three proper subgroups. The problem is to prove the existence of the epimorphism.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a group,\nG is the union of three proper subgroups.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists an epimorphism from G to the Klein 4-group.\n\nBut let me check the example given. In the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, but the user's formatted problem included an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect because the original problem was for every integer n, so maybe the user made a mistake. But in the example provided, the user added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the original problem didn't have that. So perhaps the example was incorrect. However, in the current problem, the user wants me to structure the problem as per the format, which in the example included filtering unrelated information and listing assumptions.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question doesn't have any extra assumptions beyond G being a group that's the union of three proper subgroups. So the assumptions are:\n\n- G is a group.\n- G is the union of three proper subgroups.\n\nThe problem is to show there's an epimorphism from G to the Klein 4-group.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem assumes that the three subgroups are proper. However, the term \"proper\" is part of the condition when stating that G is the union of three proper subgroups. So each of those subgroups is a proper subgroup of G.\n\nTherefore, each assumption line should be:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a group,\nG is the union of three proper subgroups.\n\nEach of these is a separate condition. The first line states that G is a group, which is the primary structure. The second line states the specific condition about being a union of three proper subgroups. Proper here means each subgroup is not equal to G itself.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nG is a group,\nG is the union of three proper subgroups.\nProblem: \nProve that there exists an epimorphism from $G$ to the Klein 4-group.\n###\n\nI think that's correct. The user's example included assumptions that weren't in the original problem (like n divisible by 7), but perhaps that was a mistake. Here, we need to stick strictly to the given problem. The original problem states \"if G is the union of three proper subgroups\", so that's the key assumption. The group structure is also an assumption, as we're talking about subgroups and epimorphisms in group theory.\n\nAnother check: The problem is to show an epimorphism exists. The Klein 4-group is the codomain. The assumptions are on G. So yes, the two assumptions are correct.",
