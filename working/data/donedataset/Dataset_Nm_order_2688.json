    "Content": "This is an exercise from Spivak's Calculus: Prove that for any polynomial function $f$, and any number $a$, there is a polynomial function $g$, and a number $b$, such that $f(x)=(x-a)g(x)+b$ for all $x$. (The idea is simply to divide $(x-a)$ into $f(x)$ by long division, until a constant remainder is left. [. . .] A formal proof is possible by induction on the degree of $f$. I did an adaptation of this question and decided to figure out precisely what $g(x)$ and $b$ are. Here is what I ended up with: First, presume $f$ takes the form:\n$$f_n(x)=\\sum_{u=0}^{n}c_ux^u$$ Then:\n$$f_n(x)=(x-a)\\sum_{q=1}^{n}\\sum_{z=q}^{n}a^{z-q}c_zx^{q-1}+\\sum_{z=0}^{n}a^zc_z$$ I've had a really hard time figuring out a clean and nice way to show this is true. But, I'm pretty sure it's accurate. I can't quite show the extensive work in deriving this because it's a lot of synthetic division and long division, then noticing patterns among the remainders and the quotients. My manipulations of double sums are not that great, so I'd appreciate if anyone could either 1) show that I'm wrong (which is very possible) or 2) show how this is right, in a preferably elegant way. One method is thus: Assuming that $b=\\sum_{z=0}^{n}a^zc_z$, then $g(x)$ could be derived by 'basic' algebra:\n$$\\sum_{u=0}^{n}c_ux^u=(x-a)g(x)+\\sum_{z=0}^{n}a^zc_z \\Rightarrow g(x)=\\frac{\\sum_{u=0}^{n}c_ux^u-a^{u}c_u}{(x-a)}$$\n$$g(x)=\\frac{\\sum_{u=0}^{n}c_u(x^u-a^u)}{(x-a)}$$\n$$\\frac{x^u-a^u}{(x-a)}=\\sum_{k=1}^{u}a^{u-k}x^{k-1}$$\n$$\\therefore g(x)=\\sum_{u=0}^{n}\\sum_{k=1}^{u}a^{u-k}c_ux^{k-1}$$ This seems to contradict what I just wrote, but it brings up another question:\nIs $$\\sum_{u=0}^{n}\\sum_{k=1}^{u}a^{u-k}c_ux^{k-1}=\\sum_{q=1}^{n}\\sum_{z=q}^{n}a^{z-q}c_zx^{q-1}\\text{?}$$ I think it is, and I can show that thus: First, change the right hand side: $\\sum_{k=1}^{n}\\sum_{u=k}^{n}a^{u-k}c_ux^{k-1}$. Then, make the substitution $e_{u,k}=a^{u-k}c_ux^{k-1}$ So, you have: $$\\sum_{u=0}^{n}\\sum_{k=1}^{u}e_{u,k}=\\sum_{k=1}^{0}e_{0,k}+\\sum_{k=1}^{1}e_{1,k}+\\sum_{k=1}^{2}e_{2,k}+\\dots+\\sum_{k=1}^{n-2}e_{(n-2),k}+\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}e_{(n-1),k}+\\sum_{k=1}^{n}e_{n,k}$$\n$$\\sum_{u=0}^{n}\\sum_{k=1}^{u}e_{u,k}=\\sum_{k=1}^{n}e_{n,k}+\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}e_{(n-1),k}+\\sum_{k=1}^{n-2}e_{(n-2),k}+\\dots+\\sum_{k=1}^{2}e_{2,k}+\\sum_{k=1}^{1}e_{1,k}+\\sum_{k=1}^{0}e_{0,k}$$ Each sum can be modified thusly: $$\\sum_{k=1}^{n-j}e_{(n-j),k}=\\sum_{k=(1+j)}^{n}e_{(n-j),(k-j)}$$ So, by inspection, the two sums are equivalent. I guess what my question now amounts to is thus: Are there any methods I'm simply not using that I could be using? And am I incorrect in any of my methods and statements above? Feel free to use a completely different approach to solve this, I'd like to see other approaches. P.S. If you would like, feel free to provide a proof of the original problem by induction.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here's a quick derivation along the lines suggested by @Pierre-YvesGaillard.\nIt may be against the spirit of what Spivak intended since it avoids induction, but it is a different and simple way to go. Suppose $f(x)$ is an $n$th degree polynomial. \nThen \n$$\\begin{eqnarray*}\nf(x) &=& \\sum_{k=0}^n \\frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!} (x-a)^k \\\\\n&=& \\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!} (x-a)^k + f(a) \\\\\n&=& (x-a) \\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!} (x-a)^{k-1} + f(a) \\\\\n&=& (x-a) \\underbrace{\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\frac{f^{(k+1)}(a)}{(k+1)!} (x-a)^{k}}_{g(x)} + \\underbrace{f(a)}_b.\n\\end{eqnarray*}$$\nAs claimed, $g(x)$ is a polynomial (of degree $n-1$) and $b$ is a constant.\nWe have used the fact that the Taylor expansion of a polynomial of degree $n$ terminates at the $n$th term, since $D^m x^n = 0$ for $m>n$. \nIt is a good exercise to show that this $g$ and $b$ agree with your formula for $f$. I recommend using the Iverson bracket when manipulating double sums (among other things).\nHere's a sample calculation:\n$$\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\sum_{a=0}^n \\sum_{b=0}^a \n&=& \\sum_{a,b} [0\\le a\\le n] [0\\le b \\le a] \\\\\n&=& \\sum_{a,b} [0\\le b\\le a\\le n] \\\\\n&=& \\sum_{a,b} [0 \\le b \\le n] [b \\le a \\le n] \\\\\n&=& \\sum_{b=0}^n \\sum_{a=b}^n\n\\end{eqnarray*}$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is working on an exercise from Spivak's Calculus, which asks to prove that for any polynomial function f and any number a, there exists a polynomial g and a number b such that f(x) = (x - a)g(x) + b for all x. The user attempted to derive explicit expressions for g(x) and b, and now is checking if their approach is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the original problem and the user's approach. The user started with a polynomial f_n(x) = sum_{u=0}^n c_u x^u and claims that f_n(x) can be written as (x - a) times a double sum plus another sum. They also derived another expression for g(x) using algebraic manipulation, ending up with a different double sum. The user is confused whether these two expressions for g(x) are equivalent and is looking for validation or correction of their methods.\n\nLooking at the assumptions, the problem states \"for any polynomial function f, and any number a\". So, the key assumptions here are that f is a polynomial and a is any number. The user's own approach assumes f is a polynomial of degree n with coefficients c_u, which is standard. The problem doesn't specify any restrictions on the coefficients or the value of a, so the assumptions should reflect that.\n\nThe problem as posed by the user seems to be about verifying whether their derived expressions for g(x) and b are correct. Specifically, they are comparing two different double sum expressions for g(x) and asking if they are equal. Additionally, they want to know if their methods are valid or if there's a better approach, possibly including an inductive proof.\n\nBut following the format provided, the user wants the problem structured into Assumptions and Problem. The example given for the divisibility problem shows that assumptions list each condition applied to one object. So in this case, the assumptions would be that f is a polynomial function, a is any number, etc.\n\nWait, the original problem from Spivak is to prove the existence of g and b such that f(x) = (x - a)g(x) + b. The user's specific problem is about verifying their expressions for g(x) and b, which they derived through summations. However, the user's question is whether their derived expressions are correct and if their method is valid. But the way the example was formatted, the Assumption section lists the conditions given in the problem. So in the original problem's case, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7. For the current problem, the assumptions would be that f is any polynomial function, a is any number, etc.\n\nBut the user's specific problem is about their derived expressions. However, in the example, the user rephrased the original problem into assumptions and the problem statement. So perhaps here, the problem statement is the user's question: verifying if the two expressions for g(x) are equivalent, given their derivations.\n\nBut the user's actual question is a bit more complex. Let me read again their final questions:\n\n1) They want to know if they are wrong or if someone can show how their result is right elegantly.\n\n2) They ask if the two double sums they derived for g(x) are equal.\n\n3) They also ask if there are other methods they aren't using and if their methods are incorrect.\n\nBut according to the format provided, the task is to filter the Math Stack Exchange question into Assumptions and Problem. The example took the original problem and structured it, even though the user had some initial attempt. In the example, the original problem was about proving divisibility, and the formatted version listed the assumptions (n is integer, divisible by 7) and the problem (prove A(n) is divisible by 91).\n\nIn the current case, the original problem is Spivak's problem, but the user is asking about their specific approach. However, the user's question is a bit long with multiple parts. To structure it properly, perhaps the main problem the user is posing is whether their derived expressions for g(x) are correct and equivalent. Alternatively, if we follow the example, we need to present the problem as per the original exercise but with the user's specific focus.\n\nWait, the example seems to have taken the original problem (prove A(n) is divisible by 91) and listed the assumptions (n is integer, n divisible by 7). Wait, but in the original problem, the user wrote the formatted version with assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. However, the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7. Wait, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", so in the example, the user incorrectly added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, maybe that was a mistake. Wait, no, looking back:\n\nOriginal problem:\n\n\"Prove that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\"\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems incorrect. Maybe that example was wrong? Or perhaps the example was for a modified problem? Maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Because the original problem doesn't require n to be divisible by 7, but the formatted version added that. So perhaps the example is incorrect. Hmm. Therefore, maybe the example is not a good guide. But regardless, the task is to follow that format.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's original question is from Spivak, but the user has done some work and has specific questions about their work. However, following the format, we need to present the problem as per the user's actual question, which is whether their expressions for g(x) and b are correct, and whether their method is valid. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to show the equivalence of the two double sums or to validate the user's derivation.\n\nBut the example seems to take the original problem and structure it, perhaps ignoring the user's attempt. Wait, in the example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n...\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that \"n is divisible by 7\". Which contradicts the original problem. So maybe in that example, the user intended to modify the problem. Therefore, maybe in the current case, the task is to present the problem as posed by the user in their question, filtering out the extraneous information.\n\nThe user's question is:\n\nThey derived two expressions for g(x):\n\n1. From their initial approach: $$g(x) = \\sum_{q=1}^{n}\\sum_{z=q}^{n}a^{z - q}c_z x^{q - 1}$$\n\n2. From another algebraic manipulation: $$g(x) = \\sum_{u=0}^{n}\\sum_{k=1}^{u}a^{u - k}c_u x^{k - 1}$$\n\nThen, they ask if these two expressions are equal. So the problem, in this case, is to determine if these two double sums are equivalent.\n\nAdditionally, they want to know if their methods are correct or if there's a better approach.\n\nBut according to the format, we need to list the assumptions and then state the problem. The assumptions here would be:\n\n- f is a polynomial function of degree n: $$f_n(x) = \\sum_{u=0}^{n} c_u x^u$$\n\n- a is any number.\n\n- The remainder b is given by: $$b = \\sum_{z=0}^{n} a^z c_z$$\n\n- The problem is to verify whether the two expressions for g(x) are equivalent.\n\nSo, the assumptions are about the polynomial, the number a, the form of b, and the expressions for g(x). Then the problem is to show if the two double sums for g(x) are equal.\n\nAlternatively, the main problem from the user's perspective is whether their expressions for g(x) are correct and equivalent. So, structuring that:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- $f$ is a polynomial function of degree $n$, expressed as $f_n(x) = \\sum_{u=0}^n c_u x^u$.\n\n- $a$ is a real number.\n\n- The remainder term $b$ is given by $b = \\sum_{z=0}^n a^z c_z$.\n\n- The polynomial $g(x)$ is derived such that $f_n(x) = (x - a)g(x) + b$.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve or disprove that the expressions  \n$$g(x) = \\sum_{q=1}^{n}\\sum_{z=q}^{n}a^{z - q}c_z x^{q - 1}$$  \nand  \n$$g(x) = \\sum_{u=0}^{n}\\sum_{k=1}^{u}a^{u - k}c_u x^{k - 1}$$  \nare equivalent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is more about showing the equivalence of these two sums. But the user also mentions other approaches, so perhaps the problem is to validate their derivation or provide an alternative proof.\n\nBut according to the example, the problem should be the main question stripped of the user's attempts and structured with assumptions. The original problem from Spivak is to show the division with remainder, but the user is now focusing on their specific derived expressions. However, since the example includes assumptions that might have been incorrect, perhaps the key is to extract the core mathematical problem from the user's question, which is the equivalence of the two double sums for g(x).\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would include that f is a polynomial, a is a number, and the expressions for g(x) as given. The problem is to show if the two expressions for g(x) are equal.\n\nBut another angle is that the user is working under the assumption of the original problem (any polynomial f, any number a) and their derived expressions. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- $f$ is a polynomial function.\n\n- $a$ is a real number.\n\n- The division $f(x) = (x - a)g(x) + b$ holds with $b = f(a)$.\n\nThen, the problem is to express $g(x)$ in the two given double sum forms and show their equivalence.\n\nBut in the user's case, they derived two expressions for g(x) and want to know if they are the same. Therefore, the problem is to prove the equality of the two double sums given the context of polynomial division.\n\nSo, structuring this:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- $f_n(x) = \\sum_{u=0}^n c_u x^u$ is a polynomial of degree $n$.\n\n- $a$ is a real number.\n\n- The remainder $b$ is given by $b = \\sum_{z=0}^n a^z c_z$.\n\n- $g(x)$ is a polynomial such that $f_n(x) = (x - a)g(x) + b$.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that  \n$$\\sum_{q=1}^{n}\\sum_{z=q}^{n}a^{z - q}c_z x^{q - 1} = \\sum_{u=0}^{n}\\sum_{k=1}^{u}a^{u - k}c_u x^{k - 1}.$$\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is more general, but given the user's specific question, this seems to be the core.\n\nAlternatively, considering the original problem from Spivak, which is to prove the existence of g and b, and the user's attempt to find explicit forms, perhaps the problem is to derive the expressions for g(x) and b, but the user has already done that and is now verifying their equivalence.\n\nBut given the user's final question: \"Is [sum1] = [sum2]?\", the main problem is to check the equality of the two double sums.\n\nThus, the assumptions would be the definitions of the sums, and the problem is to prove their equality.\n\nBut perhaps the key assumptions are the definitions of the sums with their respective indices. But in the example, the assumptions were about the objects in the problem (n is integer, n divisible by 7). So here, the assumptions would relate to the polynomial, the number a, and the coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, since the user is working within the context of polynomial division, the key assumptions are:\n\n- $f$ is a polynomial with coefficients $c_u$.\n\n- $a$ is a constant.\n\n- The remainder $b$ is $f(a)$.\n\n- $g(x)$ is the quotient polynomial.\n\nBut the problem is specifically about the two expressions for g(x). Therefore, the assumptions should include the expressions for g(x) as given.\n\nBut following the example's structure, where assumptions were conditions on the problem's variables, here the assumptions would be:\n\n- $f(x)$ is a polynomial function.\n\n- $a$ is a real number.\n\n- $g(x)$ is a polynomial function.\n\n- $b$ is a real number.\n\n- The equation $f(x) = (x - a)g(x) + b$ holds for all $x$.\n\nThen the problem would be to express $g(x)$ in terms of the coefficients of $f$ and $a$, but the user's specific problem is about the equivalence of two expressions. However, the example included assumptions that were perhaps specific to the answerer's approach, but in the given example, the original problem had no assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the formatted version added it. That might be an error.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example was meant to reformulate the problem with necessary assumptions. If the original problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but 91=13*7, so perhaps the assumptions are that n is an integer divisible by both 7 and 13. But in the example, they only listed n divisible by 7. That might be a mistake. Regardless, perhaps the example is not perfectly illustrative.\n\nIn any case, returning to the current problem. The user's core question is: Are these two double sums equal?\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be the definitions of the sums in terms of the polynomial coefficients and the number a. The problem is to prove their equality.\n\nThus:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- For each integer $u$ such that $0 \\leq u \\leq n$, $c_u$ is a real coefficient.\n\n- $a$ is a real number.\n\n- The indices $q, z, u, k$ range over integers as specified in the sums.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that  \n$$\\sum_{q=1}^{n}\\sum_{z=q}^{n}a^{z - q}c_z x^{q - 1} = \\sum_{u=0}^{n}\\sum_{k=1}^{u}a^{u - k}c_u x^{k - 1}.$$\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions should include that f is a polynomial, a is a number, etc., but the key here is to present the problem as per the user's main question, which is the equality of the two double sums.\n\nHowever, according to the example, the assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. So, in this case:\n\nAssumption:\n\n$f$ is a polynomial function of degree $n$,\n\n$a$ is a real number,\n\n$g(x)$ is a polynomial function,\n\n$b$ is a real number,\n\n$f(x) = (x - a)g(x) + b$ holds for all $x$,\n\n$b = \\sum_{z=0}^{n} a^z c_z$,\n\nthe first expression for $g(x)$ is $\\sum_{q=1}^{n}\\sum_{z=q}^{n}a^{z - q}c_z x^{q - 1}$,\n\nthe second expression for $g(x)$ is $\\sum_{u=0}^{n}\\sum_{k=1}^{u}a^{u - k}c_u x^{k - 1}$.\n\nProblem:\n\nShow that the two expressions for $g(x)$ are equivalent.\n\nBut maybe each assumption should be one line per property. So:\n\nAssumption:\n\n$f(x) = \\sum_{u=0}^{n} c_u x^u$ is a polynomial,\n\n$a$ is a real number,\n\n$g(x)$ is a polynomial function,\n\n$b$ is a real number,\n\n$f(x) = (x - a)g(x) + b$ for all $x$,\n\n$b = \\sum_{z=0}^{n} a^z c_z$,\n\n$g(x) = \\sum_{q=1}^{n}\\sum_{z=q}^{n}a^{z - q}c_z x^{q - 1}$,\n\n$g(x) = \\sum_{u=0}^{n}\\sum_{k=1}^{u}a^{u - k}c_u x^{k - 1}$.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that the two expressions for $g(x)$ are equal.\n\nBut this seems redundant, as the problem is to prove their equality given the other assumptions. However, the key is that the user wants to know if these two expressions are the same. So, the problem is to show the equality of the two double sums under the given conditions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is more generally to derive the expression for g(x) given f(x) divided by (x - a), but the user is focusing on their specific derived forms.\n\nBut following the example, which rephrased the original problem with assumptions and problem, perhaps the current problem should be structured as:\n\nAssumption:\n\n$f$ is a polynomial function,\n\n$a$ is a real number.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that there exists a polynomial function $g$ and a number $b$ such that $f(x) = (x - a)g(x) + b$ for all $x$.\n\nBut the user's specific question is about their expressions, which is a follow-up. However, the example didn't include the user's attempt but restructured the original problem. So perhaps the correct approach is to present the original problem as per Spivak, filtering out the user's attempts, and structuring it with assumptions and problem.\n\nThe original problem from Spivak is: Prove that for any polynomial function f, and any number a, there is a polynomial function g, and a number b, such that f(x)=(x-a)g(x)+b for all x.\n\nTherefore, structured as:\n\nAssumption:\n\n$f$ is a polynomial function,\n\n$a$ is a real number.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that there exists a polynomial function $g$ and a number $b$ such that $f(x) = (x - a)g(x) + b$ for all $x$.\n\nBut the user's actual question is about their specific expressions. However, according to the initial instruction, the task is to read the Math Stack Exchange question, filter the unrelated information, and structure it into Assumption and Problem sections. The example given by the user included the original problem and rephrased it, even though in the example, they added an extra assumption. But perhaps the correct approach here is to present the original problem from Spivak as the problem, with the relevant assumptions.\n\nThe user's entire question includes their attempt and specific questions about their double sums, but the task is to filter out the unrelated info. So, the core problem is Spivak's original question. The user's work and questions about the double sums are their attempt, which should be filtered out. Hence, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\n$f$ is a polynomial function,\n\n$a$ is a real number.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that there exists a polynomial function $g$ and a number $b$ such that $f(x) = (x - a)g(x) + b$ for all $x$.\n\nBut the user's original post title is \"What is $f(x)$ divided by $(x - a)$?\" So perhaps the problem is not just existence but also expressing $g(x)$ and $b$ explicitly. The user's attempt was to find explicit forms, but the original problem from Spivak just asks to prove existence. However, the user is asking about their specific expressions. But following the example, which extracted the original problem, perhaps here we should do the same.\n\nBut the example might have been incorrect. Given that, perhaps the correct approach is to present the problem as the user's core question, which is about the equivalence of the two double sums. But since the instruction says to read the Math Stack Exchange question and structure it into assumptions and problem, filtering unrelated info. The user's post starts with the original problem, then details their attempt. The task is to extract the problem they are asking help with, which is verifying their expressions for g(x) and b.\n\nBut given the example, which rephrased the original problem, perhaps here the same applies. Thus, the formatted problem would be Spivak's original problem, with assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\n\n$f$ is a polynomial function,\n\n$a$ is a real number.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that there exists a polynomial function $g$ and a number $b$ such that $f(x) = (x - a)g(x) + b$ for all $x$.\n\nBut the user's actual question is more about their specific derivation. However, the instruction might require us to present the original problem, not the user's specific follow-up questions. Since the example extracted the original problem (even though it added an incorrect assumption), perhaps here we should present the original problem from Spivak.\n\nBut in the example, the user had a problem where the original statement was \"for every integer n\", but the formatted version added an assumption \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect, but perhaps it's illustrative of how to list assumptions even if they are not explicitly stated. Maybe in that example, the correct approach requires n to be divisible by both 7 and 13 (since 91=7*13), but the user might have considered that n being an integer is the only assumption, but they added divisibility by 7, which is incorrect.\n\nGiven that confusion, perhaps in the current case, it's safer to stick to the original problem as stated by the user, which is Spivak's problem, and present it with the correct assumptions.\n\nThus, the answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$f$ is a polynomial function,\n$a$ is a real number.\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a polynomial function $g$ and a number $b$ such that $f(x) = (x - a)g(x) + b$ for all $x$.",
