    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants to prove that π³/32 equals 1 minus an infinite sum involving the Riemann zeta function. The given equation is:\n\nπ³/32 = 1 - Σ [2k(2k+1)ζ(2k+2)/4^{2k+2}] from k=1 to ∞.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some properties of the Riemann zeta function. The zeta function ζ(s) is defined as the sum from n=1 to ∞ of 1/n^s. Here, the sum involves ζ(2k+2), which would be ζ evaluated at even integers starting from 4 (since k starts at 1, 2k+2 would be 4,6,8,...). I remember that there are known expressions for ζ(2n) involving Bernoulli numbers and powers of π, but here the exponent is 2k+2, which is even, so maybe those formulas can be related.\n\nNext, looking at the structure of the sum: each term has 2k(2k+1) multiplied by ζ(2k+2) and divided by 4^{2k+2}. Let's simplify the denominator: 4^{2k+2} is (4^2)^k * 4^2 = 16^k * 16. Wait, no, 4^{2k+2} is 4^{2k} * 4^2 = (16)^k * 16. So, 4^{2k+2} = 16^{k} * 16. Therefore, the denominator is 16^{k+1}. So each term can be written as [2k(2k+1)/16^{k+1}] * ζ(2k+2).\n\nHmm. Maybe we can express ζ(2k+2) as a sum and interchange the order of summation. Let's write ζ(2k+2) = Σ_{n=1}^∞ 1/n^{2k+2}. Then, the original sum becomes Σ_{k=1}^∞ [2k(2k+1)/16^{k+1}] * Σ_{n=1}^∞ 1/n^{2k+2}. If we can interchange the sums, we might get Σ_{n=1}^∞ Σ_{k=1}^∞ [2k(2k+1)/16^{k+1} * 1/n^{2k+2}].\n\nLet me check if interchanging sums is valid here. Since all terms are positive, by Tonelli's theorem, it should be permissible. Then, we can write the inner sum as Σ_{k=1}^∞ 2k(2k+1)/(16^{k+1} n^{2k+2}).\n\nSimplifying this, note that 16^{k+1} = 16 * 16^k, and n^{2k+2} = n^2 * (n^2)^k. So, each term becomes [2k(2k+1)] / [16 * n^2 * (16 n^2)^k]. Let's factor out 1/(16 n^2), giving [1/(16 n^2)] * Σ_{k=1}^∞ [2k(2k+1)] / (16 n^2)^k.\n\nNow, the inner sum is Σ_{k=1}^∞ 2k(2k+1) x^k, where x = 1/(16 n^2). I need to find a closed-form for such a sum. Let's consider generating functions for sequences involving k(2k+1) x^k. Maybe differentiate a known series.\n\nRecall that Σ_{k=0}^∞ x^k = 1/(1 - x) for |x| < 1. Then, differentiating both sides, Σ_{k=1}^∞ k x^{k-1} = 1/(1 - x)^2, so Σ_{k=1}^∞ k x^k = x/(1 - x)^2.\n\nSimilarly, differentiating again, Σ_{k=1}^∞ k(k-1) x^{k-2} = 2/(1 - x)^3, so Σ_{k=1}^∞ k(k-1) x^k = 2x^2/(1 - x)^3.\n\nBut here we have 2k(2k + 1) x^k. Let me see. Let's denote m = 2k. Then, maybe express 2k(2k + 1) as 2k(2k + 1) = 4k^2 + 2k. So, the sum becomes Σ_{k=1}^∞ (4k^2 + 2k) x^k = 4 Σ k^2 x^k + 2 Σ k x^k.\n\nWe know Σ k x^k = x/(1 - x)^2, and Σ k^2 x^k = x(1 + x)/(1 - x)^3. Therefore, substituting:\n\n4 * [x(1 + x)/(1 - x)^3] + 2 * [x/(1 - x)^2] = [4x(1 + x) + 2x(1 - x)] / (1 - x)^3.\n\nSimplify numerator: 4x + 4x^2 + 2x - 2x^2 = (6x + 2x^2). So, the sum becomes (6x + 2x^2)/(1 - x)^3.\n\nTherefore, Σ_{k=1}^∞ 2k(2k + 1) x^k = (6x + 2x^2)/(1 - x)^3.\n\nWait, let me verify that. Wait, original expression was 4 Σ k^2 x^k + 2 Σ k x^k. So:\n\n4 * [x(1 + x)/(1 - x)^3] + 2 * [x/(1 - x)^2] = 4x(1 + x)/(1 - x)^3 + 2x/(1 - x)^2.\n\nTo combine these terms, factor out 2x/(1 - x)^3:\n\n2x/(1 - x)^3 [2(1 + x) + (1 - x)].\n\nWait, let's get a common denominator. The first term is 4x(1 + x)/(1 - x)^3 and the second is 2x/(1 - x)^2. Let's write the second term as 2x(1 - x)/(1 - x)^3. Then, adding them together:\n\n[4x(1 + x) + 2x(1 - x)] / (1 - x)^3 = [4x + 4x^2 + 2x - 2x^2] / (1 - x)^3 = [6x + 2x^2]/(1 - x)^3. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the inner sum Σ_{k=1}^∞ 2k(2k+1) x^k = (6x + 2x^2)/(1 - x)^3.\n\nNow, substituting back x = 1/(16 n^2), we have:\n\n(6*(1/(16 n^2)) + 2*(1/(16 n^2)^2) / (1 - 1/(16 n^2))^3.\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n6/(16 n^2) + 2/(256 n^4) = (6/16 n²) + (2/256 n⁴) = (3/8 n²) + (1/128 n⁴).\n\nDenominator: (1 - 1/(16 n²))³ = [(16 n² - 1)/16 n²)]³ = (16 n² - 1)^3 / (16 n²)^3.\n\nPutting numerator over denominator:\n\n[ (3/8 n²) + (1/128 n⁴) ] / [ (16 n² - 1)^3 / (16 n²)^3 ) ] = [ (3/8 n² + 1/128 n⁴) * (16 n²)^3 ) ] / (16 n² - 1)^3.\n\nLet me compute (16 n²)^3 = 4096 n^6. Then:\n\n3/8 n² * 4096 n^6 = 3/8 * 4096 n^8 = 3 * 512 n^8 = 1536 n^8.\n\n1/128 n⁴ * 4096 n^6 = 1/128 * 4096 n^10 = 32 n^10.\n\nSo numerator becomes (1536 n^8 + 32 n^10) = 32 n^8 (48 + n²).\n\nDenominator: (16 n² - 1)^3.\n\nTherefore, the inner sum becomes 32 n^8 (48 + n²) / (16 n² - 1)^3.\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe I made a mistake in simplifying. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the numerator after substitution is [3/(8 n²) + 1/(128 n^4)] multiplied by (16 n²)^3.\n\nCompute each term separately:\n\nFirst term: 3/(8 n²) * (16 n²)^3 = 3/(8 n²) * 4096 n^6 = 3 * 4096 / 8 * n^{6 - 2} = 3 * 512 * n^4 = 1536 n^4.\n\nSecond term: 1/(128 n^4) * (16 n²)^3 = 1/(128 n^4) * 4096 n^6 = 4096 / 128 * n^{6 -4} = 32 n².\n\nTherefore, numerator is 1536 n^4 + 32 n² = 32 n² (48 n² + 1).\n\nDenominator: (16 n² - 1)^3.\n\nSo the inner sum is 32 n² (48 n² + 1) / (16 n² - 1)^3.\n\nTherefore, the entire original sum Σ_{k=1}^∞ [2k(2k+1)ζ(2k+2)/4^{2k+2}] becomes Σ_{n=1}^∞ [32 n² (48 n² + 1)] / [16 n² (16 n² -1)^3 ].\n\nWait, because remember earlier we had factored out 1/(16 n²) from the inner sum. Wait, no, let's recap. The original sum after interchange became Σ_{n=1}^∞ [1/(16 n²)] * [inner sum], which after substitution became Σ_{n=1}^∞ [1/(16 n²)] * [32 n² (48 n² +1)/ (16 n² -1)^3)].\n\nAh, right. So the 1/(16 n²) multiplied by 32 n² gives 32 n² / (16 n²) = 2. So, the term simplifies to 2*(48 n² +1)/(16 n² -1)^3.\n\nTherefore, the entire sum is Σ_{n=1}^∞ [2(48 n² +1)] / (16 n² -1)^3.\n\nSo now the problem reduces to showing that 1 - Σ_{n=1}^∞ [2(48 n² +1)] / (16 n² -1)^3 = π³/32.\n\nHmm. This seems a bit messy, but maybe there's a telescoping series or partial fraction decomposition here. Alternatively, perhaps we can relate this to known integrals or series involving π.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider the sum Σ_{n=1}^∞ [2(48 n² +1)]/(16 n² -1)^3.\n\nLet me factor denominator: 16n² -1 = (4n -1)(4n +1). But cubed. So denominator is (4n -1)^3 (4n +1)^3? Wait, no. Wait, (16n² -1) = (4n -1)(4n +1). So (16n² -1)^3 = (4n -1)^3 (4n +1)^3.\n\nBut maybe partial fractions can help here. Let's try to express [48n² +1]/(16n² -1)^3 as partial fractions.\n\nLet me denote x = 4n. Then 16n² = x². So 16n² -1 = x² -1 = (x -1)(x +1). So [48n² +1]/(x² -1)^3 = [3x² +1]/(x² -1)^3, since 48n² = 3*(16n²) = 3x². So numerator is 3x² +1, denominator is (x² -1)^3.\n\nSo we need to decompose [3x² +1]/(x² -1)^3.\n\nThis can be written as [3x² +1]/[(x -1)^3(x +1)^3]. Partial fractions might be complicated here, but let's attempt.\n\nLet me set [3x² +1]/[(x -1)^3(x +1)^3] = A/(x -1) + B/(x -1)^2 + C/(x -1)^3 + D/(x +1) + E/(x +1)^2 + F/(x +1)^3.\n\nMultiply both sides by (x -1)^3(x +1)^3:\n\n3x² +1 = A(x -1)^2(x +1)^3 + B(x -1)(x +1)^3 + C(x +1)^3 + D(x +1)^2(x -1)^3 + E(x +1)(x -1)^3 + F(x -1)^3.\n\nThis seems quite involved. Maybe there's a smarter way. Alternatively, notice that the expression might be related to derivatives of simpler fractions.\n\nAlternatively, consider that (x² -1)^3 is symmetric in x and -x. Maybe the numerator is also symmetric. Let's check: 3x² +1 is even in x, so the expression is even. Therefore, the partial fractions should reflect that symmetry. So A = -D, B = -E, C = F, etc.\n\nBut perhaps another approach: Let me compute the derivative of some function related to 1/(x² -1)^2. Let me see. Let’s think about integrating or differentiating known terms.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the sum is over n from 1 to ∞ of [2(48n² +1)]/(16n² -1)^3. Let me factor 2 out: 2 * Σ [48n² +1]/(16n² -1)^3.\n\nLet me compute [48n² +1] = 3*(16n²) +1 - 3*(16n²) +48n²? Wait, 48n² = 3*16n², which is 3*(16n²). So 48n² +1 = 3*(16n²) +1 = 3*(16n² -1) +3 +1 = 3*(16n² -1) +4. Therefore:\n\n[48n² +1]/(16n² -1)^3 = [3*(16n² -1) +4]/(16n² -1)^3 = 3/(16n² -1)^2 +4/(16n² -1)^3.\n\nTherefore, the sum becomes 2*Σ_{n=1}^∞ [3/(16n² -1)^2 +4/(16n² -1)^3].\n\nSo, now we have to compute Σ_{n=1}^∞ 1/(16n² -1)^2 and Σ_{n=1}^∞ 1/(16n² -1)^3.\n\nHmm. Let's factor 16n² -1 = (4n -1)(4n +1). Let me write 16n² -1 = (4n)^2 -1. So, similar to n² - m².\n\nI recall that sums over 1/(n² -a²) can sometimes be expressed using cotangent or other trigonometric functions, but for higher powers like squared or cubed, it's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express 1/(16n² -1) = 1/( (4n)^2 -1 ) = [1/(2(4n -1)) ] - [1/(2(4n +1)) ]. Let's verify:\n\n1/( (4n -1)(4n +1) ) = [1/(2(4n -1)) ] - [1/(2(4n +1)) ].\n\nYes, because:\n\n[1/(4n -1) - 1/(4n +1)] /2 = [ (4n +1 -4n +1) / ( (4n -1)(4n +1) ) ] /2 = [2 / ( (4n -1)(4n +1) ) ] /2 = 1 / ( (4n -1)(4n +1) ).\n\nTherefore, 1/(16n² -1) = [1/(2(4n -1)) ] - [1/(2(4n +1)) ].\n\nTherefore, maybe we can use this to express higher powers via differentiation.\n\nLet me consider f(a) = Σ_{n=1}^∞ 1/( (4n)^2 - a² ). Then, perhaps differentiating f(a) with respect to a could give expressions involving higher powers.\n\nBut this might not be straightforward. Alternatively, note that 16n² -1 = (4n -1)(4n +1). So 1/(16n² -1) = [1/(2(4n -1)) ] - [1/(2(4n +1)) ] as above.\n\nTherefore, 1/(16n² -1)^2 can be written as [1/(2(4n -1)) - 1/(2(4n +1)) ]^2. Expanding this would give terms like 1/(4(4n -1)^2) - 1/(2(4n -1)(4n +1)) +1/(4(4n +1)^2).\n\nSimilarly for 1/(16n² -1)^3, expanding would get even more terms. This seems complicated, but perhaps telescoping can occur when summed over n.\n\nAlternatively, consider the sum Σ_{n=1}^∞ 1/(16n² -1)^k for k=2 and 3. Maybe relate these sums to the digamma function or polygamma functions, which are derivatives of the logarithm of the gamma function.\n\nThe digamma function ψ(z) is the derivative of ln Γ(z). The polygamma functions are higher derivatives. I recall that sums like Σ_{n=0}^∞ 1/(n + a) = -ψ(a) + some constants, but for our case, the sum involves 1/(4n ±1). Let's see.\n\nFor example, Σ_{n=1}^∞ 1/(4n -1) = (1/4) Σ_{n=1}^∞ 1/(n - 1/4) = (1/4) [ ψ(1 -1/4) - ψ(1 -1/4) ]... Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, use partial fractions and express the sum in terms of the Riemann zeta function or other known series. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's recall that the original sum was expressed in terms of ζ(2k+2). The problem's identity relates a sum over k involving ζ(2k+2) to π³/32. Since ζ(2k) is related to Bernoulli numbers and π^{2k}, perhaps there is a generating function that connects these sums to π³.\n\nAlternatively, consider integrating some function that gives rise to the zeta function terms. For example, integrals involving trigonometric functions or logarithmic functions can sometimes be expanded into series involving ζ values.\n\nWait, here's an idea: The sum involves ζ(2k+2) for k starting at 1. ζ(2k+2) = Σ_{m=1}^∞ 1/m^{2k+2}. So, swapping the sum over k and m, we have Σ_{m=1}^∞ Σ_{k=1}^∞ [2k(2k+1)/(4^{2k+2} m^{2k+2})].\n\nLet me compute the inner sum Σ_{k=1}^∞ 2k(2k+1)/(4^{2k+2} m^{2k+2}).\n\nFactor out 1/(4^{2} m^{2}) = 1/(16 m²), so the inner sum becomes 1/(16 m²) Σ_{k=1}^∞ 2k(2k+1)/(16^k m^{2k}).\n\nLet x = 1/(16 m²). Then the inner sum is 1/(16 m²) Σ_{k=1}^∞ 2k(2k+1) x^k.\n\nAs before, we found that Σ_{k=1}^∞ 2k(2k+1) x^k = (6x + 2x²)/(1 -x)^3.\n\nSubstituting x =1/(16 m²):\n\n(6*(1/(16 m²)) + 2*(1/(16 m²))² ) / (1 -1/(16 m²))³\n\nSimplify numerator: 6/(16 m²) + 2/(256 m^4) = 3/(8 m²) + 1/(128 m^4).\n\nDenominator: ( (16 m² -1)/16 m² )³ = (16 m² -1)^3 / (16 m²)^3.\n\nTherefore, the inner sum is [3/(8 m²) + 1/(128 m^4)] / [ (16 m² -1)^3 / (16 m²)^3 ] = [3/(8 m²) + 1/(128 m^4)] * (16 m²)^3 / (16 m² -1)^3.\n\nCompute (16 m²)^3 = 4096 m^6.\n\nSo, numerator becomes 3/(8 m²) * 4096 m^6 + 1/(128 m^4) *4096 m^6 = 3*512 m^4 + 32 m² = 1536 m^4 +32 m².\n\nTherefore, inner sum is (1536 m^4 +32 m²)/ (16 m² -1)^3 = 32 m²(48 m² +1)/ (16 m² -1)^3.\n\nTherefore, the total sum is Σ_{m=1}^∞ [32 m²(48 m² +1)] / [16 m²(16 m² -1)^3 ].\n\nSimplify 32 m² /16 m² = 2. So the sum becomes Σ_{m=1}^∞ [2(48 m² +1)] / (16 m² -1)^3.\n\nWait, this is the same expression we had before. So we come back to the same point. Therefore, this approach might not be sufficient.\n\nPerhaps we need to evaluate this sum Σ_{m=1}^∞ [2(48 m² +1)] / (16 m² -1)^3. Let me compute it for some small m and see if there's a pattern.\n\nFor m=1: 2*(48 +1)/(16 -1)^3 = 2*49/15^3 = 98/3375 ≈0.029.\n\nFor m=2: 2*(48*4 +1)/(64 -1)^3 = 2*193/63^3 ≈386/250047≈0.00154.\n\nFor m=3: 2*(48*9 +1)/(144 -1)^3 =2*433/143^3≈866/2924207≈0.000296.\n\nSo the terms are decreasing rapidly. Sum of these terms is about 0.029 +0.00154 +0.000296 +... ≈0.0308. So the total sum is approximately 0.0308, and 1 -0.0308≈0.9692. Now, π³/32 ≈ (31.006)/32≈0.969, which matches. So numerically, the identity holds.\n\nBut we need to prove it analytically. Another approach could be to use the Fourier series or some integral representation of π³.\n\nAlternatively, consider the generating function for ζ(2k+2). I know that Σ_{k=1}^∞ ζ(2k) x^{2k} = (1/2)[1 - πx cot(πx)]. But here we have ζ(2k+2) and extra factors.\n\nWait, let's recall that for |x| <1, Σ_{k=1}^∞ ζ(2k) x^{2k} = (1/2)(1 - πx cot(πx)).\n\nSimilarly, Σ_{k=1}^∞ ζ(2k+1) x^{2k+1} = ... but that's more complicated. However, in our case, we have ζ(2k+2) multiplied by k terms.\n\nLet me consider the sum S = Σ_{k=1}^∞ [2k(2k+1)/4^{2k+2}] ζ(2k+2).\n\nNote that 4^{2k+2} = 16^{k+1} =16*16^k. So S = (1/16) Σ_{k=1}^∞ [2k(2k+1)/16^k] ζ(2k+2).\n\nExpress ζ(2k+2) as Σ_{n=1}^∞ 1/n^{2k+2}:\n\nS = (1/16) Σ_{k=1}^∞ Σ_{n=1}^∞ [2k(2k+1)/16^k] *1/n^{2k+2}.\n\nSwap sums:\n\nS = (1/16) Σ_{n=1}^∞ Σ_{k=1}^∞ [2k(2k+1)]/(16^k n^{2k+2}).\n\nLet x =1/(16 n²). Then, each term becomes:\n\nΣ_{k=1}^∞ 2k(2k+1) x^k /n².\n\nBut x =1/(16 n²), so x^k =1/(16^k n^{2k}), hence the term is [Σ_{k=1}^∞ 2k(2k+1) x^k ] /n² = [ (6x +2x²)/(1 -x)^3 ] /n², as before.\n\nSubstituting x=1/(16 n²), this becomes [6/(16 n²) + 2/(16 n²)^2 ] / (1 -1/(16 n²))^3 *1/n².\n\nWait, this seems similar to previous steps. But perhaps there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, consider differentiating the generating function for ζ(2k+2).\n\nLet’s consider f(x) = Σ_{k=1}^∞ ζ(2k+2) x^{2k}.\n\nFrom known generating functions, maybe relate this to an integral involving cotangent or something else.\n\nBut I know that Σ_{k=1}^∞ ζ(2k) x^{2k} = (1/2)(1 - πx cot(πx)).\n\nSimilarly, differentiating both sides with respect to x:\n\nΣ_{k=1}^∞ 2k ζ(2k) x^{2k-1} = (1/2)( -π cot(πx) - πx (-π csc^2(πx)) )\n\nWait, but our sum involves ζ(2k+2), which is similar to shifting the index. Let’s let m = k+1, then Σ_{k=1}^∞ ζ(2k+2) x^{2k} = Σ_{m=2}^∞ ζ(2m) x^{2m -2} } = x^{-2} [ Σ_{m=2}^∞ ζ(2m) x^{2m} } ] = x^{-2} [ Σ_{m=1}^∞ ζ(2m) x^{2m} - ζ(2) x² ].\n\nUsing the known generating function:\n\n= x^{-2} [ (1/2)(1 - πx cot(πx)) - ζ(2) x² ].\n\nBut this still includes ζ(2), which is π²/6. So:\n\nΣ_{k=1}^∞ ζ(2k+2) x^{2k} = (1/(2x²))(1 - πx cot(πx)) - ζ(2)/x² * x² /2.\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, Σ_{m=1}^∞ ζ(2m) x^{2m} = (1/2)(1 - πx cot(πx)).\n\nTherefore, Σ_{m=2}^∞ ζ(2m) x^{2m} = (1/2)(1 - πx cot(πx)) - ζ(2) x².\n\nTherefore, Σ_{k=1}^∞ ζ(2k+2) x^{2k} = [ (1/2)(1 - πx cot(πx)) - ζ(2) x² ] / x².\n\n= (1/(2x²))(1 - πx cot(πx)) - ζ(2).\n\nBut in our problem, the sum S involves Σ_{k=1}^∞ [2k(2k+1)/4^{2k+2}] ζ(2k+2) = Σ_{k=1}^∞ [2k(2k+1)/16^{k+1}] ζ(2k+2).\n\nLet me set x =1/4, since 16^{k+1} =4^{2(k+1)} = (4^2)^{k+1} =16^{k+1}, but perhaps not. Wait, 4^{2k+2} = (4^2)^{k+1} =16^{k+1}, so 1/16^{k+1} = (1/4)^{2k+2} =x^{2k+2} where x=1/4.\n\nWait, no. Let me see: If I let x=1/4, then x^{2k} = (1/4)^{2k} =1/16^k. So our term [2k(2k+1)/16^{k+1}] = [2k(2k+1)/16 *16^k} ]= [2k(2k+1)/16} ]*(1/16)^k = [ (2k(2k+1))/16 } ]x^{2k} where x=1/4.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Perhaps use the generating function f(x) = Σ_{k=1}^∞ ζ(2k+2) x^{2k} and relate it to the desired sum.\n\nFrom earlier, we have f(x) = Σ_{k=1}^∞ ζ(2k+2) x^{2k} = [ (1/2)(1 - πx cot(πx)) - ζ(2) x² ] / x².\n\nSo, to get Σ_{k=1}^∞ [2k(2k+1)] ζ(2k+2) x^{2k}, we can differentiate f(x).\n\nFirst, note that:\n\nΣ_{k=1}^∞ [2k(2k+1)] ζ(2k+2) x^{2k} = Σ_{k=1}^∞ [2k(2k+1)] ζ(2k+2) x^{2k}.\n\nLet’s denote m =k, then this is Σ_{m=1}^∞ [2m(2m+1)] ζ(2m+2) x^{2m}.\n\nLet’s relate this to derivatives of f(x). Note that:\n\nx f'(x) = Σ_{m=1}^∞ 2m ζ(2m+2) x^{2m}.\n\nThen, differentiating again:\n\nd/dx [x f'(x)] = Σ_{m=1}^∞ (2m)^2 ζ(2m+2) x^{2m-1}.\n\nBut our sum has terms 2m(2m+1) x^{2m}. Let’s see:\n\nLet’s compute:\n\nd/dx [x^2 f'(x)] = 2x f'(x) +x^2 f''(x).\n\nBut I need to get 2m(2m+1) x^{2m} terms. Alternatively, consider operating with x d/dx twice.\n\nLet’s compute:\n\nFirst derivative: x d/dx f(x) = Σ_{m=1}^∞ 2m ζ(2m+2) x^{2m}.\n\nSecond derivative: x d/dx [x d/dx f(x)] = x d/dx [Σ_{m=1}^∞ 2m ζ(2m+2) x^{2m}] = x Σ_{m=1}^∞ (2m)^2 ζ(2m+2) x^{2m-1} } = Σ_{m=1}^∞ (2m)^2 ζ(2m+2) x^{2m}.\n\nBut our desired sum is Σ_{m=1}^∞ 2m(2m+1) ζ(2m+2) x^{2m} = Σ_{m=1}^∞ [ (2m)^2 + 2m ] ζ(2m+2) x^{2m} = x d/dx [x d/dx f(x)} ] + x d/dx f(x).\n\nTherefore, the desired sum is x d/dx [x d/dx f(x)} ] + x d/dx f(x).\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nLet G = x d/dx f(x) = Σ 2m ζ x^{2m}.\n\nThen, x d/dx G = Σ (2m)^2 ζ x^{2m}.\n\nThus, desired sum is x d/dx G + G = Σ [ (2m)^2 + 2m ] ζ x^{2m} = Σ 2m(2m +1) ζ x^{2m}.\n\nSo, the desired sum S is (x d/dx G + G) evaluated at x=1/4.\n\nBut we need to compute this expression using the generating function f(x).\n\nGiven that f(x) = [ (1/2)(1 - πx cot πx ) - ζ(2)x² ] /x².\n\nLet me compute f(x):\n\nf(x) = (1 - πx cot πx )/(2x²) - ζ(2)/x² * x² /2.\n\nWait, no:\n\nOriginal expression:\n\nΣ_{k=1}^∞ ζ(2k+2) x^{2k} = [ (1/2)(1 - πx cot πx ) - ζ(2) x² ] / x².\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n(1/2)(1 - πx cot πx ) - ζ(2) x².\n\nTherefore, f(x) = [1/(2x²)](1 - πx cot πx ) - ζ(2)/x².\n\nBut this seems off. Wait, original expression was:\n\nΣ_{k=1}^∞ ζ(2k+2) x^{2k} = [ (1/2)(1 - πx cot πx ) - ζ(2) x² ] / x².\n\n= (1 - πx cot πx )/(2x²) - ζ(2).\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo f(x) = (1 - πx cot πx )/(2x²) - ζ(2).\n\nNow, we need to compute G = x f'(x).\n\nFirst, compute f'(x):\n\nf(x) = (1 - πx cot πx )/(2x²) - ζ(2).\n\nDifferentiate term by term:\n\nd/dx [ (1 - πx cot πx )/(2x²) ].\n\nLet’s denote numerator as N =1 - πx cot πx.\n\nThen, d/dx [N/(2x²)] = (N’ *2x² - N *4x )/(2x⁴).\n\nWait, using quotient rule:\n\nd/dx [N/(2x²)} ] = (N’ *2x² - N *4x )/( (2x²)^2 )? Wait, no. Wait, quotient rule: d/dx [N/D] = (N’ D - N D’)/D².\n\nHere, N =1 - πx cot πx, D=2x².\n\nThus:\n\nd/dx [N/D] = [ ( -π cot πx - πx (-π csc² πx * π )) * 2x² - (1 - πx cot πx)*4x ] / (2x²)^2.\n\nWait, this is getting messy. Let's compute N’:\n\nN =1 - πx cot πx.\n\nN’ = -π cot πx - πx * d/dx (cot πx).\n\nd/dx (cot πx) = -π csc² πx.\n\nThus, N’ = -π cot πx + π² x csc² πx.\n\nTherefore, N’ = π ( -cot πx + πx csc² πx ).\n\nThen, D=2x², D’=4x.\n\nThus, d/dx [N/D] = [ N’ * D - N * D’ ] / D² = [ π(-cot πx + πx csc² πx)*2x² - (1 - πx cot πx)*4x ] / (4x⁴).\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n2x² π(-cot πx + πx csc² πx) -4x (1 - πx cot πx).\n\n= -2π x² cot πx + 2π² x³ csc² πx -4x +4π x² cot πx.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(-2π x² cot πx +4π x² cot πx ) +2π² x³ csc² πx -4x\n\n=2π x² cot πx +2π² x³ csc² πx -4x.\n\nTherefore, d/dx [N/D] = [2π x² cot πx +2π² x³ csc² πx -4x ] / (4x⁴).\n\n= [2π x² cot πx +2π² x³ csc² πx -4x ] / (4x⁴).\n\nFactor out 2x:\n\n= 2x [ π x cot πx + π² x² csc² πx -2 ] / (4x⁴).\n\n= [ π x cot πx + π² x² csc² πx -2 ] / (2x³).\n\nThe derivative of the other term in f(x) is d/dx [ -ζ(2) ] =0.\n\nThus, f’(x) = [ π x cot πx + π² x² csc² πx -2 ] / (2x³).\n\nTherefore, G = x f’(x) = [ π x cot πx + π² x² csc² πx -2 ] / (2x²).\n\nNow, compute G = x f’(x) = [ π cot πx + π² x csc² πx -2/x ] / (2x).\n\nThen, we need to compute x d/dx G + G.\n\nFirst, compute x d/dx G:\n\nLet’s differentiate G with respect to x:\n\nG = [ π cot πx + π² x csc² πx -2/x ] / (2x).\n\nLet me write G as [A + B + C]/2x, where:\n\nA = π cot πx,\n\nB = π² x csc² πx,\n\nC = -2/x.\n\nDifferentiate G:\n\ndG/dx = [ derivative of (A + B + C)/2x ].\n\nUse the quotient rule:\n\nLet’s denote numerator = A + B + C, denominator =2x.\n\ndG/dx = [ (A’ + B’ + C’) *2x - (A + B + C)*2 ] / (2x)^2.\n\nCompute A’:\n\nA = π cot πx,\n\nA’ = -π^2 csc² πx.\n\nB = π² x csc² πx,\n\nB’ = π² csc² πx + π² x * d/dx(csc² πx).\n\nd/dx(csc² πx) = -2π csc² πx cot πx.\n\nThus, B’ = π² csc² πx + π² x*(-2π csc² πx cot πx).\n\n= π² csc² πx - 2π^3 x csc² πx cot πx.\n\nC = -2/x,\n\nC’ = 2/x².\n\nTherefore, A’ + B’ + C’ = -π^2 csc² πx + π² csc² πx - 2π^3 x csc² πx cot πx + 2/x².\n\n= (-π^2 csc² πx + π² csc² πx) + (-2π^3 x csc² πx cot πx) + 2/x².\n\n= 0 -2π^3 x csc² πx cot πx + 2/x².\n\nThus, numerator of dG/dx:\n\n[ ( -2π^3 x csc² πx cot πx + 2/x² ) *2x - (π cot πx + π² x csc² πx -2/x )*2 ] / (4x²).\n\nSimplify:\n\nFirst term: (-2π^3 x csc² πx cot πx + 2/x² ) *2x = -4π^3 x² csc² πx cot πx +4/x.\n\nSecond term: - (π cot πx + π² x csc² πx -2/x )*2 = -2π cot πx -2π² x csc² πx +4/x.\n\nThus, total numerator:\n\n(-4π^3 x² csc² πx cot πx +4/x) -2π cot πx -2π² x csc² πx +4/x.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-4π^3 x² csc² πx cot πx -2π cot πx -2π² x csc² πx + (4/x +4/x).\n\n= -4π^3 x² csc² πx cot πx -2π cot πx -2π² x csc² πx +8/x.\n\nTherefore, dG/dx = [ -4π^3 x² csc² πx cot πx -2π cot πx -2π² x csc² πx +8/x ] / (4x²).\n\nThen, x d/dx G = x * [ numerator ] / (4x²) = numerator / (4x).\n\nSo x d/dx G = [ -4π^3 x² csc² πx cot πx -2π cot πx -2π² x csc² πx +8/x ] / (4x).\n\nSimplify:\n\n= [ -π^3 x csc² πx cot πx - (π/2x) cot πx - (π²/2) csc² πx +2/x² ].\n\nNow, compute x d/dx G + G:\n\nG = [ π cot πx + π² x csc² πx -2/x ] / (2x).\n\nSo x d/dx G + G = [ -π^3 x csc² πx cot πx - (π/2x) cot πx - (π²/2) csc² πx +2/x² ] + [ π cot πx + π² x csc² πx -2/x ] / (2x).\n\nWait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe evaluate at x=1/4.\n\nThe original sum S is (1/16) times the desired sum evaluated at x=1/4.\n\nWait, recall that our sum S is:\n\nS = (1/16) * Σ_{k=1}^∞ [2k(2k+1)/16^k] ζ(2k+2) = (1/16) * [x d/dx G + G] evaluated at x=1/4.\n\nBut this approach is leading to very complex expressions. Perhaps there is a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, consider known series for π³. For example, integrals involving π³ or known series representations.\n\nWait, I recall that there's a formula involving the Dirichlet beta function, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, consider integrating the sum term by term.\n\nAlternatively, let's recall that the original identity is:\n\nπ³/32 =1 - Σ_{k=1}^∞ [2k(2k+1) ζ(2k+2)/4^{2k+2}}.\n\nRearrange to:\n\nΣ_{k=1}^∞ [2k(2k+1) ζ(2k+2)/4^{2k+2}} =1 - π³/32.\n\nThus, we need to show that the sum equals 1 - π³/32.\n\nPerhaps consider evaluating the sum as an integral. Since ζ(2k+2) is Σ_{n=1}^∞ 1/n^{2k+2}, and swapping sums:\n\nΣ_{k=1}^∞ Σ_{n=1}^∞ [2k(2k+1)/(4^{2k+2} n^{2k+2}}.\n\nAs before, this becomes Σ_{n=1}^∞ Σ_{k=1}^∞ [2k(2k+1)/(16^{k+1} n^{2k+2}}.\n\nWhich we evaluated earlier as Σ_{n=1}^∞ [2(48n² +1)]/(16n² -1)^3.\n\nBut perhaps compute this sum using residues or another advanced technique.\n\nAlternatively, note that 16n² -1 = (4n -1)(4n +1). So, maybe partial fractions or using telescoping with the terms involving 4n ±1.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the sum resembles a telescoping series when expressed in terms of 1/(4n -1) and 1/(4n +1).\n\nBut given the time I've spent and the complexity, perhaps the answer lies in recognizing this sum as related to a known series expansion of π³ involving the zeta functions or through integrating a function whose series expansion gives the required terms.\n\nAlternatively, consider the integral of x^3 cot x or something similar, but I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the fact that the numerical evaluation aligns with π³/32, I think the key steps involve expressing the sum in terms of known generating functions of the zeta function and manipulating those to arrive at the result. However, providing a complete proof here would be quite involved and might require referencing advanced techniques or known series identities.",
