    "Content": "Can someone point me to a paper, or show here, why symmetric matrices have orthogonal eigenvectors? In particular, I'd like to see proof that for a symmetric matrix $A$ there exists decomposition $A = Q\\Lambda Q^{-1} = Q\\Lambda Q^{T}$ where $\\Lambda$ is diagonal.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "For any real matrix $A$ and any vectors $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{y}$, we have\n$$\\langle A\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y}\\rangle = \\langle\\mathbf{x},A^T\\mathbf{y}\\rangle.$$\nNow assume that $A$ is symmetric, and $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{y}$ are eigenvectors of $A$ corresponding to distinct eigenvalues $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$. Then\n$$\\lambda\\langle\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y}\\rangle = \\langle\\lambda\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y}\\rangle = \\langle A\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y}\\rangle = \\langle\\mathbf{x},A^T\\mathbf{y}\\rangle = \\langle\\mathbf{x},A\\mathbf{y}\\rangle = \\langle\\mathbf{x},\\mu\\mathbf{y}\\rangle = \\mu\\langle\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y}\\rangle.$$\nTherefore, $(\\lambda-\\mu)\\langle\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y}\\rangle = 0$. Since $\\lambda-\\mu\\neq 0$, then $\\langle\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y}\\rangle = 0$, i.e., $\\mathbf{x}\\perp\\mathbf{y}$. Now find an orthonormal basis for each eigenspace; since the eigenspaces are mutually orthogonal, these vectors together give an orthonormal subset of $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Finally, since symmetric matrices are diagonalizable, this set will be a basis (just count dimensions). The result you want now follows.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original question is about why symmetric matrices have orthogonal eigenvectors and the existence of the decomposition A = QΛQ^T. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The key points here are that the matrix A is real and symmetric. The problem is to prove two things: that the eigenvectors are orthogonal and that A can be decomposed into QΛQ^T where Q is orthogonal and Λ is diagonal.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property. So for this problem, the main assumptions are that A is a real matrix and that A is symmetric. These are two separate properties applied to the same object, matrix A. \n\nThe problem statement then combines both parts mentioned in the question: proving the orthogonality of eigenvectors and the existence of the decomposition. But wait, in the example, the assumption included a condition on n (divisible by 7), which was part of the problem's original assumptions. Here, the original question doesn't state any additional conditions beyond A being real and symmetric. So the assumptions should just be those two properties.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is a single line. So \"A is a real matrix\" and \"A is a symmetric matrix\" would be two separate lines. Then the problem is to prove both the orthogonal eigenvectors and the decomposition. The question mentions showing why symmetric matrices have orthogonal eigenvectors and the existence of the decomposition. So the problem part should include both aspects as stated.\n\nWait, the user's example formatted the problem as \"Prove that... is divisible by 91\" which combines multiple aspects into one problem statement. Similarly, here, the problem should be stated as proving that for a real symmetric matrix A, there exists a decomposition A = QΛQ^T with Q orthogonal and Λ diagonal, and that the eigenvectors are orthogonal. But the original question mentions both the decomposition and the orthogonality of eigenvectors. So maybe the problem statement should include both. However, in linear algebra, the spectral theorem states that real symmetric matrices are diagonalizable by an orthogonal matrix, which implies the eigenvectors can be chosen to be orthogonal. So the decomposition part and the orthogonality are connected. Therefore, the problem is to prove that a real symmetric matrix A has orthogonal eigenvectors and admits such a decomposition.\n\nBut the user's example didn't split the problem into multiple parts; it combined the conditions. So perhaps the problem here is to show both the decomposition and the orthogonality. The original question says, \"why symmetric matrices have orthogonal eigenvectors\" and \"show proof that there exists decomposition...\". So the problem statement should include both. Therefore, the formatted problem would have the assumptions as A being real and symmetric, and the problem is to prove the existence of the decomposition and the orthogonality of eigenvectors.\n\nI need to check if there are any other assumptions. The original question doesn't mention anything else. So the assumptions are just the two properties of A. Then the problem is to prove both points mentioned. So the final answer should list those two assumptions and the combined problem statement.",
