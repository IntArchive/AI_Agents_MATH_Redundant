    "AcceptedAnswer": "Hint : I will show it for 3-digit and you will know the general trend. $(666)^2 + 888 = 36(111)^2 + 8(111) = 111(36(111) + 8) = 444(9(111) + 2) = 444(1001) = 444444$ Basically you will always get $44\\ldots4$ ($n$ times) common times $100\\ldots1$ ($n-1$ zeroes) which will help repeating the digits. You can write a formal proof using this idea very easily. Let $e_n$ be the integer with $n$ $1s$. Substitute $e_n$ for $111$ in proof above and note that $9e_n+2=10^n+1$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to prove that the square of a number composed of n copies of 6 plus a number composed of n copies of 8 equals a number composed of 2n copies of 4. \n\nFirst, I need to represent these numbers mathematically. The number with n 6s can be written as 6 times a number with n 1s. Similarly, the number with n 8s is 8 times a number with n 1s. The number with 2n 4s is 4 times a number with 2n 1s. \n\nSo, let's denote the number with k digits all 1s as (10^k - 1)/9. For example, 11...1 (k times) = (10^k - 1)/9. Therefore:\n\n- The number with n 6s: 6 * (10^n - 1)/9\n- The number with n 8s: 8 * (10^n - 1)/9\n- The number with 2n 4s: 4 * (10^{2n} - 1)/9\n\nThe equation becomes:\n\n[6*(10^n -1)/9]^2 + 8*(10^n -1)/9 = 4*(10^{2n} -1)/9\n\nSimplifying the left-hand side (LHS):\n\nFirst, square the first term:\n\n(6^2) * [(10^n -1)/9]^2 = 36 * [(10^n -1)^2]/81 = 4 * [(10^n -1)^2]/9\n\nThen add the second term:\n\n4*(10^n -1)^2/9 + 8*(10^n -1)/9 \n\nFactor out 4*(10^n -1)/9:\n\n[4*(10^n -1)/9] * [ (10^n -1) + 2 ]\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n(10^n -1) + 2 = 10^n +1\n\nSo LHS becomes:\n\n4*(10^n -1)(10^n +1)/9 = 4*(10^{2n} -1)/9\n\nWhich is exactly the right-hand side (RHS). Hence, proved.\n\nWait, but the problem states that n is a positive integer, so the assumption is just that n is a positive integer. There's no additional condition like divisibility, so the example in the original problem might have included an extra assumption, but here, the only assumption is that n is a positive integer.",
