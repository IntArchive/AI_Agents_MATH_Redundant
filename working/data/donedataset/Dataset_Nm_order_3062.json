    "Content": "I think my question is not totally precise, because I am trying to make my intuition more rigorous: Take a continous function $f:D^2\\rightarrow D^2$ where $D^2$ means the two-dimensional disk. I am interested in the behaviour of $f$ on the boundary $\\partial D^2=S^1$ which I have drawn as a red circle. I think of $S^1$ in terms of the boundary of $D^2$ , hence I prefer to use the notation $\\partial D^2$ .\n(Let me make a bold simplifying assumption for now: $f(x)\\neq x$ on $\\partial D^2)$ If we restrict $f$ to $\\partial D^2$ , it has a codomain which is a closed curve that I call $f(\\partial D^2)$ . I have drawn $f(\\partial D^2)$ in blue colour. Each $x\\in \\partial D^2$ has an image $f(x)\\in f(\\partial D^2)$ . Each pair $(x,f(x))$ defines a vector. So we can say $f$ defines a vector field on $\\partial D^2$ . I have drawn five example vectors of this vector field in the diagram. (The simplifying assumption $f(x)\\neq x$ on $\\partial D^2$ means we don’t have to think about null vectors here.) Now let's travel once around the circle or boundary $\\partial D^2$ . If you move along the boundary, e.g. starting in $x_1$ , going clockwise along $\\partial D^2$ , until you are finally arriving back home at $x_1$ : I believe that, at the end of this journey, the corresponding vector $(x,f(x))$ has turned as well exactly once; in other words, I believe that this vector has made exactly one rotation . Is this correct, and which theorem does it correspond to? A few remarks, hopefully helpful and not distracting: (1) This vector turning around once feels to me almost like \"degree $1$ \" or \"winding number $1$ \", but I know that these invariants of $f$ are defined differently. So I do not know how to call it (maybe \"rotation induced by $f$ on $\\partial D^2$ \"). (2) This vector turning around once remains true even in special cases when $f$ is a constant function. In that case, it is even trivial that $(x,f(x))=(x,x_0)$ makes exactly one rotation. (3) This is similar to the \"Turning Tangent Theorem\" from Heinz Hopf (for example Continuity of homotopy in proof of Hopf's Umlaufsatz ). But obviously it is not the same, because I am not looking at tangents to $\\partial D^2$ , and the movement of my \"turning vector\" is determined by a function $f$ . (4) Why I believe the vector turns exactly once: It seems intuitively clear. And I think it is used in the proofs of Brouwer's fixed point theorem through Sperner's lemma. See for example Michael Henle: „A Combinatorial Introduction to Topology“; and similarly in Günter Ziegler and Martin Aigner: „Proofs from THE BOOK“.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You are correct, the vector you described will always make one rotation as $x$ goes around the circle. Furthermore, the rotation of the vector goes the same direction as the rotation of $x$ , so the winding number/degree of the path of this vector is $+1$ . Let $T_f(x)$ be the unit vector pointing in the direction from $x$ to $f(x)$ . That is, $$\nT_f(x)=\\frac{f(x)-x}{\\|f(x)-x\\|}.\n$$ Note that $T_f:\\partial D^2\\to \\partial D^2$ . This means that we can speak of the degree of $T_f$ , in the usual sense , which is equivalent to the winding number of $T_f$ around the origin. In order to answer your question, we must prove that $\\deg T_f=1$ . Now, let $g(x):\\partial D^2\\to D^2$ be constant map where $g(x)=\\vec 0$ for all $x\\in \\partial D^2$ . The functions $f$ and $g$ are homotopy equivalent, via the homotopy $$\nH(x,t)=(1-t)f(x).\n$$ Now, define $T_g:\\partial D^2\\to \\partial D^2$ analogously to $T_f$ . $$\nT_g(x)=\\frac{g(x)-x}{\\|g(x)-x\\|}=\\frac{-x}{\\|-x\\|}=-x. \n$$ We can use $H$ to construct a homotopy equivalence between $T_f$ and $T_g$ . The homotopy is $\\tilde H$ , defined by $$\n\\tilde H(x,t)= \\frac{H(x,t)-x}{\\|H(x,t)-x\\|}.\n$$ Since $T_f$ and $T_g$ are both maps from the circle to itself, they both have a degree. Since the two maps are homotopic, it is true that $\\deg T_f=\\deg T_g$ . Finally, you can check that $\\deg T_g=+1$ (in general, the map $\\eta:S_n\\to S_n$ defined by $\\eta(x)=-x$ has degree $(-1)^n$ ). We conclude that $\\deg T_f=+1$ , as claimed.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to break this down. The user is asking about a continuous function f from the closed disk D² to itself. They mentioned an assumption that f(x) ≠ x on the boundary ∂D². The main question is whether, when you move around the boundary circle once, the vector from x to f(x) rotates exactly once. They relate this to concepts like degree or winding number but aren't sure which theorem applies here.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the problem correctly. The key objects here are the function f, the disk D², its boundary S¹ (which they denote as ∂D²), and the vector field defined by (x, f(x)) on this boundary. The assumption is that f doesn't fix any point on the boundary, meaning f(x) ≠ x for all x in ∂D². The user is observing that as you traverse the boundary, the vector from x to f(x) seems to make exactly one full rotation. They mention examples like constant functions where this still holds, and they suspect it's related to proofs in Brouwer's fixed point theorem.\n\nSo, the assumptions I need to list should each address one property or condition applied to one object. Let's see:\n\n1. The function f is continuous from D² to D². That's a key condition.\n2. The function f does not fix any point on the boundary, i.e., f(x) ≠ x for all x in ∂D². That's their simplifying assumption.\n3. The problem is about the rotation of the vector field (x, f(x)) as x goes around ∂D² once. The question is whether this rotation is exactly once.\n\nWait, the problem statement in the original question is a bit more involved. Let me check again. The user wants to know if the vector (x, f(x)) makes exactly one full rotation as x travels around ∂D² once. They also mention that this seems to hold even for constant functions. For instance, if f is a constant function mapping every x to a fixed point x₀ in D², then the vector from x to x₀ would point from each boundary point to x₀. As you go around the boundary, these vectors would rotate once. So even in that case, the winding number is 1. That's an important clue.\n\nSo, the theorem they're referring to might relate to the degree of a map or the winding number. Specifically, if you consider the map that takes x in S¹ to (f(x) - x), then the winding number of this map around the origin should be 1. Since f(x) ≠ x on the boundary, the map (f(x) - x) never vanishes, so its winding number is defined. The user is asserting that this winding number is 1, which would correspond to the vector rotating once.\n\nBut which theorem states this? The user mentions the Turning Tangent Theorem by Hopf, which is about the rotation of tangent vectors to a closed curve, but here it's a different vector field. Another thought: if you have a map from S¹ to S¹, the degree is the number of times the image wraps around the circle. But in this case, f maps ∂D² to D², but the vector (f(x) - x) is a vector in the plane. So perhaps considering the map g(x) = (f(x) - x)/|f(x) - x|, which would be a map from S¹ to S¹, and the degree of this map is 1.\n\nWait, but how does that relate to Brouwer's fixed point theorem? Because Brouwer's theorem says that any continuous map from D² to D² has a fixed point, but here the assumption is that there are no fixed points on the boundary. So if there's a fixed point, it would be in the interior. The connection is that in proofs using degree theory, you show that if there's no fixed point, then the degree of the map g(x) = (x - f(x)) would lead to a contradiction. For example, if there's no fixed point, then you can define the map g: D² → S¹ by g(x) = (x - f(x))/|x - f(x)|. Restricting this to the boundary S¹, the degree of this map should be zero (since it extends to the disk), but if you can show that the degree is actually 1, that's a contradiction, implying there must be a fixed point.\n\nSo in this case, the degree of the map g: S¹ → S¹ defined by g(x) = (x - f(x))/|x - f(x)| is 1. That's exactly what the user is observing. Therefore, the theorem here is about the degree of this particular map, and it's related to the Brouwer fixed point theorem.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n- f: D² → D² is continuous.\n- For all x in ∂D², f(x) ≠ x.\n- The problem is to show that the map x ↦ f(x) - x, when normalized, has a winding number (degree) of 1 as x traverses ∂D² once.\n\nBut in the original problem, the user didn't explicitly state the problem as proving the winding number is 1, but rather asking if their intuition that the vector rotates exactly once is correct and which theorem it corresponds to. So the problem is to confirm that the winding number is 1 and identify the relevant theorem.\n\nTherefore, structuring the problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- f is a continuous function from D² to D².\n- For every x in ∂D², f(x) ≠ x.\n- The vector field on ∂D² is defined by the vectors (x, f(x)).\n\nProblem:\nProve that as x traverses ∂D² once, the vector (x, f(x)) makes exactly one full rotation, and identify the corresponding theorem.\n\nBut wait, the original problem's exact wording is: \"Is this correct, and which theorem does it correspond to?\"\n\nSo the problem is two-fold: confirm the rotation is exactly once, and name the theorem.\n\nNow, translating this into the required format.\n\nThe assumptions would be:\n\n1. f: D² → D² is continuous.\n2. For each x in ∂D², f(x) ≠ x.\n\nThese are two separate assumptions applied to the function f and its behavior on the boundary.\n\nThe problem is then: Determine whether the vector field defined by (x, f(x)) on ∂D² makes exactly one full rotation as x traverses ∂D² once, and identify the corresponding theorem.\n\nBut perhaps the problem statement can be phrased more concisely, as in the example.\n\nLooking back at the example, the problem was phrased as \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91.\" So here, the problem should be to prove that the winding number is 1, corresponding to the vector rotating once, and to identify the theorem.\n\nBut the user's question is phrased as: \"Is this correct, and which theorem does it correspond to?\"\n\nBut in the format, the problem should be the actual mathematical problem. So perhaps the problem is: \"Prove that the winding number of the vector field (x, f(x)) on ∂D² is 1, and identify the corresponding theorem.\"\n\nAlternatively, since the user states their belief and asks for confirmation and the theorem, the problem can be phrased as: \"Is it correct that the vector field (x, f(x)) on ∂D² makes exactly one full rotation as x traverses ∂D² once, and which theorem does this correspond to?\"\n\nBut the example used \"Prove that...\", so maybe it's better to structure the problem as a statement to prove. However, the original question is a yes/no question plus a request for a theorem. But since the format requires \"Problem: <The problem>\", perhaps it's better to rephrase the question into a problem statement. For example: \"Prove or disprove that the vector field defined by (x, f(x)) on ∂D² has a winding number of 1 as x traverses ∂D² once, and identify the corresponding theorem.\"\n\nBut I need to follow the example's structure, which in the example took the original problem's statement and rephrased it with the assumptions. The example had an original problem with a divisibility claim, and the formatted problem was to prove that expression is divisible by 91, with the assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7.\n\nIn this case, the original problem is more of a question: \"Is my intuition correct that the vector rotates exactly once, and which theorem does this correspond to?\"\n\nSo translating that into the problem statement, perhaps: \"Determine whether the vector field (x, f(x)) on ∂D² has a winding number of 1 as x traverses ∂D² once, and identify the corresponding theorem.\"\n\nAlternatively, if the user's problem is to confirm the rotation is once and find the theorem, the problem can be phrased as: \"Prove that the winding number of the vector field (x, f(x)) on ∂D² is 1 as x traverses ∂D² once, and state the corresponding theorem.\"\n\nBut the user hasn't phrased it as a proof but as a verification. However, the example transformed the original problem into a \"Prove that...\" statement. So perhaps we need to do the same here.\n\nGiven that, the formatted problem should capture the essence: proving the winding number is 1 and naming the theorem.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- f: D² → D² is a continuous function.\n- For all x in ∂D², f(x) ≠ x.\n\nProblem: Prove that the winding number of the vector field defined by x ↦ f(x) - x on ∂D² is 1, and identify the corresponding theorem.\n\nWait, but the user's vector is (x, f(x)), which they describe as vectors from x to f(x). So actually, the vector is f(x) - x, right? Because the vector from x to f(x) is f(x) - x. Therefore, the vector field is v(x) = f(x) - x. Since f(x) ≠ x on the boundary, this vector field never vanishes on ∂D², so the winding number is defined.\n\nTherefore, the winding number of v(x) = f(x) - x around the origin as x goes around ∂D² once is 1. That's the claim. The corresponding theorem would be related to the degree of such maps, possibly the Brouwer degree, or a specific application in fixed point theory.\n\nBut the theorem they're alluding to might be the one that connects the winding number to the fixed point property. Alternatively, it's part of the proof of Brouwer's fixed point theorem, where the assumption of no fixed points on the boundary leads to a contradiction via degree theory.\n\nTherefore, structuring the problem:\n\nAssumption:\n- f: D² → D² is continuous.\n- For every x in ∂D², f(x) ≠ x.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the winding number of the vector field x ↦ f(x) - x on ∂D² is 1, and state the corresponding theorem.\n\nAlternatively, the problem as per the user's question is to confirm the rotation is once and name the theorem, so maybe:\n\nProblem:\nIs the winding number of the vector field x ↦ f(x) - x on ∂D² equal to 1, and which theorem does this result correspond to?\n\nBut following the example's imperative style (\"Prove that...\"), perhaps it's better to phrase it as a statement to prove. Given the user's original question is a yes/no plus theorem identification, but the example rephrased the original problem into a \"Prove that...\" statement. So perhaps here, since the user believes it's correct, the problem is to prove it, hence:\n\nProblem:\nProve that the winding number of the vector field x ↦ f(x) - x on ∂D² is 1, and identify the corresponding theorem.\n\nYes, this seems to fit. The assumptions are clear, and the problem is to prove the winding number is 1 and name the theorem.\n\nNow, checking against the original question's content. The user mentions Sperner's lemma and references to Brouwer's fixed point theorem in Henle and Ziegler/Aigner's books. In those proofs, typically, you assume no fixed points on the boundary, then show that the degree is 1, leading to a contradiction if there's no fixed point inside, hence proving Brouwer's theorem. Therefore, the key point is that the degree/winding number is 1, which is used in proving Brouwer's theorem.\n\nThe corresponding theorem might be the Brouwer fixed point theorem itself, but the specific result about the winding number being 1 could be a lemma in its proof, often shown via homotopy or degree theory. Alternatively, it's related to the notion of the degree of a map on the circle, where if a map extends to the disk, its degree is zero, but here the assumption leads to degree 1, hence a contradiction.\n\nIn any case, the formatted problem should capture the assumptions and the task.",
