    "Content": "Let $C: x=x(t), y=y(t), a\\le t\\le b$ be a $C^1$ closed curve (not necessarily simple).The isoperimetric inequality says that\n $$ A\\le \\frac{\\ell^2}{4\\pi},$$ where $$A=\\left|\\int_C y(t)x'(t) dt\\right|$$ is the area enclosed by $C$, and \n$\\ell=\\int_a^b \\sqrt{(x'(t))^2+(y'(t))^2} dt$ is the arc length of $C$. \nMy question is how to use this theorem to prove  Wirtinger theorem: If $f(t)$ is a $T$-periodic $C^1$ real-valued function such that\n$\\int_0^T f(t) dt=0,$ then $$\\int_0^T |f(t)|^2 dt\\le \\frac{T^2}{4\\pi^2}\\int_0^T |f'(t)|^2 dt.$$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "First thing to note that if we re-parametrize $t = ks$, we have, by the chain rule,  $\\frac{d}{ds}f = k (\\frac{d}{dt}f)\\circ t$. Choose $k = T/(2\\pi)$, then the change of variable shows that it is sufficient to prove the claim for the period being $2\\pi$. That is, if we can show for any $2\\pi$ periodic function with mean 0 $$ \\int_0^{2\\pi} f^2 ds \\leq \\int_0^{2\\pi} |f'|^2 ds $$ we'll be done by a re-scaling argument. Since $f$ has mean 0, you can write $f = F'$ for $F$ another $2\\pi$ periodic function. So the isoperimetric inequality implies $$ \\left|\\int_0^{2\\pi} f F' ds \\right| \\leq \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\left( \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\sqrt{ (F')^2 + (f')^2 } ds \\right)^2 $$ or $$ \\int_0^{2\\pi} f^2 ds \\leq \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\left( \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\sqrt{f^2 + (f')^2} ds \\right)^2 $$ Now use Holder's inequality on the finite interval $[0,2\\pi]$, we get $$ \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\sqrt{f^2 + (f')^2} ds \\leq \\sqrt{2\\pi} \\left( \\int f^2 + (f')^2 ds \\right) $$ So we get $$ \\int_0^{2\\pi} f^2 ds \\leq \\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^{2\\pi} f^2 + (f')^2 ds $$ which, subtracting $\\frac12 \\int f^2$ from both sides yields the desired inequality. Now, a short remark on why it is necessary to first use the scaling argument. The principle is the following: Wirtinger's inequality, as discussed in the first paragraph above, is scale invariant: changing the scale of parameter $t$ changes the terms $f^2$ and $T^2 (f')^2$ equally. The isoperimetric inequality, however, is not scale invariant in the same way: using the ansatz where $x$ corresponds to $F$ and $y$ corresponds to $F' = f$, you see that a change of parametrization $t \\to ks$ will leave $x$ the same while changing $y$ by a multiple factor. In particular, this means that the depending on scale, the inequality may not be sharp. In other words, the changing of scale corresponds, morally speaking, to changing the $x$ and $y$ directions in different proportions. So if we start out with a circle, which is a maximizer of the isoperimetric inequality, after this funny reparametrisation which scales $x$ and $y$ differently, we end up with an ellipse, which no longer is a maximizer. The change of scale in the first paragraph allows us to \"use a version of the isoperimetric inequality as close to the circle version as possible\". In other words, by isolating the scale you can most efficiently use the isoperimetric inequality, which then allows for a simple proof of Wirtinger's inequality.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me start by reading the original question carefully.\n\nThe user is asking how to use the isoperimetric inequality to prove Wirtinger's theorem. The problem statement includes two main parts: the isoperimetric inequality and Wirtinger's inequality. The goal is to show that the former implies the latter.\n\nFirst, I need to extract all the assumptions. The assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nThe isoperimetric inequality is given for a C¹ closed curve C defined by x(t) and y(t) over [a, b]. The curve isn't necessarily simple. The area A is the absolute value of the integral of y(t)x'(t) dt, and the length ℓ is the integral of the square root of (x')² + (y')² dt. The inequality states that A ≤ ℓ²/(4π).\n\nThen, Wirtinger's theorem is about a T-periodic C¹ function f(t) with integral zero over [0, T], and the inequality involves the integrals of |f(t)|² and |f'(t)|². The user wants to connect these using the isoperimetric inequality.\n\nAssumptions here would include the conditions on the curve C for the isoperimetric inequality and the conditions on f(t) for Wirtinger's theorem. Let me list them one by one:\n\n1. The curve C is defined by x = x(t), y = y(t) for t in [a, b].\n2. The curve C is closed (since it's a closed curve).\n3. The curve C is of class C¹ (continuously differentiable).\n4. The curve is not necessarily simple (mentioned in the problem statement).\n5. The area A is given by the absolute value of the integral of y(t)x'(t) dt.\n6. The length ℓ is the integral of sqrt[(x'(t))² + (y'(t))²] dt from a to b.\n7. The isoperimetric inequality A ≤ ℓ²/(4π) holds under these conditions.\n\nFor Wirtinger's theorem:\n\n8. f(t) is a T-periodic function.\n9. f(t) is of class C¹.\n10. The integral of f(t) over [0, T] is zero.\n11. Wirtinger's inequality states that the integral of |f(t)|² dt from 0 to T is ≤ (T²/(4π²)) times the integral of |f'(t)|² dt from 0 to T.\n\nThe task is to use assumptions 1-7 (isoperimetric) to prove 8-11 (Wirtinger). But according to the example, the problem part should state the conclusion to prove, given the assumptions.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7, but in the formatted problem, the assumption lists both, but the problem part states to prove divisibility by 91. However, in the original problem here, the user is asking how to use the isoperimetric inequality (with its assumptions) to prove Wirtinger's theorem (with its own assumptions). So the problem is to derive Wirtinger's inequality under its conditions using the isoperimetric inequality.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should include all the conditions required for both theorems, but the problem is to prove Wirtinger's inequality given those conditions and using the isoperimetric inequality.\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem didn't mention that n is divisible by 7, but the formatted problem added it. Wait, no. Let me check the example again. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption includes \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", but that's not correct. Wait, maybe there was a mistake in the example. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7. That seems like an error. Wait, perhaps the example was a different problem. Let me check.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Then the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. But 91 is 7*13. So maybe the original problem actually had a missing condition that n is divisible by 7, or perhaps the user made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the formatted example is incorrect.\n\nBut regardless, the task here is to structure the given problem into assumptions and problem statement. So for the current problem about isoperimetric and Wirtinger's inequalities, the key is to list all assumptions from the problem.\n\nLooking back:\n\nThe problem states that C is a C¹ closed curve (not necessarily simple). The isoperimetric inequality applies here. Then, the task is to use this to prove Wirtinger's theorem where f is T-periodic, C¹, has integral zero, and then the inequality.\n\nSo the assumptions for Wirtinger's theorem are:\n\n- f is T-periodic.\n- f is C¹.\n- Integral of f over [0,T] is zero.\n\nBut to apply the isoperimetric inequality, we need to relate f to a curve. So perhaps the user's approach is to construct a curve using f(t) such that the isoperimetric inequality can be applied, leading to Wirtinger's inequality.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be both those for the isoperimetric inequality and those for Wirtinger's theorem. However, in the problem statement, the user is to use the isoperimetric theorem to prove Wirtinger's. Hence, the assumptions needed are those of Wirtinger's theorem, and perhaps the conditions for the isoperimetric are part of the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to assume the isoperimetric inequality and then, given the conditions of Wirtinger's theorem, prove the inequality. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- f is T-periodic.\n- f is C¹.\n- Integral of f over [0,T] is zero.\n\nBut the isoperimetric inequality's conditions (closed C¹ curve, etc.) are part of the method to apply, not necessarily assumptions of the problem to prove Wirtinger's. However, the problem asks to use the isoperimetric inequality, so perhaps the assumptions should include both the conditions on the curve (as they are needed to apply the isoperimetric inequality) and the conditions on f.\n\nWait, but the user wants to prove Wirtinger's theorem given that the isoperimetric holds. So the problem's assumptions would include the conditions under which the isoperimetric inequality is valid, and the conditions of Wirtinger's theorem.\n\nBut in the original problem statement, the user presents both the isoperimetric inequality (with its conditions) and Wirtinger's theorem (with its conditions). The task is to use the former to prove the latter. Therefore, the problem is: given that f satisfies the Wirtinger conditions (T-periodic, C¹, integral zero), use the isoperimetric inequality (which requires a closed C¹ curve) to derive the Wirtinger inequality.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions for the problem would be the conditions on f, and the problem is to prove the inequality using the isoperimetric theorem. However, the isoperimetric theorem itself has its own assumptions (the curve being closed, C¹, etc.), so when applying it, those would need to be satisfied by the constructed curve.\n\nHence, in structuring this, the assumptions would be the conditions on f, since those are the hypotheses of Wirtinger's theorem. The isoperimetric inequality is a given theorem that the user is supposed to apply. However, to apply it, we need to ensure that the curve constructed from f meets the conditions of the isoperimetric inequality.\n\nTherefore, the problem's assumptions are:\n\n- f is a T-periodic function.\n- f is of class C¹.\n- The integral of f over [0, T] is zero.\n\nThe problem is to prove the inequality using the isoperimetric inequality. However, the isoperimetric inequality's own assumptions (closed C¹ curve, etc.) are part of the method to be used, not the problem's assumptions. But since the problem requires using the isoperimetric inequality as given, perhaps those conditions are considered given and don't need to be listed as assumptions for the problem. Wait, but in the example, the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7, but in the formatted problem, that was added as an assumption. So perhaps in this case, the assistant should extract all necessary assumptions from the problem statement.\n\nWait, the original problem says: \"how to use this theorem [isoperimetric] to prove Wirtinger's theorem: If f(t) is a T-periodic C¹ real function with integral zero, then [inequality].\"\n\nSo the problem is: given f satisfies these conditions (T-periodic, C¹, integral zero), use the isoperimetric inequality (which is stated for closed C¹ curves) to prove the inequality. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. f is a T-periodic function.\n2. f is of class C¹.\n3. The integral of f over [0, T] is zero.\n\nThe problem is to prove the inequality involving the integrals of |f|² and |f'|².\n\nHowever, to apply the isoperimetric inequality, one must construct a closed C¹ curve from f, which would inherit the properties from f. Therefore, the key assumptions are those on f. The conditions for the curve (closed, C¹) would need to be satisfied by the construction using f. Since the problem states that C is a C¹ closed curve (not necessarily simple), those are part of the isoperimetric theorem's hypotheses. But in the problem to be formatted, the user is to list the assumptions of the problem (i.e., the hypotheses under which Wirtinger's theorem is to be proven), which are the conditions on f. The isoperimetric inequality is a given tool, so its conditions are part of the method, not the problem's assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the correct assumptions are those on f. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, the assumptions were that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect unless there was a typo. Because 91 is 7*13, so if n is divisible by 7, then 5^n and 6^n might have properties modulo 7 and 13. However, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so perhaps the formatted example is wrong. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the example. But regardless, I need to follow the instruction to list the assumptions of the problem as given.\n\nIn the current problem, the user is to use the isoperimetric inequality (which is stated for closed C¹ curves) to prove Wirtinger's theorem under the conditions that f is T-periodic, C¹, and has zero average. Therefore, the assumptions for the problem to be formatted are the conditions on f. The isoperimetric inequality's conditions are part of the theorem being used, not the problem's assumptions. Hence, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n$f(t)$ is a $T$-periodic function,\n$f(t)$ is of class $C^1$,\n$\\int_0^T f(t) dt = 0$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\int_0^T |f(t)|^2 dt \\le \\frac{T^2}{4\\pi^2} \\int_0^T |f'(t)|^2 dt$$ using the isoperimetric inequality.\n\nBut the original problem mentions that the curve C is not necessarily simple, which is part of the isoperimetric theorem's conditions. However, since the problem is to use that theorem, those conditions are part of the theorem's requirements, not the problem's assumptions. The user's task is to apply it to prove Wirtinger's, so the assumptions are on f.\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem didn't mention n divisible by 7, but the formatted problem included it. So maybe in this case, the assistant is supposed to include all necessary assumptions from the problem statement, even those that are part of the theorem being used. But that might not be correct. Let me think again.\n\nThe user provides the isoperimetric inequality as given, with its own assumptions (closed C¹ curve, etc.), and then asks to use this to prove Wirtinger's theorem, which has its own assumptions (f is T-periodic, C¹, integral zero). Therefore, the problem is to show that under Wirtinger's conditions on f, the inequality holds by using the isoperimetric inequality. Therefore, the assumptions are those on f, and the problem is to prove the inequality.\n\nBut to apply the isoperimetric inequality, one needs to construct a curve that satisfies its assumptions (closed, C¹). Therefore, when constructing the curve from f, those properties must be satisfied, which they would be because f is T-periodic and C¹, leading to a closed C¹ curve. Hence, the key assumptions are on f, and the problem is to prove the inequality using the isoperimetric theorem.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have assumptions on f and the problem statement to prove the inequality using the isoperimetric inequality. Hence, the correct structure is:\n\nAssumption:\n$f(t)$ is a $T$-periodic function,\n$f(t)$ is of class $C^1$,\n$\\int_0^T f(t) dt = 0$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\int_0^T |f(t)|^2 dt \\le \\frac{T^2}{4\\pi^2} \\int_0^T |f'(t)|^2 dt$$ using the isoperimetric inequality.\n\nBut the original problem statement mentions the isoperimetric inequality with area A and length ℓ. Therefore, maybe the problem should explicitly mention that the isoperimetric inequality is given, and the task is to prove Wirtinger's. However, according to the example, the problem part should restate the conclusion. In the example, the problem part was to prove divisibility by 91, which was the original problem's conclusion. Here, the conclusion is Wirtinger's inequality. So the formatted problem should have the assumptions as the conditions on f, and the problem part is to prove the inequality.\n\nBut the original problem also includes the isoperimetric inequality's statement. However, in the example, the formatted problem included the divisibility by 7 as an assumption, which was not in the original problem. That suggests that perhaps in structuring, we need to list all the necessary assumptions, even if they are part of the theorem being used. But that seems incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the example had an error, but I should follow the user's instruction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions should include both the conditions for the isoperimetric inequality (the curve being closed, C¹) and the conditions for Wirtinger's theorem. But in the problem statement, the user is to use the isoperimetric inequality (already given with its conditions) to prove Wirtinger's theorem. Therefore, the only assumptions are those on f, since the isoperimetric is a given tool.\n\nThus, the correct formatted problem would list the assumptions on f and then state the problem as proving the inequality using the isoperimetric inequality.",
