    "Content": "I am getting bored waiting for the train so I'm thinking whether there can exist a $C^1$ injective map between $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\\mathbb{R}$. It seems to me that the answer is no but I can't find a proof or a counterexample... Can you help me?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "There is no such map. If $f\\colon\\mathbb R^2\\to\\mathbb R$ is continuous then its image is connected, that is an interval in $\\mathbb R$. Note that this is a non-degenerate interval since the function is injective. However if you remove any point from $\\mathbb R^2$ it remains connected, however if we remove a point whose image is in the interior of the interval then the image cannot be still connected if the function is injective.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether there's a C¹ injective map from R² to R. Let's start by recalling some concepts. A C¹ function means it's continuously differentiable, right? So both the function and its derivatives are continuous. Injective means it's one-to-one; no two different points in R² map to the same point in R. \n\nFirst thought: The problem resembles the question of dimensionality. R² has a higher dimension than R, so intuitively, you can't have a continuous bijection between them because of invariance of domain theorem. But wait, the user is asking about an injective C¹ map, not necessarily a homeomorphism or a bijection. However, invariance of domain does say that any continuous injective map from R^n to R^m is open if m ≥ n, but here m=1 and n=2. So invariance of domain might imply that such a map can't exist because if it were injective and continuous, the image would have to be open in R, but R is one-dimensional, and the image would be a subset of R, which can't be open in R². Wait, maybe I need to check that again.\n\nAlternatively, thinking about differentiable functions. If such a map f: R² → R is C¹ and injective, then its differential (Jacobian) at each point should have full rank, which is 1 for a map to R. But the Jacobian matrix would be a 1x2 matrix, so the rank is at most 1. But injectivity requires that the derivative is injective as a linear map? Wait, no. For a function from R² to R, the derivative is a linear map from R² to R, which can't be injective because the dimension of the target is lower. So the derivative is not injective, but the function itself is injective. However, by the inverse function theorem, if the derivative were injective (which it can't be here), then the function would be a local diffeomorphism onto its image, which is not possible here. \n\nWait, but the inverse function theorem applies when the derivative is invertible, which in this case would require the derivative matrix to have maximal rank. For a function from R² to R, maximal rank is 1, so the inverse function theorem in this context would require that the derivative has rank 1 at a point, which would imply that locally, the function maps a 2D neighborhood onto a 1D interval, which is possible, but it can't be injective in higher dimensions. Wait, but if the function is injective, then even though the derivative has rank 1, how does that affect the global injectivity?\n\nAlternatively, maybe using Sard's theorem? The set of critical values has measure zero. But if the function is C¹ and injective, then the critical points are where the derivative has rank less than 1, i.e., where the gradient is zero. But if the gradient is zero at some point, then in a neighborhood around that point, the function is not injective because it's approximately constant. Wait, but that's only true if the function is constant, which it's not. Hmm, maybe not directly applicable.\n\nAnother approach: Suppose f: R² → R is injective and C¹. Then, the image of f must be an interval in R, since R² is connected and continuous image of connected is connected. But an interval in R is one-dimensional, and R² is two-dimensional. However, injective continuous maps from higher dimensions to lower can't exist because of invariance of domain, as I thought before. But invariance of domain is a topological result requiring the map to be continuous and injective, and it says that the image is open in the target space. But R is one-dimensional, so the image would have to be an open subset of R, which would be a union of open intervals. However, R² is connected, so the image must be a single open interval. But R² is also not compact, so the image could be all of R. But invariance of domain says that such a map cannot exist because it would imply that R is homeomorphic to an open subset of R², which is impossible since their dimensions differ. Wait, but the original problem is about a C¹ map, not just continuous. So maybe there's a different approach here.\n\nAlternatively, consider the case of a C¹ function from R² to R that's injective. Then, for each fixed x, the function f(x, y) would have to be strictly increasing or decreasing in y, and similarly for fixed y. But in R², along any line, the function would need to be monotonic. But can such a function exist? If you take a point and move in two different directions, can you maintain injectivity?\n\nWait, maybe using the mean value theorem. Suppose f is injective and C¹. Take two points a and b in R² such that f(a) = f(b). But since f is injective, a must equal b. So, for any two distinct points, their images are distinct. Now, consider the derivative. If we take two points a and b, and look at the line connecting them, then by the mean value theorem, there exists a point c on that line such that f(b) - f(a) = Df(c) · (b - a). Since f is injective, f(b) - f(a) ≠ 0 as long as a ≠ b. Therefore, the directional derivative in the direction of (b - a) at some point c must be non-zero. But the derivative Df(c) is a linear map from R² to R, which is represented by the gradient vector. The directional derivative in the direction of (b - a) is the dot product of the gradient and the direction vector. However, the gradient at c has some direction, and if we pick (b - a) orthogonal to the gradient, then the directional derivative would be zero, which would contradict the mean value theorem. But how can we ensure that for any two points a and b, there exists a point c where the directional derivative is non-zero?\n\nAlternatively, suppose the gradient is non-zero everywhere. Then, the function is a submersion at every point. But a submersion from R² to R would have each level set a 1-dimensional submanifold. But if the function is injective, then each level set should consist of a single point, which contradicts the fact that the level sets of a submersion are 1-dimensional. Therefore, such a function cannot be injective. Wait, this seems promising. If f is a C¹ function and a submersion (i.e., the gradient is non-zero everywhere), then the level sets are 1-dimensional submanifolds. But if f is injective, then each level set can only contain one point, which is impossible because the preimage of a point in R under a submersion must be a submanifold of dimension 2 - 1 = 1. So, that's a contradiction. Therefore, if such an injective C¹ map exists, it cannot be a submersion everywhere. But if there are points where the gradient is zero, then at those points, the function isn't a submersion.\n\nBut then, suppose f has critical points where the gradient is zero. If f is injective, then around those critical points, the function's behavior might be complicated. However, even if there are critical points, the function must still be injective globally. But the existence of critical points might lead to failure of injectivity in their neighborhoods. For example, consider a function f: R² → R with a local maximum or minimum. Near such a point, the function would not be injective because multiple points around the critical point could map to the same value. But wait, the function is injective, so it can't have any local extrema? Because in a local extremum, you have points around it with the same function value. But if f is injective, then each value is achieved exactly once, so there can't be any local maxima or minima. However, a function from R² to R might not have extrema if it's, say, strictly increasing in all directions, but that's difficult to achieve in two dimensions.\n\nAlternatively, consider the Borsuk-Ulam theorem, but that applies to maps from S^n to R^n, so maybe not directly here.\n\nWait, another approach: The image of R² under a continuous injective map would have to be an open interval in R, as connectedness is preserved. But R² is not homeomorphic to an open interval. However, the question is about a C¹ injective map. But even if it's differentiable, the image would still be an open interval, which is one-dimensional, and R² is two-dimensional. So such a map can't exist because of the difference in dimension, but this is more of a topological argument. However, the user is asking specifically for a C¹ map, not just continuous. Maybe the answer is that such a map doesn't exist, and the proof involves using the invariance of domain theorem, which states that a continuous injective map from R^n to R^m is only possible if m ≥ n. Since here m=1 < n=2, such a map can't exist. But does invariance of domain require the map to be continuous and injective, which would imply that the image is open in R^m, but since R^1 is lower dimension, this can't happen. Therefore, no such continuous injective map exists, let alone a C¹ one. Therefore, the answer is that there does not exist a C¹ injective map from R² to R.\n\nSo, putting this together, the problem is to determine whether such a map exists, and the answer is no. The assumptions would include that the map is C¹, injective, and from R² to R.",
