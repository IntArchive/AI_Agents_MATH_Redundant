    "Content": "How do I evaluate $$I_m = \\displaystyle \\int_0^{\\infty} \\text{sinc}^m(x) dx,$$ where $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$? For $m=1$ and $m=2$ , we have the well-known result that this equals $\\dfrac{\\pi}2$. In general, WolframAlpha suggests that is seems to be a rational multiple of $\\pi$. \\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c}\nm & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7\\\\\n\\hline\nI_m & \\dfrac{\\pi}2 & \\dfrac{\\pi}2 & \\dfrac{3\\pi}8 & \\dfrac{\\pi}3 & \\dfrac{115\\pi}{384} & \\dfrac{11\\pi}{40} & \\dfrac{5887 \\pi}{23040}\\\\\n\\end{array} $(1)$. Can we prove that $I_m$ is a rational multiple of $\\pi$ always? $(2)$. If so, is there a nice formula, i.e., if $I_m = \\dfrac{p(m)}{q(m)} \\pi$, where $p(m),q(m) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$, are there nice expressions for $p(m)$ and $q(m)$? P.S: This integral came up when I was trying my method to answer this question , by writing $\\dfrac{\\sin(x)}{x+\\sin(x)}$ as $$\\dfrac{\\sin(x)}{x+\\sin(x)} = \\text{sinc}(x) \\cdot \\dfrac1{1+\\text{sinc}(x)} = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (-1)^k \\text{sinc}^{k+1}(x)$$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Notice $\\lim_{x\\to 0} \\frac{\\sin x}{x}$ is bounded at $x = 0$, $$\\begin{align}\\int_0^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right)^m dx \n&= \\frac12 \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right)^m dx\\tag{*1}\\\\\n&= \\lim_{\\epsilon\\to 0} \\frac12 \\left(\\frac{1}{2i}\\right)^m \\oint_{C_{\\epsilon}} \\left(\\frac{e^{ix} - e^{-ix}}{x}\\right)^m dx\\tag{*2}\n\\end{align}$$\nWe can evaluate the integral $(*1)$ as a limit of a integral over a deformed\ncontour $C_{\\epsilon}$ which has a little half-circle of radius $\\epsilon$ at origin: $$C_{\\epsilon} = (-\\infty,-\\epsilon) \\cup \\left\\{ \\epsilon e^{i\\theta} : \\theta \\in [\\pi,2\\pi] \\right\\} \\cup ( +\\epsilon, +\\infty)$$ We then split the integrand in $(*2)$ in two pieces, those contains exponential factors $e^{ikx}$ for $k \\ge 0$ and those for $k < 0$. $$(*2) = \\lim_{\\epsilon\\to 0} \\frac12 \\left(\\frac{1}{2i}\\right)^m \\oint_{C_{\\epsilon}}  \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\lfloor\\frac{m}{2}\\rfloor} + \\sum_{k=\\lfloor\\frac{m}{2}\\rfloor+1} ^{m} \\right) \\binom{m}{k} \\frac{(-1)^k e^{i(m-2k)x}}{x^m} dx$$ To evaluate the $1^{st}$ piece, we need to complete the contour in upper half-plane. Since the completed contour contains the pole at $0$, we get: $$\\begin{align}\n\\sum_{k=0}^{\\lfloor\\frac{m}{2}\\rfloor} \\text{ in }(*2)\n&= \\frac12 \\left(\\frac{1}{2i}\\right)^m (2\\pi i)\\sum_{k=0}^{\\lfloor\\frac{m}{2}\\rfloor} \\binom{m}{k} \\frac{(-1)^k i^{m-1}(m-2k)^{m-1}}{(m-1)!}\\\\ &= \\frac{\\pi m}{2^m} \\sum_{k=0}^{\\lfloor\\frac{m}{2}\\rfloor} \\frac{(-1)^k (m-2k)^{m-1}}{k!(m-k)!}\\tag{*3}\\end{align}$$ To evaluate the $2^{nd}$ piece, we need to complete the contour in lower half-plane instead. Since the completed contour no longer contains any pole, it contributes nothing and hence $I_m$ is just equal to R.H.S of $(*3)$. Update About the question whether $I_m$ is decreasing. Aside from the exception $I_1 = I_2$, it is strictly decreasing. For $m \\ge 1$, it is clear $I_{2m} > I_{2m+1}$ because the difference of corresponding integrands is non-negative and not identically zero. For the remaining cases, we have: $$\\begin{align}&I_{2m+1}-I_{2m+2}\\\\ \n= & \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right)^{2m+1}\\left(1 - \\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right) dx\\\\\n= & \\left(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\int_{2n\\pi}^{(2n+1)\\pi}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right)^{2m+1}\\left[1 - \\frac{\\sin x}{x} - \\left(\\frac{x}{x+\\pi}\\right)^{2m+1}\\left(1 + \\frac{\\sin x}{x + \\pi}\\right)\\right] dx\n\\end{align}$$ Over the range $\\cup_{n=0}^{\\infty} (2n\\pi,(2n+1)\\pi)$, the factor $\\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right)^{2m+1}$ is positive. The other factor $\\Big[\\cdots\\Big]$ in above integral is bounded below by: $$\n\\begin{cases}\n1 - \\frac{\\sin x}{x} - \\left(\\frac{x}{x+\\pi}\\right)^3\\left(1 + \\frac{\\sin x}{x + \\pi}\\right), & \\text{ for } x \\in (0,\\pi)\\\\\n1 - \\frac{1}{x} - \\frac{x}{x+\\pi}\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{x}\\right)\n= \\frac{(\\pi - 2)x - \\pi}{x(x+\\pi)} & \\text{ for } x \\in \\cup_{n=1}^{\\infty}(2n\\pi,(2n+1)\\pi)\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nA simple plot will convince you both bounds are positive in corresponding range. This \nimplies the integrand in above integral is positive and hence $I_{2m+1} > I_{2m+2}$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem from Math Stack Exchange. The user is asking about evaluating the integral \\( I_m = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\text{sinc}^m(x) dx \\) where \\( m \\) is a positive integer. They also provided a table of values for \\( m \\) from 1 to 7, showing that each result is a rational multiple of \\( \\pi \\). The questions are whether this is always true and if there's a nice formula for the rational coefficients.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question and structure it according to the given format. The example given includes an assumption section where each line is a single condition on one object. The problem statement then follows.\n\nLooking at the original problem: the integral is from 0 to infinity, \\( m \\) is a positive integer. The user mentions that WolframAlpha suggests it's a rational multiple of \\( \\pi \\), and they want proof of this and possibly a formula for the coefficients.\n\nSo, the assumptions here would be:\n\n1. The integral is over the interval from 0 to infinity.\n2. \\( m \\) is a positive integer (since \\( m \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+ \\)).\n3. The function being integrated is \\( \\text{sinc}^m(x) \\), where \\( \\text{sinc}(x) = \\sin(x)/x \\).\n\nWait, does the problem mention anything else as assumptions? The original problem states the integral definition and the domain of \\( m \\). The user also references specific cases for \\( m =1,2 \\) etc., but those are examples, not assumptions. The problem is asking two specific questions: (1) whether \\( I_m \\) is a rational multiple of \\( \\pi \\), and (2) if there's a formula for \\( p(m) \\) and \\( q(m) \\).\n\nBut for the Assumption section, we need to list the given conditions. The problem defines \\( I_m \\) as that integral with \\( m \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+ \\). So the integral is from 0 to infinity, \\( m \\) is a positive integer, and the integrand is \\( \\text{sinc}^m(x) \\).\n\nBut in the example provided, the assumption listed was about \\( n \\) being an integer and divisible by 7. So in this case, the key assumptions are the integral's limits, the domain of \\( m \\), and the function being integrated. However, the problem itself is split into two parts: proving the rational multiple and finding a formula.\n\nWait, but the example's Assumption section included both the general condition (n is integer) and a specific one (divisible by 7). But in the original problem here, the user hasn't specified any additional constraints beyond \\( m \\) being a positive integer. So maybe the assumptions here are just that \\( m \\) is a positive integer and the integral is over 0 to infinity with the sinc function raised to the m-th power.\n\nSo, structuring the Assumption part:\n\nAssumption:\n- The integral is evaluated from 0 to infinity.\n- \\( m \\) is a positive integer.\n- The integrand is \\( \\text{sinc}^m(x) \\), where \\( \\text{sinc}(x) = \\frac{\\sin x}{x} \\).\n\nBut wait, in the example, each assumption is one line per object. So maybe each of these points is a separate line. Also, the problem mentions \"sinc^m(x)\", but it's important to define sinc(x) as sin(x)/x, which is part of the problem's setup. So that's an assumption as well.\n\nSo breaking down:\n\nAssumption:\n- \\( m \\) is a positive integer.\n- The integral is over the interval \\([0, \\infty)\\).\n- The function \\(\\text{sinc}(x)\\) is defined as \\(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\).\n- The integrand is \\(\\text{sinc}^m(x)\\).\n\nBut wait, maybe some of these can be combined. However, according to the example, each assumption should be a single line addressing one property or condition of one object. So \"m is a positive integer\" is one. The integral's domain is another. The definition of sinc(x) is another. The integrand being sinc^m(x) is perhaps redundant once sinc is defined, but maybe it's necessary to state.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to phrase it as:\n\nAssumption:\n- \\( m \\) is a positive integer.\n- The integral \\( I_m = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\text{sinc}^m(x) dx \\).\n- \\(\\text{sinc}(x) = \\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\).\n\nBut perhaps the integral's structure is part of the problem statement, so maybe in the problem part. Wait, the example's problem part included the definition of A(n), so maybe here the problem statement would include the definition of I_m.\n\nLooking back at the example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) - 6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem:\nProve that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, in the example, the problem statement includes the definition of A(n). So in this case, the problem part would be to evaluate the integral I_m as defined, and answer the two questions.\n\nBut the original question here is asking two parts: (1) prove that I_m is a rational multiple of π, and (2) find a formula for p(m)/q(m). So the problem part should include both questions.\n\nSo the Assumptions are the conditions given, which are:\n\n- m is a positive integer.\n- The integral is from 0 to infinity.\n- The integrand is sinc^m(x), where sinc(x) = sin(x)/x.\n\nTherefore, structuring:\n\nAssumption:\n- \\( m \\) is a positive integer.\n- The integral \\( I_m \\) is evaluated over the interval \\( [0, \\infty) \\).\n- The function \\( \\text{sinc}(x) \\) is defined as \\( \\frac{\\sin x}{x} \\).\n\nProblem:\nProve that \\( I_m = \\displaystyle \\int_0^{\\infty} \\text{sinc}^m(x) dx \\) is a rational multiple of \\( \\pi \\). If so, find a formula for the rational coefficient \\( \\frac{p(m)}{q(m)} \\) where \\( p(m), q(m) \\) are positive integers.\n\nBut the original problem's questions are two parts: (1) Can we prove that \\( I_m \\) is a rational multiple of \\( \\pi \\) always? (2) If so, is there a nice formula for \\( p(m) \\) and \\( q(m) \\)?\n\nSo the problem should be phrased as:\n\nProblem:\n(1) Can we prove that \\( I_m \\) is always a rational multiple of \\( \\pi \\)? \n(2) If yes, is there a nice formula for \\( I_m = \\frac{p(m)}{q(m)} \\pi \\), where \\( p(m) \\) and \\( q(m) \\) are positive integers?\n\nBut the example's problem section just had a single statement. However, the original question here has two parts. So how to structure it? The user might want both parts addressed. So in the problem section, include both questions.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n- \\( m \\) is a positive integer.\n- The integral \\( I_m \\) is evaluated from \\( 0 \\) to \\( \\infty \\).\n- \\( \\text{sinc}(x) = \\frac{\\sin x}{x} \\).\n\nProblem:\nProve that \\( I_m = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\text{sinc}^m(x) dx \\) is a rational multiple of \\( \\pi \\). Additionally, if true, find a formula for the coefficients \\( p(m) \\) and \\( q(m) \\) such that \\( I_m = \\frac{p(m)}{q(m)} \\pi \\).\n\nAlternatively, keeping the two explicit questions as per the original:\n\nProblem:\n(1) Prove that \\( I_m = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\text{sinc}^m(x) dx \\) is always a rational multiple of \\( \\pi \\) for \\( m \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+ \\). \n(2) If (1) is true, find expressions for positive integers \\( p(m) \\) and \\( q(m) \\) such that \\( I_m = \\frac{p(m)}{q(m)} \\pi \\).\n\nBut the example didn't use numbering in the problem statement. So maybe combine both parts into a single problem statement. The original problem lists two questions as (1) and (2), but in the formatted problem, we might need to present them as a single problem with two parts. However, the example's problem section was a single statement. So perhaps structure it as:\n\nProblem:\nProve that \\( I_m = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\text{sinc}^m(x) dx \\) is a rational multiple of \\( \\pi \\) for all positive integers \\( m \\), and determine if there exists a nice formula for the coefficients \\( p(m) \\) and \\( q(m) \\) such that \\( I_m = \\frac{p(m)}{q(m)} \\pi \\).\n\nAlternatively, the exact wording from the user's question: \n\nOriginal problem's questions:\n\"Can we prove that \\(I_m\\) is a rational multiple of \\(\\pi\\) always? If so, is there a nice formula, i.e., if \\(I_m = \\dfrac{p(m)}{q(m)} \\pi\\), where \\(p(m),q(m) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+\\), are there nice expressions for \\(p(m)\\) and \\(q(m)\\)?\"\n\nTherefore, the problem part should include both questions. To replicate the original intent, it's better to present both parts as (1) and (2). But according to the example, the problem is a single statement. However, the example had only one problem to prove. In this case, there are two explicit questions. Therefore, perhaps the problem should be presented as:\n\nProblem:\n(1) Prove that \\( I_m \\) is a rational multiple of \\( \\pi \\) for all positive integers \\( m \\).\n(2) If (1) holds, find expressions for \\( p(m) \\) and \\( q(m) \\) in \\( I_m = \\frac{p(m)}{q(m)} \\pi \\), where \\( p(m), q(m) \\) are positive integers.\n\nBut the example format didn't use sub-questions. Maybe the problem can be written as two sentences. Let me check the original user's problem statement:\n\nOriginal problem's questions:\n\"Can we prove that \\(I_m\\) is a rational multiple of \\(\\pi\\) always? $(2)$. If so, is there a nice formula...\"\n\nSo the user explicitly lists them as two parts. Therefore, to maintain fidelity, the problem section should include both questions. But the example format didn't use numbering. Maybe combine them into a single problem statement with both questions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considered as two separate questions, but according to the user's instruction, the format should be:\n\nProblem: <The problem>\n\nSo maybe present it as:\n\nProblem:\nProve that \\( I_m = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\text{sinc}^m(x) dx \\) is a rational multiple of \\( \\pi \\) for all positive integers \\( m \\). Additionally, if this is true, determine whether there exists a nice formula for the coefficients \\( p(m) \\) and \\( q(m) \\) such that \\( I_m = \\frac{p(m)}{q(m)} \\pi \\).\n\nBut the user's original problem had two explicit questions, so perhaps better to include both as (1) and (2). However, the example didn't use numbering. Maybe the way to handle it is to write both as part of the problem statement.\n\nNow, verifying assumptions:\n\nOriginal problem states: \"Evaluating \\(\\int_0^{\\infty} \\text{sinc}^m(x) dx\\)\" with \\( m \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+ \\). So the integral's limits and the domain of \\( m \\) are given. The definition of sinc(x) as sin(x)/x is also part of the problem's setup.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should capture these:\n\n- \\( m \\) is a positive integer.\n- The integral is from 0 to infinity.\n- \\( \\text{sinc}(x) = \\frac{\\sin x}{x} \\).\n\nEach of these is a separate line in the assumption section.\n\nSo, final formatting:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n- $m$ is a positive integer.\n- The integral $I_m$ is evaluated from $0$ to $\\infty$.\n- $\\text{sinc}(x)$ is defined as $\\frac{\\sin x}{x}$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $I_m = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\text{sinc}^m(x) dx$ is a rational multiple of $\\pi$ for all positive integers $m$.
