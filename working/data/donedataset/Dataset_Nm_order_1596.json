    "Content": "Check my proof please. Let $\\Bbb Z_p:=\\Bbb Z/p\\Bbb Z$ be the quotient ring modulo $p$ . I want to prove that if $p$ is prime then $\\Bbb Z_p$ is a field. Known facts about the quotient rings of the kind $\\Bbb Z_n$ (I dont list all the characteristics of a ring, just some ones): They are commutative rings with unity. $[0]=[n]$ is the identity of addition or zero. Then $[n]+[a]=[a]$ and $[n]\\cdot[a]=[n]$ for all $[a]\\in\\Bbb Z_n$ . $[1]$ is the multiplicative identity or unity. Then $[1]\\cdot[a]=[a]$ for all $[a]\\in\\Bbb Z_n$ . The addition is defined as $[a]+[b]=[a+b]$ , and the multiplication is defined as $[a]\\cdot[b]=[ab]$ . $[a]=[b]$ means that exists $z\\in\\Bbb Z$ such that $a=b+nz$ . $|\\Bbb Z_p|=p$ . A ring $\\Bbb Z_p$ dont have zero divisors , i.e. doesnt exist $[a],[b]\\in\\Bbb Z_p$ distinct of $[p]$ such that $[a]\\cdot[b]=[p]$ . Proof by contradiction: suppose that exists such $[a],[b]$ distinct of $[p]$ that are zero divisors. Then exist some $z_j\\in\\Bbb Z$ such that: $$(a+pz_1)(b+pz_2)=pz_3\\iff ab+pz_4=pz_3\\iff ab=pz_5$$ but this is a contradiction with the assumption that $a,b\\neq p$ and $p$ prime, so dont exist divisors of zero on any $\\Bbb Z_p$ . $\\Box$ For any $[a]\\in\\Bbb Z_p$ distinct of $[p]$ exist $[b]$ such that $[a][b]=[1]$ . Because $\\Bbb Z_p$ dont have zero divisors and is finite for some $[a]\\neq[p]$ we have that if $[b]\\neq[c]$ then $[a][b]\\neq[a][c]$ . Proof by contradiction: if $[a][b]=[a][c]$ in the above conditions then $$[a][c]=[ac]=[ab]=[a][b]\\iff ac+pz_1=ab+pz_2\\iff a(c-b)=pz_3$$ for some $z_j\\in\\Bbb Z$ . But $pz_3\\in[p]$ , then $[a][c-b]=[p]$ but because there are no zero divisors in $\\Bbb Z_p$ then or $[a]=[p]$ or $[c-b]=[p]$ what contradicts the above conditions. $\\Box$ Because $[a][b]\\neq[a][c]$ for $[a]\\neq[p]$ and $[b]\\neq[c]$ then for any $[a]\\neq[p]$ we have that $$[a]\\cdot\\Bbb Z_p=\\Bbb Z_p\\implies \\exists [b]\\in\\Bbb Z_p:[a][b]=[1]$$ In other words: every element of $\\Bbb Z_p$ but $[p]$ have a multiplicative inverse as stated above. $\\Box$ Because $\\Bbb Z_p$ is a commutative ring with $[1]\\neq[0]$ and have multiplicative inverse for all their elements but $[p]=[0]$ then $\\Bbb Z_p$ is a field. $\\Box$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I have looked over your proof. Good job, it is correct.\nComments: In the proof that inverses exist, you implicitly used the following fact: if $[c-b]=[p]$, then $[b] = [c]$. This is easy to prove, but you could add a sentence of explanation. Some of the time, when you introduced $z_j$ in your reasoning, it was unnecessary. For example, if $[ab] = [ac]$, then $[a][b] = [a][c]$, so $[a]([b] - [c]) = [0]$, so either $[a] = [0]$ or $[b] = [c]$. No use of $z_j$ necessary. Anyway, such reasoning is often more commonly written out using the \"mod\" notation.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants to show that if p is prime, then the ring Z_p (which is Z/pZ) is a field. They provided a proof, and I need to check it. Let me start by recalling the definitions.\n\nFirst, a field is a commutative ring with unity where every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. So, to prove Z_p is a field, we need to verify three things: it's a commutative ring with unity (which the user mentions is already established), that 1 ≠ 0 in the ring (which is true because if p is prime, then p ≥ 2, so [1] ≠ [0] since 1 and 0 are different modulo p), and that every non-zero element has an inverse.\n\nThe user's proof starts by noting that Z_p is a commutative ring with unity. Then they argue that there are no zero divisors in Z_p when p is prime. Their reasoning is by contradiction: assuming there exist non-zero elements [a] and [b] such that [a][b] = [0]. Translating this, ab ≡ 0 mod p, so p divides ab. Since p is prime, this implies p divides a or p divides b. But in Z_p, if p divides a, then [a] = [0], which contradicts [a] being non-zero. Similarly for [b]. Hence, no zero divisors.\n\nNext, they want to show every non-zero element has an inverse. They use the fact that Z_p is finite and has no zero divisors. They argue that for a non-zero [a], the multiplication map by [a] is injective. Suppose [a][b] = [a][c]. Then [a][b - c] = [0]. Since there are no zero divisors and [a] ≠ [0], it must be that [b - c] = [0], so [b] = [c]. Hence, the map is injective. Since the ring is finite, an injective map from the ring to itself is also surjective. Therefore, there exists some [b] where [a][b] = [1], proving [a] has an inverse.\n\nPutting it all together: commutative ring with unity, no zero divisors, every non-zero has an inverse. Therefore, Z_p is a field.\n\nWait, but the user's initial problem statement didn't specify that p is prime in the assumptions. Let me check the original question again. The problem is to show that if p is prime, then Z_p is a field. The user's proof correctly uses that p is prime to conclude no zero divisors. But in their formatted problem example, they included an assumption that n is divisible by 7. In the problem here, the key assumption is that p is prime. So, the assumptions should list that p is prime, Z_p is the quotient ring Z/pZ, etc. Let me structure that.\n\nBut wait, the user's own example structured the problem with assumptions and the problem statement. So in this case, the original problem is \"Show that if p is prime then Z_p is a field.\" The user's proof uses that p is prime to establish no zero divisors and then uses properties of finite rings without zero divisors to get inverses. So, the key assumption is that p is prime. The problem statement should then be \"Prove that if p is prime, then Z_p is a field.\" But in the assumptions, we need to list all the necessary conditions applied to each object. For example, p is prime, Z_p is the quotient ring Z/pZ, etc.\n\nWait, in the example given, the user had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. But in the problem here, the only assumption is that p is prime. The rest are definitions of Z_p. But according to the user's example, they included in the assumptions things like \"n is an integer\", \"n is divisible by 7\". So perhaps here, the assumptions would be: p is a prime, Z_p is the quotient ring Z/pZ, etc. But maybe in the problem statement, the key assumption is that p is prime. The rest are definitions. So maybe the problem is structured as:\n\nAssumption:\np is a prime number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that Z_p is a field.\n\nBut perhaps the user includes more. Wait, looking at the example, the user included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. So each assumption is a condition on one object. Here, the main assumption is p is prime. The other properties (like Z_p is a quotient ring) are definitions, not assumptions. So the formatted problem would have the assumption that p is prime, and the problem is to prove Z_p is a field.\n\nThe user's own formatted example had:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumptions:\nn is an integer,\nn is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem:\nProve that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7. The user added that as an assumption. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in their example. Wait, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The user formatted it as:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem:\nProve that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut that seems incorrect because the original problem's assumption was for every integer n, not just those divisible by 7. However, in their formatted problem, they added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Wait, perhaps the user's example is incorrect. Maybe the original problem had some hidden assumption, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the user made an error in their example. For instance, maybe the original problem had n not being restricted, but in their formatted problem, they added an assumption. But that would change the problem. So perhaps the example is not correctly formatted. However, since the user provided that example as a guideline, we need to follow it even if it's possibly incorrect.\n\nIn the current problem, the original problem is to show that if p is prime, then Z_p is a field. Therefore, following the example's structure, the assumption should list the conditions given in the problem. In the original problem, the condition is that p is prime. So the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\np is a prime number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that Z_p is a field.\n\nBut in the example, the user added an assumption (n divisible by 7) which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, the original example's original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems contradictory. Unless the user intended to modify the problem. For instance, perhaps the original problem had a mistake, and the correct assumption is that n is divisible by 7. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to prove divisibility by 91 under the assumption that n is divisible by 7. But the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the formatted problem in the example is incorrect. However, since the user provided that example, we have to follow their format, even if it's flawed.\n\nTherefore, in the current problem, even though the original problem states \"if p is prime then Z_p is a field\", the formatted problem should list the assumptions as given. The only assumption here is that p is prime. The rest are definitions or known properties. So:\n\nAssumption:\np is a prime number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that Z_p is a field.\n\nBut let me check the user's original problem again. The user's original question on Math Stack Exchange is titled \"Show that if p is prime then Z_p is a field\". The user's own proof uses the fact that p is prime to avoid zero divisors. So the key assumption is that p is prime. Therefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\np is a prime number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that Z_p is a field.\n\nBut maybe the user includes more assumptions, like Z_p is a commutative ring with unity, etc., but according to the example, the assumptions are the given conditions. In the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like they might have misformatted. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem had a different context. Maybe the problem actually required n divisible by 7, but was stated as \"for every integer n\", and the user corrected it. But without the original context, it's hard to say. Assuming the user's example is correct as per their own structure, then in this case, the assumptions should list all the given conditions in the problem. The problem says \"if p is prime\", so the assumption is p is prime. Therefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\np is a prime number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that Z_p is a field.\n\nI think that's correct. The rest of the elements in the problem (like Z_p being a quotient ring, etc.) are definitions, not assumptions. The key assumption given in the problem is that p is prime. Therefore, the answer should follow this structure.",
