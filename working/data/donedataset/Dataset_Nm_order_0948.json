    "Content": "Let $f(|x|)$ be a integrable radial function in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ ($|\\cdot|$ denotes the euclidean norm as in convention). The following identity is used to simplify computations $$\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n}f(|x|)\\mathrm{d}x = \\omega_{n-1}\\int_0^\\infty f(r) r^{n-1} \\mathrm{d}r,$$\nwhere $\\omega_{n-1}$ denotes the surface area of the $(n-1)$-sphere of radius 1. But I have never found any full proofs on such topic. Does anyone have some references in mind, better some source which I can actually refer to? updates Recently I found this subject has been mentioned by Stein in the appendix from his book \"Fourier Analysis\", and it further refers to Buck's \"Advanced Calculus\", Folland's \"Advanced Calculus\" and Lang's \"Undergraduate Analysis\". \nI have gone through the later two. It seems to me that Lang's treatment is pretty self-contained, though it is given in exercise hence details omitted. Mentioned by TCL, Evan's book on measure theory is decent but I'm not sure if it's too heavy. It let me feel like shooting mosquito with bazooka.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Spherical coordinates in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is treated fully in Karl Stromberg's book \"Introduction to Classical Real Analysis\" p. 369-370. Note that on p. 370, it shows the Jacobian of the coordinate transformation as $$r^{n-1} \\prod_{j=1}^{n-2} (\\sin\\theta_j)^{n-j-1}$$ So if your function is radial, then \\begin{align*}\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n}f(|x|)\\mathrm{d}x &=\\int_{-\\pi}^\\pi\\int_0^\\pi\\int_0^\\pi\\cdots\\int_0^\\infty f(r)r^{n-1}\\prod_{j=1}^{n-2} (\\sin\\theta_j)^{n-j-1}\\,dr \\, d\\theta_1\\cdots d\\theta_{n-2}\\,d\\theta_{n-1}\\\\&= \\omega_{n-1}\\int_0^\\infty f(r) r^{n-1} \\mathrm{d}r,\\end{align*} where $$\\omega_{n-1}=\\int_{-\\pi}^\\pi\\int_0^\\pi\\int_0^\\pi\\cdots\\int_0^\\pi \\prod_{j=1}^{n-2} (\\sin\\theta_j)^{n-j-1}\\,d\\theta_1\\cdots d\\theta_{n-2}\\,d\\theta_{n-1}$$ Stromberg, Karl Robert , An introduction to classical real analysis, Providence, RI: AMS Chelsea Publishing (ISBN 978-1-4704-2544-9/hbk). xiv, 577 p.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this Math Stack Exchange question. The user is asking about the integration of radial functions in ℝⁿ. The main problem they mention is the identity that converts the integral over ℝⁿ into a one-dimensional integral involving the surface area of the (n-1)-sphere. They want references for a full proof of this identity.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The function is radial, so it depends only on the Euclidean norm |x|. The function f(|x|) is integrable in ℝⁿ. The identity involves the surface area ω_{n-1}, which is the surface area of the unit (n-1)-sphere. The integral over ℝⁿ is transformed into an integral from 0 to ∞ with r^{n-1} dr.\n\nThe original problem statement mentions that the user hasn't found full proofs and is looking for references. But when structuring the problem according to the given format, the \"Assumption\" part should list each condition or property applied to one object. The \"Problem\" part is to state what needs to be proven or found.\n\nSo, the assumptions here are: f is a radial function (depends only on |x|), f is integrable over ℝⁿ, and the integral is expressed using the surface area ω_{n-1}. Each of these is a separate assumption. Then the problem is to prove that integral identity.\n\nWait, but the user isn't exactly asking to prove it themselves, but to provide references. However, in the example given, the problem was structured as \"Prove that...\". But in this case, the user is asking for references. But maybe the core problem is still the proof of the integral identity. The references are part of the solution, but the problem itself is about establishing that identity. So perhaps the problem part is to prove the identity, and the user is seeking references for that proof.\n\nTherefore, structuring the problem as per the example, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. f is a radial function in ℝⁿ (i.e., f(|x|)).\n2. f is integrable over ℝⁿ.\n3. The integral is transformed using the surface area ω_{n-1}.\n\nBut wait, the third point is part of the identity to be proven, not an assumption. The assumptions should be the given conditions. So the function is radial and integrable. The problem is to prove the integral equals ω_{n-1} times the integral from 0 to ∞ of f(r)r^{n-1} dr.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- f is a radial function defined on ℝⁿ (i.e., f depends only on |x|).\n- f is integrable over ℝⁿ.\n\nThe problem is to prove the integral identity involving ω_{n-1} and the radial integral.\n\nI need to check the original question again. The user wrote: \"Let f(|x|) be a integrable radial function in ℝⁿ... The following identity is used to simplify computations [integral equals ω...]. But I have never found any full proofs on such topic. Does anyone have some references...\"\n\nSo the core problem they present is the proof of the integral identity. The request for references is part of their question, but the structured problem format seems to focus on the mathematical problem itself, not the request for references. However, the example given in the original instruction includes \"Prove that...\" as the problem part, even though the original question was about divisibility. So following that, the problem here should be to prove the integral identity, and the assumptions are the conditions given (f is radial, integrable). The mention of references is part of the user's quest for help but isn't part of the structured problem format. So the formatted problem should list the assumptions and the problem to prove the identity.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n- f is a radial function in ℝⁿ (i.e., f depends only on |x|),\n- f is integrable over ℝⁿ.\n\nProblem:\nProve that\n∫_{ℝⁿ} f(|x|) dx = ω_{n-1} ∫₀^∞ f(r) r^{n−1} dr,\nwhere ω_{n−1} is the surface area of the unit (n−1)-sphere.\n\nYes, that seems right. The user's mention of references is part of their request but not part of the problem statement to be formatted. The structured format is about the mathematical problem itself. The example given had the problem as \"Prove that...\", so following that, the problem here is to prove the integral identity. The assumptions are the conditions on f (radial and integrable).",
