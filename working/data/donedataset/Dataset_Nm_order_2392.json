    "Content": "$A$ is a $n\\times n$ matrix such that $ A^m = 0 $ for some positive integer $m$ .\n  Show that $A^n = 0$ . My attempt: For $n > m$ , it's obvious since matrix multiplication is associative. For $n < m$ , $A^n\\times A^{m-n} = 0$ ; not sure what to do next.\nAlso I know that $\\det A = 0$ .",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If $A^m=0$, then the minimal polynomial of $A$ divides $x^m$.  The minimal polynomial has degree at most $n$ by Cayley-Hamilton. Here is an alternative approach that doesn't rely on knowing anything about minimal polynomials, or Cayley-Hamilton. Consider $A$ as a linear transformation on $K^n$ if $K$ is your base field.  Let $M_1$ be the range of $A$, i.e., $M_1=A(K^n)=\\{Av:v\\in K^n\\}$.  For $j>1$ let $M_{j}=A(M_{j-1})$ be the image of $M_{j-1}$ under $A$.  In other words, $M_j=A^j(K^n)$, and we can include $M_0=K^n$ for convenience.  Note that each $M_j$ is a subspace and $M_j\\subseteq M_{j-1}$ for all $j$. We know that $A^m=0$, so $M_m=\\{0\\}$.  If for some $j$, $M_j=M_{j-1}$, then $M_{j+1}=AM_{j}=AM_{j-1}=M_j$, so $M_{j-1}=M_j=M_{j+1}=M_{j+2}=\\cdots$.  It follows that $M_j$ must be $\\{0\\}$ in such cases.  This implies that all of the containments are proper until you get to $\\{0\\}$, so there is an $m_0$ such that $\\{0\\}=M_{m_0}\\subsetneq M_{m_0-1}\\subsetneq\\cdots\\subsetneq M_2\\subsetneq M_1\\subsetneq K^n$.  Since there are $m_0$ proper containments of subspaces and $K^n$ is $n$ dimensional, this implies that $m_0\\leq n$.  Since $M_{m_0}=\\{0\\}$ and $M_{m_0}$ is the range of $A^{m_0}$, it follows that $A^{m_0}=0$, and finally $A^n=A^{m_0}A^{n-m_0}=0$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual mathematics professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question according to the specified structure. Let me first understand the original problem and the example provided.\n\nThe original problem is about proving that a nilpotent matrix A of size n×n satisfies A^n = 0. The user's question mentions that A^m = 0 for some positive integer m, and they need to show A^n = 0. They also mention their attempt for cases when n > m and n < m, and note that the determinant of A is zero.\n\nLooking at the example given, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object. In the example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Then the problem statement is restated concisely.\n\nSo, for the current problem, I need to extract the assumptions from the original question. Let's parse the original question:\n\n- A is a n×n matrix (so it's a square matrix of size n)\n- A^m = 0 for some positive integer m (A is nilpotent with index m)\n- Need to show A^n = 0\n\nThe user's attempt mentions considering cases when n > m and n < m. However, the key properties here are the size of the matrix (n×n) and the existence of some m such that A^m = 0. The determinant being zero is a consequence of A being nilpotent, but maybe not a necessary assumption here since it's derived from the nilpotency.\n\nSo the assumptions should be:\n\n1. A is an n×n matrix.\n2. There exists a positive integer m such that A^m = 0.\n\nThe problem is to show that A^n = 0.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included that n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem statement, the user had \"for every integer n\". However, in the formatted problem, they added the assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe there was a confusion in the example? Let me check.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem lists assumptions as n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, but that seems contradictory because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be an error in the example. However, perhaps the user made a mistake, but for the current problem, we have to follow the instruction to filter unrelated information and list the assumptions properly.\n\nIn the current problem, the key assumptions are that A is an n×n nilpotent matrix (i.e., A^m = 0 for some m). The problem is to show A^n = 0. The user's mention of determinant is their own knowledge, but it's not part of the problem's given conditions. So the determinant part is unrelated information and should be filtered out.\n\nThus, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n- A is an n×n matrix.\n- There exists a positive integer m such that A^m = 0.\n\nProblem:\nShow that A^n = 0.\n\nWait, but the original problem's title says \"nth power of a n×n nilpotent matrix equals zero\", so maybe m is not fixed. The problem states \"for some positive integer m\", so m is any such that A^m=0. The minimal such m is called the index of nilpotency, and the theorem is that for an n×n matrix, the index of nilpotency is at most n, hence A^n =0.\n\nTherefore, the problem's assumptions are exactly those two points. The user's mention of determinant is their own knowledge but not part of the problem's given conditions. The attempt's discussion about n > m and n < m is part of their thinking process but not part of the problem statement.\n\nSo, finalizing the formatted problem as:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nA is an n×n matrix,\nThere exists a positive integer m such that A^m = 0.\nProblem:\nShow that $A^n = 0$.\n###",
