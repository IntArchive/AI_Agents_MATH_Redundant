    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here I leave the outline. Down below you have the full solution. $(1)$ Note that $$x^{-x}=e^{-x\\log x }$$ $(2)$ $$e^u=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\frac{ u^n}{n!}$$ Use this with $u=-x\\log x$ $(3)$ Since the power series converges uniformly over $[0,1]$ ; we may integrate termwise. $(4)$ You'll need to evaluate $$\\vartheta(n)=\\int_0^1(-\\log x)^n \\frac{x^n}{n!}dx$$ $(5)$ Make the change of variable $-\\log x\\mapsto u$ and then $(n+1)u\\mapsto v$ $(6)$ You should find that $$ \\vartheta(n)= \\frac{1}{{{{\\left( {n + 1} \\right)}^{n + 1}}}}$$ You'll need the fact that $$\\Gamma(n+1)=\\int_0^\\infty  {{v^n}{e^{ - v}}} dv=n!$$ Note that $$x^{-x}=e^{-x\\log x }$$ Thus, you're interested in $$\\int_0^1 e^{-x\\log x } dx$$ Now, for every $x\\in \\Bbb R$ , it is valid that $$e^x=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\frac{ x^n}{n!}$$ Particularly $$e^{-x \\log x}=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\frac{ (-x\\log x)^n}{n!}$$ This is $$e^{-x \\log x}=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty (-\\log x)^n \\frac{x^n}{n!}$$ Since the power series converges uniformly over $[0,1]$ ; we may integrate termwise, to get so we're interested in $$\\vartheta(n)=\\int_0^1(-\\log x)^n \\frac{x^n}{n!}dx$$ Make a change of variable $-\\log x\\mapsto u$ , to get $$\\vartheta(n)=\\frac{1}{{n!}}\\int_0^\\infty  {{u^n}{e^{ - \\left( {n + 1} \\right)u}}} du$$ Once again, $(n+1)u\\mapsto v$ , so $$\\begin{align}\n  \\vartheta(n)&=\\frac{1}{{n!}}\\int_0^\\infty  {\\frac{{{v^n}}}{{{{\\left( {n + 1} \\right)}^n}}}{e^{ - v}}} \\frac{{dv}}{{n + 1}}\\\\ &= \\frac{1}{{n!}}\\frac{1}{{{{\\left( {n + 1} \\right)}^{n + 1}}}}\\int_0^\\infty  {{v^n}{e^{ - v}}} dv ^{\\color{red}{(1)}} \\cr \n    \\\\&= \\frac{1}{{n!}}\\frac{1}{{{{\\left( {n + 1} \\right)}^{n + 1}}}}n!  \\cr \n    \\\\&= \\frac{1}{{{{\\left( {n + 1} \\right)}^{n + 1}}}} \\end{align} $$ Thus, you get $$\\int_0^1 {{x^{ - x}}} dx = \\sum\\limits_{n = 0}^\\infty  {\\frac{1}{{{{\\left( {n + 1} \\right)}^{n + 1}}}}}  = \\sum\\limits_{n = 1}^\\infty  {\\frac{1}{{{n^n}}}} $$ as desired. $\\color{red}{(1)}$ This is the famous $\\Gamma$ function. For natural $n$ , we have $$\\int_0^\\infty  {{v^n}{e^{ - v}}} dv=n!$$ This can be proven by induction and integration by parts.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's start by looking at the problem the user provided. They want me to format the Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. The original question is about proving that the integral of x^(-x) from 0 to 1 equals the sum from n=1 to infinity of n^(-n). \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The example given in the problem shows that assumptions are specific conditions or properties applied to one object each. In the example, they listed that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. \n\nLooking at the current problem, the user mentions they need to prove the equality between the integral and the series. The question mentions using a convergence theorem but doesn't specify any particular conditions. However, when dealing with integrals and infinite series, there are implicit assumptions. For instance, the function x^(-x) must be integrable over [0,1], and the series must converge. Additionally, the problem might involve expanding x^(-x) as a power series and then interchanging the integral and summation, which requires uniform convergence or dominated convergence.\n\nSo the assumptions here would include that x is in the interval [0,1], the function x^(-x) is integrable on that interval, the series sum_{n=1}^∞ n^{-n} converges, and perhaps that the interchange of integral and summation is valid (maybe by uniform convergence or dominated convergence theorem). However, the problem statement doesn't explicitly state these, so I need to infer based on standard mathematical practice.\n\nWait, but the example given in the original problem didn't include implicit assumptions like integrability or convergence. The example's assumptions were explicitly stated in the original problem (n is an integer, divisible by 7). However, in this case, the original problem doesn't mention any such conditions. The user might have filtered out some information, but the question as stated just asks to prove the equality. So perhaps there are no explicit assumptions given, but in the formatted problem, should I list implicit ones? The example didn't do that. Let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted assumptions were \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". However, in the original problem, it's \"for every integer n\", which would mean that n is any integer, but the conclusion is that it's divisible by 91. But 91 is 7*13. The example's formatted problem has an assumption that \"n is divisible by 7\", which might not be in the original. Wait, there's a discrepancy here. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1 ) -6^n (3^n + 2^n ) is divisible by 91.\" Formatted assumption lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", which doesn't restrict n to be divisible by 7. So the example might have an error. However, the user provided that as their example. Therefore, perhaps the user is expecting that in the problem formatting, assumptions are to be listed even if they are not explicitly stated but necessary for the problem. But in the example, the user included an assumption \"n is divisible by 7\" which wasn't in the original problem. That suggests that perhaps the user made a mistake, or perhaps the original problem had a typo. But regardless, following the user's example, they want assumptions listed, even if they are part of the problem's hidden conditions.\n\nWait, maybe the original example problem was mistyped. Let me think again. If the original problem was to prove that for every integer n divisible by 7, A(n) is divisible by 91. Then the assumptions would make sense. But the user wrote the original problem as \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. So perhaps the user's example has a mistake. Therefore, maybe in the current problem, even if the original question doesn't state assumptions explicitly, we need to infer them based on standard mathematical requirements.\n\nBut the problem here is to structure the given problem into assumptions and problem. The example might have been an error, but following the user's example, perhaps they expect that assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. Wait, in the example, the problem states \"for every integer n\", which is an assumption. But the formatted problem also added \"n is divisible by 7\" which wasn't in the original. That seems contradictory.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in their example. Let me check the example again:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1 ) -6^n (3^n + 2^n ) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn is divisible by 7.\nProblem:\nProve that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like an error. Because if the original problem is for every integer n, then the assumption should just be \"n is an integer\". But the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", which would actually restrict the problem. Unless there was a typo in the original problem. For instance, maybe the original problem was supposed to say \"for every integer n divisible by 7\", but the user mistyped it. Otherwise, the example's formatted problem is incorrect.\n\nAssuming that the user's example is correct, then perhaps they intended that even if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the actual problem's conclusion requires n to be divisible by 7. So maybe the example had a typo. Alternatively, maybe the example is correct, and the user is showing that even if the problem states \"for every integer n\", but the correct assumptions are that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But that would mean the problem is misstated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the example is part of a different problem. Hmm. This is confusing. But given that the user provided that example, perhaps in their formatting, they want to extract all conditions that are necessary for the problem, even if they are not explicitly stated. For instance, in the example, the problem's conclusion (divisible by 91) requires that 91 divides the expression. 91 factors into 7 and 13. So perhaps the original problem had a hidden condition that n is divisible by 7, but the user's example erroneously included it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's example is wrong, but regardless, we need to follow their structure. So, for the current problem, the Math Stack Exchange question is: Prove that ∫₀¹ x⁻ˣ dx = Σₙ=₁^∞ n⁻ⁿ. The user mentions they need to use a convergence theorem but are stuck. \n\nSo, what are the assumptions here? The integral is from 0 to 1 of x^(-x) dx. The series is sum_{n=1}^\\infty n^{-n}. The problem is to show their equality. \n\nPossible assumptions could be:\n\n- x is a real number in the interval [0,1].\n- The function x^(-x) is integrable on [0,1].\n- The series sum_{n=1}^\\infty n^{-n} converges.\n- The interchange of integral and summation is valid (which could rely on uniform convergence or the dominated convergence theorem).\n\nBut the question doesn't state these explicitly. However, in the example, the user included assumptions that weren't explicit. So perhaps we need to list implicit assumptions necessary for the proof.\n\nAlternatively, if the original problem doesn't state any assumptions, then maybe the Assumption section is empty. But the example shows that even if the problem says \"for every integer n\", the assumption is listed as \"n is an integer\". So in this case, the problem is to prove the equality, which holds for the integral and the sum. The integral is over [0,1], so x is in [0,1]. The function x^(-x) is defined on (0,1], but at x=0, x^(-x) approaches 1 as x approaches 0 from the right (since 0^0 is 1 in the limit). So the function is continuous on (0,1] and has a limit at 0, making it integrable. \n\nTherefore, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- x is in the interval [0,1].\n- The function x^(-x) is integrable on [0,1].\n- The series ∑_{n=1}^∞ n^{-n} converges.\n- The interchange of summation and integral is valid.\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't mention these. However, following the example, where the user extracted the assumption that n is an integer (from \"for every integer n\"), maybe here we need to list the domain of x and perhaps the convergence conditions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has no explicit assumptions beyond what is stated, so the Assumption section would be empty. But in the example, even though the original problem didn't state \"n is divisible by 7\", the formatted problem included it. That suggests that perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user wants us to follow their structure. Given this confusion, but trying to adhere to the example, perhaps we need to extract explicit conditions from the problem. \n\nThe problem is to prove ∫₀¹ x⁻ˣ dx = Σₙ=₁^∞ n⁻ⁿ. The integral is over [0,1], so x is in [0,1]. The function x⁻ˣ is defined as e^{-x ln x}, which is continuous on (0,1] and has a removable singularity at x=0. Thus, the integral is proper. The series Σ n⁻ⁿ is convergent since n⁻ⁿ decreases exponentially. \n\nBut the problem doesn't state any assumptions explicitly. However, to apply the convergence theorem (like dominated convergence or monotone convergence), certain conditions must be met. For example, expanding x⁻ˣ as a power series and then integrating term by term requires uniform convergence or dominated convergence. \n\nBut since the example included assumptions that were part of the problem statement, even if implicit, perhaps here we need to list:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number in the interval [0,1],\nthe function x^{-x} is integrable on [0,1],\nthe series ∑_{n=1}^∞ n^{-n} converges,\ninterchange of summation and integral is valid.\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't mention these, so maybe the user wants us to list only the conditions given in the problem. The problem mentions the integral from 0 to 1 and the sum from n=1 to infinity. The only explicit condition is the interval [0,1] for the integral and the summation index n starting at 1. However, the example included an assumption that n is an integer, which was part of the original problem's statement (\"for every integer n\"). So perhaps here, the assumptions are:\n\n- x is in [0,1],\n- n is a positive integer (since the sum starts at n=1).\n\nBut the problem is to equate the integral and the sum, not involving n in the integral. So maybe the assumption is just that the integral is over [0,1], and the sum is over positive integers n. But the example formatted the assumptions as properties of the variables in the problem. \n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to show the equality, maybe there are no specific assumptions beyond the integral being over [0,1] and the sum being from n=1 to ∞. Therefore, the Assumption section might be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is taken over the interval [0,1],\nThe summation is over positive integers n starting from 1.\n\nBut the example's assumptions were about the variable n. Here, the variables are x and n. However, in the problem statement, the equality doesn't involve n on the left side; the right side is a numerical series. So perhaps the key assumption is that the function x^{-x} can be expressed as a series that when integrated term by term gives the sum. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has no explicit assumptions beyond the integral and the sum as given. In the example, the user included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, but in the original problem, it was stated as \"for every integer n\". So perhaps here, since the problem is to prove an equality without any variables (the integral and the sum are both constants), there are no variables to list assumptions for. Wait, but the integral is a specific number, and the sum is another specific number, and the problem is to show they're equal. Therefore, there might not be any assumptions in terms of variables, but maybe conditions on the functions involved.\n\nHowever, the example included assumptions about n even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n\". So perhaps here, the assumptions are about the convergence of the integral and the series. But the user's example didn't include convergence assumptions, even though proving divisibility by 91 would require it. \n\nThis is a bit confusing, but perhaps the user's main point is to extract explicit conditions mentioned in the problem. The problem here states the integral from 0 to 1 of x^{-x} dx and the sum from n=1 to infinity of n^{-n}. The problem is to prove their equality. The only explicit conditions are the limits of integration and the summation bounds. Therefore, the assumptions might be:\n\n- The integral is computed over the interval [0,1].\n- The summation is taken from n=1 to ∞.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about the variable n. Here, perhaps the assumptions are similar:\n\n- x is in the interval [0,1].\n- n is a positive integer (n ≥ 1).\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't mention n in the integral side. The sum is over n, but the integral is over x. So maybe the assumption is that the equality holds for x in [0,1] and n in positive integers. However, the equality is between two constants, not depending on x or n. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the user expects that since the problem involves an integral and a series, the assumptions are the domains (x in [0,1], n ≥ 1 integers). Therefore, following the example's style, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number in the interval [0,1],\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ∫₀¹ x⁻ˣ dx equals ∑ₙ=₁^∞ n⁻ⁿ.\n\nBut in the example, they structured the problem by listing the variables' conditions. Here, x is part of the integral's domain, and n is the summation index. So those are the assumptions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem doesn't have any assumptions beyond what is given, so the Assumption section is empty. But the example shows that even if the problem states \"for every integer n\", they list it as an assumption. Therefore, following that, here we would list:\n\nAssumption:\nx is in the interval [0,1],\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ∫₀¹ x⁻ˣ dx = ∑ₙ=₁^∞ n⁻ⁿ.\n\nBut the original problem doesn't mention n being a positive integer explicitly; it's implicit in the summation notation. Similarly, the integral's limits are given as [0,1], so x is in that interval. \n\nTherefore, this seems reasonable. The example included \"n is an integer\" even though it was stated in the original problem. So here, even though n is part of the summation index (which by convention is an integer starting at 1), we list it as an assumption. \n\nAnother thing to consider: in the example, the original problem had a mistake in the formatted assumptions (adding n divisible by 7), but perhaps the user intended to show that assumptions are the conditions on the variables. In this problem, the variables are x and n, with x in [0,1] and n being positive integers. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list these as assumptions.",
