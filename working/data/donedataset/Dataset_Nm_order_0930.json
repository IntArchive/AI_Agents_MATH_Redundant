    "Content": "Somewhere on Stack Exchange I saw the equation $$\\gcd(2^m-1,2^n-1)=2^{\\gcd(m,n)}-1.$$ I had never seen this before, so I started trying to prove it. Without success... Can anyone explain me (so actually prove) why this equation is true? And can we say the same when replacing the '$2$' by any integer number '$a$'?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "In general, if $p=\\gcd(m,n)$ then $p=mx+ny$ for some integers $x,y$. Now, if $d = \\gcd(2^m-1,2^n-1)$ then $2^m \\equiv 1 \\pmod d$ and $2^n \\equiv 1\\pmod d$ so $$2^p = 2^{mx+ny} = (2^m)^x(2^n)^y \\equiv 1 \\pmod d$$ So $d\\mid 2^p-1$. On the other hand, if $p\\mid m$ then $2^p-1\\mid 2^m-1$ so $2^p-1$ is a common factor. And yes, you can replace $2$ with any $a$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to help structure this problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. Let me start by reading the original question carefully. The user is asking about proving that the gcd of 2^m -1 and 2^n -1 is equal to 2^{gcd(m,n)} -1. They also want to know if this holds when replacing 2 with any integer a. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem statement mentions gcd(2^m -1, 2^n -1) = 2^{gcd(m,n)} -1. So the main objects here are m and n, which are presumably integers since we're dealing with gcd. The assumptions would be that m and n are integers. Also, since the gcd is involved, m and n should be positive integers, right? Because gcd is usually defined for positive integers. But the original problem doesn't specify, so maybe the user assumes m and n are positive integers. However, in the example given by the user, they didn't list assumptions about the variables being integers unless it was part of the problem. Wait, in the example provided, the original problem states \"for every integer n\" but in the formatted version, they list \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the original problem, n is an integer, but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. But in the example, the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7. Wait, perhaps that was a mistake in the example? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should be that n is an integer. But in the formatted problem, the user added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which might not be part of the original problem. Wait, maybe the example is different. Let me check.\n\nThe example given by the user is:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1 ) -6^n (3^n +2^n ) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems like the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", so perhaps the formatted example is incorrect, or maybe the user made a mistake. But maybe the example is intended to show how to list assumptions, even if the original problem didn't state them. Hmm, confusing. So perhaps in the problem we're supposed to extract all implicit assumptions.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question is about gcd(2^m -1, 2^n -1) = 2^{gcd(m,n)} -1. So to state assumptions, first, m and n must be positive integers because gcd is defined for positive integers. Also, 2^m -1 and 2^n -1 are integers. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- m is a positive integer\n- n is a positive integer\n\nBut does the problem need any other assumptions? For example, if m or n were zero, then 2^0 -1 is 0, which might complicate the gcd. But since gcd is usually considered for positive integers, m and n are likely positive integers. So those are the assumptions. The problem is to prove the equation. Also, the user asks if replacing 2 with any integer a works, so that's part of the problem statement.\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem split into \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But that seems like an error. Because in the original problem, the divisibility by 7 was not mentioned. Wait, maybe the user in the example made a mistake, but in our case, we need to follow the instructions: \"filter the unrelated information and structure the problem as the format\". So we need to list all assumptions from the problem. The problem here is to prove the gcd equation, so the assumptions are m and n are positive integers. The problem statement doesn't specify, but since we're dealing with gcd, it's standard to assume positive integers.\n\nAlso, the second part of the problem is whether replacing 2 with any integer a holds. So that's part of the problem. So the problem is two parts: prove the equation for 2^m -1 and 2^n -1, and then whether it generalizes to any integer a.\n\nSo structuring this:\n\nAssumption:\nm is a positive integer,\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\gcd(2^m - 1, 2^n - 1) = 2^{\\gcd(m,n)} - 1.$$ \nAnd determine whether the same holds when replacing $2$ with any integer $a$.\n\nBut the user might have intended the problem to include the general case as a separate part. Alternatively, maybe the assumption is that a is an integer greater than 1? But the original problem doesn't specify, so perhaps not. So the main problem is the one stated, and the second part is an additional question. So in the Problem section, we need to include both.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants the problem to be split into two parts. But according to the example, the problem is written as one problem. So combining both parts into the problem statement.\n\nSo the final formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nm is a positive integer,\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\gcd(2^m - 1, 2^n - 1) = 2^{\\gcd(m,n)} - 1.$$ \nCan the same equality be extended by replacing $2$ with any integer $a$?\n\nAlternatively, using the exact wording from the original question: \"And can we say the same when replacing the '2' by any integer number 'a'?\"\n\nSo yes, the problem includes both proving the original equation and addressing the generalization.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have assumptions that m and n are positive integers, and the problem statement as given.",
