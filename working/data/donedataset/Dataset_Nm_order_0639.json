    "Content": "The question is #$14$ from Chapter $2$ in Stein and Shakarchi's text Complex Analysis : Suppose that $f$ is holomorphic in an open set containing the closed unit disc, except for a pole at $z_0$ on the unit circle. Show that if $$\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_nz^n$$ denotes the power series expansion $f$ in the open unit disc, then $$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{a_n}{a_{n+1}}=z_0.$$ I've shown that we can take $z_0=1$ without a loss of generality, but I'm having trouble showing the proof otherwise. One of the problems I'm having is because we aren't told the definition of a pole except that it is a place where the function isn't holomorphic. Disregarding this fact, the other problem I'm running into is that I don't know the order of the pole. Making some additional assumptions, including that the pole is simple so we can write $F(z)=(z-1)f(z)$ as a holomorphic function, we see that $$F(z)=-a_0+z(a_0-a_1)+z^2(a_1-a_2)+\\cdots$$ This almost gets me to the end with these added assumptions, but I don't think it's quite enough (why do we know some of the $a_i$'s aren't $0$, for example). On another note, if we know $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{a_n}{a_{n+1}}$ exists, then it is easy to see that $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{|a_n|}{|a_{n+1}|}=1=|z_0|$; I, however, do not see why the limit must exist. Are there any hints that someone can provide? Even a solution would be nice, especially if one can avoid making any assumptions about what a pole is or is not. EDIT : So there isn't any confusion, I know the definition of a pole and I'm inclined to believe that the problem, as stated, necessarily has a pole at $z_0$. The problem is that the exercise is in Chapter $2$, and poles are introduced in Chapter $3$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I will assume we can write $$f(z) = \\frac{c}{z_0-z} + \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} b_n z^n$$ for some value of $c \\ne 0$, and $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} b_n = 0$.  Then $$f(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n z^n$$ where $$a_n = b_n + \\frac{c}{z_0^{n+1}}$$ Then $$\\begin{align}\\lim_{n \\to \\infty}  \\frac{a_n}{a_{n+1}} &= \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\displaystyle b_n + \\frac{c}{z_0^{n+1}}}{\\displaystyle b_{n+1}+ \\frac{c}{z_0^{n+2}}}\\\\ &= \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\displaystyle  \\frac{c}{z_0^{n+1}}}{\\displaystyle  \\frac{c}{z_0^{n+2}}}\\\\ &= z_0\\end{align}$$ as was to be shown.  Note that the second step above is valid because $z_0$ is on the unit circle. For a nonsimple pole, we may write $$f(z) = \\frac{c}{(z_0-z)^m} + \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} b_n z^n$$ for $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$.  It might be known that $$(1-w)^{-m} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{m-1+n}{m-1} w^n$$ Then $$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty}  \\frac{a_n}{a_{n+1}} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{n+1}{n+m} z_0$$ EDIT @TCL observed that we can simply require that $b_n z_0^n$ goes to zero as $n \\to \\infty$.  Then for a simple pole $$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty}  \\frac{a_n}{a_{n+1}} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\displaystyle b_n z_0^n + \\frac{c}{z_0}}{\\displaystyle b_{n+1} z_0^n + \\frac{c}{z_0^2}}$$ which you can see goes to $z_0$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to structure this problem following the required format. The original question is from Stein's Complex Analysis, Chapter 2, Problem 14. The user wants to show that if a function f is holomorphic in an open set containing the closed unit disc except for a pole at z₀ on the unit circle, then the power series coefficients a_n of f in the unit disc satisfy lim a_n /a_{n+1} = z₀. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. Let's parse the problem statement. \n\nAssumptions should be one per line, each addressing a single property or condition applied to one object. Let me go through the problem step by step.\n\n1. The function f is holomorphic in an open set containing the closed unit disc. So, open set U contains the closed unit disc (|z| ≤ 1). But there's an exception: a pole at z₀ on the unit circle (|z₀| = 1). So f has a pole at z₀. \n\nWait, the problem says \"except for a pole at z₀ on the unit circle\". So the open set around the closed unit disc includes points around the unit circle, but f is holomorphic everywhere except at z₀ where it has a pole. \n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n- f is holomorphic in an open set containing the closed unit disc except at z₀.\n- z₀ is a pole of f.\n- z₀ lies on the unit circle (since it's on the unit circle, |z₀| = 1).\n- The power series expansion of f in the open unit disc is Σ a_n z^n.\n\nWait, the problem states that the power series expansion is in the open unit disc. So even though f has a pole on the boundary (unit circle), the expansion is inside the disc where it's holomorphic. \n\nBut the key assumptions here are:\n\n1. f is holomorphic in an open set containing the closed unit disc except at z₀.\n2. z₀ is a pole of f.\n3. The power series expansion of f in the open unit disc is Σ_{n=0}^∞ a_n z^n.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says \"except for a pole at z₀ on the unit circle\". So the open set containing the closed unit disc includes a neighborhood around the closed disc, except at z₀ where there's a pole. So maybe:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- f is holomorphic in an open set U containing the closed unit disc \\ {z₀}.\n- z₀ is a point on the unit circle (|z₀|=1).\n- f has a pole at z₀.\n- The power series expansion of f in the open unit disc is Σ_{n=0}^∞ a_n z^n.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. So each bullet point should be a separate line. Let me check:\n\n- \"f is holomorphic in an open set containing the closed unit disc, except for a pole at z₀ on the unit circle.\" This can be split into two:\n\n1. f is holomorphic in an open set U containing the closed unit disc except at z₀.\n2. f has a pole at z₀.\n\nBut the location of z₀ is on the unit circle. So:\n\n3. z₀ is on the unit circle (|z₀| = 1).\n\nAlso, the power series expansion is given as Σ a_n z^n in the open unit disc. So:\n\n4. The power series expansion of f in the open unit disc is Σ_{n=0}^∞ a_n z^n.\n\nBut the problem statement is to show that the limit of a_n /a_{n+1} is z₀. The assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. So:\n\nAssumption lines:\n\n- f is holomorphic in an open set containing the closed unit disc except at z₀,\n- z₀ is a pole of f,\n- z₀ lies on the unit circle,\n- The power series expansion of f in the open unit disc is Σ_{n=0}^∞ a_n z^n.\n\nEach of these is a single assumption. Let's check each:\n\n1. \"f is holomorphic in an open set containing the closed unit disc except at z₀\" – correct. The open set includes the closed disc, except z₀ where there's a pole.\n\n2. \"z₀ is a pole of f\" – the problem states that there's a pole at z₀.\n\n3. \"z₀ lies on the unit circle\" – yes, as given.\n\n4. \"The power series expansion... is Σ a_n z^n in the open unit disc\" – correct.\n\nSo these four assumptions.\n\nThe problem is to show that lim_{n→∞} a_n /a_{n+1} = z₀.\n\nIn the example given by the user, the assumption includes both the divisibility by 7 and n being integer. Here, the assumptions are about the function's holomorphicity, the pole location, and the power series.\n\nSo the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is holomorphic in an open set containing the closed unit disc except at z₀,\nz₀ is a pole of f,\nz₀ lies on the unit circle,\nthe power series expansion of f in the open unit disc is ∑_{n=0}^∞ a_n z^n.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{a_n}{a_{n+1}}=z_0.$$\n\nWait, but in the example, the user split the assumptions line by line. Let me check the example again:\n\nIn the example:\n\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that... \n\nSo each assumption is a separate line. So here, each bullet point is a line.\n\nThus:\n\nAssumption:\nf is holomorphic in an open set containing the closed unit disc except at z₀,\nz₀ is a pole of f,\nz₀ lies on the unit circle,\nthe power series expansion of f in the open unit disc is ∑_{n=0}^∞ a_n z^n.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{a_n}{a_{n+1}}=z_0.$$\n\nYes, this seems correct. The problem mentions the power series expansion in the open unit disc, and the function's properties. The key is to split each assumption into separate lines, each addressing one condition. The problem is to show the limit of a_n / a_{n+1} equals z₀.",
