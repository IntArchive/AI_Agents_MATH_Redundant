    "AcceptedAnswer": "Assume that $(\\mathbb Q,+)$ is finitely generated. Then, by the fundamental theorem there exist $m,n\\ge 0$ and $d_1\\mid\\cdots\\mid d_m$ with $d_i>1$ such that $\\mathbb Q\\simeq \\mathbb Z/d_1\\mathbb Z\\oplus\\cdots\\oplus\\mathbb Z/d_m\\mathbb Z\\oplus \\mathbb Z^n$. If $m\\ge 1$, then there exists $x\\in\\mathbb Q$, $x\\neq 0$, such that $d_1x=0$, a contradiction. Thus we get $m=0$. Then $\\mathbb Q\\simeq \\mathbb Z^n$. If $n\\ge 2,$ then there exist $x_1,x_2\\in\\mathbb Q$ which are linearly independent over $\\mathbb Z$. But $x_1=a_1/b_1$ and $x_2=a_2/b_2$ give $(b_1a_2)x_1+(-b_2a_1)x_2=0$, a contradiction. So we must have $n=1$, that is, $\\mathbb Q$ is cyclic. Assume that it is generated by $a/b$ with $b\\ge 1$. Then $\\frac{1}{b+1}$ can not be written as $\\frac{ka}{b}$, and again we reached to a contradiction. (Of course, there are simpler and much more natural arguments to show that $(\\mathbb Q,+)$ is not finitely generated.) Edit. In particular, this shows that the additive group of any field of characteristic $0$ is not finitely generated. (However the property holds for any infinite field.)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to figure out how to use the Fundamental Theorem of Finitely Generated Abelian Groups to show that (ℚ, +) isn't finitely generated. Let me start by recalling what the theorem says. The Fundamental Theorem states that every finitely generated abelian group is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups. These can be either infinite cyclic groups (like ℤ) or finite cyclic groups of prime power order.\n\nNow, the problem is about (ℚ, +), the additive group of rational numbers. First, I should remember what it means for a group to be finitely generated. A group is finitely generated if there exists a finite set of elements in the group such that every element can be expressed as a combination (in this case, a sum since the operation is addition) of those generators. For example, ℤ is finitely generated by {1}, but ℚ might not be.\n\nThe user wants to use the Fundamental Theorem here. So, assuming for contradiction that ℚ is finitely generated, then according to the theorem, ℚ would have to be a direct product of cyclic groups. But all the cyclic groups in the decomposition are either ℤ or finite cyclic groups. However, ℚ is a divisible group. What's a divisible group? In an additive group, divisible means that for every element x in the group and every positive integer n, there exists an element y such that ny = x. For example, in ℚ, you can always divide by n: y = x/n exists in ℚ.\n\nBut cyclic groups like ℤ aren't divisible. Take ℤ: if you try to divide an element by 2, say, you might not get an integer. Similarly, finite cyclic groups aren't divisible either. For example, in ℤ/5ℤ, if you take the element 1 and try to divide by 2, there's no element y such that 2y = 1 mod 5. So, the direct product of such groups would also not be divisible, because divisibility is preserved under direct products? Wait, no. If all components are divisible, then the product is divisible. But ℤ isn't divisible, so any product involving ℤ would not be divisible. Since ℚ is divisible, but a finitely generated abelian group (according to the theorem) would be a product of ℤ's and finite cyclic groups, none of which are divisible, except maybe the trivial group. Therefore, such a product can't be divisible, which contradicts the fact that ℚ is divisible. Hence, ℚ cannot be finitely generated.\n\nWait, but does the Fundamental Theorem directly address divisible groups? Maybe I need to structure this more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: If ℚ were finitely generated, then by the Fundamental Theorem, it would be isomorphic to ℤ^r × T, where T is a finite abelian group (the torsion part). But ℚ is torsion-free, right? Because in the additive group, torsion elements have finite order, but all non-zero elements of ℚ have infinite order. So, T must be trivial. Therefore, ℚ would have to be isomorphic to ℤ^r for some r. But ℤ^r is not divisible. For example, in ℤ, there's no element y such that 2y = 1. However, ℚ is divisible. Therefore, we have a contradiction, so ℚ cannot be finitely generated.\n\nSo the key points are: 1) If ℚ were finitely generated, by the theorem, it would be isomorphic to ℤ^r. 2) ℤ^r is not divisible, but ℚ is. Therefore, contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the problem is structured as using the Fundamental Theorem to show that a finitely generated abelian group must be a product of cyclic groups, which cannot be divisible, whereas ℚ is divisible. Hence, not finitely generated.",
