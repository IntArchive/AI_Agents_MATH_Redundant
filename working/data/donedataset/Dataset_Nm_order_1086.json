    "Content": "Let $S_k(n)$, for $k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots$, be defined as follows $$S_k(n) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\ i^k$$ For fixed (small) $k$, you can determine a nice formula in terms of $n$ for this, which you can then prove using e.g. induction. For small $k$ we for example get $$\\begin{align}\nS_0(n) &= n\\\\\nS_1(n) &= \\frac{1}{2}n^2 + \\frac{1}{2}n \\\\\nS_2(n) &= \\frac{1}{3}n^3 + \\frac{1}{2}n^2 + \\frac{1}{6}n \\\\\nS_3(n) &= \\frac{1}{4}n^4 + \\frac{1}{2}n^3 + \\frac{1}{4}n^2 \\\\\nS_4(n) &= \\frac{1}{5}n^5 + \\frac{1}{2}n^4 + \\frac{1}{3}n^3 - \\frac{1}{30}n\n\\end{align}$$ The coefficients of these polynomials are related to the Bernoulli-numbers, and getting arbitrary coefficients in these polynomials (i.e. the coefficient of $n^m$ in $S_k(n)$ for large $k,m$) is not so easy. However, th first two coefficients follow a simple pattern: the coefficient of $n^{k+1}$ is $\\frac{1}{k+1}$ and the coefficient of $n^k$ (for $k > 0$) is always $\\frac{1}{2}$. My main question now is: How can we prove that $S_k(n) = \\frac{1}{k+1}n^{k+1} + \\frac{1}{2}n^k + O(n^{k-1})$ for $k > 0$? The first coefficient can be explained intuitively, as $$S_k(n) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\ i^k \\approx \\int_{i=1}^n i^k di \\approx \\frac{n^{k+1}}{k+1}$$ Maybe you could make this more rigorous, but I don't see how you will get the term $\\frac{1}{2}n^k$ with this. Also, while the coefficient of $n^{k+1}$ can be explained intuitively, it's not clear to me why the coefficient of $n^k$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$, and why this one is fixed while e.g. the coefficient of $n^{k-1}$ is different for different $k$. If someone could explain that, that would be appreciated as well. Thanks.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem based on the given example. The user wants me to act as a math professor, read the Math Stack Exchange question, filter out unrelated info, and format it into the specified structure with Assumptions and Problem.\n\nFirst, let's look at the original question. The title is about the asymptotic behavior of sums of consecutive powers. The user defines S_k(n) as the sum from i=1 to n of i^k. They mention formulas for small k, the relation to Bernoulli numbers, and the difficulty in getting arbitrary coefficients. The main question is proving that S_k(n) = (1/(k+1))n^{k+1} + (1/2)n^k + O(n^{k-1}) for k > 0. They also want an explanation for the 1/2 coefficient and why it's fixed.\n\nNow, to format this into the required structure. The Assumptions section should list each condition line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. Then the Problem section states the problem concisely.\n\nLooking at the example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is about S_k(n). The key assumptions here would be:\n\n- k is a non-negative integer (since k = 0,1,2,...)\n- k > 0 (since the problem statement specifies for k > 0)\n- The sum S_k(n) is defined as the sum from i=1 to n of i^k\n- The asymptotic expansion is considered as n becomes large (since it's about O(n^{k-1}))\n  \nWait, but the problem statement doesn't mention any restrictions on n other than being part of the sum. However, the asymptotic behavior (O notation) implies that n is large. But maybe the main assumption is that k is a fixed positive integer. The problem is to prove the asymptotic formula.\n\nSo, the assumptions would be:\n\n- k is a positive integer\n- S_k(n) is defined as the sum from i=1 to n of i^k\n- The asymptotic expansion is considered as n approaches infinity\n\nBut the user example lists each assumption line by line. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe problem says: \"How can we prove that S_k(n) = [expression] for k > 0?\" The key conditions here are that k is a positive integer, and S_k(n) is the sum as defined. The O notation implies asymptotic behavior as n grows, so maybe that's an implicit assumption. The example included assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" which wasn't in the original. Wait, that example seems to have a mistake. Wait, the original problem said \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" Then in the formatted problem, the assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the user provided an example where they mistakenly added an assumption? Because the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7. Wait, perhaps the example is wrong? Because in the original problem, the user said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That would actually change the problem. So maybe there was a mistake in the example.\n\nBut the user is providing that example as part of their instructions, so even if it's wrong, I should follow their format. However, in the current problem, there is no such added assumption. The user is asking to filter out unrelated information and list assumptions from the problem. So, in the given problem, the key assumptions are:\n\n- k is a positive integer (since the problem states k > 0)\n- S_k(n) is the sum from i=1 to n of i^k\n- The asymptotic expansion is considered (so as n approaches infinity)\n\nBut the problem as stated by the user doesn't have additional constraints, so perhaps the only explicit assumption is that k is a positive integer, and S_k(n) is defined as that sum. The O notation is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- k is a positive integer\n- S_k(n) is defined as the sum from i=1 to n of i^k\n\nThen the problem is to prove that S_k(n) equals that expression with the big O term.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nk is a positive integer,\nS_k(n) is defined as $\\sum_{i=1}^n i^k$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$S_k(n) = \\frac{1}{k+1}n^{k+1} + \\frac{1}{2}n^k + O(n^{k-1})$$ for $k > 0$.\n\nI think that's the correct structure. The key is to list each assumption separately. The problem statement is already clear. The original question also asks about explaining the coefficients, but the main problem as structured here is to prove the asymptotic formula. However, the user's example focused on extracting the problem and assumptions, even if some parts were edited. So I need to filter out the extra explanations and just present the core problem with its assumptions.",
