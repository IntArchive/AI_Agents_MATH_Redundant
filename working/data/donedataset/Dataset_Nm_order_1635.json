    "Content": "How do you prove the following fact about the transpose of a product of matrices? Also can you give some intuition as to why it is so. $(AB)^T = B^TA^T$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here's an alternative argument. The main importance of the transpose (and this in fact defines it) is the formula $$Ax\\cdot y = x\\cdot A^\\top y.$$ (If $A$ is $m\\times n$ , then $x\\in \\Bbb R^n$ , $y\\in\\Bbb R^m$ , the left dot product is in $\\Bbb R^m$ and the right dot product is in $\\Bbb R^n$ .) Now note that $$(AB)x\\cdot y = A(Bx)\\cdot y = Bx\\cdot A^\\top y = x\\cdot B^\\top(A^\\top y) = x\\cdot (B^\\top A^\\top)y.$$ Thus, $(AB)^\\top = B^\\top A^\\top$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual mathematics professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example they provided involved listing assumptions line by line and then stating the problem. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the original question from Math Stack Exchange: \"How do you prove the following fact about the transpose of a product of matrices? Also can you give some intuition as to why it is so. $(AB)^T = B^TA^T$.\" \n\nThe task is to filter out unrelated information and structure it into the Assumption and Problem sections. The example given had assumptions that were conditions or properties applied to one object each. \n\nLooking at the matrix transpose problem, the key elements here are matrices A and B. The main fact to prove is that the transpose of their product is equal to the product of their transposes in reverse order. \n\nNow, for assumptions, what do we need? In linear algebra, when dealing with matrix multiplication and transposes, there are implicit assumptions. For the product AB to be defined, the number of columns in A must equal the number of rows in B. Also, once transposed, the dimensions should align for B^T and A^T to be multiplied. However, in the statement $(AB)^T = B^T A^T$, the only assumptions needed are that A and B are matrices such that their product AB is defined. Because if AB is defined, then B^T and A^T will automatically have compatible dimensions for multiplication (since the transpose swaps rows and columns). \n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n- A is a matrix.\n- B is a matrix.\n- The product AB is defined (i.e., the number of columns in A equals the number of rows in B).\n\nBut the original problem statement doesn't specify any particular conditions on A and B beyond them being matrices where the product is defined. The question is general. So in the assumption section, each line should address one property or condition applied to one object. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a matrix,\nB is a matrix,\nthe product AB is defined.\n\nProblem: Prove that $(AB)^T = B^T A^T$ and provide intuition for this result.\n\nWait, but in the example provided, the assumption included \"$n$ is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted version, it's specified as an assumption. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, the expression is divisible by 91. The formatted problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that might be a mistake? Wait no, the original example might have been different. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example:\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems conflicting. The original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be an error in the example, perhaps. But maybe in the example, the user intended to filter out that 91 is 7*13, so the problem might require n to be such that divisibility by 7 and 13 holds. But the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so perhaps there was a misrepresentation in the example. However, the user is providing that example as how they want the format to be. So, following that example, even if the original problem states \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem lists assumptions (maybe extracting conditions from the problem). \n\nBut in our case, the matrix transpose problem doesn't have explicit conditions except that A and B can be multiplied. So the assumptions should list that A and B are matrices, their product is defined. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem as stated doesn't need assumptions beyond A and B being matrices. But in linear algebra, the product AB is defined only when the number of columns of A equals the number of rows of B. So perhaps that's an implicit assumption. \n\nSo following the example's structure, each assumption is a single property or condition on one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a matrix,\nB is a matrix,\nthe number of columns in A is equal to the number of rows in B.\n\nProblem: Prove that $(AB)^T = B^T A^T$ and provide intuition for this result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are just that A and B are matrices such that AB is defined, which is equivalent. But breaking it down into separate lines, each addressing one property. \n\nBut in the example, the original problem's assumption that n is an integer was separated from the divisibility by 7. So here, perhaps the assumptions would be:\n\n- A is a matrix with dimensions m×n,\n- B is a matrix with dimensions n×p,\n- AB is a product matrix with dimensions m×p,\n\nBut maybe that's overcomplicating. The key is that the product AB is defined, which requires that the number of columns of A equals the number of rows of B. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- A is a matrix,\n- B is a matrix,\n- The product AB is defined.\n\nBut each of these in separate lines. Then the problem is to prove the transpose equality.\n\nAdditionally, the user also asks to \"give some intuition as to why it is so,\" so the problem part should include both proving and providing intuition.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a matrix,\nB is a matrix,\nthe product AB is defined.\n\nProblem: Prove that $(AB)^T = B^T A^T$ and provide intuition for this result.\n\nI think that's the correct way. Each assumption is a single line, one property per line, applied to one object. The problem includes both the proof and the intuition. The original question didn't specify any particular restrictions on the matrices (like being square or invertible), so the assumptions are general.",
