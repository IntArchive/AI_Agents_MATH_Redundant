I know that's a very common theorem in calculus but when I try to prove it with $\\epsilon$ - $\\delta$ definition of continuity, I found that it is not so obvious.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants to prove that if a function is differentiable at a point, then it's also continuous there using the epsilon-delta definition. I remember from my calculus classes that differentiability implies continuity, but proving it rigorously with epsilon-delta might require some careful steps.\n\nFirst, let's recall the definitions. A function f is differentiable at a point 'a' if the limit of [f(x) - f(a)]/(x - a) as x approaches 'a' exists, which is the derivative f'(a). The epsilon-delta definition of differentiability would then be: for every epsilon > 0, there exists a delta > 0 such that whenever 0 < |x - a| < delta, the absolute value of [f(x) - f(a)]/(x - a) - f'(a) is less than epsilon.\n\nNow, continuity at 'a' means that the limit of f(x) as x approaches 'a' is f(a). In epsilon-delta terms: for every epsilon > 0, there exists a delta > 0 such that if |x - a| < delta, then |f(x) - f(a)| < epsilon.\n\nSo the goal is to start from the differentiability condition and manipulate it to get the continuity condition. Let's see. Starting with the differentiability, we have that [f(x) - f(a)]/(x - a) is close to f'(a) when x is near 'a'. If we multiply both sides by (x - a), we get f(x) - f(a) ≈ f'(a)(x - a). Then, adding f(a) to both sides gives f(x) ≈ f(a) + f'(a)(x - a). As x approaches 'a', the term f'(a)(x - a) goes to zero, so f(x) approaches f(a), which is continuity.\n\nBut to do this rigorously with epsilon-delta, let's formalize that. From differentiability, for any epsilon > 0, there exists a delta such that |[f(x) - f(a)]/(x - a) - f'(a)| < epsilon when |x - a| < delta. Let's rearrange this inequality. Multiply both sides by |x - a| to get |f(x) - f(a) - f'(a)(x - a)| < epsilon |x - a|. Then, using the triangle inequality, |f(x) - f(a)| <= |f(x) - f(a) - f'(a)(x - a)| + |f'(a)(x - a)| < epsilon |x - a| + |f'(a)| |x - a|. Factor out |x - a| to get |f(x) - f(a)| < |x - a| (epsilon + |f'(a)|).\n\nNow, to make this less than some desired epsilon_continuity, we need to ensure that |x - a| (epsilon + |f'(a)|) < epsilon_continuity. To do this, perhaps we can choose epsilon in the differentiability condition appropriately. Let's say we want |x - a| (epsilon + |f'(a)|) < epsilon_continuity. Let's set epsilon to 1 in the differentiability condition first. Then there exists a delta_1 such that for |x - a| < delta_1, |[f(x)-f(a)]/(x - a) - f'(a)| < 1. Then, from the previous inequality, |f(x) - f(a)| < |x - a| (1 + |f'(a)|). Now, to make this less than epsilon_continuity, we can set delta to be the minimum of delta_1 and epsilon_continuity / (1 + |f'(a)|). That way, if |x - a| < delta, then |x - a| < epsilon_continuity / (1 + |f'(a)|), so |f(x) - f(a)| < (epsilon_continuity / (1 + |f'(a)|)) * (1 + |f'(a)|) ) = epsilon_continuity.\n\nWait, but this approach uses setting epsilon in differentiability to 1, but maybe there's a more direct way. Alternatively, for a given epsilon_continuity, choose epsilon in the differentiability condition as epsilon_continuity divided by something. Let me think.\n\nSuppose we are given epsilon > 0. We need to find delta > 0 such that |x - a| < delta implies |f(x) - f(a)| < epsilon. From differentiability, we know that for any epsilon_diff > 0, there exists delta_diff > 0 such that if |x - a| < delta_diff, then |[f(x) - f(a)]/(x - a) - f'(a)| < epsilon_diff. Let's rearrange that inequality to |f(x) - f(a) - f'(a)(x - a)| < epsilon_diff |x - a|. Then, using triangle inequality, |f(x) - f(a)| <= |f'(a)(x - a)| + epsilon_diff |x - a| = |x - a| (|f'(a)| + epsilon_diff).\n\nNow, we want |x - a| (|f'(a)| + epsilon_diff) <= epsilon. To achieve this, we can set epsilon_diff to 1 (arbitrary choice to bound the term), but maybe better to set epsilon_diff = 1, then choose delta accordingly. Wait, perhaps a better approach is to set epsilon_diff = 1, then get delta_1 such that for |x - a| < delta_1, |[f(x)-f(a)]/(x - a) - f'(a)| < 1. Then, |f(x) - f(a)| <= |x - a|(|f'(a)| + 1). Then, to make this < epsilon, choose delta = min(delta_1, epsilon / (|f'(a)| + 1)). Then, if |x - a| < delta, then |x - a| < epsilon / (|f'(a)| + 1), so |f(x)-f(a)| <= (epsilon / (|f'(a)| +1 )) * (|f'(a)| +1 ) = epsilon. Hence, that works. So the key steps are:\n\n1. From differentiability, get an expression involving |f(x) - f(a)| in terms of |x - a|.\n2. Use triangle inequality to split into two terms, one involving the derivative's epsilon and the other the derivative's value.\n3. Choose delta appropriately to bound both terms.\n\nTherefore, the proof would involve taking the given epsilon for continuity, using the differentiability to find a delta that controls the expression, adjusting delta to ensure both the differentiability condition and the bound from |x - a| multiplied by |f'(a)| plus the epsilon from differentiability. This should give the required delta for continuity.\n\nWait, but in the original attempt by the user, they tried to use the triangle inequality and got |f(x)-f(a)| < epsilon + |f'(a)(x -a)|. But they were concerned that |f'(a)(x -a)| could be large. So maybe their mistake was not handling the delta properly. The key is to relate delta to epsilon such that both terms are controlled. So perhaps they need to choose delta such that |x -a| is small enough to make |f'(a)(x -a)| < epsilon/2 and the other term also < epsilon/2. That way, the sum is less than epsilon.\n\nYes, that's a standard technique. Let me formalize that. Given epsilon > 0, we need to make |f(x) - f(a)| < epsilon. Let's split it into two parts: |f(x) - f(a)| <= |f(x) - f(a) - f'(a)(x -a)| + |f'(a)(x -a)|. We want each term < epsilon/2. \n\nFor the second term, |f'(a)(x -a)| < epsilon/2. So we need |x -a| < epsilon/(2 |f'(a)|), assuming f'(a) is not zero. If f'(a) is zero, that term is zero, so no problem. So we set delta_2 = epsilon/(2 |f'(a| + 1) to avoid division by zero. Wait, but if f'(a) is zero, delta_2 can be anything. Alternatively, handle the case where f'(a) is zero separately. But maybe it's better to write delta_2 as min(1, epsilon/(2 (|f'(a)| + 1)) ). But perhaps it's cleaner to split into two cases.\n\nAlternatively, since f'(a) is a constant, we can set delta_1 such that when |x -a| < delta_1, the first term is less than epsilon/2, and delta_2 such that |x -a| < delta_2 makes the second term less than epsilon/2. Then take delta as the minimum of delta_1 and delta_2.\n\nFor the first term, from differentiability, we have that for any epsilon_1 > 0, exists delta_1 > 0 such that |x -a| < delta_1 implies |[f(x)-f(a)]/(x -a) - f'(a)| < epsilon_1. Multiply both sides by |x -a| to get |f(x)-f(a) - f'(a)(x -a)| < epsilon_1 |x -a|. To make this < epsilon/2, we can set epsilon_1 = epsilon/(2 delta_1), but since delta_1 is dependent on epsilon_1, this might be circular. Instead, perhaps set epsilon_1 = 1 and delta_1 accordingly, but that might not work. Alternatively, set epsilon_1 = epsilon/(2 M), where M is some bound on |x -a|. Wait, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, here's a better approach: For the first term, since we want |f(x)-f(a)-f'(a)(x -a)| < epsilon/2, from differentiability, we can choose epsilon_1 = epsilon/(2 delta_2), where delta_2 is chosen for the second term. But this might complicate things. Alternatively, choose delta such that |x -a| < delta implies both that |[f(x)-f(a)]/(x -a) - f'(a)| < epsilon/(2 delta) and |x -a| < delta. But this seems circular because delta is in the denominator.\n\nWait, perhaps the standard approach is to first bound |x -a| by 1, then find the appropriate delta. Let's try that. Let's choose delta as the minimum of 1 and some other value. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nGiven epsilon > 0, we need to find delta > 0 such that |x -a| < delta implies |f(x) - f(a)| < epsilon.\n\nFrom differentiability at a, we have that for any epsilon_1 > 0, there exists delta_1 > 0 such that if 0 < |x -a| < delta_1, then |[f(x) - f(a)]/(x -a) - f'(a)| < epsilon_1. This implies |f(x) - f(a) - f'(a)(x -a)| < epsilon_1 |x -a|.\n\nNow, we can write |f(x) - f(a)| <= |f(x) - f(a) - f'(a)(x -a)| + |f'(a)(x -a)| < epsilon_1 |x -a| + |f'(a)| |x -a| = |x -a| (epsilon_1 + |f'(a)|).\n\nWe need |x -a| (epsilon_1 + |f'(a)|) < epsilon.\n\nLet's choose epsilon_1 = 1 (arbitrary positive number) first. Then there exists delta_1 such that for |x -a| < delta_1, |f(x) - f(a)| < |x -a| (1 + |f'(a)|). To make this less than epsilon, we need |x -a| < epsilon / (1 + |f'(a)|). So set delta = min(delta_1, epsilon / (1 + |f'(a)|)). Then, if |x -a| < delta, then |x -a| < delta_1 and |x -a| < epsilon / (1 + |f'(a)|), so |f(x) - f(a)| < (epsilon / (1 + |f'(a)|)) * (1 + |f'(a)|) = epsilon. Hence, this works.\n\nSo the key idea is to use the differentiability to get a bound involving |x -a| multiplied by (epsilon_1 + |f'(a)|), then choose delta such that |x -a| is small enough to make that product less than epsilon. By setting epsilon_1 to 1 and adjusting delta accordingly, we can achieve the desired bound for continuity.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to note that differentiability implies that the limit of [f(x) - f(a)] as x approaches a is zero. Because:\n\nlim_{x→a} [f(x) - f(a)] = lim_{x→a} [ (f(x) - f(a))/(x -a) ) * (x -a) ] = f'(a) * 0 = 0. Hence, lim_{x→a} f(x) = f(a), which is continuity.\n\nBut this uses limit laws rather than epsilon-delta directly. To make it via epsilon-delta, the previous steps are necessary.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the proof would start by assuming f is differentiable at a, then take an arbitrary epsilon > 0, use the definition of differentiability to find delta_1 and set delta appropriately to bound both terms from the triangle inequality, ensuring the total is less than epsilon.",
