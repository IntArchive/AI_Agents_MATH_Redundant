    "Content": "I want to prove that in an infinite dimensional normed space $X$ , the weak closure of the unit sphere $S=\\{ x\\in X : \\| x \\| = 1 \\}$ is the unit ball $B=\\{ x\\in X : \\| x \\| \\leq 1 \\}$ . $\\\\$ Here is my attempt with what I know: I know that the weak closure of $S$ is a subset of $B$ because $B$ is norm closed and convex, so it is weakly closed, and $B$ contains $S$ .

    "AcceptedAnswer": "With the same notations in you question: Notice that if $x_i^*(x) = 0$ for all $i$ , then $x \\in U$ , and therefore the intersection of the kernels $\\bigcap_{i=1}^n \\mathrm{ker}(x_i^*)$ is in $U$ . Since the codimension of $\\mathrm{ker}(x^*_i)$ is at most $1$ , then the intersection has codimension at most $n$ (exercise: prove this). But since $X$ is infinite dimensional, this means the intersection has an infinite dimension, and in particular contains a line. Since any line going through $0$ intersects $S$ , then $U$ intersects $S$ . The same argument can be applied to any point in $B$ (any line going through a point in $B$ intersects $S$ ), and since you've proved the other inclusion, the weak closure of $S$ is $B$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to format this problem according to the user's instructions. The original question is about proving that the weak closure of the unit sphere S in an infinite-dimensional normed space X is the unit ball B. The user wants me to extract the assumptions and the problem statement in the specified format.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. Let me read through the question again carefully.\n\nThe problem mentions that X is an infinite-dimensional normed space. That's one assumption. The unit sphere S is defined as {x ∈ X : ||x|| = 1}, and the unit ball B is {x ∈ X : ||x|| ≤ 1}. The goal is to show that the weak closure of S is B.\n\nLooking at the user's example, they listed each assumption line by line. So here, the key points are:\n\n1. X is an infinite-dimensional normed space.\n2. S is the unit sphere in X, defined as {x ∈ X : ||x|| = 1}.\n3. B is the unit ball in X, defined as {x ∈ X : ||x|| ≤ 1}.\n\nWait, but the problem statement also mentions that B is norm closed and convex, hence weakly closed. But are these part of the assumptions or part of the reasoning? The user's example included assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" which were given in the problem. In this case, the original problem states that X is infinite-dimensional, and defines S and B. So the assumptions are about the space X and the definitions of S and B. The fact that B is weakly closed because it's norm closed and convex is part of the reasoning, not an assumption given in the problem. Therefore, the assumptions should include:\n\n- X is an infinite-dimensional normed space.\n- S is the unit sphere in X (with the given definition).\n- B is the unit ball in X (with the given definition).\n\nBut in the problem, the user is trying to show the weak closure of S is B. The initial part of the user's question states that they already know that the weak closure of S is a subset of B, and they need to show the reverse inclusion. So the problem is to prove that B is a subset of the weak closure of S.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list the assumptions about X, S, and B, then state the problem as proving that the weak closure of S is B.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is a separate line. Let me check again:\n\nAssumption 1: X is an infinite-dimensional normed space.\nAssumption 2: S is the unit sphere in X, defined as S = {x ∈ X : ||x|| = 1}.\nAssumption 3: B is the unit ball in X, defined as B = {x ∈ X : ||x|| ≤ 1}.\n\nBut wait, the original problem doesn't explicitly state that S and B are defined as such; it just mentions them. But in the context, they are standard definitions. However, the user included definitions in their example. For instance, in the example, the problem defines A(n) as a specific expression. So here, the definitions of S and B are part of the problem's setup. Therefore, they should be listed as assumptions.\n\nHence, the assumptions are:\n\n- X is an infinite-dimensional normed space.\n- The unit sphere S is defined as S = {x ∈ X : ||x|| = 1}.\n- The unit ball B is defined as B = {x ∈ X : ||x|| ≤ 1}.\n\nBut the problem statement in the example included the expression for A(n) in the problem section. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91, but the user's formatted problem included the definition of A(n) in the problem statement. Similarly, here, the problem is to prove that the weak closure of S is B. So the problem statement should include the definitions of S and B as part of the problem, not as assumptions. Wait, but the user's example listed n being an integer and n being divisible by 7 as assumptions. Hmm, perhaps in this case, the definitions of S and B are part of the problem statement rather than assumptions. Wait, maybe the assumptions are only the given conditions, and the problem statement includes the definitions.\n\nWait, looking back at the example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nBut in the original problem, the user had n being an integer, but the formatted assumption included both n being an integer and n divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the assumption was \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, perhaps the example had a mistake. Wait, looking at the example:\n\nOriginal problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. Then the formatted problem's assumption lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect because in the original problem, it's for every integer n, but the formatted problem adds that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Maybe the user made an error in the example. But regardless, following the user's instruction, we need to structure the problem given here.\n\nIn the current problem, the user says \"Prove that in an infinite dimensional normed space X, the weak closure of the unit sphere S is the unit ball B.\" So the key assumptions here are:\n\n- X is an infinite-dimensional normed space.\n- S is the unit sphere (defined as ||x||=1).\n- B is the unit ball (defined as ||x|| ≤1).\n\nSo the problem is to show that the weak closure of S is B. Therefore, the assumptions should list the properties of X, S, and B. Each on a separate line.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nX is an infinite-dimensional normed space,\nS is the unit sphere in X defined as S = {x ∈ X : ||x|| = 1},\nB is the unit ball in X defined as B = {x ∈ X : ||x|| ≤ 1}.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the weak closure of S is B.\n\nWait, but the original problem mentions that B is norm closed and convex, hence weakly closed, but that's part of the reasoning. The problem statement itself is to prove that the weak closure of S is B. Therefore, the assumptions are the definitions and the space being infinite-dimensional. The problem is to prove the inclusion both ways, but the user already knows that the weak closure of S is a subset of B, so the problem reduces to proving B is a subset of the weak closure of S.\n\nBut according to the user's instruction, the problem should be stated as given. So the problem is to prove that the weak closure of S is B. Hence, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nX is an infinite-dimensional normed space,\nS is the unit sphere in X defined as S = {x ∈ X : ||x|| = 1},\nB is the unit ball in X defined as B = {x ∈ X : ||x|| ≤ 1}.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the weak closure of S is B.\n\nI think that's correct. Each assumption is a single property or condition applied to one object. The problem is to prove the weak closure of S is B. The original problem mentions that the user is aware that the weak closure of S is contained in B and needs to show the reverse inclusion. But according to the format, the problem is stated as the original problem, which is to prove the equality of the weak closure of S and B. Therefore, the formatted problem should include all three assumptions as listed and state the problem as proving that the weak closure of S is B.",
