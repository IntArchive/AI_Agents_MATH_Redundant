    "Content": "I am given $f \\in C^2([0,\\infty))$ and $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty}f(x) = L\n \\in \\mathbb{R}$ . I am also given there is a real number $M$ such that $f'(x) + f''(x) < M$ for all $x \\in [0,\\infty)$ . Prove that $\\lim_{x\n \\to \\infty}f'(x) = 0$ . My thoughts This is similar to a frequently asked question: If $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty}f(x) = L$ then if $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f'(x)= L'$ exists it is necessary that $L' = 0$ . Possible approaches are: (1) Originally I thought to show upper bound on $f' + f''$ along with $f(x) \\to L$ guarantees that the limit of $f'$ exists. but I just realized the function $f(x) = \\sin(x^2)/x$ is a counterexample. (2) Somehow use the Taylor expansion $f(y) = f(x) + f'(x)(y-x) + \\frac{1}{2} f''(\\xi)(x-y)^2$ ( $\\xi \\in (x,y)$ ). Here I am having difficulty tying $f'$ and $f''$ together to use the bound.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Rearranging the Taylor expansion with the integral remainder , $$f(x+h) = f(x) + f'(x) h + \\int_x^{x+h} (x+h-t)f''(t) \\,  dt,$$ we get $$f'(x)h = f(x+h) - f(x)+\\int_x^{x+h} (x+h-t)f'(t)\\,  dt - \\int_x^{x+h} (x+h-t)[f'(t) + f''(t)]\\,  dt$$ Using integration by parts and the mean value theorem with $\\theta \\in (0,1)$ , the first integral is $$\\int_x^{x+h} (x+h-t)f'(t)\\,  dt = f(x)h - \\int_x^{x+h}f(t) \\, dt = f(x)h-f(x+\\theta h)h,$$ and the second integral is bounded as $$ \\int_x^{x+h} (x+h-t)[f'(t) + f''(t)]\\,  dt \\leqslant M\\int_x^{x+h} (x+h-t)\\,  dt = \\frac{Mh^2}{2}$$ Altogether we have $$f'(x)h \\geqslant f(x+h) - f(x) +f(x)h - f(x+\\theta h) h - \\frac{Mh^2}{2}$$ Dividing both sides by $h \\in (0,1)$ , we get $\\liminf_{x \\to \\infty}f'(x) \\geqslant -\\frac{Mh}{2}$ since the limits of all terms involving $f$ cancel out. This implies $\\liminf_{x \\to \\infty}f'(x) \\geqslant 0$ since $h$ can be arbitrarily close to $0$ . Similarly, dividing by $h \\in (-1,0)$ we can show that $\\limsup_{x \\to \\infty}f'(x) \\leqslant 0$ , and therefore, $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f'(x) = 0$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. So the goal is to prove that the derivative of a function f tends to 0 as x approaches infinity, given some conditions. Let me start by restating the problem to make sure I understand it.\n\nWe have a function f that's twice continuously differentiable on the interval [0, ∞). We know that the limit of f(x) as x approaches infinity is some real number L. Also, there's a real number M such that the sum of the first and second derivatives, f'(x) + f''(x), is less than M for all x in [0, ∞). We need to show that the limit of f'(x) as x goes to infinity is 0.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the assumptions clearly. The user provided an example where they structured the problem by listing each assumption line by line. So I need to do the same here.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n1. f is in C²([0, ∞)), meaning f is twice continuously differentiable on [0, ∞).\n2. The limit of f(x) as x approaches infinity is L, a real number.\n3. There exists a real number M such that f'(x) + f''(x) < M for all x in [0, ∞).\n\nProblem: Prove that the limit of f'(x) as x approaches infinity is 0.\n\nNow, the user wants the problem structured in a specific format where each assumption addresses one property or condition applied to one object. Let me check if I covered all the points.\n\n1. The first assumption is about the smoothness of f (C²) on the interval. That's one condition.\n2. The second is about the limit of f(x) being L. That's another condition.\n3. The third is the existence of M such that f' + f'' is bounded above by M. That's a third condition.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption, each applying to f or its derivatives. So the structured problem should look like that.\n\nWait, in the example given, they had two assumptions for the original problem where n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in the original problem here, the user's problem has three separate assumptions. So the formatting would list each of those three points as separate lines under Assumption.\n\nNow, let's make sure there are no other hidden assumptions. The original problem says \"f ∈ C²([0,∞))\", \"lim_{x→∞}f(x) = L ∈ ℝ\", and \"there is a real number M such that f'(x) + f''(x) < M for all x ∈ [0,∞)\". So those are the three key points. The user also mentions that the problem is to prove that f'(x) approaches 0 as x approaches infinity. So the structured problem should capture all that.\n\nI should check if there are any other conditions implied. For example, does the boundedness of f' + f'' from above include any lower bounds? The problem states that f' + f'' is bounded above by M, but not necessarily bounded below. However, in the assumptions, we don't need to mention the lower bound unless it's part of the problem's given conditions. Since the problem only states an upper bound, that's all we need to include.\n\nAnother point: the problem mentions that the user thought about using Taylor expansion but had difficulty tying f' and f'' together. However, in structuring the problem, we don't need to include their thoughts or attempted approaches. The task is to filter out unrelated information and structure the problem with its assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nSo the final structured problem should be as follows:\n\nAssumption:\nf is twice continuously differentiable on [0, ∞),\nThe limit of f(x) as x approaches infinity is a real number L,\nThere exists a real number M such that f'(x) + f''(x) < M for all x in [0, ∞).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the limit of f'(x) as x approaches infinity is 0.\n\nEach assumption is on a separate line, each addressing one condition. The problem statement is then presented clearly.",
