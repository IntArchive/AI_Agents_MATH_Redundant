    "Content": "From its definition a combination $\\binom{n}{k}$, is the number of distinct subsets of size $k$ from a set of $n$ elements. This is clearly an integer, however I was curious as to why the expression $$\\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$ always evaluates to an integer. So far I figured: $n!$, is clearly divisible by $k!$, and $(n-k)!$, individually, but I could not seem to make the jump to proof that that $n!$ is divisible by their product.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "See my post here for a simple purely arithmetical proof that every binomial coefficient is an integer. The proof shows how to rewrite any binomial coefficient fraction as a product of fractions whose denominators are all coprime to any given prime $\\rm\\:p.\\,$ This implies that no primes divide the denominator (when written in lowest terms), therefore the fraction is an integer. The key property that lies at the heart of this proof is that, among all products of $\\rm\\, n\\,$ consecutive integers, $\\rm\\ n!\\ $ has the least possible power of $\\rm\\,p\\,$ dividing it - for every prime $\\rm\\,p.\\,$ Thus $\\rm\\ n!\\ $ divides every product of $\\rm\\:n\\:$ consecutive integers, since it has a smaller power of every prime divisor. Therefore\n$$\\rm\\displaystyle\\quad\\quad {m \\choose n}\\ =\\ \\frac{m!/(m-n)!}{n!}\\ =\\ \\frac{m\\:(m-1)\\:\\cdots\\:(m-n+1)}{\\!\\!n\\:(n-1)\\   \\cdots\\:\\phantom{m-n}1\\phantom{+1}}\\ \\in\\ \\mathbb Z$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example they provided involved breaking down the problem's assumptions and the main question. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The question is about why the combination formula n choose k is an integer, specifically why n! divided by k!(n-k)! is always an integer. The user mentioned that they know n! is divisible by k! and (n-k)! individually but can't see why it's divisible by their product.\n\nNow, according to the example, the Assumptions section should list each condition applied to one object. In the original example, they listed that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in this case, the problem is about combinations. The key assumptions here would be the definitions involved. Let me think: the combination formula is defined for integers n and k where 0 ≤ k ≤ n. So the assumptions would be that n and k are integers, and that k is between 0 and n inclusive. \n\nWait, the original problem doesn't explicitly state the conditions on n and k, but since it's about combinations, those are implicit assumptions. So I need to list those. Each assumption should be a single line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nk is an integer,\nk is greater than or equal to 0,\nk is less than or equal to n.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that n!/(k!(n-k)!) is an integer. \n\nI need to check if there are any other assumptions. The problem mentions that it's clear from the definition that combinations are integers, but the expression is the formula. So the main assumptions are about n and k being integers with 0 ≤ k ≤ n. \n\nYes, that seems right. So the formatted problem would list those four assumptions (each on a separate line) and then state the problem as proving that the expression is an integer. Let me make sure there's no other hidden assumption. The user didn't mention any other constraints, so these are the necessary ones. Alright, I think that's it.",
