    "Content": "I'd like to prove to my (undergraduate, not math-major) students that\n$$\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^3}\\sum_{k=1}^n k^2 =\\frac{1}{3},\n$$\nto later show them that this can be interpreted as taking Riemann sums for the integral of $x^2$. Of course I could pull out of my hat the formula $\\sum_{k=1}^n k^2 = \\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$, which makes it obvious, or start from the telescopic sum \n$$\\sum_{k=1}^n ((k+1)^3-k^3)\n$$\nand do some algebra. Neither of them sounds very convincing to me, since they will be new ideas for them, not immediate to grasp, and this should not be the central point of my lecture. Is there a simpler way to work out this limit, without going through a proof for the value of the sum?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "There are a couple of ways to make this limit seem intuitive. The sum of the squares can be interpreted as a square pyramid ; the volume of such a pyramid is approximately $\\frac{1}3 n^{3}$. Another method could be to just calculate some of the partial sums. For example, $$\\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^{10}k^{2}}{10^{3}}=0.385 \\approx 1/3$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to prove that the limit of (1/n³) times the sum of squares from k=1 to n is 1/3, without delving into the exact formula for the sum of squares. The goal is to make it intuitive for undergraduate students who aren't math majors, possibly using Riemann sums as a later connection to integrals.\n\nFirst, I need to recall that the sum of squares is known to be approximately n³/3 for large n. But how to show this without the exact formula? The user mentioned avoiding the telescoping sum method and the direct formula. Maybe there's a way to approximate the sum using integrals or some asymptotic analysis.\n\nAnother thought: since the limit is about the average or the sum divided by n³, maybe comparing it to an integral. The Riemann sum approach usually involves dividing the interval [0,1] into n parts, each of width 1/n, and summing the function at those points. If we consider the function f(x) = x², then the sum (1/n³)Σk² can be rewritten as (1/n)Σ(k/n)² * (1/n), which is like the Riemann sum for the integral of x² from 0 to 1. Wait, but that would give (1/n³)Σk² ≈ ∫₀¹ x² dx = 1/3, which is exactly the limit. But the user says they want to show this later using Riemann sums, so maybe they want an alternative approach before introducing Riemann sums.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the concept that the sum can be approximated by an integral. For large n, the sum Σk² from k=1 to n is approximately the integral of x² from x=1 to n, but that doesn't directly give n³/3. Wait, integrating x² from 0 to n gives (n³)/3, which is the leading term. But the sum of squares is roughly the integral plus some correction terms. Maybe using the Euler-Maclaurin formula, but that's probably too advanced.\n\nAlternatively, consider that each term k² is like (n*(k/n))², so scaling the variable. If we let k = xn, where x ranges from 0 to 1, then k² = n²x², and the sum becomes Σn²x² from x=1/n to 1 in steps of 1/n. Multiplying by 1/n³ gives (1/n)Σx²*(1/n), which is the Riemann sum for ∫₀¹ x² dx. So maybe that's the way to present it, but the user wants to do this without relying on Riemann sums yet.\n\nAlternatively, use the idea that the sum of k² is dominated by the largest terms. For large n, most of the terms are near k = n, so k² ≈ n². But the number of terms is n, so sum is roughly n*n² = n³, and then dividing by n³ gives 1. But that's not matching the 1/3. So that approach is flawed.\n\nWait, perhaps using the comparison with the integral of x² from 0 to n. The integral ∫₀ⁿ x² dx = n³/3. The sum Σk² from 1 to n is an overestimate using right endpoints. The integral from 0 to n of x² dx is less than the sum, but for large n, the difference is lower order. So the sum is roughly n³/3 + lower order terms, so when divided by n³, the limit is 1/3. But to make this precise without using the exact formula, maybe use inequalities.\n\nFor example, for each k, the integral from k-1 to k of x² dx ≤ k² ≤ ∫k^{k+1} x² dx. Then summing over k from 1 to n, the left sum is ∫₀ⁿ x² dx = n³/3, and the right sum is ∫₁^{n+1} x² dx ≈ (n+1)^3/3 - 1/3 ≈ n³/3 + n² + n + ... So the sum Σk² is between n³/3 and (n+1)^3/3 -1/3. Then dividing by n³, both bounds approach 1/3 as n→∞. Hence by squeeze theorem, the limit is 1/3.\n\nThis approach uses integrals to bound the sum and applies the squeeze theorem, which might be accessible to students without needing the exact formula. It relies on understanding that the integral approximates the sum, which connects to Riemann sums but doesn't require the full machinery. The key steps would be setting up the inequalities with integrals and showing that both bounds converge to 1/3.",
