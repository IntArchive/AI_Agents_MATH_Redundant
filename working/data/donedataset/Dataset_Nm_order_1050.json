    "AcceptedAnswer": "I claimed in a comment on @Zander's answer that \"a cleaner diagram could even make [his 'Least Algebraic' proof] a Proof Without Words\". Well, I've done a cleaning pass for fun, but since the order of construction of the elements isn't necessarily clear, I'll offer a Proof With Words. (Actually, since I tried to reduce labeling clutter in the images, my prose has descriptor clutter, so that this is really a Proof With Way Too Many Words.) Given parabolas with foci $F$ and $G$ and common chord $AB$ (all marked with stars), let $C$ be the midpoint of $AB$, let $M$ and $N$ be the points where the perpendicular bisector of $AB$ meets the parabolas' axes (as shown), and let $O$ be the point on $MN$ such that $NO = CM$. In the first image, we drop a perpendicular from $C$, through $P$ on a parabola, to the corresponding directrix. Classic reflection properties ensure both that the tangent line through $P$ is parallel to $AB$, and that it is perpendicular to the hypotenuse of (green) $\\triangle F$. Consequently, that hypotenuse is parallel to $MN$, and we have $\\triangle F \\cong \\triangle N \\cong \\triangle O$; in particular, the height of $\\triangle O$ is congruent to the height of $\\triangle F$. Likewise, in the second figure, the perpendicular from $C$ determines $Q$, such that the tangent through $Q$ is parallel to $AB$ and perpendicular to the hypotenuse of (orange) $\\triangle G$. Thus, $\\triangle G \\cong \\triangle M \\cong \\triangle O$, with the width of $\\triangle G$ matching the width of $\\triangle O$. The upshot: The displacement of $O$ from the intersection of the parabolas' axes is determined by each parabola's focus-to-directrix distance, and is therefore independent of the choice of common chord $AB$. As $O$ lies on the perpendicular bisector of each such common chord, it is the center of a circle containing the four points of intersection of the two parabolas. Note. The displacement of $O$ from the axes is independent of the distance from $F$ to the axis through $G$, and independent of the distance from $G$ to the axis through $F$. That is, we can move the \"$F$\" parabola up and down, and the \"$G$\" parabola left and right, and $O$ will remain the center of the circle containing the points of intersection. (Of course, the radius of the circle changes.) Interesting. Note. My figure cheats a little, because I approximated parabolas with ellipses in Photoshop (which really isn't the best tool for this job).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the task is to prove that the four intersection points of two parabolas with axes of symmetry forming a right angle all lie on a common circle. The user is asking for a non-algebraic solution, so I need to think geometrically rather than just crunching equations.\n\nFirst, let me recap the problem. We have two parabolas. Their axes of symmetry are perpendicular to each other. For example, one could open upwards with a vertical axis, and the other opens to the right with a horizontal axis. But the problem states that the axes form a right angle, which could also mean they are at some other 90-degree orientation, not necessarily aligned with the coordinate axes. Wait, the example given in the algebraic solution uses coordinate axes, so maybe the standard setup is where one parabola has a vertical axis and the other has a horizontal axis. That would make their axes perpendicular.\n\nBut the key here is that their axes are perpendicular. The algebraic solution introduced a coordinate system where one parabola is y = α₁x² + β₁ and the other is x = α₂y² + β₂. So, the first parabola is standard vertical, the second is a horizontal parabola. Their axes are the y-axis and x-axis respectively, which are perpendicular. Then by manipulating the equations, they derived a circle equation, showing that all intersection points lie on that circle.\n\nBut the user wants a non-algebraic solution. So, maybe a geometric approach using properties of parabolas and circles.\n\nLet me recall that the intersection points of two conic sections (like two parabolas) lie on a curve of degree at most 4. But since both are parabolas (degree 2), their intersection is at most 4 points. The problem states that all four lie on a circle (degree 2). So, that suggests that the two conics (parabolas) are such that their intersection is contained in another conic (the circle). So, perhaps using properties of radical axes or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to construct the circle geometrically. Let's think about the geometric properties of parabolas with perpendicular axes.\n\nSuppose we have two parabolas: one with vertical axis (let's say opening upwards) and another with horizontal axis (opening to the right). Let their equations be y = a x² + c and x = b y² + d. Their intersections satisfy both equations. If we substitute one into the other, we get a system that leads to a quartic equation, which can have up to four solutions. The algebraic approach combines the equations and manipulates them into a circle equation, proving that all solutions lie on that circle.\n\nBut how to see this geometrically? Let me think about the definition of a parabola. A parabola is the set of points equidistant from the focus and directrix. Maybe using the focus-directrix property. If we can relate the foci and directrices of both parabolas to the circle, perhaps.\n\nAlternatively, since the axes are perpendicular, maybe reflecting points across the axes or using symmetry. If the two parabolas have perpendicular axes, their intersection points might have symmetries that force them onto a circle.\n\nWait, another approach: inversion. Maybe inverting the parabolas to circles or lines. But inversion might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, think about the power of a point with respect to a circle. If the four intersection points lie on a circle, then for each point, the power with respect to that circle is zero. But how does that help in proving existence?\n\nAlternatively, consider that two conics intersecting in four points lie on a pencil of conics. The circle would be a member of that pencil. But that might be more algebraic.\n\nWait, but the problem assumes that there exist four intersection points. So, we don't have to prove existence, just that they lie on a circle.\n\nAlternatively, consider that when two parabolas with perpendicular axes intersect, their equations can be combined in such a way to form the equation of a circle. The algebraic solution does this by substituting one equation into the other and rearranging. But maybe there's a way to see this geometrically.\n\nSuppose we have the two parabolas: y = a x² + c and x = b y² + d. Let's try to substitute x from the second equation into the first equation: y = a (b y² + d)^2 + c. That would give a quartic equation in y. Similarly, substituting y from the first into the second would give a quartic in x. However, the algebraic solution instead adds or scales the equations to get a circle equation.\n\nIn the algebraic approach, they subtracted the equations or combined them linearly. Let's see: starting with y = α₁ x² + β₁ and x = α₂ y² + β₂. Maybe rearranging both equations to get expressions involving x² and y².\n\nLet me try to rearrange the first equation: y - β₁ = α₁ x² ⇒ x² = (y - β₁)/α₁\n\nSimilarly, the second equation: x - β₂ = α₂ y² ⇒ y² = (x - β₂)/α₂\n\nNow, if we take these expressions for x² and y² and substitute into the equation of a circle. The circle equation is (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2. Expanding this gives x² - 2 h x + h² + y² - 2 k y + k² = r^2. Substitute x² and y² from the parabola equations:\n\n(y - β₁)/α₁ - 2 h x + h² + (x - β₂)/α₂ - 2 k y + k² = r^2\n\nThis is a linear equation in x and y. For this to hold for all x and y (which it doesn't, unless coefficients of x and y are zero and constants match). But since we are looking for points that lie on both parabolas and the circle, perhaps the combination of the equations of the parabolas can be manipulated to form the circle equation.\n\nAlternatively, in the algebraic solution provided, they scaled and added the equations. Let me see. If we take the two equations:\n\n1. y = α₁ x² + β₁\n2. x = α₂ y² + β₂\n\nLet's rearrange them to:\n\nα₁ x² = y - β₁\nα₂ y² = x - β₂\n\nNow, if we square both sides, but that might complicate. Alternatively, perhaps adding these equations after scaling. For example, multiply the first equation by some factor and the second by another factor and add them. Let's see.\n\nSuppose we take the first equation: α₁ x² - y + β₁ = 0\nSecond equation: α₂ y² - x + β₂ = 0\n\nIf we add these two equations: α₁ x² + α₂ y² - x - y + β₁ + β₂ = 0\n\nBut this is a quadratic equation, but not necessarily a circle. A circle has x² and y² terms with equal coefficients (if coefficients are not equal, it's an ellipse or hyperbola). So, unless α₁ = α₂, but there's no such condition. However, in the algebraic solution, after scaling, they obtained a circle equation. So maybe they adjusted the equations by adding and subtracting terms.\n\nWait, the user's algebraic solution mentions \"by scaling, adding and simplifying we can get the following ordinary circle equation\". So, scaling the equations before adding them. For example, multiplying the first equation by a certain factor and the second by another, then adding.\n\nAlternatively, considering that we can manipulate the equations to get x² and y² terms with coefficients 1. For example, from the first equation:\n\nx² = (y - β₁)/α₁\n\nFrom the second equation:\n\ny² = (x - β₂)/α₂\n\nSo, substituting these into the circle equation. Suppose we want to form (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2. Expanding, that's x² - 2 h x + h² + y² - 2 k y + k² = r². Replace x² and y²:\n\n[(y - β₁)/α₁] - 2 h x + h² + [(x - β₂)/α₂] - 2 k y + k² = r²\n\nNow, collect like terms:\n\n(-2 h x) + (-2 k y) + (y / α₁) + (x / α₂) + ( - β₁ / α₁ - β₂ / α₂ + h² + k² ) = r²\n\nGroup x terms and y terms:\n\nx ( -2 h + 1/α₂ ) + y ( -2 k + 1/α₁ ) + ( - β₁ / α₁ - β₂ / α₂ + h² + k² ) = r²\n\nFor this to be a valid equation for all x and y on both parabolas (but actually, it's only required to hold for the intersection points), we can choose h and k such that the coefficients of x and y are zero. That is:\n\n-2 h + 1/α₂ = 0 ⇒ h = 1/(2 α₂)\n-2 k + 1/α₁ = 0 ⇒ k = 1/(2 α₁)\n\nThen, the constant term becomes:\n\n- β₁ / α₁ - β₂ / α₂ + (1/(2 α₂))² + (1/(2 α₁))² = r²\n\nHence, the equation of the circle is:\n\n(x - 1/(2 α₂))² + (y - 1/(2 α₁))² = - β₁ / α₁ - β₂ / α₂ + 1/(4 α₁²) + 1/(4 α₂²)\n\nWhich is exactly what the user's algebraic solution states. So, this shows that by choosing h and k appropriately, we can form a circle equation that the intersection points must satisfy. Since the intersection points satisfy both parabola equations, substituting those into the circle equation shows they lie on the circle.\n\nBut this is still algebraic. The user wants a non-algebraic solution. Maybe using geometric properties.\n\nLet me think differently. If two parabolas have perpendicular axes, their intersection points lie on a circle. What's special about the configuration?\n\nSuppose we have two parabolas, one opening up and one opening to the right. Let's consider their equations in a coordinate system where their vertices are at (h, k) and (p, q), but maybe it's simpler to take them as in the algebraic example: y = α₁ x² + β₁ and x = α₂ y² + β₂.\n\nA geometric approach might involve the concept of the locus of points satisfying certain conditions. Since each parabola is a locus (distance from focus equals distance from directrix), perhaps the four intersection points have equal power with respect to some circle.\n\nAlternatively, think about reflections. If you reflect one parabola over the line y = x, since the axes are perpendicular, maybe the reflected parabola relates to the other parabola in a way that their intersections lie on a circle.\n\nWait, if one parabola is y = α₁ x² + β₁ and the other is x = α₂ y² + β₂, reflecting over y = x would swap x and y. So reflecting the first parabola would give x = α₁ y² + β₁, which is similar to the second parabola's equation. If they are symmetric in some way after reflection, maybe their intersection points lie on the line y = x or some other symmetry line, but that might not directly lead to a circle.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the circle is the radical axis of two circles... Wait, the radical axis of two circles is the line where their equations subtract. But here, we have two parabolas. However, the radical axis concept is about points having equal power with respect to both circles. Maybe there's an analogous concept for parabolas, but I don't recall one.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that four points lie on a circle if the cross ratio is real, but that's more complex.\n\nWait, here's an idea. If we can find three points of intersection and show they lie on a circle, then the fourth must also lie on it because of the way the equations work. But the problem states there are four intersection points, so maybe using some symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, think of the circle as passing through the vertices of a rectangle or something. If the axes are perpendicular, maybe the intersection points form a rectangle whose vertices lie on a circle.\n\nBut how to see that? If the two parabolas have perpendicular axes, their intersections might form a quadrilateral symmetric with respect to both axes. If the quadrilateral is cyclic (i.e., lies on a circle), then its opposite angles sum to 180 degrees. But proving that geometrically might be tricky without coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, parametrize the points of intersection. Let's say for the first parabola, we can write parametric equations. For example, the parabola y = α₁ x² + β₁ can be parametrized as x = t, y = α₁ t² + β₁. The second parabola x = α₂ y² + β₂ can be parametrized as y = s, x = α₂ s² + β₂. The intersection points occur when t = α₂ s² + β₂ and s = α₁ t² + β₁. Substituting gives s = α₁ (α₂ s² + β₂)^2 + β₁, which is a quartic equation in s. The solutions correspond to the four points. But this seems algebraic again.\n\nAlternatively, use geometric transformations. Suppose we translate the coordinate system to the center of the circle. But how would we know where that is without algebra?\n\nWait, the algebraic solution gives the center of the circle as (1/(2 α₂), 1/(2 α₁)). Maybe this center has a geometric meaning related to the parabolas. Let me see.\n\nFor the first parabola y = α₁ x² + β₁, the vertex is at (0, β₁). The axis of symmetry is the y-axis. The focus is at (0, β₁ + 1/(4 α₁)) because for a parabola y = a x² + c, the focus is at (0, c + 1/(4a)). Similarly, the directrix is y = c - 1/(4a).\n\nFor the second parabola x = α₂ y² + β₂, the vertex is at (β₂, 0). The axis of symmetry is the x-axis. The focus is at (β₂ + 1/(4 α₂), 0), and the directrix is x = β₂ - 1/(4 α₂).\n\nNow, the center of the circle in the algebraic solution is (1/(2 α₂), 1/(2 α₁)). Notice that this is halfway between the vertex and the focus of each parabola. For the first parabola's focus at (0, β₁ + 1/(4 α₁)), the y-coordinate of the center is 1/(2 α₁). If β₁ is zero, then this would be halfway between the focus (0, 1/(4 α₁)) and the origin. But β₁ might not be zero. Wait, in the algebraic solution, the center is (1/(2 α₂), 1/(2 α₁)), regardless of β₁ and β₂. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the geometric significance of 1/(2 α₂) and 1/(2 α₁). For the first parabola, the latus rectum length is 1/α₁, and for the second, it's 1/α₂. The center of the circle is at half the latus rectum length along their respective axes. But I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, think about the common circle as related to the directrices or foci of the parabolas. Suppose the circle passes through the foci of both parabolas. But no, the foci are at different locations.\n\nAlternatively, consider that each intersection point lies on both parabolas, so their distances to the focus and directrix of each parabola are equal. Maybe combining those equalities could lead to a circle equation.\n\nFor a point (x, y) on the first parabola, distance to focus (0, β₁ + 1/(4 α₁)) equals distance to directrix y = β₁ - 1/(4 α₁)). Similarly, for the second parabola, distance to focus (β₂ + 1/(4 α₂), 0) equals distance to directrix x = β₂ - 1/(4 α₂)).\n\nSo, for a point (x, y) on both parabolas:\n\n√(x² + (y - (β₁ + 1/(4 α₁)))² = |y - (β₁ - 1/(4 α₁))|\n\nand\n\n√((x - (β₂ + 1/(4 α₂)))² + y²) = |x - (β₂ - 1/(4 α₂))|\n\nThese are the definitions of the parabolas. Squaring both equations:\n\nFor the first parabola:\nx² + (y - β₁ - 1/(4 α₁))² = (y - β₁ + 1/(4 α₁))²\n\nExpand the left and right:\n\nLeft: x² + y² - 2 y (β₁ + 1/(4 α₁)) + (β₁ + 1/(4 α₁))²\n\nRight: y² - 2 y (β₁ - 1/(4 α₁)) + (β₁ - 1/(4 α₁))²\n\nSubtracting right from left:\n\nx² - 2 y (β₁ + 1/(4 α₁)) + (β₁ + 1/(4 α₁))² + 2 y (β₁ - 1/(4 α₁)) - (β₁ - 1/(4 α₁))² = 0\n\nSimplify terms:\n\nx² - 2 y [ (β₁ + 1/(4 α₁)) - (β₁ - 1/(4 α₁)) ] + [ (β₁ + 1/(4 α₁))² - (β₁ - 1/(4 α₁))² ] = 0\n\nCompute the bracketed terms:\n\nFirst bracket: (β₁ + 1/(4 α₁)) - (β₁ - 1/(4 α₁)) = 2/(4 α₁) = 1/(2 α₁)\n\nSecond bracket: difference of squares: [A + B]^2 - [A - B]^2 = 4 A B. Here, A = β₁, B = 1/(4 α₁). So, 4 * β₁ * 1/(4 α₁) = β₁ / α₁\n\nThus, the equation becomes:\n\nx² - 2 y * (1/(2 α₁)) + β₁ / α₁ = 0 ⇒ x² - y / α₁ + β₁ / α₁ = 0 ⇒ x² = (y - β₁)/α₁\n\nWhich is the original equation of the first parabola. So that checks out.\n\nSimilarly, for the second parabola, after squaring, we get y² = (x - β₂)/α₂\n\nSo, combining these two equations gives x² = (y - β₁)/α₁ and y² = (x - β₂)/α₂. Then, as in the algebraic solution, substituting into the circle equation.\n\nBut this still feels algebraic. To find a non-algebraic solution, maybe using geometric transformations or properties.\n\nAnother approach: since the axes are perpendicular, we can consider rotating the coordinate system by 45 degrees, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, using coordinate geometry but in a more geometric way.\n\nWait, the problem mentions that the axes of symmetry form a right angle. Suppose we take the axes of symmetry as the x-axis and y-axis. Then, one parabola opens along the x-axis and the other along the y-axis. So, their equations would be something like y² = 4 a x and x² = 4 b y, but those are standard parabolas opening right and up, respectively. However, in the given example, the equations are y = α₁ x² + β₁ and x = α₂ y² + β₂, which are not in the standard form.\n\nBut let's consider the standard forms. If we take two parabolas: one opening to the right, y² = 4 a (x - h), and one opening upward, x² = 4 b (y - k). Their axes are perpendicular. Let's find their intersection points.\n\nSolving y² = 4 a (x - h) and x² = 4 b (y - k). Substitute x from the second equation into the first: y² = 4 a ( (4 b (y - k))^(1/2) - h ). That looks messy. Alternatively, solve one for x and substitute into the other.\n\nFrom x² = 4 b (y - k), we get y = (x²)/(4 b) + k. Substitute into y² = 4 a (x - h):\n\n[(x²)/(4 b) + k]^2 = 4 a (x - h)\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n(x^4)/(16 b²) + (k x²)/(2 b) + k² = 4 a x - 4 a h\n\nWhich is a quartic equation. The solutions are the x-coordinates of the intersection points. To show that these lie on a circle, we need to find a circle equation that is satisfied by these points.\n\nAlternatively, consider adding the two equations:\n\ny² - 4 a x + 4 a h + x² - 4 b y + 4 b k = 0\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nx² + y² - 4 a x - 4 b y + 4 a h + 4 b k = 0\n\nThis is the equation of a circle: x² + y² + D x + E y + F = 0, where D = -4 a, E = -4 b, F = 4 a h + 4 b k. Thus, the intersection points lie on this circle.\n\nWait, that's a key insight! If we add the two equations of the parabolas (after rearranging them to equal zero), we get the equation of a circle. Therefore, any point that lies on both parabolas must also lie on this circle.\n\nBut wait, the original equations are y² = 4 a (x - h) and x² = 4 b (y - k). If we rearrange them to y² - 4 a x + 4 a h = 0 and x² - 4 b y + 4 b k = 0. Adding these gives x² + y² - 4 a x - 4 b y + 4 a h + 4 b k = 0, which is indeed a circle. Hence, all intersection points of the two parabolas lie on this circle. Thus, the four intersection points lie on this circle.\n\nTherefore, the non-algebraic solution would be to recognize that adding the equations of the two parabolas (in standard form) yields the equation of a circle, hence their intersection points must lie on that circle.\n\nBut in the user's algebraic solution, they had different forms of the parabolas: y = α₁ x² + β₁ and x = α₂ y² + β₂. Let's see if adding those equations would also give a circle.\n\nIf we take y = α₁ x² + β₁ and x = α₂ y² + β₂. Rearranged: α₁ x² - y + β₁ = 0 and α₂ y² - x + β₂ = 0. Adding these gives α₁ x² + α₂ y² - x - y + β₁ + β₂ = 0. This is a quadratic equation but not necessarily a circle unless α₁ = α₂. However, in the user's algebraic solution, they did some scaling before adding. For example, multiplying the first equation by 1/α₁ and the second by 1/α₂ to make the coefficients of x² and y² equal to 1.\n\nSo, if we take the first equation: x² = (y - β₁)/α₁\n\nSecond equation: y² = (x - β₂)/α₂\n\nThen, adding these gives x² + y² = (y - β₁)/α₁ + (x - β₂)/α₂\n\nWhich can be rearranged to x² + y² - (x)/α₂ - (y)/α₁ + β₁/α₁ + β₂/α₂ = 0\n\nThis is a circle equation if we complete the squares. Let's do that:\n\nx² - (x)/α₂ + y² - (y)/α₁ + C = 0\n\nComplete the square for x:\n\nx² - (1/α₂)x = x² - (1/α₂)x + (1/(2 α₂))² - (1/(2 α₂))² = (x - 1/(2 α₂))² - 1/(4 α₂²)\n\nSimilarly for y:\n\ny² - (1/α₁)y = (y - 1/(2 α₁))² - 1/(4 α₁²)\n\nThus, substituting back:\n\n(x - 1/(2 α₂))² - 1/(4 α₂²) + (y - 1/(2 α₁))² - 1/(4 α₁²) + C = 0\n\nWhere C = β₁/α₁ + β₂/α₂\n\nThus,\n\n(x - 1/(2 α₂))² + (y - 1/(2 α₁))² = 1/(4 α₂²) + 1/(4 α₁²) - β₁/α₁ - β₂/α₂\n\nWhich is exactly the circle equation from the algebraic solution. Hence, by scaling the original equations (to express x² and y²) and adding them, we derive the circle equation. This shows that the intersection points lie on this circle.\n\nBut this is still algebraic manipulation. However, the key insight is that combining the equations of the two parabolas (after appropriate scaling) yields the equation of a circle, hence their intersections must lie on that circle. The geometric interpretation could be that the two parabolas' equations are constraints whose intersection naturally satisfies another constraint (the circle), which can be derived by linearly combining the original equations.\n\nThus, the non-algebraic solution would involve recognizing that the sum of the appropriately scaled equations of the parabolas forms a circle, and since the intersection points satisfy both original equations, they must also satisfy the combined equation (the circle). Therefore, all four points lie on the circle.\n\nBut to present this as a non-algebraic solution, we might need to frame it in geometric terms rather than algebraic manipulation. For example, noting that the condition of the parabolas having perpendicular axes allows their equations to be combined in a way that forms a circle, hence the intersections lie on that circle. However, this still feels somewhat algebraic. Perhaps another approach is needed.\n\nAnother geometric approach: consider that each parabola can be seen as the set of points equidistant from a focus and directrix. If we can relate the foci and directrices of the two parabolas to the circle, maybe there's a relationship. For instance, the circle could be the locus of points where the sum or difference of distances to the foci relates to the directrices in a certain way. However, I'm not sure how to make that connection explicit without algebra.\n\nAlternatively, using the concept of the director circle of a parabola, but the director circle is not a standard concept. For a parabola, the director circle is the set of points where the two tangents from the point to the parabola are perpendicular. I think the director circle of a parabola is a straight line (the directrix), but I need to verify.\n\nWait, for a parabola, the director circle (locus of points from which perpendicular tangents can be drawn to the parabola) is actually a line. For example, for the parabola y² = 4 a x, the director circle is the directrix x = -a. Because any point on the directrix, the two tangents to the parabola are perpendicular. So, in this case, the director circle is the directrix.\n\nBut this might not help directly. However, if we have two parabolas with perpendicular axes, their director circles (directrices) might intersect or have some relation to the common circle. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the common circle is orthogonal to both parabolas. Orthogonality of curves means their tangents are perpendicular at intersection points. But proving that the circle is orthogonal to both parabolas at the intersection points might not ensure that all intersections lie on the circle.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that four points lie on a circle if the pairwise angles subtended by chords are equal or something. But without specific points, this is abstract.\n\nPerhaps the only way to present a non-algebraic solution is to argue that since the axes are perpendicular, combining the equations of the parabolas after suitable scaling results in a circle's equation, hence their intersections must lie on that circle. Even though this involves some algebra, it's a more high-level explanation.\n\nIn conclusion, the non-algebraic solution hinges on recognizing that the two parabolas' equations can be linearly combined (after scaling) to form the equation of a circle, thereby proving that all intersection points lie on that circle. This is somewhat algebraic but can be framed geometrically as utilizing the perpendicularity of the axes to form a compatible circle equation.",
