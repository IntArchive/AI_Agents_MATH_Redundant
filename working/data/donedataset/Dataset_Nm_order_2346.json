    "Content": "For every monic polynomial $P$ of degree $n$ (with leading coefficient 1), it is well-known that $$\\max _{x \\in[-1,1]}|P(x)| \\geq \\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}.$$ A standard proof uses Chebyshev polynomials . Is there a proof which does not use Chebyshev polynomials?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I have come up with a (somewhat strange) proof that uses only the first Chebyshev polynomials $$Q_2(x) = 2x^2 - 1$$ I will use the fact that this is a surjection from $[-1, 1] \\to [-1, 1]$ . Define $$M(n) = 2^{n-1}\\inf_P \\max_{x \\in [-1, 1]}  |P(x)|.$$ where $P$ goes over monic polynomials of degree $n$ . The key steps of the proof are two facts. Fact 1: $M(2n) \\leq M(n)^2.$ Proof: If $P$ is a degree $n$ polynomial with $\\max_{x \\in [-1, 1]}  |P(x)| = \\alpha$ , then the polynomial $$P'(x) = 2^{-1} \\alpha^{2} Q_2(\\alpha^{-1}P(x))$$ is of degree $2n$ and satisfies $\\max_{x \\in [-1, 1]}  |P’(x)| = 2^{-1} \\alpha^{2}$ . Taking $\\alpha$ to be sufficiently close to $M(n)$ , we get $M(2n) \\leq M(n)^2$ . Fact 2: $M(n) \\leq M(2n).$ Proof: If $P'$ is a degree $2n$ polynomial with $\\max_{x \\in [-1, 1]} |P'(x)| = \\alpha$ , then $P'(x) + P'(-x)$ is an even polynomial. Thus we can write $$P'(x) + P'(-x) = 2^{-n+1} P(Q_2(x))$$ where $P$ is some monic polynomial of degree $n$ . Thus we have $\\max_{x \\in [-1, 1]} |P(x)| \\leq 2^{n}\\alpha$ . Taking $\\alpha$ to be sufficiently close to $M(2n)$ , we get $M(n) \\leq M(2n)$ . Combining the two parts, we conclude that $M(n) \\leq M(n)^2$ , so $M(n)$ is either at least $1$ or equal to $0$ . It suffices to show that $M(n)$ is not equal to $0$ . This is easy: for any monic $P$ of degree $n$ , one can find some $x \\in [-1, 1]$ that is distance at least $1/n$ from each root, so $M(n) \\geq (1/n)^n$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to format this problem according to the user's instructions. Let me start by understanding the original question.\n\nThe problem is about showing that the maximum absolute value of a monic polynomial P of degree n on the interval [-1,1] is at least 1/(2^{n-1}). The user mentions that the standard proof uses Chebyshev polynomials but asks for a proof without them.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. Let's parse the problem:\n\n- The polynomial P is monic. That means the leading coefficient is 1. So one assumption is \"P is a monic polynomial.\"\n- The degree of P is n. So another assumption is \"P has degree n.\"\n- The interval considered is [-1,1]. So \"x is in the interval [-1,1].\"\n\nWait, but in the example provided, assumptions are about the variables and conditions. The problem here is to show the inequality holds for every such polynomial. The key conditions are that P is monic, degree n, and we're looking at max |P(x)| over x in [-1,1]. The conclusion is that this max is at least 1/(2^{n-1}).\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n1. P is a monic polynomial.\n2. P has degree n.\n3. The maximum is taken over x in [-1,1].\n\nBut in the example given by the user, the original problem had an assumption about n being an integer and divisible by 7. However, in the problem here, the assumptions are all about P. The user's example split the assumptions into separate lines, each addressing one property. So here, each line would be:\n\nAssumption:\nP is a monic polynomial,\nP has degree n,\nThe maximum of |P(x)| is considered over x ∈ [-1,1].\n\nWait, but the third one is part of the problem statement, not an assumption about the object. Wait, the problem is to show that for every monic polynomial P of degree n, the max on [-1,1] is at least 1/(2^{n-1}).\n\nSo the assumptions are about P: it's monic, degree n. The interval [-1,1] is where we're taking the maximum. So perhaps the third assumption is that x is in [-1,1], but actually, the maximum is taken over that interval. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- P is a monic polynomial of degree n.\n- The maximum is computed over the interval [-1,1].\n\nBut the example given in the user's instruction split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" into separate lines. Similarly, here, maybe \"P is a monic polynomial\" and \"P has degree n\" as separate lines. So:\n\nAssumption:\nP is a monic polynomial,\nP has degree n,\nThe maximum is taken over x ∈ [-1,1].\n\nYes, each line addresses one property. Then the problem is to show that this maximum is at least 1/(2^{n-1}).\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nP is a monic polynomial,\nP has degree n,\nThe maximum of |P(x)| is considered over x ∈ [-1,1].\nProblem:\nShow that $$\\max _{x \\in[-1,1]}|P(x)| \\geq \\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}.$$\n\nWait, but in the original question, the user wrote \"without Chebyshev polynomials.\" But in the problem statement, do we need to include that as an assumption? No, because the problem is to find a proof that doesn't use Chebyshev polynomials. However, in the format provided, the \"Problem\" part is the actual mathematical statement to prove. The fact that the proof shouldn't use Chebyshev is part of the original question's request, but in the formatted problem, it's just the mathematical problem. The example given by the user didn't include the \"without Chebyshev\" part in the problem statement; the original problem had that as part of the question. So in the formatted version, the problem is to \"Show that...\" and the context about Chebyshev is part of the original question's request but not part of the problem's assumptions or statement.\n\nSo the correct formatted problem would list the assumptions about P and the interval, then the problem is to show the inequality.",
