The above is the case $p=-1$. (See the wiki for what $p$ is). The case $p=2$ appears here: Proving $A: l_2 \\to l_2$ is a bounded operator",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here is a proof. We try using induction, but as usual, a direct approach seems to fail and we have to try and prove a stronger statement. So we try and pick a positive function $f(n)$ such that $$ \\frac{f(n)}{a_1 + a_2 + \\dots + a_n} + \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{k}{a_1 + a_2 + \\dots + a_k} \\le \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\frac{2}{a_j}$$ Let $S = a_1 + a_2 + \\dots + a_n$ and let $x = a_{n+1}$ . In order to prove that $n$ implies $n+1$ it would be sufficient to prove $$\\frac{2}{x} + \\frac{f(n)}{S} \\ge \\frac{f(n+1) + n+1}{S+x}$$ This can be rearranged to $$2S^2 + f(n) x^2 + (f(n) + 2) Sx \\ge (f(n+1) + n+1) Sx$$ Since $$ 2S^2 + f(n) x^2 \\ge 2 \\sqrt{2 f(n)} Sx$$ it is sufficient to prove that $f(n)$ satisfies $$ f(n) + 2 + 2\\sqrt{2 f(n)} \\ge f(n+1) + n + 1$$ Choosing $f(n) = \\dfrac{n^2}{2}$ does the trick. We can easily verify the base case for this choice of $f(n)$ . Thus we have: $$ \\frac{n^2}{2(a_1 + a_2 + \\dots + a_n)} + \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{k}{a_1 + a_2 + \\dots + a_k} \\le \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\frac{2}{a_j}$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants me to structure the given math problem into assumptions and the problem statement based on the example provided. The original question is about proving a version of Hardy's inequality involving reciprocals for any sequence of positive numbers. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the original problem. The user mentioned that this is a version of Hardy's inequality, specifically when p = -1. But the example given in the problem statement has p=2. However, the user's main focus is on structuring the problem, not solving it.\n\nLooking at the example provided by the user, they listed each assumption line by line, each addressing a single property or condition applied to one object. In their example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. Then the problem statement was to prove the divisibility of A(n) by 91.\n\nNow, applying this to the current problem. The original question states: \"How can one prove for any sequence of positive numbers $a_n, n\\ge1,$ we have\n$$\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{n}{a_1+a_2+a_3+\\cdots+a_n}\\le 2\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{a_n}$$\"\n\nThe assumptions here would be about the sequence $a_n$. The key points are that the sequence consists of positive numbers and that the inequality involves sums up to infinity. Each assumption should be a single line. So:\n\n1. $a_n$ is a sequence of positive numbers.\n2. The index $n$ is greater than or equal to 1 (since the sequence starts at n=1).\n3. The sums involved are from n=1 to infinity (as indicated by the summation limits).\n\nThe problem statement is then to prove the given inequality. \n\nWait, but in the example, the assumptions included specific conditions like divisibility by 7. Here, the conditions are more general. The user might be expecting to list each assumption separately. Let me check again:\n\nThe original problem says \"any sequence of positive numbers $a_n, n\\ge1$\". So the key assumptions are:\n\n- Each term $a_n$ is positive.\n- The sequence is defined for all integers $n \\geq 1$.\n- The sums are taken from n=1 to infinity.\n\nBut the example given by the user split the assumptions into two lines: one about n being an integer and another about divisibility by 7. Similarly here, each condition should be separate. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n$a_n$ is a positive number for each $n \\geq 1$,\nThe sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ is defined for all integers $n \\geq 1$,\nThe sum $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{a_n}$ converges,\nThe sum $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{n}{a_1 + \\dots + a_n}$ converges.\n\nWait, but the problem statement is to prove the inequality, which might not require the sums to converge. However, if the sums don't converge, the inequality might not hold. Wait, actually, if the right-hand side sum diverges, the inequality would trivially hold because the left side would be finite or infinite. But since the problem states \"any sequence of positive numbers\", including those where the sums might diverge. However, in the context of inequalities involving infinite series, typically we consider cases where the sums are finite. Otherwise, the inequality is trivially true if the right-hand side is infinite. Therefore, maybe the assumption is that the right-hand side converges. But the problem statement doesn't specify that. The user's example didn't include convergence assumptions, but the original problem here says \"for any sequence of positive numbers\", which could include divergent series. However, the inequality as stated would be meaningful even if both sides are infinite, but in such a case, the inequality would hold as both sides are infinity. So maybe the real meat is when the right-hand side converges, implying the left-hand side also converges and is bounded by twice the right-hand side. But the problem doesn't specify convergence; it just states the inequality. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions are just that each $a_n$ is positive, and the sequence is defined for all $n \\geq 1$. The user in the example didn't list convergence as an assumption; they listed properties about n and the divisibility. So perhaps here, the assumptions are just the positivity and the domain of the sequence.\n\nTherefore, structured as:\n\nAssumption:\n$a_n$ is a positive number for each $n \\geq 1$,\nThe sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ is defined for all integers $n \\geq 1$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that \n$$\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{n}{a_1+a_2+\\cdots+a_n}\\le 2\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{a_n}.$$\n\nBut wait, in the original example, they included the divisibility condition as an assumption. However, in the problem here, the only conditions are the positivity of $a_n$ and that the sequence is defined for all $n \\geq 1$. Therefore, those are the two assumptions. Each in a separate line. The problem is to prove the inequality.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the index n is an integer, but in the problem statement, n is already defined as an integer in the sequence (since it's a sequence over n ≥ 1). So perhaps that's redundant. Let me check the example again. In the example, they wrote:\n\nAssumption: \nn is an integer,\nn is divisible by 7.\n\nSo they broke down separate conditions. So here, similarly, the assumptions would be:\n\n- For each integer $n \\geq 1$, $a_n$ is a positive number.\n\nBut maybe split into:\n\n$a_n$ is a positive number for each integer $n \\geq 1$,\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user just wrote \"any sequence of positive numbers\", so perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n$a_n$ is a sequence of positive numbers,\nEach term $a_n$ is defined for integers $n \\geq 1$.\n\nBut maybe even more simply:\n\nEach $a_n$ is a positive real number,\nThe sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ is indexed by integers $n \\geq 1$.\n\nBut the example was very concise. In the example, the assumptions were just two lines: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Here, similarly, the two main assumptions are that each a_n is positive and the sequence is over n ≥1. So that would be two lines.\n\nThus, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n$a_n$ is a positive number for each integer $n \\geq 1$,\nThe sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ is defined for all integers $n \\geq 1$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that \n$$\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{n}{a_1+a_2+\\cdots+a_n}\\le 2\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{a_n}.$$\n\nWait, but the second assumption seems redundant because if each $a_n$ is defined for each $n \\geq 1$, then the sequence is already defined for all such n. So maybe the first assumption covers both positivity and the domain. However, in the example, they separated \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, perhaps \"each $a_n$ is positive\" and \"the sequence is defined for all integers $n \\geq 1$\". But perhaps the second part is implicit in the first. However, to follow the example strictly, maybe we should list them separately. Alternatively, maybe \"each term $a_n$ is a positive real number\" and \"the index $n$ ranges over integers $n \\geq 1$\". That way, each assumption is about one property.\n\nAlternatively, the original problem states \"any sequence of positive numbers $a_n, n\\ge1$\", which implies that for each n ≥1 (integer), a_n is positive. So to split that into two assumptions:\n\n1. $a_n$ is a positive real number for each integer $n \\geq 1$.\n2. The sequence is defined for all integers $n \\geq 1$.\n\nBut this seems redundant. Maybe in the example, the user split \"n is integer\" and \"n divisible by 7\" because those are two separate conditions. Here, the two conditions are that the sequence is defined for n ≥1 and each term is positive. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ is defined for all integers $n \\geq 1$,\nEach term $a_n$ is a positive real number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that \n$$\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{n}{a_1+a_2+\\cdots+a_n}\\le 2\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{a_n}.$$\n\nYes, this seems correct. Each assumption is one line, addressing a single property. The first ensures the sequence is defined for all relevant n, the second ensures positivity. Then the problem is to prove the inequality.",
