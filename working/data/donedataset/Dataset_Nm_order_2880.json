    "Content": "I would like to prove the convergence of $$I=\\int_0^{+\\infty}\\left( \\frac1{\\log(x+1)-\\log x}-x-\\frac12\\right)^2 dx$$ then obtain a closed form of $I$. Convergence is ensured by the fact that $x \\mapsto  f(x)=\\left( \\frac1{\\log(x+1)-\\log x}-x-\\frac12\\right)^2$ is continuous on $(0,+\\infty)$ with $f(x) \\sim \\dfrac14$ as $x \\to 0^+$ and $f(x) \\sim \\dfrac1{144 x^2}$ as $x \\to +\\infty.$ I did not succeed in finding a closed form of $I$. My attempt was to consider a certain parameter integral then make some differentiation to get rid of the $\\log$ terms...",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here is an alternate solution: We introduce $$ I(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{1}{e^x - 1} + \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{x}\\right)^2 \\frac{x^s e^x}{(e^x - 1)^2} \\, dx. $$ It is easy to check $I = I(0)$ and $I(s)$ is analytic for $\\Re(s) > -1$. We can also check that \\begin{align*}\nJ(n, s)\n&:= \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^{s-1}e^x}{(e^x - 1)^{n+1}} \\, dx\n = \\sum_{k=n}^{\\infty} \\binom{k}{n} \\frac{\\Gamma(s)}{k^s} \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\Gamma(s)}{n!} \\sum_{j=0}^{n} (-1)^{n-j} \\left[{n \\atop j}\\right] \\zeta(s-j), \\tag{1}\n\\end{align*} where $\\left[{n \\atop j}\\right]$ denotes the Stirling's number of the first kind. Using this, if $\\Re(s)$ is large, then we find that \\begin{align*}\nI(s) &= J(3, s+1) + J(2,s+1) + \\tfrac{1}{4}J(1, s+1) \\\\\n&\\qquad - 2J(2, s) - J(1, s) + J(1, s-1). \\tag{2}\n\\end{align*} Plugging (1) to this equation and using the principle of analytic continuation, we check that the resulting expression is still valid near $s = 0$. Simplifying (2), we get $$ I(s) = \\left( \\frac{\\Gamma(s+1)}{6} - \\Gamma(s) + \\Gamma(s-1) \\right)\\zeta(s-2) + \\frac{1}{12}\\Gamma(s+1)\\zeta(s) $$ and taking $s \\to 0$ we have $$ I(0) = -2\\zeta'(-2) + \\frac{1}{12}\\zeta(0) = \\frac{\\zeta(3)}{2\\pi^2} - \\frac{1}{24}. $$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to read the original problem carefully and extract the necessary information.\n\nThe problem is about proving the convergence of an integral and finding its closed form. The integral is from 0 to infinity of the square of a function involving the reciprocal of the logarithm difference between x+1 and x, minus x minus 1/2. \n\nThe original question mentions that convergence is ensured because the function is continuous on (0, infinity) and behaves like 1/4 near zero and like 1/(144x²) at infinity. These are key points for the assumptions. The user also mentions their attempt with a parameter integral and differentiation, but that's part of their attempt, not the problem's conditions.\n\nSo, the assumptions should include the continuity of the function on the interval, its behavior as x approaches 0+, and its behavior as x approaches infinity. Each of these is a separate condition applied to the function f(x). The problem statement then is to prove convergence and find the closed form of the integral I.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is a single line addressing one property. Let me list them:\n\n1. The function f(x) = [1/(log(x+1) - log x) - x - 1/2]^2 is continuous on (0, +∞).\n2. As x approaches 0+, f(x) is asymptotic to 1/4.\n3. As x approaches +∞, f(x) is asymptotic to 1/(144x²).\n\nThese three assumptions support the convergence and the form of the integral. The problem is to prove convergence and find the closed form of I. I should present this in the required format without any extra information from the user's attempt.",
