    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem step by step. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions and the main problem statement.\n\nThe original question is about a function f that's twice continuously differentiable on the interval [0,1], mapping to [0,1]. The conditions given are f(0) = 0, f'(0) = 0, f'(1) = 0, and f(1) = 1. The goal is to prove that the maximum absolute value of the second derivative on [0,1] is at least 4.\n\nSo, the assumptions should list each condition separately. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The function f belongs to C²([0,1], [0,1]). That means f is twice continuously differentiable, and its codomain is [0,1].\n2. f(0) = 0. That's a specific value at 0.\n3. f'(0) = 0. The first derivative at 0 is zero.\n4. f'(1) = 0. Similarly, the first derivative at 1 is zero.\n5. f(1) = 1. The function value at 1 is one.\n\nThese are all individual conditions applied to f. The problem statement is to prove that the maximum of |f''| on [0,1] is at least 4.\n\nWait, in the example provided, the user included some assumptions from the problem that weren't explicitly stated, like \"n is divisible by 7\". But in this case, all the conditions are given explicitly in the problem. The original problem didn't mention anything else, so maybe all the assumptions are listed in the question.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is a single line, addressing one property or condition. So each of the four function conditions (f(0), f'(0), f'(1), f(1)) and the function's class (C²) should be separate.\n\nAlso, the function's codomain is [0,1], so that's another condition. Wait, the problem states \"f∈C²([0,1], [0,1])\", which means f maps [0,1] to [0,1]. So that's part of the assumption about the function's domain and codomain.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- f is a function in C²([0,1], [0,1]).\n- f(0) = 0.\n- f’(0) = 0.\n- f’(1) = 0.\n- f(1) = 1.\n\nEach of these is a separate line. The problem is to prove that the maximum of |f''| over [0,1] is at least 4.\n\nI need to check if there are any other implicit assumptions. The problem mentions \"f∈C²([0,1], [0,1])\", which includes continuity of f'' since C² means twice continuously differentiable. So the continuity of f'' is already covered by the C² assumption. The user's progress mentions using the continuity of f'' later, but in the problem statement, it's part of the given.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have each of those five points as separate assumptions, and the problem statement as given. The original example had assumptions split into individual properties, so here each condition (function class, each boundary condition) is separate.",
