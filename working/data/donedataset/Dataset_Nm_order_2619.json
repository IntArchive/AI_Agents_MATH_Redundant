    "Content": "I am currently studying for my Algebra Qualifying Exam. I came across the following problem and am stuck on where to even begin: Prove that $x^5-2$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Z}_{31}$. I have found a similar question with $x^3-9;$ however, with degree $5$, proving there is no linear factor does not prove that $x^5-2$ is irreducible. Any hints or helpful insight would be nice. Thanks!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The OP previously verified that $x^5 - 2$ has no root in $\\mathbb{Z}_{31}$, equiv. no linear factor. Lubin's Answer contains the key observation that any root $\\alpha$ of $x^5 - 2$ in a field extension of $\\mathbb{Z}_{31}$ would be a twenty-fifth root of unity, since $2$ is already a fifth root of unity in $\\mathbb{Z}_{31}$. Indeed $\\mathbb{Z}_{31}$ contains the five roots of $x^5-1$, namely $1,2,4,8,16$, as many as a field can have for a fifth degree polynomial (by Fund. Thm. of Algebra). The OP has puzzled out an argument to finish this Qualifying Exam problem based on the order of the multiplicative group of any quadratic field extension. If $\\alpha$ satisfied a quadratic irreducible factor of $x^5 - 2$, say polynomial $p(x)$, then the simple field extension $\\mathbb{Z}_{31}(\\alpha)$ would have dimension two over $\\mathbb{Z}_{31}$ as a vector space and contain $961 = 31^2$ elements. The nonzero elements of this field extension are units and form a multiplicative group of order one less (omitting zero), $960$. But the multiplicative order of $\\alpha$ is $25$, just restating that it is a twenty-fifth root of unity but not a fifth root of unity.  But if $\\alpha$ is in the multiplicative group of order $960$, a consequence of Lagrange's Thm. is that $25$ divides $960$. Since that just isn't true, $x^5 - 2$ has no quadratic irreducible factors over $\\mathbb{Z}_{31}$.  By eliminating any linear and quadratic factors of $x^5 -2$ we conclude this fifth degree polynomial is irreducible (if it factored, one factor would necessarily have degree two or less).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem: Prove that \\( x^5 - 2 \\) is irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{31} \\). Hmm, first, I need to recall some methods for proving irreducibility of polynomials over finite fields. Since the user mentioned that checking for linear factors isn't enough here because the polynomial is of degree 5, which is prime, but even if there are no linear factors, it could still factor into a quadratic and a cubic, for example. So, maybe I need to use a different approach.\n\nFirst, let's note the assumptions. The problem states the polynomial \\( x^5 - 2 \\) and the field \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{31} \\). The key points here are:\n\n1. The polynomial in question is \\( x^5 - 2 \\).\n2. The coefficients are in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{31} \\), which is the finite field with 31 elements.\n3. We need to prove irreducibility over this field.\n\nWait, the original problem didn't mention any specific conditions on the polynomial other than being \\( x^5 - 2 \\), so maybe the assumptions are straightforward. Let me check the example given in the user's instruction. The example had assumptions listed as the integer n and that n is divisible by 7. But in the problem here, there's no such condition given. Wait, the problem is to prove irreducibility over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{31} \\), so maybe the assumptions are just that we're working in that field. But perhaps the user wants to extract all implicit assumptions from the problem. Let me think.\n\nThe problem states \"Prove \\( x^5 - 2 \\) is irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{31} \\).\" So the assumptions would be:\n\n- The polynomial is \\( x^5 - 2 \\).\n- The coefficients are considered in the ring \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{31} \\), which is a field because 31 is prime.\n- The polynomial is in one variable x.\n- The question is about irreducibility, meaning it cannot be factored into the product of two non-constant polynomials with coefficients in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{31} \\).\n\nBut according to the example, assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- The polynomial is \\( x^5 - 2 \\).\n- The polynomial is considered over the field \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{31} \\).\n\nBut maybe more precise. Wait, in the example, the user had listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, perhaps the polynomial's coefficients are in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{31} \\), and the polynomial is monic, etc. But maybe the problem as stated doesn't have additional assumptions; the problem is to prove irreducibility under the given conditions. Therefore, the main assumptions are that we're working over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{31} \\), and the polynomial is \\( x^5 - 2 \\). Let me check if there are any other implicit assumptions. For instance, 31 is a prime, so \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{31} \\) is indeed a field. The polynomial is of degree 5, which is prime, but that's part of the problem statement rather than an assumption. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is exactly as stated, so the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\n- The polynomial \\( x^5 - 2 \\) is considered over the field \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{31} \\).\n\nBut the example had two assumptions, even though in the original problem there was only one. Wait, in the example, the original problem was that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The user formatted it with two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7. Wait, wait, maybe that was a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the original example says: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem lists assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" But that seems incorrect because in the original problem, the statement is \"for every integer n\", so the assumption shouldn't include \"n is divisible by 7\". That must be a mistake in the example. So perhaps the user made an error there. Therefore, in our problem, we should list all the given conditions as assumptions.\n\nBut in our problem, the problem is simply to prove that \\( x^5 -2 \\) is irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{31} \\). So the only assumptions are:\n\n- The polynomial is \\( x^5 - 2 \\).\n- The polynomial is considered over the field \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{31} \\).\n\nBut since the problem is to prove irreducibility, maybe there's more. Wait, perhaps we need to note that \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{31} \\) is a finite field of order 31, which is prime, so that's part of the context. But I think in the example, the user included the divisibility condition even though it wasn't stated, so perhaps the example is not a good model. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n. Then the formatted problem incorrectly added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That's a mistake. Therefore, I should follow the correct approach here.\n\nSo, the problem is as stated. The assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The polynomial is \\( x^5 - 2 \\).\n- The polynomial is considered over the field \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{31} \\).\n\nBut since \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{31} \\) is a field, and the polynomial is monic, etc. But maybe those are properties, not assumptions. The problem doesn't state any conditions beyond that. Therefore, the correct assumptions are just the polynomial and the field.\n\nBut to make sure, let's look at the problem again: \"Prove that \\( x^5 -2 \\) is irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{31} \\).\" So the problem is to show that this polynomial cannot be factored into lower-degree polynomials over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{31} \\). So the assumptions are inherent: the polynomial is as given, over that field.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list:\n\nAssumption:\n- The polynomial is \\( x^5 - 2 \\).\n- The polynomial is considered over the field \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{31} \\).\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address one property applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- \\( x^5 - 2 \\) is a polynomial over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{31} \\).\n\nBut maybe split into two:\n\n- The base ring is \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{31} \\).\n- The polynomial is \\( x^5 - 2 \\).\n\nBut the problem is about the polynomial over that ring, so maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n- Consider the polynomial \\( x^5 - 2 \\).\n- The coefficients are in the field \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{31} \\).\n\nAlternatively, since the field is part of the problem statement, perhaps the first assumption is that the polynomial is in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{31}[x] \\), and the second is the specific form \\( x^5 - 2 \\). But the problem is to prove irreducibility over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{31} \\), so the main assumption is that we're working over that field. Therefore, the correct way is:\n\nAssumption:\n- \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{31} \\) is a field.\n- The polynomial is \\( x^5 - 2 \\).\n\nBut wait, \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{31} \\) is a field because 31 is prime, but that's a given fact, not an assumption of the problem. The problem just states to work over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{31} \\), so the assumption is that the polynomial is considered over that field. Therefore, the assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The polynomial \\( x^5 - 2 \\) is in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{31}[x] \\).\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption is a separate line. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n- The polynomial is \\( x^5 - 2 \\).\n- The polynomial is considered over the field \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{31} \\).\n\nYes, that seems right. Each line addresses one property applied to one object. The first line is about the polynomial's form, the second about the field it's over.\n\nNow, the problem statement is \"Prove that \\( x^5 -2 \\) is irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{31} \\).\"\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption:\nThe polynomial is \\( x^5 - 2 \\),\nThe polynomial is considered over the field \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{31} \\).\nProblem:\nProve that \\( x^5 - 2 \\) is irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{31} \\).",
