    "Content": "Prove that each irreducible factor of $f(x)=x^{2^n}+x+1$ in $\\mathbb Z_2[x]$ has degree $k$, where $k\\mid 2n$. Edit. I know I should somehow relate the question to an extension of $\\mathbb Z_2$ of degree $2n$, say $GF(2^{2n})$. By this way I will be able to correspond each irreducible factor of $f(x)$ to a subfield of $GF(2^{2n})$ that obviously has degree $k$, where $k\\mid 2n$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $p(x)\\mid x^{2^n}+x+1$, $p$ irreducible, and $a\\in\\overline{\\Bbb F}_2$ a root of $f$. Then $a^{2^n}+a+1=0$, equivalently $a^{2^n}=a+1$. It follows that $a^{2^{2n}}=a$, so $\\Bbb F_2(a)\\subset\\Bbb F_{2^{2n}}$. This shows that $\\deg p\\mid 2n$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about proving that each irreducible factor of the polynomial f(x) = x^{2^n} + x + 1 in ℤ₂[x] has a degree k that divides 2n. The user mentions relating this to an extension field GF(2^{2n}) and connecting irreducible factors to subfields.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem is in ℤ₂[x], so the polynomial is over the field of two elements. The polynomial given is f(x) = x^{2^n} + x + 1. The main object here is this polynomial, and the conditions are about its irreducible factors. The goal is to show each irreducible factor has degree k where k divides 2n.\n\nLooking at the example provided, assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So for this problem, the assumptions should include:\n\n- The polynomial is f(x) = x^{2^n} + x + 1.\n- The polynomial is considered in the ring ℤ₂[x] (the coefficients are modulo 2).\n- The factors in question are irreducible in ℤ₂[x].\n- The problem involves the degrees of these irreducible factors needing to divide 2n.\n\nWait, but the problem statement itself is to prove that each irreducible factor's degree k divides 2n. So the assumptions should include the context in which the problem is set, not the conclusion. The user's edit mentions using the extension field GF(2^{2n}), so maybe that's part of their approach, but not an assumption of the problem itself. The original problem doesn't state that n has any specific properties beyond being an exponent in the polynomial. However, in the example given, there was an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the original problem's statement. Wait, looking back, the original example had \"for every integer n\" but in the formatted problem, they included \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, no, in the original example, the user wrote:\n\nOriginal problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like a mistake. Wait, no, let me check again. The original problem said \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, the assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, that seems conflicting. But maybe the original problem had a typo or maybe the example was incorrect. Wait, perhaps the example was a different problem. Hmm, maybe the example is from another problem. Well, regardless, the key is that the assumptions should list all the given conditions from the problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the user says \"Prove that each irreducible factor of f(x)=x^{2^n}+x+1 in ℤ₂[x] has degree k, where k∣2n.\" So the assumptions here would be:\n\n- f(x) = x^{2^n} + x + 1 is a polynomial in ℤ₂[x].\n- We are considering its irreducible factors in ℤ₂[x].\n- The variable n is an integer (since 2^n is part of the exponent).\n\nBut the problem doesn't state any restrictions on n, so maybe the only assumption is that f(x) is as defined in ℤ₂[x], and the problem is to show that each irreducible factor's degree divides 2n. Wait, but in the example, they included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. So perhaps here, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The polynomial f(x) = x^{2^n} + x + 1 is in ℤ₂[x].\n- The factors considered are irreducible in ℤ₂[x].\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify any conditions on n other than it being part of the exponent. The user mentions relating to GF(2^{2n}), which suggests that maybe n is a positive integer, but unless specified, perhaps we don't need to assume that. However, in polynomial exponents, typically n would be a non-negative integer. But since the problem states \"for each irreducible factor,\" perhaps the main assumptions are about the polynomial and the field.\n\nWait, maybe the problem as stated doesn't have additional assumptions beyond the polynomial being in ℤ₂[x]. The user is asking to prove a property about its irreducible factors. So perhaps the formatted problem would list:\n\nAssumptions:\nf(x) = x^{2^n} + x + 1 is in ℤ₂[x],\nWe consider irreducible factors of f(x) in ℤ₂[x].\n\nProblem:\nProve that each irreducible factor has degree k where k divides 2n.\n\nBut the example given had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. So each assumption is a separate line. Here, the polynomial is in ℤ₂[x], which is one assumption, and perhaps that the polynomial is of the form x^{2^n} + x + 1, which is another. Also, considering irreducible factors. Wait, but \"irreducible factors\" is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. The problem is to prove that each irreducible factor has a certain degree. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The polynomial f(x) = x^{2^n} + x + 1 is in ℤ₂[x].\n- n is an integer.\n\nBut maybe n is a positive integer? Because 2^n is typically for n ≥ 0. But the original problem doesn't specify, so maybe we shouldn't assume that unless necessary. The problem might hold for any integer n, but realistically, exponents are non-negative. However, the problem states \"each irreducible factor,\" so perhaps the polynomial is considered for n being a non-negative integer, but the problem statement doesn't specify. Since the example included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, perhaps here we should also list that n is an integer. However, in the original problem statement, the user didn't specify any constraints on n, so maybe that's part of the problem's generality. But the answer's assumptions need to list all the given conditions. Since the problem is to prove for the polynomial x^{2^n} + x + 1 in ℤ₂[x], the assumptions are:\n\n1. f(x) = x^{2^n} + x + 1 is an element of ℤ₂[x].\n2. The polynomial f(x) is factored into irreducible factors in ℤ₂[x].\n\nBut the second point is part of the problem's context, not an assumption. Wait, the problem is about the irreducible factors of f(x), so the existence of such factors is given by the fundamental theorem of algebra, but in the context of finite fields, every polynomial factors into irreducibles. So maybe the only explicit assumptions are:\n\n- f(x) = x^{2^n} + x + 1 is in ℤ₂[x].\n- The problem concerns irreducible factors of f(x) in ℤ₂[x].\n\nBut perhaps the key assumptions are the field being ℤ₂ and the form of the polynomial. The user also mentions relating to GF(2^{2n}), which is an extension field of degree 2n over ℤ₂. So maybe another assumption is that the splitting field of f(x) is GF(2^{2n}), but that's part of the solution approach, not the problem's assumptions.\n\nTherefore, structuring the problem as per the example, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) = x^{2^n} + x + 1 is in ℤ₂[x],\nEach irreducible factor of f(x) is considered in ℤ₂[x].\n\nProblem:\nProve that each irreducible factor has degree k where k divides 2n.\n\nWait, but the second assumption is redundant because the problem is about factors in ℤ₂[x]. So maybe just:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) = x^{2^n} + x + 1 is in ℤ₂[x].\n\nProblem:\nProve that each irreducible factor of f(x) in ℤ₂[x] has degree k where k divides 2n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement includes that we are to consider irreducible factors in ℤ₂[x], so the assumption is the polynomial is in that ring, and the problem is to prove about those factors. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but in this case, the key assumption is the polynomial's definition and the field. So I think the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) = x^{2^n} + x + 1 is a polynomial in ℤ₂[x].\n\nProblem:\nProve that each irreducible factor of f(x) in ℤ₂[x] has degree k, where k divides 2n.\n\nThis seems to capture the necessary elements. The user's edit mentions using GF(2^{2n}), which might be part of the solution method, but isn't an assumption of the problem itself. So the formatted problem should list the polynomial and the field as the main assumptions.",
