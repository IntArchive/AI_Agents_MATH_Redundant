    "Content": "Prove that for any set of $2n+3$ integers from the interval $[-2n-1,2n+1]$ there is a triple $(x,y,z)$ such that $x+y+z=0$. Example  : Choose $5$ number from $\\{-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3\\}$ there are $x,y,z$ with $x+y+z=0$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here is the proof several cases, though Case 0 is trivial, Case 1 and Case 3 are similar to each other, and Case 2 and Case 4 are also similar to each other (so we might say that there are only two important cases). Case 0. If $0$ is among the chosen numbers, then use that there is non-zero $x$ with both $x$ and $-x$ among the chosen numbers, so then the sum $x+(-x)+0=0$ works. Such an $x$ exists since otherwise the absolute value function would be an injective map from the set of $(2n+2)$-many non-zero chosen numbers into the interval $[1,..,2n+1]$ which is impossible. In all remaining cases, I will assume that $0$ is not chosen. Case 1. Neither $-2n-1$ nor $2n+1$ are among the chosen numbers. \nThen we could also remove $\\pm 2n$, thus removing at most two chosen numbers, and restrict our attention to the interval $[−2n+1,..,2n−1]=[−2(n−1)−1,..,2(n−1)+1]$, and in it we have at least $2n+3−2=2(n−1)+3$ chosen numbers, and apply induction hypothesis (where the context of a proof by induction ought to be clear, the base case being $n=0$, choosing three integers from the interval $[-1,0,1]$, then clearly the choice is unique and $-1+0+1=0$). We are done in this case too. So we may assume without loss of generality that either $-2n-1$,or $2n+1$, or both are among the chosen numbers. After replacing each number with its opposite (if necessary) we may assume (in all remaining cases) that $2n+1$ is one of the chosen numbers. Case 2. Both $-2n-1$ and $2n+1$ are among the chosen numbers. It is better to illustrate this case with an example first. Say $n=3$ so we consider the interval $[-7,..,7]$ and both $-7$ and $7$ are among the chosen numbers. \nThen (assuming the statement we are trying to prove were false) it is not possible that both $-6$ and $-1$ are chosen (since then $-6+(-1)+7=0$). More generally there could be at most one chosen number in each pair $\\{-6,-1\\}$, \n$\\{-5,-2\\}$, $\\{-4,-3\\}$, $\\{3,4\\}$, $\\{2,5\\}$, $\\{1,6\\}$. Thus, there could be at most three chosen numbers in $[-6,..,-1]$ and at most three in $[1,..,6]$, \nand these numbers together with $-7$ and $7$ make at most $8$ chosen numbers, but the chosen numbers were supposed to be $2n+3=9$, a contradiction. Clearly this works in general: If both $-2n-1$ and $2n+1$ are among the chosen numbers then there are at most $n$-many chosen numbers in $[-2n,..,-1]$, at most $n$-many in $[1,..,2n]$, and this would make at most $2n+2$ total, a contradiction. So, in all remaining cases we may assume that $2n+1$ is chosen, but $-2n-1$ is not. Case 3. At most one of the numbers $-2n$ and $2n$ is chosen. This is treated very much like Case 1: Restricting our attention to the interval $[−2(n−1)−1,..,2(n−1)+1]$, where we have at least $2(n−1)+3$ chosen numbers, and apply induction hypothesis. Case 4. Both $-2n$ and $2n$ are chosen. This is treated similar to Case 2. So, $2n+1$ and $\\pm 2n$ are chosen. The number $n$ may be chosen. At most $n$-many numbers in $[-2n,..,-1]$ may be chosen, and this includes the chosen number $-2n$. At most $(n-1)$-many numbers may be chosen in $[1,..,n-1]\\cup[n+1,..,2n-1]$. This makes total of at most $3+1+n-1+n-1=(2n+2)$-many numbers, a contradiction, which completes the proof. (The last count one more time in a slightly different manner: The numbers $2n+1$ and $2n$ are chosen, and $n$ may be chosen. Then at most $n$-many in $[-2n,..,-1]$ (including the number $-2n$) and at most $(n-1)$-many in $[1,..,n-1]\\cup[n+1,..,2n-1]$, this makes $3+n+n-1=2n+2$ numbers at most.) Note. The assumption that the endpoints are odd is important. Indeed we may pick four numbers $\\{-2,-1,1,2\\}$ in $[-2,..,2]$ with no triple among them that sums up to $0$. Similarly we may pick six numbers $\\{-4,-3,-2,2,3,4\\}$ in $[-4,..,4]$ with no zero-sum triple. This seems to generalize, $[-2n,..,-n]\\cup[n,..,2n]$ are $(2n+2)$-many numbers in $[-2n,..,2n]$ with no zero-sum triple.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to read and understand the original problem carefully.\n\nThe problem states: Prove that for any set of \\(2n+3\\) integers chosen from the interval \\([-2n-1, 2n+1]\\), there exists a triple \\((x, y, z)\\) such that \\(x + y + z = 0\\). The example given is selecting 5 numbers from \\(\\{-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3\\}\\) and ensuring a zero-sum triple.\n\nMy task is to list the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object, and then state the problem concisely.\n\nFirst, identify the assumptions. The original problem mentions a set of \\(2n+3\\) integers. The interval from which these integers are chosen is \\([-2n-1, 2n+1]\\). The goal is to show there's a triple summing to zero. \n\nSo, the first assumption is about the number of integers selected: the set has \\(2n+3\\) integers. The second assumption is about the range of these integers: they are within the interval \\([-2n-1, 2n+1]\\). The problem is to prove the existence of a zero-sum triple.\n\nWait, the original example uses \\(n=1\\) (since 2n+3=5 when n=1, and the interval is [-3,3]). The problem seems to generalize this example for any integer \\(n\\). So, the assumptions should include that the integers are selected from that specific interval and the size of the set is \\(2n+3\\). \n\nAre there any other implicit assumptions? For instance, are the integers distinct? The problem says \"any set\", which typically allows for possible duplicates unless specified otherwise. But in the context of sets, elements are unique. Wait, the problem says \"integers from the interval\", not necessarily distinct. But in mathematics, a set cannot have duplicate elements. So, the set has distinct integers. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. The set consists of \\(2n+3\\) integers.\n2. Each integer in the set is within the interval \\([-2n-1, 2n+1]\\).\n\nThe problem is to prove that there exists a triple within this set that sums to zero.\n\nSo, formatting this:\n\nAssumption: \n- The set contains \\(2n + 3\\) integers,\n- Each integer in the set is selected from the interval \\([-2n - 1, 2n + 1]\\).\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists a triple \\((x, y, z)\\) such that \\(x + y + z = 0\\).\n\nBut let me check the example given. The example takes 5 numbers from \\(-3\\) to \\(3\\), which fits when \\(n=1\\). The answer's format example had two assumptions: one about \\(n\\) being an integer and another about divisibility. However, in the current problem, the original problem doesn't state any restriction on \\(n\\) except that it's part of defining the interval and the size of the set. So, perhaps \\(n\\) is a positive integer? The problem doesn't specify, but since the interval is defined with \\(2n+1\\), \\(n\\) must be a non-negative integer. However, when \\(n=0\\), the interval would be \\([-1,1]\\), and the set size would be 3. Then, selecting 3 numbers from \\(-1, 0, 1\\) must have a triple summing to zero. But in that case, the set could be \\(\\{-1, 0, 1\\}\\), which sums to zero. Or if it's allowed to pick duplicates? Wait, no, because it's a set. So, even for \\(n=0\\), the problem holds. However, the original example uses \\(n=1\\), so maybe \\(n\\) is a positive integer. But the problem says \"for any set of \\(2n+3\\) integers\", so perhaps \\(n\\) is an integer such that \\(2n+3\\) is valid. However, the problem as stated doesn't restrict \\(n\\); it's part of the general statement. Therefore, the assumptions should include that \\(n\\) is an integer. Wait, in the original example, the problem didn't specify that \\(n\\) is an integer, but the way it's written implies \\(n\\) is a non-negative integer. So, perhaps one assumption is that \\(n\\) is a non-negative integer. But the user's example had an assumption that \\(n\\) is an integer and divisible by 7, but in this case, the problem doesn't state such a condition. Wait, the user's example was different. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem in the example: Prove that for every integer \\(n\\), the number \\(A(n)\\) is divisible by 91. The formatted assumption was that \\(n\\) is an integer and divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem states \"for every integer \\(n\\)\", but the formatted assumption adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems conflicting. Wait, maybe that example was incorrect? Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in their example. Wait, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer \\(n\\), the number \\(A(n)\\) is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted assumption lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But that would restrict n to multiples of 7, whereas the original problem says for every integer n. Hmm, that seems contradictory. Maybe the user's example is incorrect, but perhaps that's how they wanted the format, even if the original problem doesn't have the assumption. So, perhaps the user's example is wrong, but we have to follow their structure regardless.\n\nBut in the current problem, the original question says \"for any set of \\(2n+3\\) integers from the interval \\([-2n-1,2n+1]\\)\". So, the variables here are the set and the integer \\(n\\). The problem is to prove that regardless of the chosen set (with the given size and interval), there's a zero-sum triple.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. \\(n\\) is an integer (probably non-negative, but the problem doesn't specify, so just integer)\n2. A set of \\(2n+3\\) integers is chosen.\n3. Each integer in the set is within the interval \\([-2n-1, 2n+1]\\).\n\nBut the problem doesn't state any restrictions on \\(n\\) other than those implied by the interval and set size. For example, if \\(n\\) is a negative integer, the interval might not make sense. For instance, if \\(n = -1\\), then the interval would be \\([-2(-1)-1, 2(-1)+1] = [1, -1]\\), which is invalid. Therefore, \\(n\\) must be a non-negative integer. So perhaps that's an implicit assumption. However, the problem as stated doesn't specify, so should we include it?\n\nBut according to the user's example, they included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. For example, in the original problem, the example was \"Prove that for every integer \\(n\\)...\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the user's example is flawed, and maybe they intended for the assumptions to be those explicitly given in the problem. Wait, maybe there was a mistake in their example. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer \\(n\\), the number \\(A(n)\\) is divisible by 91. The formatted assumption is: $n$ is an integer, $n$ is divisible by 7. But this contradicts the original problem's \"for every integer n\". Therefore, that might be an error. Perhaps the original problem in the example had a different condition, like n divisible by 7, and the user made a typo. Alternatively, maybe the example is incorrect, but regardless, we need to follow the format as per the user's instruction.\n\nBut in our current problem, the original problem states \"for any set of \\(2n+3\\) integers from the interval \\([-2n-1,2n+1]\\)\". Therefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n- The set has \\(2n+3\\) integers.\n- Each integer in the set is in the interval \\([-2n-1, 2n+1]\\).\n\nBut the variable \\(n\\) here is part of the problem's parameters. Since the problem says \"for any set\", the variable \\(n\\) is given, and the conditions depend on \\(n\\). Therefore, the problem assumes \\(n\\) is such that the interval is valid. Since the interval \\([-2n-1, 2n+1]\\) must be valid, \\(2n+1\\) must be greater than or equal to \\(-2n-1\\). Solving \\(2n+1 \\geq -2n-1\\) gives \\(4n \\geq -2\\), so \\(n \\geq -0.5\\). Since \\(n\\) is an integer (because the set size is \\(2n+3\\), which must be a positive integer), \\(n\\) must be a non-negative integer (since for \\(n=-1\\), set size would be 1, but interval would be invalid). Therefore, implicitly, \\(n\\) is a non-negative integer. However, the problem doesn't state this explicitly. Therefore, do we include it as an assumption?\n\nIn the user's example, they included \"n is an integer\" even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So perhaps, per the user's example, even if the problem states \"for any integer n\", we list it as an assumption. Therefore, following the user's example, even if the original problem mentions that \\(n\\) is an integer, we list it as an assumption. But in our current problem, the original problem does not explicitly state that \\(n\\) is an integer. Wait, the problem says \"any set of \\(2n+3\\) integers\". Here, \\(2n+3\\) must be an integer, so \\(n\\) must be an integer. Therefore, the problem implicitly requires \\(n\\) to be an integer. Therefore, the first assumption is that \\(n\\) is an integer. Then, the set size is \\(2n+3\\), and the interval is \\([-2n-1, 2n+1]\\).\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- \\(n\\) is an integer.\n- The set contains \\(2n + 3\\) integers.\n- Each integer in the set is selected from the interval \\([-2n - 1, 2n + 1]\\).\n\nThe problem is to prove that there exists a triple \\((x, y, z)\\) in the set such that \\(x + y + z = 0\\).\n\nThis seems correct. Each assumption is on a separate line, addressing one condition. The first addresses \\(n\\) being an integer, the second the size of the set, and the third the range of the integers. The problem is then stated concisely.\n\nChecking against the user's example, even though their example might have included an incorrect assumption (adding divisibility by 7 where the original problem didn't), we must follow the structure. In our case, all the assumptions are correctly extracted from the problem statement.",
