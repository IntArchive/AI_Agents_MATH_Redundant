    "Content": "This exercise appears in Section 6.B \"Orthonormal Bases\" in Linear Algebra Done Right by Sheldon Axler.  Inner product spaces, norms, orthogonality, and orthonormal bases have been introduced. The unofficial solution manual I am using presents a somewhat involved proof of this exercise that involves induction and the Gram-Schmidt procedure, which I will not reproduce here.  However, I arrived at an alternative proof that is much simpler in my opinion.  I would like to check if my proof is correct. $(V, \\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle)$ is an inner product space over the field $\\mathbb{F}$ , which stands for either $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$ .  (Axler, pp. 4, 167) Suppose $v_1, \\dotsc, v_m$ is a linearly independent list in $V$ .  Show that there exists $w \\in V$ such that $\\langle w, v_j \\rangle > 0$ for all $j \\in \\{1, \\dotsc, m\\}$ .  (Axler, p. 191) Proof.  Let $U = \\operatorname{span}(v_1, \\dotsc, v_m)$ .  Consider the linear map $\\phi : U \\to \\mathbb{F}^m$ defined by $$\n\\phi(u) = (\\langle u, v_1 \\rangle, \\dotsc, \\langle u, v_m \\rangle).\n$$ We show that $\\phi$ is injective.  Suppose that $u \\in U$ and $\\phi(u) = 0$ .  Then, $$\n\\langle u, v_1 \\rangle = \\dotsb = \\langle u, v_m \\rangle = 0.\n$$ Since $u \\in \\operatorname{span}(v_1, \\dotsc, v_m)$ ,\nwe have $\\langle u, u \\rangle = 0$ , so $u = 0$ .  Hence, $\\phi$ is injective.  But $\\dim U = \\dim \\mathbb{F}^m = m$ , so $\\phi$ is surjective.  Choose $w \\in U$ such that $$\n\\phi(w) = (1, \\dotsc, 1).\n$$ Therefore, $\\langle w, v_j \\rangle = 1 > 0$ for all $j \\in \\{1, \\dotsc, m\\}$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. So, the user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that I need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object. Then, the problem statement itself.\n\nFirst, I need to read through the original problem carefully. The question is from Axler's Linear Algebra Done Right, Exercise 6.B.13. The problem states that given a linearly independent list of vectors in an inner product space, we need to show there exists a vector w such that the inner product of w with each v_j is positive.\n\nLooking at the assumptions: The inner product space is over F, which is either R or C. The list v1,...,vm is linearly independent in V. The problem is in the context of orthonormal bases, norms, etc. But in the original problem statement, the user mentions that they have a proof involving injectivity of a map phi and surjectivity leading to the existence of w.\n\nWait, but when structuring the problem, we need to filter out any solutions or proof attempts. The original question is just the problem statement from Axler's book. The user's own proof attempt is part of their question, but for the formatted problem, we should focus only on the problem as posed, not the user's solution.\n\nSo the key assumptions here are:\n\n1. V is an inner product space over F (either R or C).\n2. v1, ..., vm is a linearly independent list in V.\n\nThe problem is to show there exists a w in V such that <w, v_j> > 0 for all j from 1 to m.\n\nWait, but the original problem statement in the user's post says \"Suppose v_1, ..., v_m is a linearly independent list in V. Show that there exists w ∈ V such that ⟨w, v_j⟩ > 0 for all j ∈ {1, ..., m}.\" So the assumptions are the inner product space structure, the linear independence of the list, and the rest is part of the problem.\n\nIn the example given, the assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So each assumption is a single condition applied to one object. Here, the inner product space is over F (either real or complex), and the list is linearly independent.\n\nSo structuring the assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\nV is an inner product space over F,\nF is either the real numbers or the complex numbers,\nv_1, ..., v_m is a linearly independent list in V.\n\nThen the problem is to show that there exists a w in V with those inner products positive.\n\nBut wait, in the example, each assumption is a separate line. Let's check the example again. The example had:\n\nAssumption:\n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nSo each line is a separate assumption. So for this problem:\n\nAssumption:\nV is an inner product space over F,\nF is either ℝ or ℂ,\nv₁, …, vₘ is a linearly independent list in V.\n\nProblem: Show that there exists w ∈ V such that ⟨w, vⱼ⟩ > 0 for all j ∈ {1, …, m}.\n\nBut wait, the original problem statement mentions that the exercise is in the section on orthonormal bases, but that's part of the context. The user also mentions the solution manual's approach and their own proof, but those are not part of the problem's assumptions. The key assumptions are the ones given in the problem statement: inner product space over F (real or complex), and the linear independence of the list.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list those as assumptions. Each assumption line by line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nV is an inner product space over 𝔽,\n𝔽 is either ℝ or ℂ,\nv₁, …, vₘ is a linearly independent list in V.\n\nProblem: Show that there exists w ∈ V such that ⟨w, vⱼ⟩ > 0 for all j ∈ {1, …, m}.\n\nYes, that seems right. Each assumption is one condition. The first line states V is an inner product space over F. Second line specifies F is R or C. Third line states the list is linearly independent. Then the problem is to show the existence of w.",
