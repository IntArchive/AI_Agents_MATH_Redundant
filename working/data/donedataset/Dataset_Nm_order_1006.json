    "Content": "The most relative that I found on Google for de morgan's 3 variable was: (ABC)' = A' + B' + C'. I didn't find the answer for my question, therefore I'll ask here: What is De-Morgan's theorem for (A + B + C)' ?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "DeMorgan's Theorem applied to $(A + B + C)'$ is as follows: $$(A + B + C)' = A'B'C'{}{}{}{}$$ We have $\\;\\;$NOT(A or B or C) $\\;\\equiv\\;$ Not(A) and Not(B) and Not(C), which in boolean-algebra equates to $A'B'C'$ Both these extensions from DeMorgan's defined for two variables can be justified precisely because we can apply DeMorgan's in a nested manner, and in so doing, reapply, etc, in the end, it is equivalent to an immediate extension of it's application to three variables (or more) variables, provided they are connected by the same connective, $\\land, \\lor$. For example, we can write $(A+B+C)' \\equiv \\big(A + (B+C)\\big)' \\equiv \\big(A' \\cdot (B+C)'\\big) \\equiv A'\\cdot (B'C') \\equiv A'B'C'$. Indeed, provided we have a negated series of multiple variables all connected by the SAME connective (all and'ed or all or'ed), we can generalize DeMorgan's to even more than three variables, again, due to the associativity of AND and OR connectives. For any  arbitrary finite number of connected variables: So, $$(ABCDEFGHIJ)' = A' + B' + C' + \\cdots + H' + I' + J'$$ And $$(A + B + C + \\cdots + H + I + J)' = A'B'C'D'E'F'G'H'I'J'$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this. The user wants me to act as a math professor and structure their problem into the specified format. The example given shows how assumptions are listed and the problem is restated. \n\nLooking at the original problem from Math Stack Exchange: the user is asking about De Morgan's theorem for three variables, specifically for (A + B + C)'. They found the version for (ABC)' being equal to A' + B' + C', but they want to know the equivalent for the OR case.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The example listed each assumption line by line, each addressing one property. In the original example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is about De Morgan's theorem applied to three variables. \n\nSo, the key assumptions here would be related to the variables A, B, and C. De Morgan's laws in general apply to Boolean algebra or propositional logic, where the variables are Boolean (true/false). The user is probably working under the context that A, B, C are Boolean variables. Also, the prime symbol (') denotes negation. \n\nTherefore, the assumptions should be:\n- A, B, C are Boolean variables.\n- The prime (') denotes the negation operation.\n- The operations + and juxtaposition (like AB) represent OR and AND operations respectively, which is standard in Boolean algebra.\n\nBut wait, in the example, each assumption is a single line, one property per line. So each assumption is about one object. Here, the variables A, B, C are each Boolean, but maybe each variable's type is a separate assumption. Alternatively, stating that A, B, C are Boolean variables as one assumption. However, the example grouped \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate lines. So perhaps each variable being Boolean is a separate assumption? But that would be redundant. Probably, it's better to state that A, B, C are Boolean variables as one assumption. Then, the notation for negation as another, and the operations as another.\n\nWait, the example didn't have to state the operations because it was about divisibility. Here, the problem is about De Morgan's theorem, which involves logical operations. So the operations need to be defined. Let's think: De Morgan's laws relate AND and OR with negations. The user is using + for OR and juxtaposition for AND, and ' for negation. So perhaps the assumptions should include that:\n\n- A, B, C are Boolean variables.\n- The symbol '+' represents the logical OR operation.\n- The juxtaposition (e.g., AB) represents the logical AND operation.\n- The prime symbol (') represents the logical NOT operation.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about the object (n) and its properties. Here, the problem is about the structure of the expression. However, since De Morgan's theorem is a general law in Boolean algebra, the assumptions are about the context in which the theorem is applied. So the problem is asking for the form of De Morgan's theorem when applied to three variables in an OR expression. Therefore, the necessary assumptions would be about the variables being Boolean and the operations used. Each of these could be separate assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem doesn't require any specific assumptions beyond the variables being Boolean, because De Morgan's theorem is a general rule. But the example given in the user's instruction included specific assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. However, in this case, the problem is more about a general theorem rather than a specific problem with conditions. So perhaps the assumptions are minimal here. Let me check again the original question.\n\nOriginal question: \"What is De-Morgan's theorem for (A + B + C)'?\" The user found the version for (ABC)' and wants to know the OR version for three variables. So the answer would be (A + B + C)' = A'B'C'. But to state this as a problem, perhaps the problem is to prove or state the theorem. However, the user is just asking what the theorem is. \n\nBut according to the user's format, they want the problem structured into assumptions and the problem statement. So in this case, the assumptions would be the variables are Boolean, and the operations are defined as OR (+), AND (juxtaposition), and NOT ('). Then the problem is to state or prove De Morgan's theorem for (A + B + C)'. \n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nA, B, C are Boolean variables,\nThe '+' operator represents logical OR,\nThe juxtaposition of variables (e.g., AB) represents logical AND,\nThe prime symbol (') represents logical NOT.\n\nProblem:\nState De Morgan's theorem for the expression (A + B + C)'.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is to prove the theorem, then the problem statement would be \"Prove De Morgan's theorem for (A + B + C)'\".\n\nBut the original question is asking \"What is De-Morgan's theorem for (A + B + C)'?\" So perhaps the problem is to state it. However, the example given was a problem to prove something. So maybe the user expects the problem to be phrased as a proof problem. Let me check the example again:\n\nOriginal example problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91, with assumptions on n. So in the current case, maybe the problem is to prove that (A + B + C)' equals A'B'C', under the assumptions of Boolean variables and the operations. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nA, B, C are Boolean variables,\nThe '+' operator represents logical OR,\nThe juxtaposition of variables represents logical AND,\nThe prime symbol (') represents logical NOT.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$(A + B + C)' = A'B'C'$$.\n\nThat seems to fit the format. Each assumption is a separate line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. The problem is to prove the equality using De Morgan's theorem for three variables.",
