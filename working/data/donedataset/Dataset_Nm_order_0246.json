    "Content": "Question: Under what circumstances does local convexity imply global convexity? Motivation: Classically, a twice differentiable function $f:\\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is convex if and only if the second derivative is nonnegative everywhere. In this recent question, Derivative of Convex Functional , it's shown that the same result holds for twice Frechet differentiable functionals on Banach spaces, $f:X\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$. In both these cases, we have a result saying something to the effect of: \" local convexity implies global convexity \". How far can this idea be generalized? The following hypothesis, which may or may not be true, expresses the idea in the most general context I can think of. Conjecture: Let $C$ be a connected subset of a topological vector space , and let $\\{ U_\\alpha \\}_{\\alpha \\in A}$ be an open cover of the boundary $\\partial C$. If $U_\\alpha \\cap C$ is convex for all $\\alpha \\in A$, then $C$ is convex. Informally, \"Inspect the boundary of a connected set with a (variable-size) magnifying glass. If, everywhere you look, it looks convex, then the set is globally convex.\" Example: $C$ is a square in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, and $U_\\alpha=B_i$ are balls covering all 4 edges and corners. Non-example: $C$ is two disjoint disks in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. From this we see that there is a topological element to the question - if the connectedness condition is relaxed, it's easy to come up with counterexamples. Notes: I've linked the key terms to the wiki pages. Is this good style on M.SE? Most people who could answer the question would already know the definition. On the other hand, when I'm answering a question that's not immediately obvious, a lot of times I'll open up the wiki page and look around even if I already know the definition. A special case I've been considering is where the space is Banach, and the set's boundary is path connected and compact. In this case I think it's true but the proof is elusive so far.. In the comments Chris Eagle suggests reducing it to a 2D problem. I'm not sure exactly how this works and if it will generalize to spaces other than $\\mathbb{R}^n$. In the comments Cardinal notes that it is trivally false in the discrete topology - the boundary of any set can be covered by open points. Joriki points out that this isn't a problem since all nontrivial sets of interest are not connected in the discrete topology. George Lowther notes that the conjecture is false in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ unless a further constraint is added that the set is either closed or open. The open unit square unioned with it's vertices is locally convex, but does not contain it's edges so is not globally convex.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "We suppose that $X$ is a locally convex vector space. Before showing that the conjecture is true (under some conditions), we show a helpful lemma. Lemma. If a subset $C$ of $X$ has the property that it's boundary can be covered by an open cover $\\{U_\\alpha\\}_{\\alpha\\in A}$ with the property that each $U_\\alpha\\cap C$ is convex, then the triangle\n$$\n\\Delta(x,y,z):=\\{(1-t)((1-s)x+sy)+tz:s,t\\in[0,1)\\}\n$$\nis contained in $C$ whenever the lines $\\ell_{x,y}:=\\{(1-s)x+sy:s\\in[0,1]\\}$ and $\\ell_{x,z}:=\\{(1-t)x+tz:t\\in[0,1]\\}$ are contained in $C$. Proof. Suppose that $\\Delta(x,y,z)$ is not contained in $C$. In the following, the boundary and interior are considered relative to the triangle $\\Delta(x,y,z)$. Among $s\\in[0,1)$ with the property that the line\n$$\n\\{(1-t)((1-s)x+sy)+tz:t\\in[0,1)\\}\\cap \\partial(C\\cap\\Delta(x,y,z))\\neq\\varnothing\n$$\nthere is a minimum $s_0$. Then there is also a minimum $t_0$ among the $t\\in[0,1)$ with the property that\n$$\nu:=(1-t)((1-s_0)x+s_0y)+tz:t\\in\\partial(C\\cap\\Delta(x,y,z))\n$$\nSince $u$ is on the boundary of $C$, there exists an $\\alpha\\in A$ with the property that $u\\in U_\\alpha$. Then $U_\\alpha\\cap C\\cap\\Delta(x,y,z)$ is convex. But note that the set\n$$\n\\ell_{x,y}\\cup\\ell_{x,z}\\cup\\Delta(x,(1-s_0)x+s_0y,z),\n$$\nwhere the latter triangle has a similar definition as $\\Delta(x,y,z)$, is contained in $C$. The convexity of $U_\\alpha\\cap C\\cap\\Delta(x,y,z)$ then implies that there is a $\\varepsilon>0$ such that the point\n$$\n(1-(t_0-\\varepsilon))((1-s_0)x+s_0y)+(t_0-\\varepsilon)z\n$$\nis on the boundary of $C\\cap\\Delta(x,y,z)$ unless $t_0=0$. The minimality of $t_0$ then gives us that $t_0=0$. A similar argument shows that $s_0=0$ and it follows once again from the convexity of the boundary of $C$ that $x,y,z$ are on a line. But then $\\Delta(x,y,z)$ is (contained in) this line. QED. We have the following corollary (in the open case, an easy adjustment of the above proof has to be given). Corollary. If $X$ is either open or closed, the triangle\n$$\n\\overline{\\Delta(x,y,z)}=\\{(1-t)((1-s)x+sy)+tz:s,t\\in[0,1]\\}\n$$\nis contained in $C$. Now we are ready to answer positive to the conjecture in the case that $C$ is open or closed. Proposition. Suppose that $X$ is a locally convex vector space and suppose that $C$ is a closed [open] subset of $X$. If there exists a cover $\\{U_\\alpha\\}_{\\alpha\\in A}$ of $\\partial C$ with the property that $U_\\alpha\\cap C$ is convex for each $\\alpha\\in A$, then $C$ is convex. Proof. Suppose $C$ is a subset of a locally convex vector space $X$ and that $\\{U_\\alpha\\}_{\\alpha\\in A}$ is a cover of the boundary of $C$ with the property that $U_\\alpha\\cap C$ is convex for each $\\alpha\\in A$. First, let $B$ be a maximal among the subsets of $A$ with the property that the convex hull of $\\bigcup_{\\alpha\\in B}U_\\alpha$ is contained in $C$. For example, such a maximal $B$ can be found with Zorn's lemma, using the poset\n$$\nP:=\\big\\{B\\subseteq A:\\mathrm{Hull}\\big(\\textstyle\\bigcup_{\\alpha\\in B}U_\\alpha\\cap C\\big)\\subseteq C\\big\\}\n$$\nordered with inclusion. Here, $\\mathrm{Hull}$ denotes the operation of taking the convex hull. Now let $C^\\prime$ be a maximal convex subset of $C$ which contains $U_\\alpha$ for each $\\alpha\\in B$. Here's an outline of the rest of the proof. First we will show that if for $\\alpha\\in A$ there is a $\\beta\\in B$ such that $U_\\alpha\\cap U_\\beta\\cap C\\neq\\varnothing$, then $\\alpha$ is in $B$. Then we will show that no boundary points of $C^\\prime$ are interior points of $C$. (Here we will use the assumption that $X$ is locally convex.) With these two observations the proof is easily finished. Since boundary points of $C^\\prime$ are boundary points of $C$, it follows that $C^\\prime$ is closed in $C$. The set\n$$\nU:=\\textstyle\\bigcup_{\\alpha\\in B} U_\\alpha\\cup\\mathrm{int}\\,C^\\prime\n$$ \nis an open set with the property that $x\\in C^\\prime$ whenever $x\\in U\\cap C$, therefore $C^\\prime$ is also open in $C$. The connectedness of $C$ together with the non-emptiness of $C^\\prime$ (whenever $C$ is non-empty) now implies that $C^\\prime= C$. Proof of 1. Suppose that $x\\in U_\\alpha\\cap U_\\beta\\cap C$. Note that for any $y\\in U_\\alpha$, for any $\\gamma\\in B$ and for any $z\\in U_\\gamma$, the line\n$$\n\\ell_{y,z}:=\\{(1-t)y+tz:t\\in[0,1]\\}\n$$\nis contained in $C$, which is a consequence of the corollary because the we have $\\ell_{x,y}\\subseteq U_\\alpha\\cap C\\subseteq C$ and $\\ell_{x,z}\\subseteq C^\\prime\\subseteq C$. By the maximality of $B$, it follows that $\\alpha\\in B$. Proof of 2. Suppose that $x^\\prime$ is in $\\partial C^\\prime\\cap\\mathrm{int}\\,C$. Let $V$ be a convex open neighborhood of $x^\\prime$ which is contained in $C$, let $y$ be a point of $V\\setminus \\bar{C^\\prime}$ and let $x$ be a point of $V\\cap C^\\prime$. It follows by the corollary that for every $z\\in C^\\prime$ the line $\\ell_{y,z}$ is contained in $C$, since the lines $\\ell_{x,y}$ and $\\ell_{x,z}$ are. Therefore, $C^\\prime$ can be extended to include $y$, which contradicts the maximality of $C^\\prime$. Thus we may conclude that no boundary points of $C^\\prime$ are interior points of $C$. QED.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this Math Stack Exchange question and format it according to the user's guidelines. The original question is about whether local convexity implies global convexity under certain circumstances. The user provided an example and a non-example, and there are some notes and comments discussing edge cases and specific instances where the conjecture might fail.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the main problem and list all the assumptions. The user mentions a conjecture that they want to explore. The key components here are the connected subset C of a topological vector space, an open cover of the boundary, and the condition that each intersection of the open sets with C is convex. \n\nAssumptions need to be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let's break down the conjecture:\n\n1. C is a connected subset of a topological vector space. That's one assumption about C.\n2. There's an open cover {U_α} of the boundary ∂C. This is about the open cover, so each U_α is an open set in the topological space, and their union covers the boundary.\n3. For each α, the intersection U_α ∩ C is convex. This is a separate condition for each open set in the cover.\n\nThe problem is to determine if under these assumptions, C is convex. The original conjecture is phrased as a statement, but since the question is asking under what circumstances local convexity implies global convexity, I think the problem should be posed as proving or disproving the conjecture.\n\nWait, the user's example format for the problem section was \"Prove that...\", but in this case, the problem is more about determining whether the conjecture is true or not. However, looking at the example given by the user, they transformed the original problem into a \"Prove that...\" statement. The original question here is phrased as \"Under what circumstances...\" which is more general, but the conjecture provides specific conditions. The user's conjecture is a specific scenario, so perhaps the problem is to prove or disprove that conjecture.\n\nBut the user's instruction says to structure the problem as per the example. The example took the original problem and listed assumptions, then restated the problem. In the example, the original problem had an extra condition (n divisible by 7) that was included in the assumptions, but in the problem statement, it's part of the formatted problem. Wait, looking back at the example:\n\nOriginal problem was to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem had assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Then the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. Wait, but in the original problem, n was every integer, but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7? That seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect? Let me check again.\n\nWait, the original example says: Original problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91. Then the formatted problem's assumptions are: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But 91 is 7*13. So perhaps the original problem had a missing condition? Or maybe the example is a mistake. Wait, perhaps the example is a problem where the user filtered out some conditions. Wait, maybe the user is demonstrating how to structure a problem, even if the original problem might have had different conditions. Maybe in their example, they added an assumption (n divisible by 7) to make it fit a certain structure. Hmm, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds that n is divisible by 7. That might be an error in the example. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instruction to structure the given problem.\n\nSo, back to the current problem. The original question's conjecture is:\n\nConjecture: Let C be a connected subset of a topological vector space, and let {U_α} be an open cover of the boundary ∂C. If U_α ∩ C is convex for all α ∈ A, then C is convex.\n\nSo the assumptions here are:\n\n1. C is a connected subset of a topological vector space.\n2. {U_α} is an open cover of ∂C.\n3. For each α ∈ A, U_α ∩ C is convex.\n\nThe problem is to prove or disprove that C is convex under these assumptions.\n\nBut in the example, the user structured the problem by listing the assumptions, then the problem statement. So here, the problem would be \"Prove that C is convex\".\n\nHowever, the original question is phrased as a conjecture, so perhaps the problem is to determine whether the conjecture is true, i.e., \"Prove or disprove the conjecture: ...\". But the example only had \"Prove that...\". Since the user's example used \"Prove that...\", maybe we need to stick to that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to \"Determine under what circumstances local convexity implies global convexity\" but the conjecture provides specific circumstances. So the problem as per the conjecture is \"Prove that C is convex under the given assumptions\".\n\nBut in the example, the user rephrased the problem with the assumptions listed, even if the original problem had a broader scope. So following that, here's how to structure:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- C is a connected subset of a topological vector space.\n- {U_α} is an open cover of the boundary ∂C.\n- For each α ∈ A, the intersection U_α ∩ C is convex.\n\nProblem: Prove that C is convex.\n\nAlternatively, since the original problem is a conjecture, maybe it's better to phrase it as \"Prove or disprove that C is convex\".\n\nBut the example used \"Prove that...\", so perhaps the user prefers that. However, in the original question, the user also mentions that George Lowther notes the conjecture is false unless further constraints are added. But the user is asking to structure the problem as per the conjecture, not the counterexamples. Wait, the problem is to structure the problem as presented, filtering unrelated information. The original question's main problem is the conjecture. The notes and comments are additional discussions but the core problem is the conjecture.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list the assumptions as per the conjecture and the problem is to prove that C is convex. Even though there are counterexamples mentioned in the notes, those are part of the discussion but not part of the original problem statement. The user wants to filter unrelated information. So the problem is to prove or disprove the conjecture as stated, but according to the user's example, it's structured as a \"Prove that...\" problem. However, in the example, the original problem had an error where an extra condition was added. Maybe the user's example was flawed, but I should follow the structure they demonstrated.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. C is a connected subset of a topological vector space.\n2. {U_α} is an open cover of the boundary ∂C.\n3. For each α ∈ A, U_α ∩ C is convex.\n\nProblem: Prove that C is convex.\n\nBut the original conjecture is phrased as \"If [conditions], then C is convex\". So the problem is to prove that implication. Therefore, the formatted problem should be \"Prove that if [conditions], then C is convex\", but according to the user's example, the conditions are listed as assumptions, and the problem is restated concisely.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$C$ is a connected subset of a topological vector space,\n$\\{ U_\\alpha \\}_{\\alpha \\in A}$ is an open cover of the boundary $\\partial C$,\nFor each $\\alpha \\in A$, the intersection $U_\\alpha \\cap C$ is convex.\nProblem: \nProve that $C$ is convex.\n###",
