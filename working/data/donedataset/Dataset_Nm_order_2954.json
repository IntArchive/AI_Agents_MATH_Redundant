    "Content": "This is Problem 1.7 from Gouvea's lecture notes on deformations of Galois representations . In particular, he asks you to show that it has many subgroups of finite index which are not closed. So here's what I've got so far, which may be wrong. I can write the compositum as F = Q [√–1, √2, √3, √5, √7 ...] (can I?) and then the Galois group G = Gal(F/ Q )  is isomorphic to a direct product Π p ( Z /2 Z ) where the product is taken over all primes p, as well as p=-1, and the pth component is generated by the conjugation σ p defined by √p -> –√p. An example of a subgroup which isn't closed would be the subgroup H consisting of finite products of conjugations, since for example, H contains the sequence σ 2 , σ 2 σ 3 , σ 2 σ 3 σ 5 , σ 2 σ 3 σ 5 σ 7 ... which converges to the automorphism \"conjugate everything\", and this automorphism is not contained in H . However this subgroup is nowhere near being finite index--it has the cardinality of the natural numbers, whereas G has the cardinality of the reals. The only finite index subgroups I can think of take are of the form Gal(F/K) where K is a finite extension of Q , but of course these are by definition all closed. So I guess I've stuffed up somewhere, and I'd be really grateful for any help?! In know this may seem a bit \"homework questiony\" but it's not, it's just something that's really bugging me!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let's forget the Galois group structure: it is enough to consider the infinite product $G = \\mathbb{Z}/(2)^\\mathbb{N}$ with its profinite topology and exhibit non-closed subgroups of finite index. An element of $G$ is naturally identified with a subset of $\\mathbb{N}$: the string $(a_i)$ corresponds to the subset $A$ such that $n \\in A$ if and only if $a_n = 1$. With this interpretation, the operation on $G$ just becomes the symmetric difference of sets. Now consider the filter $F'$ of all cofinite subsets of $\\mathbb{N}$, and let $F$ be any ultrafilter containing it. I show that we can associate to $F$ a subgroup of index $2$. The $F$ will be non closed since $F$ is not a principal ultrafilter (indeed any non-principal ultrafilter will do). Consider the characteristic function of $F$: $$f = \\chi_F \\colon G = \\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{N}) \\to \\mathbb{Z}/(2)$$. I claim that this is a homomorphism, and its kernel is the desired subgroup. This is easy to verify directly. Let $A, B \\in G$ and assume $f(A) = f(B) = 0$. This means that neither $A$ nor $B$ belong to $F$, so their complementary sets do. It follows that $A^c \\cap B^c \\in F$, so that $A \\cup B \\notin F$. A fortiori the symmetric difference $A \\Delta B \\notin F$, whic means $f(A \\Delta B) = 0$. The other cases are similar.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this Math Stack Exchange question and structure it according to the required format. The user wants me to act as a math professor who can filter out the unnecessary information and present the problem clearly.\n\nFirst, reading the original problem. The title is about describing the Galois group of the compositum of all quadratic extensions of Q. The user, in their question, mentions that they're trying to show that this Galois group has many subgroups of finite index which are not closed. They give some details about their approach, like writing the compositum as F = Q[√-1, √2, √3, √5, ...] and the Galois group G being isomorphic to a direct product of Z/2Z over primes and p=-1. They also talk about a subgroup H consisting of finite products of conjugations, but realize that H isn't closed and has issues with cardinality. However, their example of H isn't finite index, so they're stuck.\n\nThe task here is to extract the core problem and list the assumptions. The original problem from Gouvea's notes is Problem 1.7, which asks to show that the Galois group has many subgroups of finite index that are not closed. The user's own steps and confusion are part of the question, but the actual problem to be formatted is the one from the textbook.\n\nSo, the main problem is: Show that the Galois group of the compositum of all quadratic extensions of Q has many subgroups of finite index which are not closed.\n\nAssumptions here would be about the compositum F being the compositum of all quadratic extensions of Q, that the Galois group G is Gal(F/Q), and that we are considering subgroups of G with finite index that are not closed in the profinite topology. Each assumption should be one line, addressing one property or condition.\n\nBut wait, the user mentions that the compositum F is generated by square roots of all primes and -1. So maybe the assumptions include that F is the compositum of Q(√p) for all primes p and p=-1. Also, the Galois group is a direct product of copies of Z/2Z, one for each generator. Each automorphism is determined by its action on each square root, flipping the sign or not. The topology here is the profinite topology, so closed subgroups correspond to subfields via Galois correspondence.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the key assumptions are:\n\n1. F is the compositum of all quadratic extensions of Q. (This includes all square roots of primes and -1)\n2. G = Gal(F/Q) is the Galois group of F over Q.\n3. G is considered as a profinite group (with the Krull topology).\n\nBut the problem is to show that G has many finite index subgroups that are not closed. So the problem is about the structure of G's subgroups in the profinite context.\n\nSo structuring:\n\nAssumption: F is the compositum of all quadratic extensions of Q.\nAssumption: G = Gal(F/Q) is the Galois group of F over Q.\nAssumption: G is equipped with the profinite topology.\n\nProblem: Show that G has many subgroups of finite index which are not closed.\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"it has many subgroups of finite index which are not closed\". The user's version is \"show that it has many subgroups of finite index which are not closed.\"\n\nSo, the problem as per the original is: Prove that the Galois group G of the compositum of all quadratic extensions of Q has many subgroups of finite index that are not closed.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list the necessary assumptions:\n\n1. F is the compositum of all quadratic extensions of Q.\n2. G is the Galois group of F over Q.\n3. G is considered as a profinite group with the Krull topology.\n\nEach assumption is one line, one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nF is the compositum of all quadratic extensions of Q,\nG is the Galois group of F over Q,\nG is equipped with the profinite topology.\n\nProblem:\nShow that G has many subgroups of finite index which are not closed.\n\nBut let's check the example given. The example's problem had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Then the problem is to prove divisibility. So in the example, they split the conditions into separate lines. For the current problem, the key assumptions are:\n\n1. F is the compositum of all quadratic extensions of Q.\n2. G is the Galois group of F over Q.\n3. The topology on G is the profinite (Krull) topology.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. Then the problem is to show G has many finite index subgroups that are not closed.\n\nSo I think that's the correct structure.",
