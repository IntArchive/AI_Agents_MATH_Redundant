    "Content": "I'm reading a proof of the Cauchy formula for the derivatives of an holomorphic function from some lecture notes . The author first proves that\n$$f^{(n)}(z)=\\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\\int_{C}\\frac{f^{(n)}(\\zeta)}{\\zeta-z}\\;d\\zeta$$\nwhere $C$ is a circumference enclosing $z$. Then he says: \"... integrating this by parts $n$ times gives the required formula...\" \nI don't understand what he means with integrating by parts; this is a technique used in real analysis! In complex analysis, what is the integration by parts?\nPractically from the above formula I have problems to get: $$f^{(n)}(z)=\\frac{n!}{2\\pi i}\\int_{C}\\frac{f(\\zeta)}{{(\\zeta-z)}^{n+1}}\\;d\\zeta$$ Thanks in advance.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "It's the same thing. The fundamental theorem of calculus here says: Let $\\gamma \\colon [0,1] \\to \\mathbb{C}$ a differentiable path (I restrict to differentiable paths for simplicity, piecewise differentiable paths can be handled with minimal additional considerations), and $f$ a holomorphic function defined in a neighbourhood of the trace of $\\gamma$. Then $$f(\\gamma(1)) - f(\\gamma(0)) = \\int_\\gamma f'(z)\\,dz.$$ Inserting the definitions, we get $$\\int_\\gamma f'(z)\\,dz = \\int_0^1 f'(\\gamma(t))\\cdot \\gamma'(t)\\,dt = \\int_0^1 \\bigl(f\\circ\\gamma\\bigr)'(t)\\,dt,$$ which is just the real version. So if we have two holomorphic functions $f,g$, then by the real theory $$\\begin{align}\n\\int_\\gamma f'(z)g(z)\\,dz &= \\int_0^1 f'(\\gamma(t))g(\\gamma(t))\\gamma'(t)\\,dt\\\\\n&= \\int_0^1 \\bigl(f\\circ\\gamma\\bigr)'(t)(g\\circ\\gamma)(t)\\,dt\\\\\n&= \\left[(f\\circ\\gamma)\\cdot(g\\circ\\gamma)\\right]_0^1 - \\int_0^1 (f\\circ\\gamma)(t)\\bigl(g\\circ\\gamma)'(t)\\,dt\\\\\n&= - \\int_\\gamma f(z)g'(z)\\,dz\n\\end{align}$$ for a closed path $\\gamma$. The boundary term remains of course if $\\gamma$ is not closed.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user is asking about integrating by parts in complex analysis, specifically how applying it n times to the given integral leads to the Cauchy formula for derivatives. Hmm, in real analysis, integration by parts involves the product rule for derivatives, but complex integration is different. So the key here is to figure out what \"integration by parts\" means in the context of complex integrals.\n\nFirst, the original formula presented is for the nth derivative of f(z) as an integral involving f^(n)(ζ). But the desired formula has f(ζ) in the numerator and (ζ - z)^{n+1} in the denominator. The user is confused because the author mentions integrating by parts n times, which is a real analysis technique.\n\nWait, in complex analysis, integration by parts isn't directly the same, but maybe there's an analogous method. Let's think. If you have an integral of u dv, maybe you can express it as uv minus the integral of v du, similar to real analysis. But here, the integral is over a closed contour. So perhaps integrating by parts would involve differentiating the kernel function.\n\nLooking at the integral: ∫_C [f^{(n)}(ζ)/(ζ - z)] dζ. If we want to reduce the derivative order on f, maybe each integration by parts moves the derivative from f to the 1/(ζ - z) term. But how does that work? Differentiating 1/(ζ - z) with respect to ζ would give -1/(ζ - z)^2, right? So each time you integrate by parts, you might get a factor of -1 and an increase in the exponent of (ζ - z). But since we're dealing with contour integrals, boundary terms from integration by parts (like uv evaluated at endpoints) would vanish because the contour is closed. That makes sense. So each integration by parts would convert f^{(k)}(ζ) to f^{(k-1)}(ζ) and increase the power in the denominator by 1, along with a factorial factor? After n times, the derivative on f would disappear, and the denominator becomes (ζ - z)^{n+1}, with a factor of n! from the repeated differentiation. That must be how it works. So the assumptions would involve the function f being holomorphic inside and on the contour C, the contour enclosing z, and perhaps the differentiability of f up to nth order. The problem is to show how integrating by parts n times transforms the integral of f^{(n)}(ζ)/(ζ - z) into the standard Cauchy formula with n! and f(ζ)/(ζ - z)^{n+1}.",
