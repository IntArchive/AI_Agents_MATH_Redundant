    "Content": "In Chow's You Could Have Invented Spectral Sequences (3rd page, left column) appears the following isomorphism of vector spaces:\n$$\\frac{Z_d}{B_d}\\cong \\frac{Z_d+C_{d,1}}{B_d+C_{d,1}}\\oplus \\frac{Z_d\\cap C_{d,1}}{B_d\\cap C_{d,1}}$$\nThe context is a 2-degree filtered chain complex $C_\\bullet$. Why does this relation hold? I tried the second isomorphism theorem    but didn't manage to get anything out of it. After that, the author says the naive hope is that\n$$E_{d,2}^{1}\\overset{?}{\\cong}\\frac{Z_{d}+C_{d,1}}{B_{d}+C_{d,1}}=\\frac{Z_{d,2}+C_{d,1}}{B_{d,2}+C_{d,1}}$$\nBut that this does not, in general, hold.\nNow, I know relative homology groups are isomorphic to the quotient of relative cycles by relative boundaries. Isn't this precisely the quotient $\\frac{Z_{d}+C_{d,1}}{B_{d}+C_{d,1}}$? Hence, isn't there an isomorphism\n$$H_{d}(C_{\\bullet}/C_{1\\bullet})\\cong\\frac{Z_{d}+C_{d,1}}{B_{d}+C_{d,1}}$$\nwhere $C_\\bullet$ is the original complex and $C_{1\\bullet}$ is the complex in the first filtration degree? Now by definition $E^1_{d,2}=H_d(C_{\\bullet}/C_{1\\bullet})$, so it seems the isomorphism below does hold.\n$$E_{d,2}^{1}\\cong\\frac{Z_{d}+C_{d,1}}{B_{d}+C_{d,1}}=\\frac{Z_{d,2}+C_{d,1}}{B_{d,2}+C_{d,1}}$$ What is my error? Why doesn't the isomorphism above always hold? Finally, the author says that generally  $E^1_{d,1} \\ncong \\frac{Z_{d,1}}{B_{d,1}}$. But isn't $E^1_{d,1} = H(C_{1\\bullet}/0)\\cong H(C_{1\\bullet})$ by definition? ($C_{1\\bullet}$ is the complex at the first filtration degree.) But $H(C_{1\\bullet})=\\frac{Z_{d,1}}{B_{d,1}}$ by definition, so again, I get the isomorphism does hold. What is my mistake here? Added: I don't understand what the boundary maps $\\partial ^0$ are. Help is appreciated. Update: I think I have detected my first mistake. Although the definition of relative boundaries is indeed $B_d$ relative to $C_{d-1}$ equals $B_d+C_{d-1}$, this is not how relative cycles are defined. Instead, $Z_d$ relative to $C_{d-1}$ equals $ \\left\\{ \\gamma \\in C_d:\\partial _d \\gamma \\in C_{d-1} \\right\\}\\neq Z_d+C_{d-1}$. Note - for context for these relative boundaries and cycles, see Rotman's Introduction to Algebraic Topology , p.99. This resolves most of my issues because now I really don't except those isomorphisms. Of course I would like someone to confirm I'm not spewing nonsense, since Rotman only defined these for pairs of spaces - I just figured they work for filtrations aswell (by the third isomorphism theorem). I think the only things bugging me now are (see Chow's article): Why does the first relation hold, and what exactly is $\\partial ^0$? Update 2: I think I have realized what $\\partial ^0$ is. For each quotient $E_{d,p}^0$ we have an induced boundary map $\\partial_{d,p}^0:E_{d,p}^0\\rightarrow E_{d-1,p}^0$ defined by $$\\partial_{d,p}^0:[\\gamma]\\mapsto[\\partial_{d,p} \\gamma]$$ where $\\partial _{d,p}$ is the $d^{\\text{th}}$ boundary of the complex $C_{p\\bullet}$. $\\partial ^0=\\partial ^0_d:\\bigoplus _{p=1}^nE^0_{d,p}\\rightarrow \\bigoplus _{p=1}^nE^0_{d-1,p}$ is simply the direct sum of all these induced boundary maps. Is this correct?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The first relation: take any vector space with subspaces $C, Z\\supseteq B$. The natural surjection $Z/B \\to (Z+C)/(B+C)$ has kernel $(Z\\cap C +B)/B$ which is isomorphic to $Z\\cap C /B\\cap C$ so the isomorphism you want follows from the first isomorphism theorem. $\\partial^0$ is the map formed as the direct sum of the maps $C_{dp}/C_{d,p-1}\\to C_{d-1,p}/C_{d-1,p-1} $ given by $c + C_{d,p-1}\\mapsto \\partial(c)+ C_{d-1,p-1}$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse through this question. The user is asking about some vector space identities in Chow's article related to spectral sequences. There are a few parts to the problem they're confused about. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the main problem they mentioned is the isomorphism:\n$$\n\\frac{Z_d}{B_d} \\cong \\frac{Z_d + C_{d,1}}{B_d + C_{d,1}} \\oplus \\frac{Z_d \\cap C_{d,1}}{B_d \\cap C_{d,1}}\n$$\nThey tried using the second isomorphism theorem but didn't get anywhere. Then, they're confused about why certain isomorphisms in the spectral sequence setup don't hold as naively expected. They also mention issues with understanding the boundary maps ∂⁰ and relative homology groups.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the key is to list each assumption line by line. The original problem here is from homological algebra involving filtered chain complexes. Let's identify the assumptions. \n\n1. The context is a 2-degree filtered chain complex C_•. So, the complex has a filtration, probably C_• ⊃ C_{1•} ⊃ C_{2•} or something similar. But since it's 2-degree, maybe the filtration has two stages?\n\nWait, the user mentions C_{d,1} which might refer to the filtration degree 1 part in dimension d. So, perhaps each chain group C_d is filtered as C_{d,1} ⊆ C_d. \n\nAssumptions from the problem:\n\n- The setup involves a filtered chain complex C_• with a filtration degree. Specifically, they mention C_{d,1}, which is part of the filtration.\n\n- The objects Z_d and B_d are the cycles and boundaries in dimension d. The user refers to Z_d as cycles, B_d as boundaries.\n\n- The user is working within the context of spectral sequences, so the isomorphism is part of the construction of the spectral sequence associated with the filtration.\n\n- The problem involves quotient vector spaces (since it's an isomorphism of vector spaces), so we are in an abelian category where such quotients make sense.\n\n- The user mentions the second isomorphism theorem, which in vector spaces states that (A + B)/B ≅ A/(A ∩ B). Maybe trying to apply that here.\n\nThe main problem the user wants to resolve is why the first isomorphism holds:\n$$\n\\frac{Z_d}{B_d} \\cong \\frac{Z_d + C_{d,1}}{B_d + C_{d,1}} \\oplus \\frac{Z_d \\cap C_{d,1}}{B_d \\cap C_{d,1}}\n$$\nAdditionally, they are confused about why certain isomorphisms in the spectral sequence don't hold, particularly E^1_{d,2} not being isomorphic to (Z_{d,2} + C_{d,1})/(B_{d,2} + C_{d,1}), and similar for E^1_{d,1}.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the user later realized that relative cycles are not just Z_d + C_{d,1} but something more involved, which resolves part of their confusion. However, they still need confirmation on why the initial isomorphism holds and clarification on ∂⁰.\n\nSo, to structure the problem according to the required format:\n\nAssumptions should list each condition applied to one object. So for the main isomorphism:\n\n- C_• is a filtered chain complex (2-degree filtration).\n\n- Z_d is the group of cycles in degree d.\n\n- B_d is the group of boundaries in degree d.\n\n- C_{d,1} is the filtration degree 1 subgroup of C_d.\n\n- The problem considers the quotient spaces formed by these subgroups.\n\nThe problem is to prove the given isomorphism of vector spaces. The user also asks about the boundary maps ∂⁰, but since the example only includes the main problem, maybe focus on the isomorphism first.\n\nWait, in the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7, but here, the assumptions are properties of the chain complex and its subgroups.\n\nSo, listing each assumption line by line:\n\nAssumption:\n- C_• is a 2-degree filtered chain complex,\n- Z_d is the group of cycles in degree d,\n- B_d is the group of boundaries in degree d,\n- C_{d,1} is a subgroup of C_d in the filtration,\n- The quotient spaces are vector spaces (since the isomorphism is of vector spaces).\n\nProblem: Prove that $$\\frac{Z_d}{B_d} \\cong \\frac{Z_d + C_{d,1}}{B_d + C_{d,1}} \\oplus \\frac{Z_d \\cap C_{d,1}}{B_d \\cap C_{d,1}}$$ holds for the given filtered chain complex.\n\nAdditionally, the user had other questions about the spectral sequence pages and boundary maps, but the main problem they started with is this isomorphism.\n\nBut in the original question, the user also mentions the context of a 2-degree filtered chain complex. So, maybe the filtration is such that each C_d has a subspace C_{d,1}, and the complex is filtered as C_{•,1} ⊂ C_•.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- C_• is a chain complex with a filtration C_{•,1} ⊆ C_•,\n- Z_d = ker(∂_d: C_d → C_{d-1}),\n- B_d = im(∂_{d+1}: C_{d+1} → C_d),\n- C_{d,1} is a subspace of C_d (part of the filtration),\n- The quotients considered are vector spaces.\n\nProblem: Prove the vector space isomorphism $$\\frac{Z_d}{B_d} \\cong \\frac{Z_d + C_{d,1}}{B_d + C_{d,1}} \\oplus \\frac{Z_d \\cap C_{d,1}}{B_d \\cap C_{d,1}}$$.\n\nBut to check if this is correct, maybe the key is to use isomorphism theorems. The user tried the second isomorphism theorem. Let's recall that for vector spaces, if we have subspaces U and W, then (U + W)/W ≅ U/(U ∩ W). But here, the situation might be different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this is an instance of the splitting of the quotient Z_d/B_d into two parts related to the filtration. If we have a filtration, we can decompose the space into the part inside the filtration and the part outside. Then, the quotient could split accordingly.\n\nBut how to structure this? The left-hand side is the homology group H_d = Z_d/B_d. The right-hand side is a direct sum of two quotients. The first quotient is (Z_d + C_{d,1})/(B_d + C_{d,1}), which might represent homology relative to the filtration, and the second quotient is (Z_d ∩ C_{d,1})/(B_d ∩ C_{d,1}), which is homology within the filtration.\n\nBut the user mentions that after considering Rotman's definition of relative cycles, they realized that their initial assumption was wrong. However, the problem as stated in Chow's article has this isomorphism, so maybe under the specific setup of the filtration and chain complex, this decomposition holds.\n\nSo, to structure the problem as per the example, list each assumption:\n\n- C_• is a 2-degree filtered chain complex.\n- Z_d is the group of cycles in degree d.\n- B_d is the group of boundaries in degree d.\n- C_{d,1} is a filtered subgroup of C_d.\n- The quotient spaces are vector spaces.\n\nProblem: Prove that the isomorphism $$\\frac{Z_d}{B_d} \\cong \\frac{Z_d + C_{d,1}}{B_d + C_{d,1}} \\oplus \\frac{Z_d \\cap C_{d,1}}{B_d \\cap C_{d,1}}$$ holds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps more precise assumptions are needed. For instance, since it's a filtered chain complex, the differential ∂ respects the filtration. So, ∂(C_{d,1}) ⊆ C_{d-1,1}. That is an important condition because otherwise the boundary map wouldn't interact properly with the filtration.\n\nTherefore, another assumption:\n\n- The differential ∂_d maps C_{d,1} into C_{d-1,1}.\n\nThis is crucial because otherwise, the intersections and sums with C_{d,1} might not be well-behaved with respect to the boundary maps.\n\nBut the original problem statement doesn't explicitly mention this, but since it's a filtered chain complex, this is generally part of the definition. So maybe including that as an assumption.\n\nThus, the assumptions would be:\n\n- C_• is a filtered chain complex with filtration C_{•,1} ⊆ C_•,\n- The differential ∂_d satisfies ∂_d(C_{d,1}) ⊆ C_{d-1,1},\n- Z_d = ker(∂_d: C_d → C_{d-1}),\n- B_d = im(∂_{d+1}: C_{d+1} → C_d),\n- All considered quotient spaces are vector spaces.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$\\frac{Z_d}{B_d} \\cong \\frac{Z_d + C_{d,1}}{B_d + C_{d,1}} \\oplus \\frac{Z_d \\cap C_{d,1}}{B_d \\cap C_{d,1}}$$ as vector spaces.\n\nBut the user's confusion also extended to other parts, but according to the instructions, we need to filter the problem to the main one. The user's primary question is about the validity of that isomorphism. The other parts about E^1 pages and boundary maps ∂⁰ are additional questions but perhaps separate problems.\n\nHowever, the user's original question title is about the vector space identity from Chow's article. Hence, the main problem is the isomorphism. The other parts are follow-up confusions but might not be part of the structured problem unless necessary.\n\nSo, to strictly follow the example, focus on the main problem. The example only included the problem statement with assumptions. Hence, the answer should structure the main problem with its assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the final structured problem would have assumptions about the filtered chain complex, cycles, boundaries, and the filtration subgroup. The problem is to prove the given isomorphism.",
