    "Content": "Let $\\mu$ be a measure on $(X,\\mathcal A)$ and let $f, f_1, f_2,\\dots$ and $g, g_1, g_2,\\dots $be real valued $\\mathcal A$- measureable functions on $X$. Show that if $\\mu$ is finite, $(f_n)$ convergence to $f$ in measure and $(g_n)$ to $g$ in measure, then $(f_ng_n)$ convergence to $fg$.\nCan the assumption that $\\mu$ is finite be omitted? Intuitively it feels like one could look at the measure of the union where the convergence does not hold, for $f_n$ and $g_n$. Is that correct or what should I do?\nAnd what about the finiteness of $\\mu$?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Finiteness of $\\mu$ is needed: take $f_n(x):=\\frac 1n\\chi_{(0,n)}$ and $g(x)=g_n(x)=x$ where $\\mu$ is the Lebesgue measure on the real line. Indeed, $f_n\\to 0=:f$ in measure because for a fixed $\\varepsilon$ , for $n\\gt 1/\\varepsilon+1$ , the set $\\left\\{x\\in\\mathbb R, \\left\\lvert f_n(x)\\right\\rvert\\gt \\varepsilon\\right\\}$ is empty. But it is not true that $f_ng_n\\to 0$ in measure; for $\\varepsilon=1/2$ , $$\n\\left\\{x\\in\\mathbb R, \\left\\lvert (f_ng_n)(x)\\right\\rvert\\gt 1/2\\right\\}\n\\supset \\left(\\frac n2,n\\right).$$ When $\\mu$ is finite, fix $\\varepsilon>0$ . There is $A>0$ such that $\\mu\\left\\{|f|>A\\right\\}+\\mu\\left\\{|g|>A\\right\\}<\\varepsilon$ . Then write $$\\left\\{|f_ng_n-fg|>2\\delta^2\\right\\}\\subset\\left\\{|f_n-f|\\cdot |g_n|>\\delta^2\\right\\}\\cup\\left\\{|f|\\cdot|g_n-g|>\\delta^2\\right\\}.$$ We can intersect over $\\left\\{|f|<A\\right\\}\\cap \\left\\{|g|<A\\right\\}$ (its complement has a small measure). More precisely, let $B:=\\left\\{|f|<A\\right\\}\\cap \\left\\{|g|<A\\right\\}$ . Then $$\\mu\\left\\{|f_ng_n-fg|>2\\delta^2\\right\\}\\leqslant \\mu(B^c)+\\mu(\\left\\{|f_n-f|\\cdot |g_n|>\\delta^2\\right\\}\\cap B)+\\mu(\\{|f|\\cdot|g_n-g|>\\delta^2\\}\\cap B).$$ Since $\\left\\{|f|\\cdot|g_n-g|>\\delta^2\\right\\}\\cap B\\subset \\left\\{A\\cdot |g_n-g|\\gt\\delta^2 \\right\\}\\cap B\\subset  \\left\\{A\\cdot |g_n-g|\\gt\\delta^2 \\right\\}$ , the third term is not problematic. For the second one, notice that \\begin{align}\n\\mu\\left(\\left\\{\\left|f_n-f\\right|\\cdot \\left|g_n\\right|>2\\delta^2\\right\\}\\cap B\\right) &\\leqslant\\mu\\left\\{|f_n-f|\\cdot |g_n-g|>\\delta^2\\right\\}+\\mu\\left(\\left\\{\\left|f_n-f\\right|\\cdot |g|>\\delta^2\\right\\}\\cap B\\right)\\\\\n&\\leqslant \\mu\\{\\left|f_n-f\\right|>\\delta\\}+\\mu\\{|g_n-g|>\\delta\\}+\\mu\\left\\{\\left|f_n-f\\right|>\\delta^2/A\\right\\}.\n\\end{align}",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format, listing assumptions line by line and then stating the problem. Let me start by reading the original question carefully.\n\nThe title is \"Convergence in measure of products\". The question has two parts. First, to show that if μ is a finite measure, and sequences f_n and g_n converge in measure to f and g respectively, then the product f_n g_n converges in measure to fg. Second, whether the finiteness of μ can be omitted. The user also mentions an intuitive approach about the measure of the union where convergence fails and asks about the necessity of the finite measure assumption.\n\nFirst, I need to extract all the assumptions. The problem states that μ is a measure on (X, A), and f, f_n, g, g_n are real-valued measurable functions. The key assumptions here are:\n\n1. μ is a finite measure.\n2. (f_n) converges to f in measure.\n3. (g_n) converges to g in measure.\n\nEach of these should be listed as separate assumptions. The problem then is to show that (f_n g_n) converges to fg in measure. The second part is a follow-up question about the necessity of the finite measure assumption. However, according to the format provided in the example, the main problem should be the first part, and the second part might be considered a separate question. But the user's example included an assumption about n being divisible by 7, which was part of the original problem. Here, the user is asking whether the finite measure assumption can be omitted, so perhaps that is part of the problem statement. Wait, but in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. However, the formatted problem only included the divisibility by 7. Wait, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem listed n is an integer and n divisible by 7. Wait, no. Wait, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" The formatted assumption was \"$n$ is an integer, $n$ is divisible by $7$.\" But that seems incorrect because the original problem's assumption is that n is any integer, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe there was a mistake in the example? Because the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7, but the formatted problem included that. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect. Wait, let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem example: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91. The formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove A(n) is divisible by 91. But 91 is 7*13, so maybe the original problem required n to be such that 7 divides it, but the example might have a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the example was structured to include assumptions from the problem, but in the original problem, the only assumption was that n is an integer, but the formatted problem added an extra assumption. Hmm, maybe there was a mistake in the example. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instruction, which says that each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo in the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- μ is a finite measure on (X, A).\n\n- f, f_n are real-valued measurable functions.\n\n- g, g_n are real-valued measurable functions.\n\n- (f_n) converges to f in measure.\n\n- (g_n) converges to g in measure.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, it's given that μ is a measure on (X, A), and all functions are measurable. So the first assumption is μ is a measure on (X, A). Then, the functions f, f_n, g, g_n are real-valued and A-measurable. Then, μ is finite. Then, f_n converges to f in measure, g_n converges to g in measure.\n\nSo breaking it down:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- μ is a measure on (X, A).\n\n- f, f_n, g, g_n are real-valued A-measurable functions on X.\n\n- μ is finite.\n\n- (f_n) converges to f in measure.\n\n- (g_n) converges to g in measure.\n\nProblem: Show that (f_n g_n) converges to fg in measure.\n\nThen, the second part is whether the finiteness of μ can be omitted. But according to the example, the formatted problem only includes the main problem and its immediate assumptions. The follow-up question about omitting the finiteness is probably part of the problem statement but perhaps as a secondary question. However, the user's instruction says to structure the problem as per the format, which in the example only included the main problem. So perhaps the formatted problem here should have the main problem as \"Show that (f_n g_n) converges to fg in measure\" under the given assumptions, and the second part is a separate question. But the original problem includes both parts: showing convergence under finite measure and whether the assumption can be omitted. However, the example provided by the user includes only one problem per formatted block. Therefore, perhaps the second question (about omitting finiteness) is part of the problem statement. Alternatively, the problem might be split into two parts. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nOriginal problem: \"Show that if μ is finite, (f_n) convergence to f in measure and (g_n) to g in measure, then (f_n g_n) convergence to fg. Can the assumption that μ is finite be omitted? Intuitively it feels like one could look at the measure of the union where the convergence does not hold, for f_n and g_n. Is that correct or what should I do? And what about the finiteness of μ?\"\n\nSo the problem has two parts: first to show the convergence under finite μ, second to ask if finite μ can be omitted. However, in the example, the formatted problem included only the main problem, and the original question had a follow-up which was perhaps omitted. But since the user's example included an original problem where the formatted problem was just the main one, maybe here we should structure the first part as the main problem with assumptions, and the second part as a separate question. However, the user's instruction says to structure \"the problem\" as per the format. If the original question has two parts, perhaps both should be included. But in the example, the original problem was only the first part, and the formatted problem included that. Wait, the example's original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n...\", but the formatted problem had an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, perhaps the example was incorrect, but I have to follow the user's instruction regardless.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's example had a mistake, but the correct way is to extract all assumptions from the problem. The problem here says: Show that if μ is finite, (f_n) converges to f in measure, and (g_n) converges to g in measure, then (f_n g_n) converges to fg in measure. Then asks if the finite μ can be omitted.\n\nSo in the formatted problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- μ is a finite measure on (X, A).\n\n- f, f_1, f_2, ... are real-valued A-measurable functions.\n\n- g, g_1, g_2, ... are real-valued A-measurable functions.\n\n- (f_n) converges to f in measure.\n\n- (g_n) converges to g in measure.\n\nProblem: Show that (f_n g_n) converges to fg in measure.\n\nThen, the second question is whether the finiteness of μ can be omitted. But according to the example, the formatted problem only includes the main problem and its assumptions. So perhaps the second part is a separate problem. However, the user's original problem includes both parts. Therefore, maybe the formatted problem should include the second question as part of the problem statement. But in the example, only the main problem was formatted. Alternatively, perhaps the second question is part of the problem. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem listed assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, then the problem to prove divisibility by 91. But 91 is 7*13, so if n is divisible by 7, then 5^n is congruent to 0 mod 7, but maybe that example was incorrect. But regardless, the user wants to structure the given problem into assumptions and problem.\n\nIn the current case, the problem is to show convergence in measure of the product under finite μ, and then ask if μ can be infinite. So the main problem is the first part, with the assumption of finite μ, and the second part is a follow-up question. But according to the user's example, perhaps only the first part is included in the formatted problem. However, the user's instruction says to structure \"the problem\" as per the example. The original problem includes both parts. But the example given by the user seems to have taken only the main problem. However, in the example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n...\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. That seems like an error. Perhaps the user made a mistake in the example, but we have to follow the intended structure.\n\nAssuming that the main problem is the first part, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- μ is a finite measure on (X, A).\n\n- f, f_n are real-valued A-measurable functions.\n\n- g, g_n are real-valued A-measurable functions.\n\n- (f_n) converges to f in measure.\n\n- (g_n) converges to g in measure.\n\nProblem: Show that (f_n g_n) converges to fg in measure.\n\nThen, the second question is separate. But according to the user's example, perhaps the second part is not included in the formatted problem. However, the original question includes both parts. Therefore, perhaps the formatted problem should include the second question as part of the problem. But in the example, only the main problem was formatted. This is a bit confusing. The user's instruction says: \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format\". So perhaps the entire problem, including the second question, should be formatted. However, the example only included one problem. Alternatively, maybe the second question is considered a separate problem and not included. But in the original question, the user is asking both to show the convergence under finite μ and whether the finiteness can be omitted. Therefore, perhaps the formatted problem should include both parts. However, the example only included the first part. To resolve this, I think the user's example might have been incorrect, but we should follow the instruction to list all assumptions of the main problem. The main problem here is to show convergence under finite μ, so the assumptions are:\n\n- μ is a finite measure on (X, A).\n\n- All functions f, f_n, g, g_n are real-valued and A-measurable.\n\n- f_n converges to f in measure.\n\n- g_n converges to g in measure.\n\nProblem: Show that f_n g_n converges to fg in measure.\n\nThe second question is whether μ being finite can be omitted. This is an additional question, but according to the example, perhaps it's considered part of the problem. However, in the example, the formatted problem only had the main question. Therefore, perhaps the formatted problem here should only include the main problem with its assumptions, and the second question is separate. But the user's original problem includes both, so maybe the formatted problem should include both. Alternatively, the user might want to structure each part as a separate problem, but there's no example for that. Given the uncertainty, but following the example provided, I will structure the main problem and list the assumptions, and include the second question as part of the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps the problem statement is the first part, and the second part is a follow-up, but according to the user's example, it's not included. Therefore, I will proceed with the main problem.",
