    "Content": "This one comes from Folland, Real Analysis, Problem 33 in the section titled Modes of Convergence. Suppose $f_n \\geq 0$ and $f_n \\rightarrow f$ in measure, then $\\int f \\leq \\liminf \\int f_n$. So I notice a few things first off, that since $f_n \\to f$ in measure, we can find a subsequence $f_{n_j}$ which converges pointwise almost everywhere (Theorem 2.30 in Folland), and for this subsequence we may say (by Fatou's lemma using $f_n \\geq 0$) that $\\int f \\leq \\liminf \\int f_{n_j}$, but it's not necessarily true that $\\liminf \\int f_{n_j} \\leq \\liminf \\int f_n$, or at least I don't see how to prove it (and in general this is not true for any sequence and subsequence, while the reverse inequality is, I think). Any tips, hints, or solutions?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You can pass to a subsequence $f_{n_k}$ with $\\int f_{n_k} \\to \\liminf \\int f_n$ first. This subsequence will also converge to $f$ in measure and ... then you already know what to do.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me read through the original question carefully.\n\nThe user is working on Problem 33 from Folland's Real Analysis, section on Modes of Convergence. The problem states: Suppose \\( f_n \\geq 0 \\) and \\( f_n \\rightarrow f \\) in measure, then \\( \\int f \\leq \\liminf \\int f_n \\).\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions one by line, each addressing only one property or condition applied to one object. Let me parse the problem statement.\n\nAssumption 1: Each \\( f_n \\) is a non-negative function. That's \\( f_n \\geq 0 \\) for all n.\n\nAssumption 2: The sequence \\( f_n \\) converges to \\( f \\) in measure.\n\nProblem: Prove that the integral of \\( f \\) is less than or equal to the liminf of the integrals of \\( f_n \\), i.e., \\( \\int f \\leq \\liminf \\int f_n \\).\n\nWait, the example given had an assumption where n was an integer and another assumption that n is divisible by 7. Each assumption is a single condition per line. So in this case, the two assumptions are non-negativity of each \\( f_n \\) and convergence in measure to \\( f \\). The problem is the inequality involving the integral.\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is a separate line. Let me check the example again. In the example, the assumptions are listed as two separate lines: \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by $7$\". So each line is a separate condition.\n\nIn the current problem, the two main assumptions are:\n\n1. For each \\( n \\), \\( f_n \\geq 0 \\).\n\n2. \\( f_n \\rightarrow f \\) in measure.\n\nThese are two separate conditions, each applied to the sequence \\( f_n \\). So each should be a separate line in the assumptions.\n\nThe problem is then to prove the integral inequality. So the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nEach \\( f_n \\) is non-negative,\n\\( f_n \\) converges to \\( f \\) in measure.\n\nProblem:\nProve that \\( \\int f \\leq \\liminf \\int f_n \\).\n\nI need to write this in the specified format. Let me check if there's any other implicit assumptions. The problem is about functions in measure space, but since it's from Folland, the standard assumptions of measure theory apply, but the user might not need to list those unless specified. The problem statement doesn't mention the measure space being finite or sigma-finite, so maybe there's no additional assumptions needed beyond what's given.\n\nThe user also mentioned in their question that they considered using a subsequence converging a.e. via Theorem 2.30 and applying Fatou's lemma, but they were stuck on connecting the liminf of the subsequence to the original sequence. But that's part of their thought process, not part of the problem's assumptions. So I don't need to include that in the formatted problem.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem should have two assumptions and the problem statement as given.",
