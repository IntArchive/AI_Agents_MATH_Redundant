    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should list each condition applied to one object, line by line. Then, the problem is restated clearly.\n\nLooking at the original problem here, the title is about proving a hypergeometric function identity. The question mentions numerical observation, matching digits, and some transformations. There are two forms of the hypergeometric function presented, and a related problem about proving another equality between different hypergeometric functions.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem is asking to prove an equality involving the hypergeometric function _2F_1 with specific parameters and argument. The parameters are (1/6, 2/3) and 5/6, and the argument is 80/81. The proposed value is a product of 3/5, 5^(1/6), and 3^(2/3). Also, there's an equivalent form using a Pfaff transformation, leading to another hypergeometric function with parameters (1/6, 1/6) and 5/6, argument -80. Another related problem involves equating this to another hypergeometric function with different parameters.\n\nBut according to the example, assumptions should be properties or conditions applied to one object each. However, in the original problem, the user is asking to prove an identity, so the assumptions would be the parameters and the argument of the hypergeometric function. Let me check the example again. In the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the hypergeometric function's parameters and argument are given, so perhaps those are part of the problem statement, not assumptions. Wait, maybe there are no explicit assumptions here besides the parameters given. The problem is to prove that the function with those parameters equals the given expression. So perhaps the assumptions are the parameters of the hypergeometric function. But in the example, the user had to list the assumptions of the problem. For instance, in the original example, the user had an assumption that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7, but the problem as stated in the example only includes n being an integer, and the assumption added n divisible by 7. Wait, actually, in the original problem in the example, the user wrote \"Prove that for every integer n...\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That suggests that maybe the user modified the problem? Wait, perhaps in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps the example is showing that the user restructured the problem by adding assumptions. Maybe the original problem had an error, or the answerer needed to make an assumption. Alternatively, maybe the example is showing how to extract assumptions from the original problem. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n...\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". So the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That suggests that maybe the original problem had an error, and the answerer corrected it by adding that assumption. But how does that relate to the current task?\n\nIn the current problem, the user is asking to structure the Math Stack Exchange question into the format. The original question states that the identity was found numerically and matches 100 digits. They are asking how to prove it and mention related problems. The assumptions here would be the parameters of the hypergeometric function and the argument. However, in the example, the assumptions were about the variable (n being integer and divisible by 7). Here, the problem is about an identity, so perhaps there are no explicit assumptions beyond the parameters given. But maybe the hypergeometric function's convergence? The argument is 80/81, which is less than 1 in absolute value, so the hypergeometric series converges. But perhaps that's part of the problem's inherent conditions. Alternatively, maybe the assumptions are that the parameters are as given: a=1/6, b=2/3, c=5/6, and z=80/81. But in the problem statement, those are given, so perhaps they don't need to be listed as assumptions. Wait, the example listed assumptions that were part of the problem's conditions. Wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", so the formatted problem's assumption was \"n is an integer\" (which is given) and added \"n is divisible by 7\" (which wasn't in the original). So maybe in the example, there was an error, and the assistant corrected it by adding an assumption. But how does that apply here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original example had a mistake, and the user structured it with additional assumptions. Hmm. The original problem in the example was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which would make the problem different. That seems odd. Perhaps the example is incorrect. Wait, maybe the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 when n is divisible by 7, but the user presented it as \"for every integer n\". But the example's formatted problem adds that assumption. That suggests that maybe the assistant needs to extract implicit assumptions. However, in the current problem, there's no variable like n; it's a specific value. The question is to prove an identity for a specific hypergeometric function evaluated at a specific argument. Therefore, the assumptions would be the parameters of the hypergeometric function. However, since the problem is to prove that the hypergeometric function with those parameters and argument equals a certain value, maybe there are no separate assumptions beyond the given parameters. But perhaps the problem assumes convergence or that the parameters satisfy certain conditions for the hypergeometric function to be defined. For example, the hypergeometric function _2F_1(a,b;c;z) is defined for |z| < 1 or z = 1 with certain conditions on the parameters. Here, z is 80/81, which is less than 1, so it's within the radius of convergence. The parameters are 1/6, 2/3, and 5/6. The denominator parameter c=5/6, which is not a non-positive integer, so the function is defined. Therefore, perhaps there are no additional assumptions needed beyond what's given. But the example included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem, so maybe the current task is to list the given conditions as assumptions. Alternatively, perhaps the example was wrong, and the correct way is to list the problem's given conditions as assumptions. For instance, the hypergeometric function's parameters and argument are part of the problem statement, not assumptions. But the example's original problem said \"for every integer n\", which was converted into an assumption \"n is an integer\", which is part of the problem's original statement, not an added assumption. Wait, in the example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n)... is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem lists assumptions: \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" But the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7. So that seems like the formatted problem added an assumption. Maybe the example is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the example's original problem had a typo, and the formatted version is correct. But without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps for the current problem, since it's about proving an identity for a specific hypergeometric function with given parameters and argument, the assumptions would be the parameters of the function. However, since the problem statement already includes those parameters, maybe the correct approach is to list them as part of the problem, not assumptions. But the example's format includes assumptions that are part of the problem's conditions. Wait, in the example, the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the assumptions are that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But the original problem stated \"for every integer n\", implying no restriction. So perhaps the example is wrong, and the user intended to structure the problem by extracting conditions from the problem statement. Alternatively, maybe the example's original problem had an error, and the formatted version corrected it by adding the divisibility by 7 assumption. Regardless, for the current problem, the hypergeometric function's parameters and argument are given in the problem statement. The question is to prove the equality. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions are the parameters and the argument. But the example listed assumptions about the variable (n), so in this case, since there's no variable but specific parameters, maybe there are no assumptions. Alternatively, the problem's conditions are already given in the problem statement, so the assumptions section might be empty. But the example required assumptions even when they were part of the problem's original statement. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions should list all the given conditions in the problem. For example, in the current problem, the hypergeometric function has parameters 1/6, 2/3, and 5/6, and the argument 80/81. The problem is to prove it equals the given expression. So perhaps the assumptions are those parameters. But each assumption should be a single property applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\na = 1/6,\nb = 2/3,\nc = 5/6,\nz = 80/81.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the intended approach. The example's assumptions were about the variable's properties. Maybe in this case, since there are no variables but fixed parameters, the problem is as stated. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions section is empty. However, the example shows that even if the problem states \"for every integer n\", the assumption is listed as \"n is an integer\". Therefore, following that logic, even if the problem states parameters, they should be listed as assumptions. Therefore, for the current problem:\n\nAssumption:\nThe hypergeometric function is _2F_1 with parameters 1/6, 2/3,\nThe upper parameter is 5/6,\nThe argument is 80/81.\n\nBut each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So each parameter is listed separately. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe first parameter of the hypergeometric function is 1/6,\nThe second parameter of the hypergeometric function is 2/3,\nThe third parameter (denominator) of the hypergeometric function is 5/6,\nThe argument of the hypergeometric function is 80/81.\n\nBut this seems a bit forced. Alternatively, the problem is to prove the identity given those parameters, so the problem statement already includes those parameters, and the assumptions are inherent. But according to the example, even if the problem states \"for every integer n\", the assumption is \"n is an integer\". So following that, the parameters here would be considered assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about the hypergeometric function's value under those parameters, so the assumptions are the parameters and the argument. Therefore, the formatted problem would list each parameter as an assumption. However, since the problem is to prove the equality given those parameters, they are part of the problem's statement. The example includes an assumption that was part of the problem's statement (n is an integer) and added another (n divisible by 7). But in the current problem, there's no added assumption; it's just the parameters. Therefore, maybe the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nThe hypergeometric function ${_2F_1}$ has parameters $\\tfrac{1}{6}$, $\\tfrac{2}{3}$, and $\\tfrac{5}{6}$,\nThe argument of the hypergeometric function is $\\tfrac{80}{81}$.\n\nBut each assumption should be one line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe first parameter of ${_2F_1}$ is $\\tfrac{1}{6}$,\nThe second parameter of ${_2F_1}$ is $\\tfrac{2}{3}$,\nThe third parameter (denominator) of ${_2F_1}$ is $\\tfrac{5}{6}$,\nThe argument of ${_2F_1}$ is $\\tfrac{80}{81}$.\n\nBut perhaps this is too granular. Alternatively, combining the parameters into one assumption:\n\nAssumption:\nThe hypergeometric function is ${_2F_1}\\left(\\tfrac{1}{6}, \\tfrac{2}{3}; \\tfrac{5}{6}; \\tfrac{80}{81}\\right)$.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption is a single property. So splitting into individual components. Alternatively, maybe the problem as stated doesn't have additional assumptions beyond the function's definition, and the assumptions section is empty. But the example shows that even the problem's given conditions are listed as assumptions. So perhaps in this case, the parameters and argument are the assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to prove the identity, and the assumptions are that the hypergeometric function is defined with those parameters and argument. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nThe hypergeometric function ${_2F_1}$ has upper parameters $\\tfrac{1}{6}$ and $\\tfrac{2}{3}$,\nThe hypergeometric function ${_2F_1}$ has lower parameter $\\tfrac{5}{6}$,\nThe argument of the hypergeometric function is $\\tfrac{80}{81}$.\n\nBut the problem statement already includes all of these. The example's original problem stated \"for every integer n\", which became an assumption \"n is an integer\". Therefore, following that pattern, the parameters and argument here should be listed as assumptions. So each parameter and the argument are separate assumptions. Hence:\n\nAssumption:\nThe first upper parameter of ${_2F_1}$ is $\\tfrac{1}{6}$,\nThe second upper parameter of ${_2F_1}$ is $\\tfrac{2}{3}$,\nThe lower parameter of ${_2F_1}$ is $\\tfrac{5}{6}$,\nThe argument of ${_2F_1}$ is $\\tfrac{80}{81}$.\n\nThen, the problem is to prove that this hypergeometric function equals the given expression. The original problem also mentions an equivalent form using a Pfaff transformation, but perhaps that's part of the problem's exploration, not the main problem. The user is asking how to prove the identity, so the main problem is the first equality. The other forms are alternative representations or related problems.\n\nTherefore, the structured problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe first upper parameter of ${_2F_1}$ is $\\tfrac{1}{6}$,\nThe second upper parameter of ${_2F_1}$ is $\\tfrac{2}{3}$,\nThe lower parameter of ${_2F_1}$ is $\\tfrac{5}{6}$,\nThe argument of ${_2F_1}$ is $\\tfrac{80}{81}$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $${_2F_1}\\left(\\begin{array}c\\tfrac16,\\tfrac23\\\\\\tfrac56\\end{array}\\middle|\\,\\frac{80}{81}\\right) = \\frac{3}{5} \\cdot 5^{1/6} \\cdot 3^{2/3}.$$\n\nAlternatively, since the problem statement includes the parameters in the function, maybe the assumptions are redundant. But following the example, even if the problem states \"for every integer n\", the assumption is listed as \"n is an integer\". Therefore, similarly, the parameters here would be listed as assumptions. Hence, the final formatted problem as per the example's structure.",
