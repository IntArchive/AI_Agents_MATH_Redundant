    "Content": "I want to show that for $\\gcd(a,b) = 1$ $a,b \\in Z$   $\\gcd(a+b, a-b) = 1$ or $\\gcd(a+b, a-b) = 2$ holds. I think the first step should look something like this: $d = \\gcd(a+b, a-b) = \\gcd(2a, a-b)$ From here I tried to proceed with two cases. 1: $a-b$ is even, which leads to $\\gcd(a+b, a-b) = 2$ 2: $a-b$ is odd, which leads to $\\gcd(a+b, a-b) = 1$ My main problem I think is, that I do not know how I should include $\\gcd(a,b) = 1$ in the proof. Any help is appreciated. Thx in advance. Cherio Woltan",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $d$ be a common divisor of $a+b$ and $a-b$ , then $d$ divides their sum $2a$ and difference $2b$ . If a number divides two numbers it also divides their gcd, thus $d$ divides $2\\gcd(a,b) = 2$ . That implies that every divisor (including the greatest common divisor) is a divisor of $2$ . The same argument again in symbols: Let $d \\mid a+b, a-b$ , then $d \\mid (a+b)+(a-b) = 2a$ and $d \\mid (a+b)-(a-b) = 2b$ so $d \\mid \\gcd(2a,2b) = 2$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about proving that the gcd of (a+b) and (a−b) is either 1 or 2, given that gcd(a, b) = 1. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The user mentions that a and b are integers, and their gcd is 1. So, the first assumption is that gcd(a, b) = 1. Then, since a and b are integers, that's another assumption. Wait, but the problem statement says \"a,b ∈ Z\", so that's two separate assumptions: a is an integer, and b is an integer. Also, the gcd(a, b) is 1. Are there any other implicit assumptions? The problem doesn't mention any restrictions on a and b beyond being integers with gcd 1. The user in their attempt considered cases where a−b is even or odd, but those aren't assumptions of the problem, rather part of the proof strategy. So the main assumptions are: a and b are integers, and their gcd is 1.\n\nNow, the problem is to prove that gcd(a+b, a−b) is either 1 or 2. So the problem statement is straightforward once the assumptions are listed. Let me check the example again. In the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions are a and b are integers, gcd(a, b) = 1. Each assumption should be on a separate line, addressing one property or condition for one object. So \"a is an integer\", \"b is an integer\", \"gcd(a, b) = 1\". That seems correct.\n\nI need to make sure there's no other hidden assumption. The problem doesn't specify any particular values for a and b, other than their gcd being 1. So I think that's all. The user in their question mentions trying to use cases based on the parity of a−b, but that's part of their approach, not the problem's assumptions. Therefore, the formatted problem should list the three assumptions as above, and the problem statement as proving the gcd is 1 or 2. Let me double-check the example structure again to ensure consistency. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Here, three assumptions because a and b are separate entities each being integers. That's correct. So I think this should be the structured problem.",
