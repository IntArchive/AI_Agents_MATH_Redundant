    "Content": "A bit more than 20 years ago, the following exercise was assigned to a class as the Christmas holiday exercise. I did search for a while whether it was posted here earlier, and could not find it. I guess I might as well ask it as a New Year's Eve riddle here. It was in German; I hope I can translate it in such a way that its spirit is preserved. Two politicians are arguing who of the two of them is able to give the longest talk, without saying the same thing three times in a row. There is a problem, however, they both do only know 2 words, namely 'but' (B) and 'if' (I). The first one begins 'B', the second one replies 'BI' which is countered by 'BIIB'. The second politician is quite bright, he simply repeats literally the last talk given by the other one, then takes that talk again but interchanges B and I and appends the result of this operation to the first talk. His opponent realizes this strategy and proceeds in the same way. So we get talks $$ B, B\\, I, BI\\, IB, BIIB\\, IBBI, BIIB IBBI\\, IBBIBIIB, ...$$ That is, the $k$ -th talk $T_k$ has length $2^{k-1}$ and coincides with the first half of $T_{k+1}$ . A mathematician comes along, who has not much to contribute, either. But he solves the controversy in a mathematician's manner. He gives a talk $T$ of infinite length, such that the first $2^{k-1}$ words of $T$ agree with $T_k$ . Afterwards (!) he leaves and leaves it to the politicians to prove that in his talk he had never said the same thing three times in a row, to be more precise, nowhere in his talk $T$ exists a segment $S$ of finite length which occurs three times as a sequence $SSS$ in $T$ . How do you prove this? :-)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Ah, a beautiful riddle.\nThe answer is the Thue-Morse sequence .\nDefined as follows:\nStarting with $a(0)$ , $a(n)$ is equal to $B$ if $n$ has an odd number of $1$ s in his binary representation, and $I$ otherwise.\nThe theorem (never saying the same thing thrice in a row) is a special case of \"no overlaps\", where overlap means $xAxAx$ where $x$ is a letter and $A$ is a (possibly empty) string of letters.\nThe proof of \"no overlaps in the Thue-Morse sequence\" is in this paper: http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.0907 .\nIf there is some nonempty string of letters $A$ that's said thrice in a row, $AAA$ , then $A=xB$ where $x$ is the first letter of $A$ and $B$ is the rest of the string ( $B$ might be empty), then there is $AAA=xBxBxB$ , but even $xBxBx$ doesn't appear in the sequence, thus $xBxBxB=AAA$ doesn't appear.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format, separating assumptions and the problem statement. \n\nFirst, I need to read through the original question carefully. The title is about talks using just two words where the same thing isn't said three times in a row. The question describes two politicians creating talks by repeating the last talk, swapping B and I, then appending. The talks start as B, BI, BIIB, etc., each doubling in length. A mathematician creates an infinite talk T where each initial segment matches T_k. The challenge is to prove that T doesn't contain any finite segment SSS (three times in a row).\n\nNow, I need to extract assumptions. Each assumption should be a single condition on one object. Let's see:\n\n1. The talks are composed of two words: 'B' and 'I'.\n2. Each talk T_k has length 2^{k-1}.\n3. The first half of T_{k+1} is T_k.\n4. The second half of T_{k+1} is T_k with B and I swapped.\n5. The infinite talk T is the limit of T_k as k approaches infinity.\n6. The problem requires proving that T contains no three consecutive identical finite segments SSS.\n\nWait, the original problem states that the mathematician's talk T has the first 2^{k-1} words agreeing with T_k. So the construction is such that each subsequent talk is built by appending the previous talk with B/I swapped. So the infinite talk is built through this recursive process. The key assumptions here are the construction method of the talks (each T_k is formed by T_{k-1} followed by its swapped version), the two words used (B and I), and the requirement that there's no substring SSS in T. \n\nI should list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property. Let me check the example again. In the example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The talks are composed of two words: 'B' (but) and 'I' (if).\n- Each talk T_k is constructed by taking the previous talk T_{k-1}, interchanging B and I, and appending it to T_{k-1}.\n- The infinite talk T is the limit of the sequence T_1, T_2, T_3, ..., where each T_k is the first 2^{k-1} words of T.\n- The problem requires proving that in T, there does not exist any finite segment S that appears three times consecutively (SSS).\n\nBut wait, the problem statement also mentions that the second politician's strategy is to repeat the last talk and then append the swapped version. So maybe the construction is T_{k} = T_{k-1} + swap(T_{k-1}). So each talk is the previous one concatenated with its swapped version. The initial talks are B, BI, BIIB, etc. So T_1 is B, T_2 is B followed by I (swap of B), T_3 is T_2 followed by swap(T_2) which is IB, so T_3 is BI IB, but wait in the problem statement, the third talk is BIIB, which seems to be T_3 as BI followed by IB. Wait the user wrote: B, BI, BI IB, BIIB IBBI, etc. Wait, maybe the construction is T_{k+1} = T_k followed by swap(T_k). So each step, you take the previous talk and append its swapped version. Then, the infinite talk T is the limit of these T_k's. \n\nTherefore, the key assumptions would be:\n\n- The talks use two words: 'B' and 'I'.\n- Each talk T_{k} is formed by concatenating T_{k-1} and the result of swapping 'B' and 'I' in T_{k-1}.\n- The infinite talk T is such that the first 2^{k-1} words of T are equal to T_k.\n- The problem requires proving that T does not contain any finite segment S repeated three times consecutively (i.e., SSS does not occur in T).\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is a single line. Let me list them:\n\nAssumption:\nThe talks consist of two words: 'B' and 'I'.\nEach talk T_k is constructed by concatenating T_{k-1} and the swap of 'B' and 'I' in T_{k-1}.\nThe infinite talk T is the limit where each initial segment of length 2^{k-1} matches T_k.\nThe problem requires proving that T contains no three consecutive identical finite segments SSS.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the mathematician's talk T is such that the first 2^{k-1} words agree with T_k. So the infinite talk is built by this recursive process. Therefore, the assumptions should capture the construction rules and the properties needed for the problem. \n\nAlso, the original problem mentions that the second politician's strategy is to repeat the last talk and append the swapped version. So the process is that each T_{k} is T_{k-1} followed by swap(T_{k-1}).\n\nThus, the assumptions:\n\n1. Each talk uses only the words 'B' and 'I'.\n2. The k-th talk T_k is formed by concatenating T_{k-1} and the result of swapping 'B' and 'I' in T_{k-1}.\n3. The infinite talk T has the property that the first 2^{k-1} words of T are equal to T_k.\n4. The problem is to prove that T does not contain any finite sequence S repeated three times consecutively (i.e., SSS does not appear in T).\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. Now, formatting them line by line.\n\nProblem: Prove that in the infinite talk T, there does not exist any finite segment S such that SSS occurs in T.\n\nLet me check if that's accurate. The original problem says: \"nowhere in his talk T exists a segment S of finite length which occurs three times as a sequence SSS in T\". So the problem is to prove that such SSS does not occur.\n\nTherefore, the formatted version should be:\n\nAssumption:\nTalks are composed of two words: 'B' and 'I',\nEach talk T_k is constructed by concatenating T_{k-1} and the swap of 'B' and 'I' in T_{k-1},\nThe infinite talk T is the limit where each initial segment of length 2^{k-1} matches T_k,\nThe problem requires showing that no finite segment S appears three times consecutively in T.\nProblem:\nProve that the infinite talk T contains no three consecutive identical finite segments (i.e., no SSS substring exists in T).\n\nWait, but in the example, the problem part is a direct quote. Maybe I should structure it more precisely.\n\nWait, the example problem was phrased as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" So here, the problem should be a direct statement to prove, based on the assumptions.\n\nSo, the problem part would be: \"Prove that in the infinite talk T, there does not exist any finite segment S such that SSS occurs in T.\"\n\nBut to match the example's style, perhaps more precise wording from the original problem. The original problem states: \"nowhere in his talk T exists a segment S of finite length which occurs three times as a sequence SSS in T.\" So maybe the problem line is: \"Prove that nowhere in the infinite talk T exists a finite segment S such that SSS occurs in T.\"\n\nBut maybe to make it concise, similar to the example.\n\nAlternatively, using the exact wording: \"Prove that in his talk T there exists no segment S of finite length which occurs three times in a row (i.e., SSS does not occur).\"\n\nBut the key is to extract the problem statement from the original text. The original problem says: \"he had never said the same thing three times in a row, to be more precise, nowhere in his talk T exists a segment S of finite length which occurs three times as a sequence SSS in T. How do you prove this?\"\n\nSo the problem is to prove that in T, there is no segment S (finite) such that SSS appears in T.\n\nSo the problem statement in the formatted version would be: \"Prove that in the infinite talk T, there is no finite segment S that occurs three times consecutively (i.e., SSS does not occur).\"\n\nTherefore, putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nThe talks consist of two words: 'B' and 'I',\nEach talk T_k is formed by concatenating T_{k-1} and the result of swapping 'B' and 'I' in T_{k-1},\nThe infinite talk T is constructed such that the first 2^{k-1} words of T are equal to T_k,\nProblem:\nProve that in the infinite talk T, there does not exist a finite segment S such that SSS occurs in T.\n\nYes, that seems to capture the essential parts. Each assumption is a single line addressing one condition. The problem is the specific statement to prove.",
