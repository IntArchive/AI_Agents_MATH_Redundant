    "Content": "Let $(S,\\mathcal B)$ be a compact metric space with the Borel-$\\sigma$-Algebra. Let $\\mathcal M$ be the space of signed Borel measures and $\\mathcal P \\subset \\mathcal M$ the set of probability measures on $(S,\\mathcal B)$. Now we say a sequence of measures $(\\mu_n)_{n\\in\\mathbb N}$ with $\\mu_n\\in \\mathcal M$ for each $n$ converges in the weak*-topology to a measure $\\mu \\in \\mathcal M$ if (I) $\\int fd\\mu_n\\overset{n\\rightarrow\\infty}{\\rightarrow}\\int f d\\mu$ for each countinuous and bounded function $f$ from $S$ to $\\mathbb R$ that vanishes at infinity (since $S$ is compact there aren't unbounded continuous $f$ anyways, and also \"vanishing at infinity\" has no meaning, hence this convergence coincides with the weak convergence of measures). I know that for non-locally-compact sets $S$ the $\\mathcal P$ is not closed in this topology. But several times I stumbled over the restriction non-locally-compact which makes me wonder how to show closedness of $\\mathcal P$ in the compact case, i.e. Question: Why can't there be a $\\mu \\in \\mathcal M\\setminus\\mathcal P$ and a sequence of probability measures $(\\mu_n)_{n\\in\\mathbb N}$ such that (I) holds? What I have tried: If $\\mu\\not\\in\\mathcal P$ then either $\\mu(S)\\neq1$ or there is a set $A\\in\\mathcal B$ such that $\\mu(A)<0$. In the former case choose $f\\equiv1$ and see that (I) cannot be true. In the latter case I think there has to be some open set $U$ such that $\\mu(U)<0$ and then I can take a function $f$ that is strictly positive on $U$ and zero elsewhere, then (I) wouldn't hold either (left side would be zero or greater and right side negative). But I don't know if there really has to be such a set $U$. I already asked a different question regarding the existence of such a set ( Obtaining the measure of a set from a limit of measures of open sets ), but my approach there doesn't work.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $A$ be any Borel set in $S$.  By Lusin's theorem, we can choose a sequence of continuous functions $f_m$ with $f_m \\to 1_A$ $\\mu$-almost everywhere.  Moreover, if we set $g_m = \\max(\\min(f_m, 1), 0)$ then $g_m$ is also continuous, $0 \\le g_m \\le 1$ and $g_m \\to 1_A$ $\\mu$-almost everywhere as well. Since $\\int g_m\\,d\\mu = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\int g_m\\,d\\mu_n$, we have $\\int g_m\\,d\\mu \\ge 0$.  And by dominated convergence, $\\lim_{m \\to \\infty} \\int g_m \\,d\\mu =  \\int \\lim_{m \\to \\infty} g_m \\,d\\mu = \\int \\mathbf 1_A \\,d\\mu = \\mu(A)$.  So $\\mu(A) \\ge 0$, and we conclude that $\\mu$ is a positive measure.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so the user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. Let me start by reading through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe title is about whether the set of probability measures on a compact metric space is weak*-closed. The question body gives more context: the space is a compact metric space with the Borel σ-algebra. They define M as signed Borel measures and P as the subset of probability measures. The convergence is weak*-topology, which here (since S is compact) coincides with weak convergence. The user knows that for non-locally-compact spaces, P isn't closed, but they're asking how to show it's closed in the compact case. Their approach considers two cases: if a limit measure μ isn't in P, either μ(S)≠1 or μ has a negative measure on some set. They tried using f≡1 for the total measure and for the negative part, they considered finding an open set with negative measure and using a function positive on that set. But they are unsure if such an open set exists.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property applied to one object. Let's list the key points:\n\n1. (S, B) is a compact metric space with the Borel σ-algebra.\n2. M is the space of signed Borel measures on S.\n3. P is the subset of M consisting of probability measures.\n4. A sequence μ_n in M converges weak*-ly to μ if the integrals of continuous bounded functions (which, due to compactness, are all bounded and vanishing at infinity isn't an issue) converge.\n5. The problem is to show that P is closed in M under this topology, i.e., if μ_n are in P and converge to μ, then μ must be in P.\n\nWait, the original problem is phrased as: Why can't there be a μ in M\\P and a sequence of probability measures μ_n converging to μ in the weak*-topology? So the user is trying to show P is closed by contradiction.\n\nAssumptions from the problem setup:\n\n- S is a compact metric space.\n- B is the Borel σ-algebra on S.\n- M is the space of signed Borel measures on (S, B).\n- P is the set of probability measures (so elements of M that are non-negative and have total mass 1).\n- The weak*-topology on M is defined by convergence: μ_n → μ iff ∫f dμ_n → ∫f dμ for every continuous bounded function f: S → R. Since S is compact, all continuous functions are bounded, and \"vanishing at infinity\" is irrelevant.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should list each of these points. But according to the example, each assumption is a single line, one property per object. Let me parse them:\n\nAssumption lines:\n\n1. (S, B) is a compact metric space with the Borel σ-algebra.\n2. M is the space of signed Borel measures on (S, B).\n3. P is a subset of M consisting of probability measures.\n4. A sequence μ_n in M converges to μ in the weak*-topology if ∫f dμ_n → ∫f dμ for every continuous bounded function f: S → ℝ.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about the problem's conditions. The original problem in the example had n being an integer and n divisible by 7. So here, the problem's conditions are the setup: compact metric space, weak*-convergence, etc.\n\nWait, the problem is to show that P is closed in the weak*-topology. The user is asking why there can't be a μ not in P and a sequence μ_n in P converging to it. So the problem is to prove that P is closed. The user's approach is considering two cases: total measure not 1 or having a negative set.\n\nBut the problem statement in the formatted version should be concise. The original problem's title is \"Is the set of probability measures on a compact metric space (weak*-)closed?\" So the problem is to determine if P is closed in M under the weak*-topology.\n\nBut the user's specific question is: Why can't there be a μ in M\\P and a sequence μ_n in P such that convergence (I) holds? So they want to show that such a μ cannot exist, hence P is closed.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should list all the given conditions for the problem. Let me structure them:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- (S, B) is a compact metric space with the Borel σ-algebra.\n- M is the space of signed Borel measures on (S, B).\n- P is the subset of M consisting of probability measures.\n- A sequence μ_n in M converges to μ in the weak*-topology if ∫f dμ_n → ∫f dμ for every continuous bounded function f: S → ℝ.\n\nProblem: Prove that P is closed in M under the weak*-topology. Alternatively, as the user phrased it: Why can't there be a μ ∈ M \\ P and a sequence of probability measures (μ_n) such that μ_n converges to μ in the weak*-topology?\n\nBut according to the example, the problem statement should be the actual mathematical problem. The example had \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" Here, the problem is to show P is closed, which is equivalent to showing that the limit of any convergent sequence in P must also be in P.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nProblem: Prove that the set P of probability measures is closed in M under the weak*-topology.\n\nBut in the user's question, they have a more specific approach: if μ is not in P, then either μ(S)≠1 or μ has a negative set. Then they use specific test functions. The problem is essentially showing that if a sequence of probability measures converges weak*-ly to μ, then μ must be a probability measure.\n\nSo maybe the problem is phrased as: Prove that if a sequence of probability measures (μ_n) converges to μ in the weak*-topology, then μ is a probability measure.\n\nBut given the original problem's title, it's about P being closed. So the problem statement can be either way. To fit the example, maybe the problem line is the question title.\n\nBut the example's problem line was the specific statement to prove. Let's check:\n\nOriginal example problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91. The formatted problem was that, with assumptions that n is an integer and n divisible by 7. Wait, but in the example, the user made an error. The original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. Wait, maybe the example is not correct, but the user provided it as their own formatting. So perhaps in their example, they incorrectly added an assumption.\n\nBut regardless, following the user's instruction, the task is to filter the original question into assumptions and problem.\n\nSo for the given problem:\n\nThe key assumptions are the setting: S compact metric, B Borel, M signed measures, P probability measures, convergence defined by weak* (i.e., weak convergence since S is compact). Then the problem is whether P is closed in M under this topology.\n\nSo the assumptions would list all the given structures and definitions. Then the problem is to prove that P is closed.\n\nBut in the original problem, the user mentions that they tried considering two cases: μ(S)≠1 or μ having a negative set. So the problem is to show that such a μ cannot exist, hence P is closed.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- $(S, \\mathcal{B})$ is a compact metric space with the Borel $\\sigma$-algebra,\n- $\\mathcal{M}$ is the space of signed Borel measures on $(S, \\mathcal{B})$,\n- $\\mathcal{P} \\subset \\mathcal{M}$ is the set of probability measures,\n- A sequence $(\\mu_n)$ in $\\mathcal{M}$ converges to $\\mu$ in the weak*-topology if $\\int f \\, d\\mu_n \\to \\int f \\, d\\mu$ for every continuous bounded function $f: S \\to \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $\\mathcal{P}$ is closed in $\\mathcal{M}$ under the weak*-topology.\n\nAlternatively, phrased as the user's specific question: Why can't there exist a $\\mu \\in \\mathcal{M} \\setminus \\mathcal{P}$ and a sequence $(\\mu_n)$ in $\\mathcal{P}$ such that $\\mu_n$ converges to $\\mu$ in the weak*-topology?\n\nBut the problem statement should be concise. The user's own attempt is part of the question but not part of the formatted problem. So the problem is to prove P is closed, which is equivalent to showing that limits of sequences in P must be in P.\n\nSo the final answer should have the assumptions listed as per the structure and the problem statement as per the user's core question.",
