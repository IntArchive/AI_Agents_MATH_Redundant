    "Content": "It is a well known fact that if $A,B\\in M_{n\\times n}(\\mathbb C)$ and $AB=BA$, then $e^Ae^B=e^Be^A.$ The converse does not hold. Horn and Johnson give the following example in their Topics in Matrix Analysis (page 435). Let $$A=\\begin{pmatrix}0&0\\\\0&2\\pi i\\end{pmatrix},\\qquad B=\\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\\\0&2\\pi i\\end{pmatrix}.$$ Then $$AB=\\begin{pmatrix}0&0\\\\0&-4\\pi^2\\end{pmatrix}\\neq\\begin{pmatrix}0&2\\pi i\\\\0&-4\\pi^2\\end{pmatrix}=BA.$$ We have $$e^A=\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}\\frac 1{k!}\\begin{pmatrix}0&0\\\\0&2\\pi i\\end{pmatrix}^k=\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}\\frac 1{k!}\\begin{pmatrix}0^k&0\\\\0&(2\\pi i)^k\\end{pmatrix}=\\begin{pmatrix}e^0&0\\\\0&e^{2\\pi i}\\end{pmatrix}=\\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\\\0&1\\end{pmatrix}.$$ For $S=\\begin{pmatrix}1&-\\frac i{2\\pi}\\\\0&1 \\end{pmatrix},$ we have $$e^B=e^{SAS^{-1}}=Se^AS^{-1}=S\\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\\\0&1\\end{pmatrix}S^{-1}=\\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\\\0&1\\end{pmatrix}.$$ Therefore, $A,B$ are such non-commuting matrices that $e^Ae^B=\\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\\\0&1\\end{pmatrix}=e^Be^A.$ It is clear that $\\pi$ is important in this particular example. In fact, the authors say what follows. It is known that if all entries of $A,B\\in M_n$ are algebraic numbers and $n\\geq 2,$ then $e^A\\cdot e^B=e^B\\cdot e^A$ if and only if $AB=BA.$ No proof is given. How does one go about proving that?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The proof comes from Wermuth's \"Two remarks on matrix exponential\" (DOI 10.1016/0024-3795(89)90554-5 ) It seems to me that it is enough to assume that no two distinct eigenvalues of $A$ or $B$ differ by an integer multiple of $2\\pi i$ (which is true if, but not only if $\\pi$ is transcendental with respect to their entries). This is of course true if $A$ and $B$ have algebraic entries. The basic idea is to somehow reverse the exponential function, and express $A$ and $B$ as power series (in fact, polynomials) in their exponentials. Let $m(\\lambda)=\\prod_j (\\lambda-\\lambda_j)^{\\mu_j}$ be the minimal polynomial of $A$. Then by assumption $e^{\\lambda_j}$ are all different, so by Hermite's interpolation theorem we can find a polynomial $f$ such that for $g=f\\circ \\exp$ we have that $g(\\lambda_j)=\\lambda_j$, and if $\\mu_j>0$, then $g'(\\lambda_j)=1$ and $g^{(l)}(\\lambda_j)=0$ for $2\\leq l< \\mu_j$. Then we have $g(A)=A$ (this part I' don't really see, but apparently it's common knowledge, it's probably a corollary of Jordan's theorem on normal form), but $g(A)=f(e^A)$, so $A=f(e^A)$, and similarly for some polynomial $h$ we have $B=h(e^B)$, so $AB=f(e^A)h(e^B)=h(e^B)f(e^A)=BA$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. The example provided shows that the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object, then the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the original problem here: The title is about a converse of the statement that commuting matrices have commuting exponentials. The question refers to a specific example where matrices A and B don't commute but their exponentials do. Then the authors claim that if all entries of matrices A and B are algebraic numbers and n >= 2, then e^A e^B = e^B e^A implies AB = BA. The user is asking how to prove that.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The key conditions given in the problem are that A and B are n x n matrices with all entries being algebraic numbers, n is at least 2, and the exponentials commute. Each assumption should be a separate line.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- A and B are n×n matrices.\n- All entries of A are algebraic numbers.\n- All entries of B are algebraic numbers.\n- n is an integer greater than or equal to 2.\n- e^A e^B = e^B e^A.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that AB = BA under these conditions.\n\nWait, the original statement in the problem says that if entries are algebraic and n >= 2, then e^A e^B = e^B e^A iff AB = BA. But the question is asking for the proof of this statement. The problem part should be the actual thing to prove. So the problem is to prove that AB = BA given that e^A e^B = e^B e^A, with the assumptions listed.\n\nSo the assumptions are the conditions given: algebraic entries, n >= 2, and the exponentials commuting. The problem is to show that AB equals BA.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is one line, one property per line. So separate the entries for A and B being algebraic, the matrix size condition, etc.\n\nAlso, check if there's any other implicit assumptions. The problem doesn't mention anything else, just the algebraic numbers, matrix size, and commuting exponentials. So that's all.\n\nSo formatted:\n\nAssumption:\nA and B are n×n matrices,\nAll entries of A are algebraic numbers,\nAll entries of B are algebraic numbers,\nn is an integer greater than or equal to 2,\ne^A e^B = e^B e^A.\n\nProblem:\nProve that AB = BA.\n\nThat should cover it. Let me double-check the example given by the user. In their example, the assumption listed two things: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Then the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. Here, the assumptions are the conditions on the matrices and the commutativity of exponentials, leading to the conclusion of AB=BA. Yes, that seems right.",
