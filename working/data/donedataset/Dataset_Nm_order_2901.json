    "AcceptedAnswer": "All you need is to prove that $\\Bbb Q$ and $\\mathbb R\\setminus\\mathbb Q$ are dense in $\\Bbb R$. This means (equivalently) that for every pair of reals $x,y$ there exist $r\\in\\Bbb Q$ and $\\ell \\in \\Bbb R\\setminus \\Bbb Q$ such that $$x<r<y$$ and $$x<\\ell<y$$ For the first, I give you some hints: Hover over the grey areas for extra, possibly spoiling, hints. $(1)$ Assume that $y-x>1$. Prove there exists an integer $m$ between $x,y$ Look at $\\lfloor x\\rfloor +1$. $(2)$ Now, let $x,y$ be such that $y-x>0$. The archimedean property of $\\Bbb R$ means that  there exists $n$ such that $n(y-x)=ny-nx>1$. Use $(1)$ There exists an integer $m$ between $ny,nx$, from where $nx<m<ny$ or $$x<\\frac m n z y$$ and we have found our rational number. $(3)$ Here, we might use that, say $\\sqrt 2$ is irrational. Then since $\\sqrt 2 <2$, $\\frac{\\sqrt 2}2<1$. Then we start with an irrational $\\mu\\in(0,1)$. Given two rationals, $r,s$ with $r-s>0$, we have that $$0<\\mu(r-s)<r-s$$ so that $$s<s+\\mu(r-s)<r$$ It suffices to prove that $s+\\mu(r-s)$ is irrational. Can you do this? All the above proves that $\\Bbb Q$ and $\\Bbb R\\setminus \\Bbb Q$ are dense in $\\Bbb R$. Can you see why? Now, if I give you an irrational (or irrationals) $\\lambda$, look at the intervals of the form $$\\left(\\alpha-\\frac 1 n,\\alpha +\\frac 1n \\right)$$ and build a sequence of rationals (resp. irrationals) converging to $\\alpha$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. The example they provided involved listing each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object, and then stating the problem.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question correctly. The question is asking to prove two things: \n\n1. Every irrational number is the limit of a sequence of rational numbers.\n2. Every rational number is the limit of a sequence of irrational numbers.\n\nSo, the problem has two parts. Now, I need to list the assumptions. The original problem doesn't explicitly state many assumptions, but in math problems, there are often implicit assumptions. Let's think about the first part: showing that an irrational number can be approximated by rationals. The key here is that the real numbers are considered, specifically irrationals in ℝ. Similarly, for the second part, rational numbers in ℝ are considered. \n\nWait, the problem statement already mentions \"every irrational number in ℝ\" and \"every rational number in ℝ\". So maybe the main assumption here is that we're dealing with real numbers. But in the example provided, the assumptions were about the variable n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, maybe the assumptions are about the properties of the numbers involved. Let me check.\n\nFor the first part, the assumption is that the number is irrational and a real number. For the second part, the number is rational and a real number. But the problem statement already includes these conditions. However, in the example, the assumption included \"n is an integer\" which was part of the original problem's statement. The user's example extracted the assumptions from the problem's given conditions. \n\nSo in this case, the assumptions would be:\n\n- x is an irrational number.\n- x is a real number.\n- y is a rational number.\n- y is a real number.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"every irrational number in ℝ\" and \"every rational number in ℝ\", so perhaps the key is to break down each condition. However, the example had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n\". Wait, maybe in the example, the user made a mistake? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should just be that n is an integer. But in the example, they added \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut wait, that seems incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", not necessarily divisible by 7. So maybe the user who made the example added an extra assumption that wasn't in the original problem? Or perhaps there was a mistake in the example. Hmm. This is confusing. Maybe the example is incorrect, but the user still wants me to follow their format, even if there are discrepancies. So perhaps in their example, they extracted assumptions beyond what's stated. Alternatively, maybe the problem had an error, and the correct assumption was that n is divisible by 7, but the problem statement didn't mention it. I need to proceed carefully.\n\nIn the current problem, the user wants to structure the problem into Assumption and Problem sections. The original problem is about proving that every irrational real is the limit of a sequence of rationals, and every rational real is the limit of a sequence of irrationals. So the assumptions here would be:\n\nFor the first part: The number in question is an irrational real number. For the second part: The number is a rational real number. So each part has its own assumption. Since the problem is two separate statements, each with their own condition, the assumptions should list both conditions. However, in the example, the problem was a single statement with two assumptions listed. So perhaps here, the assumptions should list the two premises separately.\n\nTherefore, the Assumption section would be:\n\n- x is an irrational number,\n- x is a real number,\n- y is a rational number,\n- y is a real number.\n\nBut since \"x is a real number\" and \"y is a real number\" are redundant because the problem already states \"in ℝ\", maybe we can simplify. The problem states \"every irrational number in ℝ\" and \"every rational number in ℝ\", so the key assumptions are that x is an irrational real and y is a rational real. However, in the example, even though the problem said \"for every integer n\", the assumption was listed as \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the original example problem, the problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect unless the original problem had a typo. Maybe the original problem required n to be divisible by 7, but the user made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the example is wrong, but the user still wants to follow that format, even if the example is flawed.\n\nGiven that the user provided that example, perhaps they want to list each condition separately, even if they are part of the same object. So for the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- x is an irrational number,\n- x is in ℝ,\n- y is a rational number,\n- y is in ℝ.\n\nBut since the problem states \"every irrational number in ℝ\" and \"every rational number in ℝ\", perhaps the key assumptions are just that x is an irrational real and y is a rational real. So each part of the problem (the two statements) has its own assumption. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. x is an irrational number in ℝ.\n2. y is a rational number in ℝ.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So breaking these down:\n\nFor the first part:\n\n- x is an element of ℝ,\n- x is irrational.\n\nFor the second part:\n\n- y is an element of ℝ,\n- y is rational.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be listed as four separate lines? Wait, but the example had two assumptions for a single problem. In the original example, the problem was about proving A(n) divisible by 91 for every integer n, and the formatted assumptions were \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like the problem might have required n to be divisible by 7, but the original problem stated \"for every integer n\". This inconsistency suggests that maybe the example was incorrect. However, the user provided it, so perhaps they want to split the conditions even if they're part of the same object.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the original problem, the user made a mistake in the example, but the key idea is to list each condition as a separate assumption. So applying that here, the problem has two parts, each with their own conditions.\n\nBut the problem as stated in the original question is two separate statements, each with their own condition. So perhaps the assumptions should be:\n\nFor the first problem (irrational limit):\n\n- x is an irrational number,\n- x is a real number.\n\nFor the second problem (rational limit):\n\n- y is a rational number,\n- y is a real number.\n\nBut in the example, the problem was a single statement with two assumptions. Here, the problem is two separate statements. However, the user wants the problem to be structured into one \"Problem\" section. The original problem is phrased as two sentences but is considered one problem. So the formatted problem would list both parts.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- x is an irrational real number,\n- y is a rational real number.\n\nBut each assumption line is supposed to address only one property or condition applied to one object. Therefore, breaking them into:\n\n- x is an element of ℝ,\n- x is irrational,\n- y is an element of ℝ,\n- y is rational.\n\nBut maybe that's overkill. Alternatively, since the problem mentions \"every irrational number in ℝ\" and \"every rational number in ℝ\", the key is that x and y are real numbers with respective rationality properties. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- x is an irrational number in ℝ,\n- y is a rational number in ℝ.\n\nBut according to the example's format, each assumption is a separate line. So each of these would be two separate assumptions. So:\n\nAssumption:\nx is an irrational number,\nx is in ℝ,\ny is a rational number,\ny is in ℝ.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, x and y are not introduced as separate variables. The problem states two separate parts: first about irrationals, then about rationals. So perhaps the problem is two parts, each with their own assumptions. However, the user wants the problem structured into one problem block. Hence, the problem is to show both statements, and the assumptions are the premises for each statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considered one problem with two parts, and the assumptions are the two premises. But in the example, even though the problem was a single statement, the assumptions were split into two lines. So following that, here the assumptions would be:\n\n- Every irrational number in ℝ is considered,\n- Every rational number in ℝ is considered.\n\nBut that's not precise. Alternatively, maybe each object (each number) has two properties: being in ℝ and being irrational/rational. So each assumption line would be:\n\nFor the first part:\n\n- Let x be an irrational number,\n- x is a real number.\n\nFor the second part:\n\n- Let y be a rational number,\n- y is a real number.\n\nBut since the problem is presented as two separate statements, perhaps the assumptions should be separated accordingly. However, the user's example combined multiple assumptions into one problem. Therefore, perhaps in this case, the assumptions are:\n\n- x is an irrational real number,\n- y is a rational real number.\n\nEach on a separate line. Then the problem would be the combined statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem should be split into two problems. But the original question is presented as one problem with two parts. The user's example had one problem with two assumptions. So maybe here, the problem is structured as one problem with two parts, and the assumptions are the conditions for each part.\n\nBut to adhere strictly to the example's format, where the original problem was one statement but the assumptions were split into two lines (n is integer, n divisible by 7), even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n\", which doesn't require divisibility by 7. This suggests that maybe the example is flawed, but the user still wants the same approach.\n\nGiven that, perhaps for the current problem, even though the problem states \"every irrational number in ℝ\" and \"every rational number in ℝ\", the assumptions should be split into:\n\n- The number is irrational,\n- The number is a real number,\n- The number is rational,\n- The number is a real number.\n\nBut this seems redundant because \"in ℝ\" is already specified. However, to follow the example's approach, which split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" (even if the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7), the user might want to separate \"is irrational\" and \"is in ℝ\" into two assumptions. Therefore, for each number (irrational and rational), we have two assumptions: being in ℝ and being irrational/rational.\n\nThus, the formatted assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nx is an irrational number,\nx is a real number,\ny is a rational number,\ny is a real number.\n\nProblem:\nShow that every irrational number in ℝ is the limit of a sequence of rational numbers and every rational number in ℝ is the limit of a sequence of irrational numbers.\n\nBut the original problem statement uses \"every irrational number in ℝ\" which combines both conditions (being irrational and in ℝ), but according to the example, we split them into separate assumptions. So that's the way to go.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: \nx is an irrational number,\nx is a real number,\ny is a rational number,\ny is a real number.\n\nProblem:\nShow that every irrational number in ℝ is the limit of a sequence of rational numbers and every rational number in ℝ is the limit of a sequence of irrational numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is two separate problems, but the original question presents them as a single problem. However, the user's example had one problem with two assumptions. Therefore, combining both parts into one problem with four assumptions (two for each part).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So each part's assumptions are split into two lines each. Hence, the formatted problem as above.",
