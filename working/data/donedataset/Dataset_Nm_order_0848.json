    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure a problem from Math Stack Exchange into their specified format. The example they provided shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then the problem is restated clearly.\n\nLooking at the given question from Math Stack Exchange:\n\nTitle: $a^n \\equiv 1\\pmod{\\!m}\\!\\iff\\! $ order of $a$ divides $n\\,$ [Order Theorem]\nQuestion: How can I show that the order of an element modulo $m$ divides $\\phi(m)$ ? I know that if $a$ and $m$ are relatively prime, then the least positive integer $x$ such that $a^x\\equiv1\\pmod m$ is its order modulo $m$ . I also know that, by Euler's theorem, $a^{\\phi(m)}\\equiv1\\pmod m$ . Therefore, it must be the case that $x\\leq\\phi(m)$ However, all that I am left to do is to show that $kx=\\phi(m)$ , for some integer $k$ . Do you guys have an idea on how to do this? Thanks in advance!\n\nFirst, I need to parse this and extract the assumptions. The user mentions that the order of an element modulo $m$ divides $\\phi(m)$. The key points here are:\n\n- $a$ and $m$ are relatively prime. That's one assumption because the order is defined when they are coprime.\n- The order of $a$ modulo $m$ is the least positive integer $x$ such that $a^x \\equiv 1 \\mod m$. That's another assumption about the definition of order.\n- Euler's theorem tells us that $a^{\\phi(m)} \\equiv 1 \\mod m$, which is another condition.\n\nBut the problem is to show that the order (which is $x$) divides $\\phi(m)$. The original problem's goal is to connect the order with Euler's totient function. The assumptions needed are the conditions required for the order to exist and for Euler's theorem to hold.\n\nSo, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. $a$ and $m$ are relatively prime integers. (This is necessary for the order to exist and for Euler's theorem to apply.)\n2. The order of $a$ modulo $m$ is the least positive integer $x$ such that $a^x \\equiv 1 \\mod m$. (Defining the order.)\n3. Euler's theorem states that $a^{\\phi(m)} \\equiv 1 \\mod m$. (This is a given theorem that applies here.)\n\nHowever, in the example provided, the assumptions were more about the problem's given conditions. The original question is asking how to show that the order divides $\\phi(m)$, given that they know Euler's theorem and the definition of order. But in the example, the assumptions were properties of the variables in the problem. So maybe the assumptions here are the conditions under which the problem is posed. Since the problem is to show that the order divides $\\phi(m)$, the necessary assumptions are that $a$ and $m$ are coprime (so that the order exists) and that Euler's theorem applies (which requires the same coprimality). So perhaps the main assumptions are just that $a$ and $m$ are coprime. But the user's example had two assumptions: one about $n$ being an integer and another about being divisible by 7. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer $n$, but in the formatted problem, the assumption included that $n$ is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe the example is different. Let me check again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists assumptions as \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem's assumptions include that n is divisible by 7. That might be a mistake, but perhaps the user intended to filter out unrelated information. Wait, maybe the original problem had a mistake, and the user corrected it in the formatted version. Hmm, but that's confusing. Alternatively, maybe in the original problem, there was an implicit assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the user made it explicit. But regardless, for the current problem, I need to follow the user's example.\n\nIn the current problem, the user is asking how to show that the order of an element modulo m divides φ(m). The given information includes that a and m are relatively prime (so that the order exists), the definition of order, and Euler's theorem. The problem is to show that x (the order) divides φ(m).\n\nSo the assumptions here would be:\n\n- a and m are relatively prime integers. (Because if they aren't, the order isn't defined.)\n- The order of a modulo m is the least positive integer x such that a^x ≡ 1 mod m. (This defines the order.)\n- Euler's theorem: a^{φ(m)} ≡ 1 mod m. (Given as known.)\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were more about the problem's conditions rather than definitions or theorems. Wait, in the example, the assumptions were \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". The original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted version added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like an error unless the original problem had a typo. Maybe the example was a mistake, but I should follow the user's instruction regardless.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the example, the user intended to restructure the problem by making implicit assumptions explicit. However, in the current problem, the key assumptions are that a and m are coprime, which is necessary for the order to exist. The rest are definitions or known theorems. But according to the user's example, they included definitions as assumptions. For instance, in the example, the problem was about divisibility by 91, and the assumption included that n is an integer (which was given in the problem) and that n is divisible by 7, which perhaps was part of the problem's conditions. Wait, the original example's problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem's assumptions include that n is divisible by 7, which changes the problem. That might be a mistake in the example. But since the user provided that example, I have to follow their structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in their example. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That would mean the problem is now to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 when n is divisible by 7, which is a different problem. Maybe there was a misunderstanding in the example. However, since the user provided that example, I need to follow their approach even if it's incorrect. But in the current problem, the user's task is to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into assumptions and problem.\n\nThe Math Stack Exchange question is asking how to show that the order of an element modulo m divides φ(m). The user knows that if a and m are coprime, the order exists, and by Euler's theorem, a^{φ(m)} ≡ 1 mod m. They want to show that x (the order) divides φ(m). So the key assumptions here are that a and m are coprime, and the problem is to show that the order divides φ(m). The definitions (like what the order is) are part of the problem's context but may not be listed as assumptions. However, in the user's example, they included definitions as assumptions, like \"$n$ is an integer\" which was part of the original problem's statement.\n\nSo perhaps for this problem, the assumptions should be:\n\n- $a$ and $m$ are relatively prime integers.\n\nBecause that's the condition needed for the order to exist and for Euler's theorem to apply. The other parts are either definitions or known theorems. The problem is to show that the order of $a$ modulo $m$ divides $\\phi(m)$.\n\nWait, the problem is to show that the order divides φ(m), given that a and m are coprime. The original question mentions knowing that the order is the least x with a^x ≡1 mod m, and Euler's theorem gives a^{φ(m)} ≡1 mod m. So the key assumption is the coprimality, and the problem is to prove the divisibility.\n\nIn the user's example, they listed two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. The original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted version added the divisibility by 7. That might be an error, but perhaps the user intended to show that even if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", maybe there was an implicit condition that n is divisible by 7. Alternatively, maybe the example was structured incorrectly. However, for the current problem, I need to proceed.\n\nSo, for the current problem, the main assumption is that $a$ and $m$ are coprime. The problem is to show that the order of $a$ modulo $m$ divides φ(m).\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n$a$ and $m$ are relatively prime integers.\nProblem:\nShow that the order of $a$ modulo $m$ divides $\\phi(m)$.\n\nBut wait, the original question also mentions knowing that the order is the least x such that a^x ≡1 mod m, and Euler's theorem. Should those be listed as assumptions? In the example, the user included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, which were part of the problem's conditions. So perhaps in this case, the assumptions are the necessary conditions for the problem to hold, which is that a and m are coprime, which allows the order to exist and Euler's theorem to apply. The rest are either definitions or theorems that are given.\n\nTherefore, the correct assumptions would be just that a and m are coprime. The problem is to show that the order divides φ(m). So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n$a$ and $m$ are relatively prime integers.\nProblem:\nShow that the order of $a$ modulo $m$ divides $\\phi(m)$.\n\nI think that's it. The key is to list the conditions that are necessary for the problem to be posed, not the definitions or known theorems. So the main assumption is the coprimality of a and m.",
