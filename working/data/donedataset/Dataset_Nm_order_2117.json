    "Content": "I'm reading the introductory bits in Procesi's Lie Groups , and on p. 22 we have (paraphrasing) Theorem 2. $\\mathcal{B}=\\{x_1^{\\large h_1}\\cdots x_n^{\\large h_n}: 0\\le h_k\\le n-k\\}$ is a basis for the ring $\\Bbb Z[x_1,\\dots,x_n]$ considered over $\\Bbb Z[e_1,\\dots,e_n]$ , where $e_i$ are the elementary symmetric polynomials in the $x_i$ . I haven't been able to see why this is true. The previous theorem was the fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials, which was proven inductively with a recursive algorithm: If $x_n\\mid f$ then $x_1\\cdots x_n\\mid f$ , and dividing out we are left with a symmetric polynomial of smaller degree than before. Otherwise, write $f(x_1,\\dots,x_{n-1},0)$ as a polynomial $p$ in the elementary symmetric polynomials $\\hat{e}_i$ of the first $n-1$ variables, $p(\\hat{e}_1,\\dots,\\hat{e}_{n-1})$ . Now the polynomial $$f(x_1,\\dots,x_n)-p(e_1,\\dots,e_{n-1})$$ is symmetric in all of $x_1,\\dots,x_n$ and evaluates to $0$ at $x_n=0$ , i.e., is divisible by $x_n$ . Induct. Is there a straightforward adaptation of this with which we can argue for theorem 2? Or is there perhaps another way to see that it must be true? I feel I am missing something simple here.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I suppose I should actually come back to answer this. Main idea: for $1\\le d<n$ we have $$\\Bbb Z[x_1,\\dots,x_n]^{S_d}=\\bigoplus_{j=0}^d \\Bbb Z[x_1,\\dots,x_n]^{S_{d+1}}x_{d+1}^j. \\tag{$\\circ$}$$ They're both equal to $\\Bbb Z[x_1,\\dots,x_n]^{S_{d+1}}[x_{d+1}]$ . Using $(\\circ)$ we can begin unpeeling $\\Bbb Z[x_1,\\dots,x_n]$ by setting $d=1,2,\\dots,n-1$ . What I found interesting about this argument is that the outer layers of the onion are the smaller indices rather than the larger - initially I believed it'd be the reverse.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, the user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The task is to list the assumptions and the problem statement based on the original question. Let me read through the original problem again carefully.\n\nThe title is about finding a basis for the ring ℤ[x₁,…,xₙ] over ℤ[e₁,…,eₙ], where e_i are elementary symmetric polynomials. The question references Theorem 2 in Procesi's Lie Groups, which states that the set B = {x₁^{h₁}...xₙ^{hₙ} : 0 ≤ h_k ≤ n−k} is a basis. The user is confused about why this is true and mentions the previous theorem, which is the fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials. They describe the proof method using induction and division by x_n, etc. The user is asking if there's a straightforward adaptation of that proof method for Theorem 2 or another way to see it.\n\nNow, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem. Let me parse the key points:\n\nAssumptions would be the conditions given in Theorem 2. The problem is to show that the set B is a basis for ℤ[x₁,…,xₙ] over ℤ[e₁,…,e_n].\n\nLooking at the theorem statement: ℬ is a basis for ℤ[x₁,…,xₙ] over ℤ[e₁,…,eₙ], where e_i are elementary symmetric polynomials. The specific exponents in ℬ are 0 ≤ h_k ≤ n−k for each x_k's exponent.\n\nSo, the assumptions here would be:\n\n1. The ring under consideration is ℤ[x₁,…,xₙ].\n2. The coefficients are from ℤ[e₁,…,eₙ], where e_i are elementary symmetric polynomials in x₁,…,xₙ.\n3. The set ℬ consists of monomials x₁^{h₁}...xₙ^{hₙ} with each h_k satisfying 0 ≤ h_k ≤ n−k.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user is paraphrasing the theorem. The theorem states that ℬ is a basis. The problem is to understand why that is true. However, in the format provided, the user wants to structure the problem as \"Assumption\" and \"Problem\". The example given shows that assumptions are the conditions given (like n is an integer, n divisible by 7), and the problem is the actual statement to prove.\n\nIn the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer (since it's for every integer n), but the formatted version didn't include \"n is an integer\" as an assumption? Wait, no. Wait the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, the assumption was n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the example, the original problem was: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem's assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem didn't state that n must be divisible by 7. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect? Wait, maybe there was a mistake in the example. Wait, let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal problem in the example: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption is \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems conflicting. Because the original problem is for every integer n, but the formatted problem's assumption adds that n is divisible by 7. That can't be. So maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a different condition. Wait, perhaps the example is hypothetical. Maybe the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the problem statement was to prove divisibility by 91. For example, perhaps the original problem required n divisible by 7 to get divisibility by 91 (which is 7*13). But maybe the example is constructed to show that.\n\nBut regardless, the key point is that in the formatted problem, the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem, each addressing one property applied to one object.\n\nSo, for the current problem, the theorem states that ℬ is a basis. The assumptions here are:\n\n- The ring is ℤ[x₁,…,xₙ] considered over ℤ[e₁,…,eₙ], so that's the structure. So the ring is a module over ℤ[e₁,…,eₙ], and the basis is as a module.\n\n- The elementary symmetric polynomials e₁,…,eₙ are in the variables x₁,…,xₙ.\n\n- The set ℬ is defined as monomials x₁^{h₁}…xₙ^{hₙ} with exponents 0 ≤ h_k ≤ n−k for each k.\n\nSo each of these would be separate assumptions. Let me list them:\n\nAssumption:\nThe ring ℤ[x₁,…,xₙ] is considered as a module over ℤ[e₁,…,eₙ],\nEach e_i is an elementary symmetric polynomial in x₁,…,xₙ,\nEach monomial in ℬ has exponents h_k satisfying 0 ≤ h_k ≤ n−k for each k.\n\nBut in the example, each assumption is a separate line. So each bullet point is a separate assumption. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the assumptions were:\n\nn is an integer,\n\nn is divisible by 7.\n\nSo two separate lines. So each is a single condition.\n\nSo for the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. The ring ℤ[x₁,…,xₙ] is considered over ℤ[e₁,…,eₙ].\n\n2. e₁,…,eₙ are elementary symmetric polynomials in x₁,…,xₙ.\n\n3. The set ℬ consists of monomials x₁^{h₁}…xₙ^{hₙ} where each exponent h_k satisfies 0 ≤ h_k ≤ n−k.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the theorem is asserting that ℬ is a basis. So the problem is to prove that ℬ is a basis under these assumptions. Therefore, the problem part would be \"Prove that ℬ is a basis for ℤ[x₁,…,xₙ] over ℤ[e₁,…,eₙ].\"\n\nBut the user's question is more about understanding why this is true, given the previous theorem (fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials). So the problem, as structured, should present the theorem as the problem to be proved, with the assumptions as the given conditions.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nℤ[x₁,…,xₙ] is considered as a module over ℤ[e₁,…,eₙ],\nEach e_i is an elementary symmetric polynomial in x₁,…,xₙ,\nEach monomial in ℬ has exponents h_k satisfying 0 ≤ h_k ≤ n−k for each k.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ℬ is a basis for ℤ[x₁,…,xₙ] over ℤ[e₁,…,eₙ].\n\nWait, but in the example, they separated the assumptions as properties of the objects. For instance, n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Each is a separate condition on n. Similarly, here, perhaps the assumptions should list the properties of each object.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nThe ring ℤ[x₁,…,xₙ] is a module over ℤ[e₁,…,eₙ],\nThe elements e₁,…,eₙ are elementary symmetric polynomials in x₁,…,xₙ,\nEach element of ℬ is a monomial x₁^{h₁}…xₙ^{hₙ},\nFor each monomial in ℬ, the exponents satisfy 0 ≤ h_k ≤ n−k for all k from 1 to n.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ℬ is a basis for ℤ[x₁,…,xₙ] over ℤ[e₁,…,eₙ].\n\nBut perhaps the exponents' condition is part of the definition of ℬ, so the third assumption is that ℬ is defined as the set of monomials with exponents 0 ≤ h_k ≤ n−k. So each of these conditions is an assumption. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The ring ℤ[x₁,…,xₙ] is considered as a module over ℤ[e₁,…,eₙ].\n\n- e₁,…,eₙ are elementary symmetric polynomials in the variables x₁,…,xₙ.\n\n- ℬ is the set of monomials x₁^{h₁}…xₙ^{hₙ} with exponents 0 ≤ h_k ≤ n−k for each k.\n\nSo each of these is a separate line. Then the problem is to prove that this set ℬ is a basis.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nℤ[x₁,…,xₙ] is a module over ℤ[e₁,…,eₙ],\ne₁,…,eₙ are elementary symmetric polynomials in x₁,…,xₙ,\nℬ consists of monomials x₁^{h₁}⋯xₙ^{hₙ} with 0 ≤ h_k ≤ n−k for each k.\nProblem: \nProve that ℬ is a basis for ℤ[x₁,…,xₙ] over ℤ[e₁,…,eₙ].\n###",
