    "Content": "In this Numberphile video it is stated that \"almost all natural numbers have the digit $3$ in their decimal representation\", and a proof of this fact is proposed.\nA sketch of the proof follows: Denote by $D_3$ the set of natural numbers having a digit $3$ in their decimal representation. For all $n \\ge 1$, denote by\n$$f(n) = | D_3 \\cap \\{ 1, \\dots , n\\} |$$\nit is proved that for all $n$\n$$f(10^n) = 10^n- 9^n $$\nholds (and this is quite clear), hence\n$$\\lim_{n \\to + \\infty} \\frac{f(10^n)}{10^n} = 1$$\nand this concludes the proof in the video. Now, this proof is clear and evident to me, but I think that it is incomplete, since we should prove that $$\\lim_{n \\to + \\infty} \\frac{f(n)}{n} = 1$$ while this is not proved in the video. So my question is: how to prove this? EDIT: Obviously, if the limit exists, then it is equal to $1$: so I am asking how to show that the last limit actually exists.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You are correct that proving $\\lim_{n \\to + \\infty} \\frac{f(10^n)}{10^n} = 1$ is not enough.  I can define $g(n)=n$ if $n=10^k$ and $g(n)=0$ otherwise.  I then have $\\lim_{n \\to + \\infty} \\frac{g(10^n)}{10^n} = 1$ but $\\lim_{n \\to + \\infty} \\frac{g(n)}{n}$  does not exist.  We have shown that if $\\lim_{n \\to + \\infty} \\frac{f(n)}{n}$ exists, it is $1$, so all we need now is that it exists.  We can use the same argument.  Define $h(n)=n-f(n)$ as the number of numbers less than $n$ that are missing $3$.  They show $h(10^n)=9^n$.  $h(n)$ is monotonically increasing as when you go from $n$ to $n+1$ you either add $1$ or $0$ to $h$.  Now for any $k$, let $m=\\lfloor \\log_{10}k \\rfloor$ so that $10^m$ is the power of $10$ just below $k$.  $\\frac {f(k)}k =1-\\frac {h(k)}k \\gt 1-\\frac {9^{m+1}}{10^m}\\to 1$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So the user is talking about the theorem that \"almost all natural numbers have the digit 3 in their decimal representation.\" They mention a Numberphile video where they proved that the limit of f(10^n)/10^n as n approaches infinity is 1, where f(n) counts how many numbers up to n have at least one digit 3. But the user points out that this only shows the limit for 10^n, not for all n, and wants to know how to prove that the limit of f(n)/n as n approaches infinity is actually 1. Also, they edited to clarify that they need to show the limit exists in the first place.\n\nFirst, I need to structure the problem according to the given format. Let me parse the original question to extract assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe problem is about proving that the natural density of numbers containing the digit 3 in their decimal representation is 1. The key points from the question are:\n\n- D_3 is the set of natural numbers with a digit 3.\n- f(n) is the count of numbers in D_3 up to n.\n- It's proven that f(10^n) = 10^n - 9^n, so the limit as n approaches infinity for f(10^n)/10^n is 1.\n- The user wants to show that lim_{n→∞} f(n)/n = 1, not just for n being powers of 10.\n\nAssumptions here would include:\n\n1. D_3 is the set of natural numbers with at least one digit '3' in their decimal representation.\n2. For each n ≥ 1, f(n) is defined as the cardinality of D_3 ∩ {1, ..., n}.\n3. It's established that f(10^n) = 10^n - 9^n.\n4. The limit as n approaches infinity of f(10^n)/10^n is 1.\n5. The problem requires proving that the limit of f(n)/n as n approaches infinity exists and equals 1.\n\nWait, but in the example given earlier, the assumptions were specific to the problem's conditions. Here, the main assumptions are definitions: D_3 is numbers with digit 3, f(n) counts them up to n, and the known result for 10^n. The problem is to extend that result to general n.\n\nSo, structuring the assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\n- D₃ is the set of natural numbers containing the digit '3' in their decimal representation.\n- For each integer n ≥ 1, f(n) is the number of elements in D₃ ∩ {1, ..., n}.\n- For all integers n ≥ 1, f(10ⁿ) = 10ⁿ - 9ⁿ.\n- The limit as n approaches infinity of f(10ⁿ)/10ⁿ is 1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the limit of f(n)/n as n approaches infinity exists and is equal to 1.\n\nBut wait, the original problem mentions that the user wants to show that lim_{n→∞} f(n)/n = 1, given that lim_{n→∞} f(10^n)/10^n =1. The user acknowledges that if the limit exists, then it's 1, but they need to show existence. So the problem is twofold: existence of the limit and its value. But the key part here is showing the existence, since the value follows if it exists.\n\nSo the problem is to prove that the natural density of D₃ is 1, which requires showing that the limit exists. So the problem statement should be: Prove that the limit as n approaches infinity of f(n)/n exists and equals 1.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would include the definitions and the known result for powers of 10. Let me check if each assumption applies to one object and one condition.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nAssumption:\n- Each element of D₃ is a natural number containing the digit '3' in its decimal representation.\n- For each integer n ≥ 1, f(n) is defined as the cardinality of the intersection of D₃ with the set {1, 2, ..., n}.\n- For each integer n ≥ 1, the equation f(10ⁿ) = 10ⁿ - 9ⁿ holds.\n- The limit as n approaches infinity of [f(10ⁿ)/10ⁿ] is 1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the limit as n approaches infinity of [f(n)/n] exists and is equal to 1.\n\nI think that's correct. Each assumption is a single condition about a specific object. The problem is to show the limit exists and equals 1.",
