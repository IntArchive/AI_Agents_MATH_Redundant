    "AcceptedAnswer": "We answer the divisibility question, and not the exact form of the quotient, which has already been dealt with.  Let $b$ be fixed , and consider the polynomial $P(x)=x^n-b^n$. Then there is a polynomial $Q(x)$, and a constant $r$, such that\n$$P(x)=(x-b)Q(x)+r.$$\nPut $x=b$. Then since $P(b)=0$, and $(b-b)Q(b)=0$, we conclude  that $r=0$. It follows that $x^n-b^n=(x-b)Q(x)$ for all $x$. Now put $x=a$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object.\n\nLooking at the original problem from the user: the title is about the derivation of the factorization of \\( a^n - b^n \\), and the question is asking for a proof of the identity and why \\( a^n - b^n \\) is divisible by \\( a - b \\).\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions in the problem. The problem statement is general—it doesn't specify any particular constraints on \\( a \\), \\( b \\), or \\( n \\). However, factorization formulas like this one typically hold under certain conditions. For example, the exponent \\( n \\) is usually a positive integer in such factorization problems. Additionally, \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are elements of a ring (like integers, real numbers, etc.) where subtraction and multiplication are defined.\n\nBut the original problem doesn't explicitly state these assumptions. The user might be assuming that \\( n \\) is a positive integer because the factorization \\( a^n - b^n \\) with the sum of terms from \\( a^{n-1} \\) down to \\( b^{n-1} \\) makes sense when \\( n \\) is a positive integer. Also, the divisibility by \\( a - b \\) is a standard result in algebra for such exponents.\n\nSo, the key assumptions here are:\n1. \\( n \\) is a positive integer.\n2. \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are elements of a ring (or more simply, real numbers or integers where the operations are valid).\n\nBut the problem as stated in the question doesn't mention these explicitly. However, to structure it according to the required format, I need to list the implicit assumptions. The example given in the prompt included an assumption that \\( n \\) is divisible by 7, even though the original problem statement just said \"for every integer \\( n \\)\". Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem added an assumption that \\( n \\) is divisible by 7, which might have been part of the original problem but perhaps the user restructured it. Wait, no, the example shows that the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe that example was a mistake? Or perhaps the user intended to modify the problem? Hmm, maybe the example had a different scenario where the original problem had a general n but the formatted problem added an assumption. But in this case, the current problem doesn't have any additional constraints mentioned in the question. The question is about proving the general factorization. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions are minimal here.\n\nWait, the problem is to factor \\( a^n - b^n \\) into \\( (a - b)(a^{n-1} + ... + b^{n-1}) \\). This factorization is valid for any integer \\( n \\geq 1 \\), right? But if \\( n \\) is 0, it's 1 - 1, which is 0, but the factorization would be \\( (a - b)(...) \\), but the sum would have terms with exponents down to -1, which isn't valid. So the assumption is that \\( n \\) is a positive integer. Also, \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are such that the operations make sense, but since the question is general, maybe the only necessary assumption is that \\( n \\) is a positive integer.\n\nSo, in the problem, the key assumption is that \\( n \\) is a positive integer. The original problem didn't specify, but in the factorization formula, \\( n \\) has to be a positive integer for the exponents in the sum to be non-negative. Therefore, the assumption here is that \\( n \\) is a positive integer.\n\nThus, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n- \\( n \\) is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that \\( a^n - b^n = (a - b)(a^{n-1} + a^{n-2}b + \\dots + ab^{n-2} + b^{n-1}) \\) and why \\( a^n - b^n \\) is divisible by \\( a - b \\).\n\nBut wait, the original question is asking two things: to prove the factorization and to explain why it's divisible by \\( a - b \\). The factorization directly shows divisibility, so maybe the problem is just to prove the factorization, which inherently answers the divisibility part. So the problem as structured would list the assumption(s) and then the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n- \\( n \\) is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$a^n - b^n = (a - b)\\left(a^{n-1} + a^{n-2}b + a^{n-3}b^2 + \\dots + a^2b^{n-3} + ab^{n-2} + b^{n-1}\\right)$$ and explain why \\( a^n - b^n \\) is divisible by \\( a - b \\).\n\nBut according to the example, the problem part is concise. In the example, the original problem had \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" and the formatted problem kept that. So maybe in this case, the problem is to prove the factorization, which inherently includes the divisibility. So perhaps the problem statement is as written in the original question: \"Prove that: [formula]\" and \"why is a^n - b^n divisible by a - b\".\n\nBut the user's example included filtering unrelated information. The original question had some redundant parts. The title was \"Derivation of factorization of a^n - b^n\", and the question was \"How does one prove that: [formula]. Better yet, why is a^n - b^n divisible by a -b?\" So the problem is to prove the factorization and explain the divisibility. The assumptions would be n is a positive integer, and maybe a and b are elements of a commutative ring (but probably the user assumes real numbers or integers). But since the problem is general, the key explicit assumption is n is a positive integer.\n\nHence, the formatted problem should have assumption: n is a positive integer, and the problem is to prove the factorization and explain divisibility by a - b.",
