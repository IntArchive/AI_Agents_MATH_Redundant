    "Content": "Suppose we have measure spaces $(X_i, M_i, \\mu_i), i=1, 2,3$, that are complete and $\\sigma$-finite. I learned how to form a product measure from two measure spaces, but I wasn't so sure about product of more than two. So I am learning about it at the moment. I was wondering how does one show that\n$$\n\\mu_1 \\times (\\mu_2 \\times \\mu_3) = (\\mu_1 \\times \\mu_2) \\times \\mu_3.\n$$\nAny hint/solution is appreciated. Thank you!

    "AcceptedAnswer": "In the following I will prove that the product of three measures is associative. This can easily be generalized to a finite number of measures and possibly to countably many measures. As the OP indicates in his/her post scriptum, it all boils down to proving the associativity result for the $\\sigma$ -algebras involved. Let $(X_i,\\Sigma_i, \\mu_i)$ be a measure space, $i = 1,\\ 2,\\ 3$ . In the following I will use the (standard) notations $$\\Sigma_i \\times \\Sigma_j = \\{A \\times B : A \\in \\Sigma_i,\\ B \\in \\Sigma_j\\}$$ $$\\Sigma_i \\otimes \\Sigma_j = \\sigma\\big(\\Sigma_i \\times \\Sigma_j\\big),$$ where $\\sigma(\\cdot)$ indicates the $\\sigma$ -algebra generated by the argument, i.e. the smallest $\\sigma$ -algebra that contains the argument. We can finally state the result we want to prove CLAIM : $\\Sigma_1 \\otimes \\Sigma_2 \\otimes \\Sigma_3 := \\sigma(\\Sigma_1 \\times \\Sigma_2 \\times \\Sigma_3) = \\sigma((\\Sigma_1 \\otimes \\Sigma_2) \\times \\Sigma_3) = \\sigma(\\Sigma_1 \\times (\\Sigma_2 \\otimes \\Sigma_3)).$ Synopsis of the proof: $\\Sigma_i \\times \\Sigma_j \\subset \\Sigma_i \\otimes \\Sigma_j$ is a $\\pi$ -system . Define the \"good set\" and apply the $\\pi-\\Lambda$ -system Theorem . Then use the minimality of $\\sigma(\\cdot)$ several times. PROOF: Notice that $$(\\Sigma_1 \\otimes \\Sigma_2) \\times \\Sigma_3 = \\{A \\times B : A \\in \\Sigma_1\\otimes\\Sigma_2,\\ B \\in \\Sigma_3\\},$$ then fix $B \\in \\Sigma_3$ and let $$\\Lambda = \\{A : A \\in \\Sigma_1 \\otimes \\Sigma_2,\\ A \\times B \\in \\sigma(\\Sigma_1 \\times \\Sigma_2 \\times \\Sigma_3)\\}.$$ Clearly $\\Sigma_1 \\times \\Sigma_2 \\subset \\Lambda$ . Let's prove that $\\Lambda$ is a $\\Lambda$ -system. $X_1 \\times X_2 \\times B \\in \\Sigma_1 \\times \\Sigma_2 \\times \\Sigma_3$ then $X_1 \\times X_2 \\in \\Lambda$ . Let $A_1,A_2 \\in \\Lambda$ , $A_1 \\subset A_2$ . We need to show that $A_2 \\setminus A_1 \\in \\Lambda$ , i.e. we need to show that $(A_2 \\setminus A_1) \\times B \\in \\sigma(\\Sigma_1 \\times \\Sigma_2 \\times \\Sigma_3)$ . This is easy since $\\sigma(\\Sigma_1 \\times \\Sigma_2 \\times \\Sigma_3)$ is a $\\sigma$ -algebra, indeed $$(A_2 \\setminus A_1) \\times B = (A_2 \\times B) \\setminus (A_1 \\times B) = (A_2 \\times B) \\cap (A_1 \\times B)^c \\in \\sigma(\\Sigma_1 \\times \\Sigma_2 \\times \\Sigma_3).$$ Let $\\{A_i\\}$ be an increasing sequence of sets in $\\Lambda$ . We need to show that $\\cup A_i \\in \\Lambda$ . As before, this easily follows from the fact that $\\sigma(\\Sigma_1 \\times \\Sigma_2 \\times \\Sigma_3)$ is a $\\sigma$ -algebra. Let's write out the details! $$\\Big(\\bigcup_{i=1}^{\\infty}A_i\\Big) \\times B = \\bigcup_{i=1}^{\\infty}(A_i \\times B) \\in \\sigma(\\Sigma_1 \\times \\Sigma_2 \\times \\Sigma_3).$$ We can finally apply the $\\pi-\\Lambda$ -system Theorem to conclude that $\\sigma (\\Sigma_1 \\times \\Sigma_2) \\subset \\Lambda$ and hence $\\sigma(\\Sigma_1 \\times \\Sigma_2) \\times B \\subset \\sigma(\\Sigma_1 \\times \\Sigma_2 \\times \\Sigma_3).$ Since this is true for every $B \\in \\Sigma_3$ we obviously get that $$(\\Sigma_1 \\otimes \\Sigma_2) \\times \\Sigma_3 \\subset \\sigma(\\Sigma_1 \\times \\Sigma_2 \\times \\Sigma_3),$$ which in turn yields $$\\sigma((\\Sigma_1 \\otimes \\Sigma_2) \\times \\Sigma_3) \\subset \\sigma(\\Sigma_1 \\times \\Sigma_2 \\times \\Sigma_3).$$ Notice we can apply the same reasoning to show that $$\\sigma(\\Sigma_1 \\times (\\Sigma_2 \\otimes \\Sigma_3)) \\subset \\sigma(\\Sigma_1 \\times \\Sigma_2 \\times \\Sigma_3).$$ The other inclusion is a lot simpler: $\\Sigma_1 \\times \\Sigma_2 \\times \\Sigma_3 \\subset (\\Sigma_1 \\otimes \\Sigma_2) \\times \\Sigma_3$ , so that $$\\sigma(\\Sigma_1 \\times \\Sigma_2 \\times \\Sigma_3) \\subset \\sigma((\\Sigma_1 \\otimes \\Sigma_2) \\times \\Sigma_3),$$ and similarly $$\\sigma(\\Sigma_1 \\times \\Sigma_2 \\times \\Sigma_3) \\subset \\sigma(\\Sigma_1 \\times (\\Sigma_2 \\otimes \\Sigma_3)).$$ This proves the claim. $\\blacksquare$ What happens to the measures was covered by David C. Ullrich in the comments section above.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So the user wants to show that the product measures are associative, specifically that μ₁ × (μ₂ × μ₃) equals (μ₁ × μ₂) × μ₃. Also, they mentioned the same for the sigma-algebras. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what a product measure is. From what I remember, given two measure spaces, the product measure is defined such that the measure of a rectangle set A × B is μ₁(A)μ₂(B). But when dealing with three spaces, there are two ways to associate the product: either group the first two and then with the third, or group the last two first. The question is whether these two approaches give the same result.\n\nThe assumptions given are that each (X_i, M_i, μ_i) is complete and σ-finite. Completeness might be important because sometimes product measures require completion to be well-defined, but here the spaces are already complete. σ-finiteness is crucial because the standard construction of product measures (via Carathéodory's extension theorem) requires the measures to be σ-finite to ensure uniqueness.\n\nNow, for the associativity. Let me think about the sigma-algebras first. The product sigma-algebra M₁ × (M₂ × M₃) is generated by sets of the form A × (B × C) where A ∈ M₁, B ∈ M₂, C ∈ M₃. Similarly, (M₁ × M₂) × M₃ is generated by sets of the form (A × B) × C. But these should be the same because the product sigma-algebra for three spaces is associative. The generated sigma-algebra should not depend on the grouping. So maybe M₁ × (M₂ × M₃) equals (M₁ × M₂) × M₃ in the sense that they both generate the same sigma-algebra on X₁ × X₂ × X₃.\n\nFor the measures, the product measure μ₁ × (μ₂ × μ₃) is defined by first taking μ₂ × μ₃ on X₂ × X₃, then taking the product with μ₁. Similarly, (μ₁ × μ₂) × μ₃ is first taking μ₁ × μ₂ on X₁ × X₂, then product with μ₃. Both should result in the same measure on the product space X₁ × X₂ × X₃. \n\nTo show they are equal, we can use the uniqueness of the product measure. Since all measures are σ-finite, the product measure is unique. So if we can show that both μ₁ × (μ₂ × μ₃) and (μ₁ × μ₂) × μ₃ agree on the generating π-system (the measurable rectangles), then they must be equal. \n\nFor a measurable rectangle A × B × C, where A ∈ M₁, B ∈ M₂, C ∈ M₃, let's compute both measures. \n\nUsing μ₁ × (μ₂ × μ₃), first μ₂ × μ₃ would give μ₂(B)μ₃(C) for B × C, then μ₁ × (μ₂ × μ₃)(A × (B × C)) = μ₁(A) * (μ₂ × μ₃)(B × C) = μ₁(A)μ₂(B)μ₃(C).\n\nSimilarly, for (μ₁ × μ₂) × μ₃, first μ₁ × μ₂(A × B) = μ₁(A)μ₂(B), then multiplied by μ₃(C) gives μ₁(A)μ₂(B)μ₃(C). \n\nSince both measures agree on the rectangles, which form a π-system generating the product sigma-algebra, by the π-λ theorem, the measures must agree on the entire sigma-algebra. Therefore, associativity holds.\n\nBut wait, the problem states the measure spaces are complete. Does completeness affect the product measure associativity? Usually, the product of complete measures isn't necessarily complete, but here the problem states the original spaces are complete. However, the product measures are defined as the completion of the product sigma-algebra with the product measure if the measures are σ-finite. Wait, but the user's original spaces are already complete. Hmm, maybe the product measures here are already complete because the individual measures are complete and σ-finite? Or does the completion step come into play here?\n\nI think when forming the product of two complete σ-finite measures, the product measure is not automatically complete, but in standard constructions, we often take the completion. However, the problem states that the measure spaces are complete, but the product measure might still need completion. However, since the user is forming the product measures in the standard way (as per their learning), maybe the product measures here are already completed. \n\nBut in either case, since both sides (μ₁ × (μ₂ × μ₃) and (μ₁ × μ₂) × μ₃) would be completed product measures, and they agree on the generating sets, their completions would also agree. Therefore, the associativity should hold.\n\nSo the key steps are:\n1. Show that the product sigma-algebras are associative.\n2. Show that both product measures agree on the generating π-system.\n3. Use the uniqueness of the product measure (due to σ-finiteness) to conclude they are equal.\n\nI think that's the approach. Let me check if there's any pitfall here. For example, maybe the product sigma-algebra associativity is not straightforward? But in general, for finite products, the product sigma-algebra is associative because the generating rectangles can be matched. For three spaces, the product sigma-algebra can be generated by all rectangles A × B × C, regardless of grouping. Hence, M₁ × (M₂ × M₃) and (M₁ × M₂) × M₃ are both equal to the three-fold product sigma-algebra M₁ × M₂ × M₃. Therefore, the sigma-algebras are the same.\n\nTherefore, both the measures and the sigma-algebras are associative.",
