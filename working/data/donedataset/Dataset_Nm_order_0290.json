    "AcceptedAnswer": "I used a way to prove this, which I thought may not be the most concise way but it feels very intuitive to me.\nThe matrix $AB$ is actually a matrix that consist the linear combination of $A$ with $B$ the multipliers. So it looks like...\n$$\\boldsymbol{AB}=\\begin{bmatrix}\n &  &  & \\\\ \na_1 & a_2 & ... & a_n\\\\ \n &  &  & \n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n &  &  & \\\\ \nb_1 & b_2 & ... & b_n\\\\ \n &  &  & \n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n &  &  & \\\\ \n\\boldsymbol{A}b_1 & \\boldsymbol{A}b_2 & ... & \\boldsymbol{A}b_n\\\\ \n &  &  & \n\\end{bmatrix}$$\nSuppose if $B$ is singular, then when $B$, being the multipliers of $A$, will naturally obtain another singular matrix of $AB$. Similarly, if $B$ is non-singular, then $AB$ will be non-singular. Therefore, the $rank(AB) \\leq rank(B)$. Then now if $A$ is singular, then clearly, no matter what $B$ is, the $rank(AB)\\leq rank(A)$. The $rank(AB)$ is immediately capped by the rank of $A$ unless the the rank of $B$ is even smaller. Put these two ideas together, the rank of $AB$ must have been capped the rank of $A$ or $B$, which ever is smaller. Therefore, $rank(AB) \\leq min(rank(A), rank(B))$. Hope this helps you!",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. The original question is about proving that the rank of the product of two matrices AB is less than or equal to the minimum of the ranks of A and B. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The example provided included assumptions like \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7.\" Translating that to this problem, the assumptions would relate to the properties of matrices A and B. \n\nSo, for the rank inequality, the key assumptions are that A and B are matrices such that their product AB is defined. That means the number of columns in A must equal the number of rows in B. Additionally, the rank of a matrix is a property related to its dimensions and linear independence of its rows or columns. \n\nI need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property for one object. The matrices A and B must be compatible for multiplication. So, one assumption would be that A is an m×n matrix. Then, B is an n×p matrix. That ensures the product AB is defined (resulting in an m×p matrix). Also, the problem is about rank, which applies to any matrices as long as their product exists. \n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included a condition on n (divisible by 7). Here, maybe there are no additional constraints beyond the matrices being multipliable. So the main assumptions are the dimensions of A and B. Each matrix's dimensions must allow multiplication. So each assumption line would be:\n\n- A is an m×n matrix.\n- B is an n×p matrix.\n\nThese two assumptions ensure that AB is defined. Then the problem is to prove the rank inequality. \n\nI need to check if there are any other implicit assumptions. The problem statement doesn't specify any restrictions on the entries of the matrices (like being over real numbers, etc.), but typically in linear algebra problems like this, the entries are from a field, usually real or complex numbers. However, since the user didn't mention that, maybe it's safe not to include unless required. But the example didn't include field assumptions either. So perhaps the problem is general, and the only assumptions needed are the matrix dimensions. \n\nSo the formatted problem should have assumptions about the dimensions of A and B. Then the problem is to prove the rank inequality. Let me check the example again. In the example, they listed two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Here, the key assumptions are the matrices' dimensions. Each matrix's dimension is a separate line. \n\nYes, so each assumption is one line, one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\nA is an m×n matrix,\nB is an n×p matrix.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $\\text{Rank}(AB)\\leq \\min(\\text{Rank}(A), \\text{Rank}(B))$.\n\nThat seems correct. The original question didn't mention specific dimensions but generally asks for the proof. The key assumptions for the product AB to exist are the dimensions of A and B. So this should be the structured problem.",
