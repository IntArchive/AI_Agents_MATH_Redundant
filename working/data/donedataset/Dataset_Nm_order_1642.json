    "Content": "The following inequality came up while trying to resolve a conjecture about a certain class of partitions (the context is not particularly enlightening):\n$$\nB_n^2 \\leq B_{n-1}B_{n+1}\n$$\nfor $n \\geq 1$, where $B_n$ denotes the $n$th Bell number (i.e. the number of partitions of an $n$-element set). I ran this inequality through Maple for values of $n$ up to 500 or so and did not find a counterexample. There is no nice closed form for $B_n$, so I was hoping to prove this inequality combinatorially rather than analytically (particularly since the given inequality is just the simplest version of a more general inequality I hope to establish). Let $P_n$ be the collection of (not number of) all partitions of an $n$-element set. My approach was to find an injection from $P_n \\times P_n$ into $P_{n-1} \\times P_{n+1}$. Suppose we are to map $(C_1, D_1)$ to $(C_2, D_2)$ and suppose, for convenience, our ground set is the integers from $1$ to $n$. A natural seeming choice was to choose $C_2$ to be the partition $C_1$ with the element $n$ removed. Since removing $n$ will map many partitions in $P_n$ to the same partition in $P_{n-1}$, we would need somehow to choose $D_2$ in such a way as to retain information about where $n$ was in $C_1$. We have the new element $n+1$ to work with, so perhaps it can be used to \"tag\" the partitions in some unique way. I've stressed a combinatorial approach in this post, but I would greatly appreciate any techniques that might be of use in establishing (or refuting) this inequality.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This answer is courtesy of Bouroubi (paraphrased): Theorem . Define $B(x)=e^{-1}\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty k^x k!^{-1}$. Dobinski's formula states $B(n)=B_n$ is the $n$th Bell number.  Now we let $\\frac{1}{p}+\\frac{1}{q}=1$. Then $$B(x+y)\\le B(px)^{1/p}B(qy)^{1/q}.$$ Proof . Let $Z$ be the discrete random variable with density function (under counting measure) $$P(Z=k)=\\frac{1}{e}\\frac{1}{k!}.$$ Observe $\\mathbb{E}(Z^x)=B(x)$. Hölder's inequality gives $\\mathbb{E}(Z^{x+y})\\le\\mathbb{E}(Z^{px})^{1/p}\\mathbb{E}(Z^{qy})^{1/q}$, which proves the theorem. Corollary . The sequence $B_n$ is logarithmically convex, or equivalently $$B_n^2\\le B_{n-1}B_{n+1}.$$ Proof . Set $x=\\frac{n-1}{2}$, $y=\\frac{n+1}{2}$, and $p=q=2$ in the original theorem. Not a combinatorial proof, but straightforward given a couple powerful premises at least. I'm curious, what's the general formula you're trying to establish?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question according to the specified structure. First, I need to understand the original problem and extract the necessary components: Assumptions and the Problem statement.\n\nThe original problem is about proving an inequality involving Bell numbers: B_n² ≤ B_{n-1}B_{n+1} for n ≥ 1. The user mentioned that they checked this up to n=500 and found no counterexamples. They tried a combinatorial approach by attempting to create an injection from P_n × P_n to P_{n-1} × P_{n+1}, where P_n represents the collection of partitions of an n-element set. Their idea involved removing an element from a partition and using the new element to tag information.\n\nNow, applying the required format. The assumptions should list each condition or property applied to one object each. The problem statement should be concise.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. In this case, the inequality applies to n ≥ 1, so the main assumption here is about n being an integer greater than or equal to 1. Also, the problem involves Bell numbers, which are defined as the number of partitions of an n-element set, but since that's part of the definition of Bell numbers, it might not need to be an assumption. The key assumption here is the inequality's domain: n ≥ 1.\n\nSo, the assumption should be \"n is an integer greater than or equal to 1.\" Then, the problem statement is to prove that B_n² ≤ B_{n-1}B_{n+1}.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem just said \"for every integer n\". But in the example, the user might have made a mistake, or maybe the original problem had additional constraints. Wait, looking back at the example given:\n\nOriginal problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem's assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\", which seems incorrect. Wait, that might be an error in the example. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems conflicting. Maybe the example was incorrect, but perhaps the user intended that. So, perhaps in that example, there was an error. However, in our current problem, the user wants us to list the assumptions correctly.\n\nIn the given problem here, the inequality is for n ≥ 1. So the key assumption is that n is an integer ≥1. The Bell numbers are defined for non-negative integers, but the problem specifies n ≥1. So the assumption is n is an integer greater than or equal to 1. The problem is to prove the inequality. Therefore, the formatted problem should have that assumption and the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer greater than or equal to 1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$B_n^2 \\leq B_{n-1}B_{n+1}$$ where $B_n$ denotes the $n$th Bell number.\n\nI need to check if there are any other assumptions. The problem mentions Bell numbers are the number of partitions of an n-element set. That's their definition, so perhaps it's not an assumption but part of the problem statement. So no need to list that as an assumption. The main assumption is the domain of n.\n\nAnother check: The original problem says \"for n ≥ 1\", so that's the key condition. Therefore, the assumption should be as stated. The example given by the user might have added an extra assumption (divisible by 7) which wasn't in the original problem, but perhaps that was a mistake. In our case, we need to adhere to the problem's given conditions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have the assumption on n and the problem statement as the inequality.",
