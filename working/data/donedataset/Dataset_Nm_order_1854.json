The number of tosses is $n+i+1$ if (i) we get exactly $n$ heads in the first $n+i$ tosses, and then a head, or (ii) we get $n$ tails in the first $n+i$ tosses and then a tail.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The problem is to show that the sum from k=0 to n of (2n - k choose n) divided by 2^(2n - k) equals 1. The user mentioned using algebraic or probability methods, so maybe I can explore both approaches.\n\nFirst, let me write out the sum clearly:\n\nS = Σ [C(2n - k, n) / 2^{2n - k}] from k=0 to n.\n\nHmm, combinatorial sums often have interpretations in terms of counting something. Maybe a probability approach would work here. Let me think about probability models that involve binomial coefficients and powers of 1/2, like coin flips.\n\nSuppose we consider a scenario where we're flipping a fair coin. The term C(2n - k, n) / 2^{2n - k} could represent the probability of getting exactly n heads in (2n - k) flips. But why would we sum this over k from 0 to n?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can reindex the sum. Let me try changing variables. Let m = 2n - k. When k=0, m=2n; when k=n, m=2n - n = n. So the sum becomes:\n\nΣ [C(m, n) / 2^m] from m=n to 2n.\n\nBut this is equivalent to summing from m=n to 2n of C(m, n)/2^m. Wait, that's the same as S = Σ_{m=n}^{2n} C(m, n)/2^m.\n\nIs there a known identity for such sums? I recall that the sum from m=n to infinity of C(m, n)/2^m equals 2. Because that's the negative binomial distribution sum: the probability that the nth success occurs on the mth trial, summed over all m ≥ n, with p=1/2. The sum is (p/(1-p))^n / (1-p) ) but wait, for p=1/2, that would be ( (1/2)/(1/2) )^n / (1 - 1/2) ) = 1^n / (1/2) ) = 2. But here we are only summing up to m=2n, not infinity. So S is the sum from m=n to 2n of C(m, n)/2^m = 2 - sum from m=2n+1 to infinity of C(m, n)/2^m. But we need this sum to equal 1. Hmm, maybe not the right direction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a generating function approach. The generating function for C(m, n) is x^n / (1 - x)^{n+1}. So if we set x=1/2, then the generating function becomes (1/2)^n / (1 - 1/2)^{n+1} = (1/2)^n / (1/2)^{n+1} } = 2. But again, that's the sum from m=n to infinity. So the sum up to 2n would be 2 minus the tail, which is sum from m=2n+1 to infinity. But how does that relate to 1?\n\nWait, the problem states that the sum is equal to 1. So perhaps there's a combinatorial identity that truncates the sum at 2n and results in 1. Maybe using recursion or some symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, think of the sum as the probability that in a certain process, you get exactly n successes by time 2n. For example, consider a random walk or a Markov chain.\n\nWait, here's another thought. Suppose we have a sequence of coin flips, and we are waiting for the nth head. The probability that the nth head occurs exactly at flip m is C(m-1, n-1)/2^m. But our term is C(m, n)/2^m. So that's similar but shifted. Alternatively, maybe the number of ways to have n heads in m flips is C(m, n), so the term C(m, n)/2^m is the probability of getting exactly n heads in m flips. So the sum S is summing over m from n to 2n of the probability of getting exactly n heads in m flips. But why would that sum to 1?\n\nWait, but for each m from n to 2n, the events \"getting exactly n heads in m flips\" are mutually exclusive for different m. But the total probability over all m would be sum_{m=n}^\\infty C(m, n)/2^m = 2, as before. But our sum stops at m=2n. So maybe there's a symmetry when m is up to 2n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a combinatorial interpretation where we consider paths or something else.\n\nAlternatively, consider an identity related to Catalan numbers or other combinatorial structures. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, use induction. Let's try mathematical induction on n.\n\nBase case: n=0. Then the sum is k=0 to 0: C(0,0)/2^0 = 1/1 = 1. So holds.\n\nn=1: sum from k=0 to 1. When k=0: C(2,1)/2^2 = 2/4 = 1/2. When k=1: C(1,1)/2^1 = 1/2. Sum is 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. OK.\n\nn=2: sum k=0 to 2. k=0: C(4,2)/2^4 = 6/16 = 3/8. k=1: C(3,2)/2^3 = 3/8. k=2: C(2,2)/2^2 = 1/4. Sum: 3/8 + 3/8 + 1/4 = 6/8 + 2/8 = 8/8 =1. Works.\n\nSo induction might work. Assume it's true for n, prove for n+1.\n\nBut maybe tricky. Let's attempt.\n\nAssume for n, sum_{k=0}^n C(2n -k, n)/2^{2n -k} =1. Need to show sum_{k=0}^{n+1} C(2(n+1) -k, n+1)/2^{2(n+1)-k} =1.\n\nLet me change variable in the new sum: let k' = k. So sum_{k'=0}^{n+1} C(2n + 2 -k', n+1)/2^{2n +2 -k'}.\n\nLet m = k'. Then sum_{m=0}^{n+1} C(2n +2 -m, n+1)/2^{2n +2 -m}.\n\nAlternatively, set l = 2n +2 -m. When m=0, l=2n+2. When m=n+1, l=2n+2 - (n+1)=n+1. So sum from l=n+1 to 2n+2 of C(l, n+1)/2^l. But this is similar to the original sum but with n replaced by n+1 and upper limit 2n+2. Wait, but in the original problem, the upper limit was 2n -k, where k goes to n. So maybe induction is not straightforward here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps generating functions. Let me define G(x) = sum_{k=0}^n C(2n -k, n) x^{2n -k}. Then the sum S is G(1/2). But not sure how to compute that.\n\nAlternatively, recognize that C(2n -k, n) is the same as C(2n -k, (2n -k) -n) = C(2n -k, n -k). Wait, maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, use the identity C(2n -k, n) = C(2n -k, n -k). Because C(a, b) = C(a, a -b). So, 2n -k - (n) = n -k. So C(2n -k, n) = C(2n -k, n -k). But n -k can be negative when k >n, but in our sum k goes up to n, so n -k is ≥0. Hmm, maybe not directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, rewrite the term C(2n -k, n). Let me think of generating functions. Suppose we fix n and consider the sum over k. Let’s let t = 2n -k. Then when k=0, t=2n; when k=n, t=n. So the sum becomes sum_{t=n}^{2n} C(t, n)/2^{t}. Which is the same as sum_{t=n}^{2n} C(t, n)/2^t. This sum is the same as the original expression.\n\nNow, note that sum_{t=n}^\\infty C(t, n)/2^t = 2, as mentioned before. Therefore, sum_{t=n}^{2n} C(t, n)/2^t = 2 - sum_{t=2n+1}^\\infty C(t, n)/2^t. So if we can show that sum_{t=2n+1}^\\infty C(t, n)/2^t =1, then the original sum is 1. But this seems unlikely because for large t, C(t, n) grows polynomially while 2^t grows exponentially, so the tail sum should be very small. For example, when n=1, the tail sum is sum_{t=3}^\\infty C(t,1)/2^t = sum_{t=3}^\\infty t/2^t. Calculate this sum: sum_{t=1}^\\infty t/2^t = 2, so subtracting t=1 and t=2: 2 - 1/2 - 2/4 = 2 - 1/2 - 1/2 = 1. So for n=1, the tail sum is 1, so the original sum is 2 -1=1. Similarly, for n=2, tail sum would be sum_{t=5}^\\infty C(t,2)/2^t. Let's compute that. The total sum from t=2 to infinity is sum_{t=2}^\\infty C(t,2)/2^t. Recall that sum_{t=0}^\\infty C(t,2)x^t = x^2/(1 -x)^3. So for x=1/2, it's (1/4)/(1 -1/2)^3 = (1/4)/(1/8) = 2. Therefore, sum from t=2 to infinity C(t,2)/2^t =2. Subtract t=2,3,4: C(2,2)/4 + C(3,2)/8 + C(4,2)/16 = 1/4 +3/8 +6/16= 1/4 +3/8 +3/8=1/4 +6/8=1/4 +3/4=1. So tail sum from t=5 is 2 -1=1. Then sum up to t=4 (since 2n=4) is sum_{t=2}^4 C(t,2)/2^t =1, which matches the problem's assertion. So in general, sum_{t=2n+1}^\\infty C(t,n)/2^t =1. Therefore, sum_{t=n}^{2n} C(t,n)/2^t=2 -1=1. Wait, but how to show that sum_{t=2n+1}^\\infty C(t,n)/2^t=1 for all n?\n\nThis seems to hold for n=1 and n=2. Maybe it's a general identity. Let's see.\n\nIf we can show that sum_{t=2n+1}^\\infty C(t,n)/2^t =1, then the original sum would be 2 -1=1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a symmetry here. Since the total sum from t=n to infinity is 2, and the sum from t=n to 2n is 1, then the tail sum from t=2n+1 is 1. So this suggests that sum_{t=n}^{2n} C(t,n)/2^t =1 and sum_{t=2n+1}^\\infty C(t,n)/2^t=1 for all n. That's an interesting identity. But how to prove it?\n\nAlternatively, consider that in the infinite sum, we have two equal parts? Maybe not, because for n=1, the split is t=1 to 2 and t=3 onwards, but sum from t=1 to 2 is 1/2 + 2/4=1/2 +1/2=1, and sum from t=3 is 1. So total 2. Similarly for n=2, sum from t=2 to4 is1, and from t=5 is1. So maybe for any n, the sum from t=n to 2n is1 and from t=2n+1 to infinity is1. Hence total 2. This is an interesting observation. If this is a general identity, then the original problem is a direct consequence.\n\nBut how to prove this identity? Let's think combinatorially. The total sum from t=n to infinity of C(t,n)/2^t=2. Then splitting it into two parts: t=n to2n and t=2n+1 to infinity, each summing to1. Why is that?\n\nPerhaps there is a bijection or symmetry. Let me think of the terms C(t,n)/2^t as probabilities. If I can find a bijection between the events counted in t=n to2n and t=2n+1 to infinity that pairs them up, each contributing equally. Alternatively, consider the generating function.\n\nWe know that sum_{t=n}^\\infty C(t,n)x^t =x^n/(1 -x)^{n+1}. Setting x=1/2, gives (1/2)^n/(1 -1/2)^{n+1}= (1/2)^n/(1/2)^{n+1}=2. So that's confirmed. Now, suppose we set x=1/2 in the generating function, but split the sum into two parts: t=n to2n and t=2n+1 to infinity. We need to show that both parts equal1.\n\nAlternatively, consider substituting x=1/2 into the generating function and another substitution. Let’s think of generating functions for each part.\n\nAlternatively, consider that for each t >=n, C(t,n)/2^t is the probability of having n successes in t independent Bernoulli trials with p=1/2. Then sum_{t=n}^\\infty C(t,n)/2^t=2. But why would splitting the sum at t=2n give two equal parts?\n\nWait, maybe due to some symmetry. For example, if we consider the number of trials t needed to get n successes, but also relate it to the number of failures. Since p=1/2, the distribution is symmetric. The number of trials to get n successes is t, which is at least n. But the probability that t >2n would be the same as the probability of having fewer than n successes in 2n trials. Wait, by the reflection principle or something similar.\n\nLet me elaborate. The event that t >2n (i.e., the nth success occurs after 2n trials) is equivalent to the event that in the first 2n trials, there are fewer than n successes. The number of successes in 2n trials is a binomial(2n, 1/2) variable. The probability of having fewer than n successes is sum_{k=0}^{n-1} C(2n, k)/2^{2n}. But due to the symmetry of the binomial distribution with p=1/2, C(2n, k)=C(2n, 2n -k). Therefore, sum_{k=0}^{n-1} C(2n, k)/2^{2n} = sum_{k=n+1}^{2n} C(2n, k)/2^{2n}. Adding these two gives sum_{k=0}^{2n} C(2n,k)/2^{2n} - C(2n,n)/2^{2n}=1 - C(2n,n)/2^{2n}. But since the total sum is1, then sum_{k=0}^{n-1} C(2n,k)/2^{2n} = (1 - C(2n,n)/2^{2n}) /2. Wait, not exactly, because the symmetry is around k=n. So sum_{k=0}^{n-1} C(2n,k) = sum_{k=n+1}^{2n} C(2n,k). But the total sum is 2^{2n}, so sum_{k=0}^{n-1} C(2n,k) = (2^{2n} - C(2n,n))/2. Therefore, the probability of fewer than n successes is (2^{2n} - C(2n,n))/(2*2^{2n}})= (1 - C(2n,n)/2^{2n})/2.\n\nBut this seems different from the tail sum we have. Wait, the tail sum sum_{t=2n+1}^\\infty C(t,n)/2^t is supposed to be1. But according to the above, the probability that t>2n is (1 - C(2n,n)/2^{2n})/2. Which is not necessarily1. Wait, there's a disconnect here. Maybe I made a wrong connection.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the negative binomial distribution, which models the number of trials needed to achieve n successes. The PMF is C(t-1, n-1)/2^t for t >=n. But our term is C(t,n)/2^{t+1} ? Wait, no. In our case, the sum is over C(t,n)/2^t. The negative binomial PMF would be C(t-1, n-1)/2^t. So our sum is different. Let's see: sum_{t=n}^\\infty C(t,n)/2^t = sum_{t=n}^\\infty C(t,n)(1/2)^t. As we've established, this equals2.\n\nBut how does this relate to the negative binomial distribution? The negative binomial with parameters n and p=1/2 has PMF C(t-1, n-1)(1/2)^n (1/2)^{t -n} }= C(t-1, n-1)/2^t for t >=n. So sum_{t=n}^\\infty C(t-1, n-1)/2^t = (1/2)^n / (1 -1/2)^{n} )= (1/2)^n / (1/2)^n )=1, as expected for a PMF. But our sum is sum_{t=n}^\\infty C(t,n)/2^t=2. So there's a factor difference.\n\nWait, but C(t,n) = C(t-1, n) + C(t-1, n-1). Maybe we can relate the two sums. Let's write sum_{t=n}^\\infty C(t,n)/2^t = sum_{t=n}^\\infty [C(t-1, n) + C(t-1, n-1)] /2^t.\n\nSplit into two sums: sum_{t=n}^\\infty C(t-1, n)/2^t + sum_{t=n}^\\infty C(t-1, n-1)/2^t.\n\nFor the first sum, let s = t-1. Then sum_{s=n-1}^\\infty C(s,n)/2^{s+1} }= (1/2) sum_{s=n-1}^\\infty C(s,n)/2^s. Similarly, the second sum: sum_{t=n}^\\infty C(t-1, n-1)/2^t = (1/2) sum_{s=n-1}^\\infty C(s, n-1)/2^s.\n\nNow, the first sum starts at s=n-1, but C(n-1,n)=0, so it's effectively from s=n. Thus:\n\nsum_{s=n}^\\infty C(s,n)/2^{s+1} + sum_{s=n-1}^\\infty C(s,n-1)/2^{s+1}.\n\nThe first term is (1/2) sum_{s=n}^\\infty C(s,n)/2^s = (1/2)*2=1, since we know the total sum from s=n is2. The second term is (1/2) sum_{s=n-1}^\\infty C(s,n-1)/2^s. The sum sum_{s=n-1}^\\infty C(s,n-1)/2^s =2 as well (by replacing n with n-1 in the original identity). Therefore, the second term is (1/2)*2=1. Therefore, the total sum is1 +1=2, which matches. But this is just confirming the original identity through recursion.\n\nBut how does this help us? The key is that we have sum_{t=n}^\\infty C(t,n)/2^t=2, and we need to show that sum_{t=n}^{2n} C(t,n)/2^t=1. If we can show that the tail sum from t=2n+1 to infinity is also1, then we're done.\n\nTo show sum_{t=2n+1}^\\infty C(t,n)/2^t=1.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me consider another approach. Let's interpret the sum as follows: imagine flipping a fair coin until you get n+1 heads. The probability that this takes more than 2n+1 flips is the same as the probability that in the first 2n+1 flips, there are at most n heads. But the probability of at most n heads in 2n+1 flips is sum_{k=0}^n C(2n+1, k)/2^{2n+1}. By symmetry, since p=1/2, sum_{k=0}^n C(2n+1,k) = sum_{k=n+1}^{2n+1} C(2n+1,k) =2^{2n}. Therefore, sum_{k=0}^n C(2n+1,k)/2^{2n+1}=2^{2n}/2^{2n+1}=1/2. So the probability that the (n+1)th head occurs after 2n+1 flips is1/2.\n\nWait, this seems different from what we need. Wait, perhaps if we consider waiting for the nth head instead. The probability that the nth head occurs after 2n flips is equal to the probability that in the first 2n flips, there are fewer than n heads. Which is sum_{k=0}^{n-1} C(2n,k)/2^{2n}. But this sum is equal to (1 - C(2n,n)/2^{2n}) /2 by symmetry. Therefore, the probability that the nth head occurs after 2n flips is (1 - C(2n,n)/2^{2n}) /2. Not sure how this helps.\n\nWait, but we have sum_{t=2n+1}^\\infty C(t,n)/2^t=1. Let's plug in n=1: sum_{t=3}^\\infty C(t,1)/2^t= sum_{t=3}^\\infty t/2^t. As calculated before, this sum equals1. Similarly for n=2, sum_{t=5}^\\infty C(t,2)/2^t=1. So perhaps for general n, sum_{t=2n+1}^\\infty C(t,n)/2^t=1. If we can prove this, then the original identity holds.\n\nAlternatively, consider generating functions. Let’s consider the generating function for the tail sum sum_{t=2n+1}^\\infty C(t,n)/2^t.\n\nWe know the generating function for the entire sum is 2, so the tail sum is2 - sum_{t=n}^{2n} C(t,n)/2^t. If we can show this tail sum equals1, then the original sum must equal1. But this is circular unless we have another way to compute the tail sum.\n\nAlternatively, use induction. Assume that for some n, sum_{t=2n+1}^\\infty C(t,n)/2^t=1. Then for n+1, need to show sum_{t=2(n+1)+1}^\\infty C(t,n+1)/2^t=1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider a combinatorial identity. Notice that C(t,n) = C(t-1,n) + C(t-1,n-1). Maybe apply this recursively.\n\nLet’s attempt to compute the tail sum S = sum_{t=2n+1}^\\infty C(t,n)/2^t.\n\nUsing the identity C(t,n) = C(t-1,n) + C(t-1,n-1), we have:\n\nS = sum_{t=2n+1}^\\infty [C(t-1,n) + C(t-1,n-1)] /2^t\n\n= sum_{t=2n+1}^\\infty C(t-1,n)/2^t + sum_{t=2n+1}^\\infty C(t-1,n-1)/2^t\n\nLet’s change variable in the first sum: let s = t-1. Then t=2n+1 corresponds to s=2n.\n\nFirst sum becomes sum_{s=2n}^\\infty C(s,n)/2^{s+1} = (1/2) sum_{s=2n}^\\infty C(s,n)/2^s.\n\nSimilarly, the second sum: let s = t-1. Then t=2n+1 corresponds to s=2n.\n\nSecond sum becomes sum_{s=2n}^\\infty C(s,n-1)/2^{s+1} = (1/2) sum_{s=2n}^\\infty C(s,n-1)/2^s.\n\nTherefore, S= (1/2)[ sum_{s=2n}^\\infty C(s,n)/2^s + sum_{s=2n}^\\infty C(s,n-1)/2^s ].\n\nBut notice that sum_{s=2n}^\\infty C(s,n)/2^s = sum_{s=2n}^\\infty C(s,n)/2^s. From our earlier knowledge, sum_{s=n}^\\infty C(s,n)/2^s=2. Therefore, sum_{s=2n}^\\infty C(s,n)/2^s=2 - sum_{s=n}^{2n-1} C(s,n)/2^s.\n\nSimilarly, sum_{s=2n}^\\infty C(s,n-1)/2^s= sum_{s=n-1}^\\infty C(s,n-1)/2^s - sum_{s=n-1}^{2n-1} C(s,n-1)/2^s=2 - sum_{s=n-1}^{2n-1} C(s,n-1)/2^s.\n\nBut plugging back into S:\n\nS= (1/2)[ (2 - sum_{s=n}^{2n-1} C(s,n)/2^s ) + (2 - sum_{s=n-1}^{2n-1} C(s,n-1)/2^s ) ]\n\n= (1/2)[4 - sum_{s=n}^{2n-1} C(s,n)/2^s - sum_{s=n-1}^{2n-1} C(s,n-1)/2^s ]\n\nNow, let's combine the sums. The terms in the sums are C(s,n)/2^s and C(s,n-1)/2^s. For s from n to2n-1 in the first sum and s from n-1 to2n-1 in the second. We can split the second sum into s=n-1 and s=n to2n-1.\n\nThus:\n\nS= (1/2)[4 - sum_{s=n}^{2n-1} [C(s,n) + C(s,n-1)] /2^s - C(n-1,n-1)/2^{n-1} ]\n\nBut C(s,n) + C(s,n-1) = C(s+1,n) by the identity C(s,n) = C(s-1,n) + C(s-1,n-1). Wait, no. Let's check:\n\nC(s,n) + C(s,n-1) = C(s+1,n). Wait, actually, C(s,n) + C(s,n-1) = C(s+1,n). For example, C(5,3) + C(5,2)=10+10=20=C(6,3). Yes. So this identity holds.\n\nTherefore, sum_{s=n}^{2n-1} [C(s,n) + C(s,n-1)] /2^s = sum_{s=n}^{2n-1} C(s+1,n)/2^s.\n\nLet’s change variable here: let k=s+1. Then s= n corresponds to k=n+1; s=2n-1 corresponds to k=2n. So the sum becomes sum_{k=n+1}^{2n} C(k,n)/2^{k-1} }= 2 sum_{k=n+1}^{2n} C(k,n)/2^k.\n\nTherefore, S= (1/2)[4 - 2 sum_{k=n+1}^{2n} C(k,n)/2^k - C(n-1,n-1)/2^{n-1} }]\n\nSimplify:\n\nS= (1/2)[4 - 2 sum_{k=n+1}^{2n} C(k,n)/2^k -1/2^{n-1} }]\n\n= 2 - sum_{k=n+1}^{2n} C(k,n)/2^k -1/(2^n).\n\nBut we need to show S=1. Therefore:\n\n2 - sum_{k=n+1}^{2n} C(k,n)/2^k -1/(2^n) =1.\n\nRearranged:\n\nsum_{k=n+1}^{2n} C(k,n)/2^k +1/(2^n) =1.\n\nBut sum_{k=n}^{2n} C(k,n)/2^k=1 (from the original problem's assertion). Therefore, sum_{k=n+1}^{2n} C(k,n)/2^k =1 - C(n,n)/2^n =1 -1/2^n.\n\nThus, substituting back:\n\nsum_{k=n+1}^{2n} C(k,n)/2^k =1 -1/2^n.\n\nTherefore:\n\nS=2 - [1 -1/2^n] -1/2^n =2 -1 +1/2^n -1/2^n=1.\n\nThus, S=1. Therefore, the tail sum from t=2n+1 is1, hence the original sum from t=n to2n is1.\n\nTherefore, the identity holds.",
