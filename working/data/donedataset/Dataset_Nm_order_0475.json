    "Content": "I was wondering why the last digit of $n^5$ is that of $n$? What's the proof and logic behind the statement? I have no idea where to start. Can someone please provide a simple proof or some general ideas about how I can figure out the proof myself? Thanks.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Alternatively, you could prove that $n^5-n$ is divisible by $10$ by induction. If $n=0$, it is obviously true. Assume true for $n$, we need to show that: $$(n+1)^5-(n+1) = n^5 + 5n^4 + 10n^3 + 10n^2 + 5n + 1 - (n+1) \\\\=n^5 - n + 10(n^3+n^2) +5n(n^3+1)$$ is divisible by 10. But $n^5-n$ is divisibly by $10$ by induction, and $10(n^3+n^2)$ is obviously divisible by $10$, so all you need to show is that $5n(n^3+1)$ is divisible by $10$, which is the same as proving that $n(n^3+1)$ is divisible by $2$. The fundamental reason for this, as everybody has noted, is due to rules of modular arithmetic.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem: Why does the last digit of n^5 equal the last digit of n? Hmm, the user is asking for a proof or explanation behind this statement. First, I need to recall some number theory concepts. Maybe modular arithmetic is involved here since we're dealing with last digits, which relate to modulo 10.\n\nSo, if we want the last digit of a number, we can look at the number modulo 10. That is, if n ≡ k mod 10, then n^5 ≡ k^5 mod 10. The claim is that k^5 ≡ k mod 10 for any integer k between 0 and 9. If that's true, then raising n to the 5th power preserves its last digit.\n\nWait, let me check that for each digit from 0 to 9. Let's compute k^5 mod 10 for each k:\n\n0^5 = 0 → 0 mod 10\n1^5 = 1 → 1 mod 10\n2^5 = 32 → 2 mod 10\n3^5 = 243 → 3 mod 10\n4^5 = 1024 → 4 mod 10\n5^5 = 3125 → 5 mod 10\n6^5 = 7776 → 6 mod 10\n7^5 = 16807 → 7 mod 10\n8^5 = 32768 → 8 mod 10\n9^5 = 59049 → 9 mod 10\n\nWow, each of them ends with the same digit as the original. So, indeed, for each digit k from 0 to 9, k^5 ≡ k mod 10. Therefore, since any integer n's last digit is one of these, n^5 will have the same last digit.\n\nBut why does this happen? Maybe Euler's theorem? Euler's theorem states that if k and 10 are coprime, then k^φ(10) ≡ 1 mod 10, where φ(10)=4. So, for coprime k, k^4 ≡1 mod10, which would imply k^5 ≡k mod10. But what about when k is not coprime with 10, like 2, 5, etc.?\n\nWait, for numbers not coprime with 10 (i.e., 2, 4, 5, 6, 8), we need to check individually. For example, 2^5=32≡2 mod10. Similarly, 5^5=3125≡5 mod10. 6^5=7776≡6 mod10. So even for composite numbers, it still holds. So maybe it's a combination of Euler's theorem for coprime cases and direct verification for non-coprime cases.\n\nAlternatively, Fermat's little theorem might not apply here since 10 isn't prime, but Euler's theorem is the generalization. However, since φ(10)=4, so for coprime numbers, k^4 ≡1, so k^5 ≡k. For others, we check directly. Since the non-coprime digits (0,2,4,5,6,8) when raised to the 5th power still give the same last digit. Therefore, overall, n^5 ≡n mod10 for any integer n. Thus, the last digit of n^5 is the same as n.\n\nBut wait, this seems to hold for exponent 5, but does it hold for others? For example, exponent 1 trivially, exponent 5, maybe others? Wait, there's a pattern here. Maybe this is related to a more general theorem, like the one that states that for any integer n, n^k ≡n mod 10, where k ≡1 mod φ(10) or something? But φ(10)=4, so exponents congruent to 1 mod 4. However, 5≡1 mod4 (since 5-1=4), which is 1 mod4. So that could be why. For exponents congruent to 1 mod4, n^k ≡n mod10 for n coprime to 10. But in this case, even numbers not coprime to 10 also satisfy n^5≡n mod10. So perhaps this is a case where the multiplicative order divides 4, and the exponents being 1 mod4 work, but also, the other factors (2 and 5) when raised to higher powers cycle in a way that 5th power brings them back.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fact that 10=2*5, and using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. To show that n^5 ≡n mod2 and mod5. Then, since 2 and5 are coprime, it would hold mod10.\n\nLet's check mod2: For any n, n^5 mod2. If n is even, n≡0 mod2, so 0^5=0≡0. If n is odd, n≡1 mod2, 1^5=1≡1. So n^5≡n mod2.\n\nMod5: By Fermat's little theorem, if n not divisible by5, n^4≡1 mod5, so n^5≡n mod5. If n is divisible by5, then n≡0 mod5, so n^5≡0≡n mod5. Thus, in all cases, n^5≡n mod5.\n\nTherefore, since n^5≡n mod2 and mod5, by Chinese Remainder Theorem, n^5≡n mod10. Hence, the last digit of n^5 is the same as n.\n\nThis seems like a solid proof. So the key ideas are using modulo 2 and 5, applying Fermat's theorem for mod5, checking mod2 directly, then combining via Chinese Remainder Theorem. Therefore, the problem can be approached by splitting into mod2 and mod5 cases, proving each, then combining. The original problem didn't specify any restrictions on n, so the assumptions are just that n is an integer. The problem is to show the last digit of n^5 is the same as n's last digit, which translates to n^5 ≡n mod10.\n\nSo, structuring this into the required format:\n\nAssumptions would be that n is an integer. The problem is to prove that the last digit of n^5 equals the last digit of n. Since the problem doesn't state any additional conditions like n being positive, but typically in these contexts, n is an integer (could be negative, but last digit is the same as its absolute value modulo10). So the assumption is just n is an integer. The problem is to prove the last digit equivalence.",
