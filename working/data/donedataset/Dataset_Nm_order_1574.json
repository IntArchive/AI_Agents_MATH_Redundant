    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example they provided shows how to extract assumptions and restate the problem. The original problem here is about a triangle ABC with an interior point M, and the inequality involving the distances from M to the vertices divided by the lengths of the sides.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. Let's parse the problem:\n\nThe problem states that ABC is a triangle. So that's one assumption. Then, M is an interior point of the triangle. That's another assumption. There might be other implicit assumptions, like the triangle being non-degenerate, but usually in such problems, triangles are assumed to be non-degenerate unless stated otherwise. However, should I include that? The example given didn't mention non-degenerate, but maybe the original problem assumes it. Let me check the original problem again: \"Given a triangle ABC, and M is an interior point.\" So, triangle ABC is given, M is an interior point. The problem is to prove the inequality and find when equality holds.\n\nSo the assumptions should be:\n\n- ABC is a triangle.\n- M is an interior point of triangle ABC.\n\nAre there any other assumptions? The problem mentions the lengths MA, MB, MC, BC, CA, AB. So these are standard Euclidean distances. The sides BC, CA, AB are positive lengths because ABC is a triangle. So maybe the problem assumes that ABC is a triangle with positive side lengths, which is standard. So perhaps the assumptions are as above. The example given in the original question didn't list all the implicit assumptions like sides being positive, just the main ones given in the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, following the example, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nABC is a triangle,\nM is an interior point of triangle ABC.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$\\dfrac{MA}{BC}+\\dfrac{MB}{CA}+\\dfrac{MC}{AB}\\geq \\sqrt{3}$$ and determine when equality holds.\n\nWait, but in the example provided, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, but in the formatted version, they listed n is an integer and then n is divisible by 7. But in the original problem, the question was to prove for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91. However, the formatted problem changed it to an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, no, looking back, the original example in the user's message seems to have a mistake. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists assumptions as n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That seems conflicting. Maybe the example was wrong. But regardless, the user's example shows that the assumptions are to list each condition applied to one object, even if in the original problem it's part of the universal quantifier. But perhaps in that example, the user made a mistake. However, in the current problem, the user wants to list assumptions based on the problem's given conditions.\n\nIn the current problem, the question is given a triangle ABC and M is an interior point. So those are the two main assumptions. There's no mention of the triangle being equilateral or any specific type, so we don't need to add that. The problem is to prove the inequality and find when equality occurs. So I think the assumptions are correctly ABC is a triangle and M is an interior point.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have those two assumptions and then the problem statement as given.",
