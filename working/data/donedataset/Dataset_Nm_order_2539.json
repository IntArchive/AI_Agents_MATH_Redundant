    "Content": "Assume there exist some rationals $a, b$ such that $\\sqrt[3]{a}, \\sqrt[3]{b}$ are irrationals, but: $$\\sqrt[3]{a} + \\sqrt[3]{b} = \\frac{m}{n}$$ for some integers $m, n$ $$\\implies \\left(\\sqrt[3]{a} + \\sqrt[3]{b}\\right)^3 = \\frac{m^3}{n^3}$$ $$\\implies a + b + 3 \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{ab}\\left(\\sqrt[3]{a} + \\sqrt[3]{b}\\right) = \\frac{m^3}{n^3}$$ Since $a +b$, $\\sqrt[3]{a} + \\sqrt[3]{b}$ are rational, $\\sqrt[3]{ab}$ must be rational as well. For convenience let us say $\\sqrt[3]{a} = p, \\sqrt[3]{b} = q \\implies pq$ is rational. This means, for all $i$, $p^iq^i$ is rational. $$\\implies (p + q)^2 = \\frac{m^2}{n^2}$$ $$ = p^2 + q^2 + 2pq = \\frac{m^2}{n^2}$$ Since $pq$ is rational, $2pq$ is rational and so is $p^2 + q^2$. Assume, for some $i$ that $p^i + q^i$ and $p^{i-1} + q^{i-1}$ is rational. $$\\implies (p^i + q^i)(p + q) - pq(p^{i - 1} + q^{i - 1}) = p^{i+1} + q^{i+1}$$ is rational as well. So for all $i$, $$a^{\\frac{i}{3}} + b^{\\frac{i}{3}}$$ and $$a^{\\frac{i}{3}}b^{\\frac{i}{3}}$$ are rational. I know I'm really close to the answer, but it somehow just keeps slipping through my fingers.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "As you have proved, $p^2+q^2\\in\\Bbb Q$ and $pq\\in \\Bbb Q$, so \n$$p-q=\\frac{a-b}{p^2+pq+q^2}\\in \\Bbb Q.$$\nCombining this with $p+q\\in \\Bbb Q$, we are done.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this problem from the Math Stack Exchange question. The title is \"If ∛a + ∛b is rational then prove ∛a and ∛b are rational\". The user is trying to show that if the sum of two cube roots is rational, then each cube root must individually be rational. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The problem states that a and b are rational numbers, and their cube roots are irrational. However, their sum is rational (m/n where m and n are integers). The user then manipulates the equation by cubing both sides, leading to expressions involving a + b and 3∛(ab)(∛a + ∛b). Since a + b and the sum ∛a + ∛b are rational, they conclude that ∛(ab) must also be rational. They let p = ∛a and q = ∛b, so pq is rational. Then they consider powers of p and q, showing that p² + q² is rational, and by induction, all higher powers p^i + q^i are rational. The user feels close but can't see the final step.\n\nThe original problem wants to prove that if ∛a + ∛b is rational, then both ∛a and ∛b are rational. The assumptions given in the question are that a and b are rational numbers, ∛a and ∛b are irrational (but their sum is rational). However, in the problem statement, we need to list all assumptions. The key assumptions here are that a and b are rational, and their cube roots add up to a rational number. The user is trying to show that under these conditions, the cube roots must actually be rational, contradicting the initial assumption that they are irrational.\n\nSo, to structure this properly, the assumptions should be:\n\n1. a is a rational number.\n2. b is a rational number.\n3. The sum ∛a + ∛b is rational.\n\nThe problem then is to prove that under these assumptions, both ∛a and ∛b are rational. \n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user says \"Assume there exist some rationals a, b such that ∛a, ∛b are irrationals, but their sum is rational.\" So the user is assuming a and b are rational, their cube roots are irrational, but their sum is rational, leading to a contradiction. However, the actual problem is to prove that if ∛a + ∛b is rational (with a and b rational), then ∛a and ∛b must be rational. So the problem's actual assumptions are that a and b are rational, and their cube roots sum to a rational. The conclusion is that the cube roots themselves are rational.\n\nSo in the formatted problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- a is a rational number.\n- b is a rational number.\n- √[3]{a} + √[3]{b} is a rational number.\n\nAnd the problem is to prove that √[3]{a} and √[3]{b} are rational.\n\nThe user's own steps involve manipulating the equation to show that if the sum is rational, then various combinations (like ∛(ab)) are rational, and by induction, other powers become rational, leading to the conclusion that p and q (the cube roots) are rational.\n\nBut in the problem statement, we don't need to include the user's steps or their assumptions that the cube roots are irrational (since that's part of their attempted proof leading to a contradiction). The actual problem is to show that given a and b rational and their cube roots summing to a rational, then the cube roots are rational.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list the three assumptions: a and b are rational, the sum of their cube roots is rational, and the problem is to prove the cube roots are rational.",
