    "Content": "I am confused about something in Exercise 4.1 of Chapter 3 of Hartshorne.  It asks us to prove : Let $f : X \\rightarrow Y$ be an affine morphism of Noetherian, separated schemes.  Show that for any quasi-coherent sheaf $\\mathcal{F}$ on $X$, there are natural isomorphisms $$H^i(X, \\mathcal{F}) \\cong H^i(Y, f_* \\mathcal{F}) \\ \\ \\forall i \\geq 0$$ I seem to have a proof without assuming that $f$ is affine or that the schemes are separated (but I need that $X$ is Noetherian).  So I know my proof must be bogus, but I can't figure out why. Proof : Exercise 3.6 of Chapter 3 of Hartshorne says that we can compute cohomology of a quasi-coherent sheaf as the derived functors of $\\Gamma(X, \\cdot)$, considered a a functor from the category of quasi-coherent sheaves to abelian groups.  So let $\\mathcal{F} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{I}^{\\cdot}$ be an injective resolution of $\\mathcal{F}$ in the category of quasi-coherent sheaves.  Then $f_* \\mathcal{F} \\rightarrow f_* \\mathcal{I^{\\cdot}}$ is a flasque resolution of quasi-coherent sheaves of $f_* \\mathcal{F}$  (pushforward of quasi-coherent is quasi-coherent since $X$ is Noetherian).  Moreover, we clearly have $\\Gamma(X, \\mathcal{I}^{\\cdot}) = \\Gamma(Y, f_* \\mathcal{I}^{\\cdot})$.  Therefore, we get the same cohomology groups (this is the same method of proof of Lemma 2.10, Chapter 3, of Hartshorne). What did I do wrong? Sincerely, David",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "When $f$ is affine, then $f_*$ is an exact functor. The reason is that in affine charts this is just some forgetful functor $\\mathrm{Mod}(A) \\to \\mathrm{Mod}(R)$ for some $R$-algebra $A$. Of course, this is needed to get a resolution of $f_* F$ from a resolution of $F$. So the error is: You have forgotten the definition of a resolution.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to break this down. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement from the original question.\n\nThe original problem is about proving a natural isomorphism in cohomology for a quasi-coherent sheaf under certain conditions. The user (David) is confused because his proof didn't use all the given hypotheses, like the morphism being affine or the schemes being separated. He's asking where he went wrong.\n\nNow, looking at the example provided, the assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. So I need to extract all the conditions mentioned in the problem statement.\n\nThe problem states: Let f: X → Y be an affine morphism of Noetherian, separated schemes. Show that for any quasi-coherent sheaf F on X, the cohomology groups H^i(X, F) are naturally isomorphic to H^i(Y, f_* F) for all i ≥ 0.\n\nThe key assumptions here are:\n1. f is an affine morphism.\n2. X and Y are Noetherian schemes.\n3. X and Y are separated schemes.\n4. F is a quasi-coherent sheaf on X.\n\nEach of these is a separate condition. The original problem includes all these assumptions, but the user's attempted proof didn't use the affine morphism or separatedness, so those must be crucial. The task is to structure the problem by listing each assumption individually and then state the problem.\n\nSo, following the example, the assumptions should be listed each on their own line, and the problem restated. I need to ensure that each part of the problem's hypotheses is captured. The user mentions that the schemes are Noetherian and separated, the morphism is affine, and F is quasi-coherent. These all need to be separate assumptions.\n\nI should check if there are any other implicit assumptions. The problem is from Hartshorne's exercise, so maybe Noetherian applies to both X and Y? The original problem says \"Noetherian, separated schemes\", so probably both X and Y are Noetherian and separated. Wait, the problem states \"Let f : X → Y be an affine morphism of Noetherian, separated schemes.\" So X and Y are both Noetherian and separated. But in the example, the assumption was \"n is an integer\", \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- f: X → Y is an affine morphism.\n- X is a Noetherian scheme.\n- Y is a Noetherian scheme.\n- X is a separated scheme.\n- Y is a separated scheme.\n- F is a quasi-coherent sheaf on X.\n\nBut maybe the problem states that both X and Y are Noetherian and separated. So the original problem says \"Noetherian, separated schemes\", which refers to both X and Y. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- X and Y are Noetherian schemes.\n- X and Y are separated schemes.\n- f is an affine morphism.\n- F is a quasi-coherent sheaf on X.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address only one property applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\n- X is a Noetherian scheme.\n- Y is a Noetherian scheme.\n- X is a separated scheme.\n- Y is a separated scheme.\n- f is an affine morphism.\n- F is a quasi-coherent sheaf on X.\n\nThat way, each line is one property for one object.\n\nThe problem then is to show the natural isomorphism between the cohomology groups.\n\nI need to make sure that all these are correctly listed as separate assumptions. The original problem mentions \"Noetherian, separated schemes\" which applies to both X and Y. So splitting into separate lines for each property and each scheme.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have these assumptions and the problem statement.",
