    "Content": "Let $\\Omega\\subset \\mathbb{R}^d $ be a bounded open subset  ( $d\\in \\mathbb{N}$ ) and denote $\\partial\\Omega$ its boundary which we assume to be Lipschitz.  The classical inhomogeneous Neumann problem for Laplace operator  associate to data $f:\\Omega\\to\\mathbb{R}$ and $g: \\partial\\Omega \\to \\mathbb{R}$ (measurable functions) consists on finding a function $u:\\Omega\\to \\mathbb{R}$ satisfying \\begin{equation}\\label{eqlocal-Neumann}\\tag{$N_1$}\n-\\Delta u = f  \\quad\\text{in}~~~ \\Omega \\quad\\quad\\text{ and } \\quad\\quad \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\nu}=  g ~~~ \\text{on}~~~ \\partial \\Omega.\n\\end{equation} In the standard setting one usually choose $ f$ in $L^2(\\Omega)$ or  in the dual space of $H^1(\\Omega)$ and $g$ can be choose in the trace spaces of $H^1(\\Omega)$ denote by $H^{\\frac{1}{2}}(\\partial\\Omega)$ or in its dual $H^{-\\frac{1}{2}}(\\partial\\Omega)$ . Assume $f\\in L^{2}(\\Omega)$ and $g \\in H^{3/2}(\\Omega)$ then we have the following the Green-Gauss formula $$\\label{eqgreen-Gauss}\n\\int_{\\Omega} (-\\Delta) u v \\, \\mathrm{d}x  =  \\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla u \\cdot \\nabla v \\, \\mathrm{d}x- \\int_{\\partial \\Omega} \\gamma_{1} u \\gamma_{0}v \\, \\mathrm{d}\\sigma(x), \\quad u\\in H^{2}(\\Omega) ~\\hbox{and}~v\\in H^{1}(\\Omega).\n$$ Henceforth, on $\\partial \\Omega$ we merely write $\\gamma_0 v= v$ and $ \\displaystyle\\gamma_1 v=\\displaystyle  \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial \\nu} $ . Clearly from this green gauss  formula, if $u\\in H^{2}(\\Omega)$ and solves \\eqref{eqlocal-Neumann}  then $u $ satisfies the variational problem $$\\label{eqlocalvar-Neumann}\\tag{$V_1$}\n   \\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla u \\cdot \\nabla v \\, \\mathrm{d}x=  \\int_{\\partial \\Omega} f v \\, \\mathrm{d}x + \\int_{\\partial \\Omega}gv \\, \\mathrm{d}\\sigma(x), \\qquad \\hbox{for all } ~~v\\in H^{1}(\\Omega).\n$$ In particular if we put $v=1$ the above formulation becomes $$\\label{eqlocalcompatible-Neumann}\\tag{$C_1$}\n \\int_{\\Omega}f\\mathrm{d}x+  \\int_{\\partial \\Omega}g\\mathrm{d}\\sigma(x)=0\n$$ which is the is the compatibility condition. Viceversa we have the following global regularity result . Theorem Assume $\\Omega\\subset \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is bounded open with $C^2$ -boundary. If a  function $ u \\in H^{1}(\\Omega)$ is  solution to \\eqref{eqlocal-Neumann} with $f\\in L^{2}(\\Omega)$ and $g \\in H^{3/2}(\\partial\\Omega)$ then it belongs to $ H^{2}(\\Omega).$ Question: In which book or recommendable reference can I find the proof of the above theorem`?\n   I know that the of this Theorem for the corresponding Dirichlet problem has been done in the book by Brezis or by Evans. Patently, both references avoid the inhomogenous Neumann problem. Remark Moreover, observe that  if $u$ solves  \\eqref{eqlocal-Neumann} or \\eqref{eqlocalvar-Neumann}  so does $\\tilde{u} = u+c$ for every $c\\in\\mathbb{R} $ (that is invariant under additive constant).",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This question has already a bounty winning answer: however, since I found it interesting, upvoted it the very first day it was posted, and found unusual difficulties in finding a nice answer, I nevertheless want to share my own researches and thoughts. The only reference I am aware of which gives a proof of this result, is the textbook by Mikhailov [1]. Precisely, he deals with the regularity problem for the first boundary problem (Dirichlet problem) and the second boundary problem (Neumann problem) for the Poisson equation in §2.3, pp. 216-226. Mikhailov proves the result directly: he first solves the problem in the case of homogeneous boundary conditions , proving the following theorem: Theorem 4 ( [1], p. 217 ). If $f\\in H^k(\\Omega)$ and $\\partial\\Omega\\in C^{k+2}$ for certain $k\\ge 0$ , then the generalized solutions $u(x)$ of the first and second boundary-value problems with homogeneous boundary condition for the Poisson equation belong to $H^{k+2}(\\Omega)$ and satisfy (in the case of the second boundary problem it is assumed that $\\int_\\Omega u \\mathrm{d}x=0$ ) the inequality $$\n\\Vert u\\Vert_{ H^{k+2}(\\Omega)}\\le C\\Vert f\\Vert_{ H^{k}(\\Omega)}\n$$ where the constant $C>0$ does not depend on f. By using this result, he extends the regularity theorem 4 above to the case of non homogeneous boundary conditions ( [2], p. 226 ) by reducing non homogeneous boundary conditions to homogeneous ones. He explicitly does it only for the Dirichlet problem but the same method nevertheless works for the Neumann problem: let's see this. Consider a solution $u(x)$ of the problem \\eqref{eqlocalvar-Neumann} above and a function $\\Phi\\in H^{k+2}(\\Omega)$ whose normal derivative on $\\partial\\Omega$ is $g\\in H^{k+3/2}(\\partial\\Omega)$ , i.e. $$\n\\frac{\\partial\\Phi}{\\partial\\nu}=g\\;\\text{ on }\\;\\partial\\Omega\\label{1}\\tag{1}\n$$ Define $w=u-\\Phi$ : then, for every $v\\in H^{1}(\\Omega)$ , $$\\label{GeneralizedNeumann}\\tag{GN}\n\\begin{split}\n   \\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla w \\cdot \\nabla v \\, \\mathrm{d}x&=\\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla u \\cdot \\nabla v \\, \\mathrm{d}x - \\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla \\Phi \\cdot \\nabla v \\, \\mathrm{d}x \\\\\n  &=  \\int_\\Omega f v \\, \\mathrm{d}x + \\int_{\\partial \\Omega}gv \\, \\mathrm{d}\\sigma(x) - \\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla \\Phi \\cdot \\nabla v \\, \\mathrm{d}x \\\\\n&=\\int_\\Omega f v \\, \\mathrm{d}x + \\int_{\\partial \\Omega}gv \\, \\mathrm{d}\\sigma(x) - \\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla\\cdot(v\\nabla\\Phi) \\, \\mathrm{d}x + \\int_{\\Omega} v\\Delta\\Phi \\, \\mathrm{d}x \\\\\n&=\\int_\\Omega \\big[\\,f + \\Delta\\Phi\\big]v\\, \\mathrm{d}x + \\int_{\\partial \\Omega}gv \\, \\mathrm{d}\\sigma(x) - \\int_{\\partial\\Omega} \\nu \\frac{\\partial\\Phi}{\\partial\\nu} \\, \\mathrm{d}\\sigma(x),\n\\end{split}\\label{2}\\tag{2}\n$$ and substituting \\eqref{1} in \\eqref{2} we get $$\n\\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla w \\cdot \\nabla v \\, \\mathrm{d}x=\\int_\\Omega f_1 v \\, \\mathrm{d}x\n$$ where $f_1=f+\\Delta\\Phi\\in H^k(\\Omega)$ . This means that $w$ solves the Neumann  problem \\eqref{eqlocalvar-Neumann} with homogeneous boundary conditions (i.e. $g\\equiv 0$ ), and by applying theorem 4 we have $$\nw=u-\\Phi\\in H^{k+2}(\\Omega) \\iff u=w+\\Phi\\in H^{k+2}(\\Omega) \n$$ Notes In Mikhailov's notation, $H^0=L^2$ : also he does not use the standard notation for traces, for example expressing that $\\varphi\\in H^{1/2}(\\partial G)$ by saying that $\\varphi$ is a function in $L^2(\\partial G)$ which is the trace of a function $\\Phi\\in H^1(G)$ . Regarding the third boundary problem (the so called Robin problem), Mikhailov  ( [1], footnote *, p. 217 ) remarks that analysis of the regularity of solutions can be dealt as done in theorem 4 above for the solutions to the first and second boundary value problems, provided certain conditions are assumed.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to parse the original question and extract the key assumptions and the main problem.\n\nLooking at the title: \"Need good reference or a proof on regularity of solution to Neumann problem\". The user is asking for a reference or proof regarding the regularity of solutions to the Neumann problem. The main theorem they mention is about a function u in H^1(Ω) solving the Neumann problem with certain conditions on f and g, leading to u being in H^2(Ω).\n\nNow, going through the problem statement. The assumptions listed in the theorem are:\n\n1. Ω is a bounded open subset of ℝ^d with C²-boundary. The original problem mentions \"Assume Ω⊂ℝ^d is bounded open with C²-boundary.\"\n\n2. The function u is in H¹(Ω) and solves the Neumann problem (either (N₁) or (V₁)). The problem states \"If a function u ∈ H¹(Ω) is a solution to (N₁) with f ∈ L²(Ω) and g ∈ H^(3/2)(∂Ω), then it belongs to H²(Ω).\"\n\n3. The data f is in L²(Ω). Specifically, \"f ∈ L²(Ω)\".\n\n4. The Neumann boundary data g is in H^(3/2)(∂Ω). The problem states \"g ∈ H^(3/2)(∂Ω)\".\n\nThe problem is to find a reference or proof for the theorem stating that under these conditions, u is in H²(Ω).\n\nI need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let's check:\n\n- Ω's properties: bounded, open, C² boundary. But the theorem states Ω is bounded open with C²-boundary. So this is one assumption about Ω.\n\n- u is in H¹(Ω) and solves the Neumann problem. Wait, the theorem says \"u ∈ H¹(Ω) is a solution to (N₁)\". So that's two points? Or is \"solves the Neumann problem\" part of the condition? The problem statement says \"if a function u ∈ H¹(Ω) is a solution to (N₁)...\". So the assumptions are:\n\n1. Ω is a bounded open subset of ℝ^d with C²-boundary.\n\n2. u belongs to H¹(Ω).\n\n3. u solves the Neumann problem (N₁): -Δu = f in Ω and ∂u/∂ν = g on ∂Ω.\n\n4. f is in L²(Ω).\n\n5. g is in H^(3/2)(∂Ω).\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption on different objects (Ω, u, f, g). So each should be a separate line in the assumptions.\n\nThe problem is to find a reference or proof for the theorem that under these assumptions, u ∈ H²(Ω).\n\nWait, the user's question is: \"In which book or recommendable reference can I find the proof of the above theorem?\" So the problem is to provide a reference for the proof.\n\nBut according to the example given, the problem part is the actual mathematical statement to be proven or referenced. But in this case, the user is asking for a reference where the theorem is proven. So how to structure that?\n\nLooking at the example, the problem part was the statement to prove. Here, the problem is the request for a reference. But maybe the user wants the theorem itself as the problem, and the assumptions leading to it. But the original user's question is asking for a reference for the theorem's proof. However, the format requires \"Problem: <The problem>\". \n\nIn the example, the problem was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\". So perhaps here, the problem is \"Provide a reference or proof for the theorem that under the given assumptions, u ∈ H²(Ω)\". But maybe the problem should be the theorem statement. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe theorem is: \"Assume Ω⊂ℝ^d is bounded open with C²-boundary. If a function u ∈ H¹(Ω) is a solution to (N₁) with f ∈ L²(Ω) and g ∈ H^(3/2)(∂Ω), then u belongs to H²(Ω).\"\n\nThe problem is to find a reference or proof for this theorem.\n\nBut according to the format, the \"Problem\" part should be the problem statement, which in this case is the theorem's conclusion given the assumptions. So maybe the problem is \"Prove that u belongs to H²(Ω)\" under the listed assumptions. But the user is asking for a reference, not the proof itself. Hmm, this is a bit tricky.\n\nWait, the original example had the problem as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\", which is the mathematical statement. So in this case, the problem should be the theorem statement, which the user wants a reference for. Therefore, the problem part would be the theorem itself, and the assumptions are the conditions of the theorem. Then the user is asking where to find the proof, but according to the format, the problem is the mathematical statement to be proven. So the answer should structure the theorem as the problem, with its assumptions, and the problem is the conclusion.\n\nSo in this case, the problem is to prove that u ∈ H²(Ω) given the assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- Ω is a bounded open subset of ℝ^d with C²-boundary.\n\n- u is a function in H¹(Ω).\n\n- u solves the Neumann problem (N₁): -Δu = f in Ω and ∂u/∂ν = g on ∂Ω.\n\n- f is a function in L²(Ω).\n\n- g is a function in H^(3/2)(∂Ω).\n\nProblem: Prove that u belongs to H²(Ω).\n\nBut the original question is asking for a reference where this proof can be found, not the proof itself. However, the example given by the user shows that the problem is the mathematical statement to be proven, even if the original question was asking for a proof. So perhaps the format requires extracting the mathematical problem, not the request for a reference.\n\nTherefore, following the example, the problem is the theorem statement, structured as the problem to be proven, and the assumptions are the conditions of the theorem. The user's actual request for a reference is part of the original question but isn't part of the formatted problem, which focuses on the mathematical content.\n\nThus, the formatted problem should have the assumptions listed as the conditions of the theorem, and the problem is the conclusion that u ∈ H²(Ω).",
