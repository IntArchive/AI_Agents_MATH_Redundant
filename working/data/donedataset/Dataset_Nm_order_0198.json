    "Content": "The problem So recently in school, we should do a task somewhat like this (roughly translated): Assign a system of linear equations to each drawing Then, there were some systems of three linear equations (SLEs) where each equation was describing a plane in their coordinate form and some sketches of three planes in some relation (e.g. parallel or intersecting at 90°-angles. My question For some reason, I immediately knew that these planes: belonged to this SLE: $$ x_1 -3x_2 +2x_3 = -2 $$ $$ x_1 +3x_2 -2x_3 = 5 $$ $$-6x_2 + 4x_3 = 3$$ And it turned out to be true. In school, we proved this by determining the planes' intersecting lines and showing that they are parallel, but not identical. However, I believe that it must be possible to show the planes are arranged like this without a lot of calculation. Since I immediately saw/\"felt\" that the planes described in the SLE must be arranged in the way they are in the picture (like a triangle). I could also determine the same \"shape\" on a similar question, so I do not believe that it was just coincidence. What needs to be shown? So we must show that the three planes described by the SLE cut each other in a way that I do not really know how to describe. They do not intersect with each other perpendicular (at least they don' have to to be arranged in a triangle), but there is no point in which all three planes intersect. If you were to put a line in the center of the triangle, it would be parallel to all planes. The three planes do not share one intersecting line as it would be in this case: (which was another drawing from the task, but is not relevant to this question except for that it has to be excluded) My thoughts If you were to look at the planes exactly from the direction in which the parallel line from the previous section leads, you would see something like this: The red arrows represent the normal of each plane (they should be perpendicular). You can see that the normals somehow are part of one (new) plane. This is already given by the manner how the planes intersect with each other (as I described before).\nIf you now were to align your coordinate system in such a way that the plane in which the normals lie is the $x_1 x_2$ -plane, each normals would have an $x_3$ value of $0$ . If you were now to further align the coordinate axes so that the $x_1$ -axis is identical to one of the normals (let's just choose the bottom one), the values of the normals would be somehow like this: $n_1=\\begin{pmatrix}\na \\\\\n0 \\\\\n0 \n\\end{pmatrix}$ for the bottom normal $n_2=\\begin{pmatrix}\na \\\\\na \\\\\n0 \n\\end{pmatrix}$ for the upper right normal and $n_3=\\begin{pmatrix}\na \\\\\n-a \\\\\n0 \n\\end{pmatrix}$ for the upper left normal Of course, the planes do not have to be arranged in a way that the vectors line up so nicely that they are in one of the planes of our coordinate system. However, in the SLE, I noticed the following: -The three normals (we can simpla read the coefficients since the equations are in coordinate form) are $n_1=\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 \\\\\n-3 \\\\\n2 \n\\end{pmatrix}$ , $n_2=\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 \\\\\n3 \\\\\n-2 \n\\end{pmatrix}$ and $n_3=\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 \\\\\n-6 \\\\\n4 \n\\end{pmatrix}$ . As we can see, $n_1$ and $n_2$ have the same values for $x_1$ and that $x_2(n_1)=-x_2(n_2)$ ; $x_3(n_1)=-x_3(n_2)$ Also, $n_3$ is somewhat similar in that its $x_2$ and $x_3$ values are the same as the $x_2$ and $x_3$ values of $n_1$ , but multiplied by the factor $2$ . I also noticed that $n_3$ has no $x_1$ value (or, more accurately, the value is $0$ ), while for $n_1$ and $n_2$ , the value for $x_1$ is identical ( $n_1=1$ ). Conclusion I feel like I am very close to a solution, I just don't know what to do with my thoughts/approaches regarding the normals of the planes. Any help would be greatly appreciated. How can I show that the three planes are arranged in this triangular-like shape by using their normals, i.e. without having to calculate the planes' intersection lines? (Probably we will need more than normals, but I believe that they are the starting point). Update: I posted a new question that is related to this problem, but is (at least in my opinion) not the same question.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If you write your systems of equations as a matrix as follows: $$A \\vec{x} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -3 & 2 \\\\ 1 & 3 & -2 \\\\ 0 & -6 & 4 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} -2 \\\\ 5 \\\\ 3\\end{bmatrix} = \\vec{b}$$ then here is a (perhaps) quicker way to determine if the picture looks like the triangle. Note: I don't know how comfortable you are with basic linear algebra concepts, but you only need them to understand the proof of why this is correct. You can apply the method without any understanding of them. $1$ . If all three normal vectors of the planes are multiples of the same vector, then you can immediately conclude you have three parallel\nplanes (and not the triangle). $2$ . If exactly two normal vectors are multiples of the same vector, then you can immediately conclude you don't have the triangle.\nInstead, you have one plane that is cut by two parallel planes. $3$ . If none of the normal vectors are multiples of each other, then it's possible you have the triangle. As you noted, the normal vectors\nmust be in the same plane, i.e. linearly dependent, so it must follow\nthat $\\det(A) = 0$ . If this isn't the case, then you can immediately\nconclude that the planes intersect in one point. $4$ . If there is a solution, then $\\vec{b}$ should be a linear combination of two linearly independent columns of $A$ . (This is because $A \\vec{x}$ is just a linear combination of $A$ 's columns. If there is a\nsolution to $A \\vec{x} = \\vec{b}$ and $A$ has two linearly independent\ncolumns, then $\\vec{b}$ should be able to be written as a linear\ncombination of just those two columns.) Thus, if we replace a linearly\ndependent column (i.e. one that can be expressed as a linear\ncombination of the others) of $A$ with the vector $\\vec{b}$ to create\nthe matrix $A'$ , for there to be no solution (i.e. the \"triangle\"\nconfiguration) it must be the case that $\\det(A') \\neq 0$ . If $\\det(A') = 0$ , then you can conclude you have three planes\nintersecting in one line (the second picture you've posted). Fortunately, choosing a linearly dependent column is easy. You\njust need to make sure to a) replace a zero column with $\\vec{b}$ if $A$ has a zero column or b) if there are two columns that are (nonzero)\nmultiples of each other, then replace one of them with $\\vec{b}$ . And\nif none of a) or b) is the case, then you can choose any column. Example: I'll work thru the steps above with the example you've written. Steps $1$ and $2$ . I can immediately notice that none of normal vectors of the planes are parallel. So we proceed to step $3$ . Step $3$ . We can calculate $$\\det(A) = (1)(12 - 12) - (-3)(4 - 0) + 2(-6 - 0) = 0$$ so we proceed to step $4$ . Note that if you were able to observe that the third row of $A$ was a linear combination of the first and second row (the third row is simply the first row minus the second row) or that the third column was a multiple of the second column, you could immediately skip to step $4$ . Step $4$ . We can notice that none of the columns are zeroes (case a), but in fact the last two columns are multiples of each other. So case b) applies here, and we have to exchange one of the last two columns with $\\vec{b}$ for the process to be correct. Let's replace the last column of $A$ with $\\vec{b}$ to obtain $A'$ : $$A' = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -3 & -2 \\\\ 1 & 3 & 5 \\\\ 0 & -6 & 3 \\end{bmatrix}$$ and we can calculate $$\\det (A') = (1)(9 + 30) - (-3)(3 - 0) + (-2)(-6 - 0) = 29 + 9 + 12 = 60 \\neq 0$$ and hence we can conclude we have the \"triangle\" configuration. Conclusion: I think this method is somewhat easier than calculating the three intersection lines. It requires you to calculate two determinants of $3 \\times 3$ matrices instead.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me start by reading through the original question carefully to extract the necessary information.\n\nThe user is asking how to prove that three planes, given by a specific system of linear equations, are arranged in a \"triangle-like shape\" without calculating their intersection lines. They mentioned that in school, they proved this by finding the intersecting lines and showing they're parallel but not identical. But they want a method that uses the normals of the planes instead.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. Each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. Let's see:\n\n1. The three planes are described by the following system of linear equations:\n   - \\( x_1 - 3x_2 + 2x_3 = -2 \\)\n   - \\( x_1 + 3x_2 - 2x_3 = 5 \\)\n   - \\( -6x_2 + 4x_3 = 3 \\)\n\n2. Each equation in the SLE represents a plane in coordinate form.\n\n3. The goal is to show that these planes intersect in a triangular-like shape, meaning:\n   - No common intersection point for all three planes.\n   - The lines of intersection between each pair of planes are parallel but not coinciding.\n\nThe user also mentions properties of the normals:\n- The normals \\( n_1 = \\begin{pmatrix}1 \\\\ -3 \\\\ 2\\end{pmatrix} \\), \\( n_2 = \\begin{pmatrix}1 \\\\ 3 \\\\ -2\\end{pmatrix} \\), and \\( n_3 = \\begin{pmatrix}0 \\\\ -6 \\\\ 4\\end{pmatrix} \\).\n- Noted relationships between normals: \\( n_1 \\) and \\( n_2 \\) have opposite \\( x_2 \\) and \\( x_3 \\) components, same \\( x_1 \\). \\( n_3 \\) is a multiple of \\( n_1 \\)'s \\( x_2, x_3 \\) components scaled by 2, with \\( x_1 = 0 \\).\n\nBut the problem statement shouldn't include the user's thoughts or observations, only the given conditions and the problem to solve. So the assumptions are the three equations defining the planes. The problem is to show they form this triangular arrangement without calculating intersection lines, probably using normals.\n\nWait, but in the example provided, assumptions include conditions on the variables (like n being integer and divisible by 7). Here, the assumptions are the given planes (equations) and perhaps implicit that they are in 3D space. But the user hasn't stated any additional conditions, just the SLEs. So the main assumptions are the three equations given. But maybe also that each plane is non-parallel? Or do we need to state that each plane is distinct? Hmm.\n\nWait, the problem is to prove the arrangement, so maybe the assumptions are the three equations. The problem is to show that they form this triangular-like shape (no common intersection, pairwise intersections are parallel lines). So the assumptions are just the three equations. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem gives three equations, so the assumption is that these three equations represent three planes. So I need to list each equation as an assumption? But the format says each assumption should be a single property applied to one object. Maybe each plane is defined by its equation. So:\n\nAssumption:\nPlane 1 is defined by the equation \\( x_1 - 3x_2 + 2x_3 = -2 \\).\nPlane 2 is defined by the equation \\( x_1 + 3x_2 - 2x_3 = 5 \\).\nPlane 3 is defined by the equation \\( -6x_2 + 4x_3 = 3 \\).\n\nBut in the example, they didn't list each equation as separate assumptions but rather the conditions on n. However, in this case, the equations are the given conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is already structured with the three equations as given, so the assumptions are just the existence of these three planes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is structured as:\n\nAssumption:\nThe three planes are given by the equations:\n1. \\( x_1 - 3x_2 + 2x_3 = -2 \\)\n2. \\( x_1 + 3x_2 - 2x_3 = 5 \\)\n3. \\( -6x_2 + 4x_3 = 3 \\)\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should be a single line, addressing one property or condition. So each equation is a separate assumption, each defining a plane. However, in the example, the assumptions were two conditions on n. Here, each equation is a separate condition (defining each plane). So:\n\nAssumption:\nPlane 1 is defined by \\( x_1 - 3x_2 + 2x_3 = -2 \\).\nPlane 2 is defined by \\( x_1 + 3x_2 - 2x_3 = 5 \\).\nPlane 3 is defined by \\( -6x_2 + 4x_3 = 3 \\).\n\nBut maybe even more concise, since the equations themselves are the definitions of the planes. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe first plane is \\( x_1 - 3x_2 + 2x_3 = -2 \\).\nThe second plane is \\( x_1 + 3x_2 - 2x_3 = 5 \\).\nThe third plane is \\( -6x_2 + 4x_3 = 3 \\).\n\nBut the example used variables and their properties. Here, since each plane is given by an equation, each equation is an assumption. So each equation is a separate assumption line.\n\nProblem: Show that the three planes are arranged in a triangular-like shape (i.e., their intersection lines are parallel but not coinciding, and there is no common intersection point for all three planes) without calculating the intersection lines, possibly by using properties of their normal vectors.\n\nWait, the user's original problem is to show the triangular arrangement without calculating the intersection lines. So the problem statement should be: \"Prove that the three planes are arranged in a triangle-like shape without calculating their intersection lines.\" But perhaps more precise. The triangular-like shape is defined by the planes intersecting such that each pair intersects in a line, these lines are parallel but not coinciding, and there is no common point where all three planes intersect.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nPlane 1 is defined by \\( x_1 - 3x_2 + 2x_3 = -2 \\).\nPlane 2 is defined by \\( x_1 + 3x_2 - 2x_3 = 5 \\).\nPlane 3 is defined by \\( -6x_2 + 4x_3 = 3 \\).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the three planes are arranged in a triangle-like shape, i.e., each pair of planes intersect in a line, all three lines are parallel but not coinciding, and there is no common intersection point for all three planes, without calculating the intersection lines.\n\nBut in the example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. Here, the problem is to prove the arrangement. However, the user's original question is phrased as \"How can I prove that 3 planes are arranged in a triangle-like shape without calculating their intersection lines?\" So the problem statement is that.\n\nBut to fit into the format, the problem should be concise. So the problem is: \"Prove that the three planes are arranged in a triangle-like shape without calculating their intersection lines.\"\n\nNow, checking if all necessary assumptions are listed. The three equations are the only given information. The assumptions are the three equations. Each equation is a separate assumption. So yes.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption:\nThe first plane is defined by \\( x_1 - 3x_2 + 2x_3 = -2 \\).\nThe second plane is defined by \\( x_1 + 3x_2 - 2x_3 = 5 \\).\nThe third plane is defined by \\( -6x_2 + 4x_3 = 3 \\).\nProblem:\nProve that the three planes are arranged in a triangle-like shape without calculating their intersection lines.\n###\n\nBut wait, the original problem mentions \"triangle-like shape\" which needs to be defined. However, since in the user's explanation, they describe it as having no common intersection, and pairwise intersections are parallel lines. But in the problem statement, perhaps we can use the user's description. However, the example didn't include the definition of divisibility by 91, just stated it. So maybe keep the problem statement as the user's original question, but concise.\n\nThe user's title is: \"How can I prove that 3 planes are arranged in a triangle-like shape without calculating their intersection lines?\"\n\nSo the problem is: \"Prove that the three planes are arranged in a triangle-like shape without calculating their intersection lines.\"\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are the three equations, each on its own line. So the final formatted problem is as above.",
