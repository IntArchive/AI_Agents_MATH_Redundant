    "Content": "Let $l^2$ be the space of square summable sequences with the inner product $\\langle x,y\\rangle=\\sum_\\limits{i=1}^\\infty x_iy_i$. (a) show that $l^2$ is H Hilbert space. To show that it's a Hilbert space I need to show that the space is complete. For that I need to construct a Cauchy sequence and show it converges with respect to the norm. However, I find it confusing to construct a Cauchy sequence of sequences?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "In this answer, I will use $x_n$ as a sequence in $l^2$ and write $x_n(k)$ as the $k$-th member of that sequence. The norm in the Hilbert space is given by $\\|x\\| = \\sqrt{\\langle x, x \\rangle}$. We wish to show that if a sequence $\\{ x_n \\} \\subset l^2$ is Cauchy, then it converges in $l^2$. Suppose that $\\{x_n\\}$ is such a Cauchy sequence. Let $\\{ e_k \\}$ be the collection of sequences for which $e_k(i) = 1$ if $i=k$ and zero if $i\\neq k$. Then $\\langle x_n, e_k \\rangle = x_n(k)$. Notice that $$|x_n(k) - x_m(k)| = |\\langle x_n - x_m, e_k \\rangle| \\le \\|x_n-x_m\\| \\| e_k\\| = \\|x_n-x_m\\|$$ for all $k$ (also note that this convergence is uniform over $k$). Therefore the sequence of real numbers given by $\\{x_n(k)\\}_{n\\in \\mathbb{N}}$ is Cauchy for each $k$, and thus converges. Call the limit of this sequence $\\tilde x(k)$. Let $\\tilde x = (\\tilde x(k))_{k\\in\\mathbb{N}}$. We wish to show that $\\tilde x \\in l^2$. Consider $$\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty |\\tilde x(k)|^2=\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty |\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} x_n(k)|^2=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty |x_n(k)|^2=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\|x_n\\|^2.$$ The exchange of limits is justified, since the convergence of $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} x_n(k)$ is uniform over $k$. Finally, since $\\{ x_n \\}$ is Cauchy, the inequality, $$| \\|x_m\\| - \\|x_n\\| | < \\| x_m - x_n\\|$$ implies that $\\|x_n\\|$ is a Cauchy sequence of real numbers, and so $\\|x_n\\|$ converges. Thus $\\tilde x$ is in $l^2$. Edit: Completing the proof as per the comments. We have thus shown that $\\tilde x$ is in $l^2$. $\\tilde x$ is the most likely candidate for the Cauchy sequence to converge to, and it has been demonstrated to be in our space. What remains is to show that $$\\| x_n - \\tilde x\\| \\to 0$$ as $n \\to \\infty$. We will utilize a generalized form of the dominated convergence theorem for series. This states that if $a_{n,k} \\to b_k$ for all $k$, $a_{n,k} < d_{n,k}$ and $\\sum_{k} d_{n,k} \\to \\sum_{k} D_k < \\infty$, then $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty a_{n,k} = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty b_k$. (here $a_{n,k}, b_k, d_{n,k}, D_{k}$ are all real numbers) Writing $$\\| x_n - \\tilde x\\|^2 = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty |x_n(k) - \\tilde x(k)|^2.$$ We see that in this case $a_{n,k} = |x_{n}(k) - \\tilde x(k)|^2$, $b_k = 0$, and we must find a $d_{n,k}$ that \"dominates\" $a_{n,k}$ to finish the proof. Now note that $|x_n(k) - \\tilde x(k)|^2 \\le 2 |x_n(k)|^2 + 2 |\\tilde x(k)|^2$ and $$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty ( 2 |x_n(k)|^2 + 2 |\\tilde x(k)|^2) = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty  (2 |\\tilde x(k)|^2 + 2 | \\tilde x(k)|^2).$$ Recall that we demonstrated $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty  |x_n(k)|^2 = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty  |\\tilde x(k)|^2$ in the first half. Thus $D_k$ is played by $4|\\tilde x(k)|^2$ in this case. Thus by the dominated convergence theorem we may conclude that $$\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty |x_n(k)-\\tilde x(k)|^2 \\to 0.$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure, separating assumptions and the problem statement. The example provided shows that assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object.\n\nLooking at the original problem: The title is \"Show that $l^2$ is a Hilbert space,\" and the question part explains that they need to show $l^2$ is a Hilbert space by proving it's complete. The user mentions constructing a Cauchy sequence and showing it converges with respect to the norm, but is confused about handling sequences of sequences.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The problem defines $l^2$ as the space of square summable sequences with a specific inner product. So the assumptions would include the definition of $l^2$, the inner product, and what needs to be shown (completeness). However, in the example given, assumptions were properties given in the problem, not what needs to be proven. So the problem part is the actual task.\n\nSo, breaking down the original question:\n\nAssumptions:\n- $l^2$ is the space of square summable sequences.\n- The inner product on $l^2$ is defined as $\\langle x,y\\rangle = \\sum_{i=1}^\\infty x_i y_i$.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $l^2$ is a Hilbert space. Specifically, demonstrate that $l^2$ is complete by constructing a Cauchy sequence in $l^2$ and showing it converges with respect to the norm induced by the inner product.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included specific conditions on the variable (like $n$ being an integer and divisible by 7). Here, the assumptions are more about the definitions provided. Each assumption should be a single property applied to one object.\n\nSo, each line in the assumptions should be a separate condition. The first assumption is about the definition of $l^2$, the second about the inner product. The problem is to show completeness, hence Hilbert space.\n\nBut the original problem part (a) says \"show that $l^2$ is a Hilbert space,\" and the user is focusing on completeness. The example given in the original instruction had the problem part as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91,\" so here, similarly, the problem is to show $l^2$ is a Hilbert space, which requires proving completeness.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list the assumptions as the definitions provided, each on their own line, and the problem as the task to show it's a Hilbert space (i.e., complete).\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is one line, one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\n$l^2$ is the space of square summable sequences,\nThe inner product on $l^2$ is $\\langle x,y\\rangle = \\sum_{i=1}^\\infty x_i y_i$.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $l^2$ is a Hilbert space.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the assumptions included conditions on the variables given in the problem. Here, the problem starts by defining $l^2$ and the inner product. So those are the given conditions. The task is to show completeness, hence Hilbert. So that should be correct.\n\nThe user's example had assumptions as given conditions (n is integer, n divisible by 7) and the problem as proving divisibility. Similarly here, the given conditions are the definitions of $l^2$ and the inner product, and the problem is to show it's Hilbert (i.e., complete).\n\nSo the formatted answer should be:\n\nAssumption:\n$l^2$ is the space of square summable sequences,\nThe inner product on $l^2$ is defined as $\\langle x, y \\rangle = \\sum_{i=1}^\\infty x_i y_i$.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $l^2$ is a Hilbert space.\n\nBut the original problem mentions part (a), but since the user is just extracting the problem, maybe we can ignore the part (a) label. Also, the user's example didn't include the part (a) in the formatted problem.\n\nYes, the example only included the problem statement, not the part labels. So we can omit (a) here.\n\nSo the final formatted problem should have those two assumptions and the problem statement to show $l^2$ is a Hilbert space.",
