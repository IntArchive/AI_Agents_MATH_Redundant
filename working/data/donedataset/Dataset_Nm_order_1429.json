    "Content": "Here's the problem Suppose that\n  $$ a, b \\in \\mathbb {R^+},\\qquad  0 < a + b < 1 $$\n  Prove or disprove that\n  $$ \\exists n \\in \\mathbb{Z^+}: \\left\\{na\\right\\} + \\left\\{nb\\right\\} \\ge 1$$\n  where $\\{x\\} = x - \\lfloor x \\rfloor$ and $\\lfloor x \\rfloor = \\max\\left\\{ n | n \\in \\mathbb{Z}, n \\le x \\right\\}$. Postscripts: The original problem in magazine ( ISSN 1005-6416 ) might be (For a long time, I can't remember clearly): $a, b$ are irrationals, subjects to $\\forall n \\in \\mathbb{Z^+}: \\left\\{ na \\right\\} + \\left\\{ nb \\right\\} \\le 1$, prove that $a + b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Because I've found that $a, b$ needn't have been irrationals, I insist that there be a general proof (I think it's algebrian). I think the steps are like this: Divides $\\left\\{ (x, y) | x, y \\in \\mathbb{R^+}, x + y < 1 \\right\\}$ into many (infinity) pieces. For each piece, we obtain a $n$. It may be easy when $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. Here's the proof: Let $f(n) = \\left\\{na\\right\\} + \\left\\{nb\\right\\}$.\nFor each $x \\not \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, we have\n$\\left\\{x\\right\\} + \\left\\{-x\\right\\} = 1$ So if $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, we have\n$f(1) + f(-1) = 2$ Note that:\n$\\exists T \\in \\mathbb{Z^+}$ subjects to $\\forall n \\in \\mathbb{Z}: f(n + T) = f(n)$ So\n$2 = f(1) + f(-1) = f(1) + f(2T-1) \\le 2 \\max\\left(f(1), f(2T-1)\\right)$ We've done. I'd like a proof with algebraic construction. Thanks",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Look at the following figure of the checkered $(x,y)$-plane with gridlines at integer $x$'s and $y$'s: The points $z_n:=(n\\ a,n\\ b)$ $\\ (n\\in{\\mathbb Z})$ are marked. We will show that at least one $z_n$ with $n>0$ falls in the interior of a grey triangle, which means $\\{n a\\}+\\{n b\\}>1$. We distinguish the following two cases: (i) $b/a$ is rational. $-$ In this case there are $p$, $q\\in{\\rm N}_{\\geq1}$ with ${\\rm gcd}(p,q)=1$ and a $\\lambda>0$ with $a=p\\lambda$, $b=q\\lambda$. All points $z_n$ are lying on the line\n$$\\ell:\\quad t\\mapsto z(t)=(pt, qt)\\qquad(-\\infty<t<\\infty)\\ ;$$ \nin fact $z_n=z(n\\lambda)$. This line passes through the points $(j p, j q)$ $\\ (j\\in{\\mathbb Z})$ and actually is a closed curve $\\gamma$ on the torus $T$ obtained by identifying points $(x,y)$ and $(x',y')$ with $x\\equiv x'$ $\\ ({\\rm mod}\\ p)$  and $y\\equiv y'$ $\\ ({\\rm mod}\\ q)$. Let $\\pi: \\ {\\mathbb R}^2\\to T$ denote the corresponding projection. There is a finite set of segments $\\sigma_k\\subset\\gamma=\\pi(\\ell)$  colored in grey, which makes up for half of the length of $\\gamma$. (i.i) If $\\lambda$ is rational then the $z_n$ project onto only finitely many equally spaced points on $\\gamma$, and some $z_n$ with $n>0$ will project onto the same point as $z_{-1}$ and therefore will lie in the interior of a grey triangle. (This case has already been dealt with by the OP.) (i.ii) If $\\lambda$ is irrational then the  points $\\pi(z_n)$ are dense on $\\gamma$, and some of them will lie in the interior of one of the grey intervals of $\\gamma$. It follows that the corresponding $z_n$ are lying in a grey triangle. (ii)  $b/a=:m$ is irrational. $-$ Put $\\delta:=1-a-b$ and consider again the line\n$$\\ell: \\quad t \\mapsto z(t):=(t, m t)\\qquad(-\\infty<t<\\infty)$$\n(now with a different parametrization). The $z_n$ are equally spaced on $\\ell$ with  distance $d:=\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$. The line $\\ell$ intersects the vertical gridlines $x=k\\in{\\mathbb Z}$ in the points $(k, m k)$ whose ordinates $y_k:=m k$ are irrational for $k\\ne0$. Therefore the $y_k$ are dense ${\\rm mod}\\ 1$. There is a $k_0>0$ such that $1-\\{y_{k_0}\\}<\\delta$. It is easy to see that the segment $\\sigma\\subset\\ell$ with endpoints $(k_0-a, y_{k_0}-b)$ and $(k_0, y_{k_0})$ is lying completely in the grey triangle to the left of  $(k_0, y_{k_0})$. Since $\\sigma$ has length $d$ there is at least one $z_n\\in\\sigma$, and this $z_n$ lies in the interior of  a grey triangle.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants to convert the given Math Stack Exchange question into a structured format with assumptions and the problem statement. First, I need to identify the key elements from the original question.\n\nThe original problem states: For positive real numbers a and b with a + b < 1, prove or disprove that there exists a natural number n such that the fractional parts of na and nb add up to at least 1. The user also mentions that the original problem in a magazine might have involved irrational numbers, but they believe the proof should be more general, not requiring a and b to be irrational.\n\nSo, the main assumptions here are:\n1. a and b are positive real numbers. This is given as a, b ∈ ℝ⁺.\n2. The sum a + b is less than 1. The original condition is 0 < a + b < 1.\n3. The problem is about the existence of a positive integer n such that the sum of the fractional parts {na} + {nb} is at least 1.\n\nWait, the user also mentions something about irrationals in the original magazine problem, but in the current problem, they are not assuming a and b are irrational. So I shouldn't include that in the assumptions here. The key points are a, b positive, a + b < 1, and looking for existence of n where fractional parts sum to ≥1.\n\nSo the assumptions should list each condition on the variables. Each assumption line should address one property applied to one object. Let me check the example given. In the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\" and the formatted assumption listed \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in that example, actually, the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7. Wait, no, looking back, the example was the user's formatted problem where they added an assumption, perhaps mistakenly? Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the example says the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. Then the formatted problem's assumptions are: \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect. Because the original problem didn't require n to be divisible by 7. The user's example might have a mistake. But maybe the example was a different scenario. Wait, perhaps the example is not directly from the same problem. Maybe the user is illustrating how to structure a problem, even if the original problem's assumptions are modified? Hmm, maybe in that example, the user intended to add an assumption that n is divisible by 7, perhaps as a modification. But the key point here is that in the current problem, we need to extract the correct assumptions.\n\nSo back to the current problem. The problem states that a and b are positive real numbers with a + b < 1. Then the problem is to prove or disprove that there exists a natural number n such that {na} + {nb} ≥ 1. So the assumptions are:\n\n1. a is a positive real number.\n2. b is a positive real number.\n3. The sum a + b is less than 1.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption applied to one object (a, b, their sum). Then the problem statement is the rest.\n\nWait, the user's example included a separate assumption for each property. So in their example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". But that seems like a mistake. Maybe the example was wrong, but the instruction is to list the assumptions from the problem, not to add new ones. So perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user wants us to extract the actual assumptions from the given problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the given conditions are a, b positive real numbers with a + b < 1. So three assumptions: a ∈ ℝ⁺, b ∈ ℝ⁺, a + b < 1. The problem is to prove or disprove the existence of a positive integer n such that {na} + {nb} ≥ 1.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have these three assumptions and the problem as stated. The user's additional comments about the original magazine problem involving irrationals are part of the postscripts and don't affect the current problem's assumptions. The current problem doesn't require a and b to be irrational, so we don't include that in the assumptions.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\na is a positive real number,\nb is a positive real number,\na + b is less than 1.\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that there exists a natural number n such that {na} + {nb} ≥ 1.\n\nWait, but the original problem's title was \"For positive real a, b with a + b <1, prove or disprove...\", so that's exactly the assumptions. So each of those three conditions should be separate lines in the assumption list. Each line addresses one property of one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\na is a positive real number,\nb is a positive real number,\n0 < a + b < 1.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"a, b are positive real numbers with a + b <1\". So the user wrote the problem as 0 < a + b <1. But actually, since a and b are positive, their sum is automatically positive, so 0 < a + b <1 is equivalent to a + b <1. However, maybe to be precise, the assumption should be written as \"a + b is less than 1\" but since a and b are positive, the sum is positive. However, the problem statement in the user's original question uses 0 < a + b <1, so perhaps we should include that. Let me check the original problem's statement.\n\nOriginal problem says: \"a, b ∈ ℝ⁺, 0 < a + b <1\". So the user included \"0 < a + b <1\". Therefore, the third assumption is \"0 < a + b <1\". But since a and b are positive, their sum is already positive, so \"a + b <1\" would suffice. However, the problem statement includes \"0 < a + b <1\", so perhaps we should list that as the assumption. But in the problem's context, since a and b are positive, their sum can't be zero, so maybe the \"0 <\" is redundant. But to follow exactly what's given, we can include it.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\na is a positive real number,\nb is a positive real number,\n0 < a + b < 1.\n\nEach on separate lines, each addressing one condition on one object (a, b, their sum). Then the problem is to prove or disprove the existence of a natural n such that {na} + {nb} ≥1.\n\nSo the formatted problem should look like this.",
