    "Content": "I have been chugging through some proofs regarding the dilogarithm, also known as\n[Spencer's function][1]. \\begin{alignat}{2} \n\t\t&  \\operatorname{Li}_2(z) + \\operatorname{Li}_2(-z) = \\frac{1}{2} \\operatorname{Li}_2(z^2)  \n\t\t&& \\text{(Double Identity)} \\tag{1} \\\\\n\t\t&  \\operatorname{Li}_2(z) + \\operatorname{Li}_2(1-z) = \\frac{\\pi^2}{6} - \\log z \\log (1 - z) \\\n\t\t&& \\text{(Eulers reflection formula)} \\tag{2} \\\\\n\t\t&  \\operatorname{Li}_2(-z) + \\operatorname{Li}_2\\left( \\frac{z}{1+z} \\right) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\log^2(z+1)  \n\t\t&& \\text{(Landen's Identity)} \\tag{3} \\\\ \n\t\t&  \\operatorname{Li}_2(z) + \\operatorname{Li}_2\\left( \\frac{1}{z} \\right) = - \\frac{\\pi^2}{6} - \\frac{1}{2}\\log^2(-z) \\ \\ \n\t\t&& \\text{(Inversions formula)} \\tag{4}\n\\end{alignat} With the basis of $\\text{Abel's Identity}$ (see Proving Abel's identity for the Dilogarithm. ). I have been able to prove\nall the the identities except the last. (My proof for $(3)$ , was somewhat convoluted, so hints there would be appreciated..). I have yet to prove $(4)$ , although I have given it two attempts below Attempt 1 In the Abel Identity let $x=y=1-z$ and divide by $2$ to obtain $$\n\\frac{1}{2}\\log(-z)^2 = \\operatorname{Li}_2\\left( -\\frac{1+z}{z}\\right) - \\frac{1}{2} \\operatorname{Li}_2\\left( \\left[ \\frac{1+z}{z} \\right]^2 \\right) -   \\operatorname{Li}_2(1+z)\n$$ By now using $(1)$ with $z = [1+1/z]^2$ and inserting it into the equation above I obtain $$\n\\frac{1}{2}\\log(-z)^2 = - \\left[ \\operatorname{Li}_2\\left( \\frac{1}{z} + 1\\right)- \\operatorname{Li}_2(1 + z)\\right]\n$$ and from here I am stuck. It is close to what I want but I can not find\nany way to transform the right hand side. Attempt 2 From chat the suggestion was to instead look at the integral definition, this gives \\begin{align*}\n\\operatorname{Li}_2(z) + \\operatorname{Li}_2\\left( \\frac{1}{z}\\right) \n   & = - \\int_0^z \\frac{\\log(1-t)}{t}\\,\\mathrm{d}t \n       - \\int_0^{1/z} \\frac{\\log(1-t)}{t}\\,\\mathrm{d}t \\\\\n   &  =  - \\int\\limits_0^1 {\\frac{{\\log \\left( {z - t} \\right) + \\log \\left( {1 - zt} \\right) - \\log z}}{t}dt} \\\\ \n     & = -\\zeta(2) + \\int_0^1 \\frac{\\log z - \\log(1-zt)}{t}\\,\\mathrm{d}t\n\\end{align*} The last step used that $$\n\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\log(1-t)}{t}\\,\\mathrm{d}t \n= \\int_0^1 -\\frac{1}{t} \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{t^n}{n} \\,\\mathrm{d}t\n= \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2} \n= \\zeta(2)\n$$ And this is where I stopped.\nI think this argument can be finished by series expansion, but I got lost in the algebra.\nIf possible I would very much like to prove this identity from Abel's Identity and the three equations stated above. Any hint or solutions is much appreciated as always =)\n[1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spence%27s_function",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original question is about proving the inversion formula for the dilogarithm, specifically that Li₂(z) + Li₂(1/z) equals -π²/6 - (log²(-z))/2. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions from the problem. The question mentions several identities: the double identity, Euler's reflection formula, Landen's identity, and the inversion formula itself. The user has already proven the first three using Abel's Identity but is stuck on the inversion formula. They provided two attempts.\n\nLooking at the problem, the key elements are:\n- The functions involved are dilogarithms, Li₂(z) and Li₂(1/z).\n- The equation to prove is their sum equals -ζ(2) (which is π²/6) minus half the square of the logarithm of -z.\n- The assumptions would include properties or conditions given in the problem. The user mentions using Abel's Identity and the three other proven identities (double identity, Euler's reflection, Landen's). But in the problem statement, are there any specific constraints on z? For example, the inversion formula might require z not to be 0 or 1, and maybe z is a complex number not on the positive real axis? The logarithm of a negative number would require a branch cut, so maybe z is in a domain where -z is in the principal branch. Also, the problem might assume that z ≠ 0 and z ≠ 1 to avoid singularities.\n\nIn the original problem, the user doesn't explicitly state domain restrictions, but since they're working with dilogarithms and logs, those are implicit. So the assumptions should include that z is a complex number not in the region where the functions are undefined. However, in the example given by the user, the assumptions were specific (like n is an integer). Here, maybe the key assumption is about the domain of z. But since the problem is presented as an identity to prove, perhaps the main assumption is about the validity of the inversion formula for certain z, excluding singular points.\n\nLooking at the inversion formula: Li₂(z) + Li₂(1/z) = -π²/6 - (log²(-z))/2. This formula holds when z is not on the positive real axis, I think. So perhaps the assumption is that z is a complex number not in [0, ∞). Also, the problem probably assumes z ≠ 0 because 1/z would be undefined.\n\nSo the assumptions should be:\n\n- z is a complex number,\n- z ≠ 0,\n- z is not a positive real number.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the assumption was split into separate lines for each condition. So each assumption line should address one property. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nz is a complex number,\nz ≠ 0,\nz is not a positive real number.\n\nProblem: Prove that \n$$\n\\text{Li}_2(z) + \\text{Li}_2\\left( \\frac{1}{z} \\right) = - \\frac{\\pi^2}{6} - \\frac{1}{2}\\log^2(-z)\n$$\n\nBut wait, in the example given, the problem had a specific divisibility condition. Here, the problem is to prove the identity. The key is to make sure all necessary assumptions are listed. Alternatively, maybe the problem doesn't have explicit assumptions beyond the definition of the dilogarithm and the properties given. However, the user mentions using Abel's Identity and the three proven equations, so maybe the assumptions are those identities and Abel's Identity? But no, the user wants the assumptions of the problem itself, not the tools used to prove it.\n\nIn the example, the assumption was about the variable n being an integer and divisible by 7, which are conditions of the problem. Here, the inversion formula's validity requires certain conditions on z, which are the assumptions. So I need to list those. Also, note that in the inversion formula, the log(-z) is squared, which suggests that -z must be in the domain where the logarithm is defined (i.e., not a non-positive real number, depending on the branch). So perhaps z is not a non-negative real number. Wait, because log(-z) would require that -z is not a non-positive real number, so z is not a non-negative real number. Wait, if z is a complex number not lying on the non-negative real axis, then -z would not lie on the non-positive real axis, so log(-z) is defined with the principal branch. Therefore, the assumption is that z is a complex number not lying on the non-negative real axis, and z ≠ 0. So splitting that:\n\nAssumption:\nz is a complex number,\nz ≠ 0,\nz is not a non-negative real number.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might just state z is in the domain of the dilogarithm function where the inversion formula holds, but I think specifying the domain explicitly is better.\n\nBut I need to check the standard inversion formula's conditions. According to the dilogarithm inversion formula, it holds for z ∉ [1, ∞), but I need to confirm. Wait, actually, the inversion formula for Li₂(z) + Li₂(1/z) usually holds for z not on the positive real axis. So if z is in the complex plane minus the positive real axis (and z ≠ 0), then the formula holds. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- z is a complex number,\n- z is not a positive real number,\n- z ≠ 0.\n\nTherefore, each of these is a separate assumption.\n\nSo putting it all together, the formatted problem should have these three assumptions and then the problem statement.\n\nChecking the example again, the original problem had a mistake in the formatted version where the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted problem's assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, no: in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem's assumption says \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That's conflicting. Wait, the example might have a mistake. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems like a mistake. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7, which restricts it. That's conflicting. So maybe the example has an error, but the user provided it as their example. Therefore, perhaps in their example, they considered that the original problem might have had a typo, or maybe they filtered out some unrelated info. But given that, perhaps the original problem had more context where n was supposed to be divisible by 7. But regardless, the example shows that assumptions can include conditions both inherent (like n is integer) and additional ones (n divisible by 7).\n\nBut in the current problem, the inversion formula's assumptions are about the domain of z. So following the user's example, even if the original problem didn't state the domain explicitly, we need to infer it from the mathematical context. Therefore, the formatted problem's assumptions would list the conditions on z necessary for the identity to hold, which are that z is a complex number not equal to 0 and not a positive real number. So each of these is an assumption line.",
