    "Content": "I have just read on Wikipedia that in 1799 Gauss proved that $$\\color {blue}{AGM(1,\\sqrt2)=\\frac{\\pi}{\\varpi},}$$ where $AGM$ is the arithmetic–geometric mean (see the previous link) and $\\varpi$ is the lemniscate constant , i. e. the ratio of the perimeter of Bernoulli's lemniscate to its diameter (the analogous of $\\pi$ for Bernoulli's lemniscate; approximately equal to $2.62205755$ ). This fact really blows my mind. I think I have never seen such an astonishing connection between three seemingly unrelated objects: the circle, the lemniscate and the arithmetic-geometric mean of two numbers - other two very special numbers , although I have read that the $AGM$ of two numbers is used to approximate $\\pi$ , so this result might be a bit less surprising. EDIT: In the comments, @SylvainJulien addressed my initial question and suggested an intuitive way to combine these objects: the $AGM$ , by definition, relates sum and products; as for the circle, which is an ellipse, the sum of the distances to the (coinciding) foci is a constant for all points on the curve, while in Bernoulli's lemniscate the product of the distances to the foci is a constant. Moreover, the numbers $1$ and $\\sqrt2$ can be explained because they appear in the definitions of the circle and the lemnniscate respectively. The circle can be described as the locus of points $P$ on the plane such that $\\frac{OP}{r}= \\boldsymbol{\\color{red}{1}}$ (where $O$ is the centre of the circle). On the other hand, the lemniscate of Bernoulli can be defined as the set of points $M$ which satisfy $|MF-MF'|=\\boldsymbol{\\color{red}{\\sqrt2}} \\cdot OM$ , where $F,F'$ are the foci and $O$ is the midpoint of $F, F'$ ; a simple proof of this fact can be found on the French Wikipedia article of Bernoulli's lemniscate (I don't know why it is missing on the English version). I would appreciate some more details and a sketch of a proof. I am not interested in a complete and rigorous one (as I would probably not understand it at my current level), but rather in the idea of a (comprehensible) proof with its key steps. I will be grateful for every insight :)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The question wants (also) more details and arguments on the relation: $$\n\\bbox[lightgreen]{\n\\color {blue}\n{\\qquad\n\\operatorname{AGM}(1,\\sqrt2)=\\frac{\\pi}{\\varpi}\\ ,}\n\\qquad}\n$$ and here are some words on my subjective view. The main connection is done by relating the AGM to an integral, as mentioned on the wiki page: Arithmetic Geometric Mean: Proof of the integral form expression With almost the same notations ( $\\theta$ replaced by $t$ for an easy typing) we introduce: $$\nI(x,y) := \\int_0^{\\pi/2}\\frac {dt}{\\sqrt{x^2\\cos^2t+y^2\\sin^2t}}\n\\ .\n$$ For given $x>y>0$ denote by $x',y'$ their arithmetic, respectively geometric mean. The main property of $I$ is its invariance w.r.t. the one-step AGM-passage from $(x,y)$ to $(x',y')$ . So further steps also invariate $I$ , i.e. $$I(x,y)=I(x',y')=I(x'',y'')=\\dots\\ .$$ The sequence in $\\Bbb R^2$ with terms $(x,y)$ , $(x',y')$ , $(x'',y'')$ , ... is convergent to an element of the shape $(m,m)$ because of the \"sandwich\" chain $y\\le y'\\le y''\\le \\dots\\le x''\\le x'\\le x$ . (The limit must have two equal components, since it is fixed by applying a new AGM-step.)  We denote by $\\operatorname{AGM}(x,y)$ this first or second component $m$ . We have $\\displaystyle I(m,m)=\n\\int_0^{\\pi/2}\\frac {dt}{\\sqrt{m^2\\cos^2t+m^2\\sin^2t}}\n=\\int_0^{\\pi/2}\\frac {dt}m=\\frac\\pi{2m}$ . This gives a formula for $m:=\\operatorname{AGM}(x,y)$ in terms of the integral $I(x,y)$ : $$\n\\bbox[lightgreen]{\\qquad\\color{blue}{\\operatorname{AGM}(x,y)=\\frac\\pi{2I(x,y)}\\ .\\qquad}}$$ Let us now be specific, and start with $x=\\sqrt 2$ , $y=1$ .\nSo we want to show that the denominator in the above\nformula is $2I(\\sqrt2, 1)=\\varpi$ . Let us \"compute\" (or rather reshape) $2I(\\sqrt2, 1)$ . Write below $\\sin^2 t=1-\\cos^2 t$ and substitute $u=\\cos t$ , $t=\\arccos u$ , $dt=-\\frac{du}{\\sqrt{1-u^2}}$ , the minus sign exchanges the corresponding integration extremities: $$\n\\small\n\\begin{aligned}\n2I(\\sqrt 2, 1)&=\n2\\int_0^{\\pi/2}\\frac 1{\\sqrt{2\\cos^2t+\\sin^2t}}\\cdot dt\n=\n2\\int_0^1\n\\frac 1{\\sqrt{1+u^2}}\n\\cdot\n\\frac {du}{\\sqrt{1-u^2}}\n\\\\\n&=\n2\\int_0^1\n\\frac {du}{\\sqrt{(1+u^2)(1-u^2)}}\n=\n2\\int_0^1\n\\frac {du}{\\sqrt{1-u^4}}\\overset?=\\varpi\\ .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$ The $?$ -sign above the equality sign suggests the fact\nthat we have to show the equality: $$\n2\\int_0^1\n\\frac {du}{\\sqrt{1-u^4}}\\overset?=\\varpi\\ .\n$$ We may consider it as \"known\", or as a definition, but in our case, the lemniscate is the foreground object in the question,\nso let us connect the two\nsides of the $\\overset?=$ by an argument. We thus compute the arc length of the \"standard\" lemniscate, and take its perimeter as $2\\varpi$ - as a definition of $\\varpi$ . Note that after a substitution $v=u^4$ , $u=v^{1/4}$ , $du=\\frac 14v^{1/4-1} dv$ the last integral becomes a beta-integral, see also Beta Function on Wolfram mathworld on such integrals: $$\n\\int_0^1\n\\frac {du}{\\sqrt{1-u^4}}\n=\\frac 14\\int_0^1 v^{\\frac 14-1}(1-v)^{\\frac 12-1}\\;dv\n=\\frac 14B\\left(\\frac 14,\\frac 12\\right)\n=\\frac 14\n\\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac 14\\right)\\Gamma\\left(\\frac 12\\right)}\n{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac 34\\right)}\\overset{\\boldsymbol{\\color{green}*}}=\n\\\\\n\\frac 14\n\\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac 14\\right)^2}\n{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\n\\overset{\\boldsymbol{\\color{green}{**}}}=\\frac 1{4\\sqrt2}\n\\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac 14\\right)^2}\n{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac 12\\right)}\n=\\frac 1{4\\sqrt2}\n\\color{blue}{B\\left(\\frac 14,\\frac 14\\right)}\n\\ .\n$$ Here, at $\\boldsymbol{\\color{green}*}$ we have used the \"duplication formula\" for the gamma function, $\\displaystyle \\Gamma\\left(\\frac 14\\right)\\Gamma\\left(\\frac 34\\right)\n=\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\cdot\\Gamma\\left(\\frac 12\\right) \\implies \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac 12\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac 34\\right)}\n=\\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac 14\\right)}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} $ , while at $\\boldsymbol{\\color{green}{**}}$ the relation $\\Gamma\\left(\\frac 12\\right)=\\sqrt \\pi.$ We introduce now $\\varpi$ in the context of the lemniscate of Bernoulli. A half part of the lemniscate (which \"looks like\" $\\infty$ ) is rationally parametrized by: $$t \\to(x(t),y(t))=\\left(\\ \\frac{t+t^3}{1+t^4}\\ ,\\ \\frac{t-t^3}{1+t^4}\\ \\right)\n\\ ,\\qquad t\\in[-1,1]\\ .$$ (It is \"the $\\infty$ without the $\\sim$ \".) Here is a plot of the image of this parametrization: Generated in sage via: var('t'); parametric_plot( ( (t+t^3)/(1+t^4), (t-t^3)/(1+t^4) ), (t, -1, 1) ) The length $\\varpi$ , defined using the lemniscate, is the length of this parametrized curve $t\\to (x(t),y(t))$ : $$\n\\small\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\varpi\n&=\\int_{-1}^1\\|(x'(t),y'(t)\\|\\;dt\n=\n\\int_{-1}^1\\left\\|\n\\ \n\\frac{( 1 - 4t^2 + t^4  )(1 + t^2)}\n{(1+t^4)^2}\n\\ ,\\ \n\\frac{( 1 + 4t^2 + t^4 )(1 - t^2)}\n{(1+t^4)^2}\n\\ \n\\right\\|\n\\; dt\n\\\\\n&=\n\\int_{-1}^1\n\\left(\\ ( 1 + 4t^2 + t^4  )^2(1 - t^2)^2 + ( 1 + 4t^2 + t^4  )^2(1 - t^2)^2\n\\ \\right)^{1/2}\n\\;\\frac{dt}{(1+t^4)^2}\n\\\\\n&=\n\\int_{-1}^1\n\\left(\\ \n\\begin{array}{c}\n(t^{12} + 6t^{10} + 3t^8 - 20t^6 + 3t^4 + 6t^2 + 1)\n\\\\ + \\\\\n(t^{12} - 6t^{10} + 3t^8 + 20t^6 + 3t^4 - 6t^2 + 1) \n\\end{array}\n\\ \\right)^{1/2}\n\\;\\frac{dt}{(1+t^4)^2}\n\\\\\n&=\n\\int_{-1}^1\n\\left(\\ \n2(t^{12}  + 3t^8 + 3t^4 + 1)\n\\ \\right)^{1/2}\n\\;\\frac{dt}{(1+t^4)^2}\n=\n\\int_{-1}^1\n\\left(\\ \n2(t^4 + 1)^3\n\\ \\right)^{1/2}\n\\;\\frac{dt}{(1+t^4)^2}\n=\n\\sqrt 2\\int_{-1}^1\\frac{dt}{\\sqrt{1+t^4}}\n\\\\\n&=\n2\\sqrt 2\\int_0^1\\frac{dt}{\\sqrt{1+t^4}}\n\\\\\n&=\n2\\sqrt 2\\int_1^\\infty\\frac{dt}{\\sqrt{1+t^4}}\\qquad\n\\text{(using the substitution $t\\to \\frac 1t$)}\n\\\\\n&=\n\\sqrt 2\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{dt}{\\sqrt{1+t^4}}\\qquad\n\\text{(and using now $s=t^4$, $t=s^{1/4}$, $dt=\\frac 14s^{3/4}$)}\n\\\\\n&=\n\\frac{\\sqrt 2}4\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{s^{3/4}}{(1+s)^{1/2}}\\;dt\n=\n\\frac{\\sqrt 2}4\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{s^{\\frac14-1}}{(1+s)^{\\frac 14+\\frac 14}}\\;dt\n\\\\\n&\\overset{\\boldsymbol{\\color{red}*}}=\\frac{\\sqrt 2}4  \n\\color{blue}{B\\left(\\frac 14,\\frac 14\\right)}\n=2\\int_0^1\n\\frac {du}{\\sqrt{1-u^4}}\\ .\n\\\\[3mm]\n&\\qquad\\text{ At ${\\boldsymbol{\\color{red}*}}$ we used the integral form for the Beta function $B$ with $m=n=\\frac 14$:}\n\\\\\nB(m,n)&:=\n\\int_0^1\nx^{m-1}x^{n-1}\\; dx\n\\qquad\\text{ (using $x=\\frac s{1+s}=1-\\frac 1{1+s}$, $dx=\\frac {ds}{(1+s)^2}$})\n\\\\\n&=\n\\int_0^\\infty\n\\frac{s^{m-1}}{(1+s)^{m-1}}\n\\cdot\n\\frac 1{(1+s)^{n-1}}\n\\cdot\n\\frac {ds}{(1+s)^2}\n=\n\\int_0^\\infty\n\\frac{s^{m-1}}{(1+s)^{m+n}}\n\\; ds\n\\ .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$ Above we have finally connected $\\varpi$ with the AGM-integral $\\int_0^1\n\\frac {du}{\\sqrt{1-u^4}}$ via $\\color{blue}{B\\left(\\frac 14,\\frac 14\\right)}\n$ . This is one among many relations in the chain of possible\nequivalent forms for $\\varpi$ . We could stop here, because $(*)$ is holding.\nBut there is one more important connection to an elliptic curve, that may be of interest. The related elliptic curve $E$ is (in affine shape) $$E\\ :\\qquad y^2=x^3-x\\ ,$$ and need to join the integral\nof $1/\\sqrt{1-t^4}$ on $[0,1]$ with the integral of the invariant differential $dx/y$ on this elliptic curve between the points with $x=1$ and $x=\\infty$ (which make sense after passing from the affine world to the projective world), this is done by the substitution $x=1/t^2$ , $dx=-2\\cdot\\frac1{t^3}\\; dt$ , $$\n\\small\n\\int_{x=1}^{x=\\infty}\n\\frac{dx}{y}\n=\n\\int_1^\\infty\\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{x^3-x}}\n=\n2\n\\int_0^1\n\\frac{dt}{t^3\\cdot\\sqrt{t^{-6}-t^{-2}}}\n=\n2\n\\int_0^1\n\\frac{dt}{\\sqrt{t^6(t^{-6}-t^{-2})}}\n=\\\\\n2\n\\int_0^1\n\\frac{dt}{\\sqrt{1-t^4}}=\\varpi\n\\ .\n$$ For the elliptic curve $E$ the associated lattice has the periods $2\\varpi$ and $2\\varpi\\cdot i$ . The following sage code gives numeric support for this: sage: E = EllipticCurve(QQ, [-1, 0])\nsage: E\nElliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 - x over Rational Field\nsage: L = E.period_lattice()\nsage: L.0\n2.62205755429212\nsage: L.1\n2.62205755429212*I\nsage: var('t');\nsage: 2*integral( 1/sqrt(1-t^4), t, 0, 1 ).n()\n2.62205755429212 Later EDIT: Above we have an explicit connection between the two integrals $\\int_0^1\\frac{dt}{\\sqrt{1-t^4}}$ and $\\int_1^\\infty\\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{x^3-x}}$ . Both integrals are mentioned in the chain of possible equivalent forms for $\\varpi$ . Both integrals make it possible to see the integral as an integral on an algebraic object, which is an elliptic curve. I will say something more to the last integral involving $dx$ . It is hard here to give in a few words an introduction to the reach structure related to an elliptic curve, but i am trying to mention without proof a web of specific mathematical instances that make this object an interesting object to study. In the last integral we formally write $y$ for the denominator, $y=\\sqrt{x^3-x}$ . Squaring leads to the algebraic equation of an affine curve in Weierstraß form, $$E\\ :\\qquad y^2 =x^3-x\\ .$$ This is the curve sage: E = EllipticCurve(QQ, [-1, 0])\nsage: E.label()\n'32a2' with the human label 32a2 , and we can take a closer look at it on the LMFDB page, after a search of this label. On the subpage LMFDB - elliptic curves we type this label into the corresponding field, and we are linked to www.lmfdb.org/EllipticCurve/Q/32a2 . At one place there is listed the real period, $\\Omega$ , which is $2\\varpi$ on this page, by the used convention . It has two real components, which is the reason for the inserted factor two. In a picture: $y^2=x^3-x$ \" /> Now why is this object interesting (from an arithmetic point of view)? It is so because $E$ , more exactly its projective/homogenized version $Y^2Z=X^3-XZ^2$ which also contains the infinity point $\\infty=O=[X_\\infty:Y_\\infty:Z_\\infty]=[0:1:0]$ , comes with a reach structure, its algebraic (and/or real and/or complex) points can be added, so we have an algebraic group $(E(\\Bbb C),\\oplus)$ with an addition operation $\\oplus$ which is defined algebraically (i.e. using fractions of polynomials in $x,y$ in a generic case). For instance, for each point $T=(x_T,0)$ in the list $(0,0)$ , $(1,0)$ , $(-1,0)$ , we have $T\\oplus T=O$ . (The infinity point $O$ is the neutral element w.r.t. $\\oplus$ , the three $T$ -points are the two-torsion points. Counting also $O$ as torsion point we have in total four torsion points.)\nThere is a lot of information of the elliptic curve regarding its arithmetic, and we are performing the following game. As it comes, the curve $E$ is defined over $\\Bbb Q$ , in fact we have a model of it over the integers, its coefficients in the polynomial equation $y^2-x^3+x=0$ are all integers. We can now \"break\" the $\\Bbb Z$ -information into pieces, we possibly lose something, but we do so.\nLet us consider this equation modulo some prime $p$ and \"count points\" modulo $p$ , i.e. over the field $\\Bbb F_p$ ,  in the projective space, so we count also a point at infinity $O=\\infty$ . For instance, modulo five we have the eight points: $O=\\infty$ , $(0,0)$ , $(\\pm1,0)$ , $(2,\\pm 1)$ , $(3,\\pm 2)$ . We now \"compare\" them with the number of points of the projective space $\\Bbb P^1$ , there are $5+1=6$ points. It turns out (by a theorem of Hasse ) that the difference is \"controlled\". For the prime $5$ it is $a_5=\\#\\Bbb P^1(\\Bbb F_5)-\\#E(\\Bbb F_5)=6-8=-2$ . In a similar manner we compute: $$\n\\small\n\\begin{aligned}\na_3    &= \\#\\Bbb P^1(\\Bbb F_3)   -\\#E(\\Bbb F_3   )=4-4=0\\ ,\\\\\na_5    &= \\#\\Bbb P^1(\\Bbb F_5)   -\\#E(\\Bbb F_5   )=6-8=-2\\ ,\\\\\na_7    &= \\#\\Bbb P^1(\\Bbb F_7)   -\\#E(\\Bbb F_7   )=8-8=0\\ ,\\\\\na_{11} &= \\#\\Bbb P^1(\\Bbb F_{11})-\\#E(\\Bbb F_{11})=12-12=0\\ ,\\\\\na_{13} &= \\#\\Bbb P^1(\\Bbb F_{13})-\\#E(\\Bbb F_{13})=14-8=6\\ ,\\\\\na_{17} &= \\#\\Bbb P^1(\\Bbb F_{17})-\\#E(\\Bbb F_{17})=18-16=2\\ ,\\\\\na_{19} &= \\#\\Bbb P^1(\\Bbb F_{19})-\\#E(\\Bbb F_{19})=20-20=0\\ ,\\\\\na_{23} &= \\#\\Bbb P^1(\\Bbb F_{23})-\\#E(\\Bbb F_{23})=24-24=0\\ ,\\\\\na_{29} &= \\#\\Bbb P^1(\\Bbb F_{29})-\\#E(\\Bbb F_{29})=30-40=-10\\ ,\\\\\na_{31} &= \\#\\Bbb P^1(\\Bbb F_{31})-\\#E(\\Bbb F_{31})=32-32=0\\ ,\\\\\n&\\ \\vdots\n\\end{aligned}\n$$ and so on. (Compare with the\ncoefficients of the form $q^p$ of the associated modular form .) These numbers $(a_p)$ carry the main arithmetic information in the \"broken pieces\" of filtering the integers through a prime numbers sieve, and in a similar manner to the construction of the Euler product for the Riemann zeta function, we can assemble the $(a_p)$ sequence into a similar product, see also the B-SD section on a page: $$  \n\\small\nL(E,s)=\n\\frac 1{1+3^{1-2s}}\\cdot\n\\frac 1{1+2\\cdot 5^{-s}+5^{1-2s}}\\cdot\n\\frac 1{1+7^{1-2s}}\\cdot\n\\frac 1{1+11^{1-2s}}\\cdot\n\\frac 1{1-6\\cdot 13^{-s}+13^{1-2s}}\\cdot\n\\dots\n$$ We formally compute this $L$ -series in $s=1$ , and put together in a product the information from the prime places, $$  \n\\small\n\\begin{aligned}\nL(E,1)&=\n\\frac 3{\\#E(\\Bbb F_{3})}\\cdot\n\\frac 5{\\#E(\\Bbb F_{5})}\\cdot\n\\frac 7{\\#E(\\Bbb F_{7})}\\cdot\n\\frac {11}{\\#E(\\Bbb F_{11})}\\cdot\n\\frac {13}{\\#E(\\Bbb F_{13})}\\cdot\n\\frac {17}{\\#E(\\Bbb F_{17})}\\cdot\n\\frac {19}{\\#E(\\Bbb F_{19})}\\cdot\n%\\frac {23}{\\#E(\\Bbb F_{23})}\\cdot\n%\\frac {29}{\\#E(\\Bbb F_{29})}\\cdot\n%\\frac {31}{\\#E(\\Bbb F_{31})}\\cdot\n\\;\\dots\n\\\\\n&=\n\\frac{3}{4}\\cdot\n\\frac{5}{8}\\cdot\n\\frac{7}{8}\\cdot\n\\frac{11}{12}\\cdot\n\\frac{13}{8}\\cdot\n\\frac{17}{16}\\cdot\n\\frac{19}{20}\\cdot\n\\frac{23}{24}\\cdot\n\\frac{29}{40}\\cdot\n\\frac{31}{32}\\cdot\n\\frac{37}{40}\\cdot\n\\frac{41}{32}\\cdot\n\\frac{43}{44}\\cdot\n\\frac{47}{48}\\cdot\n\\frac{53}{40}\\cdot\n\\frac{59}{60}\\cdot\n\\frac{61}{72}\\cdot\n%\\frac{67}{68}\\cdot\n%\\frac{71}{72}\\cdot\n%\\frac{73}{80}\\cdot\n%\\frac{79}{80}\\cdot\n\\;\\dots\n\\\\\n&\\overset !=\\frac{1\\cdot2\\varpi\\cdot 1\\cdot 2}{4^2}\n=\n\\bbox[lightyellow]{\\frac{\\varpi}4}\n\\approx0.65551438857302995261620989747277985342068\\dots\\ .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$ (The prime number two is \"somehow different\" in the context, the curve $E$ \"degenerates\" modulo two, and it turns out that there is \"no\" $2$ - $L$ -series factor.) For short, the broken arithmetic information is recollected in an expression featuring two \"analytic pieces\", the period $\\Omega=2\\varpi$ , and the regulator $\\operatorname{Reg}(E)=1$ , together with some \"global arithmetic information\", which finally produces the factor $\\frac 2{4^2}$ . (The $4$ is the number of torsion points.) In my eyes, this connection of an elliptic integral with the (real) period of an elliptic curve, is the most intricate and intriguing instance of a transcendent number in a situation governed by an algebraic situation. The above $\\overset!=$ is an equality, it is a theorem. But we have no similar information for the \"cousin\" elliptic curve $y^2=x^3-226x$ with real period $\\int_{\\sqrt{226}}^\\infty\\frac{dx}{x^3-226x}=\\bbox[lightyellow]{\\frac{\\varpi}{\\sqrt[4]{226}}}$ . Of course, the complication is on the arithmetic side, this is an elliptic curve over $\\Bbb Q$ with two torsion points, $O=\\infty$ and $(0,0)$ , rank three , generators of the free part of $E(\\Bbb Q)$ being $(-1,15)$ , $(-8,36)$ , $(121/4, 1155/8)$ , and regulator $\\operatorname{Reg}(E)\\approx 23.6131617974\\dots$ computed from them. Then any progress in showing the B-SD relation: $$\n\\small\n\\frac{L'''(E,1)}{3!}\n\\overset?\n=\n\\frac 1{2^2}\\cdot1\\cdot\\frac{2\\varpi}{\\sqrt[4]{226}}\\cdot \\operatorname{Reg}(E)\\cdot(226^2)\n$$ would be a true breakthrough. I have to stop here.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me first read through the original question carefully.\n\nThe user is talking about Gauss proving that the arithmetic-geometric mean (AGM) of 1 and sqrt(2) equals pi divided by the lemniscate constant varpi. They mention that AGM is related to the circle and the lemniscate, and they want a sketch of the proof or key steps explaining this connection.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that AGM(1, sqrt(2)) = pi/varpi. The assumptions here would be the definitions or conditions given in the problem. Let's break it down:\n\n1. AGM is the arithmetic-geometric mean of two numbers. In this case, the two numbers are 1 and sqrt(2). So the first assumption is that AGM is applied to 1 and sqrt(2).\n\n2. The lemniscate constant varpi is defined as the ratio of the perimeter of Bernoulli's lemniscate to its diameter. That's another assumption about the definition of varpi.\n\n3. The problem is to prove the equality between AGM(1, sqrt(2)) and pi/varpi. The original question also mentions that Gauss proved this, but the actual problem for the user is to understand the connection and the proof steps.\n\nWait, but in the example given by the user, they filtered out the assumptions about the problem's conditions. For instance, in the example, they listed that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7 as assumptions, even though the original problem only stated \"for every integer n\". The user's example seems to have made a mistake there because the original problem didn't specify that n is divisible by 7. Wait, actually, looking back, the example might have a typo. Let me check.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions are \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, that seems incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which includes all integers, not just those divisible by 7. Maybe the example is wrong, but the user wants me to follow their format. However, in their example, they added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. Hmm, perhaps the example is incorrect, but I should follow the instructions regardless.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user is asking to structure the problem into assumptions and the problem statement. The original question is about proving AGM(1, sqrt(2)) = pi/varpi. The assumptions here would be the definitions involved. Let's list them:\n\n- AGM is the arithmetic-geometric mean of 1 and sqrt(2).\n\n- The lemniscate constant varpi is defined as the ratio of the perimeter of Bernoulli's lemniscate to its diameter.\n\n- The problem is to prove the equality AGM(1, sqrt(2)) = pi/varpi.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption 1: AGM is the arithmetic-geometric mean of 1 and √2.\n\nAssumption 2: ϖ (lemniscate constant) is the ratio of the perimeter of Bernoulli's lemniscate to its diameter.\n\nProblem: Prove that AGM(1, √2) = π/ϖ.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included \"n is an integer\", which was part of the original problem's statement, even though it was \"for every integer n\". So perhaps the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem, not the definitions. But the user's example seems to have an error where they added an assumption not present. Let me think again.\n\nIn the original example, the problem was to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions were \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" But that's incorrect because the original problem didn't require n to be divisible by 7. So maybe the example is incorrect, but the user still wants me to follow their structure. However, in the current problem, the user is asking to structure the problem as per their example.\n\nWait, perhaps the example is a mistake, but the key idea is to list all the given assumptions. So in the current problem, the key assumptions are:\n\n1. The arithmetic-geometric mean (AGM) is taken of 1 and √2.\n\n2. The lemniscate constant ϖ is defined as the ratio of the perimeter of Bernoulli's lemniscate to its diameter.\n\n3. The relationship to be proven is AGM(1, √2) = π/ϖ.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address only one property applied to one object. So each assumption is a single fact about a single object. So:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- AGM(1, √2) is the arithmetic-geometric mean of 1 and √2.\n\n- ϖ is the lemniscate constant defined as the ratio of the perimeter of Bernoulli's lemniscate to its diameter.\n\nProblem: Prove that AGM(1, √2) equals π/ϖ.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to show the equality given that AGM is defined as the arithmetic-geometric mean, and ϖ is defined as that ratio. So the assumptions are the definitions of AGM and ϖ.\n\nThus, the formatted problem should have assumptions as the definitions of the terms involved, and the problem is to establish the relation between them.",
