    "Content": "This is Exercise 2.6.5 of F. M. Goodman's \"Algebra: Abstract and Concrete\" . I want to check my proof. Exercise 2.6.5: Show that a subgroup (of a group) is normal if and only if it is the union of conjugacy classes. My Attempt: Let $N$ be a subgroup of a group $G$ . Then $$\\begin{align}\nN\\text{ is normal }&\\Leftrightarrow \\forall g\\in G, N=gNg^{-1} \\\\\n&\\Leftrightarrow \\forall n\\in N \\forall g\\in G\\exists m_{n, g}\\in N, n=gm_{n, g}g^{-1} \\tag{1}\\\\\n&\\Leftrightarrow N=\\bigcup_{n\\in N}\\underbrace{\\bigcup_{g\\in G}\\left\\{gm_{n, g}g^{-1}\\right\\}}_{\\text{conjugacy class of }n}\\tag{2} \\\\\n&\\Leftrightarrow N=\\bigcup_{n\\in N}[n],\n\\end{align}$$ where $[n]$ is the conjugacy class of $n$ . $\\square$ Is this proof valid? Thoughts: I hope to make $(1)$ to $(2)$ (and back) more explicit. Please help :)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If $N$ is a normal subgroup of group $G$ and $n\\in N$ then $gng^{-1}\\in N$ for every $g\\in G$ or equivalently $[n]\\subseteq N$ where $[n]:=\\{gng^{-1}\\mid g\\in G\\}$ is the conjugacy class of $n$. This tells us that: $$N=\\bigcup_{n\\in N}[n]$$\nIf conversely $N$ is a subgroup of group $G$ that satisfies $N=\\bigcup_{n\\in N}[n]$ then it is immediate that $gng^{-1}\\in N$ for every $n\\in N$ and $g\\in G$, so the conclusion that $N$ is a normal subgroup is justified.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me tackle this problem. The user wants to know if their proof is valid for showing that a subgroup is normal if and only if it's the union of conjugacy classes. The original question is from a textbook, so the problem itself is likely correctly stated. The user provided their attempt, and they're questioning the validity, especially the steps from (1) to (2) and back. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what a normal subgroup is. A subgroup N of G is normal if for every g in G, gNg^{-1} = N. That means conjugation by any element g leaves N invariant. \n\nThe user's proof starts with the definition of normality, then translates it into an element-wise condition: for every n in N and every g in G, there exists an m_{n,g} in N such that n = g m_{n,g} g^{-1}. Wait, actually, if N is normal, then g^{-1}Ng = N, so for any n in N, g^{-1}ng is also in N. That means m_{n,g} would be g^{-1}n g. So the existence of such an m is guaranteed because N is normal. Conversely, if for every n in N and g in G, there exists m in N such that g m g^{-1} = n, then N is closed under conjugation, hence normal.\n\nBut the user writes n = g m_{n,g} g^{-1}, which would imply that n is a conjugate of m_{n,g} by g. But since N is normal, m_{n,g} should be in N. Wait, if N is normal, then m_{n,g} = g^{-1} n g, which is in N. So for each n and g, there's an element m in N such that n = g m g^{-1}. \n\nThen, in step (2), the user says N is the union over n in N of the union over g in G of {g m_{n,g} g^{-1}}. But each inner union over g is the conjugacy class of m_{n,g}. Wait, no. The conjugacy class of an element x is {g x g^{-1} | g in G}. So if m_{n,g} is fixed for each g, then the union over g of {g m_{n,g} g^{-1}} would not necessarily be a conjugacy class unless m_{n,g} is fixed as x, but in their notation, m_{n,g} depends on g. That seems problematic. \n\nWait, perhaps there's confusion here. Let me parse their equations again. The user writes:\n\nN is normal ⇨ ∀g∈G, N = gNg^{-1}\n\n⇨ ∀n∈N ∀g∈G ∃m_{n,g}∈N, n = g m_{n,g} g^{-1}\n\nBut actually, the correct translation would be: since N is normal, then for every g∈G, gNg^{-1} = N. Therefore, for any n∈N, g^{-1}n g ∈ N. So for each n∈N and g∈G, there exists m∈N such that g^{-1}n g = m, which implies n = g m g^{-1}. So in their step (1), they have n = g m_{n,g} g^{-1}, but m_{n,g} would be g^{-1} n g. \n\nThen, in step (2), the user writes N as the union over n∈N of the union over g∈G of {g m_{n,g} g^{-1}}. But each {g m_{n,g} g^{-1}} for a fixed n and varying g would actually be the conjugacy class of m_{n,g}. But since m_{n,g} = g^{-1} n g, then g m_{n,g} g^{-1} = n. Wait, that can't be right. If m_{n,g} = g^{-1} n g, then substituting back into g m_{n,g} g^{-1} gives g (g^{-1} n g) g^{-1} = n. So each term in the inner union is just {n}, so the union over g would just be {n}. Therefore, the union over n∈N would be N itself. That would make the step (2) trivial, which is not helpful. \n\nBut the user claims that the inner union is the conjugacy class of n. But if m_{n,g} is varying with g, then the set {g m_{n,g} g^{-1} } might not be the conjugacy class of n. Wait, perhaps there's a miscalculation here. Let's think again.\n\nIf N is normal, then for each n in N, the conjugacy class of n in G, [n], is contained in N. Because if you take any conjugate of n, say g n g^{-1}, since N is normal, this element must be in N. Therefore, all conjugates of n are in N, so [n] is a subset of N. Therefore, N is the union of the conjugacy classes of its elements. Conversely, if N is a subgroup that is the union of conjugacy classes, then for any g in G and n in N, g n g^{-1} is in [n], which is in N. Therefore, N is normal.\n\nThe user's proof attempts to write N as the union over n of the union over g of {g m_{n,g} g^{-1}}, and claims that this union is the conjugacy class of n. However, if m_{n,g} is an element such that n = g m_{n,g} g^{-1}, then m_{n,g} = g^{-1} n g. Therefore, {g m_{n,g} g^{-1} } = {g (g^{-1} n g) g^{-1} } = {n g^{-1} }, which is not correct. Wait, no. Let me compute this again. Suppose m_{n,g} = g^{-1} n g. Then g m_{n,g} g^{-1} = g (g^{-1} n g) g^{-1} = (g g^{-1}) n (g g^{-1}) = e n e = n. So each term in the inner union is just {n}, so the union over g would be {n}, and then the union over n would be N. But the user is trying to express N as the union of conjugacy classes. \n\nThis suggests that the user made a mistake in their reasoning. The correct approach is that since N is normal, each conjugacy class [n] for n in N is contained in N, hence N is the union of these conjugacy classes. Conversely, if N is a union of conjugacy classes, then for any n in N and g in G, g n g^{-1} is in [n], hence in N, so N is normal.\n\nThe user's step (1) to (2) seems flawed because they have the inner union as conjugacy classes of m_{n,g} rather than of n. Therefore, their proof is incorrect in that step. The correct approach is to note that if N is normal, then each [n] is contained in N, so N is the union of [n] for n in N. Conversely, if N is such a union, then conjugation of any element remains in N, hence N is normal.\n\nTherefore, the user's proof attempt is not entirely correct because their step (2) misrepresents the conjugacy classes. They need to fix the logic there, perhaps by noting that each element's conjugacy class is entirely within N, hence N is the union of those classes.\n\nBut according to the user's original question, the task is to structure the problem as per the given format, not to critique the proof. So the user's question is about whether their proof is valid, but the task here is to extract the assumptions and the problem from the given Math Stack Exchange question. \n\nLooking at the original problem: \"Show that a subgroup (of a group) is normal if and only if it is the union of conjugacy classes.\"\n\nThe assumptions would be:\n\n- Let G be a group.\n- Let N be a subgroup of G.\n- The problem is to show that N is normal in G if and only if N is the union of conjugacy classes (of G).\n\nBut according to the example given, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a group,\nN is a subgroup of G,\nConjugacy classes are considered in G.\n\nProblem:\nShow that N is normal in G if and only if N is the union of conjugacy classes.\n\nBut the original problem doesn't have any additional constraints, so the assumptions are just that G is a group, N is a subgroup. The problem is the equivalence between normality and being a union of conjugacy classes.\n\nWait, the example given in the initial instruction had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem, there were no such assumptions. The user in that example perhaps made a mistake or added an assumption that wasn't there. Wait, no. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, the expression is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem listed assumptions as n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect because the original problem didn't have n divisible by 7. The example might have a mistake. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect. Let me check.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption that n is divisible by 7 is incorrect. That suggests that perhaps the example has an error. Wait, but maybe the user who structured the example made a mistake, which complicates things. But according to the instructions, the task is to structure the given problem into Assumption and Problem parts, filtering unrelated info. So in the current problem, the user's question is about a normal subgroup being the union of conjugacy classes.\n\nOriginal question:\n\nTitle: A normal subgroup is the union of conjugacy classes.\n\nQuestion: Exercise 2.6.5: Show that a subgroup (of a group) is normal if and only if it is the union of conjugacy classes.\n\nSo, assumptions here are:\n\n- G is a group (since we're talking about subgroups and conjugacy classes in a group).\n- N is a subgroup of G.\n\nProblem: Show that N is normal in G if and only if N is the union of conjugacy classes.\n\nBut according to the example's format, each assumption is a single condition on one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a group,\nN is a subgroup of G,\nConjugacy classes are considered in G.\n\nBut \"conjugacy classes are considered in G\" is perhaps redundant because the problem is about subgroups of G. Alternatively, maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a group,\nN is a subset of G,\nN is a subgroup of G.\n\nBut the key assumptions are that G is a group, N is a subgroup. The problem is the equivalence between N being normal and N being a union of conjugacy classes.\n\nWait, the problem is about normal subgroups, so the fact that N is a subgroup is given. So the assumptions are:\n\n- G is a group,\n- N is a subgroup of G.\n\nProblem: Show that N is normal in G if and only if N is the union of conjugacy classes of G.\n\nBut conjugacy classes of elements in N, but since conjugacy classes are in G. So the problem is to show that N is normal iff N is a union of some conjugacy classes of G.\n\nTherefore, structuring this:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a group,\nN is a subgroup of G.\n\nProblem:\nShow that N is normal in G if and only if N is the union of conjugacy classes of G.",
