    "Content": "The law of quadratic reciprocity is unquestionably one of the most famous results of mathematics. Carl Gauss, often called the \"Prince of Mathematicians\", referred to it as \"The Golden Theorem\". He published six proofs of it in his lifetime. To date over 200 proofs of this result have been found. The single most frustrating thing about this theorem is that there are no easy proofs of it, at least when measured relative to the simplicity of the statement and the mathematics it involves. For someone like myself, who prides themselves on being able to find very slick proofs, it can drive you insane. As an undergraduate, when confronted with the lattice-point proof in an introductory number theory class, I refused to learn it. I thought to myself there's no way I need to go through all that just to prove something so simple. There must be an easier way. Zolotarev's Proof of the law has been to date the simplest, and quite frankly most elegant, proof that I can find. The crucial step involves equating the value of the Legendre symbol with the signature of the permutation on $\\mathbb{Z}_q$ induced by left multiplication. It can take a little bit longer going through it the first time, but winds up being one of those proofs you can just remember without needing to re-reference it. I had a difficult time finding the result from a single source, at least in a satisfactory form, and had to compile different results from different sources. I thought others might similarly struggle, and so I've typed it below as a resource for them.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Zolotarev's Lemma relates the value of the Legendre symbol to the signature of a permutation of $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ It is stated and proved below, along with its use in what is considered to be a very elegant proof of the quadratic reciprocity law. Zolotarev's Lemma : Let $p$ be an odd prime, $a \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p^\\times $ , and $\\tau_a : \\mathbb{Z_p} \\to \\mathbb{Z_p}$ be the permutation of $\\mathbb{Z_p}$ given by $\\tau_a(x):= ax, \\,$ then $$\\left(\\cfrac{a}{p}\\right) = \\text{sgn}(\\tau_a) $$ Proof: We determine the signature based on the parity of the cycle structure. Note\nthat the signature of a k-cycle is $(-1)^{k-1}$ . Let $m = |a|$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_p^\\times$ . Since $0$ is a singleton orbit (i.e. fixed point) of $\\tau_a$ , and therefore has no effect on its signature, it suffices to proof this for the restriction of $\\tau_a$ to $\\mathbb{Z}_p^\\times$ , as the signature will be the same for both. Each cycle has the form $(x,ax,a^2x,a^3x,\\dots ,a^{m-1}x)$ . Thus\nthe cycle structure consists of $(p-1)/m \\ $ $\\ m$ -cycles, and its signature is therefore given by: $ \\\\ $ $$\n\\text{sgn}(\\tau_a)= \\left((-1)^{m-1}\\right)^{p-1 \\over m} = \n\\begin{cases}\n(-1)^{\\frac{p-1}{m}} & \\mathrm{if} \\ m \\text{ is even} \\\\\n\\\\\n\\ \\ \\ 1 & \\text{if } m \\text{ is odd}\n\\end{cases}\n$$ $ \\\\ $ Recall that $x^2 = 1 \\; (\\text{mod }p) \\implies x = \\pm 1 \\; (\\text{mod }p)$ , and thus if $m$ is even then $a^{m/2} = -1 \\:$ as $ \\ \\frac{m}{2} < m = |a| $ . Consequently, if $m$ is even : $$ a^{\\frac{p-1}{2}} = \\left(a^{\\frac{m}{2}}\\right)^{\\frac{p-1}{m}} = (-1)^{\\frac{p-1}{m}} = \\text{sgn}(\\tau_a)$$ $ \\\\ $ If $m$ is odd, then $(2,m) = 1 \\text{ and } 2,m \\,\\big| \\, p\\!-\\!1 \\implies 2m \\, \\big| \\, p\\!-\\!1 $ and we have: $$a^{\\frac{p-1}{2}} = \\left(a^m \\right)^\\frac{p-1}{2m} = 1^{\\frac{p-1}{2m}} = 1 = \\text{sgn}(\\tau_a)$$ $ \\\\ $ Euler's criterion then finishes the argument. $ \\\\ $ Corollary : If p and q are odd primes, $a \\in \\mathbb{Z}_q$ , and $b \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p $ then $\\left(\\frac{q}{p}\\right)$ and $\\left(\\frac{p}{q}\\right)$ are equal to the signatures of the permutations $x \\mapsto qx + b $ and $x \\mapsto  a + px$ respectively. $ \\\\ $ Proof The argument is symmetric. We shall prove it for $\\left(\\frac{p}{q}\\right)$ . Let $ a \\in \\mathbb{Z}_q$ and define the permutation $\\sigma: \\mathbb{Z}_q \\to \\mathbb{Z}_q$ by $\\sigma(x):= a + x$ . If $ a = 0$ , then $\\sigma = Id$ and $\\text{sgn}(\\sigma) = 1$ . Otherwise, the permutation consists of a single p-cycle, $(x,a+x,2a+x,\\dots,(q-1)a+x)$ and thus sgn $(\\sigma) = 1$ also. Letting $\\tau_p$ be as defined above, the permutation $x \\to a+px$ is equal to the composition $\\sigma \\tau_p$ and thus by Zolotarev's Lemma its signature is $\\text{sgn}(\\sigma \\tau_p) = \\text{sgn}(\\sigma)\\text{sgn}(\\tau_p) = \\text{sgn}(\\tau_p) = \\left(\\frac{p}{q}\\right)$ . $ \\\\ $ The Law of Quadratic Reciprocity : If $p$ and $q$ are odd primes then $$\\left(\\frac{p}{q}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q}{p}\\right) = (-1)^{\\frac{p-1}{2} \\frac{q-1}{2}}$$ Proof Let $\\tau: \\mathbb{Z}_{pq} \\to \\mathbb{Z}_p \\times \\mathbb{Z}_q \\ \\text{ and }\n \\ \\lambda,\\alpha : \\mathbb{Z}_p \\times \\mathbb{Z}_q \\to \\mathbb{Z}_p \\times \\mathbb{Z}_q$ be permutations defined as follows: $$\n\\begin{align}\n\\tau(x):=& \\ (x,x) \\\\\n\\lambda(a,b):=& \\ \\left(a,a\\!+\\!p{}b\\right) \\\\\n\\alpha(a,b):=& \\ \\left(q{}a\\!+\\!b,b\\right)\n\\end{align}\n$$ Now define the permutation $\\varphi: \\mathbb{Z}_{pq} \\to \\mathbb{Z}_{pq}$ by the rule $\\varphi(a+pb):= qa+b$ . This function is well-defined by the Division Algorithm, provided we view it as being defined only on the residues. It is routine to extend this argument to account for the congruence classes in general. Note that $\\varphi = \\tau^{-1} \\circ  \\alpha  \\lambda^{-1}\\! \\circ  \\tau$ and thus $\\text{sgn}(\\varphi) = \\text{sgn}(\\alpha)\\text{sgn}(\\lambda)$ We count the signature of $\\varphi$ in two ways - by its cycle parity and then by its inversions. Looking at $\\lambda$ 's cycle structure, we note that for each $a \\in \\mathbb{Z_p}$ the restriction of $\\lambda$ to $\\{a\\} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_q$ is still a permutation, and its cycle structure is identical to the cycle structure of the permutation $b \\mapsto a+pb$ it induces in its second coordinate. In particular the restriction of $\\lambda$ to $\\{a\\} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_q$ has a signature equal to $\\binom{p}{q}$ . We can then extend this function to the rest of $\\mathbb{Z}_p \\times \\mathbb{Z}_q$ by making it the identity, and we can then view $\\lambda$ as the p-fold composition of these permutations, and thus $\\text{sgn}(\\lambda) = \\left(\\frac{p}{q}\\right)^p = \\left(\\frac{p}{q}\\right)$ . It is best to see this via an example.Similarly, $\\text{sgn}(\\alpha) = \\left(\\frac{q}{p}\\right)$ and thus $$\\text{sgn}(\\varphi) = \\left(\\frac{p}{q}\\right)\\left(\\frac{q}{p}\\right)$$ We now count the inversions. Note that $$a_1 + p{}b_1 < a_2 +p{}b_2 \\text{ and }q{}a_2+b_2 < q{}a_1+b_1 \\implies a_1 - a_2 < p(b_2 - b_1) < p{}q(a_1 - a_2)$$ Since $a_1 - a_2$ gets larger when multiplied by the positive integer $pq$ we must have that $a_1 - a_2 > 0$ which then forces $b_2 - b_1 > 0$ . It can also be seen that this is a sufficient condition for an inversion as well. Thus the pair $\\left(a_1 + pb_1,a_2+pb_2 \\right)$ represents an inversion under $\\varphi$ if and only if $a_1 > a_2 \\text{ and } b_2 > b_1$ . Since given any pair of distinct integers one is necessarily larger than the other, any pair of doubles $(a_1,a_2),(b_1,b_2)$ corresponds to a unique inversion,provided we don't distinguish between $(a_1,a_2) \\text{ and } (a_2,a_1)$ (and similarly for the $b_i$ ).The number of inversions is therefore $$\\binom{p}{2}\\binom{q}{2} = \\frac{p-1}{2}\\frac{q-1}{2} \\,(\\text{mod }2)$$ Equating the two values for $\\text{sgn}(\\varphi)$ gives us our result.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me start by reading through the original problem from Math Stack Exchange. The user is asking about Zolotarev's Lemma and its connection to Quadratic Reciprocity. The title mentions Zolotarev's Lemma and Quadratic Reciprocity, and the question goes into some background about the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity and Zolotarev's proof. The user mentions that the crucial step involves equating the Legendre symbol with the signature of a permutation induced by left multiplication on Z_q. They also mention having compiled different sources to present the proof.\n\nNow, I need to structure this according to the given format. The example provided shows that the Assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object, and then the Problem statement.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions from the problem. The original question states that Zolotarev's Proof involves equating the Legendre symbol (a|q) with the signature of the permutation on Z_q induced by left multiplication. So, the key elements here are the Legendre symbol and the permutation induced by multiplication modulo q. \n\nAssumptions would likely include:\n- The use of the Legendre symbol (a|q), which is a multiplicative character modulo an odd prime q.\n- The permutation on Z_q (the integers modulo q) is induced by left multiplication by a number a.\n- The signature (or sign) of a permutation, which is a group homomorphism from the symmetric group to {±1}.\n\nWait, but the problem is about proving the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity using Zolotarev's Lemma. The user is presenting a resource they compiled. The actual problem to structure might be the statement of Quadratic Reciprocity via Zolotarev's Lemma. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to prove that the Legendre symbol (a|q) equals the signature of the permutation induced by multiplication by a on Z_q, which is Zolotarev's Lemma, and then use that to prove Quadratic Reciprocity.\n\nBut the original question's title and content mention both Zolotarev's Lemma and Quadratic Reciprocity. However, the user's formatted example extracted the problem from the original question. In the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem listed the assumptions (n is integer, n is divisible by 7) and the problem statement.\n\nIn this case, the user's question on Math Stack Exchange is more about the proof of Quadratic Reciprocity using Zolotarev's Lemma, but perhaps the specific problem to structure here is Zolotarev's Lemma itself, which connects the Legendre symbol to the permutation's signature.\n\nLooking back, the crucial step mentioned is equating the Legendre symbol with the signature of the permutation. So perhaps the problem is to prove that for an odd prime q and an integer a not divisible by q, the Legendre symbol (a|q) is equal to the signature of the permutation of Z_q induced by multiplication by a. That would be Zolotarev's Lemma. Then using that lemma to prove the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity.\n\nBut the original question's Problem section would need to be extracted. The user's own problem is not explicitly stated as a \"Prove that...\" but they are compiling the proof. However, the way the example was structured, the user extracted the problem from the original content, even if the original was more narrative.\n\nTherefore, I need to parse the original question and filter out the actual mathematical problem. The key elements are:\n\n1. The Law of Quadratic Reciprocity.\n2. Zolotarev's Proof using permutations on Z_q.\n3. The relation between the Legendre symbol and the signature of the permutation.\n\nThe actual problem that the user is referring to (and which they might want structured) is likely Zolotarev's Lemma itself, which states that the Legendre symbol (a|q) is equal to the signature of the permutation induced by multiplication by a on Z_q. Then, using this lemma to prove Quadratic Reciprocity.\n\nBut the user's question is about presenting the proof, so the problem they are addressing is proving Quadratic Reciprocity using Zolotarev's Lemma. However, the exact problem statement might be to prove the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity via Zolotarev's method, which involves the lemma connecting Legendre symbols to permutation signatures.\n\nAlternatively, if the user is asking for the structured problem of Zolotarev's Lemma, then the assumptions would involve:\n\n- Let q be an odd prime.\n- Let a be an integer not divisible by q.\n- Consider the permutation π on Z_q defined by π(x) = a*x mod q.\n- The signature of a permutation is a homomorphism from the symmetric group to {±1}.\n\nBut the original question mentions that the crucial step is equating the Legendre symbol with the signature. So the problem would be to prove that (a|q) = signature of π.\n\nBut in the example given, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, perhaps the assumptions are about q being an odd prime, a not divisible by q, and considering the permutation induced by multiplication by a on Z_q. Then the problem is to prove that the Legendre symbol (a|q) equals the signature of that permutation.\n\nSo structuring this:\n\nAssumption: q is an odd prime.\nAssumption: a is an integer not divisible by q.\nAssumption: The permutation π on Z_q is defined by π(x) = a*x mod q.\nAssumption: The signature of a permutation is a group homomorphism from the symmetric group to {±1}.\n\nProblem: Prove that the Legendre symbol (a|q) is equal to the signature of the permutation π.\n\nBut wait, in the original example, the user corrected the assumptions to include the divisibility by 7. However, in the original problem, the user had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, that example seems to have an error. Wait, in the original problem, the user wrote:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which actually changes the problem. That might be a mistake in the example. However, perhaps in that example, the user intended to filter out redundant information, but actually added a new condition. Wait, maybe the original problem had a mistake, and the answerer corrected it by noting that n must be divisible by 7? Or maybe the original problem had a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the example is wrong.\n\nBut regardless, following the user's example, even if possibly incorrect, the approach is to list the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nIn the current case, the problem is about Zolotarev's Lemma and Quadratic Reciprocity. The key assumptions would be:\n\n- q is an odd prime.\n\n- a is an integer not divisible by q.\n\n- The permutation on Z_q is induced by left multiplication by a.\n\n- The signature of a permutation is considered.\n\nThe problem is to prove that the Legendre symbol (a|q) equals the signature of this permutation. Alternatively, the problem might be to use this lemma to prove the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity.\n\nLooking at the original question's title: \"Zolotarev's Lemma and Quadratic Reciprocity\". The user is discussing the proof of Quadratic Reciprocity using Zolotarev's Lemma. So the problem is likely to prove the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity using Zolotarev's Lemma. However, Zolotarev's Lemma itself is a separate statement.\n\nBut the example given by the user had the problem as stated in the original, but with some assumptions added. The original example had the problem as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" with the assumption that n is an integer divisible by 7, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". That seems like an error. But perhaps in that case, the user made a mistake. However, since the user provided that example, perhaps they want similar structuring here.\n\nIn the current case, the problem on Math Stack Exchange is asking about the connection between Zolotarev's Lemma and Quadratic Reciprocity, and the user has provided a detailed explanation. To structure the problem, perhaps the key problem is to prove the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity using Zolotarev's Lemma. Alternatively, the problem is to prove Zolotarev's Lemma itself.\n\nThe crucial step mentioned is \"equating the value of the Legendre symbol with the signature of the permutation on Z_q induced by left multiplication\". So, Zolotarev's Lemma is that (a|q) = signature of the permutation given by multiplication by a modulo q.\n\nTherefore, the structured problem would have:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- q is an odd prime.\n\n- a is an integer not divisible by q.\n\n- The permutation π: Z_q → Z_q is defined by π(x) = a·x mod q.\n\n- The signature of a permutation is a group homomorphism from the symmetric group to {±1}.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that the Legendre symbol (a|q) is equal to the signature of the permutation π.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is to prove Quadratic Reciprocity using Zolotarev's Lemma, then the assumptions would include:\n\n- p and q are distinct odd primes.\n\n- The Legendre symbols (p|q) and (q|p).\n\n- Using Zolotarev's Lemma that relates Legendre symbols to permutation signatures.\n\nBut since the title mentions both Zolotarev's Lemma and Quadratic Reciprocity, perhaps the problem is to prove the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity using Zolotarev's Lemma.\n\nBut the example given in the user's message shows that they extracted the problem statement from the original question. The original question in the example was to prove divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem kept that statement but added an assumption about divisibility by 7. In this current case, the original question is about presenting the proof of Quadratic Reciprocity via Zolotarev's method. So perhaps the actual problem to structure is the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity, with assumptions related to the lemma.\n\nBut I need to follow the example's approach. The example took the original problem, which was to prove a divisibility condition for all integers n, and then in the formatted problem, added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. This suggests that perhaps the example is incorrect, or that the user intended to correct the problem. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a hidden assumption.\n\nBut regardless, for the current problem, the user's original question on Math Stack Exchange is about Zolotarev's Lemma and Quadratic Reciprocity, and the task is to structure that problem into assumptions and problem statement.\n\nGiven that, I think the core problem here is to prove the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity using Zolotarev's Lemma. However, the key lemma itself is also a problem. So perhaps structuring the lemma as the problem, and then using it for reciprocity.\n\nBut the user's own problem, which they typed as a resource, is the proof of Quadratic Reciprocity via Zolotarev's method, which involves the lemma. Therefore, the structured problem would be to prove the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity, with assumptions including Zolotarev's Lemma.\n\nAlternatively, if the main mathematical problem is to prove Zolotarev's Lemma, then that would be the problem statement.\n\nLooking back at the original question's content: \"The crucial step involves equating the value of the Legendre symbol with the signature of the permutation on Z_q induced by left multiplication. [...] I've typed it below as a resource for them.\"\n\nSo the user has written a proof that involves Zolotarev's Lemma and its application to Quadratic Reciprocity. Therefore, the problem they are presenting is the proof of Quadratic Reciprocity using Zolotarev's Lemma, which itself requires proving the lemma.\n\nBut since the task is to structure the problem as per the example, I need to identify the problem statement from the user's question.\n\nThe user mentions \"the law of quadratic reciprocity\" and Zolotarev's proof. So the main problem is to prove the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity. The crucial step is using Zolotarev's Lemma, which connects the Legendre symbol to permutation signatures.\n\nTherefore, structuring this:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- p and q are distinct odd primes.\n\n- For an integer a not divisible by p, the Legendre symbol (a|p) is equal to the signature of the permutation on Z_p induced by multiplication by a.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity: (p|q)(q|p) = (-1)^[(p-1)/2 * (q-1)/2].\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is to prove Zolotarev's Lemma itself, then:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- q is an odd prime.\n\n- a is an integer not divisible by q.\n\n- The permutation π on Z_q is defined by π(x) = a*x mod q.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that the Legendre symbol (a|q) is equal to the signature of the permutation π.\n\nGiven the user's example, where they extracted the core problem and added assumptions (even possibly modifying the original problem's conditions), I think the intended structured problem here is to prove Zolotarev's Lemma, as that is the crucial step mentioned. Therefore, the assumptions would be about q being an odd prime, a not divisible by q, the permutation definition, and the problem is to equate the Legendre symbol to the permutation's signature.\n\nSo final answer would be:\n\nAssumption: q is an odd prime.\n\nAssumption: a is an integer not divisible by q.\n\nAssumption: The permutation π: Z_q → Z_q is defined by π(x) ≡ a·x mod q.\n\nAssumption: The signature of a permutation is a group homomorphism from the symmetric group to {±1}.\n\nProblem: Prove that the Legendre symbol (a|q) is equal to the signature of the permutation π.\n\nBut checking if the signature is part of the problem or an assumption. The signature is a standard concept, so maybe it's not an assumption. However, the example included assumptions about divisibility, which are properties of the objects. Here, the key assumptions are about the objects involved: q being an odd prime, a not divisible by q, and the permutation being defined as multiplication by a. The signature is a property of the permutation, so perhaps the last assumption is redundant, as the signature is a defined term. Maybe the assumptions should only list the conditions on the objects, not the definitions of concepts like signature.\n\nSo adjusting:\n\nAssumption: q is an odd prime.\n\nAssumption: a is an integer not divisible by q.\n\nAssumption: The permutation π on Z_q is defined by π(x) = a·x mod q.\n\nProblem: Prove that the Legendre symbol (a|q) is equal to the signature of the permutation π.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might not need the permutation definition as an assumption, since it's part of the problem statement. But in the example, the assumptions listed conditions on n (integer, divisible by 7), not the definition of A(n).\n\nTherefore, in the current case, the problem is to prove that (a|q) equals the signature of π, given that q is an odd prime, a is not divisible by q, and π is defined as multiplication by a modulo q. Therefore, the assumptions are q is an odd prime, a is an integer not divisible by q, and π is defined as such. The problem is to equate the Legendre symbol to the signature.\n\nYes, that makes sense. The definitions of the permutation and the conditions on q and a are the assumptions, and the problem is to prove the equality involving the Legendre symbol and the permutation's signature.",
