    "Content": "I need help with a textbook exercise (Stein's Complex Analysis, Chapter 3, Exercises 9). This exercise requires me to show that\n$$\\int_0^1 \\log(\\sin \\pi x)dx=-\\log2$$\nA hint is given as \"Use the contour shown in Figure 9.\" Since this is an exercise from Chapter 3, I think I should use the residue formula or something like that. But the function $f(x)=\\log(\\sin \\pi x)$ becomes singular on $x=0$ and $x=1$, which makes the contour illegal for the residue theorem. Can anyone give me a further hint on this problem? Many thanks in advance! P.S. This is my first time on Math Stack Exchange. If you find my post ambiguous, let me know.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Consider $$f(z) = \\log(1-e^{2 \\pi zi }) = \\log(e^{\\pi zi}(e^{-\\pi zi}-e^{\\pi zi})) = \\log(-2i) + \\pi zi + \\log(\\sin(\\pi z))$$\nThen we have\n\\begin{align}\n\\int_0^1 f(z) dz & = \\log(-2i) + \\dfrac{i \\pi}2 + \\int_0^1 \\log(\\sin(\\pi z))dz\\\\\n& = \\int_0^1 \\log(\\sin(\\pi z))dz + \\log(-2i) + \\log(i)\\\\\n& = \\log(2) + \\int_0^1 \\log(\\sin(\\pi z))dz\n\\end{align}\nNow it suffices to show that $\\displaystyle \\int_0^1 f(z) dz = 0$. Consider the contour $C(\\epsilon,R)$ (which is the contour given in your question) given by the following. $1$. $C_1(\\epsilon,R)$: The vertical line along the imaginary axis from $iR$ to $i \\epsilon$. $2$. $C_2(\\epsilon)$: The quarter turn of radius $\\epsilon$ about $0$. $3$. $C_3(\\epsilon)$: Along the real axis from $(\\epsilon,1-\\epsilon)$. $4$. $C_4(\\epsilon)$: The quarter turn of radius $\\epsilon$ about $1$. $5$. $C_5(\\epsilon,R)$: The vertical line from $1+i\\epsilon$ to $1 + iR$. $6$. $C_6(R)$: The horizontal line from $1+iR$ to $iR$. $f(z)$ is analytic inside the contour $C$ and hence $\\displaystyle \\oint_C f(z) = 0$. This gives us\n$$\\int_{C_1(\\epsilon,R)} f dz + \\int_{C_2(\\epsilon)} f dz + \\int_{C_3(\\epsilon)} f dz + \\int_{C_4(\\epsilon)} f dz + \\int_{C_5(\\epsilon,R)} f dz + \\int_{C_6(R)} f dz = 0$$ Now the integral along $1$ cancels with the integral along $5$ due to symmetry. Integrals along $2$ and $4$ scale as $\\epsilon \\log(\\epsilon)$. Integral along $6$ goes to $0$ as $R \\to \\infty$. This gives us $$\\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0} \\int_{C_3(\\epsilon)} f dz = 0$$ which is what we need. EDIT @Did has given the standard way to evaluate this integral using real analysis techniques. Here is another way to prove it. From integration by parts / other techniques, we have that $$\\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\sin^{2k}(x) dx = \\frac{2k-1}{2k}\\frac{2k-3}{2k-2} \\cdots \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\dfrac{(2k)!}{4^k (k!)^2} \\dfrac{\\pi}2 = \\dfrac{\\Gamma(2k+1)}{4^k \\Gamma^2(k+1)} \\dfrac{\\pi}2$$ Hence, the analytic extension of $\\displaystyle \\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\sin^{2z}(x) dx $ is $\\dfrac{\\Gamma(2z+1)}{4^z \\Gamma^2(z+1)} \\dfrac{\\pi}2$. (This needs to be justified) Now differentiate both sides with respect to $z$, and set $z=0$, to get $$2 \\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\log(\\sin(x)) = -\\dfrac{\\pi}2 \\log(4)$$\nHence, we get that $$\\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\log(\\sin(x)) dx = -\\dfrac{\\pi}2 \\log(2)$$\nThis also provides you a way to evaluate $\\displaystyle \\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\sin^{n}(x) \\log(\\sin(x)) dx$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to show that the integral of log(sin πx) from 0 to 1 equals -log 2. The original question mentions using a contour from Chapter 9 of Stein's Complex Analysis, probably involving residues. But the function log(sin πx) has singularities at x=0 and x=1 because sin(πx) is zero there, making the logarithm blow up. So the contour might need to avoid those points. \n\nWait, the problem is an exercise from Chapter 3, which covers residues. So maybe we need to relate the real integral to a complex contour integral. Hmm, log(sin πx) is tricky because it's real-valued on the interval (0,1). To use complex analysis, perhaps consider a contour that goes around the interval [0,1] but avoids the singularities. Or maybe use a substitution to transform the integral into a complex integral.\n\nAlternatively, there's a known integral formula for ∫₀^π log(sin x) dx = -π log 2. If we make a substitution here, maybe scaling x to πx would transform the integral into the given form. Let's check: if we let t = πx, then when x=0, t=0; x=1, t=π. Then dx = dt/π. So the integral becomes (1/π) ∫₀^π log(sin t) dt = (1/π)(-π log 2) = -log 2. Oh! That actually solves it directly using the known result. But the problem is from Stein's Complex Analysis, so maybe the intention is to use complex methods instead of real analysis.\n\nWait, but the original question mentions that the integral has singularities at 0 and 1, making the contour \"illegal\" for residue theorem. The user is confused about how to apply residues when the function is singular on the contour. The hint says to use a specific contour, maybe indented around 0 and 1. In complex analysis, when you have singularities on the contour, you can sometimes deform the contour to avoid them, using principal values or indentations. \n\nSo maybe the idea is to consider the integral of log(sin πz) over a contour that's a rectangle or a keyhole around [0,1], but indented at 0 and 1. Then apply the residue theorem to the contour integral. But log(sin πz) has branch points where sin πz is zero, which occurs at all integers. So the complex function is multi-valued with branch points at z = 0, 1, 2, etc. To define a single-valued branch, we need to choose a branch cut, perhaps along the real axis from 0 to 1, but that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the identity sin πz = (e^{iπz} - e^{-iπz})/(2i) and take logarithm, but handling the complex logarithm requires care. Alternatively, consider integrating log(1 - e^{2πi z}) or something similar, as in the derivation of the real integral. But I need to recall how such integrals are handled in complex analysis.\n\nWait, another approach: consider the integral from 0 to 1 of log(sin πx) dx. Let’s make substitution x = t, but maybe extend it to a contour in the complex plane. Alternatively, use symmetry. Since sin(πx) is symmetric around x=1/2, maybe split the integral into two parts from 0 to 1/2 and 1/2 to 1. But that might not help with complex methods.\n\nAlternatively, use Fourier series or expansion of log(sin πx). The Fourier series of log(sin πx) is known, integrating term by term. But that's real analysis again. The user specifically wants a complex analysis approach, as per the textbook's hint.\n\nLet me think. Suppose we consider a contour that is a rectangle in the complex plane, but indented near 0 and 1. Let’s parametrize the contour as follows: from ε to 1 - ε on the real axis, then a small semicircle around 1 - ε to 1 + ε, then back down to ε on the line Im(z) = something? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, use a contour that encloses the interval [0,1] but avoids the points 0 and 1 with small semicircles. Then relate the integral over this contour to residues. But what's the function to integrate?\n\nAlternatively, consider integrating f(z) = log(sin πz) over a rectangle with vertices at 0, 1, 1+iY, and iY, where Y is a large positive number, and then let Y go to infinity. But near z=0 and z=1, the function has singularities, so we need to indent the contour around those points. Then compute the integral over the contour, apply residue theorem, and take limits as the indentations go to zero and Y goes to infinity. But how does that relate to the original integral?\n\nAlternatively, use a substitution to map the interval [0,1] to a contour in the complex plane. For example, use z = e^{2πi x}, which maps x from 0 to 1 to the unit circle. Then the integral becomes an integral over the unit circle, but transformed appropriately. Let's see: if x goes from 0 to 1, then z = e^{2πi x} goes around the unit circle once. Then sin πx = (e^{iπx} - e^{-iπx})/(2i) = (z^{1/2} - z^{-1/2})/(2i). So log(sin πx) becomes log[(z^{1/2} - z^{-1/2})/(2i)] = log(z^{1/2} - z^{-1/2}) - log(2i). But z is on the unit circle, so z^{1/2} is ambiguous unless we choose a branch. This seems complicated, but maybe it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, consider integrating over a contour where z is in the upper half-plane, avoiding the singularities. But I'm not sure. Maybe the key idea is to relate the real integral to an integral over a closed contour via some function whose residues can be calculated.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the integral of log(sin πx) dx from 0 to 1 can be related to the imaginary part of some complex integral. But log(sin πx) is real, so the imaginary part would be zero. Hmm, not helpful.\n\nWait, let's recall that the integral of log(sin x) from 0 to π is -π log 2. This is a standard result, often proved using symmetry and substitution. If we can relate the given integral to that known result, then it's straightforward. But the user's question is about proving it using complex analysis, as per the textbook's hint. So maybe the idea is to use contour integration to derive that known result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the integral of log(sin πz) along a rectangular contour with vertices at 0, 1, 1+iy, and iy, and then take the limit as y approaches infinity. The contributions from the vertical sides might vanish, leading to a relation between the integral from 0 to 1 and some residues. But I need to work through the details.\n\nLet me try to sketch this approach. Let’s define the contour as follows: from 0 to 1 on the real axis (avoiding singularities at 0 and 1 with small semicircles), then up to 1 + iY, then back to iY, then down to 0. Wait, no, maybe a rectangle with vertices at 0, 1, 1+iY, 0+iY. Then integrate log(sin πz) over this contour. However, sin πz has zeros at all integers, so within the contour, there are no zeros except possibly at 0 and 1 if Y is small, but as Y increases, other zeros come in. Hmm, this might not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, consider using a different function related to log(sin πz). Maybe an integral involving cot πz or something else that can be handled via residues. Wait, the residue theorem is often used to evaluate integrals by relating them to sums of residues. Perhaps we need to express the integral of log(sin πx) as part of a contour integral that can be evaluated via residues.\n\nAnother idea: use differentiation under the integral sign. Consider I(a) = ∫₀¹ log(a sin πx) dx, then differentiate with respect to a, but this seems more like real analysis.\n\nAlternatively, express log(sin πx) as an integral itself, then switch the order of integration. For example, log(sin πx) = -∫₀^∞ (e^{-t sin πx} - e^{-t})/t dt, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, going back to the original hint: \"Use the contour shown in Figure 9.\" Since I don't have access to the figure, I need to guess what it might be. Common contours for integrals involving trigonometric functions include the unit circle, rectangles, or indented contours around singularities. Given that the integral is from 0 to 1 and the singularities are at 0 and 1, perhaps the contour is a keyhole contour around the interval [0,1], avoiding the singularities with small circles. Then, the integral over the keyhole would relate to residues inside or outside the contour.\n\nAlternatively, the contour could be a rectangle from 0 to 1 on the real axis, then moving into the complex plane, avoiding 0 and 1 with semicircular indentations. Then, applying the residue theorem to this contour. The function log(sin πz) would have singularities at z = 0 and z = 1, but since those points are excluded by the indentations, the contour would enclose no singularities, leading the integral to be zero. But then how does that help in computing the real integral?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider a different function whose integral over the contour relates to the original integral. For example, consider integrating f(z) = z log(sin πz) over a contour that includes the interval [0,1], but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: use the identity that log(sin πx) = log(2) + log(sin πx) - log(2), but not helpful.\n\nWait, I'm overcomplicating. The key is that the integral from 0 to 1 of log(sin πx) dx can be transformed using substitution. Let’s set t = πx, so x = t/π, dx = dt/π. Then the integral becomes (1/π) ∫₀^π log(sin t) dt. The standard result is that ∫₀^π log(sin t) dt = -π log 2. Hence, multiplying by 1/π gives -log 2. But how to prove ∫₀^π log(sin t) dt = -π log 2 using complex analysis? That might be what the problem wants.\n\nTo prove that using complex methods, perhaps consider the integral over a contour in the complex plane. Let me recall that one standard proof uses Fourier series: expand log(sin t) into a Fourier series and integrate term by term. But complex analysis approach might involve contour integration.\n\nAlternatively, consider integrating log(1 - e^{2it}) / 2i over a contour. Wait, let me recall that sin t = (e^{it} - e^{-it}) / 2i, so log(sin t) = log(e^{it} - e^{-it}) - log(2i). Then, log(sin t) = log(e^{it}(1 - e^{-2it})) - log(2i) = it + log(1 - e^{-2it}) - log(2i). Integrating from 0 to π: ∫₀^π log(sin t) dt = ∫₀^π [it + log(1 - e^{-2it}) - log(2i)] dt. The integral of it from 0 to π is iπ²/2. The integral of -log(2i) over [0, π] is -π log(2i). The integral of log(1 - e^{-2it}) can be handled by expanding the logarithm into a power series: log(1 - e^{-2it}) = -Σ_{n=1}^∞ e^{-2int}/n. Integrating term by term: -Σ_{n=1}^∞ ∫₀^π e^{-2int}/n dt = -Σ_{n=1}^∞ [ (e^{-2inπ} - 1)/(-2in²) ) ] = ... but e^{-2inπ} = 1 for all integers n, so the numerator is zero. Hence, the integral of log(1 - e^{-2it}) from 0 to π is zero. Therefore, the total integral becomes iπ²/2 - π log(2i). But log(2i) = log 2 + iπ/2. So -π log(2i) = -π log 2 - iπ²/2. Adding to the previous term: iπ²/2 - π log 2 - iπ²/2 = -π log 2. So the real integral ∫₀^π log(sin t) dt = -π log 2. Therefore, the original integral is (1/π)(-π log 2) = -log 2. But this uses real analysis with Fourier series, not complex contour integration.\n\nHowever, the problem insists on using complex analysis, so perhaps there's a way to relate this integral to a contour integral. Alternatively, consider integrating log(sin z) over a rectangular contour in the complex plane and relate it to residues. For example, integrate from 0 to π, then up to π + iY, then back to iY, and then down to 0. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, use the substitution z = e^{2i t}, converting the integral into a contour integral around the unit circle. Let’s try that. Let t be from 0 to π, then z = e^{2i t} goes from 1 to -1 around the upper half-circle. Then dt = dz/(2i z). The integral becomes ∫_{1}^{-1} log(sin t) * dz/(2i z). But sin t = (e^{it} - e^{-it}) / (2i) = (z^{1/2} - z^{-1/2}) / (2i). So log(sin t) = log(z^{1/2} - z^{-1/2}) - log(2i). Then, substituting into the integral:\n\n∫_{C} [log(z^{1/2} - z^{-1/2}) - log(2i)] * dz/(2i z)\n\nThis seems complicated due to the square roots and logarithms, which introduce branch cuts. The square root term z^{1/2} has a branch cut, say along the negative real axis. The unit circle contour would intersect this branch cut. Handling this requires careful analysis of the branch cuts and the contour. Maybe this approach isn't the most straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, consider the integral of log(sin z) over a rectangle in the complex plane with vertices at 0, π, π + iY, and iY, then take Y to infinity. Let’s denote this contour as Γ. Inside this contour, the function log(sin z) has singularities where sin z = 0, which occurs at z = 0, π, etc. But by indenting the contour around z=0 and z=π, we can apply the residue theorem. However, log(sin z) has logarithmic singularities at these points, and residues aren't directly applicable because residues are for functions with poles or essential singularities. Logarithmic singularities contribute to integrals but don't have residues in the traditional sense.\n\nAlternatively, differentiate under the integral sign. Let I(a) = ∫₀^π log(a sin t) dt. Then I'(a) = ∫₀^π (sin t / (a sin t)) dt = ∫₀^π (1/a) dt = π/a. Integrating I'(a) from 0 to 1 gives I(1) - I(0) = π log a evaluated from 0 to 1, but I(0) is divergent. This approach might not work directly.\n\nWait, going back to the original problem. The user is working from Stein's Complex Analysis, Chapter 3, which covers residues. The specific integral is ∫₀¹ log(sin πx) dx. The user is concerned about the singularities at 0 and 1 making the contour \"illegal\" for the residue theorem. The hint suggests using a particular contour, which I assume is an indented contour that goes around the points 0 and 1 with small semicircles, thereby avoiding the singularities. \n\nSo, perhaps consider integrating f(z) = log(sin πz) over a contour that goes from ε to 1 - ε along the real axis, then around a semicircle of radius ε at 1, back to 1 - ε, then up into the complex plane, and back down, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, use a contour that includes the real interval [0,1] but is closed in the complex plane, such as a rectangle, with indentations at 0 and 1.\n\nLet’s try to formalize this. Suppose we take a contour that starts at ε (above the real axis), goes to 1 - ε, follows a semicircle around 1 back to 1 - ε (below the real axis), then returns to ε (below), follows a semicircle around 0 back to ε (above), forming a closed loop. Then, applying the residue theorem to this contour. However, since log(sin πz) is analytic inside this contour (if we avoid the branch cuts), the integral around the contour would be zero. But the contributions from the small semicircles would need to be calculated.\n\nAlternatively, consider the integral of the derivative of log(sin πz), which would be π cot πz. But integrating cot πz around a contour might relate to the number of poles inside. However, the integral of log(sin πz) around a closed contour would be related to the residues of its derivative, which is cot πz. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the integral of log(sin πx) from 0 to 1 is real, consider the real part of a complex integral. But this is vague.\n\nAnother approach: use the identity that log(sin πx) = log πx + log(sin πx / πx). The term sin πx / πx approaches 1 as x approaches 0, so this might separate the singular part log πx from the regular part. Then integrate log πx + log(sin πx / πx) from 0 to 1. However, integrating log πx from 0 to 1 gives [x log πx - x] from 0 to 1, which is (1*log π - 1) - (0 - 0) = log π - 1. Then the integral of log(sin πx / πx) from 0 to 1 would need to be computed. But sin πx / πx = product_{n=1}^∞ (1 - x²/n²). Taking the log gives sum_{n=1}^∞ log(1 - x²/n²). Integrating term by term might give a series that sums to something, but this seems complicated and again real analysis.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck on connecting this to complex analysis, perhaps the key is to accept that the integral can be related to the standard result via substitution and that the complex analysis method is a red herring. But the textbook problem specifies using a contour from Figure 9, which I can’t see. However, a common method for integrals like ∫ log(sin x) dx is to use Fourier series or real analysis, but since the problem is in a complex analysis chapter, another method is expected.\n\nWait, another idea: use the integral of log(1 - e^{2πi z}) around a contour. Let’s consider the function f(z) = log(1 - e^{2πi z}). The branch points occur when 1 - e^{2πi z} = 0, which happens when z is an integer. So branch points at all integers. To define a single-valued branch, make a branch cut along the real axis at integers. Then consider integrating f(z) around a contour that encloses the interval [0,1], avoiding the branch points with small circles. Then, applying the residue theorem. But residues require isolated singularities, and branch points are not poles, so residues may not apply.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the integral over the contour is equal to 2πi times the sum of residues inside the contour. But if there are no poles inside, the integral is zero. But how does that relate to the original integral?\n\nAlternatively, relate the integral of log(sin πx) dx to the imaginary part of a complex integral. For example, sin πx = Im(e^{iπx}) / something, but not directly helpful.\n\nHmm, I think I'm going in circles here. Given that I can't see the figure and the standard real analysis proof is straightforward, maybe the complex analysis approach is a more involved version of the real substitution. Given the time I've spent, I think the formatted problem should capture the key assumptions and the problem as stated, filtering out the user's uncertainties and focusing on the core.",
