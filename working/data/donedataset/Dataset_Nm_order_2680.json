    "AcceptedAnswer": "Firstly, $\\dfrac {n}{2\\sqrt{n-1}}$ is an increasing function and $\\geq 1$ for $n\\geq 2$. Let's prove by induction: For $n=2$, it's obvious. Assume it holds for $1,2,...,k-1$. For $n=k;$ If $max(a_1,a_2,\\cdots,a_n)=a_t$ where $t\\gt1$, then because $min(a_i,a_{i+1},\\cdots,a_t,\\cdots,a_n)\\leq min(a_i,a_{i+1},\\cdots,a_{t-1})$ for all $i\\leq t-1$, and $max(a_1,a_2,\\cdots,a_j)=max(a_t,a_{t+1},\\cdots,a_j)$ for all $j\\geq t$, $$\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\max({a_{1},a_{2},\\cdots,a_{i}})\\min{(a_{i},a_{i+1},\\cdots,a_{n}})\\leq \\sum_{i=1}^{t-1}\\max({a_{1},a_{2},\\cdots,a_{i}})\\min{(a_{i},a_{i+1},\\cdots,a_{t-1}})+ \\sum_{j=t}^{n}\\max({a_{t},a_{t+1},\\cdots,a_{j}})\\min{(a_{j},a_{j+1},\\cdots,a_{n}})\\leq (\\cdots by-inductive-hypothesis \\cdots)\\leq \\dfrac{t-1}{2\\sqrt{t-2}}\\sum_{i=1}^{t-1}a^2_{i}+\\dfrac{n-t+1}{2\\sqrt{n-t}}\\sum_{i=t}^{n}a^2_{i}$$ $$\\leq \\dfrac{n}{2\\sqrt{n-1}}\\sum_{i=1}^{t-1}a^2_{i}+\\dfrac{n}{2\\sqrt{n-1}}\\sum_{i=t}^{n}a^2_{i}$$ (If $t=2$, we should rewrite $ \\dfrac{t-1}{2\\sqrt{t-2}}\\sum_{i=1}^{t-1}a^2_{i}$ as $a_1^2$ which is also less or equal to $ \\dfrac{n}{2\\sqrt{n-1}}\\sum_{i=1}^{t-1}a^2_{i}$ If $t=n$, we should rewrite $\\dfrac{n-t+1}{2\\sqrt{n-t}}\\sum_{i=t}^{n}a^2_{i}$ as $a_n^2$ which is also less or equal to $\\dfrac{n}{2\\sqrt{n-1}}\\sum_{i=t}^{n}a^2_{i}$) If $max(a_1,a_2,\\cdots,a_n)=a_1$, then because $\\min{(a_{i},a_{i+1},\\cdots,a_{n}})\\leq a_i $ and also $\\min{(a_{1},a_{2},\\cdots,a_{n}})\\leq \\dfrac {(a_2+a_3+\\cdots+a_n)}{n-1}$ $$\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\max({a_{1},a_{2},\\cdots,a_{i}})\\min{(a_{i},a_{i+1},\\cdots,a_{n}})\\leq a_1\\dfrac {(a_2+a_3+\\cdots+a_n)}{n-1}+\\sum_{i=2}^{n} a_1a_i =\\dfrac{n}{n-1}a_1(a_2+a_3+\\cdots+a_n)=\\dfrac{n}{2\\sqrt{n-1}}\\sum_{i=2}^{n}\\dfrac {2}{\\sqrt{n-1}}a_1a_i\\leq \\dfrac{n}{2\\sqrt{n-1}}\\sum_{i=2}^{n} (\\dfrac{a_1^2}{n-1}+a_i^2)=\\dfrac{n}{2\\sqrt{n-1}}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}a^2_{i}\n $$ So, this finishes the proof.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants me to structure it according to the given format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions and then clearly state the problem.\n\nThe original question is about proving an inequality involving sums of maxima and minima of sequences of positive numbers. Let's go through the problem step by step.\n\nThe title mentions a \"nice inequality\" with a sum involving max and min terms on the left side and a term involving the sum of squares on the right. The actual question starts by specifying that n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2. Then, each a_i is positive, where i ranges from 1 to n. The inequality to show is the sum from i=1 to n of the maximum of (a1, ..., ai) multiplied by the minimum of (ai, ..., an), and this should be less than or equal to (n/(2*sqrt(n-1))) times the sum of the squares of the a_i's.\n\nSo, the assumptions here are:\n\n1. n is a positive integer. The problem states \"n ≥ 2 be a positive integer.\" So that's two conditions: n is an integer, and n ≥ 2. But according to the example, each assumption should address only one property applied to one object. So I need to split that into two separate assumptions: \"n is a positive integer\" and \"n ≥ 2\".\n\n2. Each a_i is positive. The problem says \"a_i > 0, i=1,2,...,n\". Since all a_i are positive, this can be stated as \"a_i > 0 for each i = 1, 2, ..., n\". But again, per the example, each assumption is on one object. So maybe \"a_i are positive real numbers for each i = 1, 2, ..., n\".\n\nNow, checking the example given in the problem, the assumptions were listed line by line, each with one condition. For instance, in the example, the first assumption was \"n is an integer,\" the second was \"n is divisible by 7.\" Here, similarly, the assumptions should be:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n- n ≥ 2.\n- For each i = 1, 2, ..., n, a_i > 0.\n\nSo three assumptions. Then the problem is to show that the sum of max(a1,...,ai)*min(ai,...,an) from i=1 to n is ≤ [n/(2√(n-1))] * sum of a_i².\n\nThe user also mentions maybe using Cauchy-Schwarz, but that's part of the original question's thought process, not part of the problem statement. So in the formatted problem, we should exclude that and just present the problem as is.\n\nWait, the original question includes the user's note about maybe using Cauchy-Schwarz, but according to the instructions, we need to filter out unrelated information. So in the formatted problem, the \"Problem\" part should only include the actual problem statement, not the user's thoughts on how to approach it. So the problem is to show that inequality, and the user's note about using Cauchy-Schwarz is their own thinking, which we can exclude.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumptions:\n- n is a positive integer.\n- n ≥ 2.\n- a_i > 0 for each i = 1, 2, ..., n.\n\nProblem: Show that $$\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\max({a_{1},a_{2},\\cdots,a_{i}})\\min{(a_{i},a_{i+1},\\cdots,a_{n}})\\le\\dfrac{n}{2\\sqrt{n-1}}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}a^2_{i}.$$\n\nLet me double-check if I missed any assumptions. The original problem says \"Let n ≥ 2 be a positive integer, and a_i > 0, i=1,2,...,n.\" So those are the only conditions. The problem is to show the inequality. The user's mention of Cauchy-Schwarz is their own thinking, which we don't include in the problem statement.\n\nYes, that seems correct. The example given by the user split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" into separate assumptions. Here, similarly, splitting \"n is a positive integer\" and \"n ≥ 2\" into two separate lines. Then the positivity of each a_i as another assumption.\n\nSo the final answer should be in the specified format with these assumptions and the problem statement.",
