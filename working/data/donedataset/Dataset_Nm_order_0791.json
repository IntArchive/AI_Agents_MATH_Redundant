    "Content": "I discovered the following conjectured identity numerically (it holds with at least $1000$ digits of precision). How can I prove it?\n$${\\large\\int}_0^\\infty\\left({_2F_1}\\left(\\frac16,\\frac12;\\frac13;-x\\right)\\right)^{12}dx\\stackrel{\\color{#808080}?}=\\frac{80663}{153090}$$ Update: It looks like this hypergeometric function assumes algebraic values at algebraic points (it's only a guess because I have only approximations to those algebraic numbers). Looking at those values, I was able to further conjecture that the hypergeometric function for $x<0$ is actually the following elementary function: $$\n{_2F_1}\\left(\\frac16,\\frac12;\\frac13;x\\right)\\stackrel{\\color{#808080}?}=\n\\\\\n\\frac1{\\sqrt[4]2\\sqrt3}\\cdot\\sqrt{\\frac{\\alpha}{1-x}+\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\n\\sqrt{\\frac{4\\left(\\alpha\\sqrt{2}+2\\right)+x\\left(\\sqrt[3]{4\\beta}-2\\left(\\alpha\\sqrt{2}+4\\right)\\right)+2\\sqrt[3]{2\\beta^2}}{1-x}}}~,\n$$ where $$\\alpha=\\sqrt{2-2x+\\sqrt[3]{2\\beta^2}}~,\\qquad\\beta=x(x-1)~.$$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Consider the hypergeometric equation with parameters $(a,b,c)=\\left(\\frac16,\\frac12,\\frac13\\right)$, and build from its two canonical solutions near $z=0$ the vector\n$$\\vec{y}(z)=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\ny_1 \\\\ y_2\n\\end{array}\\right)=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n_2F_1(a,b;c;z) \\\\ z^{1-c}{}_2F_1(a-c+1,b-c+1;2-c;z)\n\\end{array}\\right).\\tag{1}$$\nThis is a single-valued vector function on $\\mathbb{C}\\backslash\\{(-\\infty,0]\\cup[1,\\infty)\\}$. Its analytic continuation along a closed loop $\\gamma$ gives rise to monodromy representation of $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{C}\\backslash\\{0,1\\})$:\n$$ \\gamma\\mapsto M_{[\\gamma]},\\qquad y(\\gamma z)=M_{[\\gamma]}y(z).$$\nThe monodromy group $G\\subset GL(2,\\mathbb{C})$ of the hypergeometric equation is generated by two matrices corresponding to simple loops around $0$ and $1$. In the case we are interested in these matrices are explicitly given by\n$$M_0=\\left(\\begin{array}{cc} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & e^{-2\\pi i /3}\\end{array}\\right),\\qquad\nM_1=C\\left(\\begin{array}{cc} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & e^{2\\pi i /3}\\end{array}\\right)C^{-1},\\tag{2}$$\nwhere the connection matrix $C=\\left(\\begin{array}{cc} 1 & 2^{\\frac43} \\\\ -2^{\\frac83} & 8\\end{array}\\right)$. If $G$ is finite, then $\\vec{y}(z)$ has a finite number of branches, and moreover (Schwarz 1872), is algebraic. It is not difficult to check that the monodromy group $G$ generated by $M_0$, $M_1$ from (2) is indeed finite. In particular, note that\n$$M_0^3=M_1^3=I,\\qquad M_1^2=-M_0M_1M_0, $$ $$M_1M_0M_1=-M_0^2,\\qquad M_1M_0^2M_1=M_0^2M_1M_0^2.$$ \nIt turns out that $G$ has order $24$ and is isomorphic to the binary tetrahedral group :\n$$G\\cong 2T=\\langle s,t\\,|\\,(st)^2=s^3=t^3\\rangle, $$\nwhere the generators can be identified as $s=M_0M_1M_0M_1M_0$, $t=M_1M_0M_1M_0M_1$. Corollary : The hypergeometric functions in (1) are algebraic. Algebraic solutions of the hypergeometric equations are classified by the so-called Schwarz table , and have been studied by many mathematicians, see e.g. the bibliography in this paper by R.Vidunas. Their explicit construction is somewhat involved but relatively straightforward - at least when the corresponding algebraic curve has genus $0$ (the genus can be determined independently from the Riemann-Hurwitz formula ). In our case the task simplifies even more as our parameter values can be obtained from the genus $0$ tetrahedral formula (2.4) of the above mentioned paper by a combination of a linear trasformation (sending $\\frac56$ to $\\frac43-\\frac56=\\frac12$) and differentiation (transforming $\\frac43$ into $\\frac13$). The result is\n$$_2F_1\\left(\\frac16,\\frac12;\\frac13;-\\frac{r(r+2)^3}{(r+1)(1-r)^3}\\right)=\\frac{\\sqrt{1-r^2}}{2r+1}.$$ Corollary : The antiderivative $\\displaystyle\\int \\mathcal{R}\\left(x,y(x)\\right)dx$, where $y(x)={}_2F_1\\left(\\frac16,\\frac12;\\frac13;-x\\right)$ and $\\mathcal{R}(x,y)$ is rational in both arguments, can be expressed in terms of elementary functions. Example :\nThe transformation $r\\mapsto x(r)=\\frac{r(r+2)^3}{(r+1)(1-r)^3}$ bijectively maps $(0,1)$ to $(0,\\infty)$, and therefore the initial integral becomes\n\\begin{align}\\mathcal{I}&=\\int_0^1 \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{1-r^2}}{2r+1}\\right)^{12}\\left(\\frac{r(r+2)^3}{(r+1)(1-r)^3}\\right)'dr=\\\\&=\n2\\int_0^1 \\frac{(1+r)^4(1-r)^2(r+2)^2}{(2r+1)^{10}} dr=\\\\&=\\frac{80\\,663}{153\\,090}.\n\\end{align}",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to prove this integral involving the hypergeometric function squared twelve times equals 80663/153090. First, I need to parse the original question and filter out the unrelated info.\n\nThe main problem is the integral from 0 to infinity of [2F1(1/6, 1/2; 1/3; -x)]^12 dx equals that fraction. The user also mentions an update where they conjecture an elementary expression for the hypergeometric function when x < 0. But for the original problem, the key elements are the integral, the hypergeometric function parameters, and the conjectured result.\n\nAssumptions here would include the parameters of the hypergeometric function: a=1/6, b=1/2, c=1/3, the variable -x, and the integral's limits from 0 to infinity. Also, the integrand is raised to the 12th power. The problem is to prove this integral equals 80663/153090. The user's conjectured elementary form might be part of their approach but isn't an assumption of the original problem. So, the assumptions should list each parameter of the hypergeometric function and the conditions on the integral. The problem statement is to prove the integral equals that fraction. The hypergeometric function's parameters are each separate assumptions, applied to the function in the integrand.",
