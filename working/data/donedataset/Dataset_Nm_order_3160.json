    "Content": "$H$ is a subgroup of $G$ and $a,b$ are in $G$. I was rather lost for a while but I think I may have\nactually proved it, though I am unsure… Does this make sense? \\begin{aligned}\naH &= bH                              \\\\\n   &\\implies b \\in aH                 \\\\\n   &\\implies \\exists h \\in H : ah = b \\\\\n   &\\implies a^{-1}ah = a^{-1}b       \\\\\n   &\\implies h = a^{-1}b              \\\\\n   &\\implies hb^{-1} = a^{-1}bb^{-1}  \\\\\n   &\\implies hb^{-1} = a^{-1}         \\\\\n\\end{aligned} This means $a^{-1}$ is an element of $Hb^{-1}$, so they are equal. I wasn't quite sure I could do those operations.\nCan anyone tell me where to learn to do the special symbols, like quantifiers and relations because it would make it simpler.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "For formatting, see here and some of the links there. You need to know a bit of LaTeX. As to your argument, it is (mostly) correct. My only quibbles would be of presentation. From $aH=bH$ you conclude that there must exist $h\\in H$ such that $b=ah$. That's fine. Your next step should be that \"there exists $h\\in H$ such that $a^{-1}b=a^{-1}ah = h$\". Then \"There exists $h\\in H$ such that $a^{-1}=a^{-1}bb^{-1}=hb^{-1}$\", hence $a^{-1}$ is in the coset $Hb^{-1}$. Your final statement \"hence they are equal\" is technically wrong, since $a^{-1}$ is not equal to the coset $Hb^{-1}$; what you meant to say is that the since $a^{-1}$ is in $Hb^{-1}$, then the coset $Ha^{-1}$ is equal to the coset $Hb^{-1}$. Other that these quibbles, the argument seems correct to me. Now, to see if you understand it well, try to figure out which, if any, of your implications are reversible, to see if the converse also holds.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question according to the specified structure. First, I need to understand the original question and the example provided.\n\nThe original problem is about proving or finding a counterexample for the statement: If aH = bH, then Ha⁻¹ = Hb⁻¹, where H is a subgroup of G and a, b are elements of G. The user included their attempt, showing steps from aH = bH leading to Ha⁻¹ = Hb⁻¹. They also asked about learning symbols, but that's probably unrelated to the problem itself.\n\nFollowing the example, I need to list all assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then state the problem clearly.\n\nAssumptions here are:\n- H is a subgroup of G.\n- a and b are elements of G.\n- aH equals bH (given in the problem statement).\n\nWait, the problem statement is \"If aH = bH, then Ha⁻¹ = Hb⁻¹\". So the initial condition is aH = bH, which is part of the problem's hypothesis. So in the assumptions, we need to include the general conditions (H is a subgroup, a and b are in G) and the specific condition given (aH = bH). Each assumption on its own line.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nH is a subgroup of G,\na is an element of G,\nb is an element of G,\naH equals bH.\n\nProblem:\nProve or find a counterexample to the statement that Ha⁻¹ equals Hb⁻¹.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"prove or find a counterexample\". So the problem is to do that given the assumptions. The user's attempt is part of their question but not part of the formatted problem. The example given by the user included the problem statement as \"Prove that...\", so here it should be similar.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have assumptions listed as H is subgroup, a and b in G, and aH = bH. Then the problem is to prove or find a counterexample that Ha⁻¹ = Hb⁻¹.\n\nI need to check if there's any other hidden assumptions. For instance, is H required to be normal? The problem doesn't state that. The user's proof attempt doesn't use H being normal, so probably no. So the assumptions are as listed.\n\nSo putting it together:\n\nAssumption:\nH is a subgroup of G,\na is an element of G,\nb is an element of G,\naH equals bH.\n\nProblem:\nProve or find a counterexample to the statement that Ha⁻¹ equals Hb⁻¹.\n\nYes, that seems to fit the required format. The example given had the problem as \"Prove that...\", so here it's similar but includes the \"prove or find a counterexample\" directive. The user's own steps are part of their question but not part of the formatted problem.",
