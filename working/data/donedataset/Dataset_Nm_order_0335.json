    "Content": "I'm reading Galois Theory by Steven H. Weintraub (second edition), and finding that I'm at least somewhat short on the prerequisites. However the following proof looks wrong to me - am I misunderstanding something, or is it actually an incorrect proof? Lemma 2.2.3 . Let $F$ be a field and $R$ an integral domain that is a finite-dimensional $F$ -vector space. Then $R$ is a field. Proof . We need to show that any nonzero $r \\in R$ has an inverse. Consider $\\{1, r, r^2, \\cdots\\}$ . This is an infinite set of elements of $R$ , and by hypothesis $R$ is finite dimensional as an $F$ -vector space, so this set is linearly dependent. Hence $\\sum_{i=0}^n{c_i r^i} = 0$ for some $n$ and some $c_i \\in F$ not all zero. It then goes on to show, given the above, that we can derive an inverse for $r$ . However, if I consider examples like $r = 2 \\in Q[\\sqrt{2}]$ , $r = \\sqrt{2} \\in Q[\\sqrt{2}]$ or $r = 2 \\in Q[X]/{<X^2>}$ , the set $\\{1, r, r^2, ...\\}$ doesn't look linearly dependent to me. I do believe the lemma is true (and might even be able to prove it), but this does not look like a correct proof to me. Am I missing something? [Edit] Well yes, I am. Somehow I had managed to discount the possibility of any $c_i$ being negative, despite repeatedly looking at each fragment of the quoted text in an attempt to find what I might be misunderstanding.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "$\\{1,2,4,8,\\ldots\\}$ is certainly $\\mathbb{Q}$-linearly dependent in $\\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{2}]$; in fact, it is linearly dependent in $\\mathbb{Q}$ already! $0 = 2(1) -1(2)$, with the elements in parentheses being the vectors. So this is a nontrivial linear combination of the vectors in the set which is equal to $0$. For $\\sqrt{2}$, the set is $\\{1,\\sqrt{2},2,2\\sqrt{2},4,\\ldots\\}$. Again, this is $\\mathbb{Q}$-linearly dependent, since $0 = 2(1) + 0(\\sqrt{2}) -1(2)$.  Again, this is a nontrivial linear combination of the vectors in the set which is equal to $0$. What is it that makes it look \"not dependent\" to you?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So the user is asking about the proof that an integral domain which is a finite-dimensional vector space over a field F is actually a field. They mentioned that the proof in the book by Weintraub seems incorrect to them, especially with some examples. Let me parse this step by step.\n\nFirst, the lemma states: Let F be a field and R an integral domain that is a finite-dimensional F-vector space. Then R is a field. The proof provided in the book argues that for any nonzero r in R, the set {1, r, r^2, ...} must be linearly dependent because R is finite-dimensional over F. Therefore, there's a polynomial equation with coefficients in F that r satisfies, allowing us to solve for an inverse.\n\nThe user gives examples where they think the set {1, r, r^2, ...} might not be linearly dependent. For instance, r = 2 in Q[√2], r = √2 in Q[√2], and r = 2 in Q[X]/<X^2>. Wait, but Q[√2] is a 2-dimensional vector space over Q. So, any element in Q[√2] can be expressed as a + b√2 where a, b are in Q. Let's take r = 2. Then the set {1, 2, 4, 8, ...} should be linearly dependent over Q. Since the vector space is 2-dimensional, any three elements must be linearly dependent. So 1, 2, 4 would have a linear combination c0*1 + c1*2 + c2*4 = 0 with coefficients in Q, not all zero. Let's see: For example, 2*1 -1*2 = 0, but that's only two terms. Wait, but the set {1, 2, 4} would have a relation. Let's see if there's a non-trivial combination. Let's suppose c0 + 2c1 +4c2=0. If I pick c0 = -2c1 -4c2. Let's choose c1=2, c2=-1. Then c0 = -4 +4=0. So 0*1 +2*2 -1*4 = 0. Which gives 0 +4 -4=0. So yes, there's a non-trivial linear combination. So indeed, {1, 2, 4} are linearly dependent. So even for r=2, the powers of r will generate a linearly dependent set. Therefore, the proof's reasoning applies here. \n\nSimilarly, for r=√2 in Q[√2], the set {1, √2, (√2)^2=2, (√2)^3=2√2, ...}. Again, since the vector space is 2-dimensional, any three elements must be dependent. For example, 1, √2, 2: Here, 1*2 -2*1 =0, but that's not involving √2. Wait, maybe another combination. Alternatively, since √2 is a root of x^2 -2=0, so 1*(√2)^2 -2*1=0. That's a linear combination of 1 and (√2)^2. So the set {1, √2, (√2)^2} would have the relation 1*(√2)^2 -2*1 =0, which shows linear dependence. Thus, the proof's logic works here.\n\nThen the third example: r=2 in Q[X]/<X^2>. Wait, Q[X]/<X^2> is a ring where X^2=0. So elements are of the form a + bX. Then r=2 would be 2 +0X. The powers of r: (2)^0=1, (2)^1=2, (2)^2=4, etc. But in this ring, 2 is just a scalar. So {1, 2, 4, 8, ...} as elements in Q[X]/<X^2>. But here, the ring is 2-dimensional over Q, so again, any three elements must be linearly dependent. For instance, 1, 2, 4 are scalars in Q, so they are in Q, which is 1-dimensional. Thus, 2 is a scalar multiple of 1, and 4 is 2 squared. But in Q, all these are linearly dependent. For example, 2*2 -4*1=0. So again, there is a linear dependence.\n\nWait, but Q[X]/<X^2> is not an integral domain, right? Because X*X=0, but X ≠0. So the third example the user gives, r=2 in Q[X]/<X^2>, but R here is Q[X]/<X^2>, which is not an integral domain. Therefore, the lemma doesn't apply to that case because the lemma requires R to be an integral domain. So that example is not a valid counterexample because R isn't an integral domain. Therefore, the user might have misunderstood the conditions. The lemma applies only when R is an integral domain and a finite-dimensional F-vector space. The example with Q[X]/<X^2> is not an integral domain, so it's outside the lemma's scope.\n\nSo the user's confusion might arise from considering examples where R is not an integral domain. But in the lemma, R is given as an integral domain. Therefore, the proof should hold under those conditions.\n\nThe user then mentions that they realized they had missed the possibility of negative coefficients. Wait, the coefficients are in F, which is a field, so they can take any scalar, including negative ones. But in the linear dependence, coefficients can be positive, negative, or zero. However, in the proof, you get a polynomial equation with coefficients in F, which allows solving for the inverse. For example, if you have c0 + c1 r + ... + cn r^n =0, then you can factor out r and rearrange to find an inverse.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the assumptions in the problem would be:\n\n- F is a field.\n- R is an integral domain.\n- R is a finite-dimensional vector space over F.\n\nThe problem is to prove that R is a field under these assumptions.\n\nThe user's examples either are in integral domains (like Q[√2]) where the proof works, or in non-integral domains (like Q[X]/<X^2>) where the lemma doesn't apply. So the key assumptions are that R is an integral domain and a finite-dimensional F-vector space. The problem is to show R is a field.",
