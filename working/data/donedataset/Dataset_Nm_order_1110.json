    "Content": "Exercise 1: Let $\\mu_n$ , $\\mu$ be probability measures on $\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathcal{B}\\left(\\mathbb{R}\\right)\\right)$ with distribution functions $F_n$ , $F$ . Show: If $\\left(\\mu_n\\right)$ converges weakly to $\\mu$ and $F$ is continuous, then $\\left(F_n\\right)$ converges uniformly on $\\mathbb{R}$ to $F$ . This is a problem that I am totally stuck at. I know the fact that $F_n$ converges pointwise to $F$ in this question. Also, I looked through Google and found out that I have to show first that $F_{n}(t_{n})$ converges to $F(t)$ if $t_{n}$ converges to $t$ . But, no matter how I tried, I keep failing to prove the fact.\nAlso, I have no idea how to use the fact to get the uniform convergence. So I'm just stymied. Could anyone please help me with this? Add : I managed to show that $F_n$ converges uniformly to $F$ on any compact intervals. However, the generalization to the whole real line is still not solved...Could anyone at least help me with the generalization to the real line?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Fix $\\epsilon>0$. Since $F$ is a distribution function, there exists $R >0$ such that $F(r) \\leq \\epsilon$ for all $r \\leq -R$ and $F(r) \\geq 1-\\epsilon$ for all $r \\geq R$. As $F_n \\to F$ pointwise, we can choose $N \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $$|F_n(-R) - F(-R)| \\leq \\epsilon \\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad |F_n(R)-F(R)| \\leq \\epsilon$$ for all $n \\geq N$. Hence, by the monotonicity of $F_n$ and $F$, $$\\begin{align*} |F_n(r)-F(r)| \\leq |F_n(r)|+|F(r)| &\\leq F_n(-R)+F(-R) \\\\ &= (F_n(-R)-F(-R)) + 2 F(-R) \\\\ &\\leq 3\\epsilon \\tag{1} \\end{align*}$$ for all $r \\leq -R$. Similarly, it follows from $$1 \\geq F_n(r) \\geq F_n(R) = (F_n(R)-F(R))+F(R) \\geq 1-2\\epsilon, \\qquad r \\geq R,$$ that $$|F_n(r)-F(r)| \\leq |F_n(r)-(1-\\epsilon))|+ |F(r)-(1-\\epsilon)| \\leq 2 \\epsilon \\tag{2}$$ for all $r \\geq R$. Combining $(1)$ and $(2)$ yields $$\\sup_{r \\in [-R,R]^c} |F_n(r)-F(r)|  \\leq 3 \\epsilon$$ for all $n \\geq N$. Since you have already shown that $F_n$ converges to $F$ uniformly on compact intervals, there exists $N' \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $$\\sup_{r \\in [-R,R]} |F_n(r)-F(r)| \\leq \\epsilon$$ for all $n \\geq N'$. Setting $\\tilde{N} := \\max\\{N,N'\\}$, we get $$\\sup_{r \\in \\mathbb{R}} |F_n(r)-F(r)| \\leq 3 \\epsilon \\qquad \\text{for all $n \\geq N$}.$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem properly. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into their specified format. The example they provided involved breaking down the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nLooking at the original problem here: The question is about weak convergence of probability measures implying uniform convergence of their distribution functions when the limit distribution function is continuous. The user mentioned they've already shown pointwise convergence and uniform convergence on compact intervals but are stuck on extending it to the entire real line.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions. The problem states that μ_n and μ are probability measures on (R, B(R)) with distribution functions F_n and F. The conditions given are that μ_n converges weakly to μ and F is continuous. The task is to show that F_n converges uniformly to F on R.\n\nSo, breaking down the assumptions:\n\n1. μ_n are probability measures on (R, B(R)) with distribution functions F_n.\n2. μ is a probability measure on (R, B(R)) with distribution function F.\n3. (μ_n) converges weakly to μ.\n4. F is continuous.\n\nEach of these should be separate lines in the assumptions. The problem statement is to prove that F_n converges uniformly to F on R.\n\nWait, the user also mentioned they managed to show uniform convergence on compact intervals but not on the whole real line. However, the original problem statement doesn't include that as an assumption; that's part of their attempt. So in the formatted problem, we should only include the given assumptions, not the user's partial progress.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are exactly the four points I listed. Each is a single condition applied to specific objects: μ_n, μ, weak convergence, and continuity of F.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nμ_n is a probability measure on (ℝ, B(ℝ)) with distribution function F_n,\nμ is a probability measure on (ℝ, B(ℝ)) with distribution function F,\n(μ_n) converges weakly to μ,\nF is continuous.\n\nProblem:\nShow that (F_n) converges uniformly on ℝ to F.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is on a separate line and addresses only one property. Let me check again. The first two lines define μ_n and μ as probability measures with their respective distribution functions. The third line is the weak convergence. The fourth line is the continuity of F. That seems correct. The problem statement is to show uniform convergence. The user's mention of compact intervals is part of their attempt, not the original problem's assumptions, so we exclude that.",
