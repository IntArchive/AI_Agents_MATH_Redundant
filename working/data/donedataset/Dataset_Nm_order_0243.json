    "Content": "Is there any way to show that $$\\sum\\limits_{k =  - \\infty }^\\infty  {\\frac{{{{\\left( { - 1} \\right)}^k}}}{{a + k}} = \\frac{1}{a} + \\sum\\limits_{k = 1}^\\infty  {{{\\left( { - 1} \\right)}^k}\\left( {\\frac{1}{{a - k}} + \\frac{1}{{a + k}}} \\right)}=\\frac{\\pi }{{\\sin \\pi a}}} $$ Where $0 < a = \\dfrac{n+1}{m} < 1$ The infinite series is equal to $$\\int\\limits_{ - \\infty }^\\infty  {\\frac{{{e^{at}}}}{{{e^t} + 1}}dt} $$ To get to the result, I split the integral at $x=0$ and use the convergent series in $(0,\\infty)$ and $(-\\infty,0)$ respectively: $$\\frac{1}{{1 + {e^t}}} = \\sum\\limits_{k = 0}^\\infty  {{{\\left( { - 1} \\right)}^k}{e^{ - \\left( {k + 1} \\right)t}}} $$ $$\\frac{1}{{1 + {e^t}}} = \\sum\\limits_{k = 0}^\\infty  {{{\\left( { - 1} \\right)}^k}{e^{kt}}} $$ Since $0 < a < 1$ $$\\eqalign{\n  & \\mathop {\\lim }\\limits_{t \\to 0} \\frac{{{e^{\\left( {k + a} \\right)t}}}}{{k + a}} - \\mathop {\\lim }\\limits_{t \\to  - \\infty } \\frac{{{e^{\\left( {k + a} \\right)t}}}}{{k + a}} = \\frac{1}{{k + a}}  \\cr \n  & \\mathop {\\lim }\\limits_{t \\to \\infty } \\frac{{{e^{\\left( {a - k - 1} \\right)t}}}}{{k + a}} - \\mathop {\\lim }\\limits_{t \\to 0} \\frac{{{e^{\\left( {a - k - 1} \\right)t}}}}{{k + a}} =  - \\frac{1}{{a - \\left( {k + 1} \\right)}} \\cr} $$ A change in the indices will give the desired series. Although I don't mind direct solutions from tables and other sources, I prefer an elaborated answer. Here's the solution in terms of $\\psi(x)$. By separating even and odd indices we can get $$\\eqalign{\n  & \\sum\\limits_{k = 0}^\\infty  {\\frac{{{{\\left( { - 1} \\right)}^k}}}{{a + k}}}  = \\sum\\limits_{k = 0}^\\infty  {\\frac{1}{{a + 2k}}}  - \\sum\\limits_{k = 0}^\\infty  {\\frac{1}{{a + 2k + 1}}}   \\cr \n  & \\sum\\limits_{k = 0}^\\infty  {\\frac{{{{\\left( { - 1} \\right)}^k}}}{{a - k}}}  = \\sum\\limits_{k = 0}^\\infty  {\\frac{1}{{a - 2k}}}  - \\sum\\limits_{k = 0}^\\infty  {\\frac{1}{{a - 2k - 1}}}  \\cr} $$ which gives $$\\sum\\limits_{k = 0}^\\infty  {\\frac{{{{\\left( { - 1} \\right)}^k}}}{{a + k}}}  = \\frac{1}{2}\\psi \\left( {\\frac{{a + 1}}{2}} \\right) - \\frac{1}{2}\\psi \\left( {\\frac{a}{2}} \\right)$$ $$\\sum\\limits_{k = 0}^\\infty  {\\frac{{{{\\left( { - 1} \\right)}^k}}}{{a - k}}}  = \\frac{1}{2}\\psi \\left( {1 - \\frac{a}{2}} \\right) - \\frac{1}{2}\\psi \\left( {1 - \\frac{{a + 1}}{2}} \\right) + \\frac{1}{a}$$ Then $$\\eqalign{\n  & \\sum\\limits_{k =  - \\infty }^\\infty  {\\frac{{{{\\left( { - 1} \\right)}^k}}}{{a + k}}}  = \\sum\\limits_{k = 0}^\\infty  {\\frac{{{{\\left( { - 1} \\right)}^k}}}{{a + k}}}  + \\sum\\limits_{k = 0}^\\infty  {\\frac{{{{\\left( { - 1} \\right)}^k}}}{{a - k}}}  - \\frac{1}{a} =   \\cr \n  &  = \\left\\{ {\\frac{1}{2}\\psi \\left( {1 - \\frac{a}{2}} \\right) - \\frac{1}{2}\\psi \\left( {\\frac{a}{2}} \\right)} \\right\\} - \\left\\{ {\\frac{1}{2}\\psi \\left( {1 - \\frac{{a + 1}}{2}} \\right) - \\frac{1}{2}\\psi \\left( {\\frac{{a + 1}}{2}} \\right)} \\right\\} \\cr} $$ But using the reflection formula one has $$\\eqalign{\n  & \\frac{1}{2}\\psi \\left( {1 - \\frac{a}{2}} \\right) - \\frac{1}{2}\\psi \\left( {\\frac{a}{2}} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi }{2}\\cot \\frac{{\\pi a}}{2}  \\cr \n  & \\frac{1}{2}\\psi \\left( {1 - \\frac{{a + 1}}{2}} \\right) - \\frac{1}{2}\\psi \\left( {\\frac{{a + 1}}{2}} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi }{2}\\cot \\frac{{\\pi \\left( {a + 1} \\right)}}{2} =  - \\frac{\\pi }{2}\\tan \\frac{{\\pi a}}{2} \\cr} $$ So the series become $$\\eqalign{\n  & \\sum\\limits_{k =  - \\infty }^\\infty  {\\frac{{{{\\left( { - 1} \\right)}^k}}}{{a + k}}}  = \\frac{\\pi }{2}\\left\\{ {\\cot \\frac{{\\pi a}}{2} + \\tan \\frac{{\\pi a}}{2}} \\right\\}  \\cr \n  & \\sum\\limits_{k =  - \\infty }^\\infty  {\\frac{{{{\\left( { - 1} \\right)}^k}}}{{a + k}}}  = \\pi \\csc \\pi a \\cr} $$ The last being an application of a trigonometric identity.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example they provided shows that the Assumptions section should list each condition on one line, focusing on one property per line applied to a single object. The Problem section should clearly state what needs to be proven or solved.\n\nLooking at the original problem here: The title is about simplifying a sum that equals π/(sin πa). The user's question includes a lot of steps they've taken, like splitting integrals, using series expansions, and involving the digamma function ψ(x). But I need to filter out the unnecessary details and just extract the core assumptions and problem.\n\nFirst, the problem statement in the original question is to show that the infinite sum ∑_{k=-∞}^∞ [(-1)^k / (a + k)] equals π/(sin πa). They also mention that 0 < a = (n+1)/m < 1. That seems like an important condition on 'a'. So, the assumptions would include that 'a' is a real number between 0 and 1, expressed as (n+1)/m where n and m are integers. Wait, but does the problem specify that n and m are integers? The original question says \"0 < a = (n+1)/m < 1\", which implies that n and m are integers such that this fraction is between 0 and 1. So maybe the assumption is that 'a' is a rational number of that form. However, in the final result, the identity holds for any 'a' in (0,1), not necessarily rational. But the user specified 0 < a = (n+1)/m < 1. Hmm, maybe that's part of their original problem's context. But perhaps in the general case, 'a' is any non-integer in (0,1). The user might have included a specific form for 'a', so I need to check.\n\nLooking back at the original question: \"Where 0 < a = (n+1)/m < 1\". So they're defining 'a' as (n+1)/m, which suggests that n and m are integers such that this fraction is between 0 and 1. So that's an assumption about 'a'. So that should be listed as an assumption. So the assumptions are:\n\n- a is a real number such that 0 < a < 1.\n- a is equal to (n+1)/m where n and m are integers. (But wait, maybe they don't need to specify n and m? The problem statement might just take 'a' as given in that interval. However, the user wrote \"0 < a = (n+1)/m < 1\", so that's part of the problem's conditions. So the assumption is that a is a rational number of the form (n+1)/m with integers n, m. Wait, but (n+1)/m being between 0 and 1 implies that m > n+1, and n+1 and m are positive integers? Maybe. But perhaps the key assumption is that 0 < a < 1 and a is not an integer, because the sum would have poles otherwise. The problem statement's main condition is on 'a' being between 0 and 1. The mention of (n+1)/m might be part of their specific case, but perhaps the problem is more general. Wait, in the problem statement they wrote \"Where 0 < a = (n+1)/m < 1\", so this is part of their original problem. Therefore, the assumptions should include that a is defined as (n+1)/m with 0 < a < 1. But maybe the problem is to show that the sum equals π/sin πa given that a is in (0,1), regardless of being rational. But the user wrote a = (n+1)/m. So perhaps they're considering a rational number here. However, in the answer, they use the reflection formula and trig identities, which don't necessarily require 'a' to be rational. Therefore, maybe the user is mistaken in restricting 'a' to (n+1)/m, but in the problem's correct statement, 'a' is any non-integer in (0,1). But since the user included that a = (n+1)/m, I should follow their problem's given assumptions.\n\nSo, the assumptions would be:\n\n- a is a real number such that 0 < a < 1.\n- a is defined as (n + 1)/m, where n and m are integers.\n\nWait, but if a = (n+1)/m, then m must be greater than n+1 to have a < 1. But perhaps the user didn't need to specify n and m. Alternatively, maybe the original problem has a typo or misstatement. However, given the user's original question, the key assumptions are 0 < a < 1 and a is of that form. But maybe the problem is general, and the user is considering that specific case. Alternatively, maybe the main assumption is that a is not an integer and 0 < a < 1, and the (n+1)/m part is the user's context. However, in the example given in the instruction, the assumption was \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem didn't state that. Wait, no, the example shows that the formatted problem corrected the assumptions. Wait, in the example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That suggests that the user (the assistant) might have made an error, but the example shows that sometimes assumptions are added to correct the problem. Wait, perhaps the example was a mistake. Let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal problem example: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. So the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Unless the original problem had a typo, but according to the example, the assistant restructured the problem with additional assumptions. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect. But regardless, following the user's instruction, I need to list all assumptions from the original problem. In the current problem, the user wrote \"Where 0 < a = (n+1)/m < 1\", so that's their given condition. So the assumption is that a is a rational number in (0,1) expressed as (n+1)/m. But perhaps more accurately, the problem is valid for any a in (0,1), and the user's specific case uses a rational a. But in the problem statement, they mention \"0 < a = (n+1)/m < 1\", so that's part of the problem's assumption. So the assumptions are:\n\n- a is a real number such that 0 < a < 1.\n- a is given by (n + 1)/m, where n and m are integers.\n\nBut perhaps the second assumption is redundant if a is already between 0 and 1. Alternatively, maybe the key is that a is not an integer. Wait, if a is between 0 and 1, it's already not an integer. So maybe the only assumption is 0 < a < 1, and the (n+1)/m part is just the user's parameterization. However, since the user included that in their problem statement, I should include it. But in the problem statement, the equality to π/sin πa holds for any non-integer a, but the user restricts to 0 < a < 1. So the main assumptions here are:\n\n- a is a real number.\n- 0 < a < 1.\n- a is not an integer (though this is implied by 0 < a < 1 if a is real, but perhaps explicitly stated).\nWait, but if a is in (0,1), then it's not an integer. So maybe the assumption is simply 0 < a < 1. The (n+1)/m part might be the user's specific case, but perhaps it's better to omit that unless it's crucial. Wait, looking back at the original question, the user wrote:\n\n\"Where 0 < a = \\dfrac{n+1}{m} < 1$ The infinite series is equal to $$\\int\\limits_{ - \\infty }^\\infty  {\\frac{{{e^{at}}}}{{{e^t} + 1}}dt} $$\"\n\nSo they define 'a' as (n+1)/m where 0 < a < 1. So the assumption is that a is rational? Because n and m are integers, but maybe not necessarily. For example, m could be any positive integer and n an integer such that 0 < (n+1)/m < 1. So perhaps the user is working with a rational number a in (0,1). However, the problem's result π/sin πa holds for any complex a not an integer, but in the context, it's real and in (0,1). So perhaps the key assumptions are:\n\n- a is a real number.\n- 0 < a < 1.\n\nBecause even if a is irrational, the identity still holds. So maybe the (n+1)/m part is the user's way of parameterizing a, but it's not necessary for the general problem. Therefore, to structure the problem correctly, perhaps the assumption is:\n\n- a is a real number such that 0 < a < 1.\n\nBut the user's problem statement includes a = (n+1)/m. So perhaps I should include both:\n\nAssumption:\na is a real number such that 0 < a < 1,\na is defined as (n + 1)/m where n and m are integers.\n\nBut since the problem is about proving the sum equals π/(sin πa), which is valid for any a not integer in (0,1), maybe the (n+1)/m part is redundant. However, the user included it in their original problem, so it's part of the problem's assumptions. Therefore, the formatted assumptions would include both conditions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in including (n+1)/m, and the correct assumption is 0 < a < 1. But without more context, I should stick to what the user provided.\n\nLooking at the example given, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake, but maybe the example was incorrect. However, in this case, the user's original problem states \"0 < a = (n+1)/m < 1\", so we need to include that as an assumption.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\na is a real number,\n0 < a < 1,\na is defined as (n + 1)/m where n and m are integers.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum\\limits_{k =  - \\infty }^\\infty  {\\frac{{{{\\left( { - 1} \\right)}^k}}}{{a + k}} = \\frac{\\pi }{{\\sin \\pi a}}$$\n\nWait, but the problem statement in the original question includes two expressions for the sum: the first is the sum from -infty to infty, then rewritten as 1/a + sum from k=1 to infty of (-1)^k (1/(a -k) + 1/(a +k)), and that equals π/sin πa. So the problem is to show that the series equals π/sin πa. The user also mentions integrating e^(at)/(e^t +1) from -infty to infty, but that's part of their solution approach, not the problem statement. The core problem is the equality of the sum and π/(sin πa).\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- a is a real number.\n- 0 < a < 1.\n\nBut the user's original problem says \"0 < a = (n+1)/m < 1\", so including that in the assumptions. However, mathematically, the identity holds for any a in (0,1), not necessarily rational. So perhaps the user is mistaken in specifying a as (n+1)/m, but since it's part of their problem statement, we should include it. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to define a as a rational number in that interval. In that case, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\na is a rational number,\n0 < a < 1,\na is expressed as (n + 1)/m where n and m are integers.\n\nBut the problem's conclusion doesn't depend on a being rational, so perhaps the user's parameterization is unnecessary. But since it's in their problem statement, we must include it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct assumption is simply 0 < a < 1, and the rest is part of the problem's context but not an assumption. But given the example provided by the user, where they added an assumption not present in the original problem, perhaps in this case, the assistant should list all necessary assumptions as per the problem's requirement. The problem's key assumption is that a is in (0,1) and not an integer, ensuring the series converges and the identity holds. But the user wrote a = (n+1)/m, so we need to include that.\n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. To make progress, I'll list the assumptions as:\n\nAssumption:\na is a real number such that 0 < a < 1,\na is defined as (n + 1)/m where n and m are integers.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum\\limits_{k =  - \\infty }^\\infty  {\\frac{{{{\\left( { - 1} \\right)}^k}}}{{a + k}} = \\frac{\\pi }{{\\sin \\pi a}}$$\n\nBut I need to check if the definition of a as (n+1)/m is necessary for the problem. If the identity holds for any a in (0,1), then the assumption about a being rational might be superfluous. However, since the user included it, it's better to include it as per their problem statement. So in their case, they might be considering a specific case where a is rational, but the general proof works for any a in (0,1). But following the user's original problem, we have to structure it as they presented.",
