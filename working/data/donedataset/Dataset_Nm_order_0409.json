    "Content": "The competition has ended 6 june 2014 22:00 GMT\nThe winner is  Bryan Well done ! When I was rereading the proof of  the drinkers paradox (see Proof of Drinker paradox I realised that $\\exists x \\forall y (D(x) \\to D(y)) $ is also a theorem. I managed to proof it in 21 lines (see below), but I am not sure if this is the shortest possible proof. \nAnd I would like to know are there shorter versions? That is the reason for this competition (see also below) Competition rules This is a small competition, I will give the person who comes with the shortest proof (shorter than the proof below ) a reward of 200 (unmarked) reputation points. ( I can only add a bounty in  a couple of days from now , but you may already start to think about how to prove it, and you may allready post your answer. The length of a proof is measured by the number of numbered lines in the proof (see the proof below as example, the first formula is at line number 2, and end proof lines are not counted) If there is more than one person with the shortest answer the reward goes to the first poster. (measured with the last substantional edit of the proof) The answer must be in the form of a complete Fitch-style natural deduction style typed in a answer box as below.  proofs formatted in $\\LaTeX$ is even better, but I just don't know how to do that. The proofsystem is the Fitch style natural deduction system as described in \"Language proof and Logic\" by Barwise cs, ( LPL, http://ggweb.stanford.edu/lpl/ )  except that the General Conditional proof rule is not allowed. (I just don't like the rule, not sure if using this rule would shorten the proof either) Maybe I will also give an extra prize for the most beautiful answer, or the shortest proof in another style/ method of natural deduction. it depends a bit on the answers I get, others may also set and give bounties as they see fit. you may give more than one answer, answers in more than one proof method ect, but do post them as seperate answers, and be aware that only the proof that uses the fitch method described above is competing, and other participants can peek at your answers. GOOD LUCK, and may the best one win. Proof system: For participants that don't have the LPL book the only allowed inference rules are the rules I used in the proof: the $\\bot$ (falsum , contradiction) introduction and elimination rules the $\\lnot \\lnot$ elimination rules the $\\lnot $ , $\\to$ , $\\exists$  and $\\forall$ introduction rules (also see the proof below for examples of how to use them.) Also the following rules are allowable : the $\\land$ , $\\lor$ and $\\leftrightarrow$ introduction and elimination rules. the $\\to$ , $\\exists$ and $\\forall$  elimination rules the reiteration rule. (This is just to be complete, I don't think they are useful in this proof) Notice: line 1 is empty (in the Fitch software that accompanies the book line 1 is for premisses only and there are no premisses in this proof) the end subproof lines have no line number. (and they don't count in the all important the number of lines) the General Conditional proof rule is not allowed there is no $\\lnot$ elimination rule (only an double negation elimination rule) My proof: (and example on how to use the rules, and how your answer should be formatted) 1  |\n.  |----------------- \n2  | |____________  ~Ex Vy (D(x) -> D(y))    New Subproof for ~ Introduction\n3  | | |_________a                           variable for Universal Introduction\n4  | | | |________  D(b)                     New Subproof for -> Introduction\n5  | | | | |______  ~D(a)                    New Subproof for ~ Introduction \n6  | | | | | |___c                           variable for Universal Introduction\n7  | | | | | | |__  D(a)                     New Subproof for -> Introduction\n8  | | | | | | |    _|_                      5,7 _|_ introduction\n9  | | | | | | |    D(c)                     8   _|_ Elimination\n.. | | | | | | <-------------------------   end subproof\n10 | | | | | |      D(a) -> D(c)             7-9 -> Introduction\n.. | | | | | <---------------------------   end subproof\n11 | | | | |        Vy(D(a) -> D(y))         6-10 Universal Introduction\n12 | | | | |        Ex Vy (D(x) -> D(y))     11 Existentional Introduction \n13 | | | | |        _|_                      2,12 _|_ introduction\n.. | | | | <-----------------------------   end subproof\n14 | | | |          ~~D(a)                   5-13 ~ introduction\n15 | | | |          D(a)                     14 ~~ Elimination\n.. | | | <-------------------------------   end subproof   \n16 | | |            D(b) -> D(a)             4-15 -> Introduction\n.. | | <---------------------------------   end subproof   \n17 | |              Vy(D(b) -> D(y))         3-16 Universal Introduction\n18 | |              ExVy(D(x) -> D(y))       17 Existentional Introduction\n19 | |              _|_                      2,18 _|_ introduction\n.. | <-----------------------------------   end subproof\n20 |                ~~Ex Vy (D(x) -> D(y))   2-19 ~ introduction\n21 |                Ex Vy (D(x) -> D(y))     20 ~~ Elimination Allowable Question and other meta stuff I did ask on http://meta.math.stackexchange.com/questions/13855/are-small-competitions-allowed if this is an allowable question, I was not given an answer yet (28 may 2014) that such questions were not allowable, outside the scope of this forum or any other negative remark,  I did not get any comment that this was an improper question, or under which circumstances such competitions are allowed. (the most negative comment was that it should be unmarked reputation points. :) and that comment was later removed... If you disagree with this please add that as answer to the question on at the meta math stackexchange site. (or vote such an answer up) If on the other hand you do like competitions, also show your support on the meta site, ( by adding it as answer, or voting such an answer up) PS don't think all logic is all simple , I will make a shorter proof in no time, the question is rather hard and difficult, but proof that I am wrong  :)",

I do have a couple comments though. First, I highly doubt this proof can be attained by the last applied rule being Existential Generalization. This statement is a logical truth precisely because we can change our $x$ depending on whether the domain has or has not a member such that $Dx$ holds. If $D$ holds for all members of the domain, any choice of $x$ will make the statement true. If $D$ does not hold for some member of the domain, choosing that as our $x$ will make the statement true. Saying that we can reach the conclusion by one final use of E.G. means that the member $b$ which appears in the precedent somehow handled both cases while the only thing we are supposed to know about $b$ is that it is a member of the domain. We still don't know anything of the domain. With that said, after I got a copy of your book and read the rules, it appears the only way we can get to the conclusion is by an application of double negation. And the only way to get there is a proof by contradiction. Thus I believe your lines 1, 2, 19, 20, and 21 belong to the minimal solution. So far, I haven't found anything simpler for the middle.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me tackle this problem. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to parse the original question and filter out the unrelated information.\n\nThe original question is about a competition to find the shortest proof of the theorem ∃x∀y(D(x) → D(y)). The user provided a lot of details about the competition rules, proof system, and an example proof. However, the main problem is to prove that theorem in the Fitch-style natural deduction system with specific rules.\n\nThe example given in the problem shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. In the example, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is a logic problem, so I need to check if there are any assumptions given in the original question.\n\nLooking at the problem, the competition is about the shortest proof of the theorem. The problem statement itself is the theorem ∃x∀y(D(x) → D(y)). The user mentions that they managed to prove it in 21 lines and wants to know if a shorter proof exists. The assumptions here would relate to the proof system rules specified. However, the problem doesn't state any specific premises or domain restrictions except for the proof system rules (Fitch-style, certain allowed rules, no General Conditional Proof).\n\nWait, but in the example provided by the user, the assumptions were about the variables and conditions in the problem. In the drinker paradox case, maybe the assumptions are about the domain or the predicates? But the drinker paradox is a theorem in predicate logic, valid in non-empty domains. So perhaps the assumption is that the domain is non-empty? Because ∃x∀y(...) requires that there is at least some element in the domain. However, the original problem doesn't specify this explicitly, but in standard Fitch systems, the domain is usually non-empty. However, the user didn't mention that. Wait, looking at the original problem, the user's proof starts by assuming ~∃x∀y(D(x)→D(y)) and derives a contradiction. So maybe the key assumption is that the domain is non-empty, but in the problem as stated, is that an assumption?\n\nBut in the problem as presented on Math Stack Exchange, the user is asking for a proof of ∃x∀y(D(x)→D(y)) using the specified rules. The standard drinker paradox requires the domain to be non-empty. So perhaps the assumption here is that the domain is non-empty. However, the user didn't explicitly state that. Let me check the original question again. The user says \"the proof of the drinkers paradox\", which typically assumes a non-empty domain. So maybe that's an implicit assumption here.\n\nSo for the formatted problem, the assumption would be that the domain is non-empty. But how is that phrased in logical terms? Since in first-order logic, the domain is non-empty by default. However, if the system allows empty domains, then ∃x(...) would be false if the domain is empty. But in the problem, since they are proving ∃x∀y(D(x)→D(y)), if the domain is empty, this would be false. Therefore, the assumption must be that the domain is non-empty. However, the user didn't mention it, but in their proof, they introduced a variable 'a' and derived D(a), which requires the domain to have at least one element. Therefore, the domain is non-empty is an implicit assumption.\n\nTherefore, the assumption here is that the domain of discourse is non-empty. So translating that into the format:\n\nAssumption: The domain of discourse is non-empty.\n\nProblem: Prove that ∃x∀y(D(x) → D(y)).\n\nBut wait, in the example given by the user, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7. So in that problem, the assumptions were specific conditions on the variables. Here, the assumption is about the structure of the domain. But how to phrase that concisely?\n\nAlternatively, since the original problem is in predicate logic and the theorem is valid in non-empty domains, perhaps the assumption is that there exists at least one element in the domain. So:\n\nAssumption: There exists at least one element in the domain.\n\nBut in Fitch-style proofs, variables are introduced with universal instantiation, which might require the domain to be non-empty. However, the user's proof starts with a subproof assuming ~∃x∀y(...), then introduces a variable 'a', which could be any element. If the domain were empty, you couldn't introduce 'a', but since the proof does introduce variables, perhaps the system assumes a non-empty domain. So maybe the key assumption here is that the domain is non-empty. Therefore, the formatted problem would list that as an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is purely syntactic and the proof doesn't rely on the domain being non-empty, but that's not the case here. Since the drinker paradox is ∃x (D(x) → ∀y D(y)), which is equivalent to ∃x∀y (D(x) → D(y)), and this is valid only in non-empty domains. Therefore, the domain being non-empty is a necessary assumption.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should include that the domain is non-empty.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nAssumption: The domain of discourse is non-empty.\n\nProblem: Prove that ∃x∀y(D(x) → D(y)).\n\nBut the original competition question didn't mention this assumption explicitly. The user's proof might have implicitly used it by introducing variables. However, in standard Fitch systems, the domain is considered non-empty. So maybe in the context of the problem, this is an implicit assumption. Therefore, it should be listed as an assumption in the formatted problem.",
