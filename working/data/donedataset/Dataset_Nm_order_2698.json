    "Content": "Let a real positive number sequence $(x_{n})$ such that $\\left | x_{n+1}-\\frac{x_{n}^2}{x_{n-1}} \\right |\\leq 1$ and $\\sqrt{x_{1}}\\geq \\sqrt{x_0+1}$. Show that $(\\frac{x_{n+1}}{x_{n}}) $ convergent. I have tried to define a sequence $(y_{n})$ such that $y_{n}=\\frac{x_{n+1}}{x_{n}}$. So the preceding inequality equivalent to : $\\left |x_{n}( \\frac{x_{n+1}}{x_{n}}-\\frac{x_{n}}{x_{n-1}}) \\right |\\leq 1$\n$\\equiv \\left |y_{n}-y_{n-1}\\right |\\leq \\frac {1}{x_{n}}$ I want to show that $(y_{n})$ is contractive sequence, and then it will be a cauchy sequence if and only if convergent sequence. But i stuck at this part.\nPlease give me some clue, thank you.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "What about the following sequence:\n$$1,2,3,\\frac{7}{2},\\frac{37}{12},\\frac{865}{504},1,1,\\frac{1}{2},1,1,\\frac{1}{2},1,1,\\frac{1}{2},...$$ I believe it satisfies the given conditions, but clearly $\\frac{x_{n+1}}{x_n}$ doesn't converge. I think the problem statement might be wrong.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me start by reading the original question carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a sequence of positive real numbers (x_n) that satisfies two conditions: first, the absolute difference between x_{n+1} and (x_n^2)/x_{n-1} is less than or equal to 1. Second, the square root of x_1 is greater than or equal to the square root of x_0 plus 1. The goal is to show that the sequence of ratios y_n = x_{n+1}/x_n is convergent.\n\nNow, let me parse the assumptions. The user mentions that (x_n) is a sequence of positive real numbers. That's one assumption. Then, the inequality |x_{n+1} - (x_n^2)/x_{n-1}| ≤ 1 applies for each n, which is another condition. The initial condition is sqrt(x_1) ≥ sqrt(x_0 + 1). Wait, the original problem says \"sqrt(x1) ≥ sqrt(x0 +1)\", but I need to make sure I capture this correctly. Also, each assumption should be a single property applied to one object.\n\nSo breaking it down:\n\n1. The sequence (x_n) consists of positive real numbers. So each x_n > 0.\n2. For all n, |x_{n+1} - (x_n^2)/x_{n-1}| ≤ 1.\n3. The initial terms satisfy sqrt(x_1) ≥ sqrt(x_0 + 1). Hmm, maybe that's one assumption. But let me check if sqrt(x_1) is supposed to be greater than or equal to sqrt(x_0) + 1, or sqrt(x_0 +1). The original question says \"sqrt(x1) >= sqrt(x0+1)\", so it's the square root of (x_0 +1). So that's another condition on the initial terms x_0 and x_1.\n\nThe problem is to show that the sequence y_n = x_{n+1}/x_n is convergent.\n\nWait, in the example provided, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\", which was part of the problem's original statement. So in this case, the problem's original assumptions are:\n\n- (x_n) is a sequence of positive real numbers.\n\n- For all n, |x_{n+1} - (x_n^2)/x_{n-1}| ≤ 1.\n\n- sqrt(x1) >= sqrt(x0 + 1).\n\nThese are three separate assumptions. Each should be on its own line.\n\nSo the formatted problem should list each assumption line by line:\n\nAssumption:\n(xₙ) is a sequence of positive real numbers,\nFor each n, |xₙ₊₁ - (xₙ²)/xₙ₋₁| ≤ 1,\n√(x₁) ≥ √(x₀ + 1).\n\nProblem:\nShow that the sequence (yₙ) where yₙ = xₙ₊₁/xₙ is convergent.\n\nWait, but in the original problem statement, the user mentions defining y_n as x_{n+1}/x_n, but the problem is to show that (x_{n+1}/x_n) is convergent. So the problem statement is correctly captured as asking to show that (y_n) converges.\n\nI should check if there are any other implicit assumptions. For example, when dealing with sequences like x_{n}/x_{n-1}, we need to ensure that x_{n-1} is not zero, which is covered by the first assumption that all x_n are positive. So that's covered.\n\nAnother thing: the initial condition sqrt(x₁) ≥ sqrt(x₀ + 1). Let me make sure that's written correctly. The original says \"sqrt{x1} >= sqrt{x0 +1}\". So yes, that's √(x₁) ≥ √(x₀ +1), not √x₁ ≥ √x₀ + 1. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are correctly captured as three separate lines, each addressing one condition. The problem is to show convergence of the ratio sequence.",
