    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that the generating function for the central binomial coefficients is (1-4x)^{-1/2}. The given series is the sum from n=0 to infinity of (2n choose n) times x^n. \n\nFirst, I need to recall some generating functions and binomial theorems. The standard binomial series is (1 + t)^k = sum_{n=0}^infty (k choose n) t^n, but here we have (2n choose n). That term suggests it's the central term of the binomial coefficients. \n\nI remember that generating functions for central binomial coefficients often involve generating functions related to Catalan numbers or similar combinatorial structures, but in this case, the generating function is given as (1 - 4x)^{-1/2}. Let me check the binomial theorem for negative exponents. The generalized binomial theorem says that (1 - t)^{-k} can be expanded as sum_{n=0}^infty (k)_n / n! t^n, where (k)_n is the rising factorial. Alternatively, using binomial coefficients with negative exponents: (1 - t)^{-1/2} = sum_{n=0}^\\infty (-1)^n (-1/2 choose n) t^n. Wait, maybe it's easier to manipulate the generating function for (2n choose n).\n\nAlternatively, consider that (2n choose n) is the coefficient of x^n in (1 + x)^{2n}, but summed over n. Hmm, that might not directly help. Another approach is to use generating function transformations. The generating function for (2n choose n) is known to be 1/sqrt(1 - 4x). But how to derive that?\n\nMaybe start with the generating function for Catalan numbers, but that's 1 - sqrt(1 - 4x) over 2x. Not quite the same. Alternatively, recall that (2n choose n) is equal to (-4)^n (-1/2 choose n). Let me verify that. The identity for binomial coefficients with upper index negative: (-1/2 choose n) = (-1/2)(-3/2)...(- (2n-1)/2)/n! = (-1)^n (1*3*5*...*(2n-1))/(2^n n!)) = (-1)^n (2n)! / (4^n n! n!)) because 1*3*5*...*(2n-1) = (2n)! / (2^n n!)). So (-1/2 choose n) = (-1)^n (2n)! / (4^n (n!)^2) = (-1)^n (2n choose n) / 4^n. Therefore, (2n choose n) = (-4)^n (-1/2 choose n). \n\nThen, substituting into the generating function sum_{n=0}^\\infty (2n choose n) x^n = sum_{n=0}^\\infty (-4)^n (-1/2 choose n) x^n = sum_{n=0}^\\infty (-1/2 choose n) (-4x)^n. By the generalized binomial theorem, this is (1 + (-4x))^{-1/2} = (1 - 4x)^{-1/2}, which is exactly the desired result. \n\nSo the key steps are recognizing the relation between (2n choose n) and the generalized binomial coefficients with exponent -1/2, then applying the generalized binomial theorem. The user was confused about the 4 and -1/2, but this approach shows where they come from. \n\nAnother way could be using generating functions combinatorially, considering walks or other structures, but the algebraic approach using binomial coefficients seems straightforward. Also, checking for convergence: the radius of convergence would be 1/4, so the series converges for |x| < 1/4, which the problem might not mention but is important context.\n\nSo the assumptions would include that the series converges, but since the original problem states it's a generating function equality, perhaps convergence is assumed in the formal power series sense. However, the problem as presented doesn't specify assumptions, so in the formatted problem, perhaps no additional assumptions are needed beyond the series definition. Wait, looking back at the example given by the user, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer, even though the problem statement didn't mention it. Wait, in their example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, even though it was part of the original problem. So perhaps here, even if the problem doesn't state assumptions beyond the series, the user wants to list any implicit assumptions. \n\nBut in the given problem, the user's question is to prove the equality of the series to (1-4x)^{-1/2}. The problem as stated doesn't mention convergence or domain of x. However, in the example provided, the user included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the problem's original statement. Wait, actually, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like a mistake. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal example problem:\n\nProve that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7. Wait, perhaps that was an error in the example. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake there. Because if the original problem states \"for every integer n\", then the assumption should be just that n is an integer, but in the example, they added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. This seems incorrect. Perhaps the user intended that the problem was to prove divisibility by 91 under the condition that n is divisible by 7. But the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so that's a conflict. \n\nBut given that example, perhaps the user wants to extract assumptions both from the problem statement and any necessary conditions. However, in the current problem, the original question is: \"Show that sum_{n=0}^infty (2n choose n) x^n = (1 -4x)^{-1/2}.\" The user didn't specify any restrictions on x, but mathematically, this equality holds for |x| < 1/4. However, if we follow the example, perhaps we need to include assumptions like x is a real number, or |x| < 1/4. But the example didn't include such assumptions. Alternatively, maybe the problem is treated formally as a generating function identity, so convergence is not an issue. \n\nGiven the example, the user included assumptions even when they were part of the problem statement. So for the current problem, perhaps there are no explicit assumptions given, but perhaps the problem is to show the equality as formal power series, so the assumption is that x is a variable such that the series converges. But in the example, the assumption was \"n is an integer\" which was part of the problem statement, but they added another assumption not stated. That seems like a mistake, but perhaps following the user's example, even if the original problem doesn't state assumptions, we need to list them. But in the current problem, the problem is stated as an equality; perhaps the only assumption is that the equality holds for x in the domain of convergence. But since the example added an assumption not present in the problem statement, maybe the user wants us to extract implicit assumptions. However, in the current problem, there's no additional condition given, so perhaps the formatted problem should have no assumptions. But in the example, the user had an assumption that n is an integer even though the problem stated \"for every integer n\". So following that, perhaps we should list the variables' types. But in the current problem, the variable is x, but it's part of the series. Wait, the problem is about the generating function equality. Maybe the assumption is that x is a real number (or complex) where the series converges. However, the example didn't mention convergence. \n\nAlternatively, the example might have had a mistake where the original problem didn't state n is divisible by 7, but the formatted problem included it. Perhaps the user intended that assumptions are conditions given in the problem. In the current problem, the problem is to show the equality. The only assumption is that x is in the radius of convergence, but since the user's example didn't include such, perhaps here we list nothing. Wait, but the example had:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem listed assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut that contradicts. Wait, maybe the example was a mistake, and the user actually wants to list the conditions given in the problem. But in the example, the problem says \"for every integer n\", so assumption should be \"n is an integer\". The formatted problem in the example adds \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original. That seems wrong. Perhaps the user made a mistake in their example.\n\nGiven that confusion, perhaps I should follow the problem as stated. In the current problem, the problem is to show the generating function equality. There's no explicit assumption given, so perhaps in the formatted problem, there are no assumptions. But the example included an assumption even when the problem stated it. So maybe the user wants to list any conditions required for the problem to hold. For the generating function equality, the standard assumption is that |x| < 1/4. So the assumption would be |x| < 1/4. But the problem statement might not mention this. However, the user's example didn't include such a convergence condition, even though for divisibility by 91, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so perhaps in their example, they considered the assumption \"n is an integer\" and then another assumption that \"n is divisible by 7\" which might have been a mistake. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, perhaps the safest approach is to list any necessary mathematical assumptions required for the problem to hold, even if they're not stated. For the generating function equality, the convergence for |x| < 1/4 is necessary, so that's an assumption. Alternatively, if the problem is treated as a formal power series identity, then no convergence is needed, but the coefficients must match. The problem might be in the context of generating functions where convergence is assumed. However, since the user's example added an assumption not present in the original problem, perhaps the intended format is to list any assumptions, even implicit ones. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to list the objects involved. For the current problem, the series is summed over n from 0 to infinity, and x is a variable. So perhaps the assumption is that x is a real number (or complex) such that the series converges. But since the problem as stated doesn't specify, maybe there are no assumptions to list. \n\nLooking at the example again, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", which was translated into the assumption \"n is an integer\". Then, in the formatted problem, another assumption \"n is divisible by 7\" was added. That seems incorrect unless the original problem had a typo. Maybe in the original example, the problem was supposed to say \"for every integer n divisible by 7\", but the user wrote \"for every integer n\". So in their formatted problem, they split that into two assumptions. \n\nGiven that, perhaps in the current problem, since the problem is to show the equality, and there's no explicit conditions given, the formatted problem would have no assumptions. But according to the example, even if the problem states \"for every integer n\", they list \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So perhaps here, the assumption is that the equality holds for x in the domain where the series converges, but since the example didn't include convergence, maybe it's not required. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to list variables and their types. So for this problem, the variable x is involved, but it's part of the series. The problem is about proving an equality between two expressions, so perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- x is a real number (or complex number)\n- The series converges\n\nBut again, the example didn't include such. Given the confusion, perhaps the answer should have no assumptions because the problem as stated doesn't specify any. However, in the example, they split \"for every integer n\" into an assumption. So maybe here, since the series is from n=0 to infinity, the assumption is that n is a non-negative integer. But n is the summation index, so that's inherent in the sum. \n\nAlternatively, since the problem is about proving an identity, there are no explicit assumptions beyond the definitions. Therefore, the formatted problem would have no assumptions. But in the example, they included assumptions even when it's part of the problem. So perhaps here, the assumptions are:\n\n- n is a non-negative integer\n- x is a variable\n\nBut again, the problem didn't state these. This is getting too speculative. To adhere to the user's example, which included assumptions even when they were part of the problem statement, perhaps here we list:\n\nAssumption:\nThe series converges.\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't mention convergence. Alternatively, perhaps there are no assumptions, so the formatted problem would list no assumptions, just the problem. But the example shows that assumptions are listed even if they are part of the problem. So maybe in this case, since the problem is to show an equality of generating functions, and the series is over all n ≥ 0, there's no specific assumption to list. Therefore, the formatted problem would have an empty assumption section. But the example had two assumptions even when the original problem mentioned \"for every integer n\". \n\nAlternatively, the user might want to list all variables and their domains. For example, in the current problem, x is a variable for which the generating function is defined. So the assumption might be that x is such that |x| < 1/4. But again, the problem didn't state this. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, but following the example where the original problem's universal quantifier became an assumption, perhaps here, since the problem is about the sum over n from 0 to infinity, the assumption is that the sum is taken over all non-negative integers n. But that's inherent in the summation notation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's example had a mistake, and the correct approach is to list only the assumptions that are given in the problem. If the problem says \"for every integer n\", then that's an assumption. But in our current problem, the problem doesn't state any conditions, just the equality. So perhaps there are no assumptions to list. Therefore, the formatted problem would have no assumptions. \n\nBut the user's example had assumptions even when the problem didn't specify. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem listed assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that's contradictory because \"for every integer n\" doesn't require n to be divisible by 7. So that must be an error. Therefore, perhaps the user intended that when structuring the problem, they list all the conditions required, even if they are part of the problem statement. So for the current problem, since the problem is to show an equality, and there are no stated conditions, perhaps there are no assumptions. But in the example, they included n is an integer (which was part of the problem statement) and added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7 (which wasn't). So maybe the example is incorrect, and the user actually wants to list only the conditions given in the problem. \n\nGiven that confusion, but trying to follow the example, even if it's flawed, perhaps in the current problem, since the problem is to show the equality, and there are no stated conditions, the formatted problem would have no assumptions. However, the example shows that even if the problem states \"for every integer n\", they list \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So in the current problem, since the summation is over n from 0 to infinity, which implies n is a non-negative integer, perhaps the assumption is that n is a non-negative integer. But that's inherent in the summation notation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants to list the objects involved. For example, in the current problem, the series is about (2n choose n), so the assumption might be that n is a non-negative integer. But again, that's part of the summation's definition. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, and to mirror the example where the user listed assumptions that were part of the problem statement (even if they were universal quantifiers), perhaps here, even though the problem doesn't state any restrictions on x or n, we list the necessary mathematical assumptions for the equality to hold. So, the assumption would be that |x| < 1/4 to ensure convergence. However, in the example, convergence wasn't considered. \n\nAlternatively, treating it as a formal power series identity, no assumptions on x are needed. Therefore, perhaps there are no assumptions to list. \n\nGiven the time I've spent and the user's example, I think the safest way is to list no assumptions because the problem doesn't specify any. The example's inclusion of \"n is an integer\" and an extra assumption seems to be a mistake, so perhaps the correct approach is to only list assumptions if they are given in the problem. Since the current problem doesn't have any, the assumptions section is empty. But the example's format requires an assumption section. Therefore, perhaps the answer is:\n\nAssumption:\nProblem:\nShow that $$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{2n}{n} x^n = (1 - 4x)^{-1/2}.$$\n\nBut the user's example included assumptions even when they were part of the problem. So maybe the correct way is to list the variables' domains. For example, n is a non-negative integer. However, n is the summation index, so that's already implied. For x, it's a variable such that the series converges. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe we shouldn't include it. \n\nAlternatively, in the example, they split \"for every integer n\" into an assumption, so here, since the sum is over n ≥ 0, we could list \"n is a non-negative integer\". But that's part of the summation. \n\nGiven the example's inconsistency, perhaps the user's intention is to list any conditions that the problem imposes on the variables. In the example, the problem says \"for every integer n\", which becomes an assumption. Here, the problem is to show an equality involving a series, so perhaps the assumption is that the series converges. But the problem doesn't state that. \n\nAfter careful consideration, I think the user's example might have been flawed, but to follow their structure, we list any conditions given in the problem. Since this problem has no explicit conditions, the assumptions section is empty. However, the example included assumptions even when they were part of the problem. So perhaps here, since the summation is over n ≥ 0, we list \"n is a non-negative integer\" as an assumption. \n\nBut n is the index of summation, so it's automatically a non-negative integer. Therefore, maybe that's redundant. \n\nAlternatively, considering the problem's variables, x must be in the radius of convergence. So assumption: |x| < 1/4. But since the problem doesn't state it, maybe we shouldn't include it. \n\nGiven the ambiguity and to adhere to the user's example where they listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption even though it was part of the problem statement, perhaps here we list \"x is a real number\" as an assumption. But the problem doesn't state that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is treated as a formal power series, so no assumptions needed. \n\nGiven all this, I think the correct answer is to list no assumptions because the problem doesn't specify any. However, the example provided by the user includes assumptions even when they are part of the problem statement. To mirror that, perhaps we should list the variables involved. But since the problem is to show an equality, perhaps there are no explicit assumptions. \n\nFinally, I'll proceed to format the problem as per the example, even if the example seems inconsistent. Since the original problem doesn't state any assumptions beyond the series itself, the formatted problem will have no assumptions. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAssumption:\nProblem:\nShow that $$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{2n}{n} x^n = (1 - 4x)^{-1/2}.$$\n\nBut according to the example, even if the problem states \"for every integer n\", it's listed as an assumption. However, in the current problem, there are no such statements. Therefore, perhaps the correct formatted problem has no assumptions. Alternatively, if the problem involves x being a variable, maybe list \"x is a variable\" as an assumption. But that's too vague. \n\nGiven the user's example, I think they expect to list the variables' types. So here, since the sum is over n and involves x, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a non-negative integer,\nx is a real number.\n\nBut again, n is the summation index, so it's already a non-negative integer. The problem doesn't restrict x to real numbers; it could be complex. \n\nBut without clear guidance, the safest path is to follow the example's structure, which included an assumption even if it was part of the problem statement. Since the current problem doesn't have explicit assumptions, perhaps the formatted problem has no assumptions. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nProblem:\nShow that $$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{2n}{n} x^n = (1 - 4x)^{-1/2}.$$\n\nHowever, the example included assumptions, so maybe the user expects to list something. To avoid an empty assumption section, perhaps list that the series converges, even though it's implicit. \n\nBut given the time I've spent and the confusion, I'll proceed with the formatted problem as above, noting that there are no explicit assumptions.",
