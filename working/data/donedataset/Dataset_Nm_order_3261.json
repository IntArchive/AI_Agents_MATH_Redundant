    "AcceptedAnswer": "Suppose that no $a_i$ divides $F(n)$ for every $n$. For each $a_i$, there is a power of prime factor of $a_i$ that does not divide $F(n)$ for every $n$. This forms a set of prime powers from which we can extract the minimum elements with respect to divisibility: $p_1^{e_1},\\dots,p_m^{e_m}$, with $p_1,\\dots,p_m$ distinct primes. Call $q_j$ any number such that $p_j^{e_j} \\nmid F(q_j)$. By the Chinese remainder theorem, there is some $n_0$ such that for every $j$:\n$$n_0\\equiv q_j \\pmod{p_j^{e_j}}$$ Therefore:\n$$F(n_0)\\equiv F(q_j)\\pmod {p_j^{e_j}}$$\nso by definition of $q_j$, $p_j^{e_j} \\nmid F(n_0)$. As a consequence no $a_i$ can divide $F(n_0)$: this contradicts the hypothesis. So there must be some $a_i$ that divides $F(n)$ for every $n$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about a polynomial F(x) with integer coefficients. The given condition is that for every positive integer n, F(n) is divisible by at least one of the integers a1, a2, ..., ak. We need to prove that there exists a specific ai among these such that for every positive integer n, F(n) is divisible by ai.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the question correctly. The user wants to structure the problem into Assumptions and Problem parts. The example given shows that assumptions list each condition applied to one object. So I need to extract all the individual assumptions from the problem statement.\n\nLet's break down the original problem:\n\n1. F(x) is in ℤ[x], which means F is a polynomial with integer coefficients. That's an assumption about F.\n2. For all positive integers n, F(n) is divisible by one of a1, a2, ..., ak, where each ai is an integer. So another assumption is that the set {a1, ..., ak} is given, each ai is in ℤ.\n3. The conclusion to prove is that there exists a particular ai in the set such that every F(n) is divisible by this ai.\n\nWait, but the problem statement might not explicitly state some conditions. For example, the original problem mentions \"for any positive integer n\", so the assumption is about all positive integers n. Also, the ai are integers, but do they need to be positive or non-zero? The problem doesn't specify, so I should stick to what's given.\n\nLooking at the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and n being divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions should be:\n\n- F is a polynomial with integer coefficients (since F ∈ ℤ[x]).\n- For every positive integer n, F(n) is divisible by at least one element of {a1, a2, ..., ak}.\n- Each ai is an integer (from the problem statement).\n\nWait, but the problem says \"a1, a2, ..., ak ∈ ℤ\". So that's another assumption.\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n1. F(x) is in ℤ[x] (so F has integer coefficients).\n2. Each ai is an integer (from \"a1, a2, ..., ak ∈ ℤ\").\n3. For every positive integer n, F(n) is divisible by at least one of a1, a2, ..., ak.\n\nThe problem is to prove that there exists an ai in the set such that for all positive integers n, F(n) is divisible by ai.\n\nBut wait, in the original problem, the user might have missed some conditions. For example, if the ai are allowed to be zero, then divisibility by zero is undefined. So maybe we need to assume each ai is a non-zero integer? But the problem as stated says \"divisible by a_i\", which in mathematics usually requires a_i ≠ 0. However, the problem statement doesn't specify this. But perhaps in the context, the ai are positive integers or non-zero. But since the original problem didn't state that, I shouldn't add assumptions unless necessary.\n\nWait, the original problem on Math Stack Exchange says \"Prove that there exists a_i ∈ {a1,...,a_k} so that for any positive integer n F(n) is divisible by a_i\". So the user hasn't specified that the ai are non-zero. But divisibility by zero is undefined, so maybe that's a hidden assumption. However, since the problem is from Math Stack Exchange, maybe the original context assumes that the ai are non-zero. But since the user hasn't included that in their problem statement, I need to be cautious.\n\nBut according to the problem as presented here, the user wrote: \"For all positive integer n , F(n) is divisible by one of a_1 , a_2 , \\dots , a_k ∈ ℤ\". So the ai are integers, but divisibility by zero is undefined. So perhaps there's an implicit assumption that ai are non-zero integers. However, since the problem didn't specify, maybe we should list that each ai is a non-zero integer? Or is that inferred?\n\nHmm. In standard divisibility, divisors must be non-zero. So the problem must assume that each ai is a non-zero integer. But since the original problem didn't state that, perhaps the user expects that the assistant includes that as an assumption. Alternatively, maybe the problem is stated correctly, and we just proceed with the given information.\n\nWait, in the example provided, the original problem said \"divisible by 91\", which is a positive integer, so maybe in the given problem, the ai are positive integers. But the user wrote \"a1, a2, ..., ak ∈ ℤ\". But in the context of divisibility, negative integers can also be divisors, but typically we consider positive ones. However, the problem might allow ai to be any non-zero integers. But since the problem says \"divisible by a_i\", which in mathematics, a_i must be non-zero. So perhaps the problem implicitly assumes that each a_i is a non-zero integer. Therefore, the assumptions should include that each a_i is a non-zero integer.\n\nBut the original problem says \"a1, a2, ..., ak ∈ ℤ\". So they are integers, but possibly zero. However, since they are used as divisors, they must be non-zero. Therefore, maybe the problem has a typo, or the user intended them to be non-zero. Since the problem is about divisibility, I think it's safe to include that each a_i is a non-zero integer as an assumption. But since the original problem didn't state that, I'm not sure if I should add it. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the ai are positive integers. But the user wrote \"a1, ..., a_k ∈ ℤ\", so they can be any integers.\n\nBut in the example, the problem didn't mention that 91 is positive, but it's a given. So maybe in the current problem, the ai are non-zero integers. Therefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n- F(x) is a polynomial with integer coefficients.\n- Each ai is a non-zero integer.\n- For every positive integer n, F(n) is divisible by at least one of a1, a2, ..., ak.\n\nBut wait, how do I know the user intended ai to be non-zero? The problem says \"divisible by a_i\", so mathematically, a_i must be non-zero. Therefore, even if the user wrote \"a_i ∈ ℤ\", we have to include that a_i ≠ 0. So that's an implicit assumption.\n\nBut the original problem in the user's example had \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\", which is a positive integer, but in the formatted problem, the assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". So maybe in the current problem, the key assumptions are:\n\n1. F(x) ∈ ℤ[x].\n2. Each a_i ∈ ℤ (but since divisibility requires a_i ≠ 0, this is implied).\n3. For all positive integers n, F(n) is divisible by at least one a_i.\n\nBut perhaps the problem doesn't explicitly state that the a_i are non-zero, so maybe the user didn't consider that. However, in mathematical terms, divisibility by zero is undefined, so the problem must assume a_i ≠ 0. Therefore, in the assumptions, I should list that each a_i is a non-zero integer. But since the original problem didn't specify, perhaps I should just stick to what's written.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"a1, a2, ..., a_k ∈ ℤ\". So they are integers. But if one of them is zero, then F(n) must be divisible by zero, which is impossible unless F(n) is zero for all n, but F is a polynomial, so it's identically zero. But the problem says \"for any positive integer n, F(n) is divisible by one of the a_i\". If one of the a_i is zero, then F(n) must be zero for all n, which implies F is the zero polynomial. But the problem doesn't state that F is non-zero, so perhaps if F is the zero polynomial, then all a_i can be zero, but that's a trivial case. However, in the problem statement, the conclusion is to prove that there exists an a_i such that for all n, F(n) is divisible by a_i. If a_i is zero, then F(n) must be zero for all n. But this is only possible if F is the zero polynomial. So unless F is the zero polynomial, the a_i cannot include zero. Therefore, to avoid trivialities, the problem probably assumes that a_i are non-zero integers, and F is a non-zero polynomial. However, since the problem doesn't state this, maybe I should not include it as an assumption. But perhaps the user expects that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem as stated allows some a_i to be zero, but in that case, the conclusion would be that either F is identically zero (so all a_i can be zero), or there exists a non-zero a_i that divides all F(n). But I think the intended problem is to assume that the a_i are fixed integers (non-zero) and F is a non-zero polynomial.\n\nBut since the user hasn't specified, I should stick to the given information. Therefore, the assumptions as per the problem statement are:\n\n1. F(x) is a polynomial with integer coefficients (F ∈ ℤ[x]).\n2. The set {a1, a2, ..., ak} consists of integers (each a_i ∈ ℤ).\n3. For every positive integer n, F(n) is divisible by at least one element of {a1, a2, ..., ak}.\n\nThe problem is to prove that there exists a specific a_i in the set such that for every positive integer n, F(n) is divisible by a_i.\n\nTherefore, structuring this:\n\nAssumption:\n- F(x) is an element of ℤ[x],\n- Each a_i is an integer,\n- For every positive integer n, F(n) is divisible by at least one of a1, a2, ..., ak.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a_i ∈ {a1, ..., ak} such that for every positive integer n, F(n) is divisible by a_i.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the assumptions were split into separate lines. So each assumption is on its own line. For example:\n\nAssumption:\n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by 7.\n\nSo here, each bullet point is one assumption. Therefore, in this problem:\n\nAssumption:\nF(x) is a polynomial with integer coefficients,\nEach a_i is an integer,\nFor every positive integer n, F(n) is divisible by at least one of a1, a2, ..., ak.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a_i ∈ {a1, ..., ak} such that for every positive integer n, F(n) is divisible by a_i.\n\nBut in the original problem statement, the user might have written \"a1, a2, ..., a_k ∈ ℤ\", which is one assumption. Then the other assumption is about F(n) being divisible by one of the ai for every n. The third assumption is F ∈ ℤ[x].\n\nSo each of these is a separate assumption. Therefore, the formatted problem should have three assumptions:\n\n1. F(x) ∈ ℤ[x]\n2. Each a_i ∈ ℤ\n3. For every positive integer n, F(n) is divisible by at least one a_i\n\nThen the problem is to show there exists an a_i such that for all n, F(n) divisible by a_i.\n\nYes, that seems right. The key is that the assumptions are split into individual conditions, each applied to one object. So here, each assumption is a separate condition: F's coefficients are integers, each a_i is an integer, and the divisibility condition for all n.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem should be as above.",
