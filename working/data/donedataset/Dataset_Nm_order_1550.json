    "Content": "Let $V$ be a $\\mathbb{R}$-vector space.\nLet $\\Phi:V^n\\to\\mathbb{R}$ a multilinear symmetric operator. Is it true and how do we show that for any $v_1,\\ldots,v_n\\in V$, we have: $$\\Phi[v_1,\\ldots,v_n]=\\frac{1}{n!} \\sum_{k=1}^n \\sum_{1\\leq j_1<\\cdots<j_k\\leq n} (-1)^{n-k}\\phi (v_{j_1}+\\cdots+v_{j_k}),$$\nwhere $\\phi(v)=\\Phi(v,\\ldots,v)$. My question come from that, I have seen this formula when I was reading about mixed volume, and also when I was reading about mixed Monge-Ampère measure. The setting was not exactly the one of a vector space $V$ but I think the formula is true here and I am interested by having this property shown out of the specific context of Monge-Ampère measures or volumes. I have done some work in the other direction, i.e. starting from an operator $\\phi:V\\to\\mathbb{R}$ satisfying some condition and obtaining a multilinear operator $\\Phi$ ; bellow are the results I have seen in this direction. I already know that if $\\phi':V\\to\\mathbb{R}$ is such that for any $v_1,\\ldots,v_n\\in V$, $\\phi'(\\lambda_1 v_1+\\ldots+\\lambda_n v_n)$ is a homogeneous polynomial of degree $n$ in the variables $\\lambda_i$, then there exists a unique multilinear symmetric operator $\\Phi':V^n\\to\\mathbb{R}$ such that $\\Phi'(v,\\ldots,v)=\\phi'(v)$ for any $v\\in V$. Moreover $\\Phi'(v_1,\\ldots,v_n)$ is the coefficient of the symmetric monomial $\\lambda_1\\cdots\\lambda_n$ in $\\phi'(\\lambda_1 v_1+\\ldots+\\lambda_n v_n)$ (see Symmetric multilinear form from an homogenous form. ). I also know that if $\\phi'(\\lambda v)=\\lambda^n \\phi'(v)$ and we define\n$$\\Phi''(v_1,\\ldots,v_n)=\\frac{1}{n!} \\sum_{k=1}^n \\sum_{1\\leq j_1<\\cdots<j_k\\leq n} (-1)^{n-k}\\phi' (v_{j_1}+\\cdots+v_{j_k}),$$\nthen $\\Phi''(v,\\ldots,v)=\\frac{1}{n!} \\sum_{k=1}^n (-1)^{n-k} \\binom{n}{k} k^n \\phi'(v)=\\phi'(v)$ (see Show this equality (The factorial as an alternate sum with binomial coefficients). ). It is clear that $\\Phi''$ is symmetric, but I don't know if $\\Phi''$ is multilinear. Formula for $n=2$:\n$$\\Phi[v_1,v_2]=\\frac12 [\\phi(v_1+v_2)-\\phi(v_1)-\\phi(v_2)].$$ Formula for $n=3$:\n$$\\Phi[v_1,v_2,v_3]=\\frac16 [\\phi(v_1+v_2+v_3)-\\phi(v_1+v_2)-\\phi(v_1+v_3)-\\phi(v_2+v_3)+\\phi(v_1)+\\phi(v_2)+\\phi(v_3)].$$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "(This is just the summary of the answers by Ewan and Anthony, but a lot simpler.) Let $S_n$ denote the symmetric group. Also, let us write $X=\\{1,\\dots,n\\}$ .

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original question is about proving a polarization formula for a multilinear symmetric operator on a vector space. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that V is a real vector space, and Φ is a multilinear symmetric operator from V^n to R. The task is to show that Φ can be expressed using the given formula involving sums over subsets of vectors and alternating signs. \n\nThe assumptions should list each condition applied to a single object. So, V being an R-vector space is one assumption. Φ being a multilinear operator is another, and Φ being symmetric is a third. These are separate properties, so each gets its own line. \n\nThe problem statement then is to prove the specific formula for Φ[v1,...,vn] using the sum over k and subsets. The user also mentions examples for n=2 and n=3, which might be helpful in understanding the structure but aren't part of the assumptions.\n\nI need to ensure that all assumptions are captured without including extra information. The user's own work and references to other results (like the homogeneous polynomial part) are context but not direct assumptions of the problem. So they should be excluded from the formatted problem.\n\nSo, the key assumptions are:\n- V is a real vector space.\n- Φ is a multilinear operator from V^n to R.\n- Φ is symmetric.\n\nThe problem is to show the given formula for Φ in terms of φ (which is Φ evaluated at the diagonal, i.e., φ(v) = Φ(v,...,v)).\n\nI should check if there are any other implicit assumptions. For instance, φ is defined as the diagonalization of Φ, which is given, so that's part of the problem setup. But the problem statement doesn't impose additional conditions beyond Φ being symmetric and multilinear.\n\nThus, the formatted problem should list those three assumptions and then state the problem as proving the polarization formula.",
