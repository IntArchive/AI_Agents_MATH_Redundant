    "Content": "so I was learning some abstract algebra and group theory, when they went over the proof of the cancellation law $$\nab = ac\\implies a^{-1}(ab) = a^{-1}(ac)\\implies (a^{-1}a)b = (a^{-1}a)c\\implies eb=ec \\implies b=c\n$$ But the first step in which you add the additional term seems jarring to me, especially since I felt we were proving ever trivial thing from the ground up. Obviously I'm familiar with middle school pre-algebra, so I know that it is true that if we perform an operation on both sides it preserves equality, but I didn't know how we know this is the case always. Is it an axiom or is it proven? Here is my attempt at a proof, let me know if I am going in the correct direction. Assume via axiom that $x=x$ and if $a=b$ and $b=c$ then $a=c$, and prove that $a=b\\implies ka=kb$ We know that $a=b$, we define $x\\mid x=a \\implies a=x$. Since $a=b$ and $a=x$, then $b=x$ which we can rewrite as $x=x$. Now we perform the operation on both sides $kx=kx$, which is true via our axiom. Then we re-substitute $x=a$ and $x=b$ to get $ka=kb$. Q.E.D That was my original idea but I don't know if that's watertight. Thank you!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "In first-order logic, we have the formal substitution principle : Let $\\phi$ be a propositional formula with a free variable $v$, and let $\\Gamma$ be a context.  Also, let $x, y$ be two terms representing values.  Then:\n  \\begin{align*} \\Gamma & \\vdash x = y \\\\\n\\Gamma & \\vdash \\phi[v := x] \\\\\n\\hline\n\\Gamma & \\vdash \\phi[v := y]. \\end{align*} Informally, what this says is: if you can prove in some context that $x=y$, and you can also prove some statement is true for $x$, then you can conclude the same statement is true for $y$.  (The notation $\\phi[v := x]$ just means the result of substituting $x$ in for $v$ in the proposition formula $\\phi$.) Now, if we are working in a group, let us apply this to the formula $\\phi := (a^{-1} (ab) = a^{-1} v)$.  Then in the context of the proof, we are assuming $ab = ac$.  Also, $\\phi[v := ab]$ results in the proposition $a^{-1}(ab) = a^{-1}(ab)$, which is true by the first-order axiom (or in some formulations, the formal proof rule) of reflexivity of equality : $t = t$ for any term $t$.  Therefore, the substitution principle allows us to conclude that $\\phi[v := ac]$ is true, which results in $a^{-1} (ab) = a^{-1} (ac)$. To give another application which is implicitly used in the proof, let us see how to use the substitution principle to prove the transitivity of equality: if we have $x=y$ and $y=z$ then $x=z$.  For this proof, we will use $\\phi := (x = v)$.  Then we are assuming $y=z$.  We also have that $\\phi[v := y]$ is true since it reduces to the assumption $x = y$.  Therefore, we can conclude $\\phi[v := z]$ which is just $x = z$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether performing an operation on both sides of an equation preserves equality, and if this is an axiom or something that can be proven. They mentioned the cancellation law in group theory as an example, where you multiply both sides by the inverse element. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the basic properties of equality. In mathematics, equality is typically considered an equivalence relation, which means it satisfies reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity. But beyond that, there's also the substitution property: if a = b, then any statement involving a holds true if a is replaced by b. \n\nThe user's attempt at a proof starts by assuming the standard axioms of equality: reflexivity (x = x) and transitivity (if a = b and b = c, then a = c). They then try to prove that if a = b, then ka = kb by using substitution. Their approach involves defining x as equal to a, then substituting b for x because a = b, leading to the conclusion that ka = kb. \n\nBut wait, in group theory, the cancellation law is proven using the group axioms: closure, associativity, identity element, and inverses. The step where you multiply both sides by a⁻¹ is valid because in a group, every element has an inverse, and the operation is associative. So the key here is that the operation (multiplication by a⁻¹) is a function, and applying a function to equal elements should yield equal results. \n\nThis makes me think that the preservation of equality under operations is tied to the definition of a function. If you have a function f and two equal inputs a = b, then f(a) = f(b). So maybe this is an inherent property of functions? But then, how is this established in the foundational axioms?\n\nIn first-order logic, the substitution property is often taken as an axiom schema: if x = y, then for any formula φ, φ(x) implies φ(y). However, in the context of algebraic structures like groups, the operations are required to be well-defined functions, which inherently respect equality. So when you apply a group operation (like multiplication by a⁻¹) to both sides, you're using the fact that the operation is a function, which by definition preserves equality.\n\nThe user's proof seems to be trying to use substitution in a different way. Let me check their steps again. They start with a = b, define x = a, then since a = b, substitute x = b. Then they perform the operation kx on both sides, leading to kx = kx, which is true by reflexivity. Then substituting back, they get ka = kb. \n\nIs this valid? Well, substitution is a fundamental property of equality. If x = a, then any occurrence of x can be replaced with a. But in this case, after defining x = a, and knowing a = b, they substitute x = b. Then when they apply kx to both sides, they get kx = kx, which is trivially true. Then replacing x with a and x with b, they get ka = kb. But here, the substitution might be conflating different instances. Let me think: If x is defined as a, then x is a. Since a = b, then x is also b. So kx would be ka, which is equal to kb because x is both a and b. So maybe that works, but it feels a bit circular because they're relying on the substitution property itself, which is exactly what they're trying to justify. \n\nSo perhaps the user's approach is using substitution to prove a case of substitution, which might not be rigorous. Instead, in formal logic, the substitution property is usually taken as an axiom. Therefore, the act of applying a function to both sides of an equation is valid because functions are defined to map equal inputs to equal outputs. This would mean that in group theory, when you multiply both sides by a⁻¹, you're using the fact that the group operation is a function, hence preserves equality. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be that the preservation of equality under operations is part of the substitution property of equality, which is either taken as an axiom or derived from the definition of functions. In the context of group theory, the cancellation law's proof relies on the group axioms, which include the existence of inverses and the associativity, but the step of multiplying both sides by a⁻¹ is justified by the substitution property inherent in functions (since the group operation is a function). \n\nSo, the user's attempt touches on substitution, but it might not be the most rigorous way. Instead, the key idea is that functions preserve equality, so applying a function to both sides maintains equality. In foundational terms, this is either an axiom or built into the definition of functions.",
