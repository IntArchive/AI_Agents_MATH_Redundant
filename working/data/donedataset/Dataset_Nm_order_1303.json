    "Content": "I have this formula which seems to work for the product of the first n odd numbers (I have tested it for all numbers from $1$ to $100$): $$\\prod_{i = 1}^{n} (2i - 1) =  \\frac{(2n)!}{2^{n} n!}$$ How can I prove that it holds (or find a counter-example)?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The idea is to \"complete the factorials\": $$ 1\\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdots (2n-1) = \\frac{ 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdots (2n-1)\\cdot (2n) }{2\\cdot 4 \\cdot 6 \\cdots (2n)} $$ Now take out the factor of $2$ from each term in the denominator: $$ = \\frac{ (2n)! }{2^n \\left( 1\\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdots n \\right)} = \\frac{(2n)!}{2^n n!}$$ A mathematician may object that there is a small gray area about what exactly happens between those ellipses, so for a completely rigorous proof one would take my post and incorporate it into a proof by induction.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that the product of the first n odd numbers is equal to (2n)! divided by (2^n n!). Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the product of the first n odd numbers. Let's see, the first few odd numbers are 1, 3, 5, 7, etc. So for n=1, it's 1; for n=2, 1*3=3; n=3, 1*3*5=15; n=4, 1*3*5*7=105. Then the formula claims that this product is (2n)!/(2^n n!). Let me check with n=1: (2*1)! = 2! = 2, divided by (2^1 *1!) = 2*1=2. So 2/2=1, which matches. For n=2: (4)! =24, divided by 2^2*2!=4*2=8. 24/8=3, which matches. For n=3: 6! =720, divided by 8*6=48. 720/48=15, correct. So the formula works for these cases.\n\nNow, how to prove it in general. Let's think about the product of the first n odd numbers. Each term is 2i-1 for i from 1 to n. So that's 1*3*5*...*(2n-1). Maybe I can relate this to factorials. Let's recall that (2n)! is the product of all numbers from 1 to 2n. But how does that connect to the product of only the odd numbers?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express the product of odds in terms of factorials. Let's note that the product of even numbers up to 2n is 2^n *n! because each even number is 2 times an integer from 1 to n. So 2*4*6*...*2n = 2^n (1*2*3*...*n) = 2^n n!.\n\nBut the product of all numbers from 1 to 2n is (2n)! = product of odds * product of evens. So (2n)! = [product of odds] * [2^n n!]. Therefore, solving for product of odds: product of odds = (2n)! / (2^n n!). Exactly the formula given. Therefore, the proof follows by considering that the factorial of 2n is the product of all even and odd numbers up to 2n, and the even product is 2^n n!.\n\nSo the key steps are:\n\n1. Recognize that (2n)! = product of all integers from 1 to 2n.\n2. Separate this product into even and odd numbers.\n3. The product of even numbers from 2 to 2n is 2^n * n!.\n4. Therefore, the product of odd numbers is (2n)! divided by the product of even numbers, which is 2^n n!.\n\nTherefore, the formula holds. No counter-example exists since the derivation is general.",
