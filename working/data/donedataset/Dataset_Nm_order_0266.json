    "Content": "How do you prove the following: Pythagorean trigonometric identity. For all $\\theta\\in[0,2\\pi]$ it holds that $$ \\sin^2\\theta+\\cos^2\\theta=1.$$ I'm curious to know of the different ways of proving this depending on different characterizations of sine and cosine.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $(\\mathscr C)$ be a unit circle, and $\\mathrm M\\in(\\mathscr C)$. Also, we will denote $\\rm \\angle{IOM}$ as $\\theta$ (see the diagram). From the unit circle definition, the coordinates of the point $\\rm M$ are $(\\cos\\theta,\\sin\\theta)$. And so,  $\\rm \\overline{OC}$ is $\\cos \\theta$ and $\\rm \\overline{OS}$ is $\\sin \\theta$. Therefore, $\\rm OM=\\sqrt{\\overline{OC}^2+\\overline{OS}^2}=\\sqrt{\\cos^2\\theta+\\sin^2\\theta}$. Since $\\rm M$ lies in the unit circle, $\\rm OM$ is the radius of that circle, and by definition , this radius is equal to $1$. It immediately follows that: $$\\color{grey}{\\boxed{\\,\\displaystyle\\color{black}{\\cos^2\\theta+\\sin^2\\theta=1}}}$$ $\\phantom{X}$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual mathematics professor and structure the given problem according to the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should list each condition applied to one object, and then the problem statement follows.\n\nThe original problem here is to prove the Pythagorean trigonometric identity: sin²θ + cos²θ = 1 for all θ in [0, 2π]. The question mentions different ways to prove this based on different characterizations of sine and cosine.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states \"for all θ in [0, 2π]\". So the main assumption here is about the domain of θ. Each assumption should be a single line addressing one property or condition of one object. In this case, the object is θ, and its condition is that it's within the interval [0, 2π]. \n\nBut wait, the original example had two assumptions, but in this case, is there another assumption? The identity itself doesn't have additional conditions unless there's an implicit assumption about how sine and cosine are defined. The question mentions different characterizations, so maybe there's an assumption related to the definitions used. However, the problem as stated doesn't specify a particular characterization, so perhaps the only explicit assumption is the domain of θ. \n\nTherefore, the assumption should be that θ is in the interval [0, 2π]. The problem is to prove the identity sin²θ + cos²θ = 1. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other hidden assumptions. The example included an assumption about n being an integer and divisible by 7, but here, the problem is more straightforward. The user might be referring to different methods like using the unit circle, right triangle definitions, power series, etc., but those are methods of proof, not assumptions. The problem statement itself doesn't restrict the method, so the only assumption is the domain of θ.\n\nThus, the formatted problem should have one assumption about θ being in [0, 2π] and the problem statement asking to prove the identity. Let me check the example again to ensure consistency. The example had assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property. Here, only one assumption is needed.",
