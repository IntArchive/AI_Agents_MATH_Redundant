    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that (φ^400 + 1)/φ^200 is an integer, where φ is the golden ratio. Hmm, first, I need to recall the properties of the golden ratio. The golden ratio φ is defined as (1 + sqrt(5))/2. It has some interesting algebraic properties. One key property is that φ satisfies the quadratic equation φ^2 = φ + 1. Maybe this can be used to simplify higher powers of φ.\n\nLet me think. Since φ^2 = φ + 1, perhaps we can find a recurrence relation for φ^n. For example, φ^3 = φ*φ^2 = φ*(φ + 1) = φ^2 + φ = (φ + 1) + φ = 2φ + 1. Similarly, φ^4 = φ*φ^3 = φ*(2φ + 1) = 2φ^2 + φ = 2(φ + 1) + φ = 3φ + 2. It seems that each power of φ can be expressed as a linear combination of φ and 1 with integer coefficients. If this pattern holds, then φ^n can be written as a_nφ + b_n, where a_n and b_n are integers. Then, φ^n + (something) might result in an integer.\n\nWait, the given expression is (φ^400 + 1)/φ^200. Let's simplify that. Let me denote n = 200. Then the expression becomes (φ^{2n} + 1)/φ^n. That simplifies to φ^n + φ^{-n} because φ^{2n}/φ^n = φ^n and 1/φ^n = φ^{-n}. So, the expression is φ^n + φ^{-n}. If n is an integer, maybe this sum is always an integer?\n\nSince φ is (1 + sqrt(5))/2, its conjugate is (1 - sqrt(5))/2, which I'll call ψ. I remember that φ and ψ are roots of the quadratic x^2 = x + 1. Also, φ*ψ = -1. So, ψ = -1/φ. Therefore, φ^{-n} = ψ^n. So, the expression φ^n + ψ^n. Since φ and ψ are conjugates, their sum might be an integer. For example, φ + ψ = 1, which is an integer. φ^2 + ψ^2 = (φ + 1) + (ψ + 1) = (φ + ψ) + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3. Similarly, φ^3 + ψ^3 = (2φ + 1) + (2ψ + 1) = 2(φ + ψ) + 2 = 2*1 + 2 = 4. It seems like φ^n + ψ^n is always an integer. If that's the case, then for n=200, φ^200 + ψ^200 is an integer. But ψ^200 = φ^{-200}, so the original expression is indeed φ^200 + φ^{-200} = integer. Therefore, (φ^{400} +1)/φ^{200} = φ^{200} + φ^{-200} is an integer.\n\nSo the key assumption here is that φ is the golden ratio, which satisfies φ^2 = φ + 1 and ψ = -1/φ. Then, the problem reduces to showing that φ^n + ψ^n is an integer for integer n. But the original problem didn't specify any constraints on φ, so the main assumption is just that φ is the golden ratio. Since the problem didn't mention anything else, maybe the only assumption is the definition of φ. Let me check the original question again. The user says \"where φ is the golden ratio\". So the assumption is just that φ is the golden ratio. The problem is to prove that the given expression is an integer. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumption is just φ is the golden ratio, and the problem is to prove the expression is an integer. The example given had an assumption about n being an integer and divisible by 7, but in this case, the main assumption is about the definition of φ. The problem itself is the rest.",
