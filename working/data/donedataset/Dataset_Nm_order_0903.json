    "Content": "Prove that $2018^{2019}> 2019^{2018}$ without induction, without Newton's binomial formula and without Calculus. This inequality is equivalent to $$\n2018^{1/2018}>2019^{1/2019}\n$$ One of my 'High school' student asked why the inequality is true. The whole class became interested in the problem.The demonstration that such inequality is true, using calculus, can be found here . But my students are not familiar with calculus. I can also show by induction and Newton's binomial formula that $ n^{(n + 1)}> (n + 1)^n $ , to $ n> 3$ , but my students are not familiar with mathematical induction. \nAnother limitation of my students is that they have not yet learned the  Newton's binomial formula. How to prove the inequality $2018^{2019}> 2019^{2018}$ without induction, without Newton's binomial formula and without calculus? That is how to prove this inequality for High school students without using Newton's binomial formula?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Compared to my first answer, this answer makes a simpler use of the same familiar identity, which is proved without explicit use of induction, thus: \\begin{align*}\nx^m - y^m & = x^m - (x^{m-1}y - x^{m-1}y) - (x^{m-2}y^2 - x^{m-2}y^2) - \\cdots - (xy^{m-1} - xy^{m-1}) - y^m \\\\\n& = (x^m - x^{m-1}y) + (x^{m-1}y - x^{m-2}y^2) + (x^{m-2}y^2 - x^{m-3}y^3) + \\cdots + (xy^{m-1} - y^m) \\\\\n& = (x - y)x^{m-1} + (x - y)x^{m-2}y + (x - y)x^{m-3}y^2 + \\cdots + (x - y)y^{m-1} \\\\\n& = (x - y)(x^{m-1} + x^{m-2}y + x^{m-3}y^2 + \\cdots + y^{m-1}).\n\\end{align*} The rest of the proof is a straightforward calculation. (It is based on a trick which was inspired loosely by nbarto's answer, but I am to blame for it!) Suppose $n \\geqslant 3$ . In the above identity, take $x = m = n+1$ , $y = n$ , and group together all but the first two terms in the brackets, obtaining: $$\n(n+1)^{n+1} - n^{n+1} = (n+1)^n + (n+1)^{n-1}n + [(n+1)^{n-2}n^2 + \\cdots + n^n].\n$$ There are $n-1$ terms in the square brackets, they are in strictly decreasing order, and the largest of them is $(n+1)^{n-2}n^2$ . Therefore: \\begin{align*}\n(n+1)^{n+1} - n^{n+1} & < (n+1)^n + (n+1)^{n-1}n + (n-1)(n+1)^{n-2}n^2 \\\\\n& = (n+1)^n + (n+1)^{n-2}[n(n+1) + n^2(n-1)] \\\\\n& = (n+1)^n + (n^3+n)(n+1)^{n-2}.\n\\end{align*} On the other hand: \\begin{align*}\n(n+1)^{n+1} - (n+1)^n & = n(n+1)^n \\\\\n& = (n+1)^n + (n-1)(n+1)^n \\\\\n& = (n+1)^n + (n-1)(n+1)^2(n+1)^{n-2} \\\\\n& = (n+1)^n + (n^2-1)(n+1)(n+1)^{n-2} \\\\\n& = (n+1)^n + (n^3 + n^2 - n - 1)(n+1)^{n-2}.\n\\end{align*} But: $$\n(n^3 + n^2 - n - 1) - (n^3 + n) = n^2 - 2n - 1 = (n - 1)^2 - 2 > 0,\n$$ therefore: $$\n(n+1)^{n+1} - n^{n+1} < (n+1)^{n+1} - (n+1)^n,\n$$ therefore $n^{n+1} > (n+1)^n$ . $\\square$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should list each condition line by line, and the problem is restated clearly. \n\nThe original problem is to prove that 2018^2019 > 2019^2018 without using induction, Newton's binomial formula, or calculus. The user also mentions that this is equivalent to 2018^(1/2018) > 2019^(1/2012019). The students are high school level, so the proof needs to be accessible without those advanced methods.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. Let me read through the problem again. The key points are:\n\n1. The inequality 2018^2019 > 2019^2018 must be proven.\n2. The proof cannot use induction, Newton's binomial formula, or calculus.\n3. The students are not familiar with those methods, so the solution must rely on more basic math concepts.\n\nSo the assumptions should list the constraints given in the problem. Each assumption is a single condition. Let's break them down:\n\n- The first assumption is about the inequality itself. But wait, the problem is to prove the inequality, so maybe the assumptions are more about the methods not allowed? Wait, looking at the example, the assumptions were about the variables involved (n is an integer, n is divisible by 7). Here, the problem doesn't state any conditions on the numbers except that they're integers, but the restrictions are on the methods. However, in the example, the assumption included properties of the object (n being an integer and divisible by 7). In this problem, the original problem doesn't state any assumptions on n other than it's given (2018 and 2019). But the problem's constraints are about the methods not being used. So perhaps in this case, the assumptions are the restrictions on the proof methods. Wait, but in the example, the assumptions were part of the problem's given conditions. Here, the problem's conditions are the inequality to prove, and the constraints on the methods are part of the problem's requirements. But the user's format requires \"Assumption\" to list all the problem's assumptions. Wait, the example's assumption was about the problem's variables. So maybe in this case, the problem's assumptions would be that the numbers are positive integers, but the user might not have stated that. Alternatively, perhaps there are no explicit assumptions other than the methods not being used. Hmm, this is a bit unclear.\n\nWait, looking at the example again: the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted assumption listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the original problem, the user had written \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the original problem, the user didn't mention n being divisible by 7. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect. Wait, no, looking back: the example's original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem's assumption is \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Because in the original problem, it's \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted assumption, they added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Unless there was a miscommunication. Alternatively, maybe the example is from a different problem where the original problem had an error. Hmm, but regardless, following the user's instruction, the task is to structure the given problem into Assumption and Problem sections as per the example.\n\nSo in the current problem, the user is asking to prove 2018^2019 > 2019^2018 without using induction, Newton's binomial, or calculus. The problem is equivalent to 2018^(1/2018) > 2019^(1/2019). So the assumptions here would be the restrictions on the methods. But in the example, the assumptions were about the variables, not the methods. So perhaps in this case, the assumptions are about the numbers involved? For example, 2018 and 2019 are positive integers. But that's obvious. Alternatively, maybe there are no specific assumptions except the given numbers. Wait, the problem is to compare 2018^2019 and 2019^2018. The only assumptions needed are that 2018 and 2019 are positive integers greater than 1, which is implicit. But perhaps the user wants to list the constraints as assumptions? Wait, the example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", which are conditions on the variable. Here, the problem's conditions are about the proof methods, not the variables. So maybe the user wants the Assumption section to list the restrictions on the proof methods. However, in the example, the assumptions were about the problem's variables, not the methods. So there's a discrepancy. Wait, the user's instruction says: \"Assumption: <All the assumptions of the problem should be listed line by line. Each assumption addresses only one property or condition, applied to one object>\". So the assumptions are the problem's premises, not the constraints on the solution method. Therefore, in this problem, the problem's assumptions would be that 2018 and 2019 are integers, but that's trivial. Alternatively, perhaps there are no explicit assumptions beyond what's given in the inequality. But the problem is to prove the inequality, so maybe there are no specific assumptions. However, the example included assumptions even when the original problem didn't state them (like n divisible by 7). That seems incorrect. Wait, perhaps the example was from a different problem where the user made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to structure the problem by listing the constraints on the variables. But in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is \"n is an integer\", but then there's an extra assumption \"n is divisible by 7\", which might not be in the original problem. That suggests that perhaps the example is flawed. \n\nGiven that confusion, perhaps in the current problem, the only assumption is that 2018 and 2019 are positive integers. But that's trivial. Alternatively, since the problem is to compare exponents, maybe there's an implicit assumption that exponent rules apply. But I think the user's intention is to list the problem's given conditions. In this case, the problem doesn't have explicit assumptions beyond the numbers given. So maybe the Assumption section can be left blank or state that 2018 and 2019 are positive integers. However, looking back at the example, even though the original problem was for every integer n, they listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, which is redundant. So following that pattern, here the assumptions would be:\n\n- 2018 and 2019 are positive integers.\n\nBut that's obvious. Alternatively, maybe there are no assumptions, but the problem is the inequality itself. However, the example includes assumptions even if they're part of the problem statement. So perhaps here, the assumptions are:\n\n- The problem must be proven without using mathematical induction.\n- The problem must be proven without using Newton's binomial formula.\n- The problem must be proven without using calculus.\n\nBut wait, the user's instruction says \"assumptions of the problem\", which are the premises given in the problem. The restrictions on the proof methods are part of the problem's requirements, not assumptions. Therefore, in this case, the problem's assumptions would be that 2018 and 2019 are positive integers, and perhaps that the inequality is equivalent to 2018^(1/2018) > 2019^(1/2019). But that equivalence is part of the problem's setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has no explicit assumptions beyond the numbers given. Therefore, the Assumption section might be empty, but the format requires listing assumptions. Alternatively, maybe the equivalence between the two inequalities is an assumption. Wait, the original problem states that the inequality is equivalent to the other form, so that's part of the problem's given information. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The inequality 2018^{2019} > 2019^{2018} is equivalent to 2018^{1/2018} > 2019^{1/2019}.\n\nBut I'm not sure. The example's assumptions were about the variables (n is integer, n divisible by 7), so perhaps here, since the problem involves 2018 and 2019, which are specific numbers, there's no variable assumption. Therefore, maybe there are no assumptions, but the format requires listing them. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to prove the inequality under the assumption that certain methods are excluded. But the user's example didn't include method restrictions as assumptions. \n\nThis is confusing. Given the example provided, where the original problem was to prove for every integer n, and the formatted assumptions were \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\", which seems incorrect because the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7. That suggests that maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Therefore, in the current problem, perhaps the assumptions should be:\n\n- 2018 and 2019 are positive integers greater than 1.\n\nBut that's trivial. Alternatively, the problem might not have any assumptions beyond the numbers given. Given the confusion from the example, perhaps the safest way is to list the key given conditions as assumptions. Since the problem states that the inequality is equivalent to 2018^{1/2018} > 2019^{1/2019}, maybe that's an assumption. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe inequality $2018^{2019} > 2019^{2018}$ is equivalent to $2018^{1/2018} > 2019^{1/2019}$.\n\nBut that's part of the problem's statement, not an assumption. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to prove the original inequality under the equivalence given. But the user wants to structure the problem, not the solution. \n\nGiven the example, perhaps the assumptions are the properties of the objects involved. In this case, the objects are 2018 and 2019. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- 2018 is a positive integer.\n- 2019 is a positive integer.\n- 2018 and 2019 are consecutive integers (since 2019 = 2018 + 1).\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's necessary. The example had assumptions about the variable n. Here, there are no variables, just specific numbers. Therefore, perhaps there are no assumptions needed beyond the problem statement. But the format requires an assumption section. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has no explicit assumptions, so the assumption section is empty. But the example included assumptions, so perhaps we need to list something. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, so the assumption was \"n is an integer\". But the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original problem. That seems like an error. Therefore, perhaps the user's example is incorrect, and the correct way is to list the problem's given conditions as assumptions. For the current problem, since the original problem states that the inequality is equivalent to another form, maybe that's an assumption. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe inequality $2018^{2019} > 2019^{2018}$ is equivalent to $2018^{1/2018} > 2019^{1/2019}$.\n\nBut that's part of the problem's transformation, not an assumption. The user is asking to prove the original inequality, so the equivalence is part of the approach. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions are the restrictions on the proof methods. But according to the example, assumptions are about the problem's variables, not the methods. \n\nThis is quite confusing. Given the example's inconsistency, maybe the user intended the assumptions to include any conditions or properties given in the problem. In this case, the problem states that the inequality is equivalent to another form, but that's part of the problem's setup, not an assumption. The main assumptions would be about the numbers, but they are specific. Therefore, perhaps there are no assumptions to list, but the format requires it. Alternatively, maybe the assumptions are the methods that cannot be used. But the example didn't list those as assumptions. \n\nTo resolve this, perhaps the safest way is to follow the example's structure, even if it's flawed. In the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, so the assumption was n is an integer, and then another assumption n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. That suggests that perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. Therefore, in the current problem, since there are no variables, maybe the assumptions are about the numbers. But since they are specific numbers, there's nothing to assume. Therefore, the assumption section might be empty, but that's not allowed. Alternatively, list that 2018 and 2019 are positive integers. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants the assumptions to be the restrictions on the proof methods. But according to the example, assumptions are about the problem's variables, not the proof methods. Therefore, given that the current problem doesn't have variables with conditions, maybe the assumption section is empty. However, the format requires it. Therefore, perhaps list:\n\nAssumption:\nThe proof must not use mathematical induction.\nThe proof must not use Newton's binomial formula.\nThe proof must not use calculus.\n\nBut according to the example, assumptions are about the problem's variables or conditions, not the solution's restrictions. Therefore, this might not be correct. \n\nGiven the confusion, I think the user's example is flawed, but we have to proceed. Since the original problem is to prove the inequality without certain methods, but the assumptions in the example were about the variables, here there are no variables, so perhaps no assumptions. But the format requires an assumption section. Therefore, maybe list:\n\nAssumption:\n2018 and 2019 are positive integers.\n\nBut that's trivial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem has no assumptions, but the example forces us to list something. Alternatively, the problem is to compare the exponents, so maybe the assumption is that exponent rules apply. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's equivalence is an assumption. The user states that the inequality is equivalent to the other form, so that's given. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nThe inequality $2018^{2019} > 2019^{2018}$ is equivalent to $2018^{1/2018} > 2019^{1/2019}$.\n\nBut that's part of the problem's statement. \n\nAlternatively, the problem is to prove the inequality for high school students without certain methods, so perhaps the assumptions are about the students' knowledge:\n\nAssumption:\nThe proof must be understandable to high school students.\nThe students are not familiar with calculus.\nThe students are not familiar with mathematical induction.\nThe students are not familiar with Newton's binomial formula.\n\nBut again, according to the example, assumptions are about the problem's variables, not the audience. \n\nThis is quite challenging. Given the example, the user included n being an integer and divisible by 7 as assumptions, even if the original problem didn't state the divisibility. Therefore, perhaps in this problem, even though the original problem doesn't state any assumptions on 2018 and 2019, we can list them as positive integers. \n\nAlternatively, given that the problem is to prove the inequality without certain methods, perhaps the assumptions are the restrictions:\n\nAssumption:\nThe proof must not use mathematical induction.\nThe proof must not use Newton's binomial formula.\nThe proof must not use calculus.\n\nBut according to the example's format, assumptions are about the problem's variables or conditions, not the solution's constraints. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to list the problem's variables' conditions. Since there are no variables, maybe no assumptions. But the example included assumptions even when the original problem didn't specify. \n\nGiven the confusion, I'll proceed to list the key given conditions as assumptions. The problem states that the inequality is equivalent to another form. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe inequality $2018^{2019} > 2019^{2018}$ is equivalent to $2018^{1/2018} > 2019^{1/2019}$.\n\nBut perhaps that's redundant. Alternatively, since the problem is to prove the original inequality, maybe the assumptions are just the numbers involved. Given the example's structure, I think the user expects the following:\n\nAssumption:\n2018 and 2019 are positive integers.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $2018^{2019} > 2019^{2018}$ without using induction, Newton's binomial formula, or calculus.\n\nBut in the original problem, the user also mentioned the equivalence. So perhaps the problem statement should include both inequalities. However, the example condensed the problem into a single statement. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nProblem:\nProve that $2018^{2019} > 2019^{2018}$ without using induction, Newton's binomial formula, or calculus.\n\nAnd the assumptions are the given conditions, which in this case, since there are no variables, perhaps none. But the example forced assumptions, so maybe list:\n\nAssumption:\n2018 and 2019 are consecutive integers with 2018 < 2019.\n\nBut that's redundant. Alternatively, given that the example had \"n is an integer\", perhaps here:\n\nAssumption:\n2018 and 2019 are integers.\n\nBut that's obvious. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, I'll proceed with the following:\n\nAssumption:\nThe proof must not use mathematical induction.\nThe proof must not use Newton's binomial formula.\nThe proof must not use calculus.\n\nBut according to the example's structure, assumptions are about the problem's variables or objects, not the proof's restrictions. Therefore, this might not be correct. \n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to prove the inequality, and the equivalence is provided, maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe inequality $2018^{2019} > 2019^{2018}$ is equivalent to $2018^{1/2018} > 2019^{1/2019}$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $2018^{2019} > 2019^{2018}$ without using induction, Newton's binomial formula, or calculus.\n\nBut the equivalence is part of the problem's transformation, not an assumption. \n\nAfter careful consideration, I think the best approach is to list the method restrictions as assumptions, even though the example didn't do that. Because the original problem explicitly states these restrictions, and they are conditions of the problem. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nThe proof must not use mathematical induction.\nThe proof must not use Newton's binomial formula.\nThe proof must not use calculus.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $2018^{2019} > 2019^{2018}$.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions are about the variables, not the methods. Hence, this might be incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, given that the example listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, which was part of the problem statement, here the problem doesn't have such variables. Therefore, perhaps there are no assumptions, but the format requires listing them. Since the example had assumptions even if redundant, perhaps here:\n\nAssumption:\n2018 and 2019 are positive integers.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $2018^{2019} > 2019^{2018}$ without using induction, Newton's binomial formula, or calculus.\n\nThat seems reasonable. The assumption is that 2018 and 2019 are positive integers, which is necessary for the exponentiation. Therefore, I'll proceed with that.",
