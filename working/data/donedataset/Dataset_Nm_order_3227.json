    "Content": "I am trying to work through Rudin. This is a question from chapter 11: Suppose that $\\{n_k\\}$ is an increasing sequence of positive integers and $E$ is the set of all $x$ in $(-\\pi,\\pi)$ at which $\\sin(n_kx)$ converges. Prove that $E$ has Lebesgue measure zero. Hint: For every subset $A$ of $E$, $\\int_A \\sin (n_kx) dx$ tends to zero, and $2\\int_{A} \\sin^2 (n_k x)dx$ tends to the measure of $A$. So, if I can use the hint, I'm pretty sure I can get the question. The thing is, I have no idea how to prove the hint. Using the hint, here's how I think you do the question: Define $f$ on $E$ as \n\\begin{align*}f(x)= \\lim_{k\\rightarrow \\infty} \\sin(n_kx) \\end{align*}\nNotice that $\\sin(n_kx)\\leq 1$, and $1\\in L$ on $A\\subset E$ for every measurable $A$ (since $E$ has finite measure), so Theorem $11.32$ in Rudin (the Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem) says\n\\begin{align*} \\int_A f(x) dx = \\int_A \\lim_{k\\rightarrow \\infty} \\sin(n_kx) =  \\lim_{k\\rightarrow \\infty} \\int_A \\sin(n_kx) = 0 \\end{align*}\n(by the first hint). But this was true for all $A\\subseteq E$, so by one of the questions on the last assignment, $f(x)=0$ almost everywhere on $E$ and so $f^2(x)=0$ almost everywhere on $E$. Using Theorem $11.32$ again, we get\n\\begin{align*} \\mu(A) = \\lim_{k \\rightarrow \\infty} \\int_A 2\\sin^2(n_kx) = 2\\int_A \\lim_{k\\rightarrow \\infty}  \\sin^2(n_kx)= 2 \\int_A f^2(x)=0 \\end{align*}\nTherefore $\\mu(E)=0$. Does anybody know how to prove the hint? Thanks!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The first part of the hint follows from the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma (which I will state).  We'll sketch the proof here as it is essentially the answer you are looking for.  You should be able to coerce this into seeing why the second statement is true (the difference is that instead of having the cancellation of $ \\sin(nx) $, $ \\sin^2(nx) $ fills up half roughly half the space of a rectangle). The Riemann-Lebesgue lemma: If $ f \\in L^1(\\mathbb R) $, then $$\n\\int_{\\mathbb R} f(x)\\sin(nx)\\,dx \\to 0\n$$ as $ n\\to\\infty $. To prove the lemma, recall that step functions with compact support are dense in $ L^1(\\mathbb R) $.  Thus using dominated convergence it is enough to prove the result for such functions.  However for a step function, the result follows from the straightforward calculation $$\n\\int_a^b \\sin(nx)\\,dx = -\\frac 1n(\\cos(bn)-\\cos(an))\n$$ The analogous statement for the second part is $$\n\\int_{\\mathbb R} f(x)\\sin^2(nx)\\,dx \\to \\frac 12 \\int_{\\mathbb R} f(x)\\,dx\n$$ Applying these results to $ \\chi_A $, the characteristic function of $ A $, we obtain the statements of the hint.  Note that replacing $ n $ by $ n_k $ does not change the argument at all, we simply need $ n_k $ to go off to infinity. A few ideas to take away from this: Instead of attempting to prove results directly, establish them first for \"nice\" objects and then hope \"nice\" objects are dense Instead of integrating $ f $ over $ A $, integrate $ f\\,\\chi_A $ over the entire domain P.S. I'd leave this as a comment, but cannot due to low reputation: there is a typo in the hint as you've typed it.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this problem. The user is working through Rudin's book, specifically Chapter 11. The question is about proving that a set E, where the sequence sin(n_k x) converges, has Lebesgue measure zero. The user provided a hint from the problem and their own approach using the hint. However, they need help proving the hint itself.\n\nFirst, I need to structure the problem according to the given format. The Assumptions section should list each condition applied to one object. The Problem section is the main question to be answered.\n\nLooking at the original problem: The set E is the set of all x in (-π, π) where sin(n_k x) converges. The sequence {n_k} is an increasing sequence of positive integers. The task is to prove E has Lebesgue measure zero. The hint mentions properties of integrals over subsets A of E involving sin(n_k x) and 2 sin²(n_k x).\n\nSo, the assumptions would include:\n- {n_k} is an increasing sequence of positive integers.\n- E is the set of all x in (-π, π) where sin(n_k x) converges.\n- For every subset A of E, the integral of sin(n_k x) over A tends to zero as k approaches infinity.\n- For every subset A of E, twice the integral of sin²(n_k x) over A tends to the measure of A as k approaches infinity.\n\nWait, but the user is trying to prove the hint. Wait, the problem is to prove that E has measure zero, but the user already knows how to use the hint, but needs to prove the hint. However, in the original problem statement, the hint is given. So when structuring the problem, the original problem is \"Prove that E has Lebesgue measure zero\", and the assumptions are the given conditions (the properties of E and {n_k}).\n\nBut the user's question is actually about proving the hint. Wait, no, the original problem states: \"Suppose that {n_k} is an increasing sequence of positive integers and E is the set... Prove that E has Lebesgue measure zero. Hint: For every subset A of E, ∫_A sin(n_k x) dx tends to zero, and 2∫_A sin²(n_k x) dx tends to the measure of A.\"\n\nSo the problem is to prove E has measure zero, and the hint is given. The user is asking for help proving the hint, but in the problem statement, the user already used the hint to solve the main problem and is now asking how to prove the hint.\n\nBut according to the user's original post, they need to structure the problem as per the example. The example extracted assumptions from the original problem. So here, the original problem states that {n_k} is increasing, E is the set where sin(n_k x) converges, and the task is to prove E has measure zero. The assumptions would be:\n\n- {n_k} is an increasing sequence of positive integers.\n- E is the set of all x in (-π, π) at which sin(n_k x) converges.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that E has Lebesgue measure zero.\n\nBut the user's own approach uses the hint, but the hint is part of the original problem. So in the formatted problem, do we include the hint's statements as assumptions? Wait, in the example given, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. The formatted problem listed those as assumptions, then the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut in this case, the original problem states the hint. However, the user is supposed to filter out unrelated information. The user's own solution attempt uses the hint, but the problem as posed is to prove E has measure zero, with the hint provided. However, the user is asking for how to prove the hint. Wait, but the problem they need to structure is the original problem from the book, not the user's question about the hint.\n\nWait, the user is posting a question on Math Stack Exchange, which includes their own attempt. The original problem they are trying to solve is from Rudin: \"Prove that E has Lebesgue measure zero\", given the conditions on {n_k} and E. The user then shows their approach using the hint but needs help proving the hint. However, when structuring the problem according to the format, the task is to present the original problem (from Rudin), filtering out the user's own attempt and their request for help with the hint. So the Assumptions would be the given conditions in the problem (the increasing sequence {n_k}, E defined as the set where sin(n_k x) converges in (-π, π)), and the Problem is to prove E has measure zero. The hint is part of the problem statement but perhaps not part of the assumptions or the problem statement to be formatted. Wait, the example included assumptions that were perhaps implicit in the problem. For instance, in the example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the user included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, even though the problem stated \"for every integer n\". So similarly, in this case, the problem states that {n_k} is increasing sequence of positive integers, E is the set where sin(n_k x) converges. So those are the assumptions. The problem is to prove E has Lebesgue measure zero. The hint is part of the problem's hint, but in the formatting example, the user included the assumption from the original problem, not the user's own thoughts. Therefore, the formatted problem should list the assumptions given in the problem statement, and the problem is the question to be answered. The user's own attempt and their question about the hint are part of their post, but when structuring the problem, we need to present the original problem's conditions and task. Therefore, the Assumptions would be:\n\n- {n_k} is an increasing sequence of positive integers.\n- E is the set of all x in (-π, π) at which sin(n_k x) converges.\n\nProblem: Prove that E has Lebesgue measure zero.\n\nThe hint given in the problem is part of the problem statement, but in the example provided, the user included an assumption from the problem (n is divisible by 7). But in the original problem here, the user is told to structure the problem as per the example, which includes filtering out unrelated information. Since the problem is to prove E has measure zero given {n_k} and E as defined, the hint is part of the problem's guidance but perhaps not part of the assumptions. However, in the example, the user included an assumption (n divisible by 7) that was part of the problem's statement. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem included an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that example seems like it might be a mistake. Wait, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption is that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, which is incorrect. Wait, no. Wait, perhaps the example was a different problem. Let me check again.\n\nThe example given was:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem:\nProve that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. The original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should only be that n is an integer. But in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\", which is an extra assumption. That seems incorrect. So maybe there was a mistake in the example. Therefore, perhaps the user wants to filter out the necessary assumptions, even if they are part of the problem's universal quantifier. Hmm, maybe the example is wrong, but the user provided it as an example. Therefore, following that example, even if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, and maybe an additional condition if applicable. But in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the original problem in the example had a different condition. Wait, perhaps the original problem in the example had a typo or the user made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the example is a different problem where the divisibility by 91 requires that n is divisible by 7. But 91 is 7*13, so maybe the problem actually requires that n is divisible by both 7 and 13. But regardless, the example shows that the formatted problem includes the assumptions from the problem, possibly including quantifiers.\n\nBut in our current problem, the original problem is \"Suppose that {n_k} is an increasing sequence of positive integers and E is the set... Prove that E has Lebesgue measure zero.\" Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- {n_k} is an increasing sequence.\n- {n_k} is a sequence of positive integers.\n- E is the set of all x in (-π, π) where sin(n_k x) converges.\n\nProblem: Prove that E has Lebesgue measure zero.\n\nThe hint provided in the problem is part of the problem statement but is not an assumption. Therefore, the formatted problem should list the given assumptions and the problem to prove.\n\nSo, following the example's structure, even though the example might have had an error, the correct approach here is to list the assumptions as given in the problem's \"Suppose\" clause.\n\nTherefore, the Assumptions are:\n\n- {n_k} is an increasing sequence of positive integers.\n- E is the set of all x in (-π, π) at which {sin(n_k x)} converges.\n\nProblem: Prove that E has Lebesgue measure zero.\n\nI think that's correct. The user's own attempt and their question about the hint are part of their post but are not part of the structured problem. The structured problem is just the original problem from Rudin.",
