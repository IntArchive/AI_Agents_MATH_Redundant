    "Content": "Given a random variable $X\\sim\\mathcal N(0,\\sigma^2)$, how can we prove that $E[X^4]=3\\sigma^4$? I am having trouble even starting with the proof.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "First with $\\sigma=1$ , omitting the range $(-\\infty,\\infty)$ for convenience and integrating twice by parts $$E[X^4]=\\frac{\\displaystyle\\int x^4e^{-x^2/2}dx}{\\displaystyle\\int e^{-x^2/2}dx}=\\frac{-x^3e^{-x^2/2}+3\\displaystyle\\int x^2e^{-x^2/2}dx}{\\displaystyle\\int e^{-x^2/2}dx}=\\frac{0-3xe^{-x^2/2}+3\\displaystyle\\int e^{-x^2/2}dx}{\\displaystyle\\int e^{-x^2/2}dx}=3.$$ Then by rescaling the variable, $$3\\sigma^4.$$ By observing the pattern, you easily generalize to $$E[X^{2n}]=(2n-1)!!\\sigma^{2n}.$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure a problem from Math Stack Exchange into their specified format. The example they gave involves breaking down the problem's assumptions and stating the problem clearly.\n\nLooking at the provided Math Stack Exchange question: \"Proving E[X^4]=3σ^4\". The user is asking how to prove that the fourth moment of a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance σ² is 3σ⁴. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that X is a normal random variable with mean 0 and variance σ². So the assumptions should list each property individually. That means:\n\n1. X is a random variable.\n2. X follows a normal distribution.\n3. The mean of X is 0.\n4. The variance of X is σ².\n\nThese are separate assumptions, each addressing one property of X. Then the problem is to prove that the expected value of X⁴ is 3σ⁴. \n\nI need to make sure not to include any extra information. The original question mentions having trouble starting the proof, but that's part of the user's struggle, not part of the problem's structure. So the formatted problem should just list the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nAnother thing to check is whether the example provided matches this structure. In the example, the assumptions are about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions are about the properties of X. Each assumption is on a separate line, each applying to one object (in this case, X). \n\nI should avoid mentioning methods or hints in the assumptions. Just the given conditions. So the answer should correctly parse the problem into Assumption and Problem sections as per the example.",
