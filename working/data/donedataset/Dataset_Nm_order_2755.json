    "Content": "Let $A,B$ two non-empty compact subsets of a normed space X. How can we prove that the set $S=A+B=\\{a+b : a \\in A, b \\in B\\}$ is compact? Here's my reasoning: Let $\\Omega = \\{\\Omega_1, \\Omega_2,…\\}$ be an open cover of $S$. $\\Omega$ induces two open cover $X,Y$ respectively of $A,B$, where $X_i = \\{a \\in A : a+b \\in \\Omega_i~~for~some~b\\}$ $Y_i = \\{b \\in B : a+b \\in \\Omega_i~~for~some~a\\}$ in practice $\\Omega_i = X_i + Y_i$. Now my idea is build a finite subcover this way: consider a finite subcover $X_F = \\{X_j : j \\in J\\}$ where $J$ is a finite set of indices. If $Y_F = \\{Y_j : j \\in J\\}$ is a finite subcover of $B$, then we are done as $\\{\\Omega_j : j \\in J\\}$ is a subcover of $\\Omega$. Otherwise we can keep adding indexes to set $J$ until $Y_F$ becomes a finite subcover of $B$. This is not too formal but I don't want to make a simple question unreadable, I think the idea should be clear. Does this works? Is there a better/easier way to get the same result?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Remember $+$ is a function defined as $$+:\\begin{cases} A\\times B\\to A+B \\\\ (a,b)\\mapsto a+b\\end{cases}$$ Since addition is continuous on normed spaces and $A+B$ is the image of the compact set $A\\times B$ under this map, the image is compact.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so the user wants me to structure this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me first understand the original problem and the user's example.\n\nThe original question is about proving that the sum of two non-empty compact subsets in a normed space is compact. The user provided their reasoning using open covers and is asking if their approach works or if there's a better method.\n\nLooking at the example given, the \"Assumption\" section lists each condition line by line, each applying to one object. For the original problem in the example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. But in the problem presented here, the user is talking about compact subsets A and B in a normed space X. \n\nSo, I need to extract the assumptions from the problem. The problem states: Let A and B be two non-empty compact subsets of a normed space X. The set S = A + B is to be proven compact.\n\nAssumptions here would be:\n1. A is a non-empty compact subset of X.\n2. B is a non-empty compact subset of X.\n3. X is a normed space.\n\nEach assumption is about one object (A, B, X) and their properties (non-empty, compact, being a normed space). The problem is to prove S is compact.\n\nThe user's attempt uses open covers and constructing subcovers, but the problem statement itself doesn't add more assumptions beyond what's given. So the assumptions are straightforward. The problem is to prove S = A + B is compact.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is a single line and refers to one object. The original problem didn't mention any additional conditions like the space being Hausdorff or complete, just that it's a normed space. So the assumptions are as listed above.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have those three assumptions and the problem statement as proving S is compact.",
