    "Content": "I recently came across this proposition that the eigenvalues of a product of square matrices are invariant under cyclic permutation of the product order. Is there perhaps some group theoretic way of proving this proposition? I've tried a few cases and it seems to be true, but a direct proof has proven elusive. Or is a proof not so simple?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This is a consequence of the fact that the spectrum of $AB$ and $BA$ coincide. Suppose that $\\lambda$ is a non-zero eigenvalue of $AB$ with eigenvector $\\mathbf{v}$. Then\n$$AB\\mathbf{v} = \\lambda\\mathbf{v}\\implies BA(B\\mathbf{v}) = \\lambda B\\mathbf{v}$$\nso that $B\\mathbf{v}$ is an eigenvector of $\\lambda$ for $BA$. Clearly $AB$ and $BA$ are either both invertible or non-invertible so $0$ as an eigenvalue also coincides. Therefore $\\sigma(AB) = \\sigma(BA)$ where $\\sigma$ denotes the spectrum. This fact then extends to any cyclic permutation (much like how the cyclic permutation property of the trace also follows from $\\mathrm{tr}(AB) = \\mathrm{tr}(BA)$). For example, by continuously applying the exchange property to this cluster of $4$ matrices, we have\n$$\\sigma([ABC]D) = \\sigma(D[ABC]) = \\sigma([DAB]C) = \\sigma(C[DAB]) = \\cdots  $$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should list each condition applied to one object, and then state the problem.\n\nLooking at the original question: It's about eigenvalues of a product of square matrices being invariant under cyclic permutation. The user mentions they came across a proposition stating this and are asking for a group-theoretic proof or if it's not simple. They tried cases and it seems true but can't find a direct proof.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The key points here are:\n\n1. The product involves square matrices. So each matrix in the product is square.\n2. The permutation considered is cyclic. So rearranging the matrices in a cyclic order.\n3. The eigenvalues of the product are invariant under such permutations.\n\nWait, but the problem is to prove this invariance. So the assumptions would be the conditions given in the proposition. Let me parse the original question again.\n\nThe proposition says: \"the eigenvalues of a product of square matrices are invariant under cyclic permutation of the product order.\" So the assumptions here are:\n\n- We have a product of square matrices.\n- The permutation of the product order is cyclic.\n- The eigenvalues are considered for the product.\n\nBut maybe each assumption should be a single line. Let's break it down.\n\nAssumptions:\n1. The matrices in the product are square.\n2. The permutation of the product order is cyclic.\n\nProblem: Prove that the eigenvalues of the product are invariant under such cyclic permutations.\n\nBut wait, the original question didn't specify any additional constraints like matrix size (e.g., n x n) or over which field (complex numbers?), but usually eigenvalues are considered over algebraically closed fields like complex numbers. However, since the user didn't mention, maybe we shouldn't assume that. But the example given in the user's example didn't include implicit assumptions like \"n is an integer\" which was part of the original problem. In the example, the user included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, but the original problem didn't state the divisibility by 7. Wait, actually in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. Wait, that might not be correct. Wait, the original problem in the example was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, the assumptions list \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems contradictory. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That would change the problem. Wait, perhaps there was a mistake in the example. But since the user provided that example, perhaps they intended that the original problem had an error, or maybe they wanted to filter out unrelated information. Hmm, this is confusing. But perhaps the example was not correctly formatted. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the only assumption is that n is an integer, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. But in the formatted problem, the assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\", which is not part of the original problem. That seems incorrect. Maybe the example was not a good one. But regardless, the user wants us to structure the current problem as per the example.\n\nSo back to the current problem. The proposition is that eigenvalues are invariant under cyclic permutation of the product order. The question is whether this is true and how to prove it. The key assumptions are that the matrices are square (since eigenvalues are defined for square matrices) and that the permutation is cyclic. The problem is to prove the invariance of eigenvalues under such permutations.\n\nSo, structuring this:\n\nAssumption:\nEach matrix in the product is square.\nThe product order is cyclically permuted.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the eigenvalues of the product of square matrices are invariant under cyclic permutation of the product order.\n\nWait, but maybe more precise. The problem states \"eigenvalues of a product of square matrices under cyclic permutation\". So each matrix is square, the product is cyclicly permuted, and the eigenvalues of the product remain the same. But perhaps the assumptions need to be more specific. For example, maybe that the product is of multiple square matrices, but the user's example had only one variable (n), so maybe each assumption line is one condition. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which is an assumption on n, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. But the formatted problem lists two assumptions: \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7; it's part of the problem's conclusion. That seems like a mistake. But perhaps the example was incorrectly formatted by the user, but since they provided it, we have to follow their format even if it's incorrect. So maybe in their format, the assumptions include both the given conditions and possibly other inferred ones? Or perhaps they made a typo. For example, maybe in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 when n is divisible by 7, but the user wrote it wrong. Anyway, moving on.\n\nIn the current problem, the key assumptions from the proposition are:\n\n1. The product involves square matrices.\n2. The permutation of the product order is cyclic.\n\nThe problem is to prove that eigenvalues are invariant under such permutations. So structuring as:\n\nAssumption:\nEach matrix in the product is square.\nThe permutation of the product order is cyclic.\nProblem:\nProve that the eigenvalues of the product are invariant under cyclic permutation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first assumption is that all matrices are square, and the product is cyclically permuted. Then the problem is to prove eigenvalue invariance. That seems to fit the user's example structure, where each assumption is a single condition applied to one object.\n\nSo, the answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nEach matrix in the product is square,\nThe product order is cyclically permuted.\nProblem:\nProve that the eigenvalues of a product of square matrices are invariant under cyclic permutation of the product order.\n###END_OF_FORMAT###\n\nWait, but the original question mentions \"product of square matrices\" and \"cyclic permutation of the product order\". So the assumptions are that we have a product of square matrices and that their order is cyclically permuted. The problem is to show eigenvalues of the product are invariant under such permutations. Yes, that seems right.",
