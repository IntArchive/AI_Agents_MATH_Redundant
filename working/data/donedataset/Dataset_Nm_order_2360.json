    "Content": "Let $A\\in M_n(\\mathbb{C})$ s.t. $A\\not= I_n$. Show that there is $X\\in M_n(\\mathbb{C})$ s.t. $X$ and $AX$ have no common eigenvalues. Perhaps it is easy to prove, but I don't know how to do. Comment. The proof is easy when $1\\notin spectrum(A)$. Moreover, if the asked result is true, then we can show that $\\{X;X,AX \\;\\;\\text{have no common eigenvalues}\\}$ is Zariski open dense in $M_n(\\mathbb{C})$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This is ugly but I hope it works. Assume $A$ is already in Jordan normal form. We consider three possibilities: (a) $A$ has not any trivial ($1\\times1$) Jordan block for the eigenvalue $1$. Let $A=J\\oplus F$, where $J$ is a direct sum of all nontrivial Jordan blocks for the eigenvalue $1$ and $F$ contains only Jordan blocks for other eigenvalues. Using a similarity transform, we can make the superdiagonal entries of $J$ arbitrarily large, while leaving its diagonal entries unchanged. So, we may assume that all singular values of this modified $J$ are different from $1$. Take $X=J^T \\oplus I$, so that $AX=(JJ^T)\\oplus F$. The only eigenvalue of $X$ is $1$, but all eigenvalues of $AX$ are different from $1$. (b) $A$ has at least one trivial Jordan block for the eigenvalue $1$, and $A$ is not diagonalizable. Let $A=I_k\\oplus J\\oplus A'$, where $J$ is some $m\\times m$ nontrivial Jordan block (its eigenvalue is irrelevant) and $A'$ has not any trivial Jordan block for the eigenvalue $1$. By (a), there is some $X'$, whose only eigenvalue is $1$, such that $X'$ and $A'X'$ have non-overlapping spectra. So, we only need to cope with the submatrix $I_k\\oplus J$ of $A$. When the superdiagonal entries of $J$ are sufficiently large, all singular values of $J$ are different from $1$. Therefore, by a further change of basis, we may assume that $A=I_k\\oplus SV^\\ast\\oplus A'$, where $SV^\\ast$ is a SVD with all singular values $s_1,s_2,\\ldots,s_m\\ne1$. Let $v$ be the first column of $V$ and let $W$ contains the other columns. Take\n$$\nX=\\pmatrix{0&I_k&0\\\\ v&0&W}\\oplus (tX')\n$$\nfor some $t>0$. (Here the first summand is $(k+m)\\times(k+m)$; the zero submatrices within it are not necessarily square. The second summand $tX'$ is $(n-k-m)\\times(n-k-m)$; it has the same size as $A'$.) Since the first summand is unitary, the eigenvalues of $X$ either have unit moduli or are equal to $t$. In contrast, the eigenvalues of\n$$\nAX=\\left(\\begin{array}{cc|c}\n0&I_k\\\\\ns_1&0\\\\\n\\hline &&\\operatorname{diag}(s_2,\\ldots,s_m)\n\\end{array}\\right)\\oplus (tA'X')\n$$\nare $s_2,\\ldots,s_m$, the $(k+1)$-th roots of $s_1$, and those eigenvalues of $tA'X'$. So, when $t$ is sufficiently large, the spectra of $X$ and $AX$ do not overlap. (c) $A$ is diagonal. Let $A=(I_k\\oplus\\lambda_1)\\oplus\\operatorname{diag}(\\lambda_2,\\ldots,\\lambda_{n-k})$, where each $\\lambda_j\\ne1$. In this case we can take $X=\\pmatrix{0&1\\\\ &\\ddots&1\\\\ &&\\ddots&\\ddots\\\\ &&&0&1\\\\ c&0&\\cdots&\\cdots&0}\\oplus I_{n-k-1}$ for some number $c\\in\\mathbb C$. The spectrum of $X$ contains $1$ and the $(k+1)$-th roots of $c$, while the spectrum of $AX$ contains $\\lambda_2,\\ldots,\\lambda_{n-k}$ and the $(k+1)$-th roots of $c\\lambda_1$. As $\\lambda_1\\ne1$, we can pick $c$ such that the two spectra do no overlap.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me first read through the problem carefully.\n\nThe original question is titled \"X, AX have no common eigenvalues\" and the user wants to show that for a matrix A (not equal to the identity matrix) in M_n(C), there exists a matrix X such that X and AX have no common eigenvalues. The user also mentions some comments about the proof being easier when 1 is not in the spectrum of A and mentions Zariski open dense sets, but that part might be extra information.\n\nNow, according to the example provided, I need to filter out unrelated information and structure the problem with Assumptions and Problem sections. The example had assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. \n\nLooking at the original problem: The key points are that A is an n x n complex matrix, A is not equal to the identity matrix, and we need to find X such that X and AX share no eigenvalues. The user mentions \"A ≠ I_n\" as a condition, and the problem is about existence of such an X.\n\nSo the assumptions should include:\n\n1. A is an element of M_n(C) (the space of n x n complex matrices)\n2. A is not equal to the identity matrix I_n\n\nThen the problem statement is to show there exists an X in M_n(C) such that X and AX have no common eigenvalues.\n\nWait, but in the example given, the assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. The problem then was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. So the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem.\n\nIn the current case, the problem states \"Let A ∈ M_n(C) s.t. A ≠ I_n. Show that there exists X ∈ M_n(C) s.t. X and AX have no common eigenvalues.\" So the assumptions are exactly A ∈ M_n(C) and A ≠ I_n. The problem is to show existence of X with the stated property.\n\nThe user's comments about the case when 1 is not in the spectrum of A and the Zariski open dense set might be additional context but not part of the core problem. So we should exclude those from the formatted problem.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nA is an element of M_n(ℂ),\nA is not equal to I_n.\nProblem:\nShow that there exists X ∈ M_n(ℂ) such that X and AX have no common eigenvalues.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is on a separate line and addresses one property. Here, two assumptions: one about A being in the matrix space, and another that A is not the identity matrix. The problem is the existence of X with the eigenvalue condition.\n\nYes, that seems correct. The user's example had two assumptions as well, each on their own line. So this structure matches the example provided.",
