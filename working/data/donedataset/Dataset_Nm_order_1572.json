    "AcceptedAnswer": "Denote $X=X_1\\times X_2$, $\\mu=\\mu_1\\times\\mu_2$, $\\nu=\\nu_1\\times\\nu_2$, $\\mathcal{M}=\\mathcal{M}_1\\times\\mathcal{M}_2$ and \n$$f(x_1,x_2)=\\dfrac{d\\nu_1}{d\\mu_1}(x_1)\\dfrac{d\\nu_2}{d\\mu_2}(x_2).$$ \nEvidently $f$ is non-negative,  $\\mathcal{M}$ measurable and $\\mu$ locally integrable. Then as @copper.hat commented, by Fubini's theorem (or Tonelli's theorem instead), we have: $$\\nu(E_1\\times E_2)=\\nu_1(E_1)\\cdot\\nu_2(E_2)=\\int_{E_1}\\dfrac{d\\nu_1}{d\\mu_1}d\\mu_1\\times\\int_{E_2}\\dfrac{d\\nu_2}{d\\mu_2}d\\mu_2=\\int_{E_1\\times E_2}f~d\\mu.$$ Consider the collection $$\\mathcal{C}:=\\{E\\in \\mathcal{M}:\\nu(E)=\\int_E f~d\\mu\\}$$ \nand we want to show $\\mathcal{C}=\\mathcal{M}$. We have shown $\\Pi:=\\{E\\in\\mathcal{M}:E=E_1\\times E_2\\}\\subset \\mathcal{C}$, it suffices to show $\\mathcal{C}$ is a $\\sigma$-algebra. First let us assume that $\\mu(X)<\\infty$. Since $\\Pi$ is a $\\pi$-system , we only need to show $\\mathcal{C}$ is a $\\lambda$-system : (i) $X\\in\\mathcal{C}$; (ii) if $D,E\\in\\mathcal{C}$ with $D\\subset E$, then $E\\setminus D\\in\\mathcal{C}$; and  if $\\{E_n:n\\ge 1\\}\\subset \\mathcal{C}$ is an increasing sequence, then $\\cup_n E_n\\in\\mathcal{C}$.  The first two items are obvious and the last one follows from monotone convergence theorem . Now we have proved $\\mathcal{C}=\\mathcal{M}$ with the additional assumption $\\mu(X)<\\infty$. For general $X$, let $\\{F_n=F_{1,n}\\times F_{2,n}:n\\ge 1\\}\\subset\\Pi\\subset\\mathcal{C}$ be such that $\\mu(F_n)<\\infty$ for every $n$ and $\\cup_n F_n=X$. Then the argument before implies that for every $n$, $\\{E\\in \\mathcal{C}:E\\subset F_n\\}=\\{E\\in \\mathcal{M}:E\\subset F_n\\}$. Then given $E\\in\\mathcal{M}$, $E\\subset F_n\\in\\mathcal{C}$ for every $n$, so again by monotone convergence theorem, $E\\in\\mathcal{C}$, which completes the proof. Therefore, when $E\\in\\mathcal{M}$, $\\nu(E)=\\int_E f~d\\mu$. The conclusion follows.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the user wants to show that the product of two Radon-Nikodym derivatives is the Radon-Nikodym derivative of the product measures. First, I need to recall what the Radon-Nikodym theorem states. If we have two σ-finite measures, ν and μ, and ν is absolutely continuous with respect to μ, then there exists a measurable function f such that ν(E) = ∫_E f dμ for all measurable sets E. That function f is the Radon-Nikodym derivative, dν/dμ.\n\nNow, in this problem, we have two measure spaces, each with their own σ-finite measures ν_j and μ_j where ν_j ≪ μ_j for j=1,2. The task is to show that the product measure ν₁×ν₂ is absolutely continuous with respect to μ₁×μ₂, and that the Radon-Nikodym derivative of the product measures is the product of the individual derivatives.\n\nThe user mentioned trying to use the fact that if the product measure (μ₁×μ₂)(E) = 0, then (ν₁×ν₂)(E) = 0. They considered measurable rectangles and tried to form a σ-algebra containing sets where either the product μ₁×μ₂ measure is positive or the ν₁×ν₂ measure is zero. But it didn't quite work. Hmm.\n\nLet me think. To show absolute continuity, suppose E is a set in the product σ-algebra such that (μ₁×μ₂)(E) = 0. We need to show that (ν₁×ν₂)(E) = 0. Since ν_j ≪ μ_j, we know that if μ_j(A) = 0, then ν_j(A) = 0 for each j. But how does this translate to the product measure?\n\nFor measurable rectangles A×B, if (μ₁×μ₂)(A×B) = μ₁(A)μ₂(B) = 0, then either μ₁(A)=0 or μ₂(B)=0. Since ν₁≪μ₁ and ν₂≪μ₂, this would imply ν₁(A)=0 or ν₂(B)=0, so ν₁×ν₂(A×B)=0. So the condition holds for rectangles. Now, the collection of sets E where (μ₁×μ₂)(E)=0 implies (ν₁×ν₂)(E)=0 should form a σ-algebra. Since it contains all rectangles, which generate the product σ-algebra, it should be the entire σ-algebra. Wait, but the user tried a similar approach. Maybe they made a mistake in defining the family of sets?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the uniqueness of the Radon-Nikodym derivative. If we can show that the product of the derivatives satisfies the integral condition, then it must be the derivative. Let's see. For any measurable set E in the product σ-algebra, we need to have (ν₁×ν₂)(E) = ∫_E (dν₁/dμ₁)(x₁)(dν₂/dμ₂)(x₂) d(μ₁×μ₂). Since the product measure is defined via integration, this might follow from Fubini's theorem. Let me check.\n\nTake E = A×B. Then (ν₁×ν₂)(A×B) = ν₁(A)ν₂(B) = ∫_A dν₁/dμ₁ dμ₁ × ∫_B dν₂/dμ₂ dμ₂ = ∫_{A×B} (dν₁/dμ₁)(x₁)(dν₂/dμ₂)(x₂) d(μ₁×μ₂). So for rectangles, the equality holds. Since both sides are measures and agree on rectangles, by the π-λ theorem, they agree on the entire product σ-algebra. Hence, the product of the derivatives is indeed the Radon-Nikodym derivative for the product measure. That seems right.\n\nBut the user was stuck on the absolute continuity part. Maybe they need to use the fact that if a product measure is zero, then the section integrals are zero. Wait, by Tonelli's theorem, for non-negative measurable functions, the integral over the product is the double integral. So if (μ₁×μ₂)(E) = 0, then integrating the characteristic function of E over μ₁×μ₂ gives zero. So ∫∫ χ_E(x,y) dμ₁(x)dμ₂(y) = 0. This implies that for μ₂-a.e. y, the x-section E_y has μ₁ measure zero. Since ν₁ ≪ μ₁, ν₁(E_y) = 0 for μ₂-a.e. y. Then integrating ν₁(E_y) over ν₂(y) would be zero. Wait, but ν₂ is also absolutely continuous w.r. to μ₂. Maybe we can use iterated integrals.\n\nAlternatively, since ν₁×ν₂(E) = ∫_{X₂} ν₁(E^{x₂}) dν₂(x₂), where E^{x₂} is the x₂-section of E. Since (μ₁×μ₂)(E)=0, for μ₂-a.e. x₂, μ₁(E^{x₂})=0. Because ν₂ ≪ μ₂, the set of x₂ where μ₁(E^{x₂}) >0 is μ₂-null, hence ν₂-null. Therefore, for ν₂-a.e. x₂, μ₁(E^{x₂})=0, which implies ν₁(E^{x₂})=0. So ν₁(E^{x₂})=0 for ν₂-a.e. x₂, hence the integral over ν₂ is zero. Therefore, ν₁×ν₂(E)=0. That works!\n\nSo, putting it all together, the key steps are:\n\n1. Show that if (μ₁×μ₂)(E)=0, then for μ₂-a.e. x₂, μ₁(E^{x₂})=0.\n2. Since ν₂ ≪ μ₂, the set where μ₁(E^{x₂})>0 is ν₂-null.\n3. Hence, for ν₂-a.e. x₂, ν₁(E^{x₂})=0.\n4. Therefore, integrating ν₁(E^{x₂}) over ν₂ gives zero, so ν₁×ν₂(E)=0.\n\nThen, for the Radon-Nikodym derivative part, use the fact that the product of derivatives works on rectangles and extend via uniqueness.\n\nSo, the assumptions are each ν_j is σ-finite and absolutely continuous w.r. to μ_j, which are also σ-finite. The problem is to show the absolute continuity of the product measures and the derivative formula.",
