    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor, read a question from Math Stack Exchange, filter out unrelated info, and structure it into the specified format. The example given shows that assumptions should list each condition on one line, applied to one object. Then the problem statement is restated concisely.\n\nLooking at the problem here: It's about showing the limit as alpha approaches infinity of the supremum over t in [0,T] of the absolute value of e^{-alpha t} times the integral from 0 to t of e^{alpha s} dB_s equals zero almost everywhere. The Brownian motion is standard, starting at zero.\n\nFirst, identify the assumptions. The original problem mentions that (B_s)_{s>=0} is a real standard Brownian motion starting from zero. So that's one assumption. The problem involves taking the limit as alpha approaches infinity, and the supremum over t in [0,T]. The question is about showing this limit is zero a.e.\n\nWait, the example given had two assumptions: one about n being integer and another about divisibility by 7. Here, the problem mentions a standard Brownian motion starting at zero. That seems like one assumption. The time interval [0,T] is another condition? Or maybe the conditions are only the properties of B_s. Let me check the example again. In the example, they split the original problem's assumptions into n being integer and n being divisible by 7, even though the original problem only stated \"for every integer n\". Wait, maybe in the example they considered that the problem may have had more assumptions. Wait, actually, the original problem in the example was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that might be incorrect. Wait, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should just be that n is an integer. However, the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original problem. That seems like a mistake. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example? Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumptions should only be that n is an integer, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. But the formatted example added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7, which is not part of the original problem. Hmm, maybe there was a misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a different setup. Wait, maybe the user's example is incorrect, but I need to follow the instructions as given.\n\nWait, regardless of the example's correctness, the task is to read the problem, filter unrelated info, and list each assumption line by line. So for the current problem:\n\nThe problem mentions (B_s)_{s>=0} is a real standard Brownian motion starting from zero. That's one assumption. Then, the problem involves the interval [0,T], so maybe that's another condition? Or is T just a fixed positive number? The problem says \"sup_{t in [0,T]}\", so T is a fixed time horizon. So maybe the assumptions should include that T is a positive real number. But the problem didn't specify any restrictions on T; perhaps it's given as part of the problem. Wait, the problem is to show the limit as alpha approaches infinity of the supremum over t in [0,T] of that expression equals zero a.e. So, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. (B_s)_{s>=0} is a real standard Brownian motion.\n\n2. B_0 = 0.\n\nWait, since it's a standard Brownian motion starting at zero, both parts are included. But maybe standard Brownian motion already includes starting at zero. So perhaps the first assumption is that B_s is a standard Brownian motion starting from zero. But the user's example split into separate conditions. Hmm. Alternatively, since standard Brownian motion is defined to start at zero, maybe the only assumption is that B_s is a standard Brownian motion.\n\nBut to list each condition applied to one object, maybe split into:\n\n- (B_s)_{s ≥ 0} is a real standard Brownian motion.\n\n- B_0 = 0.\n\nBut actually, in the definition of standard Brownian motion, B_0 = 0 is part of the definition. So perhaps only one assumption: (B_s) is a real standard Brownian motion starting at zero.\n\nBut the example split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", which were two separate conditions, even though the original problem had \"for every integer n\" (so n is integer is the assumption, and then the problem is to prove divisibility by 91). But in the example, the user added an extra assumption, which seems incorrect. So perhaps the user's example is flawed, but I need to follow the instruction to split each assumption into separate lines for each property or condition.\n\nThus, for the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- (B_s)_{s ≥ 0} is a real standard Brownian motion.\n\n- B_0 = 0.\n\nBut these are both part of the definition of a standard Brownian motion. Alternatively, maybe just one assumption: (B_s) is a real standard Brownian motion starting from zero.\n\nBut according to the example, if the original problem mentions \"for every integer n\", then the assumption is \"n is an integer\". So here, since the problem states \"(B_s)_{s ≥ 0} is a real standard Brownian motion starting from zero\", then perhaps split into:\n\n- (B_s)_{s ≥ 0} is a real standard Brownian motion.\n\n- B_0 = 0.\n\nBut standard Brownian motion already starts at zero, so maybe the first is sufficient. However, to follow the example's approach, perhaps split into separate lines for each property. Alternatively, the user might want each condition that is given in the problem, even if redundant.\n\nAlternatively, the problem mentions \"starting from zero\", so perhaps that's an explicit part of the setup, hence an assumption. So:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- (B_s)_{s ≥ 0} is a real standard Brownian motion.\n\n- B_0 = 0.\n\nBut again, standard Brownian motion starts at zero. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem's only assumption is that B_s is a standard Brownian motion starting at zero, and that's one line. But the example had two separate lines, even if one was redundant. Wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which translates to \"n is an integer\". Then the problem's conclusion was divisibility by 91. But the user added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which is not part of the original problem. So perhaps the example is wrong. That complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended that the assumptions are all the given conditions in the problem. For the current problem, the problem states: \"How to show that [expression] =0, a.e. where (B_s)_{s≥0} is a real standard brownian motion starting from zero.\"\n\nThus, the assumptions would be:\n\n- (B_s)_{s ≥ 0} is a real standard Brownian motion.\n\n- B_0 = 0.\n\nBut perhaps these are two separate assumptions. Alternatively, since \"starting from zero\" is part of the Brownian motion's definition here, maybe it's one assumption. But to follow the example's style, perhaps split into separate lines. For example, in the example, the problem states \"for every integer n\", so assumption is \"n is an integer\". Then the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. However, the user in the example incorrectly added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which is not part of the original problem. So perhaps there was a mistake in the example, but I should focus on the current problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the only explicit assumptions are that (B_s) is a real standard Brownian motion starting at zero. Thus, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- (B_s)_{s ≥ 0} is a real standard Brownian motion starting from zero.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that $$ \\lim _{\\alpha \\rightarrow \\infty } \\sup_{t \\in \\left [0,T \\right]} \\left | e^{-\\alpha t} \\int _ 0 ^t e^{\\alpha s} ~ dB_s \\right | =0, \\ \\ \\text{a.e.} $$\n\nBut wait, does T need to be mentioned as an assumption? The problem states the supremum is over t in [0,T]. Is T a fixed positive constant? The problem doesn't specify any restrictions on T, but in the context of stochastic processes, T is usually a fixed positive real number. Since the problem doesn't state any conditions on T, perhaps it's considered given, but not an assumption. The assumptions are about the objects involved. So T is part of the problem's statement but not an assumption on the objects. So in the problem statement, T is just part of the interval over which the supremum is taken.\n\nTherefore, the only assumption is the Brownian motion's properties. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- (B_s)_{s ≥ 0} is a real standard Brownian motion starting from zero.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that $$ \\lim _{\\alpha \\rightarrow \\infty } \\sup_{t \\in [0,T]} \\left | e^{-\\alpha t} \\int _ 0 ^t e^{\\alpha s} ~ dB_s \\right | =0, \\ \\ \\text{a.e.} $$\n\nBut the original problem has \"a.e.\" which is \"almost everywhere\", so maybe that's part of the conclusion, not an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"a.e.\" is part of the problem statement, indicating that the equality holds almost everywhere. So in the problem line, it should be included.\n\nYes, in the example, the problem was stated as \"is divisible by 91\", which is the conclusion. Similarly, here, the problem is to show the limit equals zero almost everywhere. So the problem statement includes the \"a.e.\".\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be as above. The assumptions are the properties of the Brownian motion. Since the example split into two lines even if redundant, but in this case, starting from zero is part of the Brownian motion's definition, so perhaps only one assumption line.\n\nAlternatively, if the example includes \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", even though the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7, then maybe the user wants to split into separate properties. However, in the current problem, starting from zero is part of the Brownian motion's definition. Therefore, the assumption is that (B_s) is a real standard Brownian motion starting from zero. That's one line.\n\nThus, final answer:\n\nAssumption: \n- $(B_s)_{s \\geq 0}$ is a real standard Brownian motion starting from zero.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$ \\lim _{\\alpha \\rightarrow \\infty } \\sup_{t \\in [0,T]} \\left | e^{-\\alpha t} \\int _ 0 ^t e^{\\alpha s} ~ dB_s \\right | =0, \\ \\ \\text{a.e.} $$\n\nBut let me check the original problem's wording again: \"How to show that [expression] =0, a.e. where (B_s) is a real standard Brownian motion starting from zero?\" So the only assumption is the Brownian motion's properties. The time interval [0,T] is part of the problem's statement, but T isn't specified as having any particular property except being part of the interval. So the assumptions are just about B_s.",
