    "Content": "Given a subset $\\Omega$ of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ and a function $\\sigma: \\Omega \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$ , we define its derivative at $x$ to be a linear operator $\\sigma'(x)$ such that $$  \\lim_{y \\to 0} \\frac{\\|\\sigma(x + y) - \\sigma(x) - \\sigma'(x)y\\|}{\\|y\\|} = 0 $$ If this operator exists (i.e. if $\\sigma$ is differentiable at $x$ ) then how do we prove that $\\sigma'(x)$ is unique?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that the derivative of a function σ at a point x is unique. The definition given is the standard one for the Fréchet derivative in multivariable calculus. So, first, I need to recall that in single-variable calculus, the derivative is unique because if two limits exist and equal the same thing, they must be the same. But in higher dimensions, it's about linear operators satisfying a certain limit condition.\n\nThe key here is to assume that there are two such linear operators, say L and M, both satisfying the derivative condition. Then, I need to show that L and M must actually be the same operator. \n\nLet me think. The definition says that the limit of the norm of σ(x + y) - σ(x) - L(y) divided by the norm of y goes to zero as y approaches 0. Similarly for M. If both L and M satisfy this, then subtracting the two equations might help. So, consider the difference [σ(x + y) - σ(x) - L(y)] - [σ(x + y) - σ(x) - M(y)] = (M(y) - L(y)). \n\nBut how does that relate to the limit? Let's write the two conditions:\n\n1. lim_{y→0} ||σ(x + y) - σ(x) - L(y)|| / ||y|| = 0\n2. lim_{y→0} ||σ(x + y) - σ(x) - M(y)|| / ||y|| = 0\n\nIf we subtract these two expressions, maybe using the triangle inequality. Wait, actually, let's consider the difference between the two linear operators. Take the difference of the two limits. But since both limits are zero, their difference is zero. However, that might not directly lead us. Alternatively, subtract the two expressions inside the norm:\n\n||σ(x + y) - σ(x) - L(y)|| / ||y|| - ||σ(x + y) - σ(x) - M(y)|| / ||y||| ≤ || [σ(x + y) - σ(x) - L(y)] - [σ(x + y) - σ(x) - M(y)] || / ||y|| by the reverse triangle inequality. Wait, the reverse triangle inequality states that | ||a|| - ||b|| | ≤ ||a - b||. So, applying that here, we get:\n\n| ||σ(x + y) - σ(x) - L(y)|| - ||σ(x + y) - σ(x) - M(y)|| | ≤ || (σ(x + y) - σ(x) - L(y)) - (σ(x + y) - σ(x) - M(y)) || = || M(y) - L(y) ||.\n\nBut since both original norms divided by ||y|| go to zero as y→0, their difference would also go to zero. Hence, || M(y) - L(y) || / ||y|| must approach zero as y→0.\n\nTherefore, lim_{y→0} || (M - L)(y) || / ||y|| = 0. Now, since M and L are linear operators, their difference (M - L) is also a linear operator. Let's denote K = M - L. Then, K is a linear operator, and lim_{y→0} ||K(y)|| / ||y|| = 0.\n\nBut for a linear operator K, if ||K(y)|| / ||y|| approaches zero as y→0, then K must be the zero operator. Why? Because suppose K is not zero. Then there exists some vector v with ||v|| = 1 such that K(v) ≠ 0. Consider y = tv for t approaching 0. Then ||K(tv)|| / ||tv|| = ||t K(v)|| / |t| ||v|| = |t| ||K(v)|| / |t| = ||K(v)||. So the limit as t→0 would be ||K(v)||, which is a non-zero constant. But the limit is supposed to be zero. Hence, this is a contradiction, so K must be the zero operator. Therefore, M - L = 0, so M = L. Hence, the derivative is unique.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that the step where I use linearity is valid. Yes, because K is linear, K(tv) = t K(v). So scaling y by t scales K(y) linearly. Therefore, the ratio ||K(y)|| / ||y|| becomes ||K(v)|| for any non-zero y in the direction of v. If this ratio must go to zero as y→0 (i.e., t→0), but it's actually constant, then K(v) must be zero for all v. Therefore, K is the zero operator. That seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the uniqueness follows from the fact that the difference of two derivatives must be a linear operator whose norm over ||y|| tends to zero, which can only happen if the operator is zero. Hence, the derivative is unique.\n\nSo, in the problem statement, the assumptions would include that Ω is a subset of R^n, σ is a function from Ω to R^m (wait, the original problem says σ: Ω → R^n, so same dimension?), differentiable at x, and the derivative is a linear operator satisfying that limit. The problem is to prove uniqueness. The user didn't specify any additional assumptions beyond what's in the problem statement, so perhaps the key assumption is that σ is differentiable at x, i.e., such a linear operator exists. Then the problem is to show that it's unique.\n\nIn the example given by the user, they listed assumptions line by line. So here, the assumptions would be:\n\n- Ω is a subset of R^n.\n- σ is a function from Ω to R^n.\n- σ is differentiable at x (i.e., there exists a linear operator σ’(x) satisfying the given limit condition).\n\nProblem is to prove that σ’(x) is unique.\n\nBut in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but in the formatted version, the user listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. Similarly, here, the original problem states \"Given a subset Ω of R^n and a function σ: Ω→R^n, we define its derivative at x to be a linear operator σ’(x) such that... If this operator exists (i.e., if σ is differentiable at x) then prove that σ’(x) is unique.\"\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- Ω is a subset of R^n.\n- σ: Ω → R^n.\n- σ is differentiable at x (i.e., there exists a linear operator σ’(x) satisfying the limit condition).\n\nAnd the problem is to prove σ’(x) is unique.\n\nSo, the user's answer should format the problem accordingly.",
