    "AcceptedAnswer": "For example: $$f(x):=\\frac x{1+x^2}-\\arctan x\\implies f'(x)=\\frac{1-x^2}{(1+x^2)^2}-\\frac1{1+x^2}=-\\frac{2x^2}{(1+x^2)^2} $$ Since clearly $\\;f'(x)\\le 0\\;\\;\\forall\\,x\\ge0\\;$ , and in fact $\\;f'(x)<0\\;\\;\\forall\\,x>0\\;$ , the function is monotone descending, so $$\\forall\\;x>0\\;,\\;f(x)<f(0)=0\\;\\;\\text{and we're done with the leftmost inequality}$$ Now you try the rightmost inequality (very similar trick)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that for all x > 0, the inequality x/(1 + x²) < arctan(x) < x holds. Hmm, I remember that inequalities involving inverse trigonometric functions can sometimes be approached using derivatives or integration. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, they mentioned starting with 0 < arctan(x) < π/2 when x > 0. That makes sense because arctan(x) approaches π/2 as x approaches infinity. But how does that help with the inequalities given?\n\nMaybe I should consider the derivative of arctan(x). The derivative of arctan(x) is 1/(1 + x²), right? So if I can relate this derivative to the expressions in the inequalities, that might help. Let's see.\n\nFor the right part of the inequality, arctan(x) < x. Let me set up a function f(x) = x - arctan(x). If I can show that f(x) is always positive for x > 0, that would prove arctan(x) < x. Taking the derivative of f(x), f’(x) = 1 - 1/(1 + x²). Simplifying that, f’(x) = (1 + x² - 1)/(1 + x²) = x²/(1 + x²). Since x > 0, x²/(1 + x²) is always positive. That means f(x) is increasing on (0, ∞). Also, f(0) = 0 - arctan(0) = 0. Since f is increasing and f(0) = 0, then for x > 0, f(x) > 0, so arctan(x) < x. That works!\n\nNow the left inequality: x/(1 + x²) < arctan(x). Maybe I can use a similar approach. Let’s define g(x) = arctan(x) - x/(1 + x²). I need to show g(x) > 0 for x > 0. Let's compute the derivative of g(x). The derivative of arctan(x) is 1/(1 + x²), and the derivative of x/(1 + x²) is [1*(1 + x²) - x*(2x)]/(1 + x²)^2 = [1 + x² - 2x²]/(1 + x²)^2 = (1 - x²)/(1 + x²)^2. So g’(x) = 1/(1 + x²) - (1 - x²)/(1 + x²)^2. Let me combine these terms: [ (1 + x²) - (1 - x²) ] / (1 + x²)^2 = [1 + x² -1 + x²]/(1 + x²)^2 = (2x²)/(1 + x²)^2. Since x > 0, this derivative is positive. So g(x) is increasing. Now check g(0): arctan(0) - 0/(1 + 0) = 0 - 0 = 0. Since g’(x) > 0 for x > 0 and g(0) = 0, then for x > 0, g(x) > 0. Therefore, arctan(x) > x/(1 + x²). \n\nWait, but does that hold for all x > 0? Let me check at x approaching infinity. arctan(x) approaches π/2, and x/(1 + x²) approaches 0. So yes, the inequality should hold. And at x = 1, arctan(1) = π/4 ≈ 0.785, and 1/(1 + 1) = 0.5, so 0.5 < 0.785 < 1, which checks out.\n\nAnother way could be integrating the inequality. Since the derivative of arctan(t) is 1/(1 + t²), maybe integrating from 0 to x. For t > 0, if we can establish inequalities for 1/(1 + t²) and integrate them. Wait, but the given inequalities are about arctan(x) itself. Alternatively, using the series expansion of arctan(x) which is x - x³/3 + x^5/5 - ... for |x| ≤ 1. But since x can be any positive number, maybe that's not directly helpful. Though for x > 1, the series doesn't converge, but the integral approach might still work.\n\nAlternatively, considering the function h(x) = arctan(x) - x/(1 + x²). We already did that via derivatives. Seems like the derivative approach is solid here. So both inequalities can be proven by considering the functions and their derivatives, showing they are increasing/decreasing and evaluating at the endpoints.\n\nSo the assumptions here are that x is a positive real number. The problem is to prove the two-sided inequality. The original problem didn't mention any other constraints, just x > 0. The user also started by noting that arctan(x) is between 0 and π/2, which is correct, but the key is to use calculus to establish the bounds.",
