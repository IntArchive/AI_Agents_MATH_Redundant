    "Content": "Could any one tell me how to solve this one? Let $K$ be a compact subset of $\\mathbb{R}^n$, and $$A:=\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}^n:d(x,K)=1\\}.$$\nShow that $A$ has Lebesgue measure $0$. Thank you!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Suppose $x_0\\in A$. Let $B := \\{ d(x,K) < 1\\}$. Observe that since $K$ is compact, there exists $y_0\\in K$ such that $d(x_0,y_0) = 1$. By definition $B_1(y_0) = \\{x: d(x,y_0) < 1\\}$ is a subset of $B$. This implies that for all $\\epsilon < 1/2$, we have that\n$$ \\mu(B_\\epsilon(x_0) \\cap B) \\geq \\frac1{2^n} \\mu(B_\\epsilon(x_0)) $$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the Lebesgue measure. (The factor $1/2^n$ is very loose: Since a sphere tangent to $x_0$ is contained in $B$, locally an orthant centered at $x_0$ is contained in $B$.) Hence we have that for every $x_0\\in A$, \n$$ \\limsup_{\\epsilon \\to 0} \\frac{\\mu(B_\\epsilon(x_0) \\cap A)}{\\mu(B_\\epsilon(x_0))} \\leq \\frac{2^n-1}{2^n} < 1 $$ By the Lebesgue differentiation theorem, the set of $x_0\\in A$, for $A$ measurable, such that the above condition holds must be measure zero. Hence $A$ has measure zero.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The original problem is about showing that the set of points at a distance 1 from a compact set in R^n has Lebesgue measure zero. \n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions. The problem mentions K is a compact subset of R^n. Then, A is defined as the set of points where the distance to K is exactly 1. The goal is to show A has Lebesgue measure 0.\n\nSo the assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. Let's break it down. The first assumption is that K is a compact subset of R^n. That's one line. The second part is about the definition of set A, which is the set of points at distance 1 from K. But wait, the problem statement defines A, so that's part of the problem setup. Do I include that as an assumption? The example given includes the assumptions as given conditions. In the example, the user listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, even though the original problem only mentioned \"for every integer n\". So perhaps the assumptions are the given conditions in the problem, not the definitions.\n\nWait, the original problem in the example had an error in the formatted problem. The original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example is wrong? Or perhaps the user made a mistake. Wait, looking back: the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted problem under assumptions says \"n is divisible by 7\". That's conflicting. Maybe that's a mistake in the example. So perhaps the user's example is incorrect, but we have to follow their format regardless.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's example may have mistakenly added an extra assumption. However, in the current problem, the problem is to show that A (the set of points at distance 1 from K) has measure zero. The given conditions are that K is compact in R^n, and A is defined as {x: d(x,K)=1}. So the assumptions here are K is compact, K is a subset of R^n. Then the problem is to show A has Lebesgue measure 0. But how to split the assumptions. Let's look at the example again. In the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumptions are \"n is an integer\", \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like a mistake because the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7. So perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user wants us to extract assumptions as the given conditions. So in the current problem, the given conditions are K is compact, K is in R^n, and A is defined as the set of points at distance 1 from K. So the assumptions are:\n\n- K is a compact subset of ℝ^n.\n- A is defined as {x ∈ ℝ^n : d(x, K) = 1}.\n\nBut the problem is to show A has Lebesgue measure 0. So maybe the problem is as stated, with those assumptions. Wait, but in the example, they included the divisibility by 7 as an assumption even though the original problem didn't have that. That suggests that perhaps the example is wrong, but the user wants us to extract the necessary assumptions. Wait, maybe the user's example had a typo. Let me check again. Original problem in the example: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem's assumptions are \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should just be n is an integer. The fact that the problem statement requires divisibility by 91 (which is 7*13) might mean that they need to use divisibility by 7 and 13. But the user in their example added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which is not in the original problem. That seems like a mistake. So perhaps the example is incorrect. Therefore, maybe the user wants to list all given conditions as assumptions, but not introduce new ones. So in the current problem, the given conditions are K is compact in R^n, and A is the set of points at distance 1 from K. So the assumptions should be:\n\n1. K is a compact subset of ℝ^n.\n2. A is the set {x ∈ ℝ^n : d(x, K) = 1}.\n\nBut the problem is to show that A has Lebesgue measure 0. So I think that's correct. Wait, but the problem doesn't state any other conditions. So the assumptions are just those two. Therefore, the formatted problem should list those as assumptions and then the problem statement. So the answer should be:\n\nAssumption:\nK is a compact subset of ℝ^n,\nA is the set {x ∈ ℝ^n : d(x, K) = 1}.\nProblem:\nShow that A has Lebesgue measure 0.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the original problem had a general statement (for every integer n) but the formatted problem added an extra assumption (n divisible by 7). That might have been a mistake, but perhaps the user intended to have the assumptions be the conditions that the problem is under. For the current problem, the problem states that K is compact, and A is defined as such, so those are the assumptions. Therefore, the answer is as above.",
