    "Content": "Let $R$ be an associative ring with $1$. Prove that $R$ is a division ring if and only if $R$ has no proper left ideals. Clearly, if $R$ is a division ring and $I\\neq\\{0\\}$ is a left ideal, then every nonzero $z\\in I$ satisfies $1=z^{-1}z\\in I$, hence $I=R$. Now if $z\\in R$ is nonzero and $R$ has no proper left ideals, then $I:=\\{rz:r\\in R\\}$ is equal to $R$ and there exists $r\\in R$ such that $rz=1$. However, we still need to prove $zr=1$. How can we do this? Thank you.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "$(rz)r=r(zr)=r$, thus $r(1-zr)=0$, $zr=1$. Remark that the fact that $zr=1$ follow from the fact that $R$ does not have divisors of zero: if $ab=0$ $a,b\\neq 0$ , since $Ra=R$, $ra=1$, $r(ab)=(ra)b=b=0$. Contradiction.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement from the original question.\n\nThe original question is about proving that a ring R is a division ring if and only if it has no proper left ideals. The user has provided some initial thoughts but is stuck on showing that zr=1 once they have found r such that rz=1. \n\nTo structure this according to the example given, I need to list all assumptions line by line. The problem involves an associative ring with 1, so that's one assumption. The two directions of the equivalence: one is assuming R is a division ring and showing no proper left ideals, the other is assuming no proper left ideals and proving R is a division ring. However, in the format, assumptions are conditions applied to one object. The problem is to prove the equivalence. \n\nWait, the example given had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in this problem, the main assumptions are that R is an associative ring with 1, and in each direction of the proof, different conditions are applied. However, the problem is to prove an equivalence: division ring iff no proper left ideals. \n\nSo, the assumptions here would be that R is an associative ring with 1. Then, the problem is to show that R is a division ring if and only if it has no proper left ideals. \n\nBut in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer, but the formatted problem listed two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the user had to prove divisibility by 91, which is 7*13, and perhaps the example added the divisibility by 7 as an assumption? Wait no, the original example problem was to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. Then the formatted problem listed assumptions as n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect? Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: \nn is an integer,\nn is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Because 91 is 7*13, maybe the problem actually requires that n is divisible by both 7 and 13? But the original problem says \"for every integer n\". So perhaps the example has a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a typo, but the user restructured it with an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Hmm, that might be an error in the example. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instruction for the current problem.\n\nBack to the current problem. The user's question is to structure the problem as per the example. So the task is to extract assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nOriginal problem: Let R be an associative ring with 1. Prove that R is a division ring if and only if R has no proper left ideals.\n\nSo the assumptions here are:\n\n1. R is an associative ring.\n2. R has a multiplicative identity (1).\n3. The problem is to prove equivalence between R being a division ring and R having no proper left ideals.\n\nBut the example had two assumptions: n is an integer and n divisible by 7, even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n\". So perhaps in the example, they split the conditions into separate lines, even if some are part of the problem's premise.\n\nIn this case, the original problem states that R is an associative ring with 1. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- R is an associative ring.\n- R has a multiplicative identity (1).\n\nThen the problem is to prove that R is a division ring if and only if R has no proper left ideals.\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem's assumption was \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So perhaps the user intended to split all the conditions given in the problem into separate assumptions, even if some are part of the problem's premise.\n\nIn the current problem, the problem states \"Let R be an associative ring with 1. Prove that R is a division ring if and only if R has no proper left ideals.\" So the assumptions are:\n\n1. R is an associative ring.\n2. R has a multiplicative identity (1).\n\nThen the problem is to prove the equivalence. But in the example, the problem's original statement had \"for every integer n\", which was split into \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, even though it's part of the universal quantifier. So perhaps in this case, the assumptions are the properties of R given in the problem statement.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nR is an associative ring,\nR has a multiplicative identity.\n\nProblem: Prove that R is a division ring if and only if R has no proper left ideals.\n\nBut the user's example added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, the original problem in the example was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91, but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the example? Because if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", then the assumption should just be that n is an integer, not that n is divisible by 7. Unless the problem was mistyped. For example, maybe the original problem was to prove that if n is divisible by 7, then A(n) is divisible by 91. Then the formatted problem would have assumptions n is an integer and n divisible by 7. But the user's example shows the original problem as \"for every integer n\", but formatted with n divisible by 7. That seems inconsistent. Perhaps it's a mistake in the example. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instruction for the current problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question starts with \"Let R be an associative ring with 1. Prove that R is a division ring if and only if R has no proper left ideals.\" So the assumptions are R is associative, has 1. The problem is to prove the equivalence. Therefore, following the example's structure, the assumptions would be:\n\n- R is an associative ring,\n- R has a multiplicative identity.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that R is a division ring if and only if R has no proper left ideals.\n\nBut the user's example included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, maybe in the example, the original problem had a hidden assumption. For instance, the original problem might have required n to be divisible by 7, but the user wrote \"for every integer n\". If that's a mistake, then the formatted problem corrects it by adding the assumption. But in the current case, the problem is correctly stated. So I think the correct approach is to list the assumptions given in the problem statement, each on a separate line.\n\nSo for the current problem:\n\nAssumption:\nR is an associative ring,\nR has a multiplicative identity.\n\nProblem:\nProve that R is a division ring if and only if R has no proper left ideals.\n\nBut the original question's problem statement already includes \"Let R be an associative ring with 1\", so those are the assumptions. Then the problem is the equivalence. Therefore, this should be the formatted version.",
