    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants to prove that sin²(x) + cos²(x) = 1 using the power series definitions of sine and cosine. Normally, we learn this identity from the unit circle or Pythagorean theorem, but here they need to use the series expansions directly.\n\nFirst, I remember that the power series for sin(x) and cos(x) are:\n\nsin(x) = Σ [(-1)^k x^(2k+1) / (2k+1)!] from k=0 to ∞\n\ncos(x) = Σ [(-1)^k x^(2k) / (2k)!] from k=0 to ∞\n\nSo, to find sin²(x) and cos²(x), I need to square each of these series and then add them together. But squaring a power series can get complicated because it involves multiplying two infinite series, which results in a Cauchy product. That might be why the user is getting a messy result.\n\nLet me recall how to multiply two power series. For two series Σa_n and Σb_n, their product is Σc_n where c_n = Σa_k b_{n-k} from k=0 to n. So, applying this to sin²(x) and cos²(x):\n\nFor sin²(x), the Cauchy product would be:\n\n[Σ (-1)^k x^(2k+1)/(2k+1)!]^2 = Σ [Σ (-1)^k (-1)^{m} x^{2k+1 + 2m+1} / ((2k+1)! (2m+1)!))] for k, m from 0 to ∞.\n\nSimilarly for cos²(x):\n\n[Σ (-1)^k x^(2k)/(2k)!]^2 = Σ [Σ (-1)^k (-1)^m x^{2k + 2m} / ((2k)! (2m)!))].\n\nThen, adding these two results together, we need to show that all the coefficients except the constant term cancel out, leaving 1.\n\nWait, but the original identity is sin² + cos² = 1, which is a constant function. So when expressed as a power series, all the coefficients for x^n where n ≥ 1 should be zero, and the constant term should be 1.\n\nTherefore, the strategy is to compute the coefficients of x^n in sin²(x) + cos²(x) and show they are 0 for n ≥ 1 and 1 for n=0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way than computing the Cauchy product directly. For example, using the known power series of 1, which is just 1, and then showing that the difference 1 - sin²(x) - cos²(x) has all coefficients zero.\n\nBut maybe another approach is to differentiate sin²(x) + cos²(x) and show that the derivative is zero, implying it's a constant, then evaluate at x=0 to show the constant is 1. However, the problem specifies using the power series, so differentiation might not be the intended method.\n\nAlternatively, consider using the power series of cos(2x) or other identities, but again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, recall that the derivative of sin(x) is cos(x) and the derivative of cos(x) is -sin(x). But again, this might not directly help with the power series approach.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Since we know that the derivative of sin(x) is cos(x), and the derivative of cos(x) is -sin(x), maybe we can use the Cauchy product to compute the derivative of sin²(x) + cos²(x) and show it's zero.\n\nBut let's try the direct approach. Let's compute sin²(x) + cos²(x) using the power series.\n\nFirst, write out the terms for sin(x) and cos(x):\n\nsin(x) = x - x³/3! + x⁵/5! - x⁷/7! + ...\n\ncos(x) = 1 - x²/2! + x⁴/4! - x⁶/6! + ...\n\nSquaring sin(x):\n\nsin²(x) = (x - x³/6 + x⁵/120 - ...)^2\n\n= x² - 2x⁴/(6) + (2x⁶)/(6*120) + ... Hmm, but this seems messy. Let's think in terms of general terms.\n\nAlternatively, consider using the identity that sin²(x) = (1 - cos(2x))/2 and cos²(x) = (1 + cos(2x))/2. Then adding them gives 1. But this uses trigonometric identities, which might not be allowed since the problem requires using the power series directly.\n\nAnother thought: the power series for sin and cos satisfy the differential equation y'' + y = 0. But again, maybe that's not helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, consider multiplying the power series of sin(x) and cos(x) by themselves and adding. Let's attempt to compute the coefficients.\n\nFor sin²(x):\n\nThe coefficient of x^n in sin²(x) is the sum over k from 0 to n of [coefficient of x^k in sin(x)] * [coefficient of x^{n - k} in sin(x)].\n\nBut since sin(x) has only odd powers, x^(2m+1), then in order for k and n - k to both be odd, their sum n must be even. Wait, no. If we have two odd exponents: (2k + 1) + (2m + 1) = 2(k + m + 1), which is even. So sin²(x) has only even exponents. Similarly, cos²(x) also has even exponents. So when we add sin²(x) + cos²(x), the result will have even exponents, and we need to show that all coefficients except x^0 are zero.\n\nSimilarly, the constant term (x^0) in sin²(x) is zero, since sin(x) starts at x^1. The constant term in cos²(x) is (1)^2 = 1. So the sum's constant term is 1. Then we need to show that all coefficients for x^{2k} where k ≥ 1 are zero.\n\nSo let's check the coefficient of x^2 in sin²(x) + cos²(x).\n\nFirst, in sin²(x), the x^2 term comes from multiplying x (from the first sin) and x (from the second sin). The coefficient is 1*1 = 1. But wait, in the Cauchy product, for x^2 in sin²(x), we have to consider the product of the x term and the x term. So that's 1*1 = 1. Then, any other combinations? Since sin(x) is x - x^3/6 + ..., the next term is x^3. But x^3 * x^{-1} doesn't exist, so no. So the coefficient of x^2 in sin²(x) is 1*1 = 1.\n\nIn cos²(x), the x^2 term comes from two contributions: multiplying the constant term 1 with the x^2 term of cos(x), and the x^2 term with the constant term. The x^2 term in cos(x) is (-1)^1 x^2 / 2! = -x²/2. So in the square, the coefficient is 1*(-1/2) + (-1/2)*1 + (other terms?), but wait, the Cauchy product for x^2 in cos²(x) is sum_{k + m = 2} [ (-1)^k / (2k)! ) * (-1)^m / (2m)! ) ].\n\nWait, let's compute the coefficient of x^2 in cos²(x):\n\ncos(x) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k x^{2k}/(2k)!.\n\nSo cos²(x) = Σ_{n=0}^∞ [ Σ_{k=0}^n (-1)^k / (2k)! * (-1)^{n - k} / (2(n - k))! ) ] x^{2n}.\n\nWait, but the exponent when squaring cos(x) would be x^{2k} * x^{2m} = x^{2(k + m)}. So the coefficient for x^{2n} is Σ_{k=0}^n [ (-1)^k / (2k)! * (-1)^{n - k} / (2(n - k))! ) ].\n\nBut in the original problem, when adding sin²(x) + cos²(x), the exponents are all even. Let's consider n=1 for x².\n\nCoefficient in sin²(x) for x²: since sin(x) = x - x^3/6 + ..., then sin²(x) has x² term from x * x = x². So coefficient is 1*1 = 1.\n\nCoefficient in cos²(x) for x²: cos(x) = 1 - x²/2 + ..., so cos²(x) = (1 - x²/2 + ...)(1 - x²/2 + ...). The x² term comes from 1*(-x²/2) + (-x²/2)*1 + higher terms, which gives -x²/2 - x²/2 = -x². So coefficient is -1.\n\nTherefore, total coefficient for x² in sin² + cos² is 1 (from sin²) + (-1) (from cos²) = 0.\n\nOkay, that works. Now check x^4 term.\n\nIn sin²(x), the x^4 term comes from:\n\n- x * x^3 term: x*( -x^3/6 ) = -x^4/6\n\n- x^3 term * x: (-x^3/6)*x = -x^4/6\n\n- x^2 term? But there is no x^2 term in sin(x). Wait, sin(x) is x - x^3/6 + x^5/120 - ..., so when squaring, the x^4 term comes from x * x^3 and x^3 * x, each term contributing (-1/6)x^4, so total for sin²(x) x^4 term is (-1/6 -1/6) = -1/3.\n\nAdditionally, in the Cauchy product, there's also the product of the x^5 term with x^{-1} term, but that doesn't exist. So the x^4 term in sin²(x) is -1/3.\n\nNow, in cos²(x), the x^4 term:\n\ncos(x) = 1 - x²/2 + x^4/24 - ...\n\nSo cos²(x) = (1 - x²/2 + x^4/24 - ...)^2.\n\nThe x^4 term comes from:\n\n1*(x^4/24) + (x^4/24)*1 + (-x²/2)*(-x²/2) + ... Wait, expanding:\n\nThe terms contributing to x^4 are:\n\n1 * x^4/24,\n\nx^4/24 * 1,\n\n(-x²/2) * (-x²/2),\n\nand any other products where exponents add to 4.\n\nSo the coefficients are:\n\n(1 * 1/24) + (1/24 * 1) + ( (-1/2) * (-1/2) ) = 1/24 + 1/24 + 1/4 = (2/24) + 6/24 = 8/24 = 1/3.\n\nBut note that each term in the Cauchy product is multiplied by the coefficients. Wait, actually, in the Cauchy product for cos²(x), the coefficient of x^4 is:\n\nΣ_{k=0}^2 [ (-1)^k / (2k)! * (-1)^{2 - k} / (2(2 - k))! ) ]\n\nWait, n=2 for x^{4} (since each term in cos is x^{2k}, so when squared, x^{4} corresponds to n=2 in the sum).\n\nSo for k=0: (-1)^0 / 0! * (-1)^2 / 4! = 1 * 1 / 24 = 1/24\n\nk=1: (-1)^1 / 2! * (-1)^1 / 2! = ( -1 / 2 ) * ( -1 / 2 ) = 1/4\n\nk=2: (-1)^2 / 4! * (-1)^0 / 0! = 1/24 * 1 = 1/24\n\nSumming these: 1/24 + 1/4 + 1/24 = (1 + 6 + 1)/24 = 8/24 = 1/3.\n\nSo coefficient of x^4 in cos²(x) is 1/3.\n\nThen coefficient of x^4 in sin²(x) + cos²(x) is (-1/3) + (1/3) = 0.\n\nSimilarly, for higher terms, this pattern continues. So it seems that for each even power of x, the coefficients from sin² and cos² cancel each other, leaving only the constant term 1.\n\nTherefore, by induction or by recognizing this pattern, we can conclude that all coefficients for x^n with n ≥ 2 (even n) cancel out, resulting in sin²(x) + cos²(x) = 1.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to use the generating functions and properties of power series. Since we know that the derivative of sin is cos and derivative of cos is -sin, we can use that to find the derivative of sin² + cos² and show it's zero, hence constant. Then evaluate at x=0 to get 1. But the problem specifically asks to use the power series, not derivatives.\n\nTherefore, the key steps are:\n\n1. Express sin²(x) and cos²(x) as Cauchy products of their power series.\n\n2. Compute the coefficients for each even power of x in sin²(x) and cos²(x).\n\n3. Show that for each even power greater than 0, the coefficients from sin² and cos² sum to zero.\n\n4. Conclude that the sum is 1.",
