    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. The example provided shows that assumptions should list each condition or property applied to one object, and then the problem statement.\n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The title is \"Closed form for a sum involving Gamma functions, factorials, and other special functions.\" The problem is asking for a proof of a specific closed-form expression for an infinite series. The series is given as:\n\n$$\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\frac{\\Gamma\\left(n+\\tfrac14\\right)}{2^n\\,(4n+1)^2\\,n!}$$\n\nAnd the conjectured closed form involves several special functions like the Catalan constant, dilogarithm, trigamma function, etc.\n\nNow, applying the format. The \"Assumption\" section needs to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. However, looking at the problem, it's a summation from n=0 to infinity. The series involves Gamma functions, factorials, and constants. The problem is to prove the equality, so the assumptions here would be about the convergence of the series, perhaps the domain of the variables involved. But in the problem statement as given, there are no explicit variables except n, which is the summation index. The Gamma function here is evaluated at n + 1/4, which is valid for n being a non-negative integer (since n starts at 0). The denominator has 2^n, (4n+1)^2, and n!. All these terms are defined for non-negative integers n, so the terms of the series are well-defined for all n ≥ 0. \n\nBut in the example provided earlier, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, in the current problem, the series is over integers n starting from 0, so perhaps the assumption is that n is a non-negative integer. Also, the convergence of the series might be an implicit assumption. However, the problem is to find a closed form, so maybe the convergence is already assured given the structure of the terms. The user might be assuming that the series converges, which is necessary for the sum to exist.\n\nAnother point: the Gamma function Γ(n + 1/4) is defined for n + 1/4 > 0, which is true for all n ≥ 0 since 1/4 is positive. So each term is well-defined. The denominator terms 2^n, (4n+1)^2, n! are all positive and non-zero, so each term is valid.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is a non-negative integer (since the sum starts at n=0 and goes to infinity, n is an integer ≥ 0)\n- The series converges (since otherwise the sum wouldn't make sense)\n- The functions involved (Gamma, factorial, etc.) are defined at their respective arguments.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address only one property applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a non-negative integer,\nΓ is the gamma function,\nLi₂ is the dilogarithm function,\nψ⁽¹⁾ is the trigamma function,\nG is the Catalan constant.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7. The current problem's assumptions might include that n is a non-negative integer (since the sum is over n starting at 0), and the definitions of the special functions involved. However, the problem statement already includes the definitions of G, Li₂, and ψ⁽¹⁾ in the description. But the user wants the assumptions listed as part of the formatted problem. So maybe the assumptions are that the reader knows the definitions of these functions. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes the series converges, and that n is a non-negative integer.\n\nBut in the original problem statement, the user didn't specify any particular conditions or assumptions beyond the series definition. However, for the problem to make sense, certain conditions must hold. So the key assumptions are:\n\n1. The summation index n ranges over all non-negative integers (n = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n2. The gamma function Γ(n + 1/4) is defined for all terms in the series (which is true since n ≥ 0 implies n + 1/4 > 0).\n3. The series converges to the given closed-form expression.\n\nBut the problem is to prove the equality, so the convergence is part of what needs to be established. However, the user presents the equality as a conjecture confirmed numerically, so perhaps the assumption is that the series converges.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond the definitions of the functions involved. But according to the example, the assumptions are about the problem's conditions. In the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the original problem doesn't state any such conditions except the structure of the sum. So perhaps the only assumption is that n is a non-negative integer in the summation. But in the problem statement, n is the index of summation, so it's automatically a non-negative integer. Therefore, maybe there are no additional assumptions needed beyond the problem statement's components. However, the example included assumptions even when they were part of the problem's premise. Wait, the original example had \"Prove that for every integer n...\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption listed n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the user said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal example problem:\n\"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\"\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems incorrect. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the original problem was different. Wait, perhaps the original example was a different problem where divisibility by 7 was part of the assumption. Maybe the user made an error in the example. But regardless, the task is to follow the format given in the example.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's example shows that even if the original problem states \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, and the problem becomes to prove divisibility by 91. So perhaps the example is incorrect, but the instruction is to follow it. However, the user might have intended that the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. Wait, perhaps the original example had a typo, and the actual problem required n to be divisible by 7, hence the assumptions.\n\nIn the current problem, there are no explicit conditions given in the problem statement beyond the sum itself. However, the problem is to prove that the sum equals the given expression. Therefore, the assumptions would include the definitions of the special functions mentioned (Catalan constant, dilogarithm, trigamma), and perhaps the convergence of the series. But the example didn't list definitions as assumptions, rather it listed conditions on variables. So perhaps the key assumptions here are:\n\n- The series converges.\n- n is a non-negative integer (as the summation index).\n\nBut since the summation is from n=0 to infinity, the index n is by definition a non-negative integer. So perhaps that's inherent and doesn't need to be listed. However, the example listed \"n is an integer\" even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So maybe in this case, we should list \"n is a non-negative integer\" as an assumption.\n\nBut the problem is to prove an equality for the sum, so perhaps the main assumption is the convergence of the series. But convergence is part of what needs to be proven when establishing the closed form. However, the user presents the equality as a conjecture supported by numerical evidence, so maybe they assume convergence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no explicit assumptions, and the problem is just as stated. But the format requires listing assumptions. Given the example, even if the original problem didn't state certain conditions, the formatted problem includes them. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That suggests that perhaps the user made a mistake in the example, but regardless, we need to follow the format.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the example, the original problem actually had n divisible by 7, but the user wrote it incorrectly. Without seeing the original example's source, it's hard to tell. But given the instructions, perhaps the task is to extract assumptions from the problem statement.\n\nIn the current problem, the series is from n=0 to infinity, so n is a non-negative integer. The functions involved (Gamma, factorial) are defined for those values. The special functions (Catalan G, dilogarithm, trigamma) are known. So possible assumptions:\n\n- n is a non-negative integer.\n- The Gamma function is defined for arguments n + 1/4.\n- The series converges.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should be a single property applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a non-negative integer,\nΓ(n + 1/4) is defined for all terms in the series,\nLi₂(x) denotes the dilogarithm function,\nψ⁽¹⁾(x) denotes the trigamma function,\nG denotes the Catalan constant.\n\nBut the problem statement already defines G, Li₂, and ψ⁽¹⁾ in the text. However, the formatted problem should list assumptions, which might include the definitions of these functions as they are special functions. But the example didn't include such definitions. The example's assumptions were about the variable n. So perhaps here, the main assumption is that n is a non-negative integer. The Gamma function being defined is inherent since n + 1/4 > 0 for n ≥ 0. But maybe that's an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have no explicit assumptions beyond what's in the sum. However, following the example, which took the original problem's conditions (like n being an integer) and possibly added another (n divisible by 7), perhaps here we need to list n being a non-negative integer as an assumption.\n\nSo, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a non-negative integer,\nThe series converges.\n\nProblem:\nProve that\n$$\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\frac{\\Gamma\\left(n+\\tfrac14\\right)}{2^n\\,(4n+1)^2\\,n!}$$\nequals the given expression involving Catalan constant, dilogarithm, trigamma, etc.\n\nBut the example's assumptions listed properties of the variable in the problem. Here, the summation index n is a non-negative integer, so that's an assumption. The convergence is also an assumption, but perhaps the problem is to prove both convergence and the closed form. However, the problem as stated in the original question is to prove the equality, implying that the convergence is part of what needs to be proven. Therefore, maybe the assumption is just that n is a non-negative integer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are no assumptions needed beyond the problem's structure. But the format requires listing assumptions. Given that, and following the example where even obvious conditions were listed (like n being an integer), I think the correct approach here is to list:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a non-negative integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the sum equals the given closed-form expression.\n\nBecause in the example, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", the formatted assumption listed \"n is an integer\", which is redundant but part of the format. So here, the assumption is that n is a non-negative integer as the summation index.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a non-negative integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that\n$$\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\frac{\\Gamma\\!\\left(n+\\tfrac14\\right)}{2^n\\,(4n+1)^2\\,n!}$$\nequals\n$$\\frac{\\Gamma\\!\\left(\\tfrac14\\right)\\sqrt[4]2}{192}\\left[6\\sqrt{2}\\left(2\\pi\\ln2-\\ln^22-8\\operatorname{Li}_2\\left(\\tfrac1{\\sqrt2}\\right)\\right)+3\\psi^{(1)}\\!\\left(\\tfrac18\\right)-48G+\\left(7\\sqrt2-6\\right)\\pi^2\\right].$$\n\nBut the original problem mentions \"Could you suggest any ideas how to prove it?\" So the problem is to prove the equality. The assumptions are inherent in the summation index n being non-negative integers. Therefore, the final answer should list that n is a non-negative integer as the assumption.",
