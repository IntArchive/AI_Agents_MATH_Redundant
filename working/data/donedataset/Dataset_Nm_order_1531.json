    "Content": "While reading wikipedia article on Exponential distribution , I found the statement on scaling the random variable. Let $Exp(\\lambda)$ be the distribution of the exponential random variable with paramter $\\lambda > 0$ whose probability density function is $\\lambda e^{-\\lambda x}$ for $x\\geq 0$. The family of exponential distribution is closed under scaling by a positive factor; that is, if $X \\sim Exp(\\lambda)$ then $kX \\sim Exp(\\lambda/k)$ for $k>0$. How can I prove it?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "We give two solutions. The first is a formal calculation. The second is informal, but more informative. Formal verification: Let $X$ have exponential distribution with parameter $\\lambda$. Let $k$ be a positive constant, and let $Y=kX$. The cumulative distribution function $F_Y(y)$ of $Y$, for $y \\ge 0$, is given by \n$$F_Y(y)=P(Y \\le y)=P(X \\le y/k)=F_X(y/k),$$\nwhere $F_X$ is the cumulative distribution function of $X$. Now there are several ways to find the density function $f_Y(y)$ of $Y$: (i) We could find $F_X(x)$ by integrating, substitute $y/k$ for $x$, and differentiate with respect to $y$; (ii) We could look up $F_X(x)$ and then proceed as in (i); (iii) Or else we can use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.\nLet $x=y/k$. By the Chain Rule,\n$$\\frac{dF_X(y/k)}{dy}=\\frac{dx}{dy}\\frac{dF_X(x)}{dx}=\\frac{1}{k}f_X(x)=\\frac{1}{k}\\lambda e^{-\\lambda x}=\\frac{\\lambda}{k}e^{-\\lambda y/k}=\\lambda'e^{-\\lambda' y},$$\nwhere $\\lambda'=\\lambda/k$. That is what we wanted to show. Note: The approach (iii) is in general the easiest, so that's what we  used.  It may look more difficult than approach (i), but that's because $\\lambda e^{-\\lambda x}$ is exceptionally easy to integrate. If we are working with the normal instead of the exponential, we can't even start on (i), while (iii) goes through just as easily as for the exponential. Informal justification: The random variable $X$ might describe the lifetime, in days , of an atom of a certain radioactive substance $S$.  Recall that the mean lifetime is $1/\\lambda$. On Planet $K$ far far away, the length of the day is one-third the length of an Earth day. So, on Planet $K$, and measuring time in $K$-days, substance $S$ will have mean lifetime $3/\\lambda$ $K$-days. It follows that the lifetime $Y$ of an atom of substance $S$, as measured in $K$-days, has exponential distribution with parameter $\\lambda/3$. Similarly, if the length of the day on Planet $K$ is $1/k$ times an Earth day, \nthen on Planet $K$, measuring time in $K$-days, substance $S$ has mean lifetime $k/\\lambda$. So the lifetime $Y$ of an atom of $S$, measured in $K$-days, has exponential distribution with parameter $\\lambda/k$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement from the original question.\n\nThe original question is about proving that the family of exponential distributions is closed under scaling. The user mentions that if X follows an exponential distribution with parameter λ, then scaling X by a positive factor k results in a distribution Exp(λ/k). \n\nLet me parse the information. The assumptions here are:\n\n1. X is an exponential random variable with parameter λ, which is greater than 0. So, X ∼ Exp(λ).\n2. The probability density function (pdf) of X is given as λe^(-λx) for x ≥ 0.\n3. The scaling factor k is a positive constant, i.e., k > 0.\n4. The task is to show that kX follows an exponential distribution with parameter λ/k.\n\nWait, the original problem statement says \"closed under scaling by a positive factor,\" so the key points are the scaling and the resulting distribution. The assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. For example, X is defined with Exp(λ), the pdf of X, k being positive, and then the transformation kX. But in the example provided by the user, the assumptions were about n being an integer and n being divisible by 7. Each assumption is a single condition on one object.\n\nSo applying that here:\n\nAssumptions:\n- X follows an exponential distribution with parameter λ (X ∼ Exp(λ)).\n- The parameter λ is positive (λ > 0).\n- The probability density function of X is λe^{-λx} for x ≥ 0.\n- k is a positive real number (k > 0).\n- The random variable kX is defined by scaling X by k.\n\nWait, but maybe some of these can be combined. However, according to the example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So, breaking down:\n\n1. X is an exponential random variable with parameter λ. (This is one assumption about X.)\n2. The parameter λ is positive. (Another assumption about λ.)\n3. The probability density function of X is λe^{-λx} for x ≥ 0. (This defines the pdf, so it's another condition on X.)\n4. k is a positive real number. (Assumption about k.)\n5. The random variable Y = kX is defined by scaling X by k. (This is the transformation applied.)\n\nBut wait, maybe the problem statement itself is to show that Y = kX has distribution Exp(λ/k). So the problem is to prove that under these assumptions, Y follows Exp(λ/k).\n\nIn the example given, the problem was structured as listing the assumptions line by line, each being a single condition. So here, the key elements are:\n\nAssumption: X ∼ Exp(λ)\nAssumption: λ > 0\nAssumption: The pdf of X is λe^{-λx} for x ≥ 0\nAssumption: k > 0\nProblem: Prove that kX ∼ Exp(λ/k)\n\nBut maybe some of these can be considered part of the definition. For instance, the pdf is part of the definition of X ∼ Exp(λ). However, in the example, the user included the expression for A(n) as part of the problem statement. So perhaps the pdf here is part of the problem's given information.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- X ∼ Exp(λ)\n- λ > 0\n- k > 0\n- The pdf of X is λe^{-λx} for x ≥ 0\n\nBut the problem is to prove that kX ∼ Exp(λ/k). Wait, the original question's problem is \"How can I prove it?\" referring to the statement that kX ∼ Exp(λ/k). So structuring that, the problem would be \"Prove that if X ∼ Exp(λ) then kX ∼ Exp(λ/k) for k > 0.\"\n\nBut the user's example had the problem as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91,\" with the assumptions including n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So in this case, the problem is the main statement to prove, and the assumptions are the conditions given.\n\nIn the current problem, the original problem states that the family is closed under scaling, i.e., if X ∼ Exp(λ) then kX ∼ Exp(λ/k). So the assumptions are the conditions under which this holds. The conditions are:\n\n1. X is an exponential random variable with parameter λ (X ∼ Exp(λ)).\n2. λ is a positive real number (λ > 0).\n3. k is a positive real number (k > 0).\n4. The pdf of X is λe^{-λx} for x ≥ 0.\n\nBut perhaps the pdf is part of the definition, so maybe it's redundant. However, in the example, the user included the expression for A(n) in the problem statement. So maybe in this case, the problem statement would include the definition of Exp(λ), but according to the user's example, the problem statement includes the expression to be proved. So perhaps the problem here is to prove that kX ∼ Exp(λ/k) given that X has the specified pdf.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is as stated in the title: \"Is the family of exponential distributions closed under scaling?\" But the user's instruction is to structure the problem as per the example, which for the example had the problem statement as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91,\" with assumptions about n.\n\nSo applying that here:\n\nAssumptions:\n- X is an exponential random variable with parameter λ.\n- λ > 0.\n- k is a positive real number (k > 0).\n- The probability density function of X is λe^{-λx} for x ≥ 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that kX follows an exponential distribution with parameter λ/k (i.e., kX ∼ Exp(λ/k)).\n\nBut perhaps some of these assumptions can be merged. However, the example has each assumption on a separate line, each addressing one property. So:\n\nAssumption: X follows an exponential distribution with parameter λ (X ∼ Exp(λ)).\nAssumption: The parameter λ is positive (λ > 0).\nAssumption: The probability density function of X is λe^{-λx} for x ≥ 0.\nAssumption: k is a positive real number (k > 0).\nProblem: Prove that kX follows an exponential distribution with parameter λ/k (kX ∼ Exp(λ/k)).\n\nBut maybe the third assumption about the pdf is part of the definition of Exp(λ), so perhaps it's redundant if we have X ∼ Exp(λ). However, in the example, the user included the expression for A(n) in the problem statement, which is similar to including the pdf here. Therefore, to be precise, the pdf should be listed as an assumption.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: X follows an exponential distribution with parameter λ (X ∼ Exp(λ)),\nAssumption: λ is a positive real number (λ > 0),\nAssumption: The probability density function of X is λe^{-λx} for x ≥ 0,\nAssumption: k is a positive real number (k > 0),\nProblem: Prove that kX follows an exponential distribution with parameter λ/k (kX ∼ Exp(λ/k)).\n###END_OF_FORMAT###\n\nI need to check if this matches the user's example structure. The example had two assumptions (n is an integer, n divisible by 7) and the problem statement. Here, each assumption is a separate line, each addressing one condition. So yes, this seems correct.",
