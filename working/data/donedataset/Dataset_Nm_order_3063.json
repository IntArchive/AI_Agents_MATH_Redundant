    "Content": "There is numerical evidence that $$\\int_0^\\pi\\arcsin\\left(\\frac14\\sqrt{8-2\\sqrt{10-2\\sqrt{17-8\\cos x}}}\\right)dx=\\frac{\\pi^2}{5}.$$ How can this be proved? Context In another question , three random points on a circle are chosen, and tangents to the circle at those points form a triangle, with side lengths $d,e,f$ . The relevant question here is to prove that $P(de<f^2)=\\frac35$ . Assuming the radius is $1$ , we have $d=\\tan X-\\tan(X+Y)$ $e=\\tan Y-\\tan(X+Y)$ $f=\\tan X+\\tan Y$ $P(de<f^2)=P((\\tan X-\\tan(X+Y))(\\tan Y-\\tan(X+Y))<(\\tan X+\\tan Y)^2)$ I rotated the graph $45^\\circ$ by letting $X=y-x$ and $Y=y+x$ . Then Wolfram gave me $y$ as a function of $x$ . After some minor simplifications, I ended up with the integral in this question. My attempt Approachzero does not turn up anything similar. Wolfram does not evaluate the anti-derivative. Here is the graph of $y=\\arcsin\\left(\\frac14\\sqrt{8-2\\sqrt{10-2\\sqrt{17-8\\cos x}}}\\right)$ . I tried applying some general advice about related integrals, but I suspect this one may be out of my league.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Applying $\\arcsin  x=\\frac12\\arccos(1-2x^2)$ followed by $\\arccos x=\\frac12\\arccos(2x^2-1)$ yields: $$ \\arcsin\\left(\\frac14\\sqrt{8-2\\sqrt{10-2\\sqrt{17-8\\cos x}}}\\right)=\\frac14\\arccos\\left(\\frac14-\\frac14\\sqrt{17-8\\cos x}\\right)=\\frac14f(x)$$ Based on the graph from below, we can rewrite the red part, $\\int_0^\\pi f(x)dx$ , as the total square area $(\\pi^2)$ minus the blue part: $\\int_{2\\pi/3}^\\pi f^{-1}(y)dy$ , where $f^{-1}(y)=\\arccos\\left(2\\sin^2y+\\cos y\\right)$ . $$\\Rightarrow \\frac14\\int_0^\\pi \\arccos\\left(\\frac14-\\frac14\\sqrt{17-8\\cos x}\\right)dx=\\frac{\\pi^2}{4}-\\frac14\\int_\\frac{2\\pi}{3}^\\pi\\arccos\\left(2\\sin^2y+\\cos y\\right)dy$$ $$\\overset{y\\to \\pi-y}=\\frac{\\pi^2}{4}-\\frac14\\int_0^\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\arccos\\left(2\\sin^2y-\\cos y\\right)dy=\\frac{\\pi^2}{4}-\\frac{\\pi^2}{20}=\\frac{\\pi^2}{5}$$ The last integral can be found here .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the core problem.\n\nLooking at the original question, the user is asking to prove that a specific integral equals π²/5. The integral is from 0 to π of the arcsine of a complicated square root expression. The context provided talks about probability involving points on a circle and tangents forming a triangle, but the actual problem is just the integral. \n\nSo, the assumptions here would be related to the integral's limits and the function inside the integral. The integral is from 0 to π, and the integrand is arcsin of that expression. The problem is to prove the integral equals π²/5. The context mentions variables X and Y related to angles on a circle and some probability, but those might be part of the context leading to the integral, not assumptions for the problem itself. The key is to filter out unrelated info.\n\nThe example given in the user's instruction had assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Similarly, here, the integral's bounds and the function's form are the main assumptions. The problem is to prove the integral equals π²/5. The rest about the probability problem and variable substitutions is context but not part of the problem's assumptions. So, the assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. The integrand is fixed, so maybe the assumption is the integrand as given, and the limits from 0 to π. But in the example, they listed assumptions about the variable, so here maybe:\n\nAssumption: The integral is from 0 to π.\nAssumption: The integrand is arcsin[(1/4)√(8 - 2√(10 - 2√(17 - 8 cos x)))].\n\nBut wait, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So splitting them:\n\nAssumption: The lower limit of integration is 0.\nAssumption: The upper limit of integration is π.\nAssumption: The integrand is arcsin[(1/4)√(8 - 2√(10 - 2√(17 - 8 cos x})))].\n\nBut maybe the first two can be combined as the integral is over the interval [0, π]. However, the example had each condition on a separate line. The original example had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So here, perhaps:\n\nAssumption: The integral is over the interval [0, π].\nAssumption: The integrand is arcsin[(1/4)√(8 - 2√(10 - 2√(17 - 8 cos x})))].\n\nThat's two assumptions. The problem is to prove that this integral equals π²/5. The rest of the context (probability, triangle sides, variable substitutions) is part of the question's background but not the problem's assumptions. So the formatted problem should list the integral's limits and the integrand as assumptions, then state the problem to prove the integral equals π²/5.",
