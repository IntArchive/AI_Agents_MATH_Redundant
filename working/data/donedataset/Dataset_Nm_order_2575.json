    "Content": "How to show that not every $\\mathbb{R}$-valued function on $[0,1]$ is a pointwise limit of continuous $\\mathbb{R}$-valued functions on $[0,1]$? There is a theorem that states that the set of points of discontinuity of a pointwise limit of continuous $\\mathbb{R}$-valued functions is Baire first category set. So we can take, for instance, function $f=\\chi([0,1]\\cap \\mathbb{Q})$ and this would be the function that is not a pointwise limit of continuous functions, according to the theorem. But the theorem is strong, it states more then we need and its proof is rather non-trivial. Is there more straightforward way to show that $f=\\chi([0,1]\\cap \\mathbb{Q})$ (or any other function) is not a pointwise limit of continuous functions?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "EDIT: As a consequence of reading the question too quickly, everything I've written below is about functions $\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$, not $[0, 1]\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ - as an exercise, show that this doesn't affect anything. Easiest (if least illuminating) way: count them. There are $2^{2^{\\aleph_0}}$-many functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$, but only $2^{\\aleph_0}$-many of those are continuous (exercise - as well as the worst proof imaginable that there exist discontinuous functions). And the number of sequences of continuous functions is no bigger: $(2^{\\aleph_0})^{\\aleph_0}=2^{\\aleph_0}$. Note that this proves a stronger result: the Baire hierarchy is the hierarchy of functions you get by starting with the continuous functions and iteratively taking pointwise limits. Baire class 1 is continuous, and for $\\alpha>1$, Baire class $\\alpha$ is the set of functions which are the limit of a sequence of functions each individually in some $<\\alpha$-level of the Baire hierarchy. The Baire hierarchy goes on for $\\omega_1$-many levels, and then you stop getting any new functions. The counting argument shows that there are functions which are not Baire class $\\alpha$, for any fixed countable $\\alpha$. And, if the continuum hypothesis fails -  that is, if $2^{\\aleph_0}>\\aleph_1$ - then this argument shows there are functions which aren't in any level of the Baire hierarchy! (By the way, there's a similar hierarchy, the Borel hierarchy , and everything I've written about the Baire hierarchy holds of the Borel hierarchy too.) We can actually show that there are some functions not in the Baire hierarchy, without any assumptions on cardinal arithmetic. But this is a bit more complicated. It goes as follows: Fix a bijection $f$ from $\\omega_1\\times\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$. Basically, to each countable ordinal $\\alpha$, $f$ associates continuum-many reals. Separately, for each $\\alpha\\in\\omega_1$, fix a bijection $g_\\alpha$ between $\\mathbb{R}$ and the set of functions of Baire class $\\alpha$. (Such a bijection exists, by the argument above; this uses transfinite induction.) Now we combine these! Let $\\mathbb{B}$ be the set of all functions in the Baire hierarchy. We can get a function $h:\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{B}$ as follows: given $r$, let $f^{-1}(r)=(\\alpha, s)$ - we let $h(r)$ be $g_\\alpha(s)$. At this point, check that $h$ is in fact a surjection from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{B}$. And now we diagonalize! Let $F(r)=h(r)(r)+1$. Then $F\\not\\in\\mathbb{B}$. Done! Note that this can be made explicit: there are lots of easily-describable (if a bit messy) bijections between $\\mathbb{R}$ and the set of continuous functions. And there are also lots of reasonbly natural injections of $\\mathbb{R}^\\omega$ and $\\mathbb{R}$. Combining these, we get an explicit bijection $\\beta$ from $\\mathbb{R}$ to the set $\\mathcal{S}$ of sequences of continuous functions. Now, we can use this to define a function $F$ which is not a pointwise limit of continuous functions as follows. If $r$ is a real, we let $F(r)$ be $1+\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty} \\beta(r)(n)(r)$, if that limit exists, and $0$, if that limit doesn't exist. This $F$ has a perfectly explicit, if annoyingly messy, definition. And it diagonalizes against the sequences of continuous functions, so it's not Baire class 2. Similarly, we can find explicit-if-messy functions not in Baire class $\\alpha$, for any fixed countable $\\alpha$. Where this breaks down is in trying to get a function which isn't in the Baire hierarchy at all: it is consistent with ZF that every function is in the Baire hierarchy (this involves killing choice to a stupidly extreme degree, however - $\\omega_1$ winds up being a countable union of countable sets!).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to format this Math Stack Exchange question according to the user's specified structure. Let me start by reading through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe user provided an example where the assumption was split into two parts: one about n being an integer and another about n being divisible by 7. Then the problem was restated concisely. \n\nLooking at the current problem from Math Stack Exchange, the title is \"Not every function on [0,1] is a pointwise limit of continuous functions on [0,1]\". The question asks how to show that not every real-valued function on [0,1] is a pointwise limit of continuous functions. They mention a theorem about the set of discontinuities being a Baire first category set and suggest using the characteristic function of the rationals in [0,1] as an example. The user is seeking a more straightforward proof for this specific case without invoking the stronger theorem.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem is about functions on [0,1], so the domain is [0,1]. The function in question is f = χ([0,1] ∩ ℚ), which is the indicator function for the rationals in [0,1]. The key points here are that f is real-valued, defined on [0,1], and we're considering pointwise limits of continuous functions. \n\nThe theorem mentioned states that the set of discontinuities of such a limit function must be a Baire first category set. However, the user wants a simpler approach. The main assumption here is that f is the characteristic function of the rationals in [0,1], which is discontinuous everywhere. Since the rationals are countable and thus a first category set, but their complement (the irrationals) is not, perhaps there's a contradiction here. But the user wants to avoid using the theorem.\n\nSo, to list the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. The problem is to show that f is not a pointwise limit of continuous functions. The original problem mentions f = χ([0,1] ∩ ℚ) as the candidate function. \n\nPossible assumptions:\n1. The function f is defined on the interval [0,1].\n2. f is the characteristic function of [0,1] ∩ ℚ (i.e., f(x) = 1 if x is rational, 0 otherwise).\n3. The problem considers pointwise limits of sequences of continuous functions from [0,1] to ℝ.\n\nWait, but the problem is to show that not every function can be such a limit, using f as an example. The user is looking for a simpler proof than invoking the Baire category theorem. So the assumptions would be about f's properties and the context of pointwise limits.\n\nSo structured:\n\nAssumption:\n- f: [0,1] → ℝ is the characteristic function of [0,1] ∩ ℚ,\n- f is considered as a pointwise limit of continuous functions [0,1] → ℝ.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to show that f is NOT such a limit. So the assumption is that f is the specific function, and the problem is to prove it's not a pointwise limit. Therefore, the assumptions should list the conditions given about f and the context.\n\nIn the example provided earlier, the assumptions were about n being an integer and n divisible by 7. Here, the function f has specific properties. Let me try to break them down:\n\nAssumption 1: f is a real-valued function defined on [0,1].\nAssumption 2: f is the characteristic function of the set [0,1] ∩ ℚ (i.e., f(x) = 1 if x is rational in [0,1], and 0 otherwise).\nAssumption 3: Consider pointwise limits of sequences of continuous real-valued functions on [0,1].\n\nBut perhaps the key here is that the problem is to show that this particular f is not a pointwise limit of continuous functions. The user already suggests using the theorem but wants a simpler method. The assumptions would then be the properties of f and the context. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe user says: \"How to show that not every R-valued function on [0,1] is a pointwise limit of continuous functions...\" and suggests using f=chi([0,1] intersect Q). The problem is to show that this specific f is not a pointwise limit. So the assumptions are:\n\n1. f is defined on [0,1].\n2. f is the characteristic function of the rational numbers in [0,1].\n3. The problem considers whether f can be expressed as a pointwise limit of continuous functions on [0,1].\n\nBut perhaps each assumption should be a single property of a single object. For example:\n\nAssumption:\n- The domain of f is the interval [0,1],\n- f is real-valued,\n- f(x) = 1 for all x ∈ [0,1] ∩ ℚ,\n- f(x) = 0 for all x ∈ [0,1] ∖ ℚ,\n- The problem involves pointwise convergence of a sequence of continuous functions from [0,1] to ℝ.\n\nBut the user's example grouped related assumptions. In their example, the two assumptions were \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So perhaps each line is a separate condition. Here, the main conditions are about f's definition. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- f: [0,1] → ℝ is defined by f(x) = 1 if x is rational, 0 otherwise,\n- We consider sequences of continuous functions g_n: [0,1] → ℝ,\n- The convergence is pointwise.\n\nBut the problem is to show that f is not a pointwise limit of such g_n. So the problem statement would be: Prove that f cannot be expressed as the pointwise limit of continuous functions on [0,1].\n\nAlternatively, to fit the example structure, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- f is the characteristic function of [0,1] ∩ ℚ,\n- f is real-valued,\n- The problem considers pointwise limits of continuous functions on [0,1].\n\nBut in the example, the problem was restated concisely. So perhaps:\n\nProblem: Prove that f(x) = χ_{[0,1] ∩ ℚ}(x) is not a pointwise limit of continuous functions on [0,1].\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n- f: [0,1] → ℝ is defined by f(x) = 1 if x ∈ ℚ ∩ [0,1], and f(x) = 0 otherwise,\n- The problem concerns pointwise limits of sequences of continuous functions from [0,1] to ℝ.\n\nProblem: Prove that f cannot be expressed as the pointwise limit of continuous functions on [0,1].\n\nWait, but the original problem is more general: \"show that not every function is a pointwise limit...\" but the example uses f=chi(Q∩[0,1]). The user is asking for a way to show this for f (or another function) without using the strong theorem. So the formatted problem should focus on proving that this specific f is not a pointwise limit.\n\nHence, the assumptions would be about the definition of f and the context (pointwise limits of continuous functions). So:\n\nAssumption:\n- The function f is defined on [0,1],\n- For each x in [0,1], f(x) = 1 if x is rational and f(x) = 0 otherwise,\n- The problem involves determining whether f is a pointwise limit of continuous functions from [0,1] to ℝ.\n\nBut each assumption line should address only one property. So splitting into separate lines:\n\nAssumption:\n- The domain of f is the interval [0,1],\n- f is a real-valued function,\n- For every rational number x in [0,1], f(x) = 1,\n- For every irrational number x in [0,1], f(x) = 0,\n- The problem considers sequences of continuous real-valued functions on [0,1],\n- Convergence is considered in the pointwise sense.\n\nProblem: Prove that f cannot be expressed as the pointwise limit of a sequence of continuous functions on [0,1].\n\nBut in the user's example, the assumptions were concise. Maybe we can condense some parts. For example:\n\nAssumption:\n- f: [0,1] → ℝ is the characteristic function of [0,1] ∩ ℚ,\n- Each function in the sequence is continuous on [0,1],\n- Convergence is pointwise.\n\nProblem: Prove that f is not the pointwise limit of such a sequence.\n\nAlternatively, following the example's style where the assumptions are more about the conditions on the objects involved. The original example had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Here, perhaps the key assumptions are about f's definition and the type of convergence.\n\nSo final take:\n\nAssumption:\n- f is the characteristic function of [0,1] ∩ ℚ,\n- f is real-valued,\n- The problem concerns pointwise limits of continuous functions on [0,1].\n\nProblem: Prove that f cannot be expressed as a pointwise limit of continuous real-valued functions on [0,1].\n\nBut the user's example had each assumption line as a single condition. So splitting:\n\nAssumption:\n- The domain of f is [0,1],\n- f is real-valued,\n- f(x) = 1 for all x ∈ [0,1] ∩ ℚ,\n- f(x) = 0 for all x ∈ [0,1] ∖ ℚ,\n- The sequence of functions considered consists of continuous functions from [0,1] to ℝ,\n- The convergence is pointwise.\n\nBut maybe that's too detailed. The key is to capture the essential assumptions without verbosity. The example only listed two assumptions, even though the original problem had more. Perhaps the critical assumptions here are the definition of f and the context of pointwise limits of continuous functions.\n\nI think the most concise way is:\n\nAssumption:\n- f: [0,1] → ℝ is defined by f(x) = χ_{ℚ}(x) (the characteristic function of rationals in [0,1]),\n- We consider pointwise convergence of continuous functions on [0,1].\n\nProblem: Prove that f is not a pointwise limit of continuous functions on [0,1].\n\nThis seems to align with the example's structure. Each assumption is a single condition. The first line defines f, the second sets the context of pointwise limits. The problem is to prove f isn't such a limit.",
