    "Content": "The following is exercise 8 (section 2.6) in Algebra by Hungerford: Let $p$ be an odd prime. Prove that there are at most two nonabelian groups of order $p^3$ . (One has generators $a,b$ satisying $|a| = p^2; |b|=p;b^{-1}ab = a^{1+p}$ and the other has generators $a,b,c$ satisfying $|a|=|b| = |c|= p;c = a^{-1}b^{-1}ab;ca=ac;cb=bc$ ) I realize that there are many links online classifying groups of order $p^3$ . However, most of the solutions I have seen have required several pages of work.  Since this is just an exercise, I suspect there is a shorter solution. I have come up with the following: We know that $Z(G) = p$ because $G$ is a $p$ -group and if $|Z(G)| = p^2$ or $p^3$ , then $G/Z(G)$ would be cyclic. Thus, $G$ would be abelian, contrary to hypothesis. So, let $c$ be a generator for $Z(G)$ . Consider the quotient group $G/Z(G)$ which has order $p^2$ . Hence, $G/Z(G) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_p \\times \\mathbb{Z}_p$ . Let $\\overline{a},\\overline{b}$ be generators for $G/Z(G)$ (the overlines denote passage to the quotient). Now, this means that every element in $G$ can be written as $a^ib^jc^k$ for $i,j,k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ . Since $c \\in Z(G)$ we cannot have that $a,b$ commute (this is important later). Notice that $\\overline{a},\\overline{b}$ both have order $p$ in $G/Z(G)$ . Thus, $a^p,b^p \\in Z(G)$ . We consider cases of $a^p$ and $b^p$ . Case 1: both $a^p = b^p = 1$ Then, since $G/Z(G)$ is abelian, the commutator subgroup, $G'$ , is contained in $Z(G)$ so that $|G'| = 1 $ or $p$ . But, $|G'| = 1$ implies $G$ is abelian, contrary to hypothesis. So, $|G'| = p$ and consequently $G' = Z(G)$ . Thus, since $a,b$ do not commute, $a^{-1}b^{-1}ab$ is nontrivial and $Z(G) = \\langle a^{-1}b^{-1}ab\\rangle$ (this is by the previous exercise where we showed that the commutator subgroup is generated by elements of this form). Thus, by possibly switching generators for $Z(G)$ this group satisfies the second pair of generators and relations in the question. Case 2: $a^p \\neq 1$ and $b^p = 1$ (or vice versa) In this case $a^p$ is a nontrivial element in $Z(G)$ and since $Z(G)$ is cyclic of order $p$ , $c = a^p$ and so $|a| = p^2$ . This gives rise to the first pair of generators and relations. It is here where I am stuck. These should be the only two, but I have not found a reason why we cannot have $a^p \\neq 1$ and $b^p \\neq 1$ . How can I guarantee that this case does not occur (or gives one of the two cases above)? I assume this has something to do with the oddness of $p$ , as I have not used this anywhere in the argument. Moreoever, any other suggestions or corrections on the current work would be greatly appreciated. Thank You",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "As @Arturo Magidin suggests in a comment, you only need to tweak your generators. For suppose $a$ and $b$ have order $p^2$ ; then by taking suitable powers we can assume $a^p=c$ , $b^p=c^{-1}$ where $c$ is a generator of the centre. Now use the magic fact: as the derived group is central we have $$a^n b^n=(ab)^n [b,a]^{n\\choose 2}$$ . (See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutator ). Now take $n=p$ , an odd prime, so that $p$ divides $p\\choose 2$ : we will get $$c c^{-1}=(ab)^p$$ and so can replace the generators $a,b$ by new generators $a,ab$ of orders $p^2, p$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. The user is asking why the case where both $a^p \\neq 1$ and $b^p \\neq 1$ doesn't lead to a third nonabelian group of order $p^3$, especially considering that the prime $p$ is odd. The user also hasn't used the fact that $p$ is odd yet, so maybe that's key here.\n\nFirst, let's recap the setup. We have a nonabelian group $G$ of order $p^3$ with $|Z(G)| = p$. The quotient $G/Z(G)$ is $\\mathbb{Z}_p \\times \\mathbb{Z}_p$, so we can lift generators $\\overline{a}$ and $\\overline{b}$ from the quotient to elements $a$ and $b$ in $G$. The elements $a$ and $b$ don't commute because $G$ is nonabelian. The elements $a^p$ and $b^p$ are in the center $Z(G)$ since the quotient has exponent $p$.\n\nIn Case 1, both $a^p = 1$ and $b^p = 1$, leading to the group with generators $a, b, c$ where $c$ is a central element and the relations are as given. In Case 2, one of $a^p$ or $b^p$ is nontrivial, leading to the group with a generator of order $p^2$. The user is stuck on the possibility where both $a^p \\neq 1$ and $b^p \\neq 1$.\n\nSo, suppose both $a^p$ and $b^p$ are non-trivial in $Z(G)$. Since $Z(G)$ is cyclic of order $p$, any non-trivial element is a generator. Therefore, we can write $a^p = c^k$ and $b^p = c^m$ for some integers $k, m$ not divisible by $p$. Since $c$ is a generator, we can adjust our generators. For example, if $a^p = c^k$, then replacing $a$ with $a^{k^{-1}}$ (where $k^{-1}$ is modulo $p$) would make $a^p = c$. Similarly for $b^p = c^m$, replacing $b$ with $b^{m^{-1}}$ would make $b^p = c$.\n\nBut here's the thing: if both $a$ and $b$ have order $p^2$, then their $p$th powers are both generators of $Z(G)$. However, in such a case, maybe we can relate $a$ and $b$ in a way that one can be expressed in terms of the other, thereby reducing to one of the previous cases.\n\nWait, but even if we set $a^p = c$ and $b^p = c$, then perhaps we can adjust the generators. For example, if $a$ and $b$ both have order $p^2$, then maybe we can find a new generator $b' = ab^{-1}$ or something, such that $(b')^p = a^p (b^{-1})^p = c \\cdot c^{-1} = 1$, thereby reducing to Case 1. However, this might complicate the commutator relations.\n\nAlternatively, since $G/Z(G)$ is generated by $\\overline{a}$ and $\\overline{b}$, the commutator $[a,b] = a^{-1}b^{-1}ab$ must generate $Z(G)$. Let's say $[a,b] = c$. Then, using the Hall-Witt identity or commutator relations, maybe we can derive some constraints.\n\nBut perhaps the key is the property of the exponent of the group. In a group of exponent $p$, all elements have order $p$, but here if both $a$ and $b$ have order $p^2$, then the group has exponent $p^2$. However, for odd primes, such groups are known to be regular, which might imply some properties about the product of elements. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, the user mentions that $p$ is odd, and this hasn't been used yet. In the case of $p=2$, the dihedral group of order 8 is nonabelian, but there are more groups of order 8. However, for odd primes, the number of nonabelian groups of order $p^3$ is exactly two. So maybe when $p$ is odd, having two elements of order $p^2$ would force some relation that allows us to adjust the generators to fall into the first case.\n\nAlternatively, suppose both $a$ and $b$ have order $p^2$, with $a^p = c$ and $b^p = c^k$ for some $k$. Then, if we replace $b$ with $b a^{-k}$, we might find that $(b a^{-k})^p = b^p a^{-k p} = c^k (a^p)^{-k} = c^k c^{-k} = 1$, since $a^p = c$. However, $a$ and $b$ commute with $a^{-k}$ only if $a^{-k}$ is central, which it is. Wait, $a^{-k}$ is in the center, so conjugation by $b$ leaves it invariant. Therefore, $(b a^{-k})^p = b^p (a^{-k})^p$ because $a^{-k}$ is central. Since $a^p = c$, $(a^{-k})^p = c^{-k}$. Then, $b^p = c^k$, so $(b a^{-k})^p = c^k c^{-k} = 1$. Thus, replacing $b$ with $b a^{-k}$, we get a new generator $b' = b a^{-k}$ such that $(b')^p = 1$. Then, $a$ has order $p^2$, $b'$ has order $p$, and their commutator is still $c$ (since $b'$ differs from $b$ by a central element, which doesn't affect the commutator). Therefore, this reduces to Case 2, where one generator has order $p^2$ and the other has order $p$.\n\nTherefore, the case where both $a^p \\neq 1$ and $b^p \\neq 1$ can be transformed into Case 2 by adjusting the generator $b$. This uses the fact that $p$ is odd, perhaps in the step where we take the exponent $k$ and invert it modulo $p$, which is possible because $p$ is prime and $k$ is not divisible by $p$. Wait, but does this specifically require $p$ to be odd? Maybe not directly, but in the case when $p=2$, such adjustments might not work because the structure is different. For example, in the quaternion group of order 8, all elements have order 4, but adjusting generators might not lead to a similar reduction. Hence, the oddness of $p$ ensures that such a replacement works, perhaps because the group is regular, allowing the manipulation of exponents.\n\nSo, the crux is that if both $a^p$ and $b^p$ are nontrivial, we can modify one of the generators (using the central elements) to make its $p$th power trivial, thereby reducing to the case where only one generator has a nontrivial $p$th power. This adjustment relies on the fact that $Z(G)$ is cyclic of order $p$ and that we can scale the generators appropriately, which works because $p$ is odd. Therefore, the case where both $a^p \\neq 1$ and $b^p \\neq 1$ doesn't lead to a new group, but instead can be transformed into one of the existing cases. Thus, there are at most two nonabelian groups of order $p^3$ when $p$ is an odd prime.",
