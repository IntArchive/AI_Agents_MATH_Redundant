    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor, read the Math Stack Exchange question, filter out unrelated info, and structure it with Assumptions and Problem sections.\n\nFirst, the original problem is titled: \"Prove that if (x + sqrt(x² + 1))(y + sqrt(y² + 1)) = 1 then x + y = 0\". The question includes the user's solution where they set a = x + sqrt(x² + 1) and b = y + sqrt(y² + 1), then express x and y in terms of a and b, use the condition ab = 1, substitute, and show x + y = 0. They're asking if their solution is correct and if they made any unwarranted assumptions.\n\nBut according to the example provided, the task is to list assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object, then state the problem. The example extracted assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", even though the original problem just said \"for every integer n\". Wait, in the example, maybe the user added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption? Wait no, looking back, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, so the assumptions might be that n is an integer and perhaps something else, but in the example, the formatted problem includes \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption is \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Hmm, maybe that's a mistake. Wait, perhaps the example was from a different problem where the user needed to assume n is divisible by 7? Maybe the example given was not directly from the problem as written here. Wait, the user says \"Original problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that seems contradictory because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which would mean the only assumption is n is an integer, but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Maybe there was a mistake in the example. Wait, perhaps the original problem actually had a different condition, but here the user might have made an error. Alternatively, maybe the example is incorrect, but I should follow the user's instructions regardless.\n\nIn any case, for the current problem, the user wants me to extract the assumptions and the problem. The original problem states: if (x + sqrt(x² +1))(y + sqrt(y² +1)) =1, then prove x + y =0. The question includes the user's solution, but when structuring, I need to filter out the user's solution and their doubts, focusing only on the problem's conditions.\n\nSo the main assumption here is that (x + sqrt(x² +1))(y + sqrt(y² +1)) =1. The conclusion to prove is x + y =0. So the assumptions should list each condition. But in this problem, the only given condition is that the product equals 1. However, perhaps we need to check if there are any implicit assumptions. For example, x and y are real numbers because sqrt(x² +1) is real, which implies x is real. Similarly for y. So maybe the assumption is that x and y are real numbers such that sqrt(x² +1) and sqrt(y² +1) are defined. But in the original problem statement, is that specified? The problem as stated just gives the equation and asks to prove x + y =0. The user didn't specify if x and y are real. But since they are using sqrt(x² +1), it's implied that x and y are real numbers. So perhaps the assumptions should include that x and y are real numbers. But in the problem statement, the user didn't mention that. However, in mathematical problems, unless otherwise specified, variables are usually assumed to be real if square roots are involved. But in the formatted example, the assumption for the divisibility problem was \"n is an integer\", which was given in the original problem. So maybe here, the assumption is just the equation given. Wait, but in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which was translated into an assumption \"n is an integer\". Then another assumption \"n is divisible by 7\", but that might be part of the problem's conditions? Wait, maybe there was a misalignment in the example. But perhaps the user wants me to list all the given conditions as assumptions. In this case, the problem says \"if (x + sqrt(x² +1))(y + sqrt(y² +1)) =1\", so that's the main condition. So perhaps the assumption here is just that product equals 1, and the problem is to prove x + y =0.\n\nBut the example included multiple assumptions even when the original problem had one. Wait, in the example, the original problem was \"for every integer n\", which would translate to the assumption \"n is an integer\". But the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original. That suggests perhaps the example is incorrect, but I should proceed with the current problem.\n\nSo in the current problem, the only explicit condition is (x + sqrt(x² +1))(y + sqrt(y² +1)) =1. Therefore, the assumption should be that this product equals 1. However, perhaps there are implicit assumptions about x and y being real numbers. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe the user wants only the explicit assumption. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem was \"for every integer n\", which became the assumption \"n is an integer\". Then there was another assumption \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems to be incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", not only those divisible by 7. So perhaps the example is wrong. Maybe the user intended to have only the given conditions as assumptions. Alternatively, maybe in the example, the problem was miswritten, and the actual problem was to prove divisibility by 91 when n is divisible by 7. But regardless, I need to focus on the current problem.\n\nSo, for the current problem: the given condition is the product equals 1, and the conclusion is x + y =0. Are there other assumptions? For example, the variables x and y must be real numbers because otherwise sqrt(x² +1) might not be real. But the problem doesn't state that. However, if x and y are complex, the equation might still hold, but the conclusion might not. For instance, if x and y are complex numbers, x + y =0 might not necessarily follow. But in the context of the problem, since the user's solution manipulates square roots and reciprocals, it's likely intended that x and y are real numbers. So perhaps the assumption is that x and y are real numbers such that the product equals 1. However, the problem statement doesn't specify that x and y are real. Therefore, should I include that as an assumption? The example didn't include implicit assumptions. In the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which became an assumption. The user might want to list only the given explicit conditions as assumptions. Therefore, in this case, the only explicit condition is that the product equals 1. Therefore, the assumption is:\n\nAssumption:\n$\\left({x+\\sqrt{x^2+1}}\\right)\\left({y+\\sqrt{y^2+1}}\\right)=1$\n\nProblem:\nProve that $x + y = 0$.\n\nBut wait, according to the example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. The equation here involves both x and y. But the user's example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", both about n. Here, the equation is a relation between x and y. So perhaps this single equation is one assumption. However, the user's example listed each assumption line by line. In this case, there's only one assumption, which is the equation. Therefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n$\\left({x+\\sqrt{x^2+1}}\\right)\\left({y+\\sqrt{y^2+1}}\\right)=1$\n\nProblem:\nProve that $x + y = 0$.\n\nBut wait, the original problem might require x and y to be real numbers. Let me check the user's solution. In their solution, they let a = x + sqrt(x² +1), then express x in terms of a. If x is real, then sqrt(x² +1) is positive, so a is positive. Then since ab =1, b =1/a, which would also be positive. Then they substitute and get x + y =0. But if x is allowed to be complex, then sqrt(x² +1) is not necessarily real, and the manipulation might not hold. However, the problem doesn't specify, so maybe the assumption is that x and y are real numbers. But the original problem statement doesn't state that. So should I include that as an assumption?\n\nIn the example, the assumption was \"n is an integer\", which was part of the original problem's statement. So perhaps in this case, even if the problem doesn't state it explicitly, if there's a common implicit assumption (like variables being real when square roots are involved), we should include it. So here, the assumption would be:\n\nAssumption:\n$x$ is a real number,\n$y$ is a real number,\n$\\left({x+\\sqrt{x^2+1}}\\right)\\left({y+\\sqrt{y^2+1}}\\right)=1$\n\nProblem:\nProve that $x + y = 0$.\n\nBut I need to check if the original problem specifies x and y as real. Looking at the original problem: \"Prove that if (x + sqrt(x² +1))(y + sqrt(y² +1))=1 then x + y=0\". It doesn't state that x and y are real. But given the use of square roots, it's standard to assume real numbers unless otherwise stated. However, to be precise, perhaps the problem expects x and y to be real. Therefore, including those as assumptions would be correct. But how does the example handle this? In the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", so the assumption was \"n is an integer\". Here, since the problem doesn't specify, but the context implies real numbers, maybe it's safer to include them as assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem works even if x and y are complex, but in that case, the conclusion might not hold. For example, if x is complex, y could be such that their product equals 1 without x + y =0. But I think the problem is intended for real numbers. Therefore, to make the problem well-posed, we need to assume x and y are real. Therefore, the assumptions should include that x and y are real numbers, and their product equals 1.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n$x$ is a real number,\n$y$ is a real number,\n$\\left({x+\\sqrt{x^2+1}}\\right)\\left({y+\\sqrt{y^2+1}}\\right)=1$\n\nProblem:\nProve that $x + y = 0$.\n\nBut let me check the user's example again. In their example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n...\", which became \"Assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem didn't say n is divisible by 7. That suggests that maybe the example is incorrect, and perhaps the user intended to have the problem with n divisible by 7. But regardless, for the current problem, I need to follow the instruction to list each assumption line by line, each addressing only one property or condition applied to one object. Therefore, each assumption line here would be:\n\n- x is a real number\n- y is a real number\n- The product (x + sqrt(x² +1))(y + sqrt(y² +1)) equals 1\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were listed as separate lines, each about a single object. So if \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are two separate assumptions, then here, \"x is real\" and \"y is real\" are separate, and the product equation is another assumption. So that's three assumptions. However, the original problem didn't state that x and y are real. But in standard math problems, when square roots are involved, we often assume variables are real unless stated otherwise. However, if the problem allows complex numbers, the conclusion might not hold. Therefore, to be precise, the problem should specify that x and y are real. Since the original problem didn't, but the user's solution likely assumes real numbers (since they express x in terms of a and take reciprocals), it's safer to include that as an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem holds even for complex numbers, but proving that x + y =0 under the given product condition regardless of x and y being real or complex. However, I think that's not the case. For example, if x is a complex number such that x + sqrt(x² +1) = a, then y + sqrt(y² +1) =1/a. But there might be solutions where x + y ≠0. However, if we restrict to real numbers, then it's true. Therefore, the problem likely assumes x and y are real. Hence, the assumptions should include that x and y are real numbers.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem is:\n\nAssumption:\n$x$ is a real number,\n$y$ is a real number,\n$\\left({x+\\sqrt{x^2+1}}\\right)\\left({y+\\sqrt{y^2+1}}\\right)=1$\n\nProblem:\nProve that $x + y = 0$.\n\nBut the original problem's title and question do not mention x and y being real. The user's solution uses algebraic manipulations that would work for real numbers but might not hold in the complex plane. Therefore, to match the problem's intended scope, it's necessary to include the assumption that x and y are real. Hence, this structured format includes those assumptions.",
