    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. So, the problem says that we have a sequence a_n where each term is positive, and the sum of a_n converges. We need to show that there exists another sequence c_n, also positive, such that c_n tends to infinity as n goes to infinity, and the sum of a_n times c_n is still finite. Hmm, interesting.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some related theorems or examples. Since the sum of a_n converges, that means a_n approaches zero. But we need c_n to go to infinity, which is the opposite direction. So even though a_n is getting small, multiplying it by c_n which is getting large, the product still needs to be summable. \n\nMaybe I can construct such a c_n. How? Let's think about the convergence of the series. Since the sum of a_n converges, the tail of the series must go to zero. That is, for any epsilon, there exists an N such that the sum from N to infinity of a_n is less than epsilon. Maybe we can use that to define c_n in some way that increases but doesn't blow up the sum.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps use the fact that a_n is the general term of a convergent series. So, maybe the sequence a_n is bounded by some other sequence. For example, if we can find a sequence that dominates a_n but is still summable. Wait, but here we need to multiply a_n by c_n to get something summable, with c_n approaching infinity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can construct c_n such that it grows, but in a way that the product a_n c_n decreases sufficiently fast. For example, if c_n is something like 1/sqrt(a_n), but wait, that might not necessarily tend to infinity. Also, a_n is going to zero, so 1/sqrt(a_n) would go to infinity. But then a_n * c_n would be sqrt(a_n), and if sum sqrt(a_n) converges, that's not guaranteed. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nWait, but we don't know anything about the rate of convergence of a_n. The problem states only that the sum converges. So we can't assume any specific rate, like a_n being 1/n^2 or something. So we need a method that works for any convergent series with positive terms.\n\nI remember that if a series converges, then the terms a_n must be o(1/n), but that's not necessarily true. For example, the series sum 1/n^2 converges, but 1/n^2 is o(1/n). However, there are convergent series with terms larger than 1/n. For example, sum 1/(n log n) diverges, but sum 1/(n (log n)^2) converges. So maybe the terms can be as big as 1/(n (log n)^alpha) for some alpha >1. But this is getting too specific.\n\nBack to the problem. Since the series converges, for each k, there exists an N_k such that the sum from N_k to infinity of a_n is less than 1/k^2. Then, maybe define c_n to be k for n between N_{k-1} and N_k. But this might not work. Let me see. If we partition the natural numbers into blocks where in each block, the sum of a_n is small, then assign c_n to be increasing on each block. But how to make sure that c_n tends to infinity?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use a diagonal argument or construct c_n such that a_n c_n is summable. Let me think about constructing c_n step by step.\n\nGiven that sum a_n converges, for each n, let's define c_n such that c_n <= M for some M, but that would not make c_n go to infinity. Wait, but we need c_n to go to infinity. So perhaps construct c_n in a way that it increases slowly enough so that a_n c_n is still summable.\n\nAnother idea: Since sum a_n converges, then the partial sums S_N = sum_{n=1}^N a_n approach some limit S. Then, maybe define c_n = 1/sqrt(S - S_{n-1}}). Wait, but S - S_{n-1} is the tail of the series starting at n, right? Let me denote T_n = sum_{k=n}^\\infty a_k. Then T_n approaches zero as n approaches infinity. If we set c_n = 1/sqrt(T_n}, then c_n tends to infinity because T_n tends to zero. Then, a_n c_n = a_n / sqrt(T_n). Now, we need to check if sum a_n / sqrt(T_n) converges.\n\nBut how can we check that? Let's see. Let's consider the series sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n / sqrt(T_n). Maybe we can compare this to a telescoping series. Let me try to consider the difference sqrt(T_n) - sqrt(T_{n+1}}). Since T_{n} = T_{n+1} + a_n. So sqrt(T_n) - sqrt(T_{n+1}}) = [T_n - T_{n+1}}]/[sqrt(T_n) + sqrt(T_{n+1}})] = a_n / [sqrt(T_n) + sqrt(T_{n+1}})].\n\nSince sqrt(T_n) + sqrt(T_{n+1}}) >= sqrt(T_{n+1}}) + sqrt(T_{n+1}}) = 2 sqrt(T_{n+1}}), so:\n\nsqrt(T_n) - sqrt(T_{n+1}}) <= a_n / (2 sqrt(T_{n+1}}))\n\nBut we have a_n / sqrt(T_n). Maybe this is not directly helpful. Alternatively, if we take the sum from n=1 to N of a_n / sqrt(T_n) <= sum_{n=1}^N [sqrt(T_n) - sqrt(T_{n+1}})] * 2 sqrt(T_{n}) / sqrt(T_{n})} ?\n\nWait, let's try:\n\nFrom the previous expression, a_n = [sqrt(T_n) - sqrt(T_{n+1}})] * [sqrt(T_n) + sqrt(T_{n+1}})]\n\nSo, a_n / sqrt(T_n) = [sqrt(T_n) - sqrt(T_{n+1}})] * [sqrt(T_n) + sqrt(T_{n+1}})] / sqrt(T_n)\n\n= [sqrt(T_n) - sqrt(T_{n+1}})] * [1 + sqrt(T_{n+1}})/sqrt(T_n)]\n\nSince T_{n+1} = T_n - a_n <= T_n, so sqrt(T_{n+1}})/sqrt(T_n) <= 1. Therefore, [1 + sqrt(T_{n+1}})/sqrt(T_n)] <= 2.\n\nTherefore, a_n / sqrt(T_n) <= 2 [sqrt(T_n) - sqrt(T_{n+1}})]\n\nTherefore, the sum from n=1 to N of a_n / sqrt(T_n) <= 2 [sqrt(T_1) - sqrt(T_{N+1}})]\n\nSince as N approaches infinity, sqrt(T_{N+1}}) approaches 0, so the sum converges to 2 sqrt(T_1). Therefore, the series sum a_n / sqrt(T_n) converges. So if we set c_n = 1 / sqrt(T_n), then c_n tends to infinity, and sum a_n c_n converges.\n\nWow, that works! So the construction is to take c_n = 1 / sqrt(T_n), where T_n is the tail sum starting at n. Therefore, this c_n satisfies the required conditions.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that c_n must be positive, which it is, since T_n is positive (as all a_n are positive and the series converges, so tails are positive). Also, c_n tends to infinity because T_n tends to zero. And we just showed that sum a_n c_n converges. Therefore, this construction works.\n\nTherefore, the answer is to define c_n as the reciprocal of the square root of the tail sum T_n. This satisfies all the conditions.\n\nBut let me check if there's a simpler way. For example, could we use a sequence c_n that grows slower, like log n? But no, because if a_n is 1/n^2, then c_n = log n would make sum a_n c_n = sum log n / n^2, which converges. But in this case, log n tends to infinity. So maybe that's another example. However, the problem requires that for any convergent series a_n, such a c_n exists. So we can't assume a specific form for a_n. Therefore, the previous construction with the tail sum is more general.\n\nWait, but if we use c_n = 1 / sqrt(T_n), then T_n is the tail sum, which depends on the sequence a_n. So this construction is specific to the given sequence a_n, which is acceptable because the problem asks to show existence, not to give a universal c_n that works for all a_n. So for each a_n, we can construct such a c_n.\n\nTherefore, the answer is correct. So the key steps are:\n\n1. Define T_n = sum_{k=n}^\\infty a_k (which is finite because the series converges).\n\n2. Set c_n = 1 / sqrt(T_n). Then c_n tends to infinity as n increases because T_n tends to zero.\n\n3. Show that sum a_n c_n = sum a_n / sqrt(T_n) converges, by comparing it to a telescoping series.\n\nTherefore, this construction works.\n\nAlternatively, another approach could involve using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, but I think the tail sum approach is more straightforward.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe use the fact that for convergent series, you can find a sequence b_n increasing to infinity such that sum a_n b_n converges. This is a known result in analysis, often related to the comparison test or weighted series. The problem here is a specific case of that general result.\n\nIn any case, the construction using the tail sums seems to work. So the answer is to construct c_n based on the tail sums, ensuring that c_n increases to infinity and that the weighted series converges.",
