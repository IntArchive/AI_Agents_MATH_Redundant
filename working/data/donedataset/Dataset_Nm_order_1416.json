    "Content": "Let $X$ be a finite dimensional real linear space, or more generally a finite dimensional vector space over a field of characteristic $0$ . \nLet $(P_i)_{i=1}^n$ be a finite sequence of linear mappings $P_i :X\\rightarrow X$ such that $P_i^2=P_i$ for $i=1,...,n$ , $(P_1+...+P_n)^2=P_1+...+P_n$ . I wish to show that $$P_i\\circ P_j=0 \\textrm{ for } i \\neq j.$$ I know how to prove it only for $n=2$ :\nif $(P_1+P_2)^2=P_1+P_2$ then $$P_1P_2+P_2P_1=0. \\tag{$\\ast$}$$ By multiplying both sides this equality by $P_1$ from left and by $P_1$ by right and obtain two equalities: $P_1 P_2+P_1P_2P_1=0$ and $P_1P_2P_1+P_2P_1=0$ .\nBy subtracting: $$P_1P_2-P_2P_1=0. \\tag{$\\ast\\ast$}$$ From $(\\ast)$ , $({\\ast}\\ast)$ , we get $P_1P_2=0$ , $P_2P_1=0$ .",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "First, note that the condition that $X$ has finite dimension seems actually important (see linked question in comment below). An important property of projectors in finite dimensional spaces (over fields with characteristic $0$ ) is that their trace coincides with their rank (indeed, since $0$ and $1$ are the only eigenvalues, both the rank and the trace count the number of ones). Let $p=p_1+p_2+\\ldots +p_n$ , $K={\\sf Ker}(p),A={\\sf Im}(p)$ and $A_i={\\sf Im}(p_i)$ . By the remark made just above, $${\\sf dim}(A)=\\sum_{k=1}^n {\\sf dim}(A_k), \\ A \\subseteq \\sum_{k=1}^n A_k \\tag{1}$$ The two facts above imply that $A$ is the direct sum of the $A_k$ . Since $p$ is a projector, $X=K \\oplus A$ , and hence $$\nX=K \\oplus \\bigoplus_{k=1}^n A_k \\tag{2}\n$$ For $k\\in K$ , one has $0=pk=\\sum_{j=1}^n p_jk$ . By the unicity in decomposition\n(2) above, we deduce that $$\np_j \\ \\text{is zero on} \\ K \\ (1\\leq j\\leq n) \\tag{3}\n$$ Now, let $q_{ij}$ be the unique endomorphism of $X$ that coincides with $p_i$ on $A_j$ , and is zero on $K$ and $\\bigoplus_{k\\leq j}A_k$ . By contruction, those $n^2$ endomorphisms $q_{ij} (1\\leq i,j \\leq n)$ are linearly independent, and we have $p_i=\\displaystyle\\sum_{j}q_{ij}$ for every $i$ , so $$\np=\\sum_{i,j} q_{ij} \\tag{4}\n$$ On the other hand, since $p_i$ is a projector it is the identity on its image $A_i$ , $q_{ii}$ must be the identity on $A_i$ , so $$\np=\\sum_{i} q_{ii} \\tag{5}\n$$ Combining (4) with (5), we see that $\\sum_{i\\neq j}q_{ij}=0$ . By the linear \nindependence of the $q_{ij}$ , we deduce $q_{ij}=0$ for any $i\\neq j$ . So each $p_i$ reduces to $q_{ii}$ , and $p_i$ is the projector onto $A_i$ according to $K\\oplus \\bigoplus_{k\\leq j}A_k$ . The claimed property is now clear.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants to show that if you have a finite sequence of linear mappings (projections) where each P_i is idempotent (P_i squared equals P_i) and the sum of all P_i is also idempotent, then the composition of different P_i and P_j must be zero. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The vector space is finite-dimensional over a field of characteristic 0. Each P_i is a linear map on X, and each P_i is idempotent. The sum of all P_i is also idempotent. The conclusion is that the composition of any two distinct P_i and P_j is zero. \n\nWait, the original problem mentions \"finite dimensional real linear space, or more generally a finite dimensional vector space over a field of characteristic 0\". So the field has characteristic 0. That's an important condition because in positive characteristic, maybe some steps in the proof don't hold, especially if division by integers is involved. \n\nThe problem statement in the user's example was structured with each assumption on a separate line, each applying to one object. So for this case, the assumptions would be:\n\n- X is a finite-dimensional vector space over a field of characteristic 0.\n- Each P_i is a linear mapping from X to X.\n- Each P_i is idempotent (P_i^2 = P_i for each i).\n- The sum of P_i from i=1 to n is idempotent ((P_1 + ... + P_n)^2 = P_1 + ... + P_n).\n\nThe problem is to show that P_i composed with P_j is zero when i ≠ j.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is a single property for one object. So breaking down, the vector space's field characteristic is separate from its dimension. Wait, the user's example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. So here, \"X is finite-dimensional\" and \"over a field of characteristic 0\" could be separate assumptions. Or maybe \"X is a finite-dimensional vector space over a field of characteristic 0\" as one line. But the example had two separate lines for two different properties of the same object (n). So here, perhaps:\n\n- X is a finite-dimensional vector space.\n- The field of X has characteristic 0.\n- For each i, P_i is a linear mapping on X.\n- For each i, P_i is idempotent (P_i² = P_i).\n- The sum P_1 + ... + P_n is idempotent.\n\nThat way, each assumption is one property. Then the problem is to prove P_i ∘ P_j = 0 for i ≠ j.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have these assumptions listed line by line, each as a single condition. Then the problem statement as given. The original problem's title is about showing P_i and sum P_i being idempotent implies P_i P_j = δ_ij, which is equivalent to P_i P_j =0 for i≠j. So the problem part is correctly restated as \"Prove that P_i ∘ P_j =0 for i≠j\".\n\nI need to check if there are any other hidden assumptions. The problem mentions \"finite dimensional real linear space\" but generalizes to any field of characteristic 0. So in the assumptions, the field's characteristic is specified. The linearity of the mappings is also an assumption. Each P_i is a linear map. The problem doesn't state any other conditions, like invertibility or anything else. So the key assumptions are the idempotence of each P_i, the idempotence of their sum, the space's finite dimension, and the field characteristic. \n\nYes, that should cover all the necessary assumptions. Each is a separate line, addressing one property. Then the problem is to prove the composition is zero for distinct i and j.",
