    "AcceptedAnswer": "The sum of the integers from $1$ to $n$ is $n(n+1)/2$. The sum of the integers from $k$ to $k+n$ is then \n$$\\begin{align*}\nk+(k+1)+\\cdots+(k+n) &= (n+1)k + 1+\\cdots+n\\\\\n& = (n+1)k + \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\\\\n&= \\frac{(n+1)(2k+n)}{2}.\\end{align*}$$ Therefore, $a$ can be expressed as the sum of consecutive integers if and only if $2a$ can be factored as $(n+1)(2k+n)$. Suppose that $a$ is a power of $2$. Then $2a$ is a power of $2$, so $(n+1)(2k+n)$ must be a power of $2$. If we want to avoid negatives, and also avoid the trivial expression as a sum with one summand, we must have $n\\geq 1$ and $k\\gt 0$. But the parities of $n+1$ and of $2k+n$ are opposite, so this product cannot be a power of $2$ unless either $n+1=1$ (which requies $n=0$) or $2k+n=1$ (which requires $k=0$). Thus, no power of $2$ can be expressed as a sum of at least two consecutive positive integers. In particular, $8$, $16$, $32$, etc cannot be so expressed. On the other hand, suppose that $a$ is even but not a power of $2$. If we can write $2a = pq$ with $p\\gt 1$ and odd, $q$ even, and $q\\geq p+1$, then setting $n=p-1$ and $k=(q-p+1)/2$ gives the desired decomposition. If this cannot be done, then every time we factor $2a$ as $pq$ with $p\\gt 1$ odd, we have $q\\lt p+1$. Then we can set $n=q-1$ and $k = (p+1-q)/2$. Thus, the powers of $2$ are the only even numbers that are not expressible as the sum of at least two consecutive positive integers. Added. The OP has now excluded powers of $2$, but has also required that the sum contains strictly more than two summands; i.e., $k\\gt 0$ and $n\\gt 1$. With the above decompositions, the only case in which we could have $n=1$ is if $2a=pq$ with $p$ odd, $p\\gt 1$, and $q=2$. But this is impossible, since $a$ is assumed to be even, and this leads to $2a = 2p$ with $p$ odd.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to break down the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question. The user wants to prove that any even integer n, which is not a power of two (so n ≠ 2^k), can be expressed as the sum of more than two consecutive positive integers. They also mentioned counting the number of ways this can be done, but the main focus seems to be on proving the expressibility. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions clearly. The original problem states \"all even n ≠ 2^k are a sum of consecutive integers\" and mentions that the sum should consist of more than two positive consecutive integers. The example given is 14 = 2+3+4+5 and 84 = 9+...+15. So the key points here are:\n\n1. The number n is even.\n2. n is not a power of two.\n3. The sum must consist of more than two consecutive positive integers.\n\nWait, the problem statement says \"more than 2 positive consecutive integer\" which I think means the sum has to have at least two terms, but wait, the example 14 is 2+3+4+5 which is four terms. The original problem's title says \"and counting the ways,\" but the user's main question is about proving the expressibility. \n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is an even integer.\n- n is not equal to 2^k for any integer k.\n- The sum consists of consecutive positive integers.\n- The number of terms in the sum is more than one (since the example has four terms). Wait, the problem says \"more than 2 positive consecutive integer\"—wait, maybe the problem requires the sum to have more than two terms? The user wrote \"more than 2 positive consecutive integer,\" which might be a translation issue. The original example for 14 uses four terms. So the correct interpretation is that the sum must consist of at least two consecutive integers, but the problem says \"more than 2\"—maybe the user meant more than one term? Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. Wait, looking back at the problem statement in the user's question: \"more than 2 positive consecutive integer\"—maybe it's a typo and they meant \"two or more,\" but the example given for 14 is 4 terms, and 84 is 7 terms. The original problem's title says \"All even n ≠ 2^k are a sum of consecutive integers (and counting the ways).\" So perhaps the key is that n is even and not a power of two, and the sum is of consecutive integers (more than one term). The user's problem statement in their question says \"more than 2 positive consecutive integer\"—probably a mistake, and they meant \"more than one\" or \"two or more.\" Because a sum of two consecutive integers would be k + (k+1) = 2k + 1, which is odd. So if n is even, then a sum of two consecutive integers would have to be odd, which can't be. Therefore, perhaps the user requires the sum to have more than two terms. Because otherwise, for even n, you can't write it as two consecutive integers. So the problem likely requires the sum to consist of more than two consecutive integers. \n\nSo, putting this together, the assumptions should be:\n\n- n is an even integer.\n- n is not a power of two (i.e., there's no integer k such that n = 2^k).\n- The sum consists of consecutive positive integers.\n- The number of terms in the sum is more than two.\n\nWait, but the original problem's example for 14 is 2+3+4+5 (four terms). If the user requires \"more than 2\" terms, then that's three or more. So the problem is to express even n (not a power of two) as a sum of at least two consecutive integers. But the example uses four terms. However, in the problem statement, the user wrote \"more than 2 positive consecutive integer\"—maybe they meant the number of integers in the sum is more than two. So each sum must have three or more terms. That makes sense because if you have two terms, as I said earlier, the sum would be odd. So for even n, you need at least three terms. Hence, the problem is: Prove that every even integer n not equal to 2^k can be written as the sum of three or more consecutive positive integers.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n1. n is an even integer.\n2. n is not a power of two.\n3. The sum consists of consecutive positive integers.\n4. The number of consecutive integers in the sum is at least three.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user may not explicitly state all of these, but we need to extract the necessary assumptions from the original question. The original question says: \"any even integer n ≠ 2^k is expressible as a sum of positive consecutive integers ( more than 2 positive consecutive integer)\"—so \"more than 2\" here refers to the number of terms. So the problem requires the sum to have more than two terms. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- n is an even integer.\n- n ≠ 2^k for any integer k.\n- The sum consists of consecutive positive integers.\n- The sum has more than two terms.\n\nBut when structuring the problem, we need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption: n is an even integer.\n\nAssumption: n is not a power of two.\n\nAssumption: The sum consists of consecutive positive integers.\n\nAssumption: The sum has more than two terms.\n\nBut perhaps the problem's main focus is on n being even and not a power of two, and the sum being of consecutive integers (with the condition of more than two terms). However, in the example given by the user (the previous problem), they included \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the user structured it with assumption n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But actually, in the original problem, the user had written \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, they listed assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that's not correct because the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7. That seems like an error in the example. So perhaps the example is not a good model. Therefore, maybe the user wants to list all the explicit conditions given in the problem. \n\nIn the current problem, the user's original question says: \"any even integer n ≠ 2^k is expressible as a sum of positive consecutive integers (more than 2 positive consecutive integer)\". So the conditions are:\n\n- n is even.\n- n is not a power of two.\n- The sum is of consecutive positive integers.\n- The sum has more than two terms.\n\nTherefore, each of these should be listed as assumptions. However, \"the sum is of consecutive positive integers\" is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Wait, perhaps the assumptions are the given conditions on n. Because in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems conflicting. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", which includes all integers, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. So maybe there was a mistake in that example. Therefore, perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions should only include the conditions on n, which are that n is even and not a power of two. The requirement that the sum is of more than two consecutive integers is part of the problem statement. \n\nSo, perhaps the correct assumptions are:\n\n- n is an even integer.\n- n is not a power of two.\n\nAnd the problem is to prove that n can be expressed as a sum of more than two consecutive positive integers.\n\nBut let me check the example again. The original problem in the example was:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut that seems incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should just be n is an integer. Adding \"n is divisible by 7\" is a mistake. Therefore, perhaps the example is flawed, and the user's instruction is to filter out unrelated information and structure the problem correctly. So in the current problem, the user's question is about proving that any even n not equal to 2^k can be expressed as a sum of consecutive integers (with more than two terms). So the key conditions are n is even and n is not a power of two. The part about the sum having more than two terms is part of the problem statement, not an assumption on n. So the assumptions should be:\n\n- n is an even integer.\n- n is not a power of two.\n\nAnd the problem is to prove that n can be expressed as a sum of more than two consecutive positive integers.\n\nAlternatively, if the \"more than two terms\" is considered a condition, maybe it's listed as an assumption. But perhaps in the problem statement, it's part of the requirement. Let me see the original question again:\n\n\"How do I prove that any even integer n ≠ 2^k is expressible as a sum of positive consecutive integers ( more than 2 positive consecutive integer)?\"\n\nSo the problem is to prove that any even integer (not a power of two) can be written as a sum of more than two consecutive positive integers. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- n is an even integer.\n- n ≠ 2^k for any integer k.\n\nAnd the problem is to prove that n can be expressed as a sum of more than two consecutive positive integers.\n\nThus, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption: n is an even integer.\n\nAssumption: n is not a power of two.\n\nProblem: Prove that n is expressible as a sum of more than two consecutive positive integers.\n\nBut the example given by the user included in the problem line the expression with the formula. In the current problem, the user's example shows that they included the mathematical expression in the problem line. However, in this case, the problem is to prove existence, so maybe it's phrased as:\n\nProblem: Prove that any even integer n ≠ 2^k can be expressed as the sum of more than two consecutive positive integers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem line should include the representation as a sum. Let me check the original question's exact wording: \"How do I prove that any even integer n ≠ 2^k is expressible as a sum of positive consecutive integers ( more than 2 positive consecutive integer)?\"\n\nSo the problem is to prove that n can be expressed as a sum where the number of terms is more than two. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: n is an even integer.\n\nAssumption: n is not a power of two.\n\nProblem: Prove that n is expressible as a sum of positive consecutive integers with more than two terms.\n\nBut perhaps the problem statement should mirror the original question's phrasing. The user's example had the problem line as \"Prove that [formula] is divisible by 91.\" So here, it would be \"Prove that any even integer n ≠ 2^k is expressible as a sum of more than two consecutive positive integers.\"\n\nTherefore, putting it all together, the assumptions are n is even and not a power of two, and the problem is to prove expressibility as a sum of more than two consecutive positive integers.",
