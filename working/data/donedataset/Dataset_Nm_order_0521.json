    "Content": "I believe that category theory is one of the most fundamental theories of mathematics, and is becoming a fundamental theory for other sciences as well. It allows us to understand many concepts on a higher, unified level. Categorical methods are general, but of course they can be applied to specific categories and thereby help us to solve specific problems. I am not asking for canonical applications in which category theory is used. I have read all answers to similar math.SE questions on applications of category theory, but they don't fit to my question below. I would like to ask for applications of the notions of \"category\", \"functor\", and \"natural transformation\" (perhaps also \"limit\" and \"adjunction\") , which go beyond descriptions, but really solve specific problems in an elegant way. I am aware of many, many proofs of theorems which have category-theoretic enhancements, in particular by means of the Yoneda Lemma, but I'm not looking for these kind of applications either. So my question is (even though I know that this is not the task of category theory): Can you name a specific and rather easy to understand theorem, whose statement naturally does not contain any categorical notions, but whose proof introduces a suitable category / functor / natural transformation in a crucial way and uses some basic category theory? The proof should not just depend on a large theory (such as arithmetic geometry) whose development has used category theory over decades. The proof should not just be a categorical version of a proof which was already known. So here is an example of this kind, taken from Hartig's wonderful paper \"The Riesz Representation Theorem Revisited\", and hopefully there are more of them: Let $X$ be a compact Hausdorff space, $M(X)$ the Banach space of Borel measures on $X$ and $C(X)^*$ the dual of the Banach space of continuous functions on $X$. Integration provides a linear isometry\n$$\\alpha(X) : M(X) \\to C(X)^*, ~ \\mu \\mapsto \\bigl(f \\mapsto \\int f \\, d\\mu\\bigr).$$\nThe Riesz Representation Theorem asserts that this is an isomorphism. For the \"categorical\" proof, observe first that the maps $\\alpha(X)$ are actually natural, i.e. provide a natural transformation $\\alpha : M \\to C^*$. Using naturality and facts from functional analysis such as the Hahn-Banach Theorem, one shows that if $X$ satisfies the claim and admits a surjective map to $Y$, then $Y$ satisfies the claim. Since every compact Hausdorff space is the quotient of an extremally disconnected space, namely the Stone-Cech-compactification of its underlying set, we may therefore assume that $X$ is extremally disconnected. Now here comes the actual mathematics, and I will just say that there are enough clopen subsets which allow you to construct enough continuous functions. The general case has been reduced to a very easy one, using the concept of natural transformation.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Does the following standard proof of the Brouwer fixed point theorem for the two-dimensional disk $D$ count? Theorem . Any continuous map $f : D \\to D$ has a fixed point. Proof . If $f$ had no fixed point, the map $g : D \\to \\partial D$ given by $g(x) = \\partial D \\cap ($ray from $f(x)$ to $x)$ would be a retraction of $D$ onto $\\partial D$, that is, $g \\circ i = 1_{\\partial D}$  where $i : \\partial D \\to D$ is the inclusion. This implies, by functoriality of $\\pi_1$, that $g_\\ast \\circ i_\\ast = 1_{\\pi_1(\\partial D)}$ which is impossible since $\\pi_1(D) = 0$, $\\pi_1(\\partial D) = \\mathbb{Z}$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this question and structure it according to the required format. The user wants me to act as a math professor who can filter out the unnecessary information from a Math Stack Exchange question and format it with Assumptions and Problem sections. The example given shows that assumptions should list each condition line by line, applied to one object. The problem statement is then simplified.\n\nLooking at the provided example, the original problem was about proving a number is divisible by 91. The formatted version lists assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the user mentions \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like an error. Maybe the example has a mistake? Or perhaps the original problem had more context? Hmm. Well, regardless, I need to focus on the current problem given.\n\nThe current problem is from the Math Stack Exchange question titled \"Honest application of category theory\". The user is asking for specific theorems that don't involve categorical notions in their statement but use category theory (like categories, functors, natural transformations) crucially in their proof. The example given is the Riesz Representation Theorem, where the proof uses naturality of certain transformations and reduces the problem using categorical methods.\n\nThe task is to structure this problem into Assumptions and Problem sections. Let me read through the question again.\n\nThe user states they want a theorem whose statement doesn't contain categorical notions, but whose proof uses category theory in a crucial way. They mention examples like using natural transformations, functors, etc., and specifically refer to the Riesz Representation Theorem proof that uses naturality and reduces the problem via categorical concepts.\n\nSo, what are the assumptions here? Let me break down the problem's requirements. The user is asking for:\n\n1. A specific theorem whose statement does not contain categorical notions.\n2. The theorem's proof must introduce a category, functor, or natural transformation in a crucial way.\n3. The proof shouldn't depend on a large theory developed over decades with category theory.\n4. The proof shouldn't be just a categorical rephrasing of an existing proof.\n5. The example given uses natural transformations and reduces the problem by considering a suitable category.\n\nSo, translating these into the Assumptions section. Each assumption should be a single condition applied to one object. Let's see:\n\nAssumptions could be:\n\n- The theorem's statement does not involve categorical notions.\n- The proof of the theorem uses a category, functor, or natural transformation essentially.\n- The proof does not rely on a large categorical theory.\n- The proof is not merely a categorical reformulation of a known proof.\n\nBut the original problem is phrased as a request for examples. However, the user is asking to structure the problem as per the format. Wait, the example given by the user was a problem where they had to prove a number is divisible by 91, with assumptions on n. But here, the Math Stack Exchange question is a meta-question about applications of category theory. How to structure that?\n\nWait, the user wants to structure the problem presented in the Math Stack Exchange question. The problem is to name a theorem with certain properties. So, the \"Problem\" part would be the actual question asked, and the \"Assumptions\" would be the conditions that the answer must satisfy.\n\nSo, following the example, the assumptions would be the conditions that the theorem must meet. Let me see.\n\nOriginal question asks: Can you name a specific and rather easy to understand theorem, whose statement naturally does not contain any categorical notions, but whose proof introduces a suitable category / functor / natural transformation in a crucial way and uses some basic category theory? The proof should not just depend on a large theory... The proof should not just be a categorical version of a proof which was already known.\n\nSo, the assumptions here are the conditions that the theorem must satisfy:\n\n1. The theorem's statement does not contain categorical notions.\n2. The theorem's proof introduces a category, functor, or natural transformation crucially.\n3. The proof uses basic category theory.\n4. The proof does not depend on a large theory developed with category theory over decades.\n5. The proof is not a categorical version of a previously known proof.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. But in the example, the assumptions were about the objects in the problem (n being an integer, etc.). Here, the problem is a meta-question about finding a theorem with certain proof properties. So maybe the assumptions need to be about the theorem and its proof.\n\nBut the example's assumptions were properties of the problem's variables. Here, the problem is a request for a theorem that meets certain criteria. Therefore, the assumptions would be the criteria that the answer must meet.\n\nTherefore, structuring the problem as follows:\n\nAssumption:\nThe theorem's statement does not contain categorical notions,\nThe theorem's proof uses a category, functor, or natural transformation in a crucial way,\nThe proof uses basic category theory,\nThe proof does not depend on a large theory developed using category theory over decades,\nThe proof is not a categorical version of a previously known proof.\n\nProblem:\nCan you name a specific and easy-to-understand theorem, meeting the above assumptions, where the proof crucially uses categorical notions like category, functor, or natural transformation?\n\nBut the original problem is phrased as a question. However, in the example, the problem was a statement to prove. So perhaps we need to rephrase the question as a problem statement.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n...\", and the formatted problem was \"Prove that A(n)... is divisible by 91\" with assumptions listed. So perhaps here, the problem is \"Can you name a specific theorem...\", but structured as a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to take the core of the problem, removing the discussion. The user wants to structure the actual mathematical problem, not the meta-question. But the example given includes a meta-question about applications of category theory. Wait, the example given by the user was about divisibility by 91, but here the question is about category theory applications.\n\nWait, the example given by the user in their initial prompt was:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut wait, in the original problem, the user says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Unless perhaps the original problem had a typo or the example was incorrect. Maybe the user made a mistake in the example.\n\nBut regardless, the current task is to process the given Math Stack Exchange question about category theory. Let me try to apply the format.\n\nThe problem is to find a theorem as described. So the assumptions would be the conditions required for the theorem's proof, and the problem is to name such a theorem. But perhaps in the context of the problem, the \"assumptions\" are the criteria for the theorem, and the problem is the question itself.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to structure the example given in the question. The user mentions the Riesz Representation Theorem as an example where the proof uses natural transformations. So, perhaps they want to structure that example as a problem?\n\nWait, the original question includes an example of the Riesz Representation Theorem. Let me check:\n\nThe question states: \"Let $X$ be a compact Hausdorff space... The Riesz Representation Theorem asserts that [the map] is an isomorphism. For the 'categorical' proof, observe first that the maps α(X) are actually natural... The general case has been reduced to a very easy one, using the concept of natural transformation.\"\n\nSo the problem here is to prove that α(X) is an isomorphism, with assumptions on X. However, the original problem is a meta-question, but the example within the question is a specific theorem. Maybe the user wants to structure that example as a problem, similar to the divisibility example.\n\nIn that case, the example given in the question is about proving that α(X): M(X) → C(X)* is an isomorphism, using category theory. So the problem would be to prove that α(X) is an isomorphism, with assumptions like X is a compact Hausdorff space, etc.\n\nBut in the example provided by the user, the assumptions are about n being an integer and divisible by 7. So here, for the Riesz theorem, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a compact Hausdorff space,\nM(X) is the Banach space of Borel measures on X,\nC(X)* is the dual of the Banach space of continuous functions on X,\nIntegration provides a linear isometry α(X): M(X) → C(X)*,\nEvery compact Hausdorff space is a quotient of an extremally disconnected space.\n\nProblem:\nProve that α(X) is an isomorphism.\n\nBut I need to follow the user's example structure, where assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So for the Riesz example:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a compact Hausdorff space,\nM(X) is the Banach space of Borel measures on X,\nC(X) is the Banach space of continuous functions on X,\nC(X)* is the dual space of C(X),\nα(X) is the linear isometry defined by integration against measures,\nEvery compact Hausdorff space is a quotient of an extremally disconnected space.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the linear isometry α(X): M(X) → C(X)* is an isomorphism.\n\nBut in the original example, the problem was restated concisely. The user's instruction is to filter out unrelated information and structure the problem with assumptions and problem.\n\nBut the original question on Math Stack Exchange is asking for such theorems, not to prove the Riesz theorem. However, within the question, they present the Riesz theorem as an example of such a problem. So perhaps the user wants us to extract the Riesz theorem problem from the question and structure it.\n\nAlternatively, if the task is to format the entire Math Stack Exchange question into the assumption-problem structure, but the question is a meta-question about applications of category theory. This is confusing because the example given by the user was a mathematical problem, but here the question is about finding examples of such problems.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, perhaps the intended approach is to take the specific example provided within the question (the Riesz Representation Theorem) and structure that as a problem, following the example's format.\n\nSo, focusing on the Riesz example:\n\nOriginal problem in the question: Prove that α(X) is an isomorphism (i.e., the Riesz Representation Theorem), using categorical methods like natural transformations.\n\nAssumptions would be the conditions given in the problem statement:\n\n- X is a compact Hausdorff space.\n- M(X) is the space of Borel measures.\n- C(X)* is the dual space of continuous functions.\n- The map α(X) is defined by integration.\n- Every compact Hausdorff space is a quotient of an extremally disconnected space.\n\nProblem: Prove that α(X) is an isomorphism.\n\nBut in the example provided by the user, the assumptions included conditions on the variables (n is integer, n divisible by 7). Similarly, here, the assumptions would be about X and the structures involved.\n\nHowever, in the original problem statement in the question, the user mentions that the proof uses naturality and reduces the problem by considering surjective maps and extremally disconnected spaces. So perhaps the assumptions also include the existence of such a surjective map?\n\nWait, the example in the problem says: \"if X satisfies the claim and admits a surjective map to Y, then Y satisfies the claim. Since every compact Hausdorff space is the quotient of an extremally disconnected space... we may therefore assume X is extremally disconnected.\"\n\nSo the key assumptions are:\n\n- X is compact Hausdorff.\n- The natural transformation α is used.\n- The proof uses the fact that any compact Hausdorff space is a quotient of an extremally disconnected space.\n\nBut to structure this as per the example, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a compact Hausdorff space,\nM(X) is the Banach space of Borel measures on X,\nC(X)^* is the dual Banach space of continuous functions on X,\nα(X): M(X) → C(X)^* is a linear isometry defined by integration,\nEvery compact Hausdorff space is a quotient of an extremally disconnected space.\n\nProblem:\nProve that α(X) is an isomorphism.\n\nBut I need to ensure each assumption is a single property applied to one object. For example, \"X is a compact Hausdorff space\" is one assumption. \"α(X) is a linear isometry defined by integration\" is another. \"Every compact Hausdorff space is a quotient of an extremally disconnected space\" is another assumption.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would list these assumptions and then the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, the original problem in the example included an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem. That might have been a mistake. But in the current case, the Riesz theorem's assumptions as presented in the question include that X is compact Hausdorff, etc.\n\nTherefore, following this structure, the answer should present the Riesz Representation Theorem as the problem, with the assumptions listed.",
