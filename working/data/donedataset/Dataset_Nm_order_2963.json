    "Content": "I was presented with a proof of the following fact and am hung up on a detail which I think is in fact wrong. Also I think I can fill the detail myself but need a bit of help. Let $X\\subset k^{m}$ and $Y\\subset k^{n}$ be affine varieties(Assumed irreducible). Show that the product $X\\times Y\\subset k^{m+n}$ (equipped with the Zariski topology on $k^{m+n}$) is irreducible. This is the \"proof\". Assume $X\\times Y$ is reducible. Then there exists $Z_{1}$ and $Z_{2}$ closed such that $X\\times Y=Z_{1}\\cup Z_{2}$. Define $X_{i}=\\{x|x\\times Y\\subset Z_{i}\\}$. The proof shows $X=X_{1}\\cup X_{2}$ then says $X_{i}$ is closed because projection is a closed map. I don't think projection of the product under the zariski topology is a closed map. So can someone possibly explain that to me? My idea on showing $X_{i}$ was closed was to show that $X_{i}=\\cap_{y\\in Y}\\{x|(x,y)\\in Z_{i}\\}$ is a closed set. Which amounts to showing $\\{x|(x,y)\\in Z_{i}\\}$ is closed in $X$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Fix $y \\in Y$. The map $X \\to X \\times Y, x \\mapsto (x,y)$ is continuous (in fact it is a morphism). Hence, the preimage $\\{x : (x,y) \\in Z_i\\}$ is closed. Since closed sets are stable under arbitrary intersections, it follows that $\\{x \\in X : x \\times Y \\subseteq Z_i\\}$ is closed.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this Math Stack Exchange question. The user is asking about proving that the product of two affine varieties is irreducible. They mention a specific proof they were presented with, but they have doubts about a detail. The main point of contention is whether the projection map used in the proof is closed in the Zariski topology. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement from the original question. Let's break down the original problem. The user states that X and Y are affine varieties, and they're assumed irreducible. The task is to show that the product X×Y in k^{m+n} with the Zariski topology is irreducible. \n\nThe \"proof\" provided assumes X×Y is reducible, leading to closed sets Z₁ and Z₂ whose union is X×Y. Then, defining X_i as {x | x×Y ⊂ Z_i}, the proof claims X = X₁ ∪ X₂ and that X_i are closed because projection is a closed map. The user questions whether projection in Zariski is closed, suggesting an alternative approach using intersections over y in Y of {x | (x,y) ∈ Z_i}, which should be closed in X.\n\nNow, to structure this into the required format. The assumptions should list each condition per line, applied to one object. The problem statement is to show X×Y is irreducible.\n\nWait, the original problem states X and Y are affine varieties (irreducible). So the assumptions are that X is an affine variety in k^m, Y is an affine variety in k^n, both are irreducible. The problem is to prove their product is irreducible.\n\nIn the user's question, they mention that in the given proof, X_i are defined as {x | x×Y ⊂ Z_i}, and then X is the union of X₁ and X₂. The user's doubt is about whether projection being a closed map is valid here, and they suggest an alternative approach using intersections. So maybe the original problem's assumptions are just that X and Y are irreducible affine varieties, and the problem is to show X×Y is irreducible. The rest of the text is the user's confusion about a specific step in a proof they encountered, but the core problem to be structured is the initial question: Show that the product of two irreducible affine varieties is irreducible.\n\nSo the key assumptions are:\n\n- X is an affine variety in k^m.\n- Y is an affine variety in k^n.\n- X is irreducible.\n- Y is irreducible.\n\nAnd the problem is to prove that X×Y is irreducible as a subset of k^{m+n} with the Zariski topology.\n\nI should check if there are any other implicit assumptions. The user mentions \"affine varieties\" which in algebraic geometry are irreducible by some definitions, but the problem explicitly states \"assumed irreducible,\" so that's part of the assumptions. The field k isn't specified, but typically in algebraic geometry, especially with Zariski topology, k is algebraically closed, but since the user didn't specify, maybe we shouldn't assume that unless necessary. However, the problem as posed might not require k to be algebraically closed. The key is that X and Y are irreducible affine varieties.\n\nSo the structured problem should list each assumption separately. Let me put that together.",
