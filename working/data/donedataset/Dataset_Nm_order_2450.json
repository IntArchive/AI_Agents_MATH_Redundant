    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to format a math problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified structure. The original question is about proving that three complex points form an equilateral triangle given a certain equation.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The problem states three complex numbers z1, z2, z3 and the condition z1² + z2² + z3² = z1z2 + z1z3 + z2z3. The goal is to prove they form an equilateral triangle. \n\nIn the example provided, assumptions were listed as separate points. Here, the key conditions are that z1, z2, z3 are complex numbers and that the equation holds. Since the problem doesn't mention any restrictions like the triangle being non-degenerate or specific orientations, maybe those are implicit? But the original problem doesn't specify, so I should stick to what's given. \n\nWait, sometimes in geometry problems, especially with complex numbers, assuming the points are distinct is important. But the original question doesn't mention that. Should I include it as an assumption? The example didn't add extra assumptions beyond what was given. The user's example for divisibility included an assumption about n being an integer and divisible by 7, even though the original problem just said \"for every integer n\". Hmm, maybe in that example, the user made a mistake? Wait, looking back: the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect. The original problem says to prove it for every integer n, but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be an error. Maybe the user intended a different problem. But regardless, in this current problem, the user wants to structure the given question as per the format.\n\nSo, the original question states that given three complex numbers z1, z2, z3, prove they form an equilateral triangle if z1² + z2² + z3² = z1z2 + z1z3 + z2z3. So the assumptions here are:\n\n1. z1, z2, z3 are complex numbers.\n2. The equation z1² + z2² + z3² = z1z2 + z1z3 + z2z3 holds.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the assumption was split into separate lines for each property. So here, the three complex numbers being vertices is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Wait, the problem is to prove that given the equation, the points form an equilateral triangle. So the assumptions are the premises given. So the equation is the main assumption. The fact that z1, z2, z3 are complex numbers is also an assumption.\n\nBut maybe the user wants each assumption as a separate line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nEach of z₁, z₂, z₃ is a complex number,\nThe equation z₁² + z₂² + z₃² = z₁z₂ + z₁z₃ + z₂z₃ is satisfied.\n\nProblem: Prove that the points z₁, z₂, z₃ are vertices of an equilateral triangle in ℂ.\n\nWait, but the problem as stated in the original question says \"prove that the points z₁, z₂, z₃ are vertices of an equilateral triangle in ℂ\" given the equation. So the assumptions are the equation and that they are complex numbers. But in complex plane, points are naturally complex numbers, so maybe the first assumption is redundant. However, to be thorough, maybe it's better to list both.\n\nAlternatively, in the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So perhaps the example was incorrect, but following that structure, here we need to list all explicit assumptions. The original problem says \"Given three complex numbers z₁, z₂, z₃\", so that is an assumption. Then the equation is another assumption. So each should be a separate line.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nz₁, z₂, z₃ are complex numbers,\nz₁² + z₂² + z₃² = z₁z₂ + z₁z₃ + z₂z₃.\n\nProblem: Prove that the points z₁, z₂, z₃ form an equilateral triangle in ℂ.\n\nBut the original problem says \"are vertices of an equilateral triangle in ℂ\", so I should mirror that wording.\n\nAlso, check if there's any other implicit assumptions. For example, the triangle being non-degenerate? But the problem doesn't mention that, so maybe it's not required. The equation might inherently ensure that the points are distinct? Not sure. But unless specified, we shouldn't add assumptions. So stick to what's given.",
