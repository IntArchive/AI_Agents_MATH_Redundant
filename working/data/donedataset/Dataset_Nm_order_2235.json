    "Content": "This is a really easy question, but I'm stuck in the logic of it... Let $F$ be an integral domain and $F[x]$ its polynomial ring. Let $a\\in F$ fixed, define $\\phi: F[x]\\to F$ as $\\phi(p(x))=p(a)$. Prove that $\\phi$ is a homomorphism. I daresay this is trivial and follows from its own definition... but I'm not sure. I'm seeing it as a \"change of variable\" or something like that. So I ask... what would be the argument? Thanks a lot, I'm sorry for this easy one.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here is a modified version of a proof I found on an old website, the link to which seems to have expired: Let $f(x) = a_nx^n + \\ldots + a_0x^0$ , and $g(x) = b_nx^n+ \\ldots + b_0x^0$ , where the $a_i,b_i ∈ \\mathbb F$ , and let $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{F}$ be the field element we wish to evaluate the polynomials on. (We'll also allow leading coefficients to be zero in order to make it easier to add $f$ and $g$ formally.) We then check the ring homomorphism conditions: We have: $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\phi(f+g) &=\\phi((a_n+b_n)x^n + \\ldots + (a_0 + b_0)x^0) \\\\\n&= (a_n + b_n)\\alpha^n + \\ldots + (a_0 + b_0)\\alpha^0 \\\\\n&= (a_n\\alpha^n + \\ldots + a_0\\alpha^0) + (b_n\\alpha^n + \\ldots + b_0\\alpha^0) \\\\\n&=\\phi(f) + \\phi(g)\n\\end{aligned}$$ So $\\phi$ is an additive group homomorphism. Since we know that $\\phi$ is an additive homomorphism, we only need to check that it is multiplicative on monomials. But that's easy: $$\\phi((ax^n)(bx^m))=\\phi(abx^{n+m}) = ab\\alpha^{n+m}=\\phi(ax^n)\\phi(bx^m)$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The question is about proving that the evaluation map φ: F[x] → F defined by φ(p(x)) = p(a) is a ring homomorphism. Here, F is an integral domain, and a is a fixed element in F. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what a ring homomorphism is. A ring homomorphism between two rings R and S is a function f: R → S that preserves the ring operations. Specifically, for any two elements r, s in R, the following must hold:\n1. f(r + s) = f(r) + f(s)\n2. f(r * s) = f(r) * f(s)\n3. f(1_R) = 1_S, where 1_R and 1_S are the multiplicative identities in R and S, respectively.\n\nIn this case, the rings involved are F[x] (the polynomial ring over F) and F itself. The evaluation map φ takes a polynomial p(x) and evaluates it at a fixed element a in F, resulting in an element of F. So, φ(p(x)) = p(a).\n\nNow, to prove that φ is a ring homomorphism, I need to verify the three properties mentioned above. Let's break them down one by one.\n\nFirst, additivity: φ(p(x) + q(x)) should equal φ(p(x)) + φ(q(x)). Let's take two arbitrary polynomials p(x) and q(x) in F[x]. When we add them, we get (p + q)(x) = p(x) + q(x). Evaluating this sum at a gives (p + q)(a) = p(a) + q(a), which by definition is φ(p(x)) + φ(q(x)). So, the additivity holds.\n\nSecond, multiplicativity: φ(p(x) * q(x)) should equal φ(p(x)) * φ(q(x)). Similarly, taking the product of p(x) and q(x) gives (p * q)(x) = p(x) * q(x). Evaluating this product at a results in (p * q)(a) = p(a) * q(a), which is φ(p(x)) * φ(q(x)). Therefore, multiplicativity also holds.\n\nThird, preservation of multiplicative identity: The multiplicative identity in F[x] is the constant polynomial 1. Evaluating this polynomial at a gives 1(a) = 1, which is the multiplicative identity in F. Hence, φ(1_F[x]) = 1_F.\n\nSince all three properties are satisfied, φ is indeed a ring homomorphism.\n\nWait a second, the problem mentions that F is an integral domain. But integral domains are commutative rings with unity and no zero divisors. However, in the proof above, I didn't use the fact that F is an integral domain. Is there something missing here? Let me think.\n\nPolynomial rings over integral domains are also integral domains. But does that affect the evaluation homomorphism? The evaluation map's homomorphism properties generally hold for any commutative ring with unity. Since F is an integral domain, it's certainly a commutative ring with unity. Therefore, the fact that F is an integral domain might not be necessary for the homomorphism part. Maybe the question just provides context that F is an integral domain, but the homomorphism properties hold more generally. However, the problem statement includes that F is an integral domain, so perhaps we should note that while the proof doesn't rely on F being an integral domain beyond it being a commutative ring with unity, the assumption is given and should be considered. But in the actual steps of the proof, the integral domain property isn't used. So maybe the problem is stated in that context, but the homomorphism holds regardless.\n\nTherefore, the key assumptions here are that F is a ring (specifically an integral domain, which implies it's commutative with unity and no zero divisors), a is fixed in F, and φ is defined as evaluation at a. The problem is to verify the homomorphism properties, which follow from the definitions of polynomial addition and multiplication.",
