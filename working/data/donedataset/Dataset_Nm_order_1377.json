    "Content": "Is there a simple way to show that a positive definite matrix must be Hermitian? I feel there is a long drawn out proof of this to be had by taking unit vectors and applying the positive definiteness property, and brute forcing it. But is there some simple clever proof why a positive definite matrix is necessarily Hermitian?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "As Marvis says in the comments, the problem reduces to showing that if $V$ is a finite-dimensional complex inner product space and $A : V \\to V$ an operator such that $\\langle v, Av \\rangle = 0$ for all $v$, then $A = 0$. Letting $v$ run across all eigenvectors of $A$, the hypothesis implies that $A$ has all eigenvalues $0$, hence is nilpotent. Suppose by contradiction that $A \\neq 0$, hence there exists a vector $v_0$ such that $v_1 = A v_0$ is nonzero. We may assume WLOG that $A v_1 = 0$, hence $$\\langle v_0 + v_1, A(v_0 + v_1) \\rangle = \\langle v_1, v_1 \\rangle \\neq 0$$ which is a contradiction. Hence $A = 0$. Note that the corresponding assertion for real inner product spaces is false; the condition $\\langle v, Av \\rangle = 0$ is satisfied by all skew-symmetric matrices.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to format this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. Let me start by reading through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe title is \"Positive definite matrix must be Hermitian,\" and the user is asking if there's a simple way to prove that a positive definite matrix has to be Hermitian. They mention that a brute force approach using unit vectors and positive definiteness might work, but they're looking for a clever, straightforward proof.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The key points here are:\n\n1. The matrix in question is positive definite. Positive definiteness typically requires that for any non-zero vector x, the product x*Ax is positive (where x* is the conjugate transpose). However, the exact definition might vary, so I need to be precise.\n\nWait, but the problem is about showing that positive definiteness implies the matrix is Hermitian. So the main assumption is that the matrix is positive definite. But wait, is there a standard definition of positive definite that might implicitly include being Hermitian? Hmm, sometimes in some contexts, especially in real matrices, positive definite matrices are symmetric by definition. But in complex matrices, the Hermitian property is often part of the definition. Wait, but the question is stating that a positive definite matrix must be Hermitian, which suggests that maybe the user is using a definition where positive definite doesn't automatically assume Hermitian. So the assumption here is that the matrix is positive definite, perhaps without assuming it's Hermitian, and the problem is to show that it must be Hermitian.\n\nSo the key assumption is that the matrix is positive definite. But let me check the standard definitions. In some contexts, especially in linear algebra over complex numbers, a positive definite matrix is defined as a Hermitian matrix A such that x*Ax > 0 for all non-zero x. But maybe in the user's question, they're considering a more general case where a matrix is called positive definite if x*Ax is real and positive for all non-zero x, without assuming A is Hermitian. Then the problem is to show that this condition forces A to be Hermitian.\n\nTherefore, the assumption here is that the matrix is positive definite, i.e., for every non-zero vector x, x*Ax is a positive real number. The problem is to prove that such a matrix must be Hermitian.\n\nBut wait, are there any other assumptions? For example, the field being complex numbers? Because in real matrices, a positive definite matrix is symmetric, but the question is about Hermitian, which is the complex analog. So maybe the underlying assumption is that the matrix is complex. The user didn't specify, but given that they mention Hermitian (which is a complex concept), it's safe to assume the matrix is over the complex field.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n1. A is a complex matrix.\n2. For every non-zero complex vector x, x*Ax is a positive real number.\n\nThen the problem is to show that A is Hermitian (i.e., A = A* where A* is the conjugate transpose).\n\nWait, but the original question didn't explicitly mention complex vectors. But since Hermitian is a concept in complex matrices, maybe that's implied. Alternatively, if the matrix is real, then Hermitian reduces to symmetric. But the question is phrased generally. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is over complex numbers. So to structure the problem correctly, I should list the assumptions:\n\nAssumptions:\n- A is a square matrix.\n- For every non-zero vector x, the product x*Ax is a positive real number.\n\nProblem: Prove that A is Hermitian.\n\nBut wait, perhaps more precise: The assumption that A is positive definite (which in some definitions includes being Hermitian, but here it's not assumed). So the user is using a definition where positive definite just requires x*Ax > 0 for all x ≠ 0, and then the problem is to show that A must equal its conjugate transpose.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a square matrix over the complex numbers,\nFor every non-zero complex vector x, x*Ax is a positive real number.\n\nProblem: Prove that A is Hermitian.\n\nBut perhaps the field is not specified. Maybe the problem works for both real and complex, but in real case, Hermitian is symmetric. Wait, but the question says \"Hermitian,\" so it's likely referring to complex matrices. So I should include that the matrix is complex. Alternatively, maybe not, but the key is to list all necessary assumptions from the problem as presented.\n\nThe original question doesn't specify the field, but since Hermitian is a term used in complex matrices, the assumption is that we're working over the complex numbers. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. A is a complex matrix.\n2. For every non-zero complex vector x, x*Ax is a positive real number.\n\nProblem: Prove that A is Hermitian.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first assumption is that A is a square matrix (since positive definite applies to square matrices), and the second is the condition on x*Ax. But the user might not have specified square, but that's inherent in the definition of positive definite matrices.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the assumptions are:\n\n- A is a square matrix.\n- For every non-zero vector x, x*Ax is a positive real number.\n\nProblem: Prove that A is Hermitian.\n\nWait, but in real matrices, if A is positive definite (x^T A x > 0 for all real x ≠ 0), then A must be symmetric. So maybe the problem is in the real case, but the user mentions Hermitian, which is the complex version. So the problem is likely in complex matrices. But the original problem doesn't specify, so maybe the answer should assume complex.\n\nHowever, the user's question is about showing that positive definite implies Hermitian, so the key assumptions are that A is a square matrix (probably complex) and x*Ax > 0 for all non-zero x. Thus, the formatted problem would have these assumptions.\n\nWait, but the original example had specific assumptions, like n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem's assumptions are:\n\n1. A is a square matrix (since positive definiteness applies to square matrices).\n2. For every non-zero vector x, x*Ax is a positive real number.\n\nAnd the problem is to prove that A is Hermitian.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's definition of positive definite already includes that A is Hermitian, but the question is challenging that. Hmm. But the user is asking for a proof that positive definite implies Hermitian, so the assumption is that the matrix is positive definite (without assuming Hermitian) and the conclusion is that it must be Hermitian.\n\nTherefore, the correct assumptions are:\n\n- A is a square matrix (over complex numbers).\n- For every non-zero complex vector x, x*Ax is a positive real number.\n\nProblem: Prove that A is Hermitian.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the field is not specified, but given the term Hermitian, it's complex. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a complex square matrix,\nFor every non-zero complex vector x, the product x*Ax is a positive real number.\n\nProblem: Prove that A is Hermitian.\n\nYes, that seems accurate. So the answer should structure it like that.",
