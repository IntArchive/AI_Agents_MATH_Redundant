    "AcceptedAnswer": "William Boothby, An Introduction to Differentiable Manifolds and Riemannian Geometry Rev 2nd ed . At the beginning of ch3. You can find a detailed proof that $\\mathbb RP^n$ admits a differentiable manifold structure over the quotient topology induced by the natural projection $\\pi:\\mathbb R^{n+1}\\to\\mathbb RP^n$. To see it is compact and connected, this is really a topological matter. Restrict the domain of $\\pi$ to $S^n$. According to the definition of quotient topology, $\\pi:\\mathbb R^{n+1}\\to\\mathbb RP^n$ is a surjective continuous map. So $\\pi|_{S^n}:S^n\\to\\mathbb RP^n$ with $S^n$ equipped with subspace topology is also a surjective continuous map. Surjectivity of $\\pi|_{S^n}$ comes from the fact that $\\forall [x_0,x_1,\\dots,x_n]\\in\\mathbb RP^n$ has in its preimage a point $(x_0,\\dots,x_n)/(\\sum_{i=0}^nx_i^2)^{1/2}\\in S^n$. Therefore. it preserves compactness and connectedness. So $\\mathbb RP^n$ is compact and connected since $S^n$ is. Appendix: $S^n$ is compact, since it is closed and bounded in $\\mathbb R^{n+1}$ by Heine-Borel theorem. $S^n$ is path connected: any two points can be connected by an arc on a great circle. So it is also connected. (path connectedness implies connectedness). All the topological facts can be picked up in James Munkres's Topology 2nd ed . Or you can find a quick review in Abraham, Marsden, Ratiu, Manifolds, Tensor Analysis and Applications (2007 draft recommended).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to format this Math Stack Exchange question according to the user's instructions. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the problem into Assumptions and Problem sections based on the example provided.\n\nFirst, I need to read the original problem carefully. The title is \"A proof of compactness, connectedness of real projective space.\" The question is asking for a reference that provides a complete proof that RP^n (n-dimensional real projective space) is a compact and connected manifold under the standard topology over R. The user also mentions they want a non-complicated proof.\n\nLooking at the example given, the Assumptions section lists each condition applied to one object. In the example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. Each assumption is a single property per line.\n\nSo for this problem, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem is about RP^n. The key properties here are that RP^n is the n-dimensional real projective space, and it's considered with the standard topology over R. The problem is to prove it's a compact and connected manifold.\n\nBreaking down the assumptions:\n1. RP^n is the n-dimensional real projective space. This defines the object in question.\n2. The topology on RP^n is the standard topology. Since the problem mentions \"standard topology over R,\" but RP^n is a quotient space of R^(n+1)\\{0}, the standard topology here would refer to the quotient topology induced from the real space.\n3. The problem is in the context of the standard topology over R, which is the real numbers with their usual topology. However, since RP^n is a quotient space, the topology is inherited from that construction.\n\nEach assumption should be a single line addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So, the assumptions would be:\n\n- $RP^n$ is the $n$-dimensional real projective space.\n- $RP^n$ is endowed with the standard topology.\n- The standard topology is over $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nWait, but the third one might be redundant because the standard topology on RP^n is inherently over R. Maybe the problem states \"standard topology over R\" to specify the base field or space. But in the original question, it's written as \"Consider the standard topology over R\". So the user is specifying that the topology is the standard one on the real numbers. However, RP^n is a manifold built from real space, so the topology is indeed based on R. \n\nTherefore, the assumptions should include that the topology considered is the standard one over R. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n- $RP^n$ is the $n$-dimensional real projective space.\n- $RP^n$ is considered with the standard topology over $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that RP^n is a compact, connected manifold.\n\nI need to check if there are any other implicit assumptions. The original question doesn't specify any particular conditions on n, like n being a positive integer or something. But in the context of real projective space, n is typically a non-negative integer (usually positive). However, since the problem doesn't explicitly state any restrictions on n, maybe we shouldn't include that unless it's in the original problem. The original question just says \"n-dimensional real projective space\", so n is an integer, probably n ≥ 1, but the user didn't mention that. Since the example only included what was stated, perhaps we should not assume n's properties unless specified. The original problem doesn't mention any restrictions on n, so maybe we shouldn't list them. The assumptions are only those explicitly given in the problem.\n\nSo the main assumptions are about the definition of RP^n and the topology. Then the problem is to prove compactness, connectedness, and that it's a manifold.\n\nThus, structuring it:\n\nAssumption:\n$RP^n$ is the $n$-dimensional real projective space,\n$RP^n$ is endowed with the standard topology over $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $RP^n$ is a compact, connected manifold.\n\nWait, but the original problem mentions \"Let $RP^n$ be $n$-dimensional real projective space. Then $RP^n$ is a compact, connected manifold.\" So the assumptions are that RP^n is defined as the n-dimensional real projective space with the standard topology. The problem is to prove compactness, connectedness, and that it's a manifold.\n\nBut the example given had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Similarly, here, the assumptions are the definitions and the topology. So each assumption is a separate line. So:\n\nAssumption:\n$RP^n$ is the $n$-dimensional real projective space,\n$RP^n$ is considered with the standard topology over $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $RP^n$ is a compact, connected manifold.\n\nThat seems correct. Each assumption is a separate line. The first defines the object, the second defines the topology. The problem is to prove the three properties: compact, connected, manifold.",
