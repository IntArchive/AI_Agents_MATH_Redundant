    "Content": "$\\mathbb R^2$ carries the Euclidean topology. Question: Does there exist a subset $A$ of $\\mathbb R^2$ , which is homeomorphic to the half open interval $[0, 1)$ , and which separates the plane, i.e. $\\mathbb R^2 \\setminus A$ is not connected? Notes The most obvious $A$ , which are homeomorphic to $[0, 1)$ do not separate the plane, for instance $[0, 1) \\times \\{0\\}$ , $[0, \\infty) \\times \\{0\\}$ , subsets of the circle etc. ( removed, see below ) If $A$ is homeomorphic to the open interval $(0,1)$ , instead,\nthere are trivial examples, which separate the plane (e.g., the $x$ -axis), or not (e.g., $(0,1) \\times \\{0\\}$ ). If $A$ is homeomorphic to the closed interval $[0,1]$ , instead, it never separates the plane. This is the Jordan arc theorem, for instance see here for a short and elegant proof based on the Brouwer fixed-point-theorem. In fact, all proofs, which I am aware of, are non-trivial! If the answer to the question is \"no\", I would therefore expect, that its proof is also non-trivial. Or, perhaps, it can be deduced from the Jordan arc theorem? There are a lot of results in the literature dealing with compact sets separating or not separating the plane (for instance, the famous Jordan curve theorem). But I haven't found anything relevant to non-compact sets.\nTherefore, I would also appreciate references in this direction. Is it of any relevance to assume that $A$ is bounded or unbounded? Note that subsets separating the plane need not contain closed curves, for instance the Warsaw circle . But, of course, the Warsaw circle is not homeomorphic to $[0,1)$ . Update I was wrong with my Note 2., where I stated that a dense $A$ homeomorphic to $[0, 1)$ exists.\nTherefore I delete 2. Of course, this does not influence the question itself. the comments so far show that there are A such that $\\mathbb R^2 \\setminus A$ is not path connected. But all the examples so far don't seem to answer the question.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I think the following works. More generally, I think it shows (with a little extra work) that an embedding of $(0,1)$ can only split the plane into two components if the end points are at infinity (i.e. it extends to an embedding of $S^1$ in $S^2$ containing $\\infty$ ). Theorem. There is no embedding of $[0,1)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ that separates the plane into two (or more) connected components. Let $\\gamma:[0,1)\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^2$ be an embedding, and let $C$ be its image. We say that $C$ locally splits the plane into $n$ components at $c\\in C$ if every neighbordhood of $c$ contains neighborhood $N$ of $c$ homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^2$ such that $N-C$ has $n$ components. The idea is that for each $t$ , $C$ locally splits the plane into either $1$ or $2$ components near $\\gamma(t)$ , depending on whether $t=0$ or $t>0$ . Connectivity of $C$ allows us to stitch up these neighborhoods, which shows that all local components of $\\mathbb{R}^2-C$ near $C$ are part of the same global component $\\Gamma$ . But the global components of $\\mathbb{R}^2-C$ containing $\\gamma(t)$ as a limit point are precisely those that show up (as a subset) as a local component near $\\gamma(t)$ . Thus, $C\\subset\\overline{\\Gamma}$ and and $C$ is disjoint from the closures of all other components of $\\mathbb{R}^2-C$ . In fact, $C\\subset\\overline{\\Gamma}$ implies $\\overline{C}\\subset\\overline{\\Gamma}$ , so $\\overline{C}-C\\subset\\Gamma$ . However, each component of $\\mathbb{R}^2-C$ must have boundary contained in $\\overline{C}$ , so it is not possible for there to be another component. Moise Ch10 Theorem 13. Every triangulable set in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is tame. Triangulable means homeomorphic to a Euclidean simplicial complex , and tame means ambiently so.\nFor us, this means there is an ambient homoemorphism of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ sending $C$ to an infinite polygonal chain $P$ with exactly one endpoint. Since $C$ is an embedding, so is $P$ , so WLOG, we can assume $\\gamma$ is piece-wise linear. Lemma 1. $C$ locally splits the plane into $1$ or $2$ components near $\\gamma(t)$ , depending on whether $t=0$ or $t>0$ , respectively. By Moise, we can assume $C$ is a linear complex. Let $t\\in [0,1)$ , and let $K$ be the union of the edges containing $\\gamma(t)$ . Define $\\varepsilon_t$ to be the minimum distance from $\\gamma(t)$ to a vertex in $K-\\{\\gamma(t)\\}$ . Then, for $\\varepsilon\\leq\\varepsilon_t$ , $N_\\varepsilon\\cap K$ is connected and the image of an open interval $I$ (w.r.t the topology of $[0,1)$ ) under $\\gamma$ . If there are arbitrarily small $\\varepsilon\\leq\\varepsilon_t$ for which $N_\\varepsilon\\cap C$ is disconnected, then there is a sequence $(t_n)$ with $t_n\\not\\in \\gamma^{-1}(K)\\supset I$ such that $\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\gamma(t_n)=\\gamma(t)$ , which contradicts the fact that $\\gamma$ is an embedding. Thus, $N_\\varepsilon\\cap C$ is connected for $\\varepsilon$ sufficiently small. Now within $N_\\varepsilon$ , $K$ is simply the union of two radii when $t>0$ , and one radius when $t=0$ . Thus, $N_\\varepsilon-C=N_\\varepsilon-K$ has one or two components, depending on whether $t=0$ or $t>0$ , respectively. $\\square$ Lemma 2. There is a single connected component $\\Gamma\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}^2-C$ such that every sufficiently small neighborhood of $c\\in C$ has intersection with $\\mathbb{R}^2-C$ contained in $\\Gamma$ . A choice function $f$ taking $t$ to a $N_\\varepsilon$ as in lemma 1 for each $t$ results in a covering of $C$ by $\\{f(t)\\}_{t\\in[0,1)}$ and a covering for $[0,1)$ by $\\{\\gamma^{-1}(f(t))\\}_{t\\in[0,1)}$ . Each point of $f(t)\\cap C$ is a limit point of each of the components of $f(t)-C$ . Thus, each component of $f(t)-C$ must intersect a component of $f(t')-C$ for $t'\\in \\gamma^{-1}(f(t))$ . So on any interval $I$ (i.e. a connected set), the number of connected components of $\\bigcup_{t\\in I}f(t)-C$ cannot exceed the number of connected components of $f(t)-C$ for any $t\\in I$ . In particular, $\\bigcup_{t\\in[0,1)}f(t)-C$ is connected. $\\square$ Edit. I realized, as pointed out in the comments, that I had assumed every $c\\in C$ necessarily had an $\\varepsilon$ -neighborhood with connected intersection with $C$ . This does not seem to be trivial, or necessarily true. I have remedied this with Moise's theorem on the tameness of triangulable manifold embeddings in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ , which made using Hatcher 2B.1 unnecessary.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to break down this problem step by step. The user is asking whether a subset A of the plane, which is homeomorphic to the half-open interval [0,1), can separate the plane, meaning that the complement of A in R² is not connected. \n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand the question correctly. A space separates the plane if its complement has at least two connected components. The problem is about finding such a set A that's homeomorphic to [0,1), or proving that it's impossible. \n\nThe user mentions some examples: [0,1) x {0} doesn't separate the plane because removing a line segment from the plane still leaves it connected. Similarly, a half-line like [0, ∞) x {0} also doesn't separate the plane. On the other hand, if A were homeomorphic to (0,1), like the x-axis, it does separate the plane into upper and lower half-planes. But since A here is homeomorphic to [0,1), which includes an endpoint, maybe that affects things?\n\nThe user also refers to the Jordan arc theorem, which states that a closed arc (homeomorphic to [0,1]) doesn't separate the plane. So closed arcs don't separate, but open arcs (like the x-axis) do. The question is about the half-open case. \n\nI need to think about whether such a set A can exist. Let's consider examples. Suppose we take a spiral that starts at a point and winds out to infinity. Such a spiral is homeomorphic to [0,1) because it's a ray starting at a point. Would removing this spiral disconnect the plane? Probably not, because the spiral is a single curve going to infinity; the complement might still be path-connected by going around the spiral. \n\nAnother idea: Maybe take a set that accumulates on itself. For example, a topologist's sine curve. But that's compact, so not homeomorphic to [0,1). Alternatively, consider a curve that is not properly embedded, like a line that accumulates on some region. However, such a set might not be homeomorphic to [0,1) because [0,1) is a 1-manifold with boundary, and if the accumulation point is in the plane, the neighborhood around that point wouldn't look like a half-open interval.\n\nWait, the key property of [0,1) is that it's a 1-dimensional manifold with boundary. So any embedding of [0,1) into R² must be a subspace that is locally homeomorphic to [0,1). That means each point in A must have a neighborhood in A that looks like an open interval or a half-open interval. So, for the endpoint 0 in [0,1), its image in A must have a neighborhood homeomorphic to [0,1), i.e., there's a \"starting point\" in A with a neighborhood that only extends in one direction. \n\nIf A is such a space, can it separate the plane? Let's think about the closed arc vs open arc. The open arc (like the x-axis) does separate, but the closed arc doesn't. The half-open case is in between. Maybe if the arc is \"closed\" at the starting point but open at the other end. \n\nSuppose we take a half-open arc that starts at the origin and goes to infinity in some way. For example, take the union of the closed interval [0,1] on the x-axis and then a spiral starting at (1,0) going outwards. But wait, that would be homeomorphic to [0,1) if the spiral is parameterized as t approaching 1. But does such a set separate the plane? The closed part [0,1] on the x-axis doesn't separate the plane, but once you add the spiral, maybe it does. However, the spiral part is a ray going to infinity. Removing the entire set A would split the plane into two parts: above and below the spiral? Not necessarily, because a single spiral doesn't enclose any regions. \n\nAlternatively, think of A as a ray that is dense in some region. But if A is dense, its complement would be disconnected? Wait, dense sets typically have connected complements, but maybe not. For instance, the x-axis is closed and not dense, and its complement is disconnected. If A is dense and homeomorphic to [0,1), but I don't know if such a set exists. The user mentions an update where they realized that a dense A homeomorphic to [0,1) might not exist, so they removed that note. \n\nAnother approach: use the Jordan curve theorem. A Jordan curve (homeomorphic to a circle) separates the plane into two components. But here we have a non-compact set. Maybe use a similar idea. If A is an arc that is not closed, but it's homeomorphic to [0,1), perhaps it can separate the plane. \n\nWait, the x-axis is homeomorphic to R, which is homeomorphic to (0,1), not [0,1). So the x-axis is an open arc. If we take a closed ray, like [0, ∞) on the x-axis, which is homeomorphic to [0,1), removing it doesn't disconnect the plane. But if we can somehow make the ray \"act\" like a separator. Maybe if the ray is not straight. \n\nAlternatively, take a closed ray that is not embedded in a straight line. For example, a ray that spirals out to infinity. Would removing such a spiral disconnect the plane? Probably not, since you can still go around the spiral. \n\nWait, but if you have a spiral that accumulates on a circle, but that would require the spiral to be compact, which it's not. A spiral going out to infinity is homeomorphic to [0,1), but it's not accumulating on any compact set. \n\nHmm. Maybe another approach: Use the fact that a closed arc doesn't separate, but if you remove a point from the closed arc, making it a half-open arc, maybe that can separate. Wait, but the closed arc is [0,1], and removing the endpoint 1 gives [0,1), which is homeomorphic to [0,1). But the original closed arc doesn't separate, so removing a point would make it a half-open arc. Would that now separate? Probably not, because removing a single point from a closed arc (which doesn't separate) results in a space that still doesn't separate. Wait, no. If you have a closed arc in the plane, like a Jordan arc, its complement is connected. If you remove one endpoint from the arc, making it a half-open arc, the complement should still be connected. Because near the missing endpoint, the plane is still connected around that point. \n\nAlternatively, consider embedding the half-open interval in such a way that it accumulates at some point, creating a \"hole\". But since it's homeomorphic to [0,1), every point must have a neighborhood like [0,1). So the accumulation point can't be in the plane; it has to go to infinity. \n\nWait, here's an idea. Take a closed ray (homeomorphic to [0,1)) that is embedded in the plane such that it \"winds\" around a point. For example, consider a ray starting at the origin and spiraling around the origin infinitely many times as it goes to infinity. This ray is homeomorphic to [0,1), but does it separate the plane? If you remove this spiral, the complement has two components: the inside of the spiral and the outside. Wait, but a spiral that winds around the origin infinitely would not enclose any points because it's going to infinity. Each loop of the spiral gets larger and larger, so any point in the plane can be connected to a point outside a sufficiently large loop, so the complement might still be connected. \n\nAlternatively, maybe take a ray that is not properly embedded, like a topologist's sine curve. But the topologist's sine curve is compact, so not homeomorphic to [0,1). \n\nAnother angle: Use the Jordan arc theorem which says that a closed arc doesn't separate the plane. If we have a half-open arc, can we extend it to a closed arc and use the theorem? Suppose A is a half-open arc. If we add the missing endpoint to make it a closed arc, then the complement is connected. Removing the endpoint from the closed arc (which is A) might or might not disconnect the complement. But in the case of the x-axis, removing a closed interval [0,1] doesn't separate, but removing the open interval (0,1) does separate. Wait, no, removing the open interval (0,1) from the x-axis leaves the complement with two half-lines, which are disconnected. But if you remove a closed interval [0,1], the complement is still connected because you can go around the interval. So in that case, removing the open interval disconnects, but removing the closed interval doesn't. \n\nBut in our problem, the set A is homeomorphic to [0,1). If A is like the open interval (0,1) union {0}, which is [0,1), then removing it from the plane would leave the complement. Wait, if A is embedded as the x-axis from [0,1), then removing it would leave the complement. But the x-axis from [0,1) is just a half-open interval on the x-axis. Removing it would not disconnect the plane, because you can go around it. Just like removing a closed interval doesn't disconnect, removing a half-open interval also doesn't. \n\nBut if A is embedded differently, maybe in a way that its closure is a closed arc, and the missing endpoint is a limit point that's not in A. Then removing A would be like removing the closed arc minus a point. But the closed arc doesn't separate, so removing most of it except a point might not separate. \n\nWait, perhaps there's a way to embed [0,1) such that its closure is a closed arc, and the complement of A has two components. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, consider the Alexander horned sphere, but that's in 3D. Not helpful here. \n\nWait, the user mentions the Warsaw circle, which is a compact space that separates the plane but isn't a closed curve. The Warsaw circle is the union of a closed topologist's sine curve and an arc connecting the two ends. But it's compact. However, the user says it's not homeomorphic to [0,1). \n\nSo, maybe there's a non-compact, half-open arc-like set that can separate the plane. \n\nAlternatively, consider a set A that is a ray starting at the origin and going to infinity, but in such a way that it intersects itself infinitely often, creating \"holes\". But a ray homeomorphic to [0,1) can't intersect itself because that would make it not a manifold (at the intersection point, the neighborhood would not be homeomorphic to [0,1)). \n\nTherefore, any embedding of [0,1) into the plane must be a simple arc that doesn't cross itself and either goes to infinity or ends at a point. \n\nIf it ends at a point, like starting at a point and going off to infinity, then its complement is still connected. If it's a spiral going to infinity, still connected. \n\nWait, but maybe if the ray is dense in some region? But earlier the user mentioned that a dense A homeomorphic to [0,1) might not exist, or at least the example was retracted. \n\nAlternatively, think of a ray that is not properly embedded, like a line with a half-open interval removed. But not sure. \n\nWait, here's a thought. If you take a closed arc (which doesn't separate) and remove a point from it to make it half-open. The complement of the closed arc is connected. Removing a point from the arc gives a half-open arc. The complement of the half-open arc would then be the complement of the closed arc plus the removed point. But adding a point back in might not disconnect it. So, the complement remains connected. \n\nTherefore, maybe any half-open arc cannot separate the plane. Hence, the answer is no, such A does not exist. But how to prove it? \n\nThe user mentions that if the answer is no, the proof might be non-trivial, possibly using the Jordan arc theorem. \n\nAlternatively, consider that the half-open arc A is homeomorphic to [0,1), so it's a 1-manifold with boundary. The boundary is the starting point. The rest is a 1-manifold without boundary. So, embedding A into the plane, the starting point has a neighborhood in A like [0,1), and the rest is locally homeomorphic to (0,1). \n\nNow, suppose A separates the plane. Then R² \\ A has at least two connected components. But since A is a 1-dimensional object, perhaps it's similar to the Jordan curve theorem but for non-compact curves. \n\nHowever, the Jordan curve theorem applies to simple closed curves. For non-compact curves, the situation is different. For example, the x-axis (homeomorphic to R) separates the plane, but it's not compact. However, the x-axis is homeomorphic to (0,1), not [0,1). \n\nSo, maybe the key difference is whether the arc is \"closed\" at one end. The x-axis is open at both ends (homeomorphic to (0,1)), and it separates. But a half-open arc [0,1) is closed at one end. Maybe that closed end prevents it from separating. \n\nBut why? If you have a half-open arc, like a closed ray, why can't it separate? For example, imagine a ray starting at the origin and going to the right along the x-axis. Removing this ray doesn't disconnect the plane. But if you have a different embedding where the ray is somehow \"twisted\" to create a separation. \n\nAlternatively, consider a ray that is not straight, like a spiral. Removing the spiral ray doesn't disconnect the plane, as you can still navigate around it. \n\nAnother approach: Use homology or cohomology. If A is homeomorphic to [0,1), then it's contractible. The complement of a contractible set in the plane might be connected. But the x-axis is also contractible, and its complement is not connected. Wait, the x-axis is homeomorphic to R, which is contractible, and its complement has two components. So contractibility doesn't imply connected complement. \n\nBut in that case, the x-axis is homeomorphic to (0,1), which is different from [0,1). So the difference must lie in the compactness or the number of ends. \n\nWait, [0,1) has one end (at 1), while (0,1) has two ends. But when embedded in the plane, the number of ends might affect separation. For example, the x-axis (two ends) can separate, but a ray (one end) cannot. \n\nBut how to formalize this? \n\nPerhaps using the concept of ends of the space A. If A has two ends, like the x-axis, it can separate the plane. If it has one end, like a ray, it cannot. \n\nBut [0,1) has one end. So maybe any embedding of a space with one end cannot separate the plane. \n\nAlternatively, consider that the x-axis, being a line, has two ends going to infinity in both directions, hence it can separate. A ray, having one end, cannot. \n\nSo maybe the answer is that such a set A cannot separate the plane. Therefore, the problem's answer is no, and the proof would need to show that any embedding of [0,1) into the plane does not separate it. \n\nBut how to prove it? One approach might be to show that the complement of A is path-connected. Given any two points not in A, find a path between them avoiding A. \n\nIf A is a ray, say starting at the origin and going to infinity along the x-axis, then any two points not on A can be connected by a path that goes around A. Similarly, if A is a spiral, you can go around the spiral. \n\nBut if A is embedded in a more complicated way, like accumulating at some points, but since A is homeomorphic to [0,1), it must be a properly embedded ray (i.e., the embedding is proper, meaning the preimage of compact sets is compact). But not necessarily; the embedding could be non-proper. For example, a ray that accumulates at a point in the plane, but then it wouldn't be homeomorphic to [0,1) because near the accumulation point, the space would not be locally Euclidean. \n\nThus, any embedding of [0,1) into the plane must be a proper embedding, i.e., a ray going to infinity. In that case, the complement is still path-connected. Hence, A does not separate the plane. \n\nTherefore, the answer is no, such a set A does not exist. The problem is to prove that any subset A of R² homeomorphic to [0,1) does not separate the plane. \n\nNow, structuring the problem according to the required format: The assumptions are that A is a subset of R², homeomorphic to [0,1), and the problem is to prove that R² \\ A is not connected. Wait, no, the problem is to determine whether such an A exists that R² \\ A is not connected. But the original question is asking whether such an A exists. However, the example given in the initial instruction was structured as a \"prove that...\" problem. Here, the original question is \"Does there exist...\", which is a yes/no question. But according to the example, the problem is phrased as \"Prove that...\" even though the original was \"Prove that...\". However, in this case, the answer would be \"No, such A does not exist,\" so the problem could be phrased as \"Prove that no subset A of R² homeomorphic to [0,1) separates the plane.\" But the original question is just asking whether it's possible, so the formatted problem should reflect that. \n\nWait, the user's example took the original problem which was \"Prove that...\" and formatted it into the assumption and problem. Here, the original question is \"Does there exist...\", which is a yes/no question. However, the example given by the user transformed a \"Prove that...\" question into the same. Maybe the formatted problem should retain the question as is. \n\nBut the instructions say to structure the problem into assumptions and the problem statement. For this question, the assumptions are that A is a subset of R², homeomorphic to [0,1), and the problem is whether such an A can separate the plane. \n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions should list each condition line by line. So the assumptions here would be:\n\n- A is a subset of R²\n- A is homeomorphic to [0,1)\n- (Problem asks if such A separates the plane)\n\nBut the problem is \"Does there exist a subset A... which separates the plane...\", so the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a subset of R²,\nA is homeomorphic to [0,1).\nProblem:\nDetermine whether R² \\ A is not connected.\n\nBut the original problem's exact question is: \"Does there exist a subset A of R², homeomorphic to [0,1), such that R² \\ A is not connected?\" So the formatted problem should be that. However, the example given in the instructions rephrased the original problem into a \"Prove that...\" statement. So maybe here, since it's a yes/no question, the problem would be phrased as \"Prove that no subset A of R² homeomorphic to [0,1) separates the plane,\" assuming the answer is no. But since the original question is asking whether such A exists, the formatted problem should be \"Does there exist a subset A of R², homeomorphic to [0,1), such that R² \\ A is not connected?\" However, in the example, the original problem was a \"Prove that...\" and the formatted problem kept it as \"Prove that...\". \n\nFollowing the example's structure, even if the original question is a yes/no, we might need to present it as a statement to prove. But the user's example had an original problem that was a \"Prove that...\" and the formatted problem was the same. Here, the original question is \"Does there exist...\", which is different. However, the user might want to structure it as a problem to prove the answer. But since the answer is likely \"no\", the problem would be to prove that such an A does not exist. Therefore, the formatted problem would be: \"Prove that there does not exist a subset A of R², homeomorphic to [0,1), such that R² \\ A is not connected.\"\n\nBut I need to check the original question again. The user wrote: \"Does there exist a subset A of R² , which is homeomorphic to the half open interval [0, 1) , and which separates the plane, i.e., R² \\ A is not connected?\" So the formatted problem would be as per the example, which transformed a \"Prove that...\" into \"Prove that...\", so here, the problem would be phrased as \"Prove that no subset A...\", assuming the answer is no. Alternatively, if the answer is yes, it would be \"Prove that there exists...\". But since the user's note suggests that the answer is no and expects a non-trivial proof, likely the correct formatted problem is to prove non-existence. \n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- A is a subset of R²\n- A is homeomorphic to [0,1)\n\nProblem: Prove that R² \\ A is connected.\n\nBut wait, the original problem is about whether R² \\ A is not connected. So if the answer is no, then R² \\ A is always connected, so the problem would be \"Prove that for any subset A of R² homeomorphic to [0,1), R² \\ A is connected.\"\n\nBut the user's example had assumptions listed as properties of the objects involved. In the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, and the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. \n\nIn the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- A is a subset of R²\n- A is homeomorphic to [0,1)\n\nProblem: Prove that R² \\ A is connected.\n\nBut the original problem is phrased as \"Does there exist... such that R² \\ A is not connected?\" So the equivalent would be \"Prove that no such A exists,\" which can be rephrased as \"Prove that R² \\ A is connected for any A homeomorphic to [0,1).\"\n\nTherefore, structuring this into the required format:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a subset of R²,\nA is homeomorphic to [0,1).\n\nProblem:\nProve that R² \\ A is connected.",
