    "Content": "How to prove that $a=b=1$ is the only positive integer solution to the following Diophantine equation?$$a^3+a+1=3^b$$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Yes, $a=b=1$ is the only solution. As Mike Bennett suggests in the comments,\nthis can be proved by asking more generally for\ninteger points on the elliptic curves $y^2 = x^3 + x + 1$ [for $b$ even,\nwith $(x,y) = (a,3^{b/2})$] and $3y^2 = x^3+x+1$ [for $b$ odd, with\n$(a,y) = (a,3^{(b-1)/2})$]. Siegel's theorem shows that there are\nonly finitely many solutions; his proof is ineffective, but\nsince then new techniques have been developed and implemented to \nprovably list all solutions. As Gerry Myerson suggests in his comment, these curves\nare simple enough that the computation of their integer points\nhas already been done.  These days the most extensive online databases\nfor such results are collected in the LMFDB,\nso I looked there. The first curve, $y^2 = x^3 + x + 1$, is 496.a1 ;\nthere are two pairs of integral points, $(0,\\pm 1)$ and $(72,\\pm 611)$.\nOnly the first makes $y$ a power of $3$, and gives the solution $(a,b)=(0,0)$,\nwhich is integral, but not positive as Ghartal asks. The second curve, $3y^2 = x^3 + x + 1$, is not in Weiestrass form,\nbut we can take $X=3x$ and find that \n$$\nX^3+9X+27 = 27(x^3+x+1) = 81y^2 = (9y)^2,\n$$\nso $(3x,9y)$ is an integral point on the curve $Y^2 = X^3 + 9X + 27$.\nThis is curve 2232.j1 in the LMFDB; its only integral points are $(X,Y) = (-2,\\pm1)$ and $(3,\\pm9)$.\nThe former yields $(a,b) = (-2/3,-3)$, a rational solution but again\nnot satisfying Ghartal 's condition that $a,b$ be positive integers.\nThe latter yields the known solution $(a,b)=(1,1)$. This completes the determination of solutions of $a^3+a+1 = 3^b$\nin positive integers. It may be quite hard to give an elementary proof; e.g. once we have the\nnontrivial solution with $b=1$ it's impossible to exclude further \nsolutions by congruence conditions alone (congruence modulo\npowers of $3$ only impose conditions on $a$ modulo powers of $3$,\nwhich cannot combine with congruences to moduli coprime with $3$\nto give a contradiction).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me read the original problem again. The user provided an example where they listed assumptions and then the problem. The original question here is about positive integers a and b satisfying the equation a³ + a + 1 = 3^b, and they want to prove that a = b = 1 is the only solution.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions. The example given in the prompt lists each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. In the original problem, the key conditions are that a and b are positive integers. The equation itself is part of the problem statement, not assumptions.\n\nWait, but in the example provided by the user, they included an assumption about n being an integer and n divisible by 7, even though the original problem just said \"for every integer n\". Wait, no, looking back, the original example problem was to prove divisibility by 91, but the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. Wait, but in the original problem, it's for every integer n, but in the formatted example, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems like an error. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in their example. Let me check.\n\nOriginal example problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems contradictory. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", which would mean n is any integer, but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That would actually narrow down the problem. Maybe the user intended to have the original problem require n divisible by 7, but their example might have a mistake. But I should follow the user's instruction regardless.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user's question is about positive integers a, b solving a³ + a + 1 = 3^b. The problem is to prove that a = b = 1 is the only solution. The assumptions here are that a and b are positive integers. So each of those should be separate lines under assumptions. Then the problem is to prove that the only solution is a = b =1.\n\nWait, but the original problem states \"positive integers a,b\", so each is a separate assumption. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- a is a positive integer\n- b is a positive integer\n- The equation a³ + a + 1 = 3^b holds\n\nBut wait, in the example given, the equation was part of the problem statement, not the assumptions. Let me check the example again. The original problem in the example was \"Prove that for every integer n, A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem had assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Then the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. Wait, but the original problem didn't have n divisible by 7. So maybe the user made a mistake in their example. Alternatively, perhaps the example is correct, but in that case, the problem as presented in the example might have been misrepresented.\n\nWait, perhaps in the example, the original problem actually had n being divisible by 7, but the user wrote it incorrectly. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to have the assumptions include both the general condition (n is an integer) and a specific one (n divisible by 7), but the original problem says \"for every integer n\". That seems conflicting. Maybe the example is incorrect, but regardless, I need to follow the user's instruction for the current problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the equation a³ + a +1 = 3^b is part of the problem's condition. So the assumptions are that a and b are positive integers, and the equation holds. Wait, but in the example, the equation was part of the problem statement. Let me look again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem's assumptions were n is an integer and n divisible by 7, then the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. That seems inconsistent, because if n is any integer, then the divisibility by 7 is not required. So perhaps the user made a mistake in their example, but for the current problem, I need to follow the correct structure.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" So maybe in the example, the original problem had some additional conditions that the user filtered out, leaving n as an integer and n divisible by 7 as assumptions. But perhaps the original problem actually had n divisible by 7. The user's example might be correct, but the way they presented it could be confusing.\n\nBut regardless, for the current problem, the problem is: Positive integers a, b satisfying a³ +a +1 = 3^b. Prove that a = b =1 is the only solution.\n\nSo the assumptions here are:\n\n- a is a positive integer\n\n- b is a positive integer\n\n- a³ + a + 1 = 3^b (since this is the condition given)\n\nBut in the example, the equation was part of the problem statement, not the assumptions. Wait, in the example, the problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91, given the assumptions that n is an integer and n divisible by 7. So the equation defining A(n) was part of the problem statement. Similarly, here, the equation a³ +a +1 =3^b is part of the problem statement. Therefore, perhaps the equation is part of the problem, not the assumptions.\n\nWait, the example's formatted problem had:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nSo in that case, the equation defining A(n) is part of the problem statement, not the assumptions. Therefore, in the current problem, the equation a³ +a +1 =3^b is part of the problem statement. The assumptions are only the conditions on a and b, which are that they are positive integers.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- a is a positive integer\n\n- b is a positive integer\n\nThen the problem is to prove that the only solution to a³ +a +1 =3^b is a = b =1.\n\nBut wait, the original question says \"How to prove that a = b =1 is the only positive integer solution...\" So perhaps the problem is to show that under the assumptions that a and b are positive integers satisfying the equation, then necessarily a = b =1.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should list:\n\n- a is a positive integer\n\n- b is a positive integer\n\n- a³ + a +1 =3^b (since this is the equation they satisfy)\n\nBut wait, in the example, the equation was part of the problem. Hmm. Let me think again. The example's original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem's assumptions were n is integer and divisible by 7, then problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. Wait, that would mean that the original problem had n being any integer, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Unless there was a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended that the problem's assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. For example, if the original problem was \"Prove that if n is an integer divisible by 7, then A(n) is divisible by 91,\" then the formatted problem would list n being integer and divisible by 7 as assumptions, and the problem to prove A(n) divisible by 91. But in the example, the original problem was stated as \"for every integer n\", which suggests no restriction. So perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user wants us to list all given conditions as assumptions.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question is \"How to prove that a = b =1 is the only positive integer solution to the equation a³ +a +1=3^b\". So the conditions are that a and b are positive integers, and they satisfy the equation. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- a is a positive integer\n\n- b is a positive integer\n\n- a³ +a +1=3^b\n\nThen the problem is to prove that a =1 and b =1.\n\nBut in the example, the equation was part of the problem statement. Wait, in the example, the problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91, where A(n) is defined as 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n). So in that case, the definition of A(n) is part of the problem statement. Similarly, here, the equation a³ +a +1=3^b is part of the problem statement. Therefore, the assumptions are the conditions on a and b, which are being positive integers, and the equation is part of the problem.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumptions included n being an integer and divisible by 7. So perhaps the user's format requires all conditions that are given in the problem as assumptions. So if the problem states \"for every integer n\", then the assumption is n is an integer. If there are additional constraints, like n divisible by 7, then that's another assumption. In the current problem, the problem states \"positive integers a,b\", so those are two assumptions. The equation itself is the condition they satisfy, which could be part of the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: a is a positive integer\n\nAssumption: b is a positive integer\n\nProblem: Prove that the only solution to the equation a³ + a +1=3^b is a =1 and b=1.\n\nAlternatively, the equation could be part of the problem statement, not the assumptions. Let me check the example again. In the example, the equation defining A(n) is part of the problem statement. The assumptions are about n. So here, the equation is part of the problem, and the assumptions are about a and b.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption: a is a positive integer\n\nAssumption: b is a positive integer\n\nProblem: Prove that the only solution to the equation a³ + a +1=3^b is a =1 and b=1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the equation is part of the problem's statement, so:\n\nProblem: Prove that the only positive integers a, b satisfying a³ + a +1=3^b are a=1 and b=1.\n\nBut according to the example, the problem statement starts with \"Prove that...\", including the equation. So perhaps the equation is part of the problem. The assumptions are just the conditions on the variables. Therefore, in this case, the assumptions are that a and b are positive integers, and the problem is to prove that the equation holds only when a and b are 1.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: a is a positive integer\n\nAssumption: b is a positive integer\n\nProblem: Prove that the equation a³ + a +1=3^b holds only when a=1 and b=1.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each assumption is one property applied to one object. The equation is part of the problem statement. Therefore, this follows the example's structure.",
