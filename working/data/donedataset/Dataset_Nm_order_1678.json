    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants to prove the asymptotic formula for the Bessel function J_ν(x) as x approaches infinity. The formula given is J_ν(x) ∼ sqrt(2/(πx)) cos(x - (2ν +1)/4 π) + O(1/x^(3/2)). \n\nFirst, I need to recall what Bessel functions are and their properties. Bessel functions are solutions to Bessel's differential equation, which arises in problems involving cylindrical symmetry, like heat conduction in a circular cylinder or wave propagation. The Bessel function of the first kind, J_ν(x), is one such solution. \n\nAsymptotic expansions for Bessel functions are usually derived using methods like the method of steepest descent or integral representations. The standard asymptotic expansion for large arguments (x → ∞) is known, and the user is referring to that. The formula resembles the leading term of the asymptotic expansion plus an error term. \n\nI remember that for large x, the Bessel function can be approximated using an oscillatory function multiplied by a decaying amplitude. The leading term involves a cosine function whose phase depends on the order ν. The amplitude here is sqrt(2/(πx)), and the phase shift is (x - (2ν +1)/4 π). The error term is of order 1/x^(3/2), which is smaller than the leading term, which is of order 1/sqrt(x). \n\nTo derive this, one possible approach is to start from an integral representation of J_ν(x). For example, J_ν(x) can be written as an integral over a contour in the complex plane or using the Poisson integral formula. Alternatively, there's the Sommerfeld integral representation. \n\nAnother method is to use the method of steepest descent (also called the saddle-point method) for evaluating the integral representation asymptotically. This involves deforming the contour of integration to pass through saddle points where the phase is stationary, and then expanding the integrand around those points to approximate the integral. \n\nAlternatively, one might use the differential equation approach. The Bessel equation is x²y'' + xy' + (x² - ν²)y = 0. For large x, the term x² dominates, so the equation resembles y'' + y = 0, whose solutions are sinusoids. However, this is a rough intuition and to get the precise asymptotic form including the phase shift and amplitude, more refined techniques are needed, such as the WKB approximation. \n\nBut I think the standard way is to start from an integral representation. Let me recall that J_ν(x) can be expressed as (1/π) ∫₀^π cos(x sinθ - νθ) dθ - (sin(νπ)/π) ∫₀^∞ e^{-x sinh t - ν t} dt. For large x, the second integral involving the exponential decay becomes negligible, so the dominant term is the first integral. \n\nSo focusing on the first integral: (1/π) ∫₀^π cos(x sinθ - νθ) dθ. To evaluate this integral for large x, we can use the method of stationary phase. The method of stationary phase approximates integrals of the form ∫ e^{i x φ(θ)} dθ by expanding around the points where the phase φ(θ) is stationary, i.e., where the derivative φ’(θ) = 0. \n\nIn this case, the integral is ∫ cos(x sinθ - νθ) dθ from 0 to π. Let's write this as the real part of ∫ e^{i(x sinθ - νθ)} dθ. So we can apply the method of stationary phase to this complex integral. \n\nThe phase function here is φ(θ) = sinθ - (ν/x)θ. But since x is large and ν is fixed, perhaps the term (ν/x)θ is negligible compared to sinθ? Wait, but if ν is of order 1 and x is going to infinity, then ν/x tends to zero. So maybe we can approximate the phase as φ(θ) ≈ sinθ. \n\nHowever, the stationary points occur where dφ/dθ = 0. So for φ(θ) = sinθ, the derivative is cosθ, which is zero at θ = π/2. But if we include the term - (ν/x)θ, then the derivative becomes cosθ - ν/x. Setting this to zero gives cosθ = ν/x. For large x, ν/x is small, so cosθ ≈ 0, which again gives θ ≈ π/2. So the main contribution to the integral comes from near θ = π/2. \n\nExpanding sinθ around θ = π/2: let θ = π/2 + t, where t is small. Then sinθ = sin(π/2 + t) = cos t ≈ 1 - t²/2. Similarly, the phase becomes x cos t - ν(π/2 + t) ≈ x(1 - t²/2) - νπ/2 - ν t. \n\nSo the exponent becomes x - (x t²)/2 - νπ/2 - ν t. Then the integral becomes approximately e^{i(x - νπ/2)} ∫ e^{-i x t²/2 - i ν t} dt. The limits of integration for t would be from -π/2 to π/2, but since t is small around the stationary point, we can extend the limits to ±∞ as an approximation. \n\nThe integral becomes e^{i(x - νπ/2)} ∫_{-∞}^∞ e^{-i (x t²/2 + ν t)} dt. This is a Gaussian integral. Let's complete the square in the exponent. Let me write the exponent as -i x t²/2 - i ν t = -i x/2 (t² + (2 ν/x) t). Completing the square: t² + (2ν/x) t = (t + ν/x)^2 - (ν²/x²). So the exponent becomes -i x/2 [ (t + ν/x)^2 - ν²/x² ] = -i x/2 (t + ν/x)^2 + i ν²/(2x). \n\nTherefore, the integral becomes e^{i(x - νπ/2 + ν²/(2x))} ∫_{-∞}^∞ e^{-i x/2 (t + ν/x)^2} dt. Let u = t + ν/x, then du = dt, and the integral becomes ∫_{-∞}^∞ e^{-i x/2 u²} du. This is a standard Fresnel integral. The integral of e^{-i a u²} du from -∞ to ∞ is sqrt(π/(i a)) = sqrt(π/(a)) e^{-i π/4}. \n\nHere, a = x/2, so the integral becomes sqrt(2π/(x)) e^{-i π/4}. Putting it all together, the integral approximation is e^{i(x - νπ/2 + ν²/(2x))} * sqrt(2π/x) e^{-i π/4}. \n\nNow, taking the real part (since the original integral was the real part of this complex integral), we have Re[ e^{i(x - νπ/2 + ν²/(2x))} * sqrt(2π/x) e^{-i π/4} ] = sqrt(2π/x) Re[ e^{i(x - νπ/2 + ν²/(2x) - π/4)} ].\n\nSince x is large, the term ν²/(2x) is negligible, so we can approximate the exponent as x - νπ/2 - π/4. Therefore, the real part becomes sqrt(2π/x) cos(x - νπ/2 - π/4) = sqrt(2π/x) cos(x - (2ν +1)/4 π).\n\nBut wait, let's check the coefficients. νπ/2 + π/4 = π/4 (2ν +1), so x - (2ν +1)π/4. Hence, the cosine term is cos(x - (2ν +1)π/4). \n\nPutting this together, the leading term of the integral (divided by π, as in the original expression (1/π) ∫ ... dθ) becomes (1/π) * sqrt(2π/x) cos(x - (2ν +1)π/4) = sqrt(2/(π x)) cos(x - (2ν +1)π/4). \n\nTherefore, the asymptotic expansion of J_ν(x) is sqrt(2/(π x)) cos(x - (2ν +1)π/4) plus higher-order terms. The error term in the original problem is stated as O(1/x^{3/2}), which is consistent because the next term in the expansion would come from higher-order terms in the stationary phase approximation, which typically decrease by a factor of 1/x each time. So the first correction would be O(1/x^{3/2}).\n\nTherefore, the asymptotic formula is proven. However, I need to verify if there are any conditions on ν. The problem statement says ν is a real number, so no restrictions other than being real. The original integral representation for J_ν(x) is valid for real ν, so the asymptotic formula should hold for any real ν. \n\nAnother check: the standard asymptotic formula for J_ν(x) is indeed given by sqrt(2/(π x)) cos(x - (νπ/2 + π/4)) + O(1/x^{3/2}), which simplifies to the expression in the problem. So yes, this matches. \n\nPossible sources for the proof: Classic texts on Bessel functions like Watson's \"A Treatise on the Theory of Bessel Functions\" or asymptotic methods books like Olver's \"Asymptotics and Special Functions\". Alternatively, online resources like DLMF (Digital Library of Mathematical Functions) would have this expansion. For example, DLMF section 10.17 gives the asymptotic expansions for Bessel functions. \n\nSo the key steps are:\n1. Start from an integral representation of J_ν(x).\n2. Apply the method of stationary phase (or steepest descent) to evaluate the integral for large x.\n3. Expand around the stationary point (θ = π/2) and compute the leading term.\n4. Show that the result gives the asymptotic formula with the cosine term and the specified error term.\n\nThis approach should suffice to prove the given asymptotic formula.",
