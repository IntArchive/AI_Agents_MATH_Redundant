    "Content": "I am trying to prove the following. I have seen it alluded to in other places of the internet (this site included) but without proof. Let $L,L_1\\ldots L_n$ be linear functionals on a vector space $X$ .

    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $K$ denote the scalar field. Consider $F\\colon X \\to K^n$ given by $$F(x) = \\begin{pmatrix}L_1(x)\\\\ L_2(x)\\\\ \\vdots \\\\ L_n(x)\\end{pmatrix}.$$ Let $R = \\operatorname{im} F \\subset K^n$. We have an induced isomorphism $$\\tilde{F}\\colon X/\\ker F \\xrightarrow{\\sim} R.$$ Since $\\bigcap\\limits_{k=1}^n \\ker L_k = \\ker F \\subset \\ker L$, we have an induced linear form $\\tilde{L} \\colon X/\\ker F \\to K$, and can pull that back to $R$ as $\\hat{L} := \\tilde{L} \\circ \\tilde{F}^{-1}$. We can extend $\\hat{L}$ to all of $K^n$ (extend a basis of $R$ to a basis of $K^n$, and choose arbitrary values, e.g. $0$, on the basis vectors not in $R$). Thus there is a linear form $\\lambda \\colon K^n \\to K$ with $$\\lambda \\circ F = \\lambda\\lvert_R \\circ F = \\hat{L}\\circ F = \\tilde{L}\\circ \\tilde{F}^{-1}\\circ F = \\tilde{L} \\circ \\pi = L,$$ where $\\pi \\colon X \\to X/\\ker F$ is the canonical projection. But every linear form $K^n\\to K$ can be written as a linear combination of the component projections, so there are $c_1,\\dotsc, c_n$ with $$\\lambda\\begin{pmatrix}u_1\\\\u_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ u_n \\end{pmatrix} = \\sum_{k=1}^n c_k\\cdot u_k,$$ and that means $$L(x) = \\lambda(F(x)) = \\sum_{k=1}^n c_k\\cdot L_k(x)$$ for all $x\\in X$, or $$L = \\sum_{k=1}^n c_k\\cdot L_k.$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to break this down. The problem is about linear functionals and their kernels. So, first, I need to recall what a linear functional is. A linear functional on a vector space X is a linear map from X to the field of scalars, which here is probably the real numbers since they mention t_i ∈ ℝ. The kernel of a linear functional L, written as ker(L), is the set of all vectors x in X such that L(x) = 0.\n\nThe problem states that if the intersection of the kernels of L_1 through L_n is contained within the kernel of another linear functional L, then L can be expressed as a linear combination of the L_i's. In other words, L is linearly dependent on the L_i's.\n\nLet me parse the assumptions. The problem mentions that L, L_1, ..., L_n are linear functionals on X. The key condition is that the intersection of the kernels of the L_i's is a subset of the kernel of L. So, any vector x that is in all ker(L_i) must also be in ker(L). \n\nThe goal is to show that there exist scalars t_1, ..., t_n such that L = t_1 L_1 + ... + t_n L_n. That would mean L is a linear combination of the other functionals, hence they are linearly dependent.\n\nI need to make sure I understand the exact conditions. The problem doesn't specify anything about the dimension of X. So, X could be finite-dimensional or infinite-dimensional. Wait, but in the case of infinite-dimensional spaces, linear functionals might behave differently. However, the problem statement doesn't restrict X to being finite-dimensional. But the result might require X to be finite-dimensional? Hmm, but the user hasn't mentioned that in the original problem. Let me check the original question again.\n\nLooking at the original question: It just says \"vector space X\" without specifying finite-dimensional. However, the conclusion that L is a linear combination of the L_i's might require that X is finite-dimensional. Wait, but actually, in linear algebra, even in infinite-dimensional spaces, if you have a finite set of functionals, their linear combinations can be considered. But the result that the intersection of their kernels being contained in another functional's kernel implying linear dependence might hold under some conditions. Maybe the key here is that the functionals are in the dual space, and if their intersection is contained in another functional's kernel, that functional must be in their span.\n\nBut wait, in finite dimensions, the dual space has the same dimension as the original space. If we have n functionals, then their span is a subspace of the dual space. If the intersection of their kernels is contained in the kernel of L, then L is in their span. But in infinite dimensions, this might not hold. For example, if you have an infinite-dimensional space, the dual space is much larger, and the intersection of kernels of a finite number of functionals might still be a very large subspace, but there could be functionals not in their span whose kernels contain this intersection.\n\nWait, but the problem statement claims that this is true, as per the user's question, so maybe there's a standard result here. Let me recall the related theorems. In finite-dimensional spaces, if we have functionals L_1, ..., L_n, then any functional L whose kernel contains the intersection of the kernels of the L_i's must be a linear combination of the L_i's. This is related to the duality between subspaces of the dual space and their annihilators. \n\nSpecifically, in finite-dimensional spaces, if S is a set of linear functionals, then the annihilator of the intersection of their kernels is the span of S. So, if the kernel of L contains the intersection of the kernels of the L_i's, then L is in the annihilator of that intersection, which is the span of the L_i's. Hence, L is a linear combination of the L_i's. \n\nBut this relies on the finite-dimensionality because in infinite dimensions, the annihilator of a subspace might not be the same as the span. So, the user might be assuming finite-dimensionality, or maybe the problem holds in general. However, the original problem does not specify that X is finite-dimensional. That might be an oversight, or perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the context of finite-dimensional spaces, as the user refers to other places on the internet where this is alluded to without proof, possibly in standard linear algebra contexts which are usually finite-dimensional.\n\nSo, as per the user's instruction to list assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object, I should check if the original problem specifies any assumptions. The original problem states: Let L, L_1, ..., L_n be linear functionals on a vector space X. If the intersection of the kernels of L_i is contained in ker(L), then there exist real numbers t_i such that L is the sum of t_i L_i.\n\nThe original problem does not specify that X is finite-dimensional. However, the conclusion might not hold in infinite-dimensional spaces. For instance, take X to be an infinite-dimensional space, and take L_1, ..., L_n to be linearly independent functionals. The intersection of their kernels is a subspace of X. If L is another functional whose kernel contains this intersection, does L have to be a linear combination of the L_i's? I'm not sure. \n\nIn finite dimensions, suppose X has dimension m. Then, each functional is a covector, and the intersection of kernels of n functionals is the set of vectors orthogonal to all of them. If that intersection is contained in ker(L), then L must be in the span of the n functionals. But in infinite dimensions, maybe not. For example, consider X as the space of real sequences, and let L_i be the coordinate functionals for i=1 to n. Then the intersection of their kernels is the set of sequences zero in the first n coordinates. If L is another coordinate functional, say the (n+1)-th, its kernel contains that intersection, but L is not a linear combination of L_1,...,L_n. Wait, but in this case, the intersection of the kernels of L_1,...,L_n is the subspace where the first n coordinates are zero. The kernel of L (the (n+1)-th coordinate functional) is all sequences with zero in the (n+1)-th position. The intersection of the L_i's is not contained in ker(L), because a sequence that is zero in the first n coordinates can have any value in the (n+1)-th coordinate. So, the intersection is not contained in ker(L). \n\nWait, maybe in infinite dimensions, you can have a functional whose kernel contains the intersection of the kernels of some finite set of functionals, but the functional is not in their span. Let's see. Suppose X is a space with basis {e_1, e_2, ...}. Let L_i be the dual functionals such that L_i(e_j) = δ_{ij}. Take n=1, so L_1(e_j) = δ_{1j}. The kernel of L_1 is the span of {e_2, e_3, ...}. Suppose L is a functional such that ker(L) contains ker(L_1). Then L must vanish on all e_j for j ≥2. So, L is determined by its value on e_1. Let’s say L(e_1) = c. Then L = c L_1. So, in this case, even in infinite dimensions, L is a scalar multiple of L_1. Hmm, interesting. So maybe the result holds even in infinite-dimensional spaces?\n\nWait, but in this example, even though X is infinite-dimensional, when n=1, the kernel of L_1 is a hyperplane (codimension 1), and if ker(L_1) is contained in ker(L), then L must be a scalar multiple of L_1. That seems to hold regardless of the dimension of X. Because if two linear functionals have kernels where one is contained in the other, then one is a scalar multiple of the other. That's a standard result. \n\nBut what if n >1? Let's take n=2. Suppose L_1 and L_2 are two functionals on an infinite-dimensional space. The intersection of their kernels is ker(L_1) ∩ ker(L_2). Suppose L is a functional whose kernel contains this intersection. Does L have to be a linear combination of L_1 and L_2?\n\nFor example, let X be the space of real sequences, L_1(e_j) = δ_{1j}, L_2(e_j) = δ_{2j}. Then ker(L_1) is the span of {e_2, e_3, ...}, ker(L_2) is the span of {e_1, e_3, e_4, ...}, so their intersection is span of {e_3, e_4, ...}. Suppose L is a functional such that L(e_j) =0 for j ≥3. Then ker(L) contains the intersection of ker(L_1) and ker(L_2). But L can be any linear combination of L_1 and L_2 plus some other functional that vanishes on e_3, e_4, etc. Wait, no. If L vanishes on e_3, e_4, ..., then L is determined by its values on e_1 and e_2. So, L = a L_1 + b L_2. Therefore, even in this case, L must be a combination of L_1 and L_2. \n\nWait, maybe even in infinite dimensions, as long as you have a finite number of functionals, if the intersection of their kernels is contained in the kernel of another functional, then the latter is a linear combination of the former. \n\nIs this a general result? Let's think abstractly. Let L_1, ..., L_n be linear functionals on X (any vector space over ℝ). Suppose that ⋂_{i=1}^n ker(L_i) ⊆ ker(L). Then L is a linear combination of the L_i's.\n\nTo prove this, consider the map T: X → ℝ^n defined by T(x) = (L_1(x), ..., L_n(x)). The kernel of T is ⋂_{i=1}^n ker(L_i). The condition ⋂ ker(L_i) ⊆ ker(L) implies that ker(T) ⊆ ker(L). Therefore, L factors through T; that is, there exists a linear map f: ℝ^n → ℝ such that L = f ∘ T. But any linear map from ℝ^n to ℝ is of the form f(y_1, ..., y_n) = t_1 y_1 + ... + t_n y_n for some scalars t_i. Therefore, L(x) = t_1 L_1(x) + ... + t_n L_n(x). \n\nAh! This argument works for any vector space X, not necessarily finite-dimensional. Because we're using the universal property of quotient spaces. If ker(T) ⊆ ker(L), then L induces a linear map on X/ker(T), which can be identified with the image of T, which is a subspace of ℝ^n. Then, since X/ker(T) is isomorphic to im(T), and L induces a functional on im(T), which can be extended to a functional on all of ℝ^n (since any subspace of ℝ^n is a direct summand), hence the functional is given by some combination t_i. \n\nBut wait, extending a linear functional from a subspace to the whole space requires the Axiom of Choice in infinite-dimensional spaces, but since here im(T) is a subspace of ℝ^n, which is finite-dimensional, so we can extend without AC. Therefore, even in infinite-dimensional X, as long as the number of functionals n is finite, the result holds. \n\nTherefore, the assumptions needed are just that L, L_1, ..., L_n are linear functionals on a vector space X (over ℝ, since the coefficients are real), and that the intersection of the kernels of L_i is contained in the kernel of L. \n\nThe original problem doesn't specify the field, but since the user mentions t_i ∈ ℝ, we can assume the field is ℝ. \n\nSo, the assumptions are:\n\n1. L is a linear functional on X.\n2. For each i = 1, ..., n, L_i is a linear functional on X.\n3. The intersection of the kernels of L_1, ..., L_n is a subset of the kernel of L.\n\nThe problem is to prove that there exist real numbers t_1, ..., t_n such that L = t_1 L_1 + ... + t_n L_n.\n\nSo, according to the required format, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nL is a linear functional on vector space X,\nFor each i in 1 to n, L_i is a linear functional on X,\nThe intersection of ker(L_i) for i=1 to n is contained in ker(L).\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exist real numbers t_1, ..., t_n such that L = Σ_{i=1}^n t_i L_i.\n\nBut wait, in the example given by the user, they included the divisibility by 7 as an assumption. However, in the original problem here, the only assumptions are those stated: the functionals are linear, and the intersection of kernels is contained in L's kernel. There's no additional condition like X being finite-dimensional, because as per our analysis, the result holds for any vector space over ℝ, given finite n.\n\nSo the user's example had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. But here, the assumptions are three: L is a linear functional, each L_i is a linear functional, and the intersection of their kernels is in L's kernel. However, the user's example lists two assumptions, each as separate lines. So here, each line should be one assumption.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have the following assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\nL is a linear functional on vector space X,\nFor each i from 1 to n, L_i is a linear functional on X,\nThe intersection of the kernels of L_i (i=1 to n) is a subset of the kernel of L.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exist real numbers t_1, ..., t_n such that L = Σ_{i=1}^n t_i L_i.\n\nBut the user's original problem mentions \"linear dependence of functionals\". Note that if L is expressed as a combination of L_i's, then the set {L, L_1, ..., L_n} is linearly dependent. But the conclusion here is that L is in the span of the L_i's, which implies that the functionals are linearly dependent. However, the problem statement might be slightly different. But the way the user phrased it: \"if the intersection of kernels of linear functionals is contained by the kernel of another linear functional then they are linearly dependent.\" Here, \"they\" presumably refers to L and the L_i's. So the conclusion is that L is in the span of the L_i's, making the set {L, L_1, ..., L_n} linearly dependent. But the problem as formatted by the user in the example says \"Prove that there exist t_i such that L = sum t_i L_i\". Which is equivalent.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatted problem is as above. The key assumptions are about the linearity of the functionals and the inclusion of the intersection of their kernels in L's kernel. The problem is to show the existence of the coefficients.",
