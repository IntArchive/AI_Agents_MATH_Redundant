    "Content": "Let$$0\\to E \\to F \\to L\\to0$$be a exact sequence on coherent sheaves and $L$ be a line bundle, then it induces a short exact sequence on wedge product $$0\\to \\Lambda^p E \\to \\Lambda^p F \\to \\Lambda^{p-1}E \\otimes L\\to0$$ I want to understand this statement, both in proof and intuition.\nFor the proof I think I have the basic idea: denote the map $F \\to L$ by $i$, then the map $\\Lambda^p F \\to \\Lambda^{p-1}E \\otimes L$ is given by (on basis) $$f_1\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge f_p\\longmapsto \\sum_k(-1)^k f_1\\wedge\\cdots \\hat f_k\\cdots\\wedge f_p\\otimes i(f_k)$$ by definition the image lies in $\\Lambda^{p-1}F\\otimes L$, but by applying $i$ somehow we can see the image really lies in $\\Lambda^{p-1}E\\otimes L$. (because it vanishes) My question is: Is my idea correct? I am not familiar with this calculation so I cannot wirte down explicitly \"applying $i$ somehow  (somehow means $\\Lambda^{p-1} i \\otimes id$ maybe?) we can see the image really lies in $\\Lambda^{p-1}E\\otimes L$.\" Is there an intuitive picture of how should I think of this?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Like often when dealing with sheaves/vector bundles, this is a two-step process. First define maps, then check their properties (exact sequence/isomorphisms...) The first step needs a global construction, for the second, we will be able to work locally. Step 1 : this is hard to define properly a map $\\bigwedge^p F\\rightarrow \\bigwedge^{p-1}E\\otimes L$ since we don't have maps $F\\rightarrow E$, so we will proceed differently. Let $C$ be the cokernel of $\\bigwedge^pE\\rightarrow\\bigwedge^pF$. Tensor the exact sequence $0\\rightarrow E\\rightarrow F\\rightarrow L\\rightarrow 0$ by $\\bigwedge^{p-1}E$ and construct the diagram :\n$$\n\\require{AMScd}\n\\begin{CD}\n0@>>>\\bigwedge^{p-1}E\\otimes E@>>>\\bigwedge^{p-1}E\\otimes F@>>>\\bigwedge^{p-1}E\\otimes L@>>>0\\\\\n{}@VVV@VVV\\\\\n0@>>>\\bigwedge^pE@>>>\\bigwedge^pF@>>>C@>>>0\n\\end{CD}\n$$\nwhere the first vertical map is the usual product in the exterior algebra $$(e_1\\wedge...\\wedge e_{p-1})\\otimes e_p\\mapsto e_1\\wedge...\\wedge e_{p-1}\\wedge e_p $$ and the second is the composition of $\\bigwedge^{p-1}E\\otimes F\\rightarrow\\bigwedge^{p-1} F\\otimes F\\rightarrow F$, in other words : $$(e_1\\wedge...\\wedge e_{p-1})\\otimes f_p\\mapsto i(e_1)\\wedge...\\wedge i(e_{p-1})\\wedge f_p$$\nClearly, the square is commutative, hence we have an induce map $\\bigwedge^{p-1}E\\otimes L\\longrightarrow C$. Step 2 : let us show that this map is an isomorphism. This is enough to work locally. In this case, we can assume that $F\\simeq E\\oplus L$, and that $E$ and $L$ are free with basis $e_1,...,e_n$ and $l$. We have induced basis for $F$ (written by abuse of notations $(e_1,...,e_n,l)$), basis for every exterior power of $E$ (for $\\bigwedge^k E$, this is the family $(e_I)_I$ with $I\\subset\\{1,...,n\\}$ is of cardinality $k$) and for every exterior power of $F$ (for $\\bigwedge^k F$, this is the family $(e_J)_J\\cup(e_I\\wedge l)$ with $I,J\\subset\\{1,...,n\\}$ is of cardinality $k-1$ and $k$ respectively). Injectivity : assume $\\sum a_I e_I\\otimes l$ is in the kernel. By diagram chasing, $\\sum a_I e_I\\wedge l$ is an element of $\\bigwedge^pE$, but this is not possible because $e_I\\wedge l$ are linearly independent and are not $\\bigwedge^p E$, unless all the $a_I$ are zero. Surjectivity : let $c\\in C$ and $\\sum a_J e_J+\\sum b_I e_I\\wedge l$ a lift in $\\bigwedge^p F$ (here the sum is over all $J\\subset\\{1,...,n\\}$ of cardinality $p$ and all $I\\subset\\{1,...,n\\}$ of cardinality $p-1$). Clearly, $\\sum b_I e_I\\wedge l$ is another lift of $c$. This shows that $c$ is the image of $\\sum b_I e_I\\otimes l$. Hence the vertical map is an isomorphism and this concludes the proof. You proposed another map for $\\bigwedge^p F\\rightarrow \\bigwedge^{p-1}E\\otimes L$. Let us see if this is indeed the same : We only need to compute your map and mine on our previous basis. Let $J=\\{i_1,....,i_p\\}\\subset\\{1,...,n\\}$ with $i_1<...<i_p$, then $e_J=e_{i_1}\\wedge...\\wedge e_{i_p}$. With the previous construction, this is an element of $\\bigwedge^p E$ so this element is zero in $C\\simeq\\bigwedge^{p-1}E\\otimes L$. With your definition, this is also $0$. Let $I=\\{i_1,....,i_{p-1}\\}\\subset\\{1,...,n\\}$ with $i_1<...<i_{p-1}$. Then $e_I\\wedge l=e_{i_1}\\wedge...\\wedge e_{i_{p-1}}\\wedge l$. With the previous construction, this maps to $e_{i_1}\\wedge...\\wedge e_{i_{p-1}}\\otimes l$. With your construction, this maps to\n$$\\sum_k (-1)^k e_{i_1}\\wedge...\\wedge\\widehat{e_{i_k}}\\wedge...\\wedge e_{i_{p-1}}\\wedge l\\times 0+(-1)^p e_{i_1}\\wedge...\\wedge e_{i_{p-1}}\\otimes l$$ Hence your map is the same as mine, up to the $(-1)^p$ sign. Note : working instead with the sequence $0\\rightarrow \\bigwedge^p E\\rightarrow\\bigwedge^p F\\rightarrow L\\otimes \\bigwedge^{p-1}E\\rightarrow 0$ remove the sign. Finally, some kind of interpretation : $F$ is made of $E$ and $L$. Thus $\\bigwedge^p F$ is made of $\\bigwedge^p E$ (clearly a subobject) and something else. If $F$ splits as $F\\simeq E\\oplus L$, then we would have decomposition $f_i=e_i+l_i$ so that $$f_1\\wedge...\\wedge f_p=(e_1+l_1)\\wedge...\\wedge (e_p+l_p)=(e_1\\wedge...\\wedge e_p)+\\sum_k e_1\\wedge...\\wedge l_k\\wedge ...\\wedge e_p + 0$$\nThe zero comes from the fact that $L$ is of dimension $1$ so every product $l_i\\wedge l_k$ above will be zero. Since you can change the order of terms (with a sign), you can put the $l_i$ at the end, so every element $f_1\\wedge...\\wedge f_p$ is a sum of an element of $\\bigwedge^p E$ and an element of the form $e_1\\wedge...\\wedge e_{p-1}\\wedge l$. It turns out (since we can produce adequate morphisms) that the part of $\\bigwedge^p F$ made by the elements of the form $e_1\\wedge...\\wedge e_{p-1}\\wedge l$ is a quotient which is $\\bigwedge^{p-1}E\\otimes L$. More generally, if $L$ is not a line bundle anymore (write it $G$), the decomposition $\\bigwedge^p(E\\oplus G)=\\bigoplus_{i+j=p}\\bigwedge^i E\\otimes\\bigwedge^j G$ still has an interpretation if the sequence $0\\rightarrow E\\rightarrow F\\rightarrow G\\rightarrow 0$ does not split. Indeed, the bundle $\\bigwedge^pF$ is now endowed with a filtration $F^k\\bigwedge^pF$ such that $F^k\\bigwedge^pF$ is the image of $E^{\\otimes k}\\otimes F^{p-k}\\rightarrow F^p\\rightarrow\\bigwedge^p F$ (in other words, $F^k\\bigwedge^pF$ is the subset of $\\bigwedge^pF$ whose elements can be written with a product of $k$-elements from $E$). Now, the successive quotient are $F^k/F^{k+1}=\\bigwedge^k E\\otimes\\bigwedge^{p-k} G$. You are in the situation where the filtration is of only 2-steps :\n$$ 0=F^{p+1}\\bigwedge^pF\\subset\\bigwedge^p E=F^p\\bigwedge^p F\\subset F^{p-1}\\bigwedge^p F=\\bigwedge^p F$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to parse the original question and filter out any unrelated information. The original question is about an induced short exact sequence on wedge products. \n\nThe user provided an example where assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. In the example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. The problem then restated the expression to prove divisibility by 91.\n\nLooking at the current problem: The title is \"Induced short exact sequence on wedge product.\" The question starts with a short exact sequence of coherent sheaves: 0 → E → F → L → 0, where L is a line bundle. The goal is to prove that this induces another short exact sequence: 0 → Λ^p E → Λ^p F → Λ^{p-1}E ⊗ L → 0. The user also mentions their attempt at the proof and asks for verification of their idea and intuition.\n\nSo, the main elements here are the exact sequence of sheaves, L being a line bundle, and the induced exact sequence on wedge products. The assumptions should include the exact sequence, the coherence of the sheaves, L being a line bundle, and perhaps the context of wedge products. \n\nBreaking down the assumptions line by line:\n\n1. The sequence 0 → E → F → L → 0 is exact.\n2. E, F, L are coherent sheaves.\n3. L is a line bundle.\n4. The problem involves wedge products Λ^p E, Λ^p F, and Λ^{p-1}E ⊗ L.\n\nEach of these addresses a single property or condition. The problem statement is to prove that the given short exact sequence induces the specified sequence on wedge products, understanding both the proof and intuition.\n\nI need to ensure that each assumption is concise and only addresses one aspect. The original question mentions coherent sheaves and L being a line bundle explicitly. The exactness of the sequence is another key assumption. The problem is to prove the induced exact sequence on the wedge products. The user's own proof idea and questions about intuition are part of their inquiry but not part of the problem's assumptions, so those should be excluded from the formatted problem.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list the assumptions as the exact sequence, the sheaves being coherent, L being a line bundle, and then state the problem of proving the induced exact sequence on the wedge products.",
