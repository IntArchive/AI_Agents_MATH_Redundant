    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into their specified structure. The example they provided shows that assumptions should list each condition applied to one object, line by line. The problem statement is then written concisely.\n\nLooking at the original problem from the user: the title is about proving that (π/2)^2 equals 1 plus a sum involving the Riemann zeta function. The question mentions Wolfram Alpha stating an identity and asks for a proof. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states an identity involving π squared over four, a sum from k=1 to infinity, and the zeta function at even integers. The original equation in the title is written correctly, but the user's question in the body has a slightly different version with a factor of 2 in front of the sum. Wait, let me check that again. The title has (π/2)^2 = 1 + sum_{k=1}^∞ (2k-1)ζ(2k)/2^{2k-1}, whereas the question body says the sum is multiplied by 2 and the denominator is 2^{2k}. Hmm, maybe there's a discrepancy here. Let me parse it carefully.\n\nTitle: (π/2)^2 = 1 + sum_{k=1}^∞ [(2k-1)ζ(2k)/2^{2k-1}]\n\nQuestion body: WolframAlpha says (π/2)^2 = 1 + 2 * sum_{k=1}^∞ [(2k-1)ζ(2k)/2^{2k}]\n\nSo the difference is 2 multiplied by the sum, with denominator 2^{2k} instead of 2^{2k-1}. Let's verify if these are equivalent. Let's see: 2 * [ (2k-1)ζ(2k)/2^{2k} ] is the same as (2k-1)ζ(2k)/2^{2k -1}. So yes, the two expressions are the same. Therefore, the problem is consistent. \n\nSo the problem is to prove that identity. Now, in the example given by the user, the assumptions listed were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. But in this problem, there are no explicit assumptions given in the question. The problem is purely to prove the identity. However, perhaps we need to list any implicit assumptions. For example, the sum is from k=1 to infinity, so k is a positive integer. The zeta function ζ(2k) is defined for integers 2k ≥ 2, which is true here since k ≥1. Also, the convergence of the series might be an assumption, but maybe that's part of what needs to be proven. Alternatively, if the problem is presented as an identity that WolframAlpha states, then perhaps the assumptions are that the series converges and that the manipulations are valid under standard mathematical assumptions. However, the user's example didn't include such implicit assumptions unless they were part of the problem's given conditions. \n\nWait, the example had the original problem stating \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they listed assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption included that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that might have been a mistake. Let me check the example again. \n\nOriginal problem in example: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems contradictory. Because if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. That seems like an error. So maybe the user's example might have a mistake, but perhaps the user intended that the formatted problem includes all necessary assumptions, even if the original problem didn't state them. Wait, maybe the original problem had a mistake? Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem in example: \"Prove that for every integer $n$, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\"\n\nFormatted problem's assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, if the original says \"for every integer n\", then the assumption should just be n is an integer. But in the formatted problem, there's an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Unless maybe in the original problem, there was a missing condition, but the user corrected it? Maybe the user made a mistake in the example. However, regardless, the instruction is to filter unrelated information and structure the problem with assumptions. So in the current problem, the Math Stack Exchange question is to prove the identity given. The user's example included assumptions even if they were part of the original problem's statement. So perhaps in this case, the assumptions would be that k is a positive integer (since the sum starts at k=1), and that ζ(2k) is the Riemann zeta function at even integers. However, since the problem is to prove the identity, maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond the definitions. But according to the example, even if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", the formatted assumptions list \"n is an integer\". So following that, here the sum is from k=1 to infinity, so k is a positive integer. Therefore, the assumption would be that k is a positive integer. But since k is the index of summation, that's part of the problem's statement. Maybe the assumption here is that the series converges, but since the problem is to prove the equality, perhaps that's part of the proof. Alternatively, if there are no explicit assumptions beyond the variables involved, maybe the assumptions are just the definitions of the terms. However, in the example, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\" which was not in the original problem. So perhaps the user's example has an error, but following their structure, perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions would include that k is a positive integer and ζ(s) is the Riemann zeta function. But I need to check if the original problem mentions any conditions. The original problem's title and question don't state any conditions on k except that the sum starts at k=1, so k is a positive integer. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- k is a positive integer.\n- ζ(2k) is the Riemann zeta function evaluated at even integers.\n\nBut the problem statement might not require these to be listed as assumptions because they are part of the problem's terms. However, following the user's example, where even if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", they list \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So, in this case, the sum is over k starting from 1 to infinity, so k is a positive integer. Thus, the assumption would be that k is a positive integer, and maybe that the series converges (but convergence might be part of what needs to be proven). Alternatively, since the identity is given by Wolfram Alpha, perhaps the convergence is assumed. \n\nTherefore, to structure the problem as per the example:\n\nAssumption:\n- k is a positive integer,\n- ζ(2k) denotes the Riemann zeta function at even integers,\n- The infinite series converges.\n\nProblem: Prove that\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)^{2}=1+\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{(2k-1)\\zeta(2k)}{2^{2k-1}}.\n$$\n\nBut wait, the original question in the body has a slightly different expression: 1 + 2 * sum_{k=1}^∞ [(2k-1)ζ(2k)/2^{2k}]. But as I noted earlier, 2 * [ ... /2^{2k} ] is equivalent to [...]/2^{2k -1}. So the two expressions are the same. The problem in the title and the problem in the body are equivalent. Therefore, the problem is to prove the identity as stated in the title.\n\nBut since the user's example included formatting the problem as given in the original, perhaps the problem statement should be exactly as written in the title. Let me check the original again:\n\nTitle: Proving that (π/2)^2 = 1 + sum_{k=1}^∞ [(2k-1)ζ(2k)/2^{2k-1}]\n\nQuestion body: WolframAlpha says (π/2)^2 = 1 + 2 * sum_{k=1}^∞ [(2k-1)ζ(2k)/2^{2k}], and asks how to prove it. So the user is referring to the version with the 2 multiplied, but that's equivalent to the title's version. Therefore, to follow the user's structure, perhaps we take the problem as stated in the title, since that's the original post's title, and the question body just rephrases it with an equivalent expression. So the problem to be formatted is as in the title.\n\nThus, the assumptions would be:\n\n- k is a positive integer,\n- ζ(2k) is the Riemann zeta function at 2k,\n- The infinite series converges (though this might be part of the proof),\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions are only those explicitly given in the problem. Since the problem as stated doesn't mention any conditions, but the sum is over k starting at 1, implying k is a positive integer. However, the user's example included \"n is an integer\" even though the problem stated \"for every integer n\". So following that pattern, here we can list:\n\nAssumption:\n- k is a positive integer.\n\nBut maybe that's redundant because the sum is from k=1 to infinity, so k is understood to be a positive integer. However, to follow the example, we list it. Also, ζ(2k) is the Riemann zeta function, which is defined for complex numbers with real part greater than 1, but here 2k is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, so ζ(2k) is valid. However, since the problem mentions ζ(2k), we can assume that's given. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- k is a positive integer,\n- ζ(s) denotes the Riemann zeta function.\n\nBut perhaps the problem doesn't need to assume that; it's part of the notation. Alternatively, the problem might not have any explicit assumptions beyond the variables involved. In the user's example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", which became an assumption \"n is an integer\". So following that, here the problem's sum is over k starting at 1, hence k is a positive integer, so the assumption is \"k is a positive integer\". The other part is that ζ(2k) is the Riemann zeta function, but that's part of the problem's statement, not an assumption. So perhaps the only assumption is that k is a positive integer. However, in the example, the user included \"n is divisible by 7\" which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, that seems like a mistake. Wait the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Maybe the example is wrong. But perhaps the user intended to include an additional assumption. Alternatively, maybe there was a misunderstanding. In any case, given that the user's example includes assumptions that might not be present in the original problem, I need to follow their format even if it's not logically accurate. But in the current problem, there are no such additional conditions. The problem is to prove an identity involving known functions and series. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- k is a positive integer.\n\nBut maybe even that is not necessary because it's part of the summation index. However, according to the example, if the original problem states \"for every integer n\", the assumption is \"n is an integer\". So here, since the sum is over k starting at 1, implying k is a positive integer, the assumption should be \"k is a positive integer\".\n\nAnother point: in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". This seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the original problem had a typo and should have said \"for every integer n divisible by 7\", but the user's example shows that the original problem said \"for every integer n\" but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like an error. However, since the user provided that example, perhaps they want to include all necessary assumptions, even if they are not explicitly stated. But in the current problem, there are no such hidden assumptions. The identity is supposed to hold as given. So perhaps the only assumption is that k is a positive integer, as part of the summation.\n\nAlternatively, there might be no assumptions needed, and the problem is as stated. But according to the user's format, we must list assumptions line by line. So if there are no explicit assumptions, perhaps the problem has none. But the example shows that even if the problem states \"for every integer n\", the formatted assumption lists \"n is an integer\". Therefore, following that, in the current problem, the sum is over k from 1 to infinity, so k is a positive integer. Therefore, the assumption is \"k is a positive integer\". \n\nThus, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- k is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)^{2}=1+\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{(2k-1)\\zeta(2k)}{2^{2k-1}}.\n$$\n\nBut wait, the problem in the question body has a factor of 2 in front of the sum, but the title has the sum without the 2 but with denominator 2^{2k-1}. Since these are equivalent, the problem can be stated as either. The title uses the version with 2^{2k-1} in the denominator, and the question body uses 2^{2k} with a factor of 2. To stick with the title's version, which is the original post's title, we'll use that. Therefore, the problem is as stated in the title.",
