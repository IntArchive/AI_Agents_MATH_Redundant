    "Content": "Let $S\\subseteq \\mathbb R^3$ be homeomorphic to $\\mathbb R$. Prove that $\\mathbb R^3 \\setminus S$ is connected. I haven't been able to solve this, although my topology skills are pretty weak. My friend told me he managed to prove this using results from his \"dimension topology\" class. Although I think this should be solvable using more mainstream stuff like homology or something. But I'm not sure. Regards.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "First: it is not reasonable to prove this with homology. Let's start with a story. Suppose $X$ is a subset of the sphere homeomorphic to $D^k$. Then Hatcher proves in proposition 2B.1 that $S^n \\setminus X$ has trivial reduced homology. (He also proves that if $X \\cong S^k$, then $S^n \\setminus X$ has the same reduced homology as $S^{n-k-1}$. This won't be as important to us.) The way the proof goes, roughly, is to use Mayer-Vietoris on the complement of $I^{k-1} \\times [0,1/2]$ and $I^{k-1} \\times [1/2, 1]$. If the homology isn't what we said above, we show the same is true for one of these sub-intervals, keep making the sub-intervals smaller, and then show that the homology of these complements ultimately reduces to the homology of $I^{k-1} \\times \\{p\\}$ (all, again, a sketch - see the actual proof.) It was essential that we used $I$ here, or else we wouldn't have access to the Mayer-Vietoris sequence - the complement of these sets is open! The same is not true for a copy of $\\Bbb R$. If the $\\Bbb R$ had closed image, you'd be able to access the problem with similar techniques (most easily by taking the one-point-compactification and thinking of this as the complement of an $S^1$ in $S^3$ and using the above technique). You might want to say \"OK, well there they took a nested intersection of intervals and looked at their complement. We know the result works for embeddings of $[0,1]$. Why don't we try to take a nested union instead?\" This does not work - just think about the union of discs on the $xy$-plane of increasing radius! Clearly their complements are path-connected but their increasing union is not. So there's something special going on about the 1-dimensionality of the line. (Note, by the way, that FINITE unions are easy to deal with via the Mayer-Vietoris sequence. Indeed it's not hard to show using the above facts that the complement of any $n-2$-dimensional finite simplicial complex embedded in $\\Bbb R^n$ is path-connected.) Even the most souped-up duality theorems, like Alexander duality in Cech cohomology, need to assume compactness (even if they can drop local contractibility!) After all, consider the embedding of a copy of $\\Bbb R$ inside the 2-sphere that winds around an annulus, with limit set $|z| = 1$ and $|z| = 3$. Then it has three path-components, which no form of duality could expect. OK, so how do we deal with this? We, like your friend said, use dimension theory. I don't know this stuff very well, so I'm going to cite it away. (I don't have access to Hurewicz-Wallman right now, but when I do, I'll offer a more precise reference.) This MO comment says that the space of paths from $x$ to $y$ not in some compact 1-dimensional subspace of $\\Bbb R^3$ is open and dense in the space of paths from $x$ to $y$, and this answer implies that the image of any unit interval in $\\Bbb R^3$ is 1-dimensional. Now apply the Baire Category theorem to the subset $U_n \\subset \\mathcal P(x,y)$, where $U_n$ is the set of maps that miss $[n,n+1]$ in your embedding of $\\Bbb R$. Because $\\mathcal P(x,y)$ is a complete metric space with the supremum metric, it is a Baire space, and hence $\\bigcap_{n \\in \\Bbb Z} U_n$ is nonempty (and, in fact, dense). Thus we conclude.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's start by looking at the original problem from Math Stack Exchange. The user wants to prove that if you remove a subset S from R³, and S is homeomorphic to R, then the resulting space R³ \\ S is connected. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that S is a subset of R³ and is homeomorphic to R. So the key assumptions here are about the properties of S. Let me break that down. The first assumption is that S is a subset of R³. The second is that S is homeomorphic to R, which means it's a topological line, not necessarily a straight line but something that can be continuously deformed into a line.\n\nThe problem then is to prove that removing such an S from R³ leaves a connected space. The user mentioned they have weak topology skills and their friend used dimension theory, but they think homology might work. But the task here isn't to solve it, just to structure the problem correctly.\n\nLooking at the example provided, assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. In the example, n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, S is a subset of R³, and S is homeomorphic to R. Those are two separate assumptions. \n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem included \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added the assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Wait, no, maybe the user provided an example where they restructured the problem, possibly filtering out some info. But perhaps in the original problem, maybe the user had an error, but in the given example, the formatted problem includes that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but perhaps the example was incorrect? Wait, maybe the example was a different problem. Let me check again.\n\nThe example original problem was: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems conflicting because the original says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. But maybe the user intended to show that sometimes assumptions are extracted even if they modify the original problem. Hmm, perhaps the example was a bad one, but regardless, I need to follow the instructions.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's original question is about proving that R³ minus S is connected, given S is homeomorphic to R. The assumptions would be:\n\n1. S is a subset of R³.\n2. S is homeomorphic to R.\n\nEach assumption is about one property of S. The problem is to prove R³ \\ S is connected.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have those two assumptions, each on their own line, and the problem statement. The user's question includes some extra info about their friend using dimension topology and them thinking of homology, but those are irrelevant to structuring the problem. So we filter those out.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nS is a subset of ℝ³,\nS is homeomorphic to ℝ.\nProblem:\nProve that ℝ³ \\ S is connected.",
