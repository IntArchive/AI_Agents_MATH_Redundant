    "Content": "Following the guidelines suggested in this meta discussion , I am going to post a proposed proof as an answer to the theorem below. I believe the proof works, but would appreciate any needed corrections. Theorem If a series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}a_n$ of real numbers converges then $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty}a_n = 0$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Proof If the series converges to the number $L$, this means that the sequence of partial sums converges to $L$, that is,\n$$\n\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sum_{k=1}^n a_k = L.\n$$ But, $$\n\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sum_{k=1}^n a_k = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty}\\left( a_n + \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} a_k  \\right) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty}a_n + \\lim_{n \\to \\infty}  \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} a_k,\n$$\nhowever, as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$, the partial sum\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} a_k\n$$\nalso converges to $L$. Therefore, the second equation can be rewritten as\n$$\nL = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} a_n + L \\implies \\lim_{n \\to \\infty}a_n = 0 \n$$\n$\\square$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual math professor, read a question from Math Stack Exchange, filter out unrelated info, and structure it into the specified format. The example they gave shows how assumptions are listed and the problem is stated clearly.\n\nLooking at the example, the original problem was about proving that A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted version listed two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Then the problem statement was simplified.\n\nNow, the current problem from Math Stack Exchange is titled \"If a series converges, then the sequence of terms converges to $0$.\" The question is about proving that if the series ∑a_n converges, then the limit of a_n as n approaches infinity is 0. The user mentions a proposed proof and asks for corrections, but the main task is to structure the problem, not address the proof.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The theorem states that if a series converges, then the sequence of terms goes to 0. The key assumptions here would be:\n\n1. The series ∑_{n=1}^∞ a_n converges. (This is the main condition given in the theorem.)\n2. The terms a_n are real numbers. (Mentioned in the theorem statement.)\n\nThe problem is to prove that under these assumptions, lim_{n→∞} a_n = 0.\n\nI need to list each assumption line by line. The original problem doesn't mention any additional conditions like specific types of convergence or other constraints on a_n beyond being real. So the assumptions should just be the convergence of the series and the terms being real.\n\nWait, in the example given by the user, the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7, but the formatted problem added it as an assumption. Wait, no, looking back, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like a mistake. Because if the original problem is for every integer n, then the assumption shouldn't restrict n to being divisible by 7. Unless there was a typo in the example. Wait, maybe the example was a different problem? Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91. Formatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that's conflicting. Unless there was a mistake in the example. Because if the original problem is for every integer n, then adding that n is divisible by 7 would be an extra assumption not present in the original. That seems incorrect. But perhaps the user provided an incorrect example. Hmm, but regardless, I need to follow the current problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the theorem is: If a series ∑a_n converges, then lim a_n =0. So the assumptions are that the series converges, and the terms are real numbers. The problem is to prove the conclusion.\n\nSo the formatted problem should list:\n\nAssumption: The series ∑_{n=1}^∞ a_n of real numbers converges.\n\nAssumption: Each term a_n is a real number.\n\nBut wait, in the theorem statement, it's written as \"a series ∑_{n=1}^∞ a_n of real numbers converges\". So the conditions are that it's a series of real numbers and that it converges. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. The series ∑_{n=1}^∞ a_n is a series of real numbers.\n\n2. The series ∑_{n=1}^∞ a_n converges.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that lim_{n→∞} a_n =0.\n\nBut in the example, the user split assumptions into separate lines, each addressing one property applied to one object. So here, \"the series is of real numbers\" and \"the series converges\" are two separate assumptions. Therefore, the formatted problem should list both.\n\nWait, but the original theorem states \"If a series ∑_{n=1}^∞ a_n of real numbers converges...\", so the fact that it's a series of real numbers is part of the hypothesis. So both are necessary assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The series ∑_{n=1}^∞ a_n is composed of real numbers.\n\n- The series ∑_{n=1}^∞ a_n converges.\n\nProblem: Prove that lim_{n→∞} a_n =0.\n\nI think that's correct. The user's example might have had a mistake, but following the current problem's structure, this should be right.",
