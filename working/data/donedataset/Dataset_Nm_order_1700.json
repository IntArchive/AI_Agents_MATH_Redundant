    "Content": "Let $B=\\{x\\in\\mathbb R^n : ||x||<1\\}$ the open unit ball with the subapce topology of $\\mathbb R^n$. I want to show that $B^n\\cong\\mathbb R^n$ with the map $F(x)=\\tan(\\frac{\\pi ||x||}{2})\\frac{x}{||x||}$ for $x\\not=0$ and $F(0)=0$ Well $\\frac{x}{||x||}$ is more or less the direction of the vector $x$, the norm is a number out of $[0,1)$ and the scaled tangent is a Homeomorphism from $[0,1)$ to the positive real numbers. I want to show that $F(x)$ is contionous, bijective and there is an inverse map. Injectivity : Let $F(x)=F(y)\\leftrightarrow ||F(x)||=||F(y)||\\leftrightarrow \\tan(\\frac{\\pi ||x||}{2})||\\frac{x}{||x||}||=\\tan(\\frac{\\pi ||y||}{2})||\\frac{y}{||y||}||$ I know that the tangent is injective but I do not see how $x=y$ can be followed. Surjectivity : Let $y\\in\\mathbb R^n$, now I need to show $\\exists x\\in B^n: F(x)=y$, i.e $\\tan(\\frac{\\pi ||x||}{2})\\frac{x}{||x||}=y$ I do not see how surjectivity can be followed form this. Inverse map : I know that the tangent has an inverse map, namely the arctangent, but how can this be used here? Continuity : Well I know that the tangent is only contin. on $\\mathbb R\\setminus\\{(n+\\frac{1}{2})\\pi: n\\in \\mathbb Z\\}$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Injectivity $F(x)=F(y)$, with $x\\ne0$ and $y\\ne0$ means $$\n\\tan\\biggl(\\frac{\\pi \\|x\\|}{2}\\biggr)\\frac{x}{\\|x\\|}=\n\\tan\\biggl(\\frac{\\pi \\|y\\|}{2}\\biggr)\\frac{y}{\\|y\\|}\n$$ So we can assume $x\\ne0$ and $y\\ne0$. Then, taking norms, \n$$\n\\tan\\biggl(\\frac{\\pi \\|x\\|}{2}\\biggr)=\\tan\\biggl(\\frac{\\pi \\|y\\|}{2}\\biggr)\n$$\nbecause $x/\\|x\\|$ has norm $1$ and the same for $y/\\|y\\|$; moreover $\\tan t>0$ if $t>0$. By the injectivity of the tangent you get\n$$\n\\frac{\\pi \\|x\\|}{2}=\\frac{\\pi \\|y\\|}{2}\n$$\nso $\\|x\\|=\\|y\\|$ and, finally $x=y$. It's clear that $F(x)=0$ if and only if $x=0$, so the proof is complete. Surjectivity $0=F(0)$, so we only need to show that, for $z\\ne0$, we can find $x$ with $F(x)=z$. We should have\n$$\nz=\\tan\\biggl(\\frac{\\pi \\|x\\|}{2}\\biggr)\\frac{x}{\\|x\\|}\n$$\nso\n$$\n\\|z\\|=\\tan\\biggl(\\frac{\\pi \\|x\\|}{2}\\biggr)\n$$\nhence\n$$\n\\frac{\\pi\\|x\\|}{2}=\\arctan\\|z\\|\n$$\nthat is,\n$$\n\\|x\\|=\\frac{2\\arctan\\|z\\|}{\\pi}.\n$$\nThus the candidate is\n$$\nx=\\frac{2\\arctan\\|z\\|}{\\pi\\|z\\|}z\n$$\nVerify it's the right one. Continuity The continuity of $F$ is obvious in the points different from $0$, because it's obtained by continuous functions. Since your domain consists of vectors with norm $<1$, there's no problem with the tangent function, because you consider only arguments in $(0,\\pi/2)$. The continuity of the inverse is obvious as well \noutside $0$ Are $F$ and its inverse continuous at $0$? A well known fact is that $\\lim_{x\\to0}F(x)=0$ if and only if $\\lim_{x\\to0}\\|F(x)\\|=0$; now\n$$\n\\|F(x)\\|=\\biggl\\|\\tan\\biggl(\\frac{\\pi\\|x\\|}{2}\\biggr)\\frac{x}{\\|x\\|}\\biggr\\|\n=\\tan\\biggl(\\frac{\\pi\\|x\\|}{2}\\biggr)\n$$\nthat obviously satisfies the requested property. The same for the continuity at $0$ of $F^{-1}$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about showing that the open unit ball B in R^n is homeomorphic to R^n using a specific map F(x). The user is asking for help with proving that F is continuous, bijective, and has an inverse. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. Each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. Let me parse through the problem:\n\n1. The open unit ball B is defined as {x in R^n : ||x|| < 1} with the subspace topology from R^n.\n2. The map F is defined as F(x) = tan(π||x||/2) * (x/||x||) for x ≠ 0, and F(0) = 0.\n3. The user mentions that the norm ||x|| is in [0,1), and tan(π||x||/2) scales it to positive reals. They want to show F is a homeomorphism.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- B is the open unit ball in R^n with subspace topology.\n- F: B → R^n is defined by F(0) = 0 and F(x) = tan(π||x||/2)(x/||x||) for x ≠ 0.\n- The goal is to prove F is a homeomorphism (i.e., continuous, bijective, with continuous inverse).\n\nWait, the problem statement in the original includes the user's attempts, but the task is to filter out unrelated info. The core problem is to show B is homeomorphic to R^n via the given F. The user's specific points about injectivity, surjectivity, inverse, and continuity are their attempts, which might be considered part of the problem, but according to the example, we should structure the problem without the user's attempts. The example extracted the original problem's assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nLooking back at the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But in the formatted problem, only the necessary assumptions were listed. So here, the key assumptions are:\n\n- B is the open unit ball in R^n with subspace topology.\n- The function F is defined as specified.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to show that F is a homeomorphism. So the assumptions are the definitions of B and F. Then the problem is to prove F is a homeomorphism.\n\nBut the user also mentions they need to show F is continuous, bijective, and has an inverse. But in the problem statement, maybe we just need to state the main problem, which is proving the homeomorphism using F.\n\nSo the Assumptions would be:\n\n- B is the open unit ball in R^n, i.e., B = {x ∈ R^n : ||x|| < 1} with subspace topology.\n- F: B → R^n is defined by F(0) = 0 and for x ≠ 0, F(x) = tan(π||x||/2) * (x/||x||).\n\nProblem: Prove that F is a homeomorphism between B and R^n.\n\nBut wait, in the original problem, the user says \"I want to show that B^n ≅ R^n with the map F\". So the problem is to prove that F is a homeomorphism. The assumptions are the definitions of B and F. The user's specific questions about injectivity, surjectivity, etc., are part of their attempt, which we need to exclude.\n\nSo following the example, the formatted problem should list the assumptions and the problem statement. The example included an assumption that n is an integer (from the original problem's \"for every integer n\") and another assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the user structured the assumption as n being an integer and divisible by 7. But in the original problem, there was no assumption that n is divisible by 7; it was to prove for every integer n. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect? Wait, no. Wait, in the example given by the user, the original problem states \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem lists assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" That seems contradictory. Wait, maybe there was a mistake in the example. But perhaps the user intended to show how to structure, but maybe there was a confusion. Anyway, perhaps the example is correct, but for the current problem, I need to focus on the actual question.\n\nBack to the current problem. The problem is to show that the open unit ball B is homeomorphic to R^n via the given map F. So the assumptions are the definitions of B and F. Therefore, the Assumption section should list:\n\n- B is the open unit ball in R^n with the subspace topology.\n- F: B → R^n is defined by F(0) = 0 and F(x) = tan(π||x||/2)(x/||x||) for x ≠ 0.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that F is a homeomorphism.\n\nBut maybe we need to break down each assumption line by line, each for one object or condition.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\n- B is the open unit ball in R^n, defined as {x ∈ R^n : ||x|| < 1}.\n- B is equipped with the subspace topology inherited from R^n.\n- F: B → R^n is a function defined by F(0) = 0.\n- For x ≠ 0 in B, F(x) = tan(π||x||/2) * (x/||x||).\n\nProblem:\nProve that F is a homeomorphism between B and R^n.\n\nThat should be the structured problem. The user's own attempts about injectivity, surjectivity, etc., are part of their thought process but not part of the problem statement. Therefore, they should be filtered out.",
