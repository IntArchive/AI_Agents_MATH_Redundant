    "AcceptedAnswer": "The point is that if $\\alpha\\in\\mathbb{Q}^+$ and $C>2$, there is at most a finite number of rational numbers $\\frac{p}{q}$ such that:\n$$ \\left|\\alpha-\\frac{p}{q}\\right|\\leq\\frac{1}{q^C}. \\tag{1}$$\nSo, if $\\left\\{\\frac{p_n}{q_n}\\right\\}_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ is a sequence of rational approximations of $\\zeta(3)$ such that $(1)$ holds for every element of the sequence, $\\zeta(3)\\not\\in\\mathbb{Q}$. The problem boils down to finding \"good\" approximations for $\\zeta(3)$. This can be done, more or less, by considering a sequence of integrals:\n$$ I_n = \\int_{-1}^{1} P_n(x)\\,f(x)\\,dx = \\zeta(3)-\\frac{p_n}{q_n} \\tag{2} $$\nwhere $P_n$ is a Legendre polynomial. To estimate the size of the LHS is not a difficult task, but in order to estimate the size of $q_n$, too, it really useful to know that $q_1,q_2,\\ldots$ satisfy some recursive formula. Given the formula, we may compute the magnitude of $q_n$ and hope that $(1)$ holds for some $C>2$ and for an infinite number of $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$, proving irrationality. This is far from being an algorithmic approach: there are many well-known cases in which something goes wrong: the Euler-Mascheroni constant $\\gamma$, the next interesting value of the $\\zeta$ function, $\\zeta(5)$, and so on. Apery was very fond of his proof, and we may figure why: it is almost a miracle.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that I need to list assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to a single object, then state the problem clearly.\n\nFirst, the original question is about proving that ζ(3) is irrational, specifically referencing Apéry's method. The example given in the problem had an assumption about n being an integer and divisible by 7. But in this case, the question is about ζ(3)'s irrationality. I need to check if there are any implicit assumptions in the original question.\n\nThe original question mentions \"how Apery did it\" and refers to a recursion leading to irrationality. Apéry's proof is famous for using a specific recursive sequence to demonstrate the irrationality of ζ(3). So, possible assumptions here might relate to properties of ζ(3), the methods used by Apéry, such as the recursion in the sequences he used, or perhaps that ζ(3) is a real number. However, ζ(3) is already known to be a real number as it's a series converging to a real value. The main point is proving its irrationality.\n\nBut wait, the example included assumptions that were part of the problem's conditions. In the original problem example, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7. For the current problem, the question is how to prove ζ(3) is irrational using Apéry's method, particularly focusing on how recursion leads to irrationality. Are there any explicit assumptions in the problem statement? The user is asking about the method, so maybe the assumptions are about the properties of the sequences Apéry used. For instance, the existence of a recursive sequence that approximates ζ(3) in such a way that the recursion implies irrationality. However, the problem as stated doesn't list any explicit conditions; it's a general proof request.\n\nIn the example, the assumptions were part of the problem's given conditions. Here, the problem is to prove a specific number's irrationality, so the main assumption is that ζ(3) is a real number (which it is, as the series converges), but that might be too trivial. Alternatively, maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond the definition of ζ(3). Since the problem is about the method (Apéry's proof), perhaps the assumptions are related to the tools used in that proof, like the recursive sequences or the properties they satisfy. However, the original problem statement doesn't specify any; it's a general question about the proof method.\n\nWait, the example had the user incorrectly including an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem, that wasn't stated. Wait, looking back at the example: the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, the user provided an example where they restructured the problem, but in their formatted version, they added an assumption not present in the original. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted version adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Maybe the user made an error in their example. Because if the original problem states \"for every integer n\", then there's no assumption that n is divisible by 7. So perhaps the example is incorrect, but following the user's instructions, they want to filter unrelated information and list assumptions. However, in this case, the problem about ζ(3) might not have explicit assumptions beyond the definition of ζ(3). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to understand the steps in Apéry's proof, which involves certain sequences with recursion. But the user's question is \"How does one prove that ζ(3) is irrational?\" with a focus on the recursion part. So perhaps the assumptions are related to the sequences used by Apéry. For example, the existence of integer sequences satisfying certain recursions that bound the approximation rate, leading to a contradiction unless ζ(3) is irrational. But the problem statement as given doesn't list these; the user is asking for an explanation of the method.\n\nTherefore, in the formatted problem, since there are no explicit assumptions in the original question beyond ζ(3) being a real number (which is inherent), but that's too trivial. Alternatively, perhaps there are no assumptions needed here, and the problem is simply to prove ζ(3)'s irrationality using Apéry's method. However, the example had assumptions listed even when the original problem didn't mention them (like n divisible by 7), which might have been a mistake. So maybe in this case, there are no specific assumptions to list, and the problem is just as stated. But the user's example shows that sometimes they include assumptions even if they aren't in the original problem. Wait, the original example problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted version added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", not just those divisible by 7. So maybe the example provided by the user is flawed, and their actual intention is different. Perhaps the user wants to extract implicit assumptions from the problem. But in that case, for the ζ(3) problem, the only assumption is that ζ(3) is defined, which is trivial.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants to structure the problem by listing the key components needed for the proof as assumptions. But that's not standard. Assumptions are usually given conditions in the problem. Since the problem is to prove ζ(3) is irrational, the only assumption is that ζ(3) is a real number (which it is), but that's not necessary to state. Alternatively, maybe there are no assumptions, and the problem is just the statement. However, the example had assumptions listed even if they weren't in the original problem. This is confusing. Maybe the user wants to list any underlying assumptions necessary to approach the problem, but that's speculative. \n\nGiven the confusion from the example, perhaps the correct approach here is to list ζ(3) as the Riemann zeta function at 3, but that's part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Alternatively, if the problem is to use Apéry's method, the assumption could be that certain recursive sequences exist, but that's part of the method, not the problem's assumption. \n\nGiven the ambiguity in the example, perhaps the user expects that even if the original problem doesn't state assumptions, we should infer them. But in the case of proving ζ(3) is irrational, there are no explicit assumptions beyond ζ(3) being the Riemann zeta function at 3. Therefore, the formatted problem should have the problem statement and no assumptions. But the example shows that even when the original problem doesn't have assumptions, the formatted version includes them. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which is incorrect. That suggests that the example might have been a mistake. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended that in the example, the original problem had a mistake, and the formatted version corrected it by adding the necessary assumption. But that's not clear. Given this confusion, perhaps for the current problem, since there are no explicit assumptions given in the question, the Assumption section would be empty, but according to the format, we need to list assumptions. However, the example shows that even if the original problem doesn't have assumptions, the formatted version includes some. So maybe the user wants to structure the problem by extracting any conditions or properties mentioned. \n\nLooking at the current question: \"How does one prove that ζ(3) is irrational? I would like to know how Apery did it. In particular how a recursion gives rise to irrationality !?\" \n\nThe key points here are ζ(3), Apéry's proof, recursion leading to irrationality. The assumptions here might be implicit in Apéry's method, such as the existence of certain recursive sequences or the properties of ζ(3). But since the problem is asking for the method, not stating a problem with given conditions, it's challenging to list assumptions. Perhaps the assumption is that ζ(3) is a real number (trivial), and the problem is to prove its irrationality using Apéry's method involving recursion. Alternatively, maybe there are no assumptions, and the problem is simply as stated. \n\nGiven the example provided by the user seems to include incorrect assumptions, perhaps they expect that assumptions are the conditions necessary for the proof. For example, in Apéry's proof, one uses sequences of integers satisfying linear recursions with integer coefficients, and the convergence rate leading to a contradiction. But those are part of the proof steps, not assumptions of the problem. \n\nTherefore, after considering all this, perhaps the correct way to format this problem is to list ζ(3) as the Riemann zeta function evaluated at 3 as the only assumption, and the problem is to prove its irrationality using Apéry's method, focusing on how recursion leads to the conclusion. But since ζ(3) is defined as a series, that's part of the problem statement. However, in the example, the assumption was about n being an integer, which was part of the problem's original statement. So perhaps here, the assumption is that ζ(3) is defined by the series sum_{n=1}^infty 1/n^3. But again, that's part of the problem statement, not an assumption. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, and following the example where assumptions were listed even if not explicitly in the problem, perhaps the answer should have:\n\nAssumption: ζ(3) is the Riemann zeta function evaluated at 3.\n\nProblem: Prove that ζ(3) is irrational using Apéry's method, particularly how a recursion gives rise to irrationality.\n\nAlternatively, if no assumptions are needed, just state the problem. But according to the example, even if the original problem didn't have assumptions, the formatted version added some. Since the example might be incorrect, but we have to follow the user's instruction, maybe in this case, since there are no explicit assumptions given, we list none. However, the format requires listing assumptions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user considers that the problem is about Apéry's proof, so the assumptions are the steps or lemmas Apéry used. But that's part of the proof, not the problem's assumptions. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, but adhering to the example where the original problem's conditions were turned into assumptions (even if the example was flawed), perhaps here the assumption is simply that ζ(3) is the value in question, and the problem is to prove its irrationality via Apéry's method. Therefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption: ζ(3) is the Riemann zeta function evaluated at 3.\n\nProblem: Prove that ζ(3) is irrational, particularly explaining how a recursion in Apéry's method gives rise to the proof of irrationality.\n\nBut since ζ(3) is defined as the sum, which is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Maybe the assumption is that the Riemann zeta function is defined as usual. But that's too basic. Alternatively, no assumptions, but the format requires at least one. Therefore, perhaps:\n\nAssumption: (none, but the format requires it, so maybe leave it empty) However, the example shows that even if the original problem didn't have assumptions, they were added. Since the user's example might be incorrect, but we have to proceed, perhaps list ζ(3) as the Riemann zeta function at 3 as the assumption.\n\nBut I think the correct approach here is to realize that the original problem is a general proof question, so there are no specific assumptions other than the definition of ζ(3). Hence, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption: ζ(3) is defined as the sum of the reciprocals of the cubes of the positive integers.\n\nProblem: Prove that ζ(3) is irrational using Apéry's method, focusing on how the recursion in his proof leads to the conclusion of irrationality.\n\nYes, this seems reasonable. The assumption is clarifying what ζ(3) is, which is part of the problem setup. The problem is to prove its irrationality via Apéry's method, with emphasis on the recursion aspect.",
