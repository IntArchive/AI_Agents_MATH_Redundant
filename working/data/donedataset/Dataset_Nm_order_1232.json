    "Content": "I have been asking the following question at MSE with an answer: $\\lfloor \\sqrt n+\\sqrt {n+1}+\\sqrt{n+2}+\\sqrt{n+3}+\\sqrt{n+4}\\rfloor=\\lfloor\\sqrt {25n+49}\\rfloor$ is true? I found this relational expression by using computer. Then, I got interested in the generalization of this expression. After receiving an answer, I decided to start an easy example. First, I got the following with a proof:\n$$\\lfloor\\sqrt n+\\sqrt {n+1}\\rfloor=\\lfloor\\sqrt {4n+1}\\rfloor=\\lfloor\\sqrt{4n+2}\\rfloor.$$ Note that $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is the largest integer not greater than $x$. Proof : By the AM-GM inequality, we get $n\\lt\\sqrt{n(n+1)}\\lt n+1/2$. Then, we get\n$$4n+1\\lt\\left(\\sqrt n+\\sqrt{n+1}\\right)^2=4n+2-2\\left(n+1/2-\\sqrt{n(n+1)}\\right)\\lt4n+2.\n$$\nBy the way, there are no perfect squares in $\\left(4n+1, 4n+2\\right].$ (since $k^2\\equiv0, 1(mod 4)$ for any natural number $k$, there is no natural number $k$ such that $k^2=4n+2$.) Now, the proof is completed. Second, I've just got new relational expressions by using computer:\n$$\\lfloor\\sqrt{n}+\\sqrt{n+1}+\\sqrt{n+2}\\rfloor=\\lfloor\\sqrt{9n+8}\\rfloor,$$\n$$\\lfloor\\sqrt{n}+\\sqrt{n+1}+\\sqrt{n+2}+\\sqrt{n+3}\\rfloor=\\lfloor\\sqrt{16n+20}\\rfloor$$\nfor any natural numbre $n$. I won't ask these expression because I'm going to prove these by myself. Third, I haven't got any expression about 'six terms expression'.\nThen, I expect the following theorem would be proven true: Theorem : For any real number $c$, there exists a natural number $n$ such that\n$$\\lfloor\\sqrt{n}+\\sqrt{n+1}+\\sqrt{n+2}+\\sqrt{n+3}+\\sqrt{n+4}+\\sqrt{n+5}\\rfloor\\not=\\lfloor\\sqrt{36n+c}\\rfloor.$$ Then, here is my question. Question : The theorem I wrote is true? If it is true, please show me how to prove it. If it is not true, please give me a counterexample. Any help would be appriciated.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $g(n)=\\sqrt n+\\sqrt{n+1}+\\ldots+\\sqrt{n+5} $ and $f(n)=\\lfloor g(n)\\rfloor$.\nWhen searching for a $c$ such that \n$$f(n) = \\lfloor \\sqrt{36n+c}\\rfloor $$\nfor all $n$,\neach $n$ gives us some conditions on $c$, namely that \n$$f(n)\\le\\sqrt{36n+c}<f(n)+1 $$\nthat is\n$$\\tag1f(n)^2-36n\\le c<(f(n)+1)^2-36n.$$\nThis way, $n=1$ gives us $64\\le c<85$ and $n=11$ gives us $88\\le c<133$. Since these inequalites contradict each other, no $c$ works for all $n$, thus your theorem is true. We can find suitable $c$ if we are allowed to ignore the first few values of $n$: Note that for $k>0$ $$\\sqrt{n+k}-\\sqrt{n}=\\frac{k}{\\sqrt{n+k}+\\sqrt n}\\in\\left(\\frac{k}{2\\sqrt{n+k}},\\frac{k}{2\\sqrt{n}}\\right),$$\nhence \n$$ 6\\sqrt n+\\frac{15}{2\\sqrt{n+5}}<g(n) <6\\sqrt n+\\frac{15}{2\\sqrt n}$$\nand \n$$\\tag236n+90\\sqrt{\\frac{n}{n+5}}+\\frac{225}{4(n+5)}< g(n)^2<36n+90+\\frac{225}{4n}.$$\nAssume $n\\ge20$, so that $4(n+5)\\le 5n$.\nFrom $\\sqrt{1+\\frac 5n}<1+\\frac{5}{2n}$ we have $\\sqrt{\\frac{n}{n+5}}>\\frac1{1+\\frac5{2n}}>1-\\frac5{2n}$, so the left hand side of (2) becomes\n$$ g(n)^2>36n+90\\left(1-\\frac5{2n}\\right)+\\frac{45}{n}=36n+90-\\frac{180}{n}.$$\nThus for $n>180$ we have $\\sqrt{36n+89}<g(n)<\\sqrt{36n+91}$ and hence\n$$ f(n)\\in\\bigl\\{\\lfloor\\sqrt{36n+89} \\rfloor,\\lfloor\\sqrt{36n+90} \\rfloor,\\lfloor\\sqrt{36n+91} \\rfloor\\bigr\\}.$$\nSince $36n+90$ and $36n+91$ cannot be perfect squares ($x^2\\equiv 18\\pmod{36}$ and $x^2\\equiv 19\\pmod{36}$ have no solutions), we conclude \n$$ f(n)=\\lfloor\\sqrt{36n+89} \\rfloor=\\lfloor\\sqrt{36n+90} \\rfloor=\\lfloor\\sqrt{36n+91} \\rfloor$$\nat least for $n>180$, and by inspection for all $n>3$. Remark: The above computations also suggest which value of $c$ we shold check in the general case:\nSimilar as above we find that\n$$ \\sqrt n+\\ldots +\\sqrt{n+k}\\approx (k+1)\\sqrt n+\\frac{0+1+\\ldots +k)}{2\\sqrt n}=(k+1)\\sqrt n+\\frac{k(k+1)}{4\\sqrt n}$$\nand therefore \n$$ \\left(\\sqrt n+\\ldots +\\sqrt{n+k}\\right)^2\\approx (k+1)^2n+\\frac{k(k+1)^2}{2}.$$\nFurther details depend on whether the integers near $\\frac{k(k+1)^2}{2}$ are squares modulo $(k+1)^2$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to understand this problem. The user is talking about a generalization of a floor function involving square roots. The original problem they mentioned was about the sum of five consecutive square roots and how it's equal to the floor of the square root of 25n + 49. Then they proved some smaller cases with two, three, and four terms. Now, they're looking at six terms and wondering if there's a constant c such that the floor of the sum of six square roots from √n to √(n+5) equals the floor of √(36n + c) for all natural numbers n. If such a c doesn't exist, they want to prove that for any c, there's some n where the equality fails.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question correctly. The user has a theorem they conjecture: For any real number c, there exists a natural number n such that the floor of the sum of six square roots (from n to n+5) is not equal to the floor of sqrt(36n + c). They want to know if this theorem is true. If yes, prove it; if not, provide a counterexample.\n\nSo the task is to determine whether such a c exists that makes the equation hold for all n, or to show that no matter what c you choose, there will always be some n that breaks it. The user is suggesting that the theorem is true (i.e., such c doesn't exist), and they want confirmation.\n\nTo approach this, I recall that in the previous cases with 2, 3, 4, and 5 terms, there exists a c such that the floor of the sum equals the floor of sqrt(k²n + c), where k is the number of terms. For example, 2 terms had 4n +1, which is (2²)n +1; five terms had 25n +49, which is 5²n +49. So the pattern seems to be k²n plus some constant. The question is whether for six terms, there's a c such that the sum of six square roots from n to n+5 is between sqrt(36n + c) and sqrt(36n + c +1), such that their floors are equal.\n\nBut the user is asserting that for six terms, no such c exists. So the theorem they propose is that for any c, there's some n where the floors differ. To prove this, one might need to show that the difference between the sum of the square roots and sqrt(36n + c) can be made to cross an integer boundary for some n, thereby making their floors differ.\n\nAlternatively, if it's possible to find a c where the sum is always within [sqrt(36n + c), sqrt(36n + c +1)), then the theorem is false. But the user thinks it's true, so likely such c doesn't exist.\n\nTo structure the problem, we need to list assumptions. The original problem mentions \"for any real number c\" and \"there exists a natural number n\" such that the floors are not equal. The problem is to prove whether this theorem is true.\n\nAssumptions would be:\n\n- n is a natural number.\n- c is a real number.\n- The floor function is considered for the sum of six square roots and for sqrt(36n + c).\n\nThe problem statement is: Prove or disprove that for any real number c, there exists a natural number n such that ⌊√n + √(n+1) + √(n+2) + √(n+3) + √(n+4) + √(n+5)⌋ ≠ ⌊√(36n + c)⌋.\n\nBut in the original question, the user phrased their theorem as: For any real number c, there exists a natural number n such that the floors are not equal. So the problem is to determine the truth of this statement.\n\nSo, in the formatted problem, the assumptions would include the definitions of the floor function, that n is a natural number, and that c is a real number. But since the problem is about the existence of such an n for any c, the key assumptions are about the variables involved.\n\nWait, but the original problem's theorem states: For any real c, there exists a natural n such that the floors are unequal. So the assumptions are that c is any real number, n is a natural number, and the problem is to prove that such an n exists for any c.\n\nTherefore, structuring the assumptions line by line:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- $c$ is a real number.\n\n- $n$ is a natural number.\n\n- $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$.\n\nProblem: Prove that for any real number $c$, there exists a natural number $n$ such that $$\\lfloor\\sqrt{n}+\\sqrt{n+1}+\\sqrt{n+2}+\\sqrt{n+3}+\\sqrt{n+4}+\\sqrt{n+5}\\rfloor \\neq \\lfloor\\sqrt{36n + c}\\rfloor.$$\n\nChecking the example provided in the original instruction, the assumptions are listed as separate lines, each addressing one property. So here, each line should mention one condition. So $c$ is real, $n$ is natural, and the floor function's definition.\n\nSo the formatted problem would look like:\n\nAssumption:\n\n$c$ is a real number,\n\n$n$ is a natural number,\n\n$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$.\n\nProblem: Prove that for any real number $c$, there exists a natural number $n$ such that $$\\lfloor\\sqrt{n}+\\sqrt{n+1}+\\sqrt{n+2}+\\sqrt{n+3}+\\sqrt{n+4}+\\sqrt{n+5}\\rfloor \\neq \\lfloor\\sqrt{36n + c}\\rfloor.$$\n\nThat should capture the necessary assumptions and the problem statement correctly.",
