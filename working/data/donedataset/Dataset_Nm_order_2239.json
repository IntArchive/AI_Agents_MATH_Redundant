    "Content": "Let $\\mu$ be a Borel measure on $X$ and $T: X \\rightarrow Y$ a Borel map ($Y$ topological space). I define $$ T _* \\mu(E) = \\mu(T^{-1}(E))  \\qquad \\forall E \\subset Y \\quad \\text{Borel} $$\nIt is easy to prove that $T_* \\mu$ is a measure on $Y$.

    "AcceptedAnswer": "First consider $f=1_E$ for some Borel set $E \\subseteq Y$. Note that $$1_{T^{-1}(E)}(x)= 1 \\Leftrightarrow x \\in T^{-1}(E) \\Leftrightarrow T(x) \\in E \\Leftrightarrow 1_{E}(T(x))=1 \\tag{1} $$\nThus $$\\int_Y f \\, dT_{\\ast} \\mu = T_{\\ast} \\mu(E) \\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=} \\mu(T^{-1}(E)) = \\int 1_{T^{-1}(E)}(x) \\, d\\mu(x) \\\\ \\stackrel{(1)}{=} \\int 1_E (T(x)) \\, d\\mu(x) = \\int_X f \\circ T \\, d\\mu$$ so the assertion holds for all $f$ of the form $f=1_E$. By linearity, we conclude $$\\int_Y f \\, dT_{\\ast} \\mu = \\int_X f \\circ T \\, d\\mu \\tag{2}$$ for all $$f = \\sum_{j=1}^n c_j \\cdot 1_{E_j}$$ for some $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $c_j \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $E_j \\subseteq Y$ Borel. This means that the formula holds for all simple functions. Let $f \\in L^1(T_{\\ast} \\mu)$ such that $f \\geq 0$. Then there exists a sequence $(f_n)_n$ of simple functions such that $f = \\sup_n f_n$. Thus, we obtain by monotone convergence $$\\int f \\, dT_{\\ast} \\mu = \\sup_n \\int f_n \\, dT_{\\ast} \\mu = \\sup_n \\int f_n \\circ T \\, d\\mu = \\int f \\circ T \\, d\\mu$$ For arbritrary $f \\in L^1(T_{\\ast} \\mu)$, we write $f$ as a sum, $f = f^+ - f^-$ where $f^+, f^- \\geq 0$ and $f^-, f^+ \\in L^1(T_{\\ast} \\mu)$. By 3. the assertion holds for $f^-$ and $f^+$, so the assertion follows easily for $f$ using the linearity of the integral.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about proving an integral property involving the pushforward measure. The problem statement mentions that if we have a Borel measure μ on X and a Borel map T from X to Y, then the pushforward measure T*μ is defined by (T*μ)(E) = μ(T⁻¹(E)) for any Borel set E in Y. The task is to show that for a function f: Y → ℝ that is integrable with respect to T*μ, the integral of f over Y with respect to T*μ equals the integral of f composed with T over X with respect to μ.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a pushforward measure is. From the definition given, T*μ assigns to a Borel set E in Y the measure of its preimage under T in X. That makes sense. Now, the integral equality is reminiscent of the change of variables formula, where integrating a function composed with a transformation is equivalent to integrating the function against the pushforward of the original measure.\n\nThe user mentions that it's easy to prove T*μ is a measure on Y, which I agree with because the pushforward measure inherits the measure properties from μ, like countable additivity, since preimages preserve set operations.\n\nNow, for the integral equality. The standard approach to proving such equalities is to start with indicator functions and then extend to simple functions, measurable functions, and finally integrable functions using the monotone convergence theorem or dominated convergence theorem. Let me outline the steps.\n\n1. **Indicator Functions:** Let f be the indicator function of a Borel set E in Y. Then, ∫_Y f dT*μ = (T*μ)(E) = μ(T⁻¹(E)). On the other hand, ∫_X f∘T dμ = ∫_X χ_E(T(x)) dμ(x) = μ({x | T(x) ∈ E}) = μ(T⁻¹(E)). So, equality holds for indicators.\n\n2. **Simple Functions:** Extend to simple functions, which are finite linear combinations of indicator functions. By linearity of the integral, the equality should hold here too.\n\n3. **Non-negative Measurable Functions:** Use the fact that any non-negative measurable function can be approximated by an increasing sequence of simple functions. Apply the monotone convergence theorem to both sides to pass to the limit, maintaining equality.\n\n4. **Integrable Functions:** For integrable f (L¹), split into positive and negative parts and apply the previous step, using dominated convergence if necessary.\n\nI need to check if there are any hidden assumptions or conditions. The problem states that μ is a Borel measure, T is a Borel map, and f is in L¹(T*μ). The spaces X and Y are presumably topological spaces with their Borel σ-algebras. Since T is Borel measurable, T⁻¹(E) is a Borel set in X for any Borel E in Y, ensuring that T*μ is well-defined as a Borel measure on Y.\n\nOne thing to verify is whether the function f∘T is measurable with respect to μ. Since T is Borel measurable and f is Borel measurable (as it's integrable with respect to a Borel measure), their composition f∘T should be Borel measurable on X. Therefore, the integral ∫_X f∘T dμ is well-defined.\n\nAnother point is the integrability of f∘T. Since f is in L¹(T*μ), we have ∫_Y |f| dT*μ < ∞, which by the equality we're trying to prove, should equal ∫_X |f∘T| dμ. Hence, f∘T is in L¹(μ), ensuring the integral ∫_X f∘T dμ is finite.\n\nPutting this all together, the proof follows the standard machine of measure theory: start with indicators, move to simple functions, then non-negative, and finally integrable functions. Each step relies on the previous one and the convergence theorems. I think that's the approach here. I don't see any missing pieces, so this should work.",
