    "Content": "This is another exercise from Allan's book \"Introduction to Banach Spaces and Algebras\". Exercise 2.9: A Banach space $E$ is said to be homeomorphic to its square if $E\\oplus E$ is linearly homeomorphic to $E$.  Prove that the spaces $c$ and $C([0,1])$ have this property. Note that we haven't developed much theory yet (in this book!)  Well, $c_0 \\oplus c_0 \\cong c_0$ (split a sequence into the parts supported on the evens and odds say) and $c\\cong c_0$, so that does the case of $c$.  I cannot see an elementary proof for $C([0,1])$.  Here's a less than easy proof: clearly $C([0,1]) \\oplus_\\infty C([0,1]) = C([0,1] \\cup [2,3])$ say.  Then appeal to Miljutin's Theorem, as $[0,1] \\cup [2,3]$ is an uncountable compact metric space, $C([0,1] \\cup [2,3]) \\cong C([0,1])$. Surely I don't need the full power of Miljutin's Theorem.  But, for example, $C([0,1] \\cup [2,3])$ cannot be isometric to $C([0,1])$ (if we use real scalars) by the Banach-Stone theorem, as $[0,1] \\cup [2,3]$ is not homeomorphic to $[0,1]$. Surely using Miljutin's Theorem is not what the book intends. Is there an elementary proof that $C([0,1]) \\oplus C([0,1]) \\cong C([0,1])$?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "(Reposting my comment from above:) This result was known to Banach and a proof can be found in his book Theory of Linear Operations (note that this is the English translation of the French original); for details see Theorems 6 and 8 on p.111. To give a little more information here, Theorem 6 from Banach's book asserts that $C([0,1])$ is isomorphic to $C([0,1])\\oplus c_0$, whilst Theorem 8 from the same book shows similar to Alex Becker's comment above that $C([0,1])\\oplus C([0,1])$ is isomorphic to $C([0,1])\\oplus \\mathbb{R}$. One then deduces that $$C([0,1])\\oplus C([0,1]) \\approx C([0,1])\\oplus \\mathbb{R}\\approx (C([0,1])\\oplus c_0) \\oplus \\mathbb{R} $$ $$\\approx C([0,1])\\oplus (c_0 \\oplus \\mathbb{R}) \\approx C([0,1])\\oplus c_0 \\approx C([0,1]).$$ As Matt points out in the comments above, coming up with and executing this strategy seems a little heavy for an exercise!",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about proving that certain Banach spaces, specifically c and C([0,1]), are homeomorphic to their square. The user mentions that for the space c, they can use the fact that c0 ⊕ c0 ≅ c0 and c ≅ c0. But for C([0,1]), they are looking for an elementary proof instead of invoking Miljutin's Theorem.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that a Banach space E is homeomorphic to its square if E⊕E is linearly homeomorphic to E. The task is to prove this for c and C([0,1]). \n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed as single properties per line. So for this problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- E is a Banach space.\n- E is homeomorphic to its square (i.e., E⊕E is linearly homeomorphic to E).\n- The problem specifically considers the spaces c and C([0,1]).\n\nBut wait, the problem is to prove that c and C([0,1]) have this property. So the assumptions are that these spaces are Banach spaces and we need to show E⊕E ≅ E. However, the original problem statement doesn't list assumptions but rather the problem. The example given had assumptions like \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Here, maybe the assumptions are inherent properties of the spaces c and C([0,1]) that we need to use.\n\nWait, perhaps the user wants the assumptions from the problem statement. The problem says \"Prove that the spaces c and C([0,1]) have this property.\" The property is that E⊕E is linearly homeomorphic to E. So the main assumptions would be:\n\n- E is a Banach space.\n- For E = c, c is the space of convergent sequences.\n- For E = C([0,1]), it's the space of continuous functions on [0,1].\n- The problem requires showing E⊕E is linearly homeomorphic to E for these two cases.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were specific to the problem's conditions. So here, the problem is to prove the property for c and C([0,1]). The assumptions would be the given properties of these spaces. Let me parse again.\n\nOriginal problem statement:\n\n\"A Banach space E is said to be homeomorphic to its square if E⊕E is linearly homeomorphic to E. Prove that the spaces c and C([0,1]) have this property.\"\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- E is a Banach space.\n- For E = c, c is the space of convergent sequences.\n- For E = C([0,1]), it's the space of continuous functions on [0,1].\n- The problem requires proving that E⊕E is linearly homeomorphic to E for E = c and E = C([0,1]).\n\nBut according to the format, each assumption is a single property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nE is a Banach space,\nE is the space c of convergent sequences,\nE is the space C([0,1]) of continuous functions on [0,1],\nE⊕E is defined as the direct sum with the maximum norm (since the user mentions ⊕_∞ for C([0,1])).\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and n divisible by 7. So in this case, the problem is to prove for two specific spaces. Maybe the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nc is the Banach space of convergent sequences,\nC([0,1]) is the Banach space of continuous functions on [0,1],\nThe direct sum E⊕E is equipped with a norm making it a Banach space,\nLinear homeomorphism implies a continuous linear isomorphism with a continuous inverse.\n\nBut the problem doesn't state these; they are part of the general knowledge. The user is asking to structure the problem as per the example, which in the example extracted the specific assumptions given in the problem. The original problem statement here is to \"prove that the spaces c and C([0,1]) have this property,\" where the property is E⊕E being linearly homeomorphic to E.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be the definitions and given conditions:\n\nAssumption:\nE is a Banach space,\nE is homeomorphic to its square if E⊕E is linearly homeomorphic to E,\nThe problem considers the spaces c and C([0,1]).\n\nBut maybe the key is to list each assumption line by line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nE is a Banach space,\nE⊕E is linearly homeomorphic to E,\nE is the space c of convergent sequences,\nE is the space C([0,1]) of continuous functions on [0,1].\n\nBut perhaps more accurately, the problem is to prove for E = c and E = C([0,1]) that E⊕E is linearly homeomorphic to E. So the assumptions are that E is either c or C([0,1]), and these are Banach spaces. The problem is to show the homeomorphism.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. But in the problem here, the assumptions are not given as conditions but as the objects of study. Therefore, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nc is a Banach space of convergent sequences,\nC([0,1]) is a Banach space of continuous functions on [0,1],\nThe direct sum E⊕E is considered with a norm making it a Banach space,\nLinear homeomorphism (isomorphism) between Banach spaces is a bounded linear bijection with bounded inverse.\n\nBut the user's example extracted the problem's explicit conditions, not general knowledge. So perhaps the key assumptions here are:\n\n- The spaces c and C([0,1]) are Banach spaces.\n- The problem requires proving that for each of these spaces, E⊕E is linearly homeomorphic to E.\n\nBut how to list assumptions line by line? Each line addresses one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nFor the example given by the user, the original problem had a function A(n) defined for every integer n, but the formatted assumption listed n as integer and that n is divisible by 7. However, in the original problem statement, the user might have made a mistake. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, perhaps the user's example is flawed? Let me check.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption shouldn't include n divisible by 7 unless there's a typo. Maybe that was a mistake in the example. However, following the user's example, perhaps the formatted problem's assumptions include both the general conditions and specific ones. So in the current problem, maybe the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nc is a Banach space of convergent sequences,\nC([0,1]) is a Banach space of continuous functions on [0,1],\nThe direct sum E⊕E is considered with a norm making it a Banach space,\nThe problem requires proving E⊕E is linearly homeomorphic to E for E = c and E = C([0,1]).\n\nBut according to the user's instructions, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So breaking down:\n\nAssumption:\nE is a Banach space,\nE is the space c of convergent sequences,\nE is the space C([0,1]) of continuous functions on [0,1],\nThe direct sum E⊕E is a Banach space under the chosen norm,\nLinear homeomorphism implies a bounded linear isomorphism with bounded inverse.\n\nBut the problem as stated in the original question is to prove that c and C([0,1]) have the property that E⊕E is linearly homeomorphic to E. So the assumptions are the definitions of the spaces and the property to prove.\n\nWait, perhaps the user wants to list the problem's inherent assumptions. For example, that c and C([0,1]) are Banach spaces, which is a given. Then, the problem is to show they are homeomorphic to their square. So the structured problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nc is a Banach space of convergent sequences,\nC([0,1]) is a Banach space of continuous functions on [0,1],\nA Banach space E is homeomorphic to its square if E⊕E is linearly homeomorphic to E.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the spaces c and C([0,1]) are homeomorphic to their squares.\n\nBut the original problem says \"Prove that the spaces c and C([0,1]) have this property.\" So the problem is exactly that.\n\nTherefore, following the example, the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. The example extracted the variables' conditions. Here, the conditions are that E is c or C([0,1]), which are Banach spaces. So:\n\nAssumption:\nE is a Banach space,\nE is the space c of convergent sequences,\nE is the space C([0,1]) of continuous functions on [0,1],\nThe property in question is that E⊕E is linearly homeomorphic to E.\n\nProblem:\nProve that E has this property (E⊕E is linearly homeomorphic to E) for E = c and E = C([0,1]).\n\nBut in the example, assumptions were about the variables in the problem. Here, the variables are the spaces c and C([0,1]), so the assumptions are that they are Banach spaces. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nc is a Banach space,\nC([0,1]) is a Banach space,\nA Banach space E is homeomorphic to its square if E⊕E is linearly homeomorphic to E.\n\nProblem:\nProve that c and C([0,1]) are homeomorphic to their squares.\n\nBut maybe the problem statement in the example had an assumption that n is an integer, which was part of the original problem. So here, the original problem's assumptions are that c and C([0,1]) are Banach spaces, and the property is defined as E⊕E being linearly homeomorphic to E.\n\nBut since the problem is to prove the property for these spaces, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nc is a Banach space,\nC([0,1]) is a Banach space,\nHomeomorphic to square means E⊕E is linearly homeomorphic to E.\n\nProblem:\nProve that c and C([0,1]) are homeomorphic to their squares.\n\nThat seems to fit the format. Each assumption is one property applied to one object. So each line lists a separate assumption.",
