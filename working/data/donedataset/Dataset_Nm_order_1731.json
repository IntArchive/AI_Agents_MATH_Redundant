    "Content": "In proof of $\\displaystyle\\lim_{x\\rightarrow0}\\frac{\\sin{x}}{x}=1$ is assumed that $\\sin{x}\\leq{x}\\leq\\tan{x}$ while $0<x<\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. First comparison is clear, arc length must be greater than sine value, but how about $x\\leq\\tan{x}$, why tangent is longer than arc?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "It's fine if the comparisons of those lengths is intuitively clear to you, but if you want to be rigorous, it's easier to compare nested areas than it is to compare curve lengths. Working off of David Mitra's picture (see his answer), the area of the triangle spanned by the lines $\\cos(t)$ and $\\sin(t)$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cos(t)\\sin(t)$. That area rests inside the sector of angle $t$, which has area $\\frac{t}{2}$ (the proportion $\\frac{t}{2\\pi}$ of the entire circle's area $\\pi$). And in turn, the area of sector is inside the triangle spanned by the horizontal radius of the unit circle and $\\tan(t)$, which has area $\\frac{1}{2} \\tan(t)$. Thus we have the inequality $$\\frac{1}{2} \\cos(t)\\sin(t) \\le \\frac{t}{2} \\le \\frac{1}{2} \\tan(t)$$ Or $$\\cos(t)\\sin(t) \\le t \\le \\tan(t)$$ canceling the 2's. You should be able to adjust your proof of $\\displaystyle\\lim_{t \\to 0} \\frac{\\sin(t)}{t} = 1$ to utilize this slightly weaker inequality.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about why x is less than tan x when 0 < x < π/2. The user mentions that in the proof of the limit of sin(x)/x as x approaches 0, it's assumed that sin x ≤ x ≤ tan x in that interval. They understand the first part (sin x ≤ x) because the arc length is greater than the sine value, but are confused about why x ≤ tan x.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The problem is in the context of 0 < x < π/2. So the assumptions would include that x is a real number in that interval. The problem is asking why x is less than tan x in this interval. \n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the key conditions are the interval for x. So the assumption should be that x is between 0 and π/2, not including the endpoints. The problem is to show that x < tan x in that interval. \n\nWait, the original question uses x ≤ tan x, but the title says why x < tan x. There's a slight discrepancy here. The user's title uses a strict inequality, but in their question, they write x ≤ tan x. However, in the standard proof, it's actually x < tan x for 0 < x < π/2. Because at x=0, tan x = 0, but the interval is open, so x is strictly between 0 and π/2. So the correct inequality here is strict. So the problem should state to prove that x < tan x in that interval. \n\nTherefore, the assumption is that x is a real number in the open interval (0, π/2). The problem is to prove that x < tan x under this assumption. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other hidden assumptions. The user refers to the comparison in the proof of lim sin(x)/x = 1. The key here is to structure the problem as per the format, listing each assumption line by line, each applying to one object. Here, the only assumption is about the domain of x. So the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number,\n0 < x < π/2.\n\nProblem:\nProve that x < tan x.\n\nI think that's it. The original question might not mention that x is real, but in the context of calculus and trigonometric functions, x is typically a real number. So including that as an assumption makes sense. Also, each condition is separate: first, x is real; second, x is in the interval (0, π/2). Then the problem is to show the inequality.",
