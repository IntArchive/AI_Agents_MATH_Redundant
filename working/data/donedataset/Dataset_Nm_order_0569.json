    "Content": "A function $f:\\Bbb R \\to \\Bbb R$ is additive and Lebesgue measurable. Prove that $f$ is continuous. I know that on $\\Bbb Q$, $f$ comes out to be linear. So, if $f$ is to be continuous then $f$ must be linear in $\\Bbb R$. But, I'm stuck here. If anyone can please help. Thanks in advance.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Using Lusin's theorem , there exists a compact $K \\subset [0,1]$ such that $\\mu(K)>2/3$ and $f$ continuous on $K$. Let $\\epsilon>0$. In fact, $f$ is uniformly continuous on $K$, so there exists $\\delta>0$ such that $|x-y|<\\delta$ implies $|f(x)-f(y)|<\\epsilon$; without loss of generality, suppose $\\delta<1/3$. Let $h<\\delta$. Notice that the intersection between $K$ and $K-h$ is nonempty; otherwise, $1+h= \\mu([-h,1]) \\geq \\mu(K \\cup K-h)= \\mu(K)+\\mu(K-h)=2\\mu(K)>4/3$, so $h>1/3$ whereas $h<\\delta<1/3$ by assumption. Let $x_0 \\in K \\cap (K-h)$. We have $|f(x_0+h)-f(x_0)|<\\epsilon$, hence $|f(h)|<\\epsilon$ because $f$ is additive. You deduce that $f$ is continuous at $0$. Finally, it is straightforward to conclude that $f$ is continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$. Edit: For a simple proof of Lusin's theorem, see for example: Marcus B. Feldman, A proof of Lusin's theorem , The American Mathematical Monthly Vol. 88, No. 3 (Mar., 1981) (pp. 191-192).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. First, I need to identify all the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe original question is about proving that an additive and Lebesgue measurable function from R to R is continuous. Let me parse through the question carefully.\n\nThe title says \"Additivity + Measurability $\\implies$ Continuity\". The question body states: A function $f:\\Bbb R \\to \\Bbb R$ is additive and Lebesgue measurable. Prove that $f$ is continuous. The user also mentions that on $\\Bbb Q$, $f$ is linear, and they're stuck on connecting this to continuity over $\\Bbb R$.\n\nSo, the key elements here are:\n\n1. The function $f$ is additive. By definition, additive means $f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y)$ for all real numbers x and y.\n2. The function $f$ is Lebesgue measurable.\n3. The problem is to prove that $f$ is continuous on $\\Bbb R$.\n\nNow, the example provided in the initial instruction had assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. In the example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions would be about the function f: it's additive and Lebesgue measurable. Each of these is a separate property of the same object (the function f), so each should be a separate line in the assumptions.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not including extra information beyond the problem's assumptions. The user's own thoughts about f being linear on Q and getting stuck are part of the original question's context but aren't part of the problem's assumptions. So those should be excluded from the formatted problem.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n- $f$ is a function from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$,\n- $f$ is additive (i.e., $f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y)$ for all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$),\n- $f$ is Lebesgue measurable.\n\nThe problem is to prove that $f$ is continuous.\n\nI should structure it as per the format, with each assumption on a separate line. Let me check the example again. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Similarly here, each property of f is a separate assumption line.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have three assumptions: the function's domain and codomain, additivity, and measurability. Then the problem is to prove continuity.\n\nWait, in the example, the first assumption was \"n is an integer\", the second \"n is divisible by 7\". So each line is a separate condition on the same object. Here, the first line could be \"f is a function from R to R\", then \"f is additive\", then \"f is Lebesgue measurable\". Each of these is a separate condition applied to the function f.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the user wants each assumption to be a single line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. In this case, all three lines are about f. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n$f$ is a function from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$,\n$f$ is additive,\n$f$ is Lebesgue measurable.\nProblem:\nProve that $f$ is continuous.\n\nI need to ensure there are no extra assumptions or missing ones. The original problem states that f is additive and Lebesgue measurable. The fact that f is a function from R to R is inherent in the problem statement. So all three points are necessary and sufficient.",
