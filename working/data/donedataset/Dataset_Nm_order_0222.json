    "Content": "Wikipedia claims this but only cites an offline proof: $$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} 2^n \\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{2+\\cdots+ \\sqrt 2}} = \\pi$$ for $n$ square roots and one minus sign. The formula is not the \"usual\" one, like Taylor series or something like that, so I can't easily prove it. I wrote a little script to calculate it and it's clearly visible, but that's not a proof.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "It's the sequence of approximations obtained when you approximate the perimeter of the  circle of diameter $1$ with inscribed regular $n$ -gons for $n$ a power of $2$ . As I happen to have this TeXed' up, I'll offer: Suppose regular $2^n$ -gons are inscribed in a circle of radius $r$ . Suppose the side length(the length of one \"face\") $a_n$ of a the inscribed $2^{n}$ -gon is known (so, $a_2$ is the side length of the square).\nTo find the side length of the $2^{n+1}$ -gon, one may  apply the Pythagorean Theorem twice to obtain $$\n\\tag{1}a_{n+1} = r\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{4-{a_n^2\\over r^2}}} \n$$ Now, starting with a square, $$a_2=\\sqrt 2 r.$$ Using the recursion formula (1) repeatedly gives: $$\na_3%= r\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{4-{2r^2\\over r^2}}} \n=  r\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt2}, \n$$ $$\na_4%= r\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{4-{ ( r\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt2})^2       \\over r^2}}}  = r\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{4-{ ({2-\\sqrt2} )    }}} \n= r\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{{ {2+\\sqrt2}     }}},\n$$ and $$\na_5%=  r\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{4-{     (      r\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{{ {2+\\sqrt2}     }}}            )^2\\over r^2}}}   \n= \n r\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{ 2+\\sqrt{{ {2+\\sqrt2}     }}}            }. \n$$ $$\\vdots$$ Let $b_n=2^n a_n$ . Let $P_n=r\\cdot b_n$ be the perimeter of the $2^n$ -gon.  Let $P$ be the perimeter of the circle.\nThen $$\n \\lim_{ n\\rightarrow \\infty} P_n = P.\n$$ Note that from the above identity,  it follows that the ratio of the perimeter of a circle to its diameter must be a constant, namely $\\lim\\limits_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} b_n$ . We call this number $\\pi$ . Below are some particular calculations when the radius of the circle is $1/2$ : $$\\eqalign{\n P_2&=2^1\\cdot\\sqrt 2 \\approx 2.82842712\\cr \n P_3&=2^2\\cdot\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt2}\\approx 3.06146746\\cr\n P_4&=2^3\\cdot\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt2}}\\approx3.12144515 \\cr\n P_5&=2^4\\cdot\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt2}}}\\approx 3.13654849\\cr\n P_6&=2^5\\cdot\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt2}}}}\\approx 3.14033116\\cr\n P_7&=2^6\\cdot\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt2}}}}}\\approx 3.14127725\\cr\n P_8&=2^7\\cdot\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt2}}}}}}\\approx 3.1415138 \\cr\n P_9&=2^8\\cdot\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt2}}}}}}}\\approx  3.14157294 \\cr\n}\n$$ For completedness: Remark 1: Here is the proof that the recursion formula (1) holds: Let $a_n$ be the side length of the $2^n$ -gon. To obtain the $2^{n+1}$ -gon: take the \"outer end point\" of the radii of the circle that  bisect the faces of the $2^n$ -gon to form the new vertices of the $2^{n+1}$ -gon. We  then have, for $a_{n+1}$ , the scenario shown in the following diagram (not to scale): Now $$\nb^2=r^2-{a_n^2\\over4};\n$$ whence $$\\eqalign{\na_{n+1}^2={a_n^2\\over4} + \\Biggl((r-\\sqrt{ r^2-{a_n^2\\over4}}\\ \\Biggr)^2\n&={a_n^2\\over4}+  r^2-2r\\sqrt{r^2-{a_n^2\\over4}}+r^2 -{a_n^2\\over4}\\cr\n&= 2r^2-2r\\sqrt{r^2-{a_n^2\\over4}}\\cr\n&= 2r^2-r^2\\sqrt{4-{a_n^2\\over r^2}}\\cr\n&= r^2 \\Biggl(2-\\sqrt{4-{a_n^2\\over r^2}}\\ \\Biggr).}$$ And, thus $$\na_{n+1}= r \\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{4-{a_n^2\\over r^2}}}.\n$$ Remark 2: To explain why limit $\\lim\\limits_{n\\rightarrow\\infty} P_n=P\\ $ holds, I can do no better than refer you to Eric Naslund's comment in his answer.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me start by reading the original question carefully. The user is asking about a limit involving nested square roots of twos that supposedly equals pi. The formula given is the limit as n approaches infinity of 2^n multiplied by the square root of (2 minus a nested square root expression with n square roots and one minus sign). \n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions. The problem mentions a limit as n goes to infinity, and the expression inside the limit is 2^n times a nested square root. The nested part is sqrt(2 - sqrt(2 + ... + sqrt(2))) with n square roots and one minus sign. The user also mentions that the formula isn't the usual Taylor series type, so they can't easily prove it. \n\nBreaking down the assumptions: The main object here is the sequence defined by the nested square roots. The expression has n square roots, and there's a structure of alternating signs? Wait, the original problem says \"one minus sign.\" So maybe the structure is a single minus at the beginning and the rest are additions? Let me check the formula again. The formula is sqrt(2 - sqrt(2 + sqrt(2 + ... + sqrt(2))). So the first operation is a minus, followed by additions. So for n square roots, there's one minus and (n-1) pluses. But the problem statement says \"n square roots and one minus sign.\" So each term in the sequence for a given n is built with n square roots, and only one minus sign in the entire expression. So the expression is sqrt(2 - sqrt(2 + sqrt(2 + ... + sqrt(2)))) with n square roots. \n\nSo the assumptions would be about the structure of the expression. Each term in the sequence involves n square roots, the first operation is a subtraction, followed by additions. The limit is taken as n approaches infinity. The coefficient outside the square root is 2^n. The problem is to prove that this limit equals pi.\n\nSo, for the assumptions, each should be a single condition applied to one object. Let me list them:\n\n1. The sequence is defined as $a_n = 2^n \\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2 + \\cdots + \\sqrt{2}}}$, where the nested square root contains n square roots.\n2. The nested square root expression in $a_n$ has exactly one minus sign (the first operation) and (n-1) plus signs.\n3. The limit is taken as $n$ approaches infinity.\n\nWait, but the problem is to show that this limit equals pi. So the problem statement is to prove that $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} a_n = \\pi$.\n\nBut in the example provided, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was not in the original problem. Wait, in the example, the user structured the problem by adding an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem, the user said \"for every integer n\". So maybe in that example, the user made a mistake? Wait, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, but the example was provided by the user as an example of how to structure. Hmm. So perhaps in the example, they filtered out some information. Maybe the original problem had a hidden assumption? Or maybe the user made a mistake in the example. But regardless, for the current problem, I need to extract assumptions from the question as presented.\n\nThe current problem is from the user's Math Stack Exchange question. The user wrote that the formula is $$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} 2^n \\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{2+\\cdots+ \\sqrt 2}} = \\pi$$ for $n$ square roots and one minus sign. So the assumptions here are:\n\n- The expression inside the limit has n square roots.\n- The expression inside the square root starts with a minus sign followed by additions.\n- The limit is taken as n approaches infinity.\n\nTherefore, structuring the assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\nThe sequence is defined by $a_n = 2^n \\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2 + \\cdots + \\sqrt{2}}}$ with n square roots,\nThe nested expression in $a_n$ contains one minus sign and (n-1) plus signs,\nThe limit is considered as $n$ approaches infinity.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} 2^n \\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{2+\\cdots+ \\sqrt 2}} = \\pi$$ where the nested square root contains n terms with one minus sign.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So breaking down the assumptions line by line:\n\n1. The sequence is defined as $a_n = 2^n \\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2 + \\cdots + \\sqrt{2}}}}$, where the nested square root contains n square roots.\n2. The nested square root expression in $a_n$ contains exactly one minus sign.\n3. The limit is considered as $n$ approaches infinity.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The first defines the sequence structure, the second specifies the number of minus signs, the third is about the limit.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nThe sequence is defined as $a_n = 2^n \\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2 + \\cdots + \\sqrt{2}}}}$ with $n$ square roots,\nThe nested square root expression in $a_n$ contains exactly one minus sign,\nThe limit is considered as $n$ approaches infinity.\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} 2^n \\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{2+\\cdots+ \\sqrt 2}} = \\pi$$\n###",
