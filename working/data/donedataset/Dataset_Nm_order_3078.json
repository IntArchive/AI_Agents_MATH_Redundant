    "Content": "Show that there is no rational number $x$ satisfying the equation $x^2-[x]=4$ . Find the roots of the equation $x^2-[x]=4$ where $[x]$ is the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$ . I tried to solve this equation but stuck. For the first part i supposed $x=\\frac{p}{q}$ be the solution of the equation. $$\\frac{p^2}{q^2}-4=\\left[\\frac{p}{q}\\right]$$ Now LHS is rational and RHS is an integer. Therefore our assumption is wrong. There is contradiction. So its roots are not rational. $x^2-4=[x]\\implies (x-2)(x+2)=[x]$ How should i move ahead? Please guide me. Its roots are $-\\sqrt2,\\sqrt6$ . Is my method of solving the first part correct?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Write $x = [x] + \\varepsilon$ . Then you are trying to solve $$n^2 + 2\\varepsilon n + \\varepsilon^2 - n - 4= 0 $$ For an integer value of $n$ and some $\\varepsilon \\in [0,1)$ .  By the quadratic formula we can express $\\varepsilon$ in terms of $n$ , $$\\varepsilon^2 + (2n)\\varepsilon +[n^2  - n - 4]= 0 $$ $$\\varepsilon = \\frac{-2n ± \\sqrt{4n^2 - 4(n^2 - n - 4)}}{2} = -n ± \\sqrt{n+4}$$ So now we want to find values of $n$ where $$ -n + \\sqrt{n+4} \\in [0,1)$$ or $$-n -\\sqrt{n+4} \\in [0,1)$$ Lets try the first case, i.e. find $n$ such that $-n + \\sqrt{n+4} \\in [0,1) $ .\nBoth conditions below must hold for a solution: $$ -n + \\sqrt{n+4} \\geq 0 \\quad\\text{ and } -n + \\sqrt{n+4} < 1\\quad$$ We try small values of $n\\geq -4$ , $$\\begin{array}{c|cccc}\nn & -4 & -3 & -2 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3\\\\ \\hline\n-n+\\sqrt{n+4} & 4 & 4 & 2+\\sqrt{2} & 1+\\sqrt{3} & 2 & -1+\\sqrt{5} & \\color{red}{-2+\\sqrt{6}} & -3+\\sqrt{7}\n\\end{array}$$ There is no need to check $n<-4$ since $\\sqrt{n+4}$ won't be defined, and no need to check $n>3$ since the gap only widens. ( $-n + \\sqrt{n+4}$ is decreasing for $n>3$ ). so $n=2$ is the only solution for the first case, with $\\varepsilon=-2+\\sqrt{6}$ and $x=\\sqrt{6}$ . Similarly for the second case, we need $$ -n - \\sqrt{n+4} \\geq 0 \\quad\\text{ and } -n - \\sqrt{n+4} < 1\\quad$$ $$\\begin{array}{c|cccccc}\nn & -4 & -3 & -2 & -1 & 0 \\\\ \\hline\n-n-\\sqrt{n+4} & 4 & 2 & \\color{red}{2-\\sqrt{2}} & 1-\\sqrt{3}& -2 \\\\\n\\end{array}$$ There is no need to check $n\\le-4$ or $n>0$ , for similar reasons to the first case. Hence, the only two solutions to the whole problem are $$ x=-\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{6}.$$ Regarding the rest of the question as in your edit: Your proof is incomplete. An integer is also rational! If $p/q$ is a solution, then we do indeed get $\\frac{p^2}{q^2} - 4 = \\left[\\frac{p}{q}\\right]$ , but this itself is not a contradiction. It only means that $q^2=1$ . Thus the equation reduces to $$p^2 - p - 4 = 0, \\quad p\\in\\Bbb Z$$ But of course the only real solutions to this are $\\frac{1± \\sqrt{1+16}}{2}$ which are not integers.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user has two parts to their question: first, to show there's no rational solution to the equation \\( x^2 - [x] = 4 \\), and second, to find the actual roots, which they claim are \\( -\\sqrt{2} \\) and \\( \\sqrt{6} \\). They also mentioned their method for the first part and are asking if it's correct. Let me parse through this carefully.\n\nStarting with the first part: proving no rational solution exists. The user assumed \\( x = \\frac{p}{q} \\) is a rational solution, leading to \\( \\frac{p^2}{q^2} - 4 = \\left[ \\frac{p}{q} \\right] \\). They note that the left-hand side (LHS) is rational, while the right-hand side (RHS) is an integer. Since integers are rational, maybe the contradiction isn't straightforward. Wait, the problem here is that the LHS is \\( \\frac{p^2}{q^2} - 4 \\), which is a rational number minus 4, so still rational. The RHS, the floor function of a rational number, is indeed an integer. So if \\( x \\) is rational, then \\( [x] \\) is integer. Therefore, the equation implies that \\( x^2 - 4 \\) must be an integer. But even if \\( x \\) is rational, \\( x^2 \\) might not be an integer. Let me think.\n\nSuppose \\( x \\) is rational, say \\( x = a + \\frac{b}{c} \\) where \\( a \\) is integer and \\( 0 \\leq \\frac{b}{c} < 1 \\). Then \\( [x] = a \\). The equation becomes \\( x^2 - a = 4 \\). So \\( x^2 = a + 4 \\). Since \\( x \\) is rational, \\( x^2 \\) is rational, so \\( a + 4 \\) is rational, which it is because \\( a \\) is integer. But for \\( x^2 \\) to be equal to an integer plus 4, which is an integer, \\( x^2 \\) must be an integer. Therefore, if \\( x \\) is rational and \\( x^2 \\) is an integer, then \\( x \\) must be an integer itself, because the square root of an integer is either integer or irrational. So if \\( x \\) is a rational number and \\( x^2 \\) is integer, then \\( x \\) has to be integer. Therefore, the assumption that \\( x \\) is rational leads to \\( x \\) being integer. So let's check if any integer satisfies the equation.\n\nIf \\( x \\) is integer, then \\( [x] = x \\), so the equation becomes \\( x^2 - x = 4 \\), which simplifies to \\( x^2 - x - 4 = 0 \\). Solving this quadratic: discriminant \\( D = 1 + 16 = 17 \\), roots \\( \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{17}}{2} \\). These are not integers, so there are no integer solutions. Hence, no rational solutions. Therefore, the user's initial approach is correct but perhaps missing some steps. They concluded that since LHS is rational and RHS is integer, the assumption is wrong. But actually, the key point is that if \\( x \\) is rational, then \\( x^2 - 4 \\) must be integer, which forces \\( x \\) to be integer, leading to a contradiction because the quadratic has no integer roots. So maybe the user's reasoning is a bit abbreviated but correct in essence.\n\nNow, moving to the second part: finding the roots of \\( x^2 - [x] = 4 \\). The user says the roots are \\( -\\sqrt{2} \\) and \\( \\sqrt{6} \\). Let's verify that.\n\nFirst, let's denote \\( [x] \\) as the floor function of \\( x \\), written as \\( \\lfloor x \\rfloor \\). So the equation is \\( x^2 - \\lfloor x \\rfloor = 4 \\).\n\nTo solve this, we can consider different intervals based on the integer parts. Let \\( n = \\lfloor x \\rfloor \\), which is an integer. Then, \\( n \\leq x < n + 1 \\), and the equation becomes \\( x^2 - n = 4 \\Rightarrow x^2 = n + 4 \\). Therefore, \\( x = \\pm \\sqrt{n + 4} \\). But \\( x \\) must lie in the interval \\( [n, n + 1) \\). Therefore, for each integer \\( n \\), we can check if \\( \\sqrt{n + 4} \\) or \\( -\\sqrt{n + 4} \\) lies in \\( [n, n + 1) \\).\n\nLet's analyze possible values of \\( n \\).\n\nCase 1: \\( x \\geq 0 \\). Then \\( n \\geq 0 \\), and \\( x = \\sqrt{n + 4} \\). We need \\( n \\leq \\sqrt{n + 4} < n + 1 \\).\n\nSimilarly, for negative \\( x \\), \\( n \\leq x < n + 1 \\), but \\( n \\) is less than or equal to \\( x \\), which is negative. So \\( n \\) must be less than or equal to \\( x \\), which is negative, so \\( n \\leq -1 \\). Then \\( x = -\\sqrt{n + 4} \\), and we need \\( n \\leq -\\sqrt{n + 4} < n + 1 \\).\n\nLet's start with positive \\( x \\).\n\nFor \\( x \\geq 0 \\): \\( n \\geq 0 \\), \\( x = \\sqrt{n + 4} \\), and \\( n \\leq \\sqrt{n + 4} < n + 1 \\).\n\nLet's square the inequalities:\n\nLeft inequality: \\( n \\leq \\sqrt{n + 4} \\Rightarrow n^2 \\leq n + 4 \\Rightarrow n^2 - n - 4 \\leq 0 \\). The quadratic equation \\( n^2 - n - 4 = 0 \\) has roots \\( \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{17}}{2} \\approx \\frac{1 \\pm 4.123}{2} \\), so approximately \\( 2.561 \\) and \\( -1.561 \\). Since \\( n \\) is a non-negative integer, the inequality \\( n^2 - n - 4 \\leq 0 \\) holds for integers \\( n \\leq 2 \\). So n can be 0, 1, 2.\n\nRight inequality: \\( \\sqrt{n + 4} < n + 1 \\Rightarrow n + 4 < (n + 1)^2 \\Rightarrow n + 4 < n^2 + 2n + 1 \\Rightarrow 0 < n^2 + n - 3 \\). Solve \\( n^2 + n - 3 > 0 \\). The roots are \\( \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 12}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{13}}{2} \\approx \\frac{-1 \\pm 3.606}{2} \\). Positive root is approx \\( 1.303 \\). So for integers \\( n \\geq 2 \\), this inequality holds. Therefore, combining left and right inequalities, for n=2: check if \\( n=2 \\).\n\nCheck n=0: x = sqrt(0 +4)=2. Check if 0 ≤ 2 <1? No, 2 is not less than 1. So invalid.\n\nn=1: x=sqrt(1+4)=sqrt(5)≈2.236. Check if 1 ≤ sqrt(5) <2? But sqrt(5)≈2.236 >=2, so 2.236 <2 is false. So invalid.\n\nn=2: x=sqrt(2+4)=sqrt(6)≈2.449. Check if 2 ≤ sqrt(6) <3? Yes, because 2.449 is between 2 and 3. So this is valid. So x=sqrt(6) is a solution.\n\nNow negative x:\n\nFor x <0: n ≤ x <n+1, where n is integer ≤-1. Then x=-sqrt(n +4). Since x is negative, sqrt(n +4) must be positive, so n +4 ≥0 => n ≥ -4. Since n ≤ -1, possible n: -4, -3, -2, -1.\n\nSo check each n:\n\nn=-4: x=-sqrt(-4 +4)= -sqrt(0)=0. But x=0 is not in [n, n+1)=[-4,-3). So invalid.\n\nn=-3: x=-sqrt(-3 +4)= -sqrt(1)= -1. Check if -3 ≤ -1 < -2? No, because -1 is not less than -2. Invalid.\n\nn=-2: x=-sqrt(-2 +4)= -sqrt(2)≈-1.414. Check if -2 ≤ -1.414 < -1? Yes, because -1.414 is between -2 and -1. So valid.\n\nn=-1: x=-sqrt(-1 +4)= -sqrt(3)≈-1.732. Check if -1 ≤ -1.732 <0? No, since -1.732 < -1. So invalid.\n\nTherefore, the only solutions are x= sqrt(6) (approx 2.449) and x=-sqrt(2) (approx -1.414). So the user's answer is correct.\n\nThe user asked if their method for the first part is correct. Their reasoning was that LHS is rational, RHS is integer, so contradiction. But actually, since integers are rational, the contradiction isn't direct. However, when they assume x is rational, then [x] is integer, so x² - [x] =4 implies x² = [x] +4. Since [x] is integer, x² must be integer +4, hence integer. Therefore, x² is integer, so x is either integer or irrational. If x is rational, x must be integer, but as shown, no integer satisfies x² -x =4. Therefore, no rational solutions. So the user's initial approach is correct but needs more detailed steps to explain why the RHS being integer leads to contradiction. They might have abbreviated it, but the core idea is there.\n\nSo putting this all together, structuring the problem as per the required format.",
