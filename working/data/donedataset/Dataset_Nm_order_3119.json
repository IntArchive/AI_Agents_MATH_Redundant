If you want one of this kind, well, there's one (I spent so much time in looking for this!): Natanson, Theory of Functions of a Real Variable , volume 1, Chapter IX, section 7, theorem 1.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, the task is to show that if a function F(x) is continuous on [a, b], has a derivative everywhere in (a, b), and that derivative F’(x) is integrable, then F is absolutely continuous on [a, b]. The user mentioned a hint about showing that if F’(x) ≥ 0 almost everywhere, then F is increasing, and they want to see how that hint can be used here.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the definitions. Absolute continuity of a function F on [a, b] means that for every ε > 0, there exists a δ > 0 such that for any finite collection of disjoint intervals (a₁, b₁), ..., (aₙ, bₙ) in [a, b], if the sum of their lengths is less than δ, then the sum of |F(bᵢ) - F(aᵢ)| is less than ε. So, it's a stronger form of continuity that controls the variation over small total interval lengths.\n\nGiven that F is continuous and differentiable everywhere on (a, b) with integrable derivative, I remember the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC). If F’ is integrable, then under certain conditions, F can be expressed as the integral of its derivative plus a constant. But for the FTC part II, we usually require F to be absolutely continuous to conclude that F(x) = F(a) + ∫ₐˣ F’(t) dt. Wait, but here the problem is the reverse: given that F’ exists everywhere and is integrable, show F is absolutely continuous. So maybe the approach is to show that F can be written as the integral of its derivative, which would imply absolute continuity.\n\nBut how does the hint about F’(x) ≥ 0 a.e. implying F is increasing come into play? Maybe the idea is to decompose F’ into positive and negative parts, use some kind of Jordan decomposition? Let's think. If F’ is integrable, then F’ can be written as the difference of two non-negative integrable functions: F’ = F’⁺ - F’⁻. If we can integrate these parts separately and show that integrating F’⁺ gives an increasing function and integrating F’⁻ gives a decreasing function, then their difference would be F(x) - F(a), assuming F is the integral of F’. But I'm not sure how the hint directly applies here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the hint is suggesting to use the fact that if F’ is integrable, then F is the integral of F’ plus a constant, which would make F absolutely continuous. But the standard FTC requires F to be absolutely continuous to recover F from its derivative. However, here we have F differentiable everywhere with integrable derivative. I think there's a theorem that says if F is differentiable everywhere on [a, b] (or a.e.) and F’ is integrable, then F is absolutely continuous. But isn't that exactly the problem statement? So maybe the problem is to prove this theorem using the given hint.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's book is approaching this via the hint that if F’ ≥0 a.e., then F is increasing, and perhaps decomposing F into functions with non-negative derivatives? Hmm.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe consider the positive and negative variations of F. If F’ is integrable, then the integral of F’ from a to x exists, and perhaps F(x) - F(a) equals that integral. If that's the case, then F is absolutely continuous because the integral of an L¹ function is absolutely continuous. But how do we show that F(x) - F(a) equals the integral of F’ without assuming F is absolutely continuous?\n\nI recall that if F is differentiable everywhere with F’ in L¹, then F is absolutely continuous. This is known as the Banach-Zaretsky theorem, but I might be mixing up theorems. Alternatively, maybe it's a consequence of the Vitali covering theorem or the Henstock-Kurzweil integral. Wait, no. Let me check.\n\nWait, the standard result is that if F is differentiable everywhere on [a, b], F’ is integrable, and F is the integral of F’, then F is absolutely continuous. But the problem here is that we need to show F is absolutely continuous given that it's continuous, differentiable everywhere with integrable derivative. So perhaps the key step is to show that F is equal to the integral of its derivative. If that's true, then since the integral of an L¹ function is absolutely continuous, F would be absolutely continuous.\n\nBut how to show F(x) - F(a) = ∫ₐˣ F’(t) dt under these conditions? The usual FTC part II requires F to be absolutely continuous. However, there's a theorem called the Henstock-Kurzweil FTC which might relax these conditions, but maybe that's overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the fact that F’ is integrable and F is continuous, then F is absolutely continuous. To prove this, perhaps we can use the hint by considering that if F’ is non-negative a.e., then F is increasing, which would be a special case, and then generalize.\n\nSo let's try to use the hint. Suppose we can show that if F’ ≥ 0 a.e., then F is increasing. Then, if we can decompose F into two functions, each of which has derivative non-negative a.e., then maybe we can show that F is a difference of two increasing functions, hence of bounded variation, and since it's also continuous, maybe that would lead to absolute continuity? Wait, but being of bounded variation and continuous doesn't necessarily imply absolute continuity. However, if the function is the integral of its derivative, that would do it.\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible path: Let’s assume that F’ is integrable. Let’s define G(x) = ∫ₐˣ F’(t) dt. Then G is absolutely continuous. If we can show that F(x) - G(x) is constant, then since G is absolutely continuous, F would be too. How to show that? Since F is differentiable everywhere and G is differentiable a.e. with G’ = F’ a.e., then (F - G)’ = 0 a.e. If F - G is continuous and has derivative zero a.e., then under what conditions is it constant? If F - G is absolutely continuous, then yes. But we don't know that yet. Alternatively, if F - G is Lipschitz, or if we can apply the mean value theorem.\n\nWait, but F is continuous on [a, b], differentiable everywhere in (a, b), and G is absolutely continuous, hence also continuous. Therefore, F - G is continuous. If (F - G)’(x) = 0 for almost every x in (a, b), then by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for Lebesgue integrals, if F - G is absolutely continuous, then it's constant. But we need to show F - G is absolutely continuous. But we don't know that yet. However, since G is absolutely continuous, if F is continuous and F - G has derivative zero a.e., perhaps we can use the fact that a continuous function with derivative zero everywhere (or a.e. under some conditions) is constant. \n\nWait, there's a theorem that says if a function is continuous on [a, b], differentiable everywhere on (a, b) except possibly a countable set, and the derivative is zero wherever it exists, then the function is constant. But here, (F - G)’(x) = 0 for almost every x, which is a much larger set than countable. However, even if the derivative is zero a.e., it's not sufficient to conclude the function is constant without additional conditions. For example, the Cantor function has derivative zero a.e. but isn't constant. However, the Cantor function is not absolutely continuous. So maybe if we can use the fact that F - G is continuous and has derivative zero a.e., and since F - G is equal to the difference between F and an absolutely continuous function G, but how to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the hint: Suppose F’ ≥0 a.e., then F is increasing. Then, if we can decompose F into the difference of two functions, each of which has derivative non-negative a.e., then each of those would be increasing, so F would be the difference of two increasing functions, hence of bounded variation. Since F is continuous and of bounded variation, it's differentiable a.e., but we already have differentiable everywhere. But bounded variation and continuous does not imply absolute continuity unless the function is also absolutely continuous. Wait, no. Bounded variation implies the function can be decomposed into increasing functions, hence into differences of two monotonous functions, but absolute continuity is a stronger property.\n\nAlternatively, if F’ is integrable, then the integral of |F’| is finite. If we can use that to show that the total variation of F is equal to the integral of |F’|, which would imply that F is absolutely continuous. But how to connect that.\n\nWait, here's a different approach inspired by the hint. Suppose we can show that F is absolutely continuous by verifying that it satisfies the definition. Given that F’ is integrable, then for any ε > 0, we need to find δ > 0 such that for any collection of intervals, the sum of their lengths < δ implies sum |F(bᵢ) - F(aᵢ)| < ε. \n\nUsing the Mean Value Theorem, for each interval [aᵢ, bᵢ], there exists cᵢ in (aᵢ, bᵢ) such that F(bᵢ) - F(aᵢ) = F’(cᵢ)(bᵢ - aᵢ). Then sum |F(bᵢ) - F(aᵢ)| = sum |F’(cᵢ)|(bᵢ - aᵢ). If the points cᵢ were disjoint and we could relate this sum to the integral of |F’|, but since the intervals are disjoint, the cᵢ can be chosen within each interval, so the sum is like a Riemann sum for the integral. However, F’ is only known to be integrable, not necessarily Riemann integrable. But in the Lebesgue sense, the integral of |F’| over a set can be made small if the measure of the set is small. So, given that F’ is integrable, for ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for any measurable set A with measure less than δ, ∫_A |F’| < ε. Therefore, if we have a collection of intervals with total length less than δ, then the sum |F’(cᵢ)|(bᵢ - aᵢ) would be less than or equal to ∫_A |F’| < ε, where A is the union of the intervals. But does this hold?\n\nWait, the problem is that the points cᵢ are specific points where the Mean Value Theorem applies, but the integral over the union of intervals would be over all points in those intervals, not just at the points cᵢ. So this approach might not directly work because the sum is over specific points, and the integral is over the entire interval. However, if F’ is integrable, then by the absolute continuity of the integral, for any ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that if the measure of A is less than δ, then ∫_A |F’| < ε. If we can relate the sum |F(bᵢ) - F(aᵢ)| to the integral over the union of the intervals, then we can make it work.\n\nBut using the Mean Value Theorem, each |F(bᵢ) - F(aᵢ)| = |F’(cᵢ)|(bᵢ - aᵢ). So sum |F(bᵢ) - F(aᵢ)| = sum |F’(cᵢ)|(bᵢ - aᵢ). If the points cᵢ are spread out over the intervals, can we bound this sum by ∫_A |F’(x)| dx, where A is the union of the intervals? If F’ is non-negative, then this sum would be less than or equal to the integral over A, by the averaging effect. But if F’ can be both positive and negative, maybe not. However, since we take absolute values, sum |F’(cᵢ)|(bᵢ - aᵢ) is like a Riemann sum for the integral of |F’(x)| over A. But since the partition is arbitrary and F’ is only Lebesgue integrable, not necessarily Riemann integrable, this might not hold. So perhaps this approach is flawed.\n\nAlternatively, consider that F(x) = F(a) + ∫ₐˣ F’(t) dt, which would hold if F is absolutely continuous. But since we need to prove F is absolutely continuous, we can't assume this. However, if we can establish this equality under the given conditions, then F would be expressed as an integral, hence absolutely continuous.\n\nTo show F(x) - F(a) = ∫ₐˣ F’(t) dt, perhaps use the Henstock-Kurzweil integral, which can integrate derivatives without requiring absolute continuity. But I'm not sure if that's necessary here. The problem states that F’ is integrable, presumably in the Lebesgue sense. So maybe the idea is that since F is continuous and differentiable everywhere with integrable derivative, then F must be the integral of its derivative, and hence absolutely continuous.\n\nI think this is a standard result in real analysis. The theorem is: If F is continuous on [a, b], differentiable at every point of (a, b), and F’ is Lebesgue integrable on [a, b], then F is absolutely continuous on [a, b], and F(x) - F(a) = ∫ₐˣ F’(t) dt for all x in [a, b]. The proof of this often uses the Vitali covering theorem or the absolute continuity of the integral. But how to connect this with the given hint about F’ ≥0 a.e. implying F is increasing.\n\nMaybe the hint is suggesting the following approach: Suppose F’ is integrable. Then write F as the difference of two functions, each of which has a non-negative derivative a.e. For example, let F’ = F’⁺ - F’⁻, where F’⁺ is the positive part and F’⁻ is the negative part. Then define G(x) = ∫ₐˣ F’⁺(t) dt and H(x) = ∫ₐˣ F’⁻(t) dt. Then G and H are both increasing functions because their derivatives are non-negative a.e. Hence, F(x) = G(x) - H(x) + C, where C is a constant. Since G and H are absolutely continuous (as integrals of L¹ functions), their difference is also absolutely continuous, hence F is absolutely continuous.\n\nBut wait, this approach requires knowing that F(x) = F(a) + G(x) - H(x), which is equivalent to F(x) - F(a) = ∫ₐˣ F’(t) dt. But how do we establish this equality without assuming F is absolutely continuous? This is the crux. The user's book hint might be a step towards proving this decomposition.\n\nAlternatively, suppose we use the hint that F’ ≥0 a.e. implies F is increasing. Then, for the general case where F’ is integrable, we can decompose F’ into positive and negative parts. Let F’ = F’⁺ - F’⁻. Then, if we can show that the integral of F’⁺ is increasing and the integral of F’⁻ is decreasing, then F would be expressed as the difference of two increasing functions. However, since the integrals are absolutely continuous, their difference would be absolutely continuous. But again, this requires knowing that F equals the integral of F’ plus a constant.\n\nMaybe the key idea is to show that F is equal to its integral, and since the integral is absolutely continuous, F must be too. But how to bridge that gap.\n\nAnother angle: The problem states that F is continuous, differentiable everywhere with integrable derivative. To show F is absolutely continuous, suppose we take a collection of intervals. We need to bound the sum of |F(bᵢ) - F(aᵢ)|. By the Mean Value Theorem, each |F(bᵢ) - F(aᵢ)| = |F’(cᵢ)| (bᵢ - aᵢ) for some cᵢ in (aᵢ, bᵢ). The sum is then ∑ |F’(cᵢ)| (bᵢ - aᵢ). Now, since F’ is integrable, given ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that if the total measure of the intervals is less than δ, then ∫_∪[aᵢ,bᵢ]} |F’| dx < ε. However, the sum ∑ |F’(cᵢ)| (bᵢ - aᵢ) is like a Riemann sum, but since F’ is only Lebesgue integrable, not necessarily Riemann integrable, this might not directly compare to the integral. However, using the fact that Lebesgue integrable functions can be approximated by continuous functions, maybe we can make this rigorous. Alternatively, use the absolute continuity of the integral: For any ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that if the measure of a set A is less than δ, then ∫_A |F’| dx < ε. Then, if the total length of the intervals is less than δ, then ∫_∪[aᵢ,bᵢ]} |F’| dx < ε. But the sum ∑ |F’(cᵢ)| (bᵢ - aᵢ) is less than or equal to ∫_∪[aᵢ,bᵢ]} (|F’(x)| + η) dx for some η, by density of continuous functions? I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe apply the Vitali covering theorem to cover the intervals with Vitali covers and relate the sum to the integral. But this seems complicated.\n\nWait, here's another thought. If we can show that F is absolutely continuous by verifying that it satisfies the definition using the integrability of F’. Since F’ is integrable, its integral is absolutely continuous. Therefore, for any ε > 0, choose δ such that if the total length of intervals is less than δ, then the integral of |F’| over those intervals is less than ε. Then, using the Mean Value Theorem, the sum |F(bᵢ) - F(aᵢ)| = sum |F’(cᵢ)| (bᵢ - aᵢ). But how is this sum related to the integral? If we could say that sum |F’(cᵢ)| (bᵢ - aᵢ) ≤ ∫_∪[aᵢ,bᵢ]} |F’(x)| dx, but that's not necessarily true unless F’ is non-negative or we have some kind of averaging. For example, if F’ is positive, then the sum is like a lower Riemann sum, but since F’ can vary, we can't be sure. However, by the integral's absolute continuity, the sum can be controlled. Wait, actually, for any simple function dominated by |F’|, the integral over the union of intervals would bound the sum. But the points cᵢ are specific. This seems tricky.\n\nAlternatively, consider that F(x) = ∫ₐˣ F’(t) dt + C, and since the integral is absolutely continuous, F is absolutely continuous. But to prove that F(x) equals the integral, we need to show that F(x) - F(a) = ∫ₐˣ F’(t) dt. To do this, note that both sides are continuous functions (since F is continuous and the integral is continuous). Their derivatives exist everywhere in (a, b) and are equal to F’(x). If two functions have the same derivative everywhere on (a, b) and are continuous on [a, b], then they differ by a constant. Hence, F(x) - F(a) = ∫ₐˣ F’(t) dt. Therefore, F is equal to an absolutely continuous function plus a constant, hence F is absolutely continuous.\n\nWait, this seems like the way to go. Let me elaborate:\n\n1. Define G(x) = F(a) + ∫ₐˣ F’(t) dt. Then G is absolutely continuous because it's an integral of an L¹ function.\n\n2. G is differentiable almost everywhere with G’(x) = F’(x) a.e. (by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for Lebesgue integrals).\n\n3. However, F is differentiable everywhere in (a, b) with derivative F’(x).\n\n4. Consider H(x) = F(x) - G(x). Then H is continuous on [a, b], and differentiable everywhere in (a, b) with H’(x) = F’(x) - G’(x). But since G’(x) = F’(x) a.e., H’(x) = 0 a.e.\n\n5. Now, H is continuous on [a, b] and differentiable everywhere in (a, b) with H’(x) = 0 a.e. Can we conclude that H is constant?\n\n6. If yes, then F(x) = G(x) + C, hence F is absolutely continuous as the sum of an absolutely continuous function and a constant.\n\nBut how to show that H is constant. The problem is that H’(x) = 0 almost everywhere, but H is differentiable everywhere in (a, b). Wait, no. Wait, H is differentiable everywhere in (a, b) because both F and G are differentiable everywhere. Wait, no. G(x) = ∫ₐˣ F’(t) dt. G is differentiable almost everywhere with derivative F’(x) a.e., but not necessarily everywhere. Wait, but F is differentiable everywhere, G is differentiable a.e. Hence, H = F - G is differentiable everywhere where G is differentiable, which is a.e. So actually, H is differentiable a.e., and at those points, H’(x) = 0. But we need to show H is constant.\n\nHowever, H is continuous on [a, b], and differentiable a.e. with H’(x) = 0 a.e. If we can apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for Lebesgue integrals here, then since H is absolutely continuous if and only if H’ is integrable and H(x) - H(a) = ∫ₐˣ H’(t) dt. But we don't know if H is absolutely continuous. However, H’ = 0 a.e., so if H were absolutely continuous, then H would be constant. But how do we know H is absolutely continuous?\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that a continuous function with derivative zero everywhere except a countable set is constant. But in our case, H’ = 0 a.e., which is a much larger set than countable. However, the Cantor function is continuous, differentiable a.e. with derivative zero a.e., but it's not constant. So this approach doesn’t work unless we have additional conditions.\n\nBut in our case, H is continuous and differentiable everywhere in (a, b) except for a measure zero set. Wait, no. F is differentiable everywhere in (a, b), G is differentiable a.e. in (a, b), so H = F - G is differentiable everywhere except where G is not differentiable, which is a measure zero set. Therefore, H is differentiable everywhere in (a, b) except a measure zero set, and at points where it is differentiable, H’(x) = F’(x) - G’(x) = 0 a.e. So actually, H’(x) = 0 at almost every x in (a, b). However, H is not necessarily differentiable everywhere, but it is differentiable a.e. But even if H were differentiable everywhere with H’(x) = 0 a.e., as in the Cantor function case, we can't conclude H is constant. So this approach is stuck.\n\nWait, but in our case, H is differentiable everywhere in (a, b) except for a measure zero set. But actually, G is only differentiable a.e., so H is differentiable a.e., not necessarily everywhere. Hence, H is differentiable a.e., and H’ = 0 a.e. But how does that help? We need another approach.\n\nLet me go back to the hint. The book suggests showing that if F’(x) ≥0 a.e., then F is increasing. The user did that but doesn't see how it helps. Maybe the idea is to use this result to decompose F into increasing functions.\n\nSuppose F’ is integrable. Let’s write F’ = F’⁺ - F’⁻, where F’⁺ is the positive part and F’⁻ is the negative part. Define G(x) = ∫ₐˣ F’⁺(t) dt and H(x) = ∫ₐˣ F’⁻(t) dt. Then G and H are both increasing functions because their derivatives are non-negative a.e. Hence, F(x) = G(x) - H(x) + C, where C is a constant (since F(a) = G(a) - H(a) + C implies C = F(a)).\n\nNow, if G and H are absolutely continuous (since they are integrals of L¹ functions), then F, being their difference plus a constant, is also absolutely continuous. But how do we know F(x) = G(x) - H(x) + C? This requires that F(x) - F(a) = ∫ₐˣ F’(t) dt = G(x) - H(x). But this is only true if F(x) - F(a) = ∫ₐˣ F’(t) dt. So we’re back to needing to show that F is the integral of its derivative, which again requires F to be absolutely continuous. This seems circular.\n\nWait, but if we can use the result from the hint that F’ ≥0 a.e. implies F is increasing, then perhaps G and H, being integrals of non-negative functions, are increasing. Hence, their difference F is the difference of two increasing functions, hence of bounded variation. Since F is continuous and of bounded variation, F can be expressed as the difference of two increasing continuous functions. But does this imply absolute continuity? No, because the Cantor function is continuous and of bounded variation but not absolutely continuous. So this approach also doesn’t suffice.\n\nBut wait, the Cantor function has derivative zero a.e., but in our case, F’ is integrable and F is expressed as the difference of two integrals of non-negative functions. Maybe the key is that G and H are absolutely continuous because they are integrals, hence their difference is absolutely continuous. Therefore, F must be absolutely continuous. But this requires that F is equal to G - H + C, which requires F(x) - F(a) = ∫ₐˣ F’(t) dt. Again, this is the crux.\n\nPerhaps the missing link is to show that under the given conditions, F(x) - F(a) = ∫ₐˣ F’(t) dt. Once this is established, then F is absolutely continuous. To prove this equality, one could use the Henstock-Kurzweil integral, which integrates derivatives, but the problem states F’ is Lebesgue integrable. Alternatively, there's a theorem that states if F is differentiable everywhere with derivative in L¹, then F is the integral of its derivative. This is known in the literature as the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for the Lebesgue integral, but it requires F to be absolutely continuous. However, we are in a circular situation.\n\nWait, perhaps using the fact that F is continuous and has derivative F’(x) everywhere except a countable set (which we don't have here; we have differentiability everywhere), and F’ is integrable, then F is absolutely continuous. The key theorem here is by Ernest Michael and Zygmunt Zahorski, but I might be misremembering.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the following approach inspired by the hint. Assume that F’(x) ≥0 a.e., which implies F is increasing. Now, if F is increasing and continuous, then F is absolutely continuous if and only if it maps measure zero sets to measure zero sets, according to the classical Vitali theorem. But how does this help in the general case?\n\nAlternatively, if F’ is integrable, then the measure induced by F, i.e., the Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure μ_F, is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure because μ_F(E) = ∫_E F’(x) dx. Hence, F is absolutely continuous. But to make this precise, we need to know that F is the integral of F’, which again requires F to be absolutely continuous.\n\nThis seems to be going in circles. The key issue is proving that F(x) - F(a) = ∫ₐˣ F’(t) dt under the given conditions. Once this is shown, the rest follows. Here's a possible path:\n\nSince F is continuous on [a, b] and differentiable everywhere on (a, b) with F’ integrable, we can apply the Mean Value Theorem for integrals. For any x in [a, b], consider the difference quotient (F(x + h) - F(x))/h = F’(c) for some c in (x, x + h). As h approaches 0, c approaches x, and since F’ is integrable, by the Dominated Convergence Theorem, the integral of F’ over [a, x] is F(x) - F(a). Wait, no, the DCT applies to sequences, but how to apply it here.\n\nAlternatively, consider using the fact that the derivative F’ is the limit of difference quotients, and since F’ is integrable, integrating both sides should give back F. But this is heuristic.\n\nI think the correct approach is to use the fact that F is differentiable everywhere and F’ is integrable, then by the Banach-Zaretsky theorem, if a function is continuous, has bounded variation, and maps measure zero sets to measure zero sets, then it's absolutely continuous. But to use this, we need to show F has bounded variation and the Lusin (N) property.\n\nAlternatively, here's a direct method from a textbook: Since F is continuous and differentiable everywhere with F’ integrable, for any partition a = x₀ < x₁ < ... < xₙ = b, the sum Σ |F(xᵢ) - F(xᵢ₋₁)| can be written as Σ |∫_{xᵢ₋₁}^{xᵢ} F’(t) dt| ≤ Σ ∫_{xᵢ₋₁}^{xᵢ} |F’(t)| dt = ∫_a^b |F’(t)| dt. Wait, but this only holds if F(xᵢ) - F(xᵢ₋₁) = ∫_{xᵢ₋₁}^{xᵢ} F’(t) dt. But we don't know that yet. If we can establish that F(x) - F(y) = ∫_y^x F’(t) dt for any [y, x] ⊂ [a, b], then the total variation of F is exactly ∫_a^b |F’(t)| dt, which is finite, so F is of bounded variation and absolutely continuous. But again, this requires proving that F is the integral of F’.\n\nI think I need to recall a specific theorem. In Royden's Real Analysis, the theorem states that if F is absolutely continuous on [a, b], then it is differentiable a.e., F’ is integrable, and F(x) - F(a) = ∫_a^x F’(t) dt. The converse is also true: if F is differentiable everywhere (or a.e.), F’ is integrable, and F(x) - F(a) = ∫_a^x F’(t) dt, then F is absolutely continuous. But in our problem, we are given that F is differentiable everywhere and F’ is integrable, but we need to prove F is absolutely continuous, which requires proving F is the integral of F’.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to proving that under the given conditions, F(x) - F(a) = ∫_a^x F’(t) dt. To do this, one can use the fact that the difference F(x) - [F(a) + ∫_a^x F’(t) dt] has derivative zero everywhere in (a, b) and is continuous, hence must be constant. But as we saw earlier, this requires that the derivative of the integral ∫_a^x F’(t) dt is equal to F’(x) everywhere, which is not necessarily true since the integral's derivative is equal to F’(x) almost everywhere, not everywhere.\n\nWait, but F is differentiable everywhere, and the integral G(x) = ∫_a^x F’(t) dt is differentiable almost everywhere with G’(x) = F’(x) a.e. Then the difference H(x) = F(x) - G(x) has derivative H’(x) = F’(x) - G’(x) = 0 a.e. But H is continuous. How can we conclude H is constant?\n\nThis seems to require a lemma that a continuous function with derivative zero almost everywhere is constant. But as the Cantor function shows, this is not true. However, the Cantor function is not differentiable everywhere—it's differentiable a.e. but not everywhere. In our case, H is differentiable everywhere in (a, b) except where G is not differentiable, which is a measure zero set. So H is differentiable everywhere except a measure zero set, and at points where it is differentiable, the derivative is zero. But even so, we can't conclude H is constant unless H is absolutely continuous.\n\nThis is a known result: If a function is continuous, has zero derivative everywhere except a measure zero set, and is absolutely continuous, then it's constant. But we don't know H is absolutely continuous. However, H is continuous and of bounded variation if F is of bounded variation. But how do we know F is of bounded variation?\n\nAlternatively, let's use the given hint. The book suggests showing that if F’ ≥0 a.e., then F is increasing. Suppose we can use this to decompose F into increasing functions. For example, if F’ is integrable, we can write F’ = F’⁺ - F’⁻, then F = G - H + C, where G and H are increasing. Since G and H are increasing and their derivatives are non-negative a.e., by the hint, they are increasing. If we can show G and H are absolutely continuous, then F is the difference of two absolutely continuous functions, hence absolutely continuous.\n\nBut again, how to show G and H are absolutely continuous. If G(x) = ∫_a^x F’⁺(t) dt, then since F’⁺ is integrable, G is absolutely continuous. Similarly for H. Hence, F = G - H + C is absolutely continuous. This approach works if we can justify that F = ∫_a^x F’(t) dt + C. But to show that, we need to show H(x) = F(x) - (G(x) - H(x)) - C = 0, which again requires knowing F(x) = G(x) - H(x) + C.\n\nBut wait, if we define G and H as the integrals of F’⁺ and F’⁻, then F’ = F’⁺ - F’⁻, so integrating both sides from a to x gives ∫_a^x F’(t) dt = G(x) - H(x). If we can show that F(x) - F(a) = G(x) - H(x), then F(x) = F(a) + G(x) - H(x), hence F is absolutely continuous. But how to show F(x) - F(a) = ∫_a^x F’(t) dt?\n\nThis brings us back to the original problem. The missing step is proving that F(x) - F(a) = ∫_a^x F’(t) dt under the given conditions. Once this is established, the conclusion follows. To prove this, we can use the following approach:\n\nConsider the function H(x) = F(x) - F(a) - ∫_a^x F’(t) dt. H is continuous on [a, b] (since F is continuous and the integral is continuous). H(a) = 0. The derivative H’(x) exists for all x in (a, b) and is equal to F’(x) - F’(x) = 0. Therefore, H’(x) = 0 for all x in (a, b). By the Mean Value Theorem, if a function has derivative zero everywhere on an interval, it is constant. Since H(a) = 0, H(x) = 0 for all x in [a, b]. Hence, F(x) - F(a) = ∫_a^x F’(t) dt.\n\nWait, this seems to work! Because H is differentiable everywhere on (a, b) with H’(x) = 0 for all x in (a, b). Therefore, by the Mean Value Theorem, H is constant. Since H(a) = 0, H(x) = 0 everywhere. Hence, F(x) = F(a) + ∫_a^x F’(t) dt, which is absolutely continuous because it's an integral of an L¹ function.\n\nBut wait, in our case, H’(x) = F’(x) - F’(x) = 0 for all x in (a, b). Therefore, H is a constant function. Hence, H(x) = H(a) = 0. Therefore, F(x) = F(a) + ∫_a^x F’(t) dt. This shows that F is absolutely continuous.\n\nBut why did I earlier think there was a problem? Because I confused the differentiability of G(x) = ∫_a^x F’(t) dt. However, in this case, H(x) = F(x) - G(x) has derivative zero everywhere in (a, b), not just almost everywhere. Therefore, the Mean Value Theorem applies, and H is constant. Therefore, F(x) = G(x) + C, hence F is absolutely continuous.\n\nTherefore, the key realization is that H’(x) = 0 everywhere in (a, b), not just a.e., because F’(x) exists everywhere and G’(x) = F’(x) everywhere (since G(x) = ∫_a^x F’(t) dt, and the derivative of the integral is F’(x) wherever F’(x) is continuous. Wait, no. The derivative of G(x) = ∫_a^x F’(t) dt is F’(x) only almost everywhere, by the FTC for Lebesgue integrals. But in our case, H’(x) = F’(x) - G’(x). However, F’(x) exists everywhere, but G’(x) exists almost everywhere. Therefore, H’(x) exists almost everywhere and equals zero there. But H is continuous, differentiable a.e. with H’=0 a.e., but we need to show H is constant. But as the Cantor function example shows, this isn’t generally true. However, in our case, H is differentiable everywhere in (a, b) with H’(x) = 0, but that's not true. Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nH(x) = F(x) - G(x). F is differentiable everywhere in (a, b), G is differentiable almost everywhere in (a, b) with G’(x) = F’(x) a.e. Therefore, H is differentiable almost everywhere in (a, b), and at those points, H’(x) = F’(x) - F’(x) = 0. But H is continuous on [a, b]. However, without knowing H is absolutely continuous, we can't conclude it's constant. This seems to contradict the earlier conclusion.\n\nWait, there's confusion here. Let me correct:\n\nIf H(x) = F(x) - G(x), then:\n\n- F is differentiable everywhere in (a, b).\n\n- G is differentiable almost everywhere in (a, b), with G’(x) = F’(x) a.e.\n\nTherefore, H is differentiable almost everywhere in (a, b), and at those points, H’(x) = F’(x) - G’(x) = 0.\n\nBut H is continuous. However, to conclude that H is constant, we need to know that H is absolutely continuous. But H is continuous and differentiable a.e. with H’=0 a.e. This is not sufficient, as the Cantor function ",
