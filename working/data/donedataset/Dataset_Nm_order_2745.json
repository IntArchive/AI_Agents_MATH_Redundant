    "Content": "I did the following proof and I was wondering if its valid. It feels wrong because I didn't actually test the case when purportedly $n$ is not prime, but please feel free to correct me. Assume there exists $n$ such that $\\phi(n) = 14$. Assume $n$ is prime. Then $\\phi(n) = n-1$. Then here, n-1 = 14, so n = 15. \nWe know since Euler's totient function is multiplicative that $\\phi(xy)$ = $\\phi(x)\\phi(y)$, so $\\phi(15) = \\phi(3)\\phi(5)$, but alas $\\phi(3)\\phi(5) = 2\\cdot4 = 8 \\ne 14$. If $n$ is not prime a similar argument follows since we know then that $n$ must be composed of prime numbers by the prime factorization theorem.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If a prime $p\\mid n$, then $p-1\\mid\\phi(n)$. If $\\phi(n)=14$, then, since the divisors of $14$ are $\\{1,2,7,14\\}$, $p\\in\\{2,3\\}$. Thus, $n=2^a3^b$ and $\\phi(n)$ is of the form $2^j3^k$. However, there is no factor of $7$ in $2^j3^k$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so the user wants me to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me start by understanding the original problem. The title is \"Show that there is no integer n with φ(n) = 14\". The user tried to prove it by considering n as prime and then not prime, but their approach might have gaps.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The original problem states that there is no integer n such that Euler's totient function φ(n) equals 14. The user assumes two scenarios: n is prime and n is composite. However, in the problem statement, the only explicit assumption is that there exists an integer n where φ(n) = 14. But wait, the problem is to show that no such n exists, so the assumption for contradiction would be \"Assume there exists an integer n such that φ(n) = 14\". However, in the example provided earlier, the assumptions listed were about the properties of n, like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". \n\nWait, in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. Wait, but in the original problem, the user didn't mention n being divisible by 7. Maybe the example was a misapplication. Let me check the example again. The original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem under assumptions had \"n is an integer\", \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", not necessarily divisible by 7. So maybe the example was incorrect? Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. Let me confirm.\n\nWait, the original problem in the example is to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem under assumptions lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But in reality, the problem doesn't require n to be divisible by 7; the user might have confused something here. Because 91 is 7*13, maybe the problem is structured under modulo 7 and 13. But the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumptions shouldn't include \"n is divisible by 7\". Therefore, the example might have an error. But regardless, I need to follow the user's format as per their example, even if it's incorrect. Wait, but the user says in the example that the original problem is to prove for every integer n, and the formatted problem lists assumptions as \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But that's conflicting because the problem statement is for all integers n, but the assumption adds an extra condition. So maybe the example is not correct, but the user wants me to follow their format, perhaps extracting assumptions from the problem's given conditions.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user's original question is \"Show that there is no integer n with φ(n) = 14\". The assumptions here would be that φ(n) = 14, and n is an integer. Wait, but the problem is to show that such n doesn't exist. So in the formatted problem, under assumptions, maybe the user wants the conditions that would lead to the problem. Wait, perhaps the assumptions are the given conditions of the problem. Let me look back at the example. In the example, the original problem is to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. Wait, but \"n is divisible by 7\" is not part of the original problem. It seems like the example is incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in their example, but they want me to structure the problem by listing all the assumptions from the problem statement. But if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", then the assumption should be \"n is an integer\". But the example adds an extra assumption that wasn't in the original problem, which is \"n is divisible by 7\". So maybe the user intended the assumptions to include both the problem's conditions and possibly some hidden constraints. This is confusing. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example is structured such that the problem is to prove divisibility by 91 under the assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem doesn't state that. So perhaps the example is wrong. But since the user provided that example, I need to follow their structure. Looking at the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", and the formatted problem's assumptions are \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". That suggests that the formatted problem added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem, which is conflicting. So perhaps the user made a mistake, but I need to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to filter out some unrelated information. For example, maybe in the original problem, the user mentioned n being divisible by 7, but it's a distraction. Wait, the example's original problem is \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so \"n is an integer\" is correct, but \"n is divisible by 7\" is not part of the original problem. Therefore, the example is incorrect, but the user provided it, so maybe in their mind, the assumptions are the given conditions. So perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions would be \"n is an integer\", \"φ(n) = 14\". But since the problem is to show that there's no such integer, maybe the assumption is \"Assume there exists an integer n such that φ(n) = 14\". But in the example, the assumptions are listed as properties of n, not as temporary assumptions for contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants to extract all the conditions given in the problem. In the original problem, the task is to show that no integer n satisfies φ(n)=14. So the problem is \"Prove that there is no integer n with φ(n) = 14.\" So the assumptions would be the conditions given in the problem, which is that φ(n)=14. But in the example, they listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. Wait, in the example's formatted problem, the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, given that n is an integer (since it's for every integer n). But they added \"n is divisible by 7\", which is not part of the original problem. This is conflicting. Therefore, perhaps the user's example is incorrect, and they intended to structure the problem's conditions. Alternatively, maybe the original problem in the example had a different setup where n was supposed to be divisible by 7, but the user presented it wrong.\n\nBut given that I need to follow the user's example, even if it's flawed, I need to proceed. Let me look at the current problem. The user's problem is \"Show that there is no integer n with φ(n) = 14\". The original question's problem statement is as given. The user's attempt assumes that n could be prime or composite. The formatted problem should list assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object.\n\nIn the example, they listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. So in the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is an integer\n- φ(n) = 14\n\nBut the problem is to show that no such integer exists, so perhaps the problem statement is \"Prove that there is no integer n such that φ(n) = 14\", and the assumptions are \"n is an integer\", \"φ(n) = 14\". But the user's example seems to have included more conditions. Alternatively, maybe the user in the example included some incorrect assumptions. But given the example, perhaps the way to structure this problem is:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nφ(n) = 14.\n\nProblem:\nShow that there is no integer n with φ(n) = 14.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to show that no such n exists. So if we list the assumptions as \"n is an integer\" and \"φ(n)=14\", then the problem would be to derive a contradiction from these assumptions, i.e., show that such n cannot exist. But in the example, the problem is to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 under the assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So perhaps the user is extracting all possible conditions on n, including those that are not explicit but part of the problem's context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example is a misrepresentation, and the correct way is to list the problem's given conditions. So in the current problem, the given condition is that φ(n)=14, and we need to show that no integer n satisfies this. Therefore, the assumptions would be \"n is an integer\", \"φ(n) = 14\", and the problem is to show that this leads to a contradiction, i.e., such n does not exist. But in the example, the problem statement was rephrased as \"Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91\" under the assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So perhaps the user wants to list all the conditions on n, even if they are not explicitly stated. For instance, in the example, the problem is for every integer n, so n is an integer is an assumption, but why is \"n is divisible by 7\" an assumption? That seems incorrect. Unless there was a mistake in the example.\n\nIn any case, given the user's example, even if incorrect, I need to follow their structure. For the current problem, the original question is to show there's no integer n with φ(n)=14. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is an integer\n- φ(n) = 14\n\nBut the problem is to show that no such n exists, which is the same as proving that these assumptions lead to a contradiction. So perhaps the formatted problem would list those assumptions and the problem is to show that no integer n satisfies φ(n)=14. Alternatively, the problem statement might just be \"Show that there is no integer n with φ(n) = 14\", and the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. Wait, but the problem is to show that such n doesn't exist, so there are no assumptions except that we are considering integers n. But in the example, they included both \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Maybe the key is to extract all explicit and implicit conditions. For example, in the current problem, the implicit condition is that n is a positive integer (since φ(n) is defined for positive integers). So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- n is a positive integer\n- φ(n) = 14\n\nProblem: Show that there is no integer n with φ(n) = 14.\n\nBut in the example, they didn't specify positive, but φ(n) is defined for n ≥ 1. So maybe the user expects to list \"n is a positive integer\" as an assumption. However, the original problem's title says \"integer n\", but Euler's totient function is only defined for positive integers. Therefore, the correct assumptions would be \"n is a positive integer\" and \"φ(n) = 14\". The problem is to show that no such positive integer exists. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nφ(n) = 14.\n\nProblem:\nShow that there is no integer n with φ(n) = 14.\n\nBut the problem statement in the user's example didn't include \"positive\", but perhaps it's implied. Therefore, to align with the example, which lists \"n is an integer\" even if φ(n) requires n to be positive, maybe the user just wants \"n is an integer\". But technically, φ(n) is only defined for positive integers. However, the original problem's title says \"integer n\", which might be a mistake. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is a positive integer\n- φ(n) = 14\n\nProblem: Show that there is no positive integer n with φ(n) = 14.\n\nBut the original problem's title says \"integer n\", which is technically incorrect. So perhaps the user intended n to be a positive integer. Therefore, structuring the problem accordingly. The user's example might have had an error, but I need to proceed with the correct assumptions. Therefore, the answer should list the assumptions as \"n is a positive integer\" and \"φ(n) = 14\", and the problem is to show that no such n exists.",
