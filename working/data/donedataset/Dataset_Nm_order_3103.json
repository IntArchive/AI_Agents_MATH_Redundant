    "Content": "I am having difficulty answering the following question on \"Notes on Set Theory\" by Moschovakis, 1st edition: Prove that the set $K$ of all monotone real functions on the closed interval $[0,1]$ have the same cardinality with $\\mathbb R$. We can inject $\\mathbb R$ into $K$ by sending any real number to its constant function, e.g. $5/2$ gets mapped to the constant function $5/2$ on $[0,1]$. By Schroder-Berstein theorem, it suffices to provide an injection from $K$ to $\\mathbb R$. As the set of constant functions in $K$ have cardinality of $\\mathbb R$, strictly decreasing function in $K$ (by which I mean that such a function $f$ has some $a > b$ st. $f(a) <f(b)$, i.e. $f$ need not be strictly decreasing in the whole interval) is in bijective correspondence with strictly increasing function in $K$, and $|\\mathbb R^3| = |\\mathbb R|$, it suffices to show that the set of strictly increasing function in $K$ injects to $\\mathbb R$. However, I am not sure how I can provide such an injection.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The set of discontinuities of an increasing function is at most countable . Therefore $f \\in K$ is completely described by its set of discontinuities $D$ and its values on $\\mathbb{Q} \\cap [0,1]$. Indeed, if $f$ is continuous at $x$, then $f(x) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} f(q_n)$ where $(q_n)_n$ is some sequence of rationals converging to $x$. If $f$ is discontinuous at $x$, then the value $f(x)$ is already given. Therefore we have a bijection of $K$ with $$\\{(D, (x_n)_n) : D \\subseteq [0,1]\\text{ at most countable}, x_n \\in [0,1], \\forall n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\}$$ so $$|K| = c^{\\aleph_0} \\cdot c^{\\aleph_0} = c$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me start by understanding the original problem.\n\nThe task is to prove that the set K of all monotone real functions on [0,1] has the same cardinality as ℝ. The user mentions using the Schröder-Bernstein theorem by showing injections both ways. They already know that injecting ℝ into K is straightforward via constant functions. The challenge is creating an injection from K to ℝ. They suggest focusing on strictly increasing functions since other cases can be handled via bijections and properties of ℝ³'s cardinality.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem mentions monotone functions on [0,1]. So the domain is the closed interval [0,1]. Each function in K is monotone, which can be either non-decreasing or non-increasing. However, the user splits K into constant, strictly increasing, and strictly decreasing functions. Wait, the original problem says \"monotone,\" which typically includes both non-decreasing and non-increasing. But the user's approach is to handle strictly increasing and strictly decreasing separately, along with constants. However, strictly speaking, a monotonic function could be non-decreasing or non-increasing but not necessarily strictly. But maybe in this context, the user is considering all monotone functions, which can be partitioned into constant, strictly increasing, and strictly decreasing. However, there's a nuance here: a non-decreasing function might not be strictly increasing but still not constant. For example, a function that increases on some intervals and is constant on others. Hmm, but perhaps the key is that any monotone function can be uniquely represented by its points of increase, decrease, or constancy. But maybe the user's approach is to note that the set of all monotone functions can be broken down into these categories, and since each can be injected into ℝ, then overall K can be injected into ℝ.\n\nWait, the user's thought process mentions that strictly decreasing functions are in bijection with strictly increasing functions (probably via some transformation like f(x) -> -f(x)), so the cardinality of strictly decreasing is the same as strictly increasing. Then they note that |ℝ³| = |ℝ|, so if they can inject the strictly increasing functions into ℝ, then combining with constants and the bijection for decreasing functions, the total would be manageable via cardinal arithmetic.\n\nBut the problem statement as given in the question is to prove |K| = |ℝ|. The assumptions needed for the problem would be the conditions given in the problem: the set K consists of all monotone real functions on [0,1]. So when structuring the problem into the required format, the assumptions should be the properties given in the problem. The user might have some incorrect assumptions in their approach, but the problem itself doesn't state any additional conditions beyond the functions being monotone on [0,1].\n\nWait, looking back at the example provided in the initial instructions: in the example, the original problem had an expression A(n), and the user structured the assumptions as n being an integer and n being divisible by 7. But in the original problem statement, the user had written \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added the assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like a mistake. Wait the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should just be that n is an integer, but in the formatted example, they added \"n is divisible by 7\", which might be part of a specific problem's requirement. Wait, no, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. So the formatted problem in the example incorrectly added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which is not part of the original problem. That seems like an error. Therefore, the example might be incorrect. But the user's instruction is to structure the problem by extracting the assumptions from the original question. So in the given example, perhaps the assistant made a mistake.\n\nBut in the current problem, we need to make sure we correctly extract the assumptions from the original problem. The original problem states: Prove that the set K of all monotone real functions on [0,1] has the same cardinality as ℝ. Therefore, the assumptions here are:\n\n1. K is the set of all monotone real functions on the interval [0,1].\n2. The problem is set in the context of real numbers (since functions are real-valued).\n3. Monotone here refers to either non-decreasing or non-increasing functions.\n\nHowever, in the example given by the user, the assumptions were split into each line addressing only one property or condition applied to one object. So in the example, they listed \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. Wait, but in the original example problem, the user's formatted problem added an assumption not present in the original problem. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect, but maybe it was a typo. Regardless, the current task is to process the given Math Stack Exchange question correctly.\n\nBack to the current problem. The problem is to show that K (monotone functions on [0,1]) has the same cardinality as ℝ. The assumptions needed are those given in the problem statement. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- K is the set of all monotone real functions defined on the interval [0,1].\n- Monotonicity is in the sense of being either non-decreasing or non-increasing.\n\nWait, but the problem statement doesn't specify whether the functions are strictly monotone or just monotone (i.e., non-decreasing or non-increasing). The question says \"monotone\", which generally includes both non-strict and strict, but in the user's reasoning, they split into strictly increasing, strictly decreasing, and constant functions. However, in reality, a non-decreasing function can have intervals where it's constant and intervals where it's increasing. But perhaps for cardinality purposes, the exact type of monotonicity (strict or non-strict) doesn't matter because the key is that each monotone function can be associated with some countable set of points (discontinuities or points where the function changes behavior), and since there are continuum many such functions, the cardinality is that of the continuum.\n\nBut regardless, the problem as stated says \"monotone\", so the assumptions are just that K consists of all such functions. Therefore, in the structured format:\n\nAssumption:\nEach function in K is a real-valued function on the interval [0,1],\nEach function in K is monotonic (either non-decreasing or non-increasing).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the set K has the same cardinality as ℝ.\n\nWait, but according to the example, each assumption line addresses only one property applied to one object. So maybe split into:\n\nAssumption:\nK is a set of functions,\nEach function in K has domain [0,1],\nEach function in K is real-valued,\nEach function in K is monotonic.\n\nBut perhaps the problem's original statement doesn't explicitly state all these, but the question says \"the set of all monotone real functions on [0,1]\". So \"monotone real functions on [0,1]\" implies that each function is from [0,1] to ℝ, and monotonic. So to list each assumption line by line:\n\nAssumption:\nK is the set of all monotone functions,\nEach function in K has domain [0,1],\nEach function in K is real-valued.\n\nAlternatively, combining \"monotone real functions on [0,1]\" into separate lines. But according to the example, each line is one property for one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nEach element of K is a function from [0,1] to ℝ,\nEach element of K is monotonic.\n\nBut maybe \"monotonic\" can be split into non-decreasing or non-increasing, but the problem just states \"monotone\", which includes both. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nK is the set of all functions f: [0,1] → ℝ,\nEach function f in K is monotonic.\n\nAlternatively, to follow the example's structure, which listed two separate assumptions about the same object (n is integer, n is divisible by 7), even though the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7. Wait, that might have been a mistake in the example, but perhaps in the current problem, we need to stick to the actual given information.\n\nTherefore, the correct assumptions here are:\n\n- The domain of each function in K is the interval [0,1].\n- Each function in K is real-valued.\n- Each function in K is monotonic (either non-decreasing or non-increasing).\n\nBut the problem statement is exactly as given: Prove that the set K of all monotone real functions on [0,1] has the same cardinality as ℝ. So the problem is already self-contained. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nK consists of all monotone real functions on [0,1],\nMonotonicity is in the sense of being non-decreasing or non-increasing.\n\nBut to break into separate lines as per the example:\n\nAssumption:\nEach function in K is defined on the interval [0,1],\nEach function in K is real-valued,\nEach function in K is monotonic.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the set K has the same cardinality as ℝ.\n\nBut the original problem mentions that K is the set of all monotone real functions on [0,1], so perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nK is the set of all monotone functions from [0,1] to ℝ.\n\nBut maybe splitting:\n\nAssumption:\nThe domain of each function in K is [0,1],\nThe codomain of each function in K is ℝ,\nEach function in K is monotonic.\n\nThis way, each line is one property. Yes, that makes sense. Each line addresses one property applied to one object (the functions in K). So:\n\nAssumption:\nEach function in K has domain [0,1],\nEach function in K has codomain ℝ,\nEach function in K is monotonic.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the set K has the same cardinality as ℝ.\n\nAlternatively, the problem statement in the user's original question is exactly: \"Prove that the set K of all monotone real functions on [0,1] have the same cardinality with ℝ.\" So the problem is already concise. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nEach function in K is a real-valued function on [0,1],\nEach function in K is monotonic.\n\nProblem:\nProve that K has the same cardinality as ℝ.\n\nI think this is sufficient. The key is that each assumption is a single condition on one object. The codomain is ℝ, domain is [0,1], and monotonicity. Each of these is a separate condition on the functions in K.",
