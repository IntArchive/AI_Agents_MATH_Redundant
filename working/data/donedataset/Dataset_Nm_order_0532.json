    "Content": "For any $x\\in\\mathbb{R}$, the series\n$$ \\sum_{n\\geq 1}\\tfrac{1}{n}\\,\\sin\\left(\\tfrac{x}{n}\\right) $$\nis trivially absolutely convergent. It defines a function $f(x)$ and I would like to show that $f(x)$ is unbounded over $\\mathbb{R}$ . Here there are my thoughts/attempts: $$(\\mathcal{L} f)(s) = \\sum_{n\\geq 1}\\frac{1}{1+n^2 s^2} = \\frac{-s+\\pi\\coth\\frac{\\pi}{s}}{2s}=\\sum_{m\\geq 1}\\frac{(-1)^{m+1}\\,\\zeta(2m)}{s^{2m}}$$\nis a function with no secrets. It behaves like $\\frac{\\pi}{2s}$ in a right neighbourhood of the origin, like $\\frac{\\pi^2}{6s^2}$ in a left neighbourhood of $+\\infty$. The origin is an essential singularity and there are simple poles at each $s$ of the form $\\pm\\frac{i}{m}$ with $m\\in\\mathbb{N}^+$. These facts do not seem to rule out the possibility that $f$ is bounded; For any $N\\in\\mathbb{N}^+$ there clearly is some $x\\ll e^N$ such that $\\sin(x),\\sin\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right),\\ldots,\\sin\\left(\\frac{x}{N}\\right)$ are all positive and large enough, making a partial sum of $ \\sum_{n\\geq 1}\\tfrac{1}{n}\\,\\sin\\left(\\tfrac{x}{n}\\right) $ pretty close to $C\\log N$. On the other hand I do not see an effective way for controlling  $ \\sum_{n>N}\\tfrac{1}{n}\\,\\sin\\left(\\tfrac{x}{n}\\right) $ - maybe by summation by parts, by exploiting the bounded-ness of the sine integral function? Some probabilistic argument might be effective. For any $n\\geq 3$ we may define $E_n$ as the set of $x\\in\\mathbb{R}^+$ such that $\\sin\\left(\\frac{x}{n}\\right)\\geq \\frac{1}{\\log n}$. The density of any $E_n$ in $\\mathbb{R}^+$ is close to $\\frac{1}{2}$, so by a Borel-Cantellish argument it looks reasonable that the set of points such that $|f(x)|\\geq \\frac{\\log x}{100}$ is unbounded, but how to make it really rigorous? To compute $\\lim_{x\\to x_0}f(x)$ through convolutions with approximate identities seems doable but not really appealing.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Thanks to MartinR and HJol for referencing a classical result of Hardy and Littlewood , which I am going to outline. The final result is $$ \\sum_{n\\geq 1}\\frac{1}{n}\\,\\sin\\frac{x}{n}=\\Omega\\left(\\sqrt{\\log\\log x}\\right)\\text{ as }x\\to +\\infty.\\tag{FR}$$ Proof : Let $q$ be a number of the form $\\prod p^\\alpha$, where each prime $p$ is of the form $4n+1$. Since $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a UFD, the set of $q$s is the set of odd numbers which can be represented as a sum of two coprime squares. Let $K=\\prod_{q\\leq 4k+1}q$, $x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}K$  and $x_j=(4j+1)x$ for any $j\\in[1,K]$. By introducing\n$$ Q^*(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{K}\\frac{1}{n}\\,\\sin\\frac{x}{n}$$\nit is enough to approximate $Q^*$ evaluated at each $x_j$. If $n\\mid K$ then $\\frac{K}{n}$ is a number of the form $4n+1$ and $\\sin\\left(\\frac{x_j}{n}\\right)=1$, hence\n$$ Q^*(x_j) = \\sum_{n\\mid K}\\frac{1}{n}+\\sum_{\\substack{1\\leq n \\leq K\\\\ n\\nmid K}}\\frac{1}{n}\\,\\sin\\left(\\frac{x_j}{n}\\right)=\\lambda(k)+R(x_j)$$\nand\n$$ \\frac{1}{K}\\sum_{j=1}^{K}Q^*(x_j) = \\lambda(k)+\\frac{1}{K}\\sum_{\\substack{1\\leq n \\leq K\\\\ n\\nmid K}}\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{j=1}^{K}\\sin\\frac{(4j+1)x}{n}.$$\nIn the inner sum on the right, $\\frac{2x}{n}$ differs from $\\pi$ by at least $\\frac{C}{n}$, such that $\\left|\\sum_{j=1}^{K}\\sin\\frac{(4j+1)x}{n}\\right|\\ll\\frac{1}{\\left|\\sin\\frac{2x}{n}\\right|}=O(n)$ and the LHS of the above equation is $\\geq \\lambda(k)(1-\\varepsilon)$. On the other hand it is trivial that\n$$ \\lambda(k)\\geq \\sum_{q\\leq 4k+1}\\frac{1}{q}.$$\nLet $N(n)$ be the number of $q$ which do not exceed $n$. By sieve methods it is well-known that $N(n)\\sim\\frac{Dn}{\\sqrt{\\log n}}$, hence the inequality $$ \\sum_{q\\leq 4k+1}\\frac{1}{q}=\\sum_{n\\leq 4k+1}\\frac{N(n)-N(n-1)}{n}\\geq \\sum_{n\\leq 4k+1}\\frac{N(n)}{n(n+1)} $$\nfinishes the proof. Similarly it can be proved that $$ \\sum_{n\\geq 1}\\frac{1}{n}\\,\\cos\\frac{x}{n}=\\Omega\\left(\\log\\log x\\right)\\text{ as }x\\to +\\infty.\\tag{CR}$$ Alternative approaches : to replace $\\sum_{n=m}^{M}\\frac{1}{n}\\sin\\frac{x}{n}$ with a similarly shaped integral and to carefully estimate the error terms. A classical tool for performing such manipulations is the Denjoy-Koksma inequality . It can be combined with Van Der Corput's trick and known inequalities in order to produce interesting generalizations, as shown by Flett and Codecà .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants to show that the function f(x), defined by the series sum_{n≥1} (1/n) sin(x/n), is unbounded over the real numbers. \n\nFirst, let's look at the original question. The user mentions that the series is absolutely convergent, which makes sense because |sin(x/n)| ≤ 1, so each term is bounded by 1/n, and the sum of 1/n diverges. Wait, no, the absolute convergence would require the sum of |1/n sin(x/n)| to converge. But since |sin(x/n)| ≤ |x|/n for small x/n, but for fixed x, as n increases, sin(x/n) ~ x/n. So the absolute value of each term is roughly |x|/n², and the sum of 1/n² converges. Therefore, the series is absolutely convergent for each x. So the function f(x) is well-defined everywhere.\n\nBut the problem is to show that f(x) is unbounded. The user's thoughts mention using partial sums up to N, making them close to C log N, but needing to control the tail sum. They also mention probabilistic arguments, Borel-Cantelli-like reasoning, and some density considerations.\n\nSo the key assumptions here are:\n\n- The function f(x) is defined as the sum from n=1 to infinity of (1/n) sin(x/n).\n- The series is absolutely convergent for any real x (so f(x) exists for all x).\n- The goal is to show that f(x) is unbounded on ℝ.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the Assumptions section lists each condition applied to one object. So in this case:\n\nAssumptions:\n- For any real number x, the series ∑_{n≥1} (1/n) sin(x/n) is absolutely convergent.\n- The function f(x) is defined by f(x) = ∑_{n≥1} (1/n) sin(x/n).\n- The problem is to show that f(x) is unbounded over ℝ.\n\nBut wait, the original problem statement already says the series is \"trivially absolutely convergent,\" so that's a given condition. The function f(x) is defined by that series. The goal is to prove unboundedness.\n\nSo structuring according to the format:\n\nAssumption: Each line addresses one property. So:\n\n- For any real number x, the series ∑_{n≥1} (1/n) sin(x/n) is absolutely convergent.\n- The function f(x) is defined as ∑_{n≥1} (1/n) sin(x/n).\n- The problem is to show that f(x) is unbounded over ℝ.\n\nWait, but maybe the first two points are the assumptions, and the problem is the third. Let me check the example. In the example, the assumption includes that n is an integer and divisible by 7, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. So in this problem, the assumptions would be the given conditions, which are that the series is absolutely convergent (so f(x) is defined for all x) and the problem is to show it's unbounded.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption: \n- For any real number x, the series ∑_{n≥1} (1/n) sin(x/n) is absolutely convergent.\n- The function f(x) is defined as ∑_{n≥1} (1/n) sin(x/n).\n\nProblem:\nProve that f(x) is unbounded over ℝ.\n\nBut the original problem also mentions \"For any x∈ℝ\", which is covered by the first assumption. The user's thoughts include some attempts, like considering partial sums up to N, Laplace transforms, etc., but those aren't part of the problem's assumptions—they're part of their approach. So in the formatted problem, we should only include the given conditions from the problem statement, not the user's thoughts or attempts.\n\nTherefore, the key assumptions are that the series converges absolutely for any real x, defining f(x), and the problem is to show f is unbounded. So the formatted problem would be as above.",
