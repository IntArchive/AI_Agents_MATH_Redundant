    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $S$ be a finite set, and $f : S \\to S$ a function. Then the following are equivalent: $f$ is injective. $f$ is surjective. $f$ is bijective. This is really just a counting argument. First, suppose $f$ is injective. If $S$ has $n$ elements, by our assumption, this means the image of $f$ has at least $n$ elements. But the image of $f$ is contained in $S$, so it has at most $n$ elements; so the image of $f$ contains exactly $n$ elements and is therefore the whole of $S$, i.e. $f$ is surjective. Next, suppose $f$ is surjective. So, for each $y$ in $S$, there is an $x$ in $S$ such that $y = f(x)$; we choose one such $x$ for each $y$ and define a function $g : S \\to S$ so that $g(y) = x$. By construction, $f(g(y)) = y$, so $g$ must be injective, and hence, must be surjective by the above argument. So $g$ is a bijection, and $f$ is a left inverse for $g$. But a left inverse for a bijection is also a right inverse, so this implies $f$ is a bijection, and a fortiori an injection. Notice that the very first part of the argument fails when $S$ is not finite. For example, let us consider the function $f : \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}$ defined by $f(x) = x + 1$. This function is certainly injective but is not surjective. Similarly, the function $g : \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}$ defined by $f(0) = 0$ and $f(x + 1) = x$ is surjective, but not injective.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original problem is about proving that a surjective function on a finite set is injective and vice versa. \n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions. The problem mentions that S is a finite set, and f is a surjective function from S to S. The task is to prove injectivity. Wait, the example provided in the original query had assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. So in this case, the assumptions are:\n\n1. S is a finite set.\n2. f is a function from S to S (so the domain and codomain are both S).\n3. f is surjective.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The problem then is to prove that f is injective. \n\nWait, but the original question also mentions \"and conversely,\" which suggests the converse should be part of the problem too. However, the user's example only included one direction. Let me check the original problem again. The title says \"Surjectivity implies injectivity... and conversely,\" so the problem is bidirectional. But the actual question in the body only asks about proving surjectivity implies injectivity. Hmm. Maybe the user wants to split this into two separate problems? But the original question is phrased as a single problem. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to show that for a function f: S → S where S is finite, f is surjective if and only if it is injective. So the problem as stated in the question is to prove one direction (surjective implies injective), but the title mentions the converse. The user might need to structure both directions, but the actual question body only asks about surjective implying injective. \n\nBut according to the user's example, they filtered unrelated info. The original problem's title mentions the converse, but the question body only asks about surjective implying injective. So perhaps the converse is part of the problem? Or maybe the user wants to structure the problem as stated in the body. \n\nThe body of the question says: \"Let S be a finite set. Let f be a surjective function from S to S. How do I prove that it is injective?\" So the problem here is only one direction: surjective implies injective. The converse, injective implies surjective for finite sets, is another part, but the question as posed here is only about surjective => injective. \n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- S is a finite set.\n- f is a function from S to S.\n- f is surjective.\n\nProblem: Prove that f is injective.\n\nBut wait, the example given by the user had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, no. Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like a mistake. Wait, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem in the example lists assumptions as n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But that's incorrect because the original problem didn't require n to be divisible by 7. So perhaps the example is wrong. But the user provided that example, so maybe they made a mistake, but I need to follow their format regardless.\n\nBut in our current problem, the original question says \"Let S be a finite set. Let f be a surjective function from S to S. Prove that it is injective.\" So the assumptions are S is finite, f is a function from S to S, and f is surjective. Then the problem is to prove f is injective. So each assumption is one line. So the user's example might have had an error, but we need to follow the structure regardless. Therefore, the answer should list each assumption separately, each on its own line, addressing one property. So S is finite, function f: S→S, and f is surjective. Then the problem is to prove injectivity.\n\nI think that's correct. The user's example might have included an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem, but perhaps that's part of their process. But in this case, we need to stick to the actual problem given. Therefore, the formatted problem should have the three assumptions listed and the problem statement as proving injectivity.",
