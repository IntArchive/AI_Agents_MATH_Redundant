    "Content": "How to prove that factors of homogeneous polynomial are homogeneous? I was thinking that for a homogeneous polynomial of degree $n$ , $f(ax_1,....,ax_n)=a^nf(x_1,....,x_n)$ where $a\\in k$ Now if $f=f_1...f_r$ and atleast one $f_i$ is not homogeneous then we'll not get $a^n$ but one flaw in this arguement is that this might possible that one $f_i$ and another $f_j$ both non-homogeneous give rise to a homogeneous polynomial so how to fix this problem?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This problem is easier if we use another formulation of $f$ being a homogeneous polynomial. First I'll prove the following fact: a polynomial is homogeneous (in your definition) if and only if each monomial appearing in $f$ has total degree $n$. Proof: First suppose that $f$ is homogeneous. Write $f$ as a sum of monomials $f_i$ of total degree $i$: $f=f_0+f_1 + \\ldots+f_r$. Then \n$$\na^nf(x) = f(ax)=f_0(ax)+f_1(ax)+\\ldots+f_r(ax)=f_0+af_1(x)+\\ldots+a^rf_r(x).\n$$\nWe want to prove that $n=r$ and that $f_r$ is the only term in $f$. For the first fact, note that both sides of the equations are polynomials in $a$. The left hand side has degree $n$ and the right hand side has degree $r$. Hence $n=r$. If we put $a=0$, we see that $f_0=0$. Now differentiate with respect to $a$ to get\n$$\nna^{n-1}f(x) = f_1(x)+2af_2(x) + \\ldots + ra^{r-1}f_r(x).\n$$\nPut $a=0$. Then we see that $f_1=0$. Continue, to conclude that $f(x)=f_r(x)$. Hence we have shown that a homogeneous polynomial must consist of a sum of monomials of total degree $n$. The other direction is easy and is left to the reader. -- Now for your question. We want to see that the factors of a homogeneous polynomial are themselves homogeneous. We do this for two factors, since the general case follows by induction. So suppose that $f=gh$, where $f$ is homogeneous, but one of $g,h$ is not. So suppose $g$ is not homogeneous. By the above, this means that we can write $g=g_{ih}+g_h$, where $g_{h}$ is $g$'s highest degree term, and $g_{ih}$ is its \"inhomogeneous component\" (=the rest). We have\n$$\nf=gh=(g_{ih}+g_h)h=g_{ih}h+g_hh.\n$$\nFor degree reasons (the first term on the right hand side has degree less than $f$, which consist of only top degree monomials), we must have $g_{gih}h=0$, but $g_{ih}$ was nonzero, so $h=0$, but this is absurd.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to structure this problem properly. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format with assumptions and the problem statement. Let me read through the original question again carefully.\n\nThe title is \"How to prove that factors of homogeneous polynomial are homogeneous?\" Then the question body elaborates: The user is thinking that for a homogeneous polynomial of degree n, scaling each variable by a factor a results in the polynomial being scaled by a^n. They mention an argument that if the polynomial factors into f1...fr and at least one fi is not homogeneous, then the product wouldn't maintain the homogeneity. But they point out a flaw: maybe non-homogeneous factors could multiply to give a homogeneous polynomial. So they're asking how to fix that argument or approach.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem is about homogeneous polynomials and their factors. The key points here are:\n\n1. The polynomial in question is homogeneous. So the first assumption is that f is a homogeneous polynomial of degree n.\n2. The polynomial is factored into f1...fr. So another assumption is that f factors into f1, f2, ..., fr.\n3. The user is trying to prove that each factor fi must be homogeneous. So the problem is to show that all factors are homogeneous.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user is asking how to prove that the factors of a homogeneous polynomial are themselves homogeneous. The user's attempted argument has a flaw they want to fix. So the problem statement should be \"Prove that if a homogeneous polynomial factors into polynomials, then each factor must be homogeneous.\"\n\nNow, in terms of assumptions, we need to list each condition. Let me see:\n\nAssumption 1: f is a homogeneous polynomial of degree n. (This is given.)\n\nAssumption 2: f is factored into a product of polynomials f1, f2, ..., fr. (So f = f1*f2*...*fr.)\n\nBut wait, do we need to specify anything about the field? The original question mentions \"where a ∈ k\", so maybe the polynomials are over a field k. However, the problem as stated doesn't specify any restrictions on the field, so maybe the assumption is that all polynomials are over a field k. But the user hasn't mentioned any specific conditions on k, like characteristic zero or algebraically closed. So perhaps we can just note that the polynomials are over a field, but since the user didn't specify, maybe it's unnecessary. However, in the example provided, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the key assumptions are that f is homogeneous and factors into polynomials, and the problem is to prove each factor is homogeneous. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- f is a homogeneous polynomial of degree n.\n- f factors into a product of polynomials f1, f2, ..., fr.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user is asking to prove that the factors are homogeneous. So maybe the assumptions are those two points. But in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the problem's conditions. Here, the problem doesn't have extra conditions beyond the polynomial being homogeneous and factoring into polynomials. So the assumptions should list the given conditions: that f is homogeneous of degree n and that it factors into a product of polynomials. Each assumption should be one line, each addressing one property of one object.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a homogeneous polynomial of degree n,\nf factors into polynomials f₁, f₂, ..., f_r.\n\nProblem:\nProve that each factor f_i is homogeneous.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user's own argument had a flaw. The question is, how to fix the argument. But the problem as posed is \"How to prove that factors of homogeneous polynomial are homogeneous?\" So the formatted problem should be to prove that the factors are homogeneous given that f is homogeneous and factors into polynomials.\n\nIn the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, but in the formatted version, the assumption was listed as n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But the original problem didn't state that n must be divisible by 7; the user might have had a mistake there. Wait, the example's original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted problem added the assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, maybe that example was a mistake. But the user provided that example, so maybe they intended that. However, perhaps in the current problem, we need to be careful not to add assumptions that aren't there.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question is about proving that factors of a homogeneous polynomial are homogeneous. There's no extra conditions given, except that the polynomial is homogeneous and factors into polynomials. So the assumptions should be:\n\n- f is a homogeneous polynomial of degree n.\n- f factors into a product of polynomials f₁f₂…f_r.\n\nProblem: Prove that each factor f_i is homogeneous.\n\nBut the user's question also mentions their attempted argument where they consider f(ax₁,...,ax_n) = a^n f(x₁,...,x_n), and if any f_i is not homogeneous, then the product wouldn't be homogeneous. But they note a flaw: maybe some non-homogeneous factors could combine to a homogeneous product. So the actual problem is to show that this can't happen; that is, in order for the product to be homogeneous, each factor must be homogeneous. Therefore, the problem is indeed to prove that each factor is homogeneous under the given assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have the two assumptions and the problem statement as proving each factor is homogeneous.",
