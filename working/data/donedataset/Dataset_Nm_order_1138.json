    "AcceptedAnswer": "We'll start with a weak estimate, and then use the functional equation to improve it iteratively. Claim: There is a constant $d > 0$ such that $ f(x) \\ge x+d$ for all $x \\ge 0$ . Once we have that estimate (see below for the proof), we can can continue as follows: Setting $C = e^d > 1$ we get $$\nf(x) = f(e^{\\ln x}) = e^{f(\\ln x)} \\ge e^{\\ln x + d} = xe^d = Cx\n$$ for $x \\ge 1$ , then $$\nf(x) = e^{f(\\ln x)} \\ge e^{C\\ln x} = x^C\n$$ for $x \\ge e$ , and finally $$\nf(x) = e^{f(\\ln x)} \\ge e^{(\\ln x)^C} \n$$ for $x \\ge e^e$ . It follows that $$\n\\frac{f(e^x)}{e^{nx}} \\ge \\frac{e^{x^C}}{e^{nx}} = e^{x^C-nx} \\ge x^C-nx+1\n$$ and therefore $$\n \\lim_{y \\to \\infty} \\frac{f(y)}{y^n} = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{f(e^x)}{e^{nx}} = +\\infty \\, .\n$$ Proof of the claim: $f(0) > 0$ and $f$ has no fixed points (see for example thoughts about $f(f(x))=e^x$ ), therefore $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\Bbb R$ . Then $$\n d = \\min \\{ f(x) - x \\mid 0 \\le x \\le 1 \\}\n$$ is strictly positive. Define the sequence $(E_k)$ recursively by $E_0 = 0$ , $E_{k+1} = e^{E_k}$ : $$\n 0, 1, e, e^e, e^{e^e},\\ldots\n$$ $f(x) \\ge x+d$ holds for $E_0 \\le x \\le E_1$ , and if it holds for $E_k \\le x \\le E_{k+1}$ then $$\n f(x) =  e^{f(\\ln x)} \\ge e^{\\ln x + d} = xe^d \\\\\n \\ge x(1+d) = x + xd \\ge x+d\n$$ for $E_{k+1} \\le x \\le E_{k+2}$ .

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the problem is about a continuous function f from the real numbers to the real numbers such that f(f(x)) equals e^x for all x. We need to show that the limit of f(x) divided by x^n as x approaches infinity is infinity for any natural number n. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the given conditions. The function f is continuous and satisfies f(f(x)) = e^x. From the edits mentioned, it seems the user has already established that f is injective and increasing. Let me verify that. Since f is continuous and injective (if it's injective on the reals, which is a connected space, then by the intermediate value theorem, it must be strictly monotonic). So, they argue that if f increases anywhere, it has to be increasing everywhere. Then, in Edit 2, they show that f(1) = e^{f(0)}, which is greater than f(0), implying that f is increasing. That makes sense because if f were decreasing, applying it twice would reverse the order, but here f(f(x)) is e^x, which is increasing. So f must be increasing.\n\nSo the key points are: f is continuous, strictly increasing, and f(f(x)) = e^x. We need to show that f(x) grows faster than any polynomial as x approaches infinity. That is, for any n in natural numbers, f(x)/x^n tends to infinity.\n\nLet me think about how functions compose here. Since f(f(x)) = e^x, maybe we can express f in terms of the exponential function's iterates. But functional equations can be tricky. Let's see.\n\nFirst, note that f is a kind of \"square root\" function for the exponential function under composition. That is, applying f twice gives e^x. So f is like e^{x/2} composed with some other function? Wait, but e^{x/2} composed with itself is e^{e^{x/2}/2}, which isn't e^x. So maybe f is not simply an exponential function scaled by a factor.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps f grows faster than any exponential function. Wait, but if f(f(x)) = e^x, then if f grows faster than e^x, composing it would lead to something even faster, but here the composition is e^x, which is slower. Hmm, that seems contradictory. Wait, maybe f grows slower than e^x. Let's see. Suppose f(x) grows like some function g(x), then f(f(x)) would be g(g(x)). We need g(g(x)) = e^x. So solving for g such that g(g(x)) = e^x. Such functions are called functional square roots of the exponential function. I remember that these can be constructed but are not unique unless certain conditions are imposed. However, in this problem, continuity is given, which might enforce uniqueness.\n\nBut regardless of the exact form, we need to show that f(x) outpaces any polynomial. Let's consider the behavior as x approaches infinity. Let me think about the growth rate. Suppose that as x becomes very large, f(x) behaves like some function. Let's assume f(x) grows faster than any polynomial. If that's the case, then f(x)/x^n would indeed go to infinity. But how do we establish this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find asymptotic estimates for f(x). Let me consider that f(f(x)) = e^x. Let's denote y = f(x). Then f(y) = e^x. So if we have x approaching infinity, then y = f(x) must also approach infinity, because f is increasing and continuous, so bijective from R to R. Thus, as x approaches infinity, y = f(x) approaches infinity, and then f(y) = e^x also approaches infinity. \n\nSo, substituting back, as x approaches infinity, f(f(x)) = e^x. Let's denote x as very large. Then f(x) is very large, and f(f(x)) is e^x. Let me try to relate the growth of f(x) to e^x. Suppose that f(x) grows like some function slower than e^x. For example, if f(x) were logarithmic, then f(f(x)) would be even more logarithmic, which is not e^x. If f(x) were a polynomial, then f(f(x)) would be a polynomial of higher degree, but e^x is not a polynomial. So f(x) can't be a polynomial. Similarly, if f(x) were exponential, say f(x) = e^{kx}, then f(f(x)) = e^{k e^{kx}}, which is way faster than e^x. So that's too fast. Therefore, f(x) must grow slower than an exponential function but faster than any polynomial. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe f(x) grows like a fractional exponential. For instance, if we suppose that f(x) = e^{x/k}, then f(f(x)) = e^{e^{x/k}/k}. If we set this equal to e^x, then we need e^{x/k}/k = x. But e^{x/k} grows exponentially, while x is linear. So that equation can't hold for all x. Therefore, such a simple form won't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe f(x) is related to the Lambert W function or some other special function. But since this is an Olympiad problem, perhaps there's a more elementary approach.\n\nLet's think about the asymptotic behavior. Suppose that as x becomes very large, f(x) is approximately some function g(x), and then f(g(x)) ≈ e^x. If we can find an asymptotic relation between g(x) and e^x, we might get somewhere.\n\nSuppose that f(x) ≈ h(x) as x → ∞, then f(h(x)) ≈ e^x. So, h(h(x)) ≈ e^x. Therefore, h is a function whose composition with itself is approximately e^x. So, solving h(h(x)) ≈ e^x for h(x). Such functions h are known to grow slower than e^x but faster than any polynomial. For example, if we take h(x) = e^{x/2}, then h(h(x)) = e^{e^{x/2}/2}, which is much larger than e^x. So that's too fast. If we take h(x) = sqrt(e^x), which is e^{x/2}, same as before. Hmm, no. Alternatively, perhaps h(x) = log(e^x) = x, but then h(h(x)) = x, which is not e^x. So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, consider iterated logarithms. If h(x) is log x, then h(h(x)) = log log x, which is way too slow. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe if h(x) is such that h(x) is roughly log(e^x) but in a way that when composed, it gives e^x. Wait, if h(x) = e^{x/k}, then h(h(x)) = e^{e^{x/k}/k}. To make this equal to e^x, we need e^{x/k}/k = x. Taking logarithm, x/k - ln k = ln x. So x/k = ln x + ln k. For large x, this would require x/k ≈ ln x, which is impossible because ln x grows slower than x. So even if k is large, x/k would still outgrow ln x. Hence, this approach doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps h(x) is related to the inverse function of e^x. But the inverse of e^x is ln x. But h(h(x)) = e^x would require h(x) = ln(e^x) = x, which again is not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe h(x) is a tower function. For example, h(x) = e^{x/e}, then h(h(x)) = e^{e^{x/e}/e} = e^{(e^{x/e})/e}. Not sure if that helps. It still grows too fast.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps f(x) grows like e^{x/2} multiplied by some slower function. Wait, but that seems vague. Maybe we need to approach this differently.\n\nLet's think about the functional equation f(f(x)) = e^x. Since f is continuous and strictly increasing, it's bijective. Therefore, f has an inverse function. Let's denote f^{-1}(x) as the inverse of f. Then, applying f^{-1} to both sides of the equation f(f(x)) = e^x, we get f(x) = f^{-1}(e^x). Similarly, applying f^{-1} again, x = f^{-1}(f^{-1}(e^x)). So f^{-1}(f^{-1}(e^x)) = x. Let me see if this helps. Maybe not directly.\n\nAlternatively, consider that since f is strictly increasing and bijective, for large x, f(x) must also be large. So, as x tends to infinity, f(x) tends to infinity. Then, f(f(x)) = e^x. Let's denote y = f(x). Then f(y) = e^x. But since y = f(x), and x = f^{-1}(y), so f(y) = e^{f^{-1}(y)}. Let me rearrange this equation: f(y) = e^{f^{-1}(y)}. Taking logarithm on both sides, ln f(y) = f^{-1}(y). Then, applying f to both sides, f(ln f(y)) = y. Hmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, consider the asymptotic behavior. Let's assume that for large y, f^{-1}(y) is approximately some function. Let's say that as y → ∞, f^{-1}(y) ≈ g(y). Then, from the equation ln f(y) = f^{-1}(y), we have ln f(y) ≈ g(y). But since f^{-1}(y) = g(y), then f(g(y)) = y. Therefore, combining with the previous equation, ln f(y) ≈ g(y) = f^{-1}(y). Therefore, f(g(y)) = y and g(y) = ln f(y). Let me substitute g(y) from the second equation into the first: f(ln f(y)) = y. Hmm, this seems a bit circular.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to find an asymptotic expansion for f(x). Suppose that as x becomes very large, f(x) behaves like some function. Let me assume that f(x) is roughly of the form e^{k x} for some k, but as we saw earlier, this doesn't work because composing two exponentials gives a double exponential. Alternatively, maybe f(x) is something like sqrt(e^x). Wait, sqrt(e^x) is e^{x/2}, and composing that gives e^{x/2}/2, which is not e^x. So that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps f(x) grows like e^{x/2}, but then f(f(x)) would be e^{e^{x/2}/2}, which is way too fast. So that's not working. Maybe instead of exponential, f(x) grows like x^k for some k. Then f(f(x)) would be (x^k)^k = x^{k^2}, but we need this to be e^x, which is impossible. So f cannot be a polynomial. Therefore, f(x) must grow faster than any polynomial. But the problem asks to show that f(x)/x^n tends to infinity, which is precisely that f(x) grows faster than any polynomial. So perhaps the key is to show that f(x) cannot be bounded by a polynomial, hence its growth must be super-polynomial.\n\nHow can we establish that? Let's suppose, for contradiction, that there exists some natural number n and some constant C such that f(x) ≤ C x^n for sufficiently large x. Then, f(f(x)) ≤ C (f(x))^n ≤ C (C x^n)^n = C^{n+1} x^{n^2}. But f(f(x)) is e^x, which grows exponentially. However, C^{n+1} x^{n^2} grows polynomially, which is much slower than e^x. This is a contradiction. Therefore, our assumption that f(x) is bounded by a polynomial must be false. Hence, for every natural number n, f(x)/x^n tends to infinity as x approaches infinity.\n\nWait, that seems like a valid argument. Let me write it out more carefully.\n\nAssume, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists an n ∈ ℕ and a constant C > 0 such that for all x sufficiently large, f(x) ≤ C x^n. Then, applying f to both sides, since f is increasing, we have f(f(x)) ≤ f(C x^n). But f(f(x)) = e^x, so e^x ≤ f(C x^n). But since C x^n is just another polynomial, applying the same assumption, f(C x^n) ≤ C (C x^n)^n = C^{n+1} x^{n^2}. Therefore, combining these inequalities, e^x ≤ C^{n+1} x^{n^2} for sufficiently large x. However, the left-hand side grows exponentially, while the right-hand side grows polynomially. This is a contradiction because exponential functions grow faster than any polynomial. Therefore, our initial assumption must be false, which means that for every n ∈ ℕ and every constant C > 0, there exists x sufficiently large such that f(x) > C x^n. Hence, the limit of f(x)/x^n as x approaches infinity must be infinity.\n\nThat seems to be a solid argument. Therefore, the key idea is that if f(x) were bounded by a polynomial, then f(f(x)) would also be bounded by a polynomial, but since f(f(x)) is e^x, which is not polynomially bounded, this leads to a contradiction. Therefore, f(x) must grow faster than any polynomial, hence the limit is infinity.\n\nSo, to structure the problem, the assumptions are:\n\n1. f is a continuous function from ℝ to ℝ.\n2. f(f(x)) = e^x for all x ∈ ℝ.\n3. n is a natural number.\n\nThe problem is to show that the limit of f(x)/x^n as x approaches infinity is infinity.\n\nBut wait, in the original problem, the user already deduced that f is increasing. However, in the problem statement as given, we are told f is continuous and satisfies f(f(x)) = e^x. The user's edits show that f is injective and increasing. So perhaps those are necessary steps in the solution, but when structuring the problem, the assumptions should include only what is given, not what is deduced. Wait, in the example provided, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", and in the formatted problem, the assumption included \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". So in that case, the assumption listed a condition that was present in the problem statement. However, in the current problem, the problem statement says \"Given f: ℝ→ℝ continuous with f(f(x))=e^x for all x∈ℝ. Show that...\" So the assumptions are the continuity of f, the functional equation, and the fact that n is a natural number. The fact that f is increasing is deduced from the given conditions, so it's not part of the problem's assumptions but part of the solution. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumptions should be:\n\n- f is continuous,\n- f(f(x)) = e^x for all real x,\n- n is a natural number.\n\nProblem: Show that lim_{x→∞} f(x)/x^n = ∞.\n\nBut looking back at the example, the original problem mentioned \"for every integer n\", and the formatted problem included \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". Wait, in the example, the user might have modified the problem, perhaps adding the divisibility by 7, but in the original problem, it's \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem includes \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". Wait, that example might be a different problem. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the example given by the user:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1 ) -6^n(3^n +2^n ) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, so in the original problem, it's for every integer n, but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. So it seems the user is modifying the problem, perhaps filtering out unrelated information. Wait, maybe in the original problem, the user made a mistake and included an extra condition. But according to the instructions, when structuring the problem, we need to list all the assumptions from the problem, each as a separate line. So in the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- f: ℝ→ℝ is continuous,\n- f(f(x)) = e^x for all x ∈ ℝ,\n- n ∈ ℕ.\n\nProblem: Show that lim_{x→∞} f(x)/x^n = ∞.\n\nThe fact that f is injective or increasing is not given in the problem statement but deduced from the given assumptions, so they are part of the solution, not the problem's assumptions. Therefore, in the formatted problem, we should only include the assumptions explicitly given in the problem statement.\n\nSo the final formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is continuous,\nf(f(x)) = e^x for all real numbers x,\nn is a natural number.\n\nProblem: Show that $$\\lim_{x\\to \\infty } \\frac{f(x)}{x^n}=\\infty$$.",
