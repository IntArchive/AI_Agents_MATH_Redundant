    "Content": "A Vandermonde-matrix is a matrix of this form: $$\\begin{pmatrix}\n x_0^0 & \\cdots & x_0^n \\\\\n\\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n x_n^0 & \\cdots & x_n^n\n\\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(n+1) \\times (n+1)}$$ . condition ☀ : $\\forall i, j\\in \\{0, \\dots, n\\}: i\\neq j \\Rightarrow x_i \\neq x_j$ Why are Vandermonde-matrices with ☀ always invertible? I have tried to find a short argument for that. I know some ways to show that in principle: rank is equal to dimension all lines / rows are linear independence determinant is not zero find inverse According to proofwiki , the determinant is $$\\displaystyle V_n = \\prod_{1 \\le i < j \\le n} \\left({x_j - x_i}\\right)$$ There are two proofs for this determinant, but I've wondered if there is a simpler way to show that such matrices are invertible.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This is not entirely dissimilar to the answer already posted by Chris Godsil , but I'll post this anyway, maybe it can provide slightly different angle for someone trying to understand this. We want to show that the matrix $$\\begin{pmatrix}\n x_0^0 & \\cdots & x_0^n \\\\\n\\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n x_n^0 & \\cdots & x_n^n\n\\end{pmatrix}$$ is invertible. It suffices to show that the rows columns of this matrix are linearly independent. So let us assume that $c_0v_0+c_1v_1+\\dots+c_nv_n=\\vec 0=(0,0,\\dots,0)$ , where $v_j=(x_0^j,x_1^j,\\dots,x_n^j)$ is the $j$ -the row column written as a vector and $c_0,\\dots,c_n\\in\\mathbb R$ . Then we get on the $k$ -th coordinate (for $k=0,1,\\dots,n$ ) $$c_0+c_1x_k+c_2x_k^2+\\dots+c_nx_k^n=0,$$ which means that $x_k$ is a root of the polynomial $p(x)=c_0+c_1x+c_2x^2+\\dots+c_nx^n$ . Now if the polynomial $p(x)$ of degree at most $n$ has $(n+1)$ different roots $x_0,x_1,\\dots,x_n$ , it must be the zero polynomial and we get that $c_0=c_1=\\dots=c_n=0$ . This proves that the vectors $v_0,v_1,\\dots,v_n$ are linearly independent. (And, in turn, we get that the given matrix is invertible.)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to format this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. Let me start by reading through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe title is \"Why are Vandermonde matrices invertible?\" The user defines a Vandermonde matrix as a matrix with entries x_i^j where i and j range from 0 to n, forming an (n+1)x(n+1) matrix. The key condition mentioned is that for all i and j in {0,...,n}, if i ≠ j then x_i ≠ x_j. The user wants to know why such Vandermonde matrices are always invertible under this condition and is looking for a simpler argument than the determinant proof.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that the matrix is a Vandermonde matrix, which has a specific form. The condition given (☀) is that all x_i are distinct. So, the assumptions should be:\n\n1. The matrix is a Vandermonde matrix with entries x_i^j for i, j from 0 to n.\n2. All x_i are distinct (i.e., x_i ≠ x_j for i ≠ j).\n\nThese are the two main assumptions. The problem then is to show that such a matrix is invertible. \n\nWait, the original problem's title and question both focus on invertibility given the distinctness of x_i. The user mentions the determinant formula but seeks a simpler proof. However, for structuring the problem, I don't need to include their thoughts on possible methods (like determinant or rank), just the core problem and assumptions.\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\nAssumption: Each line should address one property. So first, the matrix is a Vandermonde matrix as defined. Second, all x_i are distinct. That's two assumptions.\n\nProblem: Why are Vandermonde matrices with distinct x_i always invertible?\n\nI need to make sure that the problem is phrased correctly. The user's exact problem is \"Why are Vandermonde-matrices with ☀ always invertible?\" where ☀ is the distinct x_i condition. So the problem is to prove that under the condition that all x_i are distinct, the Vandermonde matrix is invertible.\n\nYes, that's the core. The example provided in the user's instruction had assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property. Here, the first assumption is about the structure of the matrix (Vandermonde), and the second is about the distinctness of the nodes x_i. So that's two separate assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nThe matrix is a Vandermonde matrix of the form given (with entries x_i^j),\nAll x_i are distinct (for i ≠ j, x_i ≠ x_j).\n\nProblem: Prove that the Vandermonde matrix is invertible.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement in the example included the specific expression for A(n). In this case, the problem is to show invertibility, so the problem line should state that.\n\nSo the final answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nThe matrix is a Vandermonde matrix of the form $$\\begin{pmatrix} x_0^0 & \\cdots & x_0^n \\\\ \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ x_n^0 & \\cdots & x_n^n \\end{pmatrix}$$,\nAll $x_i$ are distinct (i.e., $x_i \\neq x_j$ for $i \\neq j$).\nProblem: \nProve that the Vandermonde matrix is invertible.\n###END_OF_FORMAT###\n\nI need to check if each assumption is one line and addresses one property. The first line defines the matrix structure, the second line the distinctness. The problem is to prove invertibility. That matches the example's structure. The user's original question included the matrix definition and the distinctness condition, so that's covered. The problem is correctly stated as proving invertibility. I think this is correct.",
