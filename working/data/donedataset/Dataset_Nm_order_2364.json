    "Content": "I understand that the integral of any function from and to the same point must equal zero, such;\n$$\\int_a^a f(x) \\,dx= 0$$\nIt makes sense, area from one point to the same point should be zero. But, how is this shown in a mathematical sense, proving it fully, without just saying 'it makes sense'?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Consider the definition of Riemann Sum on $[a,b]$ $$\n\\sum_{k=1}^n f(x_j^\\ast)(x_j-x_{j-1})\n$$ where $a=x_0 \\leqslant x_1 \\leqslant \\dots \\leqslant x_{n-1} \\leqslant x_n=b$ is a subdivision of $[a,b]$ and $x^\\ast_j\\in [x_{j-1},x_j]$, $j=1,\\dots,n$, are sample points. Then, if $a=b$, we clearly have $a=x_0=x_1=\\dots=x_n=b$, so any Riemann Sum is trivially $0$. It converges to $0$, so $\\int_a^b f(x)\\; dx=0$. Note : As noted in @Eric Schmidt's answer, this depends a lot on your choice of definition. In the explanation above, I assumed that points in a subdivision could be equal, which is certainly not universal. If you assume that they have to be different (strict inequality $<$ instead of large ones $\\leqslant$), then you cannot define $\\int_a^a f(x)\\; dx$ at all, since the Riemann Sum itself, hence its convergence, would not be defined.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let's start by looking at the example provided. The user wants the assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then the problem statement itself.\n\nThe original question is about proving that the integral from a point 'a' to the same point 'a' of a function f(x) dx equals zero. The user wants this proven rigorously, not just by intuitive reasoning about area.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions. The example had assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". In this case, what are the assumptions?\n\nThe integral ∫ₐᵃ f(x) dx = 0. To prove this, we might rely on the definition of integrals. So the assumptions would involve the properties of the integral and the function involved.\n\nPossible assumptions:\n1. The function f is integrable on the interval [a, a]. Wait, but an interval from a to a is just a single point. Integrable on a single point? Hmm. Maybe more accurately, that f is integrable on some interval containing a, but the integral from a to a is defined regardless. Alternatively, maybe the assumption is that f is a function for which the integral is defined. Since the integral from a to a is always zero by definition in Riemann integrals, but maybe the problem is to prove it from more fundamental principles.\n\nWait, the question says \"how is this shown in a mathematical sense, proving it fully\". So the user wants a proof starting from definitions. So perhaps the assumptions would involve the definition of the integral. Let's think.\n\nIn Riemann integrals, the integral from a to a is defined as zero. But maybe in the context of the problem, they want to show this using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Alternatively, starting from the definition of the integral as the limit of Riemann sums.\n\nIf we take the Riemann sum approach, when the interval [a, a] has zero width, so the Riemann sum would be f(a) * 0, which is zero. Hence the integral is zero. But maybe the problem is to formalize this.\n\nSo assumptions needed here. Let's see:\n\n1. The function f is defined at the point a.\n2. The integral is considered in the Riemann sense. (Assuming the integral is Riemann, but maybe it's general.)\n\nWait, perhaps the key assumption is that f is integrable on [a, a]. But technically, any function is integrable on a singleton interval, and the integral is zero. So maybe the assumption is just that f is a function for which the integral is defined. However, since the interval has zero length, the integral is zero regardless.\n\nBut to structure the problem as per the example, the assumptions should list each condition. Since the example had two assumptions for the number theory problem, maybe here the assumption is that f is integrable on [a, a], which might be trivial, but perhaps necessary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a need to specify the integral is a definite integral in the Riemann sense. But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\n- f is a function for which the integral ∫ₐᵃ f(x) dx is defined.\n\nBut maybe that's redundant. Alternatively, if using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, then perhaps assuming f is continuous and F is an antiderivative. But the question doesn't specify using FTC. So maybe the assumptions should be more about the properties of the integral itself.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has no specific assumptions beyond the integral being defined, but in the example given, the user included \"n is an integer\" even though the problem statement already said \"for every integer n\". So perhaps here, the assumption is that a is a real number and f is a function integrable on [a, a]. But since [a, a] is a single point, integrability is trivial.\n\nWait, maybe the key here is that the integral is over an interval of zero length, so the assumption is that the integral from a to a is defined, which it always is, and equals zero. But perhaps to structure the problem, the assumption is just that a is a real number and f is integrable on [a, a], but that's a bit too pedantic. However, following the example, the user might list each condition. Let me check the example again:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example is wrong? Wait, no. Wait, in the original problem, the user had to structure the problem with assumptions. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they list \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But that contradicts. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an extra condition that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Unless the example was a different problem. Wait, maybe the original problem had a typo or the example was from another problem.\n\nBut perhaps the example was a different case where the original problem had n being an integer but the answer required n divisible by 7. But regardless, the point is that in the formatted problem, the assumptions list each condition. So perhaps in this integral problem, the key assumptions are:\n\n- a is a real number.\n- f is a function defined at x = a.\n- The integral ∫ₐᵃ f(x) dx is considered in the Riemann sense.\n\nBut maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, the problem might not need specific assumptions beyond what's given. The original problem states: \"the integral from a to a of f(x) dx equals zero\". The user wants to prove this. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- Let a be a real number.\n- Let f be a function integrable on the interval [a, a].\n\nBut [a, a] is a single point, so integrable there trivially, and the integral is zero. But to prove this, perhaps the key is to refer to the definition of the integral.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to show this using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. If F is an antiderivative of f, then ∫ₐᵃ f(x) dx = F(a) - F(a) = 0. So in that case, the assumption would be that f is continuous on [a, a] and F is its antiderivative. But continuity at a point is trivial.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify using FTC. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the definition of the integral as the limit of Riemann sums. In that case, the integral from a to a would involve a single interval with width zero, so the Riemann sum is zero, hence the limit is zero.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- f is a function defined at x = a.\n- The integral is defined as the limit of Riemann sums.\n\nBut how to phrase this concisely. Following the example's structure, each assumption is a single line, one property per line.\n\nSo possible assumptions:\n\n1. a is a real number.\n2. f is a real-valued function defined at x = a.\n3. The integral ∫ₐᵃ f(x) dx is considered in the Riemann sense.\n\nBut maybe the key is that the integral from a to a is over an interval of length zero, hence the integral is zero. Therefore, the assumptions might be:\n\n1. The interval of integration [a, a] has length zero.\n2. f is a function for which the integral over [a, a] is defined.\n\nBut perhaps the problem assumes standard Riemann integrals, so the main assumption is that f is integrable on [a, a], which is always true because the interval is trivial. So in the formatted problem:\n\nAssumption:\nThe function f is integrable on the interval [a, a].\n\nProblem:\nProve that ∫ₐᵃ f(x) dx = 0.\n\nBut maybe that's sufficient. Alternatively, the problem could have no assumptions besides a being a real number and f being a function. But in the example, they split the assumptions into lines, each with one condition. So here, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\na is a real number,\nf is a real-valued function defined at x = a,\nthe integral is a Riemann integral.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ∫ₐᵃ f(x) dx = 0.\n\nBut maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, since the integral from a to a is always zero by definition, but the user wants a proof. So maybe the assumption is that the integral is defined in the standard Riemann sense, and the problem is to prove the statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key is to use the additivity property of integrals: ∫ₐᵇ f(x) dx + ∫_b^c f(x) dx = ∫ₐ^c f(x) dx. If we set b = a and c = a, then ∫ₐᵃ f(x) dx + ∫ₐ^a f(x) dx = ∫ₐ^a f(x) dx, which implies that ∫ₐᵃ f(x) dx = 0. But this is more of a property.\n\nAlternatively, starting from the definition: the integral from a to a is the limit as n approaches infinity of the Riemann sum with partition points a = x_0 < x_1 < ... < x_n = a. But since all x_i = a, the mesh is zero, and the sum is zero. Hence the limit is zero.\n\nSo the assumptions would be that the integral is defined as the limit of Riemann sums. Therefore, the assumption is that f is Riemann integrable on [a, a], which is always true, and the problem is to compute the integral.\n\nBut given the example, perhaps the answer is structured with minimal assumptions. Let's see the example again:\n\nOriginal example's formatted problem:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem:\nProve that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nBut in the original problem, the user had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. Maybe the example is from a different problem where the divisibility by 7 was an added condition. Perhaps there was a mistake in the example. But regardless, following the user's instruction, for the current problem, I need to extract the assumptions.\n\nThe current problem is to prove ∫ₐᵃ f(x) dx = 0. The assumptions needed here would be:\n\n1. a is a real number.\n2. f is a function defined at x = a.\n3. The integral is considered in the Riemann sense.\n\nBut perhaps the key assumptions are just that the integral is defined. However, in Riemann integrals, the integral over [a, a] is zero by definition. But maybe the problem wants to show this from the definition. So the assumptions would be based on the definition of the integral.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might not need any assumptions beyond the integral being defined, but in the example, they listed assumptions even when the original problem stated them. So perhaps here, the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\na is a real number,\nf is a function integrable on [a, a].\n\nProblem:\nProve that ∫ₐᵃ f(x) dx = 0.\n\nBut integrable on [a, a] is trivial because the interval has measure zero.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the assumption would be that f is continuous on [a, a], which it is, and F is an antiderivative. Then ∫ₐᵃ f(x) dx = F(a) - F(a) = 0.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify the method of proof. So the safest way is to list the necessary assumptions for the integral to be defined. Thus:\n\nAssumption:\na is a real number,\nf is a real-valued function defined at x = a,\nthe integral ∫ₐᵃ f(x) dx is defined as a Riemann integral.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ∫ₐᵃ f(x) dx = 0.\n\nBut maybe that's redundant. Alternatively, just:\n\nAssumption:\nThe function f is integrable on the interval [a, a].\n\nProblem:\nProve that ∫ₐᵃ f(x) dx = 0.\n\nBut given that [a, a] is a single point, integrable is automatically satisfied. However, to make it clear, perhaps the assumptions are minimal. Since the example included two assumptions for the problem, perhaps here:\n\nAssumption:\na is a real number,\nf is a real-valued function.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ∫ₐᵃ f(x) dx = 0.\n\nBut I think the crucial point is that the interval has length zero, so the integral is zero. Therefore, the key assumption is that the integral is over an interval of zero length. But since the integral is from a to a, that's given. So perhaps the assumptions are just:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is taken over the interval [a, a].\n\nProblem:\nProve that ∫ₐᵃ f(x) dx = 0.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions listed properties of the objects (n is an integer, etc.), so here, a is a real number, f is a function. But the problem doesn't state any restrictions on a or f beyond being part of the integral. So likely:\n\nAssumption:\na is a real number,\nf is a function such that the integral ∫ₐᵃ f(x) dx is defined.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ∫ₐᵃ f(x) dx = 0.\n\nI think that's acceptable. Each assumption is a single line, one property. The first line states that a is a real number, the second that f is integrable on [a,a], which is implicitly true but stated for clarity. Then the problem is to prove the integral equals zero.",
