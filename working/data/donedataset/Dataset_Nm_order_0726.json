    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original problem is about proving two statements involving lim sup. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The first part is the inequality: lim sup(a_n b_n) ≤ lim sup a_n * lim sup b_n. The second part says that if lim a_n exists, then lim sup(a_n b_n) = lim sup a_n * lim sup b_n. \n\nLooking at the assumptions, the first statement doesn't have any explicit conditions except that a_n and b_n are sequences. But maybe the user expects implicit assumptions here. For example, the sequences need to be such that the lim sup exists, which usually requires boundedness. However, in standard lim sup properties, the sequences are assumed to be bounded unless specified otherwise. But since the user's example didn't include that, maybe I should check.\n\nWait, in the example given by the user, the assumption was \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So they split each condition into separate lines. For the current problem, the first part doesn't have explicit assumptions beyond the sequences being real numbers. The second part adds the condition that the limit of a_n exists. So for the second problem, the assumption would be that the limit of a_n exists. \n\nSo for the first problem, the assumption is just that a_n and b_n are real sequences. But since the user's example didn't mention that unless necessary, maybe the problem statement is general. However, in the standard lim sup inequality, we might need that the lim sup of a_n and b_n are finite. But perhaps in the problem's context, these are given. Since the user's example didn't include assumptions about the sequences, maybe the problem is stated in general terms without specific conditions. But maybe the key assumption is that the sequences are bounded? Because lim sup is defined for bounded sequences. Wait, actually, lim sup can be defined for any real sequence, but if the sequences are not bounded, then the lim sup could be infinity. However, the inequality might require that the lim sups are finite. But the problem as stated doesn't specify. Hmm. But since the user wants to filter unrelated information, maybe the problem is presented as is, and the assumptions are just what's needed. \n\nWait, the problem as presented on Math Stack Exchange is just the two statements. The user is asking for the problem to be structured with assumptions and the problem. So for the first part, the inequality, the assumption would be that a_n and b_n are real sequences. But maybe the problem assumes that the lim sups exist. But since the user's example only included explicit conditions from the problem, perhaps here the assumption is that a_n and b_n are real sequences. But the problem statement itself is to prove the inequality. So the assumption might just be that a_n and b_n are sequences of real numbers. \n\nThen, the second part: \"if lim a_n exists then...\" So the assumption here is that the limit of a_n exists. \n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nFirst problem: Prove lim sup(a_n b_n) ≤ lim sup a_n * lim sup b_n. Assumptions: a_n is a real sequence, b_n is a real sequence.\n\nSecond problem: Prove that if lim a_n exists, then lim sup(a_n b_n) = lim sup a_n * lim sup b_n. Assumptions: a_n is a real sequence, b_n is a real sequence, the limit of a_n exists.\n\nBut in the example provided by the user, they split each assumption into separate lines. So for the first problem, maybe each sequence is an assumption. Similarly, for the second problem, the existence of the limit is another assumption.\n\nSo structuring it:\n\nFor the first problem:\n\nAssumption:\na_n is a real sequence,\nb_n is a real sequence.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\limsup ( a_n b_n ) \\leq \\limsup a_n \\limsup b_n.$$\n\nFor the second problem:\n\nAssumption:\na_n is a real sequence,\nb_n is a real sequence,\nthe limit of a_n exists.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\limsup ( a_n b_n ) = \\limsup a_n \\limsup b_n.$$\n\nBut the original question on Math SE combines both parts. The user there asks two things: first to prove the inequality, then to prove the equality when lim a_n exists. So in the formatted problem, should both be included as separate problems under the same question? The example given by the user had only one problem, but here there are two. However, the original user instruction says to \"structure that problem as the following format\" where the example has one problem. So maybe split into two separate problems, each with their own assumptions and problem statements.\n\nBut looking at the example, the original problem had two parts but in the formatted version, they combined them into one problem. Wait, no. The original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted assumption lists n as integer and n divisible by 7. Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the example has a mistake? Because in the original problem, the user wrote \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. But maybe the example was a mistake. Because the problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That would restrict the problem, but maybe the example was wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem had a different condition. Hmm, maybe there was a misunderstanding in the example. Because if the problem is to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, then the assumption shouldn't include that n is divisible by 7. Unless 91 is 13*7, so maybe the problem has a condition that n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem, it's stated for every integer n. So maybe the example is incorrect, but the user provided it as their example. So perhaps the user wants to follow that structure even if it's not correct.\n\nBut given that, perhaps for the current problem, the user wants to split into two separate problems. The first is proving the inequality, the second is proving the equality when the limit exists. So each with their own assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, the original problem has two parts: the inequality and the equality under the existence of lim a_n. So in the formatted problem, maybe list both as separate problems under the same problem statement. But the example given by the user has one problem. So perhaps the user wants each part as a separate problem.\n\nAlternatively, present both as parts of the same problem with multiple assumptions. But the example has one problem with multiple assumptions.\n\nGiven the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem lists two assumptions: n is integer, and n divisible by 7, which seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\". But perhaps the example is flawed, but the user still wants to follow that format. Therefore, perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions for the first part are just that a_n and b_n are sequences, and for the second part, adding that the limit of a_n exists.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\na_n is a real sequence,\nb_n is a real sequence.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\limsup ( a_n b_n ) \\leq \\limsup a_n \\limsup b_n.$$\n\nThen, another problem:\n\nAssumption:\na_n is a real sequence,\nb_n is a real sequence,\nthe limit of a_n exists.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\limsup ( a_n b_n ) = \\limsup a_n \\limsup b_n.$$\n\nBut the original question includes both parts in one. So maybe structure them as two separate problems. However, the user's example had one problem. Maybe the user wants to combine them into one problem with multiple parts. But the format example has one problem. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe structure it as two separate assumptions and two separate problems. But the user's example lists assumptions and then the problem. So perhaps for the current problem, the first part has assumptions a_n and b_n are real sequences, and the problem is the inequality. Then the second part has the additional assumption that the limit of a_n exists, and the problem is the equality.\n\nTherefore, the final answer would have two separate formatted problems. But since the original question on Math SE asks both, maybe present them as two separate problems. However, the user's instruction says to structure \"the problem\" as per the format, so maybe each part is a separate problem.\n\nBut given the example, which combined two conditions (n is integer and n divisible by 7) into the assumptions for one problem, perhaps in the current case, the two parts are considered one problem with two parts. However, the example's problem is a single statement, whereas here there are two separate statements. \n\nAlternatively, the user might expect both to be in one problem, but with different assumptions for each part. However, the format requires each problem to have its own assumptions and problem statement.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct approach is to present two separate formatted problems. The first is proving the inequality with assumptions that a_n and b_n are real sequences. The second is proving the equality with the additional assumption that the limit of a_n exists.\n\nBut wait, the original problem statement on Math SE says: \"I also have to prove, if lim a_n exists then: [equality]\". So the second part is conditional on lim a_n existing. Therefore, the second problem's assumptions are a_n and b_n are real sequences, and lim a_n exists. \n\nThus, structuring both parts as separate problems.\n\nTherefore, the formatted output would be:\n\nAssumption:\na_n is a real sequence,\nb_n is a real sequence.\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\limsup ( a_n b_n ) \\leq \\limsup a_n \\limsup b_n.$$\n\nAssumption:\na_n is a real sequence,\nb_n is a real sequence,\nthe limit of a_n exists.\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\limsup ( a_n b_n ) = \\limsup a_n \\limsup b_n.$$\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each assumption is listed line by line, each applying to one object. The first problem's assumptions are the sequences, the second adds the existence of the limit of a_n.",
