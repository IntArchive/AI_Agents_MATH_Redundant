    "Content": "Let $x\\neq0$ be a real number such that $x^5$ and $20x+\\frac {19}x$ are rational. How can we prove that $x$ is also rational? (This was a question from the RMO 2019 in India.) My attempt: Let $a,b,c,d$ be integers such that $20x+\\frac {19}{x}=\\frac ab$ and $x^5 = \\frac{c}{d}$ . Then we have $$x=\\frac{a\\pm\\sqrt{a^2-1520 b^2}}{40b}$$ so $x$ is rational iff $\\sqrt{a^2-1520 b^2}$ is rational. However, I don't know how to prove that $\\sqrt{a^2-1520 b^2}$ is rational using that $$x=\\frac{\\sqrt[5]{c}}{\\sqrt[5]{d}}$$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Given that $20x+\\frac{19}{x}$ is rational. Therefore $x$ satisfies a quadratic polynomial with rational co-efficients. If we call that polynomial as $g$ , we get $g(x)=0$ . Now by the Euclidean algorithm $x^5=h(x)g(x)+f(x)$ , where $f(x)$ is a linear polynomial on $x$ with rational co-efficients. Since $x^5\\in\\mathbb{Q}$ and $g(x)=0$ , we get $f(x)\\in\\mathbb{Q}\\Rightarrow x\\in\\mathbb{Q}$ . [Note by Bill D. $ $ The inference $f(x)\\in\\Bbb Q\\,\\Rightarrow\\, x\\in \\Bbb Q\\,$ fails if $\\,\\deg f < 1,\\,$ so we must prove $\\,\\deg f = 1\\,$ to complete the above argument. One way to remedy that is in Jyrki's answer, and another way is to explicitly compute the remainder $\\,f(x) = r\\, x + s\\,$ then prove $\\,r \\neq 0\\,$ (which is essentially equivalent to the method in the linked official solution - reproduced in Jack's answer)]",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example they provided shows that I need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing only one property or condition applied to one object. Then state the problem clearly.\n\nThe original problem from Math Stack Exchange is: \"Let $x\\neq0$ be a real number such that $x^5$ and $20x+\\frac{19}{x}$ are rational. How can we prove that $x$ is also rational?\" It's from RMO 2019 in India.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that x is a non-zero real number. Then, two conditions: x^5 is rational, and 20x + 19/x is rational. Each of these should be separate assumptions. The problem is to prove x is rational.\n\nLooking at the example, the assumptions were listed as separate lines, each with one condition on one object. Here, the object is x. So:\n\nAssumption 1: x is a real number.\nAssumption 2: x ≠ 0.\nAssumption 3: x⁵ is rational.\nAssumption 4: 20x + 19/x is rational.\n\nThen the problem is to prove x is rational.\n\nWait, but in the original problem statement, x is given as a real number. So the first assumption is x is real and non-zero. But according to the example, each assumption should address only one property. So maybe split into x is real, x ≠0, x⁵ is rational, and 20x +19/x is rational.\n\nYes, that's four separate assumptions. Then the problem is to prove x is rational. That seems correct.\n\nSo the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number,\nx ≠ 0,\nx⁵ is rational,\n20x + (19)/x is rational.\n\nProblem: Prove that x is rational.\n\nI need to check if the problem statement includes all necessary conditions. The original question says \"Let x ≠0 be a real number such that x⁵ and 20x + 19/x are rational. Prove x is rational.\" So breaking that into separate assumptions as per the example's structure. Each condition on x is a separate line. Looks good. The user's example split the n being integer and divisible by 7 into two separate assumptions. Similarly here, x being real, x not zero, x⁵ rational, 20x +19/x rational.\n\nSo the final answer should follow the format with those assumptions and the problem statement.",
