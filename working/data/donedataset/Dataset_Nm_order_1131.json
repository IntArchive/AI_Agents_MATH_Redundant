    "Content": "Any number less than 1 can be expressed in base g as $\\sum _{k=1}^\\infty {\\frac {D_k}{g^k}}$, where $D_k$ is the value of the $k^{th}$ digit. If we were interested in only the non-zero digits of this number, we could equivalently express it as $\\sum _{k=1}^\\infty {\\frac {C_k}{g^{Z(k)}}}$, where $Z(k)$ is the position of the $k^{th}$ non-zero digit base $g$ and $C_k$ is the value of that digit (i.e. $C_k = D_{Z(k)}$). Now, consider all the numbers of this form $(\\sum _{k=1}^\\infty {\\frac {C_k}{g^{Z(k)}}})$ where the function $Z(k)$ eventually dominates any polynomial. Is there a proof that any number of this form is transcendental? So far, I have found a paper demonstrating this result for the case $g=2$; it can be found here .",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The answer to your question is yes. All numbers of the form $x=\\sum_{n\\ge0}\\frac{C_k}{g^{Z(k)}}$ for Z(k) eventually dominating any polynomial are indeed transcendental. As in the question, g and C k are integers with 1 ≤ C k ≤ g-1. In fact, the methods used by the paper linked in the question generalize in a quite straightforward way to handle this situation. I don't know of this result appearing in any published paper, but note the following points. We can say straight-away that x is irrational. This follows from Z(n) eventually dominating any linear function of n, so its base-g expansion is not eventually periodic. If Z(n+1)/Z(n) is unbounded then, as noted in the comments, x will be a Liouville number so, by Liouville's theorem, it is transcendental. For any N > 0, Z(n+1) ≥ NZ(n) for infinitely many n. The fact that it is a Liouville number follows from taking $p=\\sum_{k=1}^nC_kg^{Z(n)-Z(k)}$ and $q=g^{Z(n)}$, giving the rational approximation $|x-p/q|< g^{1+Z(n)-Z(n+1)}\\le gq^{-N}$. By the Thue–Siegel–Roth theorem , if Z(n+1)/Z(n) ≥ 2+ε infinitely often (any ε > 0) then x will be transcendental. The theorem says that an irrational algebraic number has only finitely many rational approximations $\\vert x-p/q\\vert\\le cq^{-2-\\epsilon}$ for any fixed c,ε > 0. That x has infinitely many such rational approximations follows in the same way as for point 2 above. Every Z(n+1) ≥ (2+ε)Z(n) gives a rational approximation $\\vert x-p/q\\vert< gq^{-2-\\epsilon}$, so x cannot be algebraic. This covers the case where Z(n) grows exponentially of rate a n for any a > 2, but is not strong enough to cover cases such as Z(n) = 2 n . If Z(n+1)/Z(n) > 1+ε infinitely often (any ε > 0) then x will be transcendental. This is a consequence of the Roth-Ridout theorem, from the 1957 paper Rational approximations to algebraic numbers (not free access, but is also quoted in the freely available paper An explicit version of the theorem of Roth-Ridout , Theorem 2). The Roth-Ridout theorem strengthens the Thue-Siegel-Roth theorem implying, in particular, for irrational and algebraic x, there are only finitely many rational approximations $\\vert x-p/q\\vert\\le cq^{-1-\\epsilon}$ when the prime factors of q all belong to some fixed finite set P . In our case, we can let P be the set of prime factors of g and the result follows in the same way as for point 3 above. This shows that x is transcendental if Z(n) grows exponentially. (thanks to Mike Bennett over at mathoverflow for pointing out the Roth-Ridout theorem). A paper by Bugeaud, On the b-ary expansion of an algebraic number shows that, if x is irrational and algebraic then for large enough n, there are at least (log n) 1+1/(ω+4) (loglog n) -1/4 nonzero digits among the first n digits of the base g expansion. Here, ω is the the number of prime divisors of g. This shows that, if Z(n) ≥ exp(cn α ) for large n and any fixed c > 0, α > 1/(1+1/(ω+4)) then x is transcendental. After reading through the details of the paper linked in the original question, I note that they do generalize to the base g ≥ 2 case. So x is transcendental as long as Z(n) eventually dominates any polynomial. I don't know of any published paper proving this, but posted my proof on mathoverflow where this question was also asked. I have re-read through this proof a few times to be sure, and am now confident that it is correct (modulo small typos, etc). Also, Bugeaud posted an answer to the question agreeing that the method generalizes. Using #(x,n) to denote the number of non-zero digits in the first n digits of the base g expansion of x, the precise statement is as follows. If x is irrational and satisfies a rational polynomial of degree D then #(x,n) ≥ cn 1/D for a positive constant c and all large enough n. In fact, you can easily remove the \"large enough\" from this statement, although I find it convenient stated in this way. The proof I wrote out is a generalization of the methods used in the paper linked in the question. There is one change worth noting though. Whereas the paper made use of the Thue-Siegel-Roth theorem at one point (Theorem 3.1), I used Liouville's theorem . This means that the constant c appearing in the statement above is not quite as good (if you go through the proof and work it out explicitly) although, in any case, the paper linked in the question could have obtained a better value by using the Roth-Ridout theorem instead. Using Liouville's theorem does have two advantages though. Firstly, it is elementary. A proof of Liouville's theorem is given in the linked Wikipedia article. Secondly, it is effective . That is, not only can the constant c be calculated but you can also work out exactly what \"large enough\" means for n in the statement above (which will depend on the polynomial satisfied by x). The strengthened versions of Liouville's theorem such as Thue-Siegel-Roth and Roth-Ridout are not effective.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me start by reading through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe user is asking about numbers expressed in a certain form where the positions of the non-zero digits (Z(k)) eventually dominate any polynomial. They want to know if there's a proof that all such numbers are transcendental. They mention a paper for the case when the base g=2, but they're asking about the general case for any base g.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. Each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. Let's break down the problem:\n\n1. The number is expressed in base g as a sum of terms where each non-zero digit is represented by C_k divided by g raised to Z(k). So, the number is of the form sum_{k=1}^∞ (C_k / g^{Z(k)}).\n\n2. The function Z(k), which gives the position of the k-th non-zero digit, eventually dominates any polynomial. That means for any polynomial P(k), there exists some K beyond which Z(k) > P(k).\n\n3. The base g is probably an integer greater than 1, since they're talking about digit expansions. The original example uses base 2, but the question is general. However, the user didn't explicitly state that g is an integer >=2. But in standard digit representations, the base is an integer greater than 1. Maybe that's an assumption to include?\n\nWait, the problem statement doesn't explicitly mention that g is an integer base. But in the context of digit expansions, it's standard. However, the user might be considering more general bases. Hmm. But the example given is g=2, which is an integer. So perhaps we need to assume that g is an integer greater than or equal to 2. But the problem as stated doesn't specify that. However, in the original question, the user says \"any number less than 1 can be expressed in base g...\", so base g here is likely an integer >=2. So, maybe the assumption is that g is an integer with g >=2. But the user hasn't specified that in their problem. Wait, the original problem states \"base g\", which usually implies integer >=2, but maybe they are considering other bases. However, the problem as written doesn't explicitly state that g is an integer. So perhaps that's not an assumption here. The problem is stated in terms of base g, so maybe the base is given as a fixed integer >=2. But since the user is asking in general, perhaps the assumptions should include that g is an integer greater than or equal to 2. However, the original problem as presented by the user doesn't specify that. Wait, the user wrote:\n\n\"Any number less than 1 can be expressed in base g as sum..., where D_k is the value of the k-th digit.\"\n\nIn standard digit expansions, base g is an integer >=2, and digits D_k are integers between 0 and g-1. So perhaps the assumptions here are that:\n\n- g is an integer, g >=2.\n\n- Each digit D_k is an integer with 0 <= D_k < g.\n\n- The number is expressed in base g as sum_{k=1}^\\infty D_k/g^k.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user re-expresses the number in terms of non-zero digits, so C_k is the non-zero digit at position Z(k). So C_k would be integers between 1 and g-1.\n\nBut the problem as posed is asking about numbers of the form sum_{k=1}^\\infty C_k/g^{Z(k)} where Z(k) eventually dominates any polynomial.\n\nSo the key assumptions here are:\n\n1. The number is expressed as sum_{k=1}^∞ (C_k / g^{Z(k)}), where C_k is the k-th non-zero digit, and Z(k) is the position of the k-th non-zero digit.\n\n2. The function Z(k) eventually dominates any polynomial. That is, for any polynomial P(k), there exists K such that for all k >= K, Z(k) > P(k).\n\n3. The base g is an integer >=2 (since it's a base in the digit expansion context, though the user didn't explicitly state this, but in mathematical digit expansions, this is standard. So perhaps this is an implicit assumption.)\n\nHowever, the user's original question doesn't state that g is an integer. If we follow strictly what's written, maybe we shouldn't assume that. But without g being an integer >=2, the digit expansion doesn't make much sense. So perhaps we need to include that as an assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is stated for any base g, which could be any real number greater than 1, but digit expansions in non-integer bases are possible. However, in such cases, the digits might not be integers. The original problem mentions \"the value of the k-th digit\", so if in base g, the digits D_k are typically between 0 and floor(g), but if g is not an integer, this might vary. However, the user's example paper uses g=2, which is an integer. So the user is likely considering integer bases. Therefore, including that as an assumption is reasonable.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- g is an integer, g >=2.\n\n- The number is expressed as sum_{k=1}^∞ (C_k / g^{Z(k)}), where each C_k is a non-zero digit in base g (so 1 <= C_k <= g-1).\n\n- The function Z(k) eventually dominates any polynomial; that is, for any polynomial P(k), there exists K such that for all k >= K, Z(k) > P(k).\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"the function Z(k) eventually dominates any polynomial\". So the third assumption is that Z(k) eventually grows faster than any polynomial. So that's one assumption.\n\nSo each bullet point in assumptions should be a single condition applied to one object.\n\nSo breaking down:\n\n1. The number is expressed in base g as sum_{k=1}^∞ (C_k / g^{Z(k)}), where C_k is the value of the k-th non-zero digit and Z(k) is its position.\n\n2. g is an integer greater than or equal to 2.\n\n3. Each C_k is an integer satisfying 1 <= C_k <= g - 1.\n\n4. The function Z(k) eventually dominates any polynomial. (Meaning, for any polynomial P(k), there exists K such that for all k >= K, Z(k) > P(k).)\n\nBut wait, the original problem doesn't explicitly state that g is an integer. The user says \"base g\", which in standard terms implies integer >=2, but perhaps they are considering non-integer bases. However, the example given is g=2, which is an integer. Since the user refers to digits, which in non-integer bases can be more complicated, but the standard digit expansion is with integer bases. So it's safe to assume that g is an integer >=2. But since the user didn't specify, should I include that as an assumption? Or is that part of the problem's context?\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be considering any base g >1, integer or not. But digits in non-integer bases can still be defined, though the digit set might vary. For example, in base φ (golden ratio), digits can be 0 and 1. But the user mentions \"the value of the k-th digit\", which in standard integer bases would be integers between 0 and g-1. If the base is non-integer, the digits could still be integers, but sometimes not. However, the problem says \"C_k is the value of that digit\", so perhaps digits are allowed to be non-integer? But in the linked paper for g=2, digits are 0 and 1, which are integers. So the problem is likely considering integer bases with digits as integers. Hence, including g as an integer >=2 is a valid assumption.\n\nBut the user hasn't explicitly stated that, so perhaps it's better to list it as an assumption. So:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- The base g is an integer greater than or equal to 2.\n\n- The number is expressed as ∑_{k=1}^∞ (C_k / g^{Z(k)}), where C_k is the value of the k-th non-zero digit in base g.\n\n- Each C_k is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ C_k ≤ g - 1.\n\n- The function Z(k) eventually dominates any polynomial; that is, for any polynomial P(k), there exists an integer K such that Z(k) > P(k) for all k ≥ K.\n\nBut wait, the original problem states \"any number less than 1 can be expressed in base g as ...\", so perhaps the first assumption is that the number is less than 1. But in the re-expression using non-zero digits, they are still talking about numbers less than 1. So maybe the number is less than 1. But the problem as posed in the \"Problem\" part is about numbers of the form sum_{k=1}^∞ (C_k / g^{Z(k)}). So maybe that's part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Wait, the original problem is asking whether any number of this form (with Z(k) eventually dominating any polynomial) is transcendental. So the assumptions would be the conditions on the number, which are:\n\n- The number is expressed in base g as ∑_{k=1}^∞ (C_k / g^{Z(k)}).\n\n- The base g is an integer ≥2.\n\n- Each C_k is an integer with 1 ≤ C_k ≤ g−1.\n\n- The function Z(k) eventually dominates any polynomial.\n\nBut the problem is whether such numbers are transcendental. So the problem is to prove that any number meeting these conditions is transcendental.\n\nWait, but in the example provided by the user, the original problem was about proving A(n) divisible by 91, and the assumptions were n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So in that example, they split the original problem's conditions into assumptions. So here, in the current problem, the user is asking if numbers expressed in this way with Z(k) dominating any polynomial are transcendental. The conditions for such numbers are:\n\n1. The number is expressed as sum_{k=1}^\\infty C_k /g^{Z(k)}.\n\n2. Z(k) eventually dominates any polynomial.\n\nAdditionally, base g is an integer >=2, and digits C_k are between 1 and g-1 (since they are non-zero digits in base g). These are implicit conditions for the digit expansion. So the assumptions should list these conditions.\n\nSo, structuring:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- The number is expressed in base g as ∑_{k=1}^∞ (Cₖ/g^{Z(k)}), where Cₖ is the k-th non-zero digit.\n\n- Base g is an integer greater than or equal to 2.\n\n- Each digit Cₖ is an integer with 1 ≤ Cₖ ≤ g−1.\n\n- The function Z(k) eventually dominates any polynomial: for every polynomial P(k), there exists K such that Z(k) > P(k) for all k ≥ K.\n\nProblem:\n\nIs there a proof that any number of this form is transcendental?\n\nWait, but the original question is phrased as: \"Is there a proof that any number of this form is transcendental?\" So the problem is to determine whether such numbers are transcendental, given the assumptions. Therefore, the assumptions are the conditions on the number (base g, form of the sum, Z(k) dominating polynomials), and the problem is the question of whether they're transcendental.\n\nBut in the example, the problem was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\", with assumptions on n. So here, similarly, the problem is \"Prove that any number of this form is transcendental\", with the listed assumptions.\n\nBut the user's original question is phrased as: \"Is there a proof that any number of this form is transcendental?\" So perhaps the problem is \"Prove that any number of this form is transcendental.\" But the user is asking if such a proof exists. However, according to the example, the problem is structured as the statement to prove, regardless of whether the answer is known. So in the example, the problem was \"Prove that A(n)... is divisible by 91\", even if the original question might have been \"Is A(n) divisible by 91?\".\n\nSo, following the example's structure, the problem should be phrased as the statement to prove, which in this case would be \"Prove that any number of the form [...] is transcendental.\" However, the original question is asking whether such a proof exists. But the user's example converted the original question into a \"Prove that...\" statement. So perhaps we need to do the same here.\n\nTherefore, the problem statement would be: \"Prove that any number of the form ∑_{k=1}^∞ (Cₖ/g^{Z(k)}) where Z(k) eventually dominates any polynomial is transcendental.\"\n\nBut the user also mentions that they found a paper for the case g=2, so maybe the problem is to generalize that result. However, the way the user phrases it is asking if there's a proof for the general case. But according to the example, the problem should be structured as a statement to prove, given the assumptions. So even if the answer is not known, the task is to format the problem as per the instructions, not to answer it.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- The number is expressed in base g as ∑_{k=1}^∞ (Cₖ/g^{Z(k)}), where Cₖ is the k-th non-zero digit.\n\n- Base g is an integer greater than or equal to 2.\n\n- Each Cₖ is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ Cₖ ≤ g−1.\n\n- The function Z(k) eventually dominates any polynomial; that is, for every polynomial P(k), there exists an integer K such that Z(k) > P(k) for all k ≥ K.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that any number of this form is transcendental.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user is asking \"Is there a proof that any number of this form is transcendental?\" So perhaps the problem is to determine whether such a proof exists. But according to the example, the problem is stated as the claim to be proven. For instance, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem was \"Prove that... is divisible by 91.\"\n\nTherefore, even if the original question is phrased as a question (\"Is there a proof...\"), the formatted problem should be the statement to prove. So in this case, \"Prove that any number of this form is transcendental.\"\n\nBut perhaps the user wants to preserve the question as a question. Wait, looking back at the example, the original problem was \"Prove that...\", and the formatted problem was \"Prove that...\". The user's instruction says to structure the problem as per the format, which includes the \"Problem:\" line. So regardless of whether the original is a question or a request for proof, we structure it as the problem statement to be proven, given the assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be structured with assumptions and the problem line as the statement to prove.",
