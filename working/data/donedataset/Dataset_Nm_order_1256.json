    "Content": "Let $H$ be a proper subgroup of $p$-group $G$. Show that the normalizer of $H$ in $G$, denoted $N_G(H)$, is strictly larger than $H$, and that $H$ is contained in a normal subgroup of index $p$. Here's what I've got so far: If $H$ is normal, $N_G(H)$ is all of $G$ and we are done. If $H$ is not normal, then suppose for the sake of contradiction that $N_G(H)=H$. Then there is no element outside of $H$ that fixes $H$ by conjugation. But the center $Z(G)$ of $G$ does fix $H$, so $Z(G)$ must be a subgroup of $H$. Don't know if I'm going on the right path or not, but either way can't really think my way out of this one... Any help would be appreciated.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You are on the right track. Now look at the subgroup $H/Z$ of $G/Z$. By induction, its normalizer is strictly larger than $H/Z$. Say it contains the residue class $\\overline x$ of $x \\in G$ where $\\overline x \\not\\in H/Z$. Now show that $x$ also normalizes $H$ in $G$ to get a contradiction.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the problem is about p-groups and their subgroups. Specifically, we need to show two things: first, that if H is a proper subgroup of a p-group G, then the normalizer N_G(H) is strictly larger than H. Second, that H is contained in a normal subgroup of G with index p. \n\nStarting with the first part. Let's recall that in p-groups, several properties hold. For example, the center Z(G) of a p-group is non-trivial. Also, every proper subgroup of a p-group is contained in a larger subgroup, and normalizers grow in p-groups. That might be relevant here.\n\nThe user mentioned trying to use the center. If H is not normal, then N_G(H) = H leads to a contradiction because the center Z(G) must centralize H, meaning Z(G) is in H. But since G is a p-group, Z(G) is non-trivial, so H contains a nontrivial central element. However, maybe we can use induction here. Let's think about the class equation or the action of G on H by conjugation.\n\nWait, another approach: consider the action of G on the conjugates of H. The number of conjugates is [G : N_G(H)]. If N_G(H) = H, then the number of conjugates is [G : H]. But in a p-group, the number of conjugates should be congruent to 1 mod p, by Sylow's theorem? Wait, Sylow applies to Sylow p-subgroups, but maybe there's a similar counting principle here.\n\nAlternatively, since H is a proper subgroup, we can use the fact that in a p-group, if H is a proper subgroup, then H is properly contained in its normalizer. This is a standard result in group theory for p-groups. The idea is to use the center. Since Z(G) is non-trivial, take an element z in Z(G) of order p. If z is in H, then consider the subgroup generated by H and z. If z is not in H, then adding z to H would normalize H because z is central. Wait, maybe that's the key.\n\nWait, here's a more detailed approach. Let’s use induction on the order of G. For the base case, if |G|=p, then H is trivial, and N_G(H)=G, which is larger. Now assume the result holds for all p-groups of order less than |G|. Since G is a p-group, Z(G) is non-trivial. Let Z = Z(G). If H contains Z, then consider G/Z. Since H/Z is a proper subgroup of G/Z, by induction, N_{G/Z}(H/Z) is larger than H/Z. The preimage of this normalizer in G would then be a larger normalizer than H. If H does not contain Z, then there exists an element z in Z not in H. Then since z centralizes H, we have that H is contained in N_G(H), which includes z, so N_G(H) is larger than H. Hence, either way, N_G(H) > H.\n\nSo that seems to work. Therefore, the first part is proven by considering the center and using induction.\n\nFor the second part, that H is contained in a normal subgroup of index p. Let's think. In a p-group, every maximal subgroup is normal of index p. So perhaps we can take a maximal subgroup M containing H. But H might not be contained in a maximal subgroup. Wait, no, in a finite p-group, every proper subgroup is contained in a maximal subgroup, which is normal and of index p. So if H is proper, then it is contained in some maximal M, which is normal in G with [G : M] = p. So H ≤ M < G, and M is normal. Thus, the second part follows from the properties of p-groups.\n\nBut wait, is every maximal subgroup of a p-group normal? Yes, because in a nilpotent group (which p-groups are), every maximal subgroup is normal. Therefore, H being proper is contained in some maximal subgroup, which is normal of index p. So that part is straightforward once you know the properties of p-groups.\n\nSo putting it all together, the problem requires applying properties of p-groups, especially the existence of a non-trivial center and induction for the normalizer part, and the fact that maximal subgroups are normal of index p for the second part.",
