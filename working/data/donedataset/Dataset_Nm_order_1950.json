    "Content": "I recently read the elegant paper Generalized Frobenius Schur Numbers , by Bump and Ginzburg, which I learned about here . The results in this paper imply the following: Let $G$ be a finite group where every element is conjugate to its inverse. Then, for any $x \\in G$, the number of ways to write $x$ as $ghg^{-1} h^{-1}$ is equal to the number of ways to write $x$ as $g^2 h^2$. I'll give the proof below, using character theory. I tried to find an elementary proof and failed. Can you do it? $\\def\\CC{\\mathbb{C}}$We need to prove the equality $\\sum_{g, h \\in G} g^2 h^2 = \\sum_{g, h \\in G} g h g^{-1} h^{-1}$ in $\\CC[G]$. Since we have $\\CC[G] \\cong \\bigoplus_V \\mathrm{End}(V)$, where the sum is over irreps of $V$, it is enough to show that both group elements act the same way on each $V$. As I computed in this answer , $\\sum_{g, h \\in G} ghg^{-1} h^{-1}$ acts on an irrep $V$ by $\\left( \\frac{|G|}{\\dim V} \\right)^2$. Now consider $\\sum_{g \\in G} g^2$ acting on an irrep $V$. Since $\\sum_{g \\in G} g^2$ is central in $\\CC[G]$, it must act by a scalar, and computing traces we find that this scalar is $\\frac{1}{\\dim V} \\sum_{g \\in G} \\chi_V(g^2)$. The quantity $\\frac{1}{|G|} \\sum_{g \\in G} \\chi_V(g)^2$ is known as the Frobenius-Schur indicator and is $\\pm 1$ for a group where every element is conjugate to its inverse. So $\\sum_{g \\in G} g^2$ acts on $V$ by $\\pm \\frac{|G|}{dim V}$\nand\n$\\left( \\sum_{g \\in G} g^2 \\right)^2$ acts on $V$ by $\\left( \\frac{|G|}{\\dim V} \\right)^2$. We have shown that $\\sum_{g, h \\in G} ghg^{-1} h^{-1}$ and $\\left( \\sum_{g \\in G} g^2 \\right)^2 = \\sum_{g,h \\in G} g^2 h^2$ act on every irrep by the same scalar, so they are equal in the group algebra. QED. The same argument shows that, in any finite group, the number of ways to write $x$ as $f^2 g^2 h^2$ is the same as the number of ways to write $x$ as $f^2 g h g^{-1} h^{-1}$, using that the Frob. Schur indicator is always $-1$, $0$ or $1$ and thus obeys $\\epsilon^3 = \\epsilon$. In case anyone finds that easier to think about...",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "For $g \\in G$, let $y_g$ be an element of $G$ such that $y_g g y_g^{-1} = g^{-1}$. For $g, h \\in G$, let $x_{g,h} = gy_h^{-1}$.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this problem. The user is asking to restructure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object, followed by the problem statement.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the original problem from the user's question. The title is \"Writing a group element as $ghg^{-1} h^{-1}$ and as $g^2 h^2$\". The problem statement involves proving that in a finite group where every element is conjugate to its inverse, the number of ways to write any element $x$ as a commutator $ghg^{-1}h^{-1}$ is equal to the number of ways to write it as a product of squares $g^2 h^2$.\n\nLooking at the example, the assumptions were about the integer $n$ being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the key assumptions are about the group $G$ and the elements in it. The problem mentions that $G$ is a finite group where every element is conjugate to its inverse. Additionally, the problem is about any element $x$ in $G$. So, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. $G$ is a finite group.\n2. Every element of $G$ is conjugate to its inverse.\n3. $x$ is an element of $G$.\n\nEach assumption is on a separate line, addressing one property. The problem then is to prove the equality of the number of ways to express $x$ as a commutator and as a product of squares.\n\nI need to check if there are more assumptions. The original problem also mentions \"for any $x \\in G$\", which is covered by assumption 3. The group being finite is essential because the proof uses character theory and properties like the Frobenius-Schur indicator, which are relevant for finite groups. The conjugacy condition is crucial because it relates to the Frobenius-Schur indicator being ±1, which is used in the proof.\n\nSo, the assumptions are correctly captured. The problem statement should then be to prove that for any $x \\in G$, the number of ways to write $x$ as $ghg^{-1}h^{-1}$ is equal to the number of ways to write $x$ as $g^2 h^2$.\n\nI need to ensure that the problem is stated clearly without extra details from the proof. The user provided their own proof using character theory, but the problem is to find an elementary proof. However, in the formatted problem, we just need to present the problem, not the request for an elementary proof unless it's part of the problem statement. Wait, the original question says \"Can you do it?\" referring to finding an elementary proof. But in the example, the formatted problem only includes the problem to prove, not the meta-request. So maybe the problem statement should be the actual mathematical statement to prove, not the request for a proof method.\n\nLooking at the example, the original problem included \"Prove that...\" and the formatted problem kept that. Similarly, here, the problem is to prove the equality of the two counts. So the Problem: part should be \"Prove that for any $x \\in G$, the number of ways to write $x$ as $ghg^{-1}h^{-1}$ is equal to the number of ways to write $x$ as $g^2 h^2$.\"\n\nBut in the example, they removed the part about the divisibility by 7 in the assumption. Wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, looking back, the original example was:\n\nOriginal problem:\nProve that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Wait, perhaps the example was incorrect? Wait, 91 is 7*13. So if the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7, which would make the problem easier. But maybe the example was a mistake. However, given that the user provided that example, I have to follow their structure even if it's possibly incorrect. So perhaps the user wants to list all conditions, even if some are redundant. But in the given example, the original problem didn't state that n must be divisible by 7, but the formatted problem added that. That suggests that maybe the user made an error in their example. However, the task is to follow the user's example.\n\nBut in the current problem, the original question's problem is under the conditions that G is a finite group where every element is conjugate to its inverse. So the assumptions are:\n\n- G is a finite group.\n\n- Every element of G is conjugate to its inverse.\n\n- x is an element of G.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list those three assumptions.\n\nThen the problem is to prove the equality of the number of ways to write x as the two expressions.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a finite group,\nEvery element of G is conjugate to its inverse,\nx is an element of G.\n\nProblem:\nProve that for any x ∈ G, the number of ways to write x as ghg^{-1}h^{-1} is equal to the number of ways to write x as g²h².\n\nI think that's the correct structure. The key is to list each assumption separately, even if they are related. The third assumption is that x is in G, which is necessary because the problem is about any x in G. Each assumption is a single condition applied to one object (G, elements of G, x).\n\nI need to ensure that the problem statement is concise and matches the original. The original problem states \"the number of ways to write x as...\" so the problem should reflect that.",
