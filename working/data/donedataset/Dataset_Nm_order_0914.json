    "Content": "I'm trying to show that $$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left[\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{k} - \\log n\\right] = -\\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-t} \\log t \\,dt.$$ In other words, I'm trying to show that the above definitions of the Euler-Mascheroni constant $\\gamma$ are equivalent. In another post here (which I can't seem to find now) someone noted that $$\\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-t} \\log t \\,dt = \\left.\\frac{d}{dx} \\int_0^{\\infty} t^x e^{-t} \\,dt \\right|_{x=0} = \\Gamma'(1) = \\psi(1),$$ where $\\psi$ is the digamma function.  This may be a good place to start on the right-hand side. For the left-hand side I was tempted to represent the terms with integrals.  It is not hard to show that $$\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{k} = \\int_0^1 \\frac{1-x^n}{1-x} \\,dx,$$ but I'm not sure this gets us anywhere. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "It is easy to prove that the function $$ f_n(x) = \\begin{cases} \\left( 1 - \\frac{x}{n}\\right)^n & 0 \\leq x \\leq n \\\\ 0 & x > n \\end{cases}$$ satisfies $0 \\leq f_n(x) \\uparrow e^{-x}$. Thus by dominated convergence theorem, $$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-x} \\log x \\; dx = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\int_{0}^{n} \\left( 1 - \\frac{x}{n}\\right)^n \\log x \\; dx. $$ Now by the substitution $x = nu$, we have $$\\begin{align*}\n\\int_{0}^{n} \\left( 1 - \\frac{x}{n}\\right)^n \\log x \\; dx\n&= n\\int_{0}^{1} \\left( 1 - u\\right)^n (\\log n + \\log u) \\; du \\\\\n&= \\frac{n}{n+1}\\log n + n\\int_{0}^{1} \\left( 1 - u\\right)^n \\log u \\; du \\\\\n&= \\frac{n}{n+1}\\log n + n\\int_{0}^{1} v^n \\log (1-v) \\; dv \\\\\n&= \\frac{n}{n+1}\\log n - n\\int_{0}^{1} v^n \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{v^k}{k} \\right) \\; dv \\\\\n&= \\frac{n}{n+1}\\log n - n \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{k(n+k+1)} \\\\\n&= \\frac{n}{n+1}\\log n - \\frac{n}{n+1} \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{1}{k} - \\frac{1}{n+k+1}\\right) \\\\\n&= \\frac{n}{n+1} \\left( \\log n - \\sum_{k=1}^{n+1} \\frac{1}{k} \\right).\n\\end{align*}$$ Therefore taking $n \\to \\infty$ yields $-\\gamma$.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to show that the Euler-Mascheroni constant γ can be expressed both as the limit of the difference between the harmonic series and the natural logarithm of n as n approaches infinity, and as the negative integral of e^(-t) log t from 0 to infinity. \n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions in the problem. The original question mentions that γ is defined as the limit of the sum of 1/k from k=1 to n minus log n as n approaches infinity. The goal is to prove this is equal to the negative integral given. \n\nLooking at the user's approach, they mentioned using integral representations. They also referenced the gamma function and its derivative at x=0, leading to Γ’(1) which is ψ(1), the digamma function. So the assumptions here involve properties of the gamma function, the digamma function, and perhaps integral representations of the harmonic series.\n\nThe user also showed that the sum 1/k can be written as an integral from 0 to 1 of (1 - x^n)/(1 - x) dx. But they are unsure how to proceed. So maybe the key is to connect this integral representation to the integral involving e^(-t) log t.\n\nAnother point is the differentiation under the integral sign for the gamma function. Since Γ(x) = ∫0^∞ t^(x-1) e^(-t) dt, differentiating with respect to x at x=1 would give Γ’(1) = ∫0^∞ e^(-t) log t dt. Since γ is known to be -Γ’(1), that connects the integral to γ.\n\nOn the other side, the limit definition of γ as the difference between the harmonic series and log n. To connect these, perhaps express the harmonic series using integrals, then take the limit as n approaches infinity, subtract log n, and show that it equals -Γ’(1).\n\nPossible steps:\n\n1. Start with the limit definition: γ = lim_{n→∞} [∑_{k=1}^n 1/k - log n].\n\n2. Express the sum ∑_{k=1}^n 1/k as an integral. The user mentioned ∫₀¹ (1 - xⁿ)/(1 - x) dx. Let's verify that: ∫₀¹ (1 - xⁿ)/(1 - x) dx = ∫₀¹ (1 + x + x² + ... + x^{n-1}) dx = ∑_{k=1}^n 1/k. Yes, that works.\n\n3. Then, the limit becomes γ = lim_{n→∞} [∫₀¹ (1 - xⁿ)/(1 - x) dx - log n].\n\n4. The next step is to relate this integral to the integral involving e^{-t} log t. Maybe perform a substitution or relate the integral over x to an integral over t.\n\n5. Alternatively, consider the integral representation of log n. We know that log n = ∫₀¹ (n - 1)/(1 - x) dx, but that might not be directly helpful. Another approach: recall that log n = ∫₀^1 (n - 1)/x dx? Wait, maybe not. Let's think.\n\n6. Alternatively, use the fact that ∫₀^∞ e^{-t} dt = 1, and maybe split the integral into parts. Also, integrating log t might relate to the integral of 1/t, which connects to the harmonic series.\n\nWait, here's a different approach. Start with the integral ∫₀^∞ e^{-t} log t dt. Let’s split this integral into two parts: from 0 to 1 and from 1 to ∞. Then, maybe use substitution or integration by parts.\n\nAlternatively, relate the integral to the limit definition. Since the gamma function is involved, and Γ’(1) = -γ, perhaps use the expansion of Γ(x) around x=1.\n\nBut the user already knows that Γ’(1) = ψ(1) = -γ. So if they can show that the integral ∫₀^∞ e^{-t} log t dt = -γ, then that would do it. But how to connect this integral to the limit definition.\n\nAnother idea: express the sum ∑1/k as an integral involving e^{-t}. For example, 1/k = ∫₀^∞ e^{-kt} dt. Then sum over k gives ∑_{k=1}^n ∫₀^∞ e^{-kt} dt = ∫₀^∞ ∑_{k=1}^n e^{-kt} dt = ∫₀^∞ (e^{-t} (1 - e^{-nt}))/(1 - e^{-t}) dt. Then subtract log n and take the limit as n→∞.\n\nBut log n can also be written as ∫₀^∞ (e^{-t} - e^{-nt}) / t dt. So maybe combining these integrals and taking the limit.\n\nThis is getting a bit complex. The key is to structure the problem by identifying the assumptions and the problem statement as per the required format. The original problem is to show the equivalence of two definitions of γ. The assumptions would include the definitions involved, like the limit of the harmonic series minus log n, and the integral expression involving e^{-t} log t. Also, the properties of the gamma function and digamma function mentioned in the question are part of the context but may not be assumptions unless they are given as known.\n\nSo, in the formatted problem, the assumptions should list the conditions and definitions given. For example, γ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant defined as the limit, and the integral expression involving the gamma function's derivative. But since the problem is to show equivalence, the main assumptions are the definitions provided in each expression.\n\nWait, the user is trying to show that two definitions of γ are equivalent. Therefore, the assumptions might not be additional constraints but rather the definitions themselves. However, the problem statement as per the format example seems to list assumptions that are given conditions. In the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, perhaps the assumptions are that γ is defined as the limit and as the negative integral, and the problem is to show their equivalence.\n\nBut the original problem states: \"Show that γ = -∫₀^∞ e^{-t} log t dt, where γ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.\" So the user is starting from the limit definition and wants to show it equals the integral. Therefore, the assumptions would be the definitions and properties used in the problem.\n\nBut the user mentions another post where they saw that the integral equals Γ’(1) = ψ(1). So maybe the assumptions include the relation between the integral and the gamma function derivative.\n\nHowever, in the problem formatting, assumptions should be the given conditions. Since the problem is to prove an equivalence between two definitions, the assumptions would likely be the properties that the user is allowed to use, such as integral representations of the harmonic series, properties of the gamma function, etc. But the example given by the user in the original query structured assumptions as conditions on the variables (n is integer, n divisible by 7). Here, the problem is different because it's an equivalence proof, so maybe the assumptions are the definitions and any given integral representations.\n\nBut the user’s formatted example includes specific conditions on the variable (n being integer and divisible by 7). In the current problem, the Euler-Mascheroni constant is a fixed constant, so there are no variables with conditions. Therefore, the assumptions may include the integral representation of the harmonic series, the relation between Γ’(1) and the integral, etc. But since the problem is to show the equivalence, perhaps the assumptions are the mathematical properties that are taken as given. However, the example provided by the user lists assumptions as conditions on the problem's variables, not general mathematical knowledge.\n\nWait, in the example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, with assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the current problem is about showing an equality involving γ, so there are no variables with conditions. Therefore, the assumptions might be the definitions or properties used in the problem. But the original problem's context includes the user mentioning integral representations and digamma functions. However, in the problem formatting, the assistant is supposed to extract the assumptions from the problem statement, not from the user's approach.\n\nLooking back at the original problem statement on Math Stack Exchange: The user wants to show that the limit definition of γ equals the integral definition. The problem statement includes that γ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant, and the user references integral representations and properties of the gamma function. However, in the problem formatting, assumptions should be the conditions given in the problem. Since the problem is to show the equivalence, the only assumption is that γ is defined by the limit, and the task is to show it equals the integral. Alternatively, if the problem assumes both definitions and asks to prove equivalence, but the user is starting from one definition to reach the other.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- γ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant defined as γ = lim_{n→∞} [∑_{k=1}^n 1/k - log n].\n\n- The integral ∫₀^∞ e^{-t} log t dt is related to Γ’(1).\n\nBut the problem is to show that γ equals -∫₀^∞ e^{-t} log t dt. Therefore, the assumption is that γ is defined by the limit, and the problem is to show it equals the negative integral. The properties about Γ’(1) are part of the solution approach, not assumptions. \n\nThus, in the formatted problem:\n\nAssumption: \nγ is defined as γ = lim_{n→∞} [∑_{k=1}^n 1/k - log n].\nProblem: \nShow that γ = -∫₀^∞ e^{-t} log t dt.\n\nBut the user also mentioned the integral representation of the sum 1/k as ∫₀¹ (1 - xⁿ)/(1 - x) dx. However, since the problem is to show the equivalence, that integral representation might be a tool to use, but it's not an assumption unless the problem states it as given. The original problem statement by the user includes that they derived that integral for the sum, but they're not sure how to proceed. Therefore, perhaps the assumption is that the sum can be represented by that integral.\n\nAlternatively, the assumptions are the definitions and any given integral representations provided in the problem statement. The problem statement mentions that ∑_{k=1}^n 1/k = ∫₀¹ (1 - xⁿ)/(1 - x) dx, so that would be an assumption.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nγ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant defined as γ = lim_{n→∞} [∑_{k=1}^n 1/k - log n],\n∑_{k=1}^n 1/k can be expressed as ∫₀¹ (1 - xⁿ)/(1 - x) dx,\nΓ'(1) = ∫₀^∞ e^{-t} log t dt,\nΓ'(1) = ψ(1), where ψ is the digamma function.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to show the equivalence between the limit and the integral. The user mentions that they saw another post relating the integral to Γ’(1) = ψ(1), which is known to be -γ. Therefore, if we can use the fact that ψ(1) = -γ, then showing that the integral equals Γ’(1) would complete the proof. However, in the problem statement, the user is trying to connect the limit definition to the integral. Therefore, the assumptions might include the relation between Γ’(1) and the integral, but if that's part of the solution, then it's not an assumption.\n\nHowever, the problem formatting example included assumptions on the problem's variables, not general mathematical knowledge. Since the user is allowed to use properties of the gamma function and integral representations, perhaps those are considered background knowledge and not assumptions. Therefore, the main assumption is that γ is defined by the limit, and the problem is to show it equals the integral.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is to show the equivalence, so the assumptions are the two definitions, but that doesn't make sense. The original problem is to show that the limit equals the integral, so the assumption is the limit definition, and the problem is to show it's equal to the integral.\n\nIn the example provided by the user, the assumption listed includes that n is an integer and divisible by 7, which are conditions on n. In the current problem, there are no such conditions, so perhaps the only assumption is that γ is defined by the limit. However, the user also uses the integral representation of the sum, so maybe that's an assumption.\n\nBut the user derived that ∑1/k = ∫₀¹ (1 - xⁿ)/(1 - x) dx, but they're not sure if that helps. So perhaps that integral representation is an assumption or a given property.\n\nGiven the user's problem statement, the key elements are:\n\n- γ is defined as the limit of the sum minus log n.\n\n- The integral involving e^{-t} log t is another expression for γ.\n\n- The user references Γ’(1) and ψ(1), which are mathematical properties.\n\nTherefore, structuring the problem:\n\nAssumption:\nγ is defined as γ = lim_{n→∞} [∑_{k=1}^n 1/k - log n],\nThe digamma function evaluated at 1 is ψ(1) = -γ,\nThe integral ∫₀^∞ e^{-t} log t dt equals Γ’(1),\nΓ’(1) can be expressed as ψ(1).\n\nProblem:\nShow that γ = -∫₀^∞ e^{-t} log t dt.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is to connect the limit definition to the integral without assuming Γ’(1) = -γ. Alternatively, the problem is to show the equivalence between the two definitions, so the assumptions would be the definitions and any given properties used.\n\nAlternatively, considering the example, the assumptions were on the variable n. Here, since there's no variable, the assumptions are the properties or conditions given in the problem. The original problem states that γ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant, and the task is to show that the two expressions are equivalent. Therefore, the assumption is that γ is defined by the limit, and the problem is to show it equals the integral. The properties about the gamma function are part of the solution path, not assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nγ is defined as γ = lim_{n→∞} [∑_{k=1}^n 1/k - log n].\n\nProblem:\nShow that γ = -∫₀^∞ e^{-t} log t dt.\n\nHowever, the user also mentioned the integral representation of the sum ∑1/k, which might be considered an assumption. But since that's a derived result by the user, perhaps it's part of the solution approach. The problem statement includes that the user has shown ∑1/k = ∫₀¹ (1 - xⁿ)/(1 - x) dx, but is stuck. So maybe that integral is given as part of the problem's assumptions.\n\nIncluding that, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nγ is defined as γ = lim_{n→∞} [∑_{k=1}^n 1/k - log n],\n∑_{k=1}^n 1/k can be expressed as ∫₀¹ (1 - xⁿ)/(1 - x) dx.\n\nProblem:\nShow that γ = -∫₀^∞ e^{-t} log t dt.\n\nBut the user also mentioned the relation to Γ’(1) and ψ(1). However, since that's part of their research, not the problem's given conditions, perhaps it shouldn't be included in the assumptions. The problem is to show the equality, so the assumptions are the starting points provided in the problem.\n\nThus, after careful consideration, the correct formatted problem should list the definition of γ as the limit and possibly the integral representation of the harmonic sum if it's considered a given tool. But since the problem is to show the equivalence, the primary assumption is the limit definition. The integral expression of the sum might be part of the solution method rather than an assumption.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem is:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nγ is defined as the limit $\\gamma = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{k} - \\log n \\right)$.\nProblem: \nShow that $\\gamma = -\\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-t} \\log t \\, dt$.\n###",
