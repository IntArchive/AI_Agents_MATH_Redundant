    "Content": "Let $a \\in \\mathbb{N}.$ Prove there are infinitely many primes $p$ satisfying\n$$\\left(\\frac{a}{p}\\right) =1.$$ Remark: One may need to use the Dirichlet theorem, which states that if $a,m$ are coprime then there exists infinitely many primes $p$ such that $p \\equiv a \\pmod{m}.$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You don't need Dirichlet's theorem. The following more general result is true. Proposition: Let $f(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$ be a nonconstant polynomial with nonzero constant term. Then there exist infinitely many primes $p$ such that $p | f(n)$ for some $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. To get the desired result take $f(x) = x^2 - a$. Proof 1. Euler's proof of the infinitude of the primes carries over to this result. Certainly there exists at least one such prime. If $p_1, ... p_n$ are a finite collection of such primes, then $\\frac{f(k f(0) p_1 ... p_n))}{f(0)}$ is relatively prime to each $p_i$ for any $k$, so for sufficiently large $k$ it has a prime divisor not among the $p_i$. Proof 2. More generally we can replace $f(n)$ by a sequence which grows at most polynomially. See http://qchu.wordpress.com/2009/09/02/some-remarks-on-the-infinitude-of-primes/ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original problem is about proving that there are infinitely many primes p such that the Legendre symbol (a/p) equals 1. The remark mentions using Dirichlet's theorem, which is about primes in arithmetic progressions. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states \"Let a ∈ ℕ. Prove there are infinitely many primes p satisfying (a/p) =1.\" The Legendre symbol (a/p) =1 means that a is a quadratic residue modulo p. So the assumptions here would include that a is a natural number. But are there any other implicit assumptions? For example, when using Dirichlet's theorem, we often require that a and m are coprime. However, the problem as stated doesn't mention any coprimality condition. But maybe the user included the remark about Dirichlet's theorem as a hint, so perhaps the problem assumes that the user can apply that theorem under certain conditions.\n\nWait, the original problem just says \"Let a ∈ ℕ.\" So the only explicit assumption is that a is a natural number. However, when applying Dirichlet's theorem to primes in arithmetic progressions, we need a and m to be coprime. But how does that relate here? The problem is about quadratic residues. Maybe the answer involves choosing an appropriate modulus m such that primes congruent to certain residues mod m will have (a/p)=1. \n\nBut in terms of assumptions for the problem statement, the user didn't specify any conditions on a beyond being a natural number. However, perhaps the problem implicitly assumes that a is a quadratic residue modulo infinitely many primes, which might require that a is not a perfect square? Wait, no, even if a is a square, there are still primes where a is a quadratic residue. For example, if a is a square, then (a/p) =1 for all primes p not dividing a. But Dirichlet's theorem would still apply here. Hmm.\n\nBut the problem as stated doesn't have any restrictions on a, so the assumptions should just be that a is a natural number. However, perhaps the application of Dirichlet's theorem would require that a is square-free or something else? Wait, no. The Dirichlet theorem is used for arithmetic progressions. The Legendre symbol condition (a/p)=1 can be related to p lying in certain residue classes modulo 4a or something like that. For example, when a is a prime q, then (q/p)=1 if p is congruent to a quadratic residue modulo q. By quadratic reciprocity, this can be transformed into conditions on p modulo 4q or something. Then using Dirichlet's theorem, which requires that the residues are coprime to the modulus. So perhaps the modulus here is 4a, but if a is even, maybe 8a? \n\nBut in any case, the problem's assumptions as given in the original question don't specify any further conditions on a. The remark mentions using Dirichlet's theorem, which requires coprimality. So perhaps the actual assumption needed is that a and m are coprime, but in the problem statement, m is not mentioned. Wait, the original problem is to prove that for any natural number a, there are infinitely many primes p where (a/p)=1. So the user's formatted problem should list the assumptions. The original problem states \"Let a ∈ ℕ.\" So the first assumption is that a is a natural number. However, to apply Dirichlet's theorem, maybe there's an implicit assumption that a is square-free or that certain congruences are satisfied. But since the problem doesn't state that, perhaps the only explicit assumption is that a is a natural number. However, in the example given by the user, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7,\" which wasn't in the original problem but was part of the solution. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem listed assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" But that seems incorrect because the original problem didn't have that assumption. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the example? Let me check.\n\nOriginal example: The original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem's assumption lists n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But that contradicts the original problem's statement. Wait, perhaps the example is incorrect? Because if the original problem states \"for every integer n,\" then the assumption shouldn't include that n is divisible by 7. That would be an error in the example. So maybe the user's example is flawed, which could affect how I structure my answer.\n\nBut in the current problem, the original question says \"Let a ∈ ℕ. Prove there are infinitely many primes p satisfying (a/p)=1.\" So the only explicit assumption is that a is a natural number. But perhaps in the solution, we need to handle different cases of a, like whether a is a square or not, or other properties. However, the problem as stated doesn't restrict a beyond being in ℕ. Therefore, the formatted problem's assumption should just be \"a is a natural number.\"\n\nSo the problem statement is: Prove there are infinitely many primes p such that (a/p)=1. Therefore, the formatted version should have assumption: a is a natural number. Problem: Prove there are infinitely many primes p satisfying (a/p)=1.\n\nBut the remark mentions using Dirichlet's theorem, which might require a and m to be coprime. But since the problem doesn't specify that, perhaps there's an implicit assumption that a is square-free? Or maybe not. Wait, even if a is not square-free, the Legendre symbol (a/p) can be 1. For example, if a=4, then (4/p)=1 for all primes p≠2. So there are infinitely many primes where (4/p)=1. Similarly, if a=9, same thing. So maybe the problem holds for any a∈ℕ, regardless of being square or not. Therefore, the only assumption needed is that a is a natural number. Therefore, the formatted problem should have assumption: a is a natural number, and the problem as stated.",
