    "Content": "This comes from Munkres 38.2. Let $Y$ be the compactification of $(0,1)$ induced by $h(x) = (x,\\sin(1/x))$. Show that $g(x) = \\cos(1/x)$ cannot be extended to this compactification $Y$. Also I wonder in general how to show a function can or cannot be extended to a compactification induced by some other function. Here is my attempted solution under the hint of Brian Scott: Let $Y$ denote the compactification of $(0,1)$ induced by $h(x) = (x,\\sin (1/x))$. Let $Y_0$ be $H(Y)$ where $H$ is the extension of $h$. Suppose we can extend $g$ to a continuous function $G: Y\\to \\mathbb{R}$, then the function $G\\circ H^{-1}: Y_0 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is also continuous. Consider the sequence $\\{h(\\frac{1}{k\\pi})\\}_{k\\in\\mathbb{Z}_+} = \\{(\\frac{1}{k\\pi}, 0)\\}_{k\\in\\mathbb{Z}_+}$ in $Y_0$, then $h(\\frac{1}{k\\pi}) \\to (0,0)$ in $Y_0$, by continuity of $G\\circ H^{-1}$ we must have $\\lim_{k\\to\\infty}G(H^{-1}(h(\\frac{1}{k\\pi}))) = \\lim_{k\\to\\infty} G(\\frac{1}{k\\pi}) = G(0)$. However, $G(H^{-1}(h(\\frac{1}{k\\pi}))) = g(\\frac{1}{k\\pi}) = (-1)^k$ does not converge, which is a contradiction. Hence $g$ cannot be extended to a continuous map on $Y$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "HINT: Consider the sequence $\\langle x_n:n\\in\\Bbb Z^+\\rangle$ in $(0,1)$, where $x_n=\\frac1{n\\pi}$. What is the sequence $\\langle h(x_n):n\\in\\Bbb Z^+\\rangle$? Does it converge in $Y$? What is the sequence $\\langle g(x_n):n\\in\\Bbb Z^+\\rangle$? Remember, if we can extend $g$ to a function $G:Y\\to\\Bbb R$, we must have $G\\big(h(x)\\big)=g(x)$ for each $x\\in(0,1)$.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is asking about extending a function to a compactification induced by another function. The specific example is from Munkres, problem 38.2. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the key elements here. The compactification Y is induced by the function h(x) = (x, sin(1/x)). They want to show that g(x) = cos(1/x) cannot be extended to Y. \n\nSo, the main problem is to show that g cannot be extended to Y. The user also mentions a general question about how to determine if a function can be extended to a compactification induced by another function. But the example answer focuses on the specific case with h and g.\n\nLooking at the original problem statement, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. Y is the compactification of (0,1) induced by h(x) = (x, sin(1/x)).\n2. g(x) = cos(1/x) is defined on (0,1).\n3. The goal is to show that g cannot be extended continuously to Y.\n\nWait, the problem says \"induced by h\", which typically means the compactification is the closure of the image of h in some space. Since h maps into the plane, Y is likely the closure of h((0,1)) in ℝ², which is the topologist's sine curve plus the interval. But maybe in Munkres, the compactification is constructed via the Stone-Čech method or another method. Wait, no, Munkres often uses the method of embedding into a compact space and taking the closure. So Y here is the closure of the embedding h, which would be the graph of sin(1/x) for x in (0,1], plus the limit points at x=0. But since sin(1/x) oscillates, the closure would include points (0, y) where y is in [-1,1], right? Wait, no. Wait, the graph of sin(1/x) as x approaches 0 has the vertical segment {0}×[-1,1] as limit points. But in the compactification induced by h, Y is the space (0,1) compactified such that h extends continuously. Wait, perhaps Y is the one-point compactification? No, because the compactification here is induced by h, which is an embedding. So when you take the compactification induced by h, you're essentially taking the closure of h((0,1)) in the target space, which in this case is ℝ². So Y would be the topologist's sine curve, which is compact in ℝ². However, the topologist's sine curve is not compact, wait. Wait, the closure of h((0,1)) in ℝ² is not compact because the topologist's sine curve is not closed in ℝ². Hmm, maybe Munkres is using a different approach. Alternatively, the compactification here might be the Stone-Čech compactification induced by h, but that's more complicated. Wait, the problem says \"the compactification of (0,1) induced by h(x) = (x, sin(1/x))\". In Munkres, when you have a space X and a map h from X to a compact Hausdorff space Z, the induced compactification is the closure of the image of X under h in Z. So if h maps (0,1) into ℝ², then the compactification Y is the closure of h((0,1)) in ℝ². But ℝ² isn't compact, so maybe they consider the one-point compactification? Wait, no. Wait, maybe the compactification here is the space Y = (0,1) ∪ {p}, where p is a point such that h extends to Y. But I'm getting confused. Let me check the user's attempted solution. \n\nIn the user's solution, they mention Y_0 = H(Y), where H is the extension of h. Then they consider the sequence h(1/(kπ)) which converges to (0,0) in Y_0. So the compactification Y includes a point corresponding to x approaching 0, and the limit of h(x) as x approaches 0. But since sin(1/x) oscillates, the limit doesn't exist in ℝ². Therefore, the compactification must include all the limit points of h(x) as x approaches 0 and 1. However, as x approaches 0, h(x) = (x, sin(1/x)) has closure in ℝ² including {0} × [-1,1]. But this is not compact. Therefore, perhaps in this context, the compactification Y is constructed such that the function h extends continuously to Y, and Y is compact. So the points added in the compactification correspond to the \"ends\" of (0,1), but for h to extend continuously, the behavior at the ends must be controlled. However, sin(1/x) doesn't have a limit as x approaches 0, so the compactification would have to include all possible limit points. But this might not be a Hausdorff compactification. Wait, but Munkres usually deals with Hausdorff compactifications. Hmm. Maybe the compactification here is the closure of the graph of h in [0,1] × [-1,1], which is compact. Then Y would be the closure of h((0,1)) in [0,1] × [-1,1], which includes the segment {0} × [-1,1]. However, in that case, the compactification would have many points at x=0, each corresponding to different y values. Then, to extend g(x) = cos(1/x) to Y, you would need to define G(0,y) for y in [-1,1], such that G is continuous. However, as x approaches 0 along different sequences, cos(1/x) can take any value between -1 and 1. But since in the compactification Y, the points at x=0 are distinguished by their y-coordinate (from sin(1/x)), but cos(1/x) and sin(1/x) are related. For example, if x_n = 1/(2πn), then sin(1/x_n) = 0 and cos(1/x_n) = 1. If x_n = 1/( (2n+1)π/2 ), then sin(1/x_n) = ±1 and cos(1/x_n)=0. But for the compactification Y, each point at x=0 is determined by the limit of sin(1/x). However, cos(1/x) doesn't have a limit, so for each point (0,y) in Y, if we try to define G(0,y), we need to have that whenever a sequence x_n approaches 0 such that sin(1/x_n) approaches y, then cos(1/x_n) must approach G(0,y). But since for a given y, there might be sequences x_n and x'_n such that sin(1/x_n) = y but cos(1/x_n) can be different. For example, if y=0, then x_n = 1/(nπ), and cos(1/x_n) = (-1)^n, which doesn't converge. Hence, you can't define G(0,0) consistently. Therefore, the problem is that even though h(x) has a limit point (0,0) in Y, the value of g(x) at those points doesn't converge, hence no continuous extension.\n\nSo, the assumptions here are:\n\n- Y is the compactification of (0,1) induced by h(x) = (x, sin(1/x)).\n- g: (0,1) → ℝ defined by g(x) = cos(1/x).\n- The task is to show that g cannot be extended to a continuous function G: Y → ℝ.\n\nThe user's solution uses a sequence 1/(kπ) where h(1/(kπ)) converges to (0,0) in Y, but g(1/(kπ)) alternates between 1 and -1, hence no limit. Therefore, G cannot be defined at (0,0) to make it continuous.\n\nBut according to the example format, assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n- Y is a compactification of the interval (0,1).\n- The compactification Y is induced by the function h(x) = (x, sin(1/x)).\n- The function g(x) = cos(1/x) is defined on (0,1).\n- The problem requires determining if g can be extended to a continuous function G: Y → ℝ.\n\nBut in the original problem, it's already given that Y is the compactification induced by h, and the task is to show that g cannot be extended. So the problem statement is as given.\n\nTherefore, formatted:\n\nAssumption:\nY is the compactification of (0,1) induced by h(x) = (x, sin(1/x)),\ng(x) = cos(1/x) is a function on (0,1).\n\nProblem:\nShow that g cannot be extended to a continuous function G: Y → ℝ.\n\nWait, the original problem in the example included multiple assumptions each on one line, each addressing one property. So in this case:\n\nAssumption:\nY is the compactification of (0,1) induced by h(x) = (x, sin(1/x)),\ng is defined by g(x) = cos(1/x) for x ∈ (0,1).\n\nProblem:\nShow that g cannot be extended to a continuous function on Y.\n\nThat seems to fit the example's structure.",
