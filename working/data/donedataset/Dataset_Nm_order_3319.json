    "AcceptedAnswer": "The comments are misinformed: a monkey saddle is not a Morse singularity. You cannot find the Euler characteristic by counting critical points, since they are not all nondegenerate! Instead you must use the following variation of the Morse Lemma. Consider the sequence of groups $H_*(M_t)$ , where $M_t = f^{-1}(-\\infty, t]$ . This sequence changes precisely for critical values $t$ . So we just need to see what happens at the Monkey saddle (let's say that happens at time $t=1$ ). For $M_{.999}$ , we have a manifold diffeomorphic to a disc, as it has exactly one nondegenerate critical point. Now look at the picture in IV. What happens as we go from the bottom to the top? We've taken $M_{.999} \\times [0,1]$ and added a \"tripod\" on the top --- a space that looks like a thickened letter $Y$ --- by attaching the three boundary arcs $(\\text{3 points}) \\times I$ to $M_{.999} \\times \\{1\\}$ . You can see by the Mayer-Vietoris sequence that the result has $H_*(M_{1.001}) = \\Bbb Z$ in degree 0 and $\\Bbb Z^2$ in degree 3. Another way to think about this: attching this \"tripod\" is functionally equivalent to attaching two handles, which correspond to two nondegenerate index 1 critical points. Anyway, all that's left is to attach the cap, which only adds something to top degree homology. What we get out of this is that the homology of this surface matches up with the torus, and so it is a torus.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. The user wants to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original question is about proving or imagining that certain pictures are portions of a 2-torus. The user mentioned that just counting the genus isn't straightforward for them, so they need another approach.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The problem is about topological spaces represented by pictures, and the key points here would be the properties that define a 2-torus. The 2-torus, or genus-1 torus, has specific characteristics like being a compact orientable surface with genus 1, having Euler characteristic 0, and being homeomorphic to the product space S¹ × S¹. But the question mentions \"all of the following pictures,\" which aren't provided here. However, since the user can't count the genus easily, maybe the assumptions should focus on the properties that each picture must satisfy to be a torus.\n\nSo, each picture must represent a compact orientable surface, have genus 1, and have an Euler characteristic of 0. Alternatively, if the pictures are diagrams like the standard torus with identifications, perhaps the assumptions are about the way the edges are identified. For example, a square with opposite sides identified in the same orientation (aba^{-1}b^{-1}) gives a torus. But without seeing the actual pictures, I need to make educated guesses based on common representations.\n\nThe problem statement is to prove or show that all given pictures are portions of a torus. The user needs to structure this into assumptions and the problem. The key assumptions would be the properties each picture must have that imply it's a torus. Since the user mentioned that counting genus isn't easy, maybe the assumptions relate to other topological invariants or construction methods.\n\nPossible assumptions could be:\n\n- Each picture represents a compact, connected, orientable surface.\n- Each picture has Euler characteristic 0.\n- Each picture is constructed by identifying opposite sides of a polygon with appropriate orientation.\n\nBut since the exact pictures aren't provided, it's tricky. However, based on the context from the original question (referring to images from Bettiol and Curtis), maybe the pictures involve different visual representations of the torus, like different embeddings or identifications.\n\nAnother angle: If the pictures are different polygonal representations with edge identifications, then the assumptions would be about the edge identifications leading to a torus structure. For example, a square with both pairs of opposite sides identified with the same orientation.\n\nAlternatively, if the pictures are embeddings in 3D space, maybe the assumptions relate to the presence of a single hole, which characterizes the torus.\n\nBut since the user can't see the images, the assistant must infer based on standard problems of this type. Common ways to show something is a torus include checking homeomorphism via fundamental polygons or calculating Euler characteristic and orientability.\n\nSo, compiling possible assumptions:\n\n- Each figure is a compact, connected, orientable surface.\n- Each figure has genus 1.\n- Each figure has Euler characteristic 0.\n- Each figure is constructed by identifying edges of a polygon in a way equivalent to the standard torus identification.\n\nBut since the problem is to prove that all pictures are portions of a torus, the assumptions would be the given properties of each picture that allow one to conclude they are tori. But without seeing them, perhaps the key assumptions are the necessary and sufficient conditions for a surface to be a torus.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would list assumptions that each picture satisfies those conditions, and the problem is to prove they are tori. However, the user's example had specific numerical conditions. Here, topological properties are more abstract. So maybe the assumptions are about each picture being a compact orientable surface with certain properties leading to genus 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is presented without explicit numerical assumptions, so the main assumption is that the pictures are surfaces, and the problem is to show they're tori. But according to the example, assumptions should list specific conditions. Since the user's example included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", here maybe the assumptions are that each picture is a compact orientable surface with Euler characteristic 0, etc.\n\nBut given the original question's phrasing, perhaps the assumptions are that each picture is a portion (subset) of a torus, and the problem is to prove they all form the entire torus. However, the question says \"all of the following pictures are a portion of a torus\", which might mean each picture is part of a torus, but the user needs to show they are indeed parts of a torus. But that's a bit vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to show that the depicted surfaces (from the pictures) are all homeomorphic to the torus. The key properties for a torus are genus 1, orientable, compact, Euler characteristic 0. So the assumptions would need to relate to these properties for each picture.\n\nBut since the user can't count genus, the answer might involve checking other properties like Euler characteristic or the fundamental group. But again, without specific images, the assumptions have to be generic.\n\nGiven the example provided in the user's instruction, the assumptions should list specific conditions. For the torus problem, possible assumptions could be:\n\n- Each surface represented is compact and orientable.\n- Each surface has an Euler characteristic of 0.\n- Each surface can be constructed by identifying opposite sides of a quadrilateral without twists.\n\nBut since the original question is about images that are portions of a torus, maybe the assumptions are about the way the portions are embedded or glued. However, this is speculative.\n\nIn the end, the formatted problem should have assumptions that each picture satisfies certain conditions (like being a compact orientable surface with genus 1 or Euler characteristic 0), and the problem is to prove they are tori. Given the lack of images, I'll proceed with the most common approach to such problems: using Euler characteristic and orientability.",
