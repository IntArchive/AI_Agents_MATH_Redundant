    "Content": "Can someone tell me if I got the following right: Assume $X$ to be a normed vector space over $\\mathbb{R}$. Prove that if the dual space $X^\\ast$ is separable then $X$ is separable as well. I'm supposed to use the following hint: First show that for each $x_n^\\ast$ we may choose a unit vector $x_n \\in X$ such that $x_n^\\ast (x_n) \\geq \\frac{\\| x_n^\\ast \\|}{2}$. Then show that $\\overline{Y} = \\overline{span_\\mathbb{Q} \\{ x_n\\}} = X$. My answer: (i) (by contradiction) Assume for all $x_n \\in X$ with $\\| x_n \\|_X = 1$ that $$x_n^\\ast (x_n) < \\frac{\\| x_n^\\ast \\|}{2} \\iff 2 x_n^\\ast (x_n) < \\sup_{x_n; \\| x_n \\|_X = 1 } \\{ | x_n^\\ast(x_n) | \\}$$ Claim: Then $\\exists r \\in \\mathbb{R}: x_n^\\ast(x_n) < r < \\sup_{\\dots}\\{\\dots \\}$: (i) $x_n^\\ast (x_n) \\neq 0$: because $\\| x_n \\| = 1$ and $x_n^\\ast$ linear (ii) if $x_n^\\ast (x_n) < 0$ then \n$2 x_n^\\ast (x_n) < x_n^\\ast (x_n) < x_n^\\ast(- x_n) < 2 x_n^\\ast(-x_n) < \\sup_{\\dots} \\{ \\dots \\}$ (iii) $x_n^\\ast(x_n) > 0$ then $\\forall x_n: x_n^\\ast (x_n) < 2 x_n^\\ast (x_n) < \\sup$ $\\implies $ the $\\sup$ is not the l.u.b., contradiction, so the claim $x_n^\\ast (x_n) \\geq \\frac{\\| x_n^\\ast \\|}{2}$ is true. (ii) Using: $ x \\in \\overline{Y} \\iff \\lnot \\exists $ bounded linear functional $f^\\ast$ such that $f^\\ast (y ) = 0 \\forall y \\in Y$ and $f^\\ast (x) \\neq 0$ Let $f^\\ast \\in X^\\ast$. Then $\\{ x_n^\\ast \\}$ dense in $X^\\ast \\implies$ $$ \\forall \\varepsilon > 0 \\exists x_n^\\ast : \\| x_n^\\ast - f^\\ast \\| = \\sup_{x \\in X: \\| x \\| \\leq 1} \\{ |x_n^\\ast (x) - f^\\ast(x)| \\} < \\varepsilon$$ But for $x_n \\in Y \\subset X (\\| x_n \\| = 1)$ we know \n$$| x_n^\\ast (x_n)| \\geq x_n^\\ast (x_n) \\geq \\frac{\\| x_n \\|}{2} > 0$$ so if $f^\\ast (y) = 0 \\forall y \\in Y$ then $$ 0 < \\frac{\\| x_n \\|}{2} \\leq |x_n^\\ast (x_n)| = |x_n^\\ast (x_n) - f^\\ast(x_n)|$$ $$ \\implies \\exists \\varepsilon: \\sup |x_n^\\ast (x_n) - f^\\ast(x_n)| > \\varepsilon$$ $$ \\implies \\lnot \\exists f^\\ast \\in X^\\ast : \\forall y \\in Y: f^\\ast (y) = 0$$ $$ x \\in \\overline{Y}$$ Thanks for your help.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "To cut a long story short: I don't really follow what you're doing in “(i) (by contradiction)” because the notation is quite confusing, but the argument for “(ii) Using:...” is basically okay, even if only barely readable. A few remarks: You don't say what $\\{x_{n}^\\ast\\}_{n=1}^\\infty$ is. Clearly, there is the implicit assumption that $D = \\{x_{n}^\\ast\\}_{n=1}^\\infty$ is a countable norm-dense subset of the Banach space dual $X^\\ast$ of $X$. Always state what you assume! For instance, your choice of $Y$ later on indicates that you work with a real Banach space (who should know that this is assumed if you don't state it?) Fix $n$. By definition of the norm on $X^\\ast$ we have\n$$\n\\|x_{n}^\\ast\\|_{X^\\ast} = \\sup_{\\Vert x\\Vert=1} |x_{n}^\\ast (x)|.\n$$\nThe definition of the supremum provides us with an $x$ such that $\\|x\\| = 1$ and $\\|x_{n}^\\ast\\|_{X^\\ast} \\geq |x_{n}^\\ast(x)| \\geq \\|x_{n}^\\ast\\|_{X^\\ast} / 2$ (if $x_{n}^\\ast = 0$ take any $x$ with $\\|x\\| = 1$). Multiplying $x$ with an appropriate scalar $\\lambda = e^{i\\alpha}$ (or $\\pm 1$ if indeed we work over the reals), we can put $x_n = \\lambda x$ in order to get $x_{n}^\\ast(x_n) \\geq \\|x_{n}^\\ast\\|_{X^\\ast}/2$. Do this for every $n$ to get a set $S = \\{x_n\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\subset X$ such that for each $n$ we have $\\|x_{n}\\|_{X} = 1$ and $x_{n}^\\ast(x_n) \\geq \\|x_{n}^\\ast\\|_{X^\\ast}/2$. This takes care of your point (i). Let $S =\\{x_n\\}_{n=1}^\\infty \\subset X$ be the set chosen in 2 and let $Y=\\operatorname{span}_{\\mathbb{Q}}\\,{S} \\subset X$ be the set of rational linear combinations of elements of $S$ (if we should happen to work over the conplex numbers take $\\mathbb{Q}+i\\mathbb{Q}$ instead of $\\mathbb{Q}$). Then $Y$ is countable (say that!). We want to show that $Y$ is dense in $X$, so that $X$ is indeed separable. Note that the closure $\\overline{Y}$ of $Y$ is a linear subspace of $X$ (why is that?). Assume towards a contradiction that $\\overline{Y}$ is not all of $X$. By Hahn-Banach we can find a continuous linear functional $0 \\neq x^\\ast \\in X^\\ast$ such that $x^\\ast|_\\overline{Y} = 0$. By norm-density of $D$ in $X^\\ast$, we can find an $x_{n}^\\ast$ in $D$ such that $\\Vert x^\\ast - x_{n}^\\ast \\Vert_{X^\\ast} \\lt 1/4$ . Because $x_n$ is in $\\overline{Y}$ we have $x^\\ast(x_n) = 0$ and thus\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} \\leq |x_{n}^\\ast(x_n)| = |x_{n}^\\ast(x_n) - x^\\ast(x_n)| \\leq \\Vert x_{n}^\\ast- x^\\ast\\Vert_{X^\\ast} \\, \\|x_{n}\\| \\lt \\frac14,\n$$\nwhich is a contradiction. Done. Note. I'm not sure if that was a typo, but actually we don't need the extra argument in 2. where we show that we can find $x_n$ such that $x_{n}^\\ast(x_n) \\geq \\|x_{n}^\\ast\\|/2$ (without modulus signs). You start the proof of (ii) by saying “Then $\\{x_n\\}$ dense in $X$” — wait, what?! are you assuming what you want to prove? — Ah, no, okay, you mean $\\{x_{n}^\\ast\\}$ dense in $X^\\ast$. pheew . You then conclude the argument more or less the same way as I did but your exaggerated formalism makes this extremely hard to follow. Finally, a few things I have told you over and over again: Get rid of all the symbols: $\\forall, \\exists, \\implies, \\iff, \\lnot$ when you're writing stuff. They are unpleasant to look at and hard to decipher. Write prose. Use formulas only when you absolutely need them. Please make complete, grammatically correct sentences. There is not a single complete sentence in your whole solution! The idea of point 1. is that it forces you to observe point 2. and if you observe point 2. you are forced to eliminate all the quantifiers, implication sings and other logical symbols from your writing. Please do have a look at J. Milne's page: Tips for authors. D. Goss: Some Hints on Mathematical Style based on tips by Serre.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is asking to prove that if the dual space X* of a normed vector space X is separable, then X itself is separable. They mentioned using a specific hint: first choosing unit vectors x_n in X such that the dual elements x_n* evaluated at x_n are at least half the norm of x_n*, then showing that the closure of the span over Q of these x_n is the whole space X.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The problem states that X is a normed vector space over R. The key assumption is that X* is separable. The user's approach involves constructing a countable dense subset in X by using the separability of X* and the Hahn-Banach theorem, perhaps. \n\nIn the original problem, the user wrote their own attempt, but the task here is just to structure the problem as per the given format. So the assumptions would include that X is a normed vector space over R, the dual X* is separable, and perhaps the existence of those unit vectors x_n satisfying x_n*(x_n) ≥ ||x_n*|| / 2. However, the user's own reasoning might include steps they took, but the actual problem's assumptions are just the conditions given for the theorem to hold. So the problem's main assumption is that X* is separable, and X is a real normed space. The problem is to prove X is separable.\n\nWait, the example given in the original instruction had the user include assumptions line by line, each addressing one property. In the example, the user included that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem statement, the problem was to prove for every integer n, the expression is divisible by 91. However, the formatted problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. Formatted assumption lists n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7; it's for every integer n. That example seems to have an error. Maybe the user made a mistake there. But regardless, in the current problem, the user is supposed to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question provided.\n\nThe Math Stack Exchange question is: Prove that X* separable implies X separable. The user provided their own answer attempt, but we need to extract the problem's assumptions and the problem statement. The problem's assumptions are that X is a normed vector space over R, and X* is separable. The problem is to prove that X is separable. The hint given is part of the problem setup but may not be part of the assumptions. So the assumptions are:\n\n- X is a normed vector space over ℝ.\n- The dual space X* is separable.\n\nThe problem is to prove that X is separable.\n\nWait, in the example, they listed two assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7, but the original problem was for every integer n. That seems contradictory. Maybe the example was incorrect, but the user wants to follow that format. But in the current problem, the only explicit assumptions given are that X is a normed vector space over R, and X* is separable. So in this case, the assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a normed vector space over ℝ,\nX* is separable.\n\nProblem:\nProve that X is separable.\n\nBut wait, the user's original question includes their own attempt, but the task is to structure the problem as per the example. The example included assumptions that may have been part of the problem or part of the solution. Wait, looking back, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. That seems like a mistake. Perhaps the user intended to include necessary conditions or perhaps there was an error. Therefore, perhaps in the current problem, we need to be careful not to include unnecessary assumptions.\n\nBut according to the user's instruction, the assumptions should list all the problem's conditions. The problem here is to prove that if X* is separable, then X is separable. The given context is X is a normed vector space over ℝ. So the assumptions are:\n\n1. X is a normed vector space over ℝ.\n2. The dual space X* is separable.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list these two assumptions and the problem statement is to prove X is separable.\n\nThe user's own answer attempt includes some steps, like choosing x_n with unit norm such that x_n*(x_n) ≥ ||x_n*|| / 2, but those are part of the solution, not the problem's assumptions. The problem's assumptions are just the given conditions for the theorem. Therefore, the correct formatting should be:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a normed vector space over ℝ,\nX* is separable.\n\nProblem:\nProve that X is separable.\n\nYes, that makes sense. The original problem statement says \"Prove that if the dual space X* is separable then X is separable as well.\" So the assumptions are X is a real normed space, X* is separable, and the problem is to prove X is separable.",
