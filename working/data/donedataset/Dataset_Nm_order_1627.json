    "Content": "Let $G$ be a finite group and $\\chi$ a character of $G$. The values of $\\chi$ generate an abelian Galois extension $K$ of $\\mathbb{Q}$, and so one can consider the conjugate $\\sigma(\\chi)$ of $\\chi$ by any element $\\sigma$ of the Galois group. What's the shortest way to prove that $\\sigma(\\chi)$ is also a character of $G$? This follows from the fact that the corresponding representation $V$ is realizable over a finite extension of $K$, but this fact is somewhat annoying to prove, and on an exam I don't want to prove it from scratch if I can avoid it. Are there any shorter arguments? Motivation: I'm looking at a representation theory exam question (for practice) which asks me to fill out a character table. If I could assume the above statement, I could conclude that the missing characters are integer-valued.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "OK, I've thought about it a bit more and I'll give an alternate proof below the first horizontal line. However, I highly deny that this proof is better, and I am not sure it is actually shorter.\nTo my mind, the morally correct proof is to show that, if $K \\subseteq L$ with $L$ algebraically closed, and a system of polynomial equations has a root in $L$, then it has a root in a finite extension of $K$. The point, which I am sure Qiaochu understands, is that he only knows a priori that the representation is defined over $\\mathbb{C}$. Once he knows that the representation is definable over an algebraic extension $K'$ of $K$, he can replace $K'$ by its normal closure, note that $\\mathrm{Gal}(K', \\mathbb{Q}) \\to \\mathrm{Gal}(K, \\mathbb{Q})$ is surjective, lift any element $\\sigma$ of  $\\mathrm{Gal}(K, \\mathbb{Q})$ to some $\\tilde{\\sigma}$ in $\\mathrm{Gal}(K', \\mathbb{Q})$, and apply $\\tilde{\\sigma}$ to the entries of his matrices. Part of the problem is that the representation may honestly not be defined over $K$. For example, the two dimensional representation of the quaternion eight group has character with values in $\\mathbb{Q}$, but can't be defined over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Fix $G$ and a representation $V$ of $G$. For $g \\in G$, let $\\lambda_1(g)$, $\\lambda_2(g)$, ..., $\\lambda_n(g)$ be the multiset of eigenvalues of $g$ acting on $V$. These are necessarily roots of unity, since $g^N=1$ for some $N$. For any symmetric polynomial $f$, with integer coefficients, define $\\chi(f,g) = f(\\lambda_1(g), \\ldots, \\lambda_n(g))$. Lemma: With notation as above, $g \\mapsto \\chi(f,g)$ is a virtual character. Proof: If $f$ is the elementary symmetric function $e_k$, then this is the character of $\\bigwedge^k V$. Any symmetric function is a polynomial (with integer coefficients) in the $e_k$'s; take the corresponding tensor product and formal difference of virtual characters. Any Galois symmetry $\\sigma$ of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_N)$ is of the form $\\zeta_N \\mapsto \\zeta_N^s$, for $s$ relatively prime to $N$. Consider the power sum symmetric function $p_s := \\sum x_i^s$. So $\\chi(p_s, \\ )$ is the Galois conjugate $\\chi^{\\sigma}$, and we now know that it is a virtual character. But $\\langle \\chi^{\\sigma}, \\chi^{\\sigma} \\rangle = \\langle \\chi, \\chi \\rangle =1$, because the inner product is built out of polynomial operations and complex conjugation, and complex conjugation is central in the Galois group. So this virtual character must correspond to $\\pm W$, for some representation $W$. Since $\\chi^{\\sigma}(e) = \\chi(e) = \\dim V$, we conclude that the positive sign is correct. It just occurred to me that actually writing this out for some specific small values of $s$ makes some nonobvious statements about representation theory. For example, if $G$ has odd order and $V$ is a $G$-irrep, then $\\bigwedge^2 V$ has a $G$-equivariant injection into $\\mathrm{Sym}^2 V$. Proof: The difference of their characters is the character of $V^{\\sigma}$, where $\\sigma: \\zeta \\mapsto \\zeta^2$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement from the original question. \n\nThe original question is about proving that the Galois conjugate of a character is still a character of a finite group G. The key elements here are:\n\n- G is a finite group.\n- χ is a character of G.\n- The values of χ generate an abelian Galois extension K over ℚ.\n- σ is an element of the Galois group (so σ is an automorphism of K fixing ℚ).\n- They want to prove that σ(χ) is also a character of G without going into the details of the representation being realizable over a finite extension.\n\nNow, the assumptions need to be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object. Let's parse the question:\n\n1. G is a finite group. (This is stated explicitly.)\n2. χ is a character of G. (Given.)\n3. The values of χ generate an abelian Galois extension K of ℚ. (Mentioned in the problem statement.)\n4. σ is an element of the Galois group (Gal(K/ℚ) presumably, since K is the extension generated by χ's values). \n\nThe problem is to prove that σ(χ) is also a character of G. The user mentions that using the fact about the representation being realizable over a finite extension is annoying and wants a shorter argument, but the formatted problem doesn't need to include the motivation or the exam context, just the core problem.\n\nSo, structuring this:\n\nAssumptions:\n- G is a finite group.\n- χ is a character of G.\n- The values of χ generate an abelian Galois extension K of ℚ.\n- σ is an element of the Galois group of K over ℚ.\n\nProblem: Prove that σ(χ) is also a character of G.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is one line, one property per line. Check if any assumptions are implicit. For example, the Galois group here is of K over ℚ, which is abelian because K is an abelian extension. But maybe the user didn't state that the extension is abelian as a separate assumption, but it's included in the problem statement. Wait, the original problem says \"The values of χ generate an abelian Galois extension K of ℚ\". So that's part of the given conditions. So the abelian nature of the extension is part of the assumption. Therefore, the third assumption includes that K is abelian over ℚ. \n\nSo yes, the assumptions are as above. The problem is to show that the Galois conjugate of χ by σ is still a character. \n\nNow, I need to format this exactly as per the example, using the same structure. Check for any other possible assumptions, but I think those four are the key ones. The problem statement is straightforward. Let me put this into the required format.",
