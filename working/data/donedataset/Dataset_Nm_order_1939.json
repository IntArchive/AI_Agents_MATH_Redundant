    "Content": "I'm stuck on the following problem: Let $f_n$ be a sequence of injective analytic functions on the unit disc $D$ such that $f_n$ converges uniformly to $f$ on compact subsets of $D$.  Show that $f$ is either injective or constant. Already $f$ is analytic as an almost uniform limit.  If $f'$ is identically zero, then $f$ is constant.  Otherwise $f'$ has isolated zeroes.  If $c$ is such an isolated zero, then $f_n'$ converges uniformly to $f'$ on a small disc near $c$.  By Hurwitz's theorem, for almost all $n$ the functions $f_n'$ should also have a zero in that small disc. But an analytic function is locally injective at a point if and only if its derivative at the point is nonzero.  And injective implies locally injective.  So the $f_n'$ shouldn't have any zeros in $D$. So, we can at least conclude that $f'$ is never zero on $D$.  This shows that $f$ is locally injective.  Is there an easy way to conclude injectivity from local injectivity here?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Uniform limit of injective analytic functions is injective, if this limit IS NOT CONSTANT. Proof. Suppose that $f(z)=a$ at two points $z_1,z_2$ . Surround these two points by a Jordan curve $\\gamma$ such that $f(z)\\neq a$ on $\\gamma$ . Then according to the argument principle $$\\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\\int\\frac{f'(z)dz}{f(z)-a}\\geq 2.$$ (The right hand side equals to the number of solutions of $f(z)=a$ inside $\\gamma$ ,\ncounting multiplicity). On the other hand, $f_n(z)\\neq a$ on $\\gamma$ when $n$ is sufficiently large, and the similar integral with $f_n$ instead of $f$ is $\\leq 1$ , because $f_n$ are injective. But this is a contradiction because $f_n\\to f$ uniformly, so integral with $f_n$ must converge to the integral with $f$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me first read through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe title is \"Uniform limit of injective analytic functions is injective\". The question states: Let f_n be a sequence of injective analytic functions on the unit disc D such that f_n converges uniformly to f on compact subsets of D. Show that f is either injective or constant. The user then goes through some reasoning involving Hurwitz's theorem, derivatives, and local injectivity.\n\nMy task is to extract the assumptions and the problem statement from this. The example given in the instruction shows that assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. Let me parse the original question.\n\nFirst, the problem says f_n is a sequence of injective analytic functions on D. So each f_n is injective, and each f_n is analytic on D. Then, f_n converges uniformly to f on compact subsets of D. The conclusion to show is that f is either injective or constant.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n1. Each f_n is an injective function.\n2. Each f_n is analytic on the unit disc D.\n3. The sequence f_n converges uniformly to f on compact subsets of D.\n\nThese are three separate assumptions. Each applies to the same object (f_n) but different properties: injectivity, analyticity, and convergence. The problem is to show that the limit function f is either injective or constant.\n\nWait, but in the original problem statement, the user also mentions some steps they took, like f being analytic, using Hurwitz's theorem, derivatives, etc. But those are part of their thought process, not the problem's assumptions. The actual problem's assumptions are just the ones given in the problem statement: the sequence of injective analytic functions converging uniformly on compact subsets.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n- Each f_n is injective,\n- Each f_n is analytic on the unit disc D,\n- f_n converges uniformly to f on compact subsets of D.\n\nProblem: Show that f is either injective or constant.\n\nBut wait, the original problem's statement might have more details. Let me check again.\n\nThe problem is: \"Let f_n be a sequence of injective analytic functions on the unit disc D such that f_n converges uniformly to f on compact subsets of D. Show that f is either injective or constant.\"\n\nSo the assumptions are exactly those three points. The user's own reasoning about f', Hurwitz's theorem, local injectivity, etc., are part of their solution attempt, which we don't include in the problem formatting.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nEach f_n is an injective function,\nEach f_n is analytic on the unit disc D,\nThe sequence f_n converges uniformly to f on compact subsets of D.\n\nProblem: Show that f is either injective or constant.\n\nWait, but in the example given by the user, the assumption included specific conditions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". However, in the original problem here, the only conditions are on f_n and their convergence. So the three assumptions listed above are correct.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is a single line, addressing one property of one object. Each f_n is injective (one property), each f_n is analytic (another property), and the sequence converges uniformly on compact subsets (third property). So three assumptions.\n\nYes, that seems right. The problem is to show the conclusion about f being injective or constant.\n\nThe user in their original question also added some thoughts, but those are not part of the problem's assumptions. So the formatted answer should only include the given assumptions and the problem statement.",
