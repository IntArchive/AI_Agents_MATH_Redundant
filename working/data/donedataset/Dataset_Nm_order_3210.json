    "Content": "I can't quite figure out this problem Weibel 1.4.1: Show that acyclic bounded below chain complexes of free R-modules are always split exact. I can see that at the end of the chain, we have\n$$\\cdots \\to C_1 \\xrightarrow{d_1} C_0 \\to 0$$\nwith $C_0$ free, so the short exact sequence\n$$0 \\to {\\ker d_1}\\to C_1 \\xrightarrow{d_1} C_0 \\to 0$$\nsplits. But without assuming, say that R is a PID (so that $\\ker d_1$ is free itself), I don't see how I can keep splitting every such short exact sequence for larger n. Also, for the second part of the question, Weibel asks Show that an acyclic chain complex of finitely generated free abelian\ngroups is always split exact, even when it is not bounded below. I think the proof relies on that submodules of f.g. free abelian groups are free. But in that case, we can just assume we are working with R-modules for a PID R? In addition, is the f.g. restriction just to avoid using well-ordering/AC?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "For the first question: $\\text{ker}(d_1)$ might not be free, but as a summand of $C_1$ , it is projective. Now use $\\text{ker}(d_1)=\\text{im}(d_2)$ and continue the splitting process. For the second question: You're completely right. The point is that all syzygies of the complex are projective again, and the restriction to f.g. modules is probably only to avoid use of AC. Note also that one can do with much weaker assumptions: it suffices to have a ring of finite global dimension. The simplest example of an acyclic complex of free modules that is not contractible is probably $$...\\xrightarrow{\\cdot x} k[x]/(x^2)\\xrightarrow{\\cdot x} k[x]/(x^2)\\xrightarrow{\\cdot x}...$$ over the ring $k[x]/(x^2)$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem from Weibel's book. The user wants me to structure the problem according to the specified format, so I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement from the original question. \n\nFirst, the original question is about showing that acyclic bounded below chain complexes of free R-modules are always split exact. Then there's a second part about acyclic complexes of finitely generated free abelian groups even when not bounded below.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the Assumptions section lists each condition applied to one object. For the first part, the key points are: the chain complex is acyclic, bounded below, and each module is free. The second part adds finitely generated and free abelian groups, without the bounded below condition.\n\nSo for the first problem:\nAssumptions:\n- The chain complex is acyclic.\n- The chain complex is bounded below.\n- Each R-module in the chain complex is free.\n\nProblem: Show that the chain complex is split exact.\n\nFor the second part:\nAssumptions:\n- The chain complex is acyclic.\n- Each module in the chain complex is a finitely generated free abelian group.\n- The chain complex is not necessarily bounded below.\n\nProblem: Show that the chain complex is split exact.\n\nWait, but the original question mentions \"even when it is not bounded below\". So the second problem removes the bounded below condition but adds finitely generated free abelian groups. Since abelian groups are modules over ℤ, which is a PID, that might be why the second part works without being bounded below. So the key assumptions for the second part are the modules are finitely generated free abelian groups, the complex is acyclic, and it's not bounded below.\n\nNeed to check if the original problem mentions the second part as a separate problem. The user's question says: \"Weibel asks Show that an acyclic chain complex of finitely generated free abelian groups is always split exact, even when it is not bounded below.\" So the second problem has different assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the user probably wants both parts formatted. But in the example, only one problem was formatted. However, the original user instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\". So perhaps each part is a separate problem.\n\nBut the user's example included two parts? Wait, no, in the example, the original problem had two parts but the formatted problem only addressed the first. Wait, the example given by the user was:\n\nOriginal problem:\nProve that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but in that example, the original problem didn't mention that n is divisible by 7, but the formatted problem added it as an assumption. That seems incorrect. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in their example? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\", which changes the problem. But maybe that was an intentional mistake for the example. Anyway, I need to follow the user's instructions as per their example, which seems to extract the assumptions from the problem, even if they are not explicitly stated. Wait, no. The example might be incorrect, but according to the user's instruction, the task is to filter the unrelated information and structure the problem. So perhaps in the original problem, there was an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the user's example incorrectly added it. Hmm, confusing.\n\nBut perhaps the user wants to list all the assumptions present in the problem. In the example, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is \"n is an integer\". But the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original. That seems like an error. Wait, maybe the user intended to show that in their example, they mistakenly included an extra assumption. So perhaps the user wants the assistant to extract the assumptions from the original problem as written, not to add new ones. But in their example, they added an assumption not present. That's confusing. Maybe the user's example is wrong, but the instruction says to structure the problem as per the example. So perhaps the assistant should list all conditions given in the problem, even if they are not explicitly stated as assumptions. \n\nLooking back at the current problem: the user's question on Math Stack Exchange is about Weibel 1.4.1. The problem has two parts. The first part: Show that acyclic bounded below chain complexes of free R-modules are always split exact. The second part: Show that an acyclic chain complex of finitely generated free abelian groups is always split exact, even when not bounded below.\n\nSo for the first problem, the assumptions are:\n- The chain complex is acyclic.\n- The chain complex is bounded below.\n- Each R-module in the complex is free.\n\nProblem: Show that the chain complex is split exact.\n\nFor the second problem:\n- The chain complex is acyclic.\n- Each module is a finitely generated free abelian group.\n- The chain complex is not bounded below (but the problem says \"even when it is not bounded below\", so perhaps the assumption is that it's not bounded below, but the problem is to show it's split exact regardless of being bounded below. Wait, the problem says \"Show that an acyclic chain complex... is always split exact, even when it is not bounded below\". So the problem is that the chain complex is acyclic, consists of finitely generated free abelian groups, and even when not bounded below, it's split exact. So the assumptions are:\n- The chain complex is acyclic.\n- Each module is a finitely generated free abelian group.\n- The chain complex may or may not be bounded below (but the problem is stating that even when not bounded below, it's split exact. So perhaps the assumption is that it's not necessarily bounded below. But the problem is to show that regardless of being bounded below, it's split exact. But how to phrase that as assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to show that even when not bounded below, it's split exact. So the problem includes both cases: bounded below or not. But the key point is that the chain complex is not required to be bounded below. So the assumptions would be:\n- The chain complex is acyclic.\n- Each module is a finitely generated free abelian group.\n- The chain complex is not bounded below. (But the problem says \"even when it is not bounded below\", which might mean that even in the case when it's not bounded below, it's split exact. So maybe the problem is to consider chain complexes that may or may not be bounded below, but the user's problem is to show that even without the bounded below condition, given that the modules are finitely generated free abelian groups, it's split exact. So the assumption is that the complex is acyclic and consists of f.g. free abelian groups, and the problem is to show split exactness without assuming bounded below.\n\nBut in the problem statement, it says \"even when it is not bounded below\", which implies that the chain complex might not be bounded below, but the conclusion still holds. So the assumptions are that it's acyclic, modules are f.g. free abelian groups, and the complex is not bounded below. Wait, but the problem says \"even when it is not bounded below\", so perhaps the problem is to show that even if it's not bounded below, as long as it's acyclic and modules are f.g. free abelian, then split exact. So the assumptions would include that the complex is acyclic, modules are f.g. free abelian groups, and it is not bounded below.\n\nBut the problem says \"Show that an acyclic chain complex of finitely generated free abelian groups is always split exact, even when it is not bounded below.\" So the \"even when\" suggests that the split exactness holds regardless of being bounded below. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The chain complex is acyclic.\n- Each module is a finitely generated free abelian group.\n- The chain complex may or may not be bounded below.\n\nBut the problem is to show that even when not bounded below, it's split exact. So the key is that the split exactness holds even without the bounded below condition. Therefore, the problem is to show split exactness under the assumptions of acyclic and f.g. free abelian groups, without assuming bounded below. Therefore, the assumptions for the second problem would be:\n\n- The chain complex is acyclic.\n- Each module is a finitely generated free abelian group.\n\nProblem: Show that the chain complex is split exact, even when it is not bounded below.\n\nBut how to phrase the \"even when\" part. The problem is to show that despite not being bounded below, it's split exact. But the non-boundedness is not an assumption but a condition that doesn't affect the conclusion. Wait, perhaps the problem is structured as: under the assumptions of acyclic and f.g. free abelian groups, the complex is split exact, even if it is not bounded below. So the \"even when\" is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Therefore, the assumptions are just the first two, and the problem includes the \"even when\" part.\n\nSo for the second part:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The chain complex is acyclic.\n- Each module is a finitely generated free abelian group.\n\nProblem: Show that the chain complex is split exact, even when it is not bounded below.\n\nBut the user's example included an assumption that was not in the original problem (the n divisible by 7), but perhaps in the current case, the problem does mention \"bounded below\" as a condition for the first part and removes it for the second. So the first problem's assumptions include bounded below, and the second does not. Therefore, for the first problem:\n\nAssumption:\n- The chain complex is acyclic.\n- The chain complex is bounded below.\n- Each R-module in the chain complex is free.\n\nProblem: Show that the chain complex is split exact.\n\nSecond problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The chain complex is acyclic.\n- Each module in the chain complex is a finitely generated free abelian group.\n\nProblem: Show that the chain complex is split exact, even when it is not bounded below.\n\nBut in the original problem, the second part is stated as \"Show that an acyclic chain complex of finitely generated free abelian groups is always split exact, even when it is not bounded below.\" So the problem is to show split exactness under the assumptions of acyclic and f.g. free abelian groups, even without the bounded below condition. Therefore, the assumptions are the first two, and the problem includes the \"even when\" as part of the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, structuring as per the user's example, each problem part is treated separately. So the user's original question contains two problems: the first with bounded below and free R-modules, the second with f.g. free abelian groups and not necessarily bounded below.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problems would be two separate entries. But according to the user's format example, they only listed one problem. However, the user's instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\", implying each problem should be formatted separately. The original question has two problems, so perhaps the answer should format both.\n\nBut the user's example only formatted one problem. Maybe the user wants each part as a separate formatted problem. So for the answer, I need to present both.\n\nBut the user's initial instruction says \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" The original question includes two parts, so both should be formatted.\n\nBut in the example, the user only formatted one problem. However, the example may be incomplete. Given that, perhaps the assistant should format each part as a separate problem.\n\nSo the final answer would be:\n\nFor the first problem:\nAssumption:\n- The chain complex is acyclic.\n- The chain complex is bounded below.\n- Each R-module in the chain complex is free.\n\nProblem: Show that the chain complex is split exact.\n\nFor the second problem:\nAssumption:\n- The chain complex is acyclic.\n- Each module in the chain complex is a finitely generated free abelian group.\n- The chain complex is not bounded below.\n\nProblem: Show that the chain complex is split exact.\n\nWait, but the second problem's original statement says \"even when it is not bounded below\", which suggests that the split exactness holds even if it's not bounded below. So the problem is to show split exactness without assuming bounded below. Therefore, the assumption is that the complex is acyclic and the modules are f.g. free abelian groups, and the problem is to show split exactness regardless of being bounded below. So the \"even when\" is part of the problem statement, not an assumption.\n\nTherefore, for the second problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The chain complex is acyclic.\n- Each module in the chain complex is a finitely generated free abelian group.\n\nProblem: Show that the chain complex is split exact, even when it is not bounded below.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could include the \"not bounded below\" as part of the problem statement, not an assumption. So the assumption is only the first two, and the problem includes the rest.\n\nTherefore, the formatted answer would be two separate problems.",
