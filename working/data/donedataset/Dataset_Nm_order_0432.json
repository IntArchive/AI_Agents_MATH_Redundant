    "Content": "Let $A,B\\in M_{n}(\\mathbb{Q})$. If $(A-B)^2=AB$, prove that $\\det(AB-BA)=0$. I considered the function $f:\\mathbb{Q}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{Q}$, $f(x)=\\det(A^2+B^2-BA-xAB)$ and I obtained that:\n$$f(0)=\\det(A^2+B^2-BA)=\\det(2AB)=2^n\\det(AB)$$\n$$f(1)=\\det(A^2+B^2-BA-AB)=\\det((A-B)^2)=\\det(AB)$$\n$$f(2)=\\det(A^2+B^2-BA-2AB)=\\det((A-B)^2-AB)=\\det(AB-AB)=0$$ I don't have any other idea.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The idea is to use $(-3\\pm\\sqrt 5)/2$ .  We begin with $$\\begin{align}\n(A+xB)(A+x'B) &= A^2 + x BA + x' AB + xx' B^2 \\\\ &= A^2 + (x' + x) AB+x(BA-AB)+xx'B^2.\\end{align}\n$$ Now we find numbers $x$ , $x'$ such that $x'+x  = -3$ , $xx'=1$ . \nThese numbers are the roots of the quadratic equation $$\n\\lambda^2 +3\\lambda +1 = 0.\n$$ Thus, we have $x = \\frac{-3+\\sqrt 5}2$ and $x'= \\frac{-3-\\sqrt 5}2$ . With these, we have $$\\begin{align}\n(A+xB)(A+x'B) &= A^2 -3AB + B^2 + x(BA-AB) \\\\ &= BA-AB + x(BA-AB) = (BA-AB)(1+x).\\end{align}\n$$ We now have that $$\n\\det(A+xB)(A+x'B) =q \\in \\mathbb{Q},\n$$ and $$\nq=(1+x)^n \\det(BA-AB).\n$$ Then it follows by $A, B\\in M_n(\\mathbb{Q})$ and $(1+x)^n\\in\\mathbb{R} \\backslash \\mathbb{Q}$ that $\\det(BA-AB)=0$ . An example with $AB\\neq BA$ For the example that @Jonas Meyer requested, here it is: $$\nA=\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{-3+\\sqrt 5}2\\end{pmatrix}, \\ \\ B=\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{3+\\sqrt 5}2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & -1\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$ Then $$\nA-B= \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{-1-\\sqrt 5}2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{-1+\\sqrt 5}2\\end{pmatrix},$$ $$\n(A-B)^2 = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{3+\\sqrt 5}2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{3-\\sqrt 5}2\\end{pmatrix} = AB.\n$$ But, $$\nBA =\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{3+\\sqrt 5}2 & \\sqrt 5 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{3-\\sqrt 5}2\\end{pmatrix} \\neq AB.\n$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's take a look at this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to parse the original problem and identify all the assumptions and the main problem statement.\n\nThe original title is: \"If $(A-B)^2=AB$, prove that $\\det(AB-BA)=0$.\" The question body mentions that $A$ and $B$ are matrices in $M_{n}(\\mathbb{Q})$, which means they are square matrices of size $n$ with rational entries. The key condition given is $(A - B)^2 = AB$, and the goal is to prove that the determinant of $AB - BA$ is zero.\n\nNow, looking at the example provided, the assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. Here, the main assumptions are:\n\n1. $A$ and $B$ are $n \\times n$ matrices over the rational numbers.\n2. The equation $(A - B)^2 = AB$ holds.\n\nThese are the only two assumptions. The problem statement is to prove that $\\det(AB - BA) = 0$. The user's attempt involved defining a function $f(x)$ and computing it at several points, but since we're only formatting the problem, that part isn't needed here.\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is a single line addressing one property. The first assumption is about the matrices being in $M_n(\\mathbb{Q})$, so that's one line. The second is the equation given. The problem is straightforward as stated. I should check if there are any hidden assumptions, but the problem doesn't mention anything else. So the formatted version should have those two assumptions and the problem statement.",
