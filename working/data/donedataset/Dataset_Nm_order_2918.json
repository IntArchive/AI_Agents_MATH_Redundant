    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem step by step. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format with Assumptions and Problem. \n\nFirst, looking at the original question. The title is \"Null space for $AA^{T}$ is the same as Null space for $A^{T}$\". Then, the problem statement says that $A$ is an $n \\times m$ matrix, and $AA^T$ is symmetric. They also mention that the rank of $AA^T$ is $r$, and they question if this equals the rank of $A$. Then, they define $Q$ as a basis for the Null space of $AA^T$, consisting of vectors $q_1, ..., q_{n-r}$, and they want to show that $A^T q_i = 0$. The user's own thought is about the inclusion of null spaces and the rank equality.\n\nWait, the original problem is to show that the null space of $AA^T$ is the same as that of $A^T$. But in the problem statement, they are given a basis for the null space of $AA^T$ and need to show that $A^T q_i = 0$. So effectively, they need to show that if $AA^T q_i = 0$, then $A^T q_i = 0$, which would imply that the null space of $AA^T$ is contained within the null space of $A^T$. Since the reverse inclusion (null space of $A^T$ is contained in that of $AA^T$) is straightforward, this would establish equality.\n\nBut according to the user's example, assumptions need to list each condition applied to one object. Let's extract assumptions from the problem:\n\n1. $A$ is an $n \\times m$ matrix. (This is given.)\n2. $AA^T$ is a symmetric real matrix. (But actually, any matrix multiplied by its transpose is symmetric, so this might be inherent. However, the problem states it, so we should include it as an assumption.)\n3. $\\operatorname{rank}(AA^T) = r$. (Given.)\n4. $Q = \\{ q_1, ..., q_{n - r} \\}$ is a basis for the Null space of $AA^T$. (Given, so each $q_i$ satisfies $AA^T q_i = 0$.)\n\nThe problem is to show that $A^T q_i = 0$ for each $i$, which would prove that the null space of $AA^T$ is contained in the null space of $A^T$, and combined with the reverse inclusion, they are equal.\n\nBut the user also mentions questioning whether $\\operatorname{rank}(A) = \\operatorname{rank}(AA^T)$. If that's part of the problem, but in the original question, the problem is to show $A^T q_i = 0$. Wait, let me check the original problem again.\n\nOriginal problem as per user's input:\n\n\"Let $A$ is an $n\\times m$ matrix and $AA^{T}$ is a symmetric real matrix. Also, we have: $\\operatorname{rank}(AA^{T})=r\\stackrel{?}{=}\\operatorname{rank}(A)$. Let $Q= \\begin{Bmatrix} q_1,...,q_{n-r} \\end{Bmatrix}$ be a basis for the Null space of $AA^{T}$. i.e. $AA^{T}q_i=0$, show that $A^{T}q_i=0$.\"\n\nSo the problem statement includes two parts: first, whether $r = \\operatorname{rank}(A)$, and second, to show that $A^T q_i = 0$. But in the example provided by the user, they extracted assumptions and the problem. So perhaps the problem here is to show that $A^T q_i = 0$, given the assumptions. The rank equality might be a part of the problem or a separate question. However, in the user's example, the assumption included that $n$ is divisible by 7, even though the original problem didn't state that. Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like an error. Wait, no, the original problem in the example was to prove divisibility by 91, which is 13*7. The user's formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was not in the original problem. That seems incorrect. Wait, perhaps the example was a mistake. But according to the user's example, they transformed the original problem into an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But the original problem was for every integer n. So maybe the example is wrong. But regardless, the user wants me to structure the current problem as per their format.\n\nLooking at the current problem: The problem as stated in the user's input has a title and a question. The title says the null spaces are the same. The question body says A is n x m, AA^T is symmetric (which is always true), rank(AA^T) = r, and asks if r equals rank(A). Then, given Q is a basis for Null(AA^T), show that A^T q_i = 0.\n\nSo the problem has two parts: first, confirming rank(A) = rank(AA^T), and second, showing that the null space of AA^T is contained in the null space of A^T. But the way the problem is presented, maybe the main task is to show A^T q_i = 0, and the rank equality is a step towards that.\n\nBut according to the user's format, the assumptions are all the given conditions. Let me list them:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n1. $A$ is an $n \\times m$ matrix.\n2. $AA^T$ is a symmetric real matrix. (Though redundant, since $AA^T$ is always symmetric, but since the problem states it, include it)\n3. $\\operatorname{rank}(AA^T) = r$.\n4. $Q = \\{ q_1, \\ldots, q_{n - r} \\}$ is a basis for the Null space of $AA^T$.\n5. For each $q_i \\in Q$, $AA^T q_i = 0$.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is to show two things: first, that rank(A) = r (since the user has a question mark over the equality), and second, that $A^T q_i = 0$. However, in the problem statement, the user writes \"show that $A^T q_i = 0$\", so that is the main problem. The rank equality is posed as a question (with the ?= notation), but it might be part of the assumptions or part of the problem. Wait, the original problem says \"Also, we have: rank(AA^T) = r ?= rank(A)\". So the user is questioning if r equals rank(A). So this might be a part that needs to be proven or is it given? The wording is unclear. The problem says \"we have: rank(AA^T) = r ?= rank(A)\". The question mark over the equals sign suggests that this is a question, i.e., is rank(AA^T) equal to rank(A)? So maybe the problem includes proving that rank(A) = rank(AA^T), and then using that to show that the null spaces are the same.\n\nBut according to the user's instruction, the task is to structure the problem into Assumptions and Problem. So assumptions are the given conditions, and the problem is what needs to be proven.\n\nIn the original problem, the user is to show two things: 1. That rank(AA^T) equals rank(A), and 2. That the null space of AA^T is the same as that of A^T (by showing A^T q_i = 0). But the problem statement is a bit jumbled. Let me parse it again.\n\nThe problem as written:\n\n\"$A$ is an $n\\times m$ matrix and $AA^{T}$ is a symmetric real matrix. Also, we have: $\\operatorname{rank}(AA^{T})=r\\stackrel{?}{=}\\operatorname{rank}(A)$. Let $Q= \\begin{Bmatrix} q_1,...,q_{n-r} \\end{Bmatrix}$ be a basis for the Null space of $AA^{T}$. i.e. $AA^{T}q_i=0$, show that $A^{T}q_i=0$.\"\n\nSo the question is posed in two parts: first, the rank equality is questioned (denoted by ?=), and second, to show that A^T q_i = 0. However, the way the problem is structured, it might be that the user is to show both that rank(A) = r and that A^T q_i =0. But the main imperative is \"show that A^T q_i =0\", while the rank equality is perhaps a sub-question or a step towards the solution.\n\nIn the example provided by the user, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect, unless there was a misinterpretation. However, following the user's example, perhaps the assumptions should list all given conditions, even if they are inherent properties.\n\nSo for the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\n1. $A$ is an $n \\times m$ matrix.\n2. $AA^T$ is a symmetric real matrix.\n3. $\\operatorname{rank}(AA^T) = r$.\n4. $Q = \\{ q_1, \\ldots, q_{n - r} \\}$ is a basis for the Null space of $AA^T$.\n5. For each $q_i \\in Q$, $AA^T q_i = 0$.\n\nThen the problem is two-fold: first, to determine if $r = \\operatorname{rank}(A)$, and second, to show that $A^T q_i = 0$. However, the way the original problem is phrased, the main task is to show $A^T q_i =0$, and the rank equality might be a lemma needed for that. Alternatively, the problem might be only to show $A^T q_i =0$, with the rank equality being part of the assumptions. But the original problem states \"we have: rank(AA^T)=r ?= rank(A)\", which implies that the equality is in question.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the formatted problem extracted the specific assumptions and the problem. In the example, the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7, but the formatted problem included it as an assumption. That seems incorrect, but since the user provided that example, perhaps we should follow that approach. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, the expression is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption included \"n is an integer\", \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that can't be right. The original problem was for all integers n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. This seems like a mistake in the example. So maybe the user made a mistake in their example, but we need to follow their instruction regardless.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example is correct. Let me check: the original problem says \"for every integer n\", and the formatted problem's assumption is \"n is an integer\", \"n is divisible by 7\". But why would they add \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption? The original problem didn't state that. Perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Wait, maybe the original problem was different. If the problem is to prove divisibility by 91, and 91=13*7, then perhaps the user split the problem into assumptions that n is divisible by 7 and 13, but that's not how it's presented. Hmm, this is confusing. Perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user wants us to proceed with their structure regardless.\n\nIn any case, returning to the current problem. The key assumptions are:\n\n- A is n x m matrix\n- AA^T is symmetric (though redundant, as it's always symmetric)\n- rank(AA^T) = r\n- Q is a basis for Null(AA^T), so each q_i is in Null(AA^T)\n\nThe problem is to show that A^T q_i =0 and perhaps to confirm that rank(A)=r.\n\nBut given the user's example, they might have included the rank equality as part of the problem. However, in the original problem, the user wrote \"show that A^T q_i=0\". The question about the rank equality is written with a question mark over the equals sign, indicating it's a question whether they are equal. So the problem has two parts: verify rank equality and show the null space inclusion.\n\nBut according to the user's format, the problem part should be the main task. Since the original question's title is about the null spaces being the same, and the body ends with \"show that A^T q_i=0\", that is the main problem. The rank equality is likely a necessary step to establish the dimensions, but perhaps the formatted problem should only include the showing part, with the assumptions including the rank(AA^T)=r.\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem included an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. But if the user provided that example, maybe they want similar processing here, even if it's incorrect. Alternatively, maybe there was a misunderstanding in the example. For instance, if the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 when n is divisible by 7, but it was miswritten. But without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nGiven that, perhaps we should structure the current problem as:\n\nAssumptions:\n- $A$ is an $n \\times m$ matrix.\n- $AA^T$ is a symmetric real matrix.\n- $\\operatorname{rank}(AA^T) = r$.\n- $Q = \\{ q_1, \\ldots, q_{n - r} \\}$ is a basis for the Null space of $AA^T$.\n- For each $q_i \\in Q$, $AA^T q_i = 0$.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $A^T q_i = 0$ and determine if $r = \\operatorname{rank}(A)$.\n\nBut the original problem mentions the rank equality with a question mark, so it's part of the problem. However, the main imperative is \"show that A^T q_i=0\". The user's own guess mentions that the null space of A^T is a subspace of the null space of AA^T, then the question is why rank(A) = rank(AA^T). So perhaps the problem is to show that the null spaces are equal, which requires showing both inclusions, and the rank equality is part of that.\n\nBut according to the user's instructions, we need to list assumptions and then the problem. The problem as stated in the original question is to show that A^T q_i =0 given the basis for Null(AA^T), and the rank equality is a separate question. However, the problem might be structured as follows:\n\nAssumptions:\n- $A$ is an $n \\times m$ matrix.\n- $AA^T$ is a symmetric real matrix.\n- $\\operatorname{rank}(AA^T) = r$.\n- $Q = \\{ q_1, \\ldots, q_{n - r} \\}$ is a basis for the Null space of $AA^T$.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $A^T q_i = 0$ for each $q_i \\in Q$, and prove that $\\operatorname{rank}(A) = r$.\n\nBut the original problem's main imperative is to show that A^T q_i =0. The rank equality is posed with a question mark, suggesting it's part of what needs to be established. Therefore, perhaps the formatted problem should have the problem as two parts. However, the example provided by the user had only the problem statement, not including the rank equality. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem had the problem as proving divisibility by 91 with the added assumption. So following that, perhaps here the main problem is to show A^T q_i =0, with the assumptions including the rank(AA^T)=r. The rank equality might be a separate part, but the way the original problem is written, it's mentioned in the same sentence with a question mark, which might be part of the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just to show that $A^T q_i = 0$, and the rank equality is a given assumption. But the original problem says \"we have: rank(AA^T)=r ?= rank(A)\". So the user is uncertain if r equals rank(A). Therefore, the problem is to show both that rank(A) = r and that A^T q_i =0.\n\nHowever, in the title of the question, it's stated that the null spaces are the same, which would follow if both inclusions are proven. The reverse inclusion (Null(A^T) subset Null(AA^T)) is straightforward: if A^T q =0, then AA^T q = A(0) =0. The forward inclusion is what needs to be shown: if AA^T q =0, then A^T q =0. Proving this would require that the only vector q such that AA^T q=0 is when A^T q=0. This is equivalent to Null(AA^T) = Null(A^T). For this to hold, the ranks must satisfy certain conditions, which might involve the rank equality.\n\nBut in order to structure this into assumptions and problem, I think the main problem is to show that A^T q_i =0 given that AA^T q_i =0, and the rank equality is a related part. However, the user's example didn't split the problem into multiple parts; it only stated the problem as proving divisibility. So perhaps here, the formatted problem should have the problem as \"Show that $A^T q_i =0$\", with the assumptions including the basis for Null(AA^T) and the rank(AA^T)=r. The rank equality between A and AA^T would then be a consequence or a separate part.\n\nBut the original problem does mention the rank equality with a question mark, so it's part of what needs to be addressed. However, the way the problem is written, after stating the rank(AA^T)=r, they question if it's equal to rank(A), and then proceed to define Q and ask to show A^T q_i=0. So perhaps the problem has two parts: 1. Show rank(A)=r, and 2. Show A^T q_i=0. But the title is about the null spaces being the same, which is equivalent to Null(AA^T)=Null(A^T), which would follow from showing both inclusions and knowing the ranks. But given the user's example, which collapsed multiple conditions into assumptions and the problem, perhaps here we should structure the problem as follows:\n\nAssumptions:\n- $A$ is an $n \\times m$ matrix.\n- $AA^T$ is a symmetric real matrix.\n- $\\operatorname{rank}(AA^T) = r$.\n- $Q = \\{ q_1, \\ldots, q_{n - r} \\}$ is a basis for the Null space of $AA^T$.\n- For each $q_i \\in Q$, $AA^T q_i = 0$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $A^T q_i = 0$ for each $q_i \\in Q$ and determine if $\\operatorname{rank}(A) = r$.\n\nBut in the user's example, the problem was stated as a single statement to prove. Perhaps here, the main problem is to show $A^T q_i=0$, and the rank equality is either an assumption or part of the problem. However, the original problem mentions the rank equality with a question mark, indicating it's part of the problem. Therefore, the formatted problem should include both.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to have the rank equality as an assumption. Let's check the original problem again:\n\nOriginal problem states: \"Also, we have: rank(AA^T}=r ?= rank(A)\". This seems like they are asserting that rank(AA^T)=r and questioning if it equals rank(A). So \"we have\" rank(AA^T)=r, and the question is whether this equals rank(A). Therefore, the assumptions include that rank(AA^T)=r, and the problem includes proving that rank(A)=r and showing A^T q_i=0.\n\nBut the problem's title is about the null spaces being the same, which is addressed by showing A^T q_i=0. The rank equality would follow from the fact that rank(A)=rank(AA^T) for any real matrix A. But perhaps the user is not aware of that, so it's part of the problem.\n\nHowever, in the problem structure, the user wants assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n1. $A$ is an $n \\times m$ matrix.\n2. $AA^T$ is a symmetric real matrix.\n3. $\\operatorname{rank}(AA^T) = r$.\n4. $Q = \\{ q_1, \\ldots, q_{n - r} \\}$ is a basis for the Null space of $AA^T$.\n5. For each $q_i \\in Q$, $AA^T q_i = 0$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $A^T q_i = 0$ for each $q_i \\in Q$ and determine if $\\operatorname{rank}(A) = r$.\n\nBut since in linear algebra, it's a known result that rank(A) = rank(AA^T) for real matrices, this might be part of what needs to be shown. However, in the original problem, the user is questioning this equality, so it's part of the problem.\n\nAlternatively, if we follow the example where an extra condition was added (even incorrectly), perhaps here the rank equality is an assumption. But the original problem does not state that rank(A)=r, it only states rank(AA^T)=r and questions if it equals rank(A). Therefore, the problem must include proving the rank equality.\n\nBut given the user's example, where an assumption was added that wasn't in the original problem, but here, perhaps we should not add extra assumptions. Instead, list the given assumptions and then state the problem as proving the two parts: rank equality and null space inclusion.\n\nHowever, the user's example might have been a mistake, and they actually want to extract the given assumptions without adding new ones. In that case, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. $A$ is an $n \\times m$ matrix.\n2. $AA^T$ is a symmetric real matrix.\n3. $\\operatorname{rank}(AA^T) = r$.\n4. $Q = \\{ q_1, \\ldots, q_{n - r} \\}$ is a basis for the Null space of $AA^T$.\n5. For each $q_i \\in Q$, $AA^T q_i = 0$.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $A^T q_i = 0$ and determine if $\\operatorname{rank}(A) = r$.\n\nBut the problem's title is about the null spaces being the same, so perhaps the main problem is to show that Null(AA^T) = Null(A^T), which involves both inclusions. The forward inclusion is non-trivial and requires showing that if AA^T q_i =0, then A^T q_i=0. The reverse inclusion is trivial. Once that's shown, the null spaces are equal, and their dimensions are the same. Since the dimension of the null space of AA^T is n - r, and the dimension of the null space of A^T is n - rank(A^T). But rank(A^T) = rank(A), so if Null(AA^T) = Null(A^T), then n - r = n - rank(A), implying r = rank(A). Therefore, proving the null spaces are equal would automatically give the rank equality. Hence, the problem can be structured as proving that Null(AA^T) = Null(A^T), which involves showing both inclusions. However, the original problem specifically asks to show A^T q_i=0 given that AA^T q_i=0, which is one direction. The other direction is straightforward.\n\nGiven all that, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumptions:\n1. $A$ is an $n \\times m$ matrix.\n2. $AA^T$ is a symmetric real matrix.\n3. $\\operatorname{rank}(AA^T) = r$.\n4. $Q = \\{ q_1, \\ldots, q_{n - r} \\}$ is a basis for the Null space of $AA^T$.\n5. For each $q_i \\in Q$, $AA^T q_i = 0$.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $A^T q_i = 0$ for each $q_i \\in Q$.\n\nBecause once this is shown, along with the trivial reverse inclusion, the null spaces are equal, and the rank equality follows. The question about rank equality is thus a corollary.\n\nTherefore, the main problem is to show $A^T q_i =0$, with the assumptions listed. The rank equality can be derived from the null space equality, so it's not an explicit part of the problem but rather a consequence.",
