    "Content": "I feel kind of dumb but I needed this little claim as a part of a proof I'm writing, and I figured out that I'd better just ask, since I could not find the correct algebraic manipulation needed in order to prove it. So I want to prove this: Suppose $H$ is an Hilbert space, and $A: H\\to H$ is a linear operator (if that matters, which I believe it does not, we can assume that $A$ is a projection).\nSuppose that for every $x\\in H$, $(Ax,x)=0$. Then $A=0$. What I tried to do is a little bit of Cauchy-Schwarz and some algebra but nothing worked out. Thanks!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "For general operators $A$, the condition $$\\bigl(\\forall x\\in H\\bigr)\\bigl(\\langle Ax,x\\rangle = 0\\bigr)$$ only implies $A = 0$ if $H$ is a $\\mathbb{C}$ vector space, not if $H$ is a $\\mathbb{R}$ vector space. For projections however (or for self-adjoint operators), the implication also holds for real spaces: Pick an $x \\in \\operatorname{im} A$, say $x = Ay$. Then $$0 = \\langle Ax,x\\rangle = \\langle A^2y,Ay\\rangle = \\langle Ay,Ay\\rangle = \\lVert Ay\\rVert^2 = \\lVert x\\rVert^2$$ shows $\\operatorname{im} A = \\{0\\}$. For self-adjoint operators on real inner product spaces or general operators on complex spaces, the proof uses the respective polarisation identity. For self-adjoint operators on real spaces, we have for any $x,y\\in H$ $$0 = \\langle A(x+y),x+y\\rangle - \\langle A(x-y),x-y\\rangle = 2\\langle Ax,y\\rangle + 2\\langle Ay,x\\rangle \\stackrel{\\text{s.a.}}{=}2\\langle Ax,y\\rangle + 2\\langle y,Ax\\rangle = 4\\langle Ax,y\\rangle$$ and hence $Ax = 0$ for all $x$. In the complex case, for all $x,y\\in H$: \\begin{align}\n0 &= \\langle A(x+y),x+y\\rangle - \\langle A(x-y),x-y\\rangle + i\\langle A(x+iy),x+iy\\rangle - i\\langle A(x-iy),x-iy\\rangle\\\\\n&=\\quad \\langle Ax,x\\rangle + \\langle Ax,y\\rangle + \\langle Ay,x\\rangle + \\langle Ay,y\\rangle\\\\\n&\\quad -\\langle Ax,x\\rangle + \\langle Ax,y\\rangle + \\langle Ay,x\\rangle - \\langle Ay,y\\rangle\\\\\n&\\quad +i\\langle Ax,x\\rangle + i\\langle Ax,iy\\rangle + i\\langle Aiy,x\\rangle + i\\langle Aiy,iy\\rangle\\\\\n&\\quad - i\\langle Ax,x\\rangle +i\\langle Ax,iy\\rangle +i\\langle Aiy,x\\rangle -i\\langle Aiy,iy\\rangle\\\\\n&= 2 \\langle Ax,y\\rangle + 2i\\langle Ax,iy\\rangle + 2\\langle Ay,x\\rangle + 2i\\langle Aiy,x\\rangle\\\\\n&= 2\\bigl(\\langle Ax,y\\rangle + i(-i)\\langle Ax,y\\rangle\\bigr) + 2\\bigl(\\langle Ay,x\\rangle + i\\cdot i\\langle Ay,x\\rangle\\bigr)\\\\\n&= 4\\langle Ax,y\\rangle,\n\\end{align} again showing that $Ax = 0$ for all $x\\in H$. (Note: I used the convention that the inner product is linear in the first argument and antilinear in the second; for the other convention, in the penultimate line the signs of the scalar pulled out of the inner product would be opposite, and the end result would be $4\\langle Ay,x\\rangle$, which evidently gives the same conclusion.)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about proving that a linear operator A on a Hilbert space H is the zero operator if the inner product of Ax and x is zero for every x in H. \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The user mentioned that H is a Hilbert space, A is a linear operator from H to H, and for every x in H, the inner product ⟨Ax, x⟩ equals zero. Also, there's a note that they could assume A is a projection but they believe it doesn't matter. However, the problem statement in the title and the main part doesn't specify that A is a projection, so maybe that's just an extra comment. The key assumptions here are:\n\n- H is a Hilbert space.\n- A: H → H is a linear operator.\n- For every x in H, ⟨Ax, x⟩ = 0.\n\nThe problem is to prove that A is the zero operator under these conditions. The example given in the user's instruction included assumptions each on one line, addressing one property per line. So I should list each of these three points as separate assumptions.\n\nWait, but the user also mentioned that the problem might assume A is a projection, but they think it doesn't matter. However, in the actual problem statement, the user wants to prove it without assuming A is a projection. So the projection part is probably just a side note and not part of the actual problem's assumptions. Therefore, the assumptions should only include the Hilbert space, linear operator, and the inner product condition.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nH is a Hilbert space,\nA: H → H is a linear operator,\nFor every x ∈ H, ⟨Ax, x⟩ = 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that A is the zero operator.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is on a separate line, addressing one property each. The Hilbert space is one assumption, the linear operator is another, and the inner product condition is the third. The problem statement is to prove A is zero. That should fit the format correctly.",
