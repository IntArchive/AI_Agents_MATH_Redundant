    "Content": "Let $k$ be a fixed positive number and $n$ an integer increasing to infinity. Then  $$\\sum_{\\nu =0}^n \\binom{n}{\\nu}^k \\sim \\frac{2^{kn}}{\\sqrt{k}} \\left( \\frac{2}{\\pi n} \\right)^{\\frac{k-1}{2}}.$$  This is from Polya's Problems and Theorems in Analysis , Vol. 1, Part II, Problem 40. The proof provided in the book is too simple. It says details can be found in Jordan's Cours d'Analyse , Vol.2, 3rd Ed, pp. 218-221. However, I cannot find this edition online, and what's worse, there is not any English translations. Can anyone give a proof in detail?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "That kind of asymptotics follows from the Central Limit Theorem. If we consider the binomial random variable $X=B(n,1/2)$ as the sum of $n$ independent Bernoulli trials, we have:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[X]=\\frac{n}{4}, \\qquad \\operatorname{Var}[X]=\\frac{n}{4}$$\nfrom which the approximation:\n$$\\frac{1}{2^n}\\binom{n}{n/2+r}\\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n\\pi}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{2r^2}{n}\\right).\\tag{1}$$\nBy considering the $k$-th power of both terms and summing over $r\\in[-n/2,n/2]$ (the main contribute is clearly given by the central binomial coefficient and its neighbours) we get:\n$$\\sum_{r=-n/2}^{n/2}\\binom{n}{n/2+r}^k \\approx 2^{kn}\\left(\\frac{2}{\\pi n}\\right)^{\\frac{k}{2}}\\sum_{r=-n/2}^{n/2}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{2kr^2}{n}\\right)\\tag{2}$$\nand the claim follows from approximating the last sum with:\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{2kx^2}{n}\\right)\\,dx = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi n}{2k}}.\\tag{3}$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the user's format. First, I need to read the original question carefully and identify the key assumptions and the main problem.\n\nThe original problem is about an asymptotic expression for the sum of powers of binomial coefficients. The user mentioned that k is a fixed positive number and n is an integer increasing to infinity. They provided the asymptotic formula and cited Polya's book. The user wants a detailed proof since the one in the book is too brief and the referenced source is not accessible.\n\nSo, breaking down the assumptions: \n\n1. The first assumption is that k is a fixed positive number. That's one condition about k.\n2. Next, n is an integer that increases to infinity. So n is approaching infinity, which is another condition about n.\n3. The sum is from ν=0 to ν=n, so the variable of summation ν ranges over all integers from 0 to n. That's a condition on the summation limits.\n4. The problem states an asymptotic equivalence (~), which is a specific type of approximation as n approaches infinity. This should be noted as part of the problem statement.\n\nWait, the example given by the user in the original problem had assumptions that were specific to the problem. In the example, they listed n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So each assumption is a single property applied to one object. Here, for the current problem, the key points are:\n\n- k is fixed and positive.\n- n is an integer tending to infinity.\n- The sum is over ν from 0 to n.\n- The asymptotic equivalence is part of the problem to prove, not an assumption. So the assumptions are the conditions given, and the problem is to prove the asymptotic formula.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should list each condition given. Let me check again:\n\nOriginal question: \"Let k be a fixed positive number and n an integer increasing to infinity.\" So two assumptions here: k is fixed positive, n is integer increasing to infinity. Then the sum from ν=0 to n. The problem is to prove the asymptotic expression.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nk is a fixed positive number,\nn is an integer,\nn approaches infinity,\nthe summation index ν ranges from 0 to n.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumptions were split into separate lines. Each line addresses one property or condition applied to one object. So \"k is a fixed positive number\" is one line. \"n is an integer\" is another. \"n approaches infinity\" is a third. Then maybe the summation over ν from 0 to n is part of the problem statement rather than an assumption? Because in the original problem statement, the summation is part of the expression to be evaluated, not a condition. Hmm. Let me think.\n\nThe example given by the user had:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nSo they split into two assumptions even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". Wait, but in the example, the user added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps the example was modified? Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n)... is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems like the user made a mistake, but maybe the example is illustrative of how to structure, not necessarily correct. But regardless, following the user's instructions, we need to list each assumption line by line.\n\nIn the current problem, the original problem states: Let k be a fixed positive number and n an integer increasing to infinity. Then the sum from ν=0 to n... So the assumptions are:\n\n- k is a fixed positive number.\n- n is an integer.\n- n approaches infinity.\n\nThe summation from ν=0 to n is part of the problem's setup, but maybe it's considered a condition? Or is it part of the problem's statement? The problem is to prove the asymptotic expression for that sum. So the summation limits are part of the problem's definition. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\nk is a fixed positive number,\nn is an integer,\nn approaches infinity.\n\nThen the problem is to prove the given asymptotic expression for the sum from ν=0 to n of binomial(n,ν)^k.\n\nSo the formatted problem would have those three assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nk is a fixed positive number,\nn is an integer,\nn approaches infinity.\nProblem: \nProve that $$\\sum_{\\nu =0}^n \\binom{n}{\\nu}^k \\sim \\frac{2^{kn}}{\\sqrt{k}} \\left( \\frac{2}{\\pi n} \\right)^{\\frac{k-1}{2}}.$$\n###",
