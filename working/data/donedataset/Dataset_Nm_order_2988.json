    "Content": "We work over $\\mathbb C$. A general linear group ${\\rm GL}(V)$ acts diagonally on the tensor power $V^{\\otimes n}$ as $$(A^{\\otimes n})(v_1\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes v_n):=(Av_1)\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes (Av_n).$$ And the symmetric group $S_n$ acts on $V^{\\otimes n}$ from the right as $$(v_1\\otimes \\cdots \\otimes v_n)\\sigma=v_{\\sigma(1)}\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes v_{\\sigma(n)}.$$ The actions of ${\\rm GL}(V)$ and $S_n$ commute with each other. More strongly, Schur-Weyl duality states that the complex subalgebras of ${\\rm End}(V^{\\otimes n})$ generated by these two actions are each other's centralizers, in addition to providing the decomposition of $V^{\\otimes n}$ into irreducible representations of ${\\rm GL}(V)$, which are the Schur functors applied to $V$, given explicitly by ${\\Bbb S}_\\lambda(V)=V^{\\otimes n}\\otimes_{\\Bbb C[S_n]}M_\\lambda$ where $M_\\lambda$ are the irreducible reps of $S_n$ corresponding to integer partitions $\\lambda\\vdash n$. The assignment $V\\mapsto\\Bbb S_\\lambda(V)$ is indeed functorial, which mean ${\\rm GL}(V)$ also acts on $\\Bbb S_\\lambda(V)$. GroupProps provides the following trace formula, but does not provide any reference or discussion: $${\\rm tr}_{\\Bbb S_\\lambda(V)}A=\\frac{1}{n!}\\sum_{\\sigma\\in S_n} \\chi_\\lambda(\\sigma) \\prod_{i=1}^n {\\rm tr}_V(A^i)^{c_{\\large i}(\\sigma)}, \\tag{$\\circ$}$$ where $\\chi_\\lambda$ is the character of $M_\\lambda$ and $c_i(\\sigma)$ the number of length $i$ cycles in $\\sigma$. According to the relation to representation theory section on Wikipedia's article on schur polynomials , it follows from something called the Weyl character formula, but I have no idea how they're related and I'm not really familiar with Lie algebras anyway. I can prove the formula when $\\lambda=(1,\\cdots,1)$ and $M_\\lambda$ is the $1$-dimensional sign representation and $\\Bbb S_\\lambda(V)$ is the $n$th alternating/exterior power $\\Lambda^n(V)$. Here, the trace of $g\\in{\\rm GL}(V)$ acting on $\\Bbb S_\\lambda(V)$ is the $n$th elementary symmetric polynomial in the original eigenvalues of $g$. My argument uses generating functions and Vieta's formulas , the latter which is particular to the $e_n$s, so I doubt it generalizes to arbitrary $\\lambda$. I'd like to see a self-contained proof of $(\\circ)$, which doesn't assume anything about Schur polynomials, and ideally uses as little representation theory specific to $S_n$ as possible. (For instance, perhaps we could compute the trace of $g\\in{\\rm GL}(V)$ on $V^{\\otimes n}\\otimes_{\\Bbb C[S_n]}(\\Bbb C[S_n]\\sum_{\\sigma\\in S_n}\\chi_\\lambda(\\sigma)\\sigma)$ and then divide by $\\chi_\\lambda(1)$, without ever having to actually know the values $\\chi_\\lambda(\\sigma)$, but that might be optimistic). Your thoughts?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Put $m = \\dim V$, and let $\\{e_1,\\ldots,e_m\\}$ be a basis of $V$ over $\\mathbb{C}$. Let $\\pi : \\operatorname{GL}(V) \\to \\operatorname{GL}(V^{\\otimes n})$ and $\\rho : S_n \\to \\operatorname{GL}(V^{\\otimes n})$ denote the commuting representations of $\\operatorname{GL}(V)$ and $S_n$ on $V^{\\otimes n}$, respectively. In particular, for $\\sigma \\in S_n$ and $1 \\leq i_1,\\ldots,i_n \\leq m$ we have\n$$ \\rho(\\sigma)(e_{i_1} \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes e_{i_n}) = e_{i_{\\sigma^{-1}(1)}} \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes e_{i_{\\sigma^{-1}(n)}}.$$\nFix a partition $\\lambda \\vdash n$. The operator $P_\\lambda \\in \\operatorname{End}(V^{\\otimes n})$, given by \n$$ P_\\lambda = \\frac{\\dim M_\\lambda}{n!}\\sum_{\\sigma\\, \\in\\, S_n}\\overline{\\chi_\\lambda(\\sigma)}\\;\\rho(\\sigma), \\tag{1}$$\nis the projection onto the $\\lambda$-isotypic component of $V^{\\otimes n}$ as a module over $S_n$ (cf. e.g. Cor. 4.3.11 on pp. 213-214  in Symmetry, representations, and invariants (2009) by Goodman and Wallach). By Schur-Weyl duality, the $\\lambda$-isotypic component of $V^{\\otimes n}$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{S}_\\lambda(V)\\otimes_{\\mathbb{C}} M_\\lambda$, as a module over $\\operatorname{GL}(V)\\times S_n$. Therefore, one can relate the character of $\\mathbb{S}_\\lambda(V)$ to the character of $V^{\\otimes n}$ as follows:\n$$ \\operatorname{tr}_{\\mathbb{S}_\\lambda(V)}\\pi(A) = \\frac{1}{\\dim M_\\lambda}\\operatorname{tr}_{V^{\\otimes n}}\\big(\\pi(A)\\,P_\\lambda\\big). \\tag{2}$$\nFor our purposes, it will be more convenient to rewrite $(1)$ with $\\sigma$ replaced by $\\sigma^{-1}$. Thus,\n$$P_\\lambda = \\frac{\\dim M_\\lambda}{n!}\\sum_{\\sigma\\, \\in\\, S_n}\\chi_\\lambda(\\sigma)\\;\\rho(\\sigma^{-1}). \\tag{3}$$\nIn view of $(2)$ and $(3)$, in order to prove formula $(\\circ)$ in the question above, we have to show that \n$$\\operatorname{tr}_{V^{\\otimes n}}\\big(\\pi(A)\\,\\rho(\\sigma^{-1})\\big) = \\prod_{k=1}^n \\operatorname{tr}_V\\big(A^k\\big)^{c_k(\\sigma)} \\tag{4}$$\nfor $A \\in \\operatorname{GL}(V)$ and $\\sigma \\in S_n$. Since the semi-simple elements are everywhere dense in $\\operatorname{GL}(V)$ and the characters are polynomial class functions, it suffices to consider only the case when $A$ is diagonal with respect to the chosen basis $\\{e_1,\\ldots,e_m\\}$ of $V$. Thus, let $A(e_i) = x_ie_i$ with $x_i \\in \\mathbb{C}^\\times$. If $\\{e_1^*,\\ldots,e_m^*\\}$ is the dual basis of $V^*$, then we have\n$$ \\begin{multline}\\operatorname{tr}_{V^{\\otimes n}}\\big(\\pi(A)\\,\\rho(\\sigma^{-1})\\big) = \\sum_{1\\leq i_1,\\ldots,i_n \\leq m} \\langle e_{i_1}^*\\otimes \\cdots \\otimes e_{i_n}^*,\\, A(e_{i_{\\sigma(1)}})\\otimes \\cdots \\otimes A(e_{i_{\\sigma(n)}})\\rangle =\\\\ \\sum_{1\\leq i_1,\\ldots,i_n\\leq m} \\delta_{i_1,i_{\\sigma(1)}}\\cdots \\delta_{i_n,i_{\\sigma(n)}}\\cdot x_{i_1}\\cdots x_{i_n},\\end{multline} \\tag{5}$$\nwhere $\\delta_{ij}$ denotes Kronecker's symbol. Fix $\\sigma \\in S_n$, and let $\\sigma = \\zeta_1 \\cdots \\zeta_s$ be its decomposition into a product of disjoint cycles (including those of length $1$). For $1\\leq j\\leq n$, let $\\ell_j$ denote the length of the cycle $\\zeta_j$, and fix $p_j \\in \\{1,\\ldots,n\\}$ so that $\\zeta_j = \\left(p_j,\\sigma(p_j),\\ldots,\\sigma^{\\ell_j-1}(p_j)\\right)$. The coefficient in front of $x_{i_1}\\cdots x_{i_n}$ in $(5)$ is non-zero if and only if $i_q = i_{\\sigma(q)}$ for all $1 \\leq q \\leq n$, i.e. if and only if $i_{\\sigma^k(p_j)} = i_{p_j}$ for all $1\\leq j\\leq s$, $0< k <\\ell_j$. Thus, the non-zero terms of $(5)$ are of the form \n$$ x_{i_1} \\cdots x_{i_n} = \\prod_{j=1}^s \\left(\\prod_{k=0}^{\\ell_j-1}x_{i_{\\sigma^k(p_j)}}\\right) = x_{i_{p_1}}^{\\ell_1}\\cdots x_{i_{p_s}}^{\\ell_s}.$$\nThis means that in $(5)$, the values of the indices $i_{p_1},\\ldots,i_{p_s}$ can be chosen arbitrarily and independently of each other in $\\{1,\\ldots,m\\}$, while the values of the remaining indices are determined by those of the former ones, according to the cycle structure of $\\sigma$. Hence, putting $r_j = i_{p_j}$ for $1\\leq j \\leq s$, we obtain\n$$ \\operatorname{tr}_{V^{\\otimes n}}\\big(\\pi(A)\\,\\rho(\\sigma^{-1})\\big) = \\sum_{1\\leq r_1,\\ldots,r_s\\leq m} x_{r_1}^{\\ell_1} \\cdots x_{r_s}^{\\ell_s}.$$\nThe right hand side of the above formula is nothing but\n$$  \\prod_{j=1}^s\\left(\\sum_{r=1}^m x_r^{\\ell_j}\\right) = \\prod_{j=1}^s \\operatorname{tr}_V\\left(A^{\\ell_j}\\right).$$\nGrouping together the contributions from cycles of the same length in this product, we obtain the right hand side of $(4)$.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let's tackle this problem. The user wants a formatted version of the Math Stack Exchange question according to the specified format. First, I need to parse the original question and identify the key assumptions and the main problem.\n\nThe original question is about proving a trace formula for Schur functors using Schur-Weyl duality. The user mentions several mathematical objects and their properties: GL(V) acting on tensor power, symmetric group S_n commuting with GL(V), Schur-Weyl duality, Schur functors defined via tensor products over C[S_n], and the trace formula involving characters of S_n and traces of powers of A. The user also states they can prove the formula for the exterior power case but want a general proof without relying on Schur polynomials or advanced representation theory.\n\nSo, I need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let's go through the problem step by step.\n\n1. The base field is the complex numbers (C).\n2. GL(V) acts diagonally on V^{\\otimes n} as described.\n3. S_n acts on V^{\\otimes n} by permuting factors.\n4. The actions of GL(V) and S_n commute.\n5. Schur-Weyl duality states that their generated subalgebras are each other's centralizers.\n6. Schur functors S_λ(V) are defined as V^{\\otimes n} ⊗_{C[S_n]} M_λ, where M_λ is an irreducible S_n-module for partition λ ⊢ n.\n7. The trace formula given involves characters χ_λ of S_n and cycle counts c_i(σ) in permutations σ.\n\nThe problem is to prove this trace formula in a self-contained way without assuming knowledge of Schur polynomials or heavy S_n representation theory.\n\nNow, structuring this into the Assumption and Problem sections. Each assumption should be a single line, one condition per line, applied to one object. Let's list them:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The base field is $\\mathbb C$.\n- ${\\rm GL}(V)$ acts diagonally on $V^{\\otimes n}$ via $(A^{\\otimes n})(v_1\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes v_n)=(Av_1)\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes (Av_n)$.\n- The symmetric group $S_n$ acts on $V^{\\otimes n}$ by permuting tensor factors as $(v_1\\otimes \\cdots \\otimes v_n)\\sigma=v_{\\sigma(1)}\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes v_{\\sigma(n)}$.\n- The actions of ${\\rm GL}(V)$ and $S_n$ on $V^{\\otimes n}$ commute.\n- Schur-Weyl duality holds: the subalgebras generated by ${\\rm GL}(V)$ and $S_n$ actions are each other's centralizers in ${\\rm End}(V^{\\otimes n})$.\n- The Schur functor ${\\Bbb S}_\\lambda(V)$ is defined as $V^{\\otimes n}\\otimes_{\\Bbb C[S_n]}M_\\lambda$ where $M_\\lambda$ is the irreducible $S_n$-module corresponding to partition $\\lambda \\vdash n$.\n- The trace formula to prove is ${\\rm tr}_{\\Bbb S_\\lambda(V)}A=\\frac{1}{n!}\\sum_{\\sigma\\in S_n} \\chi_\\lambda(\\sigma) \\prod_{i=1}^n {\\rm tr}_V(A^i)^{c_{i}(\\sigma)}$ where $\\chi_\\lambda$ is the character of $M_\\lambda$ and $c_i(\\sigma)$ is the number of $i$-cycles in $\\sigma$.\n\nProblem:\nProve the trace formula for ${\\rm tr}_{\\Bbb S_\\lambda(V)}A$ without assuming prior knowledge of Schur polynomials and using minimal representation theory specific to $S_n$.\n\nWait, but in the example provided, assumptions are more about the problem's conditions, not the background theory. The user might want only the essential conditions of the problem, not the setup. Let me check the example again. The example includes \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. So perhaps the assumptions here are the given conditions needed to state the problem, not the background definitions.\n\nBut in this case, the problem is to prove a formula under the context of Schur-Weyl duality. The assumptions would be the setup required for the formula. So perhaps:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The base field is $\\mathbb C$.\n- ${\\rm GL}(V)$ acts on $V^{\\otimes n}$ via the diagonal action.\n- $S_n$ acts on $V^{\\otimes n}$ by permuting tensor factors.\n- The actions of ${\\rm GL}(V)$ and $S_n$ on $V^{\\otimes n}$ commute.\n- Schur-Weyl duality holds for these actions.\n- ${\\Bbb S}_\\lambda(V) = V^{\\otimes n} \\otimes_{\\mathbb C[S_n]} M_\\lambda$ where $M_\\lambda$ is an irreducible $S_n$-module for partition $\\lambda \\vdash n$.\n- $\\chi_\\lambda$ is the character of $M_\\lambda$.\n- For a permutation $\\sigma \\in S_n$, $c_i(\\sigma)$ denotes the number of cycles of length $i$ in $\\sigma$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $${\\rm tr}_{\\Bbb S_\\lambda(V)}A=\\frac{1}{n!}\\sum_{\\sigma\\in S_n} \\chi_\\lambda(\\sigma) \\prod_{i=1}^n {\\rm tr}_V(A^i)^{c_{i}(\\sigma)}$$ holds, using a self-contained approach that does not assume knowledge of Schur polynomials and minimizes the use of $S_n$-specific representation theory.\n\nBut perhaps some of these are part of the problem statement rather than assumptions. The key is to filter out unrelated information. The original question mentions they can prove it for the exterior power case, but that's not part of the problem's assumptions. Also, references to Wikipedia or other sections are not needed.\n\nSo, in the formatted problem, the assumptions should include the setup necessary to state the trace formula: the actions of GL(V) and S_n, Schur-Weyl duality, the definition of Schur functors, and the definitions of χ_λ and c_i(σ).\n\nYes, each of these is a separate assumption. Now, making sure each line is a single condition applied to one object. For example:\n\nAssumption:\n- The base field is $\\mathbb C$.\n- The group ${\\rm GL}(V)$ acts diagonally on $V^{\\otimes n}$.\n- The symmetric group $S_n$ acts on $V^{\\otimes n}$ by permuting tensor factors.\n- The actions of ${\\rm GL}(V)$ and $S_n$ on $V^{\\otimes n}$ commute.\n- Schur-Weyl duality holds for the commuting actions of ${\\rm GL}(V)$ and $S_n$ on $V^{\\otimes n}$.\n- The Schur functor $\\Bbb S_\\lambda(V)$ is defined as $V^{\\otimes n} \\otimes_{\\mathbb C[S_n]} M_\\lambda$ for an irreducible $S_n$-module $M_\\lambda$ corresponding to partition $\\lambda \\vdash n$.\n- The character $\\chi_\\lambda$ is the character of the $S_n$-module $M_\\lambda$.\n- For a permutation $\\sigma \\in S_n$, $c_i(\\sigma)$ denotes the number of cycles of length $i$ in $\\sigma$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the trace of $A \\in {\\rm GL}(V)$ acting on $\\Bbb S_\\lambda(V)$ is given by\n$${\\rm tr}_{\\Bbb S_\\lambda(V)}A=\\frac{1}{n!}\\sum_{\\sigma\\in S_n} \\chi_\\lambda(\\sigma) \\prod_{i=1}^n {\\rm tr}_V(A^i)^{c_{i}(\\sigma)},$$\nusing a self-contained approach without assuming prior knowledge of Schur polynomials and minimizing the use of $S_n$-specific representation theory.\n\nYes, this seems to capture the necessary assumptions and the problem statement. Each assumption is a single line, each applying to one object or condition. The problem is to prove the trace formula under these conditions with the specified constraints on the proof method.",
