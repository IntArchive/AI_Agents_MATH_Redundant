    "Content": "Let $A$ be a non-empty set and $n$ be the number of elements in $A$, i.e. $n:=|A|$. I know that the number of elements of the power set of $A$ is $2^n$, i.e.  $|\\mathcal{P}(A)|=2^n$. I came across the fact that exactly half of the elements of $\\mathcal{P}(A)$ contain an odd number of elements, and half of them an even number of elements. Can someone prove this? Or hint at a proof?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Fix an element $a\\in A$ (this is the point where $A\\ne\\emptyset$ is needed).\nThen $$S\\mapsto S\\operatorname{\\Delta}\\{a\\}$$ ( symmetric difference ) is a bijection from the set of odd subsets to the set of even subsets.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me start by reading the original question carefully. The user is asking about proving that exactly half of the elements of the power set of A are odd-sized and the other half are even-sized. The original problem mentions that A is a non-empty set with n elements, and the power set has 2^n elements. The key fact to prove is that half of these subsets have an odd number of elements and half have an even number.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The example given in the problem shows that each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. Let's see:\n\n1. The set A is non-empty. That's one assumption.\n2. The number of elements in A is n, so |A| = n. That's another assumption.\n3. The power set of A, denoted as P(A), has 2^n elements. But wait, is that an assumption or a known fact? The problem states this as a fact, so maybe it's part of the problem statement rather than an assumption. However, the user might be assuming that the reader knows the power set's size is 2^n. But according to the example provided earlier, the original problem mentioned the power set's size, and in the formatted example, they included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, maybe the key assumptions are that A is non-empty and n = |A|. The size of the power set is a known result, so perhaps it's not listed as an assumption but part of the problem context.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which was listed as an assumption. Then they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as another assumption. But in the problem here, the user states \"Let A be a non-empty set and n be the number of elements in A\". So those are the given conditions. The power set's size being 2^n is a standard result, so maybe the user isn't assuming it but stating it as context. However, to structure it properly, maybe the assumptions should include:\n\n- A is a non-empty set.\n- The number of elements in A is n (i.e., |A| = n).\n\nThe problem statement then includes the fact that the power set has 2^n elements, but that's more of a given fact rather than an assumption. But according to the example, the assumptions included that n is an integer. Wait, in the example, the problem was about A(n) being divisible by 91 for every integer n, and the assumption was \"n is an integer\". Here, the problem states that A is a non-empty set, so n must be at least 1, but n is just the cardinality of A, which is a positive integer. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- A is a non-empty set.\n- The number of elements in A is n, where n is a positive integer (since A is non-empty).\n\nBut the original problem didn't explicitly state that n is a positive integer; it's implied by A being non-empty. However, to make it clear, maybe the assumptions should include that n is a positive integer. But the original question starts by saying \"Let A be a non-empty set and n be the number of elements in A\", which implies that n is a positive integer (since the set is non-empty). So translating that into assumptions:\n\nAssumptions:\n- A is a non-empty set.\n- The number of elements in A is n (i.e., |A| = n).\n\nBut wait, the example had \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. Here, n is the cardinality of a non-empty set, so n is a positive integer. However, the problem as stated doesn't restrict n to any specific type beyond being the size of A. So perhaps:\n\nAssumptions:\n- A is a non-empty set.\n- The number of elements in A is n.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that exactly half of the elements of P(A) are odd-sized and half are even-sized. But the original problem mentions that the user knows |P(A)|=2^n, which is a standard result. However, in the example, the problem included \"the number of elements of the power set of A is 2^n\" as part of the original problem's given information. But in the formatted example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. So in this case, maybe the fact that |P(A)|=2^n is part of the problem's given information, but not an assumption. However, in the example, the problem statement included \"the number of elements of the power set of A is 2^n\" as part of the original problem, but in the formatted problem, it wasn't listed as an assumption. Instead, the assumptions were about n. So here, perhaps the assumptions are just the existence of A and its cardinality. The size of the power set is part of the problem context. Therefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n- A is a non-empty set.\n- The number of elements in A is n.\n\nThen the problem is: Prove that exactly half of the elements of P(A) are odd-sized, and half are even-sized.\n\nWait, but in the example, the problem had \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" with the assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So in that case, the problem statement included the formula for A(n), and the assumptions were about n. Here, the problem is to prove that exactly half are odd-sized. The key assumptions are that A is non-empty and has n elements. The power set's size being 2^n is part of the known facts, so perhaps it's not listed as an assumption. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a non-empty set,\nThe number of elements in A is n.\n\nProblem:\nProve that exactly half of the elements of P(A) are odd-sized and half are even-sized.\n\nBut wait, the original problem mentions that |P(A)|=2^n, so maybe that's an assumption? Wait, in the example, the original problem stated that the number of elements of the power set is 2^n, but in the formatted problem, it wasn't listed as an assumption. Instead, the assumption was about n being an integer. Here, since the problem is about the parity of subset sizes, the key assumptions are that A is non-empty and has n elements. The size of the power set being 2^n is a fact that follows from the definition of power sets, so maybe it's not an assumption but part of the problem's given information. Therefore, the correct formatting would be as above.\n\nAnother point: the original problem says \"exactly half of the elements of P(A) are odd-sized\". Since the total number is 2^n, which is even if n ≥ 1, this split into two equal parts makes sense. But the problem is to prove that split. So the assumptions are A non-empty (so n ≥ 1) and |A|=n. Therefore, the formatted problem should have those two assumptions.",
