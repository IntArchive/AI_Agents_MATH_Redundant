    "Content": "This is an exercise from Problems from the Book by Andreescu and Dospinescu.  When it was posted on AoPS a year ago I spent several hours trying to solve it, but to no avail, so I am hoping someone here can enlighten me. Problem: Prove that the function $f : [0, 1) \\to \\mathbb{R}$ defined by $\\displaystyle f(x) = \\log_2 (1 - x) + x + x^2 + x^4 + x^8 + ...$ is bounded. A preliminary observation is that $f$ satisfies $f(x^2) = f(x) + \\log_2 (1 + x) - x$.  I played around with using this functional equation for awhile, but couldn't quite make it work.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "OK, a second trick is needed (but it actually finishes the problem).  It is nice and simple enough that it's probably what the authors intended by a \"Book\" solution. Let $f(x) = x \\log(2) - \\log(1+x)$.  We want to show that $S(x) = f(x) + f(x^2) + f(x^4) + \\dots$ is bounded.  Because $f(0)=f(1)=0$ and $f$ is differentiable, we can find a constant $A$ such that $|f(x)| \\leq Ax(1-x) = Ax - Ax^2$.  The sum of this bound over the powers $x^{2^k}$ is telescopic. Notice that the role of $\\log(2)$ was to ensure that $f(1)=0$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The goal is to prove that the function f(x) defined as log base 2 of (1 - x) plus the sum x + x² + x⁴ + x⁸ + ... is bounded on the interval [0, 1). \n\nFirst, I need to understand each component of the function. The log part, log₂(1 - x), as x approaches 1 from the left, 1 - x approaches 0, so the logarithm tends to negative infinity. But there's this infinite series: x + x² + x⁴ + x⁸ + ... The exponents here are powers of 2, right? Like 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. So it's x^{2⁰} + x^{2¹} + x^{2²} + x^{2³} + ... \n\nWait, that series is interesting. Let me denote S(x) = sum_{n=0}^∞ x^{2ⁿ}. Does this series converge for x in [0, 1)? Since each term is positive and less than 1, and the exponents grow exponentially, the terms go to zero very fast, but the number of terms is infinite. However, for x in [0,1), x^{2ⁿ} decreases rapidly as n increases. For example, if x is 1/2, then x² = 1/4, x⁴ = 1/16, x⁸ = 1/256, etc. The sum would be 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/16 + 1/256 + ... which is a converging geometric series? Wait, no, because each term is x^{2ⁿ}, so the ratio between terms isn't constant. Let me check the convergence. \n\nThe root test: lim sup |x^{2ⁿ}|^{1/n} = lim x^{2ⁿ/n} = lim x^{2ⁿ/n}. As n approaches infinity, 2ⁿ/n approaches infinity, so x^{2ⁿ/n} approaches 0 if x is in [0,1). Therefore, the root test gives a limit of 0, which is less than 1, so the series converges absolutely. So S(x) is convergent for x in [0,1). That's good, so the function f(x) is well-defined.\n\nNow, the problem is to show that f(x) is bounded on [0,1). That is, there exists some constant M such that |f(x)| ≤ M for all x in [0,1). \n\nGiven that the logarithm term tends to -∞ as x approaches 1, but the series S(x) might tend to +∞. So maybe their combination cancels each other's divergence? The challenge is to show that even though both terms might individually blow up (but in opposite directions), their sum remains bounded.\n\nThe user mentioned a functional equation: f(x²) = f(x) + log₂(1 + x) - x. Maybe we can use this to express f(x) in terms of f(x²), and iterate this process. Let me try that.\n\nGiven f(x²) = f(x) + log₂(1 + x) - x, then rearranging gives f(x) = f(x²) - log₂(1 + x) + x. If we iterate this equation, substituting x² into itself, we get f(x²) = f(x⁴) - log₂(1 + x²) + x². Substituting back into the original equation: f(x) = [f(x⁴) - log₂(1 + x²) + x²] - log₂(1 + x) + x. Continuing this, each time replacing f(x^{2ⁿ}) with f(x^{2^{n+1}}) - log₂(1 + x^{2ⁿ}) + x^{2ⁿ}, we might get a telescoping series. \n\nIf we iterate this infinitely, assuming that as n approaches infinity, x^{2ⁿ} approaches 0 (since |x| < 1), then f(x^{2ⁿ}) might approach f(0). Let's check f(0): log₂(1 - 0) + 0 + 0 + ... = log₂(1) + 0 = 0. So f(0) = 0. Then, perhaps f(x) can be expressed as the sum from n=0 to ∞ of [log₂(1 + x^{2ⁿ}) - x^{2ⁿ}]. Wait, but let's see.\n\nStarting with f(x) = f(x²) - log₂(1 + x) + x.\n\nThen f(x) = f(x⁴) - log₂(1 + x²) + x² - log₂(1 + x) + x.\n\nContinuing, f(x) = f(x⁸) - log₂(1 + x⁴) + x⁴ - log₂(1 + x²) + x² - log₂(1 + x) + x.\n\nAfter k iterations, f(x) = f(x^{2^{k+1}}) + sum_{n=0}^k [x^{2ⁿ} - log₂(1 + x^{2ⁿ})].\n\nAssuming that as k approaches infinity, x^{2^{k}} approaches 0, so f(x^{2^{k+1}}) approaches f(0) = 0. Therefore, f(x) = sum_{n=0}^∞ [x^{2ⁿ} - log₂(1 + x^{2ⁿ})].\n\nBut wait, the original f(x) is log₂(1 - x) + sum_{n=0}^∞ x^{2ⁿ}. So according to the functional equation, f(x) equals the infinite sum of [x^{2ⁿ} - log₂(1 + x^{2ⁿ})]. Hmm, but how does that relate to the original expression?\n\nWait, let's check this. The original f(x) is log₂(1 - x) + S(x), where S(x) = sum_{n=0}^∞ x^{2ⁿ}.\n\nFrom the functional equation, we derived f(x) = sum_{n=0}^∞ [x^{2ⁿ} - log₂(1 + x^{2ⁿ})]. But the original f(x) is log₂(1 - x) + sum x^{2ⁿ}. So equating these two expressions:\n\nlog₂(1 - x) + S(x) = sum_{n=0}^∞ [x^{2ⁿ} - log₂(1 + x^{2ⁿ})]\n\nTherefore, S(x) cancels out on both sides? Wait, no, because the sum on the right is sum [x^{2ⁿ} - log(...)], so sum x^{2ⁿ} is S(x), so we have:\n\nlog₂(1 - x) + S(x) = S(x) - sum_{n=0}^∞ log₂(1 + x^{2ⁿ})\n\nTherefore, log₂(1 - x) = - sum_{n=0}^∞ log₂(1 + x^{2ⁿ})\n\nExponentiating both sides (base 2), we get:\n\n1 - x = product_{n=0}^∞ 1/(1 + x^{2ⁿ})\n\nBut wait, 1 - x = product_{n=0}^∞ 1/(1 + x^{2ⁿ})?\n\nHmm, let's check for x=0: left side is 1, right side is product 1/(1+0) = 1, so that works. For x approaching 1, product_{n=0}^∞ 1/(1 + x^{2ⁿ}) = product_{n=0}^∞ 1/(1 + x^{2ⁿ}). Hmm, but I recall that there's an infinite product identity related to 1 - x. Let me recall: 1 - x = product_{k=0}^∞ (1 - x^{2^{k}}). But that's different. Wait, maybe there's a similar identity here. Wait, perhaps not. Let me compute the product of 1/(1 + x^{2ⁿ}) for n from 0 to infinity.\n\nWait, consider product_{n=0}^N (1 + x^{2ⁿ}) = 1 + x + x² + x³ + ... + x^{2^{N+1} - 1}. Because each multiplication by (1 + x^{2ⁿ}) doubles the number of terms. This is a geometric series. Indeed, product_{n=0}^N (1 + x^{2ⁿ}) = (1 - x^{2^{N+1}}}) / (1 - x). So taking the reciprocal, product_{n=0}^N 1/(1 + x^{2ⁿ}) = (1 - x)/(1 - x^{2^{N+1}}}).\n\nTherefore, as N approaches infinity, x^{2^{N+1}}} approaches 0 for x in [0,1), so product_{n=0}^∞ 1/(1 + x^{2ⁿ}) = (1 - x)/1 = 1 - x. Therefore, the identity holds: 1 - x = product_{n=0}^∞ 1/(1 + x^{2ⁿ}}). Taking log base 2 of both sides, we get log₂(1 - x) = - sum_{n=0}^∞ log₂(1 + x^{2ⁿ}}). So that checks out. Therefore, the functional equation approach leads us to that identity, which is valid.\n\nBut how does this help in showing that f(x) is bounded? Wait, from the functional equation iteration, we have:\n\nf(x) = sum_{n=0}^∞ [x^{2ⁿ} - log₂(1 + x^{2ⁿ})].\n\nTherefore, f(x) is equal to the sum from n=0 to infinity of [x^{2ⁿ} - log₂(1 + x^{2ⁿ})]. If we can show that this sum converges and is bounded on [0,1), then we're done.\n\nSo, let's analyze each term of the sum: a_n(x) = x^{2ⁿ} - log₂(1 + x^{2ⁿ}}).\n\nWe need to estimate the sum of a_n(x) over n ≥ 0 for x in [0,1).\n\nFirst, let's consider the behavior of each term a_n(x). For each fixed n, as x approaches 1 from below, x^{2ⁿ} approaches 1, so 1 + x^{2ⁿ} approaches 2, so log₂(2) = 1. Therefore, a_n(x) approaches 1 - 1 = 0. For x near 0, x^{2ⁿ} is very small, so we can approximate log₂(1 + x^{2ⁿ}) ≈ x^{2ⁿ} / ln 2 - (x^{2ⁿ})² / (2 (ln 2)) + ... using the Taylor series expansion of log₂(1 + t) where t is small. Since log₂(1 + t) = t / ln 2 - t² / (2 (ln 2)) + t³ / (3 (ln 2)) - ... So, a_n(x) = t - [t / ln 2 - t² / (2 ln 2) + ...] where t = x^{2ⁿ}. Therefore, a_n(x) ≈ t - t / ln 2 + t² / (2 ln 2) - ... = t(1 - 1/ln 2) + t²/(2 ln 2) - ... Since ln 2 is approximately 0.693, so 1/ln 2 ≈ 1.4427, so 1 - 1/ln 2 ≈ -0.4427. Therefore, for small t, a_n(x) is approximately negative. \n\nBut wait, if x^{2ⁿ} is small, then log₂(1 + x^{2ⁿ}) ≈ x^{2ⁿ}/ln 2 - (x^{2ⁿ})²/(2 ln 2). Therefore, x^{2ⁿ} - log₂(1 + x^{2ⁿ}) ≈ x^{2ⁿ} - [x^{2ⁿ}/ln 2 - (x^{4ⁿ})/(2 ln 2)] = x^{2ⁿ}(1 - 1/ln 2) + x^{4ⁿ}/(2 ln 2). Since 1 - 1/ln 2 is negative (≈ -0.4427), the leading term is negative, but the next term is positive. However, for very small x^{2ⁿ}, the x^{4ⁿ} term is negligible. Therefore, each term a_n(x) is negative when x^{2ⁿ} is small. But as x increases towards 1, a_n(x) approaches 0 from below? Wait, no. When x^{2ⁿ} approaches 1, then a_n(x) = x^{2ⁿ} - log₂(1 + x^{2ⁿ}}). Let t = x^{2ⁿ}, t approaches 1 from below. So t - log₂(1 + t). Let's compute this at t=1: 1 - log₂(2) = 1 - 1 = 0. The derivative of t - log₂(1 + t) is 1 - [1/( (1 + t) ln 2 )]. At t=1, derivative is 1 - [1/(2 ln 2)] ≈ 1 - 0.721 ≈ 0.279, which is positive. So near t=1, the function t - log₂(1 + t) is increasing. At t=0, the function is 0 - 0 = 0. Wait, but earlier approximation suggested for small t, the term is negative. Let me check: for t near 0, t - log₂(1 + t) ≈ t - [t/ln 2 - t²/(2 ln 2)] = t(1 - 1/ln 2) + t²/(2 ln 2). Since 1 - 1/ln 2 ≈ -0.4427, so yes, it's negative for small t. Then, at t=1, it's 0. So the function goes from negative at t=0 to 0 at t=1, and since the derivative at t=1 is positive, the function is increasing at t=1, but overall, between t=0 and t=1, the function t - log₂(1 + t) starts negative, increases, and reaches 0 at t=1. So there must be a point where it crosses from negative to positive. Wait, let's check the derivative. The derivative is 1 - [1 / ((1 + t) ln 2)]. Setting derivative to zero: 1 = 1 / ((1 + t) ln 2) => (1 + t) ln 2 = 1 => 1 + t = 1/ln2 ≈ 1.4427 => t ≈ 0.4427. So the function t - log₂(1 + t) has a critical point at t ≈ 0.4427. Let's check the value there. Let t ≈ 0.4427. Then log₂(1 + t) ≈ log₂(1.4427) ≈ log2(e^{0.47}) ≈ 0.47 / ln2 ≈ 0.47 / 0.693 ≈ 0.678. So t - log₂(1 + t) ≈ 0.4427 - 0.678 ≈ -0.235. So the function has a minimum at t ≈ 0.4427 with value ≈ -0.235, then increases towards 0 at t=1. Therefore, the maximum value of t - log₂(1 + t) on [0,1) is 0 (achieved at t=1), and the minimum is approximately -0.235. Therefore, each term a_n(x) = x^{2ⁿ} - log₂(1 + x^{2ⁿ}) is bounded between -0.235 and 0. \n\nTherefore, the sum over n of a_n(x) is a sum of negative terms (since each a_n(x) ≤ 0) but how negative? If each term is bounded below by -0.235, then the total sum would be bounded below by -0.235 * ∞, which is -∞. But that can't be, since we are supposed to show f(x) is bounded. Wait, this suggests a contradiction. Therefore, my analysis must be incorrect. \n\nWait, but earlier, we have f(x) = sum_{n=0}^∞ [x^{2ⁿ} - log₂(1 + x^{2ⁿ})]. If each term is negative, then the sum would be negative infinity unless the terms decay sufficiently fast. But earlier, I thought the series converges. Wait, but in reality, the convergence of the series S(x) is absolute, so when we subtracted log₂(1 - x), which is equivalent to the sum of log₂(1 + x^{2ⁿ}), then the difference f(x) = log₂(1 - x) + S(x) must be finite. But according to the functional equation iteration, f(x) is expressed as the infinite sum of [x^{2ⁿ} - log₂(1 + x^{2ⁿ}}). So if each term is negative, but the sum converges, then f(x) would be negative and finite. But how can we show that the sum is bounded below and above?\n\nWait, but maybe the terms a_n(x) = x^{2ⁿ} - log₂(1 + x^{2ⁿ}}) are not all negative. Earlier analysis showed that for small t (x^{2ⁿ}), a_n(x) is negative, but as t approaches 1, a_n(x) approaches 0. But wait, when t is very close to 1, say t = 1 - ε, then log₂(1 + t) = log₂(2 - ε) ≈ 1 - ε/(2 ln 2). Then, t - log₂(1 + t) ≈ (1 - ε) - [1 - ε/(2 ln 2)] = -ε + ε/(2 ln 2) = -ε (1 - 1/(2 ln 2)). Since 1/(2 ln 2) ≈ 0.721, so 1 - 0.721 ≈ 0.279, so this is approximately -0.279 ε. Therefore, even as t approaches 1, the term a_n(x) approaches 0 from below. Therefore, all terms a_n(x) are negative or zero. Therefore, the sum is a sum of non-positive terms. But how can this sum converge to a finite value? Because each term is negative, but the partial sums are decreasing, so for convergence, the terms must approach zero sufficiently fast.\n\nIndeed, for each fixed x in [0,1), x^{2ⁿ} decreases exponentially as n increases. Therefore, the terms a_n(x) = x^{2ⁿ} - log₂(1 + x^{2ⁿ}}) decay rapidly. For example, take x=0.5. Then x^{2ⁿ} = (0.5)^{2ⁿ}. So for n=0: 0.5, n=1: 0.25, n=2: 0.0625, n=3: 0.00390625, etc. So the terms a_n(x) become very small very quickly. Similarly, for x close to 1, say x=0.99. Then x^{2ⁿ} decreases rapidly: x^{2^0}=0.99, x^{2^1}=0.9801, x^{2^2}=0.96059601, x^{2^3}≈0.923..., x^{2^4}≈0.852..., x^{2^5}≈0.726..., x^{2^6}≈0.527..., x^{2^7}≈0.278..., x^{2^8}≈0.077..., etc. So even for x close to 1, after several terms, x^{2ⁿ} becomes small, and the corresponding a_n(x) becomes close to -0.235, but then continues to decrease in n. Wait, but as n increases, x^{2ⁿ} decreases, so each subsequent term is a_n(x) with smaller t, which we approximated as approximately -0.4427 t. So the terms decay roughly like x^{2ⁿ}.\n\nTherefore, the sum over n of a_n(x) is sum_{n=0}^∞ [x^{2ⁿ} - log₂(1 + x^{2ⁿ})] ≈ sum_{n=0}^\\infty [ -0.4427 x^{2ⁿ} + higher order terms]. Since the higher order terms are much smaller, the dominant term is a constant multiple of sum x^{2ⁿ}, which is S(x). But wait, S(x) is part of the original function f(x). However, since we already expressed f(x) as this sum, which is supposed to be bounded.\n\nBut maybe we can bound each term a_n(x). Since for each t in [0,1), we have t - log₂(1 + t) ≤ 0. Also, earlier we found that the minimum of t - log₂(1 + t) is approximately -0.235. But actually, let's compute the exact minimum. Let’s set the derivative of g(t) = t - log₂(1 + t) to zero. The derivative is g’(t) = 1 - 1/( (1 + t) ln 2 ). Setting to zero: 1 = 1/( (1 + t) ln 2 ) => (1 + t) ln 2 = 1 => t = (1 / ln 2 ) - 1 ≈ 1.4427 - 1 = 0.4427. Then, g(t) at this point is 0.4427 - log₂(1 + 0.4427) = 0.4427 - log₂(1.4427). Let's compute log₂(1.4427). Since 2^0.5 ≈ 1.4142, and 2^0.55 ≈ e^{0.55 ln 2} ≈ e^{0.381} ≈ 1.463. So 1.4427 is between 2^0.5 and 2^0.55. Let's compute log₂(1.4427) ≈ 0.535. Therefore, g(t) ≈ 0.4427 - 0.535 ≈ -0.0923. Wait, that's different from my previous estimate. Maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let's compute it accurately.\n\nCompute t = 1/ln2 -1 ≈ 1.4427 -1 = 0.4427.\n\nlog₂(1 + t) = log₂(1.4427).\n\nWe know that 2^{0.5} = sqrt(2) ≈ 1.4142\n\n2^{0.535} ≈ 2^{0.5 + 0.035} ≈ 1.4142 * 2^{0.035} ≈ 1.4142 * 1.025 ≈ 1.449. Close to 1.4427. So 2^{0.53} ≈ 1.4427. Therefore, log₂(1.4427) ≈ 0.53. Therefore, g(t) = 0.4427 - 0.53 ≈ -0.0873. So the minimum value of g(t) on [0,1) is approximately -0.0873. Therefore, each term a_n(x) is bounded below by -0.0873 and above by 0.\n\nTherefore, the sum over n of a_n(x) is a sum of terms each bounded between -0.0873 and 0. The total sum is then bounded between -0.0873 * ∞ and 0, which still suggests it could go to -infty. But this contradicts the requirement that f(x) is bounded. Therefore, there must be a mistake in this approach.\n\nWait, but earlier analysis showed that for each x in [0,1), the series sum_{n=0}^\\infty [x^{2ⁿ} - log₂(1 + x^{2ⁿ}})] converges. Because each term is O(x^{2ⁿ}), and the sum of x^{2ⁿ} converges. But even though each term is negative, the sum of negative terms that decay exponentially would converge to a finite negative value. Therefore, f(x) is equal to this convergent sum, and thus is finite for each x. But the problem is to show that it's bounded on the entire interval [0,1), not just convergent for each x.\n\nSo we need to find a uniform bound for all x in [0,1). To do this, maybe we can analyze the maximum and minimum of f(x) over [0,1). Let's check the behavior of f(x) as x approaches 1 and as x approaches 0.\n\nAs x approaches 0: f(x) = log₂(1 - x) + x + x² + x⁴ + ... ≈ log₂(1 - 0) + 0 + 0 + ... = 0. However, using the expansion log₂(1 - x) ≈ -x/ln2 - x²/(2 ln2) - ... So f(x) ≈ (-x/ln2) + x + x² + x⁴ + ... ≈ x(1 - 1/ln2) + x²(1 - 1/(2 ln2)) + ... Since 1 - 1/ln2 ≈ -0.4427, the leading term is negative, so f(x) approaches 0 from below as x approaches 0.\n\nAs x approaches 1 from below: f(x) = log₂(1 - x) + S(x). log₂(1 - x) tends to -infty, but S(x) = sum x^{2ⁿ}. Let's evaluate S(x) near x=1. For x approaching 1, x^{2ⁿ} approaches 1 for each fixed n, but as n increases, x^{2ⁿ} decreases rapidly to 0. For example, take x=1 - ε, where ε is small. Then x^{2ⁿ} ≈ e^{-ε 2ⁿ} using the approximation ln x ≈ -ε for small ε. So x^{2ⁿ} ≈ e^{-ε 2ⁿ}. Therefore, each term x^{2ⁿ} is approximately e^{-ε 2ⁿ}, which decays exponentially in n for fixed ε. Therefore, S(x) ≈ sum_{n=0}^\\infty e^{-ε 2ⁿ}. This is similar to a sum that converges to a value dependent on ε. As ε approaches 0 (x approaches 1), the sum S(x) behaves like sum_{n=0}^\\infty e^{-ε 2ⁿ}. \n\nTo approximate this sum, we can consider the terms where ε 2ⁿ is small. The terms transition from 1 to 0 around n ≈ log2(1/ε). So the number of terms that are approximately 1 is roughly log2(1/ε), and the rest decay exponentially. Therefore, S(x) ≈ log2(1/ε) + O(1). But log2(1/ε) is approximately log2(1/(1 - x)) since ε = 1 - x. \n\nMeanwhile, log₂(1 - x) = log₂(ε) = - log2(1/ε). Therefore, f(x) = log2(ε) + S(x) ≈ -log2(1/ε) + log2(1/ε) + O(1) = O(1). So the leading terms cancel out, leaving a bounded remainder. This suggests that as x approaches 1, f(x) approaches a finite limit.\n\nLet me make this more precise. Suppose x = 1 - ε, with ε → 0+. Then S(x) = sum_{n=0}^\\infty (1 - ε)^{2ⁿ}. \n\nWe can approximate each term (1 - ε)^{2ⁿ} ≈ e^{-ε 2ⁿ}. Therefore, S(x) ≈ sum_{n=0}^\\infty e^{-ε 2ⁿ}. Let’s analyze this sum. Let’s change variables to k = n - m, where m is the smallest integer such that ε 2^m ≥ 1. Wait, but perhaps it's better to approximate the sum by an integral. \n\nLet’s approximate the sum sum_{n=0}^\\infty e^{-ε 2ⁿ} ≈ integral_{n=0}^\\infty e^{-ε 2ⁿ} dn. Let’s substitute t = 2ⁿ, so dn = dt/(t ln 2). Then the integral becomes integral_{t=1}^\\infty e^{-ε t} / (t ln 2) dt = (1/ln 2) ∫_{1}^\\infty e^{-ε t}/t dt = (1/ln 2) E₁(ε), where E₁ is the exponential integral function. For small ε, E₁(ε) ≈ -γ - ln ε + ε - ... where γ is Euler-Mascheroni constant. Therefore, S(x) ≈ (1/ln 2)( - ln ε - γ + ... ). But log₂(1 - x) = log₂(ε) = ln ε / ln 2. Therefore, f(x) = log₂(ε) + S(x) ≈ (ln ε)/ln2 + (1/ln2)( - ln ε - γ ) = (ln ε)/ln2 - (ln ε)/ln2 - γ/ln2 + ... = - γ/ln2 + ... Therefore, as ε → 0+, f(x) approaches -γ/ln2 ≈ -0.577/0.693 ≈ -0.832. This suggests that as x approaches 1, f(x) approaches approximately -0.832.\n\nOn the other hand, as x approaches 0, f(x) approaches 0 from below, as we saw earlier. Therefore, the function f(x) might attain its maximum at x=0 (value 0) and approaches approximately -0.832 near x=1, and possibly has some variation in between. But we need to confirm that there are no other extrema in (0,1).\n\nTo check if f(x) has any local maxima or minima in (0,1), we can compute its derivative and set it to zero. \n\nThe derivative f’(x) = d/dx [log₂(1 - x) + sum_{n=0}^\\infty x^{2ⁿ}].\n\nDifferentiating term by term:\n\nd/dx log₂(1 - x) = -1/( (1 - x) ln 2 )\n\nDerivative of the sum S(x) = sum_{n=0}^\\infty x^{2ⁿ} is S’(x) = sum_{n=0}^\\infty 2ⁿ x^{2ⁿ - 1}.\n\nTherefore, f’(x) = -1/( (1 - x) ln 2 ) + sum_{n=0}^\\infty 2ⁿ x^{2ⁿ - 1}\n\nWe need to analyze the sign of f’(x). If we can show that f’(x) is always negative in (0,1), then f(x) is decreasing, attaining maximum at x=0 and minimum as x approaches 1. However, the approximate analysis near x=1 suggested f(x) approaches about -0.832, while at x=0, f(x)=0. So if f(x) is decreasing, then it's bounded between -0.832 and 0. \n\nBut let's check the derivative. For x in (0,1):\n\nf’(x) = -1/( (1 - x) ln 2 ) + sum_{n=0}^\\infty 2ⁿ x^{2ⁿ - 1}\n\nThe first term is negative, and the second term is positive. We need to compare their magnitudes.\n\nFor x close to 0:\n\nsum_{n=0}^\\infty 2ⁿ x^{2ⁿ - 1} = (1/x) sum_{n=0}^\\infty 2ⁿ x^{2ⁿ} = (1/x) sum_{n=0}^\\infty (2 x^{2ⁿ}/x^{2ⁿ - 1})) Hmm, maybe not helpful. Alternatively, note that when x is near 0, the dominant term in the sum is when n=0: 2⁰ x^{2⁰ -1} = 1 * x^{-1} = 1/x. Then n=1 term: 2¹ x^{2¹ -1} = 2 x. So the sum is approximately 1/x + 2x + higher terms. Therefore, f’(x) ≈ -1/( (1 - x) ln2 ) + 1/x + 2x. For x near 0, this approximates to -1/(ln2) (since (1 - x) ≈1) + 1/x + 0. So f’(x) ≈ -1/0.693 + 1/x. Since 1/x approaches infinity as x→0+, f’(x) → +infty. Therefore, near x=0, the derivative is positive, meaning f(x) is increasing. Wait, but earlier we thought that near x=0, f(x) approaches 0 from below, which would require that for x near 0, f(x) is negative and increasing towards 0. Let's compute f(x) for small x:\n\nTake x=0.1:\n\nf(0.1) = log₂(0.9) + 0.1 + 0.01 + 0.0001 + ... ≈ (-0.152) + 0.1 + 0.01 + 0.0001 + ... ≈ -0.152 + 0.1101 ≈ -0.0419\n\nx=0.2:\n\nlog₂(0.8) ≈ -0.3219 + 0.2 + 0.04 + 0.0016 + ... ≈ -0.3219 + 0.2416 ≈ -0.0803\n\nx=0.05:\n\nlog₂(0.95) ≈ -0.074 + 0.05 + 0.0025 + ... ≈ -0.074 + 0.0525 ≈ -0.0215\n\nWait, this suggests that for x=0.1, f(x) is ≈ -0.0419, which is greater than f(0.2)≈ -0.0803. So f(x) seems to be decreasing as x increases from 0. But according to the derivative analysis, near x=0, the derivative is positive, implying that f(x) is increasing. But the numerical examples show that f(x) becomes more negative as x increases from 0 to 0.2, which would suggest the derivative is negative. This contradiction indicates a mistake in my derivative calculation.\n\nWait, let's re-express S’(x). S(x) = sum_{n=0}^\\infty x^{2ⁿ}. The derivative term by term is sum_{n=0}^\\infty 2ⁿ x^{2ⁿ -1}. For example, when n=0: derivative is 1 * x^{-1 +1} = x^0 =1. When n=1: 2 x^{1}, n=2:4 x^{3}, etc. Wait, no. Wait, d/dx x^{2ⁿ} = 2ⁿ x^{2ⁿ -1}. Therefore, for n=0: 2⁰ x^{2⁰ -1} = x^{-0} = x^{-0}? Wait, no. Wait, 2ⁿ is the exponent. So d/dx x^{2ⁿ} = 2ⁿ x^{2ⁿ -1}. So for n=0, derivative term is 1 * x^{1 -1} = x^0 =1. For n=1, derivative term is 2 x^{2 -1}=2x. For n=2, derivative term is4 x^{4 -1}=4x³. So S’(x) = 1 + 2x +4x³ +8x⁷ + ... \n\nTherefore, S’(x) = sum_{n=0}^\\infty 2ⁿ x^{2ⁿ -1}. For x near 0, the dominant term is 1 (from n=0), then 2x, etc. Therefore, S’(x) ≈1 + 2x +4x³ +... \n\nThus, f’(x) = -1/( (1 - x) ln2 ) + 1 + 2x +4x³ +... \n\nAt x=0.1:\n\nf’(0.1) ≈ -1/(0.9 * 0.693) +1 +0.2 +0.004 + ... ≈ -1/(0.6237) +1.204 ≈ -1.603 +1.204 ≈ -0.399\n\nNegative derivative, so f decreasing.\n\nAt x=0.01:\n\nf’(0.01) ≈ -1/(0.99 * 0.693) +1 +0.02 +0.000004 +... ≈ -1/0.686 +1.020004 ≈ -1.457 +1.020 ≈ -0.437\n\nNegative derivative.\n\nEarlier mistake was in thinking that for n=0, the derivative term is 1/x. But actually, for n=0, the derivative is 1 * x^{0} =1. Therefore, S’(x) starts at 1 and increases as x increases. Therefore, for x near 0, f’(x) ≈ -1/(ln2) +1 + ... ≈ -1.4427 +1 = -0.4427, which is negative. Therefore, the derivative is negative near x=0, meaning f(x) is decreasing there. This matches the numerical examples where increasing x from 0 to 0.1 makes f(x) more negative.\n\nSimilarly, let's check near x approaching 1. For x near 1, say x=0.99:\n\nf’(x) = -1/(0.01 * 0.693) + sum_{n=0}^\\infty 2ⁿ (0.99)^{2ⁿ -1}.\n\nThe first term is -1/(0.00693) ≈ -144.3.\n\nThe sum S’(x) = sum_{n=0}^\\infty 2ⁿ (0.99)^{2ⁿ -1}. Let's compute a few terms:\n\nn=0: 1 * (0.99)^{-1} ≈1.0101\n\nn=1:2 * (0.99)^{1} ≈1.98\n\nn=2:4 * (0.99)^{3}≈4 * 0.9703≈3.881\n\nn=3:8 * (0.99)^{7}≈8 * 0.932065≈7.4565\n\nn=4:16 * (0.99)^{15}≈16 * 0.860058≈13.7609\n\nn=5:32 * (0.99)^{31}≈32 * (0.99)^31≈32 * 0.7339≈23.4848\n\nn=6:64 * (0.99)^{63}≈64 * (0.99)^63≈64 * 0.532≈34.048\n\nn=7:128 * (0.99)^{127}≈128 * (0.99)^127≈128 * 0.280≈35.84\n\nn=8:256 * (0.99)^{255}≈256 * (0.99)^255≈256 * 0.077≈19.712\n\nn=9:512 * (0.99)^{511}≈512 * (0.99)^511≈512 * 0.0059≈3.0208\n\nn=10:1024 * (0.99)^{1023}≈1024 * (0.99)^{1023}≈1024 * very small ≈0\n\nSo summing these terms up to n=9 gives approximately:\n\n1.01 +1.98 +3.88 +7.46 +13.76 +23.48 +34.05 +35.84 +19.71 +3.02 ≈ 143.19\n\nAdding the remaining terms (n=10 onwards) which are negligible, total sum≈143.19 + negligible ≈143.2.\n\nTherefore, f’(0.99) ≈ -144.3 +143.2 ≈ -1.1. So derivative is negative at x=0.99.\n\nAt x approaching 1, the sum S’(x) approaches sum_{n=0}^\\infty 2ⁿ *1^{2ⁿ -1} = sum_{n=0}^\\infty 2ⁿ = infinity. But for x=1 - ε, with ε→0+, the terms in the sum S’(x) start to diverge, but because x^{2ⁿ -1} decays exponentially for large n. However, as x approaches 1, more terms contribute significantly before the decay kicks in. But in the example above, even at x=0.99, the sum S’(x)≈143.2, which is still less than 144.3, leading to a negative derivative. Therefore, it's possible that for all x in [0,1), f’(x) is negative, meaning f(x) is strictly decreasing on [0,1). Therefore, the maximum value is at x=0 (which is 0), and the infimum is the limit as x approaches 1, which we approximated as approximately -0.832. Therefore, f(x) is bounded between -0.832 and 0.\n\nBut to rigorously prove that f(x) is bounded, we need to show that the limit as x approaches 1 of f(x) exists and is finite. Earlier analysis suggested that f(x) approaches approximately -γ/ln2 ≈ -0.832. Therefore, f(x) is bounded below by this value and above by 0.\n\nAlternatively, using the functional equation and the expression f(x) = sum_{n=0}^\\infty [x^{2ⁿ} - log₂(1 + x^{2ⁿ}}). Since each term is bounded between -0.0873 and 0, and the series converges uniformly, the sum is bounded by the sum of the maximum term bounds. However, since the sum is infinite, this approach isn't directly helpful. Instead, since the series converges absolutely and uniformly on [0,1), and each term is bounded, the sum is bounded.\n\nBut to make this precise, perhaps we can bound each term a_n(x) = x^{2ⁿ} - log₂(1 + x^{2ⁿ}}). We can use the inequality ln(1 + t) ≤ t for t > -1. Since log₂(1 + t) = ln(1 + t)/ln2 ≤ t/ln2. Therefore, x^{2ⁿ} - log₂(1 + x^{2ⁿ}}) ≥ x^{2ⁿ} - x^{2ⁿ}/ln2 = x^{2ⁿ}(1 - 1/ln2). Since 1 - 1/ln2 ≈ -0.4427, this gives a lower bound. For an upper bound, since log₂(1 + t) ≥ t - t²/(2 ln2) for t ≥0 (from the Taylor series), so x^{2ⁿ} - log₂(1 + x^{2ⁿ}}) ≤ x^{2ⁿ} - [x^{2ⁿ}/ln2 - x^{4ⁿ}/(2 ln2)] = x^{2ⁿ}(1 - 1/ln2) + x^{4ⁿ}/(2 ln2). Since 1 - 1/ln2 is negative, this gives an upper bound less than x^{4ⁿ}/(2 ln2). But this might not help.\n\nAlternatively, for t in [0,1], consider the function g(t) = t - log₂(1 + t). We can find an upper bound and lower bound for g(t). As previously found, g(t) has a minimum of approximately -0.0873 at t ≈0.4427, and g(0)=0, g(1)=0. Therefore, |g(t)| ≤0.0873 for t in [0,1]. Therefore, each term a_n(x) = g(x^{2ⁿ}) is bounded in absolute value by 0.0873. Therefore, the sum |f(x)| ≤ sum_{n=0}^\\infty |g(x^{2ⁿ}})| ≤ sum_{n=0}^\\infty 0.0873 = infinity. Wait, that can't be. So this approach also fails.\n\nHowever, note that the terms a_n(x) = g(x^{2ⁿ}) decay exponentially because x^{2ⁿ} decays doubly exponentially. For example, for any x in [0,1), x^{2ⁿ} ≤ e^{-c 2ⁿ} for some c >0. Therefore, the terms a_n(x) are bounded in absolute value by C e^{-c 2ⁿ}, leading to a convergent series whose sum is bounded by a constant independent of x. Therefore, the sum f(x) = sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n(x) converges absolutely and uniformly on [0,1), and thus is bounded.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the fact that the sum converges uniformly, so f(x) is continuous on [0,1). Since [0,1) is a compact interval if we include the limit point x=1, but technically [0,1) is not compact. However, if we extend f(x) to x=1 by taking the limit, which exists, then f(x) would be continuous on [0,1] and hence bounded. But since the problem states x in [0,1), we need to ensure boundedness without assuming extension to x=1.\n\nBut since f(x) approaches a finite limit as x approaches 1, and is continuous on [0,1), it must be bounded. Because for x near 1, f(x) is close to the limit, and on [0,1-ε], f(x) is continuous and hence bounded. Therefore, combining these, f(x) is bounded on [0,1).\n\nThus, the key steps are:\n\n1. Use the functional equation to express f(x) as a convergent series.\n\n2. Show that the series converges uniformly, hence f(x) is continuous on [0,1).\n\n3. Show that the limit as x approaches 1 is finite.\n\n4. Conclude that f(x) is bounded.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that f(x) is bounded on [0,1).",
