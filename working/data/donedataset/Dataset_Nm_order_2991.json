    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so the user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. Let me start by understanding the problem presented.\n\nThe original question is about the Fourier transform of a real function. The user mentions that when they compute the Fourier transform of the function x ↦ 1/(x² - 2x + 2), they end up with a result that has a non-zero imaginary part. They're confused because they believe the Fourier transform of a real function should be real, which contradicts their result. They also ask for a proof of that statement.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem. The example given in the prompt shows that assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. \n\nLooking at the problem, the key assumptions here are:\n1. The function in question is real-valued. The user is working with a real function, so that's one assumption.\n2. The Fourier transform of a real function should be real. Wait, but the user is questioning this. However, the actual property is that the Fourier transform of a real and even function is real, but in general, for a real function, the Fourier transform is complex but has Hermitian symmetry. So maybe the user has a misunderstanding here. But the problem statement as per the user's question includes their assumption that the Fourier transform should be real, so that's part of their initial assumption.\n\nWait, but the user is asking why their result has an imaginary part, implying they thought the FT should be real. So the assumption from their side is that the Fourier transform of a real function is real. However, that's actually incorrect. The correct property is that the Fourier transform of a real function is Hermitian symmetric, meaning the real part is even and the imaginary part is odd. Therefore, the user might be making a mistake here, but their assumption is that the FT should be real. However, in reality, the FT of a real function isn't necessarily real unless additional conditions like evenness are met.\n\nBut according to the example given in the prompt, the assumption includes the conditions given in the problem. In the example, the original problem states that A(n) is divisible by 91, and in the formatted version, the assumption includes that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, it was \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That might be a mistake in the example. Wait, maybe the example is wrong, but the user provided it, so I need to follow their structure.\n\nWait, maybe in the example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91\", and the formatted assumption lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems conflicting because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption adds a condition that n is divisible by 7. That suggests that maybe the example is incorrect, but the user might have intended that. So perhaps the user made an error in their example, but in any case, I need to follow the structure they want.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user's question is that they tried to compute the Fourier transform of a real function and got a non-zero imaginary part, which contradicts their belief that the FT of a real function should be real. Therefore, their assumption is that the function is real, and that the FT should be real. But in reality, that's not true unless the function is also even. So the problem here is that the user is under the mistaken assumption that the FT of any real function is real, which is not correct.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. So in this case, the problem's assumptions would be:\n\n1. The function x ↦ 1/(x² - 2x + 2) is real-valued.\n2. The Fourier transform of a real function is real.\n\nBut actually, the second point is the user's incorrect assumption. However, in the problem statement, the user is asking why their calculation gives an imaginary part, implying that they thought the FT should be real. So the assumptions here would be the function is real, and the user's belief that the FT should be real. But since the actual answer is that the FT is not necessarily real, but has Hermitian symmetry, the problem as posed by the user is based on a false premise. However, the user is asking for a proof that the FT of a real function is real, which is actually not true. So there's a mistake in their understanding.\n\nBut the task is to structure the problem as per the example. The example included both the correct and possibly incorrect assumptions. In the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That seems like an error, but perhaps the example was for a different problem where n is divisible by 7, but the original problem statement had a different condition.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's question is: They have a real function (their first assumption), and they believe that its FT should be real (second assumption), but their calculation shows otherwise, so they must be making a mistake. They then ask for a proof that the FT of a real function is real.\n\nBut since the actual fact is that the FT of a real function is not necessarily real, the problem as posed by the user contains a false assumption. However, the task is to structure their problem as per the given format, so the assumptions would include:\n\n- The function x ↦ 1/(x² - 2x +2) is real.\n- The Fourier transform of a real function should be real.\n\nBut the problem is that the user's calculation gives a non-zero imaginary part, which contradicts their assumption. They are asking where the mistake is and for a proof of their assumption (which is incorrect). So the formatted problem should capture their assumptions and their problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the actual problem to structure is the user's implicit question: \"Why does the Fourier transform of my real function have an imaginary part?\" and \"Is the Fourier transform of a real function real? If so, provide a proof; if not, explain why.\"\n\nBut according to the example, the formatted problem should list the assumptions and then the problem. The original problem here is the user's question, so the problem part would be \"Prove that the Fourier transform of a real function is real\" (since the user thinks it should be real) and also explain why their calculation shows otherwise.\n\nBut maybe the problem should be split into two parts: the user's mistake and the proof. However, the example seems to take the problem as stated and extract the assumptions. So perhaps in this case, the assumptions are:\n\n1. The function x ↦ 1/(x² - 2x +2) is real.\n2. The Fourier transform of a real function is real.\n\nBut the user is experiencing a contradiction, so the problem is to resolve this: either show that the FT is indeed real (which it's not) or explain why their calculation has an imaginary part. However, the user explicitly asks: \"What is a proof that the Fourier transform of a real function is real?\"\n\nBut since such a proof doesn't exist (because the statement is false), perhaps the formatted problem should capture the user's underlying question, which is based on a misunderstanding. But the task is to structure the problem as per the user's original question, not to correct it. Therefore, the assumptions would include that the function is real and that the user believes the FT should be real. The problem is to either prove the FT is real (which is not true) or explain the mistake.\n\nBut the example shows that the formatted problem includes the problem statement as given, with the assumptions. So the problem here is: \"Prove that the Fourier transform of a real function is real\" because that's what the user is asking. The user's own problem with the specific function is part of the context but might not be part of the formatted problem. Wait, the original question is two parts: the specific example and the general proof. The user says: \"I keep getting something with non-zero imaginary part. But the Fourier transform of a real function should be real, right? So I must be making a mistake? What is a proof that the Fourier transform of a real function is real?\"\n\nSo the user's main problem is the general proof, but their specific example is causing confusion. However, the task is to format the problem into assumptions and the problem statement. The example given in the prompt includes the specific function in the problem part. So perhaps in this case:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The function x ↦ 1/(x² - 2x +2) is real.\n- The Fourier transform of a real function is real.\n\nProblem: Prove that the Fourier transform of a real function is real, and explain why the calculation for the given function yields a non-zero imaginary part.\n\nBut the example in the prompt shows that the problem part is just the problem statement, not including explanations. The example's problem is \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" So perhaps here the problem is \"Prove that the Fourier transform of a real function is real,\" as the user is asking for that proof. However, since the user is mistaken, the actual problem is to address their confusion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is structured as follows:\n\nAssumption:\n- The function x ↦ 1/(x² - 2x +2) is real.\n\nProblem: Determine why the Fourier transform of this function has a non-zero imaginary part, given that the Fourier transform of a real function is supposed to be real.\n\nBut the user is also asking for a proof of the (incorrect) statement. So perhaps the formatted problem should capture both aspects. However, the example seems to take the main problem statement. Given the user's question, the main problem they want answered is \"What is a proof that the Fourier transform of a real function is real?\" even though that statement is false. Therefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The function is real (for their specific example).\n- The Fourier transform of a real function is real (their belief).\n\nProblem: Prove that the Fourier transform of a real function is real.\n\nBut in reality, the correct property is that the Fourier transform of a real function is complex conjugate symmetric. So the problem as posed by the user is based on a false premise. However, the task is to structure the problem as per the user's original question, not to correct it. Therefore, the assumptions would include the function being real and the user's belief that the FT should be real, and the problem is to provide a proof of that (which doesn't exist, but that's what they're asking).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to resolve the contradiction in their calculation, which would involve explaining why the FT isn't real, but the user is explicitly asking for a proof. So the formatted problem should capture their explicit request for a proof.\n\nIn the example provided by the user, the original problem had a mistake in the assumptions (adding that n is divisible by 7 when the original problem stated \"for every integer n\"), so perhaps the example is not perfect, but we need to follow the format.\n\nTherefore, in this case, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The function x ↦ 1/(x² - 2x +2) is real.\n- The Fourier transform of a real function should be real.\n\nProblem: Prove that the Fourier transform of a real function is real.\n\nBut the user's specific example is part of the context but perhaps not part of the formatted problem. However, the user does mention their specific function, so maybe it should be included.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be structured with the specific function:\n\nAssumption:\n- The function f(x) = 1/(x² - 2x +2) is real.\n\nProblem: Prove that the Fourier transform of f(x) is real, and explain why the calculation yields a non-zero imaginary part.\n\nBut the user is asking two things: why their calculation has an imaginary part and for a proof that FT of a real function is real. However, the example in the prompt includes the specific function in the problem statement, so maybe here the problem part should include both the general proof request and the specific function issue.\n\nBut perhaps the main problem is the general proof, so the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The function is real.\n\nProblem: Prove that the Fourier transform of a real function is real.\n\nBut the user's specific function is part of their motivation, but the actual problem they're asking to be proven is the general statement. Therefore, the formatted problem would capture that general statement.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The function is real.\n- The Fourier transform of a real function is real.\n\nProblem: Prove that the Fourier transform of a real function is real.\n\nHowever, the second assumption is actually the user's belief, not a given condition. But according to the example, assumptions are the conditions of the problem. In the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which becomes an assumption that n is an integer. Then, in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" which wasn't in the original problem. That suggests that maybe the example is incorrect, but following that pattern, perhaps here we need to list the assumptions as per the problem's conditions. But the original problem here is the user's question, which includes their belief that the FT should be real. However, since the example includes assumptions that may not all be present in the original problem, perhaps I need to list all the conditions that are part of the problem.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is \"n is an integer\". But the formatted problem in the example adds \"n is divisible by 7\", which is not in the original problem. This seems like an error. Perhaps the user intended to modify the problem, but that's unclear. However, following the example's approach, perhaps the assumptions are all the conditions given in the problem. In the current case, the problem the user is facing is that they have a real function, and they believe the FT should be real. So the assumptions are:\n\n1. The function f(x) = 1/(x² - 2x + 2) is real.\n2. The Fourier transform of a real function is real.\n\nProblem: Explain why the Fourier transform of f(x) has a non-zero imaginary part, given that the Fourier transform of a real function should be real.\n\nBut the user is also asking for a proof of the general statement. However, the example includes the problem statement as given, so perhaps the formatted problem should be the user's question as is. The user's question is: \"What is a proof that the Fourier transform of a real function is real?\" So the assumptions would be:\n\n- The function is real.\n\nProblem: Prove that the Fourier transform of a real function is real.\n\nBut since the user's specific example is part of their motivation, maybe it's included in the problem statement. In the example, the problem includes the specific A(n) expression. Similarly, here, the problem could include the specific function.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is structured as:\n\nAssumption:\n- The function f(x) = 1/(x² - 2x +2) is real.\n\nProblem: Prove that the Fourier transform of f(x) is real.\n\nBut the user's confusion is that they computed it and found an imaginary part. So the problem is to either prove it's real (which it's not) or explain the discrepancy. But the user is asking for a proof of the general statement. Therefore, the main problem to structure is the general proof request.\n\nIn conclusion, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n- The function is real.\n\nProblem: Prove that the Fourier transform of a real function is real.\n\nBut the user's specific function is part of the context but not part of the formatted problem. However, since the user mentions it, maybe it's included. The example included the specific expression in the problem statement. So following that:\n\nProblem: Prove that the Fourier transform of the real function $$x \\mapsto \\frac1{x^2 - 2x  +2}$$ is real, and explain why the calculation yields a non-zero imaginary part.\n\nBut that's combining two parts. Alternatively, the problem is the general statement, and the specific function is part of the motivation. Given the example, the formatted problem includes the specific function in the problem statement. So I think the correct formatted problem is:\n\nAssumption:\n- The function $$x \\mapsto \\frac1{x^2 - 2x  +2}$$ is real.\n\nProblem: Prove that its Fourier transform is real, and explain why the calculation yields a non-zero imaginary part.\n\nBut the user's main question is also about the general case. They ask: \"What is a proof that the Fourier transform of a real function is real?\" So perhaps two separate problems, but the format seems to allow one problem per instance. Given that, the formatted problem should capture both aspects. However, the example only addresses one problem. Given the complexity, I think the best approach is to structure the problem as the general proof request, with the assumption that the function is real.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\n- The function is real.\n\nProblem: Prove that the Fourier transform of a real function is real.\n\nBut then, the user's specific example is separate. However, since the example in the prompt includes the specific function in the problem statement, perhaps here it should be included as well. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- The function $$f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2 - 2x + 2}$$ is real.\n\nProblem: Prove that the Fourier transform of f(x) is real.\n\nBut this is incorrect because the FT of this function is not real. However, the user is operating under the assumption that it should be. The formatted problem would reflect the user's question as posed, even if it's based on a misunderstanding. Therefore, the assumptions include that the function is real, and the problem is to prove its FT is real. The user's miscalculation is part of the context but not part of the formatted problem.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be to resolve the contradiction, but the user explicitly asks for a proof. Therefore, the final answer should be structured as:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nThe function \\( x \\mapsto \\frac{1}{x^2 - 2x + 2} \\) is real,\nThe Fourier transform of a real function is real.\nProblem: \nProve that the Fourier transform of a real function is real.",
