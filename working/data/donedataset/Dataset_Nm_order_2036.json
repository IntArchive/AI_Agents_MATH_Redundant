    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem step by step. The question is to prove that (1 + sin6° + cos12°) divided by (cos6° + sin12°) equals √3. Hmm, trigonometric identities can be tricky, but maybe there's a way to simplify the numerator and denominator separately or find a common angle to work with.\n\nFirst, let me write down the expression again:\n\n(1 + sin6° + cos12°) / (cos6° + sin12°) = √3\n\nI need to verify if this equality holds. The user mentioned that using exact values for sin6° and cos6° leads to complicated expressions, so perhaps there's a smarter approach using trigonometric identities instead of plugging in those messy values.\n\nLet me recall some trigonometric identities that might help. The sum formulas, angle addition, maybe some product-to-sum or sum-to-product identities. Also, sometimes multiplying numerator and denominator by a conjugate can help simplify things.\n\nLooking at the numerator: 1 + sin6° + cos12°. The denominator: cos6° + sin12°. Both have terms with 6° and 12°, which are multiples of 6°. Maybe I can express everything in terms of 6° or 12° to find a pattern.\n\nFirst, let's note that 12° is 2*6°, so perhaps double-angle identities could come into play. For example, sin12° is sin(2*6°) = 2 sin6° cos6°, which the user already mentioned. Similarly, cos12° can be written as 2cos²6° - 1. Let me try substituting these into the original expression.\n\nStarting with the numerator:\n\n1 + sin6° + cos12° = 1 + sin6° + (2cos²6° - 1) = sin6° + 2cos²6°\n\nThe 1 and -1 cancel out, so that simplifies the numerator to sin6° + 2cos²6°.\n\nDenominator:\n\ncos6° + sin12° = cos6° + 2 sin6° cos6° = cos6°(1 + 2 sin6°)\n\nSo now the expression becomes [sin6° + 2cos²6°] / [cos6°(1 + 2 sin6°)]\n\nHmm, maybe factor the numerator? Let's see:\n\nsin6° + 2cos²6° = sin6° + 2(1 - sin²6°) = sin6° + 2 - 2 sin²6°\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe factor out a cos6° from the numerator? Let's see:\n\nsin6° + 2cos²6° = cos6° (tan6° + 2 cos6°)\n\nBut that might not lead anywhere. Alternatively, let's try to express the numerator in terms of sin6° and cos6°.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let's denote θ = 6°, so that 12° = 2θ. Then the expression becomes:\n\n[1 + sinθ + cos2θ] / [cosθ + sin2θ] = √3\n\nExpressing everything in terms of θ:\n\nNumerator: 1 + sinθ + cos2θ\n\nDenominator: cosθ + sin2θ\n\nWe know that cos2θ = 1 - 2sin²θ or 2cos²θ - 1. Let's use 2cos²θ - 1 for cos2θ:\n\nNumerator becomes: 1 + sinθ + 2cos²θ - 1 = sinθ + 2cos²θ\n\nDenominator: cosθ + 2 sinθ cosθ = cosθ (1 + 2 sinθ)\n\nSo now, the expression is (sinθ + 2cos²θ) / [cosθ (1 + 2 sinθ)]\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\nsinθ + 2cos²θ = sinθ + 2(1 - sin²θ) = sinθ + 2 - 2 sin²θ\n\nBut maybe instead, let's try to write numerator as a combination that could factor with denominator. Let's see:\n\nNumerator: sinθ + 2cos²θ\n\nDenominator: cosθ (1 + 2 sinθ)\n\nLet me divide numerator and denominator by cosθ:\n\nNumerator: (sinθ + 2cos²θ)/cosθ = tanθ + 2 cosθ\n\nDenominator: 1 + 2 sinθ\n\nSo the expression becomes [tanθ + 2 cosθ] / (1 + 2 sinθ)\n\nHmm, not sure. Let's plug θ = 6°, so tan6° is a value, but maybe this isn't helpful. Alternatively, perhaps express tanθ as sinθ / cosθ:\n\n[ (sinθ / cosθ) + 2 cosθ ] / (1 + 2 sinθ ) = [ (sinθ + 2 cos²θ ) / cosθ ] / (1 + 2 sinθ ) which brings us back to where we were.\n\nAlternatively, maybe cross-multiplying to see if (sinθ + 2cos²θ) equals √3 cosθ (1 + 2 sinθ). If the original equation is true, then:\n\nsinθ + 2cos²θ = √3 cosθ (1 + 2 sinθ)\n\nLet me expand the right-hand side:\n\n√3 cosθ + 2√3 sinθ cosθ\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\nsinθ + 2cos²θ = √3 cosθ + 2√3 sinθ cosθ\n\nLet me bring everything to one side:\n\nsinθ + 2cos²θ - √3 cosθ - 2√3 sinθ cosθ = 0\n\nHmm, this might not be helpful. Maybe another identity. Let's think about the angle addition. For example, 6° + 12° = 18°, which is a known angle. Alternatively, 6° is 30° - 24°, but that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use auxiliary angles. Suppose we consider the numerator and denominator as expressions that can be written in terms of sine or cosine of some angle.\n\nAlternatively, think of the entire fraction as tan(α) for some angle α, which would be √3. Since tan(60°) = √3, maybe α = 60°, so perhaps the fraction is tan(60°), so maybe the numerator is √3 times the denominator. Let me check that.\n\nIf (1 + sin6° + cos12°) = √3 (cos6° + sin12°), then the equation holds. Let me compute both sides numerically to verify.\n\nFirst, compute the left-hand side (LHS): 1 + sin6° + cos12°\n\nUsing approximate values:\n\nsin6° ≈ 0.104528\n\ncos12° ≈ 0.978148\n\nSo LHS ≈ 1 + 0.104528 + 0.978148 ≈ 2.082676\n\nRight-hand side (RHS): √3 (cos6° + sin12°)\n\ncos6° ≈ 0.994522\n\nsin12° ≈ 0.207912\n\nSo cos6° + sin12° ≈ 0.994522 + 0.207912 ≈ 1.202434\n\nMultiply by √3 ≈ 1.73205: 1.202434 * 1.73205 ≈ 2.082, which matches the LHS. So numerically, it checks out. Therefore, the identity is correct.\n\nBut the task is to prove it analytically. Let's try another approach. Maybe express all terms in terms of sin and cos of 6°, and then manipulate.\n\nWe know that:\n\ncos12° = 2cos²6° - 1\n\nsin12° = 2 sin6° cos6°\n\nSubstituting these into the original expression:\n\nNumerator: 1 + sin6° + (2cos²6° - 1) = sin6° + 2cos²6°\n\nDenominator: cos6° + 2 sin6° cos6° = cos6°(1 + 2 sin6°)\n\nSo the fraction becomes:\n\n[sin6° + 2cos²6°] / [cos6°(1 + 2 sin6°)]\n\nLet me factor the numerator. Maybe factor out a cos6°:\n\nsin6° + 2cos²6° = cos6° (tan6° + 2 cos6°)\n\nBut tan6° = sin6°/cos6°, so that's back to original. Alternatively, let's see:\n\nsin6° + 2cos²6° = 2cos²6° + sin6°\n\nMaybe express sin6° in terms of cos6°, but that might not help. Alternatively, use the identity sinθ = cos(90° - θ). But 90° - 6° = 84°, which isn't helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider writing 2cos²6° as 1 + cos12°, but wait, cos12° is already part of the original numerator. Hmm, not helpful.\n\nWait, here's an idea: Let me write the numerator as sin6° + 2cos²6° = sin6° + 2(1 - sin²6°) = sin6° + 2 - 2 sin²6°.\n\nBut then the numerator is -2 sin²6° + sin6° + 2. Let's denote x = sin6°, then the numerator becomes -2x² + x + 2, and the denominator is cos6°(1 + 2x). But this might not lead directly to a solution.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider rationalizing the fraction or using substitution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply numerator and denominator by some term to eliminate denominators or create known identities.\n\nAlternatively, think about the denominator: cos6° + sin12° = cos6° + sin(2*6°) = cos6° + 2 sin6° cos6° = cos6°(1 + 2 sin6°). So the denominator is already factored as cos6°(1 + 2 sin6°). Let's see if the numerator can be expressed in terms of (1 + 2 sin6°).\n\nNumerator: sin6° + 2cos²6°.\n\nLet me write cos²6° as (1 + cos12°)/2, so:\n\nNumerator = sin6° + 2*(1 + cos12°)/2 = sin6° + 1 + cos12°.\n\nBut wait, that's just 1 + sin6° + cos12°, which brings us back to the original numerator. So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use sum-to-product identities on the numerator and denominator. For example, 1 + sin6° + cos12° can be grouped as (1 + cos12°) + sin6°. Then, 1 + cos12° = 2cos²6°, which we already did. So we get 2cos²6° + sin6°, same as before.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider writing the entire fraction as √3. If I set the fraction equal to √3 and try to verify the identity:\n\n[sin6° + 2cos²6°] / [cos6°(1 + 2 sin6°)] = √3\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\nsin6° + 2cos²6° = √3 cos6°(1 + 2 sin6°)\n\nLet's expand the right-hand side:\n\n√3 cos6° + 2√3 sin6° cos6°\n\nNow, let's compute both sides:\n\nLeft-hand side (LHS): sin6° + 2cos²6°\n\nRight-hand side (RHS): √3 cos6° + 2√3 sin6° cos6°\n\nLet me rearrange the equation to bring all terms to one side:\n\nsin6° + 2cos²6° - √3 cos6° - 2√3 sin6° cos6° = 0\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe factor terms:\n\nGroup terms with cos6°:\n\ncos6°(2 cos6° - √3) + sin6°(1 - 2√3 cos6°) = 0\n\nNot sure if this helps. Alternatively, factor out common terms. Let me see:\n\nAlternatively, express 2cos²6° as 1 + cos12°, but we tried that already.\n\nWait, maybe use specific angle values. Let's recall that sin6° and cos6° can be related to known angles. For example, 6° is half of 12°, or a third of 18°, and 18° is related to the pentagon, so maybe there's a connection with the golden ratio. But that might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, use complex numbers. Let me express sine and cosine in terms of Euler's formula:\n\ne^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ\n\nBut I'm not sure if that will simplify things here.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the desired result is √3, which is tan60°. So perhaps if we can show that the angle whose tangent is the given fraction is 60°, which would imply the fraction equals √3.\n\nLet me denote the fraction as tanφ, where tanφ = [1 + sin6° + cos12°]/[cos6° + sin12°]. If we can show φ = 60°, then we're done.\n\nTo find φ, we can use the tangent addition formula or other angle addition identities. Alternatively, compute φ = arctan([1 + sin6° + cos12°]/[cos6° + sin12°]) and show it's 60°.\n\nBut this approach might require computing the arctangent, which is not helpful analytically.\n\nAlternatively, consider using the formula for tangent of a sum or difference. For example, if we can write the numerator and denominator as some sine and cosine of an angle, then their ratio would be tangent of that angle.\n\nAlternatively, think of the numerator and denominator as projections of vectors. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nLet me think differently. Suppose I let θ = 6°, so the equation becomes:\n\n(1 + sinθ + cos2θ)/(cosθ + sin2θ) = √3\n\nMultiply both sides by denominator:\n\n1 + sinθ + cos2θ = √3 (cosθ + sin2θ)\n\nNow, let's substitute cos2θ = 1 - 2 sin²θ:\n\n1 + sinθ + (1 - 2 sin²θ) = √3 (cosθ + 2 sinθ cosθ)\n\nSimplify left-hand side (LHS):\n\n1 + sinθ + 1 - 2 sin²θ = 2 + sinθ - 2 sin²θ\n\nRight-hand side (RHS):\n\n√3 cosθ + 2√3 sinθ cosθ\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n2 + sinθ - 2 sin²θ = √3 cosθ + 2√3 sinθ cosθ\n\nThis seems complicated. Let's rearrange terms:\n\n2 - 2 sin²θ = √3 cosθ + 2√3 sinθ cosθ - sinθ\n\nLeft side: 2(1 - sin²θ) = 2 cos²θ\n\nRight side: cosθ (√3 + 2√3 sinθ) - sinθ = cosθ (√3 (1 + 2 sinθ)) - sinθ\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n2 cos²θ = √3 cosθ (1 + 2 sinθ) - sinθ\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n2 cos²θ - √3 cosθ (1 + 2 sinθ) + sinθ = 0\n\nThis equation must hold for θ = 6°. It's quite specific, but maybe substituting θ = 6° and verifying.\n\nAlternatively, maybe factor this expression. Let's see:\n\nLet me factor terms with cosθ:\n\ncosθ [2 cosθ - √3 (1 + 2 sinθ)] + sinθ = 0\n\nNot helpful. Alternatively, perhaps express everything in terms of sinθ. Since cosθ = √(1 - sin²θ), but that would complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, let's plug in θ = 6° and check numerically:\n\nLeft side: 2 cos²6° - √3 cos6° (1 + 2 sin6°) + sin6°\n\nCompute each term:\n\ncos6° ≈ 0.994522\n\nsin6° ≈ 0.104528\n\nCompute 2 cos²6° ≈ 2*(0.994522)^2 ≈ 2*0.989075 ≈ 1.97815\n\nNext term: √3 cos6° (1 + 2 sin6°) ≈ 1.73205 * 0.994522 * (1 + 2*0.104528) ≈ 1.73205*0.994522*(1.209056)\n\nCalculate inside first: 0.994522*1.209056 ≈ 1.20243\n\nThen multiply by 1.73205: ≈ 2.082\n\nThen subtract this from 1.97815: 1.97815 - 2.082 ≈ -0.10385\n\nThen add sin6°: -0.10385 + 0.104528 ≈ 0.000678, which is approximately zero, considering rounding errors. So the equation holds numerically, which confirms the identity. But analytically, how to proceed?\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider the numerator and denominator as functions and see if their ratio is constant (√3). Maybe take the denominator times √3 and subtract the numerator to show it's zero.\n\nLet me compute √3*(cos6° + sin12°) - (1 + sin6° + cos12°) and see if it's zero.\n\nUsing approximate values:\n\n√3 ≈ 1.73205\n\ncos6° ≈ 0.994522\n\nsin12° ≈ 0.207912\n\nSo √3*(0.994522 + 0.207912) ≈ 1.73205*(1.202434) ≈ 2.082\n\n1 + sin6° + cos12° ≈ 1 + 0.104528 + 0.978148 ≈ 2.082676\n\nThe difference is about 2.082676 - 2.082 ≈ 0.000676, which is due to rounding errors. So this supports the identity.\n\nBut we need an analytical proof. Let's try using more identities.\n\nAnother idea: Use the sine and cosine of 6°, 12°, 18°, etc., which are related to each other. Maybe express everything in terms of 18°, since 6° is 18° - 12°, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that 6° = 30° - 24°, but that might not help. Alternatively, use sum and difference formulas.\n\nLet me try to write 1 + sin6° + cos12° as a sum of sines and cosines that can be combined. For example, 1 can be written as sin90°, but that might not help. Alternatively, use sum-to-product on sin6° + cos12°.\n\nWait, sinA + cosB = sinA + sin(90° - B). So sin6° + cos12° = sin6° + sin78°, since cos12° = sin(90° - 12°) = sin78°. Then, sin6° + sin78° can be combined using sum-to-product:\n\nsinA + sinB = 2 sin[(A+B)/2] cos[(A-B)/2]\n\nSo, sin6° + sin78° = 2 sin(42°) cos(36°)\n\nThus, the numerator becomes 1 + 2 sin42° cos36°. But I don't know if this helps.\n\nSimilarly, the denominator: cos6° + sin12° = cos6° + sin12°. Perhaps express cos6° as sin84°, so sin84° + sin12°.\n\nThen, using sum-to-product again:\n\nsin84° + sin12° = 2 sin( (84° + 12°)/2 ) cos( (84° - 12°)/2 ) = 2 sin48° cos36°\n\nSo denominator is 2 sin48° cos36°, and numerator is 1 + 2 sin42° cos36°\n\nHmm, interesting. So now the fraction is:\n\n[1 + 2 sin42° cos36°] / [2 sin48° cos36°] = [1 + 2 sin42° cos36°] / [2 sin48° cos36°]\n\nCancel cos36° from numerator and denominator:\n\n[1 + 2 sin42° cos36°] / [2 sin48° cos36°] = [1/(2 sin48°)] + [2 sin42° cos36° / (2 sin48° cos36°)] = [1/(2 sin48°)] + [sin42° / sin48°]\n\nBut sin48° = sin(90° - 42°) = cos42°, so sin42° / sin48° = sin42° / cos42° = tan42°. Also, 1/(2 sin48°) = 1/(2 cos42°)\n\nSo the expression becomes:\n\n1/(2 cos42°) + tan42° = [1/(2 cos42°)] + [sin42° / cos42°] = [1 + 2 sin42°]/(2 cos42°)\n\nBut wait, this seems like going in circles. Let me check:\n\nWait, after substituting numerator and denominator as:\n\nNumerator: 1 + 2 sin42° cos36°\n\nDenominator: 2 sin48° cos36°\n\nBut sin48° = sin(60° - 12°) = sin60° cos12° - cos60° sin12°, which might not help. Alternatively, note that 48° = 42° + 6°, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express sin48° in terms of sin42°, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, recall that 42° + 48° = 90°, so sin48° = cos42°. Therefore, denominator becomes 2 cos42° cos36°\n\nNumerator: 1 + 2 sin42° cos36°\n\nSo the fraction is [1 + 2 sin42° cos36°] / [2 cos42° cos36°]\n\nLet me split the fraction:\n\n1/(2 cos42° cos36°) + [2 sin42° cos36°)/(2 cos42° cos36°)] = 1/(2 cos42° cos36°) + sin42°/cos42°\n\nWhich is 1/(2 cos42° cos36°) + tan42°\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is leading anywhere. Let me compute tan42° numerically: tan42° ≈ 0.9004\n\nAnd 1/(2 cos42° cos36°). Compute cos42 ≈ 0.7431, cos36 ≈ 0.8090, so 2*0.7431*0.8090 ≈ 1.200. So 1/1.200 ≈ 0.8333. Then 0.8333 + 0.9004 ≈ 1.7337, which is approximately √3 (1.732), close enough considering rounding. But how to see this analytically?\n\nWait, maybe the sum 1/(2 cos42° cos36°) + tan42° equals √3.\n\nLet me compute:\n\n1/(2 cos42° cos36°) + tan42° = [1 + 2 sin42° cos42°]/(2 cos42° cos36°)\n\nWait, because tan42° = sin42°/cos42°, so:\n\n[1/(2 cos42° cos36°)] + [sin42°/cos42°] = [1 + 2 sin42° cos36°]/(2 cos42° cos36°)\n\nBut I already had this expression. So perhaps there's a way to combine the terms:\n\nLet me write 1 as 2 sin30°, since sin30° = 0.5, so 2 sin30° = 1. Then:\n\nNumerator: 2 sin30° + 2 sin42° cos36° = 2 [sin30° + sin42° cos36°]\n\nDenominator: 2 cos42° cos36°\n\nSo the fraction is [sin30° + sin42° cos36°]/(cos42° cos36°)\n\nHmm, not sure. Alternatively, use product-to-sum on sin42° cos36°:\n\nsin42° cos36° = [sin(42° + 36°) + sin(42° - 36°)]/2 = [sin78° + sin6°]/2\n\nSo numerator becomes sin30° + [sin78° + sin6°]/2 = (2 sin30° + sin78° + sin6°)/2\n\nCompute 2 sin30° = 1, so numerator is (1 + sin78° + sin6°)/2\n\nDenominator: cos42° cos36°\n\nSo the fraction is [1 + sin78° + sin6°]/(2 cos42° cos36°)\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, compute sin78° = cos12°, sin6° is sin6°, so numerator is 1 + cos12° + sin6°, which is the original numerator. So we end up back where we started. This seems like a loop.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider using complementary angles or auxiliary angles. Suppose we set φ such that tanφ = √3, so φ = 60°, then perhaps the numerator is equal to √3 times the denominator, which would imply the ratio is √3.\n\nAlternatively, use the formula for a linear combination of sine and cosine. For example, any expression of the form a sinθ + b cosθ can be written as R sin(θ + φ), where R = √(a² + b²). Maybe apply this to the numerator and denominator.\n\nBut the numerator and denominator are combinations of constants, sines, and cosines. Let's see:\n\nNumerator: 1 + sin6° + cos12°. Let's group sin6° + cos12°, so that's 1 + (sin6° + cos12°). Similarly, denominator is cos6° + sin12°.\n\nAlternatively, write the numerator as 1 + sin6° + cos12° = 1 + sin6° + sin78°, since cos12° = sin78°.\n\nThen, using sum-to-product on sin6° + sin78°:\n\nsin6° + sin78° = 2 sin(42°) cos(36°)\n\nSo numerator becomes 1 + 2 sin42° cos36°. \n\nSimilarly, denominator: cos6° + sin12° = sin84° + sin12° = 2 sin48° cos36°, as we did before.\n\nSo the fraction is [1 + 2 sin42° cos36°] / [2 sin48° cos36°] = [1 + 2 sin42° cos36°] / [2 sin48° cos36°]\n\nCancel cos36°:\n\n[1 + 2 sin42° cos36°] / [2 sin48° cos36°] = [1/(2 sin48°)] + [sin42° / sin48°]\n\nNow, sin48° = sin(90° - 42°) = cos42°, so:\n\n[1/(2 cos42°)] + [sin42° / cos42°] = (1/(2 cos42°)) + tan42°\n\nLet me compute this expression:\n\ntan42° + 1/(2 cos42°)\n\nLet me express tan42° as sin42°/cos42°, so:\n\nsin42°/cos42° + 1/(2 cos42°) = [2 sin42° + 1]/(2 cos42°)\n\nSo the fraction simplifies to [1 + 2 sin42°]/(2 cos42°)\n\nNow, we need to show that [1 + 2 sin42°]/(2 cos42°) = √3.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 cos42°:\n\n1 + 2 sin42° = 2√3 cos42°\n\nLet me verify this numerically:\n\nLeft-hand side (LHS): 1 + 2 sin42° ≈ 1 + 2*0.6691 ≈ 1 + 1.3382 ≈ 2.3382\n\nRight-hand side (RHS): 2√3 cos42° ≈ 2*1.732*0.7431 ≈ 3.464*0.7431 ≈ 2.575\n\nWait, this doesn't match. There's a discrepancy here, which suggests an error in the previous steps. Wait, no, earlier when I computed the fraction [1 + 2 sin42°]/(2 cos42°), I thought it should equal √3, but numerically it's about 2.3382/(2*0.7431) ≈ 2.3382/1.4862 ≈ 1.573, which is not √3 (≈1.732). So there must be a mistake in the reasoning.\n\nWait, this suggests that somewhere in the transformations, there's an error. Let's retrace the steps.\n\nOriginal fraction after substitution became [1 + 2 sin42° cos36°]/[2 sin48° cos36°]. Then, cancelling cos36°, we get [1 + 2 sin42° cos36°]/(2 sin48°). Then, we split into [1/(2 sin48°)] + [sin42° cos36°/sin48°]\n\nBut sin48° = sin(42° + 6°) = sin42° cos6° + cos42° sin6°\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in splitting the fraction. Let's re-express:\n\n[1 + 2 sin42° cos36°]/[2 sin48° cos36°] = [1/(2 sin48° cos36°)] + [sin42° / sin48°]\n\nBut this step is incorrect. The correct splitting would be:\n\n[1 + 2 sin42° cos36°]/(2 sin48° cos36°) = [1/(2 sin48° cos36°)] + [2 sin42° cos36°/(2 sin48° cos36°)] = [1/(2 sin48° cos36°)] + [sin42°/sin48°]\n\nYes, that's correct. But sin48° = sin(90° - 42°) = cos42°, so we have:\n\n[1/(2 cos42° cos36°)] + [sin42°/cos42°]\n\nBut combining these terms requires a common denominator. Let me compute:\n\n[1 + 2 sin42° cos36°]/[2 cos42° cos36°]\n\nWait, no. Let me write the entire expression again:\n\n[1 + 2 sin42° cos36°]/[2 sin48° cos36°] = [1 + 2 sin42° cos36°]/[2 cos42° cos36°] (since sin48° = cos42°)\n\nThen, this is equal to [1/(2 cos42° cos36°)] + [2 sin42° cos36°/(2 cos42° cos36°)] = [1/(2 cos42° cos36°)] + [sin42°/cos42°]\n\nNow, combining the terms over a common denominator:\n\n= [1 + 2 sin42° cos36° * cos42° cos36° ] / (2 cos42° cos36°)\n\nWait, no, that's not right. The two terms are:\n\nTerm1: 1/(2 cos42° cos36°)\n\nTerm2: sin42°/cos42°\n\nTo combine them, we need to express Term2 with denominator 2 cos42° cos36°:\n\nTerm2: [sin42° * 2 cos36°]/(2 cos42° cos36°)\n\nSo total expression:\n\n[1 + 2 sin42° cos36°]/(2 cos42° cos36°)\n\nWhich brings us back to where we started. This circular reasoning suggests that this approach isn't working.\n\nLet me try a different angle. Perhaps use known values or identities related to 30°, 45°, 60° angles. For example, 42° is 60° - 18°, and 36° is related to the pentagon. Maybe use exact values for sin42° and cos36°, but I recall that cos36° is (1 + √5)/4 * 2, which is (sqrt(5)+1)/4 * 2 = (sqrt(5)+1)/2 * 1/2? Wait, cos36° is (1 + √5)/4 * 2, which equals (sqrt(5)+1)/4 * 2 = (sqrt(5)+1)/2. Wait, no, exact value of cos36° is (1 + √5)/4 * 2. Let me check:\n\ncos36° = (sqrt(5)+1)/4 * 2 = (sqrt(5)+1)/2 * 1/2? Wait, actually, cos36° is (1 + √5)/4 * 2, but I need to verify.\n\nThe exact value of cos36° is (1 + √5)/4 * 2, which is (1 + √5)/2 * 0.5. Wait, no. Let me recall that cos36° = (1 + √5)/4 * 2. Actually, cos36° is equal to (1 + √5)/4 multiplied by 2, which is (1 + √5)/2 * 0.5. Wait, no. Let me recall that cos36° = (sqrt(5)+1)/4 * 2. Actually, the exact value is cos36° = (1 + √5)/4 * 2π? No, that's not right.\n\nWait, let me recall that cos36° = (1 + √5)/4 * 2. Actually, in exact terms, cos36° = (sqrt(5)+1)/4 * 2. Let me double-check:\n\nIn a regular pentagon, the cosine of 36° is related to the golden ratio φ = (1 + √5)/2. Specifically, cos36° = φ/2 = (1 + √5)/4 * 2. Wait, no. Let's compute it correctly.\n\nWe know that cos36° = (1 + √5)/4 * 2. Wait, let's compute it using exact formulas:\n\ncos36° = (1 + √5)/4 * 2. Let me compute:\n\nFrom the pentagon, we know that cos36° = (1 + √5)/4 * 2. Alternatively, using the formula for cosine of 36°, derived from the pentagon, it's known that cos36° = (1 + √5)/4 * 2. Wait, actually, exact value is:\n\ncos36° = (1 + √5)/4 * 2, which simplifies to (1 + √5)/2 * 0.5. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me look it up mentally:\n\nYes, the exact value of cos36° is (1 + √5)/4 * 2, which is equal to (1 + √5)/2 * 0.5. No, that's not correct. Wait, let's derive it.\n\nIn a regular pentagon, the diagonal over side is the golden ratio φ = (1 + √5)/2 ≈ 1.618. Using the law of cosines on a triangle in the pentagon, we can find cos36°.\n\nAlternatively, using the double-angle formula:\n\ncos2θ = 2cos²θ - 1\n\nLet θ = 36°, then cos72° = 2cos²36° - 1\n\nBut cos72° = sin18°, and sin18° = (√5 - 1)/4 * 2. Wait, sin18° = (√5 - 1)/4 * 2. But let's solve for cos36°.\n\nLet me let x = cos36°, then:\n\ncos72° = 2x² - 1\n\nBut cos72° = sin18° = (√5 - 1)/4 * 2. Wait, sin18° = (√5 - 1)/4 ≈ 0.3090, which is approximately correct.\n\nSo, (√5 - 1)/4 = 2x² - 1\n\nSolving for x:\n\n2x² = (√5 - 1)/4 + 1 = (√5 - 1 + 4)/4 = (√5 + 3)/4\n\nThus, x² = (√5 + 3)/8\n\nTherefore, x = sqrt[(√5 + 3)/8] = sqrt(2(√5 + 3))/4. This can be simplified further:\n\nsqrt(2(√5 + 3)) = sqrt(6 + 2√5). Notice that (√5 + 1)² = 5 + 2√5 + 1 = 6 + 2√5. So sqrt(6 + 2√5) = √5 + 1.\n\nTherefore, x = (√5 + 1)/4 * sqrt(4) = (√5 + 1)/4 * 2 = (√5 + 1)/2. Wait, that can't be because sqrt(6 + 2√5) = √5 + 1. So:\n\nx = sqrt(6 + 2√5)/4 = (√5 + 1)/4 * 2 = (√5 + 1)/2 * 0.5. Wait, no:\n\nWait, sqrt(6 + 2√5) = √5 + 1, because (√5 + 1)^2 = 5 + 2√5 + 1 = 6 + 2√5. Therefore, sqrt(6 + 2√5) = √5 + 1. Therefore:\n\nx = sqrt(6 + 2√5)/4 = (√5 + 1)/4 * 2 = (√5 + 1)/2 * 1/2. Wait, no. If sqrt(6 + 2√5) = √5 + 1, then:\n\nx = (√5 + 1)/4 * 2. Wait, no:\n\nWait, x = sqrt[(√5 + 3)/8] = sqrt( ( (√5 + 1) + 2 ) /8 ). This seems messy. Alternatively, accept that cos36° = (1 + √5)/4 * 2. But actually, from the previous steps:\n\nx = cos36° = (√5 + 1)/4 * 2, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, we had:\n\nx² = (√5 + 3)/8\n\nThus, x = sqrt( (√5 + 3)/8 )\n\nBut this doesn't simplify neatly. So perhaps this approach isn't helpful.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the steps I've tried without success, maybe I should look for another method. Let's consider using the formula for tangent of a sum or difference.\n\nSuppose I consider the fraction:\n\n(1 + sin6° + cos12°)/(cos6° + sin12°)\n\nLet me try to write this as [1 + sin6° + cos12°] = √3 (cos6° + sin12°)\n\nIf I can express the left side as √3 times the right side, then the identity holds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that both sides are equal to tan60°, and use tan(A + B) formula.\n\nAlternatively, consider expressing the numerator and denominator in terms of angles that differ by 60°, but not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Use the sine and cosine of 30° - 24°, but 24° is 6°*4, which might not help.\n\nAlternatively, let me use the following identity:\n\nsinA + cosB = sqrt(2) sin(A + 45° - B/2) cos(B/2 - 45° + A/2). But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, use the identity for sum of sines and cosines:\n\n1 + sin6° + cos12° = 1 + sin6° + cos12°\n\nLet me try to express this as a sum of two terms: 1 + (sin6° + cos12°)\n\nAs before, sin6° + cos12° = sin6° + sin78°, which is 2 sin42° cos36°. So numerator is 1 + 2 sin42° cos36°, denominator is 2 sin48° cos36°.\n\nSo the ratio is [1 + 2 sin42° cos36°]/[2 sin48° cos36°] = [1 + sin84° + sin(-6°)]/[2 sin48° cos36°]\n\nWait, using identity: sinA cosB = [sin(A+B) + sin(A-B)]/2. So 2 sin42° cos36° = sin78° + sin6°, so:\n\nNumerator: 1 + sin78° + sin6° = 1 + sin78° + sin6°. But sin78° = cos12°, so we're back to the original numerator.\n\nThis is going in circles. Maybe time to try another approach. Let me consider writing everything in terms of sine and cosine of 6° and use substitution.\n\nLet me set x = 6°, so θ = x, and the expression becomes:\n\n(1 + sinx + cos2x)/(cosx + sin2x) = √3\n\nWe can substitute cos2x = 1 - 2 sin²x and sin2x = 2 sinx cosx:\n\nNumerator: 1 + sinx + (1 - 2 sin²x) = 2 + sinx - 2 sin²x\n\nDenominator: cosx + 2 sinx cosx = cosx (1 + 2 sinx)\n\nSo the equation is (2 + sinx - 2 sin²x)/(cosx (1 + 2 sinx)) = √3\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n2 + sinx - 2 sin²x = √3 cosx (1 + 2 sinx)\n\nNow, square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\n[2 + sinx - 2 sin²x]^2 = 3 cos²x (1 + 2 sinx)^2\n\nExpand the left side:\n\n(2 + sinx - 2 sin²x)^2 = [2 + sinx - 2 sin²x]^2\n\nLet me compute this term by term:\n\n= (2)^2 + (sinx)^2 + (-2 sin²x)^2 + 2*(2)(sinx) + 2*(2)(-2 sin²x) + 2*(sinx)(-2 sin²x)\n\n= 4 + sin²x + 4 sin⁴x + 4 sinx - 8 sin²x - 4 sin³x\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n4 + (sin²x - 8 sin²x) + 4 sin⁴x + 4 sinx - 4 sin³x\n\n= 4 - 7 sin²x + 4 sin⁴x + 4 sinx - 4 sin³x\n\nNow, the right side:\n\n3 cos²x (1 + 2 sinx)^2 = 3 (1 - sin²x) (1 + 4 sinx + 4 sin²x)\n\nExpand the terms inside:\n\n= 3 (1 - sin²x)(1 + 4 sinx + 4 sin²x)\n\nMultiply out the brackets:\n\nFirst compute (1)(1 + 4 sinx + 4 sin²x) = 1 + 4 sinx + 4 sin²x\n\nThen (-sin²x)(1 + 4 sinx + 4 sin²x) = -sin²x - 4 sin³x -4 sin⁴x\n\nCombine them:\n\n1 + 4 sinx + 4 sin²x - sin²x -4 sin³x -4 sin⁴x = 1 + 4 sinx + 3 sin²x -4 sin³x -4 sin⁴x\n\nMultiply by 3:\n\n3 + 12 sinx + 9 sin²x -12 sin³x -12 sin⁴x\n\nNow, set left side equal to right side:\n\n4 -7 sin²x +4 sin⁴x +4 sinx -4 sin³x = 3 +12 sinx +9 sin²x -12 sin³x -12 sin⁴x\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n4 -7 sin²x +4 sin⁴x +4 sinx -4 sin³x -3 -12 sinx -9 sin²x +12 sin³x +12 sin⁴x = 0\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nConstants: 4 -3 = 1\n\nsinx: 4 sinx -12 sinx = -8 sinx\n\nsin²x: -7 sin²x -9 sin²x = -16 sin²x\n\nsin³x: -4 sin³x +12 sin³x = 8 sin³x\n\nsin⁴x: 4 sin⁴x +12 sin⁴x = 16 sin⁴x\n\nSo left side becomes:\n\n1 -8 sinx -16 sin²x +8 sin³x +16 sin⁴x = 0\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n16 sin⁴x +8 sin³x -16 sin²x -8 sinx +1 =0\n\nThis is a quartic equation in sinx. Let me denote y = sinx. Then the equation becomes:\n\n16 y⁴ +8 y³ -16 y² -8 y +1 =0\n\nThis seems daunting, but maybe it factors.\n\nLet me try to factor this quartic equation. Maybe group terms:\n\n(16 y⁴ +8 y³) + (-16 y² -8 y) +1 =0\n\nFactor:\n\n8 y³(2 y +1) -8 y(2 y +1) +1 =0\n\nNotice that 8 y³(2 y +1) -8 y(2 y +1) = (2 y +1)(8 y³ -8 y) = (2 y +1) 8 y(y² -1) = (2 y +1) 8 y(y -1)(y +1)\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n(2 y +1) 8 y(y -1)(y +1) +1 =0\n\nBut this doesn't seem to help. Alternatively, look for rational roots using Rational Root Theorem. Possible rational roots are ±1, ±1/2, ±1/4, ±1/8, ±1/16.\n\nTest y = 1/2:\n\n16*(1/2)^4 +8*(1/2)^3 -16*(1/2)^2 -8*(1/2) +1 =16*(1/16) +8*(1/8) -16*(1/4) -8*(1/2) +1 =1 +1 -4 -4 +1 = -5 ≠0\n\nTest y = -1/2:\n\n16*(1/16) +8*(-1/8) -16*(1/4) -8*(-1/2) +1 =1 -1 -4 +4 +1 =1 ≠0\n\nTest y =1:\n\n16 +8 -16 -8 +1=1 ≠0\n\nTest y= -1:\n\n16 -8 -16 +8 +1=1 ≠0\n\nTest y=1/4:\n\n16*(1/256) +8*(1/64) -16*(1/16) -8*(1/4) +1 = (0.0625) + (0.125) -1 -2 +1 = -1.8125 ≠0\n\nSimilarly, y=1/8: likely won't work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this quartic factors into quadratics. Suppose:\n\n(ay² + by +c)(dy² + ey +f) =0\n\nMultiplying out:\n\nad y⁴ + (ae + bd) y³ + (af + be + cd) y² + (bf + ce) y + cf =0\n\nComparing coefficients:\n\nad =16\n\nae + bd =8\n\naf + be + cd = -16\n\nbf + ce = -8\n\ncf =1\n\nAssuming a and d are factors of 16. Let's try a=4, d=4:\n\nThen ad=16.\n\nNow:\n\nae + bd =4e +4b =8 => e + b =2\n\naf + be + cd =4f + b e +4c =-16\n\nbf + ce =b f +c e =-8\n\ncf=1, so c and f are 1 and 1 or -1 and -1. Let's try c=1, f=1:\n\nThen cf=1. So:\n\nbf + ce =b*1 +1*e =b + e =-8\n\nBut from earlier, e + b =2. This is inconsistent, since b + e =-8 and e + b=2.\n\nContradiction. Try c=-1, f=-1:\n\ncf=1. Then:\n\nbf + ce =b*(-1) + (-1)*e = -b -e =-8 => b + e=8\n\nFrom earlier, e + b =2. Again contradiction.\n\nTry a=8, d=2:\n\nad=16.\n\nThen ae + bd=8e +2b=8 =>8e +2b=8 =>4e +b=4\n\naf + be + cd=8f +b e +2c=-16\n\nbf + ce =b f +c e=-8\n\ncf=1\n\nAssuming c=1, f=1:\n\nbf + ce =b*1 +1*e =b +e =-8\n\nFrom 4e +b=4 and b +e=-8:\n\nFrom the second equation: b = -8 -e\n\nSubstitute into first:4e + (-8 -e)=4 =>3e -8=4 =>3e=12 =>e=4\n\nThen b= -8 -4= -12\n\nCheck af + be + cd=8*1 + (-12)*4 +2*1=8 -48 +2=-38 ≠-16. Not good.\n\nTry c=-1, f=-1:\n\ncf=1.\n\nbf + ce =b*(-1) + (-1)*e = -b -e =-8 =>b +e=8\n\nFrom 4e +b=4 and b=8 -e:\n\n4e +8 -e=4 =>3e= -4 =>e= -4/3\n\nNot integer, likely not helpful.\n\nTry a=2, d=8:\n\nad=16.\n\nae + bd=2e +8b=8\n\naf + be + cd=2f +b e +8c=-16\n\nbf + ce= b f +c e=-8\n\ncf=1\n\nAgain, trying c=1, f=1:\n\nbf + ce =b + e=-8\n\nFrom ae + bd=2e +8b=8:\n\nLet’s solve:\n\nFrom b + e=-8 => e = -8 -b\n\nSubstitute into 2e +8b=8:\n\n2*(-8 -b) +8b=8 =>-16 -2b +8b=8 =>6b=24 =>b=4\n\nThen e= -8 -4= -12\n\nCheck af + be + cd=2*1 +4*(-12) +8*1=2 -48 +8= -38 ≠-16. No.\n\nSimilarly, other combinations might not work.\n\nThis approach is not fruitful. Perhaps the quartic factors into two quadratics with real coefficients but not rational. Alternatively, recognize that since we know x=6° satisfies the equation, then y=sin6° is a root. Let's check:\n\nWe have y=sin6° ≈0.104528\n\nPlug into the quartic:\n\n16y⁴ +8y³ -16y² -8y +1 ≈16*(0.00012) +8*(0.00114) -16*(0.0109) -8*(0.1045) +1 ≈0.00192 +0.00912 -0.1744 -0.836 +1 ≈ (0.00192+0.00912) - (0.1744+0.836) +1 ≈0.01104 -1.0104 +1 ≈-0.0104 +1 ≈0.9896 ≈1. Not zero. Hmm, but this is approximate. Due to rounding errors, perhaps it's actually zero.\n\nBut this suggests that the quartic equation is not satisfied by y=sin6°, which contradicts our original assumption. Therefore, there must be an error in the algebra when squaring both sides. Because when we square both sides of an equation, we can introduce extraneous solutions, but in this case, we are trying to verify an identity, which should hold true. But the numerical substitution after squaring doesn't align, indicating a mistake in the process.\n\nThis suggests that squaring both sides might not be the right approach, or perhaps there's a calculation error in expanding the terms. Given the complexity of this quartic equation and the time I've already invested without progress, I need to find a different method.\n\nLet me go back to the original expression:\n\n(1 + sin6° + cos12°)/(cos6° + sin12°) = √3\n\nLet me consider using the tangent addition formula. Let me denote the numerator as N and the denominator as D. If N/D = √3, then N = √3 D. So:\n\n1 + sin6° + cos12° = √3 (cos6° + sin12°)\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\n1 = √3 (cos6° + sin12°) - sin6° - cos12°\n\nLet me compute the right-hand side:\n\n√3 cos6° + √3 sin12° - sin6° - cos12°\n\nGroup terms:\n\n(√3 cos6° - cos12°) + (√3 sin12° - sin6°)\n\nLet me factor out cos6° from the first group and sin6° from the second group:\n\ncos6° (√3 - cos12°/cos6°) + sin6° (√3 sin12°/sin6° - 1)\n\nBut this doesn't seem helpful. Alternatively, express cos12° and sin12° in terms of cos6° and sin6°:\n\ncos12° = 2 cos²6° - 1\n\nsin12° = 2 sin6° cos6°\n\nSubstituting back:\n\n1 = √3 (cos6° + 2 sin6° cos6°) - sin6° - (2 cos²6° -1 )\n\nSimplify:\n\n1 = √3 cos6° (1 + 2 sin6°) - sin6° - 2 cos²6° +1\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\n0 = √3 cos6° (1 + 2 sin6°) - sin6° - 2 cos²6°\n\nThis brings us back to the equation we had earlier. It seems like we're stuck in a loop.\n\nPerhaps another approach: Use substitution t = tan6°, then express everything in terms of t.\n\nLet t = tan6°, so sin6° = t / √(1 + t²), cos6° = 1 / √(1 + t²)\n\nThen, cos12° = 2 cos²6° -1 = 2/(1 + t²) -1 = (2 -1 - t²)/(1 + t²) = (1 - t²)/(1 + t²)\n\nSin12° = 2 sin6° cos6° = 2t/(1 + t²)\n\nNow, substitute into the original expression:\n\nNumerator: 1 + t/√(1 + t²) + (1 - t²)/(1 + t²)\n\nDenominator: 1/√(1 + t²) + 2t/(1 + t²)\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (1 + t²)√(1 + t²) to eliminate denominators:\n\nNumerator becomes: (1 + t²)√(1 + t²) + t(1 + t²) + (1 - t²)√(1 + t²)\n\nDenominator becomes: (1 + t²) + 2t√(1 + t²)\n\nThis seems complicated, but let's try to simplify:\n\nNumerator:\n\n= (1 + t²)√(1 + t²) + t(1 + t²) + (1 - t²)√(1 + t²)\n\n= [(1 + t²) + (1 - t²)]√(1 + t²) + t(1 + t²)\n\n= 2√(1 + t²) + t(1 + t²)\n\nDenominator:\n\n= (1 + t²) + 2t√(1 + t²)\n\nSo the frac",
