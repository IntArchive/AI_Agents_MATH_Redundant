    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants to show two inequalities related to vector norms: first, that the L2 norm is less than or equal to the L1 norm, and second, that the L2 norm is less than or equal to the square root of m times the infinity norm. \n\nStarting with the first part: proving ||x||_2 ≤ ||x||_1. The user provided an inequality involving square roots and sums. Let me check if that's correct. The L2 norm is the square root of the sum of squares, and the L1 norm is the sum of absolute values. The user wrote sqrt( sum x_i^2 ) ≤ sum ( sqrt(x_i)^2 ). Wait, sqrt(x_i)^2 is just |x_i|, right? Because sqrt(x_i^2) is |x_i|. So the right-hand side becomes sum |x_i|, which is the L1 norm. So their inequality is actually sqrt( sum x_i^2 ) ≤ sum |x_i|, which is the same as ||x||_2 ≤ ||x||_1. But wait, that's the opposite of what's usually true. Wait, no. Wait, the standard inequality is that the L1 norm is greater than or equal to the L2 norm. For example, in 2D, for a vector (a, b), L1 is |a| + |b|, and L2 is sqrt(a² + b²). Since (|a| + |b|)² = a² + 2|ab| + b² ≥ a² + b², so taking square roots, |a| + |b| ≥ sqrt(a² + b²). So indeed, ||x||_1 ≥ ||x||_2. Therefore, the user's first inequality is correct, but the problem statement in the title says \"showing that l2 norm is smaller than l1\", which matches ||x||_2 ≤ ||x||_1. So the user is correct here.\n\nNow, the second part: ||x||_2 ≤ sqrt(m) ||x||_∞. Let's see. The infinity norm is the maximum absolute value of the components. Suppose x has m components. Then each |x_i| ≤ ||x||_∞. So the sum of squares is m*(||x||_∞)^2, so the L2 norm is sqrt(m) * ||x||_∞. Therefore, ||x||_2 ≤ sqrt(m) ||x||_∞. That makes sense.\n\nBut looking at the original question, the user wrote \"regarding the first part, can I say that: sqrt(sum x_i^2 ) ≤ sum sqrt(x_i)^2\". Wait, but sqrt(x_i)^2 is |x_i|, so sum sqrt(x_i)^2 is sum |x_i|. So that inequality is exactly the same as ||x||_2 ≤ ||x||_1. Therefore, the user is suggesting using this inequality to prove the first part, but is that valid? Wait, actually, the inequality sqrt(sum x_i²) ≤ sum |x_i| is equivalent to ||x||_2 ≤ ||x||_1. But how do you prove that? The standard approach is to square both sides. Squaring the left gives sum x_i², squaring the right gives (sum |x_i|)^2 = sum |x_i|² + 2 sum_{i<j} |x_i||x_j|. Since the cross terms are non-negative, the right-hand side is larger, so sum x_i² ≤ (sum |x_i|)^2. Taking square roots (since both sides are non-negative), we get sqrt(sum x_i²) ≤ sum |x_i|. Therefore, this approach works. So the user's proposed inequality is correct for the first part.\n\nHowever, in the original problem statement, there might be some confusion in how the user phrased the question. The title says \"showing that l2 norm is smaller than l1\", which is ||x||_2 ≤ ||x||_1. Then the problem statement in the question starts with \"How can I show that L_2 ≤ L_1 ||x||_1 ≥ ||x||_2...\", which seems a bit jumbled. But the core is to show the two inequalities. \n\nNow, structuring this according to the required format. The assumptions would list any conditions on the vector x. For the first inequality, ||x||_2 ≤ ||x||_1, the vector x must be a real vector (since norms are defined for real or complex vectors, but here the user is using square roots and sums without specifying complex, so likely real). Also, the problem applies to vectors in R^m. Similarly, for the second inequality, the same assumptions hold. The problem then is to show both inequalities.\n\nWait, but looking at the example given in the original query, the user structured the problem by listing assumptions line by line, each addressing one property. So in the example, assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in the current problem, the assumptions are about the vector x. However, the user's original question didn't specify any particular conditions on x except that it's in R^m (since they mention m in the second inequality). Therefore, the assumptions would be that x is a real vector with m components. However, the user's question as written in Math Stack Exchange might not have stated m explicitly, but since the second inequality involves sqrt(m), m must be the dimension of the vector. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption: x is a real vector with m components.\n\nBut wait, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption: x is a vector in R^m.\n\nBut maybe the user hasn't specified, so perhaps the problem is general. Alternatively, maybe there are no specific assumptions beyond x being a vector in R^m. However, in the example provided, the user had to list assumptions even if they were part of the problem statement. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem listed assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\". That suggests that perhaps the example was incorrect, or maybe the original problem had a typo. But perhaps in the example, the user made a mistake. Anyway, the key is to extract the assumptions from the problem as stated.\n\nIn the current problem, the user wants to show two inequalities: ||x||_1 ≥ ||x||_2 and ||x||_2 ≤ sqrt(m) ||x||_∞. The standard conditions for these inequalities are that x is a vector in R^m (or C^m, but since the norms are defined similarly). Therefore, the assumptions would be that x is a real vector, and perhaps the number of components is m. However, in the problem statement, the user didn't specify that m is the dimension, but in the second inequality, sqrt(m) is used, so m must be the number of components. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption: x is a real vector with m components.\n\nBut according to the format, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption: x is a real vector,\nAssumption: x has m components.\n\nBut the original problem doesn't state these explicitly; they are inferred. However, since the problem is about vector norms, these are inherent assumptions. Therefore, in the formatted problem, we need to list these as assumptions.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption: x is a real vector,\nAssumption: x has m components.\n\nProblem: Show that ||x||_1 ≥ ||x||_2 and ||x||_2 ≤ √m ||x||_∞.\n\nBut wait, the original question's title is \"Showing that l_2 norm is smaller than l_1\", so the first inequality. The user then mentions both parts. The problem as stated in the question is: \"How can I show that L_2 ≤ L_1 $||x||_1 ≥ ||x||_2$ and also we have that ||x||_2 ≤ √m ||x||_∞\". So the problem is to show both inequalities. Therefore, the problem part should include both. \n\nBut perhaps the user intended two separate inequalities. So the formatted problem should list both. However, the example given by the user had a problem statement that was a single sentence. Therefore, the problem here would be to show both inequalities. \n\nSo final formatted version would be:\n\nAssumption: x is a real vector,\nAssumption: x has m components.\n\nProblem: Show that ||x||₁ ≥ ||x||₂ and ||x||₂ ≤ √m ||x||_∞.\n\nBut let me check the original question again. The user wrote: \"How can I show that L_2 ≤ L_1 $||x||_1\\ge ||x||_2$ and also we have that $\\|x\\|_2\\leq \\sqrt m\\|x\\|_{\\infty}$\". So the first part is to show L₂ ≤ L₁, which is equivalent to ||x||₁ ≥ ||x||₂, and then the second inequality. Therefore, the problem is to show both. So the formatted problem should include both parts. Therefore, the assumptions are that x is a real vector with m components. \n\nBut wait, does the first inequality (between L1 and L2) depend on the dimension m? No, the inequality ||x||_1 ≥ ||x||_2 holds for any real vector regardless of the dimension. The second inequality does involve m, which is the number of components. Therefore, the assumption about m is needed for the second part. But in the first part, m isn't involved. However, since the problem includes both parts, we need to list that x has m components as an assumption for the second part. So perhaps the assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption: x is a real vector,\nAssumption: x has m components.\n\nBut in the first part, the inequality ||x||₁ ≥ ||x||₂ holds for any real vector, regardless of the number of components. However, the problem as a whole includes both inequalities, so the second part requires m. Therefore, the assumptions must include that x is a vector with m components. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: x is a real vector,\nAssumption: x has m components.\n\nProblem: Show that ||x||₁ ≥ ||x||₂ and ||x||₂ ≤ √m ||x||_∞.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user didn't mention m in the first part, but since the problem includes both, m is part of the assumptions. \n\nNow, checking the example provided by the user, in the original problem, the user had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem included \"n is divisible by 7\". However, that seems like a mistake because the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7. Wait, perhaps the example was incorrect. Wait, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that contradicts because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which includes all integers, not just those divisible by 7. Therefore, perhaps the example is incorrect. But regardless, in our current problem, we need to list the assumptions correctly.\n\nIn our case, the problem as stated in the user's question is to show two inequalities: L2 ≤ L1 and L2 ≤ sqrt(m) L∞. For the first inequality, the only assumption is that x is a real vector. For the second, additionally, that x has m components. Therefore, to cover both parts, the assumptions should include both that x is a real vector and that it has m components. Therefore, the formatted assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption: x is a real vector,\nAssumption: x has m components.\n\nProblem: Show that ||x||₁ ≥ ||x||₂ and ||x||₂ ≤ √m ||x||_∞.\n\nYes, that seems correct. The user's original question didn't specify m, but since the second inequality involves m, it's necessary to include it as an assumption. Therefore, this should be the formatted problem.",
