    "Content": "Q: Show that $\\mathbb {RP}^n$ is not orientable for $n$ even. First I looked at the definition for orientability for manifolds of higher degree than 2, because for surfaces I know the definition with the Möbius strip. A n-dimensional manifold is non-orientable if it contains a homeomorphic image of the space formed by taking the direct product of a (n-1)-dimensional ball B and the unit interval [0,1] and gluing the ball B×{0} at one end to the ball B×{1} at other end with a single reflection. The projective space can be seen as $\\mathbb S^n/\\mathbb Z_2$ or $\\mathbb D^n$ with antipodal points identified on the boundary. I have looked at other similar questions like Why isn't $\\mathbb{RP}^2$ orientable? In that thread someone states that the antipodal map is orientation preserving if $n$ is odd and reversing when $n$ is even. Why is this? Intuitively the antipodal map can be constructed by combining $n+1$ reflections in the hyperspaces $x_i=0$ and if $n$ is odd $n+1$ is even and combining an even amount of reflections is orientation preserving and the other way around for $n$ even and $n+1$ odd. I need a hint for a rigorous proof. Also after I establish this for myself, I need to show that in  $\\mathbb D^n$  with n even and with antipodal points identified on the boundary the higher dimensional analogue of Möbius strip, which has just one reflection, can be embedded. The subset to which it would be homeomorphic is obvious, but I would like a hint in showing that the the different reflections yield the same space.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "According to Poincare Duality, a compact $n$ -manifold $M$ is orientable iff $H_n(M,\\mathbb{Z}) \\neq 0$ .  The homology groups of real projective space can be computed using a cell decomposition with only one cell in each dimension. This wikipedia article has a nice explanation of why this leads to a vanishing top dimensional homology group for $\\mathbb{R} \\mathbb{P}^n$ iff $n$ is even.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to break down the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question. The user wants to show that the real projective space RP^n is not orientable when n is even. They mentioned a few approaches, like using the antipodal map and its effect on orientation, and also constructing something analogous to the Möbius strip in higher dimensions.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the key assumptions and the exact problem statement. The original question starts by asking to prove RP^n is not orientable for even n. The user references definitions involving a specific quotient construction (S^n/Z_2 or D^n with antipodal boundary points identified). They also bring up the antipodal map's orientation properties depending on n's parity.\n\nSo, the main assumptions here would be:\n1. The manifold in question is RP^n, which is defined as S^n modulo the Z_2 action (antipodal identification).\n2. The focus is on even n. The problem is specifically about showing non-orientability in that case.\n3. The antipodal map's orientation behavior: orientation-preserving if n is odd, reversing if n is even. This seems crucial because orientability relates to whether certain maps preserve orientation.\n4. The user also mentions embedding a higher-dimensional Möbius strip in RP^n when n is even, which might be part of the approach but perhaps is a separate part of the problem. Wait, the original problem is just to show RP^n is not orientable for even n, but the user also asks for a hint on embedding the Möbius strip analogue. However, the example given in the initial instruction only includes the main problem, so maybe that part is an additional request. The user might have two parts: proving non-orientability via antipodal map and then showing the Möbius strip embedding. But the main problem stated first is about non-orientability, so perhaps the assumptions should focus on that.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the Assumption section lists each condition applied to one object. So for this problem:\n\nAssumptions should include:\n- The manifold is RP^n (real projective space of dimension n).\n- The space RP^n is constructed as S^n with antipodal points identified (so quotient by Z_2 action).\n- The problem is for n even.\n- The antipodal map on S^n is orientation-reversing when n is even (this is a key point the user mentions, though they are asking why it's true. However, the problem's proof might rely on this fact, so maybe this is an assumption or needs to be proven. But the user is asking for a proof, so perhaps the assumption is that n is even, and the antipodal map's orientation behavior is a step in the proof. However, the example given in the format seems to take conditions given in the problem. Since the problem states to show RP^n is not orientable for even n, perhaps the only assumptions are the definition of RP^n and n being even. The antipodal map's orientation properties might be part of the solution, not the assumptions. So maybe the problem is presented with the assumption that n is even and RP^n is defined as the quotient of S^n under antipodal identification. Then the problem is to prove non-orientability. The user is also seeking a hint on why the antipodal map is orientation reversing when n is even, which might be a lemma needed for the proof. However, in the problem statement, should that be part of the problem or the assumptions? The original problem says \"Show that RP^n is not orientable for n even.\" So perhaps the assumptions are simply:\n\n- M = RP^n is the real projective space of dimension n.\n- n is an even integer.\n- RP^n is constructed as S^n / ~ where ~ is the antipodal equivalence relation (x ~ -x).\n\nBut the user also mentions the definition of orientability in terms of containing an embedded \"thickened\" Möbius strip, which is another approach. However, the problem as stated in the title and first sentence is to show non-orientability for even n. So the main problem is that. The rest of the user's text is their thought process and other related questions.\n\nTherefore, structuring the problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The manifold is the real projective space $\\mathbb{RP}^n$.\n- $n$ is an even integer.\n- $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ is constructed as the quotient space $\\mathbb{S}^n / \\sim$ where $\\sim$ identifies antipodal points.\n\nProblem: Show that $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ is not orientable.\n\nBut wait, in the example provided, the assumptions included specific conditions on the object. Here, the key is that n is even. The problem is to show non-orientability given n even and the construction via antipodal quotient. So perhaps:\n\nAssumptions:\n- $n$ is an even integer.\n- $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ is defined as the quotient manifold $\\mathbb{S}^n / \\mathbb{Z}_2$ under the antipodal action.\n\nProblem: Prove that $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ is not orientable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the definition of orientability using the antipodal map's orientation properties is part of the problem's assumptions? But the user is asking to prove that, so perhaps not. The user mentions that someone stated the antipodal map is orientation preserving if n is odd and reversing if even, and they want to know why. So maybe the problem is to show non-orientability using the fact that the antipodal map reverses orientation when n is even. But in that case, the problem would have the assumption that the antipodal map is orientation-reversing for even n. However, the user is seeking a proof of that statement as well. Therefore, perhaps the problem as posed is to show non-orientability under the assumption that n is even and using the given definitions, but the antipodal map's orientation behavior is part of what needs to be proven. But since the user is asking for a hint on that part, maybe the problem includes that as a step. However, in the example, the assumption was that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the original problem. So perhaps in this case, the problem is to show RP^n is not orientable for n even, and the assumptions are just n is even and the definition of RP^n as S^n / antipodal. The antipodal map's orientation behavior is part of the solution. Therefore, the formatted problem should list the assumptions given in the problem, not the steps needed to solve it. Hence:\n\nAssumption:\n- $n$ is an even integer.\n- $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ is the quotient manifold $\\mathbb{S}^n / \\mathbb{Z}_2$ with antipodal points identified.\n\nProblem: Show that $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ is not orientable.\n\nAdditionally, the user mentions wanting to embed a higher-dimensional Möbius strip, but that seems like a separate part of their question, so maybe it's another problem. But the main problem they state is the orientability. So focusing on that part. The example given in the initial prompt included assumptions that were part of the problem's given conditions. So in the original problem here, the key given conditions are that n is even and RP^n is defined as S^n modulo antipodal points. So those are the assumptions. The problem is to prove non-orientability. The antipodal map's orientation behavior is a lemma needed for the proof, but not an assumption of the problem. Therefore, the formatted problem should have the assumptions as the given conditions (n even, RP^n as S^n / antipodal) and the problem statement to show non-orientability.",
