    "Content": "An arithmetic sequence of step $d$ is a set of the form:\n{$a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, ...$} where $a, d$ are positive integers. Show that the positive integers cannot be partitioned into a finite number of arithmetic sequences s.t. each sequence has a distinct step $d$. (Except the trivial sequence $a=1, d=1$.) Now the book gives me a hint: Write $\\sum_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}z^n$ as a sum of terms of the type $\\frac{z^a}{1-z^d}$. But it isn't clear that the power series can even be put such a form, and even if it can, why does that help me?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This is a pretty problem. I asked a question about it in MathOverflow a while back. Here is the solution using complex analysis, copying from the link above, and adding some details: (I've added the details in between square brackets. Ignore those paragraphs if you want to work out the details on your own.) Assign to each progression $A_i=(a_i+kb_i\\mid k\\in{\\mathbb N})$, $1\\le i\\le n$, its generating series, $f_i(x)=\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty x^{a_i+kb_i}$. Then $f_i(x)=x^{a_i}/(1-x^{b_i})$. Note the series converges for $|x|<1$. [ To see this: $\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty x^{a_i+kb_i}=x^{a_i}\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty (x^{b_i})^k$, and use that if $|t|<1$, the geometric series $\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty t^k$ equals $1/(1-t)$. ] Now, since the $A_i$ partition ${\\mathbb N}$, we have $\\sum_{i=1}^n f_i(x)=\\sum_{m=1}^\\infty x^m=x/(1-x)$. [ For this, observe that if $m\\in A_i$, then $x^m$ is one of the terms being added in $f_i(x)$, and $x^m$ is not a term in any of the other series $f_j$ for $j\\ne i$. ] If all the $b_i$ are different, let $b$ be the largest, and fix a primitive $b$-th root of unity $\\zeta$. Now let $x\\to\\zeta$ to reach a contradiction. [ In detail, $\\zeta=e^{2\\pi i/b}$ is a primitive $b$-th root of unity ($i$ the square root of $-1$). This means that $\\zeta^b=1$, if $k$ is an integer, then $\\zeta^k=1$ iff $k$ is a multiple of $b$, and if $z^b=1$, then $z=\\zeta^n$ for some integer $n$. You then have that  $$\\frac{x^{a_1}}{1-x^{b_1}}+\\dots+\\frac{x^{a_n}}{1-x^{b_n}}=f_1(x)+f_2(x)+\\dots f_n(x)=\\sum x^m=\\frac x{1-x}. $$\nCall $(*)$ this equation. When $x\\to\\zeta$, we obtain on the right hand side of $(*)$ the fraction $\\displaystyle \\frac{\\zeta}{1-\\zeta}$. Note here that $\\zeta\\ne 1$ because we are assuming we have at least two arithmetic progressions, so $b>1$. On the other hand, if $b_j\\ne b$, then $$ \\frac{x^{a_j}}{1-x^{b_j}}\\to\\frac{\\zeta^{a_j}}{1-\\zeta^{b_j}} $$ and $\\zeta^{b_j}\\ne 1$ because $b>b_j$. But if $b_j=b$, then $\\displaystyle \\frac{x^{a_j}}{1-x^{b_j}}\\to\\infty$ because $\\zeta^{b_j}=\\zeta^b=1$. The contradiction is that the left hand side of $(*)$ converges to $\\infty$, while the right hand side does not. ] This shows that the largest of the common differences must appear at least twice. As Gerry Myerson pointed out in MO, this argument is due to D J Newman. It appears in his book A Problem Seminar , problem 90, on page 18, with solution on page 100.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about proving that the positive integers can't be partitioned into a finite number of arithmetic sequences with distinct steps, except for the trivial case. The hint mentions using complex analysis, specifically writing the generating function as a sum of terms like z^a/(1-z^d). \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The problem states that each arithmetic sequence has a step d, which is a positive integer, and they need to have distinct steps. The partition is into a finite number of such sequences. The trivial case is when there's only one sequence with a=1 and d=1. So the assumptions would include:\n\n- The positive integers are partitioned into arithmetic sequences.\n- Each arithmetic sequence has a step d (a positive integer).\n- There are a finite number of arithmetic sequences in the partition.\n- Each arithmetic sequence in the partition has a distinct step d.\n- The trivial partition (single sequence a=1, d=1) is excluded.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"except the trivial sequence a=1, d=1\". But in the problem statement, it's phrased as \"Show that the positive integers cannot be partitioned into a finite number of arithmetic sequences s.t. each sequence has a distinct step d. (Except the trivial sequence a=1, d=1.)\". So the exception is the trivial partition. So the assumption is that the partition is into multiple sequences (so more than one), each with distinct steps. The trivial case is when there's only one sequence, which is allowed, but the problem is to show that you can't do it with multiple sequences each having distinct steps.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- The positive integers are partitioned into a finite number of arithmetic sequences.\n- Each arithmetic sequence in the partition has a distinct step d.\n- Each step d is a positive integer.\n- The trivial partition (a single sequence with a=1, d=1) is excluded.\n\nBut wait, the problem states \"except the trivial sequence a=1, d=1\", so maybe the assumption is that the partition is non-trivial. So in the problem, the user wants to show that such a partition isn't possible except for the trivial case. Therefore, the problem is to prove that there's no such partition into multiple arithmetic sequences with distinct steps. So the assumptions are that we have a partition into multiple arithmetic sequences, each with distinct steps d, and we need to show that this is impossible.\n\nSo structuring the assumptions:\n\n1. The positive integers are partitioned into a finite number of arithmetic sequences.\n2. Each arithmetic sequence has a step d that is a positive integer.\n3. Each arithmetic sequence has a distinct step d.\n4. The partition excludes the trivial case of a single arithmetic sequence with a=1 and d=1.\n\nThen the problem is to show that such a partition is impossible.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is stated as \"Show that the positive integers cannot be partitioned into a finite number of arithmetic sequences with distinct steps, except for the trivial case.\" So the assumptions are that if you try to partition them into multiple arithmetic sequences with distinct steps, it's impossible. The trivial case is allowed, but the problem is about the impossibility of non-trivial partitions.\n\nSo the problem statement is: Show that the positive integers cannot be partitioned into a finite number of arithmetic sequences (each with distinct step d) except the trivial partition.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The positive integers are partitioned into a finite number of arithmetic sequences.\n- Each arithmetic sequence has a step d (positive integer).\n- All steps d are distinct.\n- The partition is non-trivial (i.e., not just the single sequence a=1, d=1).\n\nBut the problem is to show that this is impossible, so the formatted problem would list the assumptions and then state the problem as proving that such a partition cannot exist.\n\nWait, the original question says \"Show that the positive integers cannot be partitioned into a finite number of arithmetic sequences s.t. each sequence has a distinct step d. (Except the trivial sequence a=1, d=1.)\" So the task is to prove that it's impossible except for the trivial case. Therefore, the problem is to prove that such a partition is impossible when you have multiple sequences with distinct steps. So the assumptions would include that the partition is into multiple sequences with distinct steps, and the problem is to show impossibility.\n\nPutting it all together, the Assumption section should list each condition:\n\n1. The positive integers are partitioned into a finite number of arithmetic sequences.\n2. Each arithmetic sequence has the form {a, a+d, a+2d, ...} where a and d are positive integers.\n3. Each arithmetic sequence in the partition has a distinct step d.\n4. The partition is non-trivial (i.e., excludes the case of a single sequence with a=1 and d=1).\n\nProblem: Prove that such a partition is impossible.\n\nBut I need to make sure each assumption addresses only one property applied to one object. Let me check:\n\n1. The partition is of the positive integers into a finite number of arithmetic sequences. (This is one condition about the partition)\n2. Each arithmetic sequence in the partition has step d (positive integer). (This is about each sequence's step)\n3. All steps d in the partition are distinct. (Each sequence has a unique d)\n4. The partition is not the trivial case (single sequence a=1, d=1). (This excludes the trivial case)\n\nYes, each is a separate assumption, each about one property.",
