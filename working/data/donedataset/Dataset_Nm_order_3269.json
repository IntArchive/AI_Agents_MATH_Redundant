    "Content": "While pondering over this question , I came across another interesting one. I am familiar with infinite tetration and its convergence over the reals. Nevertheless, when I saw this power tower, I couldn't help but wonder which distributions of $\\pm$ signs make this converge or diverge. For instance: $$e^{-e^{-e^{...}}}={}^\\infty(e^{-1})< \\infty \\\\ e^{e^{e^{...}}}={}^\\infty e \\to \\infty$$ Let's define $\\forall n\\geq 1,\\epsilon_n \\in {\\pm 1}$ as the n th sign of the power tower $$P_\\epsilon=e^{\\epsilon_1e^{\\epsilon_2e^{...}}}$$ defined recursively as $$\n[P_\\epsilon]_1(x) =e^{\\epsilon_1 x}\\\\ [P_\\epsilon]_{n+1}(x) = [P_\\epsilon]_{n}(e^{\\epsilon_{n+1} x})\\\\ [P_\\epsilon]_n(e) = [P_\\epsilon]_n\\\\\n$$ Then, evidently, the first terms of $\\epsilon_n$ are irrelevant, only the assymptotic behaviour is important. If we take $$\\epsilon_n=\\begin{cases}1&\\text{for } n\\equiv 0 \\mod k \\\\-1 &\\text{else }\\end{cases}$$ would this converge for some $k$ ? Lastly, one can conjure of all sorts of patterns for these $(\\epsilon_n)_{n\\in \\mathbb{N}}:$ what if the $(-1)$ s are only for prime indexes? What if $\\epsilon$ is $−1$ with probability $(1−p)$ and $1$ with probability $p$ ? I think this last question is very interesting, but probably hard to solve. It would seem an important threshold occurs if the expected value $\\mathbb{E}(\\epsilon)=0$ , or $p=\\frac{1}{2}$ , as the limit case for convergence is $${}^\\infty(e^{e^{-1}})<\\infty$$ My guess is, for $\\epsilon$ with $\\mathbb{E}(\\epsilon)>0$ it will diverge a.s. and for $\\mathbb{E}(\\epsilon)<0$ it will converge a.s., but I have no idea on how to prove it. This reminds me a lot of Kolmogorov's three series theorem, although I doubt it can be solved in a similar manner. I hope I haven't missed something that would make this problem trivial, that would be very disappointing. Thanks! (feel free to edit to make it look better, or to add more appropriate tags) EDIT :This question has been edited to account for the non-associativity of exponentiation, a fact I, somehow, seemed to have momentarily forgotten.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Um... I'm not sure if I'm missing something, but I believe that if any of the $\\epsilon_n=-1$ for $n\\ge 1$ , then the value of the expression converges. Allow me to explain why. Before I start, this is my first bounty, so I'm not really sure what the rules and standards of proof are. I know I could've gone into more detail, but I don't think it would've helped with understanding the proof, and I think the lemmas I skipped over would be fairly obvious/intuitive and tedious to prove. I'm open to feedback, but I think my response answers the question well. Conventions: $\\overline{\\mathbb{R}}=[-\\infty,\\infty]=\\mathbb{R}\\cup\\{-\\infty, \\infty\\}$ $[x,y]=\\{z\\in \\overline{\\mathbb{R}} \\mid x\\le z\\le y\\}$ $[x] = [x,x] = \\{x\\}$ . If $a=[x]$ , then $a$ is unique. $\\mu([a,b])=b-a$ is the standard measure on $\\overline{\\mathbb{R}}$ . This means that $\\exp([a,b])=[e^a,e^b]$ and $-[a,b]=[-b,-a]$ , where $e^{-\\infty}=0$ and $e^{\\infty}=\\infty$ . We are studying the \"reverse-sequence\" of sets $a_{n-1}=\\exp(\\epsilon_na_n)$ , where $\\epsilon=(\\epsilon_1,\\epsilon_2\\cdots)$ and $\\epsilon_n\\in\\{-1,1\\}$ for $n\\ge 1$ .  My understanding of convergence is that if $a_{\\omega}=\\overline{\\mathbb{R}}$ for some transfinite number $\\omega$ , then $a_0$ will be unique, containing a single value. There are three cases: $\\epsilon$ contains no $-1$ s, $\\epsilon$ contains finite $-1$ s, and $\\epsilon$ contains infinite $-1$ s. If $\\epsilon$ contains no $-1$ s, then $a_0=\\exp(\\exp(\\exp(\\cdots)))$ . It is pretty clear that $a_0=[\\infty]$ . However, as I will prove, this is the only case where $a_0$ diverges in any fashion. If $\\epsilon$ contains a finite number of $-1$ s, then let $n$ be the last number such that $\\epsilon_n=-1$ . We know that $a_n=\\exp(\\exp(\\exp(\\cdots)))=[\\infty]$ , so $a_{n-1}=\\exp(\\epsilon_na_n)=\\exp(-[\\infty])=[0]$ . Then, $a_0$ is a finite sequence of exponentials away from $a_{n-1}$ , so $a_0$ is also finite and unique. Now, let's consider the case where there are an infinite number of $-1$ s. Let $\\omega$ be some transfinite number where $\\epsilon_{\\omega}=-1$ . By \"transfinite\" I mean that if $b(\\omega)_n=a_{\\omega-n}$ , then $a_0=\\lim_{\\omega\\to\\infty}b(\\omega)_{\\omega}$ . (Yeah, it's not great notation, but I'm sure you can figure out what I mean.) We know that $a_{\\omega+1}\\subseteq[-\\infty,\\infty]$ . Assuming the worst case scenario, let $a_{\\omega+1}=[-\\infty,\\infty]$ . Then, $\\epsilon_{\\omega+1}a_{\\omega+1}=\\pm[-\\infty,\\infty]=[-\\infty,\\infty]$ , and $a_{\\omega}=\\exp(\\epsilon_{\\omega+1}a_{\\omega+1})=\\exp([-\\infty,\\infty])=[0,\\infty]$ . This means that $a_{\\omega-1}=\\exp(\\epsilon_{\\omega} a_{\\omega})=\\exp(-[0,\\infty])=[0,1]$ . Let $\\Omega=(\\Omega_0,\\Omega_1\\ldots)$ be the sequence of values less than or equal to $\\omega$ , in descending order, such that $\\epsilon_{\\Omega_i}=-1$ . Also, let's define a function $E:\\left(\\{1,2\\ldots\\}, [0,\\infty]\\right)\\to [0,1]$ such that: $E(1,x)=e^{-x}$ and $E(d+1,x)=E(d,e^x)$ for $d\\ge 1$ . Then, it is easy to see that $a_{\\Omega_{i+1}-1}=\\exp(-\\exp(\\exp(\\cdots\\exp(a_{\\Omega_i-1}))))=E(\\Omega_{i+1}-\\Omega_i,a_{\\Omega_i-1})$ . I claim that not only is $\\mu(a_{\\Omega_{i+1}-1})<\\mu(a_{\\Omega_i-1})$ , but the decrease is large to justify that $\\lim_{i\\to\\infty}\\mu(a_{\\Omega_{i}-1})=0$ , for any difference $d=\\Omega_{i+1}-\\Omega_i$ . This is because $E(d,x)$ is Lipschitz-continuous for all $d$ on $[0,1]$ , with Lipschitz coefficient $K=1$ . In fact, for $d > 1$ , $K$ is much smaller. Unfortunately, when $d=1$ , $e^{-x}$ has a slope of $-1$ at $x=0$ . Because the Lipschitz bound is only touched at one point on the edge, we can write that $|x-y|>K|E(d,x)-E(d,y)|>|E(d,x)-E(d,y)|$ for all $x,y\\in[0,1]$ . This means that $\\mu(E(d,a))<\\mu(a)$ , for any set $a\\subseteq[0,1]$ . Furthermore, because $E$ is a smooth function, there can be no \"catch-points\" where the decay of the size of $a$ would stop. Therefore, after an infinite number of passes through $E$ , the size of $a$ would approach $0$ . This means that if we start from progressively larger values of $\\omega$ , the size of $a_0$ will be calculated to be smaller and smaller, so that in the limit $a_0$ will have size $0$ . Therefore, $a_0$ is unique. Therefore, the value of the expression $\\exp(\\epsilon_1\\exp(\\epsilon_2\\cdots))$ has a unique value that is constrained in a convergent manner by the set $a_0$ as $\\omega$ approaches $\\infty$ , when there are infinitely many $-1$ s in $\\epsilon$ . We see that regardless of whether there are finitely many (at least one) or infinitely many $-1$ s in $\\epsilon$ , the expression converges.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this question and structure it according to the required format. The user is asking about the convergence of a probabilistic power tower with alternating signs. \n\nFirst, the assumptions. The problem defines a power tower with each term being e raised to either a positive or negative multiple of the next term. The signs ε_n are either +1 or -1. The recursive definition of [P_ε]_n(x) involves these signs. The user is considering different distributions for ε_n, such as periodic signs (like every k-th term being +1), signs based on prime indexes, and a probabilistic model where each ε_n is +1 with probability p and -1 with probability 1-p. The main focus seems to be on the probabilistic case, especially when the expected value E(ε) is zero (p=1/2). The user hypothesizes that convergence depends on whether E(ε) is positive or negative.\n\nSo, the assumptions need to list all the conditions and properties applied to each object. Let's break them down:\n\n1. For each n ≥ 1, ε_n is either +1 or -1. So that's one assumption about ε_n.\n2. The power tower is defined recursively: [P_ε]_1(x) = e^{ε_1 x}, and then each subsequent term is [P_ε]_{n+1}(x) = [P_ε]_n(e^{ε_{n+1} x}). So that's the recursive definition.\n3. The convergence of P_ε is determined by the asymptotic behavior of ε_n. The user states that the first terms are irrelevant.\n4. The specific case where ε_n follows a periodic pattern (every k-th term is +1, else -1). This is a particular distribution of signs.\n5. Another case where ε_n is -1 for prime indexes. Another distribution.\n6. The probabilistic model where each ε_n is +1 with probability p and -1 with probability 1-p. This is another assumption about the distribution of ε_n.\n7. The expected value E(ε) = 0 when p = 1/2. This is a condition on the expectation.\n8. The conjecture that if E(ε) > 0, the tower diverges almost surely, and if E(ε) < 0, it converges almost surely. This is the hypothesis to be proven.\n\nNow, the problem is to determine under what distributions of ε_n (specifically focusing on the probabilistic case with E(ε)) the power tower converges or diverges. The user is asking whether the tower converges almost surely when the expected value is negative and diverges when it's positive, particularly in the probabilistic model.\n\nI need to ensure each assumption is a single property applied to one object. So each bullet point in the assumption list should be a separate line. Let me structure that.\n\nAssumption:\nFor all n ≥ 1, ε_n ∈ {+1, -1},\nThe power tower P_ε is defined recursively by [P_ε]_1(x) = e^{ε_1 x} and [P_ε]_{n+1}(x) = [P_ε]_n(e^{ε_{n+1} x}),\nThe convergence of P_ε depends only on the asymptotic behavior of ε_n,\nε_n follows a periodic pattern where ε_n = +1 if n ≡ 0 mod k and ε_n = -1 otherwise (for some k),\nε_n is -1 for prime indices and +1 otherwise,\nEach ε_n is +1 with probability p and -1 with probability 1-p (independently),\nThe expected value E[ε_n] = 0 when p = 1/2,\nIt is conjectured that if E[ε_n] > 0, P_ε diverges almost surely, and if E[ε_n] < 0, P_ε converges almost surely.\n\nProblem:\nDetermine for which distributions of the signs ε_n (particularly when ε_n are independent with E[ε_n] = 2p - 1) the power tower P_ε = e^{ε_1 e^{ε_2 e^{...}}} converges or diverges almost surely. Specifically, prove whether P_ε converges almost surely when E[ε_n] < 0 and diverges almost surely when E[ε_n] > 0.\n\nWait, the user's main question is about the probabilistic case where each ε_n is ±1 with probabilities p and 1-p. The problem is to determine if convergence occurs almost surely based on the expected value. So the key problem is to prove or disprove the conjecture that E[ε] >0 leads to divergence and E[ε]<0 leads to convergence a.s.\n\nIn the example given, the original problem had the assumption that n is divisible by 7. But here, the user is considering multiple scenarios but the main focus is the probabilistic case. So the problem should be framed around that.\n\nSo perhaps the problem statement is: Prove that when ε_n are independent with E[ε_n] = 2p -1, the power tower P_ε converges almost surely if E[ε_n] < 0 and diverges almost surely if E[ε_n] >0.\n\nBut the user also mentions other distributions like periodic or primes. However, the main question is about the probabilistic case. So the problem statement should encapsulate that. However, in the original question, the user asks several things: the case with periodic signs (would it converge for some k?), primes, and the probabilistic case. So perhaps the problem is more general, but the user's main interest is the probabilistic one.\n\nBut according to the example, we need to structure the problem. The example extracted the main problem and assumptions. Here, the problem is the convergence of the power tower with probabilistic signs. So the assumptions include the definition of the tower, the distribution of ε_n (probabilistic), and the conjecture based on E[ε].\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nEach ε_n is independently +1 with probability p and -1 with probability 1-p,\nThe power tower P_ε is defined recursively as [P_ε]_1(x) = e^{ε_1 x} and [P_ε]_{n+1}(x) = [P_ε]_n(e^{ε_{n+1} x}),\nThe convergence of P_ε depends only on the asymptotic behavior of the sequence {ε_n},\nThe expected value E[ε_n] = 2p - 1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the power tower P_ε converges almost surely when E[ε_n] < 0 and diverges almost surely when E[ε_n] > 0.\n\nBut the user also mentioned other distributions, but the main focus is the probabilistic case. The original problem mentions multiple scenarios, but the user is particularly interested in the probabilistic one. However, the problem statement as per the user's words is \"what if ε is −1 with probability (1−p) and 1 with probability p ? I think this last question is very interesting, but probably hard to solve.\" So the main problem here is the probabilistic case. Therefore, the formatted problem should be about that.\n\nBut the example given in the instruction included the assumptions as separate lines, each addressing one property. So let's list all relevant assumptions:\n\n1. Each ε_n ∈ {+1, -1} for all n ≥ 1.\n2. The power tower P_ε is defined recursively: [P_ε]_1(x) = e^{ε_1 x}, [P_ε]_{n+1}(x) = [P_ε]_n(e^{ε_{n+1} x}).\n3. The convergence of P_ε depends only on the asymptotic behavior of {ε_n}.\n4. In the probabilistic case, each ε_n is +1 with probability p and -1 with probability 1-p.\n5. The expected value E[ε_n] = 2p - 1.\n6. The conjecture is that P_ε converges a.s. if E[ε_n] < 0 and diverges a.s. if E[ε_n] > 0.\n\nBut the problem is to prove this conjecture. So the assumptions would include the definition of P_ε, the distribution of ε_n, and the dependence on E[ε_n]. So structuring:\n\nAssumption:\nFor all n ≥ 1, ε_n ∈ {+1, -1},\nThe sequence {ε_n} is independent and identically distributed,\nEach ε_n is +1 with probability p and -1 with probability 1 - p,\nThe power tower P_ε is defined recursively by [P_ε]_n(e) = [P_ε]_n where [P_ε]_1(x) = e^{ε_1 x} and [P_ε]_{n+1}(x) = [P_ε]_n(e^{ε_{n+1} x}),\nThe convergence of P_ε depends only on the asymptotic behavior of {ε_n}.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the power tower P_ε converges almost surely if E[ε_n] < 0 and diverges almost surely if E[ε_n] > 0.\n\nBut in the original question, the user also mentions other cases (periodic, primes), but the main problem they want to focus on is the probabilistic case. So perhaps the problem statement should include those other cases as part of the problem, but according to the example, the formatted problem should extract the main problem. The user asks \"would this converge for some k?\" (referring to the periodic case), and the primes case, but the main focus is the probabilistic one. However, the user structures their own question with multiple parts but ends up emphasizing the probabilistic case. Since the example given in the instruction only extracted the main problem (the divisibility by 91, focusing on the assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7), here we should focus on the main problem the user is interested in, which is the probabilistic case with expectation.\n\nHence, the formatted problem would have the assumptions related to the probabilistic case and the problem statement about proving convergence/divergence based on the expectation. The other cases (periodic, primes) are other questions the user posed but perhaps not the main focus. However, the user does ask \"would this converge for some k?\" So maybe we need to include that as part of the problem. But in the original example, only the main problem was extracted. Since the user mentions several scenarios but the main conjecture is about the probabilistic case, we should structure the problem accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is more general: Determine for which distributions of the signs {ε_n} the power tower converges. But the user specifically conjectures about the probabilistic case with E[ε]. So to follow the user's main question, the problem is about the probabilistic case.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nFor each n ≥ 1, ε_n is +1 with probability p and -1 with probability 1 - p,\nThe sequence {ε_n} is independent,\nThe power tower P_ε is defined recursively as [P_ε]_n(e) = e^{ε_1 e^{ε_2 e^{...}}} with the recursion [P_ε]_{n+1}(x) = [P_ε]_n(e^{ε_{n+1} x}),\nThe convergence of P_ε depends on the asymptotic properties of {ε_n},\nThe expected value of ε_n is E[ε_n] = 2p - 1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that if E[ε_n] < 0, then P_ε converges almost surely, and if E[ε_n] > 0, then P_ε diverges almost surely.\n\nThat seems to capture the main problem. I need to ensure each assumption is one line. Let me list them each as separate points:\n\nAssumption:\nFor all n ≥ 1, ε_n ∈ {+1, -1},\n{ε_n} are independent random variables,\nEach ε_n is +1 with probability p and -1 with probability 1 - p,\nThe power tower P_ε is defined recursively by [P_ε]_1(x) = e^{ε_1 x},\n[P_ε]_{n+1}(x) = [P_ε]_n(e^{ε_{n+1} x}),\nThe convergence of P_ε depends only on the asymptotic behavior of {ε_n},\nThe expected value E[ε_n] = 2p - 1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that P_ε converges almost surely when E[ε_n] < 0 and diverges almost surely when E[ε_n] > 0.\n\nYes, this seems correct. Each assumption is a single property, applied to one object. The problem is to prove the convergence/divergence based on the expectation.",
