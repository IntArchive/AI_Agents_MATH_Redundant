    "Content": "Let $(M,g)$ be a Riemannian manifold of dimension $n$ with Riemannian connection $\\nabla,$ and let $p \\in M.$ Show that there exists a neighborhood $U \\subset M$ of $p$ and $n$ (smooth) vector fields $E_1,...,E_n \\in \\chi (U),$ orthonormal at each point of $U,$ s.t. at $p,$ $\\nabla_{E_i}E_j(p)=0.$ What I've found so far ; Let $V$ be a normal neighborhood at $p.$ Let $(W,x(x_1,...,x_n))$ be a local coordinate system at $p$ s.t. $x(W) \\subset V.$  Let $\\{X_i:=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}\\}$ be the standard basis of $T_pM.$ By Gram-Schmidt, there exists an orthonormal basis $\\{E_i\\}$ of $T_pM.$ Consider the orthonormal frame $E_i(t),$ by parallel transporting $\\{E_i(0)=E_i\\}$ along a  a geodesic $\\gamma :I \\to M$ starting at $\\gamma(0)=p$ and ending in $\\gamma(1)=q,$ where $q \\in V.$ This gives us an orthonormal frame at each point of $V.$ To satisfy the second condition, let $E_i(t)=\\sum_{l}a_{li}X_l$ and  $E_j(t)=\\sum_{s}b_{sj}(t)X_s.$ Then $$\\nabla_{E_i}E_j=\\sum_{k}(\\sum_{l,s} a_{li}(t)b_{sj}(t)\\Gamma^k_{ls}+E_i(b_{kj}))X_k,$$ where $\\Gamma^k_{is}$ are Christoffel symbols.

    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $(U,\\phi)$ be a coordinate neighborhood of $p$ and let $g_{ij}$ and $\\Gamma_{ij}^{k}$ denote the Riemannian metric tensors and the Christoffel symbols, respectively. If we recall that $g_{ij}=(E_i,E_j)$ and $\\Gamma_{ij}^{k}=\\nabla_{E_i}E_j(E_k)$ for all $1\\leq i,j,k\\leq n$ (where $M$ is a smooth $n$-manifold and $E_1,\\dots,E_n$ are the coordinate frames on $(U,\\phi)$), then we need only have $g_{ij}=\\delta_{ij}$ on $U$ and $\\Gamma_{ij}^{k}(p)=0$. You are right in choosing a normal coordinate system at $p$, that is, choosing a normal coordinate neighborhood $(U,\\phi)$ at $p$. Let me recall that this means choosing an orthonormal basis $F_1,\\dots,F_n$ of the tangent space $T_p(M)$, choosing a star-shaped neighborhood of the origin in $T_p(M)$ which is diffeomorphically mapped onto $U$ under the exponential mapping $\\text{exp}_p:D_p\\to M$ (where $D_p$ is an open subset of $T_p(M)$ containing $0$) and defining $\\phi=\\exp_{p}^{-1}$ on $U$ (here we identify $T_p(M)$ with $\\mathbb{R}^n$ by the linear isomorphism mapping $F_i$ onto $e_i$, $1\\leq i\\leq n$, where $e_1,\\dots,e_n$ is the standard basis of $\\mathbb{R}^n$). In normal coordinates, the geodesics are of the form $y^i=a^it$ where $a_i$ is a constant for all $1\\leq i\\leq n$. If you prove this, then you should easily be able to see that $\\Gamma_{ij}^{k}(p)=0$ for all $1\\leq i,j,k\\leq n$ by looking at the second-order ordinary differential equation of geodesics. You can also check that $g_{ij}(p)=\\delta_{ij}$ for all $1\\leq i,j\\leq n$. I hope this helps!",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. So, the question is about showing the existence of a local geodesic frame on a Riemannian manifold. Let me parse through the details and see how to structure it according to the required format.\n\nFirst, the problem states: Let (M, g) be a Riemannian manifold of dimension n with Riemannian connection ∇, and let p be a point in M. We need to show there's a neighborhood U around p and n smooth vector fields E₁,...,Eₙ on U that are orthonormal at each point, and at p, the covariant derivatives ∇_{E_i} E_j(p) are zero.\n\nThe user has already tried some steps. They mentioned using a normal neighborhood V at p, a local coordinate system (W, x) around p with coordinates in V, and the standard basis X_i = ∂/∂x_i. They applied Gram-Schmidt to get an orthonormal basis {E_i} at T_pM, then parallel transported these along geodesics to get an orthonormal frame over V. Then they considered expressing E_i and E_j in terms of the coordinate basis, computed the covariant derivative, and arrived at some conditions involving Christoffel symbols and the derivatives of the coefficients.\n\nNow, the user is stuck at how to make sure that ∇_{E_i} E_j(p) = 0. The key seems to be setting up the frame such that at p, those Christoffel terms vanish. But how?\n\nWait, I remember that in normal coordinates, the Christoffel symbols vanish at the point p. Is that right? Because in normal coordinates, the connection coefficients vanish at the center of the coordinate system. So maybe if we use normal coordinates, then Γ^k_ls(p) = 0. If that's the case, then the first term in their expression (sum over l,s a_li(0) b_sj(0) Γ^k_ls) would be zero at p. Then the remaining term is E_i(b_{kj})(p). So they need to ensure that E_i(b_{kj})(p) = 0.\n\nBut how can they arrange that? The E_i are parallel transported along geodesics, so they are parallel fields, meaning that their covariant derivative along the geodesic is zero. Wait, but parallel transport preserves the inner product, so the frame remains orthonormal. However, does that imply something about the derivatives of the coefficients b_{kj}?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Instead of using the coordinate-induced frame, maybe construct the frame such that their covariant derivatives vanish at p. How to do that? Maybe by adjusting the frame near p so that their first derivatives vanish at p.\n\nWait, another idea: if we take an orthonormal frame obtained by parallel transport along radial geodesics from p (which is what the user did), then in normal coordinates, the connection coefficients vanish at p. So, in that case, the expression ∇_{E_i} E_j(p) would be equal to the ordinary derivative of E_j in the direction of E_i at p, since the Christoffel terms are zero there. But since the E_i are parallel transported, their covariant derivatives along the geodesics are zero. However, the issue is that parallel transport gives that ∇_{\\dot{\\gamma}} E_j = 0 along the geodesic γ, but here we are taking ∇_{E_i} E_j at p. Since at p, the E_i are the orthonormal basis vectors, and the connection coefficients vanish, maybe the covariant derivative ∇_{E_i} E_j(p) is just the ordinary derivative, which can be arranged by choosing the frame appropriately.\n\nWait, perhaps the user needs to use the fact that in normal coordinates, the coordinates are such that the geodesics through p are represented by straight lines, and the Christoffel symbols vanish at p. So if we construct the frame by parallel translating the orthonormal basis along these radial geodesics, then the resulting frame would have zero covariant derivative at p. Because when you parallel transport a vector field along a geodesic, the covariant derivative along that geodesic is zero. But does that imply that the covariant derivatives in other directions at p are zero?\n\nHmm, maybe not directly. Wait, at p, we can consider the covariant derivative ∇_{E_i} E_j(p). Since the frame is parallel along the geodesics radiating from p, but not necessarily along other directions. However, at the point p itself, if the connection coefficients vanish, then ∇_{E_i} E_j(p) is just the directional derivative of E_j in the direction E_i at p. But if the frame is constructed by parallel transport along radial geodesics, then the derivatives of the frame fields in the radial directions (i.e., along E_i) are zero. But what about the derivatives in other directions?\n\nWait, maybe I need to recall the concept of a \"Riemannian normal coordinate system\". In such coordinates, the Christoffel symbols vanish at p, but their derivatives do not. So at p, the Christoffel symbols are zero. Therefore, the expression for the covariant derivative ∇_{E_i} E_j(p) would involve the partial derivatives of the components of E_j in the direction E_i, but since the Christoffel terms are zero at p, we just have ∇_{E_i} E_j(p) = (E_i(E_j^k))(p) ∂/∂x_k, where E_j^k are the components of E_j in the coordinate basis.\n\nBut how can we ensure that E_i(E_j^k)(p) = 0? If the frame {E_j} is obtained by parallel transport along radial geodesics, then their components in the normal coordinates might have certain properties. For instance, along each geodesic γ(t) starting at p, the parallel transport of E_j(0) = E_j gives E_j(t) which is constant in the parallel transport sense. In normal coordinates, the coordinates of E_j(t) along γ(t) would be t times the initial direction, but maybe the components of E_j in the coordinate basis are constant along the geodesic? If so, then the derivative of E_j in the direction E_i (which is the radial direction) would be zero. But if that's the case, then ∇_{E_i} E_j(p) would indeed be zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user needs to adjust the frame near p so that not only are they orthonormal, but also their derivatives at p vanish. This might involve using a specific frame constructed via the exponential map and parallel transport, ensuring that the covariant derivatives vanish at p.\n\nPutting this together, the key assumptions here are:\n\n1. (M, g) is a Riemannian manifold of dimension n.\n2. ∇ is the Riemannian connection on M.\n3. p is a point in M.\n4. The goal is to find a neighborhood U of p with orthonormal vector fields E₁,...,Eₙ on U.\n5. Each E_i is smooth.\n6. At each point in U, the vector fields E₁,...,Eₙ are orthonormal.\n7. At the point p, the covariant derivatives ∇_{E_i} E_j(p) = 0 for all i, j.\n\nSo when structuring the problem, these are the assumptions. The problem is to show the existence of such a neighborhood U and vector fields E_i.\n\nThe original problem mentions that the user considered a normal neighborhood, used parallel transport to create an orthonormal frame, and then tried to compute the covariant derivative at p. The key step they need is realizing that in normal coordinates, the Christoffel symbols vanish at p, and that the parallel-transported frame's derivatives (in the coordinate basis) at p can be made to satisfy the necessary conditions. Alternatively, maybe choosing the frame such that their first derivatives vanish in the normal coordinates.\n\nTherefore, the structured problem should list all these assumptions line by line, each addressing one property. The problem is to show the existence of such a frame with those conditions.",
