    "Content": "This question was asked in ISI BStat / BMath 2018 entrance exam : Let $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a continuous function such that\n  for all $x\\in\\mathbb{R}$ and $t\\ge 0$ , $$f(x)=f(e^{t}x)$$ Show that $f$ is a constant function. My attempt: Suppose that $f$ is not a constant function. Then $f(0)\\ne f(x_0)$ for some $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ . We eliminate the possibilities that $x_0>0$ and $x_0<0$ , thus proving that our assumption was wrong. Case 1: ( $x_0>0$ ). Let $k$ be any real number between $f(0)$ and $f(x_0)$ (not inclusive). Then by the intermediate value theorem,  there exists $y_0 \\in (0, x_0)$ such that $f(y_0)=k$ . But $f(y_0)=f\\left( e^{\\ln \\left( \\frac{x_0}{y_0}\\right)  } y_0\\right) = f(x_0)$ which contradicts our assumption that $f(y_0)$ was between $f(0)$ and $f(x_0)$ . Case 2: ( $x_0<0$ ). Let $k$ be any real number between $f(0)$ and $f(x_0)$ (not inclusive). Then by the intermediate value theorem,  there exists $y_0 \\in (x_0, 0)$ such that $f(y_0)=k$ . But $f(x_0)=f\\left( e^{\\ln \\left( \\frac{y_0}{x_0}\\right)  } x_0\\right) = f(y_0)$ , a contradiction again. Is this proof correct? I was probably looking for a direct proof if there's any. Alternative proofs are welcome.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "An alternative proof: put $x=e^{-t}$ to get $f(e^{-t})=f(1)$ for all $t \\geq 0$ . This im plies $f(x)=f(1)$ for all $x \\in (0,1]$ . Next note that $f(x)=f(2x)$ for all $x$ : just take $t=\\ln (2)$ ). You now see easily that $f(x)=f(1)$ for all $x >0$ . Since $f(-x)$ satisfies the same hypothesis it follows that $f$ is a constant on $(-\\infty, 0)$ also. By continuity the constant values for $x <0$ and $x >0$ must be the same.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let's start by reading the original question carefully.\n\nThe problem states: Let f: R → R be a continuous function such that for all x in R and t ≥ 0, f(x) = f(e^t x). We need to show that f is a constant function. The user provided their attempt using contradiction and the intermediate value theorem, but they're asking if their proof is correct and if there's a direct method.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem mentions that f is continuous, and for every real x and every t ≥ 0, f(x) = f(e^t x). So each assumption should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nLet me parse that:\n\n1. The function f is defined from R to R. So the domain and codomain are real numbers.\n2. f is continuous. That's a key assumption here because continuity is essential for applying theorems like IVT or in using properties of continuous functions on R.\n3. For all x in R and for all t ≥ 0, f(x) = f(e^t x). This condition needs to be broken down. Wait, the problem states \"for all x∈ℝ and t≥0, f(x)=f(e^{t}x)\". So two variables here: x and t. But each assumption should address one property. Maybe split into two? Or since it's a condition that applies to both x and t, but perhaps list it as a single assumption. Wait, the example given in the user's instruction lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. So here, maybe:\n\n- f is continuous.\n- For every real number x, f(x) = f(e^t x) holds for all t ≥ 0.\n\nBut wait, the original problem statement says \"for all x∈ℝ and t≥0\", so the condition is that for any x and any t ≥0, f(x) = f(e^t x). So that's a single condition but involving both x and t. So perhaps the assumption is:\n\n- For all real numbers x and for all t ≥ 0, f(x) = f(e^t x).\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. Hmm. Let me check the example again. The original example had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. So here, perhaps split into two assumptions? But in this case, the condition is a functional equation involving x and t. Maybe it's better to state it as one assumption because it's a single equation involving both variables. But the user's example separated different conditions even when they applied to the same object. So maybe here, since the equation involves both x and t, but they are quantified over all x and all t, maybe it's considered a single assumption. Alternatively, perhaps breaking it into two parts: the function f is continuous, and the functional equation holds for all x and t. Wait, the problem statement says \"given f is continuous and f(x)=f(e^{t}x) for all x and t≥0\", so two conditions: continuity and the functional equation. Therefore, two assumptions:\n\n1. f is continuous.\n2. For all x in R and t ≥ 0, f(x) = f(e^t x).\n\nYes, that makes sense. Each of these is a separate condition. So in the assumption section, list them as two separate points.\n\nThe problem then is to show that f is a constant function.\n\nLet me check if there are any other implicit assumptions. For example, the function is from R to R, which is given. But in the example provided by the user, the domain and codomain weren't listed as assumptions. Wait, in the example, the original problem was about A(n) defined for every integer n, and the formatted assumption was \"n is an integer\". So in that case, the domain of n was specified. Here, the function's domain and codomain are R to R. However, in the example, the fact that n is an integer is an assumption. So maybe here, the domain being R is part of the problem's setup but not an assumption? Wait, the user's example included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, which is part of the problem's setup. So perhaps here, the fact that f is defined from R to R is part of the problem statement but not an assumption. Wait, the problem says \"Let f: R → R be a continuous function...\" So the assumptions here are that f is continuous and that it satisfies the functional equation. The domain and codomain are part of the function's definition, but perhaps not listed as separate assumptions unless they impose specific conditions. In the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", so \"n is an integer\" was an assumption. Here, the function is defined on all real numbers, but maybe that's part of the problem's statement rather than an assumption. Wait, perhaps the answer should include all explicit conditions given. The problem states \"f: R → R is continuous\" and \"for all x ∈ R and t ≥0, f(x) = f(e^t x)\". So these are two separate conditions. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. f is a continuous function from R to R.\n2. For every real number x and every t ≥ 0, f(x) = f(e^t x).\n\nBut according to the user's example, the assumptions are listed as separate lines, each addressing one property. So the first assumption is f is continuous. The second assumption is the functional equation. The fact that f maps R to R might be considered part of the function's definition, but maybe in this case, it's included in the continuity assumption. Wait, in the example, the function A(n) was defined for every integer n, so the assumption was \"n is an integer\". Similarly, here, since f is defined as a function from R to R, perhaps that's an assumption. Wait, the problem says \"Let f: R → R be a continuous function...\", so the domain and codomain are part of the function's definition. But in the example, the original problem didn't state that n is an integer as an assumption but as part of the problem. However, in the formatted problem, the user included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So perhaps here, the fact that f is defined from R to R is an assumption. But wait, in the example, the original problem was \"for every integer n\", so n being an integer was part of the problem's condition. Similarly, here, f being defined on R to R is part of the problem's setup. But maybe the answer should list all given conditions as assumptions, except the actual conclusion. So the problem is to show f is constant, given that it's continuous and satisfies the functional equation. So the assumptions are continuity and the functional equation. The domain and codomain are part of the function's definition but perhaps not considered as separate assumptions here. Let me check the example again. The original example's problem was about A(n) for every integer n. The formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. So the first assumption is the domain of n (integers), and the second is an additional condition. So perhaps here, the function's domain and codomain (R to R) would be considered an assumption. However, the original problem here states \"Let f: R → R...\", so the fact that f is from R to R is part of the problem's setup. But in the example, the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So perhaps here, it's necessary to list that f is a function from R to R as an assumption. Wait, but maybe not. Because in the example, the problem was \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is that n is integer. Here, the problem says \"f: R → R\", so the domain is R. But in the formatted example, they included \"n is an integer\", so similarly here, perhaps we should include \"f is a function from R to R\" as an assumption. However, in the user's example, the problem's original statement was \"for every integer n\", which in the formatted problem became an assumption. So perhaps in this case, the function being from R to R is part of the problem's setup but not an assumption. Wait, but in the example, the problem was \"for every integer n\", which is part of the problem's statement, and the formatted problem listed that as an assumption. So similarly, here, the problem's statement defines f as a function from R to R, so that should be an assumption. However, in the example, the original problem didn't say \"Let n be an integer...\", but here the problem says \"Let f: R → R...\", so maybe the domain is part of the function's definition and hence an assumption. Alternatively, maybe not. Let me think again. The example's original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n)...\". So \"for every integer n\" is part of the universal quantifier, which in the formatted problem became \"n is an integer\". Here, the problem is \"Let f: R → R be a continuous function...\", so \"f is a function from R to R\" is part of the function's definition. Therefore, perhaps in this problem, the assumptions should include:\n\n1. f is a function from R to R.\n2. f is continuous.\n3. For all x ∈ R and t ≥ 0, f(x) = f(e^t x).\n\nBut the example only listed two assumptions: n is integer and n divisible by 7, but the original problem had \"for every integer n\". So perhaps in our case, the fact that f is from R to R is part of the problem's statement but not an assumption, similar to how the example didn't list the function A(n)'s definition as an assumption. Wait, in the example, the formatted problem didn't include the definition of A(n) in the assumptions, only the conditions on n. So perhaps in our case, the functional equation and continuity are the assumptions, and the domain is part of the function's definition, which is given in the problem statement. So the problem is to show that f is constant, given that it's continuous and satisfies the functional equation. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. f is continuous.\n2. For every real number x and every t ≥ 0, f(x) = f(e^t x).\n\nThat seems correct. The domain and codomain are part of the function's type, which is given, but the key assumptions are continuity and the functional equation.\n\nNow, the problem statement is to show that f is a constant function.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n- f is continuous.\n- For every real number x and every t ≥ 0, f(x) = f(e^t x).\n\nProblem:\nShow that f is a constant function.\n\nBut let me check the original problem again. The user's original problem said \"Let f: R → R be a continuous function such that for all x∈ℝ and t≥0, f(x)=f(e^{t}x). Show that f is a constant function.\" So the two key conditions are continuity and the functional equation. The domain is part of the function's definition but not an assumption per se. However, in the example, the assumption included \"n is an integer\", which is part of the problem's setup. So perhaps here, the domain is considered an assumption. But maybe not. Because in the example, the problem was about all integers n, so it's a universal quantifier. Here, the function is defined from R to R, which is part of the function's definition. However, in the user's example, the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So to be consistent, perhaps we should include the domain as an assumption here. Wait, the example's original problem was \"for every integer n\", which translates to the assumption \"n is an integer\". Similarly, here, the problem is about a function f defined on R, so perhaps \"f is a function from R to R\" is an assumption. However, in the example, the formatted problem listed the assumptions related to the variable in the problem. Here, the problem's variable is f, so the assumptions are about f's properties. So the function being from R to R is part of its definition, but maybe in the formatted problem, it's considered an assumption. But I'm a bit conflicted here. Let me check how the example was structured. The original example's formatted assumptions were:\n\nAssumption: \nn is an integer,\nn is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nIn the original problem, it was \"for every integer n\", so \"n is an integer\" is part of the problem's universal quantifier, which became an assumption. Similarly, here, \"Let f: R → R be...\" is defining the function's domain and codomain, which could be considered as an assumption. However, in the example, the function A(n) was defined without specifying n's type in the assumptions, but in the formatted problem, they included \"n is an integer\". Therefore, perhaps here, \"f is a function from R to R\" should be an assumption. But the original problem's title was \"Given $f$ is continuous and $f(x)=f(e^{t}x)$...\", which suggests that the continuity and functional equation are the given conditions. Maybe the problem assumes that f is a function from R to R as part of the setup, and the assumptions are the additional conditions. However, to be safe, perhaps include the domain as an assumption. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- f is a function from R to R.\n- f is continuous.\n- For every real number x and every t ≥ 0, f(x) = f(e^t x).\n\nProblem:\nShow that f is a constant function.\n\nBut wait, the original example didn't include the function's definition (like A(n) being defined as 5^n(...) ) in the assumptions. The assumptions were about the variable n. Similarly, here, the assumptions are about the function f's properties. The fact that f is a function from R to R is part of its definition, but maybe in this context, it's considered part of the problem statement rather than an assumption. The problem is to show that f is constant given that it's continuous and satisfies the functional equation. So perhaps the domain is part of the function's type and not an assumption. Therefore, the correct assumptions are continuity and the functional equation. Hence:\n\nAssumption:\n- f is continuous.\n- For every real number x and every t ≥ 0, f(x) = f(e^t x).\n\nProblem:\nShow that f is a constant function.\n\nYes, that seems correct. The domain is R to R, which is part of the function's definition, but the key conditions given are continuity and the functional equation.",
