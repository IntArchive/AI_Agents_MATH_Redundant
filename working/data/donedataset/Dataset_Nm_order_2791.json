    "Content": "Could you help, please. I need the information about the ultrafilters, namely, any ideas how one can see that they exist and a proof of the fact that for any ultrafilter every sequence on a compact topological space has a limit. I hope these basic facts can be collected somewhere in a popular form, I would be grateful for a reference.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I hope that we both have in mind the same notion of convergence of a sequence along an ultrafilter on $\\mathbb N$ . $\\newcommand{\\Flim}{\\operatorname{\\mathcal F-lim}}$ I know that you asked for a reference. Instead of giving a reference, I have copied a part of my LaTeXed notes I made for myself sometimes ago instead. In these notes I work with functions and ultrafilters on arbitrary set. (For $M=\\mathbb N$ you'll get sequences.) I wrote these notes basically for the reason that I found the results useful, I did not know any reference at that time, and wanted to keep proof for myself somewhere. I later found  book [HS], where this is shown, and I mention it in these notes. But I do not think that this book would be good for you if this is for the first time you encountered this notion. (In my opinion, if someone has the maturity required to read this book, he should be able to figure out the proof of the result about ultrafilters and compact spaces by himself.) Added later: In the meantime I found a few more references and I've added them to this post. For other references: Some facts about the limit along an ultrafilter are collected in the paper M.A.Alekseev, L.Yu. Glebskii, E.I.Gordon. On approximations of groups, group actions and Hopf algebras. You can also find something in the book Komjath, Totik: Problems and Theorems in Classical Set Theory , but they work only with real sequences. The proof for the case of real sequences is also given at planetmath . If the case of bounded real sequences is sufficient for you, you can find many resources. You can find many references for the existence of free ultrafilters. E.g. already mentioned books by Komjath and Totik, or Janich. If you do not have access to these books, you could try to Google for filter ultrafilter zorn . Snippet from my notes (this links to version which is still unfinished): The following result can be found in [HS, Theorem 3.48 ]. [HS,Theorem 3.52] shows that this is a characterization of compact spaces. Further references: This blog post and  [D, Theorem 4.3.5], [T, p.64, Claim 14.1], [F, 2A3Se(i)]. Proposition: Let $\\mathcal F$ be an ultrafilter on $M$ , $X$ be a compact space and $f:M\\to X$ be a map. Then $\\Flim f$ exists. Recall that $\\Flim f=x$ means that $f^{-1}(U)\\in\\mathcal F$ holds for each neighborhood $U$ of $x$ . This is equivalent to the claim that the filterbase $f[\\mathcal F]$ converges to $x$ in $X$ . We give a direct proof and also transformation to a known result from general topology. (Namely the result that in a compact space every ultrafilter has a limit - in the usual topological sense, see here or in the book suggested by Theo .) Proof 1. Suppose that no point $x\\in X$ is an $\\mathcal F$ -limit of $f$ . Hence for every $x$ there is a neighborhood $U_x$ such that $f^{-1}[U_x]\\notin\\mathcal F$ . By compactness, there is an finite subcover of $\\{U_x; x\\in X\\}$ . Let us denote the sets from this subcover by $U_1,\\dots,U_n$ . For each $i=1,\\dots,n$ we have $f^{-1}[{U_i}]\\notin\\mathcal F$ . Since $\\mathcal F$ is ultrafilter, this is equivalent to $f^{-1}[{X\\setminus U_i}]\\in\\mathcal F$ . Now $\\bigcap_{i=1}^n (X\\setminus U_i)=\\emptyset$ , since $U_1,\\dots,U_n$ is a cover and this implies $\\bigcap_{i=1}^n f^{-1}[{X\\setminus U_i}]= f^{-1}[{\\bigcap_{i=1}^n {X\\setminus U_i}}]=\\emptyset$ . Consequently $\\emptyset\\in\\mathcal F$ , a contradiction. Proof 2. Is is easy to observe that the filter given by the filterbase $f[\\mathcal F]$ is an ultrafilter on $X$ . Indeed, if $A\\subseteq X$ , then $f^{-1}[A] \\cup f^{-1}[X\\setminus A]=M$ , hence one the sets $f^{-1}[A]$ , $f^{-1}[X\\setminus A]$ belongs to $\\mathcal F$ and thus one of the sets $A$ , $X\\setminus A$ is in $f[\\mathcal F]$ . Since $X$ is compact and $f[\\mathcal F]$ is an ultrafilter, there is a limit $x$ of $f[\\mathcal F]$ in $X$ . Then $x=\\Flim f$ . [D] Jacques Dixmier. General Topology .

Since this question appeared twice in comments, it might be good to add this information to the answer. (For some people this can be useful approach - depending on your background. Or it can work other way too - if you already know something about $\\mathcal F$ -limits, this might help you when you learn about Stone-Čech compactification.) The $\\mathcal F$ -limit is related to Stone-Čech compactification in a very natural way. Let us work with Stone-Čech compactification $\\beta M$ of $M$ endowed with the discrete topology. One of possibilities how to construct $\\beta M$ is to define $\\beta M$ to be the set of all ultrafilters on $M$ and endow it with the topology generated by the sets $A^*=\\{\\mathcal F\\in\\beta M; A\\in\\mathcal F\\}$ , where $A\\subseteq M$ . It can be shown that the map which assigns to a point $m\\in M$ the corresponding principal ultrafilter is an embedding an that this topological space fulfills all conditions from the definition of Stone-Čech compactification. Now for any function $f:M \\to X$ where $X$ is compact we have unique extension to $\\overline f: \\beta M \\to X$ . The $\\mathcal F$ -limits can be understood as the values of this extension: For any ultrafilter $\\mathcal F\\in\\beta M$ we have $$\\overline f(\\mathcal F)=\\Flim f.$$ Let me add something about another thing that was addressed in the comments below. The $\\mathcal F$ -limit defined in the way described in this post generalizes both the notion of limit of a net and limit of a filter in the way it is usually defined in general topology. (This is Bourbaki's approach - they define this rather general notion first and various notions of limits are special cases. I do not claim that this approach would be good for students who see the nets or filters for the first time. But for someone, who is already familiar with both of them, it might be interesting to know about a unifying approach.) Namely if $X$ is a topological space if we take the identity map $id_X \\colon X\\to X$ , then $\\mathcal F-\\lim id_X$ is the same thing as the same thing as the usual definition of a limit of a filter. For net on a directed set $(D,\\le)$ we can take section filter generated by the set $D_a=\\{d\\in D; d\\ge a\\}$ , where $a\\in D$ . More details about this can be found again in my notes here . And this aspect is discussed in this question, too: Where has this common generalization of nets and filters been written down?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about ultrafilters and convergence in compact spaces. The user wants two things: existence of ultrafilters and a proof that every sequence in a compact space converges along an ultrafilter. \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem mentions ultrafilters in general, so one assumption is that we're dealing with an ultrafilter. Then, the compact topological space is another condition. Also, the problem states \"every sequence,\" so the sequence is an arbitrary one in that space. However, the original question doesn't specify any particular properties beyond the space being compact and the ultrafilter being arbitrary. Wait, but the user is asking for a proof that \"for any ultrafilter, every sequence on a compact space has a limit.\" Wait, no, actually the problem statement might be slightly different. Let me re-read the original question.\n\nThe user wrote: \"a proof of the fact that for any ultrafilter every sequence on a compact topological space has a limit.\" Hmm. Wait, is that the correct statement? Because usually, the theorem is that in a compact space, every ultrafilter converges, but sequences along ultrafilters... Maybe there's a confusion here. Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to the concept of limits along ultrafilters for sequences. \n\nBut regardless, the problem as posed by the user is: for any ultrafilter, every sequence on a compact space has a limit. So the assumptions would be:\n\n1. We have an ultrafilter (presumably a free one, but the problem doesn't specify; but the existence of ultrafilters in general would require the axiom of choice, so maybe that's part of the first part of the question about existence). However, in the problem part, the user is splitting the original question into two parts: existence of ultrafilters and the convergence. \n\nSo, when structuring the problem part, the user wants the problem to be \"Prove that for any ultrafilter, every sequence on a compact topological space has a limit.\" Then the assumptions would be:\n\n- The space is compact.\n- The ultrafilter is given (any ultrafilter).\n- The sequence is arbitrary in the space.\n\nBut the user's example included assumptions as separate points. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nU is an ultrafilter,\nX is a compact topological space,\n(x_n) is a sequence in X.\n\nProblem:\nProve that (x_n) has a limit along U.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to show that in a compact space, every ultrafilter converges, but the user is phrasing it in terms of sequences. Wait, there's a difference between convergence of ultrafilters and convergence of sequences along ultrafilters. \n\nWait, in topology, an ultrafilter converges if there's a point such that the ultrafilter contains all neighborhoods of that point. A sequence can have a limit along an ultrafilter, which is a different concept. The limit along an ultrafilter U of a sequence (x_n) is a point x such that for every neighborhood V of x, the set {n | x_n ∈ V} belongs to U. So the problem as the user states is about sequences in compact spaces having limits along any ultrafilter. But compactness usually ensures that every ultrafilter converges, but here it's about sequences. Maybe the user is conflating the two concepts. However, given the original question, I need to structure the problem as per what's asked.\n\nOriginal problem parts:\n1. Help with seeing that ultrafilters exist.\n2. Proof that for any ultrafilter, every sequence on a compact space has a limit.\n\nSo for the second part, the problem would be: Prove that for any ultrafilter U, every sequence (x_n) in a compact topological space X has a limit along U.\n\nAssumptions for that problem would be:\n- U is an ultrafilter,\n- X is a compact topological space,\n- (x_n) is a sequence in X.\n\nBut the example given by the user had assumptions as properties applied to one object each. So:\n\nAssumption:\nU is an ultrafilter,\nX is a compact topological space,\n(x_n) is a sequence in X.\n\nProblem:\nProve that (x_n) has a limit along U.\n\nThen, the first part of the original question is about existence of ultrafilters. The user wants to \"see that they exist\". So perhaps another problem: Prove that every filter is contained in an ultrafilter. But the original question isn't phrased as a problem to prove but as a request for information. However, since the user provided an example where the original problem was to prove divisibility, and the formatted problem turned it into the problem statement with assumptions, perhaps here we need to structure each part as a separate problem. But the user's example only formatted one problem. However, the original question here has two parts: existence of ultrafilters and the convergence fact. But the user wants each problem structured with assumptions and problem. So maybe split into two separate entries. But the user's instruction says to structure \"the problem\" as per the format. The original question is a single question asking for two things. However, the user's example extracted one problem. Perhaps the assistant should split into two problems. But given the example, maybe each part is a separate problem. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem lists assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the user had written \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, but that's incorrect. Wait, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, the expression is divisible by 91. However, in the example, the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. But that's not part of the original problem. That seems like a mistake. Wait, the user might have made a mistake in their example. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That's incorrect. Maybe it was a typo, perhaps the original problem had a divisibility by 7 condition. But in the example given by the user, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That's conflicting. So perhaps the example is flawed. But regardless, the user wants us to follow their format. So in the current problem, perhaps we need to structure each part as separate problems.\n\nBut the original question has two parts: existence of ultrafilters and the convergence result. So perhaps two separate problems. But the user's example had one problem. However, the user's instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\", implying per problem. But the original question here is a single question with two parts. Maybe the user wants each part to be structured. Alternatively, perhaps the problem refers to the second part (the convergence) and the existence is part of the assumptions. But the user's example didn't split into multiple problems. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem as posed by the user is about the convergence, and the existence is a separate part. But the user's instruction says to structure the problem. The original question on Math SE is asking for both existence and the proof. So maybe split into two problems. But how to fit into the format? The user's example had one problem with assumptions and problem. Perhaps we need to structure each part as a separate problem. But the user didn't specify. Since the user's example only formatted one problem, perhaps here we need to do the same. Let me check the original question again.\n\nOriginal question: \"I need the information about the ultrafilters, namely, any ideas how one can see that they exist and a proof of the fact that for any ultrafilter every sequence on a compact topological space has a limit.\"\n\nSo two tasks: 1. Show ultrafilters exist. 2. Prove that for any ultrafilter, every sequence in compact space has a limit. So these are two separate problems. Therefore, perhaps two separate formatted entries. However, the user's example only formatted one problem, so maybe each part is a separate problem. Let me proceed to structure each part.\n\nFirst problem: existence of ultrafilters.\n\nAssumptions: None given in the problem, but to show existence, we need to assume that we have a filter. Wait, the existence of ultrafilters is usually via the ultrafilter lemma, which states that every filter is contained in an ultrafilter. So perhaps the assumption is that we have a filter. However, the original question just asks to \"see that they exist\", so maybe the problem is to prove that every filter can be extended to an ultrafilter. But the original question is phrased as a request for a proof or a reference. So the formatted problem for existence would be:\n\nAssumption: F is a filter on a set.\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists an ultrafilter U containing F.\n\nBut the user's original question just asks to \"see that they exist\", so perhaps more basic. Maybe the problem is to prove that any non-principal ultrafilter exists, but that requires AC. Alternatively, the existence of any ultrafilter. The existence of ultrafilters in general follows from the ultrafilter lemma, which is equivalent to the axiom of choice. So perhaps the problem is: Prove that every filter is contained in an ultrafilter.\n\nThen, the second problem is about convergence.\n\nAssumption: U is an ultrafilter,\n\nX is a compact topological space,\n\n(x_n) is a sequence in X.\n\nProblem: Prove that (x_n) has a limit along U.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be that every ultrafilter converges in a compact space. Because the user mentioned \"every sequence on a compact topological space has a limit\", but perhaps they confused ultrafilter convergence with sequence limits. The standard theorem is that a space is compact iff every ultrafilter converges. So maybe the problem is:\n\nAssumption: X is a compact topological space,\n\nU is an ultrafilter on X.\n\nProblem: Prove that U converges.\n\nBut the user's wording is about sequences having limits along ultrafilters. That's a different concept. The limit of a sequence along an ultrafilter. But in compact spaces, does every sequence have a limit along every ultrafilter? Not necessarily. For example, in [0,1], take the sequence 0,1,0,1,... and an ultrafilter that contains the even indices. Then the limit along that ultrafilter would be 0, and another ultrafilter containing the odd indices would have limit 1. But regardless, the limit exists. Wait, but in compact spaces, every sequence has a limit along some ultrafilter. But the user says \"for any ultrafilter every sequence on a compact topological space has a limit\". That is, for any ultrafilter U and any sequence (x_n), (x_n) converges along U. But that's not necessarily true. Wait, for example, take the sequence x_n = 1/n in [0,1]. Let U be an ultrafilter containing the cofinite sets. Then the limit along U is 0. If U is a different ultrafilter, say containing the indices where x_n is in (0.1, 0.2), but that might not converge. Wait, no. The limit along an ultrafilter U is defined as x such that for every neighborhood V of x, {n | x_n ∈ V} ∈ U. In a compact space, every sequence has a limit point, but along a given ultrafilter, does the sequence necessarily converge? Wait, yes. Because for any ultrafilter U on N, the image filter under the sequence is a filter on X, which is contained in an ultrafilter. Since X is compact, that ultrafilter converges to some x, which would be the limit along U. Wait, but the image filter might not be an ultrafilter, but extending it to an ultrafilter, which converges. However, the limit along U is defined as the limit of the image ultrafilter. Wait, maybe I need to think carefully.\n\nLet me recall: Given a sequence (x_n) in X and an ultrafilter U on N, the limit along U is the point x such that for every neighborhood V of x, {n | x_n ∈ V} ∈ U. In compact space X, for any sequence and any ultrafilter U, does such x exist? Yes. Because consider the image filter base {A ⊆ X | A = {x_n | n ∈ S} for some S ∈ U}. The closure of this filter base is a filter, which is contained in an ultrafilter. Since X is compact, this ultrafilter converges to some x. Then, for any neighborhood V of x, there exists a set in the ultrafilter contained in V, hence {n | x_n ∈ V} ∈ U. Hence x is the limit along U. Therefore, in compact spaces, every sequence has a limit along any ultrafilter. So the problem as posed by the user is correct.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nU is an ultrafilter on the natural numbers,\nX is a compact topological space,\n(x_n) is a sequence in X.\n\nProblem:\nProve that (x_n) has a limit along U.\n\nBut in the original question, the user wrote \"for any ultrafilter every sequence on a compact topological space has a limit\". So the assumptions are that U is any ultrafilter (presumably on N, since we're talking about sequences), X is compact, and (x_n) is a sequence in X. Then the problem is to prove the existence of the limit along U.\n\nTherefore, combining all this, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nU is an ultrafilter on the natural numbers,\nX is a compact topological space,\n(x_n) is a sequence in X.\n\nProblem:\nProve that (x_n) has a limit along U.\n\nAnd for the existence of ultrafilters, the other part of the original question would be:\n\nAssumption:\nF is a filter on a set S.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists an ultrafilter U on S containing F.\n\nBut since the user's example formatted a single problem, perhaps each part is a separate entry. However, the user's instruction says to structure \"the problem\" as per the format. Given that the original question has two parts, but the example combined a similar problem into one, I think the user wants each part as a separate formatted problem. Therefore, the final answer would have two formatted problems:\n\nFirst problem (existence):\n\nAssumption:\nF is a filter on a set S.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists an ultrafilter U on S containing F.\n\nSecond problem (convergence):\n\nAssumption:\nU is an ultrafilter on the natural numbers,\nX is a compact topological space,\n(x_n) is a sequence in X.\n\nProblem:\nProve that (x_n) has a limit along U.\n\nBut the user might expect both to be in one answer. However, the example only formatted one problem. Given the user's instruction says \"structure that problem\", referring to the original problem on Math SE, which has two parts, but the example only formatted one, I think the user might want each part as a separate formatted problem. But to follow the example strictly, perhaps only the convergence part is considered the main problem, and the existence is another. But the user's example didn't have multiple problems. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the user might have intended each part to be a separate problem. In the original problem, the user wrote \"I need the information about the ultrafilters, namely, any ideas how one can see that they exist and a proof of the fact that...\". So two separate tasks. Therefore, two formatted problems.\n\nBut in the absence of explicit instruction, perhaps the answer should include both. However, since the user's example only formatted one problem, maybe I should do the same. Alternatively, the user might prefer both. To be safe, I'll structure both.",
