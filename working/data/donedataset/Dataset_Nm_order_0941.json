    "Content": "So, $A$ is a $n \\times n$ matrix with integer entries. The question is to prove that $A^{-1}$ has all integer entries if and only if ${\\rm det}\\ (A) =\\pm 1$ . I know that $A^{-1}= {\\rm adj}(A)/{\\rm det}(A)$ , but I have no idea where to go from there for the forward direction. Any help here would be greatly appreciated. For the backwards direction, I think I am okay. I plugged the 1 and the -1 options into $ {\\rm adj}(A)/{\\rm det}(A)$ . So, I know that $A^{-1}= {\\rm adj}(A)$ or $-{\\rm adj}(A)$ . Then I said that because the ${\\rm adj}(A)$ is simply the matrix of co-factors of $A$ , and because $A$ has all integer entries, then ${\\rm adj}(A)$ will have all integer entries, which will mean that $A^{-1}$ will have all integer entries. Is that okay? Or am I missing something else? Thank you!!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The direction you've done is correct to a t and is exactly how I'd do it. As for the other direction, you might be tempted to try to reverse your argument but that definitely isn't going to go your way. Here's a hint: suppose that $A^{-1}$ has integer entries, then we know that $$\\det(A^{-1}A) = \\det(I) = 1$$ but we also have that $\\det(A^{-1}A) = \\det(A^{-1})\\det(A)$. Can you take it from here?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to prove that a square matrix A with integer entries has an inverse with integer entries if and only if the determinant of A is ±1. Let me first parse the original question to extract the key assumptions and structure the problem correctly.\n\nThe original problem states that A is an n×n matrix with integer entries. The task is to show the equivalence between A⁻¹ having integer entries and det(A) being ±1. The user also mentioned their approach for the backward direction (if det(A)=±1, then A⁻¹ has integer entries) using the adjugate formula but is unsure about the forward direction (if A⁻¹ has integer entries, then det(A)=±1).\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions properly. The main assumptions here are:\n\n1. A is an n×n matrix.\n2. All entries of A are integers.\n\nThese are the only given conditions. The problem then is to prove the biconditional statement about A⁻¹ having integer entries and the determinant being ±1.\n\nWait, in the example provided by the user, the assumptions were split into separate lines, each addressing one property applied to one object. So here, the matrix A has two properties: it's n×n and its entries are integers. Therefore, these should be two separate assumptions.\n\nNow, the problem is to prove the equivalence. However, in the example, the user might have included additional constraints, like in their example where the original problem had \"for every integer n\" but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". But in this case, the original problem doesn't have extra constraints beyond the matrix being n×n with integer entries. So the assumptions are straightforward.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. The original problem says: \"A is a n×n matrix with integer entries. The question is to prove that A⁻¹ has all integer entries if and only if det(A) = ±1.\" So the key assumptions are the two properties of A: size (n×n) and integer entries. The problem is the equivalence between A⁻¹ having integer entries and det(A) being ±1. So the formatted problem should list those two assumptions and then state the problem as proving the biconditional.\n\nHowever, in the example given by the user, they modified the original problem. The original problem had \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\". But in the current problem, there's no such modification needed because the original problem's assumptions are already clear. So I shouldn't add or remove any assumptions here. Just list what's given: A is n×n, entries are integers.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nA is an n×n matrix,\nAll entries of A are integers.\nProblem:\nProve that A⁻¹ has integer entries if and only if det(A) = ±1.\n\nWait, but in the example provided by the user, they might have misinterpreted the original problem. Let me check their example again. The original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect unless the original problem had that condition. Wait, no, looking back: the original problem was \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like an error. Maybe the user made a mistake there. But regardless, in this current problem, we need to stick to the original problem's assumptions.\n\nTherefore, for the current problem, the correct assumptions are the two properties of A: n×n and integer entries. The problem is the biconditional statement. So the formatted problem should be as above.\n\nNow, to verify, let's check the user's example. Wait, perhaps the user's example was incorrect. In the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That would actually change the problem. That seems like a mistake. Because if n is any integer, but the formatted problem restricts n to be divisible by 7, then the problem is altered. Perhaps the example was a bad one, or maybe there was a misunderstanding. However, in the current problem, we need to stick to what's given.\n\nTherefore, in the current case, the user's original problem states that A is an n×n matrix with integer entries. The task is to prove the equivalence. So the correct assumptions are the two points, and the problem is the biconditional. Hence, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nA is an n×n matrix,\nAll entries of A are integers.\nProblem:\nProve that A⁻¹ has integer entries if and only if det(A) = ±1.\n\nI think that's accurate. The user might have intended in their example to filter out unrelated information, but in this problem, there's no unrelated information to filter. The problem is already clearly stated. The user is asking for the assumptions and problem structure. Therefore, the answer should be as above.",
