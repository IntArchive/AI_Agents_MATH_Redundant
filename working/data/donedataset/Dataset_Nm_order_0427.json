    "Content": "An infinite sequence of pairwise distinct numbers $a_1, a_2, a_3, ...$ is defined thus: $a_n$ is the smallest positive integer number such that $\\sqrt{a_n+\\sqrt{a_{n-1}+...+\\sqrt{a_1}}}$ is positive integer. Prove that the sequence $ a_1, a_2, a_3, ... $ contains all positive integers numbers. My work: Let $a_1=1$ . Then $\\sqrt{a_2+1}$ is positive integer and $a_2$ is the smallest positive integer then $a_2=3$ . Then $\\sqrt{a_3+2}$ is positive integer and $a_3$ is the smallest positive integer then $a_3=2$ .

    "AcceptedAnswer": "Consider the sequence of square roots $s_n$, where $s_n=\\sqrt{a_n+s_{n-1}}$.  This sequence starts out $1,2,2,3,3,4,3,5,3,\\ldots$.  If we can show that every positive integer occurs at least once in this sequence, then we can conclude that every positive integer occurs (exactly once) in the sequence of $a_n$'s:  each integer $k$ must occur among the $a_n$'s no later than the first time $s_{n-1}=k^2-k$. Observe first that the sequence of $s_n$'s cannot recycle a finite set of values infinitely often, since $a_n=s_n^2-s_{n-1}$ must not repeat.  So there must be an infinite number of \"new\" values in the sequence. To show that every positive integer occurs in the sequence of $s_n$'s, it suffices to show that each \"new\" value in the sequence is precisely one more than the previous \"new\" value -- e.g., $7$ won't occur as an $s_n$ until after $6$ has occurred.  To prove this, note that if $s_1,s_2,\\ldots,s_{n-1}\\le k$, then $a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_{n-1}\\lt k^2$ (since $a_j=s_j^2-s_{j-1}$).  Since $(k+1)^2-s_{n-1}\\ge k^2+k-1\\gt a_j$ for all $j\\lt n$ and $a_n$ is the smallest positive integer (not already in the sequence) for which $a_n+s_{n-1}$ is a square, we must have $s_n\\le k+1$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor, read a Math Stack Exchange question, filter out the irrelevant info, and structure it into the specified format with assumptions and the problem statement. Let's start by looking at the example they provided to understand the format better.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. However, the formatted problem under \"Assumption\" listed two points: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems off because the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7. Hmm, maybe the example had a typo or maybe the user made a mistake there. But regardless, I need to focus on the current problem given.\n\nThe current problem from Math Stack Exchange is about a sequence a_n where each a_n is the smallest positive integer such that the nested square root expression sqrt(a_n + sqrt(a_{n-1} + ... + sqrt(a1))) is a positive integer. The goal is to prove that this sequence contains all positive integers.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that the sequence is infinite, pairwise distinct numbers. So the assumptions would include:\n\n1. The sequence is infinite.\n2. Each term a_n is a positive integer.\n3. All terms in the sequence are pairwise distinct.\n4. For each n, a_n is the smallest possible positive integer such that the nested square root up to that term is an integer.\n\nWait, the problem says \"pairwise distinct numbers a1, a2, a3, ...\", so that's another assumption. Also, each a_n must be the smallest positive integer not already in the sequence (since they have to be distinct and contain all positive integers). But the problem statement says that the sequence is defined such that each a_n is the smallest positive integer making the nested sqrt an integer, and they are pairwise distinct. So the key assumptions are:\n\n- The sequence is infinite.\n- Each a_n is a positive integer.\n- All terms are pairwise distinct.\n- For each n, a_n is the smallest positive integer such that sqrt(a_n + sqrt(a_{n-1} + ... + sqrt(a1))) is a positive integer.\n- The sequence must contain all positive integers.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to prove that the sequence contains all positive integers. So the assumptions leading up to that would be the definition of the sequence. So in the \"Assumption\" section, we list the conditions given in the problem, not including what needs to be proven.\n\nSo the original problem states:\n\nAn infinite sequence of pairwise distinct numbers a1, a2, a3, ... is defined thus: a_n is the smallest positive integer such that sqrt(a_n + sqrt(a_{n-1} + ... + sqrt(a1))) is a positive integer. Prove that the sequence contains all positive integers.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. The sequence is infinite.\n2. Each term a_n is a positive integer.\n3. All terms in the sequence are pairwise distinct.\n4. For each n, a_n is the smallest positive integer such that the nested square root expression up to a_n is a positive integer.\n\nBut wait, in the example, they had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But in that case, the problem's original assumption didn't mention n being divisible by 7. Maybe the example was incorrect. But in our current problem, the assumptions are given in the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem says \"An infinite sequence of pairwise distinct numbers a1, a2, a3, ... is defined thus: a_n is the smallest positive integer number such that sqrt(a_n + sqrt(a_{n-1} + ... + sqrt(a1))) is positive integer.\"\n\nSo the assumptions here are:\n\n- The sequence is infinite.\n- All terms are pairwise distinct.\n- Each a_n is the smallest positive integer such that the nested sqrt is an integer.\n\nTherefore, each of these should be separate points in the assumptions.\n\nSo breaking it down:\n\nAssumption:\n- The sequence a1, a2, a3, ... is infinite.\n- Each term a_n is a positive integer.\n- All terms in the sequence are pairwise distinct.\n- For each n, a_n is the smallest positive integer such that sqrt(a_n + sqrt(a_{n-1} + ... + sqrt(a1))) is a positive integer.\n\nBut I need to make sure each assumption is a single line addressing one property applied to one object.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\n- The sequence is infinite.\n- Each term a_n is a positive integer.\n- All terms in the sequence are pairwise distinct.\n- For each positive integer n, a_n is the smallest positive integer such that sqrt(a_n + sqrt(a_{n-1} + ... + sqrt(a1))) is a positive integer.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's already given that the sequence is defined in this way. So these are the conditions given. The problem is to prove that the sequence contains all positive integers. So the assumptions are the definition of the sequence, and the problem is to prove that it covers all positive integers.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have the assumptions as per the definition and the problem as the proof statement.\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\nAssumption:\n- The sequence a1, a2, a3, ... is infinite.\n- Each term a_n is a positive integer.\n- All terms in the sequence are pairwise distinct.\n- For each n, a_n is the smallest positive integer such that sqrt(a_n + sqrt(a_{n-1} + ... + sqrt(a1))) is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the sequence a1, a2, a3, ... contains all positive integers.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included specific conditions on n. But in this case, the assumptions are about the sequence's properties. However, the example might have been incorrect. Let me check again.\n\nIn the user's example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem listed assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that seems to add a condition not present in the original problem, which is odd. Maybe there was a mistake there.\n\nBut for the current problem, I should stick to the given information. The problem states that the sequence is defined with a_n being the smallest positive integer such that the nested sqrt is an integer, the sequence is infinite and pairwise distinct. The task is to prove that all positive integers appear in the sequence.\n\nThus, the assumptions are the defining properties of the sequence, and the problem is the statement to prove.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is a single line. For instance:\n\nAssumption:\n- The sequence a1, a2, a3, ... is infinite.\n- Each term a_n in the sequence is a positive integer.\n- All terms in the sequence are pairwise distinct.\n- For each positive integer n, a_n is the smallest positive integer such that sqrt(a_n + sqrt(a_{n-1} + ... + sqrt(a1))) is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the sequence a1, a2, a3, ... contains all positive integers.\n\nI think that's accurate. The user's example had some possible error, but following the problem's actual statement, this should be correct.",
