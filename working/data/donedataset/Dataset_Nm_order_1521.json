    "Content": "Prove that T is diagonalizable if and only if the minimal polynomial of T has no repeated roots. EDIT: ( Over $\\Bbb C $ ) though it is obvious i am working over $\\Bbb C $ as one of my statements is not true over $ \\Bbb R $ I would like a better proof of this result what i did is below, there is the same question on here somewhere but only has an answer to one direction im looking for both. I proved the result by using a different equivalent statement to diagonalizable looking for any complete proof that is shorter. We notice that it is equivalent to prove that V has a basis consisting of eigenvectors of T iff the minimal polynomial of T has no repeated roots by theorem. $(\\Rightarrow ) $ First suppose that there is a basis $\\beta = (v_1,\\cdots , v_n ) $ consisting of eigenvectors of T. let $\\lambda_1 , \\cdots , \\lambda_m $ be distinct eigenvalues of T. Then for each $ v_i $ there exists a $\\lambda_k $ with $(T- \\lambda_k I) v_i =0 $ it then follows that $(T- \\lambda_1 I) \\cdots (T- \\lambda_mI) v_i =0 $ for each i as we can commute the operators. Since an operator that sends each vector in a basis to the $0$ vector is the $0$ operator we have that $(T- \\lambda_1 I) \\cdots (T- \\lambda_mI) =0 $ Thus the polynomial $(z-\\lambda_1) \\cdots (z-\\lambda_m ) $ when applied to T gives 0. but by theorem we know that that the minimal polynomial of T is a divisor of $(z-\\lambda_1) \\cdots (z-\\lambda_m ) $ which has no repeated roots so the minimal polynomial cannot possibly have repeated roots the result follows. $(\\Leftarrow ) $ Let us assume that the minimal polynomial has no repeated roots; if we let $ \\lambda_1 \\cdots \\lambda_m $ denote the distinct eigenvalues of T, this means the minimal polynomial of T is $(z-\\lambda_1) \\cdots (z-\\lambda_m ) $ It follows that $(T- \\lambda_1 I) \\cdots (T- \\lambda_mI) =0 $ Let $U_m $ be the subspace of a generalized eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda_m $. Since $ U_m $ is invariant under T by theorem we consider $ v\\in U_m $ let $u= (T- \\lambda_m I) v $ it follows that $u\\in U_m $  Hence $$ (T|_{U_m} - \\lambda_1 I ) \\cdots (T|_{U_m} - \\lambda_{m-1}I) u =   (T- \\lambda_1 I) \\cdots (T- \\lambda_mI) v =0 $$ by theorem we have that $( T- \\lambda_m I )|_{U_m} $ is nilpotent by previous question we have that 0 is the only eigenvalue of $( T- \\lambda_m I )|_{U_m} $. Thus $T|_{U_m} - \\lambda_jI $ is an invertable operator on $U_m $ for $j= 1, \\cdots , m-1 $ it then follows by $$ (T|_{U_m} - \\lambda_1 I ) \\cdots (T|_{U_m} - \\lambda_{m-1}I) u =   (T- \\lambda_1 I) \\cdots (T- \\lambda_mI) v =0 $$ that $u=0$ in other words, $v$ is an eigenvector of T! We have shown that every generalized eigenvector of T corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda_m $ is an eigenvector of T. However we choose $ \\lambda_m $ arbitrarily we could of just of easily relabeled the eigenvalues so that any of them was called $ \\lambda_m $. Therefore we have that every generalized eigenvector of T is actually an eigenvector of T. By theorem we have that there is a basis for V consisting of generalized eigenvectors of T but by above we have that there is a basis of V consisting of eigenvectors of T the desired result.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Clearly $T$ is diagonalizable if and only if we can decompose $V$ into a direct sum of eigenspaces $$V = \\ker (T-\\lambda_1I) \\dot+ \\ker(T - \\lambda_2 I) \\dot+ \\cdots \\dot+\\ker(T - \\lambda_k I)$$ since we can then take a basis of the form $$(\\text{basis for}\\ker(T-\\lambda_1I), \\text{basis for}\\ker(T-\\lambda_2I), \\ldots, \\text{basis for}\\ker(T-\\lambda_kI))$$ which yields a diagonal matrix representation of $T$ . You have already handled the direction ( $T$ is diagonalizable $\\implies$ minimal polynomial has no repeated roots). Conversely, assume that the minimal polynomial $\\mu_T$ has no repeated roots. Note that the above sum is direct: $$x \\in \\ker(T - \\lambda_i I) \\cap \\ker(T - \\lambda_j I) \\implies \\lambda_ix = Tx = \\lambda_jx \\implies i = j \\text{ or } x = 0.$$ It remains to prove that every $x$ can be written in the form $x = x_1 + \\cdots + x_k$ with $x_i \\in \\ker(T - \\lambda_iI)$ . Using the partial fraction decomposition we obtain: $$\\frac1{\\mu_T(x)} = \\frac1{(x-\\lambda_1)\\cdots(x-\\lambda_k)} = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\frac{\\eta_i}{(x-\\lambda_i)}$$ for some scalars $\\eta_i$ . Define $$Q_i(x) = \\frac{\\eta_i \\mu_T(x)}{x - \\lambda_i}$$ so that $\\sum_{i=1}^k Q_i = 1$ and $(x-\\lambda_i)Q_i(x) = \\eta_i \\mu_T(x)$ . Finally, notice that the desired decomposition is given by $$x = Q_1(T)x + Q_2(T)x + \\cdots + Q_k(T)x$$ with $Q_i(T) x \\in \\ker (T - \\lambda_i I)$ since $$(T - \\lambda_i I) Q_i(T)x = \\eta_i \\mu_T(T)x = 0.$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure the problem from the given Math Stack Exchange question. Let me read through the original question carefully. The user wants to prove that a linear operator T is diagonalizable if and only if its minimal polynomial has no repeated roots. They mentioned working over the complex numbers, which is important because diagonalizability can depend on the field, especially since real matrices might not have all eigenvalues in R.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The example given in the problem format includes assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Each assumption should be a single property applied to one object. In this case, the main objects are the linear operator T and the vector space V. \n\nAssumptions here would be:\n- T is a linear operator on a vector space V. (Since the problem is about T being diagonalizable, we need to know T acts on V.)\n- The vector space V is over the complex numbers. (The user edited to mention they're working over C, so that's a crucial assumption for the proof to hold.)\n- The minimal polynomial of T has no repeated roots. (This is part of the biconditional statement; the problem states \"if and only if\", so the minimal polynomial having no repeated roots is one condition, and T being diagonalizable is the other.)\n\nWait, but the problem is an \"if and only if\" statement. So in the formatted problem, the problem statement itself would be \"Prove that T is diagonalizable if and only if the minimal polynomial of T has no repeated roots.\" But the assumptions need to list the conditions given. However, in the example provided, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer, which is part of the problem's premise. Here, the problem doesn't have any extra assumptions beyond the structure of T and V. The user does mention working over C, so that's an important assumption. \n\nSo for the assumptions, I should include:\n- T is a linear operator on a finite-dimensional vector space V. (The problem might require finite-dimensionality to talk about minimal polynomials and diagonalizability. The original question doesn't specify, but in standard linear algebra, these topics usually assume finite dimension.)\n- The field of V is the complex numbers. (Because the user mentions working over C, and the proof might rely on eigenvalues existing, which is guaranteed over C.)\n- The minimal polynomial of T has no repeated roots. (But wait, this is part of the biconditional. However, in the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, the problem is to prove an equivalence, so the assumptions are the general conditions under which the statement holds. But maybe the assumptions are the general settings. Let me check the example again.)\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem listed assumptions as n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but that seems incorrect because the original problem was for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was not in the original. That might be an error. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal problem in example: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should just be n is an integer. But in the formatted problem, the user added \"n is divisible by 7\", which is not in the original. That seems like a mistake. Wait, perhaps the example is wrong? Because if the problem is to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem adds that n is divisible by 7, which restricts n. But the original problem didn't have that. Maybe that example is not correctly formatted. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. Because 91 is 7*13, maybe they intended to split the divisibility into 7 and 13. But the original problem didn't have that assumption. Hmm. Well, regardless, I have to follow the user's instructions.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user on Math Stack Exchange says \"Prove that T is diagonalizable if and only if the minimal polynomial of T has no repeated roots.\" The user also mentions working over C. So the key assumptions here are:\n\n1. T is a linear operator on a finite-dimensional vector space V over the complex numbers. (Necessary for eigenvalues to exist, and for the minimal polynomial to split into linear factors.)\n\n2. The minimal polynomial of T has no repeated roots. (This is part of the biconditional statement; when proving the \"if\" direction, this is the condition, and when proving the \"only if\" direction, T being diagonalizable leads to the minimal polynomial having no repeated roots.)\n\nBut the problem is to structure the problem into Assumption and Problem sections. Since the problem is an equivalence, the assumptions are the general conditions under which the equivalence holds. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- V is a finite-dimensional vector space over the complex numbers.\n\n- T is a linear operator on V.\n\nThen the problem is to prove the equivalence. Alternatively, since the original problem didn't mention finite-dimensional, but in the context of minimal polynomials and diagonalizability, finite-dimensional is assumed. However, the user's original question might not specify finite-dimensional. Let me check the original question again.\n\nOriginal question: The user says \"Prove that T is diagonalizable if and only if the minimal polynomial of T has no repeated roots.\" The user mentions that they are working over C. In the problem's body, they refer to V having a basis of eigenvectors and generalized eigenvectors. So finite-dimensional is implicit here because otherwise, the existence of a basis (in the infinite-dimensional case) is more complicated. So perhaps finite-dimensional is an assumption.\n\nSo compiling the assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\n- V is a finite-dimensional vector space over the complex numbers.\n- T is a linear operator on V.\n\nProblem:\nProve that T is diagonalizable if and only if the minimal polynomial of T has no repeated roots.\n\nBut in the example, they listed the assumptions as specific properties applied to one object each. So in the example, n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. So here, for each assumption line, each line is a single property applied to one object.\n\nTherefore, breaking down the current problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n1. V is a finite-dimensional vector space over the complex numbers.\n\n2. T is a linear operator on V.\n\n3. (But the problem is an equivalence, so perhaps the assumptions are just the general setting. The problem is not making any extra conditions beyond the structure of T and V.)\n\nWait, but in the example, the user added an assumption not present in the original problem. Wait, no. The original problem in the example was \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should be \"n is an integer\". But in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\", which was not in the original. That suggests that maybe the example is incorrect. But perhaps the user intended to filter out unrelated information. Wait, maybe in the original problem, the user had some other conditions but the example filtered out. Hmm. But given that, perhaps in the current problem, the key assumptions are that V is over C and finite-dimensional, and T is a linear operator on V.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nV is a finite-dimensional vector space over the complex numbers,\nT is a linear operator on V.\n\nProblem:\nProve that T is diagonalizable if and only if the minimal polynomial of T has no repeated roots.\n\nBut the original question mentions \"over C\" and the user edited to include that. So the field being C is important, as the result might not hold over R. So that should be an assumption.\n\nTherefore, each assumption line:\n\n1. V is a vector space over the complex numbers.\n\n2. V is finite-dimensional.\n\n3. T is a linear operator on V.\n\nBut in the example, each assumption is a single property applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nV is a finite-dimensional vector space over the complex numbers,\nT is a linear operator on V.\n\nProblem:\nProve that T is diagonalizable if and only if the minimal polynomial of T has no repeated roots.\n\nYes, that's correct. The problem's setting is V being a finite-dimensional complex vector space and T a linear operator on V. These are the necessary assumptions for the theorem to hold as stated. The original problem's user mentioned working over C, so including that in the assumptions is crucial.\n\nI think that's the correct structure. So the assumptions are the vector space is finite-dimensional over C, and T is a linear operator on it. The problem is the equivalence between diagonalizability and minimal polynomial having no repeated roots.",
