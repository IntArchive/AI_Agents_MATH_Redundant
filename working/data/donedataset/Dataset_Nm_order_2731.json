    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about proving that the group SL(2,ℝ) acts transitively on the upper half-plane 𝕌 using the Möbius transformations. The user wants the assumptions and problem clearly separated.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions. The group in question is SL(2,ℝ), which consists of 2x2 real matrices with determinant 1. The action is defined by the Möbius transformation z ↦ (az + b)/(cz + d). The upper half-plane 𝕌 is defined as those complex numbers z with Im(z) > 0. The problem is to show transitivity, meaning for any two points in 𝕌, there's a group element mapping one to the other.\n\nWait, but the example given in the prompt had assumptions that were specific conditions. Here, the assumptions are about the properties of the group, the action, and the space. Each assumption should address one property or condition of one object. Let me break it down:\n\n1. The group in consideration is SL(2,ℝ), so each matrix has real entries and determinant 1.\n2. The action is defined by the Möbius transformation formula provided.\n3. The upper half-plane 𝕌 is the set of complex numbers with positive imaginary part.\n4. The action's transitivity requires that for any two points in 𝕌, there exists a matrix in SL(2,ℝ) mapping one to the other.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions listed specific conditions on n, like being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions are more about definitions. The user's example included assumptions that might not be explicitly stated but are necessary for the problem. However, in this case, the problem is to prove transitivity, so the main assumptions are the definitions of the group, the action, and the space. Each should be a separate line.\n\nSo, the assumptions would be:\n\n- SL(2,ℝ) consists of 2×2 real matrices with determinant 1.\n- The group acts on the upper half-plane 𝕌 via the map z ↦ (az + b)/(cz + d).\n- 𝕌 is the set {z ∈ ℂ | Im(z) > 0}.\n- Transitivity requires that for any x, y ∈ 𝕌, there exists A ∈ SL(2,ℝ) such that A.x = y.\n\nBut wait, the transitivity is part of what needs to be proven, not an assumption. So maybe the assumptions are the properties given, not the conclusion. So the assumptions are:\n\n1. The group is SL(2,ℝ), which is the set of 2×2 real matrices with determinant 1.\n2. The action is defined by z ↦ (az + b)/(cz + d) for a matrix [[a, b], [c, d]] in SL(2,ℝ).\n3. The upper half-plane 𝕌 is defined as {z ∈ ℂ | Im(z) > 0}.\n\nThe problem then is to prove that this action is transitive, i.e., for any two points in 𝕌, there exists a matrix in SL(2,ℝ) mapping one to the other.\n\nSo each assumption is a separate line, each about one object's property. The problem is to prove transitivity. Let me check if I missed any conditions. The user's example included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem but was part of the assumptions. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7, but the formatted problem included it. Wait, looking back, the original example says:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that seems like the formatted problem added an assumption that wasn't in the original. But the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they included \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Wait, perhaps the example might have had a typo, but according to the user's example, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, even though the original problem didn't state that. That might be a mistake. However, in the current problem, we need to follow the user's format, which for the example included assumptions that may not have been in the original problem but are necessary. Wait, perhaps the user's example is incorrect, but we need to follow their format.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user is asking to structure the problem as per the example. In the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which might be part of a corrected or clarified problem. Wait, maybe the user intended to have the problem's assumptions listed even if they are not explicitly stated in the original question. However, in the example, the original problem's assumption was that n is any integer, but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7, which is incorrect. That suggests there might be an error in the example. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to have the problem structured by extracting implicit assumptions. But this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example is a mistake, but the user wants us to list the assumptions that are given in the problem. In the current problem, the original question states that SL(2,ℝ) acts on the upper half-plane via the given transformation, and the user is to prove transitivity. The assumptions would then be the definitions of the group, the action, and the space. So each of those would be separate assumptions.\n\nSo, applying that:\n\nAssumption:\n- SL(2,ℝ) is the group of 2×2 real matrices with determinant 1.\n- The action of SL(2,ℝ) on 𝕌 is defined by z ↦ (az + b)/(cz + d).\n- 𝕌 is the upper half-plane {z ∈ ℂ | Im(z) > 0}.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the action of SL(2,ℝ) on 𝕌 is transitive.\n\nBut the original question also mentions that the user feels there should be more to it than just citing invertibility, so maybe the problem is to rigorously show transitivity, which requires more than just invertibility.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would list the assumptions about the group, action, and space, then the problem is to prove transitivity. Each assumption is one line, addressing one property of one object.",
