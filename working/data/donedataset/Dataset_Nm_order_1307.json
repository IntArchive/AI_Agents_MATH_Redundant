    "Content": "I came across this question on the topology board at AoPS, where it hadn't really received an answer. It seems interesting, but I'm not sure how to solve it. Hopefully an answer will be found here. The question, from Dudley's Real Analysis and Probability , goes as A $C^1$ curve is a function $t\\mapsto (f(t),g(t))$ from $\\mathbb{R}$ into $\\mathbb{R}^2$ where the derivatives $f'(t)$ and $g'(t)$ exist and are continuous for all $t$. Show that $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is not a countable union of ranges of $C^1$ curves. In the google book there's also a hint to show the range of a $C^1$ curve on a finite interval is nowhere dense. So out of curiosity, what's a proper way to prove the hint that the range of a $C^1$ curve on a finite interval is nowhere dense ? I've read through the first few sections of the book up to the point of the exercise, and it covers compactness, product topologies, complete and compact metric spaces and metrics on function spaces, and the theorems of Dini, Arzela-Ascoli, and the Stone Weierstrass Theorem. I'm putting a bounty to see if there's a basic solution using only this knowledge, even if it may not be the most elegant. Added : I did a little research based on the comments I received. I know that $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is a complete metric space, and the Baire Category Theorem says every complete metric space is of the second category. I can decompose a curve into countably many curves defined on finite intervals, (like intervals of length $1$ maybe?). Then if $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is the countable union of ranges of curves, it would also be the countable union of the ranges of these countably many smaller curves with finite domains. However, if each curve on a finite interval has nowhere dense range, then $\\mathbb{R}^2$ would be the union of countable many nowhere dense sets and then be of the first category, contrary to the Baire Category Theorem. So why exactly is the range of a curve on a finite interval nowhere dense? It seems intuitively true. If I let $B=\\{(f(t),g(t))\\mid t\\in I\\}$ for some finite interval $I\\subset\\mathbb{R}$ be the range of some $C^1$ curve, then my feeling is this range looks like some \"segment\" in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. If $U\\subset\\mathbb{R}^2$ is any open set, I want to find an open $V\\subset U$ where $B\\cap V=\\emptyset$. Intuitively, it seems like I could just take some open ball of small enough radius in $U$ that doesn't meet $B$ in the plane, so the range is nowhere dense. Is there a more formal way to express this? Thanks.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here's an answer avoiding measure theory, or any advanced methods. First, if a curve $\\gamma\\colon\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}^2$ is $C^1$ then, for any $a < b$, the restriction of $\\gamma$ to $[a,b]$ has finite length $\\int_a^b\\vert\\gamma^\\prime(t)\\vert\\,dt$. Now, a finite length curve cannot be dense the unit square $[0,1]^2$. For any positive integer $n$, consider the $(n+1)^2$ points $(i/n,j/n)$, $0\\le i,j\\le n$. The distance between any two of them is at least $1/n$. So, any curve which is dense in the unit square must join these points, and hence have length at least $((n+1)^2-1)/n=n+2$. Let $n$ go to infinity. By scaling, this shows that a finite length curve cannot be dense in any open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Now suppose that we have a countable set of $C^1$ curves $\\gamma^i\\colon\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}^2$ ($i=1,2,\\ldots$). Then, $\\gamma^{ij}=\\gamma^i\\vert_{[-j,j]}$ ($i,j=1,2,\\ldots$) is a countable set of curves of finite length, so their images are compact and nowhere dense subsets of $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Finally, the Baire category theorem says that a countable sequence of closed nowhere dense subsets of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ cannot cover $\\mathbb{R}^2$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange problem into the specified format. The example provided shows that I need to extract assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nFirst, the original problem is about showing that ℝ² is not a countable union of ranges of C¹ curves. The user also mentions a hint about proving the range of a C¹ curve on a finite interval is nowhere dense, which is key here.\n\nSo, the main problem is to show ℝ² isn't a countable union of such curve ranges. The assumptions would relate to the properties of the curves involved. Let me parse the problem details:\n\n- A C¹ curve is defined as a function t ↦ (f(t), g(t)) where f' and g' exist and are continuous for all t.\n- The problem states to show ℝ² is not a countable union of these curve ranges.\n- The hint suggests showing the range of a C¹ curve on a finite interval is nowhere dense.\n\nThe user's approach uses the Baire Category Theorem. So, the key assumptions would involve the properties of the curves (C¹, defined on finite intervals) and the application of Baire's theorem.\n\nBreaking down assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object:\n\n1. Each curve is a C¹ function from ℝ to ℝ². So, the derivatives exist and are continuous.\n2. The curves are considered on finite intervals. The problem mentions decomposing curves into countably many with finite domains.\n3. The range of each curve on a finite interval is nowhere dense in ℝ².\n4. ℝ² is a complete metric space (for Baire's theorem).\n5. A countable union of nowhere dense sets is of the first category.\n\nBut in the example given, the assumptions were specific to the problem's conditions. Here, the problem's assumptions need to include the properties of the curves and their domains. The user also mentions decomposing into finite intervals, so the assumption that each curve is on a finite interval is important.\n\nWait, the original problem statement from the book says \"Show that ℝ² is not a countable union of ranges of C¹ curves.\" The curves are defined on ℝ, but the hint is about curves on finite intervals. The user's approach is to decompose each curve into countably many curves on finite intervals (like intervals of length 1), so that the original union becomes a countable union of countable unions, hence still countable. Then, if each of those has nowhere dense range, the entire union would be meager, contradicting Baire.\n\nTherefore, the key assumptions are about the curves being C¹, their domains being finite intervals (after decomposition), and their ranges being nowhere dense. But the problem itself is to show ℝ² isn't a countable union of curve ranges, but the user is focusing on proving the hint that the range on a finite interval is nowhere dense. However, the main problem is the original one, and the user is working through the hint.\n\nBut according to the example, the formatted problem should present the problem as stated, and the assumptions would be the conditions given. The original problem says \"Show that ℝ² is not a countable union of ranges of C¹ curves.\" So the assumptions would be:\n\n- Each curve is a C¹ function from ℝ to ℝ² (since the problem says \"ranges of C¹ curves\").\n- The curves are defined on ℝ (since the problem doesn't restrict to finite intervals, but the user's approach decomposes them into finite intervals).\n\nBut in the example, the assumption included that n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem, that wasn't stated. Wait, in the example, maybe the user made a mistake. Wait the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem in the example has an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which isn't in the original problem. That seems incorrect. Wait, perhaps the example is not correct, but the user provided it as an example. Maybe the example is wrong, but I should follow the user's structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the example is from the user's own formatting. In the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect because the original problem doesn't restrict n. But maybe the user included that assumption as part of filtering, which is confusing. Therefore, maybe the user's example is not accurate, but I have to follow the instruction to list all assumptions from the problem.\n\nWait, the user says: \"filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format\". So the task is to read the original problem, filter out unrelated info, and list assumptions. In the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, there's an assumption that \"n is divisible by 7\", which isn't in the original. This suggests that the user might have made a mistake in the example, but regardless, I need to follow their format.\n\nBut looking at the current problem: The original problem is to show ℝ² is not a countable union of ranges of C¹ curves. The user's question is about the hint to show that the range of a C¹ curve on a finite interval is nowhere dense.\n\nBut the problem as stated in the title is \"Why isn't ℝ² a countable union of ranges of curves?\" and the problem from Dudley's book is to show that ℝ² is not a countable union of ranges of C¹ curves.\n\nSo, the main problem is to show that ℝ² is not a countable union of ranges of C¹ curves.\n\nThe assumptions for this problem would be:\n\n- Each curve is a C¹ function from ℝ to ℝ² (i.e., derivatives exist and are continuous).\n- The problem is about the union of such ranges covering ℝ².\n- The curves are defined on all of ℝ, but the approach involves decomposing them into finite intervals.\n\nBut in the formatted example, the assumption was \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But in the original example problem, n is any integer, but the formatted problem added an assumption not present in the original. That seems like an error. Therefore, maybe the user intended to list the conditions given in the problem. So for the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. Each curve is a C¹ function from ℝ to ℝ² (i.e., functions t ↦ (f(t),g(t)) where f' and g' exist and are continuous).\n2. The problem considers the union over countably many such curves.\n\nBut the problem is to show that such a union cannot equal ℝ². The key is that each curve's range on a finite interval is nowhere dense, hence the entire union is meager, contradicting Baire's theorem.\n\nBut in terms of assumptions for the problem, the problem itself states the curves are C¹, and we are to show their ranges can't cover ℝ² countably. So the assumptions are:\n\n- Each curve is C¹.\n- The curves are from ℝ to ℝ².\n\nBut the user is decomposing them into finite intervals. However, the original problem doesn't restrict to finite intervals, but the strategy uses that decomposition. So the actual problem's assumptions are about the curves being C¹ and their ranges. The decomposition into finite intervals is part of the solution approach, not the problem's assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem's assumptions should include only what's given in the problem statement. The problem says \"Show that ℝ² is not a countable union of ranges of C¹ curves.\" The definition of a C¹ curve is given as functions with continuous derivatives.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- Each curve is a function t ↦ (f(t),g(t)) from ℝ to ℝ².\n- For each curve, the derivatives f' and g' exist and are continuous for all t.\n- The problem considers the union of the ranges of countably many such curves.\n\nBut the example given by the user had assumptions listed line by line. For instance, in the example, they had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". That seems incorrect, but perhaps the user intended to list all conditions, even if they are general. Alternatively, maybe the example is incorrect, but I have to follow the instruction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions are the necessary conditions for the problem to hold. For example, in the original problem, to have A(n) divisible by 91, it's necessary that n is an integer, but maybe the user mistakenly added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. But 91 is 7×13, so perhaps the problem requires n to satisfy certain divisibility? The example might be wrong, but regardless, for the current problem, the assumptions should be:\n\n- Each curve is a C¹ function from ℝ to ℝ² (as per the problem's definition).\n- The curves are considered in the union over countably many such curves.\n\nBut the problem as stated doesn't restrict the curves to finite intervals; that's part of the solution approach. However, the problem's conclusion relies on the fact that each curve's range on a finite interval is nowhere dense. Therefore, perhaps the key assumption is that the curves are C¹, and the problem is to show that their ranges can't cover ℝ² when countable.\n\nBut according to the user's example, they included assumptions even if they were part of the problem's general statement. For instance, in the example, the problem says \"for every integer n\", and the formatted problem includes \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So similarly, here, the assumptions would be:\n\n- Each curve is a C¹ curve (i.e., f and g are C¹ functions).\n- The problem considers a countable union of such curves' ranges.\n\nBut the problem statement is to show that ℝ² is not such a union. So the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nEach curve is a C¹ function from ℝ to ℝ²,\nThe derivatives f' and g' exist and are continuous for all t,\nThe problem considers a countable collection of such curves.\n\nProblem:\nShow that ℝ² is not a countable union of ranges of C¹ curves.\n\nBut maybe more precisely, each assumption line addresses one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\nA C¹ curve is a function t ↦ (f(t), g(t)) from ℝ to ℝ²,\nFor each C¹ curve, the derivatives f'(t) and g'(t) exist and are continuous for all t,\nThe problem considers ranges of such C¹ curves.\n\nProblem:\nShow that ℝ² is not a countable union of ranges of C¹ curves.\n\nAlternatively, maybe breaking down the definition:\n\nAssumption:\nEach curve is a function from ℝ to ℝ²,\nEach curve is C¹ (i.e., derivatives exist and are continuous),\nThe union is taken over countably many such curves.\n\nProblem:\nShow that ℝ² cannot be expressed as this countable union.\n\nBut according to the user's example, assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property. So in the example, they had two assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But in the original problem, there was no divisibility condition. So perhaps the user's example is flawed, but regardless, I need to follow the instruction.\n\nGiven that, for the current problem, the key assumptions are the definition of a C¹ curve and that we're considering a countable union. But the problem doesn't add extra conditions beyond the definition. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nA C¹ curve is a function t ↦ (f(t), g(t)) where f' and g' exist and are continuous,\nThe union is over countably many C¹ curves.\n\nProblem:\nShow that ℝ² is not a countable union of ranges of C¹ curves.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement from the book is exactly that. So the assumptions are the properties of the curves as defined. Therefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nEach curve is a C¹ function from ℝ to ℝ²,\nFor each curve, derivatives f' and g' exist and are continuous for all t.\n\nProblem:\nShow that ℝ² is not a countable union of ranges of such C¹ curves.\n\nBut the user's example split the assumptions into separate lines, even if they are part of the same definition. For instance, in the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are separate. Here, the C¹ curve's definition has two parts: function from ℝ to ℝ², and derivatives exist and are continuous. So split those into separate assumptions.\n\nTherefore:\n\nAssumption:\nEach curve is a function from ℝ to ℝ²,\nEach curve is C¹ (i.e., the derivatives f'(t) and g'(t) exist for all t),\nThe derivatives f' and g' are continuous on ℝ.\n\nProblem:\nShow that ℝ² is not a countable union of ranges of such C¹ curves.\n\nAlternatively, since the definition of a C¹ curve is given as having continuous derivatives, maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nA C¹ curve is a function t ↦ (f(t), g(t)) from ℝ to ℝ² with continuous derivatives f' and g'.\n\nProblem:\nShow that ℝ² is not a countable union of ranges of C¹ curves.\n\nBut according to the example, they broke down each condition. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nEach curve is a function from ℝ to ℝ²,\nFor each curve, the derivatives f' and g' exist,\nThe derivatives f' and g' are continuous.\n\nProblem:\nShow that ℝ² is not a countable union of ranges of such curves.\n\nThat way, each line addresses one property. The first line is the domain and codomain, the second existence of derivatives, the third continuity of derivatives.\n\nTherefore, that would be the structured problem.",
