    "Content": "It is known that the diophantine equation $y^{2}=x^{3}-2$ has only one positive integer solution $(x,y)=(3,5)$. The proof of it can be read from the book \"About Indeterminate Equation\" (in Chinese, by Ke Zhao and Sun Qi). But the method I have known of solving this problem is algebraic number theory. My question: Does there exists an elementary method for solving the diophantine equation $y^{2}=x^{3}-2$? I have gotten an elementary method by the assumption that \"$x$\" is a prime. That is, we can get a conclusion from the equation that $3\\mid x$. Since $x$ is a prime we get the only solution $(x,y)=(3,5)$. But if $x$ is not a prime, the answer seems to be difficult. Thank you for your help.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The key is to factor this over $\\mathbf{Z}[\\sqrt{-2}]$ as $(y-\\sqrt{-2})(y+\\sqrt{-2})=x^3$ . Working mod $8$ it is not too hard to see that $x$ and $y$ must be odd, and that $\\gcd((y-\\sqrt{-2}),(y+\\sqrt{-2}))=1$ ; else every divisor would have an even norm, contradiction. Therefore since $\\mathbf{Z}[\\sqrt{-2}]$ is a UFD and since the only units are $\\pm 1$ , each factor must be a cube. Thus we can write $$(y+\\sqrt{-2})=(a+b\\sqrt{-2})^3=(a^3-6ab^2)+(3a^2b-2b^3)\\sqrt{-2}$$ Then, $y=a^3-6ab^2$ and $1=3a^2b-2b^3=b(3a^2-2b^2)$ . From the two equations it is clear that $b=\\pm 1\\implies a=\\pm 1$ , so the only possible solutions are $(x,y)=(3,\\pm 5)$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to help structure this problem from the Math Stack Exchange question. Let me read through the original problem again carefully. The user is asking about solving the Diophantine equation y² = x³ - 2. They mention that the known solution is (3,5) and that the usual proof uses algebraic number theory, but they want to know if there's an elementary method. They tried assuming x is a prime and got that 3 divides x, leading to the solution (3,5), but if x isn't prime, it's harder.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The original problem states that the equation y² = x³ - 2 has only one positive integer solution (3,5). The user tried an elementary method assuming x is prime. So, in their approach, they made an assumption that x is a prime number. But the problem itself, without that assumption, is to solve the equation. However, the user is asking if an elementary method exists, not necessarily under the prime assumption, but their own method used that x is prime.\n\nIn the example provided, assumptions were listed as separate conditions. So here, the key assumption in the user's approach is that x is a prime. But the problem as posed in the title is just solving y² = x³ -2. The user's method only works when x is prime, leading to x=3. However, the actual problem requires considering x not necessarily prime. But the question is asking for an elementary method for the entire equation, not just under the prime assumption. Wait, the user mentions they got a solution assuming x is prime, but the actual problem is to solve the equation without that assumption. The user is asking if there's an elementary method for the general case.\n\nBut the way the problem is structured in the example includes assumptions from the problem. However, in the original problem here, the user is posing the question of solving y² = x³ -2, and in their attempt, they assumed x is prime, but the problem itself doesn't have that assumption. So, in the formatted problem, should the assumption include that x is a prime? Wait, no. Because the problem is to solve the equation in integers, and the user is asking if there's an elementary method. The assumption in the example was given in the problem statement. Wait, in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem given, the user had an assumption in their own approach.\n\nWait, the example given was:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut the formatted problem listed assumptions as n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7; perhaps that was part of the problem's hidden assumptions? Wait, no. Wait, the original problem was to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. Then in the formatted problem, the assumptions were n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But that seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the example, or perhaps it's a different problem. Wait, perhaps the original problem actually required n to be divisible by 7, but the user misstated it? Hmm.\n\nWait, let me check the example again. The original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But 91 is 13*7. So, if n is divisible by 7, then maybe the problem requires that. But the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds that n is divisible by 7. So perhaps there was a miscommunication here. Wait, maybe the original problem was actually to prove that if n is divisible by 7, then A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the example given, the original problem is stated as \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem restricts to n divisible by 7. That might be an error in the example.\n\nBut regardless, following the user's instructions, when structuring the problem, we need to list all assumptions. In the current problem, the user's own approach assumes x is prime. However, the actual problem as posed in the title is \"Solving the diophantine equation y² = x³ -2\", which doesn't have that assumption. The user is asking if there's an elementary method for solving it, given that the known solution is (3,5) and the usual proof uses algebraic number theory. The user's own method assumed x is prime, leading to x=3. So in structuring the problem, should we include the assumption that x is prime? Because the problem as posed in the title doesn't have that assumption. But the user's question is about whether there's an elementary method, not necessarily under the prime assumption.\n\nBut according to the user's example, they took the original problem which was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. Then in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. So, perhaps in that case, the user misrepresented the original problem? Or perhaps the original problem had a hidden assumption. But in the current problem, the user is presenting the problem as \"Solving the diophantine equation y² = x³ -2\", and their own attempt used the assumption that x is prime. However, the actual problem is to solve it in general. So, to structure this according to the given example, perhaps the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumptions:\nx and y are positive integers,\nThe equation y² = x³ - 2 holds.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were more about conditions on the variables. Wait, in the example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the assumptions were n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So in that case, the problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91 under the assumption that n is an integer divisible by 7.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user is asking if there's an elementary method to solve y² = x³ -2, given that the known solution is (3,5) and the usual proof uses algebraic number theory. The user tried an elementary method assuming x is prime, leading to x=3. But the problem as posed is to solve the equation in integers, so the assumptions are that x and y are positive integers satisfying y² = x³ -2. However, the user's approach added an assumption that x is prime. But the formatted problem should present the problem as per the original question, filtering out unrelated information.\n\nSo the original question's problem is: Solve the Diophantine equation y² = x³ -2. The known solution is (3,5). The user wants an elementary method. The user's own method assumed x is prime. So to structure the problem, according to the example, perhaps the assumptions would be that x is a prime, but the problem is to solve the equation. Wait, but the original problem is to solve the equation without that assumption. However, the user mentions that their method works under x being prime. So the problem as posed is general, but the user is asking if an elementary method exists. The structured problem should reflect the original problem, so the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumptions:\nx and y are positive integers,\ny² = x³ -2.\n\nBut the user's approach adds an assumption that x is prime. But the problem is not inherently requiring x to be prime. So perhaps the correct structured problem should list the problem as \"Prove that the only positive integer solution to y² = x³ -2 is (3,5)\" with assumptions being x and y are positive integers. However, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory, unless there was a misstatement in the example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example is incorrect, and the correct way is to list all the conditions given in the problem. In the current problem, the user mentions that the equation has only one positive integer solution (3,5). The problem is to prove that, so the assumptions are x and y are positive integers satisfying y² = x³ -2, and the problem is to show that the only solution is (3,5). But the user's own method assumed x is prime. However, the problem as stated doesn't have that assumption, so perhaps it should not be included. Unless the problem is to solve it under the assumption that x is prime, but the user is asking about the general case.\n\nWait, the user says: \"I have gotten an elementary method by the assumption that 'x' is a prime. That is, we can get a conclusion from the equation that 3 divides x. Since x is a prime we get the only solution (x,y)=(3,5). But if x is not a prime, the answer seems to be difficult.\" So the user is saying that under the assumption that x is prime, they can solve it, but without that assumption, it's hard. So the problem they are posing is to find an elementary method for the general case, i.e., without assuming x is prime. Therefore, the structured problem should not include x being prime as an assumption. Instead, the assumptions are x and y are positive integers, and the equation holds. The problem is to find all solutions. However, the user's own approach added an assumption (x is prime), but the problem itself is more general.\n\nBut the example given by the user includes assumptions that may not be in the original problem. So perhaps in this case, even though the original problem doesn't state that x is prime, since the user's approach uses that assumption, but the problem is to solve it in general, how should we structure it? According to the instructions, we need to \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" So we need to extract the core problem and its assumptions.\n\nThe core problem here is solving the Diophantine equation y² = x³ -2 in positive integers. The known solution is (3,5), and the user is asking if there's an elementary proof. The user mentions their own approach assumed x is prime, leading to x=3. So the problem is to solve y² = x³ -2 in positive integers, without assuming x is prime. Therefore, the assumptions are x and y are positive integers, and y² = x³ -2. The problem is to show that the only solution is (3,5). However, the user's question is whether there's an elementary method for this, but the structured problem should just present the problem, not the request for a method.\n\nWait, the example given was:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut in the original problem, it's for every integer n, so the assumption that n is divisible by 7 contradicts \"for every integer n\". Therefore, this example might have an error, but regardless, following the current user's instructions, when structuring the problem, we need to list all assumptions line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question is about solving y² = x³ -2 in positive integers. The user mentions that the known solution is (3,5), proven via algebraic number theory, and asks if there's an elementary method. They tried assuming x is prime, which works, but struggles otherwise. Therefore, the problem as posed is to solve y² = x³ -2 in positive integers. The assumptions here are:\n\n- x is a positive integer,\n\n- y is a positive integer,\n\n- y² = x³ - 2.\n\nBut since the problem is to find all positive integer solutions, the assumptions are x and y are positive integers satisfying the equation. However, in the example, assumptions were listed as separate conditions. So:\n\nAssumption:\n\nx is a positive integer,\n\ny is a positive integer,\n\nThe equation y² = x³ - 2 holds.\n\nProblem: Find all positive integer solutions (x, y) to the equation y² = x³ - 2.\n\nAlternatively, since the known solution is (3,5), the problem might be to prove that this is the only solution. So:\n\nProblem: Prove that the only positive integer solution to y² = x³ - 2 is (x, y) = (3, 5).\n\nBut the user's question is asking for an elementary method to solve the equation, i.e., to find all solutions. So the structured problem should reflect that.\n\nBut the example given by the user included assumptions that may restrict the problem. For instance, in the example, the original problem was for all integers n, but the formatted problem added n divisible by 7. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Maybe in the original example, the problem actually required n to be divisible by 7, but was misstated. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants the assistant to extract implicit assumptions from the problem statement. However, in the current problem, the user is not stating any implicit assumptions, except in their own approach.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the structured problem should include the assumptions that x and y are positive integers and the equation holds, and the problem is to find all such solutions. But the user's own method adds an assumption that x is prime. However, since the problem is to solve it in general, that assumption is not part of the problem's statement. Therefore, the correct structured problem should not include x being prime as an assumption. The only assumptions are x and y are positive integers satisfying the equation.\n\nBut wait, the user says: \"But if x is not a prime, the answer seems to be difficult.\" So they are saying that when x is prime, it's solvable, but otherwise not. So perhaps the problem is to solve the equation under the assumption that x is prime, but the user's question is whether there's an elementary method for the general case. But the original title of the question is \"Solving the diophantine equation y² = x³ -2\", so the problem is to solve it in general. The user is asking for an elementary method, but the structured problem should just present the problem as per the original question. Therefore, the assumptions are x and y are positive integers, and the equation holds.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a positive integer,\ny is a positive integer,\nThe equation y² = x³ - 2 holds.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the only positive integer solution to the equation y² = x³ - 2 is (x, y) = (3, 5).\n\nBut in the example, assumptions were listed as separate lines, each addressing one property. So each assumption line is one condition. So:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a positive integer,\ny is a positive integer,\ny² = x³ - 2.\n\nProblem:\nFind all positive integer solutions (x, y) to the equation y² = x³ - 2.\n\nAlternatively, since the user already knows the solution is (3,5), the problem is to prove that's the only solution. So:\n\nProblem:\nProve that the only positive integer solution to y² = x³ - 2 is (x, y) = (3, 5).\n\nYes, that makes sense. The user mentions the known solution and asks for an elementary proof. Therefore, the problem is to prove uniqueness of that solution.",
