    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about showing that a specific integral equals α/(2 sin α) when α is an acute angle. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The problem states that α is an acute angle. So the first assumption is that α is acute. But wait, what exactly defines an acute angle here? Probably that α is between 0 and π/2 radians. Maybe I should specify that. But the user's example just mentioned \"n is an integer\" without extra details. So maybe just stating \"α is an acute angle\" is sufficient as the assumption.\n\nLooking at the problem statement again: the integral from 0 to 1 of 1/(x² + 2x cos α +1) dx. The user's example included each assumption line by line, each addressing one property. Here, the key conditions are that α is acute. Are there any other implicit assumptions? For example, the denominator x² + 2x cos α +1 must not be zero in the interval [0,1]. Let's check: the discriminant of the quadratic in x is (2 cos α)^2 - 4*1*1 = 4 cos² α -4 = 4(cos² α -1) = -4 sin² α, which is negative since α is acute (so sin α ≠ 0). Therefore, the denominator is always positive, so the integral is well-defined. But is that an assumption or a consequence? The problem doesn't state it, so maybe it's a consequence rather than an assumption. Therefore, the only assumption needed is that α is an acute angle.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nα is an acute angle.\n\nProblem:\nShow that ∫₀¹ dx/(x² + 2x cos α +1) = α/(2 sin α).\n\nWait, but in the example given by the user, sometimes they split assumptions into separate lines even if they are about the same object. For instance, in the first example, they had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate lines. But in this problem, there's only one assumption about α. So maybe that's all. Let me check again.\n\nThe original problem says \"If α is an acute angle, show that...\" So the main assumption is that α is acute. No other conditions are given. The user's example had multiple assumptions when applicable. Here, only one. So the answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nα is an acute angle.\nProblem:\nShow that $$\\int_0^1 \\frac{dx}{x^2+2x\\cos{\\alpha}+1} = \\frac{\\alpha}{2\\sin{\\alpha}}.$$\n###",
