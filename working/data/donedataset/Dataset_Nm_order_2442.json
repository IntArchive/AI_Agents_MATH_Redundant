    "Content": "The conjugate of a function $f$ is given (for some $y \\in \\operatorname{dom}(f)$ ) as: $$f^*(y) = \\sup_{x \\in \\operatorname{dom}(f)}\\left(y^Tx - f(x)\\right)$$ It is known that $f^*$ is convex even if $f$ is not. I would like to know how to prove this.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "For any given $x \\in \\operatorname{dom} f$ , the function: $$y \\mapsto y^\\top x - f(x)$$ is an affine function, which is convex and lower semicontinuous (and, indeed, continuous). The epigraph of these functions is therefore closed and convex. Then, $f^*$ is the pointwise supremum of the above functions, and its epigraph is the intersection of the above affine functions' epigraphs. Each are closed and convex, proving the epigraph of $f^*$ is closed and convex, thus $f^*$ is convex and lower semicontinuous.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into their specified format. The example they provided involved listing assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object, followed by the problem statement.\n\nThe problem here is about proving that the conjugate of a function is always convex, even if the original function isn't. The conjugate function is defined as f*(y) = sup{yᵀx - f(x)} over x in the domain of f. \n\nFirst, I need to identify all assumptions in the problem. The original question states that the conjugate is given for some y in dom(f), but wait, actually, looking back, the user wrote \"for some y ∈ dom(f)\", but in the standard definition, the domain of f* is the set of y for which the sup is finite, which might not necessarily be the same as dom(f). However, the problem statement here might be slightly misphrased. The standard definition of the conjugate function doesn't restrict y to be in dom(f); instead, y is a vector in the dual space (same dimension as x). So maybe that's an error in the original question. But I need to structure it as per the user's example, which takes the original problem's assumptions as given, even if they might be slightly off. \n\nSo the assumptions here would be:\n\n- f is a function.\n- The conjugate function f* is defined as f*(y) = sup_{x ∈ dom(f)} (y^T x - f(x)).\n- The domain of f is dom(f).\n- y is an element of dom(f). Wait, but in the original problem, it says \"for some y ∈ dom(f)\" when defining f*(y). That seems incorrect because typically y is a dual variable, not necessarily in dom(f). But the user's original problem states it that way, so maybe I should take that as an assumption as given, even if it's not standard. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake, but the task is to structure the problem as presented, not to correct it. \n\nWait, the original question says: \"for some y ∈ dom(f)\" but actually, the conjugate function's domain is the set of y where the sup is finite, which could be different from dom(f). So perhaps the original problem has an error, but the user wants to structure the problem as it's written. So the assumption here would be that y is in dom(f). But in the problem statement, the user is saying \"for some y ∈ dom(f)\", which might be part of the problem's given conditions. Wait, let me check the exact wording:\n\n\"The conjugate of a function f is given (for some y ∈ dom(f)) as: f*(y) = sup_{x ∈ dom(f)} (y^T x - f(x))\"\n\nWait, the wording here is a bit confusing. Usually, the conjugate is defined for y in the dual space, not necessarily in dom(f). But the original problem states that y is in dom(f). So that's part of the problem's assumption. Therefore, the assumption is that y is in dom(f). But actually, the problem is about why f* is convex regardless of f's convexity, so the key assumptions are:\n\n1. f is a function with domain dom(f).\n2. The conjugate f* is defined as the supremum over x in dom(f) of y^T x - f(x) for y in some set (but according to the problem's definition, y is in dom(f)). Wait, the problem says \"for some y ∈ dom(f)\" but the conjugate is usually defined for all y where the sup exists. However, the problem's wording might be that for each y in dom(f), f*(y) is defined as that supremum. But that's a bit non-standard. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has a typo and it should be \"for y ∈ R^n\" or something, but given the problem as written, the user's task is to structure it. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- f is a function with domain dom(f).\n- For y ∈ dom(f), the conjugate function f* is defined as f*(y) = sup_{x ∈ dom(f)} (y^T x - f(x)).\n\nBut the problem is to prove that f* is convex, even if f is not. So perhaps the key assumptions are:\n\n1. f: dom(f) → R, where dom(f) is the domain of f.\n2. The conjugate function f* is defined for y ∈ dom(f) by f*(y) = sup_{x ∈ dom(f)} [y^T x - f(x)].\n\nBut maybe we need to list all individual assumptions. Since each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So breaking it down:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- f is a function.\n- The domain of f is dom(f).\n- For each y in dom(f), f*(y) is defined as the supremum of y^T x - f(x) over x in dom(f).\n\nBut perhaps more precisely:\n\n- f is a function with domain dom(f).\n- f*(y) is defined as sup_{x ∈ dom(f)} (y^T x - f(x)) for y ∈ dom(f).\n\nWait, but the problem says \"for some y ∈ dom(f)\", which might mean that y is an element of dom(f), but in the definition of the conjugate, y can be any vector where the sup exists. However, the problem as stated specifies y ∈ dom(f). So perhaps that's part of the problem's condition. So the assumptions would be:\n\n1. f is a function with domain dom(f).\n2. y is an element of dom(f).\n3. f*(y) is defined as the supremum over x ∈ dom(f) of (y^T x - f(x)).\n\nBut maybe the problem's original wording has a mistake, but the user wants us to follow exactly what's written. So the problem says the conjugate is given for some y ∈ dom(f) as that supremum. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- f is a function.\n- The conjugate function f* is defined for some y ∈ dom(f) by f*(y) = sup_{x ∈ dom(f)} (y^T x - f(x)).\n\nBut perhaps each assumption is a separate point. Let me look at the example given:\n\nIn the example, the assumptions were:\n\n- n is an integer,\n- n is divisible by 7.\n\nSo each assumption is a separate line, each addressing one property of one object.\n\nIn this problem, the objects are f, f*, y, etc. So the assumptions are:\n\n1. f is a function.\n2. The conjugate function f* is defined as f*(y) = sup_{x ∈ dom(f)} (y^T x - f(x)).\n3. y is an element of dom(f).\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the definition is given \"for some y ∈ dom(f)\", which might mean that the conjugate is defined for those y in dom(f). So the domain of f* is dom(f), but typically the domain of f* is the set of y for which the sup is finite, which can be different. However, as per the problem's statement, we take the given assumptions as they are.\n\nSo structuring:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- f is a function.\n- The domain of f is dom(f).\n- For each y ∈ dom(f), f*(y) is defined as sup_{x ∈ dom(f)} (y^T x - f(x)).\n\nBut maybe the problem doesn't specify that the domain of f is dom(f); it's just given as dom(f). So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- f is a function with domain dom(f).\n- The conjugate function f* is defined for y ∈ dom(f) as f*(y) = sup_{x ∈ dom(f)} (y^T x - f(x)).\n\nBut since each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object, perhaps split into:\n\n- f is a function.\n- The domain of f is dom(f).\n- For each y in dom(f), f*(y) is the supremum of y^T x - f(x) over x in dom(f).\n\nBut \"for each y in dom(f)\" is a condition on y, so maybe:\n\n- y is an element of dom(f).\n\nWait, but the problem states that the conjugate is defined for some y in dom(f), not for all. The original question says: \"for some y ∈ dom(f)\" when defining f*(y). Wait, let me check the exact wording again:\n\n\"The conjugate of a function f is given (for some y ∈ dom(f)) as: f*(y) = sup_{x ∈ dom(f)} (y^T x - f(x))\"\n\nAh, the wording here is confusing. The phrase \"for some y ∈ dom(f)\" is parenthetical, which might be a misstatement. Usually, the conjugate is defined for all y where the sup exists, but the problem says \"for some y ∈ dom(f)\", which is likely incorrect. However, the task is to structure the problem as given, not to correct it. So the problem's assumption is that y is in dom(f), so:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- f is a function.\n- The domain of f is dom(f).\n- y is an element of dom(f).\n- The conjugate function f* is defined as f*(y) = sup_{x ∈ dom(f)} (y^T x - f(x)).\n\nBut each assumption must be a single line, one property per line. So breaking down:\n\n1. f is a function.\n2. The domain of f is dom(f).\n3. y is an element of dom(f).\n4. The conjugate function f* is defined as f*(y) = sup_{x ∈ dom(f)} (y^T x - f(x)).\n\nBut perhaps \"y is an element of dom(f)\" is part of the definition of f*, so maybe:\n\n- The conjugate function f* is defined for y ∈ dom(f) as f*(y) = sup_{x ∈ dom(f)} (y^T x - f(x)).\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption is separated. For instance, in the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are two separate lines. So following that, here we have:\n\n1. f is a function.\n2. The conjugate function f* is defined as f*(y) = sup_{x ∈ dom(f)} (y^T x - f(x)).\n3. y is an element of dom(f).\n\nBut the problem states \"for some y ∈ dom(f)\", which may imply that the conjugate is defined for those y in dom(f). So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- f is a function with domain dom(f).\n- The conjugate function f* is defined for some y ∈ dom(f) as f*(y) = sup_{x ∈ dom(f)} (y^T x - f(x)).\n\nBut again, each assumption should be one line, one property. So:\n\n1. f is a function.\n2. The domain of f is dom(f).\n3. y is an element of dom(f).\n4. The conjugate function f* is defined as f*(y) = sup_{x ∈ dom(f)} (y^T x - f(x)).\n\nBut perhaps \"y is an element of dom(f)\" is redundant if the conjugate is defined for y in dom(f). Alternatively, maybe the problem has a misstatement, and y is in the dual space, but given the problem as is, we need to structure it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's only assumption is that f is a function, and the rest is part of the definition of the conjugate. But the example shows that even definitions are broken into assumptions. For instance, in the example, the definition of A(n) is part of the problem statement, not the assumptions. The assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7.\n\nIn this case, the problem's assumptions would be related to the conditions on f and the definition of f*. But the example includes the definition of A(n) in the problem statement, not the assumptions. So perhaps here, the definition of f* is part of the problem statement, and the assumptions are the underlying conditions.\n\nWait, in the example:\n\nOriginal problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, where A(n) is defined as 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n). The formatted problem lists assumptions: n is integer, n divisible by 7, then problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut in the original problem, the user didn't state that n is divisible by 7; that was added as an assumption in the formatted problem. Wait, wait, no. Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n)...\" is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, the assumptions are n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that seems incorrect. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should be n is an integer, and the conclusion is divisibility by 91. But the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which changes the problem. That might be a mistake in the example.\n\nWait, perhaps the example is incorrect. Let me check. The user wrote:\n\nExample:\nOriginal problem:\nProve that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nassumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nproblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nWait, this seems contradictory. The original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, thereby changing the problem to only those n divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Maybe the user intended to include both 7 and 13, since 91=7×13, and perhaps the problem actually requires n to be divisible by both? But in any case, the example provided by the user shows that the formatted problem includes assumptions beyond the original problem's statement. So perhaps the user is expecting to extract implicit assumptions or conditions.\n\nBut given that, perhaps in the current problem, even if the original question has a mistake, we should follow the structure as per the example. So if the original problem says \"for some y ∈ dom(f)\", then that becomes an assumption. However, in the standard definition, the conjugate is defined for y in the dual space, not necessarily in dom(f). But the user's example shows that sometimes assumptions are added beyond the original problem, like adding n divisible by 7 even if the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So perhaps in their example, there was a mistake, but we need to follow the user's format.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example is correct because the original problem had a hidden assumption. For instance, maybe 91 divides A(n) for all integers n, but actually, it's only true when n is divisible by 7, and the example corrected that. But without knowing the context, it's hard to say. However, in the current problem, we need to structure the given question as per the user's example.\n\nBack to the current problem: The question is why the conjugate function f* is always convex, even if f is not. The problem statement defines f* as the supremum over x in dom(f) of y^T x - f(x), for some y ∈ dom(f).\n\nThe key assumptions here are:\n\n1. f is a function with domain dom(f).\n2. The conjugate function f* is defined for y in dom(f) as the supremum of y^T x - f(x) over x in dom(f).\n\nBut to split into individual assumptions per line:\n\n- f is a function.\n- The domain of f is dom(f).\n- For each y in dom(f), f*(y) is defined as the supremum of y^T x - f(x) over x in dom(f).\n\nBut the problem says \"for some y ∈ dom(f)\", which might mean that y is in dom(f), but perhaps in the problem's context, it's for all y in dom(f). The wording is a bit confusing. However, the problem states \"the conjugate of a function f is given (for some y ∈ dom(f)) as...\", which might be a parenthetical clarification, but likely the standard definition where the conjugate is defined for all y where the supremum exists, but the problem may have a typo. Nevertheless, structuring as per the given problem:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- f is a function.\n- The domain of f is dom(f).\n- y is an element of dom(f).\n- The conjugate function f* is defined as f*(y) = sup_{x ∈ dom(f)} (y^T x - f(x)).\n\nBut since each assumption must address only one property or condition applied to one object, we list each as separate lines.\n\nProblem statement: Prove that f* is convex even if f is not.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nf is a function,\nThe domain of f is dom(f),\ny is an element of dom(f),\nThe conjugate function f*(y) is defined as $\\sup_{x \\in \\operatorname{dom}(f)}\\left(y^T x - f(x)\\right)$.\nProblem: \nProve that $f^*$ is convex even if $f$ is not.\n###END_OF_FORMAT###",
