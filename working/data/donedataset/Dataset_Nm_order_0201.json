    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants to prove that for any natural number n, the floor of the sum of square roots from sqrt(n) to sqrt(n+4) equals the floor of sqrt(25n + 49). Or maybe find a counterexample if it's not true. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the problem is saying. The left side is the sum of five consecutive square roots: sqrt(n) + sqrt(n+1) + sqrt(n+2) + sqrt(n+3) + sqrt(n+4). Then they take the floor of that sum. The right side is the floor of sqrt(25n + 49). The claim is that these two floors are equal for any natural number n.\n\nSince the user mentioned they found this relation via a computer, maybe they tested it for several n and it held, but they need a formal proof or a counterexample. My job is to structure the problem correctly according to the specified format. Let me look at the example given to make sure I follow the right structure.\n\nIn the example, the original problem had an expression A(n) and wanted to prove it's divisible by 91. The formatted version listed assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted version, they added \"n is divisible by 7\". So maybe the example is wrong? Wait, no. Wait, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption is n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. So maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Hmm. Wait, no. Wait, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But 91 is 7*13. So perhaps the problem was modified in the formatted version to add the assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. That seems odd. Wait, maybe the example had a typo. Wait, maybe the original problem actually had n being divisible by 7, but the user presented it incorrectly. Hmm. Regardless, I need to focus on the current problem.\n\nFor the current problem, the user wants to structure the problem into Assumption and Problem parts. The original question states \"For any natural number n\", so the assumption should include that n is a natural number. But in the example, they broke down assumptions into one per line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo for this problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is a natural number.\n\nBut since the problem is about equality of two floor functions, maybe there's more implicit assumptions. Wait, the problem is that the floor of the sum of those square roots equals the floor of sqrt(25n +49). So perhaps the key here is to check the relationship between the sum of the square roots and sqrt(25n +49). But are there any other conditions? The original problem says \"for any natural number n\", so n is a positive integer. So the assumption is n is a natural number. Then the problem is to prove or disprove the equality of the two floor functions.\n\nBut in the example, the original problem had an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (like n divisible by 7). Wait, maybe that was a mistake. Wait, let me check again. Original problem in the example: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1 ) -6^n (3^n +2^n ) is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that's conflicting. The original says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\", which restricts n. So maybe that's incorrect. Perhaps the example is not well-structured. Maybe the user made an error in their example. But regardless, for the current problem, I should follow the instructions: list all the assumptions of the problem, each line addressing one property or condition applied to one object. The original problem here says \"for any natural number n\", so the assumption is that n is a natural number. Are there more? The problem doesn't mention any other conditions. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a natural number.\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that $$\\lfloor \\sqrt{n} + \\sqrt{n+1} + \\sqrt{n+2} + \\sqrt{n+3} + \\sqrt{n+4} \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\sqrt{25n + 49} \\rfloor.$$\n\nWait, but in the example, they split the assumptions into two lines even if they were about the same object. For instance, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So in this problem, since n is a natural number, that's one condition. Are there other implicit assumptions? For example, that all square roots are real numbers, but since n is natural, the square roots are defined. So maybe that's already covered. The problem doesn't state any other restrictions. So maybe the assumption is just n is a natural number.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a natural number.\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that $$\\lfloor \\sqrt{n} + \\sqrt{n+1} + \\sqrt{n+2} + \\sqrt{n+3} + \\sqrt{n+4} \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\sqrt{25n + 49} \\rfloor.$$\n\nBut wait, the original question's title is phrased as a yes/no question: \"Is true?\" and the user is asking to show how to prove it or find a counterexample. So the problem is to determine whether the equality holds for all natural numbers n, and either prove it or find a counterexample. Therefore, the problem statement should reflect that. The example given in the user's instruction had \"Prove that...\", but here it's more of a \"Prove or disprove\".\n\nSo the problem part would be: \"Prove or disprove that [expression]\".\n\nThus, the formatted problem is as above. I don't see any other assumptions needed. So I think that's the correct structure.",
