    "Content": "We know that the the general linear group is defined as the set $\\{A\\in M_n(R): \\det A \\neq 0\\}$. I have a homework on how to prove that it is a smooth manifold. So far my only idea is that we can think of each matrix, say $A$, in that group as an $n^2-$dimensional vector. So i guess that every neighborhood of $A$ is homeomorphic to an open ball in $\\mathbb{R}^{n^2}$ (However, i don't know how to prove this.) Now, I'm asking for help if anyone could give me a hint on how to prove that the general linear group is a smooth manifold since I really don't have an idea on how to do this. (By the way, honestly, I don't really understand what a $C^{\\infty}-$smooth structure means which is essential to the definition of a smooth manifold.) Your help will be greatly appreciated. :)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Construct a map $f:M_n(\\mathbb{R}) \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ by taking each matrix to its determinant, where $M_n(\\mathbb{R})$ is the set of all $n \\times n$ matrices. $f^{-1}(\\mathbb{R}\\backslash\\{0\\})=GL_n(\\mathbb{R})$, and $\\mathbb{R}\\backslash\\{0\\}$ is an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}$. Therefore, $GL_n(\\mathbb{R})$ is an open subset of $M_n(\\mathbb{R})$. I'll leave the rest to you.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me read through the original question again carefully.\n\nThe user wants to prove that the general linear group GL(n, R) is a differentiable manifold. They mention that GL(n, R) is defined as the set of n×n real matrices with non-zero determinant. Their idea is to view each matrix as an n²-dimensional vector and consider neighborhoods homeomorphic to open balls in R^{n²}, but they're stuck on proving this and also don't fully understand the smooth structure part.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem is about GL(n, R) being a smooth manifold. The assumptions should be each a single property applied to one object. Let's see:\n\n1. The general linear group GL(n, R) is defined as the set of n×n real matrices with non-zero determinant. So, that's an assumption about GL(n, R).\n\n2. The user mentions thinking of each matrix as an n²-dimensional vector. This implies that GL(n, R) is being considered as a subset of R^{n²}, which is another assumption about the ambient space.\n\n3. The problem requires proving GL(n, R) is a smooth manifold. The user also mentions not understanding the C^∞ smooth structure, which is part of the definition of a smooth manifold.\n\nBut wait, the assumptions should be conditions given in the problem. The problem itself is to prove that GL(n, R) is a smooth manifold. So, the main assumptions are:\n\n- GL(n, R) is the set of invertible n×n real matrices (det ≠ 0).\n\n- The space M_n(R) is identified with R^{n²}, giving it a topology.\n\n- The smooth structure needs to be established, which typically uses the fact that the determinant is a continuous (smooth) function, and GL(n, R) is the preimage of R\\{0} under determinant, hence open.\n\nBut in the original question, the user didn't state these as assumptions; they are part of the problem's context. So perhaps the assumptions are just the definition of GL(n, R) and the context that it's a subset of M_n(R) which is R^{n²}. Let me check the example given.\n\nIn the example, the original problem had the assumption that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. But in the original problem, the user didn't state that n is divisible by 7; the example's formatted version added that assumption. Wait, no, the original problem in the example was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" The formatted version changed it to \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, no, the original problem was \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption added \"n is divisible by 7\". But that's part of the problem's correction? Wait, maybe the example is not perfectly aligned. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption is \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". So perhaps in the example, the user made an error, but perhaps the assistant should extract the assumptions that are actually in the problem. Wait, maybe the example is a bad one. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut that seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", not \"n divisible by 7\". So perhaps the example is wrong. Maybe the assistant should extract only the assumptions given in the problem, not add new ones. Hmm, but the user instruction says \"filter the unrelated information and structure the problem as the following format\". So perhaps the example is an error. Anyway, maybe in the current problem, the assumptions are the definitions given.\n\nSo for the current problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- GL(n, R) is the set of n×n real matrices with non-zero determinant.\n- GL(n, R) is considered as a subset of M_n(R), which is identified with R^{n²}.\n\nProblem: Prove that GL(n, R) is a smooth manifold.\n\nBut the user also mentions not understanding the C^∞ smooth structure, but that's part of what needs to be proven, not an assumption.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user is to structure the problem, listing all assumptions. So the assumptions would be the given conditions in the problem. The problem is to prove GL(n, R) is a smooth manifold, given that it's defined as invertible matrices. So the assumptions are:\n\n1. The general linear group is defined as the set {A ∈ M_n(R) : det A ≠ 0}.\n2. M_n(R) is the space of n×n real matrices.\n3. The topology on M_n(R) is the standard Euclidean topology as R^{n²}.\n\nBut perhaps the key assumptions are:\n\n- Each matrix in GL(n, R) is considered as a point in R^{n²}.\n- The determinant function det: M_n(R) → R is smooth (since we need the preimage of R \\ {0} under det to be open, which is GL(n, R), and open subsets of Euclidean space are smooth manifolds.\n\nBut maybe the problem doesn't state these assumptions explicitly; they are part of the background knowledge. The user's question is about structuring the problem, so the assumptions are what is given in the problem statement. The original problem states: \"the general linear group is defined as {A ∈ M_n(R): det A ≠ 0}. Prove it's a smooth manifold.\" So the assumptions are:\n\n1. GL(n, R) is the set of invertible n×n real matrices.\n2. The topology on GL(n, R) is inherited from M_n(R) identified with R^{n²}.\n\nBut perhaps in the problem statement, the user is taking GL(n, R) as defined with the subspace topology from M_n(R) ≅ R^{n²}, which is an assumption. So the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nGL(n, R) is the set of n×n real matrices with non-zero determinant,\nM_n(R) is identified with R^{n²},\nGL(n, R) is considered with the subspace topology from R^{n²}.\n\nProblem:\nProve that GL(n, R) is a smooth manifold.\n\nBut maybe the key assumptions are just the definition of GL(n, R) and the context of being a subset of R^{n²}. So I think the correct assumptions are:\n\n- The general linear group GL(n, R) is defined as {A ∈ M_n(R) | det A ≠ 0}.\n- The space M_n(R) is identified with R^{n²}.\n\nProblem: Prove that GL(n, R) is a smooth manifold.\n\nThat seems to capture the necessary assumptions from the problem statement. The user didn't mention the topology explicitly, but since they talk about neighborhoods homeomorphic to open balls, it's implied they're using the standard topology on R^{n²}. So I'll list those assumptions.",
