    "Content": "I want to prove the following: If every Sylow subgroup of $G$ is a normal subgroup, then $G$ is isomorphic to the product of its Sylow subgroups. So far, I have gotten to realize that for every prime factor $p_i$ of $|G|$, there is exactly one Sylow subgroup and that these form a partition of $G$. However, I am having trouble finding the isomorphism between $G$ and the product which I will call $G_1 \\times \\ldots \\times G_r$. My idea was just to use the mapping $(g_1, \\ldots, g_r) \\mapsto g_1\\ldots g_r$, which is a bijection, but I don't see whether it is a homomorphism. In general, not all elements of $G_i$ commute with elements of $G_j$, so one cannot simply change the order of the elements in the product.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Recall the following criterion: Criterion. A group $G$ is a direct product if and only if it has two normal subgroups $H,K$ such that $H \\cap K = \\{1\\}$ and $G = HK$. This criterion gives, by induction Criterion bis. A group $G$ is a $n$-fold product if and only if it has $n$ normal subgroups $H_1,\\ldots,H_n$ such that $G = H_1 \\ldots H_n$ and $H_i \\cap (H_1 \\ldots H_{i-1} H_{i+1} \\ldots H_n) = \\{1\\}$. In you case you have the Sylow subgroups $P_1,\\ldots,P_r$ which are normal by hypothesis. The equality $G = P_1 \\ldots P_r$ follows from cardinality considerations, and $P_i \\cap (P_1 \\ldots \\widehat{P_i} \\ldots P_n) = \\{1\\}$ follows from order considerations. Indeed, you can change the order in the product! In fact, let $g \\in G_i$, $h \\in G_j$. Then $g h g^{-1} h^{-1} \\in G_j \\cap G_i$. But $G_j$ is a $p_j$-group and $G_i$ is a $p_i$-group! If an element lies in their intersection, its order must divide both $p_i^n$ and $p_j^m$, hence it is $1$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a math professor who can read a Math Stack Exchange question, filter out unrelated info, and present it with Assumptions and Problem sections.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the example provided. The original problem was about proving that a certain expression is divisible by 91. The formatted version listed assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the user wrote \"for every integer n\", but in the example, the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems contradictory. Maybe the example has a typo? Or perhaps the original problem had a mistake. Hmm. Maybe the example was incorrect. But regardless, I need to follow the structure: list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nNow, the current problem is from Math Stack Exchange titled \"G is the product of its Sylow subgroups\". The user wants to prove that if every Sylow subgroup of G is normal, then G is isomorphic to the product of its Sylow subgroups. The user mentions that they know each Sylow subgroup is unique and normal, forming a partition of G. Their struggle is with constructing the isomorphism, specifically whether the mapping (g1,...,gr) ↦ g1...gr is a homomorphism, considering elements from different Sylow subgroups might not commute.\n\nSo, the key assumptions here would be:\n\n1. G is a finite group (since Sylow theorems apply to finite groups).\n2. For every prime divisor p_i of |G|, the Sylow p_i-subgroup of G is normal.\n3. Each Sylow subgroup is unique (since they are normal, there's only one for each prime).\n4. The Sylow subgroups form a partition of G (their intersection is trivial, and every element is in one of them? Wait, but in a group, Sylow subgroups for different primes intersect trivially, but the group isn't necessarily their product unless they commute. So maybe the partition here refers to the fact that the group is the product of these Sylow subgroups. But the problem is to prove that, so maybe the assumption is that each Sylow subgroup is normal, leading to their product being the group.\n\nWait, the original problem states that the user wants to prove that G is isomorphic to the product of its Sylow subgroups under the condition that every Sylow subgroup is normal. So the main assumptions are:\n\n- G is a finite group.\n- For each prime p dividing the order of G, the Sylow p-subgroup is normal in G.\n\nAdditionally, since Sylow subgroups are unique when they're normal, that's a consequence, but maybe that's part of the given conditions. Wait, the problem states \"every Sylow subgroup of G is a normal subgroup\", which implies that for each prime p dividing |G|, the Sylow p-subgroup is unique (because if a Sylow subgroup is normal, it's the only one for that prime). So the assumptions should include that G is finite, each Sylow subgroup is normal, and maybe that the primes are the ones dividing |G|. But the user might not have stated that G is finite, but Sylow subgroups are defined for finite groups, so that's an implicit assumption.\n\nSo structuring the assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a finite group,\nFor every prime divisor p of |G|, the Sylow p-subgroup of G is normal.\n\nProblem:\nProve that G is isomorphic to the direct product of its Sylow subgroups.\n\nBut wait, the original question's title is \"G is the product of its Sylow subgroups\", and the user wants to show that if every Sylow subgroup is normal, then G is isomorphic to the product. So the key assumptions are that each Sylow subgroup is normal, leading to G being their internal direct product. The problem is to establish the isomorphism, which in this case is the internal direct product, hence the mapping from the external direct product to G via multiplication is an isomorphism.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n1. G is a finite group.\n2. For each prime p dividing the order of G, the Sylow p-subgroup G_p is normal in G.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that G is isomorphic to the direct product of its Sylow subgroups G_1 × G_2 × ... × G_r.\n\nI think that's it. The user's confusion is about whether the multiplication map is a homomorphism, which requires elements from different Sylow subgroups to commute. Since the Sylow subgroups are normal and their orders are pairwise coprime, they should commute elementwise. Wait, but is that automatically true? If H and K are normal subgroups with trivial intersection, and their orders are coprime, then elements of H and K commute. Because for h in H and k in K, the commutator hkh^{-1}k^{-1} is in both H and K, so it's trivial. Therefore, elements from different Sylow subgroups commute, so the product map is a homomorphism. But maybe that's part of the proof the user needs to work out.\n\nSo, in the assumptions, do we need to list that the primes are distinct (which they are by definition of Sylow subgroups), and that the orders are coprime, leading to commuting elements? Or is that part of the proof?\n\nSince the problem is given that all Sylow subgroups are normal, the user needs to show that G is their direct product. The key assumptions are that G is finite, and each Sylow subgroup is normal. The rest (like coprime orders, elements commuting) would be part of the proof, not assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a finite group,\nFor each prime divisor p of |G|, the Sylow p-subgroup of G is normal.\n\nProblem:\nProve that G is isomorphic to the direct product of its Sylow subgroups.\n\nI think that's correct. The user's own problem mentions that they know the Sylow subgroups are unique and form a partition, but that's a consequence of the assumptions, not the assumptions themselves. The assumptions are the given conditions in the problem statement.",
