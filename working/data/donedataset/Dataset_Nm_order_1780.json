    "Content": "In the construction of a good cover for a manifold $M^n$, Bott & Tu use the fact that each point in $M$ is contained in a geodesically convex set (after picking a Riemannian metric). They then claim that the intersection of geodesically convex sets is a geodesically convex set, and that makes sense. They further claim that any geodesically convex set is diffeomorphic to $\\Bbb R^n$. For this, they reference Spivak, who does not actually show the last bit. Perhaps one way to do this is to show that the convex set is star-shaped, so the inverse image of it under the exponential map is convex, and somehow diffeomorphic to a ball, and thus to $\\Bbb R^n$?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "We provide a careful proof of Theorem 5.1 from Bott & Tu. The main body of the proof is taken from this MO post. Let $M^n$ be a smooth manifold. An open cover $\\{U_\\alpha\\}$ is good if each nonempty finite intersection $U_{\\alpha_1}\\cap\\cdots\\cap U_{\\alpha_k}$ is diffeomorphic to $\\Bbb R^n$. The goal here is to prove the following Theorem 1. Every manifold has a good cover. Equip $M$ with a Riemannian metric $g$. An open set $U\\subset M$ is said to be strongly convex if $p,q\\in U$ can be joined by a unique minimizing geodesic contained totally in $U$. Lemma 2. Each point in $M$ is contained in a strongly convex neighborhood. Proof. See do Carmo, Riemannian Geometry , page 76. $\\quad\\Box$ A strongly convex neighborhood $U$ is normal about each point in $p\\in U$, that is, $\\exp_p:T_pM\\to M$ is always a local diffeomorphism. Proposition 3. $\\exp_p^{-1}U$ is star-shaped about $0\\in T_pM$. Proof. $p$ can be connected to any $q\\in U$ by a unique geodesic $\\gamma$. Using normal coordinates, we see that $0$ can be connected to $\\exp_p^{-1}q$ by the straight line $\\exp_p^{-1}\\gamma$.$\\quad\\Box$ The difficult part of this proof lies in the following technical lemma: Lemma 4. Let $\\Omega\\subset\\Bbb R^n$ be open and star-shaped about $0$. Then $\\Omega\\approx \\Bbb R^n$. Proof. The set $F=\\Bbb R^n-\\Omega$ is closed, so me may find a smooth map $\\phi:\\Bbb R^n\\to \\Bbb R_{\\ge0}$ such that $F=\\phi^{-1}(0)$. (See Lee, Introduction to Smooth Manifolds , page 47.) Define $\\lambda:\\Omega\\to\\Bbb R$ by \n$$\\lambda(x)=1+\\left(\\int_0^{||x||}\\frac{\\mathrm d t}{\\phi(t\\hat x)}\\right)^2.$$\nSince $\\phi$ is nonnegative, $\\lambda(t\\hat x)$ is an increasing function of $t$. Clearly $\\lambda$ is smooth. Define a smooth function $f:\\Omega\\to\\Bbb R^n,x\\mapsto \\lambda(x)x$. Let $A(x)=\\sup\\{t>0\\mid t\\hat x\\in\\Omega\\}$. Since $\\lambda$ increases along $t\\hat x$, $f$ maps the segment $[0,A(x))\\hat x$ injectively into $\\Bbb R_{\\ge 0}\\hat x$. Note that $f(0)=0$. We now want to show that $f(\\Omega)=\\Bbb R^n$. We need to investigate the behavior of $f$ close to the boundary of $\\Omega$. Thus, consider the limit \n$$L(x)=\\lim_{r\\to A(x)}||f(r\\hat x)||=\\lambda(A(x))A(x).$$\nIf $A(x)=\\infty$, then $L(x)=\\infty$. The set $[0,A(x))\\hat x$ is bounded if $A(x)<\\infty$, so it contained in some compact set. Then $D\\phi$ is bounded on this compact set, and we may apply Taylor's Theorem with remainder. Namely, since $\\phi(A(x)\\hat x)=0$, we have\n$$\\phi(r\\hat x)=||\\phi(A(x)\\hat x+r\\hat x-A(x)\\hat x)-\\phi(A(x)\\hat x)||\\le M||(r-A(x))\\hat x||=M(A(x)-r),$$\nwhere $M>0$ is some constant. Thus $$\\int_0^{A(x)}\\frac{\\mathrm d t}{\\phi(t\\hat x)}\\ge \\int_0^{A(x)}\\frac{\\mathrm d t}{M(A(x)-t)}=\\infty,$$\nso $L(x)=\\infty$ in this case too. Thus $f$ is surjective. We will show that $f$ has no critical points. Suppose that $Df_x(h)=0$ for some $h,x\\in\\Bbb R^n$. From the definition of $f$, we obtain $Df_x(h)=\\lambda(x)h+D\\lambda_x(h)x=0$. Since $\\lambda(0)=1$, this implies $x\\ne 0$. Thus $h=\\mu x$, for some $\\mu\\ne 0$. This implies $\\lambda(x)+D\\lambda_x(x)=0$. The function $g(t)=\\lambda(tx)$ is increasing, so $g'(1)=D\\lambda_x(x)>0$. This contradicts $D\\lambda_x(x)=-\\lambda(x)\\le -1$. Thus $f$ is regular on $\\Omega$. By the inverse function theorem, $f$ is a local diffeomorphism. A bijective local diffeomorphism is a global diffeomorphism. Thus $f:\\Omega\\to\\Bbb R^n$ is the desired diffeomorphism. $\\quad\\Box$ Any strongly convex neighborhood is diffeomorphic to a star-shaped open set in $T_pM$, thus diffeomorphic to a star-shaped open set in $\\Bbb R^n$, and finally diffeomorphic to $\\Bbb R^n$ itself. Theorem 5. A geodesically convex open set is diffeomorphic to $\\Bbb R^n$. Lemma 6. If $U_1$ and $U_2$ are strongly convex, then so is $U_1\\cap U_2$, assuming it is nonempty. Proof. $U_1\\cap U_2$ is open. Let Let $p,q\\in U_1\\cap U_2$. Let $\\gamma\\subset U_1$ be the geodesic starting at $p$ going to $q$. In $U_1$, set up normal coordinates at $p$, so that $\\gamma$ is a straight line going to $q$. We may also do this in $U_2$, so $\\gamma$ is the geodesic connecting $p$ and $q$ in $U_2$ as well. Thus $\\gamma\\subset U_1\\cap U_2$, and $U_1\\cap U_2$ is geodesically convex.$\\quad\\Box$ Proof of the Theorem. By Lemma 2, we may cover $M$ with geodesically convex open sets. Then each set in the cover is diffeomorphic to $\\Bbb R^n$, and by Lemma 6, each finite nonempty intersection is as well. $\\quad\\Box$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to break this down. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the given problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified structure. The example provided shows that assumptions should list each condition line by line, applied to one object, and then the problem statement. \n\nLooking at the original question: The user is asking why geodesically convex sets are diffeomorphic to ℝⁿ. The context given is from Bott & Tu's work on constructing a good cover using geodesically convex sets. The question mentions that Bott & Tu reference Spivak, who doesn't show the last bit. The user then suggests a possible approach involving star-shaped sets and the exponential map.\n\nFirst, I need to filter out unrelated information. The main problem here is to understand why a geodesically convex set is diffeomorphic to ℝⁿ. The assumptions from the problem would be the conditions given in the question. \n\nThe question states that after picking a Riemannian metric, each point is in a geodesically convex set. The intersection of such sets is also geodesically convex. The key part is the claim that any geodesically convex set is diffeomorphic to ℝⁿ. The user's thoughts about star-shaped sets and the exponential map are part of their reasoning but not part of the original problem's assumptions. \n\nSo, the assumptions should include that we're working on a manifold Mⁿ with a Riemannian metric, that each point is contained in a geodesically convex set, intersections of geodesically convex sets are geodesically convex, and the focus is on a single geodesically convex set. The problem is to prove that such a set is diffeomorphic to ℝⁿ.\n\nWait, but the original problem's exact statement is from Bott & Tu, who claim that any geodesically convex set is diffeomorphic to ℝⁿ. The assumptions in the problem would be the conditions under which this holds. Since the question is about why this is true, the assumptions would be that the set is geodesically convex (in a Riemannian manifold Mⁿ). The problem is to show that such a set is diffeomorphic to ℝⁿ.\n\nSo, the assumptions would be:\n\n- M is a manifold of dimension n.\n- A Riemannian metric is chosen on M.\n- The set in question is geodesically convex.\n\nBut the problem is about any geodesically convex set (in such a manifold). However, the original question mentions that the construction is after picking a Riemannian metric, so perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- M is a smooth manifold of dimension n.\n- M is equipped with a Riemannian metric.\n- The set is geodesically convex.\n\nProblem: Prove that the geodesically convex set is diffeomorphic to ℝⁿ.\n\nBut need to check if there are more specific conditions. The user mentions the intersection property, but that seems to be part of the construction of a good cover, not directly part of the problem's assumptions. The key point is the diffeomorphism to ℝⁿ. So the main assumptions are the existence of a Riemannian metric and that the set is geodesically convex. So, I think the formatted problem should list those as the assumptions, each on a separate line.",
