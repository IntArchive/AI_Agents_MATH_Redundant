    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem from Loney's book. The series given is 1 + 2/3! + 3/5! + 4/7! + ... and we need to show it equals e/2. Hmm, first, I need to recall the series expansions I know. The obvious one is e^x, which is the sum of x^n / n! from n=0 to infinity. But here, the denominators are factorials of odd numbers: 1 is 1!, then 3!, 5!, etc., and the numerators are increasing integers. So maybe there's a way to relate this series to the expansion of e^x, but perhaps split into even and odd terms?\n\nLet me write the general term of the series. The k-th term seems to be (k+1)/( (2k+1)! ), starting from k=0: when k=0, term is 1/1! = 1; k=1, term is 2/3!; k=2, 3/5!; etc. Wait, actually, if we index starting at n=1, the first term is 1 (which is 1/1!), then n=2 gives 2/3!, n=3 gives 3/5!, etc. So maybe the general term for n ≥ 1 is n / ( (2n - 1)! ). Let me check: for n=1, 1/(1!)=1; n=2, 2/3!; yes, that works. So the series is sum_{n=1}^∞ n / (2n - 1)!.\n\nNow, how to sum this? One approach is to relate it to known series. Let's think about the series for e. The standard e^x is sum_{k=0}^∞ x^k /k!. If we consider e^1, that's sum 1/k! from k=0 to ∞. But here, denominators are factorials of odd numbers. Maybe split e into even and odd terms? Recall that e = sum_{k=0}^∞ 1/k! = sum_{m=0}^∞ 1/(2m)! + sum_{m=0}^∞ 1/(2m+1)!), separating even and odd factorials. But how does that help here?\n\nAlternatively, notice that the numerator n in each term could be linked to a derivative. For example, the derivative of x^{2n} would be 2n x^{2n -1}, but I'm not sure. Wait, let's see. If I have a term like n / (2n -1)! , maybe express it as n / (2n -1)! = [ (2n) / (2n)! ] * something. Hmm, n/(2n -1)! = (2n)/(2 * (2n)!)) ). Wait, let's see: 2n * (2n -1)! = (2n)! So, n/(2n -1)! = (2n)/(2 * (2n)! ) ). So n/(2n -1)! = (1/2) * 2n / (2n)! ) = (1/2) * [1/(2n -1)! ) ]. Wait, maybe that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, consider generating functions. Let's suppose the sum S = sum_{n=1}^∞ n / (2n -1)! ). Let me write this as sum_{n=1}^∞ n / (2n -1)! ). Let me make a substitution: let k = 2n -1, so when n=1, k=1; n=2, k=3; n=3, k=5; etc. Then n = (k +1)/2. So S = sum_{k=1,3,5,...} ((k +1)/2) / k! ). That's the same as sum_{k=0}^∞ ((2k +1 +1)/2) / (2k +1)! ) = sum_{k=0}^∞ (2k + 2)/ (2*(2k +1)! )) = sum_{k=0}^∞ (k +1)/( (2k +1)! ). Hmm, but this seems to bring us back to the original series. Maybe another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps split the numerator. The term n/(2n -1)! can be written as [ (2n -1) +1 ] / (2n -1)! ) * 1/2. Let's check: (2n -1 +1)/ (2n -1)! ) *1/2 = 2n / (2n -1)! ) *1/2 = n / (2n -1)! ), which matches. So n/(2n -1)! ) = [ (2n -1)/ (2n -1)! ) + 1/(2n -1)! ) ] *1/2 = [ 1/(2n -2)! ) + 1/(2n -1)! ) ] *1/2. Wait, because (2n -1)/ (2n -1)! ) = 1/(2n -2)! ), since (2n -1)! = (2n -1)(2n -2)!.\n\nTherefore, n/(2n -1)! ) = [1/(2n -2)! ) + 1/(2n -1)! ) ] *1/2.\n\nSo substituting back into the series S, we have S = sum_{n=1}^∞ [1/(2n -2)! + 1/(2n -1)! ) ] *1/2. Then split the sum into two parts:\n\nS = (1/2) [ sum_{n=1}^∞ 1/(2n -2)! + sum_{n=1}^∞ 1/(2n -1)! ) ].\n\nNow, let's adjust the indices. For the first sum, let k = 2n -2. When n=1, k=0; n=2, k=2; n=3, k=4; etc. So sum_{n=1}^∞ 1/(2n -2)! = sum_{k=0}^∞ 1/(2k)! ). Similarly, the second sum is sum_{n=1}^∞ 1/(2n -1)! ), which for k = 2n -1, when n=1, k=1; n=2, k=3; etc., so that's sum_{k=1,3,5,...} 1/k! = sum_{k=0}^∞ 1/(2k +1)! ).\n\nTherefore, S = (1/2) [ sum_{k=0}^∞ 1/(2k)! ) + sum_{k=0}^∞ 1/(2k +1)! ) ].\n\nBut wait, sum_{k=0}^∞ 1/(2k)! ) is the sum of even terms of e, which is (e + e^{-1}) / 2, since cosh(1) = (e + e^{-1})/2 = sum_{k=0}^∞ 1/(2k)! ). Similarly, sum_{k=0}^∞ 1/(2k +1)! ) is the sum of odd terms of e, which is (e - e^{-1}) / 2 = sinh(1).\n\nTherefore, substituting these into S:\n\nS = (1/2) [ (e + e^{-1})/2 + (e - e^{-1})/2 ] = (1/2) [ ( (e + e^{-1}) + (e - e^{-1}) ) / 2 ] = (1/2)( (2e)/2 ) = (1/2)(e) = e/2.\n\nHence, the series sums to e/2. So that's the proof.",
