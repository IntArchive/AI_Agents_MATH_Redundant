    "AcceptedAnswer": "We have to show the set $S = \\{A \\in \\mathbb{C}^{m \\times n} : \\texttt{rank}(A) > r \\} \\tag{1}$ is open for all real $r.$ We need the following fact : given a matrix $A_0 = (a_{ij}^{0})$ of rank $r_0$ there is a $\\delta > 0$ such that for any  matrix $A=(a_{ij})$ with $\\|A - A_0\\|_{\\texttt{max}} < \\delta$ (i,e., $ |a_{ij} - a^0_{ij}| < \\delta\\  \\forall i,j$) we have $\\texttt{rank}(A) \\geq r_0.$ The proof of this is straightforward, if $r_0 = 0$ the result is immediate, if $r_0 > 0$ there is a $r_0 \\times r_0$ non-singular submatrix in $A_0$, call this submatrix $A^{r_0}_0$. We have $\\texttt{det}(A_0^{r^0}) \\neq 0.$ By continuity of determinant there is a $\\delta > 0$ such that for any $r_0 \\times r_0$ matrix $B$ with $\\|A_0^{r^0} - B\\|_{\\texttt{max}} < \\delta$ we have $\\texttt{det}(B) \\neq 0.$ So if $A$ is any matrix with $\\|A - A_0\\|_{\\texttt{max}} < \\delta$ and $A^{r^0}$ is the submatrix of $A$ with the same indices that determine $A_0^{r^0}$ then $\\|A^{r^0} - A_0^{r^0}\\|_{\\texttt{max}} \\leq \\|A-A_0\\|_{\\texttt{max}} < \\delta$ which implies $\\texttt{det}(A^{r^0}) \\neq 0$ so $\\texttt{rank}(A) \\geq r_0.$ Now we can easily prove $(1)$.  If $S$ is non-empty choose $A_0 \\in S$ we have $\\texttt{rank}(A_0) > r$. We can find $\\delta > 0$ such that for any $A$ with $\\|A-A_0\\|_{\\texttt{max}} < \\delta$ we have  $\\texttt{rank}(A) \\geq \\texttt{rank}(A_0) > r$, so $A \\in S$ and $S$ is open. It is easy to see rank is not a continuous function : each element in the sequence of matrices $\\begin{pmatrix} \\dfrac{1}{n} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\dfrac{1}{n} \\end{pmatrix}$ has rank 2, but the limit has rank 0.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure a problem from Math Stack Exchange into their specified format. The example they gave involved listing assumptions line by line, each about one property or condition on one object. Then the problem statement.\n\nThe original question here is about proving that the rank of a matrix is a lower semi-continuous function but not continuous everywhere. The user provided the title and the question content. Let me parse this.\n\nFirst, the problem statement: \"Prove that rank(A) is not continuous everywhere but is lower semi-continuous everywhere, where A ∈ ℂ^{n×m}.\"\n\nNow, I need to list the assumptions. The assumptions should be each a single condition on one object. Let's break down the problem. The matrix A is in the space of complex matrices with dimensions n×m. So one assumption is that A is an element of ℂ^{n×m}. But wait, the problem is about the function that maps A to its rank. So the function's domain is the space of n×m complex matrices. The other assumptions might relate to the properties of lower semi-continuity and the rank function. However, in the example given, the assumptions were about the variables in the problem. Here, the main object is the matrix A. The problem is about the rank function's continuity properties. \n\nBut the assumptions in the example were about the variable n. In this case, the variable here is the matrix A. So perhaps the key assumptions are the space in which A resides. So maybe:\n\nAssumption: A is a matrix in ℂ^{n×m},\nBut wait, the problem states \"where A ∈ ℂ^{n×m}\" so that's an assumption. Are there other implicit assumptions? The problem doesn't specify any particular conditions on n and m, so maybe they are arbitrary positive integers. But in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. However, in the user's example, the formatted problem included the divisibility by 7 even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So maybe in that case, the user wanted to split assumptions into each property. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, the expression is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem listed the assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect because the original problem didn't require n to be divisible by 7. Wait, maybe the example provided by the user is actually wrong. Let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal problem example: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should just be n is an integer. But the formatted one added n is divisible by 7, which was not in the original. That seems like an error. Maybe the example was incorrect, but the user provided it as their own example. So perhaps the user wants assumptions to be all the given conditions in the problem, even if they are not explicitly stated. Hmm, maybe in that example, the original problem actually had a hidden assumption that n is divisible by 7, but I'm not sure. Wait, 91 is 7*13. Maybe the problem in the example required n to be such that 7 divides the expression, but the user split it into n being an integer and n being divisible by 7. But if the original problem states \"for every integer n\", then the assumption that n is divisible by 7 would be incorrect. So perhaps the example provided by the user is incorrect. But regardless, the task is to follow their format.\n\nIn this current problem, the problem is about rank being lower semi-continuous everywhere but not continuous. The key components are:\n\n- The matrix A is in ℂ^{n×m}. So that's an assumption.\n- The function in question is rank(A), which is a function from the space of matrices to integers.\n- The problem is about the continuity properties of this function.\n\nBut in terms of assumptions, the main ones are the domain of A. So the assumption would be A is an element of ℂ^{n×m}. However, the problem doesn't specify any restrictions on n and m. So maybe:\n\nAssumption: A ∈ ℂ^{n×m}\n\nProblem: Prove that rank(A) is not continuous everywhere but is lower semi-continuous everywhere.\n\nWait, but in the example, the user included an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) which wasn't in the original problem. That suggests that maybe the user is expecting to break down all possible conditions. But in the current problem, the original problem doesn't state any additional conditions. So perhaps the only assumption is that A is in the space of n×m complex matrices.\n\nBut maybe also, the problem is over the space of matrices with the usual topology, since continuity is a topological concept. So perhaps an assumption is that ℂ^{n×m} is endowed with the standard topology (like the Euclidean topology). But the original problem doesn't specify that, but in mathematical contexts, when talking about continuity of matrix rank, we usually assume the standard topology. However, the user's example didn't include such an assumption. So maybe the user only wants to list explicit assumptions from the problem statement.\n\nIn the original problem statement: \"Prove that rank(A) is not continuous everywhere but is lower semi-continuous everywhere, where A ∈ ℂ^{n×m}.\" So the only explicit condition is that A is in ℂ^{n×m}. So the assumption is \"A is a matrix in ℂ^{n×m}\".\n\nTherefore, following the example (even if the example had an error), we should list each assumption on one line. But in this case, there's only one assumption. Unless we need to break down \"A is a matrix in ℂ^{n×m}\" into two parts: A is a matrix, and A has dimensions n×m with complex entries. But according to the example, the user wrote \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. So maybe each atomic condition. So \"A is an element of ℂ^{n×m}\" is a single assumption.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nA is an element of ℂ^{n×m}\nProblem:\nProve that rank(A) is not continuous everywhere but is lower semi-continuous everywhere.\n\nWait, but the problem is about the function rank being lower semi-continuous everywhere, which is a property of the function over the entire space. So the only assumption is the space where A lives. That seems to be it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has another implicit assumption, such as considering the rank function as a function from the space of matrices to integers, with the appropriate topology. But unless specified, perhaps the user just wants the explicit assumptions from the problem statement. So in the original question, the user wrote \"where A ∈ ℂ^{n×m}\". So that's the only assumption.\n\nHence, the formatted problem should have one assumption line: \"A is an element of ℂ^{n×m}\".",
