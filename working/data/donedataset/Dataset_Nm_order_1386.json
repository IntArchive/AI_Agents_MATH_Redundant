    "Content": "I am trying to show that if $f$ is convex in $(a,b)$ it is Lipschitz in $[c,d]$ where $a \\lt c \\lt d \\lt b$. Here's what I have so far: Let $t_1,t_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $a \\lt t_2 \\lt c \\lt d \\lt t_1 \\lt b$\n and let $x_1,x_2 \\in [c,d]$. Because $f$ is convex I know that\n$$\\dfrac{f(c)-f(t_2)}{c-t_2} \\lt \\dfrac{f(x_2)-f(x_1)}{x_2-x_1} \\lt \\dfrac{f(t_1)-f(d)}{t_1-d}$$ I think I'm almost there, but what is the right $C$?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that a convex function on an interval (a, b) is Lipschitz on any closed subinterval [c, d] where a < c < d < b. The original question mentions using points t1 and t2 outside [c, d] to establish bounds on the difference quotient.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions properly. The key assumptions here are:\n\n1. The function f is convex on the open interval (a, b). That's a fundamental assumption because convexity gives us certain properties about the function's slopes.\n2. The interval [c, d] is a closed subinterval of (a, b), which means a < c < d < b. This is important because the Lipschitz condition is local, so we need to work within a compact subset inside the domain where f is convex.\n3. The user has introduced points t1 and t2 such that a < t2 < c < d < t1 < b. These points are outside [c, d] but still within (a, b), which allows them to use the convexity to bound the slopes on [c, d].\n\nThe problem statement, after filtering out the user's thought process, is to prove that f is Lipschitz on [c, d]. The user is asking for the correct Lipschitz constant C. \n\nLooking at the inequalities they provided from convexity, the difference quotient (f(x2) - f(x1))/(x2 - x1) is bounded between the slopes from t2 to c and from d to t1. So the maximum of the absolute values of these two slopes should give the Lipschitz constant C. \n\nBut to structure this properly, the assumptions should include each condition separately. For example, the convexity of f on (a, b) is one assumption. The specific positioning of t2 and t1 relative to [c, d] is another. However, in the problem statement, the user might not need to list t1 and t2 as assumptions because they are part of the proof strategy rather than given conditions. The main assumptions are the convexity and the interval [c, d] being inside (a, b). \n\nWait, the problem statement as presented in the example doesn't include all steps the user took, just the core assumptions and the problem. So in this case, the key assumptions are:\n\n- f is convex on (a, b).\n- The interval [c, d] satisfies a < c < d < b.\n\nThe problem is to prove that f is Lipschitz on [c, d]. The user's attempt involves using points t2 and t1 outside [c, d] to bound the difference quotient. But in the formatted problem, we should only include the given assumptions, not the user's steps. So the points t1 and t2 are part of the user's approach, not the problem's assumptions. Therefore, the assumptions are the two points above.\n\nWait, but in the example given by the user, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem, the user wrote \"for every integer n\", so maybe the example was incorrect. Wait, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem included an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems conflicting. Maybe the example had a mistake. Hmm.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user is trying to structure their problem. The original problem is to show that a convex function on (a,b) is Lipschitz on [c,d], with a < c < d < b. The user's attempt involves introducing t1 and t2. But in the formatted problem, the assumptions should only include what is given in the problem, not the user's steps. So the main assumptions are:\n\n1. f is convex on (a, b).\n2. [c, d] is a closed interval with a < c < d < b.\n\nThe problem is to prove that f is Lipschitz on [c, d].\n\nBut the user's original problem statement includes their attempt where they mention t1 and t2. However, the task is to filter out unrelated information. The actual problem as posed is to show that f being convex on (a, b) implies it is Lipschitz on [c, d]. The user's specific approach with t1 and t2 is part of their attempt, not part of the problem's assumptions.\n\nTherefore, in the formatted problem, the assumptions should list that f is convex on (a, b) and that [c, d] is a closed subinterval of (a, b). The problem is to prove f is Lipschitz on [c, d].\n\nBut wait, the original problem's title is \"Proving that a convex function is locally Lipschitz\", and the problem statement is \"if f is convex in (a,b) it is Lipschitz in [c,d] where a < c < d < b\". So the key assumptions are f is convex on (a, b), and [c,d] is a closed subinterval of (a,b). The problem is to prove Lipschitz on [c,d].\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumptions:\n- f is a convex function on the interval (a, b).\n- [c, d] is a closed interval such that a < c < d < b.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f is Lipschitz continuous on [c, d].\n\nBut the user's own attempt mentions t1 and t2. However, in the example given, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem in the example included an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like maybe the example is incorrect because the original problem didn't state that n must be divisible by 7. But the user's example might have had a typo. Anyway, following the user's example, they listed the assumptions as \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", but the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which might imply that the formatted problem's assumptions were incorrect. Perhaps the example was a mistake, but we have to follow the structure as per the user's example.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. So maybe the example is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem had a typo. But regardless, for the current problem, the user is to structure the problem as per the given example.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's original question states that f is convex on (a,b), and the problem is to show it's Lipschitz on [c,d] where a < c < d < b. The user's attempt involves choosing t1 and t2 outside [c,d]. However, in the formatted problem, assumptions should be the given conditions, not the steps in the proof. Therefore, the key assumptions are:\n\n- f is convex on (a, b).\n- [c, d] is a closed interval with a < c < d < b.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would list these assumptions and then the problem statement to prove Lipschitz continuity on [c, d].\n\nHowever, in the example provided, the assumptions included specific properties applied to one object each. So here, each assumption is a separate line, each applying to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nf is convex on the interval (a, b),\n[c, d] is a closed interval,\na < c < d < b.\n\nBut wait, \"a < c < d < b\" is a condition on the intervals, so perhaps that's another assumption. But the problem says \"where a < c < d < b\", so the assumptions would be:\n\n- f is convex on (a, b).\n- [c, d] is a closed interval such that a < c < d < b.\n\nBut according to the example's structure, each assumption addresses only one property or condition applied to one object. So breaking it down:\n\n1. f is a function defined on the interval (a, b).\n2. f is convex on (a, b).\n3. [c, d] is a closed interval.\n4. The inequalities a < c < d < b hold.\n\nBut maybe that's over-splitting. The original example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as two separate assumptions, even though both apply to n. Similarly, here, the main assumptions are that f is convex on (a, b) and [c, d] is a closed subinterval of (a, b) (i.e., a < c < d < b). So each can be a separate assumption line.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is convex on the interval (a, b),\n[c, d] is a closed interval,\na < c < d < b.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f is Lipschitz continuous on [c, d].\n\nBut perhaps \"a < c < d < b\" is part of the same assumption about the interval [c, d]. Alternatively, it could be written as:\n\nAssumption:\nf is convex on the interval (a, b),\n[c, d] is a closed subinterval of (a, b).\n\nBut to adhere strictly to the example where each line is a single condition on one object, maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nf is convex on the interval (a, b),\n[c, d] is a closed interval,\nThe endpoints of [c, d] satisfy a < c < d < b.\n\nBut I think the key is to split into separate lines each addressing one condition. So the answer would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nf is a convex function on the interval $(a, b)$,\n$[c, d]$ is a closed interval,\n$a < c < d < b$.\nProblem:\nProve that $f$ is Lipschitz continuous on $[c, d]$.\n###",
