    "Content": "I am looking for the \"best\" way to determine whether a function is one-to-one, either algebraically or with calculus. I know a common, yet arguably unreliable method for determining this answer would be to graph the function. However, this can prove to be a risky method for finding such an answer at it heavily depends on the precision of your graphing calculator, your zoom, etc... What is the best method for finding that a function is one-to-one? In your description, could you please elaborate by showing that it can prove the following: $\\frac{x-3}{x+2}$ is one-to-one. $\\frac{x-3}{x^3}$ is not one-to-one.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "To show that $f$ is 1-1, you could show that $$f(x)=f(y)\\Longrightarrow x=y.$$ So, for example, for $f(x)={x-3\\over x+2}$ : Suppose ${x-3\\over x+2}= {y-3\\over y+2}$ . Then: \\begin{align*}\n&{x-3\\over x+2}= {y-3\\over y+2}  \\\\\n\\Longrightarrow& (y+2)(x-3)= (y-3)(x+2)\\\\\n\\iff& yx+2x-3y-6= yx-3x+2y-6\\\\\n\\iff&2x-3y =-3x+2y\\\\\n\\iff&2x+3x =2y+3y\\\\\n\\iff&5x =5y\\\\\n\\iff&x=y\n\\end{align*} So $f(x)={x-3\\over x+2}$ is 1-1. I'll leave showing that $f(x)={{x-3}\\over 3}$ is 1-1 for you. Alternatively, to show that $f$ is 1-1, you could show that $$x\\ne y\\Longrightarrow f(x)\\ne f(y).$$ Or, for a differentiable $f$ whose derivative is either always positive or always negative, you can conclude $f$ is 1-1 (you could also conclude that $f$ is 1-1 for certain functions whose derivatives do have zeros; you'd have to insure that the derivative never switches sign and that $f$ is constant on no interval). You would discover that a function $g$ is not 1-1, if, when using the first method above, you find that the equation is satisfied for some $x\\ne y$ . For example, take $g(x)=1-x^2$ . Then $$\n\\eqalign{\n&g(x)=g(y)\\cr\n\\iff&{1-x^2}= {1-y^2}  \\cr\n\\iff&-x^2= -y^2\\cr\n\\iff&x^2=y^2\\cr}\n$$ The above equation has $x=1$ , $y=-1$ as a solution.  So, there is $x\\ne y$ with $g(x)=g(y)$ ; thus $g(x)=1-x^2$ is not 1-1. Of course, to show $g$ is not 1-1, you need only find two distinct values of the input value $x$ that give $g$ the same output value. Although you rightfully point out that the graphical method is unreliable; it is still instructive to consider the methods used and why they work: Graphically, you can use either of the following: Use the \"Horizontal Line Test\": $f$ is 1-1 if and only if every horizontal line intersects the graph\nof $f$ in at most one point.  Note that this is just the graphical\ninterpretation of \"if $x\\ne y$ then $f(x)\\ne f(y)$ \"; since the\nintersection points of a horizontal line with the graph of $f$ give $x$ values for which $f(x)$ has the same value (namely the $y$ -intercept of the line). Use the fact that a continuous $f$ is 1-1 if and only if $f$ is either\nstrictly increasing or strictly decreasing. This, of course, is the case if $f$ is differentiable and the derivative is always positive or always negative (with perhaps being zero at \"isolated\" points).\n(Note this method  applies to only the green function below.)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the user's format. First, I need to read through the original question on Math Stack Exchange and filter out the unrelated information. The user is asking about the best methods to determine if a function is one-to-one, both algebraically and using calculus. They provided two examples: showing that (x-3)/(x+2) is one-to-one and (x-3)/(x^3) is not. \n\nThe example given by the user for the previous problem had assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. In that example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is about functions being one-to-one. \n\nSo, what are the assumptions here? The user mentions two functions: f(x) = (x-3)/(x+2) and g(x) = (x-3)/(x^3). The problem is to determine if each is one-to-one. But in the original question, the user is asking for the general method and then applying it to these two examples. However, the user wants the formatted problem to include the specific functions as part of the problem statement. \n\nWait, the example given by the user in their initial prompt had the assumptions listed as properties of the objects in the problem. In the original problem about A(n), the assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. For the current problem, the functions are given, so maybe the assumptions are about the functions' domains? For example, for f(x) = (x-3)/(x+2), the domain is all real numbers except x = -2. Similarly, for g(x) = (x-3)/x³, the domain is all real numbers except x = 0. But does the problem require these as assumptions, or are they part of the problem's given conditions?\n\nLooking back at the example, the assumptions were about the variable n. In this case, the problem is to determine if the functions are one-to-one. The functions are defined with their respective domains, but the user didn't specify the domains explicitly. However, to determine if a function is one-to-one, the domain is crucial. So maybe the assumptions should include the domains of the functions. But the original question doesn't mention domains, so perhaps the user expects that the default domains (the largest possible domains where the functions are defined) are assumed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no specific assumptions beyond the functions themselves, and the problem is to determine injectivity. Since the original question is asking for methods to prove a function is one-to-one, the problem part would be to show that (x-3)/(x+2) is one-to-one and (x-3)/(x³) is not. So the assumptions would be the definitions of the functions. But each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nWait, perhaps the functions themselves are the objects, and their definitions are the assumptions. So for each function, the assumption is their respective formula. But in the example provided, each assumption was a separate line. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) = (x - 3)/(x + 2),\ng(x) = (x - 3)/x³.\n\nProblem:\nDetermine if f(x) is one-to-one and g(x) is not one-to-one.\n\nBut the original problem in the user's example included the divisibility condition as an assumption. Here, the functions are given, so their definitions are the assumptions. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to show the injectivity of these functions without additional assumptions beyond their definitions. But the user might want the problem section to encapsulate both parts. Let me check the original question again.\n\nOriginal question: The user wants to know the best method to determine if a function is one-to-one, with examples given. The formatted problem should extract the problem part as \"Prove that (x-3)/(x+2) is one-to-one\" and \"Prove that (x-3)/(x³) is not one-to-one\". But according to the user's example, the problem part is a single statement. However, in this case, there are two separate tasks. But the user's example had the problem part as a single problem. Maybe the problem here is structured as two separate problems, but the user's format example has one problem. Alternatively, the problem can be written as two bullet points under the problem section.\n\nWait, the user's example for the original problem had the problem as \"Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" So the problem is a single statement. In the current case, the user is asking for two things: show that one function is one-to-one and another is not. So perhaps the problem statement is: \"Determine whether the following functions are one-to-one: a) f(x) = (x-3)/(x+2); b) g(x) = (x-3)/x³.\" But the original question says \"could you please elaborate by showing that it can prove the following: [function] is one-to-one. [another function] is not one-to-one.\" So the problem is to prove both statements. Therefore, the problem part should include both.\n\nBut the user's format requires the problem to be a single statement. Maybe it's acceptable to have two parts in the problem. Alternatively, if the user's example had a single problem, maybe we need to split into two separate problems. However, the user's instruction says to structure the problem as per the format, which in the example had a single problem. So perhaps in this case, the problem is to \"Prove that the function f(x) = (x-3)/(x+2) is one-to-one and the function g(x) = (x-3)/x³ is not one-to-one.\"\n\nBut how to list assumptions? The assumptions would be the definitions of the functions. So each function is defined as per their formula. Therefore, each function is an object with its own definition. So:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) = (x - 3)/(x + 2),\ng(x) = (x - 3)/x³.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f(x) is one-to-one and g(x) is not one-to-one.\n\nBut in the user's example, the assumptions were about the variable n. Here, the assumptions are about the functions f and g. Each function is an object, so each definition is a separate assumption. So that would fit the format.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) = (x - 3)/(x + 2),\ng(x) = (x - 3)/x³.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f(x) is one-to-one and g(x) is not one-to-one.\n\nAlternatively, if the user intended each function's domain to be an assumption, but the original question doesn't mention domains, so maybe the domains are implied by the functions. Since f(x) is undefined at x = -2 and g(x) at x = 0, those are part of their definitions. Therefore, the assumptions would include the domains. But since the user's example didn't specify the domain for n beyond it being an integer divisible by 7, perhaps here the functions' definitions are sufficient as assumptions.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct formatted problem is as above. Let me check the example again. The original example had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. So each assumption is a separate line. Here, each function definition is a separate assumption. Therefore, the answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nf(x) = (x - 3)/(x + 2),\ng(x) = (x - 3)/x³.\nProblem:\nProve that f(x) is one-to-one and g(x) is not one-to-one.\n### \n\nYes, that seems to fit. Each function is an object with its own definition as an assumption. The problem is to prove the injectivity of each accordingly.",
