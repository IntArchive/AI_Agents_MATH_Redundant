    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The original question is about proving that a projection operator is self-adjoint if and only if the kernel and image are orthogonal complements. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question carefully. The problem states: Let V be an inner product space (IPS), and π: V → V is a projection such that V = U ⊕ W, where U is the kernel of π and W is the image. Then, for any v = u + w (u ∈ U, w ∈ W), π(v) = w. We need to prove that π is self-adjoint if and only if U and W are orthogonal complements.\n\nNow, following the example provided, I need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let's identify the assumptions:\n\n1. V is an inner product space (IPS). This is given right at the start.\n2. π is a projection from V to V. The problem states \"π : V → V is a projection.\"\n3. V is decomposed as the direct sum U ⊕ W, meaning V = U + W and U ∩ W = {0}. The question mentions this explicitly.\n4. U is the kernel of π (U = ker(π)).\n5. W is the image of π (W = im(π)).\n6. For any v in V, written as v = u + w with u ∈ U and w ∈ W, π(v) = w. This defines how the projection acts on elements of V.\n\nThese are all the conditions given in the problem. The problem then asks to prove the equivalence: π is self-adjoint if and only if U and W are orthogonal complements. \n\nWait, the original problem says \"orthogonal complements,\" but in the direct sum decomposition, U and W are already complements (since it's a direct sum). The key here is that they need to be orthogonal, meaning U = W⊥ and W = U⊥. So the condition is that U and W are orthogonal subspaces, not just any complements.\n\nSo the assumptions are all the listed points above, and the problem is to prove the equivalence between π being self-adjoint and U and W being orthogonal complements.\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is listed separately. Let me check again:\n\n- V is an IPS. Check.\n- π is a projection. Check.\n- V = U ⊕ W. Check.\n- U = ker(π). Check.\n- W = im(π). Check.\n- For any v = u + w, π(v) = w. Check.\n\nThese are all separate conditions. The problem then is to prove the if and only if statement regarding self-adjointness and orthogonality of U and W.\n\nI think that's all. Let me compare with the example given. The example had assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7, then the problem statement. Here, the assumptions are the properties of V, π, the decomposition, kernel, image, and the action of π. Then the problem is the equivalence to prove.\n\nI should structure it exactly like that. Make sure each assumption is a single line, addressing one property. The problem part is the main statement to prove.",
