    "Content": "I'm starting with the basics of topology theory and I'm trying to show: Let $A$ and $B$ be closed subsets of a topological space. If $A\\cap B$ and $A\\cup B$ are both connected, $A$ and $B$ are connected. I've tried to prove it whit subsets operations and by contradiction, but I've failed with both strategies. Can you help me, please?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Suppose for a contradiction that $A$ is disconnected. Then there are closed, disjoint, non-empty subsets $S, T$ of $A$ such that $A=S\\cup T$. Since $A\\cap B$ is connected, one of $B\\cap S$ and $B\\cap T$ must be empty, otherwise $A\\cap B=(B\\cap S)\\cup (B\\cap T)$. WLOG assume $B\\cap S=\\emptyset$. Now, since $S$ and $T$ are closed in $A$ and $A$ is closed in $X$, $S$ and $T$ are closed in $X$. Therefore, $B\\cup T$ and $S$ are closed non-empty subsets of $A\\cup B$. Obviously, $(B\\cup T)\\cap S=\\emptyset$ and $A\\cup B=(B\\cup T)\\cup S$, so $A\\cup B$ is disconnected, contradiction.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original problem is about proving that if the union and intersection of two closed subsets A and B are connected, then A and B themselves are connected.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that A and B are closed subsets of a topological space. Then, it mentions that both A ∩ B and A ∪ B are connected. The conclusion to prove is that A and B are connected. \n\nWait, the example given in the format had assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition for one object. So for this problem, the assumptions should be:\n\n- A is a closed subset of a topological space.\n- B is a closed subset of a topological space.\n- A ∩ B is connected.\n- A ∪ B is connected.\n\nEach of these is a separate condition. The original problem mentions that A and B are closed, so that's two separate assumptions. Then the connectedness of the intersection and union are two more. \n\nThe problem statement then is to prove that under these conditions, A and B are connected. So putting it all together, the formatted problem should have those four assumptions and the problem statement. \n\nWait, the original question's title is a bit different: \"If union and intersection of two subsets are connected, are the subsets connected?\" But the detailed question adds that A and B are closed. So the key here is that the user might have included the closedness as part of the problem's conditions. So I need to include those closedness conditions in the assumptions.\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n- A is a closed subset of a topological space.\n- B is a closed subset of a topological space.\n- The intersection of A and B is connected.\n- The union of A and B is connected.\n\nEach of these is a separate line. Then the problem is to prove that A and B are connected.\n\nWait, but in the example provided, the assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So each assumption is a separate condition. Similarly here, each of the four points is a separate condition. Therefore, the formatted problem should list each of these as separate assumptions.\n\nSo the final answer should be:\n\nAssumption: \nA is a closed subset of a topological space,\nB is a closed subset of a topological space,\nA ∩ B is connected,\nA ∪ B is connected.\n\nProblem: Prove that A and B are connected.\n\nYes, that's correct. The problem specifies that A and B are closed, which are separate conditions from their intersection and union being connected. Each of these needs to be listed as separate assumptions. The problem then is to prove the connectedness of A and B.",
