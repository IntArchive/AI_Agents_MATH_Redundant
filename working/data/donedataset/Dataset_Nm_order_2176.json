    "Content": "So I've been struggling with this sum for some time and I just can't figure it out. I tried proving by induction that if the sum above is a $S_n$ then $S_{n+1} = 4S_n$, but I didn't really succeed so here I am. Thanks in advance.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I can give a mildly ugly proof by induction. Let $$S_n=\\sum_{k=0}^n2^k\\binom{2n-k}n=\\sum_{k=0}^n2^k\\binom{2n-k}{n-k}=\\sum_{k=0}^n2^{n-k}\\binom{n+k}n\\;,$$ and assume that $S_n=4^n=2^{2n}$. Then $$\\begin{align*}\nS_{n+1}&=\\sum_{k=0}^{n+1}2^{n+1-k}\\binom{n+1+k}{n+1}\\\\\n&=\\sum_{k=0}^{n+1}2^{n+1-k}\\left(\\binom{n+k}n+\\binom{n+k}{n+1}\\right)\\\\\n&=\\sum_{k=0}^{n+1}2^{n+1-k}\\binom{n+k}n+\\sum_{k=0}^{n+1}2^{n+1-k}\\binom{n+k}{n+1}\\\\\n&=\\binom{2n+1}n+2\\sum_{k=0}^n2^{n-k}\\binom{n+k}n+\\sum_{k=0}^{n+1}2^{n+1-k}\\binom{n+k}{n+1}\\\\\n&=\\binom{2n+1}n+2^{2n+1}+\\sum_{k=1}^{n+1}2^{n+1-k}\\binom{n+k}{n+1}\\\\\n&=2^{2n+1}+\\binom{2n+1}n+\\binom{2n+1}{n+1}+\\sum_{k=1}^n2^{n+1-k}\\binom{n+k}{n+1}\\\\\n&=2^{2n+1}+\\binom{2n+2}{n+1}+\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}2^{n-k}\\binom{n+1+k}{n+1}\\\\\n&=2^{2n+1}+\\binom{2n+2}{n+1}+\\frac12\\left(S_{n+1}-\\binom{2n+2}{n+1}-2\\binom{2n+1}{n+1}\\right)\\\\\n&=2^{2n+1}+\\binom{2n+2}{n+1}+\\frac12\\left(S_{n+1}-2\\binom{2n+2}{n+1}\\right)\\\\\n&=2^{2n+1}+\\frac12S_{n+1}\\;,\n\\end{align*}$$ so $\\frac12S_{n+1}=2^{2n+1}$, and $S_{n+1}=2^{2n+2}=4^{n+1}$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to format a Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. The original problem is about proving that the sum from i=0 to n of 2^i multiplied by the binomial coefficient (2n-i choose n) equals 4^n. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions from the problem. The example given in the prompt shows that assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. \n\nLooking at the problem statement: the summation is from i=0 to n, and the expression involves 2^i and the binomial coefficient (2n - i choose n). The goal is to show this sum equals 4^n. \n\nWhat are the assumptions here? The problem doesn't explicitly state any conditions on n, like being an integer or positive, but typically in such sums, n is a non-negative integer. Since the original example included an assumption about n being an integer and divisible by 7, I should check if there are any implicit assumptions here.\n\nThe sum runs from i=0 to n, so i takes integer values. The binomial coefficient (2n - i choose n) requires that 2n - i is greater than or equal to n, which simplifies to i ≤ n. But since the upper limit of the sum is n, that's already satisfied. So the key assumption here is that n is a non-negative integer. The problem might not work for non-integer n or negative n, so that's a necessary condition.\n\nAnother point: the original example had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in this problem, there's no such divisibility condition mentioned. So the only assumption here is that n is a non-negative integer.\n\nWait, but in the example, the user restructured the problem by adding an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem, the user had to prove for every integer n. Hmm, maybe the example was a mistake. Wait, looking back, the original example's problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, perhaps the example was a user error. But the user is instructing me to follow the format as per their example. However, in their example, they included an assumption that n is divisible by 7 even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". That might have been a mistake in the example, but since the user provided it, maybe they want me to include assumptions even if they are not explicitly stated, but inferred from the problem's context.\n\nBut in the current problem, the sum is from i=0 to n, so n has to be a non-negative integer because the upper limit of a summation can't be a non-integer. Therefore, the assumption here is that n is a non-negative integer. The problem statement on Math Stack Exchange might not have specified that, but in mathematical contexts, such sums imply n is a non-negative integer.\n\nTherefore, the assumption should be that n is a non-negative integer. Let me check if there are any other assumptions. The problem doesn't mention any other conditions, so that's the only one.\n\nSo, structured as per the format:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a non-negative integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum_{i=0}^n 2^i\\binom{2n-i}{n} = 4^n.$$\n\nI think that's it. The original problem didn't specify any other conditions, so the key assumption is n being a non-negative integer. The example given by the user included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (divisible by 7), but perhaps that was a mistake. However, following the user's instruction to list assumptions, in this case, the only necessary assumption is that n is a non-negative integer.",
