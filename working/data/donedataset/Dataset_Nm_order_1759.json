    "AcceptedAnswer": "A simple change of variables allows you to compute $\\mathbb{E}[e^{tX}]$ for real $t$ and standard normal $X$,\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathbb{E}[e^{tX}]&=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-\\frac12x^2}e^{tx}\\,dx\\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{\\frac12t^2}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-\\frac12(x-t)^2}\\,dx\\\\\n&=\\frac{e^{\\frac12t^2}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-\\frac12y^2}\\,dy\\\\\n&=e^{\\frac12t^2}.\n\\end{align}\n$$\nHere, the substitution $y=x-t$ has been used. In fact, this identity holds for all complex $t$ as well by analytic continuation. The right hand side, $e^{\\frac12t^2}$ is clearly analytic. The left hand side is analytic, as it has the derivative $\\mathbb{E}[Xe^{tX}]$. The fact that you can commute differentiation and expectation follows from the dominated convergence theorem . Two analytic functions which agree on the real line must agree everywhere (by analytic continuation). So the identity holds for all complex $t$, and replacing $t$ by $it$ gives the expression you ask for.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. So the user wants to know if there's a more direct method to prove that the characteristic function of the standard normal distribution is e^{-t²/2}, instead of using moments. They mentioned getting stuck on showing that the integral of e^{-1/2(x - it)²} dx from -infty to infty equals sqrt(2π). \n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question and extract the assumptions and the problem. The standard normal distribution is given with its density function f(x) = (1/√(2π)) e^{-x²/2}. The characteristic function is the integral of f(x) e^{itx} dx from -infty to infty, which equals e^{-t²/2}. The user is asking for a direct proof of this, not through moments, and they're stuck on evaluating that specific integral involving (x - it)².\n\nNow, to structure this into the required format. The assumptions would include properties or conditions given in the problem. Let's list them one by one:\n\n1. The function f(x) is the standard normal distribution: f(x) = (1/√(2π)) e^{-x²/2}.\n2. The characteristic function is defined as the integral from -infty to infty of f(x) e^{itx} dx.\n3. The user is attempting to evaluate the integral ∫_{-infty}^infty e^{-1/2(x - it)²} dx and show it equals sqrt(2π).\n\nThe problem is to prove that the characteristic function of the standard normal distribution is e^{-t²/2} using a more direct method, specifically addressing the integral they're stuck on.\n\nWait, the original problem states that the characteristic function is e^{-t²/2} and the user is stuck on showing that the integral of e^{-1/2(x - it)^2} dx equals sqrt(2π). So the key assumptions here are the form of f(x), the definition of the characteristic function, and the integral they're trying to compute. The problem is to prove the characteristic function equals e^{-t²/2}, which reduces to evaluating that integral.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- f(x) is the standard normal density function: f(x) = (1/√(2π)) e^{-x²/2}.\n- The characteristic function is defined as the integral of f(x) e^{itx} over the real line.\n- The integral in question is ∫_{-infty}^infty e^{-1/2(x - it)^2} dx = sqrt(2π).\n\nBut wait, the user is trying to show that integral equals sqrt(2π). So is that an assumption or part of the problem? The user got stuck on showing that integral equals sqrt(2π), so that's part of the problem they need to solve. Therefore, the problem would be to prove that the characteristic function is e^{-t²/2}, which involves proving that integral equals sqrt(2π). \n\nHence, in the assumptions, we list the given information, and the problem is the goal. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, with assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the user said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, maybe in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem included n divisible by 7 as an assumption. Wait, perhaps there was a mistake in the example. But maybe the original problem had a different structure. Anyway, back to our problem.\n\nSo in our case, the user's problem is to prove the characteristic function is e^{-t²/2}, and they're stuck on showing that integral equals sqrt(2π). So the assumptions would be the standard normal density function, the definition of the characteristic function, and maybe the integral they're considering as part of their approach. Wait, but the problem is to prove the characteristic function is e^{-t²/2}, and the integral they're stuck on is part of their attempted method. So the problem as stated in the original question is: \"is there a more direct method of proving that the standard normal has the stated characteristic function?\" and they mention getting stuck on that integral. So the actual problem to structure is to prove that the characteristic function is e^{-t²/2}, and the integral they mentioned is part of their approach. So in the formatted problem, the problem statement would be to prove the characteristic function is e^{-t²/2}, and the assumptions are the standard normal density, the form of the characteristic function integral, and perhaps the integral they're working on. Wait, but the integral is part of their approach, not an assumption given in the problem. So maybe the assumptions are just the standard normal density and the definition of the characteristic function. The integral they mentioned is part of their own steps, not part of the problem's given conditions. Therefore, the formatted problem's assumptions should list:\n\n- f(x) is the standard normal distribution: (1/√(2π)) e^{-x²/2}.\n- The characteristic function is ∫_{-infty}^infty f(x) e^{itx} dx.\n\nAnd the problem is to prove that this integral equals e^{-t²/2}. The user's mention of being stuck on the integral ∫ e^{-1/2(x - it)^2} dx = sqrt(2π) is part of their approach, not an assumption given. Therefore, the formatted problem should include the standard assumptions and the problem to prove the characteristic function. So the final answer should be:\n\nAssumption:\n$f(x)$ is the standard normal distribution: $f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{x^2}{2}}$,\nThe characteristic function is defined as $\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x) e^{itx} dx$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the characteristic function of the standard normal distribution is $e^{-\\frac{t^2}{2}}$.",
