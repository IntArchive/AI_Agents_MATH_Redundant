    "AcceptedAnswer": "It was pointed out in the comments that you can interpret the matrix as a bilinear form and obtain the inequality $$ x^T A x = \\cos(\\pi/N) \\sum_{i=1}^N x_i^2 - \\sum_{i=1}^N x_i x_{i+1} \\cos\\theta_i \\geq 0 .$$ So, if this bilinear form is positive semidefinite, $x^T A x \\geq 0$, then all eigenvalues are nonnegative and the determinant must also be nonnegative. To show that, we rewrite the inequality by shuffling the terms a bit and adding $\\sum x_i^2$ on both sides: $$ \\sum \\left((x_i^2+x_{i+1}^2)/2 - x_i x_{i+1} \\cos\\theta_i \\right) \\geq (1-\\cos (\\pi/N)) \\sum x_i^2 .$$ The left-hand side looks suspiciously like the cosine formula for the side of a triangle. In particular, this looks like a set of vectors in the complex plane that emanate from the origin and are separated by angles $\\theta_1,\\theta_2,\\dots$ and so on. This makes a lot of sense since the angles are meant to add up to $\\pi$. We can make this geometric insight explicit by defining complex numbers $z_i = x_i e^{\\sum_{k=1}^{j-1} \\theta_j}$ and $z_{N+1} = -z_1$. The inequality becomes $$ 1/2 \\sum |z_{i+1}-z_i|^2 \\geq (1-\\cos(\\pi/N)) \\sum |z_i|^2 .$$ This looks a lot easier, because the angles are finally gone. That said, we are now dealing with complex Hilbert spaces, but they tend to be easier anyway. In particular, let $P$ be the \"permutation operator\" $$ P (z_1,z_2,\\dots,z_n)^T := (z_2,z_3,\\dots,z_n,-z_1)^T .$$ It is easy to check that this is a unitary operator, $P^\\dagger=P^{-1}$. The inequality can be written as $$ ||(P-1)z||^2 \\geq (2-2\\cos(\\pi/N)) ||z||^2 ,$$ We can prove this by showing that the eigenvalues $\\lambda_k$ of the operator $P-1$ are bounded from below by $|\\lambda_k|^2 \\geq 2-2\\cos(\\pi/N)$. After all, the operator $P-1$ is normal, so we can apply the spectral theorem. Calculating the eigenvalues of the operator $P$ is easy, because repeated application of $P$ obviously yields $P^N=-1$, but this must already be the minimal polynomial. Hence, the eigenvalues of $P-1$ are $$ \\lambda_k = e^{i\\pi k/N}-1, \\quad 0 \\leq k \\leq 2N, k \\text{ odd} .$$ Clearly, the case $k=1$ has the smallest magnitude and we have $$ |\\lambda_1|^2 = \\sin^2(\\pi/N) + (1-\\cos^2(\\pi/N)) = 2-2\\cos(\\pi/N) .$$ This proves the inequality. $\\square$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to format this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. Let's start by reading the original problem carefully. The user wants to show that the determinant of a specific matrix A is nonnegative. The matrix is an n×n matrix with cos(π/n) along the diagonal, -cosθ_i/2 on the upper and lower diagonals, and some additional elements in the corners. The conditions given are that the sum of the θ_i is π, each θ_i is between 0 and π/2, and n is at least 3.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. Each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. Let's parse the question for these:\n\n1. The matrix A is structured in a specific way: main diagonal entries are cos(π/n), the off-diagonal elements adjacent to the main diagonal (both upper and lower) are -cosθ_i/2 for each i from 1 to n-1. However, looking at the matrix provided, there's also the top-right and bottom-left corners which have -cosθ_n/2 and -cosθ_n/2 respectively. So the matrix is actually a tridiagonal matrix with additional entries at the (1,n) and (n,1) positions. So the structure of A is a tridiagonal matrix with periodic boundary conditions (like a circulant) but only for those two corners.\n\nWait, the first row has -cosθ_1/2 in the second position and -cosθ_n/2 in the last position. Similarly, the last row has -cosθ_{n-1}/2 in the second last position and -cosθ_n/2 in the first position. So actually, the matrix is tridiagonal except for the (1,n) and (n,1) entries. So that's a specific structure, maybe a cyclic tridiagonal matrix? Or a tridiagonal matrix with corners? So the structure of the matrix is an assumption here.\n\nBut how to break down the assumptions. The problem states:\n\n- The matrix A is defined as per the given matrix. Each diagonal entry is cos(π/n). The first row has -cosθ_1/2 in the second position and -cosθ_n/2 in the last position. The second row has -cosθ_1/2 in the first position, cos(π/n) on the diagonal, -cosθ_2/2 in the third position, etc. Wait, actually, looking at the matrix:\n\nFirst row:\n- cos(π/n) at (1,1)\n- -cosθ_1/2 at (1,2)\n- 0s except for (1,n) which is -cosθ_n/2\n\nSecond row:\n- -cosθ_1/2 at (2,1)\n- cos(π/n) at (2,2)\n- -cosθ_2/2 at (2,3)\n- 0s otherwise\n\nThird row:\n- 0 at (3,1)\n- -cosθ_2/2 at (3,2)\n- cos(π/n) at (3,3)\n- -cosθ_3/2 at (3,4)\n- etc.\n\nLast row (n-th row):\n- -cosθ_n/2 at (n,1)\n- 0s except for (n, n-1) which is -cosθ_{n-1}/2\n- cos(π/n) at (n,n)\n\nSo the matrix is tridiagonal except for the (1,n) and (n,1) entries, which are -cosθ_n/2. Therefore, the structure is a tridiagonal matrix with additional elements in the top-right and bottom-left corners. So that's the structure of A. But how to phrase that as an assumption? The problem says \"A is the matrix defined as...\", so maybe the first assumption is about the structure of A.\n\nBut according to the example given, the assumptions are about the conditions on the variables. Let me check the example again. The original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted assumption lists that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So in that example, the assumptions were the conditions on the variables given in the problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the conditions are:\n\n- sum_{i=1}^n θ_i = π\n\n- each θ_i is in (0, π/2)\n\n- n ≥ 3\n\nAlso, the matrix structure is given, but perhaps the structure is part of the problem statement rather than an assumption. Wait, in the example, the original problem had the definition of A(n), which was included in the problem statement. So perhaps in this case, the matrix structure is part of the problem statement, while the assumptions are the conditions on θ_i and n.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n1. The sum of θ_i from i=1 to n is equal to π.\n\n2. For each i, 0 < θ_i < π/2.\n\n3. n is an integer greater than or equal to 3.\n\nAdditionally, the problem mentions that the matrix A is defined in that specific way. But in the example, the definition of A(n) was part of the problem statement. Therefore, in this case, the matrix structure is part of the problem statement, and the assumptions are the conditions on θ_i and n. So perhaps the assumptions are the three points above.\n\nWait, but the user's instruction says: \"Assumption: <All the assumptions of the problem should be listed line by line. Each assumption addresses only one property or condition, applied to one object>\"\n\nTherefore, each assumption should be a single condition. So:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- For each i in {1, 2, ..., n}, 0 < θ_i < π/2.\n\n- The sum of θ_i from i=1 to n is π.\n\n- n is an integer satisfying n ≥ 3.\n\nAnd the problem is to show that det A ≥ 0 given that A is the matrix as defined. The matrix's structure is part of the problem statement.\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"where\" those conditions hold. So \"where\" usually introduces the conditions, which are the assumptions. So the matrix is defined with those θ_i under the conditions given. Therefore, the problem is to show the determinant is nonnegative under those conditions.\n\nSo in the formatted problem, the Problem line would be the original question, which includes the matrix definition and the request to show the determinant is nonnegative. The Assumptions are the conditions on θ_i and n.\n\nTherefore, the Assumptions should be:\n\n- For each i in {1, 2, ..., n}, 0 < θ_i < π/2.\n\n- The sum of θ_1, θ_2, ..., θ_n is π.\n\n- n is an integer greater than or equal to 3.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. Each addresses one property: the bounds on each θ_i, the sum of θ_i, and the value of n.\n\nSo that's three assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have those three assumptions and the problem statement as given.\n\nBut let me check again. The example had two assumptions: n is integer, and n divisible by 7. Both are separate conditions on n. Similarly here, the three conditions are separate.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- For each i in {1, 2, ..., n}, 0 < θ_i < π/2.\n\n- The sum of θ_1, θ_2, ..., θ_n is π.\n\n- n is an integer with n ≥ 3.\n\nProblem: Show that det A ≥ 0, where A is the given matrix.\n\nBut the matrix definition is part of the problem statement, so the problem should include that. Wait, in the example, the problem statement included the definition of A(n). Similarly here, the problem statement should include the matrix's structure. But how to present that concisely.\n\nIn the original problem, the user wrote:\n\n\"Prove that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$ is divisible by 91.\"\n\nSo they included the expression in the problem line.\n\nSimilarly, here, the problem line should include the determinant of A as given, and the matrix structure. However, the matrix is quite large. The example included the expression for A(n) in the problem line.\n\nSo the Problem line here should be: Show that the determinant of the given matrix A is nonnegative.\n\nBut perhaps to make it precise, the problem statement should include the LaTeX for the matrix. However, the matrix is quite large. Let me check the original question's formatting.\n\nIn the original question, the user wrote:\n\n$$\\det A= \\det \\begin{pmatrix}...$$\n\nBut the matrix is written out with the entries. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the problem line should include the matrix definition.\n\nSo the Problem line should be: Show that $$\\det A \\geq 0$$ where A is the matrix defined as [matrix here].\n\nBut given that the matrix is large, perhaps we need to reproduce it as per the original.\n\nBut in the example, the problem line included the expression for A(n). Similarly, here, the problem line should include the matrix A.\n\nTherefore, the problem statement is:\n\nProve that the determinant of the matrix A, defined as\n\n[matrix here]\n\nis nonnegative.\n\nBut to write it concisely, we need to include the matrix.\n\nHowever, copying the matrix as in the original problem would make it lengthy, but necessary.\n\nAlternatively, since the user provided the matrix in LaTeX, perhaps we can replicate it here.\n\nBut for the purposes of the format, perhaps the problem line can be written as:\n\nShow that $$\\det A \\geq 0$$ where A is the given n×n matrix with diagonal entries $\\cos\\frac{\\pi}{n}$, off-diagonal entries adjacent to the diagonal $-\\frac{\\cos\\theta_i}{2}$ for $i=1,\\dots,n-1$, and entries (1,n) and (n,1) equal to $-\\frac{\\cos\\theta_n}{2}$.\n\nBut perhaps that's too wordy. Alternatively, include the LaTeX matrix as in the original.\n\nBut given that the original problem's matrix is complex, maybe it's better to include it as is.\n\nTherefore, the problem line would be:\n\nShow that\n$$\\det A= \\det \\begin{pmatrix}\\cos\\frac{\\pi}{n}&-\\frac{\\cos\\theta_1}{2}&0&\\cdots&0&-\\frac{\\cos\\theta_n}{2}\\\\ -\\frac{\\cos\\theta_1}{2}&\\cos\\frac{\\pi}{n}&-\\frac{\\cos\\theta_2}{2}&\\cdots&0&0\\\\ 0&-\\frac{\\cos\\theta_2}{2}&\\cos\\frac{\\pi}{n}&\\cdots&0&0\\\\ \\vdots&\\vdots&\\vdots&\\ddots&\\vdots&\\vdots\\\\ 0&0&0&\\cdots&\\cos\\frac{\\pi}{n}&-\\frac{\\cos\\theta_{n-1}}{2}\\\\ -\\frac{\\cos\\theta_n}{2}&0&0&\\cdots&-\\frac{\\cos\\theta_{n-1}}{2}&\\cos\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\end{pmatrix} \\geq 0.$$\n\nBut to make sure the matrix is correctly formatted. Wait, in the original question, the matrix has the first row: cos(π/n) at (1,1), -cosθ_1/2 at (1,2), 0s up to (1,n) which is -cosθ_n/2.\n\nThe second row: -cosθ_1/2 at (2,1), cos(π/n) at (2,2), -cosθ_2/2 at (2,3), 0s otherwise.\n\nSimilarly, the third row starts with 0, then -cosθ_2/2, cos(π/n), etc.\n\nThe last row has -cosθ_n/2 at (n,1), then 0s until (n,n-1) which is -cosθ_{n-1}/2, and cos(π/n) at (n,n).\n\nSo the matrix is indeed a tridiagonal matrix with additional entries at (1,n) and (n,1). So the structure is cyclic in some sense. To write this matrix in LaTeX concisely, perhaps using the pmatrix environment with appropriate entries.\n\nTherefore, the Problem line should include the LaTeX code for the matrix as given in the original question. However, when I look at the original question, the matrix has ellipses in the middle. The user wrote:\n\n\\begin{pmatrix}\\cos\\frac{\\pi}{n}&-\\frac{\\cos\\theta_1}{2}&0&0&\\cdots&0&-\\frac{\\cos\\theta_n}{2}\n\\\\-\\frac{\\cos\\theta_1}{2}&\\cos\\frac{\\pi}{n}&-\\frac{\\cos\\theta_2}{2}&0&0&\\cdots&0\\\\\n0&-\\frac{\\cos\\theta_2}{2}&\\cos\\frac{\\pi}{n}&-\\frac{\\cos\\theta_3}{2}&0&\\cdots&0\\\\\n\\vdots&\\vdots&-\\frac{\\cos\\theta_3}{2}&\\ddots&\\ddots&\\vdots&\\vdots\\\\\\vdots&\\vdots&\\vdots&\\ddots&\\ddots&\\ddots&\\vdots\\\\ \\vdots&\\vdots&\\vdots&\\vdots&\\ddots&\\ddots&-\\frac{\\cos\\theta_{n-1}}{2}\\\\\n-\\frac{\\cos\\theta_n}{2}&0&\\cdots&0&0&-\\frac{\\cos\\theta_{n-1}}{2}&\\cos\\frac{\\pi}{n} \\end{pmatrix}\n\nBut the LaTeX code here is a bit messy. For the purposes of this answer, perhaps reproduce it as accurately as possible.\n\nTherefore, combining all, the formatted problem would have three assumptions and the problem statement with the matrix.\n\nSo final answer:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nFor each $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$, $0 < \\theta_i < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$,\n$\\sum_{i=1}^n \\theta_i = \\pi$,\n$n$ is an integer with $n \\geq 3$.\nProblem:\nShow that $$\\det A= \\det \\begin{pmatrix}\\cos\\frac{\\pi}{n}&-\\frac{\\cos\\theta_1}{2}&0&\\cdots&0&-\\frac{\\cos\\theta_n}{2}\\\\ -\\frac{\\cos\\theta_1}{2}&\\cos\\frac{\\pi}{n}&-\\frac{\\cos\\theta_2}{2}&\\cdots&0&0\\\\ 0&-\\frac{\\cos\\theta_2}{2}&\\cos\\frac{\\pi}{n}&\\cdots&0&0\\\\ \\vdots&\\vdots&\\vdots&\\ddots&\\vdots&\\vdots\\\\ 0&0&0&\\cdots&\\cos\\frac{\\pi}{n}&-\\frac{\\cos\\theta_{n-1}}{2}\\\\ -\\frac{\\cos\\theta_n}{2}&0&0&\\cdots&-\\frac{\\cos\\theta_{n-1}}{2}&\\cos\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\end{pmatrix} \\geq 0.$$\n###",
