    "Content": "I need to solve Problem 3.5 - 11 p. 164 of the book Partial Differential Equations by Lawrence C. Evans (2nd ed., AMS, 2010): Show that $$\n   u(x,t) = \\begin{cases}\n       -\\dfrac{2}{3}\\left(t+\\sqrt{3x+t^2}\\right); & \\text{if } 4x + t^2 >0\\\\\n       0; & \\text{if } 4x + t^2<0\n     \\end{cases}\n$$ is an (unbounded) entropy solution of $u_t + \\left(\\dfrac{u^2}{2}\\right)_x=0$ . Clearly it is easy to see that this is both unbounded and a solution to the given PDE, however I am not sure how to gather any information to say that it satisfies the entropy condition from the solution alone. Any hints would be welcomed. Edit. I know the definition (Evans, §3.4.3.b p. 150). A weak solution $u\\in L^\\infty(\\Bbb R\\times (0,\\infty))$ of the initial value problem $u_t + \\left(\\dfrac{u^2}{2}\\right)_x = 0$ with data $u|_{t=0} = g$ is an entropy solution if $$\nu(x+z,t) - u(x,t) \\leq C \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{t}\\right) z \\tag{ii}\n$$ for some constant $C>0$ and a.e. $x$ , $z \\in \\Bbb R$ , $t>0$ , with $z>0$ . Is it the one needed to solve the problem? How to use it?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question according to the specified format. The example given separates assumptions and the problem statement. So first, I need to parse the original question and extract the necessary information.\n\nThe problem is about showing that a given function u(x,t) is an unbounded entropy solution of a certain PDE. The user mentions the book by Evans, problem 3.5 - 11 on page 164. The function u is defined piecewise: for 4x + t² > 0, it's -2/3(t + sqrt(3x + t²)), and 0 otherwise. The task is to prove it's an entropy solution, specifically using the definition from Evans which involves the inequality (ii) with constants C, z>0, etc.\n\nFirst, list all assumptions. The example lists each assumption as a single line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So what are the assumptions here?\n\n1. The function u(x,t) is defined as the given piecewise function. So that's one assumption: the definition of u.\n2. The PDE in question is u_t + (u²/2)_x = 0. That's another assumption.\n3. The entropy condition given by Evans: the inequality involving u(x+z,t) - u(x,t) ≤ C(1 + 1/t)z for some C>0, a.e. x, z>0, t>0. So that's the entropy condition as per Evans.\n4. The user mentions u is unbounded and a solution to the PDE, but the problem is to show it's an entropy solution. So perhaps the assumptions include that u is a weak solution (as per the entropy solution definition), but the problem might be to verify the entropy condition. Wait, in the problem statement, the user says \"Show that u is an (unbounded) entropy solution\". So the assumptions are the definition of u, the PDE, and the entropy condition to check. But the problem is to verify the entropy condition for this u. However, the original problem may have other conditions. Let me check the original question again.\n\nOriginal problem statement: \"Show that [function] is an (unbounded) entropy solution of [PDE]\". So the assumptions would include:\n\n- u is defined as that piecewise function.\n\n- The PDE is u_t + (u²/2)_x = 0.\n\n- The entropy condition is as per Evans' definition (ii), which the user quotes: the inequality with u(x+z,t) - u(x,t) ≤ C(1 +1/t)z for some C>0, a.e. x, z>0, t>0.\n\nBut also, maybe the initial data? Wait, the problem might involve initial conditions. However, in the given problem statement, the user mentions \"data u|_{t=0} = g\", but in the specific problem, the initial data might be part of the problem. Wait, looking at the problem as stated in the question: \"Show that u(x,t) = ... is an (unbounded) entropy solution of u_t + ...=0\". So the initial data is possibly determined from u(x,0). Let's compute u(x,0):\n\nFor t=0, 4x + 0 >0 => x>0. Then u(x,0) = -2/3(0 + sqrt(3x +0)) = -2/3 sqrt(3x) for x>0, and 0 for x<0. But maybe the initial data is part of the problem's assumptions. However, the problem as stated in the question doesn't explicitly mention the initial data, so perhaps it's part of the problem's hidden assumptions. Alternatively, since u is given as a solution, perhaps the initial data is derived from u(x,0). However, in the problem statement, the user is just to show u is an entropy solution of the PDE. So the assumptions would include the definition of u, the PDE, and the entropy condition's definition. The problem is to verify that u satisfies the entropy condition.\n\nBut in the example provided, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, even though the original problem statement didn't mention that. Wait, the example given by the user seems to have modified the problem. Wait in the example, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, the assumption is \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, that seems like the user made a mistake. Wait, 91 is 7*13, so if the problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds the assumption that n is divisible by 7, then perhaps the example is incorrect. Wait, maybe the example was from a different problem. Wait, perhaps the user provided an example where they mistakenly added an extra assumption. Wait, no, the user might be demonstrating how to structure, even if in their example they made an error. But in the current problem, I need to focus on the actual question given.\n\nSo for the current problem: The function u is defined piecewise. The PDE is given. The entropy condition is defined as (ii) in Evans. So the assumptions are:\n\n1. u(x,t) is defined as the given piecewise function.\n2. The PDE is u_t + (u²/2)_x = 0.\n3. The entropy condition is given by inequality (ii) in Evans: u(x+z,t) - u(x,t) ≤ C(1 + 1/t) z for some C>0, a.e. x, z>0, t>0.\n\nBut also, the problem mentions that u is a weak solution in L^∞, but the given u is unbounded. Wait, in the problem statement, the user says Evans' definition requires u ∈ L^∞, but the given u is unbounded, so maybe that's a conflict. But the problem states \"unbounded entropy solution\", so perhaps the assumption is that u is a weak solution, even if not in L^∞, but the entropy condition still applies. However, according to the user's edit, Evans defines entropy solutions as weak solutions in L^∞, but here u is not in L^∞. So maybe the problem is relaxing that condition? Or perhaps the problem is using a different definition. The user says \"I know the definition [...] A weak solution u ∈ L^∞(R × (0,∞)) [...] is an entropy solution if [...]\". But the given u is unbounded, hence not in L^∞. Therefore, there might be a discrepancy here.\n\nHowever, the problem statement says \"Show that u [...] is an (unbounded) entropy solution\". So perhaps the problem is modifying the definition to allow unbounded solutions, but still requiring the entropy condition (ii). Therefore, the assumptions would need to include the entropy condition as given, even if u is not in L^∞. But how to structure this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key assumptions are:\n\n- The function u is defined as the piecewise function.\n\n- The entropy condition to check is (ii) from Evans, even though u is unbounded.\n\nBut the problem statement is to show that this u is an entropy solution (despite being unbounded), so the assumptions are the definition of u and the PDE. The entropy condition is part of what needs to be verified. Wait, no: in the example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the assumptions included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in the original problem, it was \"for every integer n\", so the assumption that n is divisible by 7 was not in the original problem. That suggests that perhaps the example has an error, and the user wants to list the assumptions from the problem, not add new ones. Wait, maybe not. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the user listed \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. Maybe the example is wrong, but the user provided it as an example. So perhaps the user wants to list all conditions given in the problem, each as a separate line.\n\nIn the current problem, the problem is to show u is an entropy solution. The given assumptions from the problem are:\n\n- u is defined as the piecewise function.\n\n- The PDE is u_t + (u²/2)_x = 0.\n\n- The entropy condition is (ii) from Evans.\n\nBut the problem also mentions that u is a solution to the PDE. So perhaps:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- u(x,t) is defined as the given piecewise function.\n\n- The PDE is u_t + (u²/2)_x = 0.\n\n- A weak solution u of the PDE is an entropy solution if it satisfies the inequality u(x+z,t) - u(x,t) ≤ C(1 + 1/t)z for some C>0, a.e. x, z>0, t>0.\n\nBut perhaps more precisely:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- u(x,t) is defined as the piecewise function provided.\n\n- The partial differential equation is u_t + (u²/2)_x = 0.\n\n- An entropy solution must satisfy the condition: u(x+z,t) - u(x,t) ≤ C(1 + 1/t)z for some constant C>0, almost every x, z>0, t>0.\n\nProblem: Show that u is an unbounded entropy solution of the PDE.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement says \"Show that [...] is an [...] entropy solution\", so the task is to verify the entropy condition for the given u. So the assumptions would include the definition of entropy solution (i.e., the condition (ii)), the PDE, and the definition of u. So each of these as separate lines.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entropy condition is part of the problem's requirements, not an assumption. But in the example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the assumption was that n is an integer. The problem included in the formatted version includes the divisibility by 7 as an assumption. Wait, but in the original problem, it was for every integer n. So the example's formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. That suggests that maybe the user made a mistake in the example, but regardless, we need to follow their format.\n\nBut perhaps the user in the example made a mistake, but for the current problem, we should list the assumptions as per the problem's given conditions. In the current problem, the original problem states:\n\n\"Show that [function u] is an [...] entropy solution of [PDE]\".\n\nThe given function u is piecewise defined. The PDE is given. The entropy condition is defined by Evans as (ii).\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should list the definition of u, the PDE, and the entropy condition. But wait, the entropy condition is part of the definition of an entropy solution, which is what needs to be proven. Therefore, the problem is to show that u satisfies the entropy condition given in Evans, in addition to being a weak solution. However, the problem says \"it is easy to see that this is both unbounded and a solution to the given PDE\", so the assumptions are that u is a solution to the PDE (weak solution), and the task is to show it's an entropy solution by satisfying the entropy condition. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- u(x,t) is defined as the given piecewise function.\n\n- u is a weak solution of the PDE u_t + (u²/2)_x = 0.\n\n- An entropy solution must satisfy u(x+z,t) - u(x,t) ≤ C(1 + 1/t)z for some C>0, a.e. x, z>0, t>0.\n\nProblem: Show that u is an entropy solution of the PDE (i.e., satisfies the entropy condition).\n\nBut the original problem statement says \"Show that [...] is an [...] entropy solution\", which implies that the problem is to verify the entropy condition. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- u is defined as the piecewise function.\n\n- The PDE is u_t + (u²/2)_x = 0.\n\n- The entropy condition is defined by inequality (ii) in Evans.\n\nBut since the user says \"I need to solve [...] Show that [...] is an [...] entropy solution\", so the problem is to verify the entropy condition. Therefore, the assumptions are the definition of u and the PDE. The entropy condition is part of what needs to be checked. Wait, no. Because in the example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the formatted assumptions included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But in the original problem, the divisibility by 7 was not stated. So perhaps the example is incorrect, but in our case, we need to list the assumptions as given in the problem.\n\nAlternatively, the user's example might have been intended to list the conditions required for the problem. For instance, in the example, the original problem is to show divisibility by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. But 91=13*7, so perhaps the problem actually requires n to be divisible by 7, but the original problem states \"for every integer n\". That suggests a mistake in the example. Therefore, perhaps the user's example is flawed, but we need to focus on the current problem.\n\nBack to the current problem. The problem says \"Show that u [...] is an [...] entropy solution [...]\". The assumptions given in the problem are:\n\n1. u is defined as the piecewise function.\n2. The PDE is u_t + (u²/2)_x =0.\n3. The entropy condition is defined by inequality (ii) from Evans.\n\nBut since the problem is to show that u is an entropy solution, the key assumptions are the definition of u and the PDE, and the entropy condition is part of what needs to be verified. However, according to the user's instructions, the assumptions should list all the conditions given in the problem. In the original question, the user provides the definition of entropy solution from Evans, which requires the inequality. So perhaps the assumptions include that the entropy solution must satisfy that inequality. Therefore:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- The function u(x,t) is defined as the given piecewise function.\n\n- The partial differential equation is $u_t + \\left(\\dfrac{u^2}{2}\\right)_x = 0$.\n\n- A weak solution $u$ is an entropy solution if it satisfies $u(x+z,t) - u(x,t) \\leq C \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{t}\\right) z$ for some $C>0$, a.e. $x$, $z>0$, $t>0$.\n\nProblem: Show that $u$ is an (unbounded) entropy solution of the PDE.\n\nBut in the example, the formatted problem included the assumptions from the problem statement, even if they were not all explicit. In the current case, the problem requires verifying the entropy condition, which is part of the definition. Therefore, the assumptions include the definition of u, the PDE, and the entropy condition's definition. The problem is to verify that u satisfies the entropy condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are only the properties of u and the PDE, and the entropy condition is part of the problem statement. But according to the example, the assumptions include conditions that the problem must satisfy. So perhaps in this case:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- $u(x,t)$ is defined as $-\\dfrac{2}{3}\\left(t+\\sqrt{3x+t^2}\\right)$ if $4x + t^2 >0$, and $0$ otherwise.\n\n- The PDE is $u_t + \\left(\\dfrac{u^2}{2}\\right)_x =0$.\n\n- The entropy solution must satisfy the condition $u(x+z,t) - u(x,t) \\leq C \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{t}\\right) z$ for some $C>0$, a.e. $x$, $z>0$, $t>0$.\n\nProblem: Show that $u$ is an unbounded entropy solution of the PDE.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each assumption is a separate line, each addressing one property. The first is the definition of u, the second the PDE, the third the entropy condition from Evans. The problem is to show u is an entropy solution, which involves verifying the entropy condition. Also, since u is unbounded, that's mentioned in the problem statement.",
