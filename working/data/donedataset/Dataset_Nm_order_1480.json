    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let's look at the original question. The user provided an integral that equals π and is asking for a proof. The integral is from 0 to 1 of the square root of ({1/x} divided by (1 - {1/x})) times dx over (1 - x). Here, {x} is the fractional part of x.\n\nFirst, I need to list all assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. Let's parse the problem.\n\nThe integral is from 0 to 1. The integrand involves the fractional part of 1/x. The variables and limits are defined here. The fractional part function {x} is applied to 1/x. The integral is with respect to x, and the denominator has 1 - x.\n\nSo assumptions would include:\n\n- The integral is over the interval [0, 1].\n- {1/x} denotes the fractional part of 1/x.\n- The integrand is sqrt({1/x} / (1 - {1/x})) * dx / (1 - x).\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the integrand is written as sqrt( {1/x} / (1 - {1/x}) ) * dx / (1 - x). So each part of this expression needs to be considered. However, the problem doesn't specify any restrictions beyond the integral limits and the definition of the fractional part. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The variable x is in the interval [0, 1].\n- The function {1/x} is the fractional part of 1/x.\n- The integral is taken with respect to x.\n- The integrand is sqrt({1/x}/(1 - {1/x})) * 1/(1 - x).\n\nBut maybe some of these are redundant. The key assumptions here are the interval of integration, the definition of the fractional part, and the form of the integrand. The problem is to prove that this integral equals π. The original problem didn't specify any particular conditions beyond the integral setup. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- x is a real number in the interval [0, 1].\n- {1/x} denotes the fractional part of 1/x.\n- The integrand is sqrt({1/x}/(1 - {1/x})) * 1/(1 - x).\n\nBut do we need to mention that the integral is with respect to x? Probably, since that's part of the problem statement. Also, perhaps the problem assumes that the integral converges? But maybe that's part of proving it equals π. However, the user is asking for a proof, so the assumptions are just the given conditions. Let me check the example given. In the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem, the user had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem only included n being an integer and divisible by 7. Wait, no. Wait the original problem was to prove it's divisible by 91 for every integer n. But the example formatted assumption was n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, in the original problem, the user wrote \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the example was wrong? Wait, let me check. The original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, the assumption is \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that's contradictory. So the example might have an error. But in this case, maybe the assistant needs to be careful. However, in the current problem, there's no such mistake. The integral is presented as is. So perhaps the assumptions here are:\n\n- The integral is taken over the interval [0, 1].\n- {x} denotes the fractional part of x.\n- The integrand is sqrt( {1/x} / (1 - {1/x}) ) / (1 - x) dx.\n\nBut maybe the problem is as stated, and the fractional part is only applied to 1/x. So the key assumptions are the interval, the definition of {1/x}, and the structure of the integrand. The problem is to prove the integral equals π.\n\nSo structuring according to the format:\n\nAssumption:\n- The integral is computed from 0 to 1.\n- For each x in (0,1), {1/x} denotes the fractional part of 1/x.\n- The integrand is √({1/x}/(1 - {1/x})) * 1/(1 - x) dx.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the integral ∫₀¹ √({1/x}/(1 - {1/x})) * dx/(1 - x) equals π.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user wrote the integral as ∫₀¹ sqrt( {1/x}/(1 - {1/x}) ) * dx/(1 - x). So that's the correct expression. The fractional part is applied to 1/x, and the integrand is as written. So the assumptions would list each component: interval, definition of fractional part, and the integrand's form.\n\nBut to split each assumption into one line, each addressing one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- The integral is taken over the interval [0, 1].\n- For each x in (0,1), {1/x} denotes the fractional part of 1/x.\n- The integrand is √( {1/x} / (1 - {1/x}) ) multiplied by 1/(1 - x).\n\nProblem: Prove that the given integral equals π.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", but in the original problem, it was for every integer n. So maybe the example had a mistake. But in this case, the problem is to prove the integral equals π without additional conditions. So the assumptions are just the given conditions in the problem: interval, fractional part definition, integrand structure. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The integral is from 0 to 1.\n- {1/x} is the fractional part of 1/x.\n- The integrand is √( {1/x} / (1 - {1/x}) ) / (1 - x) dx.\n\nProblem: Prove that ∫₀¹ √( {1/x}/(1 - {1/x}) ) * dx/(1 - x) = π.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third assumption can be split into two parts: the integrand's numerator and denominator? But according to the example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So the integrand as a whole is one part. But perhaps the expression inside the square root is another. But maybe not. The problem states the entire integrand as written, so the integrand's structure is a single condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fractional part's definition is separate. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- The variable x ranges from 0 to 1.\n- The fractional part {1/x} is defined as 1/x minus the floor of 1/x.\n- The integrand is defined as √( {1/x} / (1 - {1/x}) ) divided by (1 - x).\n\nBut I think the first assumption should state the integral's limits. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- The integral is taken over the interval [0, 1].\n- For x in (0,1), {1/x} denotes the fractional part of 1/x, i.e., {1/x} = 1/x - floor(1/x).\n- The integrand is √( {1/x} / (1 - {1/x}) ) / (1 - x).\n\nBut the example didn't elaborate definitions, just listed conditions. So perhaps the fractional part's definition is inherent, so the assumption is simply stating that {1/x} is the fractional part. The rest is the problem statement.\n\nSo in the example, the assumptions were n is an integer and n divisible by 7, but the original problem was for every integer n. That seems conflicting, but maybe the example was structured differently. In any case, for the current problem, the key points are the integral's interval, the fractional part's definition, and the integrand's form. Thus, the formatted problem should list those assumptions and then the problem to prove the integral equals π.",
