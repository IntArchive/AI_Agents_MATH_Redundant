    "Content": "I'm looking for a proof of $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R}) \\subset L^p(\\mathbb{R})$ for $1 \\leq p \\leq \\infty$. My informal probe follow like this: For any function $f \\in L^p(\\mathbb{R})$ exists a piecewise function $h_n$ such that $||h_n(x) - f(x)||_{L^p} \\rightarrow 0 \\ \\text{with} \\ n\\rightarrow \\infty \\ (\\forall x)$, and any $h_n$ could be approximated by compactly supported smooth functions ($C_{c}^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R})$).

Any help to formalize that, or any different proof will be helpful.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "To make Davide Giraudo's comment more clear, here are the steps: $$\n\\int |f(x)|^p = \\int \\left((1+x^2)|f(x)|\\right)^p\\frac{1}{(1+x^2)^p}\n$$ From here, since $(1+x^2)f(x)$ is bounded (because $f\\in \\mathcal{S}$), and $\\frac{1}{(1+x^2)^p}\\leq \\frac{1}{1+x^2}\\in L^1$ (for $p\\geq 1$), one gets $$\n\\int |f(x)|^p \\leq \\|(1+x^2)f(x)\\|^p_\\infty \\int \\frac{1}{1+x^2}\\leq \\pi (\\|f\\|_{0,0}+\\|f\\|_{2,0})^p\n$$ where $$\n\\|f\\|_{\\alpha,\\beta} = \\underset{x\\in\\mathbb{R}^n}{\\sup} |x^\\alpha D^\\beta f(x)|\n$$ Since $f\\in \\mathcal{S}$, $\\|f\\|_{\\alpha,\\beta}$ is finite for all $\\alpha,\\beta\\geq 0$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure a problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The example given shows how to extract assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the provided example, the original problem was about proving a number is divisible by 91, and the assumptions were that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Wait, actually in the example, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption includes that n is divisible by 7. That seems conflicting. Wait, no—the example might have a mistake. Wait, no. Let me check again. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that's a problem. Because in the original problem, the divisibility by 7 isn't mentioned. So perhaps there's an error in the example? Or maybe the user intended to modify the problem. Hmm, but maybe that example was a typo. Anyway, moving on.\n\nThe current problem is about proving that the Schwartz space S(R) is contained in L^p(R) for 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞. The user's question mentions an informal approach involving approximation by piecewise functions and density arguments. The task is to structure this into Assumptions and Problem.\n\nFirst, identify the assumptions. The problem is to show S(R) ⊂ L^p(R). What are the inherent assumptions here?\n\nThe Schwartz space consists of smooth functions that decay rapidly along with all their derivatives. To be in L^p, the integral of |f|^p must be finite. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- p is between 1 and infinity, inclusive.\n- The functions in S(R) are smooth (infinitely differentiable).\n- Schwartz functions decay rapidly: for any multi-indices α, β, |x^β D^α f(x)| is bounded, implying that |f(x)| ≤ C/(1 + |x|^k) for any k.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user is asking for the inclusion, so the key assumptions are about the properties of Schwartz functions that ensure they are in L^p. So perhaps:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- For each f in S(R), f is measurable (since L^p spaces consist of measurable functions).\n- For each f in S(R), |f(x)| decays faster than any polynomial as |x| → ∞.\n- 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞.\n\nProblem: Prove that S(R) is a subset of L^p(R) for 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞.\n\nWait, but in the original question, the user mentions their informal approach using density arguments. However, the correct approach is more straightforward, using the rapid decay of Schwartz functions. So the key assumptions are the definition of Schwartz space (rapidly decreasing functions) and the range of p.\n\nSo the assumptions should include:\n\n- f is a Schwartz function (so smooth and rapidly decreasing).\n- The measure space is R with Lebesgue measure.\n- The L^p space is defined with respect to Lebesgue measure.\n\nBut the user might not mention all that. Let me check the original question again.\n\nOriginal question: \"Prove that S(R) ⊂ L^p(R) for 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞.\" The user tried an argument using density of C_c^∞ in S(R), but the correct approach is simpler because Schwartz functions decay rapidly. So the key assumptions are the properties of Schwartz functions and the range of p.\n\nSo structuring the problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n1. The Schwartz space S(R) consists of smooth functions f such that for all multi-indices α, β, sup |x^β D^α f(x)| < ∞.\n2. 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞.\n3. The space L^p(R) consists of measurable functions f with ||f||_p < ∞.\n\nProblem: Prove that every function f in S(R) is also in L^p(R) for 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞.\n\nBut wait, the original question's user's attempt involved approximating f with piecewise functions and using density. But maybe the actual assumptions needed are the properties of Schwartz functions, not the approximation. So perhaps the problem doesn't have explicit assumptions beyond the definitions of S(R) and L^p, but the user is supposed to recognize that rapid decay implies integrability.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- For all f ∈ S(R), f is a smooth function decaying rapidly (i.e., for any N ∈ N, there exists C_N such that |f(x)| ≤ C_N / (1 + |x|)^N).\n- 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞.\n\nProblem: Prove that S(R) ⊂ L^p(R) for 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is about inclusion, the assumptions would be the definitions of S(R) and L^p. But in the example, the assumptions were specific conditions on n. Here, the problem is more about the properties of the function space.\n\nBut per the example, each assumption is a single condition on one object. So breaking it down:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- S(R) is the Schwartz space of rapidly decreasing smooth functions on R.\n- For each f ∈ S(R), f is smooth.\n- For each f ∈ S(R), f decays rapidly: for all integers k ≥ 0, sup_{x ∈ R} |x|^k |f(x)| < ∞.\n- 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞.\n\nProblem: Prove that S(R) is a subset of L^p(R) for 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞.\n\nBut maybe the user's original question didn't state all these assumptions explicitly, but they are part of the definition of S(R). However, the task is to list all assumptions from the problem. Since the problem is to prove the inclusion, the assumptions are that f is in S(R), and p is between 1 and ∞. But how to structure this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem as stated on Math SE is to prove the inclusion, so the assumptions would be:\n\n- S(R) is the space of Schwartz functions.\n- L^p(R) is the space of p-integrable functions.\n- 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were specific to the problem's variables. Here, the problem is more general. But according to the user's instructions, we need to filter the original question's irrelevant info and structure it. The original question's problem is \"Prove that S(R) ⊂ L^p(R) for 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞.\"\n\nThe user's own attempt involved approximating via piecewise functions and density, but that's probably not necessary. The key assumptions are the properties of Schwartz functions and the range of p. So the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- For any f ∈ S(R), there exist constants C_N such that |f(x)| ≤ C_N / (1 + |x|)^N for all N ∈ N.\n- 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞.\n\nProblem: Prove that S(R) is contained in L^p(R).\n\nAlternatively, since the rapid decay is part of the definition of S(R), maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- S(R) consists of smooth functions f such that for all multi-indices α, β, the function x^β D^α f(x) is bounded.\n- 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞.\n\nProblem: Prove that every f ∈ S(R) belongs to L^p(R).\n\nBut the user's original question mentions the inclusion, so the key is that Schwartz functions are in L^p. The assumptions would be the definition of Schwartz space and the range of p.\n\nSo in the example, the assumption included specific conditions on n, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted version added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like a mistake. Maybe the example was incorrect. But regardless, following the user's instruction, we need to extract all assumptions from the problem, breaking them into line items, each addressing one property of one object.\n\nIn the current problem, the main assumptions are:\n\n1. The Schwartz space S(R) consists of functions that are smooth and rapidly decreasing.\n2. The measure space is R with Lebesgue measure.\n3. 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞.\n\nBut perhaps the problem doesn't explicitly mention Lebesgue measure, but L^p is standard. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- For each f ∈ S(R), f is a smooth function on R.\n- For each f ∈ S(R) and every integer k ≥ 0, there exists a constant C_k such that |f(x)| ≤ C_k / (1 + |x|)^k for all x ∈ R.\n- 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞.\n\nProblem: Prove that S(R) ⊂ L^p(R).\n\nAlternatively, the decay condition can be phrased as:\n\n- For each f ∈ S(R), |f(x)| decays faster than any polynomial as |x| → ∞.\n\nBut per the example, each assumption should be one line, one property per object. So:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- S(R) is the space of Schwartz functions on R.\n- Every f ∈ S(R) is smooth.\n- Every f ∈ S(R) decays rapidly: for all N ∈ N, there exists C_N > 0 such that |f(x)| ≤ C_N (1 + |x|)^{-N} for all x ∈ R.\n- 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞.\n\nProblem: Prove that S(R) is a subset of L^p(R).\n\nBut the problem statement in the original question is exactly \"Prove that S(R) ⊂ L^p(R) for 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞\". So the formatted problem would list the assumptions needed for that.\n\nI think that's the correct way. The key is that Schwartz functions decay rapidly enough to be in every L^p space, and p is between 1 and infinity.",
