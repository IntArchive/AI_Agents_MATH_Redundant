    "Content": "Via a very ample divisor one can embed a Riemann surface holomorphically into some $\\mathbb{P}^n$. Now, we can then project the Riemann surface to $\\mathbb{P}^3$, and we can even go until $\\mathbb{P}^2$ if we allow nodes. If we have a Riemann surface $X$ and an embedding $f:X\\to \\mathbb{P}^2$ (where the image is smooth), then we can find the equation for $f(X)$ (you pull back the meromorphic functions $x_0/x_1$ and $x_1/x_2$ via $f$, where $x_0,x_1,x_2$ are the homogeneous coordinates of $\\mathbb{P}^2$; these are algebraically dependent over $\\mathbb{C}$, and thus they must satisfy some polynomial. The projective closure of the zeroes of this polynomial is exactly $f(X)$). I've been reading Shafarevich's book Algebraic Geometry I , and on page 86 he describes how to find the equations for a mapping to $\\mathbb{P}^n$. He simply states that if you have a map from $X$ to $\\mathbb{P}^n$, then since we can project, we can reduce to the case that the map goes to $\\mathbb{P}^2$, and we're basically done. If the Riemann surface is in $\\mathbb{P}^3$, for example, I don't see why the above method guarantees that it be defined by equations... It's image in $\\mathbb{P}^2$ would possibly have nodes... Any ideas? I'm looking to show that a compact Riemann surface in $\\mathbb{P}^3$ is algebraic, that is, can be defined by polynomial equations.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "A compact Riemann surface $X$ can always be embedded holomorphically into $\\mathbb P^3( \\mathbb C)$ . This is a highly non-trivial theorem. Claim: It cannot in general be embedded into  $\\mathbb P^2( \\mathbb C)$. The simplest argument to support this claim  is to recall that a smooth complex curve of degree $d$ in $\\mathbb P^2( \\mathbb C)$ has genus $g=\\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2}$. Since  there exist Riemann surfaces of any genus  $g\\geq 0$ on one hand, and since on the other hand most integers are not of the form $\\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2}$ , the claim is proved. However any Riemann surface can be immersed, but not necessarily injectively, into $\\mathbb P^2( \\mathbb C)$ by skilfully (or skillfully if you prefer American English) composing an embedding into $\\mathbb P^3( \\mathbb C)$  with a projection onto a plane, so that the immersed curve will  have nodal singularities at worst. Bibliography An excellent   reference for these questions is Miranda's Algebraic Curves and Riemann Surfaces . If you want to see  the complete proofs of the embedding theorem of compact Riemann surfaces into $\\mathbb P^3( \\mathbb C)$ (which implies algebraicity of said Riemann surfaces), look at Forster's Lectures on Riemann Surfaces (Springer) or at Narasimhan's Compact Riemann Surfaces (Birkhäuser). (Caution: the analysis used in these two books  is not for the faint-hearted!)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so the user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me first read through the problem carefully.\n\nThe original question is about proving that a compact Riemann surface embedded in P^3 is algebraic, meaning it can be defined by polynomial equations. The user mentions Shafarevich's approach where embedding into P^2 via projection can lead to defining equations, but in P^3, there's uncertainty because projecting to P^2 might introduce nodes. The key points here are:\n\n1. The Riemann surface X is compact.\n2. It is embedded into P^3 holomorphically.\n3. The goal is to show X is algebraic, i.e., defined by polynomial equations in P^3.\n\nThe example provided in the problem statement uses a very ample divisor to embed into some P^n, then projects to lower dimensions. The user is confused about how this works when projecting from P^3 to P^2 might result in nodes, which complicates things. But Shafarevich seems to suggest that even in P^3, the Riemann surface can be defined by equations.\n\nSo, assumptions need to be extracted. The problem states that X is a compact Riemann surface embedded in P^3, and the task is to show it's algebraic. Therefore, the assumptions should include that X is compact, it's holomorphically embedded into P^3, and perhaps that the embedding is such that the image is smooth (since when projecting to P^2, the image is smooth there). Wait, the original problem mentions \"if we have a Riemann surface X and an embedding f:X→P^2 (where the image is smooth)\", but in the case of P^3, the projection to P^2 might have nodes. However, the main problem here is about X being in P^3 and still being algebraic.\n\nTherefore, the key assumptions are:\n\n- X is a compact Riemann surface.\n- There exists a holomorphic embedding of X into P^3.\n- The image of X in P^3 is smooth (since it's an embedding, typically embeddings are smooth, but maybe this needs to be stated? Or maybe the embedding being holomorphic implies the image is a closed submanifold, hence smooth in P^3. But maybe the user is assuming the image is smooth as part of the problem. The original problem says \"if the Riemann surface is in P^3... looking to show it's algebraic\". So the main assumptions are the compactness, the embedding into P^3, and maybe the smoothness of the image. But the problem as stated in the user's question is: \"I'm looking to show that a compact Riemann surface in P^3 is algebraic, that is, can be defined by polynomial equations.\"\n\nSo, the problem is to show that such a Riemann surface, which is compact and embedded in P^3, is algebraic. The assumptions would then be:\n\n1. X is a compact Riemann surface.\n2. X is embedded holomorphically into P^3.\n3. The image of X in P^3 is smooth.\n\nBut perhaps the embedding in algebraic geometry context is already a closed immersion, which for Riemann surfaces would imply the image is a smooth subvariety. However, since the user is coming from a Riemann surface perspective, maybe we need to clarify that the embedding is holomorphic and the image is a closed complex submanifold. But the problem might not require all these technicalities. The key assumptions are compactness and being embedded in P^3. The problem is to show it's algebraic, i.e., defined by polynomial equations.\n\nTherefore, structuring the assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a compact Riemann surface,\nX is embedded holomorphically into P^3,\nThe image of X in P^3 is smooth.\n\nProblem:\nShow that X can be defined by polynomial equations (i.e., X is algebraic).\n\nBut wait, the original problem states \"a compact Riemann surface in P^3 is algebraic\", so perhaps the embedding is already assumed as a closed submanifold, and the key is to show it's the zero set of homogeneous polynomials. The user is confused because projecting to P^2 may introduce nodes, but Shafarevich's method for P^2 uses the fact that the pullback of the meromorphic functions gives algebraic dependence, leading to a defining equation. But in P^3, how does that work? The answer likely involves that any closed analytic submanifold of projective space is algebraic, by Chow's theorem. But the user is probably working in a context where they need to use the method of projections and equations, rather than invoking Chow's theorem directly. However, the problem might be expecting an application of Chow's theorem, which states that any closed analytic submanifold of projective space is algebraic. If that's the case, then the assumptions are that X is compact, holomorphically embedded (closed), and in P^3. Then the problem is to show it's algebraic. But since the user references Shafarevich's approach of projecting to P^2 and using equations, perhaps the answer is more involved.\n\nHowever, the user's question is about structuring the problem into assumptions and problem statement. So based on their example, they list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object.\n\nOriginal problem as stated by the user: \"I'm looking to show that a compact Riemann surface in P^3 is algebraic, that is, can be defined by polynomial equations.\"\n\nSo, the problem is to show that X, which is a compact Riemann surface embedded in P^3, is algebraic. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- X is a compact Riemann surface.\n- X is embedded in P^3.\n- The embedding is such that the image is a smooth projective variety.\n\nWait, but \"embedded in P^3\" in algebraic geometry usually means as a closed subvariety, which for a Riemann surface would imply it's a smooth algebraic curve. But since the user is talking about Riemann surfaces holomorphically embedded, perhaps they need to connect complex analysis with algebraic geometry. The key assumption is that X is a compact Riemann surface embedded in P^3 (holomorphically). Then the problem is to show that X is algebraic, i.e., definable by polynomials.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- X is a compact Riemann surface.\n- There exists a holomorphic embedding f: X → P^3.\n- The image f(X) is a smooth subset of P^3.\n\nProblem: Show that f(X) can be defined by polynomial equations.\n\nBut in the example given, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. So each assumption is a single condition on a single object.\n\nIn this case, the assumptions are:\n\n- X is a compact Riemann surface.\n- X is embedded holomorphically into P^3.\n- The image of X in P^3 is smooth.\n\nProblem: Show that the image of X in P^3 can be defined by polynomial equations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the smoothness is part of the embedding, so maybe just:\n\n- X is a compact Riemann surface.\n- X is embedded into P^3 as a closed complex submanifold.\n\nBut I need to check the user's original question. They mention \"a compact Riemann surface in P^3 is algebraic\", so the problem is given that X is a compact Riemann surface embedded in P^3 (as a holomorphic embedding, hence closed and smooth), show it's algebraic.\n\nBut in algebraic geometry, Chow's theorem says that any closed analytic subvariety of projective space is algebraic. So if X is embedded as a closed analytic submanifold (which a compact Riemann surface in P^3 would be), then by Chow's theorem, it's algebraic. But the user might not be aware of this theorem and is trying to use the method from Shafarevich, which involves projections and equations.\n\nHowever, the user's problem is to structure the question, not to solve it. So based on their example, they converted the original problem into assumptions and problem. In the example, they listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, but the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) divisible by 91. The user's formatted problem added the assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem had assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem didn't say n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the example says:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut that's conflicting because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like an error. Perhaps the example was a mistake, but the user wants us to follow that format.\n\nTherefore, maybe the user wants to extract the conditions from the problem statement. In the current problem, the problem is to show that a compact Riemann surface in P^3 is algebraic. So assumptions would include:\n\n- X is a compact Riemann surface.\n\n- X is embedded into P^3 (holomorphically).\n\nPossibly, the embedding is such that the image is smooth. But the original problem doesn't explicitly state that, but in algebraic geometry, an embedding usually implies that the image is a closed subvariety, which for a Riemann surface would be smooth if it's a holomorphic embedding.\n\nBut since the example seems to have added an assumption (divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem, maybe here we need to list the necessary conditions even if they are part of the problem statement. The user's original problem says \"a compact Riemann surface in P^3\", so the assumptions are:\n\n- X is a compact Riemann surface.\n\n- X is embedded into P^3.\n\nThe problem is to show that X is algebraic (defined by polynomial equations).\n\nBut in the example, they broke down the problem into assumptions and problem, even if some assumptions were part of the problem's premise. So following that, here we can do:\n\nAssumption:\n\nX is a compact Riemann surface,\n\nX is embedded into P^3,\n\nThe embedding is holomorphic,\n\nThe image of X in P^3 is smooth.\n\nProblem:\n\nShow that X can be defined by polynomial equations.\n\nBut the original problem didn't mention the embedding being holomorphic or the image being smooth, but in the context of Riemann surfaces, an embedding into P^3 would be holomorphic, and the image would be smooth. So perhaps those are implicit assumptions. However, the user's example added an assumption (n divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem. That might have been a mistake, but maybe the user wants to list all necessary conditions, even if they are part of the problem's given.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example was incorrect, and the correct approach is to list the conditions stated in the problem. The original problem here says \"a compact Riemann surface in P^3\", so the assumptions are that X is compact, a Riemann surface, and embedded in P^3. The problem is to show it's algebraic.\n\nTherefore, following the user's instruction to filter unrelated information and structure it:\n\nAssumption:\n\nX is a compact Riemann surface,\n\nX is embedded into P^3.\n\nProblem:\n\nShow that X can be defined by polynomial equations (i.e., X is algebraic).\n\nBut the original question mentions that when projecting to P^2, nodes might occur, but the user wants to know why the method still works for P^3. However, in terms of structuring the problem, the key points are compactness, being a Riemann surface, embedded in P^3. The rest (about nodes, projections) is part of the question's context but not part of the structured problem.\n\nSo final answer should be:\n\nAssumption:\n\nX is a compact Riemann surface,\n\nX is holomorphically embedded into $\\mathbb{P}^3$.\n\nProblem:\n\nShow that $X$ can be defined by polynomial equations (i.e., $X$ is algebraic).\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumptions were \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\", but the original problem said \"for every integer n\". That suggests that the example might have had a mistake, but following it, perhaps we need to list all assumptions explicitly. However, in the current problem, the assumptions are that X is compact, a Riemann surface, and in P^3. The problem is to show it's algebraic. So that's the structured version.",
