    "Content": "Let $H_n$ denote the $n$th harmonic number; i.e., $H_n = \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{i}$.  I've got a couple of proofs of the following limiting expression, which I don't think is that well-known: $$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(H_n - \\frac{1}{2^n} \\sum_{k=1}^n \\binom{n}{k} H_k \\right) = \\log 2.$$\nI'm curious about other ways to prove this expression, and so I thought I would ask here to see if anybody knows any or can think of any.  I would particularly like to see a combinatorial proof, but that might be difficult given that we're taking a limit and we have a transcendental number on one side.  I'd like to see any proofs, though.  I'll hold off from posting my own for a day or two to give others a chance to respond first. (The probability tag is included because the expression whose limit is being taken can also be interpreted probabilistically.) ( Added : I've accepted Srivatsan's first answer, and I've posted my two proofs for those who are interested in seeing them. Also, the sort of inverse question may be of interest.  Suppose we have a function $f(n)$ such that  $$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(f(n) - \\frac{1}{2^n} \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} f(k) \\right) = L,$$ where $L$ is finite and nonzero.  What can we say about $f(n)$? This question was asked and answered a while back ; it turns out that $f(n)$ must be $\\Theta (\\log n)$.  More specifically, we must have $\\frac{f(n)}{\\log_2 n} \\to L$ as $n \\to \\infty$.)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I made an quick estimate in my comment. The basic idea is that the binomial distribution $2^{−n} \\binom{n}{k}$ is concentrated around $k= \\frac{n}{2}$. Simply plugging this value  in the limit expression, we get $H_n−H_{n/2} \\sim \\ln 2$ for large $n$. Fortunately, formalizing the intuition isn't that hard. Call the giant sum $S$. Notice that $S$ can be written as $\\newcommand{\\E}{\\mathbf{E}}$\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^{n}} \\binom{n}{k} (H(n) - H(k)) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\Pr[X = k](H(n) - H(k)) = \\E \\left[ H(n) - H(X) \\right],\n$$\nwhere $X$ is distributed according to the binomial distribution $\\mathrm{Bin}(n, \\frac12)$. We need the following two facts about $X$: With probability $1$,  $0 \\leqslant H(n) - H(X) \\leqslant H(n) = O(\\ln n)$. From the Bernstein inequality , for any $\\varepsilon \\gt 0$, we know that $X$ lies in the range $\\frac{1}{2}n (1\\pm \\varepsilon)$, except with probability at most $e^{- \\Omega(n \\varepsilon^2) }$. Since the function $x \\mapsto H(n) - H(x)$ is monotone decreasing, we have\n$$\nS \\leqslant \\color{Red}{H(n)} \\color{Blue}{-H\\left( \\frac{n(1-\\varepsilon)}{2} \\right)} + \\color{Green}{\\exp (-\\Omega(n \\varepsilon^2)) \\cdot O(\\ln n)}.\n$$\nPlugging in the standard estimate $H(n) = \\ln n + \\gamma + O\\Big(\\frac1n \\Big)$ for the harmonic sum, we get:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nS \n&\\leqslant \\color{Red}{\\ln n + \\gamma + O \\Big(\\frac1n \\Big)} \\color{Blue}{- \\ln \\left(\\frac{n(1-\\varepsilon)}{2} \\right) - \\gamma + O \\Big(\\frac1n \\Big)} +\\color{Green}{\\exp (-\\Omega(n \\varepsilon^2)) \\cdot O(\\ln n)}\n\\\\ &\\leqslant \\ln 2 - \\ln (1- \\varepsilon) + o_{n \\to \\infty}(1) \n\\leqslant \\ln 2 + O(\\varepsilon) + o_{n \\to \\infty}(1).  \\tag{1}\n\\end{align*}\n$$ An analogous argument gets the lower bound\n$$\nS \\geqslant \\ln 2 - \\ln (1+\\varepsilon) - o_{n \\to \\infty}(1) \\geqslant \\ln 2 - O(\\varepsilon) - o_{n \\to \\infty}(1). \\tag{2}\n$$\nSince the estimates $(1)$ and $(2)$ hold for all $\\varepsilon > 0$, it follows that $S \\to \\ln 2$ as $n \\to \\infty$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual math professor, so I need to make sure I understand the problem thoroughly before formatting it.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the original problem on Math Stack Exchange. The title is about proving a limit involving harmonic numbers and a binomial sum. The user provided their own example, so I need to follow that structure.\n\nThe original problem states: Let H_n denote the nth harmonic number, i.e., H_n = sum_{i=1}^n 1/i. The limit to prove is lim_{n→∞} [H_n - (1/2^n) sum_{k=1}^n binom{n}{k} H_k] = log 2. The user is asking for different proofs of this limit and mentions some additional context, like a probabilistic interpretation and an inverse question. But for formatting, I need to filter out the unrelated parts.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. In the example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. However, in the current problem, the main objects are H_n, the harmonic numbers, the binomial sum, and the limit as n approaches infinity. \n\nI need to list all assumptions. The key assumptions here would be the definition of H_n as the harmonic number, the structure of the expression involving the binomial coefficients, and the limit process. Wait, but in the example, assumptions were conditions on the variables. Here, maybe the assumptions are definitions. Let me check the example again. The example listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, even though the original problem didn't state \"n is divisible by 7\" but the formatted problem included it. Wait, that seems odd. Wait, in the original problem, the user says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption adds \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, no, looking back: the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem's assumption says \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But 91 is 7*13, so maybe the original problem had a condition that n is divisible by both 7 and 13? Wait, maybe the example was modified. Wait, perhaps the example given by the user is an example of how they structured it, not necessarily matching the original problem. So maybe in their example, they added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem? Hmm, confusing. Wait, the original problem in the example is \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1 ) -6^n (3^n + 2^n ) is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem's assumptions are \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" But the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps the example has a mistake? Or maybe the original problem had a typo? Maybe the user intended that n is divisible by 7? Or perhaps 91 divides A(n) for any integer n, but in the formatted problem, they added an extra assumption. This is confusing.\n\nBut perhaps in the example, the user made an error. However, since the user is providing their own example, I need to follow their format even if there's a discrepancy. So the key is that each assumption is a single condition applied to one object. In the current problem, the assumptions would be about H_n being the harmonic number, the sum involving binomial coefficients, and the limit as n approaches infinity. But maybe the problem doesn't have specific conditions on n other than it's a positive integer approaching infinity. Wait, harmonic numbers are defined for positive integers, so n is a positive integer. But the limit is as n approaches infinity. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- H_n is the nth harmonic number: H_n = sum_{i=1}^n 1/i.\n- The sum is taken over k from 1 to n of binomial(n,k) H_k, scaled by 1/2^n.\n- The limit is taken as n approaches infinity.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about the variable n. So here, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nH_n is defined as the nth harmonic number: H_n = sum_{i=1}^n 1/i,\nThe sum ∑_{k=1}^n binom{n}{k} H_k is considered,\nThe expression is scaled by 1/2^n,\nThe limit is taken as n approaches infinity.\n\nBut each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. So breaking these down:\n\n1. H_n is the nth harmonic number defined as H_n = ∑_{i=1}^n 1/i.\n2. The sum ∑_{k=1}^n binom{n}{k} H_k is computed for each n.\n3. The sum is scaled by 1/2^n.\n4. The limit is considered as n approaches infinity.\n\nBut maybe some of these are part of the problem statement rather than assumptions. For example, the problem is to find the limit of H_n minus that scaled sum. So the assumptions are the definitions and the structure of the expression. But according to the example, the assumptions included conditions on n. However, in this problem, the main assumptions are the definitions of H_n and the form of the expression. Since the example added an assumption about n being divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem, perhaps the user's example is incorrect, but I need to follow their structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are the given conditions, and the problem is what needs to be proven. So in the current problem, the given conditions are that H_n is defined as the harmonic number, and the expression is constructed as H_n minus the average of the binomial sum. The problem is to prove that the limit is log 2.\n\nTherefore, structuring this:\n\nAssumption:\nH_n is the nth harmonic number defined as H_n = ∑_{i=1}^n 1/i,\nFor each n, the sum ∑_{k=1}^n binom{n}{k} H_k is considered,\nThe expression is H_n - (1/2^n) ∑_{k=1}^n binom{n}{k} H_k,\nThe limit is taken as n approaches infinity.\n\nBut each assumption should be a single line addressing one property. So breaking down:\n\nAssumption:\nH_n is defined as ∑_{i=1}^n 1/i,\nFor each n, the sum ∑_{k=1}^n binom{n}{k} H_k is computed,\nThe sum is scaled by 1/2^n,\nThe expression considered is H_n minus the scaled sum,\nThe limit is evaluated as n approaches infinity.\n\nBut maybe some of these are redundant. For example, the problem statement itself is \"Prove that the limit of [H_n - (1/2^n sum binom{n}{k} H_k)] is log 2.\" Therefore, the assumptions are the definitions of the components. So:\n\nAssumption:\nH_n denotes the nth harmonic number: H_n = ∑_{i=1}^n 1/i,\nFor each integer n ≥ 1, the sum ∑_{k=1}^n binom{n}{k} H_k is defined,\nThe scaling factor 1/2^n is applied to the sum,\nThe limit is taken as n approaches infinity.\n\nProblem: Prove that the limit equals log 2.\n\nYes, this seems to fit the format. Each assumption is a single line, addressing one property or condition applied to one object. The problem is then the statement to prove.",
