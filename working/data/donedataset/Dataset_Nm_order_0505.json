    "Content": "I have a small question that I think is very basic but I am unsure how to tackle since my background in computing inequalities is embarrassingly weak - I would like to show that, for a real number $p \\geq 1$ and complex numbers $\\alpha, \\beta$ , I have \\begin{equation}\n|\\alpha + \\beta|^p \\leq 2^{p-1}(|\\alpha|^p + |\\beta|^p)\n\\end{equation} I thought it would be best to rewrite this as \\begin{equation}\n\\left|\\frac{\\alpha + \\beta}{2}\\right|^p \\leq \\frac{|\\alpha|^p + |\\beta|^p}{2}\n\\end{equation} but then I am unsure what to do next - is this a sensible start anyways ? Any help would be great ! (P.S. this is not a homework question - I am currently trying to brush up my knowledge of $L^p$ spaces, and this inequality came up as a statement. I thought it might be worthwhile to  make sure I can fill in the gaps to improve my skills in computing inequalities.)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The map $x\\mapsto x^p$ for $x\\geq 0$ is convex, since its second derivative is $p(p-1)x^{p-2}\\geq 0$. We have \n$$\\left|\\frac{a+b}2\\right|^p\\leq \\left(\\frac{|a|+|b|}2\\right)^p\\leq \\frac{|a|^p+|b|^p}2.$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The user provided an example where they listed assumptions and then the problem. So first, I need to read through the Math Stack Exchange question carefully and extract all the assumptions.\n\nThe title is about showing an inequality involving |α + β|^p. The problem statement mentions that p is a real number ≥ 1, and α and β are complex numbers. The user wants to prove that |α + β|^p ≤ 2^{p-1}(|α|^p + |β|^p). \n\nLooking at the example, each assumption is listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So here, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. p is a real number.\n2. p ≥ 1.\n3. α is a complex number.\n4. β is a complex number.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user starts with \"for a real number p ≥ 1 and complex numbers α, β\". So breaking that down: p is real, p ≥1, α is complex, β is complex. Each of these is a separate assumption. The example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as two separate assumptions. So following that structure, each condition on each variable should be its own line.\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n- p is a real number.\n- p is greater than or equal to 1.\n- α is a complex number.\n- β is a complex number.\n\nThen the problem is to show the inequality |α + β|^p ≤ 2^{p-1}(|α|^p + |β|^p).\n\nThe user also mentioned rewriting it as |(α + β)/2|^p ≤ (|α|^p + |β|^p)/2, but that's part of their attempt, not part of the problem statement. So the formatted problem should only include the original problem's conditions and the problem to be proven.\n\nI don't see any other assumptions in the problem. The original problem doesn't mention any restrictions on α and β other than being complex, so those are the key points. Let me double-check if there's anything else. The problem is about proving the inequality, so all necessary conditions are p ≥1, p real, α and β complex. The user's attempt to divide by 2 is their approach, not part of the problem's assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list those four assumptions and then state the problem as given.",
