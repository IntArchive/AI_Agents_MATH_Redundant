    "Content": "Expanding on an earlier question , I am trying to prove that $$I = \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\log(x) \\arctan(x)}{1 + x^2} \\, dx = \\frac78 \\zeta(3)$$ using complex analysis but am running into some issues. My attempt : Let $f(z) = \\dfrac{\\log^2(z) \\arctan(z)}{a^2 + z^2}$ (where $\\log^2(z) \\equiv (\\log(z))^2$ ) with $0<a<1$ , and let $$I(a) = \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\log(x) \\arctan(x)}{a^2 + x^2} \\, dx \\quad .$$ Take $\\mathcal C$ to be the same positively-oriented contour (redrawn here) with branch cuts along $[0,\\infty)$ and $\\pm[i,i\\infty)$ . The larger arc has radius $R>1$ and the smaller ones each have radii $\\varepsilon$ . The dotted circles indicate the poles at $z=\\pm ia$ .

Let $a\\to1^-$ . We already know $J(1)=\\dfrac{\\pi^2}8$ , and it's easy to show that $L(1)=-\\dfrac{\\pi^2}8$ (correct) and $K(1)=-\\dfrac78\\zeta(3)$ (not correct!). The last integral is $$M(a) = \\int_1^\\infty \\frac{dx}{a^2-x^2} = \\frac1{2a} \\log\\left(\\frac{1-a}{1+a}\\right) \\quad .$$ Now by the residue theorem, $$\\begin{align*}\n\\oint_{\\mathcal C} f(z) \\, dz &= 2\\pi i \\cdot -\\frac{2\\log^2(a) + 4i\\pi \\log(a) - \\frac{5\\pi^2}2}{4a} \\log\\left(\\frac{1-a}{1+a}\\right) \\\\[1ex]\n&= -4\\pi i \\, I(a) + 4\\pi^2 \\, J(a) - 2i\\pi \\, K(a) + 4\\pi^2 \\, L(a) + \\frac{5i\\pi^3}2 M(a) \\\\[3ex]\n\\implies I(a) &= \\frac{4\\log^2(a) + 8i\\pi \\log(a) - 5\\pi^2}{16a} \\log\\left(\\frac{1-a}{1+a}\\right) \\\\[1ex]\n&\\qquad - \\pi i \\, J(a) - \\frac12 K(a) - \\pi i \\, L(a) + \\frac{5\\pi^2}8 M(a) \\\\[3ex]\n\\implies I &= \\frac{5\\pi^2}{16} \\lim_{a\\to1^-} \\underbrace{\\left(2\\,M(a) - \\frac1a \\log\\left(\\frac{1-a}{1+a}\\right)\\right)}_{=0} - \\frac{i\\pi^3}8 + \\frac7{16}\\zeta(3) + \\frac{i\\pi^3}8 \\\\[1ex]\n&= \\frac7{16}\\zeta(3) \\neq \\frac78 \\zeta(3)\n\\end{align*}$$ All that's left is to figure out where that extra factor of $\\frac12$ came from ... Where is the mistake? There was this very similar integral with $1+x$ in place of $1+x^2$ , but with no obvious use of contour integration among its answers. I also found $I$ 's value appearing in another question and slightly less conspicuously in this integral , which leads to a nice identity that helps verify the result. Substituting $e^{-x}\\mapsto x$ and integrating by parts yields $$\\int_0^\\infty \\arctan^2(e^{-x}) \\, dx = \\int_0^1 \\frac{\\arctan^2(x)}x \\, dx = -2 \\int_0^1 \\frac{\\log(x) \\arctan(x)}{1+x^2} \\, dx$$ and by subsequently replacing $x\\mapsto\\frac1x$ one gets $$\\frac\\pi2 G = \\left\\{\\int_1^\\infty -\\int_0^1\\right\\} \\frac{\\log(x) \\arctan(x)}{1+x^2} \\, dx$$ Now $$\\begin{align*}\n\\int_0^\\infty \\arctan^2(e^{-x}) \\, dx &= \\frac\\pi2 G - \\frac78 \\zeta(3) \\\\[1ex]\n\\implies \\int_0^1 \\frac{\\log(x) \\arctan(x)}{1+x^2} \\, dx &= -\\frac\\pi4 G + \\frac7{16} \\zeta(3) \\\\[1ex]\n\\implies \\int_1^\\infty \\frac{\\log(x) \\arctan(x)}{1+x^2} \\, dx &= \\frac\\pi4 G + \\frac7{16} \\zeta(3)\n\\end{align*}$$ and the result follows.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse through this problem. The user is trying to prove that the integral from 0 to infinity of (log(x) arctan(x))/(1 + x²) dx equals 7/8 times the Riemann zeta function at 3. They're using complex analysis with a specific contour and some branch cuts, but they're getting 7/16 ζ(3) instead of 7/8. So, they must have made a mistake somewhere in their contour integration setup.\n\nFirst, let me understand the setup. They define a function f(z) = (log²(z) arctan(z))/(a² + z²), and integrate it over a contour that includes keyhole shapes around the branch cuts on [0, ∞) and ±[i, i∞). The residues at z = ±ia are considered. Then, by residue theorem, they relate the integral around the contour to the sum of residues. However, when they compute everything, they end up with half the expected value.\n\nLooking at their parameterization of the branches, especially parts B, B', C, C', there's a mention of corrections in red, changing some coefficients from 1 to 3 and 9. Maybe they missed some contributions from the log branches? The log function on the complex plane has branches, and when you go around a branch cut, you pick up multiples of 2πi. But in their case, the branch cuts are along [0, ∞) and the imaginary axis upwards from i. So, moving around these cuts would affect the argument of log(z).\n\nWait, the original log(z) has a branch cut on [0, ∞), so crossing that would add 2πi to the log. But here, they also have branch cuts on ±[i, i∞), which might be related to the arctan(z) function? Arctan(z) can be expressed in terms of logs, so maybe arctan(z) has its own branch cuts. That complicates things because both log(z) and arctan(z) contribute to the branch cuts. If the user didn't account for both correctly, that might lead to missing terms.\n\nLooking at their residues calculation, they have residues at z=ia and z=-ia. The expressions for the residues involve log²(ia) and log²(-ia). Let me check if their log definitions are consistent. For example, log(ia) would be log(a) + iπ/2, assuming the principal branch where the argument is between -π and π. Similarly, log(-ia) would be log(a) - iπ/2. But in their residues, they have log²(ia) as (log(a) + iπ/2)² = log²(a) + iπ log(a) - π²/4, which seems right. Similarly for log(-ia), but they have a term with 3iπ log(a) - 9π²/4. Wait, how does log(-ia) become log(a) + 3iπ/2? That would be if the argument wraps around another 2π, but in the principal branch, log(-ia) should have argument -π/2. Unless their contour is causing the log to pick up additional terms due to crossing branch cuts multiple times.\n\nAh, maybe when they go around the branch cut on the imaginary axis, the arctan(z) function contributes additional terms. Arctan(z) is log((i - z)/(i + z))/(2i), so its branch cuts are where the argument inside the log crosses the negative real axis. That would occur when (i - z)/(i + z) is real and negative, which happens when z is on the imaginary axis outside [-i, i]. So arctan(z) has branch cuts on [i, i∞) and [-i, -i∞), which matches the user's setup. Therefore, when moving around these branch cuts, the arctan(z) function would pick up multiples of π, depending on how many times you circle around.\n\nIn their parameterization of the banks B, B', C, C', they have expressions for f(z) approaching the branch cuts. For example, on B and B', which are near the cut [i, i∞), the arctan(z) would have different branches. The user's initial attempt had some coefficients wrong (corrected from 1 to 3 in the log terms), which might mean that they initially didn't account for multiple crossings of the branch cuts, leading to incorrect residues.\n\nAnother point is when they take the limit as a approaches 1. They mention that M(a) becomes (1/(2a)) log((1 - a)/(1 + a)), which as a approaches 1, log((1 - a)/(1 + a)) approaches log(0) which is -infinity, but multiplied by 1/(2a) which is finite, so M(a) tends to -infinity. But in their final expression, they have terms involving M(a) which cancel out, but maybe there's an error in handling these limits? They say that the combination 2M(a) - (1/a) log(...) approaches zero, but maybe that's not the case.\n\nWait, their final expression for I(a) involves terms with M(a), and as a approaches 1, they take the limit and find that some terms cancel. However, if their earlier steps have incorrect coefficients due to branch cut miscalculations, that would propagate into the residues and hence into the expression for I(a). The user ends up with 7/16 ζ(3) instead of 7/8, so exactly half. That suggests maybe they missed a factor of 2 somewhere. Where could that happen?\n\nLooking at the residues: when they compute the residues at z=ia and z=-ia, they might have missed a contribution from one of the poles. Wait, if a approaches 1, the poles approach z=i and z=-i. But in their setup, they have a as a parameter between 0 and 1, so poles at ±ia. However, when a approaches 1, those poles approach ±i. But the original integral has 1 + x² in the denominator, so when a=1, the denominator becomes 1 + x². However, in their setup, they have a² + x². So maybe as a approaches 1, their integral I(a) approaches the desired integral I. But in their residue calculation, they sum the residues at ia and -ia. If there was a miscalculation in the residues, like missing a factor of 2, that could lead to the half result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they made a mistake in the argument of the logarithm when calculating the residues. For example, when they compute log(ia), if they take the argument as π/2, but due to the branch cut, maybe it's actually -3π/2 or something, leading to extra terms. However, in the principal branch, log(ia) should have argument π/2. Similarly, log(-ia) would be log(a) - iπ/2. But in their residue at z=-ia, they have log²(-ia) = (log(a) + 3iπ log(a) - 9π²/4). Wait, that seems like log(-ia) is being taken as log(a) + 3iπ/2. Where does the 3iπ come from?\n\nAh, here's a possible mistake. If the contour wraps around the branch cut on the imaginary axis, then when approaching from below (for z = -ia), the logarithm might accumulate an additional 2πi when circling around the branch cut. So log(-ia) would be log(a) + iπ/2 (principal branch) minus 2πi, giving log(a) - 3iπ/2. Then squaring that would give log²(-ia) = log²(a) - 3iπ log(a) - 9π²/4. But in their corrected version, they have +3iπ log(a). Wait, maybe there's a sign error here.\n\nWait, let's compute log(-ia). Let me think: -ia is a point on the negative imaginary axis. If a is between 0 and 1, then -ia is -i times a positive number less than 1, so it's on the negative imaginary axis below -i. Wait, but if a is approaching 1, then -ia approaches -i. However, the branch cut for log(z) is on [0, ∞), so points on the negative imaginary axis are not on the branch cut of log(z). Wait, but the user has another branch cut for arctan(z) on ±[i, i∞). Hmm, perhaps the branch cut for arctan(z) affects the argument when computing residues.\n\nAlternatively, maybe when calculating the residue at z=-ia, the function arctan(z) has a different branch there. Since arctan(z) = (1/(2i)) log((i - z)/(i + z)), when z is near -ia (which is near -i when a approaches 1), the argument of the log could be on a different branch. So maybe the user didn't correctly account for the branch of arctan(z) when z is near -i, leading to an incorrect residue.\n\nLooking at their residue at z=-ia: they have log²(-ia) which they expand as (log²(a) + 3iπ log(a) - 9π²/4). If log(-ia) is log(a) + 3iπ/2, then squaring gives log²(a) + 3iπ log(a) - 9π²/4. But why is there a 3iπ/2? If the branch cut for log(z) is on [0, ∞), then the argument for -ia (which is on the negative imaginary axis) should be -π/2, right? Because in the principal branch, the argument of -i is -π/2. So log(-ia) = log(a) + i*(-π/2). Therefore, log(-ia) = log(a) - iπ/2. Then, log²(-ia) would be (log(a) - iπ/2)^2 = log²(a) - iπ log(a) - π²/4. But the user has +3iπ log(a) -9π²/4. That suggests that they have an extra 2πi in the log when computing at z=-ia. So they might have added 2πi when they shouldn't have, or subtracted when they should have added.\n\nWait, perhaps when moving around the contour, the logarithm gains an extra term when crossing the branch cut. For example, when you go around the branch cut on the positive real axis, log(z) becomes log(z) + 2πi. But the user's contour also includes branch cuts on the imaginary axis. If the point -ia is on the other side of a branch cut for the logarithm, then the argument might differ by 2π. But since the branch cut of log(z) is on [0, ∞), the points on the negative imaginary axis are not on the branch cut, so their arguments should be as per the principal branch. So maybe the user incorrectly assumed that log(-ia) has an extra 2πi term, leading to the 3iπ/2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the arctan(z) function contributes a different branch. If arctan(z) has a branch cut on [i, i∞), then approaching z=-ia from different sides might cross that branch cut, adding a multiple of π to arctan(z). If that's not accounted for, it could lead to an incorrect residue.\n\nIn their residue calculation for z=-ia, they have arctan(-ia). Let's compute arctan(-ia). Since arctan(z) = (1/(2i)) log((i - z)/(i + z)). So arctan(-ia) = (1/(2i)) log((i + ia)/(i - ia)). Simplify inside the log: (i + ia)/(i - ia) = (i(1 + a))/(i(1 - a)) = (1 + a)/(1 - a). So log((1 + a)/(1 - a)) is real, since a is between 0 and 1. Therefore, arctan(-ia) = (1/(2i)) log((1 + a)/(1 - a)). But log of a positive real number is real, so arctan(-ia) is purely imaginary. However, the user's expression for arctan(-ia) includes terms like -i/2 log(...) + 1/2 arg(...). Maybe they are decomposing the log into modulus and argument, but if (1 + a)/(1 - a) is positive, the argument is zero, so arctan(-ia) = (1/(2i)) log((1 + a)/(1 - a)) = -i/2 log((1 + a)/(1 - a)). That seems correct.\n\nBut in their residue calculation, they have for z=-ia:\n\nResidue = [log²(-ia) arctan(-ia)] / (-2ia)\n\nThey expand log²(-ia) as (log²(a) + 3iπ log(a) - 9π²/4). But if log(-ia) should be log(a) - iπ/2, then squared is log²(a) - iπ log(a) - π²/4. So why is there a 3iπ log(a) and 9π²/4?\n\nAh, this must be the mistake. The user incorrectly added 2πi to the log when computing log(-ia). If they thought that crossing the branch cut on the imaginary axis adds 2πi, then log(-ia) would be log(a) - iπ/2 + 2πi, leading to log(-ia) = log(a) + 3iπ/2. Then squaring that would give log²(a) + 3iπ log(a) - 9π²/4. But if the branch cut for log(z) is on [0, ∞), then moving around the imaginary axis doesn't cross the log branch cut. Therefore, the argument of -ia is -π/2, so log(-ia) should be log(a) - iπ/2. Therefore, the correct expansion should be log²(a) - iπ log(a) - π²/4. The user's version has an extra 2πi added, leading to the incorrect coefficients.\n\nSo this suggests that in the residue at z=-ia, the log²(-ia) term is miscalculated, adding an extra 2πi where it shouldn't. Consequently, this incorrect residue contributes an extra term that leads to the final result being half of what it should be. By correcting the log(-ia) term, the residue would contribute a different amount, possibly doubling the result to get 7/8 ζ(3).\n\nAnother possible mistake is in the handling of the integrals along the contours B, B', C, C'. The user mentions corrections in red, changing coefficients from 1 to 3 and π² to 9π². If those corrections were not fully accounted for in all places, it might leave residual terms. For example, in the C and C' contours, the corrected terms have 3iπ log(x) and 9π²/4. If those corrections affect the integral contributions, missing them would lead to missing terms in the final expression.\n\nAlso, when they take the limit as a approaches 1, the term M(a) becomes singular, but their combination 2M(a) - (1/a) log((1 - a)/(1 + a)) approaches zero. If M(a) is (1/(2a)) log((1 - a)/(1 + a)), then 2M(a) is (1/a) log((1 - a)/(1 + a)), which cancels with the other term. So that part seems okay.\n\nPutting this together, the main mistake seems to be in the residue at z=-ia, where an extra 2πi was added to the logarithm, leading to an incorrect contribution. By correcting that, the residue would properly account for the terms, leading to the correct coefficient of 7/8 instead of 7/16.
