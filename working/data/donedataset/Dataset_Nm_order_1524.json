    "Content": "So I want to show that $\\langle a^m \\rangle \\cap \\langle a^n \\rangle = \\langle a^{\\operatorname{lcm}(m, n)}\\rangle$. My approach to this problem was to show a double containment, i.e. to show that $\\langle a^m \\rangle \\cap \\langle a^n \\rangle \\subseteq  \\langle a^{\\operatorname{lcm}(m, n)}\\rangle$ and $ \\langle a^{\\operatorname{lcm}(m, n)}\\rangle \\subseteq \\langle a^m \\rangle \\cap \\langle a^n \\rangle$. I would like to see a full proof for this, specifically $\\langle a^m \\rangle \\cap \\langle a^n \\rangle \\subseteq \\langle a^{\\operatorname{lcm}(m, n)}\\rangle$. (I tried it with the approach of breaking it down into to cases; $a$ has infinite order and $a$ has finite order, the latter of which i would appreciate the most help on.) My approach to solving the whole problem: (I would appreciate any feedback on anything that is wrong, or a different approach to the proof.) To show the easier containment, $\\langle a^{\\operatorname{lcm}(m, n)}\\rangle \\subseteq \\langle a^m \\rangle \\cap \\langle a^n \\rangle$, I did the following:\n Let $l = \\operatorname{lcm}(m, n)$. Let $j \\in \\langle a^l\\rangle$, so $j = (a^l)^k = a^{lk}$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb Z$. Since $l$ is a multiple of $m$ and $n$ by definition, we can say $l = ms = nt$ for some $s, t \\in \\mathbb Z$. Now $j = a^{kl} = a^{kms} = (a^m)^{ks} \\in \\langle a^m\\rangle$. Similarly, $j = a^{kl} = a^{knt} = (a^n)^{kt} \\in \\langle a^n\\rangle$. Now, since $j \\in \\langle a^m\\rangle$ and $j \\in \\langle a^n\\rangle$, it follows that $j \\in \\langle a^m \\rangle \\cap \\langle a^n \\rangle$. Thus, by definition, $\\langle a^{\\operatorname{lcm}(m, n)}\\rangle \\subseteq \\langle a^m \\rangle \\cap \\langle a^n \\rangle$. For the second containment, the one which I'm having more problems with, I attempted the following: Case in which $a$ is infinite: Suppose that $\\vert a \\vert = \\infty$. Let $c \\in \\langle a^m \\rangle \\cap \\langle a^n \\rangle$. Then $c = a^{mx} = a^{ny}$ where $x, y \\in \\mathbb Z$. It follows that $a^{mx - ny} = e$ and so $mx = ny$ because if $mx  > ny$ then the difference would not be zero, and we would have an element that was finite, contradicting our hypothesis. And since $mx = ny$ we know $\\operatorname{lcm}(mx, ny) = mx = ny$ and $\\operatorname{lcm}(mx, ny)$ is a multiple of $\\operatorname{lcm}(m, n)$. Hence $c \\in \\langle a^{\\operatorname{lcm}(m, n)}\\rangle$ and thus $\\langle a^m \\rangle \\cap \\langle a^n \\rangle \\subseteq  \\langle a^{\\operatorname{lcm}(m, n)}\\rangle$. Case in which $a$ is finite: I tried starting it out the same as the previous case, but i could never reach my conclusion :(",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "$\\def\\lcm{\\mathrm{lcm}}$Let $k$ be the order of $a$, with $k=0$ if $a$ is of infinite order. Note that $x\\equiv y \\pmod{0}$ is equivalent to $x=y$ (since $0|x-y$ if and only if $x-y=0$). Also, $\\mathrm{lcm}(n,0) = \\gcd(n,0) = n$. Consider first the case with $n|k$ and $m|k$. To show $\\langle a^m\\rangle\\cap\\langle a^n\\rangle \\subseteq \\langle a^{\\lcm(m,n)}\\rangle$, let $x$ lie in the intersection. Then there exist $r,s\\in\\mathbb{Z}$ such that $x=a^{mr} = a^{ns}$, so $mr\\equiv ns\\pmod{k}$. Thus, $k|mr-ns$, so $n|mr-ns$ and $m|mr-ns$. Therefore, $n|mr$ and $m|ns$. Since $n|mr$, then $mr$ is a common multiple of $n$ and $m$, hence is a multiple of $\\lcm(m,n)$ (similarly with $ns$), so we can find $q$ such that $mr=q\\lcm(m,n)$. Thus, $x = a^{mr} = a^{q\\lcm(m,n)}\\in\\langle a^{\\lcm(m,n)}\\rangle$, as desired. Now for the general case, note that $\\langle a^n\\rangle = \\langle a^{\\gcd(n,k)}\\rangle$; thus, we are reduced to showing that $\\lcm(n,m) \\equiv \\lcm(\\gcd(n,k),\\gcd(m,k))\\pmod{k}$. This is true, but you may not have it in your arsenal yet, so here's a proof (that no doubt Bill Dubuque can prove in a much slicker way): Lemma. $\\lcm(\\gcd(n,k),\\gcd(m,k)) = \\gcd(\\lcm(n,m),k)$. Proof. Indeed, $\\gcd(n,k)$ and $\\gcd(m,k)$ both divide $k$, hence their least common multiple divides $k$; and $\\lcm(n,m)$ is a common multiple of $\\gcd(n,k)$ and $\\gcd(m,k)$, so $\\lcm(\\gcd(n,k),\\gcd(m,k))$ divides $\\lcm(n,m)$. Thus, the left hand side divides the right hand side. Conversely, let $p$ be a prime and suppose that $p^a$ is the largest power of $p$ that divides $\\gcd(\\lcm(n,m),k)$. Then $p^a$ divides both $\\lcm(n,m)$ and $k$, but $p^{a+1}$ does not divide at least one of them. Since $p^a$ divides $\\lcm(n,m)$, then $p^a$ divides either $n$ or $m$, and we also know $p^a$ divides $k$. Either $p^{a+1}$ does not divide $k$, or it does not divide either $n$ or $m$. Thus, $p^a$ divides either $\\gcd(n,k)$ or $\\gcd(m,k)$, but $p^{a+1}$ divides neither. Therefore, $p^a$ is the largest power of $p$ that divides $\\lcm(\\gcd(n,k),\\gcd(m,k))$. $\\Box$ Now the result follows: note that $\\gcd(\\lcm(n,m),k) \\equiv \\lcm(n,m)\\pmod{k}$ (express $\\gcd(\\lcm(m,n),k)$ as a linear combination of $\\lcm(m,,n)$ and $k$), so we are done.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to show that the intersection of the cyclic subgroups generated by a^m and a^n in a group is equal to the cyclic subgroup generated by a^lcm(m,n). They mentioned using double containment, which is a standard approach for such proofs. The user seems confident about the first containment but is struggling with the reverse, especially when the element a has finite order. Let me parse through their attempt and see where they might need help.\n\nFirst, in the easier containment, they correctly note that if l = lcm(m,n), then any element of <a^l> is a power of a^l, which can be expressed as a^{kl}. Since l is a multiple of both m and n, this element is in both <a^m> and <a^n>, hence in their intersection. That makes sense.\n\nFor the reverse containment, they considered two cases: when a has infinite order and when it has finite order. In the infinite case, they started by taking an element c in the intersection, so c = a^{mx} = a^{ny} for some integers x, y. Then they deduced that a^{mx - ny} = e (the identity), leading to mx = ny because otherwise, the exponent would be non-zero, implying a finite order, which contradicts the infinite order assumption. From mx = ny, they argue that lcm(mx, ny) = mx = ny and that this lcm is a multiple of lcm(m,n). Wait, that part seems a bit unclear. Let me think.\n\nIf mx = ny, then both m and n divide mx (since m divides mx obviously, and n divides ny = mx). Therefore, mx is a common multiple of m and n, so lcm(m,n) divides mx. Hence, mx = k * lcm(m,n) for some integer k. Therefore, c = a^{mx} = a^{k * lcm(m,n)} which is in <a^{lcm(m,n)}>, so that works. Maybe they need to clarify that step more, showing that mx must be a multiple of lcm(m,n).\n\nNow for the finite order case, the user says they tried starting similarly but couldn't conclude. Let me think about how to approach that. Suppose the order of a is finite, say ord(a) = d. Then, the cyclic group generated by a is isomorphic to Z_d, and the subgroups <a^m> and <a^n> correspond to the subgroups generated by m and n in Z_d. The intersection of two cyclic subgroups in Z_d is generated by the lcm of their generators modulo d. Wait, but maybe I need to relate this back to the exponents.\n\nIn the finite order case, let’s take c in <a^m> ∩ <a^n>, so c = a^{mx} = a^{ny} for some integers x, y. Then, mx ≡ ny mod d. So, the equation mx ≡ ny mod d must hold. The goal is to show that c is a power of a^{lcm(m,n)}. Let me recall that in a cyclic group of order d, the order of a^k is d/gcd(d,k). So, the subgroup generated by a^m has order d/gcd(d,m), and similarly for a^n. The intersection of two subgroups in a cyclic group is generated by the element whose order is the lcm of the orders of the subgroups. Wait, no, actually, the intersection of <a^m> and <a^n> is generated by a^l where l is the lcm of m and n modulo d. Hmm, maybe I need to connect lcm(m,n) with the exponents.\n\nAlternatively, using exponents, we can consider that in the finite case, since ord(a) = d, then a^k = e iff d divides k. So, from a^{mx} = a^{ny}, we have a^{mx - ny} = e, which implies d divides mx - ny. So mx ≡ ny mod d. Let’s denote l = lcm(m,n). We need to show that c = a^{mx} can be written as a^{kl} for some integer k.\n\nBut how? Let’s see. Let’s set l = lcm(m,n), so l = m*m’ = n*n’ where m’ = l/m, n’ = l/n, and gcd(m’,n’) = 1? Wait, no, maybe m’ and n’ are m/gcd(m,n) and n/gcd(m,n)? Not sure. Let me recall that lcm(m,n) = (m*n)/gcd(m,n). So, perhaps express l in terms of m and n.\n\nGiven that l = lcm(m,n), then there exist integers s, t such that l = m*s = n*t, and s and t are coprime? Hmm, not necessarily. Alternatively, since l is the least common multiple, m divides l and n divides l.\n\nBut perhaps we need to find an exponent k such that mx = l*k. If that's possible, then c = a^{l*k} which is in <a^l>. So, mx = l*k. Thus, k = mx / l. So, we need mx to be a multiple of l. Since l = lcm(m,n), then l divides mx if and only if n divides x. Wait, maybe not directly. Let's think.\n\nSince l = lcm(m,n), then m divides l and n divides l. Let’s write l = m*s and l = n*t. Then, mx = ny implies m*s divides mx (since l divides mx if we can show that). Wait, from mx ≡ ny mod d, and mx = ny + d*q for some integer q. But maybe in the finite case, we need to use the order d. Let me consider the exponents modulo d.\n\nAlternatively, using the structure theorem for cyclic groups: in a cyclic group of order d, the intersection of <a^m> and <a^n> is generated by a^l where l is the lcm(m,n). But perhaps that's the result we are trying to prove, so we can't use that directly.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. In the finite cyclic group, the subgroup generated by a^m has order d / gcd(d,m). Similarly for a^n. The intersection of two subgroups in a cyclic group is the subgroup generated by the element with order equal to the lcm of the orders of the two subgroups. Wait, the intersection of two subgroups in a cyclic group is the subgroup whose order is the gcd of their orders. Wait, no, actually, in general, in a cyclic group, the intersection of <a^k> and <a^m> is <a^l> where l is the lcm(k,m) modulo d? Hmm, I need to recall.\n\nWait, in a cyclic group of order d, the subgroups are ordered by divisibility. The intersection of <a^m> and <a^n> would be the subgroup generated by a^l where l is the least common multiple of m and n in terms of exponents, but adjusted by the group order. Wait, perhaps I need to compute the exponent such that a^l is the generator of the intersection.\n\nAlternatively, let's use exponents. Let’s suppose that c is in the intersection, so c = a^{mx} = a^{ny}. Then, the exponent mx must be congruent to ny modulo d. So, mx ≡ ny mod d. Let’s denote this as mx - ny = d*q for some integer q.\n\nWe need to find an integer k such that mx = l*k, where l = lcm(m,n). If we can express mx as a multiple of l, then c = a^{l*k} is in <a^l>.\n\nBut how to show that mx is a multiple of l? Let's see. Since l = lcm(m,n), we can write l = m*m’ = n*n’ where m’ = l/m and n’ = l/n. Note that m’ and n’ are integers because l is a multiple of m and n.\n\nFrom mx = ny, we can substitute ny = mx. Let's divide both sides by m: x = (n/m)y. But m and n might not be coprime, so perhaps express m and n in terms of their gcd. Let’s let g = gcd(m,n), so m = g*m1, n = g*n1, where gcd(m1,n1) = 1. Then, l = lcm(m,n) = g*m1*n1.\n\nSo, substituting back, mx = g*m1*x and ny = g*n1*y. From mx = ny, we have g*m1*x = g*n1*y, which simplifies to m1*x = n1*y. Since m1 and n1 are coprime, m1 divides y and n1 divides x. Therefore, y = m1*k and x = n1*k for some integer k.\n\nTherefore, mx = g*m1*x = g*m1*(n1*k) = g*m1*n1*k = l*k. Hence, mx is equal to l*k, so c = a^{mx} = a^{l*k} which is in <a^l>. Therefore, the containment holds.\n\nAh, so in the finite case, using the gcd and lcm relationship, breaking m and n into their gcd and coprime parts allows us to factor out and show that the exponent is a multiple of lcm(m,n). Therefore, the user might have missed this step of expressing m and n in terms of their gcd and coprime components. This seems like a crucial part of the proof for the finite order case. The user's approach might have stumbled here because they didn't decompose m and n into gcd and co-prime factors, which helps in showing that x and y can be expressed in terms of a common k, leading to mx being a multiple of lcm(m,n).\n\nSo, summarizing, the key steps are:\n\n1. Let g = gcd(m,n), write m = g*m1, n = g*n1, with gcd(m1,n1) = 1.\n\n2. Then lcm(m,n) = g*m1*n1.\n\n3. From mx = ny, substitute m and n to get g*m1*x = g*n1*y ⇒ m1*x = n1*y.\n\n4. Since m1 and n1 are coprime, m1 divides y and n1 divides x, so y = m1*k, x = n1*k.\n\n5. Substitute back into mx to get mx = g*m1*(n1*k) = lcm(m,n)*k, hence c = a^{lcm(m,n)*k} ∈ <a^lcm(m,n)>.\n\nTherefore, the containment holds.\n\nThe user might not have considered expressing m and n in terms of their gcd and coprime parts, which is essential here. Also, recognizing that m1 and n1 being coprime allows one to conclude divisibility and hence express x and y in terms of a common k. This step is crucial in connecting mx and ny to lcm(m,n).",
