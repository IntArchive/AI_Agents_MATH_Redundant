    "Content": "I came across this interesting inequality, and was looking for interesting proofs. $x,y,z \\geq 0$ $$ 2\\sqrt{\\frac{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}}{3}}+3\\sqrt [3]{xyz}\\leq 5\\left(\\frac{x+y+z}{3}\\right) $$ Addendum.

    "AcceptedAnswer": "This is not a direct answer to the question, but it's probably too long for a comment, so I'm leaving it as an answer. (In the comments it seems that OP was not familiar with the technique of mixing variables/smoothing, which was used by Honey_S in the link provided to solve the problem; or the (n-1)-EV theorem, so this answer would be a quick exposition of what they are.) Mixing variables/smoothing: In inequalities such as $f(a,b,c) \\ge 0$, we seek to prove an inequality of the type $f(a,b,c) \\ge f(t,t,c)$. We expect to iterate this inequality so that we can conclude the minimum would be attained when many variables are equal. Example 1: (AM-GM inequality) We want to show that if $a,b,c > 0$, then $a+b+c \\ge 3(abc)^{1/3}$. Proof. Consider $f(a,b,c) = a + b + c - 3(abc)^{1/3}$ Now by 2-variable AM-GM, we see that $f(a,b,c) \\ge f(\\sqrt{ab}, \\sqrt{ab}, c)$. You can then imagine that if we keep on doing such smoothing - i.e. next time replace $(\\sqrt{ab}, c)$ with 2-tuple of their geometric mean for example, then in infinite time we reach the case where all three variables are equal, and that $f(a,b,c)$ attains its minimum when $a=b=c$, which is 0. In general there are many choices of $t$. If there's an initial condition on $a+b+c$, you may want to change $(a,b)$ to $\\left(\\frac{a+b}{2}, \\frac{a+b}{2} \\right)$ or sometimes $(0,a+b)$ if you guess that equality case of the inequality involves 0. If there is an initial condition on $a^2+b^2+c^2$, you may change $(a,b)$ to $\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{a^2+b^2}{2}}, \\sqrt{\\frac{a^2+b^2}{2}}\\right)$ etc. In the AM-GM example, life is nice because $f(a,b,c) \\ge f(t,t,c)$ holds unconditionally. Very often, this is not the case. For example, in Honey_S's solution in the link, after assuming $abc=1$ by homogenity he proved that $f(a,b,c) \\ge f(\\sqrt{ab},\\sqrt{ab},c)$ for $ f\\left({a,b,c}\\right) = 5\\left({a+b+c}\\right)-2\\sqrt{3\\left({a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}}\\right)} $ only when $c = \\max (a,b,c)$ . However in this case, we are left to show that $f(t,t,c) \\ge 0$ under the condition $t^2c = 1$. This is a one-variable inequality easily handled by calculus. If you want to see more examples of smoothing in action, check this thread and the four links in that post, this and this for example. (n-1)-EV theorem: This is a theorem that kills many olympiad inequalities. You can see Vasile Cirtoaje's original article here . Basically what it does is that after some tedious calculus checking, many inequalities actually attain its extremum when (n-1) of the n variables involved in the inequality are equal.(And we can use calculus to check the remaining case) Check out theorem 3 and its corollaries in the link. If you want to see its applications, see the \"Applications\" section of Vasc's paper, and if you want some more, see here or maybe a recent post on this forum. I hope this would be enough for you now :)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure the given problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. Let me start by reading the original problem carefully.\n\nThe title is \"Combined AM GM QM inequality\". The user presents an inequality involving variables x, y, z and asks for proofs. Then there's an addendum asking about a more general form of the inequality.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The original problem states that x, y, z are greater than or equal to 0. That's one assumption. Then, the problem presents a specific inequality with coefficients 2 and 3 on the left side and 5 on the right. The addendum generalizes this to coefficients a and b, so the general case would involve a and b as constants. However, the user is asking when the general inequality is true, which probably relates to conditions on a and b. \n\nWait, the original problem's addendum asks: \"In general, when is [the inequality] true?\" So, the assumptions for the general case might include the non-negativity of x, y, z, and some conditions on a and b. But the example provided in the user's initial message only lists assumptions about the variables (like n being an integer and divisible by 7), not the coefficients. In the example, the coefficients (5, 6, etc.) are part of the problem statement, not assumptions. So maybe in this case, the coefficients a and b are parameters to be considered in the problem, not assumptions. Therefore, the only explicit assumption from the user is that x, y, z are non-negative. The rest is part of the problem statement.\n\nSo for the specific problem, the assumptions are x, y, z ≥ 0. For the addendum, it's the same variables and the question about the conditions on a and b. But the user wants the problem structured, so the main problem is the first inequality, and the addendum is a follow-up question. However, the user's example included an assumption about n being an integer and divisible by 7, which was in the original problem but not stated in the title. So in this case, the assumptions should be the given conditions: x, y, z are non-negative. The problem is to prove the specific inequality and then the general case's conditions.\n\nWait, the user's example had the original problem stating that for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, they listed assumptions as n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so maybe that was a mistake in the example? Or perhaps the example was a modified version. Wait, let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem lists assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems contradictory. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. So maybe there was a mistake there. But regardless, the user wants me to follow the example's structure, which for the problem given, the user included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (the divisibility by 7). Wait, that can't be. Wait, no, the original problem in the example was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. However, 91 is 7*13. So perhaps the user in that example made a mistake in formatting, but I need to follow their structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the example had a typo. Let me check again:\n\nOriginal problem example: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems conflicting because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which would restrict n. That seems incorrect. Maybe the example is wrong? But the user provided that as their example, so I have to follow that structure regardless.\n\nTherefore, in the current problem, the original question states x, y, z >=0. So the assumptions should be that x, y, z are non-negative. Then the problem is to prove the inequality. The addendum asks about the general case with a and b, so for that part, the assumptions would still be x, y, z >=0, and the problem is to determine when the general inequality holds (i.e., for which a and b).\n\nBut the user's example included two separate assumptions (n is integer, n divisible by 7) even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n\". So perhaps in this case, the user wants me to list each condition as separate assumptions, even if they're part of the problem statement. Wait, but in the example, the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7; that was added as an assumption in the formatted problem. That seems like a mistake. Wait, no, looking at the example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut 91 is 7*13. So if n is divisible by 7, then perhaps the problem reduces to showing divisibility by 13, but that's not clear. Anyway, the example seems to have added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. So perhaps the user made a mistake in their example. But since the user provided that example, I need to follow their format, even if it's incorrect.\n\nTherefore, in the current problem, the user's original problem says x, y, z >=0. So the assumption is x, y, z are non-negative. But the example lists each assumption line by line, each addressing one property for one object. So I need to split x, y, z >=0 into three separate assumptions: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0, z ≥ 0. Each on a separate line.\n\nThen the problem is to prove the inequality 2√[(x²+y²+z²)/3] + 3∛(xyz) ≤5((x+y+z)/3). The addendum asks about the general case with a and b, so that would be a separate problem. But the user's instruction says to structure the problem as per the given format. The example included only the main problem, not the addendum. But the original problem here includes the addendum as part of the question. So do I include both as separate problems or combine them?\n\nIn the example, the user formatted the main problem, not the addendum. However, the current problem's addendum is part of the question. The user's example may have only included the main problem. But in the current case, the user asks \"Your task is to read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\"\n\nSo the question includes two parts: the specific inequality and the general case. However, the user's example only formatted the main problem. So perhaps I should structure both parts. But the format example only has one problem section. Alternatively, maybe the addendum is considered a separate problem. The user's instruction says \"structure that problem\" (singular), but the original question has two parts. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the addendum is part of the same problem, asking for when the general inequality holds. So perhaps the formatted problem should include both. But the example didn't include an addendum. Let me check the original user's example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem's assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But the original problem's conclusion was that it's divisible by 91 for every integer n. So there's inconsistency, but perhaps the example is incorrect. However, the user wants their current problem structured similarly.\n\nGiven that, perhaps for the current problem, the main problem is the first inequality, with assumptions x, y, z ≥0 each listed separately, and the problem is to prove the inequality. Then the addendum is a second problem, with the same assumptions, and the problem being to determine when the general inequality holds.\n\nBut the user's format example has only one problem section. However, the user's original question includes both parts. So perhaps we should structure them as two separate problems, but according to the user's example, which had only one problem. Alternatively, maybe the addendum is part of the same problem, so we include it in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants the main problem and the addendum as two separate formatted problems. But given the example provided, which only handled the main problem, I think the user expects the main problem and the addendum to be structured into two separate entries.\n\nBut the user's instruction says: \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" So perhaps the entire question, including the addendum, is considered one problem. However, the example only included one problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the addendum is a follow-up question, so it's part of the same problem. Let's see.\n\nIn the original problem, the user writes:\n\n\"I came across this interesting inequality, and was looking for interesting proofs. x,y,z ≥0 $$ 2\\sqrt{\\frac{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}}{3}}+3\\sqrt [3]{xyz}\\leq 5\\left(\\frac{x+y+z}{3}\\right) $$ Addendum. In general, when is $$ a\\sqrt{\\frac{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}}{3}}+b\\sqrt [3]{xyz}\\leq (a+b)\\left(\\frac{x+y+z}{3}\\right) $$ true?\"\n\nSo the main problem is to prove the specific inequality, and the addendum is a generalization, asking for conditions on a and b. So these are two related problems. The user might expect both to be formatted.\n\nBut according to the example, the formatted problem only included the main problem. So perhaps the user wants each part as a separate formatted problem. But given the instruction says \"structure that problem\" (singular), but the original question has two parts, I'm a bit confused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the addendum is considered part of the same problem. In that case, the problem would be to prove the first inequality and determine the conditions on a and b for the general case. But how to structure that.\n\nAlternatively, the user wants each part as a separate problem. The example only formatted the main problem, so perhaps only the first part is to be formatted here. But the addendum is part of the same question, so perhaps we need to include it.\n\nAlternatively, the user might want both parts in one problem statement. For example:\n\nAssumptions:\nx, y, z are non-negative,\na and b are real numbers.\n\nProblem:\nProve that for x, y, z ≥0,\n2√[(x²+y²+z²)/3] + 3∛(xyz) ≤5((x+y+z)/3),\nand determine for which a and b the general inequality\na√[(x²+y²+z²)/3] +b∛(xyz) ≤ (a+b)((x+y+z)/3)\nholds.\n\nBut the example separated the assumptions and problem. The example's assumptions were about the variables, not the coefficients. So in the current case, the coefficients 2,3,5 and a,b are part of the problem, not assumptions. Therefore, the assumptions are only about x,y,z.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nx is non-negative,\ny is non-negative,\nz is non-negative.\n\nProblem:\nProve that\n$$2\\sqrt{\\frac{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}}{3}}+3\\sqrt[3]{xyz}\\leq 5\\left(\\frac{x+y+z}{3}\\right)$$\nand determine when in general\n$$a\\sqrt{\\frac{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}}{3}}+b\\sqrt[3]{xyz}\\leq (a+b)\\left(\\frac{x+y+z}{3}\\right)$$\nis true.\n\nBut the example listed each assumption on a separate line. So x ≥0, y≥0, z≥0 as separate lines. Then the problem includes both parts. However, the example only had one problem statement, but here there are two parts. But perhaps the user wants both parts included in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the addendum is a separate problem. But given the original question includes both, I think they should be included together. So the problem is to prove the first inequality and determine conditions for the general case.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nx is non-negative,\ny is non-negative,\nz is non-negative.\n\nProblem:\nProve that\n$$2\\sqrt{\\frac{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}}{3}}+3\\sqrt[3]{xyz}\\leq 5\\left(\\frac{x+y+z}{3}\\right)$$\nand determine for which values of $a$ and $b$ the inequality\n$$a\\sqrt{\\frac{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}}{3}}+b\\sqrt[3]{xyz}\\leq (a+b)\\left(\\frac{x+y+z}{3}\\right)$$\nholds.\n\nBut the user's example had the problem as a single statement. Alternatively, maybe the addendum is a separate problem. But since it's part of the same question, perhaps it's included.\n\nAlternatively, the user might want two separate formatted entries. But the user's example didn't have that. Therefore, I'll proceed to structure the problem as including both parts in the problem statement, with assumptions listed as x, y, z each non-negative on separate lines.",
