    "AcceptedAnswer": "Write $X$ for your set of rational points union irrational points. Yes, every nonconstant path in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ hits $X$ . Note that any \"rational line\" $t\\mapsto (q_1 + q_2t, q_3 +  q_4t)$ (where $q_i \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\setminus\\{0\\}$ ) has image in $X$ . Assuming your path $\\gamma\\colon[0,1]\\to \\mathbb{R^2}$ is nonconstant, assume $\\gamma(a) \\neq \\gamma(b)$ . Then there is a rational line separating $\\gamma(a)$ and $\\gamma(b)$ , so by the intermediate value theorem, $\\gamma$ must hit that rational line, and must thereby hit $X$ . To produce such a rational line separating your two points $\\gamma(a)$ and $\\gamma(b)$ , choose close enough rational approximations for each point, then use the perpendicular bisector of the rational approximations.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. So, the user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to understand the original problem thoroughly.\n\nThe question is: \"Does every non-trivial path in the plane pass through either a rational point or an irrational point?\" More formally, it's asking if every path in ℝ² must go through a point that's either in ℚ×ℚ (both coordinates rational) or in 𝕀×𝕀 (both coordinates irrational). The user mentions their intuition says yes but they aren't sure how to prove it. They also added an edit saying this is equivalent to whether (ℚ×𝕀) ∪ (𝕀×ℚ) is totally path-disconnected, and the accepted answer shows a stronger statement.\n\nNow, the task is to format this into the Assumption and Problem sections as per the example. Let me recall the example given. The original problem was about proving a number is divisible by 91, and in the formatted version, assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then the problem statement followed.\n\nLooking at the current problem: The question is about paths in ℝ². The key elements here are:\n\n1. The path is non-trivial. But wait, the original problem says \"non-trivial path\". What does non-trivial mean here? Typically, in topology, a path is a continuous function from [0,1] to the space. A non-trivial path might mean that it's not a constant path, i.e., the function isn't constant. So the assumption here is that the path is non-constant. However, the user's original problem statement might just mean any path (since constant path is trivial, but maybe they consider all paths except constant ones). But the problem as stated in the title is \"non-trivial path\". So I need to check if that's part of the problem's assumption.\n\nWait, the title says \"Does every non-trivial path in the plane pass through...\", so the assumption is that the path is non-trivial. So in the assumptions, we need to list that the path is non-trivial. However, \"non-trivial\" needs to be defined. But in the context, the user might be considering a path as a continuous function γ: [0,1] → ℝ², and non-trivial meaning that it's not a constant path. So that's an assumption.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement in the formatted example didn't include all the definitions. For instance, in the example, the assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". So each assumption is a separate condition. Here, the first assumption would be that we have a path in ℝ², and the second that it's non-trivial (i.e., not constant). However, the term \"non-trivial\" might need to be clarified. Alternatively, maybe the problem is assuming the path is non-constant. But the original problem's title uses \"non-trivial\", so we should stick to that term. However, perhaps in the problem statement, the user uses \"non-trivial path\" but didn't specify what that means. But in the formatted problem, we need to list the assumptions. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe path is a continuous function from [0,1] to ℝ²,\nThe path is non-constant (i.e., not a trivial path).\n\nBut wait, maybe \"non-trivial\" here is part of the problem's conditions, so we need to list that. Alternatively, maybe the problem is stated as \"every non-trivial path...\" so the assumption is that the path is non-trivial. However, \"non-trivial\" could be ambiguous. The problem is from the user's question, which in the title says \"non-trivial path\". The body of the question says \"non-trivial path in the plane\", so maybe the assumption is that the path is non-constant. But since the user didn't explicitly define \"non-trivial\", perhaps in the formatted problem we need to clarify that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the term \"non-trivial\" is considered part of the problem statement, and the assumption is that the path is non-trivial (without defining it). But given that in the example, the assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\", which are specific conditions. So perhaps here, the assumptions are:\n\n- The path is a continuous function from [0,1] to ℝ² (since it's a path in the plane with Euclidean topology),\n- The path is non-constant (to exclude trivial paths).\n\nBut wait, the original problem's title says \"non-trivial path\", which is part of the problem statement. So maybe the problem is: \"Prove that every non-trivial path in ℝ² passes through a point of (ℚ×ℚ) ∪ (𝕀×𝕀).\" Then the assumptions would include that the path is non-trivial, but we need to define what that means. However, in the example provided, the assumptions are listed as separate conditions. For instance, in the example, the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the assumptions are that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the user had to restructure the problem to include the assumptions. Wait, looking at the example again:\n\nOriginal problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem's assumption lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be a mistake? Wait, maybe the example is not from the same problem. Let me check.\n\nThe example says:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That changes the problem. Maybe that example was a mistake, but according to the user's instruction, the task is to structure the problem by filtering unrelated information and listing assumptions. So perhaps in that example, the user made a mistake, but the correct approach is to list the assumptions from the problem. Wait, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", which is an assumption (n is integer). But the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". So perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the example is incorrect, but the user provided it as their own example. So perhaps the user intended that sometimes the problem may have hidden assumptions, and in the example, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, even though the original problem didn't state that. But that would be incorrect.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the example was a different case. Maybe the original problem had a typo, and the user corrected it by adding the assumption that n is divisible by 7 to make the problem correct. Because 91 is 7×13, and maybe the original problem had a mistake, and the formatted version fixed it by adding divisibility by 7. But this is speculation.\n\nBut regardless, according to the user's instruction, the task is to read the problem, filter unrelated information, and structure it into assumptions and problem. The example shows that assumptions are listed line by line, each being a single property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo, returning to the current problem: The problem is \"Does every non-trivial path in ℝ² pass through a point of (ℚ×ℚ) ∪ (𝕀×𝕀)?\" The user mentions the topology is Euclidean. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- The path is a continuous function from [0,1] to ℝ² (since a path in topology is typically a continuous function),\n- The path is non-constant (since non-trivial likely means non-constant),\n- The topology on ℝ² is Euclidean.\n\nBut the problem as stated in the title just says \"non-trivial path\", so maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- The path is non-trivial (but needs to define non-trivial as non-constant),\n- The topology on ℝ² is Euclidean.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes the reader knows what a path is (continuous), so the key assumption is that it's a non-constant path. However, in the example, the assumptions were explicit about n being an integer. So here, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The path is continuous,\n- The path is non-constant,\n- The topology on ℝ² is Euclidean.\n\nBut the original problem doesn't mention the topology in the title, but the question body does. The user wrote: \"The topology is the usual Euclidean.\" So that's an important condition. So the assumptions are:\n\n- The path is a continuous function in ℝ² with Euclidean topology,\n- The path is non-constant (non-trivial).\n\nThus, structuring:\n\nAssumption:\nThe path is a continuous function from [0,1] to ℝ²,\nThe path is non-constant (non-trivial),\nThe topology on ℝ² is Euclidean.\n\nProblem:\nProve that every non-trivial path in ℝ² passes through a point in (ℚ×ℚ) ∪ (𝕀×𝕀).\n\nBut wait, in the example, assumptions are listed as bullet points, each one addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So each assumption is a separate line.\n\nIn the original problem, the user wrote:\n\nOriginal problem's formatted version:\n\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut in the original problem, the user had \"for every integer n\", which would make the assumption \"n is an integer\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\", which changes the problem. That seems contradictory. Maybe the example is incorrect, but the user provided it as their own example. So perhaps the correct approach here is to list the assumptions that are given in the problem, not to add new ones. But in the example, the user added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. That suggests that perhaps the user made a mistake, but the instruction is to follow their example.\n\nWait, perhaps there was a misunderstanding. The original problem in the example might have been stated as \"Prove that for every integer n divisible by 7, A(n) is divisible by 91.\" Then the assumptions would be n is integer and n divisible by 7. But if the original problem was stated as \"for every integer n\", then adding the assumption that n is divisible by 7 would be incorrect. This is confusing.\n\nBut perhaps the example was a typo, and the user intended to show that assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. For the current problem, we need to extract the assumptions from the problem as presented.\n\nThe problem as given in the title and question is: Does every non-trivial path in ℝ² pass through a point in (ℚ×ℚ) ∪ (𝕀×𝕀)? The topology is Euclidean. The user mentions that the problem is equivalent to whether (ℚ×𝕀) ∪ (𝕀×ℚ) is totally path-disconnected.\n\nSo, assumptions:\n\n1. The path is a continuous function from [0,1] to ℝ² (since a path in topology is a continuous function).\n2. The path is non-trivial (which in this context means it's not a constant path; i.e., the function is not constant).\n3. The topology on ℝ² is the Euclidean topology.\n\nThese are the assumptions. Each is a separate condition. The problem is then to prove that such a path must pass through at least one point where both coordinates are rational or both are irrational.\n\nSo, formatted:\n\nAssumption:\nThe path is a continuous function from [0,1] to ℝ²,\nThe path is non-constant (non-trivial),\nThe topology on ℝ² is Euclidean.\n\nProblem:\nProve that every non-trivial path in ℝ² passes through a point in (ℚ × ℚ) ∪ (𝕀 × 𝕀).\n\nAlternatively, since \"non-trivial\" might be defined as non-constant, but the problem uses \"non-trivial path\", which may need to be clarified. However, in the example, the formatted problem kept the term \"for every integer n\" in the problem statement but listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So perhaps here, the problem statement would be \"Prove that every non-trivial path in ℝ²...\", and the assumption is that the path is non-trivial (non-constant).\n\nBut wait, the example's problem statement was \"Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" with assumption that n is integer and divisible by 7. So in that case, the problem statement in the formatted version doesn't include \"for every integer n\", because that's moved to assumptions. Similarly, here, the original problem is \"Does every non-trivial path...\" which would translate to the problem statement being \"Prove that every non-trivial path...\", and the assumptions being that the path is non-trivial, continuous, and in Euclidean topology. But perhaps the continuous part is inherent in the definition of a path. But in the example, they listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n\". So following that pattern, the assumption here would include that the path is a non-trivial path in ℝ² with Euclidean topology, but broken into separate assumptions.\n\nHmm. This is a bit confusing. Let's try to follow the example strictly.\n\nOriginal problem in example: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\"\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that's inconsistent. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. That changes the problem. Maybe the example is incorrect, but given that the user provided it, we have to follow their format.\n\nBut perhaps the example was supposed to extract hidden assumptions. For instance, maybe the divisibility by 91 requires n to be divisible by 7, but the original problem didn't state that. But that's speculative.\n\nIn any case, for the current problem, we need to structure it as per the user's example. The user's example seems to take the original problem's conditions and split them into assumptions, even if they were part of the problem statement. So if the problem is \"Prove that for every integer n...\", the assumption is \"n is an integer\". But in the example, they added \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original problem. So perhaps the user made a mistake in their example, but we need to follow the instruction to list all assumptions from the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the example is correct because the original problem had a mistake, and the formatted version corrects it by adding the missing assumption. For instance, maybe the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in reality, the statement is only true when n is divisible by 7. So the formatted problem corrects that by adding the assumption. But without knowing the context, it's hard to tell.\n\nIn any case, for the current problem, we need to read the Math Stack Exchange question and structure it.\n\nThe original question is: Does every non-trivial path in ℝ² pass through a point of (ℚ×ℚ) ∪ (𝕀×𝕀)? The topology is Euclidean. The user's edit mentions equivalence to another statement.\n\nSo to format this:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- The path is a continuous function from [0,1] to ℝ² (since it's a path in the plane with Euclidean topology).\n- The path is non-constant (non-trivial).\n- The topology on ℝ² is Euclidean.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that every non-trivial path in ℝ² passes through a point in (ℚ × ℚ) ∪ (𝕀 × 𝕀).\n\nAlternatively, if \"non-trivial\" is part of the problem statement, then the assumption is that the path is non-trivial, which we can define as non-constant.\n\nBut following the example, where the problem was originally \"for every integer n\", and the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, we can do similarly here. The original problem states \"every non-trivial path\", so the assumption is that the path is non-trivial. But we need to define non-trivial as non-constant. However, the example didn't define terms, just listed assumptions. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe path is a non-trivial (non-constant) continuous function from [0,1] to ℝ²,\nThe topology on ℝ² is Euclidean.\n\nBut splitting into separate lines:\n\nAssumption:\nThe path is a continuous function from [0,1] to ℝ²,\nThe path is non-trivial (non-constant),\nThe topology on ℝ² is Euclidean.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the path passes through a point in (ℚ × ℚ) ∪ (𝕀 × 𝕀).\n\nAlternatively, the problem statement can be as in the title: \"Prove that every non-trivial path in ℝ² passes through a point of (ℚ×ℚ) ∪ (𝕀×𝕀).\"\n\nBut in the example, the problem statement after formatting is \"Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91\", with assumptions listed separately. So similarly here, the problem would be \"Prove that every non-trivial path in ℝ² passes through...\", with assumptions listed.\n\nHowever, in the example, the original problem's \"for every integer n\" became an assumption, and the problem statement became just \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" So perhaps in our case, the problem statement should be \"Prove that the path passes through...\", with assumptions including that it's a non-trivial path in Euclidean topology.\n\nBut that would change the original problem's structure. The original problem is a universal statement: \"Does every non-trivial path...\" which is equivalent to \"Prove that every non-trivial path...\". So in the formatted version, the problem would be \"Prove that every non-trivial path...\", and the assumptions are that the path is non-trivial, continuous, and the topology is Euclidean. But since the problem statement includes \"every non-trivial path\", the assumptions would include the properties of such paths.\n\nBut following the example, where the universal quantifier \"for every integer n\" was moved into assumptions as \"n is an integer\", perhaps here, the problem statement becomes \"Prove that the path passes through...\", and the assumptions are:\n\n- The path is a non-trivial (non-constant) continuous function from [0,1] to ℝ²,\n- The topology on ℝ² is Euclidean.\n\nBut I think the user's example might have had an error, but we have to proceed as best as we can.\n\nGiven that, the correct formatting would likely be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe path is a continuous function from [0,1] to ℝ²,\nThe path is non-constant (non-trivial),\nThe topology on ℝ² is Euclidean.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the path passes through a point in (ℚ × ℚ) ∪ (𝕀 × 𝕀).\n\nThis way, the assumptions list the conditions on the path and the topology, and the problem is to prove the specific property. However, the original problem is about \"every non-trivial path\", so universal quantification. In the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", which became an assumption \"n is an integer\", and the problem statement became to prove divisibility by 91. So similarly here, \"every non-trivial path\" would translate to assuming that the path is non-trivial (and continuous, in Euclidean topology), and the problem is to prove it passes through the required point.\n\nAnother approach: The original problem is a yes/no question: \"Does every non-trivial path...\" So to convert it into a prove/disprove format, the problem would be \"Prove or disprove: Every non-trivial path...\" But the user's example turned a \"prove for every integer n\" into a problem statement without the universal quantifier, moving the quantifier into assumptions. So perhaps here, the problem statement is \"Prove that the path passes through...\", with the assumptions including that it's a non-trivial path (continuous, non-constant, Euclidean topology).\n\nIn summary, after considering all this, the formatted problem should have assumptions detailing the properties of the path and the topology, and the problem is to prove the stated property.",
