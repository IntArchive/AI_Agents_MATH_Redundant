    "AcceptedAnswer": "With suggestions of @barak manos and @ Alqatrkapa I Noted that I can improve my post. Notice that $2+2\\sqrt{28n^2+1}$ is an even integer. Also, $28n^2+1$ is a perfect square of an odd integer say $m$ (Because $28n^2+1$ is odd itself). Now, $$28n^2=m^2-1=(m+1)(m-1)\\implies 7n^2=(\\frac{m+1}{2})(\\frac{m-1}{2})$$ Hence, $(\\frac{m+1}{2})=7a^2$,$(\\frac{m-1}{2})=b^2$ or  $(\\frac{m+1}{2})=b^2$, $(\\frac{m-1}{2})=7a^2$. This is because $7n^2$ is $7$ times of a square and thus the right side is also $7$ times a perfect square. This is only possible when one of them is $7$ times of a square and other is simply a square as  $(Square * Square=Square)$, you can say that there is possibility that they both are not squares but the product is (like $2*8=16=4^2$), but notice that $(\\frac{m+1}{2})$ and $(\\frac{m-1}{2})$ are consecutive integers and hence coprime If $\\frac{m+1}{2}=7a^2$ and $\\frac{m-1}{2}=b^2$ then $b^2\\equiv-1\\mod (7)$, a contradiction. Hence, $\\frac{m-1}{2}=7a^2$ and $\\frac{m+1}{2}=b^2$. Hence, $2+2m=4b^2$ a perfect square.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to show that if \\(2 + 2\\sqrt{28n^2 + 1}\\) is an integer, then it must be a perfect square. Hmm, first, let's parse the problem correctly. The question states that \\(n\\) is an integer, and given that expression is an integer, we need to prove it's a perfect square.\n\nAlright, so the main assumptions here are that \\(n\\) is an integer and that the expression \\(2 + 2\\sqrt{28n^2 + 1}\\) is also an integer. The goal is to show that this expression is a perfect square. \n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Since the expression involves a square root, maybe we can set that radical part equal to some integer. Let's denote \\(k = \\sqrt{28n^2 + 1}\\). If the entire expression is an integer, then \\(k\\) must be rational because it's multiplied by 2 and added to 2, which are integers. But since \\(k\\) is a square root of an integer, if it's rational, it must actually be an integer. So \\(k\\) has to be an integer. Therefore, \\(28n^2 + 1\\) must be a perfect square. Let's write that as \\(28n^2 + 1 = m^2\\) where \\(m\\) is an integer. So now we have a Pell-type equation: \\(m^2 - 28n^2 = 1\\). \n\nWait, Pell equations usually have the form \\(x^2 - Dy^2 = N\\). Here, D is 28 and N is 1. The solutions to this equation are related to continued fractions of \\(\\sqrt{28}\\), but maybe we don't need to go that deep. Since the problem is about the expression \\(2 + 2m\\) being a perfect square, given that \\(m\\) comes from this Pell equation. So the original expression becomes \\(2 + 2m\\), and we need to show that this is a perfect square. So let's set \\(2 + 2m = t^2\\), where \\(t\\) is an integer. Then, simplifying, we get \\(m = \\frac{t^2}{2} - 1\\). But \\(m\\) must be an integer, so \\(\\frac{t^2}{2} - 1\\) must be integer. That implies that \\(t^2\\) is even, hence \\(t\\) must be even. Let \\(t = 2s\\), then \\(t^2 = 4s^2\\), so \\(m = \\frac{4s^2}{2} - 1 = 2s^2 - 1\\). \n\nNow, substitute back into the Pell equation: \\(m^2 - 28n^2 = 1\\). Plugging \\(m = 2s^2 - 1\\), we get \\((2s^2 - 1)^2 - 28n^2 = 1\\). Expanding the left side: \\(4s^4 - 4s^2 + 1 - 28n^2 = 1\\). Simplify: \\(4s^4 - 4s^2 - 28n^2 = 0\\). Divide both sides by 4: \\(s^4 - s^2 - 7n^2 = 0\\). Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe there's another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's start from the original expression. Let’s denote \\(x = 2 + 2\\sqrt{28n^2 + 1}\\). Since \\(x\\) is given to be an integer, let's isolate the square root: \\(\\sqrt{28n^2 + 1} = \\frac{x - 2}{2}\\). Then, squaring both sides: \\(28n^2 + 1 = \\left( \\frac{x - 2}{2} \\right)^2\\). Multiply both sides by 4: \\(112n^2 + 4 = (x - 2)^2\\). Rearranging: \\((x - 2)^2 - 112n^2 = 4\\). Let’s write this as \\((x - 2)^2 - 112n^2 = 4\\). This looks like a Pell-type equation as well, but with a 4 on the right. Maybe we can factor out a 4? Let’s see: Maybe not directly. Alternatively, divide both sides by 4: \\(\\left(\\frac{x - 2}{2}\\right)^2 - 28n^2 = 1\\). Let’s set \\(y = \\frac{x - 2}{2}\\), so the equation becomes \\(y^2 - 28n^2 = 1\\). Ah, now we have the Pell equation \\(y^2 - 28n^2 = 1\\). So the solutions for \\(y\\) and \\(n\\) correspond to the fundamental solutions of this Pell equation. \n\nThe minimal solution for Pell equations gives the smallest non-trivial solution. For \\(D = 28\\), the continued fraction expansion of \\(\\sqrt{28}\\) is periodic, and the minimal solution can be found. Let me recall that the minimal solution for Pell equations can sometimes be found by testing small integers. Let's try small values of \\(n\\):\n\nWhen \\(n = 1\\): \\(y^2 = 28(1)^2 + 1 = 29\\). Not a square.\n\n\\(n = 2\\): \\(y^2 = 28(4) + 1 = 113\\). Not a square.\n\n\\(n = 3\\): \\(28*9 +1=253\\). Not square.\n\n\\(n=4\\): 28*16 +1=449. Not square.\n\n\\(n=5\\): 28*25+1=701. Not square.\n\nHmm, this might not be the way to go. Alternatively, maybe look at the minimal solution for the Pell equation \\(y^2 - 28n^2 = 1\\). The fundamental solution for D=28 can be found using continued fractions. Alternatively, recall that for Pell equations, solutions can be generated once the minimal solution is known. The minimal solution for D=28 is (y, n) = (127, 24). Because 127^2 - 28*24^2 = 16129 - 28*576 = 16129 - 16128 = 1. So that's the minimal solution.\n\nSo, if \\(y = 127\\), then \\(x = 2 + 2y = 2 + 254 = 256 = 16^2\\). Which is a perfect square. The next solution can be generated by \\(y + n\\sqrt{28} = (127 + 24\\sqrt{28})^k\\) for k = 1,2,3,... So for k=2: (127 + 24√28)^2 = 127^2 + 2*127*24√28 + (24√28)^2 = 16129 + 6096√28 + 24^2*28 = 16129 + 6096√28 + 576*28 = 16129 + 6096√28 + 16128 = (16129 + 16128) + 6096√28 = 32257 + 6096√28. So the next solution is y = 32257, n = 6096. Then x = 2 + 2y = 2 + 64514 = 64516. Is this a perfect square? Let's check sqrt(64516). 254^2 = 64516, since 250^2=62500, 254^2=62500 + 800 + 16 = 62500 + 816 = 63316? Wait, no. Wait 254^2: (250 + 4)^2 = 250^2 + 2*250*4 + 4^2 = 62500 + 2000 + 16 = 64516. Yes, so 254^2. So indeed, x=254^2. Similarly, all solutions for x will be perfect squares.\n\nTherefore, the expression \\(2 + 2\\sqrt{28n^2 +1}\\) being integer implies that it's a perfect square. Hence, the problem's conclusion holds.\n\nBut how to structure this in the required format? The original question has the assumption that n is an integer and that 2 + 2√(28n² +1) is an integer. The problem is to show that this integer is a perfect square.\n\nSo in the Assumption part, we need to list each assumption line by line. The first assumption is that n is an integer. The second assumption is that the expression 2 + 2√(28n² +1) is an integer. Each assumption is applied to one object. Then the problem is to prove that this expression is a perfect square.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\n2 + 2√(28n² +1) is an integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that 2 + 2√(28n² +1) is a perfect square.\n\nWait, but in the example given, the user structured the problem with the assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. In the original problem here, the assumption is n is an integer, and the expression is an integer. So both are separate assumptions. Therefore, the correct formatting would be two assumptions: one for n being integer, another for the expression being integer. Then the problem is to prove it's a perfect square.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the assumptions are about n and about the expression. Each on their own line.",
