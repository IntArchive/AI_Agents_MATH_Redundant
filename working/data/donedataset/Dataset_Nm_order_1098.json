    "AcceptedAnswer": "Hint: Try induction on $n$. The base case is clear; in the inductive step, we will want to start with a degree $n+1$ polynomial $f$, and somehow reduce to the case of a degree $\\leq n$ polynomial. There are two cases: $f$ is irreducible, and $f$ is reducible. Suppose $f$ is reducible. Let $p$ be an irreducible factor of $f$, so that $1\\leq \\deg(p)\\leq n$, and let $L$ be the splitting field of $p$ over $F$. Then $K$ is the splitting field of $\\frac{f}{p}$ over $L$, and $\\deg(\\frac{f}{p})=\\deg(f)-\\deg(p)$. Note that $a!\\times b!$ always divides $(a+b)!$  (this is equivalent to the binomial coefficients being integers). Suppose $f$ is irreducible. Then letting $L=F[x]/(f)\\cong F(\\alpha)$ for some root $\\alpha$ of $f$, we have that $[L:F]=n+1$. Now consider $\\frac{f}{x-\\alpha}$ (which is of degree $n$) as a polynomial over $L$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The problem is about proving that the degree of a splitting field extension divides n!. I know that the splitting field K of a polynomial f(x) over F is the smallest field where f splits into linear factors. The degree [K:F] is the dimension of K as an F-vector space. \n\nFirst, I remember that the degree of the splitting field is related to the Galois group, but maybe I don't need Galois theory here. The user mentioned they only know that [K:F] ≤ n! and want to show it divides n!. Hmm. So, how does the degree relate to the factorial?\n\nWait, when you have a polynomial of degree n, the splitting field can be constructed by adjoining all the roots. Each time you adjoin a root, the degree of the extension might multiply by the degree of the minimal polynomial of that root over the previous field. But since the polynomial splits into linear factors in the splitting field, each minimal polynomial after the first root would maybe have degree less than or equal to n-1, then n-2, etc. So the total degree would be a product of these degrees, each dividing the remaining number of factors. So the total product would divide n! because it's the product of numbers each less than or equal to n, but possibly with some multiplicities. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Galois group of the splitting field is a subgroup of S_n, the symmetric group on n elements. Then the order of the Galois group, which is [K:F] if the extension is Galois, would divide n! by Lagrange's theorem. But wait, does this require the extension to be Galois? The problem doesn't state that f is separable, so maybe K/F isn't necessarily Galois. Hmm, so maybe that approach isn't general enough.\n\nBut the problem statement just says \"polynomial\", not necessarily separable. So perhaps the Galois group approach isn't the right way here. Maybe there's another approach using induction or the tower law.\n\nLet me think again. For a polynomial f of degree n, the splitting field K is obtained by adjoining roots one by one. Suppose the roots are α1, α2, ..., αn. Then K = F(α1, α2, ..., αn). Each time you adjoin a root, the degree of the extension could multiply by a number that's at most the remaining number of roots. For example, when you adjoin α1, the minimal polynomial of α1 over F divides f(x), so [F(α1):F] ≤ n. Then, over F(α1), the polynomial f(x) factors as (x - α1)g(x), where g is degree n-1. Then adjoining α2 over F(α1) would have degree ≤ n-1, and so on. So the total degree [K:F] would be ≤ n(n-1)(n-2)...1 = n! which matches the known result. But the problem is to show that [K:F] divides n!.\n\nWait, but the product of the degrees of each extension step would be the total degree [K:F]. Each of these degrees is ≤ the number of roots remaining, but how does that product divide n!? Maybe each step's degree divides some number, and the product divides n!?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the order of the automorphism group Aut(K/F) divides n!, and if the extension is Galois, then [K:F] = |Aut(K/F)|, hence divides n!. But again, if the extension isn't Galois, then [K:F] might not equal the order of the automorphism group. So this approach might not work.\n\nWait, but maybe even if the extension isn't Galois, the degree [K:F] divides n! because the automorphism group still injects into S_n, hence its order divides n!, and if the extension is separable, then [K:F] equals the order of the automorphism group. But if it's not separable, then [K:F] could be larger? But in characteristic 0, all extensions are separable. The problem doesn't specify the field F. So maybe the problem is assuming characteristic 0? Or maybe not. The original problem just says \"Let f(x) ∈ F[x] be a polynomial of degree n\". So maybe in general, even in positive characteristic, the result holds.\n\nHmm, maybe I need another approach. Let's consider the tower of fields. Let K be the splitting field. Then K is generated by all roots of f. Let’s say f factors as (x - α1)...(x - αn) in K. Then K = F(α1, ..., αn). We can build K by successively adjoining each root. The degree [F(α1):F] divides n! because it's at most n. Then, over F(α1), the polynomial splits into (x - α1) and a polynomial of degree n-1. Then [F(α1, α2):F(α1)] divides (n-1), so the total degree up to this point divides n(n-1). Continuing this way, each step's degree divides the remaining number of roots. So the total degree would divide n!.\n\nWait, but is that accurate? Suppose when you adjoin α1, the minimal polynomial has degree d1 ≤ n. Then, after adjoining α1, the next minimal polynomial over F(α1) for α2 would have degree d2 ≤ n-1, since α2 is a root of f(x)/(x - α1). But even if f is irreducible, once you adjoin one root, the others might have lower degree minimal polynomials. So each step multiplies the degree by something that divides the remaining factorial term. Hence, the total degree would divide n!.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's rigorous. Maybe induction would work. For n=1, the splitting field is F itself, so [K:F] =1 divides 1!.\n\nAssume for all polynomials of degree less than n, the splitting field has degree dividing (n-1)!.\n\nTake a polynomial of degree n. Let α be a root. Then [F(α):F] = d divides n (since d is the degree of the minimal polynomial of α). Then, over F(α), the polynomial f splits into (x - α)g(x), where g is degree n-1. The splitting field of g over F(α) would have degree dividing (n-1)! by induction. So the total degree [K:F] = [F(α):F][K:F(α)] divides n*(n-1)! = n!.\n\nTherefore, by induction, [K:F] divides n!.\n\nWait, but does this hold? Because when you adjoin α, the minimal polynomial degree d divides n, and then the splitting field of g over F(α) would have degree dividing (n-1)! by induction. So the total degree would be d * something dividing (n-1)!, hence the product divides n * (n-1)! = n!.\n\nYes, this seems correct. Therefore, induction works. So the key steps are using induction and the tower law. Each time you adjoin a root, the degree extension divides the remaining factorial term, so the product divides n!.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that by induction on the degree of the polynomial, using the tower of fields and the fact that the degree of each extension step divides the remaining factorial term, hence the total degree divides n!.",
