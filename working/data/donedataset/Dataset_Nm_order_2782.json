    "Content": "Let n be an odd integer. In some field, n gunmen are placed such that all pairwise distances between them are different. At a signal, every gunman takes out his gun and shoots the closest gunman. Prove the following: a) At least one gunman survives. b) No gunman is shot more than 5 times. c) The trajectory of the bullets does not intersect. I solved part A with the extremal principle, however, I think it lacks rigour.(I  will be posting my solution shortly.) I would appreciate a rigorous one or an alternate solution. I am clueless when it comes to part B. Solved part C with some geometry, just thought that I should share it anyway. EDITS:\nPart C is solved with the theorem: In a triangle, sides opposite to larger angles are longer. Suppose A $\\rightarrow$ C and B$\\rightarrow$D and their trajectories intersect, this implies four inequalities with the sides and diagonals of $ABCD$. And with the above theorem we prove that the sum of the angles is $<360$. Contradiction. EDIT 2: The best solutions seem to be from Maciek for Part B and Micah for part A. Since Maciek has enough upvotes and will stay at the top of the feed, I have \"accepted\" Micah's answer.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Another version of a): By the pigeonhole principle, \"someone doesn't get shot\" is equivalent to \"someone gets shot twice\" whenever $n > 1$. Consider the two gunmen who are closest together. They will shoot each other. If anyone else shoots them, we're done; if not, remove them and induct. More formally: We'll proceed by induction. If $n=1$, the gunman survives. Now, let $n>1$ be odd, and suppose that someone survives in every configuration involving $k<n$ gunmen with $k$. Take a configuration involving $n$ gunmen, and consider the two gunmen who are closest together. They will shoot each other. If anyone else shoots them, then one of them is being shot twice, and thus by the pigeonhole principle there must be some other gunman who isn't being shot at all. If nobody else shoots them, we can remove them from the field without affecting whom anybody else is shooting. This will give a configuration involving $n-2$ gunmen, which is an odd number; thus, by the induction hypothesis, at least one of those gunmen will survive. In either case, we have shown that there is a surviving gunman, so this completes the proof.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this problem step by step. The user provided an example and wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The problem is about n gunmen in a field where all pairwise distances are different. The tasks are to prove three parts: a) at least one survives, b) no one is shot more than 5 times, c) bullet trajectories don't intersect. The user mentions they solved part A but want a rigorous solution, are stuck on B, and solved C with some geometry. There are edits where they explain part C's solution using a theorem about triangles and angles leading to a contradiction. Also, they mention accepting answers from Maciek and Micah.\n\nNow, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem. The example given in the instruction was about divisibility, so assumptions there were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. For the current problem, the key assumptions are:\n\n- n is an odd integer. (Stated in the title and question)\n- All pairwise distances between the gunmen are different. (From the question)\n\nEach assumption should be one line, each addressing one property applied to one object. The problem parts a, b, c are all part of the same original problem, but the user wants each part formatted as a separate problem? Wait, looking at the example, the original problem had multiple parts but the formatted version only included the problem statement as given. Wait, in the example, the user had the original problem as proving divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem included the same, even though the original might have had more context. \n\nIn the current case, the user's problem has parts a, b, c. But in the example, the formatted problem included the entire problem statement. Wait, the example's original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, but the user's formatted problem included the same statement, even though the original mentioned that n is an integer. But in the example, the assumption listed n is an integer and n divisible by 7, but the problem statement in the formatted version was just \"Prove that A(n)... is divisible by 91.\" So perhaps the assumptions are the conditions given, and the problem is the actual thing to prove.\n\nIn the current case, the problem is split into parts a, b, c. But the instructions say to structure the problem as per the format. The example included the problem as the original statement. So perhaps here, the problem should be the three parts as given. However, the user might want each part as a separate problem? But the example includes the entire problem statement. Let me check the user's instruction again:\n\n\"Structure that problem as the following format. You will be given some example which I structured before.\"\n\nThe example included the problem statement as is, with the assumptions listed. So for this case, the problem should include all three parts (a, b, c) as they are part of the same original problem. The assumptions would be n is an odd integer, and all pairwise distances are different. Then the problem is to prove the three parts. \n\nBut wait, in the original question, the user wrote \"Prove the following: a)... b)... c)...\" So the problem includes all three parts. So in the formatted version, the assumptions should list:\n\n1. n is an odd integer.\n2. All pairwise distances between the gunmen are different.\n\nThen the problem is: Prove the following: a) At least one gunman survives. b) No gunman is shot more than 5 times. c) The trajectory of the bullets does not intersect.\n\nBut the example had the problem as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" which was the original question. So here, the problem is the entire three-part question. The user's edits and mentions of solving parts are extra context but not part of the problem itself, so those should be filtered out. \n\nSo the final formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an odd integer,\nAll pairwise distances between n gunmen are different.\n\nProblem:\nProve the following: a) At least one gunman survives. b) No gunman is shot more than 5 times. c) The trajectory of the bullets does not intersect.\n\nYes, that seems right. The key is to filter out the unrelated information like the user's comments about their solutions, the edits, mentions of other answers, etc., and focus on the core problem and its assumptions.",
