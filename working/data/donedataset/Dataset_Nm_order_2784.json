    "Content": "Question is to prove that $(\\mathbb{Z}/2^n \\mathbb{Z})^*$ is not a  cyclic group for $n\\geq 3$ . Hint : Find two subgroups of order $2$ . I somehow feel that a cyclic group can not have two distinct groups of same order. but, I am not sure about the proof. I have no idea how to proceed for this. any hint would be appreciated. Thank You.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Follow this outline: $5$ has order $m=2^{n-2}$. For a proof, see https://math.stackexchange.com/a/74086/589 . $5^r$ and $-5^r$ for $r=2^{n-3}$ generate different subgroups of order $2$. If you only want to prove that $(\\mathbb{Z}/2^n \\mathbb{Z})^*$ is not cyclic, it is enough to prove that no element can have order $2^{n-1}$. For a proof, see How to prove by induction that $a^{2^{k-2}} \\equiv 1\\pmod {2^k}$ for odd $a$? .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let me try to work through this problem. The goal is to prove that the multiplicative group of integers modulo 2^n, denoted (Z/2^n Z)^*, is not cyclic for n ≥ 3. The hint suggests finding two subgroups of order 2. \n\nFirst, I need to recall some group theory basics. A cyclic group is a group that can be generated by a single element. If a group has two distinct subgroups of the same order, especially of order 2, that might imply it's not cyclic because in a cyclic group, there's exactly one subgroup of each order dividing the group's order. So if we can find two different subgroups of order 2, that would show the group isn't cyclic.\n\nNow, let's think about (Z/2^n Z)^*. The elements of this group are the integers modulo 2^n that are coprime to 2^n. Since 2^n is a power of 2, the coprime integers are the odd ones from 1 to 2^n - 1. So the order of the group is φ(2^n) = 2^(n) - 2^(n-1) = 2^(n-1). So the group has order 2^(n-1). \n\nFor n ≥ 3, 2^(n-1) is at least 4. If the group were cyclic, then its structure would be isomorphic to Z/(2^(n-1))Z. But we need to check if that's actually the case. However, the problem states it's not cyclic, so there must be a reason.\n\nThe hint says to find two subgroups of order 2. In group theory terms, a subgroup of order 2 must consist of the identity element and another element of order 2. So, we need to find two distinct elements of order 2 in (Z/2^n Z)^*. \n\nLet's consider specific elements. Let's take n=3 first as an example. Then 2^3=8, so the group (Z/8Z)^* has elements {1, 3, 5, 7}. Each of these elements squared modulo 8: 3²=9≡1 mod8, 5²=25≡1 mod8, 7²=49≡1 mod8. So all elements except 1 have order 2. Therefore, there are three elements of order 2, which would generate three different subgroups of order 2. But wait, in this case, the group is actually isomorphic to the Klein four-group, which is not cyclic. So for n=3, it's already not cyclic. \n\nFor higher n, like n=4, 2^4=16. The group (Z/16Z)^* has φ(16)=8 elements: {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15}. Let's check the orders. Let's compute 3^2=9 mod16, 3^4=81≡1 mod16. So order of 3 is 4. Similarly, 5^2=25≡9 mod16, 5^4=81≡1 mod16, so order 4. What about -1 mod16, which is 15. 15^2=225≡1 mod16. So 15 has order 2. Similarly, 7^2=49≡1 mod16, so 7 has order 2. Wait, so in (Z/16Z)^*, elements 7 and 15 both have order 2, each generating a subgroup of order 2. Therefore, there are at least two distinct subgroups of order 2, which would imply the group is not cyclic. Because in a cyclic group of order 8, there's exactly one subgroup of order 2. \n\nSo in general, for n ≥ 3, in (Z/2^n Z)^*, we can find elements like -1 (which is 2^n -1) and 1 + 2^(n-1). Let's check if these have order 2. Let's take 2^n -1. Squaring it: (2^n -1)^2 = 2^(2n) - 2^(n+1) +1 ≡ 1 mod2^n because 2^(2n) and 2^(n+1) are multiples of 2^n for n ≥1. Similarly, 1 + 2^(n-1): squaring gives 1 + 2*2^(n-1) + 2^(2n-2). For n ≥3, 2n-2 ≥n+1 (since n ≥3, 2n-2=4 when n=3, which is greater than 4? Wait, for n=3, 2n-2=4, and 2^4=16, mod8=0. So (1 + 2^(n-1))² ≡1 + 2*2^(n-1) mod2^n. But 2*2^(n-1)=2^n, which is 0 mod2^n. Therefore, (1 + 2^(n-1))² ≡1 mod2^n. So both elements 2^n -1 and 1 + 2^(n-1) have order 2. Are they distinct? For n ≥3, 2^n -1 is not equal to 1 + 2^(n-1). Let's check for n=3: 8-1=7 vs 1+4=5. Yes, distinct. For n=4: 16-1=15 vs 1+8=9. Also distinct. So these are two distinct elements of order 2, generating two distinct subgroups of order 2. Hence, the group can't be cyclic because cyclic groups have exactly one subgroup of each order dividing the group's order.\n\nTherefore, the key assumptions are that n is at least 3, and that we can find these two distinct elements of order 2. The problem then is to show that under these assumptions, the group isn't cyclic by demonstrating the existence of two subgroups of order 2.",
