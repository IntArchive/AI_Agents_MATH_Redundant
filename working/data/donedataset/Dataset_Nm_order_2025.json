    "Content": "Let $Y$ be a non-negative random variable. Prove that $E(Y) = 0$ if and only if $P(Y=0)=1$ . My understanding is that while you can prove it for discrete $Y$ , the result is true for all $Y$ .",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If $Y$ is a non-negative random variable defined on a probability space $\\Omega$ and $$E(Y) = \\int_{\\Omega} Y dP=0$$ then $Y = 0$ almost surely and $P(\\{\\omega \\in \\Omega: Y(\\omega)=0\\})=1$ . Proof: For any $m \\in \\mathbf{N}$ , let $$E_m = \\{\\omega \\in \\Omega:Y(\\omega) > 1/m\\}$$ then, since $Y$ is non-negative, we have $Y = Y1_{\\Omega} \\geq Y 1_{E_m}$ and then $$0 = \\int_{\\Omega} Y dP \\geq \\int_{E_m} Y dP\\geq \\frac1{m}P(E_m) \\geq 0,$$ and $P(E_m) = 0$ . So $$0 \\leq P(\\{\\omega \\in \\Omega:Y(\\omega) \\neq 0\\})= P\\left(\\bigcup E_m\\right) = \\lim_{m \\rightarrow \\infty}P(E_m)=0$$ Hence $$P(\\{\\omega \\in \\Omega:Y(\\omega) \\neq 0\\})=0 \\implies P(\\{\\omega \\in \\Omega:Y(\\omega) = 0\\})=1 $$ QED Conversely, if $Y=0$ a.s. then $E(Y) = \\int Y dP = 0$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to format this problem according to the user's guidelines. The original question is about proving that a nonnegative random variable has zero expectation if and only if it is zero almost surely. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The problem states that Y is a non-negative random variable. So the first assumption is that Y is non-negative. Then, there are two parts to the problem: proving that E(Y) = 0 implies P(Y=0) = 1, and conversely, that if P(Y=0) = 1, then E(Y) = 0. However, in the example given, the assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property. Here, the main assumptions are Y is a random variable and Y is non-negative. The problem is the equivalence of E(Y)=0 and P(Y=0)=1. Wait, but the original problem doesn't have more assumptions, just Y is non-negative. So in the Assumption section, each line should be a single condition. Let me check the example again. In the example, the user listed two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in the original problem here, the only assumption given is that Y is a non-negative random variable. However, the problem is about the equivalence, so maybe the two directions are part of the problem statement. But according to the user's format, assumptions are the given conditions. So perhaps the only assumption here is that Y is a non-negative random variable. Then the problem is to prove the equivalence. Let me structure that.\n\nAssumption:\nY is a non-negative random variable.\n\nProblem:\nProve that E(Y) = 0 if and only if P(Y = 0) = 1.\n\nWait, but the original question mentions \"the result is true for all Y\". However, the problem is specifically about non-negative Y, as stated in the first sentence. So the assumption is indeed Y is non-negative. The rest is the problem statement. Therefore, the formatted version should have that assumption and the problem as stated.",
