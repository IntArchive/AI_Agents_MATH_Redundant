    "Content": "A few months ago, while at school, my classmate asked me this curious question: What does $\\frac{x^{n}-y^{n}}{n}$ tend to as $n$ tends to $0$? I thought for a few minutes, became impatient, and asked \"What?\" His reply, log$\\frac{x}{y}$, was surprising, but his purported 'proof' was more surprising: Consider $\\lim\\limits_{n \\to 0}\\,\\int_y^x t^{n-1}\\, dt$. \"Pushing the limit into the definite integral\", we have $$\\int_y^x \\lim\\limits_{n \\to 0}\\,t^{n-1}\\, dt \\implies \\int_y^x \\frac{1}{t}\\, dt \\implies \\mathsf{log} \\frac{x}{y}$$ Leaving the fact that he had the inspiration to pull this integral out of thin air aside, is the limit allowed to pass into the definite integral? We hadn't learned Real Analysis (we were just taking a basic high school, hand-wavy single-variable calculus course), and I remember feeling very uneasy about the sorcery. I still am, hence, this question. I've since thought about approaching it using $\\mathsf{L'Hospital}$, but I still feel uneasy, since it involves differentiating with respect to different variables, which is a little bit confusing. I'd also appreciate your help in this regard. If you have a better proof, I'll truly appreciate it.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "See here: Can a limit of an integral be moved inside the integral? In general, passing the limit under the integral is not valid. In this circumstance, however, it is valid, as the functions converge uniformly on a finite interval. Uniform convergence means the following: if we let $M_n = \\max\\limits_{y\\le t\\le x}{|t^{n-1}-t^{-1}|}$ be the maximum difference of $t^{n-1}$ from $t^{-1}$, then $\\lim\\limits_{n\\rightarrow 0}{M_n} = 0$. You can check that uniform convergence does hold here, so by a standard (and fairly easy to prove) theorem of analysis, passing the limit under the integral is justified.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. The user wants the limit as n approaches 0 of (x^n - y^n)/n, and they claim it's equal to log(x/y). Hmm, first, I need to verify if this is true and then figure out the proper way to prove it. The original question mentions using an integral approach by considering the integral from y to x of t^(n-1) dt and then swapping the limit and the integral. But the user is uneasy about that method because swapping limits and integrals isn't something they've covered rigorously.\n\nLet me start by recalling some calculus concepts. When can you interchange a limit and an integral? I remember that if the integrand converges uniformly on the interval, then you can interchange them. But since this is a high school level question, maybe there's a simpler way without invoking uniform convergence. Alternatively, maybe using L’Hospital’s Rule as the user mentioned.\n\nWait, the expression (x^n - y^n)/n as n approaches 0. Let's see. If we plug n=0 directly, we get (1 - 1)/0 which is 0/0, indeterminate. So L’Hospital’s Rule might apply here. But L’Hospital is for when both numerator and denominator approach 0 or infinity. Here, numerator approaches 0 (since x^0 = 1 and y^0 =1, so 1-1=0) and denominator approaches 0. So yes, 0/0 form. So we can try differentiating the numerator and denominator with respect to n.\n\nLet me compute the derivative of the numerator with respect to n. The numerator is x^n - y^n. The derivative of x^n with respect to n is x^n * ln(x), similarly for y^n. So derivative of numerator is x^n ln(x) - y^n ln(y). The derivative of the denominator, which is n, with respect to n is 1. Therefore, by L’Hospital’s Rule, the limit as n approaches 0 is [x^0 ln(x) - y^0 ln(y)] / 1 = (ln(x) - ln(y)) = ln(x/y). That works out. So that's a valid proof using L’Hospital’s Rule. But the user mentioned they were confused about differentiating with respect to a different variable. Wait, in this case, the variable is n, and x and y are treated as constants, right? So when we take the derivative with respect to n, x and y are constants, so their derivatives are as I did. So maybe that's a straightforward approach.\n\nAlternatively, using the integral approach: The integral from y to x of t^(n-1) dt. Let's compute that integral. The integral of t^(n-1) is t^n / n, evaluated from y to x, which gives (x^n - y^n)/n. So indeed, (x^n - y^n)/n is equal to the integral from y to x of t^(n-1) dt. Then the original limit is the limit as n approaches 0 of the integral from y to x of t^(n-1) dt. If we can interchange the limit and the integral, then the integral becomes integral from y to x of lim_{n→0} t^{n-1} dt. Since t^{n-1} as n→0 is t^{-1}, so the integral of 1/t from y to x is ln(x) - ln(y) = ln(x/y). So that's another way.\n\nBut why can we interchange the limit and the integral here? In real analysis, there are theorems like the Dominated Convergence Theorem or Monotone Convergence Theorem that allow swapping limits and integrals under certain conditions. For t in [y, x], assuming y and x are positive and y < x, then t is between y and x. So t^{n-1} converges to 1/t as n→0. If we can find a dominating function, say, t^{n-1} is bounded by some integrable function near n=0. For example, when n is close to 0, say n is in (-ε, ε) for some small ε >0. If we take n approaching 0 from the right, n is positive, but approaching 0. Then t^{n-1} = t^{-1 + n} = t^{-1} * t^n. Since t is in [y, x], and t >0, t^n approaches 1 as n→0. So t^{n-1} is approximately t^{-1} near n=0. But for n approaching 0 from the negative side, n is negative, so t^{n-1} = t^{-1 + n}, which would be t^{-1 - |n|}, which could be problematic if t <1, as it might blow up. Wait, but the interval is from y to x. If y and x are both greater than 0, but depending on their values. If y and x are both greater than 1, then t^{-1 - |n|} would be bounded by t^{-1 - ε} for some small ε, but if t is greater than 1, then t^{-1 - ε} is integrable over [y, x]. If y and x are between 0 and 1, then t^{-1 - |n|} would be t^{-something larger than 1}, which might not be integrable. Wait, but the original problem doesn't specify the values of x and y. The user might have assumed x and y positive and y ≠x, but maybe more conditions are needed.\n\nWait, but in the integral approach, perhaps the user's classmate assumed that x and y are positive and that the integral is well-defined. So if we take x and y positive, then t is in [y, x], and t>0. Then t^{n-1} is continuous in n for each fixed t. To interchange the limit and the integral, we need some justification. If we can apply the Dominated Convergence Theorem, we need an integrable function that bounds t^{n-1} for all n near 0. Suppose n is in (-1/2, 1/2). Then for t in [y, x], where y >0, t^{n-1} ≤ max{ t^{-3/2}, t^{-1/2} }, depending on whether n is negative or positive. If t is in [a, b] where 0 < a ≤ t ≤ b < ∞, then t^{-3/2} is integrable over [a, b] as long as a >0. So if y >0, then yes, t^{n-1} is dominated by t^{-3/2} when n is near 0, which is integrable over [y, x]. Therefore, by Dominated Convergence Theorem, we can interchange the limit and the integral. But since the user is in high school and hasn't taken real analysis, maybe they just accept that under certain conditions (like uniform convergence), you can interchange. But since the problem is about justifying that step, maybe they need to be more careful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe expand t^{n-1} as a function of n. Using the expansion t^{n} = e^{n ln t} ≈ 1 + n ln t + o(n), so t^{n -1} = t^{-1} t^{n} ≈ t^{-1} (1 + n ln t). Then integrating term by term: integral from y to x of t^{-1} (1 + n ln t) dt = integral 1/t dt + n integral (ln t)/t dt. The first integral is ln(x/y), and the second term is n*( ( (ln t)^2 ) /2 evaluated from y to x ), which tends to 0 as n→0. Therefore, the limit is ln(x/y). This might be a way to do it without swapping the limit and integral, by expanding in a Taylor series in n.\n\nBut this also requires some justification of interchanging the integral and the expansion, but perhaps it's more intuitive for a high school student.\n\nAlternatively, consider substituting n approaching 0. Let’s write (x^n - y^n)/n = (e^{n ln x} - e^{n ln y}) / n. Then using the expansion e^{a} ≈ 1 + a + a^2/2 + ..., so e^{n ln x} ≈ 1 + n ln x + (n ln x)^2 /2 + ... Similarly for e^{n ln y}. Subtracting them gives n (ln x - ln y) + n^2 ( (ln x)^2 - (ln y)^2 ) /2 + ... Then dividing by n gives (ln x - ln y) + n ( (ln x)^2 - (ln y)^2 ) /2 + ... So as n approaches 0, the limit is ln x - ln y = ln(x/y). This is the same as using the definition of derivative: the limit as h→0 of (e^{h ln x} - e^{h ln y}) / h is the derivative of e^{h ln x} at h=0 minus the derivative of e^{h ln y} at h=0, which is ln x - ln y.\n\nSo multiple ways to approach this problem. The L’Hospital’s method seems straightforward once you recognize the 0/0 form, and the expansion using Taylor series is also a good approach. The integral method requires some justification for swapping the limit and the integral, which might be more advanced, but if you accept that swapping is allowed (for example, if the convergence is uniform, which might be the case here), then it works.\n\nNow, the user also mentioned feeling uneasy about the integral method because they haven't learned real analysis. So perhaps the L’Hospital’s approach is more suitable for their level. Let me check the assumptions here. For L’Hospital’s Rule, we need the numerator and denominator to both approach 0 or infinity. In this case, as n approaches 0, x^n approaches 1, y^n approaches 1, so the numerator is 0, and the denominator approaches 0. So it's 0/0. Then taking derivatives of numerator and denominator with respect to n gives the result. The key is that x and y are treated as constants when differentiating with respect to n. So the user's confusion about differentiating with respect to different variables might come from if they thought x and y are variables, but in this problem, they are fixed constants, and n is the variable approaching 0.\n\nTherefore, the main assumptions here are that x and y are positive real numbers (since otherwise, x^n or y^n might not be defined for real n, especially if x or y are negative), and that the limit is taken as n approaches 0. Also, x and y should not be equal, because if x=y, then the expression is 0/n, which is 0 for all n ≠0, so the limit would be 0, but log(x/y) would be log(1)=0, so it still holds. But the problem might implicitly assume x ≠ y to make the logarithm non-zero, but technically it's still valid if x=y.\n\nSo summarizing the assumptions:\n\n- x and y are positive real numbers. Because if x or y were non-positive, then x^n or y^n might not be defined for real exponents n approaching 0, especially if n is approaching from the negative side. For example, (-1)^n is not real for non-integer n.\n\n- n is a real number approaching 0. The problem says n approaches 0, not necessarily from the positive side. However, if x and y are positive, then x^n and y^n are defined for all real n, including negative n.\n\n- The expression (x^n - y^n)/n is considered in the real number context.\n\nThe problem is to compute the limit as n approaches 0 of (x^n - y^n)/n and show it equals log(x/y).\n\nSo applying the format:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a positive real number,\ny is a positive real number,\nn is a real number approaching 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\lim\\limits_{n \\to 0} \\frac{x^{n}-y^{n}}{n} = \\log\\frac{x}{y}.$$\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user's classmate considered the integral from y to x of t^{n-1} dt, which implies that y and x are positive and y < x (since integrating from y to x, usually we assume y < x). But maybe the problem allows y and x to be any positive numbers, with y not equal to x, but the integral approach requires that the limits of integration are in order. But in the problem statement, the limit is for general x and y. However, in the integral approach, if x < y, then the integral would be negative, but the original expression (x^n - y^n)/n would also be negative if x < y. So log(x/y) would be negative as well. So maybe the problem allows x and y to be any positive reals, regardless of order, and the result still holds, since log(x/y) is negative if x < y.\n\nSo the key assumptions are x and y positive, n real approaching 0. Whether x > y or x < y doesn't matter, but they must be positive. Also, the problem probably assumes x ≠ y, but even if x=y, the result holds as both sides become 0.\n\nSo the formatted problem should list the assumptions as x and y being positive reals, n approaching 0. Hence:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a positive real number,\ny is a positive real number,\nn approaches 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\lim\\limits_{n \\to 0} \\frac{x^{n}-y^{n}}{n} = \\log\\frac{x}{y}.$$\n\nThat's the structured version. The original problem didn't state the assumptions explicitly, but from the context, they are necessary for the problem to make sense. The integral approach also requires that the integral is from y to x with t positive.",
