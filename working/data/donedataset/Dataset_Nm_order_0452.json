    "AcceptedAnswer": "(1): Let $Av=\\lambda v$ with $v\\not=0$, i.e. $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $A$. Then \n$$0<v^t Av=\\lambda v^t v=\\lambda \\|v\\|^2.$$ Since $\\|v\\|^2>0$, we get $\\lambda>0$. (2): You certainly mean that the determinant of $A$ is $\\pm 1$, since the statement about the eigenvalues is not true, for consider the orthogonal matrix $$\\begin{pmatrix}\\cos\\theta & -\\sin\\theta\\\\\n\\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta\\end{pmatrix}$$ This represents a rotation and has therefore complex eigenvalues. But if $A$ is orthogonal, then $A^tA=AA^t=I$, therefore applying the $\\det$ to both sides and using the multiplication law for determinants, we obtain $$(\\det A)^2 = 1$$ Therefore $\\det A=\\pm 1$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example they provided shows breaking down the problem's assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition for one object. Then stating the problem clearly.\n\nLooking at the Math Stack Exchange question provided. The title is \"Eigenvalues in orthogonal matrices\" and the question has two parts. Let's parse each part.\n\nFirst part: 1) If for all b in R^n, b^T A b > 0, then all eigenvalues are >0. So the assumption here is that A is a real matrix, and for every real vector b, the quadratic form b^T A b is positive. That translates to A being positive definite. The conclusion is all eigenvalues are positive. So the assumption here would be that A is a real matrix, and that for all vectors b, the quadratic form is positive.\n\nSecond part: 2) If A is orthogonal, then all eigenvalues are equal to -1 or 1. The assumption here is that A is an orthogonal matrix (so A^T A = I). The conclusion is eigenvalues are ±1.\n\nBut wait, in the example given, the user separated each assumption line by line. For part 1, the assumptions are that A is in M_n(R), and that for all b in R^n, b^T A b >0. Then the problem is to prove that all eigenvalues are >0. Similarly, part 2's assumption is that A is orthogonal, and the problem is to show eigenvalues are ±1.\n\nBut the original problem has two separate parts. How to structure this? The user's example included two parts in the problem statement. Wait, looking at the example: the original problem was about proving divisibility by 91, and in the formatted version, they listed the assumptions (n is integer, n is divisible by 7) and the problem. So perhaps each part should be treated as a separate problem?\n\nWait, the original question here is two parts. The user might need to split them into two separate Problem sections? But the user's example only had one problem. Hmm. Let me check the instructions again.\n\nThe user says: \"structure that problem as the following format.\" The format has Assumption and Problem. The example had two assumptions (n is integer, n divisible by 7) and the problem. The original question here has two parts. So perhaps each part is a separate problem with their own assumptions.\n\nBut the user hasn't specified whether to split into two problems. Let's see the original question:\n\n\"Let $A \\in M_n(\\Bbb R)$. How can I prove, that 1) if $ \\forall {b \\in \\Bbb R^n}, b^{t}Ab>0$, then all eigenvalues $>0$. 2) if $A$ is orthogonal, then all eigenvalues are equal to $-1$ or $1$.\"\n\nSo two separate parts. The user might want each part as a separate problem with their own assumptions.\n\nSo for part 1:\n\nAssumption: A is a real n×n matrix.\n\nAssumption: For all vectors b in R^n, b^T A b >0.\n\nProblem: Prove that all eigenvalues of A are greater than 0.\n\nFor part 2:\n\nAssumption: A is an orthogonal matrix.\n\nProblem: Prove that all eigenvalues of A are equal to -1 or 1.\n\nBut the original problem statement combines them into one question. Should the formatted problem include both parts as two separate problems? The user's example only had one problem. However, the user's instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format.\" The original problem has two parts, so perhaps each part is a separate problem. However, in the example, the problem was a single statement. So maybe present them as two problems in one? Wait, the format example has one Problem line. The user might need both parts in one problem. Let me check the original example.\n\nIn the example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem had two assumptions (n is integer, n divisible by 7) and the problem. So perhaps if the original problem has multiple parts, each part should have its own assumption and problem.\n\nBut the user's example had only one problem. The user's instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format,\" which includes Assumption and Problem. So for the current problem, which has two parts, perhaps each part is a separate problem. So maybe structure them as two separate entries. But the user hasn't specified that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe list all assumptions for both parts first, then the problem. But that would mix the assumptions for different parts. That might be confusing.\n\nWait, looking at the example: the original problem was a single statement, and in the formatted version, the assumptions were split. Here, the original problem has two parts. Therefore, maybe each part should be formatted separately. But the user's format example is for one problem. So perhaps the answer should present two formatted problems, each corresponding to part 1 and part 2.\n\nBut the user hasn't mentioned that. Let's check the user's instructions again: \"structure that problem as the following format.\" The example had one problem with assumptions. So maybe the user expects to have two separate formatted problems here, one for each part. But the user's example didn't have that. Alternatively, list both parts as two problems in one entry.\n\nWait, in the original example, the problem was about proving divisibility by 91, and the assumptions were that n is integer and divisible by 7. The original problem here has two separate questions. The user might want to split them into two separate Assumption/Problem sections. However, the user's format is BEGIN_OF_FORMAT... and then each problem in that format. So perhaps each part is a separate formatted problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps combine them into one, but that would be incorrect because they are separate statements with different assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to structure each part as a separate problem. So:\n\nFor part 1:\n\nAssumption: A ∈ M_n(R)\n\nAssumption: For all b ∈ R^n, b^T A b > 0\n\nProblem: Prove that all eigenvalues of A are greater than 0.\n\nFor part 2:\n\nAssumption: A is an orthogonal matrix\n\nProblem: Prove that all eigenvalues of A are equal to -1 or 1.\n\nBut the original problem is presented as two parts in one question. However, according to the user's example, each problem is structured with its own assumptions and problem. Therefore, perhaps each part is a separate problem. However, the user's instruction is to structure the problem as per the format. Since the original problem has two parts, but the user wants the answer in the specified format, perhaps both parts are included in the same problem statement, but separated into two problem lines? Or perhaps the problem line includes both parts.\n\nBut in the user's example, the problem was one statement. So maybe the answer should present two formatted problems. However, since the user hasn't specified, perhaps the answer should list both as separate entries. However, the user's example is for one problem. Maybe the answer should follow the same structure, listing each part as a separate assumption and problem.\n\nWait, no. Each part has different assumptions. The first part's assumptions are A is real matrix and quadratic form is positive. The second part's assumption is A is orthogonal. Therefore, they are separate problems. Therefore, the correct answer is to present two formatted problems.\n\nBut the user's example only had one. However, the user's instructions don't specify handling multiple parts. But according to the problem, the original question has two parts, so we need to structure each part as per the format.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be two formatted problems:\n\nFirst problem:\n\nAssumption: A is an element of M_n(R)\n\nAssumption: For all b in R^n, b^T A b >0\n\nProblem: Prove that all eigenvalues of A are greater than 0.\n\nSecond problem:\n\nAssumption: A is an orthogonal matrix\n\nProblem: Prove that all eigenvalues of A are equal to -1 or 1.\n\nBut how does the user want the answer? The user's instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\". So perhaps each part is a separate problem. Therefore, present both in the answer, each with their own Assumption and Problem sections.\n\nBut the user's example didn't do that. However, the user's example had only one problem, while this one has two. Therefore, perhaps each part is a separate formatted entry. However, the user hasn't specified. But since the user provided an example with one problem, and the current problem has two parts, perhaps we need to combine them into one formatted entry. But that might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, since the original problem has two parts, maybe list the assumptions for each part in the Assumption section and have the problem include both parts. But that would mix different assumptions for different parts.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is presented as two separate statements, so in the formatted problem, they are listed as two separate problems. But the user's example format only allows one problem per formatted block. Therefore, perhaps the answer should have two separate formatted blocks. However, the user's answer requires the assistant to provide the answer in the specified format, which for one problem. But since the original problem has two parts, the answer should include both. However, the user's example has one formatted block. Maybe the answer should present both parts in one formatted block, with assumptions for each part separated? But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considered as two separate problems, each with their own assumptions. Therefore, the answer would be two formatted blocks. But the user's example shows that they might expect a single formatted block. However, since the original problem has two distinct parts, perhaps they should be treated as separate.\n\nBut the user's instructions say \"structure that problem as the following format.\" So maybe the entire problem, including both parts, is structured into one format. But how? The assumptions would be for both parts. However, each part has different assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, list all assumptions for both parts, then present both problems. But the example shows that assumptions are listed line by line, each for one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption: A ∈ M_n(R)\n\nAssumption: For all b ∈ R^n, b^T A b >0\n\nAssumption: A is an orthogonal matrix\n\nProblem: Prove that 1) all eigenvalues of A are greater than 0; 2) all eigenvalues of A are equal to -1 or 1.\n\nBut this is incorrect because the assumptions for part 1 and part 2 are different. Therefore, this approach is wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to treat each part as a separate problem. Thus, the formatted answer would have two entries:\n\nFirst:\n\nAssumption: A is an element of M_n(R)\n\nAssumption: For all b ∈ R^n, b^T A b >0\n\nProblem: Prove that all eigenvalues of A are greater than 0.\n\nSecond:\n\nAssumption: A is an orthogonal matrix\n\nProblem: Prove that all eigenvalues of A are equal to -1 or 1.\n\nBut since the user's example didn't have multiple entries, but the original problem here has two separate parts, the answer should follow the same format but for each part separately. However, in the given example, the original problem was a single statement, so the formatted problem was single. Here, the original problem has two parts. Therefore, to follow the user's example, perhaps list each part as a separate problem with their own assumptions. Therefore, the answer should present two formatted blocks. But given that the user hasn't specified this, but the example shows only one, perhaps the answer should list both parts under one problem statement, but that's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, the problem can be structured with two parts in the Problem section, each with their own assumptions. But the example didn't do that.\n\nAlternatively, the Assumption section includes all assumptions for both parts, but that's incorrect as they apply to different parts.\n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me re-read the user's instructions.\n\nThe user says: \"Your task is to read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\"\n\nThe example given by the user was:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n... divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nIn this example, the original problem's assumption that n is an integer and that the expression is divisible by 91 was rephrased into two assumptions (n is integer, n divisible by 7) and the problem. Wait, but in the original problem, it was stated as \"for every integer n\", so n is an integer. But in the formatted problem, the user added an assumption \"n is divisible by 7\" which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem says \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". So the user's example actually modified the original problem. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions are not directly taken from the problem but are inferred.\n\nWait, this is confusing. The original problem was to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, the user assumes that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But the original problem's statement was for every integer n. So maybe the example was wrong? Wait, perhaps there was a typo. Let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added the assumption that n is divisible by 7. That contradicts. Therefore, this example seems incorrect. Because the original problem didn't require n to be divisible by 7. Maybe this is a mistake, or perhaps the user intended to modify the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made an error in the example. Because if the original problem is to prove for every integer n, then the assumption should only be that n is an integer, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. But in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" which is not in the original problem.\n\nTherefore, this suggests that perhaps the user's example is incorrect, but following it, they added an extra assumption. Therefore, perhaps when formatting, we need to extract all the conditions from the problem, even if they are implied.\n\nBut in the current problem, the first part is \"if for all b in R^n, b^T A b >0, then all eigenvalues >0\". The assumption here is that A is a real matrix (given A ∈ M_n(R)), and that for all b, b^T A b >0. The problem is to prove the eigenvalues are positive.\n\nThe second part is \"if A is orthogonal, then all eigenvalues are ±1\". The assumption is A is orthogonal, and the problem is to prove eigenvalues are ±1.\n\nTherefore, for each part, the assumptions are different, so they should be formatted as two separate problems.\n\nThus, the answer should be:\n\nFirst formatted problem:\n\nAssumption: A is an element of M_n(R)\n\nAssumption: For all b in R^n, b^T A b >0\n\nProblem: Prove that all eigenvalues of A are greater than 0.\n\nSecond formatted problem:\n\nAssumption: A is an orthogonal matrix\n\nProblem: Prove that all eigenvalues of A are equal to -1 or 1.\n\nBut the user's example combined multiple conditions into one formatted problem. However, in that example, the formatted problem added an assumption not present in the original problem. So perhaps there was a mistake, but following the user's example, perhaps the assumptions are listed even if they are part of the problem statement.\n\nBut in the current problem, the first part is \"if for all b...\", so the assumption is that \"for all b...\" holds. Therefore, the assumptions for part 1 are:\n\nA is a real n×n matrix.\n\nFor every vector b in R^n, b^T A b is positive.\n\nProblem: Prove all eigenvalues of A are greater than 0.\n\nSimilarly, part 2:\n\nA is an orthogonal matrix.\n\nProblem: Prove all eigenvalues of A are ±1.\n\nTherefore, the formatted answer should have two parts, each with their own assumptions and problem. But since the user's example didn't do that, but the current problem has two separate statements, perhaps we need to follow the example's structure but split into two formatted entries.\n\nHowever, the user's instructions only provided one example. Given that, perhaps the answer should present each part as a separate formatted block, even though the user's example didn't show that. Because otherwise, combining them would mix different assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, if we follow the user's example strictly, even if incorrect, the assumptions would be listed, then the problem. But in the original problem, there are two separate statements. Therefore, maybe the answer should have two formatted blocks.\n\nBut given the user's example, perhaps the answer is:\n\nAssumption: A ∈ M_n(R)\n\nAssumption: For all b ∈ R^n, b^T A b >0\n\nAssumption: A is an orthogonal matrix\n\nProblem: Prove that 1) all eigenvalues of A are greater than 0; 2) all eigenvalues of A are equal to -1 or 1.\n\nBut this is incorrect because the assumptions for part 1 and part 2 are separate. Therefore, this approach is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the correct way is to separate them into two formatted blocks. Therefore, the answer is two formatted problems.\n\nBut the user's example didn't do that, but given that the original problem has two parts, this seems necessary.\n\nHowever, considering the user's instructions and example, perhaps they expect both parts to be in one problem statement with their respective assumptions. For example:\n\nAssumption: A ∈ M_n(R)\n\nAssumption: For all b ∈ R^n, b^T A b >0\n\nAssumption: A is an orthogonal matrix\n\nProblem: Prove that 1) all eigenvalues of A are greater than 0; 2) all eigenvalues of A are equal to -1 or 1.\n\nBut this is incorrect because the first two assumptions apply to the first part, and the third assumption applies to the second part. Combining them in the same assumption list implies that all assumptions apply to both problems, which is not the case.\n\nTherefore, the only correct way is to present them as two separate formatted problems. Given that, the answer should have two entries. However, since the user's example didn't show multiple entries, perhaps the answer should present them as two bullet points or similar. But the format specified is:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: <...>\nProblem: <...>\n###\n\nTherefore, each formatted problem must be within this block. Hence, for two problems, two blocks.\n\nBut the user's instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\", where \"that problem\" refers to the provided Math Stack Exchange question. Since the provided question has two parts, it's ambiguous whether the user wants two formatted problems or one. However, given the example, the user expects one formatted block per original problem. Therefore, perhaps the answer should have two formatted blocks.\n\nBut since the user hasn't specified, perhaps it's acceptable to present them as two separate formatted blocks. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nFirst formatted block:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: A is an element of M_n(R)\nAssumption: For all b ∈ R^n, b^T A b > 0\nProblem: Prove that all eigenvalues of A are greater than 0.\n###\n\nSecond formatted block:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: A is an orthogonal matrix\nProblem: Prove that all eigenvalues of A are equal to -1 or 1.\n###\n\nBut in the user's example, they included two assumptions in one block. Therefore, following that, each part of the problem is its own formatted block.\n\nTherefore, this is the correct approach.",
