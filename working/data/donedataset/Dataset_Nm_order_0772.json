    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants to prove that the sum of squares of n nonnegative numbers with a fixed sum k is minimized when all the numbers are equal. Hmm, I remember something about this from optimization. Maybe using calculus or inequalities like Cauchy-Schwarz?\n\nFirst, let's restate the problem. We have x₁ + x₂ + ... + xₙ = k, and all xᵢ are nonnegative. We need to show that the sum of their squares is minimized when each xᵢ = k/n. \n\nMaybe using Lagrange multipliers? That's a method for finding maxima and minima of functions subject to constraints. The function to minimize would be f(x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ) = x₁² + x₂² + ... + xₙ², subject to the constraint g(x₁, ..., xₙ) = x₁ + ... + xₙ - k = 0.\n\nSetting up the Lagrangian: L = Σxᵢ² - λ(Σxᵢ - k). Taking partial derivatives with respect to each xᵢ: ∂L/∂xᵢ = 2xᵢ - λ = 0. So each xᵢ = λ/2. That means all xᵢ are equal at the critical point. Then, substituting into the constraint: n*(λ/2) = k → λ = 2k/n. So each xᵢ = k/n. Since the function is convex, this critical point should be a minimum. \n\nAlternatively, could use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. The sum (x₁² + ... + xₙ²)(1² + ... +1²) ≥ (x₁ + ... +xₙ)². That gives Σxᵢ² ≥ k²/n. Equality holds when xᵢ/1 = constant, so all xᵢ equal. Therefore, the minimum is k²/n when all xᵢ = k/n. \n\nAnother approach: Suppose not all xᵢ are equal. Let’s take two variables, say x₁ and x₂, where x₁ ≠ x₂. Replace them with their average: x₁' = x₂' = (x₁ + x₂)/2. Then the sum remains the same, but the sum of squares decreases because (x₁² + x₂²)/2 ≥ ((x₁ + x₂)/2)² by the QM-AM inequality. Repeating this process until all variables are equal would result in the minimal sum of squares. \n\nWait, but the problem states nonnegative values. Does nonnegativity affect anything? If some variables were negative, adjusting them might increase the sum, but since all are nonnegative, the above methods should hold. \n\nAlso, maybe induction? For n=1, trivial. Assume true for n-1, then for n, fix x₁ + ... +xₙ =k. Suppose one variable is different, then show that making it equal to the others reduces the sum. Not sure, but the Lagrange multiplier or Cauchy-Schwarz seems more straightforward. \n\nSo the key assumptions are that the sum is fixed, the variables are nonnegative, and we need to minimize the sum of squares. The problem doesn't mention differentiability or anything else, so the answer should use one of these methods. Since the user might not know calculus, maybe the Cauchy-Schwarz or the averaging argument is better. But the structured problem should just list the assumptions without the proof method. Let me check the example given. The original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the example provided, the user restructured it with that assumption. Wait, in the original problem here, the user's example didn't include that assumption. Wait, no, the example was the other problem. Wait, the user provided an example where the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, an assumption was added that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no, looking back: the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption was added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like the example might have a mistake? But maybe the user is showing how to structure. So in the current problem, the assumptions are: variables are nonnegative, their sum is k. So each of those is a separate assumption. Then the problem is to prove the sum of squares is minimized when all equal. So the formatted version should have:\n\nAssumptions:\nEach x_i is nonnegative,\nThe sum of x_i from i=1 to n is k.\n\nProblem: Prove that the sum of squares x₁² + ... + xₙ² is minimized when x₁ = x₂ = ... = xₙ.\n\nYes, that's right. Each assumption is one condition applied to the objects. So each x_i is nonnegative (one property applied to each object), and their sum is k (another condition applied to the collection). So the formatted problem should capture that.",
