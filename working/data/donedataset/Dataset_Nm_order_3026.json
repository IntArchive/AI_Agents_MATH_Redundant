    "Content": "In Sheldon Axler's \"Linear Algebra Done Right\" 3rd edtion Page 36 he worte: Proof of every subspaces of a finite-dimensional vector space is finite-dimensional The question is: I do not understand the last sentence\"Thus the process eventually terminates, which means that U is finite-dimensional\". So far I can understand that the subspace $U$ has limited length of independent vector list, but how to reach from here to the conclusion that subspace $U$ is finite dimensional? By 2.23 we see that the length of spanning list of vectors can be more than(rather than less than) the finite list vetors' length. Thus finite length of  independent vectors list does not imply finite length of spanning list! My proof : By the definition of subspace, we see that $U$ is a subset of $V$ (with some other restrictions). Then, for every $u\\in U$ , $u\\in V$ , implying $u\\in span(v_1,v_2,...,v_m)$ for $V= span (v_1,v_2,...,v_m)$ (Here I used the difinition 2.10). QED. 2.23 Length of linearly independent list length of spanning list In a ﬁnite-dimensional vector space, the length of every linearly\nindependent list of vectors is less than or equal to the length of\nevery spanning list of vectors. 2.10 Deﬁnition ﬁnite-dimensional vectors pace A vector space is called ﬁnite-dimensional if some list of vectors in it spans the space. Please verify why Professor Axler's proof is valid and point out any mistakes I've made in my understanding or proof if there are some, thanks in advance!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The proof in the book is correct and yours isn't. Indeed, it cannot be proved that a subspace of a finitely generated vector space $V$ is finitely generate only on the basis of the vector space axioms, without using a very specific property of the field of scalars, namely that it is a field, so a noetherian ring. It is true that any $u\\in U$ is a linear combination of a spanning set for $V$, but what you need is a finite set of vectors in $U$ (not just in $V$) that spans $U$. The key points in the proof are: no linearly independent set of vectors can have more elements than the dimension of the space $V$; if $(v_1,\\dots,v_{j-1})$ is linearly independent and $v_j\\notin\\operatorname{span}(v_1,\\dots,v_{j-1})$, then also $(v_1,\\dots,v_{j-1},v_j)$ is linearly independent. If $U$ were not finitely generated, then the process outlined in the proof, which uses the second key point, would not stop, contradicting the first key point. Note that the first key point relies on the fact that nonzero scalars have an inverse. Without this property, one cannot prove it.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. The example provided shows that I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement from the original question.\n\nFirst, I need to read the original problem carefully. The question is about understanding a proof from Axler's Linear Algebra Done Right that every subspace of a finite-dimensional vector space is finite-dimensional. The user is confused about why the process of adding vectors eventually terminates, leading to the conclusion that the subspace U is finite-dimensional. They also provided their own proof and want verification.\n\nNow, applying the format: The assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. The problem statement should be the core question.\n\nLooking at the original problem, the key assumptions are:\n1. V is a finite-dimensional vector space. (This is given in the theorem.)\n2. U is a subspace of V. (The theorem is about subspaces of V.)\n\nThe problem is to prove that every subspace U of V is finite-dimensional. The user is questioning the validity of Axler's proof and their own approach. However, the structured problem should focus on the original theorem, not the user's specific doubts. \n\nWait, the example given had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, even though the original problem just stated \"for every integer n\". The example included an extra assumption. Hmm, maybe in that case, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91, which factors into 7*13, so perhaps the original problem had n divisible by 7? Wait, no, in the example, the user restructured the problem to include an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the original problem was for every integer n. Maybe the example was incorrect. But the user's instruction says to list all assumptions from the problem. So perhaps in the given example, the assumption was incorrect. But maybe the example was a wrong example, but the user still wants us to follow the format.\n\nWait, perhaps the example is illustrative. So in the current problem, the assumptions are that V is finite-dimensional and U is a subspace of V. The problem is to prove U is finite-dimensional. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nV is a finite-dimensional vector space,\nU is a subspace of V.\n\nProblem:\nProve that U is finite-dimensional.\n\nBut the user's original question also references definitions and theorems. However, the task is to filter unrelated information and structure the problem. The user's own proof attempt might not be part of the problem's assumptions. The core problem is from Axler's book: Prove every subspace of a finite-dimensional vector space is finite-dimensional. So the assumptions are V is finite-dimensional, U is a subspace of V. The problem is to prove U is finite-dimensional.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have those two assumptions and the problem statement.",
