    "Content": "This question is from the book \"Abstract Algebra\" by Dummit and Foote.(Exercise: 7.6.4): Problem: Prove that if $R$ and $S$ are any two non-zero rings then $R \\times S$ is never a field. My problem with this question is that it doesn't feel right. If $R$ and $S$ are rings then $R \\times S$ is also so. (The addition and multiplication on $R \\times S$ is defined as $(r_1,s_1)+(r_2,s_2)=(r_1+r_2,s_1+s_2)$ and $(r_1,s_1)(r_2,s_2)=(r_1r_2,s_1s_2)$ respectively where $(r_1,s_1),(r_2,s_2) \\in R \\times S$.) So proving that $R \\times S$ is a field reduces to proving commutativity of multiplication, existence of multiplicative indentity and existence of multiplicative inverse for each element of it. Now, if the two rings are fields themselves then multiplication is commutative, the identy is $(1_R,1_S)$ and inverse of an element $(r,s)$ is $(r^{-1},s^{-1})$. So $R \\times S$ is also a field.\nAm I right? Please help. Update: The question comes from a section about the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Is it possible to prove this fact using Chinese Remainder Theorem?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Since $R$ is nonzero, there is an $r\\in R$, $r\\neq 0$. Since $S$ is nonzero, there exists $s\\in S$, $s\\neq 0$. Since $r\\neq 0$, then $(r,0_S)\\in R\\times S$ is not zero; and since $s\\neq 0$, then $(0_R,s)\\in R\\times S$ is not zero. What is the product of $(r,0_S)$ and $(0_R,s)$? Can that happen if nonzero elements are cancellable? Are nonzero elements cancellable in a division ring? (This shows a slightly stronger statement: a direct product of nontrivial rings always has zero divisors.) Alternatively. Prove that $R\\times\\{0\\}$ is a proper ideal of $R\\times S$ (here you use that $R\\neq 0$ and $S\\neq 0$). Then remember that fields are simple.",

This directly addresses the user’s confusion about component-wise inverses.",
    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user is asking why the product of two non-zero rings, R × S, can never be a field. They mentioned that if both R and S are fields, then R × S should also be a field because it has commutative multiplication, identity elements, and inverses. But according to Dummit and Foote, that's not the case. Hmm, where's the mistake here?\n\nFirst, I need to recall the definitions. A field is a commutative ring with unity where every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. So, for R × S to be a field, every non-zero element must have an inverse. Let's think about elements in R × S. If both R and S are fields, then take an element like (r, 0) where r ≠ 0. But in the second component, it's 0, which is not invertible in S. Wait, so even if R and S are fields, R × S would have zero divisors. For example, (1,0) multiplied by (0,1) is (0,0), which is the zero element. But in a field, there shouldn't be any zero divisors except zero itself. So, the existence of zero divisors in R × S means it can't be a field, even if R and S are fields. That makes sense.\n\nSo the key point is that the product ring has zero divisors, which violates the field's requirement that every non-zero element is a unit (i.e., has an inverse). Therefore, the original assumption that R × S is a field when R and S are fields is incorrect because of these zero divisors. The user probably missed considering elements where one component is zero. Even though each component ring is a field, once you take the product, you introduce pairs where one part is non-zero and the other is zero, leading to zero divisors.\n\nAdditionally, the user mentioned the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). CRT usually applies when two ideals are coprime, leading to an isomorphism between the quotient ring and the product of the quotient rings. But here, we're dealing with the direct product of two rings, not necessarily related via coprime ideals. Maybe there's a connection, but I'm not sure. Perhaps if R and S are considered as quotient rings via CRT, but the problem doesn't specify that. The main issue is the zero divisors in the product ring, which inherently prevent it from being a field or an integral domain.\n\nSo, structuring the problem as per the required format, the assumptions would be that R and S are non-zero rings, and the problem is to prove their product isn't a field. The user's confusion comes from thinking component-wise inverses would make the product a field, but neglecting the zero divisors.",
