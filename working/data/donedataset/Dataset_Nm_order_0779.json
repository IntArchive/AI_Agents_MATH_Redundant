    "Content": "I stumbled upon this \"relation\" (is the name correct?): $$\n\\lim_{m \\to \\infty} \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\cos^{2n}(m! \\pi x) = \\begin{cases}\n1,&x\\text{ is rational}\\\\\n0,&x\\text{ is irrational}\\end{cases}\n$$ How is it called and why is it so? I'm really not asking for a proof since I fear it would be too complicated for me to understand, but rather for an \"intuition\".",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The intuition is already almost the proof. The cosine takes values between $-1$ and $1$, inclusive Taking an even power ensures that the values are between $0$ and $1$. Taking higher and higher powers will not affect those $x$ where the cosine squared is $1$, but all other values will converge to $0$ Thus $f(x):=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\cos^{2n}(x)$ is a function that has value $0$ for all $x$, except that $f(x)=1$ if $\\cos(x)=\\pm1$, i.e. if $x$ is a multiple of $\\pi$.\nAfter this, we see that multiplying the argument with $\\pi$ is done to have the value $1$ at integers instead of multiples of $\\pi$. Then the multiplication with $m!$ serves the purpose to obtain $1$ for any integer multiple of $\\frac1{m!}$. As $m\\to \\infty$, this exhausts the rationals (and only them).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that the assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then, the problem statement itself.\n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The title is \"Double limit of cos^{2n}(m! π x) at rationals and irrationals\". The user is asking about the validity of the given relation where the double limit equals 1 if x is rational and 0 if x is irrational. They want to know the name of this relation and the intuition behind it, not a full proof.\n\nNow, applying the format. The problem is about the double limit of the function cos^{2n}(m! π x) depending on whether x is rational or irrational. The assumptions here would be about the conditions under which the limit holds. The original problem states that x is either rational or irrational. So each of these is a separate condition on x. Also, the limits are taken as m and n approach infinity in a specific order: first m to infinity, then n to infinity. Wait, actually, in the expression given, the limits are written as lim_{m→∞} lim_{n→∞}, so the inner limit is n approaching infinity first, then m. But the problem is about the double limit. However, the problem statement itself is the equation given, so the assumptions would be the conditions on x (rational or irrational) and perhaps the order of the limits.\n\nBut looking at the example, in the assumption part, they listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Each assumption is a single property of a single object. So here, the key assumptions are x being rational or irrational. However, in the problem statement as given, the conclusion is based on x's rationality. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n1. x is a rational number.\n2. x is an irrational number.\n\nBut the problem is to show that the double limit equals 1 if x is rational and 0 if irrational. Wait, but in the example, the assumption included conditions on n (like being an integer and divisible by 7). Here, the problem is about the result holding for x rational or irrational, but the problem statement is the equation itself. So perhaps the problem is to explain why this double limit gives 1 for rational x and 0 otherwise. But the user wants the problem structured into assumptions and problem. The original question doesn't state any assumptions; it's presenting the relation and asking for intuition and its name.\n\nWait, perhaps the assumptions are implicit in the problem. Let me check the original problem again: the user wrote that the limit is 1 when x is rational and 0 when irrational. So the problem is to explain why this is the case. The assumptions would be the conditions on x (rational or irrational) and perhaps that m and n are integers approaching infinity. However, in the example, the assumptions were about the variables in the problem. So here, maybe:\n\nAssumptions:\n- x is a real number.\n- m and n are positive integers approaching infinity in the order m first, then n.\n\nBut the problem statement is the equation given. Alternatively, the key assumptions are the cases when x is rational or irrational. However, the problem is about the limit depending on x's rationality. So perhaps the assumptions are the two cases: x rational and x irrational. But the example's assumption was about the variable's properties. Wait, in the example, the user rephrased the original problem which had \"for every integer n\" into an assumption that n is an integer and added another assumption that n is divisible by 7. But the original problem in the example was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added the assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, the original example was:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems like the example is wrong, because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That would change the problem. Maybe there was a mistake in the example. But perhaps the user intended that when structuring the problem, they list the assumptions that are needed. So perhaps in the original problem, the user mistakenly added the divisibility by 7, but actually, the original problem's assumptions are that n is an integer. So maybe the example is incorrect, but following that pattern, perhaps for the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number,\nm and n are positive integers,\nthe limits are taken in the order: first m approaches infinity, then n approaches infinity.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $$\\lim_{m \\to \\infty} \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\cos^{2n}(m! \\pi x) = \\begin{cases}1, & x \\text{ is rational} \\\\ 0, & x \\text{ is irrational}\\end{cases}.$$\n\nBut the original problem states that the limit is as given, and the question is about why that is the case. However, according to the user's example, the formatted problem's assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. In the example, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps there was a misunderstanding. Let me check again:\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that's conflicting. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, making the problem only for n divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Perhaps the user intended to include the necessary conditions for the divisibility by 91. For example, 91 = 13*7, so maybe the problem requires n to be divisible by 7 and another condition. But in the example, the formatted problem's assumptions include n being an integer and n divisible by 7. However, the original problem didn't have that. So perhaps the example is incorrect. Therefore, perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions should be based on the problem's conditions. The problem here is about the double limit, and the result depends on x being rational or irrational. So the key assumptions are x being rational or irrational. But since the problem statement is to show the limit equals 1 or 0 based on x's rationality, maybe the assumptions are the two cases. However, according to the user's example, each assumption should be a single line addressing one property of one object. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a rational number,\nx is an irrational number,\nm and n are positive integers approaching infinity,\nthe order of limits is m first, then n.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $$\\lim_{m \\to \\infty} \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\cos^{2n}(m! \\pi x)$$ equals 1 if x is rational and 0 if x is irrational.\n\nBut the original problem's equation already states the cases. However, in the example, the formatted problem's problem statement is the same as the original but with the assumptions extracted. So perhaps here, the assumptions are:\n\n- x is a real number (since the problem is about real x being rational or irrational)\n- m and n are positive integers approaching infinity in the order m first, then n.\n\nBut the key conditions leading to the result are x's rationality. However, the problem's answer depends on x being rational or irrational. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- x is rational.\n- x is irrational.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption is a separate line. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a rational number,\nx is an irrational number,\nm and n are integers approaching infinity,\nlimits are taken in the order: m first, then n.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\lim_{m \\to \\infty} \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\cos^{2n}(m! \\pi x) = \\begin{cases}1, & x \\text{ is rational} \\\\ 0, & x \\text{ is irrational}\\end{cases}.$$\n\nBut wait, the original problem's statement is the equation itself. So the problem is to show that the double limit equals the given cases. The user is asking for intuition and the name of this relation. But according to the formatting example, we need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. The example included assumptions that were perhaps part of the problem's conditions, even if they were not explicitly stated. For instance, the original example problem says \"for every integer n\", which becomes an assumption that n is an integer. Then, perhaps the additional assumption that n is divisible by 7 might have been a mistake, but maybe in that case, the problem was actually to prove divisibility by 91 under the condition that n is divisible by 7. That's unclear. However, following the user's example, perhaps for the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\n1. x is a real number.\n2. m and n are positive integers approaching infinity.\n3. The limits are taken sequentially: first m approaches infinity, then n approaches infinity.\n\nAnd the problem is to show that the double limit equals 1 if x is rational and 0 if irrational.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem's conclusion is based on x being rational or irrational, those are the key conditions, so perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a rational number,\nx is an irrational number,\nm and n are positive integers,\nthe order of limits is m first, then n.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the double limit $$\\lim_{m \\to \\infty} \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\cos^{2n}(m! \\pi x)$$ equals 1 when x is rational and 0 when x is irrational.\n\nBut I need to ensure each assumption is a single line addressing one property of one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a rational number,\nx is an irrational number,\nm is a positive integer,\nn is a positive integer,\nthe limit is taken as m approaches infinity first,\nthe limit is taken as n approaches infinity second.\n\nBut this seems redundant. Maybe the key assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number,\nm and n are positive integers,\nthe limits are evaluated in the order: m → ∞ followed by n → ∞.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the double limit $$\\lim_{m \\to \\infty} \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\cos^{2n}(m! \\pi x)$$ equals 1 if x is rational and 0 if x is irrational.\n\nBut the original problem's equation already includes the piecewise function based on x's rationality. So the problem is to prove that equation. Therefore, the assumptions are the conditions on x (rational or irrational) and the order of the limits. However, the problem statement in the example didn't include the cases in the assumptions but listed the conditions as separate assumptions. Wait, in the example, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. That seems incorrect, but following that pattern, perhaps here the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a rational number,\nx is an irrational number,\nm and n are positive integers,\nthe limits are taken in the order m first then n.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\lim_{m \\to \\infty} \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\cos^{2n}(m! \\pi x)$$ equals 1 for rational x and 0 for irrational x.\n\nBut the original problem's equation already states the cases. So maybe the problem statement is as given, and the assumptions are the conditions on x and the order of limits. However, the example's formatting seems to list the assumptions that are necessary for the problem. In the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem lists n as an integer and divisible by 7. That suggests that perhaps the user made a mistake in the example, but we need to follow the structure. So here, the key assumptions are:\n\n- x is rational or irrational.\n- The order of the limits is first m to infinity, then n to infinity.\n\nBut each assumption should be a single line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a rational number,\nx is an irrational number,\nm and n are positive integers approaching infinity,\nthe limit over m is taken before the limit over n.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\lim_{m \\to \\infty} \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\cos^{2n}(m! \\pi x)$$ equals 1 if x is rational and 0 if x is irrational.\n\nI think this makes sense. Each assumption is a single line. The problem is to prove the limit equals the given cases based on x's rationality. The order of the limits is crucial here, so it's an important assumption. Also, m and n being positive integers approaching infinity. However, in the example, the assumptions were about the variables (n being integer and divisible by 7), so here m and n being positive integers approaching infinity would be assumptions. So final formatting:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nx is a rational number,\nx is an irrational number,\nm is a positive integer approaching infinity,\nn is a positive integer approaching infinity,\nthe limit over m is evaluated before the limit over n.\nProblem: \nProve that $$\\lim_{m \\to \\infty} \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\cos^{2n}(m! \\pi x) = \\begin{cases}1, & x \\text{ is rational} \\\\ 0, & x \\text{ is irrational}\\end{cases}.$$\n###",
