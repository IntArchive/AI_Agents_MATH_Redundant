    "Content": "For any two points inside a regular polygon on the complex plane, where the vertices of the polygon are on a unit circle, one of the vertices is at (1, 0), and the centre of the polygon is at (0,0).  Can we prove that the multiplication of these two complex number is still inside this polygon (a rotated and shortened version of one of the two original complex numbers)? I guess it's right but I haven't figured out how to prove it. Or maybe it's just not right. Take the square as an example, with four vetices $v_1, \\ldots v_4$ , I am just wondering whether the multiplication of any $a_1a_2$ is still in this regular polygon.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The vertices of your polygon are given by $1,\\omega,\\omega^2,\\ldots,\\omega^{n-1}$ , where $\\omega=e^{2\\pi i/n}$ is a primitive $n$ th root of unity. Since the polygon is convex, each point inside it is a convex linear combination* of the points $\\{1,\\omega,\\omega^2,\\ldots,\\omega^{n-1}\\}$ . This means that, if $z_1$ and $z_2$ are both inside the polygon, each is a convex linear combination of $\\{\\omega^j\\colon 0\\leq j<n\\}$ , and so their product is a convex linear combination of $$\\{\\omega^{j+k}\\colon 0\\leq j,k<n\\}.$$ (This is a special case of a more general fact: if $z_1$ is a convex linear combination of a set $S_1$ and $z_2$ is a convex linear combination of a set $S_2$ , then $z_1z_2$ is a convex linear combination of the product set $\\{s_1s_2\\colon s_1\\in S_1,s_2\\in S_2\\}$ .) Now, since $\\omega$ is an $n$ th root of unity, each $\\omega^{j+k}$ is equal to $\\omega^\\ell$ for some $0\\leq\\ell<n$ (take $\\ell=j+k$ if $j+k<n$ , and $\\ell=j+k-n$ otherwise). So, $$\\{\\omega^{j+k}\\colon 0\\leq j,k<n\\}=\\{\\omega^\\ell\\colon 0\\leq \\ell<n\\}$$ is simply the set of vertices of the original polygon. So, $z_1z_2$ is a convex linear combination of the vertices of the polygon, and so it lies in the polygon, as desired. *A convex linear combination of points $x_1,\\ldots,x_n$ is an expression of the form $\\lambda_1x_1+\\cdots+\\lambda_nx_n$ with $\\lambda_1,\\ldots,\\lambda_n\\geq 0$ and $\\lambda_1+\\cdots+\\lambda_n=1$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this Math Stack Exchange question according to the given format. Let me read through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe user is asking whether multiplying two complex numbers that lie inside a regular polygon (with vertices on the unit circle, one vertex at (1,0), center at the origin) results in another complex number still inside that same polygon. They mention taking the square as an example and wonder if the product stays within the polygon.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions one by one, each addressing a single property or condition applied to one object. Let me parse the problem:\n\n1. The polygon is regular.\n2. The vertices of the polygon lie on the unit circle.\n3. One of the vertices is at (1, 0).\n4. The center of the polygon is at (0,0).\n5. The two complex numbers (points) are inside this polygon.\n6. The problem asks if their product is also inside the polygon.\n\nWait, the original question says \"for any two points inside a regular polygon...\" with the specified conditions. So the key assumptions are about the polygon's regularity, vertices on the unit circle, one vertex at (1,0), center at origin, and the two complex numbers being inside this polygon. The problem is whether their product is still inside the polygon.\n\nSo structuring the assumptions:\n\n- The polygon is regular.\n- The polygon's vertices are on the unit circle.\n- One vertex of the polygon is at (1, 0).\n- The center of the polygon is at (0, 0).\n- Two complex numbers are inside the polygon.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that the product of these two complex numbers is still inside the polygon.\n\nBut wait, the user mentions \"a rotated and shortened version of one of the two original complex numbers\". Maybe that's part of their thought process, not an assumption. So we shouldn't include that in the assumptions. The problem is as stated: whether the product is inside the polygon.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is a single condition. Let me check:\n\n1. Regular polygon: yes, one assumption.\n2. Vertices on unit circle: another.\n3. One vertex at (1,0): third.\n4. Center at (0,0): fourth.\n5. Two complex numbers inside: fifth.\n\nYes, each is a separate condition. The problem statement is then about the product being inside the polygon.\n\nThe example given in the original problem (square) is just an example, so perhaps not part of the assumptions. The main problem is general for any regular polygon under those conditions.\n\nSo the formatted problem should list those five assumptions and then state the problem of proving the product is inside the polygon.\n\nWait, but in the example provided by the user, the assumption included that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the original problem. However, in this current problem, the user hasn't specified any divisibility conditions. The assumptions are about the polygon's properties and the location of the complex numbers.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n- The polygon is regular.\n- The polygon's vertices lie on the unit circle.\n- One vertex of the polygon is at (1, 0).\n- The center of the polygon is at (0, 0).\n- The two complex numbers are inside the polygon.\n\nProblem: Prove that the product of these two complex numbers is still inside this polygon.\n\nBut the original question also mentions \"a rotated and shortened version of one of the two original complex numbers\", which might be the user's conjecture. However, since the task is to structure the problem as per the given format, we should only include the explicit assumptions from the problem statement, not the user's thoughts.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe polygon is regular,\nThe polygon's vertices are on the unit circle,\nOne vertex of the polygon is at (1, 0),\nThe center of the polygon is at (0, 0),\nTwo complex numbers are inside the polygon.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the product of these two complex numbers is still inside this polygon.\n\nWait, but in the original example, the assumption was split into separate lines, each as a bullet point. The user's instruction says to list each assumption line by line. So in the formatted answer, each assumption is a separate line.\n\nAlso, the original problem says \"Can we prove that the multiplication of these two complex number is still inside this polygon...\" So the problem is to prove that the product is inside.\n\nI think that's all. Let me check the example again. In the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in the original problem here, the assumptions are about the polygon and the complex numbers. So the formatted answer should have those five assumptions, each as a separate line, and the problem statement.\n\nSo final answer:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nThe polygon is regular,\nThe polygon's vertices lie on the unit circle,\nOne vertex of the polygon is located at (1, 0),\nThe center of the polygon is at (0, 0),\nTwo complex numbers are inside the polygon.\nProblem:\nProve that the product of these two complex numbers is still inside this polygon.",
