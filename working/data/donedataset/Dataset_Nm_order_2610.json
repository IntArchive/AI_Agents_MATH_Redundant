    "Content": "I just noticed that I have left unanswered one part of an old multi-part question and so decided to re-ask it separately: Consider the sequence $e^n\\bmod 1$ , $n\\in\\Bbb N$ . Show that it is dense in $[0,1]$ . This apparently does require specific (approximation?) properties of $e$ , as for example replacing $e$ with any integer leads to a non-dense sequence. On the other hand, for every sequence of numbers $a_n\\in(0,1)$ , it is not hard to find $\\alpha$ such that $|\\alpha^{2^n}\\bmod 1- a_n|<\\frac1n$ for all $n$ , or $\\beta$ such that $|\\beta^n\\bmod 1-a_n|<\\frac1{1000}$ . Hence there exist (irrational) bases that lead to a dense sequence and others that lead to a non-dense sequence.\nOther than that I'm a bit at a dead end.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I was asked to turn a comment into an answer, even though it was mainly a quote, not any work of my own. It's well known that the fractional parts $\\{\\theta^n\\}$ are not just dense, but uniformly distributed for almost all $\\theta$ . The irony is, that for any individual $\\theta$ , we don't know nearly as much. Let's quote http://www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~kenkyubu/bessatsu/open/B34/pdf/B34_009.pdf For instance, we cannot disprove that $\\displaystyle \\lim\\{e^{n}\\}=0$ ,where $\\{x\\}$ is the fractional part of a real number $x$ . In the case where $\\alpha$ is a transcendental number, it is generally difficult to\nprove that the sequence $\\{\\alpha^{n}\\}(n=0,1, \\ldots)$ has two\ndistinct limit points. So there's little hope concerning transcendental numbers like $e$ , and the results for algebraic $\\theta$ aren't exactly mind-boggling, either. We can but hope that there will be some progress, soon.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me first read through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe original problem's title is \"Prove that $e^n\\bmod 1$ is dense in $[0,1]$\". The question body mentions that the sequence $e^n \\bmod 1$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ should be shown to be dense in [0,1]. The user also notes that replacing $e$ with an integer results in a non-dense sequence, implying that specific properties of $e$ are necessary. They also mention some examples of constructing other bases but admit being stuck.\n\nNow, according to the format provided, I need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then, state the problem concisely.\n\nFirst, let's parse the problem. The main object here is the sequence $e^n \\bmod 1$, and we need to show it's dense in [0,1]. The key conditions here are that $n$ is a natural number, and the base is $e$, which is irrational. The user also mentions that integer bases don't work, so the assumption must involve $e$ being irrational. However, the original problem doesn't explicitly state an assumption that $e$ is irrational—it's more of a given. But in the example provided, the assumption included that $n$ is divisible by 7, which was part of the problem's original statement. Wait, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like a mistake. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal example problem says \"Prove that for every integer n... is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted assumption lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem didn't state that n must be divisible by 7. That seems like an error. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect? Or perhaps the user made a typo. Wait, the example's original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be a mistake. But regardless, I need to follow the instructions given, which say to list all assumptions from the problem. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should be that n is an integer. But the formatted example added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which wasn't in the original. That seems incorrect. Maybe the example was faulty. But perhaps in that case, the problem actually required n to be divisible by 7, but the original question didn't state that? Wait, no. The original problem in the example was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The user's formatted version added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, this is conflicting. Maybe there was a miscommunication in the example. But regardless, the task is to process the current problem.\n\nBack to the current problem: the user wants to structure the problem into Assumptions and Problem. The question is to prove that $e^n \\bmod 1$ is dense in [0,1], where $n$ is a natural number. The problem mentions that replacing $e$ with an integer leads to a non-dense sequence. So the key assumptions here are:\n\n1. $n$ is a natural number (since the sequence is defined for $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$).\n2. The base is $e$ (since replacing $e$ with an integer doesn't work, so $e$ is specifically required).\n3. $e$ is irrational (since the problem implies that using an integer, which is rational, doesn't work, so the irrationality of $e$ is probably a key assumption here, even though it's not stated explicitly in the original question. However, the original problem says \"replacing $e$ with any integer leads to a non-dense sequence\", which suggests that the problem is about $e$ being a specific non-integer (and hence irrational) base. So the assumption here would be that $e$ is irrational. But the original problem doesn't state this; it's part of common knowledge. However, since the problem mentions that replacing $e$ with an integer leads to non-density, maybe the assumption is that $e$ is not an integer. But since $e$ is known to be irrational, which is stronger than not being an integer. But maybe the problem doesn't require assuming that, as the problem just states to prove the density for $e^n \\bmod 1$.\n\nWait, the problem as stated in the title is to prove that $e^n \\bmod 1$ is dense in [0,1]. The question body says that replacing $e$ with an integer leads to a non-dense sequence. So the key here is that $e$ is not an integer. However, $e$ is not just any non-integer, but specifically an irrational number. But the problem doesn't state any assumptions about $e$; it's given. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- $n$ is a natural number.\n- The base is $e$ (a specific transcendental number).\n\nBut since the problem is to prove density, which relies on properties of $e$, maybe the problem implicitly uses that $e$ is irrational. However, in the example given by the user, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem didn't state that. That might indicate that the user wants all the underlying assumptions, even those not explicitly stated. So perhaps here, the assumptions are:\n\n- $n$ is a natural number.\n- $e$ is an irrational number.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that replacing $e$ with any integer (which is rational) leads to a non-dense sequence. So the assumption here is that $e$ is not an integer, but more precisely, it's irrational. However, the problem doesn't state that $e$ is irrational; it's common knowledge. So perhaps in the assumptions, we need to list that $e$ is irrational. But the original problem doesn't state that as a condition; it's part of the given. So maybe the user's example was incorrect, but according to the instructions, we need to filter the problem and structure it. The problem says \"Prove that $e^n \\bmod 1$ is dense in [0,1]\". The key assumptions are:\n\n- $n$ is a natural number.\n- The base is $e$.\n\nBut since the problem mentions that replacing $e$ with an integer leads to non-density, the critical assumption is that $e$ is not an integer. However, $e$ is a specific constant, so perhaps the problem doesn't require stating that, as it's given. But the user's example included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (divisible by 7), which may have been a mistake. So maybe the correct approach here is to list the assumptions as per the problem's explicit statements.\n\nLooking at the original problem again: The user is asking to show that the sequence $e^n \\bmod 1$ is dense in [0,1], where $n$ is in $\\mathbb{N}$. The problem mentions that replacing $e$ with an integer leads to a non-dense sequence. So the problem is to show density for the specific case where the base is $e$, and $n$ ranges over natural numbers. The assumptions would then be:\n\n- $n$ is a natural number.\n- The base of the exponent is $e$.\n\nBut the problem's core is about the properties of $e$, but since $e$ is given, maybe those aren't assumptions. Wait, but in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", and the formatted assumption listed \"n is an integer\". So perhaps here, the assumptions would be:\n\n- $n$ is a natural number.\n- The sequence is defined by $e^n \\bmod 1$.\n\nBut the problem is to prove density, which relies on $e$'s properties. However, the user might not need to list $e$'s properties as assumptions unless they are given in the problem. Since the problem states \"Consider the sequence $e^n \\bmod 1$\", so the base $e$ is part of the problem's setup. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- $n$ is a natural number.\n- The sequence is $e^n \\bmod 1$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nBut perhaps that's redundant. Alternatively, maybe the problem's assumptions are just that $n$ is in $\\mathbb{N}$, and the sequence is as defined. The problem is to prove density in [0,1]. However, the example given by the user included an extra assumption (divisible by 7) not present in the original problem, which suggests that perhaps the user wants to extract implicit assumptions. But in this case, since the problem is to prove density for $e^n \\bmod 1$, and the key is that $e$ is irrational, but that's not stated in the problem. However, the problem does mention that replacing $e$ with an integer (rational) leads to non-density, so the assumption here is that $e$ is not an integer, hence irrational. But since $e$ is known to be irrational, maybe that's considered a given. However, in the problem's context, the user is pointing out that the density requires specific properties of $e$, so perhaps the key assumption is that $e$ is irrational. But does the problem state that $e$ is irrational? No, it's implied by the context. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- $n$ is a natural number.\n- $e$ is an irrational number.\n\nBut the problem doesn't explicitly state that $e$ is irrational; it's part of mathematical knowledge. However, since the problem mentions that using an integer (rational) base doesn't work, the key assumption is that $e$ is not an integer, which is true, but more importantly, that $e$ is irrational. Therefore, to list the assumptions properly, we need to include that $e$ is irrational, even though it's not stated in the problem. Because without that assumption, the problem might not hold. For example, if $e$ were a rational number (which it's not), the sequence might not be dense. Hence, the assumption here is that $e$ is irrational.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n$n$ is a natural number,\n$e$ is an irrational number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the sequence $e^n \\bmod 1$ is dense in $[0,1]$.\n\nBut wait, the original problem's title says \"Prove that $e^n\\bmod 1$ is dense in $[0,1]$\", and the body mentions $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. So the first assumption is $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, and the second is that $e$ is irrational. Even though the problem doesn't state that $e$ is irrational, it's a necessary condition for the proof. However, since the problem explicitly mentions that replacing $e$ with an integer (which is a specific case of a rational number) leads to non-density, the key is that $e$ is not an integer. But more precisely, $e$ is irrational. Therefore, the assumption that $e$ is irrational is necessary.\n\nBut wait, the problem as stated does not make any assumptions about $e$; it's given as $e$, the base of natural logarithm, which is known to be irrational. So perhaps in this context, the problem assumes that $e$ is irrational, and the task is to use that property to prove density. Therefore, the assumptions would include that $e$ is irrational.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is to show that $e^n \\mod 1$ is dense in [0,1] without any assumptions on $e$, but the problem itself mentions that replacing $e$ with an integer makes it non-dense, so the key is that $e$ is not an integer. However, $e$ being not an integer is weaker than being irrational. For example, $e$ could be a non-integer rational, but in reality, $e$ is irrational. So maybe the problem is implicitly using that $e$ is irrational, even though it's not stated. Therefore, the necessary assumptions would be:\n\n- $n$ is a natural number.\n- $e$ is an irrational number.\n\nHence, the formatted problem should include these assumptions.",
