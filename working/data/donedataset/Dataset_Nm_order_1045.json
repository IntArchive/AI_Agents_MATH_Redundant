    "Content": "The problem is the following: Let $a,b,c,d \\in \\mathbb R$ be given such that $a<b$ and $c<d$ . Suppose $f : [a,b] \\times [c,d] \\to \\mathbb R$ is a function such that $\\partial_1 f: [a,b] \\times [c,d] \\to \\mathbb R$ exists and is (Lebesgue-)integrable.\nShow that for $t\\in [a,b]$ we have $$\\frac{\\mathrm d}{\\mathrm dt}\\int_c^d f(t,x) \\, \\mathrm dx = \\int_c^d \\partial_1 f(t,x)\\, \\mathrm dx$$ I have tried the following: By the fundamental theorem of calculus, we have $$f(t',x) - f(t,x) = \\int_{t}^{t'} \\partial_1f(s,x)\\, \\mathrm ds$$ It follows that $$\n\\begin{align}\n\\int_c^d f(t',x)-f(t,x) \\, \\mathrm dx &= \\int_c^d \\int_{t}^{t'} \\partial_1f(s,x)\\, \\mathrm ds \\, \\mathrm dx \\\\\n&= \\int_{t}^{t'} \\int_c^d \\partial_1f(s,x)\\, \\mathrm dx \\, \\mathrm ds\n\\end{align}\n$$ so that for almost all $t$ , we have $$\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\mathrm d}{\\mathrm dt}\\int_c^d f(t,x) \\, \\mathrm dx \n&= \\lim_{t'\\to t} \\frac{1}{t'-t}\\int_c^d f(t',x)-f(t,x) \\, \\mathrm dx \\\\\n&= \\lim_{t'\\to t} \\frac{1}{t'-t}\\int_{t}^{t'} \\int_c^d \\partial_1f(s,x)\\, \\mathrm dx \\, \\mathrm ds \\\\\n&= \\int_c^d \\partial_1f(t,x)\\, \\mathrm dx\n\\end{align}\n$$ since $t \\mapsto \\int_c^d \\partial_1f(t,x)\\, \\mathrm dx$ is an $L^1$ function (hence almost every point $t$ is a Lebesgue-point). Unfortunately equality for almost every $t$ is not good enough in this case. I have been thinking about this for quite a while now, but I cannot figure out the reason for why every point $t\\in [a,b]$ has to be a Lebesgue point of $$t\\mapsto \\int_c^d \\partial_1f(t,x)\\, \\mathrm dx$$ I have also been thinking about possible counterexamples, but couldn't really come up with one. (At least not if one defines $\\frac{\\mathrm d}{\\mathrm dt} \\infty = 0$ for the constant function $\\infty$ ...) Some help would be appreciated, thanks!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You need $\\partial_1f(t,x)$ be dominated by an integrable function, i.e., you need $|\\partial_1f(t,x)|\\le g(x)$ for every $x,t$ for you to take the limit $t'\\to t$ inside the integral for every $t$. Just $\\partial_1f(t,x)$ being integrable over $[c,d]$ for every fixed $t\\in [a,b]$ isn't sufficient. Edit: Let me clarify things here. The problem is that you can not straightaway write $$\\frac{\\mathrm d}{\\mathrm dt}\\int_c^d f(t,x) \\, \\mathrm dx \n= \\lim_{t'\\to t} \\frac{1}{t'-t}\\int_c^d f(t',x)-f(t,x) \\, \\mathrm dx $$ unless you have already shown that $\\int_c^d f(t,x) \\, \\mathrm dx$ is differentiable w.r.to $t$. So, let $t_n$ be a sequence converging to $t$ and let $$g_n(x)=\\frac{f(t_n,x)-f(t,x)}{t_n-t}$$ Then $\\lim g_n(x)=\\partial_1 f(t,x)$ (given). Then by mean value theorem $$|g_n(x)|\\le \\sup_{t\\in [a,b]}|\\partial_1 f(t,x)|\\le g(x)$$ so DCT applies to $g_n(x)$. Therefore $$\\lim_{t_n\\to t} \\frac{1}{t_n-t}\\int_c^d [f(t_n,x)-f(t,x)]\\mathrm dx$$ exists and is equal to $$ \\int_c^d \\lim_{t_n\\to t}\\frac{f(t_n,x)-f(t,x)}{t_n-t}\\mathrm dx=\\int_c^d \\partial_1f(t,x) \\, \\mathrm dx$$ I have just reproduced here what I once learnt from Folland's Real Analysis book.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem properly. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format with assumptions and the problem statement. \n\nFirst, let's look at the original question. The title is about differentiation under the integral sign for Lebesgue integrable derivatives. The problem states: Given real numbers a, b, c, d with a < b and c < d, and a function f: [a,b] × [c,d] → ℝ such that the partial derivative ∂₁f exists and is Lebesgue-integrable. They need to show that for t in [a,b], the derivative of the integral of f(t,x) dx from c to d equals the integral of the partial derivative ∂₁f(t,x) dx over the same interval.\n\nThe user's attempt uses the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and swaps the order of integration, leading to the result almost everywhere. However, they're concerned because the conclusion is only for almost every t, but the problem asks for every t in [a,b]. They wonder if every t is a Lebesgue point or if there's a counterexample.\n\nNow, to format this into the desired structure. The assumptions need to be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object. Let's parse the problem:\n\n1. The domain of f is [a,b] × [c,d], where a < b and c < d. So we have intervals for t and x.\n2. The function f is defined from [a,b] × [c,d] to ℝ.\n3. The partial derivative ∂₁f (with respect to t) exists.\n4. The partial derivative ∂₁f is Lebesgue-integrable on [a,b] × [c,d].\n\nThese are the key assumptions. Each should be a separate line in the Assumption section. The problem is to show the differentiation under the integral sign holds for every t in [a,b], not just almost everywhere.\n\nSo the formatted problem should list these four assumptions, each on their own line, and then state the problem as showing the equality of the derivative of the integral and the integral of the partial derivative for every t in [a,b].\n\nWait, let me check if all these are indeed in the original problem. The user mentions \"given such that a < b and c < d\", so those are the first two intervals. Then f is defined on that product interval. The partial derivative exists and is Lebesgue-integrable. Yes, that's all covered. So each of these should be separate assumptions. \n\nProblem statement: Show that for every t in [a,b], the derivative of the integral of f(t,x) dx from c to d equals the integral of the partial derivative ∂₁f(t,x) dx.\n\nThe user's example in the original problem had assumptions each on separate lines. So here, the four conditions: a < b, c < d, f is defined on [a,b] × [c,d], the partial derivative exists, and the partial derivative is integrable. Wait, but a < b and c < d are two separate conditions, so perhaps list them as separate assumptions. Let me structure that.\n\nAssumptions:\n- a, b, c, d are real numbers with a < b,\n- c < d,\n- f: [a,b] × [c,d] → ℝ is a function,\n- The partial derivative ∂₁f exists on [a,b] × [c,d],\n- ∂₁f is Lebesgue-integrable on [a,b] × [c,d].\n\nBut the original problem says \"given such that a < b and c < d\". So maybe combine the first two points as one? Or split them? The example given by the user in the original example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate lines. So here, since a < b and c < d are separate conditions, they should be separate assumptions.\n\nSo each assumption line addresses only one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\na and b are real numbers with a < b,\nc and d are real numbers with c < d,\nf is a function from [a,b] × [c,d] to ℝ,\n∂₁f exists on [a,b] × [c,d],\n∂₁f is Lebesgue-integrable on [a,b] × [c,d].\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each line is one condition. Then the problem is to show the differentiation under the integral sign for every t in [a,b].\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \na and b are real numbers with $a < b$,\nc and d are real numbers with $c < d$,\n$f : [a,b] \\times [c,d] \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a function,\nthe partial derivative $\\partial_1 f$ exists on $[a,b] \\times [c,d]$,\n$\\partial_1 f$ is Lebesgue-integrable on $[a,b] \\times [c,d]$.\nProblem:\nShow that for every $t \\in [a,b]$, $$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\int_c^d f(t,x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x = \\int_c^d \\partial_1 f(t,x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x.$$\n###",
