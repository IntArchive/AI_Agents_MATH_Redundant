    "Content": "I have been having a lot of trouble teaching myself rings, so much so that even \"simple\" proofs are really difficult for me. I think I am finally starting to get it, but just to be sure could some one please check this proof that $\\mathbb Z[i]/\\langle 1 - i \\rangle$ is a field. Thank you. Proof: Notice that $$\\langle 1 - i \\rangle\\\\ \n\\Rightarrow 1 = i\\\\\n \\Rightarrow 2 = 0.$$\nThus all elements of the form $a+ bi + \\langle 1 - i \\rangle$ can be rewritten as $a+ b + \\langle 1 - i \\rangle$. But since $2=0$ this implies that the elements that are left can be written as $1 + \\langle 1 - i \\rangle$ or $0 + \\langle 1 - i \\rangle$. Thus \n$$\n\\mathbb Z[i]/ \\langle 1 - i \\rangle = \\{ 0+ \\langle 1 - i \\rangle , 1 + \\langle 1 - i \\rangle\\}.\n$$ This is obviously a commutative ring with unity and no zero-divisors, thus it is a finite integral domain, and hence is a field. $\\square$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Your answer is great, but I'd like to give a different view as well. A standard first or second example of a Euclidean Domain is the Gaussian integers $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$, so that in particular the Gaussian integers form a principal ideal domain. We also know that in PIDs, nonzero prime ideals are maximal. So if we were to show that $1 - i$ is a Gaussian prime, then $\\langle 1 - i \\rangle$ would be a prime ideal, and thus a maximal ideal. Thus, quotienting by it would give a field. So how do we show that $1 - i$ is prime? Well, compute its norm (from the Euclidean Domain norm, where $|x + iy| = x^2 + y^2$. Its norm is $2$. Norms are multiplicative, so if $1-i = ab$, then $2 = |a||b|$. But its norm is also an integer, and $2$ is a prime (in the reals). Thus $1-i$ is a prime. And so we have it.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants to prove that the quotient ring ℤ[i]/⟨1 - i⟩ is a field. First, I need to recall some concepts about rings, ideals, and quotient rings. \n\nSo, ℤ[i] is the ring of Gaussian integers, which are complex numbers of the form a + bi where a and b are integers. The ideal ⟨1 - i⟩ is generated by the element 1 - i in this ring. To show that the quotient ring is a field, I know that a field is a commutative ring with unity where every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. Another approach is that if the ideal is maximal, then the quotient ring is a field. So, maybe I need to check if ⟨1 - i⟩ is a maximal ideal in ℤ[i].\n\nBut the user's proof takes a different route. They start by noting that in the quotient ring, 1 - i is equivalent to 0, which implies that 1 ≡ i. Then, they derive that 2 ≡ 0 in the quotient. Then, they argue that every element a + bi can be simplified to a + b because i ≡ 1. Since 2 ≡ 0, the coefficients reduce modulo 2. So, the elements are either 0 + ⟨1 - i⟩ or 1 + ⟨1 - i⟩. Thus, the quotient ring has two elements, which is isomorphic to the field with two elements, hence it's a field.\n\nWait, but let me verify this. If the quotient ring has two elements, then it's indeed a field because the only finite integral domains are fields. However, I need to make sure that all steps are correct. Let's check each part.\n\nFirst, in the quotient ring ℤ[i]/⟨1 - i⟩, the generator 1 - i is equal to 0. Therefore, 1 ≡ i. Then, squaring both sides, i² ≡ 1² ⇒ -1 ≡ 1 ⇒ 1 + 1 ≡ 0 ⇒ 2 ≡ 0. So, 2 is in the ideal. Therefore, in the quotient ring, any element a + bi can be written as a + b(1) because i ≡ 1. So, that becomes a + b. But since 2 ≡ 0, a + b is equivalent modulo 2. Therefore, the elements are either 0 or 1 modulo ⟨1 - i⟩. Hence, there are only two elements, which is the field of two elements, 𝔽₂.\n\nBut is this accurate? Let me think. When they reduce a + bi to a + b, since i ≡ 1, that part makes sense. Then, since coefficients are integers, and 2 ≡ 0, then a + b must be considered modulo 2. So, yes, if a + b is even, it's equivalent to 0, and if odd, equivalent to 1. Therefore, the quotient ring has two elements, which is a field. \n\nHowever, I should verify if the ideal ⟨1 - i⟩ is indeed equal to the ideal generated by 2 in ℤ[i], because if 2 is in the ideal, then perhaps ⟨1 - i⟩ also contains other elements. Wait, but 1 - i divides 2? Let me check. (1 - i)(1 + i) = 1 + i - i - i² = 1 - (-1) = 2. So, 2 is indeed a multiple of 1 - i. Therefore, ⟨1 - i⟩ contains 2. So, in the quotient ring, 2 becomes 0. Therefore, the characteristic is 2. \n\nSo, combining this, in the quotient, every element is a + b mod 2, hence only 0 and 1. Therefore, the ring has two elements, and since 1 is not zero, and there are no zero divisors, it's a field. \n\nAlternatively, another way to see this is that ℤ[i] is a PID (since it's a Euclidean domain), so to check if ⟨1 - i⟩ is maximal, we need to see if 1 - i is irreducible. But 1 - i has norm (1)^2 + (-1)^2 = 2, which is prime in ℤ. Therefore, 1 - i is irreducible, hence ⟨1 - i⟩ is a maximal ideal, so the quotient is a field. \n\nSo, the user's approach is correct, but perhaps the assumptions need to be structured. The problem is to prove that ℤ[i]/⟨1 - i⟩ is a field. The key assumptions are:\n\n- The ring in question is ℤ[i], the Gaussian integers.\n- The ideal is generated by 1 - i.\n- The quotient ring ℤ[i]/⟨1 - i⟩ is being considered.\n- The user's proof uses that 1 ≡ i in the quotient, leading to 2 ≡ 0.\n- Then, elements are reduced modulo 2, leading to a two-element ring, which is a field.\n\nSo, for the assumptions, we need to list the properties or conditions applied to each object. The main objects here are ℤ[i], the ideal ⟨1 - i⟩, and the quotient ring. \n\nPossible assumptions:\n\n- ℤ[i] is the ring of Gaussian integers.\n- ⟨1 - i⟩ is an ideal in ℤ[i].\n- The quotient ring ℤ[i]/⟨1 - i⟩ is considered.\n- In the quotient ring, 1 - i is equivalent to 0.\n- In the quotient ring, 2 is equivalent to 0.\n\nBut the problem statement is to prove that the quotient ring is a field, so the assumptions needed would be the basic setup. The user's proof doesn't make any additional assumptions beyond the problem's setup. However, in the example given earlier, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is to prove the quotient is a field. So, the main assumption is that we're working within the ring ℤ[i] and taking the quotient by ⟨1 - i⟩. \n\nBut maybe the problem doesn't need any additional assumptions beyond the definitions. However, perhaps to clarify, the problem is about the quotient ring, so the assumptions would be:\n\n- ℤ[i] is the ring of Gaussian integers.\n- ⟨1 - i⟩ is an ideal of ℤ[i].\n- The problem is to prove that the quotient ring ℤ[i]/⟨1 - i⟩ is a field.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumption lists conditions applied to one object each. For example, in the example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Each applies to one object (n) with different conditions.\n\nIn this problem, maybe the key assumptions are:\n\n- ℤ[i] is a ring.\n- ⟨1 - i⟩ is an ideal of ℤ[i].\n- The problem is to prove ℤ[i]/⟨1 - i⟩ is a field.\n\nBut perhaps more precisely, the assumption here is that we are working in the ring ℤ[i], and considering the ideal generated by 1 - i. However, since the problem is directly stated as proving the quotient is a field, maybe the only assumption is that the quotient is taken with respect to the ideal ⟨1 - i⟩. \n\nAlternatively, looking back at the example, the assumptions listed were properties of the variables involved. Here, the objects are the ring and the ideal. But since the user's proof uses properties like 1 ≡ i leading to 2 ≡ 0, perhaps these are steps in the proof rather than assumptions. \n\nSo, when structuring the problem, the assumptions should be the given conditions. The problem is to prove that the quotient ring is a field. The given conditions are:\n\n- The ring is ℤ[i].\n- The ideal is ⟨1 - i⟩.\n- The quotient ring ℤ[i]/⟨1 - i⟩ is considered.\n\nBut according to the example format, each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nℤ[i] is the ring of Gaussian integers,\n⟨1 - i⟩ is an ideal of ℤ[i],\nthe problem considers the quotient ring ℤ[i]/⟨1 - i⟩.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about the variable n. Here, maybe the key assumption is that we are working with the quotient of ℤ[i] by the ideal generated by 1 - i. So, the assumptions could be phrased as:\n\n- The ring ℤ[i] is considered,\n- The ideal ⟨1 - i⟩ is considered,\n- The quotient ring ℤ[i]/⟨1 - i⟩ is constructed.\n\nHowever, the problem as posed doesn't have additional conditions beyond the construction of the quotient ring. So perhaps the assumptions are just that we're dealing with ℤ[i]/⟨1 - i⟩. \n\nBut looking at the example again, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted assumption listed that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. However, the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7; that was part of the solution's approach. Wait, no, in the example, the formatted problem actually had a mistake. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like an error. Because the original problem didn't assume n is divisible by 7; it was for every integer n, so the divisibility by 91 must hold regardless. However, in the formatted problem, the user included \"n is divisible by 7\", which is incorrect. Therefore, the example might have a mistake, but the user provided it as an example of how to structure.\n\nBut in the current problem, we have to follow the format as per the example. So, perhaps in this case, the assumptions would be the necessary conditions to set up the problem, even if they are inherent in the problem statement. For example, the problem statement is about ℤ[i]/⟨1 - i⟩, so the assumptions would be:\n\n- ℤ[i] is a ring,\n- ⟨1 - i⟩ is an ideal of ℤ[i],\n- The quotient ring ℤ[i]/⟨1 - i⟩ is considered.\n\nBut perhaps more concisely, since the problem is to prove the quotient is a field, the main assumption is that we are working with the quotient ring ℤ[i]/⟨1 - i⟩. However, according to the example, assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So, here, the objects are ℤ[i], the ideal ⟨1 - i⟩, and the quotient ring. Each assumption should be a single property.\n\nTherefore, possible assumptions:\n\n- ℤ[i] is the ring of Gaussian integers,\n- ⟨1 - i⟩ is an ideal in ℤ[i],\n- The problem considers the quotient ring ℤ[i]/⟨1 - i⟩.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that this quotient ring is a field. So, the problem statement is as given, and the assumptions are the setup. The user's proof uses properties like 1 - i being in the ideal, hence leading to 1 ≡ i and 2 ≡ 0. But these are part of the proof, not assumptions. Therefore, the assumptions for the problem are just the basic setup: the ring, the ideal, and the quotient.\n\nHence, formatted as:\n\nAssumption:\nℤ[i] is the ring of Gaussian integers,\n⟨1 - i⟩ is an ideal of ℤ[i],\nthe problem considers the quotient ring ℤ[i]/⟨1 - i⟩.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ℤ[i]/⟨1 - i⟩ is a field.\n\nBut in the example, the assumption listed properties about the variable (n is integer, n divisible by 7). Here, the assumptions are about the structures involved. However, the example might have been incorrectly formatted, but we need to follow it. Alternatively, maybe the assumptions should include the key steps that are necessary for the problem, but that's part of the proof.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumption is simply that ⟨1 - i⟩ is an ideal in ℤ[i], and the problem is to prove the quotient is a field. However, the problem as stated in the question already says \"Help with proof that ℤ[i]/⟨1 - i⟩ is a field.\" So the formatted problem should have the problem as \"Prove that ℤ[i]/⟨1 - i⟩ is a field.\" and the assumptions are the necessary conditions for that problem. But since the problem is self-contained, maybe the assumptions are implicit. However, the example included assumptions even though the original problem didn't state them. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. That seems incorrect. The original problem said \"for every integer n\", so there's no assumption that n is divisible by 7. Therefore, the example might have been flawed, but the user wants us to follow that format regardless.\n\nGiven that, perhaps in this current problem, even though the original problem is to prove ℤ[i]/⟨1 - i⟩ is a field, the assumptions would include things like \"1 - i generates an ideal in ℤ[i]\" and \"ℤ[i] is a ring\", etc. However, since the problem is stated in the context of ring theory, perhaps these are considered given. But to follow the example, we might need to list the assumptions as:\n\nAssumption:\nℤ[i] is a commutative ring,\n⟨1 - i⟩ is an ideal of ℤ[i],\nthe quotient ring ℤ[i]/⟨1 - i⟩ is considered.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ℤ[i]/⟨1 - i⟩ is a field.\n\nBut maybe more precise. Alternatively, since in the example, the assumption listed a condition on n (divisible by 7), which was part of the solution, not the problem. But that seems like a mistake. However, perhaps in this problem, the key assumption is that we are working in the ring ℤ[i], and taking the quotient by the ideal generated by 1 - i. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nℤ[i] is the ring of Gaussian integers,\n⟨1 - i⟩ is an ideal in ℤ[i].\n\nProblem:\nProve that the quotient ring ℤ[i]/⟨1 - i⟩ is a field.\n\nAlternatively, the quotient ring is part of the problem statement, so maybe the assumptions are only about the ring and the ideal. \n\nGiven the example's structure, even if it had an error, we need to replicate the format. In the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption included \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". However, the original problem didn't restrict n to be divisible by 7; it was a general statement. So the formatted example incorrectly added an assumption. Despite that, we need to follow the user's format. \n\nTherefore, in this problem, the original question is to prove that ℤ[i]/⟨1 - i⟩ is a field. The assumptions needed for the problem are the basic setup:\n\n- ℤ[i] is the ring of Gaussian integers,\n- ⟨1 - i⟩ is an ideal in ℤ[i],\n- The quotient ring ℤ[i]/⟨1 - i⟩ is considered.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nℤ[i] is a ring,\n⟨1 - i⟩ is an ideal of ℤ[i],\nthe quotient ring ℤ[i]/⟨1 - i⟩ is considered.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ℤ[i]/⟨1 - i⟩ is a field.\n\nHowever, \"the quotient ring ℤ[i]/⟨1 - i⟩ is considered\" is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Maybe the assumptions are more about the properties of the objects involved. For example:\n\nAssumption:\nℤ[i] is a commutative ring with unity,\n⟨1 - i⟩ is a prime ideal in ℤ[i].\n\nBut the problem is to prove it's a field, not assuming it's a prime ideal. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the assumptions are just the given structures:\n\nAssumption:\nThe ring ℤ[i] is considered,\nthe ideal ⟨1 - i⟩ is considered.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the quotient ring ℤ[i]/⟨1 - i⟩ is a field.\n\nBut how does this align with the example? The example took the original problem which had no restriction on n, but the formatted problem included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which is incorrect. So perhaps the user wants to extract key conditions from the problem. However, in this case, the problem is to prove a property of a specific quotient ring, so the key assumption is that we're working with that quotient ring. But since the example included assumptions even when not stated, perhaps we need to follow suit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are derived from the problem's context. For instance, in the user's proof, they use that 2 = 0 in the quotient ring. So perhaps the assumptions include that 2 is congruent to 0 modulo the ideal. But that's part of the proof, not the problem's assumption.\n\nGiven the ambiguity in the example, perhaps the safest way is to list the assumptions as:\n\nAssumption:\nℤ[i] is the ring of Gaussian integers,\n⟨1 - i⟩ is an ideal of ℤ[i].\n\nProblem:\nProve that the quotient ring ℤ[i]/⟨1 - i⟩ is a field.\n\nThis way, each assumption is a single property applied to one object. The first line states the nature of ℤ[i], the second line states the ideal in question.",
