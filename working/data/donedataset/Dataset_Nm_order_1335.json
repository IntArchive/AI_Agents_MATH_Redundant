    "Content": "I want to show that if $f\\colon [0,1]\\to\\mathbb{R}$ is continuous and \n$xf(y)+yf(x)\\leq 1$ for all $x,y\\in[0,1]$\nthen we have the following inequality:\n$$\\int_0^1 f(x) \\, dx\\leq\\frac{\\pi}{4}.$$ The $\\pi$ on the right hand side suggests we have to do something with a geometric function. Letting $f(x) = \\frac{1}{1+x^2}$ we have equality but this function does not satisfy $xf(y)+yf(x)\\leq 1$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $I = \\displaystyle\\int_{0}^{1}f(x)\\,dx$. Substituting $x = \\sin \\theta$ yields $I = \\displaystyle\\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}f(\\sin \\theta)\\cos\\theta\\,d\\theta$. Substituting $x = \\cos \\theta$ yields $I = \\displaystyle\\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}f(\\cos \\theta)\\sin\\theta\\,d\\theta$. Hence, $I = \\dfrac{1}{2}\\displaystyle\\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}\\left[f(\\sin \\theta)\\cos\\theta+f(\\cos\\theta)\\sin\\theta\\right]\\,d\\theta \\le \\dfrac{1}{2}\\displaystyle\\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}1\\,d\\theta = \\dfrac{\\pi}{4}$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem and structure it according to the required format. \n\nFirst, the problem is about showing an integral inequality given a functional constraint. The user wants the assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. \n\nLooking at the original question: The function f is defined on the interval [0,1] and maps to real numbers. The first condition is that f is continuous. The second condition is that for all x and y in [0,1], the expression xf(y) + yf(x) is less than or equal to 1. The goal is to prove that the integral of f(x) from 0 to 1 is at most π/4.\n\nSo, breaking down the assumptions:\n\n1. The domain of f is [0,1]. The problem states \"f: [0,1] → ℝ\", so that's one assumption about the domain and codomain.\n2. f is continuous. The problem explicitly mentions \"f is continuous\".\n3. For all x and y in [0,1], the inequality xf(y) + yf(x) ≤ 1 holds. This is a separate condition that applies to pairs (x,y).\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The problem then is to show the integral is ≤ π/4. The example given in the problem uses a specific function (1/(1+x²)) which achieves equality but doesn't satisfy the condition, so that's part of the motivation but not part of the assumptions. The key is to extract only the given conditions from the problem statement.\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is listed separately. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- f is a function from [0,1] to ℝ,\n- f is continuous on [0,1],\n- For all x, y in [0,1], xf(y) + yf(x) ≤ 1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ∫₀¹ f(x) dx ≤ π/4.\n\nWait, but in the example provided, the assumptions are listed with each on a new line. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. However, in the original problem here, the assumptions are about the function f. So each bullet point is an assumption.\n\nSo yes, breaking down each condition into separate lines. The problem statement is the integral inequality.",
