    "Content": "I was recently asked by a student whether there exists a topological space which is not compact, but in which every proper open subset is compact. I haven't been able to give an example, or a proof that no such space exists. So far the best I've been able to show is that such a space cannot contain a closed compact subset (in particular, it cannot be T1).",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Consider $\\Bbb N$, with proper open sets given by $U_n = \\{x: x\\le n\\}$ and the empty set.  Arbitrary unions of the $U_n$ are open, (either given by $U_{m}$ the maximum of the $n$ or by $\\Bbb N$ if the $n$ are unbounded), as too are finite intersections. Here every proper open set is finite, and thus trivially compact.  However, it is easy to see that $\\Bbb N$ itself is not compact with this topology, since it is covered by the collection of all proper open subsets, which admits no finite subcover.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to understand this problem. The user is asking if there exists a topological space that isn't compact, but every proper open subset of it is compact. They mentioned that they couldn't find an example or prove it's impossible. Also, they noted that such a space can't have a closed compact subset, especially not being T1.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question accurately. The key points are: the space is not compact, but every proper open subset is compact. So, the entire space X is non-compact, but if you take any open set U that's not equal to X itself, then U is compact.\n\nWait, the problem says \"every proper open subset is compact\". So a proper open subset means an open set that is not the entire space. So the entire space is excluded, and all other open subsets must be compact.\n\nNow, the user wants this formatted into the specified structure. The example given shows that assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo, for this problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. The space is not compact.\n2. Every proper open subset of the space is compact.\n\nBut wait, in the example provided, the assumption was split into two lines: \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, the two conditions are separate. Similarly, here the two conditions are that the space is not compact, and that every proper open subset is compact. So each should be a separate assumption.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe topological space is not compact.\nEvery proper open subset of the topological space is compact.\n\nProblem:\nProve whether there exists a topological space which is not compact, but every proper open subset is compact.\n\nWait, but the original question was phrased as \"∃ a non-compact space in which every proper open subset is compact?\" So the problem is to determine existence. But in the example, the problem was to \"Prove that...\". So here, the problem would be to \"Prove whether there exists...\" or \"Determine the existence of...\". But the example used \"Prove that...\", which is an instruction, whereas here it's a question of existence. Hmm.\n\nBut the user's example had the problem statement as \"Prove that...\", so perhaps here the problem should be phrased as \"Prove whether there exists a topological space which is not compact, but every proper open subset is compact.\" Alternatively, \"Determine if there exists a topological space that is not compact, in which every proper open subset is compact.\"\n\nBut the original question is \"∃ a non-compact space in which every proper open subset is compact?\" So perhaps the problem statement should be \"Prove that there exists a non-compact topological space in which every proper open subset is compact, or prove that no such space exists.\"\n\nBut the user's example had \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\", so maybe here the problem is \"Prove whether there exists a non-compact topological space in which every proper open subset is compact.\"\n\nWait, the user's instruction says to structure the problem as per the example. The example took the original problem and filtered out the unrelated information. In the original problem here, the user mentions that they showed such a space cannot contain a closed compact subset and cannot be T1. But those might be the user's attempts, not part of the problem's assumptions. The actual problem is the question: existence of such a space. So the assumptions would be the two conditions: space not compact, every proper open subset is compact. The problem is to prove existence or non-existence.\n\nWait, the example given by the user took the original problem's assumptions (n is integer, and in the original problem, n was supposed to be divisible by 7? Wait, the original example had \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, the assumptions were n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems inconsistent. Wait, perhaps the example was modified? Let me check.\n\nOriginal problem in the example: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91. Then the formatted problem's assumption was n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that's a mistake, right? Because 91 is 13*7, so maybe the original problem had n being divisible by 7, but in the example given, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added that assumption. So perhaps there was a mistake there. However, the user is providing that example as their own structure, so we have to follow their format even if there's an error.\n\nBut in any case, the task is to take the original question from Math Stack Exchange, filter out unrelated information (like the user's attempts, mentions of their student, etc.), and structure it into the assumption and problem parts.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question is: \"Exists a non-compact space in which every proper open subset is compact?\" So the problem is to determine existence. But in the example, the problem was to prove something. So perhaps here the problem statement is: \"Prove whether there exists a topological space which is not compact, but in which every proper open subset is compact.\"\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be phrased as \"Determine if there exists a non-compact topological space where every proper open subset is compact.\"\n\nBut the example's problem starts with \"Prove that...\", so maybe here it should be similar. However, since the original question is about existence, perhaps it's better to phrase it as \"Prove that there exists a non-compact topological space in which every proper open subset is compact, or prove that no such space exists.\" But that might be too verbose.\n\nAlternatively, just state the problem as: \"Prove whether there exists a topological space which is not compact, but every proper open subset is compact.\"\n\nBut \"prove whether\" is a bit non-standard. Maybe \"Determine whether there exists...\" but the example uses \"Prove that...\", so perhaps in the problem statement, we need to frame it as a proof request. Since the original question is asking for existence, perhaps the problem is to \"Prove that there exists a non-compact topological space in which every proper open subset is compact.\" But if the answer is that such a space doesn't exist, then the problem would be incorrect. Alternatively, the problem is to determine existence, so maybe the problem should be \"Prove or disprove: There exists a non-compact topological space in which every proper open subset is compact.\"\n\nBut the example didn't use \"prove or disprove\", but the problem structure in the example had the user's problem as \"Prove that...\". However, the user's original problem here is a question of existence, so it's more of a \"prove or disprove\" type. But perhaps the problem statement can be phrased as: \"Prove that there exists a non-compact topological space in which every proper open subset is compact.\" But if the answer is that no such space exists, then the problem would be to prove that. But given the user's problem is a yes/no question, perhaps the problem statement should reflect that.\n\nWait, the original title was \"∃ a non-compact space in which every proper open subset is compact?\" So the problem is to determine if such a space exists. The way to structure that into the problem part would be \"Prove whether there exists a non-compact topological space in which every proper open subset is compact.\" But the example used \"Prove that...\", so maybe we need to follow that structure, even if it's a yes/no question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is \"Show that there exists a non-compact topological space where every proper open subset is compact, or show that no such space exists.\"\n\nBut perhaps the problem statement should be as concise as possible, mirroring the original question but in the format. So:\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists a non-compact topological space in which every proper open subset is compact.\n\nBut the problem is to determine existence, not necessarily to prove existence. The user is unsure whether such a space exists. So maybe the problem is: \"Prove or disprove the existence of a non-compact topological space in which every proper open subset is compact.\"\n\nHowever, looking back at the example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n...\" and the formatted problem kept that as \"Prove that...\". So perhaps in this case, even though the original question is \"exists...?\", the problem should be phrased as \"Prove that there exists...\" even though the answer might be that it does not exist, requiring a disproof. But maybe the user wants the problem statement to reflect the original question's intent, which is to ask for existence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem statement is exactly as the title: \"∃ a non-compact space in which every proper open subset is compact?\" But in LaTeX, that would be \"Does there exist a non-compact space in which every proper open subset is compact?\"\n\nBut the example used \"Prove that...\", so perhaps here the problem statement is \"Prove whether there exists a non-compact topological space in which every proper open subset is compact.\" However, \"prove whether\" is not standard. Usually, it's \"Prove or disprove: There exists...\".\n\nGiven the example, maybe the assistant should follow the structure but adjust the problem statement to fit. Since the example took the original problem's statement and rephrased it into a \"Prove that...\" format, perhaps here the problem is \"Prove that there exists a non-compact topological space in which every proper open subset is compact.\"\n\nHowever, the original problem is a question, not a statement. So perhaps the correct way is to rephrase it as a directive: \"Determine whether there exists a non-compact topological space in which every proper open subset is compact.\" But the example used \"Prove that...\", so maybe the assistant should follow that.\n\nBut given the ambiguity, perhaps the safest way is to take the core of the question, filter out the student's attempts and other info, and present it as a problem to prove existence or not. The original question is asking for existence, so the problem is \"Prove that there exists a non-compact topological space in which every proper open subset is compact, or prove that no such space exists.\" But that's wordy. Alternatively, \"Determine the existence of a non-compact topological space where every proper open subset is compact.\"\n\nBut the example's problem was a single statement to prove. Since this is a yes/no question, perhaps the problem should be phrased as \"Prove or disprove: There exists a non-compact topological space in which every proper open subset is compact.\" That seems appropriate.\n\nBut the user's example didn't use \"prove or disprove\", so maybe the assistant should stick to the original phrasing. The original question was \"∃ a non-compact space in which every proper open subset is compact?\" So the problem is to answer that question, which is to prove existence or non-existence. But in the problem statement, how to present that.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is \"Prove that there exists a non-compact topological space in which every proper open subset is compact.\" But if such a space doesn't exist, then the problem would be incorrect, but the user is asking whether it exists, so the problem should be to determine that.\n\nBut given the format example, which transformed the original problem into a \"Prove that...\" statement, perhaps here it's better to structure the problem as \"Prove whether there exists a non-compact topological space in which every proper open subset is compact.\" Even though \"prove whether\" is not standard, but perhaps that's acceptable based on the example.\n\nAlternatively, use \"Determine whether there exists...\", which is more accurate.\n\nBut considering the example, the user might prefer \"Prove that...\", but given the original problem is a question, maybe the problem is exactly as posed: \"Prove that there exists a non-compact topological space in which every proper open subset is compact, or that no such space exists.\"\n\nBut perhaps the user wants the problem to be presented as the original question, but structured. So:\n\nProblem: Does there exist a non-compact topological space in which every proper open subset is compact?\n\nBut the example used \"Prove that...\", so maybe the user wants the problem to be an imperative, not a question. So perhaps:\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists a non-compact topological space in which every proper open subset is compact.\n\nBut if the answer is that no such space exists, then the problem statement would be misleading. However, the original question is asking for existence, so the problem is to determine that. But since the example used \"Prove that...\", maybe we need to follow suit. However, in the example, the original problem was a statement to prove, whereas here it's a question. So perhaps the correct approach is to rephrase the question as a proof directive.\n\nAlternatively, take the core of the question and frame it as a proof problem. For example, the problem could be \"Construct an example of a non-compact topological space in which every proper open subset is compact, or prove that no such space exists.\" But \"construct or prove\" is more precise.\n\nBut given the example, the problem was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" So in that case, even if the problem is an existence question, the formatted problem is \"Prove that...\". So perhaps here, the formatted problem should be \"Prove that there exists a non-compact topological space in which every proper open subset is compact.\"\n\nHowever, the user's original question includes their own attempts, like showing such a space can't contain a closed compact subset and can't be T1. But those are part of their attempt, not part of the problem's assumptions. Therefore, when structuring, we need to filter those out. The problem's assumptions are just the two conditions: the space is not compact, and every proper open subset is compact. The problem is to prove existence.\n\nBut wait, the original problem's title is the question, and the body adds the user's attempts. So the assumptions for the problem are only the two conditions, and the problem is to prove existence.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nThe topological space is not compact.\nEvery proper open subset of the topological space is compact.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a topological space which is not compact, but in which every proper open subset is compact.\n\nBut given that the problem is whether such a space exists, it's more accurate to frame it as \"Prove or disprove the existence...\", but the example used \"Prove that...\", so maybe the user expects \"Prove that...\" even if the actual answer requires disproving. Alternatively, maybe the problem statement is as in the title, which is a yes/no question.\n\nBut following the example's structure, which took the original problem (which was a statement to prove) and rephrased it into the problem line, here the original problem is a question, so perhaps the problem line is the question itself, using the original title: \"∃ a non-compact space in which every proper open subset is compact?\"\n\nBut in LaTeX, that would be \"Does there exist a non-compact space in which every proper open subset is compact?\"\n\nBut the example used \"Prove that...\", so perhaps the problem line should be an imperative. Therefore, the problem is to \"Prove whether there exists...\" but \"prove whether\" is awkward. Alternatively, \"Determine the existence of...\" which is better.\n\nBut to stick to the example's structure, perhaps the problem is phrased as \"Prove that there exists a non-compact topological space in which every proper open subset is compact.\"\n\nEven if the answer is no, the problem is presented as a statement to prove, which the answer would then refute. However, the user is asking for help structuring the problem, not the answer. So the formatted problem should capture the original question accurately, regardless of the eventual answer.\n\nGiven that, the assumptions are:\n\n1. The topological space is not compact.\n2. Every proper open subset of the topological space is compact.\n\nThe problem is to prove whether such a space exists.\n\nBut in the example, the problem was a direct statement, so here perhaps:\n\nProblem: Prove whether there exists a topological space which is not compact, but every proper open subset is compact.\n\nAlternatively, since \"prove whether\" is not standard, and the user's example used \"Prove that...\", perhaps the problem is:\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists a non-compact topological space in which every proper open subset is compact.\n\nEven though the actual answer might involve disproving it, the problem as structured by the user's example might prefer the imperative form. The key is that the problem part is the core question stripped of extraneous details.\n\nSo, after filtering out the user's attempts (the part about showing no closed compact subsets, etc.), the structured problem would have the two assumptions and the problem statement as above.\n\nThus, the final formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe topological space is not compact.\nEvery proper open subset of the topological space is compact.\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a topological space which is not compact, but in which every proper open subset is compact.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is better phrased as \"Prove or disprove: There exists a non-compact topological space in which every proper open subset is compact.\" However, given the example's structure, which used \"Prove that...\", I think the user wants the problem part to be a statement to prove, even if the original is a question. Alternatively, the problem could be \"Determine whether there exists a non-compact topological space where every proper open subset is compact.\"\n\nBut to strictly follow the example, which rephrased the original problem into a \"Prove that...\" statement, I think the problem here would be \"Prove that there exists a non-compact topological space in which every proper open subset is compact.\"\n\nEven if the answer is negative, the problem is framed as a statement to prove, which the user would then have to address. However, considering the original question is asking for existence, it's more accurate to present it as a question to resolve, not as a direct statement. But given the example's format, perhaps the problem is phrased as the original title in statement form.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is exactly the title: \"Exists a non-compact space in which every proper open subset is compact?\" But in the example, the problem was rephrased to remove the question mark and make it a statement. For instance, the original example had \"Prove that for every integer n...\" which was kept as is.\n\nSo perhaps here, the problem is \"Prove that there exists a non-compact topological space in which every proper open subset is compact.\"\n\nBut the user might have intended to ask whether such a space exists, so the problem is to determine existence. Therefore, the most accurate problem statement would be \"Determine whether there exists a non-compact topological space in which every proper open subset is compact.\"\n\nBut since the example used \"Prove that...\", maybe we need to use a similar verb. In research mathematics, such problems are often framed as \"Prove or disprove\", but if the example didn't use that, perhaps the assistant should stick to \"Prove that...\".\n\nHowever, considering the user's example, the original problem was a statement to prove, and the formatted problem was also a statement to prove. In this case, the original problem is a question, so the formatted problem should be a question. But the example's problem was not a question. This is a bit conflicting.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I think the best approach is to present the problem as a direct translation of the original question into the format, using the assumptions and problem line. The original question is \"Exists a non-compact space in which every proper open subset is compact?\" So the problem line is that question, properly formatted.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe topological space is not compact.\nEvery proper open subset of the topological space is compact.\nProblem:\nDoes there exist a non-compact topological space in which every proper open subset is compact?\n\nBut in the example, the problem was a statement, not a question. However, the example's original problem was a statement to prove, while here it's a question. So perhaps the problem line should remain a question.\n\nBut the user's instructions say to structure the problem in the given format, which in the example was a statement. Therefore, perhaps the problem line should be a statement to prove, even if it's a yes/no question. For example, if the answer is yes, then \"Prove that there exists...\" is appropriate. If the answer is no, then \"Prove that no such space exists.\"\n\nBut since the answer isn't known a priori, perhaps the problem should be phrased as \"Prove or disprove the existence...\", but the example didn't use that. Therefore, given the example's structure, I'll proceed with the problem line as \"Prove that there exists a non-compact topological space in which every proper open subset is compact,\" understanding that the answer may involve showing that no such space exists, thus contradicting the problem statement. However, this is a risk, but following the example's format.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply the original question's title in LaTeX:\n\nProblem: $\\exists$ a non-compact space in which every proper open subset is compact?\n\nBut the example used a statement, so perhaps not.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the correct formatted problem should capture the original question's essence while following the example's structure. The example took the original problem (a statement to prove) and listed assumptions. Here, the original problem is a yes/no question, so the problem line should reflect that. However, the example used \"Prove that...\", so maybe we need to adjust.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be phrased as \"Prove that such a space exists or does not exist.\" But that's more of a meta-statement.\n\nGiven all this, the best approach is:\n\nAssumption:\nThe topological space is not compact.\nEvery proper open subset of the topological space is compact.\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a non-compact topological space in which every proper open subset is compact.\n\nEven if the answer is negative, the problem is structured as a statement to prove, following the example. The user's attempt to answer might involve showing no such space exists, but the problem structure is as per the user's instructions.",
