    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $a_1, a_2, a_3$ and $a_4$ be a permutation of $a, b, c$ and $d$ such that $a_1 \\leqslant a_2 \\leqslant a_3 \\leqslant a_4.$ It follows from the rearrangement inequality that $$\\frac{a}{b+3}+\\frac{b}{c+3}+\\frac{c}{d+3}+\\frac{d}{a+3} \\leqslant \\frac{a_1}{a_4+3}+\\frac{a_2}{a_3+3}+\\frac{a_3}{a_2+3}+\\frac{a_4}{a_1+3}.$$ A bit later I'm going to prove that $\\displaystyle \\forall x,y \\in [0,2] \\;\\; \\frac{x}{y+3}+\\frac{y}{x+3} \\leqslant \\frac{3}{32}x^2+\\frac{3}{32}y^2+\\frac{5}{16}.$ Assuming it's true your inequality can be solved pretty quickly: $$\\frac{a_1}{a_4+3}+\\frac{a_2}{a_3+3}+\\frac{a_3}{a_2+3}+\\frac{a_4}{a_1+3} \\leqslant \\left(\\frac{3}{32}a_1^2+\\frac{3}{32}a_4^2+\\frac{5}{16}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{3}{32}a_2^2+\\frac{3}{32}a_3^2+\\frac{5}{16}\\right) = \\frac{3}{32}\\bigl(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + a_3^2 + a_4^2\\bigr)+\\frac{5}{8}=\\frac{3}{8}+\\frac{5}{8}=1$$ Lemma. $\\displaystyle \\frac{x}{y+3}+\\frac{y}{x+3} \\leqslant \\frac{3}{32}x^2+\\frac{3}{32}y^2+\\frac{5}{16} \\quad \\forall x,y \\in [0,2].$ Consider the substitution: $x = X+1,\\; y = Y+1.$ Then $X,Y \\in [-1, 1]$ and this inequality turns into: $$\\frac{X+1}{Y+4}+\\frac{Y+1}{X+4} \\leqslant \\frac{3}{32}(X+1)^2+\\frac{3}{32}(Y+1)^2+\\frac{5}{16}$$\n$$\\Longleftrightarrow 3X^3Y + 3XY^3 + 18X^2Y + 18XY^2 +12X^3 + 12Y^3\\\\ + 40X^2 + 40Y^2 + 64XY \\geqslant 0.$$ If $XY\\geqslant0$: $$3XY(X^2 + Y^2) + 18XY(X + Y) + 12(X^3 + Y^3) + 40(X^2 + Y^2) + 64XY\n= 9(X^2+Y^2)(X+1)(Y+1) + 3(X+Y+2)(X+Y)^2 + 20(X+Y)^2\\\\ + 5(X^2+Y^2) + 6XY(2-X-Y) \\geqslant 0.$$ If $XY<0$ assuming WLOG that $X\\in(0,1],\\ Z=-Y\\in(0,1]$ (thanks to this answer ): $$-3XZ(X^2 + Z^2) - 18XZ(X - Z) + 12(X^3 - Z^3) + 40(X^2 + Z^2) - 64XZ \\geqslant 0\\\\\n18XZ^2 + 12X^3 + 40(X^2 + Z^2) \\geqslant 3XZ(X^2 + Z^2) + 18X^2Z + 12Z^3 + 64XZ,$$ which follows from $$\\begin{split}\n12Z^2 \\geqslant& 12Z^3\\\\\n40X^2+28Z^2 \\geqslant& 2\\sqrt{40\\cdot28}XZ \\geqslant 64XZ\\\\\n9XZ^2+9X^3 \\geqslant& 18X^2Z\\\\\n3X^3 \\geqslant& 3X^3Z\\\\\n3XZ^2 \\geqslant& 3XZ^3\\\\\n6XZ^2 \\geqslant& 0.\n\\end{split}$$ This ends the proof.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the problem into Assumptions and Problem sections based on the example given. Let me read through the original question carefully.\n\nThe original problem is to prove that (a/(b+3) + b/(c+3) + c/(d+3) + d/(a+3)) ≤ 1 given that a, b, c, d are non-negative and a² + b² + c² + d² = 4.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The problem states that a, b, c, d are non-negative real numbers. Each variable is ≥0, so each should be listed as a separate assumption. Also, the condition a² + b² + c² + d² =4 is another assumption. The problem is to show the inequality.\n\nWait, in the example provided, the assumptions were split into each property applied to one object. For instance, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" were separate lines. So here, each variable being non-negative should each be a separate assumption. But the user example split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7. Wait, actually, looking back, in the example, the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7. The formatted problem included \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, but that was a mistake. Wait, no, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91. The user formatted it as:\n\nAssumption: \n- n is an integer,\n- n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut wait, that seems incorrect. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should be that n is an integer, and then the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. However, the example added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which might not be correct. But perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. Wait, maybe the original problem in the example actually had the divisibility by 7? Let me check:\n\nOriginal problem example: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that's conflicting. If the problem states \"for every integer n\", then the assumption shouldn't include that n is divisible by 7. Unless the problem was mistyped. Hmm. Maybe the example given was wrong, but the user wants to follow that format. So in the example, the user added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which might not be part of the original problem's conditions, but maybe the problem was mistyped. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem had an additional condition. However, given that the user's example is as such, perhaps in their formatting, they split each condition into separate lines, even if the original problem didn't state it. Wait, but in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should just be \"n is an integer\". But the formatted problem in the example has \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That's incorrect. So maybe there's a mistake in the example, but the user still wants to follow that structure. Wait, perhaps the user intended to have the assumptions as all given conditions. But in the example, the problem is to prove divisibility by 91 (which is 7*13). If the problem is to prove for every integer n, then 7 and 13 must divide the expression for any n. However, if n must be divisible by both 7 and 13, then the problem would make sense, but the original problem didn't state that. So perhaps the example has an error. But since the user provided that example, perhaps they want me to follow it even if it's incorrect. Therefore, when structuring the current problem, I need to list all the given conditions as separate assumptions.\n\nBack to the current problem. The original question states: Let a,b,c,d ≥0, such that a² + b² + c² + d² =4. Show that the sum of fractions is ≤1. So the assumptions are:\n\n- a, b, c, d are non-negative (each variable ≥0)\n- a² + b² + c² + d² =4\n\nBut following the example's structure, each assumption is line by line, each addressing only one property or condition applied to one object. So \"a, b, c, d are non-negative\" can be split into four separate assumptions:\n\n- a ≥0\n- b ≥0\n- c ≥0\n- d ≥0\n- a² + b² + c² + d² =4\n\nBut wait, in the example, the user listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. So if the original problem has four variables each non-negative, each should be a separate line. Then the problem statement is the inequality.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- a ≥ 0\n- b ≥ 0\n- c ≥ 0\n- d ≥ 0\n- a² + b² + c² + d² = 4\n\nProblem: Prove that (a/(b+3) + b/(c+3) + c/(d+3) + d/(a+3) ≤1.\n\nThat's the correct structure. Let me double-check the original question. The user's problem states \"Let a,b,c,d≥0, such that a² + b² + c² + d² =4\", so those are the conditions. Therefore, the assumptions should be each variable non-negative and the sum of squares equals 4.",
