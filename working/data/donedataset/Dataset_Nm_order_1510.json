    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $ \\displaystyle I(a) =  \\int_{0}^{\\pi /2} \\ln(1+ a \\sin^{2}x) \\, dx$. Then differentiating under the integral sign, $$I'(a) = \\int_{0}^{\\pi /2} \\frac{\\sin^{2} x}{1+a \\sin^{2} x} \\, dx = \\int_{0}^{\\pi /2} \\frac{1}{a+ \\csc^{2} x} \\, dx .$$ Now let $u = \\cot x$. Then $$ \\begin{align} I'(a) &= \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{a+1+u^{2}} \\frac{1}{1+u^{2}} \\, du \\\\ &= \\frac{1}{a} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{1}{1+u^{2}} - \\frac{1}{1+a+u^{2}} \\right) \\, du \\\\ &= \\frac{1}{a} \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{1}{1+a} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{u^{2}}{1+a}} \\, du \\right)  \\\\ &=\\frac{1}{a} \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+a}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+v^{2}} \\, dv \\right)  \\\\  &= \\frac{\\pi}{2a} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+a}} \\right). \\end{align}$$ Then integrating back, $$ \\begin{align} I(a) &= \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\int \\frac{1}{a} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+a}} \\right) \\, da \\\\ &= \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\int \\frac{1}{u^{2}-1} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{u} \\right) 2u \\, du \\\\ &= \\pi \\int \\frac{1}{1+u} \\, du \\\\ &= \\pi \\ln \\left(1+ \\sqrt{1+a} \\right) + C. \\end{align}$$ And since $I(0) = 0$, $C = -\\pi \\ln 2$. Therefore, $$I(a) = \\pi \\ln \\left(\\frac{1 +\\sqrt{1+a}}{2} \\right) .$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the problem from Math Stack Exchange. The example provided shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object, and then the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the original question, the integral given is I₁ = ∫₀^{π/2} ln(1 + α sin²x) dx, which is supposed to equal π ln[(1 + √(1 + α))/2] for α ≥ -1. The user is asking for a proof of this result.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The integral has limits from 0 to π/2. The integrand is ln(1 + α sin²x). The parameter α has a condition: α ≥ -1. These are the key elements.\n\nSo the assumptions should be:\n\n1. The integral is evaluated from 0 to π/2.\n2. The integrand is ln(1 + α sin²x).\n3. The parameter α satisfies α ≥ -1.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The problem is to prove that this integral equals π times the natural logarithm of (1 + sqrt(1 + α))/2.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user also mentions splitting the integral into ln α term and another integral I₂. However, for formatting the problem, we need to filter out the user's attempts and focus on the original problem statement. The user's own steps (like splitting the integral and defining I₂) are part of their attempt, not the problem's assumptions. So we should ignore those when listing the assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the correct assumptions are:\n\n- The integral is from 0 to π/2.\n- The integrand is ln(1 + α sin²x).\n- α is greater than or equal to -1.\n\nThe problem is to prove that this integral equals π multiplied by the natural logarithm of (1 + sqrt(1 + α))/2.\n\nI need to check if there's any other implicit assumption. For example, maybe the function is integrable under these conditions, but since α ≥ -1 ensures that 1 + α sin²x is non-negative (since sin²x is between 0 and 1, so if α is -1, 1 - sin²x ≥ 0 because sin²x ≤ 1), that's covered by the given condition. So the assumptions are correctly captured.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have those three assumptions and the problem statement as proving the integral equals the given expression.",
