    "Content": "Given an $n\\times n$ upper triangular matrix $A$ with zero on main diagonal, show that $A^n = 0$. I did some matrix operation and noticed that the diagonal moves up, ultimately all entries will be zero. Is there a nicer way to do it?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If $\\mathbf{e}_1,\\ldots,\\mathbf{e}_n$ is the standard basis for $\\mathbb{R}^n$ (or whatever your base field is), then notice that $A\\mathbf{e}_1=\\mathbf{0}$, and\n$$A\\mathbf{e}_i \\in \\mathrm{span}(\\mathbf{e}_1,\\ldots,\\mathbf{e}_{i-1}),\\quad i=2,3,\\ldots,n.$$ Now show that $A^n\\mathbf{e}_i = \\mathbf{0}$ for all $i$ to get the desired conclusion.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to structure the Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe original question is about proving that an n×n upper triangular matrix with zeros on the main diagonal is nilpotent, specifically that A^n = 0. The user mentioned doing matrix operations and noticing the diagonal moving up, but they're asking for a nicer method.\n\nNow, following the example provided, the assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. The matrix A is n×n, upper triangular, and has zeros on the main diagonal. Each of these is a separate assumption. The problem is to show that A^n equals the zero matrix.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the main conditions are on the matrix A. The problem doesn't specify any conditions on n other than it being the size of the matrix. So the assumptions should be about A: being n×n, upper triangular, and main diagonal zeros. Each of these is a single condition on A. Then the problem is to prove A^n = 0.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is a single line addressing one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\nA is an n×n matrix,\nA is upper triangular,\nAll entries on the main diagonal of A are zero.\n\nProblem:\nShow that A^n = 0.\n\nThat should cover it. The user's example had two assumptions for n, but here the assumptions are about A. The key points are the matrix's size, structure (upper triangular), and main diagonal zeros. The problem is to show its nth power is zero. That seems correct. I don't see any other hidden assumptions. The user might have thought about eigenvalues or Jordan forms, but the standard proof uses the structure of upper triangular matrices with zero diagonal, so these assumptions are sufficient.",
