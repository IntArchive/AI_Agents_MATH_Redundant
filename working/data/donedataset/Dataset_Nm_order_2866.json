    "Content": "I have the following question: Show that a symmetric bilinear form is nondegenerate if and only if its matrix in a basis is invertible Ok so both directions \"if non-degenerate then the matrix is invertible\" and \"if matrix is invertible then the form is nondegenerate\" have to be proven for this. For the first direction. If the bilinear form is non-degenerate its null space is $\\left\\{0\\right\\}$, so for every $v \\neq 0$ there exists a $v'$ such that $\\langle v, v' \\rangle \\neq 0$ and so there are no zero eigenvalues, I'm pretty sure this somehow implies the determinant of the matrix is also non-zero, as it is the product of the eigenvalues and hence invertible (but not sure how to show this). For the other direction, if the matrix is invertible, then the determinant is non-zero and, if my previous assumption is correct, this implies there are no zero eigenvectors, which implies the null space is $\\left\\{0\\right\\}$ and hence non-degenerate? Thanks for any guidance, the notes I have on this topic are pretty poor so I'm having a hard time fully understanding everything. Thanks again.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let me assume that you have a bilinear form $q : V \\times V \\to F$, where $V$ is a finite-dimensional vector space over the field $F$. Fix a basis $\\beta = \\{e_1,\\dotsc,e_n\\}$ of $V$, which defines the corresponding dual basis $\\beta^\\ast = \\{e_1^\\ast,\\dotsc,e_n^\\ast\\}$ of $V^\\ast$. First, check that $q$ defines a linear transformation $Q : V \\to V^\\ast$ by $Q(v) := q(v,\\cdot)$ satisfying $\\ker Q = \\ker q$. Now, since for any $\\phi \\in V^\\ast$, $\\phi = \\sum_k \\phi(e_k) e_k^\\ast$,\n$$\nQ(e_k) = \\sum_j Q(e_k)(e_j) e_j^\\ast = \\sum_j q(e_k,e_j) e_j^\\ast = \\sum_j q(e_j,e_k)e_j^\\ast\n$$\nfor each $k$, and hence the matrix $[Q]_{\\beta^\\ast\\beta}$ of $Q$ with respect to the bases $\\beta$ and $\\beta^\\ast$ is precisely the matrix $[q]_\\beta$ of $q$ with respect to $\\beta$. As a result, your matrix of interest $[q]_\\beta$ is invertible if and only if the linear transformation $Q$ is invertible. So, let's collect what we know: $[q]_\\beta = [Q]_{\\beta^\\ast\\beta}$, so that $[q]_\\beta$ is invertible if and only if $Q$ is invertible. $\\ker q = \\ker Q$, so that $q$ is non-degenerate if and only if $Q$ is injective. $\\dim V = \\dim V^\\ast$, so that by the rank-nullity theorem, $Q : V \\to V^\\ast$ is injective if and only if it is surjective. What can you therefore conclude?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that I need to list each assumption line by line, addressing one property or condition per line applied to one object. Then, state the problem concisely.\n\nThe original question is about showing that a symmetric bilinear form is nondegenerate if and only if its matrix in a basis is invertible. The user is asking for both directions of the proof. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the original problem. The key elements here are:\n\n1. The bilinear form is symmetric.\n2. The form is nondegenerate (for one direction).\n3. The matrix of the form in a basis is invertible (for the other direction).\n\nThe problem is to prove the equivalence: nondegenerate ⇨ invertible matrix and invertible matrix ⇨ nondegenerate. \n\nNow, to structure this into the format. The assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. The problem statement is to show the equivalence.\n\nIn the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions would likely be the properties of the bilinear form and the matrix. Since the problem is about an \"if and only if\" statement, each direction has its own condition. But the format requires listing all assumptions first. However, the problem statement itself is the equivalence. \n\nWait, the user's example included assumptions that might not all be in the original problem. The original problem in the example had to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no, looking back: the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem listed assumptions as n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like a mistake. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the user made an error in their example? Because the original problem is for every integer n, but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which actually changes the problem. Maybe that's a mistake, but the user provided that example, so I have to follow their format even if it's incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the example is not perfect, but the user wants me to follow their structure. So, in their example, they extracted assumptions from the problem. The original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption is \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" But that seems contradictory because the original problem states \"for every integer n,\" so the assumption should just be that n is an integer. However, the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. That's confusing. Maybe the example is incorrect, but I have to follow the user's instruction regardless.\n\nBut perhaps in the example, the user intended to modify the original problem. Wait, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem's assumption is \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7,\" and the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. But 91 is 7×13, so maybe they intended to show that under n being divisible by 7, it's divisible by 13, or vice versa? Hmm, not sure, but regardless, the user's example shows that assumptions are listed line by line, each with one condition applied to one object.\n\nSo returning to the current problem. The original question is to show that a symmetric bilinear form is nondegenerate iff its matrix in a basis is invertible. The user mentions both directions. So the key assumptions here are:\n\n1. The bilinear form is symmetric.\n2. The bilinear form is nondegenerate (for one direction).\n3. The matrix of the bilinear form in a basis is invertible (for the other direction).\n\nBut since it's an \"if and only if,\" the problem is to show two implications. However, in the formatted problem, the assumptions should list all conditions given in the problem. The problem statement is to prove the equivalence. \n\nWait, perhaps the assumptions are the properties given in the problem. The problem states that the bilinear form is symmetric. So the main assumptions are that the bilinear form is symmetric and that we are working in a basis. But the problem doesn't mention any specific basis, so perhaps the assumption is that there exists a basis in which the matrix is considered. But in linear algebra, when you talk about the matrix of a bilinear form, it's always with respect to some basis. So maybe the key assumption here is that the bilinear form is symmetric. Then, the problem is to show that for such a form, being nondegenerate is equivalent to its matrix (in any basis) being invertible.\n\nWait, but the invertibility of the matrix depends on the basis. However, for a bilinear form, if it's nondegenerate in one basis, then its matrix in that basis is invertible, and if the matrix is invertible in some basis, then the form is nondegenerate. But since the problem states \"its matrix in a basis,\" perhaps the basis is fixed. So the problem is: given a symmetric bilinear form, show that it is nondegenerate if and only if its matrix in some (given) basis is invertible.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The bilinear form is symmetric.\n- There exists a basis in which the matrix of the bilinear form is considered.\n\nBut the problem as stated in the original question is: Show that a symmetric bilinear form is nondegenerate if and only if its matrix in a basis is invertible. So the problem is about symmetric bilinear forms, and the equivalence between non-degeneracy and invertibility of the matrix in a basis.\n\nThus, the key assumption is that the bilinear form is symmetric. The problem is to prove the equivalence.\n\nBut the example given by the user had multiple assumptions, even though the original problem might not state them. For instance, in the example, the original problem was for all integers n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be incorrect, but perhaps the user wants to extract implicit assumptions. But in this case, the problem is about symmetric bilinear forms, so the main assumption is that the form is symmetric. The other part is that we are considering the matrix in a basis, which is a general setup.\n\nTherefore, structuring this:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The bilinear form is symmetric.\n- The matrix of the bilinear form is considered in a basis.\n\nProblem: Show that the symmetric bilinear form is nondegenerate if and only if its matrix in a basis is invertible.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement in the original question is \"Show that a symmetric bilinear form is nondegenerate if and only if its matrix in a basis is invertible.\" So the key elements are:\n\n1. The bilinear form is symmetric.\n2. The form is nondegenerate (for the first direction).\n3. The matrix in a basis is invertible (for the other direction).\n\nBut the problem is to show the equivalence between these two properties. Therefore, the assumptions should list the given conditions. Since the problem is about any symmetric bilinear form, the main assumption is that the form is symmetric. The rest is what needs to be proven.\n\nBut in the user's example, they listed assumptions from the problem. The original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions were \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, that seems like they changed the problem. The original problem's conclusion is that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. That seems incorrect. Maybe the user made a mistake in their example, but I have to follow their format regardless.\n\nBut given that, perhaps in this case, the assumptions are:\n\n- The bilinear form is symmetric.\n\nBecause the problem is about symmetric bilinear forms. Then, the problem is to show the equivalence between non-degeneracy and invertibility of the matrix in a basis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem doesn't require any additional assumptions beyond what's stated. The problem is to show an equivalence, so the assumptions are the properties given in the problem statement. Since the problem is about symmetric bilinear forms, the main assumption is the symmetry. Then, the problem is to show the equivalence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has two parts, each with their own assumptions. For the \"if\" direction, the assumption is that the matrix is invertible, and the conclusion is non-degeneracy. For the \"only if\" direction, the assumption is non-degeneracy, and the conclusion is matrix invertible. But the user's format wants all assumptions listed upfront.\n\nGiven the example, where the original problem was about all integers n, but the formatted problem listed n being an integer and divisible by 7 as assumptions, which actually restricts the problem. That suggests that perhaps the user wants to extract all conditions from the problem, even if they are part of the universal quantifier. But in the current problem, the user's problem is an equivalence, so each direction has its own hypothesis.\n\nBut according to the user's example, they extracted assumptions from the original problem. The original problem said \"for every integer n\", so they listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, and then added \"n is divisible by 7\" which was not in the original problem. That seems like a mistake, but perhaps the example was incorrect. Therefore, in the current problem, the original question is to show the equivalence for symmetric bilinear forms, so the main assumption is that the bilinear form is symmetric. The problem is to prove the equivalence.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The bilinear form is symmetric.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the symmetric bilinear form is nondegenerate if and only if its matrix in a basis is invertible.\n\nBut the original question also mentions \"in a basis\". So perhaps another assumption is that we have a fixed basis. But in linear algebra, when you talk about the matrix of a bilinear form, it's always with respect to a basis. However, the invertibility of the matrix is basis-dependent. But non-degeneracy is a basis-independent property. So the equivalence is that for a symmetric bilinear form, being non-degenerate is equivalent to its matrix representation in any basis being invertible. Wait, actually, if the matrix is invertible in one basis, then it's invertible in all bases, because the matrices in different bases are congruent, and congruent matrices have the same rank. Since invertibility is equivalent to full rank, if the matrix is invertible in one basis, it's invertible in all bases. Therefore, the problem is correctly stated.\n\nTherefore, the key assumption is the symmetry of the bilinear form. Hence, the formatted problem should list that as the assumption.\n\nBut according to the user's example, even if the original problem didn't state an assumption, they added it. For example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. That seems like an error, but perhaps the user intended to show that even if the problem is stated for all n, they wanted to structure it with assumptions. But perhaps in reality, the original example was different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example was about a problem where divisibility by 91 is equivalent to divisibility by 7 and 13, and the user wanted to assume n is divisible by 7 to simplify the problem. But this is unclear.\n\nRegardless, for the current problem, the main assumption given in the problem is that the bilinear form is symmetric. The problem is to show the equivalence between non-degeneracy and invertibility of the matrix in a basis. Therefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The bilinear form is symmetric.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the symmetric bilinear form is nondegenerate if and only if its matrix in a basis is invertible.\n\nBut the original question's title is \"Non-degenerate bilinear forms and invertible matrices\", and the problem statement is to show the equivalence for symmetric bilinear forms. So yes, the key assumption is the symmetry.\n\nI think that's the correct structure here.",
