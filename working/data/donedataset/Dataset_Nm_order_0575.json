    "Content": "The function $f(x)=x+\\sin(x)$ is easily checked to be a bijection from the reals to itself, and so it has a unique inverse $y\\mapsto g(y)$ such that $f\\circ g=g\\circ f$ are both the identity map. Now $g$ will almost certainly be a function which is not expressible using \"the functions in a high-schooler's toolkit\" (by which I guess I mean $\\exp$, $\\log$, and, if you like, the usual trigonometric functions and their friends like $\\sinh$, although of course these can all be of course built from exponentials anyway). For purely recreational reasons (stemming from conversations I've had whilst teaching undergraduates) I'm interested in how one proves this sort of thing. A few years ago I was interested in a related question, and took the trouble to learn some differential Galois theory. My motivation at the time was learning how to prove things like why $h(t):=\\int_0^t e^{x^2} dx$ is not expressible in terms of these calculator-button functions (I'm sure there's a better name for them but I'm afraid I don't know it). I've realised that since then I've forgotten most of what I knew, but furthermore I am also unclear about whether this is the way one is supposed to proceed. Is the idea that I come up with some linear differential equation satisfied by $g$ and then apply some differential Galois theory technique? In fact, one of the many things that I have forgotten is the following: if $F$ is a field equipped with a differential operator $D$, and $E/F$ is the field extension obtained by adding a non-zero root of $Dh=ch$, with $c\\in F$, then the Galois group of $E/F$ is solvable, whereas the equation itself might not be, in terms of calculator-button functions, if I can't integrate $c$. Can a more enlightened soul explain to me how one is supposed to proceed? I wonder whether I am somehow conflating two ideas and the differential Galois theory business is a red herring, but it seemed simpler to ask rather than continuing to flounder around.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I have finally found an answer to my own question, so I'll answer it myself and make the answer community wiki so I don't profit from it. Let me first explain why the other answers given here did not completely resolve the problem. Let me use standard notation -- an elementary function is a funtion you can build using the buttons on your calculator. If you allow complex coefficients then basically you only need exp and log, as you can build everything else from this. Ragib Zaman's answer points us to a paper of Ritt where he proves a theorem of the form \"an elementary function whose inverse is also an elementary function must be of a very special form\", but this very special form is quite hard to work with: it is basically of the form exp(rational function(log(rational function(log(rational function(exp(...))))))) where at each stage you can choose whether to use exp or log. The problem with this is that it's very hard (for me) to prove that the function $x+\\sin(x)$ can provably not be expressed in this form. Ritt's work relies on ideas of Liouville, and Liouville had a lot of ideas about this sort of question. Liouville proved a criterion for when an elementary function had an elementary integral (in fact he proved several results of this form, best phrased nowadays in the language of differential fields). One can hence use calculus as a tool: one can use strategies such as \"the inverse function of this function satisfies a certain differential equation, which implies it can't be elementary\". But here you have to be skillful to actually get your equation into the right form. This is why I can't use Nicholas' answer to answer my question. Nicholas observes that Lambert's $W$ function isn't elementary, and I know a proof of this which uses calculus and Liouville's criterion -- the trick being to write down a differential equation which (a simple function of) $W$ satisfies and then using Liouville to prove that this differential equation has no elementary solutions -- but the moment you change the problem a little, the differential equation changes, and the methods may not (and in this case don't) apply. An analogue might be this: if I can integrate $1/\\sqrt{1-x^2}$, then even though it looks quite similar, I might well not be able to integrate $1/\\sqrt{1-x^2+x^{-2}}$. This is an area where even quite a small change might derail things substantially. On the other hand, these answers helped me immensely, because they provided me with references which enabled me to start a literature search. And today the search came to an end, because I got my hands on a copy of \"Integration in finite terms: Liouville's theory of elementary methods\" by J. F. Ritt (written in 1948), and on p56 Ritt shows how to deal with $x+\\sin(x)$ explicitly! Apparently the equation $y=x+a\\sin(x)$ ($a$ a constant) is called \"Kepler's equation\". So the answer to the question is \"this has nothing really to do with differential Galois theory; you need Liouville's theory, and a proof is in p56 of Ritt's 1948 book mentioned above\".",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so the user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me start by reading through the problem carefully.\n\nThe original question is about why the inverse of the function f(x) = x + sin(x) isn't expressible using common calculator functions like exp, log, trigonometric functions, etc. The user mentions differential Galois theory and relates it to proving non-expressibility of functions in terms of elementary functions.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. The assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object.\n\nLooking at the problem, the key points are:\n1. The function f(x) = x + sin(x) is a bijection from the reals to itself.\n2. Therefore, it has a unique inverse function g(y).\n3. The question is about proving that g(y) cannot be expressed using elementary functions (those found on a calculator, like exp, log, sin, etc.).\n4. The user is also asking whether differential Galois theory is the right approach here, similar to proving that certain integrals aren't elementary.\n\nSo, the assumptions would include the properties of f(x) being a bijection and having a unique inverse. The problem is to show that this inverse isn't expressible with the standard functions.\n\nWait, but the example given in the user's prompt had assumptions like n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Each assumption is a single condition on one object. Here, the function f is a bijection (one assumption), it has a unique inverse (another assumption?), but maybe the bijection implies the inverse exists, so maybe that's part of the problem statement rather than an assumption. Hmm.\n\nWait, the problem states that f is a bijection, so that's a given fact (assumption). The inverse exists uniquely as a consequence. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- f(x) = x + sin(x) is a bijection from ℝ to ℝ.\n- f has a unique inverse function g(y).\n\nBut perhaps the first assumption is sufficient because the existence of the inverse follows from being a bijection. However, the problem mentions that the inverse is unique, so maybe that's part of the problem's given information.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"The function f(x)=x+sin(x) is easily checked to be a bijection from the reals to itself, and so it has a unique inverse y↦g(y) such that f∘g=g∘f are both the identity map.\" So in the formatted problem, the assumptions would be that f is a bijection (hence invertible), and the inverse g exists uniquely. But since the existence and uniqueness of the inverse is a consequence of f being a bijection, maybe the only assumption needed is that f is a bijection. However, the problem is to prove that the inverse isn't expressible in terms of elementary functions. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- f(x) = x + sin(x) is a bijection from ℝ to ℝ.\n- The inverse function g(y) exists and is unique.\n\nBut maybe even that is redundant, since the problem is to prove that g can't be expressed in elementary functions. So perhaps the key assumption is that f is defined as x + sin(x), which is a bijection. But the problem itself is about the inverse of this specific function.\n\nWait, the example given in the user's prompt had assumptions like n is an integer and n divisible by 7, but in the original problem, the user mentioned that the divisibility by 7 might have been part of the problem, but in the formatted version, it was listed as an assumption. So perhaps in this case, the assumption is just that f is a bijection (as given in the problem statement), and the problem is to prove that its inverse isn't expressible with elementary functions.\n\nBut the problem as stated by the user on Math Stack Exchange is asking how to prove that the inverse function isn't expressible using those functions. So the formatted problem should have the assumptions that f is a bijection (so the inverse exists), and the problem is to show the inverse isn't elementary.\n\nBut maybe the key assumption here is the definition of f, which is f(x) = x + sin(x). So:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) = x + sin(x) is a bijection from ℝ to ℝ.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the inverse function g(y) of f is not expressible in terms of elementary functions (exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric, etc.).\n\nBut wait, the original problem also mentions that the user is interested in whether differential Galois theory is the right approach, but in the formatting, we need to present the problem concisely. The main task is to structure the problem, so the problem part should be the question to be answered, which is proving the inverse isn't expressible in elementary terms.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) = x + sin(x) is a bijection from ℝ to ℝ.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the inverse function g(y) of f is not expressible in terms of elementary functions.\n\nBut maybe the assumption should include that f has an inverse, but since the problem states that f is a bijection, which implies the inverse exists. So perhaps that's sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is more about the method of proof using differential Galois theory, but the user is structuring the problem part as the actual mathematical question. The original question is \"Why isn't the inverse expressible...\", so the problem is to show why the inverse can't be expressed with those functions.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) = x + sin(x) is a bijection from ℝ to ℝ.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the inverse function g(y) of f cannot be expressed using elementary functions (exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric functions, etc.).\n\nYes, that seems to capture it. The user's example had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, but here, the key assumption is that f is a bijection (given by its definition). So I think that's correct.",
