    "Content": "Theorem: Let $f$ be continuous on $[a,\\,b]$ and assume $f(a)<f(b)$. Then for every $k$ such that $f(a)<k<f(b)$, there exists a $c\\in[a,\\,b]$ such that $f(c)=k$. proof: $f$ continuous at $a\\implies$ for $\\varepsilon=k-f(a)>0$, $\\exists\\delta>0$ s.t. $$|f(x)-f(a)|<\\varepsilon=k-f(a)\\quad\\forall x\\colon |x-a|<\\delta.$$ Consider the set $H=\\{x\\in[a,\\,b]\\colon f(x)<k\\}\\not=\\emptyset \\implies c=\\sup{(H)}$. Show $f(c)=k$, suppose $f(c)<k\\iff k-f(c)>0$. We know $f$ is continuous at $c$ so $\\forall\\varepsilon>k-f(c)>0$ $\\exists\\delta>0:|f(x)-f(c)|<\\varepsilon=k-f(c)$ when $|x-c|<\\delta$. $\\implies f(x)-f(c)<k-f(c)$. Say $x=c+\\delta/2\\implies f(x)<k\\implies c+\\delta/2\\in H$ which contradicts the fact $c=\\sup{(H)}$, since $\\delta>0$. Same proof works if $f(c)>k$, thus $f(c)=k$. This is a proof for the intermediate value theorem given by my lecturer, I was wondering if someone could explain a few things: What is the set $H$, what does it define? Why does contradicting the fact that $c=\\sup{(H)}$ prove that $f(c)\\not<k$? How would I continue to actually finish this proof, ie. show $f(c)\\not>k$?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The set $H$ is the set of elements $x\\in [a,b]$ for which $f(x)<k$. Since this set is bounded, it has a supremum $c\\in[a,b]$. There are three cases: $f(c)=k$ $f(c)<k$ $f(c)>k$ In the first case, you're done. Suppose $f(c)<k$. In particular $c\\in H$ and, moreover $a<c<b$, because by assumption, $f(a)<k$ and $f(b)>k$. By continuity of $f$ at $c$, there is $\\delta>0$ such that $a<c-\\delta<c+\\delta<b$ and\n$$\n|x-c|<\\delta \\implies f(x)<k\n$$\n(by considering the continuous function $k-f(x)$ which is positive at $c$). But then $c+\\delta/2\\in H$, because $f(c+\\delta/2)<k$. A contradiction to the fact that $c=\\sup H$. Suppose $f(c)>k$. By the same argument as before, there exists $\\delta>0$ such that $a<c-\\delta<c+\\delta<b$ and\n$$\n|x-c|<\\delta \\implies f(x)>k\n$$\nBut, by definition of supremum, there is $x\\in H$ such that $c-x<\\delta$; for this $x$ we have both $f(x)<k$ and $f(x)>k$, a contradiction.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about understanding a proof of the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT) provided by the lecturer. The student has specific questions about the set H, the contradiction step, and how to conclude the proof by showing f(c) is not greater than k.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions from the problem. The IVT states that if a function f is continuous on [a, b], and there's a k between f(a) and f(b), then there exists some c in [a, b] such that f(c) = k. The proof provided uses the set H and supremum c.\n\nLooking at the theorem's conditions:\n1. f is continuous on [a, b].\n2. f(a) < f(b) (though the IVT usually just requires f(a) ≠ f(b), but here the specific case is given where f(a) < f(b) and k is between them).\n3. k is such that f(a) < k < f(b).\n\nIn the proof, they define H as {x ∈ [a, b] | f(x) < k}. The student is confused about what H represents. Then, by taking c as sup(H), they show that assuming f(c) < k leads to a contradiction because c + δ/2 would be in H, which contradicts c being the supremum. Similarly, they mention that if f(c) > k, another contradiction arises, hence f(c) must equal k.\n\nSo, the assumptions for the problem (theorem) should include the continuity on the interval, the inequality between f(a) and f(b), and the value k lying strictly between them. Each assumption should be a single line addressing one property applied to one object. The problem is to prove that under these conditions, there exists a c in [a, b] where f(c) = k.\n\nThe user's example structured the assumptions line by line, each about one object. So here, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. f is continuous on [a, b].\n2. f(a) < f(b).\n3. k is a real number such that f(a) < k < f(b).\n\nThe problem statement is to prove there exists a c in [a, b] such that f(c) = k. The student's specific questions about H and the contradiction are part of understanding the proof, but the structured problem as per the format is just the theorem statement with the assumptions listed.\n\nSo, putting it all together following the format:\n\nAssumption: f is continuous on [a, b].\nAssumption: f(a) < f(b).\nAssumption: k is a real number satisfying f(a) < k < f(b).\nProblem: Prove that there exists a point c ∈ [a, b] such that f(c) = k.\n\nI need to check if there are any other implicit assumptions. The problem mentions the set H and the contradiction, but those are part of the proof steps, not the theorem's assumptions. The theorem's assumptions are just the continuity, the interval, and the value k between f(a) and f(b). The original problem statement in the question includes all these, so that's covered.",
