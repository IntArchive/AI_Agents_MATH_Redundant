    "Content": "I did some numeric experiments with integrals involving double logarithms (because they received much interest both on this site and in published papers, sometimes under names of Malmsten—Vardi—Adamchik integrals).

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. The original problem is an integral involving logarithms and the Glaisher-Kinkelin constant. Let me first parse the question to extract the necessary components.\n\nFirst, the title of the question is the integral expression, and the body provides more details. The user mentions numeric experiments and states the conjectured equality. The integral is from 0 to 1 of ln(ln((1+x)/(1-x))) multiplied by (ln x)/(1 - x²) dx, which is conjectured to equal (π²/24) times ln(A³⁶/(16π³)), where A is the Glaisher-Kinkelin constant defined as exp(1/12 - ζ'(-1)).\n\nNow, I need to structure this according to the example given. The assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. Let's see: the integral is definite from 0 to 1, the integrand involves logarithms and a rational function, and A is defined as exp(1/12 - ζ'(-1)). The problem is to prove the equality.\n\nWait, the original example had assumptions like n is an integer, n divisible by 7. Here, the problem doesn't state any explicit conditions except the integral limits and the definition of A. So the assumptions would be the integral bounds, the definition of A, and perhaps the functions involved? But the example's assumptions were more about the variables and their properties. Since the integral is definite from 0 to 1, that's an assumption about the limits. The integrand's form is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. The definition of A is given, so that's an assumption about A. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated from 0 to 1,\nA is defined as exp(1/12 - ζ'(-1)).\n\nBut wait, in the example, the assumptions were about the variable n. Here, the integral's variable is x, but it's integrated out. The problem is to prove the equality. So maybe the main assumptions are the limits of integration and the definition of A. I should list those as separate assumptions.\n\nProblem: Prove the conjectured equality of the integral to the expression involving π², A, etc.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is taken over the interval [0, 1],\nA is the Glaisher-Kinkelin constant defined as A = exp(1/12 - ζ'(-1)).\n\nProblem: Prove that\n$${\\large\\int}_0^1\\ln\\ln\\left(\\frac{1+x}{1-x}\\right)\\cdot\\frac{\\ln x}{1-x^2}\\,dx = \\frac{\\pi^2}{24}\\,\\ln\\left(\\frac{A^{36}}{16\\,\\pi^3}\\right).$$\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property. Here, the integral bounds are one assumption, and the definition of A is another. So each on a separate line. Also, the problem statement should include the equality as given. The original problem had a question mark over the equality, but in the formatted example, the problem was stated without the question mark, as \"Prove that... is divisible by 91.\" So here, the problem should be to prove the equality, so the question mark is removed. The user's example didn't include the question mark in the formatted problem. So I need to structure it accordingly.",
