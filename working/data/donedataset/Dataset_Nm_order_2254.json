    "Content": "I have been doing a basic math course on Real analysis...I encountered with a problem which follows as \" Prove that $na \\pmod1$ is dense in $(0,1)$..where $a$ is an Irrational number , $n\\ge1$... I tried to prove it using only basic principles...first of all I proved that above defined sequence is infinite..and also it is bounded...so by Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem it has a limit point in $(0,1)$..but to prove denseness I need to prove that for any given $(a,b)$ a subset of $(0,1)$ there is at least one element of the sequence...I am not getting how to figure out and link that limit point to that interval $(a,b)$..can any one help me in this..?...It would be of great help...",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "It is better than dense, it is equidistributed (in $\\mathbb{R}/\\mathbb{Z}$), meaning that if $f: \\mathbb{R}/\\mathbb{Z} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}$ is continuous (it is equivalent to give $f$ or a $1$-periodic continuous function from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{C}$), $\\lim_{n \\rightarrow + \\infty} \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{k=1}^n f(kx)= \\int_0^1 f$. This can be easily proven using the fact that the polynomials in $t \\mapsto e^{2 i \\pi t}$ and $t \\mapsto e^{2 i \\pi t}$ (so, sums of the form $\\sum_{l=-n}^n \\lambda_k e^{2 i \\pi l t}$) are dense (for the supremum norm) in our space of $1$-periodic continuous functions (Weierstrass theorem), and it is easy to compute $\\lim_{n \\rightarrow + \\infty} \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{k=1}^n e^{2 i \\pi l k x} = \\delta_{l,0}$. The density of your sequence follows: if an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}/\\mathbb{Z}$ (or $]0,1[$) did not contain any element of the sequence, using a \"test function\" $f$, non-negative, not identically zero and whose support is contained in our given open subset, would contradict the equidistribution. EDIT: if you don't you the density theorem of Weierstrass above, you could also use the fact that $x \\mathbb{Z} + \\mathbb{Z}$ is dense in $\\mathbb{R}$ (since it has no smallest positive element, otherwise $x$ would be rational), but this way you only get density, not equidistribution.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is asking about proving that the sequence (nx - floor(nx)) is dense in [0,1], where a is an irrational number and n ≥ 1. The original problem statement mentions \"na mod 1\", which translates to nx - floor(nx) because mod 1 gives the fractional part.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The key points here are that a is irrational, n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and the sequence in question is the fractional part of na. The problem is to prove that this sequence is dense in [0,1], meaning every subinterval (a,b) within [0,1] contains at least one element of the sequence.\n\nWait, in the example provided, the assumption included specific conditions on n. In this case, the user mentions that a is irrational, and n is any integer ≥1. So the assumptions should be:\n\n- a is an irrational number.\n- n is an integer such that n ≥ 1.\n- The sequence is defined as (na - floor(na)), which is the fractional part of na.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement is about the denseness in [0,1]. The original question might have a typo or confusion between (0,1) and [0,1], but since the user wrote \"dense in [0,1]\" in the title, but in the problem description says \"dense in (0,1)\", there's a discrepancy. However, usually, denseness in [0,1] would include the endpoints, but since the fractional parts are in [0,1), the sequence is actually dense in [0,1). But the user mentions the interval (a,b) as a subset of (0,1), so maybe the problem is to show it's dense in (0,1). Hmm, but the standard result is that the fractional parts of multiples of an irrational number are dense in [0,1). The user's title says [0,1], but the problem statement in the question says (0,1). Need to check.\n\nBut the user wrote the title as \"Proving that the terms of the sequence (nx−⌊nx⌋) is dense in [0,1].\" and in the problem description says \"Prove that na mod1 is dense in (0,1)..where a is an Irrational number , n≥1\". So there's inconsistency here. However, the standard result is dense in [0,1), but the user mentions both [0,1] and (0,1). Maybe the problem should state dense in [0,1], but the user's actual question says (0,1). I need to clarify which one. Since the user is asking, perhaps the problem as given in their question is to prove dense in (0,1), but the title says [0,1]. However, when structuring the problem, maybe we should take the problem as stated in the main question, which is \"Prove that na mod1 is dense in (0,1)\".\n\nBut wait, the user's original problem in their own words is: \"Prove that na mod1 is dense in (0,1)..where a is an Irrational number , n≥1\". So the problem as per the user is to show that for any interval (a,b) within (0,1), there's a term of the sequence in it. The title says [0,1], but the problem says (0,1). The answer would need to address that. But when structuring the problem, the assumptions should capture the conditions given. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- a is an irrational number.\n- n is an integer with n ≥ 1.\n- The sequence is defined by na mod1 (i.e., fractional part of na).\n- The problem is to prove that the sequence is dense in (0,1).\n\nBut wait, the user's title mentions [0,1], but the problem statement in the question says (0,1). Which one is correct? Well, in the problem description, the user writes: \"Prove that na mod1 is dense in (0,1)..where a is an Irrational number , n≥1\". Therefore, the problem as per the user's own words is about (0,1). However, the title might have a mistake. Therefore, the correct problem is as per the problem statement, not the title. So the problem is to prove that the sequence is dense in (0,1).\n\nBut in reality, the fractional parts of na mod1 are dense in [0,1), not just (0,1). So the problem might be mistyped. But as per the user's problem statement, we need to structure it as they presented. So assumptions would be:\n\n- a is an irrational number.\n- n is an integer such that n ≥ 1.\n- The sequence is given by the fractional parts of na (i.e., na - floor(na)).\n- The problem is to prove that this sequence is dense in the interval (0,1).\n\nBut wait, the user's original problem says \"dense in [0,1]\" in the title, but in the body says \"dense in (0,1)\". This discrepancy needs to be addressed. However, since the user is asking for help, perhaps the correct problem is the one in the body, i.e., (0,1). Alternatively, maybe the user intended [0,1], and the body has a typo. But since the standard result is that the fractional parts are dense in [0,1), perhaps the problem is to show dense in [0,1]. But I need to follow the user's problem as stated. Let me check again:\n\nThe user's problem statement says: \"Prove that na mod1 is dense in (0,1)..where a is an Irrational number , n≥1...\". So according to that, the problem is about (0,1). But the title is about [0,1]. Therefore, there's inconsistency.\n\nIn such cases, perhaps the problem should be structured based on the main body of the question. Hence, the problem is to prove denseness in (0,1). Alternatively, perhaps the user meant [0,1], but given that the fractional parts are in [0,1), the denseness is in [0,1). But the exact problem as per the user's question in the body is (0,1). However, the title might be a mistake. To resolve this, perhaps the correct problem is to prove denseness in [0,1], as per the title, but the body says (0,1). However, in any case, when structuring, we need to capture the user's problem accurately. Since the user's actual question in the body is about (0,1), I'll go with that.\n\nThus, the assumptions are:\n\n- a is an irrational number.\n- n is an integer greater than or equal to 1.\n- The sequence is the fractional part of na (i.e., na mod1 = na - floor(na)).\n- The problem is to prove that this sequence is dense in (0,1).\n\nWait, but the standard result is that the sequence is dense in [0,1), which includes 0 but not 1. However, (0,1) excludes 0. But the problem as stated by the user is to prove denseness in (0,1), which is slightly different. But maybe the user made a mistake here. However, since the user is asking, perhaps the problem is as they stated. Therefore, the problem is to prove that for any interval (a,b) within (0,1), there exists some n ≥1 such that the fractional part of na is in (a,b). So the formatted problem should reflect this.\n\nTherefore, the structured problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- a is an irrational number.\n- n is an integer such that n ≥ 1.\n- The sequence is defined by the fractional part of na (i.e., na mod1).\nProblem:\nProve that the sequence (na mod1) is dense in the interval (0,1).\n\nBut wait, the original title mentions the sequence (nx - floor(nx)), which is the same as na mod1 if x is a. So in the problem statement, the user probably meant x to be a. Therefore, the problem is correctly structured with a as the irrational number.\n\nAnother thing to check: The problem mentions \"the terms of the sequence (nx - floor(nx)) is dense in [0,1]\". So maybe x is the irrational number. The user's question in the body says \"na mod1\" where a is irrational. So x is a. So the variables are consistent.\n\nSo the final assumptions are:\n\n- a is an irrational number.\n- n is an integer with n ≥ 1.\n- The sequence is defined as the fractional part of na (i.e., na - floor(na)).\n\nProblem: Prove that the sequence is dense in (0,1).\n\nWait, but the title says [0,1], but the body says (0,1). To resolve this, perhaps the problem should state the interval as [0,1], but given that fractional parts are in [0,1), the correct interval should be [0,1). However, the user's problem statement in the body says (0,1), so maybe that's their intended problem, even though the title says [0,1]. Therefore, the formatted problem should follow the body's problem statement.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n- a is an irrational number.\n- n is an integer where n ≥ 1.\n- The sequence is defined by the fractional part of na (i.e., na mod1).\nProblem:\nProve that the sequence (na mod1) is dense in the interval (0,1).\n\nWait, but the standard result is that the fractional parts are dense in [0,1), not (0,1). So perhaps the problem as stated by the user is incorrect, but we need to structure it as per their question. Therefore, the formatted problem would follow the user's problem statement, even if it's slightly inaccurate. Hence, the problem is to prove denseness in (0,1).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended [0,1], and the body's (0,1) is a typo. However, since the user wrote both, but the title is Proving denseness in [0,1], and the body says (0,1), perhaps the correct interval is [0,1]. But fractional parts can't be 1, so it's [0,1). However, in real analysis, sometimes people refer to [0,1] when meaning the interval from 0 to 1 inclusive, but the fractional part is strictly less than 1. Therefore, the correct interval should be [0,1). But the user's problem says (0,1) in the body. So there's a conflict.\n\nGiven that the user is asking for help, perhaps they have a confusion here. However, for the purpose of structuring the problem as per their question, we should follow their exact wording. Hence, the problem is as stated in the body: Prove that na mod1 is dense in (0,1) where a is irrational, n≥1.\n\nThus, the final formatted problem is:\n\nAssumption:\n- a is an irrational number.\n- n is an integer with n ≥ 1.\n- The sequence is defined as na mod1.\nProblem:\nProve that the sequence (na mod1) is dense in the interval (0,1).\n\nBut I need to check the example given in the instruction. The example lists assumptions line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. In the example, the assumptions were:\n\n- n is an integer,\n- n is divisible by 7.\n\nHere, the first assumption is that n is an integer, the second that n is divisible by 7. Similarly, in our case, the assumptions should be:\n\n1. a is an irrational number.\n2. n is an integer with n ≥ 1.\n3. The sequence terms are na mod1 (fractional parts of na).\n\nBut wait, the third assumption is about the definition of the sequence, which is part of the problem statement. However, in the example, the assumption included the divisibility condition. So perhaps in this case, the definition of the sequence is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n1. a is an irrational number.\n2. n is an integer where n ≥ 1.\n\nThe problem statement then is: Prove that the sequence (nx - floor(nx)) (i.e., na mod1) is dense in [0,1] (or (0,1) as per the body).\n\nBut the user's original problem mentions both the title and the body, which conflict. However, the main body of the question says \"Prove that na mod1 is dense in (0,1)..where a is an Irrational number , n≥1\".\n\nSo perhaps the correct formatting is:\n\nAssumption:\n- a is an irrational number.\n- n is an integer with n ≥ 1.\nProblem:\nProve that the sequence defined by na mod1 is dense in (0,1).\n\nAlternatively, if the sequence's definition is considered part of the problem statement, then it's included in the problem line.\n\nBut in the example given, the problem includes the definition of A(n), so maybe the definition of the sequence is part of the problem statement. Hence:\n\nAssumption:\n- a is an irrational number.\n- n is an integer with n ≥ 1.\nProblem:\nProve that the sequence (na mod1) is dense in (0,1).\n\nYes, that seems correct. The assumptions are the conditions given (a is irrational, n is integer ≥1), and the problem is to prove the density of the defined sequence in the interval.",
