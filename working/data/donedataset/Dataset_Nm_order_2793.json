    "AcceptedAnswer": "EDITED. Here is yet another answer based on my recent answer . Indeed, if $P$ is a non-constant polynomial with coefficients in $\\mathbb{R}$ such that $P(n) \\to +\\infty$ as $n \\to +\\infty$, one immediately deduces from the result in the link that $$ \\lim_{x \\uparrow 1^-} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (-1)^n x^{P(n)}\n= \\lim_{s \\to 0^+} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (-1)^n e^{-P(n)s}\n= \\frac{1}{2}, $$ which entails OP's question as a special case with $P(n) = n^2$. Here is an elementary derivation. First, let $g : (0,\\infty) \\times (0, 1) \\to \\mathbb{R}$ by $$ g(a,x) = \\frac{1 - x^{a}}{1 - x^{2a+2}}. $$ We make the following observations on $g$. Observation. $g$ is increasing in $a$ and non-increasing in $x$. Its proof is more of less calculus computations, so we leave it to the end. To see how this function is related to our problem, notice that $$ f(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (-1)^n x^{n^2} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\left( x^{4n^2} - x^{4(n+1)^2} \\right) g(4n+1, x). $$ We prove that liminf and limsup of $f(x)$ as $x \\uparrow 1$ are both $\\frac{1}{2}$. Liminf. An immediate consequence is that $g(4n+1, x) \\geq \\lim_{r\\uparrow 1}g(4n+1, r) = \\frac{4n+1}{8n+4}$. So for each fixed $N \\geq 1$, we can bound $f(x)$ below first by truncating first $N$ terms and then by utilizing the aforementioned lower bound of $g(4n+1, x)$: \\begin{align*}\nf(x)\n&\\geq \\sum_{n=N}^{\\infty} \\left( x^{4n^2} - x^{4(n+1)^2} \\right) \\frac{4n+1}{8n+4} \\\\\n&\\geq \\frac{4N+1}{8N+4} \\sum_{n=N}^{\\infty} \\left( x^{4n^2} - x^{4(n+1)^2} \\right)\n = \\frac{4N+1}{8N+4} x^{4N^2}.\n\\end{align*} So it follows that $$ \\liminf_{x\\uparrow 1}f(x) \\geq \\frac{4N+1}{8N+1} \\xrightarrow[\\quad N\\to\\infty \\quad]{} \\frac{1}{2}. $$ Limsup. For the other direction, fix $\\epsilon > 0$ and define $N = N(\\epsilon, x) = \\lfloor \\epsilon / \\log(1/x) \\rfloor$. Then for $x$ close to $1$, the sum of first $N$ terms can be bounded by using $g(4n+1, x) \\leq g(4N-3, x)$: \\begin{align*}\n\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \\left( x^{4n^2} - x^{4(n+1)^2} \\right) g(4n+1, x)\n&\\leq \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \\left( x^{4n^2} - x^{4(n+1)^2} \\right) g(4N-3,x) \\\\\n&\\leq g(4N-3,x)\n = \\frac{1 - e^{(4N-3)\\log x}}{1 - e^{(8N-4)\\log x}} \\\\\n&\\to \\frac{1-e^{-4\\epsilon}}{1-e^{-8\\epsilon}} \\quad \\text{as } N \\to \\infty.\n\\end{align*} For the remaining terms, we may utilize $g(4n+1, x) \\leq g(\\infty,x) = 1$ to obtain \\begin{align*}\n\\sum_{n=N}^{\\infty} \\left( x^{4n^2} - x^{4(n+1)^2} \\right) g(4n+1, x)\n&\\leq \\sum_{n=N}^{\\infty} \\left( x^{4n^2} - x^{4(n+1)^2} \\right) \\\\\n&= x^{4N^2}\n= e^{4N^2 \\log x}\n \\to 0 \\quad \\text{as } N \\to \\infty.\n\\end{align*} So it follows that $$ \\limsup_{x\\uparrow 1}f(x)\n\\leq \\frac{1-e^{-4\\epsilon}}{1-e^{-8\\epsilon}}\n\\xrightarrow[\\quad \\epsilon \\downarrow 0 \\quad]{} \\frac{1}{2}. $$ Here is the proof of the observation: We notice that $$ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial a}(a,x) = \\frac{x^a \\log (1/x)}{(1-x^{2a+2})^2} \\left(x^{2a+2}-2 x^{a+2}+1\\right) > 0 $$ since $x^{2a+2}-2 x^{a+2}+1 = x^2(x^a - 1)^2 + (1-x^2) > 0$. So $g$ is increasing in $a$ for any $x \\in (0, 1)$. Similarly, we find that $$ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}(a,x) = - \\frac{x^{a-1}}{(1-x^{2a+2})^2} \\left( (a+2)x^{2a+2} + a - (2a+2) x^{a+2} \\right). $$ By the AM-GM inequality, we have $$ \\frac{a+2}{2a+2} \\cdot x^{2a+2} + \\frac{a}{2a+2} \\cdot 1 \\geq x^{a+2} $$ and hence $g$ is non-increasing in $x$ for any $a \\in (0, \\infty)$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants to prove that the limit as x approaches 1 from the left of the series sum_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n x^{n²} is equal to 1/2. Hmm, this seems like an alternating series where each term is raised to the power of n squared, multiplied by x^{n²}. \n\nFirst, I remember that for power series, the radius of convergence is important. But here, the exponent is n² instead of n, so it's not a standard power series. Maybe it's related to a theta function or something similar? But I'm not sure. The question mentions bringing this back to the study of usual power series, so maybe there's a way to relate this series to a more familiar form.\n\nSince the limit is as x approaches 1 from below, we're dealing with the behavior near the boundary of the radius of convergence. The series alternates in sign, which might suggest using the Alternating Series Test, but that's for convergence of the series itself, not for the limit. Wait, but as x approaches 1, the terms x^{n²} approach 1, so each term becomes (-1)^n. The series sum_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n diverges because it oscillates between 0 and 1. However, with the x^{n²} factor, maybe there's some averaging or summability method involved here, like Abel summation?\n\nAbel's theorem states that if a series converges to S, then the limit as x approaches 1 from below of the sum a_n x^n is also S. But in this case, the original series sum (-1)^n doesn't converge, so Abel's theorem doesn't directly apply. But perhaps there's a generalized Abel summability here? Or maybe we can use some integral transformation?\n\nAlternatively, since the exponent is n², maybe we can relate this to a Jacobi theta function, which has terms like sum_{n=-∞}^∞ q^{n²} for some q. But the given series starts at n=0 and includes (-1)^n. So maybe split it into even and odd terms? Let's see:\n\nsum_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n x^{n²} = sum_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^{2k} x^{(2k)^2} + sum_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^{2k+1} x^{(2k+1)^2}  \n= sum_{k=0}^∞ x^{4k²} - sum_{k=0}^∞ x^{(2k+1)^2}\n\nBut I'm not sure if splitting helps directly. Another thought: Maybe approximate the sum using integrals? For large n, the terms x^{n²} decay rapidly as x approaches 1, but near x=1, the decay is slower. Wait, when x is very close to 1, say x = 1 - ε with ε small, then x^{n²} ≈ e^{-ε n²}. So as ε approaches 0, we have sum_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n e^{-ε n²}. This resembles a theta function with an alternating sign. \n\nI recall that for theta functions, there are transformation formulas that relate sums over n to sums over some dual variable, often involving Poisson summation. But with the alternating sign, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe approximate the sum as an integral for small ε. For small ε, the sum can be approximated by an integral from n=0 to ∞ of (-1)^n e^{-ε n²} dn. But n is discrete, so perhaps using Euler-Maclaurin formula?\n\nAlternatively, consider using the integral representation of the sum. Let's write the sum as S(x) = sum_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n x^{n²}. Notice that x^{n²} = e^{n² ln x}. As x approaches 1 from below, ln x ≈ -(1 - x). So let's set t = 1 - x, so t approaches 0+. Then ln x ≈ -t, and S(x) ≈ sum_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n e^{-t n²}. Now, this looks similar to a Dirichlet generating function or a Mellin transform.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe use the fact that sum_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n x^{n²} can be related to a Jacobi theta function. The theta function is θ(z, τ) = sum_{n=-∞}^∞ e^{πi n² τ + 2πi n z}, but with our parameters, maybe we can adjust variables. However, the alternating sign complicates things. Let's note that (-1)^n = e^{iπ n}, so the sum becomes sum_{n=0}^∞ e^{iπ n} x^{n²} = sum_{n=0}^∞ e^{iπ n + n² ln x}. Let’s set τ such that e^{πi τ} = x, but this might not be straightforward. Alternatively, set q = x, so the sum is sum_{n=0}^\\infty (-1)^n q^{n²}. \n\nWait, there's a known function called the Jacobi theta function θ_4, which is sum_{n=-∞}^\\infty (-1)^n q^{n²} = 1 + 2 sum_{n=1}^\\infty (-1)^n q^{n²}. So our sum S(q) is (θ_4(0, q) + 1)/2. But as q approaches 1, what happens to θ_4? The behavior near q=1 (or the nome approaching certain values) might be known. However, I'm not sure about the exact asymptotic here.\n\nAlternatively, consider using Poisson summation formula. The Poisson summation formula relates a sum over n to a sum over its Fourier transform. For the function f(n) = (-1)^n x^{n²}, the Fourier transform might be complicated, but perhaps manageable. Let's write the sum as sum_{n=-∞}^\\infty f(n), but since our original sum starts at n=0, we need to adjust. However, if we consider the sum from n=-∞ to ∞, it's symmetric except for the n=0 term. But since n² is even in n, and (-1)^n is not, maybe this approach isn't straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, consider using the integral test or some approximation. Let's think about the sum S(x) = sum_{n=0}^\\infty (-1)^n x^{n²}. As x approaches 1-, the terms oscillate but decay slowly. The partial sums might be approaching 1/2 in some averaged sense. This reminds me of the concept of Cesàro summation or Abel summation for divergent series. Since the series is sum (-1)^n x^{n²}, when x approaches 1, it's like the Abel sum of the divergent series sum (-1)^n. The Abel sum would be lim_{x→1-} sum_{n=0}^\\infty (-1)^n x^n = lim_{x→1-} 1/(1 + x) = 1/2. But in our problem, the exponent is n² instead of n. So maybe there's a similar effect here, where the Abel-type sum gives 1/2 even though the exponents are different?\n\nBut why would the limit still be 1/2? The original Abel sum for sum (-1)^n x^n converges to 1/2 as x approaches 1. Maybe the additional exponent n² in x^{n²} makes the higher terms decay faster, but as x approaches 1, the decay is slower. However, even so, perhaps the oscillations still average out to 1/2. Is there a general result that if you have a series sum (-1)^n a_n(x) where a_n(x) approaches 1 as x approaches some point, then the Abel sum is 1/2? Not exactly, but maybe under certain conditions.\n\nAlternatively, consider using the integral representation. Suppose we write the sum as S(x) = sum_{n=0}^\\infty (-1)^n e^{n² ln x}. Let t = -ln x, so as x approaches 1 from below, t approaches 0+. Then S(x) = sum_{n=0}^\\infty (-1)^n e^{-t n²}. This resembles the partition function in statistical mechanics, but with alternating signs. Maybe express this sum using an integral. For example, using the integral representation of e^{-t n²} = integral from 0 to ∞ of e^{-s t} ds where s = n²? Not sure. Alternatively, using the fact that e^{-t n²} is the Laplace transform of a delta function, but that might not help.\n\nAnother idea: Use the generating function for the sum. Let's consider S(t) = sum_{n=0}^\\infty (-1)^n e^{-t n²}. We want the limit as t→0+. Maybe expand this sum in terms of t. For small t, the terms e^{-t n²} ≈ 1 - t n² + t² n^4 / 2 - ... So S(t) ≈ sum (-1)^n [1 - t n² + ...]. Then, term by term, sum (-1)^n = 1/2 (divergent, but in some regularized sense), sum (-1)^n n² = -1/4, etc. But this approach seems heuristic and not rigorous. However, if we take the leading term as the regularized sum, which is 1/2, then maybe S(t) approaches 1/2 as t→0. But how to make this rigorous?\n\nAlternatively, consider pairing the terms. Let's group terms in pairs: for each k, group n=2k and n=2k+1. Then, S(x) = sum_{k=0}^\\infty [x^{(2k)^2} - x^{(2k+1)^2}]. Each pair is x^{4k²} - x^{4k² +4k +1} = x^{4k²}(1 - x^{4k +1}). As x approaches 1, 1 - x^{4k +1} ≈ (4k +1)(1 - x). So each term is approximately (4k +1)(1 - x) x^{4k²}. Then, sum over k, the sum becomes (1 - x) sum_{k=0}^\\infty (4k +1) x^{4k²}. But as x→1-, 1 - x approaches 0. The sum sum_{k=0}^\\infty (4k +1) x^{4k²} might approach a constant or diverge. Wait, when x is approaching 1, x^{4k²} ≈ e^{-4k² t} where t = -ln x ≈ 1 - x. So sum (4k +1) e^{-4k² t}. For small t, the dominant terms are when k is small. As t→0, the sum behaves like the first few terms. But integrating over k, approximating the sum by an integral: sum_{k=0}^\\infty (4k +1) e^{-4k² t} ≈ integral_{k=0}^\\infty (4k +1) e^{-4k² t} dk. Let’s change variable: let u = k sqrt(t), then dk = du / sqrt(t). The integral becomes integral_{u=0}^\\infty [4 (u / sqrt(t)) +1] e^{-4 u²} (du / sqrt(t)) = (4 / t) integral u e^{-4u²} du / sqrt(t) + integral e^{-4u²} du / sqrt(t). The first term is (4 / t^{3/2}) integral u e^{-4u²} du = (4 / t^{3/2})(1/(8)) ) = (4 / t^{3/2})(1/8) = 1/(2 t^{3/2}). The second term is (1 / sqrt(t)) integral e^{-4u²} du = (1 / sqrt(t)) * (sqrt(π)/(2 sqrt(4))) ) = (1 / sqrt(t)) * (sqrt(π)/4). So as t→0, the leading term is 1/(2 t^{3/2}), which goes to infinity. Therefore, the sum sum_{k=0}^\\infty (4k +1) x^{4k²} ≈ 1/(2 t^{3/2}) ) = 1/(2 (1 - x)^{3/2}). Then, S(x) ≈ (1 - x) * [1/(2 (1 - x)^{3/2})] ) = 1/(2 sqrt(1 - x)) → ∞ as x→1-. But this contradicts the original problem's assertion that the limit is 1/2. So maybe this approach isn't correct.\n\nWait, perhaps my approximation is flawed. When I paired the terms, maybe I lost some cancellation. Alternatively, maybe the approach of expanding the terms as 1 - x^{4k +1} ≈ (4k +1)(1 - x) is too crude, because x^{4k +1} = e^{(4k +1) ln x} ≈ 1 + (4k +1) ln x. But ln x ≈ -(1 - x) - (1 - x)^2/2 - ... So maybe x^{4k +1} ≈ 1 - (4k +1)(1 - x). Therefore, 1 - x^{4k +1} ≈ (4k +1)(1 - x). But multiplying by x^{4k²} ≈ 1 - 4k² (1 - x). Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe higher-order terms are needed here.\n\nAlternatively, consider using the Euler-Maclaurin formula to approximate the sum. The Euler-Maclaurin formula relates sums to integrals plus correction terms. For S(x) = sum_{n=0}^\\infty (-1)^n x^{n²}, maybe express it as sum_{n=0}^\\infty (-1)^n e^{-t n²} with t = -ln x. Then, as t→0+, approximate the sum using integrals and boundary terms. However, because of the alternating sign, the Euler-Maclaurin might have oscillatory terms that are hard to handle.\n\nAnother approach: Use generating functions or known series. Let's recall that sum_{n=0}^\\infty (-1)^n x^{n²} is a special function, but I'm not sure of its properties. Alternatively, relate it to the Jacobi theta function θ_4(0, x) = sum_{n=-∞}^\\infty (-1)^n x^{n²} = 1 + 2 sum_{n=1}^\\infty (-1)^n x^{n²}. So our sum is (θ_4(0, x) + 1)/2. Therefore, S(x) = (θ_4(0, x) + 1)/2. Now, we need to find the limit as x approaches 1 from below of S(x). The behavior of θ_4 near x=1 (or q=1) is known in terms of modular transformations. The Jacobi theta functions satisfy modularity properties that relate their values at q and e^{-π² / ln q}, or something similar. \n\nSpecifically, the modular transformation for θ_4 is something like θ_4(0, e^{-π t}) = (t)^{1/2} θ_2(0, e^{-π / t}). But I might be mixing up the exact formula. Let me check: The Jacobi theta functions have modularity properties. For example, θ_3(0, e^{-π t}) = (1/√t) θ_3(0, e^{-π / t}). Similarly for θ_4. If we can express x in terms that allow applying such a transformation, perhaps we can find the behavior as x→1-.\n\nLet’s set x = e^{-ε}, so as x approaches 1-, ε approaches 0+. Then θ_4(0, e^{-ε}) = sum_{n=-∞}^\\infty (-1)^n e^{-ε n²}. Using the modular transformation, θ_4(0, e^{-ε}) = sqrt(π/ε) θ_2(0, e^{-π² / ε}) or something similar. Wait, perhaps more precisely, the transformation formula for theta functions is:\n\nθ_4(0, e^{-π t}) = (1/√t) θ_2(0, e^{-π / t}).\n\nBut in our case, x = e^{-ε}, so to match the form e^{-π t}, we set ε = π t, so t = ε/π. Then the transformation gives θ_4(0, e^{-ε}) = sqrt(π/ε) θ_2(0, e^{-π² / ε}).\n\nAs ε→0+, π² / ε → ∞, so e^{-π² / ε} approaches 0 very rapidly. Therefore, θ_2(0, e^{-π² / ε}) = sum_{n=-∞}^\\infty e^{-π² (n + 1/2)^2 / ε} (this is the definition of θ_2). As the exponent becomes very negative, all terms except n= -1 and n=0 might vanish. Wait, for n=-1: (n + 1/2) = -1 + 1/2 = -1/2, so squared is 1/4. For n=0: (0 + 1/2)^2 = 1/4. For n=1: (1 + 1/2)^2 = 9/4. So the terms for n=-1 and n=0 are e^{-π² (1/4)/ε} and others decay exponentially faster. Therefore, θ_2(0, e^{-π² / ε}) ≈ 2 e^{-π²/(4ε)}. Therefore, θ_4(0, e^{-ε}) ≈ sqrt(π/ε) * 2 e^{-π²/(4ε)}. \n\nTherefore, S(x) = (θ_4(0, x) + 1)/2 ≈ [sqrt(π/ε) * 2 e^{-π²/(4ε)} + 1]/2. As ε→0+, the exponential term e^{-π²/(4ε)} goes to zero extremely rapidly, so the dominant term is 1/2. Hence, the limit is 1/2. Therefore, the original problem's assertion is correct.\n\nSo the key steps are recognizing the relation to the theta function, applying the modular transformation, and showing that the non-constant terms vanish exponentially fast as x approaches 1 from below, leaving the constant term 1/2. Therefore, the limit is indeed 1/2.",
