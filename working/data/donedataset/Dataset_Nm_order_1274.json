    "Content": "I'm just wondering about my proof for the following fact. I get the feeling it is almost trivial but I am still getting a feel for geometry and so it doesn't seem 'obvious' to me just yet. The projection $\\pi$ of the fiber bundle $(E,\\pi,M,F)$ is a submersion. Is the below argument a correct proof of this fact? Would it be considered 'the obvious' proof? To show $\\pi$ is a submersion, we must show that for each $p\\in E$, the differential $d\\pi_p:T_pE\\rightarrow T_{\\pi(p)}M$ is surjective. Since, $(E,\\pi,M,F)$ is a fiber bundle, there exists a neighbourhood $U\\subseteq M$ containing $\\pi(p)$ and diffeomorphism $\\phi:\\pi^{-1}(U)\\rightarrow U\\times F$ , such that $\\pi|_{\\pi^{-1}(U)}=\\pi_1\\circ \\phi:\\pi^{-1}(U)\\rightarrow U$. Thus, showing $d\\pi_p$ is surjective is equivalent to showing $d(\\pi_1\\circ \\phi)_p={d\\pi_1}_{\\phi(p)}\\circ d\\phi_p$ is surjective. Since $\\phi$ is a diffeomorphism, $d\\phi_{p}$ is an isomorphism, so it is surjective. Furthermore, ${d\\pi_1}_{\\phi(p)}$ is surjective since projection onto the first factor is a submersion. Since the composition of two surjections is a surjection itself, it follows that ${d\\pi_1}_{\\phi(p)}\\circ d\\phi_p=d\\pi_p$ is surjective. Thus, $\\pi$ is a submersion.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Yes your proof is correct. You can formulate it a little bit shorter as follows: a map is a submersion if and only if there exists local charts such that the representation of the map in this charts is a projection (one direction is very easy, the converse follows from the inverse function theorem). Now for the projection of a fibre bundle, we just take a local trivialization $\\pi^{-1}(U) \\to U \\times F$ and observe that the local representation of the bundle projection is the projection on the first factor. Essentially, this boils down to your argument.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants to know if their proof that the projection of a fiber bundle is a submersion is correct. They also ask if this is considered the obvious proof. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the definitions involved. A fiber bundle consists of a total space E, a base space M, a projection map π: E → M, and a fiber F. The key property is that around every point in M, there's a neighborhood U such that π^{-1}(U) is diffeomorphic to U × F, and this diffeomorphism φ must satisfy π = π₁ ∘ φ, where π₁ is the projection onto U. \n\nThe goal is to show that π is a submersion, which means that for every point p in E, the differential dπ_p: T_p E → T_{π(p)} M is surjective. \n\nThe user's argument goes like this: Take a point p in E. There exists a local trivialization φ around π(p), so on π^{-1}(U), π is equal to π₁ ∘ φ. They then consider the differential of π at p, which is the composition of the differential of φ at p (dφ_p) followed by the differential of π₁ at φ(p) (d(π₁)_{φ(p)}). Since φ is a diffeomorphism, dφ_p is an isomorphism, hence surjective. Then, π₁ is a projection map, which is a submersion, so its differential is surjective. The composition of two surjective maps is surjective, hence dπ_p is surjective. Therefore, π is a submersion.\n\nLet me check each step. \n\n1. Local trivialization: Yes, by definition of a fiber bundle, such a φ exists. So π restricted to π^{-1}(U) is indeed π₁ ∘ φ. \n\n2. The differential of a composition is the composition of differentials: That's the chain rule, correct.\n\n3. φ is a diffeomorphism, so its differential is an isomorphism (hence bijective, so surjective): Correct. \n\n4. π₁: U × F → U is the projection. Projection maps are submersions because their differentials are surjective. For any point (u,f) in U × F, the tangent space is T_u U × T_f F. The differential dπ₁ projects this to T_u U, which is surjective. So that's correct. \n\n5. The composition of surjective linear maps is surjective: Yes, if you have two linear maps, the composition's image is the image of the second map applied to the image of the first. Since the first map (dφ_p) is surjective, the image is the entire T_{φ(p)}(U × F). Then applying dπ₁, which is surjective, maps that onto T_{π(p)} U = T_{π(p)} M (since U is an open subset of M, the tangent spaces are the same). Therefore, the composition is surjective. \n\nSo each step in the user's proof seems valid. The key points are using the local trivialization to express π as a composition of a diffeomorphism and a projection, then leveraging the properties of those maps. \n\nIs this considered the obvious proof? Well, in differential geometry, when dealing with fiber bundles, the local trivialization is a fundamental tool. So using it to verify properties of the projection map is standard. Since the projection in the local trivialization is a submersion, and diffeomorphisms preserve such properties, this approach is indeed the straightforward or \"obvious\" method. The user might feel it's non-obvious if they're still getting comfortable with how local trivializations work, but once familiar, this is a natural path.\n\nPotential points to check: Did they handle the local vs global aspect correctly? The argument is local around each point p, but since the conclusion holds for every p, it's sufficient. Also, ensuring that the differential of the projection π₁ is indeed surjective, which it is because it's a projection. \n\nAnother thing: They mention that the composition of two surjections is a surjection. That's correct in set theory, but here we're dealing with linear maps between vector spaces. The composition of surjective linear maps is indeed surjective, so that's fine. \n\nI don't see any gaps in the logic. The user has correctly applied the definitions and properties of fiber bundles, diffeomorphisms, and submersions. Therefore, their proof is correct and this would be considered the standard approach.",
