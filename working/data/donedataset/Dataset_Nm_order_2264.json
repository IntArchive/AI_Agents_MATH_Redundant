    "Content": "Consider the subring $R=k[x,xy,xy^2,\\ldots]$ of $k[x,y]$ . I want to prove that $R$ is not noetherian. An ascending chain of ideals is the following: $$(x)\\subset(x,xy)\\subset(x,xy,xy^2)\\subset\\cdots$$ It is intuitively clearly to me that this is an ascending chain of ideals. But how do I prove it rigorously that $$xy^n \\notin (x,xy,xy^2,\\ldots,xy^{n-1})$$ or that this chain of ideals can never stabillize?",

Then for a finite sum $f=\\sum_lf_l$ of polynomials we have $[f]_{i,j }=\\sum [f_l]_{i,j}$ Proof that $xy^n \\notin (x,xy,xy^2,\\ldots,xy^{n-1})$ Suppose that $xy^n=\\sum _{l=0}^{n-1}g_lxy^l$ with $g_l\\in R$. From the preliminary remark we get $$  xy^n=[xy^n]_{1,n}=[\\sum _{l=0}^{n-1}g_lxy^l]_{1,n}\\stackrel{prel.rem.}{=} \\sum _{l=0}^{n-1}[g_lxy^l]_{1,n}=\\sum _{l=0}^{n-1}[g_l]_{0,n-l}xy^l$$  But all $[g_l]_{0,n-l}=0$ since $n-l\\gt0$  and all non-constant terms of a polynomial in $R$ involve a positive power of $x$.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let's try to tackle this problem. The user wants to show that the ring R = k[x, xy, xy², ...] is not Noetherian by demonstrating an infinite ascending chain of ideals that doesn't stabilize. The chain given is (x) ⊂ (x, xy) ⊂ (x, xy, xy²) ⊂ ... and they need to prove that each subsequent ideal is strictly larger, meaning xy^n isn't in the ideal generated by x, xy, ..., xy^{n-1}.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand the structure of R. R is a subring of k[x,y] generated by x, xy, xy², etc. So every element of R can be written as a polynomial in these generators. But since each generator after x is xy^n, multiplying by y increases the power of y each time. However, R doesn't include y by itself, only in the form of xy^n.\n\nNow, the chain of ideals is constructed by adding each new generator xy^n step by step. To show the chain doesn't stabilize, we need to show that each new ideal is strictly larger than the previous one. That is, xy^n is not in the ideal (x, xy, ..., xy^{n-1}).\n\nLet me think about how elements of these ideals look. An element in (x, xy, ..., xy^{n-1}) would be a linear combination of these generators with coefficients in R. So, for example, any element in (x, xy) can be written as a*x + b*xy where a, b ∈ R. Similarly, higher ideals include more terms.\n\nSuppose, for contradiction, that xy^n is in (x, xy, ..., xy^{n-1}). Then, we can write xy^n = a_0*x + a_1*xy + ... + a_{n-1}*xy^{n-1} where each a_i is in R.\n\nBut since R is a subring generated by x, xy, xy², ..., each a_i is a polynomial in these variables. Let's consider the degrees in y. The left-hand side, xy^n, has a term with y^n. On the right-hand side, each term a_i*xy^i would be a combination of terms where the highest power of y would be up to i plus the degrees from a_i. But since a_i is in R, which is generated by x, xy, etc., any element in R can be written as a polynomial in x and xy, xy², etc., but each of those generators have terms with y^m where m is up to some finite number. However, multiplying these generators together would result in terms where the exponents of y are sums of the exponents from the factors. For example, xy^m * xy^n = x² y^{m+n}, but since we can only get higher exponents by multiplying existing terms.\n\nWait, but in the coefficients a_i, since they are elements of R, they can have terms with various powers of y, but each term in a_i would have at least one x, right? Because all generators of R have an x. So, R is a subring where every element is a polynomial in x and y, but every term must have at least one x. For example, you can't have a term like y by itself; it has to be multiplied by x.\n\nSo, considering that, when we look at the equation xy^n = a_0*x + a_1*xy + ... + a_{n-1}*xy^{n-1}, each term on the right side is a product of a_i (which is in R, so each term in a_i has at least one x) multiplied by xy^i. Therefore, each term in the right-hand side will have at least x multiplied by x (from a_i) times y^i, so x² y^i. But the left-hand side is xy^n, which only has x to the first power. This seems like a contradiction because the right side has terms with x², while the left side has x. Therefore, unless all the coefficients a_i have x in them, but then the degrees of x would be higher. Wait, but maybe this is a way to approach it.\n\nWait, let's think again. Suppose we have xy^n = a_0*x + a_1*xy + ... + a_{n-1}*xy^{n-1}, with a_i ∈ R. Since R is a ring, the a_i can be any elements of R, so they can be polynomials in x, xy, etc. However, every term in each a_i must have at least one x. Let's consider the coefficient of x in both sides. On the left-hand side, the coefficient of x (considering x as a variable) is y^n. On the right-hand side, each term a_i*xy^i would have a coefficient (from a_i) multiplied by xy^i. But since a_i is in R, which is generated by x, xy, etc., each term in a_i has at least one x. Therefore, each a_i can be written as x times some polynomial in x, xy, etc. Let's denote a_i = x * b_i, where b_i ∈ R. Then substituting back, we get:\n\nxy^n = x*b_0*x + x*b_1*xy + ... + x*b_{n-1}*xy^{n-1}\n\nSimplifying each term:\n\nx*b_0*x = x² b_0\n\nx*b_i*xy^i = x² b_i y^i\n\nTherefore, the right-hand side is x² times some combination of elements from R. However, the left-hand side is x y^n, which has degree 1 in x. The right-hand side has degree 2 in x. Therefore, this is impossible unless both sides are zero. But in a polynomial ring over a field (assuming k is a field), this can't happen unless all coefficients are zero, which they aren't. Therefore, there's a contradiction, implying that our initial assumption that xy^n is in the ideal is false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another approach is to use the grading on the ring. Since R is a subring of k[x,y], we can consider the grading by the degree of x. Each generator xy^i has x-degree 1 and y-degree i. If we look at the equation xy^n as an element of the ideal, then each term in the ideal's generators has x-degree at least 1 (since x has x-degree 1, xy has x-degree 1, etc.), but when multiplied by elements of R (which have x-degree at least 1), the total x-degree would be at least 2. However, the left-hand side has x-degree 1, which is less than 2. Therefore, the only way this equation can hold is if all coefficients are zero, which is impossible. Hence, xy^n cannot be in the ideal.\n\nAnother way might be to use substitution or evaluation. Suppose we set x = 0. Then the left-hand side becomes 0, and the right-hand side becomes a sum of terms each involving x, which would also become 0. But this might not help. Alternatively, setting y to some value? Maybe not. Alternatively, consider the quotient ring R/(x). In this quotient, x becomes 0, so all generators xy^i become 0. Therefore, R/(x) is isomorphic to k, perhaps? Then, the image of xy^n in R/(x) is 0, but if we have xy^n in the ideal (x, xy, ..., xy^{n-1}), then modulo x, it would be 0. But this doesn't seem helpful.\n\nAlternatively, consider the ideal (x, xy, ..., xy^{n-1}) in R. If we can show that xy^n is not in this ideal, then the chain doesn't stabilize. Suppose we have a relation xy^n = f_0 x + f_1 xy + ... + f_{n-1} xy^{n-1}, where each f_i is in R. Let's write each f_i as a polynomial in the generators x, xy, xy², etc. Since each f_i is in R, each term in f_i is a product of these generators, hence each term has at least one x. Therefore, each f_i is a polynomial where every term has x at least once. Let's factor out an x from each term on the right-hand side:\n\nxy^n = x [ f_0 + f_1 y + ... + f_{n-1} y^{n-1} ]\n\nDivide both sides by x (since we're in a domain, this is allowed):\n\ny^n = f_0 + f_1 y + ... + f_{n-1} y^{n-1}\n\nBut the left-hand side is y^n, and the right-hand side is a combination of terms where each f_i is a polynomial in x, xy, etc., meaning each f_i has at least one x in every term. However, the right-hand side is now a polynomial in x and y where every term has an x, while the left-hand side is y^n, which has no x. This is a contradiction because y^n cannot be expressed as a combination of terms that all include x. Therefore, no such f_i exist, and hence xy^n is not in the ideal. Therefore, the chain of ideals is strictly ascending, proving that R is not Noetherian.\n\nThis seems like a solid argument. The key idea is that if xy^n were in the ideal, then dividing by x would give y^n as an element of the ideal generated by 1, y, ..., y^{n-1} in the ring k[x,y], but since all coefficients in R require an x, this leads to a contradiction.",
