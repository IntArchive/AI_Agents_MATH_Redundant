    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that x = 2 is the unique real solution to the equation 3^x + 4^x = 5^x. First, I need to understand the problem structure.\n\nSo, the equation involves exponential functions with different bases. Since x is a real number, not just an integer, methods applicable to continuous functions might be needed. The question mentions that it's not a Diophantine equation, so Fermat's Last Theorem isn't directly relevant here. \n\nLet me start by checking x = 2. Plugging in, 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25, which equals 5^2 = 25. So x=2 is indeed a solution. Now, we need to show it's the only one.\n\nPossible approaches: Maybe analyze the function f(x) = 3^x + 4^x - 5^x and show it crosses zero only once. To do that, I can look at the behavior of f(x) as x approaches positive and negative infinity and check its monotonicity.\n\nFor x very large (positive), the terms 3^x, 4^x, and 5^x all grow exponentially, but 5^x grows the fastest. So 5^x will dominate, making f(x) negative. Wait, but at x=2, f(x)=0. Let me see: when x increases beyond 2, 5^x grows faster than 3^x +4^x. So f(x) becomes negative. What about when x is less than 2? For example, x=0: 1 +1 -1 =1 >0. x=1: 3 +4 -5 =2>0. So at x=0, f(x)=1, x=1, f(x)=2, x=2, f(x)=0. So between x=2 and higher, f(x) is negative, and between x approaching negative infinity, maybe f(x) approaches 0 from positive side? Wait, as x becomes very negative, 3^x, 4^x, 5^x all approach zero, but 5^x approaches zero the fastest. So 3^x +4^x would dominate, making f(x) approach zero from positive? Hmm.\n\nWait, when x approaches negative infinity: 3^x = 1/3^|x|, similarly for others. So 1/3^|x| + 1/4^|x| - 1/5^|x|. Since 1/3^|x| and 1/4^|x| are larger than 1/5^|x| for large |x|, so f(x) approaches 0 from positive. So at x approaching -infty, f(x) approaches 0+.\n\nAt x=0, f(0) =1+1-1=1>0. At x=2, f(2)=0. For x>2, let's pick x=3: 27 + 64 - 125 = -34 <0. So the function crosses zero at x=2, and for x>2, it's negative. For x<2, it's positive. But wait, is the function strictly decreasing? If f(x) is strictly decreasing, then it can cross zero only once. So maybe compute the derivative of f(x) to check if it's always decreasing.\n\nf(x) =3^x +4^x -5^x\n\nf’(x) = ln3 *3^x + ln4 *4^x - ln5 *5^x\n\nNeed to check if f’(x) is always negative. Wait, but at x=2, let's compute f’(2):\n\nln3 *9 + ln4 *16 - ln5 *25 ≈ (1.0986*9) + (1.3863*16) - (1.6094*25)\n\n≈9.8874 +22.1808 -40.235 ≈ -8.1668, which is negative. So at x=2, the derivative is negative. For x <2, say x=1: f’(1)= ln3*3 + ln4*4 - ln5*5 ≈1.0986*3 +1.3863*4 -1.6094*5 ≈3.2958 +5.5452 -8.047 ≈0.793, which is positive. So at x=1, derivative is positive, and at x=2, it's negative. That suggests that f(x) has a critical point somewhere between x=1 and x=2 where derivative is zero. Wait, but that would mean the function increases up to that point and then decreases. If that's the case, then the function could cross zero once at x=2 and maybe another time if it goes above zero again. Wait, but we know that at x=2, f(x)=0. Let me see. Suppose there is a maximum somewhere between x=1 and x=2. Let's check f(1.5):\n\n3^1.5 ≈5.196, 4^1.5=8, 5^1.5≈11.180. So f(1.5)=5.196+8-11.180≈2.016>0. Then if the derivative at x=1.5 is positive or negative? Let's compute f’(1.5):\n\nln3 *3^1.5 + ln4 *4^1.5 - ln5 *5^1.5\n\n≈1.0986*5.196 +1.3863*8 -1.6094*11.180\n\n≈5.703 +11.090 -18.0 ≈-1.207. So derivative is negative at x=1.5. Wait, but earlier at x=1, derivative was positive, at x=1.5, it's negative. So the critical point is between x=1 and x=1.5. Let's pick x=1.2:\n\nf’(1.2) = ln3*3^1.2 + ln4*4^1.2 - ln5*5^1.2\n\nCompute 3^1.2 ≈e^(1.2 ln3) ≈e^(1.2*1.0986)=e^1.3183≈3.737\n\nSimilarly, 4^1.2≈e^(1.2 ln4)=e^(1.2*1.3863)=e^1.6635≈5.28\n\n5^1.2≈e^(1.2 ln5)=e^(1.2*1.6094)=e^1.9313≈6.9\n\nSo f’(1.2)≈1.0986*3.737 +1.3863*5.28 -1.6094*6.9 ≈4.104 +7.322 -11.104≈0.322>0\n\nAt x=1.4:\n\n3^1.4≈e^(1.4*1.0986)=e^1.538≈4.656\n\n4^1.4≈e^(1.4*1.3863)=e^1.941≈6.964\n\n5^1.4≈e^(1.4*1.6094)=e^2.253≈9.514\n\nf’(1.4)=1.0986*4.656 +1.3863*6.964 -1.6094*9.514 ≈5.116 +9.644 -15.31≈-0.55\n\nSo between x=1.2 and 1.4, derivative crosses zero from positive to negative. So there's a local maximum somewhere around x=1.3.\n\nCompute f(x) at x=1.3:\n\n3^1.3≈e^1.3*ln3≈e^1.3*1.0986≈e^1.428≈4.17\n\n4^1.3≈e^1.3*ln4≈e^1.3*1.386≈e^1.802≈6.06\n\n5^1.3≈e^1.3*1.6094≈e^2.092≈8.1\n\nf(1.3)=4.17+6.06-8.1≈2.13>0\n\nSo the function reaches a maximum of around 2.13 at x≈1.3, then decreases. At x=2, it's zero. Then continues decreasing for x>2. So since the function is positive at the local maximum and then decreases, crossing zero at x=2, and going to negative infinity as x approaches infinity, and as x approaches negative infinity, approaching zero from positive. Therefore, there's only one real solution at x=2. Because even though there's a local maximum, the function doesn't cross zero again. Wait, but how do we ensure that for x <2, the function doesn't cross zero again? Wait, at x approaching negative infinity, f(x) approaches 0 from positive. At x=0, f(x)=1>0. At x=1.3, it's 2.13>0, then decreases to 0 at x=2. So from x= -infty to x=2, the function is always positive except at x=2 where it's zero, and then becomes negative beyond x=2. Hence, x=2 is the only real solution.\n\nAlternatively, divide both sides by 5^x: (3/5)^x + (4/5)^x =1. Let’s define g(x) = (3/5)^x + (4/5)^x. We need to show g(x) =1 has only x=2 as solution. Since 3/5 and 4/5 are both less than 1, their exponentials are decreasing functions. So (3/5)^x is decreasing, (4/5)^x is decreasing, so sum is decreasing. Hence, g(x) is strictly decreasing. If that's the case, then it can cross 1 only once. Wait, but wait, 3/5 and 4/5 are both less than 1, so as x increases, (3/5)^x and (4/5)^x decrease. Therefore, their sum would decrease as x increases. Hence, if the function g(x) is strictly decreasing, then it can only cross the line y=1 once. Therefore, x=2 is the unique solution. But wait, is that true?\n\nWait, if x decreases, then (3/5)^x and (4/5)^x increase, so g(x) increases as x decreases. So when x approaches -infty, (3/5)^x and (4/5)^x go to infinity, so g(x) approaches infinity. At x=0, g(0)=1+1=2. At x=2, g(2)= (9/25)+(16/25)=1. As x increases beyond 2, g(x) continues to decrease towards zero. So since g(x) is strictly decreasing from infinity to 0, crossing y=1 exactly once at x=2. Therefore, there's only one solution. This approach seems better because if we can show g(x) is strictly decreasing, then uniqueness follows immediately.\n\nTherefore, the key is to show that g(x) is strictly decreasing. The derivative of g(x) would be ln(3/5)*(3/5)^x + ln(4/5)*(4/5)^x. Since ln(3/5) and ln(4/5) are both negative, and (3/5)^x and (4/5)^x are positive, so the derivative is negative. Therefore, g(x) is strictly decreasing. Hence, there's exactly one real solution x=2. \n\nThis seems like a solid proof. So the formatted problem should include the assumptions properly. Let me check the original problem again. The problem states that x is a real number. So the assumption is x ∈ ℝ, and we need to list each assumption line by line. The problem is to prove x=2 is the unique solution.",
