    "AcceptedAnswer": "Suppose $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sin(n^m) = L \\in [-1;1]$. Let $k \\ge 3$ be an odd integer.\nSince $(\\sin((kn)^m))$ is a subsequence of $(\\sin(n^m))$, it also converges to $L$. But we have a relation $\\sin(k^m x) = P_k(\\sin x)$ where $P_k$ is some polynomial. Hence $(\\sin((kn)^m) = P_k(\\sin(n^m)) \\to P_k(L)$, and so, $P_k(L) = L$. Moreover, for any $n_0$, the sequence $u_n = \\sin(k^{nm}n_0)$, which can be recursively defined by $u_0 = \\sin(n_0)$ and $u_{n+1} = P_k(u_n)$, has to converge to $L$. So not only is $L$ a fixed point of $P_k$, it probably should be an attractive fixed point too. First, we look at what can possibly be a fixpoint of all those $P_k$. We know $L = \\sin(l)$ for some $l$ satisfying $\\sin(k^ml) = \\sin(l)$.\nBut \n$\\sin(k^ml) = \\sin(l) \\iff k^ml \\equiv l \\pmod {2\\pi} \\text{ or } k^ml + l \\equiv \\pi \\pmod {2\\pi} \\\\\n\\iff l = 2a\\pi/(k^m-1) \\text{ or } l = (2b+1)\\pi/(k^m+1)$. In any case, $l$ must be a rational multiple of $\\pi$ : $l = a\\pi/b$ for some coprime integers $a$ and $b$ where $b$ divides $k^{2m}-1$. Suppose $p$ is an odd prime dividing $b$. Then, picking $k=p$, $p$ has to divide $p^{2m}-1$, which is obviously impossible. So $b$ must be a power of $2$. We can do a similar thing with $(\\sin(2^mx))^2 = P((\\sin x)^2)$ where $P$ is some polynomial, to show that $\\sin(2^ml) = \\pm \\sin(l)$, which implies $(2^m\\pm 1)l \\equiv 0 \\pmod \\pi$, and in any case, $b$ has to divide $2^{2m}-1$, which is odd. Hence $b=1$ and so we must have $L = 0$. Now, differentiating $\\sin(k^mx) = P_k(\\sin x)$ at $0$, we get $P'_k(0) = k^m > 1$. So $0$ is a repulsive fixpoint for every $P_k$ : there is a small interval around $0$ where $P_3$ pushes away from $0$ : if $\\sin(n^m)$ is small but nonzero, then $\\sin((3n)^m) = P_3(\\sin(n^m))$ will be further from $0$ than $\\sin((3n)^m)$, until it is pushed out of that interval. So there is no way that the sequence converges to $0$, unless $\\sin(n^m) = 0$ for all large enough $n$. But since $\\pi$ is irrational, this doesn't happen. This is all complicated and all, what with having to consider every $P_k$ to rule out the sequence converging anywhere. If you think about it, when we are at some $\\sin(l)$ away from $0$, we found a $k_l$ such that $P_{k_l}(\\sin(l)) \\neq \\sin(l)$ : there actually is some open interval $I_l$ containing $\\sin(l)$ on which we can see that $P_{k_l}(I_l) \\cap I_l = \\emptyset$ . If the sequence ever visits $I_l$, then we know for sure that it will leave it since it will have to visit $P_{k_l}(I_l)$. Similarly, we know there exists a small interval $I_0$ around $0$ such that $P_3$ acts like multiplication by $3^m$ and eventually sends anything nonzero away from $0$ (though the greater $m$ is, the smaller $I_0$ is) Since $[-1;1]$ is compact, if you consider a concrete $m$, you can use only a finite number of those intervals to obtain a very explicit argument going like this : $[-1;1]$ is the reunion of some explicit intervals $I_0,I_1,I_2, \\ldots, I_q$, where $0 \\in I_0$, and where for each $i > 0$ there is an odd integer $k_i$ such that $P_{k_i}(I_i) \\cap I_i = \\emptyset$, which prevents the sequence from converging inside any of those $I_i$. And $P_3$ prevents the sequence from converging in $I_0$ unless it is exactly $0$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to read the original problem carefully and filter out any unrelated information. \n\nThe original title is \"How prove this $\\lim_{n\\to \\infty}\\sin{n^m}$ divergent.\" The question states that they want to show the limit is divergent and dense in $[-1,1]$ where $m$ is a positive integer. They mention knowing that $\\sin{n^2}$ is divergent and dense, and reference some AMM problems, including an open problem about $\\sin{n^{14}}$. The user guesses that $\\sin{n^m}$ is dense in $[-1,1]$.\n\nNow, following the example provided, I need to list the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then state the problem clearly.\n\nFirst, the problem is about the limit of $\\sin{n^m}$ as $n$ approaches infinity. The key assumptions here are that $m$ is a positive integer. The original problem mentions $m \\in \\mathbb{N}^{+}$, which translates to $m$ being a positive integer. The example given in the user's example includes conditions like \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". Here, the variable in question is $m$, not $n$, so the assumption should be about $m$.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the limit is as $n$ approaches infinity, so $n$ is the variable tending to infinity, and $m$ is a fixed positive integer. Therefore, the assumption is that $m$ is a positive integer. The problem is to show that the limit is divergent (i.e., does not converge) and that the sequence is dense in $[-1,1]$. However, in the example provided, the assumption included the conditions on the variable (like $n$ being an integer and divisible by 7). But in this case, the variable $n$ is going to infinity, and $m$ is a parameter. \n\nWait, but in the original problem, they mention that the user has known that $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\sin{n^2}$ is divergent and dense. So in that case, $m=2$ is a specific case. The general problem is for any positive integer $m$. So the main assumption here is that $m$ is a positive integer. There's no restriction on $n$ except that it tends to infinity, so perhaps the only assumption is on $m$.\n\nBut in the example provided, the assumptions were about $n$, the variable in the expression. In this case, the variable is $n$, but the parameter is $m$. So maybe the assumptions should state that $m$ is a positive integer. The problem then is to prove that $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\sin{n^m}$ is divergent (and perhaps dense in $[-1,1]$). However, the original question's title says \"divergent\", but the body mentions dense in $[-1,1]$. So the problem is to show both that the limit doesn't exist (divergent) and that the sequence is dense in $[-1,1]$. However, in the example given, the problem was restated concisely. The user's example had an original problem which had extra info like references to AMM and open problems, but in the formatted version, they only kept the essential problem.\n\nSo in this case, the problem as structured should list the assumption that $m$ is a positive integer. The problem is to prove that $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\sin{n^m}$ is divergent (and possibly dense, but the title only says divergent). However, the user's original question mentions both divergent and dense. Let me check again.\n\nThe original question says: \"show that $$\\lim_{n\\to \\infty}\\sin{(n^m)}$$ divergent,where $m\\in N^{+}$ I have kown $$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\sin{n^2}$$ to be divergent and dense in $[-1,1]$.\" So the user wants to show two things: divergence of the limit and denseness in [-1,1]. But the problem statement in the formatted example only mentioned the divisibility by 91, even though the original problem had more context. However, in the example, the problem was restated as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" without mentioning the prior knowledge about AMM problems. So similarly, here, we should extract the core problem: showing that the limit is divergent (and dense), given that $m$ is a positive integer.\n\nBut wait, the example's formatted problem included two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem, the only condition was that n is an integer. Wait, the original problem was to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91, but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, that might have been an error. Wait, looking at the example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut that seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", which includes all integers, not just those divisible by 7. However, in the formatted problem, the user added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which was not in the original problem. That seems like a mistake. Wait, perhaps the example was incorrect. Wait, maybe I need to check again.\n\nWait, the user's example says:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, it's for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, they added the assumption that n is divisible by 7, which is not in the original. This seems contradictory. Maybe there was a misunderstanding. Perhaps the user intended to have a different example. Alternatively, maybe in the original problem, there was a missing condition, but the user structured it with an additional assumption. That might be an error. But regardless, perhaps the user's instruction is to list all assumptions from the problem. So in the current problem, the user states that $m$ is a positive integer. The problem is to show that the limit is divergent. But the user also mentions that they know it's true for m=2, and they guess it's dense in [-1,1]. So the problem as posed is to show that the limit is divergent (i.e., does not exist) and that the sequence is dense in [-1,1], for any positive integer m.\n\nBut the title says \"divergent\", and the body mentions \"dense in [-1,1]\". So the core problem is to prove both divergence and density. However, in the example provided, the problem was rephrased concisely. So in the formatted problem, the assumptions would be that m is a positive integer, and the problem is to prove that the limit is divergent (and dense in [-1,1]). However, the example had two assumptions for two different properties. But here, the only assumption is that m is a positive integer. Wait, but perhaps there's more. Wait, the original problem doesn't state any assumptions other than m being a positive integer. So in the formatted problem, the assumption is just m ∈ N⁺. The problem is to show that the limit is divergent and dense. However, the example separated two assumptions even though they applied to the same object. So perhaps each assumption is a separate line. Here, only one assumption: m is a positive integer. The problem is to prove that the limit is divergent and the sequence is dense in [-1,1]. But the user's example included two assumptions for the same variable. Wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", so the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But that seems incorrect because the original problem's assumption was that n is any integer, but the formatted problem added an extra condition. Maybe that example was a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the example was for a different problem where the divisibility by 7 was part of the problem's conditions. Maybe the user made a mistake in their example. But regardless, following the user's instructions, I need to list the assumptions from the problem. In the current problem, the only explicit assumption is that m is a positive integer. Therefore, in the formatted problem:\n\nAssumption: m is a positive integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that the limit as n approaches infinity of sin(n^m) is divergent and that the sequence is dense in [-1, 1].\n\nHowever, the original problem mentions \"divergent\" in the title and \"dense in [-1,1]\" in the body. So perhaps the problem is to show that the limit is divergent (i.e., does not converge) and that the sequence is dense in [-1,1]. However, sometimes, a sequence being dense in [-1,1] implies that it does not converge, as it keeps oscillating between values. So maybe the problem is just to show that the limit is divergent (does not exist), and the denseness is a stronger statement. But the user's question says \"show that the limit is divergent and dense\". Therefore, the formatted problem should include both. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to show that the limit does not exist (divergent), and the denseness is part of the solution. However, the user's original problem states both. So the problem is to show both divergence and denseness. \n\nBut in the example, the problem was rephrased concisely. So perhaps the problem statement here would be:\n\nProblem: Prove that $$\\lim_{n\\to \\infty}\\sin{(n^m)}$$ is divergent and dense in $[-1,1]$.\n\nBut in the example, the problem was phrased as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\", so similarly here, we need to state the problem as proving the limit is divergent and dense. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: \n$m$ is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\lim_{n\\to \\infty}\\sin{(n^m)}$$ is divergent and dense in $[-1,1]$.\n\nYes, that seems correct. The assumptions are that m is a positive integer, and the problem is to prove divergence and density. The original problem's title mentions divergence, and the body mentions denseness. The example included the problem's core statement, filtering out references to AMM and open problems, so here we do the same. Therefore, this should be the formatted problem.",
