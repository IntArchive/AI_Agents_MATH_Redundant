    "AcceptedAnswer": "In general, for $A:H\\longrightarrow H$ bounded linear operator on a Hilbert space $H$, $A\\geq 0$ implies $A^*=A$. Where $A\\geq 0$ means $(Ax,x)\\geq 0$ for every $x\\in H$. Note that we could more generally simply assume that $(Ax,x)\\in \\mathbb{R}$ for every $x$ in $H$. By assumption, $(Ax,x)\\in\\mathbb{R}$ whence\n$$\n(Ax,x)=\\overline{(Ax,x)}=(x,Ax)=(A^*x,x)\\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad ((A-A^*)x,x)=0\\quad \\forall x\\in  H.\n$$ So it boils down to the following key property, which is false in the real case. Fact: if $T$ is a (not necessarily bounded) linear operator on a complex Hilbert space $H$ such that $(Tx,x)=0$ for every $x\\in H$, then $T=0$. Proof: the usual polarization tricks, assuming semi-linearity in the first variable. With $x+y$, we get\n$$\n0=(T(x+y),x+y)=(Tx,y)+(Ty,x).\n$$\nAnd with $x+iy$, \n$$\n0=(T(x+iy),x+iy)=i(Tx,y)-i(Ty,x).\n$$\nIt follows that $(Tx,y)=0$ for every $x,y$, whence $Tx=0$ for every $x$. $\\Box$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let's tackle this problem. So, the user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then, the problem statement itself.\n\nLooking at the original question: \"Proof Complex positive definite => self-adjoint. I am looking for a proof of the theorem that says: A is a complex positive definite endomorphism and therefore is A self-adjoint. Does anybody of you know how to do this?\"\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The problem states that A is a complex positive definite endomorphism. So, the assumptions here are about the properties of A. Let me parse that.\n\nThe key terms are \"complex positive definite\" and \"endomorphism\". The conclusion is that A is self-adjoint. Now, in linear algebra, an endomorphism is a linear map from a vector space to itself. When dealing with inner product spaces, a positive definite operator typically satisfies ⟨Av, v⟩ > 0 for all non-zero vectors v. However, in the complex case, positive definiteness might have additional implications compared to the real case.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"complex positive definite endomorphism\". So, the setting is a complex vector space with an inner product (probably a Hermitian inner product). Now, in such spaces, a positive definite operator is usually required to satisfy ⟨Av, v⟩ is real and positive for all non-zero v. Also, for an operator to be self-adjoint (i.e., A = A* where A* is the adjoint), it must satisfy ⟨Av, w⟩ = ⟨v, Aw⟩ for all vectors v, w.\n\nThe theorem seems to state that if a complex endomorphism is positive definite, then it must be self-adjoint. But wait, in complex spaces, isn't positive definiteness usually defined for self-adjoint operators already? Hmm. Maybe in some contexts, positive definiteness is defined without assuming self-adjointness, but in reality, the two properties are connected.\n\nWait, let me recall: In complex inner product spaces, if an operator A satisfies ⟨Av, v⟩ is real for all v, then A is necessarily self-adjoint. Because for complex spaces, the inner product is conjugate linear in the second argument. So, if ⟨Av, v⟩ is real for all v, then ⟨Av, v⟩ = ⟨v, Av⟩ (since the conjugate of a real number is itself), which implies that A is self-adjoint by polarization.\n\nBut the problem says \"complex positive definite endomorphism\". So positive definite here would mean that ⟨Av, v⟩ is positive real for all non-zero v. Therefore, the assumption is that A is an endomorphism (linear operator on a complex vector space) such that ⟨Av, v⟩ is positive for all non-zero v. The conclusion is that A is self-adjoint.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. A is an endomorphism on a complex inner product space.\n2. A is positive definite, i.e., ⟨Av, v⟩ > 0 for all non-zero vectors v.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption applied to the object A.\n\nSo, structuring this according to the given format:\n\nAssumption:\nA is an endomorphism on a complex inner product space,\nA is positive definite.\nProblem:\nProve that A is self-adjoint.\n\nWait, but in the example provided, the original problem had an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, no, let me check again.\n\nWait, the original problem in the example was: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\"\n\nThe formatted problem added an assumption: \"n is divisible by 7\". But that contradicts the original problem's \"for every integer n\". So that example might be a mistake. But the user is providing their own example, so perhaps they intended to filter out unrelated information, but in that case, adding an assumption that n is divisible by 7 changes the problem. Maybe it's a typo or misunderstanding. However, the user's instruction says \"filtered the unrelated information\", so maybe in that example, the user mistakenly added the divisibility by 7? But I should follow their instruction regardless.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user's example might not be the best, but I need to structure the given problem as per the example. So, the problem is \"A is a complex positive definite endomorphism, therefore A is self-adjoint.\"\n\nSo, the assumptions are:\n\n1. A is a complex endomorphism (i.e., a linear operator on a complex vector space).\n2. A is positive definite (i.e., ⟨Av, v⟩ > 0 for all non-zero v in the space).\n\nProblem: Prove that A is self-adjoint.\n\nBut in the example, they split each assumption into separate lines. So each assumption should be on a separate line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a complex endomorphism,\nA is positive definite.\n\nProblem:\nProve that A is self-adjoint.\n\nBut maybe the inner product space is part of the assumption. Wait, the term \"endomorphism\" implies that it's a linear map from a space to itself. So, perhaps the first assumption is that A is an endomorphism on a complex inner product space. But the problem statement might not mention the inner product space, so maybe we need to include that as part of the assumptions.\n\nIn the original question, the user wrote: \"A is a complex positive definite endomorphism and therefore is A self-adjoint.\" So \"complex positive definite endomorphism\" is the key. So in mathematical terms, the assumptions are:\n\n1. A is an endomorphism on a complex inner product space.\n2. A is positive definite, i.e., ⟨Av, v⟩ > 0 for all non-zero vectors v.\n\nHence, these are two separate assumptions. Then the problem is to prove A is self-adjoint.\n\nTherefore, formatted as:\n\nAssumption:\nA is an endomorphism on a complex inner product space,\nA is positive definite.\nProblem:\nProve that A is self-adjoint.\n\nThat seems correct.",
