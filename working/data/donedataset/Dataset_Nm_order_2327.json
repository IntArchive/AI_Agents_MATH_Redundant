Let $p : \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a polynomial in $n$ real variables, with real coefficients, and suppose that $p > 0$ on all of $\\mathbb{R}^n$.

Of course this is true when $n=1$ because in that case we have $\\lim_{x \\to \\pm \\infty} p(x) = +\\infty$, and so $1/p$ is actually bounded.  In higher dimensions this is more subtle: consider for example $p(x,y) = x^2 + (1-xy)^2$ which is strictly positive for all $x,y$, yet $1/p$ is unbounded: consider $p(1/y,y)$ as $y \\to \\infty$.  For this example, I can use some calculus to show that $1/p(\\mathbf{x}) \\le 1+\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|^2 \\le (1+\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|)^2$, so $1/p$ does have polynomial growth.

    "AcceptedAnswer": "Yes. By Stengle's Positivstellensatz , we can find polynomials $f_1$ and $f_2$, such that each of $f_1$ and $f_2$ can be written as sums of squares of polyomials, and $p f_1 = 1+f_2$.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The question is whether the reciprocal of a positive multivariate polynomial has polynomial growth. That is, if p is a polynomial in n real variables that's always positive, does 1/p grow at most polynomially? \n\nFirst, the example given for n=1 makes sense. A single-variable polynomial that's always positive must tend to infinity as x goes to ±∞, so 1/p would be bounded, hence trivially of polynomial growth. But in higher dimensions, things get trickier. The example p(x,y) = x² + (1 - xy)² is positive everywhere, but along the path x = 1/y, as y approaches infinity, p becomes 1/y² + (1 - 1)^2 = 1/y², so 1/p is y², which grows like x² + y² if you parameterize it. But the user claims that 1/p is bounded by 1 + ||x||², which is a quadratic polynomial. Wait, how did they get that bound?\n\nLet me check. If p(x,y) = x² + (1 - xy)², then maybe they used some inequality. Let's expand p: x² + 1 - 2xy + x²y². Hmm. Alternatively, maybe they noticed that for any x and y, either x is large or y is large, but I'm not sure. Maybe using the AM-GM inequality? Not sure. But in their example, they showed that even though 1/p can be unbounded, it's still bounded by a polynomial in ||x||. So even if there are paths where 1/p blows up, it doesn't grow faster than some polynomial.\n\nNow the general case: suppose p is a positive polynomial in n variables. The user wants to know if 1/p(x) ≤ C(1 + ||x||)^N for some constants C, N. \n\nI recall that in semi-algebraic geometry, such questions might be approached using the concept of semi-algebraic functions and their growth. But I'm not too familiar. Alternatively, maybe using the fact that p(x) can be bounded below by some polynomial in ||x||. \n\nWait, for the example p(x,y) = x² + (1 - xy)², if we set x = 1/y, then as y → ∞, x approaches 0, but p(x,y) = (1/y²) + (1 - 1)^2 = 1/y², so 1/p = y². So along that path, 1/p grows quadratically, which is polynomial. So in that case, even though 1/p is unbounded, it's polynomial growth. \n\nBut what's the general case? Suppose p is positive definite (positive everywhere), but not necessarily coercive. Wait, coercive means that p(x) → ∞ as ||x|| → ∞. For example, p(x,y) = x² + y² is coercive, but the given example p(x,y) = x² + (1 - xy)^2 is not coercive, because along x=1/y, as y→infty, p approaches zero. Wait, but in their example, they say p is strictly positive, so even though it approaches zero along some path, it never reaches zero. However, 1/p blows up along that path. But the user claims that in their example, 1/p can be bounded by 1 + ||x||². How?\n\nWait, maybe in their example, p(x,y) = x² + (1 - xy)^2. Let's try to find a lower bound for p(x,y). Let's see. For any x, y, perhaps we can relate p(x,y) to some expression involving ||(x,y)||. Let's denote ||(x,y)||² = x² + y². \n\nAlternatively, maybe use the inequality that (a + b)^2 ≤ 2(a² + b²). Let's see. Let me expand p(x,y):\n\np(x,y) = x² + (1 - xy)^2 = x² + 1 - 2xy + x²y².\n\nHmm. So x²y² is a term of degree 4. So maybe for large x and y, the x²y² term dominates. Wait, but if x and y are both large, but if xy is approximately 1, then x²y² is approximately 1, so the term x² + 1 - 2xy + 1 might be small. Wait, but in that case, if xy ≈ 1, then p(x,y) ≈ x² + (1 - 1)^2 = x², so if x is large, then p is large. Wait, but earlier when x = 1/y, then p(x,y) = 1/y² + (1 - 1)^2 = 1/y², which tends to zero as y tends to infinity. So along that path, p approaches zero, hence 1/p approaches infinity. But in their example, they found that 1/p(x,y) ≤ 1 + x² + y². How?\n\nWait, maybe use the inequality that for any real numbers a and b, (a - b)^2 ≥ 0, which gives a² + b² ≥ 2ab. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe consider that p(x,y) = x² + (1 - xy)^2. Let's see if we can bound this from below. Let's consider two cases: when |xy| ≤ 2 and when |xy| > 2.\n\nCase 1: |xy| ≤ 2. Then (1 - xy)^2 ≤ (1 + |xy|)^2 ≤ (1 + 2)^2 = 9. So p(x,y) = x² + (1 - xy)^2 ≥ x². But if |xy| ≤ 2, then |x| ≤ 2/|y| if y ≠ 0. Wait, maybe this is getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe use the inequality that for any real numbers, (1 - xy)^2 + x² ≥ something. Let me see:\n\nLet me write p(x,y) = x² + 1 - 2xy + x²y². Maybe complete the square in terms of x. Let's see:\n\np(x,y) = x²y² + x² - 2xy +1.\n\nFactor x² terms: x²(y² + 1) - 2xy +1.\n\nHmm, maybe complete the square in x. Let me treat this as a quadratic in x:\n\nLet’s write it as (y² + 1)x² - 2y x + 1. The minimum of this quadratic in x is at x = [2y]/[2(y² +1)] = y/(y² +1). Plugging back in:\n\nMinimum value = 1 - [ (2y)^2 ] / [4(y² +1) ] = 1 - y²/(y² +1) = 1/(y² +1).\n\nSo the minimum value of p(x,y) for fixed y is 1/(y² +1). Thus, 1/p(x,y) ≤ y² +1. But also, since p(x,y) ≥ x² (from the first term), so 1/p(x,y) ≤ 1/x². But combining these two, perhaps 1/p(x,y) ≤ (1 + y²) + (1 + x²). Wait, but how to combine them.\n\nAlternatively, since the minimum over x for fixed y is 1/(y² +1), so 1/p(x,y) ≤ max(1/x², y² +1). But then, if x is large, 1/x² is small, but if y is large, then y² +1 is large. Hmm, but the user's example claims that 1/p(x,y) ≤ 1 + x² + y². Wait, maybe using that 1/p(x,y) ≤ y² +1 (from the minimum in x) and also 1/p(x,y) ≤ 1/x². But how to combine these. If y² +1 ≤ 1 + x² + y², which is always true. Similarly, 1/x² ≤ 1 + x² + y². Because if x is large, 1/x² ≤ x² ≤ x² + y² +1. If x is small, say |x| ≤1, then 1/x² could be large, but if x is near zero, then y must be large in order for xy ≈1 (as in the path x=1/y). Wait, but when x is small, say |x| ≤1, then p(x,y) = x² + (1 - xy)^2 ≥ x² ≥ 0, but since p is always positive, maybe even when x is small, (1 - xy)^2 is large unless xy is near 1. \n\nThis is getting a bit tangled. Let's see the user's claim: they say that 1/p(x,y) ≤ 1 + ||x||². For their example, ||x||² is x² + y². So 1 + x² + y². If they can show that p(x,y) ≥ 1/(1 + x² + y²), then reciprocal would be ≤ 1 + x² + y². But how? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the inequality that for any real numbers a and b, a² + b² ≥ (a + b)/2 or something else. Not sure. Maybe use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Wait, but I'm not seeing it immediately. Let's try to see for their example. If we can show that p(x,y) ≥ 1/(1 + x² + y²). Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps use homogenization. Since p is a degree 4 polynomial, and 1 + x² + y² is degree 2. So maybe for large ||x||, p(x,y) is comparable to x²y², and 1/p would be 1/(x²y²). But x²y² is part of ||x||^4, so 1/p is 1/||x||^4, which would be bounded by ||x||^4, but the user claims a quadratic bound. Hmm, maybe their example isn't the best, but they found a way to bound it quadratically. \n\nIn any case, the key point is that even though 1/p can be unbounded, its growth is at most polynomial. The user wants to know if this is always true for any positive polynomial p in n variables. \n\nI recall that there's a theorem in real algebraic geometry called the \"growth theorem\" or something similar, which states that if a function is semi-algebraic and bounded by a polynomial, then its reciprocal (if non-vanishing) also has polynomial growth. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe using the Tarski-Seidenberg theorem, which says that semi-algebraic sets are preserved under projections. But I don't see the direct connection. \n\nAnother approach: since p is a polynomial, positive everywhere, then by Hilbert's 17th problem, p can be written as a sum of squares of rational functions. But I'm not sure if that helps here. Alternatively, consider that p(x) tends to infinity as ||x|| tends to infinity, but the example shows that this isn't necessarily true. Wait, the example p(x,y) = x² + (1 - xy)^2 doesn't tend to infinity along all paths. For instance, along x=1/y, as y→infty, p tends to zero. So p is not coercive. \n\nBut the problem states that p is positive everywhere, not necessarily coercive. So the question is: even if p approaches zero along some path at infinity, does 1/p(x) grow at most polynomially? \n\nIn the example, they showed that even though p can approach zero, 1/p doesn't grow faster than a polynomial. The user wants to know if this is always true. \n\nMaybe we can use the fact that p is a polynomial, so its zero set is algebraic. But p is positive everywhere, so it has no real zeros. But how does that help? \n\nPerhaps consider the growth rate of 1/p. If p(x) can be bounded below by 1/(1 + ||x||)^N for some N, then 1/p(x) ≤ (1 + ||x||)^N. So the question reduces to: can a positive polynomial p(x) on R^n be bounded below by 1/(1 + ||x||)^N for some N? \n\nBut is this true? For example, take p(x,y) = x² + (1 - xy)^2. Is there an N such that p(x,y) ≥ 1/(1 + x² + y²)^N? Let's see. For large ||x||, say along the path x=1/y, p(x,y) = 1/y², and 1/(1 + x² + y²)^N = 1/(1 + 1/y² + y²)^N ≈ 1/y^{2N}. So we need 1/y² ≥ 1/y^{2N} for large y. This would require 2 ≤ 2N, i.e., N ≥1. But then, along other paths, say y=0, p(x,0) = x² +1, so 1/p = 1/(x² +1) ≤1. So for N=1, p(x,y) ≥ 1/(1 + x² + y²) would mean that 1/p ≤ 1 + x² + y². But in the path x=1/y, p(x,y)=1/y², and 1/(1 + x² + y²) =1/(1 + 1/y² + y²) ≈1/y². So 1/y² ≤1/y², which holds asymptotically. Wait, so maybe p(x,y) ≥ 1/(1 + x² + y²) for all x,y. Is that true?\n\nWait, let's check for x=1/y, y large. p(x,y)=1/y², and 1/(1 + x² + y²)=1/(1 +1/y² + y²)≈1/y². So 1/y² ≥1/y². They are equal asymptotically. So perhaps equality holds. But what about other points? For example, take x=0, y=1: p(0,1)=0 + (1 -0)^2=1. 1/(1 +0 +1)=1/2. So p=1 ≥1/2, which holds. Another point: x=1, y=1: p=1 + (1 -1)^2=1. 1/(1 +1 +1)=1/3. So 1≥1/3, holds. What about x=2, y=0: p=4 +1=5. 1/(1 +4 +0)=1/5. So 5≥1/5, yes. How about x=1, y=2: p=1 + (1 -2)^2=1 +1=2. 1/(1 +1 +4)=1/6. 2≥1/6, yes. Seems like p(x,y) ≥1/(1 +x² + y²) in this case. So then 1/p ≤1 +x² + y². So the user's example does satisfy this. But is this a general phenomenon?\n\nIf for any positive polynomial p on R^n, there exists N such that p(x) ≥1/(1 + ||x||)^N, then 1/p(x) ≤ (1 + ||x||)^N, which would answer the question affirmatively. But is this true? \n\nAlternatively, suppose p is positive definite (positive everywhere), then there exists constants c, N such that p(x) ≥c/(1 + ||x||)^N. If such c and N exist, then 1/p(x) ≤ (1/c)(1 + ||x||)^N. \n\nBut does this hold for all positive polynomials? The example suggests that at least in some cases, yes. But what about a polynomial like p(x,y) = (x^2 +1)(y^2 +1). This is positive everywhere. Then 1/p =1/(x²+1)(y²+1) ≤1, which is bounded. So here, 1/p is bounded, hence polynomial growth. \n\nAnother example: take p(x,y) =x^4 + y^4 +1. Then 1/p ≤1, since p≥1. \n\nBut consider a more complicated example. Suppose p(x,y) = (xy -1)^2 +1. This is always at least 1, so 1/p ≤1. But wait, p(x,y)= (xy -1)^2 +1 ≥1, so reciprocal is bounded. \n\nWait, but in the user's example, p can get arbitrarily close to zero. So maybe the key is whether the infimum of p(x) as ||x||→infty is zero. If p is coercive, then p(x)→infty as ||x||→infty, so 1/p is bounded. But if p is not coercive, there are paths to infinity where p approaches zero, hence 1/p approaches infinity. The question is whether this approach to infinity is at most polynomial. \n\nSo maybe in general, for any positive polynomial p, there exists N such that 1/p(x) ≤ C(1 + ||x||)^N. \n\nI recall a result called the \"Łojasiewicz inequality\", which states that for a real analytic function f, non-vanishing on a compact set, there are constants C and θ such that |f(x)| ≥ C d(x, f^{-1}(0))^θ. But in our case, f = p, which is positive everywhere, so f^{-1}(0) is empty. Wait, but the Łojasiewicz inequality might not directly apply here. \n\nAlternatively, there's a result in the paper by D'Acunto and Kurdyka: \"Explicit bounds for the Łojasiewicz exponent in the gradient inequality\", which might relate. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, consider that p(x) is a positive polynomial, so by the Positivstellensatz, there exists some sum of squares polynomial q(x) such that p(x)q(x) =1 + sum of squares. But I don't know. \n\nWait, another approach: since p is positive definite, it's bounded below by some positive constant on compact sets. So the only concern is the behavior at infinity. We need to show that at infinity, 1/p doesn't grow faster than polynomially. \n\nSuppose we can show that for large enough ||x||, p(x) ≥1/||x||^k for some k. Then 1/p(x) ≤ ||x||^k. \n\nBut how to establish such a bound? \n\nLet’s consider the homogenization of p. Let p be a polynomial of degree d. We can write p(x) = p_d(x) + lower degree terms, where p_d is the homogeneous part of degree d. \n\nIf p_d(x) is positive definite (i.e., positive for all x ≠0), then for large ||x||, p(x) behaves like p_d(x), which is homogeneous of degree d. So p_d(x) ≥ c||x||^d for some c>0, hence p(x) ≥ (c/2)||x||^d for large ||x||. Therefore, 1/p(x) ≤ (2/c)||x||^{-d}, which tends to zero, hence bounded. So in this case, 1/p is bounded. \n\nBut the problem arises when p_d(x) is not positive definite. For example, in the user's example, p(x,y) =x² + (1 -xy)^2, the homogeneous part of highest degree is x²y² (from expanding (1 -xy)^2), which is x²y². But x²y² is not positive definite; it's zero when x=0 or y=0. Hence, the homogeneous part of highest degree (degree 4) is x²y², which is not positive definite. Therefore, along paths where x or y is zero, the lower degree terms dominate. \n\nIn such cases, the behavior at infinity is more complicated. The user's example shows that even if the highest degree term is not positive definite, the polynomial can still be positive definite, but with the reciprocal having polynomial growth. \n\nSo maybe we need to use induction on the number of variables or some kind of recursive bound. Alternatively, use the fact that the set where p(x) < ε is semi-algebraic, and use bounds on the distance to this set. \n\nAlternatively, consider that for each ε >0, the set {x | p(x) ≤ ε} is compact. But if p is not coercive, this set might not be compact. Wait, but if p is positive everywhere, then for any ε>0, the set {x | p(x) ≤ ε} is closed (since p is continuous), but it might be unbounded. For example, in the user's example, as ε approaches zero, the set {x | p(x) ≤ ε} approaches the path x=1/y, y→infty, which is unbounded. \n\nSo if we can show that the distance from the origin to points in {x | p(x) ≤ ε} is bounded by some polynomial in 1/ε, then we might get a bound on 1/p(x) in terms of ||x||. \n\nThis is similar to the notion of \"polynomial growth at infinity\" for the sublevel sets. \n\nAlternatively, consider that since p is a polynomial, there exists a constant C and integer k such that p(x) ≥C/(1 + ||x||)^k for all x. If such C and k exist, then 1/p(x) ≤ (1/C)(1 + ||x||)^k. \n\nBut how to prove this? \n\nI recall a result from the paper \"Sharp estimates for the Artin-Hadamard functions\" by K. Kurdyka and S. Spodzieja, which might relate, but I'm not certain. \n\nAlternatively, consider using quantifier elimination. Since p is positive definite, the statement ∀x, p(x) >0 is true. By Tarski's theorem, this can be expressed in the first-order theory of real closed fields. But I don't know how to extract a bound from that. \n\nAnother idea: use the fact that p(x) can be written in terms of sums of squares, but not necessarily. However, if p is positive definite, it's not necessarily a sum of squares, but there might be a denominator. \n\nWait, coming back to the example. In their example, they used calculus to show the bound. Maybe in general, we can use optimization: for each x, find the minimal value of p(x) in terms of ||x||. But that seems difficult. \n\nAlternatively, use the fact that the function f(x) =1/p(x) is semi-algebraic (since p is a polynomial, and semi-algebraic functions are closed under reciprocals). Semi-algebraic functions have polynomial growth at infinity. There's a theorem stating that a semi-algebraic function f satisfies |f(x)| ≤ C(1 + ||x||)^k for some C, k. Hence, 1/p(x) being semi-algebraic would have polynomial growth. \n\nWait, this seems promising. Since p is a polynomial, 1/p is semi-algebraic (as the reciprocal of a polynomial, which is semi-algebraic). Then, by the growth lemma for semi-algebraic functions, which states that any semi-algebraic function f: R^n → R satisfies |f(x)| ≤ C(1 + ||x||)^k for some constants C, k. \n\nIs this a known result? Yes, I think so. For example, in the book \"Geometric Differentiability and the Łojasiewicz Inequalities\" or in the paper \"Semi-algebraic functions have subanalytic graphs\" by Bierstone and Milman. But the key point is that semi-algebraic functions have polynomial growth. \n\nTherefore, since 1/p is semi-algebraic and everywhere defined (because p is positive), it must have polynomial growth. Hence, the answer to the problem is yes: there exist constants C, N such that 1/p(x) ≤ C(1 + ||x||)^N. \n\nThis would be a high-level reason based on the properties of semi-algebraic functions. Therefore, the answer is yes, and the assumptions are that p is a polynomial in n real variables, p is positive everywhere, and the problem is to show that 1/p has polynomial growth.",
