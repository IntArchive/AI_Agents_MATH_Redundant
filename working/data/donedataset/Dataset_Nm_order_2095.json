    "Content": "This question is based on the following from Elements of Integration and Lebesgue Measure by Bartle. We are given the following example and exercise: Let X be the set ${\\mathbf R}$ of real numbers. The Borel algebra is the $\\sigma$-algebra generated by all open intervals $(a,b)$ in ${\\mathbf R}$. Observe that the Borel algebra ${\\mathbf B}$ is also the $\\sigma$-algebra generated by all closed intervals $[a,b]$ in ${\\mathbf R}$ Exercise 2.B. Show that the Borel algebra ${\\mathbf B}$ is also generated by the collection of all half-open intervals $(a,b]=\\{x\\in {\\mathbf R}: a<x\\leqslant b\\}$ The definition of sigma algebras we are given is that they are unions and complements of a family of sets on a universal set $X$. My thought on the way to solve this was to use something like\n$$\n(a,b)=\\cup_{n=1}^\\infty[a+1/n,b-1/n]\n$$\nand similarly\n$$\n(a,b)=\\cup_{n=1}^\\infty(a,b-1/n]\n$$\nto show that we can construct $(a,b)$ as a union of either the closed or the half-open intervals. What I'm wondering about is, first I would like to check that the above is a correct answer of course, and also I wonder whether I've missed some other trick which doesn't involve these constructions.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Yes, you have the right idea. But the solution you gave is not complete. Let $\\mathfrak{B}$ be the Borel set generated by intervals of the form $[a,b]$ and  $\\mathfrak{B}^*$ be the Borel set generated by elements of the form $(a,b)$ By the relation you gave, $$(a,b)=\\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty [a+1/n,b-1/n]$$ You showed that any open interval $(a,b)$ can be written as a countable union of closed sets. Hence, $(a,b)\\in \\mathfrak{B}$ Now since each element of $\\mathfrak{B}^*$ is a countable union, intersection and complement of open intervals. Thus you have $$\\mathfrak{B}^*\\subseteq\\mathfrak{B}$$ Now, you also need to show $\\mathfrak{B}\\subseteq\\mathfrak{B}^*$. I'm sure, since you have the right idea, that you'll be able to show that too.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The question is to show that the Borel algebra B on the real numbers is generated by the collection of all half-open intervals (a, b]. \n\nFirst, I remember that the Borel σ-algebra is typically defined as the σ-algebra generated by all open sets in ℝ. But in the problem statement, it's mentioned that the Borel algebra is generated by all open intervals (a, b) and also by all closed intervals [a, b]. So the task is to show that the same σ-algebra can be generated by the half-open intervals (a, b].\n\nThe user suggested using expressions like (a, b) = union from n=1 to infinity of (a, b - 1/n]. That makes sense because as n increases, b - 1/n approaches b from below, so the union of all these half-open intervals would cover up to but not including b, effectively creating an open interval (a, b). Similarly, they mentioned constructing open intervals as unions of closed intervals, like [a + 1/n, b - 1/n], which would approach (a, b) as n grows.\n\nWait, but the problem is about generating the Borel algebra using half-open intervals. So the strategy would be to show that every open interval can be written as a countable union of half-open intervals, thereby proving that the σ-algebra generated by half-open intervals contains all open intervals. Since the Borel algebra is the smallest σ-algebra containing open intervals, then the σ-algebra generated by half-open intervals must be at least as large as the Borel algebra. Conversely, since all half-open intervals are Borel sets (as they can be expressed as the intersection of an open interval (a, b) and a closed interval (-∞, b]), the σ-algebra generated by half-open intervals is contained within the Borel algebra. Hence, they must be equal.\n\nLet me verify this approach. If I can express open intervals as countable unions of half-open intervals, then the σ-algebra generated by half-open intervals would include all open intervals. Therefore, the generated σ-algebra must include the entire Borel algebra. Conversely, since each half-open interval is a Borel set (because, for example, (a, b] can be written as (a, b) ∪ {b}, and both open intervals and single points are Borel), the σ-algebra generated by half-open intervals is a subset of the Borel algebra. Thus, equality holds.\n\nAnother way to think about it: σ-algebras are closed under countable unions, intersections, and complements. So if we can generate open intervals from half-open ones via countable operations, then the σ-algebra from half-open intervals contains the open intervals, hence their σ-algebra is the Borel algebra.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user had an example where they wrote (a, b) as a union of [a + 1/n, b - 1/n]. But in this problem, we need to generate the Borel algebra from half-open intervals. So maybe we can express both open and closed intervals in terms of half-open ones, thereby showing that the σ-algebra generated by half-open intervals includes both open and closed intervals, hence it must be the same as the Borel algebra.\n\nAlternatively, consider that a half-open interval (a, b] can be expressed as the intersection of an open interval (a, b + ε) and a closed interval [a + ε, b], but I'm not sure if that's helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, since closed intervals [a, b] can be written as the intersection of half-open intervals (a - 1/n, b], as n approaches infinity. Similarly, open intervals (a, b) can be written as the union of half-open intervals (a, b - 1/n], as n increases. Therefore, both open and closed intervals can be obtained from countable operations on half-open intervals. Hence, the σ-algebra generated by half-open intervals contains all open and closed intervals, so it must contain the Borel algebra. Since each half-open interval is a Borel set, the σ-algebra generated by them is exactly the Borel algebra.\n\nSo the user's approach seems correct. They might have missed some other method, but the construction using countable unions seems valid. Perhaps another approach could use complements: since a half-open interval (a, b] can be written as (a, ∞) ∩ (-∞, b], but those are rays. However, rays can also generate the Borel algebra. Alternatively, maybe using that σ-algebras are closed under complements, so if you have half-open intervals, you can get their complements, which would be (-∞, a] ∪ (b, ∞), but I'm not sure if that's helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the π-λ theorem, showing that the collection of half-open intervals is a π-system generating the Borel σ-algebra. But perhaps that's overcomplicating.\n\nIn any case, the key idea is to show that open intervals are in the σ-algebra generated by half-open intervals, which the user's approach achieves by expressing (a, b) as a countable union of (a, b - 1/n]. Then since the generated σ-algebra includes all open intervals, it must contain the Borel algebra. Conversely, since half-open intervals are Borel, their σ-algebra is contained within B, hence they are equal.\n\nSo the answer seems correct. The user might have considered other methods, but the approach they took is valid. Maybe they were concerned about missing a step, but the logic holds. The key points are that open intervals can be constructed via countable unions of half-open intervals, and that half-open intervals are Borel sets. Therefore, the generated σ-algebras must coincide.",
