    "Content": "There is a theorem ： If $K \\in F$ and $F$ is a splitting field of a polynomial  in $K[x]$,then F is a normal extension over $K$. For proving this I choose a polynomial $g \\in K[x]$ which has a root in $F$ and I want to prove that g splits completely over $F$. In my textbook,the proof of this follows the existence of an algebraic closure，which seems like can not be proved without the using of zorn lemma. However the property I want to get  looks like have nothing to do with the set-theoretic difficulty. So is there any proof more direct？",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The argument doesn't actually require an algebraic closure; you can just replace the algebraic closure by sufficiently large finite extensions in each step of the argument. Specifically, say $F$ is the splitting field of $f$ over $K$ and let $L$ be an extension of $F$ over which $g$ splits.  Let $\\alpha\\in F$ be a root of $g$ and let $\\beta\\in L$ be another root of $g$; we wish to show $\\beta\\in F$.  There is an embedding $i:K(\\alpha)\\to L$ which fixes $K$ and sends $\\alpha$ to $\\beta$.  This embedding can then be extended to an embedding $j:F\\to L'$ for some finite extension $L'$ of $L$ (in fact, you can prove that you can take $L'=L$, but that is not needed for this argument).  But then both $j(F)$ and $F$ are splitting fields of $f$ over $K$ inside $L'$, so $j(F)=F$.  Since $j(\\alpha)=\\beta$, this implies $\\beta\\in F$, as desired. (In case you are skeptical of the existence of $L'$, here is the general lemma I am using.  If $i:k\\to L$ is a field embedding and $F$ is a finite extension of $k$, then there exists a finite extension $L'$ of $L$ and an embedding $j:F\\to L'$ extending $i$.  Indeed, $F$ is generated over $k$ by finitely many elements, and so by extending one element at a time, we may assume $F=k(a)$ for a single element $a$.  Now let $h$ be the minimal polynomial of $a$ over $k$ and let $L'$ be an extension of $L$ obtained by adjoining a root $b$ of the polynomial obtained by applying $i$ to all the coefficients of $h$.  There is then a unique extension of $i$ to an embedding $j:F\\to L'$ which sends $a$ to $b$.)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to help structure this problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. Let me read through the original question carefully.\n\nThe user is asking about proving that a splitting field is normal without using Zorn's Lemma. They mention a theorem stating that if F is a splitting field of a polynomial in K[x], then F is a normal extension over K. The textbook proof uses the existence of an algebraic closure, which relies on Zorn's Lemma, but the user wants a more direct proof avoiding set-theoretic complexities.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The theorem's assumptions are that K is a field, F is a splitting field of some polynomial in K[x], and the problem is to prove F is a normal extension over K without using Zorn's Lemma. Wait, the original problem states that the user wants to prove this normality without using Zorn's Lemma. The key assumptions here would be that F is a splitting field over K for a polynomial in K[x], and the goal is to show F is normal over K without invoking Zorn's Lemma.\n\nBut the example given in the prompt includes assumptions as separate points. So let's break it down. Each assumption should be a single condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption 1: K is a field.\nAssumption 2: F is a splitting field of a polynomial in K[x].\nProblem: Prove that F is a normal extension over K without using Zorn's Lemma.\n\nWait, but the original question's user is challenging the textbook's approach which uses algebraic closures (hence Zorn's Lemma). The user wants an alternative proof. But in structuring the problem, the assumptions would be the given conditions. The problem statement as per the user is about whether there's a proof that F is normal over K without Zorn's Lemma.\n\nBut in the example provided, the original problem's assumptions were listed, even if the user in that case had an extra condition. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no, looking back: the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem lists assumptions as n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that seems like a mistake, because the original problem didn't restrict n to be divisible by 7. Wait, perhaps that example was incorrect? Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the only assumption is that n is an integer. But in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" which wasn't in the original. That seems like an error in the example.\n\nBut perhaps the user made a mistake there. Anyway, back to the current problem. The user is stating the theorem: if K is in F (maybe a typo for K is a subfield of F?), and F is a splitting field of a polynomial in K[x], then F is a normal extension over K. The user wants to prove this without using Zorn's Lemma. The problem is to prove that F is a normal extension over K given that F is a splitting field for a polynomial in K[x], but without using Zorn's Lemma.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- K is a field.\n\n- F is an extension field of K.\n\n- F is the splitting field of a polynomial in K[x].\n\nThen the problem is to prove that F is a normal extension over K without using Zorn's Lemma.\n\nWait, but the original theorem's statement is \"If K ∈ F and F is a splitting field...\". Maybe \"K ∈ F\" is a typo or mistranslation. Probably should be \"K is a subfield of F\", i.e., F is an extension field of K. So the assumptions are:\n\n1. F is an extension field of K.\n\n2. F is a splitting field of a polynomial in K[x].\n\nProblem: Prove that F is a normal extension over K without using Zorn's Lemma.\n\nBut in the example, assumptions are listed as individual points. So each bullet point is a separate assumption.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- F is an extension field of K,\n\n- F is the splitting field of a polynomial in K[x].\n\nProblem: Prove that F is a normal extension over K without using Zorn's Lemma.\n\nWait, but the user mentions in their question that the textbook uses the existence of an algebraic closure, which requires Zorn's Lemma. So the user is looking for a proof that avoids that. Therefore, the problem is to prove the theorem under the given assumptions without invoking Zorn's Lemma.\n\nTherefore, the key assumptions are F being a splitting field of a polynomial over K, and the problem is the proof of normality without Zorn's Lemma.\n\nSo I think that's the structure.",
