    "Content": "Our teacher gave us a hard question (according to her, it is pretty hard for our level): Given that $|z_1| = |z_2|= |z_3|=1,z \\in\\mathbb{C}$ , prove that $|z_1+z_2+z_3| = \\left|\\frac{1}{z_1}+\\frac{1}{z_2}+\\frac{1}{z_3}\\right|$ . Now, the class tried for like 40 minutes to prove that, and then the teacher came up with some really complicated proof. I sat quietly and came up with this proof: $$|z_1+z_2+z_3| = |R(\\operatorname{cis}\\alpha + \\operatorname{cis}\\beta + \\operatorname{cis}\\gamma)| = I$$ Thus $$|I| = R\\tag{1}$$ Also, $$\\left|\\frac{1}{z_1}+\\frac{1}{z_2}+\\frac{1}{z_3}\\right|=\\left|\\frac{1}{R}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\operatorname{cis}\\alpha}+\\frac{1}{\\operatorname{cis}\\beta}+\\frac{1}{\\operatorname{cis}\\gamma}\\right)\\right| = T$$ Thus $$|T| = \\frac{1}{R} \\tag{2}$$ It's easy to see that from $(1)$ and $(2)$ we get: $$R=\\frac{1}{R}$$ Thus $$\\frac{1}{1} = 1$$ Which finish the proof. My teacher said that there is a mistake in my proof, but found none - she said it could not be that easy. Is there an error in my proof? Or is it valid?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The following is a fairly easy proof. Since $z_1,z_2,z_3$ are on the unit circle, we have:$$\\frac{1}{z_i}=\\overline{z_i}\\qquad i=1,2,3.$$ Hence,$$\\left|\\frac{1}{z_1}+\\frac{1}{z_2}+\\frac{1}{z_3}\\right|=\\left|\\overline{z_1}+\\overline{z_2}+\\overline{z_3}\\right|=|\\overline{z_1+z_2+z_3}|=|z_1+z_2+z_3|.$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's take a look at this problem. The user is supposed to prove that for three complex numbers z₁, z₂, z₃ each with modulus 1, the absolute value of their sum is equal to the absolute value of the sum of their reciprocals. The student provided a proof, but the teacher says there's a mistake even though they couldn't find it. Let me break down the student's approach and see where they might have gone wrong.\n\nFirst, the problem states that |z₁| = |z₂| = |z₃| = 1. So each z_k is on the unit circle in the complex plane. The reciprocal of each z_k is just its complex conjugate because if |z| = 1, then 1/z = conjugate(z). Therefore, the sum of reciprocals is the same as the sum of the conjugates. The absolute value of a complex number and its conjugate are the same, so maybe there's a relationship between the sum of the z's and the sum of their conjugates.\n\nThe student starts by writing |z₁ + z₂ + z₃| as |R(cis α + cis β + cis γ)| and says that |I| = R. Wait, but R is introduced here without explanation. If z₁, z₂, z₃ each have modulus 1, then when you add them, the modulus of the sum could be between 0 and 3. But the student is representing each z as R times cis θ (which is R times e^(iθ)), but since |z| = 1, R should be 1. Maybe the student is using R as a scaling factor, but that's not necessary because each z_k already has modulus 1. So perhaps the mistake is in how R is introduced here. If R is supposed to be the modulus of each z_k, then R is 1, so writing z_k as R cis α would make sense, but then R is 1. The student then writes |I| = R, but if I is the sum of the three cis terms scaled by R, then the modulus would be |R| times |sum of cis terms|. Since R is 1, this would just be |sum of cis terms|. Then the student claims |I| = R, which would mean that the modulus of the sum is equal to R. But unless the sum is real and positive, the modulus isn't necessarily equal to R. So maybe the student is assuming that the sum has modulus R, which is 1, but that's only true if the angles α, β, γ are arranged such that the vectors cancel out except for a real component. But that's a specific case, not generally true. So perhaps the student incorrectly assumed that the modulus of the sum is R, which is 1, when in reality it could vary between 0 and 3.\n\nNext, the student considers the sum of reciprocals. Since each 1/z_k is the conjugate of z_k (because |z_k|=1), the sum of reciprocals is the conjugate of the sum of z_k's. Therefore, the modulus of the sum of reciprocals is the same as the modulus of the conjugate of the sum, which is the same as the modulus of the original sum. Therefore, |sum z_k| = |sum 1/z_k|. But the student's approach seems to involve writing the reciprocals as 1/(R cis α) which would be (1/R) cis(-α). But since R is 1, this is just cis(-α). So the sum of reciprocals would be the sum of cis(-α), cis(-β), cis(-γ), which is the conjugate of the original sum. Therefore, the modulus should be the same. The student's mistake might be in their step (2), where they write |T| = 1/R. If R is 1, then |T| would be |sum of cis(-α) + cis(-β) + cis(-γ)|, which is the same as |conj(sum z_k)| = |sum z_k|. So |T| = |sum z_k|, which is the same as |I|. But the student claims |T| = 1/R, which if R=1, then |T|=1. But unless the sum of the reciprocals has modulus 1, which isn't necessarily the case. So the student's error is assuming that |T| equals 1/R, which is 1, but actually |T| should equal |sum z_k|, so equating |I| = R and |T| = 1/R would lead to R = 1/R, hence R=1, but since R was already 1, this doesn't prove anything. The student's proof seems circular and incorrectly assumes that |I|=R and |T|=1/R, leading to R=1, but R was already 1. The actual proof should show that |sum z_k| = |sum conj(z_k)|, which are equal because modulus is invariant under conjugation. Therefore, the student's approach has a flaw in how they introduced R and handled the modulus of the sums.",
