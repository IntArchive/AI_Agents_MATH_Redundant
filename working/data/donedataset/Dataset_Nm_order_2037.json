    "Content": "Question: How to prove that $$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\sum_{k=0}^n\\frac{n^{2k}}{(k!)^2}\\Bigg/\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty\\frac{n^{2k}}{(k!)^2}=\\frac12?$$ ( $0^0$ is defined to be one).\n  In addition, can we calculate $$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\sqrt n\\left(\\sum_{k=0}^n\\frac{n^{2k}}{(k!)^2}\\Bigg/\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty\\frac{n^{2k}}{(k!)^2}-\\frac12\\right)?$$ Relating to this question , there seems to be two possible ways, one is using central limit theorem, the other one is to turn this sum into an integral and estimate it. Unfortunately, the first possible method cannot be applied because the random variable $X_n$ with $$P(X_n=x)=\\frac{n^{2x}}{(x!)^2}\\Bigg/\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty\\frac{n^{2k}}{(k!)^2}$$ does not have good properties like Poisson distribution. I'm able to calculate $\\mathrm E(X)$ and $\\mathrm{Var}(X)$ , which are $\\frac{I_1(2n)}{I_0(2n)}$ and $n^2\\left(1-\\frac{I_1(2n)}{I_0(2n)}\\right)$ respectively. CLT cannot be applied here. I'm not familiar with generalized CLT, so I'm hoping for an analytical method. Analytical Attempt Denote $\\sum_{k=0}^n\\frac{n^{2k}}{(k!)^2}\\big/\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty\\frac{n^{2k}}{(k!)^2}$ by $L_n$ . $$L_n=1-\\frac{n^{2n+2}{}_1F_2(1;n+2,n+2;n^2)}{((n+1)!)^2I_0(2n)}\\\\\n=1-\\left(\\frac1{\\sqrt{\\pi n}}+O(n^{-3/2})\\right){}_1F_2(1;n+2,n+2;n^2)$$ But we have $$_1F_2(\\cdots)=(n+1)\\int_0^1(1-t)^n{}_0F_1(2+n;n^2t)dt\\\\\n=e^{-n}\\sqrt{2\\pi n}(n+O(1))\\int_0^1t^{-(n+1)/2}(1-t)^nI_{n+1}(2n\\sqrt t)dt\\\\\n=e^{-n}\\sqrt{8\\pi n}(n+O(1))\\int_0^1t^{-n}(1-t^2)^nI_{n+1}(2nt)dt$$ Where all $I$ 's above denote Bessel I function. I think the asymptotic behavior of $I_n(z)$ when $n\\approx kz\\gg 0$ is needed, but I don't have reference of it.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here are two possible approaches: Method 1. Let $X_n$ be a random variable with $$ \\mathbb{P}(X_n = k) = \\frac{n^{2k}}{(k!)^2} \\bigg/\\biggl( \\sum_{l=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{n^{2l}}{(l!)^2} \\biggr), \\qquad k = 0, 1, 2, \\cdots. $$ Then the characteristic function of $X_n$ is given by $$ \\varphi_{X_n}(t) = \\mathbb{E}[e^{it X_n}] = \\frac{I_0(2n e^{it/2})}{I_0(2n)}, $$ where $I_0$ is the modified Bessel function of the first kind and order $0$ . Now we normalize $X_n$ as follows: $$ Z_n = \\frac{X_n - n}{\\sqrt{n}}. $$ Then by invoking the asymptotic formula for $I_0$ : $$ I_0(z) \\sim \\frac{e^{z}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi z}} \\qquad \\text{as} \\quad z \\to \\infty \\quad\\text{along}\\quad |\\arg(z)| \\leq \\frac{\\pi}{2}-\\delta, $$ for each fixed $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$ it follows that $$ \\varphi_{Z_n}(t)\n= e^{-it\\sqrt{n}} \\, \\frac{I_0(2n\\exp(it/2\\sqrt{n}))}{I_0(2n)}\n\\sim \\exp\\bigl( 2ne^{it/2\\sqrt{n}}-2n-it\\sqrt{n} \\bigr) \\qquad \\text{as} \\quad n\\to\\infty. $$ This shows that $$ \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\varphi_{Z_n}(t) = e^{-t^2/4}, $$ and so, $Z_n$ converges in distribution to $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\frac{1}{2})$ . Then the desired limit is $$ \\mathbb{P}(X_n \\leq n) = \\mathbb{P}(Z_n \\leq 0) \\xrightarrow[]{n\\to\\infty} \\mathbb{P}(Z \\leq 0) = \\frac{1}{2}. $$ The second question seems also interesting and I suspect that it may be related to the local CLT, although I have no good idea in this direction. Method 2. Here is a sketch of the proof using the Laplace's method : By approximating the sum by integral and invoking the Stirling's formula, for any fixed large $N_0$ and for any $N \\in \\{N_0+1, N_0+2, \\cdots\\} \\cup \\{+\\infty\\}$ , we expect: $$ \\sum_{n=N_0}^{N} \\frac{n^{2k}}{(k!)^2} \\approx \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{N_0}^{N} \\frac{n^{2x}}{x^{2x+1} e^{-2x}} \\, \\mathrm{d}x. $$ Now by writing $$ \\frac{n^{2x}}{x^{2x+1} e^{-2x}} = \\exp\\biggl( 2n - \\log n - \\frac{x-n}{n} - \\int_{n}^{x} (x - t)\\frac{2t-1}{t^2} \\, \\mathrm{d}t \\biggr) $$ and substituting $x = n+\\sqrt{n}z$ and $t = n+\\sqrt{n}u$ , we get $$ \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{N_0}^{N} \\frac{n^{2x}}{x^{2x+1} e^{-2x}} \\, \\mathrm{d}x\n= \\frac{e^{2n}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi n}} \\int_{\\frac{N_0-n}{\\sqrt{n}}}^{\\frac{N-n}{\\sqrt{n}}} \\exp\\biggl( -\\frac{z}{\\sqrt{n}} - \\int_{0}^{z} (z - u) \\frac{2 + \\frac{2u}{\\sqrt{n}}-\\frac{1}{n}}{\\bigl( 1 + \\frac{u}{\\sqrt{n}}\\bigr)^2} \\, \\mathrm{d}u \\biggr) \\, \\mathrm{d}z. $$ Then, as $n\\to\\infty$ , we expect this to become close to: $$ \\approx \\frac{e^{2n}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi n}} \\int_{\\frac{N_0-n}{\\sqrt{n}}}^{\\frac{N-n}{\\sqrt{n}}} \\exp\\biggl(  - \\int_{0}^{z} 2(z - u) \\, \\mathrm{d}u \\biggr) \\, \\mathrm{d}z\n= \\frac{e^{2n}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi n}} \\int_{\\frac{N_0-n}{\\sqrt{n}}}^{\\frac{N-n}{\\sqrt{n}}} e^{-z^2} \\, \\mathrm{d}z. $$ Applying this to $N = n$ and $N = +\\infty$ would then show that their ratio converges to $$ \\frac{\\int_{-\\infty}^{0} e^{-z^2} \\, \\mathrm{d}z}{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-z^2} \\, \\mathrm{d}z} = \\frac{1}{2}. $$ Addendum. For the second question, a numerical evidence suggests that $$ \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\sqrt{n}\\Biggl( \\frac{\\sum_{k=0}^{n} n^{2k}/(k!)^2}{\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} n^{2k}/(k!)^2} - \\frac{1}{2} \\Biggr) = \\frac{5}{6\\sqrt{\\pi}}. $$ However, I have no simple idea for proving this.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure with assumptions and the problem statement. First, I need to read through the original problem carefully and identify all the key elements.\n\nThe question is about proving a limit involving sums of terms with factorials and Bessel functions. The user also mentions an additional part about calculating another limit involving a square root and the difference from 1/2. There's some discussion about methods attempted, like using the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) and converting sums into integrals, but those methods didn't work out. They also mention properties of a random variable related to the problem, but since the focus is on formatting, I can ignore the solution attempts.\n\nThe task is to extract assumptions and restate the problem. The example given shows that assumptions are specific conditions or properties applied to one object each. In the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, which were split into two separate points.\n\nLooking at the current problem:\n\nThe limit is as n approaches infinity of the ratio of two sums: the sum from k=0 to n of n^{2k}/(k!)^2 divided by the sum from k=0 to infinity of the same term. The user also asks about a second limit involving sqrt(n) times the difference between the ratio and 1/2.\n\nAssumptions here might include:\n\n1. The variable n is a positive integer approaching infinity.\n2. The sums involve terms defined for all non-negative integers k.\n3. 0^0 is defined as 1 (as mentioned in the question).\n4. The denominator is the entire infinite series, which converges (since it's related to Bessel functions, I_0(2n) perhaps? The user mentions I_0 and I_1 Bessel functions in their attempt).\n\nBut wait, the problem states that 0^0 is defined as one, which is important for the k=0 term. So that's a key assumption. The problem is about the limit as n approaches infinity, so n is going to infinity. The sums are over k, with n as a parameter. The denominator is the infinite sum, which the user refers to using Bessel functions. However, in the problem statement itself, the user defines 0^0 = 1, which is necessary for when k=0 and n=0, but since n is going to infinity, maybe that's just part of the problem's definition.\n\nSo the assumptions should be:\n\n- For each non-negative integer k, the term in the sums is n^{2k}/(k!)^2.\n- 0^0 is defined as 1 (to handle the k=0 term when n=0, even though n approaches infinity, but the problem explicitly mentions this definition).\n- The denominator is the sum from k=0 to infinity of n^{2k}/(k!)^2, which converges (as it's related to the modified Bessel function of the first kind I_0(2n), but maybe that's part of the problem context, not an assumption).\n\nWait, the problem statement already includes the 0^0 definition. So when formatting, the assumptions should list that 0^0 is defined as 1. Also, the problem involves the limit as n approaches infinity. But in the example, the assumptions were about properties of n. However, in the original problem here, the question is about the limit as n approaches infinity, so n is a positive integer going to infinity. But maybe the key assumption here is that n is a positive integer approaching infinity? Or is that part of the problem's statement?\n\nThe problem is to prove the limit as n approaches infinity of the ratio equals 1/2. So the assumptions would include the definitions of the terms, the 0^0 definition, and maybe that the infinite sum converges (since it's divided by that sum). But perhaps the key assumptions are the definitions needed for the terms. Let me check the example again. In the example, the assumptions were \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". The original problem didn't state those, but the formatted problem included them. Wait, no. Wait, the original example had the problem saying \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption added that \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like a mistake. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem changed it to assume that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but the original problem didn't have the divisibility by 7. Wait, perhaps the example is incorrect? Because if the problem says \"for every integer n\", then the assumption should not add that n is divisible by 7 unless the user made a mistake. Wait, maybe the example was a mistake. But regardless, in our current problem, we need to list assumptions from the problem as given.\n\nThe original problem here says: \"How to prove that [the limit] = 1/2? (0^0 is defined to be one). In addition, can we calculate [another limit]?\" So the key given conditions are:\n\n- 0^0 is defined as 1.\n\nThat's an explicit assumption. The problem is about the limit as n approaches infinity. The other elements are part of the problem's setup, like the sums involved. So the assumptions should be:\n\n1. 0^0 is defined as 1.\n2. The sums are defined for all non-negative integers k.\n3. The denominator is the infinite series sum from k=0 to infinity of n^{2k}/(k!)^2.\n\nWait, but the denominator being the infinite sum is part of the problem statement. The problem is to take the ratio of the partial sum up to n divided by the infinite sum. So perhaps the assumptions are just the 0^0 definition, and that the terms are as defined. But the example had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". Maybe the example is wrong. But according to the user's instruction, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So for the current problem, the main assumption given is 0^0 is defined as 1. The rest is part of the problem's structure. Maybe the problem doesn't have other explicit assumptions, but let me check again.\n\nThe problem mentions \"the random variable X_n with P(X_n=x) = ... / sum_{k=0}^\\infty ...\", but that's part of the user's solution attempt, which we are instructed to ignore. The problem as stated in the title and the first line is the limit of the ratio as n approaches infinity. So the key assumptions would be:\n\n- 0^0 is defined as 1 (given in the problem).\n- The terms in the sums are defined as n^{2k}/(k!)^2 for non-negative integers k.\n- The denominator is the infinite sum which converges (this is necessary for the ratio to be defined, but maybe that's implied).\n\nHowever, the example included assumptions that were part of the problem's conditions, so perhaps here we need to list:\n\nAssumption:\n0^0 is defined as 1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\sum_{k=0}^n\\frac{n^{2k}}{(k!)^2}\\Bigg/\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty\\frac{n^{2k}}{(k!)^2}=\\frac12.$$\nAlso, calculate $$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\sqrt n\\left(\\sum_{k=0}^n\\frac{n^{2k}}{(k!)^2}\\Bigg/\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty\\frac{n^{2k}}{(k!)^2}-\\frac12\\right).$$\n\nWait, but the user's example split the problem into two parts. The original problem here has two separate limits to compute. However, in the problem formatting, the example only included the first problem. But the user's instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\" where the problem part can include multiple questions if present. The example given had only one problem statement. So perhaps in this case, we need to include both parts in the problem statement.\n\nBut let me check the example again. The original example had only one problem: prove A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem included that. In this case, the user's problem has two parts: proving the first limit is 1/2, and calculating the second limit. So the problem part should include both.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have the assumption that 0^0 is defined as 1, and the problem includes both limit questions.",
