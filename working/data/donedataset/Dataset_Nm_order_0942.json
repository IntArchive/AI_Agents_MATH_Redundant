    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here is my solution: Step 1. Reduction to an integral representation Let $S$ denote the summation in question. Then by the successive application of integration by parts, we obtain \\begin{align*}\nS &= 8 \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{1}{x} \\int_{0}^{x/2} \\frac{\\arcsin^{2} t}{t} \\, dt dx\n = -8\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{\\arcsin^{2} (x/2)}{x} \\log x \\, dx \\\\\n&= 8 \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{\\arcsin (x/2)}{\\sqrt{1 - (x/2)^{2}}} \\log^{2} x \\, \\frac{dx}{2}.\n\\end{align*} Thus with the substitution $x = 2 \\sin\\theta$, we have $$ S = 8 \\int_{0}^{\\frac{\\pi}{6}} \\theta \\log^{2} (2 \\sin\\theta) \\, d\\theta. $$ To evaluate this integral, note that for $0 < \\theta < \\frac{\\pi}{6}$ we have $$ e^{i\\theta} \\cdot 2 \\sin \\theta = i \\cdot (1 - e^{2i\\theta}). $$ Taking logarithm (with the branch cut $(-\\infty, 0]$ as usual) to both sides, it follows that $$ i\\theta + \\log (2\\sin\\theta) = \\frac{i\\pi}{2} + \\log(1 - e^{2i\\theta}). $$ Cubing both sides and integrating on $\\left( 0, \\frac{\\pi}{6} \\right)$ and taking imaginary parts only, $$ S = \\frac{2}{3} \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{6} \\right)^{4} + \\frac{8}{3} \\Im \\int_{0}^{\\frac{\\pi}{6}} \\left( \\frac{i\\pi}{2} + \\log(1 - e^{2i\\theta}) \\right)^{3} \\, d\\theta. \\tag{1} $$ Step 2. Some complex-analysis techniques Now we focus on the integral in the imaginary part: $$ I := \\int_{0}^{\\frac{\\pi}{6}} \\left( \\frac{i\\pi}{2} + \\log(1 - e^{2i\\theta}) \\right)^{3} \\, d\\theta \\tag{2}. $$ Once we evaluate the imaginary part of $I$, the identity $(1)$ immediately gives us the answer.

But since the integrand is analytic for $0 < \\Re z < 1$, we may change the path of integration as $z = \\omega t$ for $0 \\leq t \\leq 1$ (blue-colored path in the figure above). This gives $$ I = \\frac{1}{2i} \\int_{0}^{1} \\left( \\frac{i\\pi}{6} + \\log t \\right)^{3} \\frac{\\omega \\, dt}{\\omega t - 1}. $$ Plugging $t = e^{-x}$, $I$ reduces to \\begin{align*}\nI\n&= \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{6} + ix \\right)^{3} \\frac{\\omega e^{-x}}{1 - \\omega e^{-x}} \\, dx\n = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\omega^{n} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{6} + ix \\right)^{3} e^{-nx} \\, dx \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\omega^{n} \\left( -\\frac{6 i}{n^4}-\\frac{\\pi }{n^3}+\\frac{i \\pi ^2}{12 n^2}+\\frac{\\pi ^3}{216 n} \\right).\n\\end{align*} Taking the imaginary part, \\begin{align*}\n\\Im I\n&= -3 \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\cos (n\\pi/3)}{n^4} + \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\sin (n\\pi/3)}{n^3} + \\frac{\\pi^2}{24} \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\cos (n\\pi/3)}{n^2} - \\frac{\\pi^3}{432} \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\sin (n\\pi/3)}{n}. \\tag{3}\n\\end{align*} Step 3.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants to prove that the sum from n=1 to infinity of 1/(n^4 * binomial(2n, n)) equals 17π^4/3240. They mentioned having already proven similar sums for 1/(n * binomial(2n, n)) and 1/(n^2 * binomial(2n, n)), which result in π/3√3 and π²/18 respectively. Now they're tackling the n^4 case and have an integral expression involving (arcsin t)^2 / t.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how those previous sums were proven. Usually, such series involving binomial coefficients can be approached using generating functions or integral transforms. The user provided an integral formula: sum_{n=1}^∞ (2x)^{2n} / (n^3 binomial(2n, n)) = 4 ∫₀^x (arcsin t)² / t dt. They want to divide by x and integrate both sides. \n\nSo, their plan is probably to set up an integral equation that, when manipulated, gives the desired sum. Let's parse their integral formula. If we let x = 1/2, then (2x)^{2n} becomes 1^{2n} = 1, so the left-hand side becomes the sum 1/(n^3 binomial(2n, n)), which is related but not exactly the n^4 term they need. Wait, their target is n^4 in the denominator, but their current integral involves n^3. That suggests that integrating once more might introduce another factor of n in the denominator, turning n^3 into n^4. \n\nLet me check their approach: they have the sum involving n^3 binomial(2n,n), which equals 4 times the integral of (arcsin t)^2 / t from 0 to x. If they divide both sides by x and then integrate from 0 to some upper limit, say 1/2, that would introduce another integral, potentially summing over n with an additional 1/n term. Wait, integrating (2x)^{2n}/x with respect to x would give something like ∫ (2x)^{2n}/x dx = ∫ (4^n x^{2n-1}) dx = 4^n x^{2n}/(2n). So when you integrate from 0 to a, you get 4^n a^{2n}/(2n). If the original sum has 1/(n^3 binomial(2n,n)) times (2x)^{2n}, dividing by x and integrating might lead to a term with 1/(n^4 binomial(2n,n)). \n\nBut let's work this out more carefully. Suppose S(x) = sum_{n=1}^∞ (2x)^{2n}/(n^3 binomial(2n,n)) = 4 ∫₀^x (arcsin t)^2 / t dt. Then, if we consider integrating S(x)/x from x=0 to x=1/2, that would be ∫₀^{1/2} [sum_{n=1}^∞ (2x)^{2n}/(n^3 binomial(2n,n))] / x dx = sum_{n=1}^∞ ∫₀^{1/2} (2x)^{2n} / (x n^3 binomial(2n,n)) dx. \n\nSimplifying the integral inside the sum: ∫ (4^n x^{2n}) / (x n^3 binomial(2n,n)) dx = 4^n / (n^3 binomial(2n,n)) ∫ x^{2n -1} dx from 0 to 1/2. The integral of x^{2n-1} is x^{2n}/(2n), evaluated from 0 to 1/2, which is (1/2)^{2n}/(2n) = 1/(2^{2n} * 2n) = 1/(4^n * 2n). Therefore, the entire integral becomes 4^n / (n^3 binomial(2n,n)) * 1/(4^n * 2n) ) = 1/(2n^4 binomial(2n,n)). Therefore, the left-hand side of the integrated equation becomes sum_{n=1}^∞ 1/(2n^4 binomial(2n,n)), which is half of the target sum. So the left-hand side is (1/2) * target sum.\n\nOn the other hand, the right-hand side is ∫₀^{1/2} [4 ∫₀^x (arcsin t)^2 / t dt] / x dx. So, this is 4 ∫₀^{1/2} (1/x) [∫₀^x (arcsin t)^2 / t dt] dx. This seems like a double integral, which we can swap the order of integration using Fubini's theorem. Let me visualize the region of integration: t goes from 0 to x, and x goes from 0 to 1/2. So, for each t between 0 and 1/2, x ranges from t to 1/2. Therefore, swapping the integrals gives 4 ∫₀^{1/2} (arcsin t)^2 / t [∫_{t}^{1/2} (1/x) dx] dt. The inner integral ∫_{t}^{1/2} (1/x) dx = ln(1/(2t)). Therefore, the right-hand side becomes 4 ∫₀^{1/2} (arcsin t)^2 / t * ln(1/(2t)) dt. \n\nNow, substituting u = 2t (maybe?), but this seems complicated. Alternatively, recall that the integral involves arcsin t and log terms. This might relate to known integrals or series expansions. Alternatively, perhaps expanding (arcsin t)^2 into its power series and integrating term by term. \n\nRecall that arcsin t = ∑_{k=0}^∞ ( (2k)! )/(4^k (k!)^2 (2k+1)) ) t^{2k+1}, so (arcsin t)^2 would be the square of this series, resulting in a double sum. However, integrating this term by term multiplied by ln(1/(2t)) might be messy, but perhaps there's a smarter way. \n\nAlternatively, recognizing that 17π^4/3240 is related to ζ(4), since ζ(4) = π^4/90, so 17/36 ζ(4) = 17/36 * π^4/90 = 17π^4/(36*90) = 17π^4/3240, which matches the target. So, the problem is to show that the sum equals 17/36 ζ(4). \n\nGiven that the user has already derived an integral expression, maybe proceed by evaluating the double integral on the right-hand side. Let me denote the right-hand side integral as 4 ∫₀^{1/2} [ (arcsin t)^2 / t ] * ln(1/(2t)) dt. Let me make substitution: let t = sin θ / 2, since when t=1/2, θ=π/6. Then dt = (cos θ / 2) dθ. But maybe another substitution. Alternatively, set u = arcsin t, so when t ranges from 0 to 1/2, u ranges from 0 to π/6. Then t = sin u, dt = cos u du. Substitute into the integral:\n\n4 ∫₀^{π/6} [ u^2 / sin u ] * ln(1/(2 sin u)) * cos u du\n\nSimplify the integrand:\n\n4 ∫₀^{π/6} u^2 * (cos u / sin u) * [ -ln(2 sin u) ] du\n\nWhich is -4 ∫₀^{π/6} u^2 cot u ln(2 sin u) du\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe there's a known integral formula here. Alternatively, expand ln(2 sin u) as ln 2 + ln(sin u). Then split the integral into two parts:\n\n-4 ln 2 ∫₀^{π/6} u^2 cot u du -4 ∫₀^{π/6} u^2 cot u ln(sin u) du\n\nHmm. These integrals might be challenging. Alternatively, consider expanding in terms of Fourier series. Recall that ln(2 sin u) = -∑_{k=1}^∞ cos(2k u)/k, which is a known expansion. But integrating u^2 cot u times this series could be a path forward, though quite involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps instead of going through this integral approach, there's a generating function identity or a relation to the Beta function or zeta functions. Alternatively, known results for central binomial coefficient sums. \n\nAlternatively, recall that sums involving 1/(n^k binomial(2n,n)) can sometimes be expressed in terms of the Riemann zeta function or Dirichlet eta function. For example, the sum for k=1 and k=2 are known, and perhaps there's a pattern or a recursive relation. \n\nAlternatively, the user might need to use integration by parts on the integral expression they have. Let's go back to their integral formula. They have:\n\nsum_{n=1}^∞ (2x)^{2n}/(n^3 binomial(2n,n)) = 4 ∫₀^x (arcsin t)^2 / t dt\n\nThey want to divide by x and integrate from 0 to 1/2. As we saw earlier, integrating S(x)/x from 0 to 1/2 gives (1/2) * target sum. So the target sum is twice the integral of S(x)/x from 0 to 1/2. Which is twice the double integral we discussed earlier. But perhaps evaluating that double integral requires some advanced techniques.\n\nAlternatively, consult known mathematical references or papers. I recall that there's a paper by David H. Bailey, Jonathan M. Borwein, and David Broadhurst that discusses similar sums and their relations to elliptic integrals and zeta functions. However, without looking up references, perhaps proceed by expanding (arcsin t)^2 as a power series.\n\nAs mentioned before, arcsin t = ∑_{k=0}^∞ ( (2k)! )/(4^k (k!)^2 (2k+1)) ) t^{2k+1}, so squaring this gives a Cauchy product. Then multiplying by 1/t gives ∑ ... t^{2k}, and then integrating term by term. Then multiplying by ln(1/(2t)) and integrating again. This seems quite involved, but perhaps manageable.\n\nAlternatively, consider changing variable in the integral to make it more tractable. Let u = 2t, so when t goes from 0 to 1/2, u goes from 0 to 1. Then the integral becomes:\n\n4 ∫₀^{1/2} (arcsin t)^2 / t * ln(1/(2t)) dt = 4 ∫₀^1 (arcsin(u/2))^2 / (u/2) * ln(1/u) * (du/2)\n\nSimplify this:\n\n4 * (2/u) * ln(1/u) * (du/2) from 0 to1 becomes 4 * ∫₀^1 [arcsin(u/2)]^2 * (2/u) * ln(1/u) * (du/2) = 4 * ∫₀^1 [arcsin(u/2)]^2 * (1/u) * ln(1/u) du\n\nBut this substitution might not help much. Alternatively, expand [arcsin(u/2)]^2 into its power series. Let me recall that arcsin(z) = z + (1/6)z^3 + (3/40)z^5 + ... So [arcsin(z)]^2 = z^2 + (1/3)z^4 + (8/45)z^6 + ... \n\nSubstituting z = u/2, [arcsin(u/2)]^2 = (u/2)^2 + (1/3)(u/2)^4 + (8/45)(u/2)^6 + ... = u²/4 + u⁴/(3*16) + 8 u⁶/(45*64) + ... \n\nThen multiplying by (1/u) ln(1/u) gives (u/4) ln(1/u) + (u³/(48)) ln(1/u) + ... \n\nIntegrating term by term from 0 to1:\n\nEach term is ∫₀^1 u^{2k-1} ln(1/u) du. Let me compute this integral. Let’s make substitution v = -ln u, so u = e^{-v}, du = -e^{-v} dv. When u=1, v=0; u=0, v=∞. The integral becomes ∫₀^∞ e^{-(2k)v} v dv = 1/(2k)^2 Γ(2) = 1/(4k²). So ∫₀^1 u^{2k-1} ln(1/u) du = 1/(4k²).\n\nTherefore, each term in the expansion would contribute a coefficient times 1/(4k²). So the first term is (1/4) * ∫₀^1 u ln(1/u) du = (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16. The second term is (1/48) * ∫₀^1 u³ ln(1/u) du = (1/48)*(1/(4*(2)^2)) = 1/(48*16) = 1/768. Wait, maybe this approach is too tedious. \n\nAlternatively, recognize that this integral might relate to ζ(4) through known series. Given that the sum equals 17/36 ζ(4), and ζ(4) = π^4/90, this would give 17π^4/3240. The key is to connect the integral evaluation to ζ(4). \n\nAlternatively, consider using the integral expression for ζ(4). But I'm not sure. Maybe another approach entirely. Since the user mentioned they have the sum up to n^3 binomial(2n,n), perhaps integrating once more would give the n^4 term. Alternatively, use generating functions and differentiate or integrate to relate the series. \n\nAnother thought: the sum in question is similar to known central binomial series. For example, using the identity that 1/binomial(2n,n) = 2n ∫₀^1 t^{n}(1-t)^{n} dt. But substituting this into the sum and swapping sum and integral might lead to an integral involving polylogarithms or other special functions. \n\nAlternatively, recall that 1/binomial(2n,n) = \\frac{n+1}{4^n} \\int_0^1 t^{n}(1-t)^{n} dt, but I need to confirm. Alternatively, use generating functions for central binomial coefficients. \n\nAlternatively, consider using the generating function for the series sum_{n=1}^∞ \\frac{x^{2n}}{n^4 binomial(2n,n}}, set x=1, and relate it to known constants. The user's integral expression might be a part of this generating function. \n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps the answer involves recognizing that the integral after swapping can be evaluated in terms of ζ(4) through known integrals or series manipulations. Alternatively, referring to the paper by J. M. Borwein and team where they derive such sums using hypergeometric functions or elliptic integrals. \n\nSince this is a step-by-step explanation, but the actual answer requires formatting the problem as per the user's instructions, I need to extract the assumptions and problem statement. However, looking at the original question on Math Stack Exchange, the user is asking how to prove the sum equals 17π^4/3240, given that they have already proven lower-order cases and have an integral formula. The key assumptions here are about the convergence of the series, the validity of swapping sums and integrals, and perhaps the integral expression they derived. However, in the example provided, assumptions were more about the variables (like n being integer, divisible by 7). In this case, the problem is a pure mathematical identity, so the main assumption is the convergence of the series and the validity of the integral representation. But according to the example, assumptions are specific conditions. Since the original problem doesn't specify particular conditions on n (as it's a sum over n starting from 1 to infinity), maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond the series being defined. However, the user's integral formula might rely on certain conditions, like x being in a certain interval for convergence. \n\nBut in the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7, which were part of the original problem. In this current problem, the original question doesn't state any specific conditions; it's a general series. Therefore, perhaps the formatted problem doesn't require any assumptions beyond the series definition. Wait, but in the example, the assumption included n being an integer even though the problem didn't explicitly state it. So perhaps here, the assumption is that the series converges, but how to phrase that? Maybe the problem is already assuming standard convergence for such series. \n\nLooking at the user's example, they included the assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, which was part of the original problem's context (to prove divisibility by 91, which factors into 7 and 13, hence requiring n to be divisible by 7). In the current problem, the series starts at n=1 and goes to infinity, so the assumptions might just be that the series is considered in the standard mathematical sense, with n being a positive integer. But the original question didn't specify any particular conditions, so maybe there are no explicit assumptions to list beyond the series definition. However, the example included assumptions even if they were part of the problem's inherent conditions. \n\nAlternatively, since the problem is about proving an identity, there are no specific assumptions other than the series being well-defined. Therefore, the formatted problem might have an empty assumption section, but according to the example, assumptions were included even if they were basic. Wait, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", so the assumption listed was \"$n$ is an integer\". But the original problem here says \"for every integer n\", but in the current problem, it's a sum from n=1 to infinity, so n is a positive integer. Therefore, the assumption would be \"n is a positive integer\".\n\nBut let me check the user's example again. The original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" The formatted assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, but the original problem didn't say n is divisible by 7; that must have been an error. Wait, looking back: the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in their example? Because if the original problem is to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91, which is 7*13, then perhaps the correct assumption is that n is an integer, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. But the example's formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", which might be incorrect unless the original problem had that condition. Wait, this suggests that maybe the user's example is flawed, but regardless, we need to follow their format.\n\nIn their example, even though the original problem states \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, which seems to incorrectly add an extra condition. Perhaps there was a misinterpretation. Anyway, we need to proceed with the current problem.\n\nThe current problem is to prove that sum_{n=1}^\\infty 1/(n^4 binomial(2n,n)) =17π^4/3240. The assumptions here would be that n is a positive integer (since the sum starts at n=1), and the series converges. But according to the example, each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. So, the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is a positive integer,\n- the series $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^4 \\binom{2n}{n}$ converges.\n\nBut in the example, the assumption was listed as two separate items: \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". Here, the original problem doesn't specify conditions on n beyond being in the sum from 1 to infinity, so n is a positive integer. The convergence is probably a given in the problem's context, but since the example included basic assumptions, it's safer to list \"n is a positive integer\" as an assumption. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^4 \\binom{2n}{n}} = \\frac{17\\pi^4}{3240}.$$\n\nBut wait, in the example, assumptions were about the variable in the expression. Here, the variable in the sum is n, which is a dummy variable, but since it's a sum over n starting from 1, the assumption is that n ranges over positive integers. However, in the problem statement, it's standard to have n as a summation index, so perhaps the assumption is redundant. However, following the example, it's better to list \"n is a positive integer\" as an assumption.",
