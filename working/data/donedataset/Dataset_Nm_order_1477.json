    "Content": "On a compact Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ , a function $f$ is called harmonic if $\\Delta_{g} f = 0$ , and it is known that the only harmonic function on a compact riemannian manifold is constant function. I wonder how one would prove this. So locally $\\Delta_{g}$ is just a second order elliptic operator, thus has the weak maximum principle, which says that the max must appear on the boundary. However I do not think this is enough to prove that harmonic functions are constants. Instead, we need the strong maximum principle which I think holds when the operator is strongly elliptic. Is $\\Delta_{g}$ strongly elliptic?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Ivo Terek's answer gives the most elegant answer when $M$ is oriented. (If un-oriented, pass to the orientation double cover.) I'll answer directly your question about the strong maximum principle and ellipticity. Relative to a coordinate system, one has $$\\Delta f=g^{ij}\\frac{\\partial^2f}{\\partial x^i\\partial x^j}-\\frac{1}{2}g^{ij}g^{k\\ell}\\Big(\\frac{\\partial g_{j\\ell}}{\\partial x^i}+\\frac{\\partial g_{i\\ell}}{\\partial x^j}-\\frac{\\partial g_{ij}}{\\partial x^\\ell}\\Big)\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^k}.$$ Treating this as a function on a bounded open subset of Euclidean space, then, uniform ellipticity would mean that there are positive constants $\\lambda$ and $\\Lambda$ with $\\lambda I\\leq[g^{ij}]\\leq\\Lambda I$ , as $n\\times n$ matrices. This is not necessarily the case, imagine for instance polar coordinates on the sphere, so that $g=d\\theta^2+\\sin^2\\theta\\,d\\varphi^2$ and so, in this case, the upper bound $\\Lambda$ does not exist. One could also imagine examples where a positive lower bound $\\lambda$ does not exist. However, the restriction of this function to any precompact subregion of the coordinate chart ensures the existence (and finiteness and positivity) of the constants, by compactness and continuity of the matrix-valued function $[g^{ij}]$ . So all you need to accept is the following statement: there is a coordinate cover $\\{(U_\\alpha,\\varphi_\\alpha)\\}$ of the manifold and for each $\\alpha$ an open precompact set $K_\\alpha\\subset U_\\alpha$ such that $\\{K_\\alpha\\}$ remains an open cover of the manifold. Relative to any coordinate chart $(K_\\alpha,\\varphi_\\alpha)$ , the operator $f\\mapsto \\Delta f$ is uniformly elliptic, and so one can replay the proof of the Hopf maximum principle and recover the usual strong maximum principle. This leads to a result slightly stronger than in Ivo Terek's answer, since there the manifold must be compact for the integration to work. Here one gets the strong maximum principle, where it only has to be assumed that a maximum (or minimum) is achieved. Also of interest is S.-T. Yau's Liouville theorem (Indiana Univ. Math. J. 1976) which says that if $(M,g)$ is a complete Riemannian manifold and $u\\geq 0$ is harmonic with $\\int_M u^p\\,d\\mu_g<\\infty$ for some $p>2$ , then $du=0$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition for one object. Then the problem statement is simplified.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question. The title is \"Why must harmonic functions on compact Riemannian manifolds be constant?\" and the question body goes into more detail. The user is asking for a proof that the only harmonic functions on a compact Riemannian manifold are constant functions. They mention the weak maximum principle but think it's insufficient, suggesting the strong maximum principle might be needed. They also question whether the Laplacian Δ_g is strongly elliptic.\n\nSo, the problem is to prove that harmonic functions on a compact Riemannian manifold are constant. The assumptions need to be extracted. Let's see:\n\n1. The manifold M is compact.\n2. The manifold has a Riemannian metric g.\n3. The function f is harmonic, meaning Δ_g f = 0.\n\nWait, in the original problem statement, the user says \"On a compact Riemannian manifold (M,g), a function f is called harmonic if Δ_g f = 0, and it is known that the only harmonic function on a compact Riemannian manifold is constant function.\" So the assumptions here are that M is compact, with Riemannian metric g, and f is harmonic (Δ_g f = 0). The problem is to prove f must be constant.\n\nBut the example given by the user had two assumptions for n: being an integer and being divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions are about M, g, and f. Each assumption should be one line, one property per object.\n\nSo breaking down:\n\nAssumption:\n- M is a compact Riemannian manifold.\n- The metric on M is g.\n- f is a harmonic function on M (i.e., Δ_g f = 0).\n\nBut wait, the problem is to show that any harmonic function on such a manifold is constant. So the problem is: Given a compact Riemannian manifold (M, g), prove that any harmonic function f (Δ_g f = 0) is constant.\n\nBut in the example, assumptions included both the domain (n is integer) and a condition (n divisible by 7). Here, the assumptions are M compact, Riemannian metric g, and f harmonic. Each of these is a separate assumption.\n\nI need to ensure each line is one assumption, one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- M is a compact Riemannian manifold,\n- The manifold M is equipped with a Riemannian metric g,\n- f: M → ℝ is a harmonic function (i.e., Δ_g f = 0).\n\nProblem: Prove that f is constant.\n\nWait, but in the original question, the user is confused about using the weak vs. strong maximum principle. They ask if Δ_g is strongly elliptic. So maybe there's an assumption about the ellipticity? But in the problem statement as given, the user is told that \"it is known\" that harmonic functions are constant, so the problem is to prove that. The assumptions needed for the proof would include the compactness of M, the Riemannian metric, and harmonicity of f. The question is about the method, particularly the maximum principle.\n\nBut according to the task, the user wants to structure the problem as per the format, filtering unrelated info. The original question mentions local ellipticity, weak maximum principle, and asks if Δ_g is strongly elliptic. However, when structuring the problem, we need to list the assumptions and the problem.\n\nThe original problem is: Prove that harmonic functions on compact Riemannian manifolds are constant. So the assumptions are:\n\n1. M is a compact Riemannian manifold.\n2. f is a harmonic function on M (Δ_g f = 0).\n\nProblem: Prove that f is constant.\n\nWait, the example given had two assumptions for n: being integer and divisible by 7. Here, the main assumptions are the compactness of M, the existence of the Riemannian metric (which is part of the manifold's structure), and the harmonicity of f. Each of these is a separate line. However, \"Riemannian manifold\" already includes the metric g, so maybe \"equipped with a Riemannian metric g\" is redundant. But perhaps to specify the metric is part of the structure. Alternatively, maybe split into:\n\n- M is a compact manifold,\n- M is equipped with a Riemannian metric g,\n- f is a harmonic function (Δ_g f = 0).\n\nBut perhaps that's over-splitting. The key is that each assumption is one line, one condition per object. The problem is then to prove f is constant.\n\nI think that's the correct breakdown. Let me check the original example again. The example had two assumptions: n is integer, n is divisible by 7. So each assumption is a separate condition on the same object. Here, the assumptions are different objects (M, g, f) with their own properties. So each line is a separate assumption.\n\nSo the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nM is a compact Riemannian manifold,\nf is a harmonic function on M (i.e., Δ_g f = 0).\n\nProblem: Prove that f is constant.\n\nWait, but the metric g is part of the Riemannian manifold structure, so maybe it's included in the first assumption. The original problem statement says \"On a compact Riemannian manifold (M,g)\", so the first assumption is that (M,g) is a compact Riemannian manifold, and the second is that f is harmonic. So each of these is a separate line.\n\nTherefore:\n\nAssumption:\n(M, g) is a compact Riemannian manifold,\nf: M → ℝ is a harmonic function (i.e., Δ_g f = 0).\n\nProblem: Prove that f is constant.\n\nYes, that seems correct. The user's example combined two conditions on n, but here the two assumptions are on different objects (the manifold and the function). The problem is to prove f is constant.\n\nSo I think this is the correct formatted version. The original question had some discussion about maximum principles and ellipticity, but those are part of the solution approach, not the problem's assumptions. The task is to filter unrelated information and structure the problem. The key assumptions are the compactness of the manifold and the harmonicity of the function. The problem is to prove the function is constant.",
