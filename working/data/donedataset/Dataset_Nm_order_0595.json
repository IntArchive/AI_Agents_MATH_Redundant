    "AcceptedAnswer": "You only need that the ground field $K$ is a complete normed field, e.g. $K \\in \\{\\mathbb{R},\\mathbb{C}\\}$. If $(x^{(k)})_k$ is a sequence in $U := \\langle b_1, \\dotsc, b_n \\rangle$ which converges to some $x \\in V$ then $(x^{(k)})_k$ is a Cauchy sequence. Because $K$ is a complete normed field the finite dimensional normed space $U$ is complete. Therefore $(x^{(k)})_k$ converges to some $y \\in U$. By the uniqueness of limits in $V$ we already have $x = y \\in U$. So $U$ is closed. Notice that the statement does not necessarily hold for normed spaces over non-complete normed fields , even if all occuring vector spaces are finite-dimensional. Take for example the $\\mathbb{Q}$-vector spaces $\\mathbb{Q} \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{2}]$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let's try to tackle this problem. The user is asking how to prove that a finite-dimensional linear subspace is closed in a normed vector space. They also have some questions about the conditions required—like whether the space needs to be Banach or if the field has to be the real numbers.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question carefully. The problem states: Given a linear space V over a field F, with a norm, and a base B. They want to prove that the span of a finite number of basis vectors is closed. They're also asking if this is generally true, if V needs to be Banach, or if F must be the real numbers.\n\nSo, the key points here are:\n\n1. V is a linear space over field F.\n2. There's a norm defined on V.\n3. A base B is given (probably a basis for the subspace).\n4. The subspace in question is the span of finitely many vectors from B.\n5. Need to prove this subspace is closed in the norm-induced topology.\n6. Questions about the necessity of V being Banach or F being real numbers.\n\nNow, structuring the assumptions and problem as per the required format. The example given in the prompt helps. The assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. Let me see.\n\nThe original problem mentions a linear space V, a field F, a norm on V, a base B, and the subspace span{b1,...,bn} where each bi is in B. The user is asking whether V needs to be Banach (i.e., complete) or F needs to be real numbers. So in the assumptions, we need to list:\n\n- V is a linear space over field F.\n- A norm is defined on V.\n- B is a basis for V? Wait, the question says \"a Base B\". But then the subspace is span of some b_i from B. So maybe B is a basis for the entire space V, and the subspace is a finite-dimensional subspace spanned by some basis vectors.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"Given a linear space V , a field F , a norm on V and a Base B.\" So B is a base (basis) for V? Then span{b1,...,bn} is a finite-dimensional subspace. The question is whether this subspace is closed.\n\nBut in the assumptions, we need to list each condition. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- V is a linear space over field F.\n- A norm is defined on V.\n- B is a basis for V.\n- The subspace is the span of a finite subset of B.\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"the subspace span{b1, b2, ..., bn} where b_i ∈ B\". So each bi is an element of the basis B. The problem is to prove that this span is closed. However, the user is questioning whether additional conditions are needed: does V need to be Banach, or F needs to be real numbers?\n\nIn the example provided earlier, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem didn't state that. Wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake? Because in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\", which would restrict it. Wait, but in the example given, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem lists assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" That seems like an error. Wait, perhaps the example was incorrect. Because if the original problem is for every integer n, then there's no assumption that n is divisible by 7. Unless maybe there was a misstatement.\n\nBut perhaps in the example, the original problem actually had an extra condition, but the user's example might have a typo. Anyway, moving on.\n\nIn this current problem, the user is asking whether V needs to be Banach or F needs to be real numbers. So, in the assumptions, do we need to include that F is the real numbers? Or is that part of the problem's question?\n\nThe user is asking \"Do I need V to be a Banach space? Or do I need F to be the real numbers?\" So those are questions about the necessary conditions for the statement to hold. Therefore, in the problem statement, the user wants to know whether under the given assumptions (V is a normed linear space over F, with basis B), whether the finite-dimensional subspace is closed, and whether F needs to be real or V needs to be Banach.\n\nBut when structuring the problem, the Assumption part should list the given conditions. The problem is then to prove the subspace is closed, and the user is questioning if the assumptions are sufficient or if more are needed (like F = R or V Banach).\n\nWait, but according to the format, the user wants to filter the original problem and list the assumptions and the problem. The original problem is asking how to prove that span{b1,...,bn} is closed, given V is a normed space over F with a basis B. Then the user's questions are whether it's generally true (i.e., under these assumptions) or if more is needed.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user is presenting the problem and then their own questions. The task is to structure the problem as per the format: Assumptions and Problem.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be the given conditions in the problem, and the problem is the actual question.\n\nIn the original problem, the user states: \"Given a linear space V , a field F , a norm on V and a Base B. How do I prove that the subspace span{b1,...,bn} is a closed set... Do I need V to be Banach? Or do I need F to be real numbers?\"\n\nSo, the given assumptions are:\n\n- V is a linear space over F.\n- A norm is defined on V.\n- B is a basis for V. (Assuming \"Base\" here means basis)\n- The subspace is the span of a finite set of vectors from B.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that this subspace is closed. However, the user is questioning the necessity of V being Banach or F being real.\n\nBut in the example, the problem was restructured to include assumptions that might not have been explicit in the original. For instance, in the example, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". So perhaps in that case, there was an error, or maybe the original problem had a typo. Alternatively, maybe the example is illustrative of how to structure even if some assumptions are missing.\n\nIn this current problem, the user's original question includes some conditions (V, F, norm, base B) and the problem is to prove closure. The user is then asking if more conditions are needed.\n\nBut when structuring the problem according to the format, the Assumption part should list all the given conditions, and the Problem part is the actual question. But perhaps in this case, the user hasn't explicitly stated all the required conditions. For instance, if the problem is to prove that the finite-dimensional subspace is closed in a normed space, but in general, finite-dimensional subspaces are closed in normed spaces only if the field is complete (e.g., real or complex numbers). So if the field F is not complete, maybe this doesn't hold. Therefore, the assumptions might need to include that F is R or C.\n\nBut according to the original problem statement, the user is asking whether F needs to be the real numbers. So the original problem doesn't specify that F is real; it's part of the question. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumptions should include only what's given, not the answers. So the assumptions are:\n\n- V is a linear space over field F.\n- A norm is defined on V.\n- B is a basis for V.\n- The subspace is the span of a finite subset of B.\n\nBut then the problem is to prove that this subspace is closed, and the user is asking whether V needs to be Banach or F needs to be real. However, according to the format, the Problem part should be the actual problem, which includes the question. But the example given in the prompt shows the problem as \"Prove that... is divisible by 91.\" The user's additional questions (\"Do I need V to be Banach...\") are part of the original question but how to structure them?\n\nWait, looking at the example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut in the original problem, it's \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect unless there was a misstatement.\n\nBut perhaps the example is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem had a typo, but the user's example is illustrative. Maybe in the example, the correct assumption is that n is divisible by 7, but the original problem statement was miswritten. Regardless, the task is to structure the given problem into assumptions and problem.\n\nIn the current case, the user's question includes multiple parts: the main problem (prove the subspace is closed) and additional questions (is it generally true? Do I need V to be Banach or F to be real?).\n\nBut according to the format, the Problem part should be the main problem. However, the user's additional questions are also part of the original problem. So perhaps the Problem part should include all of them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the additional questions are considered part of the problem statement. For example:\n\nProblem: Prove that the subspace span{...} is closed. Is this generally true? Do I need V to be a Banach space or F to be the real numbers?\n\nBut in the example, only the problem statement is given, not the additional questions. Wait, in the example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem includes the assumption that n is divisible by 7. But the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which doesn't require divisibility by 7. So there's a contradiction. Maybe the example is incorrect.\n\nIn any case, focusing on the current problem. The user has a main problem (prove subspace is closed) and is asking if additional conditions are required. But the format requires \"Problem: <The problem>\".\n\nSo perhaps the Problem part should encapsulate all the user's questions, i.e., \"Prove that the subspace... is closed. Is it generally true? Do I need V to be Banach or F to be real?\"\n\nBut the example in the prompt shows that the Problem is just the mathematical statement. So maybe the additional questions are considered part of the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the additional questions are considered part of the problem's requirements. For example, the problem is to prove the subspace is closed, and determine whether it's generally true, and whether V needs to be Banach or F needs to be real.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would include all these questions in the Problem section.\n\nHence, structuring:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- V is a linear space over field F.\n- A norm is defined on V.\n- B is a basis for V.\n- The subspace is the span of a finite subset of B.\n\nProblem: Prove that the subspace span{b1, ..., bn} is a closed set. Is this statement generally true? Does it require V to be a Banach space or F to be the real numbers?\n\nWait, but in the example, the Problem was just the mathematical statement. The user's additional questions (\"Is it generally true? Do I need...\") are part of the problem statement. Therefore, they should be included in the Problem section.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the additional questions are part of the problem's requirements. So the problem is to prove closure and determine the necessary conditions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have the assumptions as above, and the problem as a combination of proving closure and determining the conditions.\n\nBut the example provided in the prompt seems to take only the main problem and not the additional questions. For example, in the original problem, the user might have asked additional questions, but the formatted problem only includes the main problem. Wait, in the example, the original problem is \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n)... is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem includes the assumptions and the problem as \"Prove that A(n)... is divisible by 91.\" So perhaps the additional questions in the current problem should be included in the Problem section.\n\nAlternatively, the assistant needs to read the original question, filter out unrelated information, and structure the problem. \"Unrelated information\" might be parts of the question that are not directly the problem statement. However, in this case, the user is asking both to prove something and whether certain conditions are needed. These are part of the problem.\n\nBut how to structure that? The example shows that additional conditions (like n divisible by 7) were included in the assumptions even if the original problem didn't state them. Wait, that example seems flawed. If the original problem says \"for every integer n\", then the assumption shouldn't restrict n to being divisible by 7. That example might have been incorrect.\n\nIn any case, returning to the current problem. The user is given V, a normed space over F with a basis B, and a finite-dimensional subspace spanned by some b_i. They want to prove it's closed and ask if V needs to be Banach or F needs to be real.\n\nThe key here is that in normed spaces, finite-dimensional subspaces are closed if the field is complete (e.g., real or complex numbers). So if F is the real numbers, then yes. But if F is, say, the rational numbers, this might not hold. Also, V doesn't need to be Banach; the result holds in any normed space over a complete field.\n\nTherefore, the necessary assumptions would be:\n\n- V is a normed linear space over a complete field F (like R or C).\n- The subspace is finite-dimensional.\n\nBut in the original problem, the user didn't state that F is complete or real. Therefore, when structuring the problem, the assumptions are as given by the user, and the problem includes the question about whether more conditions are needed.\n\nBut according to the format, the task is to list the assumptions from the problem and structure the problem. So the assumptions are what is given, not what is needed. The user's question is whether more assumptions are required.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list the given assumptions and the problem as stated, including the additional questions.\n\nHence:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- V is a linear space over field F.\n- A norm is defined on V.\n- B is a basis for V.\n- The subspace is the span of a finite subset of B.\n\nProblem: Prove that the subspace span{b1, b2, ..., bn} is a closed set. Is this statement generally true under the given assumptions? Does the proof require V to be a Banach space or F to be the real numbers?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the additional questions are considered separate and should be part of the problem. However, given the example, it seems that only the main problem is included, and the additional questions might be considered part of the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- V is a linear space over field F.\n- A norm is defined on V.\n- B is a basis for V.\n- The subspace is the span of a finite subset of B.\n\nProblem: Prove that the subspace span{b1, b2, ..., bn} is a closed set. Determine whether this holds generally or requires V to be a Banach space or F to be the real numbers.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is to prove it under the given assumptions and determine the necessary conditions. However, the user's original question is asking how to prove it and whether the assumptions are sufficient or if more are needed.\n\nIn the example provided in the prompt, the formatted problem only includes the main problem, not the additional questions. So maybe the additional questions are considered part of the original problem's context but not part of the structured problem. Therefore, the structured problem would be to prove the subspace is closed, with the given assumptions, and the user's questions about necessary conditions are filtered out as unrelated information.\n\nWait, the user instructs: \"filtered the unrelated informations\". So perhaps the additional questions (\"Is it generally true? Do I need...\") are part of the problem and should be included. But the example didn't include such questions. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the core problem is to prove the subspace is closed, and the questions about Banach or F being real are part of determining the conditions, hence part of the problem.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, but following the example where the original problem's main question is restated as the Problem, and any conditions are listed as assumptions, even if they were not originally stated (as in the example where n is assumed divisible by 7 despite the original problem saying \"for every integer n\"), perhaps in this case, we need to infer the correct assumptions.\n\nBut since the user is asking whether V needs to be Banach or F needs to be real, the formatted problem should reflect that those are part of the problem's inquiry. Therefore, the Problem part would be to prove closure and determine the necessary conditions.\n\nBut given the example, the Problem part was just the main statement. So perhaps the correct approach is to structure the main problem (prove closure) and the additional questions as part of the Problem statement.\n\nHence:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- V is a linear space over field F.\n- A norm is defined on V.\n- B is a basis for V.\n- The subspace is the span of a finite subset of B.\n\nProblem: Prove that the subspace span{b1, b2, ..., bn} is a closed set. Is this statement generally true? Does it require V to be a Banach space or F to be the real numbers?\n\nThis seems to capture all parts of the user's original question.\n\nBut to confirm, let's check the example again. The original example had the problem as \"Prove that for every integer n...\", and the formatted problem had assumptions including \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems to suggest that perhaps the assumptions include necessary conditions for the problem to hold, even if not stated in the original. But that would be incorrect unless the original problem had a mistake.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct approach is to list the assumptions as given in the original problem, and the Problem as the main question, leaving the additional inquiries as part of the Problem.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- V is a linear space over field F.\n- A norm is defined on V.\n- B is a basis for V.\n- The subspace is the span of a finite subset of B.\n\nProblem: Prove that the subspace span{b1, b2, ..., bn} is a closed set. Determine whether this result holds generally or requires V to be a Banach space or F to be the real numbers.\n\nThis way, both the proof and the conditions are part of the problem.",
