    "Content": "Show $\\operatorname{rank}(A) + \\operatorname{rank}(B) \\ge \\operatorname{rank}(A+B)$, where $A,B \\in M_{m\\times n}(\\mathbb{F})$. I'm trying to think in terms of linear transformations. We can define $T_a, T_b:\\mathbb{F}^n\\rightarrow \\mathbb{F}^m$. I know that $\\dim_{\\mathbb F}\\operatorname{Im} T_a, \\dim_{\\mathbb F}\\operatorname{Im} T_b \\le m$. What should I do next?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Hint: It suffices to prove that $C(A+B)\\subseteq C(A)+C(B)$, because\n$$\\begin{align} C(A+B)\\subseteq C(A)+C(B) &\\implies \\dim \\left(C(A+B)\\right)\\leq \\dim \\left(C(A)+C(B)\\right)\\\\\n&\\implies \\text{rank}(A+B) \\leq \\dim(C(A))+\\dim(C(B))-\\dim(C(A)\\cap C(B)).\\end{align}$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem as per the required format. The original question is about showing that the rank of matrix A plus the rank of matrix B is greater than or equal to the rank of the sum of A and B. The user mentions they are thinking in terms of linear transformations and mentions dimensions of images. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The problem states that A and B are matrices in M_{m×n}(F), so that's two assumptions: one for each matrix. Then, the ranks are involved, but those are properties of the matrices. The problem is to prove the inequality involving their ranks. Wait, the example given had assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So here, the key assumptions are about the matrices A and B. Let me check:\n\nAssumptions:\n- A is an m×n matrix over field F.\n- B is an m×n matrix over field F.\n\nBut wait, the problem is just stating A,B ∈ M_{m×n}(F), so each matrix's dimension and field are separate assumptions. The original problem doesn't mention any additional conditions like invertibility or specific ranks, so the assumptions are simply the properties of A and B being matrices of the specified size over F. The problem is the inequality of ranks. \n\nSo putting it together:\n\nAssumption:\nA is an m×n matrix over field F,\nB is an m×n matrix over field F.\n\nProblem:\nShow that rank(A) + rank(B) ≥ rank(A + B).\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included that n is divisible by 7. Here, the original problem doesn't have any such specific conditions except that A and B are matrices of the same size. So perhaps the user's example was more about extracting conditions from the problem statement. In this case, the key conditions are the matrices being of same size and over the same field. So each matrix's size and field are separate assumptions. Therefore, the formatted problem would list those as separate assumptions.",
