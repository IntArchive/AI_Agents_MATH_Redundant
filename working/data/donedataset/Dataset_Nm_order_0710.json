    "Content": "Can Some one tell me what this method is called and how it works With a detailed proof $$\\int_a^bf(x)~dx=\\int_a^bf(a+b-x)~dx$$ I've been using this a lot in definite integration but haven't seemed to have realized why it is true.  But whatever it is it always seems to work. Basically a proof of how it is always true.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here is a pictorial argument. $\\displaystyle \\int_a^b f(x) dx$ is the area under the curve $y=f(x)$ in the interval $(a,b)$ when you integrate from left to right. $\\displaystyle \\int_a^b f(a+b-x) dx$ is the area under the curve $y=f(x)$ in the interval $(a,b)$ when you integrate from right to left. Hence, both are equal.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question. The user wants me to list the assumptions and then state the problem clearly. \n\nFirst, the original problem is about proving that the integral from a to b of f(x)dx is equal to the integral from a to b of f(a + b - x)dx. The user is asking for the name of this method and a detailed proof.\n\nSo, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem involves definite integrals over the interval [a, b]. The key here is that the function f is being integrated over the same interval but with the argument transformed to a + b - x. \n\nWhat assumptions are implicitly made here? Well, the function f needs to be integrable over [a, b] for the integrals to exist. The problem probably assumes that f is a real-valued function defined on [a, b], and that it's integrable in the Riemann sense (or whichever integral they're using, but since it's a basic question, Riemann is safe). Also, the limits of integration a and b are real numbers with a < b, which is standard for definite integrals. \n\nWait, the problem statement doesn't mention anything about continuity or differentiability, just that the integral exists. So the main assumptions would be that f is integrable on [a, b], and that the substitution used in the proof is valid, which typically requires that f is integrable and the substitution function is smooth enough. But in the case of definite integrals, the substitution rule usually requires the substitution function to be differentiable with an integrable derivative, but since we're dealing with a linear substitution here, which is smooth, maybe the main assumption is just that f is integrable on [a, b]. \n\nSo breaking it down:\n\nAssumptions:\n1. f is a real-valued function defined on the interval [a, b].\n2. f is integrable on [a, b].\n3. The substitution x → a + b - x is applied, which is valid for integration over [a, b].\n\nWait, but the substitution part is part of the method, not an assumption. So maybe the assumptions are just about f and the interval. The problem itself is to prove the equality using substitution. So the key assumptions are that f is integrable on [a, b], and a and b are real numbers with a < b. \n\nWait, but the original problem doesn't specify that a < b. But in definite integrals, usually, we have a ≤ b, but even if a > b, the integral would just be the negative. However, in this case, since both integrals are from a to b, if a > b, then swapping the limits would change the sign, but here the substitution might still hold because swapping a and b would affect the substitution. But maybe the problem assumes that a and b are real numbers without specifying a < b. But to be safe, maybe list that a and b are real numbers, and f is integrable on [a, b]. \n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n- f is a real-valued function.\n- f is integrable on the interval [a, b].\n- a and b are real numbers.\n\nBut the substitution method used here (x → a + b - x) doesn't require a and b to be in any particular order, because even if a > b, the substitution would still reverse the interval, but since the integral is from a to b in both cases, the equality should hold regardless. For example, if a > b, then ∫_a^b f(x)dx = -∫_b^a f(x)dx, and similarly for the transformed integral. But the substitution would still hold because applying a + b - x when a > b would still work. So maybe the key assumptions are just that f is integrable on [a, b], and a and b are real numbers.\n\nWait, but the problem as stated in the title is ∫_a^b f(x)dx = ∫_a^b f(a + b - x)dx. The user doesn't mention any other conditions. So the assumptions are that f is integrable over [a, b], and that the substitution is valid, which for linear substitutions like this, requires no more than the integrability of f. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- f is integrable on [a, b].\n\nBut maybe also that a and b are real numbers. But in standard calculus, a and b are real numbers, so that's a given. However, to be thorough, maybe include it.\n\nSo, in the example given earlier, the original problem had an assumption about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Similarly here, the problem's assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- a and b are real numbers.\n- f is a real-valued function.\n- f is integrable on the interval [a, b].\n\nBut the problem itself is to prove the equality. So the structured problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\na and b are real numbers,\nf is integrable on [a, b].\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\int_a^b f(x)~dx = \\int_a^b f(a + b - x)~dx.$$\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem had an assumption that wasn't explicitly stated. The user's example had \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\" but in the original problem, it was \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem listed \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, that seems like maybe a mistake. Wait, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem listed an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which is not correct. Wait, perhaps the example was incorrect. Because in the original problem, it's for every integer n, so there's no assumption that n is divisible by 7. So maybe that example was wrong. Hmm, but according to the user's example, they added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, maybe there was a confusion. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem in the example: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should just be that n is an integer. The fact that 91=13*7 might require that the expression is divisible by both 7 and 13, so maybe the user mistakenly added that n is divisible by 7, but that's not correct. So perhaps the example has an error, and the correct assumption should be only that n is an integer, without the divisibility by 7.\n\nBut since the user provided that example, perhaps they have a different approach. Anyway, maybe that's a red herring. Back to the current problem.\n\nThe problem is to prove that the integral from a to b of f(x)dx equals the integral from a to b of f(a + b - x)dx. The key here is that this is a standard substitution in integrals, often referred to as \"integration by substitution\" or \"reflection\" over the midpoint (a + b)/2. The method is sometimes called \"King's Property\" of integration, though I'm not sure if that's a widely recognized term. \n\nBut regardless, the assumptions needed are that f is integrable over [a, b], and the substitution is valid. Since the substitution is linear (u = a + b - x), which is smooth (its derivative is -1, which is continuous), the substitution holds as long as f is integrable. Therefore, the main assumptions are:\n\n- a and b are real numbers (the interval endpoints).\n- f is integrable on [a, b].\n\nSo, structuring the problem as per the user's request, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\na and b are real numbers,\nf is integrable on [a, b].\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\int_a^b f(x)~dx = \\int_a^b f(a + b - x)~dx.$$\n\nI think that's correct. The user's example included assumptions that were perhaps more specific, but in this case, the necessary assumptions are the integrability of f and the interval being real numbers.",
