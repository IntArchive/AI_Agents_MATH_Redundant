    "Content": "I am trying to prove the following: Let $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{p_1},\\ldots,\\sqrt{p_n})$. Show that $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is Galois with Galois group $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^n$. I have attached my proof below not as a means of verifying it, only as a means of making my question as clear as possible. My question is: Is it correct to say that that $\\tau_i$'s generate $\\operatorname{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, and therefore that we can decompose elements of $\\operatorname{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ into compositions of these functions. My proof is as follows: To show $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is Galois we need to show it is the splitting field of a separable polynomial. The field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{p_1},\\ldots,\\sqrt{p_n})$ is obtained by an $n$ step process where step $i$ consists of adjoining $\\sqrt{p_i}$ to the field $Q_{i-1}=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{p_1},\\ldots,\\sqrt{p_{i-1}})$ and $Q_0$ is defined to be $\\mathbb{Q}$. This gives the following tower of extensions $$\\mathbb{Q}\\subset \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{p_1})\\subset \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{p_1},\\sqrt{p_2})\\subset \\cdots\\subset \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{p_1},\\ldots,\\sqrt{p_n}).$$ Note that $Q_i\\neq Q_{i+1}$, because $\\sqrt{p_{i+1}} \\not \\in Q_{i}$ for all $i$; the fact the $\\sqrt{p_1},\\ldots,\\sqrt{p_n}$ are distinct primes insures this. Since none of the $p_j$ are squares (because they are prime) we know $\\sqrt{p_j} \\not \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. Furthermore, the distinctness of the $p_j$ insure that $\\sqrt{p_i} \\neq \\sqrt{p_j}$ for all $i \\neq j$. The minimal polynomial of the extension $Q_{i+1}/Q_i$ is $f_{i+1}(X)=X^2-p_{i+1}$, which is separable with roots $\\pm\\sqrt{p_{i+1}}$. From this we see that the polynomial we are concerned with is $$f(X)=f_1(X)\\cdots f_n(X)=(X^2-p_1)\\cdots(X^2-p_n),$$ also a separable polynomial. $K$ is a splitting field for this separable polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$, and thus $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is Galois. From the tower of fields above we see they $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]=2^n$, since the degree of each $Q_i/Q_{i-1}$ is 2. From this we can deduce that $\\operatorname{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})=2^n$. As with before, $\\operatorname{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ is determined by its action on the roots of $f(X)$, which are $$\\{\\pm \\sqrt{p_1},\\ldots,\\pm \\sqrt{p_n}\\},$$ or, more correctly, on the roots of the minimal polynomial of each of these roots. Consider the map\n\\begin{equation*}\n    \\tau_{(a_1,\\ldots,a_n)}= \\begin{cases}\n      \\sqrt{p_1}& \\mapsto \\pm \\sqrt{p_1},\\\\\n      \\sqrt{p_2}& \\mapsto \\pm \\sqrt{p_2},\\\\\n\t& \\vdots\\\\\n      \\sqrt{p_n}& \\mapsto \\pm \\sqrt{p_n},\n    \\end{cases}\n\\end{equation*}\nwhere $a_i\\in \\{0,1\\}$ and $a_i=0$ means $\\sqrt{p_i} \\mapsto \\sqrt{p_i}$ and $a_i=1$ means $\\sqrt{p_i} \\mapsto \\sqrt{p_i}$. \nThis gives $2n$ possible maps which take roots of the $f_i(X)$ to roots of $f_i(X)$ (note that these are all such maps as well). Since $|\\operatorname{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})|=2^n$ all of these maps must be automorphisms of $K$. What remains to be seen is that $\\operatorname{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^n$. We can decompose $\\tau_{(a_1,\\ldots,a_n)}$ into a composition of the maps $\\tau_i:K\\rightarrow K$ defined by\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\tau_i = \\begin{cases}\n\\tau_i\\left(\\sqrt{p_j}\\right) = -\\sqrt{p_i} & \\text{for } i=j,\\\\\n\\tau_i\\left(\\sqrt{p_j}\\right) = \\sqrt{p_j} & \\text{for } i\\neq j,\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{equation*}\nwhere $\\tau_{(a_1,\\ldots,a_n)}=\\tau_1^{a_1}\\circ \\cdots \\circ \\tau_n^{a_n}$. We see that every element of $\\operatorname{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ can be obtained through the composition of $\\tau_i$'s and therefore $\\{\\tau_1,\\ldots,\\tau_n\\}$ generates $\\operatorname{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. Let $\\tau \\in \\operatorname{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ such that $\\tau_1^{a_1}\\circ \\cdots \\circ \\tau_n^{a_n}$. Define the map $\\chi: \\operatorname{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\rightarrow \\{\\pm 1\\}^n$ by first defining the action of $\\chi$ on each $\\tau_i$ by $$\\chi(\\tau_i) \\mapsto \\tau_i(\\sqrt{p_i})/\\sqrt{p_i},$$ and then defining \n\\begin{align*}\n\\chi(\\tau)&=\\chi(\\tau_1^{a_1}\\circ \\cdots \\circ \\tau_n^{a_n})\\\\\n&=(\\chi(\\tau_1^{a_1}),\\ldots,\\chi(\\tau_n^{a_n})).\n\\end{align*}\nOnce we show this map is injective we are done, as any injective map between finite sets of the same cardinality is surjective. Assume $(a_1,\\ldots,a_n)=(b_1,\\ldots,b_n)$. Then clearly $\\tau_1^{a_1}\\circ \\cdots\\circ \\tau_n^{a_n}=\\tau_1^{b_1}\\circ \\cdots \\circ \\tau_n^{b_n}$, since $a_i=b_i$ for all $i$. Now, $\\{\\pm 1\\}$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, as the map $\\varphi: \\{\\pm 1\\} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ by $\\varphi(-1)=1$ and $\\varphi(1)=0$ is an injective homormorphism. Therefore $$\\operatorname{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})\\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^n.$$ Attempted proof of Martin Brandenburg's Claim: Claim: For all $i<n$ and $i<k_1<\\ldots<k_s\\leq n$, $\\sqrt{p_{k_1}\\ldots p_{k_s}} \\not \\in Q_i$. Proceed by induction on $n$. If $i=0$, then we must show that $\\sqrt{p_{k_1}\\ldots p_{k_s}} \\not \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, where $0<k_1<\\ldots<k_s\\leq n$. This is equivalent to showing that $p_{k_1}\\ldots p_{k_s}$ is not a square, which is clear since $p_{k_1}, \\ldots ,p_{k_s}$ are prime numbers. Assume the result is true for all $i<n-1$ and consider $i=n-1$. We need to show $\\sqrt{p_n}\\not \\in Q_{n-1}$. Assume the contrary, that $\\sqrt{p_n} \\in Q_{n-1}$. Then $$\\sqrt{p_n}=\\sum_{(\\alpha_1,...,\\alpha_{n-1})} a_{(\\alpha_1,...,\\alpha_{n-1})} \\sqrt{{p_1}^{\\alpha_1} \\ldots p_{n-1}^{\\alpha_{n-1}}}, \\quad \\dagger$$ where $\\alpha_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$ and $a_{(\\alpha_1,...,\\alpha_{n-1})}\\in \\mathbb{Q}$. Multiplying both sides of $(\\dagger)$ by $\\sqrt{p_n}$ gives $$p_n=\\sum_{(\\alpha_1,...,\\alpha_{n-1})} a_{(\\alpha_1,...,\\alpha_{n-1})} \\sqrt{{p_1}^{\\alpha_1} \\ldots p_{n-1}^{\\alpha_{n-1}}p_n},$$ contradicting the fact $\\sqrt{{p_1}^{\\alpha_1} \\ldots p_{n-1}^{\\alpha_{n-1}}p_n} \\not \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. Therefore $\\sqrt{p_n} \\not \\in Q_{n-1}$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The crucial point is: It is not trivial at all to see that $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{p_1},\\dotsc,\\sqrt{p_n})$ has degree exactly $2^n$ (only $\\leq 2^n$ is clear) over $\\mathbb{Q}$, or equivalently, that $p_i \\notin \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{p_1},\\dotsc,\\sqrt{p_{i-1}})$ for all $i \\leq n$. Here is what you can do: Let $m_1,\\dotsc,m_r$ be coprime and square free numbers $>1$ (for example distinct primes). Then I claim that $K_r := \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{m_1},\\dotsc,\\sqrt{m_r})$ has degree $2^r$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. It is enough to prove $\\sqrt{m_{i+1}} \\notin K_i$ for all $i < r$. But it turns out one should show something stronger: For $i<r$ and $i < j_1 < \\dotsc < j_s \\leq r$ we have $\\sqrt{m_{j_1} \\cdot \\dotsc \\cdot m_{j_s}} \\notin K_i$. Now this can be shown by induction on $i$; I leave it for you as an exercise. Now the rest is easy: $K_r$ is the splitting field of $(x^2-m_1) \\cdot \\cdots \\cdot (x^2-m_r)$, hence normal, and everything in characteristic $0$ is separable. Thus $K_r$ is Galois over $\\mathbb{Q}$; let $G$ be the Galois group. Since the conjugates of $\\sqrt{m_i}$ are $\\pm \\sqrt{m_i}$, there is a homomorphism $\\alpha : G \\to \\{\\pm 1\\}^r$ given by $\\alpha(g) \\sqrt{m_i} = g(\\sqrt{m_i})$. Clearly it is injective. Since $G$ has order $2^r$, it is also surjective. Thus we have an isomorphism $G \\cong \\{\\pm 1\\}^r$. Explicitly, the Galois automorphisms are exactly as you've described them, they are given by $\\sqrt{m_i} \\mapsto \\varepsilon_i \\sqrt{m_i}$, where $\\varepsilon_i = \\pm 1$. Remark: There are shorter proofs, using Kummer Theory.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this problem. The user is asking about whether the τ_i's generate the Galois group of K over Q, where K is Q adjoined with square roots of distinct primes. The main goal is to show that the Galois group is isomorphic to (Z/2Z)^n. \n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions in the problem. The original question mentions that K is Q(√p₁,…,√pₙ), and they want to show that K/Q is Galois with Galois group (Z/2Z)^n. The user's proof attempts to show this by constructing automorphisms τ_i that flip the sign of each √p_i and argues that these generate the Galois group.\n\nLooking at the assumptions: The primes p₁,…,pₙ are distinct. Each extension Q_i/Q_{i-1} is degree 2 because √p_i is not in Q_{i-1}. The minimal polynomial for each √p_i is X² - p_i, which is separable. The field K is the splitting field of the product of these quadratics, hence Galois. The degree of the extension is 2ⁿ, so the Galois group has order 2ⁿ. The automorphisms are determined by their action on the square roots, each can be sent to ± themselves. The τ_i are defined as flipping the sign of √p_i and fixing others. The user claims these generate the Galois group, hence it's isomorphic to (Z/2Z)^n.\n\nSo the key assumptions here would be: the primes are distinct, each quadratic extension is degree 2, the field is a splitting field of a separable polynomial (hence Galois), the degree is 2ⁿ, and each automorphism is determined by flipping signs of the generators. Also, the τ_i generate the Galois group. \n\nWait, but the problem statement in the original question is to show that K/Q is Galois with Galois group (Z/2Z)^n. The user's specific question is whether the τ_i generate the Galois group. So the assumptions would be the conditions given in the problem, not the steps in the proof. The problem states K is Q(√p₁,…,√pₙ) with p_i distinct primes. The user's proof uses that the primes are distinct, which ensures that each √p_i is not in the previous fields, hence each extension is degree 2, leading to the total degree 2ⁿ. The minimal polynomials are separable, so K is Galois. Then, the Galois group is generated by the automorphisms τ_i which flip each √p_i. \n\nSo, for the assumptions section, we need to list all the given conditions. The problem states: Let K = Q(√p₁,…,√pₙ). The primes p₁,…,pₙ are distinct. They are primes, so they are not squares. The problem requires showing K/Q is Galois with Galois group (Z/2Z)^n. The user's approach uses the tower of extensions, each of degree 2, and constructs the automorphisms. So the assumptions are that each p_i is a distinct prime, K is the compositum of Q(√p₁),…,Q(√pₙ), each √p_i is not in Q or in the previous fields. So the key assumptions would be:\n\n- p₁, p₂, ..., p_n are distinct primes.\n- K is the field extension of Q obtained by adjoining √p₁, √p₂, ..., √pₙ.\n- For each i, √p_i is not in Q(√p₁, ..., √p_{i-1}).\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't explicitly state the last point; that's part of the user's proof. The problem's original statement just says \"Let K = Q(√p₁,…,√pₙ)\", and the user's proof argues that each √p_i is not in the previous field. So perhaps the problem's assumptions are that the p_i are distinct primes, and K is constructed as such. The user then uses the fact that distinct primes ensure that each √p_i is not in the prior fields. So the assumptions should be the ones given in the problem statement, not the ones derived in the proof. The problem says \"Let K = Q(√p₁,…,√pₙ)\" and asks to show K/Q is Galois with Galois group (Z/2Z)^n. So the assumptions are:\n\n- K is the field extension of Q generated by √p₁, √p₂, ..., √pₙ.\n- Each p_i is a distinct prime number.\n- The extension K/Q is to be considered.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't mention any conditions on the p_i other than being primes and distinct. The user's proof uses the fact that primes are not squares, hence their square roots generate degree 2 extensions. So the assumptions in the problem as posed (before the user's proof) are:\n\n- p₁, p₂, ..., p_n are distinct primes.\n- K = Q(√p₁, √p₂, ..., √pₙ).\n\nTherefore, when structuring the problem, the assumptions should list each p_i as a distinct prime, and K is the field obtained by adjoining their square roots to Q. Each assumption should address one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\nEach p_i is a prime number,\np_1, p_2, ..., p_n are distinct,\nK is the field extension of Q generated by √p_1, √p_2, ..., √p_n.\n\nProblem:\nShow that K/Q is a Galois extension with Galois group isomorphic to (Z/2Z)^n.\n\nWait, but in the example provided by the user, the assumptions were \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Each line is a single condition on one object. So here, each line should be a separate assumption. So:\n\nAssumption:\np_1, p_2, ..., p_n are prime numbers,\np_1, p_2, ..., p_n are distinct,\nK is the field extension of Q generated by √p_1, √p_2, ..., √p_n.\n\nProblem:\nProve that K/Q is Galois with Galois group (Z/2Z)^n.\n\nYes, that seems to capture the given conditions. The fact that primes are distinct and not squares is part of why the extensions are degree 2, but the problem itself states those primes are distinct. The user's proof then uses those assumptions to show the required result. So in the formatted problem, the assumptions are the given conditions, and the problem is to prove the Galois group structure.",
