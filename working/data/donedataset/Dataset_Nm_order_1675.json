    "Content": "So I'm pondering the statement: Show that a continuous linear functional $f$ on a subspace $V$ of a Hilbert space $H$ has a unique norm preserving extension $h$ on $H$ Here is my thought. Consider the closure of $V$, $\\overline{V}$. Then since $V$ is dense in $\\overline{V}$, there exists a unique extension $\\overline{f}$ of $f$ to $\\overline{V}$. Moreover since $\\overline{V}$ is a closed subspace of $H$ then it is also a Hilbert space, so by the Frechet-Riesz theorem we have $\\overline{f}(v)$ = $\\langle v,y_{\\space\\overline{f}} \\rangle$ for some unique element $y_{\\space\\overline{f}} \\in \\overline{V}$ Take $ h(x) = \\langle x,y_{\\space\\overline{f}} \\rangle$. How do I get uniqueness though?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let me simplify things by assuming (as you point out, without loss of generality) that $V$ is closed. Then, indeed, $f(x) = \\langle x,y \\rangle$ on $V$ for a unique $y \\in V$, yielding the immediate extension $h(x) := \\langle x,y\\rangle$ of $f$ to $H$; one can readily check that $$\\|f\\|_{V^\\ast} = \\|y\\|_V = \\|y\\|_H = \\|h\\|_{H^\\ast},$$ so that this extension is norm-preserving. Now, suppose that $k \\in H^\\ast$ is another extension of $f$ to $H$, so that $k(x) = \\langle x,z\\rangle$ for a unique $z \\in H$. Then for any $x \\in V$, $$0 = f(x) - f(x) = h(x) - k(x) = \\langle x,y\\rangle - \\langle x,z\\rangle = \\langle x,y-z\\rangle,$$ so that $y-z \\in V^\\perp$. Hence, $y$ and $y-z$ are orthogonal, so that\n$$\\|k\\|_{H^\\ast} = \\|z\\|_H = \\|y - (y-z)\\|_H = \\sqrt{\\|y\\|^2_H + \\|y-z\\|^2_H}.$$ Thus, $\\|k\\|_{H^\\ast} = \\|f\\|_{V^\\ast}$ if and only if $\\sqrt{\\|y\\|^2_H + \\|y-z\\|^2_H} = \\|y\\|_H$, if and only if $\\|y-z\\| = 0$, if and only if $y =z$, if and only if $h=k$. Hence, $h$ is indeed the unique norm-preserving extension.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's break down the problem. The user wants to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The task is to list assumptions and then the problem statement.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the key elements of the problem. The original question is about proving that a continuous linear functional on a subspace of a Hilbert space has a unique norm-preserving extension to the entire space. \n\nLooking at the user's example, the assumptions are specific conditions applied to one object each. In the example, they listed that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, the problem involves Hilbert spaces, continuous linear functionals, subspaces, and extensions.\n\nThe assumptions here would likely be:\n- The space H is a Hilbert space. (This is given in the problem statement.)\n- V is a subspace of H. (Explicitly mentioned.)\n- f is a continuous linear functional on V. (Stated in the problem.)\n- The extension h must be norm-preserving. (Part of the problem's requirement.)\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumptions included conditions on n, which were part of the problem's setup. Similarly, here, the setup includes H being a Hilbert space, V a subspace, f a continuous linear functional on V. The problem is to show the existence and uniqueness of the norm-preserving extension h on H.\n\nHowever, the user's example included both the general condition (n is an integer) and a specific one (n divisible by 7). In the current problem, the Hilbert space H, subspace V, and functional f's continuity and linearity are all part of the problem's setup. The unique norm-preserving extension is the actual problem to solve.\n\nSo the assumptions should list all the given conditions. Each assumption should be a single condition applied to one object. Let me list them:\n\nAssumption:\n- H is a Hilbert space.\n- V is a subspace of H.\n- f is a continuous linear functional on V.\n- The extension h must be norm-preserving.\n\nWait, but the norm-preserving is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. The problem is to show that such an h exists and is unique. So maybe the assumptions are only the given conditions, and the problem includes the requirement of norm preservation.\n\nWait the original problem says: \"Show that a continuous linear functional f on a subspace V of a Hilbert space H has a unique norm preserving extension h on H\". So the problem is to show existence and uniqueness. The assumptions here are the conditions given: H is a Hilbert space, V is a subspace, f is a continuous linear functional on V. The requirement is that the extension h is norm-preserving (i.e., ||h|| = ||f||) and unique.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- H is a Hilbert space.\n- V is a subspace of H.\n- f is a continuous linear functional on V.\n\nThe problem is to prove that there exists a unique norm-preserving extension h of f to H.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have those three assumptions, each as a separate line, and the problem statement as given.\n\nNow checking the example again, in the example, the assumptions were \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But in the original problem, the user had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem included \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption? Wait no, in the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, the assumption was n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should just be that n is an integer, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. But in the example, the formatted problem includes \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which is not part of the original problem. That suggests that perhaps the example might have an error. Wait, maybe the original problem had a different condition, but the user made a mistake in their example? Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a condition that n is divisible by 7, but the user's original problem statement didn't include that. Wait, let me check again:\n\nThe example's original problem is:\n\nProve that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut the formatted problem's assumptions are:\n\nn is an integer,\n\nn is divisible by 7.\n\nBut that's conflicting because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so there's no restriction that n is divisible by 7. The example seems to have an error here. So perhaps the user's example is incorrect. Therefore, when applying the format, I need to make sure that the assumptions are correctly extracted from the problem, not introducing new conditions.\n\nBut given that, perhaps in the example, the user intended to have a problem where n is divisible by 7, but in their original problem statement, it's written as \"for every integer n\". That's a mistake. But regardless, when structuring the current problem, I should follow the correct method.\n\nSo back to the current problem. The original question is:\n\n\"Show that a continuous linear functional f on a subspace V of a Hilbert space H has a unique norm preserving extension h on H\"\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n- H is a Hilbert space.\n\n- V is a subspace of H.\n\n- f is a continuous linear functional on V.\n\nThe problem is to show the existence and uniqueness of a norm-preserving extension h on H.\n\nHence, the formatted problem should have those three assumptions, each on a separate line, and the problem statement as given.",
