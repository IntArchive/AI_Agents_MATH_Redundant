    "Content": "Can you help me to prove that $$(x+y)^n\\leq 2^{n-1}(x^n+y^n)$$ for $n\\ge1$ and $x,y\\ge0$. I tried by induction, but I didn't get a result.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Look. I also have tried to do it by induction. It is obvious that it holds for $n=1$ and $n=2$. Assume that it also holds for $n$. Let's prove that inequality for $n+1$:\n$$\n2^n(x^{n+1} + y^{n+1}) - (x+y)^{n+1} = 2^{n}(x^{n+1} + y^{n+1}) -(x+y)^n(x+y)\\geq 2^n(x^{n+1} + y^{n+1}) - 2^{n-1}(x^n + y^n)(x+y) = \n2^{n-1}(x^{n+1} + y^{n+1} - x^ny - y^nx) = 2^{n-1}(y(y^n - x^n) + x(x^n - y^n))=\n2^{n-1}(y^n-x^n)(y-x) = 2^{n-1}(y-x)^2(y^{n-1}+xy^{n-2}+x^2y^{n-2}+\\dots+y^2x^{n-2} + x^{n-1}) \\geq 0. \n$$ \nSo we have proved that $2^n(x^{n+1} + y^{n+1}) - (x+y)^{n+1} \\geq 0$. It is similar to $(x+y)^{n+1} \\leq 2^n(x^{n+1} + y^{n+1})$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants to prove that for any non-negative real numbers x and y, and for any integer n ≥ 1, the inequality (x + y)^n ≤ 2^{n-1}(x^n + y^n) holds. They mentioned trying induction but not getting the result, so maybe induction isn't the easiest approach here. Let me think about other methods.\n\nFirst, I remember that inequalities like this often relate to convex functions or maybe using the AM-GM inequality. Wait, another idea: maybe Hölder's inequality or Jensen's inequality? Let's consider Jensen since it deals with convex functions and averages. The function f(t) = t^n is convex for t ≥ 0 when n ≥ 1 because the second derivative is non-negative. \n\nJensen's inequality states that for a convex function f, f((a + b)/2) ≤ (f(a) + f(b))/2. If I apply this to x and y, then ((x + y)/2)^n ≤ (x^n + y^n)/2. Multiplying both sides by 2^n would give (x + y)^n ≤ 2^{n-1}(x^n + y^n), which is exactly the inequality we need to prove. So that seems like a straightforward approach using Jensen's inequality. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using the binomial expansion? Let's see. Expanding (x + y)^n gives a sum of terms like C(n,k) x^{k} y^{n-k}. Each term here is non-negative since x and y are non-negative. But comparing this to 2^{n-1}(x^n + y^n) isn't immediately obvious. However, note that the maximum term in the expansion might be related. Wait, but if we use the convexity argument, it's much cleaner.\n\nAnother approach could be to consider symmetry. Without loss of generality, assume x ≥ y. Then perhaps set t = y/x (if x ≠ 0), so the inequality becomes (1 + t)^n ≤ 2^{n-1}(1 + t^n). Then we can analyze this function for t in [0,1]. Taking the ratio (1 + t)^n / (1 + t^n) and showing it's ≤ 2^{n-1}. Maybe take derivatives to check maximums? But this might be more involved than Jensen's.\n\nWait, let's verify with n=1. Then the inequality is (x + y) ≤ 2^{0}(x + y) = x + y, which holds as equality. For n=2, (x + y)^2 ≤ 2(x^2 + y^2). Expanding left side: x² + 2xy + y² ≤ 2x² + 2y² ⇒ 2xy ≤ x² + y², which is true since (x - y)^2 ≥ 0. So that works. For n=3, maybe similar? But induction step isn't straightforward. Suppose it holds for n=k, can we show for n=k+1? Let's see: (x + y)^{k+1} = (x + y)(x + y)^k ≤ (x + y)2^{k-1}(x^k + y^k). Then we need to show that (x + y)(x^k + y^k) ≤ 2^{k}(x^{k+1} + y^{k+1}). Hmm, not sure if that's directly possible. Maybe induction isn't the best path here.\n\nBack to Jensen's. Since f(t) = t^n is convex for n ≥ 1, then the inequality ((x + y)/2)^n ≤ (x^n + y^n)/2. Multiply both sides by 2^n: (x + y)^n ≤ 2^{n} * (x^n + y^n)/2 = 2^{n-1}(x^n + y^n). Exactly the desired inequality. So that's a valid proof. Therefore, the key assumption here is the convexity of t^n for n ≥ 1, which holds because the second derivative is n(n-1)t^{n-2} ≥ 0 for t ≥ 0 and n ≥ 1.\n\nWait, but the original problem states x,y ≥0 and n ≥1. So the assumptions are x and y are non-negative, n is an integer greater or equal to 1. But in the example given in the format, the assumption included that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the original problem. But in this problem, the user didn't specify any additional constraints beyond what's in the problem statement. So the assumptions should be x and y are non-negative real numbers, n is an integer greater than or equal to 1. Each of these is a separate assumption.\n\nTherefore, when structuring the problem as per the user's format, the assumptions are:\n\n- x is a non-negative real number,\n- y is a non-negative real number,\n- n is an integer,\n- n is greater than or equal to 1.\n\nThen the problem is to prove the given inequality.",
