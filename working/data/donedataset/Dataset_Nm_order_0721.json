    "Content": "Am I correct or not? I think that a ring of holomorphic functions in one variable is not a UFD , because there are holomorphic functions with an infinite number of $0$'s, and hence it will have an infinite number of irreducible factors! But I am unable to get a concrete example. Please give some example.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You are perfectly right: the ring of entire functions $\\mathcal O(\\mathbb C)$ is not a UFD. Here is why: In a UFD a non-zero element has only finitely many irreducible (=prime) divisors and this does not hold  for our ring $\\mathcal O(\\mathbb C)$. Indeed the only primes in $\\mathcal O(\\mathbb C)$ are the affine functions $z-a$ and on the other hand the function $\\sin(z)$ is divided by the infinitely many primes  $z-k\\pi\\; (k\\in \\mathbb Z) $. The same proof shows that for an arbitrary domain $D$ the ring $\\mathcal O(D)$ is not a UFD, once you know Weierstrass's theorem which implies that there exist non identically zero holomorphic functions in $D$ with infinitely many zeros. NB It is sufficient for the proof above to show that the $z-a$ are irreducible in $\\mathcal O(\\mathbb C)$ (you don't need that there are no other irreducibles). And that is easy: if $a=0$ for example, write $z=fg$ and you will see that $f$ (say) has no zero and is thus a unit $f\\in \\mathcal O(\\mathbb C)^*$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to know if the ring of holomorphic functions in one variable is not a UFD, and they're asking for a concrete example. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what a UFD is. A unique factorization domain requires that every element can be written as a product of irreducible elements, and this factorization is unique up to units and order. In the ring of holomorphic functions, the units are the functions that never vanish, right? Because if a holomorphic function has no zeros, it's invertible in the ring.\n\nNow, the user's argument is that since some holomorphic functions have infinitely many zeros, they might have infinitely many irreducible factors. For example, consider a function like sin(z), which has zeros at all integer multiples of π. Each zero corresponds to a factor of (z - nπ), but in the ring of holomorphic functions, each of these linear factors is irreducible. However, in reality, you can't factor sin(z) into a product of infinitely many linear terms because the ring only allows finite products. So maybe the issue is that you can't represent such functions as finite products of irreducibles, which would violate the UFD condition.\n\nWait, but in complex analysis, entire functions with infinitely many zeros can be expressed as infinite products (like the Weierstrass factorization theorem), but those are infinite products, which aren't allowed in ring theory's factorization into irreducibles. So in the ring of holomorphic functions, such a function can't be expressed as a finite product of irreducibles, hence the ring isn't a UFD. \n\nThe user is asking for a concrete example. Let's take sin(z). If we try to factor it in the ring of holomorphic functions, each zero at z = nπ would correspond to a factor (z - nπ), but since there are infinitely many zeros, you can't write sin(z) as a finite product of these irreducibles. Therefore, sin(z) would require infinitely many irreducible factors, which is impossible in a UFD where factorizations must be finite. Hence, the ring isn't a UFD.\n\nAnother example could be the function e^z - 1, but wait, that has zeros at 2πi n for integers n, so similar issue. However, maybe sin(z) is a more standard example. So the example would be a function with infinitely many zeros, like sin(z), which cannot be factored into a finite product of irreducibles, hence the ring isn't a UFD.\n\nBut wait, in the ring of holomorphic functions, can you even factor out one zero? Like, if you have a function f(z) with a zero at z=a, you can write f(z) = (z - a)g(z), where g(z) is holomorphic. But for functions with infinitely many zeros, you can't do this finitely. So the existence of such functions shows that the ring isn't Noetherian either, but that's a separate issue. The key point here is the failure of unique factorization due to infinite zeros.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be about the ring in question (holomorphic functions in one variable), and the problem is to show it's not a UFD by providing an example. The user's own reasoning is that infinitely many zeros lead to infinitely many irreducible factors, but needs a concrete example. So the formatted problem should capture the essential assumption and the problem request.",
