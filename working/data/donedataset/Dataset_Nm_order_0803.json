    "Content": "I've just happened to read this question on MO (that of course has been closed) and some of the answers to a similar question on MSE. I know almost nothing of nonstandard analysis and was asking myself if something like the sentence « $1- 0.999 \\dots$ is a nonzero positive infinitesimal» could be easily expressed and proved in nonstandard analysis. First of all, what is 0.999... ? If we take the usual definition as a series or as a limit of a sequence of rationals, then it will still be a real number and equal to $1$ (I guess by \"transfer principle\", but please correct me if I'm wrong). Instead, let's define $$0.9_N:=\\sum_{i=1}^N 9\\cdot 10^{-i} $$ where $N\\in{}^*\\mathbb{N}\\setminus\\mathbb{N}$ is an infinite nonstandard natural number. This $0.9_N$ is a legitimate element of ${}^*\\mathbb{R}$, expressed as $0.$ followed by an infinite number of \"$9$\" digits. What can be said about $\\epsilon_N:=1-0.9_N$ ? Is there an elementary proof that $\\epsilon_N$ is a positive infinitesimal of ${}^*\\mathbb{R}$ ? (by \"elementary\" I mean just order and field axioms and the intuitive facts about infinitesimals, like that for $x$ infinite $1/x$ is infinitesimal etc.; no nonprincipal ultrafilters & C).",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "We can use the geometric series formula: $$0.9_N = \\sum_{i=1}^N 9 \\cdot 10^{-i} = 9 \\cdot 10^{-1} \\cdot \\frac{1 - 10^{-N}}{1 - 10^{-1}}  = (1 - 10^{-N})$$ Since $N$ is infinite, $\\epsilon_N = 10^{-N} = 1 / 10^N$ is infinitesimal.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to break down this problem step by step. The user is asking about whether 1 minus 0.999... with an infinite number of 9s is a positive infinitesimal in the context of nonstandard analysis. They mentioned defining 0.9_N as a sum from i=1 to N of 9*10^{-i}, where N is an infinite nonstandard natural number. They want an elementary proof that ε_N = 1 - 0.9_N is a positive infinitesimal using basic axioms and properties of nonstandard analysis.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the key assumptions here. The original problem has a few components: the definition of 0.9_N, the nature of N, and the properties of ε_N. Let me list each assumption one by one. \n\n1. The definition of 0.9_N is given as a sum from i=1 to N of 9*10^{-i}. So this is a finite sum but with N being an infinite nonstandard natural number. \n\n2. N is specified to be in *N \\ N, which means it's an element of the nonstandard extension of natural numbers but not a standard natural number. So N is infinite.\n\n3. ε_N is defined as 1 - 0.9_N. The user wants to prove ε_N is a positive infinitesimal in *R.\n\nNow, considering nonstandard analysis, we know that for an infinite hypernatural N, the sum 0.9_N would be infinitely close to 1. The difference ε_N should therefore be infinitesimal. But how to show that using elementary properties?\n\nLet me recall that in nonstandard analysis, a number is infinitesimal if its absolute value is less than every positive standard real number. So we need to show that ε_N is positive and that for any standard positive real r, ε_N < r.\n\nCalculating ε_N: 1 - sum_{i=1}^N 9*10^{-i}. Let's compute this sum. The sum from i=1 to N of 9*10^{-i} is a geometric series. The standard sum to n terms is 1 - 10^{-n}, right? Because sum_{i=1}^n 9*10^{-i} = 0.9 + 0.09 + ... + 9*10^{-n} = 1 - 10^{-n}. But here, N is infinite. So in the nonstandard case, sum_{i=1}^N 9*10^{-i} = 1 - 10^{-N} (by transfer principle, since the formula holds for all standard n). Therefore, ε_N = 1 - (1 - 10^{-N}) = 10^{-N}.\n\nNow, 10^{-N} where N is an infinite hypernatural. Since N is infinite, 10^{-N} is 1 divided by an infinite hyperreal, which should be infinitesimal. But to confirm this, we can note that for any standard natural number k, N > k (since N is infinite), so 10^{-N} < 10^{-k}. Since 10^{-k} can be made arbitrarily small for standard k, 10^{-N} is less than any positive standard real, hence infinitesimal. Also, since N is positive, 10^{-N} is positive. Therefore, ε_N is a positive infinitesimal.\n\nBut the user mentioned using \"elementary\" methods without ultrafilters, so maybe just leveraging the properties of hyperreals, like if x is infinite, 1/x is infinitesimal. Here, 10^N is infinite because N is infinite, so 1/(10^N) is infinitesimal. Therefore, ε_N = 10^{-N} is infinitesimal and positive. That seems straightforward. So the key steps are recognizing the sum as 1 - 10^{-N}, then using that N is infinite to conclude 10^{-N} is infinitesimal.\n\nNow, structuring the problem according to the required format. The assumptions need to be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition. The problem statement is to prove ε_N is a positive infinitesimal.\n\nAssumptions would include:\n\n- N is an element of *N \\ N (so it's an infinite nonstandard natural number).\n\n- 0.9_N is defined as sum_{i=1}^N 9*10^{-i}.\n\n- ε_N is defined as 1 - 0.9_N.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. Then the problem is to prove ε_N is a positive infinitesimal in *R.",
