    "Content": "Two points $(c, d, e),(x, y, z) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ , we say that the midpoint of these two points is the point with coordinates $\\left(\\frac{c+x}{2}\n,\n\\frac{d+y}{2}\n,\n\\frac{e+z}{2}\\right)$ Take any set $S$ of nine points from $\\mathbb{R}^3$ with integer coordinates. Prove that there must be at least one pair of points\n  in $S$ whose midpoint also has integer coordinates. I've tried to do an example with set $$S=\\{(2,2,2),(1,8,2),(3,4,5),(5,2,2),(4,2,9),\\\\(2,1,4),(6,8,2),(0,0,0),(5,2,3)\\}$$ So taking $2$ points, $(3,4,5)$ and $(5,2,3)$ so $(3+5)/2=4$ , $(4+2)/2=3$ , $(5+3)/2 = 4$ , which are integers. I'm wanting this argument to hold in general and I'm finding it tricky to prove this does anyone have suggestions would be grateful!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Just to reiterate what I said earlier, if we list the possible coordinate parities of the $3$ -tuples, we have $$\\{(e,e,e),(e,e,o),(e,o,e),(e,o,o),(o,e,e),(o,e,o),(o,o,e),(o,o,o)\\}$$ So there are $8$ different parity $3$ -tuples possible.  Also note the addition of even and odd integers; $$e+e=e,$$ $$o+o=e,$$ $$e+o=o$$ So in order for your midpoint to be an integer, we need to have the points being added to have coordinates of the same parity.  Therefore, since we have 9 points, assuming our first 8 points are all of different parity combinations as above, the 9th must be one of these 8 possibilities.  If you add up the two points that have the same coordinate parity structure, this will yield an even number, which is divisible by 2.  For example, if both ordered triples have coordinate parity structure $(e,e,o)$ , then by the midpoint formula, $$Mid((e,e,o),(e,e,o))=\\left(\\frac{e+e}{2}, \\frac{e+e}{2},\\frac{o+o}{2}\\right)=\\left(\\frac{2e}{2}, \\frac{2e}{2},\\frac{2o}{2}\\right)=(e,e,o)$$ And so by the Pigeonhole principle, there is at least 1 midpoint that contains integer coordinates.  And as Robert Z noted in his solutions, this can be extended to $n$ -tuples as well.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The question is about proving that any set of nine points in R^3 with integer coordinates must have at least one pair whose midpoint also has integer coordinates. The user provided an example where such a pair exists, and they're looking for a general proof. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what the midpoint means. The midpoint of two points (c, d, e) and (x, y, z) is ((c+x)/2, (d+y)/2, (e+z)/2). For this midpoint to have integer coordinates, each of these averages must be integers. That means, for each coordinate, the sum of the corresponding coordinates of the two points must be even. Because if c + x is even, then (c + x)/2 is an integer, same for the other coordinates.\n\nSo, for two points to have a midpoint with integer coordinates, all three coordinates must satisfy that their sums are even. That is, c and x must have the same parity (both even or both odd), d and y must have the same parity, and e and z must have the same parity. \n\nThis makes me think of parity in each coordinate. Each coordinate can be either even or odd, so for each point, its parity in each of the three coordinates can be represented as a 3-tuple of 0s and 1s, where 0 represents even and 1 represents odd. For example, a point (2,3,4) would have parities (0,1,0).\n\nNow, the number of possible parity combinations is 2^3 = 8. Each point falls into one of these 8 parity classes. So, if we have 9 points, by the pigeonhole principle, at least two of them must be in the same parity class. Because 9 points into 8 classes means one class must have at least two points. \n\nIf two points are in the same parity class, then for each coordinate, their parities are the same. Therefore, when you add the coordinates, each sum is even (since even + even = even and odd + odd = even). Therefore, each component of the midpoint will be an integer. So, those two points will have a midpoint with integer coordinates.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user didn't mention any restrictions on the parity. The key here is that we need to map each point to its parity class (i.e., the combination of parities in each coordinate). Since there are 8 possible classes, 9 points must have at least two in the same class. Then those two points will have all coordinate sums even, leading to an integer midpoint.\n\nTherefore, the core idea is the pigeonhole principle applied to parity classes in three dimensions. Each parity class is a \"box,\" and with 9 points, one box must contain at least two points. Those two points satisfy the required condition.\n\nLet me check the example provided by the user. The points (3,4,5) and (5,2,3). Let's see their parities:\n\n3 is odd, 4 is even, 5 is odd. So parity (1,0,1).\n\n5 is odd, 2 is even, 3 is odd. So parity (1,0,1). Same parity class. Therefore, their sums: 3+5=8 (even), 4+2=6 (even), 5+3=8 (even). Midpoint (4,3,4), which are integers. That checks out.\n\nSo the general proof would be: there are 2^3 = 8 parity classes. With 9 points, two must share the same parity class, leading to their midpoint having integer coordinates. Therefore, the problem is a direct application of the pigeonhole principle based on coordinate parities.\n\nBut let me make sure there's no missing assumption. The problem states \"any set S of nine points from R^3 with integer coordinates.\" So the assumptions are:\n\n- Each point in S has integer coordinates in all three dimensions.\n\n- The set S has exactly nine points.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that at least one pair in S has a midpoint with integer coordinates.\n\nSo structuring the problem according to the required format:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- Each point in set S is an element of R^3.\n\n- Each coordinate of every point in S is an integer.\n\n- The set S contains exactly nine points.\n\nProblem: Prove that there must be at least one pair of points in S whose midpoint also has integer coordinates.\n\nThis matches the problem as given. The key here is that the user didn't explicitly state the number of parity classes, but the pigeonhole principle applies because 9 points exceed the 8 possible parity combinations. Therefore, the formatted problem would list the assumptions as each point having integer coordinates and the set size being nine, then the problem is to prove the existence of such a pair.",
