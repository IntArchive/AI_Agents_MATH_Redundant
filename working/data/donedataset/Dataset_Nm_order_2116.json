    "Content": "Here is a statement that seems prima facie obvious, but when I try to prove it, I am lost. Let $x_1 , x_2, \\dots, x_k$ be complex numbers satisfying: $$x_1 + x_2+ \\dots + x_k = 0$$ $$x_1^2 + x_2^2+ \\dots + x_k^2 = 0$$ $$x_1^3 + x_2^3+ \\dots + x_k^3 = 0$$ $$\\dots$$ Then $x_1 = x_2 = \\dots = x_k = 0$ . The statement seems obvious because we have more than $k$ constraints (constraints that are in some sense, \"independent\") on $k$ variables, so they should determine the variables uniquely.  But my attempts so far of formalizing this intuition have failed.  So, how do you prove this statement?  Is there a generalization of my intuition?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "For a slightly different method than Potato's second answer (but the idea is mainly the same): Without loss of generality, the system of equations can be written as: $$\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{lcl} \\lambda_1x_1 + \\lambda_2x_2+ \\dots + \\lambda_k x_k &= &0 \\\\ \\lambda_1x_1^2 + \\lambda_2x_2^2+ \\dots + \\lambda_k x_k^2 & = & 0 \\\\ & \\vdots & \\\\ \\lambda_1x_1^k + \\lambda_2x_2^k+ \\dots + \\lambda_k x_k^k & = & 0 \\end{array} \\right.$$ where $\\lambda_i>0$ , $x_i \\neq 0$ and $x_i \\neq x_j$ for $i \\neq j$ . Indeed, if $x_i=x_j$ replace $x_i+x_j$ with $2x_i$ and if $x_i=0$ just remove it. By contradiction, suppose $k \\geq 1$ . Now, the family $\\{ (\\lambda_1 x_1^j, \\dots , \\lambda_k x_k^j) \\mid 1 \\leq j \\leq k \\}$ cannot be linearly independent since the vector space $\\{(y_1,\\dots, y_k) \\mid y_1+ \\dots+ y_k=0 \\}$ has dimension $k-1$ (it is a hyperplane). Therefore, the matrix $$A:=\\left( \\begin{matrix} \\lambda_1x_1 &  \\lambda_2x_2 & \\dots & \\lambda_k x_k  \\\\ \\lambda_1x_1^2 & \\lambda_2x_2^2 & \\dots & \\lambda_k x_k^2  \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & & \\vdots  \\\\ \\lambda_1x_1^k & \\lambda_2x_2^k & \\dots & \\lambda_k x_k^k  \\end{matrix} \\right)$$ is not invertible.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The problem states that if we have complex numbers x₁, x₂, ..., xₖ such that the sum of their nth powers is zero for all positive integers n, then each xᵢ must be zero. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the given conditions. The key point is that the sums are zero for all exponents n ≥ 1. That seems really strong because each equation adds a new condition. Normally, with k variables, you might expect that k equations would suffice to determine them, but here there are infinitely many equations. However, these equations are not linear except for the first one. The rest are polynomial equations of higher degrees.\n\nLet me start with a simpler case. Suppose k = 1. Then the equation would be x₁^n = 0 for all n ≥ 1. Well, if x₁ is non-zero, then x₁^n can't be zero for any n. So x₁ must be zero. That case is straightforward.\n\nNow, what if k = 2? Then we have x₁ + x₂ = 0, x₁² + x₂² = 0, x₁³ + x₂³ = 0, etc. From the first equation, x₂ = -x₁. Substitute into the second equation: x₁² + (-x₁)² = 2x₁² = 0 ⇒ x₁² = 0 ⇒ x₁ = 0. Then x₂ = 0 as well. So for k=2, it works.\n\nFor k=3, let's see. Suppose x₁ + x₂ + x₃ = 0. Then x₁² + x₂² + x₃² = 0. Maybe using Newton's identities? Because Newton's identities relate power sums to elementary symmetric sums. But the problem here is that we have all power sums equal to zero. If all the power sums p_n = x₁^n + x₂^n + ... + xₖ^n are zero, what does that imply about the roots?\n\nWait a minute, if we think of the variables x₁, x₂, ..., xₖ as roots of a polynomial. Let's suppose that the polynomial is P(t) = t^k + a_{k-1}t^{k-1} + ... + a₀. By Vieta's formula, the coefficients a_i are related to the elementary symmetric sums of the roots. But the power sums can be related to the coefficients via Newton's identities. However, if all power sums p_n = 0 for n ≥ 1, then using the generating function for power sums, we can consider that the generating function is G(t) = sum_{n=1}^∞ p_n t^{n-1} }.\n\nBut if all p_n are zero, then G(t) = 0. On the other hand, Newton's identities connect G(t) to the derivatives of the polynomial. Alternatively, if all the power sums are zero, then maybe the elementary symmetric sums are also zero? Wait, but for example, the first elementary symmetric sum is p₁ = 0. The second elementary symmetric sum can be written as (p₁² - p₂)/2, which would be (0 - 0)/2 = 0. Similarly, higher elementary symmetric sums would involve combinations of p_ns, which are all zero. Therefore, all elementary symmetric sums would be zero. Hence, the polynomial would be t^k, meaning all roots are zero. Therefore, x₁ = x₂ = ... = xₖ = 0.\n\nAh, that seems like a possible approach. Let me check that again.\n\nIf we have a polynomial whose roots are x₁, x₂, ..., xₖ. Then the elementary symmetric sums are the coefficients (up to sign). If all the power sums p_n = sum x_i^n = 0 for all n ≥ 1, then through Newton's identities, we can express each elementary symmetric sum in terms of the power sums. Since all p_n are zero, each elementary symmetric sum would be zero. For example:\n\nThe first elementary symmetric sum s₁ = x₁ + x₂ + ... + xₖ = p₁ = 0.\n\nThe second elementary symmetric sum s₂ = sum_{i < j} x_i x_j = (s₁² - p₂)/2 = (0 - 0)/2 = 0.\n\nThe third elementary symmetric sum s₃ = (s₁ s₂ - p₃)/3 + ... Wait, maybe I need to recall Newton's identities correctly.\n\nNewton's identities relate the power sums p₁, p₂, ..., p_k to the elementary symmetric sums s₁, s₂, ..., s_k. The formula is:\n\np_n = s₁ p_{n-1} - s₂ p_{n-2} + ... + (-1)^{k-1} s_k p_{n-k} }, for n ≥ 1.\n\nBut if all p_n = 0, then we can use induction to show that all s_i = 0. Let's try this for the first few terms.\n\nFor n = 1: p₁ = s₁ ⇒ s₁ = p₁ = 0.\n\nFor n = 2: p₂ = s₁ p₁ - 2 s₂ ⇒ 0 = 0 * 0 - 2 s₂ ⇒ s₂ = 0.\n\nFor n = 3: p₃ = s₁ p₂ - s₂ p₁ + 3 s₃ ⇒ 0 = 0*0 - 0*0 + 3 s₃ ⇒ s₃ = 0.\n\nContinuing this way, by induction, all s_i = 0. Therefore, the polynomial with roots x_i is t^k + 0 t^{k-1} + ... + 0 = t^k. Therefore, all roots x_i are zero. Hence, x₁ = x₂ = ... = xₖ = 0.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion holds. But wait, this requires that the number of variables k is finite. Because Newton's identities for a finite number of variables. So, as long as we have a finite k, then all the power sums being zero implies all elementary symmetric sums are zero, hence all roots are zero.\n\nSo, the problem's statement is proven by considering the polynomial whose roots are the x_i, applying Newton's identities, and deducing that all coefficients (elementary symmetric sums) are zero, leading to all roots being zero. Therefore, each x_i must be zero.\n\nBut let me check if there's another approach. Suppose there is a non-zero x_i. Let x_j be the non-zero with the largest absolute value (since we're dealing with complex numbers, absolute value is modulus). Let's say |x_j| is maximum. Then, consider the sum x₁^n + ... + x_k^n. As n tends to infinity, the term x_j^n would dominate if |x_j| > |x_i| for all other i. But since all the sums are zero, this would imply that x_j^n is canceled out by the other terms. However, as n grows, unless x_j = 0, this can't happen. Because if |x_j| > |x_i| for others, then |sum x_i^n| ≈ |x_j^n|, which would not be zero. Hence, all x_i must be zero. But this is more of an analytic approach, and since the problem allows complex numbers, maybe this works too. But maybe the algebraic approach using symmetric polynomials is more straightforward.\n\nAnother thought: the system of equations implies that the generating function for the power sums is identically zero. The generating function for power sums is sum_{n=1}^∞ p_n t^{n} = 0. But the generating function can also be written as sum_{i=1}^k x_i / (1 - x_i t). If this is identically zero, then each x_i must be zero. Wait, if sum_{i=1}^k x_i / (1 - x_i t) = 0 for all t in some neighborhood of 0, then each coefficient in the Laurent series must be zero. But each coefficient is sum x_i^{n+1} for the term t^n. Since all p_n = sum x_i^n = 0, then sum x_i^{n+1} = 0 as well. But that seems like the same condition. Maybe through complex analysis, if the generating function is identically zero, then all residues must be zero, implying each x_i = 0. Not sure if that's rigorous, but the generating function approach might also lead to the conclusion.\n\nAlternatively, using linear algebra. Suppose we have a non-trivial solution. Then, the vectors (x₁, x₂, ..., xₖ) must satisfy infinitely many equations. But since we are in finite dimensions, the system of equations would have a solution only if the variables are zero. But this is vague. The symmetric polynomial approach seems better.\n\nTherefore, the key idea is using Newton's identities to show that all elementary symmetric sums are zero, leading to the conclusion that all x_i are zero. Hence, the problem is solved.",
