I found the algebraic solutions here but I want to figure out how to calculate the above using geometrical arguments of complex numbers/ vectors. Some hints of geometry I figured out already: $\\frac{A+B}{2}$ is equidistant in angle mangitude from $A$ and $B$ , that is $|\\frac{A+B}{2} -A| = | \\frac{A+B}{2} - B|$ , similar results hold for the other angle averages. We may think of the above as summing the projections of three unit vectors onto the x-axis: $ \\left( \\tau(A) + \\tau(B) + \\tau(C) + \\tau( A+B+C)\\right) \\cdot \\hat{i}$ , where $\\tau(\\phi)$ is the unit vector making angle $\\phi$ with the x-axis Related , related",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about proving a trigonometric identity using geometric arguments, specifically involving complex numbers or vectors. The user wants a geometric proof rather than an algebraic one.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states the identity: cos A + cos B + cos C + cos(A+B+C) equals 4 cos[(A+B)/2] cos[(B+C)/2] cos[(A+C)/2]. The user mentions geometric arguments, complex numbers, vectors, and projections of unit vectors. \n\nAssumptions should list each condition applied to one object. Let's see. The main assumptions here are that A, B, C are angles, possibly in the context of vectors or complex numbers. The problem involves summing projections of unit vectors. The user also mentions that (A+B)/2 is equidistant from A and B in angle magnitude. However, that's more of an observation than an assumption. \n\nWait, the problem doesn't specify any restrictions on A, B, C other than being angles, right? So the key assumptions are that A, B, C are angles (real numbers), and that the proof should use geometric methods involving complex numbers or vectors. But how to phrase that as assumptions? The example given in the original query had assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So perhaps here, the assumptions would be:\n\n- A, B, C are real numbers (angles)\n- The proof uses geometric arguments involving complex numbers or vectors\n- The unit vectors τ(φ) make angle φ with the x-axis\n- Projections of unit vectors onto the x-axis are considered\n\nBut the user wants to structure the problem, not the solution. So the original problem's assumptions are just the given conditions. Wait, in the example, the original problem had the assumption that n is an integer, but the user added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe the example had a mistake? Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal problem example was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem listed assumptions as n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems contradictory. Because the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7. Hmm. Maybe the example was incorrect. But perhaps the user wanted to extract implicit assumptions. Wait, maybe the problem in the example actually had a typo, or perhaps the formatted problem added an extra assumption. Wait, the original example's formatted problem had:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91. But the original problem was for every integer n. So that might be an error. Maybe in that case, the user made a mistake in the example. But regardless, the task here is to structure the current problem.\n\nSo for the current problem, the user wants to structure the problem by listing assumptions and the problem statement. The problem as stated is to prove the trigonometric identity using geometric arguments, possibly involving complex numbers or vectors. The original problem's assumptions would be that A, B, C are angles (real numbers), and perhaps that the proof must use geometric methods (complex numbers/vectors), but the example's assumptions were about the variables, not the method. Wait, in the example, assumptions were about the variables (n is integer, etc.), not the method. So here, perhaps the assumptions are just the variables being angles (real numbers). The method (geometric proof) is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. So the problem is to prove the identity, with the added condition that it must be done geometrically. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- A, B, C are real numbers (angles)\n- The problem requires a geometric proof using complex numbers or vectors\n- Unit vectors are considered with angles A, B, C, and A+B+C\n- Projections of these vectors onto the x-axis are summed\n\nWait, but the example didn't include method-related assumptions. The example's assumptions were about the variables. So maybe here, the only assumptions are that A, B, C are angles (real numbers), and maybe that A+B+C is also an angle? Not sure. The original problem doesn't specify any restrictions on A, B, C, so the main assumption is that A, B, C are real numbers. The method is part of the problem instruction. So in the formatted problem, the problem statement should include the requirement to use geometric arguments.\n\nSo putting it together:\n\nAssumption:\nA, B, C are real numbers,\nτ(φ) is a unit vector making angle φ with the x-axis,\nThe problem involves the sum of projections of unit vectors onto the x-axis.\n\nProblem:\nProve geometrically (using complex numbers/vectors) that\n$$\\cos A + \\cos B + \\cos C + \\cos (A+B+C) = 4 \\cos \\frac{A+B}{2} \\cos \\frac{B+C}{2} \\cos \\frac{A+C}{2}$$\n\nBut wait, in the example, the assumptions were about the variables (n is integer, etc.), not the method. The method is part of the problem statement. So perhaps the assumptions here are just that A, B, C are real numbers (angles), and the problem is to prove the identity using geometric arguments. But the example didn't include method in assumptions. So maybe the assumptions are only about the variables, and the method is part of the problem statement. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nA, B, C are real numbers.\n\nProblem:\nProve geometrically (using complex numbers or vectors) that\n$$\\cos A + \\cos B + \\cos C + \\cos (A+B+C) = 4 \\cos \\frac{A+B}{2} \\cos \\frac{B+C}{2} \\cos \\frac{A+C}{2}$$\n\nBut the user's example included an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) not present in the original problem, which was for every integer n. So maybe the example was incorrect. But regardless, the current problem's assumptions are that A, B, C are real numbers. However, in the original problem, the user mentions \"geometrical arguments of complex numbers/vectors\" and some hints about angles. So maybe the assumptions should include that τ(φ) is a unit vector with angle φ. But that's part of the method, not the problem's inherent assumptions. The problem's inherent assumption is that A, B, C are angles. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nA, B, C are real numbers,\nA, B, C are angles measured in the same unit,\nThe sum involves projections of unit vectors onto the x-axis.\n\nBut I'm not sure. The original problem says \"geometric proof\" and mentions complex numbers/vectors, but those are part of the method, not assumptions. The example's assumptions were about the variables, not the method. So maybe just:\n\nAssumption:\nA, B, C are real numbers.\n\nProblem:\nProve geometrically (using complex numbers or vectors) that\n$$\\cos A + \\cos B + \\cos C + \\cos (A+B+C) = 4 \\cos \\frac{A+B}{2} \\cos \\frac{B+C}{2} \\cos \\frac{A+C}{2}$$\n\nYes, that seems right. The key is that the assumptions are the given conditions about the variables. The method (geometric proof) is part of the problem instruction, not an assumption. So the formatted problem would list A, B, C as real numbers (since they are angles), and the problem is to prove the identity using geometric methods.",
