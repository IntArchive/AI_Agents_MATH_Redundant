    "Content": "I am interested in a general closed-form formula for integrals of the following form:\n$$\\mathcal{J}_q=\\int_0^1x^{2\\,q-1}\\,K(x)^2dx,\\tag0$$\nwhere $K(x)$ is the complete elliptic integral of the 1ˢᵗ kind :\n$$K(x)={_2F_1}\\left(\\frac12,\\frac12;\\ 1;\\ x^2\\right)\\frac\\pi2\\\\=\\int_0^{\\pi/2}\\frac{d\\phi}{\\sqrt{1-x^2\\sin^2\\phi}}=\\int_0^1\\frac{dz}{\\sqrt{1-x^2z^2\\vphantom{|^2}}\\sqrt{1-z^2\\vphantom{|^2}}}.\\tag1$$\nI could not find a suitable integral in DLMF or Gradshteyn—Ryzhik or Prudnikov tables of integrals. Mathematica was not able to evaluate it either, even when the parameter $q$ was fixed to an integer ( Note : In Mathematica you would write EllipticK[x^2] for $K(x)$ because of a different convention for the modulus parameter). But , numerical integration and lookups in WolframAlpha and ISC+ suggest that there are closed forms for (at least some) postitive integer values of the parameter $q$. For example, $$\\mathcal{J}_1\\stackrel?=\\frac{7\\,\\zeta(3)}4,\\ \\mathcal{J}_2\\stackrel?=\\frac{7\\,\\zeta(3)}8+\\frac14,\\\\\\mathcal{J}_3\\stackrel?=\\frac{77\\,\\zeta(3)}{128}+\\frac{17}{64},\\ \\mathcal{J}_4\\stackrel?=\\frac{119\\,\\zeta(3)}{256}+\\frac{881}{3456},\\tag2$$\nwhere $\\zeta(3)$ is the Apéry constant .\nIt looks that the general formula for postitive integer values of $q$ is\n$$\\mathcal{J}_q\\stackrel?=a_q\\,\\zeta(3)+b_q,\\tag3$$\nwhere $a_q,\\,b_q$ are some rational coefficients. I tried to find general formulae for these coefficients, and actually discovered plausible candidates for both. Conjecturally, $a_q$ can be expressed in terms of a generalized hypergeometric function :\n$$a_q\\stackrel?=\\frac{7\\,\\pi}4\\cdot\\frac{{_4F_3}\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\\frac12,\\,\\frac12,\\,1-q,\\,1-q\\\\1,\\,\\frac32-q,\\,\\frac32-q\\end{array}\\middle|\\ 1\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac32-q\\right)^2\\ \\Gamma(q)^2}.\\tag4$$\nSomewhat suprisingly, this scarish expression seems to evaluate only to rationals for all $q\\in\\mathbb{Z}^+$. For $b_q$ I found only a conjectural recurrence relation:\n$$b_1\\stackrel?=0,\\ b_2\\stackrel?=\\frac14,\\ b_q\\stackrel?=\\frac{2 \\,(2\\,q-3)\\,\\left(2\\,q^2-6\\,q+5\\right)\\cdot b_{q-1}-4\\,(q-2)^3\\cdot b_{q-2}+1}{4\\,(q-1)^3},\\tag5$$\nbut I could not find a general term formula for it. Can we prove that the closed forms shown in $(2)$ are correct? Can we prove that the formula $(3)$ holds for all $q\\in\\mathbb{Z}^+$ with some rational coefficients $a_q,\\,b_q$? Are my conjectured formulae for these coefficients $(4),\\,(5)$ correct? Can the formula $(4)$ be expanded in terms of simpler functions? Is there a general term formula for $(5)$? Can we find (or at least conjecture) a general closed-form formula for $\\mathcal{J}_q$ where $q$ is not necessarily an integer?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to read through the original problem carefully and identify all the assumptions and the main problem.\n\nThe original question is about finding a closed-form formula for the integral \\(\\mathcal{J}_q = \\int_0^1 x^{2q-1} K(x)^2 dx\\), where \\(K(x)\\) is the complete elliptic integral of the 1st kind. The user mentions several things: they're interested in positive integer values of \\(q\\), have conjectured forms for \\(a_q\\) and \\(b_q\\) in terms of \\(\\zeta(3)\\) and rational coefficients, and have specific examples for \\(q=1,2,3,4\\). They also propose expressions (4) and (5) for \\(a_q\\) and a recurrence for \\(b_q\\), and ask several questions about proving these conjectures, generalizing to non-integer \\(q\\), etc.\n\nNow, the task is to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then, state the problem concisely.\n\nAssumptions would include:\n- \\(q\\) is a positive integer (since the conjectured forms are for integer \\(q\\), examples are for integers, and the problem asks about \\(q \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+\\))\n- \\(\\mathcal{J}_q = \\int_0^1 x^{2q-1} K(x)^2 dx\\) (definition of \\(\\mathcal{J}_q\\))\n- \\(K(x)\\) is the complete elliptic integral of the 1st kind (as defined in the problem)\n- The conjectured form \\(\\mathcal{J}_q = a_q \\zeta(3) + b_q\\) with rational \\(a_q, b_q\\) (since this is the conjecture they want verified)\n- The specific conjectured formulas for \\(a_q\\) and \\(b_q\\) (equations 4 and 5) might be separate assumptions, but since the problem is asking whether these are correct, maybe they are part of the problem rather than assumptions. Wait, the user is asking if their conjectures (4) and (5) are correct. So the conjectures themselves are part of the problem, not assumptions. The assumptions would be the conditions under which the problem is posed.\n\nWait, the original problem's assumptions are that \\(q\\) is a positive integer, that \\(K(x)\\) is defined as such, and the integral is as defined. The conjectures are what the user is proposing and wants to verify. So in the assumption section, we should list the given conditions and definitions, not the conjectures they made.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumptions:\n- \\(q\\) is a positive integer.\n- \\(K(x)\\) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind, defined as \\(K(x) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} {_2F_1}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}; 1; x^2\\right)\\).\n- \\(\\mathcal{J}_q = \\int_0^1 x^{2q-1} K(x)^2 dx\\).\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove the conjectured closed form \\(\\mathcal{J}_q = a_q \\zeta(3) + b_q\\) with rational coefficients \\(a_q, b_q\\) for all positive integers \\(q\\). Determine if the proposed formulas for \\(a_q\\) (equation 4) and the recurrence for \\(b_q\\) (equation 5) are correct. Investigate whether \\(a_q\\) can be expressed in simpler terms, find a general term for \\(b_q\\), and extend the formula to non-integer \\(q\\).\n\nBut the problem part should be concise. The original problem asks several questions:\n\n1. Can we prove the closed forms in (2) are correct?\n2. Can we prove that (3) holds for all \\(q \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+\\) with rational coefficients?\n3. Are conjectures (4) and (5) correct?\n4. Can (4) be expanded in simpler functions?\n5. Is there a general term formula for (5)?\n6. Can we find a closed-form for non-integer \\(q\\)?\n\nSo the problem part should encapsulate these questions. However, the user provided an example where the problem is a single statement. The example's problem was: \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91.\"\n\nIn this case, the problem is more complex with multiple parts. However, the user wants the problem structured into a single \"Problem:\" line. So perhaps we need to condense the questions into one problem statement that includes all the aspects.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is as written, and the user wants to have the problem as the main question, with the assumptions as the given conditions.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- \\(q\\) is a positive integer.\n- \\(K(x)\\) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind.\n- \\(\\mathcal{J}_q = \\int_0^1 x^{2q-1} K(x)^2 dx\\).\n- For some positive integers \\(q\\), \\(\\mathcal{J}_q\\) conjecturally equals \\(a_q \\zeta(3) + b_q\\) with rational \\(a_q, b_q\\).\n- Specific conjectures for \\(a_q\\) and \\(b_q\\) are given by equations (4) and (5).\n\nBut wait, the original problem's assumptions are that they have these conjectures based on numerical integration and lookups, but the actual assumptions are the definitions and conditions. The conjectures are part of the problem to be proven.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should only be the given conditions and definitions, not the conjectures. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n- \\(q\\) is a positive integer.\n- \\(K(x)\\) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind, defined as \\(K(x) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} {_2F_1}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}; 1; x^2\\right)\\).\n- \\(\\mathcal{J}_q = \\int_0^1 x^{2q-1} K(x)^2 dx\\).\n- Numerical integration and lookups suggest closed forms for \\(\\mathcal{J}_q\\) when \\(q\\) is a positive integer, expressed as \\(a_q \\zeta(3) + b_q\\) with rational coefficients \\(a_q, b_q\\).\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove the conjectured closed forms for \\(\\mathcal{J}_q\\) as \\(a_q \\zeta(3) + b_q\\) for all positive integers \\(q\\). Verify the correctness of the proposed formulas for \\(a_q\\) (equation 4) and the recurrence relation for \\(b_q\\) (equation 5). Determine if \\(a_q\\) can be simplified, find a general term for \\(b_q\\), and conjecture a closed-form for non-integer \\(q\\).\n\nBut maybe the problem needs to be even more concise. The original example had the problem as a single statement. Given that, perhaps the problem here is a series of questions, but the format example shows the problem as a single sentence. Maybe we can phrase the problem as the main question, and the sub-questions are part of the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, the user's example had:\n\nOriginal problem mentions proving divisibility by 91, and in the formatted version, the assumption includes that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Then the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nSo in that example, the problem is to prove the divisibility, and the assumptions are the conditions on n.\n\nSimilarly here, the problem is to prove the conjectured closed forms, verify the conjectures for a_q and b_q, etc. So perhaps the problem line is a list of the questions posed.\n\nBut the user's example shows that the problem is one sentence. So perhaps in this case, the problem is the main overarching question, and the sub-questions are part of it.\n\nBut the user's example shows that even if the original problem is a proof, the formatted version just states \"Prove that...\".\n\nIn this case, the original problem is multiple questions: prove closed forms in (2), prove (3) holds, are (4) and (5) correct, can (4) be simplified, find general term for (5), conjecture for non-integer q.\n\nBut the user's instruction says: \"structure that problem as the following format\". The example included the assumptions and the problem. So perhaps we need to capture all the questions in the problem line.\n\nBut given the example, perhaps the problem is a single statement. Maybe the main problem is to prove the conjectured closed form, and the rest are sub-questions. But the user's instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\", so the user's own example includes a problem line that is the main task, with assumptions.\n\nTherefore, for this problem:\n\nAssumption:\n- \\(q\\) is a positive integer.\n- \\(K(x)\\) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind.\n- \\(\\mathcal{J}_q = \\int_0^1 x^{2q-1} K(x)^2 dx\\).\n- Numerical evidence suggests \\(\\mathcal{J}_q = a_q \\zeta(3) + b_q\\) for rational coefficients \\(a_q, b_q\\).\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove the conjectured closed form \\(\\mathcal{J}_q = a_q \\zeta(3) + b_q\\) for all positive integers \\(q\\), verify the proposed formulas for \\(a_q\\) and \\(b_q\\), simplify \\(a_q\\)'s expression, find a general term for \\(b_q\\), and extend the formula to non-integer \\(q\\).\n\nBut maybe even more concise. Let's check the original problem's title: \"Conjectured closed form for [integral]\" and the questions in the body. The main problem is to prove the conjectured closed form. The other questions are subsidiary.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nProblem:\nProve that the integral \\(\\mathcal{J}_q = \\int_0^1 x^{2q-1} K(x)^2 dx\\) has the closed form \\(a_q \\zeta(3) + b_q\\) for positive integers \\(q\\), validate the conjectured expressions for \\(a_q\\) and \\(b_q\\), simplify these expressions, and extend the result to non-integer \\(q\\).\n\nBut need to ensure all parts are included. The original problem has several specific questions: correctness of (2), correctness of (3) for all q, correctness of (4) and (5), expanding (4), general term for (5), non-integer q.\n\nSo perhaps the problem statement should encapsulate all these questions. However, the user's example problem was a single sentence. The challenge is to balance conciseness with completeness.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is as written in the original title and the body. The title is \"Conjectured closed form for [integral]\", so the main problem is to prove this conjecture, and the rest are sub-questions.\n\nThus, in the formatted version, the problem line would be: \"Prove the conjectured closed form for \\(\\mathcal{J}_q = \\int_0^1 x^{2q-1} K(x)^2 dx\\) where \\(K(x)\\) is the complete elliptic integral of the 1st kind, and address the related conjectures for coefficients \\(a_q\\), \\(b_q\\), their formulas, and extension to non-integer \\(q\\).\"\n\nBut that's still lengthy.\n\nAlternatively, follow the example's approach: the problem is the main task, and the assumptions are the conditions. So here, the assumptions are that q is a positive integer, K(x) is defined as such, and J_q is the integral. The problem is to prove the conjectured closed form and related conjectures.\n\nBut how to phrase that concisely?\n\nPerhaps:\n\nProblem:\nProve that for each positive integer \\(q\\), the integral \\(\\mathcal{J}_q = \\int_0^1 x^{2q-1} K(x)^2 dx\\) can be expressed as \\(a_q \\zeta(3) + b_q\\) with rational coefficients \\(a_q, b_q\\), verify the conjectured formulas for \\(a_q\\) and \\(b_q\\), simplify these formulas, and generalize to non-integer \\(q\\).\n\nThis includes the main problem and the subsidiary questions.\n\nNow, checking the example again: in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, but the formatted problem lists both as assumptions and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. The user in the example had to extract the assumptions (n integer, n divisible by 7) and the problem (prove A(n) divisible by 91).\n\nIn the current problem, the original post's assumptions are:\n\n- q is a positive integer (since they're looking at integer q)\n- K(x) is the complete elliptic integral as defined\n- J_q is the integral as defined\n- Conjectured form J_q = a_q ζ(3) + b_q\n- Specific conjectures for a_q and b_q\n\nBut the conjectures are part of what needs to be proven, so they are not assumptions. So the assumptions should be:\n\n- q is a positive integer\n- K(x) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind (with given definitions)\n- J_q is defined as the integral from 0 to 1 of x^{2q-1} K(x)^2 dx\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that J_q can be expressed as a_q ζ(3) + b_q with rational coefficients a_q, b_q for all positive integers q, verify the conjectured formulas (4) and (5) for these coefficients, simplify the expression for a_q, determine a general term for b_q, and extend the result to non-integer q.\n\nBut again, need to make it concise.\n\nAlternatively, following the example's structure, where assumptions are the given conditions, and the problem is the main task. In the example, the original problem had to prove divisibility by 91, with the assumption that n is an integer divisible by 7. So perhaps here, the problem is to prove the conjectured closed form (including the expressions for a_q and b_q) and address the related questions.\n\nBut given the complexity, maybe the best approach is:\n\nAssumption:\n- \\(q\\) is a positive integer.\n- \\(K(x)\\) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind, defined as \\(K(x) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} {_2F_1}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}; 1; x^2\\right)\\).\n- \\(\\mathcal{J}_q = \\int_0^1 x^{2q-1} K(x)^2 dx\\).\n- Numerical evidence suggests \\(\\mathcal{J}_q = a_q \\zeta(3) + b_q\\) with rational coefficients \\(a_q, b_q\\) for specific positive integers \\(q\\).\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove the conjectured closed form \\(\\mathcal{J}_q = a_q \\zeta(3) + b_q\\) for all positive integers \\(q\\), verify the proposed expressions for \\(a_q\\) (equation 4) and \\(b_q\\) (equation 5), simplify \\(a_q\\)'s hypergeometric expression, find a general term for \\(b_q\\), and conjecture a closed-form for non-integer \\(q\\).\n\nThis captures all the questions in the original problem.",
