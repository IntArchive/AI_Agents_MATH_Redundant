    "Content": "\"Japanese theorem\" is the name given to the following result (see Fig. 1 below) :  if $A_1A_2A_3A_4$ is a cyclic quadrilateral, the incenters of the $4$ triangles $A_pA_qA_r$ with all triples $\\{p,q,r\\}$ are the vertices of a rectangle $R$ . Moreover, the medians of rectangle $R$ intersect circular arcs $A_{k}A_{k+1}$ (with $A_5:=A_1$ ) in their midpoints. In fact, there is a second level of properties that is seldom given ( see references and comments at the end of the text ): Let $\\frak{E}$ denote the set of the $4 \\times 3 = 12$ excenters of all triangles $A_pA_qA_r$ : The convex hull of $\\frak{E}$ is a rectangle $R'$ with sides parallel to sides of rectangle $R$ . The 8 other points of $\\frak{E}$ are situated on the sides of rectangle $R'$ at the intersection of the extended sides of rectangle $R$ . Fig. 1 : Rectangles R (blue vertices) and R' (red vertices). Midpoints of arcs $A_kA_{k+1}$ in black. Fig. 2 enriches Fig. 1 with the four circles associated with triangle $A_1A_2A_3$ (its incircle and its three excircles) [Drawing all the incircles and excircles would give a too messy picture]. Fig. 2 : Incircle and the three excircles of triangle $A_1A_2A_3$ . Some supplementary properties exist. I will not give them here. My questions dealing with this second part of the japanese theorem : is there is a simple proof of it ? The proof I have done is rather complicated. I have the feeling that there must be more direct proofs. are there known consequences of this rather surprizing result ?

    "AcceptedAnswer": "Not an answer, but an additional figure, showing cyclic quadrilateral $\\square ABCD$ and the various angle bisectors (and perpendiculars thereto) that define the incenters and excenters. The incenter of $\\triangle BCD$ is labeled \"$A^\\prime$\", because $A$ is the excluded vertex of the quadrilateral. Likewise, the excenters of $\\triangle BCD$ feature \"$A$\", with subscripts indicating the vertex opposite the excenter in that triangle. There are a few hard-to-see concurrences along the circle. For instance, $\\overline{AD_A} \\cap \\overline{DA_D}$ is the midpoint of $\\stackrel{\\frown}{BC}$. This is because each segment bisects an inscribed angle subtending that arc. $\\overline{A_BA_C}\\cap\\overline{D_BD_C}$ is the point diametrically opposite $\\overline{AD_A}\\cap\\overline{DA_D}$. Here's another diagram, that arose from investigating an inverse: Starting with rectangle $\\square WXYZ$, we choose points $P$, $Q$, $R$, $S$ and $P^\\prime$, $Q^\\prime$, $R^\\prime$, $S^\\prime$ (with primed and un-primed pairs being images under a symmetric reflection). The condition under which $\\overline{PQ^\\prime}$, $\\overline{R^\\prime Z}$, $\\overline{SX}$\nto concur (at $A$) forces the corresponding concurrences at $B$, $C$, $D$; moreover, it forces $\\square ABCD$ to be cyclic. Interestingly, there's no requirement that the \"inner\" rectangle lie inside the \"outer\" rectangle. A cyclic $\\square ABCD$ occurs no matter where $P$, $Q$, $R$, $S$ lie on the outer rectangle's edge-lines. However, $\\square WXYZ$ is not the rectangle associated with $\\square ABCD$ by the second part of the Japanese Theorem; also, the \"inner\" rectangle isn't the rectangle of incenters from the first part. Those rectangles are quite distinct (the outer one is labeled $\\square W^\\prime X^\\prime Y^\\prime Z^\\prime$), although their edges are parallel to those of $\\square WXYZ$. (The \"inner\" rectangles do not necessarily share a center.) Investigation continues ... Here's a bit of a rebooted discussion of the \"inverse\" situation. (Throughout, I'll conveniently ignore various degeneracies, especially those that cause denominators to vanish.) Let $\\square PQRS$ and $\\square P^\\prime Q^\\prime R^\\prime S^\\prime$ be \"parallel\" rectangles, with $P$ and $P^\\prime$ being \"opposite\" vertices as indicated in the figure. Also, let $P^\\prime$ project to points $P^{\\prime\\prime}$ and $P^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}$ on the sides of $\\square PQRS$ as shown. It's not hard to prove with coordinates that lines $\\overleftrightarrow{PP^\\prime}$, $\\overleftrightarrow{S^{\\prime\\prime}Q^\\prime}$, $\\overleftrightarrow{R^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}S^\\prime}$ concur at a point, $P_\\circ$. (One can prove the concurrence using the trigonometric form of Ceva's Theorem in $\\triangle P^\\prime S^{\\prime\\prime} R^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}$, but the details are a little messy.) Treating points as position vectors, one can write specifically that $$P_\\circ = \\frac{P^\\prime\\;|\\square PR^\\prime| - P\\;|\\square P^\\prime R^\\prime|}{|\\square PR^\\prime| - |\\square P^\\prime R^\\prime| }$$\nwhere $|\\square XY|$ denotes the area of the rectangle with diagonal $\\overline{XY}$. From this form, we deduce\n$$\\frac{|\\overline{PP_\\circ}|}{|\\overline{PP^\\prime}|} = \\frac{|\\square PR^\\prime|}{|\\square PR^\\prime|-|\\square P^\\prime R^\\prime|} \\qquad\n\\frac{|\\overline{P^\\prime P_\\circ}|}{|\\overline{PP^\\prime}|} = \\frac{|\\square P^\\prime R^\\prime|}{|\\square PR^\\prime|-|\\square P^\\prime R^\\prime|} \\qquad \\frac{|\\overline{P^\\prime P_\\circ}|}{|\\overline{PP_\\circ}|} = \\frac{|\\square P^\\prime R^\\prime|}{|\\square PR^\\prime|}$$ Likewise, we can get points-of-concurrency $Q_\\circ$, $R_\\circ$, $S_\\circ$. In general, these points are not concyclic. They are concyclic if $\\square P^\\prime Q^\\prime R^\\prime S^\\prime$ is centered horizontally, and/or vertically, with respect to $\\square PQRS$, or, more interestingly, if $$|\\square PR^\\prime|\\,|\\square P^\\prime R| = |\\square PQRS|\\,|\\square P^\\prime Q^\\prime R^\\prime S^\\prime| = |\\square QS^\\prime|\\,|\\square Q^\\prime S| \\tag{$\\star$}$$\n  That is, the product of the areas of the inner and outer rectangles is equal to the product of the areas of either pair of \"diagonal\" rectangles . (I don't have a clear geometric proof of this fact; I let Mathematica crunch through a coordinate argument.) Intriguingly, condition $(\\star)$ has a very simple Ceva-like representation. If we define $p$, $q$, $r$, $s$ such that \n$$\\overrightarrow{PP^{\\prime\\prime}} = p\\;\\overrightarrow{P^{\\prime\\prime}Q} \\qquad\n\\overrightarrow{QQ^{\\prime\\prime}} = q\\;\\overrightarrow{Q^{\\prime\\prime}R}  \\qquad \\overrightarrow{RR^{\\prime\\prime}} = r\\;\\overrightarrow{R^{\\prime\\prime}S} \\qquad \\overrightarrow{SS^{\\prime\\prime}} = s\\;\\overrightarrow{S^{\\prime\\prime}P}$$\nthen $(\\star)$ is equivalent to $$p r + q s = pqrs \\tag{$\\star\\star$}$$ (Typically, the Ceva ratio would be the reciprocal of the one I've written. Writing $\\overline{p}$ (etc) for that reciprocal, relation $(\\star)$ would be even simpler: $\\overline{p}\\overline{q}+\\overline{r}\\overline{s} = 1$. The relations below would be a little messier, however.) Condition $(\\star)$ also implies the concurrence of $\\overleftrightarrow{QP^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}}$, $\\overleftrightarrow{S^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}R^{\\prime\\prime}}$, $\\overleftrightarrow{Q^{\\prime\\prime}S}$, with the common point being $P_\\circ$. (Importantly, mere horizontal/vertical centering of the rectangles does not guarantee this concurrence, so this property is not equivalent to $\\square P_\\circ Q_\\circ R_\\circ S_\\circ$ being cyclic.) This is how we get the configurations shown in the earlier part of this answer. It's worth noting a few other relations involving the Ceva-like ratios. For instance, \n$$\\frac{|\\square PQRS|}{|\\square PR^\\prime|} = (1+r)(1+s) \\qquad\n\\frac{|\\square PQRS|}{|\\square P^\\prime R|} = (1+p)(1+q) \\qquad \\cdots$$\n$$\\frac{|\\square PQRS|}{|\\square P^\\prime Q^\\prime R^\\prime S^\\prime|} = \\frac{(1+p)(1+q)(1+r)(1+s)}{(1-pr)(1-qs)} \\;\\stackrel{(\\star\\star)}{=}\\; (1+p)(1+q)(1+r)(1+s)$$\n$$\\frac{|\\overline{P^\\prime P_\\circ}|}{|\\overline{PP_\\circ}|}  = \\frac{(1-pr)(1-qs)}{(1+p)(1+q)}\\;\\stackrel{(\\star\\star)}{=}\\; \\frac{1}{(1+p)(1+q)}$$ Of course, no nowhere in here have we said anything about incenters or excenters or angle bisectors. We can see that the (extended) Japanese Theorem configuration is a special case of a $(\\star\\star)$ configuration as follows: Given cyclic $\\square P_\\circ Q_\\circ R_\\circ S_\\circ$, define \n$$\\alpha := \\frac{1}{2}\\angle Q_\\circ P_\\circ R_\\circ \\quad\n\\beta  := \\frac{1}{2}\\angle R_\\circ Q_\\circ S_\\circ \\quad\n\\gamma := \\frac{1}{2}\\angle S_\\circ R_\\circ P_\\circ \\quad\n\\delta := \\frac{1}{2}\\angle P_\\circ S_\\circ Q_\\circ$$ (Note: $\\alpha+\\beta+\\gamma+\\delta = 90^\\circ$.) Let $P$, $Q$, $P^\\prime$ be excenters, opposite $P_\\circ$, $Q_\\circ$, $Q_\\circ$, for respective triangles $\\triangle P_\\circ Q_\\circ S_\\circ$, $\\triangle Q_\\circ P_\\circ R_\\circ$, $\\triangle Q_\\circ R_\\circ S_\\circ$. With $k$ the radius of the circle, one can calculate $$|\\overline{PP^\\prime}| = 4 k \\sin(\\alpha+\\beta) \\sin(\\alpha+\\delta) \\qquad |\\overline{P^\\prime Q}| = 4 k \\cos\\alpha \\sin\\gamma$$\nand likewise for various other excenters, so that\n$$\\begin{align}\n\\frac{1}{p}\\frac{1}{r}+\\frac{1}{q}\\frac{1}{s} &= \\frac{\\cos\\alpha\\sin\\gamma \\cdot \\cos\\gamma \\sin\\alpha + \\cos\\beta\\sin\\delta\\cdot \\cos\\delta \\sin\\beta}{\\sin(\\alpha+\\beta)\\sin(\\beta+\\gamma)\\sin(\\gamma+\\delta)\\sin(\\delta+\\alpha)} \\\\[4pt]\n&=\\frac{\\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\sin 2\\alpha \\sin 2\\gamma + \\sin 2\\beta \\sin 2\\delta\\right)}{\\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\sin 2\\alpha \\sin 2\\gamma + \\sin 2\\beta \\sin 2\\delta\\right)} \\\\[4pt] \n&=1\n\\end{align}$$\nsatisfying $(\\star\\star)$. (How $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $\\gamma$, $\\delta$ relate to $p$, $q$, $r$, $s$ when $P$, $Q$, $R$, $S$, etc, are not excenters is not (yet) known.)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is talking about the extended form of the Japanese theorem. The original theorem states that for a cyclic quadrilateral, the incenters of the four triangles formed by triples of vertices form a rectangle. The extended part here mentions that the set of 12 excenters (each triangle has three excenters, so 4 triangles × 3 excenters = 12) forms another rectangle R', with specific properties: the convex hull of these excenters is R', which has sides parallel to R, and the other eight excenters lie on the sides of R' where the extended sides of R meet them.\n\nThe user is asking two questions: first, if there's a simple proof of this extended result, and second, about any known consequences. They mention they have a complicated proof and suspect a simpler one exists. They also want to know about consequences.\n\nBut according to the format provided, I need to structure the problem by listing assumptions and then the problem statement. The example given shows that assumptions are specific conditions applied to one object each. The original problem mentions a cyclic quadrilateral, so that's an assumption. The problem is to prove the properties of the excenters forming rectangle R' with the mentioned properties.\n\nWait, the problem as stated in the user's question includes the extended form's properties. So, the assumptions should include that the quadrilateral is cyclic. Then the problem is about proving that the convex hull of the 12 excenters is a rectangle R' with sides parallel to R, and the other excenters lie on the sides of R' at intersections of extended sides of R.\n\nBut the user's own example included an assumption about divisibility by 7. Here, the key assumptions would be that A1A2A3A4 is a cyclic quadrilateral, and maybe that all excenters of the four triangles are considered. But the problem statement is to prove the properties about R' and the excenters' positions.\n\nSo structuring this:\n\nAssumptions:\n- A1A2A3A4 is a cyclic quadrilateral.\n- For each triangle A_pA_qA_r (where {p,q,r} are triples from {1,2,3,4}), consider the three excenters.\n- The set 𝔈 consists of all 12 excenters of these four triangles.\n\nProblem:\nProve that:\n1. The convex hull of 𝔈 is a rectangle R' with sides parallel to the sides of rectangle R (formed by the incenters).\n2. The remaining 8 excenters (not vertices of R') lie on the sides of R' at the intersections of the extended sides of R.\n\nAdditionally, the user is asking if there's a simple proof and about known consequences, but according to the format, maybe the problem part should just be the proof part. The example only included the problem statement, not the meta-questions. However, the user's original problem included two questions: one about a simple proof and another about consequences. But the example given by the user in the prompt shows that the problem is restructured into Assumption and Problem parts, even though the original problem might have multiple questions. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem lists the assumptions (n is integer, n is divisible by 7) and the problem. So here, perhaps the user's actual questions (about the existence of a simple proof and consequences) are part of the problem statement.\n\nBut wait, the user is asking for the problem to be structured into assumptions and problem. The original question on Math SE is the user's own question, which is about the extended Japanese theorem. So the problem here is the user's own questions: 1. Is there a simple proof of the extended form? 2. Are there known consequences?\n\nBut maybe the problem needs to be structured as per the content of the theorem they are referring to. Wait, the user is asking to structure the problem as per the example. The example took the problem statement, filtered unrelated info, and structured into assumptions and problem. The original problem in the example was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n)... is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem listed assumptions (n is integer, n divisible by 7) and problem to prove divisibility by 91. Wait, but in that example, the assumption that n is divisible by 7 might not have been in the original problem. Wait, looking at the example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumption includes n is integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that's conflicting because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example is wrong? Because if the original problem states \"for every integer n\", then the assumption should just be n is an integer, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. But the formatted problem in the example adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems like a mistake. Unless maybe the original problem had some condition on n divisible by 7 but was presented differently. Hmm, perhaps there was a miscommunication in the example. But the user provided that example as their own, so we need to follow that structure regardless.\n\nIn this current problem, the original question is about the extended Japanese theorem. The user is asking two questions: 1. Is there a simple proof of the extended form? 2. Are there known consequences? But according to the example, the formatted problem should list assumptions and then the problem. However, in the example, the problem was a theorem to prove, not a question about whether a proof exists. So perhaps the user wants to structure the theorem's conditions as assumptions and the conclusion as the problem. The user's own question (the Math SE question) is asking about the existence of a simple proof and consequences, but maybe the formatted problem is about the theorem itself.\n\nSo, the theorem's extended form has certain conditions (the quadrilateral is cyclic) and conclusions (the excenters form a rectangle R' with certain properties). Therefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption: A1A2A3A4 is a cyclic quadrilateral.\n\nProblem: Prove that the convex hull of the 12 excenters of the four triangles A_pA_qA_r is a rectangle R' with sides parallel to the rectangle R formed by the incenters, and the remaining eight excenters lie on the sides of R' at the intersections of the extended sides of R.\n\nBut the original problem mentions more details: the convex hull of 𝔈 is R', the sides are parallel, and the other 8 excenters are on the sides of R' where the extended sides of R meet them. So those are the two parts to prove.\n\nBut the user's actual question is whether there is a simple proof and about consequences, but according to the example, the formatted problem is about the theorem statement, not the meta-questions. Wait, the example's original problem was a theorem to prove, and the formatted version extracted assumptions and problem. The current user's question on Math SE is asking about the existence of a proof and consequences, but maybe the formatted problem should present the theorem that needs proof as the problem, with assumptions being the cyclic quadrilateral, etc.\n\nSo the user's actual problem is the extended Japanese theorem, and their questions are about its proof and consequences. Therefore, structuring the problem as per the theorem's statement:\n\nAssumption: A1A2A3A4 is a cyclic quadrilateral.\n\nProblem: Prove that the convex hull of the 12 excenters of the four triangles formed by triples of its vertices is a rectangle R' with sides parallel to the rectangle R formed by the incenters, and the remaining eight excenters lie on the sides of R' at the intersections of the extended sides of R.\n\nThen, the user's actual questions (about simple proof and consequences) would be part of the problem statement, but according to the example, the formatted problem only includes the problem to solve, not the meta-questions. Therefore, perhaps the formatted problem should be as above, and the user's own questions (seeking a simple proof and consequences) are the actual questions they are asking, but in the formatted problem, it's structured as a theorem to prove.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's problem is asking for the proof and consequences, so the assumptions are the cyclic quadrilateral and the properties of the original Japanese theorem, and the problem is to provide a simple proof and identify consequences. But that might not fit the example's structure.\n\nGiven the example, the problem part is the mathematical statement to prove. Hence, the correct approach is to extract the theorem's conditions as assumptions and the conclusion as the problem. The user's questions about the proof and consequences are their own, but the formatted problem is about the theorem itself.\n\nSo final answer:\n\nAssumption:\n- A1A2A3A4 is a cyclic quadrilateral.\n- For each triangle formed by three vertices of A1A2A3A4, consider its three excenters.\n- The set 𝔈 consists of all 12 excenters of the four triangles.\n\nProblem:\nProve that:\n1. The convex hull of 𝔈 is a rectangle R' with sides parallel to the rectangle R formed by the incenters.\n2. The remaining eight excenters lie on the sides of R' at the intersections of the extended sides of R.\n\nBut the example had each assumption as a separate line, each addressing one property applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- A1A2A3A4 is a cyclic quadrilateral.\n- Each triangle A_pA_qA_r (where {p,q,r} is a triple from {1,2,3,4}) has three excenters.\n- The set 𝔈 contains all 12 excenters of the four triangles A_pA_qA_r.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the convex hull of 𝔈 is a rectangle R' with sides parallel to rectangle R (formed by the incenters of the four triangles), and the eight remaining excenters lie on the sides of R' at the intersections of the extended sides of R.",
