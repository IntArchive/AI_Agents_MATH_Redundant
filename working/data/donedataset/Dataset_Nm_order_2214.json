Perhaps the simplest example is the parametrization of primitive Pythagorean triples $\\ x^2 + y^2 = z^2.\\,$ The essence of the proof is: $\\ x+y\\ i,\\ x-y\\ i\\ $ are coprime factors of a square in the UFD $\\,\\Bbb Z[i]\\,$ so they must themselves be squares (up to unit factors $\\,i^n).\\,$ Hence $\\ x + y\\ i\\ =\\ (m + n\\ i)^2 =\\ m^2 - n^2 + 2mn\\,i.\\,$ Similarly we can solve low degree cases of Fermat's Last Theorem by employing analogous factorizations over certain rings of algebraic integers. For example, Gauss showed there are no solutions for exponent $3$ by working in the ring of integers of $\\ \\mathbb Q(\\sqrt{-3}),\\,$ and Dirichlet did similarly for exponent $5$ using $\\ \\mathbb Q(\\sqrt{5}).\\,$ Later Kummer generalized these techniques to handle all regular prime exponents by working over rings of cyclotomic integers. For a nice exposition see Ribenboim: 13 lectures on Fermat's last theorem . Weil nicely summarizes the essence of these techniques (which generalizes Fermat's method of infinite descent ) in his Number Theory , Ch.IV,S.VI,p.335, (",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem properly. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified assumption-problem format. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original problem carefully. The problem states: If \\( m^2 = (a+1)^3 - a^3 \\) where \\( m, a \\in \\mathbb{N} \\), then prove that there exist \\( c, d \\in \\mathbb{N} \\) such that \\( m = c^2 + d^2 \\). The user also mentions an edit with a hint that \\( m = n^2 + (n+1)^2 \\) but they don't know how to find \\( n \\) for a given \\( m \\).\n\nNow, according to the example provided, the Assumptions section should list each condition applied to one object. The original problem mentions \\( m, a \\) are natural numbers, and the equation \\( m^2 = (a+1)^3 - a^3 \\). The conclusion is that \\( m \\) can be expressed as the sum of two squares. \n\nSo, breaking down the assumptions:\n\n1. \\( m \\) is a natural number.\n2. \\( a \\) is a natural number.\n3. The equation \\( m^2 = (a+1)^3 - a^3 \\) holds.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The problem is to prove the existence of \\( c, d \\) in natural numbers such that \\( m = c^2 + d^2 \\).\n\nWait, the original problem says \\( m, a \\in \\mathbb{N} \\), so both are natural numbers. The equation is given as \\( m^2 = (a+1)^3 - a^3 \\). The conclusion is that \\( m \\) is a sum of two squares. The user's edit mentions a possible form \\( m = n^2 + (n+1)^2 \\), which is a specific case of the sum of two squares. But the problem statement in the title says \"m is the sum of two squares,\" so the conclusion should be general, not necessarily that specific form. However, the user's hint suggests that they might have a specific form in mind, but the problem as stated is more general.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are straightforward: natural numbers \\( m \\) and \\( a \\), and the equation. The problem is to show \\( m \\) can be written as the sum of two natural number squares.\n\nI need to make sure the problem part is correctly phrased. The original problem says \"Prove that: If \\( m^2 = (a+1)^3 - a^3 \\) where \\( m,a \\in \\mathbb{N} \\implies \\exists c,d \\in \\mathbb{N} \\) such that \\( m=c^2+d^2 \\).\" But in the structured format, the problem is just the statement to prove. So, perhaps rephrase it as \"Prove that there exist natural numbers \\( c \\) and \\( d \\) such that \\( m = c^2 + d^2 \\).\"\n\nChecking the example given in the user's instruction: The example had assumptions about \\( n \\) being an integer and divisible by 7, but in the original problem, the divisibility by 7 wasn't mentioned. Wait, that might be a mistake. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was to prove that \\( A(n) \\) is divisible by 91 for every integer \\( n \\), but the formatted problem included an assumption that \\( n \\) is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the user's example was wrong? Because the original problem didn't state that \\( n \\) is divisible by 7. Wait, the original problem in the example was to prove for every integer \\( n \\), the expression is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem added an assumption that \\( n \\) is divisible by 7. That seems like an error. But perhaps the user intended to modify the problem? Maybe the example is incorrect, but I need to follow the user's instruction regardless.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user hasn't added any extra assumptions. The original problem's assumptions are \\( m, a \\in \\mathbb{N} \\) and \\( m^2 = (a+1)^3 - a^3 \\). So the assumptions should be listed as three separate points: m is a natural number, a is a natural number, and the equation holds. Then the problem is to prove that m can be expressed as the sum of two squares.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n- \\( m \\) is a natural number,\n- \\( a \\) is a natural number,\n- \\( m^2 = (a + 1)^3 - a^3 \\).\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exist natural numbers \\( c \\) and \\( d \\) such that \\( m = c^2 + d^2 \\).\n\nWait, the original problem uses \"∃c,d ∈ N\" so in the problem statement, it's to show existence. The title says \"m is the sum of two squares,\" which is equivalent. So this should be correct.\n\nI think that's it. Let me verify again. Each assumption is a single condition on one object. The three assumptions are m∈N, a∈N, and the equation. The problem is to show m is sum of two squares. The user's example had an incorrect extra assumption (divisible by 7), but perhaps the user made a mistake there. But in the current problem, we stick to the original problem's assumptions.",
