    "Content": "I've found at least 3 other posts$^*$ regarding this theorem, but the posts don't address the issues that I have. Below is a proof that for infinitely many primes of the form $4n+3$, there's a few questions I have in the proof which I'll mark accordingly. Proof : Suppose there were only finitely many primes $p_1,\\dots, p_k$, which are of the form $4n+3$. Let $N = 4p_1\\cdots p_k - 1$. This number is of the form $4n+3$ and is also not prime as it is larger than all the possible primes of the same form. Therefore, it is divisible by a prime $ \\color{green}{ \\text{(How did they get to this conclusion?)}}$. However, none of the $p_1,\\dots, p_k$ divide $N$. So every prime which divides $N$ must be of the form $4n+1$ $ \\color{green}{ \\text{(Why must it be of this form?)}}$. But notice any two numbers of the form $4n+1$ form a product of the same form, which contradicts the definition of $N$. Contradiction. $\\square$ Then as a follow-up question, the text asks \"Why does a proof of this flavor fail for primes of the form $4n+1$? $ \\color{green}{ \\text{(This is my last question.)}}$ $^*$One involves congruences, which I haven't learned yet. The other is a solution-verification type question. The last one makes use of a lemma that is actually one of my questions, but wasn't a question in that post.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Every number $n>1$ is divisible by some prime $p$ (which includes the case $n=p$). Assume otherwise and let $n$ be the smallest such number. As this $n$ is not prime, it has a nontrivivial divisor $d$ with $1<d<n$. By minimality of $n$, $d$ is divisible by some prime $p$. But then $p$ also divides $n$. All numbers are of the form $4n$, $4n+1$, $4n+2$, or $4n+3$.\nThis is also true for primes $p$, but $p=4n$ is not possible and $p=2n$ only for $p=2$. Here, we have excluded $p=2$ as well as $p=4n+3$ by construction, which leaves only primes $p=4n+1$. This proof fails for $p=4n+1$ because a number of the form $4n+1$ may well be the product of two numbers of the form $4n-1$. For example $3\\cdot 7=21$. Therefore the step that at least one divisor must be of form $4n+1$ fails.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants me to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question provided. The original question is about proving there are infinitely many primes of the form 4n+3, and the user has some specific questions embedded in their proof explanation.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. The example given shows that assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. The problem is then stated clearly.\n\nLooking at the original problem here: The user is presenting a proof by contradiction. The assumptions in the proof would be that there are finitely many primes of the form 4n+3, say p1, p2, ..., pk. Then they construct N = 4*p1*p2*...*pk - 1. The first assumption would be that there are only finitely many primes of that form. Then N is constructed as a number of the form 4n+3. The next part of the proof states that N is not prime and thus must be divisible by a prime. The user questions how that conclusion is reached. Then, since none of the primes p_i divide N, any prime dividing N must be of the form 4n+1, which the user also questions why. The contradiction arises because the product of numbers of the form 4n+1 is also of that form, contradicting N's form. Then there's a follow-up question about why this proof fails for 4n+1 primes.\n\nSo the main problem is to prove there are infinitely many primes of the form 4n+3. The assumptions in the proof include:\n\n1. Suppose there are finitely many primes of the form 4n+3, say p1, ..., pk.\n2. Let N = 4*p1*...*pk - 1.\n3. N is of the form 4n+3.\n4. N is not prime.\n5. Therefore, N is divisible by some prime.\n6. None of the primes p1, ..., pk divide N.\n7. Any prime dividing N must be of the form 4n+1.\n8. The product of numbers of the form 4n+1 is also of that form.\n\nBut the user's questions are about steps 5, 7, and the follow-up. However, in the formatting example, the assumptions are the given conditions and premises in the problem, not the steps of the proof. Wait, the example given by the user was about the divisibility by 91, where the assumptions included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in that example, the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7. Wait, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, the expression is divisible by 91. However, in the formatted problem, the assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". But wait, that's actually incorrect because the original problem didn't have that condition. Wait, maybe there was a mistake in the example. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal problem in the example says: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut in the formatted problem, the assumption is n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that's adding an assumption not present in the original problem. That might be an error. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the only assumption is n is an integer. The fact that the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" might be incorrect. So perhaps the example has a mistake. Wait, but maybe the user intended to include that? Maybe the original problem had a typo. Hmm. Well, regardless, in the current problem, the task is to structure the problem as per the example.\n\nIn the current problem, the user is presenting a proof and asking specific questions. However, the task is to filter the unrelated information and structure the problem according to the format. The problem statement here is the original problem: \"Prove that there are infinitely many primes of the form 4n+3.\" The assumptions in the proof are part of the proof steps. But the example given by the user includes assumptions from the problem's premises. So perhaps in this case, the assumptions are the premises used in the proof's setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the original problem is the proof provided, and the user wants to structure the problem based on the proof steps. The problem here is to answer the three questions embedded in the proof. However, according to the user's instruction, the task is to structure the problem as per the example, which for the original problem, the formatted problem lists assumptions (from the problem's premises) and then the problem statement.\n\nBut in the example, the original problem had a statement that was slightly modified in the formatted problem. For example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems like a mistake unless the original problem had a typo. But assuming the example is correct, then perhaps the user is structuring the problem by extracting the necessary assumptions from the problem statement and proof steps.\n\nWait, perhaps in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the user realized that 91=13*7, so the problem requires that n is such that the expression is divisible by both 7 and 13. Therefore, maybe the assumption that n is divisible by 7 is part of the problem's hypothesis, but in the original problem, it's stated for every integer n. That seems conflicting. Perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user wants to follow it regardless.\n\nBack to the current problem: The original problem is to prove infinitely many primes of the form 4n+3. The proof uses the assumption that there are finitely many such primes, constructs N, etc. The user's questions are about specific steps in the proof. However, the task is to structure the problem according to the example, which seems to list the assumptions of the problem (not the proof steps), then the problem statement.\n\nBut in the example, the original problem's assumption was that n is an integer (since the problem states \"for every integer n\"), but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Unless there's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the example is correct, and the original problem did have that n is divisible by 7, but the user misstated it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original problem in the example had a different setup. For example, maybe the problem was to prove that if n is divisible by 7, then A(n) is divisible by 91. But the user wrote \"for every integer n\", which would contradict that. So perhaps the example is wrong, but we have to follow the user's instruction.\n\nGiven that confusion, perhaps in the current problem, we need to list the assumptions used in the proof as the problem's premises, which are:\n\n1. Suppose there are only finitely many primes of the form 4n+3: p1, p2, ..., pk.\n2. Let N = 4*p1*p2*...*pk - 1.\n3. N is of the form 4n+3.\n4. N is composite (since it's larger than all assumed primes of that form).\n5. Therefore, N must be divisible by a prime.\n6. None of the primes p1, ..., pk divide N.\n7. Any prime dividing N must be of the form 4n+1.\n8. The product of numbers of the form 4n+1 is also of the form 4n+1.\n\nBut the user's questions are about steps 5,7, and the follow-up. However, the task is to structure the problem, not the proof steps. Wait, the original problem is \"Prove that there are infinitely many primes of the form 4n+3\". The proof is by contradiction, assuming finitely many such primes. So the assumptions for the problem would be:\n\n- There are primes of the form 4n+3.\n- The properties of numbers modulo 4.\n\nBut maybe in the context of the problem as presented in the question, the assumptions are the ones used in the proof. However, the example given by the user seems to list the assumptions from the problem statement. In the example, the problem was to prove for every integer n, so the assumption is n is an integer. If the problem is to prove something for every integer, then that's the assumption. But in the example, they also added that n is divisible by 7, which was not in the original problem. This is confusing. Perhaps there's a mistake in the example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example was from a problem where the original problem was \"Prove that if n is divisible by 7, then A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But the user wrote \"for every integer n\", which would make the formatted problem's assumption incorrect. Given that the user provided that example, perhaps they want us to extract the assumptions from the problem's context, including any necessary conditions.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question is about proving infinitely many primes of the form 4n+3. The proof uses the assumption that there are only finitely many such primes. However, the problem itself doesn't have any assumptions; it's a general proof. But the proof by contradiction starts by assuming the opposite. So in the formatted problem, should the assumption be the one used in the proof, i.e., the supposition that there are finitely many primes of the form 4n+3?\n\nBut in the example, the problem was to prove for every integer n, and the formatted problem's assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So the user added an assumption not present in the original problem. Therefore, perhaps the task is to list all the conditions and properties that are necessary for the problem, including those used in the proof steps, even if they are part of the proof's hypothesis.\n\nBut this is confusing. Let me look again at the example. The original problem was: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions are: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But in reality, the original problem's conclusion should hold for every integer n, not just those divisible by 7. So the example seems incorrect. However, the user might have intended that the problem has some hidden assumptions, such as requiring n to be such that 7 divides the expression, hence n must satisfy certain conditions. But without more context, it's unclear.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the user wants to extract the assumptions that are implicitly used in the problem's solution. For instance, in the example, maybe the problem requires n to be an integer, and the expression is divisible by 91=7*13, so the solution might involve showing divisibility by both 7 and 13, which requires n to satisfy certain congruence conditions. But the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumptions would just be that n is an integer. Therefore, the example provided by the user might have an error, but we have to proceed as per their instruction.\n\nIn the current problem, the main problem is to prove that there are infinitely many primes of the form 4n+3. The proof provided uses the assumption that there are finitely many such primes. So perhaps the assumptions to list are:\n\n1. Suppose there are only finitely many primes of the form 4n+3: p1, p2, ..., pk.\n2. Let N = 4p1p2...pk - 1.\n3. N is of the form 4n+3.\n4. N is composite.\n5. N is divisible by a prime.\n6. None of the primes p1, ..., pk divide N.\n7. Any prime dividing N must be of the form 4n+1.\n8. The product of numbers of the form 4n+1 is of the form 4n+1.\n\nBut the problem statement is \"Prove that there are infinitely many primes of the form 4n+3\". However, the user's questions are about specific steps in the proof. But according to the format, the problem should be restated, and the assumptions listed. The example included the problem's main statement and any assumptions used in it. However, in the example, the assumptions might not have been correctly extracted. Given that, perhaps the correct approach here is to list the assumptions that are given in the problem statement. But the problem statement here is the same as the title: \"Infinitely many primes of the form 4n+3\". The proof is the user's own proof attempt, which includes certain steps. But the problem itself doesn't have explicit assumptions; it's a general theorem. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions are the ones used in the proof by contradiction, i.e., the supposition that there are only finitely many primes of the form 4n+3.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about the variables in the problem. So for the current problem, since the proof starts by assuming there are finitely many primes of the form 4n+3, perhaps that is the key assumption. However, the user's questions are about the steps within the proof, such as \"How did they get to this conclusion?\" regarding N being divisible by a prime, and \"Why must it be of this form?\" regarding primes dividing N being of the form 4n+1, and the follow-up about why the proof fails for 4n+1.\n\nBut the task is to structure the problem as per the example, which includes listing assumptions and the problem statement. Given that, perhaps the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem setup. Since the problem is to prove the infinitude of primes of the form 4n+3, the main assumption would be the opposite (for contradiction), but that's part of the proof method. The problem itself doesn't have assumptions beyond standard number theory. Therefore, maybe there are no explicit assumptions, but the problem is to answer the three questions embedded in the proof. However, the user's instruction says to structure the problem as per the example, which includes an Assumption section and a Problem section.\n\nGiven the confusion from the example, perhaps the safest way is to extract the problem statement and list any assumptions made in the problem's statement. Since the problem statement is \"Prove that there are infinitely many primes of the form 4n+3\", there are no explicit assumptions beyond standard number theory axioms. However, in the proof provided, the user starts by assuming finitely many primes of that form. Therefore, perhaps the assumption is that there are finitely many primes of the form 4n+3, and then the problem is to derive a contradiction from that assumption, thereby proving the infinitude.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about the variable n in the problem. So perhaps in this case, since the problem is a general theorem, there are no explicit assumptions, and the problem statement is as is. However, the user's proof attempt uses certain steps, and the questions are about those steps. But according to the format, we need to list assumptions and the problem. Since the example included assumptions that might not have been present in the original problem, perhaps the user wants to list the key mathematical properties used in the proof as assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions are the key properties used in the proof, such as:\n\n- Any integer of the form 4n+3 must have at least one prime divisor of the form 4n+3.\n- The product of two numbers of the form 4n+1 is also of the form 4n+1.\n\nBut the original proof's steps use these properties. However, in the problem statement, these are not assumptions but rather facts to be used. Since the user is asking for clarification on these steps, perhaps the problem is to answer those specific questions within the proof. But according to the user's instructions, the task is to structure the problem as per the example, which seems to focus on the problem's explicit assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to follow the example's structure even if it's flawed. In the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. So perhaps the user wants to list all conditions that are necessary for the problem, even if they're part of the proof's steps. For the current problem:\n\nThe problem is to prove infinitely many primes of the form 4n+3. The proof uses the assumption that there are finitely many such primes, constructs N = 4p1...pk -1, which is of the form 4n+3, composite, and then states it's divisible by a prime, none of the pi divide it, so primes dividing N must be of the form 4n+1, leading to a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. There are finitely many primes of the form 4n+3: p1, p2, ..., pk.\n2. N = 4*p1*p2*...*pk - 1.\n3. N is of the form 4n+3.\n4. N is composite.\n5. Any composite number must be divisible by a prime.\n6. None of the primes p1, ..., pk divide N.\n7. Any prime divisor of N must be of the form 4n+1.\n8. The product of numbers of the form 4n+1 is of the form 4n+1.\n\nBut this seems too detailed. The example's assumptions were more concise. In the example, the assumptions were about the variable n in the problem statement. Similarly, here, the problem is to prove the infinitude, so perhaps the assumptions are the properties used in the proof that are taken for granted. For example:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- The number N = 4*p1*p2*...*pk -1 is composite.\n- Any composite number must have a prime divisor.\n- Primes not of the form 4n+3 must be of the form 4n+1.\n- The product of numbers of the form 4n+1 is also of that form.\n\nBut these are more like steps in the proof or lemmas rather than assumptions. The user's questions are about these steps: why N must be divisible by a prime (which is a general property of composite numbers), why the prime must be of the form 4n+1 (which relates to the fact that all primes are either 4n+1 or 4n+3, and since none of the 4n+3 primes divide N, the remaining must be 4n+1), and why the proof fails for 4n+1 (because constructing a similar N would result in a number of the form 4n+1, which could be divisible by primes of the form 4n+3, leading to no contradiction).\n\nBut the task is to structure the problem, not to answer the questions. The user will answer in another part. So according to the example, we need to list the assumptions and the problem. The problem here is the original theorem to prove, and the assumptions are the premises used in the proof.\n\nBut the original problem statement is just \"Prove that there are infinitely many primes of the form 4n+3.\" There are no explicit assumptions given in the problem statement. The assumptions come into play in the proof by contradiction. Therefore, perhaps the only assumption is the one used in the contradiction: \"there are finitely many primes of the form 4n+3\". However, in the example, the assumptions were properties of the variable n (integer, divisible by 7). So perhaps the assumptions here are:\n\n- There are finitely many primes of the form 4n+3.\n- N = 4*p1*...*pk -1 is of the form 4n+3.\n- N is composite.\n- Any composite number is divisible by a prime.\n- None of the primes p1,...,pk divide N.\n- All primes are either of the form 4n+1 or 4n+3.\n- The product of numbers of the form 4n+1 is of the same form.\n\nBut again, these are steps in the proof, not assumptions of the problem. This is confusing. Given the example's structure, perhaps the correct approach is to list the key assumptions used in the proof as per the problem's context. Since the problem is to prove the infinitude, and the proof uses constructing N=4p1...pk-1, the assumptions would be:\n\n- There are finitely many primes of the form 4n+3.\n- N is constructed as 4 times the product of these primes minus 1.\n- N is of the form 4n+3.\n- N is composite.\n\nBut these are steps in the proof, not assumptions. The user's questions are about these steps. However, the task is to structure the problem as per the example, which in the case of the divisibility problem, listed assumptions about n. Here, perhaps the only assumption is that there are finitely many primes of the form 4n+3, and the problem is to derive a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, considering the example's potential error, perhaps the user wants to list the problem's conditions. Since the problem is to prove the infinitude of primes of the form 4n+3, the assumptions might include properties of numbers modulo 4, but those are standard in number theory. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- All primes are either of the form 4n+1 or 4n+3.\n- The product of two numbers of the form 4n+1 is also of that form.\n\nBut again, these are general properties, not assumptions of the problem. Given the ambiguity, I think the best approach is to follow the example, even if flawed. The example included assumptions that were part of the proof's steps. Therefore, here, the assumptions would include:\n\n- There are finitely many primes of the form 4n+3: p1, p2, ..., pk.\n- N = 4p1p2...pk - 1 is of the form 4n+3.\n- N is composite.\n- N is divisible by a prime.\n- None of the primes p1, ..., pk divide N.\n- Any prime dividing N must be of the form 4n+1.\n- The product of numbers of the form 4n+1 is of the form 4n+1.\n\nBut that's too detailed. The example had two assumptions. Given that, perhaps the key assumptions are:\n\n- There are finitely many primes of the form 4n+3.\n- The number N = 4 times their product minus 1 is of the form 4n+3 and composite.\n\nProblem: Prove that there are infinitely many primes of the form 4n+3.\n\nHowever, the user's questions are about specific steps in the proof. But according to the instructions, the task is to structure the problem, not the proof's questions. The user might have intended to list the problem's assumptions and the problem statement, ignoring the embedded questions. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: \nThere are only finitely many primes of the form $4n+3$,\n$N = 4p_1p_2\\cdots p_k - 1$ is of the form $4n+3$,\n$N$ is composite.\nProblem: \nProve that there are infinitely many primes of the form $4n+3$.\n\nBut this omits some steps. Alternatively, considering the example, which took the problem statement and added an assumption (even if incorrectly), perhaps the assumptions here are the conditions given in the problem's proof steps. However, since the problem is a general proof, there are no explicit assumptions beyond standard math axioms. Given that, perhaps the only assumption is the one used for contradiction: finitely many primes of the form 4n+3. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nThere are finitely many primes of the form $4n+3$.\nProblem:\nProve that there are infinitely many primes of the form $4n+3$.\n\nBut this seems minimal.
