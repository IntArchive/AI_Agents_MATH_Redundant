    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me start by reading the original question carefully.\n\nThe user is asking about an inequality involving arithmetic and geometric means. The title mentions an \"AGM-GAM\" inequality, which probably stands for Arithmetic Mean of Geometric Means versus Geometric Mean of Arithmetic Means. \n\nThe problem states: For positive real numbers x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ and any 1 ≤ r ≤ n, let A_r and G_r be the arithmetic mean and geometric mean of the first r terms, respectively. The question is whether the arithmetic mean of G₁, G₂, ..., G_n is never greater than the geometric mean of A₁, A₂, ..., A_n. The user mentions it's obvious for n=2 and they have a cumbersome proof for n=3, but they want to know if it's true in general.\n\nFirst, I need to extract all the assumptions. The assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\n1. All x₁, x₂, ..., x_n are positive real numbers. That's a key condition because geometric means require positive numbers to be defined.\n2. For each r from 1 to n, A_r is the arithmetic mean of x₁ to x_r. So each A_r is defined as (x₁ + x₂ + ... + x_r)/r.\n3. For each r from 1 to n, G_r is the geometric mean of x₁ to x_r. So G_r is (x₁x₂...x_r)^(1/r).\n4. The problem compares two aggregates: the arithmetic mean of the G_r's and the geometric mean of the A_r's. The question is whether the arithmetic mean of G₁, G₂, ..., G_n is ≤ the geometric mean of A₁, A₂, ..., A_n.\n\nWait, the user says \"the arithmetic mean of G_1, G_2, ..., G_n is never greater than the geometric mean of A_1, A_2, ..., A_n\". So the two aggregates are:\n\n- (G₁ + G₂ + ... + G_n)/n (arithmetic mean of Gs)\n- (A₁A₂...A_n)^(1/n) (geometric mean of As)\n\nThe question is whether (G₁ + ... + G_n)/n ≤ (A₁A₂...A_n)^(1/n).\n\nNow, the assumptions need to list each condition. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nOriginal problem says: For positive real numbers x₁,x₂,…,x_n and any 1≤r≤n let A_r and G_r be, respectively, the arithmetic mean and geometric mean of x₁,x₂,…,x_r. Is it true that the arithmetic mean of G₁,G₂,…,G_n is never greater then the geometric mean of A₁,A₂,…,A_n?\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n- The variables x₁, x₂, ..., x_n are positive real numbers.\n- For each integer r where 1 ≤ r ≤ n, A_r is the arithmetic mean of x₁, x₂, ..., x_r.\n- For each integer r where 1 ≤ r ≤ n, G_r is the geometric mean of x₁, x₂, ..., x_r.\n\nBut the problem is to compare the arithmetic mean of all G_r's and the geometric mean of all A_r's. So the problem statement is to check if (G₁ + G₂ + ... + G_n)/n ≤ (A₁A₂...A_n)^(1/n).\n\nThe user didn't mention any additional conditions like specific values of n beyond the general case. So the assumptions are as above. Each assumption is one line, each addressing one property applied to one object.\n\nWait, but \"for any 1 ≤ r ≤n\" — that's part of the definitions of A_r and G_r. So in the assumptions, do I need to specify that r ranges from 1 to n? Probably yes.\n\nSo structuring:\n\nAssumption:\n- x₁, x₂, ..., x_n are positive real numbers.\n- For each integer r with 1 ≤ r ≤ n, A_r is the arithmetic mean of x₁, x₂, ..., x_r.\n- For each integer r with 1 ≤ r ≤ n, G_r is the geometric mean of x₁, x₂, ..., x_r.\n\nProblem: Is the arithmetic mean of G₁, G₂, ..., G_n never greater than the geometric mean of A₁, A₂, ..., A_n?\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"Is it true that...\", so the problem is to determine the truth of that inequality. So in the formatted problem, it should be phrased as a question? But looking at the example, the problem was phrased as \"Prove that...\". However, in this case, the user is asking if it's true, so maybe the problem statement is \"Is it true that...?\"\n\nBut the example's problem was \"Prove that...\", so perhaps the user wants to structure the problem as a statement to prove, even if the original is a question. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was \"Prove that...\", and the formatted problem kept it as \"Prove that...\". Here, the original is a question: \"Is it true that...?\" So in the formatted problem, should it be \"Determine whether the arithmetic mean... is never greater than...\" or \"Is it true that...\"?\n\nLooking at the user's instruction: \"structure that problem as the following format\". The example shows that even if the original is a \"Prove that...\", it's kept as \"Prove that...\". So likely, the problem should be written as the original question, but phrased as a directive. But in the original here, it's a yes/no question. Hmm.\n\nBut the user's example transformed the original into a \"Prove that...\" statement, but in this case, the original problem is a question. However, the user wants the problem part to be the problem statement. So maybe it's acceptable to write it as \"Is it true that...?\" but perhaps rephrase it as a statement to prove. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, since the user wants to structure it for solving, maybe the problem is to prove or disprove the statement. So perhaps the problem is \"Prove or disprove that the arithmetic mean of G₁, G₂, ..., G_n is never greater than the geometric mean of A₁, A₂, ..., A_n.\"\n\nBut the original question is \"Is it true that...\", which is equivalent to asking for a proof or a counterexample. However, in the example, the problem was a direct statement to prove, so maybe the user expects the problem part to be a statement. But in this case, since the original is a question, perhaps it's better to leave it as \"Is it true that...\".\n\nBut let's check the user's instructions again. They said to structure the problem as per the format. The example's problem was a \"Prove that...\", so maybe even if the original is a question, the problem part should be phrased as a directive. But the user's example had the original problem as a \"Prove that...\", so perhaps here, the problem is to answer the question, so \"Prove whether...\" or \"Determine whether...\".\n\nBut the exact original problem is \"Is it true that...\". To stay true to the original, the problem should be phrased as \"Is it true that...\".\n\nBut the example given by the user had \"Prove that...\". So maybe the assistant should follow the structure of the example, even if the original is a question. Wait, no, the user's example shows that the original problem was a \"Prove that...\" and the formatted problem kept it as \"Prove that...\". So if the original is a question, perhaps the problem part should be the same as the original question. \n\nTherefore, in this case, the problem should be written as:\n\nProblem: Is it true that the arithmetic mean of $G_1, G_2, \\ldots, G_n$ is never greater than the geometric mean of $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_n$?\n\nBut the user's example transformed the original into a problem statement without the question mark, but the example's original was a \"Prove that...\". So perhaps in this case, if the original is a question, we need to keep it as a question. Alternatively, rephrase it as a statement to prove. The user's instruction says: \"structure that problem as the following format\". The example's problem is a statement to prove. But the original here is a yes/no question. Maybe the correct approach is to phrase it as a statement to prove, even if the original is a question. For example, \"Prove that the arithmetic mean... is never greater than...\" because the user is likely seeking a proof.\n\nBut the original question is \"Is it true that...\", so maybe the problem should be \"Determine whether the arithmetic mean... is never greater than...\". However, the example's problem was \"Prove that...\", which is a directive. The user's instruction says \"the problem\" part is the problem. So if the original problem is a question, the problem should be written as that question.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants it phrased as a statement to prove. Since the original problem says \"i have a proof for n=3\" and is asking if it's true in general, the problem is to prove it in general. Therefore, the problem part should be \"Prove that the arithmetic mean of G₁, G₂, ..., G_n is never greater than the geometric mean of A₁, A₂, ..., A_n.\"\n\nBut I need to check the user's example again. The original problem was \"Prove that...\", and the formatted problem was \"Prove that...\". Here, the original problem is a question \"Is it true that...\", so perhaps the problem should be \"Prove or disprove that...\". However, the user's example didn't do that. Alternatively, the user might prefer to convert the question into a statement to prove, assuming the answer is affirmative. Since the user mentions that for n=2 it's obvious and they have a proof for n=3, they are likely expecting it to be true, so the problem is to prove it.\n\nBut to be precise, the problem as stated by the user is a question, so the problem part should reflect that. But the example shows that the problem part is a statement (Prove that...). Therefore, perhaps the correct approach here is to rephrase the question as a directive: \"Prove whether the arithmetic mean... is never greater than...\", but more naturally, \"Prove or disprove that...\".\n\nHowever, the user's example didn't do that. The original example was a \"Prove that...\" and the formatted problem was the same. Here, the original is a question. To adhere strictly to the example's format, perhaps the problem part should be phrased as \"Prove that...\", assuming the answer is yes. But the user hasn't confirmed that yet; the question is whether it's true. So maybe the problem should be \"Determine whether the arithmetic mean... is never greater than...\", but again, the example used \"Prove that...\". \n\nAlternatively, the user might want to present the problem as a conjecture to be proven. Given that the original problem is a yes/no question, but the user's example turned a \"Prove that...\" into a \"Prove that...\", perhaps the problem part here should be \"Prove that the arithmetic mean... is never greater than...\", assuming the answer is yes. However, since the user hasn't confirmed it's true, but they have a proof for n=3, maybe the problem is to prove it in general. \n\nIn any case, the problem as presented by the user is a question, so the problem part should be \"Is it true that...\". But the example's problem was a statement. Therefore, there's a conflict. To resolve this, perhaps the assistant should follow the original structure of the problem. Since the user provided an example where the original problem was a \"Prove that...\", and the formatted problem was also a \"Prove that...\", in this case, if the original is a question, the problem part should be the same question. So:\n\nProblem: Is it true that the arithmetic mean of $G_1, G_2, \\ldots, G_n$ is never greater than the geometric mean of $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_n$?\n\nBut the example's problem was a statement, not a question. However, the user's instruction says to structure the problem as per the example. The example's problem was a \"Prove that...\", which is a directive. The original problem here is a question. So perhaps the assistant should rephrase it as a directive: \"Prove or disprove that...\", which is common in math problems. But the user's example didn't use \"Prove or disprove\", even though the original problem here is a question. Alternatively, maybe the user expects the problem to be stated as a conjecture to prove, hence using \"Prove that...\".\n\nGiven that the user's example transformed the original problem into a \"Prove that...\" statement, even though in this case the original is a question, perhaps the assistant should follow suit and present it as a statement to prove. This is especially since the user mentions they have a proof for n=3 and it's obvious for n=2, implying that they believe it's true and want a general proof. Therefore, the problem part would be:\n\nProblem: Prove that the arithmetic mean of $G_1, G_2, \\ldots, G_n$ is never greater than the geometric mean of $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_n$.\n\nThis seems more in line with the example provided. Even though the original is posed as a question, the user likely wants to structure it as a statement to prove.\n\nSo, compiling all the assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\n- $x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n$ are positive real numbers.\n- For each integer $r$ with $1 \\leq r \\leq n$, $A_r$ is the arithmetic mean of $x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_r$.\n- For each integer $r$ with $1 \\leq r \\leq n$, $G_r$ is the geometric mean of $x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_r$.\n\nProblem: Prove that the arithmetic mean of $G_1, G_2, \\ldots, G_n$ is never greater than the geometric mean of $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_n$.\n\nI need to check if all assumptions are covered. The original problem specifies positive real numbers, which is the first assumption. Then defines A_r and G_r for each r from 1 to n, which are the next two assumptions. The problem statement is to compare the two means as specified. So this should be correct.",
