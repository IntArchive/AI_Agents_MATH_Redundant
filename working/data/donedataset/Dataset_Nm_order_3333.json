    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the user's format. First, I need to read the original question carefully. The user provided an example where they extracted assumptions and the problem statement. My task is to do the same for the new problem from Math Stack Exchange.\n\nThe original title is: \"Prove $\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{k^{\\frac34}}{(1-k^2)^\\frac38} K(k)\\text{d}k=\\frac{\\pi^2}{12}\\sqrt{5+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} } }$\". The question mentions an integral involving the complete elliptic integral of the first kind, K(k). The user also talks about an equivalent integral involving theta functions and some L-series, but the main problem seems to be proving the first integral equals the given expression with pi squared and square roots.\n\nSo, the problem is to prove that specific integral equals that value. The assumptions here would be the conditions under which this integral holds. The integral is from 0 to 1, and the integrand includes K(k), which is defined for 0 ≤ k < 1 (since K(k) is the complete elliptic integral, valid in that range). The exponents on k and (1 - k²) are fractions, but I don't think there are additional constraints unless specified. Since the problem is to compute the integral, the main assumption is that the integral is taken over the interval [0,1], and K(k) is the standard complete elliptic integral of the first kind. There's no mention of specific conditions on other variables here, so maybe the main assumption is just the domain of integration and the definition of K(k). However, in the example given by the user, they had to list assumptions line by line, each about one property applied to one object. \n\nLooking at the example: the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but in the formatted version, they only listed \"n is an integer\". Wait, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, maybe the example had a mistake? Wait, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example? Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions were \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But the original problem states \"for every integer n\", meaning n doesn't need to be divisible by 7. So maybe the example is incorrect. But regardless, the user's instruction is to follow their format. So for the current problem, I need to extract assumptions.\n\nLooking at the integral in the problem: The integrand is (k^{3/4}) / (1 - k^2)^{3/8} multiplied by K(k). The integral is from 0 to 1. The assumptions here would be that k is a real variable between 0 and 1, and that K(k) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind. The exponents 3/4 and 3/8 are constants, so there's no variable conditions there. The problem is to prove the integral equals that specific value. Therefore, the key assumptions are about the integral limits and the definition of K(k).\n\nBut wait, in the example, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem included an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Which contradicts. Hmm. Maybe in the original problem, the user made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the example was a misrepresentation. Wait, perhaps the original problem was missing some conditions, but the formatted one added an assumption. Maybe the example was a different problem. Anyway, perhaps the key is to list the necessary assumptions for the problem to hold. In the current problem, the integral is from 0 to 1, so k is in [0,1], and K(k) is the complete elliptic integral. Maybe those are the assumptions. But since the user's example listed multiple assumptions each on one object, perhaps here:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is over the interval [0, 1],\nk is a real variable,\nK(k) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind.\n\nBut maybe those are too basic. However, in the example, they listed \"n is an integer\" even though the problem statement already mentions \"for every integer n\". So perhaps even if the problem states something, we need to list it in the assumptions. So here, the integral is from 0 to 1, so the assumption would be the limits of integration. Also, the integrand uses K(k), so assuming that K(k) is the standard complete elliptic integral of the first kind. Maybe the exponents 3/4 and 3/8 are given, so no need to list them as assumptions.\n\nSo, structuring:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is taken over the interval [0, 1],\nK(k) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind.\n\nProblem:\nProve that  \n$$\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{k^{\\frac34}}{(1-k^2)^{\\frac38}} K(k)\\, \\text{d}k = \\frac{\\pi^2}{12}\\sqrt{5+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} } }$$\n\nBut in the original problem, the user also mentioned an equivalent integral involving theta functions and L-series. But the main problem to prove is the first integral. The rest seems to be the user's thoughts or equivalent forms. So the problem to structure is the first integral equality. The assumptions would be the integral from 0 to 1 and K(k) as the complete elliptic integral. The other parts (theta functions, L-series) might be part of the solution or methods but not part of the problem statement. The user wants to filter unrelated information. So the problem is to prove that integral equals that value. So the assumptions are as above.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated from 0 to 1,\nK(k) represents the complete elliptic integral of the first kind.\n\nProblem:\nProve that  \n$$\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{k^{\\frac34}}{(1 - k^2)^{\\frac38}} K(k)\\, \\text{d}k = \\frac{\\pi^2}{12} \\sqrt{5 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}}$$",
