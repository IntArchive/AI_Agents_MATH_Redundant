    "Content": "I found an example of a function $f: \\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ that is continuous and bounded, but is not uniformly continuous. It is $\\sin(x^2)$. I think it's not uniformly continuous because the derivative is bigger and bigger as $x$ increases. But I don't know how to prove this is uniformly continuous. Is $\\sin(x^2)$ uniformly continuous then? if it isn't, can you guys think of any other examples? thanks",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "To prove that $f(x)=\\sin(x^2)$ is not uniformly continuous, let $\\epsilon=\\frac{1}{2}$. You want to show that for every $\\delta\\gt 0$ there exists $x$ and $y$ (which may depend on $\\delta$) such that $|x-y|\\lt \\delta$, but $|f(x)-f(y)|\\geq \\frac{1}{2}$. Suggestion: try to pick a $y$ where $f(y)=0$, and a very nearby $x$ where $f(1)=\\pm 1$. You want $y^2=n\\pi$ for some integer $n$, and $x^2$ to be $\\frac{1}{2}\\pi$ away.  If you cannot produce a pair explicitly, maybe you can show that you can pick them as close as you want anyway, provided $x$ and $y$ are large enough (which agrees with your observation that the derivative is unbounded).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user is asking about an example of a function that's continuous and bounded on the real line but not uniformly continuous. They mentioned sin(x²) and are unsure if it's uniformly continuous or not, and if not, they want to confirm it as an example or think of another one.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the definitions. A function is uniformly continuous on a set if, for every epsilon > 0, there exists a delta > 0 such that for any two points in the set, whenever their distance is less than delta, the difference in their function values is less than epsilon. This has to hold uniformly across the entire set. In contrast, regular continuity allows delta to depend on the point as well as epsilon.\n\nNow, sin(x²) is definitely continuous because it's a composition of continuous functions. The sine function is bounded between -1 and 1, so that's covered. The question is about uniform continuity. \n\nThe user thinks the derivative becomes unbounded as x increases, which might be why it's not uniformly continuous. Let's check the derivative of sin(x²): using the chain rule, it's 2x cos(x²). The derivative's magnitude is |2x cos(x²)|, which is bounded by 2|x|. As x approaches infinity, this derivative can become very large. However, having an unbounded derivative doesn't necessarily imply that the function isn't uniformly continuous. For example, sqrt(x) on [0, ∞) is uniformly continuous but its derivative becomes unbounded as x approaches 0. Wait, no, that's not the case. Actually, sqrt(x) is uniformly continuous on [0, ∞) even though its derivative becomes infinite at x=0. So maybe the derivative being unbounded isn't the right approach here.\n\nAlternatively, to prove that a function is not uniformly continuous, one can use the definition: find an epsilon > 0 such that for every delta > 0, there exist points x and y with |x - y| < delta but |f(x) - f(y)| ≥ epsilon.\n\nFor sin(x²), maybe we can choose specific sequences of points where the function oscillates rapidly. For example, as x becomes large, x² increases, and the function sin(x²) oscillates more and more rapidly. Let's consider x_n = sqrt(nπ + π/2) and y_n = sqrt(nπ). Then x_n² - y_n² = π/2. The difference between sin(x_n²) and sin(y_n²) would be sin(nπ + π/2) - sin(nπ) = 1 - 0 = 1. However, the difference between x_n and y_n would be sqrt(nπ + π/2) - sqrt(nπ). Let's compute that:\n\nsqrt(nπ + π/2) - sqrt(nπ) = [sqrt(nπ + π/2) - sqrt(nπ)] ≈ (π/2)/(2 sqrt(nπ)) by the approximation sqrt(a + b) - sqrt(a) ≈ b/(2 sqrt(a)) for small b. So this difference is approximately π/(4 sqrt(nπ)) = sqrt(π)/(4 sqrt(n)) which approaches 0 as n increases. Therefore, for any delta > 0, we can choose n large enough so that |x_n - y_n| < delta, but |sin(x_n²) - sin(y_n²)| = 1. Hence, sin(x²) is not uniformly continuous on ℝ.\n\nTherefore, the example given by the user, sin(x²), is indeed a valid example of a function that is continuous and bounded on ℝ but not uniformly continuous. The key is the increasing oscillation frequency as x increases, leading to the failure of uniform continuity.\n\nAlternatively, other examples might include sin(e^x), but I need to check. Wait, sin(e^x) would also have an unbounded derivative because the derivative is e^x cos(e^x), which grows exponentially. However, similar reasoning applies: as x increases, e^x increases rapidly, so the argument of the sine function increases rapidly, leading to rapid oscillations. So perhaps sin(e^x) is another example, but the user's example of sin(x²) is correct.\n\nTherefore, the problem can be structured by listing the assumptions that f is defined from ℝ to ℝ, f is continuous, f is bounded, and the problem is to show that f is not uniformly continuous. The specific example here is sin(x²), so the assumptions would be about f(x) = sin(x²), its continuity, boundedness, and then the problem is to show it's not uniformly continuous.",
