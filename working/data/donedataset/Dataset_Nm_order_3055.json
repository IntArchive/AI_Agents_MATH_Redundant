    "AcceptedAnswer": "This is one of the well know examples of Weierstrass function. Hardy studied Hölder-continuity of such functions in Weierstrass's nondifferentiable function, G.H. Hardy, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., 17 (1916), 301–325. . Here is a proof of Hölder-continuity for your case. Theorem. Let $0<a<1$, $b>1$ and $ab>1$ then the function\n$$\nf(x)=\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^\\infty a^n\\cos(b^n x)\n$$\nis $(-\\log_b a)$-Hölder continuous. Proof. Consider $x\\in\\mathbb{R}$ and $h\\in(-1,1)$, then\n$$\nf(x+h)-f(x)=\n\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^\\infty a^{n}(\\cos(b^n(x+h))-\\cos(b^nx))=\n$$\n$$\n-2\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^\\infty a^{n}\\sin(2^{-1}b^n(2x+h))\\sin(2^{-1}b^{n}h)=\n$$\nSince $b>1$ and $h\\in(-1,1)$ there exist $p\\in\\mathbb{N}$ such that $2^{-1}b^{p}|h|\\leq 1<b^p|h|$, so\n$$\n|f(x+h)-f(x)|\\leq\n2\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^\\infty a^{n}|\\sin(2^{-1}b^{n}(2x+h))||\\sin(2^{-1}b^{n}h)|\\leq\n2\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^\\infty a^{n}|\\sin(2^{-1}b^{n}h)|=\n$$\n$$\n2\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^p a^{n}|\\sin(2^{-1}b^{n}h)|+\n2\\sum\\limits_{n=p+1}^\\infty a^{n}|\\sin(2^{-1}b^{n}h)|\\leq\n2\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^p a^{n}|2^{-1}b^{n}h|+\n2\\sum\\limits_{n=p+1}^\\infty a^{n}=\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{ab|h|}{ab-1}(a^p b^p-1)+\\frac{2a}{1-a}a^p\\leq\n\\frac{ab|h|}{ab-1}a^p b^p+\\frac{2a}{1-a}a^p\n$$\nSince $2^{-1}b^{p}|h|\\leq 1<b^p|h|$ and $0<a<1$, then we have $b^p|h|<2$ and $a^p\\leq |h|^{-\\log_b a}$. Hence\n$$\n|f(x+h)-f(x)|\\leq\n\\frac{ab|h|}{ab-1}a^p b^p+\\frac{2a}{1-a}a^p\\leq\n\\frac{2ab}{ab-1}a^p +\\frac{2a}{1-a}a^p\\leq\n$$\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{2ab}{ab-1} +\\frac{2a}{1-a}\\right)|h|^{-\\log_b a}=\n\\frac{b-1}{(ab-1)(1-a)}|h|^{-\\log_b a}\n$$\nThis means that $f$ is $(-\\log_b a)$-Hölder continuous. Corollary. For $\\alpha\\in(0,1)$ the function\n$$\nf(x)=\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^\\infty 2^{-n\\alpha}\\cos(2^n x)\n$$\nis $\\alpha$-Hölder continuous. Proof Apply previous theorem with $a=2^{-\\alpha}$ and $b=2$. As for the proof of nowhere differentiability, I don't know a short proof. The problem is that the standard Weierstrass argument is not applicable here - parameters $a$, $b$ must satisfy inequality $ab>1+\\frac{3\\pi}{2}$. So it seems to me that one should repeat all the steps of Hardy's proof.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that the function f(x) = sum_{n=1}^infty 2^{-nα} cos(2^n x) for α in (0,1) is α-Hölder continuous but not differentiable anywhere in [0,1]. \n\nFirst, let's parse the problem and extract the assumptions and the exact statement to prove. The original question mentions that α is between 0 and 1, so that's one assumption. The function is defined as an infinite series with terms involving 2^{-nα} and cos(2^n x). \n\nFor the Hölder continuity part, we need to show there exists a constant C such that |f(x+h) - f(x)| ≤ C|h|^α for all x in [0,1] and h such that x+h is also in [0,1]. To approach this, maybe use the properties of the series. Each term has 2^{-nα}, and the cosine terms might be bounded using their derivatives or some trigonometric identity. For instance, the difference cos(2^n (x+h)) - cos(2^n x) can be written using the formula for cosine differences, which involves sine terms. Then, since |sin| ≤ 1, maybe bound the difference by something involving 2^n |h|, leading to a term like 2^{-nα} * 2^n |h|. Summing over n, if that's the case, would give a geometric series with ratio 2^{1 - α}, which converges if α < 1. Wait, but α is in (0,1), so 1 - α is positive, making the ratio 2^{1 - α} > 1, so the series would diverge. Hmm, that suggests maybe my initial approach is wrong. Alternatively, maybe using the mean value theorem on the cosine difference, giving a bound of 2^n |h| * |sin(ξ)|, which is ≤ 2^n |h|. Then multiply by 2^{-nα}, so each term is 2^{n(1 - α)} |h|. Summing that from n=1 to infinity. But again, unless |h| is scaled appropriately. Wait, if we fix h and sum over n, but maybe we need a different approach. Perhaps splitting the sum into two parts: n ≤ N and n > N, where N is chosen such that 2^N |h| ≈ 1. Then for n ≤ N, use the 2^{n(1 - α)} |h| bound, and for n > N, use the fact that 2^{-nα} * |cos(...) - cos(...)| ≤ 2*2^{-nα}. Then the total sum would be bounded by C |h|^α. That seems like a standard technique for Hölder continuity in such series.\n\nFor the non-differentiability part, that's trickier. Usually, functions defined by such lacunary series (with rapidly increasing frequencies) are nowhere differentiable. The classic example is the Weierstrass function. The approach here might involve assuming differentiability at a point and deriving a contradiction. Suppose f is differentiable at some x in [0,1]. Then the difference quotient (f(x+h) - f(x))/h should approach a limit as h→0. However, considering the series term by term, each term contributes something oscillating rapidly as h approaches zero. For high n, the term 2^{-nα} cos(2^n (x + h)) has a derivative term involving -2^{n(1 - α)} sin(2^n x). If the series of derivatives converges, then f would be differentiable, but since α < 1, 2^{n(1 - α)} grows exponentially, so the series diverges. Hence, the derivative doesn't exist. But need to formalize this argument, perhaps using uniform convergence or considering the lim sup of the difference quotient.\n\nNow, structuring the assumptions: The problem states α is in (0,1), the function is defined as the given series, and we need to prove two things: α-Hölder continuity and nowhere differentiability. The assumptions should list each condition on each object. So, α is in (0,1), the function f is defined by that series, and the interval is [0,1]. Each assumption should be a single line addressing one property of one object.",
