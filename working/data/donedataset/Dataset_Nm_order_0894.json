    "Content": "$X$ is a matrix. Let $v$ be an eigenvector of $X$ with corresponding eigenvalue $a$. Show that $v$ is also an eigenvector of $e^{X}$ with eigenvalue $e^{a}$ If $X$ is diagonalizable, then we can start writing out terms using Taylor expansion of $e^{X}$ but I can't seem to get anywhere. Thanks for the help Edit: Corrected question to read ' Let $v$ be an eigenvector of $X$' instead of ' Let $v$ be an eigenvector of $e^X$'.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You don't need to assume that $X$ is diagonalisable to use the \"Taylor expansion\". By definition, \n$$\n\\exp(X) = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k!} X^k\n$$\nAlso, if $Xv = av$, then $X^2v = X(Xv) = aXv = a^2v$, etc. By induction, $X^n v = a^n v$. Hence\n$$\n\\exp(X)v \n= \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k!} X^k \\right)v \n= \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k!} X^k v \n= \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k!} a^k v \n= \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k!} a^k \\right) v = e^a v. \n$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure with Assumptions and Problem. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The title is \"Eigenvector and eigenvalue for exponential matrix\". The question states: Let $v$ be an eigenvector of $X$ with corresponding eigenvalue $a$. Show that $v$ is also an eigenvector of $e^{X}$ with eigenvalue $e^{a}$. The user then mentions that if $X$ is diagonalizable, they tried using Taylor expansion but didn't get anywhere. They also corrected their question to clarify that $v$ is an eigenvector of $X$, not $e^X$.\n\nNow, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that $v$ is an eigenvector of matrix $X$ with eigenvalue $a$. The task is to show that $v$ is an eigenvector of $e^X$ with eigenvalue $e^a$. However, in the user's thought process, they mention assuming $X$ is diagonalizable. But wait, the original problem as corrected doesn't specify that $X$ is diagonalizable. The user tried using that assumption but maybe the problem doesn't require it. The key here is that the problem might not need the diagonalizable condition. So, perhaps the only assumptions are that $v$ is an eigenvector of $X$ with eigenvalue $a$, and $X$ is any matrix (since diagonalizable is not mentioned in the problem statement, only in the user's attempt). \n\nWait, but the problem as stated by the user after correction is: \"Let $v$ be an eigenvector of $X$ with corresponding eigenvalue $a$. Show that $v$ is also an eigenvector of $e^{X}$ with eigenvalue $e^{a}$.\" There's no mention of diagonalizable in the problem statement itself. The user tried assuming diagonalizable but couldn't proceed. So, the actual problem doesn't require $X$ to be diagonalizable. Therefore, the assumption should only be that $v$ is an eigenvector of $X$ with eigenvalue $a$, and $X$ is a matrix (which is implied). The problem is to show that $v$ is an eigenvector of $e^X$ with eigenvalue $e^a$.\n\nWait, but sometimes when dealing with matrix exponentials, people use the Taylor expansion, which requires convergence. However, the exponential of a matrix is defined for any square matrix, diagonalizable or not. So, the problem doesn't need the diagonalizable assumption. The user tried using diagonalizable, maybe thinking that simplifies the proof, but actually, the general proof can be done without that condition. Therefore, the formatted problem should list the assumption that $v$ is an eigenvector of $X$ with eigenvalue $a$, and the problem is to show it's an eigenvector of $e^X$ with $e^a$ as eigenvalue. The user's mention of diagonalizable is part of their attempt, not part of the problem's assumptions. So the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption:\n$v$ is an eigenvector of $X$ with eigenvalue $a$.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $v$ is also an eigenvector of $e^{X}$ with eigenvalue $e^{a}$.\n\nBut wait, the original problem's user mentioned in their edit that they corrected the question to say \"Let $v$ be an eigenvector of $X$\" instead of $e^X$. So the problem as posed is correct now. Therefore, the assumptions and problem are as above.",
