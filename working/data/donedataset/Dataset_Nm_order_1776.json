    "Content": "$\\newcommand{\\R}{\\mathbf R}$\nLet $V$ be an $n$-dimensional vector space and $k$ be an integer less than $n$. A $k$- frame in $V$ is an injective linear map $T:\\R^k\\to V$. Let the set of all the $k$-frames in $V$ be denoted by $F_k(V)$. It is clear that $F_k(V)$ is an open subset of $L(\\R^k, V)$. Define a relation $\\sim$ on $F_k(V)$ as follows: We write $S\\sim T$ for two members $S$ and $T$ in $F_k(V)$ if and only if $\\text{span }T=\\text{span }S$. It can be easily seen that $S\\sim T$ if and only if there is a $\\tau\\in GL_k(\\R)$ such that $T=S\\circ \\tau$. The Grassmannian manifold $GR_k(V)$ is defined as the quotient space $F_k(V)/\\sim$. I know that the projection map $\\pi:F_k(V)\\to GR_k(\\R)$ is an open map. I am trying to prove that $GR_k(V)$ is a Hausdorff space. I proved the above by noting that the above statement is just this: Given linearly independent lists $(u_1, \\ldots, u_k)$ and $(v_1, \\ldots, v_k)$ in $V$ which do not span the same subspace, there are neighborhoods $U_i$'s of $u_i$'s and $V_j$'s of $v_j$'s such that whenever $(u_1',\\ldots, u_k')\\in U_1\\times \\cdots\\times U_k$ and $(v_1',\\ldots, v_k')\\in V_1\\times \\cdots\\times V_k$, the lists $(u_1', \\ldots, u_k')$ and $(v_1', \\ldots, v_k')$ are linearly independent and do not span the same subspace. I had a rather long proof of this. Basically I established that given hyperplanes $H$ and $K$ in $V$, there is a hyperplane $P$ in $V$ such that $P$ is \"between\" $H$ and $K$. I am looking for a more direct approach than recasting the problem in the aformentioned way. edit: Also, I am trying to avoid the use of matrices and coordinates as much as possible. Thanks. EDIT. I finally was able to put down the kind of proof I was looking for. Here it is.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here's an alternative way to deal with the topology : work with orthonormal $k$-frames instead! That is, pick an inner product $\\langle-|-\\rangle$ on $V$ and study the by the Stieffel manifold of orthonormal $k$-frames\n$$V_k(V)=\\lbrace (v_1,\\dots,v_k)\\in V^k\\mid\\langle v_i\\mid v_j\\rangle=\\delta_{ij}\\rbrace$$\nThe equivalence relation induced by that on $F_k(V)$ now coincides with the one coming from the natural action of the matrix group $O(k)$. The advantage of this approach is that the quotient is automatically Hausdorff: Lemma. Suppose $G$ is a compact group (Hausdorff not needed), and $X$ is a Hausdorff space with a continuous group action $\\rho:G\\times X\\to X$. Then $X/G$ is Hausdorff. Proof. Suppose $x,y\\in X$ belong to different $G$-orbits. Our hope is to find two disjoint open neighborhoods of $x$ and $y$ that are unions of orbits. For every $x'\\in G.y$, there exists disjoint open sets $V_{x'}\\ni x'$ and $V_y^{x'}\\ni y$. By continuity of the action, for every $g\\in G$ there exist open sets $O_g\\ni g$ and $V_{x}^g\\ni x$ such that $\\rho(O_g\\times V_{x}^g)\\subset V_{g.x}$. By compactness of $G$, there is a finite open covering $G=\\cup_{i=1}^NO_{g_i}$. Set $W_x=\\cap_{i=1}^NV_{x}^{g_i}$ and $W_y=\\cap_{i=1}^NV_{y}^{g_i.x}$, the claim is that $\\rho(G\\times W_x)$ and $\\rho(G\\times W_y)$ are disjoint open sets, and it's easily checked. Thus the grassmannian of $k$-planes, defined as the quotient the Stieffel-manifold under the action of the matrix group $O(k)$ is Hausdorff. But does this answer your question? It does! First of all note that the grassmannian, as you define it, is compact. This is because there is a contiuous surjection $V_k(V)\\hookrightarrow Fr_k(V)\\rightarrow Gr_k(V)$ : every subspace admits an orthonormal basis. Also, the Gram-Schmidtification map $$\\mathrm{GS}:Fr_k(V)\\to V_k(V)$$ is continuous, and compatible with the equivalence relations, and induces a continuous bijection between your definition of the Grassmannian and mine\n$$\\overbrace{\\widetilde{\\mathrm{GS}}:\\underbrace{Fr_k(V)/\\sim}_{\\text{compact}}\\;\\longrightarrow\\;\\underbrace{V_k(V)/\\sim}_{\\text{Hausdorff}}}^{\\text{continuous bijection}}$$\nHence $\\widetilde{\\mathrm{GS}}$ is a homeomorphism, and your grassmannian is Hausdorff.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants to prove that the Grassmannian manifold GR_k(V) is Hausdorff. They mentioned using the definition of GR_k(V) as the quotient space F_k(V)/~, where F_k(V) is the set of injective linear maps from R^k to V (k-frames), and the equivalence relation ~ is when two k-frames span the same subspace. The projection map π: F_k(V) → GR_k(V) is an open map. \n\nThe user already has a proof by considering neighborhoods around linearly independent lists such that any perturbations in these neighborhoods don't span the same subspace. But they found their own proof long and are looking for a neater approach, avoiding coordinates and matrices as much as possible. They also mention an idea about hyperplanes but want something more direct.\n\nFirst, I need to structure the problem according to the given format. Let's list the assumptions:\n\n1. V is an n-dimensional vector space.\n2. k is an integer less than n.\n3. A k-frame is an injective linear map T: R^k → V.\n4. F_k(V) is the set of all k-frames, which is an open subset of L(R^k, V).\n5. The equivalence relation ~ on F_k(V) is defined by S ~ T if span S = span T.\n6. S ~ T if and only if there exists τ ∈ GL_k(R) such that T = S ∘ τ.\n7. GR_k(V) is the quotient space F_k(V)/~.\n8. The projection map π: F_k(V) → GR_k(V) is open.\n9. The goal is to prove that GR_k(V) is Hausdorff.\n\nWait, the problem statement mentions that π is an open map, which is given. So the user wants to use this fact perhaps. The user's own approach involved neighborhoods around the k-frames such that perturbations don't span the same subspace. But maybe a different approach using properties of the quotient topology and the open projection.\n\nSince GR_k(V) is a quotient space, to prove it's Hausdorff, one standard method is to show that the equivalence relation is closed in F_k(V) × F_k(V), or that the quotient map is open and the relation satisfies certain properties. Alternatively, since the projection is open, maybe we can use the fact that if the quotient is open and the space is Hausdorff, but F_k(V) is a subspace of L(R^k, V), which is a normed space, hence Hausdorff. But the quotient of a Hausdorff space isn't necessarily Hausdorff.\n\nAnother approach: Since the Grassmannian can be embedded into a projective space via the Plücker embedding, which is Hausdorff, hence GR_k(V) is Hausdorff. But the user might want an intrinsic proof without invoking embeddings.\n\nAlternatively, consider that two distinct k-dimensional subspaces can be separated by a continuous function, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, the user wants a proof that uses the given structures, avoiding coordinates. Since the projection is open, perhaps we can separate points in the quotient by open sets. If two points in GR_k(V) are distinct, their pre-images are two equivalence classes in F_k(V). Since F_k(V) is Hausdorff, maybe we can separate these equivalence classes with saturated open sets. But how?\n\nAlternatively, since the Grassmannian has a structure of a manifold, and if we can show it's a differentiable manifold, then it's automatically Hausdorff. But maybe the user is working in topological context.\n\nAnother idea: Use the fact that the equivalence relation is closed. If the relation ~ is closed as a subset of F_k(V) × F_k(V), then the quotient is Hausdorff. So maybe show that the set of pairs (S, T) with span S = span T is closed. How? If we have two sequences S_n → S and T_n → T in F_k(V), and S_n ~ T_n, then does S ~ T? If so, the relation is closed.\n\nSuppose S_n ~ T_n, so span S_n = span T_n. If S_n → S and T_n → T, then span S = span T? Not sure. Because the limit of subspaces might not preserve the span. Wait, but in the Grassmannian, the space of k-dimensional subspaces is compact (if V is finite-dimensional), but maybe that's not helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, since the group GL_k(R) acts on F_k(V) by composition on the right, and the action is free and proper. If the action is proper, then the quotient is Hausdorff. But proving the action is proper might be involved.\n\nAlternatively, construct continuous real-valued functions on GR_k(V) that separate points. For two distinct subspaces W and W', there exists a linear functional or something that distinguishes them.\n\nBut the user wants a direct approach using the definition. Since π is open, maybe for two distinct points [S] and [T] in GR_k(V), we can find open sets around S and T in F_k(V) that are saturated with respect to ~, and whose images under π are disjoint open sets in GR_k(V). Since π is open, this would show Hausdorffness.\n\nTo construct such saturated opens: Since S and T are not equivalent, their spans are different. So there exists a vector in S not in T's span or vice versa. Maybe use this to create disjoint neighborhoods. But how to translate this into the topology of F_k(V).\n\nAlternatively, take a linear functional that separates the two subspaces. For example, if W and W' are two different k-dimensional subspaces, there exists a linear functional f such that f restricted to W and W' have different kernels. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: The Stiefel manifold (which is F_k(V)) is a principal GL_k bundle over the Grassmannian. Since the projection is a quotient map and the group action is by a Lie group, maybe the quotient is Hausdorff. But this might be more advanced than needed.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that in finite-dimensional vector spaces, the Grassmannian is a manifold, hence Hausdorff. But perhaps the user is looking for a topological proof without invoking smooth structures.\n\nThe user mentions they have a proof using hyperplanes and wanting a more direct method. Maybe consider that if two subspaces are different, there exists a vector not in their intersection, and use that to construct separating open sets.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that F_k(V) is an open subset of L(R^k, V), which is a metric space. Then, if two k-frames S and T are not equivalent, their spans are different. So there exists some ε such that any perturbation within ε preserves the non-equivalence, which would give the Hausdorff property in the quotient. But the user mentions they already did something like that but found it long.\n\nThe key is to structure the problem according to the required format. The original problem's assumptions are:\n\n- V is an n-dimensional vector space.\n- k is an integer less than n.\n- A k-frame is an injective linear map from R^k to V.\n- F_k(V) is the set of k-frames, open in L(R^k, V).\n- The equivalence relation ~ is defined by S ~ T iff span S = span T.\n- The Grassmannian GR_k(V) is the quotient F_k(V)/~.\n- The projection π: F_k(V) → GR_k(V) is open.\n- The problem is to prove GR_k(V) is Hausdorff.\n\nSo the assumptions should list each of these points, each on a separate line. The problem is the actual statement to prove.",
