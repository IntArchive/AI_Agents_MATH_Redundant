    "AcceptedAnswer": "Since the full result has not yet been shown, I post this. Here is a proof that $$\n\\limsup_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac1{n^n}\\sum_{k=0}^n\\binom{n}{k}k^{n-k}(n-k)^k\\le\\frac12\\tag{1}\n$$ Using the bound $$\n\\binom{n}{k}\\le\\frac1{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\frac{n^{n+1/2}}{k^{k+1/2}(n-k)^{n-k+1/2}}\\tag{2}\n$$ we get $$\n\\begin{align}\n&\\frac1{n^n}\\sum_{k=0}^n\\binom{n}{k}k^{n-k}(n-k)^k\\\\\n&\\le\\frac1{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\sum_{k=0}^n\\sqrt{\\frac{n\\vphantom{k}}{k(n-k)}}\\left(\\frac{k}{n-k}\\right)^{n-2k}\\\\\n&=\\frac1{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\sum_{k=-n/2}^{n/2}\\sqrt{\\frac{4n^2}{n^2-4k^2}}\\left(\\frac{n+2k}{n-2k}\\right)^{-2k}\\frac1{\\sqrt{n}}\\tag{$k\\mapsto k+n/2$}\\\\\n&=\\frac1{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\sum_{k=-n/2}^{n/2}\\frac2{\\sqrt{1-4k^2/n^2}}\\left(\\frac{1+2k/n}{1-2k/n}\\right)^{-2k}\\frac1{\\sqrt{n}}\\tag{3}\n\\end{align}\n$$ The sum on the right hand side of $(3)$ is a Riemann Sum ( $x=k/\\sqrt{n}$ ) for $$\n\\frac1{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty 2\\,e^{-8x^2}\\,\\mathrm{d}x=\\frac12\\tag{4}\n$$ Towards a full solution Since we are using $x=k/\\sqrt{n}$ , we have that $(3)$ approximates $$\n\\frac1{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\int_{-\\sqrt{n}/2}^{\\sqrt{n}/2}\\frac2{\\sqrt{1-4x^2/n}}\\left(\\frac{1+2x/\\sqrt{n}}{1-2x/\\sqrt{n}}\\right)^{-2x\\sqrt{n}}\\,\\mathrm{d}x\\tag{5}\n$$ As $n$ increases to $\\infty$ , $\\displaystyle\\frac2{\\sqrt{1-4x^2/n}}$ increases to $2$ and $\\displaystyle\\left(\\frac{1+2x/\\sqrt{n}}{1-2x/\\sqrt{n}}\\right)^{-2x\\sqrt{n}}$ increases to $e^{-8x^2}$ . Thus, it is not unreasonable to infer that $(3)$ increases to $\\frac12$ , Abel's Identity As i707107 mentions, Abel's identity is very useful here. In fact, $$\n\\begin{align}\n&\\sum_{k=0}^n\\binom{n}{k}(a+tk)^{k-1}(b-tk)^{n-k}\\\\\n&=\\sum_{k=0}^n\\sum_{j=0}^{n-k}\\binom{n}{k}(a+tk)^{k-1}\\binom{n-k}{j}(-1)^{n-k-j}(a+b)^j(a+tk)^{n-k-j}\\\\\n&=\\sum_{k=0}^n\\sum_{j=0}^{n-k}\\binom{n}{n-k}\\binom{n-k}{j}(a+tk)^{n-j-1}(-1)^{n-k-j}(a+b)^j\\\\\n&=\\sum_{j=0}^n\\sum_{k=0}^{n-j}\\binom{n}{j}\\binom{n-j}{k}(a+tk)^{n-j-1}(-1)^{n-k-j}(a+b)^j\\\\[6pt]\n&=a^{-1}(a+b)^n\\tag{6}\n\\end{align}\n$$ where the last equality is because for $j\\lt n$ , the sum in $k$ is an $n-j$ repeated difference of an $n-j-1$ degree polynomial in $k$ , hence $0$ , and for $j=n$ , the sum in $k$ is a single term. Set $a=n$ , $b=0$ , and $t=-1$ in $(6)$ to get $$\n\\sum_{k=0}^n\\binom{n}{k}(n-k)^{k-1}k^{n-k}=n^{n-1}\\tag{7}\n$$ The inequality is true for $n=1$ , i.e. $0\\le\\frac12$ , but false for $n=0$ . Let's assume that $n\\ge2$ so that we can leave out the $k=0$ and $k=n$ terms of Abel's identity since they are $0$ . Then $$\n\\begin{align}\n&\\sum_{k=0}^n\\binom{n}{k}(n-k)^kk^{n-k}\\\\\n&=\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\\binom{n}{k}(n-k)^kk^{n-k}\\\\\n&=\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\\binom{n}{k}(n-k)^{k-1}(n-k)k^{n-k}\\\\\n&=n\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\\binom{n}{k}(n-k)^{k-1}k^{n-k}\n-\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\\binom{n}{k}(n-k)^kk^{n-k}\\frac{k}{n-k}\\\\\n&=n\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\\binom{n}{k}(n-k)^{k-1}k^{n-k}\n-\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\\binom{n}{k}(n-k)^kk^{n-k}\\frac{n-k}{k}\\\\\n&=n^n-\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\\binom{n}{k}(n-k)^kk^{n-k}\\frac12\\left(\\frac{k}{n-k}+\\frac{n-k}{k}\\right)\\\\\n&\\le n^n-\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\\binom{n}{k}(n-k)^kk^{n-k}\\\\\n&=n^n-\\sum_{k=0}^n\\binom{n}{k}(n-k)^kk^{n-k}\\tag{8}\n\\end{align}\n$$ The last inequality is because $\\frac12\\left(x+\\frac1x\\right)\\ge1$ for $x\\gt0$ . Adding the left side of $(8)$ to both sides and dividing by $2$ yields $$\n\\sum_{k=0}^n\\binom{n}{k}(n-k)^kk^{n-k}\\le\\frac12n^n\\tag{9}\n$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange problem into their specified format. The example they provided shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. The problem statement is then written clearly.\n\nLooking at the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, but in the formatted version, only the integer part was kept as an assumption, and the divisibility by 7 was perhaps part of the problem? Wait, no. Wait, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem in the example lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, but that seems incorrect because the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe the example was modified. Hmm, maybe the example has an error. Wait, in the original example, the user wrote:\n\nOriginal problem:\nProve that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nassumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nproblem:\nProve that... divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems contradictory. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should just be that n is an integer. But in the formatted example, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which is not part of the original problem. That seems like a mistake. Maybe the example was a bad one, but perhaps the user intended to show that sometimes assumptions are split into separate lines even if they are part of the problem's given conditions. Maybe in the example, the problem was actually different. Wait, perhaps the original problem in the example was not correctly transcribed. Hmm. Well, regardless, I need to follow the user's instruction.\n\nNow, the current problem to format is:\n\nTitle: Proving that $\\sum_{i=0}^{n}\\binom{n}{i}i^{n-i}(n-i)^{i}\\le\\frac{1}{2}n^n$\n\nQuestion: How can we prove that\n$$\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=0}^{n}\\binom{n}{i}i^{n-i}(n-i)^{i}\\le\\dfrac{1}{2}n^n$$\nwhere $\\displaystyle\\binom{n}{i}=\\dfrac{n!}{i!(n-i)!}$. This inequality is very interesting. I think this problem has nice methods, but my method is very ugly.\n\nSo, first, identify the assumptions. The problem states the inequality involving the sum from i=0 to n of binomial coefficients multiplied by i^{n-i} and (n-i)^i, and wants to prove it's less than or equal to (1/2) n^n.\n\nWhat are the assumptions here? The problem mentions binomial coefficients, so the variables are n and i. The summation is over i from 0 to n. The problem is about proving an inequality. So the key assumptions would be:\n\n- n is a non-negative integer (since binomial coefficients are defined for non-negative integers n and i, with 0 ≤ i ≤ n).\n\nBut the problem doesn't explicitly state any restrictions on n, but since it's a sum from i=0 to n and uses binomial coefficients, it's implicit that n is a non-negative integer. So that's an assumption. Are there any other assumptions? The problem doesn't mention any other conditions, like n being positive, but binomial coefficients make sense for n ≥ 0. However, if n=0, the sum would have only i=0 term: C(0,0)*0^{0}*(0)^0. Wait, 0^0 is undefined, but sometimes in combinatorics, it's taken as 1. So maybe n is a positive integer? But the problem doesn't specify. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond n being a non-negative integer, but since the problem is about proving the inequality, perhaps we need to state the domain of n. So the main assumption is that n is a non-negative integer. But does the problem specify that? The original question says \"for every integer n\", but no, the title and question don't specify. Wait, the summation is from i=0 to n, so n has to be a non-negative integer. Therefore, the assumption is that n is a non-negative integer.\n\nBut the user's example had \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. In this case, since binomial coefficients are involved, n has to be a non-negative integer. So perhaps the assumption here is that n is a non-negative integer.\n\nBut the user's example included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", but in reality, the original problem in the example didn't have the divisibility by 7. So maybe the user's example was incorrect, but regardless, we need to follow their instruction.\n\nSo for the current problem, the only assumption is that n is a non-negative integer, because the binomial coefficient is defined for n and i as non-negative integers with i ≤ n. Therefore, the assumption should be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a non-negative integer.\n\nBut wait, maybe the problem allows n to be any integer, but in reality, binomial coefficients with negative n or non-integer n are not considered here. Since the problem is about a sum from i=0 to n, n must be a non-negative integer. Therefore, that's the only assumption.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a non-negative integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that\n$$\\sum_{i=0}^{n}\\binom{n}{i}i^{n-i}(n-i)^{i}\\le\\frac{1}{2}n^n$$\nwhere $\\binom{n}{i} = \\frac{n!}{i!(n-i)!}$.\n\nWait, but in the example, the problem included \"where...\" as part of the problem statement. So yes, that's part of the problem, not the assumption. Therefore, the assumptions are only about the conditions on the variables. So the assumption here is that n is a non-negative integer, and the problem is to prove the inequality with the binomial coefficient defined as given.",
