    "Content": "I want to show that the ring of integers of the cubic number field $K = \\mathbb Q(\\alpha)$ , where $\\alpha$ is a root of $f = X^3 - X - 2$ , is equal to $\\mathbb Z[\\alpha]$ . $(1, \\alpha, \\alpha^2)$ forms a $\\mathbb Q$ -basis of $K$ consisting of integers. I know $\\mathbb Z[\\alpha] \\subseteq \\mathcal O_K$ . To show equality, I'm guessing the following result is useful: Let $K$ be a number field of degree $n$ , $(\\alpha_1, \\dots, \\alpha_n)$ a $\\mathbb Q$ -basis of $K$ consisting of integers. Suppose there exist $m \\in \\mathbb N, m > 2$ and $k_1, \\dots, k_n \\in \\mathbb Z$ with $\\gcd(m, k_1, \\dots, k_n) = 1$ such that $$\\frac{k_1 \\alpha_1 + \\dots + k_n \\alpha_n}{m} \\in \\mathcal O_K$$ then $m^2 \\,\\big\\vert\\, \\mathrm{disc}(\\alpha_1, \\dots, \\alpha_n)$ . I have $\\mathrm{disc}(\\alpha_1, \\dots, \\alpha_n) = -104$ , so $m = 2$ , hence I want to show that I cannot have $$\\frac{a + b \\alpha + c \\alpha^2}{2} \\in \\mathcal O_K$$ for integers $a, b, c \\in \\mathbb Z$ of which at least one is odd. But I'm getting stuck here. How do I show these aren't integral elements? Can anyone give me a hint on how to proceed?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Suppose $w \\in \\Bbb Z[\\alpha]$ is not a multiple of $2$ and $w/2$ is an algebraic integer. Consider the ideal $I = (2,w)$.\nWe have $I^2 = (4,2w,w^2)$ and $I^3 = (8,4w,2w^2,w^3)$. However, $w/2$ being an algebraic integer of degree $\\le 3$, we get that $w^3$ is a combination of $8,4w,2w^2$ with integer coefficients, and so $I^3 = (8,4w,2w^2) = 2I^2$, and so on, which shows that unique factorisation of ideals fails : $(2)I^2 = I.I^2$, but $(2) \\neq I$, so $I^2$ is not \"cancellable\", and neither is $I$. To show that an ideal $I$ is cancellable it is enough to show it is a factor of cancellable ideal, for example any principal ideal, say, $(2)$ : If $(2)= IJ$ and $AI = BI$ then $AIJ = BIJ$, so $2A = 2B$ and thus $A=B$. Let $I$ be any ideal containing $(2)$. Since $\\Bbb F_2[X]$ is a PID, $\\Bbb Z[\\alpha]/I$ has to be isomorphic (via the evaluation map) to $\\Bbb F_2[X]/Q(X)$ where $Q(X)$ is a divisor of $X^3+X$ (the reduction modulo $2$ of $X^3-X-2$), and then $I = I_Q = (2,Q(\\alpha))$. The connection between the divisor lattice of $X^3-X-2$ mod $2$ and the ideals containing $(2)$ goes further : If $2 \\in I_Q I_R$, then $I_QI_R = (2,4,2Q(\\alpha),2R(\\alpha),Q(\\alpha)R(\\alpha)) = (2,Q(\\alpha)R(\\alpha)) = I_{QR}$. In particular, if $Q$ and $R$ are coprime, then $1$ is a linear combination of $Q,R$ and $2$, and so $2 \\in I_Q I_R$. So if we show that $(2)$ factors properly as $I_{X}I_{X+1}^2$ then we are done, because this would show that $I_X$ and $I_{X+1}$ are cancellable and their products give all the ideals containing $(2)$. The only way this can possibly go wrong is if $2 \\notin I_{X+1}^2$, so let us do the computation : $I_{X+1}^2 = (2,\\alpha+1)^2 = (4,2\\alpha+2,\\alpha^2+2\\alpha+1)$. It contains $\\alpha.(\\alpha^2+2\\alpha+1) = \\alpha^3+2\\alpha^2+\\alpha = 2\\alpha^2+2\\alpha+2$, so it also contains $2(\\alpha^2+2\\alpha+1)-(2\\alpha^2+2\\alpha+2) = 2\\alpha$, and then $(2\\alpha+2) - 2\\alpha = 2$. Hence $I_{X+1}^2 = (2,\\alpha^2+1) = I_{(X+1)^2}$, which is all we needed.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a math professor who is bilingual and knowledgeable. The task is to take the original question from Math Stack Exchange, filter out the unnecessary information, and present it in the specified format with assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nFirst, I need to read through the original question carefully. The user wants to show that the ring of integers of the cubic number field K = Q(α), where α is a root of f = X³ - X - 2, is equal to Z[α]. They mention that (1, α, α²) forms a Q-basis of K consisting of integers, and they already know that Z[α] is a subset of the ring of integers O_K. \n\nThe user refers to a result that involves an element (k₁α₁ + ... + kₙαₙ)/m being in O_K, with certain conditions on m and the k's. They calculated the discriminant of the basis (1, α, α²) as -104 and concluded that m must be 2. Therefore, they need to show that there are no integers a, b, c (with at least one odd) such that (a + bα + cα²)/2 is in O_K. They are stuck here and need a hint.\n\nNow, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem mentions several conditions:\n\n1. K is a cubic number field, specifically Q(α) where α is a root of X³ - X - 2.\n2. The basis (1, α, α²) is a Q-basis of K consisting of integers. This implies that Z[α] is contained in O_K.\n3. The discriminant of the basis (1, α, α²) is -104.\n4. The result to be used requires that if such an element (a + bα + cα²)/2 is in O_K, then m² divides the discriminant. Here, m=2, so 4 must divide -104. But since 104 divided by 4 is 26, which is an integer, this condition is satisfied. Wait, the user might be using the contrapositive: if such an element exists with m=2 and gcd(m, k₁, k₂, k₃)=1, then m² divides the discriminant. However, since m²=4 divides 104 (since 104 = 4*26), but the gcd condition is that gcd(2, a, b, c)=1. The user wants to show that such elements can't exist, so maybe the discriminant doesn't allow m² to divide it? Wait, but 4 does divide 104. Hmm, maybe I need to check the exact statement of the theorem they are using.\n\nWait, the theorem states that if such an element (sum k_i α_i)/m is in O_K with gcd(m, k₁,...,kₙ)=1, then m² divides the discriminant. Here, the discriminant is -104. So if m=2, then 2²=4 must divide 104. Since 104/4=26, yes, 4 divides 104, so the theorem allows for the possibility. Therefore, the user wants to show that even though m² divides the discriminant, such elements can't exist. Therefore, they need to check whether (a + bα + cα²)/2 is integral, i.e., its minimal polynomial has integer coefficients.\n\nSo the problem reduces to showing that there are no a, b, c in Z with at least one odd such that (a + bα + cα²)/2 is integral. The user is stuck here and needs a hint.\n\nNow, structuring this into the required format: the assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n- K is a cubic number field equal to Q(α), where α is a root of f(X) = X³ - X - 2.\n- The set {1, α, α²} is a Q-basis of K consisting of algebraic integers.\n- The ring Z[α] is contained in the ring of integers O_K of K.\n- The discriminant of the basis (1, α, α²) is -104.\n- Any element (a + bα + cα²)/2 in O_K must satisfy that a, b, c are integers with at least one odd.\n\nWait, the original problem states that they need to show that such elements (with a, b, c having gcd 1 with m=2) do not exist. The problem is to show that O_K = Z[α], which requires showing that there are no additional integral elements beyond Z[α]. The key assumption here is the discriminant of the basis being -104, which allows m=2 as a possible denominator. But since 4 divides 104, the theorem doesn't prevent the existence of such elements, so the user must directly show that such elements (a + bα + cα²)/2 can't be integral.\n\nTherefore, the problem is to show that there do not exist integers a, b, c with at least one odd such that (a + bα + cα²)/2 is an algebraic integer. The user is asking for a hint on how to proceed with this.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- K = Q(α) where α is a root of X³ - X - 2,\n- {1, α, α²} is a Z-basis of Z[α],\n- Z[α] is a subset of O_K,\n- The discriminant of (1, α, α²) is -104,\n- For any element (a + bα + cα²)/2 in O_K, a, b, c are integers with gcd(2, a, b, c) = 1 (i.e., at least one of a, b, c is odd).\n\nProblem: Show that there do not exist integers a, b, c with at least one odd such that (a + bα + cα²)/2 is in O_K, thereby proving O_K = Z[α].\n\nBut in the example given, each assumption is a single line addressing one property. Let me check the example again:\n\nIn the example, the original problem had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Then the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nSo here, we need to list each assumption line by line. Let's parse the problem again.\n\nOriginal problem assumptions:\n\n1. K is a cubic number field, specifically Q(α) with α a root of X³ - X - 2.\n2. The set {1, α, α²} is a Q-basis of K consisting of algebraic integers (since they form a basis of integers).\n3. The discriminant of the basis {1, α, α²} is -104.\n4. The user wants to use the theorem that if an element (k₁α₁ + ... +kₙαₙ)/m is in O_K with gcd(m, k₁,...,kₙ)=1, then m² divides the discriminant. Here, m=2, so m²=4 divides 104, which is true.\n5. The user's goal is to show that such elements (a + bα + cα²)/2 with at least one of a, b, c odd do not exist in O_K.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- K = Q(α), where α is a root of the polynomial X³ - X - 2.\n- The set {1, α, α²} is a Q-basis of K consisting of algebraic integers.\n- The discriminant of the basis {1, α, α²} is -104.\n- For integers a, b, c, if (a + bα + cα²)/2 is in O_K, then gcd(2, a, b, c) = 1 (i.e., at least one of a, b, c is odd).\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user is trying to show that such elements do not exist. So the problem is to show that no such integers a, b, c (with at least one odd) make the element (a + bα + cα²)/2 integral.\n\nHence, the structured problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- K is the cubic number field Q(α) with α a root of X³ - X - 2,\n- {1, α, α²} is a Q-basis of K consisting of algebraic integers,\n- The discriminant of the basis {1, α, α²} is -104,\n- Any element (a + bα + cα²)/2 in O_K must have a, b, c ∈ Z with at least one odd.\n\nProblem:\nShow that there do not exist integers a, b, c with at least one odd such that (a + bα + cα²)/2 is an algebraic integer, thereby proving O_K = Z[α].\n\nBut wait, the problem in the example just states the problem without the \"thereby\" part. Maybe the problem should be to show that O_K equals Z[α]. Let me check the original question.\n\nOriginal problem title: Ring of integers of cubic number field\n\nThe user wants to show that the ring of integers of K is equal to Z[α]. The steps they've taken lead them to needing to show that certain elements can't exist. So the main problem is to show O_K = Z[α], and the specific step is to show that no such (a + bα + cα²)/2 is in O_K.\n\nBut according to the formatting example, the problem should be the main problem. In the example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, even though the user had an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Here, the main problem is to show O_K = Z[α], and the specific step is part of that.\n\nBut the user's question is more about how to show that those elements aren't integral. However, the original problem is to show O_K = Z[α]. The user is stuck on a specific step towards that goal.\n\nSo perhaps the problem should be the main one: Show that the ring of integers of K is Z[α], given the assumptions. But according to the user's question, they have already reduced it to needing to show that those elements can't exist. So maybe the problem as per their current step is to show that (a + bα + cα²)/2 is not in O_K for a, b, c with at least one odd.\n\nAlternatively, since the original problem is to show O_K = Z[α], and the user is asking for a hint on that specific part, perhaps the problem statement should be the main problem, and the assumptions include the necessary conditions leading up to it.\n\nThe example had assumptions like n is integer, n divisible by 7, and the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. Here, the assumptions are:\n\n- K is Q(α) with α³ - α - 2 =0,\n- {1, α, α²} is a basis of integers,\n- Discriminant is -104,\n- The theorem's application leads to m=2,\n- Need to show no such element exists with m=2 and a, b, c not all even.\n\nTherefore, the problem is to show that O_K = Z[α], which relies on showing that there are no elements of the form (a + bα + cα²)/2 in O_K with a, b, c integers having at least one odd.\n\nSo structuring this:\n\nAssumption:\n- K = Q(α) where α is a root of X³ - X - 2,\n- {1, α, α²} is a Q-basis of K consisting of algebraic integers,\n- The discriminant of {1, α, α²} is -104,\n- Z[α] is a subset of O_K,\n- For integers a, b, c, if (a + bα + cα²)/2 ∈ O_K, then at least one of a, b, c is odd.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the ring of integers O_K of K is equal to Z[α].\n\nBut the user's specific problem within this is to show the non-existence of those elements. However, the example given in the instruction includes the main problem. So perhaps the problem statement should be the main one, and the assumptions include the necessary conditions. Alternatively, maybe the problem is the specific step they're stuck on.\n\nThe user writes: \"How do I show these aren't integral elements?\" So their immediate problem is to show that (a + bα + cα²)/2 is not in O_K when at least one of a, b, c is odd. Proving this would complete the proof that O_K = Z[α].\n\nThus, perhaps the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n- K = Q(α) where α³ - α - 2 = 0,\n- {1, α, α²} is a Q-basis of K consisting of algebraic integers,\n- The discriminant of {1, α, α²} is -104,\n- Any element (a + bα + cα²)/2 in O_K must have a, b, c ∈ Z with at least one odd.\n\nProblem:\nShow that there do not exist integers a, b, c with at least one odd such that (a + bα + cα²)/2 is an algebraic integer.\n\nAlternatively, if following the example where the main problem is stated, then:\n\nAssumption:\n- K = Q(α) where α is a root of X³ - X - 2,\n- {1, α, α²} is a Q-basis of K consisting of algebraic integers,\n- The discriminant of the basis {1, α, α²} is -104.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the ring of integers O_K of K is equal to Z[α].\n\nBut the user has already accepted that they need to show that (a + bα + cα²)/2 isn't integral. So maybe the problem should be the specific step they're stuck on. But the example structured the main problem, not the step. So to follow the example, the problem should be the main one.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the assumptions included n being an integer divisible by 7. Here, the main problem is to show O_K = Z[α], and the assumptions are the given conditions.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- K is the cubic number field Q(α), where α is a root of X³ - X - 2,\n- The set {1, α, α²} is a Q-basis of K consisting of algebraic integers,\n- The discriminant of the basis {1, α, α²} is -104,\n- Z[α] is a subset of O_K.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the ring of integers O_K of K is equal to Z[α].\n\nBut the user also mentions the theorem about m² dividing the discriminant, so perhaps that should be an assumption? Wait, the theorem is a result they're using, not an assumption of the problem. The assumptions should be the given conditions in the problem, not the theorems used to solve it.\n\nSo the assumptions are what's given in the problem statement:\n\n- K = Q(α) with α³ - α - 2 =0,\n- {1, α, α²} is a Q-basis of algebraic integers,\n- Discriminant is -104,\n- Z[α] ⊆ O_K.\n\nThe problem is to prove O_K = Z[α].\n\nBut in the example, the assumption included that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the original problem's setup. Here, the original problem states that they want to show equality, given that Z[α] is contained in O_K, and they have a basis with discriminant -104.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- K is the cubic number field Q(α), where α is a root of X³ - X - 2,\n- The set {1, α, α²} forms a Q-basis of K consisting of algebraic integers,\n- The discriminant of the basis {1, α, α²} is -104,\n- Z[α] is contained in the ring of integers O_K of K.\n\nProblem:\nProve that O_K = Z[α].\n\nAlternatively, since the user is focusing on the specific step of excluding elements of the form (a + bα + cα²)/2 with a, b, c having at least one odd, perhaps the problem is to show that such elements are not in O_K, which is part of proving O_K = Z[α].\n\nBut the example took the main problem as the problem statement. The user's question is about how to show that those elements aren't integral, but the overall problem is to prove O_K = Z[α]. Therefore, following the example's structure, the problem should be the main one, and the assumptions include the given conditions leading up to it.\n\nHence, the correct formatting is:\n\nAssumption:\n- K is the cubic number field Q(α), where α is a root of X³ - X - 2,\n- {1, α, α²} is a Q-basis of K consisting of algebraic integers,\n- The discriminant of {1, α, α²} is -104,\n- Z[α] is a subset of O_K.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the ring of integers O_K of K is equal to Z[α].\n\nThis way, the assumptions list all given conditions, and the problem is the main goal. The specific step the user is stuck on is part of the solution, not the problem statement. However, the user's question specifically asks about showing those elements aren't integral. But since the example structured the main problem, even if the user is at a step, I think we should follow that.\n\nAlternatively, if the user's current step is considered the problem to be formatted, then:\n\nAssumption:\n- K is the cubic number field Q(α), where α is a root of X³ - X - 2,\n- {1, α, α²} is a Q-basis of K consisting of algebraic integers,\n- The discriminant of {1, α, α²} is -104,\n- For integers a, b, c, if (a + bα + cα²)/2 is in O_K, then at least one of a, b, c is odd.\n\nProblem:\nShow that there do not exist integers a, b, c with at least one odd such that (a + bα + cα²)/2 is an algebraic integer.\n\nBut I think the original problem is to prove O_K = Z[α], so according to the instructions, we should structure the main problem, not the intermediate step. The example's formatted problem was the main question, not a step within it.
