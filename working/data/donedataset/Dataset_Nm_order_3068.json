    "Content": "On the sides $CA$ and $CB$ of an isosceles right-angled triangle $ABC$ , points $D$ and $E$ are chosen such that $|CD|=|CE|$ . The perpendiculars from $D$ and $C$ on $AE$ intersect the hypotenuse $AB$ in $K$ and $L$ respectively. Prove that $|KL|=|LB|$ . Proposed by Victors Linis, University of Ottawa. Crux Mathematicorum Vol. 1, No. 4, June, 1975 I want a solution via vectors and I'll explain why in the end of the question, tl;dr. The question consists of: the basic things we can do with vectors, how did I come to a regular geometric solution, regular geometric solution, motivation for vectors approach. To give more explicit context, I'll explain the basic things we can do with vectors to approach real geometry problems. We can add or subtract vectors, e.g. $\\overrightarrow{AB}+\\overrightarrow{BC}=\\overrightarrow{AC}$ . We can scale a vector by a coefficient (say $k$ ) so if $A,B,C$ lie on the same line and $k=\\frac{AC}{AB}$ then $\\overrightarrow{AC}=k\\overrightarrow{AB}$ . In particular, 1. and 2. follows that if $X$ is on $AB$ , such that $\\frac{AX}{XB}=\\frac{t}{1-t}$ then $\\overrightarrow{OX}$ $=\\overrightarrow{OA}+\\overrightarrow{AX}$ $=\n\\overrightarrow{OA}+t\\,\\overrightarrow{AB}$ $=\n\\overrightarrow{OA}+t(\\overrightarrow{OB}-\\overrightarrow{OA})$$=\nt\\,\\overrightarrow{OB}+(1-t)\\,\\overrightarrow{OA}$ . If some vectors form a basis, then every vector has unique representation as a linear combination of basis vectors with coefficients called \"coordinates\" (e.g. $\\overrightarrow{i},\\,\\overrightarrow{j},\\,\\overrightarrow{k}$ is a classical basis for 3d Cartesian coordinates). Knowing only 1.-4. some problems like this (not in a way attention drawing) may be solved when a convinient basis is chosen, and even Ceva's_theorem , Menelaus's theorem , Thales' theorem can be proven, almost in an algebraic way. I'd call such \"linear vector problems\". But we know also Scalar (dot) product. By definition $\\cos\\angle BAC=\\frac{\\overrightarrow{BA}\\cdot\\overrightarrow{BC}}{\n|\\overrightarrow{BA}|\\cdot|\\overrightarrow{BC}|}$ , or, alternatively, $(\\overrightarrow{BA}\\cdot\\overrightarrow{BC})=BA\\cdot BC\\cdot \\cos\\angle BAC$ . This implies such things like $(\\overrightarrow{BA}\\cdot \\overrightarrow{BA})=(\\overrightarrow{BA})^2=|\\overrightarrow{BA}|^2=BA^2$ and $(\\overrightarrow{BA}\\cdot\\overrightarrow{BC})=0\\Leftrightarrow BA\\perp BC$ unless $BA$ or $BC$ equals to zero. All distributive laws holds for addition/subtraction related to scalar or/and dot product. With 1.-5. such things like cosine rule , Heron's formula , Ptolemy's_theorem can be proven and I believe the problem above can be solved too.) We also know (though it's usage mostly limited by 3d Cartesian space) Cross product Having these tools, we can approach problems, where all conditions given and things to be proven/found are: parallelity, perpendicularity, fixed angles, intersection, intersection at a ratio (and maybe some others). But apparently we can't deal with circles, addition/subtraction of angles and many other things. But boiling a geometric problem down to algebra can be useful when no other ways seen. Other approaches are complex numbers or Cartesian coordinates, but vectors are unfairly less popular/known. I'd say, many vectors excercises are constructed just to train using vectors, instead of showing how real geometrical problems may be solved in an algebraic way. Arriving at regular geometrical solution I made the figure above in geogebra and started moving free point $D$ back and forth and see how the things change and I noted that somewhat asymmethrical that we have $3$ points on $AB$ and only two on $AE$ , I wanted inverse-image of $B$ to be present to. To construct it, I mirrored $B$ relative to $AE$ into $B'$ . By moving $D$ I noted that $BB'||CL||DK$ (and indeed, they all are perpendicular to $AE$ ) and that reminded me of Thales' theorem -- if we have say $F=BB'\\cap AC$ then it would suffice to show that $DC=CF$ and use Thales' theorem. By \"method of gazely staring\" I found that $\\triangle CFB\\sim \\triangle HEC$ , but it's obvious that $\\triangle HEC\\sim\\triangle CEA$ , but $CA=CB$ and thus $CE=CF$ , but it's given that $CD=CE$ , which completes the proof. Geometrical solution, refined We take $F$ on the line $AC$ such that $BF||CL$ . $\\angle FBC=\\angle ECH$ , where $H=CL\\cap EA$ . From right-angled $\\triangle ECH$ : $\\angle ECH=90^\\circ -\\angle CEH$ , but from right-angled $\\triangle ECA$ : $\\angle CAE=90^\\circ -\\angle CEH$ thus $\\angle FBC=\\angle ECH=\\angle EAC$ hence $\\triangle FBC$ and $\\triangle EAC$ are congruent by ASA that follows $CF=CE$ , but it's given that $CD=CE$ thus $CF=CD$ and using Thales' theorem on lines $AB$ , $AC$ intersected by $BF \\parallel CL \\parallel DK$ we obtain $BL=LK$ , QED. But imagine I were at a contest without being able to use geogebra and move the point $D$ and to want to construct $BB'$ , then arriving at this solution with such additional constructions is highly doubtful. While vectors approach is pretty straightforward: algebraically express what's given and what's needed, solve algebraical problem, usually a linear equations system. That's why I want vectors solution. Other algebraical solutions, like Cartesian coordinates, complex coordinates or even something like barycentric coordinates are welcome as well. Thanks for reading this through out.)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Put the origin of a Cartesian coordinate system to $C$ , direct axis along the sides $CA$ and $CB$ such that coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ are $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$ , respectively. Then there exists $0\\le a\\le 1$ such that coordinates of points $D$ and $E$ are $(a,0)$ and $(0,a)$ (according to the picture, I assumed that the point $D$ belongs to $CA$ and the point $E$ belongs to $CB$ ). Also $K=(k,1-k)$ and $L=(\\ell,1-\\ell)$ for some $k,\\ell$ . Since $(\\ell,1-\\ell)=CL \\perp EA=(1,-a)$ , we have the inner product $(CL,EA)= \\ell-(1-\\ell)a=0$ , so $\\ell=\\tfrac a{a+1}$ and $|LB|=\\sqrt{2}\\ell=\\sqrt{2}\\tfrac a{a+1}$ . Since $(k-a,1-k)=DK \\perp EA$ , we have $(DK,EA)=(k-a)-(1-k)a=0$ , so $k=\\tfrac {2a}{a+1}$ and $|KL|=\\sqrt{2}(k-\\ell)=\\sqrt{2}\\tfrac a{a+1}=|LB|$ . PS. approach is pretty straightforward: algebraically express what's given and what's needed, solve algebraic problem. This is an idea of the Cartesian program to solve problems. As some other his clear ideas, it turned out to be too naїve. See its development in a book \"Mathematical discovery: on understanding, learning and teaching\" by George Polya (in Russian translation \"Математическое открытие\" Джорджа Пойа), which is helpful for contest problem solvers. Differences between analytical and geometrical approaches to geometrical problems were considered by an adept of the first approach, V. Tikhomirov in a paper “ Geometry or analysis ” (in Russian) from the good old “Kvant”,  which I read when I was a schoolboy. I was good in school algebra and weak in school geometry so at contests I first quickly solved algebraic problems and postponed geometrical those to end. Then I had some time left for a one or two problems and usually used an analytical approach to solve them. At a contest, when a quick solution is needed and a search for geometrical tricks like an additional construction can be fruitless,  this was a good strategy for me.  Nevertheless, sometimes an analytical way can lead to cumbersome calculations and be too long, whereas an easy trick can shorten a solution a lot. Once I had a problem to calculate some angle, which I finally did, canceling cumbersome fractions. Later I got to know that the other contestants simply drew a picture, measured that angle and proved that it is equal to fifteen degrees. So I lost a lot of time due to my straightforward approach. This could cost me a few points, which was crucial for me, because this contest was an IMO selection and I turned out a few points below my main competitor from my city, and he was qualified to be in the team, whereas I was not (luckily for me, he obtained no awards at that IMO, so the head of our school thought that if I would participated instead of my competitor then I could win an award, but this is an other story). Another example of a long analytical way to an answer is my solution of this bounty geometry problem, which was even not upvoted although it was the first. Sometimes an analytical way can be too complicated and lead to a blind alley, for instance, when I studied an inequality from celestial mechanics, see these comments.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to break down this problem step by step. So, the problem is about an isosceles right-angled triangle ABC with the right angle at C. That means AC and BC are equal in length, and angles at A and B are both 45 degrees. Points D and E are on CA and CB respectively, such that CD equals CE. Then, we need to consider the perpendiculars from D and C onto AE, which intersect the hypotenuse AB at K and L. The goal is to prove that KL is equal in length to LB.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the triangle. Since it's isosceles and right-angled at C, I can place point C at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then, point A could be at (a,0) and point B at (0,a) where a is the length of the legs AC and BC. Points D and E are on CA and CB such that CD = CE. So, if CD is some length, say, k, then D would be at (k, 0) on CA, and E would be at (0, k) on CB. Since CA and CB are both length a, then k must be between 0 and a.\n\nNext, AE is the line from A (a,0) to E (0,k). The equation of AE can be found, and then we need the perpendiculars from D and C onto AE. The perpendicular from D to AE will intersect AB at K, and the perpendicular from C to AE will intersect AB at L. Then, we have to show that the segment KL is equal to LB.\n\nSince the problem suggests using vectors, let me recall vector approaches. Choosing a coordinate system where C is at the origin might be helpful. Let me assign coordinates: Let’s set C as (0,0), A as (1,0), B as (0,1) for simplicity since the triangle is isosceles, so AC = BC = 1 unit. Then, points D and E would be at (d,0) and (0,d) where d is between 0 and 1 because CD = CE = d.\n\nNow, the line AE connects A(1,0) and E(0,d). The vector equation of AE can be parameterized as (1 - t, d t) where t ranges from 0 to 1. The direction vector of AE is (-1, d). The perpendicular to AE would have a direction vector (d, 1) because the dot product of (-1, d) and (d, 1) is -d + d = 0, confirming perpendicularity.\n\nThe perpendicular from D to AE: Point D is (d,0). The line perpendicular to AE through D has direction vector (d,1). So, parametric equations for this line would be (d + d*s, 0 + 1*s) where s is a parameter. We need to find where this line intersects AB.\n\nThe hypotenuse AB goes from A(1,0) to B(0,1), so its equation is x + y = 1. To find the intersection point K, we substitute the parametric equations of the perpendicular line into AB's equation. So, x = d + d*s, y = s. Then, substituting into x + y = 1: d + d*s + s = 1. Solving for s: s(d + 1) = 1 - d ⇒ s = (1 - d)/(1 + d). Therefore, the coordinates of K are (d + d*(1 - d)/(1 + d), (1 - d)/(1 + d)).\n\nSimplifying K's x-coordinate: d*(1 + (1 - d)/(1 + d)) = d*[(1 + d + 1 - d)/(1 + d)] = d*(2)/(1 + d) = 2d/(1 + d). So, K is (2d/(1 + d), (1 - d)/(1 + d)).\n\nNext, the perpendicular from C to AE. Point C is (0,0). The line perpendicular to AE through C has the same direction vector (d,1). So, parametric equations are (0 + d*s, 0 + 1*s) = (d*s, s). This line intersects AB at L. Substituting into x + y = 1: d*s + s = s(d + 1) = 1 ⇒ s = 1/(d + 1). Therefore, L is (d/(d + 1), 1/(d + 1)).\n\nNow, we need to find KL and LB. Let's compute their coordinates first.\n\nPoint K: (2d/(1 + d), (1 - d)/(1 + d))\n\nPoint L: (d/(1 + d), 1/(1 + d))\n\nPoint B: (0,1)\n\nFirst, compute KL's coordinates. The distance between K and L:\n\nΔx = (2d/(1 + d) - d/(1 + d)) = (d/(1 + d))\n\nΔy = ((1 - d)/(1 + d) - 1/(1 + d)) = (-d/(1 + d))\n\nSo, KL length is sqrt[(d/(1 + d))² + (-d/(1 + d))²] = sqrt[2d²/(1 + d)²] = (d√2)/(1 + d)\n\nNow, compute LB's length. Point L is (d/(1 + d), 1/(1 + d)), and B is (0,1).\n\nΔx = -d/(1 + d)\n\nΔy = 1 - 1/(1 + d) = ( (1 + d) - 1 )/(1 + d) = d/(1 + d)\n\nLB length is sqrt[(-d/(1 + d))² + (d/(1 + d))²] = sqrt[2d²/(1 + d)²] = (d√2)/(1 + d)\n\nSo, both KL and LB have the same length, (d√2)/(1 + d), hence KL = LB. Therefore, the proof is complete using vector coordinates.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, they mention that ABC is an isosceles right-angled triangle. In my setup, I assumed AC = BC = 1, which aligns with the isosceles right-angled condition. Also, CD = CE = d, so points D and E are placed symmetrically on CA and CB. The use of coordinates and vectors seems valid here.\n\nHowever, let me check if there's any assumption I might have missed. The problem says \"the perpendiculars from D and C on AE intersect the hypotenuse AB in K and L respectively\". So, the perpendiculars are indeed from D and C onto AE, which we have considered. The key was parameterizing these perpendiculars and finding their intersection points with AB. Then, computing the distances KL and LB shows they are equal. The calculation worked out because both distances simplified to the same expression. Therefore, the vector approach successfully demonstrates that |KL| = |LB|.",
