    "Content": "Rank theorem on manifolds says that : Suppose $M$ and $N$ are two smooth manifolds of dimensions $m$ and $n$ , respectively, and $F:M\\rightarrow N$ be a smooth map with constant rank $r$ . For each $p\\in M$ there exists a smooth chart $(U,\\varphi)$ around $p$ and a smooth chart $(V,\\psi)$ around $F(p)$ such that $F(U)\\subseteq V$ and $$\\psi\\circ F\\circ \\varphi^{-1}:\\varphi^{-1}\n(U)\\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^m\\rightarrow\\psi(V)\\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^n$$ is given by $(a_1,\\cdots,a_m)=(a_1,\\cdots,a_r,0,\\cdots,0)$ . There are many books where proof of this has been discussed but none of the books I have seen has proof that I feel excited. So, I am trying to produce another proof which I think is most natural. Let $p\\in M$ . As $F$ is a map of constant rank, $dF_p:T_pM\\rightarrow T_{F(p)}(N)$ is of rank $r$ . A Linear algebra results says that, in this case, there exists basis for $T_pM$ and a basis for $T_{F(p)}(N)$ such that $dF_p:T_pM\\rightarrow T_{F(p)}N$ is represented by matrix $\\begin{bmatrix}I_r&0\\\\0&0\\end{bmatrix}$ i.e., it is given by $$(v_1,\\cdots,v_r,v_{r+1},\\cdots,v_m)\\rightarrow (v_1,\\cdots,v_r,0,\\cdots,0).$$ I am almost sure that the basis of $T_pM$ and the basis of $T_{F(p)}N$ that we choose above corresponds to charts around $p$ and $F(p)$ respectively. I will try to elaborate what I said. How do we think of a basis of tangent space at a point? Given $p\\in M$ , we take any chart $(U,\\varphi)$ around that point given by $\\varphi=(x_1,\\cdots,x_n)$ and then see that $$\\left\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}\\bigg|_p:1\\leq i\\leq n\\right\\}$$ is a basis for $T_pM$ . Now I am hoping to trace back. Given a basis of $T_pM$ can we trace back to obtain a chart $(U,\\varphi)$ at $p$ . Suppose we could find that charts $(U,\\varphi)$ at $p$ and $(V,\\psi)$ at $F(p)$ such that the corresponding basis at tangent spaces is the choice of basis that we have made above. Let $(U,\\varphi=(x_1,\\cdots,x_m))$ be chart based at $p$ . Then $\\{\\partial/\\partial x_i|_p:1\\leq i\\leq m\\}$ is the basis of $T_pM$ that we have mentioned above and similarly $(V,\\psi=(y_1,\\cdots,y_n))$ be chart based at $F(p)$ and $\\{\\partial/\\partial y_j|_{F(p)}:1\\leq i\\leq n\\}$ is the basis of $T_{F(p)}N$ that we have mentioned above. So, we have $$dF_p(a_1,\\cdots,a_m)=(a_1,\\cdots,a_r,0,\\cdots,0).$$ So, $$dF_p\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^ma_i\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}\\bigg|_p\\right)\n=\\sum_{i=1}^ra_i\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_i}\\bigg|_{F(p)}$$ $$\\sum_{i=1}^ma_idF_p\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}\\bigg|_p\\right)\n=\\sum_{i=1}^ra_i\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_i}\\bigg|_{F(p)}$$ $$\\sum_{i=1}^ma_i\\left(\\sum_{k=1}^n\\frac{\\partial F^k}{\\partial x_i}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k} \\bigg|_{F(p)}\\right)\n=\\sum_{i=1}^ra_i\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_i}\\bigg|_{F(p)}$$ Here I have assumed $F$ to be a map (locally) from $\\mathbb{R}^m\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^n$ and $F^k$ are the corresponding functions of $F$ . I still do not see how to use this and conclude that $\\psi\\circ F\\circ \\varphi^{-1}(a_1,\\cdots,a_m)=(a_1,\\cdots,a_r,0,\\cdots,0).$ Am I going in correct way? Can you suggest something to complete this proof",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The usual argument for the fact that given a rank $r$ matrix $A$ we can find invertible $P,Q$ such that \n$$PAQ = \\begin{pmatrix} I_r & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nis obtained by applying row operations (encoded in $P$) and column operations (encoded in $Q^T$) to $A$ until you get to the desired form. If you have a family $A(t)$ of matrices of rank $A(t)$ which depends smoothly on a parameter $t$, it is not clear that this argument can be applied to get smooth families $P(t),Q(t)$ such that \n$$P(t)A(t)Q(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} I_r & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}. $$ You might think that we can find $P(0),Q(0)$ for $A(0)$ and then take $P(t) \\equiv P(0), Q(t) \\equiv Q(0)$ but by playing with any non-trivial example you will see that this must fail. How is this related to your situation? After choosing local coordinates, you have a family of matrices $dF|_{(x^1,\\dots,x^m)}$ which have constant rank $r$ and depend smoothly on $(x^1,\\dots,x^m)$. You suggest that by solving the problem for a specific value of $x^1,\\dots,x^m$, you have solved the problem for all the other matrices but this is false. From this perspective, the proof of the constant rank theorem tries to bring the matrices $dF|_{(x^1,\\dots,x^m)}$ to a canonical form that works for all values of $x^1,\\dots,x^m$ (in a small enough neighborhood). It is instructive to see how, when $M = \\mathbb{R}^m, N = \\mathbb{R}^n$ and $F$ is linear, the standard proof of the constant rank theorem reconstructs the familiar result from linear algebra. The point is that the way in which it proves the familiar result from linear algebra is actually more suited to study the general case of bringing a family of matrices (instead of a single one) to a canonical form so from this point of view, the proof is a natural generalization of the linear algebra result.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user is trying to prove the rank theorem on manifolds using a specific approach involving the linear algebra result about the differential having a particular matrix representation. They mentioned that given the differential has a matrix with the identity block and zeros, this should correspond to charts where the map simplifies to the canonical form. \n\nFirst, let me recall the rank theorem. It states that if a smooth map between manifolds has constant rank near a point, then there exist charts around that point and its image such that the map is represented as a projection in coordinates. The standard proofs usually involve using the inverse function theorem or the constant rank theorem by constructing appropriate coordinate changes. The user wants an alternative proof using the basis chosen from the linear algebra perspective.\n\nIn their attempt, they start by noting that the differential at a point p, dF_p, has rank r. From linear algebra, we know there are bases for the tangent spaces at p and F(p) such that the matrix of dF_p is the block matrix [I_r 0; 0 0]. The user is trying to connect these bases to actual coordinate charts on the manifolds. \n\nThey mention that given a chart, the tangent vectors are the partial derivatives with respect to the coordinates. Now, they want to reverse-engineer this: given a basis of the tangent space (from the linear algebra result), can we find a chart such that the coordinate vectors correspond to this basis? This seems plausible because, in differential geometry, coordinates induce bases for the tangent space, and under certain conditions (like the inverse function theorem), you can construct coordinates that \"align\" with given tangent vectors.\n\nThe user then writes out the expression for dF_p in terms of these bases and tries to see how this translates to the coordinate representation of F. They end up with equations involving partial derivatives of the components of F and are stuck on how to conclude that the coordinate representation of F is the projection map.\n\nLet me try to see where the difficulty is. If we have dF_p represented as the matrix [I_r 0; 0 0], then in terms of the chosen bases, this means that the first r coordinates are preserved, and the rest are killed. But to get F itself (not just its derivative) to look like the projection, we need to adjust the charts so that F, when composed with these charts, has that simple form. This likely requires using the inverse function theorem or some form of the implicit function theorem to adjust the coordinates so that the higher-order terms vanish.\n\nWait, but the user is trying to do this without invoking the standard proofs. Let's think: if the differential at p is of this form, then perhaps we can use the fact that F is locally linearizable modulo higher-order terms. But how to ensure that those higher-order terms don't mess up the rank? Since the rank is constant, maybe the higher-order terms don't affect the rank in a neighborhood, so we can set up coordinates where they are zero.\n\nAlternatively, consider splitting the coordinates into the first r and the remaining. Since dF_p is surjective on the first r coordinates and zero on the rest, perhaps we can define the charts such that the first r coordinates of the chart around F(p) come from F itself, and the remaining coordinates are extensions to a full chart. Then, using the constant rank, these functions would have linearly independent differentials, allowing the inverse function theorem to apply.\n\nWait, this is starting to resemble the standard proof. The user's approach is trying to use the given bases of the tangent space to construct the charts directly. So, if the basis for T_pM is such that the first r vectors are mapped to the first r basis vectors of T_{F(p)}N, and the rest are mapped to zero, then perhaps the coordinate functions for the chart around p can be chosen such that the first r coordinates correspond to the first r coordinates of the chart around F(p). Then, by the constant rank, the rest of the coordinates can be adjusted to make F look like a projection.\n\nBut maybe the key is to define the charts in such a way that F, in these coordinates, has a derivative matching the matrix, and then use the fact that the higher-order terms can be integrated or adjusted away because the rank remains constant. However, the user's current step involves equating the differential expression to the basis, but they get stuck on how to translate that into the actual map being a projection.\n\nPerhaps they need to consider the Taylor expansion of F in these coordinates. If the derivative is exactly the projection, then F should look like F(a) = (a1, ..., ar, 0, ..., 0) + higher-order terms. But since the rank is constant, those higher-order terms can't contribute to the rank, so they must be in the directions that are already zeroed out. Therefore, maybe by using some form of the implicit function theorem, we can adjust the coordinates to eliminate those higher-order terms.\n\nAlternatively, if we can show that the higher-order terms in the remaining coordinates (after the first r) are functions that can be absorbed into the coordinate chart on N, thereby allowing us to set them to zero. This would require a careful construction of the charts to \"straighten out\" the map.\n\nAnother angle: Since dF_p has rank r, by the constant rank theorem, F is locally equivalent to a linear projection. The constant rank theorem is usually proven using the inverse function theorem, so maybe the user is trying to reconstruct that proof but via the tangent space bases. \n\nThe user's equations show that the partial derivatives of F^k with respect to x_i are such that, at p, they form the identity matrix for k = i (i <= r) and zero otherwise. But to get the actual map to be a projection, we need these derivatives to hold not just at p, but in a neighborhood, which would follow if the coordinates are chosen such that F is linear in those coordinates. But how to ensure that?\n\nPerhaps the idea is to use the exponential map or some diffeomorphism to translate the linear structure at the tangent space to the manifold. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, use the given basis vectors to define coordinates via flows along these vectors, constructing a chart where the coordinates correspond to these basis elements. If we can do that, then F in these coordinates would have the desired derivative, and by the constant rank, higher-order terms would vanish.\n\nWait, maybe using the Frobenius theorem? If the distribution defined by the kernel of dF is integrable, then we can find submanifolds whose tangent spaces are the kernels, and similarly for the image. But the rank is constant, so the kernel and image distributions are of constant dimension, hence integrable. Then, the coordinates can be adapted to these foliations, leading to the canonical form.\n\nBut the user is trying to avoid invoking the standard proofs. Let's recap: the user has set up the bases for the tangent spaces so that dF_p is the projection matrix. They want to get charts such that the coordinate functions correspond to these bases, and then show that F in these coordinates is the projection. The problem arises in going from the linear algebra statement (about the differential) to the actual map F being a projection in coordinates. \n\nThe missing step might be to use the inverse function theorem to adjust the charts so that the nonlinear parts are canceled out. For instance, since dF_p has maximal rank on the first r coordinates, we can apply the inverse function theorem to those components. Let me elaborate:\n\nSuppose we split the coordinates on M into (x_1, ..., x_r, x_{r+1}, ..., x_m) and on N into (y_1, ..., y_r, y_{r+1}, ..., y_n). Then, the differential dF_p is such that the first r components of F (assuming F maps into the first r coordinates) have an invertible differential. By the inverse function theorem, there exists a neighborhood where the map (x_1, ..., x_r) ↦ (F_1, ..., F_r) is a diffeomorphism. Then, we can use the inverse of this map as part of the chart on M, which would make F in these coordinates look like (x_1, ..., x_r, ..., x_m) ↦ (x_1, ..., x_r, 0, ..., 0). The remaining coordinates on N can be adjusted to account for the other components of F, but since the rank is r, those components must depend on the first r variables in a way that can be subtracted off.\n\nAlternatively, consider defining the chart on N so that the first r coordinates are F_1, ..., F_r, and the remaining coordinates are some extension. Then, composing F with the inverse of this chart would project to the first r coordinates. However, this requires that F_1, ..., F_r form part of a coordinate system, which is where the constant rank comes in, ensuring that their differentials are linearly independent.\n\nThis seems like the standard approach to the rank theorem, so perhaps the user's method is aligned with that but needs to make the connection explicit between the chosen bases and the construction of the charts using the inverse function theorem. The key is that once you have the differential in the desired form, you can use the inverse function theorem to \"rectify\" the coordinates so that the map becomes linear, and then the constant rank ensures that the other components can be ignored or adjusted to zero.\n\nIn the user's equations, they have the differential expressed in terms of the basis, but they need to integrate this into the actual map. If they can show that in these coordinates, the higher-order terms vanish or can be factored out, then the result would follow. However, this likely requires invoking the inverse function theorem or a similar result to modify the charts appropriately.\n\nSo, to complete the proof, the user should:\n\n1. Use the chosen bases for the tangent spaces to construct charts around p and F(p), possibly via the inverse function theorem, such that the coordinate functions align with these bases.\n\n2. Show that in these coordinates, the higher-order terms of F vanish due to the constant rank condition, resulting in F being a linear projection.\n\n3. Verify that the composition of the charts with F indeed gives the canonical form as stated in the rank theorem.\n\nThe user's approach is on the right track but needs to connect the linear algebra result with the geometric construction of charts, possibly by applying the inverse function theorem to the appropriate components of F to straighten out the coordinates.",
