    "Content": "This is an exercise from Kunen book - Set theory, an introduction to independence proofs. Let $\\kappa$ be an infinite cardinal and $\\triangleleft$ any well-ordering of $\\kappa$. Show that there is an $X \\subset \\kappa$ such that: $\\vert X \\vert = \\kappa$, $\\triangleleft$ and $<$ agree on $X$. I'm trying to build $X$ by transfinite induction, but I don't succeed to prove that its cardinal can be equal to $\\kappa$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "First let's prove this for $\\kappa$ regular: WLOG, assume the order-type of $\\triangleleft$ is again $\\kappa$ . Now suppose I have a set $A\\subseteq \\kappa$ on which $\\triangleleft$ agrees with $<$ and $\\vert A\\vert<\\kappa$ ; then (since $\\kappa$ is regular) there must be $\\kappa$ -many elements of $\\kappa$ which are $>$ -greater than every element of $A$ ; but then, since $(\\kappa,\\triangleleft)$ has order-type $\\kappa$ , one (in fact, $\\kappa$ -many) must also be $\\triangleleft$ -greater than every element of $A$ , so $A$ can be strictly extended to a longer set on which $<$ and $\\triangleleft$ agree. Now what about the singular case? Let $cf(\\kappa)=\\lambda$ , $\\kappa=\\bigcup_{\\alpha<\\lambda} A_\\alpha$ where if $\\alpha<\\beta$ then each element of $A_\\alpha$ is $<$ -less than each element of $A_\\beta$ , and the $A_\\alpha$ have increasing regular cardinalities $\\mu_\\alpha$ , and again WLOG assume $\\triangleleft$ has order type $\\kappa$ on $\\kappa$ and ordertype $\\mu_\\alpha$ on each $A_\\alpha$ . Define a new ordering $\\prec$ on $\\lambda$ , given by $$\\alpha\\prec\\beta\\iff \\sup_{\\triangleleft}(A_\\alpha)\\triangleleft\\sup_{\\triangleleft}(A_\\beta).$$ Note that because the $\\triangleleft$ -order on $A_\\alpha$ has ordertype $\\mu_\\alpha$ , and the $\\mu_\\alpha$ s are distinct, $\\prec$ is actually a linear order on $\\lambda$ , and moreover is easily seen to be a well-order. So since $\\lambda$ is regular, pick a simultaneously $\\prec$ - and $<$ -increasing sequence $\\{\\theta_\\eta: \\eta<\\lambda\\}$ of elements of $\\mu$ . Since $\\lambda$ is regular, this sequence is $<$ -cofinal in $\\lambda$ . Now by definition of $\\prec$ we may recursively pick, for each $\\eta<\\lambda$ , a $\\triangleleft$ -cofinal subset $C_{\\theta_\\eta}$ of $A_{\\theta_\\eta}$ - on which $\\triangleleft$ and $<$ agree! - such that $\\eta<\\gamma$ implies that every element of $C_{\\theta_\\eta}$ is $\\triangleleft$ -less than every element of $C_{\\theta_\\gamma}$ . Since each $A_{\\theta_\\eta}$ is of regular cardinality, $$C=\\bigcup_{\\eta<\\lambda} C_{\\theta_\\eta}$$ has cardinality $\\kappa$ , and by construction $<$ and $\\triangleleft$ agree on $C$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. Let me first read through the original question carefully.\n\nThe title is \"Well ordering agreeing with ordinal ordering on a cardinal.\" The user mentions it's an exercise from Kunen's book on set theory. The problem states: Let κ be an infinite cardinal, and let ◃ be any well-ordering of κ. We need to show there's a subset X of κ with |X| = κ such that ◃ and < (the usual ordinal ordering) agree on X. The user tried using transfinite induction but couldn't prove X has cardinality κ.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. The assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. Let's parse the problem:\n\n1. κ is an infinite cardinal. That's one assumption.\n2. ◃ is a well-ordering of κ. Another assumption. Since the problem mentions \"any well-ordering,\" that's a condition on ◃.\n3. The problem is to find a subset X of κ such that |X| = κ and ◃ agrees with < on X.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"agree on X,\" meaning that for any two elements in X, their order under ◃ is the same as under the usual ordinal ordering <. So the conditions on X are: it's a subset of κ, has cardinality κ, and the two orderings agree on it.\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n- κ is an infinite cardinal.\n- ◃ is a well-ordering of κ.\n\nThe problem is to show there exists X subset of κ with |X| = κ where ◃ and < agree on X.\n\nWait, does the problem have any other implicit assumptions? For example, κ is an ordinal since it's a cardinal, and cardinals are initial ordinals. So κ is an ordinal with the usual < ordering. The well-ordering ◃ is another well-ordering on the set κ. So we have two well-orderings on κ: the usual ordinal < and the given ◃. We need a subset X where these two orderings agree and X has size κ.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should list that κ is an infinite cardinal, and that ◃ is a well-ordering on κ. The problem is to find such an X.\n\nSo putting it into the format:\n\nAssumption: κ is an infinite cardinal.\nAssumption: ◃ is a well-ordering of κ.\nProblem: Show that there exists X ⊂ κ such that |X| = κ and ◃ agrees with < on X.\n\nI think that's correct. The example given in the user's instruction had assumptions each addressing one property applied to one object. Here, κ is one object with the property of being an infinite cardinal. Then ◃ is another object (a well-ordering) with the property of being a well-ordering of κ. The problem is then to show the existence of X with those properties.\n\nThe user's example had the assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, it's similar: separate assumptions for κ and ◃. The problem is the conclusion to prove.\n\nI don't see any other assumptions in the original problem. The user didn't mention any other conditions, like specific properties of ◃ or κ beyond being an infinite cardinal. So the formatted problem should look like that.",
