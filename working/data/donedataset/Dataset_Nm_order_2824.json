    "Content": "Let $f \\colon GL_{n}(\\mathbb{R})\\to GL_{n}(\\mathbb{R})$ be a function which maps $A\\mapsto A^{-1}$.

    "AcceptedAnswer": "I guess we can show that the map from GL$_n\\mathbb{R} \\to M_n(\\mathbb{R})$ given by $A \\mapsto A^{-1}$ is continuous with respect to the operator norm $||\\cdot ||$. To prove this, fix some $A \\in GL_n(\\mathbb{R})$. Whenever $||B-A||$ is small enough, $||B^{-1}||$ is bounded away from infinity (see below), and then just notice that $$||A^{-1}-B^{-1}||= ||B^{-1}(B-A)A^{-1}|| \\leq ||B^{-1}|| \\cdot ||B-A|| \\cdot ||A^{-1}|| \\leq \\alpha \\cdot ||B-A|| $$ where $\\alpha$ is a constant which depends on the maximum of $||B^{-1}||$ on the prescribed neighborhood of $A$. If you want explicit bounds on $||B^{-1}||$, one can use the formula $B^{-1} = A^{-1} \\sum_0^{\\infty} (A-B)^nA^{-n}$ (which is true when $||B-A||< \\frac{1}{||A^{-1}||}$) in order to show that $||B^{-1}|| \\leq \\frac{||A^{-1}||}{1-||B-A||\\cdot||A^{-1}||}$, so that $||B^{-1}|| \\leq 2||A^{-1}||$ whenever $||B-A|| < \\frac{1}{2||A^{-1}||}$. This proof is overkill. In fact it works in any Banach space, not just finite-dimesional ones.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the original problem. The question is about proving that the function f mapping an invertible matrix A to its inverse A⁻¹ is continuous. The user mentions using the adjugate matrix formula and wonders if there's an overkill method. They also mention that GLₙ(ℝ) is the set of invertible matrices with real coefficients, defined as det⁻¹(ℝ\\{0}).\n\nNow, following the example provided, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. The example shows that assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object. \n\nLooking at the problem: The function f is defined on GLₙ(ℝ), which is the general linear group of invertible n×n real matrices. The function f takes A to its inverse. The goal is to prove f is continuous. \n\nAssumptions here would be:\n1. The function f is defined on GLₙ(ℝ), which is the set of invertible n×n real matrices.\n2. GLₙ(ℝ) is equipped with the subspace topology from the space of all n×n real matrices.\n3. The function f maps each matrix A to its inverse A⁻¹.\n\nWait, but the user might have included some context. The original question mentions GLₙ(ℝ) as det⁻¹(ℝ\\{0}), which is correct since the determinant is continuous and the invertible matrices are those with non-zero determinant. However, in the assumptions, we need to list the properties given in the problem. The problem states f: GLₙ(ℝ) → GLₙ(ℝ), A ↦ A⁻¹. So the key assumptions are about the domain and codomain of f, the mapping itself, and the topology (implicitly, since continuity is about topology). But in the example given, the assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So here, the assumptions would be the properties given in the problem setup.\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n- f is a function from GLₙ(ℝ) to GLₙ(ℝ).\n- For each A in GLₙ(ℝ), f(A) = A⁻¹.\n- GLₙ(ℝ) is the set of invertible n×n real matrices, i.e., det(A) ≠ 0.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included the conditions on n. Here, the problem is about f being continuous, so the assumptions are the setup of the function f and the space it's acting on. The problem is to prove continuity. \n\nSo structured as:\n\nAssumption:\nf: GLₙ(ℝ) → GLₙ(ℝ) is a function,\nFor each A in GLₙ(ℝ), f(A) = A⁻¹,\nGLₙ(ℝ) is the set of invertible n×n real matrices,\nGLₙ(ℝ) is equipped with the subspace topology from Mₙ(ℝ).\n\nProblem: Prove that f is continuous.\n\nBut wait, the original problem statement says \"Prove that f is continuous.\" without specifying the topology. However, in the context, GLₙ(ℝ) is a subset of Mₙ(ℝ), the space of n×n matrices, which is a finite-dimensional real vector space, so the topology is implicitly the standard Euclidean topology, equivalent to the matrix norm topology. So maybe the assumption about the topology is necessary? But in the example given, the user didn't include implicit assumptions unless stated. The original problem mentions GLₙ(ℝ) as det⁻¹(ℝ \\ {0}), which refers to it being an open subset (since determinant is continuous), hence inheriting the subspace topology.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user didn't explicitly mention the topology. However, to be precise, maybe it's better to include that GLₙ(ℝ) has the subspace topology. But the example given by the user for the previous problem didn't include implicit assumptions like the topology. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The user structured the assumptions as \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the correct assumption is that n is an integer. However, the formatted problem in the example lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, but the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7. Wait, this seems contradictory. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal problem in example: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems incorrect. The original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should be \"n is an integer\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" which is not in the original problem. That seems like a mistake. Perhaps the user made an error in the example? Because if the original problem is to prove for every integer n, then the assumption should only be n is an integer. However, if the problem is to prove divisibility by 91 when n is divisible by 7, then that's different. Maybe the example has a typo or was incorrectly structured. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instruction based on their example, even if the example has an error.\n\nSo, in their example, they took the original problem which says \"for every integer n\" and in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That suggests that perhaps the user wants to extract not just the given assumptions but also any conditions that are implicit? Or maybe the original problem had a typo. Regardless, perhaps I should focus on the current problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's question is to prove that f: GLₙ(ℝ) → GLₙ(ℝ) given by f(A)=A⁻¹ is continuous. The assumptions here are that f is defined on GLₙ(ℝ), maps to GLₙ(ℝ), and each A is sent to its inverse. The problem is to prove continuity. So following the example's approach, even if the example might have had an error, perhaps the user wants to list all the given conditions as assumptions. The original question mentions GLₙ(ℝ) is det⁻¹(ℝ\\{0}), which is part of the definition, so that's an assumption.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- f is a function from GLₙ(ℝ) to GLₙ(ℝ).\n- For every A in GLₙ(ℝ), f(A) = A⁻¹.\n- GLₙ(ℝ) is the set of invertible n×n real matrices, defined as det⁻¹(ℝ \\ {0}).\n\nPossibly also that GLₙ(ℝ) has the subspace topology, but if the example didn't include such implicit assumptions, maybe not. Alternatively, the continuity is with respect to the standard topology on matrices. However, since the problem is to prove continuity, it's essential to specify the topology, but the problem statement doesn't mention it. However, in mathematical contexts, unless stated otherwise, continuity on matrix spaces is with respect to the standard Euclidean topology. So perhaps the user doesn't require including that assumption unless it's stated. Since the original problem doesn't specify the topology, maybe it's omitted. However, the example included an assumption not present in the original problem (n divisible by 7), which might indicate that the user wants to extract all possible conditions from the problem statement, even if they are definitions. So in this case, the fact that GLₙ(ℝ) is defined as det⁻¹(ℝ \\ {0}) is part of the problem's setup, so that's an assumption.\n\nSo structured:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a function from GLₙ(ℝ) to GLₙ(ℝ),\nFor each A in GLₙ(ℝ), f(A) = A⁻¹,\nGLₙ(ℝ) is the set of invertible n×n real matrices defined as det⁻¹(ℝ \\ {0}).\n\nProblem: Prove that f is continuous.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"f maps A to A⁻¹\" is one assumption, and \"GLₙ(ℝ) is the set of invertible matrices...\" is another. Each assumption on a separate line, addressing one property.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Each bullet point is a single assumption about one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a function with domain GLₙ(ℝ) and codomain GLₙ(ℝ),\nFor each matrix A in GLₙ(ℝ), f(A) is the inverse matrix of A,\nGLₙ(ℝ) is the set of n×n invertible real matrices,\nGLₙ(ℝ) is defined as det⁻¹(ℝ \\ {0}).\n\nWait, the last two could be combined, but according to the example, each line is one property. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe function f is defined on GLₙ(ℝ),\nThe codomain of f is GLₙ(ℝ),\nFor each A ∈ GLₙ(ℝ), f(A) = A⁻¹,\nGLₙ(ℝ) is the set of n×n real invertible matrices,\nGLₙ(ℝ) is equal to det⁻¹(ℝ \\ {0}).\n\nBut maybe some of these are redundant. Since GLₙ(ℝ) is defined as det⁻¹(ℝ \\ {0}), which is equivalent to being invertible matrices (since determinant non-zero). So perhaps the problem's original statement includes that definition, so it's part of the assumptions. Therefore, including that as a separate assumption.\n\nBut in the example, the user structured the problem's assumptions as:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7. So it's possible that the example is incorrect, and perhaps the user intended to extract all given conditions, even if they are definitions. Therefore, in the current problem, the assumptions should include all given definitions and conditions.\n\nThus, for the current problem:\n\nOriginal question states:\n\"Let f: GLₙ(ℝ) → GLₙ(ℝ) be a function which maps A ↦ A⁻¹. Prove that f is continuous. GLₙ(ℝ) = det⁻¹(ℝ \\ {0}) is the set of invertible matrices of order n×n with real coefficients.\"\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- f is a function from GLₙ(ℝ) to GLₙ(ℝ).\n- For each A in GLₙ(ℝ), f(A) = A⁻¹.\n- GLₙ(ℝ) is the set of invertible n×n real matrices.\n- GLₙ(ℝ) is equal to det⁻¹(ℝ \\ {0}).\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. However, perhaps the last two can be combined, but according to the example, each assumption is on a separate line. So yes, each gets its own line.\n\nProblem statement: Prove that f is continuous.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a function with domain GLₙ(ℝ) and codomain GLₙ(ℝ),\nFor every A in GLₙ(ℝ), f(A) = A⁻¹,\nGLₙ(ℝ) is the set of invertible n×n real matrices,\nGLₙ(ℝ) is defined as det⁻¹(ℝ \\ {0}).\nProblem:\nProve that f is continuous.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some of these can be phrased more concisely. For instance, combining the definition of GLₙ(ℝ):\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption is a single line. So I'll list them separately.",
