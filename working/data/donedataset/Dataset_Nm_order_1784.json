    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example they provided includes an assumption section and a problem section. The assumptions are supposed to list each condition or property applied to one object per line.\n\nThe original question is about whether the inequality √(a+b) ≤ √a + √b holds for all positive real numbers a and b. Then it extends to more variables. The title and the question body both mention the same thing. The user also tried to look it up but didn't know the name.\n\nFirst, I need to filter out unrelated information. The PS part about looking it up is probably not relevant. The part about more variables is a follow-up question, but the main problem is the two-variable case. The user is asking if the inequality holds for all positive a and b, and then what happens with more variables.\n\nIn the example given, the assumption section listed each condition. For this problem, the key assumptions are that a and b are positive real numbers. Since the problem is for all a, b in R_+, each variable's condition should be a separate line. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- a is a positive real number\n- b is a positive real number\n\nThen the problem statement is to prove that √(a+b) ≤ √a + √b for all positive real numbers a and b. The extension to more variables is a separate problem, but in the original example, the formatted problem included only the main part. So maybe the user wants the main problem here, and the extension to n variables could be an additional part, but according to the example, perhaps it's better to split into two problems? Wait, the example given had only the main problem. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem had an expression A(n) and the formatted problem included the main problem. The assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7, which was in the original problem. Wait, actually in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But wait, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But in the example, the formatted problem's assumption includes that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake because the original problem didn't state that n must be divisible by 7. Wait, perhaps the example is incorrect? Or maybe there was a typo. Hmm. Wait, the original problem in the example is to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But 91 is 13*7, so maybe the user wanted to split into cases where n is divisible by 7 or 13? But the example's formatted problem lists n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That might be an error. Maybe the example was structured with incorrect assumptions. However, I need to follow the user's example structure.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user is asking to format the problem as in the example. The example's assumptions were each condition on one object. So for the current problem, the assumptions are that a and b are positive real numbers. Each should be a separate line. So:\n\nAssumption:\na is a positive real number,\nb is a positive real number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that √(a+b) ≤ √a + √b.\n\nThen the user also asks about more variables. The question mentions two parts: the original inequality and the extension to n variables. Should both be included in the problem statement? The example only included the main problem. But in this case, the user wrote \"Moreover, what happens with more variables...\". So maybe the problem is two parts. However, in the example, the formatted problem didn't include the additional parts. Wait, the example's original problem mentioned \"for every integer n\", and the formatted problem included that as an assumption, but added another assumption that n is divisible by 7, which might be incorrect. Hmm, perhaps there was a mistake in the example. But regardless, the user wants to structure the problem as per the example, which for the current problem is:\n\nOriginal problem is asking about the inequality for a,b positive real, then extending to more variables. The example included only the main problem in the formatted version, even though the original mentioned \"for every integer n\". So perhaps in this case, the formatted problem should include both parts as separate problems? Or maybe split into two problems. But the example didn't do that. Alternatively, the user may want to include the main problem and the generalization as separate parts under the problem section. But in the example, the formatted problem only included the main expression. So perhaps the answer here should be:\n\nAssumption:\na is a positive real number,\nb is a positive real number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that √(a+b) ≤ √a + √b holds for all positive real numbers a and b. Moreover, investigate whether the inequality √(x₁ + x₂ + ... + xₙ) ≤ √x₁ + √x₂ + ... + √xₙ holds for all positive real numbers x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ.\n\nBut the example's problem section was concise. Alternatively, the original problem has two parts: the two-variable case and the n-variable case. Maybe the assumptions should cover all variables. Wait, but each assumption applies to one object. So for the n-variable case, we have:\n\nAssumptions:\nFor each i in {1,2,...,n}, x_i is a positive real number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that √(x₁ + x₂ + ... + xₙ) ≤ √x₁ + √x₂ + ... + √xₙ.\n\nBut since the original question includes both parts, perhaps the formatted problem should have two separate problems. But the user's example only included one problem. So maybe we need to structure it as two separate problem entries. However, the user's format requires a single problem section. Alternatively, the problem can be stated as two parts. However, the example's format has a single problem statement. So perhaps the user wants both parts in the problem statement. Let me check the original question's wording: \"Moreover, what happens with more variables?\" So the problem is two-fold: the original inequality and the generalization. So in the formatted problem, perhaps list both. The example's problem section was just the main problem, but maybe here, the problem section includes both.\n\nBut the example had the problem statement as \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91.\" So in this case, the problem would be to prove the inequality for a and b, and then investigate the case with more variables. Alternatively, since the original problem is a question, maybe it's structured as two separate problems. But given the example, it's better to structure each as a separate entry. However, the user's instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\" which implies one problem per entry. But the original question has two parts. Hmm.\n\nWait, the original example had a problem that was about proving a divisibility for every integer n, and the formatted problem included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which might be an error. But perhaps the user's example had a mistake. Regardless, for the current problem, the user's question on Math Stack Exchange includes both the two-variable case and the n-variable case. However, the main problem is the two-variable case, and the n-variable case is an extension. So perhaps the formatted problem should only include the two-variable case, and the extension is a follow-up. But since the user mentioned both, maybe include both.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to consider both cases. But in the example, only the main problem was included. So perhaps the answer should be:\n\nAssumption:\na is a positive real number,\nb is a positive real number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that √(a + b) ≤ √a + √b holds for all positive real numbers a and b. Additionally, determine whether the inequality generalizes to √(x₁ + x₂ + ... + xₙ) ≤ √x₁ + √x₂ + ... + √xₙ for positive real numbers x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ.\n\nBut the example's problem section was concise, just the problem statement. So maybe separate the two parts. However, the user's instruction is to structure \"the problem\" into the format. If the original question is two separate problems, maybe structure each as separate. But the example didn't do that. Given that, perhaps the answer is to structure the two-variable case as the main problem, and the n-variable case as another problem. But the user's example included only one problem. So perhaps the answer should have two entries. However, the user's format example shows one problem per entry. So maybe the user expects two separate formatted problems. But the original problem in the example had a single problem. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since the user's original question includes both the two-variable and the multi-variable case, but the example only formatted the main problem, maybe include both parts in the problem statement. So:\n\nAssumption:\na is a positive real number,\nb is a positive real number,\nFor each i ∈ {1,2,...,n}, x_i is a positive real number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that √(a + b) ≤ √a + √b and determine if √(x₁ + x₂ + ... + xₙ) ≤ √x₁ + √x₂ + ... + √xₙ holds for all positive real numbers x_i.\n\nBut the example's assumption lists each assumption line by line. So perhaps for the two-variable case:\n\nAssumption:\na is a positive real number,\nb is a positive real number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that √(a + b) ≤ √a + √b.\n\nThen for the multi-variable case:\n\nAssumption:\nFor each i ∈ {1,2,...,n}, x_i is a positive real number.\n\nProblem:\nDetermine if √(x₁ + x₂ + ... + xₙ) ≤ √x₁ + √x₂ + ... + √xₙ holds.\n\nBut the user's original question combines both. Given that, perhaps the answer should include both parts in the problem section, but list all assumptions. Alternatively, maybe the user wants two separate formatted entries. However, the instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\" implying one problem per answer. Therefore, perhaps the answer should be two separate formatted entries. But the example provided by the user included only one problem. Since the user hasn't specified, but provided an example with one problem, perhaps in this case, the answer should include both parts in the problem section, with the assumptions covering both. But the example had assumptions only for the main problem. Alternatively, the multi-variable case is a separate problem. Therefore, maybe two separate formatted entries.\n\nBut the user's instruction says \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" The original question includes both parts, so the formatted problem should include both. Therefore, in the problem section, list both parts. However, the example didn't split into two. Given that, I think the answer should be structured as follows:\n\nAssumption:\na is a positive real number,\nb is a positive real number,\nFor each i ∈ {1,2,...,n}, x_i is a positive real number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that √(a + b) ≤ √a + √b holds for all positive real numbers a and b. Additionally, determine whether the inequality √(x₁ + x₂ + ... + xₙ) ≤ √x₁ + √x₂ + ... + √xₙ holds for all positive real numbers x_i.\n\nBut this combines multiple assumptions. However, according to the example, each assumption is a single line for one object. So for the first part, a and b being positive reals, and for the second part, each x_i being positive reals. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- a is a positive real number\n- b is a positive real number\n- For each i ∈ {1,2,...,n}, x_i is a positive real number\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were specific to the problem. The original problem's first part is about a and b, the second about x_i. So combining them might be okay, but the problem statement should address both.\n\nHowever, the user might prefer separate entries. Since the example included only one problem, maybe the answer should focus on the main problem (the two-variable case), and the multi-variable case is a follow-up. But the user's original question includes both. Therefore, to stay true to the original question, include both in the problem statement with their respective assumptions.\n\nBut perhaps the user wants each assumption on separate lines. So:\n\nAssumption:\na is a positive real number,\nb is a positive real number,\nx_i is a positive real number for each i ∈ {1,2,...,n}.\n\nProblem:\nProve that √(a + b) ≤ √a + √b and determine if √(x₁ + x₂ + ... + xₙ) ≤ √x₁ + √x₂ + ... + √xₙ hold.\n\nBut the example's assumptions were specific. Alternatively, the user may want two separate entries. However, given the example, the user's answer should include both parts in the problem statement with their assumptions. Therefore, I'll proceed with that structure.",
