    "Content": "The wikipedia page on the cardinal numbers says that $\\aleph_0$, the cardinality of the set of natural numbers, is the smallest transfinite number. It doesn't provide a proof. Similarly, this page makes the same assertion, again without a proof. How does one prove there is no smaller transfinite number? Equivalently (I think), why is there no smaller infinite set than the natural numbers?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This is a consequence of the following theorem: Suppose that $A$ is a set of integers, then either $A$ is finite, or $|A|=|\\Bbb N|$. Since we define $\\aleph_0$ to be the cardinality of $\\Bbb N$, this means that every infinite subset of a set of size $\\aleph_0$ is itself of size $\\aleph_0$, and so there cannot be a smaller infinite cardinal. Note that the above proves that $\\aleph_0$ is a minimal element of the infinite cardinals. There is no smaller. To prove that it is in fact the smallest of the infinite cardinals we need to use some other set theoretical assumptions (e.g. every two cardinals are comparable) which are commonly assumed throughout mathematics nowadays. The proof of the aforementioned theorem is simple, by the way. Suppose that $A$ is infinite, then the map $a\\mapsto |\\{a'\\in A\\mid a'<a\\}|$ is a bijection between $A$ and $\\Bbb N$. The proof of that is by induction.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to figure out how to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question provided. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor, read the question, filter out unrelated info, and format it into the specified structure with Assumptions and Problem. Let me look at the example given to make sure I understand the format.\n\nThe example original problem was about proving a number is divisible by 91, and the formatted version listed assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Then the problem statement was the same but with those assumptions. Wait, but in the original problem, the user mentioned \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like they might have made a mistake? Or maybe the original problem had a typo. Hmm. But regardless, the key is to extract the assumptions from the problem as stated, not to add new ones. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds that n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Maybe the example was incorrect. Wait, perhaps the original problem had a different condition. Let me check again. \n\nWait, the example's original problem was: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like an error. Because if n is any integer, why would they add that it's divisible by 7? Maybe the example is wrong. But perhaps the user intended to show that the problem had an implicit assumption. Hmm, maybe I shouldn't dwell on that. Let me focus on the current problem.\n\nThe current question is about proving that aleph null is the smallest transfinite number. The user on Math Stack Exchange is asking for a proof that there's no smaller transfinite cardinal than aleph-null. So the problem is to prove that ℵ₀ is the smallest infinite cardinal, i.e., every infinite set has cardinality at least ℵ₀. Equivalently, that every infinite set has a countably infinite subset, which would imply its cardinality is at least ℵ₀.\n\nSo first, the assumptions. The problem is in set theory, specifically about cardinal numbers. The assumptions here would be based on the standard ZFC axioms. But the question doesn't state any specific assumptions, it's more general. However, in the example, the user listed assumptions as properties or conditions applied to one object. In this case, the problem is about the cardinality of sets, so the assumptions would relate to the properties of infinite sets and their cardinalities.\n\nWait, but the original problem as stated by the user doesn't specify any particular conditions except that we're dealing with transfinite numbers, which are infinite cardinal numbers. So perhaps the assumptions here are:\n\n- We are working within ZFC set theory.\n- A set is infinite if it is not finite.\n- The cardinality of a set is the smallest ordinal number equinumerous with it (assuming the axiom of choice to have cardinal numbers as initial ordinals).\n\nBut maybe in the problem statement, the key assumption is that we are considering the standard definition of cardinal numbers, where ℵ₀ is the cardinality of the natural numbers. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The set of natural numbers is infinite.\n- Any set with cardinality less than ℵ₀ is finite.\n- The ordering of cardinals is such that if there exists an injection from set A to set B, then the cardinality of A is less than or equal to that of B.\n\nBut the problem is to show there's no infinite set with cardinality smaller than ℵ₀. So equivalently, every infinite set has a countably infinite subset. To prove this, we need the axiom of choice? Wait, does the proof require AC?\n\nWait, in ZF, without choice, it's possible to have infinite sets that are Dedekind-finite, meaning they have no countably infinite subsets. So in that case, such a set would be infinite but have cardinality incomparable with ℵ₀. But if we assume AC, then every infinite set is Dedekind-infinite, hence has a countably infinite subset, hence its cardinality is at least ℵ₀. Therefore, the assumption here might be that we're working in ZFC (with the axiom of choice). But the original question might not specify this. So perhaps the assumption is that the axiom of choice holds.\n\nBut the problem as stated by the user says \"How does one prove there is no smaller transfinite number? Equivalently (I think), why is there no smaller infinite set than the natural numbers?\" So they are assuming that the natural numbers are the \"smallest\" infinite set, which in ZFC is true, but in ZF might not be.\n\nTherefore, the key assumptions here would be:\n\n- The axiom of choice is assumed (to ensure every infinite set is Dedekind-infinite).\n- A set is infinite if it is not finite.\n- The cardinal numbers are defined in the standard way (using initial ordinals if we have AC).\n\nBut the user's example listed specific assumptions about the problem's variables. Here, maybe the problem is more general. Let me try to extract the assumptions as per the user's format, which requires each assumption to address one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nLooking back at the example, the original problem was about n being any integer, but in the formatted problem, they listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the original problem, it was for every integer n, so the divisibility by 7 wasn't mentioned. That suggests maybe the example was incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in their example. Regardless, I need to follow the instructions given.\n\nSo, for the current problem: \"Prove that aleph null is the smallest transfinite number\". The assumptions would need to be listed line by line, each addressing only one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nPossible assumptions:\n\n- The axiom of choice holds. (But does the problem assume AC? The original question might not specify, but in standard math, cardinality comparisons often assume AC.)\n- A set is infinite if it is not finite.\n- The cardinality of the natural numbers is ℵ₀.\n- Two sets have the same cardinality if there exists a bijection between them.\n- If there is an injection from set A to set B, then the cardinality of A is less than or equal to that of B.\n\nBut these are more like definitions and axioms. However, the problem might be assuming the standard definitions. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that we are working within ZFC set theory.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption is a single property/condition applied to one object. For instance, in the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and n divisible by 7. So in this problem, perhaps the assumptions are about the sets involved.\n\nWait, but the problem is about proving that there's no smaller transfinite number than ℵ₀. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- There exists an infinite set (the natural numbers).\n- Any set that is infinite must have a cardinality at least ℵ₀.\n\nBut that's circular. Wait, perhaps the key assumption is that every infinite set has a countably infinite subset. Which is equivalent (under AC) to being Dedekind-infinite. So if we assume that every infinite set is Dedekind-infinite, then we can prove that ℵ₀ is the smallest infinite cardinal.\n\nAlternatively, the assumptions needed for the proof might be:\n\n- The axiom of choice is true.\n- Any infinite set contains a countably infinite subset.\n\nBut again, maybe the problem is presented in a context where AC is assumed. The user's question on Math Stack Exchange is probably assuming standard ZFC.\n\nBut how to structure this into the required assumptions? Each assumption should be a single property/condition on one object. Let me think.\n\nMaybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe axiom of choice holds.\nEvery infinite set is Dedekind-infinite.\nThe cardinality of the set of natural numbers is ℵ₀.\nFor any set S, if there exists an injection from ℕ to S, then |ℕ| ≤ |S|.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, the problem might be presented without reference to axioms, just assuming standard results. For example, the problem is to show that there's no infinite set with cardinality less than ℵ₀. To do this, you could use the fact that any infinite set has a countable subset, which requires some form of choice. So perhaps the key assumption is the axiom of countable choice, or the axiom of choice.\n\nBut the user's example didn't list axioms as assumptions. The example's assumptions were about the variable n. So maybe in this problem, the assumptions are about the sets involved.\n\nWait, the problem is to prove that ℵ₀ is the smallest transfinite number. The equivalent formulation is that there's no infinite set with cardinality smaller than ℵ₀. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- S is an infinite set.\n- There exists a countably infinite subset of S.\n\nIf we can show that, then |S| ≥ |ℕ| = ℵ₀. So the assumption here would be that S is infinite, and from that, we can extract a countable subset. But how to frame this as assumptions?\n\nAlternatively, the assumptions for the problem might be:\n\n- Let S be an infinite set.\n- The axiom of choice is assumed.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that |S| ≥ ℵ₀.\n\nBut according to the user's example, assumptions are listed as separate points, each about one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nS is an infinite set.\nThe axiom of choice holds.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the cardinality of S is at least ℵ₀.\n\nBut the original question is phrased as \"Prove that aleph null is the smallest transfinite number\", which is equivalent to saying that every infinite set has cardinality at least ℵ₀. So the assumptions would be that S is any infinite set, and we need to show |S| ≥ ℵ₀.\n\nBut maybe the assumptions are just that we're working in ZFC, and the problem is to prove the statement.\n\nBut the user's format seems to want explicit assumptions listed. Perhaps the key assumption here is the axiom of choice, because without it, the statement isn't necessarily true. Therefore, the assumption would be:\n\n- The axiom of choice holds.\n\nProblem: Prove that ℵ₀ is the smallest transfinite cardinal number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumption is that every infinite set has a countably infinite subset.\n\nBut in standard ZFC, that's a theorem derived from AC. So perhaps the assumption is the axiom of choice.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be presented without mentioning axioms, so the assumption is simply that S is an infinite set, and the problem is to show that |S| ≥ ℵ₀.\n\nBut I need to follow the example's structure. In the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", and the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the original problem, there was no mention of divisibility by 7. That seems like a mistake. Maybe the user intended to present a different problem. But regardless, the key is that each assumption is a single condition on one object.\n\nFor the current problem, maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- S is an infinite set.\n- The cardinality of S is a transfinite number.\n\nProblem: Prove that the cardinality of S is at least ℵ₀.\n\nBut that seems redundant. Alternatively, the assumptions are:\n\n- The axiom of choice is true.\n- S is an infinite set.\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists an injection from ℕ to S.\n\nWhich would imply |ℕ| ≤ |S|, hence ℵ₀ ≤ |S|.\n\nAlternatively, the problem as stated by the user is \"Prove that aleph null is the smallest transfinite number\", so the assumptions would be the properties that make ℵ₀ the smallest. But I think the key here is that in ZFC, every infinite set has a countably infinite subset, which requires the axiom of choice.\n\nTherefore, the assumption is the axiom of choice. But the user's example didn't include such foundational axioms, it included assumptions about the variable in the problem.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Maybe the problem doesn't have explicit assumptions beyond the definitions of cardinal numbers and infinite sets. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- A transfinite number is the cardinality of an infinite set.\n- The cardinality of the natural numbers is ℵ₀.\n- Any set with cardinality less than ℵ₀ is finite.\n\nBut these are more like definitions. The problem then is to show that there's no transfinite number smaller than ℵ₀, which would follow from the fact that any infinite set has at least cardinality ℵ₀.\n\nBut how to structure this. Maybe the key assumption is that if a set is infinite, then it has a subset of cardinality ℵ₀. Which is equivalent to saying it's Dedekind-infinite. So the assumption would be:\n\n- Every infinite set is Dedekind-infinite.\n\nWhich in ZF is not necessarily true without AC. So if we assume that, then we can prove that ℵ₀ is the smallest transfinite cardinal.\n\nBut again, the user's example had assumptions about the variable, not about the axioms. Therefore, maybe in this problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- Let κ be a transfinite number.\n- κ is the cardinality of an infinite set.\n\nProblem: Prove that κ ≥ ℵ₀.\n\nBut I need to check the original question again. The original question says: \"How does one prove there is no smaller transfinite number? Equivalently (I think), why is there no smaller infinite set than the natural numbers?\"\n\nSo the equivalence is between \"no smaller transfinite number\" and \"no infinite set smaller than naturals\". The user is asking for a proof of either statement.\n\nIn terms of assumptions, to prove that every infinite set has at least the cardinality of ℕ, we need to show that for any infinite S, there's an injection from ℕ to S. This requires some form of choice. Without choice, it's possible to have infinite sets without countably infinite subsets.\n\nSo the assumption here would be the axiom of choice, or at least the axiom of countable choice.\n\nBut in the context of a typical math course, AC is often assumed without mention. However, since the problem is about cardinal numbers, which in standard treatment rely on AC to ensure every set has a cardinality, the assumption is that we're working in ZFC.\n\nBut according to the user's example, assumptions are listed as separate points about the problem's conditions. So maybe the assumptions here are:\n\n- The axiom of choice holds.\n- S is an infinite set.\n\nProblem: Prove that |S| ≥ ℵ₀.\n\nAlternatively, if we don't mention AC, then the assumptions might be:\n\n- S is an infinite set.\n- There exists a countably infinite subset of S.\n\nBut that's what we need to prove. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that any infinite set can be well-ordered (which is equivalent to AC), allowing us to construct a countably infinite subset by induction.\n\nI think the key here is that the proof requires the axiom of choice, so the assumption should include AC. Therefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nThe axiom of choice holds.\nS is an infinite set.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the cardinality of S is at least ℵ₀.\n\nBut maybe the original question doesn't mention a specific set S, so the problem is more general. So the assumptions are:\n\n- The axiom of choice holds.\n- Any transfinite number is the cardinality of an infinite set.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ℵ₀ is the smallest transfinite number.\n\nAlternatively, since the original question is about the minimality of ℵ₀, the assumptions could be:\n\n- The cardinal numbers are well-ordered.\n- ℵ₀ is the cardinality of the natural numbers.\n\nBut that's not helpful. I think the main assumption needed is the axiom of choice. However, in many mathematical contexts, AC is assumed, so maybe the user expects that.\n\nAlternatively, the assumptions are just the standard definitions:\n\n- A set is infinite if it is not finite.\n- A cardinal number is an equivalence class of sets under bijection.\n- ℵ₀ is the cardinality of the set of natural numbers.\n\nProblem: Prove that there is no cardinal number κ such that κ is infinite and κ < ℵ₀.\n\nBut the proof of this requires showing that every infinite set has a countably infinite subset, which uses AC. So perhaps the assumption is the axiom of choice.\n\nBut the user's example listed assumptions about the problem's variables, not about the axiomatic framework. Therefore, maybe in this problem, the only assumption is that we're dealing with an infinite set, and the problem is to show its cardinality is at least ℵ₀.\n\nBut without AC, this isn't necessarily true. So perhaps the answer must include AC as an assumption.\n\nIn conclusion, to format the problem as per the user's instructions, the assumptions should include the axiom of choice, and the problem is to prove that ℵ₀ is the smallest transfinite cardinal. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe axiom of choice holds.\nEvery infinite set has a countably infinite subset.\nℵ₀ is the cardinality of the set of natural numbers.\nProblem:\nProve that there is no transfinite number smaller than ℵ₀.\n\nBut each assumption should be a single line, each about one object. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe axiom of choice holds.\nS is an infinite set.\nℕ denotes the set of natural numbers.\nThe cardinality of ℕ is ℵ₀.\nProblem:\nProve that the cardinality of S is at least ℵ₀.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is about transfinite numbers, maybe the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nA transfinite number is the cardinality of an infinite set.\nThe cardinality of ℕ is ℵ₀.\nThe axiom of choice holds.\nProblem:\nProve that ℵ₀ is the smallest transfinite number.\n\nBut the user's example had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Similarly, here, we might list:\n\nAssumption:\nThe axiom of choice holds.\nA transfinite number is an infinite cardinal number.\nProblem:\nProve that ℵ₀ is the smallest transfinite number.\n\nBut the term \"transfinite number\" is sometimes used interchangeably with infinite cardinal numbers in this context. The key is that under AC, the infinite cardinals are well-ordered, starting with ℵ₀.\n\nIn the end, given the user's example, perhaps the assumptions are more about the objects involved rather than the axiomatic framework. But given that the proof hinges on AC, it's important to include it as an assumption. However, the original question on Math Stack Exchange doesn't mention AC, so maybe the answer is expected to assume it implicitly.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the formatted problem is:\n\nAssumption:\nEvery infinite set has a countably infinite subset.\nℵ₀ is the cardinality of the set of natural numbers.\nProblem:\nProve that ℵ₀ is the smallest transfinite number.\n\nBut \"every infinite set has a countably infinite subset\" is a consequence of AC, so maybe that's the assumption. Alternatively, the assumption is the axiom of choice.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to show there's no smaller infinite cardinal, and given that in ZFC every infinite set is Dedekind-infinite, the assumption is:\n\nAssumption:\nEvery infinite set is Dedekind-infinite.\nProblem:\nProve that ℵ₀ is the smallest transfinite cardinal number.\n\nBut I need to make sure each assumption is a single line, one property per object.\n\nFinal attempt:\n\nAssumption:\nThe axiom of choice is true.\nThe set of natural numbers is infinite.\nThe cardinality of a set is represented by the smallest ordinal number bijective with it.\nProblem:\nProve that ℵ₀ is the smallest transfinite number.\n\nBut the cardinality definition might be too detailed. Alternatively, simplify:\n\nAssumption:\nThe axiom of choice holds.\nℵ₀ is the cardinality of the set of natural numbers.\nProblem:\nProve that every infinite set has cardinality at least ℵ₀.\n\nThis seems concise and includes the necessary assumptions. Each assumption is a single line. The first line assumes AC, which is needed for the proof. The second line defines ℵ₀. The problem is then to show that any infinite set has cardinality ≥ ℵ₀.",
