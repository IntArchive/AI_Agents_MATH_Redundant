    "Content": "Let $n$ be a positive integer. I know the traditional proof that $e$ is irrational. How do we show that $e^n$ is irrational in some sort of similar line? I am of course assuming it is but I would be astounded if not. It occurs to me that since $e$ is transcendental, of course $e^n$ is irrational, but I don't want to use that fact. Googling gives me something for $e^2$, but I could not easily find anything for $e^3$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about proving the irrationality of e^n where n is a positive integer. The user mentions knowing the traditional proof for e being irrational but wants a similar approach for e^n without invoking transcendence. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The problem states that n is a positive integer. That's one assumption. The user also mentions they are assuming e^n is irrational but want a proof without using transcendence. However, the assumptions section should only include conditions given in the problem, not the user's thoughts. So the main assumption here is that n is a positive integer. The problem is to prove that e^n is irrational, following a similar line to the traditional proof for e. \n\nWait, the example provided had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem, the user didn't specify that. The example might have been a specific case. In this case, the original problem just states n is a positive integer. So the assumption here is that n is a positive integer, and the problem is to prove e^n is irrational without using transcendence.\n\nI need to make sure there are no other hidden assumptions. The user wants a method similar to the traditional proof for e, which typically involves assuming the opposite and deriving a contradiction using series expansions. So the key assumption is n being a positive integer. There's no mention of any restrictions on n beyond that, so I shouldn't add extra conditions like divisibility unless specified. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list the assumption that n is a positive integer and the problem is to prove e^n is irrational. The user explicitly states not to use the fact that e is transcendental, so maybe that's a note but not part of the assumption. However, the format requires assumptions to be listed, so the main one is n being a positive integer. The problem is to show irrationality of e^n without invoking transcendence.",
