    "Content": "I'm trying to prove the following inequality: $$\\prod_{1\\leq i,j\\leq n}\\frac{1+a_ia_j}{1-a_ia_j}\\geq1\\tag{1}$$ for $a_i\\in(-1,1)$ . I first tried induction but doesn't seem to work well. Special cases can be proved like $n=2,3$ using brute force but I am trying to find a simpler proof. Some observations: Define the function $f_n(x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n)=\\prod_{1\\leq i,j\\leq n}\\frac{1+x_ix_j}{1-x_ix_j}$ for $(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\in(-1,1)^n$ . Note that if $a_i\\geq0$ for all $i$ then all the terms in the product are at least $1$ and hence $(1)$ is trivially true. So, is it possible to prove the following? $$f_n(x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n)\\geq1\\iff f_n(-x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n)\\geq1$$ , if yes then by symmetry we can repeat this process and make all $a_i\\geq0$ . Also, using Induction we can do the following: Base case $n=1$ is trivial. Assuming for some $n\\geq1$ , we see that $$f_n(x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n)f_n(-x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n)=f_{n-1}(x_2,\\ldots,x_n)^2\\geq1$$ and hence at least one of the following is true: $f_n(x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n)\\geq1$ or $f_n(-x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n)\\geq1$ . The case of equality As @RiverLi pointed out and @MartinR wrote an answer, it is evident that equality holds if and only if $$\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{2k-1}\\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^{2k-1}\\right)^2=0$$ The partial sums form an increasing sequence of nonnegative reals. So, the series can evaluate to zero if and only if $$\\sum_{i=1}^na_i^{2k-1}=0,k\\geq1$$ which is a separate and interesting problem and is discussed here.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Found here on AoPS: For $-1 < x < 1$ we have the Taylor series $$\n \\ln (1+x) = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{k} x^k \\, ,\n$$ which implies $$\n\\ln(1+x) - \\ln(1-x) = 2\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{2k-1} x^{2k-1} \\, .\n$$ It follows that $$\n\\sum_{i, j=1}^n \\bigl(\\ln(1+a_ia_j) - \\ln(1-a_ia_j)\\bigr)\n= 2 \\sum_{i, j=1}^n \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{2k-1} a_i^{2k-1}a_j^{2k-1} \\\\\n= 2 \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{2k-1}\\sum_{i, j=1}^n a_i^{2k-1}a_j^{2k-1}\n= 2 \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{2k-1} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^{2k-1}\\right)^2 \\ge 0 \\, .\n$$ This proves that the logarithm of $\\prod_{1\\leq i,j\\leq n}\\frac{1+a_ia_j}{1-a_ia_j}$ is non-negative, so that the product is $\\ge 1$ . Remark: With the substitution $a_i = \\tanh(x_i)$ one can see that the inequality is equivalent to $$\nx_1, \\ldots, x_n \\in \\Bbb R \\implies \\prod_{i, j = 1}^n \\frac{\\cosh(x_i + x_j)}{\\cosh(x_i - x_j)} \\ge 1 \\, ,\n$$ and the substitution $a_i = \\tan(y_i)$ shows that it is also equivalent to $$\ny_1, \\ldots, y_n \\in (-\\frac \\pi 4,  \\frac \\pi 4) \\implies \\prod_{i, j = 1}^n \\frac{\\cos(y_i - y_j)}{\\cos(y_i + y_j)} \\ge 1 \\, .\n$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to format the given problem according to the user's instructions. The original question is about proving an inequality involving a product of terms with variables a_i in (-1,1). The user provided an example where assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition for one object. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions in the problem. The problem states that a_i are real numbers in (-1,1). The original example had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, the variables a_i are given with their domain. However, in the problem statement, the user mentions that each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So each a_i is in (-1,1), but since it's for all i from 1 to n, how should this be listed? \n\nWait, the original example had two separate assumptions about n: being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem states \"for n real numbers a_i ∈ (-1,1)\". So perhaps each a_i is a separate assumption? But that would be redundant. Alternatively, the assumption is that each a_i is in (-1,1). Since there are n numbers, but the problem states \"for n real numbers a_i ∈ (-1,1)\", so maybe the assumption is that each a_i is in (-1,1). But how to phrase it? \n\nLooking at the example, the assumption was \"n is an integer\", then another assumption \"n is divisible by 7\". So each line is a separate condition. Here, the main condition is that each a_i is in (-1,1). But since there are multiple a_i's, maybe the assumption should be written as \"For each i, a_i ∈ (-1,1)\" or \"Each a_i is a real number in the interval (-1,1)\". But the user's example used \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\" as separate lines. So perhaps here, the assumption is \"a_i ∈ (-1,1) for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n\". But the user's instruction says \"each assumption addresses only one property or condition, applied to one object\". Wait, in the example, the two assumptions were both about n. So maybe here, the single assumption is that all a_i are in (-1,1). But the user wants each assumption line to address one property or condition for one object. So if the objects are each a_i, then each a_i being in (-1,1) is one condition per a_i. But there are n a_i's. But writing all of them as separate lines would be impractical. So maybe the correct way is to state that each a_i is in (-1,1), but written as a single assumption covering all i. The example didn't have multiple variables but a single variable n. So perhaps here, the assumption is \"For all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, a_i is a real number in (-1,1)\". But the user's example wrote \"n is an integer\", \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate lines. So maybe here, the assumption is two parts: each a_i is real, and each a_i is in (-1,1). But in the problem statement, the user says \"for n real numbers a_i ∈ (-1,1)\", so perhaps the two conditions are that a_i are real and each is in (-1,1). So split into two assumptions: \"a_i are real numbers\" and \"For each 1 ≤ i ≤ n, a_i ∈ (-1,1)\". However, the problem statement says \"n real numbers a_i ∈ (-1,1)\", which combines both real and the interval. But according to the example, separate conditions are split. Wait, the example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate lines, even though the original problem just said \"for every integer n\". So maybe in this case, the original problem's assumptions would be split into two: \"a_i are real numbers\" and \"For each 1 ≤ i ≤ n, a_i ∈ (-1,1)\". So each of these is a separate assumption.\n\nBut the original problem statement says \"for $n$ real numbers $a_i\\in(-1,1)$\", so combining both real and the interval. But following the example's structure, we need to split them. However, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, no. Wait, the original example had the problem statement: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) [...] is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem's assumption was \"n is an integer\", \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but that's not correct. Wait, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the user listed two assumptions: \"n is an integer\", and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect because the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7. Wait, the example provided by the user might be incorrect. Wait, let me check the example again.\n\nUser's example:\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn is divisible by 7.\nProblem: Prove that A(n) [...] is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, it's \"for every integer n\", so n is any integer. But in the formatted problem, the user added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems wrong. Because the original problem does not require n to be divisible by 7. The correct assumption should only be that n is an integer. But maybe this is a mistake in the example. However, the user is instructing me to follow their format, so perhaps in their example, they made an error. But regardless, the task is to follow the user's format as per their example. So in their example, they split the original problem's condition into two assumptions: n is integer and n divisible by 7, even though the original problem didn't have the divisible by 7 part. That suggests that perhaps the user's example is incorrect, but we need to follow their structure.\n\nBut in the current problem, the original problem states that a_i are in (-1,1). So according to the user's example format, we need to split the assumptions into separate lines. However, the problem here only has one condition: each a_i is a real number in (-1,1). There's no other condition. So perhaps the assumption is just that. But the user's example splits \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", even though the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7. That suggests that perhaps in the example, the user made a mistake, or maybe the original problem had hidden assumptions. Wait, 91 is 7*13, so maybe the user assumed n is divisible by both 7 and 13? But in the original problem, it's for every integer n. So perhaps the example is incorrect. But the user is the one providing the example, so we need to follow it as is.\n\nGiven that, for the current problem, the only assumption is that each a_i is in (-1,1). But according to the user's example, they split into two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But here, the original problem says \"for n real numbers a_i ∈ (-1,1)\". So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nEach a_i is a real number,\nEach a_i is in the interval (-1,1).\n\nBut in the problem statement, it's given as \"n real numbers a_i ∈ (-1,1)\", which combines both. But according to the user's example, we split into separate lines. So even if the original problem combines them, we split into separate assumptions. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\na_i are real numbers for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n,\nFor each 1 ≤ i ≤ n, a_i ∈ (-1,1).\n\nBut since the problem states \"n real numbers a_i ∈ (-1,1)\", it's already specifying that they are real and in that interval. However, following the user's example where they split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", even though the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7, perhaps there's a misunderstanding. But in this case, there's no additional hidden assumption. The problem only has the condition that a_i are real numbers in (-1,1). So perhaps the correct assumption is just one line: \"For each 1 ≤ i ≤ n, a_i is a real number in (-1,1)\". But according to the user's example, they split conditions into separate lines. However, here, there is only one condition per a_i: being in (-1,1). But since the variables are real, maybe the first assumption is \"a_i are real numbers\" and the second is \"a_i ∈ (-1,1) for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n\". But in the original problem statement, it's already stated as \"n real numbers a_i ∈ (-1,1)\", so the realness is part of the problem's given. So perhaps we need to split it into two assumptions: each a_i is real, and each a_i is in (-1,1). Therefore, the assumptions would be two lines:\n\na_i are real numbers for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n,\nFor each 1 ≤ i ≤ n, a_i ∈ (-1,1).\n\nBut perhaps the user considers \"real numbers\" as part of the problem's inherent definition, and the interval as the assumption. But in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which was split into \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", but that second part is not in the original problem. That suggests that the example might have an error. However, since we have to follow the user's format, we need to list each assumption line by line. Since the problem states \"for n real numbers a_i ∈ (-1,1)\", the two conditions are: a_i are real, and a_i are in (-1,1). So the assumptions would be:\n\nFor each 1 ≤ i ≤ n, a_i is a real number,\nFor each 1 ≤ i ≤ n, a_i ∈ (-1,1).\n\nBut maybe \"real numbers\" is implicit, but in the example, \"n is an integer\" was listed, so here, being real is an assumption. Therefore, the formatted problem's assumptions are two lines. However, the problem may not have any other assumptions. So maybe the only assumption is \"For each 1 ≤ i ≤ n, a_i is a real number in (-1,1)\". But following the user's example, we need to split if possible. Since \"real\" and \"interval\" are separate properties, we can split them. Thus:\n\nAssumption:\nFor each 1 ≤ i ≤ n, a_i is a real number,\nFor each 1 ≤ i ≤ n, a_i ∈ (-1,1).\n\nThen the problem is as stated. \n\nChecking the original problem again: \"for $n$ real numbers $a_i\\in(-1,1)$\". So yes, combining real and interval. But according to the example, split into two. So in the formatted problem, two assumptions. Then the problem statement is to prove the product is ≥1.",
