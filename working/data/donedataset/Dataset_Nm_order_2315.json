    "AcceptedAnswer": "The deRham map gives an arrow $\\theta:H_{dR}(X) \\to H(X)^*$, and the algebra structure on the right is induced from the coalgebra structue on $H(X)$ given by the Alexander-Whitney coproduct: $\\Delta(\\sigma) = \\sum \\sigma_i \\otimes \\sigma^i$ where $\\sigma_i$ is the front $i$-face and $\\sigma^i$ is the back $i$-face. Denote by $\\langle -,-\\rangle : H_{dR}(X)\\otimes H(X)^*\\to \\mathbb R$ pairing that gives rise to $\\theta$. In terms of the pairing, you are correct this is the same as stating that, for any two forms $\\omega,\\eta$ of degee $p,q$ and any singular chain $\\sigma$ of degree $p+q$, we have that\n$$\\tag{1}\\langle \\omega\\wedge \\eta,\\sigma\\rangle = \\langle \\omega,\\sigma_p\\rangle\\langle \\eta,\\sigma^p\\rangle$$\nwhich is the same as $\\langle \\mu,-\\rangle =\\mu_\\mathbb R\\langle - \\otimes -,\\Delta\\rangle$. You also note that there is a problem of writing simplices as products. There is a way of fixing this problem, which is (as Spivak does and in another context, Serre does), for example, done by working with singular cubes instead of singular chains. Concretely, compute $H_*(X)$ using maps $\\sigma : [0,1]^*\\to X$. The differential is another, but the coproduct is simply given by restricting to coordinates, as in the case of simplices (though more terms appear). Concretely, if $\\sigma : [0,1]^p\\to M$ is a singular cube, the coproduct of $\\sigma$ is given by a sum $$\\sum_{A\\sqcup B = [p]}\\sigma_A^0\\otimes \\sigma_B^1 $$\nwhere $(-)_S^\\varepsilon$ means you set the $S$-coordinates of the subset $S$ of $[p] = \\{1,\\ldots,p\\}$ to $\\varepsilon$ and keep the coordinates of the complement. See page 17 in Serre's thesis .\n In this case, if $\\sigma$ is a singular cube and $\\omega = fdx_I$ is a form of the same degree $p$, it is straightforward to check that $$\\langle \\omega,\\sigma\\rangle = \\int_{[0,1]^p} f(\\sigma) J_\\sigma dx_1\\cdots dx_p$$ and then $(1)$ is an immediate consequence of Fubini's theorem, as you wanted. There is a natural isomorphism between $H(X)$ computed in two different ways, either from cubical or simplicial singular chains, coming from a map from the cubical complex of $X$ to the singular complex of $X$ that needs to respect the coproduct (this is the nontrivial part of you question, I think, but you can find this map say in Serre's thesis), and this completes the proof that the deRham isomoprhism is a map of algebras.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand exactly what's being asked here. The user is asking whether the wedge product in de Rham cohomology corresponds to the cup product in singular cohomology under the isomorphism given by de Rham's theorem. Specifically, they want to prove that the integral of a wedge product over a simplex is equal to the product of the integrals over the front and back parts of the simplex, which would mimic the cup product definition.\n\nLet me start by recalling the key concepts. De Rham's theorem states that the integration map I, which sends a differential form ω to the cohomology class represented by the integral of ω over smooth cycles, is an isomorphism between de Rham cohomology and singular cohomology with real coefficients. Now, both cohomology theories have product structures: the wedge product for de Rham and the cup product for singular. The question is whether these products are compatible under the isomorphism I.\n\nThe user attempted to show this by directly integrating the wedge product over a (p+q)-simplex and relating it to the product of integrals over the front q-face and back p-face of the simplex. However, they ran into trouble because the standard simplex isn't a product space, so Fubini's theorem doesn't apply directly. My first thought is that maybe we need to use a subdivision of the simplex or some kind of approximation that allows us to decompose the integral into parts.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a more algebraic topological approach here. The cup product in singular cohomology is defined using the front and back faces of a simplex, as per the formula given. The wedge product, on the other hand, is defined pointwise and then integrated. To relate these, perhaps we need to use the properties of the de Rham isomorphism and how it interacts with products.\n\nI remember that in cohomology theories, the cup product and wedge product are both graded commutative and satisfy certain compatibility conditions with differentials. Since both products behave similarly with respect to the codifferential d, maybe we can use some universal property or homological algebra to show that the isomorphism I must preserve these products. But the user mentioned they tried this and didn't succeed, so maybe a more direct approach is needed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the Universal Coefficient Theorem or some naturality argument. If the de Rham isomorphism is a natural transformation, then it should commute with products. But I need to check if this is the case. Naturality here would mean that the isomorphism I commutes with induced maps, but does that extend to products?\n\nAnother angle is to use the fact that both cohomology theories are defined on smooth manifolds and that the cup product in singular cohomology can be related to the wedge product via smooth approximations. Since we're dealing with smooth simplices, perhaps we can pull back the wedge product and compare it to the cup product at the cochain level.\n\nWait, the problem mentions that the standard simplex isn't a product space, so Fubini doesn't apply. But maybe we can parameterize the simplex in such a way that allows us to split the integral into two parts. For example, consider the standard (p+q)-simplex as a composition of maps or use a prism decomposition. I recall that in algebraic topology, to prove homotopy invariance or other properties, we often use prism operators or triangulations that break down the space into manageable pieces.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the Eilenberg-Zilber theorem, which relates the chain complex of a product space to the tensor product of chain complexes. But since we're not dealing with a product space here, maybe an analogous approach is needed. The Eilenberg-Zilber map gives a quasi-isomorphism between the chain complex of a product and the tensor product of chain complexes, which could be used to relate products in cohomology.\n\nBut wait, the cup product is defined using the Alexander-Whitney map, which is a specific chain approximation to the diagonal. The diagonal map sends a simplex to its product with itself, but since we can't have a simplex as a product, the Alexander-Whitney map approximates this by splitting the simplex into front and back faces. So maybe the key is to relate the wedge product, which is a cup product at the cochain level, through this Alexander-Whitney map.\n\nLet me think about cochains. In de Rham cohomology, the wedge product of forms corresponds to the cup product at the cochain level if we can show that integrating the wedge product over a simplex equals the cup product of the integrals. But to do this, we might need to express the wedge product in terms of the cup product structure.\n\nAlternatively, since the de Rham isomorphism is a chain map, it should induce a ring isomorphism if it preserves the multiplicative structures. To show this, we need to verify that I(ω ∧ η) = I(ω) ∪ I(η). This equality is what needs to be proven, and it should hold for all cohomology classes.\n\nLet me try to write this out. Take smooth representatives ω and η for classes in de Rham cohomology. Then I(ω) is the singular cohomology class represented by the cocycle that integrates ω over smooth chains. Similarly for η. The cup product I(ω) ∪ I(η) in singular cohomology is then the class that acts on a (p+q)-simplex σ by multiplying the integrals of ω over the front q-face and η over the back p-face of σ.\n\nOn the other hand, I(ω ∧ η) is the class that integrates ω ∧ η over the entire (p+q)-simplex σ. So the equality we need is:\n\n∫_{σ} ω ∧ η = ∫_{σ|_{[e_0,...,e_q]} } ω  ·  ∫_{σ|_{[e_q,...,e_{q+p}]} } η\n\nBut as the user noted, σ is not a product of the front and back faces, so Fubini's theorem can't be applied directly. However, maybe there's a way to decompose σ into a combination of products of simplices, or to use a chain homotopy equivalence that allows such a decomposition.\n\nAlternatively, consider using the properties of differential forms and Stokes' theorem. If we can express the wedge product in terms of pullbacks along certain maps, maybe we can split the integral. For instance, the front face inclusion and the back face inclusion might allow us to pull back ω and η separately and then combine them.\n\nWait, here's another thought. The wedge product of ω and η is a (p+q)-form, and when integrated over σ, it can be expressed using the pullback of σ to the standard simplex. Maybe we can parameterize σ in such a way that separates the variables corresponding to the front and back faces. For example, if we can write the standard (p+q)-simplex as a composition of a q-simplex and a p-simplex in some product-like manner, then we might apply Fubini's theorem on the parameter space.\n\nLet me think about the standard (p+q)-simplex Δ^{p+q}. It's the set of points (t_0, t_1, ..., t_{p+q}) with t_i ≥ 0 and Σ t_i = 1. If we want to split this into a q-dimensional front face and a p-dimensional back face, maybe we can use coordinates where the first q+1 coordinates correspond to the front face and the last p+1 coordinates correspond to the back face. However, since the sum of all coordinates is 1, they are not independent, which complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use barycentric coordinates and decompose the integral into two parts. Suppose we fix the sum of the first q+1 coordinates to be s and the sum of the remaining p coordinates to be 1 - s. Then integrating over s from 0 to 1 might allow us to separate the integrals. This approach resembles the way Fubini's theorem works on products, but adjusted for the simplex.\n\nBut I'm not sure how exactly to implement this. Let's consider a simple case where p = q = 1, so we're dealing with a 2-simplex Δ². Let’s parameterize Δ² with coordinates (t₀, t₁, t₂) where t₀ + t₁ + t₂ = 1. If we want to integrate ω ∧ η over Δ², where ω is a 1-form and η is a 1-form, then ω ∧ η is a 2-form. The integral becomes the integral over Δ² of ω ∧ η.\n\nBut the cup product in singular cohomology would take the integral of ω over the front edge [e₀, e₁] and multiply it by the integral of η over the back edge [e₁, e₂]. So we need to see if the integral of ω ∧ η over Δ² equals the product of those two integrals.\n\nLet’s choose specific forms. Suppose ω = f(t) dt₀ + g(t) dt₁ and η = h(t) dt₁ + k(t) dt₂. Then ω ∧ η would involve terms like f h dt₀ ∧ dt₁, f k dt₀ ∧ dt₂, etc. When we integrate over Δ², which is a 2-simplex, we can parameterize it with two variables, say t and s, but I need to make this precise.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using Stokes' theorem. If we can express the integral of the wedge product as a product of integrals over the faces, but Stokes' theorem relates integrals over boundaries to integrals of differentials, so maybe that's not directly helpful here.\n\nWait, another approach: the de Rham map is a chain map from the de Rham complex to the singular cochain complex. If we can show that this chain map is multiplicative with respect to the wedge product and cup product, then it would induce a multiplicative isomorphism on cohomology. However, chain maps don't necessarily preserve products unless they are multiplicative chain maps.\n\nIn other words, we need to check that the de Rham map commutes with the products at the cochain level. But I think this might not be true on the nose, but only up to chain homotopy. However, in cohomology, these homotopies would vanish, leading to the isomorphism preserving the products.\n\nAlternatively, since both products satisfy the same commutativity and compatibility with d, and the de Rham isomorphism is an isomorphism of graded vector spaces, perhaps by uniqueness of such structures, the isomorphism must preserve the products. But I need to verify if such a uniqueness result exists.\n\nI recall that in some contexts, if two cohomology theories have the same properties (functoriality, homotopy invariance, exactness, dimension, etc.), then they are isomorphic as multiplicative theories. But I need to be careful here. The de Rham theorem establishes an isomorphism of vector spaces, but the multiplicative structure requires more.\n\nAlternatively, referring to textbooks, for instance, Bott and Tu's \"Differential Forms in Algebraic Topology\" discusses the de Rham isomorphism and its compatibility with products. They might use a smoothing operator or dual triangulations to relate the cup product and wedge product. \n\nFrom what I remember, the cup product in singular cohomology can be related to the wedge product via the de Rham isomorphism by using the fact that both satisfy the same formal properties, and since the isomorphism is natural, it preserves these products. But the user tried this and failed, so perhaps a more concrete approach is needed.\n\nGoing back to the integral expression. Suppose we have a smooth singular (p+q)-simplex σ: Δ^{p+q} → M. We need to show that ∫_{σ} ω ∧ η = ∫_{σ|_{[e₀,...,e_q]}} ω · ∫_{σ|_{[e_q,...,e_{q+p}]}} η.\n\nIf we can parameterize the simplex such that the front q-face and back p-face are independent in some coordinates, maybe we can split the integral. Let's consider pulling back the forms via σ. Let σ*ω be a q-form on Δ^{p+q}, and σ*η be a p-form. The wedge product σ*(ω ∧ η) = σ*ω ∧ σ*η.\n\nNow, integrating σ*ω ∧ σ*η over Δ^{p+q}. If we can express this integral as the product of the integrals over the front and back faces, then we're done. But how?\n\nWait, maybe using the fact that the standard simplex can be decomposed into a product of simplices up to chain homotopy. The Alexander-Whitney map provides a chain map from the tensor product of the singular chain complexes to the singular chain complex of the product space. But we need the diagonal map Δ: X → X × X, which sends a simplex to (σ, σ). The Alexander-Whitney map approximates this diagonal at the chain level.\n\nIn particular, the Alexander-Whitney map sends a simplex σ to the sum of front faces ⊗ back faces. Then the cup product is induced by composing with the Alexander-Whitney map and then the cochain cross product. So, maybe in the de Rham complex, the wedge product corresponds to this under the isomorphism.\n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of cochain maps. The de Rham map sends a differential form ω to the cochain that integrates ω over smooth simplices. If we can show that this cochain map sends wedge products to cup products, then we are done. This would require showing that for any smooth simplex σ, ∫_σ ω ∧ η = (∫_{front} ω)(∫_{back} η).\n\nBut how to prove this identity? Let's take coordinates on the standard simplex. Let's parameterize Δ^{p+q} as the set of points (t₀, ..., t_{p+q}) with t_i ≥ 0 and Σ t_i = 1. The front q-face is where t_{q+1} = ... = t_{p+q} = 0, and the back p-face is where t₀ = ... = t_{q} = 0.\n\nNow, express ω as a q-form and η as a p-form. When we pull them back to Δ^{p+q}, σ*ω is a q-form that can only involve dt₀, ..., dt_q (since the front face is parameterized by t₀, ..., t_q), and similarly σ*η is a p-form involving dt_q, ..., dt_{p+q} (but since the back face is parameterized by t_q, ..., t_{p+q}, but note that t_q is shared). However, due to the simplex constraints, the coordinates are dependent.\n\nWait, perhaps we can use a coordinate transformation to separate the variables. Let's define new coordinates. For the front q-face, consider variables u₀, ..., u_q with u₀ + ... + u_q = s, and for the back p-face, variables v_0, ..., v_p with v_0 + ... + v_p = 1 - s, where s is a parameter between 0 and 1. Then the entire simplex can be parameterized by s, u₀, ..., u_q, v₀, ..., v_p, but this might be redundant.\n\nAlternatively, think of the simplex as a family of q-simplices scaled by s and p-simplices scaled by 1 - s, as s varies from 0 to 1. This is similar to a cone construction. If we can express the integral over the (p+q)-simplex as an integral over s from 0 to 1, multiplied by integrals over the q and p simplices, then Fubini's theorem would apply.\n\nHowever, I need to make this more precise. Suppose we parameterize the (p+q)-simplex Δ^{p+q} as follows. Let s = t₀ + ... + t_q (the sum over the front face variables), and then normalize the front face coordinates to u_i = t_i / s for i = 0, ..., q, and the back face coordinates to v_j = t_{q+j} / (1 - s) for j = 0, ..., p. Then, when s varies from 0 to 1, and u_i, v_j are in their respective simplices.\n\nIn this parameterization, the (p+q)-simplex is parameterized by s ∈ [0,1], u ∈ Δ^q, and v ∈ Δ^p, with the constraint that Σ t_i = s Σ u_i + (1 - s) Σ v_j = s + (1 - s) = 1. Wait, but u_i and v_j are normalized, so Σ u_i = 1 and Σ v_j = 1. Therefore, this parameterization introduces a scaling by s and (1 - s) on the front and back faces, respectively.\n\nUnder this change of variables, the integral of ω ∧ η over Δ^{p+q} becomes an integral over s, u, and v. However, ω is a q-form and η is a p-form. If we can express ω in terms of the u coordinates and η in terms of the v coordinates, then their wedge product would involve the ds term as well. But I'm not sure how this would factor into the product of the integrals over the front and back faces.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this approach is overcomplicating it. If we use the fact that both the wedge product and cup product are graded commutative and compatible with the differentials, and since the de Rham isomorphism is the only natural isomorphism between these cohomologies, it must preserve the products. This is more of a categorical argument, but the user might be looking for a more direct proof.\n\nAnother idea: use induction on the degree of the forms. For example, start with 0-forms and show that the cup product corresponds to the wedge product (which is just multiplication of functions). Then assume it holds for forms of degree less than p+q and use some decomposition.\n\nAlternatively, consider the case when the forms are closed and use the Künneth formula. The Künneth formula relates the cohomology of a product space to the tensor product of the cohomologies, and both de Rham and singular cohomology satisfy this. But again, since we're not on a product space, this might not directly apply.\n\nWait, going back to the original question, the problem is to show that I(ω ∧ η) = I(ω) ∪ I(η). Since I is an isomorphism, and both sides are homomorphisms from H_{dR}^p × H_{dR}^q to H_{sing}^{p+q}, maybe we can use the uniqueness of such pairings. If both sides satisfy the same properties and agree on a set of generators, then they must be equal.\n\nFor example, if M is a manifold, we can take it to be a product of spheres or tori, where the cohomology is generated by wedge products of forms that correspond to cup products in singular cohomology. If we can show the equality for generators, then it would hold generally.\n\nAlternatively, consider using partitions of unity to localize the problem to coordinate charts where forms split into products, and then use Fubini's theorem there. Since differential forms can be written locally as sums of wedge products of functions times basic forms, maybe locally the integral splits and then patches together globally.\n\nBut the user specifically mentioned the standard simplex, so maybe the key is to work on the standard simplex and use a specific decomposition or coordinate system there. Let's think of the standard (p+q)-simplex Δ^{p+q} as a geometric object. If we can find a smooth map that retracts Δ^{p+q} onto the front q-face and back p-face in a way compatible with the product structure, then perhaps we can decompose the integral.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that the cup product is dual to the intersection product in homology, and the wedge product corresponds to the intersection under Poincaré duality. But the user is working with cohomology, not homology, so this might not directly help.\n\nWait, here's a different approach inspired by the Hodge theorem. If we use harmonic forms, which represent cohomology classes uniquely, then the wedge product of harmonic forms corresponds to the cup product. But this requires a Riemannian metric and might not hold in general, plus it's an overcomplication.\n\nAlternatively, think of both cohomology theories as functors to the category of graded rings. If the de Rham isomorphism is a natural transformation of functors to graded vector spaces, but we need it to be a natural transformation of functors to graded rings. This would require that I preserves the product structure.\n\nBut to confirm this, we need to verify it at the cochain level. Since the cup product in singular cohomology is defined at the cochain level, and the wedge product is defined at the de Rham cochain level, we need to check that the de Rham map intertwines these products.\n\nHowever, cochains in de Rham are differential forms, and in singular they are functions on simplices. The de Rham map sends a form ω to the cochain that integrates ω over smooth simplices. So, to show that this map preserves products, we need:\n\nI(ω ∧ η)(σ) = I(ω) ∪ I(η)(σ)\n\nWhich is exactly the equation the user wants to prove:\n\n∫_σ ω ∧ η = ∫_{σ|_{front}} ω · ∫_{σ|_{back}} η\n\nThis is the core identity. If this holds for all simplices σ, then the de Rham map is a ring homomorphism.\n\nTo prove this identity, perhaps we can use the fact that both sides are linear and multiplicative, and check it on a generating set of forms. For example, take ω and η to be forms that are pullbacks of coordinate functions under some maps that split the simplex into front and back parts.\n\nSuppose we have coordinates x_1, ..., x_{p+q} on Δ^{p+q}. If we can express ω as a q-form involving dx_1 ... dx_q and η as a p-form involving dx_{q+1} ... dx_{p+q}, then their wedge product would be a top form, and integrating over the simplex would factor into the product of the integrals over the front and back faces. However, the problem is that the simplex is not a product, so such a splitting isn't straightforward.\n\nBut maybe by choosing appropriate coordinates, we can achieve this. Let's parameterize the simplex Δ^{p+q} as follows. Let’s denote the vertices as e_0, e_1, ..., e_{p+q}. The front q-face is spanned by e_0, ..., e_q, and the back p-face is spanned by e_q, ..., e_{p+q}.\n\nConsider barycentric coordinates on Δ^{p+q}: each point is a convex combination of the vertices. Any point can be written as Σ_{i=0}^{p+q} t_i e_i, where t_i ≥ 0 and Σ t_i = 1.\n\nNow, split the coordinates into two parts: let s = t_0 + ... + t_q (the sum over the front face) and 1 - s = t_{q} + ... + t_{p+q} (the sum over the back face). However, note that t_q is included in both sums, which complicates things. Wait, actually, in the front q-face, t_{q+1} to t_{p+q} are zero, and in the back p-face, t_0 to t_{q-1} are zero. But in the middle, t_q is shared.\n\nThis overlapping coordinate t_q makes it tricky to split the integral cleanly. Maybe instead, we need to adjust the parameterization to separate the two parts. Suppose we define new variables u_0, ..., u_q such that u_i = t_i / s for i = 0, ..., q (with s ≠ 0), and v_0, ..., v_p such that v_j = t_{q+j} / (1 - s) for j = 0, ..., p (with s ≠ 1). Then, when we express the integral in terms of u_i, v_j, and s, we might be able to factor it.\n\nHowever, the Jacobian of this coordinate transformation would introduce a factor involving s and (1 - s), which might prevent the integral from splitting into a product. Let's attempt to compute this.\n\nThe standard simplex Δ^{p+q} has coordinates t_0, ..., t_{p+q} with Σ t_i = 1. Let’s define s = t_0 + ... + t_q, so 1 - s = t_{q+1} + ... + t_{p+q}. Then, define u_i = t_i / s for i = 0, ..., q and v_j = t_{q+j} / (1 - s) for j = 1, ..., p (assuming we adjust indices appropriately). However, this leaves t_q as part of both the front and back faces, which complicates matters.\n\nAlternatively, consider that in the cup product, the back p-face starts at e_q, so maybe we can adjust the parameterization to separate the coordinates at t_q. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother angle: the problem might be resolved by using the properties of the de Rham isomorphism and the universal coefficient theorem. Since both the wedge product and cup product are compatible with the cohomology functor's structure, and the de Rham isomorphism is natural, it must preserve the products. But I need to back this up with a more concrete argument.\n\nAlternatively, refer to known results. For example, in Bott and Tu's book, it's stated that the de Rham isomorphism is compatible with the cup products. The proof usually involves checking that the isomorphism sends the wedge product to the cup product by using acyclic models or another cochain-level argument.\n\nIn the end, the key idea is that the de Rham cohomology and singular cohomology are both examples of cohomology theories that satisfy the Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms, and the de Rham isomorphism is a natural equivalence. Since the cup product is uniquely determined by the axioms and the wedge product satisfies the same properties, the isomorphism must preserve the products. However, this is quite abstract and the user might be looking for a more hands-on proof using integrals.\n\nGiven that the user tried a Fubini approach and failed, I think the correct answer involves recognizing that while the simplex isn't a product, the cochain-level cup product is defined using the front and back faces, and by the properties of the de Rham isomorphism as a chain map that commutes with the products, the isomorphism must preserve the products. Therefore, the equality holds because both operations are compatible with the cohomology structure and the isomorphism is natural.\n\nBut to structure this as per the required format, the assumptions and problem need to be extracted from the original question. The original question asks if the two products are the same up to isomorphism, specifically whether I(ω ∧ η) = I(ω) ∪ I(η).\n\nAssumptions from the problem:\n1. M is a smooth manifold.\n2. The map I: H_{dR}^p(M) → H_{sing}^p(M, ℝ) is an isomorphism (by de Rham's theorem).\n3. The cup product ∪ is defined on singular cohomology as given.\n4. The wedge product ∧ is defined on de Rham cohomology.\n5. The question assumes the two products have the same commutativity and behavior with respect to d.\n\nThe problem is to prove that I(ω ∧ η) = I(ω) ∪ I(η) for all ω, η.\n\nBut according to the example provided, the assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nM is a smooth manifold,\nI: H_{dR}^p(M) → H_{sing}^p(M, ℝ) is an isomorphism,\n∪ is the cup product on H_{sing}^*(M, ℝ),\n∧ is the wedge product on H_{dR}^*(M),\nω ∈ H_{dR}^q(M),\nη ∈ H_{dR}^p(M),\nσ^{p+q} is a smooth singular (p+q)-simplex.\n\nProblem:\nProve that I(ω ∧ η) = I(ω) ∪ I(η), i.e., that ∫_{σ^{p+q}} ω ∧ η = ∫_{σ|_{[e_0,...,e_q]}} ω · ∫_{σ|_{[e_q,...,e_{q+p}]}} η.\n\nBut in the original question, the user is asking whether the two products agree up to isomorphism, and specifically trying to prove that integral equality. So structuring this properly:\n\nAssumptions should include the conditions on M, the isomorphism I, the definitions of the products, and the properties of the forms and simplices involved.",
