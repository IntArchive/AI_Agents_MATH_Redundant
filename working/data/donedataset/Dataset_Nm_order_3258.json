    "Content": "Let $f:\\mathbb R^n\\to \\mathbb R$. $f$ is continuous, The graph of $f$ if connected in $\\mathbb R^{n+1}$ We define \"connected\" to be cannot be separated by 2 disjoint non-empty open set. My thinking is that continuous is stronger. Because $f(x) = sin(1/x)$ when $x\\neq 0$ and $f(0)=0$ is connected but not continuous. How to prove the continuous implies connected?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You're right. a) If $f:\\mathbb{R}^n\\longrightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ is continuous, then the graph of $f$ is path connected, whence connected ( see here , for instance). Proof: if $(x,f(x))$ and $(y,f(y))$ are two points on the graph, then \n$$\nt\\longmapsto ((1-t)x+ty,f((1-t)x+ty))\n$$\nis a continuous path connecting them within the graph. QED. b) Your example is great. This graph is connected and the function is yet discontinuous. Note: I should add that in general, if $f:C\\longrightarrow X$ is continuous, and if $C$ is connected, then the graph of $f$ is connected in $C \\times X$ as the continuous image of $C$ under $x\\longmapsto (x,f(x))$. This is because continuity preserves connectedness.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So the user is asking about the relationship between connectedness and continuity for a function f: R^n → R. Specifically, they want to prove that if f is continuous, then its graph is connected in R^{n+1}. They also mention an example of a function (the topologist's sine curve) which has a connected graph but isn't continuous, suggesting that continuity is a stronger condition. \n\nFirst, I need to recall some definitions. A space is connected if it cannot be divided into two non-empty disjoint open sets. The graph of a function f is the set of points (x, f(x)) in R^{n+1} where x is in R^n. \n\nThe user's example is f(x) = sin(1/x) for x ≠ 0 and f(0) = 0. The graph of this function is connected because even though the function isn't continuous at 0, the closure of the graph includes the line segment from (0,0) to the oscillating part near x=0. So the graph as a whole is connected, but the function isn't continuous. This shows that connectedness of the graph doesn't imply continuity of the function. But the question is about the converse: if the function is continuous, does that imply the graph is connected?\n\nTo prove that continuity implies connectedness of the graph, I should think about properties of continuous functions and connected spaces. R^n is a connected space because it's path-connected. If f is continuous, then the graph of f should be the image of R^n under a continuous function. Since continuous images of connected spaces are connected, that would do it.\n\nWait, let's unpack that. The graph of f is the set {(x, f(x)) | x ∈ R^n}. We can define a function g: R^n → R^{n+1} by g(x) = (x, f(x)). Since f is continuous, g is also continuous (because each component function is continuous). The image of g is the graph of f. Since R^n is connected and g is continuous, the image must be connected. Therefore, the graph of f is connected.\n\nBut let me check if there's any missing step here. R^n is indeed connected, right? Yes, because it's convex, hence path-connected, hence connected. The function g is continuous as the product of continuous functions (the identity function x ↦ x and f). Therefore, the image of a connected space under a continuous function is connected. That should be the proof.\n\nBut maybe the user is expecting a more detailed proof. Let me structure it step by step. First, note that the domain R^n is connected. Then, construct the function g that maps x to (x, f(x)). Since f is continuous, g is continuous. The graph is exactly g(R^n). Since the continuous image of a connected set is connected, the graph is connected. That seems solid.\n\nAlternatively, one might approach it by contradiction. Suppose the graph is disconnected. Then there exist two open sets U and V in R^{n+1} that separate the graph. But since the projection map π: graph(f) → R^n is continuous and surjective, if the graph were disconnected, R^n would be disconnected, which it isn't. Wait, but the projection map is continuous and open? Hmm, maybe that's another way, but the first approach seems more straightforward.\n\nI think the key point is using the fact that continuous images of connected spaces are connected. So the main assumptions here are that f is continuous, R^n is connected, and the graph is the image of R^n under a continuous map. Therefore, the problem reduces to applying this theorem.",
