    "AcceptedAnswer": "Okay, I'm going to do this the \"special functions and pray\" way: the first thing to do is produce a simpler integral; the one I'm going to deal with is\n$$ I(a,s) = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{x^{s-1}}{1+x^2} \\arctan{\\sqrt{a} x} \\, dx. $$\n(Another option is using $\\arctan{(a+x)}$, but that looked even worse when I tried it.) Now, the required integral is\n$$ \\left. \\frac{\\partial^4}{\\partial s^4} (I(1,s)+I(1,s+1)) \\right|_{s=1/2} \\tag{1}; $$\nstore that away and concentrate on $I$. Now, I don't know about you, but I'm still not convinced I know how to do $I$ directly, so begin with $\\partial I/\\partial a$, which is\n$$ \\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial a} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{a}}\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{x^{s-1}}{1+x^2} \\frac{x}{1+a x^2} \\, dx; $$\nthis one we can do using partial fractions or contour integration, for example, in the usual way, giving\n$$ \\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial a} = \\frac{\\pi}{4\\sqrt{a}} \\frac{1-a^{(1-s)/2}}{1-a} \\sec{\\tfrac{1}{2}\\pi s}. \\tag{2} $$\nAt this point we see there's going to be trouble at $ a=1 $. So now we need to compute $I(1,s)$; it is apparent that $I(0,s)=0$, so we can compute $ I(1,s) = \\int_0^1 \\frac{\\partial I(a,s)}{\\partial a} \\, da $. At this point it would be reasonable to worry: the function we have to integrate is, well, a bit weird. Therefore it is at this point that special functions enter the fray: one definition of the digamma function is:\n$$ \\psi(\\alpha+1) = -\\gamma + \\int_0^1 \\frac{1-y^{\\alpha}}{1-y} \\, dy. $$\nThis isn't quite what we've got, but we can write\n$$ \\frac{1-a^{(1-s)/2}}{(1-a)a^{1/2}} = \\frac{1-a^{1/2}}{(1-a)a^{1/2}} + \\frac{1-a^{-s/2}}{1-a} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}(1+\\sqrt{a})} + \\frac{1-a^{-s/2}}{1-a}. $$\nThe second of these obviously gives our digamma, and the first integrates to $\\log{4}$ by elementary means. Therefore we have made it as far as\n$$ I(1,s) = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\left( \\gamma + \\log{4} + \\psi\\left(1-\\tfrac{1}{2}s\\right) \\right)\\sec{\\tfrac{1}{2}\\pi s}, $$\nand now we just have to take the four derivatives and evaluate them. Thankfully at this point another trick suggests itself: $I(1,s)+I(1,2-s)$ has the same $0,2,4,\\dotsc$th derivatives at $s=1/2$ as $I(1,s)+I(1,1+s)$. Therefore we can take this sum:\n$$ \\begin{align*}\nI(1,s)+I(1,2-s) &= \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\left( \\gamma + \\log{4} + \\psi\\left(1-\\tfrac{1}{2}s\\right) \\right)\\sec{\\tfrac{1}{2}\\pi s} + \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\left( \\gamma + \\log{4} + \\psi\\left(1-\\tfrac{1}{2}(2-s)\\right) \\right)\\sec{\\tfrac{1}{2}\\pi(2- s)} \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\left( \\psi\\left(1-\\tfrac{1}{2}s\\right) - \\psi\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2}s\\right) \\right) \\sec{\\tfrac{1}{2}\\pi s} \\\\\n&=\\frac{\\pi^2}{4} \\csc{\\tfrac{1}{2}\\pi s},\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nusing the reflection formula . It is now straightforward to find fourth derivative at $s=1/2$; it is indeed\n$$ \\left. \\frac{\\partial^4}{\\partial s^4} (I(1,s)+I(1,s+1)) \\right|_{s=1/2} = \\frac{57\\pi^6\\sqrt{2}}{64}. $$ Edited to add: I didn't actually have to get my digamma on (I just felt like evaluating $I(1,s)$, in the end). Instead, look at (2), and do the same trick with sending $s \\mapsto 2-s$. Then the sum becomes\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial a} (I(a,s)+I(a,2-s) ) = \\frac{\\pi}{4\\sqrt{a}} \\left( \\frac{1-a^{(1-s)/2}}{1-a} \\sec{\\tfrac{1}{2}\\pi s} + \\frac{1-a^{(s-1)/2}}{1-a} \\sec{\\tfrac{1}{2}\\pi (2-s)} \\right) \\\\\n= \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\frac{a^{s/2-1}-a^{-s/2}}{1-a} \\sec{\\tfrac{1}{2}\\pi s}\n$$\nThe fraction may look a little familiar to some: integrating from $0$ to $1$, we find\n$$ I(a,s)+I(a,2-s) = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\sec{\\tfrac{1}{2}\\pi s} \\int_0^1  \\frac{a^{s/2-1}-a^{-s/2}}{1-a} \\, da. $$\nThe integral is most easily computed by expanding $(1-a)^{-1}$ as a power series and integrating term-by-term, from which we obtain\n$$ \\int_0^1  \\frac{a^{s/2-1}-a^{-s/2}}{1-a} \\, da = \\pi \\cot{\\tfrac{1}{2}\\pi s}, $$\n(see here for a derivation) (You could also change variables on the second term and consider it as a principal value integral), and then proceed as before. (Remarkably, this makes evaluating the integral all-but elementary: we only need the cotangent series and differentiation under the integral sign). Edited again: I think what @Francois Jaclot's answer is getting at is that the function\n$$ \\frac{x^{1/2}+1/x^{1/2}}{x+1/x}(\\log{x})^4 $$\nis invariant under the transformation $x \\mapsto 1/x$, and\n$$ \\arctan{x} + \\arctan{\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}. $$\nThe integration operator $ \\int_1^{\\infty} \\frac{dx}{x} $ maps to $\\int_0^1 \\frac{dx}{x} $.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let's tackle this integral problem. The user wants to prove that the integral from 0 to infinity of (1+x) arctan(x) times log^4(x) divided by sqrt(x)(1+x^2) dx equals 57π^6√2/64. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the problem correctly. The integral is ∫₀^∞ [ (1+x) arctan(x) log⁴(x) ] / [ sqrt(x) (1+x²) ] dx. The user mentioned they found it using numerical methods and believe the result is correct. The challenge is to prove it analytically.\n\nLooking at the structure of the integral, there are several components: arctan(x), log^4(x), and rational functions. The presence of arctan(x) suggests that maybe substitution involving inverse trigonometric functions or differentiation under the integral sign might be useful. The log^4(x) term hints that differentiating a simpler integral multiple times with respect to a parameter could generate the log powers. The denominator has sqrt(x)(1+x²), which might relate to beta functions or gamma functions if the integral can be transformed into a standard form.\n\nAnother approach is substitution. Let’s consider substitution to simplify the integrand. For example, let t = x² or t = arctan(x). However, arctan(x) is already present, so substitution t = arctan(x) might complicate things. Alternatively, substitution u = log(x) could convert the integral into a form involving exponentials, but that might not directly help with the arctan term.\n\nAlternatively, considering the limits from 0 to infinity, maybe symmetry or substitution x = 1/t could help. Let’s try x = 1/t. Then dx = -1/t² dt. The limits would switch from infinity to 0, so the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ [ (1 + 1/t) arctan(1/t) log^4(1/t) ] / [ sqrt(1/t) (1 + 1/t²) ] * (1/t²) dt. Simplifying this: arctan(1/t) is (π/2 - arctan(t)) for t > 0. Log^4(1/t) is (-log t)^4 = log^4 t. The denominator becomes sqrt(1/t) = t^(-1/2), and (1 + 1/t²) = (t² + 1)/t². So putting it all together:\n\nNumerator: (1 + 1/t)(π/2 - arctan(t)) log^4 t\nDenominator: t^(-1/2) * (t² + 1)/t²\nMultiply by 1/t² from dx.\n\nSo overall:\n\n[ (1 + 1/t)(π/2 - arctan(t)) log^4 t ] / [ t^(-1/2) (t² +1)/t² ] * (1/t²) dt\n\nSimplify denominator: t^(-1/2) * (t² +1)/t² = t^(-1/2 -2) (t² +1) = t^(-5/2)(t² +1)\n\nSo the entire expression becomes:\n\n(1 + 1/t)(π/2 - arctan(t)) log^4 t * t^(5/2) / (t² +1) * (1/t²) dt\n\nWait, perhaps this substitution complicates things. Let's check step by step:\n\nOriginal integrand: [ (1+x) arctan(x) log^4 x ] / [ sqrt(x) (1+x²) ] dx\n\nSubstitute x = 1/t, so dx = -1/t² dt. Then:\n\n[ (1 + 1/t) arctan(1/t) log^4(1/t) ] / [ sqrt(1/t) (1 + (1/t)^2) ] * (-1/t²) dt\n\nSince x goes from 0 to ∞, t goes from ∞ to 0, so we flip the limits and remove the negative sign:\n\n∫₀^∞ [ (1 + 1/t) (π/2 - arctan t) (log^4 t) ] / [ (1/sqrt(t)) (1 + 1/t²) ] * (1/t²) dt\n\nSimplify denominator: 1/sqrt(t) * (1 + 1/t²) = (1/sqrt(t)) * (t² +1)/t² = (t² +1)/(t^(5/2))\n\nThus, the integrand becomes:\n\n[ (1 + 1/t) (π/2 - arctan t) log^4 t ] * t^(5/2)/(t² +1) * (1/t²) dt\n\nSimplify the terms:\n\n(1 + 1/t) = (t +1)/t\n\nMultiply by t^(5/2)/t² = t^(5/2 - 2) = t^(1/2)\n\nSo overall:\n\n[ (t +1)/t * (π/2 - arctan t) log^4 t ] * t^(1/2)/(t² +1) dt\n\nSimplify (t +1)/t * t^(1/2) = (t +1) t^(-1) t^(1/2) = (t +1) t^(-1/2) = t^(1/2) + t^(-1/2)\n\nThus, the integrand becomes:\n\n[ t^(1/2) + t^(-1/2) ] (π/2 - arctan t) log^4 t / (t² +1) dt\n\nSo the integral after substitution is:\n\n∫₀^∞ [ t^(1/2) + t^(-1/2) ] (π/2 - arctan t) log^4 t / (t² +1) dt\n\nHmm, combining the original integral I and the transformed integral I', maybe adding them could help. Let I be the original integral. Then I = I', so I = [I + I'] / 2. But need to check if that's the case.\n\nWait, but substituting x = 1/t gives another integral which might be related to I. Let’s denote the original integral as I.\n\nAfter substitution, we found that I equals the integral of [ t^(1/2) + t^(-1/2) ] (π/2 - arctan t) log^4 t / (t² +1) dt from 0 to ∞. Let’s write that as:\n\nI = ∫₀^∞ [ t^{1/2} + t^{-1/2} ] (π/2 - arctan t) log^4 t / (t² +1) dt\n\nNow, if we add the original I and this transformed version, we might get something symmetric. Let’s denote the original integrand as f(x), then I = ∫₀^∞ f(x) dx, and after substitution, I = ∫₀^∞ f(1/t) * (1/t²) dt. But here, after substitution, it's transformed into a different expression. Let me see:\n\nOriginal I = ∫₀^∞ [ (1+x) arctan x log^4 x ] / [ sqrt(x)(1+x²) ] dx\n\nTransformed I after x=1/t substitution becomes:\n\n∫₀^∞ [ ( t^{1/2} + t^{-1/2} ) (π/2 - arctan t) log^4 t ] / (1 + t²) dt\n\nSo if we add the original I and the transformed I, we get:\n\nI + I = ∫₀^∞ [ (1+x) arctan x log^4 x / (sqrt(x)(1+x²)) + (x^{1/2} + x^{-1/2}) (π/2 - arctan x) log^4 x / (1 +x²) ] dx\n\nBut this might not simplify directly. Alternatively, maybe subtracting them or combining in another way. Alternatively, consider that arctan x + arctan(1/x) = π/2 for x > 0. So perhaps the sum of the original integrand and the transformed integrand would have (arctan x + (π/2 - arctan x)) = π/2. Let’s check:\n\nOriginal integrand: [ (1+x) arctan x log^4 x ] / [ sqrt(x) (1+x²) ]\n\nTransformed integrand after substitution: [ (x^{1/2} + x^{-1/2}) (π/2 - arctan x) log^4 x ] / (1 +x²)\n\nWait, if we add these two:\n\n[ (1+x) arctan x / sqrt(x) + (x^{1/2} + x^{-1/2})(π/2 - arctan x) ] * log^4 x / (1 +x²)\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\nFirst term: (1+x) arctan x / sqrt(x) = (1/sqrt(x) + x/sqrt(x)) arctan x = (x^{-1/2} + x^{1/2}) arctan x\n\nSecond term: (x^{1/2} + x^{-1/2})(π/2 - arctan x)\n\nSo adding them gives:\n\n(x^{-1/2} + x^{1/2}) [ arctan x + π/2 - arctan x ] = (x^{-1/2} + x^{1/2}) π/2\n\nThus, the sum of the two integrands becomes:\n\n(x^{-1/2} + x^{1/2}) π/2 * log^4 x / (1 +x²)\n\nTherefore, adding I and I (since after substitution I remains the same?), wait no. Wait, if I denote the original integral as I and the transformed integral as I', then I = I', so 2I = I + I' = ∫₀^∞ [ (x^{-1/2} + x^{1/2}) π/2 log^4 x / (1 +x²) ] dx\n\nTherefore, 2I = (π/2) ∫₀^∞ (x^{-1/2} + x^{1/2}) log^4 x / (1 +x²) dx\n\nSo then, I = (π/4) ∫₀^∞ (x^{-1/2} + x^{1/2}) log^4 x / (1 +x²) dx\n\nNow, this integral seems more symmetric. Let’s make substitution t = x². Wait, but maybe another substitution. Let’s consider x = e^u, so that log x = u, and dx = e^u du. However, integrating over x from 0 to ∞ would translate to u from -∞ to ∞. Alternatively, split the integral into two parts: x from 0 to 1 and 1 to ∞, but since we have symmetry, maybe x = tan θ substitution. Wait, the denominator is 1 + x², which is reminiscent of arctan.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the integral ∫₀^∞ x^{s} / (1 +x²) dx is related to beta function. Recall that ∫₀^∞ x^{s}/(1 +x²) dx = (1/2) B( (s+1)/2, (1 - s)/2 ) ) = (π/2) sec( π s / 2 ) when -1 < Re(s) < 1. But here we have x^{±1/2} multiplied by log^4 x. So perhaps differentiating this integral four times with respect to s and then evaluating at s = ±1/2.\n\nYes, that seems promising. Let’s recall that ∫₀^∞ x^s / (1 +x²) dx = π/(2 cos(π s /2 )) for |Re(s)| < 1. Then, if we take the fourth derivative with respect to s, we can get the integral involving log^4 x.\n\nSo let’s denote F(s) = ∫₀^∞ x^s / (1 +x²) dx = π/(2 cos(π s /2 )).\n\nThen, ∫₀^∞ x^s log^4 x / (1 +x²) dx = F^{(4)}(s).\n\nSimilarly, our integral is ∫₀^∞ (x^{-1/2} + x^{1/2}) log^4 x / (1 +x²) dx = F^{(4)}(-1/2) + F^{(4)}(1/2).\n\nSo compute F(s) = π/(2 cos(π s /2 )), so F''''(s) is the fourth derivative of π/(2 cos(π s /2 )).\n\nThus, we need to compute the fourth derivative of π/(2 cos(π s /2 )) evaluated at s = -1/2 and s = 1/2.\n\nBut let's check the validity. The integral F(s) converges for |Re(s)| < 1, so at s = ±1/2, it's on the boundary but still converges. The differentiation under the integral sign should be valid here.\n\nSo, let's compute F(s) = π/(2 cos(π s /2 )). Then, F^{(4)}(s) is the fourth derivative of this function with respect to s. Let’s compute derivatives step by step.\n\nLet’s let f(s) = π/(2 cos(π s /2 )). Let’s compute f’(s):\n\nFirst derivative: f’(s) = π/2 * (π/2) sin(π s /2 ) / cos²(π s /2 ) ) = π²/4 * sin(π s /2 ) / cos²(π s /2 )\n\nAlternatively, more carefully:\n\nd/ds [1/cos(π s /2 )] = (π/2) sin(π s /2 ) / cos²(π s /2 )\n\nThus, f’(s) = π/2 * (π/2) sin(π s /2 ) / cos²(π s /2 ) = π²/(4) * sin(π s /2 ) / cos²(π s /2 )\n\nSimilarly, second derivative f''(s):\n\nDifferentiate f’(s):\n\nLet’s denote u = sin(π s /2 ) / cos²(π s /2 )\n\nThen f’(s) = π²/4 * u\n\ndu/ds = [ (π/2 cos(π s /2 ) * cos²(π s /2 ) - sin(π s /2 ) * 2 cos(π s /2 )*(-π/2 sin(π s /2 )) ] / cos^4(π s /2 )\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\nFirst term: (π/2 cos(π s /2 ) * cos²(π s /2 ) = (π/2) cos^3(π s /2 )\n\nSecond term: - sin(π s /2 ) * 2 cos(π s /2 )*(-π/2 sin(π s /2 )) = 2 * π/2 sin²(π s /2 ) cos(π s /2 ) = π sin²(π s /2 ) cos(π s /2 )\n\nThus, numerator = (π/2) cos^3(π s /2 ) + π sin²(π s /2 ) cos(π s /2 )\n\nFactor out π cos(π s /2 )/2:\n\nπ cos(π s /2 )/2 [ cos²(π s /2 ) + 2 sin²(π s /2 ) ]\n\nBut cos² + 2 sin² = 1 + sin². Hmm, perhaps better to keep as is.\n\nThus, du/ds = [ π cos(π s /2 )/2 ( cos²(π s /2 ) + 2 sin²(π s /2 ) ) ] / cos^4(π s /2 )\n\n= π / (2 cos^3(π s /2 )) [ cos²(π s /2 ) + 2 sin²(π s /2 ) ]\n\nTherefore, f''(s) = π²/4 * du/ds = π²/4 * [ π / (2 cos^3(π s /2 )) (cos² + 2 sin²) ) ]\n\n= π^3 / (8 cos^3(π s /2 )) (cos²(π s /2 ) + 2 sin²(π s /2 )) )\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better way to compute the fourth derivative. Alternatively, use the series expansion of 1/cos(z) which is the generating function for Euler numbers.\n\nRecall that 1/cos(z) = ∑_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n E_{2n} z^{2n}/(2n)! ), where E_{2n} are Euler numbers. But maybe using complex analysis or generating functions could help here.\n\nAlternatively, note that the function F(s) = π/(2 cos(π s /2 )) can be related to the beta function or other special functions, but differentiation might still be necessary.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that the fourth derivative of 1/cos(z) can be expressed in terms of derivatives of tan(z), since 1/cos(z) = sec(z), and derivatives of sec(z) are known to involve sec(z) and tan(z). However, we need the fourth derivative with respect to s, where z = π s /2. So let’s use chain rule.\n\nLet’s denote z = π s /2, so F(s) = π/(2 cos z )\n\nThen, derivatives with respect to s involve derivatives with respect to z multiplied by (π/2)^n for the nth derivative.\n\nFirst derivative: dF/ds = (π/2) * d/dz [ π/(2 cos z ) ] = (π/2) * [ π/(2) * sin z / cos² z ) ] = π²/4 * sin z / cos² z\n\nSecond derivative: d²F/ds² = (π/2)^2 * d/dz [ sin z / cos² z ]\n\nLet’s compute d/dz [ sin z / cos² z ] = [ cos z * cos² z - sin z * 2 cos z (-sin z ) ] / cos^4 z\n\nWait, more carefully:\n\nLet’s compute derivative of sin z / cos² z:\n\n= [ cos z * cos² z + sin z * 2 cos z sin z ] / cos^4 z\n\nWait, let me use quotient rule: numerator derivative is cos z * cos² z - sin z * (-2 cos z sin z )\n\nWait, no. Quotient rule: derivative of numerator (sin z) is cos z, derivative of denominator (cos² z) is -2 cos z sin z. So:\n\nd/dz [ sin z / cos² z ] = [ cos z * cos² z - sin z * (-2 cos z sin z ) ] / cos^4 z\n\n= [ cos^3 z + 2 sin² z cos z ] / cos^4 z\n\n= [ cos² z + 2 sin² z ] / cos^3 z\n\n= [1 + sin² z ] / cos^3 z\n\nTherefore, second derivative:\n\nd²F/ds² = (π/2)^2 * [1 + sin² z ] / cos^3 z * π²/4 * ... wait, let's track the constants.\n\nWait, first derivative: dF/ds = (π/2) * derivative of F w.r. to z. So:\n\nFirst derivative: dF/ds = (π/2) * (π/2 sin z / cos² z ) = π²/(4) sin z / cos² z\n\nSecond derivative: d²F/ds² = (π/2) * d/dz [ π²/4 sin z / cos² z ]\n\n= (π/2)(π²/4) * d/dz [ sin z / cos² z ] \n\n= π^3 /8 * [ cos^3 z + 2 sin² z cos z ] / cos^4 z \n\n= π^3 /8 * [ cos² z + 2 sin² z ] / cos^3 z\n\n= π^3 /8 * [1 + sin² z ] / cos^3 z\n\nSimilarly, third derivative would involve differentiating this expression, which is getting more complicated. \n\nThis approach seems too tedious. Maybe there's a smarter way. Recall that the integral involving x^s log^n x can be handled by differentiating the Mellin transform n times with respect to s. Since we have log^4 x, we need the fourth derivative.\n\nGiven F(s) = ∫₀^∞ x^s / (1 +x²) dx = π/(2 cos(π s /2 ))\n\nThen, ∫₀^∞ x^s log^4 x / (1 +x²) dx = d^4/ds^4 F(s) = F^{(4)}(s)\n\nTherefore, our integral I = (π/4)[ F^{(4)}(-1/2) + F^{(4)}(1/2) ]\n\nSo we need to compute F^{(4)}(s) at s = -1/2 and s =1/2.\n\nTo compute F^{(4)}(s), we can use the fact that F(s) = π/(2 cos(π s /2 )) and take derivatives.\n\nAlternatively, use the series expansion of F(s) around s = ±1/2. But this might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, note that cos(π s /2 ) can be expressed in terms of trigonometric identities. For example, at s =1/2, cos(π/4) = √2/2, and at s = -1/2, cos(-π/4) = √2/2 as well. However, the derivatives will involve higher-order terms.\n\nAlternatively, consider using the Taylor series expansion of 1/cos(z) around z = π/4 (for s=1/2: z=π/4) and z=-π/4 (for s=-1/2). But this might not be the easiest path.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that the derivatives of sec(z) are known. The nth derivative of sec(z) can be expressed in terms of sec(z) and tan(z). However, for the fourth derivative, it's manageable.\n\nLet’s denote z = π s /2. Then F(s) = π/(2 cos z )\n\nSo F(s) = (π/2) sec z\n\nFirst derivative: F’(s) = (π/2) * sec z tan z * dz/ds = (π/2) * sec z tan z * (π/2) = π²/4 sec z tan z\n\nSecond derivative: F''(s) = d/ds [ π²/4 sec z tan z ] = π²/4 * [ sec z tan z * tan z * (π/2) + sec z (sec² z) * (π/2) ] \n\n= π²/4 * (π/2) [ sec z tan² z + sec³ z ]\n\n= π³/8 sec z (tan² z + sec² z )\n\nBut tan² z +1 = sec² z, so tan² z + sec² z = sec² z + tan² z = sec² z + (sec² z -1 ) = 2 sec² z -1\n\nWait, no: tan² z = sec² z -1, so tan² z + sec² z = sec² z -1 + sec² z = 2 sec² z -1.\n\nThus, F''(s) = π³/8 sec z (2 sec² z -1 )\n\nThird derivative: Differentiate F''(s):\n\nF''(s) = π³/8 sec z (2 sec² z -1 )\n\nSo F'''(s) = π³/8 [ d/dz (sec z (2 sec² z -1 )) * dz/ds ]\n\nFirst, compute derivative inside:\n\nd/dz [ sec z (2 sec² z -1 ) ] = sec z tan z (2 sec² z -1 ) + sec z (4 sec² z tan z )\n\n= sec z tan z [ 2 sec² z -1 + 4 sec² z ]\n\n= sec z tan z [ 6 sec² z -1 ]\n\nThus, F'''(s) = π³/8 * sec z tan z (6 sec² z -1 ) * (π/2 )\n\n= π^4 /16 sec z tan z (6 sec² z -1 )\n\nFourth derivative: F''''(s) = d/ds [ F'''(s) ]\n\n= π^4 /16 [ d/dz (sec z tan z (6 sec² z -1 )) * dz/ds ]\n\nFirst, compute derivative inside:\n\nLet’s denote u = sec z tan z (6 sec² z -1 )\n\nCompute du/dz:\n\nUse product rule. Let’s break it into parts:\n\nLet’s let u = sec z tan z * (6 sec² z -1 )\n\nFirst, derivative of sec z tan z:\n\nd/dz (sec z tan z ) = sec z tan z tan z + sec z sec² z = sec z tan² z + sec³ z\n\nThen, derivative of (6 sec² z -1 ) is 12 sec² z tan z\n\nThus, using product rule:\n\ndu/dz = [ sec z tan² z + sec³ z ] * (6 sec² z -1 ) + sec z tan z * 12 sec² z tan z \n\n= (6 sec² z -1 )(sec z tan² z + sec³ z ) + 12 sec^3 z tan² z \n\nExpand the first term:\n\n= 6 sec² z * sec z tan² z + 6 sec² z * sec³ z - sec z tan² z - sec³ z +12 sec^3 z tan² z\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst term: 6 sec^3 z tan² z\n\nSecond term: 6 sec^5 z\n\nThird term: - sec z tan² z\n\nFourth term: - sec^3 z\n\nFifth term:12 sec^3 z tan² z\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nsec^3 z tan² z: 6 +12 = 18\n\nsec^5 z:6\n\n-sec z tan² z: -1\n\n-sec^3 z: -1\n\nThus:\n\n= 18 sec^3 z tan² z +6 sec^5 z - sec z tan² z - sec^3 z\n\nFactor where possible:\n\n= sec z tan² z (18 sec² z -1 ) + sec^3 z (6 sec² z -1 )\n\nBut this might not help. Alternatively, express tan² z as sec² z -1:\n\n= 18 sec^3 z (sec² z -1 ) +6 sec^5 z - sec z (sec² z -1 ) - sec^3 z\n\nExpand:\n\n=18 sec^5 z -18 sec^3 z +6 sec^5 z - sec^3 z + sec z - sec^3 z\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nsec^5 z:18 +6 =24\n\nsec^3 z: -18 -1 -1 =-20\n\nsec z: +1\n\nThus, du/dz =24 sec^5 z -20 sec^3 z + sec z\n\nTherefore, F''''(s) = π^4 /16 * [24 sec^5 z -20 sec^3 z + sec z ] * (π/2 )\n\n= π^5 /32 [24 sec^5 z -20 sec^3 z + sec z ]\n\nNow, evaluate F''''(s) at s=1/2 and s=-1/2.\n\nFor s=1/2, z=π*(1/2)/2=π/4. Similarly, s=-1/2 gives z=-π/4. But since sec is even, sec(-π/4)=sec(π/4)=√2.\n\nCompute sec(π/4)=√2, so sec z=√2, sec^3 z=(√2)^3=2^(3/2)=2.828..., sec^5 z=2^(5/2)=5.656...\n\nCompute for z=π/4:\n\nsec z = √2\n\nsec^3 z = (√2)^3 = 2^(3/2)\n\nsec^5 z = (√2)^5 = 2^(5/2)\n\nSo plug into F''''(s=1/2):\n\nF''''(1/2) = π^5 /32 [24 *2^(5/2) -20 *2^(3/2) + √2 ]\n\nFactor out √2:\n\n= π^5 /32 *√2 [24 *2^2 -20 *2^1 +1 ]\n\n= π^5 /32 *√2 [24*4 -20*2 +1 ]\n\n= π^5 /32 *√2 [96 -40 +1 ] = π^5 /32 *√2 *57\n\nSimilarly, for s=-1/2, z=-π/4, but since sec is even, the result is the same. Therefore, F''''(-1/2)=F''''(1/2)=π^5 /32 *√2 *57\n\nThus, the integral I = (π/4)[ F''''(-1/2) + F''''(1/2) ] = (π/4)(2 * π^5 /32 *√2 *57 ) = (π/4)( π^5 √2 *57 /16 ) = π^6 √2 *57 / (64 )\n\nHence, I = 57 π^6 √2 /64, which matches the given result. Therefore, the proof is complete by transforming the integral, using substitution, exploiting symmetry, differentiating under the integral sign, and computing the required derivatives of the secant function.",
