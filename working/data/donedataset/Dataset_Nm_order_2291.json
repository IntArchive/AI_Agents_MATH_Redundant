    "Content": "Show$$\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\left(\\frac{1+\\sin(k)}{2}\\right)^k$$diverges. Just going down the list, the following tests don't work (or I failed at using them correctly) because: $\\lim \\limits_{k\\to\\infty}a_k\\neq0$ — The limit is hard to evaluate. $\\lim \\limits_{k\\to\\infty}\\left|\\dfrac{a_{k+1}}{a_k}\\right|>1$—Limit does not converge; inconclusive. $\\lim \\limits_{k\\to\\infty}\\sqrt[k]{|a_k|}>1$—Limit does not converge; inconclusive. $\\int \\limits_{1}^{\\infty}a_k\\,dk$—How do I even do this. There exists a $|b_k|\\geq|a_k|$ and $\\sum b_k$ converges—Cannot think of any such a $b_k$. $\\lim \\limits_{k\\to\\infty}\\cfrac{a_k}{b_k}$ exists and $\\sum b_k$ converges — Cannot think of any such $b_k$. Can I have some help? EDIT We will show that there is no $\\delta$ or corresponding $\\epsilon$ so that $k>\\delta$ implies$$\\left|\\left(\\frac{1+\\sin(k)}{2}\\right)^k-\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\left(\\frac{1+\\sin(n)}{2}\\right)^n\\right|<\\epsilon$$ Let the first term be denoted $a_k$ and the second $L$ (for limit). Pick the the smaller number of $|a_{\\frac{3\\pi}2}-L|$ or $|a_{\\frac\\pi2}-L|$. Whichever was chosen (denote choice as $\\epsilon$), it is clear that setting $k:=k+\\pi$, which is greater than $\\delta$, will produce a result such that $|a_k-L|\\geq\\epsilon$. Therefore, the limit does not exist, and the sum diverges. EDIT AGAIN The proof above is no good. More help pls. I can't figure this one out.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The trick is to use the classic theorem of Hurwitz on rational approximation of irrationals, that there are infinitely many $m,n$ with $|\\frac\\pi2-\\frac{m}{n}|\\lt\\frac1{n^2}$ (more specifically, you need infinitely many such pairs with $n\\equiv 1\\bmod 4$, but this result is known; see below).  Any such pair will have $|m-\\frac{n\\pi}{2}|\\lt\\frac1n\\lt\\frac2m$; but then $\\sin(\\frac{n\\pi}{2}) = 1$ (this is where the restriction on $n$ comes from), and by quick application of either the addition identity for sin or the mean value theorem, we get $\\sin(m)\\gt1-\\frac2m$ for any such pair.  This means that infinitely often we have $\\frac{1+\\sin(m)}{2}\\gt1-\\frac1m$, and $\\left(\\frac{1+\\sin(m)}{2}\\right)^m\\gt\\left(1-\\frac1m\\right)^m$, and you should be able to bound the RHS of this away from zero.  This means that you've found infinitely many $a_m$ bounded away from zero, and that's enough to show divergence. IMPORTANT CAVEAT: as @robjohn points out in the comments, it's not as easy as I thought at first to get the Hurwitz result in an arbitrary residue class!  The paper \"On The Approximation Of Irrational Numbers With Rationals Restricted By Congruence Relations\" gives the following result: For any irrational number $\\xi$, any $s\\geq 1$, and any integers $a$\n  and $b$, there are infinitely many integers $u,v$ satisfying\n  $\\left|\\xi-\\frac uv\\right|\\lt \\frac{2s^2}{v^2}$ with $u\\equiv a\\pmod s$ and $v\\equiv b\\pmod s$. We can take $\\xi=\\frac\\pi2$, $s=4$, $b=1$ here and get infinitely many $u,v$ with $\\left|\\frac\\pi2-\\frac uv\\right|\\lt\\frac{8}{v^2}$ and $v\\equiv 1\\pmod 4$; this is a factor of 8 away from the result above, but it's still good enough to give infinitely many $m$ with $\\left(\\frac{1+\\sin(m)}{2}\\right)^m\\gt\\left(1-\\frac8m\\right)^m$ and that's good enough to give a bound away from zero and prove divergence.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to show that the series ∑_{k=1}^∞ [(1 + sin(k))/2]^k diverges. First, I need to recall the tests for divergence and convergence of series. The user mentioned several tests they tried, but none worked. Let me think about what's special about this series.\n\nThe general term here is [(1 + sin(k))/2]^k. Since sin(k) oscillates between -1 and 1, the term (1 + sin(k))/2 ranges from 0 to 1. So each term of the series is between 0 and 1 raised to the power k. That means each term is positive and less than or equal to 1. For the series to converge, the terms must approach zero sufficiently fast. However, if the limit of a_k as k approaches infinity isn't zero, the series diverges. The user tried evaluating the limit of a_k but found it hard. Let me check if the limit exists.\n\nIf the limit of a_k as k→∞ exists and is not zero, then the series diverges. But if the limit doesn't exist, the series might still diverge because the terms don't approach zero. The problem here is that sin(k) is periodic but k is an integer, so sin(k) doesn't converge. However, k here is an integer, so sin(k) is evaluated at integer arguments. The values of sin(k) for integer k are dense in [-1,1], which is a known result from equidistribution theory. So, sin(k) gets arbitrarily close to 1 infinitely often. Let's see when sin(k) is close to 1.\n\nWhen sin(k) is close to 1, then (1 + sin(k))/2 is close to 1. So, [(1 + sin(k))/2]^k would be close to 1^k = 1. If this happens infinitely often, then the terms a_k don't approach zero. Wait, but even if sin(k) approaches 1 only at some subsequence, say when k is near π/2 + 2πn, but since k is an integer, we can't have k exactly at those points. However, due to the density, there are integers k where sin(k) is arbitrarily close to 1. So, for those k, (1 + sin(k))/2 is close to 1, so [(1 + sin(k))/2]^k would be approximately (1 - ε)^k, which tends to zero. Hmm, but wait, if sin(k) is approaching 1, then ε is approaching 0. So perhaps even though sin(k) is close to 1, the term (1 + sin(k))/2 is less than 1, so raising it to the k would go to zero. But maybe there's a balance here.\n\nWait, maybe we can find a subsequence where sin(k) is close to 1 often enough that the terms don't decay fast enough. Alternatively, maybe the terms a_k don't approach zero. Let me try to compute the lim sup of a_k. If lim sup a_k > 0, then the series diverges.\n\nSuppose there exists a subsequence k_n where sin(k_n) approaches 1. Then (1 + sin(k_n))/2 approaches 1, so [(1 + sin(k_n))/2]^{k_n} approaches 1^{k_n} = 1. So lim sup a_k = 1. Therefore, the limit of a_k as k→∞ doesn't exist, and since the lim sup is 1, which is not zero, the series diverges by the divergence test. Wait, but the user said that the limit is hard to evaluate. Maybe they didn't consider the lim sup. The key point is that if the lim sup of |a_k| is not zero, then the series diverges. So in this case, since lim sup a_k = 1, which is not zero, the series must diverge. Therefore, the answer is that the series diverges because the necessary condition for convergence (a_k → 0) is not met.\n\nBut the user mentioned in their edit that they tried to show the limit doesn't exist but their proof wasn't good. Let's verify. The user tried to use some delta-epsilon argument but made a mistake. Let me think again. For the limit of a_k to exist, the terms must approach a single value. But because sin(k) is dense in [-1,1], there are infinitely many k where sin(k) is close to 1, making a_k close to 1, and infinitely many k where sin(k) is close to -1, making a_k close to 0. Therefore, the terms a_k oscillate between values near 0 and 1. Hence, the limit does not exist, and the lim sup is 1. Therefore, the series diverges because the terms don't approach zero. In fact, they have a subsequence approaching 1, so the necessary condition for convergence (a_k → 0) is violated.\n\nSo the problem is structured as:\n\nAssumption: The series is ∑_{k=1}^∞ [(1 + sin(k))/2]^k.\nProblem: Show that the series diverges.\n\nBut in the original problem, the user already stated the problem. So the formatted version would have the assumption that the series is as given, and the problem is to show it diverges. However, the example given in the original instruction included specific assumptions about n being integer and divisible by 7. But in this case, the main assumption is that k is a positive integer, which is implied by the summation from k=1 to infinity. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption: k is a positive integer,\nProblem: Show that the series ∑_{k=1}^∞ [(1 + sin(k))/2]^k diverges.\n\nBut wait, maybe more precise. The problem is about the series terms involving sin(k), so the key assumption is that k ranges over positive integers. So the formatted problem would list that assumption. But in the example, the assumption was about n being integer and divisible by 7. So here, the assumption would be that k is a positive integer. Then the problem is to show divergence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another assumption. Let me check the original problem again. The user didn't specify any conditions except the series. So the assumptions would be that the summation is over positive integers k starting at 1, and each term is [(1 + sin(k))/2]^k. So the formatted problem would list:\n\nAssumption: k is a positive integer,\nProblem: Show that ∑_{k=1}^∞ [(1 + sin(k))/2]^k diverges.\n\nBut since the example included specific mathematical conditions (n is integer, n divisible by 7), here the assumption is k is a positive integer, which is necessary for the problem. So yes, that's the main assumption. The problem is to show divergence.",
