    "Content": "This is a problem from Rudin, but I wanted to add my own intuition to it. It uses Rudin's definition of Archimedean property. I'd just like to know if my version holds If $x \\in \\mathbb R$ , $y\\in \\mathbb R$ and $x<y$ , then $\\exists p \\in \\mathbb Q$ such that $x < p < y$ Since $x < y$ , then $y-x>0$ . Applying Archimedean property, we see $\\exists n \\in \\mathbb Z^+$ such that $n(y-x)>1$ . Allow $A=\\{i\\in \\mathbb Z\\mid i > nx\\}$ . Obviously $A$ is bounded by $nx$ , so take $m = \\inf A$ . So we have $m > nx$ and $m-1 \\leq nx$ by set and $\\inf$ definition. This gives us $m-1 \\leq nx < m$ . Combining and rearranging with $n(y-x) > 1$ gives us $nx < m \\leq nx +1 < ny \\implies nx < m < ny$ . Thus $x < \\frac{m}{n} < y$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This proof works, mostly. For completeness: You should mention why $A$ is non-empty. The proof of this uses the Archimedean property. You have shown that $A$ has an infimum, but you haven't shown that the infimum is in $A.$ For lots of sets of real numbers, the infimum is not in the set, so why is $A$ different? Worth being explicit with $nx+1<nx+n(y-x)=ny$. You could re-iterate that $n>0$ which is why you can can divide by $n$ in the last step. But the second thing is the big problem. Why is $m\\in A?$ The key is the result: If $A\\subset \\mathbb Z$ is non-empty with an integer lower bound, then $A$ has a minimum element. That is, $\\inf A \\in A.$ This follows from the well-ordering principal of the positive integers: If $A\\subset \\mathbb Z^+$ is non-empty, then it has a minimal element. We know that our $A$ has a real lower bound, $xi$. So we need to show that there is an integer $k$ such that $k<xi,$ which is then an integer lower bound for $A.$ The integer $k$ can be shown to exist again by the Archimedean property. Find positive integer $K$ so that $-xi<K\\cdot 1$ and then $k=-K.$ So what this proof is showing is how much our intuitions about the real numbers and integers are related to the Archimedean property. It is used here to: Show that $n$ exists. Show that $A$ is non-empty. Show that $A$ has a least element.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. First, I need to read the original question carefully and extract the assumptions and the main problem. The example provided helps me understand how to break down the problem into individual assumptions and then state the problem concisely.\n\nThe original problem is from Math Stack Exchange, titled \"Proof there is a rational between any two reals\". The user wants to prove that for any two real numbers x and y where x < y, there exists a rational number p such that x < p < y. They mention using the Archimedean property as in Rudin's definition.\n\nLooking at the assumptions, the user states that x and y are real numbers with x < y. They apply the Archimedean property to find a positive integer n such that n(y - x) > 1. Then they define set A as integers i where i > nx, take the infimum m of A, and derive inequalities leading to x < m/n < y.\n\nSo the key assumptions here are:\n1. x and y are real numbers.\n2. x is less than y.\n3. The Archimedean property applies to the real numbers (which allows finding such an n that n(y - x) > 1).\n4. The set A is defined as integers greater than nx.\n5. The infimum m of A exists and is an integer.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. So breaking it down:\n\n- The problem involves two real numbers x and y where x < y. So the first assumption is x and y are real numbers. Then another assumption is x < y. These are two separate conditions.\n\n- The Archimedean property is applied here, which in the context of real numbers states that for any real number, there's an integer greater than it. So the assumption here is the Archimedean property holds for real numbers (which it does, but the problem probably assumes this as a given property).\n\nWait, but in the example given, the assumption included that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the original problem. Here, the user is using the Archimedean property as part of their proof steps, but maybe the problem itself doesn't state that as an assumption. The original problem is to prove that between any two reals there's a rational, using the Archimedean property. So perhaps the key assumptions are just the conditions given in the problem statement, not the steps used in the proof.\n\nWait, the example provided in the user's instruction took the original problem which was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem included an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, it was for every integer n, but the example added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal problem example: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems incorrect. Maybe the example is wrong? Wait, perhaps the example is from a different problem where maybe there was a typo. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a condition that n is divisible by 7, but the user's example formatting included that. Hmm, this might be a problem. But perhaps the example is illustrative, and the actual task is to extract the assumptions from the problem as stated, not the solution.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format\". So the task is to take the original question (the problem statement) and extract the assumptions and problem. The example given may have a mistake. Let me check.\n\nIn the example, the original problem is to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the only assumption should be that n is an integer, but the formatted problem added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Perhaps the example is wrong. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instructions, perhaps the example was a mistake, but the main point is to extract the assumptions from the problem as presented, not from the solution steps.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's question is to prove that between any two real numbers x and y with x < y, there exists a rational p such that x < p < y. The problem statement itself doesn't mention the Archimedean property as part of the problem's given conditions, but the user's solution approach uses it. However, the task is to structure the problem, not the solution. Therefore, the assumptions should be the conditions given in the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the problem's assumptions are:\n\n1. x is a real number.\n2. y is a real number.\n3. x < y.\n\nThe problem is to prove there exists a rational number p such that x < p < y.\n\nThe user's solution approach uses the Archimedean property and defines set A, but those are part of the proof steps, not the problem's assumptions. So the formatted problem should include the assumptions from the problem statement, not the proof steps.\n\nBut wait, maybe in some contexts, certain properties like the Archimedean property are considered implicit assumptions. However, in standard real analysis, the Archimedean property is a consequence of the least upper bound property, so it's a theorem, not an assumption. But if the problem is presented in a context where the Archimedean property is taken as given, then maybe it's an assumption. However, the original problem statement doesn't mention needing to assume the Archimedean property; it's part of the proof method. So perhaps the problem's assumptions are only that x and y are real numbers with x < y.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- x is a real number,\n- y is a real number,\n- x is less than y.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a rational number p such that x < p < y.\n\nBut let me check again. The user's original question on Math Stack Exchange says: \"Proof there is a rational between any two reals\" and the problem is: \"If x ∈ R, y ∈ R and x < y, then ∃ p ∈ Q such that x < p < y.\" So that's exactly the problem statement. The user then goes on to present their proof attempt, using the Archimedean property. But in terms of structuring the problem, the assumptions are the hypotheses given in the problem: x and y are real numbers, x < y, and the problem is to find a rational p between them.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have those three assumptions and the problem as stated.",
