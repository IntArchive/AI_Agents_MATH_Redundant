    "Content": "I've been asked to prove multi-dimensional Mean Value Theorem. I'd be\n  grateful if someone could give me feedback if it is okay. Proof of Mean Value Theorem: Let $f: [a,b]\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ be a continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$. Consider the function: $$g(x)=f(x)-f(a)-\\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}(x-a) \\mbox{.}$$ This function is continuous on $[a,b]$, differentiable on $(a,b)$ and $g(a)=g(b)$. Thus there is $c\\in (a,b)$ such that $g'(c)=0$. But this means that there is $c\\in (a,b)$ such that $$f'(c)=\\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}\\mbox{.}$$ Proof of multi-dimensional Mean Value Theorem: Let $f:U\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ be a differentiable function ($U$ is an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^n)$. Let $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ be points in $U$ such that the entire line segment between them is contained in $U$. Define $h:[0,1]\\rightarrow U$ in the following way: $$h(t)=(a_1+(b_1-a_1)t,\\ldots,a_n+(b_n-a_n)t) \\mbox{.}$$ This function is differentiable on $(0,1)$ and continuous on $[0,1]$, so is $f \\circ h$. If we apply Mean Value Theorem to $f\\circ h$ we get $$(f \\circ h )'(c)=(f \\circ h )(1)-(f \\circ h )(0)$$ where $c\\in (0,1)$ and $$f '(h(c))(\\mathbf{b}-\\mathbf{a})=f(\\mathbf{b})-f(\\mathbf{a}) \\mbox{.}$$ If we set $\\zeta=h(c)$ we get $$f '(\\zeta)=\\frac{f(\\mathbf{b})-f(\\mathbf{a})}{\\mathbf{b}-\\mathbf{a}} \\mbox{.}$$ (Obviously $f '(\\zeta)$ is a gradient vector.)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me start by reading through the original problem carefully. The user is trying to prove the multi-dimensional Mean Value Theorem (MVT) and has provided a proof attempt. They want feedback on whether their proof is correct. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement from the original question. The example provided shows that assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. The problem statement is the actual thing to be proven.\n\nLooking at the original question, the user mentions proving the multi-dimensional MVT. Let me parse the details:\n\n- The function f: U → ℝ is differentiable, where U is an open subset of ℝ^n.\n- The points a and b are in U such that the entire line segment between them is contained in U.\n- They define a function h(t) that parameterizes the line segment between a and b, with t in [0,1].\n- They apply the single-variable MVT to f∘h, obtaining a point c in (0,1) where the derivative of f∘h equals f(b) - f(a).\n- Then they set ζ = h(c) and write the gradient vector equation.\n\nBut wait, in the single-variable MVT, the conclusion is that the derivative at some point equals the average rate of change. However, in higher dimensions, the MVT doesn't directly generalize as an equality of vectors; instead, it's an inequality, or you need to use the gradient in a dot product. The user's conclusion might be incorrect here. However, the problem statement they're working on is to \"prove multi-dimensional Mean Value Theorem,\" and their approach is using the single-variable MVT applied to the composition.\n\nBut for structuring the problem, I need to focus on the assumptions and the problem as presented, not the correctness of their proof. The original problem is their request to prove the theorem, so the assumptions are the conditions given in the theorem, and the problem is to prove it.\n\nSo the key assumptions from the multi-dimensional MVT are:\n\n1. U is an open subset of ℝ^n.\n2. f: U → ℝ is differentiable.\n3. The line segment between points a and b is entirely contained in U.\n\nEach assumption is a single condition applied to one object. Then the problem is to prove that there exists a point ζ on the line segment such that f(b) - f(a) equals the gradient of f at ζ dotted with (b - a). Wait, in the user's proof attempt, they wrote f'(ζ)(b - a) = f(b) - f(a), but in reality, it's the gradient (a row vector) multiplied by the vector (b - a) (a column vector), which is a scalar, matching the difference f(b) - f(a). However, the user's notation might be conflating the derivative (gradient) with the directional derivative. The precise statement should involve the dot product.\n\nBut the original problem as stated by the user is \"Prove multi-dimensional Mean Value Theorem,\" so the exact conclusion might be that there exists ζ such that f(b) - f(a) = ∇f(ζ) · (b - a). Therefore, the problem statement is to prove this equality under the given assumptions.\n\nNow, checking the user's proof attempt, they applied the single-variable MVT to f∘h, which is correct. The derivative of f∘h at c is the directional derivative of f in the direction of (b - a) at the point h(c), which is indeed ∇f(h(c)) · (b - a). So the conclusion should be f(b) - f(a) = ∇f(ζ) · (b - a), where ζ is on the line segment. Therefore, the user's final equation is missing the dot product, which might be an error. But again, for structuring their problem, I need to present their problem as they stated it, not correcting it.\n\nWait, in the user's proof, they wrote f'(ζ)(b - a) = f(b) - f(a). However, f'(ζ) is the gradient (a linear operator), so applying it to the vector (b - a) would give the directional derivative, which is indeed equal to f(b) - f(a). In notation, f'(ζ)(b - a) is correct if we consider the derivative as a linear map. However, in terms of vectors, this is equivalent to the dot product of the gradient and (b - a). So depending on notation, both can be correct. Therefore, the user's conclusion is correct if f' is the gradient (as a row vector) and (b - a) is a column vector, their product is the scalar. So maybe the problem is correctly stated by them.\n\nTherefore, structuring this into the required format:\n\nAssumptions:\n- U is an open subset of ℝ^n.\n- f: U → ℝ is differentiable.\n- The line segment between points a and b is contained in U.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a point ζ on the line segment between a and b such that f(b) - f(a) = f'(ζ)(b - a).\n\nWait, but in the original problem statement, the user writes \"f '(\\zeta) = (f(b) - f(a))/(b - a)\", which seems incorrect because in higher dimensions, division by a vector isn't defined. However, in their proof attempt, they actually have f'(h(c))(b - a) = f(b) - f(a), which is correct. So the problem they're trying to prove is the existence of ζ such that f'(ζ)(b - a) = f(b) - f(a), which is the correct multi-dimensional MVT statement. Therefore, the problem statement should be that.\n\nSo, to recap, the assumptions are about U being open, f being differentiable, and the line segment between a and b being in U. The problem is to prove the existence of ζ such that f'(ζ)(b - a) equals f(b) - f(a).\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is listed line by line, each addressing one property of one object. The problem is the statement to prove.",
