    "Content": "I am trying to prove that the number of integer solutions of $x^2-Ny^2=1$ is infinite whenever N is a squarefree integer. For this I define norm of $a+b\\sqrt N=a^2-Nb^2$. Now I prove that $a+b \\sqrt N$ forms a ring.Then I showed that a number is a unit iff its norm is one. So if there is one solution say $c+d\\sqrt N$ which is a unit then I will raise it to higher powers and I will hopefully get infinite units. $(a+b\\sqrt N)^2=a^2+Nb^2+2ab\\sqrt N$ Now if $N>2$ then the integer $a$ keeps increasing if the unit I start out with is not $+1$ or $-1$. But I am unable to show the existence of one such unit . If anyone has any ideas it would be great. Also I am interested in a proof which is essentially algebraic rather a number theoretic proof.Thanks",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I will sketch a classical approach. Lemma 1. If $N$ is a square-free positive integer, the continued fraction of $\\alpha=\\sqrt{N}$ has the following structure: $\\alpha=[M,\\overline{s,2M}]$ where $s$ is a palyndromic string of positive integer. I believe this Lemma dates back to Lagrange and Brouncker. Stein outlines a proof here . This Lemma is essentially equivalent to the fact that the class number of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$ is finite. By exploiting the structure of continued fractions one may prove that $\\frac{p}{q}=[M,s]$ is such that $p^2-Nq^2=1$. As an alternative, one may use the approach shown by Booher at page 8 here . There are an infinite number of convergents since $\\sqrt{N}$ is irrational, and only a finite number of choices for $p^2- Nq^2$, so there must be an $r$ with an infinite number of convergents satisfying $p^2 − Nq^2= r$. \nThere are only a finite number of choices for $(p, q)$ to reduce to modulo $r$, and an infinite number of convergents satisfying the equation, so there are two distinct convergents $(p_0 , q_0 )$ and $(p_1 , q_1 )$ with\n$p_0\\equiv p_1\\pmod{r}$ and $q_0\\equiv q_1\\pmod{r}$ and $p_0^2-Nq_0^2 =p_1^2-Nq_1^2 = r$. Thus we may consider the ratio\n$$ u=\\frac{p_0+q_0\\sqrt{N}}{p_1+q_1\\sqrt{N}}=\\frac{p_0p_1-Nq_0q_1+\\sqrt{N}(p_1 q_0-p_0 q_1)}{r} $$\nand notice that $p_0 p_1 − N q_0 q_1 \\equiv p_0^2-Nq_0^2 \\equiv 0\\pmod{r}$ and $ p_1 q_0 − q_1 p_0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{r}$, hence $u$ is of the form $p+qN$ with $p,q\\in\\mathbb{Z}$. Since the norm on $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ is multiplicative (aka Brahmagupta's identity), $u$ has norm 1. Therefore Pell’s equation has a non-trivial solution and $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{d}]$ has an infinite number of invertible elements.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user is asking about proving that the number of integer solutions to the Pell equation x² - Ny² = 1 is infinite when N is square-free. They mentioned using the concept of norms in the ring formed by numbers of the form a + b√N. \n\nFirst, the problem assumptions. The original question states that N is a square-free integer. The user wants to show infinitely many integer solutions (x, y) to x² - Ny² = 1. They defined the norm as a² - Nb² for elements a + b√N in the ring, and established that units in this ring have norm 1. Their approach is to find a non-trivial unit (not ±1) and then take its powers to generate infinitely many units, each corresponding to a solution.\n\nHowever, they are stuck on proving the existence of such a non-trivial unit. The example given in the problem structure needs to capture the key assumptions and the problem statement. \n\nLooking at the example provided earlier, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property. Here, N is square-free, which is one assumption. The problem is to prove the infinitude of integer solutions. The user's method relies on the ring structure and units, so perhaps another assumption is that the ring they defined (a + b√N with integers a, b) indeed forms a ring, but that's part of their approach rather than a given condition. Wait, the problem states that N is square-free, which is crucial because Pell's equation is typically considered for non-square N (since if N is a square, the equation becomes x² - (k²)y² = (x - ky)(x + ky) = 1, which has only trivial solutions). So square-free N ensures N is not a square, which is necessary for infinitely many solutions.\n\nTherefore, the key assumptions here are:\n\n1. N is a square-free integer.\n2. The equation in question is x² - Ny² = 1.\n3. The problem is to prove that the number of integer solutions is infinite.\n\nThe user's approach involves algebraic methods (ring structure, units) rather than number-theoretic ones. So the problem statement as per the format should be to prove the infinitude of solutions under the assumption that N is square-free.\n\nWait, but in their question, they say \"when N is a squarefree integer\". So the main assumption is N is square-free, and the problem is to prove infinite solutions. The user also mentions defining a norm and showing the ring structure, but those are part of their approach, not assumptions of the problem itself. Therefore, the assumptions to list would be N is square-free, and the problem is to prove the number of integer solutions is infinite. However, the original problem might have more conditions. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal question: \"Prove that the number of integer solutions of x² - Ny² = 1 is infinite whenever N is a squarefree integer.\" So the problem's assumption is that N is square-free, and the problem is to prove the infinitude of solutions. The user's own approach is using the ring structure and units, but that's their method. The actual problem as posed doesn't include those details as assumptions. So in the formatted problem, the assumptions should be just N is square-free, and the problem is to prove infinite solutions. However, in the example given earlier, the assumption included both that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7, but in that problem, the user might have included a wrong assumption. Wait, the original example in the user's message: the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, which is conflicting. Wait, that example seems incorrect. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which is not part of the original problem. That might be a mistake. But perhaps the user intended to filter out unrelated information. Wait, maybe the original problem had some confusion. Anyway, in the current problem, the user's question is to prove that the number of integer solutions is infinite when N is square-free. So the key assumption is N is square-free. Therefore, the formatted problem should have assumption: N is a square-free integer, and the problem is to prove that the number of integer solutions of x² - Ny² = 1 is infinite.\n\nHowever, the user's own approach mentions that they need to show existence of a non-trivial unit. So perhaps the problem, as per the user's setup, is under the assumption that such a unit exists? Wait, no. The user is stuck on showing the existence of a non-trivial unit. The problem they are trying to solve is the infinitude of solutions, given that N is square-free. Therefore, the formatted problem's assumptions should include the given conditions of the problem, not the user's attempted method. So the correct assumptions here are N is square-free. The problem is to prove infinite integer solutions.\n\nBut perhaps the user's problem setup includes that they already showed the ring structure and that units have norm 1, so maybe those are part of the assumptions? Wait, no. The problem as posed is to prove the infinitude of solutions given N is square-free. The user's steps (defining the norm, showing the ring, etc.) are their approach, not part of the problem's given assumptions. Therefore, the only assumption is N is square-free. But wait, Pell's equation x² - Ny² = 1 has infinitely many solutions when N is a positive non-square integer. Here, the user restricts to square-free N, which is a subset of non-square (since square-free implies not a square unless N=1, but 1 is a square). Wait, N being square-free would include N=1, but x² - 1*y² =1 has solutions (x,y) where x² - y²=1, which has solutions like (1,0), (2, √3) but y must be integer. Wait, (1,0), then (2, √3) is not integer. Actually, x² - y² =1 factors as (x - y)(x + y)=1, leading to x - y=1 and x + y=1, which gives x=1, y=0; or x - y=-1 and x + y=-1, x=-1, y=0. So only trivial solutions. Therefore, when N=1 (which is square-free), there are only trivial solutions, finite. Therefore, the problem must have N>1 and square-free. But the user didn't specify N>1. So perhaps the problem has an error. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem assumes N is a square-free positive integer greater than 1. Because otherwise, for N=1, the equation has only two solutions. Therefore, the assumption should be N is a square-free integer greater than 1. But in the original problem, the user says \"whenever N is a squarefree integer\". So maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement, but as per the user's question, we have to take it as given. Therefore, the formatted problem's assumption is N is a square-free integer, and the problem is to prove the number of integer solutions is infinite. But actually, for N=1, it's false. So perhaps the user intended N to be square-free and not equal to 1. But since the user didn't mention that, maybe we should stick to their exact words. However, in the context of Pell's equation, N is typically a positive non-square integer, so square-free (excluding 1) would be appropriate. Therefore, the assumption should be N is a square-free positive integer (excluding 1), but the user didn't specify. Since the user wrote \"squarefree integer\", but Pell's equation for N=1 doesn't have infinite solutions. So perhaps the correct assumption is N is a square-free positive integer greater than 1. But the original problem didn't specify, so we have to go with what's given. Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct as is, but the user made a mistake. Anyway, the formatted problem should follow the user's original question, so the assumption is N is a square-free integer, and the problem is to prove infinite solutions. But we have to note that in reality, this is only true if N is a positive non-square, but given the user's statement, we proceed.\n\nAnother point: the user mentions \"the number of integer solutions of x² - Ny²=1 is infinite\". So the problem is to prove that. The user's method involves using the ring of a + b√N and units. They showed that units correspond to solutions, and if there's a non-trivial unit (not ±1), then its powers give infinitely many units. But they can't prove the existence of such a unit. Therefore, the problem as per the user's setup is: under the assumption that N is square-free, prove infinite solutions. The user's own work reduced it to showing existence of a non-trivial unit. So perhaps the formatted problem should include the ring structure as part of the assumptions? No, because the problem itself doesn't mention the ring. The problem is purely number-theoretic. The user is using algebraic methods. Therefore, the problem's assumptions are only those given in the original problem statement: N is square-free. The rest is their approach. Therefore, the formatted problem should have assumption: N is a square-free integer. Problem: Prove that the number of integer solutions of x² - Ny² = 1 is infinite.\n\nBut wait, the example given in the user's message included assumptions from both the problem and the user's approach. For instance, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. That seems incorrect. So maybe the user made a mistake in their example. But following the user's instructions, the task is to \"filter the unrelated informations\" and structure the problem. So in the given example, perhaps the user considered that the original problem had a mistake and the correct assumption should include n divisible by 7. But actually, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which doesn't require divisibility by 7. However, 91=13*7, so the expression must be divisible by both 7 and 13. The example's formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which actually changes the problem. This suggests that maybe the user wants to correct the problem's assumptions based on context. But that's risky. Alternatively, maybe the example is flawed. But the user says \"filtered the unrelated informations\", so perhaps the task is to extract the core assumptions from the problem statement, ignoring any extraneous details in the question. In the current problem, the user's question starts with \"Prove that the number of integer solutions of x²-Ny²=1 is infinite whenever N is a squarefree integer.\" Therefore, the key assumption is that N is square-free. The problem is to prove infinitude of solutions. So the formatted problem should list assumption: N is a square-free integer. Problem: Prove that the number of integer solutions of x² - Ny² = 1 is infinite.\n\nHowever, the user's own approach mentions that they need to show existence of a non-trivial unit. But the problem as posed doesn't include that as an assumption. Therefore, the formatted problem should only include the assumptions given in the problem statement, not the user's approach. Therefore, the correct formatted problem is:\n\nAssumption:\nN is a square-free integer.\nProblem:\nProve that the number of integer solutions of $x^2 - Ny^2 = 1$ is infinite.\n\nBut wait, the user also mentions \"I define norm of $a+b\\sqrt N = a^2 - Nb^2$. Now I prove that $a + b \\sqrt N$ forms a ring. Then I showed that a number is a unit iff its norm is one.\" So in their approach, they have already established that the ring has units characterized by norm 1. Therefore, the problem is to show infinite units (solutions) given that structure. But in the problem statement, the user is combining their approach with the original problem. However, the original problem as posed is just to prove infinite solutions when N is square-free. The user's method is their own approach, which is part of the question, not the problem's assumptions. Therefore, the formatted problem should reflect the original problem's conditions, not the user's attempted proof steps. Hence, the assumption is N is square-free, and the problem is to prove infinite integer solutions.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nN is a square-free integer.\nProblem:\nProve that the number of integer solutions of $x^2 - Ny^2 = 1$ is infinite.\n###",
