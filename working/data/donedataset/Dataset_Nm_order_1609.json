    "AcceptedAnswer": "Goal: show that $\\mathbb{Z}$ is a principal ideal domain (or PID). Let $I$ be an ideal of $\\mathbb Z$ .\nIf $I={0}$ then $0$ generates $I$ . And we are done. Suppose $I\\neq \\{0\\}$ , and let $a$ be the smallest positive element in $I$ . Such an element exists by the well-ordering principle . Claim: $a$ generates $I$ (i.e., $(a)=I$ ). Clearly, $(a)\\subseteq I$ since $(a)= \\{ar :r \\in \\mathbb Z\\}$ , $ar\\in I$ . Let $b \\in I$ . By the euclidean algorithm we have $$b=aq+r.$$ Moreover, $0\\le r<a$ , and of course $q,r \\in \\mathbb Z$ . Now, $r=b-aq \\in I$ since $b,a \\in I$ . this implies $r=0$ since $r<a$ and $a$ is the smallest positive element in $I$ . So, $b=aq \\in I$ . Thus, $(a)=I$ , meaning that $a$ generates $I$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. The original question is about showing that every ideal of the ring of integers ℤ is principal. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The example provided had two assumptions: one about n being an integer and another about divisibility by 7. But looking at the current problem, the question states that ℤ is the ring of integers. So the main assumption here is that we're dealing with the ring ℤ. There might be other implicit assumptions, but the problem doesn't mention any specific conditions like n being divisible by something. The example included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (the divisibility by 7), but that might have been part of a specific problem's conditions. In this case, the problem is general about all ideals in ℤ.\n\nWait, the example might have had an extra assumption because the original problem there required n to be an integer and perhaps the user's example included an additional condition. But in this problem, the only given information is that ℤ is the ring, and we need to show every ideal is principal. So the assumption is just that we're working within the ring of integers. \n\nSo the Assumption section should list each condition. Here, the ring is ℤ, and ideals in this context. But the problem statement doesn't add more conditions; it's a general proof. So maybe the assumption is only that we're considering ideals of ℤ. The problem is to show each such ideal is principal. \n\nI need to ensure that each assumption is a single line, one property per line. Since the ring is specified as ℤ, that's one assumption. Are there others? The problem doesn't specify any restrictions, so perhaps just the ring being ℤ. Wait, but maybe the definition of an ideal is also an assumption here? But the problem is about ideals in general in ℤ, so perhaps the only assumption is that we're dealing with an ideal of ℤ. Wait, the problem says \"every ideal of the ring ℤ\", so the assumption is that the ideal is in ℤ. So the assumption line would be: \"I is an ideal of the ring ℤ.\" But the user's example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" So in this case, maybe the assumption is that I is an ideal of ℤ. But the problem is to show that every such I is principal. So the assumption is that I is an ideal of ℤ. But the problem statement is general, so the assumption is that I is any ideal of ℤ, and the problem is to show it's principal.\n\nBut in the example given by the user, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", and the formatted assumption listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the original example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect? Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem example: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. Formatted assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that seems like a mistake because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", not just those divisible by 7. So perhaps there was an error in the example. If that's the case, maybe the user wants me to extract assumptions from the problem, even if they are not explicitly stated. Wait, but the problem here is about ideals in ℤ, so the only assumption is that I is an ideal of ℤ. Therefore, the formatted problem should have assumption: I is an ideal of the ring ℤ. Problem: Show that I is principal.\n\nBut the original problem's title is \"Show that every ideal of the ring ℤ is principal\". So the problem is to show that any ideal I of ℤ is principal. Therefore, the assumption is that I is an ideal of ℤ, and the problem is to show that I is principal. So the Assumption section would list \"I is an ideal of the ring ℤ.\" and that's it. Each assumption on one line, each addressing one property. Since there's only one assumption here, that's all.",
