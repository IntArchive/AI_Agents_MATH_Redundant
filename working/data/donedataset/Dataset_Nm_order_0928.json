    "Content": "Suppose $f$ and $g$ are entire functions, and $|f(z)| \\leq |g(z)|$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$, Prove that $f(z)=cg(z)$. My try : I consider $h(z)=\\frac{f(z)}{g(z)}$. If I prove that $h(z)$ is entire, using the fact that $|h(z)|\\leq 1$, the result follows immediately from Liouville's theorem. To prove that $h(z)$ is entire, I have to prove that $h(z)$ has removable singularities at possible zeros of $g(z)$. Suppose $g(z_0)=0 \\Rightarrow |g(z_0)|=0 \\Rightarrow |f(z_0)|=0$, BUT what if $z_0$ be a root of of order $k$ of $g(z)$ (i.e. $f^{(n)}(z_0) = 0 $ for all $ 0 \\leq n \\leq k-1$) and be a zero of order $m$ of $f(z)$ and $k>m$ ? And if that's not the case, how to rigorously show that $z_0$ is a removable singularity ? Thank you all in advance.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Suppose that $g$ has a zero at $a$. If $f$ is identically zero, we are done, as $0=0g$, so we may assume this is not the case, which implies that $g$ is not identically zero either, and therefore we may assume instead that it has a zero of order precisely $k$ at $a$, so $g(z)=(z-a)^kh(z)$, where $h$ is analytic in a neighborhood of $a$, and $h(a)\\ne 0$. Since $|f|\\le|g|$, then $f(a)=0$, so $f(z)=(z-a)^mj(z)$ where $j(a)\\ne0$ and $j$ is analytic in a neighborhood of $a$. For $z\\ne a$ near $a$, $|f|\\le|g|$ means that $$\\displaystyle\\left|\\frac{(z-a)^{m-k}j(z)}{h(z)}\\right|\\le 1.$$ Since $j$ and $h$ are not zero near $a$, by continuity there is a constant $K$ such that $|j/h|\\ge 1/K$ in a neighborhood of $a$, so $$\\left|\\frac{(z-a)^{m-k}j(z)}{h(z)}\\right|\\ge\\frac{|z-a|^{m-k}}K,$$ or $|z-a|^{m-k}\\le K$ for $z\\ne a$ near $a$. But this is impossible if $m<k$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem step by step. The question is about proving that if f and g are entire functions with |f(z)| ≤ |g(z)| for all z in the complex plane, then f(z) must be a constant multiple of g(z). The user mentioned trying to use h(z) = f(z)/g(z) and applying Liouville's theorem, but they were concerned about the singularities where g(z) has zeros.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what entire functions are. Entire functions are holomorphic everywhere on the complex plane. So both f and g have no singularities except possibly at infinity. Now, the inequality |f(z)| ≤ |g(z)| holds everywhere. If g(z) is never zero, then h(z) = f(z)/g(z) would be entire and bounded, hence constant by Liouville's theorem. But the problem is that g(z) might have zeros. \n\nThe user's concern is about the points where g(z) has zeros. Suppose z₀ is a zero of g. Then since |f(z₀)| ≤ |g(z₀)| = 0, f(z₀) must also be zero. So both f and g vanish at z₀. But the key is the multiplicity of these zeros. If z₀ is a zero of g of order k, then near z₀, g(z) behaves like (z - z₀)^k times some non-vanishing holomorphic function. Similarly, f(z) would have a zero of order m at z₀. The user is worried if m < k, then h(z) would have a pole of order k - m at z₀, which would make h(z) not entire. But since |h(z)| = |f(z)/g(z)| ≤ 1 everywhere, including near z₀, a pole would make |h(z)| unbounded near z₀, contradicting the bound. Therefore, h(z) cannot have a pole there, so the singularity at z₀ must be removable. This implies that m ≥ k for every zero z₀ of g. Wait, but if m ≥ k, then h(z) would have a zero of order m - k at z₀, meaning h(z) is holomorphic there. \n\nHowever, the original inequality |f(z)| ≤ |g(z)| might imply that m ≥ k. Let me check this. If g(z) has a zero of order k at z₀, then near z₀, |g(z)| ≈ |z - z₀|^k. Since |f(z)| ≤ |g(z)|, then near z₀, |f(z)| ≤ C|z - z₀|^k. Therefore, f(z) must vanish at least to order k at z₀; otherwise, if f had a lower order zero, say m < k, then near z₀, |f(z)| would be ≈ |z - z₀|^m, which is larger than |z - z₀|^k when m < k and z is close to z₀, contradicting the inequality. Therefore, m ≥ k. Hence, the quotient h(z) = f(z)/g(z) has a removable singularity at z₀, because the numerator has a zero of order at least k, and the denominator has a zero of order k. So h(z) is analytic everywhere, bounded by 1, hence constant. Therefore, f(z) = c g(z).\n\nSo the key assumptions here are that both f and g are entire, the modulus inequality holds everywhere, and then showing that the ratio is entire and bounded. The user's concern about the zeros is addressed by the fact that the inequality enforces the multiplicities of the zeros of f to be at least those of g, hence the ratio has no poles, only removable singularities. Therefore, h(z) is entire and bounded, so constant.\n\nSo structuring this into the required format, the assumptions are that f and g are entire, the modulus inequality holds for all z, and the problem is to prove f is a constant multiple of g. The original problem statement doesn't mention any specific conditions on the zeros, but the assumptions need to list all the given conditions. The problem's answer hinges on the given conditions implying that the ratio is entire, which is part of the problem solving, not the assumption. Therefore, the assumptions are just the entireness of f and g and the modulus inequality.",
