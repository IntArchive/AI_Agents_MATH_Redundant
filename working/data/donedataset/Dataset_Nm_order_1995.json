    "AcceptedAnswer": "I'm going to assume you mean $$(E(XY))^2 \\le  E(X^2)E(Y^2).$$ One way to prove this is to realize it's a special case of the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality. Here's another.  Let \\begin{align}\nf(t) = {} & E((tX+Y)^2) \\\\[8pt]\n= {} & (E(X^2)) t^2 + 2(E(XY))t + E(Y^2) \\\\[8pt]\n= {} & at^2 + bt + c.\n\\end{align} where $t$ is \"constant\", i.e. not random.  Clearly $E((tX+Y)^2)\\ge0$ for all real values of $t$ .  Now recall that for real $a,b,c$ , the polynomial $at^2 + bt+c$ remains non-negative as $t$ changes if and only if $a\\ge0$ and the discriminant $b^2-4ac\\le0$ .  So $$\nb^2-4ac = 4E(XY)^2 - 4E(X^2)E(Y^2).\n$$ So $$\n4(E(XY)^2 - E(X^2)E(Y^2))\\le0.\n$$ Divide both sides by $4$ and there you have it.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let me tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original question is about proving that for random variables X and Y, the inequality E(XY)^2 ≤ E(X²)E(Y²) always holds. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The problem states \"Given Random variables X and Y,\" so the main assumptions are about X and Y being random variables. However, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which this question relates to, usually requires some conditions like the expectations E(X²) and E(Y²) being finite. But the original problem doesn't explicitly mention these. The user's example included assumptions that were in the original problem, even if some were implied. Since the original problem doesn't specify finiteness of second moments, maybe I shouldn't add that. Wait, but in the example provided, the assumption about n being divisible by 7 was part of the original problem. In this case, the problem as stated doesn't have additional conditions beyond X and Y being random variables. However, to apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we do need that E(X²) and E(Y²) are finite. But the question says \"is it true always,\" so maybe the user expects the answer to mention that under the assumption that the second moments exist. But since the original problem doesn't state that, should I include it as an assumption? Hmm. The example given by the user included an assumption that was in the original problem, even if it wasn't necessary. Wait, looking at the example: the original problem said \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" which was not in the original. Wait, no, the original problem in the example was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\", which actually isn't part of the original problem. Wait, that might be a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem under assumptions lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" But the original problem states \"for every integer n,\" so the assumption that n is an integer is correct. However, the second assumption \"n is divisible by 7\" was not in the original problem. That seems incorrect. The user's example might have a mistake. Therefore, maybe the user's approach is to list all conditions, even those that are part of the problem's premise. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to include any necessary conditions, even if not stated, but in the example, the problem was about divisibility by 91, which factors into 7*13. So if n is divisible by both 7 and 13, then 5^n and 6^n would have certain properties. But the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7 or 13. So maybe there's a confusion here. Therefore, perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user wants me to follow the same approach, which might involve extracting assumptions from the problem statement.\n\nBut in the current problem, the original question is: \"Given Random variables X and Y is it true always that E(XY)^2 ≤ E(X²)E(Y²)? Is it easy to prove?\"\n\nSo the assumptions here are that X and Y are random variables. However, for the inequality to hold, we need that E(X²) and E(Y²) are finite. Otherwise, the expectations might not exist. So technically, the correct assumptions should include that X and Y have finite second moments. But the original problem doesn't state that. Therefore, do I include that as an assumption or not?\n\nIn the user's example, they added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (n divisible by 7). Therefore, maybe the user wants to list all necessary assumptions, even if they have to be inferred. Alternatively, maybe they want to strictly list what's given. But in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, which is correct. But then the second assumption \"n is divisible by 7\" was added, which wasn't in the original. That seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the original problem had a typo or was misrepresented. Alternatively, maybe the example is incorrect, but the user wants me to proceed regardless.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps I should follow the problem as stated. The original question here says \"Given Random variables X and Y\", so the assumption is that X and Y are random variables. The inequality E(XY)^2 ≤ E(X²)E(Y²) is the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which holds provided that E(X²) and E(Y²) are finite. If they are not, then the right-hand side might be infinite, or the left-hand side might not be defined. So to make the problem valid, we need X and Y to have finite second moments. Therefore, even though the original problem doesn't state this, it's a necessary assumption for the inequality to hold. Therefore, I should include that as an assumption.\n\nBut the user's example added an assumption not present in the original problem, which might indicate that the user wants to list all necessary assumptions even if not stated. Therefore, I will list:\n\nAssumption:\nX and Y are random variables,\nE(X²) is finite,\nE(Y²) is finite.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$E(XY)^2 \\le E(X^2)E(Y^2)$$\n\nBut the original problem says \"is it true always\" which implies that under the given conditions (X and Y being random variables), is the inequality always true. The answer is that it's true provided that E(X²) and E(Y²) are finite. So if we don't assume that, then the inequality might not hold because the expectations could be infinite or undefined. Therefore, to answer the question correctly, the assumptions should include finite second moments. Hence, in the formatted problem, those assumptions should be listed.",
