    "Content": "Let $\\,f:[0,\\infty)\\to [0,\\infty)$ be a function such that $\\,f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y),\\,$ for all $\\,x,y\\ge 0$. Prove that $\\,f(x)=ax,\\,$ for some constant $a$.

    "AcceptedAnswer": "In your proof you assume that $f$ is differentiable, which is not given. Let me suggest how to obtain the formula of $f$: Step I. Show that $\\,f(px)=p\\,f(x),\\,$ when $p$ is a positive rational and $x$ a non-negative real. (At first show this for $p$ integer.) We obtain also that, $\\,f(0)=0$. Step II. Observe that $f$ is increasing, since, for $y>x$, we have\n$$\nf(y)=f(x)+f(y-x)\\ge f(x).\n$$ Step III. Since $f$ is increasing, then the limit $\\,\\lim_{x\\to 0^+}f(x)\\,$ exists. However\n$$\n\\lim_{x\\to 0^+}f(x)=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f\\Big(\\frac{1}{n}\\Big)\n=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{1}{n}\\,f(1)=0.\n$$ Step IV. Pick an arbitrary $x\\in(0,\\infty)$, and a decreasing sequence\n$\\{q_n\\}\\subset\\mathbb Q$ tending to $x$. Then\n$$\nf(q_n)=q_n\\,f(1)\n$$\nand\n$$\nx\\,f(1)\\longleftarrow q_n\\,f(1)=f(q_n)=f(x)+f(q_n-x)\\longrightarrow f(x),\n$$\nsince $\\,\\,q_n-x\\to 0^+$, and thus $\\,\\,\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f(q_n-x)=0$. Therefore, $\\,f(x)=x\\,f(1),\\,$ for all $x\\in\\mathbb [0,\\infty)$, and hence $\\,f'(x)=f(1)$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me start by understanding the original problem and the example provided.\n\nThe original problem is about proving that a function f defined from [0, ∞) to [0, ∞) satisfying the Cauchy equation f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) for all x, y ≥ 0 must be of the form f(x) = ax. The user's proof uses differentiation, but they're asking if their approach is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement following the example. The example took the original problem, listed each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then restated the problem concisely.\n\nLooking at the problem here: the function f has domain and codomain [0, ∞), and it satisfies the additive property f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) for all non-negative x and y. The goal is to prove f(x) = ax for some constant a.\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n1. f is defined from [0, ∞) to [0, ∞). So domain and codomain are both non-negative.\n2. f satisfies the Cauchy functional equation: f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) for all x, y ≥ 0.\n\nBut wait, in the example, they listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. So here, each condition should be a separate line. Let me parse the problem:\n\nThe function f: [0, ∞) → [0, ∞). That's the first assumption. Then, for all x, y ≥ 0, f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y). That's the second assumption. The problem is to prove f(x) = ax for some constant a.\n\nBut the user's proof uses differentiation. However, the problem as stated doesn't mention any differentiability condition. So the user might be assuming differentiability, but the original problem doesn't specify that. Wait, the original problem's question is whether the proof is correct. So in the problem statement, the user is proposing a proof that uses differentiation, but perhaps the assumptions don't include differentiability. Therefore, the original problem's assumptions are just the domain and the Cauchy equation. The user added the differentiability in their proof, but the problem itself doesn't state that f is differentiable. So when structuring the problem, we need to list only the original problem's assumptions, not the ones introduced in the user's proof.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. f is a function from [0, ∞) to [0, ∞).\n2. For all x, y ≥ 0, f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y).\n\nProblem: Prove that f(x) = ax for some constant a.\n\nBut in the example, the assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". However, in the original problem here, there's no mention of differentiability. The user's proof assumes differentiability, but the problem as posed doesn't. So the correct formatting should include the original problem's assumptions, not the ones from the user's proof. Therefore, the assumptions are as above.\n\nBut wait, maybe the original problem's title includes the function f: [0, ∞) → [0, ∞), which is the domain and codomain. Then, the functional equation. So those are the two assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list these two assumptions and then the problem statement.\n\nNow, checking the example again: the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7; that might have been part of the solution. Wait, no, the example's original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example had a mistake? Wait, looking at the example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that seems like the formatted problem added an assumption that wasn't in the original. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Unless there was a miscommunication. Wait, maybe the user intended to show that in the example, the original problem was different, and the formatted problem adjusted the assumptions. Hmm. This might be confusing. But according to the user's instruction, the task is to read the Math Stack Exchange question, filter unrelated information, and structure the problem into assumptions and problem statement as per the example.\n\nIn the given example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions include n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But that's adding an extra condition. Maybe the example was incorrect, or perhaps the user intended to show a different problem. Anyway, perhaps in the example, maybe the original problem had a typo or the formatted version had a mistake. But regardless, the current task is to process the given problem.\n\nSo for the current problem: the function f: [0, ∞) → [0, ∞), satisfying f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) for all x, y ≥ 0. Prove f(x) = ax.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. f: [0, ∞) → [0, ∞).\n2. For all x, y ≥ 0, f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y).\n\nProblem: Prove that f(x) = ax for some constant a.\n\nThe user's proof uses differentiation, but the problem doesn't state that f is differentiable. So the user's approach might be incomplete because they assume differentiability, which isn't given. Therefore, in the structured problem, we shouldn't include differentiability as an assumption unless it's part of the original problem. Since the original problem doesn't mention differentiability, it's not an assumption. Therefore, the correct assumptions are the two listed above.\n\nSo the formatted problem should list those two assumptions and the problem statement to prove f(x) = ax.",
