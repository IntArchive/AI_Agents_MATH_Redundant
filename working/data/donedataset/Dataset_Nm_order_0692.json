    "Content": "I'm trying to solve the following problem (from do Carmo's Riemannian Geometry). particularly I'm having trouble proving that the inner product defined is bilinear. Problem. It is possible to define a Riemannian metric in the tangent bundle $TM$ of a Riemannian manifold $M$ in the following manner. Let $(p,v)\\in TM$ and $V,W$ be tangent vectors to $TM$ at $(p,v).$ Choose curves in $TM$ $$\\begin{align*}& \\alpha: t \\rightarrow (p(t), v(t))\\\\\n& \\beta: s \\rightarrow (q(s), w(s))\\end{align*}$$ with $p(0)=q(0)=p$ , $v(0)=w(0)=v$ and $V=\\alpha'(0)$ , $W=\\beta'(0)$ .\nDefine an inner product on $TM$ by $$\\langle V,W \\rangle_{(p,v)} = \\left\\langle d\\pi(V), d\\pi(W)  \\right\\rangle_{p} + \\left\\langle \\frac{Dv}{dt}(0) , \\frac{Dw}{ds}(0) \\right \\rangle_{p},$$ where $\\pi:TM \\rightarrow M$ . Prove this is a well-defined Riemannian metric on $TM$ .",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The two terms you wrote down are roughly the horizontal and vertical parts of the metric. Roughly speaking, the first part gives the metric for the first factor $T_pM$ of $T_{p,v}TM$. The second part gives the metric for the second factor $T_vT_pM$. By the definition of the projection operator $\\pi$ and the definition of the covariant derivative on $(M,\\langle\\cdot\\rangle)$, it is clear that the expression you wrote down is coordinate independent. There are several things to check to make sure that it is a metric It is positive definite It is bilinear It is tensorial Since we already have coordinate independence, it is most convenient to work over a fixed coordinate system. Let $\\{x^1,\\ldots,x^n\\}$ be a system of coordinates for $M$; this can be extended to a system of local coordinates $\\{x^1,\\ldots,x^n;y^1,\\ldots,y^n\\}$ for $TM$ where $(x,y)$ corresponds to the point $(p,v)\\in TM$ with $p$ the point in $M$ specified by $x$, and $v\\in T_pM$ given by $\\sum y^i\\partial/\\partial x^i$. At a fixed point $(p,v)$, an element of $T_{p,v}TM$ can be then described by \n$$ V = \\sum \\xi^i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i} + \\sum \\zeta^i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^i}$$\nwith the  projection \n$$ d\\pi(V) = \\sum \\xi^i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i} $$ Express the curve $\\alpha(t) = (p,v)(t)$ in this coordinates we have that the condition $\\alpha'(0) = V$ is simply the statement that $\\frac{d}{dt}p^i(0) = \\xi^i$ and $\\frac{d}{dt}v^i(0) = \\zeta^i$. With this we can compute\n$$ \\frac{D}{dt}v^i(0) = \\frac{d}{dt} v^i(0) + \\Gamma^i_{jk}\\left(\\frac{d}{dt}p^j(0)\\right)\\left(v^k(0)\\right) $$\nusing the definition, and where $\\Gamma$ is the Christoffel symbol of the Riemannian metric on $M$. This we immediately see to be \n$$ \\frac{D}{dt}v^i(0) = \\zeta^i + \\Gamma^i_{jk}v^k(0)\\xi^j $$\nwhich in fact is a linear map from $T_{p,v}TM$ to $T_pM$. Now the three properties are easily checked: It is tensorial because the expressions are completely independent of which curve $\\alpha$ is chosen, as long as $\\alpha'(0)= V$. It is bilinear because $T_{p,v}TM\\ni V\\mapsto (d\\pi(V),\\frac{D}{dt}v(0))\\in T_pM \\oplus T_pM$ is linear, and the Riemannian metric on $M$ is bilinear Since the Riemannian metric induced on $T_pM\\oplus T_pM$ is positive definite, to prove that the new object is also positive definite, it suffices to check that the map $V\\mapsto (d\\pi(V),\\frac{D}{dt}v(0))$ is injective. But this is true by direct inspection.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to format the given problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified structure. The original problem is about proving that a certain inner product on the tangent bundle TM is a well-defined Riemannian metric. The user provided an example where assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition for one object.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question. The problem is from do Carmo's Riemannian Geometry. The task is to show that the defined inner product on TM is a well-defined Riemannian metric. The key points here are the definition of the inner product using the curves α and β, the projections via dπ, and the covariant derivatives of the vector fields v(t) and w(s).\n\nThe user in the example extracted assumptions like \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n is divisible by 7\". Here, the assumptions would be the conditions given in the problem setup. Let me list them:\n\n1. M is a Riemannian manifold.\n2. TM is the tangent bundle of M.\n3. (p,v) is a point in TM.\n4. V and W are tangent vectors to TM at (p,v).\n5. α and β are curves in TM such that α(t) = (p(t), v(t)) and β(s) = (q(s), w(s)).\n6. p(0) = q(0) = p.\n7. v(0) = w(0) = v.\n8. V is the derivative of α at 0, i.e., α'(0) = V.\n9. W is the derivative of β at 0, i.e., β'(0) = W.\n10. The inner product is defined as the sum of the inner products of the projections via dπ and the covariant derivatives of v and w at 0.\n\nEach of these should be separate assumptions. However, some might be combined if they refer to the same object. For example, points 6 and 7 are about the initial conditions of the curves. Also, the inner product's definition involves multiple components, but it's part of the problem statement, not assumptions. The assumptions are the given conditions that set up the problem.\n\nWait, in the example, the assumption was about the properties of n. Here, the assumptions are the structures given: M is Riemannian, TM is its tangent bundle, the curves α and β with specific properties, etc. So each of these should be separate lines in the assumptions.\n\nLet me structure them:\n\nAssumption:\n- M is a Riemannian manifold.\n- TM is the tangent bundle of M.\n- (p, v) is a point in TM.\n- V and W are tangent vectors to TM at (p, v).\n- α: t ↦ (p(t), v(t)) is a curve in TM with α(0) = (p, v) and α’(0) = V.\n- β: s ↦ (q(s), w(s)) is a curve in TM with β(0) = (p, v) and β’(0) = W.\n- The inner product ⟨V, W⟩_{(p,v)} is defined as ⟨dπ(V), dπ(W)⟩_p + ⟨Dv/dt(0), Dw/ds(0)⟩_p.\n- π: TM → M is the projection map.\n\nBut wait, some of these are part of the problem setup rather than assumptions. The problem is to prove that the defined inner product is a well-defined Riemannian metric. So the assumptions are the given data: M is Riemannian, the curves are defined as such, etc.\n\nWait, the example given by the user had assumptions as the conditions that the problem states. For instance, in the example, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption was \"$n$ is an integer\". Then there was another assumption \"$n$ is divisible by 7\" which was perhaps part of the problem but needed to be extracted.\n\nIn this current problem, the problem states: Let M be a Riemannian manifold, TM its tangent bundle, (p,v) a point in TM, V and W tangent vectors to TM at (p,v), with curves α and β defined as such. Then the inner product is defined as... The task is to prove it's a well-defined Riemannian metric.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should list all the given conditions:\n\n- M is a Riemannian manifold.\n- TM is the tangent bundle of M.\n- (p, v) is a point in TM.\n- V and W are tangent vectors to TM at (p, v).\n- α and β are curves in TM such that α(0) = (p, v) and β(0) = (p, v).\n- The derivatives α’(0) = V and β’(0) = W.\n- The inner product is defined using the projection π and the covariant derivatives.\n\nBut each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So splitting them:\n\nAssumption:\n- M is a Riemannian manifold.\n- TM is the tangent bundle of M.\n- (p, v) is an element of TM.\n- V is a tangent vector to TM at (p, v).\n- W is a tangent vector to TM at (p, v).\n- α is a curve in TM with α(0) = (p, v).\n- The derivative of α at 0 is V.\n- β is a curve in TM with β(0) = (p, v).\n- The derivative of β at 0 is W.\n- The projection map π: TM → M is smooth.\n- The covariant derivatives Dv/dt and Dw/ds are defined using the Riemannian connection on M.\n\nWait, but the problem defines the inner product using dπ(V), dπ(W), and the covariant derivatives. The problem doesn't state that M has a Riemannian connection, but since M is a Riemannian manifold, it does have a Levi-Civita connection. So maybe that's an implicit assumption. But perhaps the user wants only the explicit assumptions from the problem statement.\n\nLooking back at the original problem statement:\n\n\"Let $(p,v)\\in TM$ and $V,W$ be tangent vectors to $TM$ at $(p,v).$ Choose curves in $TM$ $$\\begin{align*}& \\alpha: t \\rightarrow (p(t), v(t))\\\\ & \\beta: s \\rightarrow (q(s), w(s))\\end{align*}$$ with $p(0)=q(0)=p$ , $v(0)=w(0)=v$ and $V=\\alpha'(0)$ , $W=\\beta'(0)$.\"\n\nSo explicit assumptions:\n\n- M is a Riemannian manifold.\n- TM is the tangent bundle of M.\n- (p, v) is a point in TM.\n- V and W are tangent vectors to TM at (p, v).\n- α and β are curves in TM with α(0) = (p, v) and β(0) = (p, v).\n- The curves α and β satisfy p(0) = q(0) = p and v(0) = w(0) = v.\n- V is the derivative of α at 0.\n- W is the derivative of β at 0.\n- The inner product is defined as ⟨dπ(V), dπ(W)⟩_p + ⟨Dv/dt(0), Dw/ds(0)⟩_p.\n- π: TM → M is the projection map.\n\nEach of these should be separate lines. But some can be merged. For example, \"α and β are curves in TM with α(0) = (p, v), β(0) = (p, v)\" and \"p(0) = q(0) = p, v(0) = w(0) = v\" are part of the same conditions for the curves. But since the problem says \"Choose curves in TM... with p(0)=q(0)=p, v(0)=w(0)=v and V=α'(0), W=β'(0)\", these can be split into:\n\n- α: t ↦ (p(t), v(t)) is a curve in TM.\n- β: s ↦ (q(s), w(s)) is a curve in TM.\n- p(0) = q(0) = p.\n- v(0) = w(0) = v.\n- V = α’(0).\n- W = β’(0).\n\nSo each of these is a separate assumption. Similarly, the inner product definition is part of the problem statement, but the structure requires the problem to be stated as is, with the assumptions listed. So the assumptions would be the setup before the inner product is defined.\n\nHence, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n- M is a Riemannian manifold.\n- TM is the tangent bundle of M.\n- (p, v) is a point in TM.\n- V and W are tangent vectors to TM at (p, v).\n- α: t → (p(t), v(t)) is a curve in TM.\n- β: s → (q(s), w(s)) is a curve in TM.\n- p(0) = q(0) = p.\n- v(0) = w(0) = v.\n- V is the derivative of α at t=0.\n- W is the derivative of β at s=0.\n- π: TM → M is the projection map.\n- The covariant derivatives Dv/dt(0) and Dw/ds(0) are defined using the Riemannian connection on M.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't explicitly mention the Riemannian connection. It just says \"the inner product... includes the covariant derivatives\". Since M is a Riemannian manifold, the Levi-Civita connection is implied, so maybe that's an assumption. However, the original problem statement might not mention the connection explicitly, so perhaps we shouldn't include it unless stated.\n\nThe problem defines the inner product with the covariant derivatives, so the connection is part of the structure. So the assumption that M is Riemannian includes the existence of the Levi-Civita connection. So maybe that's already covered by \"M is a Riemannian manifold\".\n\nTherefore, the final list of assumptions would be each of the given conditions in the problem setup, each as a separate line.\n\nPutting it all together, the assumptions are:\n\n- M is a Riemannian manifold.\n- TM is the tangent bundle of M.\n- (p, v) is a point in TM.\n- V and W are tangent vectors to TM at (p, v).\n- α(t) = (p(t), v(t)) is a curve in TM with α(0) = (p, v).\n- β(s) = (q(s), w(s)) is a curve in TM with β(0) = (p, v).\n- V = α’(0).\n- W = β’(0).\n- π: TM → M is the projection map.\n- The inner product ⟨V, W⟩_{(p,v)} is defined as ⟨dπ(V), dπ(W)⟩_p + ⟨Dv/dt(0), Dw/ds(0)⟩_p.\n\nWait, but the definition of the inner product is part of the problem statement. The user's example included the problem statement as \"Prove that... is divisible by 91.\" So here, the problem is to prove that the defined inner product is a well-defined Riemannian metric.\n\nSo the assumptions are the given conditions, and the problem is to prove the inner product is well-defined and a Riemannian metric.\n\nThus, the assumptions should list all the setup conditions, each as a separate line, and the problem is the actual statement to prove.\n\nNow, structuring:\n\nAssumption:\n- M is a Riemannian manifold.\n- TM is the tangent bundle of M.\n- (p, v) is a point in TM.\n- V and W are tangent vectors to TM at (p, v).\n- α: t ↦ (p(t), v(t)) is a curve in TM.\n- β: s ↦ (q(s), w(s)) is a curve in TM.\n- p(0) = q(0) = p.\n- v(0) = w(0) = v.\n- V is the derivative of α at t=0.\n- W is the derivative of β at s=0.\n- π: TM → M is the projection map.\n- The inner product ⟨V, W⟩_{(p,v)} combines the metric on M applied to dπ(V) and dπ(W), and the covariant derivatives of v and w at 0.\n\nBut maybe some of these can be combined. For instance, the curves α and β are defined with specific properties. But according to the user's example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So each bullet should be a single condition.\n\nFor example:\n\nAssumption:\n- M is a Riemannian manifold.\n- TM is the tangent bundle of M.\n- (p, v) is an element of TM.\n- V is a tangent vector to TM at the point (p, v).\n- W is a tangent vector to TM at the point (p, v).\n- α: t → (p(t), v(t)) is a smooth curve in TM.\n- β: s → (q(s), w(s)) is a smooth curve in TM.\n- The curve α satisfies α(0) = (p, v).\n- The curve β satisfies β(0) = (p, v).\n- The derivative of α at t=0 is V.\n- The derivative of β at s=0 is W.\n- The projection map π: TM → M is smooth.\n- The covariant derivatives Dv/dt(0) and Dw/ds(0) are defined using the Levi-Civita connection of M.\n\nHowever, the problem statement doesn't explicitly mention the Levi-Civita connection, just the covariant derivatives. Since the problem is from do Carmo's book, which uses the Levi-Civita connection, but maybe we shouldn't add that unless it's stated. The problem says \"the inner product... is defined by...\", so the covariant derivatives are part of the definition.\n\nBut in the assumptions, we need to include all given conditions. The problem defines the inner product using those covariant derivatives, which rely on the connection. But since M is a Riemannian manifold, the connection is given. So perhaps the assumption is that M has a Riemannian metric and the corresponding Levi-Civita connection, but the problem might assume that's understood.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the assumptions are as follows:\n\nAssumption:\n- M is a Riemannian manifold with Riemannian metric ⟨ , ⟩_p at each point p ∈ M.\n- TM is the tangent bundle of M.\n- (p, v) is a point in TM.\n- V and W are tangent vectors to TM at (p, v).\n- α: (-ε, ε) → TM is a curve defined by α(t) = (p(t), v(t)).\n- β: (-ε, ε) → TM is a curve defined by β(s) = (q(s), w(s)).\n- p(0) = q(0) = p.\n- v(0) = w(0) = v.\n- V = α’(0).\n- W = β’(0).\n- π: TM → M is the canonical projection map.\n- The covariant derivatives Dv/dt(0) and Dw/ds(0) are computed using the Levi-Civita connection of M.\n\nBut again, the problem may not explicitly mention the Levi-Civita connection. The user's example didn't include implicit assumptions beyond what's stated. Therefore, perhaps the connection is part of the structure of M being Riemannian, so we don't need to list it separately.\n\nIn the original problem statement, the user is to prove that the defined inner product is a well-defined Riemannian metric. The key points are that the inner product doesn't depend on the choice of curves α and β, and that it satisfies the properties of a Riemannian metric (symmetric, bilinear, positive definite).\n\nSo, in the assumptions, we need to include all the given data:\n\n- M is a Riemannian manifold.\n- TM is its tangent bundle.\n- Points (p, v) in TM.\n- Tangent vectors V, W at (p, v).\n- Curves α, β with specific initial conditions.\n- The inner product is defined as the sum of the projections and covariant derivatives.\n\nEach of these should be a separate assumption. However, some may be redundant. For example, \"V and W are tangent vectors to TM at (p, v)\" can be split into two: one for V, one for W. But maybe as one line.\n\nBut following the example, where each line is one property for one object, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- M is a Riemannian manifold.\n- TM is the tangent bundle of M.\n- (p, v) is a point in TM.\n- V is a tangent vector to TM at (p, v).\n- W is a tangent vector to TM at (p, v).\n- α: t ↦ (p(t), v(t)) is a curve in TM.\n- β: s ↦ (q(s), w(s)) is a curve in TM.\n- α(0) = (p, v).\n- β(0) = (p, v).\n- V is the derivative of α at t=0.\n- W is the derivative of β at s=0.\n- π: TM → M is the projection map.\n- The covariant derivatives Dv/dt(0) and Dw/ds(0) are defined.\n\nNow, checking if each assumption is a single property for one object. For example, \"M is a Riemannian manifold\" is one property. \"TM is the tangent bundle of M\" is another. Each curve's condition (α(0) = (p, v)) is separate. The derivatives being V and W are separate.\n\nYes, each bullet is a single condition. So that's 12 assumptions. But maybe some can be combined. For example, \"α: t ↦ (p(t), v(t)) is a curve in TM\" and \"α(0) = (p, v)\" could be two separate assumptions, which is okay.\n\nSo, final answer:",
