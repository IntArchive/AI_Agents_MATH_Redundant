    "Content": "Let $M$ be a differentiable manifold with cotangent bundle $T^*M$. How can I prove that $T_{(p,0)}T^*M$ is naturally isomorphic to $T_pM\\oplus T_pM^*$? If this true, then I think I could prove that the Hessian of $f\\colon M\\to \\mathbb{R}$ is well-defined (I mean, without choice of Connection or Riemannian metric) at critical point of $f$.

    "AcceptedAnswer": "Things are much nicer i.e. more general and canonical than that! a) Let $\\pi:N\\to M$ be a submersion of manifolds. From it you obtain the exact sequence of vector bundles on $N$ : $$     0\\to  T^{vert}(N) \\to   T(N) \\stackrel {d\\pi}{\\to} \\pi^{-1}T(M)  \\to   0  \\quad (*)       $$ Profound, eh? Not at all! This is just a fancy way of looking at the differential of the map $\\pi: N\\to M.$ In order that both the tangent bundles to $N$ and to $M$ live on $N$ , you have to pull back $T(M)$ to $N$ : that is why we have $\\pi^{-1} T(M)$ on the right. The kernel is the set of vertical tangent vectors to $N$ , those that lie along the level lines $N[n]\\stackrel {def}{=}\\pi^{-1}(\\pi (n))$ of $\\pi$ . In other words at a point $n\\in N$ the fibre  of $T^{vert}(N)$ is $$T^{vert}_n(N)=T_n(N[n])   \\quad (**)$$ b) Consider now a vector bundle $\\pi:V\\to M$ on $M$ . You then have the canonical exact sequence of vector bundles on $V\\;$ (yes, vector bundles on a vector bundle!) : $$   0\\to  T^{vert}(V) \\to   T(V) \\stackrel {d\\pi}{\\to} \\pi^{-1}T(M)  \\to   0 \\quad (***)$$ In this new set-up you have the interesting identification $ T^{vert}(V)=\\pi^{-1}(V)$ . This boils down to the fact that the tangent space at any point $e\\in E$ of a vector space $E$ is that vector space itself: $T_e(E)=E.$ Hence $(***)$ becomes $$        0\\to  \\pi^{-1}(V) \\to   T(V) \\stackrel {d\\pi}{\\to} \\pi^{-1}T(M)  \\to   0 \\quad (****)              $$ c) Finally, if you restrict this last exact sequence (****) to the zero section of $V$ , identified to $M$ , you get $$     0\\to  V \\to   T(V)|M \\stackrel {d\\pi}{\\to} T(M)  \\to   0 \\quad   \\quad (*****) $$ d) Although this is not very helpful, you can if the manifold $M$ is paracompact (see here ) non-canonically split the exact sequence  (*****) and obtain the isomorphism $$ T(V)|M \\cong  V \\oplus T(M)$$ At a point $(m,0)\\in M\\subset V$ this gives the decomposition $$ T_{(m,0)}(V) \\cong  V_m \\oplus T_m(M)$$ and for $V=T^*(M)$ this is what you were looking for.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants to prove that the tangent space at the zero section of the cotangent bundle, specifically at a point (p,0), is naturally isomorphic to the direct sum of the tangent space at p and the cotangent space at p. So, T_{(p,0)}T^*M ≅ T_pM ⊕ T_pM^*. \n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic concepts about tangent bundles and cotangent bundles. The cotangent bundle T^*M is the union of all cotangent spaces at points p in M, so each point in T^*M is a pair (p, α) where α is a covector at p. The zero section would be the set of points (p, 0) where the covector is the zero covector.\n\nNow, the tangent space to the cotangent bundle at a point (p,0) should somehow combine the tangent vectors to the base manifold M and the tangent vectors to the fiber at p, which is the cotangent space T_p^*M. But how exactly?\n\nWhen we think of the tangent bundle of a vector bundle, like T^*M, the tangent space at a point in the bundle splits into a horizontal part (related to the base manifold) and a vertical part (related to the fiber). In the case of the zero section, the point (p,0) is in the base, so maybe the horizontal part corresponds to T_pM and the vertical part corresponds to T_p^*M? But wait, the vertical tangent vectors at (p,0) should be related to the fiber, which is T_p^*M. However, the tangent space to the fiber T_p^*M can be identified with T_p^*M itself because the fiber is a vector space. So, putting that together, T_{(p,0)}T^*M should be isomorphic to T_pM ⊕ T_p^*M.\n\nBut how do we make this natural? Naturality usually means that the isomorphism doesn't depend on any arbitrary choices, like a connection or a metric. The user mentioned wanting to define the Hessian without such choices, which aligns with this idea.\n\nAnother approach is to use coordinates. Let’s choose local coordinates around p in M, say x^i. Then, the cotangent bundle T^*M has coordinates (x^i, ξ_j), where ξ_j are the coordinates for the covectors. At the point (p,0), the coordinates are (x^i, 0). The tangent space at this point would have basis vectors ∂/∂x^i and ∂/∂ξ_j. The first set, ∂/∂x^i, would correspond to the tangent vectors in T_pM, and the second set, ∂/∂ξ_j, since they are tangent to the fiber, which is a vector space, can be identified with the cotangent vectors themselves. Thus, the tangent space T_{(p,0)}T^*M would split into T_pM ⊕ T_p^*M naturally via these coordinate vector fields. This seems to work without any connection or metric.\n\nWait, but in general, without coordinates, how does this splitting occur? The key is that at the zero section, the vertical component (from the fiber) is naturally a covector because the fiber is a vector space, and its tangent space at the origin can be identified with the vector space itself. For the horizontal component, even without a connection, the zero section gives a canonical way to lift tangent vectors from the base. Because the zero section is an embedding of M into T^*M, its derivative at p would inject T_pM into T_{(p,0)}T^*M. So combining these two, we get the direct sum.\n\nTherefore, the natural isomorphism comes from the splitting into horizontal (from the zero section) and vertical (from the fiber) tangent vectors, which don't require any additional structure like a connection. This would mean the Hessian, which involves second derivatives, can be defined using this splitting since at a critical point, the first derivatives vanish, and the second derivatives can be captured by this tangent space decomposition.",
