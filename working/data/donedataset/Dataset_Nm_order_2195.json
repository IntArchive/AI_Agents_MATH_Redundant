    "Content": "Given $a>b>2$ both positive integers, which of $a^b$ and $b^a$ is larger? I tried an induction approach. First I showed that if $b=3$ then any $a \\geq4$ satisfied $a^b<b^a$. Then using that as my base case I tried to show that given any pair of positive integers $a,b$ satisfying $a>b>2$ and $a^b<b^a$, then $(a+1)^{b+1}<(b+1)^{a+1}$ - but that is where I got stuck. Any help would be appreciated.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The result follows easily using calculus. Here's an elementary approach, which uses the fact that $a, b$ are positive integers. Consider $n \\geq 3$. Then \n$$(n+1)^n=\\sum_{i=0}^{n}{\\binom{n}{i}n^{n-i}}=1+n^2+\\sum_{i=0}^{n-2}{\\binom{n}{i}n^{n-i}}<n^n+\\sum_{i=0}^{n-2}{n^n}=n^{n+1}$$ since $\\binom{n}{i} \\leq n^i$, and $1+n^2<n^n$ for $n \\geq 3$. Therefore $n^{\\frac{1}{n}}>(n+1)^{\\frac{1}{n+1}}$ for $n \\geq 3$. This immediately implies that $a^{\\frac{1}{a}}<b^{\\frac{1}{b}}$, so $a^b<b^a$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The question is: Given two positive integers a and b where a > b > 2, which is larger between a^b and b^a?\n\nThe user mentioned trying induction. They started with b=3 and showed that for a ≥4, a^3 < 3^a. Then tried to induct on a and b, increasing both by 1 each time, but got stuck. Hmm.\n\nFirst, let me recall some examples. Let's take b=3. For a=4: 4^3 =64 vs 3^4=81. So 64 <81. a=5:5^3=125 vs 3^5=243. Still a^b <b^a. a=6:6^3=216 vs3^6=729. So same pattern. So for b=3, a^b <b^a when a>3.\n\nWhat if b=4? Take a=5: 5^4=625 vs4^5=1024. So 625 <1024. a=6:6^4=1296 vs4^6=4096. Still a^b <b^a. How about a=4? But the condition is a >b>2, so a can't be 4 if b=4. So for b=4, a=5,6,... same result.\n\nWait, but what about when a and b are closer? Like a=5, b=4? As above, 5^4=625 <4^5=1024. But what if a=4 and b=3? 4^3=64 <3^4=81. So same. Hmm. Maybe for all a >b > e (Euler's number?), but since a and b are integers, maybe after a certain point.\n\nWait, in real numbers, the function x^y vs y^x. The comparison depends on whether (ln x)/x > (ln y)/y. Since the function f(x)=ln x /x increases up to x=e and then decreases. So if a >b >e, then (ln a)/a < (ln b)/b, so a^b <b^a. But since here a and b are integers greater than 2. e is approximately 2.718, so for integers, b >=3. So if a >b >=3, then a^b <b^a. But wait, but when a and b are equal, they are equal. But in the problem, a >b.\n\nBut wait, wait. Let's take a=4 and b=3. 4^3=64 vs3^4=81. So a^b <b^a. Similarly, a=5, b=4: 5^4=625 vs4^5=1024. Again a^b <b^a. If a=3 and b=2: 3^2=9 vs2^3=8. Here a^b >b^a. But in the problem, b>2. So starting from b=3. So maybe for all integers a >b >2, a^b <b^a. Is that the case?\n\nWait, but let's check a=5 and b=2: 5^2=25 vs2^5=32. Here a=5, b=2: a^b=25 <32=b^a. But in the problem, b>2, so b=3,4,...\n\nWait, but in the problem, both a and b are greater than 2, so b is at least 3. Then, according to the examples, when a >b >=3, a^b <b^a. So the answer would be that b^a is larger. But is this always true?\n\nWait, let's check a=4 and b=3: 64 vs81. a^b <b^a. a=5, b=3:125 vs243. Same. a=6, b=3:216 vs729. Same. a=5, b=4:625 vs1024. Same. a=6, b=4:1296 vs4096. a=6, b=5: 6^5=7776 vs5^6=15625. So yes, same pattern.\n\nBut wait, what about larger numbers? Let's say a=10, b=9: 10^9 vs9^10. 10^9=1,000,000,000. 9^10=348,678,4401. So 1e9 <3.486e9. So 10^9 <9^10. Similarly, a=100, b=99. 100^99 vs99^100. Clearly, 99^100 is much larger. Because 100^99 = (99+1)^99, while 99^100=99*99^99. So 99^100=99*(99^99), and 100^99 = (99+1)^99. Using binomial theorem, (99+1)^99 ≈99^99 +99*99^98 + ... But even then, 99^100 is 99 times 99^99, while 100^99 is roughly 99^99*(1 + 99/99 + ...) but not sure. Wait, perhaps taking the ratio: (99^100)/(100^99) =99*(99/100)^99 =99*(0.99)^99. Since (0.99)^99 ≈1/e^{99/100}≈1/e^{0.99}≈1/2.7 ≈0.37. So 99*0.37 ≈36.63. So 99^100 ≈36.63*100^99. So 99^100 is larger. Therefore, even for large a and b with a >b, b^a is larger.\n\nBut is there a case where a >b >2 and a^b >b^a? Let me check small numbers. Wait, when a=3, b=2:3^2=9 vs2^3=8. Here a^b >b^a. But in the problem, b>2. So when b=3, a=4,5,... we saw a^b <b^a. So seems like for all a >b >=3, a^b <b^a. Therefore, the answer would be that b^a is larger.\n\nBut how to prove this? The user tried induction. They fixed b=3 and showed for a>=4, a^3 <3^a. Then tried to induct on a and b. But got stuck. Maybe induction is not the easiest way here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use calculus. For real numbers x>y>e, is x^y < y^x? As I thought earlier, since f(x)=ln x /x is decreasing for x>e. Therefore, if x>y>e, then ln x /x <ln y /y, so (ln x)/x < (ln y)/y => y ln x <x ln y => ln x^y <ln y^x =>x^y <y^x. So for real numbers, yes. Since integers a and b greater than 2, then for b>=3, and a >b, then since 3>e≈2.718, so if b>=3, which is greater than e, then as a >b, and since f(x)=ln x /x is decreasing for x>e, then a^b <b^a. Therefore, the conclusion holds.\n\nBut the problem is about positive integers a >b >2. Therefore, the answer should be that b^a is larger. So the problem is to prove that for integers a >b >2, b^a >a^b.\n\nBut how to structure the assumptions and problem as per the required format.\n\nLooking at the example given, the user's original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, even though in the original problem statement it was for every integer n. Wait, in the example, the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which doesn't require n to be divisible by 7. Wait, perhaps the example might have a typo? Wait, no. Wait, the example's original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, the assumption is that n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems contradictory. Because if n must be divisible by 7, then it's not for every integer n. Hmm, maybe the example was modified or perhaps the original problem had an error, but according to the user's example, the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. So maybe in that case, the user made a mistake in the example. But regardless, the task is to structure the current problem.\n\nThe current problem is: Given a >b >2 both positive integers, which of a^b and b^a is larger?\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n- a and b are positive integers.\n\n- a > b.\n\n- b >2.\n\nEach assumption is one line, each applies to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\n\na and b are positive integers,\n\na is greater than b,\n\nb is greater than 2.\n\nProblem: Determine which of a^b and b^a is larger.\n\nBut wait, the original problem's user tried induction, starting with b=3, showing that for a >=4, a^3 <3^a, then tried to induct on a and b. So the problem is to determine which is larger, given a >b >2. The answer is that b^a is larger, but the user is asking for help in proving it, possibly via induction or another method.\n\nBut in terms of formatting, according to the example, assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\n\na and b are positive integers,\n\na is greater than b,\n\nb is greater than 2.\n\nProblem: Determine which of a^b and b^a is larger.\n\nOr maybe more precisely: Prove that for positive integers a and b with a > b >2, b^a is larger than a^b.\n\nBut the original question says \"which of a^b and b^a is larger?\" So the problem is to determine which is larger, but from the examples and the analysis, the answer is that b^a is larger. But the problem is posed as a question to be proven, not a multiple-choice. So the problem is to show that b^a >a^b under the given assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have assumptions as above, and the problem is to prove that b^a >a^b.",
