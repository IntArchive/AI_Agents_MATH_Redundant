    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that for positive real numbers a, b, c, the sum of these three fractions is less than 2. The original approach they tried was to show each term is less than 1, but that only gives a sum less than 3, which is not tight enough. So, we need a better approach here.\n\nFirst, let me parse the problem again: Prove that (a²/(a² + bc)) + (b²/(b² + ac)) + (c²/(c² + ab)) < 2, given a, b, c are positive real numbers. The user mentioned avoiding cyclic sums for clarity.\n\nHmm, maybe I should consider some inequality techniques. Since all variables are positive, perhaps Cauchy-Schwarz or the Titu's lemma (which is a form of Cauchy-Schwarz) could be useful here. Alternatively, maybe manipulating each term to find a common structure.\n\nWait, let's see each term: a²/(a² + bc). If I can relate this to something else. Maybe subtract each term from 1 to get bc/(a² + bc). Then the sum of (1 - a²/(a² + bc)) would be sum of bc/(a² + bc). So the original sum S = 3 - sum(bc/(a² + bc)). So, if we can show that sum(bc/(a² + bc)) > 1, then S < 2.\n\nBut how to show that sum(bc/(a² + bc)) >1? Maybe using Cauchy-Schwarz? Let me think. Let's denote each denominator as a² + bc. If I consider the sum of bc/(a² + bc), perhaps apply Cauchy-Schwarz on the numerators and denominators.\n\nAlternatively, maybe homogenize the inequality. Since the inequality is homogeneous, perhaps assume that a + b + c = 1 or another normalization. Wait, but the problem states a, b, c are positive reals, so maybe we can set some variables equal or use substitution.\n\nAlternatively, consider using the Nesbitt's inequality or similar, but I don't recall Nesbitt's exactly here. Alternatively, maybe compare each term to something else. For example, since bc ≤ (b + c)^2 /4 by AM-GM, but not sure if that helps.\n\nWait, another idea: cross-multiplying terms. Let me consider the sum:\n\n(a²)/(a² + bc) + (b²)/(b² + ac) + (c²)/(c² + ab).\n\nIf I can manipulate each fraction. Let's try to write each denominator as a² + bc. Maybe add and subtract terms. For example, write the first term as (a² + bc - bc)/(a² + bc) = 1 - bc/(a² + bc). Then the entire sum becomes 3 - [bc/(a² + bc) + ac/(b² + ac) + ab/(c² + ab)]. So, the original sum is 3 minus that other sum. Therefore, to prove that the original sum is less than 2, we need to show that [bc/(a² + bc) + ac/(b² + ac) + ab/(c² + ab)] > 1.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to proving that the sum of bc/(a² + bc) + ac/(b² + ac) + ab/(c² + ab) is greater than 1. Maybe this is easier to handle. Let's see.\n\nTo prove that sum bc/(a² + bc) >1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use Cauchy-Schwarz inequality on this sum. Let's consider the sum as Σ (bc)/(a² + bc). Let's apply Cauchy-Schwarz in the form:\n\n[Σ (bc)/(a² + bc)] [Σ (bc)(a² + bc)] ≥ (Σ bc)^2.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, perhaps invert the terms. Alternatively, note that bc/(a² + bc) = 1/( (a²)/bc + 1 ). Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's consider using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in the following form:\n\nΣ [bc/(a² + bc)] ≥ [ (Σ sqrt(bc) )² ] / [ Σ (a² + bc) ]\n\nBut not sure. Let's compute denominator Σ (a² + bc) = a² + b² + c² + bc + ac + ab.\n\nThe numerator would be (sqrt(bc) + sqrt(ac) + sqrt(ab))² = ab + bc + ac + 2(a sqrt(bc) + b sqrt(ac) + c sqrt(ab))... Hmm, this might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the fact that bc/(a² + bc) ≥ bc/(a² + b² + c²). Wait, no, because denominator a² + bc ≤ a² + b² + c² only if bc ≤ b² + c², which is true by AM-GM (since b² + c² ≥ 2bc). Therefore, a² + bc ≤ a² + (b² + c²)/2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to assume symmetry. Suppose a = b = c. Let's test the case where a = b = c = 1. Then each term is 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2. So the sum would be 3*(1/2) = 3/2 < 2, which satisfies the inequality. So equality case when variables are equal gives sum 1.5. But the problem says less than 2. So, perhaps the maximum of this sum is approaching 2 when one variable is very large compared to others.\n\nWait, let's test another case: let a approach infinity, and b, c approach 0. For example, let a be very large, b = c = 1/a. Then compute each term:\n\nFirst term: a²/(a² + bc) = a²/(a² + (1/a)(1/a)) = a²/(a² + 1/a²) ≈ 1 as a is large.\n\nSecond term: b²/(b² + ac) = (1/a²)/(1/a² + a*(1/a)) = (1/a²)/(1/a² + 1) ≈ 0 as a is large.\n\nThird term: same as second term, ≈ 0.\n\nSo the sum approaches 1 + 0 + 0 = 1 < 2. So that's okay. Wait, but the problem states sum < 2. So when variables are very unequal, sum approaches 1. When variables are equal, sum is 1.5. So where does the sum approach 2?\n\nWait, maybe when two variables are very large and one is small? Let's take a and b large, c small.\n\nLet a = b = t, c approaching 0. Then:\n\nFirst term: a²/(a² + bc) = t²/(t² + t*0) = 1.\n\nSecond term: b²/(b² + ac) = t²/(t² + t*0) = 1.\n\nThird term: c²/(c² + ab) = 0/(0 + t²) = 0.\n\nSo sum is 1 + 1 + 0 = 2. But the problem says sum < 2. So in this case, when c approaches 0, the sum approaches 2. But the problem states strict inequality. Therefore, the maximum of the sum is approaching 2 but never actually reaching it. Hence, the inequality is strict.\n\nTherefore, the problem requires proving that the sum is always less than 2 for positive real numbers a, b, c. So, perhaps approaching this via considering the limit cases and then using some inequality to show that it's always strictly less than 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality on each term. Let me consider each term a²/(a² + bc). Let's write it as (a^2)/(a^2 + bc) = 1/(1 + bc/a²). Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, another idea: Maybe use the fact that (a²)/(a² + bc) < (a² + bc)/(a² + bc + something). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider adding up the fractions. Let's consider the sum:\n\nS = Σ a²/(a² + bc)\n\nWe need to show S < 2.\n\nLet me try to manipulate the inequality:\n\nWe want to show that Σ [a²/(a² + bc)] < 2.\n\nMultiply each term by the denominators:\n\nBut cross-multiplying would be complicated. Alternatively, consider subtracting from 2:\n\n2 - Σ [a²/(a² + bc)] > 0\n\nWhich is 2 - S = 2 - [a²/(a² + bc) + b²/(b² + ac) + c²/(c² + ab)]\n\nBut how to express this? Maybe as:\n\n2 - S = [ (a² + bc)/(a² + bc) + (b² + ac)/(b² + ac) + (c² + ab)/(c² + ab) ] - [a²/(a² + bc) + b²/(b² + ac) + c²/(c² + ab) ]\n\nWait, no, that's just 3 - S. But 2 - S = (3 - S) -1. So 2 - S = (sum of bc/(a² + bc)) -1. Therefore, we need to show that sum bc/(a² + bc) >1, which would imply that 2 - S >0, i.e., S <2.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to proving that sum bc/(a² + bc) >1.\n\nSo now, how to show that sum bc/(a² + bc) >1.\n\nMaybe use Cauchy-Schwarz here. Let's recall that for positive reals, sum (x_i/y_i) ≥ (sum x_i)^2 / sum (x_i y_i). But in our case, it's sum (bc)/(a² + bc). Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, apply Cauchy-Schwarz in the following form:\n\n[Σ (bc)/(a² + bc)] [Σ (bc + a²)] ≥ [Σ sqrt(bc)]^2.\n\nBut not sure if this helps. Alternatively, consider the following substitution: Let x = a², y = b², z = c². Then bc = sqrt(y z). So the sum becomes sqrt(y z)/(x + sqrt(y z)) + sqrt(x z)/(y + sqrt(x z)) + sqrt(x y)/(z + sqrt(x y)). Hmm, maybe this is more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, consider the substitution where a = 1/x, b = 1/y, c = 1/z, but not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: Use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality on each term. For each term bc/(a² + bc), we can write it as (bc)/(a² + bc). Let's think of numerator and denominator. If we have sum (bc)/(a² + bc) ≥ something.\n\nAlternatively, use the substitution variables: Let’s set x = a, y = b, z = c. Then perhaps we can assume some ordering like a ≥ b ≥ c. But not sure.\n\nWait, here's an idea from the classic inequalities. Let's consider the following:\n\nUsing the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, sum [ bc/(a² + bc) ] ≥ [ (sum sqrt(bc) )^2 ] / [ sum (a² + bc) ]\n\nLet’s compute this. The left-hand side (LHS) of the inequality is sum [ bc/(a² + bc) ]. By Cauchy-Schwarz:\n\nsum [ bc/(a² + bc) ] ≥ [ (sqrt(bc) + sqrt(ac) + sqrt(ab) )^2 ] / [ sum (a² + bc) ]\n\nNow, compute the numerator:\n\n( sqrt(bc) + sqrt(ac) + sqrt(ab) )^2 = ab + bc + ac + 2( a sqrt(bc) + b sqrt(ac) + c sqrt(ab) )\n\nThe denominator is sum (a² + bc) = a² + b² + c² + ab + bc + ac\n\nSo, we have:\n\nsum [ bc/(a² + bc) ] ≥ [ ab + bc + ac + 2( a sqrt(bc) + b sqrt(ac) + c sqrt(ab) ) ] / (a² + b² + c² + ab + bc + ac )\n\nNow, to show that this is greater than 1, we need:\n\nab + bc + ac + 2( a sqrt(bc) + b sqrt(ac) + c sqrt(ab) ) ≥ a² + b² + c² + ab + bc + ac\n\nSubtracting ab + bc + ac from both sides:\n\n2( a sqrt(bc) + b sqrt(ac) + c sqrt(ab) ) ≥ a² + b² + c²\n\nBut this is not generally true. For example, if a = b = c =1, then LHS is 2(1 +1 +1) =6 and RHS is 3. So 6 ≥3, which holds. But if a=2, b=1, c=1, then LHS= 2(2*sqrt(1*1) +1*sqrt(2*1)+1*sqrt(2*1))= 2(2 + sqrt(2) + sqrt(2))=2*(2 + 2sqrt(2))=4 +4sqrt(2)≈4+5.656=9.656, and RHS=4 +1 +1=6. Still holds. But what if a is very large and b,c are small? Let's take a approaching infinity, b,c approaching 0. Then LHS≈2*a*sqrt(0) +...≈0, and RHS≈a², which is much larger. So this inequality does not hold in that case. Hence, our approach using Cauchy-Schwarz here gives a lower bound that's not always sufficient. Therefore, this path might not work.\n\nHmm, maybe another idea. Let's consider the substitution where a = x, b = y, c = z. But not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe use the fact that bc/(a² + bc) = 1/( (a²)/bc +1 ). Then, using the AM ≥ GM inequality, since a²/bc +1 ≥ 2a/sqrt(bc). But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider the following identity or manipulation. Let’s think about Nesbitt's inequality, which states that for positive a, b, c, (a/(b + c) + b/(a + c) + c/(a + b)) ≥ 3/2. But not directly applicable here.\n\nWait, here's a different approach: Let’s use the following inequality for positive real numbers:\n\nFor any positive x, y, we have x/(x + y) < x/(x + y - sqrt(xy))\n\nWait, not sure. Alternatively, consider comparing each term to a/(a + sqrt(bc)).\n\nWait, maybe use the substitution t = sqrt(bc)/a. Then bc = a² t². So the term becomes a²/(a² + a² t²) = 1/(1 + t²). But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider that bc ≤ (b + c)^2 /4 by AM-GM. Then, a² + bc ≥ a² + (b + c)^2 /4. Then, bc/(a² + bc) ≤ bc/[a² + (b + c)^2 /4]. But this might not help.\n\nWait, another thought: Let’s consider the original sum S = Σ a²/(a² + bc). We need S <2. Let's subtract each term from 1, so 1 - a²/(a² + bc) = bc/(a² + bc). So sum of these is Σ bc/(a² + bc) = 3 - S. Therefore, we need 3 - S >1 → S <2. So, we need to show that Σ bc/(a² + bc) >1.\n\nThus, the problem is equivalent to proving Σ bc/(a² + bc) >1.\n\nSo, how to show Σ bc/(a² + bc) >1. Let's think of T = Σ bc/(a² + bc). Need to show T >1.\n\nLet’s consider the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality again but in a different form. For positive reals, we have:\n\nΣ [ bc/(a² + bc) ] ≥ [ (Σ bc )^2 ] / [ Σ bc(a² + bc) ]\n\nCompute numerator: (Σ bc)^2 = (ab + bc + ca)^2.\n\nDenominator: Σ bc(a² + bc) = a² bc + b² ac + c² ab + (bc)^2 + (ac)^2 + (ab)^2.\n\n= abc(a + b + c) + (ab)^2 + (bc)^2 + (ca)^2.\n\nHmm, complicated. So the inequality would be T ≥ (ab + bc + ca)^2 / [abc(a + b + c) + (ab)^2 + (bc)^2 + (ca)^2 ].\n\nWe need to show that this is greater than 1. So,\n\n(ab + bc + ca)^2 ≥ abc(a + b + c) + (ab)^2 + (bc)^2 + (ca)^2.\n\nExpand left side: (ab)^2 + (bc)^2 + (ca)^2 + 2ab*bc + 2bc*ca + 2ca*ab.\n\nSo LHS - RHS = 2abc(a + b + c). Therefore, (ab + bc + ca)^2 = RHS + 2abc(a + b + c). Therefore,\n\n(ab + bc + ca)^2 / [RHS] = 1 + [2abc(a + b + c)] / [RHS].\n\nBut since RHS = abc(a + b + c) + (ab)^2 + (bc)^2 + (ca)^2, which is less than (ab + bc + ca)^2 as shown above. Therefore, the ratio is greater than 1, hence T ≥ something greater than 1.\n\nWait, but this seems like:\n\nT ≥ (ab + bc + ca)^2 / [ abc(a + b + c) + (ab)^2 + (bc)^2 + (ca)^2 ] = [ (ab + bc + ca)^2 ] / [ (ab)^2 + (bc)^2 + (ca)^2 + abc(a + b + c) ]\n\nBut we know that (ab + bc + ca)^2 = (ab)^2 + (bc)^2 + (ca)^2 + 2abc(a + b + c)\n\nTherefore, denominator = (ab)^2 + (bc)^2 + (ca)^2 + abc(a + b + c) = (ab + bc + ca)^2 - 2abc(a + b + c) + abc(a + b + c) = (ab + bc + ca)^2 - abc(a + b + c)\n\nThus, the ratio becomes [ (ab + bc + ca)^2 ] / [ (ab + bc + ca)^2 - abc(a + b + c) ]\n\nSo, T ≥ (ab + bc + ca)^2 / [ (ab + bc + ca)^2 - abc(a + b + c) ] = 1 / [1 - abc(a + b + c)/(ab + bc + ca)^2 ]\n\nThis expression is greater than 1 because the denominator is less than 1. Therefore, T is greater than 1 divided by something less than 1, which means T >1. Hence, the inequality holds. Therefore, sum bc/(a² + bc) >1, so original sum S =3 - T <2. Therefore, proved.\n\nWait, but is this valid? Let me check.\n\nGiven that:\n\nΣ bc/(a² + bc) ≥ [ (ab + bc + ca)^2 ] / [ (ab)^2 + (bc)^2 + (ca)^2 + abc(a + b + c) ]\n\nAnd we showed that denominator = (ab + bc + ca)^2 - abc(a + b + c)\n\nSo the inequality is:\n\nΣ bc/(a² + bc) ≥ (ab + bc + ca)^2 / [ (ab + bc + ca)^2 - abc(a + b + c) ]\n\nLet’s denote D = (ab + bc + ca)^2 - abc(a + b + c)\n\nThen, Σ bc/(a² + bc) ≥ (ab + bc + ca)^2 / D\n\nBut since D = (ab + bc + ca)^2 - abc(a + b + c), so (ab + bc + ca)^2 = D + abc(a + b + c)\n\nThus,\n\nΣ bc/(a² + bc) ≥ [D + abc(a + b + c)] / D = 1 + [ abc(a + b + c) / D ]\n\nSince abc(a + b + c) >0 and D >0 (as ab, bc, ca are positive), this implies that the RHS is greater than 1. Therefore, Σ bc/(a² + bc) ≥ something greater than 1, which implies that Σ bc/(a² + bc) >1. Hence, proved.\n\nTherefore, this shows that the original sum S =3 - Σ bc/(a² + bc) <3 -1=2. Hence, the inequality holds.\n\nBut wait, this seems to use Cauchy-Schwarz in a specific way. Let me verify the application of Cauchy-Schwarz.\n\nThe Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for positive reals u_i and v_i,\n\n(Σ u_i v_i)^2 ≤ (Σ u_i²)(Σ v_i²)\n\nBut in our case, we applied it in the form:\n\nΣ (x_i / y_i ) ≥ (Σ x_i )² / Σ (x_i y_i )\n\nWhich is a valid form. Let me confirm:\n\nLet’s set u_i = sqrt(x_i) and v_i = sqrt(x_i)/y_i. Then,\n\n(Σ x_i / y_i ) ≥ (Σ x_i )² / Σ (x_i y_i )\n\nThis is the Cauchy-Schwarz in the form Σ (a_i^2) Σ (b_i^2) ≥ (Σ a_i b_i )^2.\n\nLet me set a_i = sqrt(x_i) and b_i = sqrt(x_i)/sqrt(y_i). Then,\n\nΣ (a_i^2) = Σ x_i\n\nΣ (b_i^2) = Σ (x_i / y_i )\n\nThe product Σ a_i^2 Σ b_i^2 = (Σ x_i)(Σ x_i / y_i )\n\nThe cross term (Σ a_i b_i )^2 = (Σ x_i / sqrt(y_i) )^2\n\nBut not sure. Alternatively, using the Titu's lemma which states that Σ (x_i^2 / y_i ) ≥ (Σ x_i )² / Σ y_i.\n\nWait, but in our case, it's Σ (x_i / y_i ), and Titu's lemma requires squares in the numerator. Hmm, maybe the application isn't directly correct.\n\nWait, let me correct this. Titu's lemma is for Σ (a_i^2 / b_i ) ≥ (Σ a_i )² / Σ b_i. So if we set a_i = sqrt(bc) and b_i = a² + bc, then Σ (bc/(a² + bc)) = Σ ( (sqrt(bc))^2 / (a² + bc) ) ≥ (Σ sqrt(bc) )² / Σ (a² + bc). Which is what we did earlier. So that part is correct.\n\nTherefore, the application is valid. Therefore, the conclusion holds, hence Σ bc/(a² + bc) >1, so S <2. Therefore, the inequality is proved.\n\nThus, the answer to the problem is using this approach, transforming the original sum and applying Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to the transformed terms.",
