    "Content": "I stumbled upon this proof of $\\pi$ being rational (coincidentally, it's Pi Day). Of course I know that $\\pi$ is irrational and there have been multiple proofs of this, but I can't seem to see a flaw in the following proof that I found here . I'm assuming it will be blatantly obvious to people here, so I was hoping someone could point it out. Thanks. Proof: We will prove that pi is, in fact, a rational number, by induction on\n  the number of decimal places, N, to which it is approximated. For\n  small values of N, say 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, this is the case as 3, 3.1,\n  3.14, 3.142, and 3.1416 are, in fact, rational numbers. To prove the rationality of pi by induction, assume that an N-digit approximation\n  of pi is rational. This number can be expressed as the fraction\n  M/(10^N). Multiplying our approximation to pi, with N digits to the\n  right of the decimal place, by (10^N) yields the integer M. Adding the\n  next significant digit to pi can be said to involve multiplying both\n  numerator and denominator by 10 and adding a number between between -5\n  and +5 (approximation) to the numerator. Since both (10^(N+1)) and\n  (M*10+A) for A between -5 and 5 are integers, the (N+1)-digit\n  approximation of pi is also rational. One can also see that adding one\n  digit to the decimal representation of a rational number, without loss\n  of generality, does not make an irrational number. Therefore, by\n  induction on the number of decimal places, pi is rational. Q.E.D.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let's apply this technique to a more transparent question. CLAIM : $0.333\\ldots < 1/3$ Proof : We induct on the number of decimal digits. Clearly, $0.3 < 1/3$. Now, by induction, if $n$ digits of $0.333\\ldots 3 < 1/3$, than in particular $3 \\cdot 0.333\\ldots3 = 0.999\\ldots900 < 1$, and so $0.999\\ldots 990$ (i.e. with one more $9$ digit) $<1$, and thus it holds for $n+1$ as well. So by induction, the claim is proven. What's wrong with this? Induction is a proof for all natural numbers, not for $\\infty$. It's clear that $0.333\\ldots = 1/3$. But any finite decimal representation is less than $1/3$. And the induction only shows that any finite decimal representation is, in fact, less than $1/3$. This is the same flaw at the heart of the $\\pi$ rational argument.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question according to the specified structure. First, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement from the original question.\n\nThe original problem is about proving that π is rational using an induction argument. The user provided a detailed proof attempt. My job is to filter out the unrelated information and structure it as per the example.\n\nFirst, I'll list the assumptions. The proof uses induction on the number of decimal places N. The base cases are N=0,1,2,3,4, which are rational. The inductive step assumes an N-digit approximation is rational (M/10^N), then adding the next digit keeps it rational because it's (M*10 + A)/10^(N+1) where A is between -5 and 5. Also, the argument states that adding a digit to a rational number's decimal doesn't make it irrational.\n\nSo each assumption should be a single line, addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let's break them down:\n\n1. For small values of N (0,1,2,3,4), the approximations of π are rational.\n2. An N-digit approximation of π is rational and can be expressed as M/(10^N).\n3. Adding the next significant digit involves multiplying numerator and denominator by 10 and adding A (between -5 and +5) to the numerator.\n4. Both 10^(N+1) and (M*10 + A) are integers.\n5. Adding one digit to the decimal representation of a rational number does not make it irrational.\n\nThese are the key assumptions made in the inductive proof. The problem statement is to prove that π is rational using this induction approach. I need to present this concisely in the specified format, making sure each assumption is a separate line and the problem is clearly stated.",
