    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to help structure this problem according to the given format. Let me start by reading the original question carefully.\n\nThe problem is titled \"Prove |P(0)| ≤ 2n+1\". The question states: Let P(x) be a polynomial with degree ≤ n and |P(x)| ≤ 1/√x for x in (0,1]. Prove that |P(0)| ≤ 2n+1. The user mentions an idea about if |P(0)| is too large, the polynomial can't change fast enough to avoid intersecting ±1/√x, but they don't see how to formalize it.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. Let's parse the problem.\n\nThe polynomial P(x) has two main conditions: its degree is at most n, and its absolute value is bounded by 1/√x on the interval (0,1]. The goal is to prove that the absolute value at 0 is at most 2n+1.\n\nSo, the assumptions are:\n\n1. P(x) is a polynomial. (This is a given, but maybe it's better to state it as an assumption.)\n2. The degree of P(x) is ≤ n. (This is a key condition.)\n3. For all x in (0,1], |P(x)| ≤ 1/√x. (This is another key condition.)\n\nWait, the original problem states \"degree ≤ n\" and the bound on |P(x)|. The problem is to prove |P(0)| ≤ 2n+1. The example given by the user had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in this case, there's no explicit mention of n's properties beyond being the degree bound. The polynomial's degree is ≤ n, where n is presumably a non-negative integer. But the problem doesn't state that n is an integer, but given it's a degree, n must be a non-negative integer. However, maybe the user expects that to be an assumption. But in the original problem statement, perhaps the user hasn't specified n's type. Wait, in the original problem, the title says \"Prove |P(0)| ≤ 2n+1\", so n is part of the problem statement. The polynomial has degree ≤ n, so n is a non-negative integer. But maybe we need to list that as an assumption? However, in the example given, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", and the formatted assumption included \"n is an integer\". So perhaps here, since the problem says \"degree ≤ n\", we need to assume that n is a non-negative integer. Wait, but in the original problem statement, the user didn't specify any restrictions on n. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nP(x) is a polynomial,\nThe degree of P(x) is ≤ n,\nFor all x ∈ (0,1], |P(x)| ≤ 1/√x.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included the divisibility condition on n. But in this problem, maybe the only assumptions are those stated. So perhaps the problem doesn't have any hidden assumptions beyond the ones explicitly given. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem statement:\n\nLet P(x) be a polynomial with degree ≤ n and |P(x)| ≤ 1/√x for x ∈ (0,1]. Prove that |P(0)| ≤ 2n+1.\n\nSo the assumptions here are:\n\n1. P(x) is a polynomial.\n2. deg(P) ≤ n.\n3. For all x in (0,1], |P(x)| ≤ 1/√x.\n\nThese are the explicit conditions. There's no mention of n being an integer, but since it's the degree bound, n must be a non-negative integer. However, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So perhaps here, we need to infer that n is an integer. Wait, but in the problem statement as given, the user wrote \"Let P(x) be a polynomial with degree ≤ n\", so n is a non-negative integer. But maybe it's better to include that as an assumption. Wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", so the formatted assumption included \"n is an integer\". Here, the original problem says \"degree ≤ n\", so maybe n is an integer, but perhaps the problem expects n to be a positive integer. However, the problem might not specify, but in mathematics, when talking about polynomial degrees, n is usually a non-negative integer. However, the user might not have stated that. So should I include that as an assumption?\n\nBut the original problem as presented in the user's query does not mention n being an integer. So maybe the problem's assumptions are only the three I listed above, and the user is to take n as given. However, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", so in the formatted problem, \"n is an integer\" was an assumption. So perhaps in this problem, the user needs to assume that n is a non-negative integer, but the original problem didn't state that. But maybe the problem is intended for n being a positive integer. Wait, but the problem statement as given by the user does not mention n's nature. So maybe the answer should not include \"n is an integer\" unless it's part of the problem's given. Since the problem says \"degree ≤ n\", and degrees are non-negative integers, perhaps n is a non-negative integer. But maybe the problem allows n to be a real number, but that's not typical. So perhaps the assumption is that n is a non-negative integer. But in the problem as stated, that is not mentioned. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem does not require n to be an integer, but the conclusion |P(0)| ≤ 2n+1 would make sense even if n is a real number, but that's not usual. Wait, but degrees are integers. So the degree of the polynomial is ≤ n, so n must be at least the degree, which is an integer. So perhaps n is an integer. But the problem statement doesn't specify. The user's example included an assumption that n is an integer even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", so maybe here, since the problem doesn't state \"for every integer n\", perhaps it's not necessary. Wait, but the problem says \"degree ≤ n\". Degrees are integers, so n must be at least the degree, which is an integer, so n can be any real number greater than or equal to the degree. But the conclusion is 2n+1, which would typically require n to be an integer. For example, if n were 1.5, then 2n+1=4, but the problem might be intended for integer n. However, the problem as stated doesn't specify. Therefore, perhaps the problem assumes that n is an integer. But since the original problem didn't state that, maybe we shouldn't include it as an assumption. Hmm. This is a bit of a dilemma.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", and the formatted assumption included \"n is an integer\". So in that case, the user added that as an assumption because the original problem specified it. In this current problem, the original problem does not specify that n is an integer, but given that it's about polynomial degrees, perhaps it's implied. However, maybe the problem's intended for n being an integer. But the user hasn't included that in the problem statement. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions are only the three I listed earlier. Let me check again.\n\nThe problem says: Let P(x) be a polynomial with degree ≤n and |P(x)| ≤1/√x for x∈(0,1]. Prove that |P(0)| ≤2n+1.\n\nSo, the explicit assumptions are:\n\n1. P(x) is a polynomial.\n2. The degree of P(x) is ≤n.\n3. For all x in (0,1], |P(x)| ≤1/√x.\n\nThere's no mention of n being an integer. Therefore, in the formatted problem, we should list only these assumptions. However, in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer, so perhaps in this case, since the problem does not state that n is an integer, we should not include it. Wait, but degrees are integers, so if the degree is ≤n, then n must be at least the degree, which is an integer, so n can be any real number ≥ the degree. But the problem's conclusion is 2n+1, which would make sense even if n is a real number. For example, if n=2.5, then 2n+1=6. So the bound would be 6. However, the problem might be intended for integer n. But since the problem statement does not specify, perhaps we shouldn't assume that. Therefore, the only assumptions are the three I mentioned.\n\nWait, but maybe there's an implicit assumption that n is a non-negative integer. Because degrees are non-negative integers. So if the degree is ≤n, then n must be ≥0 and an integer. Wait, but n could be a real number greater than or equal to the degree. For example, if the polynomial has degree 3, then n could be 3.5, and the degree is ≤n. So in that case, n doesn't have to be an integer. But the problem's conclusion is 2n+1, which could still hold even if n is not an integer. However, in mathematical literature, when talking about polynomial degrees, n is typically an integer. So perhaps the problem expects n to be a non-negative integer, but since the problem statement does not specify, perhaps the user did not include that. Therefore, the formatted problem should include the three assumptions as listed.\n\nSo, the assumptions would be:\n\n- P(x) is a polynomial.\n- The degree of P(x) is ≤n.\n- For all x ∈ (0,1], |P(x)| ≤1/√x.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption, each addressing one property of one object (P(x)).\n\nThe problem is to prove |P(0)| ≤2n+1.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nP(x) is a polynomial,\nThe degree of P(x) is ≤n,\nFor all x ∈ (0,1], |P(x)| ≤ 1/√x.\n\nProblem:\nProve that |P(0)| ≤ 2n+1.\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. Here, the problem doesn't state that n is an integer, but if the degree is ≤n, and degrees are integers, then n must be at least as large as the degree, which is an integer, but n itself could be a real number. However, in the conclusion, 2n+1, if n is a real number, then 2n+1 is a real bound. But perhaps the problem is intended for n being an integer, but since the original problem didn't specify, we shouldn't include it as an assumption. Therefore, the assumptions are the three listed above.\n\nI think that's correct. The problem doesn't state any restrictions on n beyond being the upper bound on the degree. Therefore, the formatted problem should list those three assumptions.",
