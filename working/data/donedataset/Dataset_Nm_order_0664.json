    "Content": "When reading a proof of why $x^3+y^3=z^3$ has no nontrivial integer solutions I came across following identity: $$ y^3 = z^3-x^3 = (z-x)(z-\\omega x)(z-\\omega^2 x) \\qquad \\text{where } \\omega = e^{2\\pi i /3} \\quad \\text{i.e.}\\quad  \\omega^3 = 1$$ Expanding the RHS results in: $$ z^3-(1+\\omega+\\omega^2)z^2x+(\\omega+\\omega^2+\\omega^3)zx^2-\\omega^3x^3 = z^3-x^3,$$ since obviously $\\omega+\\omega^2+\\omega^3 = 1+\\omega +\\omega^2 = 0$ . Well then I thought about how obvious that is. I mean geometrically it is obvious that the sum of all $n$ -th unity roots must equal $0$ , but is there an analytical proof? I was not able to come up with one straight away.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question according to the given format. Let me read through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe user is talking about the sum of complex unit roots being zero. They mentioned that in the context of solving the equation x³ + y³ = z³, there's an identity involving ω, a primitive 3rd root of unity. The key point they're bringing up is that the sum 1 + ω + ω² equals zero, and similarly ω + ω² + ω³ is also zero. They want an analytical proof that the sum of all n-th roots of unity is zero.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The problem is about the sum of the n-th roots of unity. The assumptions here would relate to the properties of the roots of unity. Let's break it down:\n\n1. ω is a primitive n-th root of unity. That means ω^n = 1, and no smaller positive integer exponent k < n would satisfy ω^k = 1.\n2. The roots of unity considered are all the n-th roots, which are 1, ω, ω², ..., ω^{n-1}.\n3. The sum in question is the sum of all these roots: 1 + ω + ω² + ... + ω^{n-1}.\n\nWait, but in the example given, the assumption included specific conditions. Here, the problem is general for any n. The user mentions geometrically it's obvious (since they're equally spaced on the unit circle), but wants an analytical proof. So the key assumption is that we're summing all the n-th roots of unity. The problem is to prove that this sum is zero.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, but in this case, the problem is about any integer n ≥ 1. However, in the example, the assumption listed specific properties. Here, the main assumption is that we are considering all the n-th roots of unity. So perhaps the assumptions here are:\n\nAssumption:\n- ω is a primitive n-th root of unity.\n- The sum is taken over all distinct n-th roots of unity.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the user says \"the sum of all n-th unity roots must equal 0\". So the problem is general. The key assumption is that we are considering all the n-th roots of unity. However, in complex analysis, the n-th roots of unity are the solutions to z^n = 1, and there are exactly n distinct roots. The sum of all n-th roots of unity is zero. So the problem is to prove that.\n\nBut perhaps the assumptions need to be more precise. Let me think. For example, the problem might assume that n is a positive integer greater than 1, because if n=1, the sum is just 1. But in the example given, the original problem's assumption included that n is an integer. So here, maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- n is an integer.\n- n ≥ 2.\n- ω is a primitive n-th root of unity.\n- The sum is over all n distinct n-th roots of unity.\n\nBut maybe some of these are redundant. Wait, the problem is to prove that the sum of all n-th roots of unity is zero. The key property here is that they are the roots of the equation z^n = 1. So, using Vieta's formula, the sum of the roots of z^n - 1 = 0 is the coefficient of z^{n-1} with a negative sign. Since the polynomial is z^n - 1, the coefficient of z^{n-1} is 0, so the sum of the roots is 0. But that's a possible approach for the proof. However, the user might not know this and is looking for an analytical proof.\n\nBut in terms of structuring the problem, the assumptions would be the conditions under which the problem holds. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n- n is an integer greater than 1.\n- The roots considered are all the n-th roots of unity (i.e., the solutions to z^n = 1).\n\nBut perhaps the first assumption is that we are considering the sum of all n-th roots of unity, and n is a positive integer. However, when n=1, the sum is 1, which is not zero, so the problem must have n ≥ 2.\n\nWait, but the original problem mentions \"the sum of all n-th unity roots must equal 0\". So maybe the problem implicitly assumes n ≥ 2. Therefore, the assumptions should include that n is an integer greater than 1.\n\nBut in the example provided, the original problem's assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Here, to make the problem statement correct, we need to state that n is an integer greater than 1. Because for n=1, the sum is 1. So the problem as posed by the user is valid for n ≥ 2.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n- n is an integer.\n- n ≥ 2.\n- The sum is over all n-th roots of unity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"n is a positive integer greater than 1\" as one assumption, and \"the roots are all distinct n-th roots of unity\" as another. But in the example, each assumption is a separate line. Let me check the example again:\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted assumptions were:\n\n$n$ is an integer,\n\n$n$ is divisible by 7.\n\nSo each assumption is a separate line. So here, the assumptions for the current problem would be:\n\nn is an integer,\n\nn ≥ 2,\n\nThe sum is over all n-th roots of unity.\n\nWait, but \"the sum is over all n-th roots of unity\" is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Because the problem is to prove that the sum of all n-th roots of unity is zero. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\nn is an integer,\n\nn ≥ 2,\n\nω is a primitive n-th root of unity.\n\nBut no, ω is a specific root in the original problem's example, but in the general case, we don't need to assume a primitive root. The sum is over all roots, not necessarily generated by a primitive root.\n\nWait, the n-th roots of unity are the solutions to z^n = 1. These are 1, ω, ω², ..., ω^{n-1}, where ω = e^{2πi/n}. So in this case, ω is a primitive n-th root of unity. So perhaps the assumption is that ω = e^{2πi/n} (i.e., a primitive root), and the sum is from k=0 to n-1 of ω^k.\n\nBut maybe the problem is more general. However, in the original question, the user refers to the sum of all n-th roots of unity. So the problem is to prove that sum_{k=0}^{n-1} e^{2πik/n} = 0.\n\nThus, the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is a positive integer greater than 1.\n\n- The sum is taken over all n-th roots of unity.\n\nBut perhaps the first assumption is that n is an integer greater than 1. The second is that the roots are the n distinct solutions to z^n = 1.\n\nBut in the example, assumptions are specific to the objects in the problem. Here, the problem's objects are n and the roots. So maybe:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- n is an integer greater than 1.\n\n- The roots are the n distinct solutions to the equation z^n = 1.\n\nBut perhaps that's too detailed. Alternatively, since the problem is about the sum of all n-th roots of unity, the key assumption is that n ≥ 2 (since for n=1, the sum is 1). However, in the original problem, the user says \"the sum of all n-th unity roots must equal 0\", so maybe they are implicitly considering n ≥ 2.\n\nBut to make it precise, the assumptions should include that n is a positive integer greater than 1. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- n is an integer greater than 1.\n\nBecause the problem statement is that the sum is zero, which holds for n ≥ 2. For n=1, it's not zero, so the assumption is necessary.\n\nNow, the problem statement is: Prove that the sum of all n-th roots of unity is zero.\n\nBut in the original question, the user wrote: \"the sum of all n-th unity roots must equal 0\". So the problem is to prove that the sum is zero, given that n is an integer greater than 1.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer greater than 1,\nthe sum is taken over all n-th roots of unity.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the sum of all n-th roots of unity equals zero.\n\nWait, but maybe the second assumption is redundant because the problem statement already says \"sum of all n-th roots of unity\". So perhaps the only necessary assumption is that n is an integer greater than 1.\n\nBut in the example given, the original problem had the assumption that n is divisible by 7, even though the problem statement mentions A(n). So in that case, the assumption included specific conditions on n. Here, similarly, the assumption is that n is an integer greater than 1, because otherwise the sum wouldn't be zero.\n\nHence, the final formatted problem should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nn is an integer greater than 1\nProblem: \nProve that the sum of all n-th roots of unity equals zero.",
