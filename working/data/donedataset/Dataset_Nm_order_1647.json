    "Content": "Given a rational function $R(x)=P(x)/Q(x)$ with real coefficients, is it true that there exists an $M>0$ such that, for every $k\\geq 0$ , the restrictions $R^{(k)}|_{(-\\infty,-M]}$ and $R^{(k)}|_{[M,\\infty)}$ of the $k$ -th derivatives $R^{(k)}(x)$ are all monotonic?\nOr, in other words, is all the interesting stuff happening inside $[-M,M]$ to all orders? If we take the $k$ -th derivative of $P/Q$ , it can be proven by induction that it will be of the form $H/Q^{2^k}$ with $\\deg H\\leq p+(2^k-1)q-k$ where $p=\\deg P$ and $q=\\deg Q$ . Idk if this is of any help. (Edit: notice that we're asking if $\\exists M\\forall k \\ldots$ and not just if $\\forall k \\exists M_k\\ldots$ ; the latter is easy because a polynomial changes sign only finitely many times)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This is false. It is easy to check that the derivatives of $f(x)=\\frac{x-1}{x^2}$ have the form $$f^{(n)}(x)=C_n \\frac{x-n-1}{x^{n+2}}$$ In particular, $f^{(n)}(x)$ changes sign about $x=n+1$ . Thus, $f^{(n-1)}$ fails to be monotone in any open set containing $n+1$ . So there's no absolute constant $M>0$ such that, for all $n$ , $f^{(n)}$ is monotone in $[M, \\infty)$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example they provided shows how assumptions and the problem are separated. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The title is \"Do rational functions eventually have monotonic derivatives?\" The question asks whether for a rational function R(x) = P(x)/Q(x) with real coefficients, there exists an M > 0 such that for every k ≥ 0, the k-th derivatives R^(k)(x) are monotonic when restricted to (-∞, -M] and [M, ∞). \n\nNow, I need to extract the assumptions. The key points here are:\n\n1. R(x) is a rational function, meaning it's the ratio of two polynomials P(x) and Q(x).\n2. The coefficients of P and Q are real.\n3. The question is about the existence of an M such that all derivatives of order k (starting from 0) are monotonic outside the interval [-M, M].\n\nWait, the problem states \"with real coefficients\" which is an assumption about the polynomials P and Q. Also, the problem is about all derivatives of R(x), so each derivative's monotonicity is considered outside some interval. The user in the original question mentions that they're looking for a single M that works for all k, not different M for each k. So the key assumptions are that R is a rational function (P over Q, real coefficients) and that M must work for all k.\n\nIn the example given, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions would be about the properties of R(x). Let me list them:\n\n- R(x) is a rational function defined as P(x)/Q(x), where P and Q are polynomials with real coefficients. (This combines two related points: being a rational function and having real coefficients. But the example splits each assumption into separate lines, so maybe split into two: R(x) is a rational function, P(x) and Q(x) have real coefficients. Wait, but in the example, the first assumption is \"n is an integer\", the second is \"n is divisible by 7\". So each line addresses a single property applied to one object. So here, maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nR(x) is a rational function of the form P(x)/Q(x),\nP(x) has real coefficients,\nQ(x) has real coefficients.\n\nBut wait, the fact that R is a rational function already implies that P and Q are polynomials. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nR(x) is a rational function,\nP(x) and Q(x) are polynomials with real coefficients,\n... Wait, but the problem statement says \"with real coefficients\", so that's part of the definition here. The original problem mentions \"with real coefficients\" as part of the given. So, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nR(x) is a rational function defined as P(x)/Q(x),\nP(x) has real coefficients,\nQ(x) has real coefficients.\n\nBut maybe the first assumption can be that R(x) is a rational function with real coefficients, since that's a standard way to phrase it. However, to follow the example's structure, where each assumption is a separate line, each addressing one property of one object, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nR(x) is a rational function (i.e., R(x) = P(x)/Q(x) where P and Q are polynomials),\nAll coefficients of P(x) are real numbers,\nAll coefficients of Q(x) are real numbers.\n\nThen the problem is to prove the existence of M > 0 such that for all k ≥ 0, the k-th derivative's restrictions to (-∞, -M] and [M, ∞) are monotonic.\n\nWait, the original problem's problem statement is: \"Given a rational function R(x)=P(x)/Q(x) with real coefficients, is it true that there exists an M>0 such that, for every k≥0, the restrictions R^(k)|_{(-∞,-M]} and R^(k)|_{[M,∞)} of the k-th derivatives R^(k)(x) are all monotonic?\"\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n- R(x) is a rational function (P(x)/Q(x))\n- Coefficients of P and Q are real.\n\nThus, structured as:\n\nAssumption:\nR(x) is a rational function defined as P(x)/Q(x),\nP(x) has real coefficients,\nQ(x) has real coefficients.\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists M > 0 such that for every integer k ≥ 0, the restrictions R^{(k)}(x) to (-∞, -M] and [M, ∞) are monotonic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is phrased as a question: \"Is it true that there exists M > 0 such that for every k ≥ 0, the k-th derivatives are monotonic on those intervals?\"\n\nBut the example given by the user rephrased the original problem into a \"Prove that...\" statement. However, in the original problem here, it's posed as a yes/no question. But in the example, the original problem was \"Prove that...\" and the formatted version kept it as \"Prove that...\".\n\nBut in this case, the original problem is a question: \"is it true that...\". However, the user's example converted the problem into a \"Prove that...\" even though the original was a proof request. So perhaps in the formatted problem, we should rephrase the question as a statement to prove. Since the user's example did that. The original problem's example was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\", which was kept as the problem statement. Here, the original problem is a question \"is it true that...\", but we can structure it as \"Prove or disprove that...\", but according to the example, maybe just state the problem as \"Prove that there exists...\".\n\nBut let's check the example again. The original problem was a proof request, so the formatted version was \"Prove that...\". Here, the original problem is a question, but perhaps the formatted problem should be phrased as \"Prove whether there exists...\", but maybe the user expects to follow the structure where the problem is restated as a directive. Alternatively, since the original question is phrased as \"is it true that...\", the problem statement can be \"Determine whether there exists M > 0 such that...\".\n\nBut the example given by the user converted the original problem (which was a proof request) into \"Prove that...\". So perhaps here, even though it's a question, we rephrase it as a directive to prove or disprove. However, the user's instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\", which in the example was a problem statement starting with \"Prove that...\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem part should exactly replicate the question as posed, but in the example, they rephrased it. Let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal problem: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\"\n\nFormatted problem: \nProblem: Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91.\n\nBut the original problem included \"for every integer n\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" in the assumptions. Wait, in the example, the formatted problem's assumptions are \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". However, in the original problem, it's stated as \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they list assumptions as \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem was to prove for every integer n, the number is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions include that n is an integer (since it's \"for every integer n\"), but also adds \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems inconsistent. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That suggests maybe there was a typo or error in the example. Wait, perhaps the original problem was different. Let me check again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem is: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions are: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which would not require n to be divisible by 7. So maybe the example is incorrect? Or perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a condition that n is divisible by 7, but in the example presented here, perhaps there was a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the example is part of a different problem where n is supposed to be divisible by 7. But this is confusing. \n\nWait, perhaps the example is from another problem where the user intended to structure the problem with certain assumptions. For example, maybe the original problem in the example actually had a condition that n is divisible by 7, but the user rephrased it. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in their example. Either way, the important part is that the user wants the assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property of one object.\n\nSo for the current problem, the original question is about a rational function R(x) = P(x)/Q(x) with real coefficients. The assumptions would be:\n\n1. R(x) is a rational function (i.e., R(x) = P(x)/Q(x) where P and Q are polynomials).\n2. P(x) has real coefficients.\n3. Q(x) has real coefficients.\n\nThe problem is to determine whether there exists an M > 0 such that for every k ≥ 0, the k-th derivative of R is monotonic on (-∞, -M] and [M, ∞).\n\nBut how to phrase the problem part? The original question is \"is it true that there exists M...\", so the problem can be phrased as \"Prove whether there exists M > 0 such that for every integer k ≥ 0, the restrictions R^{(k)}(x) to (-∞, -M] and [M, ∞) are monotonic.\" But the example's problem part is a statement to prove. However, since the original question is a yes/no question, maybe we need to adjust it to fit the format. Alternatively, perhaps rephrase it as \"Prove or disprove that there exists...\".\n\nBut the user's example took a statement that was a direct assertion (\"Prove that...\") and kept it as such. So perhaps here, the problem should be phrased as a statement to prove, even if the original is a question. Alternatively, maybe the problem is presented as a question. However, the example's problem part uses \"Prove that...\", so perhaps the user expects the problem to be stated in that way. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to answer the question, so the problem statement would be \"Is it true that there exists M > 0 such that for every k ≥ 0, the k-th derivatives of R(x) are monotonic on (-∞, -M] and [M, ∞)?\" But in the example, the problem was rephrased from the original into a \"Prove that...\" without the \"for every integer n\", which was moved to assumptions. So perhaps here, the problem part is \"Prove that there exists M > 0 such that for every integer k ≥ 0, the k-th derivative of R(x) is monotonic on (-∞, -M] and [M, ∞).\"\n\nBut the original question is asking whether such an M exists, so it's a yes/no question. But the example converted a similar question into a \"Prove that...\" statement. Perhaps in the absence of more examples, follow the structure: list the assumptions and then state the problem as a directive. However, since the user's example has the problem as a statement to prove, even if the original is a question, perhaps we should do the same here.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nR(x) is a rational function defined as P(x)/Q(x),\nP(x) has real coefficients,\nQ(x) has real coefficients.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists M > 0 such that for every integer k ≥ 0, the restrictions of R^{(k)}(x) to (-∞, -M] and [M, ∞) are monotonic.\n\nAlternatively, since the original question is phrased as \"is it true that...\", the problem could be \"Determine whether there exists M > 0 such that...\", but the example uses \"Prove that...\". Given the example, I'll follow that structure.",
