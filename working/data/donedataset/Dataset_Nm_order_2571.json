    "Content": "Feynman path integral is equivalent to Fokker–Planck equation . This is mentioned here , but it's not clear why. This page says Schrodinger equation is also equivalent to Fokker–Planck equation which makes me even more confused. Basically what I am asking is: How to show that Fokker-Plank: $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} p(x, t) = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left[\\mu(x, t) p(x, t)\\right] + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}\\left[D(x, t) p(x, t)\\right]$ is equivalent to path integral: $\\psi(x,t)=\\frac{1}{Z}\\int_{\\mathbf{x}(0)=x} e^{iS(\\mathbf{x},\\dot{\\mathbf{x}})}\\psi_0(\\mathbf{x}(t))\\, \\mathcal{D}\\mathbf{x}$ ? Where $S(\\mathbf{x},\\dot{\\mathbf{x}})= \\int L( \\mathbf{x}(t),\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}(t))dt$ is the action (integral over the Lagrangian) and $\\mathcal{D}\\mathbf{x}$ stands for the integration over all possible paths?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I will start by apologising for a physicist's level of rigor in the following derivations but I think they give good insight into the connection between what I would call stochastic physics' Trinity of Langevin, Fokker-Planck and Path integral. Fokker-Planck from Langevin equation Given a Langevin equation $dZ_t=b(Z_t)dt+\\sigma(Z_t)dW_t$ (the most common form found in physics) we can derive the Fokker-Planck equation from the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation in a quick and dirty way: $$\np(y,t|x)=\\int dz\\, p(y,t|z)p(z,t'|x)\n$$ We suppose that $t = \\delta t$ and thus we can write $$p(y,t|z) = \\left\\langle \\delta (y-z-h)\\right\\rangle_h$$ where $h=\\delta Z$ is defined by the associated Langevin equation. Now we have $$\np(y,t|x)=\\int dz\\, \\left\\langle \\delta (y-z-h)\\right\\rangle_hp(z,t'|x)\\,.\\tag{$\\ast$}\n$$ We can then Taylor expand the delta function as $$\n\\left(1+\\left\\langle h\\right\\rangle \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} +\\frac{1}{2}\\left\\langle h^{2}\\right\\rangle \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} +\\ldots\\right)\\delta(y-z) = (1+\\mathscr{L})\\delta(y-z)\\,,\n$$ then integrating by parts and the delta function we are left with $$\np(y,t|x)=(1+\\mathscr{L^\\dagger})p(y,t'|x)\\,.\n$$ Expanding $p(y,t|x)= p(y,t'|x) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}p(y,t'|x) + \\ldots$ in the limit $t \\rightarrow 0$ we arrive at the Fokker-Planck equation $$\n\\frac{\\partial p(y,t|x)}{\\partial t}=\\mathscr{L^\\dagger}p(y,t|x)\n$$ relabelling $t'$ as $t$. Path integral from Langevin We apply the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation many times: $$\np(y,t|x)=\\int\\prod_{i=1}^{N}dz_{i}\\, p(y,t_{N}|z_{N})\\ldots p(z_{2},t_{2}|z_1)p(z_{1},t_{1}|x)\n$$ And then use $(\\ast)$ to replace each  along with the identity $\\delta(x) = \\int dk \\exp(ikx)$ we get a sequence of averages over complex exponentials: $$\np(y,t|x)=\\int Dz Dk\\, \\left\\langle e^{ik_N(z_N-z_{N-1}-h_N)}\\right\\rangle\\ldots \\left\\langle e^{ik_2(z_2-z_{1}-h_2)}\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle e^{ik_1(z_1-x-h_1)}\\right\\rangle\n$$ however we can still do better. Knowing the probability distribution of $h$ (usually Gaussian in physics) we can write \n$$\n\\left\\langle O \\right\\rangle = \\int dh P(h) O\n$$\nthus after replacing every averaged over exponential we get $$\np(y,t|x)=\\int Dz Dk Dh\\, e^{i\\int dt \\,k\\dot{z}} P[h_t]\n$$ and when you perform the integrations over the paths of $k$ and $h$ you will get your path integral. Path integral from Fokker-Planck I am less sure about how to go about directly showing the equivalence without the presence of a Langevin equation. However if we create a Lagrangian by multiplying the F-P equation by an auxiliary field and then integrate over all paths of our probability density and our auxiliary field, I have a feeling this will work but I am not certain so I will leave my answer here. The main point of this is to show that the path integral and the FP equation are essentially two different representations of the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation. As far as I can tell they are basically interchangeable and I hope someone more knowledgeable than myself can come in and explain why you would use one over the other in certain situations. I hope this has been useful!",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The task is to list all assumptions line by line and then state the problem clearly.\n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The user is asking how to show that the Fokker-Planck equation is equivalent to the Feynman path integral. They provided both equations. The Fokker-Planck equation is a partial differential equation describing the time evolution of a probability distribution, while the path integral is a sum over all possible paths weighted by the action.\n\nNow, the goal is to extract assumptions. Assumptions should be one property or condition per line, applied to one object. Let me parse the problem for such conditions.\n\nThe Fokker-Planck equation given is:\n∂/∂t p(x,t) = -∂/∂x [μ(x,t)p(x,t)] + ∂²/∂x² [D(x,t)p(x,t)]\n\nThe path integral expression is:\nψ(x,t) = (1/Z) ∫_{x(0)=x} e^{iS(x,ẋ)} ψ_0(x(t)) Dx\nwhere S is the action integral of the Lagrangian.\n\nAssumptions here would relate to the conditions under which these two are equivalent. The user mentions equivalence, so perhaps the Fokker-Planck equation is under certain conditions (like specific drift μ and diffusion D coefficients) equivalent to the path integral formulation with a particular Lagrangian. Also, the path integral here uses the action with a Lagrangian, which might imply a specific form of the Lagrangian related to μ and D.\n\nPossible assumptions:\n- The system under consideration is a Markov process (since Fokker-Planck typically applies to Markov processes).\n- The drift coefficient μ(x,t) and diffusion coefficient D(x,t) are smooth functions.\n- The Lagrangian L in the action S corresponds to the dynamics described by the Fokker-Planck equation (maybe a specific form linking L to μ and D).\n- The integration over paths Dx includes all continuous paths with fixed initial condition x(0)=x.\n- The function ψ(x,t) is related to the probability distribution p(x,t) through some transformation (like a Fourier transform or Wick rotation? Since the path integral here uses complex exponent, while Fokker-Planck is real).\n\nBut the problem as stated doesn't specify particular conditions. The user just presents both equations and asks for equivalence. So maybe the assumptions are inherent in the equations given. For example:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The probability distribution p(x,t) satisfies the Fokker-Planck equation with drift μ(x,t) and diffusion D(x,t).\n- The path integral representation ψ(x,t) uses an action S derived from a Lagrangian L( x(t), ẋ(t) ).\n- The integration measure Dx includes all possible paths starting at x(0)=x.\n- The normalization constant Z ensures the integral is well-defined.\n\nWait, but the user's example included specific conditions applied to the object (like n is an integer, n divisible by 7). Here, perhaps the assumptions are about the properties of the functions involved. For example:\n\n- The drift coefficient μ(x,t) is a smooth function of x and t.\n- The diffusion coefficient D(x,t) is a smooth function of x and t.\n- The Lagrangian L is related to μ and D in a specific way (maybe L = (ẋ - μ)^2/(4D) or something like that, typical for path integrals corresponding to Fokker-Planck).\n- The paths x(t) are differentiable with respect to time.\n- The initial condition ψ_0(x(t)) is specified.\n\nHowever, the original question doesn't specify these details. So maybe the assumptions are that these equations are given, and the user wants to show equivalence under general conditions. But perhaps the key is that the Feynman path integral here is actually a Wick-rotated version (Euclidean path integral) since Fokker-Planck is a real equation, whereas the user wrote a path integral with e^{iS}, which is typical for quantum mechanics. But maybe in this context, they are considering imaginary time or a different formulation. So perhaps the assumption is that the path integral is in Euclidean time (Wick rotated), so that the exponent becomes real, which would align with stochastic processes.\n\nBut the user didn't specify that, so maybe the correct approach is to list the assumptions based on what's given. For example:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The function p(x,t) satisfies the Fokker-Planck equation.\n- The path integral representation ψ(x,t) is defined as the integral over all paths starting at x(0)=x.\n- The action S is the integral of the Lagrangian L over time.\n- The Lagrangian L is related to the drift μ and diffusion D coefficients in the Fokker-Planck equation.\n\nBut each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. Let me list them line by line:\n\n1. The function p(x, t) satisfies the Fokker-Planck equation with drift coefficient μ(x, t) and diffusion coefficient D(x, t).\n2. The path integral ψ(x, t) is defined as an integral over all continuous paths starting at x(0) = x.\n3. The action S is the time integral of the Lagrangian L(x(t), ẋ(t)).\n4. The Lagrangian L is related to μ(x, t) and D(x, t) such that the path integral reproduces the Fokker-Planck dynamics.\n5. The measure Dx integrates over all possible paths with the specified initial condition.\n6. The normalization constant Z ensures the path integral converges.\n\nBut maybe some of these are part of the problem statement rather than assumptions. Wait, the original question is asking how to show the equivalence, so the assumptions would be the conditions under which this equivalence holds. For example, the relation between L and μ, D, or specific forms of the Lagrangian.\n\nAlternatively, since the user hasn't provided specific conditions, maybe the assumptions are inherent in the equations as presented. However, the example given in the user's instruction included the assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the original problem but not explicitly stated. So perhaps here, even if the original problem doesn't state them, we need to list the implicit assumptions.\n\nWait, looking back at the example:\n\nOriginal problem states that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted assumption includes \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", but wait, in the original example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the formatted assumption added \"n is divisible by 7\". But in the original problem, there was no mention of n needing to be divisible by 7. Wait, perhaps that was a mistake in the example? Wait, let me check:\n\nOriginal example says:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1 ) -6^n (3^n +2^n ) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", there's no restriction. So maybe the example is wrong, or perhaps there was a miscommunication. However, the user provided that example as their own structure, so perhaps they want us to extract even incorrect assumptions? Or perhaps they want to extract all conditions mentioned, even if the original problem doesn't state them. Hmm, confusing. Alternatively, maybe in the example, the user made a mistake, but we are supposed to follow their format regardless.\n\nIn any case, for the current problem about Fokker-Planck and path integrals, the user wants us to list assumptions line by line. The original question doesn't state explicit conditions, so we have to infer the necessary assumptions for the equivalence to hold.\n\nPossible necessary assumptions:\n\n1. The probability distribution p(x, t) evolves according to the Fokker-Planck equation with drift μ(x, t) and diffusion D(x, t).\n2. The path integral formulation uses a Lagrangian L related to μ and D.\n3. The action S is the time integral of the Lagrangian along a path.\n4. The paths integrated over are all continuous paths starting at x(0) = x.\n5. The normalization constant Z ensures the integral converges.\n6. The function ψ(x, t) is related to p(x, t) through a specific transformation (e.g., Fourier or Wick rotation).\n7. The noise in the stochastic process described by the Fokker-Planck equation is Gaussian.\n\nBut since the original problem doesn't specify these, but the question is about equivalence, the key assumptions would be the conditions under which such an equivalence is valid. For example, the Lagrangian in the path integral must be chosen appropriately to correspond to the drift and diffusion terms. Also, the path integral might require a Wick rotation to imaginary time to align with the real-valued Fokker-Planck equation.\n\nHowever, since the user wrote the path integral with e^{iS}, which is standard in quantum mechanics, but Fokker-Planck is real, perhaps the assumption is that we are considering a Wick-rotated path integral (i.e., t → -it), making the exponent real. This would be a crucial assumption.\n\nSo, compiling the assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\n- The drift coefficient μ(x, t) and diffusion coefficient D(x, t) are smooth functions.\n- The Lagrangian L in the action S is related to μ and D by [specific relation, but since it's not given, maybe just stated as a relation exists].\nWait, but since the problem is to show equivalence, perhaps the key assumption is that the Lagrangian is chosen appropriately. But without more info, we can list:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The system described by the Fokker-Planck equation has drift μ(x, t) and diffusion D(x, t).\n- The action S in the path integral is constructed from a Lagrangian L that depends on μ and D.\n- The path integral is performed over all continuous paths with initial condition x(0) = x.\n- The normalization factor Z ensures the integral is well-defined.\n- The function ψ(x, t) corresponds to the probability distribution p(x, t).\n\nBut I'm not sure if all these are necessary. The example had two assumptions even though the original problem didn't state them. Maybe here, the assumptions are:\n\n- The probability distribution p(x, t) satisfies the Fokker-Planck equation.\n- The path integral representation includes all paths starting at x(0) = x.\n- The action S is given by the integral of the Lagrangian L.\n- The Lagrangian L is related to the drift and diffusion coefficients μ and D.\n\nAlternatively, since the user's example included assumptions that weren't explicitly stated in the original problem (like n divisible by 7), maybe here we need to list assumptions even if they are part of the general context. For instance, in stochastic processes, the equivalence between Fokker-Planck and path integrals often assumes certain conditions like Gaussian noise, Markovian dynamics, etc. But the user might not have mentioned these.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, perhaps it's safer to list the explicit conditions mentioned in the problem statement. The problem statement provides both equations and asks how they're equivalent. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- The Fokker-Planck equation is as given with drift μ(x, t) and diffusion D(x, t).\n- The path integral is defined with the action S and integrates over all paths starting at x(0) = x.\n- The Lagrangian L in the action S corresponds to the dynamics of the Fokker-Planck equation.\n\nBut each assumption should be one line, one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- The function p(x, t) satisfies the Fokker-Planck equation with drift μ(x, t) and diffusion D(x, t).\n- The path integral ψ(x, t) integrates over all paths with initial condition x(0) = x.\n- The action S is the time integral of the Lagrangian L(x(t), ẋ(t)).\n- The Lagrangian L is related to μ(x, t) and D(x, t).\n- The measure Dx includes all continuous paths.\n- The normalization constant Z ensures convergence of the path integral.\n\nBut maybe some of these are redundant. The problem is to show equivalence, so the key assumptions are the forms of the equations and the relationship between L and μ, D. However, since the user hasn't specified, perhaps the answer should list the given elements as assumptions.",
