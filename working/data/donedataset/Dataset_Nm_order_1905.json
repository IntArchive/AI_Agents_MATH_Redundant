    "AcceptedAnswer": "If I remember it right, I saw this inequality long ago, when I was a schoolboy. Then I didn’t solve it. But now it seems the following for me. Of course, the geometric approach is the first solution idea, :-) but it should be developed. Without loss of generality, it suffices to consider Quadrant I of the plane (the disposition in the Quadrant III is symmetric). We try to find the parallel lines separating the curves. The experimental evidence suggests to try \n$2a+3b=x$ and $2d+3c=y$  (see the picture). The first line. In the coordinates $(a/2,b)$ the line is a tangent to the unit circle. It these coordinates the line has the equation  $4(a/2)+3b=x$. Therefore it is tangent to the circle at the point $(4,3)/\\sqrt{4^2+3^2}=(4/5,3/5)$. Then $x=(4\\cdot (4/5)+3\\cdot (3/5))=5$. The second line. $2d+3b\\ge 2\\sqrt{2d\\cdot 3b}=4\\sqrt 6=y$. The squared distance between the lines is $\\frac {(x-y)^2}{2^2+3^2}=1.77\\dots>1.6$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, the goal is to prove that (a - d)^2 + (b - c)^2 ≥ 1.6 given that a² + 4b² = 4 and cd = 4. Hmm, let's start by understanding the constraints and what we need to minimize.\n\nFirst, the equation a² + 4b² = 4. That looks like an ellipse equation. If I rewrite it as (a²)/4 + b² = 1, it's clearer. So, points (a, b) lie on an ellipse with semi-major axis 2 along the a-axis and semi-minor axis 1 along the b-axis. \n\nThen, the other condition is cd = 4. That means c and d are real numbers whose product is 4. So, for any c ≠ 0, d = 4/c. So, (c, d) lies on a hyperbola. \n\nWe need to find the minimum value of the expression (a - d)² + (b - c)². This expression represents the squared distance between the point (d, c) and the point (a, b) in the plane. So, geometrically, the problem is asking for the minimum distance squared between a point on the ellipse (a, b) and a point on the hyperbola (d, c) where cd = 4. The answer needs to show that this minimum squared distance is at least 1.6.\n\nLet me consider using calculus to minimize the expression. Let's set up the function to minimize: f(a, b, c, d) = (a - d)² + (b - c)², subject to the constraints a² + 4b² = 4 and cd = 4. Since cd = 4, we can express d as 4/c, so substituting that into f gives f(a, b, c) = (a - 4/c)^2 + (b - c)^2. Now, we have two variables a, b, c with the constraint a² + 4b² = 4. Maybe we can use Lagrange multipliers here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe parameterize the ellipse. Let me parametrize the ellipse using trigonometric functions. Since a²/4 + b² =1, let me set a = 2 cos θ and b = sin θ. Then, substituting into the expression, we get:\n\n(a - d)^2 + (b - c)^2 = (2 cos θ - d)^2 + (sin θ - c)^2.\n\nBut we still have the constraint cd =4. So, d =4/c. Therefore, substituting d =4/c, the expression becomes:\n\n(2 cos θ - 4/c)^2 + (sin θ - c)^2.\n\nNow, we have to minimize this expression over real numbers c ≠0 and θ in [0, 2π). That seems complicated. Maybe take derivatives with respect to c and θ?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps fix c and then find the minimum over θ, then minimize over c. Let me try that approach.\n\nFor a fixed c, the expression becomes:\n\n(2 cos θ - 4/c)^2 + (sin θ - c)^2.\n\nLet me expand this:\n\n= 4 cos² θ - (16/c) cos θ + 16/c² + sin² θ - 2c sin θ + c².\n\nCombine terms:\n\n= (4 cos² θ + sin² θ) - (16/c) cos θ - 2c sin θ + (16/c² + c²).\n\nNote that 4 cos² θ + sin² θ = 3 cos² θ + 1. Because 4 cos² + sin² = 3 cos² + (cos² + sin²) = 3 cos² +1. So:\n\n= 3 cos² θ +1 - (16/c) cos θ - 2c sin θ + (16/c² + c²).\n\nNow, this is a function of θ. To find the minimum over θ for fixed c, perhaps we can take the derivative with respect to θ and set it to zero.\n\nLet me denote the expression as E(θ) = 3 cos² θ +1 - (16/c) cos θ - 2c sin θ + (16/c² + c²).\n\nCompute dE/dθ:\n\ndE/dθ = -6 cos θ sin θ + (16/c) sin θ - 2c cos θ.\n\nSet derivative to zero:\n\n-6 cos θ sin θ + (16/c) sin θ - 2c cos θ = 0.\n\nFactor terms:\n\nsin θ (-6 cos θ + 16/c) + cos θ (-2c) =0.\n\nHmm, this equation looks messy. Maybe we can factor this differently or use substitution. Let me see:\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\nsin θ (16/c - 6 cos θ) = 2c cos θ.\n\nDivide both sides by cos θ (assuming cos θ ≠0):\n\ntan θ (16/c - 6 cos θ) = 2c.\n\nBut this might not help much. Alternatively, let me consider expressing this as:\n\nLet me denote A = -6 cos θ sin θ, B = (16/c) sin θ, C = -2c cos θ.\n\nSo, A + B + C =0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe write the equation as:\n\nsin θ (16/c - 6 cos θ) = 2c cos θ.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's a smarter approach. Let's consider using the method of Lagrange multipliers on the original problem. Let me try that.\n\nWe need to minimize f(a,b,c,d) = (a - d)^2 + (b - c)^2 subject to the constraints:\n\n1. a² +4b² =4,\n\n2. cd =4.\n\nWe can set up the Lagrangian:\n\nL = (a - d)^2 + (b - c)^2 + λ(a² +4b² -4) + μ(cd -4).\n\nTake partial derivatives with respect to all variables and set them to zero.\n\nPartial derivative with respect to a:\n\n2(a - d) + 2λ a =0 → (a - d) + λ a =0. (1)\n\nPartial derivative with respect to b:\n\n2(b - c) + 8λ b =0 → (b - c) +4λ b=0. (2)\n\nPartial derivative with respect to c:\n\n-2(b - c) + μ d =0. (3)\n\nPartial derivative with respect to d:\n\n-2(a - d) + μ c =0. (4)\n\nPartial derivatives with respect to λ and μ give back the constraints.\n\nSo, we have four equations (1)-(4) plus the constraints.\n\nFrom equation (1): (a - d) = -λ a.\n\nFrom equation (4): -2(a - d) + μ c =0. Substitute (a - d) from (1):\n\n-2(-λ a) + μ c =0 → 2λ a + μ c =0. (4a)\n\nSimilarly, from equation (2): (b - c) = -4λ b.\n\nFrom equation (3): -2(b - c) + μ d =0. Substitute (b - c) from (2):\n\n-2(-4λ b) + μ d =0 → 8λ b + μ d =0. (3a)\n\nSo now equations (3a) and (4a) are:\n\n8λ b + μ d =0,\n\n2λ a + μ c =0.\n\nWe can solve these for μ. From (4a): μ = -2λ a / c.\n\nSubstitute into (3a):\n\n8λ b + (-2λ a / c) d =0.\n\nBut from the constraint cd=4, we have d=4/c. Substitute that:\n\n8λ b + (-2λ a / c)(4/c) =0 → 8λ b -8λ a / c² =0.\n\nFactor out 8λ:\n\n8λ (b - a / c²) =0.\n\nAssuming λ ≠0 (if λ=0, then from equations (1) and (2), a=d and b=c, but then check constraints. If a=d and b=c, then from cd=4, c*d=4 → c*a=4. But a² +4b²=4, so a² +4c²=4. So if c*a=4, then a=4/c, substitute into a² +4c²=4 → (16/c²) +4c²=4. Multiply by c²: 16 +4c^4=4c² →4c^4 -4c² +16=0 → c^4 -c² +4=0. The discriminant is 1 -16 = -15 <0. No real solutions. So λ=0 is impossible. Thus, λ≠0.\n\nTherefore, from 8λ (b - a/c²)=0, since λ≠0, then:\n\nb - a/c² =0 → b = a / c². (5)\n\nAlso, from (4a): μ = -2λ a / c.\n\nFrom equation (3a): 8λ b + μ d =0. Substitute μ and d=4/c:\n\n8λ b + (-2λ a / c)(4/c) =0 →8λ b -8λ a / c² =0.\n\nBut from (5), b =a/c², so substitute b:\n\n8λ (a/c²) -8λ a /c² =0 →0=0. So this is consistent.\n\nNow, we have equation (5): b = a /c².\n\nNow, from the constraint a² +4b²=4, substitute b:\n\na² +4(a² /c^4)=4 →a² (1 +4/c^4)=4 →a²=4 / (1 +4/c^4)=4c^4/(c^4 +4).\n\nSimilarly, from the other constraint cd=4, d=4/c.\n\nAlso, from equation (1): (a - d) = -λ a.\n\nFrom equation (2): (b - c) = -4λ b.\n\nBut since b =a/c², substitute into equation (2):\n\n(a/c² -c) = -4λ (a/c²).\n\nMultiply both sides by c²:\n\na -c^3 = -4λ a.\n\nRearranged: a -c^3 +4λ a =0 →a(1 +4λ) -c^3=0. (6)\n\nFrom equation (1): a -d = -λ a → a - (4/c) = -λ a →a + λ a =4/c →a(1 +λ)=4/c. (7)\n\nNow, we have equations (5), (6), (7), and the expressions for a² and b.\n\nLet me try to express everything in terms of c. From equation (7): a= (4/c)/(1 +λ). From equation (6): a(1 +4λ)=c^3.\n\nSubstitute a from (7) into (6):\n\n(4/(c(1 +λ)))(1 +4λ) =c^3 → (4(1 +4λ))/(c(1 +λ))=c^3 →4(1 +4λ)=c^4(1 +λ).\n\nSo, 4(1 +4λ) =c^4(1 +λ). Let's call this equation (8).\n\nAlso, from equation (5): b =a/c²= (4/(c(1 +λ)))/c²=4/(c^3(1 +λ)).\n\nBut from the expression for a²: a²=4c^4/(c^4 +4). From equation (7), a=4/(c(1 +λ)) → a²=16/(c²(1 +λ)^2). So:\n\n16/(c²(1 +λ)^2)=4c^4/(c^4 +4) →4/(c²(1 +λ)^2)=c^4/(c^4 +4).\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n4(c^4 +4) =c^6(1 +λ)^2.\n\nBut from equation (8): 4(1 +4λ)=c^4(1 +λ). Let's solve equation (8) for (1 +λ):\n\n1 +λ=4(1 +4λ)/c^4.\n\nSubstitute into the previous equation:\n\n4(c^4 +4)=c^6*(16(1 +4λ)^2)/(c^8) →4(c^4 +4)=16(1 +4λ)^2/c².\n\nBut this seems getting too complicated. Maybe instead, let's let’s denote t = c². Then, maybe we can express equations in terms of t.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that this system might have symmetric solutions. Maybe assume that c and d are related to a and b in some way. For instance, if we consider points (a,b) on the ellipse and (d,c) on the hyperbola, perhaps the minimal distance occurs at points where certain ratios hold.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or some other inequality. Let me think.\n\nThe problem requires that (a - d)^2 + (b - c)^2 ≥1.6. To prove this, maybe use the method of Lagrange multipliers but the equations are getting too involved. Maybe another approach.\n\nLet me consider parametrizing c. Since cd=4, d=4/c. So, the point (d,c) is (4/c, c). So, we can think of c as a parameter, and for each c, the minimal distance from (4/c, c) to the ellipse a² +4b²=4. Then, we need to find the minimal distance over all c.\n\nThe minimal distance squared from a point (d,c) to the ellipse is given by the expression we need to minimize. Maybe parametrize the ellipse and then minimize over c and the ellipse parameters.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the minimal distance from a point to an ellipse can be found using calculus or geometric methods, but it's non-trivial.\n\nAlternatively, use the parametrization of the ellipse as a=2cosθ, b=sinθ, then express the distance squared to (4/c, c), and then consider optimizing over θ and c.\n\nWait, earlier I tried substituting a=2cosθ and b=sinθ, leading to the expression in terms of θ and c. Then, perhaps for each c, find the minimal over θ, then minimize over c.\n\nAlternatively, fix θ and find the optimal c for that θ, then minimize over θ.\n\nLet me try this approach. Suppose we fix θ, then we need to minimize (2cosθ -4/c)^2 + (sinθ -c)^2 with respect to c.\n\nLet me denote this as f(c) = (2cosθ -4/c)^2 + (sinθ -c)^2. To find the minimum over c, take derivative with respect to c:\n\nf’(c) = 2(2cosθ -4/c)(4/c²) + 2(sinθ -c)(-1).\n\nSet f’(c)=0:\n\n2*(2cosθ -4/c)*(4/c²) - 2(sinθ -c) =0.\n\nDivide by 2:\n\n(2cosθ -4/c)*(4/c²) - (sinθ -c) =0.\n\nMultiply out:\n\n(8cosθ/c² -16/c³) - sinθ +c =0.\n\nThis is a nonlinear equation in c, which might be difficult to solve analytically. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider substituting c =2/x, since cd=4 implies d=4/c=2x if c=2/x. Maybe this substitution simplifies things? Let's see.\n\nLet c=2/x, then d=4/c=2x. So, the point (d,c)=(2x, 2/x). Then, the expression becomes:\n\n(a -2x)^2 + (b -2/x)^2.\n\nBut a² +4b²=4. Maybe this substitution helps? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the problem might have symmetry when c=2 or c=1 or some specific value. Let me test some specific values.\n\nFor example, take c=2. Then d=4/2=2. Then, the point (d,c)=(2,2). The distance squared to the ellipse a² +4b²=4.\n\nTo find the minimal distance from (2,2) to the ellipse. Let me compute this.\n\nThe distance squared is (a-2)^2 + (b-2)^2. Subject to a² +4b²=4.\n\nUse Lagrange multipliers here. Let’s set up:\n\nL = (a-2)^2 + (b-2)^2 + λ(a² +4b² -4).\n\nDerivatives:\n\ndL/da = 2(a-2) + 2λ a =0 → (a-2) + λ a =0 → a(1 +λ) =2.\n\ndL/db = 2(b-2) +8λ b =0 → (b-2) +4λ b=0 → b(1 +4λ)=2.\n\nSolve for a and b:\n\nFrom a(1 +λ)=2 → a=2/(1 +λ).\n\nFrom b(1 +4λ)=2 → b=2/(1 +4λ).\n\nSubstitute into the constraint:\n\na² +4b²=4 → [4/(1 +λ)^2] +4*[4/(1 +4λ)^2] =4.\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n1/(1 +λ)^2 +4/(1 +4λ)^2 =1.\n\nLet’s let μ=λ. So,\n\n1/(1 +μ)^2 +4/(1 +4μ)^2=1.\n\nThis equation might be solvable numerically. Let me attempt to find μ.\n\nLet’s try μ=0: 1 +4=5≠1.\n\nμ=1: 1/4 +4/25=0.25 +0.16=0.41≠1.\n\nμ=-0.5: 1/(0.5)^2 +4/( -1)^2=4 +4=8≠1.\n\nμ= -0.25: 1/(0.75)^2 +4/(0)^2 → undefined.\n\nHmm, maybe try μ=0.2:\n\n1/(1.2)^2 +4/(1.8)^2≈0.694 +4/3.24≈0.694 +1.235≈1.929>1.\n\nToo big. μ=0.5:\n\n1/(1.5)^2 +4/(3)^2≈0.444 +0.444≈0.888<1.\n\nSo between μ=0.5 and μ=0.2, the sum crosses 1.\n\nLet me use the Newton-Raphson method. Let f(μ)=1/(1+μ)^2 +4/(1+4μ)^2 -1.\n\nWe need to find μ where f(μ)=0.\n\nCompute f(0.5)=0.444+0.444-1≈-0.112.\n\nf(0.4): 1/(1.4)^2≈0.510, 4/(2.6)^2≈4/6.76≈0.592, total≈1.102-1≈0.102.\n\nWait, f(0.4)=0.510+0.592=1.102-1=0.102>0.\n\nf(0.45): 1/(1.45)^2≈1/2.1025≈0.475, 4/(1+1.8)^2=4/(2.8)^2≈4/7.84≈0.510. Total≈0.475+0.510=0.985-1≈-0.015.\n\nSo f(0.45)≈-0.015.\n\nBetween μ=0.4 (f=0.102) and μ=0.45 (f=-0.015). Let's approximate.\n\nAssume f(μ) is linear between these points. The change in μ is 0.05, change in f is -0.117. To reach f=0 from μ=0.4, need delta μ=0.05*(0.102)/0.117≈0.05*0.871≈0.0436. So μ≈0.4+0.0436≈0.4436.\n\nCompute f(0.4436):\n\n1/(1.4436)^2≈1/2.084≈0.480,\n\n4/(1+4*0.4436)^2=4/(1+1.7744)^2=4/(2.7744)^2≈4/7.698≈0.519.\n\nTotal≈0.480+0.519=0.999≈1. So f(0.4436)≈-0.001. Close enough.\n\nThus, μ≈0.4436.\n\nThen, a=2/(1+0.4436)=2/1.4436≈1.385,\n\nb=2/(1+4*0.4436)=2/(1+1.7744)=2/2.7744≈0.721.\n\nCheck a² +4b²≈(1.385)^2 +4*(0.721)^2≈1.918 +4*0.519≈1.918+2.078≈4.0, which satisfies.\n\nThen, the distance squared is (a-2)^2 + (b-2)^2≈(1.385-2)^2 + (0.721-2)^2≈(-0.615)^2 + (-1.279)^2≈0.378 +1.636≈2.014. So the distance squared is about 2.014 when c=2, which is greater than 1.6. So this is not the minimum.\n\nHmm, maybe try c=1. Then d=4/1=4. The point (4,1). Compute the minimal distance squared from (4,1) to the ellipse.\n\nSet up Lagrangian again. L=(a-4)^2 + (b-1)^2 +λ(a² +4b² -4).\n\nDerivatives:\n\ndL/da=2(a-4)+2λ a=0 →a-4 +λ a=0→a(1+λ)=4.\n\ndL/db=2(b-1)+8λ b=0→b-1 +4λ b=0→b(1+4λ)=1.\n\nSo, a=4/(1+λ), b=1/(1+4λ).\n\nSubstitute into a² +4b²=4:\n\n[16/(1+λ)^2] +4[1/(1+4λ)^2] =4.\n\nDivide by 4:\n\n4/(1+λ)^2 +1/(1+4λ)^2 =1.\n\nLet’s call this equation. Let me try to find λ numerically.\n\nLet’s try λ=0: 4 +1=5≠1.\n\nλ=1: 4/4 +1/25=1 +0.04=1.04≈1. Close.\n\nλ=0.95: denominator1=1.95, denominator2=1+3.8=4.8.\n\n4/(1.95)^2≈4/3.8025≈1.052,\n\n1/(4.8)^2≈0.043,\n\nTotal≈1.052+0.043≈1.095>1.\n\nλ=1.05:\n\n4/(2.05)^2≈4/4.2025≈0.952,\n\n1/(1+4.2)^2=1/(5.2)^2≈0.034,\n\nTotal≈0.952+0.034≈0.986<1.\n\nSo between λ=0.95 and 1.05, the sum crosses 1.\n\nAt λ=1: sum=1.04.\n\nAt λ=1.02:\n\n4/(2.02)^2≈4/4.0804≈0.980,\n\n1/(1+4.08)=1/5.08≈0.196. Wait, no, denominator is (1+4*1.02)=1+4.08=5.08. So 1/(5.08)^2≈0.0388.\n\nTotal≈0.980+0.0388≈1.0188>1.\n\nλ=1.03:\n\n4/(2.03)^2≈4/4.1209≈0.970,\n\n1/(5.12)^2≈0.037,\n\nTotal≈0.970+0.037≈1.007.\n\nλ=1.04:\n\n4/(2.04)^2≈4/4.1616≈0.961,\n\n1/(5.16)^2≈0.035,\n\nTotal≈0.961+0.035≈0.996.\n\nSo between λ=1.03 and 1.04.\n\nUsing linear approximation:\n\nAt λ=1.03, sum≈1.007.\n\nAt λ=1.04, sum≈0.996.\n\nWe need to find λ where sum=1.\n\nChange in λ=0.01, change in sum≈-0.011.\n\nNeed to decrease sum by 0.007 from 1.007.\n\nDelta λ≈0.01*(0.007)/0.011≈0.00636.\n\nThus, λ≈1.03 -0.00636≈1.0236.\n\nCompute at λ=1.0236:\n\nDenominator1=1+1.0236=2.0236,\n\n4/(2.0236)^2≈4/4.095≈0.976,\n\nDenominator2=1+4*1.0236=1+4.0944≈5.0944,\n\n1/(5.0944)^2≈1/25.953≈0.0385,\n\nSum≈0.976+0.0385≈1.0145. Hmm, not precise. Maybe need better approximation.\n\nAlternatively, accept that the minimal distance squared is around 1, which is less than 1.6. But wait, when c=1, the minimal distance squared is about 1, but the problem states that it should be at least 1.6. That contradicts, so there must be a mistake.\n\nWait, but when c=1, we're finding the minimal distance squared from (4,1) to the ellipse. Wait, (4,1) is far from the ellipse. The ellipse has a maximum a=2, so a=4 is outside the ellipse. So the minimal distance from (4,1) to the ellipse would be greater than the distance from (4,1) to (2,0), which is sqrt((4-2)^2 + (1-0)^2)=sqrt(4 +1)=sqrt(5)≈2.236, so distance squared≈5, which is way more than 1.6. But when I computed with λ≈1.0236, got sum≈1.0145, but that must be incorrect. Wait, maybe my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, no. When you use Lagrange multipliers, you find the minimal distance squared. But if the minimal distance squared computed is about 1 when c=1, but geometrically, the distance should be larger. Therefore, perhaps my calculation is incorrect.\n\nWait, when I set c=1, then the point is (d,c)=(4,1). The ellipse is a² +4b²=4. The closest point on the ellipse to (4,1) would be near a=2, b=0. Let's compute the distance squared from (2,0) to (4,1): (2-4)^2 + (0-1)^2=4 +1=5, so distance squared is 5. If the minimal is found to be around 1, that's impossible. So my earlier calculation must be wrong.\n\nAh, I see the mistake. When I set up the Lagrangian for minimizing (a-4)^2 + (b-1)^2 subject to a² +4b²=4, the equations lead to a solution inside the ellipse? But the ellipse is a closed curve, and the minimal distance should be attained at some point on the ellipse. But my computation resulted in a=4/(1+λ)≈4/(1+1.0236)≈4/2.0236≈1.976, which is close to 2, and b=1/(1+4*1.0236)=1/(5.0944)≈0.196. So the point (a,b)≈(1.976, 0.196). Then distance squared is (1.976-4)^2 + (0.196-1)^2≈( -2.024)^2 + (-0.804)^2≈4.097 +0.646≈4.743, which is approximately 4.74, distance squared. But earlier calculation with λ≈1.0236 gave sum≈1.0145? That doesn't make sense. Wait, no, the sum 1/(1+λ)^2 +4/(1+4λ)^2=1 came from the constraint equation after substitution. That doesn't directly give the distance squared. Let's compute the distance squared correctly.\n\nIf a≈1.976, b≈0.196, then:\n\n(a-4)^2 + (b-1)^2≈(1.976-4)^2 + (0.196-1)^2≈(-2.024)^2 + (-0.804)^2≈4.097 +0.646≈4.743. So distance squared≈4.743, which is about 4.74, which is greater than 1.6. So even this is not the minimum.\n\nThis suggests that maybe the minimal value occurs somewhere else. Let's try c=√2. Then d=4/√2=2√2≈2.828. The point (d,c)=(2√2,√2≈1.414). Compute the minimal distance squared from this point to the ellipse.\n\nAgain, use Lagrange multipliers:\n\nL=(a -2√2)^2 + (b -√2)^2 +λ(a² +4b² -4).\n\nDerivatives:\n\ndL/da=2(a -2√2) +2λ a=0 → (a -2√2) +λ a=0 →a(1+λ)=2√2.\n\ndL/db=2(b -√2) +8λ b=0 → (b -√2) +4λ b=0 →b(1+4λ)=√2.\n\nThus, a=2√2/(1+λ), b=√2/(1+4λ).\n\nSubstitute into a² +4b²=4:\n\n(8/(1+λ)^2) +4*(2/(1+4λ)^2)=4 →8/(1+λ)^2 +8/(1+4λ)^2=4 →2/(1+λ)^2 +2/(1+4λ)^2=1.\n\nLet’s attempt to solve this equation numerically.\n\nLet’s assume λ=0.5:\n\n2/(1.5)^2 +2/(3)^2=2/2.25 +2/9≈0.888 +0.222≈1.11>1.\n\nλ=0.6:\n\n2/(1.6)^2 +2/(1+2.4)^2=2/2.56 +2/13.76≈0.781 +0.145≈0.926<1.\n\nBetween λ=0.5 and 0.6.\n\nAt λ=0.55:\n\n2/(1.55)^2 +2/(1+2.2)^2≈2/2.4025 +2/10.24≈0.832 +0.195≈1.027>1.\n\nAt λ=0.575:\n\n2/(1.575)^2≈2/2.480≈0.806,\n\n2/(1+4*0.575)=2/(1+2.3)=2/3.3≈0.606, squared≈0.367, so 2/0.367≈5.45? Wait, no:\n\nWait, denominator is (1+4λ)=1+4*0.575=1+2.3=3.3. So 1/(3.3)^2≈1/10.89≈0.0918. Multiply by 2:≈0.183.\n\nSo total≈0.806 +0.183≈0.989<1.\n\nSo between λ=0.55 (sum≈1.027) and λ=0.575 (sum≈0.989).\n\nLet’s use linear approximation.\n\nDifference in sum from λ=0.55 to 0.575 (delta λ=0.025) is 0.989-1.027=-0.038.\n\nNeed to find delta λ to go from sum=1.027 to sum=1: delta sum=-0.027.\n\ndelta λ=0.025*(-0.027)/(-0.038)≈0.025*0.71≈0.0178.\n\nSo λ≈0.55+0.0178≈0.5678.\n\nCompute sum at λ≈0.5678:\n\n1+λ≈1.5678,\n\n1+4λ≈1+4*0.5678≈1+2.271≈3.271,\n\n2/(1.5678^2)+2/(3.271^2)≈2/2.458 +2/10.70≈0.813 +0.187≈1.0.\n\nThus, λ≈0.5678.\n\nThen, a=2√2/(1+0.5678)=2√2/1.5678≈2*1.414/1.5678≈2.828/1.5678≈1.805,\n\nb=√2/(1+4*0.5678)=√2/(1+2.271)=√2/3.271≈1.414/3.271≈0.433.\n\nCheck a² +4b²≈(1.805)^2 +4*(0.433)^2≈3.258 +4*0.187≈3.258+0.748≈4.006, which is close.\n\nThen, the distance squared is (a -2√2)^2 + (b -√2)^2≈(1.805-2.828)^2 + (0.433-1.414)^2≈(-1.023)^2 + (-0.981)^2≈1.047 +0.962≈2.009. Still above 1.6.\n\nThis suggests that the minimal distance squared might be around 1.6, but where?\n\nPerhaps we need to find the optimal c that minimizes the minimal distance. Let's consider that the minimal occurs when the gradients are colinear or something. Alternatively, perhaps use the parametrization and set derivative to zero.\n\nAlternatively, think of this as optimizing two variables. Let me try to use Cauchy-Schwarz.\n\nWe need to bound (a -d)^2 + (b -c)^2.\n\nGiven that a² +4b²=4 and cd=4.\n\nLet me consider expanding the expression:\n\n(a -d)^2 + (b -c)^2 =a² -2ad +d² +b² -2bc +c².\n\nBut we know a² +4b²=4. So, replace a² with 4 -4b²:\n\n= (4 -4b²) -2ad +d² +b² -2bc +c²\n\n=4 -3b² -2ad +d² -2bc +c².\n\nBut this doesn't seem helpful. Maybe express in terms of variables.\n\nAlternatively, use substitution. From cd=4, d=4/c. So:\n\nExpression becomes:\n\n(a -4/c)^2 + (b -c)^2.\n\nWe need to minimize this over a and b such that a² +4b²=4.\n\nThis is equivalent to finding the minimal distance squared from the point (4/c, c) to the ellipse a² +4b²=4.\n\nThe minimal distance from a point to an ellipse can be found using the formula involving solving a quartic equation, but it's complicated. Alternatively, use parametrization.\n\nLet me use the parametrization a=2cosθ, b=sinθ. Then the distance squared is:\n\n(2cosθ -4/c)^2 + (sinθ -c)^2.\n\nTo find the minimal distance over θ and c. Let me consider this as a function of θ and c. To find its minimum.\n\nPerhaps fix θ and find the optimal c, then find the minimal over θ.\n\nFor fixed θ, the expression is:\n\n(2cosθ -4/c)^2 + (sinθ -c)^2.\n\nLet’s denote this as f(c). Take derivative with respect to c:\n\nf’(c) = 2(2cosθ -4/c)(4/c²) + 2(sinθ -c)(-1).\n\nSet to zero:\n\n(2cosθ -4/c)(4/c²) - (sinθ -c) =0.\n\nMultiply out:\n\n8cosθ/c² -16/c³ -sinθ +c =0.\n\nMultiply both sides by c³ to eliminate denominators:\n\n8cosθ c -16 -sinθ c³ +c^4 =0.\n\nRearranged:\n\nc^4 -sinθ c³ +8cosθ c -16=0.\n\nThis is a quartic equation in c, which is difficult to solve analytically. However, perhaps for specific θ, we can find solutions.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that the minimal occurs when the point (4/c, c) lies on some specific curve related to the ellipse. Alternatively, use the method of auxiliary variables.\n\nAlternatively, use the AM-GM inequality. Let me think.\n\nWe need to find the minimum of (a -d)^2 + (b -c)^2 given a² +4b²=4 and cd=4.\n\nLet me consider using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. For vectors (a, 2b) and (1, 2), but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider that (a -d)^2 + (b -c)^2 ≥ [(a -d) + (b -c)]^2 /2 by Cauchy-Schwarz, but not sure if helpful.\n\nAlternatively, expand the expression:\n\n(a -d)^2 + (b -c)^2 =a² +d² -2ad +b² +c² -2bc.\n\nGiven a² +4b²=4, so a²=4 -4b². Substitute:\n\n=4 -4b² +d² -2ad +b² +c² -2bc.\n\n=4 -3b² +d² +c² -2ad -2bc.\n\nBut since cd=4, d=4/c. Substitute d=4/c:\n\n=4 -3b² + (16/c²) +c² -2a*(4/c) -2bc.\n\n=4 -3b² +16/c² +c² -8a/c -2bc.\n\nStill complicated. Maybe express a in terms of b from the ellipse equation. a=±2√(1 -b²). But this introduces square roots.\n\nAlternatively, use substitution variables. Let me let x=a, y=2b. Then the ellipse equation becomes x² + y²=4. Then, the expression becomes:\n\n(x -d)^2 + ( (y/2) -c )^2.\n\nBut cd=4. So, need to minimize (x -4/c)^2 + (y/2 -c)^2 over x² + y²=4 and cd=4.\n\nWait, this might be helpful. Let me rewrite:\n\nThe expression is (x -4/c)^2 + (y/2 -c)^2, with x² + y²=4.\n\nThis is the distance squared from the point (4/c, 2c) to the point (x, y) on the circle x² + y²=4.\n\nSo, the minimal distance squared between the point (4/c, 2c) and the circle of radius 2 centered at the origin. The minimal distance squared would be (distance between origin and (4/c, 2c) minus radius)^2.\n\nThe distance from origin to (4/c, 2c) is sqrt( (4/c)^2 + (2c)^2 ).\n\nCompute that:\n\nsqrt(16/c² +4c²)=sqrt(4c² +16/c²).\n\nThe minimal distance from the point to the circle is |sqrt(4c² +16/c²) -2|. Therefore, the minimal distance squared is (sqrt(4c² +16/c²) -2)^2.\n\nTherefore, the minimal value of (a -d)^2 + (b -c)^2 is (sqrt(4c² +16/c²) -2)^2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me verify.\n\nYes, because the minimal distance from a point (P, Q) to the circle x² + y²=4 is |sqrt(P² + Q²) -2|. So, if the expression is (x - P)^2 + (y - Q)^2, its minimum over x² + y²=4 is (sqrt(P² + Q²) -2)^2.\n\nIn our case, P=4/c and Q=2c. So, sqrt(P² + Q²)=sqrt( (16/c²) +4c² ).\n\nTherefore, minimal distance squared is (sqrt(4c² +16/c²) -2)^2.\n\nTherefore, we need to minimize this expression over c≠0, and then show that the minimum is at least 1.6.\n\nSo, define f(c)= (sqrt(4c² +16/c²) -2)^2.\n\nWe need to find the minimum of f(c) over c≠0.\n\nLet’s set t =c², t>0. Then, f(c)= (sqrt(4t +16/t) -2)^2.\n\nLet’s denote g(t)=sqrt(4t +16/t) -2. Then, f(c)=g(t)^2.\n\nWe need to minimize g(t)^2 over t>0.\n\nCompute derivative of g(t):\n\ng(t)=sqrt(4t +16/t) -2,\n\ng’(t)= (4 -16/t²)/(2 sqrt(4t +16/t)).\n\nSet derivative to zero:\n\n4 -16/t²=0 →4=16/t² →t²=4→t=2 (since t>0).\n\nThus, the critical point is at t=2. Check second derivative or endpoints.\n\nAt t=2, compute g(2):\n\nsqrt(4*2 +16/2) -2= sqrt(8 +8)-2= sqrt(16)-2=4-2=2.\n\nTherefore, g(2)=2, so f(c)=g(t)^2=4.\n\nWait, but that's not possible. Earlier examples gave higher values. What's wrong here?\n\nWait, no, when t=2, c²=2, so c=√2 or -√2. Then, the point (4/c, 2c)=(4/√2, 2√2)=(2√2, 2√2). The distance from this point to the origin is sqrt( (2√2)^2 + (2√2)^2 )=sqrt(8 +8)=sqrt(16)=4. Therefore, the minimal distance to the circle of radius 2 is 4-2=2, so distance squared is 4. But earlier example with c=√2 gave distance squared≈2.009, which contradicts. What's the mistake?\n\nWait, I think there's confusion between variables. Originally, we made substitution x=a, y=2b, so the ellipse a² +4b²=4 becomes x² + y²=4. Then, the expression (a -d)^2 + (b -c)^2 is equivalent to (x -d)^2 + (y/2 -c)^2. Wait, but the point (d, c) in the original problem corresponds to the point (d, 2c) in terms of y. So, the distance squared from (x,y) to (d, 2c) would be (x -d)^2 + (y -2c)^2. But in our case, we have (x -d)^2 + (y/2 -c)^2. So, not sure if the previous approach applies.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the substitution.\n\nOriginal variables: a, b, c, d.\n\nConstraints: a² +4b²=4, cd=4.\n\nExpression to minimize: (a -d)^2 + (b -c)^2.\n\nLet x=a, y=2b. Then, x² + y²=4. The expression becomes:\n\n(x -d)^2 + (y/2 -c)^2.\n\nBut cd=4 → d=4/c.\n\nThus, the expression is:\n\n(x -4/c)^2 + (y/2 -c)^2.\n\nWe need to minimize this over x² + y²=4.\n\nBut this is not the same as the distance from (4/c, c) to (x, y). Instead, it's the distance from (4/c, 2c) to (x, y/2).\n\nWait, no. If we let u=x, v=y/2, then u² + (2v)^2=4 →u² +4v²=4, which is the original ellipse. Then, the expression becomes:\n\n(u -4/c)^2 + (v -c)^2.\n\nSo, the expression is the distance squared from the point (4/c, c) to the point (u, v) on the ellipse u² +4v²=4. Wait, but we initially had the same problem. The earlier approach where I tried to use the circle substitution was incorrect because of miscalculating the coordinates.\n\nTherefore, back to square one. The problem reduces to finding the minimal distance squared between the ellipse a² +4b²=4 and the hyperbola cd=4 (points (d,c)).\n\nThis is a non-trivial optimization problem. Perhaps the minimal occurs when the two points (a,b) and (d,c) are related by some symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, consider using the AM-GM inequality on the expression.\n\nWe need to find the minimum of (a -d)^2 + (b -c)^2.\n\nLet me expand this:\n\na² -2ad +d² +b² -2bc +c².\n\nGiven a² +4b²=4 and cd=4.\n\nExpress a²=4 -4b². Also, since cd=4, d=4/c.\n\nSubstitute:\n\nExpression becomes:\n\n(4 -4b²) -2a*(4/c) + (16/c²) +b² -2bc +c².\n\nSimplify:\n\n4 -3b² -8a/c +16/c² -2bc +c².\n\nThis still has multiple variables. Maybe express a in terms of b from the ellipse equation. a=±2√(1 -b²). But this introduces square roots.\n\nAlternatively, use Lagrange multipliers again but proceed more carefully.\n\nEarlier, we had the system:\n\nFrom the Lagrangian, we arrived at:\n\nb = a /c²,\n\na(1 +λ)=4/c,\n\na(1 +4λ)=c^3.\n\nFrom b =a/c² and a(1 +λ)=4/c, we can write a=4/(c(1 +λ)),\n\nSubstitute into a(1 +4λ)=c^3:\n\n4/(c(1 +λ)) * (1 +4λ)=c^3,\n\n4(1 +4λ)/(c(1 +λ))=c^3,\n\n4(1 +4λ)=c^4(1 +λ).\n\nFrom this equation:\n\n4(1 +4λ)=c^4(1 +λ).\n\nAlso, from a² +4b²=4,\n\na²=4/(c²(1 +λ)^2),\n\n4b²=4a²/c^4=4*(4/(c²(1 +λ)^2))/c^4=16/(c^6(1 +λ)^2).\n\nThus,\n\na² +4b²=4/(c²(1 +λ)^2) +16/(c^6(1 +λ)^2)=4.\n\nFactor out 4/(c^6(1 +λ)^2):\n\n[c^4 +4]/c^6(1 +λ)^2) =1.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe divide numerator and denominator:\n\n4(c^4 +4)/(c^6(1 +lambda)^2)=4.\n\nThus,\n\n(c^4 +4)/(c^6(1 +lambda)^2)=1.\n\nBut from the earlier equation 4(1 +4lambda)=c^4(1 +lambda). Let’s solve for (1 +lambda):\n\n(1 +lambda)=4(1 +4lambda)/c^4.\n\nSubstitute into the above equation:\n\n(c^4 +4)/c^6*(4(1 +4lambda)/c^4)^2)=1.\n\nThis seems too complex. Perhaps make substitution k=lambda.\n\nLet’s denote equation 4(1 +4k)=c^4(1 +k).\n\nExpress 1 +k=4(1 +4k)/c^4.\n\nSubstitute into the equation:\n\n(c^4 +4)/c^6*(4(1 +4k)/c^4)^2)=1.\n\nThis is getting too messy. Perhaps assume that c^4= k some variable.\n\nAlternatively, let’s consider that this problem might have a minimal when the derivative conditions are met with certain symmetry. For example, suppose that c=2b and d=2a. Then cd=4 → 2a*2b=4 →ab=1. Also, from the ellipse a² +4b²=4. So, ab=1 and a² +4b²=4.\n\nLet’s solve these equations:\n\nFrom ab=1 →a=1/b.\n\nSubstitute into a² +4b²=4:\n\n1/b² +4b²=4.\n\nMultiply by b²:\n\n1 +4b^4=4b² →4b^4 -4b² +1=0.\n\nLet’s solve for b²: let x=b²,\n\n4x² -4x +1=0.\n\nDiscriminant=16 -16=0. So x=(4)/(8)=0.5.\n\nThus, b²=0.5 →b=±√0.5=±√2/2≈±0.707.\n\nThen, a=1/b=±√2≈±1.414.\n\nCheck a² +4b²= (2) +4*(0.5)=2 +2=4. Correct.\n\nThen, c=2b=2*(±√2/2)=±√2≈±1.414,\n\nd=2a=2*(±√2)=±2.828.\n\nCheck cd= (√2)(2.828)=√2*(2√2)=4. Correct.\n\nThus, if we take a=√2, b=√2/2, c=√2, d=2√2,\n\nThen, compute the expression:\n\n(a -d)^2 + (b -c)^2=(√2 -2√2)^2 + (√2/2 -√2)^2=(-√2)^2 + (-√2/2)^2=2 + (0.5*2)=2+0.5=2.5.\n\nWhich is 2.5, greater than 1.6. So this is not the minimum.\n\nBut maybe this is not the right assumption. Alternatively, assume that the minimal occurs when the two points are closest along certain directions.\n\nAlternatively, use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality on the terms involving a and d, b and c.\n\nLet me consider that:\n\n(a -d)^2 + (b -c)^2 ≥ [(a -d) + (b -c)]^2 /2.\n\nBut not sure if helpful. Alternatively, expand and use the constraints.\n\nWe have:\n\n(a -d)^2 + (b -c)^2 =a² +d² -2ad +b² +c² -2bc.\n\nUsing a² +4b²=4, so a²=4 -4b². Also, cd=4 ⇒ d=4/c.\n\nSubstitute:\n\n= (4 -4b²) + (16/c²) -2a*(4/c) +b² +c² -2bc.\n\nSimplify:\n\n=4 -3b² +16/c² +c² -8a/c -2bc.\n\nThis expression is still complicated, but perhaps we can find a lower bound.\n\nLet me consider terms involving b and c. Let’s group the terms with b:\n\n-3b² -2bc -8a/c.\n\nBut a= ±2√(1 -b²). Let’s assume a is positive (symmetry), so a=2√(1 -b²).\n\nThus, substitute a=2√(1 -b²):\n\n-3b² -2bc -8*2√(1 -b²)/c.\n\n=-3b² -2bc -16√(1 -b²)/c.\n\nThis expression is quite complex. Maybe bound it using inequalities.\n\nAlternatively, use substitution variables. Let’s set t= b/c. Then, b=ct.\n\nBut cd=4 ⇒ d=4/c.\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, use the AM-GM inequality on the terms 16/c² +c². By AM-GM,\n\n16/c² +c² ≥2√(16/c² *c²)=2*4=8.\n\nEquality when 16/c²=c² ⇒c^4=16 ⇒c²=4 ⇒c=±2. So, the term 16/c² +c² is minimized at 8 when c=±2.\n\nSimilarly, the terms involving b: -3b² -2bc -16√(1 -b²)/c. Let’s consider when c=2, then d=2.\n\nThen, the expression becomes:\n\n4 -3b² +16/4 +4 -8a/2 -2b*2.\n\n=4 -3b² +4 +4 -4a -4b.\n\n=12 -3b² -4a -4b.\n\nBut a=2√(1 -b²), so:\n\n=12 -3b² -4*2√(1 -b²) -4b.\n\n=12 -3b² -8√(1 -b²) -4b.\n\nThis is a function of b. Let’s denote f(b)=12 -3b² -8√(1 -b²) -4b.\n\nWe need to find the minimum of this function for |b| ≤1 (since a² +4b²=4 ⇒ b² ≤1).\n\nTake derivative f’(b)= -6b -8*(1/2)(-2b)/√(1 -b²) -4.\n\nSimplify:\n\nf’(b)= -6b +8b/√(1 -b²) -4.\n\nSet to zero:\n\n-6b +8b/√(1 -b²) -4=0.\n\nThis is still complex, but perhaps try specific b values.\n\nLet’s try b=0:\n\nf’(0)=0 +0 -4= -4≠0.\n\nb=0.5:\n\nf’(0.5)= -3 +8*0.5/√(0.75) -4≈-3 +4/(0.866) -4≈-3 +4.619 -4≈-2.381≠0.\n\nb=0.6:\n\n√(1 -0.36)=√0.64=0.8.\n\nf’(0.6)= -3.6 +8*0.6/0.8 -4= -3.6 +6 -4= -1.6≠0.\n\nb=0.707 (√2/2):\n\n√(1 -0.5)=√0.5≈0.707.\n\nf’(0.707)= -4.242 +8*0.707/0.707 -4≈-4.242 +8 -4≈-0.242≠0.\n\nb=0.8:\n\n√(1 -0.64)=√0.36=0.6.\n\nf’(0.8)= -4.8 +8*0.8/0.6 -4≈-4.8 +10.666 -4≈1.866≠0.\n\nb=0.3:\n\n√(1 -0.09)=√0.91≈0.954.\n\nf’(0.3)= -1.8 +8*0.3/0.954 -4≈-1.8 +2.514 -4≈-3.286≠0.\n\nNot finding zeros. Maybe the minimum occurs at endpoints.\n\nAt b=1:\n\na=0. Then expression=12 -3 -8*0 -4=12-3-0-4=5.\n\nAt b=0:\n\na=2. expression=12 -0 -8*2 -0=12-16= -4. But since other terms are positive, this might not be the case. Wait, but when b=0, the original expression (a-d)^2 + (b-c)^2=(2-2)^2 + (0-2)^2=0 +4=4. So when c=2, d=2, the minimal distance squared is 4. But earlier computation with Lagrange multipliers for c=2 gave distance squared≈2.01, which conflicts. This suggests inconsistency.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal for c=2 is achieved at some b≠0.\n\nBut this approach is getting too involved. Given the time I've spent and the complexity, perhaps the intended solution uses some inequality or geometric interpretation that I'm missing.\n\nWait, the original problem mentions \"innocent inequality\" and \"nice and sweet elementary solutions\". So there must be an elegant approach.\n\nLet me consider using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.\n\nWe need to show that (a -d)^2 + (b -c)^2 ≥1.6.\n\nLet me consider that since cd=4, by AM-GM, c and d have the same sign, and |c| + |d| ≥ 2√(cd)=4. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, use the following identity:\n\n(a -d)^2 + (b -c)^2 = (a^2 + 4b^2) + (c^2 + d^2) -2(ad + bc) -3b².\n\nBut a² +4b²=4, and cd=4, so d=4/c. Also, c² +d²=c² +16/c².\n\nThus,\n\nExpression=4 +c² +16/c² -2(ad + bc) -3b².\n\nBut ad + bc =a*(4/c) +b*c.\n\nWe need to find a lower bound for this expression. Let me attempt to bound the terms.\n\nFirst, c² +16/c² ≥8 by AM-GM.\n\nSo, 4 +8=12. So expression≥12 -2(ad + bc) -3b².\n\nBut need to relate ad + bc and b.\n\nBut ad + bc= (4a)/c + bc.\n\nPerhaps use Cauchy-Schwarz on (4a/c + bc).\n\nLet me consider terms 4a/c and bc. Let me write them as:\n\n4a/c + bc= a*(4/c) +b*c.\n\nLet’s apply Cauchy-Schwarz to the vectors (a, 2b) and (4/c, c/2).\n\nThen,\n\na*(4/c) +2b*(c/2) ≤√(a² +4b²) *√( (16/c²) +c²/4 ).\n\nBut a² +4b²=4, and cd=4 →d=4/c. So,\n\na*(4/c) +b*c ≤√4 *√(16/c² +c²/4)=2*√(16/c² +c²/4).\n\nThus,\n\nad + bc= a*(4/c) +b*c ≤2√(16/c² +c²/4).\n\nTherefore, the expression:\n\n(a -d)^2 + (b -c)^2=4 +c² +16/c² -2(ad + bc) -3b²≥4 +c² +16/c² -4√(16/c² +c²/4) -3b².\n\nBut this still involves b² and c. Not sure if helpful.\n\nAlternatively, since a² +4b²=4, then 4b²≤4 ⇒b²≤1 ⇒-3b²≥-3.\n\nThus,\n\nExpression≥4 +c² +16/c² -4√(16/c² +c²/4) -3.\n\n=1 +c² +16/c² -4√(16/c² +c²/4).\n\nLet’s denote t=c²>0.\n\nThen",
