    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants me to prove that the integral from 0 to 1 of (arcsin(x)/x) dx equals (π/2) ln 2. They also provided their own proof using integration by parts and complex logarithms, but they're looking for alternative methods. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the integral ∫₀¹ (sin⁻¹(x)/x) dx. The integrand is arcsin(x) divided by x. The limits are from 0 to 1. The challenge here is that at x=0, sin⁻¹(x) is 0, and the denominator x is also 0, so there's a 0/0 indeterminate form. But the integral is proper since the limit as x approaches 0 from the right exists. \n\nThe user's approach was substitution u = arcsin(x), leading to integrating u cot(u) du. Then they integrated by parts, which split into another integral involving ln sin(u). They expanded sin(u) using complex exponentials, which introduced polylogarithms. Finally, they evaluated the resulting expression from 0 to 1. Their result was π/2 ln 2, which matches the expected value. \n\nBut the user wants to see alternative solutions. Let me think of different methods. Possible approaches could include series expansion, substitution, differentiation under the integral sign, or maybe using known integral formulas involving inverse trigonometric functions. \n\nLet me consider expanding arcsin(x) as a power series. The Taylor series for arcsin(x) around 0 is known. The expansion is arcsin(x) = Σ_{n=0}^∞ ( (2n)! )/(4^n (n!)^2 (2n+1)) x^{2n+1} for |x| ≤ 1. So if I substitute this into the integral, I get ∫₀¹ [Σ_{n=0}^∞ ( (2n)! )/(4^n (n!)^2 (2n+1)) x^{2n+1} ] / x dx. The x in the denominator cancels with x^{2n+1}, leaving x^{2n}. Then the integral becomes Σ_{n=0}^∞ ( (2n)! )/(4^n (n!)^2 (2n+1)) ∫₀¹ x^{2n} dx. \n\nComputing the integral of x^{2n} from 0 to 1 gives 1/(2n+1). So the sum becomes Σ_{n=0}^∞ ( (2n)! )/(4^n (n!)^2 (2n+1)^2 ). Now, this sum needs to equal π/2 ln 2. But is there a known sum that equals this? Let me recall some series expansions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps integrating by parts differently. Let me try integration by parts again but with a different choice. Let me set u = arcsin(x) and dv = dx/x. Then du = 1/√(1 - x²) dx, and v = ln x. Wait, but integrating dv = dx/x would make v = ln x, so ∫ arcsin(x)/x dx = arcsin(x) ln x - ∫ ln x / √(1 - x²) dx. Hmm, that seems more complicated. Maybe not the best approach. \n\nAlternatively, consider substitution. Let me set t = arcsin(x). Then x = sin t, and dx = cos t dt. The limits when x=0, t=0; x=1, t=π/2. The integral becomes ∫₀^{π/2} t / sin t * cos t dt = ∫₀^{π/2} t cot t dt. So the problem reduces to evaluating ∫₀^{π/2} t cot t dt. \n\nWait, that's actually the same as the user's substitution. They substituted u = arcsin(x), leading to integrating u cot u du. So perhaps integrating t cot t from 0 to π/2. How else can we evaluate this integral? Let's see. Integration by parts again. Let me set u = t, dv = cot t dt. Then du = dt, and v = ln |sin t|. So ∫ t cot t dt = t ln sin t - ∫ ln sin t dt. This is exactly the same as the user's equation (1). So the integral becomes [t ln sin t] from 0 to π/2 minus ∫₀^{π/2} ln sin t dt. \n\nEvaluating the boundary term: at π/2, sin(π/2) = 1, so ln 1 = 0, so the term is (π/2)*0 - 0*ln sin 0. But ln sin 0 is ln 0, which tends to -infty, but multiplied by 0. So the limit as t approaches 0 from the right of t ln sin t. Let's compute lim_{t→0+} t ln sin t. Since sin t ≈ t - t^3/6 + ..., so ln sin t ≈ ln t - t^2/6. Multiply by t: t ln t - t^3/6. The limit as t→0+ is 0 (since t ln t approaches 0). Therefore, the boundary term is 0. \n\nTherefore, the integral becomes - ∫₀^{π/2} ln sin t dt. But the integral of ln sin t from 0 to π/2 is a known result. It's - (π/2) ln 2. Therefore, - [ - (π/2) ln 2 ] = (π/2) ln 2. Hence, the original integral equals (π/2) ln 2. \n\nWait, but that seems much simpler. So why did the user go through all that complex analysis? Maybe they didn't recall the standard integral ∫₀^{π/2} ln sin t dt = - (π/2) ln 2. Let me verify that. \n\nYes, the integral ∫₀^{π/2} ln sin t dt is a classic result. One way to compute it is to use symmetry and substitution. Let me recall: set t = π/2 - u, then the integral becomes ∫₀^{π/2} ln cos u du. Adding the two integrals, 2I = ∫₀^{π/2} (ln sin t + ln cos t) dt = ∫₀^{π/2} ln (sin t cos t) dt = ∫₀^{π/2} ln (sin 2t / 2) dt = ∫₀^{π/2} ln sin 2t dt - ∫₀^{π/2} ln 2 dt. Let’s substitute in the first integral: let s = 2t, so when t=0, s=0; t=π/2, s=π. Then ∫₀^{π} ln sin s (ds/2) - (π/2) ln 2. The integral from 0 to π of ln sin s ds is known to be -π ln 2. Therefore, 2I = (1/2)(-π ln 2) - (π/2) ln 2 = - (π/2) ln 2 - (π/2) ln 2 = -π ln 2. Hence, 2I = -π ln 2 ⇒ I = - (π/2) ln 2. Therefore, ∫₀^{π/2} ln sin t dt = - (π/2) ln 2. \n\nSo applying this back to our problem, the integral ∫₀^{1} (arcsin x)/x dx becomes ∫₀^{π/2} t cot t dt = - ∫₀^{π/2} ln sin t dt = - (-π/2 ln 2) = π/2 ln 2. Hence, proven. \n\nThis seems like a more straightforward approach using the known integral of ln sin t. So maybe the user's method was more complicated because they didn't recall that standard result and tried to compute the integral from scratch using series expansions or polylogarithms. \n\nAlternatively, another method could involve using substitution and series expansion. Let me explore that. Starting from the original integral ∫₀¹ (arcsin x)/x dx. As I considered before, expand arcsin x as a power series. The Taylor series expansion of arcsin x around x=0 is Σ_{n=0}^∞ [ (2n)! / (4^n (n!)^2 (2n + 1)) ] x^{2n + 1}. Then dividing by x gives Σ_{n=0}^∞ [ (2n)! / (4^n (n!)^2 (2n + 1)) ] x^{2n}. Integrating term by term from 0 to 1 gives Σ_{n=0}^∞ [ (2n)! / (4^n (n!)^2 (2n + 1)) ] ∫₀¹ x^{2n} dx = Σ_{n=0}^∞ [ (2n)! / (4^n (n!)^2 (2n + 1)^2 ) ]. \n\nNow, we need to compute this sum and show that it equals π/2 ln 2. But is there a known representation for this series? Let me recall that the dilogarithm function Li₂(z) is defined as Σ_{n=1}^∞ z^n / n². However, our series involves terms with (2n)!/(4^n (n!)^2 (2n +1)^2 ). Let's see if this can be related to known series. \n\nAlternatively, recognizing that (2n)!/(4^n (n!)^2) is the central binomial coefficient divided by 4^n, which is (1/4^n) * C(2n, n). The central binomial coefficient is (2n)!/(n!)^2. So the term becomes [C(2n, n)/4^n] * 1/(2n +1)^2. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps expressing this series in terms of integrals. Note that 1/(2n +1)^2 can be written as ∫₀¹ x^{2n} dx * ∫₀¹ y^{2n} dy. Wait, that might complicate things. \n\nAlternatively, recall that the integral ∫₀¹ arcsin x /x dx can be related to the integral of t cot t dt, which we already converted to the known integral of ln sin t. But perhaps another substitution. Let me try x = sin θ, then dx = cos θ dθ, so the integral becomes ∫₀^{π/2} θ / sin θ * cos θ dθ = ∫₀^{π/2} θ cot θ dθ, which is the same as before. So integrating by parts here gives the same result. \n\nAlternatively, consider differentiating under the integral sign. Let me define I(a) = ∫₀¹ (arcsin(a x))/x dx. Then differentiate I(a) with respect to a. Then I'(a) = ∫₀¹ [ (x / sqrt(1 - a²x²)) / x ] dx = ∫₀¹ 1 / sqrt(1 - a²x²) dx. Substitute u = a x, then du = a dx, so dx = du/a. When x=0, u=0; x=1, u=a. So I'(a) = ∫₀^a 1 / sqrt(1 - u²) * (du/a) ) = (1/a) arcsin(u) from 0 to a = (1/a)(arcsin(a) - 0) = arcsin(a)/a. \n\nWait, but that seems incorrect. Let me check that again. Differentiating I(a) = ∫₀¹ arcsin(a x)/x dx with respect to a:\n\ndI/da = ∫₀¹ [ d/da (arcsin(a x)) ] /x dx = ∫₀¹ [ (x / sqrt(1 - a²x²)) ] /x dx = ∫₀¹ 1 / sqrt(1 - a²x²) dx.\n\nYes, that's correct. So I'(a) = ∫₀¹ 1 / sqrt(1 - a²x²) dx. Let's compute that integral. Substitute x = (1/a) sin θ, so dx = (1/a) cos θ dθ. When x=0, θ=0; x=1, θ=arcsin(a). Then I'(a) = ∫₀^{arcsin(a)} 1 / sqrt(1 - a²*(1/a² sin²θ)) * (1/a cos θ) dθ. Simplify inside the square root: sqrt(1 - sin²θ) = cos θ. So I'(a) = ∫₀^{arcsin(a)} (1/a cos θ) / cos θ * cos θ dθ. Wait, let me re-express:\n\nWait, inside the integral, we have 1 / sqrt(1 - a²x²) dx. With x = (1/a) sin θ, so dx = (1/a) cos θ dθ. Then:\n\nsqrt(1 - a²x²) = sqrt(1 - sin²θ) = cos θ. So 1/sqrt(1 - a²x²) = 1/cos θ.\n\nTherefore, I'(a) = ∫₀^{arcsin(a)} [1 / cos θ] * (1/a cos θ) dθ = ∫₀^{arcsin(a)} (1/a) dθ = (1/a) arcsin(a).\n\nTherefore, I'(a) = (1/a) arcsin(a). Therefore, to find I(a), we need to integrate I'(a) = (1/a) arcsin(a) with respect to a. Given that I(0) = 0, since arcsin(0) = 0. \n\nSo, I(a) = ∫₀^a [ (1/t) arcsin(t) ] dt + C. But since I(0) = 0, the constant C is 0. Therefore, the original integral I(1) is equal to ∫₀¹ [arcsin(t)/t] dt, which is the same as our original problem. But this seems circular. \n\nWait, but this approach leads us to I(a) = ∫₀^a [arcsin(t)/t] dt, which is the same as the original integral when a=1. Hmm, so differentiating under the integral sign didn't help here; it just re-expressed the same integral. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps changing variables. Let me consider substituting x = sin θ, as before, leading to ∫₀^{π/2} θ cot θ dθ. Then, expand cot θ as cos θ / sin θ. So the integral becomes ∫ θ (cos θ / sin θ) dθ. Alternatively, write this as ∫ θ d/dθ (ln sin θ) dθ. Then integrating by parts, let u = θ, dv = d/dθ (ln sin θ) dθ. Then du = dθ, v = ln sin θ. So ∫ θ d/dθ (ln sin θ) dθ = θ ln sin θ - ∫ ln sin θ dθ. Which again is the same as before. So we end up with the same result. \n\nThus, it seems that the most straightforward method is to use integration by parts once, reducing the integral to the known integral of ln sin θ, which equals - (π/2) ln 2. Therefore, multiplying by -1 gives the desired result. \n\nAnother alternative approach: Fourier series. The integral of ln sin θ can also be evaluated using Fourier series. Expand ln sin θ into its Fourier series and integrate term by term. However, this might be more involved. \n\nAlternatively, using beta or gamma functions. But I'm not sure how that would directly apply here. \n\nAlternatively, consider the substitution t = π/2 - θ in the integral ∫₀^{π/2} θ cot θ dθ. Then θ = π/2 - t, and the integral becomes ∫₀^{π/2} (π/2 - t) tan t dt. Adding the original integral and this one: \n\nLet I = ∫₀^{π/2} θ cot θ dθ, and I’ = ∫₀^{π/2} (π/2 - t) tan t dt. Then I + I’ = ∫₀^{π/2} [θ cot θ + (π/2 - θ) tan θ] dθ. Maybe this simplifies? Let's see: \n\nθ cot θ + (π/2 - θ) tan θ = θ (cot θ + tan θ) + (π/2) tan θ - θ tan θ. Wait, cot θ + tan θ = (cos θ / sin θ) + (sin θ / cos θ) = (cos²θ + sin²θ)/(sin θ cos θ) = 1/(sin θ cos θ). So θ (cot θ + tan θ) = θ / (sin θ cos θ). \n\nBut this seems to complicate things further. Maybe this approach isn't helpful. \n\nAlternatively, consider expanding cot θ into a series. cot θ = 1/θ - θ/3 - θ³/45 - ... for small θ, but integrating over 0 to π/2 might not be straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, use the substitution z = e^{iθ} in the integral ∫ ln sin θ dθ. But this leads to complex analysis, which might be similar to what the original poster did. \n\nGiven all these approaches, the simplest method seems to be integration by parts once, reducing to the known integral ∫₀^{π/2} ln sin θ dθ = - (π/2) ln 2. Therefore, the original integral evaluates to π/2 ln 2. \n\nSo, to structure the problem according to the user's format, we need to list the assumptions and the problem. The original problem is to prove that ∫₀¹ (sin⁻¹(x)/x dx = (π/2) ln 2. \n\nAssumptions here are regarding the function's domain and the integral's existence. However, the problem as stated doesn’t have explicit assumptions beyond the integral's limits and the function's definition. But looking at the example provided, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. The user formatted it to list each assumption line by line. \n\nIn this case, the integral is from 0 to 1, and the integrand is arcsin(x)/x. The assumptions would be:\n\n- The variable x is real.\n- The integral is taken over the interval [0, 1].\n- arcsin(x) is the inverse sine function.\n- The integrand is defined for x in (0, 1], and the integral is an improper integral at x=0.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. For this problem, perhaps:\n\nAssumptions:\n- x is a real number in the interval [0, 1],\n- The integral is an improper integral at x=0,\n- arcsin(x) is the inverse sine function with range [-π/2, π/2].\n\nBut the original problem statement doesn’t mention these explicitly; they are part of the problem's context. The user's example included assumptions that were perhaps part of the problem's original conditions but weren’t stated in the problem. Wait, the original example had the problem statement as proving A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted assumption added that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, which might not be in the original problem. Wait, wait, looking back:\n\nThe original problem in the example was:\n\nProve that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nBut in the formatted version, the assumptions were:\n\n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$A(n) = ...$$ is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, this seems contradictory. The original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption adds that n is divisible by 7. That changes the problem. Perhaps there was a mistake in the example. \n\nBut according to the user's instruction, they want to \"filter the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format\". So perhaps the original problem had some extraneous information, and the formatted version lists the actual assumptions needed. \n\nIn our current problem, the original post's question is to prove the integral equals π/2 ln 2. The user's proof involved integration by parts and complex logs, but the actual assumptions for the problem are standard: the integral is over [0,1], arcsin(x) is the inverse sine function, and the integral is proper (even though it's an improper integral at 0). However, in the example, assumptions were listed even if they were part of the problem's original statement. \n\nBut perhaps the assumptions here are minimal. The problem is to prove the integral equals π/2 ln 2. The necessary assumptions are about the function's domain and the integral's limits. So:\n\nAssumption:\nx is in the interval [0, 1],\narcsin(x) is defined with range [-π/2, π/2],\nthe integral is improper at x=0 and is convergent.\n\nBut according to the example's structure, each assumption is on a separate line and addresses only one property. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe variable x is in the interval [0, 1],\narcsin(x) is the inverse sine function with range restricted to [-π/2, π/2],\nthe integral is taken as an improper integral at x=0.\n\nBut I'm not sure if the problem requires specifying these assumptions explicitly, but according to the user's example, we need to list them. So the formatted problem would have these assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the final answer structured as per the user's format would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nx is a real number in the interval [0, 1],\narcsin(x) is the inverse sine function with range [-π/2, π/2],\nthe integral is an improper integral at x=0.\nProblem: \nProve that\n$$\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{\\sin^{-1}(x)}{x} \\, dx = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\ln 2.$$\n###",
