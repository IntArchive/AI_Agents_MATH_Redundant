    "Content": "Disclaimer:  Though I have been re-reading my notes, and have scanned the relevant texts, my commutative algebra is quite rusty, so I may be overlooking something basic. I want to show $\\mathbb{Q} \\simeq \\mathbb{Q}[x,y]/\\langle x,y \\rangle$ is not projective as a $\\mathbb{Q}[x,y]$ module.  I've tried two methods, neither of which gets me to the conclusion. I first tried what seems to be sort of standard when proving that something is not projective: show that the lifting of the identity yields a contradiction.  So I let $\\pi: \\mathbb{Q}[x,y] \\to \\mathbb{Q}[x,y]/\\langle x,y \\rangle$ be my surjection given by $f \\mapsto \\bar{f}$ and the identity map is $id:  \\mathbb{Q}[x,y]/\\langle x,y \\rangle \\to \\mathbb{Q}[x,y]/\\langle x,y \\rangle$. So all I need to show is that a homomorphism $\\phi: \\mathbb{Q}[x,y]/\\langle x,y \\rangle \\to \\mathbb{Q}[x,y]$ such that $\\pi \\circ \\phi =id$ does not exist.  But if $$\\pi(f) = \\bar{f} = \\overline{a_0+a_{10}x+a_{01}y+a_{11}xy+\\cdots+a_{n0}x^n + a_{0n}y^n} = \\bar{a_0}$$ then doesn't the map $\\bar{a_0} \\mapsto a_0$ work?  After all, $$ (\\pi\\circ \\phi)(\\bar{a_0}) = \\pi(a_0) = \\bar{a_0} = id(\\bar{a_0}).$$I was concerned at first about this not being well defined, but since every element of a particular coset has the same constant term, it does not depend on choice.  So either I have already made a mistake, or this is just the wrong map from which to derive a contradiction. The next thing I tried used a different characterization of projective modules: that $P$ is a projective $R$-module iff there is a free module $F$ and an $R$-module $K$ such that $F \\simeq K\\oplus P$. In our case, this means there is a free module $F$ and a $\\mathbb{Q}[x,y]$-module $K$ such that \n$$\n\\mathbb{Q}[x,y] \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus \\mathbb{Q}[x,y] \\simeq F \\simeq K \\oplus \\mathbb{Q}[x,y]/\\langle x,y \\rangle \\simeq K \\oplus \\mathbb{Q}.$$\nFrom here, my concern is that I am waving my hand too much when I say: obviously this cannot be true, since every element of the LHS, which is a tuple of polynomials, cannot be broken up with one chunk in $K$ and the other in $\\mathbb{Q}$.  Do agree?  If so, how can I make this argument more rigorous? One more trouble: nowhere in either of these methods did I explicitly use that the polynomial ring here is only in two variables.  The fact that the question did not use $\\mathbb{Q}[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]$ instead of $\\mathbb{Q}[x,y]$ worries me.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "As Steve D said, you can use the fact that projective modules are always flat. Consider the map $\\mathbb{Q}[x,y]\\to \\mathbb{Q}[x,y]$ defined by multiplying $x$. This is an injective $\\mathbb{Q}[x,y]$-module map, while tensoring $\\mathbb{Q}$ will give an injective map, but it is NOT. So $\\mathbb{Q}$ is not flat as $\\mathbb{Q}[x,y]$-module. However, following by your methods. The map defined in your first method is not a $\\mathbb{Q}[x,y]$-module map, since if $1$ sends to $1$, then $0=\\overline{x}$ sends to $x=0$, contradiction. In your second method, you can always find an element $(0,1)$ in RHS, this element is a torsion element, $x(0,1)=0$. But there is no element in LHS corresponding to it, since every element in LHS is not torsion.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants to show that the module Q = Q[x,y]/⟨x,y⟩ is not projective over Q[x,y]. I need to structure their problem into the specified format.\n\nFirst, looking at the original question, the user tried two approaches. The first was using the lifting property: if Q were projective, then the identity map on Q would lift to a homomorphism φ: Q → Q[x,y] such that π∘φ = id. They considered mapping the coset of a constant term a0 to a0 in Q[x,y]. They thought this works, but that contradicts the conclusion, so maybe there's a mistake here.\n\nThe second approach was using the property that projective modules are direct summands of free modules. The user argues that if Q were projective, then some free module F would be isomorphic to K ⊕ Q. But F would be a free Q[x,y]-module, and K ⊕ Q would have a copy of Q, which is a Q-vector space, but Q[x,y] is a Q-algebra with x and y acting non-trivially. So elements in Q would have to be annihilated by x and y, but in a free module, x and y act injectively. That might be a contradiction.\n\nWait, but how to formalize that? Maybe tensor with Q[x,y]/(x,y) and compare dimensions? But Q[x,y] is infinite-dimensional, while Q is 1-dimensional. Alternatively, using the fact that projective modules over polynomial rings (which are Noetherian) have certain properties, like being locally free. But Q is a module where x and y act as zero, so its localization at (x,y) would be Q itself, which is a vector space, but maybe not free over the local ring? Hmm.\n\nBut the user's main problem is structuring the original question into the Assumption and Problem format. Let me re-read the original problem.\n\nThe user wants to show that Q[x,y]/⟨x,y⟩ (which is isomorphic to Q) is not projective as a Q[x,y]-module. The assumptions would be:\n\n- The ring is Q[x,y].\n- The module is Q[x,y]/⟨x,y⟩, which is a Q-vector space.\n- The problem is to prove that this module is not projective over Q[x,y].\n\nWait, but in the example given, the assumption included that n is divisible by 7. Here, the key assumptions are the ring (Q[x,y]), the module in question (Q), and perhaps the structure of the module (since it's a quotient by the ideal generated by x and y). So the assumptions would be:\n\n- The base ring is Q[x,y].\n- The module M is Q[x,y]/⟨x, y⟩.\n- M is isomorphic to Q as a Q-vector space.\n- Projectivity is considered over Q[x,y]-modules.\n\nBut the problem is to show that M is not projective. So the structured problem should list the relevant assumptions and then the problem statement.\n\nWait, the example given had two assumptions: n is integer and n divisible by 7. But here, the assumptions are about the ring and the module structure.\n\nSo maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe ring is Q[x,y],\nThe module is Q[x,y]/⟨x, y⟩,\nQ[x,y]/⟨x, y⟩ is isomorphic to Q as a Q-vector space.\n\nProblem:\nShow that Q[x,y]/⟨x, y⟩ is not projective as a Q[x,y]-module.\n\nBut maybe more precise. The key assumptions are that we are working over Q[x,y], and the module is the quotient by the maximal ideal (x,y), which is a simple module. The problem is to prove it's not projective. So the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nR = Q[x,y] is the polynomial ring in two variables over Q,\nM = R/⟨x, y⟩,\nM is considered as an R-module.\n\nProblem:\nProve that M is not projective as an R-module.\n\nThat seems to capture the essential parts. The user's own attempts involved using the lifting property and the direct summand property. The key points are that for a projective module, there must be a splitting, but in this case, any map from M to R would send 1 to a constant polynomial (since x and y act as zero on M), but constants in R are not sufficient to generate M as a direct summand because multiplying by x or y would kill them. Alternatively, using the fact that projective modules over Noetherian rings have certain properties, like being locally free. Since M is killed by x and y, its localization at (x,y) is M itself, which is a one-dimensional vector space over the residue field, but the localized ring R_(x,y) is a local ring, and M localized there is not free because R_(x,y) has higher dimension. Therefore, M is not projective.\n\nBut for the structured problem, the user just needs the assumptions and the problem. The original question mentions that they tried lifting the identity map and considering direct summands. But in the formatted problem, we need to extract the essential assumptions and problem statement without the user's attempts.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe ring is $\\mathbb{Q}[x,y]$,\nThe module is $\\mathbb{Q}[x,y]/\\langle x, y \\rangle$,\n$\\mathbb{Q}[x,y]/\\langle x, y \\rangle$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Q}$ as a $\\mathbb{Q}$-vector space.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $\\mathbb{Q}[x,y]/\\langle x, y \\rangle$ is not projective as a $\\mathbb{Q}[x,y]$-module.\n\nAlternatively, since the module structure is given by the quotient, maybe the assumptions can be simplified. Let me check the example again. The example had \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". So each assumption is a single condition on a single object. Here, the ring is Q[x,y], the module is the quotient by the ideal generated by x and y, and maybe the problem is to show it's not projective. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n$R = \\mathbb{Q}[x,y]$,\n$M = R/\\langle x, y \\rangle$,\n$M$ is considered as an $R$-module.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $M$ is not projective as an $R$-module.\n\nBut perhaps more precise. Maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n$R$ is the polynomial ring $\\mathbb{Q}[x,y]$,\n$I$ is the ideal $\\langle x, y \\rangle$ of $R$,\n$M$ is the quotient module $R/I$,\n$M$ is considered as an $R$-module.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $M$ is not a projective $R$-module.\n\nThis way, each assumption is one condition on one object. The first line defines R, the second defines I, the third defines M as the quotient, and the fourth specifies M is an R-module. Then the problem is to prove M is not projective.\n\nYes, this follows the example structure where each assumption is a single property. So I think this would be correct.",
