    "Content": "For all $n\\geq 1$ and $m\\geq0$ , I'm trying to prove that $\\sum_{k=0}^n\\sum_{l=0}^m\\binom{n}{k}\\binom{m}{l}\\frac{(n-k)!(m-l)!}{(n+m-k-l+1)!}(-1)^l B_{k+l}=0$ where $B_n$ are the Bernoulli numbers with $B_{1}=-\\frac{1}{2}$ . I made a couple of attempts using the recursive relationship of Bernoulli numbers and induction, but unsuccessful. Now I'm wondering if this is a viable proof strategy. Any comments are appreciated! Edit: This is a conjecture, I evaluated it numerically for $n,m\\leq 20$ .",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The instructive derivation of @RenéGy reduces OPs problem to show the nice symmetric Bernoulli number identity: \\begin{align*}\n\\color{blue}{(-1)^n \\sum_{g=0}^m}&\\color{blue}{ \\binom{m}{g}\\frac{B_{n+g+1}}{n+g+1}\n+(-1)^m \\sum_{g=0}^n \\binom{n}{g}\\frac{B_{m+g+1}}{m+g+1}}\\\\\n&\\color{blue}{= - \\frac{1}{(n+m+1){\\binom{n+m}{m}}}}\\tag{1}\n\\end{align*} Here we show the identity (1) follows from Theorem 2 in Bernoulli Numbers and a New Binomial Transform Identity by H.W. Gould. Given a sequence $(a_n)_{n\\geq 0}$ we consider the sequence of binomial transforms $(b_n)_{n\\geq 0}$ . We so have the binomial inverse pair \\begin{align*}\nb_n=\\sum_{k=0}^n\\binom{n}{k}a_k\\qquad\\mathrm{and}\\qquad a_n=\\sum_{k=0}^n(-1)^{n-k}\\binom{n}{k}b_k\\tag{2}\n\\end{align*} Setting $a_k=B_k$ , the $k$ -th Bernoulli number we have thanks to a well known recursion formula of the Bernoulli numbers the binomial inverse pair \\begin{align*}\na_k=B_k\\quad\\mathrm{and}\\quad  b_n=\\sum_{k=0}^n\\binom{n}{k}a_k=\\sum_{k=0}^n\\binom{n}{k}B_k=(-1)^nB_n\\qquad\\qquad n\\geq 0\n\\end{align*} Theorem 2 in the paper states the following identity for binomial inverse pairs: \\begin{align*}\n\\sum_{k=0}^m\\frac{\\binom{m}{k}}{\\binom{n+k+s}{s}}a_{n+k+s}\n&=\\sum_{k=0}^n(-1)^{n-k}\\frac{\\binom{n}{k}}{\\binom{m+k+s}{s}}b_{m+k+s}\\\\\n&\\quad+\\sum_{j=0}^{s-1}\\sum_{i=0}^{s-1-j}\\binom{s-1-j}{i}\\binom{s-1}{j}\\frac{(-1)^{n+1+i}sa_j}{(m+n+1+i)\\binom{m+n+i}{n}}\n\\end{align*} Setting $s=1$ the identity reduces to \\begin{align*}\n\\sum_{k=0}^m\\binom{m}{k}\\frac{a_{n+k+1}}{n+k+1}&=\\sum_{k=0}^n(-1)^{n-k}\\binom{n}{k}\\frac{b_{m+k+1}}{m+k+1}\\\\\n&\\qquad+\\frac{(-1)^{n+1}a_0}{(m+n+1)\\binom{m+n}{n}}\\tag{3}\n\\end{align*} Putting the Bernoulli numbers (2) in (3) we obtain with $a_0=B_0=1$ : \\begin{align*}\n\\sum_{k=0}^m\\binom{m}{k}\\frac{B_{n+k+1}}{n+k+1}\n&=\\sum_{k=0}^n(-1)^{n-k}\\binom{n}{k}\\frac{(-1)^{m+k+1}B_{m+k+1}}{m+k+1}\\\\\n&\\qquad+\\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{(m+n+1)\\binom{m+n}{n}}\\\\\n\\color{blue}{(-1)^n\\sum_{k=0}^m\\binom{m}{k}\\frac{B_{n+k+1}}{n+k+1}}\n&\\color{blue}{=\\sum_{k=0}^n\\binom{n}{k}\\frac{(-1)^{m+1}B_{m+k+1}}{m+k+1}}\\\\\n&\\qquad\\color{blue}{-\\frac{1}{(m+n+1)\\binom{m+n}{n}}}\n\\end{align*} and the claim (1) follows.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions and then state the problem clearly.\n\nThe original title and question mention a summation involving binomial coefficients, factorials, and Bernoulli numbers. The equation to prove is:\n\n∑ₖ₌₀^n ∑ₗ₌₀^m [C(n,k)C(m,l) * (n−k)!(m−l)! / (n+m−k−l+1)! * (-1)^l B_{k+l}] = 0\n\nfor all n ≥ 1 and m ≥ 0. The Bernoulli numbers B_n are involved, with a note that B₁ = -1/2. The user tried induction and recursive relationships without success and checked it numerically up to n,m ≤ 20.\n\nFirst, the assumptions. The problem states \"for all n ≥ 1 and m ≥ 0\", so those are two separate assumptions. Then, the Bernoulli numbers B_{k+l} are used, with a specific mention that B₁ = -1/2. Wait, but Bernoulli numbers have B₁ = -1/2 in some conventions, but maybe this is an important condition here. Also, the identity involves sums over k and l with binomial coefficients and factorials. The problem is to prove the identity holds under these conditions.\n\nSo, listing the assumptions:\n\n1. n is an integer such that n ≥ 1.\n2. m is an integer such that m ≥ 0.\n3. B_{k+l} are Bernoulli numbers with B₁ = -1/2.\n\nEach of these addresses one condition: the ranges of n and m, and the specific Bernoulli number convention. Then the problem is to prove the given double summation equals zero under these assumptions.\n\nWait, but the original problem statement already includes these conditions. The user mentions \"for all n ≥1, m ≥0\" and specifies B₁ = -1/2. So those are the key assumptions. The problem is to show that under these conditions, the sum equals zero. The rest of the terms (like the binomial coefficients, factorials, etc.) are part of the problem statement, not assumptions. So in the Assumption section, only the conditions on n, m, and the Bernoulli numbers' definition (specifically B₁) are listed.\n\nSo formatted:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer with n ≥ 1,\nm is an integer with m ≥ 0,\nBernoulli numbers B_{k+l} are defined with B₁ = -1/2.\n\nProblem:\nProve that for all n ≥ 1 and m ≥ 0,\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^n \\sum_{l=0}^m \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{m}{l} \\frac{(n-k)! (m-l)!}{(n + m - k - l + 1)!} (-1)^l B_{k+l} = 0\n$$\n\nI need to check if there are any other assumptions. The problem mentions using induction and recursive relationships, but those are attempts, not part of the problem's conditions. The user also states it's a conjecture verified numerically, but that's context, not an assumption. So the main assumptions are the ranges of n and m and the Bernoulli number convention. Hence, the above formatting should be correct.",
