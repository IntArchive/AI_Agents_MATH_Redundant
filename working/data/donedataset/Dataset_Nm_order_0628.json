    "Content": "I read that any continuous function can be represented as a sum of convex and concave function, meaning for all $f(x)$, $f(x) = g(x) + h(x)$ where $g$ is convex and $h$ is concave. There could be infinitely many decompositions of that sort. Anyone knows where I can see a proof or this, or knows of a proof of this? Thanks.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If $f$ is $C^2$ (meaning the derivatives $f'$ and $f''$ are defined and continuous), and if $f$ is defined on a closed interval like $[0,1]$, then there is an easy solution. Since $f''$ is continuous, it has a minimal value $m$. Choose $c$ positive and greater than $m$. Then $f(x)+c x^2/2$ is convex, by the double derivative test, and $-c x^2$ is concave. Of course, $[f(x)+c x^2/2] + [-cx^2/2] = f(x)$. It shouldn't be too much harder to do a general continuous function, but I don't see it right now.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so the user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. Let me start by understanding the original problem.\n\nThe question is about whether any continuous function can be represented as the sum of a convex and a concave function. The user mentioned that there could be infinitely many such decompositions and is asking for a proof reference or an explanation.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The original problem states \"any continuous function,\" so the main assumption here is that the function f is continuous. The problem then is to prove that this f can be expressed as g + h where g is convex and h is concave.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property. Here, the key points are:\n\n1. f is a continuous function.\n2. The decomposition f = g + h exists.\n3. g is convex.\n4. h is concave.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to show that such a decomposition exists for any continuous f. So the assumption is that f is continuous, and the problem is to prove the existence of g and h with those properties. The example given in the original question didn't include the existence as an assumption but rather as part of the problem. So in the example, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7, then the problem was to prove divisibility by 91.\n\nApplying that here: the assumption should be that f is continuous. The problem is to prove that f can be expressed as the sum of a convex function g and a concave function h. The other parts (like the existence of decomposition and the properties of g and h) are part of the problem statement, not assumptions.\n\nSo the assumption line here is just \"f is a continuous function.\" The problem is to show that f = g + h with g convex and h concave. The user also mentions there are infinitely many decompositions, but the main problem is the existence, so maybe that's part of the problem statement.\n\nWait, in the original example, the assumption included two points: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in the problem, the user wrote \"for every integer n\", which in the formatted problem became assumptions. So maybe in the current problem, the only assumption is that f is continuous. Then the problem is to prove that f can be decomposed into g + h with g convex and h concave. The fact that there are infinitely many decompositions might be an additional part, but the main problem is the existence. The user's question is about the proof of the existence, so maybe the problem statement should just focus on that.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a continuous function.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f can be represented as a sum of a convex function g and a concave function h, i.e., f(x) = g(x) + h(x).\n\nBut the original question mentions \"any continuous function\" which is the assumption. The problem is to prove the decomposition. The example included the function's form in the problem statement. Here, the function f is given, and the decomposition is required. So I think that's correct. The user's example didn't list the conclusion as part of the assumption but the initial conditions. So here, the assumption is f is continuous, and the problem is to prove the decomposition exists.",
