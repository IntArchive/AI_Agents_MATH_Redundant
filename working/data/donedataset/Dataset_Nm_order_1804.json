    "Content": "I read somewhere that I can prove this identity below with abstract algebra in a simpler and faster way without any calculations, is that true or am I wrong? $$(a-b)^3 + (b-c)^3 + (c-a)^3 -3(a-b)(b-c)(c-a) = 0$$ Thanks",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The easiest way to show this is by observing that the sum of cubes is such that all the cubed terms cancel, so it is quadratic in each variable individually; then notice that the sum of cubes vanishes for $a=b,c$ and for $b=c$. Consequently it must factorize as $(a-b)(a-c)(b-c)\\times d$ for some $d$. (Why? One gets $f(b,c)\\times (a-b)(a-c)$ by thinking of it in terms of a quadratic in $a$; then the form of $f$ follows by thinking in terms of $b$ or simply symmetry.) Letting $a,b,c=0,1,2$ tells you the constant. Alternatively, note that $(a-b)$ must be a factor, so by cyclic symmetry $(a-b)(b-c)(c-a)$ must be. The result can be deduced similarly from the above.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about proving an algebraic identity without calculations, using abstract algebra. The user provided an example where assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions from the problem. The problem states the equation: (a−b)³ + (b−c)³ + (c−a)³ −3(a−b)(b−c)(c−a) = 0. The user mentions using abstract algebra to prove this without calculations, so maybe there's an assumption here about the structure or properties involved. However, the problem as stated doesn't specify any particular conditions on a, b, c. The example given in the user's previous formatting included specific conditions like n being an integer and divisible by 7, but in this case, the variables a, b, c are just arbitrary elements. \n\nSince the identity is supposed to hold for all a, b, c, the assumptions might be that a, b, c are elements of a ring or field where the algebraic manipulations hold, but the problem doesn't specify this. The question is more about the method (using abstract algebra) rather than conditions on a, b, c. However, the example included assumptions even if they were general (like n being an integer). Here, maybe the assumption is that a, b, c are elements of a commutative ring, since the identity involves symmetric expressions and expanding them would require commutative properties. But the original problem doesn't state this explicitly. Alternatively, maybe there are no specific assumptions beyond a, b, c being variables in some algebraic structure where the operations are valid. \n\nThe problem as presented in the Math Stack Exchange question doesn't list any conditions, so perhaps the only assumption is that a, b, c are elements for which the operations are defined, which in algebra usually means elements of a ring. But since the user's example included even basic assumptions like \"n is an integer\", maybe here the assumption is simply that a, b, c are elements of a commutative ring. Alternatively, the problem might not require any specific assumptions beyond the variables being real or complex numbers. However, the user's example didn't include such assumptions unless necessary. \n\nWait, in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer, even though the divisibility by 91 might require more. But the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. In this current problem, there are no such conditions on a, b, c. The identity is algebraic and holds universally. So perhaps the only assumption here is that a, b, c are elements of a commutative ring. But the original problem doesn't state that. The user's example extracted assumptions from the problem statement. Here, the problem statement doesn't specify any restrictions on a, b, c, so maybe there are no specific assumptions to list. However, the user's format requires listing assumptions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumption is that the operations are performed in a ring where the characteristic allows the identity to hold. But I think the identity is true in any ring, regardless of characteristic. For example, in any commutative ring, expanding the left side would yield zero. So perhaps the assumption is that a, b, c are elements of a commutative ring. However, the problem doesn't mention this. The user might expect that since the problem is about an algebraic identity, the assumption is that a, b, c are elements for which the expression is valid, i.e., in a ring. But the user's example didn't mention that for the previous problem; instead, they listed specific conditions. \n\nWait, in the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, actually, looking back, the original example's formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But the original problem in the example states \"for every integer n\", so maybe the user made a mistake there. Because if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", then the assumption should be \"n is an integer\", but the formatted problem includes \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, that seems incorrect. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. Formatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that contradicts. If the original problem says \"for every integer n\", then the assumption should not include \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like an error in the example. Therefore, perhaps the user's example has a mistake, and the formatted problem's assumptions should only include \"n is an integer\". But the user's example includes \"n is divisible by 7\", which might be part of the problem's conditions. Wait, maybe the original problem was different. Let me reread the example.\n\nThe original problem in the example says: \"Prove that for every integer $n$, the number [...] is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem lists assumptions: $n$ is an integer, $n$ is divisible by 7. But that's a conflict because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", not restricted to multiples of 7. So this suggests that maybe the example is incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the user's example is flawed, and we shouldn't take it as a perfect example. Therefore, in the current problem, we need to list assumptions, but the problem as given doesn't have explicit assumptions beyond the variables being elements where the operations make sense. But since the user requires assumptions, maybe we have to state that a, b, c are elements of a commutative ring or just variables in a certain algebraic structure. Alternatively, if the problem is over the real numbers, we can state that a, b, c are real numbers. But the problem doesn't specify. However, the user's example included \"n is an integer\" even though the problem stated \"for every integer n\", so perhaps in this case, the assumption is that a, b, c are elements of a ring (since the identity is algebraic and holds in general). Therefore, the assumption would be: \"a, b, c are elements of a commutative ring.\" However, the user's example lists each assumption line by line, each applying to one object. So maybe each variable is an element of a ring. But that would be redundant. Alternatively, since the problem is algebraic, perhaps the only assumption is that a, b, c are elements of a ring where the operations are defined. But I'm not sure. The problem as stated doesn't specify any restrictions, so perhaps there are no explicit assumptions besides the variables being elements of a mathematical structure where the expression is valid. However, since the user requires assumptions to be listed, and the example included even redundant ones, maybe in this case, the assumption is just that a, b, c are elements of a commutative ring. Alternatively, maybe there are no specific assumptions, but the user's format requires assumptions, so perhaps we need to state that there are no additional assumptions beyond the variables being elements for which the expression is defined. But the example shows that even when the original problem states \"for every integer n\", it's listed as an assumption. Therefore, here, the assumption is that a, b, c are elements of a ring (or real numbers, complex numbers, etc.), but since it's an algebraic identity, it's generally true in any commutative ring. Therefore, the assumption would be \"a, b, c are elements of a commutative ring.\" But the problem doesn't state this, so perhaps the answer should list that as an assumption. Alternatively, the problem might consider a, b, c as real numbers, which is a common context unless specified otherwise. However, the example given by the user includes an assumption that n is an integer, so following that, maybe here we can list \"a, b, c are real numbers\" as the assumption. But the problem doesn't specify, so this is an assumption. Alternatively, since the problem is about abstract algebra, the assumption might be that a, b, c are elements of a ring. But the user's example included specific conditions even if they were part of the problem statement. Given the confusion in the example, perhaps the correct approach is to list the variables as elements of a commutative ring, allowing the algebraic manipulations. Therefore, the assumptions would be: \"a, b, c are elements of a commutative ring.\" But since the user's example split each assumption into separate lines, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object, here, since all three variables are under the same condition, maybe it's one line: \"a, b, c are elements of a commutative ring.\" Alternatively, if we need to list each variable separately, but that's not necessary. The example had two separate lines for n: \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", which are two different conditions. In this case, the only condition is the structure where a, b, c live. Therefore, the assumption line is: \"a, b, c are elements of a commutative ring.\" But the problem didn't state this, so it's an implicit assumption. Alternatively, if we consider that in basic algebra, variables are assumed to be in a field like real numbers, then the assumption could be \"a, b, c are real numbers.\" However, the user's example didn't state that n is a real number; instead, it was an integer. Therefore, perhaps the assumption here is that a, b, c are elements of a commutative ring (which includes integers, real numbers, complex numbers, etc.), making the identity hold universally. Therefore, the formatted problem would have the assumption: \"a, b, c are elements of a commutative ring.\" and the problem statement as given. So putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\na, b, c are elements of a commutative ring.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$(a-b)^3 + (b-c)^3 + (c-a)^3 -3(a-b)(b-c)(c-a) = 0$$ without calculations, using abstract algebra.\n\nBut wait, the original question mentions using abstract algebra in a simpler way without calculations, so maybe another assumption is that the ring is commutative, which allows the use of properties like symmetry or polynomial identities. Therefore, the assumption is necessary to state that the elements are in a commutative ring. That seems reasonable. Thus, the formatted problem should list that assumption.",
