    "Content": "Edit : So I have verified that my argument was correct, but I have just arrived to a different result. How do I give direct a combinatorial proof for this identity?\nI want to prove combinatorially , $$\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{k}{n^k} \\binom{n+1}{k+1}=n$$ My Attempt (didn't work) : Let's count the number of sequences of length $n+1$ : $(x_1,\\ldots,x_{n+1})$ from a set of $n$ elements. For every $x_i$ , there are $n$ choices, so it is just simply $n^{n+1}$ We can also let $x_{k+1}$ be the first repeated element in our sequence. The first $k$ elements of the sequence can be chosen in $k!\\binom{n}{k}$ ways (all distinct), and $x_{k+1}$ can be chosen in $k$ ways (choosing which of the first $k$ elements is repeated). The elements at the remaining $n-k$ positions can then be chosen in $n^{n-k}$ ways (no restriction at all). Multiplying these together and summing over $k$ , we get $$n^{n+1}=\\sum_{k=0}^nk!\\binom{n}{k}\\cdot k\\cdot n^{n-k} \\tag1$$ Using $\\binom{n}{k}=\\frac{k+1}{n+1} \\binom{n+1}{k+1}$ , $$n^{n+1}=\\sum_{k=0}^{n} k!\\cdot\\frac{k+1}{n+1} \\binom{n+1}{k+1}\\cdot k\\cdot\\frac{n^n}{n^k} \\tag2$$ $$n=\\sum_{k=0}^{n} k!\\cdot \\frac{k+1}{n+1} \\binom{n+1}{k+1} \\cdot \\frac{k}{n^k} \\tag3$$ $$n=\\sum_{k=1}^{n}\\frac{(k+1)!}{n+1} \\binom{n+1}{k+1} \\cdot \\frac{k}{n^k} \\tag4$$ So clearly I didn’t get the desired result (But it is infact correct).How do I give a direct combinatorial proof for the original identity?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here's another solution, closer to what you were trying. We'll first prove $$(n+1)^{n+1}=\\sum_{k=0}^n(k+1)\\binom{n+1}{k+1}n^{n-k}$$ and from this we'll get the desired result. The combinatorial part will be proving the above identity, and transforming into what you want will be algebraic manipulation. Consider sequences $(x_1,\\cdots,x_{n+1})$ such that exactly one of the $x_i$ 's equals $0$ and all the other $x_i$ 's are in $\\{1,\\cdots,n+1\\}$ . We have $n+1$ ways to choose where to place the $0$ and then all the other positions have $n+1$ options, so we have $$(n+1)\\cdot(n+1)^{n}=(n+1)^{n+1}$$ such sequences. On the other hand, we can count the number of $x_i$ 's that equal $1$ . We'll count how many sequences have $k\\in\\{0,\\cdots,n\\}$ ones. We can choose out of the $n+1$ positions, $k+1$ of them, and out of them choose one to be the $0$ and all the other ones to be $1$ . Then, out of the $n-k$ remaining positions, we can choose any number for each one out of $\\{2,\\cdots,n+1\\}$ . So that gives us $\\binom{n+1}{k+1}(k+1)n^{n-k}$ such ways. This proves the identity. Now, notice that \\begin{align}(n+1)^{n+1}&=\\sum_{k=0}^n(k+1)\\binom{n+1}{k+1}n^{n-k}\\\\\\\\&=\\sum_{k=0}^nk\\binom{n+1}{k+1}n^{n-k}+\\sum_{k=0}^n\\binom{n+1}{k+1}n^{n-k}\\\\\\\\&=\\sum_{k=1}^nk\\binom{n+1}{k+1}n^{n-k}+\\sum_{k=1}^{n+1}\\binom{n+1}{k}n^{n+1-k}\\\\\\\\&=\\sum_{k=1}^nk\\binom{n+1}{k+1}n^{n-k}+(n+1)^{n+1}-n^{n+1}\\\\\\\\n^{n+1}&=\\sum_{k=1}^nk\\binom{n+1}{k+1}n^{n-k}\\end{align} as we wanted. Notice that this arrives at the same identity as the other comment by other means, although I hadn't seen the other solution, so this shows that you can also arrived via this approach more similar to what you were thinking",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a math professor who can read a Math Stack Exchange question, filter out the unrelated info, and structure it into the specified format with Assumptions and Problem. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the example provided. The original problem was about proving that A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted version listed assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Then the problem was restated. \n\nNow, looking at the current problem from Math Stack Exchange. The title is about making a combinatorial proof for an identity involving a sum with binomial coefficients. The user tried an approach but ended up with a different result and is asking for a direct combinatorial proof. \n\nSo, the task is to extract the assumptions and the problem. The assumptions here would be the conditions given in the problem. The problem is the identity that needs to be proven combinatorially.\n\nLooking at the identity: ∑_{k=1}^n [k/(n^k) * C(n+1, k+1)] = n. \n\nThe user mentions that their attempt involved counting sequences of length n+1 from a set of n elements. However, their approach didn't lead to the desired identity. They transformed the equation but ended up with a different expression. Now, they need a direct combinatorial proof.\n\nBut for the assumptions, in combinatorial proofs, usually, the assumptions are about the objects being counted. Here, the problem is purely combinatorial, so the main assumption would be that n is a positive integer, as the sum is from k=1 to n, and binomial coefficients require integer parameters. \n\nWait, the problem doesn't specify any restrictions on n beyond being a positive integer, since otherwise the binomial coefficients and the sum wouldn't make sense. So the key assumption here is that n is a positive integer. \n\nThe problem is to prove the given sum equals n using a combinatorial argument. The original attempt used sequences but led to a different expression, so the user wants a correct combinatorial approach.\n\nSo, structuring this:\n\nAssumption: n is a positive integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that ∑_{k=1}^{n} [k/(n^k) * binomial(n+1, k+1)] = n using a direct combinatorial proof.\n\nBut wait, the original problem's title says \"How do I make a simple combinatorial proof...\", so the problem is asking for a combinatorial proof of that identity. The user attempted a proof involving sequences but arrived at a different equation. The core problem is the identity given. So, the assumptions would be that n is a positive integer. There are no other explicit conditions mentioned, like divisibility or specific ranges beyond k going from 1 to n. So the main assumption is n is a positive integer. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list that assumption and then present the problem as proving the identity via combinatorial methods.",
