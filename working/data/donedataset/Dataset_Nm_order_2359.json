    "Content": "Consider the following integral: $$\nI(n) = \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi}\\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi}e^{ i n (x+y)}\\,\\frac{2\\sin^2(x)\\sin^2(y)}{2k -\\cos(x)-\\cos( y)}\\,\\mathrm{d}x\\,\\mathrm{d}y,\n$$ where $k>1$ is a real number and $n>0$ is an integer number. My question. Is it possible to characterize the asymptotic behavior of $I(n)$ as a function of $n$ ? Numerics suggests that $I(n)\\sim \\frac{1}{\\sqrt n}\\left(k-\\sqrt{k^2-1}\\right)^{2n}$ , however I have not yet been able to formally prove this fact. This is not an homework question. Any help is welcome! Thanks in advance! Progress. I briefly sketch my attempt to solve the problem, hoping that someone may find this useful. Note that $g(x,y)$ is analytic in a neighborhood of $\\mathbb{R}^2/\\mathbb{Z}$ . Thus, we can shift the integral in the complex direction $it$ as long as $g$ remains analytic. This is indeed the case for all $$\nt < t_0 :=  \\cosh^{-1} k\n    =  \\ln  \\left(k + \\sqrt{k^2-1}\\right)= -\\frac1{2\\pi} \\ln  \\left(k - \\sqrt{k^2-1}\\right).\n$$ Thus, by letting $t=t_0$ , we get \\begin{align*}\nI(n) &= e^{-2 n t_0}\\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi}\\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi}e^{ in(x+y)}\\,g(x+it_0,y+it_0)\\,\\mathrm{d}x\\,\\mathrm{d}y\\\\\n&= \\left(k-\\sqrt{k^2-1}\\right)^{2n} I'(n),\n\\end{align*} where \\begin{align*}\nI'(n) &= \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi}\\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi}e^{ in(x+y)}\\,g(x+it_0,y+it_0)\\,\\mathrm{d}x\\,\\mathrm{d}y\\\\ &=\\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi}\\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi}\\frac{e^{i n (x+y)}}{K}\\frac{(K^2(2-K^2e^{-2i x})-e^{-2ix})(K^2(2-K^2e^{-2i y})-e^{-2 iy}) }{K(4k-K(e^{- i x}+e^{- i y}))-e^{ i x}-e^{ i y}}\\,\\mathrm{d}x\\,\\mathrm{d}y\\\\\n\\end{align*} where $K:=k+\\sqrt{k^2-1}$ . Although the integrand of $I'(n)$ blows up at $x=0$ , $y=0$ , $I'(n)$ still converges absolutely, and I think it should be possible to prove that $I'(n)$ exhibits subexponential decay. As a further observation, note that by using the change of variables $z=e^{i x}$ , $t=e^{iy}$ , $I'(n)$ can be rewritten as $$\nI'(n):=\\oint_{|z|=1} \\oint_{|t|=1} \\frac{z^{n-2}t^{n-2}\\left(2K^2z^2-K^4-z^4\\right)\\left(2K^2t^2-K^4-t^4\\right)}{K\\left(4kzt-K(z+t)\\right)-(z+t)zt}\\,\\mathrm{d}z\\,\\mathrm{d}t.\n$$ Perhaps, this integral could be handled more easily using contour integration techniques; however it looks like pretty messy. I'm currently stuck here.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse through this problem. The user has an integral I(n) that they want to characterize the asymptotic behavior of, specifically as a function of n. The integral is a double integral over x and y from -π to π, involving an exponential term and a denominator with 2k minus cosines. They mention that numerically it seems to behave like (k - sqrt(k² -1))^{2n} divided by sqrt(n), and they want to prove this formally.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. Let's look at the original problem statement. The integral I(n) is defined with k > 1, which is a real number, and n > 0 is an integer. So those are two assumptions right there. Then, in their progress, they mention shifting the integral in the complex direction, which requires analyticity of the integrand. They specify t_0 as cosh^{-1}(k), which relates to the condition for keeping the integrand analytic. But I think the main assumptions are about k and n. Let me check again.\n\nThe problem statement says k > 1, real number; n > 0 is an integer. The rest seems to be part of their attempt. So the assumptions are:\n\n- k is a real number greater than 1.\n- n is a positive integer.\n\nThe problem is to characterize the asymptotic behavior of I(n) as n becomes large. They suggest a specific asymptotic form and want to confirm it.\n\nSo when structuring this into the required format, the assumptions would be each on a separate line, addressing one property per line. Then the problem statement is about finding the asymptotic behavior.\n\nI need to make sure there's no extra information. The original problem mentions \"k > 1\", \"n > 0 is an integer\", and the rest is their progress. So yes, the assumptions are those two. The problem is their question about asymptotic behavior. The user's proposed asymptotic is given, but in the problem statement, it's just to characterize the asymptotic behavior, not necessarily to verify their guess. Although they do mention the numerics suggest that form. But according to the example given, the problem part is the user's original question, so probably it's okay to include the proposed asymptotic as part of the problem statement, but maybe just state that the task is to prove or characterize the asymptotic behavior as a function of n, possibly confirming the suggested form.\n\nWait, the example had the problem part as \"Prove that... is divisible by 91.\" So here, the problem should be \"Characterize the asymptotic behavior of I(n) as a function of n,\" perhaps including the conjectured form. However, the user's exact question is \"Is it possible to characterize the asymptotic behavior of I(n) as a function of n ? Numerics suggests that I(n)∼ ...\"\n\nBut according to the example, the problem part is the actual problem statement. So maybe in this case, the problem is to prove that I(n) is asymptotically ∼ [their expression]. But the user is asking if it's possible to characterize, and mentions the numerical suggestion. However, the original problem in the example had an incorrect assumption (n divisible by 7), which was in the formatted problem. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. Then the formatted problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was not in the original problem. Wait, that example seems to have a mistake. Wait, the user provided an example where the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. So maybe the example was wrong? Wait, perhaps that's part of the process where the user is supposed to filter unrelated information and list assumptions. Wait, perhaps in the original problem, there was a hidden assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the user didn't state it. That example might be confusing. Anyway, perhaps the key here is that in the current problem, the assumptions are k > 1 (real), n is a positive integer. The problem is to find the asymptotic behavior of I(n) as a function of n. The user's conjecture is part of the problem statement. So in the problem part, we can include the conjecture as part of the problem to prove. So the problem would be: \"Prove that I(n) ∼ (1/√n)(k - sqrt(k² -1))^{2n} as n approaches infinity.\"\n\nAlternatively, since the user is asking to characterize the asymptotic behavior, and they suggest that form, perhaps the problem is to determine the asymptotic behavior and confirm the conjecture. So the formatted problem would be: \"Characterize the asymptotic behavior of I(n) as a function of n. Numerics suggests that I(n) ∼ (1/√n)(k - sqrt(k² -1))^{2n}; prove this conjecture.\"\n\nBut according to the example, the problem part is just the problem as stated, without necessarily including the user's progress. The example had the original problem's assumptions filtered and the problem restated. So maybe here, the assumptions are k >1 (real), n is a positive integer, and the problem is \"Characterize the asymptotic behavior of I(n) as a function of n.\" However, the user also mentions the numeric suggestion, so perhaps including that in the problem statement would be helpful. Let me check the example again. The example's original problem had \"Prove that for every integer n...\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the example is not from the user but from the assistant? Wait, the original problem in the example says \"Prove that for every integer n...\" but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That might be a mistake in the example. Therefore, perhaps the example is incorrect, but following the instruction, the task is to list all assumptions from the problem. In the current problem, the user states that k >1 and n is a positive integer. Therefore, those are the assumptions. The problem is to characterize the asymptotic behavior, with the note that numerics suggest a certain form, but the core problem is to characterize it. Therefore, the formatted problem would list the assumptions as k >1 and n is a positive integer, and the problem is to characterize the asymptotic behavior of I(n) as a function of n. But since the user mentions the specific conjectured form, perhaps it's better to include that in the problem statement. The problem is to prove the asymptotic equivalence suggested by numerics. Therefore, the problem statement would be: \"Prove that I(n) ∼ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\left(k - \\sqrt{k^2 -1}\\right)^{2n} as n approaches infinity.\"\n\nBut the original problem's question is \"Is it possible to characterize the asymptotic behavior of I(n) as a function of n?\" So maybe the problem should be phrased as \"Characterize the asymptotic behavior of I(n) as a function of n, and prove that I(n) ∼ ...\"\n\nBut following the example's format, the problem part is just the problem. So in the example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem lists assumptions (n is integer, n divisible by 7) and problem is \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" Wait, but in the original problem, the user didn't assume n divisible by 7. So the example might have added an assumption that wasn't present. Therefore, perhaps in this case, the assistant needs to filter any unrelated information but list the actual assumptions given in the problem. So in this problem, the user says \"k>1 is a real number and n>0 is an integer number.\" So the assumptions are k>1 and n is a positive integer. The problem is to characterize the asymptotic behavior of I(n) as a function of n. But since the user suggests a specific asymptotic, perhaps the problem is to prove that asymptotic. Therefore, the problem statement should be: \"Prove that I(n) ∼ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\left( k - \\sqrt{k^2 -1} \\right)^{2n} as n approaches infinity.\"\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nk is a real number greater than 1,\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$I(n) \\sim \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\left( k - \\sqrt{k^2 -1} \\right)^{2n}$$ as \\( n \\) approaches infinity.\n\nBut wait, in the user's question, they say \"characterize the asymptotic behavior\", but they also mention the numeric suggestion. So maybe the problem is to determine the asymptotic behavior, possibly confirming the conjecture. Therefore, the problem could be phrased as: \"Characterize the asymptotic behavior of \\( I(n) \\) as a function of \\( n \\). Numerics suggest that \\( I(n) \\sim \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\left( k - \\sqrt{k^2 -1} \\right)^{2n} \\); prove this conjecture.\"\n\nBut according to the example, the problem part is just the problem statement, so perhaps the problem is \"Characterize the asymptotic behavior of I(n) as a function of n.\" But given that the user has a conjecture, maybe including that in the problem statement would be useful. However, the example didn't include the numeric suggestion in the problem statement. The example had the original problem as proving divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem was the same but with an added assumption. But in this case, perhaps the correct approach is to list the assumptions given in the problem (k>1, n>0 integer) and the problem is to characterize the asymptotic behavior, with the note of the conjecture. However, since the user's original question is \"Is it possible to characterize...?\" which is a yes/no question, but they also state the numeric suggestion. To follow the example, the problem should be rephrased as a statement to prove. Therefore, perhaps the problem is to prove the asymptotic equivalence as conjectured. Hence:\n\nAssumption:\nk is a real number greater than 1,\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$I(n) \\sim \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\left( k - \\sqrt{k^2 -1} \\right)^{2n}$$ as \\( n \\to \\infty \\).\n\nBut need to check if the user's exact problem includes the conjecture as part of the problem. Since the user is asking to characterize the asymptotic behavior, and they mention the numeric suggestion, perhaps the problem is to determine the asymptotic behavior and confirm the conjecture. So the problem would be as above.\n\nI think that's the correct approach.
