    "AcceptedAnswer": "The statement is not true. To make the counterexample simpler, I will take $f:[-1,1]^2 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$.  Let f(x,y)=xy .  So we have ---0+++\n---0+++\n0000000\n+++0---\n+++0--- Consider the image of xy=0 in g(x)+h(y) .  Since it's a connected, compact set, the image is connected and compact, so an interval [m,n], with $\\Phi([m,n])=0$.  We may assume that $\\Phi(n+\\epsilon)>0$ and $\\Phi(m-\\epsilon)<0$.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about whether a continuous function f(x,y) on [0,1]^2 can be written as Φ(g(x) + h(y)) where g, h, and Φ are continuous functions. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. Let's see:\n\n1. The domain of f is [0,1]^2. So the first assumption is that f is defined on the square [0,1]x[0,1].\n2. The function f is continuous. So the second assumption is about the continuity of f.\n3. The functions g and h are from [0,1] to R, and they need to be continuous. So third and fourth assumptions would be the continuity of g and h.\n4. Phi is a function from R to R, also continuous. So fifth assumption is the continuity of Phi.\n5. The problem is to prove or disprove if such a representation exists for any continuous f. \n\nWait, the problem says \"Let f be a continuous function. Then there exist continuous functions g, h, and Phi such that...\" So the main assumptions are on f, g, h, Phi. The user also mentions that this is a weaker version than the MO question because here g and h can depend on f, which the MO version might not allow. But in this problem, the existence is such that for each f, there exist g, h, Phi (dependent on f) to represent it.\n\nSo the assumptions should list the properties of each object involved:\n\n- f is a function from [0,1]^2 to R.\n- f is continuous.\n- g is a function from [0,1] to R.\n- g is continuous.\n- h is a function from [0,1] to R.\n- h is continuous.\n- Phi is a function from R to R.\n- Phi is continuous.\n\nThe problem is to prove or disprove that f(x,y) = Phi(g(x) + h(y)).\n\nWait, but in the original problem statement, the user is asking whether for every continuous f, such g, h, Phi exist. So the problem is a statement: For every continuous f on [0,1]^2, there exist continuous g, h: [0,1]->R and continuous Phi: R->R such that f(x,y) = Phi(g(x) + h(y)).\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n- f: [0,1]^2 → ℝ is continuous.\n- g: [0,1] → ℝ is continuous.\n- h: [0,1] → ℝ is continuous.\n- Φ: ℝ → ℝ is continuous.\n\nAnd the problem is to prove or disprove that f(x,y) can be expressed as Φ(g(x) + h(y)).\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is one line, one property per line, applied to one object.\n\nSo for the Assumption part:\n\nAssumption:\n$f\\colon[0,1]^2\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function,\n$g\\colon[0,1]\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function,\n$h\\colon[0,1]\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function,\n$\\Phi\\colon\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function.\n\nBut wait, the problem is stating that given f, do such g, h, Phi exist. So the assumptions for the problem are that f is continuous, and then the question is about the existence of g, h, Phi (which are to be found) with their continuity. So in the Assumption section, we list all given conditions. The given conditions here are that f is continuous on [0,1]^2. The existence of g, h, Phi with their continuity is part of the problem's conclusion, not the assumptions. Therefore, the assumption should only include the conditions that are given, not the ones that need to be proven.\n\nWait, the problem says \"Let f be a continuous function. Then there exist continuous functions g, h, Phi such that...\" So the given assumption is f is continuous. The other functions g, h, Phi are part of what needs to be proven to exist. Therefore, the assumptions here are only about f. The other functions' continuity is part of the conclusion. Wait, no. The problem is to determine if for any continuous f, there exists such g, h, Phi (with continuity). So the assumptions are:\n\n- f is defined on [0,1]^2.\n- f is continuous.\n\nThen the problem is to prove or disprove the existence of g, h, Phi (each continuous) such that f(x,y) = Phi(g(x) + h(y)).\n\nTherefore, the Assumptions section should list the given conditions on f, not on g, h, Phi. Because the existence of g, h, Phi is what's being questioned.\n\nSo in the example provided earlier, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer, and that n is divisible by 7. Those were the given conditions.\n\nIn this case, the given conditions are:\n\n- f: [0,1]^2 → ℝ is continuous.\n\nThe rest (g, h, Phi being continuous) are part of the conclusion. Therefore, the Assumption section should only include the properties of f. Wait, but in the problem statement, the user wrote: \"Let f: [0,1]^2 → ℝ be a continuous function. Then there are continuous functions g, h: [0,1]→ℝ and Φ: ℝ→ℝ such that...\" So the assumptions are that f is continuous. The conclusion is the existence of g, h, Phi with continuity. Therefore, the Assumption section here should list the given conditions on f. So:\n\nAssumption:\n$f\\colon[0,1]^2\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that there exist continuous functions $g,\\ h\\colon [0,1]\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ and $\\Phi\\colon \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x,y) = \\Phi(g(x) + h(y))$.\n\nWait, but in the example given, the original problem had the user adding the divisibility by 7 as an assumption, but in the original problem statement, the user had written \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like an error. Wait, the original problem was: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem's assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that would mean the problem in the example was modified to have an extra assumption? That seems like a mistake. Maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is that n is an integer, and the problem is to show divisibility by 91. But in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\", which is not in the original. That seems incorrect.\n\nTherefore, maybe the user's example is incorrect. But according to the user's instruction, the task is to structure the problem as in the example, which included listing assumptions, even if the original problem didn't state them. Wait, the example given by the user has:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut this seems incorrect because the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake here, but the instruction is to follow their format. However, in the current problem, the user's original problem states:\n\n\"Let f: [0,1]^2→ℝ be a continuous function. Then there are continuous functions g, h: [0,1]→ℝ and Φ: ℝ→ℝ such that f(x,y) = Φ(g(x) + h(y)).\"\n\nTherefore, in this case, the assumptions are:\n\n- f is a function from [0,1]^2 to ℝ.\n- f is continuous.\n\nThe problem is to prove or disprove the existence of continuous g, h, Φ such that f(x,y) = Φ(g(x) + h(y)).\n\nTherefore, following the user's example (even if it's incorrect), but perhaps the user intended that in the assumption section, all the conditions given in the problem should be listed. So if the original problem says \"Let f be a continuous function\", then the assumption is that f is continuous. The other functions' continuity is part of the conclusion (i.e., they must exist with continuity). Therefore, in the assumption section, we only list what's given, not what's to be proven.\n\nTherefore, the correct Assumption here is:\n\nAssumption:\n$f\\colon[0,1]^2\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function.\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that there exist continuous functions $g,\\ h\\colon [0,1]\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ and $\\Phi\\colon \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x,y) = \\Phi(g(x) + h(y))$.\n\nWait, but in the user's example, they added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (n divisible by 7). That suggests that perhaps the user wants to list all assumptions, even implicit ones, but in the original problem here, the assumptions are explicit: f is continuous. So the answer should list that.\n\nBut maybe the user's example was a mistake, and the correct approach is to list all given assumptions, not adding new ones. So in the current problem, the original assumption is only that f is continuous on [0,1]^2. The rest (existence of g, h, Phi with continuity) is what needs to be proven. Therefore, the correct formatting is:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$f\\colon[0,1]^2\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function.\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that there exist continuous functions $g,\\ h\\colon [0,1]\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ and $\\Phi\\colon \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x,y) = \\Phi(g(x) + h(y))$.\n###",
