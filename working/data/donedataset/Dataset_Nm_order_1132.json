    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's being asked. The user wants me to structure the given integral identity into the specified format, listing assumptions and then the problem.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are specific conditions applied to each object. In the original problem here, the integral is from 0 to infinity, and there's a condition a > 0. The integrand involves functions like sin x, cosh ax, cos x, and a fraction with x over (x² - π²). The result is an expression involving arctangent and 1/a.\n\nSo the main assumptions here would be the limits of integration (from 0 to infinity), the variable a being greater than 0, and perhaps the form of the integrand. But wait, the example listed assumptions about the variable's properties. The original problem states \"a > 0\" explicitly, which is a direct assumption on the parameter a. The integral is definite from 0 to ∞, which is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. The integrand's structure is part of the problem to be proven, so that's included in the problem section.\n\nTherefore, the only explicit assumption here is that a is greater than 0. The integral's limits and the form of the integrand are part of the problem statement. So in the Assumption section, it's just \"a > 0\". Then the problem is to prove the given integral equals arctan(1/a) - 1/a.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the integral's variable is x, but the parameter a is given to be positive. So the main assumption is a > 0. The problem is to prove the integral identity. So the formatted problem should have assumption: a > 0, and the problem is the integral equals that expression.\n\nI think that's it. Let me check again. The user's example extracted assumptions from the original problem. In the integral case, the only condition given is a > 0. So that's the key assumption. The rest is part of the problem statement. Therefore, the formatted answer should be:\n\nAssumption:\na > 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that\n$$\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cosh ax+\\cos x}\\frac{x}{x^2-\\pi^2}dx=\\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{a}\\right)-\\frac{1}{a}.$$\n\nYes, that seems correct. The problem includes the integral expression, and the assumption is just the condition on a. No other hidden assumptions here. The integral is over x from 0 to infinity, but that's part of the problem's setup, not an assumption on variables. So this should be the correct formatting.",
