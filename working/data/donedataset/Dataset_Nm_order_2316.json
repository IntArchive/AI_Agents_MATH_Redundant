    "Content": "Prompted by this question , I tried to show that $(2,5)$ is the only solution in positive integers of $x^y - y^x = x+y$ (which would show, a fortiori , that it's the only solution in primes). It's convenient to rewrite the equation as $f(x,y) = x^y - y^x - x - y = 0$. With the aid of some trial calculations, I reasoned informally as follows: If $x=1$ then $f(x,y) = -2y=0$, implying $y=0$. If $x=2$ and $y \\leq 5$, then a case-by-case check shows that only $(2,5)$ is a solution. If $(x,y) = (2,6)$ then $f(x,y) = 20$, and as $y$ increases above $6$, $f(x,y)$ increases. If $x \\geq 3$ and $y \\leq x$ then $f(x,y) < 0$. If $x \\geq 3$ and $y=x+1$, then $f(x,y)>0$, and as $y$ increases above $x+1$, $f(x,y)$ increases. How can the above be made into a rigorous proof?  I've included calculus as a tag since it could be useful in showing under what conditions $f(x,y)$ is an increasing function of $y$ (viewing it as a real variable).",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If $(x,y) = (2,6)$ then $f(x,y) = 20$, and as $y$ increases above $6$, $f(x,y)$ increases. To prove this rigorously, let us prove by induction that $$2^{X-1}\\gt X+1\\tag1$$ for $X\\ge 6$. The base case : $2^{6-1}=32\\gt 7=6+1$. Supposing that $(1)$ holds for some $X$ gives\n$$2^{(X+1)-1}=2\\cdot 2^{X-1}\\gt 2(X+1)=X+X+2\\gt (X+1)+1\\quad\\blacksquare$$ Using $(1)$, we get, for $y\\ge 6$,\n$$f(2,y+1)-f(2,y)=2(2^{y-1}-y-1)\\gt 0$$ If $x \\geq 3$ and $y \\leq x$ then $f(x,y) < 0$. $f(x,1)=-2\\lt 0$. To prove that $f(x,2)\\lt 0$ for $x\\ge 3$, let us prove by induction that $$2^X\\gt X^2-X-2\\tag2$$ for $X\\ge 4$. The base case : $2^4=16\\gt 10=4^2-4-2$. Supposing that $(2)$ holds for some $X$ gives $$\\begin{align}2^{X+1}&=2\\cdot 2^X\\\\&\\gt 2(X^2-X-2)\\\\&=(X+1)^2-(X+1)-2+X(X-3)-2\\\\&\\ge (X+1)^2-(X+1)-2+4(4-3)-2\\\\&\\gt (X+1)^2-(X+1)-2\\quad\\blacksquare\\end{align}$$ Also, it is easy to see that $(2)$ holds for $X=3$. Using this, we get, for $x\\ge 3$, $$f(x,2)=(x^2-x-2)-2^x\\lt 0$$ To prove that $f(x,y)\\lt 0$ for $3\\le y\\le x$, we use the fact that $y=\\frac{\\ln x}{x}$ is decreasing for $x\\gt e$. We see that $\\frac{\\ln y}{y}\\ge \\frac{\\ln x}{x}$ for $3\\le y\\le x$ from which $x^y-y^x\\le 0$ follows. It follows from this that we have, for $3\\le y\\le x$, $$f(x,y)=x^y-y^x-x-y\\le 0-x-y\\lt 0$$ If $x \\geq 3$ and $y=x+1$, then $f(x,y)>0$, and as $y$ increases above $x+1$, $f(x,y)$ increases. This answer proves that $f(x,y)\\gt 0$ for $x\\ge 3$ and $y\\ge x+2$. Let $y=x+a$ where $a\\ge 2$ is an integer. Then, $$\\frac{f(x,x+a)}{x^x}=x^{a}-\\left(1+\\frac ax\\right)^x-\\frac{2}{x^{x-1}}-\\frac{a}{x^x}\\gt x^a-e^a-\\frac 29-\\frac{a}{x^x}:=g(x)$$ Since $g'(x)=ax^{a-1}+\\frac{a+a\\ln x}{x^x}\\gt 0$, $g(x)$ is increasing with $g(3)=3^a-e^a-\\frac 29-\\frac{a}{27}:=h(a)$. We have $h'(a)=3^a\\ln 3-e^a-\\frac{1}{27}$ and $h''(a)=3^a(\\ln 3)^2-e^a\\gt 0$ with $h'(2)=9\\ln 3-e^2-\\frac{1}{27}\\gt 0$ and $h(2)=9-e^2-\\frac 29-\\frac{2}{27}\\gt 0$. So, $h(a)\\gt 0$ for $a\\ge 2$. It follows from this that $g(x)\\gt 0$ for $x\\ge 3$. Therefore, $f(x,x+a)\\gt 0$ follows.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. First, I need to identify all the assumptions and then restate the problem clearly.\n\nLooking at the original problem: The equation is x^y - y^x = x + y, and they want to prove that (2,5) is the only solution in positive integers. The original question mentions several cases: x=1, x=2 with y≤5, x=2 with y≥6, x≥3 with y≤x, and x≥3 with y=x+1 or greater. \n\nThe user's example shows that each assumption should list one property applied to one object. So I need to parse through the question and extract each condition. For example, when x=1, that's one assumption. Then for x=2 and y≤5, another. Similarly, x≥3 and y≤x, etc. Each of these is a separate condition that the problem considers.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking to prove that (2,5) is the only solution. The assumptions here are the different cases the original poster considered in their informal reasoning. So each of those scenarios (like x=1, x=2 with y≤5, etc.) are the assumptions they made. But in the example provided by the user, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. However, in this current problem, the assumptions might be the different cases that need to be considered to cover all possibilities. But wait, the problem itself is to show that (2,5) is the only solution. So the problem's assumptions are the conditions given in the problem, which is that x and y are positive integers. But in the original problem statement, the user already considered various cases. So perhaps the assumptions here are the constraints on x and y that the problem is considering. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem had A(n) defined, and the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But in the problem as given, the user might have missed that n needs to be divisible by 7, but in the original problem, maybe the user intended that for all integers n, but in the formatted version, the assumptions were listed as n being an integer and divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the question says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted version added the assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, the original problem in the example was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted problem lists the assumption as n being an integer and divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect? Because if the original problem is for every integer n, then the assumption should be n is an integer, but the user added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which might not be part of the original problem. But perhaps the example is illustrative of how to structure, even if the original problem's assumptions are different. Wait, maybe the user made a typo or error in the example. But regardless, the current task is to structure the given problem according to the format.\n\nBack to the current problem. The problem is to prove that x^y - y^x = x + y has only one solution in positive integers, which is (2,5). The assumptions here would be the conditions on x and y. The original question mentions positive integers, so the assumptions would include that x and y are positive integers. However, in their informal reasoning, they split into cases like x=1, x=2, y≤5, etc. But those are part of their approach, not the problem's assumptions. So the main assumptions for the problem are:\n\n- x is a positive integer\n\n- y is a positive integer\n\nBut maybe also considering symmetry? Wait, the problem doesn't assume x < y or anything like that. So perhaps the only assumptions are that x and y are positive integers. However, in the original problem, the user is trying to prove that (2,5) is the only solution. So the problem's assumptions are that x and y are positive integers, and the problem is to show that the only solution is (2,5). Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumptions should list all the given conditions. So:\n\nAssumption: x is a positive integer,\n\nAssumption: y is a positive integer,\n\nProblem: Prove that the equation x^y - y^x = x + y has only one solution (2,5).\n\nBut wait, in the example provided by the user, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n divisible by 7, but the original problem statement was \"for every integer n\". So maybe there's a discrepancy. Wait, perhaps the user's example is incorrect. For instance, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem includes \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That would mean the problem is actually to prove that for integers n divisible by 7, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So perhaps there was a mistake in the example. But regardless, for the current problem, the user's instruction is to filter unrelated information and structure the problem with assumptions line by line.\n\nLooking back at the current problem: The user mentions the equation x^y - y^x = x + y and wants to prove that (2,5) is the only solution in positive integers. The original question's problem statement includes various cases like x=1, x=2, etc., but these are part of the user's reasoning, not assumptions of the problem. The actual assumptions are that x and y are positive integers.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption: x is a positive integer,\n\nAssumption: y is a positive integer,\n\nProblem: Prove that x^y - y^x = x + y has only one solution (2,5).\n\nBut wait, the original problem also mentions \"in positive integers\", so the assumptions are x and y being positive integers. However, maybe there are more detailed assumptions, like x and y being primes, but the original problem says \"in positive integers (which would show, a fortiori, that it's the only solution in primes)\". So the main problem is about positive integers, and the primes part is a corollary. Therefore, the problem's main assumptions are x and y are positive integers.\n\nBut the user in their question says \"How can the above be made into a rigorous proof?\" referring to their case analysis. So maybe the problem requires considering those cases as part of the assumptions? For example, x=1, x=2, etc. But no, those are part of the proof steps, not the problem's initial conditions. The problem's assumptions are just that x and y are positive integers. The rest of the cases are part of the proof strategy.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list the basic assumptions that x and y are positive integers, and the problem is to show that only (2,5) satisfies the equation.\n\nBut let me check the example again. The example had the original problem saying \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That suggests that sometimes the formatted problem includes more specific assumptions than the original problem. Wait, that would be incorrect unless the original problem had a typo. Maybe the example is a bad example, but following the user's instruction, we need to follow the format.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to extract all implicit assumptions from the problem. For example, in the original problem's example, maybe the problem actually requires n to be divisible by 7 to have A(n) divisible by 91, but the original problem statement said \"for every integer n\", which is incorrect, and the formatted problem corrected that. But that's speculative.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question is to prove that (2,5) is the only solution in positive integers. The problem's assumptions are x and y are positive integers. However, the user's own reasoning in the question mentions several cases: x=1, x=2, y≤5, etc. But those are part of their approach, not the problem's assumptions. So the formatted problem's assumptions should only include the conditions given in the problem statement, not the proof steps.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatting is:\n\nAssumption: x is a positive integer,\n\nAssumption: y is a positive integer,\n\nProblem: Prove that the equation x^y - y^x = x + y has only one solution (2,5).\n\nBut wait, the original problem title is \"How to prove that x^y - y^x = x + y has only one solution in positive integers?\" So the problem is to prove that there's only one solution, given x and y are positive integers. So the assumptions are x and y are positive integers, and the problem is to prove uniqueness of (2,5).\n\nYes, that's correct. Therefore, the formatted problem should list x and y as positive integers, and the problem is to show the equation has only that solution.",
