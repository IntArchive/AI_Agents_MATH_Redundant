    "AcceptedAnswer": "Denote $\\frac{(2m)!(2n)!}{m!n!(m + n)!}$ by $S(n,m)$. It satisfies relation $S(n+1,m)+S(n,m+1)=4S(n,m)$ (cf. Pascal's triangle) — or, equivalently, $S(n+1,m)=4S(n,m)-S(n,m+1)$. Since $S(0,m)=\\binom{2m}m$ is an integer, this relation implies that all $S(n,m)$ are integers. Ref.: I. Gessel.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants me to prove that the expression (2m)!(2n)! / [m!n!(m + n)!] is an integer for all non-negative integers m and n. Hmm, factorials often involve combinatorial interpretations or divisibility properties. Maybe I should start by recalling some known formulas or theorems related to factorials and integers.\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure of the expression. The numerator is the product of (2m)! and (2n)!, and the denominator is m! times n! times (m + n)!. So we need to show that the denominator divides the numerator. That is, the numerator has all the prime factors of the denominator with sufficient exponents.\n\nOne approach could be to use Legendre's formula, which gives the exponent of a prime p in the factorial of a number. Maybe if I can show that for every prime p, the exponent of p in the numerator is at least as much as in the denominator, then the expression is an integer. Let's try that.\n\nFor a prime p, the exponent of p in (2m)! is sum_{k=1}^∞ floor(2m / p^k). Similarly for (2n)!. In the denominator, the exponents in m!, n!, and (m + n)! would be sum floor(m/p^k), sum floor(n/p^k), and sum floor((m + n)/p^k). So the total exponent in the denominator is sum [floor(m/p^k) + floor(n/p^k) + floor((m + n)/p^k)].\n\nSo we need to show that for all primes p and integers k ≥ 1:\n\nfloor(2m/p^k) + floor(2n/p^k) ≥ floor(m/p^k) + floor(n/p^k) + floor((m + n)/p^k)\n\nIs this inequality true? Let's check with some examples. Suppose m = 3, n = 2, p = 2, k = 1. Then floor(6/2) + floor(4/2) = 3 + 2 = 5. On the right side: floor(3/2) + floor(2/2) + floor(5/2) = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4. So 5 ≥ 4, which holds. Another example: m = 1, n = 1, p = 2, k = 1. Left: 2 + 2 = 4. Right: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. Still holds. Maybe this inequality is generally true.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a combinatorial interpretation. The expression resembles a combination formula. For example, binomial coefficients or multinomial coefficients. Let me think. The term (2m)!/(m! (m + n)!) might relate to some kind of path counting or arranging objects. Alternatively, perhaps it's the product of two binomial coefficients. Wait, (2m choose m) times (2n choose n) divided by (m + n choose n). Because (2m choose m) is (2m)!/(m! m!), and (2n choose n) is similarly (2n)!/(n! n!). Then dividing by (m + n choose n) which is (m + n)!/(m! n!). So multiplying those two binomial coefficients and dividing by (m + n choose n) gives exactly the expression in the problem. So the expression is [(2m choose m) * (2n choose n)] / (m + n choose n). If this is an integer, then the original expression is an integer.\n\nBut how to show that this fraction is an integer? Maybe using combinatorial interpretations. For example, (2m choose m) counts the number of ways to choose m items out of 2m. Similarly for (2n choose n). The denominator (m + n choose n) is the number of ways to choose n items out of m + n. Perhaps there's a way to interpret the entire expression as counting some combinatorial object, which would imply it's an integer.\n\nAlternatively, consider generating functions or use induction. For induction, fix m and vary n, or vice versa. But since both m and n are variables, that might be complicated.\n\nAnother idea: The expression might be related to Catalan numbers or similar combinatorial numbers, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, check if the expression is the number of certain lattice paths, or maybe the number of ways to interleave two sets of objects.\n\nAlternatively, use the property that products of binomial coefficients divided by another binomial coefficient can sometimes be integers if there's a combinatorial structure that accounts for the division. For example, in the case of Catalan numbers, they involve a division by (n+1), which counts certain cyclic permutations, but here it's a different division.\n\nWait, perhaps using Kummer's theorem or Lucas theorem for primes in binomial coefficients. But maybe that's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, look for prime factors in the denominator and ensure they are present in the numerator. Let's consider Legendre's formula approach again. For each prime p, the exponent in the numerator is v_p((2m)! (2n)!) = v_p((2m)!) + v_p((2n)!), and the denominator is v_p(m! n! (m+n)!) = v_p(m!) + v_p(n!) + v_p((m+n)!).\n\nWe need to show that v_p((2m)!) + v_p((2n)!) ≥ v_p(m!) + v_p(n!) + v_p((m+n)!).\n\nRecall that v_p(k!) = sum_{i=1}^∞ floor(k/p^i).\n\nSo, the inequality to prove is:\n\nsum_{i=1}^∞ [floor(2m/p^i) + floor(2n/p^i)] ≥ sum_{i=1}^∞ [floor(m/p^i) + floor(n/p^i) + floor((m + n)/p^i)]\n\nBut since this must hold for each i individually, perhaps it's sufficient to show for each i:\n\nfloor(2m/p^i) + floor(2n/p^i) ≥ floor(m/p^i) + floor(n/p^i) + floor((m + n)/p^i)\n\nSo for each i, we need:\n\nfloor(2m/p^i) + floor(2n/p^i) - floor(m/p^i) - floor(n/p^i) ≥ floor((m + n)/p^i)\n\nLet me denote a = floor(m/p^i), b = floor(n/p^i). Then m = a p^i + r, n = b p^i + s, where 0 ≤ r, s < p^i.\n\nThen 2m = 2a p^i + 2r, so floor(2m/p^i) = 2a + floor(2r/p^i). Similarly floor(2n/p^i) = 2b + floor(2s/p^i).\n\nThe left side becomes (2a + floor(2r/p^i)) + (2b + floor(2s/p^i)) - a - b = a + b + floor(2r/p^i) + floor(2s/p^i).\n\nThe right side is floor((a p^i + r + b p^i + s)/p^i) = floor((a + b) p^i + (r + s))/p^i) = a + b + floor((r + s)/p^i).\n\nTherefore, the inequality reduces to:\n\nfloor(2r/p^i) + floor(2s/p^i) ≥ floor((r + s)/p^i)\n\nBut since r and s are between 0 and p^i - 1, their sum r + s is between 0 and 2p^i - 2.\n\nSo let's consider cases based on the value of r + s.\n\nCase 1: r + s < p^i. Then floor((r + s)/p^i) = 0. We need floor(2r/p^i) + floor(2s/p^i) ≥ 0. Which is always true since both terms are non-negative.\n\nCase 2: p^i ≤ r + s < 2p^i. Then floor((r + s)/p^i) = 1. We need floor(2r/p^i) + floor(2s/p^i) ≥ 1.\n\nLet’s check if this holds. Let’s let t = r + s. Since t ≥ p^i, and r, s < p^i. Let's suppose r and s are such that t = r + s ≥ p^i.\n\nNow, floor(2r/p^i) is either 0 or 1, since 2r < 2p^i. Similarly for floor(2s/p^i).\n\nIf either floor(2r/p^i) ≥1 or floor(2s/p^i) ≥1, then the sum is at least 1.\n\nBut if both floor(2r/p^i) and floor(2s/p^i) are 0, then 2r < p^i and 2s < p^i. So r < p^i/2 and s < p^i/2. Then t = r + s < p^i/2 + p^i/2 = p^i, which contradicts t ≥ p^i. Hence, this case cannot happen. Therefore, in Case 2, the sum floor(2r/p^i) + floor(2s/p^i) must be at least 1. Therefore, the inequality holds.\n\nTherefore, for each prime p and each i ≥1, the inequality holds. Therefore, the exponent of each prime in the numerator is at least that in the denominator. Therefore, the expression is an integer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a combinatorial interpretation. For example, the number of ways to choose m objects from 2m and n objects from 2n, divided by the number of ways to choose n from m + n. But I'm not sure how to visualize that. Alternatively, it's the product of two central binomial coefficients divided by another binomial coefficient. Maybe this counts something like two independent choices divided by a grouping. But I might need to look up if such expressions have known combinatorial meanings.\n\nBut given the Legendre's formula approach works, that's a solid proof. So the answer is that for all non-negative integers m and n, the expression is indeed an integer.",
