    "Content": "On page 146, James Munkres' textbook Topology(2ed), Show that $G$ (a topological group) is Hausdorff. In fact, show that if $x \\neq y$ , there is a neighborhood $V$ of $e$ such that $V \\cdot x$ and $V \\cdot y$ are disjoint. Noticeably, the definition of topological group in Munkres's textbook differs from that in wikipedia . A topological group $G$ is a group that is also a topological space satisfying the $T_1$ axiom , such that the map of $G \\times G$ into $G$ sending $x \\times y$ into $x \\cdot y$ and the map of $G$ into $G$ sending $x$ into $x^{-1}$ , are continuous maps.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "A space $X$ is Hausdorff if and only if the diagonal $\\Delta_X\\subseteq X\\times X$ is closed. Consider the map $G\\times G\\rightarrow G$ given by $(x,y)\\mapsto xy^{-1}$. It is continuous by the axioms for a topological group, and the diagonal is the inverse image of the the identity $\\{e\\}$, which is closed by assumption. So $G$ is Hausdorff if $\\{e\\}$ is closed, i.e., if $G$ is $T_1$ (by homogeneity, $T_1$ for $G$ is equivalent to $\\{e\\}$ being closed). Given $x\\neq y$ in a Hausdorff $G$, let $U_x$ and $U_y$ be disjoint opens around $x$ and $y$, respectively. Both $U_xx^{-1}$ and $U_yy^{-1}$ are opens around $e$, so we can find open $V$ with $e\\in V\\subseteq U_xx^{-1}\\cap U_yy^{-1}$. Then $Vx$ and $Vy$ are disjoint neighborhoods of $x$ and $y$, as desired.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem from Munkres. The user wants me to structure the problem according to the given format. First, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement from the original question. \n\nThe original question is about showing that a topological group G is Hausdorff. Specifically, it mentions that if x ≠ y in G, there exists a neighborhood V of the identity element e such that V·x and V·y are disjoint. The user also notes that Munkres' definition of a topological group includes the T₁ axiom, which might differ from other sources like Wikipedia.\n\nFirst, list all assumptions. The problem is about a topological group G. From Munkres' definition, the assumptions are:\n\n1. G is a group.\n2. G is a topological space.\n3. G satisfies the T₁ axiom.\n4. The map G × G → G defined by (x, y) ↦ x·y is continuous.\n5. The map G → G defined by x ↦ x⁻¹ is continuous.\n\nEach of these should be separate lines in the assumptions. The problem statement is to show that G is Hausdorff, and more specifically, that for any x ≠ y, there's a neighborhood V of e with Vx and Vy disjoint.\n\nWait, the original problem also mentions the T₁ axiom as part of the definition. In some definitions, the T₁ axiom isn't included, but here it is. So the assumptions must include that G is T₁. Then, the problem is to prove that G is Hausdorff. But in the example provided, the assumption included specific conditions on n. Here, the assumptions are the properties of G as a topological group according to Munkres. So each property should be listed: group, topological space, T₁, continuity of multiplication and inverse.\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n- G is a group.\n- G is a topological space.\n- G satisfies the T₁ axiom.\n- The multiplication map (x, y) ↦ x·y is continuous.\n- The inverse map x ↦ x⁻¹ is continuous.\n\nThen the problem is to show that G is Hausdorff, and specifically that for any x ≠ y, there's a neighborhood V of e such that Vx and Vy are disjoint.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is a single line, addressing one property applied to one object. Each of the above points does that. The problem statement includes both the general goal (Hausdorff) and the specific neighborhood condition. But perhaps the main problem is to show G is Hausdorff, with the specific part about Vx and Vy being a hint or a step in the proof. However, the user's example included the specific problem statement as given. In the original question, the problem is to \"Show that G is Hausdorff. In fact, show that if x ≠ y, there is a neighborhood V of e such that V·x and V·y are disjoint.\" So the problem part should include both, but perhaps the main problem is to prove G is Hausdorff by showing the existence of such V. So the problem statement should be as written in the question.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a group,\nG is a topological space,\nG satisfies the T₁ axiom,\nThe multiplication map G × G → G is continuous,\nThe inverse map G → G is continuous.\n\nProblem:\nShow that G is Hausdorff. Specifically, show that if x ≠ y, there exists a neighborhood V of e such that V·x and V·y are disjoint.\n\nWait, but in the example given, the problem was stated as the original problem, even if some assumptions were included. For instance, in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but the formatted problem listed those as assumptions and restated the problem. Here, the original problem's assumptions are the properties of G as per Munkres' definition. So all those properties (group, topological space, T₁, continuous multiplication and inversion) are the assumptions. The problem is to show G is Hausdorff, with the specific neighborhood condition.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91 for every integer n, and the formatted problem listed assumptions: n is integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem said \"for every integer n\", so perhaps in the example, the user made a mistake or altered the assumptions. Wait, the example's original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists assumptions as n is integer and n divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect? Because if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", then the assumption shouldn't include n divisible by 7 unless there's a typo. Maybe that example is not a good one, but according to the user's instruction, we need to follow the format. So regardless, in the current problem, the assumptions are all the conditions given in the definition by Munkres, which include T₁, group, topological space, continuous operations. The problem is to show G is Hausdorff, specifically via the neighborhood condition.\n\nSo the final answer should list those assumptions line by line and the problem as stated.",
