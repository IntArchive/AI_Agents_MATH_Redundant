    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify the main problem and list all assumptions. The original question is about proving an integral involving the natural logarithm over a product of polynomials. The integral is from 0 to infinity of ln(x)/((x²+1)(x³+1)) dx, and the result is supposed to be -37/432 π². The user also mentions a similar integral and asks about a general case with x^a instead of x³, but the main problem here is the specific integral with x³+1.\n\nSo, the assumptions: The integral is from 0 to infinity. The integrand is ln(x) divided by (x²+1)(x³+1). The user is asking to prove the result using real methods, not residue calculus. But wait, in the example given earlier, the assumptions listed were about the variables involved. Here, the problem doesn't have variables with conditions except the integral limits and the integrand's form. The original problem doesn't state any explicit assumptions like n being an integer or divisible by something. However, the integral is over the positive real line, and the integrand has denominators x²+1 and x³+1, which don't vanish for x ≥ 0, so convergence might be an assumption. But since the problem states the integral equals that specific value, the existence of the integral is implied. So maybe the key assumptions are the bounds of integration and the form of the integrand. Also, the user wants real methods, but that's part of the problem request, not an assumption. Wait, in the example, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, there are no variables with conditions except the integral setup. So perhaps the assumptions here are just the integral's structure. Let me check the example again. The example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. In this case, the integral is definite from 0 to infinity, and the integrand is specified. Maybe the assumptions should include that the integral is over the interval [0, ∞), and the integrand is ln(x) divided by (x² +1)(x³ +1). But each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is over the interval [0, ∞),\nThe integrand is (ln x)/[(x² +1)(x³ +1)].\n\nBut wait, the problem is to prove that this integral equals -37/432 π². So the problem statement is the integral expression equals that value. The assumptions are the conditions under which this equality holds. Since the integral is given as definite from 0 to infinity, and the integrand is specified, perhaps the only assumptions are the limits of integration and the form of the integrand. The example had two assumptions: n is integer and n divisible by 7. Here, maybe the integral bounds and the integrand's expression. So each part: integral from 0 to infinity, integrand is ln(x)/((x²+1)(x³+1)).\n\nSo formatted as:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is computed over the interval [0, ∞),\nThe integrand is $\\frac{\\ln x}{(x^2 + 1)(x^3 + 1)}$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\int_0^{\\infty}\\frac{\\ln (x)}{(x^2+1)(x^3+1)}\\ dx=-\\frac{37}{432}\\pi^2$$ using real methods.\n\nBut wait, in the original problem, the user mentions wanting to know if real methods can solve it, as opposed to residue methods. So the problem is to prove the integral equals that value with real methods. Should the method be part of the assumption? The example didn't include method as an assumption. The original example's problem was to prove divisibility by 91, with assumptions on n. Here, the problem is to prove the integral equals that value, and the method constraint (real methods) is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. So the problem part should include \"using real methods\".\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have the problem line as: Prove that [integral] equals ... using real methods.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the assumptions are about the integral setup, and the problem includes the method constraint.",
