    "AcceptedAnswer": "You can evaluate this sum using the residue theorem.  First, note that it may be extended out to $-\\infty$: $$\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^k}{(2 k+1)^3} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^k}{(2 k+1)^3}$$ From the residue theorem: $$\\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^k}{(2 k+1)^3} = -\\text{Res}_{z=-1/2} \\frac{\\pi \\csc{\\pi z}}{(2 z+1)^3} = -\\frac{1}{8}\\text{Res}_{z=-1/2} \\frac{\\pi \\csc{\\pi z}}{( z+1/2)^3} $$ This residue involves taking the second derivative of the csc term.  Note that, for a generic function $f(z)$ having a triple pole at $z=z_0$: $$\\text{Res}_{z=z_0} f(z) = \\frac{1}{2!} \\lim_{z \\rightarrow z_0} \\frac{d^2}{dz^2}[(z-z_0)^3 f(z)]$$ so that $$\\text{Res}_{z=-1/2} \\frac{\\pi \\csc{\\pi z}}{( z+1/2)^3} = \\frac{\\pi^3}{2!} \\left[ \\csc{\\pi z} \\cot^2{\\pi z} + \\csc^3{\\pi z}\\right ]_{z=-1/2} = -\\frac{\\pi^3}{2}$$ Putting this all together, we get the stated result: $$\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^k}{(2 k+1)^3} = \\frac{\\pi^3}{32}$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants to prove that the infinite sum of (-1)^k divided by (2k+1)^3 from k=0 to infinity equals pi^3 over 32. Hmm, I remember that there are some known series involving alternating terms and odd denominators, but the cube in the denominator makes it a bit trickier. \n\nFirst, I recall that the Leibniz formula for pi/4 is an alternating sum of 1/(2k+1), but that's just the first power. Maybe there's a connection to Fourier series or the Riemann zeta function? Wait, the Riemann zeta function at s=3 is involved in some series, but this is an alternating series, so maybe it's related to the Dirichlet eta function. However, the eta function is the alternating zeta function, but here we're only summing over odd integers. So perhaps we can express this series in terms of the eta function or some other special function.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that integrals can sometimes be used to evaluate such series. For example, integrating the series term by term. Let's think about that. The term 1/(2k+1)^3 can be expressed as an integral. Specifically, 1/(2k+1)^3 is equal to the integral from 0 to 1 of x^{2k} times (something) dx, maybe integrating twice. Let me try to write that down.\n\nConsider that for a general term 1/(2k+1)^3, we can represent it using a double integral. For example, ∫₀¹ ∫₀¹ x^{2k} y^{2k} dx dy, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Wait, another approach: recall that 1/(2k+1)^3 can be written as the integral from 0 to 1 of x^{2k} dx integrated appropriately. Let's see:\n\n∫₀¹ x^{2k} dx = 1/(2k+1). Then integrating again: ∫₀¹ ∫₀¹ x^{2k} y^{2k} dx dy would give 1/(2k+1)^2. Hmm, but we need 1/(2k+1)^3. Maybe integrating three times? So:\n\n∫₀¹ ∫₀¹ ∫₀¹ x^{2k} y^{2k} z^{2k} dx dy dz = 1/(2k+1)^3. That seems right. Then, substituting this into the sum, we can interchange the sum and the integrals (if convergence allows), leading to:\n\nSum_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k ∫₀¹ ∫₀¹ ∫₀¹ x^{2k} y^{2k} z^{2k} dx dy dz = ∫₀¹ ∫₀¹ ∫₀¹ Sum_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k (x y z)^{2k} dx dy dz.\n\nThe sum inside is a geometric series: Sum_{k=0}^∞ [(-1)^k (x y z)^{2k}] = Sum_{k=0}^∞ [-(x y z)^2]^k = 1/(1 + (xyz)^2), since it's a geometric series with ratio - (xyz)^2.\n\nSo the triple integral becomes ∫₀¹ ∫₀¹ ∫₀¹ 1/(1 + (x y z)^2) dx dy dz. Hmm, but integrating this over the unit cube might be complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the Fourier series expansion. For example, the Fourier series of a function might have coefficients that relate to such sums. Alternatively, consider the Dirichlet beta function, which is defined as β(s) = Sum_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n / (2n+1)^s. So here, the problem is to show that β(3) = π^3 /32. Yes, the Dirichlet beta function at s=3. I think there are known values for the Dirichlet beta function at odd integers. For example, β(1) = π/4, which is the Leibniz formula. Then β(3) is known to be π^3/32. But how do you prove that?\n\nI recall that for even positive integers, the zeta function has values involving Bernoulli numbers, but for the Dirichlet beta function at odd integers, the values involve Euler numbers or some other special numbers. Alternatively, maybe using the reflection formula or some integral representation.\n\nAnother approach could be using the series expansion of arctangent. Since arctan(z) = Sum_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n z^{2n+1}/(2n+1) for |z| ≤ 1. Then perhaps integrating arctan(z) appropriately to get higher powers. Let's see:\n\nIf we take the integral of arctan(z) from 0 to 1, that might relate to the sum. But let's compute ∫₀¹ arctan(z) dz. Integration by parts: let u = arctan(z), dv = dz. Then du = 1/(1+z^2) dz, v = z. So uv|₀¹ - ∫₀¹ z/(1+z^2) dz = (1 * arctan(1) - 0) - [ (1/2) ln(1+z^2) ]₀¹ = (π/4) - (1/2)(ln 2 - 0) = π/4 - (1/2) ln 2. Hmm, not directly helpful for the sum in question.\n\nBut perhaps considering higher powers. The sum we need is Sum_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k / (2k+1)^3. If we start with the series for arctan(z), integrate term by term, square it, or something. Alternatively, think about the Fourier series of a triangular wave or some other function where the coefficients involve 1/(2k+1)^3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the polylogarithm function. The Dirichlet beta function can be expressed in terms of the Legendre chi function or the polylogarithm. Specifically, β(s) = χ_s(1) where χ is the Legendre chi function, which is related to the polylogarithm. The polylogarithm Li_s(z) is defined as Sum_{k=1}^∞ z^k /k^s, so perhaps β(s) = (Li_s(i) - Li_s(-i))/(2i), but I need to check.\n\nAlternatively, for s=3, perhaps express the sum as an integral involving Li_3 or similar. But maybe that's too advanced.\n\nAnother idea: using Parseval's identity with Fourier series. For example, if we can find a function whose Fourier coefficients correspond to 1/(2k+1)^3, then Parseval's identity might relate the sum of the squares (or some other power) to an integral. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, here's a thought. The sum Sum_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k/(2k+1)^3 can be related to an integral involving the Dirichlet eta function. Let me think about integrating the eta function twice or something.\n\nAlternatively, consider the integral representation of the beta function. For example, using the Gamma function or Beta function integral. Wait, maybe using the integral of t^{2k} from 0 to 1, which is 1/(2k+1). Then, perhaps the cube would come from a triple integral. Let me try again.\n\nExpress 1/(2k+1)^3 as ∫₀¹ ∫₀¹ ∫₀¹ t_1^{2k} t_2^{2k} t_3^{2k} dt_1 dt_2 dt_3. Then the sum becomes:\n\nSum_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k ∫₀¹ ∫₀¹ ∫₀¹ t_1^{2k} t_2^{2k} t_3^{2k} dt_1 dt_2 dt_3.\n\nInterchanging sum and integrals (if allowed), we get:\n\n∫₀¹ ∫₀¹ ∫₀¹ Sum_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k (t_1 t_2 t_3)^{2k} dt_1 dt_2 dt_3.\n\nThe sum inside is a geometric series Sum_{k=0}^\\infty [ - (t_1 t_2 t_3)^2 ]^k = 1 / (1 + (t_1 t_2 t_3)^2 ).\n\nTherefore, the triple integral becomes ∫₀¹ ∫₀¹ ∫₀¹ 1 / (1 + (t_1 t_2 t_3)^2 ) dt_1 dt_2 dt_3. But integrating this seems complicated. Maybe we can make a substitution. Let me denote u = t_1 t_2 t_3. But integrating over three variables with u being the product is non-trivial. Maybe reduce the dimensionality.\n\nAlternatively, fix two variables and integrate over the third. Let's fix t_1 and t_2, then integrate over t_3. Let’s see:\n\nFirst integrate over t_3: ∫₀¹ 1 / (1 + (t_1 t_2 t_3)^2 ) dt_3. Let’s substitute u = t_1 t_2 t_3, then du = t_1 t_2 dt_3, so dt_3 = du/(t_1 t_2). The limits when t_3=0, u=0; t_3=1, u=t_1 t_2. So the integral becomes ∫₀^{t_1 t_2} 1/(1 + u^2) * du/(t_1 t_2) ) = (1/(t_1 t_2)) arctan(u) from 0 to t_1 t_2 = (1/(t_1 t_2)) arctan(t_1 t_2).\n\nSo now the remaining integral over t_1 and t_2 is ∫₀¹ ∫₀¹ (1/(t_1 t_2)) arctan(t_1 t_2) dt_1 dt_2.\n\nHmm, that's still a complicated integral. Let me see if we can make another substitution. Let’s set v = t_1 t_2. Then for fixed t_1, t_2 = v/t_1. But integrating over t_1 and t_2 with v = t_1 t_2 seems tricky. Alternatively, switch to polar coordinates? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, proceed iteratively. Let’s fix t_1 and perform the integral over t_2. Let’s denote the inner integral as ∫₀¹ (1/(t_1 t_2)) arctan(t_1 t_2) dt_2. Let’s substitute w = t_1 t_2, so dw = t_1 dt_2, dt_2 = dw/t_1. When t_2=0, w=0; t_2=1, w=t_1. The integral becomes ∫₀^{t_1} (1/(t_1 * (w/t_1))) arctan(w) * (dw/t_1)) = ∫₀^{t_1} (1/w) arctan(w) * (1/t_1) dw.\n\nSimplifying, (1/t_1) ∫₀^{t_1} arctan(w)/w dw. Let’s call this integral I(t_1). So the entire original triple integral is ∫₀¹ I(t_1) dt_1.\n\nNow, I(t_1) = (1/t_1) ∫₀^{t_1} arctan(w)/w dw. Let’s substitute w = t_1 x, so dw = t_1 dx, and when w=0, x=0; w=t_1, x=1. Then I(t_1) becomes (1/t_1) ∫₀¹ arctan(t_1 x)/(t_1 x) * t_1 dx = ∫₀¹ arctan(t_1 x)/(t_1 x) dx.\n\nHmm, so I(t_1) = ∫₀¹ arctan(t_1 x)/(t_1 x) dx. That seems a bit circular. Maybe differentiate I(t_1) with respect to t_1 to find a differential equation.\n\nLet’s compute dI/dt_1. Using Leibniz rule:\n\ndI/dt_1 = ∫₀¹ [ (x/(1 + (t_1 x)^2 )) * (1/(t_1 x)) - arctan(t_1 x)/(t_1^2 x) ] dx.\n\nWait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe there's another approach.\n\nAlternatively, recall that the sum in question is known to be related to the Catalan constant, but no, the Catalan constant is for the sum over k >=0 of (-1)^k/(2k+1)^2. For the cube, it's known but perhaps relates to a higher constant.\n\nAlternatively, use the identity involving the series expansion of sin or cos functions. For example, integrating term by term. Let me think of another approach.\n\nAnother idea: using the Fourier series of a function. For example, consider the function f(x) = x(π - x) for 0 < x < π, which has a Fourier sine series. But I don't see a direct connection here.\n\nWait, here's a different approach. Consider the integral ∫₀¹ (arctan(t)/t) dt. Let me compute that. Let’s set u = arctan(t), dv = dt/t. Then du = 1/(1 + t^2) dt, v = ln t. Integration by parts gives uv|₀¹ - ∫₀¹ v du = [arctan(t) ln t]₀¹ - ∫₀¹ ln t / (1 + t^2) dt. The first term at t=1 is arctan(1) ln 1 = (π/4)(0) = 0. At t=0, the limit is lim_{t→0} arctan(t) ln t = 0 * (-infty), which is 0. So the integral becomes - ∫₀¹ ln t / (1 + t^2) dt. Hmm, but I'm not sure if this helps.\n\nAlternatively, expand 1/(1 + t^2) as a power series. 1/(1 + t^2) = Sum_{n=0}^\\infty (-1)^n t^{2n} for |t| <1. So the integral becomes - Sum_{n=0}^\\infty (-1)^n ∫₀¹ t^{2n} ln t dt. The integral ∫₀¹ t^{2n} ln t dt can be integrated by parts: let u = ln t, dv = t^{2n} dt. Then du = (1/t) dt, v = t^{2n +1}/(2n +1). So uv|₀¹ - ∫₀¹ v du = [ln t * t^{2n+1}/(2n+1)]₀¹ - ∫₀¹ t^{2n}/(2n+1) dt. The first term is 0 at t=1 and the limit as t→0 is -infty * 0, which is 0. The remaining integral is -1/(2n+1) * ∫₀¹ t^{2n} dt = -1/(2n+1) * [1/(2n +1)] = -1/(2n +1)^2. Therefore, the integral becomes - Sum_{n=0}^\\infty (-1)^n * (-1)/(2n +1)^2) = Sum_{n=0}^\\infty (-1)^n/(2n +1)^2. Wait, but this sum is known as Catalan's constant. However, in our problem, we need the sum involving 1/(2n+1)^3. So this seems different.\n\nBut maybe integrating again. Suppose we consider ∫₀¹ [∫₀¹ (arctan(t s)/t) dt] ds. Then maybe this leads to the triple integral. But this is getting too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, think about using the series expansion of the integral. Let me go back to the original sum: Sum_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k/(2k+1)^3. Let's denote this sum as S. We need to show that S = π^3 /32.\n\nPerhaps use the expansion of the Dirichlet beta function. For example, β(3) can be expressed in terms of π^3. According to some references, β(3) = π^3/32. But how to derive this?\n\nI recall that there's a formula involving the polygamma functions or the Hurwitz zeta function, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, consider using the Fourier series of a Bernoulli polynomial or some other periodic function.\n\nWait, another approach: use the integral representation of 1/(2k+1)^3. Let me recall that for n a positive integer, 1/n^3 = ∫₀¹ ∫₀¹ x^{n-1} y^{n-1} ln(1/x) ln(1/y) dx dy / 2. Not sure if that's helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, use the identity that for s > 1, Sum_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k/(2k+1)^s = β(s), and β(3) is known to be π^3/32. But the user wants a proof of this fact.\n\nPerhaps, referring to some known proofs. For example, using the Fourier series expansion of a cubic polynomial or using contour integration. Alternatively, using the reflection formula for the Dirichlet beta function.\n\nAlternatively, consider using the series expansion of sin(π/4) or something related. Wait, maybe integrating the sum term by term.\n\nLet me try integrating the Leibniz series. We know that Sum_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k/(2k+1) = π/4. If we integrate both sides from 0 to 1, we get Sum_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k/(2k+1)^2) ∫₀¹ x^{2k} dx = ∫₀¹ π/4 dx. Wait, that's not directly helpful. Alternatively, integrating the Leibniz series term by term.\n\nWait, consider integrating the Leibniz series twice. Let's start with:\n\nSum_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k/(2k+1) = π/4.\n\nIntegrate both sides with respect to a variable. Suppose we let the sum be a function of a parameter. Wait, maybe not. Let's try integrating over a variable. Let’s consider integrating from 0 to 1:\n\n∫₀¹ Sum_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k x^{2k} dx = ∫₀¹ π/4 dx.\n\nBut the left side is Sum_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k ∫₀¹ x^{2k} dx = Sum_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k/(2k+1) = π/4, which just gives the original series. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, consider squaring the series. (π/4)^2 = [Sum_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k/(2k+1)]^2. Expanding this gives a double sum Sum_{k,m} (-1)^{k+m}/[(2k+1)(2m+1)]. But this might relate to some integral, but I don't see the connection to the sum of cubes.\n\nAlternatively, use the identity that the sum of 1/(2k+1)^3 can be expressed in terms of the zeta function and the eta function. But since this is an alternating sum, it's already the beta function.\n\nAnother idea: using the partial fractions or the Mittag-Leffler theorem expansion for trigonometric functions. For example, the expansion of secant or tangent functions, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, here's a possible method using the Fourier series of a Bernoulli polynomial. The Bernoulli polynomials have Fourier series expansions that involve terms like 1/n^3, and they are evaluated at specific points to give values involving pi^3. For example, the Fourier series for the Bernoulli polynomial B_3(x) might have coefficients that can be summed to give the desired result. Let me look this up in my mind.\n\nThe Fourier series for B_{2n+1}(x) is something like (-1)^{n+1} 2 (2n+1)! / (2π)^{2n+1} Sum_{k=1}^\\infty sin(2πk x)/k^{2n+1}}. But since our sum is over odd integers and alternating signs, maybe evaluating such a series at x=1/4 or something.\n\nAlternatively, consider the Fourier series expansion of a function that's a cubic polynomial, extended periodically. For example, let’s take f(x) = x^3 in the interval [-π, π], extend it periodically, and compute its Fourier series. The Fourier coefficients would involve integrals of x^3 multiplied by sin(nx) or cos(nx). Then, evaluating at a specific point might relate to the sum in question. However, this seems complicated, but let's try.\n\nThe Fourier series of f(x) = x^3 on [-π, π] can be written as a sum of sine and cosine terms. Since x^3 is an odd function, the Fourier series will only have sine terms. So,\n\nx^3 = Sum_{n=1}^\\infty b_n sin(n x).\n\nThe coefficients b_n are given by (2/π) ∫₀^π x^3 sin(n x) dx.\n\nIntegrate by parts three times. Let’s compute b_n:\n\nb_n = (2/π) ∫₀^π x^3 sin(n x) dx.\n\nLet u = x^3, dv = sin(nx) dx.\n\nFirst integration by parts:\n\ndu = 3x^2 dx, v = -cos(nx)/n.\n\nSo, b_n = (2/π)[ -x^3 cos(nx)/n |₀^π + 3/n ∫₀^π x^2 cos(nx) dx ].\n\nEvaluate the boundary term: at x=π, -π^3 cos(nπ)/n; at x=0, 0. So:\n\n= (2/π)[ -π^3 (-1)^n /n + 3/n ∫₀^π x^2 cos(nx) dx ].\n\nNow, compute the integral ∫₀^π x^2 cos(nx) dx. Again, integrate by parts. Let u = x^2, dv = cos(nx) dx.\n\ndu = 2x dx, v = sin(nx)/n.\n\nSo, integral = x^2 sin(nx)/n |₀^π - 2/n ∫₀^π x sin(nx) dx.\n\nBoundary terms: at x=π, π^2 sin(nπ)/n = 0; at x=0, 0. So:\n\n= -2/n ∫₀^π x sin(nx) dx.\n\nNow, integrate ∫₀^π x sin(nx) dx. Again, by parts: u = x, dv = sin(nx) dx.\n\ndu = dx, v = -cos(nx)/n.\n\nIntegral = -x cos(nx)/n |₀^π + 1/n ∫₀^π cos(nx) dx.\n\nEvaluate boundary terms: -π cos(nπ)/n + 0 + (1/n^2) sin(nx)|₀^π = -π (-1)^n /n + 0.\n\nThus, integral = -π (-1)^n /n.\n\nPutting it back:\n\n∫₀^π x sin(nx) dx = π (-1)^n /n.\n\nTherefore, ∫₀^π x^2 cos(nx) dx = -2/n * π (-1)^n /n = 2π (-1)^n /n^2.\n\nThus, going back to b_n:\n\nb_n = (2/π)[ -π^3 (-1)^n /n + 3/n * 2π (-1)^n /n^2 ] = (2/π)[ π^3 (-1)^{n+1}/n + 6π (-1)^n /n^3 ].\n\nSimplify:\n\n= 2/π [ (-1)^{n+1} π^3 /n + 6π (-1)^n /n^3 ]\n\n= 2/π * π [ (-1)^{n+1} π^2 /n + 6 (-1)^n /n^3 ]\n\n= 2 [ (-1)^{n+1} π^2 /n + 6 (-1)^n /n^3 ]\n\n= 2 [ - (-1)^n π^2 /n + 6 (-1)^n /n^3 ]\n\n= 2 (-1)^n [ -π^2 /n + 6 /n^3 ]\n\nThus, the Fourier series is:\n\nx^3 = Sum_{n=1}^\\infty 2 (-1)^n [ -π^2 /n + 6 /n^3 ] sin(n x).\n\nNow, evaluate this at x = π/2. Then:\n\n(π/2)^3 = Sum_{n=1}^\\infty 2 (-1)^n [ -π^2 /n + 6 /n^3 ] sin(n π/2).\n\nNote that sin(n π/2) is 0 when n is even, 1 when n = 1 mod 4, -1 when n = 3 mod 4. So, for n odd, let n = 2k+1, k = 0,1,2,...\n\nThen:\n\n(π/2)^3 = Sum_{k=0}^\\infty 2 (-1)^{2k+1} [ -π^2/(2k+1) + 6/(2k+1)^3 ] sin((2k+1) π/2).\n\nBut (-1)^{2k+1} = -1, and sin((2k+1)π/2) = (-1)^k.\n\nThus:\n\n(π/2)^3 = Sum_{k=0}^\\infty 2 (-1) [ -π^2/(2k+1) + 6/(2k+1)^3 ] (-1)^k\n\n= Sum_{k=0}^\\infty 2 [ π^2/(2k+1) - 6/(2k+1)^3 ] (-1)^k\n\nTherefore:\n\n(π/2)^3 = 2 π^2 Sum_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k/(2k+1) - 12 Sum_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k/(2k+1)^3\n\nWe know that Sum_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k/(2k+1) = π/4. Plugging that in:\n\n(π/2)^3 = 2 π^2 (π/4) - 12 S\n\nWhere S is the sum we want. So:\n\nπ^3 /8 = (2 π^3 /4) - 12 S\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n2 π^3 /4 = π^3 /2\n\nThus:\n\nπ^3 /8 = π^3 /2 - 12 S\n\nRearranging:\n\n12 S = π^3 /2 - π^3 /8 = (4 π^3 - π^3)/8 = 3 π^3 /8\n\nTherefore:\n\nS = (3 π^3 /8) /12 = π^3 /32\n\nWhich is the desired result. Therefore, the sum equals π³/32.",
