    "Content": "Let $k=\\overline k$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic $0$ , and let $p$ be an odd prime. I want to show that there is no nontrivial automorphism $\\sigma:k\\to k$ with $\\sigma^p=\\mathrm{id}_k$ . (This is a problem from a past exam.) The provided hint suggests to show that if such a $\\sigma$ exists, then a primitive $p$ th root of unity lies in the fixed field $L\\subset k$ of $\\sigma$ , and then to somehow use norms. I can show this first part: if $\\zeta$ is a primitive $p$ th root of $1$ , then $\\sigma(\\zeta)^p = \\sigma(\\zeta^p) = 1$ so $\\sigma(\\zeta)$ is another primitive $p$ th root of $1$ ; hence $\\sigma$ restricts to an automorphism of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta)$ , i.e., an element of $G:=\\mathrm{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta)/\\mathbb{Q})$ . But $G$ has order $p-1$ , so $\\sigma^p = \\sigma$ as elements of $G$ . Since $\\sigma^p=\\mathrm{id}$ , this means $\\sigma$ is itself trivial on $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta)$ , so $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta)\\subset L$ . But at this point I don't really see how to use norms to derive a contradiction. As I understand things, norms only make sense for finite extensions, but the only finite extension in sight is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta)$ , and I don't really see any contradiction to be found there. Meanwhile arbitrary elements of $L$ may not even be algebraic over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta)$ . The only other possible idea I had is to consider the finite Galois extension $F(\\zeta)/F$ for $F=\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$ for $\\alpha\\in k$ , but again I don't see what there is to say about this using norms. Any further hints or suggestions would be appreciated.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "OK, I think I might have found the \"intended\" solution—or at least a solution that follows the hint. Hopefully it does not contain any errors... As Martin Brandenburg points out, $k/L$ is a finite extension; since we're in characteristic $0$ , it is actually a Galois extension, and the fact that $L$ is the fixed field of $\\sigma$ implies that the Galois group is generated by $\\sigma$ . So $k/L$ is a cyclic extension with Galois group $\\mathbb{Z}/p$ . It follows that $N_{k/L}(\\zeta) = 1$ , so we may apply Hilbert 90 to get some $\\alpha\\in k$ such that $\\sigma(\\alpha) = \\zeta\\alpha$ . In particular, $\\alpha\\notin L$ . Since $k$ is algebraically closed, it contains some $\\beta$ with $\\beta^p=\\alpha$ , and \\begin{equation*}\nN_{k/L}(\\beta) = \\prod_{j=0}^{p-1} \\sigma^j(\\beta) = \\alpha\\prod_{j=0}^{p-1}\\frac{\\sigma^j(\\beta)}{\\beta}.\n\\end{equation*} Now observe that \\begin{equation*}\n\\left(\\prod_{j=0}^{p-1}\\frac{\\sigma^j(\\beta)}{\\beta}\\right)^p = \\prod_{j=0}^{p-1}\\frac{\\sigma^j(\\alpha)}{\\alpha} = \\prod_{j=0}^{p-1}\\zeta^j = \\zeta^{p(p-1)/2}= 1,\n\\end{equation*} so in fact \\begin{equation*}\n\\prod_{j=0}^{p-1}\\frac{\\sigma^j(\\beta)}{\\beta} = \\zeta^j\n\\end{equation*} for some $0\\leq j\\leq p-1$ ; in particular, this product is in $L$ . But \\begin{equation*}\nN_{k/L}(\\beta) = \\alpha\\prod_{j=0}^{p-1}\\frac{\\sigma^j(\\beta)}{\\beta} \\in L.\n\\end{equation*} So $\\alpha\\in L$ as well, which is a contradiction with our choice of $\\alpha$ . Hence no such $\\sigma$ can exist.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to structure the given problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The example provided shows that the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then the problem is restated concisely.\n\nOriginal problem is about showing that an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 has no automorphism of odd prime order. The user provided their attempt and some hints they tried.\n\nFirst, I need to extract all the assumptions. The field k is algebraically closed, characteristic 0. The automorphism σ has order p, which is an odd prime. The problem states that there is no nontrivial such automorphism. The assumptions here would be:\n\n1. k is an algebraically closed field.\n2. k has characteristic 0.\n3. σ: k → k is an automorphism.\n4. σ has order p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The problem is to show that no such nontrivial σ exists.\n\nI need to check if the original question mentions all these points. The title says \"An algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 has no automorphism of odd prime order\". The body repeats that k is algebraically closed, char 0, and σ is an automorphism with σ^p = id, and p is an odd prime. So those four assumptions are correct.\n\nThe problem statement is to show there is no nontrivial σ satisfying those conditions. So the formatted problem should list those assumptions and the problem as proving no such σ exists.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"there is no nontrivial automorphism\", so the problem part is \"Prove that there is no nontrivial automorphism σ: k → k with σ^p = id_k\".\n\nBut the user's example had the problem part as \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91\". So in this case, the problem is to prove the non-existence of such an automorphism.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nk is an algebraically closed field,\nk has characteristic 0,\nσ: k → k is an automorphism,\nσ^p = id_k where p is an odd prime.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there is no nontrivial automorphism σ: k → k with σ^p = id_k.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. The original problem in the example had a condition that might not be explicitly stated (the user added n divisible by 7). But in this case, the problem is as given. The user's original problem says that k is algebraically closed, char 0, and p is an odd prime. The automorphism σ is nontrivial with σ^p = id. So the problem is to show no such σ exists. The assumptions would include all the given conditions. So the key points are:\n\n- k is algebraically closed.\n\n- char k = 0.\n\n- σ is an automorphism of k.\n\n- σ has order p (i.e., σ^p = id), where p is an odd prime.\n\nEach of these should be separate assumptions. Then the problem is to prove there's no nontrivial such σ.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nk is an algebraically closed field,\nk has characteristic 0,\nσ: k → k is an automorphism,\nσ^p = id_k where p is an odd prime.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there is no nontrivial automorphism σ: k → k with σ^p = id_k.\n\nBut wait, in the example, they separated the assumptions into different lines, each with one condition. So each bullet point is a separate assumption. So in this case, the assumptions are four separate points. The problem is the statement to prove.\n\nBut the original problem's title is \"has no automorphism...\", so the problem is to prove that such a σ doesn't exist. So the problem part would be \"Prove that there is no nontrivial automorphism σ: k → k with σ^p = id_k\".\n\nI think that's correct. The user's example included the assumptions and problem. The assumptions here are the properties of k and σ, and the problem is to show no such σ exists. So the formatted answer should follow this structure.",
