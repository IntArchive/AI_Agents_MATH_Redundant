Any idea? I am going to show my proof of $(1)$ hoping it helps you prove $(2)$ : We showed in this question that $$\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\frac{4^ny^n}{n^2{2n\\choose n}}=2\\int_0^y \\frac{\\arcsin \\sqrt{x}}{\\sqrt{x}\\sqrt{1-x}}dx$$ multiply both sides by $\\frac{1}{y\\sqrt{1-y}}$ then $\\int_0^1$ with respect to $y$ and use $\\int_0^1\\frac{y^{n-1}}{\\sqrt{1-y}}dy=\\frac{4^n}{n{2n\\choose n}}$ we obtain $$\\sum _{n=1}^{\\infty } \\frac{16^n}{n^3 \\binom{2 n}{n}^2}=2\\int_0^1\\int_0^y \\frac{\\arcsin \\sqrt{x}}{y\\sqrt{x}\\sqrt{1-x}\\sqrt{1-y}}dxdy$$ $$=2\\int_0^1\\frac{\\arcsin\\sqrt{x}}{\\sqrt{x}\\sqrt{1-x}}\\left(\\int_x^1\\frac{dy}{y\\sqrt{1-y}}\\right)dx$$ $$=2\\int_0^1\\frac{\\arcsin\\sqrt{x}}{\\sqrt{x}\\sqrt{1-x}}\\left(2\\ln(1+\\sqrt{1-x})-\\ln x\\right)dx$$ $$\\overset{\\sqrt{x}=\\sin \\theta}{=}8\\int_0^{\\pi/2}x\\ln(1+\\cos x)dx-8\\int_0^{\\pi/2}x\\ln(\\sin x)dx$$ $$=8\\int_0^{\\pi/2}x\\ln(2\\cos^2\\frac x2)dx-8\\int_0^{\\pi/2}x\\ln(\\sin x)dx$$ $$=32\\int_0^{\\pi/4}x\\ln(2\\cos^2x)dx-8\\int_0^{\\pi/2}x\\ln(\\sin x)dx$$ $$=32\\underbrace{\\int_0^{\\pi/4}x\\ln(2)dx}_{\\frac3{16}\\ln(2)\\zeta(2)}+64\\underbrace{\\int_0^{\\pi/4}x\\ln(\\cos x)dx}_{\\frac{\\pi}{8}\\text{G}-\\frac3{16}\\ln(2)\\zeta(2)-\\frac{21}{128}\\zeta(3)}-8\\underbrace{\\int_0^{\\pi/2}x\\ln(\\sin x)dx}_{\\frac7{16}\\zeta(3)-\\frac34\\ln(2)\\zeta(2)}$$ $$=8\\pi\\text{G}-14 \\zeta (3)$$ The last two integrals follow from using the Fourier series of $\\ln(\\cos x)$ and $\\ln(\\sin x)$ . All approaches are appreciated. Thank you. Addendum: Here is an easier way to prove $(1)$ : We have $$\\arcsin^2(x)=\\frac12\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\frac{(2x)^{2n}}{n^2{2n\\choose n}}$$ or $$\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\frac{4^nx^n}{n^2{2n\\choose n}}=2\\arcsin^2(\\sqrt{x})$$ Divide both sides by $x\\sqrt{1-x}$ then $\\int_0^1$ and use $\\int_0^1\\frac{x^{n-1}}{\\sqrt{1-x}}dx=\\frac{4^n}{n{2n\\choose n}}$ we have $$\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\frac{16^n}{n^3{2n\\choose n}^2}=2\\int_0^1\\frac{\\arcsin^2(\\sqrt{x})}{x\\sqrt{1-x}}dx$$ $$\\overset{\\sqrt{x}=\\sin x}{=}4\\int_0^{\\pi/2}x^2 \\csc(x)dx$$ $$\\overset{IBP}{=}-8\\int_0^{\\pi/4} x\\ln(\\tan\\frac x2)dx=8\\pi\\text{G}-14\\zeta(3)$$ where the last result follows from the Fourier series of $\\ln(\\tan\\frac x2)$ .",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Too long for a comment (from Cornel ) Well, the elementary tools presented by OP are enough to immediately get a reduction to single integrals by simple integrations by parts and changing of integration order. So, the series is equal to $$\\sum _{n=1}^{\\infty } \\frac{16^n}{\\displaystyle n^4 \\binom{2 n}{n}^2}=\\int _0^1\\frac{1}{z\\sqrt{1-z}}\\left(\\int _0^z\\frac{1}{y}\\left(\\int _0^y\\frac{2 \\arcsin(\\sqrt{x})}{\\sqrt{x (1-x)}}\\textrm{d}x \\right)\\textrm{d}y \\right)\\textrm{d}z$$ $$=-32\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\arctan^2(x)\\log (x)}{x} \\textrm{d}x-\\frac{64}{3} \\int_0^1 \\arctan^3(x) \\textrm{d}x-\\frac{64}{3} \\int_0^1 \\arctan^3(x)\\log (x)\\textrm{d}x,$$ and the desired result follows from using that $$\\int_0^{1} \\frac{\\arctan(x)^2\\log (x)}{x} \\textrm{d}x$$ $$=\\operatorname{Li}_4\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)+\\frac{1}{24}\\log ^4(2)+\\frac{7}{8}\\log (2)\\zeta (3) -\\frac{151 }{11520}\\pi ^4-\\frac{1}{24}\\log ^2(2)\\pi ^2,$$ which requires some special techniques. For example, user Song has already posted on site a solution where contour integration is cleverly exploited, but also other clever ways are possible. Then, $$\\int_0^1 \\arctan^3(x) \\textrm{d}x=\\frac{\\pi ^3}{64}+\\frac{3}{32} \\pi ^2 \\log (2)-\\frac{3 }{4}\\pi G+\\frac{63 }{64}\\zeta(3),$$ which is trivial (variable change and Fourier series). Next, $$ \\int_0^1 \\arctan^3(x)\\log (x)\\textrm{d}x$$ $$=\\frac{3 }{4}\\pi G-\\frac{3}{32}  \\log (2)\\pi ^2+\\frac{3}{8} \\log ^2(2) \\pi ^2-\\frac{\\pi ^3}{64}+\\frac{361 }{2560}\\pi ^4-\\frac{63 }{64}\\zeta (3)-\\frac{21}{16} \\log (2)\\zeta (3) -\\frac{3}{16}\\log ^4(2)-3 \\pi  \\Im\\{\\text{Li}_3(1+i)\\}-\\frac{9 }{2}\\operatorname{Li}_4\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right),$$ which combine Fourier series and the method of Random Variable in this post Looking for closed-forms of $\\int_0^{\\pi/4}\\ln^2(\\sin x)\\,dx$ and $\\int_0^{\\pi/4}\\ln^2(\\cos x)\\,dx$ . The fourier series in the book, (Almost) Impossible Integrals, Sums, and Series , page $243$ , eq. $3.281$ , may also be found extremely useful after the integral tranformation into a trigonometric one. Furthermore, good to know that instead of Random Variable 's way where necessary we can try to adjust and use the strategy in this post, https://math.stackexchange.com/q/3798026 . A first note: By similar means, one can calculate the version, $$\\displaystyle \\sum _{n=1}^{\\infty } \\frac{16^n}{\\displaystyle n^5 \\binom{2 n}{n}^2}.$$ A second note: Most apparently advanced integrals and series flying around the site this period of time are easily manageable mostly by simple techniques. For example, one can calculate advanced nontrivial harmonic series of weights, $8$ , $9$ , $10$ , $11$ , $12$ by only combining and using elementary identities with harmonic numbers, nothing advanced is necessary . Surely, advanced methods are embraced and appreciated as well.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem from the Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me start by reading through the original question carefully.\n\nThe user is asking about how to approach the sum \\(\\sum _{n=1}^{\\infty } \\frac{16^n}{n^4 \\binom{2 n}{n}^2}\\). They mention they were able to prove a similar sum with \\(n^3\\) in the denominator but are having difficulty with the \\(n^4\\) case. They also provide their proof for the \\(n^3\\) case, which involves integral transformations and special functions like the polylogarithm.\n\nFirst, I need to filter out the unrelated information. The user's proof of the \\(n^3\\) case and the addendum are part of their attempt but aren't part of the problem they're asking about. The actual problem is to prove the second equation given for the sum with \\(n^4\\).\n\nLooking at the problem statement in the question, the user presents two results: equation (1) for the \\(n^3\\) case and equation (2) for the \\(n^4\\) case. The problem they need help with is proving equation (2), so that's the main focus.\n\nNow, I need to list the assumptions. The problem is about an infinite series, so the assumptions would relate to the conditions under which the series converges or any properties of the terms. However, the user didn't explicitly state any assumptions beyond the series expression. The binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{2n}{n}\\) is defined for positive integers \\(n\\), so the series starts at \\(n=1\\). The original problem might assume that the series converges, but since the user is asking for a proof of the closed-form expression, perhaps the convergence is established elsewhere. However, in the example provided, the assumption included specific conditions on \\(n\\). In this case, since the problem is about evaluating an infinite sum, possible assumptions could be that the sum is taken over positive integers \\(n\\), and perhaps that the series converges. But the example given in the problem format didn't include convergence as an assumption, just the conditions on the variables. \n\nWait, looking back at the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the assumptions were that \\(n\\) is an integer and divisible by 7. But in the current problem, the sum is from \\(n=1\\) to infinity, and the question is about evaluating the sum. However, the user hasn't specified any particular conditions on \\(n\\) beyond it being a summation index. Therefore, the main assumption here is that the summation is over all positive integers \\(n\\). But perhaps there's more. Wait, in the problem statement, the user provides the result involving polylogarithms and other special functions. These typically have their own domains of convergence, but since the result is given, maybe the assumption is that the series converges to the given closed-form expression. However, the problem is to prove that equality, so the assumptions would be the standard conditions under which such series converge. But since the user is directly asking to prove the equality, perhaps there are no explicit assumptions beyond the series definition. The example had an assumption on \\(n\\), but here, since it's an infinite series, maybe the only assumption is that \\(n\\) is a positive integer. Alternatively, the problem might assume convergence, but since the user is presenting a closed-form, maybe the key assumption is that the series converges and can be evaluated using the given expression. However, in the example, the assumption included specific properties (n is integer and divisible by 7). Here, since the problem is about an infinite sum, perhaps the main assumption is that \\(n\\) ranges over positive integers. But the problem is to evaluate the sum, so maybe the assumption is just that the series is starting from \\(n=1\\). Let me check the example again. In the example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer \\(n\\), but the user added an assumption that \\(n\\) is divisible by 7. Wait, actually in the example, the original problem's assumption was that \\(n\\) is an integer, and the formatted problem included that plus \\(n\\) is divisible by 7. Wait, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer \\(n\\), the number [...] is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem then listed assumptions: \\(n\\) is an integer, \\(n\\) is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the example had a mistake. Let me check. The original problem in the example says \"for every integer \\(n\\)\", but the formatted problem lists assumptions as \\(n\\) is an integer, \\(n\\) is divisible by 7. That seems like an error. Wait, perhaps the example was a misapplication. Because if the original problem says \"for every integer \\(n\\)\", then the assumption should just be that \\(n\\) is an integer. But the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which would actually change the problem. That seems like a mistake. Hmm, perhaps the example is incorrect. But given that, perhaps the user intended to modify the problem. Maybe the example was a misrepresentation. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a different assumption. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the example. If the original problem is to prove for every integer \\(n\\), then the assumption should not include divisibility by 7 unless it's part of the problem's conditions. So perhaps there was an error in the example. However, given that, perhaps in the current problem, we need to follow the structure, but focus on the actual problem's conditions.\n\nBack to the current problem: the user wants to prove the sum equals the given expression. The problem is to prove that the infinite sum equals the closed-form involving polylogarithms, zeta functions, etc. The assumptions here would be that \\(n\\) is a positive integer (since the sum starts at \\(n=1\\)), and perhaps any convergence conditions necessary. However, since the problem is presented as given, and the user is asking for a proof of the equality, the main assumption is that the series is taken over positive integers \\(n\\). Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- \\(n\\) is a positive integer.\n\nThat's the only assumption directly related to the problem's variables. The series is defined for \\(n \\geq 1\\), and each term involves \\(n\\) in the denominator and binomial coefficients, which are defined for positive integers. There's no additional condition mentioned in the problem statement, so the main assumption is that \\(n\\) ranges over positive integers.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n$n$ is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum _{n=1}^{\\infty } \\frac{16^n}{n^4 \\binom{2 n}{n}^2}=64 \\pi  \\Im(\\text{Li}_3(1+i))+64 \\text{Li}_4\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)-233 \\zeta(4)-40  \\ln ^2(2)\\zeta(2)+\\frac{8}{3}\\ln ^4(2).$$\n\nWait, but in the example, they included an assumption that wasn't originally in the problem. The original problem was to prove for every integer \\(n\\), but in the formatted problem, they added that \\(n\\) is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. So perhaps the example is flawed. But following the instructions, I should list all assumptions of the problem. In the current problem, the user hasn't specified any additional conditions, so the only assumption is that \\(n\\) is a positive integer, which is implicit in the summation from \\(n=1\\) to infinity. Therefore, that should be the assumption.\n\nAnother point: the problem involves binomial coefficients \\(\\binom{2n}{n}\\), which are defined for non-negative integers \\(n\\), so \\(n\\) must be at least 0. But since the sum starts at \\(n=1\\), \\(n\\) is positive integer.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would have the assumption that \\(n\\) is a positive integer, and the problem is to prove the given equality for the infinite series.",
