    "Content": "Basically, I tried proving that multiplying an odd and even number together gives you an even number to a friend of mine. This is what I said. Let's first take a random number $k$. It doesn't matter if its odd or even. If we then multiply this by $2$, we get an even number (from the definition of a even number, which is basically a number that can be divided by $2$). Now we know that in the number line, it goes odd, even, odd, even,..., and so if we add $1$ to this, then we get an odd number. We now have an odd number and an even number and so lets multiply them. $$2k \\cdot (2k + 1) = 2k(2k + 1) = 4k^2 + 2k) = 2(2k^2 + k)$$ We now have a random number $(2k^2 + k)$ multiplied by $2$ and so this is an even number (by definition of an even number). My friend then said that we make the assumption that $2k \\pm 1$ is odd because the number line alternates between odd and even numbers, how do know that this is true? I was thinking how to prove this. Would it be by some form of induction? EDIT: I think I need to change \"number\" to \"integer\" in this post don't I?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I wouldn't appeal to the fact that the integers alternate between even and odd. I would say this: An even number is defined as any integer of the form $2k$ for $k$ any integer (maybe excluding $k=0$). An odd number is defined as any integer of the form $2k +1$ for any integer $k$. You can just take this as the definition. And then (as you have) the proof that even times odd is even is just\n$$\n2k(2k'+1) = 2[k(2k'+1)]\n$$\nwhere of course $k(2k'+1)$ is just an integer.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants to know how we can be sure that numbers alternate between odd and even. Their friend challenged the assumption that 2k ±1 is odd, questioning the alternation on the number line.\n\nFirst, I need to clarify if we're talking about integers. The original proof used \"number,\" but the user mentioned changing it to \"integer,\" which makes sense since parity (odd/even) is defined for integers. So the first assumption is that we're dealing with integers.\n\nNext, the definition of even and odd numbers. An even integer is any integer that can be written as 2k where k is an integer. An odd integer is one that can be written as 2k +1. But how does this lead to alternation?\n\nLet's consider starting from an even number. If you add 1 to an even number (2k), you get 2k +1, which is odd. Then, adding 1 again to the odd number gives 2k +2 = 2(k+1), which is even. This alternates every time you add 1. Similarly, subtracting 1 from an even number gives an odd, and so on. So the key operations here are adding or subtracting 1, which flip the parity.\n\nBut does this hold for all integers? What about negative numbers? Well, the definitions still apply. For example, -2 is even, -1 is odd, 0 is even, 1 is odd, etc. So the alternation continues on both sides of zero.\n\nThe user mentioned induction. Maybe we can use mathematical induction to prove that integers alternate parity. Start with a base case, say 0, which is even. Then assume some integer n is even, then n+1 must be odd. Then if n+1 is odd, n+2 is even, and so on. Similarly for negative numbers by decreasing.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the division algorithm. Any integer divided by 2 leaves a remainder of 0 or 1. If it's 0, the number is even; if 1, it's odd. So consecutive integers will have remainders 0,1,0,1,... hence alternating.\n\nBut the core assumptions here are that integers are defined with these parity properties, and that adding 1 toggles the remainder when divided by 2. So the problem reduces to showing that consecutive integers have different parity.\n\nThe problem statement needs to be structured into assumptions and the problem itself. The user's friend is questioning the alternation, so the problem is to prove that integers alternate between odd and even. The assumptions would include that we're dealing with integers, the definitions of even and odd, and perhaps that adding 1 changes the parity.\n\nWait, but in the example provided, the assumption included specific conditions like n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the main assumptions are that the numbers in question are integers and the standard definitions of even and odd apply. However, since the friend is questioning the alternation, maybe we need to state that the problem assumes the definitions but needs to prove the alternation.\n\nSo the formatted problem would list assumptions about integers and their parity definitions, then ask to prove alternation. Let me check the example again. The example listed assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7, then the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. So here, similarly, the assumptions should be the foundational definitions needed, and the problem is to prove the alternation.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The numbers in question are integers.\n- An even integer is defined as 2k where k is an integer.\n- An odd integer is defined as 2k + 1 where k is an integer.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that consecutive integers alternate between odd and even.\n\nBut the original question in the problem is \"How do we know all numbers alternate between odd and even numbers?\" So perhaps the problem is to prove that the integers alternate between odd and even, i.e., for any integer n, n and n+1 have opposite parity.\n\nSo structuring that:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The numbers considered are integers.\n- An even integer can be expressed as 2k for some integer k.\n- An odd integer can be expressed as 2k + 1 for some integer k.\n\nProblem:\nProve that consecutive integers alternate between odd and even.\n\nAlternatively, in the example, the user included specific conditions on n (integer and divisible by 7). Here, maybe the key assumptions are that we are dealing with integers, and the definitions of even and odd as per the expressions. Then the problem is to prove alternation.\n\nI think that's the structure needed. Let me write that out.",
