    "Content": "Suppose that V and W are vector spaces with the same dimension. We wish to show that V is isomorphic to W , i.e. show that there exists a bijective linear function, mapping from V to W . I understand that it will suffice to find a linear function that maps a basis of V to a basis of W . This is because any element of a vector space can be written as a unique linear combination of its basis elements. However I'm not sure how to show that such a map exists.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Just write it down. That is, given a basis $\\{ e_i \\ | i = 1..n \\}$ of $V$ and $\\{ f_i \\ | i = 1..n \\}$ of $W$ define $T : V \\rightarrow W$ first on the basis vectors, $$T(e_i) = f_i \\ \\ \\ \\ \\text{ for each } i = 1, 2, ..., n$$ Now how would you extend $T$ to all of $V$?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to show that two vector spaces V and W of the same finite dimension are isomorphic. The key here is to construct a linear map that's bijective. \n\nFirst, the assumptions. Both V and W are vector spaces. Their dimensions are the same, which is finite. The problem is to prove the existence of an isomorphism between them. \n\nThe user mentioned that mapping a basis of V to a basis of W would suffice. That makes sense because a linear map is determined by where it sends the basis vectors. If we take a basis for V and map each basis vector to a corresponding one in W, then this map should be linear and bijective. \n\nWait, but how do we know such a map exists? Well, since both spaces have the same dimension, any basis for V has the same number of vectors as a basis for W. So we can pair them up. Let's say dim V = dim W = n. Take a basis {v1, v2, ..., vn} for V and a basis {w1, w2, ..., wn} for W. Define a linear transformation T: V → W by T(vi) = wi for each i, and extend linearly. \n\nThen, any vector in V can be written uniquely as a linear combination of the vi's, and T will map it to the same combination of wi's. Since the wi's are a basis, this map is onto. Also, the kernel of T is zero because if a linear combination of wi's is zero, all coefficients must be zero, which means the original vector in V was zero. Hence, T is injective. Therefore, T is an isomorphism.\n\nBut the user is unsure how to formally show the existence. So the structured problem needs to capture the essential assumptions: V and W are vector spaces, they have the same finite dimension. The problem is to prove there exists a bijective linear map between them. \n\nI need to make sure the assumptions are listed correctly. Each assumption should be a single property. So first, V is a vector space. Second, W is a vector space. Third, the dimension of V is equal to the dimension of W. Fourth, the dimension is finite. Then the problem is to show they are isomorphic.",
