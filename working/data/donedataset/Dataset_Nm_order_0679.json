    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. The example provided shows that the Assumptions section lists each condition applied to one object, line by line. Then the Problem section states the actual question.\n\nLooking at the original problem from Math Stack Exchange: the title is about an infinite product, and the question is asking for a more elementary proof of Euler's Sine Expansion formula without using Complex Analysis or Fourier Series. The user also mentions that all current proofs rely on those advanced methods.\n\nSo, first, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem statement is about proving the identity for sin(x)/x as an infinite product. The assumptions here would relate to the conditions under which this product holds. But looking at the example, the assumptions were about the variable (n being an integer and divisible by 7). However, in the given problem, the original question doesn't specify any particular conditions on x or k beyond what's in the product itself. The product is from k=1 to infinity, and the expansion is for sin(x)/x. \n\nWait, but maybe the assumptions here are implicit. For Euler's product formula, the identity holds for all real numbers x (or complex numbers). But the problem as stated in the question doesn't list specific assumptions; it's asking for an elementary proof. However, in the example, the assumption included conditions on n. Here, perhaps the assumptions would be about the convergence of the product or the domain of x. But since the user didn't specify any in the original question, maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond the standard ones for the product representation.\n\nBut the example included an assumption that wasn't actually in the original problem (the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted example, an assumption was added that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. Wait, that seems odd. Let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. Formatted problem's assumption says n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that's conflicting. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted version adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Maybe the example was a mistake? Or perhaps the user intended to filter out unrelated information. Hmm, this is confusing. If the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted version adds \"n is divisible by 7\", that's changing the problem. That might be an error in the example. But maybe the user intended to show that sometimes assumptions are extracted from the problem even if they are part of the universal quantifier. Alternatively, perhaps in the example, the original problem had a different condition, but here the user wants to structure the problem by listing all assumptions. \n\nBut given the confusion, perhaps for the current problem, the main assumption is that the product is from k=1 to infinity, and that x is a real or complex number where the product converges. But the original problem statement doesn't specify any restrictions on x, so maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond what's in the product expression. However, in mathematical proofs, the convergence of the infinite product is essential. So perhaps the assumption is that the infinite product converges, but since the problem is to prove the equality, maybe the assumptions are that x is such that the product converges. However, in the example, the assumption included a condition that wasn't in the original problem (divisible by 7). Wait, perhaps the example is incorrect, but I need to follow the user's instruction regardless.\n\nGiven that, perhaps for the current problem, the only assumptions are those inherent in the problem statement. The problem is to prove that sin(x)/x equals the infinite product. So the assumptions would be that x is a real number (or complex), and that the product is taken from k=1 to infinity. But the original problem doesn't state any restrictions, so maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond the structure of the product. However, the user's example included an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". That seems contradictory. Perhaps in the example, the user made a mistake, but I have to follow the format.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example is correct in that the original problem had an error, and the user filtered out unrelated information. Wait, the original example's problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem's assumption includes that n is divisible by 7. That changes the problem. Maybe there was a misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem had additional conditions that the user considered as assumptions. But given the example, perhaps the user wants to list the domain of variables as assumptions. So in the current problem, the variable x is real or complex, and k is a positive integer. But the problem statement doesn't specify restrictions on x. However, since it's an infinite product, convergence is necessary. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions are that x is such that the product converges. But in the absence of explicit conditions in the original problem, I might need to infer. However, the user's example added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (n divisible by 7), so perhaps the user wants to list the domain of variables as assumptions. For the current problem, the assumptions could be that x is a real number and k is a positive integer. But the product is from k=1 to infinity, so k is a positive integer. But since the problem is to prove the equality, perhaps the key assumptions are that x is a real number (or complex) and the product is over all positive integers k. But the original problem doesn't specify any restrictions, so maybe the assumptions are just the components of the product. Alternatively, the problem might have no explicit assumptions beyond the product expression. The example given by the user seems to include an incorrect assumption, but following that, perhaps for the current problem, the assumptions are simply that the product is taken from k=1 to infinity. But since the example listed two assumptions (n is an integer, n divisible by 7), perhaps here we can list the components: the product is infinite, k ranges over positive integers, and the terms are (1 - x²/(k²π²)). However, the user's format says each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe product is taken over all positive integers k,\nEach term of the product is (1 - x²/(k²π²)),\nx is a real number,\nThe infinite product converges.\n\nBut the original problem doesn't state these assumptions; it's part of the problem to prove the equality holds under what conditions. The question is asking for an elementary proof, not specifying any particular assumptions. So perhaps the only explicit assumption is the structure of the product, but since the example included assumptions from the problem statement (even if they were part of the original problem's universal quantifier), I need to extract the key components. Alternatively, maybe the problem doesn't have any specific assumptions beyond the product expression itself. In the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which was translated into an assumption that n is an integer, and another that n is divisible by 7 (which might be a mistake). Given that confusion, perhaps for the current problem, the assumptions are simply that the product is as defined, and x is a variable. But the user's example included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (n divisible by 7), which might indicate that the user wants to filter out conditions from the problem. Alternatively, maybe the example was a typo. Given the uncertainty, perhaps the safest approach is to list the components of the problem as assumptions, such as the product being infinite, each term's form, and x being a variable. But since the problem is to prove the equality, the key assumptions are the terms of the product and the infinite product's structure. \n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to prove that sin(x)/x equals the product, the assumptions are the definitions of the product. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe infinite product is defined as ∏_{k=1}^∞ (1 - x²/(k²π²)),\nThe sine function is defined as its Taylor series or some other elementary definition.\n\nBut the problem is asking for an elementary proof without complex analysis or Fourier series, so maybe the assumption is that the proof should use elementary methods. However, the user's format requires assumptions about the problem's conditions, not about the proof method. The example's assumptions were about the variable n, not about the proof technique. So probably, the assumptions here are about the variables and the product's structure.\n\nGiven all that, I think the assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number,\nk is a positive integer,\nThe product is taken from k=1 to infinity.\n\nBut the original problem doesn't state that x is real; it could be complex. But since the user is asking for an elementary proof, perhaps they assume x is real. However, without explicit information, it's safer to list the components of the product. Each term is (1 - x²/(k²π²)), and the product is infinite. So the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nThe product is ∏_{k=1}^∞ (1 - x²/(k²π²)),\nThe function sin(x)/x is considered.\n\nBut the example's assumptions were about the variable's properties. Here, the problem is to relate sin(x)/x to the product. Given the example, maybe the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number,\nk ranges over positive integers,\nThe infinite product converges.\n\nBut since the problem is to prove the equality, the convergence might be part of the proof rather than an assumption. The example had the user adding an assumption (n divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem, which might have been a mistake. Therefore, perhaps in this case, the only assumptions are the structure of the product and the function sin(x)/x. But the example shows that assumptions are about the variables and their conditions.\n\nGiven the confusion, I think the correct approach is to list the key components of the problem as assumptions, each addressing one property. Since the problem is to show that sin(x)/x equals the infinite product, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe function sin(x) is defined,\nx is a real number,\nThe infinite product ∏_{k=1}^∞ (1 - x²/(k²π²)) is considered.\n\nBut the problem doesn't state that x is real; maybe it's complex. However, since the user is looking for an elementary proof, perhaps real numbers are intended. Alternatively, the assumptions might just be the product expression and the function. But following the example's structure, where the assumptions were about the variable n, here the assumptions would be about x and k. However, the problem statement doesn't restrict x, so maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond the product's form. Therefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nThe infinite product is ∏_{k=1}^∞ (1 - x²/(k²π²)).\n\nProblem:\nProve that (sin(x)/x) equals the infinite product.\n\nBut the example had two assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. So perhaps for the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nk is a positive integer,\nThe product is taken over all positive integers k,\nEach term of the product is (1 - x²/(k²π²)).\n\nBut each assumption line should address only one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\nk is a positive integer,\nThe product is taken from k=1 to infinity,\nEach term in the product is (1 - x²/(k²π²)).\n\nBut perhaps that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, the problem's assumptions might just be the product expression, which is given. The problem is to prove the equality, so the key assumption is that the product is defined as such. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nThe infinite product ∏_{k=1}^∞ (1 - x²/(k²π²)) is considered.\n\nProblem:\nProve that (sin(x)/x) equals the infinite product.\n\nBut the example split the assumptions into two lines. In the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted version listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. However, the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7, so that seems like a mistake. Given that, perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user still wants us to follow the format. Therefore, for the current problem, the assumptions are the necessary conditions for the product to equal sin(x)/x. Since the problem is to prove the equality, the assumptions would be the conditions under which the equality holds. However, in the absence of explicit conditions in the problem statement, perhaps the only assumption is the product's definition. But to adhere to the example's structure (even if it's possibly flawed), perhaps list the product's structure and the variables involved.\n\nIn conclusion, after considering all these factors, I'll structure the problem with the assumptions being the definition of the infinite product and possibly the domain of x, even if it's not explicitly stated, to match the example's format.",
