    "Content": "$$\\sum\\limits_{n\\ge1}\\frac1{n^2}=\\sum\\limits_{n\\ge1}\\frac3{n^2\\binom{2n}n}\\tag1$$ Note that $(1)$ holds since the LHS is given by $\\zeta(2)$ whereas the RHS by $6\\arcsin^2 1$ which both equal $\\dfrac{\\pi^2}6$ as it is well-known. However, I am interested in proving $(1)$ without actually evaluating both series. I am aware of an elegant approach contributed by Markus Scheuer as an answer to Different methods to compute Basel problem . Although this answers my question partially I am looking for different attempts. For example within Jack D'Aurizio 's notes there is a way proposed exploiting creative telescoping $($ see page $5$ f. $)$ , which I do not understand completely (yet).\nHence I have come across a proof of a similar equality concerning $\\zeta(3)$ on AoPS given by pprime I am\nconfident that there are in fact other possible methods. I would like to see attempts of proving $(1)$ besides the ones mentioned which do not rely on actually showing that they both equal $\\dfrac{\\pi^2}6$ . Preferably these should be in the spirit of Markus Scheuer 's or Jack D'Aurizio 's approaches rather than the one similar by pprime . Thanks in advance! EDIT I I have found another interesting approach, again by Jack D'Aurizio , which can be found here utilizing harmonic sums and creative telescoping in combination. EDIT II As pointed out by Zacky on page $31$ of Jack 's notes another method can be found which makes it three possibilities provided by Jack alone. Quite impressive!",

Since we have $$\n\\frac{1}{\\binom{2n}{n}}\n=\\frac{n!n!}{(2n)!}\n$$ by the binomial identity, we obtain $$\n\\frac{1}{n^2\\binom{2n}{n}}\n=\\frac{(n-1)!(n-1)!}{(2n)!}\n=\\frac{\\color{purple}{\\Gamma(n)\\Gamma(n)}}{2n\\color{purple}{\\Gamma(n+n)}}=\\frac{1}{2n}\\color{purple}{B(n,n)}\n$$ Therefore we get \\begin{align*}\n\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2\\binom{2n}{n}}\n& =\\frac12\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n}\\color{purple}{B(n,n)}\n=\\frac12\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n}\\color{purple}{\\int_0^1 (x(1-x))^{n-1}dx} \\\\\n& = -\\frac12\\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{x(1-x)} \\color{blue}{\\left(-\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{(x(1-x))^{n}}{n}\\right)}dx\n= - \\frac12 \\int_0^1 \\frac{\\color{blue}{\\ln(1-x(1-x))}}{x(1-x)}dx \\\\\n& = -\\frac12 \\bigg(\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\ln(1-x(1-x))}{x}dx+\\underbrace{\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\ln(1-x(1-x))}{1-x}dx}_{1-x\\ \\rightarrow \\ x}\\bigg) \\\\\n& = - \\frac12\\left(\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\ln(1-x(1-x))}{x}dx +\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\ln(1-(1-x)x)}{x}dx\\right) \\\\\n& = - \\int_0^1 \\frac{\\ln(1-x+x^2)}{x}dx\n= - \\int_0^1 \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{1+x^3}{1+x}\\right)}{x}dx \\\\\n& = \\int_0^1 \\frac{\\ln(1+x)}{x}dx-\\underbrace{\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\ln(1+x^3)}{x}dx}_{x^3 \\rightarrow x} \\\\\n& = \\int_0^1 \\frac{\\ln(1+x)}{x}dx -\\frac13 \\int_0^1 \\frac{\\ln(1+x)}{x}dx\n=\\frac23\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\ln(1+x)}{x}dx\n\\end{align*} $\\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\displaystyle{\n=\\frac13 \\int_0^1 \\frac{\\ln x}{x-1}dx}$ $\\displaystyle{=-\\frac13\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\int_0^1 x^n \\ln xdx= \\frac13 \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(n+1)^2}=\\frac13 \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2}}$ As an alternative just take $x=1$ in the following relation shown by Felix Marin: $$\n\\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty}{x^{n} \\over n^{2}{2n \\choose n}}\n=-\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{\\ln(1-(1-t)tx)}{t} dt.\n$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then the problem statement follows.\n\nLooking at the original problem on Math Stack Exchange, the title is \"Show that $\\sum\\limits_{n\\ge1}\\frac1{n^2}=\\sum\\limits_{n\\ge1}\\frac3{n^2\\binom{2n}n}$ without actually evaluating both series\". The question mentions that they know both sides equal π²/6 but want a proof that doesn't rely on evaluating them to that value. The user also references approaches by Markus Scheuer and Jack D'Aurizio, and wants different methods similar to those.\n\nSo, the main problem is to prove the equality of the two series without using their known evaluation to π²/6. The assumptions here would be the conditions given in the problem. However, in the example provided, assumptions were about the properties of n. In this case, the problem is about series convergence and perhaps the properties of the binomial coefficient, but the user doesn't specify any particular constraints on n except n ≥ 1, which is already part of the summation indices. The problem doesn't state any additional conditions like convergence or specific domains, so maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond the series definitions. Wait, but the example included an assumption about n being an integer and divisible by 7, which was part of the original problem. Here, the original problem doesn't state any such conditions except n ≥ 1. However, the series are summed over n ≥ 1, so perhaps n being an integer is implicit. But the example also made explicit the assumptions. So maybe the assumption here is that n is a positive integer (since the summation is from n ≥ 1), but the problem statement as given in the question doesn't specify this—it's part of the summation notation. Should that be an assumption? The example included \"n is an integer\" even though the problem statement said \"for every integer n\". So perhaps here, since the summation is over n ≥ 1, the assumption is that n is a positive integer. So I need to list that as an assumption. But the original problem as written in the user's example didn't have that as an assumption. Wait, the example's original problem said \"for every integer n\", and in the formatted problem, the assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But here, in the current problem, the summations are over n ≥ 1, which implies n is a positive integer. So perhaps the assumption here is that n is a positive integer. However, in the problem statement given by the user, the problem is to show equality between two series, so the main assumptions are about the terms of the series. But since the problem is to prove the equality without using their evaluation to π²/6, maybe there are no specific assumptions beyond the series definitions. Wait, perhaps the key here is that the problem is to equate two series expressions, so the assumptions would be the convergence of both series, but since the user is asking for a proof of equality, maybe convergence is a given. However, in the example, the assumption was about n's properties. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe there are no specific assumptions needed here beyond the series being defined as they are, so the only assumption is that the summations are over positive integers n. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted assumption listed \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the original problem, the user didn't mention n being divisible by 7. Wait, looking back: the original example problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem had assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe there was a mistake. Wait, the user's example might have been a typo or error. Because in the original problem, if it's for every integer n, then the assumption shouldn't be that n is divisible by 7. Unless maybe the user intended to create an example where the problem had a different condition. Wait, perhaps the example was a hypothetical. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the example. But regardless, I need to follow the structure. For the current problem, the problem is to show that two series are equal without evaluating them to π²/6. The user mentions that both series equal π²/6 but wants a proof that doesn't use that fact. So the assumptions here might be that the series converge, and that n is a positive integer. Since the summations are over n ≥ 1, n is a positive integer. But does the problem require any other assumptions? The problem as stated doesn't specify any other conditions. So the assumptions would be that n is a positive integer. So in the formatted problem, under Assumption: list each assumption line by line. Here, the only assumption is that n is a positive integer (since the summation is over n ≥ 1), but wait, the problem statement as given by the user already includes \"n ≥ 1\" in the summation indices, so perhaps that's considered part of the problem statement, not an assumption. The example had the original problem stating \"for every integer n\", and the formatted assumption included \"n is an integer\". So perhaps here, the assumption is that n is a positive integer. But in the example, the original problem had a condition \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption included both \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems conflicting. Maybe the example was incorrect. But regardless, the user wants to extract assumptions from the problem. In the current problem, the problem is to show the equality of two series. The user wants this to be structured with assumptions listed. But the problem as given doesn't have any explicit assumptions beyond the series definitions. So maybe the only assumption is that the series converge. However, since the problem is to prove their equality, the convergence might be part of what needs to be established. Alternatively, the problem might assume that both series converge and are equal to each other, but that seems circular. Alternatively, maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond the series being defined as they are. Wait, but the example had \"n is an integer\" as an assumption even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n\". So perhaps the assumption here is that n is a positive integer, given the summation from n ≥ 1. So, in this case, the assumption would be that n is a positive integer. But the problem is about series, so each term in the series is defined for n ≥ 1, so n is a positive integer. Therefore, the assumption would be \"n is a positive integer\". But the problem as written in the user's input doesn't explicitly state that n is an integer; it's part of the summation notation. However, in mathematical notation, when a summation is over n ≥ 1, it's understood that n ranges over positive integers. So perhaps that is an implicit assumption. Therefore, the formatted problem's assumption would be \"n is a positive integer\". Then the problem is to show the equality of the two series. Wait, but in the example, the assumption included two conditions: \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\", even though the original problem was \"for every integer n\". That suggests that perhaps in the example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added the assumption that n is divisible by 7, which would actually narrow down the problem. That seems like a mistake. Therefore, maybe the example is not correctly formatted. However, the user provided that example, so I should follow their structure. Therefore, for the current problem, the assumptions are: n is a positive integer. Because the summation is over n ≥ 1. But the problem statement is to show the equality of the two series without evaluating them to π²/6. Therefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $$\\sum\\limits_{n\\ge1}\\frac1{n^2}=\\sum\\limits_{n\\ge1}\\frac3{n^2\\binom{2n}n}$$ without actually evaluating both series.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption was listed even though the original problem already included the conditions. So perhaps here, since the summation is over n ≥ 1, the assumption is that n is a positive integer. Hence, that's the only assumption. Therefore, the formatted problem would list that as the assumption, then the problem statement.",
