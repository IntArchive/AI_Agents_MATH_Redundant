    "Content": "Let $Y=\\{(t,t^2,t^3)\\mid t\\in k\\}$ be the twisted cubic curve. I'm trying to prove this curve is a variety, i.e., it's irreducible and affine algebraic set. The easier part is to prove the twisted cubic curve is an affine algebraic set $(Y=Z(x^2-y,x^3-z))$. I don't know how to prove that $Y$ is irreducible, I'm trying to prove that $(x^2-y,x^3-z)$ is prime, I think if I do this I proved what I want, but I found this hard to prove. I need help to finish this question. Thanks a lot.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let's first prove that ideal $I:=(x^2-y, x^3-z)$ is prime. Suppose $f\\cdot g \\in I$. Using obvious isomorphisms $k[x,y,z] \\cong (k[x,y])[z]$, $k[x,y] \\cong (k[x])[y]$ and division algorithm, we have\n$$ f(x,y,z)=(x^3-z)f_1(x,y,z) + (x^2-y)f_2(x,y) + f_3(x), $$\n$$ g(x,y,z)=(x^3-z)g_1(x,y,z) + (x^2-y)g_2(x,y) + g_3(x). $$\nNow we have $f_3(x) \\cdot g_3(x) \\in I$, therefore\n$$f_3(x) \\cdot g_3(x)=(x^3-z)h_1(x,y,z) + (x^2-y)h_2(x,y,z).$$\nInsert $(x,y,z)=(t,t^2,t^3)$ and get $f_3(t) \\cdot g_3(t) =0$ for all $t \\in k$. If $k$ is algebraically closed (therefore infinite), we have $f_3 \\cdot g_3 = 0$, so $f_3 = 0$ or $g_3= 0$. Then $f \\in I$ of $g \\in I$, so $I$ is prime (and therefore radical).\nWe have $I(Y)=I(V(I)) = \\operatorname{Rad}(I) = I$, which is prime. So $Y$ is irreducible.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants to prove that the twisted cubic curve Y is an affine variety, which requires showing it's both an affine algebraic set and irreducible. They mentioned that proving Y is an affine algebraic set is straightforward by showing Y equals the zero set Z(x² - y, x³ - z). The main difficulty is proving irreducibility, which they think can be done by showing the ideal (x² - y, x³ - z) is prime. \n\nFirst, I need to recall that an affine algebraic set is irreducible if its coordinate ring is an integral domain. The coordinate ring here would be k[x,y,z]/(x² - y, x³ - z). If that quotient ring is an integral domain, then the ideal (x² - y, x³ - z) must be prime, hence Y is irreducible.\n\nSo the key step is showing that the ideal generated by x² - y and x³ - z is prime. One way to approach this is by showing that the quotient ring has no zero divisors. Alternatively, maybe we can find a parameterization or isomorphism that makes it clearer. Since Y is defined parametrically as (t, t², t³), there's a natural map from the polynomial ring k[x,y,z] to k[t] sending x ↦ t, y ↦ t², z ↦ t³. The kernel of this map should be the ideal (x² - y, x³ - z), right? Because any polynomial in x,y,z that vanishes on Y must satisfy y = x² and z = x³. \n\nIf that's the case, then the coordinate ring k[x,y,z]/(x² - y, x³ - z) is isomorphic to k[t], which is an integral domain because k[t] is a polynomial ring over a field. Therefore, since the coordinate ring is an integral domain, the ideal is prime, and thus Y is irreducible. \n\nWait, but I need to make sure that the kernel is indeed generated by those two polynomials. Suppose we have a polynomial f(x,y,z) that maps to zero under the substitution y = x², z = x³. Then f(x, x², x³) = 0. To show that f is in (x² - y, x³ - z), we can use the fact that we can replace y with x² and z with x³ in f, so any such f can be written as a combination of x² - y and x³ - z. That might require using the division algorithm or some substitution argument. Alternatively, since the map k[x,y,z] → k[t] is surjective (since t is in the image), the kernel is the ideal defining Y, which we already said is (x² - y, x³ - z). Therefore, the coordinate ring is isomorphic to k[t], which is an integral domain. Hence, the ideal is prime, so Y is irreducible.\n\nTherefore, the main assumptions here are about the structure of Y as the image of this parameterization and the properties of the ideal generated by those two polynomials. The problem is to prove Y is irreducible, which hinges on showing the ideal is prime, leading to the coordinate ring being an integral domain.",
