    "Content": "Let $p$ be a polynomial of degree $n$ such that $|p(z)| = 1$ for all $|z| = 1$. Why is it that $p(z) = az^n$ for some $|a| = 1$? I've noticed that we could easily prove this by induction if we could show that 0 was a root of $p$. My guess is that Rouche's theorem and/or the Maximum Modulus principle should be used. My background to the problem: This question is the last question on the take-home portion of my final exam that I haven't been able to figure out yet. We are allowed to collaborate with other people in the class (and I have) as well as use any book and the internet (including this site). So basically, it's a homework assignment that is worth more points than usual. Nevertheless, in case it helps you decide how much information to give, the final is due tomorrow (but since I'm going to a math conference, I may turn it in late).",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If $p$ has no zeros in the unit disk, then $p$ must be constant - consider $\\frac{1}{p}$. So for $n > 0$, $p$ must have zeros in the unit disk. Let them be $0 = \\zeta_0, \\zeta_1,\\dotsc,\\zeta_k$, with multiplicities $\\mu_0,\\dotsc,\\mu_k$, where we allow $\\mu_0 = 0$, but demand $\\mu_\\kappa > 0$ for $1 \\leqslant \\kappa \\leqslant k$. Consider $$f(z) = z^{\\mu_0} \\prod_{\\kappa = 1}^k \\left(\\frac{z-\\zeta_\\kappa}{1-\\overline{\\zeta_\\kappa}\\cdot z}\\right)^{\\mu_\\kappa}.$$ $f$ is holomorphic in a neighbourhood of the closed unit disk, and $f$ has the same zeros (including multiplicity) in the unit disk as $p$. Hence $$g(z) = \\frac{f(z)}{p(z)}$$ is holomorphic in a neighbourhood of the closed unit disk and has no zeros in the unit disk. For $\\lvert z\\rvert = 1$, you can say something about $g(z)$ that implies that $g$ is constant. And that implies that $k = 0$ and $\\mu_0 = n$. Alternatively, consider the entire meromorphic function $$h(z) = \\frac{1}{\\overline{p(1/\\overline{z})}}.$$ Use the conditions on $p$ to deduce $p = h$, and from that the result.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. So the question is about a polynomial p of degree n such that the absolute value of p(z) is 1 for all z on the unit circle (|z| = 1). We need to show that p(z) must be a monomial of the form az^n where |a| = 1. \n\nFirst, I remember that polynomials with absolute value 1 on the unit circle have some special properties. Maybe something related to Blaschke products? But wait, Blaschke products are usually rational functions, not polynomials. Hmm. Alternatively, maximum modulus principle could be useful here. Since |p(z)| = 1 on the unit circle, inside the unit disk, by maximum modulus, the maximum of |p(z)| would be attained on the boundary. But if the polynomial has degree n, maybe considering the reciprocal polynomial could help.\n\nWait, there's a trick where if you have a polynomial p(z) of degree n with all roots inside the unit disk, then the reciprocal polynomial q(z) = z^n p(1/z̄)* (conjugate reciprocal) would have roots outside the unit disk. But here, p(z) has |p(z)| = 1 on |z|=1. So maybe p(z) times its reciprocal gives something? Let me think. If |z|=1, then 1/z̄ = z. So on |z|=1, we have |p(z)| = 1, so p(z) times its reciprocal would be p(z) * z^n p(1/z̄)* = |p(z)|^2 = 1. But since p(z) is a polynomial, z^n p(1/z̄)* is a polynomial only if p(0) ≠ 0. Wait, maybe not. If p(z) has a zero at 0, then the reciprocal would have a pole. But since we are dealing with polynomials, perhaps p(z) can't have any zeros inside the unit disk?\n\nAlternatively, if |p(z)| = 1 on |z|=1, then consider q(z) = z^n p(1/z̄)*. Then on |z|=1, q(z) = z^n p(z)*. Then p(z) q(z) = z^n |p(z)|^2 = z^n. But since |p(z)|=1, this implies p(z) q(z) = z^n. But p(z) and q(z) are both polynomials. So p(z) must divide z^n. But since p(z) is a polynomial of degree n, this implies that p(z) is a monomial times z^n. Wait, but z^n divided by p(z) would need to be a polynomial. If p(z) is of degree n and divides z^n, then p(z) must be a monomial, right? Because the only divisors of z^n are monomials of the form a z^k for k ≤ n. But since p(z) has degree n, it must be a z^n. Then the condition that |p(z)|=1 on |z|=1 would require |a z^n|=|a|=1, so |a|=1. Hence p(z)=a z^n with |a|=1. That seems to work.\n\nBut let me check if this reasoning is correct. Let's formalize it. Let p(z) be a polynomial of degree n with |p(z)|=1 for |z|=1. Define q(z) = z^n p(1/z̄)*. But since |z|=1, 1/z̄ = z, so q(z) = z^n p(z)*. Then the product p(z) q(z) = p(z) z^n p(z)* = z^n |p(z)|^2 = z^n *1 = z^n. But p(z) q(z) is a polynomial of degree n + n = 2n, but here it's equal to z^n. Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, no, p(z) is degree n, so q(z) is also degree n? Let's see. If p(z) is of degree n, then p(1/z̄)* would have terms up to z^{-n}, and multiplying by z^n gives a polynomial of degree n. So yes, q(z) is a polynomial of degree n.\n\nBut then the product p(z) q(z) is z^n. But the product of two degree n polynomials is degree 2n, but z^n is degree n. That can only happen if all the coefficients of the product beyond z^n are zero. Which would require that the product p(z) q(z) has only the term z^n. That implies that when you multiply p(z) and q(z), all coefficients except for the z^n term cancel out. But how can that happen?\n\nWait, perhaps p(z) must be a monomial. If p(z) is a z^n, then q(z) would be z^n (a z^{-n})* = z^n (a* z^{-n}) ) = a* z^0 = a*. So then p(z) q(z) = a z^n * a* = |a|^2 z^n. If |a|=1, then this is z^n. So that works. So in this case, if p(z) is a monomial, then the product is z^n. Conversely, if the product p(z) q(z) = z^n, then p(z) must divide z^n. Since p(z) is a polynomial of degree n, the only divisors of z^n of degree n are monomials of the form a z^n. Therefore, p(z) must be a monomial, and then |a|=1 because |p(z)|=1 on |z|=1. Hence, p(z)=a z^n with |a|=1.\n\nTherefore, the key idea is to use the reciprocal polynomial and analyze the product. This approach uses the maximum modulus principle indirectly by leveraging the condition on the unit circle. Also, note that if p had any other roots besides zero, they would have to be canceled out by the reciprocal polynomial, but since the product is z^n, all roots must be at the origin. Hence, p(z) must be a monomial.\n\nAnother approach could be using the Maximum Modulus Principle. Suppose p(z) is a polynomial of degree n with |p(z)|=1 on |z|=1. Consider the function f(z) = p(z)/z^n. Then on |z|=1, |f(z)| = |p(z)| / |z|^n = 1 / 1 = 1. So |f(z)|=1 on the unit circle. If f(z) is analytic inside the unit disk (since p(z) is a polynomial, z^n is analytic except at z=0, but since p(z) is a polynomial, if p(z) has a zero at z=0 of order k, then f(z) = p(z)/z^n would have a pole of order n - k at z=0. Unless k = n, in which case f(z) is a constant. Therefore, unless p(z) is a multiple of z^n, f(z) would have a pole at 0. But by the Maximum Modulus Principle, if f(z) is analytic in the closed unit disk (i.e., no poles), then |f(z)| attains its maximum on the boundary. But |f(z)|=1 on the boundary, so if f(z) is analytic, then |f(z)| ≤ 1 inside, and similarly, by considering 1/f(z), if f(z) has no zeros, then |f(z)| ≥1 inside. Hence, |f(z)|=1 everywhere, so f(z) is a constant of modulus 1. Thus, p(z) = a z^n with |a|=1. However, if p(z) is not a multiple of z^n, then f(z) would have a pole inside the unit disk, contradicting the analyticity required for the Maximum Modulus Principle. Therefore, p(z) must be a monomial.\n\nTherefore, both approaches lead to the conclusion that p(z) must be a monomial of the form a z^n with |a|=1. The key assumptions are that p is a polynomial of degree n and that |p(z)|=1 for all |z|=1. No additional conditions like p having a root at 0 are necessary, but rather the given conditions force p to have all roots at 0 (i.e., be a monomial).",
