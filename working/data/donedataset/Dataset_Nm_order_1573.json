    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $a_n =\\displaystyle  \\frac{2^n n!}{n^n}.$ Note that $a_6 = 80/81 < 1.$ We also have $$ \\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} = \\frac{2^{n+1} (n+1)! }{(n+1)^{n+1}} \\cdot \\frac{n^n}{2^n n!} = 2 \\left(\\frac{n}{n+1}\\right)^n < 1.$$ The sequence $$x_n = \\left(1- \\frac{1}{n+1} \\right)^n$$ is monotonically decreasing to $1/e.$ Since $e>2$, $a_{n+1}/a_n < 1$ so $(a_n)$ is a monotonically decreasing sequence. Thus the first inequality holds. By considering Taylor series, $\\displaystyle e^x \\geq \\frac{x^n}{n!}$ for all $x\\geq 0,$ and $n\\in \\mathbb{N}.$ In particular, for $x=n$ this yields $$ n! \\geq \\left( \\frac{n}{e} \\right)^n $$ and this is stronger than the second inequality. We could have used the same proof method for the second inequality as we did for the first: Let $b_n= \\displaystyle  \\frac{3^n n!}{n^n}.$ Then $b_6 = 45/4 > 1.$ Also, $$ \\frac{b_{n+1}}{b_n} = \\frac{3^{n+1} (n+1)! }{(n+1)^{n+1}} \\cdot \\frac{n^n}{3^n n!} = 3 \\left(\\frac{n}{n+1}\\right)^n $$ and this is greater than $1$ since $e<3.$ What we have just done suggests we can prove the following: If $a,b$ are positive real numbers such that $a<e<b$ then $$ \\left(\\frac{n}{a} \\right)^n > n! > \\left( \\frac{n}{b} \\right)^n $$ holds for sufficiently large $n$. This is turn suggests something stronger about the growth of the factorial function: $n!$ is asymptotically equal to $(n/e)^n$ to within at most a sub-exponential factor.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me start by understanding the original question. The user wants to prove the inequality (n/2)^n > n! > (n/3)^n without using mathematical induction. \n\nFirst, I should list the assumptions. The problem mentions that this inequality holds, but the user hasn't specified any conditions on n. However, in the example provided, assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, factorials are defined for non-negative integers, so n must be a non-negative integer. But the inequalities might not hold for all n. Let me check for small values.\n\nWhen n=1: (1/2)^1 = 0.5 > 1! =1? No, 0.5 <1, so the left inequality fails. Similarly, for n=2: (2/2)^2 =1 > 2! =2? No, 1 <2. Left inequality fails again. For n=3: (3/2)^3 =3.375 vs 6. So still 3.375 <6. Hmm. Maybe n needs to be larger. Let's check n=4: (4/2)^4=16 vs 24. 16 <24. Still not. n=5: (5/2)^5=3125/32≈97.66 vs 120. Still 97.66 <120. Wait, when does (n/2)^n become larger than n! ?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the inequality is for sufficiently large n. But the problem statement doesn't specify. However, in the original question title, it's written as (n/2)^n >n! >(n/3)^n. The user might have encountered this inequality and is asking for a proof without induction. But I need to figure out the correct assumptions.\n\nWait, perhaps the inequality holds for n ≥6 or something. Let me check n=6: (6/2)^6=729 vs 720. 729>720. So left inequality holds. For n=6, right side: (6/3)^6=64 vs 720. 64 <720. So for n=6, both inequalities hold. n=5: (5/3)^5≈40.4 vs 120. Still holds on the right. But left inequality fails for n=5. So perhaps the left inequality holds for n ≥6, while the right holds for n ≥1?\n\nWait, for n=1, right inequality: (1/3)^1≈0.333 <1! =1. Yes. For n=2: (2/3)^2≈0.444 <2. For n=3:1 <6. So right inequality holds for n≥1. Left inequality: Starting from n=6, (n/2)^n >n!.\n\nBut the original problem statement in the title says \"Prove that (n/2)^n >n! > (n/3)^n\". So perhaps the user assumes that n is sufficiently large, but maybe the problem as stated doesn't specify. However, to structure the problem correctly, we need to list the assumptions. Since the original problem didn't specify, but the example had assumptions, perhaps in this case, the assumptions are that n is a positive integer, but maybe n ≥6 for the left inequality and n ≥1 for the right. However, the problem might not state that, so maybe the user missed specifying the domain. But as per the user's question, they just present the inequality as given. \n\nWait, in the original problem statement, the user writes: \"Prove \\[ \\left(\\frac n2\\right)^n > n! > \\left(\\frac n3\\right)^n \\] without using induction\". The user might have forgotten to mention the range of n, but since factorials are for integers ≥0, but for n=0, 0! =1, and (0/2)^0 is undefined. So n should be a positive integer. But the inequality might not hold for all positive integers. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions are that n is a positive integer and n ≥6? But how can we know? The problem as stated by the user does not specify, but in the example, the assumption was n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, maybe the user assumes n is a positive integer, but we have to check for which n the inequality holds. However, since the user is asking to prove it without induction, perhaps the original problem assumes n is sufficiently large, but since in their example, the assumptions were explicit, here the problem might not have stated any, but in reality, the inequality holds for n≥6. However, the user's problem statement does not mention that. So perhaps the correct approach is to note that the problem as stated by the user may require additional assumptions. However, since the user hasn't provided them, perhaps the formatted problem should list the necessary assumptions. But since the user's example extracted assumptions from the problem (the original problem in the example had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\"), which was perhaps a mistake. Wait, no: in the example, the original problem was \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, the original problem said \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n)... is divisible by 91.\" Then in the formatted problem, the assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". So maybe the user made a mistake in the example? Because 91 is 7*13, so perhaps the problem actually requires n to be divisible by both 7 and 13? Or maybe the original problem in the example was different. But regardless, following the user's instructions, the task is to filter the original problem's assumptions and structure them line by line. \n\nIn the current problem, the user's original question is \"Prove that (n/2)^n >n! > (n/3)^n without using induction\". The user's question does not specify the domain of n, but since factorials are defined for non-negative integers, but the inequalities need to hold. However, as we saw, the left inequality (n/2)^n >n! holds only for n≥6. The right inequality holds for n≥1. Therefore, the correct assumption would be that n is an integer and n≥6. However, the user's problem statement does not specify this. Therefore, perhaps the problem as posed is incorrect, but the formatted version should list assumptions that make the problem true. Alternatively, if the problem is as stated by the user, but the user missed stating the assumptions, we need to infer them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is from a source where it's given for n≥2 or something else. But without more context, we have to rely on mathematical correctness. Therefore, the assumptions should be that n is an integer greater than or equal to 6. But the original problem statement doesn't state that. So perhaps the formatted problem should list the assumptions as n being a positive integer and n ≥6. But the user's original question does not mention this, so perhaps the formatted problem should just state n is a positive integer, but that's not sufficient. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the problem statement, and the correct inequalities are reversed or have different bounds. But given the user's question, I have to work with what's presented. So, to structure the problem correctly, the assumptions should be:\n\n- n is a positive integer\n- n ≥6\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't mention n≥6. However, since the inequalities don't hold for n<6, the problem as stated is incorrect unless those assumptions are made. Therefore, to make the problem correct, the assumptions must include n≥6. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nn is greater than or equal to 6.\n\nProblem:\nProve that \\[ \\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right)^n > n! > \\left(\\frac{n}{3}\\right)^n \\]\n\nBut the user's original problem does not specify n≥6, but mathematically, the inequality only holds for n≥6. Therefore, the formatted problem must include that assumption. Otherwise, the problem is false. Therefore, I should list those assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is from a source where it's intended for all n≥1, but that's not true. So the correct approach is to include the necessary assumptions to make the problem statement true. Hence, the formatted problem would have assumptions that n is a positive integer and n≥6. Then the problem is to prove the inequalities. Therefore, that's how I should structure it.",
