    "Content": "Inspired by a recent question on the nilradical of an absolutely flat ring, what are some of your favourite applications of the Nakayama Lemma? It would be good if you outlined a proof for the result too. I am also interested to see the Nakayama Lemma prove some facts in Algebraic Geometry if possible. Here are some facts which one can use the Nakayama lemma to prove. A local ring that is absolutely flat is a field - proof given here . Every set of $n$  - generators for a free module of rank $n$ is a basis - proof given here . For any integral domain $R$ (that is not a field) with fraction field $F$, it is never the case that $F$ is a f.g. $R$ - module. Sketch proof: if $F$ is f.g. as a $R$ - module then certainly it is f.g. as a $R_{\\mathfrak{m}}$ module for any maximal ideal $\\mathfrak{m}$. Then $\\mathfrak{m}_{\\mathfrak{m}}F = F$ and so Nakayama's Lemma implies $F = 0$ which is ridiculous.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $A$ be a commutative ring and $M$ a finitely generated $A$-module.    Then every surjective endomorphism $f:M\\to M$ is injective . This result (due to Vasconcelos) surprizingly holds in complete generality, without any noetherianness assumption, and crucially uses Nakayama in its proof: The trick is to consider  $M$  also as an $A[X]$-module via the multiplication $P(X)\\cdot m=P(f)(m)$, so that for example $(X^3-X)\\cdot m=f^3(m)-f(m)$. The surjectivity asssumption translates into $M=IM$, where $I$ is the ideal $I=(X)\\subset A[X]$. Nakayama then says that for some $i=Q(X)X\\in I$ we have $m=i\\cdot m$ for all $m\\in M$. [Needless to say, since $M$  is finitely generated over $A$, it is a fortiori finitely generated over $A[X]$ so that Nakayama may legitimately be invoked.] And now the injectivity of $f$ follows: if $f(m)=0$ we have successively $$m=i\\cdot m=Q(X)X\\cdot m=Q(f)(f(m))=Q(f)(0)=0$$ so that $m=0$, which proves the injectivity of $f$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to help structure this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me read through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe title is \"Favourite applications of the Nakayama Lemma,\" and the user is asking for people's favorite applications, possibly including proofs and mentions of algebraic geometry. They provided some examples:\n\n1. A local ring that is absolutely flat is a field.\n2. Every set of n generators for a free module of rank n is a basis.\n3. For any integral domain R (not a field) with fraction field F, F is not a finitely generated R-module.\n\nThey also included a sketch proof for the third example using Nakayama's Lemma.\n\nNow, the task is to extract the assumptions and the problem from this. The example given in the original question shows that the problem was about proving divisibility by 91 with certain assumptions. Here, the user is asking for applications of Nakayama's Lemma, but how to structure this?\n\nWait, the user wants the problem to be formatted into Assumption and Problem sections. But in the given example, the original problem had an assumption (n is an integer, divisible by 7) and the problem to prove something. So here, the Math Stack Exchange question is more of a list of problems, each of which can be structured as separate problems with their own assumptions. But the user hasn't specified which specific problem to format. The original question is a general request for favorite applications, but the user provided three examples. Maybe each example is a separate problem?\n\nLooking at the example given by the user, they took a specific problem (prove A(n) divisible by 91) and listed assumptions. So perhaps for each of the three examples in the question, we need to structure them as separate problems with their own assumptions.\n\nBut the original question isn't asking to solve these examples; it's asking for favorite applications. However, the user's instruction is to \"structure that problem as the following format\" based on the example. The example took a problem and listed its assumptions, then the problem statement. The user wants me to read the Math SE question, filter unrelated info, and structure the problem as per the format.\n\nWait, the original problem in the example was a specific math problem. Here, the Math SE question is a request for applications of Nakayama's Lemma, but the user provided three specific applications as examples. So maybe each of these applications can be considered as separate problems. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted problem listed the assumptions (n is integer, divisible by 7) and the problem statement. But in the current case, the user's problem is a question asking for applications of Nakayama's Lemma, with three examples. However, the task is to structure the problem in the given format. Perhaps each of these examples is a separate problem that can be structured.\n\nBut the user's instruction says: \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filter the unrelated information, and structure that problem as the following format.\" The question here is \"What are your favorite applications of Nakayama Lemma?\" with some examples. But the user probably wants to take one of the specific problems mentioned in the question and format it. For example, the third example given by the user: proving that the fraction field F of an integral domain R (not a field) is not finitely generated as an R-module.\n\nSo perhaps pick that specific problem and structure it. Let's check the original problem's example. The user had a problem statement and then formatted assumptions and problem. So maybe take the third example and structure it.\n\nThe third example: For any integral domain R (that is not a field) with fraction field F, F is not a finitely generated R-module. The sketch proof uses Nakayama's Lemma. So the problem here is to prove that F is not finitely generated as an R-module. The assumptions would be:\n\n- R is an integral domain.\n- R is not a field.\n- F is the fraction field of R.\n- F is considered as an R-module.\n\nWait, in the example given by the user, the assumptions were about the variable n (integer, divisible by 7). Here, the assumptions would be about R and F. So each assumption should be a single property applied to one object. Let me list them:\n\nAssumption:\nR is an integral domain,\nR is not a field,\nF is the fraction field of R,\nF is a finitely generated R-module.\n\nWait, but the problem is to prove that F is NOT finitely generated. So in the problem statement, we need to say \"Prove that F is not a finitely generated R-module.\" But the assumptions would include the conditions on R. The original sketch proof says: if F is finitely generated as an R-module, then it is finitely generated as an R_m module for any maximal ideal m. Then m_m F = F, so by Nakayama, F=0, which is a contradiction.\n\nBut in the problem statement, we have to state the problem and the assumptions. So the problem is \"Prove that F is not a finitely generated R-module.\" The assumptions would be:\n\n- R is an integral domain.\n- R is not a field.\n- F is the fraction field of R.\n\nBut in the example given by the user, the assumption included the divisibility condition on n. Similarly here, the assumptions would be the properties of R and F. The fact that F is a finitely generated R-module is part of the hypothesis for contradiction, but in the problem statement, we are to show that this cannot happen. So the problem is to prove that under the assumptions that R is an integral domain not a field with fraction field F, then F is not finitely generated as an R-module. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nR is an integral domain,\nR is not a field,\nF is the fraction field of R.\n\nProblem:\nProve that F is not a finitely generated R-module.\n\nThat seems correct. Each assumption is a single property applied to one object. R is an integral domain, R is not a field, F is the fraction field of R. Then the problem is to prove F is not finitely generated as an R-module.\n\nThe other examples in the question can be structured similarly. For example, the first one: A local ring that is absolutely flat is a field. So assumptions would be:\n\n- R is a local ring,\n- R is absolutely flat.\n\nProblem: Prove that R is a field.\n\nSimilarly, the second example: Every set of n generators for a free module of rank n is a basis. Assumptions:\n\n- M is a free module of rank n,\n- S is a set of n generators for M.\n\nProblem: Prove that S is a basis for M.\n\nBut the user's original question includes all three examples, but the task is to structure the problem. Since the user's example had one problem, perhaps the answer should focus on one of the examples provided. The user's original example in the problem was a single problem, so perhaps the answer here should pick one of the three examples and format it. The user might want all three, but the example only formatted one. Let me check the original instructions: \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" So the entire question on Math SE is the input, and the output is a structured problem in the given format. But the Math SE question is a request for applications of Nakayama's Lemma, with three examples. However, the task is to structure the problem, so maybe the main problem is to answer the original question (asking for applications), but the examples given are sub-problems. But in the example provided by the user, the formatted problem was a specific problem with assumptions. So perhaps each of the three examples in the Math SE question should be structured as separate problems. However, the user's instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format,\" implying that each problem should be formatted separately. Therefore, perhaps the answer should list each of the three examples as separate problems.\n\nBut the user's example only formatted one problem. Given the ambiguity, perhaps focusing on one example would suffice. Given that the third example has a more detailed sketch proof, perhaps that one.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nR is an integral domain,\nR is not a field,\nF is the fraction field of R.\nProblem:\nProve that F is not a finitely generated R-module.\n\nAlternatively, if considering the proof sketch, the assumption that F is finitely generated is part of the contradiction hypothesis, but the problem is to show that F cannot be finitely generated. Therefore, the problem's assumptions are the conditions on R and F.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the assumptions are the properties of R and F, and the problem is to prove that F is not finitely generated as an R-module.",
