    "Content": "I was experimenting with products of the form $$\\prod_{k=1}^{n} \\left( a + b\\cos(ck) \\right)$$ when I found that the expression $$\\prod_{k=1}^{n} \\left( 3 + 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{n+1}k\\right) \\right)$$ seems to always return a perfect square. (verified numerically). $$\\left(3 + 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{2}\\right)\\right) = 1 = F_2^2$$ $$\\left(3 + 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right)\\right) \\left(3 + 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{4\\pi}{3}\\right)\\right) = 4 = F_3^2$$ $$\\left(3 + 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{4}\\right)\\right)\\left(3 + 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{4\\pi}{4}\\right)\\right) \\left(3 + 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{6\\pi}{4}\\right)\\right) = 9 = F_4^2$$ $$\\dots$$ Furthermore, it appears these squares are the squares of Fibonacci numbers. ( $F_1 = F_2 = 1$ , $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2})$ I've tried to prove that this expression always gives a perfect square by considering the identity (Cassini's identity) $$F_{n}^2 = F_{n+1}F_{n-1} + (-1)^{n-1}$$ and using induction to show that the above product satisfies this relation, and since the base cases ( $F_1, F_2...$ ) are that of the Fibonacci sequence then this would prove that the expression is the square of Fibonacci numbers. However, this approach led nowhere. Is there a clever way to show that the above expression is related to Fibonacci numbers?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Changing notation slightly (my $n$ is your $n + 1,$ and my $F_n$ is your $F_{n + 1},$ if that's not too confusing a way to put it!), let $\\omega$ be a primitive $n$ th root of unity. Then $$\n\\sqrt{5}F_n = \\varphi^n - \\frac{(-1)^n}{\\varphi^n} = \\frac{(\\varphi^2)^n - (-1)^n}{\\varphi^n} = \\prod_{k=0}^{n-1}\\frac{\\varphi^2 + \\omega^k}{\\varphi} = \\prod_{k=0}^{n-1}\\left(\\varphi + \\frac{\\omega^k}{\\varphi}\\right),\n$$ therefore $$\n5F_n^2 = \\prod_{k=0}^{n-1}\\left(\\varphi + \\frac{\\omega^k}{\\varphi}\\right)\\left(\\varphi + \\frac{\\omega^{-k}}{\\varphi}\\right) = \\prod_{k=0}^{n-1}\\left(\\varphi^2 + \\frac1{\\varphi^2} + 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi k}{n}\\right)\\right).\n$$ But $$\n\\varphi^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt5 + 1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{3 + \\sqrt5}{2}, \\quad \\therefore \\ \\frac1{\\varphi^2} = \\frac{3 - \\sqrt5}{2}, \\quad \\therefore \\ \\varphi^2 + \\frac1{\\varphi^2} = 3.\n$$ Cancelling out the factor for $k = 0,$ which is equal to $5,$ we get: $$\nF_n^2 = \\prod_{k=1}^{n-1}\\left(3 + 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi k}{n}\\right)\\right).\n$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user is asking about a product involving cosines and wants to show it's the square of a Fibonacci number. First, I need to parse the original question and extract the key assumptions and the main problem statement.\n\nThe original question mentions that the product ∏ from k=1 to n of (3 + 2cos(2πk/(n+1))) results in a perfect square, specifically the square of a Fibonacci number. They provided examples for n=1,2,3 where the product equals 1, 4, 9, which are F₂², F₃², F₄² respectively. The problem is to prove this in general.\n\nNow, structuring this into the required format. The assumptions should list each condition or property applied to one object. Let's see:\n\nFirst, the product runs from k=1 to n. Each term in the product is 3 + 2cos(2πk/(n+1)). The problem states that this product is a perfect square of a Fibonacci number. The Fibonacci sequence is defined here with F₁=F₂=1 and Fₙ=Fₙ₋₁ + Fₙ₋₂.\n\nSo the assumptions would include the structure of the product, the specific cosine argument, and the definition of Fibonacci numbers. Each assumption should be a single line, one property per line.\n\nWait, but in the example given by the user, they listed assumptions like \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". Here, the assumptions would be about the product's terms, the range of k, the coefficients in the cosine terms, and the Fibonacci definition.\n\nBut need to check if there are any hidden conditions. The problem says \"for n\" but the examples start with n=1 (product has 1 term) leading to F₂². So perhaps the index shift here: n in the product corresponds to F_{n+1}²? Wait, in the examples, when n=1, product is 1 which is F₂². When n=2, product is 4=F₃², n=3 gives 9=F₄². So the product for general n is F_{n+1}². But the problem statement says \"the square of a Fibonacci number\", not necessarily specifying which one, but the examples indicate it's F_{n+1}².\n\nBut the original problem's title says \"the square of a Fibonacci number\", but the examples show F_2, F_3, F_4 squared. So the assumption would be that the product equals F_{n+1}². Wait, but the user didn't specify that explicitly; they observed it empirically. So perhaps the problem is to show that the product is the square of a Fibonacci number, and from the examples, it's F_{n+1}².\n\nSo, the problem is to prove that the given product equals the square of the (n+1)-th Fibonacci number. However, the problem statement in the original question just says \"the square of a Fibonacci number\", but the examples suggest it's specifically F_{n+1}². So maybe that's an implicit assumption? Or maybe the problem is to show it's a square of some Fibonacci number, not necessarily F_{n+1}. But given the examples, the user probably wants to connect it to F_{n+1}².\n\nBut in the formatted problem, the assumptions should list all given conditions. Let's check the original problem:\n\nOriginal problem states:\n\n\"Showing that ∏_{k=1}^{n} (3 + 2cos(2πk/(n+1))) is the square of a Fibonacci number\"\n\nQuestion elaborates that the product seems to be a perfect square, and those squares are squares of Fibonacci numbers, with examples F₂², F₃², F₄². So the problem is to prove that the product is equal to F_{n+1}².\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would include:\n\n- The product is taken from k=1 to n.\n\n- Each term in the product is 3 + 2cos(2πk/(n+1)).\n\n- Fibonacci numbers are defined with F₁ = F₂ = 1, and Fₙ = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} for n ≥ 3.\n\nBut wait, the problem might not require assuming the Fibonacci definition, but in the example given by the user, they included \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem didn't state that. Wait, looking back at the example:\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, but the original problem didn't say n is divisible by 7. The user added that as an assumption? Hmm, maybe I need to check that example again.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions list \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But that seems contradictory because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", which would not require n to be divisible by 7. However, the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That suggests that the user may have modified the problem, perhaps as part of their own solution, but in the given example, there's a mistake. Wait, perhaps that example was a different problem. Wait, maybe the original problem in the example had a different condition. Let me recheck:\n\nThe example's original problem says: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem's assumptions list n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But 91 is 7*13, so maybe the user meant that the divisibility by 91 holds when n is divisible by 7, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\". That seems conflicting. Perhaps the example is incorrect, but I need to focus on the current problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's original question states that the product is a perfect square and that the squares are of Fibonacci numbers, as per the examples. So, the assumptions to list would be:\n\n- The product is over k from 1 to n.\n\n- Each term in the product is 3 + 2cos(2πk/(n+1)).\n\n- The Fibonacci sequence is defined with F₁ = F₂ = 1 and Fₙ = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} for n ≥ 3.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that the product equals F_{n+1}². Wait, but in the problem statement as given, the user didn't specify the index of the Fibonacci number. They just say \"the square of a Fibonacci number\". However, based on the examples, it's F_{n+1}². So maybe the problem should be phrased as proving that the product is the square of the (n+1)-th Fibonacci number. But since the problem's title and question state it's the square of a Fibonacci number, and the examples show F_{n+1}², perhaps we need to make that explicit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to show that the product is a perfect square, specifically the square of a Fibonacci number, but the exact index might need to be inferred. However, in the problem statement, the user mentions that the squares are of Fibonacci numbers, so perhaps the key is to link the product to the square of a Fibonacci number, which from examples is F_{n+1}².\n\nSo, the assumptions would be:\n\n- For each k from 1 to n, the term is 3 + 2cos(2πk/(n+1)).\n\n- The product is taken over k=1 to n.\n\n- The Fibonacci sequence is defined by F₁ = 1, F₂ = 1, and Fₙ = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} for n ≥ 3.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that this product equals the square of a Fibonacci number (specifically F_{n+1}²). However, the problem statement in the original question doesn't explicitly state that the product equals F_{n+1}², but the examples do. So perhaps the problem is as per the title: the product is the square of a Fibonacci number, and the user is seeking a proof. Therefore, the formatted problem should capture that.\n\nSo, putting this all together:\n\nAssumption: The product is taken over k from 1 to n.\n\nAssumption: Each term in the product is 3 + 2cos(2πk/(n+1)).\n\nAssumption: The Fibonacci sequence is defined by F₁ = 1, F₂ = 1, and Fₙ = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} for n ≥ 3.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$\\prod_{k=1}^{n} \\left( 3 + 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi k}{n+1}\\right) \\right)$$ is the square of a Fibonacci number.\n\nBut wait, the original problem's title says it's the square of a Fibonacci number, and the examples show F_{n+1}². However, the user might not have explicitly stated that it's F_{n+1}² in the problem statement; they observed it numerically. Therefore, the problem is to prove that the product is the square of a Fibonacci number (without specifying which one), but the answer would likely need to show it's F_{n+1}².\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem should specify that it's F_{n+1}² based on the examples. However, since the original problem statement doesn't explicitly state that, only the examples imply it, perhaps the formatted problem should just say \"is the square of a Fibonacci number\".\n\nAlternatively, if we follow the example where the user included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (like n divisible by 7), maybe here we need to infer that n is a positive integer, etc.\n\nWait, the original problem's examples start with n=1,2,3, so n is a positive integer. So perhaps adding \"n is a positive integer\" as an assumption.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n\n- The product is taken over k from 1 to n.\n\n- Each term in the product is 3 + 2cos(2πk/(n+1)).\n\n- The Fibonacci sequence is defined by F₁ = 1, F₂ = 1, and Fₙ = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} for n ≥ 3.\n\nProblem: Prove that the product is the square of a Fibonacci number.\n\nBut in the example provided by the user, the assumptions included conditions that were not all in the original problem, but maybe filtered out unrelated info. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", which was not in the original. That seems like a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the user made an error in their example. That complicates things, but perhaps we should focus on the current problem.\n\nGiven that, the key assumptions here are:\n\n1. n is a positive integer.\n\n2. For each integer k where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, the term is 3 + 2cos(2πk/(n+1)).\n\n3. Fibonacci numbers are defined with F₁ = F₂ = 1 and Fₙ = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} for n ≥ 3.\n\nThe problem is to show that the product of these terms is the square of a Fibonacci number, specifically F_{n+1}², but since the original problem doesn't explicitly state the index, the problem statement should reflect that as per the user's question.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nEach term in the product is $3 + 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi k}{n+1}\\right)$ for $k = 1, 2, \\ldots, n$,\nThe Fibonacci sequence is defined by $F_1 = 1$, $F_2 = 1$, and $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$ for $n \\geq 3$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\prod_{k=1}^{n} \\left( 3 + 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi k}{n+1}\\right) \\right)$$ is the square of a Fibonacci number.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement in the original question says \"is the square of a Fibonacci number\", so the formatted problem should state that. The examples indicate it's F_{n+1}², but the problem as asked is to show it's a square of some Fibonacci number. Hence, the problem remains as stated.",
