    "Content": "I am gathering material for an exposition on Lie theory and I am after proofs that a Lie group with finite centre is compact if and only if its Killing form is negative definite. I know of one, sketched as follows: for the \"if\" direction, the group's adjoint representation image must be a subgroup of $O\\left(\\mathbf{g},\\,-B\\right)$ (where $\\mathbf{g}$ is the group's Lie algebra and $B$ the Killing form), since the Killing form is Ad-invariant. Thus the original group must be a finite cover (owing to the finite centre) of this compact beast. In the \"only if\" direction, one uses the compactness to build an Ad-invariant average over the group $G$ of an arbitrary pair of elements $x$ and $y$ the Lie algebra $B\\left(x,y\\right)=\\int_{\\gamma\\in G} \\left<{\\rm Ad}_\\gamma x, {\\rm Ad}_\\gamma y\\right> d\\mu(G)$, with $\\mu$ the Haar measure. Some simple gymnastics on this integral then shows it is negative definite. I would like a citation for the above proof if you know one. Does any one know of other proofs different from this one? With citations to a primary source, if you can, please. Many thanks in advance.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If $G$ is a compact Lie group with discrete centre then its Lie algebra $\\mathcal{G}$ has a trivial centre $Z(\\mathcal{G})=\\{0\\}$. Since $G$ is compact, it admits a bi-invariant metric (as you mention above) and $\\mathrm{ad}_x$ is antisymmetric for all $x\\in\\mathcal{G}$. Moreover, $\\mathrm{ad}_x$ is diagonalizable and has all his eigenvalues of the forme $i\\lambda$, $(\\lambda>0)$ then its Killing form is negative definite:\n$$K(x,x)=\\mathrm{tr}(\\mathrm{ad}_x\\mathrm{ad}_x)=-\\sum_{k=1}^n\\lambda_k^2<0$$\nIn the other direction, one may use the Myers theorem . But first, we must prove that the Ricci curvature of $\\mathcal{G}$ is strictly positive, for some bi-invariant scalar product on $\\mathcal{G}$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this Math Stack Exchange question and structure it according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor, so I need to make sure I understand the problem correctly and then list the assumptions and the problem statement properly.\n\nFirst, the original problem is about proving that a Lie group with finite center is compact if and only if its Killing form is negative definite. The user mentions they have a sketch of a proof and are looking for citations or other proofs with primary sources.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. The example had two assumptions: one about n being an integer and another about divisibility by 7. So here, I need to identify the key conditions from the problem.\n\nThe main conditions here are:\n1. The Lie group has a finite center.\n2. The Killing form is negative definite.\n3. The group is compact.\n\nBut wait, the problem is an \"if and only if\" statement. So the problem is to show that for a Lie group with finite center, compactness is equivalent to the Killing form being negative definite. Therefore, the assumptions should include the finite center, and the problem is the equivalence between compactness and negative definite Killing form.\n\nBut in the example, assumptions were about the given conditions. So in the original problem, the fixed condition is that the Lie group has a finite center. The other two parts (compactness and negative definite Killing form) are the ones to be connected via equivalence.\n\nSo the assumptions should list the properties that are given as part of the problem's hypothesis. Wait, the problem is structured as: Let G be a Lie group with finite center. Prove that G is compact if and only if its Killing form is negative definite.\n\nTherefore, the only assumption here is that the Lie group has a finite center. Then the problem is to prove the equivalence between compactness and negative definite Killing form.\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7, but in the formatted problem, the user corrected it to only n is an integer as the assumption, and the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. Hmm, maybe the example had an error? Wait, no, the original example had the problem statement that the number A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The user restructured it with assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but then the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the example was misformatted. Let me check.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91. The user formatted it with assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove A(n) is divisible by 91. Wait, that seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should just be n is an integer. But in the formatted problem, they added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. That seems like a mistake. Maybe the example is incorrect, but I should follow the user's instruction regardless.\n\nBut in the current problem, the original problem states that the Lie group has finite centre. So that's a given condition. The problem is to prove the equivalence between compactness and negative definite Killing form. So the assumptions here would be that the Lie group has finite centre. Then the problem is the equivalence.\n\nBut the user's example added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, perhaps in the example, the original problem actually had n being divisible by 7? Let me check again.\n\nThe original example problem says: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) - 6^n (3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove A(n) is divisible by 91. Wait, that's conflicting because in the original problem, n is any integer, but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That's not correct. The user might have made a mistake in their example. But regardless, I should follow the user's format as per their instruction, even if their example is flawed.\n\nBut perhaps the example was trying to say that the original problem had an error, and the correct problem requires n to be divisible by 7? Hmm, not sure. Maybe the user intended that the problem is to prove divisibility by 91 under the assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, but the original problem didn't specify that. Anyway, moving forward.\n\nSo for the current problem, the original question is: Proof that Lie group with finite centre is compact if and only if its Killing form is negative definite. The user then provides some details about the proof sketch and asks for citations or other proofs.\n\nTo structure this problem as per the user's format, I need to list the assumptions and then the problem. The assumptions are the given conditions. The problem is the statement to prove.\n\nGiven that, the problem is about a Lie group with finite centre. So the assumption here is that the Lie group has a finite centre. The problem is to prove that the group is compact if and only if its Killing form is negative definite.\n\nSo the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe Lie group has a finite center.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the Lie group is compact if and only if its Killing form is negative definite.\n\nI think that's correct. The finite center is the given condition, and the problem is the equivalence between compactness and negative definite Killing form. There's no other assumption stated in the original problem. The user's own description of the problem starts with \"a Lie group with finite centre is compact if and only if...\", so the finite centre is the given, and the rest is the equivalence to prove.\n\nThus, the assumptions list only the finite center, and the problem is the equivalence. The other conditions (compactness, negative definite Killing form) are part of the equivalence to prove, not assumptions.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the final answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nThe Lie group has a finite center.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the Lie group is compact if and only if its Killing form is negative definite.\n###",
