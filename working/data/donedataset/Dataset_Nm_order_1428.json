    "Content": "Find the smallest nontrivial conjugacy class in $S_n$. For small $n$, the answer can be found by counting the permutations of each possible cycle type. The result is:\n$$\\begin{array}{ccc}\nn & \\text{smallest nontrivial class(es)} & \\text{size} \\\\\n\\hline\n1 & \\text{none} & \\\\\n2 & \\text{transpositions} & 1 \\\\\n3 & 3\\text{-cycles} & 2 \\\\\n4 & \\text{double transpositions} & 3 \\\\\n5 & \\text{transpositions} & 10 \\\\\n6 & \\text{transpositions, triple transpositions} & 15\n\\end{array}$$ For $n\\geq 7$, I think the unique smallest nontrivial conjugacy class in $S_n$ is given by the transpositions. The conjugacy classes in $S_n$ are given by the sets of permutations of the same cycle type. For the cycle type $\\alpha = 1^{a_1} 2^{a_2} \\ldots$, the size of the respective conjugacy class is known to be\n$$N_\\alpha = \\frac{n!}{\\prod_i (i^{a_i} a_i!)}.$$\nIn particular, the number of transpositions in $S_n$ is $\\binom{n}{2}$. In this way, it remains to show the following: Let $n \\geq 7$ and $\\alpha$ be a partition of $n$ distinct from $1^n$ and $2^1 1^{n-2}$. Show that $N_\\alpha > \\binom{n}{2}$. So far I can only come up with a lengthy and technical case-by-case study.\nI'm looking for a more elegant proof of the statement.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I don't think there is a very conceptual approach giving a meaning to the comparison of conjugacy class sizes, but I think there is a way to make the argument quite short. The first thing to do is to cancel the term $a_1!$ for $i=1$ (for the points remaining fixed) in the denominator against a part of the numerator $n!$, which leaves the numerator equal to $n(n-1)\\ldots(a_1+1)$ (the number of factors is the sum of the sizes of the cycles for the conjugacy class, in the group-theoretic sense where cycles cannot have length$~1$). A first easy simplification rids us the case of mixed cycle structures, classes with is more than one different cycle length${}\\geq2$. For such cycle types we can map permutations in the class to another non-trivial cycle type by simply omitting the cycle(s) of the longest length$~l$ from the decomposition. This map commutes with any conjugation by a permutations (which simple relabels elements in the cycles) and is therefore surjective to a single new conjugacy class; moreover it is not injective since there is always more than one way to reconstruct the length$~l$ cycle(s). Therefore such classes are never the smallest non-trivial ones. The next step is to show that we need only deal with the case of transpositions, possibly flying in formation. More precisely (and with three exceptions that do not occur for $n\\geq7$), the class with $m$ disjoint $k$-cycles with $k>2$ is larger than the one with $m$ disjoint $2$-cycles. We have $a_k=m$ and factor our formula as\n$$\n  \\frac{n(n-1)\\ldots(n-mk+1)}{k^m}\\times\\frac1{m!},\n$$\nwhere the second factor is identical to the one for $k=2$. In the first factor replacing $k$ by $2$ means dropping the last $m(k-2)$ factors from the numerator and dividing the denominator by $(k/2)^m$. Using that a product of $k-2$ distinct positive integers can only be${}\\leq k/2$ if $k\\leq4$, we see that this decreases the first factor except when $a_1=0$, and $(m,k)\\in\\{(1,3),(1,4),(2,3)\\}$, which happens only for $n=3,4,6$ (it explains that $3$-cycles are least numerous for $n=3$, that for $n=4$ there are as many $4$-cycles as $2$-cycles, namely $6$, and that for $n=6$ there are fewer ($40$) pairs of $3$-cycles then pairs of transpositions $(45)$). We have reduced to the case of $m$ disjoint transpositions, which we shall compare with isolated transpositions ($m=1$). For fixed $m$, increasing $n$ leaves the denominator unchanged and increases all factors in the numerator by$~1$. This gives more relative increase for $m>1$ than for $m=1$, so if the class with $m$ disjoint transpositions is to be less numerous than that with one transposition, it must already be the case for the minimal possible value of $n$, which is $n=2m$. The formula for the number of products of  $m$ disjoint transpositions when $n=2m$ is the product $1\\times 3\\times\\cdots\\times(2m-1)$ (which some people, defying the ambiguity, write as $(2m-1)!!$) which is${}\\leq\\binom{2m}2$ only for $m=2,3$; this explains these cases for $n=4,6$. For $n\\geq7$ this does not happen any more.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to show that for n ≥ 7, the smallest nontrivial conjugacy class in S_n is the transpositions, which have size C(n,2). They need to prove that any other nontrivial conjugacy class (i.e., not the identity or transpositions) has size larger than C(n,2). \n\nFirst, I need to recall how conjugacy classes in S_n work. They're determined by cycle types, which are partitions of n. The size of a conjugacy class for a cycle type α is given by the formula N_α = n! / (product over i of (i^{a_i} * a_i!)), where α is 1^{a_1}2^{a_2}... So, for transpositions, the cycle type is 2^1 1^{n-2}, so N_α = n! / (2^1 * 1! * 1^{n-2} * (n-2)! ) ) = (n(n-1)/2) = C(n,2), which checks out.\n\nThe problem is to show that for any other nontrivial cycle type (not all 1's, which is the identity, and not the transposition), the size N_α is greater than C(n,2). The user mentions that they tried a case-by-case analysis but want a more elegant proof.\n\nLet me think about possible approaches. Maybe we can compare N_α with C(n,2) and find that for n ≥7, other cycle types necessarily lead to larger conjugacy classes. Let's consider different possible cycle types.\n\nFirst, the trivial case: the identity has cycle type 1^n, which is excluded. The transpositions are 2^1 1^{n-2}, also excluded. So other cycle types could be:\n\n- 3-cycles: 3^1 1^{n-3}\n- Double transpositions: 2^2 1^{n-4}\n- 4-cycles: 4^1 1^{n-4}\n- 5-cycles, etc.\n- Cycles with more cycles, like 3^2 1^{n-6}, etc.\n\nFor each of these, compute N_α and see if it's larger than C(n,2). Let's check some examples.\n\nTake n=7. The transpositions have size 21. Let's check 3-cycles: N_α = 7! / (3^1 *1! *1^4 *4! ) = 5040 / (3*24) = 5040/(72)=70, which is 70 >21. Double transpositions (2^2 1^3): N_α=7!/(2^2*2! *1^3 *3!)=5040/(4*2*6)=5040/48=105>21. 4-cycles: 7!/(4^1*1! *1^3 *3!)=5040/(4*6)=5040/24=210>21. Similarly, a 5-cycle would be 7!/(5*1! *1^2 *2!)=5040/(5*2)=5040/10=504>21. So indeed, all other classes are larger.\n\nBut how to generalize this for all n ≥7? Maybe we can argue that any cycle type other than transpositions will have either a cycle of length ≥3 or multiple transpositions. Let's see.\n\nCase 1: The cycle type includes a cycle of length ≥3. For example, a single k-cycle where k ≥3. Let's compute N_α for a single k-cycle. The formula is n!/(k * 1! *1^{n-k}*(n-k)!)) = (n-1)! / (k-1)! ) Wait, no: Wait, the formula is N_α = n! / (product over i of i^{a_i} a_i! ). For a single k-cycle, the cycle type is k^1 1^{n−k}. So the denominator is k^1 *1! * 1^{n−k} * (n−k)! ). So N_α = n! / (k * (n−k)! ). Compare this to C(n,2)=n(n−1)/2.\n\nSo for a single k-cycle, N_α = n!/(k*(n−k)!) = n(n−1)(n−2)...(n−k+1)/k. For k=3, this is n(n−1)(n−2)/6. For n ≥7, let's compare this to C(n,2)=n(n−1)/2. For k=3, N_α = n(n−1)(n−2)/6. Let's compute the ratio: [n(n−1)(n−2)/6] / [n(n−1)/2] = (n−2)/3. For n ≥7, (n−2)/3 ≥ (7−2)/3=5/3 >1. Therefore, N_α for a 3-cycle is larger than C(n,2) when n ≥7. So any single k-cycle with k ≥3 will have N_α larger than C(n,2).\n\nCase 2: The cycle type consists of multiple transpositions. For example, two transpositions (double transpositions) and the rest fixed points. The cycle type is 2^2 1^{n−4}. Then N_α = n! / (2^2 *2! *1^{n−4}*(n−4)! ) = n!/(4*2*(n−4)! )) = n(n−1)(n−2)(n−3)/8. Let's compare to C(n,2)=n(n−1)/2. The ratio is [n(n−1)(n−2)(n−3)/8] / [n(n−1)/2] = (n−2)(n−3)/4. For n=7, this is (5)(4)/4=5>1. For n=8, (6)(5)/4=7.5>1. So yes, for n≥7, this ratio is greater than 1. Therefore, double transpositions have larger class size.\n\nSimilarly, if there are three transpositions (cycle type 2^3 1^{n−6}), then N_α = n!/(2^3 *3! *1^{n−6}*(n−6)! )) = n!/(8*6*(n−6)! )) = n(n−1)(n−2)(n−3)(n−4)(n−5)/(8*6). Compare to C(n,2). Let's compute the ratio: [n(n−1)(n−2)(n−3)(n−4)(n−5)/48] / [n(n−1)/2] = [(n−2)(n−3)(n−4)(n−5)/24]. For n=7: (5)(4)(3)(2)/24=120/24=5>1. For n=8: (6)(5)(4)(3)/24=360/24=15>1. So again, larger.\n\nCase 3: Cycle types with a combination of cycles. For example, a 3-cycle and a transposition: cycle type 3^1 2^1 1^{n−5}. Then N_α = n!/(3^1*1! *2^1*1! *1^{n−5}*(n−5)! ) = n!/(3*2*(n−5)! )) = n(n−1)(n−2)(n−3)(n−4)/12. Compare to C(n,2). The ratio is [n(n−1)(n−2)(n−3)(n−4)/12] / [n(n−1)/2] = [(n−2)(n−3)(n−4)/6]. For n=7: (5)(4)(3)/6=60/6=10>1. For n=8: (6)(5)(4)/6=120/6=20>1. So again, larger.\n\nWhat about longer cycles? For example, a 4-cycle and a 3-cycle in S_7: cycle type 4^1 3^1. Then N_α = 7!/(4*1! *3*1! ) = 5040/(4*3)=5040/12=420. C(7,2)=21. So much larger.\n\nAnother case: cycle type with a single transposition and the rest fixed points. That's the transposition case, which is excluded. Any other cycle type must have at least one cycle of length ≥3 or multiple transpositions, which we've covered.\n\nTherefore, for any nontrivial cycle type different from a single transposition, the conjugacy class size is larger than C(n,2) when n ≥7.\n\nBut how to formalize this without doing each case? Maybe argue that the minimal number of permutations is achieved when the cycle type is as \"small\" as possible, i.e., a single transposition. Any other cycle type either increases the cycle length or adds more cycles, both of which contribute to increasing the size of the conjugacy class.\n\nAlternatively, we can use induction. Suppose for n, the minimal nontrivial conjugacy class is transpositions. For n+1, adding another element could affect the sizes, but transpositions in S_{n+1} have size C(n+1,2) = n(n+1)/2, and other cycle types would need to be compared.\n\nAlternatively, consider that for any cycle type other than transpositions, the formula N_α must have a denominator that is smaller than the denominator for transpositions, leading to a larger fraction.\n\nWait, the denominator for transpositions is 2*1!*1^{n-2}*(n-2)! = 2*(n-2)!.\n\nFor another cycle type, say with a k-cycle (k≥3) and the rest fixed points, denominator is k*1! *1^{n-k}*(n-k)! = k*(n−k)!.\n\nSo N_α for transpositions is n!/(2*(n−2)!) = n(n−1)/2.\n\nFor a k-cycle, N_α = n!/(k*(n−k)!).\n\nTo compare N_α for k-cycle vs transpositions: n!/(k*(n−k)! ) vs n(n−1)/2.\n\nWhich is larger? For k ≥3, and n−k ≥0.\n\nLet’s take k=3: n!/(3*(n−3)! ) = n(n−1)(n−2)/6. Compare to n(n−1)/2. The ratio is (n−2)/3. For n ≥7, this ratio is ≥5/3 >1, so yes, larger.\n\nSimilarly, for k=4: N_α = n(n−1)(n−2)(n−3)/24. Compare to n(n−1)/2. Ratio is (n−2)(n−3)/12. For n=7: (5)(4)/12=20/12≈1.666>1. For n=8: 6*5/12=30/12=2.5>1. So again, larger.\n\nSimilarly, for any k ≥3, the ratio would be a product of terms that for n ≥7 will be greater than 1.\n\nSimilarly, if the cycle type has multiple cycles, like two transpositions: denominator is 2^2 *2! * (n−4)! = 8*(n−4)!.\n\nSo N_α = n!/(8*(n−4)! ) = n(n−1)(n−2)(n−3)/8. Compare to C(n,2)=n(n−1)/2. Ratio is (n−2)(n−3)/4. For n=7: 5*4/4=5>1. For larger n, even bigger.\n\nThus, perhaps we can argue generally that any other cycle type either requires dividing by a smaller denominator (thus making N_α larger) or involves multiple cycles which also increases N_α.\n\nAlternatively, think of the formula N_α = n! / (product i^{a_i} a_i! ). To minimize N_α, we need to maximize the denominator. The transposition case gives denominator 2*(n−2)!.\n\nFor other cycle types, suppose we have a partition where the product i^{a_i} a_i! is larger. Wait, but actually, to make N_α small, you need the denominator to be large. But in our case, the transpositions have denominator 2*(n−2)!.\n\nOther cycle types will have denominators that are either smaller or larger. Wait, if the denominator is larger, then N_α is smaller. But we want to show that N_α is larger than C(n,2), so we need to show that other cycle types have denominators smaller than 2*(n−2)!.\n\nWait, actually, transpositions have denominator 2*(n−2)! (from 2^1 *1! *1^{n-2}*(n−2)! ). So to get a smaller denominator (leading to larger N_α), other cycle types need their denominators to be smaller than 2*(n−2)!.\n\nSo let's check for other cycle types.\n\nTake a 3-cycle: denominator is 3*(n−3)!.\n\nCompare to 2*(n−2)! =2*(n−2)(n−3)!.\n\nSo 3*(n−3)! vs 2*(n−2)(n−3)!.\n\nWhich is smaller? 3 vs 2(n−2).\n\nFor n ≥7, 2(n−2) ≥2*5=10, which is greater than 3. Therefore, 3*(n−3)! < 2*(n−2)(n−3)! => denominator for 3-cycle is smaller => N_α is larger.\n\nSimilarly, for a double transposition: denominator is 2^2 *2! * (n−4)! =4*2*(n−4)! =8*(n−4)!.\n\nCompare to 2*(n−2)! =2*(n−2)(n−3)(n−4)!.\n\nSo denominator for double transpositions is 8*(n−4)! vs denominator for transpositions 2*(n−2)(n−3)(n−4)!.\n\nWhich is smaller? 8 vs 2(n−2)(n−3). For n≥7, 2(n−2)(n−3) ≥2*5*4=40, which is greater than 8. Thus, denominator for double transpositions is smaller (8 <40), so N_α is larger.\n\nThus, in general, any other cycle type will have a denominator smaller than that of transpositions, leading to a larger N_α. Therefore, transpositions have the smallest nontrivial conjugacy class.\n\nThis seems to hold. Therefore, the key idea is that the denominator in the conjugacy class size formula for any nontrivial cycle type other than transpositions is necessarily smaller than that for transpositions when n≥7, leading to a larger class size. Hence, transpositions are the smallest.",
