    "Content": "Let $\\sigma(x)$ be the sum of the divisors of the positive integer $x$ . If $\\sigma(M) = 2M$ , then $M$ is said to be perfect. Currently, as of December 2018, there are $51$ known examples of even perfect numbers -- on the other hand, we still do not know whether there are any odd perfect numbers. Euler derived the general form that an odd perfect number $N$ must take: $$N = {q^k}{n^2},$$ where $q \\equiv k \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$ and $\\gcd(q,n) = 1$ .  We call $q$ the special or Euler prime of $N$ . Descartes, Frenicle and subsequently Sorli conjectured that $k = 1$ . In [Dris, 2012] , it was shown that the implications $$n < q \\Longrightarrow k = 1$$ and $$n < q^2 \\Longrightarrow k = 1$$ are true. Now, note that, since $q$ and $\\sigma(q) = q + 1$ are consecutive integers, then the following implications are true. Case 1: $q^k < n < \\sigma(q^k) < \\sigma(n) \\Longrightarrow k > 1$ Case 2: $n < q^k < \\sigma(n) < \\sigma(q^k) \\Longrightarrow k > 1$ The remaining cases to be considered are: Case 3: $q^k < \\sigma(q^k) < n < \\sigma(n) \\land k \\geq 1$ Case 4: $n < \\sigma(n) < q^k < \\sigma(q^k) \\land k \\geq 1$ Case 5: $n < q^k \\leq \\sigma(n) < \\sigma(q^k) \\land k \\geq 1$ Case 6: $n < q^k < \\sigma(q^k) \\leq \\sigma(n) \\land k \\geq 1$ Am I right in thinking that it is possible to prove the following implication, given the above cases? CLAIM: If $N = {q^k}{n^2}$ is an odd perfect number given in Eulerian form, then $$n < q^{k + 1} \\Longrightarrow k \\neq 1.$$ Easy to prove for Cases 1 and 2.  Should also be doable for the rest.  Anybody have any ideas? Added September 12 2016 From one of the answers below, it can be shown that the condition $q^2 < n$ is equivalent to the truth of the implication $$n < q^{k + 1} \\Longrightarrow k \\neq 1.$$",

However, I think that the proof for Proposition 1 is not correct. I don't think that you have proved $$\\sigma(q^k) < \\sigma(n)\\implies q^k \\lt n$$ It is true that $q^k\\lt n\\implies \\sigma(q^k)\\lt\\sigma(n)$ . It is true that $q^k\\lt n\\implies\\frac{\\sigma(q^k)}{n}\\lt\\frac{\\sigma(n)}{q^k}$ . Assuming that $q^k\\lt n$ , we see that it is true that $k = 1 \\implies \\sigma(q^k) < n$ . Assuming that $q^k\\lt n$ , we see that the remaining case is Case 3. It is true that $q^2 < n \\iff \\left\\{n<q^{k+1} \\implies k>1\\right\\}$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is asking about odd perfect numbers, specifically whether if N = q^k n^2 is an odd perfect number in Eulerian form and n < q^{k+1}, does it follow that k > 1.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The problem states that N is an odd perfect number given in Eulerian form. From Euler's result, we know that N = q^k n^2 where q ≡ k ≡ 1 mod 4, and gcd(q, n) = 1. So those are the base conditions. The specific condition given here is n < q^{k+1}, and the claim is that this implies k ≠ 1, which would mean k > 1 since k is at least 1 and congruent to 1 mod 4. So the assumptions should include each of these conditions separately.\n\nLooking at the example, each assumption is a single property applied to one object. So for this problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- N is an odd perfect number (first stated in the problem)\n- N is expressed in Eulerian form as q^k n^2 (since that's a given condition)\n- q ≡ 1 mod 4 (as per Euler's form)\n- k ≡ 1 mod 4 (same reason)\n- gcd(q, n) = 1 (another part of Euler's form)\n- n < q^{k+1} (the specific condition given in the problem)\n\nThe problem is then to prove that under these assumptions, k ≠ 1. So the problem statement is the claim: If N = q^k n^2 is an odd perfect number given in Eulerian form, then n < q^{k+1} implies k ≠ 1.\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is a single line, one condition per line. Let me check again:\n\n1. N is an odd perfect number.\n2. N is expressed as q^k n^2 where q, k, n are positive integers.\n3. q ≡ 1 mod 4.\n4. k ≡ 1 mod 4.\n5. gcd(q, n) = 1.\n6. n < q^{k + 1}.\n\nWait, the Eulerian form is part of the problem's given, so combining the expression of N and the congruence conditions. But the example given in the original example had separate lines for each condition. For instance, in the example, they listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. So here, each congruence and gcd condition should be separate.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nN is an odd perfect number,\nN is expressed in Eulerian form as N = q^k n^2,\nq ≡ 1 mod 4,\nk ≡ 1 mod 4,\ngcd(q, n) = 1,\nn < q^{k + 1}.\n\nProblem: Prove that k ≠ 1.\n\nYes, that seems right. Each assumption is a single condition. The problem is to prove k ≠ 1 under those assumptions. The user mentions that they want to prove the implication: if n < q^{k+1}, then k ≠ 1. So the problem is to show that under the given conditions (including n < q^{k+1}), k cannot be 1.",
