    "Content": "The problem given to me on my homework is: Prove that the limit of a decreasing family of outer measures is an outer measure. Doing out the \"obvious\" approach, we quickly reach the problem of wanting to say that\n$$\\lim_{j\\to\\infty}\\;\\mu_j^*\\left(\\bigcup_{i=1}^\\infty A_i\\right)\\leq\\lim_{j\\to\\infty}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty\\;\\mu_j^*(A_i)\\right)\\underbrace{\\leq}_{\\text{PROBLEM}}\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty\\left(\\lim_{j\\to\\infty}\\;\\mu_j^*(A_i)\\right)$$\nThe problem, as I see it, is that Fatou's Lemma has the inequality going the opposite way of what we want here (by the way, this course hasn't actually gotten to integration yet). In fact, I think the claim is false, because I can imagine very well having the following scenario: $\\{A_i\\}_{i=1}^\\infty\\subset \\mathcal{P}(X)$ is a family of subsets of $X$ (disjoint, probably) $\\mu_j^*:\\mathcal{P}(X)\\to[0,\\infty]$ are decreasing family of outer measures on $X$ with the property that\n$$\\mu_j^*(A_i)=\\begin{cases}1\\text{ if }j\\leq i\\\\ 0\\text{ if }j>i \\end{cases}$$\n(This certainly would not be in conflict with the assumption that the $\\mu_j^*$ are decreasing, i.e. that $\\mu_j^*(A)\\geq\\mu_{j+1}^*(A)$ for all $j\\in\\mathbb{N}$ and $A\\subseteq X$.) Letting $\\mu^*:\\mathcal{P}(X)\\to[0,\\infty]$ be defined by $\\mu^*(A)=\\lim_{j\\to\\infty}\\mu_j^*(A)$, we conclude immediately that $\\mu^*(\\varnothing)=0$ and that $\\mu^*(A)\\leq\\mu^*(B)$ when $A\\subseteq B$, but we then have that\n$$\\mu^*\\left(\\bigcup_{i=1}^\\infty A_i\\right)=\\lim_{j\\to\\infty}\\;\\mu_j^*\\left(\\bigcup_{i=1}^\\infty A_i\\right)\\geq\\lim_{j\\to\\infty}\\;\\mu_j^*(A_j)=\\lim_{j\\to\\infty}\\;1=1$$\nwhile\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty\\;\\mu^*(A_i)=\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty\\left(\\lim_{j\\to\\infty}\\;\\mu_j^*(A_i)\\right)=\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty\\left(\\lim_{j\\to\\infty}\\;\\;{1\\text{ if }j\\leq i\\atop 0\\text{ if }j>i}\\right)=\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty\\;0=0 $$\nso that \n$$\\mu^*\\left(\\bigcup_{i=1}^\\infty A_i\\right)\\not\\leq\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty\\;\\mu^*(A_i)$$\nand therefore $\\mu^*$ is not an outer measure. So, giving as little away as possible (as this is a homework question), is the scenario I proposed above impossible? I tried to construct examples with $X=\\mathbb{N}$ and the value of $\\mu_j^*(A)$ depending on whether $A\\cap\\{1,\\ldots,j\\}=\\varnothing$, but that didn't get anywhere.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $\\gamma$ be the counting measure on the positive integers. Define \n$\\mu^*_j(A) = \\gamma( \\{ x \\in A | x \\ge j \\})$.\nThat this sequence is decreasing follows from the monotonicity of $\\gamma$.\nSince every finite set is bounded, its measure converges to 0 as $j \\to \\infty$.\nOn the other hand, the measure of infinite sets is infinite for all $j$.\nThis contradicts countable subadditivity of the limit. I have not checked, but it seems likely that the exercise can be fixed by substituting \"finite outer measure\" for \"outer measure\".",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is asking whether the limit of a decreasing sequence of outer measures is an outer measure. They tried the standard approach but ran into an issue with switching the limit and the sum, which would require Fatou's lemma, but the inequality goes the wrong way. Then they proposed a counterexample where each outer measure μ_j* assigns 1 to A_i if j ≤ i and 0 otherwise. This setup seems to violate the countable subadditivity of the limit μ* because when you take the union of all A_i, the limit μ* gives 1, but the sum of μ*(A_i) is 0. \n\nSo, the task is to structure this problem according to the given format. Let's start with the Assumptions. The problem statement mentions a decreasing family of outer measures. Each μ_j* is an outer measure, and they're decreasing, meaning μ_j*(A) ≥ μ_{j+1}*(A) for all j and A. The problem is to prove that the limit μ* is an outer measure. However, the user argues that this isn't necessarily true by constructing a scenario where countable subadditivity fails.\n\nThe original problem from the homework was to prove the statement, but the user is questioning its validity. So, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. For each j in N, μ_j* is an outer measure on X.\n2. The family {μ_j*} is decreasing, i.e., μ_j*(A) ≥ μ_{j+1}*(A) for all j in N and all subsets A of X.\n3. μ* is defined as the limit of μ_j* as j approaches infinity.\n\nThe problem is to determine whether μ* is an outer measure. The user is asserting that it's not necessarily true by providing a counterexample. However, in the example provided earlier, the problem was structured with assumptions and then the problem. Here, the original problem was to prove the limit is an outer measure, but the user is showing a possible counterexample. \n\nWait, the original problem given in the homework was to \"Prove that the limit of a decreasing family of outer measures is an outer measure.\" So the formatted problem should reflect that original question, not the user's counterexample. The user is questioning the validity of the original problem by providing a possible counterexample. So in the formatted problem, the assumptions are the decreasing family of outer measures, and the problem is to prove the limit is an outer measure. But according to the user's analysis, this is false. However, when structuring the problem as per the example, we need to present the original problem's assumptions and the problem statement. The user's own thoughts about the counterexample are part of their solution, but the formatted problem should be the original problem. \n\nSo, the Assumptions would be:\n\n- For each natural number j, μ_j* is an outer measure on X.\n- The family {μ_j*} is decreasing: μ_j*(A) ≥ μ_{j+1}*(A) for all j in N and all subsets A of X.\n- μ* is defined by μ*(A) = lim_{j→∞} μ_j*(A) for each subset A of X.\n\nProblem: Prove that μ* is an outer measure on X.\n\nBut wait, the user's example in the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". But the user included that as an assumption. Wait, in the example given by the user, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, the assumption was that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe not. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe original example's problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem's assumption was \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". But that seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in their example. Because if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem's assumptions shouldn't add \"n is divisible by 7\" unless there was a misinterpretation. However, perhaps the example is illustrative of how to structure, not necessarily accurate. Anyway, the key is to follow the instruction: list all the assumptions from the original problem, each as a separate line.\n\nIn the current case, the original problem is: Prove that the limit of a decreasing family of outer measures is an outer measure. So the assumptions are:\n\n1. Each μ_j* is an outer measure (so each satisfies the outer measure axioms: null empty set, monotonicity, countable subadditivity).\n2. The family {μ_j*} is decreasing, i.e., μ_j*(A) ≥ μ_{j+1}*(A) for all A ⊆ X and all j.\n3. μ* is defined as the limit of μ_j* as j → ∞.\n\nThe problem is to prove that μ* is an outer measure.\n\nBut in the user's analysis, they are challenging this by constructing a scenario where μ* fails to be countably subadditive. So in the formatted problem, we need to structure the original problem as per the given instructions, which is to list the assumptions and the problem.\n\nSo, the correct formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nFor each natural number j, μ_j^* is an outer measure on X,\nThe sequence {μ_j^*} is decreasing: μ_j^*(A) ≥ μ_{j+1}^*(A) for all subsets A of X and all j,\nμ^*(A) is defined as the limit of μ_j^*(A) as j approaches infinity for each subset A of X.\nProblem:\nProve that μ^* is an outer measure on X.\n\nHowever, the user is pointing out that this is not true in general. But the original problem given to the user was to prove it, so the formatted problem is that. The user is then questioning the validity. So when structuring the problem as per the instructions, it should be the original problem's assumptions and question. The user's counterexample is part of their solution, not part of the problem's structure.",
