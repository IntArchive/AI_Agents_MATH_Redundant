    "AcceptedAnswer": "The result you want to show should be: if $x_n$ converges to $x$ weakly and $\\lVert x_n\\rVert\\to \\lVert x\\rVert$, then there is convergence in norm. To see that, expand $\\lVert x_n-x\\rVert^2$ and use the fact that $\\langle x_n,x\\rangle\\to \\lVert x\\rVert^2$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual math professor and structure a given problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. First, I need to understand the original question thoroughly. \n\nThe original question is about weak convergence and strong convergence in a Hilbert space. The problem states: If a sequence (x_n) converges weakly to x in a Hilbert space H and the norms of x_n converge to the norm of x, then we need to show that x_n converges strongly to x. \n\nNow, the task is to extract the assumptions and the problem statement according to the given format. Let's look at the example provided. The example had two assumptions: one about n being an integer and another about n being divisible by 7. Each assumption is a single condition applied to one object.\n\nSo, for the current problem, the assumptions would be the conditions given in the problem. The sequence (x_n) is weakly convergent in H, and the norms ||x_n|| converge to ||x||. These are two separate conditions. Each should be listed as individual assumptions. \n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption about divisibility by 7 was part of the original problem. But in the current problem, the user might have included \"original problem was incorrect\" as context. However, the formatted problem in the example didn't include the context, only the mathematical assumptions. So, in this case, the context about the exam paper and the original problem being incorrect is probably not part of the assumptions. \n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. (x_n) is a weakly convergent sequence in H. So, each term x_n is in H, and they converge weakly to some x.\n\n2. The norm of x_n converges to the norm of x. \n\nThese are two separate conditions. So, each should be a line in the assumptions. Then the problem is to show that x_n converges strongly to x.\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is a single condition. The first assumption is that the sequence is weakly convergent in H. The second is that the norms converge to the norm of the limit. The problem is to show strong convergence. \n\nSo, structuring this:\n\nAssumption: \n(x_n) is a weakly convergent sequence in a Hilbert space H,\n||x_n|| converges to ||x||.\n\nProblem: Show that x_n converges strongly to x.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"Let (x_n) be a weakly convergent sequence in a Hilbert space H. If ||x_n|| → ||x||, show that x_n converges strongly to x.\" So the assumptions are two: weak convergence of x_n to x in H, and the convergence of the norms. Wait, actually, in the problem statement, when it says \"weakly convergent sequence in H\", the limit is x. So perhaps we need to clarify that (x_n) converges weakly to x. The original problem states \"weakly convergent sequence\" but in Hilbert spaces, weakly convergent means there exists some x such that x_n converges weakly to x. But the problem statement should specify that x is the weak limit. So perhaps the first assumption is \"(x_n) converges weakly to x in H\", and the second is \"||x_n|| converges to ||x||\". Then the problem is to show strong convergence (i.e., convergence in norm) to x.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n(x_n) converges weakly to x in Hilbert space H,\nThe norm of x_n converges to the norm of x.\n\nProblem:\nShow that x_n converges strongly to x.\n\nYes, that seems accurate. Each assumption is a single condition. The first is about weak convergence to x, the second about the norms. Then the problem is to show strong convergence.\n\nI need to make sure there are no other hidden assumptions. The problem mentions \"Hilbert space H\" so perhaps that's part of the setting, but in the example, the assumptions were about the variable n. Here, the Hilbert space is the environment, but the key assumptions are about the sequence's convergence properties. So the structured problem should list the two conditions on the sequence as assumptions.\n\nThus, the final formatted problem should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$(x_n)$ converges weakly to $x$ in a Hilbert space $H$,\n$\\| x_n \\| \\to \\| x \\|$ as $n \\to \\infty$.\nProblem: \nShow that $x_n$ converges strongly to $x$.\n###END_OF_FORMAT###",
