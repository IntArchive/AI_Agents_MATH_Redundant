    "AcceptedAnswer": "Consider the powers of the subset $S$: $$S, S^2, S^3, S^4, \\ldots$$ Because $G$ is finite, there is eventually some repetition. Let $S^r = S^{r+s}$ where $s > 0$ and $r+s$ is as small as possible. Then $$S, S^2, S^3, \\ldots, S^{r-1}, S^r, S^{r+1}, \\ldots, S^{r+s-1}$$ are distinct subsets of $G$. Furthermore, $\\{S^r, S^{r+1}, \\ldots, S^{r+s-1}\\}$ is a (cyclic) subgroup of order $s$ in the semigroup of nonempty subsets of $G$. Thus it is equal to $H/K$ for some $K \\trianglelefteq H \\leq G$ (this is not too difficult to prove, see 3.57 in \"A Course in Group Theory\" by Rose). Hence $s$ divides the order of $G$. Next note that for each $t \\geq r$, we have that $S^t = S^{t+s}$. Choose $r \\leq t < r+s$ so that $s$ divides $t$. Then $S^t = S^{t+t} = (S^t)^2$, so $S^t$ is a subgroup (in fact, it is the only power of $S$ that is a subgroup). Now if would suffice to prove that $|G| \\geq r$. If this is the case, then $|G| - t = ks$ for some $k \\geq 0$ and so $S^{|G|} = S^{t+ks} = S^t$. Let $x \\in S$. Now $xS^i \\subseteq S^{i+1}$, so $|S^i| = |xS^i| \\leq |S^{i+1}|$. Thus if $|S^i| = |S^{i+1}|$, then $xS^i = S^{i+1}$. Hence $$S^{i+2} = S^{i+1}S = xS^iS = xS^{i+1} = x^2S^{i}$$ and similarly $S^{i+k} = x^kS^i$ for all $k \\geq 1$. In particular when $k = |G|$, we see that $S^{i+|G|} = S^i$. Thus $i \\geq r$, since $S^r$ is the first power of $S$ that repeats. So when $i < r$, we have $|S^i| < |S^{i+1}|$ which gives $$|S| < |S^2| < |S^3| < \\ldots < |S^r|$$ and so we can find at least $r$ distinct elements in $|S^r|$, which proves that $|G| \\geq r$. Related to this answer: cyclic semigroups .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. Let me start by reading the original question carefully.\n\nThe title is: \"If $S$ is a nonempty subset of group $G$, then $S^{|G|}$ is a subgroup of $G$.\" The question body says: Let $G$ be a group with $|G| = n$ and let $\\emptyset \\ne S \\subseteq G$. I want to show that $S^n$ is a subgroup of $G$ where by $S^n$ I mean the set $\\lbrace s_1\\cdots s_n \\; | \\; s_i \\in S\\rbrace$.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The user mentions that $G$ is a group, so that's one assumption. The order of $G$ is $n$, which is another. Then $S$ is a nonempty subset of $G$, so that's the third assumption. The problem is to show that $S^n$ (defined as all products of $n$ elements from $S$) is a subgroup of $G$.\n\nWait, in the example given earlier, the assumptions were split into separate lines, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So let me break it down:\n\n1. $G$ is a group. (This is given.)\n2. $|G| = n$. (The order of the group is $n$.)\n3. $S$ is a nonempty subset of $G$. ($S$ is not empty and is contained in $G$.)\n\nThese are the three main assumptions. The problem then is to prove that $S^n$ is a subgroup of $G$. \n\nI need to check if there are any hidden assumptions or conditions. The original problem doesn't mention any additional constraints on $S$ except that it's nonempty. The user is probably assuming that $G$ is finite since they're using $|G| = n$ and talking about $S^n$ with $n$ elements. But since the group order is given as $n$, that's already covered.\n\nSo the assumptions are clear: group $G$ of order $n$, nonempty subset $S$, and the problem is to show $S^n$ is a subgroup. \n\nI should present each assumption on a separate line. Let me structure that.",
