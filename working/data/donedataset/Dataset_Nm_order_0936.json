    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example they provided shows how assumptions and the problem are separated. The original problem here is about showing that a root of the equation x(x+1)...(x+2009) = c can have multiplicity at most 2 and finding the value of c for which this is possible.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original problem and extract the assumptions. The problem statement mentions an equation which is a product from x to x+2009 equals c. The user is asking about the multiplicity of a root being at most 2. The original approach tried derivatives but found the number of terms too large.\n\nLooking at the example given, assumptions are about the properties of the variables involved. For this problem, the main objects are the polynomial P(x) = x(x+1)...(x+2009), the constant c, and the roots of the equation P(x) = c. \n\nAssumptions would need to be each single property applied to one object. So first, the polynomial is of degree 2010 since it's a product from x to x+2009 (which is 2010 terms, each linear). Then, the equation P(x) = c. A root with multiplicity higher than 2 would mean that both the polynomial minus c and its first and second derivatives are zero at that root. The problem wants to show that multiplicity cannot exceed 2, so perhaps the key is that the third derivative can't be zero? Or maybe there's a property of the polynomial that limits the multiplicity.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included that n is divisible by 7. Here, the problem doesn't state any such restrictions, except what's inherent in the problem. So maybe the assumptions are more about the setup. Let me think. The problem states \"a root of the equation x(x+1)...(x+2009) = c can have multiplicity at most 2\". So the equation is P(x) = c, where P(x) is the product. A root with multiplicity m would satisfy P(x) - c = 0, P'(x) = 0, ..., P^{(m)}(x) = 0. So to have multiplicity 3, we need P(x) - c, P'(x), P''(x), P'''(x) all zero at that root. But the user wants to show that multiplicity is at most 2, so such a root cannot exist. \n\nPossible assumptions: the polynomial is of degree 2010, which is important because the number of roots (considering multiplicity) can't exceed the degree. Also, the roots of P(x) - c are considered. But the specific assumptions for the problem would be about the structure of the polynomial. Wait, maybe the roots of P(x) = c are all simple or double roots, and none can have higher multiplicity. So the assumptions would be:\n\n1. The polynomial is defined as P(x) = x(x+1)(x+2)...(x+2009).\n2. c is a constant.\n3. A root of the equation P(x) = c has multiplicity m.\n\nThen the problem is to show that m ≤ 2 and find the c where this is possible. But in the example, the assumption included specific conditions like n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem doesn't have such explicit conditions except those inherent in the equation. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- The equation is x(x+1)...(x+2009) = c.\n- The multiplicity of a root refers to its multiplicity as a solution to the equation.\n\nBut perhaps more precise. Each root of P(x) - c = 0. For multiplicity at least 3, the first, second, and third derivatives would also vanish there. So maybe the key is that if a root has multiplicity 3, then P'''(x) = 0 at that point. But the polynomial P(x) is of degree 2010, so its third derivative is of degree 2007, which can have many roots. However, the problem states that such a root can't exist. Therefore, the user needs to structure this problem by listing assumptions. The main assumptions here are:\n\n- The polynomial P(x) is the product of (x + k) for k from 0 to 2009.\n- The equation P(x) = c is considered.\n- A root of multiplicity m ≥ 3 would satisfy P(x) - c = 0, P'(x) = 0, P''(x) = 0, and P'''(x) = 0 at that root.\n\nBut how to phrase each assumption as a single line? The example had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nP(x) = x(x+1)(x+2)...(x+2009),\nc is a constant,\nmultiplicity of a root refers to its multiplicity in the equation P(x) = c.\n\nBut maybe more precise. Since the problem is to show that multiplicity can be at most 2, perhaps the key is that if there were a root of multiplicity 3, then certain conditions would hold, but those conditions lead to a contradiction. Therefore, the assumptions would need to capture the essential properties that prevent higher multiplicity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key assumption is that the polynomial P(x) is such that P'(x) and P''(x) cannot have a common root that is also a root of P(x) - c = 0. But I think the user just wants the problem's inherent assumptions. So the original problem's assumptions are:\n\n1. P(x) is defined as the product from x to x+2009.\n2. c is a real constant.\n3. The equation considered is P(x) = c.\n4. A root of this equation has multiplicity m if P(x) - c, P'(x), ..., P^{(m-1)}(x) vanish at that root.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption is a single line addressing one property. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nP(x) = x(x+1)(x+2)...(x+2009),\nc is a constant,\na root of the equation P(x) = c has multiplicity m.\n\nBut the problem is to show that m ≤ 2. Wait, the example didn't include all possible properties but just the given ones. In the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted assumption, it's \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the original example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the user added the assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so maybe the example had a mistake? Or perhaps the user was giving an example of how to structure. Hmm.\n\nWait, the example given by the user was:\n\nOriginal problem:\nProve that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut that seems incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption adds that n is divisible by 7. Maybe the example is wrong? Or perhaps the user made a mistake. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instruction. So in that example, the formatted problem includes assumptions that may not be in the original problem, but perhaps the user intended to filter out some conditions. But that's confusing.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user wants to format the problem from Math Stack Exchange into assumptions and problem. The original problem is: Show that a root of the equation x(x+1)...(x+2009) = c can have multiplicity at most 2, and find c.\n\nSo the key assumptions are:\n\n- The polynomial is P(x) = x(x+1)...(x+2009)\n- The equation is P(x) = c\n- The multiplicity of a root refers to the equation P(x) = c\n\nBut perhaps each assumption line should be one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\nP(x) is a polynomial defined as the product of (x + k) for k from 0 to 2009,\nThe equation P(x) = c is considered,\nMultiplicity of a root is with respect to the equation P(x) = c.\n\nBut maybe more precise. Alternatively, considering that when you set P(x) = c, the roots are solutions where P(x) - c = 0. The multiplicity is how many times the root is a solution when considering derivatives. So to have multiplicity 3, the root would need to satisfy P(x) - c = 0, P’(x) = 0, P’’(x) = 0, P’’’(x) = 0. The problem is to show that such a root can't exist, hence multiplicity at most 2.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be the structure of P(x) and the equation. The problem is to show that multiplicity cannot exceed 2 and find c.\n\nSo structuring:\n\nAssumption:\nP(x) = x(x+1)(x+2)...(x+2009),\nc is a constant,\nmultiplicity of a root α of P(x) = c is the largest integer m such that P(α) - c = 0 and the first m-1 derivatives of P(x) - c vanish at α.\n\nProblem:\nShow that any root of the equation P(x) = c has multiplicity at most 2, and find the value of c for which such roots exist.\n\nBut maybe the assumptions should be more succinct. Following the example where assumptions were listed as separate lines, each for one object. For example:\n\nAssumption:\nThe polynomial is defined as P(x) = x(x+1)(x+2)...(x+2009),\nThe equation P(x) = c is considered for some constant c,\nA root of the equation has multiplicity m.\n\nProblem:\nShow that m ≤ 2 for any root of the equation and find the value of c for which such roots exist.\n\nYes, that seems closer to the example. Each assumption is a separate line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nP(x) is defined as x(x+1)(x+2)...(x+2009),\nc is a constant,\na root of the equation P(x) = c has multiplicity m.\n\nProblem:\nShow that m ≤ 2 and find the value of c for which this is possible.\n\nI think that's the correct structure. The assumptions capture the polynomial, the equation with constant c, and the multiplicity m. The problem is to prove m is at most 2 and find c.",
