    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question according to the given format. Let me start by reading the original problem carefully. The title is \"How do you prove the p-norm is not a norm in R^n when 0 < p < 1?\" and the question elaborates that the user understands it fails the triangle inequality via an example but wants a general proof for all 0 < p < 1. The definition provided is the p-norm as the sum of |x_k|^p raised to 1/p.\n\nFirst, the task is to list the assumptions. Each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. Let me parse the problem:\n\n1. The setting is in R^n, so the vectors are in n-dimensional real space.\n2. The p-norm is defined as ||A||_p = (sum_{k=1}^n |x_k|^p)^{1/p}.\n3. The interval for p is 0 < p < 1. That's crucial because norms typically require p ≥ 1 to satisfy the triangle inequality.\n4. The problem is about proving that this p-norm is not a norm, specifically because it fails the triangle inequality for all p in (0,1).\n\nWait, the original problem mentions that the user has seen an example where the triangle inequality fails but wants to prove it for all 0 < p < 1. So the assumptions here are:\n\n- The vector space is R^n.\n- The function considered is the p-norm as defined.\n- The parameter p satisfies 0 < p < 1.\n\nThe problem is to show that under these conditions, the p-norm does not satisfy the triangle inequality, hence it's not a valid norm.\n\nLooking at the example provided in the user's instruction, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, which were listed as separate points. Here, the key assumptions are about the vector space, the definition of the p-norm, and the range of p. Each of these can be individual assumptions.\n\nSo, breaking it down:\n\nAssumptions:\n1. The vector space is ℝ^n (Euclidean n-dimensional space).\n2. The function ‖A‖ₚ is defined as (Σₖ=1ⁿ |xₖ|ᵖ )^(1/p).\n3. The parameter p satisfies 0 < p < 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that the p-norm ‖A‖ₚ is not a norm in ℝⁿ when 0 < p < 1.\n\nWait, but the user's example listed each assumption on a separate line. For instance, in the example, the assumptions were two separate points: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Here, perhaps each part of the problem's conditions should be separate. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- The space is ℝ^n.\n- The function ‖·‖ₚ is defined as (Σ |xₖ|ᵖ )^(1/p) for vectors in ℝⁿ.\n- The parameter p satisfies 0 < p < 1.\n\nBut maybe more accurately, since the problem is about the p-norm not being a norm in ℝⁿ for 0 < p <1, the key conditions are the definition of the p-norm and the range of p. The space being ℝⁿ is part of the problem's context. But to list each assumption as separate lines:\n\nAssumption:\n- The vector space under consideration is ℝⁿ.\n- The function ‖A‖ₚ is defined for a vector A = (x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ) as (∑ₖ=1ⁿ |xₖ|ᵖ )^(1/p).\n- The parameter p is a real number such that 0 < p < 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that ‖A‖ₚ is not a norm on ℝⁿ when 0 < p < 1.\n\nBut the problem's original title mentions that it's not a norm specifically because it fails the triangle inequality. So maybe the problem statement should specify that the triangle inequality fails. However, the user's example only mentioned the problem as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" without restating the reason (even though the original problem had that). So perhaps in the formatted problem, we just state the problem as given, but structured.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem should be phrased as \"Prove that the p-norm is not a norm on ℝⁿ when 0 < p < 1, i.e., it fails to satisfy the triangle inequality.\" But the original problem says \"prove the p-norm is not a norm...\", so maybe the problem statement is sufficient as is.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nThe vector space is ℝⁿ,\nThe function ‖A‖ₚ is defined as (∑ₖ=1ⁿ |xₖ|ᵖ )^(1/p),\nThe parameter p satisfies 0 < p < 1.\nProblem:\nProve that the p-norm ‖A‖ₚ is not a norm in ℝⁿ when 0 < p < 1.\n###",
