    "AcceptedAnswer": "We're gonna prove the focal property by proving that a tangent bisects the given angle.\nTo do that, we're gonna bisect the angle with a line and prove that this line is the tangent by showing that there are no other points that belong to the ellipse on that line. It is pretty obvious that for ellipse in one point there can be only one tangent. We do have the ellipse with foci $F_1$ and $F_2$ and a point $P$ on the ellipse curve.\nLet's have the line $k$ which is gonna be the bisector of the $F_2PF_2'$ angle.\nLet's extend a bit the ray $F_1P$ and place there a point $F_2'$ which is reflection of point $F_2$ in line $k$ .\nAs $F_2'$ is the reflection, $PF_1+PF_2'=F_1F_2'=const=2a$ where $2a$ is the major axis. If $k$ is the tangent, it intersects the ellipse in only one point which is $P$ but if it's not the tangent, there'll be a second point of intersection. Let's imagine a point $Q$ somewhere on the line $k$ . Similarly, $QF_2 = QF_2'$ and since $Q$ is on the ellipse, $F_1Q + QF_2'=const=2a$ . Therefore, $F_1Q+QF_2' = F_1F_2'$ but from the triangle's possibility condition (well, I'm not sure what it's called in English) $F_1Q+QF_2' > F_1F_2'$ hence there cannot exist a point Q that belongs both to the ellipse and line $k$ other than $P$ so the line $k$ is the only possible tangent in point $P$ . That implies that the angle between the focus and the tangent $k$ is equal to the angle between $k$ and the second focus. That is the focal property of ellipse. Little note 1: I forgot to hide point B on the image. It's useless.\nLittle note 2: The point $F_2'$ is called $F'$ on the image, my mistake again.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that the \"Assumption\" section lists each condition applied to one object, line by line. Then the \"Problem\" section states the actual question.\n\nFirst, I need to read the original problem carefully. The title is \"How to geometrically prove the focal property of ellipse?\" and the question is asking how to prove that the tangent at a point P on an ellipse bisects the angle between the lines joining one focus F to P and the other focus F' to P, but specifically the angle outside the ellipse. \n\nNow, I need to extract the assumptions. The key elements here are the ellipse, the two foci F and F', a point P on the ellipse, and the tangent line at P. The problem is about the tangent being an angle bisector. \n\nSo, the assumptions should list the properties or conditions given. Each assumption should be a single condition applied to one object. Let's see:\n\n1. The ellipse has two foci, F and F'. So, the first assumption could be \"The ellipse has two foci F and F'.\"\n2. The point P is on the ellipse. So, \"P is a point on the ellipse.\"\n3. The tangent at point P is considered. So, \"The tangent line at point P is considered.\"\n4. The tangent line is related to the angles formed by lines FP and F'P. Wait, the problem mentions the tangent is the bisector of the angle between FP and the line F'P outside the ellipse. But do I need to state that FP and F'P are lines from the foci to P? Or is that part of the problem? \n\nHmm, maybe the assumptions should just state the given conditions without including what needs to be proven. So, the problem is to prove that the tangent bisects that angle. Therefore, the assumptions are about the existence of the ellipse with two foci, a point on it, and the tangent at that point. The angle bisector part is what needs to be proven, not an assumption.\n\nSo, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The ellipse has two foci F and F'.\n- P is a point on the ellipse.\n- There is a tangent line to the ellipse at point P.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that this tangent bisects the angle formed between FP and F'P outside the ellipse.\n\nWait, the original question says \"the line F'P outside the ellipse\". Hmm, maybe that's a translation issue or phrasing. Probably, it's the angle between FP and the extension of F'P beyond the ellipse? Or the external angle? Maybe the problem is referring to the external angle, which is the angle outside the triangle formed by F, F', and P. But since both foci are inside the ellipse, the line F'P is from F' to P, which is inside the ellipse. But the tangent line is at P, so the angle between FP and F'P might be considered, but the tangent is supposed to bisect the angle between FP and the line from F'P outside. Maybe it's the external angle bisector? \n\nBut perhaps the user just wants to structure the problem as per the example. So the key points are the ellipse with two foci, a point P on it, and the tangent at P. The problem is to prove that the tangent bisects the angle between FP and F'P outside the ellipse. \n\nSo, translating that into the format:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The ellipse has two foci F and F'.\n- P is a point on the ellipse.\n- The tangent line at point P is considered.\n\nProblem: Prove that the tangent line at P bisects the angle between the lines FP and F'P outside the ellipse.\n\nWait, the original question says \"the line joining focus F to point P and the line F'P outside the ellipse\". Maybe it's the angle between FP and the external line from F'P? Or perhaps the angle formed by FP and the extension of F'P beyond P? Hmm, maybe the angle in question is the one formed by FP and the external angle, i.e., not the angle inside the ellipse but outside. But I think the standard focal property is that the tangent bisects the angle between the lines from the two foci to the point of contact, but in such a way that the angle is the external one. For example, in an ellipse, the reflection property states that the tangent line bisects the angle between the lines from a point on the ellipse to the two foci, but the angle that is bisected is the one \"outside\" the segment connecting the foci. Wait, actually, the reflection property is that the angle between the tangent and the line from one focus is equal to the angle between the tangent and the line from the other focus. But since both foci are on the same side of the tangent line, maybe the angle being referred to here is the external angle. \n\nBut regardless, the user's problem is to structure the question as per the example. So I need to list the assumptions and the problem. The original question is asking to prove that the tangent at P is the bisector of the angle between FP and F'P outside the ellipse. \n\nTherefore, the assumptions are the existence of the ellipse with foci F and F', point P on the ellipse, and the tangent at P. The problem is to prove the bisecting property. \n\nI think that's the correct breakdown. Let me check the example again. In the example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Then the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. So the assumptions are the conditions given, and the problem is the statement to prove. \n\nSimilarly, here, the assumptions are the ellipse has two foci, P is on the ellipse, and there's a tangent at P. The problem is to prove the tangent bisects the angle between FP and F'P outside the ellipse. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The ellipse has two foci F and F'.\n- P is a point on the ellipse.\n- The tangent line at point P is considered.\n\nProblem: Prove that the tangent line at P bisects the angle between FP and F'P outside the ellipse.\n\nI think that's correct. Each assumption is a single condition applied to one object. The problem is stated clearly. The mention of \"outside the ellipse\" is part of the problem statement, specifying which angle is being referred to.",
