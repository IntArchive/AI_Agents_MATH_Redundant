    "Content": "This seems to be a common result. I've been trying to follow the bijective proof of it, which can be found easily online, but the explanations go over my head. It would be wonderful if you could give me an understandable explanation of the proof and let me know how I'd go about finding such a bijection.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I'll give a sketch of the bijective proof; ask me if there's some part you don't understand and need fleshed out (or maybe someone else will post a detailed version). The important idea is that every number can be expressed uniquely as a power of 2 multiplied by an odd number. (Divide the number repeatedly by 2 till you get an odd number.) For instance, $120 = 2^3 \\times 15$ and $68 = 2^2 \\times 17$ and $81 = 2^0 \\times 81$. Odd parts -> Distinct parts Suppose you are given a partition of n into odd parts. Count the number of times each odd number occurs: suppose $1$ occurs $a_1$ times, similarly $3$ occurs $a_3$ times, etc. So\n$n = a_11 + a_33 + a_55 + \\cdots$. Now write each $a_i$ \"in binary\", i.e., as a sum of distinct powers of two. So you have\n$n =  (2^{b_{11}}+2^{b_{12}}+\\cdots)1 + (2^{b_{31}}+2^{b_{32}}+\\cdots)3 + \\cdots$. Now just get rid of the brackets, and note that all terms are distinct. (Why?) E.g. for $20 = 5+3+3+3+1+1+1+1+1+1$, which is a partition of $20$ into odd parts, we do $20 = (1)5 + (3)3 + (6)1$ $20 = (1)5 + (2+1)3 + (4+2)1$, so you get the partition $20 = 5 + 6 + 3 + 4 + 2$ in which all parts are distinct. Distinct parts -> Odd parts Given a partition into distinct parts, we can write each part as a power of 2 multiplied by an odd number, and collect the coefficients of each odd number, and write the odd number those many times, to get a partition into odd parts. So for example with $20 = 5+6+3+4+2$ which is a partition of $20$ into distinct parts, we write \n$20 = 5 + (2)3 + 3 + (4)1 + (2)1$, and then collect coefficients of the odd numbers $5$, $3$ and $1$: $20 = 5 + (2+1)3 + (4+2)1$ $20 = 5+3+3+3+1+1+1+1+1+1$, which was our original odd partition. Aside: you asked about the bijective proof, but I cannot resist mentioning that when Euler proved this theorem about partitions, it was with a proof that used generating functions. (When you understand both, maybe you can think about whether this proof is related to the bijective proof.) Sketch: Let $D(n)$ denote the number of partitions into distinct parts, and $O(n)$ denote the number of partitions into odd parts. Then we have: $$\n\\begin{align}\n\\sum_{n\\ge0}D(n)x^n &= (1+x)(1+x^2)(1+x^3)(1+x^4)(1+x^5)\\cdots \\\\\n&= \\frac{1-x^2}{1-x}\\frac{1-x^4}{1-x^2}\\frac{1-x^6}{1-x^3}\\frac{1-x^8}{1-x^4}\\frac{1-x^{10}}{1-x^5}\\cdots \\\\\n &= \\frac{1}{(1-x)(1-x^3)(1-x^5)\\cdots} \\\\\n &= (1+x+x^{1+1}+\\cdots)(1+x^3+x^{3+3}+\\cdots)(1+x^5+x^{5+5}+\\cdots) \\\\\n &= \\sum_{n\\ge0}O(n)x^n\n\\end{align}\n$$\nwhich proves the theorem.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to help structure this problem about partitions into distinct parts and partitions into odd parts. Let me start by understanding the original question.\n\nThe user mentions that the number of partitions of n into distinct parts equals the number of partitions of n into odd parts. They want an understandable explanation of the bijective proof and how to find such a bijection. The task is to format this problem according to the given example.\n\nLooking at the example, the Assumptions section lists each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. In the original problem, the example had an assumption that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. But here, the problem is more general. The main assumptions here would be about the partitions. Wait, but the problem itself is a statement that two sets of partitions are equal in number. So perhaps the assumptions are the conditions under which this holds. But the problem as stated is a theorem, so maybe the assumptions are the definitions involved.\n\nWait, the original problem didn't have assumptions in the theorem but had assumptions in the problem statement. For example, in the example, the problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91, with the assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But in this case, the problem is more general. The user is stating that the number of partitions of n into distinct parts equals the number into odd parts. So perhaps there are no additional assumptions beyond the definitions. Wait, but in the example, they had to extract assumptions from the problem. Let me think.\n\nThe problem is: The number of partitions of n into distinct parts equals the number of partitions of n into odd parts. The user is asking for a proof of this, specifically a bijective proof. So the problem is to prove this bijection. The assumptions would be the definitions involved. But the example had specific conditions on n. Here, perhaps the main assumption is that n is a positive integer, since partitions are defined for positive integers. Also, each partition into distinct parts means each part is unique, and partitions into odd parts means each part is an odd integer. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n1. n is a positive integer.\n2. A partition into distinct parts is a set of distinct positive integers summing to n.\n3. A partition into odd parts is a set of positive odd integers summing to n.\n\nBut the example had each assumption on one line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nPartitions into distinct parts are considered,\nPartitions into odd parts are considered.\n\nBut maybe the problem is stated as is, without needing to list the definitions as assumptions. Wait, in the example, the user had an original problem where the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7. The formatted problem listed those as assumptions. But in the current problem, the theorem is general for any n. So perhaps the only assumption is that n is a positive integer. Because partitions are defined for positive integers. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that the number of partitions of n into distinct parts equals the number of partitions of n into odd parts.\n\nBut the original problem mentions \"the number of partitions of n into distinct parts equals the number of partitions of n into odd parts\". So the problem is to prove that equality. The user is asking for a bijective proof. So in the formatted problem, the problem statement would be to prove that equality. The assumptions would be the conditions required for the theorem to hold, which is just that n is a positive integer, as partitions are defined for positive integers. So I think that's the main assumption here. Let me check the example again. In the example, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7. So here, the analogous assumption would be that n is a positive integer. The other parts (distinct parts, odd parts) are part of the problem statement, not assumptions. So I think the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that the number of partitions of n into distinct parts equals the number of partitions of n into odd parts.\n\nThat seems to fit the example's structure. The example extracted specific conditions (n is integer, n divisible by 7) from the problem. Here, the key condition is that n is a positive integer. The rest are part of the problem statement. So that should be the correct formatting.",
