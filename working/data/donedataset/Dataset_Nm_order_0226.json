    "Content": "Today, I encountered a rather interesting problem in a waiting room: $\\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad$ Notice how the light is being cast on the wall?  There is a curve that defines the boundary between light and shadow.  In my response below, I will prove, algebraically, that this curve is a hyperbola.  I'm also interested in seeing a variety of other solutions, so please feel free to post your own.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Oh... this question was my homework a year ago, and this is my proof which is short as per my laziness. The bad grey drawing is the locus required. Obviously, for this part the light rays just touch the plate. Now $$\\dfrac{PA}{PD}=\\dfrac{CA}{CB}=\\text{constant}>1$$ Hence, the locus is a hyperbola as ratio of distance from the top of candle and line of candle(extended) is ... This case is similar to the lamp except the fact that there is darkness below and light above the boundary as contrary to a lamp. But this has no effect on the boundary.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange problem into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object, and then the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the original problem from the user: the title is \"Lampshade Geometry Problem\". The question describes a scenario where the light from a lampshade casts a shadow on the wall, and the boundary between light and shadow forms a curve. The user (the original poster) mentions they proved it's a hyperbola algebraically and invites others to post solutions.\n\nNow, the task is to extract the assumptions and the problem. The example given for the divisibility problem had assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. But in this lampshade problem, the original question doesn't explicitly state many assumptions. So I need to infer the necessary assumptions based on typical geometry problems involving light and shadows, especially leading to a hyperbola.\n\nCommon assumptions for such problems might include:\n\n1. The light source is a point light.\n2. The lampshade is cylindrical or has a circular opening.\n3. The wall is a flat plane.\n4. The light is casting a shadow from the edge of the lampshade.\n5. The position of the light source relative to the lampshade and the wall.\n\nBut the original problem doesn't specify these details. The user just mentions the curve between light and shadow and wants to prove it's a hyperbola. However, to form the problem properly, we need to list the assumptions that are implicit in the scenario. Since the problem is about proving the curve is a hyperbola, the assumptions would relate to the setup that leads to a hyperbola, such as the light source's position, the shape of the lampshade, and the orientation of the wall.\n\nWait, but the user's example in the original query had the formatted problem with an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, but in the original problem, it was stated \"for every integer n\". So maybe the example is a bad one? Because the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7, but the formatted problem added it. Wait, no, looking back: the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" Then in the formatted problem, the assumption was n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. Formatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But wait, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Maybe the user made a mistake in the example, or perhaps the original problem was different. Wait, perhaps there's a confusion here. But the user provided that example as how they want the format to be. So maybe in the example, the original problem had a mistake, and the formatted problem corrected it? Or perhaps it's a typo. Anyway, perhaps the user wants to extract the assumptions from the problem as stated, even if they are redundant. For instance, in the example, the problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is \"n is an integer\", and then another assumption \"n is divisible by 7\", which might not be in the original problem. Wait, that seems conflicting. Hmm, maybe the user's example is incorrect, but I need to follow their format regardless.\n\nBut moving back to the lampshade problem. The original question mentions that the curve is a hyperbola, and the user proved it algebraically. The problem is to prove that the boundary is a hyperbola. So the assumptions would be about the setup leading to that conclusion.\n\nTypical assumptions for such a problem might include:\n\n- The lampshade is a circular cylinder.\n- The light source is located at a point not on the axis of the cylinder.\n- The wall is a plane perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder.\n- The light source, lampshade, and wall are positioned such that the shadow is cast.\n\nAlternatively, if the lampshade is a cone, but the problem states it's a hyperbola, which arises from a conic section when the light source is positioned such that the plane cuts both nappes of the cone. But in the case of a cylinder, a hyperbola can be formed if the light source is positioned in a certain way.\n\nBut since the problem states that the boundary is a hyperbola, the assumptions need to set up the conditions for that. So the key assumptions are about the shape of the lampshade, the position of the light source, and the orientation of the wall.\n\nSince the original problem doesn't specify these, but the answerer (the original poster) proved it's a hyperbola, we need to infer the necessary assumptions from typical problems of this nature. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe lampshade is a right circular cylinder.\nThe light source is a point located outside the cylinder.\nThe wall is a plane not parallel to the cylinder's axis.\nThe shadow is formed by the light source casting the edge of the cylinder onto the wall.\n\nBut maybe the problem assumes a specific orientation. Alternatively, maybe the lampshade is a cylindrical tube, and the light is coming from a point source, causing the shadow boundary to be a hyperbola.\n\nAlternatively, another common setup is that the lampshade is a cone, and the light is coming from the tip, but that would project a different curve. However, the hyperbola comes when the intersecting plane is not parallel to the cone's side and cuts through both nappes. But perhaps in the lampshade problem, it's a cylinder, and the light source is positioned such that the shadow on the wall forms a hyperbola.\n\nGiven that the original problem is from a user who has already solved it and knows it's a hyperbola, the assumptions are likely about the cylindrical shape of the lampshade, the point light source, and the wall's position.\n\nTherefore, structuring the problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The lampshade is a right circular cylinder.\n- The light source is a point located at a finite distance from the cylinder.\n- The wall is a flat plane.\n- The light source, cylinder, and wall are positioned such that the shadow boundary is formed by the projection of the cylinder's edge.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the curve defining the boundary between light and shadow on the wall is a hyperbola.\n\nBut wait, the original problem didn't mention the cylinder, but the user's answer refers to proving it algebraically. Maybe the lampshade is assumed to be a certain shape. But since the problem as stated in the question doesn't specify, perhaps the assumptions should only include what's given. But the original problem says \"Notice how the light is being cast on the wall? There is a curve that defines the boundary between light and shadow.\" So the problem is to prove that this curve is a hyperbola.\n\nHowever, the user has to make certain geometric assumptions to model the problem. Since the user (original poster) proved it's a hyperbola, they must have made certain assumptions about the setup. Therefore, the task is to extract those assumptions from the problem statement. But the problem statement as given in the question is very brief. It just mentions a lampshade casting light with a boundary curve, and the answerer proved it's a hyperbola. So perhaps the necessary assumptions are about the lampshade being a circular cylinder, the light source being a point, and the wall being a plane. But since the problem statement doesn't explicitly state these, perhaps the answer should list the minimal assumptions needed to model the problem such that the curve is a hyperbola.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is a classic one where the lampshade is a cylinder and the light is coming from a point, leading to the shadow being a hyperbola. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The lampshade is a right circular cylinder.\n- The light source is a point located on the cylinder's axis.\n- The wall is a plane perpendicular to the cylinder's axis.\n\nWait, but if the light is on the axis and the wall is perpendicular, the shadow might be a circle. So maybe the light is off the axis. Let me think again.\n\nIf the lampshade is a cylinder and the light source is not on the axis, then the shadow on a wall would form a hyperbola. For example, if you have a cylinder and a point light source off the axis, the intersection of the light rays with the wall (which is a plane) would form a conic section. Depending on the angle, it could be a hyperbola.\n\nTherefore, assumptions needed:\n\n- The lampshade is a right circular cylinder.\n- The light source is a point not lying on the cylinder's axis.\n- The wall is a plane not parallel to the cylinder's axis.\n- The boundary curve is formed by the projection of the cylinder's rim from the light source onto the wall.\n\nWith these assumptions, the problem becomes proving the curve is a hyperbola.\n\nBut since the original problem didn't specify these details, perhaps the answer should include those assumptions that are standard in such geometric problems.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the lampshade is a cone. But the hyperbola comes from a cone intersected by a plane. However, in the case of a lampshade, it's more likely to be a cylinder. But I'm not sure. However, given that the answer is a hyperbola, the setup must involve a scenario where the intersection is a hyperbola.\n\nIn any case, the formatted problem should list assumptions that are necessary for the proof. Since the original problem statement is sparse, the assistant must infer typical assumptions made in such problems. So, the answer would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe lampshade is a right circular cylinder.\nThe light source is a point located outside the cylinder.\nThe wall is a flat plane.\nThe boundary between light and shadow is formed by the projection of the cylinder's edge.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the curve defining the boundary between light and shadow on the wall is a hyperbola.\n\nBut I need to check each assumption addresses only one property or condition of one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe lampshade is a right circular cylinder.\nThe light source is a point located at a position not on the cylinder's central axis.\nThe wall is a flat plane oriented at an angle relative to the cylinder's axis.\nThe edge of the lampshade is a circle perpendicular to the cylinder's axis.\nThe light rays emanate from the point source in straight lines.\n\nEach of these addresses one property. Then the problem is to prove the curve is a hyperbola.\n\nBut perhaps the original problem didn't mention the orientation of the wall, so maybe the wall is perpendicular to the axis? If the wall is perpendicular, and the light is off-axis, then the shadow would be a circle if the light is on the axis, but a conic section otherwise. So perhaps the wall is not perpendicular, leading to a hyperbola.\n\nAlternatively, if the wall is parallel to the axis, but the light is off-axis, then it's a hyperbola.\n\nThis requires some knowledge of conic sections as projections. The key is that the intersection of a plane with a cone can be a hyperbola, but in this case, it's the projection from a point, so it's similar to a conic section.\n\nIn any case, the formatted assumptions should be each one line, one property. So the final answer would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nThe lampshade is a right circular cylinder.\nThe light source is a point located outside the cylinder.\nThe wall is a flat plane not parallel to the cylinder's axis.\nThe boundary between light and shadow is formed by projecting the lampshade's circular edge onto the wall via the light source.\nProblem: \nProve that the curve defining the boundary between light and shadow is a hyperbola.",
