    "Content": "How to prove $f(x)=x^8-24 x^6+144 x^4-288 x^2+144$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$? I tried Eisenstein criteria on $f(x+n)$ with $n$ ranging from $-10$ to $10$. None can be applied. I tried factoring over mod $p$ for primes up to $1223$. $f(x)$ is always reducible over these. $f(x)$ has roots $\\pm\\sqrt{\\left(2\\pm\\sqrt{2}\\right) \\left(3\\pm\\sqrt{3}\\right)}$, and according to computation by PARI, should have Galois group isomorphic to the quaternion group. The splitting field of $f(x)$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\left(2+\\sqrt{2}\\right) \\left(3+\\sqrt{3}\\right)})$, and it contains $\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{6}$, so we know $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3})$ is in the splitting field, so $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\left(2+\\sqrt{2}\\right) \\left(3+\\sqrt{3}\\right)})$ has degree $4$ or $8$. I tried showing the degree is $8$ by showing that $(a+b\\sqrt{2}+c\\sqrt{3}+d\\sqrt{6})^2=(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$ cannot have a solution with $a, b, c, d \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, and got these equations:\n$$a^2+2b^2+3c^2+6d^2=6$$\n$$2ab + 6cd = 3$$\n$$ac+2bd = 1$$\n$$2ad+2bc = 1$$\nwhich I'm unable to handle. Addendum: now that I've solved this problem thanks to the answers, I found some additional related information: In A Rational Polynomial whose Group is the Quaternions , a very similar polynomial, $$f(x)=x^8 - 72 x^6 + 180 x^4 - 144 x^2 + 36$$ is studied and its Galois group is proven to be the quaternion group. I subjected this polynomial, as well as two related ones: $f(\\sqrt{x})$, $f(6\\sqrt{x})/36$, to the same battery of tests (Eisenstein; mod p) and these tests also failed to show them to be irreducible. Maybe there's something common about these polynomials. So I subjected $f(x)$ to the prime numbers test demonstrated by Robert Israel, and found that it is prime at $\\pm\\{7, 13, 23, 25, 49, 53, 55, 79, 91, 127, 139, 145, 151, 181, 239, 251, 277, 283, 319, 355, 379, 403, 413, 425, 473, 485, 595, 607, 623, 679, 733, 743, 779, 827, 851, 923, 965, ...\\}$ and thus $f(x)$ is irreducible.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Your polynomial $f(x)$ takes prime (or $-$ prime) values at $x = \\pm 1, \\pm 7, \\pm 11, \\pm 13, \\pm 23, \\pm 67, \\pm 85, \\pm 109, \\pm 145, \\pm 197, \\pm 205, \\pm 209, \\pm 241, \\pm 373, \\pm 397, \\pm 403, \\pm 421$.  That's $34$ points.  If it factored as $f(x)=g(x) h(x)$, one of $g$ and $h$ must be $\\pm 1$ at at least $17$ of these $x$, and either $+1$ at at least $9$ points or $-1$ at at least $9$ points.  But a non-constant polynomial that takes the same value at $9$ points must have degree at least $9$, and $f$ has degree only $8$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The goal is to prove that the polynomial f(x) = x^8 - 24x^6 + 144x^4 - 288x^2 + 144 is irreducible over the rational numbers, ℚ. \n\nFirst, the user mentioned they tried Eisenstein's criterion on f(x + n) for n from -10 to 10, but none worked. Eisenstein is a common method to check irreducibility, but if shifting the polynomial doesn't yield a prime that divides all coefficients except the leading one and whose square doesn't divide the constant term, then Eisenstein doesn't apply. So, they had to look for other methods.\n\nThey also tried factoring modulo primes up to 1223 and found that f(x) is always reducible. That's interesting because if a polynomial is irreducible over ℚ, it should be irreducible modulo p for some prime p (contrapositive of reduction mod p theorem). But here, reducible modulo all primes tried. Wait, but maybe the Galois group here is such that modulo any prime, the polynomial factors. But the user says f(x) is reducible over these mod p. However, the converse isn't necessarily true; reducibility mod p for some p implies reducibility over ℚ, but irreducibility over ℚ doesn't require irreducibility mod any p. But if it's reducible mod every p, that's possible. For example, cyclotomic polynomials can factor modulo every prime. But in this case, maybe the polynomial has roots that can be constructed in such a way that modulo any prime, it splits into factors. Hmm.\n\nThe user then mentions the roots are ±√[(2±√2)(3±√3)]. Let me compute that. So, each root is a square root of a product of terms involving √2 and √3. The splitting field is given as ℚ(√[(2+√2)(3+√3)]), and it contains √2, √3, √6. So, the splitting field includes ℚ(√2, √3), which has degree 4 over ℚ. The user is trying to determine if the splitting field has degree 4 or 8 over ℚ. If it's 8, then the polynomial is irreducible, as the degree of the splitting field over ℚ would be 8, implying that the polynomial has an irreducible factor of degree 8.\n\nThe user attempted to show that the minimal polynomial of √[(2+√2)(3+√3)] has degree 8 over ℚ by assuming that this element can be written as a + b√2 + c√3 + d√6 with a, b, c, d ∈ ℚ, and then squared it to get equations. They ended up with four equations:\n\n1. a² + 2b² + 3c² + 6d² = 6\n2. 2ab + 6cd = 3\n3. ac + 2bd = 1\n4. 2ad + 2bc = 1\n\nThese equations are supposed to have no rational solutions, which would imply that the element cannot be expressed in ℚ(√2, √3), hence the degree is 8. But the user couldn't solve these equations. \n\nThen, the user mentions that they solved the problem with the help of answers, which involved checking that the polynomial takes prime values at certain integers. Robert Israel's method: If a polynomial f(x) evaluated at some integer x gives a prime number, then f(x) is irreducible over ℚ. Because if it factored into lower-degree polynomials, then plugging in an integer x would result in a composite number (product of integers). So, if f(n) is prime for some integer n, then f is irreducible. \n\nThe user tested this and found that f(x) is prime for several integer values of x, such as ±7, 13, 23, etc. Thus, by this primality test, f(x) must be irreducible. \n\nAdditionally, the user compared this polynomial to another one from a reference, which has a Galois group isomorphic to the quaternion group. The quaternion group has order 8, which is non-abelian, so the splitting field must have degree 8 over ℚ, confirming that the polynomial is irreducible. \n\nSo, to structure the problem according to the given format, we need to list the assumptions and the problem statement. The original problem is to prove the polynomial is irreducible over ℚ. The assumptions would include the structure of the roots, the splitting field containing ℚ(√2, √3), and perhaps the fact that f(x) takes prime values at certain integers. But the example given in the user's previous formatting seems to extract specific assumptions from the problem. \n\nLooking at the example provided: The original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". But the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that might be a mistake. Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Maybe there was a mistake in the example. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to show filtering out unrelated information, but the example might be flawed. However, following the user's instruction, the task is to filter out unrelated information and structure the problem with assumptions and problem statement.\n\nIn the current problem, the user tried various methods (Eisenstein, mod p), but those are part of their attempt, not assumptions of the problem. The problem's own assumptions are the polynomial's coefficients, perhaps the roots given, and the properties of the splitting field. However, the core problem is to prove irreducibility over ℚ. The problem as stated in the title is the main question. So, in the formatted problem, the assumptions would be the given polynomial, and perhaps any inherent properties (like coefficients being integers, which is inherent in being over ℚ). But the example shows that assumptions are conditions given in the problem. Wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which was converted into \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, but also added \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, that example seems incorrect. The original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. So perhaps the user intended to structure assumptions as the conditions given in the problem. Maybe there was a miscommunication in the example.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user is asking to structure the problem as per the format. The original problem is \"Prove f(x)=x^8-24 x^6+144 x^4-288 x^2+144 is irreducible over ℚ\". The user's own attempts include trying Eisenstein, factoring mod p, etc., but those are not part of the problem's assumptions. The problem itself doesn't state any assumptions beyond the polynomial given. However, the user mentions roots and splitting field, but those are part of their exploration, not given in the problem. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement includes that the polynomial is as given, which is the main assumption. So the assumption is that f(x) is the given polynomial. But the example had multiple assumptions. Maybe the assumptions here are:\n\n- f(x) is defined as x^8 -24x^6 +144x^4 -288x^2 +144\n\nBut the example had two assumptions, but in that case, maybe the original problem had two conditions. Wait, the original example problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, and the formatted problem added that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But that seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. Because if the original problem is \"for every integer n\", then the assumption should just be \"n is an integer\". Adding \"n is divisible by 7\" would restrict it, but the problem is to prove it for all integers. Therefore, the example seems incorrectly formatted, but following the user's instruction, we need to follow their format.\n\nIn the current problem, perhaps the assumptions would be the polynomial's coefficients and the field over which we are considering (ℚ). But the problem is to prove irreducibility over ℚ, so the main assumption is the polynomial's expression. Hence, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) = x^8 -24x^6 +144x^4 -288x^2 +144\n\nProblem:\nProve that f(x) is irreducible over ℚ.\n\nBut the user's example added assumptions beyond the problem's statement. Wait, the original example problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" The formatted assumptions were \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" But the original problem didn't say n is divisible by 7; it said for every integer n. So this seems like a mistake. Hence, perhaps the user's example is incorrect, and we should not follow that. Instead, the correct way would be to list the inherent assumptions in the problem. For the current problem, the only assumption is the polynomial's definition, and the problem is to prove its irreducibility over ℚ.\n\nBut the user's example added an extra assumption that wasn't in the original problem. Maybe there was a miscommunication. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to filter out unrelated information and list all the necessary assumptions. For instance, in the original problem, if the user mentioned that the polynomial has certain roots or properties, those might be part of the assumptions. However, in the current problem, the user's question includes various attempts and information, but the actual problem is just to prove irreducibility. The roots and splitting field are part of their reasoning, not the problem's given conditions. So, the problem as posed is just to prove the polynomial is irreducible over ℚ, with the only assumption being the polynomial's expression.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) = x^8 -24x^6 +144x^4 -288x^2 +144\n\nProblem:\nProve that f(x) is irreducible over ℚ.\n\nBut in the user's example, they included additional assumptions from the problem's conditions. Wait, the original example's problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, and the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". The latter wasn't in the original problem. That suggests that perhaps the user wants to extract implicit assumptions. But that might not be correct. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in their example. Given that, perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions should include the given polynomial and any inherent properties mentioned in the problem. However, the problem as posed in the title is just the polynomial and the requirement to prove irreducibility. All other information (roots, Galois group, etc.) are part of the user's attempts or additional context, not part of the problem's assumptions. Therefore, the formatted problem should list the polynomial as the assumption and the problem as proving irreducibility over ℚ.",
