    "Content": "Let $K$ be a field, and $a_1,\\dots,a_n \\in K$. Prove that the ideal $$(X_1-a_1,\\dots,X_n-a_n)$$ is maximal in $K[X_1,\\dots,X_n]$. I tried proving that the only elements outside the ideal are the invertibles of $K$ (I should still prove that this implies maximality, but it shouldn't be too difficult). Is there a better strategy, or another stategy?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The question is to prove that the ideal (X₁ - a₁, ..., Xₙ - aₙ) is maximal in the polynomial ring K[X₁, ..., Xₙ], where K is a field and a₁, ..., aₙ are elements of K.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a maximal ideal is. A maximal ideal is an ideal that is not contained in any other ideal except the entire ring itself. So, to show that this ideal is maximal, I need to demonstrate that there's no other ideal that properly contains it unless it's the whole ring.\n\nThe user mentioned trying to prove that the only elements outside the ideal are invertible, which would imply that the ideal is maximal because if every element not in the ideal is a unit, then the ideal can't be contained in a larger proper ideal. But maybe there's a different approach.\n\nAnother strategy that comes to mind is using the First Isomorphism Theorem. If we can construct a surjective homomorphism from K[X₁, ..., Xₙ] to another ring (preferably a field) such that the kernel of this homomorphism is exactly the ideal in question, then by the First Isomorphism Theorem, the quotient ring K[X₁, ..., Xₙ]/I would be isomorphic to the field. Since the quotient by an ideal is a field if and only if the ideal is maximal, this would prove the result.\n\nSo, let's try that. Define a homomorphism φ: K[X₁, ..., Xₙ] → K by evaluating each polynomial at the point (a₁, ..., aₙ). That is, φ(f) = f(a₁, ..., aₙ). This makes sense because K is a field, and evaluating a polynomial at a point gives an element of K.\n\nFirst, check that φ is indeed a ring homomorphism. It preserves addition and multiplication because evaluating a sum or product of polynomials at a point is the same as summing or multiplying their evaluations. The kernel of φ is the set of all polynomials f such that f(a₁, ..., aₙ) = 0. That's exactly the ideal I = (X₁ - a₁, ..., Xₙ - aₙ), because any polynomial in I vanishes at (a₁, ..., aₙ), and conversely, any polynomial vanishing at that point can be written in terms of (Xᵢ - aᵢ) by the factor theorem (in multiple variables).\n\nNow, φ is surjective because for any c ∈ K, the constant polynomial c is mapped to c. Hence, the image is all of K. By the First Isomorphism Theorem, K[X₁, ..., Xₙ]/I ≅ K. Since K is a field, the quotient ring is a field, which implies that I is a maximal ideal.\n\nWait, but I should verify if the kernel is indeed I. Suppose f is in the kernel, so f(a₁, ..., aₙ) = 0. Can we express f as a combination of (Xᵢ - aᵢ)? In the single-variable case, this is straightforward by the factor theorem: f(X) = (X - a)q(X). For multiple variables, it's similar but requires induction. For example, in two variables, we can write f(X, Y) as (X - a)g(X, Y) + h(Y), then evaluate X = a, so h(Y) must vanish at Y = b, hence h(Y) = (Y - b)k(Y), so f is in (X - a, Y - b). This generalizes to n variables, so the kernel is indeed I.\n\nTherefore, this approach works. Alternatively, the user might consider showing that any proper ideal containing I would have to include invertible elements, which is impossible, hence I is maximal. But the quotient approach seems more straightforward.\n\nI also need to check if there are any assumptions I missed. The problem states K is a field, and a₁, ..., aₙ are elements of K. The ideal is generated by linear polynomials. There's no mention of any restrictions on K, like being algebraically closed or something else. So the key assumptions are that K is a field and the a_i are in K. The problem is to show the ideal is maximal.\n\nSo, putting this into the required format, the assumptions are each listed per line, each addressing one condition. The problem is to prove the ideal is maximal.",
