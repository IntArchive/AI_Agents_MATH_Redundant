    "Content": "Let $f$ be defined on $[a,b]$ and there differentiable. Show that for every $ \\epsilon>0 $ there exists a partition $\\, a=a_0<a_1<...<a_n=b \\,$ of $ \\,[a,b] \\,$ so that $$\\left|\\frac {f(a_{i+1})-f(a_i)}{a_{i+1}-a_i}-f'(a_i) \\right|<\\epsilon\\qquad(i=0,...,n-1)$$\nThis proof was left as an exercise to the Belgian mathematician P.Gilbert by G.Peano in a quarrel (1884) about a mistake made by C.Jordan in his Cours d'analyse vol.1 (1882). According to Peano, Jordan's proof of the mean value inequality theorem presented a fallacious argument: Gilbert did not agree. See nice pp. 12-14. Can someone give her/his own proof ?

    "AcceptedAnswer": "Note that by choosing $x=a_{n-1}$, Peano's theorem has the following immediate consequence, for any $a < b$ and $\\epsilon > 0$. Lemma 1: If $f\\colon[a,b]\\to\\mathbb{R}$ is differentiable, then there exists $x\\in[a,b)$ satisfying\n$$\n\\left\\lvert\\frac{f(b)-f(x)}{b-x}-f^\\prime(x)\\right\\rvert\\lt\\epsilon.\n$$ This lemma is obviously true for continuously differentiable functions simply by taking $x$ to be close enough to $b$. For functions with non-continuous derivatives, however, things are more difficult, and the inequality can fail for $x$ arbitrarily close to $b$. Starting with this lemma, we can also go in the opposite direction, and prove Peano's theorem, which I will do now. I'll also give a proof of the Lemma, showing that Peano's theorem is indeed true. First, the natural way to try and prove Peano's theorem is to start with $a_0$ and then inductively choose values for $a_1,a_2,\\ldots$. Once $a_i$ has been chosen then, if $a_i=b$ we are done. If not then, by the definition of the derivative of $f$ at $a_i$, there does exist $a_{i+1}\\in(a_i,b]$ satisfying the required inequality. In order to maximise the chance of covering the interval $[a,b]$ in a finite number of steps, it would seem to be prudent to choose $a_{i+1}$ as large as possible and $a_{i+1}=b$ if possible. Unfortunately, this approach does not always work, and it is possible that you just end up generating an infinite increasing sequence $a_i$ in the interval $[a,b)$. A method that does succeed is to, instead, work from the right to the left. That is, start by choosing $b_0=b$ and inductive define a decreasing sequence $b_0\\gt b_1\\gt b_2\\gt\\cdots\\gt b_n=a$ such that\n$$\n\\left\\lvert\\frac{f(b_i)-f(b_{i+1})}{b_i-b_{i+1}}-f^\\prime(b_{i+1})\\right\\rvert\\lt\\epsilon.\n$$\nThen Peano's theorem follows by taking $a_i=b_{n-i}$. If, for any $x\\in(a,b]$ we let $S_x$ be the set of $y\\in[a,x)$ with $\\lvert(f(x)-f(y))/(x-y)-f^\\prime(y)\\rvert\\lt\\epsilon$ then, Lemma 1 applied to the interval $[a,x]$ says that $S_x$ is nonempty. Choosing a sequence $\\delta_0,\\delta_1,\\ldots$ of positive reals tending to zero, select $b_0,b_1,\\ldots$ as follows. $b_0=b$. Once $b_i$ has been chosen, if $b_i > a$ then take $b_{i+1}\\in S_{b_i}$ with $b_{i+1}\\le\\inf S_{b_i}+\\delta_i$. If possible, choose $b_{i+1}=a$. If $b_i=a$ then we are done. Note that, as Lemma 1 implies that $S_{b_i}$ is non-empty whenever $b_i > a$, then this process continues either indefinitely or until $b_i=a$. Lemma 2: The sequence $\\{b_i\\}$ terminates with $b_n=a$ for some $n$. Proof: (Note: This proof will assume Lemma 1) Using proof by contradiction, suppose that the sequence $b_0,b_1,\\ldots$ does not terminate. In this case, it decreases to a limit $c\\in[a,b)$. If $c=a$ then, by the definition of the derivative at $a$, we have $\\lvert (f(b_i)-f(a))/(b_i-a)-f^\\prime(a)\\rvert\\lt\\epsilon$ for large $i$. By the procedure above, we would choose $b_{i+1}=a$ and the sequence terminates, contradicting the assumption. If $c > a$ then, using Lemma 1 applied to the interval $[a,c]$, there exists an $x\\in[a,c)$ with $\\lvert(f(c)-f(x))/(c-x)-f^\\prime(x)\\rvert\\lt\\epsilon$. By the continuity of $f$ at $c$, we have $\\lvert(f(b_i)-f(x))/(b_i-x)-f^\\prime(x)\\rvert\\lt\\epsilon$ for all large $i$, so $x\\in S_{b_i}$. By the procedure above, we choose $b_{i+1}\\lt x + \\delta_i$. Taking $i$ large enough that $\\delta_i\\le c-x$ this gives $b_{i+1}\\lt c$, contradicting the property that $b_i$ decreases to $c$. QED To finish off the post: Proof of Lemma 1: By the definition of the derivative at $b$, there exists $\\delta\\gt0$ such that $\\lvert(f(b)-f(x))/(b-x)-f^\\prime(b)\\rvert\\lt\\epsilon/2$ whenever $x\\gt b-\\delta$. Choosing $y\\in[a,b)$ with $y\\gt b-\\delta$, applying the mean value theorem gives $x\\in(y,b)$ such that $f^\\prime(x)=(f(b)-f(y))/(b-y)$. Then,\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\left\\lvert\\frac{f(b)-f(x)}{b-x}-f^\\prime(x)\\right\\rvert\n&=\n\\left\\lvert\\frac{f(b)-f(x)}{b-x}-\\frac{f(b)-f(y)}{b-y}\\right\\rvert\\cr\n&\\le\n\\left\\lvert\\frac{f(b)-f(x)}{b-x}-f^\\prime(b)\\right\\rvert\n+\n\\left\\lvert\\frac{f(b)-f(y)}{b-y}-f^\\prime(b)\\right\\rvert\\cr\n&\\lt\\epsilon/2+\\epsilon/2=\\epsilon.\n\\end{align}\n$$ QED So, Peano's theorem is true. However, I made use of the mean value theorem in the proof of Lemma 1, so this does not give a method of proving the mean value inequality. That would be circular. The real problem is to prove Peano's theorem without making use of anything as strong as the mean value inequality. However, in my opinion, Peano's theorem is more difficult to prove than the MVT (or an approximate form of it), so does not give a useful step in proving the mean value inequality.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. The example provided shows how assumptions and the problem are separated. \n\nLooking at the original problem: It's about proving that for every ε > 0, there exists a partition of [a, b] such that the absolute difference between the difference quotient and the derivative at each subinterval's left endpoint is less than ε. \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The function f is defined on [a, b] and differentiable there. So the assumptions should mention the domain of f and its differentiability. However, the original problem states \"there differentiable,\" which probably means differentiable on the entire interval [a, b]. \n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n- f is defined on the interval [a, b].\n- f is differentiable on [a, b].\n\nThen the problem is to show for every ε > 0, such a partition exists with the given condition.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumptions included specific conditions on n. Here, the problem doesn't have extra conditions beyond f being defined and differentiable on [a, b]. So I should list those two as separate assumptions. Each assumption addresses one property of one object. So f being defined on [a,b] is one, differentiable there is another. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other hidden assumptions. The problem doesn't mention continuity because differentiability implies continuity, so maybe that's covered. But according to the instructions, each assumption should be listed even if implied, as long as stated in the original problem. The original says \"defined on [a,b] and there differentiable,\" so two separate conditions. \n\nThus, the formatted problem should have two assumptions and then the problem statement. Let me check the example again. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here similarly, two assumptions for f. \n\nSo, the final formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is defined on the interval [a, b],\nf is differentiable on [a, b].\nProblem:\nShow that for every ε > 0, there exists a partition a = a₀ < a₁ < ... < aₙ = b of [a, b] such that for each i = 0, ..., n−1, the inequality |(f(a_{i+1}) − f(a_i))/(a_{i+1} − a_i) − f’(a_i)| < ε holds.\n\nYes, that seems to capture all the necessary parts. The problem mentions the function is defined on [a,b] and differentiable there, so those are the two assumptions. The problem statement is about finding the partition for any epsilon > 0. I don't see any other conditions or objects in the original problem, so this should be correct.",
