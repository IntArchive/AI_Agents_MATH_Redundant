    "Content": "It is well known that $$\\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac {\\sin(x)}{x} = 1$$ I know several proofs of this: the geometric proof shows that $\\cos(\\theta)\\leq\\frac {\\sin(\\theta)}{\\theta}\\leq1$ and using the Squeeze Theorem I conclude that $\\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac {\\sin(x)}{x} = 1$, other proof uses the Maclaurin series of $\\sin(x)$. My question is: is there a demonstration of this limit using the epsilon-delta definition of limit?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here is a more direct answer for this: Since $\\cos\\theta<\\frac{\\sin\\theta}{\\theta}<1$ , one can get $$\\bigg|\\frac{\\sin\\theta}{\\theta}-1\\bigg|<1-\\cos\\theta.$$ Since $1-\\cos\\theta=2\\sin^2\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\le\\frac{\\theta^2}{2}$ ,  hence $$\\bigg|\\frac{\\sin\\theta}{\\theta}-1\\bigg|\\le\\frac{\\theta^2}{2}.$$ Now it is easy to use $\\varepsilon-\\delta$ definition to get the answer.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's start by understanding the problem. The user wants to prove that the limit of sin(x)/x as x approaches 0 is 1 using the epsilon-delta definition. I need to structure this problem according to the specified format.\n\nFirst, I'll list the assumptions. The main object here is x approaching 0. The key conditions are that x is approaching 0, and we need to use the epsilon-delta definition. However, the problem statement doesn't mention any specific constraints on x other than it approaching 0. The original question mentions using the epsilon-delta definition, so that's a method condition. There might be an implicit assumption that x is measured in radians since the limit result is typically stated in radians. Also, x is not zero because we're dividing by x. Let me check the example given earlier. The example included assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" So each assumption is a single condition on one object.\n\nSo, the assumptions here would be:\n- x approaches 0 (the limit point)\n- x is measured in radians (since otherwise, the limit would be different if in degrees)\n- x is not equal to 0 (to avoid division by zero)\n- The proof must use the epsilon-delta definition of a limit (as per the question's requirement)\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumptions were about the problem's conditions, not the method. The method (using epsilon-delta) is part of the problem statement. The user is asking for a demonstration using epsilon-delta, so maybe that's part of the problem, not an assumption. Let me re-examine the example. In the example, the original problem had a divisibility by 91, but the user structured the assumption as n being an integer and n divisible by 7. So the assumptions are the given conditions of the problem. The problem part is what needs to be proven. \n\nIn this case, the problem is to prove the limit using epsilon-delta. So the assumptions are the conditions under which the problem is posed. For the limit, the assumptions would be that x is approaching 0, x is in radians, and x ≠ 0. The method (epsilon-delta) is part of the problem's requirement. So the method isn't an assumption but a constraint on how the problem is to be solved.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should list the conditions on x and the function sin(x)/x. The problem will state that the limit is 1 using epsilon-delta. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n- x is a real number approaching 0\n- x is measured in radians\n- x ≠ 0\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{\\sin(x)}{x} = 1$$ using the epsilon-delta definition of limit.\n\nI think that's accurate. The key is that the assumptions are about the variables and their conditions, not the proof method. The method is part of the problem statement. The example given by the user had assumptions about the variable n (integer, divisible by 7), so similarly here, assumptions are about x (approaching 0, in radians, not zero). The problem includes the requirement to use epsilon-delta.",
