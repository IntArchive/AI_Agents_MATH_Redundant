    "Content": "The problem is: If $G$ is a finite group with order not divisible by 3, and $(ab)^3=a^3b^3$ for all $a,b\\in G$, then show that $G$ is abelian. I have been trying this for a long time but not been able to make any progress. The only thing that I can think of is:\n$$ab\\cdot ab\\cdot ab=aaa\\cdot bbb\\implies(ba)^2=a^2b^2=aabb=(\\text{TPT})abba.$$\nNow, how can I prove the last equality? If I write $aabb=abb^{-1}abb$, then in order for the hypothesis to be correct, $b^{-1}abb=ba\\implies ab^2=b^2a$. Where am I going wrong? What should I do?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Suppose that $x\\in G$ satisfies $ x^3=e$. Then we cannot have $x\\ne e$, otherwise $x$ would have order 3, which implies that 3 divides $|G|$ (recall that the order of a group element divides the order of the group). Hence,\n$$\\forall x\\in G:\\quad x^3=e~\\Longrightarrow~x=e,$$\nand as $(ab)^3=a^3b^3$ for all $ a,b \\in G $, we see that the function $\\phi:G\\to G$ defined by\n$$\\forall x\\in G:\\quad\\phi(x) \\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=} x^3$$\nis an injective group homomorphism. Now,\n$$\\forall a,b\\in G:\\quad ababab=(ab)^3=a^3b^3=aaabbb.$$\nHence,\n$$\\forall a,b\\in G:\\quad baba=aabb,\\quad\\text{or equivalently},\\quad (ba)^2=a^2b^2.$$\nUsing this fact, we obtain\n\\begin{align}\n\\forall a,b\\in G:\\quad(ab)^4&= [(ab)^2]^2\\\\\n                                  &=[b^2a^2]^2\\\\\n                                  &=(a^2)^2(b^2)^2\\\\\n                                  &=a^4b^4\\\\\n                                  &=aaaabbbb.\n\\end{align} On the other hand,\n\\begin{align}\n\\forall a,b\\in G:\\quad(ab)^4&= abababab\\\\\n                                  &=a (ba)^3b\\\\\n                                  &=ab^3a^3b\\\\\n                                  &=abbbaaab.\n\\end{align} Hence, for all $a,b\\in G$, we have $aaaabbbb=abbbaaab$, which yields\n$$\\phi(ab)=a^3b^3=b^3a^3=\\phi(ba).$$\nAs $\\phi$ is injective, we conclude that $ab=ba$ for all $a,b\\in G$. Conclusion: $G$ is an abelian group.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The problem states that if G is a finite group whose order is not divisible by 3, and for all elements a and b in G, the equation (ab)^3 = a^3 b^3 holds, then G must be abelian. \n\nFirst, let me list out the assumptions clearly. The group G is finite, its order isn't divisible by 3, and the cube of the product of any two elements equals the product of their cubes. The goal is to show G is abelian, meaning every pair of elements commutes: ab = ba for all a, b in G.\n\nFrom the user's attempt, they started by expanding (ab)^3 = a^3 b^3. Let's write that out:\n\n(ab)(ab)(ab) = aaa bbb.\n\nMultiplying the left side out step by step: ababab. On the right side, it's a^3 b^3. So, ababab = a^3 b^3. \n\nCanceling the first a and the last b on both sides (since groups allow cancellation), we get bababa = a^2 b^2. Wait, maybe that's not the best approach. Alternatively, perhaps rearranging terms. Let's try:\n\nStarting with (ab)^3 = a^3 b^3. Let's multiply both sides on the left by a^{-1} and on the right by b^{-1}:\n\na^{-1} (ab)^3 b^{-1} = a^{-1} a^3 b^3 b^{-1} = a^2 b^2.\n\nBut the left side would be a^{-1} ab ab ab b^{-1}. Let's compute that:\n\na^{-1}ab = b, then b ab ab b^{-1}. Let's do this step by step:\n\na^{-1} * a = e, so a^{-1}ab = b. Then the next terms: b * ab = bab, then bab * ab = babab, then babab * b^{-1} = babab b^{-1} = baba (since ababab b^{-1} would reduce the last b). Hmm, maybe this isn't leading anywhere.\n\nAlternatively, let's manipulate the equation (ab)^3 = a^3 b^3 directly. Let's expand (ab)^3:\n\n(ab)(ab)(ab) = ababab.\n\nSet this equal to a^3 b^3. Then:\n\nababab = a^3 b^3.\n\nMultiply both sides on the left by a^{-1} and on the right by b^{-1}:\n\na^{-1}ababab b^{-1} = a^{-1}a^3 b^3 b^{-1}.\n\nSimplifying both sides:\n\nLeft side: (a^{-1}a)babab b^{-1} = e * babab * b^{-1} = babab * b^{-1} = baba (since babab * b^{-1} = bab a (b b^{-1}) = baba e = baba).\n\nRight side: a^{-1}a^3 = a^2 and b^3 b^{-1} = b^2. So right side is a^2 b^2.\n\nTherefore, we have baba = a^2 b^2.\n\nNow, let's write this as: baba = a^2 b^2. Let's rearrange this equation. If we multiply both sides on the left by b^{-1} and on the right by a^{-1}:\n\nb^{-1} baba a^{-1} = b^{-1} a^2 b^2 a^{-1}.\n\nLeft side simplifies: (b^{-1}b) a b a a^{-1} = e * a b * e = ab.\n\nRight side: b^{-1} a^2 b^2 a^{-1}. Let's see if we can rearrange this. Maybe factor it as b^{-1} a^2 b * b a^{-1}. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, note that the original equation after cancellation is baba = a^2 b^2. Let's write this as (ba)(ba) = a^2 b^2. That is, (ba)^2 = a^2 b^2.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned that they tried to get (ba)^2 = a^2 b^2 and then wanted to show that aabb = abba. Let me check that.\n\nIf (ba)^2 = a^2 b^2, then expanding (ba)^2 = ba ba. So ba ba = a^2 b^2. Let's multiply both sides on the left by a^{-1} and on the right by b^{-1} a^{-1}:\n\na^{-1} ba ba b^{-1} a^{-1} = a^{-1} a^2 b^2 b^{-1} a^{-1}.\n\nLeft side: a^{-1} b a * b a b^{-1} a^{-1}. Hmm, getting complicated. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the commutator. Let's recall that in a group, if we can show that the commutator [a,b] = aba^{-1}b^{-1} is the identity for all a, b, then the group is abelian.\n\nBut here, maybe there's a way to show that elements commute. Let's think about the given condition (ab)^3 = a^3 b^3. Let's try to manipulate this equation.\n\nAlternatively, take inverses of both sides. The inverse of (ab)^3 is (b^{-1}a^{-1})^3. The inverse of a^3 b^3 is b^{-3} a^{-3}. So:\n\n(b^{-1}a^{-1})^3 = b^{-3} a^{-3}.\n\nBut this seems similar to the original condition, but with inverses. Not sure if that helps.\n\nWait, the group has order not divisible by 3, so 3 does not divide |G|. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of every element divides |G|, so no element has order 3. Therefore, the map f: G → G defined by f(x) = x^3 is a bijection? Wait, since if the group has order coprime to 3, then the exponent 3 is coprime to the group's order, so the map x ↦ x^3 is indeed a bijection (by the generalization of Fermat's little theorem for groups). Therefore, every element has a unique cube root. So, this might be useful.\n\nLet me think. Since x ↦ x^3 is a bijection, then for any g in G, there exists a unique h in G such that h^3 = g. This might allow us to cancel terms in equations involving cubes.\n\nBut getting back to the equation (ab)^3 = a^3 b^3. Since the map x ↦ x^3 is a homomorphism? Wait, if the group is abelian, then yes, (ab)^3 = a^3 b^3. But here, we need to show the converse: that if (ab)^3 = a^3 b^3 for all a,b, then G is abelian.\n\nIn non-abelian groups, this property may not hold. But under the condition that 3 does not divide |G|, we might be able to manipulate this equation into commutativity.\n\nAnother approach: Let's use the given condition to derive commutator relations. Let's start by expanding (ab)^3 = a^3 b^3.\n\nCompute (ab)^3 = ababab. So ababab = a^3 b^3.\n\nMultiply both sides on the left by a^{-1} and on the right by b^{-1}:\n\na^{-1}ababab b^{-1} = a^{-1}a^3 b^3 b^{-1}\n\nSimplifying both sides:\n\nLeft side: (a^{-1}a)babab b^{-1} = e * babab * b^{-1} = babab * b^{-1} = baba (since ababab * b^{-1} = ababa).\n\nRight side: a^{2} b^{2}.\n\nSo we have baba = a^2 b^2.\n\nNow, let's rearrange this equation. Let's write baba = a^2 b^2. Let's multiply both sides on the left by a^{-1} and on the right by a^{-1}:\n\na^{-1}baba a^{-1} = a^{-1}a^2 b^2 a^{-1}\n\nLeft side: a^{-1}b a b a a^{-1} = a^{-1}b a b e = a^{-1}b a b.\n\nRight side: a^{1} b^2 a^{-1} = a b^2 a^{-1}.\n\nSo we have a^{-1} b a b = a b^2 a^{-1}.\n\nHmm, not sure if this helps. Let's try another manipulation. Starting from baba = a^2 b^2.\n\nLet's write this as (ba)^2 = a^2 b^2. Wait, (ba)^2 = b a b a. So, b a b a = a^2 b^2. Let's rearrange terms. Let's bring the a's to one side and the b's to the other. For example, multiply both sides on the left by a^{-2} and on the right by b^{-2}:\n\na^{-2} b a b a b^{-2} = e.\n\nBut this seems messy. Alternatively, perhaps consider that if we can show that ab = ba, but how?\n\nAnother idea: Let's use the fact that in a group where the map x ↦ x^k is a homomorphism and the group has order coprime to k, then the group is abelian. Here, since (ab)^3 = a^3 b^3, the map x ↦ x^3 is a homomorphism. And since 3 doesn't divide |G|, this homomorphism is injective (as the kernel is trivial), hence an automorphism. But does this imply the group is abelian?\n\nWait, not necessarily. For example, if a group has exponent dividing 3, but here the exponent is not 3 because |G| is not divisible by 3. But perhaps the homomorphism condition (ab)^3 = a^3 b^3 can force commutativity.\n\nAlternatively, consider the commutator [a,b] = aba^{-1}b^{-1}. If we can show that all commutators are trivial, then the group is abelian.\n\nLet's compute [a,b]^3. Since (ab)^3 = a^3 b^3, perhaps this can lead to something.\n\nFirst, note that (ab)^3 = a^3 b^3. Let's rearrange this:\n\nababab = a^3 b^3.\n\nMultiply both sides on the left by a^{-3} and on the right by b^{-3}:\n\na^{-3}ababab b^{-3} = e.\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\na^{-2}babab b^{-3} = a^{-2}bab a b^{-2} = a^{-2}ba bab^{-2} = ... This seems too convoluted.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's consider that the map φ: G → G defined by φ(x) = x^3 is a homomorphism. Since (ab)^3 = a^3 b^3, φ is a homomorphism. Also, since 3 does not divide |G|, φ is injective (because if x^3 = e, then the order of x divides 3 and |G|, but since 3 doesn't divide |G|, x must be e). Therefore, φ is an automorphism. \n\nNow, if φ is an automorphism and a homomorphism, what can we say about G? Maybe use the fact that G is nilpotent or something, but not sure. Alternatively, consider that in a group where the map x ↦ x^k is an automorphism, the group is called k-abelian, and such groups are abelian if k and the exponent of the group are coprime. Wait, there's a theorem by Alperin: If a group G is such that the map x ↦ x^k is an endomorphism, then G is abelian provided that k ≡ 1 mod m, where m is the exponent of G. But I might be misremembering.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that since φ is an automorphism, the group is n-abelian for n=3, and by a theorem, if a group is both m-abelian and n-abelian, then it is abelian. But I need to recall the exact statement.\n\nAlternatively, consider the work of proving that G is abelian by showing that all elements commute. Let's take two elements a and b in G. We need to show ab = ba.\n\nFrom the equation (ab)^3 = a^3 b^3, we can try to manipulate this equation to get ab = ba.\n\nLet's start with (ab)^3 = a^3 b^3. Let's compute (ab)^3 in another way. For example, expanding (ab)^3:\n\n(ab)(ab)(ab) = a b a b a b.\n\nWe can compare this to a^3 b^3 = a a a b b b.\n\nSo, a b a b a b = a a a b b b.\n\nCanceling the first a and the last b on both sides (by multiplying on the left by a^{-1} and on the right by b^{-1}), we get:\n\nb a b a = a a b b.\n\nWhich is the same as (ba)^2 = a^2 b^2.\n\nSo, (ba)^2 = a^2 b^2. Let's write this as:\n\nba ba = a a b b.\n\nNow, let's try to rearrange this. Let's multiply both sides on the left by b^{-1} and on the right by a^{-1}:\n\nb^{-1} ba ba a^{-1} = b^{-1} a a b b a^{-1}.\n\nSimplifying left side: (b^{-1}b) a b a a^{-1} = e * a b * e = a b.\n\nRight side: b^{-1} a^2 b^2 a^{-1}.\n\nSo, a b = b^{-1} a^2 b^2 a^{-1}.\n\nMultiply both sides on the left by b:\n\nb a b = a^2 b^2 a^{-1}.\n\nNow, multiply both sides on the right by a:\n\nb a b a = a^2 b^2.\n\nBut wait, this brings us back to the earlier equation: (ba)^2 = a^2 b^2. So this seems circular.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider another approach. Since the map φ(x) = x^3 is an automorphism, then for any a, b in G, there exist unique elements x, y in G such that x^3 = a and y^3 = b. Then, since φ is a homomorphism, φ(xy) = (xy)^3 = x^3 y^3 = a b. But also, φ(xy) must equal (xy)^3. However, since φ is a homomorphism, we have (xy)^3 = x^3 y^3, which is true by assumption. But this doesn't necessarily give us new information.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can use the fact that φ is an automorphism to get that G is abelian. Since φ is an automorphism and bijective, perhaps the group has certain properties. For example, if every element is a cube, then maybe we can relate this to the commutator.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider taking the equation (ab)^3 = a^3 b^3 and try to commute a and b.\n\nLet's write (ab)^3 = a^3 b^3. Let's expand (ab)^3 as a b a b a b. So:\n\na b a b a b = a a a b b b.\n\nCancel the first a and the last b:\n\nb a b a = a a b.\n\nWait, that's not correct. Let's do it step by step. Starting with:\n\na b a b a b = a a a b b b.\n\nMultiply both sides on the left by a^{-1} and on the right by b^{-1}:\n\na^{-1} a b a b a b b^{-1} = a^{-1} a a a b b b b^{-1}.\n\nSimplify left side:\n\ne * b a b a * e = b a b a.\n\nRight side:\n\ne * a a * e = a^2.\n\nSo, we have b a b a = a^2.\n\nWait, that's different. Wait, this can't be right. Let's check:\n\nOriginal equation: a b a b a b = a^3 b^3.\n\nLeft side after multiplying by a^{-1} and b^{-1}:\n\na^{-1} (a b a b a b) b^{-1} = (a^{-1} a) b a b a (b b^{-1}) = e b a b a e = b a b a.\n\nRight side after multiplying by a^{-1} and b^{-1}:\n\na^{-1} (a^3 b^3) b^{-1} = a^{2} b^{2}.\n\nSo indeed, we get b a b a = a^2 b^2.\n\nWhich is the same as (ba)^2 = a^2 b^2, which we had earlier.\n\nNow, let's consider the equation (ba)^2 = a^2 b^2. Let's rearrange this:\n\nba ba = a a b b.\n\nLet's compare this to the usual expansion of (ba)^2, which is ba ba. If the group were abelian, then this would equal b^2 a^2, but here it's given to be a^2 b^2. So this suggests that a^2 b^2 = b^2 a^2? Not necessarily, unless we can show that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the fact that since φ is an automorphism, we can consider inverses. Let's compute (ab)^{-3} = (b^{-1}a^{-1})^3 = b^{-3} a^{-3}. But also, since (ab)^3 = a^3 b^3, taking inverses gives (ab)^{-3} = b^{-3} a^{-3}. Comparing the two, we have:\n\nb^{-3} a^{-3} = b^{-3} a^{-3}.\n\nWhich is trivial, so no help.\n\nAnother idea: Let's try to show that all elements commute with their squares, i.e., a a^2 = a^2 a. Well, that's always true in a group, since multiplication is associative. Not helpful.\n\nWait, but maybe more generally, we need to show that a and b commute. Let's take specific elements. For example, let's set b = a. Then the condition becomes (a a)^3 = a^3 a^3, which is trivially true, since (a^2)^3 = a^6 = a^3 a^3. So no new info there.\n\nAlternatively, take b = a^{-1}. Then (a a^{-1})^3 = e^3 = e. On the other hand, a^3 (a^{-1})^3 = a^3 a^{-3} = e. So again, holds trivially.\n\nMaybe consider the commutator [a, b] = a b a^{-1} b^{-1}. We need to show this is e for all a, b.\n\nLet's cube the commutator: [a, b]^3 = (a b a^{-1} b^{-1})^3. Since G is not divisible by 3, and the order of any element divides |G|, which is not divisible by 3, so the order of [a, b] is coprime to 3, hence if [a, b]^3 = e, then [a, b] = e.\n\nSo, if we can show that [a, b]^3 = e, then since there's no element of order 3, [a, b] must be e. Let's try to compute [a, b]^3.\n\nFirst, note that [a, b] = a b a^{-1} b^{-1}. Then:\n\n[a, b]^3 = (a b a^{-1} b^{-1}) (a b a^{-1} b^{-1}) (a b a^{-1} b^{-1}).\n\nLet's compute this step by step. First, compute the first two factors:\n\n(a b a^{-1} b^{-1}) (a b a^{-1} b^{-1}) = a b a^{-1} (b^{-1} a) b a^{-1} b^{-1}.\n\nWait, let's compute:\n\nFirst factor: a b a^{-1} b^{-1}\n\nSecond factor: a b a^{-1} b^{-1}\n\nMultiplying them:\n\na b a^{-1} b^{-1} a b a^{-1} b^{-1}\n\nLet's insert parentheses for clarity:\n\n(a b a^{-1}) (b^{-1} a b a^{-1}) b^{-1}\n\nBut this might not help. Let's instead try to simplify:\n\nAfter the first two factors: a b a^{-1} b^{-1} a b a^{-1} b^{-1}\n\nNotice that b^{-1} a can be written as (a b)^something, but not sure. Alternatively, let's use the given condition (ab)^3 = a^3 b^3. Perhaps we can substitute somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, note that from earlier steps, we have (ba)^2 = a^2 b^2. Let's try to use this relation.\n\nStarting with (ba)^2 = a^2 b^2.\n\nLet's write this as:\n\nba ba = a a b b.\n\nLet's rearrange this equation. Let's move the leftmost b to the right side by multiplying both sides on the left by b^{-1}:\n\na a b b = b^{-1} (ba ba) = a ba b^{-1} a.\n\nWait, not sure. Alternatively, multiply both sides on the right by a^{-1} and on the left by b^{-1}:\n\nb^{-1} (ba ba) a^{-1} = b^{-1} a^2 b^2 a^{-1}.\n\nLeft side: (b^{-1} b) a b a a^{-1} = e a b e = a b.\n\nRight side: b^{-1} a^2 b^2 a^{-1}.\n\nSo, we have a b = b^{-1} a^2 b^2 a^{-1}.\n\nMultiply both sides on the left by b:\n\nb a b = a^2 b^2 a^{-1}.\n\nNow, multiply both sides on the right by a:\n\nb a b a = a^2 b^2.\n\nBut this is the same equation as before, (ba)^2 = a^2 b^2. So no progress.\n\nPerhaps another angle: Since the map x ↦ x^3 is an automorphism, then the group is 3-abelian. There's a theorem that states if a group is n-abelian for some integer n, then its commutator subgroup is contained in the set of elements satisfying x^{n(n-1)} = e. Here, n=3, so commutators satisfy x^{3*2} = x^6 = e. But since |G| is not divisible by 3, and x^6 = e, the order of any commutator must divide 6 and also divide |G|. Since |G| is not divisible by 3, the order must divide 2. Therefore, every commutator has order 1 or 2. But we need to show commutators are trivial.\n\nBut this might not directly help unless we can show that all elements of order 2 are central or something. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider that since the commutator [a,b] has order dividing 2, then [a,b]^2 = e. So, [a,b]^2 = e. Also, we know from earlier that [a,b]^3 = e because of the homomorphism condition. Wait, how?\n\nWait, if [a,b]^3 = e, and [a,b]^2 = e, then [a,b]^6 = e. But since [a,b]^3 = e and [a,b]^2 = e, then [a,b]^gcd(2,3) = [a,b]^1 = e. Hence, [a,b] = e. Therefore, if we can show that [a,b]^3 = e, then since [a,b]^2 = e (from being of order dividing 2), we would have [a,b] = e.\n\nBut how to show [a,b]^3 = e?\n\nLet's go back to the original equation (ab)^3 = a^3 b^3. Let's express this in terms of commutators. Let's write (ab)^3 = a^3 b^3. Let's expand the left side:\n\n(ab)^3 = ab ab ab.\n\nLet's insert commutators to relate this to a^3 b^3. For instance, we can write:\n\nab ab ab = a b a b a b.\n\nLet's try to move all a's to the left and b's to the right, but in the process, we pick up commutators.\n\nFirst, the term a b a can be written as a (b a) = a (a [b,a]) = a^2 [b,a].\n\nSimilarly, proceeding step by step:\n\nStart with a b a b a b.\n\nFirst, take the first two factors: a b.\n\nThen, the next a: a b a = a (b a) = a (a [b,a]) = a^2 [b,a].\n\nNow, the expression becomes a^2 [b,a] b a b.\n\nNow, we have a^2 [b,a] b a b.\n\nNext, handle the [b,a] b term. Since [b,a] = b a b^{-1} a^{-1}, so [b,a] b = b a b^{-1} a^{-1} b = b a b^{-1} (a^{-1} b).\n\nBut this might not help. Alternatively, perhaps we need to use the relation we derived earlier, (ba)^2 = a^2 b^2.\n\nFrom (ba)^2 = a^2 b^2, we can write ba ba = a^2 b^2. Then, multiply both sides on the left by a^{-2} and on the right by a^{-1} b^{-2}:\n\na^{-2} ba ba a^{-1} b^{-2} = e.\n\nThis gives a^{-2} b a b a^{-1} b^{-2} = e.\n\nNot sure. Alternatively, let's consider the derived subgroup (commutator subgroup) of G. If we can show that the commutator subgroup is trivial, then G is abelian. Since all commutators would be e.\n\nGiven that the commutator [a,b] has order dividing 2, and since the group has order not divisible by 3, perhaps the commutator subgroup has exponent 2. But even so, unless the commutator subgroup is trivial, we can't conclude G is abelian.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to show that a^3 commutes with b^3 for all a, b. But since the map x ↦ x^3 is surjective (as it's a bijection), then every element can be written as a cube. Hence, if cubes commute, then all elements commute. So, if a^3 and b^3 commute for all a, b, then since every element is a cube, all elements commute. Therefore, G is abelian.\n\nBut wait, since the map x ↦ x^3 is a bijection, for any g in G, there exists an h such that h^3 = g. Therefore, if we can show that a^3 and b^3 commute for all a, b, then since every element is a cube, all elements commute. Therefore, G is abelian.\n\nSo, let's check if a^3 and b^3 commute. Compute a^3 b^3 = (ab)^3 (from the given condition). But also, b^3 a^3 = (ba)^3. So, if (ab)^3 = (ba)^3, then a^3 b^3 = b^3 a^3. Thus, a^3 and b^3 commute.\n\nBut (ab)^3 = a^3 b^3, and (ba)^3 = b^3 a^3. If these are equal, then a^3 b^3 = b^3 a^3. But when are (ab)^3 and (ba)^3 equal?\n\nIn general, (ab)^3 = a b a b a b, and (ba)^3 = b a b a b a. These are not necessarily equal unless certain commuting conditions hold.\n\nBut according to the given condition, (ab)^3 = a^3 b^3. Similarly, (ba)^3 = b^3 a^3. So, unless a^3 b^3 = b^3 a^3, which would mean that a^3 and b^3 commute. However, this isn't necessarily given unless we can show it.\n\nBut since (ab)^3 = a^3 b^3 and (ba)^3 = b^3 a^3, if we can relate (ab)^3 and (ba)^3, perhaps using the previous equations.\n\nFrom the equation (ba)^2 = a^2 b^2, we can write (ba)^3 = (ba)^2 (ba) = a^2 b^2 ba = a^2 b^3 a.\n\nBut wait, (ba)^3 = (ba)(ba)(ba) = b a b a b a.\n\nFrom the earlier equation (ba)^2 = a^2 b^2, so replacing that:\n\n(ba)^3 = (ba)^2 (ba) = a^2 b^2 ba = a^2 b^3 a.\n\nBut according to the given condition, (ba)^3 should also equal b^3 a^3. So:\n\na^2 b^3 a = b^3 a^3.\n\nMultiply both sides on the left by a^{-2} and on the right by a^{-3}:\n\nb^3 a = a^{-2} b^3 a^{-2}.\n\nThis seems complicated. Alternatively, rearrange a^2 b^3 a = b^3 a^3:\n\na^2 b^3 a = b^3 a^3.\n\nMultiply both sides on the right by a^{-1}:\n\na^2 b^3 = b^3 a^3 a^{-1} = b^3 a^2.\n\nThus, a^2 b^3 = b^3 a^2.\n\nTherefore, we have that a^2 and b^3 commute for all a, b in G. Similarly, since the map x ↦ x^3 is surjective, every element is a cube, so any element can be written as c^3 for some c. Therefore, replacing b^3 with c, we get that a^2 and c commute for all a, c in G. Hence, a^2 is in the center of G for all a. Therefore, every square of an element is central.\n\nNow, if every square is central, then the group is nilpotent of class 2, i.e., [G, G] is in the center. But we need to show G is abelian.\n\nSince every a^2 is central, then for any a, b in G, a^2 b = b a^2. Now, consider the equation (ab)^3 = a^3 b^3. Since a^3 is (a^2) a, and a^2 is central, a^3 = a a^2 = a^2 a. Similarly, b^3 = b^2 b = b b^2.\n\nSo, (ab)^3 = a^3 b^3 = a^2 a b^2 b. Since a^2 and b^2 are central, we can rearrange:\n\na^2 b^2 a b.\n\nBut also, expanding (ab)^3:\n\nab ab ab = a b a b a b.\n\nSince a^2 and b^2 are central, let's see if we can manipulate this:\n\na b a b a b = a (b a) b a b.\n\nBut ba = a^{-1} a^2 b (since a^2 is central, so a^2 b = b a^2. Wait, a^2 b = b a^2, so b a = a b a^{-2} a^2 = a b a^{-2} a^2? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since a^2 is central, we can write b a = a b [b, a]^{-1}. But if a^2 is central, then [a, b] commutes with a^2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's use the fact that a^2 is central to rewrite b a = a b (since a^2 is central, but this doesn't directly give that a and b commute). Wait, maybe we can use the previous relation (ba)^2 = a^2 b^2.\n\nGiven that a^2 is central, then (ba)^2 = a^2 b^2 = b^2 a^2 (since a^2 is central). But (ba)^2 = b a b a. So:\n\nb a b a = b^2 a^2.\n\nMultiply both sides on the left by b^{-1} and on the right by a^{-1}:\n\na b a = b a^2 a^{-1} = b a.\n\nThus, a b a = b a.\n\nMultiply both sides on the right by a^{-1}:\n\na b = b a.\n\nAnd that's what we needed to show! So finally, this gives us ab = ba for all a, b in G, hence G is abelian.\n\nLet me recap that step to ensure it's correct. Starting from (ba)^2 = a^2 b^2, and knowing a^2 is central (so a^2 b^2 = b^2 a^2), we have:\n\n(ba)^2 = b a b a = b^2 a^2.\n\nMultiply both sides on the left by b^{-1} and on the right by a^{-1}:\n\nb^{-1} b a b a a^{-1} = b^{-1} b^2 a^2 a^{-1}.\n\nSimplifying left side: e a b e = a b.\n\nRight side: b e a e = b a.\n\nThus, a b = b a. Therefore, G is abelian.",
