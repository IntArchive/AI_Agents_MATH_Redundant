    "Content": "I am trying to prove the following statement: If $f \\in L^1$, then $\\hat f$ is uniformly continuous. The argument given is as follows : $$|\\hat f (\\xi +h )-\\hat f (\\xi)| = \\left| \\int f(x) (e^{-2 \\pi i x \\cdot (\\xi+h)}- e^{-2 \\pi i x \\cdot (\\xi)})\\mathrm dx \\right| \\leq 2 \\|f\\|_{L^1}$$ Now I suppose we have to use the Dominated Convergence Theorem, but I am unable to see to what sequence of functions we apply the theorem to. Any help is greatly appreciated.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I don't know if your questions has been answered in full.  For completeness, we apply DCT for the reasons you mentioned in your post.  The punchline of the story is: $$\\begin{align}\n\\left|\\widehat{f}(\\xi + h) - \\widehat{f}(\\xi)\\right|  &=  \\left| \\int f(x) \\left(e^{-2 \\pi i x \\cdot (\\xi + h)} - e^{-2 \\pi i \\xi \\cdot x} \\right)dx \\right|\n\\\\\n&\\leq \\int |f(x)| \\left|e^{2 \\pi i x \\cdot h} - 1  \\right| dx\n\\end{align}$$ which tends to zero as $h \\to 0$, and this is enough to show uniform continuity.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about proving that the Fourier transform of an L^1 function is uniformly continuous. The user provided an example where assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nFirst, I need to extract all the assumptions from the problem. The main assumption here is that the function f is in L^1. That's a single condition on the function f. The problem statement itself is to prove that the Fourier transform of f, denoted as ȃf, is uniformly continuous. \n\nLooking at the example given, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Each assumption was a separate line. In this case, the key assumption is that f belongs to L^1. There might be other implicit assumptions, like the Fourier transform being defined, but since the problem is in a standard context, I think the main explicit assumption is f ∈ L^1. \n\nThe problem statement is to prove that ȃf is uniformly continuous. The original question mentions using the Dominated Convergence Theorem, but the user wants to filter out the solution attempt and just present the structured problem. So the assumptions should only include the given conditions, not the methods to solve it.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n- f is an element of L^1 space.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the Fourier transform of f, denoted as ȃf, is uniformly continuous.\n\nWait, but the original problem statement in the question says \"If f ∈ L^1, then ȃf is uniformly continuous.\" So that's the core. The assumptions are f ∈ L^1, and the problem is to prove uniform continuity of ȃf. The example had each assumption on separate lines, even if they apply to the same object. Here, there's only one assumption: f ∈ L^1. So that's straightforward.\n\nI need to make sure there are no other hidden assumptions. The problem mentions using the Dominated Convergence Theorem, but that's part of the solution attempt, not the problem's assumptions. So in the formatted problem, we should only include the given assumptions, not the methods or steps to solve it.\n\nTherefore, the structured problem should have one assumption line stating f is in L^1, and the problem is to prove the Fourier transform is uniformly continuous.",
