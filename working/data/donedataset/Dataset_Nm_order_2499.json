    "Content": "It was shown in here that $\\left(1+\\frac{1}{n}\\right)^n < n$ for $n>3$. I think we can be come up with a better bound, as follows: $$\\left(1+\\frac{1}{n}\\right)^n \\le 3-\\frac{1}{n}$$\n  for all natural number $n$. The result is true for all real number $\\ge 1$, which can be shown using calculus. I wonder if the above result can be proved using mathematical induction? I have tried but fail! Anyway, this question is also inspired by, and related to this question . Edit: I also found that $$\\left(1+\\frac{1}{n+k}\\right)^n \\le 3-\\frac{k+1}{n}$$ for all natural number $k$, some large $N$ and $n > N$. This implies that $$\\left(1+\\frac{1}{2n}\\right)^n \\le 2-\\frac{1}{n}.$$ And again, I can't prove any of them using Mathematical Induction.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to help structure this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me read through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe user is asking about proving an inequality using mathematical induction: (1 + 1/n)^n ≤ 3 - 1/n for all natural numbers n. They mention that induction was tried but failed, and there's a related question where someone showed (1 + 1/n)^n < n for n > 3. They want to know if this better bound can be proven via induction.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem states \"for all natural number n\". The original problem's inequality is (1 + 1/n)^n ≤ 3 - 1/n. The assumptions here would be:\n\n- n is a natural number. That's the main condition. The original problem doesn't specify a starting point like n ≥ some number, so the induction would need to start at n=1, maybe. Wait, let's check the inequality for n=1: (1 + 1/1)^1 = 2 ≤ 3 - 1/1 = 2. That holds as equality. For n=2: (3/2)^2 = 2.25 ≤ 3 - 0.5 = 2.5. Holds. For n=3: (4/3)^3 ≈ 2.37 ≤ 3 - 1/3 ≈ 2.666... So it holds. So the induction base case would be n=1. But the user hasn't specified any additional constraints except that n is a natural number. So the only assumption is that n is a natural number. However, maybe there's an implicit assumption that the inequality holds for n ≥ 1, but since the problem states \"for all natural number n\", that's the key assumption.\n\nWait, the user also mentions that the result is true for all real numbers ≥1 when using calculus, but the question is about proving it via induction for natural numbers. So the problem is specifically about natural numbers. The assumptions would be n is a natural number, and the inequality is supposed to hold for all n in natural numbers. So in the assumption section, we just list that n is a natural number.\n\nBut wait, the example given in the user's initial prompt includes an assumption where n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in this problem, the assumption is simply that n is a natural number. The original problem doesn't mention any other conditions. So the assumptions here would just be one line: n is a natural number.\n\nThe problem is to prove that (1 + 1/n)^n ≤ 3 - 1/n using mathematical induction.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user says \"I wonder if the above result can be proved using mathematical induction?\" So the problem is asking whether induction can be used, but according to the format, the problem should be stated as the actual mathematical statement to prove. So the problem part should be \"Prove that (1 + 1/n)^n ≤ 3 - 1/n for all natural numbers n using mathematical induction.\"\n\nBut in the example given, the problem is phrased as \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91.\" So following that, here the problem is \"Prove that (1 + 1/n)^n ≤ 3 - 1/n for all natural numbers n using mathematical induction.\" However, the user's original question is asking whether this can be proved via induction, but the format requires the problem statement. So maybe the problem is just \"Prove that (1 + 1/n)^n ≤ 3 - 1/n for all natural numbers n using mathematical induction.\"\n\nBut maybe the user wants to structure the problem without specifying the method. Wait, the original problem says \"I wonder if the above result can be proved using mathematical induction?\" So the problem is to prove the inequality via induction, but the user is asking if it's possible. However, in the format, we need to present the problem as it is. The user's original problem is the inequality, and the question is whether induction works. But according to the example, the problem is the mathematical statement. So perhaps the problem should be \"Prove that (1 + 1/n)^n ≤ 3 - 1/n for all natural numbers n using mathematical induction.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just the inequality, and the user is asking if induction can be used. But the format requires the problem statement as it is. The example given had a problem statement \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91,\" even though the original problem might have said \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 under certain conditions.\" So in this case, the problem is to prove the inequality using induction. Therefore, the problem part should be \"Prove using mathematical induction that for all natural numbers n, (1 + 1/n)^n ≤ 3 - 1/n.\"\n\nBut the user's original problem includes the inequality and asks if it can be proved via induction. So the structured problem should be \"Prove that (1 + 1/n)^n ≤ 3 - 1/n for all natural numbers n using mathematical induction.\" However, the user might have tried induction and failed, so maybe there's a missing assumption. Wait, but according to the original problem, the user states that the result is true for all natural numbers n, as shown via calculus for real numbers ≥1, but wants an induction proof for natural numbers. So the problem is to use induction to prove the inequality for natural numbers. The only assumption is n is a natural number.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a natural number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\left(1+\\frac{1}{n}\\right)^n \\le 3-\\frac{1}{n}$$ for all natural numbers n using mathematical induction.\n\nWait, but the original problem's title says \"using mathematical induction,\" so that's part of the problem statement. Therefore, the problem includes the method. So that's correct.\n\nI need to check if there are any other assumptions. Since the original problem doesn't specify any other conditions, like n ≥ some number, but the user mentions that for real numbers ≥1, but here n is natural, so starting at n=1. The inequality holds at n=1, as 2 ≤ 2. So the induction would start at n=1. Therefore, the only assumption is that n is a natural number. There's no division by zero or other issues here, since n is natural, so n ≥ 1. Therefore, the assumption is only that n is a natural number.\n\nThus, the correct formatted problem would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nn is a natural number.\nProblem: \nProve that $$\\left(1+\\frac{1}{n}\\right)^n \\le 3-\\frac{1}{n}$$ for all natural numbers $n$ using mathematical induction.\n###",
