    "Content": "On pp.2-3 of Curtis, Abstract Linear Algebra , he gives a definition of a field which seems to fail to exclude a pathological example. He says a field is a set k with two operations (a+b) and (ab) such that: $k$ is an abelian group with + $k - {0}$ (where 0 is the additive identity of the above group) is an abelian group over multiplication for all a,b,c, $a(b + c) = ab + ac$. It is easy to prove, using distributivity, that for any $a$, $a0 = 0$. But proving that $0a = 0$ seems to require knowing that $(b + c)a = ba + ca$. However, proving that this is the case seems to require knowing that $0a = 0$. To be clear, if for nonzero $a, b$, $0a = b$, we get something quite pathological. $0b = 0(0a) = (00)a = 0a = b$, so $01 = 0(bb^{-1}) = (0b)b^{-1} = bb^{-1} = 1$. Now for any nonzero a, $a = a1 = a(01) = (a0)1 = 01 = 1$, so the only possible nonzero element is 1. But there's no contradiction here that I see. Define: 0+0 = 0 = 1+1\n0+1 = 1 = 1+0\n\n00 = 0 = 10\n11 = 1 = 01 Addition clearly gets you an abelian group. k - {0} is the trivial group, and distributivity is satisfied: 0(0+0) = 00 = 0 = 0 + 0 = 00 + 00\n0(0+1) = 01 = 0 + 01 = 00 + 01\n0(1+1) = 00 = 0 = 1 + 1 = 01 + 01\n\n1(0+0) = 10 = 0 = 0 + 0 = 10 + 10\n1(0+1) = 11 = 1 = 0 + 1 = 10 + 11\n1(1+1) = 10 = 0 = 1 + 1 = 11 + 11 I see the same definition for field on p. 34 of Dummit and Foote, 3ed. So have I made a mistake? Or is this definition lacking an additional axiom to exclude out the above case: for any a, b, c, $(a + b)c = ac + bc$ EDIT, Will Jagy: Corrected in Errata for the third edition of Dummit and Foote, see ERRATA PDF",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "EDIT Sunday Morning: I did not give Herstein, or frexids, enough credit. Herstein simply defines a (associative) ring as having both left and right distributive laws. So the later comment about a field being a ring with $1$ such that the nonzero elements form an abelian group is entirely appropriate. =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= I do still own some books that define a field. I'm a bit surprised. All three, essentially, including the linear algebra one, essentially define a commutative ring first, then say that a field is a commutative ring with identity and multiplicative inverses. So it appears that you have found a loophole. Actually Nering simply gives all the axioms in one page. So, my summary would be that, if a context had not been created before the field definition, there is a problem with the wording in your book. It seems possible that the language is a lazy copy from Herstein, who was a genuine expert. However, example 3.1.3 in the ancient edition I have reads: $R$ is the set of rational numbers under the usual addition and\n  multiplication of rational numbers. $R$ is a commutative ring with\n  unit element. But even more than that, note that the elements of $R$\n  different from $0$ form an abelian group under multiplication. A ring\n  with this latter property is called a field . As you have pointed out, this last line is lazy. Maybe people copied from this, the book is certainly influential. Then, in chapter 5, he correctly defines a field as a commutative ring with unit element and multiplicative inverses for nonzero elements. In sum, I would not add a second distributive law, I would just demand that multiplication be commutative for all pairs of elements. I had never heard of Dummit and Foote, so I searched online. I found a page of errata, here is the first page, which corrects page 34 in the third edition: =-=-=-=-=-=-= =-=-=-=-=-=-=",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user is pointing out a potential issue with the definition of a field in Curtis' Abstract Linear Algebra and also mentions Dummit and Foote. The main concern is that the given definition might allow a pathological example where left distributivity holds but right distributivity fails, leading to a structure that isn't a proper field.\n\nFirst, the assumptions need to be listed. The problem states Curtis' definition of a field with three conditions: \n1. k is an abelian group under addition.\n2. k - {0} is an abelian group under multiplication.\n3. For all a, b, c in k, a(b + c) = ab + ac (left distributivity).\n\nThe user then constructs an example with elements 0 and 1 where addition and multiplication are defined in a way that satisfies Curtis' definition but seems problematic. They show that in their example, right distributivity might not hold, leading to a structure where every non-zero element equals 1. However, they check all conditions and find that left distributivity holds, but right distributivity isn't required by Curtis' original axioms. \n\nThe key issue here is whether the definition provided by Curtis (and Dummit and Foote) is missing the right distributivity axiom. The user's example seems to satisfy all the given axioms but results in a structure that isn't a field because right distributivity isn't enforced. The user later mentions that Dummit and Foote corrected this in their errata by adding the right distributive law, which confirms that the original definition was indeed missing this.\n\nSo, the problem here is to show that under Curtis' definition (without right distributivity), there exists a pathological example that meets all stated axioms but isn't a valid field. The user is questioning whether the definition is faulty and if an additional axiom (right distributivity) is necessary to exclude such cases.\n\nNow, structuring this into the required format. The assumptions are the three given in Curtis' definition. The problem is whether this definition fails to exclude the pathological example, implying the need for an additional distributive axiom. However, since the user already constructed the example and verified the axioms, the core problem is more about identifying the missing axiom. But according to the user's edit, Dummit and Foote corrected it by adding the right distributive law, so the problem here is that the original definition lacks this, allowing the pathological case.\n\nSo, in the formatted problem, the assumptions would be the three conditions from Curtis, and the problem is to show that the definition is faulty because it allows such a pathological example, hence requiring an additional axiom (right distributivity).",
