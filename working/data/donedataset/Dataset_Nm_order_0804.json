    "Content": "while I was working through the examples of semidirect products of Dummit and Foote, I thought that it's possible to show that any semdirect product of two groups can't be abelian if the this semidirect product is not the direct product. Here is my simple idea: Suppose $H,K$ are two groups and $H\\rtimes K$ be the semidirect product of $H$ and $K$. Let $f:K \\rightarrow Aut(H)$ be our homomorphism from $K$ into $Aut(H)$, now we know that $H \\unlhd H\\rtimes K$ but not necessarily $K$. If $H\\rtimes K$  is abelian, then every subgroup of it is normal, so $K$ must be normal but if $K$ is normal then $f$ is the trivial homomorphism and so the semidirect product turns into the direct product, so the semdidirect product in this case is the direct product, which is a contradiction since we supposed that this semidirect product of $H,K$ is not their direct product. Is this true? Or have I made a mistake and there exists a counterexample?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You are correct. A semi-direct product of $H$ and $K$ is abelian iff $H$ is abelian, $K$ is abelian, and the semi-direct product is explicitly direct (the action is trivial). When $H$ and $K$ are not abelian you can have bizarre things like $H \\rtimes K$ is (isomorphic to) a direct product of $H$ and $K$, even though the action is not trivial. Take $H=K$ for example (to be non-abelian of order 6 to make it nice and clear). I learned this for $A_5 \\rtimes A_5$, and was recently reminded it was true for all non-abelian groups $H=K$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user is asking whether a semidirect product of two groups can be abelian if it's not a direct product. Their argument is that if the semidirect product is abelian, then all its subgroups are normal, which would force the homomorphism defining the semidirect product to be trivial, hence making it a direct product. They want to know if this is correct or if there's a counterexample.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the definition of a semidirect product. A semidirect product H ⋊φ K is constructed using a homomorphism φ: K → Aut(H). The underlying set is H × K, and the group operation is defined as (h1, k1)(h2, k2) = (h1 φ(k1)(h2), k1 k2). For this product to be abelian, every pair of elements must commute.\n\nThe user's reasoning is that if H ⋊φ K is abelian, then K must be normal in H ⋊φ K. Since in a semidirect product, H is normal by construction, but K isn't necessarily. However, in an abelian group, every subgroup is normal, so K would have to be normal. If K is normal, then the semidirect product is actually a direct product, implying φ is trivial. Thus, their conclusion is that any abelian semidirect product must be a direct product, so there are no non-direct semidirect products that are abelian.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a case where even with a non-trivial homomorphism φ, the semidirect product ends up abelian? Let's think of small groups. Let's take H and K as abelian groups. Suppose H is C2 (cyclic group of order 2) and K is C2 as well. Aut(H) is trivial since H has order 2, so any homomorphism φ: K → Aut(H) must be trivial. Thus, the semidirect product is direct. That's trivial.\n\nBut maybe take H as C3 and K as C2. Aut(H) is C2 (since automorphisms of C3 are inversion). So φ: C2 → Aut(C3) can be non-trivial. The semidirect product here is S3, which is non-abelian. So that doesn't help.\n\nWait, what if both H and K are abelian, and the action φ is non-trivial, but somehow the resulting group is abelian? For that to happen, the action must commute with the elements of H. Let's try with H = C3 × C3, K = C2. Let φ: C2 → Aut(H). Aut(H) is GL(2,3), which is non-abelian. Suppose φ maps the non-trivial element of C2 to an automorphism of order 2. For the semidirect product to be abelian, we need that (h1, k1)(h2, k2) = (h1 φ(k1)(h2), k1k2) equals (h2 φ(k2)(h1), k2k1). Since in abelian, the product must be the same when reversed. So for all h1, h2 in H and k1, k2 in K, we need:\n\nh1 φ(k1)(h2) = h2 φ(k2)(h1) and k1k2 = k2k1.\n\nSince K is abelian, the second condition holds. For the first condition, let's suppose K is C2, so k1 and k2 can be either 0 or 1 (if we think of C2 additively). Let’s take k1 = 1 and k2 = 1. Then we need h1 φ(1)(h2) = h2 φ(1)(h1). For all h1, h2 in H. If φ(1) is an automorphism of H, say inversion (if H is C3), but H here is C3 × C3. Suppose φ(1) is the automorphism that swaps the two factors. Then φ(1)(h1, h2) = (h2, h1). Then h1 φ(1)(h2) would be (h1_x h2_y, h1_y h2_x). On the other side, h2 φ(1)(h1) is (h2_x h1_y, h2_y h1_x). For these to be equal, we need h1_x h2_y = h2_x h1_y and h1_y h2_x = h2_y h1_x. But since H is abelian, multiplication is commutative, so these are equal. Wait, but then φ(1) is the swapping automorphism, but in this case, the semidirect product would actually be abelian? Let's check.\n\nTake two elements ( (a,b), 0 ) and ( (c,d), 1 ). Multiplying them gives ( (a,b) + φ(0)(c,d), 0 + 1 ) = ( (a + c, b + d), 1 ). But if we reverse the order, we have ( (c,d) + φ(1)(a,b), 1 + 0 ) = ( (c + b, d + a), 1 ). For these to be equal, we need a + c = c + b and b + d = d + a, which implies a = b and c = d. But this must hold for all a, b, c, d, which is not possible unless H is trivial. So this doesn't work. Thus, even with swapping automorphism, the semidirect product is non-abelian.\n\nAlternatively, maybe take H = C4 and K = C2. Aut(H) is C2 (inversion). Let φ: K → Aut(H) send the non-trivial element to inversion. Then the semidirect product is D4, which is non-abelian. So again, not abelian.\n\nWait, is there any case where a non-trivial semidirect product of two abelian groups is abelian? Let's take H and K as abelian groups. Suppose φ: K → Aut(H) is non-trivial. For the semidirect product H ⋊φ K to be abelian, we need that for all h1, h2 ∈ H and k1, k2 ∈ K, (h1, k1)(h2, k2) = (h1 φ(k1)(h2), k1k2) equals (h2 φ(k2)(h1), k2k1). So we must have:\n\nh1 φ(k1)(h2) = h2 φ(k2)(h1) and k1k2 = k2k1.\n\nSince K is abelian, the second condition is satisfied. For the first condition, let's set k1 = k and k2 = k'. Then for all h1, h2:\n\nh1 φ(k)(h2) = h2 φ(k')(h1).\n\nLet's consider the case when K is trivial. Then φ is trivial, so it's the direct product. If K is non-trivial, we need to see if there's a φ such that this equation holds for all k, k' in K and h1, h2 in H.\n\nLet’s suppose K is C2 and H is C2. Then Aut(H) is trivial, so φ must be trivial. So the only semidirect product is direct. If H is C3 and K is C2, Aut(H) is C2. Let’s take φ non-trivial. Then the semidirect product is S3, which is non-abelian.\n\nAlternatively, take H as an elementary abelian group, say C2 × C2, and K as C2. Aut(H) is S3. Suppose φ maps K to an automorphism of order 2. Then the semidirect product would have order 8. If we choose the automorphism to be, say, swapping two basis elements, then the semidirect product would be non-abelian, isomorphic to the dihedral group or the Klein four-group extended by C2. Wait, but if the action is non-trivial, then the group operation would have (h1, k1)(h2, k2) = (h1 + φ(k1)(h2), k1 + k2). If k1 = 1, then φ(1) acts as swapping. Let’s take h1 = (a, b), h2 = (c, d). Then φ(1)(h2) = (d, c). So the product is (a + d, b + c), k1 + k2). If we reverse the order, it would be (c + b, d + a), which is the same as (a + d, b + c) only if a + d = c + b and b + c = d + a. But since addition is commutative, this holds. Wait, but this seems to be commutative? Wait, maybe this works.\n\nWait, let me test specific elements. Let H = C2 × C2, with elements {(0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1)}. Let K = C2 = {0,1}. Let φ: K → Aut(H) send 1 to the automorphism that swaps coordinates, i.e., φ(1)(a, b) = (b, a). Then the semidirect product H ⋊φ K has elements like ((a,b), k). Let's compute ((1,0),1) * ((0,1),1) = ((1,0) + φ(1)(0,1), 1+1) = ((1,0) + (1,0), 0) = ((0,0), 0). On the other hand, ((0,1),1) * ((1,0),1) = ((0,1) + φ(1)(1,0), 1+1) = ((0,1) + (0,1), 0) = ((0,0), 0). So that's the same. What about ((1,0),1) * ((1,0),0) = ((1,0) + φ(1)(1,0),1+0) = ((1,0) + (0,1),1) = ((1,1),1). On the flip side, ((1,0),0) * ((1,0),1) = ((1,0) + φ(0)(1,0),0+1) = ((1,0)+(1,0),1) = ((0,0),1). Wait, these are different! So ((1,0),1)*((1,0),0) = ((1,1),1) and ((1,0),0)*((1,0),1) = ((0,0),1). These are not equal, so the group is non-abelian. Therefore, even with swapping automorphism, the semidirect product is non-abelian.\n\nHmm. So maybe the user is correct. If the semidirect product is abelian, then K must be normal, which implies that the action is trivial, hence it's a direct product. Therefore, the only way a semidirect product is abelian is if it's a direct product. Hence, there are no non-direct semidirect products that are abelian. So the answer is that the user's reasoning is correct, and there are no counterexamples.\n\nBut wait, wait, let's check with H = C3 and K = C2. Suppose we take the trivial action. Then H × K is C3 × C2, which is abelian. If we take a non-trivial action, the semidirect product is S3, which is non-abelian. So indeed, the only way to get an abelian semidirect product is via the trivial action, i.e., direct product.\n\nAnother angle: In a semidirect product H ⋊ K, the group is abelian iff for all h1, h2 in H and k1, k2 in K, we have (h1, k1)(h2, k2) = (h2, k2)(h1, k1). Expanding both sides:\n\nLeft side: (h1 φ(k1)(h2), k1k2)\n\nRight side: (h2 φ(k2)(h1), k2k1)\n\nFor these to be equal, we need k1k2 = k2k1 (so K must be abelian) and h1 φ(k1)(h2) = h2 φ(k2)(h1).\n\nAssume K is abelian (since the semidirect product is abelian), so k1k2 = k2k1.\n\nNow, set k2 = identity. Then the condition becomes h1 φ(k1)(h2) = h2 φ(identity)(h1) = h2 h1, since φ(identity) is the identity automorphism. Therefore, φ(k1)(h2) = h1^{-1} h2 h1. But since H is abelian, this implies φ(k1)(h2) = h2. Thus, φ(k1) is the identity automorphism for all k1, so φ is trivial. Hence, the semidirect product is direct.\n\nWait, this seems like a general proof. If H and K are abelian, and the semidirect product is abelian, then φ must be trivial. Thus, the only abelian semidirect product of two abelian groups is the direct product. So the user's conclusion is correct.\n\nBut the original problem didn't assume H and K are abelian. The user's argument is: If H ⋊ K is abelian, then K must be normal, hence the semidirect product is direct. But in the general case where H and K might not be abelian, does this hold?\n\nWait, if H ⋊ K is abelian, then both H and K must be abelian, since subgroups of abelian groups are abelian. So H and K are abelian. Then, as above, the action must be trivial. Therefore, the only way for the semidirect product to be abelian is if it's a direct product. Hence, the user's reasoning is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that the user's conclusion is correct: any abelian semidirect product must be a direct product. There are no counterexamples.",
