    "Content": "Browsing the web I came across this: The conjugacy class of an element $g\\in A_{n}$ : splits if the cycle decomposition of $g\\in A_{n}$ comprises cycles of distinct odd length. Note that the fixed points are here treated as cycles of length $1$ , so it cannot have more than one fixed point; and does not split if the cycle decomposition of $g$ contains an even cycle or contains two cycles of the same length. Anybody with a proof?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Note the following: (1) The conjugacy class in $S_n$ of an element $\\sigma \\in A_n$ splits, iff there is no element $\\tau \\in S_n\\setminus A_n$ commuting with $\\sigma$ . For if there is one, for each $\\tau' \\in S_n \\setminus A_n$ we have $$ \\tau'\\sigma{\\tau'}^{-1} = \\tau'\\sigma\\tau\\tau^{-1}\\tau'{}^{-1}\n    = (\\tau'\\tau)\\sigma(\\tau'\\tau)^{-1}\n$$ and $\\tau\\tau' \\in A_n$ . On the other hand, if $\\tau\\sigma\\tau^{-1}$ and $\\sigma$ with $\\tau \\in S_n\\setminus A_n$ are conjugate in $A_n$ , then for some $\\tau' \\in A_n$ , we have $\\tau\\sigma\\tau^{-1} = \\tau'\\sigma\\tau'^{-1}$ , giving $$ \\tau'{}^{-1}\\tau \\sigma = \\sigma\\tau'{}^{-1}\\tau $$ and hence $\\tau'{}^{-1}\\tau \\in S_n\\setminus A_n$ commutes with $\\sigma$ . Now suppose, $\\sigma$ has a cycle $c_i$ of even length. A cycle of even length is an element of $S_n \\setminus A_n$ , and as $\\sigma$ commutes with its cycles, we are done by the above. If $\\sigma$ has two cycles $(a_1\\ldots a_\\ell)$ and $(b_1 \\ldots b_\\ell)$ of the same odd length $\\ell$ , then $(a_1b_1) \\ldots (a_\\ell b_\\ell)$ is a product of $\\ell$ transpositions (hence odd, so an element of $S_n \\setminus A_n$ ) commuting with $\\sigma$ . Now suppose $\\sigma = c_1 \\cdots c_s$ is a product of odd cycles $c_i$ of distinct length $d_i$ . Let $\\tau \\in S_n$ be a permutation commuting with $\\sigma$ . Then $\\tau$ must fix each of the $c_i$ , that is, $\\tau$ must be of the form $\\tau = c_1^{a_1} \\cdots c_s^{a_s}$ for some $a_i \\in \\mathbb Z$ . But as the $c_i$ are even permutations (as cycles of odd length), we have $\\tau \\in A_n$ . So no $\\tau \\in S_n \\setminus A_n$ commutes with $\\sigma$ and we are done.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem from Math Stack Exchange. The user is asking about the splitting of conjugacy classes in the alternating group \\( A_n \\). The main points mentioned are that a conjugacy class splits if the element has cycles of distinct odd lengths, and doesn't split if there's an even cycle or two cycles of the same length.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question and extract the assumptions and the problem statement according to the required format. The example provided helps clarify the structure. The assumptions should list each condition applied to one object, line by line. The problem should then state what needs to be proven.\n\nLooking at the original question: The user refers to conjugacy classes in \\( A_n \\). The key conditions are about when the conjugacy class of an element \\( g \\in A_n \\) splits. The conditions given are:\n\n1. The conjugacy class splits if the cycle decomposition of \\( g \\) consists of cycles of distinct odd lengths. Here, fixed points are considered cycles of length 1, so the element can't have more than one fixed point (since that would mean two cycles of length 1, which are the same length).\n\n2. The conjugacy class does not split if the cycle decomposition contains an even cycle or two cycles of the same length.\n\nThe problem is to provide a proof for these statements. However, the user's exact question is \"Anybody with a proof?\" so the problem statement should be to prove the given conditions about splitting of conjugacy classes in \\( A_n \\).\n\nNow, structuring this into the required format:\n\nAssumptions need to be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. The original problem mentions:\n\n- For splitting: cycle decomposition comprises cycles of distinct odd lengths. Fixed points are cycles of length 1, so cannot have more than one fixed point (since two fixed points would be two cycles of length 1, violating distinctness).\n\n- For not splitting: cycle decomposition contains an even cycle or two cycles of the same length.\n\nBut since the problem is about proving these two statements, the assumptions would be the conditions under which splitting or not splitting occurs. However, the user is asking for a proof of these conditions, so perhaps the assumptions are the properties of the element \\( g \\in A_n \\).\n\nWait, maybe the problem is to prove two directions: if the cycle decomposition has distinct odd cycles, then the conjugacy class splits in \\( A_n \\); and if the cycle decomposition has an even cycle or two cycles of the same length, then it doesn't split. So the problem is to prove both directions.\n\nBut how to structure the assumptions? The original question states two separate cases. The assumptions should be the conditions given in the problem. However, in the example provided, the assumption was that \\( n \\) is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is about elements in \\( A_n \\), so the assumptions would relate to the element \\( g \\)'s cycle structure.\n\nBut the user's problem is to prove the given statements. So perhaps the assumptions are part of the problem statement, not additional assumptions. Wait, the example given had the problem statement include the conditions as part of the problem. Let me check:\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove that \\( A(n) \\) is divisible by 91 for every integer \\( n \\). The formatted problem listed assumptions as \\( n \\) is an integer, \\( n \\) is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original example, the problem didn't assume \\( n \\) is divisible by 7; the original problem was for every integer \\( n \\). However, the formatted example incorrectly included \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, maybe the example had a mistake, but the user provided it as their own example. So following that example, perhaps the task is to list all the assumptions from the problem, even if they are part of the conditions in the problem statement.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user is stating two conditions for splitting and not splitting. So the problem is to prove that:\n\n1. If \\( g \\in A_n \\) has a cycle decomposition with cycles of distinct odd lengths (including at most one fixed point), then its conjugacy class in \\( A_n \\) splits.\n\n2. If \\( g \\in A_n \\) has a cycle decomposition containing an even cycle or two cycles of the same length, then its conjugacy class in \\( A_n \\) does not split.\n\nSo translating this into the format, the assumptions would be the conditions on \\( g \\), and the problem is to prove the splitting or non-splitting accordingly. However, the original problem as stated by the user combines both directions into one problem. The user wrote: \"The conjugacy class of an element \\( g \\in A_n \\): splits if [condition], does not split if [condition]. Anybody with a proof?\"\n\nTherefore, the problem is to prove both statements. So the assumptions would be the two conditions (for splitting and not splitting), each as separate assumptions, but the problem is to prove both. However, the example given in the user's instruction had the assumption listed as separate line items, each addressing one property. So in this case, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The conjugacy class of \\( g \\in A_n \\) splits if the cycle decomposition of \\( g \\) comprises cycles of distinct odd lengths.\n\nBut wait, no. The problem is to prove that these conditions hold. So the assumptions are the given conditions in the problem statement. Wait, maybe the problem is phrased as \"Prove that the conjugacy class splits if condition A holds and does not split if condition B holds.\"\n\nTherefore, the problem statement is to prove both implications. So in the formatted problem, the assumptions would list the conditions given for splitting and not splitting, but each as separate assumptions. However, in the example, the assumptions were about the variables in the problem. Here, the problem is about conjugacy classes in \\( A_n \\), so the assumptions would relate to the properties of \\( g \\).\n\nWait, perhaps the assumptions should list each condition that is given as part of the problem statement. Since the problem is to prove that under certain conditions on \\( g \\), the conjugacy class splits or doesn't split, each condition becomes an assumption. But the problem is to prove the splitting/non-splitting based on those conditions.\n\nBut the original problem states two separate cases: one where the class splits and one where it doesn't. So perhaps the formatted problem should have two separate assumptions:\n\n1. The cycle decomposition of \\( g \\in A_n \\) comprises cycles of distinct odd lengths (including at most one fixed point).\n\n2. The cycle decomposition of \\( g \\in A_n \\) contains an even cycle or two cycles of the same length.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that in the first case, the conjugacy class splits, and in the second case, it does not split. However, the problem statement as per the user's question is to prove both statements. Therefore, the problem would be structured as:\n\nProblem: Prove that the conjugacy class of \\( g \\in A_n \\) splits if the cycle decomposition of \\( g \\) comprises cycles of distinct odd lengths and does not split if the cycle decomposition contains an even cycle or two cycles of the same length.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions should list the conditions. However, in the example, the assumption was that \\( n \\) is an integer and divisible by 7, which were conditions given in the problem. But in the original problem here, the conditions are part of the \"if\" clauses. So perhaps the assumptions should not be listed because the problem is to prove an implication. Wait, the example may have been a bad example because in the original problem, the user had an error in their example. Let me re-examine the example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer \\( n \\), \\( A(n) \\) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem assumption: \\( n \\) is an integer, \\( n \\) is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that \\( A(n) \\) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer \\( n \\)\", which means the assumption should be that \\( n \\) is an integer. But in the formatted example, they added an extra assumption that \\( n \\) is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. That seems like a mistake. But perhaps the user intended to structure the problem with all conditions as assumptions, even if they are universal quantifiers. However, this is confusing.\n\nGiven that, perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions should list the conditions given in the problem statement. Since the problem is to prove that under condition A, the class splits, and under condition B, it doesn't, then the assumptions would be the conditions for each case.\n\nBut the problem is to prove both statements. However, the example splits the original problem into assumptions and the problem. So perhaps in this case, since the original problem states two separate conditions (split if..., does not split if...), the formatted problem would have two separate parts. But the format requires one problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem statement is as given, and the assumptions are the general context (e.g., \\( g \\in A_n \\), conjugacy classes in alternating groups, etc.), but I think the key is that in the example, the user included the divisibility by 7 as an assumption, which wasn't in the original problem. This suggests that the user might have made a mistake in their example. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach here is to list the conditions given in the problem as assumptions, even though they are part of the problem's \"if\" clauses.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions should list the general conditions (like \\( g \\in A_n \\)), and the problem statement includes the specific conditions. But the example contradicts that.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to structure the problem as:\n\nAssumptions:\n- \\( g \\) is an element of \\( A_n \\).\n- The cycle decomposition of \\( g \\) comprises cycles of distinct odd lengths.\n- The cycle decomposition of \\( g \\) contains an even cycle or two cycles of the same length.\n\nProblem: Prove that the conjugacy class of \\( g \\) in \\( A_n \\) splits in the first case and does not split in the second case.\n\nBut this seems to conflate two separate cases into one problem. Alternatively, perhaps split into two separate problems, but the format requires one problem.\n\nAlternatively, since the original problem presents both cases together, the formatted problem would have the problem statement encompassing both, with assumptions being the two conditions. However, the example's formatting might require listing each condition as a separate assumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions are just the general context, like \\( g \\in A_n \\), and the problem statement includes the conditions. But the example listed specific conditions as assumptions.\n\nGiven the user's example, even though it might be incorrect, we need to follow it. In their example, the original problem was to prove for every integer \\( n \\), but in the formatted problem, they listed assumptions as \\( n \\) is an integer and \\( n \\) is divisible by 7. This suggests that they extracted conditions from the problem statement, even if they were part of the universal quantifier. So perhaps the user's approach is to list all conditions mentioned in the problem statement as assumptions, even if they are part of the \"for every\" clause.\n\nApplying that here, the original problem mentions:\n\n- The conjugacy class splits if the cycle decomposition has cycles of distinct odd lengths, considering fixed points as cycles of length 1, so cannot have more than one fixed point.\n\n- Does not split if there's an even cycle or two cycles of the same length.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- \\( g \\in A_n \\).\n\n- The cycle decomposition of \\( g \\) comprises cycles of distinct odd lengths (including at most one fixed point).\n\n- The cycle decomposition of \\( g \\) contains an even cycle or two cycles of the same length.\n\nBut since these are two separate cases (split vs. not split), perhaps the problem statement should encompass both. However, the user's example formatted the problem as one problem with assumptions. But in the example, the original problem had a universal quantifier (\"for every integer n\"), but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. This suggests that maybe the user wants to extract the conditions from the problem statement, even if they are part of the implications.\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem was to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. However, the formatted problem included \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which is incorrect. This indicates that the user might have made a mistake in their example. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to list all the conditions given in the problem as assumptions, even if they are part of the implications.\n\nBut given that, in the current problem, the two cases (split if... and does not split if...) are part of the problem statement, not assumptions. Therefore, the problem is to prove both implications. The assumptions would be the general context, like \\( g \\in A_n \\), and the problem statement would include the two conditions. However, according to the user's example, they extracted specific conditions from the problem as assumptions, even if they were part of the implication.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, perhaps the best way is to follow the user's example structure, even if flawed. In their example, the original problem was a universal statement, but they added an assumption that wasn't there. Therefore, in the current problem, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- \\( g \\in A_n \\).\n\n- The cycle decomposition of \\( g \\) comprises cycles of distinct odd lengths.\n\n- The cycle decomposition of \\( g \\) contains an even cycle or two cycles of the same length.\n\nBut the problem would be to prove that the conjugacy class splits in the first case and does not split in the second case. However, this combines two separate problems into one. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to prove the two statements:\n\n1. If the cycle decomposition of \\( g \\in A_n \\) comprises cycles of distinct odd lengths, then its conjugacy class splits.\n\n2. If the cycle decomposition of \\( g \\in A_n \\) contains an even cycle or two cycles of the same length, then its conjugacy class does not split.\n\nBut according to the format, we need to have one problem statement. Therefore, the problem would be stated as proving both implications, and the assumptions would list each condition. However, the example had multiple assumptions listed line by line. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\\( g \\in A_n \\),\nThe cycle decomposition of \\( g \\) comprises cycles of distinct odd lengths,\nThe cycle decomposition of \\( g \\) contains an even cycle or two cycles of the same length.\n\nProblem: Prove that the conjugacy class of \\( g \\) in \\( A_n \\) splits if the cycle decomposition comprises cycles of distinct odd lengths and does not split if the decomposition contains an even cycle or two cycles of the same length.\n\nBut perhaps the assumptions should be split into two separate assumptions for the two cases. However, the example listed two separate assumptions (n is integer, n divisible by 7) even though the original problem didn't require divisibility by 7. This suggests that the user might have intended to include all conditions mentioned, even if they are part of the problem's \"if\" clauses.\n\nAlternatively, considering the user's example might have been a mistake, perhaps the correct approach is to list only the general assumptions, such as \\( g \\in A_n \\), and have the problem statement include the specific conditions. But without further clarification, it's best to follow the user's example structure, even if it's flawed.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\\( g \\in A_n \\),\nThe cycle decomposition of \\( g \\) comprises cycles of distinct odd lengths,\nThe cycle decomposition of \\( g \\) contains an even cycle or two cycles of the same length.\n\nProblem: Prove that the conjugacy class of \\( g \\) in \\( A_n \\) splits in the first case and does not split in the second case.\n\nBut this seems to combine two separate conditions into one problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to prove both directions, and the assumptions are the properties of \\( g \\). However, since the problem involves two separate conditions, it might be better to list each condition as a separate assumption. But according to the user's example, each assumption should address only one property applied to one object.\n\nIn the original problem, for the splitting case, the condition is that the cycle decomposition has cycles of distinct odd lengths (including at most one fixed point). For the non-splitting case, the conditions are having an even cycle or two cycles of the same length. So each of these is a separate condition on \\( g \\).\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- \\( g \\in A_n \\).\n\n- The cycle decomposition of \\( g \\) comprises cycles of distinct odd lengths.\n\n- The cycle decomposition of \\( g \\) contains an even cycle.\n\n- The cycle decomposition of \\( g \\) contains two cycles of the same length.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that in the first case (distinct odd lengths), the class splits, and in the other cases (even cycle or duplicate lengths), it doesn't split. However, the user's example listed two assumptions (n is integer, n divisible by 7) for a problem that originally stated \"for every integer n\". This suggests that perhaps the user wants to list each condition as a separate assumption, even if they are part of the problem's \"if\" clauses.\n\nGiven that, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\\( g \\in A_n \\),\nThe cycle decomposition of \\( g \\) comprises cycles of distinct odd lengths (including at most one fixed point),\nThe cycle decomposition of \\( g \\) contains an even cycle,\nThe cycle decomposition of \\( g \\) contains two cycles of the same length.\n\nProblem: Prove that the conjugacy class of \\( g \\) in \\( A_n \\) splits if the cycle decomposition comprises cycles of distinct odd lengths and does not split if the decomposition contains an even cycle or two cycles of the same length.\n\nHowever, this seems to list the conditions for both cases as assumptions, which might not be correct because an element can't satisfy both conditions simultaneously. But according to the user's example, it's acceptable to list multiple conditions as assumptions even if they are mutually exclusive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is structured as two separate problems, but the user's format requires a single problem. Therefore, the assumptions are the general conditions (being in \\( A_n \\)), and the problem statement includes the specific cases.\n\nBut given the example, the safest approach is to list each condition from the problem statement as separate assumptions. Therefore, the final formatted problem would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$g$ is an element of $A_n$,\nThe cycle decomposition of $g$ comprises cycles of distinct odd lengths (including at most one fixed point),\nThe cycle decomposition of $g$ contains an even cycle,\nThe cycle decomposition of $g$ contains two cycles of the same length.\nProblem: \nProve that the conjugacy class of $g$ in $A_n$ splits if the cycle decomposition comprises cycles of distinct odd lengths and does not split if the decomposition contains an even cycle or two cycles of the same length.\n###END_OF_FORMAT###",
