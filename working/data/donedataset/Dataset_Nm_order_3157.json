    "AcceptedAnswer": "The right bound is $$\\int_0^1 f(x)^2\\,dx ≤ \\frac{52}{35}\\left(\\int_0^1 f(x)\\,dx\\right)^2.$$ which is tight; for example, $f(x) = 3x^2 - 2x^3$ attains equality. To prove it, let \\begin{gather*}\na = f(0) ≥ 0, \\quad b = f'(0) ≥ 0, \\quad  c = f(1) ≥ 0,\\quad  d = -f'(1) ≥ 0, \\\\\np(x) = (1 - x)^2[a(1 + 2x) + bx] + x^2[c(3 - 2x) + d(1 - x)]\n\\end{gather*} be the cubic with $p(0) = a$ , $p'(0) = b$ , $p(1) = c$ , $p'(1) = -d$ , and let $$r(x, y) = \\begin{cases}\nx^2(1 - y)^2(3y - x - 2xy) \\frac{f^{(4)}(y)}{6} & \\text{if $0 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 1$}, \\\\\n(1 - x)^2y^2(3x - y - 2xy) \\frac{f^{(4)}(y)}{6} & \\text{if $0 ≤ y ≤ x ≤ 1$}.\n\\end{cases}$$ For $0 ≤ x, y ≤ 1$ , we have $p(x) ≥ 0$ and $r(x, y) ≥ 0$ ; we can check that $$\\int_0^1 r(x, y)\\,dy = f(x) - p(x)$$ via repeated integration by parts.  We also have \\begin{gather*}\n\\int_0^1 p(x)\\,dx = \\frac{6a + b + 6c + d}{12}, \\\\\n\\begin{split}\n&\\int_0^1 p(x)^2\\,dx \\\\\n&\\quad = \\frac{78a^2 + 22ab + 2b^2 + 54ac + 13bc + 78c^2 + 13ad + 3bd + 22cd + 2d^2}{210},\n\\end{split} \\\\\n\\begin{split}\n&\\frac{52}{35}\\left(\\int_0^1 p(x)\\,dx\\right)^2 - \\int_0^1 p(x)^2\\,dx \\\\\n&\\quad = \\frac{24ab + b^2 + 612ac + 78bc + 78ad + 8bd + 24cd + d^2}{1260} ≥ 0,\n\\end{split} \\\\\n\\int_0^1 p(x)^2\\,dx ≤ \\frac{52}{35}\\left(\\int_0^1 p(x)\\,dx\\right)^2.\n\\end{gather*} Furthermore, $$\\int_0^1 r(x, y)\\,dx = y^2(1 - y)^2 \\frac{f^{(4)}(y)}{24},$$ and if $0 ≤ y ≤ z ≤ 1$ , \\begin{split}\\int_0^1 r(x, y)r(x, z)\\,dx\n&= y^2(1 - z)^2(-y^5 + 7y^4z - 2y^5z + 12z^2 - 22yz^2 + 2z^3 \\\\\n&\\qquad  + 8yz^3 - 8z^4 + 3yz^4 + 3z^5 - 2yz^5)\\frac{f^{(4)}(y)f^{(4)}(z)}{5040} \\\\\n&≤ 13y^2(1 - y)^2z^2(1 - z)^2\\frac{f^{(4)}(y)f^{(4)}(z)}{5040} \\\\\n&= \\frac{52}{35}\\int_0^1 r(x, y)\\,dx \\int_0^1 r(x, z)\\,dx,\n\\end{split} and similarly if $0 ≤ z ≤ y ≤ 1$ .

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, the user wants me to structure the given math problem into the specified format. The original problem is about proving an integral inequality with certain conditions on the function f. \n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions. The problem states that f is in C^4[0,1], which means it's four times continuously differentiable on the interval [0,1]. Then there are specific conditions: f(x) is non-negative for all x in [0,1], the first derivative at 0 is non-negative (f'(0) ≥ 0), the first derivative at 1 is non-positive (f'(1) ≤ 0), and the fourth derivative is non-negative everywhere on [0,1] (f''''(x) ≥ 0). Each of these should be a separate assumption. \n\nNext, the problem statement is to show that the integral of f squared is less than or equal to this specific constant times the square of the integral of f. The constant given is 423405/246064, which they mention is the best possible coefficient. \n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed one per line, each addressing one property of a single object. So here, each condition on f and its derivatives should be separate. The function f is the main object here, so each condition applies to f or its derivatives. \n\nWait, let me check again. The user's example had assumptions like \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7.\" Each as separate lines. So here, the assumptions are:\n\n- f is in C^4[0,1] (so four times continuously differentiable)\n- f(x) ≥ 0 for all x in [0,1]\n- f'(0) ≥ 0\n- f'(1) ≤ 0\n- f''''(x) ≥ 0 for all x in [0,1]\n\nEach of these is a separate condition on f or its derivatives, so each should be a separate assumption line.\n\nThe problem part is to prove the inequality involving the integrals. The problem mentions that the coefficient 423405/246064 is the best possible, but according to the example, that information might be part of the problem statement. Wait, in the original example, the problem was restated with the divisibility condition. Here, the user included \"show that...\" which is the problem. The \"best\" part was in the original question's comments, but in the example, the \"best\" part wasn't included in the problem statement. Wait, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\" but the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. The \"is best\" part here might be extra information, but the example didn't include such remarks in the problem statement. So perhaps the problem part should just be the inequality with the coefficient, and the fact that it's the best coefficient is part of the context but not the problem statement. However, the user's example did include \"is best\" in the problem statement. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the example given by the user, the original problem had \"is divisible by 91\" and the formatted problem included that. But in the example, the user included \"is divisible by 91\" as the problem. Wait, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, which was the problem statement. In the current problem, the user's original question says \"show that [inequality]\" and mentions \"the 423405/246064 is best\". So in the problem statement, should that be included? The example provided by the user didn't include such a remark. Let me check the example again.\n\nThe user's example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, n was any integer, but in the formatted problem, it added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. Wait, maybe that was a mistake? Wait, no, perhaps the original problem had a different structure. Wait, the example might have been edited by the user. Hmm, maybe the user modified the original problem for the example. Anyway, in the current problem, the user wrote in their original question that the coefficient is the best, and in their own approach, they mentioned that it's best. So in the problem statement, should we include that the coefficient is best?\n\nIn the example, the problem statement in the formatted version was just \"Prove that... is divisible by 91.\" without mentioning that it's the optimal coefficient. However, in the current problem, the user's original question includes \"the 423405/246064 is best\" in the title and in the problem statement. Therefore, perhaps in the problem section, we should include that it's the best possible coefficient. But the example didn't include such a remark. Wait, in the example, the original problem didn't mention \"optimal\" but the formatted problem didn't include it either. So maybe the instruction is to structure the problem as per the given example, which in that case didn't include \"optimal\" in the problem statement. Therefore, perhaps here, we should follow the same approach: the problem is to show the inequality, and the \"best\" part is extra information but not part of the problem statement itself. However, the user's example also had \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, this is confusing. Let me recheck.\n\nOriginal example provided by user:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Unless there was a typo. Maybe the original problem had n divisible by 7? Or perhaps the user made a mistake in their example. Because in the original problem as stated, the divisibility by 91 would require that n is such that 5^n and 6^n have certain properties modulo 7 and 13 (since 91=7*13). But maybe the problem was to prove for n divisible by 7, but the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So perhaps the user's example is incorrect, but regardless, the instruction is to follow that format.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's question includes conditions on f and wants to prove the inequality with the specific coefficient. The fact that the coefficient is optimal is part of the problem statement in the original question's title and in the \"New add it\" part. However, in the example, such remarks were not included in the problem statement. Therefore, to follow the example, perhaps we should include only the main problem: showing the inequality, and list the assumptions as the conditions given. The \"best\" coefficient part might be additional context but not part of the problem to prove. However, the user included in their own problem statement \"the $\\dfrac{423405}{246064}$ is best\", so maybe we should include that in the problem statement. \n\nLooking at the user's formatted example, the problem part is exactly the original problem's request. So if the original problem says \"show that...\", then that's the problem. The fact that the coefficient is best is an additional comment, but perhaps not part of the problem statement. But in the user's example, they had an original problem that said \"for every integer n\" but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which changes the problem. That seems inconsistent. Wait, maybe the example was a mistake, but the user might have intended to structure the assumptions and problem as per the original, but perhaps with some clarification.\n\nBut perhaps the user wants to split the problem into assumptions and the actual question. In the current problem, the assumptions are the conditions on f, and the problem is to show the inequality. The fact that the coefficient is the best possible might be part of the problem or an additional note. Since the original problem's title mentions \"the optimal coefficient\" and the question ends with \"the ... is best\", perhaps that should be part of the problem statement. However, in the example provided by the user, such remarks were not included. Therefore, following the example, perhaps we should only include the main problem: \"show that...\", and list the assumptions. The optimality of the coefficient is part of the problem's context but not the actual statement to prove. However, the user's own approach mentions that they need to prove the inequality and that the coefficient is best. Therefore, perhaps in the problem statement, it's necessary to mention that the coefficient is the best possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to show that the inequality holds with that coefficient, and the fact that it's the best is an additional part. But in the user's example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91 under certain assumptions. So in this case, the problem is to prove the inequality with that coefficient under the given assumptions. The fact that it's the best coefficient might be an extra note but not part of the problem. However, the original problem's title says \"Seems to be the optimal coefficient...\", so perhaps the problem is to prove that this is the optimal coefficient. Wait, but the actual question is to \"show that the integral is less than or equal to this coefficient times the square of the integral.\" So maybe the optimality is part of the problem, i.e., not only to prove the inequality but also that this constant is the best possible. But in the user's example, the problem was just to prove divisibility. Therefore, perhaps here, the problem is to prove the inequality with the given coefficient, and the optimality is a separate part. However, in the original question, the user wrote \"show that...\" followed by the inequality, and then mentions that the coefficient is best. So perhaps the problem is two parts: first to show the inequality, and second to show that the coefficient is optimal. But since the example only includes the first part, maybe here we should only include the inequality part in the problem statement, and the optimality is an additional note but not part of the problem to prove. \n\nAlternatively, if the original problem's main task is to show the inequality with the given coefficient, then the problem statement is just that. The optimality is perhaps an additional challenge but not the main problem. However, the user's problem mentions \"the 423405/246064 is best\" as part of the question. Therefore, perhaps the problem is to both prove the inequality and show that this constant is the best possible. But in the example, only the divisibility was the problem. Therefore, to stay consistent with the example, perhaps the problem statement here is just the inequality, and the optimality is an additional remark. \n\nBut the original problem's title says \"Seems to be the optimal coefficient\", which might imply that proving optimality is part of the problem. However, the body of the question says \"show that [inequality]\" and then adds \"the ... is best\". So perhaps the problem is to show the inequality and that the constant is optimal. But in the example, only the inequality was included. Therefore, perhaps the user's intention is to have the problem part as showing the inequality with the coefficient, and the optimality is part of the problem. Alternatively, the problem is only the inequality, and the optimality is an extra note. \n\nGiven the example, where the problem was just the divisibility, even though the original might have had more context, perhaps here the problem statement is to show the inequality, and the assumptions are the conditions on f. The fact that the coefficient is optimal might be part of the problem's context but not the actual statement to prove. However, the user's original problem includes \"the ... is best\" in the question, so perhaps it's part of the problem. \n\nWait, looking at the user's original question:\n\n\"show that $$\\int_{0}^{1}f^2(x)dx\\le\\dfrac{423405}{246064}\\left(\\int_{0}^{1}f(x)dx\\right)^2$$ My approach: it Seems to be looking for a polynomial $P(x)$ ,where $\\deg(P(x))=4$ ,such $$\\int_{0}^{1}P(x)dx=\\dfrac{423405}{246064}，P(x)\\ge 0,P'(0)\\ge 0,P'(1)\\le 0,$$ We just have to prove the following inequality $$\\int_{0}^{1}f^2(x)dx-\\int_{0}^{1}P(x)dx\\cdot \\left(\\int_{0}^{1}f(x)dx\\right)^2\\le 0$$ The next step would be to formulate the Integrand, or use Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, but that seems difficult New add it: the $\\dfrac{423405}{246064}$ is best\"\n\nSo the user's original problem includes the request to show the inequality, and then in the \"New add it\" part, mentions that the coefficient is best. So perhaps the main problem is to show the inequality, and the optimality is an additional part. But the example given by the user didn't include such a note. Therefore, perhaps in the formatted problem, we should include both parts. However, the example only included the main problem. \n\nBut the user's instruction says: \"structure that problem as the following format\" with the example. The example only included the main problem, not additional parts. Therefore, perhaps here, the problem is to \"show that...\" the inequality holds, and the assumptions are the conditions on f. The optimality of the coefficient is part of the problem's context but not the actual problem statement. Therefore, in the formatted problem, we should list the assumptions and the problem as the inequality to prove. The \"is best\" part might be extra information but not part of the problem statement. However, the user included \"is best\" in their problem statement. So perhaps to follow their example, we should include it. But the example didn't have such a note. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants the problem to include that it's the optimal coefficient. In the title, it's mentioned, and in the problem statement. Therefore, perhaps the problem should be \"Show that ... and that this coefficient is optimal\" or similar. But the example didn't have that. \n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. Given the example, the problem part was just the main statement. So perhaps here, the problem is to show the inequality, and the assumptions are the conditions on f. The fact that the coefficient is best is part of the problem's context but not the actual problem statement. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the problem part is \"Show that [inequality]\" with the given assumptions. \n\nSo, to structure this:\n\nAssumption: f ∈ C⁴[0,1]\n\nAssumption: f(x) ≥ 0 for all x ∈ [0,1]\n\nAssumption: f'(0) ≥ 0\n\nAssumption: f'(1) ≤ 0\n\nAssumption: f''''(x) ≥ 0 for all x ∈ [0,1]\n\nProblem: Show that ∫₀¹ f²(x) dx ≤ (423405/246064) (∫₀¹ f(x) dx)²\n\nBut the user's example included in the problem statement the divisibility, but in the original problem, the user added an assumption (n divisible by 7) which wasn't in the original. Wait, that's confusing. In the example, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like an error. But perhaps the user intended to modify the original problem's assumptions. Therefore, maybe the user's example is not reliable. However, the instruction is to follow the example. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's example was a mistake, and the actual task is to list all the assumptions present in the original problem. In the current problem, the original problem's assumptions are:\n\n- f ∈ C⁴[0,1]\n- f(x) ≥ 0 for all x ∈ [0,1]\n- f'(0) ≥ 0\n- f'(1) ≤ 0\n- f''''(x) ≥ 0 for all x ∈ [0,1]\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The problem is to show the integral inequality. Therefore, the formatted problem should list each of these assumptions line by line, and the problem is to show the inequality. The optimality of the coefficient is part of the problem's context but not the actual statement to prove. However, the user's problem includes \"the ... is best\" in the question. So maybe the problem is to show that this coefficient is the best possible, i.e., that there exists a function f satisfying the assumptions for which equality holds. But the problem as stated is to show the inequality. \n\nAlternatively, the problem is to both prove the inequality and show that the coefficient cannot be improved, i.e., is the smallest possible. If that's the case, then the problem statement would be: \"Show that [...] and that the constant 423405/246064 is the smallest possible.\" But the original problem's main statement is to show the inequality. The optimality is an additional part. However, in the user's example, only the main problem was included. Therefore, to follow the example, perhaps the problem is just the inequality. \n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem should have the five assumptions listed, each on a separate line, and the problem part is to show the integral inequality.",
