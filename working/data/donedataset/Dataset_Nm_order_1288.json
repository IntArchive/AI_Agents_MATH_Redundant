    "Content": "Is there a succinct proof for the fact that the rank of a non-zero skew-symmetric matrix ($A = -A^T$)  is at least 2? I can think of a proof by contradiction: Assume rank is 1. Then you express all other rows as multiple of the first row. Using skew-symmetric property, this matrix has to be a zero matrix. Why does such a matrix have at least 2 non-zero eigenvalues?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "For a skew symmetric (real) matrix, the eigenvalues are all purely imaginary.  This is because if $Av = \\lambda v$, then we have $\\lambda \\langle v,v\\rangle = \\langle \\lambda v, v\\rangle = \\langle Av,v\\rangle = \\langle v, -Av \\rangle = \\langle v, -\\lambda v\\rangle = -\\overline{\\lambda} \\langle v,v\\rangle$, so we conclude that $\\lambda = -\\overline{\\lambda}$, i.e., that $\\lambda$ is purely imaginary.  Here, we're using an Hermitian inner product. For a real matrix, complex eigenvalues come in conjugate pairs, so the rank must be even.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe original question is about proving that the rank of a non-zero skew-symmetric matrix is at least 2. The user mentioned a proof by contradiction where assuming rank 1 leads to the matrix being zero, which contradicts it being non-zero. Also, there's a part about eigenvalues, but maybe that's part of the original question's thoughts, not the core problem.\n\nSo, the key points here are: \n1. The matrix is skew-symmetric, meaning A = -A^T.\n2. The matrix is non-zero.\n3. The problem is to prove that its rank is at least 2.\n\nThe example given in the prompt had assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property. So for this problem, the assumptions would be that the matrix is skew-symmetric and non-zero. The problem is to prove the rank is at least 2. I should check if there are any other implicit assumptions. The user didn't specify the field, but typically skew-symmetric matrices over the real numbers have certain properties. However, since the question doesn't mention the field, maybe we don't need to assume that. The core assumptions are just the two.\n\nWait, the original problem's title is \"Proof that the rank of a skew-symmetric matrix is at least 2\". The question body reiterates that it's a non-zero skew-symmetric matrix. So the assumptions are that A is skew-symmetric (A = -A^T) and that A is non-zero. The problem is to prove rank is at least 2.\n\nTherefore, the formatted version should have two assumptions: one about being skew-symmetric, another about being non-zero. Then the problem statement.\n\nI need to make sure there are no other hidden assumptions. For example, the matrix size isn't mentioned, but skew-symmetric matrices have even rank if the field is of characteristic not 2. But maybe the problem is general, so the size isn't restricted. However, for the rank to be at least 2, the matrix must be at least 2x2. But the question doesn't specify the size; perhaps the assumption is that it's a square matrix (since skew-symmetric matrices are square by definition). So maybe another assumption is that A is a square matrix. Wait, but skew-symmetric matrices are always square because the transpose is involved. So perhaps the user doesn't need to state that, as it's implied by A = -A^T. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- A is a skew-symmetric matrix (A = -A^T)\n- A is a non-zero matrix\n\nProblem: Prove that the rank of A is at least 2.\n\nI think that's correct. The example given in the prompt had two assumptions as well. The original question mentions \"non-zero skew-symmetric matrix\", so both conditions are essential. The problem is to show rank ≥ 2. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list those two assumptions and the problem statement.",
