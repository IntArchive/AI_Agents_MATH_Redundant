    "Content": "Show that the eigenvalues of a unitary matrix have modulus $1$ . I know that a unitary matrix can be defined as a square complex matrix $A$ , such that $$AA^*=A^*A=I$$ where $A^*$ is the conjugate transpose of $A$ , and $I$ is the identity matrix. Furthermore, for a square matrix $A$ , the eigenvalue equation is expressed by $$Av=\\lambda v$$ If I use the relationship $(u v)^*=v^*{u^*}$ and take the conjugate transpose of this equation then $$v^*A^*=\\lambda^*v^*$$ But now I got stuck. Can someone help?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to show that the eigenvalues of a unitary matrix have modulus 1. First, I need to recall the definitions and properties related to unitary matrices and eigenvalues.\n\nA unitary matrix A satisfies the condition AA* = A*A = I, where A* is the conjugate transpose of A, and I is the identity matrix. Eigenvalues of a matrix A are scalars λ such that Av = λv for some non-zero vector v. \n\nThe user mentioned starting by taking the conjugate transpose of the eigenvalue equation, leading to v*A* = λ*v*. Then, multiplying both sides by Av on the right. Let's see:\n\nStarting with Av = λv, taking conjugate transpose gives v*A* = λ*v*. If I multiply both sides of the original equation by v* on the left, I get v*Av = v*λv = λ(v*v). On the other hand, multiplying v*A* by Av gives (v*A*)(Av) = v*(A*A)v = v*Iv = v*v, since A is unitary (A*A = I). \n\nPutting it together: v*Av = λ(v*v) and also (v*A*)(Av) = v*v. But since v*Av is equal to λ(v*v), substituting into the second equation gives λ*(v*v) = v*v. Assuming v is non-zero, v*v ≠ 0, so we can divide both sides by v*v, leading to λ*λ = 1. Therefore, |λ|² = 1, which implies |λ| = 1.\n\nWait, let me check the steps again. When taking the conjugate transpose of Av = λv, it's v*A* = λ*v*. Then, multiplying by Av: v*A*Av. Since A is unitary, A*A = I, so this becomes v*Iv = v*v. But also, from v*A*Av = (λ*v*)(λv) = λ*λ v*v. Therefore, |λ|² v*v = v*v, leading to |λ|² = 1. Yep, that seems right. So the modulus of λ is 1. I think that's the standard proof. The key steps are using the definition of unitary matrices and manipulating the eigenvalue equation with conjugate transpose and inner products.",
