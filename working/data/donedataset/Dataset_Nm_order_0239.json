    "Content": "Question: Show that $\\pi_{1}({\\mathbb R}^{2} - {\\mathbb Q}^{2})$ is uncountable. Motivation: This is one of those problems that I saw in Hatcher and felt I should be able to do, but couldn't quite get there. What I Can Do: There are proofs of this being path connected (though, I'm not exactly in love with any of those proofs) and this tells us we can let any point be our base-point.  Now, let $p$ be some point in ${\\mathbb R}^{2} - {\\mathbb Q}^{2}$ and let's let this be our base-point.  We can take one path from $p$ to $q$ and a second one from $q$ to $p$, and it's not hard to show that if these paths are different then there is at least one rational on the \"inside\" of it.  Since there are uncountably many $q$, this would seem to imply uncountably many different elements of the fundamental group; the problem I'm having is showing that two loops like we've described are actually different!  For example, a loop starting at $p$ and passing through $q$ should be different from a loop starting at $p$ and passing through $q'$ for none of these points the same, for at least an uncountable number of elements $q'$.  Is there some construction I should be using to show these elements of the fundamental group are different?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "So now that Jacob has explained why the space is path connected let us finish the problem. In his explanation he points out that there are an uncountable number of lines passing through $p$ and an uncountable number of lines passing through $q$ and since we are removing only countably many points not all of these lines can hit a point in $\\mathbb{Q}^2$. So we can construct a path from $p$ to $q$ missing $\\mathbb{Q}^2$, in fact more than one path. That gives us a loop, inside this loop will be an element of $\\mathbb{Q}^2$ just by looking at the coordinates of $p$ and $q$. This shows that the loop is not contractible, ie it is a nontrivial element of $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{R}^2-\\mathbb{Q}^2)$. Now you can proceed to construct more loops passing through $p$ and $q$ that are not contractible or homotopic to the previously constructed loop by picking different line segments as above. Now just construct another path from $p$ to $q$ and notice that an element of $\\mathbb{Q}^2$ is inside each of your new loops (there should be at least 2 new loops, try drawing a picture). Does this help? Edit: Here is, in my mind, a clearer construction of uncountably many non-homotopic loops. Let $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^2-\\mathbb{Q}^2$ and $L$ a line in $\\mathbb{R}^2-\\mathbb{Q}^2$ not containing $p$. As established, there is a continuum of lines passing through $p$, and once we remove all of the ones passing through a point in $\\mathbb{Q}^2$ we still have uncountably many. All remaining lines, with one possible exception, intersect $L$ at distinct points. We are left with a triangle for each pair of distinct remaining lines passing through $p$. There is a rational point inside each of these triangles (maybe this is something that was unclear, let me know and I think I can make this part more explicit). There is no way to move \"homotope\" the triangle past one of the rational points so that it would be homotopic to any adjacent triangle. Suppose two \"loops\" created in this fashion were homotopic, and suppose further that the differ in the second line passing through $p$, then there would have to be a homotopy between two paths which enclose a point of $\\mathbb{Q}^2$ which is impossible. If you want I can draw a picture on my tablet and try and post. (I don't really know the proper way to go about posting such a picture.)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The task is to show that the fundamental group of ℝ² minus ℚ² is uncountable. Hmm, fundamental groups... right, the fundamental group π₁(X) is the set of loops based at a point modulo homotopy equivalence. So, for ℝ² - ℚ², we need to show that there are uncountably many distinct homotopy classes of loops.\n\nFirst, the user mentions that the space is path-connected, so the choice of basepoint doesn't matter. Let's pick a basepoint p. The idea proposed is to consider loops that go from p to some other point q and back, but ensuring that different q's give rise to non-homotopic loops. The problem the user is facing is showing that these loops are actually different in the fundamental group.\n\nThe user's approach involves taking different points q and q' and creating loops that pass through them. They mention that if the paths from p to q and back are different, then there's at least one rational point inside the loop. Wait, how does that work? If two paths from p to q and back form a loop, then the \"inside\" of the loop would enclose some area. Since ℚ² is dense in ℝ², any such enclosed area would contain rational points unless the loop is contractible. But if the loop isn't contractible, maybe the number of enclosed rationals affects the homotopy class?\n\nBut how do we formalize that different loops enclose different rationals, leading to uncountably many homotopy classes? Maybe each loop can be associated with a set of rational points it encloses, and if two loops enclose different sets, they can't be homotopic. But how to ensure that each loop corresponds to a unique set, and that there are uncountably many such sets?\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a cardinality argument. The fundamental group is a group, and if it's uncountable, then it must have uncountable cardinality. But how to construct uncountably many distinct elements?\n\nWait, another approach: since ℝ² - ℚ² is a subspace of the plane with all rational points removed, it's similar to a plane with infinitely many punctures. However, normally, the fundamental group of a plane with countably many punctures is a free group with countably many generators. But here, the punctures are dense. Maybe the usual Van Kampen's theorem doesn't apply because the space isn't a wedge of circles or something nice.\n\nWait, but in this case, the punctures are everywhere dense. So any loop would have to wind around some irrational points? Wait, no, the fundamental group is about homotopy classes of loops, but in a space where around every rational point, there's a hole. But since the rationals are dense, any loop has to avoid them, but how can a loop wind around a hole if the hole is at a rational point? But since the loop is continuous and the rationals are dense, any small disk around a point contains rationals. So maybe loops can't wind around individual rational points because they can't be \"isolated\"?\n\nHmm, maybe I need a different strategy. The user mentioned something about taking different paths through different q's (points in ℝ² - ℚ²) and showing that loops passing through different q's are not homotopic. The idea is that if you have two different loops, the region between them must contain a rational point, which would prevent a homotopy between them. But how to make that precise?\n\nSuppose we have two loops γ and γ' based at p. If they are not homotopic, then there must exist some rational point inside the region bounded by their concatenation. Wait, maybe using the winding number around rational points? But since rational points are removed, any loop can't actually wind around them because they're not in the space. Wait, but the winding number around a point not in the space is still defined, right? For example, in ℝ² - {point}, the winding number around that point is an integer. So maybe here, each loop has a winding number around each rational point, but since the loop is in ℝ² - ℚ², the winding number around any rational point is zero? Because the loop doesn't go around any individual rational point, since they're all removed. Wait, but if a loop encloses a rational point, then the winding number around that point would be non-zero, but since the loop is in the complement, the winding number is undefined? Or is it still defined?\n\nWait, the winding number around a point q is defined for loops in ℝ² - {q}. So if a loop is in ℝ² - ℚ², then for each rational point q ∈ ℚ², the loop is in ℝ² - {q}, so the winding number around q is an integer. However, since the loop is in the complement of all rationals, how does the winding number behave? If the loop doesn't enclose any rational points, the winding number is zero. But if it does enclose some, then the winding number would be non-zero. But since the rationals are dense, any loop that encloses an area must enclose infinitely many rational points. But how can a loop enclose a specific set of rational points if they are dense?\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe the key is that even though the rationals are dense, you can still have loops that enclose different \"collections\" of rational points in a way that can't be homotoped to each other. For example, suppose you have two loops such that there's a rational point inside one loop but not the other. Then there can't be a homotopy between them because that would require passing through the rational point. So each loop can be associated with the set of rational points it encloses, and if two loops differ in at least one such point, they are not homotopic.\n\nBut the problem is that any loop in the plane encloses a region (by Jordan curve theorem if it's a simple loop), and that region would contain infinitely many rationals. So maybe instead of individual points, we need another invariant. Wait, but if we can somehow assign to each loop a function from ℚ² to ℤ, which is the winding number around each rational point. Then two loops are homotopic only if their winding numbers around every rational point are equal. Since ℚ² is countable, the set of functions from ℚ² to ℤ has cardinality continuum (since 2^ℵ₀ = 𝔠). But if we can show that the fundamental group maps injectively into this set of functions, then the fundamental group has cardinality at least continuum, hence uncountable.\n\nYes, this seems like a possible approach. Each element of π₁(X) would give a function from ℚ² to ℤ, assigning to each rational point the winding number of the loop around it. If two loops are homotopic in X, then their winding numbers around every rational point must be the same. Therefore, if we can construct loops with different winding numbers around some rational points, they would represent different elements in π₁(X). \n\nTo get uncountably many elements, we need to show that there are uncountably many distinct functions from ℚ² to ℤ arising from loops. Since ℚ² is countable, the set of functions ℚ² → ℤ has cardinality |ℤ|^ℵ₀ = 2^ℵ₀ = 𝔠, which is uncountable. However, not all functions are realizable by loops. But maybe we can construct a family of loops where each loop winds around a distinct subset of rational points. For example, for each real number, pick a different rational point to wind around. But since the reals are uncountable, this could work.\n\nWait, another way: use the fact that you can have for each irrational number (say between 0 and 1), a loop that winds around a specific rational point corresponding to that irrational. But I need to be careful. Alternatively, use binary expansions. For each subset of ℚ², assign a loop that winds around the points in the subset. But obviously, we can't do that for all subsets, but maybe enough to get uncountable.\n\nAlternatively, take an uncountable set of points in ℝ² - ℚ², say along the x-axis at (r, 0) where r is irrational. Then for each such r, create a loop that goes around the rational points (q, 0) where q < r. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe think of the space as similar to the Hawaiian earring, where you have a countable number of circles shrinking to a point. The fundamental group of the Hawaiian earring is known to be uncountable. But in our case, the space is ℝ² - ℚ², which is like a plane with a countable dense set of holes. The Hawaiian earring has a specific arrangement, but maybe our space has a complicated enough topology to have an uncountable fundamental group.\n\nAlternatively, the fundamental group of ℝ² - ℚ² is isomorphic to the free group on uncountably many generators, but I need to verify.\n\nWait, perhaps using a theorem from topology that if a space has uncountably many pairwise disjoint open subsets, then its fundamental group is uncountable. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, use homotopy classes of loops that can be distinguished by some invariant.\n\nGoing back to the winding number idea. Suppose we fix an enumeration of ℚ² as q₁, q₂, q₃, etc. Then for each sequence of integers (a₁, a₂, a₃, ...), we want to construct a loop whose winding number around q_i is a_i. If we can do this, then the fundamental group surjects onto the product space ℤ^ℕ, which has cardinality continuum. Hence, the fundamental group is at least of cardinality continuum. But in reality, not every sequence is achievable, but maybe we can construct uncountably many distinct sequences.\n\nAlternatively, consider for each real number α, take a loop that winds around q_n exactly f(α)_n times, where f: ℝ → ℤ^ℕ is an injective function. But constructing such loops might be non-trivial.\n\nBut perhaps there's a simpler way. Take an uncountable family of loops such that for any two loops in the family, there exists a rational point q such that their winding numbers around q are different. Then these loops must represent distinct elements in the fundamental group. Hence, if we can construct such a family, we're done.\n\nHow to construct such a family? Let's consider points along the x-axis. Let's take an uncountable set of irrational numbers, say S ⊂ ℝ \\ ℚ with |S| = 𝔠. For each s ∈ S, consider the rational numbers less than s and greater than s. For each s, construct a loop that goes around all rational points (q, 0) where q < s. But how to make this precise?\n\nAlternatively, for each s ∈ S, let’s create a loop that winds once around each rational point (q, 0) with q < s and does not wind around those with q > s. However, winding around infinitely many points is problematic because a loop can only wind around finitely many points in a continuous manner. So maybe this approach doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, use a Cantor set-like diagonal argument. Suppose we have a countable set of rational points. For each real number in [0,1], write its binary expansion and assign a winding number of 1 or 0 around each q_n depending on the nth digit. But again, constructing such a loop that winds around exactly those q_n where the nth digit is 1 is not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, for each irrational s, create a loop that encircles s and some rationals near it in a way that different s's give different winding numbers. But I need to think of how to do that.\n\nWait, maybe using paths that differ by linking different rational points. For example, consider two points q and q' in ℚ². If a loop goes around q but not q', then it can't be homotopic to a loop that goes around q' but not q. So if we can associate each real number with a unique sequence of such q's, then we get uncountably many loops.\n\nAlternatively, take an uncountable set of pairwise disjoint disks each containing a different rational point. Then, for each disk, create a loop that goes around that disk. But since ℚ² is dense, you can't have uncountably many disjoint disks in ℝ².\n\nHmm, this is getting tangled. Let's go back to the original idea in the question: using different points q in ℝ² - ℚ² to create loops. The user suggests that if you have two different paths from p to q and back, then the loop encloses at least one rational. If we can ensure that different q's lead to loops that must enclose different rationals, then each loop corresponds to a unique rational, but since there are countably many rationals, that wouldn't give uncountable. But the user wants to show that even though there are countably many rationals, the way loops enclose them leads to uncountably many homotopy classes.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is not individual rationals, but the pattern or the combination. For instance, for each real number, take a decimal expansion and create a loop that, for each digit, winds around a corresponding rational point. But this is vague.\n\nAlternatively, think of the fundamental group as a projective limit of groups. Since ℝ² - ℚ² can be written as the intersection of ℝ² - F where F ranges over finite subsets of ℚ². Each ℝ² - F has fundamental group free group on |F| generators. The projective limit of these groups as F increases would be some sort of inverse limit, which might be uncountable. But I'm not sure about this approach.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that the fundamental group of a non-compact space can be uncountable. For example, the fundamental group of the Hawaiian earring is uncountable, as mentioned earlier. Since ℝ² - ℚ² is a similar non-compact space with infinitely many holes, perhaps its fundamental group is also uncountable.\n\nBut how to make this rigorous? In the Hawaiian earring, each loop can be associated with a sequence of integers, representing the winding number around each circle. The fundamental group is then a subgroup of the product of countably many copies of ℤ, which is uncountable. Similarly, in our case, perhaps each loop can be associated with a sequence of winding numbers around each rational point, leading to an uncountable fundamental group.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to showing that the map from π₁(X) to the product space ∏_{q∈ℚ²} π₁(ℝ² - {q}) is injective. Since each ℝ² - {q} has fundamental group ℤ, the product is ℤ^ℵ₀, which is uncountable. If the map is injective, then π₁(X) is uncountable.\n\nTo show injectivity, suppose two loops are homotopic in X. Then they are homotopic in each ℝ² - {q} individually, so their images in the product are equal. Conversely, if their images are equal, then they are homotopic in each ℝ² - {q}, but does that imply they are homotopic in X? Not necessarily, unless the homotopies can be combined. However, injectivity would require that if two loops are homotopic in each ℝ² - {q}, then they are homotopic in X. This might not hold, but perhaps the contrapositive: if two loops are not homotopic in X, then there exists some q where they are not homotopic in ℝ² - {q}, meaning their winding numbers around q differ. Hence, the map is injective.\n\nTherefore, π₁(X) embeds into the uncountable group ℤ^ℵ₀, making it uncountable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the key assumptions are the properties of the space ℝ² - ℚ², path-connectedness allowing a single basepoint, and the relationship between loops and winding numbers around rational points. The problem then is to show that the fundamental group is uncountable, likely by demonstrating an injective homomorphism into an uncountable group or constructing uncountably many non-homotopic loops using winding numbers.",
