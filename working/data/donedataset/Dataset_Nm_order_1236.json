    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The user provided an example where they listed assumptions and then the problem. The original question is about proving a specific identity involving trilogarithms. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem mentions that Ramanujan gave certain identities for the Dilogarithm function, and now the user is asking about similar identities for the trilogarithm. The specific equation in question is (1), which they found numerically but couldn't find in literature. \n\nLooking at the problem statement, the user wants to prove that the combination of trilogarithms equals the given expression involving log^3 3, pi^2, log 3, and the Riemann zeta function at 3. The assumptions here would be the properties or conditions applied to the objects in the problem. The objects here are the trilogarithm functions Li_3(-1/3) and Li_3(1/3), and the right-hand side expression. \n\nSince the problem is about proving an identity, the assumptions would likely involve the definitions or known properties of trilogarithms. However, in the example provided, the assumptions were about the variable n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, there's no variable specified, but perhaps the assumptions relate to the properties of the trilogarithm function that the user is expected to use. However, the problem as stated doesn't explicitly list any given conditions beyond the numerical verification. The user is asking if this identity is new and how to prove it. \n\nBut according to the format, the assumption section should list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. In the original example, they had two assumptions about n. Here, maybe the key points are that the equation involves trilogarithms evaluated at -1/3 and 1/3, and that the identity is conjectured based on numerical evidence. However, the user isn't stating any explicit assumptions beyond the numerical agreement.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to prove the given identity, and the assumptions are implicit in the context. But the example shows that assumptions can be conditions on variables. Here, maybe the assumption is that the trilogarithm functions satisfy certain functional equations or relations similar to the dilogarithm ones provided by Ramanujan. But the user hasn't stated any such assumptions; they are asking if equation (1) is a known result and how to prove it. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to accept that equation (1) holds numerically and then prove it, so the assumption is that equation (1) is true based on numerical evidence, but that's not really a mathematical assumption. The problem is to prove the identity, so maybe there are no explicit assumptions here beyond the definitions of the trilogarithm and the constants involved.\n\nIn the example, they had assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7, which were part of the problem's conditions. Here, the problem doesn't specify any variables with conditions. Therefore, perhaps the assumption section is empty, but the format requires at least one assumption. Wait, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem included \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, looking back, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, that seems incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the correct assumption should be just \"n is an integer\". However, in the example, the user added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which might be a mistake. Or perhaps the example is altered for some reason.\n\nWait, maybe there was a mistake in the example. Let me check again. The original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem's assumption lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should just be \"n is an integer\". The divisibility by 7 isn't part of the original problem's assumption; it's part of the conclusion. Wait, that seems like an error. But perhaps the original example had a different problem? Wait, let me confirm. \n\nIn the example, the original problem is to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But if the original problem is for every integer n, then the assumption should only be that n is an integer, and the conclusion is that 91 divides A(n). However, in the example, they added \"n is divisible by 7\", which might be a mistake. That suggests that maybe the user made an error in their example, possibly confusing the problem's conclusion with an assumption. \n\nBut regardless, following the user's example, perhaps the task is to list all the conditions that the problem's objects must satisfy. So for the current problem, the user is asking to prove equation (1). The equation involves trilogarithms evaluated at -1/3 and 1/3. The assumptions here would be that these trilogarithm functions are defined and satisfy certain properties, but the problem as stated doesn't specify any particular conditions beyond their definitions. However, in the example, they included conditions on n even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So maybe in this case, we need to extract implicit assumptions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe since the problem is to prove an identity, the assumption is that the trilogarithm functions have certain known properties or functional equations, but since the user is asking how to prove it, those might not be given. Hence, perhaps the only assumption here is the numerical verification, but that's not a mathematical assumption. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a typo or missing information. Wait, the original problem is about proving that a combination of trilogarithms equals a specific expression. The assumptions could be the identities for the dilogarithm provided by Ramanujan, but the problem is about trilogarithms. However, the user is asking if equation (1) is new and how to prove it. \n\nWait, the example given by the user included assumptions about the variable n. Here, there is no variable; the equation is an identity. So maybe there are no explicit assumptions, but according to the format, we have to list assumptions. Perhaps the assumption is that the trilogarithm function is defined at -1/3 and 1/3, which they are. But that's trivial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is presented in a context where certain known identities for trilogarithms are assumed, but the user hasn't specified any. \n\nGiven that the example might have been incorrectly formatted, but following the user's instruction to structure the problem as in the example, perhaps in this case, since the original problem does not state any explicit assumptions beyond the functions involved, the assumption section would list the definitions of the trilogarithm functions involved. However, in the example, the assumptions were about the variable n. Here, since there are no variables, maybe there are no assumptions. But the format requires an assumption section. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem's assumption is that the equation holds numerically, but that's not a mathematical assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to accept that the identity is true (as per numerical verification) and prove it, but that's not standard. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumption is the validity of the dilogarithm identities provided by Ramanujan, but the problem is about trilogarithms, so those might not be directly relevant. However, maybe the user is implying that similar techniques as in the dilogarithm case can be applied. But that's speculative. \n\nGiven the original problem's structure, perhaps the correct way to format this is:\n\nAssumption: The trilogarithm function $\\text{Li}_3$ is defined at $-\\frac{1}{3}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nBut that seems trivial. Alternatively, perhaps there are no explicit assumptions beyond the functions being trilogarithms. Alternatively, if we follow the example where even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", they listed \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\", which seems incorrect, maybe in this case, the problem is being presented as an identity that needs to be proven, with the assumption that the trilogarithm functions satisfy certain properties. But without more information, it's hard to say. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to prove the identity under the assumption that it holds numerically, but that's not a standard mathematical assumption. \n\nGiven the example's structure, even if the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7, the user added it as an assumption. So maybe here, even if the problem doesn't state any assumptions, we need to infer them. However, in this case, the problem is an identity, so the assumptions would be the definitions and properties of the trilogarithm function. But since the user hasn't specified any particular properties, perhaps we list the points as:\n\nAssumption:\nThe function $\\text{Li}_3$ is the trilogarithm function,\nEquation (1) holds numerically to many decimal places.\n\nBut the second part is more of a motivation than a mathematical assumption. Since the user is asking to prove the identity, the real assumptions would be mathematical properties of the trilogarithm. But without specific given properties, perhaps the only assumption is that the trilogarithm is defined at those points. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no explicit assumptions needed here, but the format requires assumptions. To comply with the example, perhaps we have to list the problem's elements as assumptions. But the example had two assumptions for a problem involving a variable. Here, since there are no variables, perhaps the assumptions are about the functions and constants involved. \n\nWait, looking back at the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, and the formatted problem had assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But actually, 91 is 7*13, so perhaps the original problem might require n to be divisible by both 7 and 13, but in the example, the user only listed divisible by 7. That might be an error. However, following the user's example, even if the original problem's assumptions are different, we need to follow their structure.\n\nIn the current problem, since there are no variables, the assumptions might be about the functions and the constants. However, the problem is to prove an equality, so perhaps the assumptions are the definitions of the trilogarithm and the constants involved. But the example's assumptions were about the variable's properties. Since there's no variable here, perhaps we can list that the trilogarithm functions are evaluated at -1/3 and 1/3, but that's part of the problem statement. \n\nGiven that the example included an assumption that n is divisible by 7 even if the original problem didn't state that, perhaps in this case, the assistant should list the necessary conditions for the identity to hold, but the problem doesn't specify any. Therefore, perhaps the only assumption is that the trilogarithm function is defined at the given points, but that's inherent to the problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes knowledge of certain trilogarithm identities, but that's not stated. Since the user is asking how to prove it, perhaps there are no given assumptions beyond standard mathematical definitions. \n\nIn the absence of clear assumptions, perhaps the best approach is to follow the example's structure even if it's not perfect. Since the example included assumptions about the variable, here we might have to leave the assumption section empty, but the format requires it. Alternatively, state that there are no explicit assumptions beyond standard mathematical definitions. However, according to the user's example, they transformed \"for every integer n\" into an assumption \"n is an integer\", and added \"n is divisible by 7\" which wasn't in the original problem. That seems incorrect. Perhaps the user made a mistake in their example. Therefore, maybe in the current problem, we should list the assumptions as:\n\nAssumption:\nThe function $\\text{Li}_3$ is the trilogarithm function.\n\nBut that's redundant since the problem mentions trilogarithm. Alternatively, since the problem references similar identities for the dilogarithm, perhaps the assumption is that similar methods apply, but that's not stated. \n\nAlternatively, given that the problem is to prove the identity, and the example included assumptions about the variable, perhaps here, since there's no variable, the assumption section can be left with just the problem. But according to the format, it's required. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem's assumptions are the numerical verification, but that's not a mathematical assumption. \n\nGiven the user's example seems to have an error, but following their structure, perhaps in this case, since there are no variables, we can list the problem as is. However, the problem statement in the example included the divisibility by 7 as an assumption, which might not have been present in the original problem. Therefore, perhaps the user wants to extract all conditions from the problem. Here, the problem is to prove the given equation involving trilogarithms. The only conditions are that the trilogarithm is evaluated at -1/3 and 1/3. So perhaps the assumptions are the points at which the trilogarithm is evaluated. But that's part of the problem statement. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to separate the problem into parts. But given the example's inconsistency, I might need to proceed carefully. \n\nIn conclusion, given the ambiguity, the safest way is to list the problem's components as assumptions. However, since the example included variable conditions, and this problem has none, perhaps the assumption section is empty. But the format requires it. Alternatively, the assumption is that the trilogarithm function is defined at those points, which is trivial. Given that, I'll proceed to structure the problem as follows:\n\nAssumption: \nThe function $\\text{Li}_3$ is the trilogarithm function,\nThe equation (1) holds numerically to many decimal places.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$\\text{Li}_3\\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\right)-2 \\text{Li}_3\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)= -\\frac{\\log^3 3}{6}+\\frac{\\pi^2}{6}\\log 3-\\frac{13\\zeta(3)}{6}.$$\n\nHowever, the second assumption about numerical agreement is more of a motivation than an assumption. Alternatively, since the problem is to prove the identity, perhaps the only assumption is the definition of the trilogarithm. \n\nGiven that, I think the correct way is:\n\nAssumption: \n$\\text{Li}_3$ denotes the trilogarithm function.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$\\text{Li}_3\\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\right)-2 \\text{Li}_3\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)= -\\frac{\\log^3 3}{6}+\\frac{\\pi^2}{6}\\log 3-\\frac{13\\zeta(3)}{6}.$$\n\nBut in the example, they had two assumptions for the variable n. Here, since there's no variable, perhaps the only assumption is the function's definition. However, in the example, they split into two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Here, since there's only one object (the trilogarithm function), maybe only one assumption. But the user's example split into two even though both were about n. So perhaps each assumption must address one property or condition of one object. Since the trilogarithm function is one object, perhaps just one assumption. However, the problem also involves the Riemann zeta function at 3, so maybe another assumption that ζ(3) is the Riemann zeta function evaluated at 3. But that's also standard. \n\nAlternatively, to follow the example's style, perhaps list each component:\n\nAssumption:\n$\\text{Li}_3$ is the trilogarithm function,\n$\\zeta(3)$ is the Riemann zeta function evaluated at 3,\n$\\log$ denotes the natural logarithm,\n$\\pi$ is the mathematical constant.\n\nBut these are all standard definitions, and the example didn't include such basic assumptions. Therefore, perhaps it's redundant. Given the user's example included only the variable conditions, maybe here, since there are no variables, the assumption section can be empty. But the format requires it. Therefore, perhaps the assumption is just the function definitions. \n\nAlternatively, if we take the example's approach where the original problem's variable condition was split into two assumptions, here maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n$\\text{Li}_3$ is the trilogarithm function,\n$\\text{Li}_3$ is evaluated at $-\\frac{1}{3}$,\n$\\text{Li}_3$ is evaluated at $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nBut this seems unnecessarily granular. However, the example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. Following that pattern, here, each evaluation point could be an assumption. But that's not standard. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, I think the best approach is to follow the example's style, even if it's not perfect. Since the example included variable properties, here, given no variables, perhaps list the relevant functions and constants as assumptions. But in the example, they didn't list the function A(n) as an assumption. Therefore, perhaps it's better to keep the assumption section minimal. Given that, I'll proceed with:\n\nAssumption: \n$\\text{Li}_3$ is the trilogarithm function.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$\\text{Li}_3\\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\right)-2 \\text{Li}_3\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)= -\\frac{\\log^3 3}{6}+\\frac{\\pi^2}{6}\\log 3-\\frac{13\\zeta(3)}{6}.$$",
