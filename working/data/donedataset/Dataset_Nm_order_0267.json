    "Content": "I need to prove the following, but I am not able to do it. This is not homework, nor something related to research, but rather something that came up in preparation for an exam. If $n = 1 + m$, where $m$ is the product of four consecutive positive\n  integers, prove that $n$ is a perfect square. Now since $m = p(p+1)(p+2)(p+3)$; $p = 0, n = 1$ - Perfect Square $p = 1, n = 25$ - Perfect Square $p = 2, n = 121$ - Perfect Square Is there any way to prove the above without induction? My approach was to expand $m = p(p+1)(p+2)(p+3)$ into a 4th degree equation, and then try proving that $n = m + 1$ is a perfect square, but I wasn't able to do it. Any idea if it is possible?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Your technique should have worked, but if you don't know which expansions to do first you can get yourself in a tangle of algebra and make silly mistakes that bring the whole thing crashing down. The way I reasoned was, well, I have four numbers multiplied together, and I want it to be two numbers of the same size multiplied together. So I'll try multiplying the big one with the small one, and the two middle ones. $$p(p+1)(p+2)(p+3) + 1 = (p^2 + 3p)(p^2 + 3p + 2) + 1$$ Now those terms are nearly the same. How can we force them together? I'm going to use the basic but sometimes-overlooked fact that $xy = (x+1)y - y$, and likewise $x(y + 1) = xy + x$. $$\\begin{align*}\n(p^2 + 3p)(p^2 + 3p + 2) + 1 &= (p^2 + 3p + 1)(p^2 + 3p + 2) - (p^2 + 3p + 2) + 1 \\\\\n &= (p^2 + 3p + 1)(p^2 + 3p + 1) + (p^2 + 3p + 1) - (p^2 + 3p + 2) + 1 \\\\\n &= (p^2 + 3p + 1)^2\n\\end{align*}$$\nTada.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants to prove that if you take the product of four consecutive positive integers and add one, the result is a perfect square. The example given uses p as the starting integer, so the product is p(p+1)(p+2)(p+3), then adding 1 gives n, which they claim is a perfect square. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The problem states that m is the product of four consecutive positive integers. Then n is 1 plus m, and they need to prove n is a perfect square. Let me break this down into individual assumptions. Each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nAssumption 1: p is a positive integer. (Because the problem says \"four consecutive positive integers\", so p must be a positive integer.)\n\nAssumption 2: m is the product of four consecutive integers starting from p. So m = p(p+1)(p+2)(p+3).\n\nAssumption 3: n is equal to m + 1. So n = m + 1.\n\nThe problem then is to prove that n is a perfect square. \n\nWait, the original problem statement says \"n = 1 + m, where m is the product of four consecutive positive integers.\" So the user is assuming p is a positive integer, and m is the product of p, p+1, p+2, p+3, then n = m + 1. So the three assumptions are about p being a positive integer, m being that product, and n being m + 1. Then the problem is to prove n is a perfect square.\n\nIn the example given by the user, when p=0, n=1, which is a square. But p is supposed to be a positive integer here, so maybe p starts at 1. Wait, the user's example includes p=0, but the problem states \"four consecutive positive integers\", so p=0 would lead to product 0*1*2*3=0, which is allowed? Wait, the problem says \"positive integers\", so p must be at least 1. Because 0 is not positive. Hmm, but in the user's example, they include p=0, n=1. Maybe the original problem allows p to be 0, but the problem statement says \"four consecutive positive integers\", so p must be positive. Wait, the question's title says \"four consecutive positive integers\", but in the body, the user says \"p=0\", which contradicts. Maybe the problem as posed allows p to be zero. Wait, the original problem says: \"If n = 1 + m, where m is the product of four consecutive positive integers, prove that n is a perfect square.\" So m is the product of four consecutive positive integers. So p must be a positive integer. But the user's example includes p=0, leading to m=0, n=1. That's a square. So maybe the problem allows p to be zero as well. But the problem statement says \"four consecutive positive integers\", so if p=0, then the integers would be 0,1,2,3, but 0 is not positive. So perhaps the user made a mistake here. But since the user includes p=0, maybe the problem is actually about four consecutive non-negative integers? Hmm. Wait, the title says \"positive integers\", so the four integers must be positive. Therefore, p should be at least 1. But the user tested p=0, which gives n=1, which is a square. So perhaps the problem actually allows p to be a non-negative integer. But the problem statement says \"positive\". So there is ambiguity here. However, the user's original question includes p=0,1,2, etc., so perhaps the problem is more general, but the title says \"positive\". Maybe it's a mistake in the problem statement. To resolve this, perhaps the assumption is that p is a non-negative integer. Because the user is testing p=0. So maybe the actual problem allows p to be non-negative. But given that the title says \"positive\", there's a conflict. However, in the problem statement, the user wrote: \"If n = 1 + m, where m is the product of four consecutive positive integers, prove that n is a perfect square.\" So the product m is of four consecutive positive integers, meaning p must be a positive integer. Then p=1 gives 1*2*3*4=24, n=25=5². p=2 gives 2*3*4*5=120, n=121=11². But the user mentions p=0, which would be 0*1*2*3=0, n=1. But since 0 isn't positive, that case is not covered by the problem statement. So maybe the problem is intended to include p=0, but the problem statement is slightly incorrect. Alternatively, the user might have made a mistake in their example. \n\nBut to structure the problem as per the format, I need to extract the assumptions from the problem statement. The problem statement says m is the product of four consecutive positive integers. Therefore, p must be a positive integer, and the four integers are p, p+1, p+2, p+3. Then n = m + 1. So the assumptions would be:\n\n1. p is a positive integer.\n2. m is the product of four consecutive positive integers starting from p (i.e., m = p(p+1)(p+2)(p+3)).\n3. n is equal to m + 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that n is a perfect square.\n\nBut in the user's example, they tested p=0, which might not be part of the problem's intended scope. However, since the user included it, perhaps the problem allows p to be non-negative. But according to the problem statement, it's \"four consecutive positive integers\". So I think the correct assumptions are as above, with p being a positive integer. The user's example with p=0 is outside the problem's conditions, but maybe they were just testing edge cases. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list the assumptions as:\n\nAssumption:\np is a positive integer,\nm is the product of four consecutive integers starting from p,\nn is equal to m + 1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that n is a perfect square.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the user wrote \"If n = 1 + m, where m is the product of four consecutive positive integers, prove that n is a perfect square.\" So the four consecutive integers must be positive, hence p is a positive integer. So m = p(p+1)(p+2)(p+3) where p ≥ 1. Then n = m + 1. The problem is to prove n is a perfect square. \n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- p is a positive integer.\n- m is the product of four consecutive positive integers: p, p+1, p+2, p+3.\n- n is equal to m + 1.\n\nSo each assumption is on a separate line. Each addresses one property. Then the problem is to prove n is a perfect square.",
