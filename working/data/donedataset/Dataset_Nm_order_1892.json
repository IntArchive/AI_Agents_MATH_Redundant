    "Content": "Suppose $x$ and $y$ are angles measured in radians. Then how to show that the equation \n$$\\sin x+\\sin y=1$$\ndoes not have a solution $(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{N}\\times\\mathbb{N}$? This question is prompted by curiosity. I don't have any ideas how it can be approached.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "No, and there is not even a solution for $(x,y)\\in\\mathbb Q\\times \\mathbb Q$. We can quickly exclude $x=y$, which would require that $\\sin x=\\frac12$, but that is only true for $x=n\\frac{\\pi}{6}$ for certain nonzero integers $n$, and none of these produce a rational. Similarly we can easily exclude $x=0$, $y=0$, or $x=-y$. Now, using Euler's formula, rewrite the equation to\n$$ \\tag{*} e^{ix} + e^{iy} - e^{-ix} - e^{-iy} = 2i\\cdot e^0 $$\nand apply the Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem which in one formulation says that the exponentials of distinct algebraic numbers are linearly independent over the algebraic numbers. But $\\{\\pm ix,\\pm iy,0\\}$ are all algebraic and (by our assumptions so far) different, so $\\text{(*)}$ would be one of the linear relations that can't exist. This argument generalizes to show that the only algebraic number that can be written as a rational combination of sines of algebraic (radian) angles is $0$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem properly. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into their specified format. Let me start by understanding the original problem.\n\nThe original question is titled: \"Prove that sin x + sin y = 1 does not have integer solutions\". The user is asking how to show that there are no natural number solutions (x, y) in radians for this equation. They mention being stuck and not knowing how to approach it.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The example given lists each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let's look at the problem again:\n\nThe variables x and y are angles measured in radians. The equation is sin x + sin y = 1. The problem is to show there are no solutions where both x and y are natural numbers (i.e., positive integers). \n\nSo the assumptions here would be:\n\n1. x is a natural number.\n2. y is a natural number.\n3. x is measured in radians.\n4. y is measured in radians.\n\nEach of these is a separate condition applied to each object (x and y). The problem statement then is to prove that sin x + sin y = 1 has no solutions in natural numbers.\n\nWait, but in the example provided, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the formatted problem, that assumption was listed. However, in this case, the user's original problem states that x and y are in radians and are natural numbers. So those are the key assumptions. The fact that they are measured in radians is part of the problem's given conditions.\n\nBut wait, the example might have included an extra assumption (like n divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, no. Looking back: the original example had the problem statement saying \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like an error. Wait, no, maybe the user made a mistake in their example? Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the user's example, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that seems contradictory because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Maybe the example is incorrect, but the user wants me to follow their structure regardless.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user's original question states that x and y are in radians and are in natural numbers. So the assumptions here are:\n\n- x is a natural number (since the problem states (x,y) ∈ ℕ×ℕ)\n- y is a natural number\n- x is measured in radians\n- y is measured in radians\n\nBut wait, radians are the unit here, so the problem says they are angles measured in radians. So the key is that x and y are natural numbers (positive integers) but interpreted as angles in radians. So each of these is a separate assumption. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a natural number,\ny is a natural number,\nx is measured in radians,\ny is measured in radians.\n\nProblem: Prove that sin x + sin y = 1 does not have a solution (x, y) ∈ ℕ×ℕ.\n\nWait, but maybe \"measured in radians\" is redundant because in mathematics, angles in trigonometric functions without units specified are usually in radians. But since the problem explicitly mentions it, we should include it as an assumption.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have four assumptions, each on a separate line, and then the problem statement. Let me check again the example. The example's original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like the formatted problem added an assumption not present in the original problem. The original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. That's conflicting. Perhaps the example has a mistake. But regardless, the user wants me to structure the current problem correctly.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question states that x and y are angles measured in radians and that (x,y) are in ℕ×ℕ. So the key assumptions are:\n\n- x is a natural number (since ℕ is the set of natural numbers)\n- y is a natural number\n- x is measured in radians (explicitly stated)\n- y is measured in radians (explicitly stated)\n\nTherefore, each of these should be listed as separate assumptions. The problem is to show that the equation has no solutions under these conditions.",
