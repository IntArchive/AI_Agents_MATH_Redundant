    "Content": "I want to prove the following theorem (no idea whether it has a name): Let $V = \\mathbb{R}^n$ or $\\mathbb{C}^n$ and $\\|\\cdot\\|$ be a norm on $V$. Then, there exist $C_1, C_2 > 0$ such that for all $x \\in V$: $$C_1 \\|x\\|_\\infty \\leq \\|x\\| \\leq C_2 \\|x\\|_\\infty$$ I first let $x \\neq 0$ (otherwise it would be trivial). Then, I divided by $\\|x\\|_\\infty$ and normalized the vector $x$ such that $\\|x\\|_\\infty = 1$. That left me with $$C_1 \\leq \\|x\\| \\leq C_2$$ but I don't see how this could help me or how I could possibly limit an unknown norm. How can I proceed? Or is this the wrong way anyway? Thanks for any answers.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I try to make a self-contained answer to the question (more info can be found on this page ). The short answer is: yes you are on the right track! What you are missing: $\\|x\\|$ is a continuous function with respect to the $\\|\\cdot\\|_\\infty$ norm. You can write $x= \\sum_m x_m e_m$ with $e_m$ a basis with $\\|e_m\\|=1$ (similarly, $y= \\sum_m y_m e_m$ ). We are interested in $$\\|x-y\\| = \\left\\| \\sum_m (x_m - y_m) e_m \\right\\| \\leq \\sum_m | (x_m - y_m)|  \\leq n \\| x - y\\|_\\infty$$ using the triangle inequality. So for every $\\epsilon>0$ , we can choose a $\\delta =\\epsilon/n$ such that with $\\| x - y\\|_\\infty < \\delta$ it follows that $\\|x-y\\| < \\epsilon$ . Therefore, $\\|x\\|$ is $\\infty$ -continuous. The unit sphere $S= \\{x :\\|x\\|_\\infty = 1\\}$ is a compact set thereby $\\|x\\|$ assumes a minimum $C_1$ and a maximum $C_2$ on it.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that for any norm on ℝⁿ or ℂⁿ, there exist constants C₁ and C₂ such that C₁‖x‖∞ ≤ ‖x‖ ≤ C₂‖x‖∞ for all x. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The problem states that V is either ℝⁿ or ℂⁿ, and that ‖·‖ is a norm on V. The goal is to show the inequality with the infinity norm. The user tried normalizing x by setting ‖x‖∞ = 1, which simplifies the problem to finding C₁ ≤ ‖x‖ ≤ C₂ for all x with ‖x‖∞ = 1. \n\nWait, the key here might be that all norms on finite-dimensional vector spaces are equivalent. That's a theorem I remember. But the user is asking for a proof of this specific case between the given norm and the infinity norm. \n\nThe assumptions should list each condition. So first, V is ℝⁿ or ℂⁿ. Second, ‖·‖ is a norm on V. The problem is to show the existence of C₁ and C₂ such that the inequalities hold for all x in V.\n\nThe user mentioned normalizing x, so maybe the important step is using the compactness of the unit sphere in finite dimensions, since continuous functions on compact sets attain their extrema. Since norms are continuous, ‖x‖ would attain a minimum and maximum on the set where ‖x‖∞ = 1, which is compact. That would give the constants C₁ and C₂ as the min and max, respectively.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user hasn't assumed anything beyond V being ℝⁿ or ℂⁿ and ‖·‖ being a norm. So the assumptions should just be those two points. The problem is to prove the inequality with those two constants existing.",
