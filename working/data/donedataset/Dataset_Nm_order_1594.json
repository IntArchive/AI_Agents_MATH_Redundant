    "Content": "Let $\\mathscr{P} : \\textbf{Set} \\to \\textbf{Set}^\\textrm{op}$ be the (contravariant) powerset functor, taking a set $X$ to its powerset $\\mathscr{P}(X)$ and a map $f : X \\to Y$ to the inverse image map $f^* : \\mathscr{P}(Y) \\to \\mathscr{P}(X)$. By elementary abstract nonsense, we know that $\\mathscr{P}$ has a right adjoint $\\mathscr{P}^\\textrm{op}$: indeed, $$\\textrm{Hom}(X, \\mathscr{P}(Y)) \\cong \\textrm{Hom}(X \\times Y, \\Omega) \\cong \\textrm{Hom}\n(Y \\times X, \\Omega) \\cong \\textrm{Hom}(Y, \\mathscr{P}^\\textrm{op} (X)) $$ where $\\Omega$ is the subobject classifier $\\{ 0, 1 \\}$ for $\\textbf{Set}$. Let us write $\\mathscr{T}$ for the composite $\\mathscr{P}^\\textrm{op} \\mathscr{P}$; then we have a monad $(\\mathscr{T}, \\eta, \\mu)$ on $\\textbf{Set}$. By advanced  abstract nonsense (Paré's theorem or Mikkelsen's theorem) it can be shown that $\\mathscr{P}$ is monadic, i.e. that the canonical comparison functor $\\textbf{Set}^\\textrm{op} \\to \\mathscr{T}\\textbf{-Alg}$ is an equivalence of categories; but $\\textbf{Set}^\\textrm{op}$ is known to be equivalent to the category of complete atomic boolean algebras, so this therefore implies that a $\\mathscr{T}$-algebra is the same thing as a complete atomic boolean algebra. Question. How does one show this directly? It is straightforward to check that\n$$\\eta_X (x) = \\{ S \\subseteq X : x \\in S \\} = \\mathord{\\uparrow} (\\{ x \\})$$\nand the multiplication map is\n$$\\mu_X (V) = \\bigcup_{U \\in V} \\{ S \\subseteq X : \\eta_{\\mathscr{P} (X)}(S) = U \\}$$\nbut I am having a lot of trouble getting any intuition for what $\\mu_X$ does beyond how it is constructed: it recovers the set of all $S$ such that the principal filter $\\mathord{\\uparrow} (\\{ S \\})$ is a member of $V$. If $V$ itself is upwards-closed, then we have the formula\n$$\\mu_X (V) = \\bigcup_{U \\in V} \\bigcap_{T \\in U} T$$\nsince for all $U \\in V$, if $S \\in T$ for all $T \\in U$, we have $U \\subseteq \\mathord{\\uparrow}(\\{ S \\})$, i.e.\n$$U \\subseteq \\bigcap \\left\\{ \\mathord{\\uparrow}(\\{ S \\}) : S \\in \\bigcap U \\right\\}$$\nThus, for $U \\subseteq \\mathscr{T}(X)$,\n$$\\mu_X ( \\mathord{\\uparrow}(U) ) = \\bigcap_{T \\in U} T$$\nand as a special case we obtain the left unit law\n$$\\mu_X ( \\eta_{\\mathscr{T}(X)} (T) ) = T$$\nThis means that we can recover the meet operation of $\\mathscr{T}(X)$ from $\\mu_X$, regarded as the free complete atomic boolean algebra on $X$. We can also recover the join operation:\n$$\\bigcup_{T \\in U} T = \\mu_X \\left( \\bigcup \\left\\{ \\mathord{\\uparrow} (\\{ T \\}) : T \\in U \\right\\} \\right)$$\n(The use of $\\bigcup$ in the RHS is legitimate since the join operation of $\\mathscr{T}(\\mathscr{T}(X))$ independent of the join operation of $\\mathscr{T}(X)$.) Now, I know that any complete lattice $A$ admits a canonical pseudocomplement operation\n$$\\lnot a = \\bigvee \\{ a' \\in A : a \\wedge a' = \\bot \\}  $$\nbut I have no idea how the properties of $\\mu_X$ imply the ‘meet’ and ‘join’ operations we get satisfy the requirements for a (complete) boolean algebra, nor do I see where atomicity might be coming from.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The signature of complete atomic boolean algebras is the class of all functions $\\{0,1\\}^\\kappa \\to \\{0,1\\}$ , where $\\kappa$ can be any set. Up to canonical isomorphism, for any algebra $a:\\mathscr{P}^2X\\to X$ and any operator $P:\\{0,1\\}^\\kappa \\to \\{0,1\\}$ , we have: $$X^Y \\stackrel{(\\eta_X)^\\kappa}\\longrightarrow \\{0,1\\}^{\\mathscr PX\\times \\kappa} \\stackrel{P^{\\mathscr PX}}\\longrightarrow \\{0,1\\}^{\\mathscr P X} \\stackrel a \\longrightarrow X$$ This way every $\\#\\kappa$ -ary operation on $\\{0,1\\}$ is implemented on $X$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me start by reading through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe title is \"What are the algebras of the double powerset monad?\" The user is asking how to show directly that the algebras of the double powerset monad (denoted as 𝒯) are equivalent to complete atomic Boolean algebras. They mention that this can be inferred from abstract results like Paré's theorem but want a direct approach.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem is in category theory, specifically dealing with the powerset functor, adjunctions, and monads. The key elements here are:\n\n- The contravariant powerset functor 𝒫: Set → Set^op.\n- The right adjoint of 𝒫 is 𝒫^op, forming the composite monad 𝒯 = 𝒫^op ∘ 𝒫.\n- The monad (𝒯, η, μ) where η is the unit and μ is the multiplication.\n- The user has derived some formulas for η and μ, particularly noting that for an upwards-closed V, μ_X(V) can be expressed as the intersection over T in U for U ∈ V.\n- They also mention recovering meet and join operations from μ_X and the challenge in connecting these to complete atomic Boolean algebra axioms.\n\nAssumptions should be individual properties or conditions applied to one object each. Let's break down the given information:\n\n1. 𝒫: Set → Set^op is the contravariant powerset functor.\n2. 𝒫 has a right adjoint 𝒫^op, forming the adjunction 𝒫 ⊣ 𝒫^op.\n3. The composite functor 𝒯 = 𝒫^op ∘ 𝒫 forms a monad (𝒯, η, μ).\n4. η_X(x) = { S ⊆ X | x ∈ S } (the principal filter of {x}).\n5. μ_X(V) is defined as the union over U ∈ V of { S ⊆ X | η_{𝒫(X)}(S) = U }, which simplifies for upwards-closed V to intersections over T ∈ U.\n6. The goal is to show that 𝒯-algebras are equivalent to complete atomic Boolean algebras.\n\nThe problem is to show directly that a 𝒯-algebra is a complete atomic Boolean algebra, using the structure of the monad. The user struggles with connecting the monad's structure (unit and multiplication) to the required Boolean algebra properties and atomicity.\n\nNow, structuring this:\n\nAssumption: Each line should capture one condition. Let's list the components of the monad and their properties as assumptions.\n\nWait, the original problem doesn't state assumptions in the usual sense but sets up the context. Since the format requires listing assumptions, perhaps the components given in the problem setup are the assumptions. For example:\n\n- The powerset functor 𝒫 is contravariant.\n- 𝒫 has a right adjoint 𝒫^op.\n- The composite 𝒯 = 𝒫^op ∘ 𝒫 is a monad.\n- The unit η_X is defined as taking x to the principal filter of {x}.\n- The multiplication μ_X is defined as a certain union over elements of V.\n- For upwards-closed V, μ_X(V) can be expressed as the intersection over T ∈ U for U ∈ V.\n- The meet and join operations in 𝒯(X) can be recovered from μ_X.\n- The comparison functor Set^op → 𝒯-Alg is an equivalence.\n- Set^op is equivalent to the category of complete atomic Boolean algebras.\n\nBut the user's question is how to show directly that 𝒯-algebras are complete atomic Boolean algebras. The assumptions needed are the properties given about the monad, such as the structure of η and μ, and the adjunctions.\n\nBut maybe the key assumptions here are the definitions of η and μ, and the structure of the monad 𝒯. So each part of the monad structure would be an assumption.\n\nWait, the example given in the original instruction was an assumption like \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". So in the current problem, the assumptions would be the given conditions that the problem relies on. Since the user has already set up the monad and some properties, perhaps the assumptions are the components of the monad and the properties of η and μ that they've derived. However, the problem is to use these to show the equivalence.\n\nBut the user is asking how to do this, given the setup. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- 𝒯 is the double powerset monad (𝒫^op ∘ 𝒫).\n- The unit η_X sends x to the principal filter of {x}.\n- The multiplication μ_X has the specified form, especially for upwards-closed V.\n- The meet and join operations in 𝒯(X) can be recovered using μ_X.\n\nBut the problem is to show that the algebras of this monad are precisely the complete atomic Boolean algebras. The user is struggling with verifying the Boolean algebra axioms and atomicity from the monad structure.\n\nTherefore, in the Assumption section, we list the given structures and properties that are part of the problem setup. Each assumption should be a single condition applied to one object.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\n𝒯 is the composite functor 𝒫^op ∘ 𝒫 forming a monad (𝒯, η, μ),\nη_X(x) = { S ⊆ X : x ∈ S },\nμ_X(V) = ⋃_{U ∈ V} { S ⊆ X : η_{𝒫(X)}(S) = U } for V ∈ 𝒯𝒯(X),\nFor upwards-closed V ⊆ 𝒯𝒯(X), μ_X(V) = ⋂_{T ∈ U} T where U ∈ V,\nThe meet operation in 𝒯(X) is recoverable from μ_X,\nThe join operation in 𝒯(X) is recoverable from μ_X via μ_X applied to a union of principal filters,\nComplete atomic Boolean algebras are equivalent to Set^op via the comparison functor.\n\nBut each line should be one assumption, each applying to one object. Maybe splitting them:\n\nAssumption:\n𝒯 is the composite functor 𝒫^op ∘ 𝒫,\n𝒯 forms a monad (𝒯, η, μ),\nThe unit η_X sends x ∈ X to the principal filter of {x},\nThe multiplication μ_X is defined as ⋃_{U ∈ V} { S ⊆ X : η_{𝒫(X)}(S) = U },\nFor upwards-closed V ∈ 𝒯𝒯(X), μ_X(V) = ⋂_{T ∈ U} T for U ∈ V,\nThe meet operation in 𝒯(X) is recovered from μ_X,\nThe join operation in 𝒯(X) is recovered via μ_X applied to unions of principal filters,\nSet^op is equivalent to the category of complete atomic Boolean algebras.\n\nBut perhaps some of these are part of the problem statement rather than assumptions. Wait, the user is asking to show that 𝒯-algebras are complete atomic Boolean algebras, given the setup. So the problem's assumptions would be the structure of the monad 𝒯, the definitions of η and μ, and the properties derived about them. The problem is to use these to establish the equivalence.\n\nHence, the Assumptions should include:\n\n- The monad (𝒯, η, μ) is defined by composing 𝒫^op and 𝒫.\n- η_X(x) is the principal filter generated by {x}.\n- μ_X(V) has the given construction.\n- For upwards-closed V, μ_X(V) is the intersection over sets in U for U ∈ V.\n- The meet and join operations in 𝒯(X) can be expressed using μ_X.\n\nEach of these should be a separate assumption. But the problem is to show that the algebras for this monad are complete atomic Boolean algebras. So the problem statement is exactly that.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n𝒯 = 𝒫^op ∘ 𝒫 is a monad (𝒯, η, μ),\nη_X(x) = { S ⊆ X | x ∈ S },\nμ_X(V) = ⋃_{U ∈ V} { S ⊆ X | η_{𝒫(X)}(S) = U },\nFor upwards-closed V ∈ 𝒯𝒯(X), μ_X(V) = ⋂_{T ∈ U} T where U ∈ V,\nMeet and join operations in 𝒯(X) are recoverable from μ_X.\n\nProblem:\nShow that a 𝒯-algebra is equivalent to a complete atomic Boolean algebra.\n\nBut need to check if the assumptions are each single conditions. For example, \"𝒯 is a monad\" is one assumption. \"η_X is defined as...\" is another. Each part of the monad structure (unit and multiplication) are separate.\n\nBut the example given in the user's instruction was simpler, with two assumptions. Here, the problem is more complex. Let me try to structure each assumption line by line:\n\nAssumption:\n𝒯 is the composite of the contravariant powerset functor 𝒫 and its right adjoint 𝒫^op,\n𝒯 is a monad with unit η and multiplication μ,\nFor each set X, η_X(x) = { S ⊆ X | x ∈ S },\nFor each set X, μ_X(V) = ⋃_{U ∈ V} { S ⊆ X | η_{𝒫(X)}(S) = U },\nIf V ∈ 𝒯𝒯(X) is upwards-closed, μ_X(V) = ⋂_{T ∈ U} T for U ∈ V,\nThe meet operation of 𝒯(X) can be recovered from μ_X,\nThe join operation of 𝒯(X) can be recovered from μ_X,\nThe category Set^op is equivalent to the category of complete atomic Boolean algebras.\n\nProblem:\nShow that a 𝒯-algebra is a complete atomic Boolean algebra.\n\nBut perhaps some of these are not necessary. For instance, the equivalence of Set^op with CABool is given as a consequence, but the problem is to show that 𝒯-algebras are CABool. So maybe the key assumptions are the structure of the monad and the properties of η and μ.\n\nAlternatively, since the user is asking how to show this directly, the assumptions would be the components of the monad and their properties. So each line in Assumption is one property of the monad.\n\nSo, after breaking down, the formatted problem would have Assumptions:\n\n𝒯 is the double powerset monad formed by 𝒫^op ∘ 𝒫,\nThe unit η_X sends each element x ∈ X to its principal filter,\nThe multiplication μ_X is defined as specified for elements of 𝒯𝒯(X),\nμ_X simplifies to intersections over sets when applied to upwards-closed families,\nMeet and join operations in 𝒯(X) are recoverable via μ_X.\n\nProblem:\nDemonstrate that the category of 𝒯-algebras is equivalent to the category of complete atomic Boolean algebras.\n\nBut perhaps the exact problem statement is: Show that a 𝒯-algebra is a complete atomic Boolean algebra.\n\nYes, the user's question is: \"How does one show this directly?\" referring to the fact that 𝒯-algebras are CABool. So the problem is to prove that each 𝒯-algebra is a complete atomic Boolean algebra, using the given definitions of η and μ.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption:\n𝒯 = 𝒫^op ∘ 𝒫 is a monad on Set,\nη_X(x) = { S ⊆ X | x ∈ S },\nμ_X(V) = ⋃_{U ∈ V} { S ⊆ X | η_{𝒫(X)}(S) = U },\nFor upwards-closed V ⊆ 𝒯𝒯(X), μ_X(V) = ⋂_{T ∈ U} T where U ∈ V,\nMeet and join operations in 𝒯(X) are definable using μ_X.\n\nProblem:\nProve that a 𝒯-algebra is a complete atomic Boolean algebra.\n\nEach assumption is a separate line, each addressing one property. The problem is to show the algebras of this monad are CABool.",
