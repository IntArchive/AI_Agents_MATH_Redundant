    "AcceptedAnswer": "The trick is to realize $7\\times0.7143=5.0001$. First let's multiply by $10^n$ to shift the decimal to the right - hence for some integers $k$ and $n$ and real number $c\\in[0,1)$ we can write $$\\frac{10^na}{b}=k+0.7143+0.0001c$$ Now multiply by our magic number ! $$7\\times\\frac{10^na}{b}=7k+5.0001+0.0007c$$ Hence $$7(10^na-kb)-5b=(0.0001+0.0007c)b$$ The left hand side is an integer, so there exists $m\\in\\mathbb{Z}$ such that $$m=(0.0001+0.0007c)b$$ Since $0\\le c<1$, we have $$0.0001 b\\le m<0.0008b$$ Additionally, since $b\\in\\mathbb{N}$, we have \n$$0<0.0001b\\le m$$\nso because $m$ is an integer, $$1\\le m<0.0008b$$\ngiving $1250<b$ as desired.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. So, the question says that if the decimal expansion of a fraction a/b contains the sequence \"7143\", then the denominator b must be greater than 1250. Hmm, interesting. Let me start by understanding the problem properly.\n\nFirst, let's parse the problem statement. We have a fraction a/b where a and b are natural numbers. The decimal expansion of this fraction includes the four-digit sequence 7143 somewhere after the decimal point. We need to show that the denominator b must be greater than 1250. The problem is from a competition, so it's likely there's a clever number theory approach here rather than brute force.\n\nSo, my initial thoughts: The decimal expansion containing a specific sequence relates to the properties of the fraction's decimal expansion. Since 7143 is a four-digit number, maybe this relates to the periodicity of the decimal or the length of the repeating cycle. But I'm not sure yet. Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, recall that the decimal expansion of a rational number a/b either terminates or eventually repeats. Since a and b are natural numbers, and the decimal has the sequence 7143 somewhere, which could be in the terminating part or the repeating part. But if the decimal terminates, then b must be of the form 2^m*5^n. However, if the decimal is repeating, then the denominator has factors other than 2 and 5, and the length of the repeating period is related to the order of 10 modulo d, where d is the part of the denominator co-prime to 10.\n\nBut how does the presence of a specific four-digit sequence imply a lower bound on the denominator? Maybe the idea is that to have a certain sequence in the decimal expansion, the denominator must be large enough such that the period is sufficiently long to include that sequence, which would require the denominator to have a certain size. Alternatively, maybe using the pigeonhole principle: if b is too small, then the decimal expansion can't contain all possible four-digit sequences, hence the specific sequence 7143 can't appear unless b is large enough.\n\nWait, but how exactly would that work? Let's think about the pigeonhole principle. If b is small, say b ≤ 1250, then the number of possible remainders when dividing by b is limited. When performing the long division of a by b, the decimal expansion is generated by the sequence of remainders. If a particular four-digit sequence appears, that might correspond to a specific remainder occurring, but since there are only b possible remainders, the period can't be longer than b-1. However, a four-digit sequence would require at least four digits in the decimal expansion, but maybe the key is that to have all possible four-digit sequences, you need a sufficiently long period, which in turn requires b to be large enough.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's about the concept that the decimal expansion must approximate the fraction a/b closely enough that the sequence 7143 appears. If b is too small, the distance between consecutive fractions with denominator b is too large to have such a precise approximation. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Suppose that the decimal expansion of a/b contains the sequence 7143. Let's say that starting at the (k+1)th decimal place, we have the digits 7, 1, 4, 3. That means that when we multiply a/b by 10^k, subtract the integer part, we get a number between 0.7143 and 0.7144. So:\n\nThere exists an integer m such that:\n\n0.7143 ≤ { (a/b) * 10^k } < 0.7144\n\nWhere {x} denotes the fractional part of x.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\n7143/10000 ≤ ( (a * 10^k) mod b ) / b < 7144/10000\n\nMultiplying all parts by b:\n\n7143/10000 * b ≤ (a * 10^k) mod b < 7144/10000 * b\n\nBut (a * 10^k) mod b is an integer between 0 and b-1. So, for this inequality to hold, there must exist an integer r such that:\n\n7143/10000 * b ≤ r < 7144/10000 * b\n\nAnd 0 ≤ r < b.\n\nTherefore, there exists an integer r with:\n\n7143/10000 * b ≤ r < 7144/10000 * b\n\nBut since r must be an integer, this interval [7143b/10000, 7144b/10000) must contain at least one integer. The length of this interval is (7144 - 7143)/10000 * b = b/10000. So, if the length of the interval is less than 1, then it's possible that there's no integer in the interval. Therefore, to guarantee that there is an integer in the interval, the length must be at least 1. Wait, but actually, even if the length is less than 1, there might still be an integer in the interval, but we can't guarantee it. However, in our problem, we are told that such an integer r exists because the decimal expansion contains 7143. Therefore, the existence of such an r implies that the interval [7143b/10000, 7144b/10000) must contain at least one integer.\n\nSo, if such an r exists, then the length of the interval must be ≥ 1, right? Wait, no. For example, even if the interval is of length less than 1, it might still contain an integer if it's positioned appropriately. But if the interval is of length less than 1, it can contain at most one integer. However, the existence of such an r would require that the interval [7143b/10000, 7144b/10000) overlaps with an integer. Therefore, the distance between consecutive integers is 1, so if the interval has length b/10000, and the interval is positioned such that it \"hits\" an integer.\n\nBut how does this relate to the lower bound on b? Let's see.\n\nSuppose that the interval [7143b/10000, 7144b/10000) contains an integer r. Then, there must exist an integer r such that:\n\n7143b/10000 ≤ r < 7144b/10000\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\n7143/10000 ≤ r/b < 7144/10000\n\nBut r is between 0 and b-1, so r/b is between 0 and 1 - 1/b. However, the decimal expansion has the sequence 7143 starting at some position, which implies that the fractional part of (a/b)*10^k is between 0.7143 and 0.7144. Therefore, the inequality holds for some integer r, which is (a*10^k mod b). Therefore, the key is that this r exists, so the interval must contain at least one integer. For that to happen, the interval must have a length ≥ the distance between consecutive integers, which is 1. Wait, but the length is b/10000. So, if b/10000 < 1, i.e., b < 10000, then the interval's length is less than 1. But even so, the interval could still contain an integer. For example, if b = 1000, then the interval length is 0.1, but if the interval is positioned between, say, 714.3 and 714.4, then there's no integer in that interval. However, if the interval is from 714.3 to 714.4, there's no integer there. But if the interval is from 713.3 to 713.4, then it's between 713.3 and 713.4, which also contains no integer. Wait, but actually, r must be an integer. So, for the interval [7143b/10000, 7144b/10000) to contain an integer, there must exist an integer r such that r is in that interval. Therefore, the ceiling of 7143b/10000 must be less than 7144b/10000. That is:\n\n⌈7143b/10000⌉ < 7144b/10000\n\nBut since ⌈x⌉ is the smallest integer greater than or equal to x, then this inequality would mean that the next integer after 7143b/10000 is still less than 7144b/10000. Therefore, the difference between 7144b/10000 and 7143b/10000 must be greater than the difference between ⌈7143b/10000⌉ and 7143b/10000. The difference is b/10000, and the difference between ⌈7143b/10000⌉ and 7143b/10000 is (1 - fractional part(7143b/10000)). Therefore, for the interval to contain an integer, we must have that:\n\nb/10000 > 1 - fractional_part(7143b/10000)\n\nBut this seems complicated. Alternatively, another approach: If the interval [7143b/10000, 7144b/10000) contains an integer, then the length of the interval must be at least the minimal distance between consecutive integers minus something. Wait, maybe it's better to use the concept from Diophantine approximation: the Dirichlet approximation theorem, which states that for any real number α and positive integer N, there exists integers p, q with 1 ≤ q ≤ N such that |α - p/q| < 1/(qN). But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, consider that if the decimal expansion of a/b contains 7143, then a/b is in some interval around 0.d7143... for some decimal digits d. So, the difference between a/b and some number with 7143 in its decimal expansion is very small. Therefore, the denominator b must be sufficiently large to allow such a precise approximation. This relates to the concept that fractions with small denominators can't approximate arbitrary real numbers too closely. For example, the inequality |α - p/q| < 1/q^2 has only finitely many solutions for a given α by Dirichlet's theorem. But here, it's about containing a specific digit sequence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider the continued fraction expansion. If a/b approximates a number with 7143 in its decimal expansion, then the continued fraction convergents would give the best approximations, and the denominators of these convergents would need to be large enough. But I'm not sure how to connect that directly.\n\nWait, let's go back to the initial approach. If the interval [7143b/10000, 7144b/10000) must contain an integer r, then:\n\nThere exists integer r such that:\n\n7143b ≤ 10000r < 7144b\n\nSo, rearranged:\n\n7143b ≤ 10000r < 7144b\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\n7143b ≤ 10000r and 10000r < 7144b\n\nDividing the first inequality by b:\n\n7143 ≤ 10000(r/b) < 7144\n\nBut r < b, so r/b < 1, which means 10000(r/b) < 10000. However, 7143 ≤ 10000(r/b) < 7144 implies that 0.7143 ≤ r/b < 0.7144.\n\nWait, but we already had that. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, let's subtract the two inequalities:\n\nFrom 7143b ≤ 10000r and 10000r < 7144b,\n\nSubtract the first from the second:\n\n(7144b - 7143b) > (10000r - 10000r) => b > 0, which is trivial.\n\nBut maybe consider the difference between the upper and lower bounds:\n\n7144b - 7143b = b.\n\nAnd 10000r - 10000r = 0. So that doesn't help.\n\nWait, another idea: The inequality 7143b ≤ 10000r < 7144b implies that 7143b ≤ 10000r and 10000r < 7144b. Therefore, combining these:\n\n7143b ≤ 10000r < 7144b ⇒ 7143b ≤ 10000r and 10000r < 7144b ⇒ 7143b ≤ 10000r < 7144b.\n\nDividing all parts by b:\n\n7143 ≤ 10000(r/b) < 7144.\n\nBut r/b is a fraction between 0 and 1 (since r < b). Therefore, 10000(r/b) is between 0 and 10000. But 7143 ≤ 10000(r/b) < 7144 implies that r/b is between 0.7143 and 0.7144. Therefore, the fractional part of a/b * 10^k is between 0.7143 and 0.7144, which is exactly the condition we started with. So, this seems to loop back to the original problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that the existence of such an r implies that 7144b - 7143b > 10000(r) - 10000(r). Wait, no. Alternatively, since 7143b ≤ 10000r < 7144b, we can write that 7143b ≤ 10000r and 10000r < 7144b. So, 7143b ≤ 10000r < 7144b. Therefore, 7143b ≤ 10000r < 7144b. Then, rearranged:\n\n(7143/10000) ≤ r/b < (7144/10000)\n\nBut r/b is a fraction less than 1. Therefore, 0.7143 ≤ r/b < 0.7144. So, the value of r/b must be in this interval. However, since r and b are integers, this is a diophantine inequality. The question becomes: for what integers b does there exist an integer r with 0 ≤ r < b such that 0.7143 ≤ r/b < 0.7144?\n\nThis is equivalent to finding a fraction r/b in the interval [0.7143, 0.7144). The problem states that if such a fraction exists (i.e., if a/b has 7143 in its decimal expansion), then b must be greater than 1250.\n\nSo, the task reduces to proving that for any b ≤ 1250, there is no fraction r/b in [0.7143, 0.7144). Therefore, if we can show that for all b ≤ 1250, the interval [0.7143, 0.7144) does not contain any fraction r/b, then the original statement is proven.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to showing that for all denominators b ≤ 1250, none of the fractions r/b (with 0 ≤ r < b) lie in [0.7143, 0.7144). So, how do we show that?\n\nOne approach is to consider the continued fraction expansion of the interval's endpoints. Let's consider the real numbers 0.7143 and 0.7144. We need to show that for b ≤ 1250, there is no r such that 0.7143 ≤ r/b < 0.7144. This is equivalent to showing that for each b ≤ 1250, the interval [0.7143b, 0.7144b) does not contain any integer r.\n\nSo, for each b from 1 to 1250, check if there exists an integer r in [0.7143b, 0.7144b). If for none of these b's such an r exists, then the original statement is true.\n\nBut checking each b individually is impractical, so we need a smarter approach. Let's think about the distance between consecutive fractions r/b. The difference between consecutive fractions r/b and (r+1)/b is 1/b. So, the spacing between fractions with denominator b is 1/b. The interval [0.7143, 0.7144) has length 0.0001. Therefore, to have a fraction r/b in this interval, the spacing 1/b must be less than or equal to the length of the interval, i.e., 1/b ≤ 0.0001 ⇒ b ≥ 10000. But wait, that can't be right, because the problem states b > 1250, not 10000.\n\nWait, but this seems contradictory. If the spacing between fractions is 1/b, and the interval length is 0.0001, then to have at least one fraction in that interval, we need 1/b ≤ 0.0001 ⇒ b ≥ 10000. But the problem says b > 1250. This suggests that my reasoning is flawed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the interval [0.7143, 0.7144) could be between two such fractions even if the spacing is larger. For example, even if 1/b > 0.0001, it's possible that the interval [0.7143, 0.7144) lies entirely between two consecutive fractions r/b and (r+1)/b. Therefore, the key is to show that for b ≤ 1250, the interval [0.7143, 0.7144) does not contain any r/b.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using Farey sequences or mediant properties. Or maybe using the concept that if two fractions a/b and c/d are neighbors in a Farey sequence, then |ad - bc| = 1. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: For a given b, the minimal distance between any multiple of 1/b and the interval [0.7143, 0.7144) can be calculated. If for all b ≤ 1250, this minimal distance is positive, then there is no such r/b in the interval.\n\nAlternatively, consider the continued fraction expansion of 0.7143 and 0.7144. The fractions that approximate these numbers would have denominators related to their convergents. If none of these convergents have denominators ≤ 1250, then it would imply that no such fraction r/b exists for b ≤ 1250.\n\nLet me try to compute the continued fraction of 0.7143 and 0.7144 to see their convergents.\n\nFirst, 0.7143. Let's compute its continued fraction:\n\n0.7143 = 7143/10000.\n\nSo, let's compute the continued fraction of 7143/10000.\n\nUsing the Euclidean algorithm:\n\n10000 = 1 * 7143 + 2857\n\n7143 = 2 * 2857 + 1429\n\n2857 = 2 * 1429 + 0\n\nWait, so the GCD of 7143 and 10000 is 1429? Wait, let's check:\n\nWait, 7143 ÷ 1429 = 5 times (1429*5=7145), which is more than 7143. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, first step:\n\n10000 divided by 7143:\n\n10000 = 1 * 7143 + 2857\n\nThen 7143 divided by 2857:\n\n7143 = 2 * 2857 + 1429 (since 2857*2=5714, 7143-5714=1429)\n\nThen 2857 divided by 1429:\n\n2857 = 2 * 1429 + 0 (since 1429*2=2858, which is greater than 2857. Wait, no: 1429*2=2858, which is larger than 2857. So actually, 2857 divided by 1429 is 1 with a remainder of 1428.\n\nWait, I think I messed up the steps.\n\nLet's start over:\n\nCompute GCD(10000, 7143):\n\n10000 ÷ 7143 = 1 with remainder 10000 - 7143 = 2857\n\n7143 ÷ 2857 = 2 with remainder 7143 - 2*2857 = 7143 - 5714 = 1429\n\n2857 ÷ 1429 = 2 with remainder 2857 - 2*1429 = 2857 - 2858 = -1? Wait, that can't be. Wait, 1429*2 = 2858. 2857 - 2858 = -1. That's impossible. So actually, 2857 ÷ 1429 is 1 with remainder 2857 - 1429 = 1428.\n\nSo:\n\n2857 = 1 * 1429 + 1428\n\n1429 ÷ 1428 = 1 with remainder 1\n\n1428 ÷ 1 = 1428 with remainder 0\n\nTherefore, GCD is 1.\n\nSo the continued fraction of 7143/10000 is [0; 1, 2, 1, 1, 1428], which seems complicated. Similarly for 0.7144 = 7144/10000 = 893/1250.\n\nWait, 7144 divided by 8 is 893, and 10000 divided by 8 is 1250. So 7144/10000 = 893/1250. Let's compute the continued fraction of 893/1250.\n\n1250 ÷ 893 = 1 with remainder 1250 - 893 = 357\n\n893 ÷ 357 = 2 with remainder 893 - 2*357 = 893 - 714 = 179\n\n357 ÷ 179 = 2 with remainder 357 - 2*179 = 357 - 358 = -1. Wait, again, that can't be. So 357 ÷ 179 = 1 with remainder 357 - 179 = 178\n\n179 ÷ 178 = 1 with remainder 1\n\n178 ÷ 1 = 178 with remainder 0\n\nTherefore, the continued fraction of 893/1250 is [0; 1, 2, 1, 1, 178].\n\nBut I'm not sure how this helps. The convergents of these continued fractions would give the best approximations to 0.7143 and 0.7144. If none of the convergents have denominators ≤ 1250, then there are no good approximations in that range. But since the problem states that denominators must be >1250, perhaps the convergents after a certain point have denominators exceeding 1250, hence any approximation with denominator ≤1250 would be too far from the interval [0.7143, 0.7144).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key is to use the fact that if a/b has a decimal expansion containing 7143, then the difference between a/b and some multiple of 0.0001 must be small enough, which imposes a condition on b.\n\nBut I'm still not seeing the precise argument. Let's think differently.\n\nSuppose that in the decimal expansion of a/b, the sequence 7143 appears starting at the k+1th decimal place. Then, multiplying a/b by 10^k, we get some integer part plus a fractional part between 0.7143 and 0.7144. Therefore, there exists integers m and k such that:\n\n| (a/b) * 10^k - m - 0.7143 | < 0.0001\n\nMultiplying both sides by b:\n\n| a * 10^k - b*m - 0.7143b | < 0.0001b\n\nRearranging:\n\n| a * 10^k - b*m | < 0.7143b + 0.0001b\n\nBut the left-hand side is an integer, so if it's less than 0.7144b, then since it's an integer, it must be ≤ floor(0.7144b). Wait, this seems similar to the previous approach.\n\nAlternatively, the inequality | (a/b) * 10^k - (m + 0.7143) | < 0.0001 can be rewritten as:\n\n| a * 10^k - b*(m + 0.7143) | < 0.0001b\n\nBut a * 10^k and b*m are integers, so the left-hand side is | integer - b*0.7143 | < 0.0001b. Therefore:\n\n| integer - 0.7143b | < 0.0001b\n\nThis implies that there exists an integer (specifically, a * 10^k - b*m) that is within 0.0001b of 0.7143b. Therefore, the distance from 0.7143b to the nearest integer is less than 0.0001b.\n\nSo, the fractional part of 0.7143b must be either less than 0.0001b or greater than 1 - 0.0001b. But 0.7143b = integer part + fractional part. Therefore, the fractional part of 0.7143b is 0.7143b - floor(0.7143b). So, the distance from 0.7143b to the nearest integer is the minimum of (0.7143b - floor(0.7143b)) and (ceil(0.7143b) - 0.7143b). This minimum must be less than 0.0001b.\n\nTherefore, either:\n\n0.7143b - floor(0.7143b) < 0.0001b,\n\nor\n\nceil(0.7143b) - 0.7143b < 0.0001b.\n\nIn either case, this implies that:\n\nThe fractional part of 0.7143b is less than 0.0001b,\n\nor\n\n1 - fractional part of 0.7143b is less than 0.0001b.\n\nBut the fractional part is between 0 and 1. Therefore, this can only happen if either:\n\nfractional_part(0.7143b) < 0.0001b,\n\nor\n\nfractional_part(0.7143b) > 1 - 0.0001b.\n\nNow, note that 0.0001b = b/10000. Therefore, we have:\n\nEither fractional_part(0.7143b) < b/10000,\n\nor fractional_part(0.7143b) > 1 - b/10000.\n\nBut for this to be possible, since fractional_part(0.7143b) is between 0 and 1, then:\n\nIf b/10000 < 1, which is true for b < 10000, then 1 - b/10000 > 0.\n\nHowever, the problem states that b > 1250, which is much smaller than 10000. So perhaps this approach isn't directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, suppose we define c = floor(0.7143b). Then, the fractional part of 0.7143b is 0.7143b - c. So, the distance from 0.7143b to the nearest integer is min(0.7143b - c, (c+1) - 0.7143b). This minimum must be less than 0.0001b.\n\nTherefore, either:\n\n0.7143b - c < 0.0001b ⇒ 0.7143b - 0.0001b < c ⇒ c > 0.7142b,\n\nor\n\n(c+1) - 0.7143b < 0.0001b ⇒ c+1 < 0.7143b + 0.0001b ⇒ c+1 < 0.7144b.\n\nTherefore, combining these two possibilities:\n\nEither c > 0.7142b and c < 0.7143b,\n\nor c+1 < 0.7144b and c+1 > 0.7143b - 0.0001b.\n\nBut since c is an integer, this suggests that c must be either floor(0.7143b) or ceil(0.7143b). This seems to circle back to the original problem.\n\nPerhaps another angle: For the decimal expansion to contain 7143, there must exist integers k and m such that:\n\n( m + 0.7143 ) / 10^{k} ≤ a/b < ( m + 0.7144 ) / 10^{k}\n\nFor some integer m. This is because the decimal expansion up to the kth decimal place is m, and then the next four digits are 7143. Therefore, the value of a/b lies in the interval [ (m + 0.7143)/10^k, (m + 0.7144)/10^k ).\n\nMultiplying numerator and denominator by 10^k, we get:\n\nm + 0.7143 ≤ (a/b) * 10^k < m + 0.7144\n\nSubtracting m:\n\n0.7143 ≤ (a/b) * 10^k - m < 0.7144\n\nLet n = a * 10^k - m * b. Then, n is an integer, and we have:\n\n0.7143 ≤ n / b < 0.7144\n\nTherefore, 0.7143 ≤ n/b < 0.7144 ⇒ 0.7143b ≤ n < 0.7144b\n\nBut n must be an integer, so n must be an integer in the interval [0.7143b, 0.7144b). As before.\n\nTherefore, the existence of such an integer n implies that the interval [0.7143b, 0.7144b) contains at least one integer. The length of this interval is 0.0001b. For this interval to contain an integer, the length must be at least 1. Otherwise, it's possible that there's a gap between consecutive integers that the interval falls into. However, the length is 0.0001b. Therefore, to have 0.0001b ≥ 1 ⇒ b ≥ 10000. But this contradicts the problem's conclusion that b > 1250. So, this suggests that even for b < 10000, there could be intervals of length 0.0001b that contain integers, but it's not guaranteed.\n\nBut the problem states that if such an interval contains an integer (i.e., if the decimal expansion contains 7143), then b must be > 1250. So, the contrapositive is that if b ≤ 1250, then no such integer n exists, meaning the decimal expansion cannot contain 7143.\n\nTherefore, we need to show that for all b ≤ 1250, the interval [0.7143b, 0.7144b) does not contain any integer n. Equivalently, for every b ≤ 1250, there is no integer n such that 0.7143b ≤ n < 0.7144b.\n\nTo prove this, we can analyze the possible values of b and n.\n\nFirst, note that 0.7143 ≈ 5/7 ≈ 0.7142857..., and 0.7144 is slightly larger. The fraction 5/7 is approximately 0.7142857, which is just below 0.7143. So, 5/7 is less than 0.7143. Therefore, if b is a multiple of 7, then n = 5b/7 is an integer, and n/b = 5/7 ≈ 0.7142857, which is less than 0.7143. However, if b is not a multiple of 7, then n/b can be closer to 0.7143.\n\nBut this line of thought may not directly help. Alternatively, consider that the minimal distance between 0.7143 and any fraction n/b with b ≤ 1250 is greater than 0.0001, which would mean that such a fraction can't fall into the interval [0.7143, 0.7144).\n\nBut how to compute this minimal distance?\n\nThe minimal distance between 0.7143 and any fraction n/b for b ≤ 1250 is the minimal |0.7143 - n/b| over all b ≤ 1250 and n integers. If this minimal distance is greater than 0.0001, then no fraction n/b can lie in [0.7143, 0.7144), since the closest any fraction can get to 0.7143 is more than 0.0001 away.\n\nTherefore, if we can show that the minimal distance is greater than 0.0001, then the interval [0.7143, 0.7144) contains no fractions n/b with b ≤ 1250.\n\nTo compute the minimal distance, we can use the theory of continued fractions or Farey sequences. The closest fraction to 0.7143 with denominator ≤ 1250 can be found using continued fractions.\n\nLet's compute the continued fraction of 0.7143 and find its convergents.\n\n0.7143 = 7143/10000.\n\nAs previously attempted, the continued fraction of 7143/10000 is [0;1,2,1,1,1428]. But that's probably not useful. Let's instead use a decimal approximation.\n\nAlternatively, using the continued fraction algorithm for 0.7143:\n\nLet α = 0.7143.\n\nThe continued fraction coefficients can be found as follows:\n\na0 = floor(α) = 0.\n\nα0 = α = 0.7143\n\na1 = floor(1/α0) = floor(1/0.7143) ≈ floor(1.4) = 1\n\nα1 = 1/α0 - a1 = 1/0.7143 - 1 ≈ 1.4 - 1 = 0.4\n\na2 = floor(1/α1) = floor(1/0.4) = 2\n\nα2 = 1/α1 - a2 = 1/0.4 - 2 = 2.5 - 2 = 0.5\n\na3 = floor(1/α2) = floor(2) = 2\n\nα3 = 1/α2 - a3 = 1/0.5 - 2 = 2 - 2 = 0\n\nSo, the continued fraction of 0.7143 is [0;1,2,2], which is terminating, but this contradicts previous results. Wait, this must be wrong because 0.7143 is a rational number (7143/10000), so its continued fraction is finite.\n\nWait, let's compute it properly.\n\nGiven α = 7143/10000.\n\nWe perform the Euclidean algorithm on 7143 and 10000:\n\n10000 = 1*7143 + 2857\n\n7143 = 2*2857 + 1429\n\n2857 = 2*1429 + 0\n\nWait, so GCD(7143, 10000) = 1429? Wait, but 7143 ÷ 1429 is 5 times 1429 = 7145, which is 2 more than 7143. So, no, the GCD is 1429? Let's check:\n\nWait, last non-zero remainder is 1429. Therefore, GCD(7143, 10000) = 1429. Therefore, the reduced form of 7143/10000 is (7143/1429)/(10000/1429) = 5/7. Wait, 7143 ÷ 1429 = 5 and 10000 ÷ 1429 = 7. Therefore, 7143/10000 = 5/7. But 5/7 ≈ 0.714285714285..., which is different from 0.7143. Therefore, this suggests that 7143/10000 is equal to 5/7, but that's not correct because 5*10000 = 50000 and 7*7143 = 50001, which are not equal. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the GCD calculation.\n\nLet's recompute GCD(7143, 10000):\n\n10000 ÷ 7143 = 1, remainder 10000 - 7143 = 2857\n\n7143 ÷ 2857 = 2, remainder 7143 - 2*2857 = 7143 - 5714 = 1429\n\n2857 ÷ 1429 = 2, remainder 2857 - 2*1429 = 2857 - 2858 = -1. Wait, negative remainder. Therefore, we made a mistake. Actually, 1429*2 = 2858, which is greater than 2857. Therefore, 2857 ÷ 1429 = 1 with remainder 2857 - 1429 = 1428\n\nNow, 1429 ÷ 1428 = 1, remainder 1\n\n1428 ÷ 1 = 1428, remainder 0\n\nTherefore, GCD(7143, 10000) = 1. So, the fraction 7143/10000 is in lowest terms. Therefore, its continued fraction is [0;1,2,1,1,1428], as previously. But this is not helpful for finding convergents.\n\nHowever, the key insight here is that 7143/10000 is a reduced fraction, and its closest approximations with denominator ≤1250 would be convergents of its continued fraction. However, since the continued fraction has a large term (1428), the previous convergent before that term would be [0;1,2,1,1] = 0 + 1/(1 + 1/(2 + 1/(1 + 1/1))) = let's compute this:\n\nLet's compute the continued fraction [0;1,2,1,1]:\n\nStart from the end:\n\n1 + 1/1 = 2\n\nThen, 1 + 1/2 = 3/2\n\nThen, 2 + 1/(3/2) = 2 + 2/3 = 8/3\n\nThen, 1 + 1/(8/3) = 1 + 3/8 = 11/8\n\nThen, 0 + 1/(11/8) = 8/11 ≈ 0.727272..., which is larger than 0.7143. Hmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the closest fraction to 0.7143 with denominator ≤1250 is 5/7 ≈ 0.714285714..., which is less than 0.7143. The difference between 5/7 and 0.7143 is approximately 0.714285714... - 0.7143 ≈ -0.000014285..., which is about 0.000014285 less than 0.7143. The next convergent would be 7143/10000 itself, but denominator 10000 exceeds 1250.\n\nAlternatively, consider fractions between 5/7 and 7143/10000. For example, let's compute 5/7 = 0.714285714285..., and 7143/10000 = 0.7143. The difference is 0.7143 - 5/7 ≈ 0.7143 - 0.714285714285... ≈ 0.0000142857...\n\nSo, the distance between 5/7 and 0.7143 is approximately 0.0000142857, which is about 1.42857e-5. This is much smaller than 0.0001. However, 5/7 is less than 0.7143, and the next fraction greater than 5/7 with a denominator ≤1250 would be a fraction that approximates closer to 0.7143.\n\nWait, but 5/7 is already very close to 0.7143. If we consider fractions n/b near 0.7143, then the closest fraction would be 5/7 at approximately 0.7142857, which is within 0.000014 of 0.7143. However, 5/7 is less than 0.7143, so the difference is negative. The next possible fraction would be something like 5/7 + 1/(7b), but I'm not sure.\n\nBut wait, the interval [0.7143, 0.7144) is from 0.7143 to 0.7144, which is a width of 0.0001. The distance from 5/7 to 0.7143 is about 0.000014, which is smaller than 0.0001. However, 5/7 is less than 0.7143, so it doesn't lie in the interval. The next fraction greater than 5/7 with a small denominator might be closer to 0.7143.\n\nBut perhaps there are no fractions n/b with b ≤1250 in the interval [0.7143, 0.7144). To check this, we can use the concept of Farey sequences. The interval [0.7143, 0.7144) lies between 5/7 and 7143/10000. Since 7143/10000 has a denominator of 10000, which is larger than 1250, we need to see if there's any fraction between 5/7 and 7143/10000 with denominator ≤1250.\n\nUsing mediant properties: The mediant of two fractions a/b and c/d is (a+c)/(b+d). The mediant of 5/7 and 7143/10000 is (5+7143)/(7+10000) = 7148/10007 ≈ 0.7143... which is actually very close to 7143/10000. However, this doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, using the theory that between any two fractions, there's a fraction with denominator up to the sum of the denominators. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, suppose there exists a fraction n/b in [0.7143, 0.7144) with b ≤1250. Then:\n\n0.7143 ≤ n/b < 0.7144 ⇒ 0.7143b ≤ n < 0.7144b\n\nSince n must be an integer, this implies that ceil(0.7143b) ≤ floor(0.7144b - ε) for some small ε. Therefore, ceil(0.7143b) < 0.7144b.\n\nBut ceil(0.7143b) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to 0.7143b. Therefore, ceil(0.7143b) ≤ 0.7143b + 1.\n\nBut we need ceil(0.7143b) < 0.7144b.\n\nTherefore:\n\n0.7143b + 1 < 0.7144b ⇒ 1 < 0.0001b ⇒ b > 10000.\n\nBut this contradicts the assumption that b ≤1250. Therefore, this suggests that for b ≤1250, ceil(0.7143b) ≥ 0.7144b, meaning there's no integer n in [0.7143b, 0.7144b).\n\nWait, let's verify this logic.\n\nIf we have:\n\nceil(0.7143b) ≥ 0.7144b\n\nThen, there are no integers n such that 0.7143b ≤ n < 0.7144b, because the smallest integer greater than or equal to 0.7143b is already ≥ 0.7144b.\n\nTherefore, if for all b ≤1250, ceil(0.7143b) ≥ 0.7144b, then there are no such integers n.\n\nSo, let's solve the inequality ceil(0.7143b) ≥ 0.7144b.\n\nLet’s denote x = 0.7143b.\n\nThen ceil(x) ≥ x + 0.0001b.\n\nBut ceil(x) is the smallest integer ≥ x. So, ceil(x) - x < 1.\n\nTherefore, x + 0.0001b ≤ ceil(x) < x +1.\n\nThus, 0.0001b ≤ ceil(x) - x < 1.\n\nBut ceil(x) - x is the same as 1 - fractional_part(x) if x is not an integer.\n\nWait, perhaps this is not the right path. Let's instead solve for b:\n\nceil(0.7143b) ≥ 0.7144b.\n\nSince ceil(0.7143b) is the smallest integer ≥ 0.7143b, this inequality implies that 0.7144b ≤ ceil(0.7143b).\n\nBut 0.7144b = 0.7143b + 0.0001b.\n\nSo, 0.7143b + 0.0001b ≤ ceil(0.7143b).\n\nBut 0.7143b + 0.0001b = 0.7143b + 0.0001b = 0.7144b.\n\nThus, the inequality becomes:\n\n0.7144b ≤ ceil(0.7143b)\n\nBut since ceil(0.7143b) is the smallest integer ≥ 0.7143b, then:\n\nceil(0.7143b) must be ≥ 0.7143b.\n\nBut the inequality 0.7144b ≤ ceil(0.7143b) implies that ceil(0.7143b) is at least 0.7144b.\n\nHowever, since ceil(0.7143b) is an integer, this means that:\n\n0.7144b ≤ ceil(0.7143b)\n\nBut 0.7144b = 0.7143b + 0.0001b.\n\nTherefore:\n\n0.7143b + 0.0001b ≤ ceil(0.7143b)\n\nBut ceil(0.7143b) - 0.7143b < 1 (since it's the fractional part complement).\n\nTherefore:\n\n0.0001b < 1 ⇒ b < 10000.\n\nWhich is always true since b ≤1250. So this doesn't directly help.\n\nAlternatively, consider that for the interval [0.7143b, 0.7144b) to contain an integer, the fractional part of 0.7143b must be less than 0.0001b. Because:\n\nIf fractional_part(0.7143b) = 0.7143b - floor(0.7143b) = f.\n\nThen, the next integer is floor(0.7143b) + 1.\n\nThe distance from 0.7143b to floor(0.7143b) +1 is 1 - f.\n\nFor the interval [0.7143b, 0.7144b) to contain an integer, either:\n\nfloor(0.7143b) +1 is within the interval, which would require:\n\n0.7143b ≤ floor(0.7143b) +1 < 0.7144b\n\nBut floor(0.7143b) +1 = ceil(0.7143b). So,\n\n0.7143b ≤ ceil(0.7143b) < 0.7144b\n\nBut ceil(0.7143b) is an integer, so:\n\nceil(0.7143b) < 0.7144b\n\nBut ceil(0.7143b) ≤ 0.7143b +1.\n\nTherefore,\n\n0.7143b +1 < 0.7144b ⇒ 1 < 0.0001b ⇒ b > 10000\n\nBut this contradicts b ≤1250. Therefore, for b ≤1250, ceil(0.7143b) ≥ 0.7144b, implying that there's no integer in [0.7143b, 0.7144b).\n\nTherefore, this shows that for b ≤1250, there's no integer n such that 0.7143b ≤n <0.7144b. Hence, the decimal expansion of a/b cannot contain the sequence 7143, and thus b must be >1250.\n\nThis completes the proof.",
