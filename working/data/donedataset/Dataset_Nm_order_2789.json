    "Content": "Most of us are aware of the famous \"Basel Problem\": $$\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2} = \\frac{\\pi^2}{6}$$ I remember reading an elegant proof for this using complex numbers to help find the value of the sum.  I tried finding it again to no avail.  Does anyone know a complex number proof for the solution of the Basel Problem?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The most straightforward way I know is to consider the contour integral\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\\oint\\pi\\cot(\\pi z)\\frac{1}{z^2}\\mathrm{d}z\\tag{1}\n$$\naround circles whose radii are $\\frac12$ off an integer. The function $\\pi\\cot(\\pi z)$ has residue $1$ at every integer.  Thus the integral in $(1)$ equals the residue of $\\pi\\cot(\\pi z)\\dfrac{1}{z^2}$ at $z=0$ plus twice the sum in question (one for the positive integers and one for the negative integers). The integral in $(1)$ tends to $\\color{blue}{0}$ as the radius goes to $\\infty$. The Laurent expansion of $\\pi\\cot(\\pi z)\\dfrac{1}{z^2}$ at $z=0$ is\n$$\n\\frac{1}{z^3}-\\frac{\\pi^2}{3z}-\\frac{\\pi^4z}{45}-\\frac{2\\pi^6z^3}{945}-\\dots\\tag{2}\n$$\nThe only term that contributes to the residue at $z=0$ is the $\\dfrac1z$ term. That is, the residue at $z=0$ of $(2)$ is $\\color{green}{-\\frac{\\pi^2}{3}}$. Thus, the sum in question must be $\\color{red}{\\frac{\\pi^2}{6}}$ (so that $\\color{green}{-\\frac{\\pi^2}{3}}+2\\cdot\\color{red}{\\frac{\\pi^2}{6}}=\\color{blue}{0}$).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object. The problem statement is then written concisely.\n\nLooking at the example, the original problem mentioned that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem split the assumptions into two lines: one stating n is an integer and another that n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem didn't specify that n is divisible by 7; it said \"for every integer n.\" Hmm, maybe the example had a typo or perhaps a different version of the problem? But regardless, the key takeaway is that assumptions should be extracted from the problem's given conditions.\n\nNow, looking at the current problem from Math Stack Exchange. The title is about a complex analysis solution to the Basel Problem, which is the sum of 1/k² from k=1 to infinity equaling π²/6. The question is asking for a complex number proof of this result.\n\nSo, I need to structure this into the Assumption and Problem sections. The original problem doesn't state any explicit assumptions beyond what's in the Basel Problem itself. The Basel Problem's standard statement is that the sum converges to π²/6. The user is specifically looking for a proof using complex numbers, so maybe the assumption is that complex analysis methods are applicable here. But wait, in the example, assumptions were about the objects in the problem (like n being an integer). Here, the problem is to prove the sum equals π²/6 using complex analysis. So perhaps the assumptions would be related to the convergence of the series, or maybe properties of complex functions used in the proof.\n\nWait, but the problem as stated is to find a complex number proof. The original Basel Problem doesn't have any assumptions; it's just evaluating the sum. However, the method of proof using complex analysis might rely on certain conditions. For example, considering the Fourier series, residues, or properties of analytic functions. But since the user is asking for the proof method, not stating any conditions on the problem itself, maybe there are no specific assumptions beyond the series definition.\n\nIn the example, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n,\" the formatted assumption included \"n is divisible by 7,\" which might be a mistake. Wait, that example seems conflicting. Let me check again. The original problem says \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7.\" That might be incorrect. Perhaps the example had a different problem in mind? Because if the original problem is to prove for every integer n, then the assumption shouldn't restrict n to being divisible by 7. That might be an error in the example. Therefore, maybe the user intended that the example is correct, but in reality, the original problem might have had additional conditions. However, in the current problem, the Basel Problem, there are no such restrictions. So the assumption section here might be empty or state something about the series convergence.\n\nBut according to the user's instruction, the task is to filter unrelated information and structure the problem. The original question is asking for a complex analysis proof of the Basel Problem. The problem itself is to prove that the sum equals π²/6, using complex numbers. The assumptions would then be any conditions necessary for that proof. However, the problem as stated in the question doesn't specify any particular conditions beyond the sum. So perhaps there are no explicit assumptions here, except maybe that the series converges, which is a given in the Basel Problem.\n\nAlternatively, if the complex analysis approach uses certain properties, like the function's analyticity or residue theorem conditions, but those are part of the proof method, not assumptions of the problem itself. Since the user wants assumptions listed as per the problem's conditions, not the proof method's requirements.\n\nTherefore, in this case, the problem is to prove the Basel Problem using complex analysis. The original problem statement doesn't have any additional assumptions beyond the series definition. Hence, the assumption section might just list the series definition. Wait, but the example's assumption listed properties of the objects in the problem. For the Basel Problem, the assumption would be that the sum is from k=1 to infinity of 1/k². But that's part of the problem statement. Wait, perhaps in the example, the assumption was redundant because the problem already stated \"for every integer n,\" but the user included it as an assumption. So maybe the assumption here is that k is a positive integer, or that the series converges. But the Basel Problem is precisely about evaluating that sum. So maybe the assumptions are implicit in the problem statement. But according to the example, the assumption was split out. So in the original example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the assumption was that n is an integer (which was part of the original problem's \"for every integer n\"), and another assumption that n is divisible by 7, which perhaps was a mistake or part of a different problem.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me try to proceed. The user wants to filter unrelated information and structure the problem into Assumption and Problem sections. In the given example, assumptions were split out even if they were part of the original problem's universal quantifier. For the Basel Problem, the problem is to prove the sum equals π²/6 using complex analysis. The original question mentions that the user is aware of the Basel Problem's result and is looking for a complex number proof. So the problem here is to provide such a proof. Therefore, in terms of assumptions, perhaps there are none beyond the series definition, but the problem is to find a proof using complex analysis. However, the example included assumptions from the problem statement. Wait, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n,\" so the assumption was \"n is an integer,\" and then added \"n is divisible by 7,\" which might have been incorrect. Maybe the correct assumption should have been \"n is an integer,\" and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91 for such n. But in the formatted example, they added \"n is divisible by 7,\" which might be a mistake. So perhaps the user's example is incorrect, but we have to follow it regardless.\n\nIn the current problem, the only assumption is that the series is the sum from k=1 to infinity of 1/k². But since the problem is to prove that this sum equals π²/6 using complex analysis, the assumption might not be necessary beyond the problem statement. However, following the example's format, perhaps list the series as an assumption. But how to phrase it?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumption is that the reader is familiar with complex analysis methods, but that's not a mathematical assumption. The example listed mathematical assumptions about the objects in the problem.\n\nTherefore, given the confusion from the example, but trying to follow it, the assumption here would be that the sum converges (though that's part of the Basel Problem's result) or that k is a positive integer. But the example listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So here, maybe \"k is a positive integer\" is the assumption. But since the sum is from k=1 to infinity, that's inherent. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nk is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2} = \\frac{\\pi^2}{6}$$ using complex analysis.\n\nBut the original problem doesn't state any assumptions; it's just the sum. The example extracted \"n is an integer\" from the original problem's \"for every integer n.\" Similarly, here, the sum is over positive integers k, so perhaps that's the assumption. However, in the example, they also added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (n divisible by 7), which seems incorrect. So maybe the example is flawed, but we have to proceed as per the user's instruction.\n\nTherefore, for the Basel Problem, the assumptions would be that k ranges over positive integers, and the problem is to prove the sum equals π²/6 using complex analysis. Alternatively, maybe there are no assumptions needed beyond what's in the problem statement. The example might have had an error, but following the structure, perhaps list the convergence of the series as an assumption, but that's circular since the problem is to find its sum.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no assumptions here, and the problem is directly stated. But the example required listing assumptions. Given the confusion, perhaps the safest way is to list the definition of the series as an assumption.\n\nAssumption:\nThe series $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2}$ converges.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2} = \\frac{\\pi^2}{6}$$ using complex analysis.\n\nBut the convergence of the series is known and part of the Basel Problem's statement. However, in the example, they extracted \"n is an integer\" from \"for every integer n.\" So here, maybe \"k is a positive integer\" is the assumption.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to prove the equality using complex analysis, maybe the assumption is that complex analysis techniques are applicable, but that's part of the method, not the problem's assumptions.\n\nI think the best approach here, given the example, is to list that k is a positive integer, as that's the domain of the sum. So:\n\nAssumption:\nk is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2} = \\frac{\\pi^2}{6}$$ using complex numbers.\n\nThis follows the example's structure where assumptions are about the objects involved (n being an integer). Here, k is a positive integer, so that's an assumption. The problem then is to prove the sum equals π²/6 with complex analysis.",
