    "AcceptedAnswer": "Updated (2019-08-19). Thanks to @darij grinberg I salvaged the content of my broken blog page. But I strongly recommend the reader to see @Pranav Arora 's beautiful and neat computation first. This answer is more of 'brutal-force' solution. Let $I$ denote this integral hereafter. To achieve this, we first observe by double-angle formula that $$ \\begin{aligned}\nI\n&= \\int_{0}^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\arctan\\left(1-\\tfrac{1}{4}\\sin^2 x\\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}x \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\arctan\\left(\\tfrac{1}{8}(7+\\cos x)\\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}x \\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{4} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} \\arctan\\left(\\tfrac{1}{8}(7+\\cos x)\\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}x.\n\\end{aligned} $$ In the first and second step, we used the half-angle substitution $2x\\mapsto x$ . Then by symmetry, this is written as Then by adopting the identity $$ \\int_{1}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha^2+t^2} \\, \\mathrm{d}t = \\arctan(\\alpha) \\tag{$\\alpha > 0$}, $$ the last identity for $I$ can be recast to $$ I = 2 \\int_{1}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} \\frac{7+\\cos x}{(7+\\cos x)^2 + 64t^2} \\, \\mathrm{d}x\\mathrm{d}t. $$ Then we make change of variable $z = e^{ix}$ to obtain $$ I = \\frac{4}{i} \\int_{1}^{\\infty} \\int_{\\mathcal{C}} \\frac{z^2 + 14z + 1}{(z^2 + 14z + 1)^2 + (16tz)^2} \\, \\mathrm{d}z\\mathrm{d}t, $$ where $\\mathcal{C}$ denote the counter-clockwised unit circle centered at the origin. Now let $f(z)$ denote the integrand of the above equality. To apply Cauchy integration formula, we have to find the pole inside the circle $\\mathcal{C}$ . To this end, let $\\alpha_{\\pm}, \\beta_{\\pm}$ denote $$ \\begin{gathered}\n\\alpha_{\\pm} = -(7+8it) \\pm\\sqrt{(7+8it)^2-1}, \\\\\n\\beta_{\\pm} = -(7-8it)\\pm\\sqrt{(7-8it)^2 - 1}, \n\\end{gathered}$$ respectively. Note that $\\alpha_{\\pm}$ and $\\beta_{\\pm}$ are zeros of quadratic polynomials $$z^2 + (14+16it)z + 1 \\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad z^2 + (14-16it)z + 1$$ respectively, so that $f(z)$ factors into the form $$ f(z) = \\frac{z^2 + 14z + 1}{(z-\\alpha_+)(z - \\alpha_-)(z - \\beta_+)(z - \\beta_-)}. $$ Now for $t > 1$ , only $\\alpha_+$ and $\\beta_+$ are contained in the inside of $\\mathcal{C}$ . Thus by Cauchy integration formula, $$ \\begin{aligned}\nI\n&= 8\\pi \\int_{1}^{\\infty} \\left( \\underset{z=\\alpha_+}{\\mathrm{Res}} \\, f(z) + \\underset{z=\\beta_+}{\\mathrm{Res}} \\, f(z) \\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}t \\\\\n&= 8\\pi \\int_{1}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{1}{2(\\alpha_+ - \\alpha_-)} + \\frac{1}{2(\\beta_+ - \\beta_-)} \\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}t \\\\\n&= 2\\pi \\int_{1}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(7+8it)^2 - 1}} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(7-8it)^2 - 1}} \\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}t\n\\end{aligned} $$ To evaluate the integral in the right hand side, we note that $$ \\frac{d}{dz} \\log(z+\\sqrt{z^2-1}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{z^2 - 1}}. $$ on the right-half plane $\\{ z \\in \\mathbb{C} : \\operatorname{Re}(z) > 0\\}$ . Then we may proceed as $$\\begin{aligned}\nI\n&= \\frac{\\pi}{4i} \\left[ \\log\\left(7+8it + \\sqrt{(7+8it)^2 - 1}\\right) -  \\log\\left(7-8it + \\sqrt{(7-8it)^2 - 1}\\right) \\right]_{1}^{\\infty} \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\left[ \\arg\\left(7+8it + \\sqrt{(7+8it)^2 - 1}\\right) \\right]_{1}^{\\infty} \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\arg \\left( 7+8i + \\sqrt{(7+8i)^2 - 1}\\right) \\right).\n\\end{aligned} $$ This horrifying argument term can be simplified further by noting that $$ \\frac{1}{2}\\arg \\left( 7+8i + \\sqrt{(7+8i)^2 - 1}\\right)\n= \\frac{1}{2}\\arctan\\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{8}}{7}\\sqrt{5\\sqrt{2}+1} \\right)\n= \\arctan\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}-1}{2}}. $$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this integral problem. The user wants to prove that the integral from 0 to π/2 of arctan(1 - sin²x cos²x) dx equals π times (π/4 - arctan(sqrt((sqrt(2)-1)/2)). They mentioned trying differentiation under the integral sign with a parameter 'a' but it didn't work. Hmm, so I need to figure out another approach.\n\nFirst, let me parse the integral. The integrand is arctan(1 - sin²x cos²x). Let me see if I can simplify the expression inside the arctan. The term sin²x cos²x can be written as (sin x cos x)², which is ( (sin 2x)/2 )² = sin²(2x)/4. So 1 - sin²x cos²x = 1 - sin²(2x)/4. Wait, maybe that's helpful? Or perhaps there's a trigonometric identity to simplify further.\n\nAlternatively, maybe substituting t = sin x or t = cos x? Or a substitution involving double angles? Let's see, since the argument inside arctan is 1 - sin²x cos²x, maybe expressing sin²x cos²x in terms of cos 4x? Let me recall some identities.\n\nWe know that sin²x cos²x = (1/4) sin²(2x). And sin²(2x) can be written as (1 - cos(4x))/2. So substituting that in, 1 - (1/4) * (1 - cos(4x))/2 = 1 - (1 - cos(4x))/8 = (8 - 1 + cos(4x))/8 = (7 + cos(4x))/8. So the integrand becomes arctan( (7 + cos(4x))/8 ). Hmm, that might be a useful form.\n\nBut integrating arctan of a trigonometric function over 0 to π/2... That still seems challenging. Maybe there's a substitution or symmetry to exploit. Let's consider the integral I = ∫₀^{π/2} arctan(1 - sin²x cos²x) dx. Let me check if substitution x = π/2 - u would help, but since the limits are symmetric from 0 to π/2, maybe that won't change much.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express the arctan in terms of an integral. We know that arctan(z) = ∫₀^z 1/(1 + t²) dt. But not sure if that helps here. Alternatively, differentiating under the integral sign. The user tried introducing a parameter 'a' into the integrand, replacing 1 with a, but that didn't work. Maybe there's a different parameterization?\n\nWait, let's think about the original integral. The answer involves sqrt( (sqrt(2)-1)/2 ). Let me compute that expression: sqrt( (sqrt(2)-1)/2 ). Let's square it: (sqrt(2)-1)/(2) ≈ (1.4142 -1)/2 ≈ 0.2071. So the square root of that is approx 0.455, but maybe there's a trigonometric interpretation here. Perhaps tan(theta) = sqrt( (sqrt(2)-1)/2 ), so theta would be arctan of that, which is part of the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using substitution to simplify the integral. Let me think about substitution for the integrand. Let’s denote y = 4x or something? Since there's a cos(4x) term. Let’s set t = 4x, then when x=0, t=0; x=π/2, t=2π. Hmm, but integrating over 0 to 2π might complicate things, but maybe symmetry can be used. Alternatively, considering periodicity.\n\nWait, but the original integral is from 0 to π/2, so t = 4x would go from 0 to 2π, but integrating over that interval may not directly help. Alternatively, perhaps split the integral into parts where cos(4x) has certain symmetries.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express arctan in terms of imaginary logarithms. Recall that arctan(z) = (1/(2i)) log( (1 + iz)/(1 - iz) ). But that might complicate things more.\n\nWait, another thought: sometimes integrals involving arctan can be tackled via integration by parts. Let me try that. Let u = arctan(1 - sin²x cos²x), dv = dx. Then du would be derivative of arctan(...) times the derivative of the inside, and v = x. But integrating by parts would lead to v du, which might not be simpler. Let me compute du:\n\nd/dx [ arctan(f(x)) ] = f’(x)/(1 + f(x)^2 )\n\nHere, f(x) = 1 - sin²x cos²x. Then f’(x) = -2 sinx cosx * cos²x + sin²x * 2 sinx cosx. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, f(x) = 1 - sin²x cos²x, so f’(x) = - derivative of sin²x cos²x.\n\nCompute derivative of sin²x cos²x:\n\nd/dx [ sin²x cos²x ] = 2 sinx cosx * cos²x + sin²x * 2 cosx (-sinx )\n\nWait, more carefully:\n\nUse product rule: d/dx [ sin²x * cos²x ] = 2 sinx cosx * cos²x + sin²x * 2 cosx (-sinx )\n\nSimplify:\n\nFirst term: 2 sinx cosx * cos²x = 2 sinx cos³x\n\nSecond term: 2 sin²x cosx (-sinx ) = -2 sin³x cosx\n\nSo combined: 2 sinx cos³x - 2 sin³x cosx = 2 sinx cosx (cos²x - sin²x) = 2 sinx cosx cos(2x )\n\nTherefore, f’(x) = - derivative of sin²x cos²x = -2 sinx cosx cos(2x )\n\nTherefore, du = [ -2 sinx cosx cos(2x ) ] / [1 + (1 - sin²x cos²x )^2 ] dx\n\nHmm, integrating by parts would give:\n\nI = x arctan(...) from 0 to π/2 - ∫₀^{π/2} x * [ -2 sinx cosx cos(2x ) / (1 + (1 - sin²x cos²x )^2 ] dx\n\nBut evaluating the first term: at π/2, x arctan(1 - sin²(π/2) cos²(π/2)) = π/2 * arctan(1 - 1*0) = π/2 * arctan(1) = π/2 * π/4 = π²/8\n\nAt 0, it's 0. So the first term is π²/8. Then the integral becomes π²/8 - ∫₀^{π/2} x * [ -2 sinx cosx cos(2x ) / (1 + (1 - sin²x cos²x )^2 ] dx\n\nBut this seems more complicated. Maybe integration by parts isn't the right approach here.\n\nAlternatively, the user mentioned that differentiation under the integral sign with parameter 'a' didn't work. Maybe another substitution or parametrization. Let me think about possible substitutions.\n\nLet me consider substituting t = sinx cosx. Then dt/dx = cos²x - sin²x = cos(2x). But not sure. Alternatively, let me set u = sinx or u = cosx. Hmm.\n\nWait, the expression inside arctan is 1 - sin²x cos²x. Let me denote k = sin²x cos²x. Then the integrand is arctan(1 - k). Maybe there's a symmetry when we consider k and 1 - k.\n\nAlternatively, since the integral is from 0 to π/2, perhaps use substitution x = π/2 - y. Then sinx becomes cos y and cosx becomes sin y, but sin²x cos²x would become sin²y cos²y, same as before. So the integrand is symmetric, so substitution doesn't change the integral. So that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the identity arctan(z) + arctan(1/z) = π/2 for z > 0. If I can express the integrand in terms of arctan(z) and arctan(1/z), but not sure how.\n\nWait, let's compute 1 - sin²x cos²x. Let's note that sin²x cos²x = (sinx cosx)^2 = ( (sin 2x)/2 )^2 = sin²(2x)/4. Therefore, 1 - sin²x cos²x = 1 - sin²(2x)/4. So the integrand becomes arctan(1 - sin²(2x)/4). Maybe substituting t = 2x. Let’s try that. Let t = 2x, so when x=0, t=0; x=π/2, t=π. Then dx = dt/2. The integral becomes (1/2) ∫₀^π arctan(1 - (sin²t)/4) dt. But integrating from 0 to π. Hmm, perhaps use symmetry here. The function sin²t is symmetric around π/2, so maybe split the integral into 0 to π/2 and π/2 to π. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, use the identity sin²t = (1 - cos(2t))/2. Then 1 - (sin²t)/4 = 1 - (1 - cos(2t))/8 = (8 - 1 + cos(2t))/8 = (7 + cos(2t))/8. So the integrand becomes arctan( (7 + cos(2t))/8 ). So the integral is (1/2) ∫₀^π arctan( (7 + cos(2t))/8 ) dt. Hmm, this looks similar to some standard integral forms. Maybe there's a formula for ∫ arctan(a + b cos t) dt over 0 to π or something. But I don't recall such a formula.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use complex analysis? Not sure, that might be overkill. Alternatively, consider expanding arctan in a series. But that seems complicated.\n\nWait, another idea. Let's recall that for certain integrals involving arctan, substitution using tangent of the angle might help. Let me denote θ = arctan( something ), but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the result involves sqrt( (sqrt(2)-1)/2 ), which looks like tan(π/8) or something. Let me compute tan(π/8). We know that tan(π/8) = sqrt(2) - 1 ≈ 0.4142. But sqrt( (sqrt(2)-1)/2 ) ≈ sqrt(0.2071) ≈ 0.455, which is not exactly tan(π/8). Wait, but maybe it's related to another angle.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute the expression inside the arctan in the result: sqrt( (sqrt(2)-1)/2 ). Let's square it: (sqrt(2)-1)/2 ≈ (1.4142 -1)/2 ≈ 0.2071. So the expression inside arctan is approximately sqrt(0.2071) ≈ 0.455. So maybe that's tan(theta) where theta is some angle. Let me see, tan(theta) = sqrt( (sqrt(2)-1)/2 ). Let's square both sides: tan²(theta) = (sqrt(2)-1)/2. Then using the identity 1 + tan²(theta) = sec²(theta), so sec²(theta) = 1 + (sqrt(2)-1)/2 = (2 + sqrt(2) -1)/2 = (1 + sqrt(2))/2. Therefore, cos²(theta) = 2/(1 + sqrt(2)) = 2(1 - sqrt(2))/(1 - 2) = 2(sqrt(2) -1 )/1. Wait, wait:\n\nWait, cos²(theta) = 1 / sec²(theta) = 2/(1 + sqrt(2)). Rationalizing the denominator:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (1 - sqrt(2)):\n\n2*(1 - sqrt(2)) / [ (1 + sqrt(2))(1 - sqrt(2)) ] = 2*(1 - sqrt(2)) / (1 - 2) = 2*(1 - sqrt(2))/(-1) = 2*(sqrt(2) -1 )\n\nTherefore, cos(theta) = sqrt(2*(sqrt(2)-1)). Hmm, but not sure if this is helpful. Maybe that angle theta is related to π/8 or something. Let's compute cos(theta):\n\nsqrt(2*(sqrt(2)-1)) ≈ sqrt(2*(1.4142 -1)) ≈ sqrt(2*0.4142) ≈ sqrt(0.8284) ≈ 0.910. So theta ≈ arccos(0.910) ≈ 24.5 degrees. Not a standard angle, but maybe there's a relation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the integral can be connected to a geometric interpretation or another integral that's known.\n\nWait, going back to the original integral: ∫₀^{π/2} arctan(1 - sin²x cos²x) dx.\n\nMaybe parametrizing with substitution t = tanx. Let’s try that. Let t = tanx, so x = arctan t, dx = dt/(1 + t²). When x=0, t=0; x=π/2, t→∞. But integrating from 0 to ∞ might complicate things, but let's see.\n\nExpress sinx and cosx in terms of t: sinx = t/sqrt(1 + t²), cosx = 1/sqrt(1 + t²). Then sin²x cos²x = t²/(1 + t²)². So 1 - sin²x cos²x = 1 - t²/(1 + t²)² = [ (1 + t²)^2 - t² ] / (1 + t²)^2 = [1 + 2t² + t^4 - t²]/(1 + t²)^2 = [1 + t² + t^4]/(1 + t²)^2.\n\nTherefore, the integrand becomes arctan( [1 + t² + t^4]/(1 + t²)^2 ). Hmm, not sure if this helps. Maybe simplifying the argument inside arctan:\n\n[1 + t² + t^4]/(1 + t²)^2 = [t^4 + t² +1]/(t^4 + 2t² +1) = Let's write numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: t^4 + t² +1\n\nDenominator: t^4 + 2t² +1 = (t² +1)^2\n\nSo the expression is (t^4 + t² +1)/(t² +1)^2. Let me see if this can be written as 1 - something:\n\n= 1 - [ (t² +1)^2 - (t^4 + t² +1) ] / (t² +1)^2\n\nCompute numerator inside the bracket:\n\n(t^4 + 2t² +1) - (t^4 + t² +1) = t². So expression becomes 1 - t²/(t² +1)^2. Wait, but this is 1 - sin²x cos²x again, so that's just restating the original expression. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express [1 + t² + t^4]/(1 + t²)^2 as 1 - t²/(1 + t²)^2. But not sure.\n\nAnother idea: maybe use substitution u = t², but I don't see the benefit.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the integral might relate to some known integral formula involving arctan and rational functions. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, the original result given is π(π/4 - arctan(sqrt( (sqrt(2)-1)/2 )). Let me compute that expression:\n\nFirst, sqrt( (sqrt(2)-1)/2 ) ≈ sqrt(0.2071) ≈ 0.455. Then arctan(0.455) ≈ 0.43 radians. Then π/4 ≈ 0.785 radians. So π(0.785 -0.43 ) ≈ π(0.355) ≈ 1.116. But the integral is from 0 to π/2 of arctan(...) dx. So the result is approximately 1.116. Let me check with approximate integral.\n\nWait, but I need to actually compute the integral, not approximate. Let me think of another approach.\n\nWait, maybe the integral can be related to a double integral or by switching the order of integration. Since arctan(z) = ∫₀^z 1/(1 + t²) dt, perhaps express the original integral as a double integral:\n\nI = ∫₀^{π/2} [ ∫₀^{1 - sin²x cos²x} 1/(1 + t²) dt ] dx\n\nThen switch the order of integration. Let's see:\n\nThe region is 0 ≤ x ≤ π/2, 0 ≤ t ≤ 1 - sin²x cos²x. To switch the order, we need to find for each t, the x such that t ≤ 1 - sin²x cos²x, which is equivalent to sin²x cos²x ≤ 1 - t.\n\nBut sin²x cos²x ≤ 1/16, since maximum of sin²x cos²x is when sinx = cosx = 1/√2, so (1/2)*(1/2) = 1/4, then squared is 1/16. Wait, actually, sinx cosx = (sin 2x)/2, so maximum value of sinx cosx is 1/2, so sin²x cos²x maximum is 1/4. Therefore, 1 - sin²x cos²x ≥ 1 - 1/4 = 3/4. Wait, but the original integrand is arctan(1 - sin²x cos²x), so the argument inside arctan is between 3/4 and 1, since sin²x cos²x varies between 0 and 1/4. Therefore, 1 - sin²x cos²x ∈ [3/4, 1]. So the inner integral's upper limit is between 3/4 and 1. So t ∈ [0,1], but actually t ∈ [3/4,1]. Wait, but when switching the order, the limits for t would be from 3/4 to 1, and for each t, x must satisfy sin²x cos²x ≤ 1 - t.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Let me attempt to proceed.\n\nThe region of integration is 0 ≤ x ≤ π/2 and 0 ≤ t ≤ 1 - sin²x cos²x. To switch, for t from 0 to 1, x ranges over the set where sin²x cos²x ≤ 1 - t. But since sin²x cos²x ≤ 1/4, when 1 - t ≥ 1/4, i.e., t ≤ 3/4, then sin²x cos²x ≤ 1 - t is always true. Therefore, for t ∈ [0, 3/4], x ranges from 0 to π/2. For t ∈ [3/4, 1], x ranges over the set where sin²x cos²x ≤ 1 - t. So:\n\nI = ∫_{t=0}^{3/4} [ ∫_{x=0}^{π/2} 1/(1 + t²) dx ] dt + ∫_{t=3/4}^1 [ ∫_{x: sin²x cos²x ≤ 1 - t} 1/(1 + t²) dx ] dt\n\nCompute the first integral: ∫₀^{3/4} (π/2)/(1 + t²) dt = (π/2) arctan(t) from 0 to 3/4 = (π/2)( arctan(3/4) - 0 ) = (π/2) arctan(3/4)\n\nThe second integral is ∫_{3/4}^1 [ measure of x ∈ [0, π/2] where sin²x cos²x ≤ 1 - t } / (1 + t²) dt\n\nBut measure of x where sin²x cos²x ≤ 1 - t. Let me denote y = sin²x cos²x. We need to find the measure (length) of x where y ≤ 1 - t. Let's solve sin²x cos²x ≤ 1 - t. Let me set z = sin(2x)/2, so sin²x cos²x = z². Then the inequality becomes z² ≤ 1 - t, so |z| ≤ sqrt(1 - t). Since z = sin(2x)/2, which is between -1/2 and 1/2. So the inequality becomes |sin(2x)/2| ≤ sqrt(1 - t), which implies |sin(2x)| ≤ 2 sqrt(1 - t)\n\nBut since x ∈ [0, π/2], 2x ∈ [0, π]. So sin(2x) ∈ [0,1] for x ∈ [0, π/4], and sin(2x) ∈ [1,0] for x ∈ [π/4, π/2]. Therefore, |sin(2x)| = sin(2x) for x ∈ [0, π/2].\n\nSo the inequality is sin(2x) ≤ 2 sqrt(1 - t). Let me denote s = 2x, so s ∈ [0, π]. The measure of s where sin(s) ≤ 2 sqrt(1 - t). The length of s in [0, π] where sin(s) ≤ 2 sqrt(1 - t).\n\nLet’s denote k = 2 sqrt(1 - t). Since t ∈ [3/4,1], 1 - t ∈ [0,1/4], so k = 2 sqrt(1 - t) ∈ [0,1]. So we have to find the measure of s ∈ [0, π] where sin(s) ≤ k.\n\nFor k ≥ 1, this is the entire interval [0, π]. But here k ≤1, so the measure is 2 arcsin(k) + (π - 2 arcsin(k)) = π? Wait, no. Wait, the solutions to sin(s) ≤ k in [0, π] are s ∈ [0, arcsin(k)] ∪ [π - arcsin(k), π]. So the total measure is arcsin(k) + arcsin(k) = 2 arcsin(k). Wait, no: for s ∈ [0, π], sin(s) ≤ k when s ∈ [0, arcsin(k)] ∪ [π - arcsin(k), π]. The length is arcsin(k) + arcsin(k) = 2 arcsin(k). But wait, when k <1, arcsin(k) is in [0, π/2]. So yes, the total measure is 2 arcsin(k).\n\nTherefore, the measure of x in [0, π/2] is (measure of s)/2 = arcsin(k)/1. Because s = 2x, so x = s/2. So the measure for x is [ arcsin(k)/2 + (π - arcsin(k))/2 ]? Wait, perhaps I messed up.\n\nWait, if s ∈ [0, arcsin(k)] ∪ [π - arcsin(k), π], then x = s/2 ∈ [0, arcsin(k)/2] ∪ [ (π - arcsin(k))/2, π/2 ]. The total measure is [arcsin(k)/2 -0] + [π/2 - (π - arcsin(k))/2] = arcsin(k)/2 + (π/2 - π/2 + arcsin(k)/2 ) = arcsin(k)/2 + arcsin(k)/2 = arcsin(k). So the measure is arcsin(k).\n\nBut k = 2 sqrt(1 - t). So the measure is arcsin(2 sqrt(1 - t)).\n\nTherefore, the second integral becomes ∫_{t=3/4}^1 [ arcsin(2 sqrt(1 - t)) / (1 + t²) ] dt\n\nTherefore, the entire integral I is:\n\n(π/2) arctan(3/4) + ∫_{3/4}^1 [ arcsin(2 sqrt(1 - t)) / (1 + t²) ] dt\n\nBut this seems very complicated. Maybe a substitution in the second integral. Let me set u = sqrt(1 - t). Then t = 1 - u², dt = -2u du. When t=3/4, u=sqrt(1 - 3/4) = sqrt(1/4)=1/2. When t=1, u=0. So the integral becomes:\n\n∫_{u=1/2}^0 [ arcsin(2u) / (1 + (1 - u²)^2 ) ] (-2u du) = ∫₀^{1/2} [ arcsin(2u) * 2u / (1 + (1 - u²)^2 ) ] du\n\nHmm, still complicated. Not sure if this helps. Maybe another substitution. Let me set v = 2u, then u = v/2, du = dv/2. The limits become v=0 to v=1. The integral becomes:\n\n∫₀^1 [ arcsin(v) * (v/2) * 2 / (1 + (1 - (v/2)^2 )^2 ) ] (dv/2)\n\nWait, simplifying:\n\n= ∫₀^1 [ arcsin(v) * v / 2 ] / (1 + (1 - v²/4 )^2 ) dv\n\nHmm, not helpful. This approach seems leading me nowhere. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nWait, going back to the original problem. The user mentions that sos440 computed this integral. Maybe looking for known integrals or techniques sos440 often uses. From what I recall, sos440 often uses clever substitutions, differentiation under the integral, contour integration, or Fourier series.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the integral has a form that can be related to the integral of arctan(a + b cosx) or similar. Maybe look for such integrals.\n\nAlternatively, use substitution to symmetrize the integral. Let me consider writing the integral in terms of t = π/2 - x. But as before, the integrand is symmetric, so it won't change.\n\nWait, another idea: express the integrand using tan addition formulas. Since the result involves arctan, maybe there's a way to express the integrand as a difference of arctan terms.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the integral might be expressible as π times some constant, as the result is π times something. That suggests that the integral might be related to an average value over the interval, multiplied by the length π/2. But no, the result is π*(something), but the interval is of length π/2. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's check the dimensions. The integral is over 0 to π/2, so the answer is of the order π/2 times something. But the given result is π*(π/4 - arctan(...)). Which is π times a term. So maybe the integral can be expressed as π times a constant due to some symmetry or periodicity.\n\nAlternatively, think of the integral as the sum over two intervals or exploit even-odd symmetries.\n\nAlternatively, consider using the integral formula for arctan:\n\narctan(z) = ∫₀^1 z/(1 + z² t²) dt\n\nBut substituting this into the original integral gives a double integral. Let me try:\n\nI = ∫₀^{π/2} [ ∫₀^1 [ (1 - sin²x cos²x)/(1 + (1 - sin²x cos²x)^2 t²) ] dt ] dx\n\nSwitching the order:\n\nI = ∫₀^1 [ ∫₀^{π/2} (1 - sin²x cos²x)/(1 + (1 - sin²x cos²x)^2 t²) dx ] dt\n\nBut this seems more complicated. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: numerical verification. Let me approximate the integral numerically and see if it matches the given result.\n\nCompute the left-hand side: ∫₀^{π/2} arctan(1 - sin²x cos²x) dx.\n\nLet me compute this numerically. Let's take x from 0 to π/2. Let's choose a few sample points.\n\nAt x=0: sin0=0, cos0=1, so sin²0 cos²0=0, integrand=arctan(1)=π/4≈0.785.\n\nAt x=π/4: sin(π/4)=cos(π/4)=√2/2, so sin²x cos²x=(1/2)*(1/2)=1/4, so integrand=arctan(1 -1/4)=arctan(3/4)≈0.6435.\n\nAt x=π/2: similar to x=0, integrand=π/4.\n\nThe function arctan(1 - sin²x cos²x) is symmetric around π/4, reaching minimum at π/4. So the integral would be roughly the average of π/4 and arctan(3/4) multiplied by π/2.\n\nBut approximate value:\n\nLet's take a rough average: (π/4 + arctan(3/4))/2 ≈ (0.785 + 0.6435)/2 ≈ 0.714. Multiply by π/2 ≈ 1.5708: 0.714 * 1.5708 ≈ 1.12. The given result is π*(π/4 - arctan(sqrt(...))). Compute π*(π/4 - arctan(sqrt((sqrt(2)-1)/2)):\n\nFirst compute sqrt((sqrt(2)-1)/2) ≈ sqrt(0.2071)≈0.455, then arctan(0.455)≈0.43 radians. π/4≈0.785. So 0.785 -0.43≈0.355. Multiply by π≈3.1416: 0.355*3.1416≈1.115. So the approximate value matches. So the given formula is correct.\n\nBut to prove it analytically, need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, let's consider differentiating with respect to a parameter, but maybe not the one the user tried. Let me define:\n\nI(a) = ∫₀^{π/2} arctan(a - sin²x cos²x) dx\n\nThen the original integral is I(1). The user tried differentiating I(a) with respect to a, but perhaps integrating with respect to a? Or find a differential equation for I(a).\n\nCompute dI/da = ∫₀^{π/2} [1/(1 + (a - sin²x cos²x)^2 ) ] dx\n\nBut integrating this expression with respect to a might not be straightforward. However, perhaps if we can express this derivative in terms of I(a) or other known functions.\n\nAlternatively, consider specific values. For example, when a=1, we have the original integral. If we can find I(a) for general a, then set a=1.\n\nBut how to find I(a). Let me see if changing variables helps. Let’s set t = a - sin²x cos²x. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, note that sin²x cos²x = (sin2x)^2 /4. So I(a) = ∫₀^{π/2} arctan(a - (sin2x)^2 /4 ) dx\n\nLet me substitute y = 2x, so dy=2dx, x=y/2, limits from 0 to π.\n\nI(a) = (1/2) ∫₀^{π} arctan(a - (sin y)^2 /4 ) dy\n\nSince the integrand is even around π/2, maybe split into [0, π/2] and [π/2, π], but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, use the identity that ∫₀^{π} f(sin y) dy = 2 ∫₀^{π/2} f(sin y) dy. So I(a) = (1/2)*2 ∫₀^{π/2} arctan(a - (sin y)^2 /4 ) dy = ∫₀^{π/2} arctan(a - (sin y)^2 /4 ) dy\n\nWhich is similar to the original integral but with a parameter a. So not helpful.\n\nWait, but maybe differentiate I(a) with respect to a:\n\nI’(a) = ∫₀^{π/2} [1 / (1 + (a - sin²x cos²x)^2 ) ] dx\n\nThis seems related to standard integrals. Perhaps if we can compute I’(a) and then integrate from a=0 to a=1.\n\nBut how to compute I’(a). Let me consider substitution. Let’s denote u = sinx cosx. Then du = cos2x dx. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, express sin²x cos²x in terms of cos4x. As before, sin²x cos²x = (1 - cos4x)/8. So a - sin²x cos²x = a - (1 - cos4x)/8 = (8a -1 + cos4x)/8.\n\nThus, I’(a) = ∫₀^{π/2} 1 / [1 + ((8a -1 + cos4x)/8 )^2 ] dx\n\nLet me set z = 4x, then dz=4dx, x=z/4, limits from 0 to 2π.\n\nI’(a) = (1/4) ∫₀^{2π} 1 / [1 + ((8a -1 + cosz)/8 )^2 ] dz\n\nBut integrating over 0 to 2π, we can use the formula for integrals of the form ∫₀^{2π} 1/(A + B cosz) dz. But here the denominator is 1 + [ (8a -1 + cosz)/8 ]^2.\n\nLet me expand that:\n\nDenominator = 1 + [ (8a -1 + cosz)/8 ]^2 = 1 + ( (8a -1)^2 + 2(8a -1)cosz + cos²z ) / 64\n\n= (64 + (8a -1)^2 + 2(8a -1)cosz + cos²z ) / 64\n\nThus, I’(a) = (1/4) * 64 ∫₀^{2π} [ 1 / (64 + (8a -1)^2 + 2(8a -1)cosz + cos²z ) ] dz\n\n= 16 ∫₀^{2π} [ 1 / (64 + (8a -1)^2 + 2(8a -1)cosz + cos²z ) ] dz\n\nThis integral can be evaluated using the method of residues or by using known integral formulas. Let me check if this denominator can be expressed as a quadratic in cosz.\n\nLet me denote D = cos²z + 2(8a -1)cosz + (64 + (8a -1)^2 )\n\n= cos²z + 2(8a -1)cosz + (8a -1)^2 + 64\n\n= [cosz + (8a -1)]² + 64\n\nTherefore, the integral becomes:\n\n16 ∫₀^{2π} [ 1 / ( [cosz + (8a -1)]² + 64 ) ] dz\n\nThis is of the form ∫₀^{2π} 1/( (cosz + c)^2 + d ) dz, where c=8a -1 and d=64.\n\nThis integral can be evaluated using contour integration. Let me recall that integrals of the form ∫₀^{2π} 1/(A + B cosz) dz = 2π/sqrt(A² - B²). But here it's more complicated due to the square.\n\nAlternatively, use the substitution t = tan(z/2), which transforms the integral into a rational function integral. Let me try that.\n\nLet t = tan(z/2), then dz = 2/(1 + t²) dt, and cosz = (1 - t²)/(1 + t²). The integral becomes:\n\n16 ∫_{t=0}^{∞} [ 1 / ( [ (1 - t²)/(1 + t²) + c ]² + 64 ) ] * 2/(1 + t²) dt\n\nBut this seems very complicated. Let me denote c =8a -1.\n\nThen the denominator inside the integral becomes:\n\n[ ( (1 - t²) + c(1 + t²) ) / (1 + t²) ]² + 64\n\n= [ (1 - t² + c + c t² ) / (1 + t²) ]² + 64\n\n= [ ( (c -1) t² + (1 + c) ) / (1 + t²) ]² + 64\n\nThis is getting too messy. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, use the identity that for real numbers, ∫₀^{2π} dz/(A + B cosz + C cos²z ) can be expressed in terms of elliptic integrals or other special functions, but I don't recall the exact formula.\n\nGiven the complexity of this route, perhaps a different approach is needed. Let me think back to the original problem and the answer's form. The result has arctan(sqrt( (sqrt(2)-1)/2 ), which resembles half-angle formulas or substitution.\n\nLet me recall that sqrt( (sqrt(2)-1)/2 ) is related to sin(π/8) or cos(π/8). Let's compute sin(π/8) = sin(22.5°) = sqrt(2 - sqrt(2))/2 ≈ 0.38268. Squared: (2 - sqrt(2))/4 ≈ (2 - 1.4142)/4 ≈ 0.1464. Whereas (sqrt(2)-1)/2 ≈ (1.4142 -1)/2 ≈ 0.2071. So sqrt(0.2071) ≈ 0.455, which is cos(π/8) ≈ 0.9238. No, not quite. Wait, cos(π/8) = sqrt(2 + sqrt(2))/2 ≈ 0.9238, so not directly related.\n\nAlternatively, maybe tan(π/8) = sqrt(2)-1 ≈ 0.4142, and sqrt( (sqrt(2)-1)/2 ) ≈ sqrt(0.2071) ≈ 0.455, which is sqrt(tan(π/8)). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me set theta = arctan( sqrt( (sqrt(2)-1)/2 ) ). Then tan(theta) = sqrt( (sqrt(2)-1)/2 ). Squaring both sides: tan²(theta) = (sqrt(2)-1)/2. Then 1 + tan²(theta) = sec²(theta) = 1 + (sqrt(2)-1)/2 = (2 + sqrt(2) -1)/2 = (1 + sqrt(2))/2. Therefore, cos²(theta) = 2/(1 + sqrt(2)) = 2(sqrt(2)-1)/ ( (1 + sqrt(2))(sqrt(2)-1) ) = 2(sqrt(2)-1)/ (2 -1) )= 2(sqrt(2)-1). So cos(theta) = sqrt(2(sqrt(2)-1)) ≈ sqrt(2*0.4142) ≈ sqrt(0.8284) ≈ 0.910. So theta ≈ arccos(0.910) ≈ 24.5 degrees, which is π/7.5 roughly. Not a standard angle, but maybe there's a relation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the integral can be expressed as a sum of two terms involving arctan, and through symmetry or substitution, the result can be derived. \n\nAnother approach: consider expanding arctan(1 - sin²x cos²x) into a Fourier series or a series expansion, then integrate term-by-term. However, this might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, note that 1 - sin²x cos²x = 1 - (sinx cosx)^2. Let me set u = sinx cosx, then du = cos2x dx. But the integral becomes arctan(1 - u²) * dx. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, use substitution v = u = tanx, but tried that earlier.\n\nWait, going back to the original answer: π*(π/4 - arctan(...)). This suggests that the integral is π multiplied by some angle difference. Perhaps the integral can be related to the integral of an angle function over the interval, which integrates to π times the average angle.\n\nAlternatively, considering complex logarithms. Let me think.\n\nRecall that arctan(z) = Im( log(1 + iz) ). So maybe express the integral as the imaginary part of the integral of log(1 + i(1 - sin²x cos²x)) dx from 0 to π/2. But integrating log(1 + i(...)) seems difficult.\n\nAlternatively, think of the integral as the imaginary part of a complex integral, which might be evaluated using contour integration. But this is probably overkill.\n\nAnother idea: Let’s consider writing 1 - sin²x cos²x as a product or using tangent half-angle substitution.\n\nWait, I'm stuck. Let me look for resources or similar integrals. Wait, I recall that integrals of arctan(a + b cosx) can sometimes be evaluated using series expansion or integration by parts, but I don't remember the exact method.\n\nAlternatively, consider that 1 - sin²x cos²x = 1 - (1/4) sin²(2x) as before. Let me use substitution t = 2x, then dt = 2dx, x = t/2, limits from 0 to π. The integral becomes (1/2) ∫₀^π arctan(1 - (1/4) sin²t ) dt. Then, using the identity sin²t = (1 - cos2t)/2, so 1 - (1/4) sin²t = 1 - (1/8)(1 - cos2t) = 1 - 1/8 + (1/8) cos2t = 7/8 + (1/8) cos2t. So the integral becomes (1/2) ∫₀^π arctan(7/8 + (1/8) cos2t ) dt. This seems similar to integrating arctan(a + b cos2t) over 0 to π. Perhaps there's a symmetry or substitution for this.\n\nLet me set u = 2t, so when t=0, u=0; t=π, u=2π. Then the integral becomes (1/4) ∫₀^{2π} arctan(7/8 + (1/8) cosu ) du. Now, this is integrating arctan(7/8 + (1/8) cosu ) over a full period. Maybe using the average value over a period.\n\nFor integrals over a full period of arctan(a + b cosu), perhaps there's a formula. Let me check.\n\nI recall that for integrals ∫₀^{2π} arctan(a + b cosu) du, if we can find a substitution or symmetry, but I don't recall a standard formula. However, maybe differentiating with respect to a parameter. Let me define J(b) = ∫₀^{2π} arctan(a + b cosu) du. Then dJ/db = ∫₀^{2π} [ cosu / (1 + (a + b cosu)^2 ) ] du. But this integral might be zero due to odd function properties. Wait, if we integrate cosu/(1 + (a + b cosu)^2 ) from 0 to 2π, since cosu is odd around π, and the denominator is even, the integral might be zero. Wait, but the denominator is 1 + (a + b cosu)^2, which is even in cosu. So the entire integrand is an odd function around π, hence integrating over 0 to 2π would give zero. Therefore, dJ/db = 0, implying J(b) is constant with respect to b. But that can't be right. Wait, no, the function is not odd around π. Wait, substitution u = 2π - t. Then cosu = cos(2π -t) = cos t. So the integrand becomes cos(2π -t) / [1 + (a + b cos(2π -t))^2 ] = cos t / [1 + (a + b cos t)^2 ] which is the same as the original integrand. So the integral from 0 to 2π is equal to twice the integral from 0 to π. But the integrand is even around π, so integrating from 0 to 2π of cosu/(...) du is twice the integral from 0 to π. But wait, cosu is symmetric around π. However, integrating cosu over 0 to π and π to 2π would give equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. Because cosu from π to 2π is -cos(u - π). Therefore, the integral over 0 to 2π would be zero. Therefore, dJ/db = 0, hence J(b) is independent of b. This suggests that J(b) = J(0) = ∫₀^{2π} arctan(a) du = 2π arctan(a). But this can't be correct, as the original integral depends on b. There must be a mistake in this reasoning.\n\nWait, actually, if a + b cosu is always positive, then arctan(a + b cosu) is a smooth function. But differentiating with respect to b gives an integral that might not be zero. Let me test with a specific case.\n\nTake a=1, b=0. Then J(0) = ∫₀^{2π} arctan(1) du = ∫₀^{2π} π/4 du = (π/4)*2π = π²/2. Now, for b≠0, J(b) should differ, but according to previous reasoning, dJ/db=0, implying J(b) is constant. But this is false. Therefore, my earlier conclusion that dJ/db=0 is incorrect.\n\nThe mistake is in assuming that the integrand cosu/(1 + (a + b cosu)^2 ) is an odd function. Let me check parity. If we substitute u → 2π -u, then cosu → cos(2π -u)=cosu. So the integrand is even under this substitution. Therefore, integrating from 0 to 2π gives twice the integral from 0 to π. Therefore, the integral is not necessarily zero. Hence, my earlier conclusion was wrong.\n\nTherefore, this approach is invalid. Let me abandon it.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for a different method. Let me think back to the original problem's answer. The result is π*(π/4 - arctan(...)). Maybe the integral can be expressed as π times the difference between π/4 and some arctan term, which suggests that the integrand's average value is (π/4 - arctan(...)).\n\nAlternatively, consider that the integral could be split into two parts: ∫₀^{π/2} arctan(1) dx - ∫₀^{π/2} [ arctan(1) - arctan(1 - sin²x cos²x) ] dx. But since arctan(1) = π/4, the first term is π/4 * π/2 = π²/8. If the given answer is π*(π/4 - arctan(...)), which is π²/4 - π arctan(...), and π²/8 is half of π²/4, so this might not help.\n\nAlternatively, use the identity arctan(a) - arctan(b) = arctan( (a - b)/(1 + ab) ). Maybe express the integrand as a difference of two arctan terms.\n\nLet me consider that 1 - sin²x cos²x = [1 + something]/[1 - something]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider that 1 - sin²x cos²x = tan(π/4 - theta) where theta is related to sin²x cos²x. But not helpful.\n\nGiven that I'm not making progress, I'll switch gears and look for a substitution that can linearize the argument inside arctan. Let me set t = tan(phi), so phi = arctan(t). But not sure.\n\nWait, going back to the answer, the expression inside the arctan is sqrt( (sqrt(2)-1)/2 ). Let me denote this as alpha. So alpha = sqrt( (sqrt(2)-1)/2 ). Let me square alpha: alpha² = (sqrt(2)-1)/2. Then 2 alpha² = sqrt(2)-1, so sqrt(2) = 2 alpha² +1. Squaring both sides: 2 = (2 alpha² +1)^2 = 4 alpha^4 +4 alpha² +1. Rearranging: 4 alpha^4 +4 alpha² -1 =0. This is a quadratic in alpha²: let beta = alpha². Then 4 beta² +4 beta -1=0. Solving: beta = [-4 ± sqrt(16 +16)]/8 = [-4 ± sqrt(32)]/8 = [-4 ±4 sqrt(2)]/8 = [ -1 ± sqrt(2) ] /2. Since alpha² is positive, beta = [ -1 + sqrt(2) ] /2. Which matches alpha² = (sqrt(2)-1)/2. So this checks out.\n\nNot sure if this helps, but it shows that alpha is related to sqrt( sqrt(2) -1 ).\n\nAnother thought: maybe the integral can be connected to an integral over a different interval or via a substitution that introduces a parameter related to sqrt(2)-1.\n\nWait, considering the answer involves sqrt( (sqrt(2)-1)/2 ), perhaps a substitution using theta where tan(theta) = sqrt( (sqrt(2)-1)/2 ), which would relate to some angle addition formula.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the original integral might relate to the integral of the argument of a complex function. For example, if we can write 1 - sin²x cos²x as the real part of some complex exponential, then the arctan would be the argument. But this is vague.\n\nAlternatively, consider that 1 - sin²x cos²x = 1 - (1/4) sin²(2x) = 1 - (1/8)(1 - cos4x). So 1 - sin²x cos²x = 7/8 + (1/8)cos4x. Thus, the integrand is arctan(7/8 + (1/8) cos4x). Let me denote this as arctan(a + b cos4x) with a=7/8 and b=1/8. Maybe there's a Fourier series for this function.\n\nExpand arctan(a + b cos4x) in a Fourier series. This would be complicated, but perhaps if we can integrate term by term.\n\nAlternatively, use the expansion:\n\narctan(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty (-1)^n z^{2n+1}/(2n+1) for |z| ≤1.\n\nBut here z =7/8 + (1/8) cos4x, which varies between 6/8=3/4 and 8/8=1. So z is between 0.75 and 1. The expansion converges for |z| ≤1, so it's on the boundary. Not sure if useful.\n\nAlternatively, use the integral representation again: arctan(z) = ∫₀^1 z/(1 + z² t²) dt. Then the integral becomes:\n\nI = ∫₀^{π/2} [ ∫₀^1 (7/8 + (1/8) cos4x)/(1 + (7/8",
