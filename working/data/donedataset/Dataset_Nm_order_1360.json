    "Content": "How could we prove that $$\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{J_{2a}(2x)~J_{2b}(2x)}{x^{2n+1}}~dx~=~\\frac12\\cdot\\frac{(a+b-n-1)!~(2n)!}{(n+a+b)!~(n+a-b)!~(n-a+b)!}$$ for $a+b>n>-\\dfrac12$ ? Inspired by this question , I sought to find $($a justification for$)$ the closed form expressions of the following two integrals: $~\\displaystyle\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{J_A(x)}{x^N}~dx~$ and $~\\displaystyle\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{J_A(x)~J_B(x)}{x^N}~dx.~$ For the former, we have $~\\displaystyle\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{J_{2k+1}(2x)}{x^{2n}}~dx~=~\\frac12\\cdot\\frac{(k-n)!}{(k+n)!}~,~$ for $k>n>\\dfrac14~,~$ which I was ultimately able to “justify” $($sort of$)$ in a highly unorthodox manner, using a certain trigonometric integral expression for the Bessel function , and then carelessly $($and shamelessly$)$ exchanging the order of integration. Unfortunately, even such underhanded tricks have failed me when attempting to approach the latter. Can anybody here help me ? Thank you !",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. So the user wants to prove this integral involving Bessel functions. Let me start by understanding the components.\n\nFirst, the integral given is from 0 to infinity of [J_{2a}(2x) * J_{2b}(2x)] divided by x^(2n+1) dx, and it's supposed to equal that factorial expression divided by 2. The conditions are a + b > n > -1/2. \n\nLooking at the original question, the user mentions they were inspired by another question and tried to find a closed form for integrals involving J_A(x)/x^N and J_A(x)J_B(x)/x^N. They had some success with the first integral using a trigonometric integral expression and swapping integration order, but the second one is problematic.\n\nSo, the problem here is specifically about the integral of the product of two Bessel functions divided by x raised to some power. The assumptions would include the conditions on the parameters a, b, n. Let's parse the problem statement again.\n\nThe user states the integral equals the given expression for a + b > n > -1/2. So the assumptions need to list the conditions on each parameter. Each assumption should be a single condition applied to one object. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The variables a, b, n satisfy a + b > n.\n2. The variable n is greater than -1/2.\n3. The integral is over x from 0 to infinity.\n4. The integrand involves Bessel functions J_{2a}(2x) and J_{2b}(2x) divided by x^(2n+1).\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the integral is specifically given with those Bessel functions and the denominator. The parameters have constraints a + b > n > -1/2. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- a, b, n are real numbers such that a + b > n.\n- n is a real number such that n > -1/2.\n- The integral is taken over x from 0 to infinity.\n- The integrand is [J_{2a}(2x) * J_{2b}(2x)] / x^{2n+1}.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to prove the equality given those conditions. The original question might have more context, but the user has already filtered out the example. So in the example provided earlier, the assumptions were about the variables (n is integer, n divisible by 7). Here, the key conditions are the inequalities on a, b, n. Also, since the Bessel functions have indices 2a and 2b, maybe a and b are such that 2a and 2b are valid orders for Bessel functions, which typically require the order to be a real number (but maybe that's too basic to include). However, the problem states the result for a + b > n > -1/2, so probably the main assumptions are those inequalities.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n- a + b > n\n- n > -1/2\n\nEach of these is a separate condition applied to the variables. The problem then is to prove the integral equals the given expression. So structuring this:\n\nAssumption:\na + b > n,\nn > -1/2.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{J_{2a}(2x)~J_{2b}(2x)}{x^{2n+1}}~dx~=~\\frac12\\cdot\\frac{(a+b-n-1)!~(2n)!}{(n+a+b)!~(n+a-b)!~(n-a+b)!}$$\n\nBut wait, in the example, the user included the assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. In the current problem, the original question mentions that in the first integral, k > n > 1/4, but in the problem statement here, it's a + b > n > -1/2. So perhaps the conditions here are a + b > n and n > -1/2. The variables a, b, n are probably real numbers? Or integers? The original integral result has factorials, which usually imply integers, but the problem mentions a + b > n > -1/2, which suggests n could be a real number. However, factorials are generalized using gamma functions for non-integer arguments, so maybe the factorial symbols here are representing gamma functions. The user might be using factorial notation for gamma functions, which is common in some contexts. So the assumptions are that a, b, n satisfy a + b > n and n > -1/2. Therefore, each of these is an assumption line.",
