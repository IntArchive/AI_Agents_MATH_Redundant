    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The problem states that we have two n×n real matrices A and B such that AB = BA = 0, and A + B is invertible. We need to prove three things: rank A + rank B = n, nullity A + nullity B = n, and that A - B is invertible.\n\nFirst, I remember that when matrices commute and satisfy certain conditions, some rank-nullity theorems might apply. Since AB = BA = 0, this means that the image of one matrix is contained in the kernel of the other. Specifically, Im(A) ⊆ Ker(B) and Im(B) ⊆ Ker(A). Because applying B after A (or A after B) results in the zero matrix.\n\nNow, the rank-nullity theorem says that for any matrix, rank + nullity = n. So, for matrix A, rank A + nullity A = n, and similarly for matrix B, rank B + nullity B = n. But the problem asks us to show that rank A + rank B = n and nullity A + nullity B = n. That seems connected. Maybe combining the two rank-nullity equations?\n\nLet me write down the equations:\n\nFor A: rank A + nullity A = n\n\nFor B: rank B + nullity B = n\n\nIf we add them together: (rank A + rank B) + (nullity A + nullity B) = 2n\n\nBut the problem wants us to show that rank A + rank B = n and nullity A + nullity B = n. So adding those two gives 2n, which matches the sum from rank-nullity. Therefore, if we can prove one of the statements, the other follows directly. So maybe focus on proving one first.\n\nGiven that A + B is invertible, that means that A + B has full rank n. Also, since AB = BA = 0, we might be able to use properties of commuting matrices. Wait, but usually commuting matrices can be simultaneously triangularized, but here they not only commute but also annihilate each other. Hmm.\n\nAnother thought: if A and B are such that AB = BA = 0, then they are simultaneously diagonalizable? Not necessarily, but maybe they can be decomposed in some way. Alternatively, considering that since A + B is invertible, then det(A + B) ≠ 0. But I'm not sure if determinant properties will help here directly.\n\nAlternatively, consider the ranks. Since Im(A) ⊆ Ker(B), then rank A ≤ nullity B. Similarly, rank B ≤ nullity A. From rank-nullity theorem for B: nullity B = n - rank B. So substituting into the first inequality: rank A ≤ n - rank B. Therefore, rank A + rank B ≤ n. Similarly, rank B ≤ nullity A = n - rank A, so rank B + rank A ≤ n. So together, we have rank A + rank B ≤ n.\n\nBut we need to show equality. How does the invertibility of A + B come into play here? Maybe since A + B is invertible, its rank is n. So, rank(A + B) = n. But rank(A + B) ≤ rank A + rank B (since the rank of a sum is less than or equal to the sum of the ranks). So, n ≤ rank A + rank B. But earlier we had rank A + rank B ≤ n, so combining these gives rank A + rank B = n. That's the first result.\n\nSo the key step was using the fact that rank(A + B) ≤ rank A + rank B and that rank(A + B) = n because it's invertible. Then, the earlier inequality from the rank-nullity gives the equality. Therefore, rank A + rank B = n.\n\nThen, for the nullities: nullity A + nullity B = (n - rank A) + (n - rank B) = 2n - (rank A + rank B) = 2n - n = n. So that's the second result.\n\nFor the third part, proving that A - B is invertible. Since A + B is invertible, maybe we can relate A - B to A + B somehow. Let's think about (A - B)(A + B). Expanding that gives A^2 + AB - BA - B^2. But AB = BA = 0, so this simplifies to A^2 - B^2. However, this doesn't immediately help. Alternatively, maybe square (A - B) or consider another combination.\n\nAlternatively, since A + B is invertible, and we have AB = 0, BA = 0, perhaps we can find an inverse for A - B. Let's suppose that the inverse of A + B is some matrix C. Then, (A + B)C = I. Maybe we can use that to construct an inverse for A - B. Let me try multiplying A - B by A + B. Wait, we already saw that gives A^2 - B^2. But AB = BA = 0, so A^2 = A(A + B) since AB = 0. Similarly, B^2 = B(A + B). But I don't see the connection yet.\n\nAnother approach: Since A and B are such that AB = BA = 0, then A and B are simultaneously diagonalizable? Or maybe in some block form. Suppose we consider that since A + B is invertible, and they annihilate each other, perhaps A and B are complementary in some sense. For example, if A is a projection matrix, then B would be the complementary projection, but since AB = 0, they project onto orthogonal subspaces. However, they are not necessarily projections, but the idea might hold.\n\nAlternatively, consider that since rank A + rank B = n, and Im(A) and Im(B) are subspaces of dimensions rank A and rank B, respectively. Since their sum is n, and their intersection might be trivial? Wait, if Im(A) is contained in Ker(B) and vice versa, then the images might intersect trivially. Because if a vector is in Im(A), then B maps it to zero, and vice versa. So, if Im(A) and Im(B) only intersect at zero, then the sum Im(A) + Im(B) is a direct sum, and of dimension rank A + rank B = n. Hence, the entire space is the direct sum of Im(A) and Im(B). Similarly, the kernels might have a similar decomposition.\n\nBut how does this relate to A - B being invertible? Suppose that if we take a vector v, and suppose (A - B)v = 0. Then Av = Bv. Let's see if this implies v = 0. Since A and B annihilate each other, let's apply A to both sides: A(Av) = A(Bv) = 0, so A^2 v = 0. Similarly, apply B to both sides: B(Av) = 0 = B^2 v. So, A^2 v = B^2 v = 0. But we know that A + B is invertible. Maybe we can write v = (A + B)^{-1}(A + B)v. But not sure. Alternatively, since Av = Bv, then (A + B)v = Av + Bv = Av + Av = 2Av. But (A + B) is invertible, so if (A + B)v = 2Av, then v = (A + B)^{-1}(2Av). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that (A - B)v = 0 implies Av = Bv. Then, since AB = 0, multiplying both sides by A gives A^2 v = A B v = 0. Similarly, multiplying by B gives B A v = B^2 v = 0. So A^2 v = B^2 v = 0. Now, consider (A + B)v = Av + Bv = 2Av (since Av = Bv). But (A + B)v = 2Av. Since A + B is invertible, if v ≠ 0, then (A + B)v ≠ 0, so 2Av ≠ 0. But A^2 v = 0 implies that A(Av) = 0, so Av is in the kernel of A. Similarly, Av = Bv, so Av is in the image of B. But earlier, we have that Im(B) is contained in Ker(A), so Bv is in Ker(A). Hence, Av = Bv implies Av is in Ker(A). Therefore, A(Av) = 0, which is already known. But Av is in both Im(A) and Ker(A). The only vector that is in both is the zero vector. Therefore, Av = 0. Similarly, Bv = Av = 0. Hence, (A + B)v = 0 + 0 = 0. But since A + B is invertible, this implies v = 0. Therefore, the kernel of A - B is trivial, so A - B is invertible.\n\nTherefore, the key steps are:\n\n1. Use the rank-nullity theorem and the given conditions to show rank A + rank B = n.\n\n2. The nullities then sum to n as a consequence.\n\n3. For the invertibility of A - B, assume there's a non-trivial kernel and derive a contradiction using the invertibility of A + B and the properties of A and B annihilating each other.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the problem is structured with the given assumptions, and each part of the problem follows from these assumptions.",
