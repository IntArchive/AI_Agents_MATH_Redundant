    "Content": "I am interested in finding a general formula for the following integral:\n$$\\int_0^\\infty J_\\nu(x)^3dx,\\tag1$$\nwhere $J_\\nu(x)$ is the Bessel function of the first kind :\n$$J_\\nu(x)=\\sum _{n=0}^\\infty\\frac{(-1)^n}{\\Gamma(n+1)\\Gamma(n+\\nu+1)}\\left(\\frac x2\\right)^{2n+\\nu}.\\tag2$$ Mathematica gives the following result:\n$$\\int_0^\\infty J_\\nu(x)^3dx=\\frac1{\\pi\\,\\nu}{_3F_2}\\left(\\frac12,\\frac12-\\nu,\\frac12+\\nu;1-\\frac\\nu2,1+\\frac\\nu2;\\frac14\\right)+\\frac{\\Gamma\\left(-\\frac\\nu2\\right)\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{1+3\\nu}2\\right)\\cos\\frac{\\pi\\,\\nu}2}{2^{\\nu+1}\\ \\pi^{3/2}\\ \\Gamma(\\nu+1)}{_3F_2}\\left(\\frac{1-\\nu}2,\\frac{1+\\nu}2,\\frac{1+3\\nu}2;1+\\frac\\nu2,1+\\nu;\\frac14\\right),\\tag3$$\nwhich can be significantly simplified for odd and half-integer values of $\\nu$. The results at those points allow to conjecture another, simpler general formula:\n$$\\int_0^\\infty J_\\nu(x)^3dx\\stackrel?=\\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac16\\right)\\ \\Gamma\\left(\\frac16+\\frac\\nu2\\right)}{2^{5/3}\\ 3^{1/2}\\ \\pi^{3/2}\\ \\Gamma\\left(\\frac56+\\frac\\nu2\\right)},\\tag4$$\nwhich agrees with $(3)$ to a very high precision for many different values of $\\nu$. It also has an advantage that it is defined for all $\\nu>-\\frac13$ whereas $(3)$ is undefined at every even $\\nu$ and requires calculating a limit at those points. Is it possible to prove the formula $(4)$? Mathematica is able to evaluate $(1)$ for even values of $\\nu$ in terms of the Meijer G-function . Plugging those expressions into $(4)$ we get another form of the conjecture:\n$$G_{3,3}^{2,1}\\left(\\frac14\\left|\\begin{array}{c}2a,1,2-2a\\\\\\frac12,1-a,a\\\\\\end{array}\n\\right.\\right)\\stackrel?=\\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac16\\right)\\ \\Gamma\\left(\\frac23-a\\right)}{2^{5/3}\\ 3^{1/2}\\ \\pi\\ \\Gamma\\left(\\frac43-a\\right)}.\\tag5$$\nIncidentally, the case $a=\\frac12$ would positively resolve my another question .",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Thank you for posting this question, I enjoyed trying to answer it. Start with the expression that Mathematica gave you and replace each\nargument $\\frac14$ of a hypergeometric function with $\\frac z4$,\nbecause we will be taking limits. I will call the two hypergeometric\nfunctions $Q_1(z)$ and $Q_2(z)$. Each term can be brought to a closed\nform by using identity 16.6.2 from the DLMF . Setting $a=\\frac12$, $b=1-\\frac\\nu2$, we get\n$$ Q_1(z) = (1-z)^{-\\frac12} F\\left(\\frac16,\n\\frac36,\\frac 56; 1-\\frac\\nu2, 1+\\frac\\nu2; \\frac{-27 z}{4(1-z)^3}\n\\right), $$\nand setting $a=\\frac{1+3\\nu}{2}$, $b=1+\\frac\\nu2$, we get\n$$ Q_2(z) = (1-z)^{-\\frac{1+3\\nu}{2}} F\\left(\\frac{1+3\\nu}6,\n\\frac{3+3\\nu}{6}, \\frac{5+3\\nu}{6}; 1+\\frac\\nu2, 1+\\nu;\n\\frac{-27z}{4(1-z)^3} \\right). $$\n(Note that there are 6 possible identities to try per function, one for each possible choice of\n$a$ and $b$ from the parameters, so it helps to do this on a\ncomputer.) The reason this works is that now the point $z=1$ is a singular point\nof the hypergeometric functions on the right hand side, and Mathematica\nwill succeed in finding the limits as $z\\to1$. The expression for the\nwhole integral that you have is\n$$ Q =\n\\frac{2^{\\frac43}\\pi^{\\frac12}}{\\Gamma(-\\frac16)\\Gamma(\\frac56+\\frac\\nu2)\\Gamma(\\frac56-\\frac\\nu2)\\sin\\frac{\\nu\\pi}2}\n\\left( -1 + 3^{-\\frac{3\\nu}2}\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\nu\\pi}{2}\\right)\n\\frac{\\Gamma(\\frac{1+3\\nu}{2})\n\\Gamma(\\frac56-\\frac\\nu2)}{\\Gamma(\\frac{1+\\nu}2)\\Gamma(\\frac56+\\frac\\nu2)}\n\\right). $$\nCall the large expression in brackets $A$, and then write\n$$ A = -1 + B 3^{-\\frac{3\\nu}{2}}\\cos\\frac{\\pi\\nu}{2}, \\qquad B = \\frac{\\Gamma(\\frac{1+3\\nu}{2})\n\\Gamma(\\frac56-\\frac\\nu2)}{\\Gamma(\\frac{1+\\nu}2)\\Gamma(\\frac56+\\frac\\nu2)}. $$ Now, Mathematica will not simplify $A$ or $B$ on its own, so it needs\nhelp. Set $x=\\frac16+\\frac\\nu2$, and use the multiplication formula to\nget\n$$\n\\frac{\\Gamma(\\frac{1+3\\nu}2)}{\\Gamma(\\frac{1+\\nu}{2})\\Gamma(\\frac56+\\frac\\nu2)}\n= \\frac{\\Gamma(3x)}{\\Gamma(x+\\frac13)\\Gamma(x+\\frac23)} =\n\\frac{\\Gamma(x)}{2\\pi} 3^{3x-1/2}. $$\nAfter this, $A$ simplifies to\n$$ A = -1 +\n\\frac{\\Gamma(\\frac16+\\frac\\nu2)\\Gamma(\\frac56-\\frac\\nu2)}{2\\pi}\\cos\\frac{\\pi\\nu}{2}\n= -1 + \\frac{\\cos\\frac{\\pi\\nu}{2}}{2\\sin(\\frac\\pi6+\\frac{\\pi\\nu}{2})},\n$$\nwhere I've also used the reflection formula for $\\Gamma(z)\\Gamma(1-z)$ to get rid of the\ngamma functions. Some further amount of manual trigonometry yields\n$$ A = -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\frac{\\sin\\frac{\\pi\\nu}{2}}{\\sin(\\frac\\pi6 +\n\\frac{\\nu\\pi}{2})}. $$ Finally, write\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\sin(\\frac\\pi6+\\frac{\\pi\\nu}{2})} =\n\\frac{\\Gamma(\\frac16+\\frac\\nu2)\\Gamma(\\frac56-\\frac\\nu2)}{\\pi}, $$\nand substitute back. Lots of things cancel, and the answer is\n$$ Q = -\\frac{3^{1/2}2^{1/3}}{\\pi^{1/2}}\n\\frac{\\Gamma(\\frac16+\\frac\\nu2)}{\\Gamma(-\\frac16)\\Gamma(\\frac56+\\frac\\nu2)}. $$ This closed form is equivalent to the one you gave through the\nuse of $\\Gamma(\\frac16)\\Gamma(-\\frac16)=-12\\pi$. P.S. I would also like to note that the integral\n$$ I(\\nu,c) = \\int_0^\\infty J_\\nu(x)^2 J_\\nu(c x)\\,dx $$\nand its general form\n$$ \\int_0^\\infty x^{\\rho-1}J_\\nu(a x) J_\\mu(b x) J_\\lambda(c x)\\,dx $$\nappear in Gradshteyn and Ryzhik, and you can find a paper \"Some\ninfinite integrals involving bessel functions, I and II\" by\nW. N. Bailey, which evaluates this integral in terms of Appell\nfunctions, but only in the case $c>2$ ($|c|>|a|+|b|$), which is where the $F_4$ Appell\nfunction converges. DLMF 16.16.6 actually gives a way to write this\nintegral as\n$$\n\\frac{\\Gamma(\\frac{1+3\\nu}{2})c^{-1-2\\nu}}{\\Gamma(1+\\nu)^2\\Gamma(\\frac{1-\\nu}{2})}\n\\,\\,\\,{}_2F_1\\left( \\frac{1+\\nu}{2}, \\frac{1+3\\nu}{2}; 1+\\nu; x\n\\right)^2, \\qquad x = \\frac{1-\\sqrt{1-4/c^2}}{2}, $$\nbut the issue is that this is only correct for $c>2$, and the rhs is\ncomplex for $c<2$. Appell function would only be defined by analytic\ncontinuation in this case anyway, and I didn't find anything useful about\nnon-principal branches of Appell or hypergeometric functions. For $c>2$, Mathematica also gives the following:\n$$\nI(\\nu,c) = \\frac{\\Gamma(\\frac{1+3\\nu}{2})c^{-1-2\\nu}}{\\Gamma(\\frac{1-\\nu}{2})\\Gamma(1+\\nu)^2}\n\\,\\,\\,{}_3F_2\\left( \\frac{1+\\nu}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}+\\nu,\n\\frac{1+3\\nu}{2}; 1+\\nu, 1+2\\nu; \\frac{4}{c^2} \\right), $$\nbut this is incorrect when $c<2$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this problem. The user is asking about proving a conjectured formula for the integral of the cube of the Bessel function of the first kind from zero to infinity. The original problem has a lot of details, including the Mathematica result and alternative forms involving hypergeometric functions and Meijer G-functions. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the main assumptions and the core problem. The user mentions that the integral is of interest for a general formula, and they have a conjecture that simplifies significantly for odd and half-integer ν. The conjectured formula is given in equation (4). \n\nAssumptions would include the properties of the Bessel function J_ν(x), the domain of integration (0 to infinity), and perhaps the conditions on ν where the conjecture is supposed to hold, like ν > -1/3 as mentioned. However, the problem statement doesn't specify if there are any restrictions on ν beyond what's in equation (4). The user also mentions that the conjectured formula is defined for all ν > -1/3, whereas the original Mathematica result has issues at even ν. So, the assumption here is that ν is greater than -1/3. Also, since they are dealing with integrals of Bessel functions, maybe the convergence of the integral is an implicit assumption, but since the problem is to prove the formula, perhaps that's part of what needs to be addressed. However, the user's main request is to prove equation (4), so the assumptions would be the conditions under which this formula is conjectured to hold.\n\nLooking at the example given, each assumption is a single condition on a single object. So for this problem:\n\nAssumption: ν is a real number such that ν > -1/3.\n\nProblem: Prove that ∫₀^∞ [J_ν(x)]³ dx equals [Γ(1/6) Γ(1/6 + ν/2)] / [2^(5/3) 3^(1/2) π^(3/2) Γ(5/6 + ν/2)].\n\nI need to check if there are other assumptions. The problem mentions that the conjecture is for all ν > -1/3, so that's the main condition. The Bessel function J_ν(x) is defined here, but perhaps its standard properties are assumed, like being a Bessel function of the first kind. Since the user provided the series definition for J_ν(x), maybe that's part of the problem setup, but in the example given, the assumptions were about the variables in the problem statement (n being integer, etc.), not about mathematical objects like functions unless specified. So in this case, the key assumption is the domain of ν. The integral is from 0 to infinity, which is given, so that's part of the problem statement, not an assumption.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have the assumption on ν and the problem statement as proving the integral equals the gamma function expression.",
