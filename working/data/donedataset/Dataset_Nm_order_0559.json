    "Content": "How do you prove $n \\choose k$ is maximum when $k$ is $\\lceil n/2 \\rceil$ or $\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$ ? This link provides a proof of sorts but it is not satisfying. From what I understand, it focuses on product pairings present in $k! (n-k)!$ term which are of the form $i \\times (i-1)$ . Since these are minimized when $i=n/2$ , we get the result. But what about the reasoning for the rest of the terms?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I have done this proof in Metamath before; it may help to see the whole thing laid out. The proof follows from the fact that the binomial coefficient is monotone in the second argument, i.e. ${n\\choose k'}\\le{n\\choose k''}$ when $0\\le k'\\le k''\\le\\lceil\\frac n2\\rceil$, which can be proven by induction. Given this, you just set $k''=\\lceil\\frac n2\\rceil$ and $k'=k$ or $k'=n-k$ depending on whether $k\\le\\frac n2$, and you get ${n\\choose k}={n\\choose n-k}\\le{n\\choose \\lceil n/2\\rceil}={n\\choose \\lfloor n/2\\rfloor}$ (where the equalities are deduced by symmetry of the binomial coefficient under $k\\mapsto n-k$). To prove monotonicity, we prove ${n\\choose k-1}\\le{n\\choose k}$ for $1\\le k\\le\\lceil\\frac n2\\rceil$, and thus ${n\\choose k}\\le{n\\choose k+1}\\le\\dots\\le{n\\choose l}$ for any $k\\le l$ in the range. Now we have: $${n\\choose k-1}=\\frac{n!}{(k-1)!(n-k+1)!}=\\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\\frac{k}{n-k+1}={n\\choose k}\\frac{k}{n-k+1},$$ so ${n\\choose k-1}\\le{n\\choose k}$ iff $\\frac{k}{n-k+1}\\le 1$. But that is equivalent to $$k\\le n-k+1\\iff 2k\\le n+1\\iff k\\le \\frac{n+1}2\\iff k\\le \\left\\lceil\\frac{n}2\\right\\rceil,$$ and we are done.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format a problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified structure. The example given includes listing assumptions line by line and then stating the problem. \n\nLooking at the example, the original problem had an assumption about n being an integer and divisible by 7, but in the formatted problem, only the divisibility by 7 was listed as an assumption. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the original problem was edited? Because in the example, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Hmm, maybe the example had a mistake, but I need to follow the user's instruction regardless.\n\nBut moving on to the current problem. The question is about proving that the binomial coefficient n choose k is maximum when k is floor(n/2) or ceil(n/2). The original question mentions the link providing a proof but the user isn't satisfied. The user is asking for a reasoning that covers the rest of the terms beyond the product pairings.\n\nSo, first, I need to structure this problem into the Assumption and Problem sections as per the format. But what are the assumptions here? The original problem doesn't state any specific conditions beyond the general case. The binomial coefficient n choose k is defined for integers n and k with 0 ≤ k ≤ n. The problem is about showing that the maximum occurs at k = floor(n/2) or ceil(n/2). So, the assumptions would be that n is a non-negative integer, k is an integer between 0 and n inclusive. But wait, in the example, the assumptions were specific properties. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like maybe the example was a different problem. Maybe the original problem had n being an integer, but the formatted version added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. But that's confusing. Wait, looking back: the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, this seems contradictory. Unless there was a miscommunication in the example. Perhaps the user intended to show that even if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem might have an assumption where n is divisible by 7. Maybe the example was a mistake, but regardless, I need to focus on the current problem.\n\nFor the current problem: \"How do you prove that n choose k is maximum when k is ceil(n/2) or floor(n/2)?\" The assumptions here are that n is a non-negative integer, k is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n. But since the problem is general, maybe there are no additional assumptions beyond the standard definition of binomial coefficients. The problem is asking for a proof of the maximum occurring at those k values.\n\nIn the example, the assumptions were listed as two separate lines: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. So perhaps for this problem, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a non-negative integer,\nk is an integer,\n0 ≤ k ≤ n.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the binomial coefficient ${n \\choose k}$ is maximum when $k$ is $\\lceil \\tfrac{n}{2} \\rceil$ or $\\lfloor \\tfrac{n}{2} \\rfloor$.\n\nBut wait, the original question's title is \"How do you prove ${n \\choose k}$ is maximum when $k$ is $ \\lceil \\tfrac n2 \\rceil$ or $ \\lfloor \\tfrac n2\\rfloor $?\" So the problem is exactly that. The assumptions would be the standard conditions for the binomial coefficient, which are n and k are integers with 0 ≤ k ≤ n.\n\nSo, the formatted problem should have assumptions that n is a non-negative integer, k is an integer between 0 and n inclusive. Each assumption is a separate line. Then the problem is to prove the maximum occurs at those k values.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. Let me structure it accordingly.",
