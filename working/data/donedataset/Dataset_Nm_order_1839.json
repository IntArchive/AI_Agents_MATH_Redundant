    "Content": "Possible Duplicate: Proving that an ideal in a PID is maximal if and only if it is generated by an irreducible I am trying to see whether the ideal generated by irreducible element in a principal ideal domain (PID) is maximal ideal. Suppose r is irreducible in a PID say D Let I be an ideal of D containing ( r ) the ideal generated by r Since D is a principal ideal domain, there exist s in D such that I =( s ), therefore ( r ) is a subset of ( s ). So, r = st , for some t in D but r is irreducible, this implies that s or t is a unit. If s is a unit then I = ( s )= D . If t is a unit then ( r )= I =( s ). But I am not sure this is true, because I do not have reason for saying ( r )= I =( s ), so that I can conclude and say ( r ) is maximal. I need a little help for this. Thanks",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "In fact, we can generalize a bit. Proposition: If $R$ is an integral domain and $x\\in R\\setminus \\{0\\}$ , then $x$ is irreducible if and only if $xR$ is maximal amongst all principal proper ideals of $R$ (ie if $I=yR \\subsetneq R$ and $xR\\subseteq yR$ then $xR=yR$ ). Proof: ( $\\Rightarrow$ )  Suppose $x$ is irreducible and choose $y\\in R$ with $xR\\subseteq yR\\subsetneq R$ .  Then, for some $r\\in R$ , $x=yr$ .  Since $x$ is irreducible, either $y\\in U(R)$ or $r\\in U(R)$ .  However, the fact that $yR\\neq R$ implies that $y\\notin U(R)$ , hence $r\\in U(R)$ , $y=r^{-1}x$ , and it easily follows that $xR=yR$ .  Hence, $xR$ is maximal amongst proper principal ideals of $R$ . ( $\\Leftarrow$ )  Suppose that $xR$ is maximal amongst all principal proper ideals of $R$ , and assume that $x=yz$ for nonzero nonunits $y,z\\in R$ .  Then, since neither $y$ nor $z$ are units, it is clear that $xR=yzR\\subsetneq yR\\subsetneq R$ .  This contradicts the maximality of $xR$ amongst proper principal ideals of $R$ .  Therefore $x$ is irreducible. $\\blacksquare$ Now, if $R$ is a PID, then the above proposition implies that for all irredicuble $x\\in R$ , $xR$ is a maximal ideal.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. First, I need to read the original question carefully and identify all the assumptions and the main problem.\n\nThe title asks if the ideal generated by an irreducible element in a principal ideal domain (PID) is maximal. The question body starts by stating that the user is trying to verify this claim. They mention that r is irreducible in a PID, D. Then, they consider an ideal I containing (r). Since D is a PID, I is generated by some element s, so (r) is a subset of (s). This leads to r = st, and because r is irreducible, either s or t must be a unit. If s is a unit, then I = D. If t is a unit, then (r) = (s), which would imply that I = (r), but the user is unsure about this step and needs help concluding that (r) is maximal.\n\nSo, the key assumptions here are:\n\n1. D is a principal ideal domain (PID). That's a given condition about the structure of the ring.\n2. r is an irreducible element in D. The problem focuses on the ideal generated by such an element.\n3. The user considers an ideal I that contains (r). Since D is a PID, I must be generated by some element s, leading to (r) ⊆ (s).\n4. From r = st, the irreducibility of r implies that either s or t is a unit.\n\nThe problem then is to prove whether the ideal (r) is maximal in D. The user's confusion is about the case when t is a unit, leading to (r) = (s), which would mean there are no ideals between (r) and D, hence maximal.\n\nWait, but in the original problem statement, the user is asking if (r) is maximal, given that r is irreducible in a PID. The assumptions should list all the given conditions. So:\n\nAssumptions would include:\n- D is a principal ideal domain.\n- r is an irreducible element in D.\n- I is an ideal of D such that (r) ⊆ I ⊆ D.\n- I is generated by some element s (since D is a PID).\n- From r ∈ (s), r = st for some t in D.\n- Because r is irreducible, either s or t is a unit.\n\nBut the problem is to show that (r) is a maximal ideal. However, in the problem statement, the user is working through the proof and is stuck on whether (r) = (s) when t is a unit. The core problem is to prove that the ideal generated by an irreducible element in a PID is maximal.\n\nBut according to the example given, the assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. So breaking down:\n\nAssumption:\nD is a principal ideal domain,\nr is an element in D,\nr is irreducible,\nI is an ideal of D,\n(r) is a subset of I,\nI is generated by an element s in D,\nr = st for some t in D,\nif t is a unit, then (r) = (s).\n\nWait, but maybe some of these are part of the problem's setup rather than assumptions. The key given conditions are that D is a PID and r is irreducible. The rest are steps in the proof attempt.\n\nSo, the problem's actual assumptions are:\n\n- D is a principal ideal domain.\n- r is an irreducible element in D.\n\nThe problem is to prove that the ideal (r) is maximal in D.\n\nBut in the original question, the user is going through their own reasoning and gets stuck. The formatted problem should capture the essential question, filtering out the user's proof attempt details. The core problem is: Is the ideal generated by an irreducible element in a PID maximal?\n\nTherefore, the structured problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nD is a principal ideal domain,\nr is an irreducible element in D.\nProblem:\nProve that the ideal (r) is maximal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to show that in a PID, irreducible elements generate maximal ideals. The original question's title is: \"Is the ideal generated by irreducible element in principal ideal domain maximal?\" So the problem is to determine whether (r) is maximal, given D is a PID and r is irreducible.\n\nSo, the formatted problem should list the assumptions as D is a PID and r is irreducible, and the problem is to prove (r) is maximal.\n\nI think that's the correct structure. The user's own steps (like considering I = (s) containing (r)) are part of their approach, but the essential problem is as above.",
