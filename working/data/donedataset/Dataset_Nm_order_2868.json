    "Content": "I want to solve the following exercise. Let $G$ be a finite group, with exactly one element $f$ of order $2$.\n  Prove that $\\prod_{g\\in G} g = f$. I have a question regarding the notation, the expression $\\prod_{g\\in G} g$ stands for the product over all elements of $G$? But then it is not well-defined for non-abelian group, cause the order in which this product is evaluated matters? Or for what else can $\\prod_{g\\in G} g$ stand? EDIT: \nI have taken the exercise from an algebra book, and I just looked up the homepage of the author and found an errata. And indeed, the exercise is wrongly stated! The group must be assumed to be abelian. http://www.math.fsu.edu/~aluffi/algebraerrata/Errata.html",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The statement is wrong, not well-defined, and in fact one should assume that $G$ is abelian. Then the proof is easy by using the equivalence relation $x \\sim y \\Leftrightarrow x=y \\vee x=y^{-1}$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem from Math Stack Exchange. The user is concerned about the notation ∏_{g∈G} g for a finite group G not being well-defined, especially in non-abelian groups because the product's result might depend on the order of multiplication. The original exercise states that if G is a finite group with exactly one element f of order 2, then the product of all elements in G is f. But the user points out that the problem was erroneously stated and requires G to be abelian, as per the author's errata.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the problem correctly. The key points here are:\n\n1. The group G is finite.\n2. G has exactly one element f of order 2.\n3. The product of all elements in G (denoted ∏_{g∈G} g) equals f.\n4. The original problem didn't specify G as abelian, leading to ambiguity in the product's definition since non-abelian groups have non-commutative operations.\n\nThe user's main issue is the notation ∏_{g∈G} g not being well-defined for non-abelian groups. However, the errata clarifies that G must be abelian. So, when structuring the problem, the assumption that G is abelian needs to be included to make the product well-defined (since in abelian groups, the product's result is independent of the order of multiplication).\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should list that G is a finite group, G is abelian, and there's exactly one element f of order 2 in G. Each of these is a separate condition applied to G or f. The problem then is to prove that the product of all elements in G equals f.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, was the abelian condition included? The user mentions that the exercise was wrongly stated and the author's errata adds the abelian condition. So the corrected problem assumes G is abelian. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumptions should include G is finite, G is abelian, and there's exactly one element f of order 2. Each of these as separate lines.\n\nSo the structured problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a finite group,\nG is abelian,\nG has exactly one element f of order 2.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ∏_{g∈G} g = f.\n\nI need to ensure that each assumption is a single condition per line. The original problem didn't have the abelian condition, but the errata adds it, so that's crucial for the problem's validity. The key here is that without the abelian assumption, the product isn't well-defined, but with it, the problem makes sense.",
