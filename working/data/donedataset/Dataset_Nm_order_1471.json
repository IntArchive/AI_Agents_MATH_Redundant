    "Content": "If $p$ is prime, then $(x+y)^p=x^p+y^p$ holds in any field of characteristic $p$ . However all the proofs I have seen use induction and some relatively nasty algebra despite how fundamental this fact seems. What is the nicest, \"highest level proof\" you know?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $F$ be a field of characteristic $p$. Let $f = (1 + x)^p \\in F[x]$. We want to show that $f = 1 + x^p$. Take the formal derivative: $f' = p(x+1)^{p-1} = 0$ Now we know that $f$ has degree $p$, and its derivative is $0$, so $f$ must be in the form $A + Bx^p$ with $A$, $B \\in F$. $f(0) = 1$ so $A = 1$. A product of monic polynomials is always monic so $B = 1$. Q.E.D. The \"freshman's dream\" is a corollary of this fact. The fact that the binomial coefficient $\\binom p  i$ is divisible by $p$ for $1 \\leq i \\leq p-1$ is also a corollary. The binomial theorem itself can be proved by taking derivatives of $(1 + x)^n$. Fermat's little theorem follows easily: $\\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n 1 \\right)^p = \\sum_{r=1}^n (1^p) = \\sum_{r=1}^n 1$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to format this Math Stack Exchange question according to the user's guidelines. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions in the problem. The original question is about proving that in a field of characteristic p (where p is prime), the equation (x + y)^p = x^p + y^p holds. The user mentions that existing proofs use induction and algebra, but they want a higher-level proof.\n\nLooking at the assumptions: The problem states that p is a prime. Then, the field in question has characteristic p. These are two separate conditions. The first applies to p (being prime), and the second applies to the field (its characteristic is p). So each of these should be a separate assumption line.\n\nNext, the problem statement itself is to prove that (x + y)^p equals x^p + y^p in such a field. \n\nWait, the original problem didn't specify that p is prime and the field has characteristic p in the problem statement, but the title refers to \"a freshman's dream\" which is a known result in fields of characteristic p. The question also starts with \"If p is prime, then...\" So the assumptions here are that p is prime and the field has characteristic p. \n\nSo breaking it down:\n\nAssumption 1: p is a prime.\nAssumption 2: The field has characteristic p.\n\nProblem: Prove that (x + y)^p = x^p + y^p holds in the field.\n\nI should check if there are more assumptions, but the problem doesn't mention anything else. The user is asking for a proof using higher-level methods instead of induction and messy algebra. However, the formatting example provided by the user only requires listing the assumptions and the problem statement, not the actual proof. So my job here is just to structure the problem as per the format.\n\nThe example given by the user had an original problem where the assumption about divisibility by 7 was not in the original problem but was added. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, an assumption that n is divisible by 7 was added. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That might be an error. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake there. But in the current problem, the assumptions are correctly extracted from the problem statement. The original problem says \"if p is prime, then (x + y)^p = x^p + y^p holds in any field of characteristic p\". So the assumptions are p is prime and the field has characteristic p.\n\nSo the formatted problem should list those two assumptions, each on their own line. Then the problem is to prove the equality.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \np is a prime,\nthe field has characteristic p.\nProblem:\nProve that $(x + y)^p = x^p + y^p$ holds in the field.\n###\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is on a separate line and addresses only one property. The first assumption is about p being prime. The second is about the field's characteristic. That fits. The problem statement is straightforward. The original question might have had some extra text, like the mention of induction and algebra, but those are part of the user's query, not the problem's assumptions. So filtering out unrelated information, the core problem is as above.",
