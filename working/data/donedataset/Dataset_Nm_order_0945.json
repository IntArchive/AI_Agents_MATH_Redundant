    "Content": "I have stumbled upon the following integral: $$I=\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\ln x}{(\\pi^2+\\ln^2 x)(1+x)^2} \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt x}=-\\frac{\\pi}{24}$$ Although I could solve it, I am not quite comfortable with the way I did it. But first I will show the way. We can substitute $\\ln x \\rightarrow t\\ $ which gives: $$I=\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{t}{\\pi^2+t^2}\\frac{e^{\\frac{t}{2}}}{(1+e^t)^2}dt\\overset{t=-x}=\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{-x}{\\pi^2+x^2}\\frac{e^{-\\frac{x}{2}}}{(1+e^{-x})^2}dx$$ Also adding the two integral from above and simplify some of it yields: $$2I= \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{x}{\\pi^2+x^2}\\left(\\frac{e^{\\frac{x}{2}}}{(1+e^x)^2}-\\frac{e^{-\\frac{x}{2}}}{(1+e^{-x})^2}\\right)dx$$ $$\\Rightarrow I=-\\frac{1}{4} \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{x}{\\pi^2+x^2}\\frac{\\sinh \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)}{\\cosh ^2\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)}dx$$ And now a round of IBP gives: $$I=\\frac12 \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\left(\\frac{x^2-\\pi^2}{(x^2+\\pi^2)^2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{\\cosh \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)}\\right)dx$$ Using the Plancherel theorem the integral simplifies to: $$I=\\int_0^\\infty \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}x\\left(-e^{-\\pi x}\\right)\\right)\\left(\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\frac{1}{\\cosh(\\pi x)}\\right)dx\\overset{\\pi x\\rightarrow x}=-\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x}{\\cosh( x)}e^{- x}dx$$ We also have the following Laplace tranform for: $$f(t)=\\frac{t}{\\cosh( t)}\\rightarrow F(s)=\\frac18\\left(\\psi_1\\left(\\frac{s+1}{4}\\right)-\\psi_1\\left(\\frac{s+3}{4}\\right)\\right)$$ Where $\\displaystyle{\\psi_1(z)=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(z+n)^2}}\\,$ is the trigamma function . $$\\Rightarrow I=-\\frac{1}{\\pi}F(s=1)=-\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\cdot \\frac18\\left(\\psi_1\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)-\\psi_1 (1)\\right)=-\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\cdot \\frac18\\left(\\frac{\\pi^2}{2}-\\frac{\\pi^2}{6}\\right)=-\\frac{\\pi}{24}$$ Have I done anything wrong, or can it be improved?\nI have to admit that I mostly used wolfram when applying Plancherel theorem  and Laplace transform which I'm not comfortable with, but I didn't find an alternative method myself. For this question I would like to see a different proof that doesn't rely on that theorem. Probably not needed, but I should mention that my contour integration knowledge is pretty low. Also maybe there is a conexion with this integral , but I didn't find any.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "From the identity $$\\Im\\int_0^\\infty e^{-(\\pi-it)x}\\,dx=\\frac t{\\pi^2+t^2}$$ we see that it suffices to compute the imaginary part of the integral $$\\int_0^\\infty dx\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty dt\\;\n\\frac{e^{\\alpha t}}{(1+e^t)^2}e^{-\\pi x}$$ where $\\alpha=1/2+ix$ . Now, the integral with respect to $t$ is easy by means of the substitution $u=e^t$ and using the beta function . We thus get $$\\int_0^\\infty \\pi\\left(\\frac12-ix\\right)\\frac{e^{-\\pi x}}{\\cosh(\\pi x)}\\,dx.$$ Taking the imaginary part we see that the problem boils down to compute the integral $$\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x e^{-\\pi x}}{\\cosh(\\pi x)}\\,dx\n=2\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x}{1+e^{2\\pi x}}\\,dx$$ which, after the substitution $v=2\\pi x$ , reduces to the integral representation of the eta function $\\eta(2)$ . Also notice that taking the real part we obtain the evaluation $$\\int_0^\\infty\\frac1{(\\pi^2+\\log^2 x)(1+x)^2} \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt x}=\n\\frac{\\log2}{2\\pi}.$$ This method generalises to other integrals such as \\begin{align*}\n\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{1}{(\\pi^2+\\ln^2 x)(1+x)^3} \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt x}\n&=\\frac{3\\log (2)}{8 \\pi }-\\frac{3 \\zeta (3)}{16 \\pi ^3}\\\\\n\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\ln x}{(\\pi^2+\\ln^2 x)(1+x)^3} \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt x}\n&=-\\frac{\\pi }{24}\\\\\n\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{1}{(\\pi^2+\\ln^2 x)(1+x)^4} \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt x}\n&=\\frac{5 \\log (2)}{16 \\pi }-\\frac{9 \\zeta (3)}{32 \\pi ^3}\\\\\n\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\ln x}{(\\pi^2+\\ln^2 x)(1+x)^4} \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt x}\n&=-\\frac{223 \\pi }{5760}\\\\\n\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{1}{(\\pi^2+\\ln^2 x)(1+x)^5} \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt x}\n&=-\\frac{43 \\zeta (3)}{128 \\pi ^3}+\\frac{15 \\zeta (5)}{256 \\pi ^5}+\\frac{35 \\log (2)}{128\n   \\pi }\\\\\n\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\ln x}{(\\pi^2+\\ln^2 x)(1+x)^5} \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt x}\n&=-\\frac{103 \\pi }{2880}\\\\\n\\end{align*} Incidentally, since the integrals $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\ln x}{(\\pi^2+\\ln^2 x)(1+x)^k} \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt x}$ both yield the same value for $k=2,3$ , we also deduce $$\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\sqrt x\\ln x}{(\\pi^2+\\ln^2 x)(1+x)^3}\\;dx=0.$$ This, however, should not be surprising due to the symmetry $x\\mapsto1/x$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this Math Stack Exchange question and format it according to the user's requirements. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor, filter out unrelated information, and structure the problem with clear assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nFirst, the original problem is about evaluating an integral and verifying the solution method. The integral given is from 0 to infinity of (ln x) divided by (π² + (ln x)²) multiplied by (1 + x)^2, and then multiplied by dx over sqrt(x). The user solved it using substitution, integration by parts, Plancherel theorem, and Laplace transforms but is uncomfortable with those methods and wants an alternative approach. They also mention possibly a connection with another integral but couldn't find it.\n\nNow, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem. The example provided shows that assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. The problem statement should be the integral to evaluate.\n\nLooking at the original problem, the main assumptions might relate to the integral's limits, the functions involved, or any substitutions made. However, in the example given earlier, assumptions were about the variable (n being an integer and divisible by 7). In this case, the integral is from 0 to infinity, and the integrand involves ln x, (π² + ln²x), (1 + x)^2, and 1/sqrt(x). The user performed substitutions and transformations, but those might be part of their solution attempt rather than assumptions of the problem itself.\n\nWait, the problem as posed by the user is just the integral I. The assumptions would be the conditions under which the integral is defined. For example, the integrand is defined for x > 0 (since ln x is involved and sqrt(x) is in the denominator), but x=0 might be a point to check for convergence. However, in the problem statement, the user is asking to evaluate the integral, so maybe the assumptions are about the convergence of the integral, the behavior of the integrand, etc. But the example given in the user's instruction didn't include such analysis; instead, it listed the problem's given conditions. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, it's for every integer n, but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, that might be a mistake. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal example problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem lists assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" But that seems contradictory because the original problem states \"for every integer n,\" which would mean no restriction on n. But perhaps the user made a mistake in the example? Or maybe they intended to show that even if n is an integer, but the problem actually requires n divisible by 7. Wait, maybe the original example was incorrect? Hmm. But regardless, the format requires listing each assumption line by line.\n\nIn the current problem, the integral is given with specific limits and integrand. The user's own solution involved substitutions and theorems, but the core problem is the integral itself. The assumptions here would be the conditions necessary for the integral to converge, perhaps. For example, the integral is from 0 to infinity, the integrand involves ln x, which is defined for x > 0, and the denominator terms (π² + ln²x) is always positive, so no division by zero. The (1 + x)^2 term is in the denominator, so it's non-zero for x ≥ 0. The 1/sqrt(x) term suggests that near x=0, the integrand behaves like (ln x)/(...) * 1/x^{1/2}. But ln x approaches -infty as x approaches 0, but 1/x^{1/2} goes to infinity. So convergence at 0 and infinity needs to be considered. However, the problem states that the integral equals -π/24, implying it converges. So maybe the assumptions are about the convergence, but in the example, the assumptions were part of the problem's given conditions. Wait, in the example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, and the formatted problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems conflicting. Maybe the example was incorrect. But perhaps in the integral problem here, the only assumption is that the integral converges? But since the problem is to compute the integral, maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond the integral's setup. However, in the example, they listed n being an integer as an assumption. Similarly, here, perhaps the assumptions are that x is a positive real number (since integrating from 0 to infinity), and the integrand is as given.\n\nBut according to the user's example, assumptions are listed as separate points. Let me look again at the example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems like a mistake. Unless the original problem had a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to show that if n is an integer divisible by 7, then A(n) is divisible by 91. But the original problem says \"for every integer n\". So perhaps the example is flawed. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to structure the problem with the necessary assumptions, which in that case, perhaps the problem actually requires n divisible by 7, but the original problem's statement was incorrect. Hmm. This is confusing.\n\nBut given that, for the current problem, the integral is stated as I = ... dx from 0 to infinity, and the problem is to prove that I = -π/24. So the assumptions here would be the conditions required for the integral to be evaluated as such. However, in the example, assumptions were part of the problem's given conditions. Since the integral is presented as is, perhaps the only assumption is that the integral converges, but the user's example included specific conditions on variables. Alternatively, maybe the integral is defined under certain conditions, but the problem as stated doesn't specify any parameters—it's a definite integral with specific limits and integrand. So perhaps there are no explicit assumptions beyond the integral being as given. However, in the example, even though the original problem was for all integers n, the formatted problem included an assumption that n is an integer. So perhaps in this case, the assumption is that the integral is over x from 0 to infinity, and the integrand is as specified.\n\nWait, but in the example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems to change the problem. Maybe that was an error. So perhaps the example is not a good guide. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants to extract hidden assumptions from the problem. For example, in the integral, perhaps the integrand is being considered under certain substitution conditions. However, given the problem as stated, the integral is presented without parameters, so the only assumption is the integral's form and limits. Therefore, in this case, perhaps there are no additional assumptions beyond the integral's definition. However, the user's example included assumptions even when the problem didn't state them. For example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So maybe the assumption is just restating the domain of the variable. So in this integral problem, the assumption would be that x is a real variable in (0, ∞). But since the integral is written as from 0 to infinity, maybe that's already captured in the problem statement. Alternatively, the user might want to list the properties of the integrand. But in the example, they listed the variable's properties. So perhaps here, the assumption is that the integral is over positive real numbers. But since the problem states the integral from 0 to ∞, maybe that's redundant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are that the integrand is defined as given, with the denominator terms non-zero, etc. But that's inherent in the problem. Given the confusion from the example, perhaps the user wants to list the integral's structure as assumptions. However, the example's assumptions were about the variable n. So in this case, since there's no variable but the integral is definite, perhaps there are no assumptions to list. But the example included an assumption even when the problem didn't state it, like n being an integer. So maybe here, the only assumption is that the integral is convergent, but that's part of the problem. Alternatively, maybe there are no assumptions, and the problem is just to compute the integral.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, but following the example where even if the problem states \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, perhaps here the assumption is that the integral is taken over the positive real line. However, since the integral's limits are already from 0 to ∞, that's redundant. Alternatively, maybe the substitution steps used in the solution are considered assumptions, but the user wants the original problem's assumptions, not the solution steps.\n\nWait, the task is to \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" So the goal is to take the original question, filter out irrelevant info, and structure it with assumptions and problem. The example had the original problem which was to prove for every integer n, A(n) divisible by 91, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Unless there was a misread. Wait, the original problem in the example says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That changes the problem. Maybe the example is wrong. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a typo, and the user corrected it. But given that, perhaps the example is not reliable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to extract implicit assumptions from the problem. For instance, in the integral problem, the integrand involves ln x, which requires x > 0, but the integral starts at 0. So maybe the assumption is that the integral is interpreted as an improper integral at 0 and ∞. But that's standard for such integrals. However, in the example, assumptions were about the variable n. So in the integral case, perhaps there are no variables, so no assumptions. But the problem is to compute the integral, so maybe the assumptions are about the existence of the integral. But how to phrase that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is structured as:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral converges.\n\nProblem:\nEvaluate the integral I = ... and show that it equals -π/24.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about the variable's properties, not the convergence. Given the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to look for explicit conditions in the problem statement. The original problem states the integral from 0 to infinity, and the integrand is as given. There are no parameters, so perhaps there are no assumptions beyond the integral being defined as such. Therefore, the formatted problem would have no assumptions, but the example showed that assumptions are listed. Since the example included assumptions even if the problem didn't state them (like n being an integer), perhaps here, the assumption is that x is a positive real number, which is inherent in the integral's limits. But since the integral is from 0 to ∞, x is already positive. Maybe it's redundant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substitution steps are part of the assumptions. But no, assumptions are part of the problem's conditions, not the solution method. The user wants to structure the problem, not their solution. So the problem is to evaluate the integral as given. Hence, the assumptions would be the integral is over x from 0 to ∞, integrand as specified, and the integral converges. But since the problem is to evaluate it, the convergence is part of the problem. Therefore, perhaps there are no explicit assumptions, but in the example, they listed assumptions even when the problem didn't state them. Given that, maybe the answer should have no assumptions, but according to the example, there should be some. Alternatively, perhaps the problem's assumptions are the conditions required for the integral to make sense, like x > 0, integrand is defined, etc. But those are already part of the integral's setup.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, but following the example where even the problem's original statement was for all integers n, but the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, here we might list:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is over the interval [0, ∞).\n\nBut that's already stated in the integral's limits. Alternatively, maybe the substitution variable t = ln x implies x > 0, which is already covered. Alternatively, maybe there are no assumptions, but the example required some. Since the user's example included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (n divisible by 7), perhaps there was a mistake. But given that, perhaps the current problem's assumptions are that the integral is an improper Riemann integral, but that's technical.\n\nAlternatively, since the user's own solution involved substitutions and steps that require certain conditions (like integrability for Plancherel theorem), but the problem as posed is to evaluate the integral, the assumptions would be the minimal conditions needed for the integral to be evaluated as such. But perhaps the answer is that there are no explicit assumptions beyond the integral's definition. However, the example shows that assumptions are listed even if they are part of the problem's statement. Therefore, to adhere to the format, maybe we list:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is taken over x > 0.\n\nBut the integral is from 0 to infinity, which already implies x > 0. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the integral's convergence is an assumption. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral $$I=\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\ln x}{(\\pi^2+\\ln^2 x)(1+x)^2} \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt x}$$ converges.\n\nProblem:\nProve that I equals -\\pi/24.\n\nBut the original problem didn't state that as an assumption; it's part of the problem to show that the integral converges to that value. So perhaps the assumptions are inherent in the problem's setup, and there are none to list. However, the example included assumptions even when the problem didn't state them. Given the confusion, I'll proceed to list the integral's limits and variable as assumptions, even though they are part of the problem statement, to match the example's format.\n\nSo, formatted as:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated over x from 0 to ∞,\nThe integrand is defined as \\(\\frac{\\ln x}{(\\pi^2 + (\\ln x)^2)(1 + x)^2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x}}\\).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the integral equals \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{24}\\).\n\nBut wait, in the example, the assumptions were about the variable n, not the integral's properties. So maybe in this case, since there are no variables with quantifiers (like for all n), the assumptions are unnecessary. But the example included assumptions even when the problem was about an integral. Wait, the example was about a discrete variable n, while this is a continuous integral. Maybe the user wants to list the variable's domain as an assumption. So:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a positive real number.\n\nProblem:\nEvaluate the integral \\(\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\ln x}{(\\pi^2+\\ln^2 x)(1+x)^2} \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt x}\\).\n\nBut the problem in the original post already states the integral from 0 to ∞, which implies x is positive. So perhaps this is redundant. However, following the example's structure where the problem's variable's conditions are listed as assumptions, even if they are part of the problem's statement, here we can list:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a positive real number.\n\nProblem:\nEvaluate the integral \\(\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\ln x}{(\\pi^2+\\ln^2 x)(1+x)^2} \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt x}\\) and show that it equals \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{24}\\).\n\nBut the original problem's title and question already state the integral, and the user is asking to verify their method and find an alternative proof. However, the task is to structure the problem, not the request for help. So the core problem is the integral evaluation. Therefore, the formatted problem should capture the integral to evaluate and the desired result. The user's original problem includes their solution attempt, but we need to filter that out and present just the problem.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is taken over the interval [0, ∞),\nThe integrand is defined for all x > 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\ln x}{(\\pi^2+\\ln^2 x)(1+x)^2} \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt x} = -\\frac{\\pi}{24}.$$\n\nBut the example had each assumption on a separate line, each addressing one property. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a positive real number,\nThe integral is from 0 to ∞.\n\nBut again, the integral's limits already state that. However, to adhere strictly to the example's format, even if redundant, list each assumption separately. Alternatively, since the example included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (n divisible by 7), which seems incorrect, but given that, perhaps the current problem's assumptions are simply that the integral is as defined. Given the ambiguity, I'll proceed to list the integral's properties as assumptions, even if they are part of the problem statement, to match the example's structure.",
