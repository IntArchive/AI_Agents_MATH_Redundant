    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants to show that the Fourier transform of the Fourier transform of a function f is equal to 2π times f(-x). So, mathematically, that's Ẽf(x) = 2πf(-x). \n\nFirst, I need to recall the definition of the Fourier transform given here. The user provided the definition as: \n\\hat f(λ) = ∫_{-∞}^∞ f(t) exp(-iλt) dt.\nWait, actually, in the problem statement, the integral is written as from \"infty\" to \"infty\", which is probably a typo and should be from -infty to infty. So assuming it's the standard Fourier transform.\n\nThe lemmas proved are:\n1. The Fourier transform of E(x) = exp(-½x²) is √(2π) E(x). So, Ẽ(λ) = √(2π) E(λ).\n2. The Fourier transform of f_y(x) = f(x - y) is Ẽf_y(λ) = Ẽf(λ) exp(-iλy).\n3. For φ(λ) = R E(Rλ), the Fourier transform of φ is Ẽ(λ/R).\n4. The duality: ∫ Ẽf(x) g(x) dx = ∫ f(x) Ẽg(x) dx.\n5. The Fourier transform of a convolution is the product of the Fourier transforms: Ẽ(f * g) = Ẽf · Ẽg.\n\nThe user also mentions that f * φ → f as R → ∞, which I think relates to approximating f by convolving it with a scaled Gaussian that becomes a delta function as R increases.\n\nSo, the goal is to use these lemmas to show that applying the Fourier transform twice gives 2π f(-x). Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall that in some conventions, the inverse Fourier transform has a factor of 1/(2π) and the exponent has a positive sign. But here, both transforms are defined with the same exponential sign, so applying it twice might lead to a factor of 2π and a sign change in the argument.\n\nLet me try to compute the double Fourier transform. Let’s denote the first Fourier transform as Ẽf(λ) = ∫ f(t) e^{-iλt} dt. Then the second Fourier transform would be taking Ẽf as a function and transforming it again. Let's call the new variable x instead of λ for clarity. So:\n\nẼ{Ẽf}(x) = ∫ [Ẽf(λ)] e^{-i x λ} dλ = ∫ [∫ f(t) e^{-iλt} dt] e^{-i x λ} dλ.\n\nIf we switch the order of integration (assuming Fubini's theorem applies), this becomes:\n\n∫ f(t) [∫ e^{-iλ(t + x)} dλ] dt.\n\nBut the inner integral ∫ e^{-iλ(t + x)} dλ is the Fourier transform of 1, which is a delta function scaled by 2π. Specifically, ∫_{-∞}^∞ e^{-iλa} dλ = 2π δ(a). So here, a = t + x, so it becomes 2π δ(t + x). Therefore:\n\nẼ{Ẽf}(x) = ∫ f(t) 2π δ(t + x) dt = 2π f(-x).\n\nBut this is a heuristic approach using delta functions, which might not be rigorous. The user wants to use the given lemmas instead, perhaps avoiding distribution theory.\n\nLooking at the lemmas, especially the third one involving φ(λ) = R E(Rλ) and the fifth lemma about convolution. The user also mentions that f * φ → f as R → ∞. Since E is a Gaussian, φ is a scaled Gaussian, which tends to a delta function as R increases.\n\nMaybe the idea is to express the double Fourier transform using these approximating functions and take the limit. Let me see.\n\nFirst, consider that the double Fourier transform is Ẽ{Ẽf}(x). By lemma 4 (duality), if we set g(x) = something related to the Fourier transform, maybe we can relate the integrals. Alternatively, using lemma 5, convolution becomes product. But perhaps the key is lemma 3 and the approximation by φ.\n\nAlternatively, use lemma 4: ∫ Ẽf(x) g(x) dx = ∫ f(x) Ẽg(x) dx. Let's choose g such that Ẽg relates to the double transform.\n\nWait, if we set g to be the Fourier transform of something. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, let's proceed by considering Ẽ{Ẽf}(x). Let’s write this as:\n\nẼ{Ẽf}(x) = ∫ Ẽf(λ) e^{-i x λ} dλ.\n\nBut from the definition, Ẽf(λ) = ∫ f(t) e^{-i λ t} dt. Substitute this in:\n\n= ∫ [∫ f(t) e^{-i λ t} dt] e^{-i x λ} dλ.\n\nSwitch the integrals (assuming Fubini):\n\n= ∫ f(t) [∫ e^{-i λ (t + x)} dλ] dt.\n\nBut the inner integral is problematic as it diverges. However, in the context of tempered distributions, this is 2π δ(t + x). But perhaps the user wants to use the given lemmas with the Gaussian E to approximate this.\n\nSince φ_R(λ) = R E(R λ) and Ẽφ_R(λ) = ẼE(λ/R) from lemma 3. But ẼE(λ/R) = √(2π) E(λ/R). So Ẽφ_R(λ) = √(2π) E(λ/R). Then, as R → ∞, E(λ/R) tends to E(0) = e^0 = 1, so Ẽφ_R(λ) tends to √(2π). But I need to see how this helps.\n\nAlternatively, using the convolution lemma. Since Ẽ(f * φ) = Ẽf · Ẽφ. If we take R → ∞, then φ tends to a delta function, so f * φ tends to f. Then, Ẽ(f * φ) = Ẽf · Ẽφ. Taking R → ∞, Ẽφ tends to √(2π), so Ẽf · √(2π) ≈ Ẽ(f * φ) → Ẽf. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let's consider the duality lemma: ∫ Ẽf(x) g(x) dx = ∫ f(x) Ẽg(x) dx. Suppose we set g(x) = e^{-i x y} or something like that, but that might not directly help.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to use the given lemmas step by step. The user mentioned that the idea is to use the third lemma with a shift and scale of E, and take the limit. Let's see.\n\nConsider taking the double Fourier transform. Let’s denote the first transform as Ẽf(λ), then the second transform would be Ẽ{Ẽf}(x). To compute this, maybe express Ẽf in terms of an integral and then swap the order.\n\nAlternatively, use the inversion formula. Normally, the inverse Fourier transform has a factor of 1/(2π). If the user's transform is defined without that factor, then applying it twice would introduce a 2π factor. But the problem here is to show that the transform of the transform is 2π f(-x), which aligns with this idea.\n\nBut the user's definition doesn't include the 1/(2π) factor, so the inverse transform would have to have that factor. However, since they are applying the same transform twice, it's expected to get a factor of 2π and the inversion.\n\nBut the user wants to prove this using the given lemmas. Let's think about using lemma 4, the duality. Let’s set g to be a Gaussian or related function.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that f * φ_R → f as R → ∞. Then, take the Fourier transform of both sides. So Ẽ(f * φ_R) = Ẽf · Ẽφ_R. As R → ∞, Ẽφ_R(λ) = ẼE(λ/R)√(2π) (from lemma 3). Wait, lemma 3 says φ(λ) = R E(Rλ), so Ẽφ(λ) = ẼE(λ/R). From lemma 1, ẼE(λ/R) = √(2π) E(λ/R). So Ẽφ_R(λ) = √(2π) E(λ/R). As R → ∞, E(λ/R) approaches E(0) = 1, so Ẽφ_R(λ) → √(2π). Therefore, Ẽ(f * φ_R) → Ẽf · √(2π). But also, since f * φ_R → f, then Ẽ(f * φ_R) → Ẽf. But this seems contradictory unless √(2π) = 1, which it isn't. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the convergence is in a different sense. Perhaps in the sense of distributions. Alternatively, the user's approach might involve substituting the definition of the double transform and using the approximating functions to handle the integral.\n\nAlternatively, consider the following. Let’s compute the double transform:\n\nẼ{Ẽf}(x) = ∫ Ẽf(λ) e^{-i x λ} dλ = ∫ [∫ f(t) e^{-i λ t} dt] e^{-i x λ} dλ.\n\nSwap integrals:\n\n= ∫ f(t) [∫ e^{-i λ (t + x)} dλ] dt.\n\nThe inner integral is ∫ e^{-i λ (t + x)} dλ. To evaluate this, we can use the fact that this is 2π δ(t + x), but since we can't use delta functions here, perhaps approximate this integral using the functions φ_R.\n\nSo, consider that ∫ e^{-i λ (t + x)} dλ = lim_{R→∞} ∫_{-R}^R e^{-i λ (t + x)} dλ = lim_{R→∞} [2π δ_R(t + x)], where δ_R is an approximate delta function. Alternatively, using the given function φ_R.\n\nWait, perhaps use the third lemma. Since φ_R(λ) = R E(Rλ), and Ẽφ_R(λ) = √(2π) E(λ/R). Then, as R → ∞, Ẽφ_R(λ) → √(2π) E(0) = √(2π). So, φ_R is such that its Fourier transform becomes approximately √(2π) times a wide Gaussian (since λ/R approaches 0), hence tending to a constant.\n\nBut how does this help? Maybe we can use the duality lemma (lemma 4) with g = φ_R.\n\nWait, using lemma 4: ∫ Ẽf(x) φ_R(x) dx = ∫ f(x) Ẽφ_R(x) dx.\n\nBut Ẽφ_R(x) = √(2π) E(x/R). So,\n\n∫ Ẽf(x) φ_R(x) dx = ∫ f(x) √(2π) E(x/R) dx.\n\nAs R → ∞, E(x/R) → E(0) = 1, so the RHS tends to √(2π) ∫ f(x) dx. But the LHS is ∫ Ẽf(x) φ_R(x) dx = ∫ Ẽf(x) R E(Rx) dx. If we change variables: let y = R x, so dy = R dx, dx = dy/R. Then,\n\n∫ Ẽf(y/R) R E(y) (dy/R) ) = ∫ Ẽf(y/R) E(y) dy.\n\nAs R → ∞, Ẽf(y/R) → Ẽf(0) = ∫ f(t) dt. So, ∫ Ẽf(y/R) E(y) dy → Ẽf(0) ∫ E(y) dy = (∫ f(t) dt) (√(2π)) (since ∫ E(y) dy = √(2π)). Therefore, equating the two sides:\n\n√(2π) ∫ f(x) dx = √(2π) ∫ f(t) dt, which checks out. But this seems like proving Plancherel's theorem or something else, not directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use lemma 5 (convolution) with φ_R. Since Ẽ(f * φ_R) = Ẽf · Ẽφ_R. As R → ∞, Ẽφ_R → √(2π), so Ẽ(f * φ_R) → √(2π) Ẽf. But also, f * φ_R → f, so Ẽ(f * φ_R) → Ẽf. Thus, √(2π) Ẽf = Ẽf, which would imply √(2π)=1, which isn't true. Therefore, this approach must be flawed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps instead of taking R→∞ in φ_R, use a different approach. Let's think back to the double Fourier transform. If we can show that Ẽ{Ẽf}(x) = 2π f(-x), maybe by substituting variables.\n\nLet’s try changing variables in the integral. Let’s define y = -t, so when t = -y, dt = -dy. Then,\n\nẼ{Ẽf}(x) = ∫ [∫ f(t) e^{-iλ t} dt] e^{-i x λ} dλ.\n\nSwap integrals:\n\n= ∫ f(t) [∫ e^{-i λ (t + x)} dλ] dt.\n\nBut if we let s = λ, then the inner integral is ∫ e^{-i s (t + x)} ds = 2π δ(t + x). Therefore,\n\n= ∫ f(t) 2π δ(t + x) dt = 2π f(-x).\n\nBut this uses the delta function, which might not be rigorous. The user wants to use the given lemmas instead. Maybe approximate the delta function by φ_R.\n\nSince φ_R is an approximation to the identity (delta function), then ∫ f(t) φ_R(t + x) dt ≈ f(-x) as R→∞. But the inner integral ∫ e^{-iλ(t + x)} dλ is like 2π δ(t + x), so perhaps use the functions φ_R to approximate this.\n\nAlternatively, using lemma 3: φ_R(λ) = R E(Rλ), whose Fourier transform is Ẽφ_R(λ) = √(2π) E(λ/R). Then, consider that as R→∞, E(λ/R) tends to E(0)=1, so Ẽφ_R(λ) tends to √(2π). Thus, φ_R converges to √(2π) δ(λ) maybe? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, use the duality lemma. Let’s set g(λ) = φ_R(λ) e^{-i x λ}. Then, by lemma 4:\n\n∫ Ẽf(λ) φ_R(λ) e^{-i x λ} dλ = ∫ f(t) Ẽ[φ_R(λ) e^{-i x λ} ](t) dt.\n\nCompute the Fourier transform of φ_R(λ) e^{-i x λ}. By lemma 2, multiplying by e^{-i x λ} corresponds to shifting the function. So, Ẽ[φ_R(λ) e^{-i x λ} ](t) = Ẽφ_R(t - x). But from lemma 3, Ẽφ_R(t - x) = ẼE((t - x)/R) √(2π). Wait, lemma 3 says Ẽφ_R(λ) = ẼE(λ/R). Since φ_R(λ) = R E(Rλ), then Ẽφ_R(λ) = ẼE(λ/R) √(2π)? Wait, lemma 1 says ẼE(λ) = √(2π) E(λ). So, if we have φ_R(λ) = R E(Rλ), then its Fourier transform is:\n\n∫ R E(Rλ) e^{-i μ λ} dλ = R ∫ E(Rλ) e^{-i μ λ} dλ.\n\nLet’s substitute η = Rλ, so dη = R dλ, dλ = dη/R:\n\n= R ∫ E(η) e^{-i μ (η/R)} (dη/R) ) = ∫ E(η) e^{-i (μ/R) η} dη = ẼE(μ/R) = √(2π) E(μ/R).\n\nThus, Ẽφ_R(μ) = √(2π) E(μ/R).\n\nTherefore, back to lemma 4, the RHS becomes ∫ f(t) Ẽφ_R(t - x) dt = √(2π) ∫ f(t) E((t - x)/R) dt.\n\nNow, take the limit as R→∞. Then, (t - x)/R → 0, so E((t - x)/R) → E(0) = 1. So,\n\n√(2π) ∫ f(t) dt. But the LHS is ∫ Ẽf(λ) φ_R(λ) e^{-i x λ} dλ.\n\nAs R→∞, φ_R(λ) = R E(Rλ) approximates a delta function at λ=0 scaled by R. Wait, actually, φ_R(λ) is a scaled Gaussian, so as R increases, it becomes a tall and narrow Gaussian centered at λ=0. Thus, integrating against φ_R(λ) e^{-i x λ} would pick out the value of Ẽf(λ) at λ=0 multiplied by e^{-i x * 0} =1, scaled by the integral of φ_R. But ∫ φ_R(λ) dλ = ∫ R E(Rλ) dλ = ∫ E(η) dη (substituting η=Rλ) = √(2π). Therefore, as R→∞, ∫ Ẽf(λ) φ_R(λ) e^{-i x λ} dλ ≈ Ẽf(0) √(2π). But this doesn't seem to help.\n\nWait, but the RHS tends to √(2π) ∫ f(t) dt, and the LHS tends to Ẽf(0) √(2π). Thus,\n\nẼf(0) √(2π) = √(2π) ∫ f(t) dt ⇒ Ẽf(0) = ∫ f(t) dt, which is true since Ẽf(0) = ∫ f(t) e^{-i 0 t} dt = ∫ f(t) dt. So this checks out, but it's not helping us prove the double transform.\n\nPerhaps a different approach. Let's consider the function E(x) = exp(-½x²) and its properties. From lemma 1, ẼE(x) = √(2π) E(x). Let's take the double Fourier transform of E(x):\n\nẼ{ẼE}(x) = Ẽ{√(2π) E}(x) = √(2π) ẼE(x) = √(2π) * √(2π) E(x) = 2π E(x).\n\nBut according to the desired result, it should be 2π E(-x). But since E(x) is even (E(-x) = E(x)), this is consistent. So for E(x), the double transform gives 2π E(-x). This suggests the result holds for E(x), and perhaps by extension, for all functions via approximation.\n\nBut the user wants to prove it for a general f. Maybe use the fact that Gaussians are dense in some space, and the Fourier transform is continuous.\n\nAlternatively, use the given lemmas with the Gaussian to approximate the double transform. Let’s try to compute Ẽ{Ẽf}(x) using the given lemmas.\n\nConsider that the double Fourier transform is Ẽ{Ẽf}(x). Let's express Ẽf in terms of its inverse transform. But since we don’t have the inverse formula yet, perhaps use the duality lemma.\n\nUsing lemma 4: ∫ Ẽf(x) g(x) dx = ∫ f(x) Ẽg(x) dx.\n\nLet’s choose g(x) such that Ẽg(x) is related to the double transform. For example, let’s set g(x) = Ẽf(x). Then,\n\n∫ Ẽf(x) Ẽf(x) dx = ∫ f(x) Ẽ{Ẽf}(x) dx.\n\nBut this leads to an identity involving the L2 inner product, not directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, choose g(x) = e^{i x y} or something. Not sure.\n\nWait, going back to the problem statement, the user mentions they want to use the third lemma with a shift and scale of E, and take the limit as R→∞. Let's try that.\n\nSuppose we take φ_R(λ) = R E(Rλ), so that as R→∞, φ_R approximates a delta function. Then, consider the convolution f * φ_R → f as R→∞. Taking the Fourier transform, Ẽ(f * φ_R) = Ẽf · Ẽφ_R = Ẽf · √(2π) E(λ/R). As R→∞, E(λ/R) →1, so Ẽ(f * φ_R) → Ẽf · √(2π). But also, since f * φ_R →f, then Ẽ(f * φ_R) → Ẽf. Therefore, Ẽf · √(2π) = Ẽf, which implies √(2π)=1, which is not true. This suggests a contradiction, so perhaps the convergence is in a different topology.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider the inverse direction. If we take the double transform, and relate it to f(-x). Let’s consider that applying the Fourier transform twice gives a reflection and a factor. Let's see:\n\nẼ{Ẽf}(x) = ∫ [∫ f(t) e^{-iλt} dt] e^{-i x λ} dλ.\n\nLet’s change variable in the inner integral: let s = -t, so t = -s, dt = -ds. Then,\n\n= ∫ [∫ f(-s) e^{iλ s} ds] e^{-i x λ} dλ.\n\n= ∫ [∫ f(-s) e^{iλ s} ds] e^{-i x λ} dλ.\n\n= ∫ f(-s) [∫ e^{iλ (s - x)} dλ] ds.\n\nThe inner integral ∫ e^{iλ (s - x)} dλ = 2π δ(s - x). Therefore,\n\n= ∫ f(-s) 2π δ(s - x) ds = 2π f(-x).\n\nBut again, this uses delta functions. To make this rigorous, perhaps use the approximation with φ_R.\n\nAlternatively, use lemma 2 about shifts. If we shift f by y, then the Fourier transform gets multiplied by e^{-iλy}. But not sure.\n\nWait, the user has lemma 5: Ẽ(f * g) = Ẽf · Ẽg. Suppose we take g such that Ẽg is something useful. For example, if we take g = φ_R, then Ẽg = √(2π) E(λ/R). But how does this help?\n\nAnother approach: Use the inversion formula. Normally, the inverse Fourier transform is given by f(t) = 1/(2π) ∫ Ẽf(λ) e^{iλ t} dλ. If we apply the Fourier transform twice:\n\nẼ{Ẽf}(x) = ∫ Ẽf(λ) e^{-iλ x} dλ.\n\nComparing to the inverse transform, this is ∫ Ẽf(λ) e^{-iλ x} dλ = 2π f(-x). So, this is exactly the inverse transform up to a sign in the exponent and the factor. Hence, Ẽ{Ẽf}(x) = 2π f(-x).\n\nBut to prove this without invoking the inversion formula, using the given lemmas, we need to use the provided tools.\n\nThe user mentioned using the third lemma with a shift and scale of E. Let's try to compute the double transform by approximating the integral with φ_R.\n\nLet’s consider:\n\nẼ{Ẽf}(x) = lim_{R→∞} ∫ Ẽf(λ) φ_R(λ) e^{-i x λ} dλ.\n\nBy lemma 4 (duality), this equals lim_{R→∞} ∫ f(t) Ẽ[φ_R(λ) e^{-i x λ} ](t) dt.\n\nFrom lemma 2, the Fourier transform of φ_R(λ) e^{-i x λ} is Ẽφ_R(t + x) (since shifting in λ corresponds to multiplying by e^{-i x λ} in the Fourier transform). Wait, actually, lemma 2 is about shifts in the original function, not in the Fourier domain. Lemma 2 says if f_y(x) = f(x - y), then Ẽf_y(λ) = Ẽf(λ) e^{-iλ y}. So, shifting in the spatial domain by y introduces a multiplicative factor in the Fourier domain.\n\nBut here, we are multiplying by e^{-i x λ} in the Fourier domain, which corresponds to a shift in the spatial domain. Let me check:\n\nIf h(λ) = e^{-i x λ} φ_R(λ), then its Fourier transform is:\n\nẼh(t) = ∫ e^{-i x λ} φ_R(λ) e^{-i t λ} dλ = ∫ φ_R(λ) e^{-i (t + x) λ} dλ = Ẽφ_R(t + x).\n\nYes, so by the shift property, multiplying by e^{-i x λ} in the Fourier domain corresponds to shifting the function by x in the spatial domain. Therefore, Ẽ[φ_R(λ) e^{-i x λ} ](t) = Ẽφ_R(t + x).\n\nFrom lemma 3, Ẽφ_R(t + x) = ẼE((t + x)/R) √(2π). Wait, no: lemma 3 states that φ_R(λ) = R E(Rλ), then Ẽφ_R(λ) = ẼE(λ/R) = √(2π) E(λ/R). Therefore, Ẽφ_R(t + x) = √(2π) E((t + x)/R).\n\nTherefore, the RHS becomes:\n\n√(2π) ∫ f(t) E((t + x)/R) dt.\n\nAs R→∞, E((t + x)/R) → E(0) = 1, so the integral tends to √(2π) ∫ f(t) dt. But the LHS is:\n\nlim_{R→∞} ∫ Ẽf(λ) φ_R(λ) e^{-i x λ} dλ.\n\nBut φ_R(λ) = R E(Rλ), which approximates a delta function at λ=0 scaled by the integral of E. The integral of φ_R(λ) over λ is ∫ R E(Rλ) dλ = ∫ E(η) dη = √(2π). Therefore, ∫ Ẽf(λ) φ_R(λ) e^{-i x λ} dλ ≈ Ẽf(0) √(2π) e^{-i x * 0} = Ẽf(0) √(2π). But this equals √(2π) ∫ f(t) dt, which matches the RHS. However, this doesn't give us the desired result of 2π f(-x).\n\nI must be missing something here. Perhaps another approach is needed. Let me recall that the user mentioned using the third lemma with a shift and scale of E. Maybe consider the following:\n\nExpress f as a limit of convolutions with scaled Gaussians, i.e., f = lim_{R→∞} f * φ_R. Then, take the double Fourier transform:\n\nẼ{Ẽf}(x) = Ẽ{Ẽ(lim_{R→∞} f * φ_R)}(x) = lim_{R→∞} Ẽ{Ẽ(f * φ_R)}(x).\n\nUsing lemma 5, Ẽ(f * φ_R) = Ẽf · Ẽφ_R = Ẽf · √(2π) E(λ/R). Then, take the Fourier transform again:\n\nẼ{Ẽ(f * φ_R)}(x) = Ẽ{Ẽf · √(2π) E(λ/R)}(x).\n\nAssuming we can split the Fourier transform of the product, but that's only possible if it's a product of two functions, which would require convolution. However, this might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, since E(λ/R) is a Gaussian that becomes flat as R→∞, its Fourier transform would be a scaled Gaussian. Let’s compute:\n\nLet’s denote g_R(λ) = Ẽf(λ) · √(2π) E(λ/R). Then, Ẽg_R(x) = √(2π) Ẽ{Ẽf(λ) E(λ/R)}(x).\n\nUsing the convolution theorem (lemma 5), this is √(2π) (f * Ẽ{E(λ/R)})(x). But Ẽ{E(λ/R)}(x) = ∫ E(λ/R) e^{-i x λ} dλ. Let’s substitute η = λ/R, so dη = dλ/R, dλ = R dη:\n\n= ∫ E(η) e^{-i x R η} R dη = R ẼE(R x) = R √(2π) E(R x).\n\nThus, Ẽg_R(x) = √(2π) (f * [R √(2π) E(R x)})(x) = 2π R (f * E(R x)}(x).\n\nBut E(R x) is a Gaussian centered at x=0 with width 1/R, so f * E(R x) approximates f(x) as R→∞. Therefore, 2π R (f * E(R x)}(x) → 2π δ(x) * f(x) = 2π f(x). Wait, but this seems off. If we take R→∞, then R E(R x) tends to a delta function, so f * [R E(R x)] (x) tends to f(x). Therefore, 2π times that would tend to 2π f(x). But we want 2π f(-x). Where does the negative come in?\n\nAh, perhaps there's a sign error due to the Fourier transform definition. Let's check:\n\nWhen we computed Ẽ{E(λ/R)}(x), we had:\n\n∫ E(λ/R) e^{-i x λ} dλ = R ∫ E(η) e^{-i x R η} dη = R ẼE(R x).\n\nBut E is even, so ẼE(R x) = √(2π) E(R x). Wait, no: from lemma 1, ẼE(λ) = √(2π) E(λ). Therefore, ẼE(R x) = √(2π) E(R x). So,\n\nẼ{E(λ/R)}(x) = R √(2π) E(R x).\n\nThus, Ẽg_R(x) = √(2π) (f * [R √(2π) E(R x)})(x) = 2π R (f * E(R x)}(x).\n\nNow, as R→∞, R E(R x) approximates a delta function at x=0 because ∫ R E(R x) dx = ∫ E(y) dy = √(2π). Therefore, f * R E(R x) (x) = ∫ f(x - y) R E(R y) dy ≈ f(x) ∫ R E(R y) dy = f(x) √(2π). Wait, but this leads to 2π R (f * E(R x)}(x) ≈ 2π R f(x) √(2π)/R = 2π √(2π) f(x), which doesn't make sense. I must have messed up the scaling.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps R E(R x) is an approximation to the delta function scaled by √(2π). Since ∫ R E(R x) dx = ∫ E(y) dy = √(2π). Therefore, R E(R x) ≈ √(2π) δ(x). So, f * R E(R x) (x) ≈ √(2π) f(x). Therefore, Ẽg_R(x) ≈ 2π R ( √(2π) f(x) ) / R = 2π √(2π) f(x). Which still doesn’t align with the desired result.\n\nThis seems convoluted. Maybe the answer lies in using lemma 4 (duality) with a carefully chosen g. Let’s set g(λ) = Ẽφ(λ) for some φ.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the user wants to show Ẽ{Ẽf}(x) = 2π f(-x). Let’s take x=0 as a test case. Then Ẽ{Ẽf}(0) = ∫ Ẽf(λ) dλ = ∫ [∫ f(t) e^{-iλ t} dt] dλ = ∫ f(t) [∫ e^{-iλ t} dλ] dt = ∫ f(t) 2π δ(t) dt = 2π f(0). Which matches the desired result. For a general x, shift f by x and use lemma 2.\n\nIndeed, consider f_x(t) = f(t + x). Then, by lemma 2, Ẽf_x(λ) = e^{iλ x} Ẽf(λ). Now, apply the double Fourier transform:\n\nẼ{Ẽf_x}(0) = 2π f_x(0) = 2π f(x). But Ẽ{Ẽf_x}(0) = ∫ Ẽf_x(λ) dλ = ∫ e^{iλ x} Ẽf(λ) dλ = Ẽ{Ẽf}(-x). Therefore, Ẽ{Ẽf}(-x) = 2π f(x), which implies Ẽ{Ẽf}(x) = 2π f(-x).\n\nBut this uses the inversion formula implicitly. However, this approach uses the result at x=0 and shifting, which might be allowed given the lemmas.\n\nAlternatively, use the duality lemma with g(λ) = e^{i x λ}. Then,\n\n∫ Ẽf(λ) e^{i x λ} dλ = ∫ f(t) Ẽ{e^{i x λ}}(t) dt.\n\nBut Ẽ{e^{i x λ}}(t) = ∫ e^{i x λ} e^{-i t λ} dλ = ∫ e^{i (x - t) λ} dλ = 2π δ(x - t). Therefore,\n\n∫ Ẽf(λ) e^{i x λ} dλ = ∫ f(t) 2π δ(x - t) dt = 2π f(x).\n\nBut this is the inverse Fourier transform. Comparing to the desired result, Ẽ{Ẽf}(x) = ∫ Ẽf(λ) e^{-i x λ} dλ = ∫ Ẽf(λ) e^{i (-x) λ} dλ = 2π f(-x).\n\nThus, using the inverse Fourier transform result, we get the desired equality. But the problem is to prove this using the given lemmas without assuming the inverse formula.\n\nGiven that the user has lemma 4 (duality) and the other lemmas, they can set g(λ) = e^{-i x λ} and apply lemma 4, but the Fourier transform of g is a delta function, which requires distribution theory. However, using the approximating functions φ_R, they can avoid delta functions.\n\nThe key steps using the given lemmas would be:\n\n1. Use lemma 4 (duality) with g(λ) = φ_R(λ) e^{-i x λ}.\n\n2. Compute the Fourier transform of g using lemma 2 and lemma 3.\n\n3. Show that as R→∞, the left-hand side approaches Ẽ{Ẽf}(x) and the right-hand side approaches 2π f(-x).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nBy lemma 4,\n\n∫ Ẽf(λ) φ_R(λ) e^{-i x λ} dλ = ∫ f(t) Ẽ[φ_R(λ) e^{-i x λ} ](t) dt.\n\nAs computed earlier, Ẽ[φ_R(λ) e^{-i x λ} ](t) = Ẽφ_R(t + x) = √(2π) E((t + x)/R).\n\nTherefore,\n\nRHS = √(2π) ∫ f(t) E((t + x)/R) dt.\n\nAs R→∞, E((t + x)/R) → E(0) = 1, so RHS → √(2π) ∫ f(t) dt.\n\nBut on the LHS,\n\n∫ Ẽf(λ) φ_R(λ) e^{-i x λ} dλ.\n\nAs R→∞, φ_R(λ) = R E(Rλ) approximates a delta function scaled by √(2π), because ∫ φ_R(λ) dλ = √(2π). Therefore, the LHS tends to √(2π) Ẽf(0) e^{-i x * 0} = √(2π) ∫ f(t) dt.\n\nThis shows that both sides are equal, but not the desired result. Hmm.\n\nPerhaps need to consider a different test function. Instead of shifting by x, maybe use a different approach. Let me consider scaling in the Fourier domain.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that f * φ_R → f and Ẽ(f * φ_R) = Ẽf · Ẽφ_R. Then, take the inverse Fourier transform of both sides:\n\nf * φ_R = Ẽ^{-1} (Ẽf · Ẽφ_R).\n\nBut we don't have the inverse formula yet. However, if we take the Fourier transform of both sides:\n\nẼ(f * φ_R) = Ẽf · Ẽφ_R.\n\nAs R→∞, f * φ_R → f, so Ẽ(f * φ_R) → Ẽf. But Ẽφ_R → √(2π), so Ẽf · √(2π) → Ẽf. This implies √(2π) =1, which is false. Therefore, something's wrong here.\n\nPerhaps the convergence is in the sense of distributions, and we need to pair with test functions. Alternatively, the key is to use the double transform and the properties of the Gaussian.\n\nAnother approach: Compute the double transform of f and use the fact that Gaussians are eigenfunctions of the Fourier transform.\n\nBut since the user has already proved lemma 1, which states that ẼE = √(2π) E, applying the Fourier transform twice gives Ẽ{ẼE} = Ẽ{√(2π) E} = √(2π) ẼE = √(2π) * √(2π) E = 2π E. Since E is even, this is 2π E(-x). So, for the Gaussian, the result holds. For general f, approximate f by a linear combination of shifted and scaled Gaussians, use linearity and continuity of the Fourier transform to extend the result.\n\nBut the user's lemmas include convolution and approximation (f * φ_R → f), so maybe use that.\n\nThus, the strategy is:\n\n1. Show that the result holds for E(x).\n\n2. Use the fact that any f can be approximated by f * φ_R, which are smooth functions.\n\n3. Show that the double Fourier transform of f * φ_R is 2π (f * φ_R)(-x).\n\n4. Take R→∞ to conclude the result for f.\n\nBut let's try to outline this:\n\nGiven f * φ_R → f as R→∞, then Ẽ(f * φ_R) = Ẽf · Ẽφ_R. Taking the Fourier transform again:\n\nẼ{Ẽ(f * φ_R)}(x) = Ẽ{Ẽf · Ẽφ_R}(x).\n\nUsing the convolution theorem in reverse, this equals (f * φ_R) * Ẽ{Ẽφ_R}(x). Wait, no, the product in the Fourier domain corresponds to convolution in the time domain. So, Ẽ{Ẽf · Ẽφ_R} = (Ẽf)ˇ * (Ẽφ_R)ˇ, where ˇ denotes the inverse Fourier transform. But since we are using the same transform, the inverse would involve a sign change in the exponent and a factor.\n\nAlternatively, since Ẽ{Ẽ(f * φ_R)} = Ẽ{Ẽf · Ẽφ_R} = Ẽ{Ẽf} * Ẽ{Ẽφ_R} / (something), but this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, using the result for E(x), and the fact that Ẽφ_R = √(2π) E(λ/R), then the double transform of φ_R is Ẽ{Ẽφ_R}(x) = 2π φ_R(-x) = 2π R E(-R x) = 2π R E(R x) (since E is even). Thus, Ẽ{Ẽφ_R} = 2π φ_R(-x) = 2π φ_R(x) since φ_R is even.\n\nNow, if we take Ẽ{Ẽ(f * φ_R)} = Ẽ{Ẽf · Ẽφ_R} = Ẽ{Ẽf} * Ẽ{Ẽφ_R} / (2π?), but this might not be directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, using the already proven result for E(x), and the fact that the Fourier transform is linear, we can approximate f by linear combinations of shifted and scaled Gaussians, for which the result holds, and then take limits.\n\nBut since the user has the approximation f * φ_R → f, and φ_R is a scaled Gaussian, perhaps use that:\n\nẼ{Ẽf}(x) = lim_{R→∞} Ẽ{Ẽ(f * φ_R)}(x) = lim_{R→∞} 2π (f * φ_R)(-x) = 2π f(-x).\n\nThis requires that Ẽ{Ẽ(f * φ_R)}(x) = 2π (f * φ_R)(-x), which holds because f * φ_R is a smooth function approximated by Gaussians, and we've shown it holds for E(x), hence by linearity and continuity for all such functions.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together using the given lemmas and the approximation argument, the result follows.",
