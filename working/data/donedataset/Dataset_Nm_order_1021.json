    "Content": "For $X$ and $Y$ random variables; $X$ follows the uniform distribution. (1): if $Y=-\\log X$ (2): then it can be shown that $-\\log X$ is distributed as $\\exp(1)$ {i.e. exponential with mean 1}. Why is this so? Intuitively statement (2) make sense to me. But i'd like a mathematical proof. -Probably wrong working: (1) seems to imply $\\exp(-Y) = X$ (which is like saying $X$ is exponentially distributed, which is a contradiction, since its actually uniform!); or is it incorrect for me to do this since $X$ and $Y$ are random variables? Ultimately how do I prove (2)? Thanks",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The trick to resolve this kind of problems is to calculate the distribution of $$Y:F(y) = P(Y<y)$$ In this case, we have $$F(y)=P(\\log X<y)=P(X<e^y) =\\int_0^{e^y}dt$$ Now if you make the change of variable $t=e^u$ , you are able to transform this expression into something of the form $F(y) = \\int_{-\\infty}^y f(u)du$ , and then $f$ will be the density you are looking for.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to prove that if X is uniformly distributed on [0,1], then Y = -log X follows an exponential distribution with mean 1. Hmm, I remember that transforming random variables involves using the cumulative distribution function (CDF) and maybe the change of variables technique. \n\nFirst, since X is Uniform[0,1], its PDF is f_X(x) = 1 for 0 ≤ x ≤ 1. Now, Y is defined as Y = -log X. To find the distribution of Y, I should find the CDF of Y and then differentiate it to get the PDF. \n\nLet's start with the CDF of Y: P(Y ≤ y). Since Y = -log X, this is equivalent to P(-log X ≤ y). Rearranging the inequality, we get P(log X ≥ -y) = P(X ≥ e^{-y}). Since X is uniform, P(X ≥ e^{-y}) = 1 - e^{-y} for 0 ≤ e^{-y} ≤ 1. But e^{-y} is between 0 and 1 when y ≥ 0. So the CDF of Y is 1 - e^{-y} for y ≥ 0. \n\nDifferentiating the CDF with respect to y gives the PDF: d/dy [1 - e^{-y}] = e^{-y} for y ≥ 0. That's exactly the PDF of an exponential distribution with rate parameter 1, which has mean 1. Therefore, Y ~ Exp(1). \n\nWait, the user mentioned something about a contradiction when exponentiating Y. Let me check that. If Y = -log X, then X = e^{-Y}. Since X is uniform, does that mean e^{-Y} is uniform? But if Y is exponential, then e^{-Y} would be the transformation of an exponential variable. Let me confirm: if Y ~ Exp(1), then the CDF of X = e^{-Y} is P(e^{-Y} ≤ x) = P(Y ≥ -log x) = e^{-(-log x)} = x for 0 < x ≤ 1. That's indeed the uniform distribution. So there's no contradiction; it's consistent. The earlier confusion might arise from misapplying transformations without considering the correct variable relationships. \n\nTherefore, the key steps are using the CDF method, correctly transforming the inequality, recognizing the resulting CDF as exponential, and confirming by differentiating to get the PDF. This should be a solid proof.",
