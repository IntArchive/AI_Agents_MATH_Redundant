    "Content": "Let $A,B$ be two $3 \\times 3$ matrices with complex entries such that $$(A-B)^2=O_3$$ Prove that $$\\det(AB-BA)=0$$ I tried to prove this with ranks. I denoted $X=A-B$ and thus $X^2=O_3$ which means that $\\det X=0$ and $\\operatorname{rank}X \\leq 2$ . Then, I wrote $AB-BA=(X+B)B-B(X+B)=XB-BX$ and finally I used $\\operatorname{rank}(M \\pm N) \\leq \\operatorname{rank}M+\\operatorname{rank}N$ and Frobenius's inequality in order to get $$\\operatorname{rank}(XB-BX) \\leq \\operatorname{rank}BX+\\operatorname{rank}XB \\leq \\operatorname{rank}X+\\operatorname{rank}BXB$$ and if we knew that $\\operatorname{rank}BXB=0$ , the problem would be solved. However, I don't quite know if the latter is true.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here is a more or less direct, less creative solution. Since $(A-B)^2=0$, then either $A-B=0$ (in which case $AB-BA=0$), or its Jordan form is $$J=\\begin{bmatrix} 0&1&0\\\\0&0&0\\\\0&0&0\\end{bmatrix}.$$\nSo $A-B=SJS^{-1}$ for some $S$. Let $A'=S^{-1}AS$, $B'=S^{-1}BS$. Then $A'=B'+J$, and $$A'B'-B'A'=(B'+J)B'-B'(B'+J)=JB'-B'J.$$ Now check directly that \n$$\nJB'-B'J=\\begin{bmatrix}B'_{31}&B'_{32}&B'_{33}-B'_{11}\\\\ 0&0&-B'_{21}\\\\ 0&0&-B'_{31} \\end{bmatrix}.\n$$\nThus $\\det(JB'-B'J)=0$. Finally, \n\\begin{align}\n\\det(AB-BA)&=\\det(SA'S^{-1}SB'S^{-1}-SB'S^{-1}SA'S^{-1})\\\\ \\ \\\\\n&=\\det(A'B'-B'A')=\\det(JB'-B'J)=0.\n\\end{align}",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into their specified format. Let me start by reading the problem carefully.\n\nThe original problem is titled \"Prove that det(AB - BA) = 0\". The question states: Let A and B be two 3x3 matrices with complex entries such that (A - B)^2 = O_3. We need to prove that det(AB - BA) = 0.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. Let's list them out. \n\n1. The first thing mentioned is that A and B are 3x3 matrices. So that's an assumption about their dimensions and the set they belong to (complex entries). So \"A and B are 3×3 complex matrices\".\n\n2. The condition given is (A - B)^2 = O_3, where O_3 is the zero matrix. So another assumption is \"(A - B)^2 is the zero matrix\". Since this is applied to the matrix X = A - B, but the problem states it directly as (A - B)^2 = O_3. So each assumption should be on a separate line. \n\nWait, the user's example had each assumption as separate lines. So in the example, they listed \"$n$ is an integer\" and then \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". So each condition on its own line. So here, the assumptions would be:\n\n- A is a 3×3 complex matrix.\n\n- B is a 3×3 complex matrix.\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"Let A,B be two 3×3 matrices with complex entries\". So maybe combine them? Or list separately. The example separated different conditions even for the same object. But here, both A and B are 3x3 complex matrices. Hmm. The user's example had \"n is an integer\", then \"n is divisible by 7\". So maybe each property for each object. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n\nA is a 3×3 complex matrix,\n\nB is a 3×3 complex matrix,\n\n(A - B)^2 is the zero matrix.\n\nBut wait, (A - B)^2 = O_3 is a separate condition. So each of these would be separate lines. So in total, three assumptions: one for A, one for B, and one for their combination.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first two can be combined as \"A and B are 3×3 complex matrices\", but the example had each condition on separate lines. Let me check the example again. The example had two assumptions: \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". So even though both apply to the same object n, they are separate. So in the problem here, A and B are two different objects. So each should have their own assumption. But the problem statement says \"A,B are two 3×3 matrices with complex entries\". So perhaps split that into two assumptions: \"A is a 3×3 complex matrix\", \"B is a 3×3 complex matrix\". Then the third assumption is \"(A - B)^2 is the zero matrix\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem's original statement is that both A and B are 3x3 complex matrices. So the first assumption is \"A and B are 3×3 complex matrices\", but the user's example splits conditions even for the same object. Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the user split into \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". But the original problem in the example didn't have the divisibility by 7; the user added it? Wait no. Wait, let me check the example again.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem is: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n + 1) - 6^n (3^n + 2^n) is divisible by 91.\"\n\nThen the formatted problem's assumptions are:\n\n- n is an integer,\n\n- n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so why is \"n is divisible by 7\" an assumption? That seems like a mistake. Wait, perhaps the user made a typo in the example? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds that n is divisible by 7. That would change the problem. That seems incorrect. Maybe that's a mistake in the example. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to include additional assumptions. Wait, maybe the original problem in the example actually had a condition that n is divisible by 7, but the user wrote the example wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example is a hypothetical to show the structure, not an actual correct problem. Maybe. Because otherwise, if the original problem is \"for every integer n\", then the assumption should not include \"n is divisible by 7\". So perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user is just showing the format. So regardless, the format requires listing each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition to one object.\n\nTherefore, returning to the current problem. The problem states:\n\n- A and B are 3×3 complex matrices.\n\n- (A - B)^2 = O_3.\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n1. A is a 3×3 complex matrix.\n\n2. B is a 3×3 complex matrix.\n\n3. (A - B)^2 equals the zero matrix.\n\nAlternatively, if \"A and B are 3×3 complex matrices\" can be considered one assumption. But in the example, they split the properties even for the same object. But in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which is one assumption, but the formatted problem splits into two. Wait, that's conflicting. Maybe the example is wrong, but the user wants us to list each condition on a separate line, even if they apply to the same object. So for example, if the problem says \"n is an integer divisible by 7\", then split into \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So similarly, here, \"A and B are 3×3 complex matrices\" would need to be split into two separate assumptions: one for A and one for B. However, in reality, the problem states \"Let A,B be two 3×3 matrices with complex entries\", which is a single assumption about both A and B. But according to the user's example, they split even the same object's properties. So perhaps here, we need to split into:\n\nAssumption:\n\nA is a 3×3 complex matrix,\n\nB is a 3×3 complex matrix,\n\n(A - B)^2 equals the zero matrix.\n\nBut maybe the user considers \"A and B are 3×3 complex matrices\" as a single assumption. But the example splits \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So if we follow that, here, since A and B are two different objects, each has their own assumption. So \"A is a 3×3 complex matrix\", \"B is a 3×3 complex matrix\", then the third assumption is the condition on (A - B)^2.\n\nBut actually, the problem statement says \"Let A,B be two 3×3 matrices with complex entries such that (A - B)^2 = O_3\". So maybe the two parts are:\n\n1. A and B are 3×3 complex matrices.\n\n2. (A - B)^2 equals the zero matrix.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So \"A and B are 3×3 complex matrices\" is two objects. So maybe split into two lines: \"A is a 3×3 complex matrix\", \"B is a 3×3 complex matrix\". Then the third line is \"(A - B)^2 equals the zero matrix\".\n\nYes, I think that's the correct approach here. Because each object (A and B) has their own assumption, and then the third assumption is about their combination. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- A is a 3×3 complex matrix,\n\n- B is a 3×3 complex matrix,\n\n- (A - B)^2 equals the zero matrix.\n\nTherefore, the problem part is \"Prove that det(AB - BA) = 0\".\n\nWait, the original problem says \"Prove that det(AB - BA) = 0\". So the problem statement is exactly that, with the matrices as defined.\n\nNow, checking the user's example: in the example, the problem was restated as \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91\". The original problem had \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". But that seems incorrect. Perhaps the example is flawed, but the structure is to list all assumptions given in the problem. So in our case, the problem as stated on Math Stack Exchange has the three assumptions I listed.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n\nA is a 3×3 complex matrix,\n\nB is a 3×3 complex matrix,\n\n(A - B)^2 equals the zero matrix.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that det(AB - BA) = 0.\n\nYes, that seems right. I need to make sure there are no other assumptions. The problem mentions complex entries, which is covered in the first two assumptions. The condition (A - B)^2 = O3 is the third assumption. The problem is to prove the determinant is zero. So this should be correctly structured.\n\nAnother thing to check: the user wants to filter unrelated information. The original question on Math Stack Exchange includes the user's attempt using ranks, Frobenius's inequality, etc. But we should ignore that and focus only on the problem statement. So the assumptions and problem are extracted from the problem statement, not the attempt.\n\nSo the final answer should be:\n\nAssumption:\n\nA is a 3×3 complex matrix,\n\nB is a 3×3 complex matrix,\n\n(A - B)^2 equals the zero matrix.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that det(AB - BA) = 0.",
