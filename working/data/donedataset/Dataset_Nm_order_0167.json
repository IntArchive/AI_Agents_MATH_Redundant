    "Content": "I recently saw a lecturer prove the following theorem (assuming the result that every analytic function is locally 1-1 whenever its derivative is nonzero): Let $\\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{C}$ be open, and let $f : \\Omega \\to \\mathbb{C}$ be 1-1 and analytic on $\\Omega$.  Then $f'(z_0) \\not = 0$ for every $z_0 \\in \\Omega$. I got the basic idea behind the proof: we assume for contradiction that $f'(z_0) = 0$, and, assuming without loss of generality that $z_0 = f(z_0) =0$, we have (from the power-series expansion) that $f(z) = z^kg(z)$ for some analytic $g$ in some disk at the origin (i.e., $z_0$) and some $k \\ge 2$. Since $z^k$ is not 1-1 in any such disk (because there are multiple roots of unity), then $f$ isn't either. However, the proof he gave was rather awkward and technical- it involved defining three different axillary functions, even though the idea was simple, and I've since forgotten how it exactly worked.  In any case, I'm convinced there's a better way. The problem is that I'm having trouble turning the idea into a real proof- I know that it obviously follows if $g$ is 1-1, but I'm also pretty sure that that is too strong an assumption.  Am I missing something, or does the argument just have to be more complicated?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I like proving this theorem via its contrapositive rather than by contradiction (though the computations are essentially the same). Suppose $f:\\Omega\\to\\mathbb{C}$ is analytic with $f'(z_0)=0$.  The goal is to show that every disc about the origin contains distinct $z_1,z_2$ with $f(z_1)=f(z_2)$.  We may assume that $z_0=f(z_0)=f'(z_0)=0$ (using $f(z+z_0)-f(z_0)$ if necessary, as translation doesn't affect injectivity).  Since $f$ is analytic at $z=0$ and $f'(0)=f(0)=0$, $f$ has a power series expansion $$f(z)=a_k z^k + a_{k+1} z^{k+1} + \\dots$$ where $k>1$.  Pulling out a $z^k$ gives $$f(z)=z^k (a_k + a_{k+1}z + \\dots) = z^k g(z)$$ where $g$ is analytic with $g(0)\\neq0$.  Since $g$ is nonzero on a sufficiently small disc centered at the origin, we can define an appropriate branch its log so that its k th root is well-defined.  Call this function $h$, so that $h$ is analytic with $h(z)^k=g(z)$ near the origin.  Hence $$f(z)=\\left(zh(z)\\right)^k.$$  Note that $\\phi(z)=zh(z)$ is analytic (near $z=0$).  Therefore, for any $\\epsilon>0$ (sufficiently small), $\\phi(D(0,\\epsilon))$ is open (by the Open Mapping Theorem) and hence contains a disc $D(0,2\\delta)$.  In particular, there exist $z_1,z_2\\in D(0,\\epsilon)$ with $\\phi(z_1)=\\delta$ and $\\phi(z_2)=\\delta \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i}{k}\\right)$.  Therefore $$f(z_2)=\\delta^k \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i}{k}\\right)^k = \\delta^k = f(z_1)$$ as desired. The proof does look a bit clunky, especially with all the auxilliary functions.  However, it's actually fairly simple and the extra functions are really just to show why each step is valid.  In fact, the gist of the proof is: Show that $f$ is the k th power of some analytic function $\\phi$ Show that you can always find $z_1,z_2$ where $\\phi(z_1)$ and $\\phi(z_2)$ lie on the same circle and their arguments differ by $\\frac{2\\pi}{k}$, so that their k-th powers are equal.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. First, I need to identify all the assumptions mentioned in the original problem. \n\nLooking at the question, the user is talking about a theorem related to 1-1 analytic functions having non-zero derivatives. The key points here are: \n\n1. The setting is an open subset Ω of the complex plane.\n2. The function f is analytic on Ω.\n3. The function f is injective (1-1) on Ω.\n4. The conclusion to prove is that the derivative f’(z₀) is not zero for every z₀ in Ω.\n\nThe user also mentions a proof approach where they assume the derivative is zero at some point and reach a contradiction by expressing f(z) as z^k * g(z) with k ≥ 2, leading to non-injectivity. However, the original proof involved auxiliary functions, and the user is seeking a simpler approach.\n\nNow, I need to list each assumption line by line, making sure each addresses only one property or condition applied to one object. Let me parse the original problem again:\n\n- Ω is an open subset of ℂ.\n- f: Ω → ℂ is injective (1-1).\n- f is analytic on Ω.\n- The problem is to show f’(z₀) ≠ 0 for every z₀ in Ω.\n\nWait, the original problem statement includes the result that if an analytic function is locally 1-1 when its derivative is non-zero. So the theorem they want to prove is that if f is globally 1-1 and analytic, then the derivative is non-zero everywhere. But in their assumptions, do they mention anything about the derivative being non-zero leading to local injectivity? The user says they are assuming that result. However, for the structured problem, the assumptions should be those given in the problem to be proven, not the known results. So the key assumptions here are the ones on f: Ω open, f analytic, f injective. Then the problem is to show the derivative is non-zero everywhere.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- Ω is an open subset of ℂ.\n- f: Ω → ℂ is analytic.\n- f is injective (1-1) on Ω.\n\nEach of these is a separate condition. The problem is to prove that f’(z₀) ≠ 0 for all z₀ in Ω.\n\nThe original problem also mentions that the user tried to approach the proof by contradiction, assuming f’(z₀)=0 and expressing f as z^k g(z) around z₀, leading to a contradiction with injectivity. However, the user is unsure if this approach is sufficient, especially regarding whether g being 1-1 is necessary. But for formatting the problem, we don't need the user's proof attempt; we just need the problem statement structured.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumptions:\nΩ is an open subset of ℂ,\nf is analytic on Ω,\nf is injective (1-1) on Ω.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f’(z₀) ≠ 0 for every z₀ ∈ Ω.\n\nI need to check if there are more assumptions. The original problem also mentions that the lecturer's proof involved auxiliary functions and that the user is looking for a simpler method. But in the problem structuring, we don't include the proof methods or the user's doubts—just the problem's assumptions and the statement to prove.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have the three assumptions listed, each on a separate line, and the problem statement as proving the derivative is non-zero everywhere.",
