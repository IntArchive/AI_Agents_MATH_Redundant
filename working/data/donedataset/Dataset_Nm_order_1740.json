    "AcceptedAnswer": "This proof uses covering spaces, but I'm posting it at the request of orlandpm (the OP). Consider the $2$-oriented graph, $G$: This space is the wedge sum of two circles. Therefore its fundamental group is the free group on two generators $\\langle x, y\\rangle$. This space has the following covering space, $\\widetilde G$: Since the map $p_* : \\pi_1(\\widetilde G) \\to \\pi_1(G)$ induced by the covering space $p : \\widetilde G \\to G$ is injective, it follows that the fundamental group of $\\widetilde G$ is isomorphic to $\\langle x^2, xy, y^2\\rangle$. At the same time, $\\widetilde G$ is homotopy equivalent to the wedge sum of three circles. Therefore its fundamental group is the free group on three generators, $F_3$.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to figure out how to show that the elements x², y², and xy in the free group generated by x and y have no nontrivial relations among them. That would mean the subgroup they generate is isomorphic to F₃, the free group on three generators. Let me start by recalling what a free group is. A free group on a set of generators has no relations except the trivial ones (like gg⁻¹ = e). So, if these three elements x², y², and xy have no nontrivial relations, then the subgroup they generate should be free of rank 3.\n\nThe problem is similar to showing linear independence in vector spaces, but here it's about non-commutative multiplicative independence. I need to ensure that any reduced word composed of these elements and their inverses doesn't simplify to the identity unless it's trivially so. Maybe I can use the uniqueness of reduced words in a free group. \n\nLet me think about how these elements look in terms of x and y. Each of the generators x², y², and xy are words in the original free group F₂. Suppose there's a relation among them; that would mean some product of these elements and their inverses equals the identity. For example, something like (x²)(y²)(xy)^{-1}... etc. equals e. If such a product is trivial, then substituting the expressions in terms of x and y should lead to cancellation. But since F₂ is free, the only way that happens is if the exponents of x and y in the resulting word are all zero. \n\nWait, maybe I can use the universal property of free groups. If the subgroup generated by x², y², and xy is free, then any map from these generators to another group should extend uniquely to a homomorphism. Alternatively, maybe consider mapping these elements to a free group of rank 3 and show the homomorphism is injective. \n\nAnother approach is to use the ping-pong lemma or something related to actions on trees, since free groups can be studied via their actions. But maybe that's too advanced for the context of Artin's Algebra. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the fact that in a free group, a set of elements generates a free subgroup if they don't satisfy any relations. So suppose there is a non-trivial relation. Then there's a non-empty reduced word in the generators and their inverses that equals the identity. Let's write such a word as a product of x², y², xy, and their inverses. Let me see what happens when I expand this product in terms of x and y. \n\nFor instance, the inverse of xy is y^{-1}x^{-1}. Similarly, the inverse of x² is x^{-2}, and similarly for y². If I have a product like (x²)(y²)(xy)^{-1}, that would expand to x²y²y^{-1}x^{-1} = x²y x^{-1}. Which is x² y x^{-1}, which isn't the identity. But that's just a simple example. The key is that any such product, when expanded, would have to cancel out all x's and y's. \n\nBut in F₂, the only way this can happen is if the exponents for each generator in the entire word cancel out. For example, consider a word in the subgroup: each occurrence of x² contributes +2 to the exponent of x, each (x²)^{-1} contributes -2. Similarly, xy contributes +1 to x and +1 to y, and (xy)^{-1} contributes -1 to x and -1 to y. So if there's a relation, the total exponent of x and y must both be zero. But also, the sequence of exponents along the word must cancel step by step, not just the total. \n\nWait, maybe considering the exponents isn't enough because cancellation can happen in the middle. For example, if you have x² followed by x^{-1}, that would leave an x. But in the subgroup generated by x², y², xy, the elements are made up of x², y², and xy, so their inverses would be x^{-2}, y^{-2}, y^{-1}x^{-1}. So when you write a product of these, you can't have a single x or y, only in pairs or combined as xy. \n\nHmm. So if a word in these generators reduces to the identity in F₂, then when written out in terms of x and y, all the exponents must cancel. But because the generators are x², y², and xy, any occurrence of x must come in pairs, except when combined with y in an xy term. Similarly for y. So maybe suppose there's a non-trivial relation, then when written in terms of x and y, the exponents must cancel. But the structure of the generators might prevent that. \n\nAlternatively, think of the subgroup as generated by a, b, c where a = x², b = y², c = xy. Then any relation in a, b, c would imply a relation in x and y. Since there are no relations in x and y, this would mean the relation in a, b, c must be trivial. \n\nBut how to formalize this? Suppose we have a non-trivial word W(a, b, c) = e. Then substituting a = x², b = y², c = xy, we get a word in x and y that equals e. Since F₂ is free, this can only happen if the word reduces to the identity after cancellation. But the structure of the word W(a, b, c) in terms of x and y would involve blocks of x², y², and xy. So perhaps the only way this can collapse is if the word W itself is trivial. \n\nAnother angle: use the fact that the generators are in \"different directions\" in the free group. For example, x² and y² are powers of different generators, and xy mixes them. Maybe a product of these can't cancel unless the exponents are balanced. \n\nAlternatively, consider mapping to an abelian group. If the subgroup had a relation, then abelianizing would give a relation in the abelian group. The abelianization of F₂ is ℤ², and the images of x², y², xy would be (2,0), (0,2), and (1,1). These three elements in ℤ² should be linearly independent over ℤ. Indeed, if a*(2,0) + b*(0,2) + c*(1,1) = (0,0), then 2a + c = 0 and 2b + c = 0. Subtracting gives 2a - 2b = 0 ⇒ a = b. Then substituting back, 2a + c = 0 and 2a + c = 0 ⇒ c = -2a. So the solution is a = b, c = -2a. For example, a = 1, b =1, c = -2 gives 2+(-2) = 0 in both components. But this is a non-trivial relation in the abelian setting. Wait, but in the free abelian group, the rank is 2, so three elements must be linearly dependent. So the abelianization shows that there is a relation in the abelianized group, but that doesn't necessarily mean there's a relation in the original free group. Because the original group is non-abelian, relations in the abelianization don't lift to relations in the original group. So this approach might not help. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the Nielsen-Schreier theorem, which says that subgroups of free groups are free. But we need to show that this particular subgroup is free of rank 3. The Nielsen-Schreier theorem gives that the rank is 1 + 2(3 -1) = 1 +4=5? Wait, no, the formula is rank = 1 + k(n -1), where k is the index. But here the subgroup is not of finite index. Wait, maybe I'm misremembering. The Nielsen-Schreier theorem states that a subgroup of a free group of rank m is free of rank n, where n = 1 + k(m -1) if the subgroup has index k. But in this case, the subgroup generated by x², y², xy is probably of infinite index, so the formula doesn't apply. So maybe not helpful here.\n\nWait, perhaps instead consider the subgroup generated by these three elements. Let's list some elements in the subgroup. For example, x², y², xy, their inverses, and products like x²y², x²xy = x³y, etc. But since the original group is free, there's no relation, so these products can't collapse unless the arrangement allows cancellation. \n\nSuppose there is a non-trivial relation. Let's assume there's a reduced word W in a, b, c (where a=x², b=y², c=xy) such that W(a,b,c) = e in F₂. Since W is reduced, it's a product like a^{k1}b^{k2}c^{k3}... etc., with exponents ±1, and no adjacent inverses. When expanded in terms of x and y, this would be a word in x and y. For this to equal e, all terms must cancel. But given the structure of a, b, c, how could that happen?\n\nFor example, consider a simple case: a * b * c^{-1} = x² y² (xy)^{-1} = x² y² y^{-1} x^{-1} = x² y x^{-1}. Which is x² y x^{-1}, which is not e. So that's not a relation. Another example: a * a^{-1} = e, but that's trivial. What about a non-trivial one? Suppose a^2 c^{-1} a^{-1} c = x² x² (xy)^{-1} x^{-2} (xy) = x^4 y^{-1} x^{-1} x^{-2} x y = x^4 y^{-1} x^{-3} y. Hmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe a product like c a c^{-1} b = (xy) x² (y^{-1}x^{-1}) y² = xy x² y^{-1}x^{-1} y². Simplify step by step: xy x² = x y x² = x (y x²). Then multiply by y^{-1}x^{-1}: x (y x²) y^{-1} x^{-1} = x x² (y y^{-1}) x^{-1} = x^3 x^{-1} = x². Then multiply by y²: x² y². So the product c a c^{-1} b equals x² y², which is a b. So that gives c a c^{-1} b = a b, implying c a c^{-1} = a. But that would imply that a and c commute, which they don't in a free group. But wait, did I compute that right?\n\nWait, let's do it again:\n\nc a c^{-1} b = (xy) x² (xy)^{-1} * y²\n\nFirst, compute (xy) x² (xy)^{-1}:\n\n(xy) x² (y^{-1}x^{-1}) = x y x² y^{-1} x^{-1}\n\nNow, group terms:\n\nx (y x²) y^{-1} x^{-1} = x [ y x² y^{-1} ] x^{-1}\n\nBut in a free group, y x² y^{-1} is just conjugation of x² by y, which is a reduced word. So this becomes x ( y x² y^{-1} ) x^{-1}\n\nMultiply by y²:\n\nx ( y x² y^{-1} ) x^{-1} y²\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. But regardless, this product results in some non-trivial word, not the identity. So even if you try to form a relation, it doesn't collapse. \n\nPerhaps the key is that the exponents of x and y in the words formed by a, b, c have certain parity or divisibility properties. For example, in any element of the subgroup generated by a, b, c, the exponent of x in the entire word is even (from a and c) and the exponent of y is even (from b and c). Wait, let's check:\n\n- a = x²: contributes +2 to x exponent, 0 to y.\n- b = y²: contributes +2 to y exponent, 0 to x.\n- c = xy: contributes +1 to x and +1 to y.\n- c^{-1} = y^{-1}x^{-1}: contributes -1 to x and -1 to y.\n\nSo if you take a product of these generators and their inverses, the total exponent of x would be 2k + m - n, where k is the net exponent from a's, m is the net exponent from c's (each c gives +1, each c^{-1} gives -1), and similarly for y: 2l + m - n, where l is from b's. Wait, no. Let me think again:\n\nEach a contributes +2 to x, each a^{-1} contributes -2 to x.\nEach b contributes +2 to y, each b^{-1} contributes -2 to y.\nEach c contributes +1 to x and +1 to y.\nEach c^{-1} contributes -1 to x and -1 to y.\n\nSo the total exponent of x in a word would be 2*(number of a's - number of a^{-1}'s) + (number of c's - number of c^{-1}'s).\nSimilarly, total exponent of y would be 2*(number of b's - number of b^{-1}'s) + (number of c's - number of c^{-1}'s).\n\nIf the total exponents of x and y must both be zero for the word to be the identity, then:\n\n2*(A) + C = 0 (for x)\n2*(B) + C = 0 (for y)\n\nWhere A is the net a's (a - a^{-1}), B is net b's, and C is net c's.\n\nSubtracting these equations: 2A + C = 2B + C ⇒ 2A = 2B ⇒ A = B.\n\nSubstituting back, 2A + C = 0 ⇒ C = -2A.\n\nSimilarly, since A = B, then 2B + C = 0 ⇒ same equation. So the only solutions are A = B, C = -2A. But A, B, C must be integers. For example, if A = 1, then B =1, C = -2. But this would correspond to a net count of a's: +1, b's: +1, c's: -2. However, this is a necessary condition but not sufficient because even if the total exponents are zero, the word might not reduce to the identity due to the order of terms. \n\nBut this gives a possible way to form a relation. For example, taking a*b*c^{-2} would have A=1, B=1, C=-2. Let's see:\n\na*b*c^{-2} = x² y² (xy)^{-2} = x² y² y^{-1}x^{-1} y^{-1}x^{-1} = x² y x^{-1} y^{-1}x^{-1}. \n\nSimplify step by step:\n\nStart with x² y² (xy)^{-2} = x² y² (y^{-1}x^{-1})(y^{-1}x^{-1}).\n\nMultiply x² and y²: x² y².\n\nThen multiply by y^{-1}x^{-1}: x² y² y^{-1}x^{-1} = x² y x^{-1}.\n\nThen multiply by y^{-1}x^{-1}: x² y x^{-1} y^{-1}x^{-1}.\n\nNow, x² y x^{-1} y^{-1}x^{-1} = x (x y x^{-1} y^{-1}) x^{-1}.\n\nThe term in the middle, x y x^{-1} y^{-1}, is the commutator of x and y, which is not the identity in the free group. So the entire expression is x * [non-identity element] * x^{-1}, which is still not the identity. Hence, even though the total exponents are zero, the word doesn't reduce to the identity. \n\nTherefore, the necessary condition (total exponents zero) is not sufficient. Thus, the subgroup generated by a, b, c cannot have non-trivial relations because any such relation would require the total exponents to be zero, but the actual word still doesn't collapse. Hence, there can be no non-trivial relations, implying the subgroup is free of rank 3.\n\nAnother way to think about this is to use the fact that in a free group, any set of elements that don't \"interfere\" with each other's reduced forms generate a free subgroup. Here, x², y², and xy are such that their occurrences in a word don't allow for cancellation unless explicitly canceled by their inverses. Since each generator involves different combinations of x and y, and their powers, it's impossible for a non-trivial product to cancel out completely.\n\nTo formalize this, suppose we have a non-trivial reduced word in the generators a, b, c and their inverses. When expanded in terms of x and y, this word must contain sequences that cannot cancel out. For example, between any two generators, the transition from one to another doesn't create cancellation. Like, if you have a generator followed by another generator, their x and y parts don't overlap in a way that allows cancellation. \n\nFor instance, consider the word a c = x² xy. When expanded, this is x² x y = x³ y. There's no cancellation. Similarly, c a = xy x² = x y x², which is a reduced word. The only way cancellation can occur is if a generator is followed by its inverse, but since the word is reduced in terms of the generators, that doesn't happen. Therefore, when expanded, the word in x and y is also reduced, hence cannot be the identity unless the original word was trivial.\n\nTherefore, any non-trivial word in the generators a, b, c corresponds to a non-trivial word in x and y, hence cannot be the identity. This shows there are no non-trivial relations, so the subgroup is free of rank 3.",
