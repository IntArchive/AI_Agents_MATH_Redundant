    "Content": "I tried to prove that the area of a rectangle is $ab$ given side lengths $a$ and $b$. The best I can do is the assume the area of a $1\\times1$ square is $1$. Then not the number of $1\\times1$ squares that fit in an $a\\times b$ rectangle is $ab$. Therefore area is $a\\cdot b$. This does not seem rigorous however.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This is a good question! On the face of it, it seems that before you can start being rigorous, you have to define precisely what you mean by the area of a rectangle. But this is just what you are trying to prove! However, there is another approach: you define exactly the properties that you require of a reasonable area metric. Then you adopt these properties as your axioms , and use them to show that an $a \\times\\ b$ rectangle has area $ab$. In a Euclidean plane, we would expect the following axioms to hold for a reasonable area metric on $a \\times b$ rectangles (with $a, b \\ge 0$): $A1$: The area of a $1 \\times 1$ rectangle is $1$. $A2$: Any two congruent rectangles have the same area. $A3$: If a rectangle $R$ is the union of disjoint rectangles $S$ and $T$, then the area of $R$ is equal to the sum of the areas of $S$ and $T$. Given these axioms, I think we can show by induction that for rational numbers $a$ and $b$, the area of an $a \\times b$ rectangle is indeed $ab$. But what about rectangles with irrational sides? I think this might require another axiom: $A4$: If a rectangle $R$ contains a rectangle $S$, then the area of $R$ is not less than the area of $S$. Otherwise you might be able to construct pathological area metrics using the Axiom of Choice. But I am open to correction on this. If anybody can suggest corrections or improvements to this axiom set, feel free to post them as a separate answer, so they don't get lost in the comments.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let me try to tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that the area of a rectangle with side lengths a and b is ab. They mentioned starting with the assumption that a 1x1 square has an area of 1, then tiling the rectangle with such squares and counting them as ab. But they feel this isn't rigorous enough.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the standard approach is for defining area. Typically, in geometry, area is a measure assigned to shapes that satisfies certain axioms, like additivity and congruence. The problem here is about a rectangle, so maybe they need to use those axioms or perhaps use integration for a more formal proof.\n\nBut the user is working at a more foundational level. They assumed the unit square has area 1. Then tiling the rectangle with unit squares. The issue they're facing is that this tiling argument might not be rigorous, especially if the sides a and b aren't integers. For example, if a and b are fractions or irrational numbers, you can't just count whole squares. So their approach works for integers but not for real numbers in general.\n\nSo the problem is to make this proof rigorous for any real numbers a and b. The assumptions should probably include that the area of a 1x1 square is 1, the area is additive for disjoint regions, and congruent shapes have the same area. Maybe also that the area of a rectangle is a function of its side lengths.\n\nWait, the original question didn't specify if a and b are integers. The user's attempt considered tiling with unit squares, which works if a and b are integers, but the question might be more general. The user wants a formal proof, so likely assuming a and b are positive real numbers.\n\nSo, structuring the problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n1. The area of a 1×1 square is 1.\n2. If two regions are congruent, their areas are equal.\n3. The area of a union of disjoint regions is the sum of their areas.\n4. The sides of the rectangle have lengths a and b, where a and b are positive real numbers.\n\nProblem: Prove that the area of the rectangle with side lengths a and b is ab.\n\nBut wait, the original problem statement in the example included only the necessary assumptions. Let me check the example again. In the example, the user wrote:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nAssumptions listed were that n is an integer and divisible by 7.\n\nWait, but the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems contradictory. Maybe the example is not correctly formatted. Wait, perhaps the original problem had a different condition? Let me check the example again.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted assumption lists n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But that's conflicting because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted version adds an extra condition that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Maybe the user made an error in the example. Wait, maybe the original problem had a different condition, but in the example provided by the user, they restructured it, perhaps missing something. Hmm. Anyway, maybe the example is just illustrative.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user wants to structure the problem properly. The original question says \"Prove that area of a rectangle is ab given side lengths a and b.\" The user tried assuming the area of 1x1 is 1, then tiling, but found it not rigorous.\n\nSo, to make it formal, the assumptions needed are the basic axioms of area. The problem is to prove that area is ab under those axioms. So the assumptions should include:\n\n- The area of a unit square is 1.\n- Congruent figures have equal area.\n- If a figure is divided into non-overlapping parts, the total area is the sum of the areas of the parts.\n- The area is a function that is invariant under rigid motions (congruence).\n- Maybe the area is a continuous function of the sides, but that might be more advanced.\n\nAlternatively, in some treatments, the area of a rectangle is defined as base times height, and other areas are derived from that. But in this case, the user is trying to derive it from the unit square.\n\nAnother approach is to use integration. For a rectangle with sides a and b, the area can be computed as the double integral over the region [0,a]x[0,b], which is ab. But that might be using calculus, which is more advanced than needed here.\n\nAlternatively, using the properties of area as a measure. The measure of a rectangle in 2D should be the product of its sides. But again, that's measure theory.\n\nBut the user is looking for a formal proof starting from basic assumptions. So the key assumptions are the unit square area, additivity, and congruence. Then, for arbitrary a and b, how to construct the area.\n\nSo in structuring the problem, the assumptions should list the necessary axioms, and the problem is to show that under those assumptions, area is ab.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were specific to the problem. Here, the problem is general, so the assumptions would be the foundational ones. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe area of a 1×1 square is 1,\nCongruent rectangles have equal areas,\nThe area of a rectangle is additive over partitions along its sides.\n\nProblem: Prove that the area of a rectangle with side lengths a and b is ab.\n\nBut maybe more precise. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, the problem as stated by the user: \"Prove that area of a rectangle is ab given side lengths a and b.\" The user tried using tiling with unit squares but found it non-rigorous because it works for integer sides. So perhaps the key is to extend this to real numbers using limits or something. So maybe the assumptions should include the continuity of area as a function of side lengths.\n\nBut how to structure this? Let's list each assumption as a single line, each addressing one property applied to one object.\n\nAssumption:\nThe area of a square with side length 1 is 1,\nIf two rectangles are congruent, their areas are equal,\nIf a rectangle is partitioned into smaller rectangles, the sum of the areas of the smaller rectangles equals the area of the original rectangle,\nFor any real numbers a and b, the area of a rectangle with side lengths a and b is a continuous function of a and b.\n\nProblem: Prove that the area of a rectangle with side lengths a and b is ab.\n\nAlternatively, the continuity might be an assumption needed for real numbers. But maybe the problem is intended for integer a and b? The original user's attempt used tiling, which is natural for integers, but they want to make it rigorous. If the problem allows a and b to be real numbers, then the tiling approach doesn't suffice. Hence, perhaps the problem assumes a and b are positive integers? Then the tiling works. But the user's question didn't specify. Hmm.\n\nWait, the user's original problem says \"given side lengths a and b\". So unless specified otherwise, a and b can be any real numbers. But the proof using tiling only works when a and b are integers. So to make the proof rigorous for real numbers, we need a different approach, perhaps using the axioms of area.\n\nAlternatively, in some textbooks, the area of a rectangle is defined as base times height, and other areas (like triangles) are derived from that. But here, the user is starting from the unit square.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be approached by first proving for integer sides via tiling, then extending to rational numbers by subdividing unit squares, then using density of rationals to extend to real numbers via limits. That would make the proof more rigorous. But each step would require its own assumptions.\n\nSo for the assumptions, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe area of a 1×1 square is 1,\nCongruent rectangles have equal areas,\nIf a rectangle is divided into smaller rectangles that do not overlap, the sum of the areas of the smaller rectangles is equal to the area of the original rectangle,\nThe area of a rectangle varies continuously with its side lengths.\n\nProblem: Prove that the area of a rectangle with side lengths a and b is ab.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the continuity is not needed if we use additivity for rational multiples and then extend.\n\nBut to structure it properly, each assumption should be a single line, each addressing one property.\n\nAnother angle: the area function is additive over disjoint unions and invariant under congruence, and normalized such that the unit square has area 1.\n\nSo possible assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\nThe area of a square with side length 1 is defined to be 1,\nThe area of a rectangle is invariant under congruence transformations,\nThe area function is additive: if a rectangle is partitioned into finitely many non-overlapping rectangles, the total area is the sum of their areas,\nThe area of a rectangle is a non-negative real number.\n\nProblem: Prove that the area of a rectangle with side lengths a and b is ab.\n\nThis seems better. Each assumption is a single property.\n\nIn the original problem, the user tried using tiling (which is additivity) but didn't state the other assumptions. So to make it rigorous, you need to state those assumptions.\n\nSo the formatted problem would list these assumptions and then the problem is to prove the area is ab.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nThe area of a 1×1 square is defined to be 1,\nThe area of a rectangle is invariant under congruence,\nThe area function is additive over non-overlapping partitions,\nThe area of a rectangle is non-negative.\nProblem: \nProve that the area of a rectangle with side lengths $a$ and $b$ is $ab$.\n###",
