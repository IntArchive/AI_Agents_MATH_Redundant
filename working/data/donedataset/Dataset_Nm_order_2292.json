    "Content": "So, I was playing around on Wolfram|Alpha (as we nerds like to do) and it said cos(1) was transcendental. Could someone provide me with the proof that cos(1) is transcendental?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Since $ i $ is a non zero algebraic number then $ \\lbrace i , 2i ,0\\rbrace $ is a set of distinct algebraic numbers in $\\mathbb{C}$. By the Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem for any non-zero algebraic numbers $ \\beta_{1},\\beta_{2},\\beta_{3} $ we have $ \\beta_1 e^{i} + \\beta_2 e^{2i}+\\beta_3 e^{0}\\ne 0 $. To obtain a contradiction assume that $ cos(1) $ is algebraic. Recall that $ cos(1) =\\dfrac{e^{i}+e^{-i}}{2}. $ Then $ 2cos(1) .e^{i}-e^{2i}-1=0 $ and hence $ (2cos(1) )e^{i}-1.e^{2i}-1.e^{0}=0 $. But this is a contradiction with the Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem. Therefore $ cos(1) $ is transcendental. $\\square $",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants a proof that cos(1) is transcendental. First, I need to recall some mathematical concepts. Transcendental numbers are those that are not roots of any non-zero polynomial equation with integer coefficients. So, unlike algebraic numbers, which can be solutions to such equations, transcendentals like π and e aren't.\n\nNow, cos(1) – here, the argument of the cosine function is 1 radian. I remember that there's a theorem related to the transcendence of trigonometric functions. Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem comes to mind. That theorem states that if α is a non-zero algebraic number, then e^α is transcendental. Also, it implies that trigonometric functions of algebraic numbers (in radians) have transcendental values, except at certain points.\n\nWait, but does that apply here? Let me think. If 1 is an algebraic number (which it is, since it's a rational integer), then according to Lindemann-Weierstrass, e^(i) is transcendental. Then, using Euler's formula, cos(1) can be expressed in terms of e^(i) and e^(-i). Specifically, cos(1) = (e^i + e^(-i))/2. If both e^i and e^(-i) are transcendental, then their sum would be... Hmm, but the sum of transcendentals isn't necessarily transcendental. For example, e + (-e) = 0, which is algebraic. But in this case, e^i and e^(-i) are conjugates. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a direct result about the transcendence of cosine of an algebraic number. Let me check. Yes, actually, the Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem does extend to trigonometric functions. Specifically, if α is algebraic and not zero, then cos(α) and sin(α) are transcendental. Since 1 is algebraic (and non-zero), then cos(1) must be transcendental. \n\nWait, but is 1 considered an algebraic number? Yes, because it's a root of the polynomial x - 1 = 0. So, by the theorem, cos(1) should be transcendental. Therefore, the proof would rely on citing the Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem in the context of cosine of an algebraic number. \n\nBut maybe there's a step-by-step approach. Let's structure it. First, confirm that 1 is algebraic. Then, apply the theorem that if α is algebraic and non-zero, then cos(α) is transcendental. Therefore, since 1 is algebraic, cos(1) is transcendental. \n\nBut wait, does the theorem require α to be in radians? Yes, because otherwise, if the angle were in degrees, it's a different story. But in this case, the problem states cos(1), which is assumed to be in radians. So that's covered. \n\nSo, the key steps are:\n1. 1 is an algebraic number (as it's rational).\n2. By the Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem, for any non-zero algebraic number α, cos(α) is transcendental.\n3. Therefore, cos(1) is transcendental.\n\nI should make sure there are no exceptions here. The theorem applies to α ≠ 0. Since 1 ≠ 0, we're good. If α were 0, cos(0) = 1, which is algebraic. But here α is 1, so it's covered. Therefore, the conclusion holds.",
