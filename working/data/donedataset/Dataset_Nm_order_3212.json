    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user provided an example and wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original question is about proving that a certain series is irrational under given conditions. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that {a_n} is a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers. That's two separate conditions: strictly increasing and each term is a positive integer. Then there's a limit condition: the limit as n approaches infinity of a_{n+1} divided by the product of a_1 through a_n is infinity. \n\nThe problem to be proven is that the sum of 1/a_n from n=1 to infinity is irrational. The user also mentioned trying proof by contradiction and another series involving x^n/a_n, but those might be part of their attempts, not the original problem. The reference to the classical proof of e's irrationality using Taylor formula is probably context. The additional question about the limit of a_{n+1}/a_n going to infinity leading to the same conclusion seems like a follow-up, not part of the original problem.\n\nSo the assumptions should be:\n- {a_n} is a strictly increasing sequence.\n- Each a_n is a positive integer.\n- The limit of a_{n+1}/(a_1a_2...a_n) as n approaches infinity is +infinity.\n\nThe problem is to prove that the sum of 1/a_n is irrational. The rest seems like additional thoughts or related questions, so I should filter those out. Need to ensure each assumption is one line, addressing one property per object. Let me check again:\n\nStrictly increasing: yes, that's one condition. Positive integers: each term is a positive integer, that's another. The limit condition: applied to the sequence's ratio, another separate assumption. The problem statement is to prove the sum is irrational. The other parts like \"proof by contradiction?\" or the mention of Jose Luis Díaz-Barrero are probably part of the original question's context but not part of the structured problem. The additional question about lim a_{n+1}/a_n is a separate query, so it's excluded.\n\nSo, the formatted version should capture the three assumptions and the main problem. Let me structure that.",
