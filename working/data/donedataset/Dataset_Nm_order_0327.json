    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is asking about evaluating the series \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^{3} \\binom{2n}{n}}\\). The original question includes a lot of steps where the user attempted to derive the result using various methods like integrating by parts, using Taylor expansions, and applying properties of the trigamma and polygamma functions. The user arrived at some expressions involving trigamma and tetragamma functions but is stuck on connecting them to the final form given by Wolfram MathWorld.\n\nFirst, I need to structure this problem according to the given format. The key is to list all assumptions and then state the problem. The example provided shows that assumptions are specific conditions or properties applied to the objects in the problem.\n\nLooking at the problem here, the main goal is to evaluate the series. The user has already transformed the series into an integral and then into expressions involving polygamma functions. The assumptions here would relate to the properties of these functions and the steps taken in the derivation.\n\nThe user's assumptions might include the use of the Taylor expansion for \\(\\arcsin^{2}(x)\\), integration by parts, substitution of variables (like \\(x = \\sin u\\)), manipulation of the integral into real parts and series, and application of duplication and triplication formulas for trigamma and tetragamma functions. However, since the task is to list assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object, I need to extract these from the problem.\n\nLooking at the steps:\n\n1. The Taylor expansion of \\(\\arcsin^{2}(x)\\) is used to express the series as an integral.\n2. Integration by parts is applied to the integral.\n3. Substitution \\(u = \\arcsin(x)\\) transforms the integral into one involving \\(\\ln(\\sin u)\\).\n4. The integral is transformed using complex logarithms and series expansions.\n5. Summations are split into series involving trigonometric functions.\n6. Polygamma functions (trigamma \\(\\psi_1\\) and tetragamma \\(\\psi_2\\)) are introduced using their relations to series sums.\n7. Duplication and triplication formulas for trigamma and tetragamma functions are applied to simplify expressions.\n\nEach of these steps relies on certain mathematical assumptions or properties. For example, the validity of the Taylor series for \\(\\arcsin^2(x)\\), the possibility to interchange summation and integration, properties of polygamma functions, and specific formulas like duplication and triplication.\n\nBut in the example given, the assumptions were about the variable \\(n\\) being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem isn't about variables with certain properties but about the methods and functions used. However, since the user is stuck on applying these formulas correctly, perhaps the assumptions are about the properties of the trigamma and tetragamma functions, the convergence of the series, or the steps taken in integration and summation interchange.\n\nWait, the original problem is to evaluate the series, and the user has attempted steps leading to expressions involving polygamma functions. The user's difficulty is in matching their result to the Wolfram MathWorld expression. The key assumptions here would be those that allow the transformation of the series into the integral, the integration techniques used, and the application of polygamma function properties.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions are about the problem's conditions. In the example, the assumption was that \\(n\\) is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is more about deriving an identity, so perhaps the assumptions are the mathematical properties used in the steps. However, the example seems to list the problem's given conditions, not the solution steps. Therefore, maybe in this case, there are no explicit assumptions given beyond the series definition, but the problem is to evaluate it. The user is showing their steps, but the actual problem as posed is to evaluate the series. The Wolfram MathWorld gives a specific form involving trigamma functions and zeta functions. The user's problem is to get from their integral expressions to that form.\n\nWait, the original question is: \"I'm having difficulty getting the result in that form.\" So the problem is to prove that the series equals the expression given by Wolfram MathWorld. Therefore, the assumptions would be the conditions under which this equality holds. Since the series is from n=1 to infinity, and the binomial coefficient is defined for positive integers, the main assumptions are that n is a positive integer, and the series converges. However, the example had specific divisibility conditions. Here, perhaps there are no explicit assumptions beyond the convergence of the series and the validity of the function representations.\n\nBut looking at the example again, the user reformatted the original problem by listing assumptions. The original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted problem listed assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the user says \"for every integer n\", so the example added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that's strange. Wait, looking at the example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the formatted problem added an extra assumption? That seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps there was a mistake in the example. Alternatively, maybe the example was a different problem where the user intended to list the necessary assumptions. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect. But according to the user's instruction, the formatted example had assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which suggests that n being an integer is given, but there's no divisibility condition. So maybe the example was incorrect, but the user wants us to follow that structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example was a different problem where the original problem had an error, and the formatted version corrected it. But given that, perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- The series converges.\n\nBut the problem is to evaluate the sum, so the main assumption is that the series is convergent. However, in the example, assumptions were about the variable's properties. Here, maybe the key assumption is that the series \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^{3} \\binom{2n}{n}}\\) converges, which it does, but that might be considered implicit. Alternatively, there might be no explicit assumptions beyond the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is presented as is, and the assumptions are the definitions used. For example:\n\nAssumption: The binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{2n}{n}\\) is defined for positive integers n.\n\nAssumption: The series \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^{3} \\binom{2n}{n}}\\) converges.\n\nBut perhaps in the context of the question, the user is assuming the steps they took (like using the Taylor series for arcsin²(x), integrating by parts, etc.) are valid. However, according to the example, the assumptions are part of the problem statement, not the solution steps.\n\nTherefore, in this case, the problem is to evaluate the given series, and there are no explicit assumptions beyond the standard mathematical definitions (like the convergence of the series, the definitions of the trigamma and zeta functions). But in the example, they listed n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, perhaps the only assumption is that n is a positive integer (since the series starts at n=1), but that's inherent in the series definition. Alternatively, if the problem involves properties of the trigamma function, maybe assumptions related to that.\n\nBut the user is asking how to get from their steps to the Wolfram result, so the problem is to prove the equality as per Wolfram. Hence, the assumptions would be the mathematical properties used in the proof, but according to the example, the assumptions are part of the problem's conditions. Since the original problem is to evaluate the series, the formatted problem should state the problem as is, with assumptions related to the problem's conditions.\n\nBut in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake, but perhaps the example is flawed. However, following the user's instruction, I need to structure the current problem according to the example.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's question is how to show the series equals the given expression involving trigamma and zeta functions. So the problem is: Prove that \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^{3} \\binom{2n}{n}} = \\frac{ \\pi \\sqrt{3}}{18} [ \\psi_{1} ( \\frac{1}{3} ) - \\psi_{1} ( \\frac{2}{3} ) ] - \\frac{4}{3} \\zeta(3)\\). \n\nThe assumptions here would relate to the definitions and convergence. However, given the example, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n\nBut the example had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. So perhaps here, the assumptions are:\n\n- n is a positive integer,\n\n- The binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{2n}{n}\\) is defined as per standard combinatorial definitions,\n\n- The series converges.\n\nBut the example's assumptions were more about the variable's properties. Here, since the problem is about summing over n, the main assumption is that n ranges over positive integers. But the problem is to sum over n from 1 to infinity, so the assumption is that n is a positive integer. That seems essential.\n\nTherefore, structured as:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nThe series \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^{3} \\binom{2n}{n}}\\) converges.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^{3} \\binom{2n}{n}} = \\frac{ \\pi \\sqrt{3}}{18} \\left[ \\psi_{1} \\left(\\frac{1}{3} \\right) - \\psi_{1} \\left(\\frac{2}{3} \\right) \\right]- \\frac{4}{3} \\zeta(3) \\, ,$$\nwhere \\(\\psi_{1}(x)\\) is the trigamma function.\n\nBut in the example, the assumption was on n being an integer and divisible by 7, which were conditions for the problem. Here, the problem's conditions are that n is a positive integer (in the series sum), and the series converges. But convergence might be considered a given, or it might need to be assumed. Since the user is asking to prove the equality, the main assumptions are that n is a positive integer and the series converges.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is presented as is, perhaps there are no explicit assumptions beyond the series definition. But following the example, which listed n being an integer and divisible by 7 (even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\"), perhaps here the assumption is just that n is a positive integer.\n\nAnother angle: In the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory, but perhaps the example had a different problem. Maybe the original example had a mistake. Anyway, following the user's instruction, we need to extract assumptions from the problem statement.\n\nIn the current problem, the question is to evaluate the series. The assumptions would be the conditions necessary for the problem to hold. Since the problem is to find the sum, the assumptions would be the standard mathematical definitions and convergence. But the example included specific conditions on n. Here, n is an index in the summation, so it's inherently a positive integer. Therefore, the assumption is that n is a positive integer, and the series converges.\n\nBut perhaps in the example, the original problem had an error, and the formatted version corrected it by adding an assumption. But regardless, we have to follow the user's example. Since the user's example added assumptions even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n\", maybe here we need to list the assumptions that n is a positive integer and the series converges.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example was a different problem. Let me check the example again:\n\nOriginal problem in example: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems like the formatted problem added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. That must be a mistake. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem restricts n to be divisible by 7. That's inconsistent. So perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user wants us to follow the format regardless.\n\nGiven that confusion, perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions should just be that n is a positive integer, as the series is from n=1 to infinity. Therefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^{3} \\binom{2n}{n}} = \\frac{ \\pi \\sqrt{3}}{18} \\left[ \\psi_{1} \\left(\\frac{1}{3} \\right) - \\psi_{1} \\left(\\frac{2}{3} \\right) \\right]- \\frac{4}{3} \\zeta(3).$$\n\nBut the user's problem mentions that they have difficulty getting the result in the form given by Wolfram MathWorld. So the problem is to prove the equality as stated. Therefore, the assumptions are inherent in the problem statement: n is a positive integer, the series converges, and the properties of the trigamma and zeta functions hold.\n\nHowever, following the example, which listed assumptions even if they were not explicitly stated in the original problem, perhaps here we need to list the relevant assumptions. Since the example may have been flawed, but the user wants the same structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example intended to list the necessary conditions for the problem. For instance, in the original example, the problem might have had a typo, and the correct assumption is that n is divisible by 7. Alternatively, the problem could have been to prove divisibility by 91 when n is divisible by 7. But given the user's instruction, we need to proceed.\n\nIn the current problem, the key elements are:\n\n- The series sum.\n\n- The use of the trigamma function and zeta function in the closed-form expression.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be the standard mathematical definitions and properties of these functions. But since the example lists explicit assumptions about the variable, perhaps here the only assumption is that n is a positive integer, as the series is defined over positive integers.\n\nSo, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^{3} \\binom{2n}{n}} = \\frac{ \\pi \\sqrt{3}}{18} \\left[ \\psi_{1} \\left(\\frac{1}{3} \\right) - \\psi_{1} \\left(\\frac{2}{3} \\right) \\right]- \\frac{4}{3} \\zeta(3).$$\n\nBut the user's original question also mentions the integral representations and steps taken, but those are part of their solution attempt, not the problem's assumptions. Therefore, the problem is to prove the equality as given by Wolfram MathWorld, with the assumption that n is a positive integer in the series.\n\nAnother angle: The problem could have assumptions related to the convergence of the series, but convergence is typically a given when such series are presented unless stated otherwise. Therefore, the key assumption is that n is a positive integer.\n\nThus, the final formatted problem should list the assumption that n is a positive integer and state the problem to prove the equality involving the trigamma and zeta functions.",
