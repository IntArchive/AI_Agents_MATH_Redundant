    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. So, the question is about showing the equivalence between the convergence in the Lévy metric and the pointwise convergence of distribution functions at continuity points of the limit. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the Lévy metric is. From the definition given, the Lévy distance d_L between two measures μ and ν is the smallest ε such that the distribution function of ν is within an ε-band around the distribution function of μ, shifted by ε in both directions. That is, for all x, F_ν(x) is between F_μ(x - ε) - ε and F_μ(x + ε) + ε. So convergence in this metric would mean that as n goes to infinity, the required ε_n to satisfy this condition for μ_n and μ tends to zero.\n\nOn the other hand, the other side of the equivalence is the pointwise convergence of F_{μ_n}(x) to F_μ(x) at all points x where F_μ is continuous. This is the usual definition of weak convergence in distribution, according to the Portmanteau theorem. So the problem is essentially connecting convergence in the Lévy metric to weak convergence (or convergence in distribution).\n\nI remember that metrics like the Lévy metric metrize weak convergence. That is, convergence in the Lévy metric is equivalent to weak convergence. But here the problem specifically states the equivalence to pointwise convergence at continuity points. So perhaps the task is to prove that d_L(μ_n, μ) → 0 if and only if F_{μ_n}(x) → F_μ(x) for all x where F_μ is continuous.\n\nLet me think about how to approach each direction.\n\nFor the forward direction (⇒): Suppose d_L(μ_n, μ) → 0. Then for any ε > 0, there exists N such that for all n ≥ N, d_L(μ_n, μ) < ε. This implies that for all x, F_μ(x - ε) - ε ≤ F_{μ_n}(x) ≤ F_μ(x + ε) + ε. If we fix a continuity point x of F_μ, then as ε → 0, F_μ(x ± ε) approaches F_μ(x). So taking n → ∞ (and hence ε → 0), F_{μ_n}(x) should be squeezed towards F_μ(x). Therefore, F_{μ_n}(x) → F_μ(x).\n\nFor the reverse direction (⇐): Suppose F_{μ_n}(x) → F_μ(x) at all continuity points x of F_μ. We need to show that d_L(μ_n, μ) → 0. This might involve showing that for any ε > 0, there exists N such that for all n ≥ N, the inequalities F_μ(x - ε) - ε ≤ F_{μ_n}(x) ≤ F_μ(x + ε) + ε hold for all x. Since F_μ is right-continuous and has at most countably many discontinuities, maybe we can use the convergence at continuity points to approximate the values at points near discontinuities. The key is that the Lévy metric allows for both a horizontal (ε shift in x) and vertical (ε shift in F) perturbation, so convergence in distribution (which only requires convergence at continuity points) should imply that these perturbations can be made arbitrarily small.\n\nWait, but how exactly to formalize this? Maybe using the fact that if F_{μ_n} converges to F_μ at all continuity points, then for any ε, we can choose points where F_μ is continuous to bound F_{μ_n}(x) within the required ε-band. Since F_μ is non-decreasing and right-continuous, the discontinuities are jumps, and around continuity points, the function doesn't jump much. So for each x, even if x is a discontinuity, by shifting x a little to a continuity point, we can bound F_{μ_n}(x) using the convergence at nearby continuity points. Then, combining this with the vertical ε allowance in the Lévy metric, we can make d_L(μ_n, μ) go to zero.\n\nThis seems plausible. The detailed proof would involve constructing the appropriate ε for a given n and vice versa, using the pointwise convergence to establish the Lévy metric convergence. Maybe using the fact that the set of continuity points is dense, so for any x, there are continuity points arbitrarily close to x. Hence, the horizontal shift in the Lévy metric can be used to cover the possible discrepancies at the discontinuity points.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a standard theorem that the Lévy metric metrizes the weak convergence, which is equivalent to convergence in distribution, which in turn is equivalent to convergence at all continuity points of the limit. Therefore, the problem is essentially proving that the Lévy metric induces the topology of weak convergence. But since the problem is to show the equivalence between d_L(μ_n, μ) → 0 and convergence at continuity points, maybe we need to directly work with the definitions.\n\nAnother thought: For the reverse direction, assume F_{μ_n}(x) → F_μ(x) at all continuity points. To show d_L(μ_n, μ) → 0, we need that for any ε > 0, eventually F_{μ_n}(x) is within the ε-band around F_μ(x ± ε). Since F_μ is continuous at x ± ε (if ε is chosen such that x ± ε are continuity points?), but F_μ can have discontinuities. However, the Lévy metric requires the inequalities for all x, so we can't just pick continuity points. Hence, maybe using density of continuity points. Since the set of continuity points is dense, for any x, there's a continuity point nearby. Then, by the convergence at continuity points and the right-continuity of F_μ, we can sandwich F_{μ_n}(x) between F_μ(x - ε) - ε and F_μ(x + ε) + ε.\n\nThis seems like a possible path. Maybe a more structured approach:\n\n(⇒) Assume d_L(μ_n, μ) → 0. Then, for any ε > 0, ∃N such that ∀n ≥ N, ∀x, F_μ(x - ε) - ε ≤ F_{μ_n}(x) ≤ F_μ(x + ε) + ε. Let x be a continuity point of F_μ. Then, as ε → 0, F_μ(x - ε) → F_μ(x) and F_μ(x + ε) → F_μ(x). So taking ε → 0 (by letting n increase), the inequalities squeeze F_{μ_n}(x) to F_μ(x). Hence, convergence at continuity points.\n\n(⇐) Assume F_{μ_n}(x) → F_μ(x) at all continuity points. Need to show that for any ε > 0, ∃N such that ∀n ≥ N, F_μ(x - ε) - ε ≤ F_{μ_n}(x) ≤ F_μ(x + ε) + ε for all x. Fix ε > 0. Since F_μ is right-continuous, there exists a continuity point y such that y > x + ε and F_μ(y) is close to F_μ(x + ε). Similarly for x - ε. Wait, maybe we need to use the convergence at x ± ε (if they are continuity points) to bound F_{μ_n}(x). However, x ± ε might not be continuity points. But since F_μ has at most countably many discontinuities, we can approach x ± ε from continuity points. Maybe by considering that for any x, the points x ± ε can be approximated by continuity points, and then using the convergence at those points to establish the bounds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the fact that since F_{μ_n} converges to F_μ at all continuity points, and F_μ is continuous except at countably many points, we can cover the real line with intervals around each x where F_μ doesn't vary too much, and then use compactness or some diagonal argument. But this seems vague.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to use the definition of the Lévy metric. Suppose we want to show that d_L(μ_n, μ) < ε for sufficiently large n. To do this, we need to show that F_{μ_n}(x) lies between F_μ(x - ε) - ε and F_μ(x + ε) + ε for all x. Since F_{μ_n} converges to F_μ at continuity points, and F_μ is continuous at x ± ε for all but countably many x. Wait, no. x ± ε would vary as x varies. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, take a sequence ε_n → 0, and for each n, find the minimal ε such that the inequalities hold. If we can show that ε_n → 0, then d_L(μ_n, μ) → 0. To do this, maybe argue by contradiction: suppose d_L(μ_n, μ) does not go to zero, then there exists a subsequence with d_L(μ_{n_k}, μ) ≥ δ > 0. Then, for each k, there exists x_k such that either F_{μ_{n_k}}(x_k) > F_μ(x_k + δ) + δ or F_{μ_{n_k}}(x_k) < F_μ(x_k - δ) - δ. But if F_μ is continuous at x_k ± δ, then as k increases, F_{μ_{n_k}}(x_k) should converge to F_μ(x_k), leading to a contradiction. However, x_k might be approaching discontinuity points. Hmm, but since there are only countably many discontinuities, perhaps we can extract a subsequence where x_k converges to a continuity point? Or use tightness of the measures.\n\nThis is getting quite involved. I think the key idea is that convergence in the Lévy metric requires uniform closeness of the distribution functions, allowing for both horizontal and vertical shifts, which is exactly what convergence in distribution (pointwise at continuity points) provides when combined with the properties of distribution functions. The detailed proof would require careful epsilon management and using the right-continuity and the convergence at continuity points to establish the required inequalities for the Lévy metric.\n\nIn summary, the problem requires showing that convergence in the Lévy metric implies pointwise convergence at continuity points (which is straightforward by the definition of the metric), and conversely, that pointwise convergence at continuity points implies that the Lévy distance goes to zero, which relies on the properties of distribution functions and the ability to approximate around discontinuities using nearby continuity points.",
