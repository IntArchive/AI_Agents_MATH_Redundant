    "Content": "The question is: Prove that if $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of a matrix A with corresponding eigenvector x , then $\\lambda^2$ is an eigenvalue of $A^2$ with corresponding eigenvector x . I assume I need to start with the equation $Ax=\\lambda x$ and end up with $A^2 x=\\lambda^2 x$ but between those I am kind of lost. I have manipulated the equations several different ways and just can't seem to end up where I need to be. Help would be greatly appreciated as I believe this will be on a test tomorrow.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "We know $Ax = \\lambda x$.  Then $A \\lambda x = \\lambda(Ax) = \\lambda^2x = A^2x$.  Putting this into a more readable mathematical sentence, we get: $$A^2x = A(Ax) = A\\lambda x = \\lambda(Ax) = \\lambda^2x$$ You were done and didn't realize it.  :)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that I need to list all the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then, state the problem clearly.\n\nLooking at the example: The original problem was about proving divisibility by 91, and the assumptions were that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the user didn't mention that n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe the example was modified? Or perhaps the example included an assumption that wasn't explicitly stated but was inferred. Hmm, maybe I need to be careful here.\n\nNow, the problem given here is about eigenvalues. The user's question is to prove that if λ is an eigenvalue of matrix A with eigenvector x, then λ² is an eigenvalue of A² with the same eigenvector x. The user mentions starting with Ax = λx and ending up with A²x = λ²x but is stuck in between.\n\nSo, first, I need to extract the assumptions from the problem. The problem states that λ is an eigenvalue of A with eigenvector x. Therefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n1. A is a matrix (probably square, since eigenvalues are defined for square matrices).\n2. λ is an eigenvalue of A.\n3. x is an eigenvector of A corresponding to eigenvalue λ.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The problem then is to prove that λ² is an eigenvalue of A² with eigenvector x.\n\nWait, but in the example, sometimes assumptions are split into separate lines even if they relate to the same object. Like in the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are two separate assumptions. So here, similarly, λ being an eigenvalue and x being the corresponding eigenvector would be separate assumptions.\n\nSo structuring the problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- A is a matrix.\n- λ is an eigenvalue of A.\n- x is an eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue λ of A.\n\nProblem: Prove that λ² is an eigenvalue of A² with corresponding eigenvector x.\n\nWait, but in the original problem statement, the user didn't explicitly state that A is a square matrix, but eigenvalues are only defined for square matrices. So should that be an assumption? Or is it implied because we're talking about eigenvalues? The example might have added an assumption that wasn't explicitly stated in the original problem. For instance, in the example, the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7, but the formatted problem included that. Wait, actually, looking back, the example's original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If the original problem was for every integer n, then why would the assumption be that n is divisible by 7? That seems contradictory. Maybe the example had a mistake. Hmm, perhaps the user made an error in the example. But regardless, I need to follow the instructions given, which say to filter the unrelated information and structure the problem with assumptions and problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's question is about eigenvalues. The key assumptions here are:\n\n1. A is a square matrix (since eigenvalues apply to square matrices).\n2. λ is an eigenvalue of A.\n3. x is a non-zero vector (eigenvectors are non-zero by definition) such that Ax = λx.\n\nBut the user's problem statement may not mention that x is non-zero, but it's part of the definition of an eigenvector. However, in the problem statement, the user does say \"corresponding eigenvector x\", which implies x is non-zero. So perhaps I should include that as an assumption.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user says \"if λ is an eigenvalue of a matrix A with corresponding eigenvector x\", so the original problem already includes the assumption that x is an eigenvector corresponding to λ. So the assumptions should be:\n\n- A is a matrix (probably square, but need to check if the user's problem mentions that).\n- λ is an eigenvalue of A.\n- x is an eigenvector of A corresponding to λ.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user doesn't explicitly mention that A is square. However, eigenvalues are only defined for square matrices. Therefore, it's an implicit assumption. So perhaps I should list that as an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user assumes that A is a square matrix because they are talking about eigenvalues. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- A is a square matrix.\n- λ is an eigenvalue of A.\n- x is an eigenvector of A corresponding to λ.\n\nEach of these is one line. Then, the problem is to prove that λ² is an eigenvalue of A² with corresponding eigenvector x.\n\nYes, that makes sense. The problem as stated doesn't mention that A is square, but it's necessary for the existence of eigenvalues. So in the formatted problem, we should list that as an assumption.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a square matrix,\nλ is an eigenvalue of A,\nx is an eigenvector of A corresponding to eigenvalue λ.\nProblem:\nProve that λ² is an eigenvalue of A² with corresponding eigenvector x.\n\nI think that's correct. Each assumption is one line, each applying to one object. A is a square matrix, λ is an eigenvalue, and x is the corresponding eigenvector. The problem is to prove the statement about λ² and A².",
