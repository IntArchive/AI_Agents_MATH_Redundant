    "Content": "How can you prove that $$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\\tan^{2}\\left(\\frac{k \\pi}{2n}\\right)\n=\n\\frac{\\left(n-1\\right)\\left(2n - 1\\right)}{3}\n$$ for every integer $n\\geq 1$ > ?. PS: no, it's not a homework... :-)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "By a well know formula we have\n$$\n\\left(\\cos{\\frac{k\\pi}{2n}} + i\\sin{\\frac{k\\pi}{2n}}\\right)^{2n}=(-1)^{k}\n$$\nHence by Binomial theorem we have ($[x]$ is not an integer part, brackets are added for clarity)\n$$\n\\sum_{t=0}^{2n}\\binom{2n}{t}\\left[\\cos{\\frac{k\\pi}{2n}}\\right]^t \\cdot \\left[i\\sin{\\frac{k\\pi}{2n}}\\right]^{2n-t}=(-1)^{k}\n$$\nNow we consider only imaginary part of this:\n$$\n\\sum_{r=0}^{n-1}\\binom{2n}{2r+1}\\left[\\cos{\\frac{k\\pi}{2n}}\\right]^{2r+1} \\cdot \\left[i\\sin{\\frac{k\\pi}{2n}}\\right]^{2n-2r-1}=0\n$$\nDivide it by $[\\cos{\\frac{k\\pi}{2n}}]^{2n}$:\n$$\n\\sum_{r=0}^{n-1}\\binom{2n}{2r+1}\\left[i\\tan{\\frac{k\\pi}{2n}}\\right]^{2n-2r-1}=0\n$$\nNow multiply by $i\\tan{\\frac{k\\pi}{2n}}$:\n$$\n\\sum_{r=0}^{n-1}\\binom{2n}{2r+1}\\left[i\\tan{\\frac{k\\pi}{2n}}\\right]^{2n-2r}=0\n$$\nSo $[\\tan{\\frac{k\\pi}{2n}}]^2$ are roots of the following polynomial:\n$$\n\\sum_{r=0}^{n-1}\\binom{2n}{2r+1}\\left[-x\\right]^{n-r}=0\n$$\nHence by Vieta's_formulas sum of it roots is equal to\n$$\n\\frac{\\binom{2n}{3}}{\\binom{2n}{1}} =\\frac{(2n-1)(n-1)}{3}\n$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example they provided shows breaking down assumptions and stating the problem clearly. \n\nFirst, the original problem is about proving a sum involving tangent squared terms equals a specific fraction. The original question mentions the sum from k=1 to n-1 of tan²(kπ/(2n)) equals (n-1)(2n-1)/3 for every integer n ≥ 1.\n\nNow, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states \"for every integer n ≥ 1\". So the assumptions are about n being an integer and n being greater than or equal to 1. Each assumption should be on a separate line, addressing one property per line. So the first assumption is \"n is an integer\", the second is \"n ≥ 1\".\n\nThe problem part is straightforward: prove the given sum equals that expression. I need to make sure the LaTeX is correctly formatted without any markdown issues. The example used $$...$$ for the equations, so I'll follow that. Also, check if there's any hidden assumption, but the problem seems direct. The user also mentioned filtering unrelated info; the original question had a PS saying it's not homework, which is irrelevant, so I'll exclude that.\n\nSo putting it all together: list the two assumptions, then state the problem. Let me verify with the example given. The example had two assumptions for n (integer and divisible by 7), and the problem statement. Here, similarly, n is integer and n ≥1. The problem is to prove the sum equals that fraction. Looks good. I think this fits the required format.",
