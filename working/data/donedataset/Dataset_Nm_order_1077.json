    "AcceptedAnswer": "An elementary solution: Consider the substitution $$t = \\frac{{64 + 48{x^3} - 96{x^6} + {x^9}}}{{9{x^2}{{(4 + {x^3})}^2}}}$$ $t$ is monotonic decreasing on $0<x<2$ , and $$\\tag{1}\\frac{{dx}}{{\\sqrt {1 + {x^3}} }} = -\\frac{{dt}}{{3\\sqrt {1 + {t^3}} }}$$ this can be verified by explictly computing $(dt/dx)^2$ and compare it to $9(1+t^3)/(1+x^3)$ .

A conceptual solution: Consider the elliptic curve $E:y^2=x^3+1$ , $P=(2,3),Q=(0,1)$ on $E$ , $\\omega = dx/y$ is the invariant differential on $E$ . For the multiplication-by- $3$ isogeny $\\phi:E\\to E$ , we have $3P=(-1,0), 3Q=O$ .

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about proving that a specific integral equals a combination of gamma functions. The user wants the assumptions and the problem clearly separated, with each assumption addressing one property or condition of one object.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original problem. The integral given is from 0 to 2 of 1 over sqrt(1 + x³) dx, and the answer involves Gamma functions of 1/6, 1/3, and 1/2. The user mentioned substitutions and changing bounds, which might relate to Beta functions since Gamma functions often appear in integrals via the Beta-Gamma relation.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the integral's limits are from 0 to 2, and the integrand involves 1/sqrt(1 + x³). The substitution steps mentioned (like t = 1 + x³) lead to transformed integrals, so perhaps the key assumptions relate to the substitution variables or the form of the integral matching a Beta function.\n\nBeta function integrals are typically from 0 to 1, involving terms like x^{c-1}(1 - x)^{d-1}. The user's transformed integral after substitution is from 0 to 1 with x^{-2/3}(1 - x)^{-5/6}, which looks like a Beta function. So maybe the substitution converts the original integral into a Beta function form, and then using the relation B(a,b) = Γ(a)Γ(b)/Γ(a+b).\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would involve the substitution steps and the properties of the Beta and Gamma functions. But the problem is to prove the equality, so the assumptions should list the conditions necessary for the integral to be expressed in terms of Gamma functions. Let's think:\n\n1. The substitution t = 1 + x³ transforms the original integral into a different form. However, the problem's assumptions might not need to list every substitution step, but rather the conditions that make the integral fit the Beta function form.\n\nWait, the example listed assumptions about the variable (n being integer, divisible by 7). Here, maybe the key is the limits of integration and the form of the integrand. The original integral is from 0 to 2. After substitution, it's transformed to a Beta function integral from 0 to 1. So perhaps the substitution used is more specific. The user's transformed integral is (1/6)∫ from 0 to 1 of x^{-2/3}(1 - x)^{-5/6} dx. That integral is a Beta function B(1/3, 1/6), since Beta(a,b) = ∫0^1 t^{a-1}(1 - t)^{b-1} dt. Comparing exponents, a-1 = -2/3 ⇒ a = 1/3, and b-1 = -5/6 ⇒ b = 1/6. Then B(1/3, 1/6) = Γ(1/3)Γ(1/6)/Γ(1/3 + 1/6) = Γ(1/3)Γ(1/6)/Γ(1/2). Since Γ(1/2) is sqrt(π), the integral becomes (1/6) * Γ(1/3)Γ(1/6)/Γ(1/2). So the key steps are substitution to get into Beta form and recognizing the parameters.\n\nBut how to structure assumptions? The problem is to prove the integral equals that Gamma combination. The assumptions would be the necessary conditions that allow the integral to be expressed as a Beta function. But in the example, the assumptions were about the variable n. Here, perhaps the integral's bounds after substitution (from 0 to 1) and the exponents in the integrand. Wait, the problem's assumptions might not be explicitly stated in the original question but inferred. The user's question mentions changing bounds and substitution steps. However, according to the example, the assumptions are listed as conditions applied to one object each. Maybe the substitution variables or parameters. Alternatively, perhaps the integrand's form and the limits.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond the integral's definition, but in the example, the assumption included that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem's statement. Wait, the original problem in the example had the user added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no: looking back, the original example's problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem's assumption listed \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, but the original problem's statement was for every integer n. So perhaps in that example, there was a mistake? Or maybe the user added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, perhaps the user made an error in the example. Wait, the original problem in the example says \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7.\" That seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the original problem was different. Wait, the example's original problem is stated as: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91. Then the formatted problem's assumptions are \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, but in the original problem, n is any integer. So the example seems to have a mistake. Maybe the original problem was actually for n divisible by 7, but the user's example has a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to add the assumption that n is divisible by 7 as part of the problem's conditions. But regardless, following the example's approach, we need to list the assumptions from the problem's context.\n\nIn the current problem, the integral is from 0 to 2, and after substitution, it's transformed to an integral from 0 to 1. The key substitution steps are t = 1 + x³, then another substitution leading to bounds 0 to 1. The user's transformed integral is (1/6) times the Beta function integral. So perhaps the substitution used is u = (t - 1)/8 when t goes from 1 to 9, leading to u from 0 to 1. Alternatively, the substitution could be something like x = 2u, but the user's transformed integral is from 0 to 1. Let me check the original substitution steps:\n\nOriginal substitution: t = 1 + x³, so when x=0, t=1; x=2, t=9. Then the integral becomes (1/3)∫₁⁹ (t - 1)^{-2/3} t^{-1/2} dt. The user then says they tried various substitutions and ended up with (1/6)∫₀¹ x^{-2/3}(1 - x)^{-5/6} dx. How did they get there? Maybe substituting u = (t - 1)/8, so when t=1, u=0; t=9, u=1. Let me try that. Let u = (t - 1)/8 ⇒ t = 1 + 8u ⇒ dt = 8 du. Then the integral becomes (1/3)∫₀¹ (8u)^{-2/3} (1 + 8u)^{-1/2} * 8 du. Simplifying: (1/3)*8^{1 - 2/3} ∫₀¹ u^{-2/3} (1 + 8u)^{-1/2} du = (1/3)*8^{1/3} ∫ ... Hmm, that doesn't seem to directly lead to the user's transformed integral. Alternatively, maybe another substitution. Alternatively, set u = (t - 1)/something else. The user's transformed integral is x^{-2/3}(1 - x)^{-5/6}, which resembles Beta function parameters. Let's see. If the substitution is x = something related to t.\n\nWait, the user's transformed integral is (1/6)∫₀¹ x^{-2/3}(1 - x)^{-5/6} dx. That is exactly the Beta function B(1/3, 1/6), since the exponents are -2/3 and -5/6, which correspond to a-1 = -2/3 → a=1/3, and b-1 = -5/6 → b=1/6. Then B(1/3, 1/6) = Γ(1/3)Γ(1/6)/Γ(1/2). Therefore, the integral is (1/6) * Γ(1/3)Γ(1/6)/Γ(1/2), which matches the right-hand side. So the key is to make a substitution that converts the integral into the Beta function form. But how?\n\nThe user mentions reversing the bounds. Let's see: after substituting t = 1 + x³, the integral is from t=1 to t=9. Then maybe another substitution to map 1 to 9 into 0 to 1. Let’s consider u = (t - 1)/8, so when t=1, u=0; t=9, u=1. Then t = 1 + 8u, dt = 8 du. Substitute into the integral:\n\n(1/3) ∫₁⁹ (t - 1)^{-2/3} t^{-1/2} dt = (1/3) ∫₀¹ (8u)^{-2/3} (1 + 8u)^{-1/2} * 8 du\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (1/3) * 8^{-2/3} * 8 ∫₀¹ u^{-2/3} (1 + 8u)^{-1/2} du\n\n= (1/3) * 8^{1 - 2/3} ∫₀¹ u^{-2/3} (1 + 8u)^{-1/2} du\n\n= (1/3) * 8^{1/3} ∫₀¹ u^{-2/3} (1 + 8u)^{-1/2} du\n\nBut this still doesn't look like the Beta function. However, the user's transformed integral is ∫₀¹ x^{-2/3}(1 - x)^{-5/6} dx. So perhaps another substitution is needed. Let's see. Maybe let v = 8u/(1 + 8u), but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps a different substitution altogether.\n\nAlternatively, starting from the original integral after substitution (1/3)∫₁⁹ (t - 1)^{-2/3} t^{-1/2} dt, let’s set x = (t - 1)/t. Then when t=1, x=0; when t=9, x=(8)/9. Hmm, but that maps to 0 to 8/9, not 0 to 1. Alternatively, set x = 1 - 1/t. When t=1, x=0; when t=9, x=1 - 1/9 = 8/9. Not helpful. Alternatively, set x = 1/t. Then when t=1, x=1; t=9, x=1/9. Not helpful. Wait, perhaps a substitution that inverts the interval. Let’s try substituting s = 9/t. Then when t=1, s=9; t=9, s=1. But this reverses the bounds. Then dt = -9/s² ds. The integral becomes (1/3) ∫₉¹ ( (9/s -1)^{-2/3} ) (s/9)^{-1/2} * (-9/s²) ds. This seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the Beta function can also be expressed as 2∫₀^{π/2} (sinθ)^{2a-1} (cosθ)^{2b-1} dθ, but that might not help here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the substitution x = t/9. Wait, if we set u = t/9, then t=9u, dt=9du. Then the integral becomes (1/3) ∫_{1/9}^1 (9u -1)^{-2/3} (9u)^{-1/2} *9 du. But integrating from 1/9 to 1. This also seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a substitution to make the upper limit go to infinity and recognize it as a Beta function in another form, but I don't think that's the case here.\n\nWait, let's look at the user's transformed integral: (1/6)∫₀¹ x^{-2/3}(1 - x)^{-5/6} dx. The exponents sum to (-2/3) + (-5/6) = - (4/6 + 5/6) = -9/6 = -3/2. Wait, Beta function parameters a=1/3, b=1/6. Then a + b = 1/3 + 1/6 = 1/2. So Γ(a + b) = Γ(1/2) = sqrt(π). Then the Beta function B(a,b) = Γ(a)Γ(b)/Γ(a+b), which gives the desired result. So the key is to express the integral as a Beta function. Therefore, the substitution that maps the original integral to the Beta function form is crucial.\n\nThe user mentioned that reversing from the answer, the integral should be like (1/6)∫₀¹ x^{-2/3}(1 - x)^{-5/6} dx. So perhaps there's a substitution that converts the integral into this form. Let's try to find that substitution. Starting from the integral after the first substitution: (1/3)∫₁⁹ (t -1)^{-2/3} t^{-1/2} dt. Let’s make a substitution u = (t -1)/8. Then t =1 + 8u, dt =8du. The integral becomes:\n\n(1/3) * 8 ∫₀¹ (8u)^{-2/3} (1 +8u)^{-1/2} du\n\n= (1/3) * 8^{1 - 2/3} ∫₀¹ u^{-2/3} (1 +8u)^{-1/2} du\n\n= (1/3) * 8^{1/3} ∫₀¹ u^{-2/3} (1 +8u)^{-1/2} du\n\nHmm, not quite the Beta function. But maybe another substitution inside this integral. Let’s set v such that 1 +8u = 1/(1 - v). Wait, let's think differently. Suppose we set v = (t -1)/t. Then when t=1, v=0; t=9, v=8/9. Then t =1/(1 - v), and dt = dv/(1 - v)^2. Wait, this might not help. Alternatively, set x = (t -1)/t. Then t =1/(1 -x), dt = dx/(1 -x)^2. When t=1, x=0; t=9, x=8/9. Then the integral becomes:\n\n(1/3) ∫₀^{8/9} [ (x/(1 -x))^{-2/3} ] * [ (1/(1 -x))^{-1/2} ] * (dx/(1 -x)^2 )\n\nSimplify exponents:\n\n= (1/3) ∫₀^{8/9} x^{-2/3} (1 -x)^{2/3} * (1 -x)^{1/2} * (1 -x)^{-2} dx\n\n= (1/3) ∫₀^{8/9} x^{-2/3} (1 -x)^{2/3 + 1/2 -2} dx\n\n= (1/3) ∫₀^{8/9} x^{-2/3} (1 -x)^{-5/6} dx\n\nBut the upper limit is 8/9, not 1. To extend to 1, perhaps another substitution. Let’s set y = (9/8)x, so when x=8/9, y=1. Then x= (8/9)y, dx= (8/9)dy. Substitute:\n\n= (1/3) ∫₀¹ ( (8/9 y)^{-2/3} (1 - (8/9 y))^{-5/6} * (8/9) dy\n\n= (1/3) * (8/9)^{1 -2/3} ∫₀¹ y^{-2/3} (1 - (8/9)y)^{-5/6} dy\n\nBut this introduces a factor and a term (1 - (8/9)y), which complicates things. It doesn't simplify to the desired Beta function. Therefore, perhaps a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, consider the substitution x = (t -1)/ (t). Then t =1/(1 -x), and when t=1, x=0; t approaches infinity, x approaches 1. But in our case t goes up to 9, so x would be 8/9. Not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the substitution x =1 - 8/(t -1). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think about the integral in terms of the Beta function properties. The Beta function can also be expressed as ∫₀^∞ t^{c-1}/(1 + t)^{c + d} dt = B(c,d). But not sure if that applies here.\n\nWait, the user's transformed integral is ∫₀¹ x^{-2/3}(1 - x)^{-5/6} dx. This is exactly B(1/3, 1/6). So maybe there's a substitution that directly transforms the integral after the first substitution into this Beta form. Let's go back to the integral after substituting t =1 +x³: (1/3)∫₁⁹ (t -1)^{-2/3} t^{-1/2} dt. Let's write this as (1/3)∫₁⁹ (t -1)^{-2/3} t^{-1/2} dt.\n\nLet’s make the substitution u = (t -1)/t. Then t =1/(1 -u), dt = du/(1 -u)^2. When t=1, u=0; t=9, u=8/9. Then the integral becomes:\n\n(1/3) ∫₀^{8/9} [ (u/(1 -u))^{-2/3} ] * [ (1/(1 -u))^{-1/2} ] * [ du/(1 -u)^2 ]\n\nSimplify the exponents:\n\n= (1/3) ∫₀^{8/9} u^{-2/3} (1 -u)^{2/3} * (1 -u)^{1/2} * (1 -u)^{-2} du\n\n= (1/3) ∫₀^{8/9} u^{-2/3} (1 -u)^{2/3 + 1/2 -2} du\n\nCalculate the exponent of (1 -u):\n\n2/3 + 1/2 - 2 = (4/6 + 3/6 - 12/6) = (-5/6)\n\nSo:\n\n= (1/3) ∫₀^{8/9} u^{-2/3} (1 -u)^{-5/6} du\n\nThis is almost the Beta function integral except the upper limit is 8/9 instead of 1. If we can extend the integral to 1, but the integrand from 8/9 to 1 would add an extra part. However, perhaps there's a substitution that scales the interval. Let’s set y = u/(8/9), so when u=8/9, y=1. Then u= (8/9)y, du= (8/9)dy. Substitute:\n\n= (1/3) ∫₀¹ ((8/9)y)^{-2/3} (1 - (8/9)y)^{-5/6} * (8/9) dy\n\n= (1/3) * (8/9)^{1 - 2/3} ∫₀¹ y^{-2/3} (1 - (8/9)y)^{-5/6} dy\n\n= (1/3) * (8/9)^{1/3} ∫₀¹ y^{-2/3} (1 - (8/9)y)^{-5/6} dy\n\nThis still doesn't match the Beta function unless (8/9)y is negligible or the term (1 - (8/9)y) can be transformed. It seems this path isn't working. Maybe the original substitution approach isn't the right way. Let's look back at the user's transformed integral: (1/6)∫₀¹ x^{-2/3}(1 -x)^{-5/6} dx. How did they get the 1/6 factor and the bounds?\n\nAnother approach: recognize that 1/3 * 8^{1/3} might relate to 1/6. Let's calculate 8^{1/3} = 2. So 1/3 * 2 = 2/3. Not 1/6. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe there's a different substitution after the first step.\n\nWait, the user mentions that the trickiest part is the bounds and that reversing it from the answer, the integral should be like (1/6)∫₀¹ x^{-2/3}(1 -x)^{-5/6} dx. So perhaps there's a substitution that when applied to the integral after t =1 +x³ gives a Beta function with a factor of 1/6. Let's try to find that substitution.\n\nThe integral after substitution is (1/3)∫₁⁹ (t -1)^{-2/3} t^{-1/2} dt. Let’s consider substituting x = (t -1)/8. Then t =1 +8x, dt=8dx. When t=1, x=0; t=9, x=1. Substitute into the integral:\n\n= (1/3) ∫₀¹ (8x)^{-2/3} (1 +8x)^{-1/2} *8 dx\n\n= (1/3) *8^{1 -2/3} ∫₀¹ x^{-2/3} (1 +8x)^{-1/2} dx\n\n= (1/3) *8^{1/3} ∫₀¹ x^{-2/3} (1 +8x)^{-1/2} dx\n\nNow, 8^{1/3} =2, so this becomes (2/3)∫₀¹ x^{-2/3} (1 +8x)^{-1/2} dx. Still not matching the Beta function.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider a substitution inside this integral. Let’s set y =8x. Then x = y/8, dx= dy/8. When x=0, y=0; x=1, y=8. The integral becomes:\n\n(2/3) ∫₀⁸ (y/8)^{-2/3} (1 + y)^{-1/2} * (1/8) dy\n\n= (2/3)*(1/8)*8^{2/3} ∫₀⁸ y^{-2/3} (1 + y)^{-1/2} dy\n\nSimplify constants:\n\n= (2/(24)) *8^{2/3} ∫₀⁸ y^{-2/3} (1 + y)^{-1/2} dy\n\n= (1/12)*8^{2/3} ∫₀⁸ y^{-2/3} (1 + y)^{-1/2} dy\n\nBut 8^{2/3}=4, so:\n\n= (1/12)*4 ∫₀⁸ y^{-2/3} (1 + y)^{-1/2} dy\n\n= (1/3) ∫₀⁸ y^{-2/3} (1 + y)^{-1/2} dy\n\nThis integral resembles the Beta function in the form ∫₀^∞ y^{c-1}/(1 + y)^{c + d} dy = B(c,d), but our integral is from 0 to 8. However, if the upper limit were infinity, it would be B(1/3, 1/6). But since it's up to 8, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps another substitution. Let’s set z = y/(1 + y). Then y = z/(1 -z), dy = dz/(1 -z)^2. When y=0, z=0; y=8, z=8/9. The integral becomes:\n\n= (1/3) ∫₀^{8/9} (z/(1 -z))^{-2/3} (1 + z/(1 -z))^{-1/2} * (1/(1 -z)^2) dz\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (1/3) ∫₀^{8/9} z^{-2/3} (1 -z)^{2/3} * (1/(1 -z))^{-1/2} * (1 -z)^{-2} dz\n\n= (1/3) ∫₀^{8/9} z^{-2/3} (1 -z)^{2/3 +1/2 -2} dz\n\n= (1/3) ∫₀^{8/9} z^{-2/3} (1 -z)^{-5/6} dz\n\nThis is the same integral as before, still up to 8/9. It seems no matter the substitution, we can't get to 1 unless we extend the upper limit, which isn't valid. Therefore, perhaps the correct substitution is different.\n\nWait, the user mentions that reversing from the answer, the integral should be like (1/6)∫₀¹ x^{-2/3}(1 -x)^{-5/6} dx. So maybe there's a substitution that directly converts the original integral to this form without going through the first substitution. Let's try to find that.\n\nOriginal integral: ∫₀² 1/sqrt(1 +x³) dx. Let's make a substitution that maps x from 0 to 2 to t from 0 to1. Let’s set x = 2t^k for some exponent k. Then dx = 2k t^{k-1} dt. The integral becomes ∫₀¹ 1/sqrt(1 + (2t^k)^3) * 2k t^{k-1} dt. This needs to match the form x^{-2/3}(1 -x)^{-5/6}. It might not be straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps set t = x³ +1, but that's similar to the first substitution.\n\nAlternatively, consider hypergeometric functions or recognizing the integral as an elliptic integral, but the answer is in terms of Gamma functions, which suggests a Beta function connection. The key is to find a substitution that converts the original integral into a Beta function form.\n\nAnother approach: The integral ∫ dx/sqrt(1 +x³) can be expressed in terms of the Beta function using the substitution x = (t -1)^{a}... Not sure. Alternatively, recall that the Beta function can be expressed using the substitution x = t/(1 + t). Let’s try x = t/(1 - t), which maps t from 0 to1 as x goes from 0 to infinity. But our integral is up to 2. Let's set t = x/(2), so x=2t, dx=2dt. Then the integral becomes ∫₀¹ 2 dt / sqrt(1 + (2t)^3) = 2 ∫₀¹ dt / sqrt(1 +8t³). Still not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe another substitution inspired by the Beta function parameters. The exponents in the Beta function are -2/3 and -5/6. Let’s add 1 to each to get 1/3 and 1/6, which are the parameters a and b. The sum a + b =1/3 +1/6=1/2. This suggests that the substitution should lead to an integral of the form ∫₀¹ t^{a-1}(1 -t)^{b-1} dt = B(a,b). So perhaps the substitution is designed to make the integrand match that form.\n\nAlternatively, suppose we set t = x³ +1, then dt = 3x² dx. But x = (t -1)^{1/3}. Then dx = (1/3)(t -1)^{-2/3} dt. Then the original integral becomes ∫₁⁹ [1/sqrt(t)] * (1/3)(t -1)^{-2/3} dt. Which is (1/3)∫₁⁹ t^{-1/2} (t -1)^{-2/3} dt. This is exactly the integral after the first substitution. So the user did that.\n\nNow, the user wants to get to ∫₀¹ x^{-2/3}(1 -x)^{-5/6} dx. So perhaps another substitution in this integral. Let’s set u = (t -1)/t. Then t =1/(1 -u), dt = du/(1 -u)^2. When t=1, u=0; t=9, u=8/9. Then the integral becomes:\n\n(1/3) ∫₀^{8/9} [ (1/(1 -u) -1 )^{-2/3} ] * [ (1/(1 -u))^{-1/2} ] * [ du/(1 -u)^2 ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (1/3) ∫₀^{8/9} [ (u/(1 -u))^{-2/3} ] * (1 -u)^{1/2} * (1 -u)^{-2} du\n\n= (1/3) ∫₀^{8/9} u^{-2/3} (1 -u)^{2/3 +1/2 -2} du\n\n= (1/3) ∫₀^{8/9} u^{-2/3} (1 -u)^{-5/6} du\n\nAgain, the same result. But the upper limit is 8/9. To make it 1, perhaps extend the integral and show that the added part is zero, but that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe there's a symmetry or another substitution.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the integral from 0 to8/9 can be expressed as Beta(1/3,1/6) minus the integral from8/9 to1. But that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps a substitution that stretches the interval. Let’s set y = u/(8/9), so u= (8/9)y. Then du=8/9 dy. The integral becomes:\n\n(1/3) ∫₀¹ ( (8/9 y)^{-2/3} (1 -8/9 y)^{-5/6} )*(8/9) dy\n\n= (1/3)*(8/9)^{1 -2/3} ∫₀¹ y^{-2/3} (1 -8/9 y)^{-5/6} dy\n\n= (1/3)*(8/9)^{1/3} ∫₀¹ y^{-2/3} (1 -8/9 y)^{-5/6} dy\n\nBut this still doesn't resolve into a Beta function. Therefore, perhaps the key assumption is recognizing the integral after substitution as a form of the Beta function with certain parameters, despite the upper limit not being 1. However, in the user's transformed integral, the bounds are 0 to1, suggesting that the correct substitution maps the original integral to the Beta function integral with those bounds.\n\nWait, maybe there's a different substitution altogether. Let's start from the original integral:\n\n∫₀² dx / sqrt(1 +x³)\n\nLet’s set x = (1 - t)/t^{1/2}. Wait, that's just a guess. Alternatively, set x = 2t, then dx=2dt, and the integral becomes 2 ∫₀¹ dt / sqrt(1 +8t³). Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, set t = x^3/2^3, so x=2t^{1/3}. Then dx= (2/3) t^{-2/3} dt. The integral becomes:\n\n∫₀¹ (2/3) t^{-2/3} dt / sqrt(1 + (2t^{1/3})^3 )\n\n= (2/3) ∫₀¹ t^{-2/3} dt / sqrt(1 +8t)\n\n= (2/3) ∫₀¹ t^{-2/3} (1 +8t)^{-1/2} dt\n\nHmm, which is similar to the integral we had before. But still not matching the Beta form.\n\nWait, the user's transformed integral is (1/6)∫₀¹ x^{-2/3}(1 -x)^{-5/6} dx. Let’s compare this with the integral we have now: (2/3)∫₀¹ t^{-2/3} (1 +8t)^{-1/2} dt. If we can relate (1 +8t)^{-1/2} to (1 -x)^{-5/6} through a substitution. Let's set x = something.\n\nLet’s suppose we set x = 8t/(1 +8t). Then t = x/(8(1 -x)), dt= dx/(8(1 -x)^2). When t=0, x=0; t=1, x=8/9. Substitute into the integral:\n\n(2/3) ∫₀^{8/9} [ (x/(8(1 -x)))^{-2/3} ] * (1 +8*(x/(8(1 -x)))^{-1/2} * [ dx/(8(1 -x)^2) ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (2/3) * (8)^{-2/3} ∫₀^{8/9} x^{-2/3} (1 -x)^{2/3} * (1/(1 -x))^{-1/2} * (1/(8(1 -x)^2)) dx\n\n= (2/3) *8^{-2/3} *8^{-1} ∫₀^{8/9} x^{-2/3} (1 -x)^{2/3 +1/2 +2} dx\n\nWait, this seems messy and probably not helpful. I think I'm stuck here. Let's step back.\n\nThe key seems to be that after appropriate substitution, the integral reduces to a Beta function, and the user's transformed integral is exactly B(1/3,1/6)/6. Therefore, the assumptions should include the substitution steps that lead to this Beta function form. However, in the example, the assumptions were about the variable n. Here, the problem's assumptions might involve the substitution leading to the Beta function, but according to the user's example, each assumption is one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe substitution reduces the integral to a Beta function form with parameters 1/3 and 1/6,\nThe integral bounds after substitution are from 0 to 1,\nThe integrand after substitution is x^{-2/3}(1 - x)^{-5/6},\nThe factor from substitution scaling is 1/6.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were listed as properties of the variable (n is integer, n divisible by 7). Here, the problem is about an integral, so the assumptions would relate to the substitutions and integrand form. But the user's example had assumptions as conditions on the variable. Maybe here, the assumptions are the steps taken in the substitution leading to the Beta function. However, according to the example, each assumption should be a single condition applied to one object. Perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is transformed using substitution t = 1 + x³,\nThe bounds after substitution are adjusted from 1 to 9,\nThe integrand after substitution is expressed in terms of (t -1)^{-2/3} t^{-1/2},\nThe substitution u = (t -1)/8 maps the bounds to 0 to 1,\nThe integrand is expressed as a Beta function with parameters 1/3 and 1/6.\n\nBut the example's assumptions were more about the problem's conditions, not the solution steps. The original example's problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted assumptions were \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but 91=7*13, so perhaps the original problem required n to be divisible by both 7 and 13, but in the example, only 7 was mentioned. That seems inconsistent. So perhaps there was a mistake in the example. But regardless, the user wants us to list assumptions based on the problem's conditions, not the solution steps. In the current problem, the original question is to prove the integral equals the Gamma combination. The assumptions would be the conditions that make the integral solvable via Beta/Gamma functions. Since the integral's bounds and integrand form allow it to be expressed as a Beta function, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The integral from 0 to 2 can be transformed into an integral from 0 to 1.\n- The integrand after substitution matches the form of the Beta function integrand.\n- The parameters of the Beta function correspond to 1/3 and 1/6.\n\nBut according to the example's format, assumptions should be listed line by line, each as a single property or condition. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe substitution $t = 1 + x^3$ is applied,\nThe integral bounds after substitution are adjusted to $0$ and $1$,\nThe integrand can be expressed in terms of $x^{-2/3}(1 - x)^{-5/6}$,\nThe substitution introduces a scaling factor of $\\frac{1}{6}$.\n\nBut the example's assumptions were about the variable's properties, not substitutions. However, the original problem here doesn't state any explicit conditions except the integral itself. Therefore, maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond the integral's definition. But the example added an assumption (n divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem's statement. This is confusing. Maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Regardless, following the user's instruction to filter unrelated info and structure the problem with assumptions and the problem.\n\nThe original problem is to prove that ∫₀² dx/√(1 +x³) equals Γ(1/6)Γ(1/3)/(6Γ(1/2)). The key steps involve substitution to express the integral as a Beta function. The problem likely requires recognizing the integral as a Beta function, hence the assumptions would be the conditions that allow this recognition. However, since the example added assumptions not in the original problem, perhaps here the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral can be expressed in terms of the Beta function,\nThe parameters of the Beta function are $\\frac{1}{3}$ and $\\frac{1}{6}$,\nThe Beta function is related to the Gamma function via $B(a,b) = \\frac{\\Gamma(a)\\Gamma(b)}{\\Gamma(a+b)}$.\n\nBut the example's assumptions were about the problem's variables. Since this problem is an integral, perhaps the assumptions are about the substitution steps leading to the Beta function. However, the user's example didn't include solution steps as assumptions. This is tricky. Maybe the answer should list the substitution steps as assumptions, but according to the example, assumptions are conditions on the problem's variables. Since this integral doesn't have variables (it's a definite integral), maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond the integral's bounds and integrand form. Therefore, perhaps there are no assumptions, but the example shows that even if the original problem doesn't state assumptions, the formatted version might infer some. Alternatively, maybe the problem's assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is from 0 to 2,\nThe integrand is $1/\\sqrt{1 + x^3}$,\nThe solution involves the Beta and Gamma functions.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were properties of n. Since this problem doesn't involve variables with conditions, maybe it's better to list the key properties of the integral that allow it to be expressed via Gamma functions. However, the user's example included assumptions not stated in the original problem. Given this confusion, perhaps the correct approach is to follow the example's style. The example added an assumption (n divisible by 7) not present in the original problem's statement. Therefore, in this problem, perhaps list assumptions related to the substitutions made in the solution, even if not stated in the problem. For example:\n\nAssumption:\nA substitution transforms the integral bounds to 0 and 1,\nThe integrand after substitution is proportional to $x^{-2/3}(1 -x)^{-5/6}$,\nThe substitution introduces a factor of $\\frac{1}{6}$.\n\nBut these are steps in the solution, not assumptions. The user's example had assumptions about the variable, which were perhaps inferred from the problem's context (divisible by 7 to make 91=7*13). In this problem, the key is recognizing the integral as a Beta function, so maybe the assumption is that the integral can be expressed as a Beta function with specific parameters. However, in the example, the assumption was about the variable, not the method.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem doesn't state any conditions beyond the integral itself, maybe there are no assumptions, but the format requires listing assumptions. This is conflicting. The user's example shows that even if the original problem doesn't state assumptions, they were added (possibly incorrectly). Given that, perhaps here the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral $\\int_0^2 \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{1 + x^3}}$ converges,\nThe Beta function identity $B(a,b) = \\frac{\\Gamma(a)\\Gamma(b)}{\\Gamma(a+b)}$ holds,\nThe substitution $t = x^3 + 1$ is valid.\n\nBut I'm not sure. This is getting too into the solution rather than the problem's assumptions. Maybe the correct answer, following the example's approach, is to not list any assumptions beyond the integral's definition, but since the example added assumptions, perhaps here we need to infer from the problem's steps. The user's transformed integral has bounds 0 to1 and the integrand x^{-2/3}(1 -x)^{-5/6}, which is a Beta function. So the key substitution changes the bounds to 0 to1 and the integrand to that form. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe substitution transforms the integral bounds from 0 to 2 into 0 to 1,\nThe integrand after substitution is proportional to $x^{-2/3}(1 - x)^{-5/6}$,\nThe substitution introduces a factor of $\\frac{1}{6}$.\n\nBut again, these are solution steps, not problem conditions. The user's example had assumptions about the variable, not the method. Given the confusion, perhaps the safest way is to follow the example's style, listing conditions on the problem's elements. Since the integral's bounds are 0 to 2 and the integrand involves 1/sqrt(1 +x³), but the example had assumptions about n, perhaps here there are no explicit assumptions, and the problem is as stated. However, the user's example included an extra assumption not in the original problem. Maybe in this case, the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated over the interval [0, 2],\nThe integrand is $1/\\sqrt{1 + x^3}$.\n\nBut these are just restating the problem. The example added an extra assumption, so maybe we need to infer something. Alternatively, maybe the substitution step is considered an assumption. However, the user's instructions say to filter unrelated information and structure the problem. The original question includes the user's attempts at substitutions and mentions the transformed integral. The problem to prove the equality is given, and the formatted problem should list assumptions and the problem. Given that, perhaps the assumptions are the conditions under which the integral equals the Gamma combination, which involve the substitution leading to the Beta function. But how to phrase that as assumptions?\n\nAlternatively, given the example, maybe the assumptions are the key properties that make the integral solvable, like the exponents in the Beta function. But I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent and the confusion, I think the best approach is to list the substitution that maps the integral to the Beta function form as the assumption, even though it's part of the solution. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nThe substitution $t = 1 + x^3$ transforms the integral bounds from $[0, 2]$ to $[1, 9]$,\nThe integral after substitution can be expressed as a Beta function,\nThe Beta function parameters are $\\frac{1}{3}$ and $\\frac{1}{6}$.\n\nBut according to the example's format, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. Therefore, breaking it down:\n\nAssumption:\nThe substitution $t = 1 + x^3$ is applied,\nThe integral bounds after substitution are $1$ and $9$,\nThe integrand after substitution is proportional to $t^{-1/2}(t - 1)^{-2/3}$,\nA second substitution maps the bounds to $0$ and $1$,\nThe integrand after the second substitution matches the Beta function form $x^{-2/3}(1 - x)^{-5/6}$,\nThe substitution scaling factor is $\\frac{1}{6}$.\n\nBut this seems too detailed. The example had two assumptions: n is integer, n is divisible by7. Here, given the problem's complexity, perhaps list the necessary substitutions and conditions. But the user's example kept it concise. Maybe the answer should be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral $\\int_0^2 \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{1 + x^3}}$ can be transformed into a Beta function integral,\nThe Beta function parameters are $\\frac{1}{3}$ and $\\frac{1/6}$,\nThe substitution introduces a factor of $\\frac{1}{6}$.\n\nBut again, these are solution steps. I think the correct answer, following the example's style but adapting to this problem, is:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated from $0$ to $2$,\nThe integrand involves $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + x^3}}$,\nThe solution requires the Beta function with parameters $\\frac{1}{3}$ and $\\frac{1}{6}$.\n\nBut the example's assumptions were about the variable's properties. Since this integral doesn't have variables with conditions, perhaps there are no explicit assumptions, but the format requires listing them. Given the ambiguity, I'll proceed with the following assumptions based on the key steps needed to solve the problem, structured as one property per line:\n\nAssumption",
