    "Content": "Let $r$ be a natural number.  I wish to prove that $x + \\dfrac{x^2}{2} + \\dfrac{x^3}{3} + \\cdots + \\dfrac{x^r}{r} \\leq x^{r+1} + \\log(r+1)$ for all $x>0$. Some friends and I have tried using various calculus techniques but none of them seem to work. A solution or hint would be appreciated.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $f(x)=x^{r+1}+\\log(r+1)-\\sum_{i=1}^r{x^i/i}$. We need to show that $\\min_{x>0}f(x)>0$. Differentiate and set to $0$: $$f'(x)=(r+1)x^r-\\sum_{i=0}^{r-1}{x^i}=0$$ Clearly $f'(t)>0$ for $t\\geq 1$, so solution(s) for $f'(x)=0$ lies in $(0,1)$ (at least one exists since $f'(0)<0$ and $f'$is continuous). Use $x^r=\\sum_{i=0}^{r-1}{x^i}/(r+1)$, $x<1$ and telescoping product for $\\log$: $$f(x)=x^{r+1}+\\log(r+1)-\\sum_{i=1}^r{x^i/i}=x\\cdot(\\sum_{i=0}^{r-1}{x^i}/(r+1))+\\log(r+1)-\\sum_{i=1}^r{x^i/i}=\\sum_{i=1}^{r}x^i(1/(r+1)-1/i)+\\log(\\prod_{i=1}^r\\frac{1+i}{i})>\\sum_{i=1}^{r}(1/(r+1)-1/i)+\\sum_{i=1}^r\\log(1+1/i)=\\frac{r}{r+1}-\\sum_{i=1}^r\\big(1/i-\\log(1+1/i)\\big)>\\frac{r}{r+1}-\\gamma>0$$ for $r\\geq 2$ (where $\\gamma\\approx0.577$ is Euler–Mascheroni constant). Separately check the case $r=1$ to get $f(x)\\geq \\log(2)-1/4>0$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original question is about proving an inequality involving a series and a logarithmic term.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions. The problem states that r is a natural number and x is greater than 0. The user in the example split each assumption into separate lines, each addressing one property of a single object. So here, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. r is a natural number.\n2. x is a real number greater than 0.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"for all x > 0\", so x is a positive real number. The example had two assumptions: one about n being an integer and another about divisibility. In this case, the assumptions are on r and x. The problem is to prove the inequality given those conditions. \n\nThe problem statement itself is the inequality presented. So I need to make sure that the assumptions are correctly listed and the problem is restated properly. Let me check again. The original question says \"Let r be a natural number. I wish to prove that ... for all x > 0.\" So the two main assumptions are r ∈ ℕ and x > 0. Each should be on its own line. Then the problem is the inequality as given. \n\nI think that's all. There's no mention of any other conditions, like specific ranges for r beyond being natural, or restrictions on x beyond positivity. So the formatted problem should have those two assumptions and the inequality to prove.",
