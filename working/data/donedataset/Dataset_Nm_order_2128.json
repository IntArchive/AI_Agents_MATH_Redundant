    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into their specified format. The example they provided shows how assumptions and the problem are separated. The key is to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then, state the problem concisely.\n\nLooking at the original problem, the title mentions a conjectural closed-form of an infinite sum and some integral variations. The question itself lists three specific mathematical expressions: an infinite sum and two integrals, each equated to a combination of various mathematical constants and functions like polylogarithms, zeta functions, and logarithms. The user mentions these are related and wants help proving any of them, noting that the first is a conjecture by J.M. Borwein found via PSLQ. There's also an update mentioning Ali Shadhar's work on one integral and a method via integration by parts for another.\n\nSo, the task is to parse this into assumptions and the problem. The example given in the prompt for the divisibility problem listed assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7, then the problem statement. Here, the original problem doesn't state any explicit assumptions but presents three identities. The problem is to prove any of these identities. However, the user might consider the context as assumptions. But since the problem is to prove the given identities, the assumptions might not be conditions on variables but rather the given equalities. Wait, no, the assumptions in the example were conditions on the variables in the problem. But in this case, the problem is to prove those equalities. So perhaps there are no explicit assumptions here except the definitions of the terms involved. But the example included an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, which was part of the problem's original conditions.\n\nWait, the example had an original problem where the user restructured it to include an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But looking back, the original problem in the example was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted problem in the example added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that might be a mistake. Wait, the original example says the formatted problem's assumptions are n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But the original problem didn't mention that n must be divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like an error. Because the original problem was to prove for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, the assumption is that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, which would make the problem to prove divisibility by 91 under the assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be incorrect. But maybe that's part of the user's example. So perhaps the user's example is wrong, but they want me to follow that structure regardless.\n\nBut in this current problem, the user is presenting three identities. The problem is to prove any of them. The original problem's assumptions would be the conditions under which these identities hold. But the problem as stated doesn't specify any particular conditions; it just presents the equalities as conjectures or to be proven. So perhaps there are no explicit assumptions here. However, the problem mentions that the first identity is an unproved conjecture, and the others have been established through certain methods. The user is asking for help proving any of them.\n\nBut according to the format, the assumptions should list each condition line by line. If there are no explicit assumptions given in the problem (like restrictions on variables, domains, etc.), then perhaps the assumptions are inherent in the problem statements. For example, the sum from n=1 to infinity, the integrals from 0 to 1. So perhaps the assumptions are about the convergence of the series or the integrals. But the user's example didn't include that. Wait, in the example, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7, which was part of the problem's original statement. But the example given in the problem was a problem where the original problem's statement was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which is not in the original. That seems incorrect. So perhaps the user's example is flawed. But regardless, the task is to structure the current problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the user provided three equalities. The problem is to prove any of them. The assumptions would be the conditions required for these equalities to hold. However, since the problem statement doesn't mention any specific conditions beyond the standard (like convergence, domain of integration, etc.), perhaps the assumptions are implicit. But according to the example, even if the original problem didn't state an assumption, the formatted problem added it. Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. Then the problem becomes to prove divisibility by 91 under that assumption. But the original problem was for every integer n, so the assumption is just that n is an integer, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. But in the example, the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", which was not in the original problem. That seems like a mistake. Maybe the user made an error in their example.\n\nBut regardless, proceeding with the current problem. The problem is to prove any of the three given identities. The user mentions that the first is a conjecture, and they've established equivalence among the three but need help proving any. The integrals are from 0 to 1, and the sum is from n=1 to infinity. The functions involved are standard (polylogarithms, zeta functions, logs, etc.), so perhaps the assumptions are that these functions are defined in their standard domains. However, since the problem is to prove these equalities, perhaps the assumptions are the definitions of the terms. But according to the user's format, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. Since there's no explicit condition given in the problem, maybe there are no assumptions beyond the standard mathematical context. But the example included an assumption even when the original problem didn't state it, so perhaps here, we need to list the assumptions as the convergence of the series and the existence of the integrals. However, the problem as stated in the example didn't include convergence as an assumption. Alternatively, maybe the problem is presented as is, with the only assumption being that the series and integrals converge, which is necessary for the expressions to be valid. But how to phrase that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are no explicit assumptions here, so the assumptions section is empty. But the user's example shows that even when the problem is general, they add the assumption. Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is that n is an integer. Then the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. But in the example given by the user, the formatted problem added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7, which is incorrect. So maybe the user intended to include all the conditions mentioned in the problem. But in the current problem, there are no conditions specified beyond the variables in the integrals and sums. So perhaps there are no explicit assumptions. But the user's format requires listing assumptions. If there are none, but the example included some, maybe I need to infer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's context implies that the sum converges and the integrals are well-defined. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe infinite series $\\sum _{n=1}^{\\infty } \\frac{1}{n^4 2^n \\binom{3 n}{n}}$ converges.\nThe integral $\\int_0^1 \\frac{x \\text{Li}_2(x) \\log (1-x)}{x^2+1}dx$ is well-defined.\nThe integral $\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\text{Li}_2(x) \\log \\left(x^2-2 x+2\\right)}{x} dx$ is well-defined.\n\nBut I'm not sure if the user wants these as assumptions. Alternatively, maybe there are no assumptions because the problem is to prove the identities as stated, and the assumptions are inherent in the problem's context. But according to the example, even when the problem states \"for every integer n\", they listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So in this case, since the sum is from n=1 to infinity, maybe the assumption is that n is a positive integer. But the problem is about the sum, not about a general n. Wait, the sum is over n, so n is a summation index. The problem is to compute the sum. So perhaps no assumptions on n other than it's a summation variable. Similarly, the integrals are definite integrals from 0 to 1, so the variables are integrated out. Therefore, perhaps there are no assumptions needed here. But the user's format requires listing assumptions. Maybe the user expects that each object (the sum and the integrals) are to be considered under standard mathematical assumptions (like convergence), so each line in assumptions addresses one object.\n\nBut since the user's example included an assumption that n is an integer even when the problem states \"for every integer n\", perhaps in this case, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe series $\\sum _{n=1}^{\\infty } \\frac{1}{n^4 2^n \\binom{3 n}{n}}$ converges.\nThe integral $\\int_0^1 \\frac{x \\text{Li}_2(x) \\log (1-x)}{x^2+1}dx$ exists.\nThe integral $\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\text{Li}_2(x) \\log \\left(x^2-2 x+2\\right)}{x} dx$ exists.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's necessary. Alternatively, the problem may not require any assumptions beyond the definitions of the functions involved. The user's example might have been incorrect, but we have to follow their format. Since the example included an assumption even when the problem didn't state it (the divisibility by 7), which seems to be a mistake, but maybe in this case, since the problem is to prove these identities, and they are stated as equalities, the assumptions would be the mathematical context (like the functions are defined, the integrals converge, etc.), but how to phrase that concisely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem as given has no explicit assumptions, so the assumptions section is empty. But the user's example shows that even in such cases, assumptions are listed. Given that, perhaps the correct approach here is to note that the problem involves these mathematical objects (the sum, the integrals) and that their convergence/existence is assumed. Therefore, each line in the assumptions would address one object's convergence or existence. But since the user's example didn't include such for the series, maybe it's not required. Alternatively, the problem is to prove the equalities, so there are no conditions other than the expressions are as defined. Therefore, the assumptions section might be empty, but the user's format requires it. Since the example had assumptions, perhaps here we need to list that each of the expressions (the sum and the integrals) are well-defined. But how to phrase that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has no assumptions, and the user's example was incorrect. But following the example, we have to list assumptions. Since the problem mentions three separate identities, perhaps the assumptions are that each of these expressions (the sum and the integrals) are being considered in their standard contexts. But I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent, I think the safest way is to follow the structure as in the example. The example took a problem that said \"for every integer n\" and listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So here, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nThe sum $\\sum _{n=1}^{\\infty } \\frac{1}{n^4 2^n \\binom{3 n}{n}}$ is considered.\nThe integral $\\int_0^1 \\frac{x \\text{Li}_2(x) \\log (1-x)}{x^2+1}dx$ is considered.\nThe integral $\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\text{Li}_2(x) \\log \\left(x^2-2 x+2\\right)}{x} dx$ is considered.\n\nBut that's just restating the problem's components. Alternatively, since the problem is to prove these equalities, and the user wants assumptions listed as properties or conditions applied to one object, maybe each line refers to a part of the problem. However, since the example listed two assumptions for the same object (n), perhaps here each identity is an object. But this is unclear. Alternatively, the problem is to prove any of the three identities, so each identity is a separate problem. But the user's example had one problem with multiple assumptions. \n\nGiven the user's instruction, the task is to structure the problem as per the format. The original problem has three identities, and the user asks to prove any of them. However, the example combined multiple conditions into assumptions. Maybe the way to structure this is:\n\nAssumption:\nThe infinite series $\\sum _{n=1}^{\\infty } \\frac{1}{n^4 2^n \\binom{3 n}{n}}$ converges.\nThe integral $\\int_0^1 \\frac{x \\text{Li}_2(x) \\log (1-x)}{x^2+1}dx$ is well-defined.\nThe integral $\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\text{Li}_2(x) \\log \\left(x^2-2 x+2\\right)}{x} dx$ is well-defined.\nProblem: Prove any of the following identities: [then list the three equations]\n\nBut the user's example didn't list convergence as an assumption, even though it's necessary. Alternatively, the problem is to prove the identities as stated, so the assumptions are that the series and integrals exist, and the problem is to show their equality to the given expressions. But given the example's structure, perhaps the assumptions are the objects involved, each on a line. Alternatively, maybe there are no assumptions, and the problem is just as stated. But the format requires an Assumption section. \n\nAlternatively, since the problem mentions that the first identity is a conjecture found via PSLQ, and the others are established via certain methods, but the user needs help proving any, perhaps the assumptions are that these integrals and series are related, but that's vague.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed to structure the problem as follows:\n\nAssumption:\nThe series $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^4 2^n \\binom{3n}{n}$ is convergent.\nThe integrals $\\int_0^1 \\frac{x \\text{Li}_2(x) \\log(1-x)}{x^2+1} dx$ and $\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\text{Li}_2(x) \\log(x^2-2x+2)}{x} dx$ exist.\nProblem: Prove any of the stated identities involving the series and integrals as given.\n\nBut per the user's example, each assumption should address only one property applied to one object. So each line should be a separate assumption. Hence:\n\nAssumption:\nThe series $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^4 2^n \\binom{3n}{n}$ converges.\nThe integral $\\int_0^1 \\frac{x \\text{Li}_2(x) \\log(1-x)}{x^2+1} dx$ is well-defined.\nThe integral $\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\text{Li}_2(x) \\log(x^2-2x+2)}{x} dx$ is well-defined.\nProblem: Prove that any of the following equalities hold:\n1. $\\sum _{n=1}^{\\infty } \\frac{1}{n^4 2^n \\binom{3 n}{n}}=-2 \\pi  \\Im(\\text{Li}_3(1+i))-\\frac{21 \\text{Li}_4\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)}{2}-\\frac{57}{8} \\zeta (3) \\log (2)+\\frac{83 \\pi ^4}{480}-\\frac{23}{48}  \\log ^4(2)+\\frac{7}{12} \\pi ^2 \\log ^2(2)$\n2. $\\int_0^1 \\frac{x \\text{Li}_2(x) \\log (1-x)}{x^2+1}dx=\\frac{C^2}{2}-\\frac{1}{8} \\pi  C \\log (2)+\\frac{15 \\text{Li}_4\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)}{16}-\\frac{511 \\pi ^4}{46080}+\\frac{5 \\log ^4(2)}{128}-\\frac{7}{384} \\pi ^2 \\log ^2(2)$\n3. $\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\text{Li}_2(x) \\log \\left(x^2-2 x+2\\right)}{x} dx=\\frac{1}{2} \\pi  \\Im(\\text{Li}_3(1+i))+\\frac{5 \\text{Li}_4\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)}{8}+\\frac{35}{64} \\zeta (3) \\log (2)-\\frac{577 \\pi ^4}{23040}+\\frac{5 \\log ^4(2)}{192}-\\frac{1}{96} \\pi ^2 \\log ^2(2)$\n\nBut I need to ensure each assumption is a single property or condition applied to one object. The series and each integral are separate objects. Therefore, three assumptions: convergence of the series, existence of the first integral, and existence of the second integral. Then the problem is to prove any of the three equalities.\n\nI think this matches the required format. Each assumption is a single line, addressing one property (convergence/existence) of one object (the series, integral 1, integral 2). Then the problem is to prove any of the three identities. This follows the structure of the example, even though the example's assumptions were different. The key is to extract the conditions necessary for the problem to make sense, which here are the convergence and existence of the expressions involved.",
