    "Content": "How would you go about proving that $$\\gcd \\left(\\frac{a}{\\gcd (a,b)},\\frac{b}{\\gcd (a,b)}\\right)=1$$ for any two integers $a$ and $b$? Intuitively it is true because when you divide $a$ and $b$ by $\\gcd(a,b)$ you cancel out any common factors between them resulting in them becoming coprime. However, how would you prove this rigorously and mathematically?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Very simply it can be done like this: $\\gcd(a,b)=d$. Now we ask can: $\\gcd(\\frac{a}{d},\\frac{b}{d})=e$ for $e>1$? Well, this implies $e\\mid\\frac{a}{d},e\\mid\\frac{b}{d} \\Rightarrow em=\\frac{a}{d}, en=\\frac{b}{d} \\Rightarrow dem=a,den=b \\Rightarrow de$ is a common divisor of $a,b$ which is greater than $d$, thus a contradiction as $d$ by definition was supposed as the $\\gcd$. Hence, $e=1$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to work through this problem step by step. The problem is to prove that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a divided by the gcd of a and b, and b divided by the gcd of a and b is equal to 1. So, mathematically, we need to show that gcd(a/gcd(a,b), b/gcd(a,b)) = 1. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what gcd means. The gcd of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. So, if we have two numbers, say x and y, their gcd is the largest number that can divide both x and y. \n\nIn this problem, the two numbers in question are a divided by their gcd and b divided by their gcd. Let me denote d as the gcd of a and b. So, d = gcd(a, b). Then, the problem reduces to showing that gcd(a/d, b/d) = 1. \n\nNow, let me think about the properties of gcd. One important property is that if we divide two numbers by their gcd, the resulting numbers should be coprime. That makes intuitive sense because the gcd is the greatest common divisor, so by dividing each number by this, we remove all common factors. But I need to prove this rigorously.\n\nLet me set some variables to make this clearer. Let’s let d = gcd(a, b). Then, we can write a = d * m and b = d * n, where m and n are integers. Since d is the gcd, m and n should not have any common divisors other than 1. Wait, but is that automatically true? Let me check. If there was another common divisor of m and n, say k > 1, then d * k would be a common divisor of a and b, which would be larger than d. But that contradicts the fact that d is the greatest common divisor. Therefore, m and n must be coprime. \n\nSo, substituting back, a/d = m and b/d = n. Therefore, gcd(m, n) = 1. Hence, gcd(a/d, b/d) = 1. That seems straightforward. But maybe I need to present this more formally.\n\nAlternatively, I can approach this using the properties of gcd. Let’s denote d = gcd(a, b). Then, we know that a = d * a' and b = d * b', where gcd(a', b') = 1. Therefore, gcd(a/d, b/d) = gcd(a', b') = 1. That’s essentially the same argument.\n\nWait, but why exactly does gcd(a', b') have to be 1? Because if they had a common divisor greater than 1, say k, then d * k would be a common divisor of a and b greater than d, which contradicts the definition of d being the greatest common divisor. Therefore, there can be no such k, so a' and b' must be coprime.\n\nTherefore, the proof is complete. But maybe I need to write it step by step for clarity. Let me outline the steps:\n\n1. Let d = gcd(a, b).\n2. Then, a = d * a' and b = d * b', where a' and b' are integers.\n3. Suppose there exists an integer k > 1 such that k divides both a' and b'.\n4. Then, d * k would divide both a and b.\n5. Since k > 1, d * k > d, which contradicts the fact that d is the greatest common divisor of a and b.\n6. Therefore, no such k exists, so gcd(a', b') = 1.\n7. Hence, gcd(a/d, b/d) = 1.\n\nThis seems like a solid proof. Alternatively, another approach might use the Bézout's identity or properties of linear combinations, but this contradiction approach seems straightforward.\n\nLet me verify this with an example. Suppose a = 12 and b = 18. Then, gcd(12, 18) = 6. Then, a/gcd(a,b) = 12/6 = 2 and b/gcd(a,b) = 18/6 = 3. The gcd of 2 and 3 is indeed 1. Another example: a = 21, b = 35. gcd(21,35)=7. Then 21/7=3 and 35/7=5. gcd(3,5)=1. Seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, the key idea is that dividing both numbers by their gcd removes all common factors, making the resulting numbers coprime. The proof relies on the definition of gcd and contradiction if there were a common factor remaining.",
