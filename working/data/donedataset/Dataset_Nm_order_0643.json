    "Content": "Let $F_0, F_1, F_2, \\ldots$ be the Fibonacci numbers, defined by $F_0 = 0$, $F_1 = 1$ and $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$ for all $n\\geq 2$. In this question Oleg567 conjectured the following interesting fact about Fibonacci numbers:\n$$ k\\mid F_n\\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad k^d\\mid F_{k^{d-1}n} $$\nwhere $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\nThis can be regarded as an analogue of Hensel's lifting lemma. I would be glad to give a proof (following the share your knowledge, Q&A-style), based on a simple combinatorial identity, and see if others come out with more elegant ones.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Step 1. Since, by the Binet formula,\n$$ F_n = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}\\left(\\sigma^n-\\bar{\\sigma}^n\\right), $$\nwhere $\\sigma+\\bar{\\sigma}=1$ and $\\sigma\\bar{\\sigma}=-1$, we have:\n$$ F_m \\mid F_{mn}, $$\nsince in $\\mathbb{Z}[x,y]$ the polynomial $x^m-y^m$ divides the polynomial $x^{mn}-y^{mn}$. Step 2. We can prove our statement by assuming without loss of generality that $k$ is a prime power. The Chinese theorem in conjunction with Step 1 grants that if the statement holds when $k$ is a prime power, then it holds for every integer. Step 3. The Pisano period for the Fibonacci and Lucas sequences $\\!\\!\\pmod{2}$ is $3$. In particular, $F_n$ (as well as $L_n$) is even iff $n$ is a multiple of $3$. Moreover,\n$$ F_{2n} = F_n \\cdot L_n.$$ Step 4. By assuming that $2^h\\mid F_n$ we have $n=3m$ in virtue of Step 3, and:\n$$ F_{2^{(d-1)h}n} = F_{2^{(d-1)h}3m} = F_{2^{(d-1)h-1}3m}L_{2^{(d-1)h-1}3m} = F_{3m}\\cdot\\prod_{j=0}^{(d-1)h-1}L_{3\\cdot 2^j m}, $$\nso:\n$$ \\nu_2(F_{2^{(d-1)h}n})\\geq \\nu_2(F_{n}) + (d-1)h \\geq dh,$$\nsince every term in the product is even. So we just proved the statement in case that $k$ is a power of $2$. Step 5. We assume now that $k$ is odd. Since $\\frac{x^l-y^l}{x-y}=\\sum_{j=0}^{l-1} x^j y^{l-1-j}$, we have:\n$$\\frac{F_{kn}}{F_n}=\\sum_{j=0}^{k-1} \\sigma^{jn}\\bar{\\sigma}^{(k-1-j)n}=(-1)^{\\frac{k-1}{2}n}+\\sum_{j=0}^{\\frac{k-1}{2}} (-1)^{jn} L_{(k-1-2j)n},$$\nwhere $L_a = \\sigma^a + \\bar{\\sigma}^a$. If now we use the identity:\n$$ L_{2a} = \\sigma^{2a}+\\bar{\\sigma}^{2a} = 5 F_a^2 + 2(-1)^a$$\nwe get:\n$$\\frac{F_{kn}}{F_n}= (-1)^{\\frac{k-1}{2}n}+\\sum_{j=0}^{\\frac{k-1}{2}} (-1)^{jn}\\left(5 F_{\\left(\\frac{k-1}{2}-j\\right)n}^2+2(-1)^{\\left(\\frac{k-1}{2}-j\\right)n}\\right).$$\nSince $F_n$ divides $F_{mn}$ and $k$ divides $F_{n}$, the last sum $\\pmod{k}$ is just:\n$$ \\frac{F_{kn}}{F_n}\\equiv (-1)^{\\frac{k-1}{2}n}+\\sum_{j=0}^{\\frac{k-1}{2}}2(-1)^{\\frac{k-1}{2}n}\\equiv k (-1)^{\\frac{k-1}{2}n}\\equiv 0\\pmod{k}.$$\nHence we have that $k\\mid F_n$ implies $(k F_n)\\mid F_{kn}$, and our claim follows by induction.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The original question is about Fibonacci numbers and a conjecture related to Hensel's lifting lemma.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem defines the Fibonacci sequence with F₀=0, F₁=1, and the recurrence relation Fₙ = Fₙ₋₁ + Fₙ₋₂ for n ≥ 2. So that's three assumptions right there. Then, the conjecture states that if k divides Fₙ, then k^d divides F_{k^{d-1}n}. The variables here are k and n, which are natural numbers. So I need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nWait, the problem says k and n are in natural numbers. So maybe split that into two assumptions: k is a natural number, n is a natural number. Also, the Fibonacci sequence is defined with F₀=0, F₁=1, and the recurrence. Each of these is a separate assumption. Let me check the example given. In the example, assumptions were split into different lines, each for one condition. So yes, each part of the Fibonacci definition is a separate assumption.\n\nNow, the problem statement is to prove that if k divides Fₙ, then k^d divides F_{k^{d-1}n} for natural numbers k, n, and d. The original title mentions Hensel lifting, but the user wants to filter unrelated information. So the problem statement should be concise, just the implication to prove.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumptions:\n- F₀ = 0,\n- F₁ = 1,\n- For all n ≥ 2, Fₙ = Fₙ₋₁ + Fₙ₋₂,\n- k is a natural number,\n- n is a natural number.\n\nProblem: Prove that if k divides Fₙ, then k^d divides F_{k^{d−1}n} for any natural number d.\n\nWait, the original conjecture is written as k | F_n implies k^d | F_{k^{d-1}n}. So in the problem statement, we need to specify that this holds for any d in natural numbers? The problem states \"where k ∈ ℕ and n ∈ ℕ,\" but d is also a natural number. So maybe the assumptions should include d as a natural number as well. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe problem statement by Oleg567 is: k divides F_n implies k^d divides F_{k^{d-1}n} where k and n are natural numbers. The variable d isn't specified, but in the conjecture, d is used as an exponent. The user might be implying that d is a positive integer as well. So perhaps d is a natural number. Therefore, the assumptions should include that d is a natural number.\n\nSo revised assumptions:\n- F₀ = 0,\n- F₁ = 1,\n- For all n ≥ 2, Fₙ = Fₙ₋₁ + Fₙ₋₂,\n- k is a natural number,\n- n is a natural number,\n- d is a natural number.\n\nProblem: Prove that if k divides Fₙ, then k^d divides F_{k^{d−1}n}.\n\nYes, that seems right. Each assumption is a single line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. The problem is then the implication to prove.",
