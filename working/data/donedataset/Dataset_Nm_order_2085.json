    "Content": "I need to show two parts of the implication are true. \nFirst: if $A$ is $2\\times 2$ and is symmetric positive definite then $trace(A)>0$ and $\\det(A)>0$. Second: if $trace(A)>0$ and $\\det(A)>0$ then $A$ is symmetric positive definite. For the first part I was thinking: $A$ is symmetric and positive definite then $A$ has its eigenvalues positive. If $A$ is $2\\times 2$  then characteristic polynomial of $A$ is\n $x^2−x.trace(A)+\\det(A)=0$  If we compute the discriminant we get $(tr(A))^2 ≥ 4.\\det(A)$ \nNow $tr(A)$ is squared so it is positive. How do I know that $\\det(A)$ is also positive? After copper.hat's response we argue that the eigenvalues of A are all positive because $A$ is spsd and the $\\det(A)$ is the product of its eigenvalues. Thus $\\det(A)$ is strictly positive. Now, how do I verify the second part? Thanks.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The classification of symmetric $2\\times 2$ real matrices (or bilinear symmetric $2$-forms, or quadratic $2$-forms) through trace and determinant can be obtained in different ways, depending on the machinery one accepts. From more to less: 1) Spectral theorem. Then one knows the classification is done through eigenvalues. For instance positive semidefinite means two positive eigenvalues $\\lambda>0,\\mu>0$, which is equivalent to $\\lambda\\cdot\\mu>0,\\,\\lambda+\\mu>0$, that is determinant and trace both positive. Honestly, I think that for $2\\times 2$ matrices this is too heavy. 2) Canonical forms. Any symmetric $2\\times 2$ real matrix $A$ is equivalent to one of the following five canonical forms \n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\\\0&1\\end{pmatrix},\\,\n\\begin{pmatrix}-1&0\\\\0&-1\\end{pmatrix},\\,\n\\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\\\0&0\\end{pmatrix},\\,\n\\begin{pmatrix}-1&0\\\\0&0\\end{pmatrix},\\,\n\\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\\\0&-1\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThe matrix $A$ shares with its canonical form the sign of the determinant (including being $0$). Thus we see that $\\det>0$ immediately gives $A$ definite, and it remains to distinguish whether $A$ is positive or negative. In any case, the two entries in the diagonal of $A$ have the same sign, hence the sign of their sum, which is the trace of $A$. Thus $\\det(A)>0$, tr$(A)>0$ means positive definite. 3) Nothing. In other words just from the definition. Let $A=\n\\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\\\b&c\\end{pmatrix}$. Then the corresponding quadratic form is\n$q(x,y)=ax^2+2bxy+cy^2$, and we have to study the sign variations of this function for $(x,y)\\ne(0,0)$. For instance\n$f(x,0)=ax^2>0$ if and only if $a>0$. Then if $y\\ne0$ we can write:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{y^2}q(x,y)=at^2+2bt+c=P(t),\\quad t=\\frac{x}{y},\n$$\nand we discuss the signs of $P(t)$. For $t$ big enough, $P(t)>0$, since $a>0$. Then $P(t)>0$ for all $t$ means the polinomial has no zero, that is, its discriminant is negative, which gives\n$$\n0>\\varDelta=b^2-ac=-\\det(A).\n$$ \nAnd we get the condition $\\det(A)>0$. Thinking this over one realizes this characterizes being positive semidefinite (that is, is a back and forth argument). And trace? Since $0<\\det=ac-b^2$, and $a>0$, necessarily $c>0$ and trace$=a+c>0$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about proving that a 2x2 matrix A is symmetric positive definite (SPD) if and only if it's symmetric, has a trace greater than 0, and determinant greater than 0.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions line by line. Each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. \n\nLooking at the problem, the \"if and only if\" statement has two directions. For the first part (A is SPD implies trace>0 and det>0), the assumptions would be that A is a 2x2 matrix, A is symmetric, and A is positive definite. Then the problem is to show trace and determinant are positive. \n\nFor the converse (if A is symmetric, trace>0, det>0, then A is SPD), the assumptions are A is 2x2, symmetric, trace(A) > 0, and det(A) > 0. The problem is to show A is SPD. \n\nWait, but the user's example combined both directions into one problem statement. Let me check the example again. The example had the problem stated as proving divisibility under certain assumptions. Here, the problem is an equivalence, so maybe the assumptions should list all the conditions for each direction? Hmm, the user's instruction says to filter unrelated info and structure as per the format. The original question mentions showing two parts of the implication. So perhaps the problem is split into two parts, but the user's example combined into one problem statement. Let me see how the example was formatted. The example had the assumption list \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\" but the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7. Wait, maybe the example was modified. Wait, no—the original problem in the example was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. Then the formatted assumption added that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like an error. Because 91 is 7*13, so maybe the problem was to show divisibility by 91 when n is divisible by both 7 and 13? But the original example's formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\", but the original problem says \"for every integer n\". Hmm, perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user wants the assistant to follow their format regardless. \n\nIn the current problem, the user's original question is to show that a 2x2 matrix A is SPD iff it's symmetric, trace>0, det>0. The problem includes two directions. So when structuring, the assumptions would be:\n\nFor the first direction (SPD implies trace>0 and det>0), the assumptions are:\n- A is a 2x2 matrix.\n- A is symmetric.\n- A is positive definite.\n\nProblem: Prove that trace(A) > 0 and det(A) > 0.\n\nFor the converse direction (if symmetric, trace>0, det>0, then SPD), the assumptions are:\n- A is a 2x2 matrix.\n- A is symmetric.\n- trace(A) > 0.\n- det(A) > 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that A is positive definite.\n\nBut the user wants the problem structured as a single problem with assumptions and the problem statement. However, the original problem is an equivalence, so the combined problem would have the two parts. However, looking at the example, the user combined the problem into one statement. Let me check the example again. The example's original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption included n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but the original didn't mention divisibility by 7. Wait, that seems inconsistent. Maybe there was a mistake in the example. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to restructure the problem by extracting the necessary assumptions. \n\nWait, perhaps in the example, the original problem's assumption was that n is an integer, and the conclusion is divisibility by 91. But the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. However, that might not be correct. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the example. \n\nBut regardless, following the current problem, the user wants to structure the Math Stack Exchange question into the given format. The original question is to show the equivalence. So the problem statement would be: \"Show that a 2x2 matrix A is symmetric positive definite if and only if A is symmetric, trace(A) > 0, and det(A) > 0.\" The assumptions would then list the conditions for each direction. However, since it's an equivalence, the problem is to show both implications. But the user's example structured the problem with assumptions and problem. So in this case, the assumptions would be:\n\nFor the entire problem, the assumptions are:\n- A is a 2x2 matrix.\n- For the forward direction: A is symmetric and positive definite.\n- For the reverse direction: A is symmetric, trace(A) > 0, det(A) > 0.\n\nBut the user's format requires each assumption to apply to one object. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps split into two separate problems. But the original question is a single problem with two parts. \n\nWait, the user's example had the original problem as proving for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem changed it to assume n is divisible by 7. But that's incorrect because 91 is 7*13. So perhaps the example is flawed. But the user's instruction is to follow their format regardless. So for the current problem, how to structure it?\n\nThe problem is to show that A is SPD iff it's symmetric, trace>0, det>0. So the problem statement would be: \"Show that a 2x2 matrix A is symmetric positive definite if and only if A is symmetric, trace(A) > 0, and det(A) > 0.\"\n\nThen the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- A is a 2x2 matrix.\n- For the first implication (SPD implies trace and det positive):\n   - A is symmetric.\n   - A is positive definite.\n- For the second implication (trace and det positive implies SPD):\n   - A is symmetric.\n   - trace(A) > 0.\n   - det(A) > 0.\n\nBut the user's format says each assumption addresses only one property or condition applied to one object. So each condition on A is a separate line. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n- A is a 2x2 matrix.\n- A is symmetric.\n- A is positive definite. (for the first part)\n- trace(A) > 0. (for the second part)\n- det(A) > 0. (for the second part)\n\nBut this mixes assumptions for different parts. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is split into two separate problems. But the original question is a single problem with two implications. The user's example didn't split the problem, so perhaps we need to list all assumptions applicable. Wait, but in the example, the original problem was for all integers n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. So perhaps the user wants to extract the necessary conditions from the problem. But in this case, the problem is an equivalence, so the assumptions would vary depending on the direction. However, the user's format requires a single list of assumptions and a single problem statement. Therefore, perhaps the problem is stated as the equivalence, and the assumptions are the general conditions. But the problem is to show the equivalence, so the assumptions would be that A is a 2x2 matrix, and the problem is to show that A is SPD iff symmetric, trace>0, det>0. But that doesn't fit the example format. Alternatively, the problem is to prove each direction with respective assumptions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are:\n\nFor the entire problem, the overarching assumption is that A is a 2x2 matrix. Then, for each part, the specific assumptions. But the user's example had two assumptions: n is an integer, n divisible by 7, and the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. The original problem was for all integers, but the formatted problem added the divisibility by 7. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe there's a mistake in the example. \n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps for the current problem, the correct way is:\n\nAssumption:\n- A is a 2x2 matrix.\n- For the first part: A is symmetric and positive definite.\n- For the second part: A is symmetric, trace(A) > 0, and det(A) > 0.\n\nBut the user wants each assumption to address one property. So separate them:\n\nAssumption:\n- A is a 2x2 matrix.\n- A is symmetric.\n- A is positive definite. (for the first part)\n- trace(A) > 0. (for the second part)\n- det(A) > 0. (for the second part)\n\nProblem: Show that if A is symmetric positive definite, then trace(A) > 0 and det(A) > 0; and conversely, if A is symmetric, trace(A) > 0, and det(A) > 0, then A is positive definite.\n\nBut perhaps the problem statement can be written concisely as the equivalence.\n\nAlternatively, since the example combined both directions into one problem statement, perhaps here it's acceptable. \n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n- A is a 2x2 matrix.\n- A is symmetric.\n- For the first implication: A is positive definite.\n- For the second implication: trace(A) > 0.\n- For the second implication: det(A) > 0.\n\nProblem: Show that A is symmetric positive definite if and only if trace(A) > 0 and det(A) > 0.\n\nBut the user's example had the problem statement incorporate the assumptions. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, making the problem to prove under that assumption. So perhaps in this case, the assumptions are that A is a 2x2 matrix, symmetric, and then for each direction, the respective conditions. But perhaps it's better to split into two problems. However, the user's instruction says to structure the problem as per the example, which combined both directions into one problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is phrased as two separate problems. But the original question is a single problem. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the problem is an equivalence, the assumptions are the general ones needed for both directions. But that's not straightforward. \n\nWait, the problem is to show that for a 2x2 matrix A, A is SPD iff it's symmetric, trace>0, and det>0. So the problem combines both directions. Therefore, the assumptions would be that A is a 2x2 matrix. Then, the problem is to show the equivalence. But in the example, the assumptions included specific conditions (n is integer, divisible by 7), which were not all in the original problem. So perhaps here, the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\n- A is a 2x2 matrix.\n- A is symmetric.\n- For the first part: A is positive definite.\n- For the second part: trace(A) > 0.\n- For the second part: det(A) > 0.\n\nProblem: Show that A is symmetric positive definite if and only if trace(A) > 0 and det(A) > 0.\n\nBut the problem statement should encapsulate the entire equivalence. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\n- A is a 2x2 matrix.\n- A is symmetric.\n- A is positive definite (for the first part).\n- trace(A) > 0 (for the second part).\n- det(A) > 0 (for the second part).\n\nBut each assumption is listed line by line. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n- A is a 2x2 matrix.\n- A is symmetric.\n- For the first implication, A is positive definite.\n- For the second implication, trace(A) > 0.\n- For the second implication, det(A) > 0.\n\nProblem: Show that A is symmetric positive definite if and only if trace(A) > 0 and det(A) > 0.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is about equivalence, maybe the assumptions are just that A is a 2x2 matrix and symmetric, and the problem is to show that positive definite is equivalent to trace and det being positive. But the original problem's title says \"A is symmetric positive definite if and only if A is symmetric, trace(A) > 0 and det(A) > 0\". So the symmetry is part of the equivalence. So the problem assumes A is a 2x2 matrix, and the equivalence is between being symmetric positive definite and being symmetric with trace and det positive. \n\nWait, the title states: \"Show that a 2x2 matrix A is symmetric positive definite if and only if A is symmetric, trace(A) > 0 and det(A) > 0\". Therefore, the problem is to show that A (which is a 2x2 matrix) is SPD iff A is symmetric, trace>0, and det>0. So the \"A is symmetric\" is part of the equivalence. So in the SPD definition, A must already be symmetric, so the first direction assumes A is SPD (hence symmetric) and shows trace and det are positive. The converse assumes A is symmetric, trace>0, det>0, and shows SPD. \n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nFor the first implication (SPD implies trace>0 and det>0):\n- A is a 2x2 matrix.\n- A is symmetric positive definite.\n\nProblem part 1: Prove that trace(A) > 0 and det(A) > 0.\n\nFor the second implication (symmetric + trace>0 + det>0 implies SPD):\n- A is a 2x2 matrix.\n- A is symmetric.\n- trace(A) > 0.\n- det(A) > 0.\n\nProblem part 2: Prove that A is positive definite.\n\nBut the user wants a single problem statement. The example combined two parts into one problem. So perhaps the problem is stated as the equivalence, with assumptions split accordingly. But how to list assumptions? Since the equivalence includes both directions, the assumptions would need to cover all cases. But each assumption line should apply to one object and one property. \n\nAlternatively, the problem is structured as:\n\nAssumption:\n- A is a 2x2 matrix.\n- For the first implication: A is symmetric positive definite.\n- For the second implication: A is symmetric.\n- For the second implication: trace(A) > 0.\n- For the second implication: det(A) > 0.\n\nProblem: Show that A is symmetric positive definite if and only if the trace and determinant of A are positive.\n\nBut the original problem's title includes \"A is symmetric\" as part of the equivalence. So the problem is to show that being SPD (which requires symmetry) is equivalent to being symmetric with trace and det positive. Therefore, the assumptions for the first part are A is SPD (hence symmetric), and for the converse, A is symmetric with trace and det positive. \n\nBut how to structure this into the format? The user's example listed assumptions line by line. So for this problem:\n\nAssumption:\n- A is a 2x2 matrix.\n- For the first implication: A is symmetric positive definite.\n- For the second implication: A is symmetric.\n- For the second implication: trace(A) > 0.\n- For the second implication: det(A) > 0.\n\nProblem: Show that A is symmetric positive definite if and only if A is symmetric, trace(A) > 0, and det(A) > 0.\n\nBut the problem statement repeats the assumptions. However, in the example, the problem statement included the assumptions. For instance, in the example, the formatted problem's problem statement was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, given the assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But the original problem was for every integer n. So perhaps the user wants the problem statement to include the necessary conditions, even if they are part of the assumptions. \n\nIn this case, the problem statement would be: \"Show that a 2x2 matrix A is symmetric positive definite if and only if A is symmetric, trace(A) > 0, and det(A) > 0.\" The assumptions list the conditions for each direction. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- A is a 2x2 matrix.\n- For the first implication: A is symmetric positive definite.\n- For the second implication: A is symmetric.\n- For the second implication: trace(A) > 0.\n- For the second implication: det(A) > 0.\n\nProblem: Show that A is symmetric positive definite if and only if A is symmetric, trace(A) > 0, and det(A) > 0.\n\nThis way, the assumptions list the prerequisites for each direction, and the problem states the equivalence. Each assumption is a single line, addressing one property. However, the problem statement includes the conditions as part of the equivalence. This seems to fit the example provided, where the problem statement includes conditions that were part of the assumptions. \n\nTherefore, this should be the correct formatting.",
