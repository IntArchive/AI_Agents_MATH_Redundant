    "Content": "In reading about A polarization identity for multilinear maps by Erik G F  Thomas , I am led to prove the following combinatorial identity, which I cannot find anywhere, nor do I have any idea how to prove it. $$\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^k(-1)^{k-j}j^k\\binom{k}{j}=k!.$$\nAfter some reductions (including $\\binom{k+1}{j}=\\binom{k}{j}+\\binom{k}{j-1}$) and \"simplifications\", I am still stuck and have no clues how to proceed. I do not know if this is true, either, though I think it should be. Any help or reference is sincerely welcomed, thanks in advance.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $L$ be the collection of sequences indexed by $\\mathbb{N}$ taking values in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n$$L = \\{ (x_0, x_1, x_2, \\ldots ) : x_i \\in \\mathbb{R} \\}$$\n$L$ will be a vector space with respect to componentwise addition and scalar multiplication. Define a linear map $D$ on $L$ by\n$$L \\ni x = (x_0, x_1, x_2, \\ldots ) \\quad\\mapsto\\quad Dx = (x_1, x_2, \\ldots ) \\in L$$\nThe result of applying $D - 1$ to a sequence $x$ is the finite difference of $x$.\n$$\\left[ (D-1)x \\right]_n = x_{n+1} - x_n$$ If you apply $(D-1)^k$ to the sequence $u = (n^k)_{n=0}^\\infty$, you will find $$\\left[ (D-1)^k u \\right]_n\n= \\sum_{j=0}^{k}(-1)^{k-j}\\binom{k}{j} \\left[D^j u\\right]_n\n= \\sum_{j=0}^{k}(-1)^{k-j}\\binom{k}{j} u_{n+j}\n= \\sum_{j=0}^{k}(-1)^{k-j}\\binom{k}{j}(j+n)^k\n$$\nWhen $n = 0$, this is the LHS of the equality at hand. To see LHS of your equality is indeed equal to the RHS, you can use following fact: If $v$ is a sequence whose value is a polynomial in the index $n$, i.e.\n  $$v_n = a_p n^p + a_{p-1} n^{p-1} + \\cdots + a_0$$\n  for some constants $a_p, a_{p-1},\\ldots, a_0$, the \n  finite difference of $v$ will be a polynomial in $n$ with degree one less.\n  Furthermore, the leading coefficient is multiplied by a factor $p$. i.e.\n  $$\\left[(D-1)v\\right]_n = p a_p n^{p-1} + \\cdots$$ Apply these $k$ times to the sequence $u = (n^k)_{n=0}^\\infty$, you find \n$$\\sum_{j=0}^{k}(-1)^{k-j}\\binom{k}{j}(j+n)^k = \\left[ (D-1)^k u \\right]_n  = (D-1)^k n^k = k! n^0 = k!$$\nwhich is a constant independent of $n$ and equal to RHS of the equality at hand.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should list each condition applied to one object, and then the problem statement. \n\nLooking at the original problem: the user is asking to prove the combinatorial identity ∑_{j=1}^k (-1)^{k-j} j^k C(k,j) = k! where C(k,j) is the binomial coefficient. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that this is a combinatorial identity, and the variables involved are j and k. The summation runs from j=1 to j=k, with terms involving (-1)^{k-j}, j^k, binomial coefficients, and the result should be k factorial.\n\nNow, the assumptions. The example given in the problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. However, in this current problem, the original question doesn't explicitly state any conditions on k except that it's an integer since we're talking about binomial coefficients and factorials. Typically, binomial coefficients C(k,j) are defined for non-negative integers k and j with j ≤ k. So the variables here are integers, and the summation is over j from 1 to k. \n\nSo the key assumptions here are that k is a positive integer (since j starts at 1 and goes to k, k must be at least 1), and each term in the summation involves integers j and k. However, the problem as stated doesn't specify any restrictions beyond the implicit ones in the binomial coefficient. Therefore, the main assumption is that k is a positive integer. The problem doesn't mention any divisibility or other conditions, so the assumptions should probably just state that k is a positive integer.\n\nWait, the example included an assumption about divisibility by 7, but in this case, there's no such condition. The problem is a general identity for all positive integers k. So the assumption here is simply that k is a positive integer. Each assumption line should address only one property applied to one object. So \"k is a positive integer\" covers the necessary condition here. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list the assumption that k is a positive integer, and the problem is to prove the given summation equals k!.\n\nI need to check if there are any other implicit assumptions. For example, the binomial coefficient C(k,j) requires that k and j are non-negative integers with j ≤ k. Since the summation is from j=1 to k, j is at least 1 and at most k, so k must be at least 1. So the only explicit assumption needed is that k is a positive integer. There's no mention of any other constraints in the original problem. The user is just trying to prove the identity holds for all positive integers k. \n\nSo the Assumption line should be \"k is a positive integer.\" Then the problem is the sum equals k!.\n\nI think that's all. The example had two assumptions, but here, there's only one necessary assumption. Let me make sure there's no other hidden condition. The problem states \"for j=1 to k\", so k must be at least 1. So the only assumption is that k is a positive integer. The problem statement is the equation given. So the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nk is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^k(-1)^{k-j}j^k\\binom{k}{j}=k!.$$",
