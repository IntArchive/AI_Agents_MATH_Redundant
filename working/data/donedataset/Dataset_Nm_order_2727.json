    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. The example provided shows that the original problem had some assumptions and the problem statement. The task is to extract the assumptions and the problem from the given question.\n\nLooking at the example, they took the original problem about proving divisibility by 91 and listed assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Then the problem statement was rephrased. \n\nNow, the user provided the Math Stack Exchange question here. The title is about the difference between A ∈ B and A ⊂ B for proofs. The question has two parts: first proving that if A is a subset of B and B is a subset of C, then A is a subset of C. The second part is proving that if A is an element of B and B is an element of C, then A is an element of C. The user is confused about how to approach the second proof, especially translating it into logical symbols.\n\nSo, applying the format. The problem is to prove two statements. The first one is about subsets, the second about membership. The assumptions for each part need to be listed. For the first problem: A ⊂ B and B ⊂ C. For the second: A ∈ B and B ∈ C. Each assumption per line. Then the problem statements for each part. But wait, in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the problem. But in this case, the assumptions are the given conditions for each proof. The user has to structure the problem by listing each assumption line by line.\n\nWait, the example had \"Assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But in the original problem, the problem was to prove for every integer n (without divisibility by 7). So maybe the example had a mistake? Wait, no, the example's original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, the assumptions included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems conflicting. Because the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7, but the formatted problem added it. Hmm, maybe the example had a mistake, but perhaps the user wants the assumptions as per the problem's conditions. But in the example, the problem statement in the formatted version says \"Prove that A(n)... is divisible by 91\" with assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So perhaps there's a misunderstanding there, but maybe the example was incorrect. However, the user wants us to follow their structure regardless.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's question is about proving two statements: one involving subsets and the other involving membership. The user is confused about the second proof. So the problem is split into two parts. Let's parse the original question.\n\nOriginal Question:\n\"I have to prove a few different statements. The first is if A ⊂ B and B ⊂ C then prove A ⊂ C. This one is fairly straight forward, but I'm stuck on how the next one differs. Prove that if A ∈ B and B ∈ C then A ∈ C. I don't really understand how to put this in logical symbols. I've only seen a ∈ A written out but never 'a set A is an element of a set B'. Here's what I have for a proof at this point, assuming I understand what 'a set A is an element of a set B' means: suppose A ∈ B and B ∈ C. Then A ∈ C.\"\n\nSo the two problems here are:\n\n1. If A ⊂ B and B ⊂ C, then prove A ⊂ C.\n2. If A ∈ B and B ∈ C, then prove A ∈ C.\n\nEach has its own set of assumptions.\n\nFor the first problem:\nAssumptions: A is a subset of B, B is a subset of C.\n\nProblem: Prove A is a subset of C.\n\nFor the second problem:\nAssumptions: A is an element of B, B is an element of C.\n\nProblem: Prove A is an element of C.\n\nBut the user wants each assumption line by line. So each assumption is a single line. So for the first problem, two assumptions: A ⊂ B, B ⊂ C. Then the problem is to prove A ⊂ C. Similarly for the second.\n\nBut wait, the user's example had two assumptions for the first problem. So in the problem statement, each condition given in the \"if\" part is an assumption.\n\nTherefore, for each problem, list the assumptions line by line, then the problem.\n\nBut in the original problem, the user is asking about two separate proofs. So perhaps each proof is a separate problem. But the example's structure has one problem. So maybe we need to structure each as a separate problem? But the user's example combined the problem into one. Wait, the example's problem was a single problem with two assumptions. Here, the user's question has two distinct problems. So perhaps we need to present them as two separate problems, each with their own assumptions and problem statements.\n\nBut the user's instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\". The original question includes two problems. So maybe we need to list both in the formatted output. However, the example only showed a single problem. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem listed assumptions as \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the original problem, n is any integer, not necessarily divisible by 7. So perhaps the example had an error. Maybe the original problem had n divisible by 7? Or maybe the user made a mistake. But regardless, in the current problem, we need to follow the structure.\n\nBut the current problem from the user is two separate proofs. So perhaps the formatted problem should list each with their own assumptions and problem. However, the user's example only had one problem. Maybe we need to process each proof as a separate problem. Let's see:\n\nFirst problem:\nAssumption: A is a subset of B,\nAssumption: B is a subset of C.\nProblem: Prove that A is a subset of C.\n\nSecond problem:\nAssumption: A is an element of B,\nAssumption: B is an element of C.\nProblem: Prove that A is an element of C.\n\nSo in the formatted output, under \"Assumption\", list each assumption line by line, then the problem. But since there are two separate problems, perhaps present them as two separate entries. However, the user's example didn't do that. The example had one problem with two assumptions and one problem statement. But here, the original question is presenting two different problems. So perhaps each problem should be formatted separately.\n\nBut the user's instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\", implying per problem. But the original question is about two problems. Therefore, perhaps we need to format each problem separately. However, the user hasn't specified. Let me check the example again. The example took the original problem (which was one problem) and formatted it with assumptions and the problem. The original problem here has two distinct problems. So perhaps each should be formatted as separate entries. However, the user hasn't provided an example for multiple problems. But since the user wants the answer in the specified format, and the example only shows one problem, perhaps the assistant should present each problem separately following the same format. But how to combine them?\n\nAlternatively, maybe list both problems under the same \"Problem\" section, but separate them. However, the example's problem was a single problem. The user's original question here is asking about two different proofs. The user may want both to be included in the formatted output.\n\nBut given the example, which handles one problem, perhaps the answer should format each problem separately. So two blocks of ###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###? But the user's instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\", singular. However, the user's input includes two problems. So perhaps the answer should include two separate formatted blocks. Alternatively, combine them into one.\n\nAlternatively, the user may expect both problems to be included in one formatted block. For instance:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a subset of B,\nB is a subset of C,\nA is an element of B,\nB is an element of C.\n\nProblem:\nProve that if A is a subset of B and B is a subset of C, then A is a subset of C. Prove that if A is an element of B and B is an element of C, then A is an element of C.\n\nBut that seems messy. The example had a single problem. So perhaps each problem should be formatted separately. Let me proceed with that.\n\nBut the user's example only formatted one problem, so maybe the user expects each problem to be formatted individually. However, since the original question is about two different problems, perhaps the answer should have two sections. But given the instructions, perhaps the user wants both problems in one formatted block. Let's try that.\n\nWait, looking back at the user's example, the original problem was about proving divisibility by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem included the assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But that seems conflicting because the original problem's divisibility by 91 (which is 7*13) would require n to satisfy certain conditions. Maybe the original example had a typo, but regardless, the user's example shows that the assumptions are the given conditions. In the current problem, for each of the two proofs, the assumptions are the hypotheses of the implication. So for the first proof, the assumptions are A ⊂ B and B ⊂ C, and the problem is to prove A ⊂ C. Similarly, for the second, the assumptions are A ∈ B and B ∈ C, and the problem is to prove A ∈ C.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have two separate entries. However, the user's example only had one problem. Since the user's instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\", perhaps each problem is formatted separately. But the user's original question contains two problems. Therefore, the answer should have two formatted blocks. But since the user hasn't specified how to handle multiple problems, and the example only shows one, maybe the assistant should combine them into one formatted block, listing all assumptions for each problem, and then the problem statements.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is presented as two separate proofs, each with their own assumptions, perhaps the answer should list each as a separate problem.\n\nBut the example's original problem had multiple conditions (n is integer, n divisible by 7) leading to a single problem. So maybe in this case, each implication is a problem, each with its own assumptions. Therefore, two separate formatted blocks. But the user's example only shows one. However, the user's instructions might not have considered multiple problems. Given that, perhaps the answer should include both problems in one formatted block, listing all four assumptions and both problems. But that might not align with the example.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants each implication as a separate problem. So:\n\nFirst formatted block:\nAssumption: A is a subset of B,\nAssumption: B is a subset of C.\nProblem: Prove that A is a subset of C.\n\nSecond formatted block:\nAssumption: A is an element of B,\nAssumption: B is an element of C.\nProblem: Prove that A is an element of C.\n\nBut the user's example only had one block, but the original question here has two. So perhaps the answer should present both blocks. However, the user's instructions didn't specify. To comply with the example's structure, maybe we need to present each problem separately. So the answer will have two formatted blocks. But the user's original input might have intended one. Alternatively, perhaps the user is okay with two.\n\nAlternatively, the original question's title mentions the difference between A ∈ B and A ⊂ B for proofs, so perhaps the problem is about comparing these two statements, hence the two problems are part of one larger problem. But no, the user's question is about two separate proofs.\n\nGiven that, and following the example where each problem is formatted with its own assumptions, the correct approach is to format each problem separately. Therefore, two formatted blocks. However, the user's instructions didn't specify how to handle multiple problems, but given the example, it's safer to follow each problem separately.",
