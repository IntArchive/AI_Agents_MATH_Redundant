    "AcceptedAnswer": "Well, if you really want a proof which uses complex numbers... If $A+B \\not =0, A+C \\not =0$, \n$$(\\frac{A+B}{2}) \\cdot (A-B)=0$$ \n$$(\\frac{A+B}{2}) \\cdot (C-D)=(-\\frac{C+D}{2}) \\cdot (C-D)=0$$\n(Here we are using dot product) Since $A+B \\not =0$, then the vector represented by $(\\frac{A+B}{2})$ is perpendicular to $AB,$ and $CD$, so $AB//CD$. Similarly $AC//BD$, since $A+C \\not =0$. Thus $ABDC$ is a paralellogram, so $A-B=C-D$ (since $A-B \\not =D-C$), giving $A+D=B+C=0$. Thus either $A+B=0, A+C=0,$ or $A+D=0$. By symmetry it suffices to consider when $A+B=0$, then $C+D=0$. $(A-C) \\cdot (B-C)=(A-C) \\cdot (-A-C)=0$ so $AC \\perp BC$. Similarly the other 3 angles are also right angles, so we get a rectangle.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So the problem says that if we have four points A, B, C, D on the unit circle and their sum is zero, then they form a rectangle. We need to prove this using complex numbers. \n\nFirst, let me recall some properties of complex numbers on the unit circle. If a point is on the unit circle, its complex number representation has magnitude 1, so the conjugate of the number is its reciprocal. That is, if A is on the unit circle, then the conjugate of A, denoted as Ā, is equal to 1/A. This might come in handy later.\n\nThe condition given is A + B + C + D = 0. So the sum of these four complex numbers is zero. We need to show that these four points form a rectangle. In the complex plane, a rectangle has opposite sides equal and parallel, and all angles are 90 degrees. Alternatively, the diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other and are equal in length. But how do we translate this into complex numbers?\n\nMaybe I can think about the properties of the complex numbers themselves. Since they are on the unit circle, each of them can be represented as e^(iθ), where θ is the angle they make with the positive real axis. If the points form a rectangle, their angles should be separated by 90 degrees or some symmetry. But how does the sum being zero enforce this?\n\nAnother approach: if the four points form a rectangle, then they must be symmetric in some way. For instance, in a rectangle, the midpoints of the diagonals coincide, which would be the center of the rectangle. Since all points are on the unit circle, the center of the rectangle should be at the origin if the sum is zero. Wait, but the sum being zero would imply that the centroid of the four points is at the origin. Hmm, but how does that lead to the rectangle?\n\nAlternatively, if we consider vectors from the origin to each point, the sum being zero means that the vectors balance each other out. For four vectors to sum to zero, they might form a closed quadrilateral. But not all quadrilaterals are rectangles. So there must be something special about the rectangle that makes this sum zero.\n\nPerhaps we can consider the properties of a rectangle in terms of complex numbers. In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and adjacent sides are perpendicular. If we can show that the differences between consecutive points satisfy these properties, that might work.\n\nLet me denote the points as A, B, C, D in order. Then the sides are B - A, C - B, D - C, and A - D. For a rectangle, we need B - A = D - C and C - B = A - D (opposite sides equal), and also that (B - A) is perpendicular to (C - B), which in complex numbers can be represented as multiplying by i (rotation by 90 degrees). But this might get complicated with the given condition A + B + C + D = 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the fact that in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other. The diagonals would be C - A and D - B. For a rectangle, these diagonals should be equal in length and their midpoints should coincide. Since the sum A + B + C + D = 0, the midpoint of the diagonals would be (A + C)/2 and (B + D)/2. Given that A + C = - (B + D), so (A + C)/2 = - (B + D)/2, meaning the midpoints are negatives of each other. But unless they are both zero, which would mean A + C = B + D = 0. Wait, but if A + B + C + D = 0, then if A + C = - (B + D), but unless they are individually zero, which would require A + C = 0 and B + D = 0. But this would imply that A and C are diametrically opposite, as are B and D. If that's the case, then the points form a rectangle. Because if A and C are endpoints of a diameter, and B and D are endpoints of another diameter, then the four points would form a rectangle. But is that necessarily the case?\n\nWait, if A + C = 0 and B + D = 0, then yes, each pair is diametrically opposite. Then the four points would form a rectangle because the diameters are perpendicular? Not necessarily. If the two diameters are perpendicular, then yes, it's a rectangle. But if the two diameters are not perpendicular, then it would be a parallelogram but not a rectangle. So maybe there's an additional condition that the diameters are perpendicular?\n\nBut in the problem, we only have that A + B + C + D = 0. If A + C = - (B + D), but unless A + C and B + D are both zero, they might not be. So perhaps under the condition A + B + C + D = 0, the only way this holds is if A + C = 0 and B + D = 0, which would force the diameters to be there. But why would that be the case?\n\nWait, suppose A + B + C + D = 0, but A + C = S and B + D = -S. Unless S is zero, we can't say that A + C = 0. So maybe this is not necessarily true. Therefore, perhaps another approach is needed.\n\nLet me consider specific examples. Suppose the four points form a rectangle. Then, they are symmetric. Let's take a simple case where the rectangle is centered at the origin. For example, take A = 1, B = i, C = -1, D = -i. Then A + B + C + D = 1 + i -1 -i = 0. So this satisfies the condition. Another example: take A = e^{iθ}, B = e^{i(θ + π/2)}, C = e^{i(θ + π)}, D = e^{i(θ + 3π/2)}. Then the sum is e^{iθ} + e^{i(θ + π/2)} + e^{i(θ + π)} + e^{i(θ + 3π/2)} = e^{iθ}(1 + i -1 -i) = 0. So this works. So in these cases, the sum is zero. \n\nBut the problem is the converse: if four points on the unit circle sum to zero, then they form a rectangle. So I need to prove that if A + B + C + D = 0, then they must be at angles differing by π/2 radians, forming a rectangle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use properties of complex numbers and their conjugates. Since each point is on the unit circle, we know that the conjugate of A is 1/A, similarly for B, C, D.\n\nGiven that A + B + C + D = 0, taking the conjugate of both sides gives (1/A) + (1/B) + (1/C) + (1/D) = 0. Maybe this can be used somehow.\n\nMultiplying both sides by ABCD (the product of all four), we get BCD + ACD + ABD + ABC = 0. Hmm, not sure if that helps directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that in a rectangle, the product of two adjacent vertices is equal to another? For example, if A, B, C, D form a rectangle, then multiplying A by i (rotation by 90 degrees) would give B, but this depends on the orientation.\n\nWait, if the points form a rectangle, then moving from one vertex to the next involves a rotation by 90 degrees. So perhaps B = A * i^k for some k? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the sum is zero, maybe we can square both sides or consider some symmetric expressions.\n\nLet me compute |A + B + C + D|^2 = 0, since the sum is zero. Expanding this, we get |A|^2 + |B|^2 + |C|^2 + |D|^2 + 2 Re(AĀ + AB + AC + AD + BĀ + BB + BC + BD + CĀ + CB + CC + CD + DĀ + DB + DC + DD) = 0. Wait, but this seems messy. Wait, no, actually |A + B + C + D|^2 is (A + B + C + D)(Ā + B̄ + C̄ + D̄). Since each |A|=|B|=|C|=|D|=1, this would expand to 4 + 2 Re(AB̄ + AC̄ + AD̄ + BC̄ + BD̄ + CD̄) = 0. So 4 + 2 Re(...) = 0, so Re(...) = -2. But I'm not sure how this helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that if four points sum to zero, then they can be considered as the fourth roots of some equation. But not necessarily.\n\nWait, another idea: if four points on the unit circle satisfy A + B + C + D = 0, then perhaps they are the fourth roots of a real number. For example, if they are equally spaced, they would be the fourth roots of unity, but rotated by some angle. But the sum of the fourth roots of unity is zero, which would correspond to a square (a type of rectangle). But the problem states they form a rectangle, not necessarily a square. So maybe the points are vertices of a rectangle, which could be a square or a non-square rectangle. However, on the unit circle, a non-square rectangle would have vertices not equally spaced. \n\nWait, but can a non-square rectangle be inscribed in the unit circle? For a rectangle to be inscribed in a circle, it must be a cyclic quadrilateral, and all rectangles are cyclic since their opposite angles sum to 180 degrees. But the circle is the circumcircle. However, in a unit circle, a rectangle would have its diagonals as diameters. Therefore, the diagonals must be of length 2 (since the diameter of the unit circle is 2). So in a rectangle inscribed in the unit circle, the diagonals are diameters. Therefore, the diagonals must be equal to 2, which is the diameter. Therefore, in such a rectangle, the diagonals are diameters, so the endpoints of the diagonals are diametrically opposite. Therefore, if A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, then C = -A, and similarly B and D are endpoints of another diagonal, so D = -B. Then the four points would be A, B, -A, -B. Then the sum A + B - A - B = 0, which satisfies the condition. But in this case, the four points form a rectangle if and only if the two diameters (A to -A and B to -B) are perpendicular. Because if the diameters are perpendicular, then the four points form a rectangle (specifically, a square if the diameters are also of equal length, but on the unit circle, all diameters are length 2, so it would be a square). Wait, but if the diameters are not perpendicular, then the figure is a rectangle only if the diameters are perpendicular. Wait, no. If you have two diameters (lines through the center), and the four endpoints form a quadrilateral. If the diameters are perpendicular, then the quadrilateral is a rectangle (a square if the diameters are equal in length, but on the unit circle, diameters are all length 2, so it's a square). But if the diameters are not perpendicular, then the quadrilateral is a kite, not a rectangle. Wait, no, if you have two diameters (regardless of the angle between them), the four points would form a rectangle only if the diameters are perpendicular. Because in that case, all angles between adjacent points would be 90 degrees. Otherwise, if the diameters are at an angle θ, then the figure would be a rectangle only if θ is 90 degrees. Otherwise, it's another shape. Wait, actually, no. If you take two diameters (any two diameters), the four points will always form a rectangle? Let me visualize. Suppose I have two diameters at an angle θ. Then connecting the endpoints would form a kite? Or a rectangle? Wait, if you connect the points in order, say A, B, -A, -B, then connecting A to B to -A to -B would create a quadrilateral. If the diameters are perpendicular, it's a square. If not, then it's a rectangle? Wait, no. For example, take A at angle 0, B at angle θ, -A at angle π, -B at angle θ + π. Connecting A(1,0), B(cosθ, sinθ), -A(-1,0), -B(-cosθ, -sinθ). The sides would be from A to B: vector (cosθ -1, sinθ), then from B to -A: vector (-1 - cosθ, -sinθ), then from -A to -B: vector (-cosθ +1, -sinθ), then from -B to A: vector (1 + cosθ, sinθ). For this to be a rectangle, all angles must be 90 degrees. Let's check the dot product between consecutive sides. The first side (B - A) is (cosθ -1, sinθ). The second side (-A - B) is (-1 - cosθ, -sinθ). The dot product between these two vectors is (cosθ -1)(-1 - cosθ) + (sinθ)(-sinθ). Let's compute:\n\nFirst term: (cosθ -1)(-1 - cosθ) = (-cosθ - cos²θ +1 + cosθ) = -cos²θ +1\n\nSecond term: (sinθ)(-sinθ) = -sin²θ\n\nTotal: -cos²θ +1 - sin²θ = -(cos²θ + sin²θ) +1 = -1 +1 = 0\n\nSo the dot product is zero, meaning the first two sides are perpendicular. Similarly, the other angles can be checked. Wait, so even if the two diameters are not perpendicular, the quadrilateral formed by A, B, -A, -B is a rectangle? Wait, but if the diameters are not perpendicular, then adjacent sides are not of equal length. Wait, let's compute the lengths.\n\nLength of A to B: sqrt( (cosθ -1)^2 + (sinθ)^2 ) = sqrt( cos²θ - 2cosθ +1 + sin²θ ) = sqrt(2 - 2cosθ )\n\nLength of B to -A: sqrt( (-1 - cosθ)^2 + (-sinθ)^2 ) = sqrt(1 + 2cosθ + cos²θ + sin²θ ) = sqrt(2 + 2cosθ )\n\nSo unless cosθ = 0 (i.e., θ = 90 degrees), these lengths are different. Therefore, the quadrilateral would have adjacent sides of different lengths, but still perpendicular. So that would make it a rectangle only if all angles are 90 degrees and opposite sides are equal. But in this case, opposite sides are equal. Let's check:\n\nOpposite sides: A to B and -A to -B. The vectors are (cosθ -1, sinθ) and (-cosθ - (-1), -sinθ - (-sinθ))? Wait, no. Wait, the side from -A to -B is (-B - (-A)) = (-B + A) = (A - B). Similarly, the side from A to B is (B - A). So the opposite sides are B - A and A - B, which are negatives of each other, so same length. Similarly, the other pair of opposite sides: B to -A is (-A - B) and -B to A is (A - (-B)) = (A + B). Wait, no. Wait, the sides are:\n\nFirst pair: A to B (B - A) and -A to -B (-B - (-A)) = -B + A = A - B. So these are negatives of each other, hence equal in length.\n\nSecond pair: B to -A (-A - B) and -B to A (A - (-B)) = A + B. These are also negatives of each other: (-A - B) = - (A + B). Hence, same length. \n\nTherefore, opposite sides are equal in length. And we already saw that consecutive sides are perpendicular. Therefore, even if the diameters are not perpendicular, the quadrilateral is a rectangle. Wait, but in that case, if the diameters are not perpendicular, how can the quadrilateral be a rectangle? Because in a rectangle, all angles are 90 degrees, which they are here, and opposite sides are equal, which they are. But in the example I took earlier, where the diameters are not perpendicular, say θ = 60 degrees, then the sides would have lengths sqrt(2 - 2cos60) = sqrt(2 -1) = 1, and sqrt(2 + 2cos60) = sqrt(2 +1) ≈ 1.732. So opposite sides are equal, and adjacent sides are perpendicular but of different lengths. That is a rectangle. So actually, any two diameters (regardless of the angle between them) will form a rectangle when connected in order. Wait, but in that case, the original problem statement is incorrect because it claims that if four points on the unit circle sum to zero, then they form a rectangle, but according to this, any two diameters will form a rectangle, which is true, but a rectangle is not necessarily a square. Wait, but in the unit circle, if you take two diameters at any angle, you get a rectangle. But in the problem, the conclusion is that they form a rectangle, which is true. So the problem is correct.\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"then they form a rectangle\". So according to this, the four points must form a rectangle if their sum is zero, and they are on the unit circle. So our task is to prove that.\n\nBut in my earlier analysis, if four points on the unit circle sum to zero, then they must be two pairs of diametrically opposite points, i.e., A + C = 0 and B + D = 0. Because if A + B + C + D = 0, then we can write (A + C) + (B + D) = 0. If we can show that A + C = 0 and B + D = 0, then each pair is diametrically opposite, and hence forming a rectangle. However, the previous example showed that even if A + C = - (B + D), it's possible that A + C ≠ 0, unless they are both zero. So how can we ensure that A + C = 0 and B + D = 0?\n\nWait, suppose that A + B + C + D = 0. Let me denote S = A + C and T = B + D, so S + T = 0. Therefore, T = -S. But since all points are on the unit circle, |A| = |B| = |C| = |D| = 1.\n\nWe need to show that S = 0 and T = 0. If we can show that S = 0, then T = 0 as well. So how?\n\nConsider |S|^2 = |A + C|^2 = |A|^2 + |C|^2 + 2 Re(AĈ) = 1 + 1 + 2 Re(AĈ) = 2 + 2 Re(AĈ).\n\nSimilarly, |T|^2 = |B + D|^2 = 2 + 2 Re(BḎ).\n\nBut since S + T = 0, we have |S| = |T|. Therefore, |S|^2 = |T|^2, so 2 + 2 Re(AĈ) = 2 + 2 Re(BḎ), which implies Re(AĈ) = Re(BḎ).\n\nBut we also know that T = -S, so B + D = - (A + C). Therefore, substituting this into the equation, perhaps we can find some relations.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the product of S and T. Since S + T = 0, then T = -S. Therefore, the product S * T = - |S|^2. But S * T = (A + C)(B + D) = AB + AD + CB + CD.\n\nBut since all points are on the unit circle, Ā = 1/A, etc. So perhaps we can relate this product to conjugates.\n\nAlternatively, consider the conjugate of S = A + C. Since Ā = 1/A and Ĉ = 1/C, then Ŝ = Ā + Ĉ = 1/A + 1/C = (C + A)/(AC). But S = A + C, so Ŝ = S/(AC). Therefore, |S|^2 = S Ŝ = S * (S/(AC)) = |S|^2 / (AC). Therefore, unless |S|^2 = 0, this would imply that 1/(AC) = 1, so AC = 1. Wait, this seems confusing. Let me compute |S|^2 again.\n\nWait, |S|^2 = (A + C)(Ā + Ĉ) = |A|^2 + AĈ + ĀC + |C|^2 = 1 + AĈ + ĀC + 1 = 2 + 2 Re(AĈ).\n\nSimilarly, as before.\n\nBut I don't see an immediate way to proceed. Let me think differently.\n\nSuppose we assume that A + B + C + D = 0 and all points are on the unit circle. We want to show that the four points form a rectangle. As previously, if they form a rectangle, then they are two pairs of diametrically opposite points with the diameters perpendicular. So to prove that, we need to show that A + C = 0 and B + D = 0, and that the diameters A-C and B-D are perpendicular.\n\nBut how do we show that A + C = 0 and B + D = 0 from A + B + C + D = 0?\n\nWait, consider multiplying both sides by Ā. Since A is on the unit circle, Ā = 1/A. So multiplying A + B + C + D = 0 by Ā gives 1 + ĀB + ĀC + ĀD = 0. Similarly, multiplying by other conjugates might give equations.\n\nAlternatively, consider the sum S = A + B + C + D = 0. Then, the conjugate sum Ŝ = Ā + Ḃ + Ĉ + Ḋ = 0 as well. But since each Ḃ = 1/B, etc.\n\nSo we have:\n\nA + B + C + D = 0\n\n1/A + 1/B + 1/C + 1/D = 0\n\nMultiplying the second equation by ABCD gives:\n\nBCD + ACD + ABD + ABC = 0\n\nBut since A + B + C + D = 0, maybe we can relate these expressions.\n\nAlternatively, note that BCD + ACD + ABD + ABC = CD(B + A) + AB(D + C). Since A + B + C + D = 0, we have A + B = - (C + D). Similarly, C + D = - (A + B). Substitute this into the equation:\n\nCD(- (C + D)) + AB(- (A + B)) = - CD(C + D) - AB(A + B) = 0\n\nBut I'm not sure how this helps.\n\nLet me think geometrically. If four points on the unit circle sum to zero, they must be arranged symmetrically. The most symmetric configuration is that of a rectangle (including a square). But how to formalize this?\n\nAnother approach: For four complex numbers on the unit circle, A, B, C, D, the condition A + B + C + D = 0 implies that the centroid is at the origin. For a quadrilateral inscribed in a circle (a cyclic quadrilateral), the centroid being at the origin might impose specific symmetry.\n\nBut perhaps we can use the concept of the inner product. The sum A + B + C + D = 0 implies that the vector sum is zero. For four vectors of equal length (since they're on the unit circle) summing to zero, they must form a closed quadrilateral. The only closed quadrilateral with all sides equal in magnitude (but not necessarily direction) is a square, but that's not necessarily the case here. Wait, but in our case, the vectors are not the sides of the quadrilateral but the position vectors from the origin to the vertices. So the sum being zero means the centroid is at the origin.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the four points form a parallelogram if and only if the midpoints of the diagonals coincide. But for a parallelogram, the midpoint of A + C and B + D must be the same. In our case, since A + B + C + D = 0, we have A + C = - (B + D), so the midpoints are (A + C)/2 and (B + D)/2 = - (A + C)/2. So the midpoints are negatives of each other, meaning they are symmetric with respect to the origin. This implies that the diagonals bisect each other at the origin, but they are not necessarily equal in length unless A + C = 0 and B + D = 0. If the diagonals bisect each other and are equal in length, then the quadrilateral is a rectangle. Wait, for a quadrilateral, if the diagonals bisect each other, it's a parallelogram. If the diagonals are also equal in length, then it's a rectangle. So in our case, since the midpoints are negatives, the diagonals bisect each other at the origin, but are they equal in length?\n\nThe length of diagonal AC is |A - C|, and the length of diagonal BD is |B - D|. But since A + C = - (B + D), let's compute |A + C| = |B + D|. But |A + C| is not necessarily equal to |A - C|. Wait, |A - C| is the distance between A and C, while |A + C| is the magnitude of the sum.\n\nSo perhaps this approach isn't directly helpful.\n\nLet me try to use complex numbers to express the rectangle condition. If four points A, B, C, D form a rectangle, then the vectors B - A, C - B, D - C, and A - D should satisfy certain conditions. For a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular, so (B - A) is perpendicular to (C - B), etc. In complex numbers, perpendicularity can be checked by multiplying one vector by i (which rotates it by 90 degrees). So if (B - A) multiplied by i equals (C - B), then they are perpendicular and the next side is the rotation of the previous. However, this would imply the rectangle is a square, which is a specific case.\n\nAlternatively, for a general rectangle, adjacent sides need to be perpendicular, but not necessarily related by multiplication by i. However, expressing this in complex numbers might require that the quotient of consecutive sides is purely imaginary. For example, (C - B)/(B - A) should be purely imaginary. Similarly for the other sides.\n\nBut how to relate this to the given condition A + B + C + D = 0?\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe another approach: consider that in a rectangle, the product of two adjacent vertices is related to the others. For example, if the rectangle is centered at the origin, then each vertex is the negative of the opposite vertex. But in our problem, the sum is zero, which might suggest that the centroid is at the origin, but not necessarily that the vertices are paired as negatives.\n\nWait, if we assume that the four points form a rectangle, then they satisfy A + C = B + D = 0 (if the rectangle is centered at the origin). But the problem states that A + B + C + D = 0, which would automatically hold if A + C = 0 and B + D = 0. Therefore, the converse would require that if A + B + C + D = 0, then A + C = 0 and B + D = 0. So how to show that?\n\nSuppose that A + B + C + D = 0. Let’s consider the magnitude squared of A + C and B + D. Since A + C = - (B + D), then |A + C| = |B + D|. Let’s compute |A + C|^2:\n\n|A + C|^2 = |A|^2 + |C|^2 + 2 Re(AĈ) = 1 + 1 + 2 Re(AĈ) = 2 + 2 Re(AĈ)\n\nSimilarly, |B + D|^2 = 2 + 2 Re(BḎ)\n\nBut since A + C = - (B + D), their magnitudes are equal: |A + C| = |B + D|, so 2 + 2 Re(AĈ) = 2 + 2 Re(BḎ), implying Re(AĈ) = Re(BḎ)\n\nBut we need more information to proceed. Let's consider the product (A + C)(B + D) = (A + C)(- (A + C)) = - |A + C|^2\n\nOn the other hand, expanding (A + C)(B + D) = AB + AD + CB + CD\n\nTherefore:\n\nAB + AD + CB + CD = - |A + C|^2\n\nBut since all points are on the unit circle, we can express AD = A/D (since D is on the unit circle, Ḏ = 1/D, so D = 1/Ḏ, etc.)\n\nWait, this might not help directly. Let me think of another property.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the sum A + B + C + D = 0. Then, multiplying both sides by ĀB̄C̄D̄ (the product of the conjugates), which is 1/(ABCD) since each conjugate is 1/ the respective complex number. This gives:\n\n(ĀB̄C̄D̄)(A + B + C + D) = 0 ⇒ (B̄C̄D̄ + ĀC̄D̄ + ĀB̄D̄ + ĀB̄C̄) = 0\n\nBut I'm not sure if this leads anywhere.\n\nWait, another idea: if we consider the complex numbers A, B, C, D as roots of a polynomial. Since they are on the unit circle, the polynomial is reciprocal if roots come in reciprocal pairs, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since there are four points, we can consider the polynomial (z - A)(z - B)(z - C)(z - D) = z^4 + pz^3 + qz^2 + rz + s. The sum of the roots is -p, which in our case is A + B + C + D = 0, so p = 0. Therefore, the polynomial is z^4 + qz^2 + rz + s. But not sure if this helps.\n\nAnother approach: consider using the symmetry of the problem. If we can show that the configuration is symmetric under 180-degree rotation, then it would imply that the points form a rectangle. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think about rotating the entire configuration by 90 degrees. If after rotation, the configuration remains the same, then it's a square. But this might not apply here.\n\nWait, let's get back to the initial example where A, B, C, D are two pairs of diametrically opposite points. Suppose A + C = 0 and B + D = 0, then the four points sum to zero. Conversely, if four points sum to zero, must they be two such pairs?\n\nAssume A + B + C + D = 0. Let's pair A and C, B and D. Suppose that A + C = S and B + D = -S. If we can show that S = 0, then done. But how?\n\nConsider |S|^2 = |A + C|^2 = 2 + 2 Re(AĈ)\n\nAlso, since B + D = -S, then |B + D|^2 = |S|^2 = 2 + 2 Re(BḎ)\n\nTherefore, Re(AĈ) = Re(BḎ)\n\nAlso, from earlier, we have AB + AD + CB + CD = -|S|^2\n\nBut I still don't see the connection. Let's try squaring both sides of A + B + C + D = 0:\n\n(A + B + C + D)^2 = 0 ⇒ A^2 + B^2 + C^2 + D^2 + 2(AB + AC + AD + BC + BD + CD) = 0\n\nBut A, B, C, D are on the unit circle, so A^2 + B^2 + C^2 + D^2 is just the sum of their squares. But since |A|=1, A^2 is just another complex number on the unit circle. Not sure if helpful.\n\nAlternatively, consider that for any complex number z on the unit circle, z^2 = Ā^2, since z̄ = 1/z.\n\nWait, z^2 = (1/Ā)^2 = 1/Ā^2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, take the conjugate of the equation A + B + C + D = 0, which gives Ā + Ḃ + Ĉ + Ḋ = 0. But since each Ḃ = 1/B, etc., we have:\n\n1/A + 1/B + 1/C + 1/D = 0\n\nMultiplying both sides by ABCD:\n\nBCD + ACD + ABD + ABC = 0\n\nWhich we had earlier.\n\nLet me denote this as BCD + ACD + ABD + ABC = 0\n\nFactor out CD from the first two terms: CD(B + A) + AB(D + C) = 0\n\nBut since A + B = - (C + D), substitute:\n\nCD(- (C + D)) + AB(- (A + B)) = - CD(C + D) - AB(A + B) = 0\n\nBut this gives - CD(C + D) - AB(A + B) = 0 ⇒ CD(C + D) + AB(A + B) = 0\n\nLet me denote X = C + D and Y = A + B. Then X = -Y. Substitute X = -Y into the equation:\n\nCD(-Y) + AB(Y) = 0 ⇒ -CD Y + AB Y = Y(AB - CD) = 0\n\nTherefore, either Y = 0 or AB = CD.\n\nIf Y = 0, then A + B = 0 ⇒ B = -A. Similarly, X = -Y = 0 ⇒ C + D = 0 ⇒ D = -C. Therefore, the four points are A, -A, C, -C. These form a rectangle if the diameters A to -A and C to -C are perpendicular. But in this case, the problem doesn't specify that the rectangle is a square, but any two diameters form a rectangle. However, if AB = CD and Y ≠ 0, then AB = CD.\n\nBut Y = A + B, and X = C + D = -Y. So if Y ≠ 0, then AB = CD.\n\nLet me consider both cases:\n\nCase 1: Y = 0. Then A + B = 0 and C + D = 0. Therefore, the four points are A, -A, C, -C. These form a rectangle if and only if A and C are perpendicular, i.e., the angle between A and C is 90 degrees. But how does this follow from the given conditions? It doesn't necessarily, unless we can prove it from AB = CD.\n\nWait, but in this case, if Y = 0, then AB = CD must hold as well? Because in the equation Y(AB - CD) = 0, if Y = 0, then AB - CD can be anything. So if Y = 0, then AB = CD is not necessarily required. Therefore, in this case, we have A + B = 0 and C + D = 0, but no condition on AB and CD. So we have to consider this case separately.\n\nCase 2: Y ≠ 0. Then AB = CD. And since Y = A + B = -X = - (C + D). So in this case, AB = CD and A + B = - (C + D). How can we use this?\n\nLet me try to express C and D in terms of A and B. From C + D = -Y = - (A + B). Let me let S = A + B, so C + D = -S. Also, AB = CD.\n\nSo we have two equations:\n\nC + D = -S\n\nCD = AB\n\nTherefore, C and D are the roots of the quadratic equation z^2 + S z + AB = 0. Solving this:\n\nz = [-S ± sqrt(S^2 - 4AB)] / 2\n\nBut since C and D are on the unit circle, their magnitudes are 1. So |C| = |D| = 1. Therefore, the roots of the quadratic must lie on the unit circle. This imposes certain conditions on S and AB.\n\nThe quadratic equation z^2 + S z + AB = 0. For the roots to be on the unit circle, if z is a root, then 1/z̄ is also a root. But since the product of the roots is AB, so C * D = AB. Therefore, if C is a root, then D = AB / C. But D must also be on the unit circle, so |D| = |AB| / |C| = |A||B| / |C| = 1 * 1 / 1 = 1, so this holds.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe consider specific examples.\n\nSuppose A and B are arbitrary points on the unit circle, and C and D are roots of z^2 + Sz + AB = 0 where S = A + B. For these roots to be on the unit circle, we need to have |C| = |D| = 1. Let's compute |C|^2 = C * Ĉ = 1. Similarly for D.\n\nBut if C is a root, then C^2 + S C + AB = 0 ⇒ C^2 = -S C - AB\n\nTaking magnitudes: |C^2| = | -S C - AB | ⇒ 1 = |S C + AB|\n\nSimilarly, for D: |D| = 1 ⇒ |S D + AB| = 1\n\nThis might help in finding conditions on S and AB.\n\nBut I think this approach is leading me away from the solution. Let me try to think of a different method.\n\nConsider that in a rectangle, the pairwise sums of the vertices are equal to the diagonals. If the rectangle is centered at the origin, then the diagonals are negatives of each other. But in our problem, the sum of all four points is zero, which is similar to the rectangle being centered at the origin.\n\nWait, if the four points form a rectangle centered at the origin, then for each vertex, its opposite vertex is the negative. So A and C are opposites, B and D are opposites. Therefore, A + C = 0 and B + D = 0, leading to A + B + C + D = 0. So this direction is clear. The converse is what we need to prove: if A + B + C + D = 0 and they are on the unit circle, then they must form such a rectangle.\n\nTo prove the converse, assume A + B + C + D = 0. We need to show that this implies that the points form two pairs of diametrically opposite points with the pairs being perpendicular.\n\nEarlier, we considered the case where A + B = 0 and C + D = 0. In that case, the points form a rectangle if the diameters A and B are perpendicular. But how do we enforce that from the given condition?\n\nAlternatively, if we can show that A + B = 0 and C + D = 0, then we are done. So perhaps we need to prove that under the condition A + B + C + D = 0, the only solution is that the points come in diametrically opposite pairs.\n\nBut how?\n\nSuppose A + B + C + D = 0. Consider taking the inner product of both sides with their conjugates. For example, compute |A + B + C + D|^2 = 0, which gives:\n\n|A|^2 + |B|^2 + |C|^2 + |D|^2 + 2 Re(AĀ + AB̄ + AC̄ + AD̄ + BĀ + BB̄ + BC̄ + BD̄ + CĀ + CB̄ + CC̄ + CD̄ + DĀ + DB̄ + DC̄ + DD̄) = 0\n\nWait, no. The expansion of |A + B + C + D|^2 is (A + B + C + D)(Ā + B̄ + Ĉ + D̄) = |A|^2 + |B|^2 + |C|^2 + |D|^2 + 2 Re(AB̄ + AC̄ + AD̄ + BC̄ + BD̄ + CD̄) = 0\n\nSince each |A| = |B| = |C| = |D| = 1, this simplifies to 4 + 2 Re(AB̄ + AC̄ + AD̄ + BC̄ + BD̄ + CD̄) = 0 ⇒ Re(AB̄ + AC̄ + AD̄ + BC̄ + BD̄ + CD̄) = -2\n\nThis gives us a condition on the real part of the sum of these pairwise products. But how to use this?\n\nAlternatively, consider individual terms. Let's denote AB̄ = z, then Re(z) is the real part of z. So we need the sum of the real parts of AB̄, AC̄, AD̄, BC̄, BD̄, CD̄ to be -2.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Let me think of another way.\n\nSuppose we assume that A + B + C + D = 0 and all points are on the unit circle. Then, consider rotating the complex plane by 90 degrees, i.e., multiplying each complex number by i. The new points would be iA, iB, iC, iD. The sum would be i(A + B + C + D) = 0. So the rotated points also satisfy the same condition. If the original points formed a rectangle, the rotated points would also form a rectangle. But I don't know if this helps.\n\nAlternatively, consider that in a rectangle, the product of adjacent vertices is a pure imaginary number. For example, if A, B, C, D are vertices of a rectangle, then (B - A) * i = C - B, implying rotation by 90 degrees. But this might be specific to squares.\n\nAlternatively, for a general rectangle, the sides must be perpendicular. In complex numbers, this means that the ratio of consecutive sides is purely imaginary. For example, (B - A)/(C - B) is purely imaginary. But how to relate this to the sum being zero?\n\nThis seems too vague. Let me return to the earlier approach where we considered two cases: Y = 0 and Y ≠ 0.\n\nCase 1: Y = 0. Then A + B = 0 and C + D = 0. This implies B = -A and D = -C. Therefore, the four points are A, -A, C, -C. These form a rectangle if and only if the diameters A to -A and C to -C are perpendicular. But how do we know they are perpendicular?\n\nFrom the condition A + B + C + D = 0, which is already satisfied regardless of the angle between A and C. Therefore, in this case, the four points form a rectangle only if the diameters are perpendicular. But the problem states that if the sum is zero, then they form a rectangle. Therefore, we must have that the diameters are necessarily perpendicular.\n\nBut how to show that? If A + B + C + D = 0 and A + B = 0, C + D = 0, then we need to show that A and C are perpendicular.\n\nGiven that A + B = 0 ⇒ B = -A, and C + D = 0 ⇒ D = -C. The four points are A, -A, C, -C. These form a rectangle if and only if A and C are perpendicular, i.e., A * Ĉ + Ā * C = 0 (since the dot product in complex numbers is Re(AĈ)).\n\nBut since A and C are on ",
