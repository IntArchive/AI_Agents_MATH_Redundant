    "Content": "The problem is this: if $1\\le p<q<\\infty$ then $\\ell^p$ and $\\ell^q$ are not isometric (as Banach spaces). This is an exercise but I'd like to see an elegant proof.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Remark As is well-known, the Banach spaces $c_0$ and $\\ell^p$ for $1\\leq p<\\infty$ are mutually non-isomorphic, as a consequence of Pitt's theorem. See Corollary 2.1.6 in Albiac-Kalton's book . It seems a bit easier to prove the weaker result saying that the $\\ell^p$ spaces are mutually non-isometric. Note that $\\ell^1$ is not strictly convex, while Clarkson's inequalities show that $\\ell^p$ is strictly convex for every $1<p<\\infty$. So $\\ell^1$ is not isometric to $\\ell^p$ for any $1<p<\\infty$. We could obtain the same conclusion using reflexivity or uniform convexity instead of strict convexity. Now assume there exist $1<p,q<\\infty$ such that $\\ell^p$ and $\\ell^q$ are isometric via some isometry $T$: $\\|Tx\\|_p=\\|x\\|_q$ for every $x\\in \\ell^q$. We need to show that $p=q$. Sketch An elementary manipulation of Clarkson's inequalities ( see here for a short proof by R.P. Boas) yields Claim 1 below. Claims 2,3,4 follow immediately. This allows us to rule out every case but $q=p$ and $q=p'$. So it only remains to check that $\\ell^2$ is the only $\\ell^p$ space which is isometric to its dual (i.e. Claim 5, essentially). We will denote $p'$ the conjugate exponent associated with $p$, i.e. $\\frac{1}{p}+\\frac{1}{p'}=1 \\iff p'=\\frac{p}{p-1}$. Recall that the continuous dual $(\\ell^p)'$ is isometric to $\\ell^{p'}$ for every $1<p<\\infty$. Claim 1 If $p\\geq 2$, then $p'\\leq q\\leq p$. Proof For every $x,y \\in \\ell^q$, we have\n$$\n\\big\\| \\frac{x+y}{2} \\big\\|_q^p+\\big\\| \\frac{x-y}{2} \\big\\|_q^p=\\big\\| \\frac{Tx+Ty}{2} \\big\\|_p^p+\\big\\| \\frac{Tx-Ty}{2} \\big\\|_p^p\n$$\n$$\n\\leq \\frac{\\|Tx\\|_p^p+\\|Ty\\|_p^p}{2}=\\frac{\\|x\\|_q^p+\\|y\\|_q^p}{2}\n$$\nwhere we used Clarkson's inequality for $p\\geq 2$. In particular, for $x=(1,1,0,\\ldots)$ and $y=(1,-1,0,\\ldots)$, this yields \n$$2=1+1\\leq \\frac{2^\\frac{p}{q}+2^\\frac{p}{q}}{2}=2^\\frac{p}{q}\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad q\\leq p$$\nWhile for $x=(2,0,\\ldots)$ and $y=(0,2,0,\\ldots)$, we get\n$$\n2\\cdot 2^\\frac{p}{q}=2^\\frac{p}{q}+2^\\frac{p}{q} \\leq \\frac{2^p+2^p}{2}=2^p \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad p'=\\frac{p}{p-1}\\leq q\n$$\nTherefore we have $p'\\leq q\\leq p$. $\\Box$ Claim 2 If $p\\leq 2$, then $p\\leq q\\leq p'$. Proof Taking the dual,  $\\ell^p\\simeq \\ell^q$ yields an isometric isomorphism $\\ell^{p'}\\simeq \\ell^{q'}$. Since $p'\\geq 2$, Claim 1 applied to $p'$ implies $(p')'\\leq q'\\leq p'\\iff p\\leq q\\leq p'$. $\\Box$ Claim 3 If $p$ and $q$ are both $\\geq 2$ or both $\\leq 2$, then $p=q$. Proof Assume $p,q\\geq 2$. Applying Claim 1 to $p$ yields $q\\leq p$, while applying it to $q$ gives $p\\leq q$. Hence $p=q$. The case $p,q \\leq 2$ follows from Claim 2 in a similar manner. Or you can just take the duals and conclude that $p'=q'$ since they are both $\\geq 2$. $\\Box$ Claim 4 If $p\\geq 2$ and $q\\leq 2$, then $q=p'$. Proof By Claim 1 for $p$, we have $p'\\leq q$. By Claim 2 for $q$, we get $p\\leq q' \\iff q\\leq p'$. Hence $q=p'$. $\\Box$ Claim 5 If $\\ell^p$ is isometric to $\\ell^{p'}$, then $p=p'=2$. Proof Still pondering what the easiest argument could be... [Edit by the OP: see my answer below , which should prove Claim 5 and finish the problem off.]",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question according to the specified format. Let me read the original question again carefully.\n\nThe title is \"ℓ^p is not isometric to ℓ^q\". The problem states that if 1 ≤ p < q < ∞, then ℓ^p and ℓ^q are not isometric as Banach spaces. The user mentions it's an exercise and wants an elegant proof.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem says that p and q are in the range 1 ≤ p < q < ∞. Also, we're dealing with the Banach spaces ℓ^p and ℓ^q. The main condition here is that they are not isometric. \n\nWait, the problem's statement is that they are not isometric, so the assumption would be the conditions on p and q, and that we're considering them as Banach spaces. Let me list the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nAssumptions should be:\n\n- 1 ≤ p < q < ∞\n- ℓ^p is a Banach space\n- ℓ^q is a Banach space\n\nBut wait, the problem states \"if 1 ≤ p < q < ∞ then...\", so the main assumptions are the conditions on p and q. The fact that they are Banach spaces is part of the context, but maybe it's redundant since ℓ^p and ℓ^q are always Banach spaces for 1 ≤ p, q ≤ ∞. So perhaps the key assumptions are the inequalities between p and q.\n\nSo, the assumptions would be:\n\n1 ≤ p < q < ∞\n\nBut the problem is to show they are not isometric. So the problem statement would be: Prove that ℓ^p and ℓ^q are not isometric (as Banach spaces) when 1 ≤ p < q < ∞.\n\nWait, in the example provided, the user had to note that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, the main conditions are p and q's range.\n\nSo, structuring it:\n\nAssumption:\n1 ≤ p < q < ∞,\nℓ^p is a Banach space,\nℓ^q is a Banach space.\n\nBut maybe the mention of Banach spaces is part of the problem statement, not the assumptions. The problem is to show they aren't isometric as Banach spaces. The assumptions are the given conditions leading to that conclusion. The problem statement includes the context that they are Banach spaces. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is presented in the context where both spaces are known to be Banach, so the key assumptions are the p and q conditions. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer, and another that n is divisible by 7. The problem then was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. So the assumptions are the given conditions on the variables.\n\nIn this problem, the given conditions are 1 ≤ p < q < ∞, and that we are considering ℓ^p and ℓ^q as Banach spaces. But maybe the Banach space part is part of the problem's context, not an assumption. Because the problem is about them being isometric as Banach spaces, so perhaps the assumptions are just the inequalities between p and q.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"if 1 ≤ p < q < ∞ then ℓ^p and ℓ^q are not isometric (as Banach spaces)\". So the assumption is the condition on p and q. The fact that they are Banach spaces is inherent in the spaces ℓ^p and ℓ^q when p and q are in [1, ∞), so maybe it's not necessary to list them as assumptions. The key assumption is the range of p and q. Therefore, the assumption would be:\n\n1 ≤ p < q < ∞\n\nAnd the problem is to prove that ℓ^p and ℓ^q are not isometric (as Banach spaces).\n\nSo the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n1 ≤ p < q < ∞\n\nProblem:\nProve that ℓ^p and ℓ^q are not isometric (as Banach spaces).\n\nBut I should check if there are other implicit assumptions. For example, the spaces are over a certain field, probably real or complex numbers. But since the user didn't specify, maybe it's assumed to be real numbers. However, the original problem doesn't mention the field, so maybe it's unnecessary to include unless specified. The example didn't include field assumptions either. So perhaps we can stick to the given explicit conditions.\n\nHence, the final structured problem would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n1 ≤ p < q < ∞\nProblem:\nProve that $\\ell^p$ and $\\ell^q$ are not isometric (as Banach spaces).\n###",
