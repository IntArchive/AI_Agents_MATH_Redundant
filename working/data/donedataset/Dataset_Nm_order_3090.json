    "Content": "Let $(M,d)$ and $(N,d')$ be metric spaces. Prove that the product topology is induced by the metric $d_1((x,y),(x',y')=d(x,x')+d(y,y')$ and $d_2((x,y),(x',y'))=\\operatorname{max}\\{d(x,y),d'(x',y')\\}$. I have to say, that I truly have no idea how to prove that a metric induces a certain topology, my guess here is to just  consider the topology induced by the metric as well as the product topology and show that they are included in each other. I don't have a complete proof, but I wrote  a couple of things following that idea: $(1)$ Let $T$ be the product topology and $T_i$ be the topology induced by the metric $d_i$. A basis for the product topology of $M\\times N$ contains sets of the form $U\\times V$ where $U$ is open in $M$ and $V$ is open in $N$; and a basis for the topology induced by $T_1$ would be the sets of open balls according to the metric $d_1$, this is, the set of all open balls where each ball si given by $$B_{1}((x,y),r) = \\{(x',y')\\in M\\times N:d_1((x,y),(x',y'))<r\\}$$ In terms of the metric $d,d'$ the balls could be expressed as $$B_{1}((x,y),r) = \\{(x',y')\\in M\\times N:d(x,y)+d'(x',y')<r\\}$$ Which means I need to show that for $(x,y)\\in U\\times V$ open in $M\\times N$ there is a ball such that $$(x,y)\\in B_1((x,y),r)\\subset U\\times V$$ Now, what are exactly those open sets $U$ and $V$?. $M$ and $N$ are metric spaces which means that $U$ and $V$ are open balls according to their respective metric, then I could write $$U=B_{U}(x,\\delta)=\\{y\\in M:d(x,y)<\\delta\\}$$ $$V=B_{V}(x',\\epsilon)=\\{y'\\in N:d'(x',y')<\\epsilon\\}$$ I would like to pick $r$ in order that $\\pi_{1}^{-1}(B_1((x,y),r))\\subset U$ and $\\pi_{2}^{-1}(B_1((x',y'),r))\\subset V$. I have thought two different ways of working this part, but I don't know which of them is right $(1a)$ One of the ideas to solve this problem was to set $r<\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{2}\\operatorname{min}\\{\\delta,\\epsilon\\}$. Doing this I believe that from $d(x,y)+d'(x',y')<r$ I can conclude that $d(x,y)<\\delta$ and $d'(x',y')<\\epsilon$, therefore the ball is included in the set. $(2a)$ On second thoughts, maybe $(1a)$ was excessive and considering that the set $U\\times V$ would have a diameter of $\\delta+\\epsilon$ according to the metric $d_1$, maybe it would be enough just to sed $r<\\delta+\\epsilon$ so the open ball would lie inside $U\\times V$? Now I will assume the open ball is given, how can I pic $\\delta$ and $\\epsilon$ to have $U\\times V$ inside the ball?.Taking $\\delta=\\epsilon < \\frac{1}{2}r$ seems to be enough. Does this prove that $T=T_1$? $(2)$ Now the ball $B_2$ would be given by $$B_2((x,y),r)=\\{(x',y'):\\operatorname{max}\\{d(x,x'),d'(y,y')\\}<r\\}$$ Here I don't know how to proceed, my problem with this is that I need to find a relation between $r$ and $\\delta,\\epsilon$ in order to define the inclusions as I did before, but I believe I need to know more about $d(x,x')$ and $d'(y,y')$ if I were to define $r$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "my guess here just consider the topology induced by the metric as well\n  as the product topology and show that they are included in each other. Yes, exactly. As you noted, if $T$ is the product topology then an open set in $T$ is of the form $U \\times V$ where $U$ is open in $(M,d)$ adn $V$ is open in $(N,d')$. To show $T=T_1$ you can show that (i) for $(x,y) \\in U \\times V$ there exists $ \\delta$ such that $B_{d_1}((x,y),\\delta ) \\subseteq U \\times V$ and (ii) If $B_{d_1}((x,y), r)$ is an open ball (in $T_1$) and $(x',y') \\in B_{d_1}((x,y), r)$ then there exists $U \\times V$ in the product topology such that $(x',y') \\in U \\times V \\subseteq  B_{d_1}((x,y), r)$ The same two proofs with $d_1$ replaced by $d_2$ will yield $T = T_2$. Now regarding $T = T_1$: $(1a)$ One of the ideas to solve this problem was to set\n  $r<\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{2}\\operatorname{min}\\{\\delta,\\epsilon\\}$.\n  Doing this I believe that from $d(x,y)+d'(x',y')<r$ I can conclude\n  that $d(x,y)<\\delta$ and $d'(x',y')<\\epsilon$, therefore the ball is\n  included in the set. Yes that's also correct. This appears to be direction (ii) above: \nLet $U \\times V$ be open in $T$ and $(x,y) \\in U \\times V$ and consider $B((x,y),r)$ where $r < {\\min (\\delta , \\varepsilon) \\over 2}$. Then for any $(x',y') \\in  B((x,y),r)$ we have \n$$ d_1 ((x,y), (x',y')) = d(x,x') + d(y,y') < r$$ In particular, $d(x,x') < \\delta$ and $d(y,y') < \\varepsilon$ hence $x' \\in U$ and $y' \\in V$ and hence $(x',y') \\in U \\times V$, showing that $B((x,y),r) \\subseteq U \\times V$ hence $U \\times V$ is open in $T_1$. (2a)... From the above you can see that $r = \\delta + \\varepsilon$ does not work. Now I will assume the open ball is given, how can I pick $\\delta$ and\n  $\\epsilon$ to have $U\\times V$ inside the ball? Taking\n  $\\delta=\\epsilon < \\frac{1}{2}r$ seems to be enough. Does this prove that $T=T_1$? No but almost. Let $B_{d_1}((x,y),r)$ be an open ball in $T_1$ and $(x',y') \\in B((x,y),r)$. You want to find an open set in $T$ that contains $(x',y')$ and is contained in $B((x,y),r)$. Let $R = {\\min (r-d_1((x,y),(x',y'), d_1((x,y),(x',y'))\\over 2}$ and consider the set $B_d(x', R) \\times B_{d'}(y',R)$ (open in $T$). Then $d_1((x,y),(x',y')) = d(x,x') + d(y,y') < \\min( r-d_1((x,y),(x',y'), d_1((x,y),(x',y'))) < r$. (2)... (2) is easier than (1): Note that if $\\max (\\delta, \\varepsilon) < r$ then both $\\delta < r$ and $\\varepsilon < r$. I hope this helps and if not leave me a comment.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to prove that two specific metrics, d₁ and d₂, induce the product topology on the product of two metric spaces M and N. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what it means for a metric to induce a topology. The topology induced by a metric is the collection of all open sets generated by the open balls defined by that metric. The product topology on M×N, on the other hand, has a basis consisting of sets of the form U×V, where U is open in M and V is open in N. \n\nSo the goal here is to show that the topology generated by d₁ (and similarly d₂) is the same as the product topology. To do this, we need to demonstrate that every open set in the product topology is open in the metric topology and vice versa. This typically involves showing that basis elements of each topology can be contained within each other.\n\nStarting with d₁((x,y),(x',y')) = d(x,x') + d'(y,y'). Let's think about the open balls in this metric. An open ball around (x,y) with radius r would consist of all points (x',y') such that d(x,x') + d'(y,y') < r. \n\nNow, in the product topology, a basic open set is U×V where U is an open ball in M and V is an open ball in N. Suppose U = B_d(x, δ) and V = B_{d'}(y, ε). Then U×V would contain all points (x', y') where d(x,x') < δ and d'(y,y') < ε. \n\nTo show that the metric topology induced by d₁ includes the product topology, we need to show that any such U×V is open in the d₁ metric. That means for any point (x,y) in U×V, there exists an r > 0 such that the d₁ ball of radius r around (x,y) is entirely contained within U×V. \n\nIf we take r = min(δ, ε), maybe? Wait, let's think. If we take a point (x,y) in U×V, then U is a ball of radius δ around x in M, and V is a ball of radius ε around y in N. If we take r to be the minimum of δ and ε, then for any (x', y') in the d₁ ball of radius r, we have d(x,x') + d'(y,y') < r. But since r is the minimum of δ and ε, this sum being less than r would imply both d(x,x') < r and d'(y,y') < r, which are each less than δ and ε respectively. So then (x',y') would be in U×V. Wait, but if d(x,x') + d'(y,y') < r, then individually d(x,x') < r and d'(y,y') < r. Because if either term were ≥ r, the sum would be ≥ r. Therefore, choosing r = min(δ, ε) ensures that the d₁ ball of radius r is contained within U×V. \n\nConversely, to show that every d₁ open ball is open in the product topology, take a d₁ ball B₁((x,y), r). We need to express this as a union of basic open sets U×V from the product topology. For any point (x', y') in B₁((x,y), r), we can find δ and ε such that the product of balls B_d(x', δ) × B_{d'}(y', ε) is contained within B₁((x,y), r). But maybe it's easier to cover the d₁ ball with product opens. Alternatively, for each point in the d₁ ball, find a product open set around it contained in the d₁ ball. \n\nAlternatively, since the metric d₁ is a sum metric, the topology it generates is the product topology. But I need to verify this. \n\nNow, moving to d₂((x,y),(x',y')) = max{d(x,x'), d'(y,y')}. Similarly, the open balls here would be all points (x', y') where both d(x,x') < r and d'(y,y') < r. Because the max of the two distances has to be less than r. So the d₂ ball of radius r is actually the product of the d-ball of radius r in M and the d'-ball of radius r in N. Therefore, the basic open sets in d₂ are exactly the products of open balls in M and N with the same radius. \n\nIn the product topology, the basic open sets can have different radii for M and N. So to show equivalence, we need to see that any product of open balls (with possibly different radii) can be covered by d₂ balls and vice versa. For example, if we have U×V where U is a ball of radius δ and V is a ball of radius ε, then take r = min(δ, ε). The d₂ ball of radius r would be contained within U×V. Conversely, a d₂ ball of radius r is just the product of two balls of radius r, so it's already a basic open set in the product topology. \n\nWait, but in the product topology, the basic open sets can have different radii for each factor. So to cover a d₂ ball (which requires both radii to be the same) with product open sets, we might need to take unions of such products. However, since in the product topology, arbitrary unions are allowed, this should work. \n\nBut perhaps the key is that the basis for the product topology can be generated by the max metric, since you can always adjust the radii. For example, if you have a product open set U×V with radii δ and ε, then taking r = min(δ, ε), the max metric ball of radius r would fit inside U×V. Conversely, any max metric ball of radius r is a product of balls of radius r in each space, which is a basic open set in the product topology. Therefore, the topologies are the same. \n\nSo for both metrics d₁ and d₂, we need to show that their induced topologies are the same as the product topology by showing mutual inclusion: every open set in the product topology is open in the metric topology, and vice versa. \n\nThe original question mentions using the approach of showing each topology is included in the other. The user seems to have some steps for d₁ but is confused about how to choose r, δ, ε. For d₂, they are unsure how to relate r with δ and ε. \n\nIn the example provided, the user considered setting r < min{δ, ε}/2 for d₁. But as I thought earlier, if you set r = min(δ, ε), then the sum d + d' < r would imply both d < r and d' < r, which are ≤ δ and ε respectively. Wait, but if r = min(δ, ε), then d < r ≤ δ and d' < r ≤ ε. So that works. But the user considered r < (min{δ, ε})/2. Maybe they were being overly cautious? If you take r = min(δ, ε), then d + d' < r would require both d and d' to be less than r, which is ≤ δ and ε. However, actually, if d + d' < r, then individually d < r and d' < r. Because if d ≥ r, then even if d' is 0, the sum is ≥ r. So indeed, taking r = min(δ, ε) suffices. Therefore, the open ball in d₁ of radius r is contained in U×V. \n\nConversely, to show that a d₁ open ball is open in the product topology, take any point in the d₁ ball and find a product open set around it contained in the ball. For a given (x', y') in B₁((x,y), r), we can find δ and ε such that B_d(x', δ) × B_{d'}(y', ε) is contained in B₁((x,y), r). Let's see. The distance from (x,y) to (x', y') is d(x,x') + d'(y,y') = s < r. We need to choose δ and ε such that for any (x'', y'') in B_d(x', δ) × B_{d'}(y', ε), we have d(x,x'') + d'(y,y'') < r. Using triangle inequality: d(x,x'') ≤ d(x,x') + d(x',x'') < s1 + δ, and similarly d'(y,y'') < s2 + ε, where s1 + s2 = s. Wait, maybe this approach is more complicated. Alternatively, since the metric d₁ is a sum, the open balls in d₁ can be covered by product open sets. But perhaps it's easier to note that both d₁ and d₂ generate the same topology as the product topology because they are both equivalent in terms of convergence, but I need to stick to the basis approach. \n\nFor d₂, the max metric, the open ball is B₂((x,y), r) = {(x',y') | max(d(x,x'), d'(y,y')) < r} = B_d(x, r) × B_{d'}(y, r). So this is exactly a product of open balls in M and N with the same radius. To show this generates the product topology, note that any basic open set U×V in the product topology can be written as a union of such max metric balls. For example, if U is B_d(x, δ) and V is B_{d'}(y, ε), then take r = min(δ, ε), and the max metric ball B₂((x,y), r) is contained in U×V. Conversely, every max metric ball is a product of open balls, hence open in the product topology. \n\nSo summarizing, for both metrics, the key is to show that the basis elements of each topology can contain each other. For d₁, the sum metric, the open balls are \"diamond\" shapes, but in product spaces, these can be fit into product open sets by choosing appropriate radii, and vice versa. \n\nThe user's confusion seems to be about selecting the correct radii and ensuring the inclusions. For d₁, they considered r < min(δ, ε)/2, which might be too restrictive, but actually, r = min(δ, ε) is sufficient. For d₂, since the max metric directly relates to product balls, choosing r = min(δ, ε) also works. \n\nTherefore, the structured problem should list the assumptions about the metric spaces and the metrics d₁ and d₂, then state the problem to prove they induce the product topology.",
