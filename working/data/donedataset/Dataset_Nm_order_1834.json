    "Content": "Question: Suppose $f:(-\\delta,\\delta)\\to (0,\\infty)$ has the property that $$\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\left(f(x)+\\frac{1}{f(x)}\\right)=2.$$ Show that $\\lim_{x\\to 0}f(x)=1$ . My approach: Let $h:(-\\delta,\\delta)\\to(-1,\\infty)$ be such that $h(x)=f(x)-1, \\forall x\\in(-\\delta,\\delta).$ Note that if we can show that $\\lim_{x\\to 0}h(x)=0$ , then we will be done.

    "AcceptedAnswer": "1 st Solution. Although not the most straightforward one, let me present a quick solution: First, we note that $$ \\lim_{x\\to0} \\left| f(x) - \\frac{1}{f(x)} \\right|\n= \\lim_{x\\to0} \\sqrt{\\left(f(x) + \\frac{1}{f(x)} \\right)^2 - 4}\n= 0, $$ Then by using $\\max\\{a,b\\} = \\frac{a+b}{2} + \\frac{|a-b|}{2}$ and $\\min\\{a,b\\} = \\frac{a+b}{2} - \\frac{|a-b|}{2}$ which hold for any $a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}$ , we get $$ \\lim_{x\\to0} \\max\\biggl\\{ f(x), \\frac{1}{f(x)} \\biggr\\} = 1 = \\lim_{x\\to0} \\min\\biggl\\{ f(x), \\frac{1}{f(x)} \\biggr\\}. $$ Now the desired conclusion follows by the squeezing theorem. 2 nd Solution.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. So the question is about showing that if the limit of f(x) plus 1 over f(x) as x approaches 0 is 2, then the limit of f(x) itself must be 1. The user tried to use substitution h(x) = f(x) - 1 and manipulate the equation, but got stuck with the bounds. Let me see.\n\nFirst, the given condition is that f is a function from (-δ, δ) to (0, ∞), so f is positive near 0. The limit of f(x) + 1/f(x) as x approaches 0 is 2. We need to show that the limit of f(x) is 1.\n\nThe user's approach was to set h(x) = f(x) - 1, so f(x) = 1 + h(x). Then substituting into the expression:\n\nf(x) + 1/f(x) = (1 + h(x)) + 1/(1 + h(x)).\n\nThey then manipulated this expression and ended up with [(h(x))^2]/(1 + h(x)) approaching 0 as x approaches 0. So, the limit of [h(x)^2 / (1 + h(x))] is 0.\n\nThe user tried to bound h(x) using the sandwich theorem but had conflicting inequalities depending on whether h(x) is positive or negative. Let's analyze this.\n\nIf h(x) is positive, then h(x) ≥ h(x)^2 / (1 + h(x)), since 1 + h(x) ≥ 1, so denominator is ≥1, hence h(x)^2 / (1 + h(x)) ≤ h(x)^2. Wait, maybe their bound is different. Let me check:\n\nSuppose h(x) ≥ 0. Then h(x) + 1 ≥ 1, so h(x)^2 / (h(x) + 1) ≤ h(x)^2. But if h(x) is small, h(x)^2 is even smaller. However, the limit of h(x)^2 / (h(x) + 1) is 0. But this doesn't directly bound h(x) itself.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they considered that h(x) ≥ h(x)^2 / (h(x) + 1) when h(x) ≥ 0. Let's see:\n\nh(x) - [h(x)^2 / (h(x) + 1)] = [h(x)(h(x) + 1) - h(x)^2] / (h(x) + 1) ) = [h(x)] / (h(x) + 1) ≥ 0 when h(x) ≥ 0. So yes, h(x) ≥ h(x)^2 / (h(x) + 1). Similarly, if h(x) < 0, since h(x) + 1 > 0 (because f(x) = 1 + h(x) > 0, so h(x) > -1), then h(x) is negative. Then h(x) = [h(x)^2 / (h(x) + 1)] * (h(x) + 1)/h(x). Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated.\n\nThe user's bounds are: when h(x) ≥0, h(x) ≥ h(x)^2 / (h(x) +1). When h(x) <0, h(x) < h(x)^2 / (h(x)+1). So in both cases, the expression h(x)^2/(h(x)+1) is between h(x) and something else? Hmm.\n\nBut since the limit of h(x)^2/(h(x)+1) is 0, maybe we can use these inequalities to bound h(x). Let's think about when h(x) is positive. If h(x) ≥0, then h(x)^2/(h(x)+1) ≤ h(x), because h(x)+1 ≥1, so h(x)^2/(h(x)+1) ≤ h(x)^2. Wait, not sure. Wait, for h(x) ≥0, h(x) +1 ≥1, so h(x)^2/(h(x) +1) ≤ h(x)^2. But h(x)^2 is (h(x))^2. But how does that relate to h(x)? If h(x) is small, h(x)^2 is smaller than h(x). So if h(x) is between 0 and 1, h(x)^2 ≤ h(x). So then h(x)^2/(h(x)+1) ≤ h(x)^2 ≤ h(x). Therefore, if h(x) is in [0,1], then h(x)^2/(h(x)+1) ≤ h(x). But since the left side goes to 0, then h(x) must go to 0. Similarly, when h(x) is negative, h(x) < h(x)^2/(h(x)+1). Let's check when h(x) is negative.\n\nSuppose h(x) is in (-1, 0). Let me pick h = -0.5. Then h^2/(h +1) = (0.25)/(0.5) = 0.5. So h(x) = -0.5, h(x)^2/(h(x)+1) = 0.5, which is greater than h(x). So indeed, when h(x) is negative, h(x) < h(x)^2/(h(x)+1). So if h(x) is negative and h(x)^2/(h(x)+1) approaches 0, then since h(x) is less than that expression, which is approaching 0 from above (because denominator is h(x)+1, which is between 0 and 1 when h(x) is in (-1,0)), so h(x) is negative but h(x)^2/(h(x)+1) is positive. So the limit of h(x)^2/(h(x)+1) is 0, so from the right side (positive approaching 0). But h(x) is less than that expression, which is approaching 0, so h(x) is approaching 0 from below.\n\nBut how do we formalize this? For the case when h(x) ≥0, we have 0 ≤ h(x)^2/(h(x)+1) ≤ h(x). Since the middle term approaches 0, by sandwich theorem, h(x) approaches 0.\n\nFor the case when h(x) <0, we have h(x) < h(x)^2/(h(x)+1) <0? Wait, no. Wait, when h(x) is negative, h(x) +1 is positive (since h(x) > -1). So h(x)^2 is positive, so h(x)^2/(h(x)+1) is positive. Therefore, h(x) is negative, but h(x)^2/(h(x)+1) is positive, so h(x) < h(x)^2/(h(x)+1). But since h(x)^2/(h(x)+1) approaches 0, then h(x) is less than something approaching 0 from the positive side. So h(x) is bounded above by something going to 0, but h(x) could be going to 0 from below. However, to apply sandwich theorem, we need a lower bound for h(x) when it's negative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider the absolute value. Let me think. Let’s define |h(x)|. If we can show that |h(x)| ≤ [h(x)^2/(h(x)+1)] when h(x) is positive, and when h(x) is negative, perhaps another bound. Wait, when h(x) is positive, h(x)^2/(h(x)+1) = h(x)^2/(h(x)+1) = h(x) * [h(x)/(h(x)+1)]. Since h(x)/(h(x)+1) <1, so h(x)^2/(h(x)+1) < h(x). So 0 ≤ h(x)^2/(h(x)+1) < h(x). Therefore, if the left side goes to 0, then by sandwich theorem, h(x) approaches 0.\n\nWhen h(x) is negative, h(x) is in (-1,0). Then h(x) +1 is in (0,1). So h(x)^2/(h(x)+1) is positive. Also, since h(x) is negative, h(x) = -k(x) where k(x) is in (0,1). Then h(x)^2 = k(x)^2, and h(x)+1 = 1 - k(x). So h(x)^2/(h(x)+1) = k(x)^2/(1 - k(x)). We need to relate this to |h(x)| = k(x). So k(x)^2/(1 -k(x)) versus k(x). Since 1 -k(x) <1 (because k(x) >0), so k(x)^2/(1 -k(x)) > k(x)^2. But k(x)^2/(1 -k(x)) is greater than k(x)^2, but how does that compare to k(x)? Let's see:\n\nSuppose k(x) is small, approaching 0. Then k(x)^2/(1 -k(x)) ≈ k(x)^2. So if k(x)^2 approaches 0, then k(x) approaches 0. But this is circular.\n\nAlternatively, note that since h(x)^2/(h(x)+1) approaches 0, and h(x)+1 >0, then h(x)^2 must approach 0, hence h(x) approaches 0. Wait, but h(x)^2 approaching 0 implies h(x) approaches 0. Because the square of h(x) going to zero implies h(x) goes to zero. Is that correct?\n\nYes! Because if h(x)^2 approaches 0, then h(x) must approach 0. So even though the original expression is h(x)^2/(h(x)+1), if that approaches 0, and h(x)+1 is approaching 1 (if h(x) approaches 0), then h(x)^2 must approach 0, hence h(x) approaches 0. Wait, but wait: h(x)+1 could approach something else? For example, if h(x) approaches a limit L, then h(x)+1 approaches L+1. But if the limit of h(x)^2/(h(x)+1) is 0, then either h(x)^2 approaches 0 (so h(x) approaches 0), or h(x)+1 approaches infinity. But h(x)+1 can't approach infinity because h(x) is in (-1, ∞), but near x=0, h(x) is near 0 (since the limit of f(x) is supposed to be 1). Wait, but maybe h(x) could go to infinity? No, because f(x) is in (0, ∞), so h(x) = f(x)-1 must be in (-1, ∞). But if h(x) approaches infinity, then f(x) approaches infinity, but then f(x) + 1/f(x) would approach infinity, which contradicts the given limit of 2. So h(x) can't approach infinity. Therefore, the only possibility is that h(x) approaches 0.\n\nWait, this is a different approach. Suppose that lim_{x→0} [h(x)^2/(h(x)+1)] =0. Let’s assume that h(x) does not approach 0. Then there exists some ε>0 and a sequence x_n →0 such that |h(x_n)| ≥ε. Then h(x_n)^2/(h(x_n)+1) ≥ (ε^2)/(|h(x_n)| +1). If h(x_n) is bounded away from 0, but |h(x_n)| +1 is bounded by, say, some M. Then h(x_n)^2/(h(x_n)+1) ≥ ε^2 / M >0, contradicting the limit. Therefore, h(x) must approach 0.\n\nBut this might be more advanced than needed. Maybe the user's original approach with sandwich theorem can work. Let's see.\n\nWhen h(x) ≥0: 0 ≤ h(x)^2/(h(x)+1) ≤ h(x). Because h(x)+1 ≥1, so denominator is at least 1, so h(x)^2/(h(x)+1) ≤ h(x)^2 ≤ h(x) if h(x) ≤1. But near x=0, as x approaches 0, h(x) is approaching 0 (we need to show), so eventually h(x) will be less than 1. Therefore, for x near 0, h(x) is in [0,1), and thus h(x)^2/(h(x)+1) ≤ h(x). Therefore, since the left side approaches 0, by sandwich theorem, h(x) approaches 0 from above.\n\nWhen h(x) <0: In this case, h(x) is in (-1,0). Then h(x)+1 is in (0,1). So h(x)^2/(h(x)+1) = positive number. Also, since h(x) is negative, h(x) < h(x)^2/(h(x)+1). But we need to bound |h(x)|. Let's see:\n\nLet’s let h(x) = -k(x), where k(x) ∈ (0,1). Then the expression becomes [k(x)^2]/[1 -k(x)]. We need to relate this to k(x). Let's see:\n\n[k(x)^2]/[1 -k(x)] = k(x)^2 / (1 -k(x)). Since 1 -k(x) <1 (because k(x) >0), so [k(x)^2]/[1 -k(x)] > k(x)^2. But this doesn't directly relate to k(x). However, we know that [k(x)^2]/[1 -k(x)] →0 as x→0. So for this to go to 0, since the denominator approaches 1 (if k(x)→0), then k(x)^2 must approach 0, hence k(x)→0. Therefore, h(x) = -k(x) →0.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that k(x) does not approach 0. Then there exists ε>0 such that k(x) ≥ε infinitely often. Then [k(x)^2]/[1 -k(x)] ≥ ε^2/(1 -ε) >0, which contradicts the limit. Therefore, k(x) must approach 0, so h(x) approaches 0.\n\nTherefore, combining both cases, h(x) approaches 0, so f(x) =1 +h(x) approaches 1.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to set y = f(x). Then y +1/y =2. The equation y +1/y =2 implies y=1. Because y +1/y ≥2 by AM ≥GM, equality when y=1. So if the limit of y +1/y is 2, then the limit of y must be 1. But we have to be careful because this is a limit, not that y +1/y is always 2. So we need to show that if the limit of y +1/y is 2, then the limit of y is 1.\n\nSuppose lim_{x→0} y(x) = L. Then lim_{x→0} y(x) +1/y(x) = L +1/L =2. Solving L +1/L =2 gives L=1. But this assumes that the limit of y(x) exists. However, the problem doesn't assume that the limit of y(x) exists; we have to prove that it exists and equals 1.\n\nSo another way: Suppose that lim_{x→0} (y +1/y) =2. We need to show lim y=1. Suppose not. Then there exists sequences x_n →0 such that y(x_n) does not converge to 1. But for each x_n, y(x_n) +1/y(x_n) →2. Let’s take such a sequence. Let’s say y_n = y(x_n). Then y_n +1/y_n →2. Then (y_n -1)^2 / y_n = y_n +1/y_n -2 →0. So (y_n -1)^2 / y_n →0. Since y_n >0, denominator y_n is positive. So (y_n -1)^2 →0, which implies y_n →1. Therefore, every sequence y(x_n) must converge to1, so lim_{x→0} y(x)=1.\n\nThis might be a cleaner approach. Because if for any sequence x_n →0, y(x_n) converges to some L, then L +1/L=2, so L=1. If y(x_n) does not converge, but y(x_n) +1/y(x_n) converges to2, then we can show that all subsequences of y(x_n) must converge to1, hence the limit exists and is1.\n\nSo the key is that if y_n +1/y_n →2, then y_n →1.\n\nTherefore, maybe this approach is better. The user tried to use substitution h(x)=f(x)-1, which is correct, but maybe got stuck in the bounds. The alternate approach is to note that the equation implies that (f(x)-1)^2 /f(x) tends to0, which then implies f(x) tends to1.\n\nBut perhaps to make it rigorous, we need to argue that (f(x)-1)^2 /f(x) →0 implies (f(x)-1)^2 →0 because f(x) is bounded away from 0 and infinity. Since f(x) approaches1, so for x near0, f(x) is between, say,1/2 and2. Then 1/f(x) is bounded, so (f(x)-1)^2 /f(x) →0 implies (f(x)-1)^2 →0, hence f(x)-1→0.\n\nBut how do we know f(x) is bounded? Because if f(x) approaches infinity, then f(x) +1/f(x) approaches infinity, contradicting the limit of2. Similarly, if f(x) approaches0, then1/f(x) approaches infinity, again contradicting the limit. Therefore, f(x) must be bounded and bounded away from0 near0. Hence, there exist constants a,b>0 such that0 <a ≤f(x) ≤b near0. Then 1/f(x) is also bounded. So (f(x)-1)^2 /f(x) ≥ (f(x)-1)^2 /b, and since this tends to0, then (f(x)-1)^2 →0, so f(x)→1.\n\nThis seems like a better way. Therefore, the user's original approach can be completed by noting that since the expression (h(x)^2)/(1 +h(x)) tends to0, and 1 +h(x) =f(x) is between a and b near0, then h(x)^2 ≤ (h(x)^2)/(1 +h(x)) * (1 +h(x)) ≤ C * (h(x)^2)/(1 +h(x)) →0, so h(x)^2 →0, hence h(x)→0.\n\nSo the key step is recognizing that 1 +h(x) is bounded away from0, hence the denominator doesn't cause issues, allowing us to conclude that h(x)^2 →0, hence h(x)→0.",
