    "Content": "Color every point in the real plane using the colors blue,yellow only. It can be shown that there exists a rectangle that has all vertices with the same color. Is it possible to show that there exists a square that has all vertices with the same color ? If it is not possible, please give me an example of a coloring of the real plane that does not have monochromatic squares. To give the viewers an idea about other similar results (which they might find useful), for any coloring (2 colors) of the real plane: 1) There exists three collinear points having the same color, such that one of the points is the midpoint of the line segment that joins the other two. 2)For any two angles $\\theta,\\phi$ there exists a monochromatic triangle that has angles $\\theta,\\phi,180-(\\theta+\\phi)$ 3)For any angle $\\theta$, there exists a monochromatic parallelogram with angle $\\theta$ Now its natural to ask if there are any monochromatic squares. Thank you",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Molina, Oza, and Puttagunta, Sane bounds on Van der Waerden-type numbers, write, The following is known: no matter how the lattice points of a coordinate plane are colored red and blue, there exists a square whose corners are the same color (a monochromatic square). In fact, using more than just two colors will still guarantee a monochromatic square (one whose vertices are the same color). So for all $c$ (the number of colors), there is a number $G(c)$ where all colorings with $c$ colors of the lattice points of a $G(c) \\times G(c)$ grid will contain a monochromatic square. Unfortunately, the necessary number of points is unknown, but bounds are known. These bounds are enormous (roughly $G(c)\\le2^{2^c}\\times2^{2^{2^{2^{2c}}}}$). The references they cite are W.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about whether a monochromatic square exists in any two-coloring of the real plane. The user also mentions some similar results but wants the problem to be formatted with assumptions and the problem statement clearly separated.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem states that every point in the real plane is colored either blue or yellow. So that's the first assumption. The user also mentions that it's already known that there exists a monochromatic rectangle, but the question is about a square. The original problem doesn't specify any additional constraints beyond the two-coloring, so maybe there's an implicit assumption that the coloring is arbitrary but only uses two colors. However, the example provided in the original problem (the one with A(n)) included an assumption about n being divisible by 7, but here, the problem seems more general. Wait, the example might have had that assumption because the original problem might have had it, but in this case, the question is more about whether such a square exists for any coloring, or if not, to provide a counterexample.\n\nWait, the problem is asking two things: 1) Is it possible to show there's a monochromatic square in any two-coloring? 2) If not, provide a coloring that doesn't have monochromatic squares. So the assumptions here are just the two-coloring of the plane. The problem is to either prove the existence or provide a counterexample.\n\nSo the assumptions should be:\n\n- The real plane is colored using two colors (blue and yellow).\n- Each point in the real plane is assigned one of the two colors.\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"Color every point in the real plane using the colors blue, yellow only.\" So that's the main assumption. There are no other restrictions on the coloring; it's arbitrary as long as only two colors are used. The problem then is whether such a coloring must necessarily contain a monochromatic square, or if there exists a coloring without such squares.\n\nSo following the example format, the assumptions are each one property applied to one object. Here, the objects are the points in the real plane and the coloring. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nEvery point in the real plane is colored blue or yellow.\n\nThat's the main assumption. Since each point is colored, and only two colors are used. Then the problem is to determine if there exists a monochromatic square under this coloring, or to provide an example where such squares don't exist.\n\nWait, but the example given in the user's example had two assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Here, the problem is about the plane being colored with two colors. So maybe the assumptions here are:\n\nAssumption:\nThe real plane is colored with two colors (blue and yellow).\n\nBut the user's example listed each assumption on a separate line. But in this case, there's only one assumption: that the plane is two-colored. However, maybe breaking it down into two parts:\n\nAssumption:\nThe real plane is colored,\nEach point is assigned either blue or yellow.\n\nBut perhaps the first part is redundant. Alternatively, maybe \"Color every point in the real plane using the colors blue, yellow only.\" can be split into two assumptions:\n\n- Every point in the real plane is colored.\n- Only the colors blue and yellow are used.\n\nBut the original problem's example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. So here, if the problem is that the entire plane is colored, and each point is colored either blue or yellow, maybe those are two separate assumptions. But in the original problem statement, the user wrote \"Color every point in the real plane using the colors blue,yellow only.\" So perhaps splitting that into two:\n\n- Every point in the real plane is colored.\n- The colors used are only blue and yellow.\n\nBut maybe the first is redundant because the second already implies that every point is colored with those two. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's just one assumption. The example given by the user had two assumptions for the problem, but in this case, perhaps only one.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\" but the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem's answer required that n is divisible by 7. So perhaps the user's example included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, no. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, but the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem includes \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That suggests that perhaps the user made a mistake in the example, or perhaps the original problem had a typo. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to show how to structure even if the original problem's assumptions are modified. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. But in any case, the user's instruction is to structure the problem by extracting the assumptions from the given problem, not necessarily adding new ones. So perhaps in the example, the original problem had a mistake, but in our current problem, we need to extract the correct assumptions.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question is: Color every point in the real plane using the colors blue, yellow only. Then asks whether there's a monochromatic square. So the assumptions here are:\n\n- The entire real plane is colored.\n- Only two colors (blue and yellow) are used.\n- Each point is colored with one of the two colors.\n\nBut perhaps the key assumptions are that it's a two-coloring of the plane. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe real plane is two-colored (using blue and yellow).\n\nBut according to the user's example format, each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nEvery point in the real plane is colored,\nThe color of each point is either blue or yellow.\n\nThat way, each line addresses one aspect. The first line states that every point is colored (as opposed to some being uncolored), and the second line restricts the colors to two.\n\nThen the problem is to show whether such a coloring must contain a monochromatic square, or provide a counterexample.\n\nAdditionally, the original problem mentions similar results, but those are just context and should be filtered out as per the user's instruction to \"filtered the unrelated informations\". So the problem statement should only contain the core question.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nEvery point in the real plane is colored,\nEach point is colored either blue or yellow.\n\nProblem:\nIs it possible to show that there exists a square with all vertices of the same color? If not, provide an example of a two-coloring of the real plane without monochromatic squares.\n\nWait, but the original problem states \"It can be shown that there exists a rectangle that has all vertices with the same color. Is it possible to show that there exists a square that has all vertices with the same color ? If it is not possible, please give me an example of a coloring of the real plane that does not have monochromatic squares.\"\n\nSo the problem is two-fold: either prove existence or provide a counterexample. So the problem statement should encapsulate that.\n\nBut in the example provided by the user, the problem was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" So here, the problem is to either prove existence or provide a counterexample. But how to phrase that concisely.\n\nMaybe:\n\nProblem:\nDetermine whether every two-coloring of the real plane contains a monochromatic square, and if not, provide a counterexample.\n\nBut the original question is phrased as a yes/no with a request for an example if not. Alternatively, following the original wording:\n\nProblem:\nIs it possible to show that there exists a square with all vertices of the same color? If not, provide an example of a two-coloring of the real plane without monochromatic squares.\n\nBut perhaps the problem statement should be more direct, like \"Prove or disprove: Every two-coloring of the real plane contains a monochromatic square.\" But the original question is phrased as asking for either a proof or a counterexample. So maybe:\n\nProblem:\nProve that every two-coloring of the real plane contains a monochromatic square, or provide an example of a two-coloring that does not have monochromatic squares.\n\nBut I need to check the user's example. In their example, the problem was restated as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" So they took the core problem from the original and structured it. Similarly, here, the core problem is asking whether a monochromatic square exists in any two-coloring, and if not, provide a coloring. So the problem statement would be:\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a square with all vertices of the same color in any two-coloring of the real plane, or provide an example of a coloring without such squares.\n\nBut maybe to make it more concise, following the structure of the example:\n\nProblem:\nProve that every two-coloring of the real plane contains a monochromatic square, or provide a counterexample.\n\nBut the example's problem was just \"Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" So here, the problem is to do either proof or counterexample. However, the user's format seems to require the problem to be stated as a single statement. The original problem is phrased as a question, but perhaps in the formatted version, it's better to make it an imperative.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is asking two things (either prove existence or provide a counterexample), maybe it's better to present it as:\n\nProblem:\nDetermine whether every two-coloring of the real plane contains a monochromatic square. If not, provide an example of such a coloring without monochromatic squares.\n\nBut the example in the user's instruction had the problem as \"Prove that ... is divisible by 91.\" So perhaps in this case, the problem should be structured as a statement to prove or disprove.\n\nAlternatively, the original question is \"Is it possible to show that there exists a square... If it is not possible, please give me an example...\" So the problem is to either show existence or provide a counterexample. So the problem statement would be:\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a monochromatic square in any two-coloring of the real plane, or provide a coloring of the plane without monochromatic squares.\n\nYes, that seems accurate. So putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nEvery point in the real plane is colored,\nEach point is colored either blue or yellow.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a square with all vertices of the same color in any two-coloring of the real plane, or provide an example of such a coloring without monochromatic squares.\n\nBut the user's example had each assumption on a separate line. Let me check:\n\nIn the example, the assumptions were:\n\nAssumption:\n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\n\nSo each assumption is a separate line. So in this case, the two assumptions are:\n\n- Every point in the real plane is colored.\n\n- Each point is colored either blue or yellow.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe real plane is colored with two colors (blue and yellow),\nEvery point is assigned one of the two colors.\n\nBut the original problem states \"Color every point in the real plane using the colors blue,yellow only.\" So perhaps the two assumptions are:\n\n- Every point in the real plane is colored.\n\n- Only the colors blue and yellow are used.\n\nYes, that's two separate conditions: completeness of coloring (no uncolored points) and restriction to two colors.\n\nSo the formatted assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nEvery point in the real plane is colored,\nOnly the colors blue and yellow are used.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a square with all vertices of the same color, or provide an example of a coloring of the real plane without monochromatic squares.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"If it is not possible, please give me an example of a coloring...\". So the problem is to either prove the existence or provide a counterexample.\n\nTherefore, the problem statement in the formatted version should encapsulate both possibilities. Hence:\n\nProblem:\nProve that every two-coloring of the real plane contains a monochromatic square, or provide an example of a two-coloring without monochromatic squares.\n\nAlternatively, following the original wording more closely:\n\nProblem:\nIs it possible to show that there exists a monochromatic square in any two-coloring of the real plane? If not, provide an example of such a coloring without monochromatic squares.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the problem statement is a direct imperative (\"Prove that...\"), so perhaps rephrase the question as an imperative:\n\nProblem:\nProve that every two-coloring of the real plane contains a monochromatic square, or provide a counterexample.\n\nBut I think the user wants the problem to be stated as it is, but structured. So perhaps:\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a square with all vertices of the same color in any two-coloring of the real plane, or provide an example of a coloring without such squares.\n\nYes, that combines both parts of the original question into a single problem statement.\n\nSo to recap, the assumptions are:\n\n1. Every point in the real plane is colored.\n2. Only blue and yellow are used for coloring.\n\nAnd the problem is to prove existence or provide a counterexample.\n\nI think this should be the correct formatting.",
