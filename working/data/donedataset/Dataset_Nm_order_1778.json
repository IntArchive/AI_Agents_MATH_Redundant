    "Content": "$$\\begin{pmatrix}1&1\\\\1&0\\end{pmatrix}^n=\\begin{pmatrix}F_{n+1}&F_n\\\\F_n&F_{n-1}\\end{pmatrix}$$ Somebody has any idea how to go about proving this result? I know a proof by mathematical induction, but that, in my opinion, will be a verification of this result only. I tried to find through the net, but in vain, if someone has some link or pointer to its proof, please provide, I'll appreciate that. Thanks a lot!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "(I'm assuming here that what the OP really wants is to know how one would ever get the idea to try to prove this. He already has a proof by induction, which is a perfectly valid and respectable proof method; you won't get anything proofier than that, except perhaps methods that hide the induction within a general theorem). One way to invent this relation is to start from the following fairly simple algorithm for computing Fibonacci numbers: Start by setting $a=0$, $b=1$ Repeat the following until you reach the $F_n$ you want: ( Invariant: $a=F_{n-1}$ and $b=F_n$). Set $c=a+b$ (Now $c=F_{n+1}$) $a\\leftarrow b$ and $b \\leftarrow c$. Now observe that the loop body computes the new $a$ and $b$ as linear combinations of the old $a$ and $b$. Therefore there's a matrix that represents each turn through the loop. Many turns through the loop become multiplication with a power of the matrix. This reasoning gives you the matrix $M=\\pmatrix{1&1\\\\1&0}$ and an informal argument that $M^n \\pmatrix{1\\\\0} = \\pmatrix{F_n\\\\F_\n{n-1}}$. This gives us one column of $M^n$, and it is reasonable to hope that the other one will also be something about Fibonacci numbers. One can either repeat the previous argument with different starting $a$ and $b$, or simply compute the first few powers of $M$ by hand and then recognize the pattern to be proved formally later.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me first read the original question carefully. The user is asking about proving that the nth power of the matrix [[1,1],[1,0]] equals the matrix with Fibonacci entries [[F_{n+1}, F_n], [F_n, F_{n-1}]]. They mention knowing a proof by induction but are looking for alternative methods, possibly wanting a more insightful approach rather than just verification.\n\nNow, applying the format. The example given lists assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. In the original example, they had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in this problem, the user's question doesn't explicitly state any assumptions beyond what's in the matrix equation. Let me think.\n\nThe problem is to prove the equality for the matrix raised to the nth power. The key assumptions here would relate to the definitions involved. The Fibonacci sequence is defined with certain initial conditions. The matrix multiplication is defined as usual. So the assumptions would include things like:\n\n1. The Fibonacci sequence is defined with F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1, and F_{n} = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} for n ≥ 2.\n2. The matrix multiplication follows standard rules.\n3. The exponentiation of the matrix is done through repeated multiplication.\n\nBut wait, the problem as stated doesn't mention the Fibonacci definition; it's implicit in the context. However, to structure the problem correctly, we need to list all necessary assumptions. The user is assuming that the reader knows the Fibonacci recurrence, but perhaps we should state that as an assumption. Alternatively, maybe the problem is self-contained as the matrix equality is stated, and the Fibonacci numbers are part of the problem statement. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at the example given, the original problem had an expression involving 5^n and 6^n, and the formatted problem included assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. But in the user's problem here, the only assumption needed is that n is a non-negative integer (since Fibonacci numbers are typically defined for n ≥ 0 or 1). However, the problem might not even state that n is an integer, but in the context of matrix exponentiation, n is a non-negative integer. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- n is a non-negative integer.\n- The Fibonacci sequence is defined as F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1, and F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} for n ≥ 2.\n\nBut the original problem statement doesn't mention the Fibonacci definition; it's part of the problem's background knowledge. However, to structure the problem correctly, perhaps the key assumptions are that the matrix is being raised to the nth power and that the entries follow the Fibonacci recurrence. Wait, the problem is to prove that the matrix power equals the given Fibonacci matrix. So the assumptions would be the definitions of the Fibonacci numbers and the matrix exponentiation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem as stated doesn't have explicit assumptions beyond the matrix equation. The user is asking for a proof of that equation. So perhaps the only assumption is that n is a positive integer (since matrix powers are defined for integers n ≥ 1). But the example given included assumptions even if they were part of the problem's inherent definitions. Wait, in the example, the original problem stated \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem incorrectly added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like a mistake. Because the original problem didn't have that assumption. Wait, looking back at the user's example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n (3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut that's incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption shouldn't include that n is divisible by 7. That example might be a mistake. Therefore, perhaps the user wants to extract assumptions from the problem statement, but in the example, it's incorrect. So maybe the correct approach is to list any inherent assumptions necessary for the problem to hold. For the Fibonacci matrix problem, the key assumption is that n is a non-negative integer, and the Fibonacci sequence is defined with the standard recurrence. However, since the problem is to prove the matrix equality, the assumptions needed are:\n\n1. The matrix multiplication is defined as standard.\n2. The Fibonacci numbers are defined by F_{n} = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} for n ≥ 2 with initial conditions F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1.\n3. The exponent n is a non-negative integer.\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't mention the initial conditions, so perhaps including them as assumptions is necessary. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the reader knows the Fibonacci definition, but to structure it properly, we need to list all necessary conditions. Therefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nThe Fibonacci sequence is defined by F₀ = 0, F₁ = 1, and Fₙ = Fₙ₋₁ + Fₙ₋₂ for n ≥ 2,\nn is a non-negative integer,\nmatrix exponentiation is performed by repeated multiplication.\n\nBut maybe the problem doesn't require all these. Let me check the original problem again. The user wrote:\n\n\"Prove that $$\\begin{pmatrix}1&1\\\\1&0\\end{pmatrix}^n=\\begin{pmatrix}F_{n+1}&F_n\\\\F_n&F_{n-1}\\end{pmatrix}$$\"\n\nSo the problem is to show that raising the matrix to the nth power gives that Fibonacci matrix. The user mentions knowing induction but wants another proof. The problem as stated doesn't specify the domain of n (like non-negative integers), but matrix powers are typically defined for non-negative integers. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is a non-negative integer.\n- The Fibonacci numbers are defined with F_{n} = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} for n ≥ 2 and F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list these as assumptions. Each assumption on a separate line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a non-negative integer,\nThe Fibonacci sequence satisfies F₀ = 0, F₁ = 1, and Fₙ = Fₙ₋₁ + Fₙ₋₂ for n ≥ 2.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$\\begin{pmatrix}1&1\\\\1&0\\end{pmatrix}^n=\\begin{pmatrix}F_{n+1}&F_n\\\\F_n&F_{n-1}\\end{pmatrix}$$.\n\nYes, that seems correct. The initial conditions for Fibonacci are necessary because the matrix equality involves F_{n-1}, which for n=0 would be F_{-1}, but perhaps the problem assumes n ≥ 1. Wait, but the user wrote the matrix as having F_{n-1}, so n must be at least 1. But if n is a non-negative integer, then for n=0, the matrix power is the identity matrix, which would be [[1,0],[0,1]], and the right-hand side would be [[F_1, F_0],[F_0, F_{-1}]]. But F_{-1} is not standard unless extended. This suggests that the problem might implicitly assume n ≥ 1. However, the standard Fibonacci sequence is defined for n ≥ 0, and sometimes extended to negative n, but the problem might not require that. Therefore, perhaps the assumption is that n is a positive integer. Let me check the original problem again. The user's question title writes the matrix equality as shown, and in the question body, they mention knowing induction but wanting another proof. The problem likely assumes n is a non-negative integer, but when n=0, the identity matrix would correspond to [[1,0],[0,1]], and the right-hand side would be [[F_1, F_0],[F_0, F_{-1}]]. Since F_{-1} is 1 in some extensions, but standardly, maybe the problem is intended for n ≥ 1. Hmm. This is a bit ambiguous, but perhaps the problem assumes n is a positive integer. Therefore, the assumption should be n is a positive integer. Alternatively, to include n=0, maybe the Fibonacci sequence is defined for all integers, but that's more complex. Given that the user is asking for a proof, and standard proofs by induction start at n=1, perhaps the assumption is n is a positive integer. However, the example given in the user's instruction included \"n is an integer\" even when the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So maybe in this case, the assumption is simply that n is an integer, but given that matrix powers are for non-negative integers, perhaps specifying n is a non-negative integer. I think the correct approach here is to list:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a non-negative integer,\nThe Fibonacci sequence is defined by F₀ = 0, F₁ = 1, and Fₙ = Fₙ₋₁ + Fₙ₋₂ for n ≥ 2.\n\nThis covers the necessary definitions and the domain of n. Even though for n=0, F_{-1} would be needed, but maybe the problem assumes a particular extension or the user is okay with that. Alternatively, the problem might be intended for n ≥ 1, but the user didn't specify. Given that the problem statement as written includes F_{n-1}, to make sense for all non-negative integers n, perhaps n starts at 1, making n-1 ≥ 0. Therefore, perhaps the assumption should be n is a positive integer. But without more context, it's safer to stick with the standard Fibonacci definition starting at F₀, and assume n is a non-negative integer, even if that leads to F_{-1} when n=0. However, in the matrix exponentiation, when n=0, the identity matrix would need to match the right-hand side. For n=0, the right-hand side would be [[F_1, F_0],[F_0, F_{-1}]]. If we define F_{-1} as 1 (which is a common extension), then the matrix becomes [[1,0],[0,1]], which matches the identity matrix. Therefore, perhaps the problem includes this definition. So including the assumption that the Fibonacci numbers are defined for all integers n, including negative ones, with F_{-1} = 1. But that's complicating. Alternatively, the problem is intended for n ≥ 1, and the user didn't specify. Since the problem statement doesn't mention the domain, but the matrix equation must hold for the exponent n, it's safer to list the assumptions as:\n\n- n is a non-negative integer.\n- The Fibonacci sequence is defined by F₀ = 0, F₁ = 1, and Fₙ = Fₙ₋₁ + Fₙ₋₂ for n ≥ 2.\n\nEven if n=0 leads to F_{-1}, but perhaps in the context of the problem, that's acceptable with F_{-1} defined as 1. Alternatively, maybe the problem starts at n=1. But given that the user is asking for a proof, and induction typically starts at a base case, perhaps n=1. However, the problem as stated doesn't restrict n, so I'll proceed with the assumptions as above.",
