    "Content": "I have written a proof for the following and would like you to correct me if I made any mistakes, thanks in advance: Claim: $X = \\sqcup_i X_i$ then $H_q (X) \\cong \\oplus_i H_q (X_i)$ proof:\nProof of case $X = A \\sqcup B$ , the general case follows by induction. By the Mayer-Vietoris theorem the following sequence is exact: $$ \\dots \\xrightarrow{k_\\ast} H_{n+1}(X) \\xrightarrow{\\partial_\\ast} H_n(A \\cap B) \\xrightarrow{(i_\\ast, j_\\ast)}  H_n(A) \\oplus H_n(B) \\xrightarrow{k_\\ast} H_n(X)\\xrightarrow{\\partial_\\ast} \\dots$$ Then $A \\cap B = \\emptyset \\implies H_n(A \\cap B) = 0 \\implies \\partial_\\ast = 0$ Then $k_\\ast$ is injective because $ker k_\\ast = im \\partial_\\ast = 0$ and $k_\\ast $ is surjective because $im k_\\ast = ker \\partial_\\ast = H_n(X)$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Wouldn't be easier to argue like this? Since $\\Delta^n$ is connected, then the image of every continuous map $\\sigma : \\Delta^n \\longrightarrow \\bigsqcup_{\\alpha \\in J} X_\\alpha$ must be contained in some $X_\\alpha$: $\\sigma (\\Delta^n) \\subset X_\\alpha$. I didn't check the details, but I think that this would say that you can find an inverse to the universal map $$\n\\bigoplus_{\\alpha \\in J} H_p(X_\\alpha) \\longrightarrow H_p(\\bigsqcup_{\\alpha \\in J} X_\\alpha)\n$$ induced by the inclusions $X_\\alpha \\longrightarrow \\bigsqcup_{\\alpha \\in J} X_\\alpha$. And this would be true for any set of indices $J$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should list each condition applied to one object, and then the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the user was proving for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Maybe the example is incorrect? But perhaps I should follow the user's instruction regardless.\n\nNow, the problem given here is about homology of a disjoint union. The title is \"Homology of disjoint union is direct sum of homologies\". The user's question is about their proof using Mayer-Vietoris. They want others to check their proof. But the task is to structure the problem according to the format.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem is to show that for X being a disjoint union of Xi, the homology group Hq(X) is isomorphic to the direct sum of Hq(Xi). The user's proof considers the case X = A ⊔ B and uses Mayer-Vietoris, noting that A ∩ B is empty, leading to certain consequences in the exact sequence.\n\nSo the assumptions here would be:\n\n- X is the disjoint union of the spaces Xi.\n- The case considered is X = A ⊔ B (and general by induction).\n- A and B are disjoint (since their intersection is empty).\n- Using Mayer-Vietoris theorem's exact sequence.\n- H_n(A ∩ B) = 0 because A ∩ B is empty.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. So maybe list each assumption line by line.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- X is a topological space which is the disjoint union of spaces Xi.\n- A and B are subspaces of X with A ∪ B = X and A ∩ B = ∅.\n- The Mayer-Vietoris theorem is applicable to the pair (A, B).\n- The homology groups involved are singular homology groups.\n- The intersection A ∩ B is empty, hence its homology is zero.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is more general. The user is claiming that for any disjoint union, the homology is the direct sum. The proof is for two components and then induction. So the main assumption is that X is the disjoint union of Xi. Then, in their proof, they use Mayer-Vietoris with A and B being two components, whose intersection is empty. So perhaps the key assumptions are:\n\n- X is a disjoint union of topological spaces Xi.\n- For the case of two components, X = A ⊔ B.\n- A ∩ B = ∅.\n\nBut the problem statement the user is trying to prove is the general case. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a disjoint union of topological spaces Xi,\nEach Xi is a topological space,\nHomology groups are considered in singular homology,\nThe Mayer-Vietoris theorem applies to the decomposition X = A ⊔ B where A and B are open in X.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user is trying to prove Hq(X) ≅ ⊕Hq(Xi). The key assumptions would be the disjoint union and the properties needed for Mayer-Vietoris. But since the user's proof uses that A ∩ B is empty, leading to Hn(A ∩ B) = 0, which makes the maps in the exact sequence behave a certain way.\n\nSo to structure the problem as per the user's example, the assumptions would be the necessary conditions for the proof. But the problem is the original claim. So the problem is to prove that the homology of the disjoint union is the direct sum. The assumptions would include that X is a disjoint union of Xi, each Xi is a topological space, perhaps that the decomposition is such that A and B are open (for Mayer-Vietoris to apply). Wait, Mayer-Vietoris typically requires that the interiors of A and B cover X. But in a disjoint union, if you take A and B as two open sets partitioning X, that might be the case. So maybe the assumption is that X is the disjoint union of A and B, which are both open and closed in X. That would satisfy the conditions for Mayer-Vietoris.\n\nSo possible assumptions:\n\n- X is a topological space that is the disjoint union of two open subsets A and B.\n- A and B are topological spaces with the subspace topology from X.\n- The Mayer-Vietoris theorem applies to the pair (A, B).\n\nBut the problem's actual statement is more general, the disjoint union of any number of Xi. The user's proof handles two components and uses induction. However, in the problem statement, the user is asking to verify their proof. The problem they are working on is the claim that Hq(X) is isomorphic to the direct sum of Hq(Xi) when X is a disjoint union. Therefore, the problem is to prove that claim.\n\nSo structuring the problem:\n\nAssumptions would be the conditions needed for their approach. But according to the example, perhaps the assumptions are the given conditions in the problem. The original problem's claim is for any disjoint union, so the main assumption is that X is the disjoint union of the Xi. However, in the proof, the user splits into A and B, so maybe the assumption is that X is the disjoint union of two spaces A and B. Wait, but the general case is supposed to follow by induction, so maybe the base case is two spaces.\n\nBut the user is trying to prove the general case, so the problem statement is \"Prove that if X is the disjoint union of spaces Xi, then Hq(X) is isomorphic to the direct sum of Hq(Xi)\".\n\nThe assumptions needed for this would be:\n\n- X is a topological space which is the disjoint union of subspaces Xi.\n- Each Xi is a topological space.\n- Homology groups are considered with coefficients in some ring (if unspecified, maybe integers).\n- The Mayer-Vietoris theorem applies to the decomposition of X into open subsets.\n\nBut since the user's proof uses that A ∩ B is empty, leading to Hn(A ∩ B) = 0, so perhaps the key assumption is that the spaces are disjoint in X. So the main assumption is that X is the disjoint union of the Xi, hence each Xi is a clopen subset in X. Then, Mayer-Vietoris can be applied when decomposing X into two such clopen subsets.\n\nSo translating to the format:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a topological space,\nX is the disjoint union of subspaces Xi,\nEach Xi is a clopen subset in X,\nHomology groups are singular homology groups.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $H_q (X) \\cong \\oplus_i H_q (X_i)$.\n\nBut in the example given by the user, the assumption included conditions that were perhaps not all explicitly stated but inferred. For instance, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which seems like an error. However, the user might have intended to structure the problem with the necessary assumptions. But in the current case, the user's original problem doesn't state additional assumptions beyond X being a disjoint union. The user's proof uses Mayer-Vietoris, which requires that A and B are open in X. So in order for their approach to work, X must be decomposed into open subsets. Hence, the assumption that each Xi is open in X (if X is the disjoint union, then each Xi is both open and closed if the union is disjoint and each Xi is a subspace). Therefore, maybe the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a topological space,\nX is the disjoint union of open subsets Xi,\nEach Xi is a topological subspace of X,\nHomology is computed using singular homology.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $H_q (X) \\cong \\oplus_i H_q (X_i)$.\n\nBut the original problem's claim doesn't specify openness, so perhaps the key is that X is the disjoint union as a topological space, which automatically makes each Xi clopen. So the main assumption is X is the disjoint union of subspaces Xi, and each Xi is open in X. Then the problem is to prove the homology is the direct sum.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's proof is incorrect because Mayer-Vietoris applies to two open sets covering X, but if you have a disjoint union of more than two, induction might not directly apply. However, the user's approach is to first do two components, then use induction. But perhaps the main assumption is just that X is a disjoint union, and the rest are standard in singular homology.\n\nSo the structured problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a topological space,\nX is the disjoint union of its subspaces Xi,\nEach Xi is a topological space,\nThe homology groups considered are singular homology groups.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $H_q (X) \\cong \\bigoplus_i H_q (X_i)$.\n\nBut in the example given by the user, the assumptions listed specific conditions like \"n is an integer\", \"n is divisible by 7\". So each assumption is a single line, each about one object. So here, each line should address a single property of one object.\n\nSo breaking down:\n\n- X is a topological space.\n- X is the disjoint union of the subspaces Xi.\n- Each Xi is a topological space.\n- The homology functor Hq is applied to each space.\n- The direct sum is taken over the homology groups of each Xi.\n\nBut perhaps more precisely, the key assumption is that X is the disjoint union (coproduct in Top) of the spaces Xi. So in topology, the disjoint union is formed by taking the disjoint union of the underlying sets and giving it the coproduct topology, where each Xi is open and closed. So this makes each Xi a clopen subset. Hence, for the Mayer-Vietoris sequence, if we take two such clopen subsets A and B, their intersection is empty, so the sequence simplifies.\n\nHence, structuring the problem:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a topological space,\nX is the disjoint union of topological spaces {Xi}i∈I,\nEach Xi is a clopen subset of X,\nHomology groups Hq are singular homology groups.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $H_q(X) \\cong \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} H_q(X_i)$.\n\nBut the original problem's title and the user's proof don't mention clopen, but in the case of disjoint union, the Xi are both open and closed. So perhaps that's an implicit assumption. But maybe in the problem statement, the user doesn't need to specify that each Xi is clopen because that's part of the definition of the disjoint union topology.\n\nHence, the main assumptions are:\n\n- X is the disjoint union of the spaces Xi.\n- Each Xi is a topological space.\n\nThen the problem is to prove the homology is the direct sum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's problem is to prove this for singular homology, so the assumption is that we're working in the category of topological spaces with singular homology.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions are listed line by line, each about one object. So for this problem:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a topological space,\n{Xi}i∈I is a collection of topological spaces,\nX is the disjoint union of {Xi}i∈I,\nHomology groups Hq are considered in singular homology.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $H_q(X) \\cong \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} H_q(X_i)$.\n\nYes, this seems to fit. Each assumption is one line, addressing one property. The problem is the statement to prove.",
