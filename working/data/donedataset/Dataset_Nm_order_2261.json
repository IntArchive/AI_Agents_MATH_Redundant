    "Content": "In Michael Artin's Algebra textbook page 484 Chapter 12 Exercise 1.6: A module is called simple if it is not the zero module and if it has no proper submodule. (a) Prove that any simple module is isomorphic to R/M, where M is a maximal ideal. My questions are: Is $R/M$ a left module over $R$? or over itself $R/M$? When we defined a module $N$ we defined a map $R\\times N\\to N$ where $R$ is a ring and $N$ is an Abelian group. Now let the ring $R$ be $M$ as given in question, where $M$ is a maximal ideal of $R$. So the map becomes \n$M\\times N\\to N$. As far as I know, there no equivalent notion of ideal in module. The reason I said that is because from the definition of quotient module $V/W$, $W$ is just a submodule of $V$, not an \"ideal\" submodule of $V$. Is my reasoning correct? If my reasoning in 2. above is wrong, then how can we interpret a maximal ideal in a language of module? Is there a definition of maximal ideal in module distinct to definition of a maximal ideal in ring? To prove the question, I consulted other sources in the internet. There is a proof that says \"Any submodule of $R/M$ is an ideal, since it would be an additive group that is closed under multiplication by elements of $R$ and therefore $R/M$.\" Since I am still not clear of the definition of ideal in module, I am confused by the meaning of the above statement, especially what does it mean by \"closed under multiplication by elements of R and therefore $R/M$\"? Thank you very much for any helps. I really appreciate it.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "An right $R$ module is, as you said, an abelian group $N$ and the map from $N\\times R\\to N$ satisfying special properties like distributivity etc. In other words, $nr$ is another element of $N$ for every $n\\in N$, and $r\\in R$. If $N'$ is an additive subgroup of $N$, we say that it's a submodule if $n'r\\in N'$ for every $n'\\in N'$ and $r\\in R$. In other words, it looks like $N'R\\subseteq N'$ (which didn't necessarily have to happen!). Now $R$ can be considered as a right module over itself, since the ring multiplication $R\\times R\\to R$ satisfies all the axioms that are necessary to make $R$ into a right module. Since we have already defined what a submodule is, we can ask what the submodules of the right module $R$ are. They an additive subgroup $I$ of $R$ is a submodule if $IR\\subseteq I$. You'll notice that looks like the definition of a right ideal: and that's exactly what it is! The term \"right ideal\" is just another term for a submodule of the right module $R$. Similarly, $R$ can be considered as a left module over itself, and you can ask about its left submodules (=left ideals). Nobody says \"ideals in a module\" because ideals are reserved as a term for submodules of $R$. If you already know that for any submodule $N'$ of $N$ you can form the quotient module $N/N'$, then it will be no surprise that if $M$ is a right ideal (=right submodule!) of $R$, then you can form the quotient module $R/M$. The proof of the title fact is very easy if you know the isomorphism theorems for modules. If $S$ is a right $R$ module (nonzero, of course), pick a nonzero $s\\in S$ and make a map from $R\\to S$ by $r\\mapsto sr$. Call this map $\\phi$. This is clearly a nonzero map to $S$. Since the image is a submodule of $S$ and $S$ is simple, it must be all of $S$. By the isomorphism theorem, $R/\\ker(\\phi)\\cong Im(\\phi)=S$. By the correspondence of submodules, the absence of submodules of $S$ corresponds to an absence of submodules between $R$ and $\\ker(\\phi)$, and so $\\ker(\\phi)$ is a maximal right ideal of $R$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this question. The user is working on a problem from Artin's Algebra, specifically about simple modules. The main task is to prove that any simple module is isomorphic to R/M where M is a maximal ideal. But the user has several related questions about the structure of R/M as a module and the role of ideals in modules.\n\nFirst, the user is confused whether R/M is a left R-module or a module over itself. From what I remember, when you take a quotient ring R/M, it naturally has a structure as an R-module. The action of R on R/M is just left multiplication, right? Since M is an ideal, the multiplication is well-defined. So R/M is indeed a left R-module. But it's also a ring in itself because M is a maximal ideal, making R/M a field (if R is commutative). However, the problem is about modules, so the key point here is that R/M is a simple R-module.\n\nNext, the user questions the definition of ideals in modules. The user is correct that modules have submodules, not ideals. Ideals are specific to rings. So when the user mentions that in the proof they found, it says \"any submodule of R/M is an ideal,\" that seems confusing. Wait, but R/M is a ring as well. If we consider R/M as a module over itself, then its submodules would correspond to its ideals. But in the context of R-modules, the submodules of R/M (as an R-module) are different. Since R/M is a simple R-module, it has no proper submodules. However, if you consider R/M as a ring (a field), then it has no non-trivial ideals. The confusion might come from mixing the two structures: R/M as an R-module versus R/M as a ring.\n\nThe user also quotes a statement: \"Any submodule of R/M is an ideal, since it would be an additive group that is closed under multiplication by elements of R and therefore R/M.\" This seems a bit unclear. If we think of R/M as an R-module, then a submodule would be a subset closed under addition and scalar multiplication by elements of R. But since R/M is simple as an R-module, the only submodules are 0 and itself. However, if someone is talking about ideals in the ring R/M, those would be subsets closed under multiplication by elements of R/M. But since R/M is a field (if R is commutative and M is maximal), it has no non-trivial ideals. So the statement might be trying to say that in the context of the R-module structure, any submodule is also an ideal of the ring R/M, but that might not hold unless the module structure and ring structure are compatible in a specific way. This part is a bit confusing and might be where the user is getting stuck.\n\nSo, to structure the problem according to the required format, the main problem is part (a) from the exercise: Prove that any simple module is isomorphic to R/M where M is a maximal ideal. The assumptions need to be listed line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object.\n\nLooking at the example given, the original problem had assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, leading to the problem statement. Here, in the current question, the key assumptions would be:\n\n- A module is simple if it is not the zero module and has no proper submodules.\n- M is a maximal ideal of R.\n- R/M is considered as a left R-module.\n\nBut wait, the problem itself is to prove that any simple module is isomorphic to R/M with M maximal. The user's questions revolve around clarifying the structure of R/M as a module and the role of ideals. However, the actual problem to be formatted is part (a), which is the main problem, while the user's questions are their own confusions. The task here is to extract the problem as per the original exercise and list its assumptions.\n\nSo, the original problem (a) is: Prove that any simple module is isomorphic to R/M, where M is a maximal ideal.\n\nThe assumptions for this problem would be:\n\n- A module is simple if it is not the zero module and has no proper submodules.\n- M is a maximal ideal of R.\n- R is a ring with identity (assuming this from context, as Artin's book likely deals with rings with identity).\n- The quotient R/M is considered as a left R-module.\n\nBut in Artin's book, modules are typically left modules unless specified otherwise. So perhaps the main assumptions here are that R is a ring, M is a maximal ideal of R, and the simple module in question is a left R-module. The problem is to show that such a module is isomorphic to R/M as R-modules.\n\nWait, but the problem statement in the user's question is part (a): \"Prove that any simple module is isomorphic to R/M, where M is a maximal ideal.\" The key here is that R/M is a left R-module. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- The module is simple (non-zero, no proper submodules).\n- M is a maximal ideal of R.\n- R is a ring (with 1, presumably).\n- The quotient R/M is considered as a left R-module.\n\nBut the problem as stated in the exercise doesn't include any additional conditions beyond the definition of a simple module. So perhaps the only assumption is that the module is simple, and then M is a maximal ideal. However, the problem is to show that any simple module is of the form R/M. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- The module is simple.\n- R is a ring with identity.\n- M is a maximal ideal of R.\n\nBut actually, the problem is to prove that any simple R-module is isomorphic to R/M for some maximal ideal M. So the key assumption is that we have a simple R-module, and the conclusion is that it's isomorphic to R/M. So the assumptions in the problem would be:\n\n- Let S be a simple R-module (i.e., S is non-zero and has no proper submodules).\n- R is a ring (with 1).\n\nBut the problem as stated by the user is: \"Prove that any simple module is isomorphic to R/M, where M is a maximal ideal.\" So the main assumptions are that we're working over a ring R, considering simple R-modules, and M is a maximal ideal. However, the problem may implicitly assume that R is commutative, but Artin's book deals with both commutative and non-commutative rings. However, in non-commutative cases, maximal ideals are replaced by maximal left/right ideals. Wait, here's a confusion point: in rings, maximal ideals are two-sided, but for modules, when you talk about R/M being a simple module, M needs to be a maximal left ideal. Because if R is not commutative, then a maximal ideal (two-sided) might not make R/M a simple module. For example, in a non-commutative ring, R/M where M is a maximal two-sided ideal might not be a simple module, because left submodules could exist. Therefore, perhaps the correct assumption is that M is a maximal left ideal, not a two-sided ideal.\n\nBut the user's problem states \"maximal ideal\", which in standard terminology is two-sided. However, in Artin's book, since he might be working in a context where rings are not necessarily commutative, but when talking about modules, he might refer to left ideals. Wait, checking the problem statement again: the user wrote \"M is a maximal ideal of R\". But in the standard terminology, in non-commutative rings, a maximal ideal is a two-sided ideal which is maximal among proper two-sided ideals. However, if we are to have R/M be a simple module, then M needs to be a maximal left ideal. Therefore, there's a discrepancy here. The user's problem might have a mistake, or perhaps in the context of the book, the ring is assumed to be commutative. Alternatively, maybe the problem is in the context of commutative rings, so maximal ideals are two-sided, and in that case, R/M is a field, hence a simple R-module.\n\nBut if R is commutative, then a maximal ideal M would make R/M a field, which is a simple ring and also a simple R-module. However, if R is not commutative, then R/M could be a simple ring if M is a maximal two-sided ideal, but R/M might not be a simple left R-module. For example, take R a simple ring (no two-sided ideals), then R/M is R/R=0, which isn't a simple module. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nIn any case, the problem as stated by the user says \"M is a maximal ideal\", so we have to go with that. But perhaps the correct approach is that in order for R/M to be a simple module, M must be a maximal left ideal. Hence, the problem may have a typo, or the user might have misstated it. However, since the user is directly quoting from Artin's book, page 484, Exercise 1.6(a), we need to check what Artin says. Since I don't have the book here, but based on standard knowledge, in the context of modules over rings, simple modules correspond to quotient by maximal left ideals. However, if the ring is commutative, then maximal left ideals are the same as maximal ideals. So perhaps in Artin's problem, R is assumed to be commutative, or he's using \"ideal\" to mean left ideal in this context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is correct as stated, but there's a different approach. If M is a maximal two-sided ideal, then R/M is a simple ring (if it's maximal as a two-sided ideal). But a simple ring can still have left modules. However, R/M as a left R-module may not be simple unless M is a maximal left ideal.\n\nThis is getting complicated, but since the user's main question is about the problem as stated, where M is a maximal ideal (presumably two-sided), but they are confused about whether R/M is a left R-module. So, to structure the problem:\n\nThe problem is to prove that any simple module is isomorphic to R/M where M is a maximal ideal. The assumptions here would be:\n\n- The module is simple (non-zero, no proper submodules).\n- M is a maximal ideal of R.\n- R is a ring (with identity).\n- The quotient R/M is considered as a left R-module.\n\nBut perhaps the key assumption is that M is a maximal left ideal, but the problem says \"maximal ideal\". This could be an error in the problem statement or a difference in terminology. However, given the user's direct quote, we must structure the problem as stated, even if there's a potential terminological issue. Therefore, the formatted problem would list the assumptions as:\n\nAssumption:\nA module is simple if it is not the zero module and has no proper submodules,\nM is a maximal ideal of R,\nR is a ring,\nR/M is considered as a left R-module.\n\nProblem:\nProve that any simple module is isomorphic to R/M where M is a maximal ideal.\n\nBut wait, the problem is general—it says \"any simple module\", so maybe the assumptions are about the simple module and the ring R. However, in the example given, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. In this case, the problem's assumptions would include the properties of the objects involved. Let me check the example again:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, in the example, the user added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the original problem states \"for every integer n\". That seems incorrect. Wait, no, the example might have been modified. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe example's original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\"\n\nThen the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut that contradicts the original problem's \"for every integer n\". So maybe there's a mistake in the example. However, perhaps the example was intended to show how to structure even if the original problem had an error. Alternatively, maybe the example is correct if the original problem had a missing condition. But in any case, the instruction says to \"filter the unrelated informations\" and structure the problem with assumptions. So perhaps in the current problem, we need to extract the key assumptions from the original question.\n\nThe original question is part (a): Prove that any simple module is isomorphic to R/M where M is a maximal ideal.\n\nThe user's confusions are about R/M being a left R-module vs over itself, and about ideals in modules. But the problem itself, as per the exercise, is to prove the isomorphism. The necessary assumptions would be:\n\n- The module is simple (non-zero, no proper submodules).\n- M is a maximal ideal of R.\n- R is a ring with identity (implicitly assumed in most module definitions).\n- The quotient R/M is a left R-module.\n\nBut since the problem is to show that any simple module is isomorphic to such a quotient, the key assumptions are the definition of a simple module and that M is a maximal ideal. However, in standard module theory, simple modules are cyclic, generated by any non-zero element, and for a ring R, the simple modules are isomorphic to R/M where M is a maximal left ideal. Therefore, the problem as stated might have a mistake, using \"ideal\" instead of \"left ideal\", but since the user is quoting Artin's book, perhaps in Artin's context, rings are commutative, so maximal ideals are two-sided and R/M is a field, hence a simple R-module.\n\nAssuming that, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nA module is simple if it is not the zero module and has no proper submodules,\nM is a maximal ideal of R,\nR is a commutative ring with identity,\nR/M is considered as an R-module with scalar multiplication induced by the quotient.\n\nProblem:\nProve that any simple module is isomorphic to R/M where M is a maximal ideal.\n\nBut wait, the problem doesn't specify R is commutative. However, if R is not commutative, then as mentioned earlier, R/M for a maximal ideal M might not be simple. Therefore, perhaps the key assumption is that R is commutative. But the original problem doesn't state this. This is a bit of a problem. However, since the user is working from Artin's book, which does cover non-commutative rings, but perhaps in this exercise, the context is commutative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is correct as stated, and the key is that in any ring, a maximal ideal M (two-sided) would make R/M a simple ring, but not necessarily a simple module. However, if we consider R/M as an R-module, then it's simple if M is a maximal left submodule (i.e., maximal left ideal). Therefore, there's a conflict here.\n\nGiven that the user's main confusion is about the structure of R/M as a module and the role of ideals, but the task is to structure the problem as per the original exercise, which is part (a), the formatted problem should reflect the exercise as stated, with assumptions derived from the problem's statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"A module is called simple if it is not the zero module and if it has no proper submodule. (a) Prove that any simple module is isomorphic to R/M, where M is a maximal ideal.\"\n\nThus, the assumptions would be:\n\n- A module is simple if it is not the zero module and has no proper submodules.\n- M is a maximal ideal of R.\n- R is a ring.\n- The quotient R/M is a left R-module.\n\nProblem: Prove that any simple module is isomorphic to R/M where M is a maximal ideal.\n\nHowever, the user's confusion is about whether R/M is a left R-module or over itself, which touches on the module structure. The problem likely assumes that R/M is considered as a left R-module via the natural action. Therefore, the assumptions are as above.\n\nBut to match the example's format, where each assumption is a single property applied to one object:\n\nAssumption:\nA module is simple if it is not the zero module,\nA simple module has no proper submodules,\nM is a maximal ideal of R,\nR is a ring,\nThe quotient R/M is a left R-module.\n\nProblem:\nProve that any simple module is isomorphic to R/M where M is a maximal ideal.\n\nAlternatively, breaking down the definition of a simple module into two separate assumptions (non-zero and no proper submodules). The ring R is an assumption, and M being a maximal ideal is another. The quotient R/M being a left module is perhaps implicit, but if needed, it could be listed.\n\nHowever, since the problem is about modules over R, the fact that R is a ring is already given. The key assumptions are the definition of a simple module and that M is a maximal ideal. The structure of R/M as a left R-module is part of the problem's context.\n\nIn the example given, the assumptions were about the variable n. Here, the assumptions are about the objects involved (module, ideal, ring). So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe module is simple (i.e., non-zero and no proper submodules),\nM is a maximal ideal of R,\nR is a ring.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the simple module is isomorphic to R/M.\n\nBut the problem states \"any simple module\", so it's more general. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nA module is simple if it is not the zero module,\nA simple module has no proper submodules,\nM is a maximal ideal of R,\nR is a ring.\n\nProblem:\nProve that any simple module is isomorphic to R/M where M is a maximal ideal.\n\nI think that's the correct structure. Each assumption is a single property: non-zero, no proper submodules, maximal ideal, and R being a ring. The problem is to show the isomorphism.",
