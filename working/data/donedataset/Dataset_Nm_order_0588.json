    "AcceptedAnswer": "Start with the definition. The Lebesgue integral of a simple function $s = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\alpha_j \\ \\chi_{A_j}$ is: $$\n\\int_E s \\,d\\mu = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\alpha_i \\ \\mu(E \\cap A_j)\n$$ If $\\mu(E) = 0$, then $\\mu(E \\cap A_j) = 0$ for all $j$. Thus $\\int_E s \\,d\\mu = 0$. The Lebesgue integral of a nonnegative function $f$ is the supremum of integrals of all simple functions $s$ such that $0 \\le s \\le f$. Since all of these integrals are $0$, the supremum is $0$ too. Since every real function $f$ can be written as $f = f^+ - f^-$ where $f^+$ and $f^-$ are both nonnegative, we have $\\int_E f \\, d\\mu = 0$ too. The general result follows from the fact that every complex function $f$ can be written as $f = u + i v$ where $u$ and $v$ are real.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. The problem statement then follows.\n\nLooking at the example, the original problem was about proving a number is divisible by 91, and the formatted version listed two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Then the problem statement was restated.\n\nNow, the current problem from Math Stack Exchange is titled \"Integral over null set is zero\" and the question is asking for a rigorous proof why the Lebesgue integral of any function over a null set is zero. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The key elements here are the Lebesgue integral, a function, and a null set. The problem is about integrating any function over a null set and showing the result is zero. \n\nAssumptions would be the conditions given or implied in the problem. The problem states \"any function\" but in Lebesgue integration, the function needs to be integrable. Wait, but the question says \"any function\", but maybe in the context of Lebesgue integration, we have to assume the function is integrable. However, the user might not have mentioned that. Wait, the original question just says \"any function over a null set\". But in Lebesgue theory, if the set is a null set, the integral over it is zero regardless of the function, as long as the function is measurable, perhaps. Wait, but maybe the function needs to be integrable over the entire space, or at least measurable. Let me recall: In Lebesgue integration, if you have a measurable function and integrate over a null set, the integral is zero. So the assumptions would be that the set is a null set (measure zero), and the function is measurable. But the original question didn't specify measurable function, but in the context of Lebesgue integral, functions are assumed measurable. However, the user's question is a bit elementary, so maybe the key assumptions are that the set is a null set (i.e., has measure zero) and the function is Lebesgue integrable. Wait, but actually, even if the function isn't integrable over the entire space, integrating over a null set would still be zero as long as the function is measurable. Because the integral over a null set is always zero for measurable functions, regardless of their integrability over the whole space. So perhaps the key assumptions here are:\n\n1. The set E is a null set (i.e., has Lebesgue measure zero).\n2. The function f is Lebesgue measurable.\n\nBut the original question says \"any function\". However, in Lebesgue integration, we typically deal with measurable functions. So maybe the problem implicitly assumes that the function is measurable. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- E is a null set.\n- f is a measurable function.\n\nBut the original problem states \"any function\", which might include non-measurable functions. However, in the context of Lebesgue integral, non-measurable functions aren't generally considered because their integrals aren't defined. So perhaps the correct assumptions are that E is a null set and f is measurable. However, the user's original question doesn't mention measurability, so maybe that's an implicit assumption in the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is stated in a context where all functions are measurable, which is standard in Lebesgue theory. So to structure the problem properly, the assumptions should include that E is a null set and f is measurable. But the problem says \"any function\", so perhaps the user is missing that implicit condition, but in the formatted problem, we need to list the necessary assumptions. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nE is a Lebesgue measurable set with measure zero,\nf is a Lebesgue measurable function.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that the integral of f over E is zero.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem as stated by the user doesn't mention that E is measurable or that f is measurable. The user's question is: \"why the Lebesgue integral of any function over a null set is zero.\" So perhaps in the problem statement, the key assumptions are that E is a null set (i.e., measurable with measure zero), and f is any function (but in the context of Lebesgue integral, f has to be measurable). However, the user might not be aware of the measurability requirement. So maybe the correct way to structure this is:\n\nAssumption:\nE is a null set (i.e., a set of Lebesgue measure zero),\nf is a function for which the Lebesgue integral over E is defined.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the Lebesgue integral of f over E is zero.\n\nAlternatively, if we take \"any function\" literally, but in Lebesgue terms, only measurable functions can be integrated. So maybe the problem implicitly assumes f is measurable. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nE is a null set,\nf is a Lebesgue measurable function.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ∫_E f dμ = 0.\n\nBut the user's question is phrased as \"any function\", which might lead to confusion. However, in the context of Lebesgue integral, the function must be measurable. So the correct assumptions are E is a null set and f is measurable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is more basic, and in the definition of Lebesgue integral, the integral over a null set is zero by definition. Wait, no. The integral is defined through simple functions, etc. Let me recall: The Lebesgue integral of a function over a set of measure zero is zero, regardless of the function's values there. Because the integral is defined by partitioning the range, but since the set has measure zero, the simple functions' integrals over that set would sum to zero. So even if f is not measurable, but if E is a null set, then the integral over E is zero? Wait, no. If the function is not measurable, then the integral isn't defined. So in order for the integral to exist, f must be measurable. So the correct assumptions are that E is a null set and f is measurable. Then the integral over E is zero.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nE is a Lebesgue measurable set with measure zero,\nf is a Lebesgue measurable function.\nProblem:\nProve that the Lebesgue integral of f over E is zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem doesn't specify that E is measurable, but a null set in Lebesgue measure is by definition measurable with measure zero. So perhaps the first assumption is just that E is a null set (which implies it's measurable and has measure zero). The second assumption is f is measurable.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should list these two assumptions and the problem as stated.",
