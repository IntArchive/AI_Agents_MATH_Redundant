    "Content": "Since $T_p G$ is isomorphic to $T_e G$ for all $p\\in G$, it makes sense that each vector in $T_p G$ can be identified with a vector in $T_e G$. Hence, to make the map from $TG$ one to one, we must identify each vector in $T_e G$ with a point in $G$, but I'm having trouble saying this precisely. Thanks so much!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I assume you mean to prove that $T_e G\\times G$ and $TG$ are isomorphic as bundles over $G$. As Jason DeVito points out you have the right idea--you just use the translation maps to slide the local triviality at $e$ around the entire group so that it is globally trivial. So I'm guessing you are having difficulty just getting the details nailed out. Define $\\Phi:G\\times T_e G\\to TG$ by $\\Phi(g,X)=(L_g)_\\ast(X)$. Clearly $\\Phi$ respects fibers and since $(L_g)_\\ast$ is a linear isomorphism (since $L_g$ is a diffeomorphism) it follows that $\\Phi$ is bijective. Let us now prove that $\\Phi$ is smooth. We shall see that everything shall be almost tautological once we choose charts correctly. Of course, the choosing of the charts is going to be slightly messy, but not too bad. Choose any $(g,X)\\in G\\times T_e G$. Choose then a centered chart $(U,\\varphi)$ of $G$ at $e$ and note that this naturally gives us a chart $(V,\\psi)$ at $g$ with $V=L_g(U)$ and $\\psi=\\varphi\\circ L_{g^{-1}}$. Now, the combination of these charts gives us a chart $(V\\times T_e G,\\phi)$ at $(g,X)$ defined by $$\\phi\\left(h,\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\alpha_i \\left.\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}\\right|_e\\right)=(\\psi(g),\\alpha_1,\\cdots,\\alpha_n)$$ Where, as usual, $\\displaystyle \\left.\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}\\right|_e$ is the pushforward of $\\displaystyle \\left.\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}\\right|_0\\in T_0\\mathbb{R}^n$ through $\\varphi^{-1}$. Recall that the choice of chart $(V,\\psi)$ at $g$ gives us a $(\\pi^{-1}(V),\\tau)$ (where $\\pi:TG\\to G$ is the canonical projection) given on the fiber $T_h G$ by $$\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\alpha_i\\left.\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}\\right|_h\\ \\longmapsto\\  (\\psi(h),\\alpha_1,\\cdots,\\alpha_n)$$ where, as above, $\\displaystyle \\left.\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}\\right|_h$ is the pushforward of $\\displaystyle \\left.\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}\\right|_{\\psi(h)}\\in T_{\\psi(h)}\\mathbb{R}^n$. So, now we want to show that $\\tau\\circ\\Phi\\circ\\phi^{-1}$ is smooth. That said, $$\\begin{aligned}\\tau\\left(\\Phi\\left(\\phi^{-1}\\left(\\psi(h),\\alpha_1,\\cdots,\\alpha_n\\right)\\right)\\right) &= \\tau\\left(\\Phi\\left(h,\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\alpha_i\\left.\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}\\right|_e\\right)\\right)\\\\ &=\\tau\\left((L_h)_\\ast\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\alpha_i\\left.\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}\\right|_e\\right)\\right)\\\\ &= \\tau\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\alpha_i (L_h)_\\ast\\left(\\left.\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}\\right|_e\\right)\\right)\\\\ &= \\tau\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\alpha_i \\left.\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}\\right|_h\\right)\\\\ &= (\\psi(h),\\alpha_1,\\cdots,\\alpha_n)\\end{aligned}$$ where we have used the fact that, as defined, $\\displaystyle (L_h)_\\ast\\left(\\left.\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}\\right|_e\\right)=\\left.\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}\\right|_h$ (check this!). Thus, it's pretty obvious that $\\tau\\circ\\Phi\\circ\\phi^{-1}$ is smooth--it's the identity map! Since $\\Phi$ is a bijective bundle map it follows from basic topology that $\\Phi$ is a bundle isomorphism Of course, if you are privy to a little more bundle theory than the definitions there is a simpler way to do all of the above. Namely, recall that a global frame for a vector bundle $\\pi:B\\to M^n$ is a set global sections $\\sigma_i:M\\to B$, where $i=1,\\cdots,n$, such that for each $x\\in M$ we have that $\\{\\sigma_i(x)\\}$ is a basis for $B_x$. A common fact then is that a vector bundle is trivial if and only if it admits a global frame (see here if this is unknown to you). So, the above ideal of sliding the local trivilizations around the entirety of $G$ becomes even more concrete since we can use local frames (local trivilizations) to construct global ones). Namely, let us a choose a chart $(U,\\varphi)$ at $e\\in G$ and note that we have a natural map $\\sigma:U\\to TG$ defined by taking a poing $h\\in U$ to the basis $\\displaystyle \\left\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}\\mid_h\\right\\}$ (as defined above). Let us then extend $\\sigma$ to a global section $\\sigma:G\\to TG$ by defining $\\sigma$ on $L_g(U)$ for every $g\\in G$ to send $x$ to $(L_g)_\\ast(\\sigma(g^{-1}x))$. It's not hard to see that this definition is well-defined, and moreover that $\\sigma$ is then a global frame for $TG\\to G$. Thus, $TG$ is trivial. You'll note that this is practically the same proof as above, just a lot of work hidden in the theorem \"trivial bundles are exactly those with global frames\". One last thing I can't help to point out. This theorem (which really was not too hard to prove!) says that every Lie group is parallelizable (has a trivial tangent bundle). This precludes a lot of spaces from possessing a Lie group structure at all! For example, it is the statement of the famous Hairy Ball Theorem that every even dimensional sphere is not parallelizable and thus can't (for any attempted definition of an operation!) be given the structure of a Lie Group. That is pretty cool. By the way, the only spheres which are Lie groups are $S^0$, $S^1$, and $S^3$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So the question is about showing that the tangent bundle TG of a Lie group G is diffeomorphic to the product G times the tangent space at the identity, T_eG. \n\nFirst, I remember that a Lie group is a smooth manifold with a group structure where the group operations are smooth. That means multiplication and inversion are smooth maps. Now, the tangent bundle TG is the collection of all tangent vectors at all points of G. So for each point p in G, we have T_pG, the tangent space at p.\n\nThe user mentioned that T_pG is isomorphic to T_eG for all p in G. That makes sense because in a Lie group, the group operation can be used to translate vectors from the identity to any other point. Specifically, left translation by p, which is the map L_p: G → G defined by L_p(q) = pq. Since L_p is a diffeomorphism (because the group operations are smooth), its derivative dL_p at the identity e is a vector space isomorphism from T_eG to T_pG. So each tangent space T_pG can be identified with T_eG via dL_p.\n\nNow, the tangent bundle TG is the union of all T_pG for p in G. The idea is that since each T_pG is isomorphic to T_eG, we can parameterize TG by pairs (p, v) where p is in G and v is in T_eG. But we need to make sure this identification is smooth, right? Because we need a diffeomorphism, not just a bijection.\n\nSo to construct the diffeomorphism, maybe we can use the map that takes a tangent vector X_p in T_pG and sends it to (p, dL_{p^{-1}}(X_p)). Here, dL_{p^{-1}} is the derivative of the inverse left translation, which would map X_p back to T_eG. Then the inverse map would take (p, v) and map it to dL_p(v), which is in T_pG. \n\nWait, let me check that. If we have a vector v in T_eG, then applying dL_p to v gives a vector in T_pG. So the inverse of the previous map. So the diffeomorphism would be Φ: TG → G×T_eG defined by Φ(X_p) = (p, dL_{p^{-1}}(X_p)), and the inverse would be Ψ(p, v) = dL_p(v). \n\nWe need to verify that Φ is smooth. Since G is a Lie group, the operations are smooth, so the map p ↦ L_p is smooth, and hence the derivative dL_p is smooth in p. Similarly, dL_{p^{-1}} would also be smooth because inversion in G is smooth. Therefore, the map Φ should be smooth. Similarly, Ψ is smooth because it's built from the smooth left translation and the smooth inclusion of v into the tangent space.\n\nAnother point to consider is the structure of TG as a vector bundle. The trivialization here is global, which is possible because the tangent bundle of a Lie group is trivializable via left translations. So this diffeomorphism is actually a vector bundle isomorphism, preserving the linear structure on each fiber.\n\nBut the problem just asks for a diffeomorphism, not necessarily a vector bundle isomorphism. However, the construction using left translations does preserve the structure, so it's a stronger result. \n\nI should also make sure there are no mistakes in the reasoning. Let me think again: each tangent space is identified with T_eG via the derivative of left translation. The map Φ takes a tangent vector at p and translates it back to e using the inverse left translation. This gives a consistent way to associate each tangent vector with a point in G and a vector in T_eG. The smoothness follows from the smoothness of group operations. \n\nI think that covers it. So the key assumptions are that G is a Lie group, which gives the smooth structure and the existence of left translations, and the properties of their derivatives providing isomorphisms between tangent spaces. The problem then is to construct the diffeomorphism explicitly using these translations and verify its smoothness.",
