    "Content": "Why isn't an infinite direct product of copies of $\\Bbb Z$ a free module? Actually I was asked to show that it's not projective, but as $\\Bbb{Z}$ is a PID, so it suffices to show it's not free. I am stuck here. I saw some questions in SE, but there is no satisfactory answer at all.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This failure of freeness is a non-trivial result.  One way to prove it is to begin with a lemma: If $F$ is a free abelian group and $C$ is a countable subgroup, then the quotient $F/C$  is the direct sum of a countable group and a free group.  (I'm omitting \"abelian\" because I'm lazy and all groups here will be abelian.)  [Proof of lemma: Fix a basis $B$ for $F$, let $B_0$ be the countable subset consisting of the basis elements that occur when you expand elements of $C$ in terms of your basis $B$.  Then $F$ is the direct sum of $F_0$ freely generated by $B_0$ and $F_1$ freely generated by $B-B_0$.  As $C\\subseteq F_0$, it follows that $F/C$ is the direct sum of the countable group $F_0/C$ and the free group $F_1$.] As a corollary, under the hypotheses of the lemma, any divisible subgroup of $F/C$ must be included in the countable summand and must therefore be countable. Now suppose the direct product $P$ of countably infinitely many copies of $\\mathbb Z$ were free.  The elements of $P$ are the all of the infinite sequences of integers.  Let $C$ be the subgroup of $P$ consisting of those sequences that have non-zero entries in only finitely many positions.  Then $C$ is countable, so the divisible part of $P/C$ would have to be countable.  But this divisible part contains the cosets (in $P/C$) of all the sequences (in $P$) of the form $n\\mapsto n!\\cdot a_n$ for arbitrary sequences of integers $(a_n)$.  So the divisible part of $P/C$ has the cardinality of the continuum. This contradiction shows that $P$ is not free. If your question was not only about $P$ but also about products of uncountably many copies of $\\mathbb Z$, notice that such a product contains a copy of $P$, so you're done if you know that subgroups of free (abelian) groups are free.  If you don't know that, just re-run the argument in the preceding paragraph within a copy of $P$ inside your bigger product. By the way, a theorem of Specker shows that $P$ is not only not free but very far from free.  Since $P$ has cardinality $2^{\\aleph_0}$, if it were free any basis for it would also have cardinality $2^{\\aleph_0}$, so there would be $2^{2^{\\aleph_0}}$ homomorphisms from $P$ to $\\mathbb Z$ (because you could choose the images of the $2^{\\aleph_0}$ basis elements arbitrarily).  Specker showed that there are only countably many homomorphisms $P\\to\\mathbb Z$, namely the $\\mathbb Z$-linear combinations of the projections.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants to know why an infinite direct product of copies of ℤ isn't a free module. They mentioned that they were asked to show it's not projective, but since ℤ is a PID, projective modules are free, so it's enough to show the product isn't free. They’re stuck and haven’t found satisfactory answers on SE.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the definitions. A free module over ℤ (which is a PID) is a module that has a basis—a set of elements that are linearly independent and span the module. For example, ℤ^n is free with the standard basis. Now, the question is about an infinite direct product, which is different from a direct sum. The direct product allows for tuples with infinitely many non-zero components, whereas the direct sum requires that only finitely many components are non-zero. So, the key here is that the module in question is the product, not the sum.\n\nI remember that in the case of vector spaces, infinite-dimensional spaces still have bases (thanks to the axiom of choice), but modules over ℤ (abelian groups) can behave differently. For instance, subgroups of free abelian groups are free, but this doesn't necessarily extend to infinite products.\n\nOne possible approach is to use a theorem or property specific to free abelian groups. I recall that a free abelian group is isomorphic to a direct sum of copies of ℤ. But here we have a direct product. If the product were free, it would have to be isomorphic to a direct sum, but these are different. However, maybe there's a more concrete way to see this.\n\nAnother angle is to consider the cardinality of the basis. If the product were free, it would have a basis. Let’s suppose, for contradiction, that the product has a basis. Then every element can be uniquely expressed as a finite linear combination of basis elements with integer coefficients. But in the direct product, elements can have infinitely many non-zero entries. How would that interact with the basis?\n\nWait, maybe there's a theorem called the Specker phenomenon. Specker proved that the infinite product of ℤ (known as the Baer-Specker group) is not free, even though the direct sum is. The proof involves showing that certain homomorphisms can't exist or using cardinality arguments about the dual group. Alternatively, maybe using the fact that in a free abelian group, every element can be expressed uniquely as a finite combination, but in the product, there are elements with infinite support, leading to contradictions about linear independence.\n\nAlternatively, think about homological algebra. For a module to be projective, it has to be a direct summand of a free module. If the product is not free, then it can't be projective. But since the user is focusing on showing it's not free, we can perhaps use a counting argument. Suppose the product is free with basis B. The cardinality of B would have to be uncountable since the product has uncountable cardinality (as each element is a sequence of integers). However, the dual group (homomorphisms to ℤ) of the product is the direct sum, which is countable, leading to a contradiction because the dual of a free abelian group with uncountable basis would have a dual of much larger cardinality.\n\nWait, let me verify that. If the product is ∏_{i∈ℕ} ℤ, then its dual group Hom(∏ℤ, ℤ) is isomorphic to ⊕Hom(ℤ, ℤ) = ⊕ℤ, which is countable. But if ∏ℤ were free with basis B, then Hom(∏ℤ, ℤ) would be isomorphic to the product of Hom(ℤ, ℤ)^B, which is the product of ℤ^B, which has cardinality at least 2^|B|. If B is uncountable, then 2^|B| is strictly larger than |⊕ℤ|, which is countable. Hence, contradiction. Therefore, ∏ℤ cannot be free.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to use the fact that subgroups of free abelian groups are free. But ∏ℤ is not a subgroup of a free abelian group? Wait, no. If ∏ℤ were free, then it would itself be a free group, but perhaps it contains a subgroup that isn't free. But I think the dual argument is more straightforward.\n\nSo, putting this together, the key assumptions are that we're working over ℤ (a PID), the module in question is the infinite direct product (not sum), and properties of dual groups leading to a contradiction about the cardinality of the basis. Therefore, the problem reduces to showing that the dual of the product is too small if the product were free, hence it can't be free.",
