    "Content": "I need to prove that the square of the Euclidean norm is convex, so: $||\\theta x+(1-\\theta)y||^2\\leq\\theta||x||^2+(1-\\theta)||y||^2$. Can I use the triangular inequality (if yes, how?) or should I use something else?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Notice that $f(x)=x^2$ is convex ($2=f''(x)>0$.) Thus it is convex, which means that it satisfies $f\\big(\\theta\\|x\\|+(1-\\theta)\\|y\\|\\big)\\leq \\theta f(\\|x\\|)+(1-\\theta)f(\\|y\\|)$\nfor $\\theta\\in [0, 1]$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to prove that the squared Euclidean norm is convex. The inequality given is ||θx + (1−θ)y||² ≤ θ||x||² + (1−θ)||y||², where θ is between 0 and 1. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what convexity means. A function f is convex if for any two points x and y in its domain and any θ ∈ [0,1], f(θx + (1−θ)y) ≤ θf(x) + (1−θ)f(y). So in this case, the function f is the squared Euclidean norm, which is f(z) = ||z||².\n\nThe user mentioned possibly using the triangle inequality. The triangle inequality states that ||a + b|| ≤ ||a|| + ||b||, but I'm not sure how that directly applies here. Maybe expanding the left-hand side of the inequality would help. Let's try that.\n\nExpanding the left side: ||θx + (1−θ)y||². The squared norm of a vector is equal to the dot product of the vector with itself. So this becomes (θx + (1−θ)y) · (θx + (1−θ)y). Let's expand that:\n\n= θ²x·x + 2θ(1−θ)x·y + (1−θ)²y·y\n\nNow, the right side of the inequality is θ||x||² + (1−θ)||y||², which is θx·x + (1−θ)y·y.\n\nSo we need to show that θ²||x||² + 2θ(1−θ)x·y + (1−θ)²||y||² ≤ θ||x||² + (1−θ)||y||².\n\nSubtracting the left side from the right side, we get:\n\nθ||x||² + (1−θ)||y||² - [θ²||x||² + 2θ(1−θ)x·y + (1−θ)²||y||²]\n\n= θ(1 - θ)||x||² + (1−θ)(1 - (1−θ))||y||² - 2θ(1−θ)x·y\n\n= θ(1−θ)||x||² + θ(1−θ)||y||² - 2θ(1−θ)x·y\n\nFactor out θ(1−θ):\n\n= θ(1−θ)[ ||x||² + ||y||² - 2x·y ]\n\nNotice that ||x||² + ||y||² - 2x·y is equal to ||x - y||² (since expanding (x - y)·(x - y) gives ||x||² - 2x·y + ||y||²). Therefore, the expression becomes θ(1−θ)||x - y||².\n\nSince θ is between 0 and 1, θ(1−θ) is non-negative, and the squared norm is always non-negative. Therefore, θ(1−θ)||x - y||² ≥ 0. This means that the right side minus the left side is non-negative, hence proving the inequality. Therefore, the squared Euclidean norm is convex.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to note that the squared norm is a convex function because its Hessian matrix is positive semi-definite. The Hessian of f(z) = ||z||² is 2I, which is positive definite, hence f is convex. But maybe the user is looking for a more elementary proof without using calculus.\n\nSo the key steps are expanding the left-hand side, rearranging terms, and recognizing the resulting expression as a non-negative quantity. This confirms the convexity.",
