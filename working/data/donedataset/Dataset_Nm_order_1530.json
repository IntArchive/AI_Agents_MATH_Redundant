    "Content": "My final for my introductory analysis course is tomorrow and my teacher gave us a list of possible theorems to prove. If anyone could please show me a proof for The Intermediate Value Theorem that is short and easy to follow, so even if I still cannot understand it I can at least memorize it. Also, I have looked through numerous texts and the internet, but they all seem to confuse me. I know that itis an insult to all you math experts to memorize proofs, but I am desperate at this point. Thank you",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The indermediate value theorem says: Let $f:[a,b]\\to \\mathbb{R}$ be continuous and $f(a)<0$ and $f(b)>0$, then there exists a \n  $\\xi \\in (a,b)$ such that $f(\\xi)=0$. You can prove it by using nested intervals: You look at $f(\\frac{a+b}{2})$, when it is bigger than null you look at $f$ on the interval\n$[a,\\frac{a+b}{2}]$, if it is smaller than 0 we look at $[\\frac{a+b}{2},b]$, when it is $0$ we are done. Lets denote the left endpoints with $a_n$ and the right endpoints with $b_n$. As the diameter of our nested intervals is $(b-a)\\cdot 2^{-n}$ which clearly converges to zero we have \n$$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} a_n =\\lim_{n\\to \\infty} b_n=\\xi$$\nAs $f$ is continuous we get \n$$\\lim_{n\\to \\infty} f(a_n)=\\lim_{n\\to \\infty} f(b_n)=f(\\xi)$$\nOn the other hand we know \n$$f(a_n) < 0 \\quad \\forall n$$\nand $$ f(b_n)>0 \\quad \\forall n $$\nHence we know \n$$\\lim_{n\\to \\infty} f(a_n)\\leq 0$$\nand $$\\lim_{n\\to \\infty} f(b_n)\\geq 0$$\nHence\n$$0\\leq f(\\xi) \\leq 0$$ \nHence $f(\\xi)=0$ You use that when $C_i$ is closed, bounded  and non empty for all $i$ and $C_{i+1} \\subset C_i$ for all $i$ then \n$$\\bigcap_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}} C_i \\neq \\varnothing$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure a question from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The example provided shows that the original problem might have extra information, and the task is to filter out the unrelated parts and list assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then, restate the problem concisely.\n\nLooking at the example given, the original problem mentioned that the number A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. However, in the formatted problem, the assumption includes that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems a bit confusing. In the original problem, the user was talking about \"every integer n\", but the formatted assumption adds that n is divisible by 7. Is that correct? Hmm, maybe there was a mistake in the example. But perhaps the example was intended to show how to extract assumptions, even if the original problem didn't state them explicitly. Wait, no. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" which actually changes the original problem's condition. That seems incorrect. Maybe the example is wrong, but the user provided it as an example of how to structure, so I should follow that method regardless.\n\nNow, moving to the current problem. The user provided a question from Math Stack Exchange titled \"Is there a short proof for the Intermediate Value Theorem\". The question is from a student preparing for an exam, asking for a short and easy-to-follow proof of the IVT, possibly to memorize because they're desperate.\n\nFirst, I need to structure this into the Assumption and Problem sections. The assumptions should list all the conditions required for the IVT. The problem is to prove the Intermediate Value Theorem.\n\nBut wait, the Intermediate Value Theorem has specific assumptions. Let me recall. The IVT states that if a function f is continuous on [a, b], and c is a value between f(a) and f(b), then there exists some c in [a, b] such that f(c) equals that value. So the assumptions would be:\n\n1. f is a function defined on the interval [a, b].\n2. f is continuous on [a, b].\n3. c is a real number such that c is between f(a) and f(b).\n\nBut in the original question, the user is asking for a proof of the IVT, so the problem is to prove that under these conditions, there exists some x in [a, b] such that f(x) = c.\n\nBut the original question doesn't state the theorem; it just asks for a proof. So I need to extract the assumptions from the standard IVT statement, even if the original question doesn't list them. Because the user's task is to filter out unrelated information and structure the problem with assumptions.\n\nThe original question mentions that the student is in an introductory analysis course, and the teacher gave possible theorems to prove. The student is desperate and wants a short proof to memorize. But the problem is to prove the Intermediate Value Theorem. So the assumptions are the standard ones for IVT.\n\nTherefore, structuring this:\n\nAssumptions:\n- f is a real-valued function defined on the interval [a, b].\n- f is continuous on [a, b].\n- c is a real number between f(a) and f(b).\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a point x in [a, b] such that f(x) = c.\n\nWait, but the problem is the IVT. The original question doesn't state the theorem's content, just asks for a proof. So to structure the problem properly, we need to present the theorem's statement as the problem to prove, along with its assumptions.\n\nSo in the formatted problem, the Assumptions section lists the conditions of the theorem, and the Problem is to prove the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$f$ is a real-valued function defined on the interval $[a, b]$,\n$f$ is continuous on $[a, b]$,\n$c$ is a real number between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$.\nProblem: \nProve that there exists a point $x$ in $[a, b]$ such that $f(x) = c$.\n###",
