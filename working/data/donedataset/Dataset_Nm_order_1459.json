    "AcceptedAnswer": "I'm not sure that the cyclicity of the unit group of a finite field is being used here.  (Not that I have any problem using it: see e.g. Section 2 of these notes for a proof.) Let $K/\\mathbb{F}_q$ be a field extension of degree $n$ , so $\\# K = q^n$ .  Let $\\sigma: K \\rightarrow K$ be $x \\mapsto x^q$ . Recall: (Lagrange's Little Theorem): Let $G$ be a finite abelian group of order $n$ and $g \\in G$ .  Then the order of $g$ divides $n$ . The point is that LLT is a special case of Lagrange's Theorem which can be proved by the same argument which proves Fermat's Little Theorem -- i.e., the special case in which $G = \\mathbb{F}_p^{\\times}$ .  So one need not talk about cosets and such... Let $x \\in \\mathbb{F}_q$ .  I claim that $x^q = x$ .  This is clear if $x = 0$ , and otherwise apply LLT to $x \\in \\mathbb{F}_q^{\\times}$ to get $x^{q-1} = 1$ , which implies $x^q = x$ . Therefore $\\sigma$ is an automorphism of $K/\\mathbb{F}_q$ .  As for its order, suppose $\\sigma^i$ is equal to the identity: that is, for all $x \\in K$ , $x^{q^i} = x$ .  We have $P_i(t) = t^{q^i} - t \\in K[t]$ is a polynomial of degree $q^i$ over the field $K$ , so by the Root-Factor Theorem (a consequence of the division algorithm for polynomials), $P_i(t)$ has at most $q^i$ roots.  It follows that the order of $\\sigma$ is equal to $n = \\log_q(\\# K)$ .  Thus the cyclic group generated by $\\sigma$ is a degree $n$ subgroup of $\\operatorname{Aut}(K/\\mathbb{F}_q)$ .  But by basic Galois theory, for an extension $K/F$ of degree $n$ , we have $\\# \\operatorname{Aut}(K/F) \\leq n$ , with equality holding if and only if $K/F$ is Galois.  Therefore $K/\\mathbb{F}_q$ is a cyclic Galois extension. If we like, we can now establish that there is a unique cyclic extension of degree $n$ for any $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$ : we can take\nthe splitting field of $t^{q^n} - t$ , and splitting fields exist and are unique up to (nonunique) isomorphism over the ground field. It seems to me that I have not used the cyclicity of $\\mathbb{F}_q^{\\times}$ anywhere...",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The question is asking whether all extensions of finite fields are cyclic. The user mentioned their book states this but doesn't provide a proof, and they're looking for an explanation.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic facts about finite fields. Finite fields, also known as Galois fields, have order p^n where p is a prime and n is a positive integer. Every finite field has a multiplicative group that's cyclic. That's a key property. So, for a field GF(p^n), the multiplicative group GF(p^n)* is cyclic of order p^n - 1.\n\nNow, when considering field extensions, specifically finite extensions of finite fields, we're talking about extensions like GF(p^m) over GF(p^n) where n divides m. The question is about the Galois group of such extensions. Since finite fields are perfect, every extension is Galois. So the extension GF(p^m)/GF(p^n) is Galois, and we need to determine the structure of its Galois group.\n\nI remember that the Galois group of a finite extension of finite fields is cyclic. Let me think why. The Galois group consists of field automorphisms that fix the base field. For GF(p^m) over GF(p^n), the base field is GF(p^n). The automorphisms here are generated by the Frobenius automorphism, which is σ: x → x^{p^n}. Applying this automorphism repeatedly should generate all the automorphisms in the Galois group. Since the degree of the extension is [GF(p^m) : GF(p^n)] = m/n, the Galois group should have order m/n. \n\nLet me check if the Frobenius map indeed generates the entire Galois group. The Frobenius automorphism σ(x) = x^{p^n} fixes GF(p^n) because for any a in GF(p^n), a^{p^n} = a (since the multiplicative order is p^n - 1, and a^{p^n} = a). Applying σ m/n times gives x^{p^{n(m/n)}} = x^{p^m} = x, which is the identity on GF(p^m). Therefore, the Galois group is cyclic of order m/n, generated by the Frobenius automorphism.\n\nSo the key points are: finite fields have cyclic multiplicative groups, their extensions are Galois, and the Galois group is generated by the Frobenius automorphism, hence cyclic. Therefore, all extensions of finite fields are indeed cyclic, meaning their Galois groups are cyclic. This answers the user's question.",
