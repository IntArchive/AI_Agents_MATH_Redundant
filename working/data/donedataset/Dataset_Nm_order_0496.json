Observe that $F$ has $20$ poles inside $C$ , summing over residues at these points gives the red expression.

First, expand $\\coth \\pi x$ in power series of $e^{-\\pi x}$ , termwise integration yields $$\\int_0^\\infty  {{x^{s - 1}}\\left( {1 - \\coth \\pi x} \\right)dx}  =  - {2^{1 - s}}{\\pi ^{ - s}}\\Gamma (s)\\zeta (s) =  - \\sec \\frac{{\\pi s}}{2}\\zeta (1 - s) \\qquad \\Re(s)>1$$ where we used the functional equation of $\\zeta$ .

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given integral problem into the specified format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions. The original question mentions an integral from 0 to infinity involving terms with cos(πx²), sinh(πx), and 1/(πx). The goal is to prove the integral equals (1/√2)ζ(1/2). \n\nLooking at the integral, the integrand is [cos(πx²)/sinh(πx) - 1/(πx)] divided by sqrt(x). The assumptions here might relate to the convergence of the integral, the behavior of the functions involved, and any conditions needed for the integral to hold true. \n\nWait, the example given in the problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But here, the integral is over all positive real numbers, so maybe there are no explicit assumptions stated? The problem doesn't mention any specific conditions, but perhaps there are implicit ones. For example, the integrand must be defined for all x > 0. Let's check for x approaching 0 and infinity.\n\nNear x=0: sinh(πx) ≈ πx, so the term [cos(πx²)/sinh(πx) - 1/(πx)] becomes [1/(πx) - 1/(πx)] = 0, so the numerator approaches 0. Divided by sqrt(x), the integrand behaves like 0/sqrt(x) = 0, so no problem there. \n\nAs x approaches infinity: sinh(πx) grows exponentially, so cos(πx²)/sinh(πx) decays exponentially. The term 1/(πx) decays as 1/x. So the integrand should decay rapidly enough. Thus, the integral converges. But the problem statement doesn't specify any particular conditions, so maybe there are no additional assumptions needed beyond the integral being properly defined. \n\nWait, the original problem just states the integral equals the zeta value. So perhaps the only assumption is that the integral converges, but since the user is asking for a proof, maybe there are no explicit assumptions. However, in the example, they listed n is an integer and divisible by 7, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". Wait, in the example, the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the original problem said \"for every integer n\". Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem listed assumptions as n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example was a mistake? Because if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", then the assumption shouldn't be that n is divisible by 7. That might be an error in the example. But perhaps the user intended to show that even with such assumptions, they structure it. \n\nBut in our current problem, the original question doesn't state any conditions, so maybe the assumptions are implicit. However, the problem might require that the integral is convergent, so perhaps the integrand is well-behaved. But since the user didn't specify any, perhaps the assumptions section here is empty except for the structure of the problem itself. \n\nWait, looking at the example again, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem listed n is an integer and n divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Maybe the example was a different problem where the user made a mistake. Maybe I should focus on the current problem. \n\nThe problem here is to structure the integral problem. The user wants all assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. In this case, the integral is from 0 to infinity. The integrand is [cos(πx²)/sinh(πx) - 1/(πx)] / sqrt(x). The result is (1/√2)ζ(1/2). \n\nAre there any assumptions here? The problem states \"Prove that...\" so perhaps the only assumption is that the integral converges, but since the user is asking for a proof technique, maybe there are no explicit assumptions. However, sometimes in integrals, especially involving oscillatory functions like cosine, certain conditions are needed for convergence. But since the problem states it's numerically verified, we can assume the integral exists. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that x is a positive real variable, which is standard for integrals from 0 to infinity. But maybe that's too obvious. The example included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, which is similar. So here, perhaps the assumption is that x is a positive real number. But the variable of integration is x, so that's inherent to the integral. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no explicit assumptions needed beyond what's in the problem statement. The user might just need to restate the problem. But according to the example, even if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So following that pattern, perhaps here the assumption is that the integral is over x > 0. \n\nBut the problem is already stated as an integral from 0 to infinity, so maybe that's redundant. Alternatively, the integrand involves sinh(πx), which is defined for all real x, but the integral is from 0 to infinity. The term 1/sqrt(x) is defined for x > 0. \n\nWait, the example might have been structured incorrectly. For instance, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, which seems to add an extra condition not in the original problem. That might have been a mistake. Therefore, perhaps in the current problem, since the original problem doesn't state any conditions, the assumptions section is empty. But that can't be. The format requires assumptions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the integral is convergent, which might be an assumption. But in the example, the assumption was about n being integer and divisible by 7, which were conditions for the problem. Here, maybe the assumption is that the integral converges. But since the problem states it's numerically verified, maybe that's not necessary. \n\nHmm, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example, and the correct approach is to list all the conditions necessary for the problem to hold. For the integral problem, the integrand must be integrable over [0, ∞). Therefore, the assumptions would be that the integrand is integrable on (0, ∞). But that's part of the problem statement. Alternatively, if there's a restriction on parameters, but in this case, there are none. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has no explicit assumptions, so the assumptions section is empty. But the format requires an assumption section. Maybe in this case, since there are no explicit assumptions, we list the integral is convergent. But the problem already states that the result is numerically verified, implying convergence. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no assumptions, and the problem is as stated. But the example included assumptions even when the original problem didn't mention them. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which is an assumption. So in the formatted problem, they listed \"n is an integer\". Then they added \"n is divisible by 7\", which was not in the original problem. That seems like an error. Maybe the example was incorrect. \n\nGiven that confusion, perhaps for the current problem, the assumptions are only the ones explicitly stated in the problem. Since the problem is to prove the integral equals that value, and the integral is given as from 0 to infinity with the integrand as specified, perhaps there are no additional assumptions. However, to follow the example's structure, even if it's flawed, I need to list assumptions. \n\nWait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Maybe the example is not a good one. \n\nGiven that, perhaps the user expects me to list any necessary conditions for the problem to hold. For the integral, perhaps the only assumption is that the integral converges. So I can list:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral $$\\int_0^{\\infty } \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x}}\\left(\\frac{\\cos (\\pi  x^2)}{\\sinh (\\pi  x)}-\\frac{1}{\\pi x}\\right) \\, dx$$ converges.\n\nBut the problem states it's numerically verified, so maybe that's redundant. Alternatively, since the problem is to prove the equality, the assumptions might be the convergence. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem doesn't require any assumptions beyond the integral setup. In the example, even though the problem said \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\". So following that, perhaps here the assumption is that x is a positive real variable, but that's inherent in the integral bounds. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are no assumptions, but the format requires at least one. Given the example, maybe we should include the integral's convergence as an assumption. \n\nSo, I'll structure it as follows:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral $$\\int_0^{\\infty } \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x}}\\left(\\frac{\\cos(\\pi x^2)}{\\sinh (\\pi x)}-\\frac{1}{\\pi x}\\right) \\, dx$$ converges.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\int_0^{\\infty } \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x}}\\left(\\frac{\\cos(\\pi x^2)}{\\sinh (\\pi x)}-\\frac{1}{\\pi x}\\right) \\, dx = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\zeta\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right).$$\n\nBut wait, the original problem didn't mention convergence as an assumption, it's part of the problem. However, in the example, they listed \"n is an integer\" even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So following that pattern, perhaps here the assumption is that x is a positive real number, but that's already covered by the integral's limits. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no assumptions needed, but the format requires some. Maybe the example was incorrect. Given this confusion, perhaps the safest way is to follow the user's example, even if it's flawed. In their example, they took \"for every integer n\" and split it into \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, and added another assumption not present in the original problem. That seems like a mistake. Therefore, perhaps in the current problem, since there are no explicit conditions given, the assumptions section is empty. But the format requires an assumption section. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to extract implicit assumptions. For example, in the integral, the integrand must be defined for all x > 0. So the functions involved (cos, sinh) are defined there, and the denominator sinh(πx) is non-zero for x > 0, which is true because sinh(z) is zero only at z=0. So x > 0 ensures sinh(πx) ≠ 0. Therefore, maybe the assumption is that x is a positive real number, which is already part of the integral's domain. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might require techniques from complex analysis, but that's part of the solution, not assumptions. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, but following the example where the original problem's conditions were split into assumptions, here the integral is from 0 to infinity, so the assumption would be that x is a positive real number. But since the integral is from 0 to infinity, that's inherent. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are no assumptions, and the problem is as stated. However, the example included assumptions even when the original problem stated \"for every integer n\", so perhaps here, similarly, the assumption is that the integral is over x > 0. But how to phrase that? \n\nMaybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe variable x is a positive real number.\n\nBut that's already part of the integral's definition. \n\nAlternatively, since the problem involves an improper integral, maybe the assumptions are about the convergence at 0 and infinity. But the user is asking to prove the result, which implies convergence. \n\nGiven the example provided, which seems to have added an incorrect assumption, perhaps the user wants me to extract all conditions necessary for the problem to hold. In this case, the integral converges, and the functions are defined appropriately. \n\nBut since the problem is stated as an equality that's been numerically verified, the main task is to prove it. Therefore, perhaps there are no explicit assumptions beyond the integral setup. \n\nHowever, to adhere to the format, I need to list assumptions. Maybe the only assumption is that the integral converges. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral $$\\int_0^{\\infty } \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x}}\\left(\\frac{\\cos(\\pi x^2)}{\\sinh (\\pi x)}-\\frac{1}{\\pi x}\\right) \\, dx$$ converges.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the integral equals $$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\zeta\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right).$$\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's necessary. Alternatively, since the problem is to prove the equality, perhaps the assumptions are the conditions needed for the equality to hold. For example, if there's a restriction on parameters, but here there are none. \n\nIn the absence of clear assumptions, perhaps the problem should have no assumptions listed. But the format requires the assumption section. Therefore, maybe the correct answer is:\n\nAssumption:\nNone explicitly stated beyond the integral's definition.\n\nBut according to the example, even if the problem states \"for every integer n\", it's listed as an assumption. So following that, here the integral is defined over x > 0, so the assumption is x > 0. \n\nBut how to phrase that. Alternatively, the user wants the assumptions to be each on one line. For example:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is taken over the interval $(0, \\infty)$,\nThe integrand is defined as $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x}}\\left(\\frac{\\cos(\\pi x^2)}{\\sinh (\\pi x)}-\\frac{1}{\\pi x}\\right)$,\nThe Riemann zeta function $\\zeta(s)$ is defined at $s = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nBut that seems excessive. The example only listed assumptions related to the variables in the problem, not the functions involved. \n\nAlternatively, the key assumptions are:\n\n- The integral converges.\n- The functions involved (cos, sinh, etc.) are sufficiently smooth or meet conditions required for the techniques used (e.g., differentiation under the integral sign).\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify these, it's hard to say. \n\nGiven the example provided, which took a problem about integers and split it into \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" (even though the original problem didn't mention divisibility), perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Maybe the user wants to list all conditions necessary for the problem to hold, even if they are implicit. \n\nBut in this integral problem, the main challenge is to prove the equality. The assumptions needed would be the convergence of the integral and the validity of the steps in the proof (like swapping integrals and sums, etc.), but those are part of the proof technique, not assumptions. \n\nGiven the confusion, I'll proceed with the following assumptions based on the integral's definition:\n\nAssumption:\nThe variable x is a positive real number,\nThe integral converges.\n\nBut since x is the variable of integration, it's inherent. The example listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. Here, the equivalent would be x is a positive real number, but that's part of the integral's domain. \n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to prove the equality, maybe there are no explicit assumptions, and the formatted problem should list the problem as is. But the example shows that assumptions are extracted even from the problem's original statement. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll follow the example's structure where the original problem's conditions are listed as assumptions. Here, the integral is from 0 to infinity, so perhaps the assumption is that the integral is over x > 0. \n\nThus:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is over the interval $(0, \\infty)$,\nThe functions $\\cos(\\pi x^2)$, $\\sinh(\\pi x)$, and $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x}}$ are defined for $x > 0$.\n\nBut this seems too detailed. The example listed only two assumptions related to n. Here, maybe the main assumption is that the integral converges. \n\nAlternatively, given the example's mistake, perhaps the user wants to list the problem's variables and their conditions. Since the integral is over x from 0 to infinity, and the integrand involves sqrt(x), cos, sinh, etc., but no parameters, the only assumption is that the integral converges. \n\nTherefore, final answer:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral $$\\int_0^{\\infty } \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x}}\\left(\\frac{\\cos(\\pi x^2)}{\\sinh (\\pi x)}-\\frac{1}{\\pi x}\\right) \\, dx$$ converges.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\int_0^{\\infty } \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x}}\\left(\\frac{\\cos(\\pi x^2)}{\\sinh (\\pi x)}-\\frac{1}{\\pi x}\\right) \\, dx = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\zeta\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right).$$\n\nBut I need to check if the LaTeX is correctly formatted. The original problem had a typo with a missing closing brace in the integrand. Let me correct that. The original integral was written as:\n\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x}}\\left[\\frac{\\cos(\\pi x^2)}{\\sinh (\\pi x)}-\\frac{1}{\\pi x}\\right]\n\nThere's a missing closing } for the \\cos argument. It should be \\cos(\\pi x^2) with a closing ). So in the formatted version, I need to fix that. Also, in the example, the LaTeX uses \\left( ... \\right), so I'll adjust accordingly.\n\nFinal check:\n\nThe integrand is correctly written as \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x}}\\left(\\frac{\\cos(\\pi x^2)}{\\sinh(\\pi x)} - \\frac{1}{\\pi x}\\right). Also, the upper limit is \\infty.\n\nSo the final formatted problem should have the integral properly written with corrected parentheses.",
