    "Content": "Given a complete Riemannian manifold $M$ and point $p\\in M$ , denote $\\mathrm{Cut}_p$ the cut locus of $p$ and $\\mathrm{Cut}_p^1\\subset \\mathrm{Cut}_p$ the set of points $q$ which are connected to $p$ by more than one length minimising geodesic. According to a remark in Sakai's Riemannian geometry book (Rmk. 4.9), the latter forms a dense subset - but I don't understand why. Question: Why is $\\mathrm{Cut}_p^1\\subset \\mathrm{Cut}_p$ dense? (I use density in this answer on MO. Comments on how to avoid this property to prove regularity of Riemannian distance function are also very welcome.)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "As user Chee kindly pointed out to me in a comment on MO one can use the following result from Klingenberg's Riemannian geometry book (Theorem 2.1.12): Theorem. On a complete Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ , if $\\mathrm{ker}(d\\exp_p\\vert_v)\\neq 0$ for some $(p,v)\\in TM$ , then $\\exp_p$ fails to be injective in every neighbourhood of $v$ . (Thus if injectivity fails infinitesimally, it also fails in every neighbourhood. This is of course false for a general smooth map.) Now to conclude, take $x \\in \\mathrm{Cut}_p\\backslash \\mathrm{Cut}_p^1$ , and note that $x=\\exp_p(v)$ for some $v\\in T_pM$ with $\\mathrm{ker}(d\\exp_p\\vert_v)\\neq 0$ (cf. Petersen Lemma 5.78). Take a sequence of opens $U_1\\supset U_2\\supset\\dots\\subset T_pM$ with $\\bigcap U_n=\\{v\\}$ , then according to the theorem above $\\exp_p$ fails to be injective on each $U_n$ and thus $\\exists x_n\\in \\mathrm{Cut}_p^1\\cap\\exp_p{U_n}$ . Clearly $x_n\\rightarrow x$ and thus we have proved the density $\\mathrm{Cut}^1_p\\subset \\mathrm{Cut}_p$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to break down this problem. The user is asking why the set Cut_p^1 is dense in Cut_p for a complete Riemannian manifold M and a point p in M. \n\nFirst, I need to recall some definitions. The cut locus, Cut_p, consists of all points q in M such that the minimal geodesic from p to q is no longer minimizing beyond q. Then, Cut_p^1 is the subset of Cut_p where there are at least two distinct minimizing geodesics from p to q. \n\nThe problem refers to Sakai's book, Remark 4.9, which states that Cut_p^1 is dense in Cut_p. The user is confused about why this is true. \n\nLet me think about the structure of the cut locus. In Riemannian geometry, the cut locus is a closed set. Its complement is the set of points where the exponential map is a diffeomorphism. The points in Cut_p^1 are those where multiple geodesics meet, which I think are called \"conjugate points\" if they're related to the exponential map being singular, but here it's about having multiple minimizing geodesics. \n\nDensity would mean that any neighborhood around a point in Cut_p contains a point from Cut_p^1. So, given any q in Cut_p, we need to find points in Cut_p^1 arbitrarily close to q. \n\nMaybe this has to do with the structure of the cut locus. The cut locus is known to have measure zero and is often a stratified set. The strata might correspond to the number of minimizing geodesics. The top-dimensional stratum could be the points with exactly two minimizing geodesics, and higher strata could have more. But density would require that points with at least two are everywhere. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps by using the fact that the set of points with exactly two minimizing geodesics is dense. Wait, Sakai says \"more than one\", so Cut_p^1 includes points with two, three, etc. Maybe the argument is that points with exactly two are dense. \n\nAnother approach: consider that the cut locus is the closure of the set of points where there are two or more minimizing geodesics. If that's the case, then by definition, Cut_p^1 would be dense. But why is that the closure?\n\nWait, in some manifolds, the cut locus can have points with a single minimizing geodesic only if they are endpoints or something. Maybe in most cases, the \"generic\" points in the cut locus have multiple geodesics. \n\nAlternatively, consider that if a point q is in Cut_p but has only one minimizing geodesic, then small perturbations might create points with two geodesics. For example, imagine on a sphere: the cut locus of a point is its antipodal point. But each antipodal point has infinitely many minimizing geodesics. Wait, but on a sphere, maybe this example isn't fitting. \n\nWait, in a generic manifold, the cut locus can have more complicated structure. But perhaps, the points with multiple geodesics are dense because any point in the cut locus is a limit of such points. For example, if you take a point q in Cut_p with one minimizing geodesic, then maybe by varying the direction slightly, you can get points where two geodesics meet. \n\nAnother idea: using the fact that the set of points with conjugate points is dense? No, conjugate points are different; they are related to the exponential map being singular. \n\nWait, maybe using the structure of the cut locus as being the closure of the set of points where there are exactly two minimizing geodesics. If that's a standard result, then Cut_p^1 would contain that closure, making it dense. But I need to recall if such a theorem exists. \n\nIn Sakai's book, Remark 4.9, he might be referring to this fact. The key idea is likely that any point in the cut locus is either a point with multiple minimizing geodesics or a limit of such points. To see why, suppose there's a point q in Cut_p with only one minimizing geodesic. Then, perhaps nearby points must have at least two, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, think about the distance function from p. The set where the distance function is not differentiable is exactly the cut locus, and the points where it's not differentiable in more than one direction correspond to having multiple geodesics. Then, the set of points where the distance function has multiple directional derivatives (i.e., non-differentiable in multiple directions) should be dense in the cut locus. \n\nAnother angle: the cut locus can be decomposed into the set of points where there are multiple minimizing geodesics (Cut_p^1) and the set where there's exactly one. If the latter is not dense, then Cut_p^1 must be dense. But why is the set with exactly one geodesic not dense?\n\nMaybe using the Baire category theorem. The cut locus is a complete metric space (since M is complete and Cut_p is closed), so if Cut_p^1 is a countable intersection of open dense sets, it's dense. But I'm not sure how that applies here. \n\nAlternatively, consider that the set of points with exactly one minimizing geodesic is a set of lower dimension or measure zero, hence its complement (Cut_p^1) is dense. \n\nWait, in some cases, like on a convex surface, the cut locus is a tree-like structure with points having one or two geodesics. But maybe in higher dimensions, the structure is such that multiple geodesics are generic. \n\nPerhaps the main idea is that if a point q is in Cut_p with only one minimizing geodesic, then perturbing q along directions orthogonal to that geodesic would lead to points where another geodesic becomes minimizing, hence creating a point in Cut_p^1. Therefore, such points are dense. \n\nBut how to formalize this? Maybe using the fact that the exponential map is a smooth map, and the set of points where there's a unique minimizing geodesic corresponds to certain conditions on the differential of the exponential map. If those conditions are not stable under perturbations, then such points are not dense. \n\nAlternatively, consider that the set of points with unique minimizing geodesic is closed. If that's the case, then its complement (Cut_p^1) would be open, but since the cut locus is closed, this might not hold. Wait, but if Cut_p^1 is dense, it doesn't have to be open. \n\nThis is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should look up the structure of the cut locus. From what I remember, in Riemannian geometry, the cut locus is the closure of the set of points with exactly two minimizing geodesics. If that's the case, then Cut_p^1, which includes all points with two or more, would be dense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the argument is that the cut locus is the closure of the set of points where the distance function is not differentiable, which corresponds to having multiple directions of differentiability, hence multiple geodesics. \n\nWait, the distance function from p is smooth except on the cut locus. At points in the cut locus, the differentiability fails, and the set where it fails in more than one direction (i.e., multiple supporting geodesics) would be dense. \n\nAlternatively, using the fact that the set of points with conjugate points is dense? No, conjugate points are related to the exponential map's critical points, which is different. \n\nMaybe Sakai's remark relies on the fact that in a complete Riemannian manifold, the set of points with multiple minimizing geodesics is dense in the cut locus. The reasoning might involve taking a point q in Cut_p and showing that arbitrarily close to q, there are points where two minimizing geodesics from p meet. \n\nAnother approach is to consider the function that assigns to each point the number of minimizing geodesics from p. This function is lower semicontinuous, meaning that if a point has k geodesics, nearby points have at least k. So, the set where the number is ≥2 is closed? Wait, but that would mean that Cut_p^1 is closed, which contradicts the idea that it's dense. Wait, maybe not. If the function is lower semicontinuous, then the set where the number is ≥2 is closed. Therefore, Cut_p^1 would be closed. But the problem states that it's dense. \n\nHmm, this seems conflicting. If Cut_p^1 is closed and dense in Cut_p, then it must be the entire Cut_p. But that can't be, because there are points in the cut locus with only one minimizing geodesic. For example, on a cylinder, the cut locus of a point is a line, and points on that line have two minimizing geodesics except at certain points where maybe they have one? Wait, maybe not. On a cylinder, which is flat, the cut locus is a line, and each point on that line has two minimizing geodesics. So maybe in some manifolds, all points in the cut locus have multiple geodesics. But in others, like a teardrop-shaped manifold, maybe there's a single point at the tip with one geodesic. \n\nBut the problem states that Cut_p^1 is dense in Cut_p, not necessarily the entire set. So perhaps in general, except for certain manifolds, the set of points with multiple geodesics is dense. \n\nThe key idea might be that any point in the cut locus with a unique minimizing geodesic can be approximated by points where another geodesic becomes minimizing, hence entering Cut_p^1. \n\nFor example, take a point q in Cut_p with a single minimizing geodesic γ. If we perturb q slightly along a direction perpendicular to γ, perhaps there's another geodesic that becomes minimizing, giving a nearby point in Cut_p^1. \n\nTo make this precise, one might use the fact that the cut locus is the closure of the set of points where there are at least two minimizing geodesics. This could be a standard result in Riemannian geometry, referenced in Sakai's book. \n\nAlternatively, consider that the cut locus is the set of points where the distance function from p is not differentiable. The set where the distance function has more than one subgradient (i.e., multiple directions) is dense in the cut locus. \n\nAnother angle: the set of points with unique minimizing geodesic is a set of lower dimension in the cut locus, hence its complement is dense. \n\nOverall, I think the main assumption here is that the manifold is complete, which ensures that the exponential map is defined for all vectors, and the structure of the cut locus follows certain properties. The problem is to show that within the cut locus, the points with multiple minimizing geodesics are dense. \n\nThe formatted problem should list the assumptions: M is a complete Riemannian manifold, p is a point in M, Cut_p is the cut locus of p, and Cut_p^1 is the subset with multiple minimizing geodesics. The problem is to prove that Cut_p^1 is dense in Cut_p.",
