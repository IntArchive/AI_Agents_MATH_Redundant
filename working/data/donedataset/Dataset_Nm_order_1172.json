    "Content": "I know it might be too easy for you guys here. I'm practicing some problems in the textbook, but this one really drove me crazy. From $\\gcd( a, b ) = 1$, I have $ax + by = 1$, where should I go from here? The extra $ac$ is so annoying. Any hint? Thanks, Chan",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Setup : Let $d_1 = \\gcd(c,b)$ and $d_2 = \\gcd(ac,b)$ . So we have $cx_1 + by_1 = d_1$ , $acx_2 + by_2 = d_2$ , and $ax + by = 1$ by Bezout. Step 1 : Multiply $ax+by = 1$ by $d_1$ (using $d_1 := cx_1 + by_1$ ) and rearrange to show that $d_2|d_1$ . $$\\begin{aligned}\nd_1 (ax+by &= 1)\\\\\n\\implies ax(cx_1 + by_1) + bd_1y &= d_1 \\\\\n\\implies a c (x x_1) + b(a x y_1 + d_1 y) &= d_1\n\\end{aligned}$$ Since we know that $d_2 = \\gcd(ac,b)$ divides any integer linear combination of $ac$ and $b$ , we have $d_2 | d_1$ . Step 2 : By a similar argument, multiply $ax+by = 1$ by $d_2$ (using $d_2 := acx_2 + by_2$ ) and rearrange to show that $d_1|d_2$ . $$\\begin{aligned}\nd_2 (ax+by &= 1) \\\\\n\\implies ax(acx_2 + by_2) + bd_2y &= d_2 \\\\\n\\implies c (a^2 x x_2) + b(a x y_2 + d_2 y) &= d_2\n\\end{aligned}$$ Since we know that $d_1 = \\gcd(c,b)$ divides any integer linear combination of $c$ and $b$ , we have $d_1 | d_2$ . Conclusion : Finally, because we have $d_1 | d_2$ , $d_2 | d_1$ , and $d_1$ and $d_2$ are non-negative (since they are the gcd of two integers), we conclude that $d_1 = d_2$ . Thus, $gcd(ac,b)=gcd(c,b)$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So the question is: Prove that if gcd(a, b) = 1, then gcd(ac, b) = gcd(c, b). Hmm, right. The user mentioned they know that gcd(a, b) = 1 implies there exist integers x and y such that ax + by = 1. They're stuck on how to handle the ac term. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some properties of gcds. One important property is that gcd(ac, b) divides both ac and b. Since gcd(a, b) is 1, a and b are coprime. That might mean that any common divisors of ac and b must come from c and b. Because a and b share no common factors, the common factors between ac and b would be the same as those between c and b. That seems like the intuition, but how to formalize it?\n\nMaybe I can use the Bézout's identity approach. Since ax + by = 1, multiply both sides by c: acx + bcy = c. Now, suppose d is a common divisor of ac and b. Then d divides acx and d divides bcy, so d divides their sum, which is c. Therefore, d divides c and d divides b, so d is a common divisor of c and b. Conversely, if d divides c and b, then d divides ac and b. Therefore, the set of common divisors of ac and b is the same as that of c and b, so their gcds must be equal.\n\nWait, that seems like a solid argument. Let me check each step. Start with d = gcd(ac, b). Then d divides ac and d divides b. Since gcd(a, b) = 1, d must divide c. Because d divides ac and d divides b, and a and b are coprime, d can't share any factors with a, so d must divide c. Hence, d divides gcd(c, b). Conversely, gcd(c, b) divides c and b, so it divides ac and b, hence divides gcd(ac, b). Therefore, they are equal.\n\nAlternatively, using prime factorization: Since a and b are coprime, their prime factors are disjoint. The gcd of ac and b would be the product of primes common to c and b, since a doesn't contribute any. So gcd(ac, b) = gcd(c, b). That's another way to see it.\n\nBut the problem probably expects a proof using Bézout or the properties of gcd rather than prime factorization. The original user mentioned starting with ax + by = 1. Multiplying by c gives a way to express c in terms of ac and b, which might be useful in showing that any common divisor of ac and b must divide c, thereby linking it to gcd(c, b).\n\nAnother approach: Use the formula that gcd(ac, b) = gcd(c, b) when gcd(a, b) = 1. This is a standard result in number theory. The key idea is that since a and b are coprime, the common divisors of ac and b can't come from a, so they must come from c and b. Thus, their gcds are equal.\n\nI think the user's main challenge is connecting the given condition gcd(a, b) = 1 to the relationship involving ac and b. By expanding the Bézout identity, they can introduce c into the equation and then use properties of divisibility to show the required equality of gcds. The step of multiplying the Bézout equation by c is clever because it allows expressing c as a combination of ac and b, which directly relates to the gcd in question.\n\nSo, structuring this into assumptions and the problem: The original problem states that gcd(a, b) = 1. The problem is to prove that gcd(ac, b) = gcd(c, b). The key assumption here is that a and b are coprime. There are no other conditions mentioned, so the assumptions section should list that gcd(a, b) = 1. The problem is exactly as stated.",
