    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to structure this problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The original question is about showing that a certain product of variables raised to exponents equals 1, given some equal ratios involving logarithms.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that (log x)/(b - c) = (log y)/(c - a) = (log z)/(a - b). Then, they need to show that x^{b+c-a} * y^{c+a-b} * z^{a+b-c} = 1.\n\nLooking at the example provided, each assumption should be a single condition applied to one object. Here, the main given is the equality of three ratios. So, the key assumption is that these three ratios are equal. The variables involved are x, y, z, and the constants a, b, c. There's no mention of restrictions on a, b, c, x, y, z, but since logarithms are involved, I should assume that x, y, z are positive real numbers (because log is only defined for positive numbers). Also, the denominators b - c, c - a, a - b must not be zero, so a, b, c must be distinct. However, the problem statement doesn't explicitly state these, so should I include them as assumptions?\n\nThe example given in the original instruction included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, even though the original problem only said \"for every integer n\". But in that case, maybe the user wants explicit assumptions even if they are part of the problem's given conditions. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, maybe the example is incorrect? Or maybe the example was a different problem. Wait, looking back: the example's original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem lists n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That seems like an error because 91 is 13*7, so maybe the problem requires n to be divisible by both 7 and 13? Hmm, maybe that example was a mistake. But regardless, the user's instruction is to list all assumptions line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object.\n\nIn the current problem, the given is that the three ratios are equal. So the first assumption is that (log x)/(b - c) = (log y)/(c - a) = (log z)/(a - b). Then, perhaps also assumptions that x, y, z are positive real numbers (since logarithm is defined only for positive numbers), and that a, b, c are distinct (so denominators are non-zero). But the original problem didn't state these, so maybe the user wants us to list implicit assumptions? Or only the explicit ones? The user's example included an assumption that n is an integer (which was explicit in the problem) and an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7 (which wasn't in the original problem, but maybe necessary for the divisibility by 91). Hmm, perhaps the example had a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a typo or required n to be divisible by 7. \n\nBut in the current problem, the user's example in the problem shows that the user made three equations via cross-multiplication. So maybe the key assumption is the equality of the three ratios, and that a, b, c are distinct. But since the problem statement doesn't mention that, perhaps we shouldn't include it unless it's necessary. However, to avoid division by zero, we need the denominators b - c, c - a, a - b to be non-zero. So a, b, c must all be distinct. That's an implicit assumption. Similarly, x, y, z must be positive. But the problem statement doesn't specify that. However, since log is used, it's necessary. So maybe we need to list those as assumptions.\n\nBut in the original example provided by the user, the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem just said \"for every integer n\". So in that case, maybe the example was incorrect, but the user's instruction is to list all assumptions, even if they are part of the problem's given conditions. So perhaps in the current problem, the main assumption is the equality of the three ratios, and then the variables being positive, and a, b, c being distinct. But the problem statement doesn't explicitly state the variables are positive or that a, b, c are distinct, but those are necessary conditions. So perhaps we need to include them as assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. log x, log y, log z are defined (i.e., x, y, z are positive real numbers).\n2. The denominators b - c, c - a, a - b are non-zero (i.e., a, b, c are distinct).\n3. The ratios (log x)/(b - c), (log y)/(c - a), (log z)/(a - b) are equal.\n\nWait, but the original problem only states the equality of the three ratios. The other assumptions (variables positive, denominators non-zero) are implicit. So perhaps the user wants only the explicit assumptions listed. But according to the example, sometimes implicit assumptions (like n being an integer) are listed. Wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", so \"n is an integer\" is an explicit assumption. The second assumption \"n is divisible by 7\" was not in the original problem, so that seems to be a mistake. Unless perhaps the user's example had a typo. Hmm. Maybe the example was from a different problem. Anyway, the user's instruction says \"filter the unrelated informations\", so perhaps we should list only the necessary assumptions given in the problem. The problem states the equality of the three ratios. The rest (like variables being positive, a, b, c distinct) are necessary for the problem to make sense but not explicitly stated. Should we include them as assumptions? The user's example didn't include implicit assumptions. For example, in the example, the problem didn't state that 5 and 6 are integers or anything, but the formatted problem didn't include that. So maybe we should list only the explicit assumptions. The original problem here says \"Given (log x)/(b - c) = (log y)/(c - a) = (log z)/(a - b)\", so the main assumption is that these three ratios are equal. So perhaps only that is listed as the assumption, and the rest (variables positive, a, b, c distinct) are not listed because they are considered part of the problem's context. So maybe the assumption section should just have one line: the equality of the three ratios. But the user's example in the original problem had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So perhaps in cases where there are multiple conditions, even if they are part of the problem's given, they should be split into separate lines. Wait, in the example, the problem said \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is \"n is an integer\". But the second assumption \"n is divisible by 7\" was not in the original problem. So that example might be incorrect. Maybe the user made a mistake there. But regardless, for the current problem, perhaps the only assumption is that the three ratios are equal. But according to the user's example, they split the problem's given into separate assumptions. Wait, no. In the example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem's assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that's conflicting because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems wrong. Unless there was a misinterpretation. Maybe the original problem actually had a condition that n is divisible by 7, but the user's example had a typo. Alternatively, maybe the problem was to prove divisibility by 91 when n is divisible by 7. But given that 91 is 13*7, perhaps the divisibility holds for all n, but the example was incorrectly formatted. This confusion suggests that perhaps the user's example is not reliable. Therefore, to follow the current problem, perhaps we should list the main given as the assumption, which is the equality of the three ratios. Then the problem is to show the product equals 1. So the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption: \nThe ratios \\(\\dfrac{\\log x}{b - c} = \\dfrac{\\log y}{c - a} = \\dfrac{\\log z}{a - b}\\) are equal.\n\nProblem: \nShow that \\(x^{b + c - a} \\cdot y^{c + a - b} \\cdot z^{a + b - c} = 1\\).\n\nBut according to the example, even if the original problem's given is one statement, maybe we need to split it into separate assumptions. For example, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", which became \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Alternatively, perhaps the example is correct, and the original problem had a different condition. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants each part of the given to be an assumption. In this problem, the given is the equality of three ratios. So the assumption is that those three ratios are equal. Then, maybe each equality between two ratios is a separate assumption? For example:\n\nAssumption:\n\\(\\dfrac{\\log x}{b - c} = \\dfrac{\\log y}{c - a}\\),\n\\(\\dfrac{\\log y}{c - a} = \\dfrac{\\log z}{a - b}\\),\n\\(\\dfrac{\\log z}{a - b} = \\dfrac{\\log x}{b - c}\\).\n\nBut that seems redundant because if the three ratios are equal, then any two are equal. However, the user's example had one assumption line for each condition. For instance, in the example, the original problem had one condition (for every integer n), but the formatted problem split it into two assumptions. But that example might be an error. Therefore, perhaps for the current problem, the assumption is just the single statement that the three ratios are equal. However, in the user's example, even though the original problem had one given, the formatted problem split it into two assumptions. That seems incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the user's example is not a good guide. Therefore, to be safe, I should list the single assumption that the three ratios are equal. Also, considering the problem's context, maybe we need to include that a, b, c are distinct and x, y, z are positive. But the problem statement didn't mention those, so perhaps they are considered implicit and not listed. However, in mathematical problems, such conditions are often assumed, but if the user wants them listed, we should. But the example didn't include implicit assumptions. So I think the answer is:\n\nAssumption:\nThe ratios \\(\\dfrac{\\log x}{b - c} = \\dfrac{\\log y}{c - a} = \\dfrac{\\log z}{a - b}\\) are equal.\n\nProblem:\nShow that \\(x^{b + c - a} \\cdot y^{c + a - b} \\cdot z^{a + b - c} = 1\\).\n\nBut the user's example had two assumptions for a problem with one given. So maybe there's a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps in the current problem, the three ratios being equal can be split into multiple equalities. But in reality, the equality of three ratios is a single condition. However, the user's example shows splitting a single condition into two assumptions. For example, in the original problem, the given was \"for every integer n\", which became two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That seems wrong. Therefore, perhaps the user's example is incorrect, and we should follow the problem as stated. So for this problem, the assumption is the equality of the three ratios. Therefore, the formatted problem should be as above.",
