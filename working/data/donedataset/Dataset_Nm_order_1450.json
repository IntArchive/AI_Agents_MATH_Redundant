    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here's a very easy to prove lower bound: Consider the product of all primes less than $n$, call it $P_n$.  Let the largest prime less than $n$ be $q_n$.  There must be a prime on $[q_n+1, P_n+1]$ (this is because $P_n+1$ must itself be prime or be divisible by some other prime, but isn't divisible by any prime less than or equal to $q_n$).  Clearly, $P_n+1\\leq n!$ for $n>2,n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ Given that $\\pi(3)=2$, we see that $\\pi(3!)=\\pi(6)\\geq2+1=3$, then $\\pi(6!)\\geq4$ In general $\\pi(3\\underbrace{!!...!!}_{n})\\geq n+1$ Interpolation is easy, let $\\pi(n)=\\pi(k)$ for $k=\\sup\\{3\\underbrace{!!...!!}_{m}|3\\underbrace{!!...!!}_{m}\\leq n\\}$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so the user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure a problem from Math Stack Exchange into their specified format. Let me look at the example they provided first to make sure I understand the requirements.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was about proving that a certain expression A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted version under \"Assumption\" lists two points: that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, it says \"for every integer n\", so why does the assumption include that n is divisible by 7? That seems contradictory. Oh, maybe the example had a mistake, or perhaps the original problem had a typo? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to modify the problem when creating the example. Regardless, the key takeaway is that assumptions should list each condition applied to one object, line by line.\n\nNow, the current problem to format is from Math Stack Exchange with the title: \"What is the simplest lower bound on prime counting functions proof wise?\" The question is asking for a simple complete proof of a lower bound on the prime counting function that doesn't rely on more complex theories.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions from the problem. The problem is about finding a lower bound on the prime counting function, which counts the number of primes less than or equal to x. The user wants a proof that's simple and doesn't hinge on complex theories. However, assumptions in the format should be specific conditions or properties applied to objects in the problem. \n\nLooking at the original problem, the main assumptions here might be implicit. The prime counting function π(x) is typically defined for real numbers x ≥ 2, but maybe there's a specific range or condition on x here. However, the question as stated doesn't specify any particular conditions on x except that it's asking about a lower bound. The user is seeking a lower bound, so perhaps the assumption is that x is a real number greater than or equal to 2 (since primes start at 2). Also, the proof should be elementary, so maybe an assumption is that the proof doesn't use complex analysis or advanced theorems.\n\nBut the user's example had assumptions listed as properties of the variables in the problem. In the example, n being an integer and divisible by 7. So in this case, maybe the assumptions are about the prime counting function π(x) and the conditions on x. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem is asking for a lower bound on π(x), the prime counting function. The user wants the simplest proof possible. To structure this, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- π(x) is the prime counting function, which counts the number of primes less than or equal to x.\n- The lower bound is to be proven using elementary methods (no complex theories).\n- x is a real number greater than or equal to 2.\n\nBut the problem statement as given doesn't explicitly state all these. The user's question is more about the proof technique rather than conditions on π(x) or x. However, the format requires assumptions that address one property or condition per line applied to one object. \n\nGiven that the original problem is somewhat vague, maybe the assumptions need to be inferred. For example, assuming that we're working with the standard prime counting function, and that x is a positive real number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is seeking a lower bound valid for all x ≥ some number, like x ≥ 2. Also, the method of proof should be elementary.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumptions were about the variable (n being integer, divisible by 7). So here, perhaps the assumptions are about x. For instance, x is a real number greater than or equal to 2. However, the original problem doesn't specify, so maybe the user expects that I should state that x is a real number, x ≥ 2, and the proof must be elementary. But since the problem is asking for the simplest lower bound proof-wise, maybe the key assumption is that the proof is elementary, i.e., doesn't use complex analysis or advanced theorems like those from analytic number theory.\n\nHowever, the problem statement itself doesn't mention any conditions on x. It's possible that the user expects the structured problem to include assumptions about x, but since the original question didn't specify, maybe the only assumption is about the proof method. But the example included assumptions about the variable (n being integer, etc.), so maybe here the assumption is about x being a real number ≥ 2, which is standard for prime counting functions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's no explicit assumption needed beyond the definition of the prime counting function. Let me check the example again. The original problem in the example was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted assumptions were \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which would mean n is an integer, and the conclusion is that it's divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original. This seems like a mistake. Unless maybe there was a typo in the original problem, but according to the user's example, the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. That seems incorrect, but perhaps it's part of the user's example to show how to format. Wait, maybe the original problem was different. The user's example might have had an original problem where n is not necessarily an integer, but the formatted problem includes that n is an integer. Wait, no, the original problem in the example says \"for every integer n\", so the first assumption is correct. Then why the second assumption \"n is divisible by 7\"? That would restrict n, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so that seems contradictory. Maybe the example is flawed. Perhaps the user made an error in their example. But regardless, I need to focus on the current problem.\n\nGiven that the example's assumptions listed properties of the variables, even if they were incorrect, perhaps the user wants me to list the implicit assumptions about the problem's variables. For the current problem about the prime counting function's lower bound, the prime counting function π(x) is defined for x ≥ 2, and we're to find a lower bound. So possible assumptions:\n\n- x is a real number.\n- x ≥ 2.\n- The proof must use elementary methods (no complex analysis).\n- π(x) counts the number of primes less than or equal to x.\n\nBut the original question doesn't specify x ≥ 2, but it's standard. The problem is to find a lower bound on π(x). The question is asking for the simplest proof. So perhaps the key assumptions are about the method (elementary) and the domain of x.\n\nBut according to the user's instructions, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So let's break it down:\n\nAssumption:\n- x is a real number.\n- x ≥ 2.\n- π(x) is the prime counting function.\n- The proof must not use complex theories.\n\nBut the problem statement as given in the question is: \"What is the simplest lower bound on prime counting functions proof wise? I am trying to understand how a lower bound can exist on the prime counting function, and to begin this process of educating myself I am trying to find a simple complete proof, that does not hinge on another more complex theory.\"\n\nSo the user is asking for a lower bound on π(x) with a simple proof. The assumptions here would be about π(x) and the conditions on x. But since the problem is general, maybe the only assumption is that x is a positive real number (though technically, π(x) is defined for x ≥ 2). Alternatively, the user might be assuming basic properties of primes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem as structured should list that π(x) is the prime counting function (defining it), and that x is a real number ≥ 2. But the problem as stated doesn't mention x; it's implied. The question is about the prime counting function in general.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond the definition of π(x), but the user wants to structure the problem with assumptions. Since the example included assumptions even if they weren't all present in the original problem, maybe the assistant is supposed to infer standard assumptions.\n\nIn conclusion, to format the given problem:\n\nAssumption: π(x) is the prime counting function.\n\nBut that's too vague. Alternatively:\n\nAssumption:\n- π(x) counts the number of primes less than or equal to x.\n- x is a real number greater than or equal to 2.\n- The proof must use only elementary methods.\n\nEach of these is one line, each addressing one property or condition. Then the problem is: \"What is the simplest lower bound on π(x)?\" or as stated: \"Prove a lower bound on the prime counting function π(x) using elementary methods.\"\n\nBut the original problem's title is \"What is the simplest lower bound on prime counting functions proof wise?\" and the question is asking for a simple complete proof that doesn't rely on complex theories.\n\nSo structuring this:\n\nAssumption:\n- π(x) is the prime counting function.\n- x is a real number.\n- The proof uses only elementary number theory.\n\nProblem: Find the simplest lower bound on π(x).\n\nBut perhaps more precise. Alternatively, the problem is to prove that π(x) ≥ some expression, using elementary methods.\n\nWait, the user's example had the problem restated with the mathematical expression. In this case, maybe the problem is to prove a specific lower bound, like π(x) ≥ log x or something, but the original question doesn't specify which lower bound. The user is asking for the simplest lower bound in terms of the proof.\n\nIn the absence of a specific lower bound in the question, perhaps the problem is as stated: \"What is the simplest lower bound on prime counting functions proof wise?\" So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- π(x) is the prime counting function.\n- x is a real number greater than or equal to 2.\n- The proof must be elementary (no complex theories).\n\nProblem: Find the simplest lower bound on π(x).\n\nBut I need to check if the original question mentions any specific conditions. The original question says: \"I am trying to understand how a lower bound can exist on the prime counting function, and to begin this process of educating myself I am trying to find a simple complete proof, that does not hinge on another more complex theory.\"\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. π(x) counts the number of primes ≤ x.\n2. The proof must use elementary methods (no complex theories).\n3. x is a real number ≥ 2.\n\nProblem: Prove a lower bound on π(x).\n\nAlternatively, if the simplest lower bound is something like π(x) ≥ log x / log log x for x ≥ 3, but the user might just want the existence of a lower bound. However, since the problem asks for \"the simplest lower bound\", maybe the answer is to prove that π(x) ≥ C * x / log x for some constant C, but that's actually the Prime Number Theorem, which is more advanced. However, weaker lower bounds can be proven elementarily, like π(x) ≥ log x or similar.\n\nWait, the Chebyshev theorem gives that there exist constants such that c1 x / log x ≤ π(x) ≤ c2 x / log x, but that's still not the simplest. Maybe even simpler, like π(x) ≥ 1 for x ≥ 2, which is trivial but not useful. But the user probably wants a non-trivial lower bound.\n\nAlternatively, using Euclid's theorem that there are infinitely many primes, one can derive that π(x) → ∞ as x → ∞, but that's a very weak lower bound. But the question is about a lower bound on π(x), not just asymptotic behavior.\n\nAlternatively, one elementary lower bound comes from considering that every number can be written as a product of primes, and using an argument similar to Erdős's proof of the divergence of the sum of reciprocals of primes. Or perhaps consider primes in certain intervals.\n\nWait, another approach: consider that in the sieve of Eratosthenes, the number of primes up to x is at least something. For example, using the inclusion-exclusion principle, but that's complicated.\n\nAlternatively, a simple lower bound can be established by considering that every composite number up to x has a prime factor ≤ sqrt(x). But I'm not sure how that gives a lower bound on π(x).\n\nAlternatively, note that the number of primes up to x is at least the number of primes in the sequence 2,3,...,x. If we can show that there are at least some number of primes, like π(x) ≥ log x / 2, perhaps by induction or another method.\n\nAlternatively, consider that for x ≥ 4, there exists a prime between x and 2x (Bertrand's postulate), which implies π(2x) ≥ π(x) +1. By induction, this gives π(2^n) ≥ n, so π(x) ≥ log x / log 2 - 1. But Bertrand's postulate requires a proof, which is elementary but non-trivial.\n\nHowever, the user wants the simplest proof possible. The simplest non-trivial lower bound I can think of is π(x) ≥ log_2 x for x ≥ 2. How? For x=2, π(2)=1 ≥1. For x=4, primes are 2,3 so π(4)=2 ≥2. For x=8, primes up to 8 are 2,3,5,7 → π(8)=4 ≥3. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, using induction with Bertrand's postulate.\n\nWait, maybe the simplest lower bound is π(x) ≥ 1 for x ≥2, but that's trivial. The user probably wants something that grows with x. Let me recall that in Hardy and Wright's book, they show that π(x) tends to infinity by considering the product of primes up to x, but that might not directly give a lower bound.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the number of primes less than or equal to x is at least the number of distinct prime factors of the binomial coefficient C(2n, n). But that's more involved.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that if there were only k primes up to x, then every number up to x can be factored into these primes, leading to a contradiction via counting arguments. For example, if there are k primes up to x, then the number of products of the form p_1^{e_1}...p_k^{e_k} ≤x is at most (log x / log 2 +1)^k, which is less than x for large x, implying k must grow. This gives a lower bound like k ≥ log x / log log x or something. But this requires some steps.\n\nBut the user wants the simplest proof. The counting argument I mentioned is perhaps one of the simplest elementary proofs that π(x) is unbounded and gives a weak lower bound. However, to structure the problem, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- π(x) is the prime counting function.\n- x is a real number ≥ 2.\n- The proof uses only combinatorial arguments or elementary number theory.\n\nProblem: Prove that π(x) ≥ (log x)/(log log x) for sufficiently large x.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the exact bound. Alternatively, the problem could be to show that π(x) → ∞ as x → ∞, but that's not a quantitative lower bound.\n\nAlternatively, the simplest lower bound might be π(n) ≥ log n / log 2 for integers n ≥2, derived from considering binary representations or the prime factors of n!.\n\nWait, another approach: using the fact that n! is divisible by all primes up to n. Then, the product of primes up to n divides n!, so the product of primes up to n is ≤ n!. Taking logs, sum_{p ≤n} log p ≤ log n! ≤ n log n (by Stirling's approximation or simpler). Then, if there are k primes up to n, each at least 2, so the product is ≥2^k. Hence, 2^k ≤n! ⇒k ≤ log n! / log 2 ≤ n log n / log 2. But that gives an upper bound, not lower.\n\nAlternatively, to get a lower bound, maybe use that the number of primes must be at least something. Maybe consider the multiplicative partitions, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider that for each prime p ≤x, it contributes at least 1 to the count, so π(x) ≥1. But that's trivial.\n\nGiven that the user is asking for the simplest proof-wise lower bound, perhaps the answer refers to Euclid's theorem proof that there are infinitely many primes, hence π(x) → ∞ as x → ∞, which is a lower bound in the sense that for any N, there exists x such that π(x) ≥N. But this is a very weak lower bound, not quantitative.\n\nHowever, the problem might be seeking a quantitative lower bound, like π(x) ≥ log x or similar. But the question is phrased as \"the simplest lower bound on prime counting functions proof wise,\" so perhaps the answer is a bound that can be proven with the simplest method, even if it's not the tightest.\n\nConsidering all this, perhaps the structured problem is:\n\nAssumption:\n- π(x) is the prime counting function.\n- x is a real number ≥ 2.\n- The proof must use elementary methods.\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists a constant C > 0 such that π(x) ≥ C * x / log x for all sufficiently large x.\n\nBut this is the Chebyshev bound, which is more advanced. Alternatively, a weaker bound like π(x) ≥ log x.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the simplest non-trivial lower bound is π(x) ≥ 1 for x ≥2, but that's trivial. The next step is to use Euclid's argument to show π(x) can be made arbitrarily large, hence for any N, π(x) ≥N for sufficiently large x. But that's not a concrete lower bound in terms of x.\n\nAlternatively, using the Chinese Remainder Theorem or some other elementary method to show that there are at least log x primes up to x. But I'm not sure of the exact approach.\n\nIn any case, the problem as asked is to structure the original question into the specified format. The original question is: \"What is the simplest lower bound on prime counting functions proof wise? I am trying to understand how a lower bound can exist on the prime counting function, and to begin this process of educating myself I am trying to find a simple complete proof, that does not hinge on another more complex theory.\"\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would list assumptions about π(x), x being real ≥2, and the proof being elementary. The problem is to find/prove the simplest lower bound.\n\nFinal structured answer:\n\nAssumption:\n- π(x) is the prime counting function.\n- x is a real number greater than or equal to 2.\n- The proof uses only elementary number theory.\n\nProblem: What is the simplest lower bound on π(x) that can be proven without relying on complex theories?\n\nBut since the example used \"Prove that...\", maybe the problem should be phrased as \"Prove a lower bound on π(x) using elementary methods.\"\n\nBut the original question is asking for the simplest lower bound in terms of the proof's simplicity. So perhaps the problem is to find such a bound and prove it.\n\nAlternatively, the problem as structured in the example had a specific mathematical expression. Here, since the original question is more general, the problem statement would remain as is, but structured.\n\nThus, after this lengthy thinking, I'll format it as:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nπ(x) is the prime counting function,\nx is a real number greater than or equal to 2,\nthe proof must use elementary methods without complex theories.\nProblem: \nWhat is the simplest lower bound on the prime counting function π(x) that can be proven with elementary methods?",
