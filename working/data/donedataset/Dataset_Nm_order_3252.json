    "Content": "There is no continuous mapping from $L^1([0,1])$ onto $L^\\infty([0,1])$. Proof: suppose $T:L^1 \\rightarrow L^\\infty$ continuous and onto. $L^1$ is separable, let $\\{f_n\\}$  be a countable dense subset. If $T$ is onto, for each $g\\in L^\\infty$, $g = Tf$ for some $f\\in L^1$, and we can approximate $g$ with $Tf_{n_k}$ since $T$ is continuous. We get the contradiction that $\\{Tf_n\\}$ is a countable dense subset of $L^\\infty$. Is this okay? thank you very much!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Fix $\\varepsilon>0$ and $g\\in L^{\\infty}([0,1])$. If $T$ is surjective, then $g=T(f)$ for some $f\\in L^1([0,1])$, indeed. By the continuity of $T$ at $f$, there exists some $\\delta>0$ such that\n\\begin{align*}\n\\left.\\begin{array}{ll}\\bullet\\,h\\in L^1([0,1])\\\\\\bullet\\,\\|h-f\\|_1<\\delta\\end{array}\\right\\}\\Longrightarrow\\|T(h)-T(f)\\|_{\\infty}=\\|T(h)-g\\|_{\\infty}<\\varepsilon.\n\\end{align*} NB : It is not assumed that $T$ is linear! (If $T$ is linear, one could, alternatively, use a similar argument based on its operator norm.) By the denseness of $\\{f_n\\}_{n\\in\\mathbb N}$, there exists some $n\\in\\mathbb N$ such that $\\|f_n-f\\|_1<\\delta$. It follows that $\\|T(f_n)-g\\|_{\\infty}<\\varepsilon$. Therefore, $\\{T(f_n)\\}_{n\\in\\mathbb N}$ is dense in $L^{\\infty}([0,1])$, so $L^{\\infty}([0,1])$ is separable—which is impossible. Short answer: yes.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to break down this problem. The user is asking about the correctness of a proof that there's no continuous mapping from L^1([0,1]) onto L^∞([0,1]). The original proof presented argues by using separability. Let me parse through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the assumptions. The problem states that we need to show there's no continuous surjective map from L^1 to L^∞. The user's proof assumes the existence of such a map T. Then, since L^1 is separable, there's a countable dense subset {f_n}. If T is continuous and onto, then every g in L^∞ is T(f) for some f in L^1. Then, because T is continuous, the image of the dense subset {f_n} under T should be dense in L^∞. But L^∞ is not separable, so having a countable dense subset would be a contradiction. Therefore, such a T cannot exist.\n\nNow, the user is asking if this proof is okay. To structure the problem correctly, I need to list the assumptions and the problem statement. Let's see:\n\nAssumptions would be:\n1. T is a continuous mapping from L^1([0,1]) to L^∞([0,1]).\n2. T is surjective (onto).\n3. L^1([0,1]) is separable.\n4. L^∞([0,1]) is not separable.\n\nEach of these should be listed as separate points. The problem is to prove the initial statement that there's no such continuous mapping. The user's proof is using these properties, so the key assumptions here are the continuity and surjectivity of T, along with the separability of L^1 and non-separability of L^∞.\n\nWait, but in the example provided, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7, but in this case, the problem is about properties of function spaces. So the assumptions here are about the mapping T being continuous and onto, and the separability of the spaces involved. The problem is to show that such a mapping can't exist.\n\nSo putting it into the required format:\n\nAssumption:\nT: L^1([0,1]) → L^∞([0,1]) is a continuous mapping,\nT is surjective,\nL^1([0,1]) is separable,\nL^∞([0,1]) is not separable.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there is no continuous mapping from L^1([0,1]) onto L^∞([0,1]).\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user is asking if their proof is correct. However, according to the task, we need to structure the problem as per the given example, which involves stating the assumptions and the problem. The user's question includes their own proof attempt, but the task is to extract the problem's assumptions and the problem statement itself, not to evaluate the proof.\n\nTherefore, the key elements are the spaces involved, the properties of T (continuous and onto), and the separability vs. non-separability. So the assumptions should list each of these properties as separate points. The problem is to prove the non-existence of such a mapping.\n\nSo, finalizing:\n\nAssumption:\n- There exists a continuous mapping T from L^1([0,1]) to L^∞([0,1]),\n- T is surjective,\n- L^1([0,1]) is a separable space,\n- L^∞([0,1]) is a non-separable space.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there is no continuous mapping from L^1([0,1]) onto L^∞([0,1]).\n\nBut wait, in the example, the assumptions included specific conditions on n, but here, the problem is to show the non-existence. The user's proof uses the separability argument. So the problem's assumptions are the properties that lead to the contradiction. However, perhaps the problem statement as given in the original question is the main problem to be proven, and the assumptions are the given conditions in the problem. But in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer, but the user's formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the problem's own assumptions. Wait, no, looking back: the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the example, the formatted problem lists assumptions as \"$n$ is an integer, $n$ is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like a mistake. Wait the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But in the example, the formatted problem has assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but that seems incorrect. Wait, perhaps the example is wrong? Or maybe the user in the example had a different original problem. Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n)... is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect. But regardless, following the user's instruction, we need to structure the current problem.\n\nIn this case, the original problem states that there is no continuous mapping from L^1 onto L^∞. The proof provided uses the separability of L^1 and non-separability of L^∞. Therefore, the key assumptions here are:\n\n1. T is a continuous mapping from L^1 to L^∞.\n2. T is surjective.\n3. L^1 is separable.\n4. L^∞ is not separable.\n\nEach of these should be separate lines in the assumption section. The problem is to prove the non-existence, which is the original statement.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- T: L^1([0,1]) → L^∞([0,1]) is a continuous mapping,\n- T is surjective,\n- L^1([0,1]) is separable,\n- L^∞([0,1]) is not separable.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there is no continuous mapping from L^1([0,1]) onto L^∞([0,1]).\n\nThis structure captures all the necessary assumptions and the problem statement. Each assumption is a single property or condition applied to one object (T, L^1, L^∞). The problem is the main statement to be proven.",
