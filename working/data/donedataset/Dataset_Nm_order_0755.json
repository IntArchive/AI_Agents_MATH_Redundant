    "Content": "I came across this amazing fact on Twitter . $$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\log\\left(F_1 \\cdots F_n\\right)}{\\log \\text{LCM}\\left(F_1, \\ldots,  F_n\\right)} = \\frac{\\pi^2}{6}$$ where $F_i$ is the $i$ th Fibonacci number and LCM = Least Common Multiple. This is such an interesting link between the Fibonacci numbers (which are closely linked to the Golden Ratio $\\varphi$ ) and $\\pi$ . I'm trying to prove why this is the case. I know that, for the numerator, it'll become something like \\begin{align}\n\\log\\left(F_1 \\cdots F_n\\right) &\\sim \\log\\left(\\varphi^1 \\cdots \\varphi^n\\right) \\\\\n&\\sim \\frac{\\log \\varphi}{2} n^2\n\\end{align} Reverse engineering, that tells me that the denominator will turn out to be the same, but with an extra factor of $\\frac{6}{\\pi^2}$ . What I'm wondering is, how to prove that this will be the case? Some relevant tools might be that $$\\prod_i \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p_i^2}\\right) = \\frac{6}{\\pi^2}$$ , where $p_i$ is the $i$ th prime. Also, it's not hard to show that the LCM of the first $n$ natural numbers is roughly $e^n$ . Finally, the probability that the $n$ th Fibonacci is prime is roughly $\\sim\\frac{\\log\\varphi}{n}$ I think (though I'm not actually sure if this has been proven). As an aside, even though it's cool that this is done with the Fibonacci sequence, judging by how the $\\varphi$ factor just cleanly cancels on top and bottom, I have a feeling that this fact might be true for other linear integer recurrence relations that have an exploding dominant eigenvalue.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "A full proof of this fact can be found in the paper A new Formula for $\\pi$ by Yuri V. Matiyasevich  and Richard K. Guy. A brief summary: Notations I will use: Let $\\mu$ denote the Möbius function , let $w_n:=\\operatorname{LCM}(F_1,F_2,\\dots,F_n)$ . As you noticed, we have (for large $n$ ) \\begin{equation}\\tag 1\\label 1\n\\log(F_1\\cdots F_n)\\sim \\frac{n^2 \\ln\\tau}{2},\n\\end{equation} where $\\tau=\\frac{1+\\sqrt 5}{2}$ denotes the golden ratio. So proving your statement is equivalent to proving that (for large $m$ ) \\begin{equation}\\tag 2\\label 2\n\\ln w_m \\sim 3\\ln(\\tau)\\frac{m^2}{\\pi^2}.\n\\end{equation} In the paper, \\eqref{2} is called Chebyshev's form of the prime number theorem for Fibonacci numbers . By rather lengthy applications of results on Arithmetic functions and the Möbius inversion formula , one gets \\begin{equation}\\tag 3\\label 3\\begin{split}\n\\ln w_m &= \\sum_{d=1}^m \\sum_{i \\text{ such that } i | d} \\mu\\left(\\frac di\\right)\\ln F_i \\\\\n&= B(m)+\\sum_{d=1}^m  \\sum_{i \\text{ such that } i | d} \\mu\\left(\\frac di\\right) i \\ln\\tau,\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation} where $0\\le B(m)< 2m^\\frac32$ . One can write (by elementary results on Euler's totient function $\\phi$ ) \\begin{equation}\\tag 4\\label 4\n\\sum_{d=1}^m  \\sum_{i \\text{ such that } i | d} \\mu\\left(\\frac di\\right) i \\ln\\tau\n= \\ln\\tau\\cdot\\sum_{d=1}^m \\phi(d)\\sim 3\\ln(\\tau)\\frac{m^2}{\\pi^2}\n\\end{equation} (the last similarity is a proven result from number Theory.) So, as a result, $$\\ln w_m \\sim 3\\ln(\\tau)\\frac{m^2}{\\pi^2} + B(m),$$ where $0\\le B(m)< 2m^\\frac32$ . From this follows \\eqref{2} and thus also your result.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to read the original problem carefully and extract the assumptions and the main problem statement.\n\nThe original problem is about proving that the ratio of the logarithm of the product of Fibonacci numbers to the logarithm of their least common multiple converges to π²/6 as n approaches infinity. The user provided some context, like the approximation of the numerator and the product formula involving primes related to 6/π². They also mentioned tools like the LCM of natural numbers being roughly eⁿ and the probability of Fibonacci numbers being prime.\n\nMy task is to filter out unrelated information and structure the problem. Let's start by listing assumptions. Each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nLooking at the problem:\n\n- The Fibonacci numbers are denoted as F_i. So, the first assumption is that F_i is the i-th Fibonacci number.\n- The limit is as n approaches infinity. So, another assumption is n approaches infinity.\n- The problem involves LCM of F_1 to F_n. Maybe the LCM is considered over these terms.\n- The user mentioned that the numerator (product of F_i) can be approximated using φ. However, the problem statement itself doesn't assume this; that's part of their approach. So perhaps that's not an assumption but part of their reasoning.\n- The relevant formula involving the product over primes (1 - 1/p_i²) = 6/π² is a known result, so maybe that's not an assumption here but a tool they might use.\n- The user also mentions that LCM of first n natural numbers is roughly eⁿ, but again, that's a tool, not an assumption of the problem.\n\nThe core problem is to prove the limit statement. The assumptions would be the definitions involved. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n- F_i is the i-th Fibonacci number.\n- The logarithm is applied to the product F_1⋯F_n.\n- The logarithm is applied to the LCM of F_1,…,F_n.\n- The limit is taken as n approaches infinity.\n\nWait, but the problem as stated doesn't have explicit conditions on F_i other than being Fibonacci numbers. The problem is to prove the limit equals π²/6. Are there any hidden assumptions? For example, the user mentions that the ratio converges, so maybe the assumption is that the limit exists, but I think in the problem statement, the task is to prove the limit exists and equals that value. So perhaps the problem is as stated without additional assumptions beyond the definitions of Fibonacci numbers and LCM.\n\nTherefore, structuring the problem:\n\nAssumption:\nF_i is the i-th Fibonacci number,\nThe logarithm function is used,\nThe least common multiple (LCM) is considered for F_1,…,F_n,\nThe limit is taken as n approaches infinity.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\log\\left(F_1 \\cdots F_n\\right)}{\\log \\text{LCM}\\left(F_1, \\ldots,  F_n\\right)} = \\frac{\\pi^2}{6}$$\n\nThat should capture the problem. The other information in the question, like approximations using φ or product over primes, are part of the user's thoughts, not assumptions of the problem itself. The example given in the user's instruction had assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", but in this case, the problem's assumptions are more about definitions and the setup rather than specific conditions. Hence, the structured problem should list those basic setup steps as assumptions.",
