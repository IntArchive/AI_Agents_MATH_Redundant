    "Content": "For $x,y\\in \\mathbb R^n$ define \n$$d(x,y)={\\|x-y\\| \\over \\sqrt{1+\\|x\\|^2} \\sqrt{1+\\|y\\|^2}}$$\nHere $\\|x\\|$ is the euclidean norm of a vector. How to prove that $d$ (the spherical metric) is indeed a metric? Progress so far: $d(x,y)\\ge 0$ is obvious. $d(x,y) =0 \\iff \\|x-y\\|=0 \\iff x=y$, so the positivity holds. $d(x,y) = d(y,x)$ is clear from the formula, so symmetry holds. But I am having difficulties with the triangle inequality. Writing it out in coordinates leads to a complicated inequality with square roots all over the place in denominators. Is there a better way?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The quickest way I know is to \"cheat\"${}^*$ with Stereographic projection . Introduce the map $F:\\mathbb R^n\\to\\mathbb R^{n+1}$ defined by $F(  x)=( z,t)\\in\\mathbb R^n\\times \\mathbb R$ with \n$$  z=\\frac{x}{1+\\|x\\|^2},\\quad t= \\frac{\\|x\\|^2}{1+\\|x\\|^2}$$\n(This is a projection onto the sphere $\\|z\\|^2+(t-1/2)^2=1/4$, but this fact isn't needed.)\nDirect computation shows that \n$$\n\\|F(x)-F(y)\\|^2  = \\frac{\\|x\\|^2}{(1+\\|x\\|^2)^2}+\\frac{\\|y\\|^2}{(1+\\|y\\|^2)^2} - \\frac{2x\\cdot y}{(1+\\|x\\|^2)(1+\\|y\\|^2)} + \\frac{1}{(1+\\|x\\|^2)^2}+\\frac{1}{(1+\\|y\\|^2)^2} - \\frac{2}{(1+\\|x\\|^2)(1+\\|y\\|^2)}$$\nwhich simplifies to\n$$\n\\frac{1}{1+\\|x\\|^2}+\\frac{1}{1+\\|y\\|^2} - \\frac{2x\\cdot y}{(1+\\|x\\|^2)(1+\\|y\\|^2)}  - \\frac{2}{(1+\\|x\\|^2)(1+\\|y\\|^2)}\n$$\nand subsequently to\n$$\n\\frac{2+\\|x\\|^2+\\|y\\|^2-  2x\\cdot y -2}{(1+\\|x\\|^2)(1+\\|y\\|^2)}  = {\\|x-y\\|^2 \\over ( 1+\\|x\\|^2)\\,(1+\\|y\\|^2)}\n$$\nThus, $\\|F(x)-F(y)\\|=d(x,y)$, and the triangle inequality for $d$ follows from the triangle inequality for the Euclidean distance in $\\mathbb R^{n+1}$. $(*)$ I think this is not much cheating, because what use is this metric to us without knowing its relation to the sphere?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to format the given Math Stack Exchange question according to the specified structure. Let me start by reading the problem carefully.\n\nThe user is asking how to prove that the spherical metric d(x,y) satisfies the triangle inequality. The problem defines d(x,y) as the Euclidean norm of x minus y divided by the product of the square roots of (1 plus the squared Euclidean norms of x and y). They already verified non-negativity, definiteness, and symmetry but are stuck on the triangle inequality.\n\nFirst, I need to list all assumptions. The original problem mentions that x and y are in R^n, so that's one assumption. The metric is defined using the Euclidean norm, so maybe another assumption is that the Euclidean norm is used. Also, since they want to verify the triangle inequality, the key properties to consider are those that make d a metric, but the assumptions should be about the problem's conditions, not what needs to be proven.\n\nWait, the problem's definition of d(x,y) is given. So the assumptions are the structure of d(x,y). Let's parse that:\n\n1. The domain of d is R^n x R^n (since x and y are in R^n).\n2. The Euclidean norm is used in the definition.\n3. The denominator is sqrt(1 + ||x||^2) times sqrt(1 + ||y||^2).\n\nEach assumption should be a single property applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nx and y are elements of R^n,\nd(x,y) is defined using the Euclidean norm,\nthe denominator of d(x,y) is sqrt(1 + ||x||^2) multiplied by sqrt(1 + ||y||^2).\n\nWait, but maybe \"the denominator...\" can be split into two separate assumptions? Each part of the denominator is sqrt(1 + ||x||^2) and sqrt(1 + ||y||^2). But since they're multiplied, maybe it's one assumption about the denominator's form. Alternatively, each sqrt term is a separate assumption. Hmm, the example given in the user's instruction had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Each is a separate condition on n. So here, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nx and y are vectors in R^n,\nd(x,y) is defined as ||x - y|| divided by (sqrt(1 + ||x||^2) * sqrt(1 + ||y||^2)).\n\nBut the example had separate lines for each assumption. Wait, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. Wait, but in the example, the user's formatted problem included an extra assumption (divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal problem in example says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption includes \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the example? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which is not in the original. That might be an error. Alternatively, perhaps the example is showing how to structure even if the original problem had multiple assumptions.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user's original question doesn't have any extra assumptions beyond the definition of d(x,y). So the assumptions here would be about the structure of d(x,y). Let me check the user's example again. The original example problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, and the formatted assumptions were \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect unless the original problem had a condition that n is divisible by 7. But the original says \"for every integer n\", so maybe the example was wrong. But maybe the user intended to show that sometimes assumptions are split even if they are in the original problem's statement. Hmm.\n\nIn any case, for the current problem, the user is defining d(x,y) with that formula. The key assumptions are:\n\n- x and y are in R^n.\n\n- The metric d is defined as ||x - y|| divided by the product sqrt(1 + ||x||^2) * sqrt(1 + ||y||^2).\n\nSo perhaps two assumptions: one about the domain (x, y in R^n), and another about the definition of d(x,y).\n\nBut maybe splitting the denominator into two separate terms as parts of the definition. Alternatively, since the denominator is a product, maybe it's considered as a single component. But according to the example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nx and y are elements of R^n,\nd(x,y) is defined using the Euclidean norm of (x - y),\nthe denominator of d(x,y) is the product of sqrt(1 + ||x||^2) and sqrt(1 + ||y||^2).\n\nBut maybe each part is considered separate. Alternatively, the definition of d(x,y) as given is a single assumption. However, in the example, the user split the original problem's conditions into two assumptions (n is integer, n divisible by 7), even though the original problem didn't have the divisibility by 7. Wait, perhaps there was a mistake in the example. Let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal problem in the example: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that seems incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should just be that n is an integer. The divisibility by 7 is not part of the original problem. But the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems like an error. Unless maybe the original problem had a typo and was supposed to have n divisible by 7, but the user presented a wrong example.\n\nIn any case, perhaps the example's formatted problem is incorrect, but the user wants us to follow that format. So maybe when there are multiple conditions in the original problem, we list them each as separate assumptions. For the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\n1. x and y are in R^n.\n\n2. The spherical metric d(x,y) is defined as ||x - y|| divided by [sqrt(1 + ||x||^2) * sqrt(1 + ||y||^2)].\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user mentions \"the spherical metric\", so maybe another assumption is that d is called the spherical metric. However, that's just nomenclature, not a mathematical condition. The key assumptions are the domain and the definition of d.\n\nSo structuring the assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\nx and y are vectors in R^n,\nd(x,y) is defined as ||x - y|| divided by the product of sqrt(1 + ||x||^2) and sqrt(1 + ||y||^2).\n\nAlternatively, split the denominator into two parts:\n\nAssumption:\nx and y are vectors in R^n,\nthe numerator of d(x,y) is the Euclidean distance between x and y,\nthe denominator of d(x,y) is sqrt(1 + ||x||^2) multiplied by sqrt(1 + ||y||^2).\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should be on one line. So perhaps each component of the definition. But the example seems to have two assumptions even if they are related. Maybe in this case, the definition of d(x,y) is one assumption. But the example split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate, even though the original problem had \"for every integer n\". So perhaps for the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nx and y are elements of R^n,\nd(x,y) = ||x - y|| / (sqrt(1 + ||x||^2) * sqrt(1 + ||y||^2)).\n\nThen the problem is to prove that d satisfies the triangle inequality, hence being a metric.\n\nThe user already confirmed positivity, definiteness, and symmetry, so the problem is specifically about the triangle inequality. But the original question's title is \"How to show that the spherical metric satisfies the triangle inequality?\" and the problem statement says \"how to prove that d (the spherical metric) is indeed a metric?\" So the problem is to prove d is a metric, but the user has already handled some parts and needs help with the triangle inequality. However, the task is to structure the problem as per the user's format, which includes stating the problem as per the original question. So maybe the problem is to prove that d is a metric, with the specific focus on the triangle inequality.\n\nBut in the example, the problem was stated as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" So perhaps here the problem is \"Prove that d is a metric,\" but the user is focusing on the triangle inequality part. However, the user's instruction says to structure the problem as per the original question. The original question's problem is to prove that d is indeed a metric, but the user's progress is stuck on the triangle inequality. But the formatted problem should capture the original problem, which is to prove d is a metric. However, the example's formatted problem kept the original problem statement, even though the user had made progress on parts of it. So perhaps the problem statement remains \"Prove that d is indeed a metric,\" even though the user is asking specifically about the triangle inequality. Alternatively, the problem could be \"Prove that d satisfies the triangle inequality,\" but the original question's title is about the triangle inequality, but the problem statement is \"how to prove that d is indeed a metric?\" So the problem is to prove d is a metric, but the user needs help with the triangle inequality part.\n\nBut according to the user's example, they kept the problem statement as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91,\" even though the original problem had \"for every integer n,\" which might have been split into assumptions. So following that example, the formatted problem here would be \"Prove that d is indeed a metric,\" even though the user is stuck on the triangle inequality. The Problem line should capture the original problem's main question.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nx and y are elements of R^n,\nd(x,y) is defined as ||x - y|| divided by [sqrt(1 + ||x||^2) * sqrt(1 + ||y||^2)].\n\nProblem:\nProve that d (the spherical metric) is indeed a metric.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be more specific, like \"Prove that d satisfies the triangle inequality,\" but the original question's main problem is proving d is a metric. The user is asking for help with the triangle inequality part, but the formatted problem should state the original problem as is. So the Problem line should be \"Prove that d is indeed a metric.\"\n\nBut in the example, even though the user had progress on some parts, the problem statement remained the original. So yes, the problem is to prove d is a metric. Therefore, the formatted problem should reflect that.",
