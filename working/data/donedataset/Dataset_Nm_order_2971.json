    "AcceptedAnswer": "For $k<e^{c\\sqrt{\\log x}}$ , you can prove the above using partial summation along with the prime number theorem, but it is provably false for $k\\sim x^{u}$ when we assume RH.  For a complete solution, take a look at this past answer. Specifically, I prove that $$\\sum_{p\\leq x}p^{k}=\\text{li}\\left(x^{k+1}\\right)+O\\left(x^{k+1}E(x)\\right),$$ where $\\text{li}(x)=\\int_2^x \\frac{1}{\\log t}dt$ is the logarithmic integral, and where $E(x)$ is any positive increasing function which bounds the error term $\\pi(x)-\\text{li}(x)$ .  This gives the asymptotic $$\\sum_{p\\leq x}p^{k}\\sim \\frac{x^{k+1}}{(k+1)\\log x}$$ uniformely for all $k<e^{c\\sqrt{\\log x}}$ , and if you use the Walfisz bound it can be taken slightly further to $e^{c(\\log x)^{3/5}}$ with some doubly logarithmic terms in the exponent. If you assume the Riemann Hypothesis, this shows that your above expressions is not correct for $k\\approx x^u$ where $0<u<1$ .  On RH we have that $E(x)\\ll x^{\\frac{1}{2}+\\epsilon}$ , and so the asymptotic holds for all $k<x^{\\frac{1}{2}-\\epsilon}$ .  Then for $k=x^u$ we have $\\log x-\\log k=(1-u)\\log x$ , which yields the asymptotic $$(1-u)\\frac{x^{k+1}}{(k+1)},$$ which is off by the constant factor $(1-u)$ . There may be a simpler way to prove that your expression is incorrect for $k\\sim x^u$ that does not require RH.  I think you need to be clever though. Hope that helps,",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the user's format. First, I need to parse the original question from Math Stack Exchange. The title is \"how to prove this extended prime number theorem?\" and the question presents a conjecture about a sum of primes raised to a power.\n\nThe user wants me to list all assumptions line by line, each addressing only one property or condition applied to one object. Then state the problem concisely. Let me look at the example provided. The example shows assumptions like \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". Then the problem is restated.\n\nIn the given problem, the conjecture states that for positive integers n and k with n - 50 > k² > 0 and n sufficiently large, when p is the biggest odd prime ≤ n, the sum 3^k +5^k +7^k +…+p^k is asymptotic to n^{k+1}/[(k+1)(log n - log k)].\n\nSo, the assumptions here are:\n\n1. n and k are positive integers.\n2. The inequality n - 50 > k² > 0 holds.\n3. n is sufficiently large (but \"sufficiently large\" is a bit vague; perhaps we need to include it as an assumption).\n4. p is the biggest odd prime less than or equal to n.\n\nEach of these should be separate lines in the assumptions. The problem is to prove the asymptotic equivalence given these conditions.\n\nWait, the original problem mentions \"when p is the biggest odd prime ≤ n\". So p is defined as that. So the assumptions should include that p is the largest odd prime ≤ n. Also, the inequality n -50 > k² >0. And n and k are positive integers, n sufficiently large.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is a single line, each about one object or condition. Let me check:\n\nAssumption 1: n and k are positive integers. Wait, the example has \"n is an integer\" as a single line. But here, both n and k are positive integers. Should I split them? The example has \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate. But here, \"n and k are positive integers\" is one condition. However, according to the instruction, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps split into two: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer. But maybe the original problem states them together. Let me check the original problem's wording: \"Let $n$ and $k$ be positive integers with $n - 50 > k^2 > 0$...\". So the user might have combined n and k as positive integers. But according to the example, each assumption is a separate line. So maybe split into two assumptions: 1. n is a positive integer. 2. k is a positive integer. Then the next assumption: n -50 > k². Then k² >0. Then n is sufficiently large. Then p is the largest odd prime ≤n.\n\nBut \"k is a positive integer\" and \"k² >0\" are related. Since k is a positive integer, k² is automatically positive. But the problem states \"n -50 > k² >0\". So perhaps the inequality is n -50 > k² and k² >0. But since k is a positive integer, k² >0 is redundant. However, the problem includes it as part of the condition. So maybe the user wants to include both parts of the inequality. So assumptions:\n\n1. n is a positive integer.\n2. k is a positive integer.\n3. n - 50 > k².\n4. k² > 0.\n5. n is sufficiently large.\n6. p is the largest odd prime less than or equal to n.\n\nBut wait, \"k is a positive integer\" already implies k² >0. So perhaps the problem's original statement includes both n -50 >k² and k²>0 as explicit conditions. So even though k is positive, they still write k² >0. So maybe the user wants to include both. So I should list all the given conditions as separate assumptions. Similarly, \"n is sufficiently large\" is an assumption, even though it's vague.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n1. n is a positive integer.\n2. k is a positive integer.\n3. n - 50 > k².\n4. k² > 0.\n5. n is sufficiently large.\n6. p is the largest odd prime less than or equal to n.\n\nEach on its own line. Then the problem is to prove that the sum 3^k +5^k +7^k +…+p^k is asymptotic to n^{k+1}/[(k+1)(log n - log k)].\n\nI need to check if I missed any conditions. The original problem says \"for the odd primes we have, when p is the biggest odd prime ≤n\". So the sum starts at 3^k (the first odd prime after 2) up to p. So maybe an assumption that the primes considered are odd primes. But since p is the largest odd prime ≤n, and the sum starts at 3, which is the next odd prime after 2, perhaps that's inherent in the definition of the sum. So maybe no need to add an assumption about primes being odd, since p is defined as the largest odd prime. So the sum is over odd primes from 3 up to p. But the problem statement mentions \"for the odd primes\", so maybe the user wants to consider only odd primes. So perhaps add an assumption that the primes in the sum are odd primes. But wait, the problem states \"for the odd primes we have, when p is the biggest odd prime ≤n\", so the sum is over odd primes from 3 to p. So maybe the assumption is that the primes in the sum are odd primes. But in the problem statement, it's part of the problem's phrasing. So perhaps the assumption is already covered by the definition of p. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to specify that the sum is over odd primes. However, given the example, where the assumptions are listed as properties of the objects (n is integer, etc.), perhaps here the key assumptions are about n, k, and p. The fact that the sum is over odd primes is part of the problem statement. So in the problem part, we can write \"Prove that the sum of odd primes 3^k +5^k +7^k +…+p^k…\".\n\nBut according to the user's example, the problem part is taken verbatim from the original, except with some conditions moved to assumptions. So in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", which was moved to assumptions, leaving the problem part as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\".\n\nIn this case, the original problem says \"A Generalized Prime Number Theorem? Conjecture Let n and k be positive integers with n -50 >k²>0 and n sufficiently large. Then for the odd primes we have, when p is the biggest odd prime ≤n, [sum] ~ ...\"\n\nSo the user structures the problem by moving the conditions into assumptions. So in the formatted problem, the assumptions would include n and k are positive integers, n -50 >k²>0, n sufficiently large, p is the biggest odd prime ≤n, and the problem part is the asymptotic equivalence.\n\nBut the original problem includes \"for the odd primes we have\", which is part of the problem statement. So in the problem part, it would be \"Prove that for the odd primes, the sum ... ~ ...\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"for the odd primes\" is part of the conclusion, so it's part of what needs to be proved. Therefore, the problem part would include that.\n\nBut the key is to move all the conditions into assumptions. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n- n is a positive integer.\n- k is a positive integer.\n- n -50 > k².\n- k² > 0.\n- n is sufficiently large.\n- p is the largest odd prime less than or equal to n.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$3^k + 5^k + 7^k + 11^k + \\dots + p^k \\sim \\frac{n^{k+1}}{(k+1) ( \\log(n) - \\log(k) )}$$ for the odd primes.\n\nWait, but in the original problem statement, the asymptotic equivalence is stated as a conjecture when those conditions hold. So the problem is to prove that under the given assumptions, the sum is asymptotic to that expression.\n\nSo putting it all together, the formatted problem would have the assumptions listed as above, and the problem statement is to prove the asymptotic equivalence.\n\nNow, checking the example again: the original problem had \"for every integer n\", which became an assumption \"n is an integer\", and \"n divisible by 7\" as another assumption. The problem part was to prove divisibility by 91.\n\nIn this case, the original problem's conditions are \"n and k positive integers with n -50 >k² >0 and n sufficiently large. Then for the odd primes we have, when p is the biggest odd prime ≤n, [sum] ~ ...\".\n\nSo translating into assumptions:\n\nEach condition separated:\n\n1. n is a positive integer.\n2. k is a positive integer.\n3. n - 50 > k².\n4. k² > 0.\n5. n is sufficiently large.\n6. p is the largest odd prime ≤n.\n\nBut note that in the original problem, the inequality is written as n -50 >k² >0, which combines two inequalities. However, according to the user's example, each assumption should address only one property. So splitting into two:\n\n3. n -50 > k².\n4. k² >0.\n\nBut since k is a positive integer, k² >0 is redundant. However, the problem includes it, so we should list it as an assumption.\n\nThus, the assumptions are as listed.\n\nThen, the problem is to prove the asymptotic equivalence for the sum of k-th powers of odd primes from 3 up to p.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have those assumptions and the problem as stated.",
