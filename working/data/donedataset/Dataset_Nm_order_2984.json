    "Content": "I had this \"almost bonus\" question on the final in Group Theory recently: prove that there is no such group $G$ which would satisfy ${\\rm Aut}(G)\\cong \\mathbb{Z}_n$ , where $n$ is an odd integer. I don't have much certainty if this proof is OK, and one's opinion would be appreciated. Here's my attempt: Suppose that there exists such a group $G$ that satisfies the above condition. Since $\\mathbb{Z}_n$ is cyclic, ${\\rm Aut}(G)$ is also cyclic and $G$ is abelian, which implies that ${\\rm Inn}(G)\\cong \\{e\\}$ . Thus ${\\rm Aut}(G)={\\rm Out}(G)$ . (I don't think this fact is important here though) . Now, since an automorphism sends a generator to a generator, and since each automorphism is completely determined by such mapping, $|{\\rm Aut}(G)|$ must be of factorial order. But an integer factorial is always even. However, $|\\mathbb{Z}_n|$ is odd, which is a contradiction. Therefore, no such $G$ exists. I'm afraid that my proof is not very nice, but at least a genuine attempt was made.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "$\\DeclareMathOperator{\\Aut}{Aut}$\nWe'll show the slightly stronger result that $|\\Aut(G)| \\not= 2n+1$ for any $n \\ge 1$ EDIT: Provided $G$ is abelian: see the comments . If $\\Aut(G)$ is trivial, then there is nothing to show.  Suppose, then, that $G$ has a nontrivial automorphism group.  We will show that $|\\Aut(G)|$ is even by explicitly exhibiting an automorphism $\\phi$ of $G$ having order $2$ for any group $G$. It will then follow by Lagrange's theorem that $\\Aut(G)$ has even order. If $G$ has an element of order at least $3$, then $\\phi:x \\to x^{-1}$ is the desired automorphism of even order.  It only remains to consider the case where $G$ contains only elements of order less than or equal to $2$.  In that case, we must have that $G$ is a vector space over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ (see Group where every element is order 2 for a proof of this result).  If $G$ is one dimensional as a vector space, then $\\Aut(G) = \\Aut(\\mathbb{Z}_2)$ is trivial, so there is nothing more to show.  For $G$ having dimension greater than $1$, we have that $\\Aut(G) \\cong \\operatorname{GL}(G)$, so if we pick an ordered basis for $G$, then the automorphism which interchanges the first and second basis vectors (and fixes all others) is an order $2$ automorphism.  (This argument, which Slade gave in the comments, applies even to infinite $G$, while my previous argument tacitly assumed $G$ was finite.)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this problem. The user wants to show that there's no group G such that Aut(G) is isomorphic to Z_n when n is odd. \n\nFirst, let's look at the original question. The user presented their proof, but they're unsure if it's correct. Let me extract the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe problem is to prove non-existence of a group G with Aut(G) ≅ ℤₙ for odd n. The assumptions here are that G is a group, Aut(G) is cyclic (since ℤₙ is cyclic), and n is odd. But wait, the problem states \"for odd n\", so the main assumption is that n is an odd integer, and we need to show no such G exists with Aut(G) ≅ ℤₙ. \n\nThe user's proof starts by assuming such G exists. Then they note Aut(G) is cyclic, hence G is abelian (since if Inn(G) is cyclic and Aut(G) is cyclic, maybe G is abelian? Wait, Inn(G) is G/Z(G), and if G is abelian, then Inn(G) is trivial. So the user says Aut(G) is cyclic implies G is abelian, leading to Inn(G) ≅ {e}, hence Aut(G) = Out(G). But the user mentions this might not be important. Then they argue that |Aut(G)| must be factorial order, but factorial is even, while |ℤₙ| is odd, leading to contradiction.\n\nHmm, but does the automorphism group of a group always have factorial order? That seems too general. For example, if G is cyclic of prime order p, Aut(G) is cyclic of order p-1. Which isn't factorial unless p-1 is factorial. So maybe the user is thinking of automorphism groups of cyclic groups, but even then, their argument might be flawed. But that's the user's attempt, not part of the problem itself.\n\nThe actual problem is just to show that there's no group G with Aut(G) ≅ ℤₙ for odd n. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- G is a group.\n- Aut(G) is isomorphic to ℤₙ (which is cyclic of order n).\n- n is an odd integer.\n\nBut perhaps more precise. Wait, the problem states \"for odd n\", so the key assumptions are that n is odd and Aut(G) is cyclic (as ℤₙ is cyclic). The problem is to show no such G exists. So structuring the problem:\n\nAssumption: \n- G is a group,\n- Aut(G) is cyclic,\n- The order of Aut(G) is odd.\n\nProblem: Prove that there does not exist a group G such that Aut(G) is isomorphic to ℤₙ where n is odd.\n\nWait, but the user's original problem statement says \"for odd n\". So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- G is a group,\n- Aut(G) ≅ ℤₙ where n is odd.\n\nBut the key is to extract from the problem the necessary assumptions. The problem is to prove non-existence, so the problem statement is: There does not exist a group G such that Aut(G) ≅ ℤₙ for odd n. The user's attempt made some steps, but the problem itself is as stated. So the formatted version should list the assumptions (if any) given in the problem. Wait, the problem as stated is: \"prove that there is no such group G which would satisfy Aut(G) ≅ ℤₙ, where n is an odd integer.\" So there are no explicit assumptions on G other than it being a group, and Aut(G) being isomorphic to an odd cyclic group. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- G is a group,\n- Aut(G) is isomorphic to ℤₙ,\n- n is an odd integer.\n\nBut in the example provided, the assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So here, similarly, the problem is for any odd n. Wait, but in the example, the original problem had the assumption that n is an integer (since the problem says \"for every integer n\"), but in the formatted version, they added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, perhaps the example was a different problem. Let me check.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem had assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, but that seems incorrect because the original problem was for every integer n, not just those divisible by 7. Maybe the example was modified. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. Alternatively, maybe the example was for a different problem. Hmm. Regardless, the task here is to structure the given problem (about Aut(G) ≅ ℤₙ) into the Assumption and Problem sections as per the example.\n\nIn the example, they listed the assumptions as separate bullet points. For the current problem, the original problem states that n is an odd integer. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- G is a group,\n- Aut(G) is isomorphic to ℤₙ,\n- n is an odd integer.\n\nBut the problem is to show that such G does not exist. So the formatted problem should list these assumptions and then the problem statement.\n\nSo following the example, the answer should be:\n\nAssumption:\n- G is a group,\n- Aut(G) is isomorphic to ℤₙ,\n- n is an odd integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there does not exist a group G such that Aut(G) ≅ ℤₙ.\n\nWait, but the problem already states \"for odd n\". So maybe the problem statement in the formatted version should include the condition on n. Let me see the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem listed the assumptions as n is an integer, n divisible by 7, and the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. Wait, but 91 is 7×13, so maybe the original problem had a different setup. But perhaps the example was not perfect. Anyway, for the current problem, the key is to structure the problem as given, with the necessary assumptions.\n\nThe original problem is to prove that there does not exist a group G with Aut(G) ≅ ℤₙ when n is odd. So the assumptions are that n is odd and Aut(G) ≅ ℤₙ. The group G is part of the problem statement. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- G is a group,\n- Aut(G) is cyclic,\n- The order of Aut(G) is odd.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there does not exist a group G such that Aut(G) ≅ ℤₙ for odd n.\n\nAlternatively, since ℤₙ has order n, which is odd, maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n- G is a group,\n- Aut(G) is isomorphic to ℤₙ where n is odd.\n\nProblem:\nProve that no such group G exists.\n\nBut the example had assumptions split into single conditions. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- G is a group,\n- Aut(G) is cyclic,\n- The order of Aut(G) is odd.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there does not exist a group G such that Aut(G) ≅ ℤₙ for odd n.\n\nWait, but ℤₙ being cyclic and of odd order implies Aut(G) is cyclic and of odd order. So maybe the problem can be structured as:\n\nAssumption:\n- G is a group,\n- Aut(G) is cyclic of odd order.\n\nProblem:\nProve that no such group G exists.\n\nBut the original problem mentions ℤₙ explicitly. So to mirror the example, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- G is a group,\n- Aut(G) ≅ ℤₙ,\n- n is an odd integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that such a group G does not exist.\n\nThat seems to align with the example given. Each assumption is a single condition. So \"Aut(G) ≅ ℤₙ\" is one assumption, \"n is an odd integer\" is another. And the problem is to prove non-existence.",
