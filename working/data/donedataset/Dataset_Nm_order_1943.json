    "Content": "Let $\\|A\\|_1=\\operatorname{trace}(\\sqrt{A^* A})$. I already proved that for arbitrary unitary matrices $U$ and $V$, $\\|UAV^*\\|_1=\\|A\\|_1$ and $\\|A\\|_1=\\sigma_1+\\dots+\\sigma_k$. Now I would like to prove that $\\|A\\|_1$ defines a matrix norm, $A\\in M_{m\\times n}\\mathbb (C)$. 1) $\\|A\\|_1=0\\Leftrightarrow A=0$. I already proved that. 2) $\\|\\lambda A\\|_1=|\\lambda|\\|A\\|_1$.This also. 3) $|\\operatorname{trace}(A)|\\leqslant \\|A\\|_1$. I am not sure, my idea is to use $A=U\\Sigma V^*$. 4) $\\|BA\\|_1\\leqslant \\|B\\|\\|A\\|_1$ for $B\\in M_{l\\times m}\\mathbb (C)$ and $\\|B\\|=\\sup\\frac{\\|Bx\\|}{\\|x\\|}=\\max\\{\\sigma_1,\\dots,\\sigma_k\\}$. My idea is again using singular value decomposition for $A$ and a polar decomposition for $BA$. 5)$\\|A\\|_1=\\sup_{\\|B\\|\\leqslant 1}|\\operatorname{trace}(BA)|$ with $B\\in M_{n\\times m}\\mathbb (C)$ and $A\\in M_{m\\times n}\\mathbb (C)$ Here I have no idea. 6) $\\|A+A'\\|_1\\leqslant\\|A\\|_1+\\|A'\\|_1$ with $A,A'\\in M_{m\\times n}\\mathbb (C)$ This can be followed from 5). If you could help me with 3)-5) I would really appreciate it.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here are some (edit: more) ideas: First, it seems useful to restrict oneself to square matrices by \"squaring\" A as in this reference (p. 2 bottom of http://www.drhea.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/vonNeumann.pdf - just add zeros to $A$ to make it square which does not affect the SVD except some diagonal ones to $U$ or $V$ and some zeros to $\\Sigma$ ). (I think this should anyway only hold if $A \\in M_{n\\times n}(\\mathbb{C})$ is a square matrix.) In that case, I believe you can prove this by considering $$\\mathrm{tr}(A) = \\mathrm{tr}(U\\Sigma V^*) = \\mathrm{tr}(\\Sigma V^*U) = \\sum_i(\\Sigma e_i)\\cdot(V^*U e_i) \\le \\sum_i \\| \\Sigma e_i \\| \\| V^*U e_i \\|\\\\ \\le \\sum_i \\sigma_i.$$ (Note $U,V,\\Sigma$ are all square now.) First of all, let us assume von Neumann's trace inequality ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%27s_trace_inequality ). This inequality implies $|\\mathrm{tr}(BA)| \\le \\|B\\| \\|A\\|_1$ , i.e.\\ $\\sup_{\\|B\\|\\le 1} |\\mathrm{tr}(BA)| \\le \\|B\\| \\|A\\|_1$ . The other direction follows with the choice $B=VU^*$ , where $U,V$ unitary are such that $A=U\\Sigma V^*$ , i.e. $\\sqrt{A^*A} = V \\Sigma V^*$ , because then $\\mathrm{tr}(BA) = \\mathrm{tr}(VU^* U\\Sigma V^*) = \\mathrm{tr}(V\\Sigma V^*) = \\|A\\|_1$ . The statement $|\\mathrm{tr}(AB)|\\le ||B||\\cdot |\\mathrm{tr}(A)|$ is untrue in general, consider the matrix $A=B=\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1\\\\ 1 & 0\\\\ \\end{bmatrix}$ . $|\\mathrm{tr}(AB)|=2$ while $|\\mathrm{tr}(A)| = 0$ . Now we deduce 4) from 5) and von Neumann's trace inequality: $\\|BA\\|_1 = \\sup_{\\|C\\|\\le 1}|\\mathrm{tr}(CBA)| \\le \\sup_{\\|C\\|\\le 1}|\\|B\\|\\mathrm{tr}(CA)| = |\\|B\\| \\|A\\|_1$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this Math Stack Exchange question properly. The user is asking about proving various properties of the trace norm, which is defined as ||A||₁ = trace(√(A*A)). They mentioned they already proved some parts and need help with others. Let me break down each part to structure the problem correctly.\n\nFirst, the main problem is to prove that the trace norm ||A||₁ is a matrix norm. The user lists six properties that need to be verified. However, they have already proved 1) and 2), and need assistance with 3), 4), 5), and 6), though they mention that 6) can follow from 5). But according to the instructions, I need to present the problem in the specified format, listing assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the original question, the assumptions would include the definition of the trace norm, the properties already established (like invariance under unitary transformations, and the expression in terms of singular values), and the conditions given in each subproblem. Each assumption should be a single property applied to one object.\n\nFor example, for part 3), the assumption is that ||A||₁ is the sum of singular values, and the problem is to show |trace(A)| ≤ ||A||₁. Similarly, part 4) assumes B is a linear operator with operator norm defined as the maximum singular value and asks to show ||BA||₁ ≤ ||B|| ||A||₁. Part 5) is about expressing the trace norm as a supremum over certain matrices B. Each of these should be separate parts under the problem statement.\n\nI need to make sure that the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing only one property. For instance, the definition of the trace norm, the unitary invariance, the expression via singular values, the operator norm of B, etc. Each of these is a separate assumption.\n\nLet me list all the necessary assumptions based on the problem:\n\n- The norm ||A||₁ is defined as the trace of √(A*A).\n- For any unitary matrices U and V, ||UAV*||₁ = ||A||₁.\n- ||A||₁ equals the sum of the singular values of A.\n- A is a matrix in M_{m×n}(ℂ).\n- For part 3), the trace of A is considered.\n- For part 4), B is in M_{l×m}(ℂ) and ||B|| is the operator norm (supremum of ||Bx||/||x||, which is the maximum singular value).\n- For part 5), B is in M_{n×m}(ℂ) with ||B|| ≤ 1.\n- For part 6), A and A' are in M_{m×n}(ℂ).\n\nBut the user is focusing on parts 3)-5). However, the problem statement as per the user's request is to structure their problem into the Assumption and Problem sections. The user has provided an example where they extracted the necessary assumptions and the problem. In their case, the problem had an incorrect assumption (n divisible by 7) that was actually not in the original problem. Wait, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, but the user in their example mistakenly included \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which wasn't in the original. So maybe the assistant needs to be careful to extract only the given assumptions from the problem, not add new ones.\n\nIn the current problem, the user is working on the trace norm properties. Let's parse the original question:\n\n- Original assumptions given by the user:\n  - ||A||₁ = trace(√(A*A))\n  - Proved that for unitary U, V, ||UAV*||₁ = ||A||₁\n  - Proved that ||A||₁ = sum of singular values σ₁ + ... + σ_k\n  - A ∈ M_{m×n}(ℂ)\n  - For part 3), they need to show |trace(A)| ≤ ||A||₁\n  - For part 4), B ∈ M_{l×m}(ℂ), ||B|| is operator norm (supremum, which equals max singular value), and need to show ||BA||₁ ≤ ||B|| ||A||₁\n  - For part 5), need to show ||A||₁ = sup_{||B|| ≤1} |trace(BA)| where B ∈ M_{n×m}(ℂ)\n  - Part 6) is triangle inequality, which they think follows from 5)\n\nBut the user is asking to structure the problem according to the format. So the Assumption section should list all the given conditions and properties that are part of the problem's setup. Each assumption is one line, one property applied to one object.\n\nSo for each part of the problem (3,4,5), what are the assumptions?\n\nBut maybe the problem is to structure the entire original question into assumptions and problem. The original problem is to prove that ||A||₁ defines a matrix norm, with the six properties. The user has already done 1 and 2, and needs help with 3-5. However, the task is to structure the problem as per the example, filtering out unrelated info.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem had a mistake in the assumption (n divisible by 7) which wasn't there. But in the current case, the user's problem might have some parts that need to be structured. Let me re-read the user's problem.\n\nThe user says:\n\n\"Let ‖A‖₁= trace(√(A*A)). I already proved that for arbitrary unitary matrices U and V, ‖UAV*‖₁=‖A‖₁ and ‖A‖₁=σ₁+⋯+σ_k. Now I would like to prove that ‖A‖₁ defines a matrix norm, A∈M_{m×n}(ℂ). 1) ‖A‖₁=0 ⇨ A=0. Done. 2) ‖λA‖₁=|λ|‖A‖₁. Done. 3) |trace(A)| ≤ ‖A‖₁. Not sure. 4) ‖BA‖₁ ≤ ‖B‖ ‖A‖₁ for B∈M_{l×m}(ℂ), ‖B‖=sup ‖Bx‖/‖x‖=max{σ₁,…,σ_k}. Idea: use SVD and polar decomposition. 5) ‖A‖₁= sup_{‖B‖≤1} |trace(BA)|. No idea. 6) ‖A+A'‖₁ ≤ ‖A‖₁ + ‖A'‖₁. Can follow from 5). Help with 3)-5).\"\n\nSo the problem is to prove that ‖A‖₁ is a matrix norm by verifying the 6 properties, and the user needs help with 3,4,5. The problem statement as per formatting should have all the assumptions needed for each sub-problem.\n\nBut in the example, the assistant listed assumptions related to the problem. So here, the assumptions would include:\n\n- The definition of ‖A‖₁ as trace(√(A*A))\n- For any unitary U, V, ‖UAV*‖₁ = ‖A‖₁\n- ‖A‖₁ equals the sum of singular values of A\n- A ∈ M_{m×n}(ℂ)\n- For part 3, considering the trace of A\n- For part 4, B ∈ M_{l×m}(ℂ), ‖B‖ is the operator norm (max singular value)\n- For part 5, B ∈ M_{n×m}(ℂ) with ‖B‖ ≤ 1\n\nBut each assumption should be a single line. So let's list them:\n\nAssumption:\n‖A‖₁ is defined as trace of √(A*A),\nFor any unitary matrices U and V, ‖UAV*‖₁ = ‖A‖₁,\n‖A‖₁ is the sum of the singular values of A,\nA is an element of M_{m×n}(ℂ),\nB is an element of M_{l×m}(ℂ),\nThe operator norm ‖B‖ is the supremum of ‖Bx‖/‖x‖ over non-zero x,\nThe operator norm ‖B‖ is equal to the maximum singular value of B,\nB is an element of M_{n×m}(ℂ),\nThe operator norm ‖B‖ is less than or equal to 1.\n\nWait, but the problem statement includes all these parts. However, the user wants to structure the problem, so the assumptions should be the given conditions, and the problem is to prove the remaining properties.\n\nBut the example given had the problem statement as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\", with assumptions that n is an integer and n divisible by 7. However, in the original problem, n was any integer, not necessarily divisible by 7, and the correct answer is that it's divisible by 91 for all integers n. The example had a mistake in including \"n divisible by 7\" which wasn't in the original problem. So the assistant made an error there.\n\nSo in structuring the current problem, we need to be careful not to introduce incorrect assumptions. The user's original problem does not have any additional constraints beyond the definitions and the standard matrix spaces. So the assumptions would be the definitions and given properties.\n\nThus, the assumptions for the entire problem would be:\n\n- For a matrix A, the trace norm ‖A‖₁ is defined as trace(√(A*A)).\n- For any unitary matrices U and V, ‖UAV*‖₁ = ‖A‖₁.\n- ‖A‖₁ is equal to the sum of the singular values of A.\n- A is an m×n complex matrix (A ∈ M_{m×n}(ℂ)).\n- The operator norm ‖B‖ for a matrix B is the supremum of ‖Bx‖ / ‖x‖ over non-zero vectors x.\n- The operator norm ‖B‖ is equal to the maximum singular value of B.\n\nThe problem is to prove that ‖A‖₁ defines a matrix norm by verifying the remaining properties (3,4,5,6). However, the user specifically asks for parts 3)-5). The user mentions that 6) can follow from 5), so perhaps the main problem is parts 3,4,5.\n\nBut according to the format, the problem should be stated concisely. The original problem is to prove that ‖A‖₁ is a matrix norm. The user is focusing on properties 3,4,5. So structuring this, the problem would be:\n\nProblem: Prove that the trace norm ‖A‖₁ satisfies the following properties for matrices A ∈ M_{m×n}(ℂ):\n3) |trace(A)| ≤ ‖A‖₁,\n4) ‖BA‖₁ ≤ ‖B‖ ‖A‖₁ for B ∈ M_{l×m}(ℂ),\n5) ‖A‖₁ = sup_{‖B‖ ≤ 1} |trace(BA)| where B ∈ M_{n×m}(ℂ).\n\nSo combining all, the formatted problem would have assumptions related to the trace norm's definition, its unitary invariance, expression via singular values, the operator norm definition, and the problem would be to prove those three properties.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should list each assumption on a separate line and then the problem statement.",
