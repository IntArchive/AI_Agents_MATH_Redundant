    "Content": "I was wondering how to prove that $$\\lim_{n\\to \\infty}\\int_{1}^{n}\\frac{1}{(x^{2}+1)^{n}}dx\\sim \\frac{1}{n\\cdot 2^{n}}?.$$ This appears to be asymptotic to $\\frac{1}{n2^{n}}$, but how to prove it?. I checked with larger and larger values of n, and it does get closer and closer to \n$$\\frac{1}{n2^{n}}.$$ i.e \n$$\\int_{1}^{10}\\frac{1}{(x^{2}+1)^{10}}dx\\approx .00009843725636$$\nand \n$$\\frac{1}{10\\cdot 2^{10}}\\approx .00009765625.$$ The larger $n$, the closer they get. I tried using parts to no avail. I also thought $$\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}\\binom{-n}{k}x^{2k}=\\frac{1}{(1+x^{2})^{n}}$$ may be useful in some manner. Does anyone have a good idea as to how to prove this? Thanks",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Motivated by the simplicity of integrating from $0$, rather than $1$, substituting $x = 1+u$ gives $$2^n\\int_1^n{\\frac{dx}{(1+x^2)^n}} = \\int_0^{n-1}{\\frac{du}{(1+u+u^2/2)^n}}.$$ We seek estimates--an upper bound and a lower bound for the integrand--that will be simple to integrate.  Dropping the \"complicated\" $u^2/2$ term gives one obviously integrable estimate; continuing the pattern $1+u+u^2/2 + \\cdots + u^k/k! + \\cdots = e^u$ leads to another.  The resulting inequalities $1 + u < 1 + u + u^2/2 < e^u$ yield (for $n \\ge 1$) $$\\eqalign{\n\\frac{1}{n}\\left(1 - e^{-n(n-1)}\\right) &= \\int_0^{n-1}{e^{-n u}du} \\cr\n&\\lt \\int_0^{n-1}{\\frac{du}{(1+u+u^2/2)^n}} \\cr\n&\\lt \\int_0^{n-1}{\\frac{du}{(1+u)^n}} = \\frac{1}{n-1}\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{n^{n-1}}\\right) \\cr\n&\\lt \\frac{1}{n-1}.\n}$$ Both estimates are asymptotically $1/n$, QED.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants to prove that the limit of the integral from 1 to n of 1/(x² + 1)^n dx is asymptotic to 1/(n·2ⁿ). Hmm, asymptotic equivalence as n approaches infinity. So they want to show that the integral behaves like 1/(n·2ⁿ) for large n.\n\nFirst, let me recall what asymptotic equivalence means. We say f(n) ~ g(n) as n → ∞ if the limit of f(n)/g(n) approaches 1. So here, we need to show that the integral divided by 1/(n·2ⁿ) approaches 1 as n becomes large.\n\nLooking at the integral itself: ∫₁ⁿ 1/(x² + 1)^n dx. The integrand is 1 over (x² + 1) raised to the nth power. For large n, this function is sharply peaked around x=0 because (x² +1)^n grows rapidly as n increases, but here the integration is from 1 to n, not near zero. Wait, the lower limit is 1, not near zero. So maybe the main contribution to the integral comes from x near 1?\n\nWait, but as n increases, the upper limit is also going to infinity. Hmm, but the integrand at x = n is 1/(n² +1)^n, which decays like 1/n^{2n}, which is extremely small. Similarly, for large x, the integrand is negligible. So maybe the main contribution is from x near 1?\n\nLet me consider substitution. Let me set t = x - 1, so x = 1 + t. Then the integral becomes ∫₀^{n-1} 1/((1 + t)^2 + 1)^n dt. But that might not simplify things much. Alternatively, maybe Laplace's method or method of steepest descent for integrals with large exponents. Since the integrand has an exponent of n, which is large, the integral is dominated by the region where the integrand is maximized.\n\nSo first, find where the integrand is maximized on the interval [1, n]. The integrand is 1/(x² +1)^n. To maximize this, we need to minimize (x² +1). On [1, n], the minimum of x² +1 occurs at x=1, where it is 2. So the integrand is maximized at x=1, and decreases as x increases. Therefore, the main contribution to the integral comes from a neighborhood around x=1.\n\nTherefore, we can approximate the integral by expanding the integrand around x=1. Let's make the substitution x = 1 + t, where t is small. Then x² +1 = (1 + t)^2 +1 = 1 + 2t + t² +1 = 2 + 2t + t². For small t, this is approximately 2 + 2t. So (x² +1)^n ≈ (2 + 2t)^n = 2^n (1 + t)^n. Then 1/(x² +1)^n ≈ 1/(2^n (1 + t)^n). But t is small, so maybe we can approximate (1 + t)^n using the exponential? Wait, but when n is large and t is small, the product n*t might not be negligible. Hmm. Let's consider t = (x -1) and change variables to something that scales with n. Maybe set t = s/n, so that when n is large, t is small. Then x =1 + s/n.\n\nLet me try that substitution. Let x =1 + s/n. Then dx = ds/n. The integral becomes ∫_{s=0}^{s=n(n-1)} 1/( (1 + s/n)^2 +1 )^n * (ds/n). Hmm, but the upper limit becomes n(n-1) which is very large, but since the integrand decays exponentially, maybe we can extend the upper limit to infinity?\n\nLet me approximate the integrand. Let's expand (1 + s/n)^2 +1:\n\n(1 + 2s/n + s²/n²) +1 = 2 + 2s/n + s²/n².\n\nSo (x² +1) = 2 + 2s/n + s²/n² ≈ 2(1 + s/n + s²/(2n²)).\n\nBut for large n, the term s/n is small, so maybe we can approximate:\n\n(2(1 + s/n))^n ≈ 2^n e^{s} as n → ∞? Wait, because (1 + a/n)^n ≈ e^a. Wait, if I have (1 + s/n + ... )^n, but here we have 2(1 + s/n + ...). Wait, perhaps this approach is not straightforward. Alternatively, let's take logarithm of the integrand.\n\nThe integrand is [1/(x² +1)]^n. Taking the natural log, we get -n ln(x² +1). To apply Laplace's method, we approximate the integral ∫₁ⁿ e^{-n ln(x² +1)} dx. The function in the exponent is -n ln(x² +1). The maximum occurs at the minimum of ln(x² +1), which is at x=1. So expanding around x=1, let x =1 + y, where y is small. Then x² +1 = (1 + y)^2 +1 = 2 + 2y + y². Then ln(x² +1) = ln(2 + 2y + y²) ≈ ln(2) + (2y + y²)/2 - ( (2y + y²)^2 )/(8 ) + ... using Taylor series expansion around y=0.\n\nWait, maybe better to expand f(y) = ln(2 + 2y + y²) around y=0. Let me compute the derivatives:\n\nf(y) = ln(2 + 2y + y²)\n\nf(0) = ln(2)\n\nf’(y) = (2 + 2y)/(2 + 2y + y²) → f’(0) = 2/2 =1\n\nf''(y) = [ (2)(2 + 2y + y²) - (2 + 2y)(2 + 2y) ] / (2 + 2y + y²)^2\n\nWait, this might get complicated. Alternatively, note that near x=1, we can approximate ln(x² +1) ≈ ln(2) + (x -1) * d/dx [ln(x² +1)] at x=1 + higher order terms.\n\nCompute derivative d/dx ln(x² +1) = 2x/(x² +1). At x=1, this is 2*1/(1 +1) =1. So the first derivative is 1. Then the second derivative: d²/dx² ln(x² +1) = [2(x² +1) - 2x*2x]/(x² +1)^2 = [2x² +2 -4x²]/(x² +1)^2 = (-2x² +2)/(x² +1)^2. At x=1, this is (-2 +2)/(4) =0. Wait, so the second derivative is zero? Hmm, that's interesting. Then the third derivative? Maybe the expansion is:\n\nln(x² +1) ≈ ln(2) + (x -1) *1 + 0*(x -1)^2/2 + ...? Wait, but if the second derivative is zero, then the expansion would be up to third order terms?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use a substitution. Let’s set x =1 + t, then as t approaches 0, expand ln(x² +1) = ln(2 + 2t + t²). Let’s factor 2: ln(2(1 + t + t²/2)) = ln(2) + ln(1 + t + t²/2). Then expand ln(1 + t + t²/2) ≈ (t + t²/2) - (t + t²/2)^2/2 + ... For small t.\n\nSo ln(1 + t + t²/2) ≈ t + t²/2 - (t^2 + t^3 + t^4/4)/2 ≈ t + t²/2 - t²/2 - t^3/2 - t^4/8 ≈ t - t^3/2 - t^4/8.\n\nTherefore, ln(x² +1) ≈ ln(2) + t - t^3/2 - t^4/8, where t = x -1.\n\nBut maybe this is getting too detailed. Alternatively, since the second derivative is zero, perhaps the dominant term after the linear term is the cubic term. Therefore, the function near x=1 behaves like ln(2) + (x -1) - (x -1)^3/2 + ... So the exponent in the integrand is -n ln(x² +1) ≈ -n ln(2) -n (x -1) + n (x -1)^3/2 + ... But for Laplace method, we usually need a quadratic term, but here the quadratic term is zero. Hmm, this complicates things. So Laplace's method typically relies on the integral being dominated by a Gaussian-like integral around the maximum, which requires the second derivative to be negative (so the function has a maximum). But here, the second derivative is zero, so maybe the expansion is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the integral is dominated by the region very close to x=1, but due to the first non-zero derivative being higher order. Maybe we need to use a substitution that takes into account the third derivative. Let me recall that when the first non-zero derivative at the maximum is of order k, then the integral scales like n^{-1/k}. But here, the first derivative is non-zero? Wait, no: wait, at x=1, the first derivative of the exponent is -n times the derivative of ln(x² +1) at x=1. Wait, the exponent is -n ln(x² +1). The first derivative of this is -n * 2x/(x² +1). At x=1, that's -n*2*1/(1 +1) = -n. So the first derivative of the exponent is -n. Wait, but when we do the substitution, we need to consider that near x=1, the exponent can be approximated as -n ln(2) -n (x -1) + ... So that's linear in (x -1). But if the exponent is linear, then the integral would be dominated by the lower end? Wait, but the integral is from x=1 to x=n. If the exponent is -n ln(2) -n (x -1) + ..., then the integrand is e^{-n ln(2)} e^{-n(x -1)}. So e^{-n ln(2)} is 2^{-n}. Then the integrand is approximately 2^{-n} e^{-n(x -1)}. Then integrating from x=1 to x=∞ (since upper limit is n, but for large n, the integral up to n is almost the same as up to infinity). Then the integral is approximately 2^{-n} ∫₀^∞ e^{-n t} dt = 2^{-n} * (1/n). So the integral ~ 1/(n 2^n). Which matches the asymptotic given. But wait, this seems too straightforward. Is this correct?\n\nWait, let me verify. If near x=1, the integrand behaves like 2^{-n} e^{-n(x -1)}, then the integral from 1 to infinity would be 2^{-n} * ∫₀^∞ e^{-n t} dt = 2^{-n} * (1/n). Therefore, the integral is approximately 1/(n 2^n). So the asymptotic behavior is indeed 1/(n 2^n). Therefore, the leading term is captured by this approximation.\n\nBut to make this rigorous, we need to ensure that the contribution from the rest of the integral (away from x=1) is negligible. Since for x >1, the integrand 1/(x² +1)^n decreases rapidly as n increases. So even though the interval is up to n, the main contribution is near x=1. Therefore, extending the upper limit to infinity introduces an exponentially small error. Similarly, the lower limit is exactly at x=1, so the approximation holds.\n\nTherefore, the leading term is 1/(n 2^n), which matches the asymptotic equivalence given in the problem. Therefore, the proof can be done by using the substitution x =1 + t/n, expanding the integrand around t=0, and showing that the integral is dominated by this region, leading to the asymptotic behavior of 1/(n 2^n).\n\nAlternatively, another approach could be to use substitution x =1 + t, and then change variable to t = s/n, leading to the integral scaling as 1/(n 2^n). But the key idea is that near x=1, the integrand is approximately 2^{-n} e^{-n t}, and integrating over t from 0 to infinity gives 1/(n 2^n).\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Recognize that the integrand is maximized at x=1.\n\n2. Approximate the integrand near x=1 using a substitution that captures the decay away from x=1.\n\n3. Extend the limits of integration to infinity since the contributions away from x=1 are negligible.\n\n4. Compute the resulting integral, which is a simple exponential integral, leading to the asymptotic behavior 1/(n 2^n).\n\nThis seems like a solid approach. The user also mentioned using a binomial expansion, but perhaps that's more complicated. Alternatively, using Laplace's method as above is more straightforward.\n\nAnother thought: maybe use the substitution y = x -1, then x =1 + y, and as n becomes large, y is small. Then the integral becomes ∫₀^{n-1} [1/( (1 + y)^2 +1 )^n ] dy. Let's approximate (1 + y)^2 +1 = 2 + 2y + y² ≈ 2(1 + y) for small y. Then [1/(2(1 + y))]^n = (1/2^n) (1/(1 + y)^n). Then the integral is approximately (1/2^n) ∫₀^{n-1} 1/(1 + y)^n dy. But 1/(1 + y)^n decays very rapidly, so the integral from 0 to infinity is (1/2^n) * [1/(n-1)] ≈ 1/(n 2^n). This approximation also gives the desired result. However, the approximation (x² +1) ≈ 2(1 + y) might not capture the exact behavior, but perhaps it's sufficient for the leading term.\n\nIn any case, the main takeaway is that the integral is dominated by the region near x=1, and the leading term gives the asymptotic behavior of 1/(n 2^n). Therefore, the problem can be solved by applying Laplace's method or substitution to focus on the neighborhood around x=1.",
