    "Content": "Is there an easy way of showing that $2^n \\pm 1$ is never a perfect power, except for $2^3 + 1 = 3^2 $? I know that Catalan's conjecture (or Mihăilescu's theorem) gives the result directly, but I'm hopefully for a more elementary method. I can show that it is never a square, except for $2^3 + 1$. Proof: Cases $n=1, 2, 3$ are easily dealt with. Henceforth, let $n\\geq4$. $2^n -1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$ hence is never a square. If $2^n +1 =x^2$, then $2^n = (x-1)(x+1)$ and both of these are powers of 2. Thus we must have $(x-1) = 2, (x+1) = 4$. This gives the solution of $2^3 + 1 = 3^2$. Let's now do an odd prime. Say $2^n +1 = x^p$. Then $2^n = x^p - 1 = (x-1)(x^{p-1}+x^{p-2} + \\ldots +1)$, so both terms are powers of 2. We have $ x = 2^m+1$ is odd. But the other term is the sum of $p$ odd numbers, hence is odd. Since this is clearly greater than 1, we get a contradiction. Say $2^n -1 = x^p$. Then $2^n = x^p + 1 = (x+1)(x^{p-1} - x^{p-2} + \\ldots -x +1 )$, so both terms are powers of 2. We have $x = 2^m -1$ is odd. But the other term is the sum of $p$ odd numbers, hence is odd. Since $x^p + 1 \\neq x+1$ except for $p=1$, this means that the term is greater than 1. Hence we get a contradiction.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "(This proof was completed with an insightful comment from Gottfried. I'm placing it as an answer so that it is readily seen that an answer exists, as opposed to just leaving it in the question.) Suppose we have $ 2^n \\pm 1 = x^k$ for some positive integers $x, k$. Cases $n=1, 2, 3$ are easily dealt with. $n=3$ yields the solution $2^3 + 1 = 3^2$. Henceforth, let $n\\geq4$. Furthermore, a simple check shows that $x\\neq 1, 2$. First, we will deal with the power $k=2l$ being even. Rewriting $x^{2l}$ as $(x^l)^2$, we may assume that $k=2$. Proof:  $2^n -1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$ hence is never a square. If $2^n +1 =x^2$, then $2^n = (x-1)(x+1)$ and both of these are powers of 2 that differ by 2. Thus we must have $(x-1) = 2, (x+1) = 4$, which gives $2^n = 8$ so $n=3$ (reject). $_\\square$ Now, we deal with $k$ odd. Proof: Say $2^n +1 = x^k$. Then $2^n = x^k - 1 = (x-1)(x^{k-1}+x^{k-2} + \\ldots +1)$, so both terms are powers of 2. We have $ x -1$ is a power of 2 greater than 1, hence is even. Thus $x$ is odd. But the other term is the sum of $k$ odd numbers, hence is odd. Since this is clearly greater than 1, we get a contradiction. Say $2^n -1 = x^k$. Then $2^n = x^k + 1 = (x+1)(x^{k-1} - x^{k-2} + \\ldots -x +1 )$, so both terms are powers of 2. We have $x+1$ is a power of 2 that is greater than 1, hence is even. Thus $x$ is odd. But the other term is the sum of $p$ odd numbers, hence is odd. Since $x^p + 1 \\neq x+1$ except for $p=1$, this means that the term is greater than 1. Hence we get a contradiction. $ _\\square$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to show that 2^n ±1 is never a perfect power except for the case 2^3 +1 = 3^2. They mentioned Catalan's conjecture but are looking for a more elementary method. They provided a proof for squares and then tried to extend it to higher prime powers. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions from the original question. The problem statement is about when 2^n ±1 is a perfect power. The user's proof deals with cases where it's a square or an odd prime power. The exceptions are given, like n=3 for the +1 case. The assumptions here would include that n is an integer, and they considered different cases for n and the exponents. Let me list each assumption separately as per the required format.\n\nThe user split into cases: 2^n -1 is a square, 2^n +1 is a square, then moved to prime exponents. For each case, they assumed specific forms and derived contradictions. The key assumptions here are about n being an integer, n ≥4 for some cases, and the structure of x^p leading to contradictions based on parity and the sum of odd numbers. Each step in their proof introduces conditions like the exponent being an odd prime, or the terms being powers of 2. I need to list these as separate assumptions.\n\nWait, the original problem is to determine when 2^n ±1 is a perfect power, with the exception given. The user's approach handles squares and higher prime powers. So the assumptions would include n being an integer, n ≥1, considering both +1 and -1 cases, and that the perfect power is either a square or an odd prime power. Also, they considered the modulo 4 for the -1 case showing it's not a square. For the +1 case, breaking it into (x-1)(x+1) both being powers of 2. Then for prime exponents, similar decomposition leading to contradictions.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user is asking when 2^n ±1 is a perfect power, except for the known case. The formatted problem needs to capture the main question, and the assumptions would be the conditions given or implied. Since the user's own proof already handles some parts, maybe the key assumptions here are that n is an integer, and the perfect power is considered for exponents that are primes (since they handled squares and then odd primes). Wait, but in the problem statement, the user is asking for a general proof, so perhaps the assumptions are more about the structure of 2^n ±1 and the perfect power being a square or higher power, excluding the known case.\n\nLet me try to structure it:\n\nAssumptions:\n- n is an integer.\n- The equation 2^n ±1 = x^k holds for some integers x and k ≥2.\n- Except for the case 2^3 +1 = 3^2.\n\nProblem: Determine for which integers n, the numbers 2^n +1 or 2^n -1 are perfect powers (i.e., equal to x^k for integers x, k ≥2), other than the known case 2^3 +1 =3^2.\n\nWait, but the original question is asking when 2^n ±1 is a perfect power, except for that case. So the problem is to show that there are no other solutions besides the known one. The user's own proof handles squares and higher primes via elementary methods, so the problem would be to prove that 2^n ±1 is never a perfect power except for 2^3 +1 =3^2.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\nn is an integer.\nThe equation 2^n +1 = x^k or 2^n -1 = x^k holds for integers x and k ≥2.\nExcept when n=3, x=3, k=2 for the +1 case.\n\nBut the user's proof splits into cases for squares and prime exponents. However, the problem is to state the main question, so perhaps the formatted problem should be as the user originally asked, with the assumptions being that n is an integer, and the perfect power is considered for exponents ≥2. The exception is already mentioned in the problem.\n\nWait, looking back at the example given, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7. But in the user's problem here, the original question doesn't have such an assumption, except for the known solution. The user wants to show that except for n=3, there are no solutions. So perhaps the assumptions here are that n is an integer, and x and k are integers with k≥2. The problem is to prove that the only solution is n=3, x=3, k=2 for 2^n +1.\n\nBut the user's own proof already handles the square case and then odd primes. So perhaps the formatted problem should capture the main question, and the assumptions would include the known exception and the conditions on n, x, k.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n- x is an integer.\n- k is an integer with k ≥2.\n- The equation 2^n ±1 = x^k holds.\n- Except for the case 2^3 +1 =3^2.\n\nBut in the example provided, the assumptions were specific properties or conditions applied to one object. So each assumption is a separate line. So for this problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is an integer.\n- x is an integer.\n- k is an integer greater than or equal to 2.\n- Either 2^n +1 =x^k or 2^n -1 =x^k.\n- The case 2^3 +1=3^2 is excluded.\n\nBut the problem is to show that there are no other solutions. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: \nn is an integer,\nx is an integer,\nk is an integer with k ≥2,\neither 2^n +1 =x^k or 2^n -1 =x^k,\nthe case 2^3 +1=3^2 is excluded.\n\nProblem: Prove that the only solution to 2^n ±1 =x^k is when n=3, x=3, and k=2.\n\nBut looking back at the example, the assumptions were listed as separate lines, each addressing one property. For example, in the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" were two separate assumptions. So here, perhaps each assumption is a single condition on a single object.\n\nSo the original problem is to show that except for 2^3 +1=3^2, there are no other perfect powers of the form 2^n ±1. The user wants this problem structured with assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is an integer.\n- x is an integer.\n- k is an integer greater than or equal to 2.\n- The equation 2^n +1 =x^k or 2^n -1 =x^k holds.\n- The case where 2^3 +1=3^2 is excluded.\n\nBut the problem is to show that under these assumptions, there are no solutions except the excluded one. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: \nn is an integer,\nx is an integer,\nk is an integer with k ≥2,\neither 2^n +1 =x^k or 2^n -1 =x^k,\nexcluding the case 2^3 +1 =3^2.\n\nProblem: Prove that there are no integers n, x, k satisfying the above assumptions.\n\nBut the original question is \"When is 2^n ±1 a perfect power\", so the problem is to show that the only case is the excluded one. Therefore, the problem statement would be:\n\nProblem: Prove that the only solution to 2^n ±1 =x^k (for integers n, x, k ≥2) is 2^3 +1=3^2.\n\nBut according to the example, the problem statement should be concise. The example's problem was \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91.\" Here, the problem is to show that except for the known case, 2^n ±1 is never a perfect power.\n\nSo putting it all together, the formatted problem would have assumptions that list all the conditions, and the problem is to prove there are no other solutions.\n\nBut the user's own proof already handles the square case and then primes, so maybe the problem is just the original question. But the example's formatted problem included some assumptions that were perhaps part of the problem but not explicitly stated. Wait, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, no, actually in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem had assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, leading to the problem statement being to prove divisibility by 91. Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, the original problem was to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, they listed assumptions as n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that might be a mistake. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added n divisible by 7 as an assumption. That seems incorrect. Perhaps the example was a bad example? Because if the original problem is for every integer n, then the assumption should be n is an integer, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. But the example's formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which changes the problem. Maybe the example was wrong. But the user provided that as their example. So perhaps in their format, they include both the problem's original conditions and any additional assumptions. Maybe the original problem had a typo? Wait, let me check:\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by 7.\nProblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that's inconsistent. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That changes the problem. So perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user is following that format. Therefore, perhaps when structuring the problem, they want to list all assumptions, including those that are part of the problem's premise. In the example, maybe the problem was miswritten, but following that, for the current problem, we need to list all assumptions.\n\nBut in the current problem, the original question is general: for which n is 2^n ±1 a perfect power, except for the known case. The user's own proof handles several cases, but the main problem doesn't have additional constraints on n other than being an integer. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is an integer.\n- x and k are integers with k ≥2.\n- 2^n ±1 =x^k.\n- The case 2^3 +1=3^2 is excluded.\n\nBut in the example, the problem was restated with some assumptions. Maybe the key is to extract from the original question the specific conditions. The original question is asking for when 2^n ±1 is a perfect power, except for the known case. So the problem is to determine that there are no solutions other than the known case, hence the assumptions are that n, x, k are integers with k≥2, and 2^n ±1 =x^k, and the problem is to show that this can only happen in the excluded case.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nx is an integer,\nk is an integer with k ≥2,\neither 2^n +1 =x^k or 2^n -1 =x^k,\nexcluding the case 2^3 +1=3^2.\n\nProblem: Prove that there are no solutions to the equation 2^n ±1 =x^k for integers n, x, k ≥2 except for 2^3 +1=3^2.\n\nBut according to the example, assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property of one object. So each assumption should be a separate line:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nx is an integer,\nk is an integer,\nk is greater than or equal to 2,\neither 2^n +1 =x^k or 2^n -1 =x^k,\nthe case 2^3 +1=3^2 is excluded.\n\nProblem: Prove that there are no solutions to the equations 2^n +1 =x^k or 2^n -1 =x^k under the given assumptions.\n\nBut perhaps the problem statement can be phrased as in the original question: \"When is 2^n ±1 a perfect power\", with the answer being only the known case. So the problem is to show that the only solution is the excluded one.\n\nAlternatively, considering the example, maybe the problem is restated more concisely. In the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect, but following that pattern, perhaps the current problem needs to have assumptions extracted from the user's proof steps.\n\nWait, the user's proof steps mention cases for n=1,2,3, and n≥4, showing for n≥4, 2^n -1 ≡3 mod4 hence not square, and for 2^n +1 being square, leading to x-1 and x+1 being powers of 2. Then for odd primes, similar arguments. So the assumptions in their proof are that n is an integer, and they consider different ranges of n. But in the problem statement, the user is asking for a general proof, not restricted to certain n.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem's assumptions should capture the necessary conditions. The key assumptions are:\n\n- n is an integer.\n- The expressions 2^n +1 or 2^n -1 are perfect powers (i.e., equal to x^k where x and k are integers with k≥2).\n- The case 2^3 +1=3^2 is excluded.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nx and k are integers,\nk ≥2,\neither 2^n +1 =x^k or 2^n -1 =x^k,\nexcluding the case 2^3 +1=3^2.\n\nProblem: Prove that there are no integers n, x, k satisfying the above assumptions.\n\nBut to match the example's style, maybe the problem is phrased as the original question. The example had the problem statement as \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91.\" So here, the problem could be \"Prove that 2^n ±1 is never a perfect power except for 2^3 +1=3^2.\"\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would list the conditions:\n\n- n is an integer.\n- A perfect power is an integer of the form x^k where x and k are integers with k ≥2.\n- The case 2^3 +1=3^2 is excluded.\n\nBut in the example, they listed the assumptions as separate lines, each about one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nx is an integer,\nk is an integer,\nk ≥2,\neither 2^n +1 =x^k or 2^n -1 =x^k,\nthe case 2^3 +1=3^2 is excluded.\n\nProblem: Prove that there are no integers n, x, k satisfying the above equations under the given assumptions.\n\nBut perhaps the problem can be more succinctly stated as in the original question: \"When is 2^n ±1 a perfect power? Show that the only solution is 2^3 +1=3^2.\"\n\nBut following the example, the problem statement should be a directive to prove something, given the assumptions. So the final answer would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nn is an integer,\nx is an integer,\nk is an integer,\nk ≥2,\neither 2^n +1 =x^k or 2^n -1 =x^k,\nthe case 2^3 +1=3^2 is excluded.\nProblem: \nProve that there are no integers n, x, k satisfying the equations 2^n ±1 =x^k under the given assumptions.",
