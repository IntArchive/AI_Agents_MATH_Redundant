    "Content": "I have read several answers ( example 1 , example 2 ) about continuity of $e^x$ , but most rely on Power Series definition of $e^x$ , or sequential definition of a limit, or squeeze theorem. I would like a brute-force proof that meets the following criteria: Does NOT use sequential definition of limit Does NOT use Squeeze Theorem Uses $\\epsilon-\\delta$ definition of continuity directly Does NOT use perturbations (e.g. $|e^{a + h} - e^a|$ ) Uses definition of limit, starting with a $0 < |x-a| < \\delta$ and ending with $|e^x - e^a| < \\epsilon$ Is NOT based on power series definition of $e^x$ Is based on elementary limit definition $e^x = \\lim_{n \\to 0} (1+n)^{\\frac{x}{n}}$ I would like to use exponential bounds (which come from Bernoulli's Inequality) like this answer : \\begin{align*}\ny+1 \\le \\ & \\ e^y \\le \\frac{1}{1-y} \\\\\n\\to \\quad \\quad y \\le \\ & \\ e^y - 1 \\ \\le \\ \\frac{y}{1-y} \\\\\n\\to \\quad x-a \\le \\ & \\ e^{x-a}-1 \\ \\le \\ \\frac{x-a}{1-(x-a)}\n\\end{align*} except I am trying to modify that proof so it doesn't depend on Squeeze Theorem. Proof attempt : Let $\\epsilon > 0$ and $a > 0$ arbitrary. Choose $\\delta = \\frac{\\epsilon}{e^a}$ . Then \\begin{align*}\n& \\quad 0 < |x - a| < \\delta \\quad \\quad \\quad \\textrm{ (Given)}\\\\\n&\\to \\quad |e^{x-a}-1| \\quad < \\delta \\quad \\quad \\textrm{ (Reason unknown?)} \\\\\n&\\to \\quad |e^{x-a}-1| < \\frac{\\epsilon}{e^a} \\quad \\quad \\textrm{ (Substitute $\\delta=\\frac{\\epsilon}{e^a}$)} \\\\\n&\\to \\quad e^a|e^{x-a}-1| < \\epsilon \\quad \\quad \\textrm{ (Multiply both sides by $e^a$)} \\\\\n&\\to \\quad |e^x-e^a| < \\epsilon \\quad \\quad  \\quad \\textrm{ (Distribute $e^a$ into absolute value)} \\\\\n& \\to \\quad \\lim_{x \\to a} e^x = e^a \\quad \\quad \\quad \\textrm{ (Definition of limit)}\n\\end{align*} I know my proof is supposed to use the exponential bounds, $$x-a \\le e^{x-a}-1 \\le \\frac{x-a}{1-(x-a)},$$ so I tried using it (probably incorrectly) in step 2. Just because $|x-a| < \\delta$ doesn't mean $e^{x-a}-1$ (bigger) is also less than $\\delta$ . It may be bigger than $\\delta$ . So I am having trouble going from step 1 to step 2. Edit 7/29 ( $2^{nd}$ Proof Attempt) : Some comments are suggesting, based on Chappers' answer here , that I should choose $$\\delta=\\max\\left\\{|x-a|, \\left|\\frac{x-a}{1-(x-a)}\\right|\\right\\}.$$ Making this substitution, our proof becomes \\begin{align*}\n& \\quad 0 < |x - a| < \\delta \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad\\textrm{ (Given)}\\\\\n& \\quad 0 < |x - a| < \\max\\left\\{|x-a|, \\left|\\frac{x-a}{1-(x-a)}\\right| \\right\\} \\quad \\quad \\quad \\textrm{ (Substitution of $\\delta$)}\\\\\n&\\quad \\quad \\quad \\vdots \\\\\n&\\quad \\quad \\quad ? \\\\\n&\\quad \\quad \\quad \\vdots \\\\\n&\\to \\quad e^a|e^{x-a}-1| < \\epsilon \\quad \\quad \\textrm{ (Multiply both sides by $e^a$)} \\\\\n&\\to \\quad |e^x-e^a| < \\epsilon \\quad \\quad  \\quad \\textrm{ (Distribute $e^a$ into absolute value)} \\\\\n& \\to \\quad \\lim_{x \\to a} e^x = e^a \\quad \\quad \\quad \\textrm{ (Definition of limit)}\n\\end{align*} I am not sure how to fill in the gaps. The left hand side needs to somehow become $e^a |e^{x-a}-1|$ . The right hand side needs to become $\\epsilon$ . But it seems to me that by making this choice, $\\delta$ is no longer a function of $\\epsilon$ . Edit 8/19 (Final proof): For those it helps, here's my final proof based off Paramanand Singh's answer: Let $\\epsilon > 0$ and $a>0$ arbitrary. Choose $\\delta= \\frac{1}{2}\\min\\left\\{1,\\frac{\\epsilon}{e^a}\\right\\}$ . Then \\begin{align*}\n& \\quad \\left|x - a\\right| < \\delta \\tag{Given} \\\\\n\\to& \\quad \\left|x - a\\right| < \\frac{1}{2} \\min\\left\\{1, \\frac{\\epsilon}{e^a}\\right\\} \\tag{$\\delta = \\frac{1}{2}\\min\\left\\{1,\\frac{\\epsilon}{e^a}\\right\\}$} \\\\\n\\to& \\quad 2\\left|x - a\\right| < \\min\\left\\{1, \\frac{\\epsilon}{e^a}\\right\\} \\tag{Multiplication by 2} \\\\\n\\to& \\quad \\left|\\frac{x-a}{1-(x-a)}\\right| < \\min\\left\\{1,\\frac{\\epsilon}{e^a}\\right\\} \\tag{$\\left|\\frac{h}{1-h}\\right|<2|h|$ if $|h|<\\frac{1}{2}$} \\\\\n\\to& \\quad \\left|\\frac{x-a}{1-(x-a)}\\right| < \\frac{\\epsilon}{e^a} \\tag{$\\min\\left\\{1,\\frac{\\epsilon}{e^a}\\right\\}< \\frac{\\epsilon}{e^a}$} \\\\\n\\to& \\quad \\left|e^{x-a}-1\\right| < \\frac{\\epsilon}{e^a} \\tag{Exponential Bound Lemma} \\\\\n\\to& \\quad e^a\\left|e^{x-a}-1\\right| < \\epsilon \\tag{Multiplication by $e^a$} \\\\\n\\to& \\quad \\left|e^a\\cdot e^{x-a}-e^a\\right| < \\epsilon \\tag{Distribution Property} \\\\\n\\to& \\quad \\left|e^x-e^a\\right| < \\epsilon \\tag{$e^s\\cdot e^t = e^{s+t}$} \\\\\n\\to& \\quad \\lim_{x \\to a} e^x = e^a \\tag{Definition of limit}\n\\end{align*} The above proof relies on the facts $e^x\\cdot e^y=e^{x+y}$ and also the Exponential Bound Lemma $e^x \\ge 1+x$ , which gives \\begin{align*}\n& \\quad e^h \\ge \\left(1+\\frac{h}{n}\\right)^n \\\\\n\\to& \\quad e^h \\ge 1+h \\\\\n\\to& \\quad e^{-h} \\ge 1-h \\\\\n\\to& \\quad e^h \\le \\frac{1}{1-h} \\\\\n\\to& \\quad e^h-1 \\le \\frac{h}{1-h}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This is an expansion of my comments. Using any chosen definition of $e^x$ (eg $e^x=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} (1+(x/n))^n$ ) one needs to establish the following two properties of $e^x$ : $e^{x+y} =e^xe^y\\, \\forall x, y\\in\\mathbb {R} $ $e^x\\geq 1+x\\,\\forall x\\in(-1,1)$ The second property holds for all real $x$ , but it is sufficient (for current question) if one can establish it for the interval $(-1,1)$ . We proceed on the assumption that the above mentioned properties of $e^x$ are proved. Consider any arbitrary $\\epsilon>0$ and let us analyze the target inequality $$|e^{a+h} - e^a|<\\epsilon\\tag{1} $$ where $a$ is fixed and $h$ is variable. This is equivalent to $$|e^h-1|<\\epsilon e^{-a}\\tag{2} $$ Next we impose a restriction that $|h|<1/2$ . If $0<h<1/2$ then we have $$e^{-h} \\geq 1-h$$ or $$e^h\\leq \\frac{1}{1-h}$$ or $$e^h-1\\leq \\frac{h} {1-h}<2h\\tag{3} $$ If $-1/2<h<0$ then we have $$|e^h-1|=1-e^h=\\frac{e^{-h} - 1}{e^{-h}}<e^{-h}-1$$ And using $(3)$ we thus obtain $$|e^h-1|<2(-h)=2|h|$$ Hence we have proved that if $0<|h|<1/2$ then $$|e^h-1|<2|h|\\tag {4}$$ Let us now choose $\\delta'=\\epsilon e^{-a} /2$ and $\\delta =\\min(1/2,\\delta')$ . Then for all values of $h$ with $0<|h|<\\delta$ we have $$|e^h-1|<2|h|<\\epsilon e^{-a} $$ and thus the desired inequality $(2)$ (and equivalently $(1)$ ) holds. It follows that $e^x$ is a continuous at point $a$ . Some concerns have been raised in comments by Oliver Diaz and presumably these are due to the fact that I haven't presented the details of the definition of $e^x$ suggested in this answer. A simple development of this definition is available in this answer and you may have a look at it.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about proving the continuity of the exponential function using a specific δ-ε approach without relying on certain methods like power series or the squeeze theorem. The user wants the assumptions and problem clearly listed.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the problem and filter out the unnecessary details. The key points are the constraints on the proof method and the definitions used. The assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. The problem is to prove continuity of e^x at any point a using the given limit definition and inequalities derived from Bernoulli's inequality.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are about the properties of the objects involved. In this case, the assumptions would include the ε-δ definition of continuity, the specific limit definition of e^x, the exponential bounds from Bernoulli's Inequality, and the exclusion of certain theorems like the squeeze theorem or sequential limits.\n\nI need to list each assumption separately. For example, using the ε-δ definition directly is one assumption. Not using the squeeze theorem is another. Using the specific limit definition for e^x and the exponential bounds are other assumptions. Each of these should be a separate line under the assumption section.\n\nThe problem statement itself is to prove that e^x is continuous at any a > 0 using these constraints. So the final problem part will be that statement.\n\nI should check if there are any other implicit assumptions, like the properties of exponential functions (e.g., e^(x+y) = e^x e^y), but since the user mentions using the limit definition and the exponential bounds, maybe those should be included as assumptions too. Wait, the user's final proof uses the property e^x e^y = e^(x+y), so that's an important assumption. Also, the exponential bounds derived from Bernoulli's Inequality are crucial.\n\nSo, breaking it down:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The proof must use the ε-δ definition of continuity directly.\n- The proof must not use the squeeze theorem.\n- The proof must not use sequential definitions of limits.\n- The proof must not use perturbations like |e^(a+h) - e^a|.\n- The proof is based on the limit definition e^x = lim_{n→0} (1 + n)^(x/n).\n- The proof uses exponential bounds derived from Bernoulli's Inequality: y + 1 ≤ e^y ≤ 1/(1 - y) for y < 1.\n- The exponential function property e^x * e^y = e^(x + y) is used.\n- The proof must not use the power series definition of e^x.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption affecting different parts of the proof. The problem is to prove the continuity of e^x at any a > 0 under these constraints.\n\nNow, I need to structure this into the specified format. Each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then the problem statement.",
