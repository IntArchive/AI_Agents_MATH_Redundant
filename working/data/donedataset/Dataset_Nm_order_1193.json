    "Content": "I have a question that I need help with getting started (possibly I would be back for more help). I have a measure space $(X,A,\\mu)$ that is finite, and $f \\in L^{\\infty}(\\mu)$.

I need to show that the limit is: $$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\,\\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} = \\|f\\|_{\\infty} .$$ I am stuck on getting started, anybody have any suggestions? thanks much",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "(Note added 2017.04.23 by @Did.) The note below by the OP describes incorrectly the trouble with this answer. To be brief, not much can be saved from this post and the lack of desire of this OP and of the asker (both still present on the site) to correct the situation is flabbergasting. For more details please see the comments thread. Note added: I make a mistake here. First I thought that $\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}=L$ would imply $\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}(a_n)^{\\frac{1}{n}}=L$. But this is not correct. Please refer to the proof by @Did. First it's easy to see that \n$$(a_n)^{\\frac{1}{n}}=\\Big(\\int_X|f|^nd\\mu\\Big)^{\\frac{1}{n}}\\leq\\|f\\|_\\infty\\mu(X)^\\frac{1}{n},$$\nwhich implies that \n$$\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}(a_n)^{\\frac{1}{n}}\\leq\\|f\\|_\\infty,$$\nwhere we have used the fact that $\\mu(X)$ is finite.\nOn the other hand, by definition of $\\|f\\|_\\infty$, for all $\\epsilon>0$, there exists a measurable set $E$ in $X$ such that $\\mu(E)>0$ and $f\\geq \\|f\\|_\\infty-\\epsilon$ on $E$. Hence, we have\n$$(a_n)^{\\frac{1}{n}}=\\Big(\\int_X|f|^nd\\mu\\Big)^{\\frac{1}{n}}\\geq\\Big(\\int_E|f|^nd\\mu\\Big)^{\\frac{1}{n}}=(\\|f\\|_\\infty-\\epsilon)\\mu(E)^{\\frac{1}{n}}.$$\nAs $n\\rightarrow\\infty$, we have\n$$\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}(a_n)^{\\frac{1}{n}}\\geq(\\|f\\|_\\infty-\\epsilon).$$\nCombining the above inequalities, we have\n$$\\|f\\|_\\infty\\geq\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}(a_n)^{\\frac{1}{n}}\\geq(\\|f\\|_\\infty-\\epsilon).$$\nSince $\\epsilon>0$ is arbitrary, we have \n$$\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}(a_n)^{\\frac{1}{n}}=\\|f\\|_\\infty.$$ Now the result follows easily from the fact that $$\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}=\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}(a_n)^{\\frac{1}{n}}.$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to parse the original question and extract the necessary information. \n\nThe title is about showing that the limit of the ratio a_{n+1}/a_n as n approaches infinity equals the L-infinity norm of f. The question mentions a measure space (X, A, μ) which is finite, and f is in L∞(μ). The sequence a_n is defined as the integral of |f|^n over X with respect to μ. The goal is to prove the stated limit.\n\nNow, I need to list all assumptions, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let's break down the given information:\n\n1. The measure space (X, A, μ) is finite. That means μ(X) is finite.\n2. The function f belongs to L∞(μ), so f is essentially bounded.\n3. The sequence a_n is defined as the integral of |f|^n over X.\n\nWait, are there any other implicit assumptions? For example, the problem might require that a_n is non-zero for sufficiently large n to avoid division by zero in the ratio a_{n+1}/a_n. But maybe that's covered by the fact that f is in L∞ and μ is finite. If f is non-zero, then |f|^n would have some integral, but if f is zero almost everywhere, then a_n would be zero for all n. However, since f is in L∞, if it's non-zero, its L∞ norm is positive, and maybe that ensures a_n grows or behaves in a certain way. But the problem statement probably assumes f is not zero, or that the limit is considered when a_n is non-zero. But since the user hasn't specified, maybe it's better to include that as an assumption. Wait, the original problem doesn't mention f being non-zero, but maybe it's implied because otherwise the limit would be 0/0. Hmm, but the user didn't state that. However, in the context of L∞ norm, if f is zero a.e., then ||f||_∞ is zero, and a_n would be zero for all n, making the ratio undefined. So perhaps the problem assumes that f is not zero a.e. Alternatively, maybe the ratio is considered in the extended real numbers. But since the problem asks to show the limit equals ||f||_∞, which could be zero if f is zero, but in that case, the ratio would be 0/0, which is undefined. Therefore, maybe there's an implicit assumption that f is not zero almost everywhere. But the original problem doesn't state this explicitly, so should I include it? Or is it covered by f being in L∞? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem works under the general case where if ||f||_∞ is zero, then the ratio is considered as zero. But since the problem statement is to show that the limit equals ||f||_∞, even when f is zero, but in that case, a_n = 0 for all n, so the ratio is undefined. Therefore, the problem might be assuming that ||f||_∞ > 0. But since the original problem doesn't specify, perhaps we should not include that as an assumption. The user might have to handle that case separately, but perhaps the problem expects the reader to assume that f is non-zero. Alternatively, maybe the problem implicitly assumes that a_n is non-zero for sufficiently large n, which would be the case if the essential supremum is positive. So maybe we can include that as an assumption. Wait, but the original problem doesn't state it, so perhaps the user expects the answer to structure based only on the given information. Let me check the example provided again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem mentions that A(n) is divisible by 91, and the assumptions listed were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, it's listed as an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems contradictory. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That suggests that maybe the example might have a mistake, but perhaps the user intended to filter out unrelated information. Wait, maybe the original problem had a typo or the user restructured it. Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" But 91 is 7*13. If n is any integer, then maybe the problem actually requires that n is divisible by both 7 and 13? Or maybe the original problem had a mistake, and the formatted problem corrected it. Alternatively, perhaps the example is incorrect. But regardless, the user's instruction is to list all assumptions from the problem, each addressing one property applied to one object.\n\nBack to the current problem. The original problem states:\n\n- Measure space (X, A, μ) is finite.\n- f ∈ L∞(μ).\n- a_n = ∫_X |f|^n dμ.\n- Need to show lim_{n→∞} a_{n+1}/a_n = ||f||_∞.\n\nAssumptions to list:\n\n1. The measure space (X, A, μ) is finite. (So μ(X) < ∞.)\n2. The function f is in L∞(μ). (So f is essentially bounded.)\n3. The sequence a_n is defined as the integral of |f|^n over X with respect to μ.\n\nAre there any other assumptions? For instance, that f is non-zero, or that a_n is non-zero for sufficiently large n? The original problem doesn't state this, but without f being non-zero, a_n would be zero for all n if f is zero a.e. But in that case, the ratio a_{n+1}/a_n would be undefined. Therefore, perhaps the problem implicitly assumes that ||f||_∞ > 0. But since the original problem doesn't mention it, should I include it? Or is it considered part of the problem's challenge to handle cases where ||f||_∞ might be zero?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects that the user considers the case where ||f||_∞ > 0 separately and handles the zero case trivially. But since the problem says \"show that the limit is equal to ||f||_∞\", perhaps the zero case is allowed, but in that case, if f is zero a.e., then a_n = 0 for all n, making the ratio undefined, so the limit wouldn't exist. Therefore, perhaps the problem assumes that ||f||_∞ > 0. But again, the original problem doesn't specify. Therefore, maybe the correct approach is to list only the explicitly stated assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. The measure space (X, A, μ) is finite.\n2. The function f belongs to L∞(μ).\n3. The sequence a_n is defined as a_n = ∫_X |f|^n dμ.\n\nNow, the problem is to show that the limit of a_{n+1}/a_n as n approaches infinity equals ||f||_∞.\n\nWait, but maybe another assumption is that a_n ≠ 0 for sufficiently large n. Because if a_n is zero, the ratio is undefined. So perhaps we need to include that as an assumption. But since the problem statement doesn't mention it, but it's necessary for the problem to make sense, should we include it as an assumption? For example, if f is zero a.e., then a_n = 0 for all n, but the problem might consider that case as trivial where ||f||_∞ = 0, but the ratio is undefined. Therefore, the problem might be assuming that f is not zero a.e., hence ||f||_∞ > 0, ensuring that for large n, a_n is positive. However, since this is not stated explicitly, I'm conflicted. \n\nLooking back at the example, in the original problem, the user had to structure the problem with the assumption that n is divisible by 7, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". This suggests that perhaps in the example, the user made a mistake, or perhaps there was a typo in the original problem. Alternatively, maybe the original problem in the example had an implicit condition that n is divisible by 7, but the way it was phrased was confusing. Therefore, following the user's example, perhaps we should list only the explicit assumptions from the problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the explicit assumptions are:\n\n- Finite measure space.\n- f ∈ L∞(μ).\n- a_n = ∫ |f|^n dμ.\n\nTherefore, those three points are the assumptions. The problem is to show the limit equals the L∞ norm.\n\nSo, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe measure space $(X, A, \\mu)$ is finite,\n$f$ belongs to $L^{\\infty}(\\mu)$,\n$a_n$ is defined as $\\int_X |f|^n \\, d\\mu$.\nProblem:\nShow that $$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} = \\|f\\|_{\\infty}.$$\n\nBut wait, in the example, each assumption is a separate line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe measure space $(X, A, \\mu)$ is finite,\n$f$ is an element of $L^{\\infty}(\\mu)$,\n$a_n$ is defined as $\\int_X |f|^n \\, d\\mu$.\nProblem:\nShow that $$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} = \\|f\\|_{\\infty}.$$\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each assumption is on a separate line, addressing one property or condition applied to one object. The measure space being finite is one assumption. The function f being in L∞ is another. The definition of a_n is the third. The problem is to show the limit.\n\nI think that's all. No other hidden assumptions are stated in the original problem. The user might need to consider cases where ||f||_∞ is zero, but since the problem statement doesn't specify, we can't assume that. The problem as stated includes all necessary conditions.",
