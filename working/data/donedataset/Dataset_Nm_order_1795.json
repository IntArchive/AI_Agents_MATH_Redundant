    "Content": "The inequality $$\\boxed{e^3 > 20}$$ is occasionally useful, including in the answer I wrote for this question that comes from a GRE subject exam. This bound is relatively tight: $$e^3 = 20.08553\\!\\ldots ,$$ a relative error of $< \\frac{1}{200}$ , which means establishing the inequality might be a little delicate. In a comment under the linked answer, TheSimpliFire posed the following natural question: What is an efficient way to prove the inequality $e^3 > 20$ by hand? (I would have guessed that this had been asked before, but neither the internal search nor searchonmath turned up any duplicates.) A naive method is to use the series truncation $$e = \\sum_{k = 0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k!} > 1 + 1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{24} + \\frac{1}{120} = \\frac{120 + 120 + 60 + 20 + 5 + 1}{160} = \\frac{163}{60} .$$ Then, it suffices to prove that $\\left(\\frac{163}{60}\\right)^3 > 20$ , which is equivalent to $4\\,330\\,747 > 4\\,320\\,000$ . This last step could even be outsourced to an enthusiastic primary school student, but it involves cubing a three-digit prime and so is slightly tedious. One might try to refine this method by looking for rationals that are easier to cube, but the only rational numbers satisfying $\\sqrt[3]{20} < q < e$ with denominator $< 60$ are $\\frac{106}{39}, \\frac{125}{46}, \\frac{144}{53}$ . It's again straightforward to show that the cube of any of these $> 20$ , but doing so is no faster than cubing $\\frac{163}{60}$ and one then has the additional burden of showing the number is $< e$ . One could also search for integrals analogous to the classic Dalzell integrals for the difference $e^3 - 20$ (or to the difference corresponding to some other inequality equivalent thereto), by which I mean evidently positive definite integrals equal to that difference. For example, some experimentation yields the definite integral \\begin{align}\n&\\int_1^2 - \\frac{(x - 1) (2 - x) p(x) \\,dx}{20 x (x^2 + 1)} \\\\\n&\\qquad = \\int_1^2 \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} x^3 + \\frac{63}{20} x^2 - \\frac{153}{20} x + 9 - \\frac{3}{x} - \\frac{2 x}{x^2 + 1} \\right) dx \\\\\n&\\qquad = 3 - \\log 20 ,\n\\end{align} where $p(x) = 10 x^4 - 33 x^3 + 44 x^2 - 45 x + 30$ . Computing gives that all of the coefficients of $p(x + 1)$ are positive, so $p$ is strictly positive for $x \\geq 1$ , and thus the integrand is strictly positive on $(1, 2)$ . So, the integral is positive, that is, $3 > \\log 20$ , which is equivalent via exponentiation to $e^3 > 20$ . This is again elementary, but not terribly fast. Remark Incidentally this latter method lets us extract cheap but relatively sharp rational bounds on $\\log 20$ : Since $2 < x (x^2 + 1) < 10$ on the interval of integration, our integral is bounded by polynomial integrals: $$\\int_1^2 - \\frac{(x - 1) (2 - x) p(x) \\,dx}{20 \\cdot 10} < \\int_1^2 - \\frac{(x - 1) (2 - x) p(x) \\,dx}{20 x (x^2 + 1)} < \\int_1^2 - \\frac{(x - 1) (2 - x) p(x) \\,dx}{20 \\cdot 2} .$$ Integrating gives $$\\frac{163}{84000} < 3 - \\log 20 < \\frac{163}{16800},$$ and rearranging gives the bounds $$2.99027\\!\\ldots = \\frac{251185}{84000} < \\log 20 < \\frac{251837}{84000} = 2.99805\\!\\ldots .$$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Similar to your last proof, I found a positive function whose integral is $e^3-20$ . For $$f(x)=\\frac{1}{186}(x-1)^2(x-2)^4e^x\\ge0$$ we have $$\\int_{0}^{3}f(x)dx=e^3-20$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to format the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question according to the given example. Let me read through the original question carefully.\n\nThe title is \"Show that e³ > 20\". The user wants an efficient way to prove this inequality by hand. They mention several methods tried, like series truncation and integrals, but find them tedious. The problem is to prove e³ > 20. \n\nLooking at the example, the Assumptions section lists each condition applied to one object. In the original example, they had assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, for this problem, I need to figure out if there are any assumptions. The problem itself is to prove e³ > 20. The user mentions that e³ is approximately 20.0855, so it's a tight bound. But the problem itself doesn't state any specific conditions or assumptions beyond the inequality. \n\nWait, the user talks about methods involving integrals and series, but the actual problem doesn't have any given assumptions. The example had assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7, but here, maybe the only assumption is that e is the base of the natural logarithm. But that's a definition, not an assumption. The problem is to show e³ exceeds 20. Since there's no given condition like \"for n being an integer\" here, perhaps the problem has no assumptions beyond standard mathematical definitions. But the example included assumptions even if they were part of the problem statement. Wait, in the original example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Wait, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait no, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem's assumption was n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. So perhaps there was a mistake? Wait, maybe the example was incorrect? Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption adds \"n is divisible by 7\", which would restrict it, which seems incorrect. Wait, perhaps the example was a mistake, but the user is providing that as an example. Wait, maybe the user intended the example to have an assumption that n is an integer, and then the problem is to prove divisibility by 91 under that assumption. But in reality, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is that n is an integer, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. So the formatted problem's assumption is correct in that case. \n\nSo back to the current problem. The question is to prove that e³ > 20. Are there any assumptions here? The problem as stated doesn't mention any specific conditions. The original problem in the example included assumptions that were part of the problem statement, so here, if there are no given conditions, maybe the assumption section is empty. But the example's original problem was \"for every integer n\", which became an assumption. So maybe here, the assumption is that e is the base of the natural logarithm? But that's a definition. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe there are no assumptions, but the problem is simply to prove e³ > 20. But according to the user's format, the Assumption section is required. Looking back at the example, even if the original problem didn't state any additional assumptions beyond \"n is an integer\", the formatted problem lists that as an assumption. So perhaps here, even though the problem is straightforward, the assumption is that e is the exponential constant. But that's a given. Alternatively, maybe the problem doesn't have any assumptions. Wait, the user's example includes assumptions even if they are part of the problem's universal quantifier. So perhaps in this case, since the problem is to prove e³ > 20, and there's no variable or condition given, maybe there are no assumptions. But the format requires an assumption section. Let me check the example again. The original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n...\", so the formatted problem's assumption is \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that can't be. Because if the original problem is for every integer n, then in the formatted problem, the assumption shouldn't have \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, maybe there was a mistake in the example? Or perhaps the example is a different problem. Wait, the example's original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91\", but the formatted problem's assumption lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory because the original problem is for every integer n, but the formatted problem adds an extra condition that n is divisible by 7. That would change the problem. Maybe the example is incorrect. Wait, perhaps the original problem was intended to be for n divisible by 7, but the user made a mistake in the example. Alternatively, maybe the example is correct, and the user intended to show that even if the original problem had \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem can include specific assumptions. But that would be incorrect. Hmm. This is confusing. Maybe I should focus on the current problem. Since the user provided an example where the original problem had a universal quantifier and the formatted problem listed assumptions, even if they are part of the quantifier. So in the current problem, \"Show that e³ > 20\", perhaps there are no specific assumptions beyond the definition of e. But the format requires listing assumptions. Maybe the problem has no assumptions, but according to the example, even if the original problem didn't state assumptions, they were extracted. Wait, the example's original problem had \"for every integer n\", so the formatted assumption is \"n is an integer\". Therefore, in the current problem, if there are no stated conditions, maybe there are no assumptions. But the user's example included assumptions even if they were part of the problem's universal statement. So perhaps in this case, since there are no variables or conditions, the assumption section is empty. However, the example's problem had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem statement, it was \"for every integer n\", so maybe there was a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the original problem in the example had a different problem where n needed to be divisible by 7. Maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Anyway, regardless, for the current problem, the task is to structure the problem as per the example. Given that the example's problem included assumptions that were part of the original problem's statement, here, if there are no variables or conditions, perhaps the assumption section is empty. But the format requires it. Alternatively, maybe there's an implicit assumption that e is the base of the natural logarithm. Let me check the user's example again. In the example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n...\", which became the assumption \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like the original problem was perhaps different. Maybe there was a typo. For example, maybe the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n divisible by 7...\", and the formatted problem's assumption reflects that. But in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems inconsistent. Therefore, perhaps the example is incorrect. However, since the user provided that example, I need to follow it. Therefore, for the current problem, even though the problem is \"Show that e³ > 20\" without any stated assumptions, perhaps the assumption section should list any implicit assumptions. But since there's no variable or condition, maybe it's empty. However, the user's example included assumptions even when the problem was about a universal statement. Therefore, in the absence of variables, perhaps the assumption section is empty, but the format requires it. But the example shows that even if the problem is general, the assumption is listed. Therefore, perhaps for this problem, the assumption section is empty, but since the format requires an assumption line, maybe we need to write \"None\" or similar. But looking at the user's example, they listed two assumptions. Alternatively, maybe the problem has no assumptions, so the Assumption section is empty. However, the format requires \"Assumption: ...\". Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to list any assumptions even if they are definitions. For example, assuming that e is the base of the natural logarithm. But that's a definition, not an assumption. Alternatively, maybe there are no assumptions, and the problem is standalone. Since the example included assumptions even for universal statements, but in this problem, there's no variable, perhaps there are no assumptions. But the user's example shows that assumptions are listed line by line. Therefore, perhaps in this case, since there are no variables or conditions, the Assumption section is empty. However, the format requires \"Assumption: ...\". Maybe write \"None.\" But the example didn't do that. Alternatively, maybe it's better to leave it out. Wait, the user's example included assumptions even when the problem was general, so in this case, since there are no variables, perhaps there are no assumptions to list. Therefore, the Assumption section would be empty, but according to the format, it must be present. Hmm. This is a bit confusing. Let me think again. The user's instruction says: \"Assumption: <All the assumptions of the problem should be listed line by line. Each assumption addresses only one property or condition, applied to one object>\". So if the problem has no assumptions (i.e., it's a general proof without any conditions), then the Assumption section is empty. But in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", which was translated into an assumption \"n is an integer\", even though that's part of the problem's statement. So in this current problem, since there are no variables, the assumption section is empty. But how to represent that? The example didn't have an empty assumption section. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, which became an assumption. Therefore, in the current problem, maybe the assumption is that e is the exponential constant. But that's not an assumption; it's a definition. Alternatively, perhaps there are no assumptions, but according to the format, we need to list them. The user's example shows that even the universal quantifier is converted into an assumption. Therefore, perhaps in this problem, since there are no variables, the assumption section is empty. However, the user's example might have had a different structure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to show e³ >20 under the assumption that e is defined as the sum of the series 1 + 1/1! + 1/2! + ..., but that's part of the definition. Alternatively, the problem might assume that we can use certain approximations of e. But the problem as stated doesn't specify any assumptions. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is:\n\nAssumption: [None explicitly stated; the problem is to prove the inequality for the mathematical constant e.]\n\nBut according to the example, we need to list each assumption line by line. Since there are no explicit assumptions, maybe the Assumption line is empty. But in the example, even the universal quantifier was listed as an assumption. Therefore, perhaps in this case, since there are no variables, there are no assumptions. But the format requires the Assumption section. In the example, the original problem had a variable n, so the assumption was about n. Here, there's no variable, so perhaps there are no assumptions. Therefore, maybe write:\n\nAssumption:  \nProblem: Show that \\( e^3 > 20 \\).\n\nBut the example had two assumptions listed. Alternatively, maybe the problem's assumption is that e is the base of the natural logarithm. But that's a definition. The problem is to show an inequality involving e. So perhaps there are no assumptions beyond standard mathematical definitions. Therefore, the Assumption section is empty, but according to the format, it's required. Therefore, maybe we can write:\n\nAssumption:  \nProblem: Show that \\( e^3 > 20 \\).\n\nBut in the example, the Assumption line had bullet points. If there are no assumptions, perhaps leave it empty. However, the user's example didn't have an empty assumption. Maybe the user expects that even if there are no assumptions, we put \"None.\" But the example didn't do that. Alternatively, maybe in the absence of assumptions, we omit the Assumption line. But the format requires it. Hmm. Given the confusion, I think the safest way is to follow the example's structure. In the example, the problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91 for every integer n, so the assumption was n is an integer. Therefore, in the current problem, since there are no variables or conditions, perhaps the assumption section is empty, but according to the example's structure, maybe we need to list any underlying assumptions. However, since there's no variable, perhaps there are none. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:  \nProblem: Show that \\( e^3 > 20 \\).\n\nBut in the example, the Assumption section had two bullet points. To match that, perhaps we can list the definition of e as an assumption, but that's not an assumption. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that e is the exponential function evaluated at 1. But again, that's a definition. Therefore, perhaps there are no assumptions to list, and the Assumption line is empty. However, the example includes assumptions even when they are part of the problem's universal statement. Since this problem doesn't have any variables, the Assumption section is empty. Therefore, the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption:  \nProblem: Show that \\( e^3 > 20 \\).\n\nBut the example's formatting included bullet points under Assumption. Maybe in this case, since there are no assumptions, we just list nothing. However, the user's example shows that even if the problem's assumptions are part of the original statement, they are listed. So perhaps in this case, since there's no variable, the Assumption line is empty. So the formatted answer would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nProblem: Show that \\( e^3 > 20 \\).\n###\n\nBut according to the example, the Assumption section has each assumption line by line. If there are none, maybe it's left blank. Alternatively, maybe the user expects that the problem itself is restructured without the context from the question. The original question on Math Stack Exchange includes a lot of context about different methods, but the task is to filter unrelated information and structure the problem. So the actual problem is to show that e³ > 20. There are no stated assumptions. Therefore, the Assumption section is empty. However, in the example, the assumptions were taken from the problem's universal statement. But in this case, the problem is a direct inequality without variables. Hence, no assumptions. So the formatted problem should have an empty Assumption section. But according to the user's example, the Assumption line is present with bullet points. Perhaps in this case, since there are no assumptions, we just leave the Assumption line with no bullets. So:\n\nAssumption:  \nProblem: Show that \\( e^3 > 20 \\).\n\nYes, that seems correct. The original problem doesn't have any assumptions beyond the definition of e, which is a standard mathematical constant. Therefore, no explicit assumptions are needed.",
