    "Content": "Recall Prouhet–Tarry–Escott problem . Its solution shows that certain sums of powers of integers can be made to vanish simultaneously if their signs are chosen to follow the Thue–Morse sequence , e.g. $$\\sum_{k=0}^{2^4-1}(-1)^{\\sigma_2(k)}\\,k^n=0\\quad\\text{for}\\;n<4,\\quad\\text{i.e.}\\\\\n\\small\n\\begin{array}{l}\n 0^1+3^1+5^1+6^1+9^1+10^1+12^1+15^1=1^1+2^1+4^1+7^1+8^1+11^1+13^1+14^1 \\\\\n 0^2+3^2+5^2+6^2+9^2+10^2+12^2+15^2=1^2+2^2+4^2+7^2+8^2+11^2+13^2+14^2 \\\\\n 0^3+3^3+5^3+6^3+9^3+10^3+12^3+15^3=1^3+2^3+4^3+7^3+8^3+11^3+13^3+14^3, \\\\\n\\end{array}$$ where $\\sigma_2(k)$ is the sum of digits of $k$ in base-2 . I am interested in sums of powers of a similar form, but with larger exponents (such that the sum does not vanish anymore). I was able to make a few conjectures: $$\\begin{align}\n&\\sum _{k=0}^{2^n-1} (-1)^{\\sigma _2(k)}\\, k^{n+2}\\stackrel{\\color{gray}?}=\\frac{2^{\\binom{n}{2}}}{36}\\, (-1)^n\\, \\left(2^n-1\\right)\\, \\left(5\\times2^n-4\\right)\\, (n+2)!\\\\\n\\\\\n&\\sum _{k=0}^{2^n-1} (-1)^{\\sigma _2(k)}\\,k^{n+3}\\stackrel{\\color{gray}?}=\\frac{2^{\\binom{n}{2}}}{72}\\,(-1)^n \\,\\left(2^n-1\\right)^2\\,\\left(2\\times2^n-1\\right)\\,(n+3)!\\\\\n\\\\\n&\\small\\sum _{k=0}^{2^n-1} (-1)^{\\sigma_2(k)}\\,k^{n+4}\\stackrel{\\color{gray}?}=\\frac{2^{\\binom{n}{2}}}{32400}\\,(-1)^n\\,\\left(2^n-1\\right)\\,\\left(143\\!\\times\\! 8^n-307\\!\\times\\!4^n+193\\!\\times\\! 2^n-32\\right)\\,(n+4)!\\end{align}$$ This pattern seems to continue within increasingly complicated polynomials of $2^n$ on the right-hand side. Can you suggest an approach to prove these, and to find a more general formula for an arbitrary exponent $k^{n+p}$ ?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The exponential generating function for $S_{n,m}=\\displaystyle\\sum_{k=0}^{2^n-1}(-1)^{\\sigma_2(k)}k^m$ (w.r.t. $m$ ) is $$\\sum_{m=0}^\\infty S_{n,m}\\frac{x^m}{m!}=\\sum_{k=0}^{2^n-1}(-1)^{\\sigma_2(k)}e^{kx}=\\prod_{k=0}^{n-1}(1-e^{2^k x})=2^{n(n-1)/2}(-x)^n\\exp\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}f(2^k x),$$ where $$f(x)=\\log\\frac{e^x-1}{x}=\\sum_{m=1}^\\infty\\frac{B_m^+}{m}\\frac{x^m}{m!}$$ using the Bernoulli numbers (look at $f'(x)$ to see the expansion). Thus, \\begin{align*}\nS_{n,n+p}&=(-1)^n 2^{n(n-1)/2}(n+p)!\\ A_p(2^n),\n\\\\A_p(a)&=[x^p]\\exp\\sum_{m=1}^\\infty\\frac{a^m-1}{2^m-1}\\frac{B_m^+}{m}\\frac{x^m}{m!}.\n\\end{align*} This gives an algorithmic way to compute $S_{n,n+p}$ for any fixed $p$ . Continuing your table, \\begin{align*}\n  A_0(a)&=1\n\\\\2A_1(a)&=a-1\n\\\\36A_2(a)&=(a-1)(5a-4)\n\\\\72A_3(a)&=(a-1)^2(2a-1)\n\\\\32400A_4(a)&=(a-1)(143a^3-307a^2+193a-32)\n\\\\64800A_5(a)&=(a-1)^2(2a-1)(19a^2-24a+2)\n\\\\85730400A_6(a)&=(a-1)(5765a^5-19372a^4+22670a^3-10405a^2+1355a+32)\n\\\\342921600A_7(a)&=(a-1)^2(2a-1)(1166a^4-2850a^3+1715a^2+60a-1)\n\\end{align*} Observe that $A_p(a)$ is always divisible by $a-1$ , and even by $(a-1)^2(2a-1)$ if $p>1$ is odd (because of $B_m^+=0$ for odd $m>1$ , and [the g.f. of] $A_p(1/2)$ in closed form).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual mathematics professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. First, I need to read the original question from Math Stack Exchange carefully.\n\nThe original question talks about sums of integer powers similar to the Prouhet–Tarry–Escott problem. The user mentions that the solution involves the Thue–Morse sequence, where sums of powers vanish for exponents less than a certain number. They then provide conjectured formulas for sums where the exponent is n+2, n+3, n+4, etc., and ask for an approach to prove these and find a general formula for arbitrary exponents k^{n+p}.\n\nNow, I need to filter out the unrelated information. The example given in the user's query includes assumptions about the integer n and divisibility by 7, but in this problem, the assumptions are different. The key elements here are the use of the Thue–Morse sequence (indicated by (-1)^{σ₂(k)} where σ₂(k) is the sum of digits in base 2), the summation from k=0 to 2^n -1, and the specific conjectures for exponents n+p.\n\nSo, the assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The summation is over k from 0 to 2^n -1.\n2. The terms in the sum are multiplied by (-1) raised to the sum of the binary digits of k (σ₂(k)).\n3. The exponents in the conjectures are n + p where p is 2, 3, 4, etc.\n4. The problem is about proving the conjectured formulas and finding a general formula for arbitrary p.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement in the example was structured with \"Assumption\" and \"Problem\". The user wants me to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. \n\nLooking at the original problem:\n\n- The sums are from k=0 to 2^n -1.\n- The sign is determined by (-1)^{σ₂(k)}, where σ₂(k) is the sum of binary digits of k (Thue–Morse sequence).\n- The exponents are n + 2, n + 3, n + 4, etc.\n- The conjectured equalities have specific expressions involving 2^n, factorials, and polynomials of 2^n.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n1. The summation is over k from 0 to 2^n -1.\n2. Each term is multiplied by (-1)^{σ₂(k)}, where σ₂(k) is the sum of the binary digits of k.\n3. The exponents in the sum are n + p for integers p ≥ 2.\n4. The conjectured formulas for specific p (2,3,4) are given with polynomials in 2^n and factorials.\n\nBut the problem is to prove these conjectures and find a general formula for arbitrary p. However, the user's example only lists the problem part as \"Prove that...\", so perhaps in this case, the problem is to prove the conjectured formulas and find a general formula for an arbitrary exponent k^{n+p}.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions should list all the conditions given. Let me check the example again:\n\nOriginal example problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted assumptions were that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the user had \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted assumption, they added that n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted version adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps the example is incorrect? Or maybe the user intended to restructure the problem with some hidden assumptions? Wait, maybe the original problem actually had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the way it was written was confusing. Hmm. But regardless, in the example, the formatted problem lists assumptions, which might be the actual conditions needed, even if the original problem didn't state them. Wait, maybe that example was a mistake, but I need to follow the current problem.\n\nWait, maybe the user in their example made an error. Let me check:\n\nOriginal problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems like adding an assumption not present in the original problem. But perhaps the original problem had a typo, or maybe the user restructured it incorrectly. But regardless, I need to process the current problem as per the user's instruction.\n\nSo for the current problem, the user on Math Stack Exchange is interested in sums similar to Prouhet–Tarry–Escott, using Thue-Morse signs, with exponents higher than n, leading to conjectured formulas. The task is to prove these and find a general formula.\n\nSo, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The sum is taken over k from 0 to 2^n - 1.\n- Each term is multiplied by (-1)^{σ₂(k)}, where σ₂(k) is the sum of binary digits of k.\n- The exponents in the sum are n + p for integers p ≥ 2.\n- The conjectured expressions for specific p (2,3,4) involve polynomials of 2^n, factorials, and constants.\n\nBut the problem is asking to prove these conjectures and suggest a general approach for arbitrary p. So, in the formatted problem, the problem statement should be to prove the conjectured formulas and find a general formula for an arbitrary exponent k^{n+p}.\n\nSo structuring it:\n\nAssumptions:\nEach line is one property applied to one object.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nThe summation index $k$ ranges from $0$ to $2^n - 1$,\nEach term in the sum is multiplied by $(-1)^{\\sigma_2(k)}$ where $\\sigma_2(k)$ is the sum of the binary digits of $k$,\nThe exponents in the sum are of the form $n + p$ for integers $p \\geq 2$,\nConjectured formulas for $p=2$, $p=3$, and $p=4$ involve specific polynomials of $2^n$, factorials, and constants.\n\nProblem:\nProve the conjectured formulas for the sums $\\sum _{k=0}^{2^n-1} (-1)^{\\sigma _2(k)}\\, k^{n+p}$ when $p=2$, $3$, $4$, and find a general formula for arbitrary $p$.\n\nBut wait, the problem in the original post also asks for an approach to prove these and find a more general formula. So the problem is twofold: prove the conjectures and find a general formula.\n\nI need to check if the assumptions are correctly listed, each on a separate line, addressing one property.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key assumptions are:\n\n- For integers $n$ and $p$ with $p \\geq 2$,\n- The sum is $\\sum_{k=0}^{2^n -1} (-1)^{\\sigma_2(k)} k^{n+p}$,\n- $\\sigma_2(k)$ is the sum of the binary digits of $k$.\n\nBut the conjectures are specific to $p=2,3,4$ with given expressions, and the problem is to prove these and generalize.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n$n$ is a non-negative integer,\n$p$ is an integer such that $p \\geq 2$,\nThe sum is taken over $k$ from $0$ to $2^n - 1$,\nEach term in the sum is multiplied by $(-1)^{\\sigma_2(k)}$ where $\\sigma_2(k)$ is the sum of the binary digits of $k$,\nThe exponent in the sum is $k^{n+p}$,\nConjectured formulas exist for $p=2$, $p=3$, and $p=4$ as given.\n\nProblem:\nProve the conjectured formulas for $p=2$, $p=3$, and $p=4$, and find a general formula for the sum $\\sum _{k=0}^{2^n-1} (-1)^{\\sigma _2(k)}\\,k^{n+p}$ for arbitrary $p$.\n\nBut I need to check if each assumption is one line, one condition. The original example had two assumptions: n is integer, n divisible by 7. So each assumption is a separate line.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions here would be:\n\nAssumption:\n$k$ ranges from $0$ to $2^n - 1$ in the summation,\nEach term in the summation is multiplied by $(-1)^{\\sigma_2(k)}$,\n$\\sigma_2(k)$ is the sum of the binary digits of $k$,\nThe exponent of $k$ in the summation is $n + p$ where $p \\geq 2$,\nConjectured expressions for specific values of $p$ are provided.\n\nProblem:\nProve the conjectured formulas for $p = 2, 3, 4$ and determine a general formula for the sum $\\sum_{k=0}^{2^n -1} (-1)^{\\sigma_2(k)} k^{n+p}$ for arbitrary $p$.\n\nBut the user's example has the problem part as \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91\". So here, the problem is to prove the conjectures and find a general formula. So perhaps the problem is stated as:\n\nProblem:\nProve the conjectured formulas for the sums when the exponent is $n+2$, $n+3$, and $n+4$, and find a general formula for an arbitrary exponent $k^{n+p}$.\n\nAlternatively, more precisely:\n\nProblem:\nProve the conjectured equalities for the sums $\\sum_{k=0}^{2^n -1} (-1)^{\\sigma_2(k)} k^{n+2}$, $\\sum_{k=0}^{2^n -1} (-1)^{\\sigma_2(k)} k^{n+3}$, $\\sum_{k=0}^{2^n -1} (-1)^{\\sigma_2(k)} k^{n+4}$, and derive a general formula for $\\sum_{k=0}^{2^n -1} (-1)^{\\sigma_2(k)} k^{n+p}$ where $p$ is a non-negative integer.\n\nBut the original problem mentions \"Can you suggest an approach to prove these, and to find a more general formula for an arbitrary exponent $k^{n+p}$?\"\n\nSo the problem is to suggest an approach to prove the conjectures and find a general formula.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe summation $\\sum_{k=0}^{2^n -1} (-1)^{\\sigma_2(k)} k^{n+p}$ is considered,\n$\\sigma_2(k)$ denotes the sum of the binary digits of $k$,\n$n$ is a non-negative integer,\n$p$ is a positive integer such that $p \\geq 2$,\nConjectured expressions are provided for $p=2$, $p=3$, and $p=4$.\n\nProblem:\nProve the conjectured formulas for $p=2$, $p=3$, and $p=4$, and find a general formula for the sum $\\sum_{k=0}^{2^n -1} (-1)^{\\sigma_2(k)} k^{n+p}$ for arbitrary $p$.\n\nBut to adhere strictly to the example, each assumption is one line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe summation is over $k$ from $0$ to $2^n - 1$,\nEach term in the summation is multiplied by $(-1)^{\\sigma_2(k)}$,\n$\\sigma_2(k)$ is the sum of the binary digits of $k$,\nThe exponent in each term is $k^{n + p}$,\n$p$ is an integer satisfying $p \\geq 2$,\nConjectured formulas for $p = 2$, $p = 3$, and $p = 4$ are given.\n\nProblem:\nProve the conjectured formulas for $p = 2$, $p = 3$, and $p = 4$, and find a general formula for the sum $\\sum_{k=0}^{2^n -1} (-1)^{\\sigma_2(k)} k^{n+p}$ for arbitrary $p$.\n\nYes, this seems correct. Each assumption is one line, addressing one condition or property.",
