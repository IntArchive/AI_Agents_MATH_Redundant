    "Content": "For some collection of sets $A$, let $\\sigma(A)$ denote the $\\sigma$-algebra generated by $A$. Let $C$ be some collection of subsets of a set $Y$, and let $f$ be a function from some set $X$ to $Y$. I want to prove: $$f^{-1}(\\sigma(C))=\\sigma(f^{-1}(C))$$ I could prove that \n$$\\sigma(f^{-1}(C)) \\subset f^{-1}(\\sigma(C))$$ \nsince complements and unions are 'preserved' by function inverse. But how do I go the other way? EDIT: One way to go the other way would be to argue that any set in $\\sigma(C)$ must be built by repeatedly applying the complement, union and intersection operations to elements of $C$ and all these operations are preserved when taking the inverse. The problem I am facing with the approach is formalizing the word \"repeatedly\". [not-homework]",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Yes, we can use transfinite induction to prove this (formalizing the word \"repeatedly\"). That would be the bottom-up approach. There is also a top-down approach, using the characterization of $\\sigma(C)$ as the smallest $\\sigma$ -algebra containing $C$ . A key fact here is the the preimage operation commutes with all the set algebra operations: if $f \\colon X \\to Y$ then $f^{-1}(A \\cup B) = f^{-1}(A) \\cup f^{-1}(B)$ $f^{-1}(A \\cap B) = f^{-1}(A) \\cap f^{-1}(B)$ $f^{-1}(A - B) = f^{-1}(A) - f^{-1}(B)$ . In particular $f^{-1}(Y - A) = X - f^{-1}(A)$ . and so forth. So $f^{-1}\\colon P(Y) \\to P(X)$ is a lattice homomorphism on the powerset lattices, to use that terminology.  More importantly for us, the preimage operation even commutes with infinite unions and intersections. To show that $f^{−1}(\\sigma(C)) \\subseteq \\sigma(f^{−1}(C))$ , you could follow this strategy: Show that $f^{-1}(C) \\subseteq \\sigma(f^{-1}(C))$ Show that if $f^{-1}(A_i) \\in \\sigma(f^{-1}(C))$ for $i \\in \\omega$ then $f^{-1}(\\bigcup A_i) \\in \\sigma(f^{-1}(C))$ Show that if $f^{-1}(A) \\in \\sigma(f^{-1}(C))$ then $f^{-1}(Y - A) \\in \\sigma(f^{-1}(C))$ The point here is that, if we let $D$ be the collection of sets $A$ such that $f^{-1}(A) \\in \\sigma(f^{-1}(C))$ , then $D$ is itself a $\\sigma$ algebra containing $C$ , which means $\\sigma(C) \\subseteq D$ . But by the definition of $D$ this means $f^{-1}(\\sigma(C)) \\subseteq \\sigma(f^{-1}(C))$ . None of the three bullets will require taking forward images under $f$ . For example, for the third one, let $A$ be as stated. This means $f^{-1}(A)$ is in $\\sigma(f^{-1}(C))$ , which means that $X - f^{-1}(A)$ is also in $\\sigma(f^{-1}(C))$ . But $f^{-1}(Y - A)$ is exactly $X - f^{-1}(A)$ , so we see that $f^{-1}(Y - A)$ is indeed in $\\sigma(f^{-1}(C))$ . The underlying point here is that the entire proof is algebraic and that a more general theorem is true: you can replace $f^{-1}$ with any other homomorphism of the powerset lattices that preserves countable unions.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to structure the Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the original problem, the goal is to prove that the preimage of the generated σ-algebra equals the σ-algebra generated by the preimage of the collection. The user mentions a function f from X to Y and a collection C of subsets of Y. The key assumptions here are about the objects involved: the function f, the collection C, and the σ-algebras generated. \n\nThe assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property. So, first, C is a collection of subsets of Y. Then, f is a function from X to Y. Also, the problem involves σ-algebras generated by these collections, which are σ(C) and σ(f^{-1}(C)). Each of these points is a separate assumption.\n\nThe problem statement itself is the equality between the preimage of the generated σ-algebra and the generated σ-algebra of the preimages. The user already provided part of the proof but needs the reverse inclusion. The challenge is formalizing the \"repeatedly\" applied operations. However, for structuring, the problem is simply to prove that f^{-1}(σ(C)) equals σ(f^{-1}(C)).\n\nI should check if there are any hidden assumptions. The problem mentions that complements and unions are preserved under inverse images, which is a known property, so maybe that's part of the reasoning but not an assumption. The key assumptions are about the definitions of the objects involved. So the structured problem should list C as a collection of subsets of Y, f as a function from X to Y, and then the problem is to prove the equality of the two σ-algebras.\n\nWait, the original problem didn't specify any restrictions on C or f, like measurability. So the assumptions are straightforward: the collection C consists of subsets of Y, and f is a function between sets X and Y. Each of these is a separate line in the assumptions.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption: C is a collection of subsets of Y,\nAssumption: f is a function from X to Y,\nProblem: Prove that $$f^{-1}(\\sigma(C)) = \\sigma(f^{-1}(C))$$.\n\nYes, that seems right. The example given in the user's instruction included assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions are about the nature of C and f. The problem statement is the equality of the two σ-algebras. The user's own steps and the edit about formalizing the \"repeatedly\" applied operations are part of their thought process but not part of the structured problem. The structured problem should capture the essential assumptions and the problem to solve.",
