    "Content": "I have to give a combinatorial proof of $$\\sum_{k=1}^nk{n\\choose k}^2=n{2n-1\\choose n}.$$ I find it difficult to solve such problems. I'm not a brilliant person and never will be so I need to have algorithms to solve most problems. Usually I won't just \"see\" solutions unless I have a thorough enough understanding of a theory. This is also the case here. I know what the symbols mean, but I don't see what I should count and how to obtain the identity. I think the right-hand side counts $n$-element subsets of a $(2n-1)$-element set with one element chosen to be \"special\". I think I should find a partition of the set of such subsets into $n$ parts so that the left-hand side is the sum of the cardinalities of the parts. Is there $n$ of anything on the right-hand side? Well, there are $n$ choices for the \"special\" elements, but only after I've chosen the $n$-element subset. Otherwise I can choose the \"special element\" in $2n-1$ ways. This is a homework problem so I probably shouldn't ask for a full solution. But I would like to have some guidelines for approaching such problems, perhaps based on this example.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "It seems easier to look at the left-hand side : $\\sum \\binom n k ^2 = \\binom {2n} n$ is the number of ways to choose $n$ elements out of a set $X$ of $2n$ elements, where we are given a partition $X = X_1 \\cup X_2$ with $\\# X_i = n$. Next, $\\sum k \\binom n k ^2$ is the number of ways to do this and then choose a special element among the ones chosen in $X_1$. So, reversing the order of the choices (choose the special element first), then forgetting as much as possible about the partition, you get that is the number of ways to pick one special element in $X_1$ and then pick $n-1$ other elements in $X$. Then it shouldn't be too hard to explain why this is equal to the right-hand side.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about proving a combinatorial identity: the sum from k=1 to n of k times the square of the binomial coefficient (n choose k) equals n times (2n-1 choose n). \n\nFirst, I need to list all assumptions. The user's example had assumptions that were specific conditions on the variables. Here, the problem is a combinatorial identity, so the assumptions would likely be about the variables and their properties. Let's see:\n\nThe problem involves n and k. The summation is from k=1 to n, so k is an integer in that range. The binomial coefficients (n choose k) suggest that n is a positive integer, and k is a non-negative integer less than or equal to n. However, since the summation starts at k=1, k is at least 1 here. The right-hand side also involves n and (2n-1 choose n), which requires that 2n-1 is at least n, so n is at least 1.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n- n is a positive integer.\n- k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n.\n- The binomial coefficients are defined in the standard combinatorial way.\n\nBut wait, the user's example only listed the essential conditions. Maybe here, the main assumption is that n is a positive integer, and the problem is to prove the identity combinatorially. The other parts (like k being between 1 and n) are part of the problem statement's summation limits, so they might not need to be in the assumptions. The example had assumptions that were conditions on n (like being an integer and divisible by 7), but in this case, the identity holds for any positive integer n. So perhaps the only assumption is that n is a positive integer.\n\nLooking at the user's example, they listed each assumption line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. Here, the problem is to prove an identity for all positive integers n. So the assumption would just be that n is a positive integer. The rest of the problem is the identity itself.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum_{k=1}^n k \\binom{n}{k}^2 = n \\binom{2n-1}{n}$$ using a combinatorial argument.\n\nI need to check if the user's example included any other implicit assumptions. In the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption added \"n is divisible by 7\", which was part of the original problem's conditions. Wait, no, the original problem in the example was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem's assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect because the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect? Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\"\n\nFormatted assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption adds that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Unless the original problem was mistyped. Maybe there was a typo and the user intended to show an example where the assumption was added. But regardless, in the current problem, the user's example might have had a mistake, but for the current problem, we need to follow the instructions: filter unrelated information and structure the problem with assumptions.\n\nIn the current Math Stack Exchange question, the problem is to prove the combinatorial identity. The user mentions giving a combinatorial proof, so the assumptions are about combinatorial interpretations. However, according to the user's example, assumptions are the conditions on the variables. So in this case, the key assumption is that n is a positive integer. The problem is to prove the identity combinatorially. The rest of the user's thoughts about how to approach it (like choosing a special element, partitioning subsets) are part of their thought process, not part of the problem's assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum_{k=1}^n k \\binom{n}{k}^2 = n \\binom{2n-1}{n}$$ using a combinatorial argument.\n\nI think that's correct. The assumptions are minimal here, just that n is a positive integer, which is necessary for the binomial coefficients to make sense. The problem is the identity itself, with the requirement of a combinatorial proof.",
