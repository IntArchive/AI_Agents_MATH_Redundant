    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so the user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me start by reading the original problem carefully.\n\nThe title is \"Is the sum of positive definite matrices still positive definite?\" and the question body says: \"I have two symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices. I would like to prove that the sum of these two matrices is still SPD. Symmetry is obvious, but what about PD-ness? Any clues, please?\"\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The user mentions two matrices. Let's break down the properties each matrix has. The first assumption is that there are two matrices. Each of them is symmetric, and each is positive definite. So each matrix has two properties: symmetry and positive definiteness. But according to the example, each assumption line should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So I need to separate these.\n\nWait, the example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. So here, for each matrix, their symmetry and positive definiteness are separate properties. However, the problem states \"two symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices\", so each matrix has both properties. Therefore, each matrix has two assumptions: being symmetric and being positive definite. Since there are two matrices, each with two properties, that would be four assumptions? But maybe the problem is referring to two matrices each of which is SPD. So maybe the assumption is that each matrix is SPD. But the problem might not require splitting SPD into symmetry and PD, but maybe the user wants each property listed separately. Let's check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption includes \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7. Wait, the example's original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number [...] is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\", which seems like an error. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. But perhaps the example is part of the user's instruction. So maybe the user made a mistake in the example, but I need to follow the instruction regardless.\n\nBut back to the current problem. The user's instruction says: \"All the assumptions of the problem should be listed line by line. Each assumption addresses only one property or condition, applied to one object.\" So for each matrix, we need to list each property separately.\n\nSo for the two matrices, let's say Matrix A and Matrix B. Then the assumptions would be:\n\n- Matrix A is symmetric.\n- Matrix A is positive definite.\n- Matrix B is symmetric.\n- Matrix B is positive definite.\n\nBut the problem statement in the example didn't name the matrices, so maybe we just refer to them as \"the first matrix\" and \"the second matrix\".\n\nAlternatively, since the problem says \"two symmetric positive definite matrices\", each matrix has both properties. So the assumptions are:\n\n- The first matrix is symmetric.\n- The first matrix is positive definite.\n- The second matrix is symmetric.\n- The second matrix is positive definite.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem might consider \"symmetric positive definite\" as a single condition (SPD), but according to the user's example, each property should be split. For instance, in the example, the problem was about divisibility by 91, which factors into 13 and 7. But the user split the assumptions into n being an integer and n divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem didn't have the n divisible by 7. That's confusing. Maybe the example is incorrect, but the user wants me to split properties even if they are combined in the problem statement.\n\nGiven that, the problem states two SPD matrices. So each matrix has two properties: symmetry and positive definiteness. Therefore, each of these should be separate assumptions. So four assumptions in total: two matrices, each with two properties.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that their sum is still SPD. However, the user in the original question says \"Symmetry is obvious, but what about PD-ness?\" So the problem is about proving the sum is positive definite, given that the individual matrices are SPD. So symmetry is considered already handled, but the user is asking about positive definiteness. However, in the problem statement, should we include both symmetry and PD in the problem? Or just PD since symmetry is obvious?\n\nBut according to the user's example, the problem line restates the entire problem as presented, but with the assumptions split out. So in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem lists n is an integer and n is divisible by 7 as assumptions, and the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because 91 is 7*13, but the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7. So perhaps the example has an error. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instruction.\n\nSo applying that to the current problem: the original problem is to prove that the sum of two SPD matrices is SPD. The user already recognizes that symmetry is obvious but is asking about positive definiteness. However, in the formatted problem, we need to list all assumptions, each as a single property on one object.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The first matrix is symmetric.\n- The first matrix is positive definite.\n- The second matrix is symmetric.\n- The second matrix is positive definite.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user wants to prove the sum is SPD. But since SPD includes both symmetry and positive definiteness, but the user says symmetry is obvious, so maybe the problem is just to prove positive definiteness. However, the original problem's title is about the sum being positive definite, but the user's question is to prove the sum is SPD. So maybe the problem statement should be to prove that the sum is SPD, which includes symmetry and positive definiteness. But the user says symmetry is obvious, so perhaps the problem is to prove positive definiteness. However, the formatted problem should reflect the original question. The original question is to prove that the sum is SPD. So the problem statement should be \"Prove that the sum of two symmetric positive definite matrices is still symmetric positive definite.\" But since symmetry is obvious, maybe the problem is to prove positive definiteness. But the user's original question is to prove the sum is SPD, which includes both properties. However, the user says \"Symmetry is obvious, but what about PD-ness?\" So maybe the problem is to prove PD-ness, assuming the matrices are SPD. So in that case, the assumptions would be the two matrices are SPD, and the problem is to prove their sum is PD. But according to the user's format, each assumption must address only one property. Therefore, split SPD into symmetry and PD for each matrix.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nThe first matrix is symmetric.\nThe first matrix is positive definite.\nThe second matrix is symmetric.\nThe second matrix is positive definite.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the sum of the two matrices is symmetric positive definite.\n\nBut the original question is phrased as \"is the sum still SPD\", so the problem is to prove that the sum is SPD. But since SPD requires both symmetry and PD, and symmetry is obvious, but the problem includes both. However, the user is asking for PD-ness. But according to the example, the problem line should restate the entire problem. So the problem line should be as the original question, but with assumptions filtered out. So the original problem is to prove the sum is SPD. The assumptions are the two matrices are each SPD. But according to the user's format, each assumption is split into separate lines. So the formatted problem would have four assumptions (symmetry and PD for each matrix), and the problem line is \"Prove that the sum of these two matrices is still SPD.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to prove the sum is positive definite, given that the matrices are SPD. Because symmetry is obvious. But the title asks if the sum is still positive definite, but the body mentions SPD. So the problem is to prove that the sum is SPD. So the problem line should be \"Prove that the sum of these two matrices is still symmetric positive definite.\"\n\nBut according to the example, the problem line is the original problem with the assumptions filtered out. In the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem lists n is an integer and n divisible by 7 as assumptions. Wait, that seems incorrect. Because the original problem didn't have the assumption that n is divisible by 7. It was for every integer n. So perhaps the example has a mistake, but the user wants us to follow the format regardless.\n\nBut given that, perhaps in this case, the problem is to prove the sum is SPD, with assumptions being each matrix is SPD. However, according to the user's instruction, split each property. So each matrix is symmetric and each is positive definite. Therefore, four assumptions.\n\nSo the final answer would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nThe first matrix is symmetric,\nThe first matrix is positive definite,\nThe second matrix is symmetric,\nThe second matrix is positive definite.\nProblem: \nProve that the sum of these two matrices is still symmetric positive definite.\n###\n\nAlternatively, the problem line could be phrased as \"Prove that the sum of these two matrices is still SPD,\" but since the acronym SPD was defined in the original question as symmetric positive definite, but in the formatted problem, we need to spell it out. So probably better to write \"symmetric positive definite\" in full.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the problem line is to prove the sum is still symmetric positive definite, with the four assumptions listed.",
