    "Content": "Let $p,q$ be primes and let $G$ be a group of order $p^2q^2$ , what's the best way to show $G$ is non-simple? I know it suffices to show that one of the Sylow-p or Sylow-q subgroup of $G$ is normal, but the counting elements argument doesn't work here since different Sylow subgroups may have non-trivial intersection.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "We may as well assume $p < q$. The number of Sylow $q$-subgroups is $1$ mod $q$ and divides $p^2$. So it is $1, p$, or $p^2$. We win if it's $1$ and it can't be $p$, so suppose it's $p^2$. But now $q \\mid p^2 - 1$, so $q \\mid p+1$ or $q \\mid p-1$. Thus $p = 2$ and $q = 3$. The case of order $36$ has been proved in an earlier question: No group of order 36 is simple",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to help the user by formatting the problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified structure. Let me first read through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe title is \"A group of order \\(p^2q^2\\) is never simple.\" The question states: Let \\(p, q\\) be primes and let \\(G\\) be a group of order \\(p^2q^2\\). The user wants to show \\(G\\) is non-simple and mentions that it suffices to show one of the Sylow-p or Sylow-q subgroups is normal. They note that counting elements might not work because Sylow subgroups could have non-trivial intersections.\n\nHmm, the task is to extract assumptions and the problem. The example given for the previous problem listed assumptions line by line, each addressing one property. Let me parse this.\n\nThe original problem mentions \\(p, q\\) are primes. So that's two separate assumptions: one for \\(p\\) being prime, another for \\(q\\). Then, \\(G\\) is a group of order \\(p^2q^2\\). So that's another assumption about \\(G\\)'s order. The problem itself is to show \\(G\\) is non-simple, i.e., not simple.\n\nWait, the example in the original instruction had an assumption that \\(n\\) is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, no. Let me check the example again. The original problem was to prove \\(A(n)\\) is divisible by 91 for every integer \\(n\\). The formatted problem had assumptions: \\(n\\) is an integer, \\(n\\) is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem didn't say \\(n\\) is divisible by 7. That seems like an error. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect?\n\nWait, the original problem in the example says \"for every integer \\(n\\)\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that \\(n\\) is divisible by 7. That's conflicting. Maybe the user made a mistake in their example? Or perhaps the example was intended to show how to structure even if the original problem had different conditions. Wait, perhaps the user wants to filter unrelated information. So maybe in the example, they took the original problem which had \"for every integer \\(n\\)\", but the answer needed to assume \\(n\\) is divisible by 7? That seems confusing. Wait, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer \\(n\\), the number [...] is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem's assumption includes that \\(n\\) is divisible by 7. That would make the problem statement contradictory. So maybe the example is wrong. Hmm. But perhaps the user intended to restructure the problem with some hidden assumptions. Maybe I need to just follow their format even if the example is inconsistent.\n\nBut regardless, the task here is to structure the given problem into Assumptions and Problem. So for the current problem about groups of order \\(p^2q^2\\), the assumptions are:\n\n- \\(p\\) is a prime.\n- \\(q\\) is a prime.\n- \\(G\\) is a group.\n- The order of \\(G\\) is \\(p^2 q^2\\).\n\nThe problem is to show that \\(G\\) is not simple.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"Let \\(p, q\\) be primes and let \\(G\\) be a group of order \\(p^2 q^2\\). What's the best way to show \\(G\\) is non-simple?\" So in the assumptions, we need to list each condition separately. So each line is one condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- \\(p\\) is a prime.\n- \\(q\\) is a prime.\n- \\(G\\) is a group.\n- The order of \\(G\\) is \\(p^2 q^2\\).\n\nProblem: Show that \\(G\\) is not simple.\n\nWait, but in the example, the user had added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (about \\(n\\) divisible by 7). But in this case, the original problem already states all the necessary assumptions. So perhaps we just list them as separate lines. The problem is to show non-simplicity.\n\nI think that's correct. The example given by the user might have been a mistake, but here, following the original problem's explicit conditions, we list each as separate assumptions. The problem is the main question.\n\nSo the formatted answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$p$ is a prime,\n$q$ is a prime,\n$G$ is a group,\nthe order of $G$ is $p^2 q^2$.\nProblem:\nShow that $G$ is non-simple.\n###",
