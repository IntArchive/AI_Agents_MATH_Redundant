    "Content": "This is an exercise from Stephen Abbott's Understanding Analysis . The hint it gives on how to solve it is not very clear, in my opinion, so I would like for a fresh set of eyes to go over it with me: pp 143 Exercise 5.3.4. (a) Supply the details for the proof of Cauchy's Generalized Mean Value Theorem (Theorem 5.3.5.). Theorem 5.3.5. (Generalized Mean Value Theorem). If $f$ and $g$ are continuous on the closed interval $[a,b]$ and differentiable on the open interval $(a,b)$, then there exists a point $c\\in(a,b)$ where$$[f(b)-f(a)]g'(c)=[g(b)-g(a)]f'(c).$$If $g'$ is never zero on $(a,b)$, then the conclusion can be stated as$$\\frac{f'(c)}{g'(c)}=\\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)}.$$ * Hint: This result follows by applying the Mean Value Theorem to the function *$$h(x)=[f(b)-f(a)]g(x)-[g(b)-g(a)]f(x)$$ First of all, I know that the Mean Value Theorem (MVT) states that if $f:[a,b]\\to\\mathbb{R}$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$, then there exists a point $c\\in(a,b)$ where$$f'(c)=\\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}.$$ If we assume that $h$ has the above properties, then applying the MVT to it, for some $c\\in(a,b)$, would yield$$h'(c)=\\frac{h(b)-h(a)}{b-a}=$$ $$\\frac{[f(b)-f(a)]g(b)-[g(b)-g(a)]f(b) \\quad - \\quad [f(b)-f(a)]g(a)+[g(b)-g(a)]f(a)}{b-a}=$$ $$[f(b)-f(a)]\\left(\\frac{g(b)-g(a)}{b-a}\\right) \\quad - \\quad[g(b)-g(a)]\\left(\\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}\\right)=$$ $$[f(b)-f(a)]g'(c) \\quad - \\quad [g(b)-g(a)]f'(c).$$This is the best I could achieve; I have no clue on how to reach the second equation in the above theorem. Do you guys have any ideas? Thanks in advance!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Note that \n$$\\begin{eqnarray}h(a)&=&[f(b)-f(a)]g(a)-[g(b)-g(a)]f(a)\\\\\n&=&f(b)g(a)-g(b)f(a)\\\\\n&=&[f(b)-f(a)]g(b)-[g(b)-g(a)]f(b)\\\\\n&=&h(b)\\end{eqnarray}$$\nand so $h'(c)=0$ for some point $c\\in (a,b)$. Then differentiate $h$ normally and note that this makes $c$ the desired point.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question according to the given format. Let me read through the original question carefully.\n\nThe user is asking about proving Cauchy's Generalized Mean Value Theorem as presented in Abbott's Understanding Analysis. The theorem states that if f and g are continuous on [a,b] and differentiable on (a,b), then there exists a point c in (a,b) where [f(b)-f(a)]g'(c) = [g(b)-g(a)]f'(c). Additionally, if g' is never zero on (a,b), the conclusion can be written as f'(c)/g'(c) = [f(b)-f(a)]/[g(b)-g(a)].\n\nThe user tried applying the MVT to the function h(x) = [f(b)-f(a)]g(x) - [g(b)-g(a)]f(x) and did some calculations but got stuck on reaching the second equation in the theorem.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem is about proving the theorem, so the assumptions are the conditions required for the theorem to hold. Let's list them:\n\n1. f is continuous on the closed interval [a, b].\n2. f is differentiable on the open interval (a, b).\n3. g is continuous on the closed interval [a, b].\n4. g is differentiable on the open interval (a, b).\n\nThese are the main assumptions for the existence of point c. Additionally, the second part of the theorem has an extra condition:\n\n5. g'(x) is never zero on (a, b).\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the user is asking to supply the details for the proof of the theorem. So the main problem is to prove the theorem given those assumptions. The second part (if g' is never zero) is a corollary of the main result when dividing both sides by g'(c), but the user's confusion is about reaching that conclusion.\n\nIn the example provided, the original problem had an extra assumption (n divisible by 7), but in this case, the theorem's assumptions are all listed in the problem statement. So I need to list each assumption line by line, each applying to one object. Let me check:\n\n- The function f is continuous on [a,b]. That's one assumption.\n- f is differentiable on (a,b). Second assumption.\n- Similarly for g: continuous on [a,b] and differentiable on (a,b). Third and fourth.\n- Then, for the second conclusion, the additional assumption is that g' is never zero on (a,b). That's the fifth assumption.\n\nBut the problem as presented is asking to prove the theorem, which includes both parts. However, the user's specific issue is about reaching the second equation (the ratio form) from the first conclusion. But according to the format, the problem section should state the problem as given. The original problem says \"Supply the details for the proof of Cauchy's Generalized Mean Value Theorem (Theorem 5.3.5.)\", which includes both parts. However, the user's confusion is about the second part, but the main problem is to prove the theorem as a whole.\n\nBut the example given in the instruction had the original problem mentioning that the number is divisible by 91, and the formatted problem listed the assumptions and restated the problem. Here, the problem is to prove the theorem, so the assumptions are those listed in the theorem's statement.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem had an incorrect assumption (n divisible by 7) but the actual problem didn't require that. Wait, no: in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems contradictory. Wait, looking back: the example's original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem listed an assumption that \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like an error. Because if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", then the assumption should just be \"n is an integer\". Adding \"n is divisible by 7\" is incorrect. But maybe there was a mistake in the example. Hmm.\n\nBut in any case, the user here is supposed to list the assumptions of the problem. So for the current problem, Cauchy's Generalized Mean Value Theorem, the assumptions are:\n\n1. f is continuous on [a, b].\n2. f is differentiable on (a, b).\n3. g is continuous on [a, b].\n4. g is differentiable on (a, b).\n\nThen the problem is to prove that there exists c ∈ (a, b) such that [f(b)-f(a)]g'(c) = [g(b)-g(a)]f'(c). Additionally, if g' is never zero, then the conclusion can be written as f'(c)/g'(c) = [f(b)-f(a)]/[g(b)-g(a)].\n\nBut the user's question is about applying the hint given (using the function h(x)) to reach the conclusion, specifically how to get the second equation (the ratio form) from the first. However, according to the instructions, the problem should be structured as per the original question. The original problem asks to supply the details for the proof of the theorem as stated. So the problem includes both parts: the existence of c with the equality, and the ratio form when g' is non-zero.\n\nBut when structuring the problem, we need to list the assumptions and the problem statement. So the assumptions are the four listed above. The problem is to prove the two conclusions. However, the additional part about g' never being zero is a condition for the second conclusion, so perhaps that's an assumption for that part. But in the theorem statement, the first conclusion holds under the four main assumptions, and the second conclusion (the ratio) holds under the additional assumption that g' is never zero. So perhaps the problem has two parts, but the user is asking about the proof in general.\n\nBut according to the format, the problem should be written as per the original question. The original problem says: \"Supply the details for the proof of Cauchy's Generalized Mean Value Theorem (Theorem 5.3.5.)\". So the problem is to prove the theorem as stated, which includes both conclusions. Therefore, the assumptions are the four for the first part, and the additional one for the second part. But in the problem statement, the theorem is presented with the two conclusions, the second one conditional on g' being non-zero.\n\nTherefore, in the assumptions, we need to list:\n\n1. f is continuous on [a, b].\n2. f is differentiable on (a, b).\n3. g is continuous on [a, b].\n4. g is differentiable on (a, b).\n5. For the second conclusion: g' is never zero on (a, b).\n\nBut since the problem is to prove the entire theorem, including both conclusions, the assumptions for each part must be listed. However, the format requires each assumption to be a single property applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- f is continuous on the closed interval [a, b].\n- f is differentiable on the open interval (a, b).\n- g is continuous on the closed interval [a, b].\n- g is differentiable on the open interval (a, b).\n- For the second conclusion: g'(x) ≠ 0 for all x in (a, b).\n\nBut in the problem statement, the second conclusion is a corollary under the additional assumption. However, the problem is to prove the theorem which includes both parts. So perhaps the problem is split into two parts: first proving the existence of c with the equality, and then under the additional assumption, restating the conclusion as the ratio. Therefore, the main problem is to prove the theorem as stated, with the two parts.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property. So the first four are the main assumptions. The fifth is an additional assumption for the second conclusion.\n\nHowever, in the problem statement, the user is to structure the problem as per the original question, which is to supply the proof for the theorem. Therefore, the problem statement is the theorem as given, and the assumptions are the four conditions for the first part. The second part is a consequence under an additional assumption.\n\nBut the way the theorem is written, it's all under the initial assumptions, with an added condition for the restated conclusion. So maybe the problem is:\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists a point c ∈ (a,b) where [f(b)-f(a)]g'(c) = [g(b)-g(a)]f'(c). Additionally, if g' is never zero on (a,b), prove that (f'(c))/(g'(c)) = (f(b)-f(a))/(g(b)-g(a)).\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are the four continuity and differentiability conditions for f and g, and then the additional assumption for the second part. But in the problem statement, the user is to structure the problem, not split it into parts. So perhaps the problem is as stated in the theorem, with both conclusions, and the assumptions are the four initial ones plus the fifth for the second part. But the problem is to prove the theorem, so the user must address both parts.\n\nHowever, the user's specific confusion is about reaching the second equation from the first. But when structuring the problem, we need to present it as per the original question, which is to supply the proof for the theorem as a whole.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- f is continuous on [a, b].\n- f is differentiable on (a, b).\n- g is continuous on [a, b].\n- g is differentiable on (a, b).\n- g' is never zero on (a, b).\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists a point c ∈ (a,b) where [f(b)-f(a)]g'(c) = [g(b)-g(a)]f'(c). Additionally, show that if g' is never zero on (a,b), then (f'(c))/(g'(c)) = (f(b)-f(a))/(g(b)-g(a)).\n\nWait, but the fifth assumption (g' never zero) is only for the second part. So perhaps the problem should have the first four assumptions for the first part, and the fifth for the second part. However, the problem as stated in the theorem has both conclusions under the initial four assumptions, with the additional condition for the second conclusion. Therefore, the problem is to prove the entire theorem, which includes two conclusions under different assumptions.\n\nBut according to the example given, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n divisible by 7, but in the original problem statement, it was just for every integer n. So perhaps the example had an error. Therefore, in the current problem, to accurately list the assumptions, we need to separate them:\n\nAssumption:\n\n1. f is continuous on [a, b].\n2. f is differentiable on (a, b).\n3. g is continuous on [a, b].\n4. g is differentiable on (a, b).\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists a point c ∈ (a,b) where [f(b)-f(a)]g'(c) = [g(b)-g(a)]f'(c). Additionally, show that if g' is never zero on (a,b), then (f'(c))/(g'(c)) = (f(b)-f(a))/(g(b)-g(a)).\n\nBut the additional part about g' never zero is part of the problem's conclusion, not an assumption. Therefore, in the assumptions, we only list the conditions given for the theorem. The second part of the problem (the ratio form) is under an additional hypothesis, which is part of the problem statement but not an assumption for the entire theorem. Hence, the assumptions are the first four, and the problem includes proving both parts: the equality and the ratio under the extra condition.\n\nBut according to the problem's structure, the user must list all assumptions. Since the ratio part requires g' never zero, that should be listed as an assumption when addressing that part. However, in the original theorem, it's presented as two conclusions under the main assumptions plus an extra for the second. So perhaps:\n\nAssumptions for the first conclusion:\n\n1. f is continuous on [a, b].\n2. f is differentiable on (a, b).\n3. g is continuous on [a, b].\n4. g is differentiable on (a, b).\n\nAdditional assumption for the second conclusion:\n\n5. g' is never zero on (a, b).\n\nBut the problem is to prove both conclusions. Therefore, the problem statement includes both parts. So perhaps in the formatted problem, the assumptions include the first four, and the problem is to prove both parts, with the second part conditioned on g' being non-zero. However, the user's original question is about proving the theorem, which includes both parts, so the problem should reflect that.\n\nBut in the example, the problem was restated with the assumptions and the problem. So following that, for the current problem:\n\nAssumption:\nf is continuous on [a, b],\nf is differentiable on (a, b),\ng is continuous on [a, b],\ng is differentiable on (a, b),\ng' is never zero on (a, b).\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists a point c ∈ (a,b) where [f(b)-f(a)]g'(c) = [g(b)-g(a)]f'(c), and that (f'(c))/(g'(c)) = (f(b)-f(a))/(g(b)-g(a)).\n\nWait, but the additional assumption (g' never zero) is only for the second part. Therefore, the problem should be structured with two parts: first proving the equality under the first four assumptions, then the ratio under the additional fifth. But the original problem is to supply the proof for the theorem as stated, which includes both conclusions. Therefore, the correct way is to list the assumptions for each part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to prove the first conclusion under the first four assumptions, and the second conclusion under the first four plus the fifth. Therefore, the assumptions would be split. However, the problem statement in the theorem includes both, so the user needs to address both. But according to the format, the assumptions are all listed, and the problem is stated.\n\nBut considering the original problem statement, the theorem has two parts: the existence of c with the equality, and then the ratio form when g' is non-zero. Therefore, the assumptions for the entire theorem are the first four, and the additional one is for the second part. So perhaps in the formatted problem, the assumptions are the first four, and the problem is to prove the two conclusions, with the second one requiring the additional condition. However, the way to structure this is:\n\nAssumption:\nf is continuous on [a, b],\nf is differentiable on (a, b),\ng is continuous on [a, b],\ng is differentiable on (a, b).\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists a point c ∈ (a,b) where [f(b)-f(a)]g'(c) = [g(b)-g(a)]f'(c). Furthermore, show that if g' is never zero on (a,b), then (f'(c))/(g'(c)) = (f(b)-f(a))/(g(b)-g(a)).\n\nYes, this seems correct. The fifth assumption (g' never zero) is part of the problem's second part, not an initial assumption. So in the assumptions section, we list the four main ones, and the problem includes proving both conclusions, with the second one under the extra condition mentioned in the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nf is continuous on the closed interval [a, b],\nf is differentiable on the open interval (a, b),\ng is continuous on the closed interval [a, b],\ng is differentiable on the open interval (a, b).\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a point $c \\in (a, b)$ where $$[f(b)-f(a)]g'(c) = [g(b)-g(a)]f'(c).$$ Furthermore, show that if $g'$ is never zero on $(a, b)$, then $$\\frac{f'(c)}{g'(c)} = \\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)}.$$",
