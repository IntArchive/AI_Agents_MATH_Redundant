    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, the user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. The example provided shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then, the problem statement is to be written concisely.\n\nLooking at the original problem: It's an integral from 0 to 1 of a complicated expression involving arcsin, logarithms, and rational functions, multiplied by ln x over x^3 + x. The user conjectures that the integral equals -2G ln 2, where G is Catalan's constant. They want to know how to prove it.\n\nFirst, I need to identify any assumptions in the problem. The original problem states that the integral is conjectured to equal -2G ln2, and mentions that numerically it approximates a certain value. However, in the example given, the assumptions were about the variables involved (like n being an integer and divisible by 7). In this integral problem, the variables of integration are x from 0 to 1, which is standard. The integrand involves functions like arcsin(x), ln(x), etc., which are defined on the interval (0,1). \n\nWait, but do I need to check if there are any implicit assumptions here? For example, arcsin(x) is defined for x in [-1,1], and since the integral is from 0 to 1, that's fine. The denominator sqrt(1 - x^2) is also defined and non-zero except at x=1, but the integral is up to 1, so there might be an improper integral consideration there. Similarly, ln x is defined for x > 0, so on (0,1) it's okay. The denominator x^3 + x factors as x(x^2 +1), which is non-zero except at x=0. So the integrand has singularities at 0 and 1, but the integral is still convergent? The user mentions numerical approximation, implying that the integral exists, so maybe that's an assumption. But the problem is to prove the closed-form, so perhaps the assumptions are about the convergence of the integral.\n\nBut the example given in the problem had assumptions about the variable (n being integer, divisible by 7). Here, in the integral problem, the variable x is integrated over [0,1], which is given. So maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond the integral setup. Wait, the user didn't specify any particular conditions except the integral itself. Therefore, the assumptions might just be the integral is from 0 to 1, and the integrand is as given.\n\nWait, but according to the example, assumptions are listed as conditions applied to the objects in the problem. In the example, the variable n was assumed to be an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the integral is definite from 0 to 1, which is part of the problem statement. Therefore, maybe there are no additional assumptions besides the integral's limits and the integrand's form. So, perhaps the assumption here is that the integral converges? Or maybe there are no explicit assumptions needed here because the problem is to evaluate the integral as given. The example given had specific conditions on n, but in this case, perhaps there are no such conditions. So maybe the assumption section is empty? But the format requires listing assumptions. The example showed that even if the original problem didn't state assumptions, the formatted version might extract them. Wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem in the example was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n. However, the formatted problem's assumption included that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect unless the user made a mistake. Wait, let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions are: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so why does the formatted problem have n divisible by 7? That seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect. If the original problem states \"for every integer n\", then the assumption is n is an integer. But the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That would be incorrect unless the problem was actually for n divisible by 7. Perhaps the example was a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a typo, and the correct assumption is that n is divisible by 7. But regardless, the user provided that example as their structure, so when applying it to the current problem, perhaps they expect me to list the necessary assumptions even if they're part of the problem statement.\n\nIn the current integral problem, the problem is to compute the integral from 0 to 1. The integrand has several components: (x^2 +1)arcsin(x)/sqrt(1 -x^2) + 2x ln(x^2 +1), all multiplied by ln x / (x^3 +x). So, perhaps the assumptions would be that the integral is convergent, but since the problem is posed as evaluating it, that's part of the problem. Alternatively, maybe the assumption is that x is in (0,1), but that's already part of the integral's limits. So perhaps there are no explicit assumptions beyond the integral's setup.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the reader is aware that Catalan's constant is involved, but that's part of the problem statement. Hmm. The example's assumptions were about the variable in the problem. Here, the variable is integrated over, so maybe there are no assumptions. But the format requires me to list assumptions. If there are no explicit assumptions, perhaps I should state that there are none. But the example had two assumptions even when the original problem didn't state them. Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which was translated into the assumption \"n is an integer\". Then where did \"n is divisible by 7\" come from? That seems like a mistake. Unless the user intended to modify the problem. Wait, let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal problem in example: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem statement: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but 91 is 7*13. So if the original problem says it's divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem adds that n must be divisible by 7, that's a contradiction. So perhaps the example is wrong, or maybe the user intended to have a different original problem. For instance, if the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 when n is divisible by 7, then the assumptions would make sense. So there might be a mistake in the example. But regardless, the user provided that as their example, so I need to follow their format.\n\nIn their example, even though the original problem states \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem lists two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. So maybe the user expects that any conditions on variables in the problem are to be listed as assumptions, even if they are part of the problem's universal quantifier. But in the example, \"for every integer n\" would mean that n is an integer is the domain, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91 for all such n. But the formatted problem includes n is divisible by 7 as an assumption, which is a stricter condition. So that seems inconsistent. Perhaps the example is incorrect. But I need to proceed as per the user's instruction.\n\nIn the current problem, the integral is from 0 to 1, and the integrand is as given. The problem is to prove that the integral equals -2G ln2. So perhaps the assumptions here are the limits of integration and the integrand's expression. However, the example's assumptions were about the variable (n) in the problem, not about the integral's setup. Therefore, maybe in this integral problem, there are no variables with conditions, so the assumptions section is empty. But the format requires me to list assumptions. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the integral converges, which is necessary for the closed-form to exist. So maybe the assumption is that the integral converges. But the user's example didn't include such an assumption. Alternatively, since the problem is to evaluate the integral, the convergence is part of the problem, not an assumption. Therefore, perhaps there are no assumptions here. But the example had assumptions even when they were part of the problem's statement. So maybe the user wants to list all conditions on variables, even if they are part of the problem's given. In the integral case, the variable x is integrated over [0,1], but that's part of the problem statement. So perhaps the assumption is that x is in [0,1]. But that's redundant. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no assumptions needed here. The example might have had a mistake, but following the structure, I need to list assumptions. Maybe in this case, since there are no variables with conditions beyond what's given in the problem, the assumption section is empty. But the example didn't have an empty assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the assumption is that G is Catalan's constant. But that's part of the problem statement. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking back at the example, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", which becomes an assumption. So any universal quantifier on variables becomes an assumption. In the integral problem, the variable x is integrated over [0,1], but x is a dummy variable. The problem is to compute the integral, so perhaps there are no assumptions here. Therefore, maybe the assumption section is empty. But the example's format requires at least one assumption. However, the user's example included two assumptions even when the problem was stated as \"for every integer n\", which suggests that they consider the universal quantifier as an assumption. So perhaps in this integral problem, the only assumption is that the integral is taken over x from 0 to 1. But that's part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is posed correctly, and the assumptions are already included in the problem's setup. Therefore, maybe there are no additional assumptions. However, the example shows that assumptions can be part of the problem's original statement. In the integral problem, the integral is defined from 0 to 1, so maybe the assumption is that x ranges from 0 to 1. But since that's part of the integral's notation, it's redundant. Maybe the user expects that the problem is restructured with the integral limits as assumptions. But in the example, the variable n was listed as an assumption even though it was part of the problem's universal quantifier. Therefore, following that, perhaps here the assumption is that the integral is from 0 to 1, and x is the variable of integration. But that seems redundant. Alternatively, since the problem is to evaluate the integral, the integrand's form and the limits are part of the problem statement. The example's problem statement included the expression for A(n), so maybe in this case, the problem statement includes the integral expression, and the assumptions are about any conditions needed for the integrand to be defined or convergent. For example, the integrand has terms like arcsin(x) and sqrt(1 - x^2), which are defined for x in [0,1), and at x=1, sqrt(1 -x^2) becomes zero, but the integrand might have a limit there. Similarly, near x=0, ln x tends to -infinity, but multiplied by x in the denominator, etc. So the integral is improper at both 0 and 1. Therefore, an assumption could be that the integral converges. But the problem states that numerically it's approximately a certain value, implying convergence, so maybe that's part of the problem. However, the example didn't include convergence as an assumption. Hmm. This is a bit confusing. \n\nGiven the user's example, they converted the original problem's universal quantifier into an assumption. So \"for every integer n\" became \"n is an integer\". Then added another assumption \"n is divisible by 7\", which might have been a mistake unless the original problem had that condition. But regardless, in the current problem, there's no variable with conditions other than the integral's limits. So perhaps the assumptions section is empty. However, the format requires listing assumptions. To resolve this, maybe the assumption here is that the integral converges, but since the problem is to evaluate it, that's part of what needs to be proven. Alternatively, maybe there are no assumptions, and the user's example was an exception. Since the user's example included assumptions even if they were part of the problem's statement, perhaps here the assumption is that x is in (0,1). But since the integral is from 0 to 1, that's already covered. Alternatively, the problem might have an implicit assumption that the integrand is integrable over [0,1], but that's again part of the problem's nature. \n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to follow the example structure. In the example, the problem was restructured to include the variable's conditions as assumptions. Here, since there's no variable with conditions outside the integral's setup, maybe there are no assumptions. But the example required assumptions. Alternatively, the integrand's components might require assumptions. For example, arcsin(x) is defined for x in [-1,1], which is true here, but since x is from 0 to 1, that's already part of the integral's limits. Similarly, the denominator x^3 +x is x(x^2 +1), which is non-zero except at x=0, so near x=0, the integrand behaves like (terms with arcsin(0) which is 0, and ln x / x, which is ln x /x. Wait, near x=0, let's see: the first part of the integrand is [(x^2 +1)arcsin(x)/sqrt(1 -x^2) + 2x ln(x^2 +1)] * [ln x / (x^3 +x)]. Let's break it down:\n\nAs x approaches 0:\n\narcsin(x) ~ x + x^3/6 + ..., sqrt(1 -x^2) ~ 1 -x^2/2, so (x^2 +1) ~1, so the first term becomes approximately (1)(x)/1 =x. Then multiplied by ln x / (x^3 +x) = ln x /x(x^2 +1) ~ ln x /x. So the first term's contribution near 0 is x * (ln x /x) = ln x, which tends to -infinity. But the integral of ln x near 0 is convergent (since ∫ ln x dx from 0 to a is x ln x - x evaluated from 0 to a, which converges). Similarly, the second term in the integrand: 2x ln(x^2 +1) ~2x*(x^2) ~2x^3, multiplied by ln x /x ~2x^2 ln x, which tends to 0 as x approaches 0. Therefore, the dominant term near 0 is ln x, which is integrable. Near x=1: arcsin(x) approaches π/2, sqrt(1 -x^2) approaches 0. So the first term becomes (1 +1)(π/2)/sqrt(1 -x^2) = π/sqrt(1 -x^2). Then multiplied by ln x / (x^3 +x). As x approaches 1, ln x ~ (x -1) - (x -1)^2/2 + ..., so ln x ~ x -1. The denominator x^3 +x ~1 +1=2. So the first term near 1 is π/sqrt(1 -x^2) * (x -1)/2. Let t =1 -x, as t approaches 0: sqrt(1 -x^2) = sqrt(2t - t^2) ~ sqrt(2t). So the term becomes π / sqrt(2t) * (-t)/2 ~ -π/(2 sqrt(2)) * sqrt(t), which tends to 0. Therefore, the integrand near 1 behaves like sqrt(t) which is integrable. Therefore, the integral converges. So maybe the assumption is that the integral converges. But the problem is to evaluate it, so perhaps that's part of the proof. \n\nGiven that, and following the example where the problem's universal quantifier was turned into an assumption, but here there's no variable with conditions, perhaps the assumption section is empty. However, the format requires listing assumptions. Maybe the user expects that if there are no explicit assumptions, we just list the problem. But in the example, they listed two assumptions. Alternatively, maybe the problem is self-contained, so the assumptions are already in the problem statement. Therefore, in this case, perhaps there are no additional assumptions beyond what's in the problem statement, so the assumption section is empty. However, the example had two assumptions even when the problem statement included them. To resolve this, perhaps the correct approach is to list the integral's limits and the integrand's components as assumptions. But that's part of the problem statement. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem doesn't require any assumptions beyond the integral being defined as given. Therefore, the assumption section could be empty, but the format might require at least one assumption. Since the example had two, maybe here we can list that x is a real variable, or that the integral is taken over [0,1]. But according to the example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is taken over the interval [0, 1],\nThe integrand is defined as \\(\\frac{(x^2 + 1)\\arcsin(x)}{\\sqrt{1 - x^2}} + 2x \\ln(x^2 + 1)\\) multiplied by \\(\\frac{\\ln x}{x^3 + x}\\),\n\\(G\\) denotes Catalan's constant.\n\nBut in the example, assumptions were about the variable n. Here, the problem is about the integral's setup and the components of the integrand. However, according to the user's instruction, assumptions should address only one property or condition applied to one object. The problem statement already includes the integral from 0 to 1 and the integrand, so perhaps those are part of the problem statement, not assumptions. The example's problem statement included the expression for A(n), so similarly, the current problem's statement should include the integral expression, and the assumptions would be any underlying conditions needed. Since the integral is from 0 to 1, that's part of the problem. The integrand's definition is part of the problem. The only thing that could be an assumption is that G is Catalan's constant. But that's part of the problem's conclusion. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are no assumptions, and the user's example had a mistake. In that case, the formatted problem would have an empty assumption section. However, the example's format requires assumptions, so maybe the user expects that even if there are none, we list something. But that doesn't make sense. Given the confusion, perhaps the safest way is to follow the example structure as closely as possible, even if there's a mistake. In the example, the assumptions were about the variable in the problem. Here, there's no variable with conditions, so perhaps the assumptions are about the integral's existence or convergence. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral \\(\\int\\limits_0^1\\left(\\frac{\\left(x^2+1\\right)\\arcsin(x)}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}+2x\\ln\\left(x^2+1\\right)\\right)\\frac{\\ln x}{x^3+x}\\,dx\\) converges.\n\nBut the problem statement includes the integral, so the assumption is part of the problem. Alternatively, maybe the assumption is that x is in (0,1). But that's part of the integral's limits. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has no assumptions beyond what's stated, and the example's inclusion of \"n is divisible by 7\" was a mistake. Given that, and since the user's instruction says \"filtered the unrelated informations\", perhaps the original question's title and some parts are noise. The original title is a long integral expression, which is restated in the question. The problem is to prove the integral equals -2G ln2. The assumptions needed would be about the components of the integrand being defined and integrable, but since the problem is posed as conjecturing the closed-form, perhaps the convergence is assumed. Therefore, the assumption could be that the integral converges, but since the problem is to evaluate it, that's part of the proof. Alternatively, the problem has no explicit assumptions, so the assumption section is empty. However, the format requires the assumption section. Given the example, even if it's incorrect, I need to follow it. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach here is to list the integral's existence (convergence) as an assumption. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral converges.\n\nProblem:\nProve that \n\\[\nI = \\int\\limits_0^1\\left(\\frac{\\left(x^2+1\\right)\\arcsin(x)}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}+2x\\ln\\left(x^2+1\\right)\\right)\\frac{\\ln x}{x^3+x}\\,dx = -2\\,G\\,\\ln2,\n\\]\nwhere \\(G\\) is Catalan's constant.\n\nBut in the example, assumptions were about the variable's properties. Here, since there's no variable with conditions, maybe the only assumption is the integral's convergence. Alternatively, since the problem is to prove the equality, the convergence is part of the proof. Therefore, perhaps there are no assumptions, and the user's example was an exception. In that case, the formatted problem would have an empty assumption section. But the user's example didn't have an empty assumption section. This is confusing.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I think the best approach is to follow the user's example structure. In the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, and the formatted problem listed n as an integer and divisible by 7. That might have been an error, but assuming the user wants similar treatment, in this integral problem, perhaps list the integral's limits and components as assumptions. However, the example's assumptions were about the variable's properties. Since there's no variable here other than the dummy variable x, which is integrated over, perhaps there are no assumptions. Therefore, the assumptions section is empty. But the format requires it. Alternatively, since the problem is to prove the equality, and the integral is given, perhaps the assumption is that the closed-form expression is conjectured to be -2G ln2. But that's part of the problem statement. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions are that the integrand is composed of elementary functions and G is Catalan's constant. But that's redundant. Given the confusion and time constraints, I'll proceed to list the integral's convergence as an assumption, even though it's part of the problem's proof. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral converges.\n\nProblem:\nProve that \n\\[\nI = \\int\\limits_0^1\\left(\\frac{\\left(x^2+1\\right)\\arcsin(x)}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}+2x\\ln\\left(x^2+1\\right)\\right)\\frac{\\ln x}{x^3+x}\\,dx = -2\\,G\\,\\ln2,\n\\]\nwhere \\(G\\) is Catalan's constant.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is correct. Alternatively, perhaps there are no assumptions, and the user's example had a mistake. In that case, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nProblem:\nProve that \n\\[\nI = \\int\\limits_0^1\\left(\\frac{\\left(x^2+1\\right)\\arcsin(x)}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}+2x\\ln\\left(x^2+1\\right)\\right)\\frac{\\ln x}{x^3+x}\\,dx = -2\\,G\\,\\ln2,\n\\]\nwhere \\(G\\) is Catalan's constant.\n\nBut according to the example, assumptions must be listed. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is to list the integral's existence as an assumption. However, since the integral's convergence is part of what needs to be shown when evaluating it, perhaps that's not an assumption. In conclusion, given the ambiguity and following the example's structure where assumptions were listed even if part of the problem's statement, here's the formatted problem:",
