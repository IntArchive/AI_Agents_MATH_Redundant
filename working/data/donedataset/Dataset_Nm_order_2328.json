    "Content": "MathWorld states: \"In general, an $n^\\text{th}$-order ODE has $n$ linearly independent solutions\". Are they referring to linear ODEs? I only know why it should be true for ODEs with constant coefficients, by the following observations: The solutions to the differential equation $a_0f+\\dots +a_nf^{(n)}=0$, where $a_n\\ne 0$ form a vector space $V$ (check). Let $f\\in C^n(\\mathbb{R})$ s.t. $a_0f+\\dots +a_nf^{(n)}=0$, where $a_n\\ne 0$. Let $\\vec{a}=(a_0,a_1,\\dots,a_{n-1})$ and $\\vec{f}=(f,f^{(1)},\\dots,f^{(n-1)})$. $f^{(n)}=-a_n^{-1}(a_0f+\\dots +a_{n-1}f^{(n-1)})=-a_n^{-1}\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{f}$ is differentiable, and the $m^\\text{th}$ derivative of $\\vec{b}\\cdot\\vec{f}$ is: $$\\vec b\\left(\\matrix{\\vec{e_2}\\\\\\vdots\\\\\\vec{e_n}\\\\-a_n^{-1}\\vec{a}}\\right)^m\\cdot \\vec{f}$$ Hence $f$ is infinitely differentiable. Moreover, the coefficients above are bounded above by an exponential in $m$. For any closed interval $[-d,d]$, $\\vec{f}$ is continuous and therefore bounded. This means that the Taylor series for $f$ converges to $f$ in the interval by Taylor's theorem for the expansion about $x=0$ (using the Lagrange form of the remainder on the whole interval). Hence the Taylor series for $f$ about $x=0$ converges to $f$ for all $\\mathbb{R}$, i.e. $f$ is analytic. Now consider the linear transformation $L:V\\to\\mathbb{R}^n,f\\mapsto (f(0),f^{(1)}(0),\\dots,f^{(n-1)}(0))$. To prove surjectivity, use the differential equation to produce a Taylor series and show that it is a solution. Injectivity is proven by the below: If $L(f)=L(g)$ for some solutions $f,g$, then $\\forall k=0,1,\\dots,n-1, f^{(k)}(0)=g^{(k)}(0)$, and by the differential equation, this also holds for all $k\\in\\mathbb{N}$. $f$ and $g$ are analytic and since the Taylor series is unique, $f=g$. Hence, $V$ has dimension $n$. Is my proof correct? Is the theorem for general linear ODEs true, and how do I prove it?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Your proof is now good.  For the homogeneous non-constant coefficient system $$a_n(t)x^{(n)}+\\cdots +a_0(t)x=0$$ the solutions again form a vector space, there is nothing different in this respect. How to find its dimension (in particular, prove that the dimension is not zero)? One cannonball way to proceed is to rewrite it as a first order vector valued equation by introducing variables $x_1=x',\\cdots$.  This furnishes the first order equation $$X'(t)=A(t)X(t).$$  Here the function $A$ is assumed nicely behaved from some interval $(a,b)$ to the Banach space $\\mathbb{R}^n$, e.g. take the entries to be Lipschitz and $a_n(t)\\neq 0$ on $(a,b)$ to avoid the degenerate locus (in fact, assume $a_i/a_n(t)$ are also Lipschitz on the interval).  Then we can form any IVP we want $$X'=A(t)X(t),\\quad X(0)=X_0$$ and the Picard-Lindelof theorem furnishes a unique solution with the initial condition $X_0$ (if one tries to simplify the proof of P-L for linear systems one still ends up having to perform the crucial approximation process and prove the uniform convergence, which is the big deal in P-L itself). But now the fact that you can find solutions corresponding to $n$ linearly independent choices of $X_0$ implies that the vector space of solutions is exactly $n$-dimensional by the theorem on the Wronskian (the Wronskian of $n$ solutions is either identically zero or never zero; if the initial vectors $X_0$ are linearly independent, the Wronskian is nonzero somewhere , so it is never zero on $(a,b)$ and thus the solutions are independent).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this Math Stack Exchange question. The user is asking about whether the statement that an nth-order ODE has n linearly independent solutions refers specifically to linear ODEs, and they also want to know if their proof is correct and how to extend it to general linear ODEs.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original problem. The user starts by quoting MathWorld saying that an nth-order ODE has n linearly independent solutions. They question if this is only for linear ODEs, as they only know the proof for constant coefficient cases. Then they present their own proof, which they think shows that the solution space is n-dimensional for linear ODEs with constant coefficients. They also ask if the theorem holds for general linear ODEs and how to prove it.\n\nThe task is to structure this into the given format: listing assumptions and the problem statement. Let me recall the example provided. The original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7, then the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nSo, here, I need to extract all the assumptions from the user's question. The user mentions linear ODEs, specifically. The problem is about whether the nth-order ODE having n solutions refers to linear ones, and whether their proof is correct. But the user's own proof is for constant coefficient linear ODEs. So, the assumptions here would include that the ODE is linear, has constant coefficients, etc.\n\nWait, but the user's question is whether the general theorem (for linear ODEs, not necessarily constant coefficients) is true, and how to prove it. Their own proof is for constant coefficients, using the fact that solutions are analytic and constructing an isomorphism via initial conditions.\n\nSo, in the problem statement, the user is asking two things: 1) Is their proof correct for the constant coefficient case? 2) Is the theorem true for general linear ODEs, and how to prove it?\n\nBut the original question's title is about the nth-order ODE having n solutions, and the user is clarifying if that's only for linear ODEs. So, perhaps the main problem here is: \"Is it true that an nth-order linear ODE has n linearly independent solutions? If so, how can this be proven?\" The user's own approach is for constant coefficients, but they are unsure about the general case.\n\nNow, to structure this into the Assumption and Problem sections. The assumptions would be the conditions under which the problem is posed. The user's problem involves linear ODEs, possibly with variable coefficients, but their own proof is for constant coefficients. The problem they are asking about is whether the general statement holds for linear ODEs (not necessarily constant coefficients) and how to prove it.\n\nBut looking at the user's original question: They start by quoting MathWorld's statement and asking if it refers to linear ODEs. Then they present their proof for the constant coefficient case and ask if their proof is correct and if the theorem holds for general linear ODEs.\n\nSo the assumptions here would be the properties of the ODE in question. The user's problem is about linear ODEs. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The ODE is linear.\n- The ODE is of nth-order.\n- The coefficients of the ODE are constants. (But wait, in the user's own proof, they use constant coefficients, but the general question is about linear ODEs, which could have variable coefficients. So perhaps the assumptions need to distinguish between constant coefficients and variable coefficients?)\n\nWait, the user is asking two things: first, whether their proof for the constant coefficient case is correct, and second, whether the theorem (about n solutions) is true for general linear ODEs (with variable coefficients). So the problem has two parts. But the way to structure it into Assumption and Problem might need to separate these.\n\nBut the example given had the problem structured such that assumptions are all the conditions, and the problem is the actual question. However, in the user's case, the problem is split into two: one under constant coefficients and another under general linear ODEs.\n\nBut perhaps to structure this, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The differential equation is linear.\n- The differential equation is nth-order.\n- The coefficients of the differential equation are constants. (For the user's own proof)\n- The leading coefficient is non-zero. (Since they mention a_n ≠ 0)\n- Solutions are considered over the real numbers. (Since the user uses C^n(R))\n\nBut the user's main problem is whether the general theorem (for linear ODEs) holds, beyond the constant coefficient case. So, perhaps the assumptions for the general problem would be:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The differential equation is linear.\n- The differential equation is nth-order.\n- The coefficients of the differential equation are continuous functions (for existence and uniqueness).\n- The leading coefficient is non-zero on the interval of consideration.\n\nProblem: Prove that the solution space of the ODE is n-dimensional, i.e., there are n linearly independent solutions.\n\nBut the user's own proof is in the constant coefficient case, and they are asking if their approach is correct and how to extend it. However, the format requires listing assumptions and then the problem. The user's problem is twofold: verification of their proof in the constant coefficient case, and the general case.\n\nBut the example given in the prompt had the original problem being restructured into Assumption and Problem. In that example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer, but the user mistakenly included an extra assumption (n divisible by 7), but the correct problem didn't require that. Wait, no—the example seems to have the formatted problem include the correct assumptions. Wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption is \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, original problem says \"for every integer n\", so in the formatted problem, why is there \"n is divisible by 7\"? That must be a mistake. Wait, no—the user provided an example where they might have incorrectly included an assumption. Wait, the example shows:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut that seems wrong. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption shouldn't include that n is divisible by 7. Maybe the example was a wrong example? But the user says \"You will be given some example which I structured before.\" So perhaps the example is illustrative, but maybe not correct. But regardless, the task is to structure the current problem into Assumption and Problem.\n\nBack to the current problem. The user's question is whether MathWorld's statement refers to linear ODEs, and they present their proof for the constant coefficient case. Then they ask if their proof is correct and if the general theorem holds for linear ODEs.\n\nSo the assumptions for their own proof would be:\n\n- The ODE is linear with constant coefficients.\n- The leading coefficient a_n ≠ 0.\n- Solutions are considered in C^n(R).\n- The transformation L: V → R^n maps f to its initial conditions at 0.\n\nBut the problem they are posing is:\n\n1. Is their proof correct for the constant coefficient case?\n2. Is the theorem true for general linear ODEs, and how to prove it?\n\nBut the required format is to have Assumption and Problem. The Problem should encapsulate the main question. Given that, perhaps the problem is: \"Prove that an nth-order linear ODE has n linearly independent solutions.\" The assumptions would then be the conditions required for that theorem.\n\nIn the case of linear ODEs with constant coefficients, the standard result is that the solution space is n-dimensional. For linear ODEs with variable coefficients, the existence and uniqueness theorem (under certain conditions like continuity of coefficients) ensures that the solution space is n-dimensional.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions for the general theorem would be:\n\n- The differential equation is linear.\n- The differential equation is of order n.\n- The coefficients of the differential equation are continuous functions on an interval I.\n- The leading coefficient is non-zero on I.\n\nProblem: Prove that the solution space is n-dimensional, i.e., there exist n linearly independent solutions.\n\nBut the user's own proof is in the constant coefficient case, using analyticity and the Taylor series. They also ask if their approach is correct.\n\nSo perhaps the formatted problem should have two parts? But the example given in the prompt didn't have multiple problems. It had a single problem.\n\nAlternatively, the user's problem is two-fold: validity of their proof for constant coefficients, and the general case. However, the format requires a single problem statement. So maybe the problem is as stated by the user: \"Is the theorem for general linear ODEs true, and how do I prove it?\" with the assumptions being that it's a linear ODE of order n with continuous coefficients and non-vanishing leading coefficient.\n\nBut the user also asks about their specific proof in the constant coefficient case. So perhaps the assumptions need to include both cases? But the example structured only the problem's inherent assumptions, not the user's specific approach.\n\nGiven the example, the assistant should extract the problem's inherent assumptions. The user is asking about the general theorem for linear ODEs (not necessarily constant coefficients). So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The differential equation is linear.\n- The differential equation is of order n.\n- The coefficients of the differential equation are continuous on an interval.\n- The leading coefficient is non-zero on the interval.\n\nProblem: Prove that the solution space is n-dimensional, i.e., there exist n linearly independent solutions.\n\nAdditionally, the user's own proof in the constant coefficient case might have other assumptions, but the main problem they are posing is about the general case.\n\nBut the user also asks if their proof is correct. However, the format requires the problem to be structured, not to answer the question. The task is to structure the problem as per the format, not to answer whether the proof is correct. So perhaps the problem here is the user's question, which is twofold:\n\n1. Is my proof correct for the constant coefficient case?\n2. Is the theorem true for general linear ODEs, and how to prove it?\n\nBut according to the example, the formatted problem should capture the main problem. The original problem's title is \"An nth-order ODE has n linearly independent solutions\", and the user is clarifying if this is for linear ODEs and asking about their proof.\n\nBut in the example, the formatted problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, with assumptions on n. Here, the formatted problem would need to capture the user's main question, which is whether the theorem holds for general linear ODEs (beyond constant coefficients) and if their proof for the constant coefficient case is valid.\n\nBut how to fit this into the format. The problem statement should be the question the user is posing. So perhaps:\n\nProblem: Is the statement that an nth-order ODE has n linearly independent solutions referring to linear ODEs? Is my proof correct for the constant coefficient case, and how can the theorem be proven for general linear ODEs?\n\nBut the example had a problem statement that was a direct mathematical statement to prove. The user's question here is more of a verification and extension of a theorem. However, given the example, maybe the problem should be phrased as a mathematical statement to prove, along with the verification of the existing proof.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is: \"Prove that an nth-order linear ODE has n linearly independent solutions.\" With assumptions on the ODE being linear, having continuous coefficients, etc.\n\nBut the user's own problem includes asking about their specific proof, but according to the instructions, the task is to structure the problem as per the format, which focuses on assumptions and problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the key here is to extract the core mathematical problem from the user's question, which is about the dimensionality of the solution space for linear ODEs. The user's specific proof and its correctness is part of their attempt, but the structured problem should be the general question they are asking.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would have assumptions about the ODE being linear, of order n, with continuous coefficients and non-vanishing leading coefficient, and the problem is to prove that the solution space is n-dimensional.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\n- The differential equation is linear.\n- The differential equation is of order n.\n- The coefficients of the differential equation are continuous functions on an interval $I$.\n- The leading coefficient is non-zero on $I$.\n\nProblem: Prove that the solution space of the differential equation is n-dimensional, i.e., there exist n linearly independent solutions.\n\nAdditionally, the user's original question also references their own proof for the constant coefficient case. But according to the example, the formatted problem should only include the problem's inherent assumptions and the problem statement. The user's specific proof and its correctness are part of their attempt, but the structured problem is the underlying mathematical question.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure is:\n\nAssumption:\n- The differential equation is linear.\n- The differential equation is of order n.\n- The coefficients of the differential equation are continuous on an interval.\n- The leading coefficient is non-zero on the interval.\n\nProblem: Prove that the solution space of the differential equation is n-dimensional.\n\nBut the user also mentions their own approach for constant coefficients. However, the task is to structure the problem, not the user's attempt. Therefore, the assumptions should cover the general case, and the problem is to prove the dimensionality.\n\nHowever, the user's question title is ambiguous about whether the ODE is linear. MathWorld's statement might not specify, but the user is clarifying if it's for linear ODEs. So the key assumption is that the ODE is linear. Hence:\n\nAssumption:\n- The differential equation is linear.\n- The differential equation is of order n.\n- The coefficients and the forcing function are continuous on an interval.\n- The leading coefficient is non-zero on the interval.\n\nProblem: Prove that there exist n linearly independent solutions to the differential equation.\n\nAlternatively, since for linear homogeneous ODEs, the solution space is a vector space of dimension n. So the problem is to prove that for an nth-order linear homogeneous ODE with continuous coefficients and non-vanishing leading coefficient, the solution space is n-dimensional.\n\nHence, the formatted answer should reflect that.\n\nTherefore, the final answer structured as per the format would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nThe differential equation is linear,\nThe differential equation is of order $n$,\nThe coefficients of the differential equation are continuous functions on an interval $I$,\nThe leading coefficient is non-zero on interval $I$.\nProblem:\nProve that there exist $n$ linearly independent solutions to the differential equation.\n###END_OF_FORMAT###",
