    "AcceptedAnswer": "The proof below assumes that $X$ and $Y$ belong to the sample space. That is, they map from the sample space to a real number line. Is that also a condition for linearity of expectation? No.   It's the definition of a random variable. Basically any random variable $X$ is a function that maps the sample space to the reals (or a subset there of, called the support). $$X: \\Omega \\mapsto \\Bbb R$$ If $X$ and $Y$ are both random variables of the same sample space, then so is their sum. $X+Y$ .   (That is not defined if they are not of the same sample space.) $$ X:\\Omega\\mapsto\\Bbb R~\\wedge~ Y:\\Omega\\mapsto \\Bbb R ~~\\implies~~ X+Y:\\Omega\\mapsto\\Bbb R\\\\\\forall s\\in\\Omega,\\quad(X+Y)(s) := X(s)+Y(s)$$ Linearity of Expectation then follows from its definition. $\\begin{align}\n\\mathsf E(X+Y) =&~ \\sum_{\\omega\\in\\Omega} (X+Y)(\\omega)~\\mathsf P(\\omega)\n\\\\[1ex] =&~ \\sum_{\\omega\\in \\Omega} X(\\omega)~\\mathsf P(\\omega)+\\sum_{\\omega\\in \\Omega} Y(\\omega)~\\mathsf P(\\omega)\n\\\\[1ex] =&~ \\mathsf E(X)+\\mathsf E(Y)\n\\end{align}$ Of course, this is for discrete random variables.   For continuous random variables we use integration , but everything is analogous by no coincidence. $\\begin{align}\n\\mathsf E(X+Y) =&~ \\int_{\\Omega} (X+Y)(\\omega)~\\mathsf P(\\mathrm d \\omega)\n\\\\[1ex] =&~ \\int_{\\Omega} X(\\omega)~\\mathsf P(\\mathrm d \\omega)+\\int_{\\Omega} Y(\\omega)~\\mathsf P(\\mathrm d \\omega)\n\\\\[1ex] =&~ \\mathsf E(X)+\\mathsf E(Y)\n\\end{align}$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user is asking about the proof of linearity of expectation when random variables are dependent. They mentioned that the proof for independent variables is intuitive, but they're unsure how it works when variables are dependent. Also, they're questioning if the condition that X and Y map from the sample space to the real numbers is necessary for linearity.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the linearity of expectation. The property states that the expected value of the sum of random variables is equal to the sum of their expected values, regardless of whether they are independent or dependent. So the user is correct in pointing out that independence isn't a requirement here. \n\nLooking at their proof steps, they start with the definition of expectation for the sum X+Y. They expand it into the sum over the sample space of (X(s) + Y(s)) * P(s). Then they split the sum into two separate sums, which gives E(X) + E(Y). The user is confused about step 2, where they split the sum. Maybe they're not sure if splitting the sum is valid when variables are dependent. \n\nWait, splitting the sum into two separate sums is a basic property of summations in mathematics. The linearity of summation allows you to separate the terms regardless of dependence. Dependence affects things like joint distributions or variance, but expectation is linear by nature. So even if X and Y are dependent, the expectation of their sum is still the sum of their expectations. \n\nThe user also asks if the condition that X and Y map from the sample space to the real numbers is necessary. Well, the definition of random variables requires them to be measurable functions from the sample space to the real numbers. So that's a standard assumption in probability theory, but the linearity holds as long as the expectations exist (i.e., they are finite). So maybe the key assumptions here are that X and Y are random variables defined on the same probability space, and their expectations exist. \n\nIn the example provided, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the problem's specific conditions. Translating that to the current problem, the assumptions should be the necessary conditions for the linearity of expectation. Since linearity doesn't require independence, the main assumptions would be about X and Y being random variables with defined expectations. \n\nSo, the assumptions for the problem would include that X and Y are random variables defined on the same probability space (sample space S), and that their expected values exist (are finite). The problem is to prove that E(X+Y) = E(X) + E(Y) under these conditions. \n\nThe user also references a lecture and mentions they don't understand step 2 completely. Step 2 in their proof is splitting the summation. This is allowed due to the linearity of summation, which doesn't depend on the independence of the variables. The summation of a sum is the sum of the summations, regardless of the relationship between X and Y. \n\nSo putting it all together, the assumptions for the problem are that X and Y are random variables on the same sample space, each with defined expectations. The problem is to prove the linearity of expectation formula under these conditions. The confusion about dependence is addressed by noting that dependence doesn't affect the linearity property of expectation, which is a fundamental property derived directly from the linearity of integrals (or sums, in discrete cases).",
