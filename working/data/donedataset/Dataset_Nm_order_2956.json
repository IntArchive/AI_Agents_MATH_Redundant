    "Content": "I had a professor who once introduced us to Wallpaper Groups. There are many references that exist to understand what they are (example Wiki, Wallpaper group ). The punchline is $$There \\,\\, are \\,\\, exactly \\,\\, 17 \\,\\, wallpaper \\,\\, groups \\,\\,(17 \\,\\, ways \\,\\, to \\,\\, tile \\,\\, the \\,\\, plane)$$ My question is $2$ -fold: Can someone sketch out the proof or at least give some high level ideas of why this may be true? Can someone refer me to a website or a textbook that develops the proof in detail?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Sketch of the proof: Let $\\Gamma \\le {\\rm Iso}(\\Bbb R^2)$ be a wallpaper group. Then $\\Gamma$ has a normal subgroup isomorphic\nto $\\Bbb Z^2$ with finite quotient $F$ . This finite group acts on the lattice $\\Bbb Z^2$ by conjugation. \nWe obtain a faithful representation $$\nF \\hookrightarrow {\\rm Aut}(\\Bbb Z^2)\\cong GL_2(\\Bbb Z).\n$$ The group $GL_2(\\Bbb Z)$ has exactly $13$ different conjugacy classes of finite subgroups,\ncalled arithmetic ornament classes : \\begin{align*}\nC_1 & \\cong \\left\\langle \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right\\rangle,\\;\nC_2 \\cong \\left\\langle \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right\\rangle,\\;\nC_3 \\cong \\left\\langle \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right\\rangle, \\\\\nC_4 & \\cong \\left\\langle \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right\\rangle, \\;\nC_6 \\cong \\left\\langle \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right\\rangle, \\;\nD_1 \\cong \\left\\langle \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right\\rangle, \\\\\nD_1 & \\cong \\left\\langle \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right\\rangle, \\;\nD_2 \\cong  \\left\\langle \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix},\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\right\\rangle, \\\\\nD_2 & \\cong  \\left\\langle \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix},\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\right\\rangle, \\; D_3 \\cong \\left\\langle \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix},\n\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\right\\rangle, \\\\\nD_3 & \\cong  \\left\\langle \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix},\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\right\\rangle,\\\\\nD_4 & \\cong  \\left\\langle \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix},\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\right\\rangle, \\; D_6\\cong  \\left\\langle \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix},\n\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\right\\rangle.\n\\end{align*} This is an easy computation. Here $C_1,C_2,C_3,C_4,C_6$ are cyclic groups and $D_1,D_2,D_3,D_4,D_6$ are dihedral groups. We use here, that the order $n$ of a subgroup must satisfy $\\phi(n)=deg(\\Phi_n)\\mid 2$ , so that $n=1,2,3,4,6$ . This is called the crystallographic condition . The wallpaper groups arise from these $13$ classes by equivalence classes of extensions $$\n1\\rightarrow \\Bbb Z^2\\rightarrow \\Gamma\\rightarrow F\\rightarrow 1,\n$$ determined by $H^2(F,\\Bbb Z^2)$ . By computing $H^2(F,\\Bbb Z^2)$ in each case we obtain $18$ inequivalent extensions, because in $13$ cases the cohomology is trivial, and in three cases we get $C_2,C_2$ and $C_2\\times C_2$ , i.e., $5$ additional possibilities, so that $13+5=18$ .\nThis yields $17$ different groups, because two of them turn out to be isomorphic.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about proving there are exactly 17 wallpaper groups. \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The user mentioned that each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. Looking at the problem, the key points are:\n\n1. The groups are wallpaper groups, which are tilings of the plane.\n2. The classification is about symmetry groups in two-dimensional space.\n3. The symmetries considered are isometries (rigid motions) of the plane.\n4. The tiling is periodic, meaning it has translational symmetry in at least two directions.\n5. The groups are considered up to isomorphism, so different tilings that have the same symmetry type are counted as one group.\n6. The classification excludes color-preserving symmetries, focusing only on geometric symmetries.\n\nWait, but does the original question explicitly state all these assumptions? Let me check the original problem again. The user's question mentions \"Wallpaper Groups\" and refers to the fact that they tile the plane. The Wikipedia link probably explains the standard assumptions, but the problem statement itself is brief. \n\nHmm, the user's example included assumptions from the problem statement. The original problem here states: \"there are exactly 17 wallpaper groups (tilings of the plane)\". The key assumptions would be that the tiling is of the Euclidean plane, by wallpaper groups, which are symmetry groups containing translations in two independent directions. Also, that the classification is up to isomorphism, and that the groups are discrete (no arbitrarily small translations). Maybe also that the symmetries include orientation-preserving and reversing isometries.\n\nBut since the original problem statement is brief, I need to extract assumptions from what's given. The title mentions \"Tilings of the plane\", so assumptions might include:\n\n- The tiling is of the Euclidean plane.\n- The symmetry group is a wallpaper group (i.e., includes translations in two non-parallel directions).\n- The group is discrete (no arbitrarily small symmetries).\n- The classification is up to isomorphism.\n\nHowever, the user's example included assumptions that were more directly from the problem statement. In the original example, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7, even though the problem only stated \"for every integer n\". Wait, no, in the example, the formatted problem actually changed the original problem's assumption. Wait, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n...\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe there was a mistake in the example. Let me check.\n\nOriginal problem in example: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that seems like a mistake. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption shouldn't restrict n to be divisible by 7. Unless there's a misread. Maybe the original problem had a typo, and the user corrected it? Hmm, perhaps the example is incorrect. But regardless, the user wants me to follow the format where assumptions are listed line by line, each about one property applied to one object.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's question is about the proof that there are exactly 17 wallpaper groups. The problem statement mentions that they are tilings of the plane, and references the wallpaper groups. So assumptions would include:\n\n- The plane is two-dimensional Euclidean.\n- The tiling is periodic in two independent directions (translational symmetry).\n- The symmetry group is discrete (i.e., the translations have minimal lengths).\n- The classification considers groups up to isomorphism (conjugacy in the group of affine transformations).\n- The groups include all isometries (rotations, reflections, glide reflections, translations) that preserve the tiling.\n\nBut again, the problem statement doesn't specify all these, so maybe I should only list the assumptions explicitly mentioned or strongly implied by the problem. The original problem says \"there are exactly 17 wallpaper groups (tilings of the plane)\", so the main assumption is that we're talking about wallpaper groups, which by definition are the symmetry groups of such tilings. The key properties of wallpaper groups are that they are discrete, contain translations in two directions, and are classified up to isomorphism.\n\nBut since the user wants each assumption to address only one property or condition applied to one object, I need to break down the definition of wallpaper groups into separate assumptions.\n\nSo possible assumptions:\n\n- The symmetry group acts on the Euclidean plane.\n- The group contains translations in two linearly independent directions.\n- The group is discrete (no arbitrarily small translations).\n- The classification is up to isomorphism (conjugacy by affine transformations).\n- The symmetries include isometries (rotations, reflections, glide reflections).\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't mention all these explicitly. It just refers to wallpaper groups. So maybe the main assumption is that we're considering wallpaper groups, which inherently have those properties. However, the user's example included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (adding n divisible by 7), which seems incorrect. So perhaps in this case, the assumption is just \"The tiling is of the plane by wallpaper groups\".\n\nBut the example seems to have taken an original problem that said \"for every integer n\" and added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which conflicts. That might be a mistake in the example. Therefore, maybe the user wants to extract assumptions from the problem statement as given, without adding new ones. But the original example's formatted problem changed the original's \"for every integer n\" to assuming n is divisible by 7. That suggests that perhaps the user made an error in their example, or maybe the original problem had a typo. \n\nGiven that confusion, perhaps in this case, since the problem is about wallpaper groups, the key assumption is that we are considering discrete symmetry groups of the Euclidean plane with two independent translations. But since the problem statement just refers to \"wallpaper groups\", which by definition include those properties, maybe the assumptions should list the defining properties of wallpaper groups. However, the user wants each assumption to be one line, one property.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the context of the problem, the only assumption needed is that we're dealing with wallpaper groups, and the problem is to prove there are exactly 17. But the example had multiple assumptions. Wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Unless there was a misread. For example, if the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, which is 7*13, then perhaps the user intended to structure the problem assuming n is divisible by 7 and 13, but the original example didn't. Hmm, but 91 is 7*13, so maybe the problem requires n to satisfy certain congruence conditions. But the example's original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the formatted problem's assumption that n is divisible by 7 might be a mistake.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps I should proceed by taking the problem as stated and listing the necessary assumptions inherent to the problem's context. For the wallpaper groups, the standard assumptions are:\n\n- The group is a crystallographic group in two dimensions.\n- The group contains translations in two non-parallel directions.\n- The group is discrete.\n- The classification is up to isomorphism (conjugacy by affine transformations).\n\nSo each of these could be separate assumptions. But the problem statement doesn't explicitly mention all of them. Since the problem is about wallpaper groups, which by definition have these properties, maybe we need to list them as assumptions for clarity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the number of wallpaper groups, and the assumptions are inherent. But the user wants each assumption listed. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The symmetry group acts on the Euclidean plane.\n- The group includes translations in two linearly independent directions.\n- The group is discrete (no arbitrarily small translations).\n- The classification considers groups up to isomorphism (affine equivalence).\n\nProblem: Prove that there are exactly 17 such wallpaper groups.\n\nBut the original problem's title says \"Proof that there exist only 17 Wallpaper Groups (Tilings of the plane)\", and the question asks for a sketch of the proof or references. So the problem is to prove the number is 17, given the assumptions of what a wallpaper group is.\n\nTherefore, structuring it:\n\nAssumption:\nThe symmetry group is a wallpaper group (tiling of the plane with translations in two independent directions),\nThe group is discrete,\nThe classification is up to affine isomorphism.\n\nBut each assumption on one line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe group acts on the Euclidean plane,\nThe group contains translations in two linearly independent directions,\nThe group is discrete,\nThe classification is up to affine isomorphism.\n\nProblem: Prove that there are exactly 17 wallpaper groups.\n\nBut I need to check the example again. In the example, the original problem was about proving divisibility by 91, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which might not be in the original. This suggests that perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user wants to follow that structure. However, in the current problem, the user's question is about the number of wallpaper groups, which by definition already have certain properties. But maybe the assumptions should list the defining properties of wallpaper groups. Since the problem is to prove there are 17, the assumptions are the conditions that define wallpaper groups.\n\nSo breaking down the definition:\n\n1. The group consists of isometries of the Euclidean plane.\n2. The group is discrete (no arbitrarily small translations).\n3. The group contains translations in two linearly independent directions.\n4. Two groups are considered the same if they are conjugate under an affine transformation.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. Thus, the formatted problem would list these assumptions and then the problem is to prove there are exactly 17 such groups.\n\nBut the original problem statement doesn't explicitly list all these; it just refers to wallpaper groups. So perhaps the user wants to extract the key assumptions from the problem's context. However, since the user provided an example where assumptions were added beyond the original problem (n divisible by 7), maybe here we need to list the defining properties of wallpaper groups as assumptions, even if they're not explicitly stated in the problem.\n\nIn conclusion, the formatted problem should list the defining properties of wallpaper groups as assumptions, each on their own line, and then state the problem as proving there are exactly 17.",
