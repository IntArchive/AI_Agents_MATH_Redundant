    "Content": "I've tried to prove that $2^{n}+5$ will not divide $5^{n}-3^{n}$ using Jacobi symbol , but this is still not sufficient to prove that $\\gcd\\left(2^{n}+5,5^{n}-3^{n}\\right)=1$ . The proof of $2^{n}+5$ will not divide $5^{n}-3^{n}$ : Assuming that $2^{n}+5$ will divide $5^{n}-3^{n}$ : If n is even As $\\operatorname{ord}_3(2) = 2$ , so $2^{2k} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$ and $5 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{3}$ Thus $ 2^{2k} +5 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$ , so $3$ $\\mid$ $2^{n}+5$ $\\Rightarrow$ $ 3 \\mid 5^{n}-3^{n}$ , which is a contradiction ! $\\Rightarrow$ n is odd How ever , $2^{n}+5$ will divide $5^{n}-3^{n} \\Rightarrow 5^n \\equiv 3^n \\pmod{2^{n}+5}$ $\\Rightarrow \\displaystyle \\left( \\frac{5^n}{2^{n}+5} \\right)$ $=$ $\\displaystyle \\left( \\frac{3^n}{2^{n}+5} \\right)$ $\\Rightarrow \\displaystyle \\left( \\frac{5}{2^{n}+5} \\right)^n =  \\displaystyle \\left( \\frac{3}{2^{n}+5} \\right) ^n$ Since n is odd $\\Rightarrow \\displaystyle \\left( \\frac{5}{2^{n}+5} \\right) =  \\displaystyle \\left( \\frac{3}{2^{n}+5} \\right)$ Now using the extended law of quadratic reciprocity with the Jacobi symbol , if a and b are odd positive coprime integers then : $\n\\displaystyle \\left( \\frac{a}{b} \\right) = (-1)^{\\frac{(a-1)(b-1)}{4}}$ $\\displaystyle \\left( \\frac{b}{a} \\right)$ In our case $5$ and $2^n + 5$ are odd positive coprime integers , also for $3$ and $2^n +5$ . Thus $\\displaystyle \\left( \\frac{5}{2^{n}+5} \\right) = \\displaystyle \\left( \\frac{2^{n}+5}{5} \\right) \\times (-1)^{\\frac{5-1}{2} \\times \\frac{2^{n}+5-1}{2}} = \\displaystyle \\left( \\frac{2^{n}+5}{5} \\right)$ because $\\frac{5-1}{2} =2$ $\\Rightarrow \\displaystyle \\left( \\frac{2^{n}+5}{5} \\right) = \\displaystyle \\left( \\frac{2^{n}}{5} \\right)$ because $\\text{if } a \\equiv b \\pmod{c}, \\text{ then } \\displaystyle \\left( \\frac{a}{c} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{b}{c} \\right)$ $\\Rightarrow  \\displaystyle \\left( \\frac{2^{n}}{5} \\right) = \\displaystyle \\left( \\frac{2}{5} \\right)^n = (-1)^{\\frac{5^2-1}{8}} = (-1)^3 = -1$ In the other hand , using the extended law of quadratic reciprocity, we have : $\\displaystyle \\left( \\frac{3}{2^{n}+5} \\right) = \\displaystyle \\left( \\frac{2^{n}+5}{3} \\right) \\times (-1)^{\\frac{3-1}{2} \\times \\frac{2^{n}+5-1}{2}} = \\displaystyle \\left( \\frac{2^{n}+5}{3} \\right) \\times (-1)^{\\frac{2^{n}+4}{2}}$ $= \\displaystyle \\left( \\frac{2^{n}+5}{3} \\right) \\times (-1)^{2^{n-1}+2} = \\displaystyle \\left( \\frac{2^{n}+5}{3} \\right)$ , because $n > 1$ $\\Rightarrow \\displaystyle \\left( \\frac{2^{n}+5}{3} \\right) = \\displaystyle \\left( \\frac{(-1)^{n}-1}{3} \\right) $ , since $5 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{3}$ and $2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{3}$ As n is odd, then $\\displaystyle \\left( \\frac{(-1)^{n}-1}{3} \\right) = \\displaystyle \\left( \\frac{-2}{3} \\right) = \\displaystyle \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right) = 1$ Thus $\\displaystyle \\left( \\frac{5^n}{2^{n}+5} \\right)$ $=$ $\\displaystyle \\left( \\frac{3^n}{2^{n}+5} \\right) = 1 =-1$ which is a contradiction ! Conclusion , $2^{n}+5$ will not divide $5^{n}-3^{n}$ but why $\\gcd\\left(2^{n}+5,5^{n}-3^{n}\\right)=1$ ? Thanks for help !",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $n_0$ be an odd integer such that $n_0 \\geq 3$ . Since $\\gcd(5, 3) = 1$ , by Zsigmondy’s theorem, $5^{n_0} - 3^{n_0}$ has a primitive prime divisor $p$ . In particular, $p$ is odd (since $p$ does not divide $5 - 3$ ) moreover $p \\neq 3$ , so $3$ has an inverse modulo $p$ . In the cyclic group $(F_p^*, \\times)$ where $F_p = \\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}$ , we have $\\frac{5}{3}$ of order $n_0$ : $O\\left(\\frac{5}{3}\\right) = n_0$ . Thus, $p \\mid 5^n - 3^n$ if and only if $n_0 \\mid n$ . To find $n$ such that $\\gcd(5^n - 3^n, 2^n + 5) > 1$ , it suffices that $n = (2k + 1)n_0$ and $p \\mid 2^n + 5$ . In $(F_p^{*},\\times)$ : $$2^{(2k+1)n_0} + 5 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad (4^{n_0})^k = -\\frac{5}{2^{n_0}} ,$$ where $2^{n_0}$ is invertible modulo $p$ (since $p$ is odd). Thus, we have $-\\frac{5}{2^{n_0}} \\in \\text{gr}(4^{n_0})$ , where $\\text{gr}(4^{n_0})$ denotes the subgroup of $(F_p)^*$ generated by $4^{n_0}$ . We recall that , in a cyclic group, $x \\in \\text{gr}(a)$ if and only if $o(x)$ divides $o(a)$ . Thus, $$-\\frac{5}{2^{n_0}} \\in \\text{gr}(4^{n_0}) \\quad \\Leftrightarrow \\quad o\\left(-\\frac{5}{2^{n_0}}\\right) \\mid o(4^{n_0}).$$ Conclusion: To find the existence of an odd $n$ such that $\\gcd(5^n - 3^n, 2^n + 5) > 1$ , follow these steps: Start with $n_0 = 3$ . If a primitive divisor $p$ of $5^{n_0} - 3^{n_0}$ is found such that $o\\left(-\\frac{5}{2^{n_0}}\\right)$ divides $o(4^{n_0})$ , then we are done. Otherwise, replace $n_0$ by $n_0 + 2$ and repeat the process. For $n_0 = 25$ , we verify the factorization of $5^{n_0} - 3^{n_0}$ as: $$5^{n_0} - 3^{n_0} = 131 \\times 2 \\times 11 \\times p,$$ where $p = 103408180634401$ . Since $5^5 - 3^5 = 2 \\times 11 \\times 131$ , $p$ is a primitive prime divisor of $5^{n_0} - 3^{n_0}$ and $o\\left(\\frac{5}{3}\\right) = 25$ in $(F_p^*, \\times)$ . Additionally, we have $o\\left(-\\frac{5}{2^{n_0}}\\right) = 43086741931$ , and $o(4^{n_0}) = 517040903172 = 12 \\times o\\left(-\\frac{5}{2^{n_0}}\\right)$ . Thus, there exists a $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $-\\frac{5}{2^{n_0}} = (4^{n_0})^k$ , and hence $n = n_0(2k + 1)$ answers the question. Remark , there is infinitely odd numbers n such that $\\gcd(5^n-3^n,2^n+5) \\neq 1$ In fact, it suffices to replace $k$ by $k'=k+m\\times(p-1)$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this problem. The original question is about proving that the gcd of 2^n +5 and 5^n -3^n is 1 when n is an odd positive integer. The user has tried to show that 2^n +5 doesn't divide 5^n -3^n using Jacobi symbols and quadratic reciprocity, leading to a contradiction, which they think is sufficient. But they're confused why the gcd is 1, not just that 2^n +5 doesn't divide 5^n -3^n.\n\nFirst, I need to structure the problem according to the given format. The example provided lists assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. The problem here is to prove gcd(2^n +5, 5^n -3^n) =1 when n is an odd positive integer. \n\nLooking at the original problem, the key assumptions are:\n1. n is an odd positive integer. \n\nThe problem statement is the conjecture itself. The user's attempt includes several steps, but for the formatted problem, we need to extract the essential assumptions. The user mentions that n is odd, so that's the main assumption. The problem is to prove the gcd is 1. \n\nWait, in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem here, the user states \"if n is an odd positive integer\", so the main assumption is that n is odd and positive. The problem is to prove the gcd is 1. \n\nBut in the example, they listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as two separate assumptions. So here, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nn is odd.\n\nProblem:\nProve that gcd(2^n +5, 5^n -3^n) =1.\n\nBut wait, the original problem's title is \"Conjecture: If n is an odd positive integer then gcd(2^{n}+5,5^{n}-3^{n})=1.\" So the assumptions are that n is an odd positive integer, and the problem is to prove the gcd is 1. The user's attempt shows that 2^n +5 does not divide 5^n -3^n, but they're confused why the gcd is 1. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list the assumptions as n being a positive integer and n being odd. Each as separate lines. The problem is to prove the gcd is 1. \n\nI think that's it. The example had two assumptions for the same variable (integer and divisible by 7), so here similarly, two assumptions: positive integer and odd.",
