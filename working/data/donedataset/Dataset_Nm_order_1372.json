    "Content": "I guess the proof of the identity\n$$\n\\sum_{n = 0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n!} \\equiv \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{x}\\right)^x\n$$\nexplains the connection between such different calculations. How is it done?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This identity, in isolation, is certainly confusing. It becomes less so once you know that it is just a special case of a more general identity $$\\sum_{n \\ge 0} \\frac{x^n}{n!} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left( 1 + \\frac{x}{n} \\right)^n.$$ Why does this hold? Well, let's call the function on the left $e^x$. Then by inspection, $\\frac{d}{dx} e^x = e^x$. General theory tells you that the solution to $y' = y$ is unique provided you fix the value of $y(0)$ (and this is also physically intuitive), and here $e^0 = 1$ by inspection, so that tells you that $e^x$ is the unique function satisfying $e^0 = 1$ and $\\frac{d}{dx} e^x = e^x$. Chandru1's deleted answer reminded me that the proof of this is actually completely elementary. Suppose $f$ is a function which satisfies $f'(x) = f(x)$. Then $$\\frac{d}{dx} \\left( e^{-x} f(x) \\right) = e^{-x} f'(x) - e^{-x} f(x) = 0$$ hence $e^{-x} f(x) = C_f$ for some constant $C_f$. Substituting $f(x) = e^x$ gives $e^{-x} e^x = C$, and substituting $x = 0$ gives $e^{-x} e^x = 1$. Now it follows that $f(x) = C_f e^x$. Why does the function on the RHS also satisfy this property? Let's call this function $\\exp(x)$. Then $$\\exp(cx) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left( 1 + \\frac{cx}{n} \\right)^n = \\lim_{m \\to \\infty} \\left( 1 + \\frac{x}{m} \\right)^{mc} = \\exp(x)^c$$ where $m = \\frac{n}{c}$. Setting $c = 1 + \\frac{y}{x}$, this gives $$\\exp(x + y) = \\exp(x)^{1 + \\frac{y}{x}} = \\exp(x) \\exp(x)^{ \\frac{y}{x} } = \\exp(x) \\exp(y)$$ from which it follows that $$\\frac{d}{dx} \\exp(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{\\exp(x) \\exp(h) - \\exp(x)}{h} = \\exp(x) \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{\\exp(h) - 1}{h}$$ so it follows that $\\exp(x)$ satisfies $\\exp(0) = 1$ and $\\frac{d}{dx} \\exp(x) = \\exp(x)$, which means it must equal $e^x$ - at least, as soon as we know that $$\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{\\exp(h) - 1}{h} = 1.$$ But $$\\exp(h) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left( 1 + \\frac{h}{n} \\right)^n = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left( 1 + {n \\choose 1} \\frac{h}{n} + {n \\choose 2} \\frac{h^2}{n^2} + ... \\right) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left( 1 + h + R(h, n) \\right)$$ where $|R(h, n)| \\le \\sum_{k \\ge 2} |h|^k = O(|h|^2)$ by the ratio test, from which the conclusion follows. That last step, by the way, is an echo of the standard proof, where one expands $$\\left( 1 + \\frac{x}{n} \\right)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^n {n \\choose k} \\frac{x^k}{n^k}$$ and uses the fact that $\\frac{1}{n^k} {n \\choose k} \\to \\frac{1}{k!}$ as $n \\to \\infty$. While this is fairly hands-on, in my opinion it obscures an underlying principle behind this problem, which is that $e^x$ is a very special function and all of the equivalent ways of defining it are based on one of its special properties. One really nice way to interpret the above identity is that it is precisely what you get by applying Euler's method to the ODE $y' = y$ with initial conditions $y(0) = 1$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem as per the required format. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement from the given Math Stack Exchange question.\n\nThe title is about different methods resulting in the same number, e. The question mentions the identity between an infinite series and a limit: the sum from n=0 to infinity of 1/n! equals the limit as x approaches infinity of (1 + 1/x)^x. The user is asking how this connection is proven, which explains why different methods give the same result, e.\n\nSo, the problem is to prove the equivalence of these two expressions defining e. Now, for the assumptions. The original problem doesn't explicitly state assumptions, but in mathematical proofs, there are often implicit assumptions. For example, the variable x is approaching infinity, which is a limit condition. Also, the series is an infinite sum, so convergence is assumed. However, since the problem is to prove the equivalence, maybe the key assumptions are the definitions or properties of e, but the user hasn't stated any. Since the example given in the problem didn't have assumptions but had to infer them, perhaps here we need to list the mathematical conditions given in the problem.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the original problem mentioned that n is an integer and divisible by 7. The formatted problem listed those as assumptions. Similarly, here, the problem involves the sum from n=0 to infinity of 1/n! and the limit as x approaches infinity of (1 + 1/x)^x. The assumptions here might be about the convergence of the series and the limit, but since the problem is to show their equality, maybe the key is that both expressions are definitions of e. However, the user is asking how the proof connects these two different calculations. So perhaps the assumptions are the definitions themselves. Wait, but in the example, the assumptions included that n is an integer and divisible by 7, which were part of the problem's given conditions. Here, the problem doesn't state any conditions beyond the expressions themselves. Maybe there are no explicit assumptions, but in the problem statement, the variables are defined as n being a summation index and x approaching infinity. So perhaps the assumptions are related to the variables' domains. For example, n is a non-negative integer in the series, and x is a real number approaching infinity. But the problem doesn't specify those; they are implicit in the notation. The example included the assumption that n is an integer, so maybe here similar implicit assumptions are needed. Let me think. The sum from n=0 to infinity of 1/n! is a standard series for e, and the limit is the standard limit definition. The problem is to prove they are equal. So maybe the assumptions are that n is an integer in the summation, and x is a real number approaching infinity in the limit. Also, the convergence of the series and the existence of the limit. But the user is asking for the proof connecting these, so perhaps the assumptions are the definitions of e via series and via limit. However, the problem is to show their equivalence, so perhaps the assumptions are the expressions themselves. Wait, but in the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, perhaps the key is that n is an integer in the summation, and x is a real number in the limit. So listing those as assumptions.\n\nSo, possible assumptions:\n\n- The summation variable n is a non-negative integer.\n- The limit variable x approaches infinity through real numbers.\n- The series ∑_{n=0}^∞ 1/n! converges.\n- The limit lim_{x→∞} (1 + 1/x)^x exists.\n\nBut the problem as stated in the question is to prove the equivalence between these two expressions. The original problem didn't state these as assumptions but as the problem itself. However, in the example, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7, which were part of the problem's given conditions. Here, the problem is to show the equivalence, so maybe the assumptions are the conditions under which the equality holds. Since the equality is between two expressions that both define e, the assumptions might be the standard mathematical definitions or the convergence of the series and the existence of the limit. But perhaps the user is taking these as given and wants to show the connection. The question is asking \"how is it done?\" meaning the proof. Therefore, the assumptions would be the definitions or the contexts in which these expressions are considered. However, in the example, the assumptions were explicit in the problem statement. Here, the problem is just to prove the identity between the sum and the limit. Therefore, the assumptions might not be explicitly stated but inferred. Since the example included the conditions on n, here, maybe the assumptions are that n is an integer in the summation and x is a real number approaching infinity. Let me check the original example again. In the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", so the formatted assumption listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So the assumptions were taken directly from the problem's conditions. Here, the problem states \"the identity ∑_{n=0}^∞ 1/n! ≡ lim_{x→∞} (1 + 1/x)^x\". The problem is to prove this identity. Therefore, the assumptions might be that n is a non-negative integer in the summation, and x is a real number approaching infinity. However, in mathematical analysis, the limit as x approaches infinity is usually over real x, but sometimes also considered over integer x. But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps the assumption is that x approaches infinity through real numbers. Therefore, the formatted problem would have assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a non-negative integer,\nx is a real number approaching infinity.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum_{n = 0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n!} \\equiv \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{x}\\right)^x.$$\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to show that both expressions equal e, so perhaps the assumptions are that both expressions are definitions of e. But I think the user wants the assumptions based on the problem statement. Since the problem is to prove the identity between the sum and the limit, the assumptions would be the conditions under which the sum and limit are defined. So, the convergence of the series and the existence of the limit. However, in the example, the assumptions were more about the variables (n being integer, divisible by 7). Here, similarly, variables: n is a non-negative integer in the sum, x is a real number approaching infinity. The problem is to show that these two expressions are equal. So those would be the assumptions.",
