    "Content": "Let $0\\le p_i \\le 1$ for $i = 1,2,\\dots n.$ Show that $\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n \\dfrac{1}{|x-p_i|}\\le 8n\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n \\dfrac{1}{2i-1}$ for some $x,0\\le x \\le 1.$ First, it seems reasonable to convert the RHS to a closed form. I know $\\dfrac{\\pi}{4}=\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty (-1)^{i-1}\\dfrac{1}{2i-1},$ but I don't think that will be useful for this problem. Also, I don't think the LHS can be simplified using a telescoping series. I think I should pick several candidates $x_j$ and then take $\\displaystyle\\sum_{j=1}^n \\dfrac{1}{|x_j-p_j|}.$ I should probably also consider different intervals of $[0,1].$ Any help would be appreciated.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I think I should pick several candidates $x_j$ Something along those lines. Take an average. If that average is not larger than the right hand side, it follows that there is an $x$ for which the left hand side is not larger than the right hand side. Now the question is what average we should consider. Obviously considering $$\\int_0^1 \\sum_{j = 1}^n \\frac{1}{\\lvert x - p_j\\rvert}\\,dx = +\\infty$$ doesn't work here. Thus let's cut out short intervals around the $p_j$ and look at what that yields. For $0 < \\varepsilon < 1$ and $p \\in [0,1]$ define $A(p,\\varepsilon) = \\{x \\in [0,1] : \\lvert x - p\\rvert \\geqslant \\varepsilon\\}$ , and then set $$I(\\varepsilon) = \\bigcap_{j = 1}^n A(p_j,\\varepsilon).$$ For small enough $\\varepsilon$ this is a union of finitely many nondegenerate intervals, thus $$M(\\varepsilon) = \\int_{I(\\varepsilon)}dx > 0,$$ and I claim that for $\\varepsilon = \\frac{1}{4n}$ the average $$\\frac{1}{M(\\varepsilon)} \\int_{I(\\varepsilon)} \\sum_{j = 1}^n \\frac{1}{\\lvert x - p_j\\rvert}\\,dx$$ is no larger than $8n \\sum_{j = 1}^n \\frac{1}{2j-1}$ , thus there are $x \\in I(\\varepsilon)$ satisfying the desired inequality. First, to obtain $I(\\varepsilon)$ we remove $n$ intervals of length at most $2\\varepsilon$ (at most, not necessarily exactly, because there may be $p_j \\in [0,\\varepsilon)$ or in $(1-\\varepsilon,1]$ ). These may overlap, so $M(\\varepsilon)$ cannot be exactly determined unless the $p_j$ are explicitly given, but we have the simple bound $$M(\\varepsilon) \\geqslant 1 - n\\cdot 2\\varepsilon,$$ in particular $M(\\frac{1}{4n}) \\geqslant \\frac{1}{2}$ . Further, for $0 < \\varepsilon \\leqslant \\frac{1}{4}$ and $p \\in [0,1]$ we have $$\\int_{A(p,\\varepsilon)} \\frac{dx}{\\lvert x-p\\rvert} \\leqslant 2\\log \\frac{1}{2\\varepsilon}.$$ If $\\varepsilon < p < 1 - \\varepsilon$ , then \\begin{align}\n\\int_{A(p,\\varepsilon)} \\frac{dx}{\\lvert x - p\\rvert}\n&= \\int_0^{p-\\varepsilon} \\frac{dx}{p-x} + \\int_{p + \\varepsilon}^1 \\frac{dx}{x-p} \\\\\n&= -\\log \\varepsilon + \\log p + \\log (1-p) - \\log \\varepsilon \\\\\n&= 2\\log \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon} + \\log \\bigl(p(1-p)\\bigr) \\\\\n&\\leqslant 2\\log \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon} + \\log \\frac{1}{4} \\\\\n&= 2\\log \\frac{1}{2\\varepsilon}\n\\end{align} since $0 \\leqslant p(1-p) \\leqslant 1/4$ . If $0 \\leqslant p \\leqslant \\varepsilon$ , then \\begin{align}\n\\int_{A(p,\\varepsilon)} \\frac{dx}{\\lvert x-p\\rvert}\n&= \\int_{p+\\varepsilon}^1 \\frac{dx}{x-p} \\\\\n&= \\log (1-p) - \\log \\varepsilon \\\\\n&\\leqslant \\log \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon} \\\\\n&\\leqslant 2\\log \\frac{1}{2\\varepsilon},\n\\end{align} where in the last inequality we used $\\varepsilon \\leqslant 1/4$ . For $1 - \\varepsilon \\leqslant p \\leqslant 1$ the claim follows similarly (by symmetry, if you want). Thus we have, setting $\\delta = \\frac{1}{4n}$ , \\begin{align}\n\\frac{1}{M(\\delta)}\\int_{I(\\delta)} \\sum_{j = 1}^n \\frac{1}{\\lvert x - p_j\\rvert}\\,dx\n&\\leqslant 2\\int_{I(\\delta)} \\sum_{j = 1}^n \\frac{1}{\\lvert x - p_j\\rvert}\\,dx \\\\\n&= 2\\sum_{j = 1}^n \\int_{I(\\delta)} \\frac{dx}{\\lvert x - p_j\\rvert} \\\\\n&\\leqslant 2\\sum_{j = 1}^n \\int_{A(p_j,\\delta)} \\frac{dx}{\\lvert x - p_j\\rvert} \\\\\n&\\leqslant 2\\sum_{j = 1}^n 2\\log \\frac{1}{2\\delta} \\\\\n&= 4n\\log (2n).\n\\end{align} Together with $$\\sum_{j = 1}^n \\frac{2}{2j-1} \\geqslant \\sum_{j = 1}^n \\int_{2j-1}^{2j+1} \\frac{dx}{x} = \\log (2n+1) > \\log (2n)$$ the assertion follows.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to format this problem according to the user's instructions. The original question is about showing that the sum of 1 over |x - p_i| is less than or equal to 8n times the sum of 1/(2i-1) for some x between 0 and 1. The user provided an example where assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions in the problem. The problem states that for each i from 1 to n, p_i is between 0 and 1 inclusive. So each p_i is an individual point in [0,1]. That's one assumption per p_i, but since there are n of them, maybe it's better to state it generally. Wait, the example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. So here, the key assumptions would be that each p_i is in [0,1], and that x is also in [0,1]. But the problem states \"for some x, 0 ≤ x ≤ 1\", so the existence of such an x is part of the problem statement, not an assumption.\n\nWait, the assumptions should be the given conditions. So the problem's assumptions are that each p_i is in [0,1]. The conclusion is that there exists an x in [0,1] such that the sum of 1/|x - p_i| is bounded by 8n times the sum of 1/(2i-1). So the assumptions are about the p_i's and the domain of x. The problem is to prove the inequality for some x in [0,1].\n\nBut in the example, the assumption included both the domain of n and a divisibility condition. So here, each p_i must satisfy 0 ≤ p_i ≤ 1. Since there are n p_i's, but they are all covered under the same condition. However, the example listed each assumption line by line. So maybe here, the main assumption is that each p_i is in [0,1]. So:\n\nAssumption: For each i = 1, 2, ..., n, 0 ≤ p_i ≤ 1.\n\nBut the example had two separate lines: \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So in this case, perhaps each p_i's condition is a separate assumption. But since they are all similar, maybe it's written as a single assumption: For all i = 1, 2, ..., n, p_i is in [0,1]. But the example used separate lines even for the same object. Wait, no, in the example, the first assumption was about n being an integer, the second about n being divisible by 7. So different properties of the same object. Here, each p_i has the same property. So maybe the assumption is written as a single line: Each p_i is in [0,1].\n\nSo the problem is to show that under these assumptions, there exists an x in [0,1] such that the sum is bounded by 8n times the other sum.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nFor each i = 1, 2, ..., n, 0 ≤ p_i ≤ 1.\nProblem:\nShow that there exists an x with 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 such that $$\\sum_{i=1}^n \\dfrac{1}{|x-p_i|} \\le 8n \\sum_{i=1}^n \\dfrac{1}{2i-1}.$$\n\nWait, but in the example, they listed each assumption line by line. If all the p_i's are in [0,1], perhaps each is a separate assumption? But that would be n assumptions, which isn't practical. So the correct way is to state the assumption as a universal statement over all i. So in the example, the user wrote \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate lines. Here, the assumption is that each p_i is in [0,1], so that's a single line. Therefore, the correct format would be:\n\nAssumption:\nFor each i = 1, 2, ..., n, 0 ≤ p_i ≤ 1.\n\nProblem:\nShow that there exists an x with 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 such that $$\\sum_{i=1}^n \\dfrac{1}{|x-p_i|} \\le 8n \\sum_{i=1}^n \\dfrac{1}{2i-1}.$$\n\nYes, that seems to fit the example. The key is to list each assumption as a separate line, even if they apply to multiple objects as long as each line addresses one property or condition. Here, the single line covers all p_i's with their condition. The example had two separate conditions on n, so two lines. Here, all p_i's have the same condition, so one line.",
