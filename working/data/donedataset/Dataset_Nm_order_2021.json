    "Content": "Let $m$ and $n$ be positive integers. Show that $$4mn-m-n$$ can never be a square. In my attempt I started by assuming for the sake of contradiction that $$4mn-m-n=k^2$$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{N_0^+}$. Then I considered $k^2 \\pmod3$  (I couldn't find a way for $\\pmod4$ or $\\pmod8$ to help)\n$$k^2 \\equiv 0,1 \\pmod3$$ This yield three possibilities for $m$ and $n$ $\\pmod3$ either $$m,n \\equiv 0 \\pmod3$$ $$m \\equiv 0,\\;\\;\\;n \\equiv 2 \\pmod3 \\; \\; \\;(WLOG)$$ $$m,n \\equiv 2 \\pmod3$$  Case $1$:   $m,n \\equiv 0 \\pmod3$ Let $m=3m'$ and $n=3n'$ then $k^2=36m'n'-3m'-3n'$ Hence $3|k^2 \\implies 3|k$ Let $k=3k'$ then $$9k'^2=36m'n'-3m'-3n'$$\n$$\\implies3k'^2=12m'n'-m'-n'$$ Here I'm stuck and don't know if anything I've done is helpful and don't feel inclined to pursue the other cases given what happened here. I was hoping to reduce this to some sort of infinite descent argument - that didn't happen. I now think that my approach was probably completely wrong. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Assume on the contrary that $4mn-m-n=k^2$. Then $(4m-1)(4n-1)=(2k)^2+1$. Since $4m-1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$ and $4m-1>0$, $4m-1$ has a prime factor $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$. Then $p \\mid (2k)^2+1$, which gives a contradiction since $(\\frac{-1}{p})=(-1)^{\\frac{p-1}{2}}=-1$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The goal is to show that for positive integers m and n, the expression 4mn - m - n can never be a perfect square. \n\nFirst, the user attempted to use modulo 3 analysis. Let me verify if that's a good approach. They set 4mn - m - n = k² and considered the equation modulo 3. Let's see: 4mn modulo 3 is equivalent to (1)mn because 4 ≡ 1 mod 3. So the expression becomes mn - m - n ≡ k² mod 3. Then, rearranging, mn - m - n + 1 ≡ k² + 1 mod 3. That becomes (m - 1)(n - 1) ≡ k² + 1 mod 3. Hmm, maybe that's a different way to look at it. But maybe the user considered different cases for m and n modulo 3.\n\nThey considered three cases: both m and n ≡0 mod3, one 0 and the other 2 mod3, or both ≡2 mod3. Let me check each case. For example, if both m and n are multiples of 3, say m=3m', n=3n', substituting into the equation gives 4*(3m')*(3n') -3m' -3n' = 36m'n' -3m' -3n'. Then setting that equal to k², they factor out a 3: 3(12m'n' -m' -n') =k². So 3 divides k², hence 3 divides k. Let k=3k', then substituting back gives 9k'² = 3(12m'n' -m' -n'), simplifying to 3k'² =12m'n' -m' -n'. Now this equation resembles the original but with smaller variables, suggesting an infinite descent? But the user got stuck here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another modulus could be more effective. The user tried modulo 3, but mentioned they couldn't find a way with modulo 4 or 8. Let me check modulo 4. Let's compute 4mn - m -n mod4. The term 4mn is 0 mod4. So the expression becomes -m -n mod4. So - (m +n) ≡ k² mod4. The possible squares mod4 are 0 and 1. So -(m +n) ≡ 0 or 1 mod4. Therefore, m +n ≡0 or 3 mod4. So for the expression to be a square, m +n must be congruent to 0 or 3 modulo4. This gives a condition on m and n. But does this lead to a contradiction? Maybe combining modulo 3 and modulo4 conditions.\n\nWait, maybe trying modulo 5 or another modulus? Let me see. Alternatively, rearrange the original equation. Let's suppose 4mn -m -n =k². Let me try to express this as (4m -1)(4n -1) =4k² +1. Wait, expanding (4m -1)(4n -1) gives 16mn -4m -4n +1. But our expression is 4mn -m -n. If I multiply both sides of the original equation by 4, we get 16mn -4m -4n =4k². Then adding 1 to both sides gives 16mn -4m -4n +1=4k² +1, which is (4m -1)(4n -1)=4k² +1. Hmm, so we have (4m -1)(4n -1) ≡1 mod4 because 4k² +1 ≡1 mod4. But both factors (4m -1) and (4n -1) are congruent to 3 mod4, since 4m is 0 mod4, subtract 1 gives 3 mod4. So the product is 3*3=9≡1 mod4, which matches. So that's consistent. But how does this help? Maybe considering factors of 4k² +1. Note that 4k² +1 is a number of the form x² + y² if k is even or odd, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, since 4k² +1 is a prime of the form 4l+1? Not necessarily. Alternatively, note that the equation (4m -1)(4n -1)=4k² +1 implies that the two factors on the left must be divisors of 4k² +1. Since 4k² +1 is a product of primes congruent to 1 mod4 or 2. Wait, primes dividing 4k² +1 must be congruent to 1 mod4, because if a prime p divides 4k² +1, then 4k² ≡ -1 mod p, so (2k)² ≡ -1 mod p, which implies that -1 is a quadratic residue mod p, so p≡1 mod4. Therefore, 4k² +1 factors into primes all ≡1 mod4. But (4m -1) and (4n -1) are both ≡3 mod4, so their product is ≡1 mod4, which is okay, but each factor is ≡3 mod4. However, primes ≡3 mod4 must appear an even number of times in the factorization of a number that is a sum of two squares, but here 4k² +1 is of the form x² + (2k)², but wait, 4k² +1 is not a sum of two squares unless k=0. Wait, but 4k² +1 = (2k)^2 +1^2, so it is a sum of two squares. So according to Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares, all prime factors of 4k² +1 must be ≡1 mod4 or 2. But primes ≡3 mod4 cannot divide it. Wait, but we have (4m -1) and (4n -1) as factors, which are ≡3 mod4. If these factors are composite, their prime factors must include primes ≡3 mod4. But 4k² +1 cannot have any prime factors ≡3 mod4. Contradiction! Therefore, this suggests that the equation (4m -1)(4n -1)=4k² +1 cannot hold because the left side would have factors ≡3 mod4, which cannot divide the right side. Therefore, the original equation 4mn -m -n =k² is impossible. \n\nWait, that seems like a valid argument. Let me check this again. So if (4m -1)(4n -1)=4k² +1, and since 4k² +1 is a sum of two squares (2k,1), then all prime factors of 4k² +1 must be ≡1 mod4 or 2. However, the left-hand side (4m -1)(4n -1) is a product of two numbers ≡3 mod4. Each of these factors, 4m -1 and 4n -1, must be a product of primes where any prime ≡3 mod4 appears an even number of times. But since each factor is ≡3 mod4, they must each have an odd number of prime factors ≡3 mod4. Wait, but if a number is ≡3 mod4, then it must have at least one prime factor ≡3 mod4, and since 3 mod4 primes multiplied together give 3*3=1 mod4, so if there's an odd number of 3 mod4 primes, the product is 3 mod4. But our factors (4m -1) and (4n -1) are each ≡3 mod4, so each must have an odd number of primes ≡3 mod4. Therefore, their product would have an even number of primes ≡3 mod4, but since 4k² +1 cannot have any prime factors ≡3 mod4 (as shown earlier), this is a contradiction. Hence, the original equation cannot hold. Therefore, 4mn -m -n cannot be a square. \n\nSo this approach using the sum of squares and properties of primes modulo4 might be the key. The user tried modulo3 but didn't consider modulo4 deeply. Alternatively, the key insight is transforming the equation into a product form that leads to a contradiction regarding prime factors. Therefore, the problem's assumptions are that m and n are positive integers, and the problem is to show that 4mn -m -n is never a square.",
