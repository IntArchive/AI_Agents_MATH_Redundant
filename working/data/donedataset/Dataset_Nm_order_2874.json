    "Content": "Let G be a finite solvable group, and assume that $\\Phi(G) = 1$ where $\\Phi(G)$ denotes the Frattini subgroup of G. Let M be a maximal subgroup of G, and suppose that $H \\subseteq M$ . Show that $G$ has a subgroup with index equal to $|M:H|$ . This is question 3B.12 from Finite Group Theory, by M. Isaacs. Here is my approach so far. I am completely stuck and would welcome any hints or ideas. Suppose otherwise. Among all of the counter examples choose $G$ of minimum order. Since $G$ is a counterexample it must be the case that $|G| > 1$ . Since $G$ is a counter example there is a maximum subgroup $M$ and a subgroup $H \\subset M$ , such that every subgroup of $G$ does not have the same index as $|M:H|$ . So it must be the case that $H$ is properly contained within $M$ . This is where I get stuck. I want to use a minimal normal subgroup $N$ of $G$ which exists. But my argument devolves into a series of cases about whether or not $N$ intersects $H$ and/or $M$ non-trivially. I do know that $G$ must have a non-normal maximal subgroup, since if they all were normal then it would be nilpotent and since G is finite this implies supersolvable, then $G$ would have a subgroup for any divisor of its order. Since $\\Phi(G)=1$ is the intersection of all the maximal subgroups of $G$ I suspect this should help but I'm not sure where to go from here.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "$G=\\mathrm{Alt}(4)$ , $M=C_2^2$ , $H=C_2$ is a counterexample, as $\\mathrm{Alt}(4)$ doesn't have a subgroup of order $6$ . This seems like a mistake in the book.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to help structure this problem according to the specified format. Let's start by reading through the original question carefully.\n\nThe user provided an example where they formatted a problem into Assumptions and Problem sections. The task is to do the same for the given Math Stack Exchange question.\n\nFirst, the original problem is about finite solvable groups with trivial Frattini subgroup. The goal is to show that if M is a maximal subgroup of G and H is a subgroup contained in M, then G has a subgroup with index equal to |M:H|.\n\nLooking at the example, the assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. So in this case, the assumptions are:\n\n1. G is a finite solvable group.\n2. Φ(G) = 1 (the Frattini subgroup is trivial).\n3. M is a maximal subgroup of G.\n4. H is a subgroup of G such that H ⊆ M.\n\nThe problem statement then is to show that G has a subgroup with index equal to |M:H|.\n\nWait, but in the original question, the user mentions \"This is question 3B.12 from Finite Group Theory, by M. Isaacs.\" But in the example, the source (like the book reference) was included in the Problem section. So maybe the problem statement should include the reference? Wait, in the example, the original problem had \"Prove that for every integer n...\" and the formatted problem included the problem statement without mentioning the source. So maybe the source is considered unrelated information for the formatted problem. So the Problem section should just state the mathematical problem, not the source.\n\nAlso, the user's own approach and thoughts are part of the original question but should be filtered out as unrelated information. So the Assumptions and Problem should be extracted from the problem statement, not the user's attempt.\n\nSo, let's parse the original question:\n\nTitle: Index of subgroups in a finite solvable group, with trivial Frattini subgroup (Exercise 3B.12 from Finite Group Theory, by M. Isaacs)\n\nQuestion: Let G be a finite solvable group, and assume that Φ(G) = 1 where Φ(G) denotes the Frattini subgroup of G. Let M be a maximal subgroup of G, and suppose that H ⊆ M. Show that G has a subgroup with index equal to |M:H|.\n\nSo the key components:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n1. G is a finite solvable group.\n2. Φ(G) = 1 (Frattini subgroup is trivial).\n3. M is a maximal subgroup of G.\n4. H is a subgroup contained in M (H ⊆ M).\n\nProblem: Show that G has a subgroup with index equal to |M:H|.\n\nI need to check if each assumption is a single property applied to one object. Let's see:\n\n1. \"G is a finite solvable group\" – yes, applies to G.\n2. \"Φ(G) = 1\" – applies to G's Frattini subgroup, but phrased as a property of G (since Φ(G) is a subgroup of G).\n3. \"M is a maximal subgroup of G\" – applies to M.\n4. \"H is a subgroup contained in M\" – applies to H and its relation to M. Wait, but the original problem states \"H ⊆ M\". So maybe split into two? No, because \"H is a subgroup of G\" and \"H is contained in M\". But in the original problem, H is a subgroup of M, which is a subgroup of G. So H is a subgroup of G contained in M. So maybe the assumption is \"H is a subgroup of M\". But the problem says \"H ⊆ M\". So the assumption is H is a subgroup contained in M. However, in mathematical terms, H being a subgroup of M (since M is a subgroup of G) implies H is a subgroup of G. So the assumptions are:\n\n- G is a finite solvable group.\n- Φ(G) = 1.\n- M is a maximal subgroup of G.\n- H is a subgroup of M.\n\nEach of these is a single condition applied to one object. So the four assumptions.\n\nThe problem is to show that G has a subgroup with index equal to |M:H|.\n\nNow, the example given by the user had in the original problem a mention that n is an integer, and in the formatted problem, they listed \"$n$ is an integer\", \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, the assumption was n is an integer, n is divisible by 7, and the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which changes the problem. Maybe the example was incorrect, but according to the user's instruction, we need to follow the format as per their example. However, in their example, they restructured the problem, possibly adding an assumption that wasn't originally there. Wait, actually, looking at the original example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut that seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds that n must be divisible by 7. However, maybe the user intended to filter out the conditions. Wait, perhaps in the example, the user made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps in the original problem, the user mistyped. Wait, perhaps the example is hypothetical. Regardless, the instruction is to follow the example's format, which seems to list all the assumptions from the problem, each as a separate line, addressing one property per line.\n\nBut in the current problem, the original problem states:\n\nLet G be a finite solvable group, assume Φ(G)=1, let M be a maximal subgroup of G, and suppose H ⊆ M. Show that G has a subgroup with index equal to |M:H|.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are exactly as above. So each line in the Assumption section is:\n\n- G is a finite solvable group.\n\n- Φ(G) = 1.\n\n- M is a maximal subgroup of G.\n\n- H is a subgroup of M.\n\nProblem: Show that G has a subgroup with index equal to |M:H|.\n\nI think that's correct. The user's own thoughts about minimal normal subgroups, counterexamples, etc., are part of their attempt and should be filtered out. The title includes the book reference, which is part of the original question's title, but in the example, the problem was stated without the source, so we can include the problem statement without mentioning the book.\n\nSo the formatted problem should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nG is a finite solvable group,\nΦ(G) = 1,\nM is a maximal subgroup of G,\nH is a subgroup of M.\nProblem:\nShow that G has a subgroup with index equal to |M:H|.\n###",
