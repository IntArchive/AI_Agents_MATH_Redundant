    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual mathematics professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement from the original question.\n\nFirst, let me read the original question carefully. The title is \"Proof of 'Dual normed vector space is complete'\". The question body mentions that according to Wikipedia, the dual normed space X' is always complete. The user is asking how to prove this or at least explain it. They note that normed vector spaces aren't always complete, but dual spaces are.\n\nNow, I need to parse this into the Assumption and Problem sections. The example given lists each assumption as a single line, addressing one property per object. \n\nLooking at the problem, the key points are:\n1. The dual space X' is a normed vector space.\n2. The dual space X' is complete, hence a Banach space.\n3. The original space X might not be complete, but its dual is always complete.\n\nThe problem statement is to prove that the dual normed vector space X' is complete. \n\nFor assumptions, I need to list the conditions given. The original problem states that X' is a dual normed space. The fact that it's a dual space implies that X is a normed vector space, and X' consists of all continuous linear functionals on X. The norm on X' is the dual norm. However, the original problem doesn't specify any additional conditions on X except that it's a normed vector space. The key assumption here is that X is a normed vector space, and X' is its dual with the dual norm. \n\nWait, the example given in the user's instruction had assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But in the current problem, the main assumption is that X is a normed vector space. The dual space X' is automatically a normed space with the dual norm. The problem is to show that X' is complete regardless of X being complete or not. So the assumptions here are:\n\n- X is a normed vector space.\n- X' is the dual space of X (i.e., the space of continuous linear functionals on X).\n- X' is equipped with the dual norm.\n\nBut in the original question, the user is referring to the statement that the dual normed space is always complete. So the assumption is just that X is a normed vector space, and X' is its dual with the dual norm. The problem is to prove that X' is complete (hence a Banach space).\n\nSo structuring this:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a normed vector space,\nX' is the dual space of X (i.e., the space of continuous linear functionals on X),\nX' is equipped with the dual norm.\n\nProblem:\nProve that X' is complete.\n\nBut the example provided by the user had two assumptions, each on a separate line, each addressing one property. So maybe each bullet point here would be an assumption line.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem had the assumption that n is an integer, and then another assumption that n is divisible by 7. However, in the problem presented here, the main structure is about the dual space. The key assumption is that X is a normed vector space. The other points (X' being dual, equipped with dual norm) are part of the problem setup, not additional assumptions.\n\nBut maybe the problem is that the user wants each assumption to be a single condition on a single object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a normed vector space,\nX' is the dual space of X,\nX' is equipped with the dual norm.\n\nProblem:\nProve that X' is complete.\n\nBut I need to check if there are more implicit assumptions. For example, the dual space is defined as the space of continuous (i.e., bounded) linear functionals. So maybe another assumption is that the functionals in X' are continuous. However, that's part of the definition of the dual space. Since the problem is to structure the given question, I should extract only the assumptions mentioned or necessary. The original question says \"dual normed vector space is complete\", so the main assumption is that X is a normed vector space, and X' is its dual with the dual norm. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a normed vector space,\nX' is the dual space of X (i.e., the space of continuous linear functionals on X),\nX' is equipped with the dual norm.\n\nProblem:\nProve that X' is complete.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first assumption is that X is a normed vector space, and the second is that X' is its dual space with the dual norm. But since the problem is about X', maybe the key assumption is just that X is a normed vector space, because the dual space and its norm are standard constructs. However, to be thorough, perhaps all three lines are necessary.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might just be: given a normed vector space X, prove that its dual space X' (with the dual norm) is complete. In that case, the assumptions are:\n\n- X is a normed vector space.\n\nBecause the dual space X' and the dual norm are part of the problem's setup. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a normed vector space.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the dual space X', equipped with the dual norm, is complete.\n\nBut in the example given, the user split the assumptions into multiple lines even when they were part of the problem's setup. For instance, in the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. Both were listed separately. So perhaps here, the assumption is that X is a normed vector space, and X' is its dual space with the dual norm. So:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a normed vector space,\nX' is the dual space of X,\nX' is equipped with the dual norm.\n\nProblem:\nProve that X' is complete.\n\nBut perhaps \"X' is equipped with the dual norm\" is part of the problem's setup and not an assumption. However, in the example, the problem setup (A(n) expression) was part of the problem statement, and the assumptions were n being integer and divisible by 7. So perhaps in this case, the only assumption is that X is a normed vector space. The rest (X' being dual space with dual norm) is part of the problem's statement.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"dual normed vector space is complete\". The question is to prove that the dual normed space is complete. So the problem is about the dual space of a normed vector space, and the assumption is that X is a normed vector space. The problem is to prove that X' (the dual) is complete. So perhaps the correct formatting is:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a normed vector space.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the dual normed space X' is complete.\n\nBut to adhere to the example, maybe the assumption should break down each condition. However, since X being a normed vector space is a single condition, that's one assumption. The problem then is to prove X' is complete. Alternatively, if the problem requires that X' is a dual normed space, then perhaps that's part of the problem statement. But according to the example, the problem statement includes the expression A(n), and the assumptions are separate.\n\nIn the example, the original problem had an expression involving 5^n and 6^n, and the assumption was n is integer and divisible by 7. So the problem statement in the formatted version included the expression again, but under the problem section. So here, perhaps the problem statement is \"Prove that the dual normed space X' is complete,\" and the assumption is \"X is a normed vector space.\"\n\nBut maybe I need to check if the problem mentions any other conditions. The original question says \"dual normed vector space is complete,\" and the user is asking how to prove it. The user knows that normed vector spaces aren't always complete but the dual is. So the key here is that regardless of X being complete or not, X' is complete. So the only assumption is that X is a normed vector space. The dual space's completeness is the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a normed vector space.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the dual normed space X' is complete.\n\nBut perhaps more precise: The dual space X' is the space of continuous linear functionals with the dual norm. So maybe the assumptions need to mention that X' is the dual space with the dual norm. But since that is part of the definition, maybe it's included in the problem statement. Alternatively, the problem could be phrased as \"Prove that the dual space X' of a normed vector space X, equipped with the dual norm, is complete.\" But according to the example, the problem statement can include mathematical expressions, so perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a normed vector space.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the dual space X', equipped with the dual norm, is complete.\n\nAlternatively, to make the problem statement self-contained, the assumptions are X is a normed vector space, and the problem is proving X' is complete. The rest (dual norm) is part of the problem's context. However, to be precise, the problem is about the dual space with the dual norm. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a normed vector space.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the dual normed vector space X' is complete.\n\nBecause \"dual normed vector space\" implies that it's equipped with the dual norm. That seems sufficient.
