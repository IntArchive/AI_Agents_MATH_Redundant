    "Content": "In my lecture notes they use the fact, that every supermartingale $(M_t)$ for which the map $t\\mapsto E[M_t]$ is constant is already a martingale. Unfortunately I can't prove it. Some help would be appreciated. By definition of a supermartingale we have: $E[M_0]\\ge E[M_s]\\ge E[M_t]$ for $t\\ge s\\ge 0$.\nI also know that $M_s\\ge E[M_t|\\mathcal{F}_s]$. If I would take expectation I  would get an equality by assumption. However I do not see how this helps here to prove $M_s= E[M_t|\\mathcal{F}_s]$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Fix $t\\geq s$. Then $M_s-E[M_t\\mid M_s]$ is a non-negative random variable. Its expectation is \n$$E[M_s]-E[E[M_t\\mid M_s]]=E[M_s]-E[M_t]=0$$\nby assumption. A non-negative random variable $X$ with $0$ expectation is $0$ almost everywhere, since \n$$P(X\\geq 2^{-n})\\leq 2^nE X=0.$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual mathematics professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me start by carefully reading the original problem and understanding what needs to be done.\n\nFirst, the original problem is about proving that a supermartingale with constant expectation is a martingale. The user provided an example where assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. My task is to filter out unrelated information and structure the problem accordingly.\n\nLooking at the example given, the key was to extract the assumptions from the problem statement. In the example, the original problem mentioned that A(n) should be divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem included an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem might have had a hidden assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the given example, the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. However, in the original problem statement provided in the example, it just says \"for every integer n\". So maybe in the actual problem, there was a hidden condition or perhaps a mistake in the example. But regardless, I need to focus on the current problem.\n\nThe current problem from Math Stack Exchange is titled \"Supermartingale with constant Expectation is a martingale\". The question states that in the lecture notes, they used the fact that every supermartingale (M_t) for which the map t ↦ E[M_t] is constant is already a martingale. The user is asking for help to prove this. They mention that by definition of a supermartingale, E[M_0] ≥ E[M_s] ≥ E[M_t] for t ≥ s ≥ 0. They also note that M_s ≥ E[M_t | F_s], and taking expectation would give equality by assumption, but they don't see how this leads to M_s = E[M_t | F_s].\n\nSo, the task is to structure this problem into the Assumption and Problem sections. Let's parse the problem.\n\nFirst, the assumptions. The problem is about a supermartingale (M_t) with constant expectation. So the key assumptions here are:\n\n1. (M_t) is a supermartingale.\n2. The map t ↦ E[M_t] is constant.\n\nThese are the two main assumptions. Each should be a separate line. The first assumption is about the process being a supermartingale. The second is about the expectation being constant over time.\n\nThe problem statement is to prove that (M_t) is a martingale. So the problem part is straightforward.\n\nBut wait, in the original question, the user also mentions \"By definition of a supermartingale we have: E[M_0] ≥ E[M_s] ≥ E[M_t] for t ≥ s ≥ 0.\" However, this is part of the properties of a supermartingale. Since we already assume that (M_t) is a supermartingale, these inequalities are inherent to the definition. But the key additional condition here is that the expectation is constant. So the two assumptions are (M_t) is a supermartingale, and E[M_t] is constant for all t.\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\nAssumption:\n- (M_t) is a supermartingale.\n- The map t ↦ E[M_t] is constant.\n\nProblem:\nProve that (M_t) is a martingale.\n\nWait, but in the example provided by the user, the original problem had some conditions, and the formatted problem listed the assumptions. So in this case, the problem is to prove that the supermartingale (M_t) with constant expectation is a martingale. The assumptions are that it's a supermartingale and that the expectation is constant.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list these two assumptions. Let me check the original question again:\n\n\"In my lecture notes they use the fact, that every supermartingale (M_t) for which the map t↦E[M_t] is constant is already a martingale.\"\n\nSo the problem is: Given a supermartingale (M_t) where the expectation E[M_t] is constant over t, prove that (M_t) is a martingale.\n\nHence, the assumptions are:\n\n1. (M_t) is a supermartingale.\n2. For all t, E[M_t] is constant (i.e., does not depend on t).\n\nThese should be listed as two separate assumptions. Each assumption addresses one property applied to one object. The first is about (M_t) being a supermartingale, the second about its expectation being constant.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- (M_t) is a supermartingale.\n- The function t ↦ E[M_t] is constant.\n\nProblem:\nProve that (M_t) is a martingale.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"every supermartingale (M_t) for which the map t ↦ E[M_t] is constant is already a martingale.\" So the problem is to prove that under these two conditions, (M_t) is a martingale. Therefore, the assumptions are exactly those two points.\n\nI think that's it. Let me make sure there are no other assumptions. The user mentions \"By definition of a supermartingale we have: E[M_0] ≥ E[M_s] ≥ E[M_t] for t ≥ s ≥ 0.\" But if the expectation is constant, then all these inequalities become equalities. Hence, the key is that the supermartingale's expectation is non-increasing, but if it's constant, then it must be a martingale. The assumptions needed are just the supermartingale property and the constant expectation. No other hidden conditions are mentioned.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be as follows.",
