    "Content": "A table $n\\times n$ is filled with pairwise different natural numbers. Ann and Ben are playing the following game: Ann chooses the greatest number, then crosses out the row and the column containing it. She then chooses the greatest number from what is remained and repeats the whole process unless table is crossed out completely. Ben takes exactly the same table, and repeats the same process, but choosing the least number on each step. We need to show that the sum $A$ of numbers chosen by Ann is greater (or equal) to the sum $B$ of numbers chosen by Ben. I think it should be done via presenting such $C$ that $A\\geq C\\geq B$ .\nHowever, if $a_i$ and $b_i$ are the numbers chosen by Ann and Ben on $i$ -th step respectively, the inequality $a_i\\geq b_{n-i+1}$ does not hold. So, I am stuck at this point.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $a_1,a_2\\dots a_n$ be the numbers selected by Ann and $b_1,b_2,\\dots b_n$ be the numbers selected by Benjamin. Lemma: $a_i\\geq b_{n+1-i}$ for all $1\\leq i \\leq n$ . Proof: Consider the set $A$ of all numbers that were eligible when we selected $a_i$ and the set $B$ of all the numbers eligible when we selected $b_{n+1-i}$ . Notice that these two sets intersect (because $n-i+1$ rows are eligible in $A$ and $i$ rows are eligible in $B$ , and the same happens with the columns) so the claim is true, since $a_i=\\max(A)$ and $b_i=\\min B$ . The problem follows from the lemma: $\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n a_i \\geq \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n b_{n+1-i} = \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n b_i$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions. The original question is about a game played by Ann and Ben on an n×n table filled with distinct natural numbers. The goal is to show that Ann's sum A is at least as big as Ben's sum B.\n\nStarting with the assumptions. The problem mentions an n×n table. So the first assumption is that the table is square with size n×n. Then, all the numbers in the table are pairwise different natural numbers. So that's another assumption—each number is distinct and a natural number.\n\nNext, the game rules. Ann selects the greatest number each time, then crosses out its row and column. She repeats this until the table is completely crossed out. Similarly, Ben does the same process but picks the smallest number each time. These are separate steps. So Ann's strategy is to always pick the current maximum, remove its row and column, and continue. Ben does the opposite, picking the minimum each time.\n\nThe problem requires showing that the sum A (Ann's total) is greater than or equal to sum B (Ben's total). The user tried to find an intermediate C such that A ≥ C ≥ B but got stuck because the inequality between individual steps didn't hold.\n\nSo, the assumptions need to list each condition applied to one object. Let me list them:\n\n1. The table is n×n in size.\n2. All numbers in the table are natural numbers.\n3. All numbers in the table are pairwise distinct.\n4. Ann selects the greatest remaining number on each step.\n5. After selecting a number, Ann crosses out its entire row and column.\n6. Ann repeats the selection and crossing out until all numbers are crossed out.\n7. Ben selects the least remaining number on each step.\n8. After selecting a number, Ben crosses out its entire row and column.\n9. Ben repeats the selection and crossing out until all numbers are crossed out.\n10. The sum A is the total of numbers selected by Ann.\n11. The sum B is the total of numbers selected by Ben.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement says \"We need to show that A is greater or equal to B\". The problem part is that. The user also mentions their attempt but that's part of the question, not the problem itself. So the problem as per the user is: \"We need to show that the sum A of numbers chosen by Ann is greater (or equal) to the sum B of numbers chosen by Ben.\"\n\nNow, structuring this into the required format. Each assumption should be a single line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let's check:\n\n- The table is n×n. (Assumption 1)\n- The table contains pairwise distinct natural numbers. (Assumptions 2 and 3 combined? Wait, original problem states \"pairwise different natural numbers\". So that's two properties: natural numbers and pairwise distinct. But maybe it's considered as a single condition. Hmm. But according to the example given, \"pairwise different\" is a separate condition. In the example, the original problem had \"pairwise different natural numbers\"—so perhaps in the example, the user split them into \"natural numbers\" and \"pairwise different\". Wait, in the example provided by the user, the original problem's assumptions were:\n\nOriginal problem's formatted assumption:\nAssumption: n is an integer,\nn is divisible by 7.\n\nSo, each line is a separate condition. So in this case, \"pairwise different natural numbers\" would be split into two: \"All numbers are natural numbers\" and \"All numbers are pairwise distinct.\"\n\nSo here, the assumptions should be:\n\n1. The table is n×n.\n2. All numbers in the table are natural numbers.\n3. All numbers in the table are pairwise distinct.\n4. Ann selects the greatest remaining number on each step.\n5. Ann crosses out the row and column containing the selected number after each selection.\n6. Ann repeats the selection and crossing out until the table is completely crossed out.\n7. Ben selects the least remaining number on each step.\n8. Ben crosses out the row and column containing the selected number after each selection.\n9. Ben repeats the selection and crossing out until the table is completely crossed out.\n10. Sum A is the sum of numbers selected by Ann.\n11. Sum B is the sum of numbers selected by Ben.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"Ann and Ben are playing the following game: Ann chooses the greatest number, then crosses out the row and column containing it. She then chooses the greatest number from what is remained and repeats the whole process unless table is crossed out completely. Ben takes exactly the same table, and repeats the same process, but choosing the least number on each step.\"\n\nSo, perhaps \"exactly the same table\"—so the initial table is the same for both. So another assumption could be \"Ann and Ben use the same initial table.\" But the problem statement mentions that explicitly: \"Ben takes exactly the same table...\". So that's an important assumption: that both players start with the same table. So that should be an assumption: \"Ann and Ben use the same initial table.\"\n\nSo adding that as an assumption. Let me check again:\n\nOriginal problem statement:\n\n\"A table n×n is filled with pairwise different natural numbers. Ann and Ben are playing the following game: Ann chooses the greatest number, then crosses out the row and column containing it. She then chooses the greatest number from what is remained and repeats the whole process unless table is crossed out completely. Ben takes exactly the same table, and repeats the same process, but choosing the least number on each step. We need to show that the sum A of numbers chosen by Ann is greater (or equal) to the sum B of numbers chosen by Ben.\"\n\nSo the assumptions here are:\n\n- The table is n×n.\n- The table is filled with pairwise different natural numbers. (This can be split into two: natural numbers and pairwise distinct.)\n- Ann's strategy: choose greatest, cross out row and column, repeat.\n- Ben's strategy: choose least, cross out row and column, repeat.\n- They use the same initial table.\n\nSo structured as:\n\nAssumption:\nThe table is n×n,\nAll numbers in the table are natural numbers,\nAll numbers in the table are pairwise distinct,\nAnn and Ben use the same initial table,\nOn each step, Ann selects the greatest remaining number,\nAfter selecting a number, Ann crosses out its row and column,\nAnn repeats the process until all numbers are crossed out,\nOn each step, Ben selects the least remaining number,\nAfter selecting a number, Ben crosses out its row and column,\nBen repeats the process until all numbers are crossed out,\nSum A is the total of numbers selected by Ann,\nSum B is the total of numbers selected by Ben.\n\nBut some of these are redundant. For example, \"Sum A\" and \"Sum B\" are part of the problem statement's definitions, not assumptions. The problem is to show A >= B, so the existence of A and B is part of the problem, not the assumptions. The assumptions are the conditions given for the problem.\n\nTherefore, the correct assumptions are:\n\n1. The table is n×n.\n2. All numbers in the table are natural numbers.\n3. All numbers in the table are pairwise distinct.\n4. Ann and Ben use the same initial table.\n5. Ann's process: select greatest remaining number, cross out its row and column, repeat until all crossed out.\n6. Ben's process: select least remaining number, cross out its row and column, repeat until all crossed out.\n\nBut to split into single conditions per line:\n\n- The table has dimensions n×n.\n- Each number in the table is a natural number.\n- All numbers in the table are pairwise distinct.\n- Ann and Ben play on the same initial table.\n- Ann selects the greatest remaining number on each step.\n- Ann crosses out the row and column of the selected number after each selection.\n- Ann continues the process until the entire table is crossed out.\n- Ben selects the least remaining number on each step.\n- Ben crosses out the row and column of the selected number after each selection.\n- Ben continues the process until the entire table is crossed out.\n\nThis seems more detailed. Each action is separated. So, each line is a single assumption. That's how the example was structured. For example, in the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are separate lines.\n\nSo applying that, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe table is n×n,\nAll numbers in the table are natural numbers,\nAll numbers in the table are pairwise distinct,\nAnn and Ben use the same initial table,\nOn each step, Ann selects the greatest remaining number,\nAnn crosses out the row and column containing the selected number after each selection,\nAnn repeats the selection and crossing out until all numbers are crossed out,\nOn each step, Ben selects the least remaining number,\nBen crosses out the row and column containing the selected number after each selection,\nBen repeats the selection and crossing out until all numbers are crossed out.\n\nThen, the problem is: Show that the sum A (of numbers chosen by Ann) is greater than or equal to the sum B (of numbers chosen by Ben).\n\nSo putting this together:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nThe table is n×n,\nAll numbers in the table are natural numbers,\nAll numbers in the table are pairwise distinct,\nAnn and Ben use the same initial table,\nOn each step, Ann selects the greatest remaining number,\nAnn crosses out the row and column containing the selected number after each selection,\nAnn repeats the selection and crossing out until all numbers are crossed out,\nOn each step, Ben selects the least remaining number,\nBen crosses out the row and column containing the selected number after each selection,\nBen repeats the selection and crossing out until all numbers are crossed out.\nProblem: \nShow that the sum of numbers chosen by Ann is greater than or equal to the sum of numbers chosen by Ben.\n###END_OF_FORMAT###\n\nI need to check if all assumptions are covered. The problem states that the numbers are different, natural, same table, and the processes for Ann and Ben. Each step is broken down into individual lines. The problem part is the final statement to prove. The example used a similar structure, breaking down each condition. So this should be correct.",
