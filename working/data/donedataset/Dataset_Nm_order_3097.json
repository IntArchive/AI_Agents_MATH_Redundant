    "Content": "Let $X$ be a normed linear space with two norms $||\\cdot||_1$ and $||\\cdot||_2$.\nProve or disprove that this statements are equivalent: $||\\cdot||_1$ and $||\\cdot||_2$ are equivalent, $\\{x_n\\}$ converges in $||\\cdot||_1$ iff $\\{x_n\\}$ converges in $||\\cdot||_2\\;\\; $   $\\forall \\{x_n\\}\\in X$ The first implies the second trivially because of equivalence of topologies. But it implies something more: sequence converges to the same element in both norms. But I don't have such condition. Is this a necessary condition to converge to the same in both norms, or this is just a consequent of \"if and only if\" in the statement of convergence, or there is a example disproving the equivalence?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Suppose $\\|\\cdot\\|_1$ and $\\|\\cdot\\|_2$ are inequivalent, so one is unbounded with respect to the other; WLOG $\\|\\cdot\\|_2$ is unbounded with respect to $\\|\\cdot\\|_1$.  That means you can find a sequence $x_n$ with $\\|x_n\\|_1 \\leq 1$ for all $n$ but $\\|x_n\\|_2 \\geq n$.  Let $y_n = \\frac{x_n}{\\sqrt{n}}$.  Then $y_n \\to 0$ in $\\|\\cdot\\|_1$, but $\\|y_n\\|_2 \\to \\infty$.  So, for inequivalent norms you can always find a sequence which converges to 0 in one norm, but goes to infinity (hence doesn't converge to anything) in the other.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so the user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. Let me first read through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe title is \"How convergence relates to equivalence of norms\". The question is about proving or disproving whether two statements are equivalent. The first statement is that two norms ||·||₁ and ||·||₂ on a normed linear space X are equivalent. The second statement is that for every sequence {x_n} in X, convergence in ||·||₁ if and only if convergence in ||·||₂. The user also mentions some thoughts about whether converging to the same element is necessary or just a consequence.\n\nNow, I need to structure this into the Assumption and Problem sections as per the example. The assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. The original problem states that X is a normed linear space with two norms, so that's one assumption. Then, the problem is to prove or disprove the equivalence of the two statements about the norms and convergence.\n\nWait, in the example provided, the assumption included specific conditions on the object. Here, the problem is about two norms on X and the convergence of any sequence. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- X is a normed linear space.\n- ||·||₁ and ||·||₂ are two norms on X.\n- The problem is to determine if equivalence of norms is equivalent to the convergence of sequences in one norm iff the other.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption line should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So breaking it down:\n\nAssumption:\n- X is a normed linear space.\n- ||·||₁ is a norm on X.\n- ||·||₂ is a norm on X.\n- For all sequences {x_n} in X, {x_n} converges in ||·||₁ if and only if it converges in ||·||₂.\n\nWait, no. The problem is to prove or disprove that the two statements are equivalent. The two statements are:\n\n1. ||·||₁ and ||·||₂ are equivalent.\n2. For every sequence {x_n} in X, {x_n} converges in ||·||₁ iff it converges in ||·||₂.\n\nSo the assumptions are just the setup: X is a normed linear space with two norms. The problem is to show equivalence between the two statements.\n\nSo structuring that:\n\nAssumption:\n- X is a normed linear space.\n- ||·||₁ is a norm on X.\n- ||·||₂ is a norm on X.\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that the following statements are equivalent:\n1. ||·||₁ and ||·||₂ are equivalent.\n2. For every sequence {x_n} in X, {x_n} converges in ||·||₁ if and only if it converges in ||·||₂.\n\nBut wait, the original question mentions \"this statements are equivalent\" and the user is confused about whether the convergence to the same element is required. However, in the problem as stated, the second condition only requires that convergence in one norm implies convergence in the other, but not necessarily to the same limit. However, the user is pointing out that equivalence of norms implies that limits are the same, but the problem here doesn't specify that. So the problem as presented is whether the equivalence of convergence (regardless of the limit) is equivalent to the norms being equivalent. The user is questioning if the convergence to the same element is necessary, but the problem as posed does not include that condition.\n\nTherefore, the problem is exactly as stated: equivalence of norms vs. equivalence of convergence (without requiring same limit). So the formatted problem should capture that.\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n- X is a normed linear space.\n- ||·||₁ is a norm on X.\n- ||·||₂ is a norm on X.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that the following statements are equivalent:\n1. ||·||₁ and ||·||₂ are equivalent.\n2. For every sequence {x_n} in X, {x_n} converges in ||·||₁ if and only if {x_n} converges in ||·||₂.\n\nBut in the example given by the user, the assumptions included specific conditions on n. Here, the problem is more general. The key is to list all the assumptions. Since the problem is about a normed space with two norms, each norm is an assumption on X. So breaking them down into separate lines.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a normed linear space,\n||·||₁ is a norm on X,\n||·||₂ is a norm on X.\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that the following statements are equivalent:\n1. ||·||₁ and ||·||₂ are equivalent.\n2. For every sequence {x_n} in X, {x_n} converges in ||·||₁ if and only if {x_n} converges in ||·||₂.\n\nI think that's correct. The user's original problem doesn't mention any additional constraints, so the assumptions are just the existence of the two norms on the space X. The problem is to check the equivalence between norm equivalence and convergence equivalence.",
