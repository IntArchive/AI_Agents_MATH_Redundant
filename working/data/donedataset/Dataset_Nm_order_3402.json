    "Content": "I am a graduate student at Iowa State University attempting to return after a five-year hiatus and take the Real/Complex Analysis qualifier on January 8 for potential reinstatement. Since the professors here are on hiatus, I hope you guys don't mind if I bombard the board with a few past questions from our quals here, like this one from Spring 2013: Let $m$ denote Lebesgue measure on $\\mathbb R$ and $M$ the $\\sigma$-algebra of Lebesgue measurable subsets. Given $E \\in M$ with $m(E) > 0$ and $\\alpha \\in (0, 1)$, prove that there is an interval $I$ such that $m(E \\cap I) > \\alpha \\, m(I)$. I've attempted to force the issue using the definition of outer measure but it doesn't seem to work. I've also attempted using the definition of Lebesgue measurability but that doesn't seem to work either - so I'm at a loss! Thanks in advance! -Darrin Rasberry",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The Lebesgue density theorem states that for almost every point $x \\in E$ with $m(E) > 0$,\n$$\n\\lim_{\\epsilon\\to 0} \\frac{m(E \\cap B_\\epsilon(x))}{m(B_\\epsilon(x))} = 1.\n$$ Fix such $x$ and pick $\\epsilon$ such that\n$$\n\\frac{m(E \\cap B_\\epsilon(x))}{m(B_\\epsilon(x))} > \\alpha.\n$$ $I = B_\\epsilon(x)$ is the desired interval.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to structure this problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The original question is about Lebesgue measure and finding an interval where the measure of the intersection with a set E is greater than alpha times the measure of the interval. \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem mentions that E is in M, which is the sigma-algebra of Lebesgue measurable subsets. Also, m(E) is greater than 0, and alpha is between 0 and 1. The problem states to prove there exists an interval I such that m(E ∩ I) > alpha * m(I). \n\nSo the assumptions should be each a single condition applied to one object. Let me break it down:\n\n1. E is an element of M (the sigma-algebra of Lebesgue measurable subsets).\n2. m(E) is greater than 0.\n3. α is a real number in the interval (0,1).\n\nThe problem is to prove that there exists an interval I such that the measure of E intersect I is greater than alpha times the measure of I. \n\nI need to check if the original problem had any other assumptions. The title mentions \"set of positive measure E\", so that's covered by m(E) > 0. The alpha is in (0,1). The measure is Lebesgue measure on R. So the assumptions are correct. Each one is a separate line, each addressing one property. \n\nThen the problem statement is as given. So the formatted problem should have those three assumptions and the problem statement. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The user example had the assumptions listed line by line, each with one condition. Yes, that's right. So the answer should be:\n\nAssumption:\nE is a Lebesgue measurable set (E ∈ M),\nm(E) > 0,\nα ∈ (0, 1).\nProblem:\nProve that there exists an interval I such that m(E ∩ I) > α m(I).\n\nI think that's correct. Let me check again. The original problem says \"Given E ∈ M with m(E) > 0 and α ∈ (0,1), prove...\". So yes, those are the three assumptions. Each is a separate line. The problem is the conclusion. Alright, that's the structured problem as per the required format.",
