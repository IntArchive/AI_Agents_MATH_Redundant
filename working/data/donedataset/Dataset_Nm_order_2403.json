    "Content": "$x^3+\\dfrac{1}{x^3}$ and $x^4+\\dfrac{1}{x^4}$ are rational numbers. Prove that $x+\\dfrac{1}{x}$ is rational number. My solution: $x^3+\\dfrac{1}{x^3}=\\left(x+\\dfrac{1}{x}\\right)\\left(x^2+\\dfrac{1}{x^2}-1\\right)$ $x^4+\\dfrac{1}{x^4}=x^4+2+\\dfrac{1}{x^4}-2=\\left(x^2+\\dfrac{1}{x^2}\\right)^2-1-1=\\left(x^2+\\dfrac{1}{x^2}-1\\right)\\left(x^2+\\dfrac{1}{x^2}+1\\right)-1$ Because $x^4+\\dfrac{1}{x^4}$ is rational number so $\\left(x^2+\\dfrac{1}{x^2}-1\\right)$ is rational number too and $x^3+\\dfrac{1}{x^3}$ is rational number so $\\left(x+\\dfrac{1}{x}\\right)$ is rational number.

    "AcceptedAnswer": "As the commenters pointed out, a problem in your argument is that the implication\n\" $(x^4+x^{-4})$ is rational\" $\\implies$ \" $(x^2+x^{-2})$ is rational\" is false.\nFor example, it is possible that $x^2+x^{-2}=\\sqrt5$ when, by your tricks, $x^4+x^{-4}=(x^2+x^{-2})^2-2=3$ , a rational number. Of course, in this case $x^3+x^{-3}$ fails to be rational, but this underlines a problem in your logic. One commenter suggested using a contrapositive argument. This may be a possibility, but a bit delicate to manage. My favorite approach (that generalizes to several variants of this question) is somewhat high browed in the sense that it uses properties of algebraic field extensions. Outlining it for the benefit of the readers familiar with that theory. As $x^3+1/x^3=q_3\\in\\Bbb{Q}$ the number $x$ is a zero of the polynomial $P_3(T)=T^6-q_3T^3+1$ with rational coefficients. Therefore $x$ is an algebraic number. Let $m(T)\\in\\Bbb{Q}[T]$ be its minimal polynomial. The other zeros of $P_3(T)$ are $x^{\\pm1}\\omega^j$ , $\\omega=e^{2\\pi i/3}$ a primitive third root of unity, $j\\in\\{0,1,2\\}$ . Therefore the zeros of $m(T)$ are among these numbers. But, as $x^4+1/x^4=q_4\\in\\Bbb{Q}$ , $x$ is also a zero of the polynomial $P_4(T)=T^8-q_4T^4+1$ . The zeros of $P_4(T)$ are seen to be $x^{\\pm1}i^j$ , $j\\in\\{0,1,2,3\\}$ . The zeros of $m(T)$ are common zeros of both $P_3(T)$ and $P_4(T)$ , so they can only be $x^{\\pm1}$ . But $$r(T):=(T-x)(T-\\frac1x)=T^2-(x+\\frac1x)T+1.$$ Either $x$ is rational, when the claim is trivial, or $m(T)=r(T)$ , implying that the coefficients of $r(T)$ are rational. Here $x+\\dfrac1x$ is the coefficient of the linear term of $r(T)$ and we are done in this case as well. Toying with Mathematica gives the following elementary method. Write $u=x+\\dfrac1x$ . We are given that (see the linked thread) $$\nA=x^3+\\frac1{x^3}=u^3-3u\n$$ and $$\nB=x^4+\\frac1{x^4}=u^4-4u^2+2\n$$ are rational. Hence so is the quantity $$\n\\frac{A^3+AB-3A}{B^2-1}=u.\n$$ Explaining the reason why some formula like the one above writing $u$ in terms of $A$ and $B$ must exist. Let's treat $u$ as a variable, an element transcendental over $\\Bbb{Q}$ . Write $F=\\Bbb{Q}(u)$ for the field of rational functions. It has subfields $K_1=\\Bbb{Q}(A)$ and $K_2=\\Bbb{Q}(B)$ . We immediately see that the respective extension degrees are $[F:K_1]=3$ and $[F:K_2]=4$ . By the tower law, the only possibility is then that the compositum $K_1K_2=\\Bbb{Q}(A,B)$ must be all of $F$ . Consequently $u$ can be written as a rational function (with rational coefficients) in $A$ and $B$ . Observe that the representation is not unique, because $A$ and $B$ are algebraically dependent over $\\Bbb{Q}$ given that they both reside in the same transcendence degree one extension $F$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to structure the problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The original question is about proving that if x³ + 1/x³ and x⁴ + 1/x⁴ are rational, then x + 1/x is rational. The user also provided an example to follow.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that x³ + 1/x³ and x⁴ + 1/x⁴ are rational. So each of these should be separate assumptions. Also, since x can't be zero (because we're dividing by x³ and x⁴), maybe there's an implicit assumption that x ≠ 0. Wait, the original problem didn't mention x ≠ 0, but logically, if x is in the denominator, x can't be zero. Should I include that as an assumption? The example given in the problem didn't include such an implicit assumption, but maybe it's necessary here. Let me check the original problem again. The problem says \"Let x³ + 1/x³ and x⁴ + 1/x⁴ are rational numbers. Show that x + 1/x is rational.\" So the user didn't state x ≠ 0, but it's implied. Should I list it as an assumption? The example provided by the user didn't list implicit assumptions like n being an integer (which was part of the problem statement). Wait, in the example, the assumption was \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". But in the original problem here, maybe x is a real number? Or maybe complex? The problem didn't specify, but since we're dealing with rational numbers, it's likely x is a real number, and x ≠ 0. But the problem doesn't state that x is real. Hmm. But the user's example didn't mention the type of numbers. So perhaps in the assumptions, we should list what's given explicitly. The problem states that x³ +1/x³ and x⁴ +1/x⁴ are rational. So those are two separate assumptions. Also, maybe x is a non-zero real number? But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe the user expects only the given conditions. Wait, the problem as stated in the question is \"Prove that x +1/x is rational number\" given that x³ +1/x³ and x⁴ +1/x⁴ are rational. So the assumptions are those two expressions being rational. However, in the user's example, they included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But in the original problem here, there's no such condition on x except the given expressions. Wait, but x must be non-zero to have 1/x. So maybe x ≠ 0 is an implicit assumption. Should I include that? The example didn't include such implicit assumptions. For instance, in the example, the problem was about n being an integer, and the user included that as an assumption. The original problem here doesn't specify x's nature, but maybe we can assume x is a real number and x ≠ 0. But the problem might work over complex numbers as well. However, since the expressions are rational numbers, which are real, it's implied that x is a real number. But the user might not want to assume that unless stated. Wait, the problem says \"are rational numbers\", so x must be such that x +1/x is real? Because if x is complex, then x +1/x could be complex even if the expressions are rational. But maybe the problem is in the context of real numbers. Hmm. But the user's example didn't include such implicit assumptions. So perhaps in this case, the assumptions are only the two given in the problem: x³ +1/x³ is rational and x⁴ +1/x⁴ is rational. The problem is to show that x +1/x is rational. So the assumptions are just those two expressions being rational. However, to avoid division by zero, x ≠0, but maybe the user considers that as part of the problem's premise without listing it as a separate assumption. Let me check the example again. In the example, the assumption was \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". The original problem stated \"for every integer n\", so the user split it into two assumptions. But here, the original problem doesn't state anything about x except the two expressions. So perhaps the assumptions are just those two. But let me check the user's solution attempt. The user wrote their solution, mentioning expressions involving x +1/x. So x +1/x is defined, which requires x ≠0. Therefore, the problem assumes x ≠0. Should that be an assumption? The example didn't include such, but maybe here we should. The user might expect to list all necessary conditions. So the assumptions would be:\n\n1. x is a non-zero real number (since 1/x is defined),\n2. x³ +1/x³ is rational,\n3. x⁴ +1/x⁴ is rational.\n\nBut the original problem didn't state that x is real. However, since the expressions are rational, which are real, x must be real or a complex number such that the expressions evaluate to rationals. But if x is complex, then x +1/x being rational (a real number) would require that the imaginary part cancels out. This complicates things. Therefore, it's safer to assume that x is a real number. But the problem didn't specify. However, in the absence of specification, maybe we should assume x is a real number. But how to handle this? The user's example didn't specify the domain of n, but the original problem stated \"for every integer n\", so the assumption was listed. Here, the problem doesn't specify, so maybe the only assumptions are the two given expressions being rational, and x ≠0 is implicit. However, to be thorough, perhaps x ≠0 should be an assumption. But in the example, the user didn't include, for example, that 5 and 6 are integers or anything. So maybe the user wants only the explicitly stated assumptions. Let me re-examine the original problem statement:\n\n\"Let x³ +1/x³ and x⁴ +1/x⁴ are rational numbers. Show that x +1/x is rational.\"\n\nThe problem says \"Let...\", so the assumptions are those two expressions being rational. Therefore, the formatted problem's assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\nx³ + 1/x³ is a rational number,\nx⁴ + 1/x⁴ is a rational number.\n\nBut the problem also requires that x ≠0 to define 1/x. Therefore, should x ≠0 be an assumption? The user's example didn't include implicit assumptions like n being an integer if it was part of the problem statement, but in the example, the problem stated \"for every integer n\", so the user listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. Here, the problem doesn't state that x is non-zero, but it's necessary. Therefore, perhaps it's better to include x ≠0 as an assumption. However, in the original problem, the user didn't mention x ≠0, but it's required. So, to follow the example's structure, which included all explicit conditions from the problem statement, here the problem statement doesn't mention x ≠0, but it's implied. Therefore, perhaps the user expects that x ≠0 is not listed as an assumption because it's not explicitly stated, but rather a necessary condition for the expressions to be defined. However, in the format, the instructions say \"All the assumptions of the problem should be listed line by line. Each assumption addresses only one property or condition, applied to one object\". Therefore, perhaps x ≠0 is an assumption because it's a necessary condition for the expressions to make sense. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. x ≠0,\n2. x³ +1/x³ is rational,\n3. x⁴ +1/x⁴ is rational.\n\nBut in the example, the user didn't include \"n is divisible by 7\" unless it was stated. Wait, the original problem in the example was: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem's assumption was \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that's incorrect. Wait, the original example's problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is n is an integer. But the formatted problem in the example added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like a mistake. Because the original problem was to prove for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like an error. Wait, the user's example might have been incorrect, but we need to follow their format. Wait, no, looking back, the example says:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that's incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so n is any integer, not necessarily divisible by 7. But the formatted problem added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Perhaps the user made an error in their example. But we need to follow their structure regardless. So in their example, they included both the general condition (n is integer) and an additional assumption (n divisible by 7), even though the original problem didn't have the latter. That suggests that perhaps the user's example is flawed. Therefore, maybe in the current problem, we should only list the assumptions explicitly given in the problem statement, even if there are implicit ones. But given that the example included an extra assumption not present in the original problem, perhaps the user wants to list all necessary conditions, even if some are implicit. Wait, but in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", which changes the problem. That seems like an error. Maybe the user intended to modify the problem for the example. For instance, perhaps they wanted to structure a problem where the assumptions include n being an integer and divisible by 7, leading to proving divisibility by 91. But 91 is 13*7, so maybe they intended to have n divisible by both 7 and 13, but the example is confusing. Anyway, focusing on the current problem. The user's task is to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original question is: Let x³ +1/x³ and x⁴ +1/x⁴ are rational. Prove that x +1/x is rational.\n\nFollowing the user's example, even if flawed, we should list the assumptions as given in the problem statement. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. x³ +1/x³ is a rational number,\n2. x⁴ +1/x⁴ is a rational number.\n\nEven though x ≠0 is necessary, if the user's example didn't include implicit assumptions, perhaps we shouldn't list it. However, in the problem statement, the expressions x³ +1/x³ and x⁴ +1/x⁴ require x ≠0. Therefore, maybe x ≠0 is an assumption. But the problem doesn't state it explicitly. So I'm conflicted. Let me check the user's instructions again: \"filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" So we need to filter unrelated information. The original problem's title and question don't mention x ≠0, but it's required. However, in the user's example, they included assumptions that were part of the problem statement. For example, \"for every integer n\" became \"n is an integer\". But in the example, the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, that's confusing. Maybe the user made a mistake in their example. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a condition that n is divisible by 7, but it's not clear. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to show that if n is an integer divisible by 7, then A(n) is divisible by 91. But the original problem was \"for every integer n\", so the formatted example seems incorrect. This suggests that perhaps the user's example is not reliable, but we have to follow the format as per their instructions.\n\nGiven that, perhaps in the current problem, we should only list the assumptions explicitly given in the problem statement, i.e., x³ +1/x³ and x⁴ +1/x⁴ are rational. Even though x ≠0 is necessary, if it's not mentioned, maybe omit it. Alternatively, include it as an implicit assumption. But the user's example included \"n is an integer\" which was part of the problem statement. So here, since the problem statement doesn't mention x ≠0, but it's required for the expressions to be defined, maybe we should include it as an assumption. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a non-zero real number,\nx³ + 1/x³ is a rational number,\nx⁴ + 1/x⁴ is a rational number.\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't say x is real. However, since we're dealing with rational numbers, which are real, it's implied. Therefore, including \"x is a non-zero real number\" as an assumption. But the original problem didn't state that. So perhaps the user expects only the given conditions. Alternatively, maybe the problem works over any field where the expressions make sense, but rational numbers are in the context of real numbers. This is getting complicated. To resolve, perhaps the safest way is to include the two given expressions being rational as assumptions, and x ≠0 as an implicit assumption. But the user's example didn't include implicit assumptions. Therefore, perhaps in this case, the formatted problem's assumptions are only:\n\nAssumption:\nx³ + 1/x³ is a rational number,\nx⁴ + 1/x⁴ is a rational number.\n\nAnd the problem is to show that x +1/x is rational. Therefore, the answer should be structured as:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nx³ + 1/x³ is a rational number,\nx⁴ + 1/x⁴ is a rational number.\nProblem: \nProve that $x + \\dfrac{1}{x}$ is a rational number.\n###\n\nBut wait, the original problem's title says \"Show that x +1/x is rational\", so that's the problem statement. The user's solution attempt starts by factoring x³ +1/x³ as (x +1/x)(x² +1/x² -1), and then manipulates x⁴ +1/x⁴. The user's solution claims that since x⁴ +1/x⁴ is rational, then (x² +1/x² -1) is rational, and since x³ +1/x³ is rational, then (x +1/x) must be rational. However, the user is asking if their solution is correct. So in terms of formatting, the user wants the problem structured into assumptions and problem. So the answer should include the two given conditions as assumptions, and the problem to prove x +1/x is rational.",
