    "Content": "I read in several places, including Wikipedia, that a tessellation of the plane by a single, convex, $n-$sided polygon is not possible for $n\\geq7$. I was not able to locate a proof, or a paper that discusses this. Maybe it is too trivial, but I am not able to figure it out myself. So I would like to ask you for help. Where can I find a proof for this? Also, I am interested in the mathematical background behind plane tiling (especially periodic), If you can suggest papers on the topic it would really help.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "See the comments for a discussion of some shortcomings of my answer. Alas, I don't know how to fix this :-( In a tessellation of the entire plane by convex tiles at least three tiles will meet in each corner of each tile. Therefore the average of inner angles of the tile cannot be higher than 120 degrees. The sum of the inner angles of an $n$ -gon is $(n-2)180$ . If $n>6$ , then their average $180(n-2)/n=180(1-\\frac2n)>180(1-\\frac26)=120$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to format the original question from Math Stack Exchange into the specified structure. The original question is about why a tessellation of the plane with a single convex polygon of 7 or more sides isn't possible. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The key points here are:\n\n1. The tessellation is of the plane.\n2. The polygon used is convex.\n3. The polygon has 7 or more sides.\n4. Only one type of polygon is used (since it's \"by a single\" polygon).\n\nEach assumption should be listed line by line, addressing one property per line. So, breaking it down:\n\n- The first assumption is about the tessellation being in the plane. That's a condition on the tiling's location.\n- The second is the convexity of the polygon. That's a property of the polygon.\n- The third is the number of sides being 7 or more. So, n ≥ 7.\n- The fourth is that it's a single polygon type, so only one shape is used without any other tiles.\n\nNow, the problem statement should be concise. The original question is asking for a proof or explanation of why this tessellation isn't possible. But in the example provided, the problem is phrased as \"Prove that...\", so I should structure the problem part similarly. \n\nWait, the original question also mentions they couldn't find a proof and are asking for references, but the formatted problem should focus on the mathematical problem itself, not the request for references. So the problem part should be the statement that needs proving: that such a tessellation isn't possible.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The tiling covers the plane without gaps or overlaps.\n- The tile is a convex polygon.\n- The polygon has 7 or more sides.\n- Only one type of tile is used.\n\nProblem: Prove that a tessellation of the plane by a single, convex polygon with 7 or more sides is not possible.\n\nI need to check if all the critical assumptions are covered. The original question mentions \"convex polygon of 7 or more sides\", so the assumptions include convexity, n ≥7, and single tile type. The tiling being of the plane is also essential. The example given in the user's previous formatting included assumptions on the objects involved (like n being an integer and divisible by 7). Here, the key conditions are on the polygon (convex, n≥7) and the tiling (plane, single tile). That should cover it.",
