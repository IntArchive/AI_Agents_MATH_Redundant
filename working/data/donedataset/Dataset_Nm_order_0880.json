    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the user's format. First, I need to read the original question carefully. The user provided an example where assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. \n\nThe problem here is about showing that the sum from n=0 to infinity of 1/[(3n+1)(3n+2)] equals π/(3√3). The original question mentions that they split the fraction into partial fractions: 1/(3n+1) - 1/(3n+2). Then they wanted to use the arctan series expansion but noted that arctan(x) can be written as a power series only when |x| ≤ 1, and since arctan(√3) = π/3, maybe they tried to relate the series to that.\n\nNow, I need to list the assumptions. The problem is an infinite series, so the main assumptions would relate to the convergence of the series or conditions on n. The summation starts at n=0 and goes to infinity, so n is a non-negative integer. Also, the terms involve denominators (3n+1)(3n+2), which are never zero for n ≥ 0, so each term is defined. However, do these need to be explicit assumptions? The example given in the user's example had assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" Here, perhaps the key assumptions are that n is a non-negative integer (since the sum starts at n=0) and that the series converges (which might be an implicit assumption for the sum to equal the given value). But maybe the convergence isn't listed as an assumption but rather a condition to be verified. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes the series converges and asks to find its sum. However, in the original problem statement, the user wants to show the sum equals π/(3√3), so the convergence is part of what needs to be established, but perhaps in the problem statement, we take convergence as given? Wait, in the example provided, the assumptions were about the variable in the problem (n being integer and divisible by 7). Here, the variable n is the summation index, which is an integer starting from 0, so maybe the assumption is that the sum is over integers n ≥ 0. But the problem statement as given in the example didn't list \"n is an integer\" as an assumption for the summation variable, perhaps because it's implicit. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, and the formatted assumption listed \"n is an integer,\" even though in the problem statement it's already stated. Maybe in this case, the assumption would be that n is a non-negative integer, but since the sum is from n=0 to infinity, that's already part of the problem statement. Wait, looking at the user's example: the original problem said \"for every integer n,\" and the formatted assumption included \"n is an integer.\" So following that pattern, here, since the sum is over n starting from 0 to infinity, maybe the assumption is that n is a non-negative integer. However, the problem is not about a general n but about the sum over n. Hmm. Maybe the assumptions here are about the series: that it converges, but perhaps the user wants to list the conditions necessary for the equality to hold. Alternatively, maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond the series definition. Let me check the original problem again. The user's example included the divisibility by 7 as an assumption, but in the original problem, it wasn't stated; perhaps the user made a mistake, but maybe in the example, the original problem had an error. Wait, looking at the example: the original problem says \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7.\" That seems like the user added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, no, the original problem in the example was: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted assumption lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" But wait, that second assumption isn't in the original problem. That seems like a mistake. Maybe the example was incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended that sometimes assumptions need to be inferred. Wait, perhaps the example was a mistake, but the user provided it as an example. Wait, maybe in the example, the problem was originally \"Prove that for every integer n divisible by 7, A(n) is divisible by 91,\" and the user rephrased it. But the example's original problem says \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem includes \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems contradictory. Perhaps there was a mistake in the example. Therefore, maybe the user's example is not accurate, but regardless, we need to follow their instruction.\n\nIn the current problem, the question is to show the sum equals π/(3√3). The problem's main components are the series sum. The user's approach splits the fraction into partial fractions, leading to a telescoping series? But since it's an infinite sum, maybe they consider using known series expansions. The user mentions arctan(√3) = π/3, but the power series for arctan(x) converges only for |x| ≤ 1. Since √3 ≈ 1.732, which is outside the radius of convergence, so they can't directly use the series expansion. So maybe another approach is needed.\n\nBut back to structuring the problem. The problem as stated in the title is to show the sum equals π/(3√3). The user's question includes that they split into partial fractions and tried to use arctan, but faced convergence issues. So the assumptions here would be the conditions under which the series converges and perhaps the partial fraction decomposition is valid. The partial fraction decomposition 1/((3n+1)(3n+2)) = 1/(3n+1) - 1/(3n+2) is valid for all n except where denominators are zero, which isn't the case here. So maybe the assumptions are that the series is summed over n ≥ 0, and each term is decomposed into partial fractions. However, in the user's example, they listed assumptions about the variable n. So perhaps here, the assumption would be that n is a non-negative integer. But since the sum is from n=0 to infinity, that's already part of the problem statement. Alternatively, maybe there's an assumption about the convergence of the series. But the problem is to show the sum equals a certain value, which implies that the series converges. Therefore, maybe the assumption is that the series converges. However, in the user's example, they included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (n divisible by 7). Therefore, perhaps in this case, the key assumption is that the series converges, but perhaps the problem statement assumes that. Alternatively, maybe there are no additional assumptions beyond the series definition. Hmm.\n\nWait, the user's example took the original problem which was \"for every integer n\" and added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That suggests that perhaps the example had a mistake, but following that, perhaps the assistant is supposed to list all assumptions, even those not explicitly stated. But that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the original problem in the example was mistyped. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended that the assistant should extract implicit assumptions. However, in the current problem, the user's original question on Math Stack Exchange is to show the sum equals π/(3√3). The partial fraction decomposition is valid, and the series is from n=0 to infinity. The key assumptions here would be:\n\n1. The summation index n is a non-negative integer (i.e., n ∈ {0, 1, 2, ...}).\n2. The series converges (which may need to be proven, but the problem asks to show the sum equals the given value, implying convergence).\n\nBut in the user's example, they listed assumptions even if they were part of the problem statement. For example, \"n is an integer\" was part of the original problem's statement but was listed as an assumption. Therefore, following that pattern, here the assumptions would include that n is a non-negative integer. However, in the problem statement, the summation is from n=0 to infinity, so n is implicitly a non-negative integer. Therefore, perhaps the assumption should be listed as \"n is a non-negative integer.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no additional assumptions beyond what's in the problem statement. The example's original problem was \"for every integer n,\" and the formatted assumption listed \"n is an integer,\" which is redundant, but perhaps following that, here we list \"n is a non-negative integer.\"\n\nAnother possible assumption is that the series can be split into partial fractions as shown, but that's a step in the solution, not an assumption of the problem. The problem states that they have done the partial fraction decomposition, so that's part of their approach, not an assumption.\n\nTherefore, the key assumptions are:\n\n- The summation is over non-negative integers n (n = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n- The series converges (so that the sum equals the given value).\n\nBut in the user's example, they included assumptions about n (integer, divisible by 7) even though the problem stated \"for every integer n.\" So perhaps the formatting requires listing all conditions on the variables, even if they are part of the problem statement. Therefore, here, the assumption would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a non-negative integer,\nthe series converges.\n\nBut the problem is to show that the sum equals π/(3√3), which would require convergence. So perhaps the assumption is that the series converges. But the problem is to prove the equality, which includes proving convergence. Therefore, maybe the only assumption is that n is a non-negative integer, as the summation is over n starting at 0.\n\nAlternatively, the problem may have no explicit assumptions beyond the series definition. However, in the example, even though the problem stated \"for every integer n,\" the assumption listed \"n is an integer.\" So following that, here we list \"n is a non-negative integer\" as an assumption.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a non-negative integer,\nthe series ∑_{n=0}^∞ [1/((3n+1)(3n+2))] converges.\n\nProblem:\nShow that ∑_{n=0}^∞ [1/((3n+1)(3n+2))] = π/(3√3).\n\nBut the user's example didn't list convergence as an assumption; perhaps they considered it part of the problem. Alternatively, maybe in the current problem, the only assumption is that n is a non-negative integer, since the sum is over n starting from 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has no assumptions other than the series being defined as such. But following the example where the original problem's \"for every integer n\" was listed as an assumption, here the assumption would be \"n is a non-negative integer.\"\n\nThus, the final formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a non-negative integer.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $$ \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(3n+1)(3n+2)}=\\frac{\\pi}{3\\sqrt{3}}. $$\n\nBut the user's example included an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem, which might have been a mistake. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to list all variables' conditions as assumptions, even if they are part of the problem statement. Hence, here, since the sum is over n starting from 0, the assumption is n is a non-negative integer.\n\nAnother point: the original problem mentions using arctan, but since arctan's series converges only for |x| ≤1, but they want to use arctan(√3), which is outside that range. So maybe there's an assumption related to analytic continuation or another method, but that's part of the solution, not the problem's assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatted problem should have the assumption that n is a non-negative integer, and the problem is to show the sum equals π/(3√3).",
