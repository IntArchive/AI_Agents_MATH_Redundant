    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that the Assumptions should list each condition or property applied to one object, line by line. Then the Problem is restated concisely.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question. The title is \"Proving that the sequence $F_{n}(x)=\\sum\\limits_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{\\sin{kx}}{k}$ is boundedly convergent on $\\mathbb{R}$\". The question body repeats this and mentions it's an exercise in analysis.\n\nSo the task is to prove that the sequence {F_n(x)} is boundedly convergent on ℝ. Now, to list the assumptions. What are the conditions here?\n\nLooking at the problem statement: The sequence is defined by F_n(x) = sum_{k=1}^n (sin kx)/k. We need to prove boundedly convergent on ℝ. \n\nWhat does \"boundedly convergent\" mean? From analysis, I recall that bounded convergence might refer to uniform convergence on bounded subsets, or maybe convergence being bounded. But given the term \"boundedly convergent\" specifically, perhaps it means that the convergence is uniform on each bounded interval. However, the exact definition might be important here. Alternatively, it could mean that the sequence is both bounded and convergent pointwise, but given the context, it's more likely about uniform convergence on bounded subsets. However, the user's example included assumptions like \"n is divisible by 7\" which were part of the problem's given conditions. Here, the problem's assumptions would be the properties of F_n(x). But in the original problem, are there any explicit assumptions given, or are they implicit?\n\nIn the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So in that case, the user had to list those as assumptions. In the current problem, the user is just given the definition of F_n(x) and asked to prove it's boundedly convergent. Are there any hidden assumptions here? The sequence is defined for all real x, so the domain is ℝ. The functions F_n are partial sums of the series sum_{k=1}^∞ sin(kx)/k. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"boundedly convergent on ℝ\". So the assumptions would be the properties given in the problem statement. Since the problem is to prove that the sequence (as defined) is boundedly convergent, perhaps the only assumption is the definition of F_n(x). But in the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7, which were part of the problem's hypothesis. Here, maybe there are no additional assumptions except the structure of F_n(x). Wait, but the problem is to structure the problem by filtering unrelated info and listing assumptions. The original problem states that F_n(x) is the sum from k=1 to n of sin(kx)/k, and the task is to prove it's boundedly convergent on ℝ. \n\nSo in this case, the Assumption section should list each condition. The problem defines F_n(x) as that sum. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nFor each positive integer n, F_n(x) is defined as the sum from k=1 to n of (sin kx)/k,\nThe sequence {F_n(x)} is considered on the domain ℝ.\n\nBut the example had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n divisible by 7. Here, the problem doesn't state any conditions on x or n except that n is a positive integer (since it's a sum up to n). So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nF_n(x) = Σ_{k=1}^n (sin kx)/k,\nThe convergence is considered on the entire real line ℝ.\n\nBut the term \"boundedly convergent\" might have a specific meaning. Let me check. In some contexts, \"bounded convergence\" refers to the convergence occurring in a bounded manner, but in the context of sequences of functions, \"boundedly convergent\" could mean that the sequence is uniformly bounded and converges pointwise. Alternatively, it might mean that the convergence is uniform on bounded intervals. The problem might be using the term in a specific way. Since the user example included assumptions from the problem statement, here the problem statement is simply defining F_n and asking to prove boundedly convergent. So perhaps the key assumption is the definition of F_n(x). However, maybe the problem is expecting to note that each term (sin kx)/k is defined on ℝ, but that might be too trivial. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that x is real, which is given by \"on ℝ\". So, structuring:\n\nAssumption:\nFor each positive integer n, F_n(x) is defined as F_n(x) = Σ_{k=1}^n (sin(kx))/k,\nThe domain of consideration is ℝ.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about the variable n (being integer, divisible by 7). Here, n is a positive integer, which is part of the definition of the sequence. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nF_n(x) is defined as the sum from k=1 to n of sin(kx)/k,\nThe problem considers convergence on the entire set of real numbers ℝ.\n\nBut the problem says \"the sequence {F_n(x)} is boundedly convergent on ℝ\". So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n1. For each n ∈ ℕ, F_n: ℝ → ℝ is defined by F_n(x) = Σ_{k=1}^n sin(kx)/k.\n2. The convergence is considered on the entire real line ℝ.\n\nBut since the problem is to prove that the sequence is boundedly convergent, these are the given conditions. The example had two assumptions: n is integer and n divisible by 7, which were both part of the original problem's conditions. Here, the original problem doesn't state any conditions on x or n except those inherent in the definition. So the assumptions are the definition of F_n(x) and the domain ℝ. So in the Assumption section, list each of these.\n\nBut in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", so the first assumption was \"n is an integer\". Then there was an additional condition \"n is divisible by 7\". But in the current problem, the original problem states \"the sequence F_n(x)\" which implies n is a positive integer. So, similar to the example, the first assumption is \"n is a positive integer\" (since the sum is up to n). Then, the definition of F_n(x). Then, the domain is ℝ. But the problem statement mentions \"on ℝ\", so that's part of the problem's condition. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nF_n(x) is defined as Σ_{k=1}^n sin(kx)/k,\nThe problem considers the convergence on ℝ.\n\nBut perhaps the problem doesn't need to state that n is a positive integer because it's part of the definition of a sequence. However, in the example, they listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So following that example, here, the first assumption would be \"n is a positive integer\", then the definition of F_n, then the domain.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to take the sequence as defined for all positive integers n and real numbers x, and prove that it's boundedly convergent on ℝ. So the assumptions are:\n\n1. The sequence {F_n(x)} is defined by F_n(x) = Σ_{k=1}^n (sin(kx))/k for each positive integer n.\n2. The convergence is considered for all real numbers x.\n\nBut since the problem is on Math Stack Exchange, maybe the user had some hidden assumptions. Wait, the original problem's title is \"Proving that the sequence F_n(x) = sum_{k=1}^n sin(kx)/k is boundedly convergent on ℝ\". The question body is the same. So there are no more assumptions than the definition of F_n and the domain. So the Assumption section should list the definition of F_n and the domain. So:\n\nAssumption:\nFor each positive integer n, F_n(x) is defined as the sum from k=1 to n of sin(kx)/k,\nThe convergence is considered on the entire real line ℝ.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the sequence {F_n(x)} is boundedly convergent on ℝ.\n\nBut in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", and the formatted assumption was \"$n$ is an integer\", then \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". So here, in the current problem, the original problem says \"the sequence F_n(x)\" which inherently means n is a positive integer. So that's an assumption. Then the definition of F_n. Then the domain ℝ.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering n as any integer, but typically in sequences, n is a positive integer. So following the example's style, list \"n is a positive integer\" as an assumption. Then the definition of F_n. Then the domain ℝ. Hence:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nF_n(x) is defined as Σ_{k=1}^n (sin(kx))/k,\nThe sequence {F_n(x)} is considered on ℝ.\n\nProblem:\nProve that {F_n(x)} is boundedly convergent on ℝ.\n\nBut maybe \"considered on ℝ\" is redundant if the problem states \"on ℝ\". However, the example included both \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, the problem's only conditions are the definition of F_n and the domain. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nF_n(x) = Σ_{k=1}^n sin(kx)/k,\nx is a real number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the sequence {F_n(x)} is boundedly convergent on ℝ.\n\nBut since x is a real number is part of the domain, and the problem is about convergence on ℝ, which is stated in the problem. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nFor each positive integer n, F_n(x) = Σ_{k=1}^n sin(kx)/k,\nThe domain of x is ℝ.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the sequence {F_n(x)} is boundedly convergent on ℝ.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might require splitting into more atomic assumptions. For example, each part of the definition. But the example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate lines. Here, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nEach term of the sequence is F_n(x) = Σ_{k=1}^n sin(kx)/k,\nn ranges over positive integers,\nx is a real number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the sequence {F_n(x)} is boundedly convergent on ℝ.\n\nBut the example had two lines for n's properties, so here, maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nF_n(x) is defined as the sum from k=1 to n of sin(kx)/k,\nThe problem considers x in ℝ.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the sequence {F_n(x)} is boundedly convergent on ℝ.\n\nYes, this seems to align with the example's structure. Each assumption is a single property applied to one object. So n is a positive integer (applied to n), F_n(x) is defined as... (applied to F_n), and x is in ℝ (applied to x). Thus, three assumptions. Alternatively, maybe combining the definition of F_n and the domain into one, but the example split into two for n.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem says \"on ℝ\", that's part of the problem's condition, so perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nF_n(x) = Σ_{k=1}^n sin(kx)/k.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the sequence {F_n(x)} is boundedly convergent on ℝ.\n\nBut the example included \"n is divisible by 7\" as a separate assumption. So here, the problem's assumptions are n is a positive integer, the definition of F_n(x), and the domain is ℝ. So three assumptions. However, \"the domain is ℝ\" can be considered as part of the problem's setting. But since the problem states \"on ℝ\", maybe that's part of the problem statement rather than an assumption. However, the example included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. So perhaps in this problem, the assumptions are:\n\n1. n is a positive integer.\n2. F_n(x) is defined as Σ_{k=1}^n sin(kx)/k.\n3. The convergence is considered on the entire real line ℝ.\n\nHence, three assumptions, each on a separate line. The problem is to prove the sequence is boundedly convergent on ℝ.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nF_n(x) is defined as the sum from k=1 to n of sin(kx)/k,\nThe convergence is considered on the real line ℝ.\nProblem:\nProve that the sequence {F_n(x)} is boundedly convergent on ℝ.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third assumption is redundant since the problem already says \"on ℝ\". But following the example's approach, where the problem's original conditions were split into assumptions, including the domain. So yes, including \"The convergence is considered on ℝ\" as an assumption.\n\nBut in the example, the original problem was \"for every integer n\", and the formatted assumption was \"n is an integer\". Then there was another condition. Here, the original problem says \"the sequence F_n(x)\" which implies n is a positive integer (since sequences are typically indexed by positive integers). So \"n is a positive integer\" as the first assumption. Then the definition of F_n. Then the domain. So three assumptions. That seems consistent with the example.",
