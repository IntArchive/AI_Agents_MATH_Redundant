    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me start by reading the original question carefully. The user posted a problem on Math Stack Exchange titled \"How can prove that $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty }\\frac{\\zeta (2n)}{4^{n-1}}(1-\\frac{1}{4^n})=\\frac{\\pi }{2}$\". The question body repeats the series expression and mentions that WolframAlpha didn't recognize the closed-form as π/2, but when computing many terms, it approaches π/2. The user wants to prove this.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The example given in the problem had assumptions like \"n is an integer\", \"n is divisible by 7\". But here, the problem is about an infinite series involving the Riemann zeta function at even integers. Let me think about the components here.\n\nThe series is summing from n=1 to infinity of [ζ(2n)/4^{n-1} * (1 - 1/4^n)]. The zeta function at even integers is known to have a specific form involving Bernoulli numbers and powers of π. For example, ζ(2n) = (-1)^{n+1} B_{2n} (2π)^{2n} / (2(2n)!)). But maybe that's not directly an assumption here. The problem is to prove that this sum equals π/2.\n\nLooking for assumptions: The series starts at n=1, goes to infinity. The terms involve ζ(2n), which is the Riemann zeta function evaluated at even integers. The coefficients are 1/4^{n-1} multiplied by (1 - 1/4^n). Are there any conditions on convergence? For the zeta function, ζ(2n) converges for n ≥ 1 since 2n > 1. The terms 1/4^{n-1} and 1/4^{2n} (from 1 - 1/4^n) would decay exponentially, so the series should converge. But maybe the problem assumes convergence? Or maybe it's just given that the series is convergent. However, in the problem statement, there's no explicit condition given except that the sum equals π/2. The original question doesn't mention any specific conditions or restrictions, so perhaps the only assumption is about the structure of the series.\n\nWait, the problem is written as a sum from n=1 to infinity of [ζ(2n)/4^{n-1}*(1 - 1/4^n)]. Let me check if there's any hidden assumption here. The terms involve ζ(2n), which is defined for integers n ≥ 1. The expression 1 - 1/4^n is just a factor. So the main objects here are the zeta function at even integers, the exponents of 4, and the sum over n starting from 1 to infinity. Since the problem is to prove the sum equals π/2, perhaps the assumptions are implicit in the definition of the series components.\n\nIn the example given, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But in this current problem, the series is over n from 1 to infinity, so n is a positive integer. That's an assumption. Also, the zeta function is evaluated at 2n, which is valid for integers n ≥ 1. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n1. n is a positive integer.\n2. The series converges (though maybe that's part of the problem to check, but the user wants to prove the sum equals π/2, so perhaps convergence is assumed here).\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about the variable in the problem. Here, n is the summation index, so maybe the main assumption is about the series structure. Alternatively, perhaps there are no specific assumptions beyond the series being as defined. However, the problem is to prove the equality, so perhaps the only assumption is the definition of the series. Wait, but the example extracted specific conditions applied to one object. Let me check again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was about proving A(n) divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem listed assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem didn't specify n divisible by 7; the user probably made an error. Wait, no, looking back: the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, it's listed as assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should be n is an integer, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. But the example's formatted problem includes \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which was not in the original. That might be an error in the example, but perhaps it's a typo. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a different condition. Wait, maybe the original problem in the example was actually with n divisible by 7, but the user wrote \"for every integer n\". Hmm, maybe I need to be careful here.\n\nBut in the current problem, the series is over n starting at 1 to infinity. The main components are ζ(2n), which is defined for positive integers n. So the assumptions here would be that n is a positive integer (since the sum starts at n=1), and the series is as defined. However, the problem is to show that the sum equals π/2. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n- The series is summed from n=1 to infinity.\n- Each term in the series is ζ(2n)/(4^{n-1}) * (1 - 1/4^n).\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about the variable's properties. Here, n is the summation index, so maybe the key assumption is that the sum is over positive integers n. Alternatively, since the problem is to prove an equality, perhaps the assumptions are implicit in the definitions of the zeta function and the series.\n\nWait, the problem might also assume that the zeta function is defined in its standard way, which it is for Re(s) > 1, but here 2n is even integers, so ζ(2n) is defined. So maybe the key assumptions are:\n\n- For each positive integer n, ζ(2n) is the Riemann zeta function evaluated at 2n.\n- The series is summed from n=1 to infinity.\n- Each term is [ζ(2n)/4^{n-1}] * (1 - 1/4^n).\n\nBut perhaps the problem doesn't require more assumptions. The user didn't specify any additional conditions. So in the Assumption section, we list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nζ(2n) is the Riemann zeta function at even integers,\nthe series is summed from n=1 to infinity,\neach term of the series is [ζ(2n)/4^{n-1}]*(1 - 1/4^n).\n\nBut maybe some of these are redundant. For example, \"the series is summed from n=1 to infinity\" is part of the problem statement, but in the example, the assumption included \"n is an integer\". So perhaps here, the main assumption is that n is a positive integer (since the sum starts at n=1), and ζ(2n) is as defined. However, the problem statement itself is to prove that the sum equals π/2. So the formatted problem would list:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nζ(s) is the Riemann zeta function.\n\nBut maybe that's too broad. Alternatively, since ζ(2n) is specifically the zeta function at even integers, which has known expressions involving Bernoulli numbers and π^{2n}, perhaps that's part of the knowledge but not an assumption. The user is to prove the sum equals π/2, so the assumptions would be the components of the series.\n\nWait, the example had:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut that seems incorrect because the original says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which changes the problem. That might be a mistake in the example, but following that pattern, maybe in the current problem, the assumptions are the elements that are given. However, in the current problem, the user didn't state any conditions; it's just the series expression. So perhaps the only assumption is that n runs over positive integers, and ζ(2n) is the zeta function at even integers.\n\nBut the example's formatting seems to extract conditions from the problem. For instance, in the original problem, the user wrote \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is \"n is an integer\". Then, the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. But in the example provided by the user, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which wasn't in the original problem. That seems contradictory. Maybe there was a mistake in the example. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem had a different condition.\n\nIn any case, following the user's example, perhaps we need to extract explicit assumptions from the problem. In the current problem, the series is from n=1 to ∞, so n is a positive integer. That's one assumption. Each term involves ζ(2n), which is defined for 2n > 1, which is true for n ≥ 1. So another assumption could be that ζ(2n) is defined for each term. But that's inherent in the zeta function's definition. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes the convergence of the series, but since the user is asking to prove the sum equals π/2, convergence might be part of what needs to be proven, but perhaps it's assumed here.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to show the sum equals π/2, the main assumption is the expression of the series. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- The series is ∑_{n=1}^∞ [ζ(2n)/4^{n-1} (1 - 1/4^n)].\n\nBut that's restating the problem. The example's assumptions were about the variable's properties. Here, since n is the summation index, the key assumption is that n ranges over positive integers. So:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nthe series ∑_{n=1}^∞ [ζ(2n)/4^{n-1} (1 - 1/4^n)] is considered.\n\nBut the example had two assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. So following that structure, here the assumptions would be:\n\nn is a positive integer,\neach term of the series involves ζ(2n),\nthe series is summed from n=1 to infinity.\n\nBut perhaps more concisely, since the problem is to prove the sum equals π/2, the assumptions are the components of the series. However, to stick to the format where each assumption is a single property applied to one object, line by line.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nζ(2n) is the Riemann zeta function evaluated at 2n,\nthe series is ∑_{n=1}^∞ [ζ(2n)/4^{n-1} (1 - 1/4^n)].\n\nBut maybe the third point is part of the problem statement. The example had the problem statement as \"Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91\", where the expression was given. So in this case, the problem statement is the sum expression equals π/2, and the assumptions are about n and ζ(2n). So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nζ(2n) is the Riemann zeta function at 2n.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ∑_{n=1}^∞ [ζ(2n)/4^{n-1} (1 - 1/4^n)] = π/2.\n\nThat seems reasonable. Because the assumptions are that n is a positive integer (since the sum starts at 1 and increments by 1), and ζ(2n) refers to the zeta function at even integers. The problem is to prove the sum equals π/2.",
