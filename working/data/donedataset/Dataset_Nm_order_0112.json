    "Content": "The webpage Rounding Up To $\\pi$ defines a certain \"rounding up\" function by an extremely simple procedure: Beginning with any positive integer $n$ , round up to the nearest multiple of $n-1$ , then up to the nearest multiple of $n-2$ , and so on, up to the nearest multiple of $1$ . Let $f(n)$ denote the result. E.g., using an obvious notation, the sequence starting with $n=10$ is $$\n10 \\xrightarrow{9} 18 \\xrightarrow{8} 24 \\xrightarrow{7} 28 \\xrightarrow{6} 30 \\xrightarrow{5} 30 \\xrightarrow{4} 32 \\xrightarrow{3} 33 \\xrightarrow{2} 34 \\xrightarrow{1} 34 =:f(10).\n$$ The interesting thing is that, according to the webpage $^\\dagger$ , $(f(1),f(2),f(3),\\dots)$ is the same sequence that results from a certain sieving method, for which Erdős & Jabotinsky (1958) proved that $$\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{n^2}{f(n)} = \\pi,\n$$ so one naturally wonders what happens if, instead of rounding up to the nearest multiple, we round up to the second -nearest multiple, or the third -nearest, etc. Thus, let $f_k(n)$ denote the result of the \"rounding up\" sequence when using the $k^{\\mathrm{th}}$ -nearest multiple; e.g., using the second-nearest multiple, the sequence beginning with $10$ is $$\n10 \\xrightarrow{9} 27 \\xrightarrow{8} 40 \\xrightarrow{7} 49 \\xrightarrow{6} 60 \\xrightarrow{5} 65 \\xrightarrow{4} 72 \\xrightarrow{3} 75 \\xrightarrow{2} 78 \\xrightarrow{1} 79 =: f_2(10).\n$$ (These $f_k$ sequences occur in the OEIS under names like \"Generalized Tchoukaillon (or Mancala, or Kalahari) solitaire\" or related sieving processes, e.g. at the links $f_1$ , $f_2$ , $f_3$ , $f_4$ .) Now let $g_k(n):={n^2/f_k(n)}$ and, assuming all the limits exist, define the sequence $(G_k)_{k=1,2,3,\\dots}$ as $$\nG_k := \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} g_k(n) \n= \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{n^2}{f_k(n)}.\n$$ Here's a plot of $(g_k(10^6))_{k=1,\\dots,30}$ in which the $g_k$ have apparently converged in at least their first $5$ digits (numerically, it appears that generally the first $d$ digits of $g_k(10^{d+1})$ are those of the limit $G_k$ ): We know that $G_1=\\pi,$ and in the plot I've indicated my conjectured values for $G_2,G_3$ as well, based on a simple pattern that I found by searching numerically among the $g_k(n)$ ; specifically, I found that $g_{k+1}(n) \\approx \\frac{4}{k^2\\,g_k(n)}$ , with the absolute error bounded by $5/n$ , i.e., $$\n\\left|g_{k+1}(n) - \\frac{4}{k^2\\,g_k(n)}\\right| < \\frac{5}{n},\n\\quad k=1,2,3,\\dots\n$$ and also that $$\n\\left|g_{k}(n) - a_k\\right| < \\frac{5}{n},\n\\quad k=1,2,3,\\dots\n$$ with the $a_k$ defined recursively by $a_1=\\pi,\\; a_{k+1}=\\frac{4}{k^2\\,a_k},\\; k=1,2,3,\\dots$ This strongly suggests the following ... Conjecture : $$\n\\boxed{\\quad G_1 = \\pi, \n\\quad G_{k+1} = \\frac{4}{k^2\\,G_k}, \n\\quad k=1,2,3,\\dots \\quad}\\tag{1}\n$$ i.e., $$\n(G_k)_{k=1,2,3,\\ldots} = \\left(\\pi,\\, \\frac{4}{\\pi},\\, \\frac{\\pi}{4},\\, \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 \\frac{4}{\\pi},\\, \\left(\\frac{3}{4} \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 {\\pi},\\, \\left(\\frac{4}{5} \\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 \\frac{4}{\\pi},\\, \\left(\\frac{5}{6} \\frac{3}{4} \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 {\\pi},\\,\\ldots \\right).\n$$ Question : How to prove the recurrence relation in (1)?? NB : From the conjecture (1) it's straightforward to derive the following formulas that hold for all positive integers $k$ : $$G_k=\\begin{cases}\\left(\\prod_{j=1}^{k-1\\over 2}{2j-1\\over 2j}\\right)^2\\pi&\\text{if $k$ is odd}, \\\\\n\\left(\\prod_{j=1}^{k-2\\over 2}{2j\\over 2j+1}\\right)^2 {4\\over\\pi}&\\text{if $k$ is even}\\end{cases}\\\\ $$ $$G_k=\\left({(k-2)!!\\over(k-1)!!}\\right)^2\\cdot\n\\begin{cases}\n\\pi&\\text{if $k$ is odd},\\\\[3ex] \n{4\\over\\pi}&\\text{if $k$ is even}\\end{cases}\\\\ $$ $$G_k\\sim{2\\over k}$$ where the last line is from the known asymptotic behavior of double factorials . EDIT : As noted in a comment by Ash Malyshev, the conjectured $(G_k)_{k=1,2,3,\\dots}$ can also be written compactly as a ratio of squared gamma functions that I'll call $\\rho(k)$ : $$G_k = \\left({\\Gamma\\left({k\\over 2}\\right) \\over \\Gamma\\left({k+1\\over 2}\\right)}\\right)^2=:\\rho(k)$$ This can be established either by deriving it from the above formulas, or by showing that $\\rho(k)$ satisfies the defining recursion (1). I've updated the above plot to include the continuous function $\\rho$ (blue curve) on the real interval $(0, 30]$ :  The conjecture is that the blue dots ( $G_k$ ) coincide with this curve at every positive integer $k.$ $^\\dagger$ The \"rounding up\" function $f$ is actually implicit in the proof given by Erdős & Jabotinsky; see this answer by Misha Lavrov for more detail. For reference, here is the program I used for $f_k(n)$ : # Python\ndef f(k,n):   \n    y = n\n    for x in range(n-1,0,-1):  # i.e., for x = n-1, n-2, ..., 1\n        y = ((y-1)//x + k)*x   # i.e., y <- k-th multiple of x not less than y\n    return y Also, in view of the possible relevance of sieves for proving conjecture (1), here is a program implementing the following algorithm, which I claim generates the $f_k$ : Starting with seq $_1$ = $(1,2,3,\\dots)$ , let seq $_{i+1}$ be the result of deleting from seq $_i$ the first $k−1$ elements and then deleting every $(i+1)$ th element from those remaining. $f_k(n)$ will be the first element of seq $_n.$ def sieve(k, maxel):  # generates f_k(1), ..., f_k(n) <= maxel \n    seq = list(range(1, maxel+1))   # seq_1 = (1,2,3,...,maxel)\n    keep = seq[:1]    # keep the first element of seq_1\n    i = 1\n    while seq:        # while seq is not empty\n        del seq[:k-1]   # delete the first k-1 elements\n        del seq[::i+1]  # delete remaining elements with index divisible by i+1\n        keep += seq[:1] # keep the first element of seq_(i+1)\n        i += 1\n    return keep",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let me offer a direct adaptation of that of Rounding up to Pi . Fix $k\\geq 1$ , and apply the \"rounding up\" algorithm by selecting the $k$ -th nearest multiple, as you describe: this gives us an integer $S_{n,k}(x)$ for every integer $x$ between $1$ and $n$ , such that $S_{n,k}(1) = f_k(n)$ and $S_{n,k}(n) = n$ . Most of the trajectory is a sequence of parabola I start with the observation that the function $$ P_j(x) = (A_j - j x) x $$ coincides with $S_{n,k}$ for small values of $x$ when we choose $j=k$ and $A_k = kn+1$ . Rounding up to Pi went on to construct the $A_j$ so that for every $x$ , there was one $P_j$ such that $S_{n,1}(x) = P_j(x)$ . Keeping with that spirit, we can in fact prove a very similar claim: Claim 1: for every $n>k$ , there exists $k\\leq J,X\\leq n$ and three $\\mathbb{N}$ -valued sequences: $(j_x)_{X\\leq x \\leq n}$ with steps in $\\{0,-1\\}$ and $j_n = k$ , $(x_l)_{k-1 \\leq l \\leq J}$ decreasing with $x_{k-1} = n$ and $x_J = X-1$ , and $(A_l)_{k\\leq l \\leq J}$ increasing such that $$ \\forall k\\leq j \\leq J \\ , \\ \\forall x_j < x \\leq x_{j-1} \\ , \\quad S_{n,k}(x) = P_j(x) . \\qquad (0)$$ In other words, every $x$ with $X \\leq x \\leq n$ is \"on the parabola $P_{j_x}$ \" in the sense that $S_{n,k}(x) = P_{j_x}(x)$ , and the $x$ that are on the parabola $P_j$ are the integers in $(x_j, x_{j-1}]$ . proof. We start with the following observation: for every $ux < y \\leq ux+x$ with $u,x,y$ integers, rounding up $y$ to the $k$ -th nearest multiple of $x$ gives $(u+k)x$ . We will prove $(0)$ together with the property $$ \\forall k\\leq j \\leq J \\ , \\ \\forall x_j \\leq x < x_{j-1} \\ , \\quad x(j-k) < A_j - j(x+1) \\leq x(j-k+1) . \\qquad (0’)$$ We have $(0)$ and $(0)’$ for $x=n$ .\nLet us now proceed by induction. Assume that for some $0< x \\leq n$ , we have constructed $(j_z)_{x\\leq z \\leq n}$ , $(x_l)_{k\\leq l \\leq j_x}$ and $(A_l)_{k\\leq l \\leq j_x}$ so that $(0)$ and $(0’)$ hold when (only there!) pretending that $x_{j_x-1} = x-1$ . Write $j=j_x$ . We know that $S_{n,k}(x) = P_j(x) = x (A_j - jx) = (x-1)(A_j-jx) + (A_j-jx)$ . We want to round $S_{n,k}(x)$ up to the $k$ -th closest multiple of $x-1$ . Observe that $A_j-jx > (x-1)(j-k)$ either from $(0’)$ (if $x<n$ ) or a direct computation (if $x=n$ ). There are three cases, depending on the value of $A_j - jx$ as it appears in $(0’)$ : First case, $(x-1)(j-k) < A_j - jx \\leq (x-1)(j-k+1)$ : then $$ (x-1)(A_j - jx + j - k) < S_{n,k}(x) \\leq (x-1)(A_j - jx + j - k + 1) , $$ so by the observation $S_{n,k}(x-1) = (x-1)(A_j - j(x-1)) = P_{j}(x-1)$ . This proves $(0)$ and $(0’)$ for $x-1$ , by setting $j_{x-1} = j$ . Second case, $(x-1)(j-k+1) < A_j - jx \\leq (x-1)(j-k+2)$ : then set $j_{x-1} = j+1$ , $x_j = x-1$ , and observe that similarly $$ S_{n,k}(x-1) = (x-1)(A_j - j(x-1) + 1) = (x-1)(A_{j+1} - (j+1)(x-1)) $$ when we choose $A_{j+1} = A_j + x = A_j + x_j + 1$ . Third case, $A_j - jx > (x-1)(j-k+2)$ : then set $J = j$ , $X=x$ , $x_j = x-1$ and stop. Note that by $(0’)$ this can happens only if $j\\geq x$ . $\\square$ Note: We can in fact guess that $J \\approx \\mathrm{cste} \\, n^{2/3}$ , as I did in a previous version, by using the approximation $X \\approx A_J / 2J$ , $A_J \\approx n b_J$ and $X \\approx J$ . Computing the parameters of the parabola We already established in the proof that $$ A_k = kn+1 \\quad , \\quad A_{j+1} = A_j + x_j + 1 . $$ What is the value of $x_j$ for $k\\leq j < J$ ? By $(0’)$ we must have $$\\begin{cases}\nA_j-j(x_j+2) \\leq (x_j+1)(j-k+1) &\\iff A_j - j + k - 1 \\leq (2j-k+1)x_j , \\\\\nA_j-j(x_j+1) > x_j(j-k+1) &\\iff A_j - j > (2j-k+1)x_j .\n\\end{cases}$$ This implies $$ \\left| x_j - \\frac{A_j}{2j-k+1} \\right| < 1 . $$ It is tedious to get exact values, so we will work with approximations instead. Define $$ B_k = A_k = kn+1 \\quad , \\quad \\forall j\\geq k \\ , \\ B_{j+1} = B_j + \\frac{B_j}{2j-k+1} = B_j \\frac{2j-k+2}{2j-k+1} . $$ We can check that $|B_j - A_j|$ is bounded for every $j$ by something independent of $n$ . On the other hand, $B_j / n \\to b_j > 0$ as $n\\to\\infty$ with \\begin{align} \nb_{j} &= k \\prod_{l=k}^{j-1} \\frac{2l-k+2}{2l-k+1} =  k \\prod_{l=k+1}^{j} \\frac{2l-k}{2l-k-1} \\\\\n&= k \\frac{\\left(1+\\frac k 2\\right)^{(j-k)}}{\\left(\\frac{k+1}2\\right)^{(j-k)}} = k \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(1+\\frac k 2+(j-k)\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(1+\\frac k 2\\right)} \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{k+1}2\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{k+1}2 + j-k\\right)}\n\\end{align} so $A_j / n \\to b_j$ as $n\\to\\infty$ as well. Using that $\\frac{\\Gamma(x+1)}{\\sqrt{x}\\Gamma(x+1/2)} \\to 1$ as $x\\to\\infty$ we find that $$ \\frac{b_j}{\\sqrt{j}} \\underset{j\\to\\infty}\\longrightarrow k \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{k+1}2\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(1+\\frac k 2\\right)} = 2\\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{k+1}2\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac k 2\\right)}, $$ so that as $j\\to\\infty$ $$ \\frac{4 j}{b_j^2} \\to G_k. $$ Claim 2: the sequence $(b_j / \\sqrt{j})_{j\\geq k}$ is monotone increasing. This is a consequence of the log-convexity of the Gamma function . The final value The heuristic used in Rounding up to Pi is $$ f_k(n) := S_{n,k}(1) = \\sup_{k\\leq l\\leq j} \\sup_{1\\leq x \\leq n} P_l(x) . \\qquad (*) $$ Let us get a precise version: since $S_{n,k}$ is decreasing and $S_{n,k}(x-1) \\leq S_{n,k}(x) + k(x-1)$ , we have for every $1\\leq x \\leq n$ $$ S_{n,k}(x) \\leq f_k(n) \\leq S_{n,k}(x) + k\\frac{x(x-1)}{2} . $$ We have constructed the sequences of Claim 1 for at least all $j\\leq J$ , where $J = j_X$ and $X$ is the largest integer such that $j_X \\geq X$ . Since $j_X \\leq k + (n-X)$ we must have $J\\geq c \\sqrt{n}$ for some $c>0$ , implying $J\\to \\infty$ as $n\\to\\infty$ . We can find functions $r_1, r_2, \\dots$ such that for every $j < J$ , $$|A_j - n b_j| \\leq r_1(j) \\quad , \\quad \\left| x_j - \\frac{n b_j}{2j-k+1} \\right| \\leq r_2(j) \\ , $$ which implies (recalling $S_{n,k}(x_j+1) = P_j(x_j+1)$ ) $$ \\left| S_{n,k}(x_j+1) - n^2 b_j^2 \\frac{j-k+1}{(2j-k+1)^2} \\right| \\leq n r_3(j) . $$ Take now any $j$ fixed and arbitrarily large; because $J\\to\\infty$ as $n\\to\\infty$ we will have $j<J$ for every $n$ large enough, and the above inequalities will be verified.\nThis gives us, first that $$ \\liminf_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{f_n(k)}{n^2} \\geq \\liminf_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{S_{n,k}(x_j+1)}{n^2} \\geq b_j^2 \\frac{j-k+1}{(2j-k+1)^2} $$ where the right-hand side is larger than $G_k^{-1}-\\epsilon$ for every $j$ large enough; then that \\begin{align}\n\\limsup_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{f_n(k)}{n^2} \\leq \\limsup_{n\\to\\infty} \\left(\\frac{S_{n,k}(x_j+1)}{n^2} + k\\frac{x_j(x_j-1)}{2n^2}\\right) \\leq b_j^2 \\left( \\frac{j-\\frac{1}{2}k+1}{(2j-k+1)^2} \\right) \n\\end{align} which by the same reasoning is smaller than $G_k^{-1} + \\epsilon$ for every $j$ large enough. This concludes the proof of the convergence $$ \\frac{n^2}{f_k(n)} \\underset{n\\to\\infty}\\longrightarrow G_k , $$ with $G_k$ given by your formulas. Edits Edit 1: Some mistakes have slipped in my final computations. I rewrote $b_j$ using Pochhammer symbols and Gamma functions, which makes computation easier afterwards. Edit 2: Added a proof of the heuristic (*). Edit 3: Major rewrite, with division into sections. I have tried to made things less informal: many back-of-the-envelope calculations are now almost-rigorous, at the cost of the technical Claim 1. Edit 4: Added a proof of Claim 2. Edit 5: Corrected the final proof of the convergence of $f_k(n)$ by bounding the difference between $f_k(n)$ and $S_{n,k}(x_j+1)$ for any fixed $j$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem and structure it according to the required format. The user wants me to act as a math professor, read the Math Stack Exchange question, filter out the unrelated information, and present the problem in the specified format with assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the original question. The user is talking about a function f_k(n) defined through a rounding-up process. The main goal is to prove a conjectured recurrence relation for the limits G_k, where G_k is the limit as n approaches infinity of n squared divided by f_k(n). The conjecture is that G_1 = π, and G_{k+1} = 4/(k² G_k). \n\nThe example provided by the user shows that assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. So, looking at the problem, the key assumptions here are:\n\n1. The function f_k(n) is defined by rounding up to the k-th nearest multiple in the described procedure.\n2. The limit G_k exists for all positive integers k.\n3. The recurrence relation is conjectured based on numerical evidence and patterns observed in the sequence.\n\nBut the problem is asking to prove this recurrence relation. The original question includes a lot of background information about how f_k(n) is computed, examples with sequences, references to OEIS, the sieving process, and even Python code. However, for the assumptions, I need to extract only the essential conditions and properties that are directly related to the conjecture to be proven.\n\nLooking at the conjecture box: It states G_1 = π and G_{k+1} = 4/(k² G_k) for k ≥ 1. The assumptions needed here would be the definitions of G_k as the limit of n² / f_k(n), the existence of these limits, and perhaps the initial condition G_1 = π. However, in the example given by the user, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is about the recurrence relation for G_k, so the assumptions would be the definitions and existence of the limits.\n\nWait, the user's example included assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7, which are specific conditions. In this problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- For each positive integer k, the limit G_k = lim_{n→∞} n² / f_k(n) exists.\n- G_1 is equal to π (as proven by Erdős & Jabotinsky).\n- The recurrence relation G_{k+1} = 4/(k² G_k) holds for all positive integers k.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to prove the recurrence relation, so the assumptions are the conditions given that lead to the conjecture. The conjecture is based on numerical evidence and the observed recursive pattern. So the actual assumptions here would be the definitions of f_k(n) via the rounding-up process, the existence of the limits G_k, and perhaps the initial condition G_1 = π (since that is established by prior work). However, the problem is to prove the recurrence, so the existence of the limits might be part of what needs to be established, but the user states \"assuming all the limits exist,\" so the problem is under that assumption.\n\nThe original problem states: \"assuming all the limits exist, define the sequence (G_k) as G_k = lim_{n→∞} g_k(n) = lim_{n→∞} n² / f_k(n). Here's a plot... the conjecture is that G_1 = π, G_{k+1} = 4/(k² G_k). Question: How to prove the recurrence relation in (1)?\"\n\nTherefore, the key assumptions here are:\n\n- For each positive integer k, the limit G_k = lim_{n→∞} n² / f_k(n) exists.\n- The function f_k(n) is defined by the described rounding-up process (k-th nearest multiple).\n- The initial term G_1 = π is known from prior results (Erdős & Jabotinsky).\n\nBut since the problem is to prove the recurrence relation given that the limits exist, perhaps the main assumption is that all G_k exist. The definition of f_k(n) via the rounding process is a given condition. The initial condition G_1 = π is a premise here.\n\nSo structuring the assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\nFor each positive integer k, the limit G_k = lim_{n→∞} (n² / f_k(n)) exists.\nf_k(n) is defined by the rounding-up process to the k-th nearest multiple.\nG_1 = π.\n\nBut the formatting requires each assumption to be a single line addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So breaking down:\n\nAssumption:\n- For each positive integer k, the limit G_k = lim_{n→∞} (n² / f_k(n)) exists.\n- f_k(n) is the result of rounding up to the k-th nearest multiple in the described iterative process.\n- G_1 = π.\n\nBut the problem is to prove the recurrence relation G_{k+1} = 4/(k² G_k) for k ≥ 1. The initial term G_1 = π is already established, so that's an assumption. The existence of the limits for all k is also an assumption here because the problem states \"assuming all the limits exist.\"\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have these assumptions and then the problem statement. Let me check the example again. In the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the key assumptions are the existence of the limits, the definition of f_k(n), and G_1 = π.\n\nBut the problem is about proving the recurrence relation given these assumptions. Therefore, the problem statement would be: Prove that the sequence (G_k) satisfies the recurrence relation G_{k+1} = 4/(k² G_k) for all positive integers k, given that G_1 = π and the limits exist.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nFor each positive integer k, the limit G_k = lim_{n→∞} (n² / f_k(n)) exists.\nf_k(n) is defined by rounding up to the k-th nearest multiple in the iterative process.\nG_1 = π.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the sequence (G_k) satisfies G_{k+1} = (4)/(k² G_k) for all positive integers k.\n\nWait, but the original conjecture includes both G_1 = π and the recurrence. However, in the problem statement, the user wrote \"assuming all the limits exist\" and the conjecture is the recurrence. The problem is to prove the recurrence given that the limits exist and G_1 is known. So the initial value G_1 = π is part of the conjecture, but in the assumptions, we need to state that G_1 = π is given.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to prove the recurrence, given that G_1 = π and assuming the limits exist. Therefore, the assumptions should list the existence of G_k for all k, the definition of f_k(n), and that G_1 is π.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nFor each positive integer k, the limit G_k = lim_{n→∞} (n² / f_k(n)) exists.\nThe function f_k(n) is obtained by rounding up to the k-th nearest multiple in each step of the iterative process.\nG_1 = π.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the sequence (G_k) satisfies the recurrence relation G_{k+1} = 4/(k² G_k) for all positive integers k.\n\nThis seems to capture the necessary assumptions and the problem. The iterative process is part of the definition of f_k(n), which is needed to define G_k. The existence of the limits is assumed, and G_1 is given as π. The problem is to show the recurrence relation holds.\n\nI think this should be the correct structure. Let me verify once more. The original problem states that the conjecture is the recurrence, and the question is how to prove it. The assumptions needed are the existence of the limits, the definition of f_k via the rounding process, and the base case G_1 = π. Therefore, the formatted problem should include these three assumptions and the problem to prove the recurrence.",
