    "Content": "Found this lovely identity the other day, and thought it was fun enough to share as a problem: If $a+b+c=0$ then show $$\\frac{a^3+b^3+c^3}{3}\\frac{a^7+b^7+c^7}{7} = \\left(\\frac{a^5+b^5+c^5}{5}\\right)^2.$$ There are, of course, brute force techniques for showing this, but I'm hoping for something elegant.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $T_{m}$ be $a^m+b^m+c^m$. Let $k=-ab-bc-ca$, and $l=abc$. Note that this implies $a,b,c$ are solutions to $x^3=kx+l$. Using Newton's Identity , note the fact that $T_{m+3}=kT_{m+1}+lT_{m}$(which can be proved by summing $x^3+kx+l$) It is not to difficult to see that $T_{2}=2k$, $T_3=3l$, from $a+b+c=0$. From here, note that $T_{4}=2k^2$ using the identity above. In the same method, note that $T_{5}=5kl$. From here, note $T_{7}=5k^2l+2k^2l=7k^2l$ from $T_{m+3}=kT_{m+1}+lT_{m}$ . Therefore, the equation simplifies to showing that $k^2l \\times l=(kl)^2$, which is true.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's take a look at this problem. The user wants me to structure the given mathematics question according to the specified format. The original problem is about proving an identity involving variables a, b, c under the condition that a + b + c = 0. The user provided an example where assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original problem from the Math Stack Exchange question. The problem states: If a + b + c = 0, then show that the product of (a³ + b³ + c³)/3 and (a⁷ + b⁷ + c⁷)/7 equals the square of (a⁵ + b⁵ + c⁵)/5. \n\nThe main assumption here is that a, b, c are such that their sum is zero. The example given in the user's instruction had two assumptions, but in this case, the problem only mentions one condition: a + b + c = 0. However, I need to check if there are any implicit assumptions. The problem doesn't specify whether a, b, c are real numbers, complex numbers, etc. But in algebraic identities like this, unless specified, it's usually assumed they are elements of a field (like real or complex numbers), but since the problem doesn't mention any restrictions, maybe we just list the given condition. \n\nWait, the example in the user's instruction had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in the problem here, the only explicit condition is a + b + c = 0. The problem asks to show an equality, so maybe all other variables are just elements in some commutative ring where division by 3, 5, 7 is allowed (so characteristic not 3, 5, 7). But the user's example didn't mention that. For instance, in the example, the assumption was n is an integer and divisible by 7. The problem here only gives a + b + c = 0. \n\nTherefore, the only explicit assumption is that a + b + c = 0. The user's example listed each assumption line by line. So even if there's only one assumption, we list it. But wait, in the example, two assumptions were listed: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. However, the original problem in the example only mentions \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, the original example's problem was:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nBut in the formatted problem, the assumptions were \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like a mistake. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example had a typo or misunderstanding. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the user's example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1 ) - 6^n (3^n + 2^n ) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: \nn is an integer,\nn is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nBut the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. Unless perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. Because if n is any integer, then n doesn't need to be divisible by 7. But 91 is 7*13, so perhaps the problem requires n to be divisible by both 7 and 13? Or maybe the original problem had a condition that n is divisible by 7? Wait, maybe the original problem was actually \"for every integer n divisible by 7\", but the user wrote \"for every integer n\". Then the example is wrong. But I need to proceed with the current problem.\n\nIn any case, the user's example shows that assumptions are listed line by line. So in the current problem, the main assumption is a + b + c = 0. The problem doesn't specify any other constraints on a, b, c. So in the Assumption section, we should list \"a + b + c = 0\". Each assumption is one line. Since there's only one condition, that's the only assumption.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\na + b + c = 0\n\nProblem:\nProve that (a³ + b³ + c³)/3 * (a⁷ + b⁷ + c⁷)/7 = [(a⁵ + b⁵ + c⁵)/5]^2\n\nBut I need to check if there are any other implicit assumptions. For example, if a, b, c are real numbers, but the problem doesn't specify. Since the example didn't include such implicit assumptions, maybe we just stick to the given condition. Hence, only one assumption here.",
