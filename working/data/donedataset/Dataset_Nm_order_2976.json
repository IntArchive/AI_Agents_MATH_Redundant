    "Content": "So I'm doing a review test and I have this problem: Prove in full detail, with the standard operations in $\\Bbb R^2$ , that the set $\\{(x,2x): x \\ \\text{is a real number}\\}$ is a vector space. Attempt: Given: $(x_1, 2x_1) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ and $(x_2, 2x_2) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ Addition: $(x_1, 2x_1) + (x_2, 2x_2) = (x_1 + x_2, 2x_1 + 2x_2) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ $ = (x_1 + x_2, 2(x_1 + x_2)) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ $ ≃ (x, 2x) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ Thus the set is closed under addition Scalar multiplication: $c(x_1, 2x_1) = (cx_1, 2(cx_1)) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ $ ≃ (x, 2x) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ Thus the set is closed under scalar multiplication Are these operations enough to prove that the set is a vector space? Or do I have to go through each of the following (or in other words do I have to to the same thing for each property in the definition):",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Write\n$$V=\\{(x,2x)\\mid x\\in\\mathbf{R}\\}.$$ Here the main thing is to note that $(x_1,2x_1)+(x_2,2x_2)$ and $c(x_1,2x_1)$ [edit]a bad typo was here - it used to read c(x_1,2x_2) [/edit] can both be written in the form $(y,2y)$ for some $y\\in\\mathbf{R}$, in other words that they are elements of $V$. You have not shown that $V$ is closed under addition and scalar multiplication unless you do that. As Vhailor pointed out, once you do this, you get the vector space axioms for free, because the set $V$ inherits them from $\\mathbf{R}^2$, which is (hopefully) already known to you to be a vector space with respect to these very operations. So, to fix your proof, show that 1) $(x_1,2x_1)+(x_2,2x_2)\\in V$ for all $x_1,x_2\\in\\mathbf{R}$. 2) $c(x,2x)\\in V$ for all $x\\in\\mathbf{R}$. Look up subspace criteria or something like that.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. The task is to list all assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object, and then state the problem clearly.\n\nFirst, the original question is about proving that the set {(x, 2x) | x ∈ ℝ} is a vector space under the standard operations in ℝ². The user's attempt shows they checked closure under addition and scalar multiplication but are unsure if they need to verify all vector space axioms.\n\nNow, to structure this properly:\n\nAssumptions: Need to list all conditions inherent to the problem. The set in question is a subset of ℝ², specifically all vectors of the form (x, 2x). The operations are the standard ones in ℝ² (addition and scalar multiplication as defined in the parent space). The problem is to verify if this subset with these operations satisfies all vector space axioms.\n\nEach assumption should be a single line. So, first, the set is defined as all ordered pairs (x, 2x) where x is a real number. Then, the operations are the standard addition and scalar multiplication of ℝ². These are separate assumptions. Additionally, the problem implies that we need to check all vector space axioms, even though the user only checked closure. So perhaps another assumption is that the operations must satisfy all vector space properties, not just closure.\n\nWait, but maybe the key assumptions here are about the structure given. Let's see:\n\n- The set is S = {(x, 2x) | x ∈ ℝ}\n- The operations on S are the standard operations of ℝ² (i.e., component-wise addition and scalar multiplication)\n- The task is to prove S is a vector space under these operations.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption is a specific condition applied to one object. So breaking it down:\n\nAssumption 1: The set in question is S = {(x, 2x) | x is a real number}.\n\nAssumption 2: The operations on S are the standard addition and scalar multiplication defined in ℝ².\n\nBut maybe the example includes more. Wait, in the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- S is a subset of ℝ².\n\n- S consists of all vectors of the form (x, 2x) where x is a real number.\n\n- The operations on S are the standard addition and scalar multiplication of ℝ².\n\nBut each assumption should be one line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe set is S = {(x, 2x) | x is a real number},\n\nS is equipped with the standard addition operation of ℝ²,\n\nS is equipped with the standard scalar multiplication operation of ℝ².\n\nProblem: Prove in full detail that S is a vector space.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's key is that the user is to verify S is a vector subspace of ℝ², which would only require checking closure and the existence of the zero vector, etc., but the original question says \"prove in full detail that the set is a vector space,\" which might mean they have to check all axioms unless they can cite a subspace criterion. But the problem as stated doesn't mention subspaces, so the user is supposed to check all axioms.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are about the set and the operations. So the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe set is defined as S = {(x, 2x) | x is a real number},\n\nThe addition operation on S is defined as component-wise addition in ℝ²,\n\nThe scalar multiplication operation on S is defined as component-wise scalar multiplication in ℝ².\n\nProblem: Prove in full detail that S is a vector space.\n\nWait, but in the example, assumptions included both the variable's domain (n is integer) and a condition (n divisible by 7). Here, the assumptions are about the set's structure and the operations. So each operation is a separate assumption. Thus, each line should state one condition.\n\nYes, so each line should be a single condition. So:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe set S consists of all ordered pairs (x, 2x) where x is a real number,\n\nThe addition operation on S is the standard addition in ℝ²,\n\nThe scalar multiplication operation on S is the standard scalar multiplication in ℝ².\n\nProblem: Prove in full detail that S is a vector space.\n\nThis seems correct. Each line addresses one property: the set's definition, the addition operation, and the scalar multiplication. Each is applied to the set S. The problem is to prove S is a vector space under these operations.\n\nThe user in the original question might have thought closure is enough, but since the problem says \"prove in full detail,\" it requires verifying all vector space axioms, so the answer needs to structure the problem accordingly.",
