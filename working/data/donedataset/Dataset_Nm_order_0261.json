    "Content": "Let $A$ be a block upper triangular matrix: $$A = \\begin{pmatrix} A_{1,1}&A_{1,2}\\\\ 0&A_{2,2} \\end{pmatrix}$$ where $A_{1,1} ∈ C^{p \\times p}$ , $A_{2,2} ∈ C^{(n-p) \\times (n-p)}$ . Show that the eigenvalues of $A$ are the combined eigenvalues of $A_{1,1}$ and $A_{2,2}$ I've been pretty much stuck looking at this for a good hour and a half, so any help would be much appreciated.

    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $A$ be the original matrix of size $n \\times n$. One way out is to use the identity. (Result from Schur Complement) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schur_complement $\\det \\left( \\begin{matrix} B_{1,1}&B_{1,2}\\\\ B_{2,1 }&B_{2,2} \\end{matrix} \\right) = \\det(B_{1,1}) \\times \\det(B_{22} - B_{21}B_{11}^{-1}B_{12})$. We know that $\\lambda$ is a number such that $Ax = \\lambda x$. From which we get $\\det(A-\\lambda I_n) = 0$. In your case, the matrix $A_{21}$ is a zero matrix and hence, we get $\\det(A-\\lambda I_n) = \\det \\left( \\left( \\begin{matrix} A_{1,1}&A_{1,2}\\\\ 0&A_{2,2} \\end{matrix}\\right) - \\lambda I_n \\right) = \\det \\left( \\begin{matrix} A_{1,1} - \\lambda I_{k}&A_{1,2}\\\\ 0&A_{2,2} - \\lambda I_{n-k} \\end{matrix}\\right)$ Hence $\\det(A-\\lambda I_n) = \\det(A_{1,1} - \\lambda I_{k}) \\times \\det(A_{22} - \\lambda I_{n-k})$. So we get that if $\\lambda$ is an eigen value of $A_{11}$ or $A_{22}$, then either $\\det(A_{11}-\\lambda I_k) = 0$ or $\\det(A_{22}-\\lambda I_{n-k}) = 0$ and hence $\\det(A-\\lambda I_n) = 0$ and hence $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $A$. Similarly, if $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $A$, then $\\det(A-\\lambda I_n) = 0$, then either $\\det(A_{11}-\\lambda I_k) = 0$ or $\\det(A_{22}-\\lambda I_{n-k}) = 0$ and hence $\\lambda$ is an eigen value of $A_{11}$ or $A_{22}$. Edit There is actually a small error in the above argument. You might wonder that if $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $A_{11}$, then $A_{11} - \\lambda I_k$ is not invertible and hence the identity $\\det \\left( \\begin{matrix} B_{1,1}&B_{1,2}\\\\ B_{2,1 }&B_{2,2} \\end{matrix} \\right) = \\det(B_{1,1}) \\times \\det(B_{22} - B_{21}B_{11}^{-1}B_{12})$ is false since $B_{11}$ is not invertible. However, there is an another identity $\\det \\left( \\begin{matrix} B_{1,1}&B_{1,2}\\\\ 0&B_{2,2} \\end{matrix} \\right) = \\det(B_{1,1}) \\times \\det(B_{22})$ which is always true. (Prove both the identites as an exercise). We can make use of this identity to get\n $\\det(A-\\lambda I_n) = \\det(A_{1,1} - \\lambda I_{k}) \\times \\det(A_{22} - \\lambda I_{n-k})$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem properly. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the given question according to the specified example. \n\nFirst, the original question is about proving that the eigenvalues of a block upper triangular matrix are the combined eigenvalues of its diagonal blocks. The matrix given is a 2x2 block matrix with A₁₁ and A₂₂ on the diagonal, and A₁₂ in the upper right block, and zero below. \n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions should list each condition line by line, each addressing one property of a single object. Let me parse the problem statement again. \n\nThe matrix A is block upper triangular. The blocks A₁₁ and A₂₂ are square matrices of sizes p×p and (n-p)×(n-p), respectively. The key assumptions here are about the structure of the matrix and the dimensions of the blocks.\n\nSo breaking it down:\n\n1. The matrix A is block upper triangular. That's one condition on A's structure.\n2. A₁₁ is a complex matrix of size p×p. Specifies the type and size of A₁₁.\n3. A₂₂ is a complex matrix of size (n-p)×(n-p). Similarly for A₂₂.\n4. The zero block in the lower left is part of the structure, but maybe that's implied by being block upper triangular. However, the problem statement explicitly mentions \"block upper triangular matrix\" so maybe the zero block is covered under that assumption. But in the example, assumptions were listed for each object. Wait, in the example, the original problem mentioned that n is an integer and n divisible by 7. Here, the problem states the structure of A, the types of the blocks. So perhaps:\n\nAssumptions:\n- A is a block upper triangular matrix with structure as given.\n- A₁₁ is a complex p×p matrix.\n- A₂₂ is a complex (n-p)×(n-p) matrix.\n\nWait, but maybe each assumption should be one line per property. For example, each block's dimension and the structure of the matrix. So:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a block upper triangular matrix of the form [[A₁₁, A₁₂], [0, A₂₂]],\nA₁₁ is a square matrix with dimensions p×p,\nA₁₂ is a matrix with dimensions p×(n-p),\nA₂₂ is a square matrix with dimensions (n-p)×(n-p),\nAll matrices are over the complex numbers.\n\nWait, but the original problem states \"A_{1,1} ∈ C^{p×p}\", so the entries are complex. So perhaps:\n\nAssumptions:\n- A is a block matrix of the form [[A₁₁, A₁₂], [0, A₂₂]],\n- A₁₁ ∈ C^{p×p},\n- A₂₂ ∈ C^{(n-p)×(n-p)}.\n\nThe problem is to show that the eigenvalues of A are the combined eigenvalues of A₁₁ and A₂₂.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were listed as separate lines. So each bullet point is a separate assumption. So here, the first assumption is the structure of A (block upper triangular), then the second and third assumptions are the sizes of the diagonal blocks. The fact that they are complex matrices is part of their definitions (as given in the problem statement). So yes, the problem mentions \"A_{1,1} ∈ C^{p×p}\", so that's an assumption.\n\nSo structured as:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a block upper triangular matrix with the given block structure,\nA₁₁ is an element of C^{p×p},\nA₂₂ is an element of C^{(n-p)×(n-p)}.\n\nProblem: Show that the eigenvalues of A are the combined eigenvalues of A₁₁ and A₂₂.\n\nWait, but the example had in the original problem that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, which were two separate assumptions. Here, maybe the structure of the matrix is one assumption, and the sizes of the blocks are separate? Or perhaps each block's size is a separate assumption. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the user wrote:\n\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\n\nSo each assumption is a separate line. So here, the problem's assumptions would be:\n\n- A is a block upper triangular matrix as specified (i.e., [[A₁₁, A₁₂]; [0, A₂₂]]),\n- A₁₁ is a p×p complex matrix,\n- A₂₂ is an (n-p)×(n-p) complex matrix.\n\nBut the original problem statement mentions that A is block upper triangular with those blocks, and the blocks are of those sizes. So each of those is an assumption.\n\nSo the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a block upper triangular matrix of the form [[A₁₁, A₁₂]; [0, A₂₂]],\nA₁₁ is an element of C^{p×p},\nA₂₂ is an element of C^{(n-p)×(n-p)}.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the eigenvalues of A are the combined eigenvalues of A₁₁ and A₂₂.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the structure is one assumption, and the blocks' dimensions are two separate ones. Let me see the original question again. The user wrote:\n\n\"Let A be a block upper triangular matrix: $$A = \\begin{pmatrix} A_{1,1}&A_{1,2}\\\\ 0&A_{2,2} \\end{pmatrix}$$ where $A_{1,1} ∈ C^{p \\times p}$ , $A_{2,2} ∈ C^{(n-p) \\times (n-p)}$.\"\n\nSo the assumptions here are:\n\n1. A is a block upper triangular matrix with the given structure.\n2. A₁₁ is a complex p×p matrix.\n3. A₂₂ is a complex (n-p)×(n-p) matrix.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. So in the formatted problem, each is a line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a block upper triangular matrix with the structure [[A₁₁, A₁₂]; [0, A₂₂]],\nA₁₁ is a p×p complex matrix,\nA₂₂ is an (n-p)×(n-p) complex matrix.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the eigenvalues of A are the combined eigenvalues of A₁₁ and A₂₂.\n\nYes, that seems right. The problem is to show that the eigenvalues are the union of those of A₁₁ and A₂₂. So I think that's the correct formatting.",
