    "Content": "There's a trick I've been using to solve a common class of limit problems for a while now.  I've never seen it taught in a textbook, but I once wrote out a few lines of work to justify it to myself in one of my notebooks.  Here is a sample problem to illustrate my technique: $$\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\sqrt{x^2+x}-x=\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\sqrt{x^2+x+\\frac14}-x=\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\left(x+\\frac12\\right)-x=\\frac12$$ It's such a shortcut compared to rationalization or however you're \"supposed\" to solve that, and I'm quite certain that it's valid. But I'm starting to feel a little leery posting this as a solution to MSE problems since I don't quite remember the few lines of justification all those years ago.  Could someone please provide a proof that $$\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\sqrt{x^2+2\\alpha x}-\\sqrt{x^2+2\\alpha x+\\alpha^2}=0$$ or whatever equivalent formulation you would prefer?  I'm sure that delta-epsilon drudgery is not necessary at all.  (If nobody gets to this by the end of the day, I'll self-answer just to have something to link to.) Thanks!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "It need not be $\\alpha^2$ . Adding any constant $\\beta$ doesn't change the limit: $$\\lim\\limits_{x\\to\\infty}\\sqrt{x^2+2\\alpha x+\\beta}-\\sqrt{x^2+2\\alpha x}=\\lim\\limits_{x\\to\\infty}\\dfrac{\\beta}{\\sqrt{x^2+2\\alpha x+\\beta}+\\sqrt{x^2+2\\alpha x}}= 0$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants a proof that the limit of sqrt(x² + 2αx) - sqrt(x² + 2αx + α²) as x approaches infinity is zero. Hmm, first, I need to understand the structure here. Both terms under the square roots are quadratic in x. The first term is x² + 2αx, and the second is x² + 2αx + α². Wait a second, the second one looks like a perfect square. Let me check: x² + 2αx + α² is (x + α)². So sqrt(x² + 2αx + α²) is |x + α|, but since x is approaching infinity, x is positive, so this simplifies to x + α.\n\nBut the first term, sqrt(x² + 2αx), isn't a perfect square. However, maybe we can complete the square here as well. Let's see: x² + 2αx can be written as (x + α)² - α². So sqrt(x² + 2αx) is sqrt((x + α)² - α²). Alternatively, we can factor out x² from both terms. Wait, maybe that's another approach. Let's try to factor x² from inside the square roots.\n\nFor sqrt(x² + 2αx), factor x² to get x*sqrt(1 + 2α/x). Similarly, sqrt(x² + 2αx + α²) becomes x*sqrt(1 + 2α/x + α²/x²). Then, as x approaches infinity, 2α/x and α²/x² approach zero. Using the expansion sqrt(1 + ε) ≈ 1 + ε/2 - ε²/8 + ... for small ε, we can approximate both square roots.\n\nSo sqrt(1 + 2α/x) ≈ 1 + (2α)/(2x) - ( (2α/x)^2 )/8 + ... = 1 + α/x - (α²)/(2x²) + ...\nSimilarly, sqrt(1 + 2α/x + α²/x²) ≈ 1 + (2α/x + α²/x²)/2 - ( (2α/x + α²/x²)^2 )/8 + ... = 1 + α/x + α²/(2x²) - (4α²/x² + ...)/8 + ... which simplifies to 1 + α/x + α²/(2x²) - (α²)/(2x²) + ... = 1 + α/x + ... \n\nSubtracting these two approximations: [1 + α/x - (α²)/(2x²)] - [1 + α/x] = - (α²)/(2x²). Then multiplying back by x (since we factored out x earlier), but wait, no—actually, when we factored x² inside the sqrt, we had x*sqrt(...), so each term is x*(1 + α/x + ...). So the difference would be x*(1 + α/x - α²/(2x²)) - x*(1 + α/x + ...) = x*( - α²/(2x² )) = -α²/(2x). As x approaches infinity, this goes to zero. Therefore, the limit is zero.\n\nAlternatively, another method is to multiply and divide by the conjugate. Let's denote the expression as sqrt(x² + 2αx) - sqrt(x² + 2αx + α²). Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate: [sqrt(x² + 2αx) + sqrt(x² + 2αx + α²)]. So the expression becomes [ (sqrt(A) - sqrt(B))(sqrt(A) + sqrt(B)) ] / (sqrt(A) + sqrt(B)) ) = (A - B)/(sqrt(A) + sqrt(B)).\n\nCalculating A - B: (x² + 2αx) - (x² + 2αx + α²) = -α². So the numerator is -α², and the denominator is sqrt(x² + 2αx) + sqrt(x² + 2αx + α²). As x approaches infinity, sqrt(x² + 2αx) ≈ x + α (since sqrt(x² + 2αx) = x*sqrt(1 + 2α/x) ≈ x*(1 + α/x) = x + α). Similarly, sqrt(x² + 2αx + α²) = x + α. So the denominator is approximately (x + α) + (x + α) = 2x + 2α. Therefore, the expression becomes -α² / (2x + 2α). As x approaches infinity, this tends to zero.\n\nThus, both methods confirm that the limit is zero. The key steps are recognizing the conjugate pair for simplification or using binomial approximations for the square roots. The problem doesn't specify any restrictions on α, but since the original expression involves square roots, we might assume that the expressions under the roots are non-negative. However, as x approaches infinity, for large x, 2αx will dominate and the terms inside the square roots are positive regardless of α's sign. So maybe the only assumption is that x is approaching positive infinity, which is given. So the assumptions would be x approaches infinity, and maybe α is a real constant. The problem in the user's example had completing the square, but here it's more about simplifying the difference of two square roots. So structuring the problem accordingly.",
