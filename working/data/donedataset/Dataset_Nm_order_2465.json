    "Content": "Question: let $x,y,z>0$ and such $xyz=1$, show that\n  $$x^3+y^3+z^3+3\\ge 2(x^2+y^2+z^2)$$ My idea: use AM-GM inequality\n$$x^3+x^3+1\\ge 3x^2$$\n$$y^3+y^3+1\\ge 3y^2$$\n$$z^3+z^3+1\\ge 3z^2$$\nso\n$$2(x^3+y^3+z^3)+3\\ge 3(x^2+y^2+z^2)$$ But this is not my inequality,so How prove it? I know this condition is very important.but how use this condition? and this inequality is stronger",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here is a possible solution: (although it is not the most elegant one) I will employ Mixing Variables technique here. Since the inequality is symmetric, WLOG let $x=\\min(x,y,z)$. Therefore $t^2:=yz \\ge 1$. \nLet \n$$f(x,y,z)=x^3+y^3+z^3-2(x^2+y^2+z^2)$$\nI wish to show\n$$f(x,y,z)\\ge f(x,\\sqrt{yz},\\sqrt{yz}) = f(\\frac1{t^2},t,t) \\ge -3$$\nLet us put $p^2=x, q^2=y, r^2=z$. The first inequality in the above chain is equivalent to\n$$q^6+r^6-2q^3r^3 \\ge 2(q^4+r^4-2q^2r^2)$$\n$$\\iff (q^3-r^3)^2 \\ge 2(q^2-r^2)^2$$\n$$\\iff (q^2+qr+r^2)^2 \\ge 2(q+r)^2$$\nThis is true since\n$$(q^2+qr+r^2)^2 \\ge q^4+r^4+2q^2r^2+2qr(q^2+r^2) \\ge 4q^2r^2+2(q^2+r^2) \\ge 2(q+r)^2$$\nTherefore it enough to prove $f(\\frac1{t^2},t,t)\\ge -3$ for $t>0$ which is equivalent to\n$$(t-1)^2((t^7-2t^5+t^3)+(t^7+t-2t^4)+(t^4-t^3+t^2)+t+1)\\ge 0$$\nEach term in the brackets of the large factor is greater than zero by AM-GM. The last part is little tedious to do by hand. But you always know that $(t-1)$ has to be factor (possibly with multiplicity $2$) of that thing. That helps in simplification.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this problem. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure with Assumptions and Problem. \n\nLooking at the example provided, the original problem had some conditions and the formatted version listed each assumption line by line. The example extracted the key conditions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, actually, in the example, the original problem states \"for every integer n\" but the formatted assumption says \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me check again. Oh, the original problem in the example was to prove divisibility by 91, which is 7*13. But the user's formatted problem in the example added the assumption that n is divisible by 7. But the original problem says \"for every integer n\". Hmm, maybe there was an error in the example? Or perhaps the example was modified for illustration. Anyway, the key takeaway is that in the example, the user extracted assumptions as separate lines, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nNow, moving to the current problem. The original question is titled \"How prove this $x^3+y^3+z^3+3\\ge 2(x^2+y^2+z^2)$\" and the problem states: let x, y, z >0 and such that xyz=1, show that inequality holds.\n\nSo the assumptions here are:\n\n1. x is a positive real number.\n2. y is a positive real number.\n3. z is a positive real number.\n4. The product xyz equals 1.\n\nEach of these should be listed as separate lines under Assumption. Then the problem statement is to prove the inequality.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user wrote \"show that...\" So the assumptions are x, y, z positive and xyz=1. Then the problem is to prove the inequality.\n\nSo following the example structure, each variable's condition is listed separately, and the product condition is another line.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a positive real number,\ny is a positive real number,\nz is a positive real number,\nxyz equals 1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$x^3 + y^3 + z^3 + 3 \\ge 2(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$$\n\nWait, but the original problem in the question has \"x, y, z >0\" and \"xyz=1\". So each of x, y, z being positive is a separate assumption, and then the product equals 1 is another.\n\nYes, that's correct. So each assumption line should mention only one property for one object. So \"x is a positive real number\", \"y is...\", \"z is...\", then \"xyz=1\".\n\nTherefore, the answer should be structured as such.",
