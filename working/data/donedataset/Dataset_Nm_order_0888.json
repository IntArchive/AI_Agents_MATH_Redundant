    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is asking about the origin and proof of a specific formula involving pi. The formula given is π/2 equals an infinite sum of k! divided by (2k+1)!!. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The example provided listed assumptions about the variables involved, like n being an integer or divisible by a certain number. In this case, the problem doesn't explicitly state any conditions on k or the convergence of the series, but since it's an infinite sum, there might be an implicit assumption that the series converges. However, the user hasn't mentioned any specific conditions, so maybe there are no explicit assumptions here beyond the standard mathematical context for such series.\n\nWait, the problem is asking where the formula comes from and how to prove it. The user hasn't provided any additional constraints or conditions. So maybe there are no specific assumptions to list apart from the mathematical context required for the series to hold true. But the example included assumptions even when they were part of the problem statement. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem had the assumption that n is an integer, which was listed as an assumption. The problem was to prove divisibility by 91, but another assumption was that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no, looking back, the original example had the problem stating \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption and also \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect? Wait, let me check again. The original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem lists assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like a mistake. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption shouldn't include divisibility by 7 unless it's part of the problem. Maybe the example had a mistake. Hmm, this could be confusing. But perhaps in that example, there was a typo or error. Anyway, back to the current problem.\n\nIn this case, the formula is presented as an identity. The user wants to know where it comes from and how to prove it. Since there's no restriction mentioned on k, perhaps the assumption is that the summation is from k=0 to infinity, which is given. Also, the terms involve factorials and double factorials, which are defined for non-negative integers. So possible assumptions would be that k is a non-negative integer, and that the series converges. But usually, in such identities, the convergence might be part of the proof rather than an assumption. However, the problem is to prove the formula, so maybe the main assumption is that the series converges, but the user might not state that. Alternatively, maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond the structure of the sum. The example given in the original instruction had the user structure the problem with assumptions even if they were part of the problem statement. For instance, in the example, the problem said \"for every integer n\", and the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So following that pattern, here the problem is about the sum from k=0 to infinity, so perhaps the assumptions are that k is an integer, k is greater than or equal to 0, and the series converges. But the user hasn't specified any of these; they just presented the formula. So perhaps the only assumption is the definition of the terms involved. Alternatively, maybe there are no specific assumptions to list here, but according to the example, we should list any inherent conditions. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem is: π/2 equals the sum from k=0 to infinity of k! divided by (2k+1)!!. The question is to prove this formula. The assumptions needed would be that k is a non-negative integer (since factorial and double factorial are defined for such), and that the series converges. But the convergence might be part of what needs to be proven. However, the problem is to prove the equality, so maybe the main assumption is that the series converges, but since the user is asking for the proof, perhaps we should not include that as an assumption. Alternatively, maybe the problem has no specific assumptions beyond the standard mathematical definitions. The example included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption because the problem stated \"for every integer n\". Similarly, here, since the sum is from k=0 to infinity, perhaps the assumption is that k is an integer, k ≥ 0. So following that logic, the assumptions would be:\n\n- k is an integer.\n- k is greater than or equal to 0.\n- The series ∑_{k=0}^∞ [k! / (2k+1)!!] converges.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that this sum equals π/2. The convergence would be part of the proof, so maybe we shouldn't list that as an assumption. Alternatively, the user might not have any explicit assumptions beyond the summation setup. In the example, the assumption \"n is divisible by 7\" was added, but that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, looking back, the original problem in the example was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n + 1) - 6^n (3^n + 2^n) is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, the assumptions were \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption that n is divisible by 7 would be an added condition, which wasn't in the original problem. Maybe that example was a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem had a typo, and the user intended to have n divisible by 7. This confusion suggests that maybe in the current problem, the assistant should only list explicit assumptions from the problem statement. Since the current problem statement doesn't mention any conditions, but the formula involves a summation from k=0 to infinity, the only inherent assumptions are that k is an integer starting from 0. However, the example included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption even though it was part of the problem's quantifier. So following that pattern, here the sum is over k starting at 0, so the assumptions would be:\n\n- k is an integer.\n- k is greater than or equal to 0.\n\nBut perhaps in the context of the problem, these are considered given, so they should be listed as assumptions. Therefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nk is an integer,\nk is greater than or equal to 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\frac{\\pi}{2}=\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{k!}{\\left(2k+1\\right)!!}.$$\n\nBut wait, the example had the assumption that n is divisible by 7 even though the original problem didn't state that. That suggests maybe the example was incorrect, or perhaps there was a misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe in that example, the assistant made a mistake. Given that confusion, perhaps for the current problem, since there are no explicit conditions given beyond the summation indices, the assumptions are just that k is a non-negative integer, which is inherent in the summation notation. Therefore, following the example's structure where assumptions are listed even if they are part of the problem's phrasing, here we would list:\n\nAssumption:\nk is an integer,\nk is greater than or equal to 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\frac{\\pi}{2}=\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{k!}{\\left(2k+1\\right)!!}.$$\n\nAlternatively, if the problem doesn't specify any conditions beyond the summation, maybe there are no assumptions to list. But the example included \"n is an integer\" even though the problem stated \"for every integer n\", so following that, we should list the assumptions related to the variables in the problem. Since the summation index k starts at 0 and goes to infinity, the natural assumptions are that k is an integer and non-negative. Therefore, those would be the assumptions.",
