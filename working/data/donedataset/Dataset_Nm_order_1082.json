    "Content": "Suppose $(M,d)$ a metric space. I want to show that If every continuous real-valued function on $M$ attains a maximum, then $(M, d)$ is compact. I was trying to do this by assuming $M$ non-compact and showing explicitly a function which does not attain a maximum. If $M$ is not bounded it's enough to take the distance from a fixed point as we can always find a sequence which \"exits\" every compact and pushes the distance at infinity. But what if $M$ is bounded?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If $M$ is not compact then there is a sequence $(x_n)$ without convergent subsequences. The sequence is a closed discrete subspace so the map $f: \\{x_n:n\\in\\mathbb N\\}\\to \\mathbb R$ given by $x_n\\to n$ is continuous. By the Tietze extension theorem it has a continuous extension $F: M\\to\\mathbb R$. Clearly, $F$ is unbounded.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about proving that a metric space (M, d) is compact if every continuous real-valued function on M attains a maximum. The user wants to approach this by assuming M is not compact and constructing a function that doesn't attain its maximum.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The problem states that (M, d) is a metric space. Then, the key assumption is that every continuous real-valued function on M attains a maximum. The goal is to show that under this condition, M must be compact. \n\nIn the example provided, assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property. Here, the main assumptions are:\n\n1. (M, d) is a metric space.\n2. Every continuous function f: M → ℝ attains a maximum.\n\nThe problem then is to prove that M is compact. However, in the example, the user included an assumption from the original problem (n is divisible by 7) even though it wasn't explicitly stated. Wait, in the example, the original problem was about proving divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be an error. Wait, looking back, the original example says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, the assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect because the original problem didn't state that. Wait, maybe the example was a mistake. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe the user intended to correct the example, but perhaps the example was wrong. Regardless, the task here is to structure the current problem correctly.\n\nIn the current problem, the user on Math Exchange is trying to prove that if every continuous real function on M attains a maximum, then M is compact. The user's approach is to assume M is not compact and construct a function that doesn't attain a maximum. The user mentions handling the case where M is not bounded by using the distance function, but is stuck on the case where M is bounded but not compact (i.e., not totally bounded). \n\nThe key assumptions here are:\n\n1. (M, d) is a metric space.\n2. Every continuous real-valued function f: M → ℝ attains its maximum.\n\nThe problem is to prove that under these assumptions, (M, d) is compact.\n\nWait, but in the example provided by the user, the formatted problem added an assumption that wasn't in the original (about n being divisible by 7). However, in this case, the original problem doesn't have extra assumptions; it's a direct implication. The user is supposed to list all the assumptions given in the problem. The original problem says \"If every continuous real-valued function on M attains a maximum, then (M, d) is compact.\" So the assumptions are:\n\n- (M, d) is a metric space.\n- Every continuous function f: M → ℝ attains a maximum.\n\nTherefore, the problem is to show that under these two conditions, M is compact. The user's attempt is considering the cases where M is not compact (either not bounded or not totally bounded). But according to the problem statement, the assumptions are those two, so the formatted problem should reflect that. The example given by the user might have been incorrect, but following the instructions, we need to filter out unrelated information and structure the problem with its actual assumptions.",
