    "Content": "I am currently trying to understand the following proof that $A_5$ is a simple group. I only have the proof in German, so the following is only my translation. I really want to understand this proof. I have seen other proof (e.g. in this question or on subwiki ), but I would like to understand the one below. So I wrote Theorem : $A_5$ is simple To show: $A_5$ has only $A_5$ and $\\{Identity\\}$ as normal groups Proof : The number of elements in $A_n$ is $\\frac{n!}{2}$, so $|A_5| = 60 = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5$. The 3- and 5- Sylowgroups are isomorph to $\\mathbb{Z}/3 \\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\mathbb{Z}/5 \\mathbb{Z}$, so they are cyclic. With the Sylow-theorems we know that: $60 = 3^1 \\cdot 20$ The number of 3-Sylow groups of $A_5$ divides 20 The number of 3-Sylow groups of $A_5$ is of the form $1+k \\cdot 3$ with $k \\in \\mathbb{N}_0$ $\\Rightarrow$ The number of 3-Sylow groups of $A_5$ is in $\\{1,4,10\\}$ $60 = 5^1 \\cdot 12$ The number of 5-Sylow groups of $A_5$ divides 12 The number of 5-Sylow groups of $A_5$ is of the form $1+k \\cdot 5$ with $k \\in \\mathbb{N}_0$ $\\Rightarrow$ The number of 3-Sylow groups of $A_5$ is in $\\{1,6\\}$ $60 = 2^2 \\cdot 15$ The number of 2-Sylow groups of $A_5$ divides 15 The number of 2-Sylow groups of $A_5$ is of the form $1+k \\cdot 2$ with $k \\in \\mathbb{N}_0$ One 2-Sylowgroup of $A_5$ is the Klein four group : $V_4 = \\{(1~2)(3~4), (1~3)(2~4), (1~4,2~3), Id\\}$ $\\Rightarrow$ The number of 2-Sylow groups of $A_5$ is in $\\{1,3,5,15\\}$ Question 1 : Somehow it seems to be clear that the number of 3-Sylow groups is 10, the number of 5-Sylowgroups is 6 and the number\n  of 2-Sylowgroups is 5. Why is this clear? Could you explain that to\n  me? $A_5$ is generated by 3-cycles and thus also by 5-cycles, because:\n$$(1~2~3~4~5) \\circ (1~3~2~5~4) = (1~4~2)$$ Let $N \\lhd A_5$ be a normal subgroup with more than one element.\nIf $\\#N | p, \\;\\;\\; p \\in \\{3,5\\}$, then $N$ has a $p$-Sylow group of $A_5$. This means, $N$ has to have all $p$-Sylow groups (thus all $p$ cycles). This means $N=A_5$ Question 2 : Why can't $N$ have only one $p$-Sylow group of $A_5$\n  and still be a normal subgroup? And the cardinality $\\# N$ cannot be a power of two as the center $Z(A_5) = \\{Id\\}$. This means $|N| > 2$. Question 3 : I don't understand how the center is related to the number\n  of elements of $N$. $N$ can't be a 2-Sylow group as all 2-Sylow groups are conjugated. Question 4 : I know that all 2-Sylow groups are conjugated because of Sylow theorems. But why does this mean that $N$ can't be a 2-Sylow\n  group? It follows that $N = A_5 \\blacksquare$ Question 5 : Why does this follow? Why does $N$ have to be a p-Sylow group? Notation and definitions I'm not sure if I used the correct English words. So here are some definitions: Let $G$ be a group. The center is defined as $\\mathrm Z(G):=\\{z \\in G \\mid \\forall g \\in G : gz=zg\\}.$ Let $G$ be a group. The number of elements of $G$ is denoted as $|G|$ or $\\#G$. Let $G$ be a group.\n$x, y \\in G$ are conjugated $:\\Leftrightarrow \\exists g \\in G: x = gxg^{-1}$. Let $G$ be a group. $G$ is called a $p$-group $:\\Leftrightarrow$ the order of each element of $G$ is $p$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Q1: There are $\\frac{5\\cdot4\\cdot 3}3=20$ three-cycles in $A_5$, and each is in a $3$-Sylow group, whereas each $3$-Sylow group consists of two elements of order three (plus the identity). Hence the number of $3$-Sylow groups is exactly $10$. Likewise, each $5$-Sylow group contains four elements of order $5$ and there are $\\frac{5!}5$ such elements. Each choice of four numbers in $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$ gives rise to a copy of the Klein 4-group, hence there are $5$ such subgroups. Q2 : As $A_5$ acts transitively on the set of its $p$-Sylow groups by conjugation and a normal subgroup is invariant under conjugation, we have this all-or-nothing situation: If $N$ contains one $p$-Sylow group, it must contain all its conjugates. Q3: If $\\#N=2$ then the nontrivial element must be fix under conjugation, i.e. central. If $\\#N=4$ it must be one of those Klein 4-groups and $\\#N=8,16,\\ldots$ is not possible Q4: See Q2. Any subgroup is normal iff it is invariant under conjugation. Q5 We have seen in Q2 that $N=A_5$ if $3|\\#N$ or $5|\\#N$, hence from $1<\\#N|60$ we are left only with $\\#N\\in\\{2,4\\}$ to check. This was shown impossible in Q3, Q4.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that the assumptions should list each condition or property applied to one object per line, and then state the problem.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original problem. The title is \"Why is $A_5$ a simple group?\" and the user has several questions about the proof presented. The main problem is to understand why certain steps in the proof hold, specifically regarding the number of Sylow subgroups and why a normal subgroup $N$ must be trivial or the whole group.\n\nLooking at the example, the assumptions were about the properties of $n$ and the divisibility. Here, the assumptions would relate to the properties of $A_5$, Sylow theorems, and the structure of normal subgroups.\n\nThe original proof uses Sylow theorems to argue about the number of Sylow subgroups. The user has questions about why the counts of Sylow subgroups are 10, 6, and 5 for 3-, 5-, and 2-Sylow groups respectively. Also, they question why a normal subgroup can't have a single p-Sylow group, the role of the center, and why N can't be a 2-Sylow group.\n\nTo structure this into the format, the assumptions should list all the given conditions. For example:\n\n- $A_5$ is the alternating group on 5 elements.\n- The order of $A_5$ is 60.\n- Sylow theorems apply to $A_5$.\n- 3-Sylow subgroups are cyclic and isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$.\n- Similarly for 5-Sylow.\n- The 2-Sylow subgroups are Klein four-groups.\n- The number of Sylow subgroups must satisfy certain divisibility and congruence conditions.\n- Normal subgroups must be unions of conjugacy classes.\n\nEach assumption should be a single line addressing one property. Then, the problem is to understand why the number of Sylow subgroups is as stated and why a nontrivial normal subgroup must be $A_5$ itself.\n\nI need to check each part of the user's questions and see what assumptions are underlying each question. For example, Question 1 is about why the counts are 10, 6, 5. The assumptions here would include the Sylow theorems' conditions on the number of Sylow subgroups. Question 2 relates to normal subgroups containing all Sylow subgroups if they contain one. The center being trivial implies that a normal subgroup can't have order a power of 2, which relates to the assumption about the center. \n\nI'll need to list all these properties as separate assumptions. Then, the problem is to answer the user's specific questions, which are about the steps in the proof. But according to the format, the problem should be the main question to solve, which in the original post is proving that $A_5$ is simple. However, the user's specific questions are about understanding parts of the proof. But following the example, the problem should be the main problem, which is proving $A_5$ is simple, and the assumptions are the given conditions used in the proof. The user's specific questions (Q1-Q5) are part of their confusion but the main problem is still proving simplicity. Alternatively, maybe the problem here is to answer the user's specific questions, but the example shows that the problem is the main theorem. Hmm.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted problem kept that as the problem, with assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. But in this case, the original problem is \"Why is $A_5$ a simple group?\" which is the main problem. The user's questions are about understanding specific steps in the proof. So perhaps the problem here is the main theorem, and the assumptions are the conditions given in the proof.\n\nSo, structuring this, the assumptions would include things like:\n\n- $A_5$ has order 60.\n- Sylow theorems apply to $A_5$.\n- The number of Sylow subgroups must divide certain numbers and be congruent to 1 mod p.\n- 3-Sylow, 5-Sylow, and 2-Sylow groups are cyclic or Klein four-groups.\n- Normal subgroups must be unions of conjugacy classes.\n- The center of $A_5$ is trivial.\n- All Sylow subgroups of a given order are conjugate.\n\nEach of these as separate lines. Then the problem is to prove $A_5$ is simple.\n\nBut the user's specific questions are about understanding parts of the proof. However, according to the format, the problem is the main problem to be solved. So perhaps the user's specific questions are part of the problem's details but the main problem is still proving $A_5$ is simple. However, in the example, the formatted problem included the specific problem statement from the original question. Here, the original problem is \"Prove $A_5$ is simple,\" so that's the problem. The user's questions 1-5 are their specific confusions in understanding the proof, but the task is to structure the original problem (from the Math SE post) into the format. So perhaps the problem is the original question, which is \"Why is $A_5$ a simple group?\" with the assumptions being the conditions and properties used in the proof provided.\n\nAlternatively, if the user's own questions (Q1-Q5) are part of the problem statement, then the problem would be to answer those questions. But in the example, the formatted problem was the original problem, not the user's subsequent questions. The example had the original problem as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91,\" and the formatted problem kept that as the problem, with assumptions.\n\nSo applying that here, the problem is the original question: \"Prove that $A_5$ is a simple group.\" The user's specific questions (Q1-Q5) are their own confusions in understanding the proof, but the formatted problem should capture the original problem's statement and assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be the conditions given in the proof steps, such as:\n\n- The order of $A_5$ is 60.\n- Sylow theorems apply to $A_5$.\n- The number of 3-Sylow subgroups divides 20 and is congruent to 1 mod 3.\n- Similarly for 5-Sylow and 2-Sylow.\n- The 2-Sylow subgroups are Klein four-groups.\n- $A_5$ is generated by 3-cycles or 5-cycles.\n- The center of $A_5$ is trivial.\n- All Sylow subgroups of the same order are conjugate.\n\nEach of these as separate assumptions. Then the problem is to prove $A_5$ is simple.\n\nBut need to check if the original proof's statements are part of the problem or assumptions. The user presents a proof attempt and asks about specific steps. But according to the task, the goal is to filter the unrelated information and structure the problem as per the format. The original problem is to prove $A_5$ is simple, and the user has provided a proof with certain steps and has questions about them. However, in the example, the formatted problem focused on the main problem and listed assumptions from the problem statement. So perhaps here, the problem is the main theorem, and the assumptions are the conditions given in the proof.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is as stated in the user's translation: \"Theorem: $A_5$ is simple. To show: $A_5$ has only $A_5$ and {Identity} as normal groups.\" Then the assumptions would be the premises used in the proof, such as Sylow theorems, the order of $A_5$, properties of Sylow subgroups, etc.\n\nTherefore, I need to list each assumption from the proof that is necessary to prove the simplicity. For instance:\n\nAssumptions:\n- $|A_5| = 60 = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5$.\n- 3-Sylow subgroups of $A_5$ are cyclic and isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$.\n- 5-Sylow subgroups of $A_5$ are cyclic and isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z}$.\n- The number of 3-Sylow subgroups divides 20 and is congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n- The number of 5-Sylow subgroups divides 12 and is congruent to 1 modulo 5.\n- The number of 2-Sylow subgroups divides 15 and is congruent to 1 modulo 2.\n- A 2-Sylow subgroup of $A_5$ is the Klein four-group $V_4$.\n- $A_5$ is generated by 3-cycles.\n- The center of $A_5$ is trivial.\n- All Sylow subgroups of the same order are conjugate.\n- A normal subgroup must be a union of conjugacy classes.\n- If a normal subgroup contains a Sylow subgroup, it must contain all its conjugates.\n\nEach of these points as separate lines. Then the problem is to prove that $A_5$ is simple, i.e., has no nontrivial normal subgroups.\n\nBut some of these might be derived from more basic assumptions. For example, the structure of Sylow subgroups follows from the order of the group and Sylow theorems. However, in the original proof, the user mentions these as given, so they should be considered assumptions for the purpose of structuring.\n\nI need to ensure each assumption is a single property. For example:\n\n- $A_5$ has order 60.\n- The 3-Sylow subgroups of $A_5$ are cyclic.\n- The number of 3-Sylow subgroups divides 20.\n- The number of 3-Sylow subgroups is congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n- Similarly for 5-Sylow and 2-Sylow.\n- The Klein four-group is a 2-Sylow subgroup of $A_5$.\n- $A_5$ is generated by 3-cycles.\n- The center of $A_5$ is trivial.\n- All 2-Sylow subgroups of $A_5$ are conjugate.\n- A normal subgroup of $A_5$ must contain all conjugates of any of its Sylow subgroups.\n\nEach of these as separate lines. Then the problem is to prove that $A_5$ is simple.\n\nI think this approach covers the necessary assumptions mentioned in the original proof attempt. The user's specific questions (Q1-Q5) are their points of confusion but aren't part of the formatted problem, which should focus on the main problem and its assumptions.\n\nTherefore, structuring accordingly.",
