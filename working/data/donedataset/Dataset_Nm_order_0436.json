    "Content": "The following form of Taylor's Theorem with minimal hypotheses is not widely popular and goes by the name of Taylor's Theorem with Peano's Form of Remainder : Taylor's Theorem with Peano's Form of Remainder : If $f$ is a function such that its $n^{\\text{th}}$ derivative at $a$ (i.e. $f^{(n)}(a)$) exists then $$f(a + h) = f(a) + hf'(a) + \\frac{h^{2}}{2!}f''(a) + \\cdots + \\frac{h^{n}}{n!}f^{(n)}(a) + o(h^{n})$$ where $o(h^{n})$ represents a function $g(h)$ with $g(h)/h^{n} \\to 0$ as $h \\to 0$. One of the proofs (search \"Proof of Taylor's Theorem\" in this blog post ) of this theorem uses repeated application of L'Hospital's Rule. And it appears that proofs of the above theorem  apart from the one via L'Hospital's Rule are not well known . I have asked this question to get other proofs of this theorem which do not rely on L'Hospital's Rule and instead use simpler ideas. BTW I am also posting one proof of my own as a community wiki.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "We will prove the result for $h \\to 0^{+}$ and the argument for $h \\to 0^{-}$ is similar. The proof is taken from my favorite book A Course of Pure Mathematics by G. H. Hardy. Since $f^{(n)}(a)$ exists it follows that $f^{(n - 1)}(x)$ exists in some neighborhood of $a$ and $f^{(n - 2)}(x)$ is continuous in that neighborhood of $a$. Let $h \\geq 0$ and we define another function $$F_{n}(h) = f(a + h) - \\left\\{f(a) + hf'(a) + \\frac{h^{2}}{2!}f''(a) + \\cdots + \\frac{h^{n - 1}}{(n - 1)!}f^{(n - 1)}(a)\\right\\}\\tag{1}$$ Then $F_{n}(h)$ and its first $(n - 1)$ derivatives vanish at $h = 0$ and $F_{n}^{(n)}(0) = f^{(n)}(a)$. Hence if we write $$G(h) = F_{n}(h) - \\frac{h^{n}}{n!}\\{f^{(n)}(a) - \\epsilon\\}\\tag{2}$$ where $\\epsilon > 0$, then we have $$G(0) = 0, G'(0) = 0, \\ldots, G^{(n - 1)}(0) = 0, G^{(n)}(0) = \\epsilon > 0\\tag{3}$$ Since $G^{(n)}(0) > 0$ it follows that there is a number $\\delta_{1} > 0$ such that $G^{(n - 1)}(h) > 0$ for all values of $h$ with $0 < h < \\delta_{1}$. Using mean value theorem and noting that $G^{(n - 1)}(0) = 0$ we can see that $G^{(n - 2)}(h) > 0$ for all $h$ with $0 < h < \\delta_{1}$. Applying the same argument repeatedly we can see that $G(h) > 0$ for all $h$ wih $0 < h < \\delta_{1}$. Thus $$F_{n}(h) > \\frac{h^{n}}{n!}\\{f^{(n)}(a) - \\epsilon\\}\\tag{4}$$ for $0 < h < \\delta_{1}$. Similarly we can prove that $$F_{n}(h) < \\frac{h^{n}}{n!}\\{f^{(n)}(a) + \\epsilon\\}\\tag{5}$$ for all $h$ with $0 < h < \\delta_{2}$. Thus for every $\\epsilon > 0$ there is a $\\delta = \\min(\\delta_{1}, \\delta_{2}) > 0$ such that $$\\frac{h^{n}}{n!}\\{f^{(n)}(a) - \\epsilon\\} < F_{n}(h) < \\frac{h^{n}}{n!}\\{f^{(n)}(a) + \\epsilon\\}\\tag{6}$$ for all values of $h$ with $0 < h < \\delta$. This proves the theorem for $h \\to 0^{+}$. Slight care has to be taken when dealing with negative values of $h$ for the case $h \\to 0^{-}$ because here the nature of inequalities will depend on whether $n$ is odd or even and thus we need to handle both the cases of even $n$ and odd $n$ separately.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. The example provided shows that the assumption part lists each condition applied to one object, and the problem part states the main question.\n\nLooking at the original problem here: The question is about Taylor's Theorem with Peano's Form of Remainder. The user mentions that the theorem's proof using L’Hospital's Rule is common, but they want other proofs without it. The original theorem statement is given with the conditions.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The theorem states that if a function f has an nth derivative at a point a, then the expansion holds with the remainder being o(h^n). The assumptions here are about the function f and its derivatives. Specifically, the existence of the nth derivative at a. The problem is to prove the theorem without using L’Hospital's Rule.\n\nWait, the example given in the user's example had the assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Each assumption is a single property. So here, the main assumption is that f has an nth derivative at a. So the assumption should be that the nth derivative of f exists at a. Then the problem is to prove the Taylor expansion with Peano's remainder without using L’Hospital's Rule.\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is one line, one condition. The problem part should state the problem as given. The original problem is asking for alternative proofs, but the formatted problem should just state the theorem to be proven under the assumptions. The user's example didn't include the request for alternative proofs in the problem statement, just the theorem. So maybe the problem part here is to \"Prove that [the Taylor expansion with Peano remainder]\" under the given assumption.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the assumptions would be about the function f and the existence of the nth derivative at a. Let me check again. The theorem states \"If f is a function such that its nth derivative at a exists\", so the assumption is that f^{(n)}(a) exists. Therefore, the assumption line is: f is a function, f^{(n)}(a) exists.\n\nBut the example structured each assumption line with one object and one condition. So for example, in the example, they had two lines: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Here, the function f has the nth derivative at a. So perhaps two assumptions: 1. f is a function. 2. The nth derivative of f at a exists (i.e., f^{(n)}(a) exists). But maybe \"f is a function\" is too generic, but the example included \"n is an integer\" as a separate assumption. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the main assumption is that f is n-times differentiable at a. But the problem states \"its nth derivative at a (i.e., f^{(n)}(a)) exists\", so the key assumption is the existence of the nth derivative at a. The function f is given, but perhaps the key condition is the existence of the derivative. So maybe the assumption is \"f is a function such that its nth derivative at a (f^{(n)}(a)) exists\". But the example's first assumption was \"n is an integer\", so maybe breaking it down. However, in the example, the user added an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, the assumption included that n is divisible by 7, which seems like a mistake. Wait, the original example's formatted problem seems incorrect. Wait, let me check the example again. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", and the formatted problem's assumption is \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7. That seems like an error. Wait, maybe the example was a mistake. Because the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7, which would actually make the problem weaker. So perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user wants me to follow the format regardless. So perhaps in their example, they filtered out some conditions, but in reality, that might not be the case. However, the user provided that example as a guide, so I need to follow the structure, even if the example has an error.\n\nBut in the current problem, the Taylor's theorem's assumption is just that the nth derivative exists at a. So maybe in the assumption section, list that \"f is a function\", \"f has an nth derivative at a (i.e., f^{(n)}(a) exists)\". But perhaps \"f is a function\" is part of the problem's premise and not an assumption. Wait, the problem is about functions, so maybe the main assumption is just the existence of the nth derivative. Let me check the original problem statement again.\n\nThe original problem states: \"If f is a function such that its nth derivative at a (i.e., f^{(n)}(a)) exists then [the expansion holds]\". So the key assumption is that f^{(n)}(a) exists. Therefore, the assumption should be: \"f is a function such that its nth derivative at a exists\". But according to the example's format, each assumption is a single line addressing one property. So perhaps split into two: 1. f is a function. 2. The nth derivative of f at a, f^{(n)}(a), exists. However, in the example, the user had two separate assumptions about n. Maybe that's how it's intended. So here, f is a function is one assumption, and the existence of the nth derivative is another.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first line is \"f is a function with an nth derivative at a\", but that would combine two properties. The example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate lines. So perhaps here, \"f is a function\" and \"the nth derivative of f at a exists\" are separate lines. But is \"f is a function\" an assumption? It's part of the theorem's statement. Maybe the key is that the problem is about functions with that derivative existing, so the main assumption is the existence of the derivative. However, the example seems to list even basic premises like \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So following that, here, \"f is a function\" is one assumption, and \"the nth derivative of f at a exists\" is another.\n\nBut maybe in the original problem, \"f is a function\" is not an assumption but part of the problem's context. Hmm. It's a bit ambiguous. The example might have included \"n is an integer\" even though the problem stated \"for every integer n\". So perhaps the user wants all the conditions listed, even if they are part of the problem's premise.\n\nIn the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But wait, the original problem was to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, the assumption is that n is an integer and divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in their example. Maybe the original problem was to prove that for every integer n divisible by 7, the expression is divisible by 91. But the user's example original problem says \"for every integer n\". So maybe the formatted problem in the example is incorrect, but the user provided it as a sample. Regardless, I need to follow the user's instructions.\n\nTherefore, in the current problem, the key assumption is that the nth derivative of f at a exists. So the assumption line would be: \"The nth derivative of f at a (f^{(n)}(a)) exists.\" And the problem is to prove the Taylor expansion with Peano's remainder. Additionally, the original question mentions the desire to get proofs without using L’Hospital's Rule, but the formatted problem should state the problem, not the request for alternative proofs. Wait, the example included the problem statement as \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91\", even though the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n...\". So in the example, the user added an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) which wasn't in the original problem, which might have been a mistake, but in the current problem, the user's formatted problem should include the problem statement as given, just structured.\n\nWait, but the original problem here is the user asking for alternative proofs. However, according to the example, the problem part is just the theorem to prove. So the problem here should be to \"Prove that f(a + h) = ... + o(h^n)\" under the given assumption, without mentioning the method (i.e., not including the request for avoiding L’Hospital's Rule). But the original question's actual request is to get proofs that do not use L’Hospital's Rule, so perhaps the problem statement should reflect that. But the example's problem part was just the theorem to prove. Hmm.\n\nWait, in the example, the user's formatted problem was to prove the expression is divisible by 91, with assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But the original problem was to prove it for every integer n. So perhaps the user's example is incorrect, but following their structure, the problem part is just the statement to prove, and the assumptions are the conditions needed. However, in the current problem, the original question is asking for a proof of Taylor's theorem with Peano's remainder without using L’Hospital's Rule. But the problem statement should be the theorem itself, not the request for the proof method. The user's instruction says to structure the problem as per the example, which in the example, the problem part is the mathematical statement to prove. So here, the problem is to prove the Taylor expansion with Peano's remainder, given that f^(n)(a) exists. The fact that the original question is asking for proofs without L’Hospital's Rule is part of the motivation, but the actual problem to structure is the theorem itself. The user's example didn't include the \"prove using XYZ method\" in the problem statement; it just had the theorem. Therefore, the problem part here should be \"Prove that [the Taylor expansion]...\" without mentioning the method, and the assumptions are the existence of the nth derivative. However, the original question mentions that the user wants proofs without L’Hospital's Rule. But according to the example, such context is omitted. Therefore, the formatted problem would have the assumptions about the function's derivative and the problem is to prove the expansion. However, in the original Math Stack Exchange question, the user explicitly asks for proofs not using L’Hospital's Rule, so maybe that should be included in the problem statement. But the example didn't include such a constraint. For instance, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem's problem part was \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91\", even though the original problem was more general. So following that, here, the problem part should be \"Prove that [Taylor's theorem statement]\" under the given assumptions, and the context about avoiding L’Hospital's Rule is part of the original question's request but not the problem statement itself. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a function,\nThe nth derivative of f at a (f^{(n)}(a)) exists.\n\nProblem:\nProve that\n$$f(a + h) = f(a) + hf'(a) + \\frac{h^{2}}{2!}f''(a) + \\cdots + \\frac{h^{n}}{n!}f^{(n)}(a) + o(h^{n})$$\nwhere $o(h^{n})$ represents a function $g(h)$ with $g(h)/h^{n} \\to 0$ as $h \\to 0$.\n\nBut the original problem's user is asking for proofs that don't use L’Hospital's Rule. However, according to the example, such a request is not included in the formatted problem. The example included the problem as the mathematical statement. So I think the answer should structure the problem as the theorem to prove, with assumptions on the function's derivative. The fact that the user wants alternative proofs is part of the context but not the problem statement itself. Therefore, the final formatted problem should list the assumptions about the function and its derivative, then state the problem as proving the Taylor expansion with Peano's remainder.",
