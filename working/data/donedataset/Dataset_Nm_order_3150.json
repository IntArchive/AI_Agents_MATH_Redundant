    "Content": "Let $X$ be a topological space, and $F$ and $G$ be two sheaves of sets on $X$. Let $\\eta : F \\rightarrow G$ be a morphism of sheaves. Then how would you show the following: $\\eta$ is an epimorphism in the category of sheaves of sets on $X$ if and only if for all $x \\in X$, the induced maps on stalks $\\eta_{x}: F_x \\rightarrow G_x$ are surjective. (1) Here are a few comments: In Algebraic Geometry Chapter 2, Proposition 1.1, Hartshorne proves that in the setup as above $\\eta$ is an isomorphism if and only if for all $x \\in X$ the induced maps on stalks $\\eta_x : F_x \\rightarrow G_x$ are bijective (he considers sheaves of abelian groups, so in his statement $\\eta_x$ are isomorphisms, but the proof remains valid if we consider sheaves of sets). But, in this proof he relies on the following nice fact: $\\eta$ is an isomorphism if and only if for all open $U \\subset X$, the component maps $\\eta(U) : F(U) \\rightarrow G(U)$ are bijective. I have never really seen a proof of the following analogous fact (which could be helpful in solving the problem): $\\eta$ is an epimorphism if and only if for all open $U \\subset X$, $\\eta(U): F(U) \\rightarrow G(U)$ is surjective (2) . ((I think (2) is true, but hopefully there is a solution to my problem without using this fact.)) Even if we assume (2) to be a true statement, then to prove the backward implication of (1) we still cannot extend Hartshorne's method, for when he shows that for all open $U \\subset X$, $\\eta(U): F(U) \\rightarrow G(U)$ is surjective, he needs the assumption that $\\eta(U)$ are injective, which he proves beforehand. With these comments, which probably show that I am thinking about the problem incorrectly, can someone give me an indication of how to prove (1) ?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $X$ be a topological space, and let $\\alpha : \\mathscr{F} \\to \\mathscr{G}$ be a morphism of sheaves on $X$. Let $j : \\{ x \\} \\hookrightarrow X$ be the inclusion of a point into $X$. Then, by definition, the stalk of $\\mathscr{F}$ at $x$ is just the inverse image sheaf $j^* \\mathscr{F}$. But we know $j^* \\dashv j_*$ (i.e. the inverse image functor $j^*$ is left adjoint to the direct image functor $j_*$), and left adjoints preserve colimits, hence if $\\alpha$ is epic, so is $\\alpha_x : \\mathscr{F}_x \\to \\mathscr{G}_x$. Conversely, suppose $\\alpha_x : \\mathscr{F}_x \\to \\mathscr{G}_x$ is surjective for every $x$ in $X$. Let $\\beta, \\gamma : \\mathscr{G} \\to \\mathscr{H}$ be two further morphisms of sheaves, and suppose $\\beta \\circ \\alpha = \\gamma \\circ \\alpha$. We need to show $\\beta = \\gamma$. Certainly, we have $\\beta_x \\circ \\alpha_x = \\gamma_x \\circ \\alpha_x$, and $\\alpha_x$ is epic by hypothesis, so we have $\\beta_x = \\gamma_x$ for all $x$ in $X$. Let $s \\in \\mathscr{G}(U)$, and consider $\\beta_U(s)$ and $\\gamma_U(s)$. Since $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ agree on germs, at each $x$ in $U$ there is an open neighbourhood $V$ on which $\\beta_V(s|_V) = \\gamma_V(s|_V)$, and so by the unique collation property, we must have $\\beta_U(s) = \\gamma_U(s)$, and therefore we indeed have $\\beta = \\gamma$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to format this problem according to the user's specifications. Let me first read through the original question carefully. The user is asking about proving that a morphism of sheaves of sets is an epimorphism if and only if the induced maps on all stalks are surjective. They mention Hartshorne's proposition where isomorphisms correspond to bijective stalk maps, and they want to extend this idea to epimorphisms. They also reference a potential fact (2) about surjectivity on all open sets, but are unsure how to proceed without it.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem is set in the context of sheaves of sets on a topological space X. The morphism in question is η: F → G between two sheaves F and G. The user wants to show the equivalence between η being an epimorphism in the category and η_x being surjective on stalks for all x in X.\n\nSo, the assumptions should list all the given conditions. Let's parse each part:\n\n1. X is a topological space. (This is stated in the problem.)\n2. F and G are sheaves of sets on X. (Both sheaves are defined on X.)\n3. η: F → G is a morphism of sheaves. (The morphism is between the two sheaves.)\n4. The category in question is the category of sheaves of sets on X. (Since the problem mentions epimorphism in this category.)\n5. The equivalence to prove involves the induced maps on stalks η_x being surjective for all x in X. (The problem statement says \"if and only if for all x ∈ X, the induced maps on stalks η_x: F_x → G_x are surjective.\")\n\nWait, but the problem is to show that η is an epimorphism if and only if all η_x are surjective. So the assumptions should include the setup (X is topological space, F, G sheaves, η a morphism), but the actual conditions to prove are the equivalence. However, in the example provided, the assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, the problem is more about the conditions given in the problem statement. But in this case, the problem is to prove an equivalence, so the assumptions are the general setup, not specific conditions. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem had A(n) defined with 5^n and 6^n terms, and the formatted problem listed assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem's assumption added \"n is divisible by 7\", which seems incorrect. Wait, no, looking back, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) [...] is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem's assumption says \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, that seems like a mistake. Because the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7. So maybe the example is wrong? Or perhaps the user intended to have a different problem. Hmm, perhaps that example was a mistake, but the user provided it as an example. Anyway, proceeding with the current problem.\n\nSo, for the current problem, the setup is that X is a topological space, F and G are sheaves of sets on X, η is a morphism between them. The problem is to show η is an epimorphism in the category of sheaves of sets on X if and only if all induced stalk maps η_x are surjective.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n1. X is a topological space.\n2. F is a sheaf of sets on X.\n3. G is a sheaf of sets on X.\n4. η: F → G is a morphism of sheaves.\n5. The category under consideration is the category of sheaves of sets on X.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to prove an equivalence, so the \"if and only if\" is part of the problem statement. The assumptions are the given conditions. So the user is to structure the problem by listing the assumptions (the setup) and then the problem statement.\n\nIn the example, even though the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7, the formatted problem added that as an assumption. That might have been an error, but maybe the user intended to structure the problem with any given assumptions. Wait, perhaps the original problem had a typo, or maybe the user made a mistake. But in any case, for the current problem, we need to list the assumptions from the problem as given.\n\nThe original question states: Let X be a topological space, F and G be two sheaves of sets on X. Let η: F → G be a morphism of sheaves. Then show η is an epimorphism if and only if for all x in X, η_x are surjective on stalks.\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n- X is a topological space.\n- F and G are sheaves of sets on X.\n- η: F → G is a morphism of sheaves.\n- The category is sheaves of sets on X (since epimorphism is in this category).\n\nThus, each of these should be listed as separate assumptions. Each line addresses one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\n$X$ is a topological space,\n$F$ is a sheaf of sets on $X$,\n$G$ is a sheaf of sets on $X$,\n$\\eta$ is a morphism of sheaves from $F$ to $G$,\nthe category under consideration is the category of sheaves of sets on $X$.\n\nProblem: Prove that $\\eta$ is an epimorphism if and only if for all $x \\in X$, the induced maps on stalks $\\eta_{x}: F_x \\rightarrow G_x$ are surjective.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumptions included specific conditions (like n divisible by 7), but here the assumptions are more general. However, in the problem presented, there are no specific conditions beyond the setup. The original problem doesn't add any extra conditions; it's a general statement about sheaves. So the assumptions are just the setup. So yes, that's correct.\n\nThe user also mentioned comments about Hartshorne's proof for isomorphisms, but those are part of the question's context, not assumptions of the problem itself. The actual problem to be formatted is the equivalence between epimorphism and stalk surjectivity. The rest of the text is the user's thoughts and comments, which should be filtered out as per the instructions.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\nAssumptions:\n- X is a topological space.\n- F is a sheaf of sets on X.\n- G is a sheaf of sets on X.\n- η is a morphism from F to G.\n- The category is sheaves of sets on X.\n\nProblem: Prove that η is an epimorphism in this category if and only if for every x in X, the stalk maps η_x are surjective.\n\nEach assumption is on a separate line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. So that's the structure.",
