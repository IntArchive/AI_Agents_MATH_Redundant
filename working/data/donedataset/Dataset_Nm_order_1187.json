    "AcceptedAnswer": "Fix $a\\in \\mathbb{R}.$ Then $\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle\\lim_{x \\rightarrow a} f(x) &= \\displaystyle\\lim_{x \\rightarrow x_0} f(x - x_0 + a)\\\\ &= \\displaystyle\\lim_{x \\rightarrow x_0} \\left[f(x) - f(x_0) + f(a)\\right]\\\\& = \\left(\\displaystyle\\lim_{x \\rightarrow x_0} f(x)\\right) - f(x_0) + f(a)\\\\ & = f(x_0) -f(x_0) + f(a)\\\\ & = f(a).\n\\end{align*}$ It follows $f$ is continuous at $a.$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, the question is about proving that an additive function f, which is continuous at a single point x₀, is actually continuous everywhere. Hmm, additive functions... right, those are functions that satisfy f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) for all x and y. I remember that additive functions are linear if they're continuous, but here we just have continuity at one point.\n\nFirst, let me recall what's given. The function f: ℝ → ℝ is additive, meaning f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) for all real numbers x and y. Also, f is continuous at some point x₀. The goal is to show that f is continuous at every point x in ℝ.\n\nWait, additive functions have some properties. For example, f(0) should be 0 because f(0) = f(0 + 0) = f(0) + f(0), so subtracting f(0) from both sides gives f(0) = 0. Also, f(nx) = nf(x) for integers n, right? That's from induction. And by extension, for rational numbers q, f(qx) = qf(x). But without continuity, these functions can be weird, like pathological solutions to Cauchy's functional equation. But here, we have continuity at a single point, which might be enough to impose regularity everywhere.\n\nSo, how to use continuity at x₀ to get continuity elsewhere? Let's think. Suppose f is continuous at x₀. Then, for any sequence hₙ → 0, f(x₀ + hₙ) → f(x₀). But f(x₀ + hₙ) = f(x₀) + f(hₙ) by additivity. So, this implies that f(hₙ) → 0 as hₙ → 0. Wait, that's interesting. If we can show that f is continuous at 0, then maybe we can get continuity everywhere.\n\nBecause if f is continuous at 0, then for any x, continuity at x would follow since f(x + h) - f(x) = f(h), and if h → 0, then f(h) → 0. So, if f is continuous at 0, then it's continuous everywhere. So, maybe the key is to show that continuity at x₀ implies continuity at 0.\n\nBut how? Let's see. Since f is continuous at x₀, then for any sequence hₙ → 0, f(x₀ + hₙ) → f(x₀). But f(x₀ + hₙ) = f(x₀) + f(hₙ). Therefore, f(hₙ) → 0 as hₙ → 0. That's exactly the definition of continuity at 0. Because to check continuity at 0, we take hₙ → 0 and show f(hₙ) → f(0) = 0. So, if f is continuous at x₀, then it's continuous at 0. Then, once we have continuity at 0, as I thought earlier, additive functions with continuity at 0 are continuous everywhere.\n\nLet me verify this step again. Suppose hₙ → 0. Then, f(x₀ + hₙ) → f(x₀). But since f(x₀ + hₙ) = f(x₀) + f(hₙ), then f(hₙ) = f(x₀ + hₙ) - f(x₀) → f(x₀) - f(x₀) = 0. Therefore, f is continuous at 0. Then, for any point x, take a sequence hₙ → 0. Then, f(x + hₙ) = f(x) + f(hₙ) → f(x) + 0 = f(x). So, f is continuous at x. Therefore, f is continuous everywhere.\n\nSo, the main steps are:\n\n1. Use continuity at x₀ to show continuity at 0.\n2. Use continuity at 0 to show continuity everywhere.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to these two steps, and the key insight is that additivity allows translating the point of continuity from x₀ to 0, and then from 0 to any x.\n\nI need to make sure there are no gaps here. Let's consider if there's any assumption missing. The problem states that f is additive and continuous at a single point x₀. We didn't assume anything else, like f being linear or measurable. The additivity is crucial here because it allows the algebraic manipulation to move the point of continuity.\n\nAnother way to approach: For any x, to show f is continuous at x, take a sequence hₙ → 0. Then, f(x + hₙ) - f(x) = f(hₙ). If we can show f(hₙ) → 0, then we're done. But how does continuity at x₀ help here?\n\nAlternatively, let me express hₙ as (x₀ + hₙ) - x₀. So, hₙ = (x₀ + hₙ) - x₀. Then, f(hₙ) = f(x₀ + hₙ) - f(x₀). Since x₀ + hₙ → x₀ as hₙ → 0, and f is continuous at x₀, then f(x₀ + hₙ) → f(x₀), so f(hₙ) = f(x₀ + hₙ) - f(x₀) → 0. Therefore, continuity at x₀ gives that f(hₙ) → 0, hence f is continuous at 0. Then, as before, continuity at 0 gives continuity everywhere.\n\nYes, that seems solid. So the key idea is translating the point of continuity via additivity to 0, then leveraging that for all other points.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list the assumptions:\n\nAssumption: f is additive (f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) for all x, y),\nAssumption: f is continuous at a single point x₀.\n\nProblem: Prove that f is continuous for all x.\n\nWait, in the original question, the user wrote \"f is continuous if it is continuous at a single point\". So, the problem is to show that continuity at one point implies continuity everywhere, given that f is additive. So, the assumptions are the additivity and continuity at a point. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: f is additive (i.e., f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) for all x, y),\nAssumption: f is continuous at a single point x₀.\n\nProblem: Prove that f is continuous at every x.\n\nYes, that's correct. Each assumption is on one line, addressing one property. The first is the additivity of f, the second is continuity at a point. Then the problem is to prove continuity everywhere.",
