    "AcceptedAnswer": "If a collection of columns are linearly independent (respectively\nlinearly dependent) then they remain so under elementary row\noperations. Therefore elementary row operations do not change the largest\nset of linearly independent columns. To see this, notice that a linear dependence relation between some\ncolumns of a matrix $A$ is given by a nonzero column vector $v$ with $Av=0$.\nIf $E$ is an elementary matrix and $B=EA$ then $Bv=EAv=0$; conversely\nif $Bv=0$ then $Av=E^{-1}Bv=0$. Therefore if a set of columns\nof $A$ is linearly dependent then the corresponding set of columns\nof $B$ is also linearly dependent and vice versa . This means $A$ and $B$\nhave the same column rank.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let me try to tackle this problem. The user is asking why row operations don't change the column rank, even though they do alter the column space. Hmm. First, I need to recall what column rank means—it's the maximum number of linearly independent columns in a matrix. Row operations include things like swapping rows, multiplying a row by a scalar, and adding a multiple of one row to another. \n\nWait, the user mentioned that row operations change the column space. That makes sense because each column is a vector in the row space, and changing the rows would affect the components of these column vectors. But if the column space is changing, how come the column rank remains the same? That seems contradictory at first glance. Maybe the key here is that while the specific column vectors change, their linear independence isn't affected? Or perhaps there's a relationship between row and column operations that preserves rank.\n\nI remember that row rank equals column rank, which is a fundamental theorem in linear algebra. The user is trying to prove this, and they need to confirm that row operations don't alter the column rank. So, maybe the idea is that row operations preserve the row rank, and since row rank equals column rank, the column rank must also be preserved. But that feels circular because the theorem's proof often relies on this property. Let me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, consider that row operations are equivalent to multiplying by elementary matrices on the left. These elementary matrices are invertible. So, if we have a matrix A, and we perform row operations to get EA, where E is an invertible matrix, then the column space of EA is the image of the column space of A under E. Since E is invertible, it's an isomorphism, so it preserves linear independence. Therefore, the column rank (dimension of the column space) should remain the same. \n\nWait, but does multiplying by an invertible matrix really preserve the column rank? If E is invertible, then the rank of EA is the same as the rank of A. Because multiplying by an invertible matrix doesn't change the rank. So, column rank of EA equals column rank of A. That seems right. So, since row operations correspond to multiplication by invertible matrices, they preserve the column rank. \n\nBut the user's confusion is that row operations do change the column space. However, even though the column space changes, its dimension (the rank) remains the same. So, the actual vectors in the column space are different, but the maximum number of linearly independent columns doesn't change. \n\nAnother angle: Let's say we perform a row operation. For example, adding a multiple of one row to another. Suppose columns in the original matrix were linearly independent. After the row operation, do they remain linearly independent? If a set of columns was independent before, then after the row operation, their images under the elementary matrix (row operation) should still be independent because the operation is invertible. Similarly, if they were dependent, they stay dependent. Thus, the column rank is preserved. \n\nThis makes sense. So, the key point is that row operations are represented by invertible linear transformations (elementary matrices), which preserve linear independence and the dimension of the column space. Therefore, even though the specific column vectors change, their rank doesn't. \n\nSo, structuring the problem according to the required format, the assumption here is that we're dealing with row operations (like subtraction and permutation), and the problem is to explain or prove that these operations don't change the column rank. The original problem mentions that the user wants to confirm this statement to prove that row rank equals column rank. However, the assumptions should list the conditions given. Since the problem is more about understanding why row operations don't affect column rank, maybe the main assumption is that row operations are performed on a matrix, but the problem is to show that column rank remains unchanged. However, the example provided in the initial prompt includes specific assumptions about the objects in the problem. \n\nLooking back at the example: The original problem was about proving divisibility, and the formatted assumptions listed that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the question is about row operations and column rank. The assumptions could be that row operations (like subtraction and permutation) are applied to a matrix, but the problem is to prove that these operations do not change the column rank. However, the original question doesn't specify any particular conditions on the matrix—it's a general question. So perhaps the assumption is simply that we are performing row operations on a matrix. But the example had specific conditions. Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Let me check the original question again.\n\nOriginal question: \"Why do row operations not change the column rank? From this question link, I got to know that row operation (row subtraction and row permutation) do change column space. But still it seems that it does not change the column rank. I am trying to prove that row rank == columns rank, but for that I need confirm the statement above.\"\n\nSo the user is asking for an explanation or proof that row operations (specifically subtraction and permutation) do not change the column rank. The problem is to show that despite changing the column space, the column rank remains the same. Therefore, the assumptions would be the operations being row operations (subtraction and permutation), and the problem is to prove that column rank is unchanged. However, in the example, assumptions were about the variables in the problem. Here, the problem is more about operations on a matrix. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption: Row operations are performed on a matrix,\nRow operations include row subtraction and row permutation,\nProblem: Prove that column rank remains unchanged after row operations.\n\nBut the user's note says \"filtered the unrelated information and structure the problem as the following format.\" The example given in the original prompt had the assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But in this case, the problem is more general. Maybe the assumptions here are that row operations do not change the column rank, and the problem is to explain why. Wait, no, the problem is to prove that row operations do not change column rank. So the assumptions would be the conditions under which this holds. Since the user is referring to general matrices and row operations, perhaps there are no specific assumptions beyond the context of linear algebra (like the matrix is over a field, etc.), but maybe the problem is as stated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the key assumption is that row operations do not change the row rank, but the problem is to show they also don't change the column rank. However, the user is trying to prove row rank equals column rank, so that might not be an assumption here. \n\nAlternatively, since the user is working towards proving row rank equals column rank, and in that proof, they need to establish that row operations don't affect column rank. Therefore, the problem is standalone: given that we perform row operations, show that column rank doesn't change. The assumptions would be the row operations themselves. \n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about the variable n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, perhaps the assumptions are that we have a matrix, and we perform row operations (subtraction and permutation), and the problem is to prove that the column rank remains the same. \n\nSo structured as:\n\nAssumption: Row operations include row subtraction and row permutation,\nRow operations are applied to a matrix,\nProblem: Prove that column rank remains unchanged after row operations.\n\nBut in the example, each assumption is a single condition applied to one object. So here, each row operation type could be an assumption, but perhaps the user is combining them. Alternatively:\n\nAssumption: Row subtraction is performed on a matrix,\nRow permutation is performed on a matrix,\nProblem: Prove that column rank remains unchanged.\n\nBut maybe the problem is more general. The user says \"row operations not change the column rank,\" so the problem is to prove that, and the assumptions are the types of row operations. However, the user refers to row operations in general. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption: Row operations are performed on a matrix,\nProblem: Prove that column rank remains unchanged.\n\nBut the example had two assumptions. Maybe the key is that row operations include elementary operations (subtraction, permutation, etc.), and each could be an assumption. But I think in this case, the main assumption is just that row operations are performed. The problem is to prove they don't change column rank.\n\nBut the user's example included specific assumptions related to the problem. Here, the original question is more general. Perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption: The column space of a matrix is changed by row operations,\nThe column rank is the dimension of the column space,\nProblem: Prove that row operations do not change the column rank.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me see. The user's question is: Why do row operations not change the column rank? The note mentions that row operations do change the column space but not the column rank. So the assumptions might be that row operations alter the column space, but the problem is to show they don't alter its dimension (the rank). Therefore:\n\nAssumption: Row operations change the column space of a matrix,\nProblem: Prove that the column rank remains unchanged despite row operations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are the specific row operations mentioned: subtraction and permutation.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about the variable n. Here, the equivalent would be about the matrix and operations. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption: Row subtraction is applied to a matrix,\nRow permutation is applied to a matrix,\nProblem: Prove that column rank remains unchanged.\n\nBut in the original problem, the user is referring to both row subtraction and permutation as the operations in question. So each operation could be an assumption, but they are both part of row operations. So maybe:\n\nAssumption: Row operations include subtraction and permutation,\nProblem: Prove that column rank is unchanged by row operations.\n\nAlternatively, since the user wants to structure the problem by filtering unrelated information, the main assumptions are that we are dealing with row operations and the problem is to show column rank invariance. The original question's context is about proving row rank equals column rank, but the formatted problem should focus on the specific sub-problem: why row operations don't change column rank.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption: Row operations are performed on a matrix,\nProblem: Prove that column rank remains unchanged after row operations.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were two separate lines. Maybe here:\n\nAssumption: A matrix undergoes row operations,\nRow operations include subtraction and permutation,\nProblem: Prove that the column rank of the matrix remains unchanged.\n\nBut I need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption: Row operations are applied to a matrix,\nRow operations include row subtraction,\nRow operations include row permutation,\nProblem: Prove that the column rank of the matrix remains unchanged.\n\nBut perhaps the row operations being row subtraction and permutation are two separate assumptions. However, the problem is to prove that any row operation (including these two) doesn't change the column rank. Alternatively, the user might have mentioned these two operations specifically, so each is an assumption.\n\nYes, the user wrote: \"row operation (row subtraction and row permutation) do change column space. But still it seems that it does not change the column rank.\" So they are specifically talking about these two operations. Therefore, the assumptions would be that these operations are performed, and the problem is to prove that column rank doesn't change.\n\nSo formatted:\n\nAssumption: Row subtraction is performed on a matrix,\nRow permutation is performed on a matrix,\nProblem: Prove that the column rank of the matrix remains unchanged.\n\nBut wait, the original question says \"row operations not change the column rank\" in general, but the user is referring to row subtraction and permutation specifically. However, row operations also include scaling a row by a non-zero scalar. But maybe in this context, the user is considering these two operations. Alternatively, the problem might be more general, but the user mentions these two.\n\nBut to follow the example, each assumption is one line, one condition. So:\n\nAssumption: Row operations are performed on a matrix,\nRow operations include row subtraction and row permutation,\nProblem: Prove that the column rank remains unchanged.\n\nBut perhaps separating the operations:\n\nAssumption: Row subtraction is applied to a matrix,\nRow permutation is applied to a matrix,\nProblem: Prove that the column rank remains unchanged.\n\nHowever, the problem is to show that any row operation (including subtraction and permutation) doesn't change column rank. The user's question is more general but mentions these two operations. Maybe the correct way is to list the operations as separate assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is about any row operation, then:\n\nAssumption: Elementary row operations are performed on a matrix,\nProblem: Prove that the column rank remains unchanged.\n\nBut the user specifies row subtraction and permutation. Considering that, the formatted problem should reflect those specific operations mentioned.
