    "Content": "I tried to solve this question but things got too much complicated and hence my efforts were completely futile.

    "AcceptedAnswer": "We have\n$$0 \\leq F(\\theta) + F(\\theta + \\pi) = 2 - 2(A \\cos 2\\theta + B \\sin 2\\theta).$$ Let $u$ be the vector $(A,B)$. Pick $\\theta$ so that $v = (\\cos 2\\theta,  \\sin 2\\theta)$ is a unit vector in the same direction as $u$. Then $$\\sqrt{A^2 + B^2} = |u| = u \\cdot v = A \\cos 2\\theta + B \\sin 2\\theta \\leq 1.$$ For the second part, write\n$$0 \\leq F(\\theta) + F(\\theta + \\pi/2) = 2 - (b + a)\\cos \\theta - (b- a)\\sin \\theta.$$ Now pick $\\theta$ so that $v = (\\cos \\theta,\\sin \\theta)$ is a unit vector in the same direction as $u = (b + a,b - a)$.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions in the problem. The original question states that F(θ) ≥ 0 for all θ, where F(θ) is defined as 1 - a cosθ - b sinθ - A cos2θ - B sin2θ. The goal is to prove that a² + b² ≤ 2 and A² + B² ≤ 1.\n\nSo, the key assumptions here are that F(θ) is non-negative for every real number θ. Each trigonometric term involves different coefficients (a, b for the first harmonics and A, B for the second harmonics). The problem requires establishing bounds on the sums of the squares of these coefficients. \n\nI need to list each assumption line by line, ensuring each addresses one property or condition applied to one object. The main condition is the inequality holding for all θ, which applies to the function F(θ). However, the coefficients a, b, A, B are real numbers, and their relationship is derived from this inequality. \n\nWait, but in the example provided, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions would be that F(θ) is non-negative for all θ, and the variables a, b, A, B are real numbers. However, the problem statement might not explicitly mention that a, A, b, B are real, but the user's question does state \"Let a,A,b,B ∈ ℝ\", so that's an important assumption. \n\nSo breaking it down:\n\nAssumption 1: a, A, b, B are real numbers.\nAssumption 2: F(θ) = 1 - a cosθ - b sinθ - A cos2θ - B sin2θ is greater than or equal to 0 for all θ.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The problem then is to prove the two inequalities on the coefficients. Therefore, the formatted problem should list these assumptions and then state the problem as proving a² + b² ≤ 2 and A² + B² ≤ 1.\n\nI need to check if there are more assumptions. The original problem doesn't state any other conditions, like specific ranges for θ or relationships between the coefficients beyond what's given. So the two assumptions should suffice. \n\nThus, the final formatted problem should look like:\n\nAssumption:\na, A, b, B are real numbers,\nF(θ) ≥ 0 for all θ.\nProblem:\nProve that a² + b² ≤ 2 and A² + B² ≤ 1.\n\nYes, that seems to fit the required structure. Each assumption is on a separate line, addressing one condition each. The first line specifies the variables are real, which is crucial because the problem involves norms (sums of squares), and the second line states the given inequality for all θ. The problem then asks to prove the two inequalities on the coefficients.",
