    "Content": "Prove convergence\\divergence of the series:\n$$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\dfrac {1\\cdot 3\\cdots (2n-1)} {2\\cdot 4\\cdots (2n)}$$ Here is what I have at the moment: Method I My first way uses a result that is related to Wallis product that we'll denote by $W_{n}$.  Also, we  may denote $\\dfrac {1\\cdot 3\\cdots (2n-1)} {2\\cdot 4\\cdots (2n)}$ by $P_{n}$. Having noted these and taking a large\nvalue of $n$ we get:\n$$(P_{n})^2 =\\frac{1}{W_{n} \\cdot (2n+1)}\\approx\\frac{2}{\\pi}\\cdot \\frac{1}{2n+1}$$\n$$P_{n}\\approx \\sqrt {\\frac{2}{\\pi}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2n+1}}$$ Further we have that:\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\sqrt {\\frac{2}{\\pi}} \\cdot \\frac{n}{\\sqrt{2n+1}} \\le \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} P_{n}$$ \nthat obviously shows us that the series diverges. Method II The second way is to resort to the powerful Kummer's Test and firstly proceed with the ratio test:\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{P_{n+1}}{P_{n}}=\\frac{2n+1}{2n+2}=1$$\nand according to the result, the ratio test is inconclusive. Now, we apply Kummer's test and get:\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{P_{n}}{P_{n+1}}n-(n+1)=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} -\\frac{n+1}{2n+1}=-\\frac{1}{2} \\le 0$$\nSince \n$$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n} \\longrightarrow \\infty$$\nour series diverges and we're done. On the site I've also found a related question with answers that can be applied for my question. \nSince I've already have some answers for my question you may regard it as a recreational one and if you have a nice proof to share I'd be glad to receive it. I like this question very much and want to make up a collection with nice proofs for it. Thanks.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. The user wants to prove whether the series ∑ₙ=1^∞ [1·3·…·(2n−1)]/[2·4·…·(2n)] converges or diverges. They mentioned using two methods: one related to the Wallis product and Kummer's Test. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the general term of the series is Pₙ = (1·3·5·…·(2n−1))/(2·4·6·…·2n). I recognize this as the product of the first n odd numbers divided by the product of the first n even numbers. That can be simplified or expressed in terms of factorials or double factorials. Let me think: the numerator is (2n)! divided by (2^n n!) because each term in the numerator is (2n)! divided by the product of even numbers. Wait, actually, the product of the first n odd numbers is (2n)!/(2^n n!) ). Let me check: for example, when n=1, numerator is 1, which is 2!/(2^1 1!) = 2/(2*1) = 1. For n=2, 1·3 = 3 = 4!/(2^2 2!) = 24/(4*2) = 3. So yes, numerator is (2n)!/(2^n n!). Denominator is product of even numbers, which is 2·4·…·2n = 2^n · n!. So Pₙ = [(2n)!/(2^n n!)] / [2^n n!] = (2n)! / (4^n (n!)^2). Hmm, which is the same as the central binomial coefficient over 4^n. The central binomial coefficient is (2n choose n) = (2n)!/(n!^2), so Pₙ = (2n choose n)/4^n. That simplifies to 1/(4^n) * (2n choose n). Interesting.\n\nAlternatively, this term is also known as the nth Catalan number divided by (n+1), but maybe that's not directly helpful here. Wait, no. The nth Catalan number is (1/(n+1))(2n choose n), so maybe not directly. But knowing that Pₙ = (2n choose n)/4^n is useful. Then, I remember that the central binomial coefficient has an asymptotic approximation. Using Stirling's formula: n! ≈ √(2πn)(n/e)^n. So (2n choose n) = (2n)!/(n!^2) ≈ [√(4πn)(2n/e)^{2n}]/[ (√(2πn)(n/e)^n )^2 ] = [√(4πn) (4n²/e²)^n ] / [2πn (n²/e²)^n ] = √(4πn) / (2πn) * (4^n) = (2√πn) / (2πn) *4^n = (1/√(πn)) *4^n. Therefore, (2n choose n)/4^n ≈ 1/√(πn). So Pₙ ≈ 1/√(πn). Therefore, the general term behaves like 1/√(πn), so the series is similar to ∑1/√n, which is a p-series with p=1/2 <1, hence diverges. That would align with the user's conclusion.\n\nBut the user used two methods. In Method I, they approximated (Pₙ)^2 ≈ (2/π)(1/(2n+1)) via the Wallis product. Then Pₙ ≈ sqrt(2/π)/sqrt(2n+1) ~ 1/sqrt(n), so the series diverges. In Method II, they used Kummer's test. The ratio test gave a limit of 1, so inconclusive. Then applying Kummer's test with the harmonic series, they found the limit to be -1/2, which is ≤0, so divergence.\n\nNow, the problem is to structure this according to the user's format. The user wants the assumptions and the problem. The original problem is to prove convergence or divergence of the series ∑ₙ=1^∞ Pₙ where Pₙ is defined as that product.\n\nLooking at the example, they listed assumptions. But in the original problem, there might be implicit assumptions. For example, in the example, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the original problem didn't have that. Wait, maybe the example was modified. Wait in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Hmm, maybe that was a mistake. Wait, no. Wait the example shows that the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, but that was not in the original problem. Wait that seems incorrect. Wait the original problem was to prove for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem added the assumption that n is divisible by 7, which would make the problem incorrect. Maybe that example was wrong. But regardless, the user's instruction is to filter unrelated information and structure the problem with assumptions.\n\nBut in the current problem, the series is from n=1 to infinity of Pₙ. Are there any assumptions? The problem as stated is just to prove convergence/divergence. So unless there are hidden assumptions, the assumptions might be minimal. For example, n is a positive integer. But since the series starts at n=1, that's given. So perhaps the assumption is just that n is a positive integer. Let's check the example again.\n\nWait in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", and the formatted problem added \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in their example. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should just be n is an integer. The fact that in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which would change the problem. So maybe that's an error. But since the user provided that example, perhaps the task is to structure the problem with any necessary assumptions, perhaps the ones that are implicit. But in the current problem, the series is ∑ₙ=1^∞ Pₙ. The only assumption here is that n is a positive integer. But maybe the user's format wants each assumption as a separate line. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the example, in the original problem, the user had \"for every integer n\", which in the formatted problem became \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. Then they added \"n is divisible by 7\" which was not in the original problem. That suggests that perhaps in that example, the user made an error. But perhaps the instruction is to filter the original problem and list the assumptions. If the problem is to prove convergence/divergence of the series, the assumptions are:\n\n- The series is ∑ₙ=1^∞ [1·3·…·(2n−1)]/[2·4·…·(2n)]\n\n- Each term of the series is defined as Pₙ = [1·3·…·(2n−1)]/[2·4·…·(2n)]\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions should be properties or conditions applied to one object. For example, in the example, the assumptions were about n. So here, perhaps the assumptions are that n is a positive integer, and that the terms Pₙ are as defined. But since the problem statement defines Pₙ, maybe it's not necessary to list it as an assumption. Alternatively, the problem is to analyze the series with the given terms, so the assumption is that the series is as defined. But the example lists assumptions about the variables. So maybe the key is to list any conditions on the variables. Since the series is from n=1 to infinity, the assumption is that n is a positive integer. So that's one assumption.\n\nBut the example had two assumptions, even though the original problem only stated \"for every integer n\". So in the example, they listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", which seems to restrict the problem. However, that might have been a mistake. But perhaps the user's example was incorrect. But regardless, following the user's instruction, the task is to list the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nIn the current problem, the problem is to prove convergence/divergence of the series ∑ₙ=1^∞ Pₙ where Pₙ is defined as that product. The problem is as stated. The only assumption here is that n is a positive integer, because the series starts at n=1 and goes to infinity. So that's one assumption. However, in the problem statement, it's already part of the series notation ∑ₙ=1^∞, so maybe n being a positive integer is given, and hence doesn't need to be listed as an assumption. Alternatively, maybe there are no specific assumptions beyond the problem as stated. The example seems to have added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem, but maybe that was a mistake.\n\nWait, the original example's problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", which would actually make the problem weaker. That seems incorrect. Perhaps there was a misunderstanding in the example. Maybe the user intended to show that even if the original problem had some conditions, but the example is not well-structured. So perhaps in the current problem, since there's no hidden assumption, the assumption section is empty. But the user's format requires listing assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem's assumptions are the general conditions needed for the series to be defined. For instance, each term Pₙ is defined for n ≥1. But since the series starts at n=1, and the terms are clearly defined for all n≥1, there are no additional assumptions. Therefore, perhaps the assumption section is empty. But the user's example included assumptions even when the original problem didn't have them. So maybe the user's example was flawed, but following their format, we need to list the assumptions.\n\nLooking back, the example had:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should be \"n is an integer\". The addition of \"n is divisible by 7\" is incorrect. So perhaps the example is wrong. But regardless, the user's instruction is to follow their format. In the current problem, the series is defined for n starting at 1, so the assumption would be that n is a positive integer. Additionally, each term Pₙ is as defined. But according to the example, assumptions are about the variables in the problem. So in this case, the assumption is:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n\nBut since the series is from n=1 to infinity, that's inherent in the problem statement, so maybe it's redundant. However, following the example's structure, even if redundant, list it. So the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve convergence/divergence of the series:\n$$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\dfrac {1\\cdot 3\\cdots (2n-1)} {2\\cdot 4\\cdots (2n)}$$\n\nBut wait, the original problem already states the series from n=1 to infinity, so the assumption that n is a positive integer is already given. Therefore, maybe there are no additional assumptions. But the user's example included an assumption even when the original problem stated \"for every integer n\". So perhaps in their format, we need to list the domain of the variable, even if it's part of the problem statement. So here, since the series is ∑ₙ=1^∞, n starts at 1 and is an integer. Hence, the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is an integer.\n\n- n ≥ 1.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption addresses only one property or condition applied to one object. So \"n is an integer\" and \"n ≥ 1\". But in the example, they had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So maybe even if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", they list \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, and then add any other conditions. But in the current problem, there are no other conditions besides n being a positive integer. So the assumptions are:\n\n- n is an integer.\n\n- n ≥ 1.\n\nBut the series notation ∑ₙ=1^∞ already implies that n starts at 1 and increments by 1 (integer). So perhaps in the user's format, we need to list these as assumptions. Hence:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn ≥ 1.\n\nProblem:\nProve convergence or divergence of the series $$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\dfrac {1\\cdot 3\\cdots (2n-1)} {2\\cdot 4\\cdots (2n)}.$$\n\nAlternatively, since the problem statement already includes the series from n=1 to infinity, maybe the assumptions are redundant. But following the example provided by the user, even if redundant, list them. So in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which became an assumption \"n is an integer\". Here, the problem is about the series from n=1 to infinity, which implies n is a positive integer. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n\nBut to break it into two lines as per the example's format (each line one condition):\n\n- n is an integer,\n\n- n ≥ 1.\n\nThat's two assumptions.\n\nHence, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn ≥ 1.\n\nProblem:\nProve convergence or divergence of the series $$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\dfrac {1\\cdot 3\\cdots (2n-1)} {2\\cdot 4\\cdots (2n)}.$$\n\nBut wait, the original problem didn't specify to separate into two assumptions, but according to the user's example, each assumption is one line. So in the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are separate. Hence, here, we should list \"n is an integer\" and \"n ≥ 1\" as two separate assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem is:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nn is an integer,\nn ≥ 1.\nProblem: \nProve convergence or divergence of the series:\n$$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\dfrac {1\\cdot 3\\cdots (2n-1)} {2\\cdot 4\\cdots (2n)}.$$\n###",
