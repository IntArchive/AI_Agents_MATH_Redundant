    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given question from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The example provided shows that the assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then the problem statement follows.\n\nFirst, let's look at the original question:\n\nTitle: Improved intermediate value theorem\nQuestion: Suppose f: [a,b] → ℝ is a continuous function with f(a) < 0, f(b) > 0. Can it be proved that there exists s₁ ≤ s₂ and ε > 0 such that f(s) = 0 for all s ∈ [s₁, s₂], while f(s) < 0 for all s ∈ [s₁ - ε, s₁) and f(s) > 0 for all s ∈ (s₂, s₂ + ε]? If not, what about in the case that one assumes f is C¹, or smooth?\n\nSo, the task is to format this into the Assumption and Problem sections.\n\nFirst, extract the assumptions. The original problem states:\n\n1. f is defined on [a, b] → ℝ.\n2. f is continuous.\n3. f(a) < 0.\n4. f(b) > 0.\n\nThese are four separate assumptions. Each applies to one object (the function f) or to the endpoints a and b. Then, the problem is to prove the existence of s₁ ≤ s₂ and ε > 0 with the specified conditions on the intervals around s₁ and s₂.\n\nAdditionally, the question asks about the cases when f is C¹ or smooth. However, the example given in the user's instruction seems to handle different cases by modifying the assumptions. So, perhaps the differentiability conditions (C¹ or smooth) are additional assumptions for separate problems. But in the original question, the user is asking if the initial statement can be proved under the given assumptions (continuous), and if not, whether adding C¹ or smoothness would make it provable. \n\nBut the format example the user provided had the original problem with an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the original problem's conditions. So in this case, the initial problem has the assumptions of continuity, f(a) <0, f(b) >0. Then, there's a follow-up question about whether the same conclusion holds if f is C¹ or smooth. \n\nHowever, the format requires each problem to have its own assumptions and problem statement. But the user's example didn't include the follow-up questions. So perhaps in this case, the original problem is the first part, and the follow-up questions are separate. But the user's example only had one problem. So maybe the user wants the main problem as stated, with the initial assumptions, and then perhaps the additional cases (C¹ or smooth) as separate problems? But the example given by the user only formatted one problem. \n\nWait, looking at the example:\n\nOriginal problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91. The user's formatted problem listed the assumption as n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Then the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. But the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7. Wait, the original problem in the example says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like an error. Wait, no, perhaps the example was incorrect. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, in the example given:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem has assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Unless maybe the user intended to show an example where they filtered out some conditions. Wait, perhaps the original problem had a hidden assumption? Or maybe it's a mistake. But in any case, following the user's instruction, I have to structure the given problem into assumptions and problem statement.\n\nSo for the current question:\n\nOriginal assumptions:\n\n- f: [a,b] → ℝ\n- f is continuous\n- f(a) < 0\n- f(b) > 0\n\nProblem: Prove existence of s₁ ≤ s₂ and ε >0 such that f(s)=0 on [s₁,s₂], f(s) <0 on [s₁−ε, s₁), and f(s) >0 on (s₂, s₂+ε].\n\nThen, the follow-up: if not, what if f is C¹ or smooth?\n\nBut the user's format example only addresses one problem. The original question here is asking two things: first, can it be proved under continuity, and if not, what if we assume more regularity (C¹ or smooth). But in the example provided by the user, the formatted problem only addresses the main problem, and perhaps the extra conditions (like n divisible by 7) are part of the assumptions. However, in the current problem, the user is asking about different cases (continuous vs C¹ vs smooth). \n\nBut the user's instruction says: \"structure that problem as the following format\". The example given includes only one problem. So perhaps each case (continuous, C¹, smooth) is a separate problem. However, the original question is phrased as a single problem with follow-up questions. \n\nBut since the user's example didn't include such follow-ups, maybe the answer should list the main problem with the initial assumptions, and then the additional problems (C¹, smooth) as separate. But how to fit that into the format?\n\nLooking at the user's example, they took the original problem, which stated \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. That suggests perhaps the user made a mistake in their example, or perhaps they intended to show that sometimes assumptions need to be clarified. But given that, perhaps the correct approach is to list all the initial assumptions, and then the problem. However, in the current problem, the user is asking whether the statement can be proved under continuity, and if not, under C¹ or smoothness. \n\nSo perhaps the main problem is under continuity, and then the other cases are separate problems. But the user's format seems to handle one problem at a time. \n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer should be structured as follows:\n\nAssumption:\nf: [a,b] → ℝ is continuous,\nf(a) < 0,\nf(b) > 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exist s₁ ≤ s₂ and ε >0 such that f(s)=0 for all s ∈ [s₁,s₂], f(s) <0 for all s ∈ [s₁−ε, s₁), and f(s) >0 for all s ∈ (s₂, s₂+ε].\n\nThen, for the other cases, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nf: [a,b] → ℝ is C¹,\nf(a) < 0,\nf(b) > 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exist s₁ ≤ s₂ and ε >0 such that f(s)=0 for all s ∈ [s₁,s₂], f(s) <0 for all s ∈ [s₁−ε, s₁), and f(s) >0 for all s ∈ (s₂, s₂+ε].\n\nSimilarly for smooth. But the original question is asking if the first part can be proved (under continuity), and if not, what if we assume C¹ or smooth. So perhaps the formatted problem should include the initial case (continuous), and then the other cases as separate problems. However, the user's example didn't have multiple problems, just one. \n\nBut since the user's instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\", and given that the original question has multiple parts (the main question and the follow-up), perhaps each part is a separate problem with its own assumptions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer should list all possible assumptions and the problem as a single entry. But given the example, the user included multiple assumptions (n is integer, n divisible by 7) even though the original problem didn't specify divisibility by 7. Wait, that example seems incorrect. The original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Unless maybe there was a misunderstanding in the example. Maybe the original problem had a hidden condition, but the example provided by the user is flawed. \n\nIn any case, focusing on the current problem, the initial assumptions are:\n\n- f is defined on [a,b] → ℝ\n\n- f is continuous\n\n- f(a) <0\n\n- f(b) >0\n\nProblem: Prove existence of s1 ≤ s2 and ε >0 such that f(s)=0 on [s1,s2], and the sign conditions on the intervals around.\n\nThen, the follow-up is: If not possible under continuity, does it hold under C¹ or smoothness?\n\nBut the format requires to list assumptions and the problem. So for the main problem, list the initial assumptions. Then, the follow-up questions would be separate problems with additional assumptions (f is C1, f is smooth).\n\nThus, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf: [a,b] → ℝ,\nf is continuous,\nf(a) < 0,\nf(b) > 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exist s₁ ≤ s₂ and ε >0 such that f(s)=0 for all s ∈ [s₁,s₂], f(s) <0 for all s ∈ [s₁−ε, s₁), and f(s) >0 for all s ∈ (s₂, s₂+ε].\n\nThen, separately, if the user wants to include the C¹ and smooth cases:\n\nFor C¹:\n\nAssumption:\nf: [a,b] → ℝ,\nf is C¹,\nf(a) <0,\nf(b) >0.\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove the existence of s₁ ≤ s₂ and ε >0 such that f(s)=0 for all s ∈ [s₁,s₂], f(s) <0 for all s ∈ [s₁−ε, s₁), and f(s) >0 for all s ∈ (s₂, s₂+ε].\n\nSimilarly for smooth. But the original question is asking if the initial proof is possible, and if not, whether it's possible under C¹ or smoothness. So perhaps the problem statement should reflect that. However, the format requires the problem to be a statement to prove, not a question. The example's problem is \"Prove that...\". \n\nTherefore, perhaps for each case (continuous, C¹, smooth), we have separate problem entries. But the user's instruction says to structure \"the problem\" (singular) into the format. Since the original post is a single question with multiple parts, perhaps the answer should list each case as a separate problem with their respective assumptions. However, given the example provided by the user, which only formatted one problem, perhaps the intended answer is to list the main problem with the initial assumptions and then mention the other cases in the problem statement. But the format doesn't allow for multiple problems in one entry.\n\nAlternatively, the problem statement can include the follow-up questions as part of the problem. For example:\n\nProblem:\nCan it be proved that there exist s₁ ≤ s₂ and ε >0 such that f(s)=0 for all s ∈ [s₁,s₂], f(s) <0 for all s ∈ [s₁−ε, s₁), and f(s) >0 for all s ∈ (s₂, s₂+ε]? If not, what about when assuming f is C¹ or smooth?\n\nBut in the example, the problem is phrased as a statement to prove, not a question. The example's problem is \"Prove that...\". So perhaps the user wants the problem to be a command, not a question. Therefore, maybe rephrase the original question into a problem statement:\n\nOriginal question asks to prove existence under continuity, and if not, consider C¹ or smooth. But how to fit this into the format.\n\nPerhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nf: [a,b] → ℝ is continuous,\nf(a) <0,\nf(b) >0.\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that there exist s₁ ≤ s₂ and ε >0 such that f(s)=0 for all s ∈ [s₁,s₂], with f(s) <0 on [s₁−ε, s₁) and f(s) >0 on (s₂, s₂+ε].\n\nThen, the other cases would be additional problems with different assumptions. But since the user's example only had one problem, perhaps they expect each case (continuous, C¹, smooth) to be separate. However, the original question is all in one, so perhaps the answer should include all three cases as part of the problem statement. But the format example shows that the problem is a single statement. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is as stated, and the additional smoothness conditions are part of the problem's inquiry. However, the format requires the problem to be a statement. Given that, maybe the answer should structure the main problem under continuity, and then note the other cases in the problem statement. But how?\n\nIn the example, the problem was rephrased from the original to include an assumption that wasn't originally there (n divisible by 7). But that might be a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the example is incorrect, and the user intended to show that assumptions are extracted from the problem. For instance, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is \"n is an integer\", and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. But in the example, the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" which was not in the original, which is confusing. This might indicate that the user made a mistake in their example. \n\nAssuming that the example is correct and that sometimes assumptions need to be inferred, perhaps in the current problem, the main assumptions are continuity and the endpoint conditions. So, following that, the formatted problem should list those assumptions and the problem as stated. The follow-up about C¹ and smooth would be additional problems. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to \"structure that problem as the following format\", referring to the given example. The example took the original problem and formatted it with assumptions and problem. So perhaps, in this case, the answer should include the initial problem's assumptions and problem, and the follow-up as a separate entry. However, since the user's example only formatted one problem, maybe they expect only the main case (continuous) to be formatted here, and the other cases (C¹, smooth) to be omitted or mentioned in the problem statement. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but aiming to follow the example, I think the correct approach is to list the initial assumptions (continuous, f(a) <0, f(b) >0) and the problem as proving the existence of s₁, s₂, and ε. The follow-up about C¹ or smooth would be separate problems with modified assumptions, but since the user's example didn't handle multiple cases, perhaps they should be omitted or included in the problem statement. However, the original question is asking both, so maybe the problem statement should reflect that. \n\nBut in the example, the problem statement is a single command (\"Prove that...\"). So perhaps the answer should be:\n\nAssumption:\nf: [a,b] → ℝ is continuous,\nf(a) < 0,\nf(b) > 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve whether there exist s₁ ≤ s₂ and ε >0 such that f(s)=0 for all s ∈ [s₁,s₂], f(s) <0 for all s ∈ [s₁−ε, s₁), and f(s) >0 for all s ∈ (s₂, s₂+ε]. If not, determine if the conclusion holds when f is assumed to be C¹ or smooth.\n\nBut the example uses \"Prove that...\", so maybe the problem should be phrased as a command. However, the original question is asking whether it can be proved, so maybe rephrase to \"Prove or disprove...\" and then mention the other cases. Alternatively, since the example uses \"Prove\", maybe stick to that structure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer should be split into three separate problems:\n\n1. Continuous case\n2. C¹ case\n3. Smooth case\n\nBut the user's instruction shows a single problem. Given that, perhaps the answer should include only the main problem with the continuous assumptions, and the follow-up is considered a separate problem, but not included here. However, the original question explicitly asks about the other cases. \n\nGiven the confusion, but trying to follow the example as closely as possible, I will structure the main problem with the continuous assumptions and the problem as stated, and perhaps include the other cases in the problem statement. \n\nBut in the example, the problem was rephrased to include the assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was not in the original. That suggests that perhaps the user wants to extract all conditions from the problem statement, even if they are not explicitly listed. However, in the current problem, the assumptions are clearly stated: f is continuous, f(a) <0, f(b) >0. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is defined on the interval [a, b],\nf is continuous,\nf(a) < 0,\nf(b) > 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exist s₁ ≤ s₂ and ε >0 such that f(s)=0 for all s ∈ [s₁, s₂], f(s) <0 for all s ∈ [s₁−ε, s₁), and f(s) >0 for all s ∈ (s₂, s₂+ε].\n\nBut the original question is phrased as \"Can it be proved...\" which is a yes/no question, but the example rephrased it as a command (\"Prove that...\"). So following the example, the problem should be phrased as \"Prove that...\".\n\nHowever, the answer might be that it's not necessarily true under continuity, but true under C¹. Therefore, the problem as phrased would be incorrect. But since the user wants the problem structured as per the example, perhaps we have to present it as a command, regardless of its actual provability.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should list the assumptions and the problem as given, following the example's structure.",
