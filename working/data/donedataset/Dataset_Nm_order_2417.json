    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $Z_i$, $1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n$ be independent identically distributed normal variables with mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^2$, and let $Z_{k:n}$ denote $k$-th order statistics. We separately consider the case of even $n$  and odd $n$. Let $n$ be odd, i.e. $n = 2m+1$. Then the sample median corresponds to $M = Z_{m+1:2m+1}$. The probability density of this order statistics is:\n$$\n     f_{M}(x) = (m+1) \\binom{2m+1}{m} f_X(x) \\left( F_X(x) (1-F_X(x)) \\right)^m\n$$\nSince $F_X(x) = 1-F_X(2\\mu-x)$, we clearly get $f_M(x) = f_M(2\\mu -x)$ by symmetry, and therefore\n$$\n   \\mathbb{E}(M) = \\mathbb{E}(2 \\mu -M) \\implies  \\mathbb{E}(M) = \\mu\n$$ Now consider the case of even $n$, i.e. $n = 2m$. Then the sample median corresponds to \n$M = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( Z_{m:2m} + Z_{m+1:2m} \\right)$. The joint probability density is :\n$$\n    f_{Z_{m:2m}, Z_{m+1:2m}}(x_1,x_2) = m^2 \\binom{2m}{m}f_X(x_1) f_X(x_2) \\left(F_X(x_1) (1-F_X(x_2))\\right) ^{m-1} [ x_1 \\leqslant x_2 ]\n$$\nClearly, again $f_{Z_{m:2m}, Z_{m+1:2m}}(x_1,x_2)=f_{Z_{m:2m}, Z_{m+1:2m}}(2\\mu - x_2,2 \\mu - x_1)$ by symmetry, therefore\n$$\n   \\mathbb{E}(M) = \\mathbb{E}\\left( \\frac{ Z_{m:2m} + Z_{m+1:2m}}{2} \\right) = \n   \\mathbb{E}\\left( \\frac{ (2\\mu-Z_{m+1:2m}) + (2\\mu - Z_{m:2m})}{2} \\right) = \\mathbb{E}(2\\mu - M)\n$$\nThis again implies that $\\mathbb{E}(M) = \\mu$ as a consequence of the symmetry. Added : The normality assumption was not used in the above demonstration, thus the proof holds for any continuous random variable with symmetric probability density and finite mean.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given question from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The example provided shows that I need to list each assumption on a separate line, focusing on one property per line and one object each. Then, state the problem clearly.\n\nLooking at the original question: \"Prove that the sample median is an unbiased estimator of its mean, by virtue of the symmetry of normal distribution.\" The book mentioned uses the symmetry of the normal distribution to claim that the sample median is unbiased. The user is asking for a proof of this statement.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions here. The key points are:\n\n1. The underlying distribution is normal. That's a given because the problem states \"of a normal distribution.\"\n2. The sample median is being considered as an estimator. The problem is about the sample median, not the population median.\n3. The normal distribution is symmetric. The problem mentions symmetry as the reason for the unbiasedness.\n\nEach assumption should be a single line, addressing one property of one object. So, breaking it down:\n\n- The estimator in question is the sample median. So, the first assumption is about the estimator being the sample median.\n- The distribution is normal. That's another assumption.\n- The normal distribution is symmetric. Symmetry is a property of the distribution, so that's a separate assumption.\n\nWait, but in the example provided, the user included two assumptions: one about n being an integer and another about n being divisible by 7. However, in the original problem, the example had \"for every integer n\", but then the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, maybe that was part of the problem's actual conditions? Let me check. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like the user might have made a mistake. Wait, no, looking back, the original problem in the example is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem lists assumptions as n being integer and n divisible by 7. But the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7. Wait, that seems conflicting. Maybe there was an error in the example? Or perhaps the user intended to show that in the example, but the actual problem might have different conditions. Hmm, perhaps I should focus on the current problem at hand.\n\nBack to the current question. The problem is about proving that the sample median is an unbiased estimator of the mean of a normal distribution. The key assumptions here are:\n\n1. The sample is drawn from a normal distribution. (This is given in the problem statement.)\n2. The normal distribution is symmetric about its mean. (Since symmetry is the reason cited for the unbiasedness.)\n3. The estimator in question is the sample median. (The problem is about the sample median being unbiased.)\n\nBut wait, the symmetry of the normal distribution is inherent in its definition. A normal distribution is always symmetric about its mean. So maybe the assumption is that the distribution is normal, which implies symmetry. However, the problem explicitly mentions \"by virtue of the symmetry of normal distribution,\" so maybe the assumption should list both that the distribution is normal and that it's symmetric. But since symmetry is a property of the normal distribution, perhaps it's redundant. However, the problem's reasoning relies on the symmetry, so maybe it's better to state both to make it explicit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants the assumptions to be that the distribution is symmetric (since the problem says \"by virtue of the symmetry\") and that it's normal. Wait, but normal is a specific case of a symmetric distribution. Hmm. Maybe the problem is generalizable to any symmetric distribution, but the book's statement is specifically for normal. So in the problem as posed, the assumptions are:\n\n- The sample is from a normal distribution.\n\nBut since the book's argument uses symmetry, which is a property of the normal distribution, maybe the assumptions are:\n\n1. The underlying distribution is normal.\n2. The normal distribution is symmetric about its mean.\n\nBut perhaps that's redundant because the first implies the second. However, since the problem mentions the symmetry as the reason, maybe it's better to list both.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem's assumptions are:\n\n- The sample median is calculated from a random sample.\n- The random sample is drawn from a normal distribution.\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't mention sample size. Wait, the sample median's unbiasedness might depend on the sample size. For example, for even sample sizes, the median is the average of the two middle values, whereas for odd, it's the middle one. So maybe the problem has an implicit assumption about the sample size, but the original question doesn't specify. The original question just says \"sample median\", without specifying. However, the user's book says that the sample median is unbiased, which might be generally true for any sample size under normality. But in reality, for the normal distribution, the sample median is indeed unbiased for the mean, regardless of sample size, due to symmetry. However, maybe the problem assumes that the sample size is odd? Wait, no, because even for even sample sizes, the median is still an unbiased estimator. Wait, actually, for symmetric distributions, the median is unbiased. But maybe there's a nuance here. For example, in symmetric distributions, the expected value of the median equals the mean. But does that hold for all sample sizes? Let me think. Suppose we have a sample of size n from a symmetric distribution. Then the distribution of the sample median is also symmetric around the population mean, so the expectation of the sample median would be the population mean. Therefore, regardless of sample size, as long as the distribution is symmetric, the sample median is unbiased. Therefore, the key assumptions are:\n\n1. The sample is drawn from a normal distribution (which is symmetric about its mean).\n2. The sample median is used as the estimator.\n\nBut the problem statement in the original question is about the normal distribution specifically, so maybe the main assumption is that the distribution is normal, which implies symmetry. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe underlying distribution is normal,\nThe sample median is the estimator of the mean.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the sample median is an unbiased estimator of the mean.\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"by virtue of the symmetry of normal distribution\". So maybe the symmetry is an explicit part of the reasoning. Therefore, the assumptions should include that the distribution is symmetric. However, since the normal distribution is inherently symmetric, maybe it's redundant. But the problem's reasoning is based on symmetry, so perhaps it's better to include both. Alternatively, perhaps the problem's key points are:\n\nAssumptions:\nThe random sample is drawn from a normal distribution,\nThe normal distribution is symmetric about its mean,\nThe estimator considered is the sample median.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the sample median is an unbiased estimator of the mean.\n\nBut I need to check the example provided again. In the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem listed assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption that n is an integer is correct. However, the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original problem. That seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect? Because the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 (which is 7×13). If n is any integer, then A(n) is divisible by 91. But perhaps in the formatted problem, the user mistakenly added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which might not be correct. Maybe the example is flawed, but I should follow the user's instruction regardless.\n\nIn any case, the task is to filter unrelated information and structure the problem with assumptions and the problem statement. For the current problem:\n\nOriginal question states that the sample median of a normal distribution is an unbiased estimator of its mean due to symmetry. The user wants to prove this.\n\nAssumptions needed:\n\n1. The sample is drawn from a normal distribution. (Since the problem is about the normal distribution's median.)\n2. The normal distribution is symmetric about its mean. (Because the book's reasoning cites symmetry.)\n3. The estimator in question is the sample median. (Clarifies what is being proven.)\n\nAlternatively, since the normal distribution's symmetry is inherent, maybe just the first and third assumptions. But given the problem's mention of symmetry, it's safer to include it as a separate assumption.\n\nProblem statement: Prove that the sample median is an unbiased estimator of the mean.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nThe underlying distribution is normal,\nThe distribution is symmetric about its mean,\nThe estimator is the sample median.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the sample median is an unbiased estimator of the mean.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second assumption is redundant because the first implies it. But following the example where redundant assumptions might be listed, perhaps include both. However, in the example, the user included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem says \"for every integer n\". That might be an error in the example, but perhaps the user wants all relevant conditions listed as separate assumptions, even if some are implied by others.\n\nIn this case, since the problem mentions symmetry, even though it's a property of the normal distribution, listing it as a separate assumption would align with the example's structure. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe sample is drawn from a normal distribution,\nThe normal distribution is symmetric about its mean,\nThe estimator is the sample median.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the sample median is an unbiased estimator of the mean.\n\nI think that's the correct structure. Each assumption is a single property applied to one object.",
