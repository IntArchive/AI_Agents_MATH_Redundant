    "Content": "So while doing all sorts of proving and disproving statements regarding irrational numbers, I ran into this one and it quite stumped me: Prove that $\\sqrt[3]{2} + \\sqrt[3]{4}$ is irrational. I tried all the usual suspects like playing with $\\sqrt[3]{2} + \\sqrt[3]{4} = \\frac{a}{b}$ for $a,b\\in \\mathbb{Z}$ , but got nowhere. I also figured maybe I should play with it this way: $2^\\frac{1}{3} + 4^\\frac{1}{3}=2^\\frac{1}{3} + (2^2)^\\frac{1}{3}=2^\\frac{1}{3} + 2^\\frac{2}{3}=2^\\frac{1}{3} + 2^\\frac{1}{3}\\times 2^\\frac{1}{3}=2^\\frac{1}{3}(1+2^\\frac{1}{3})$ But there I got stumped again, because while $1+2^\\frac{1}{3}$ is irrational, nothing promises me that $2^\\frac{1}{3} \\times (1+2^\\frac{1}{3})$ is irrational, and I feel like trying to go further down this road is moot. So what am I missing (other than sleep and food)? What route should I take to \nprove this?\nThanks in advance!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Note $$1 + \\sqrt[3]{2} + \\sqrt[3]{4} = \\frac{(\\sqrt[3]{2})^3 - 1}{\\sqrt[3]{2} - 1} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{2} - 1}.$$ So if $\\sqrt[3]{2} + \\sqrt[3]{4}$ is rational, then $1/(\\sqrt[3]{2} - 1)$ is rational, which implies $\\sqrt[3]{2} - 1$ is rational.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that the sum of the cube roots of 2 and 4, specifically ∛2 + ∛4, is irrational. Hmm, first, I need to recall some strategies for proving irrationality. The common ones include proof by contradiction, using the rational root theorem, or showing that a number is algebraic of degree higher than one (since rational numbers are algebraic of degree 1).\n\nLet me start by simplifying the expression. Since ∛4 is the same as ∛(2²), which can be written as (∛2)². So, the expression becomes ∛2 + (∛2)². Let's denote x = ∛2. Then the expression is x + x². If we can show that x + x² is irrational, then we've proven the statement.\n\nBut wait, x itself is ∛2, which is irrational. However, the sum of two irrational numbers isn't necessarily irrational. For example, √2 + (-√2) = 0, which is rational. So, we can't just rely on the fact that x is irrational. We need a different approach.\n\nLet me try proof by contradiction. Assume that x + x² is rational. Let’s set y = x + x² = rational number, say q. Since x = ∛2, we know that x³ = 2. Let's see if we can express this in terms of y.\n\nFirst, let's compute y = x + x². Let me cube both sides to see if that helps. But cubing y directly might be messy. Alternatively, let's find a polynomial equation that y satisfies.\n\nGiven x³ = 2, we can express higher powers of x in terms of lower powers. Let's compute y² and y³ in terms of x.\n\nFirst, y = x + x².\n\nCompute y² = (x + x²)² = x² + 2x³ + x⁴. But x³ = 2, so x⁴ = x * x³ = x*2 = 2x. Therefore, y² = x² + 2*(2) + 2x = x² + 4 + 2x.\n\nBut we know that y = x + x², so x² = y - x. Substitute that into y²:\n\ny² = (y - x) + 4 + 2x = y - x + 4 + 2x = y + x + 4.\n\nSo, y² = y + x + 4. But we have x in terms of y: from y = x + x², we can write x = y - x². Wait, that might not be helpful. Alternatively, perhaps express x in terms of y.\n\nWait, let's rearrange the equation y² = y + x + 4. Let's solve for x:\n\nx = y² - y - 4.\n\nBut we also have x³ = 2. Substitute x from above into this equation:\n\n(y² - y - 4)³ = 2.\n\nExpanding this cubic equation would give a polynomial in y. If y is rational, then this equation must have a rational root. According to the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root p/q (in lowest terms) of the polynomial equation must satisfy that p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient.\n\nBut let's actually expand (y² - y - 4)³. Hmm, that's going to be tedious. Maybe there's a smarter way. Let me consider that if y is rational, then the minimal polynomial of y over the rationals must have degree 1, meaning y is rational. But maybe we can find the minimal polynomial of y and show that it has no rational roots.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that y = x + x², and x³ = 2. Let me find a polynomial equation for y. Let's compute:\n\nWe have y = x + x².\n\nLet me multiply both sides by x: yx = x² + x³. But x³ = 2, so yx = x² + 2.\n\nBut from y = x + x², we can write x² = y - x. Substitute into the above equation:\n\nyx = (y - x) + 2 => yx = y - x + 2.\n\nBring all terms to one side: yx - y + x - 2 = 0 => y(x - 1) + x - 2 = 0.\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Let's try another approach. Let's express y in terms of x, then eliminate x to get a polynomial in y.\n\nFrom y = x + x².\n\nLet me cube both sides:\n\ny³ = (x + x²)³ = x³ + 3x⁴ + 3x⁵ + x⁶.\n\nBut x³ = 2, so x⁴ = x * x³ = 2x, x⁵ = x² * x³ = 2x², and x⁶ = (x³)² = 4.\n\nSubstitute back:\n\ny³ = 2 + 3*(2x) + 3*(2x²) + 4 = 2 + 6x + 6x² + 4 = 6x + 6x² + 6.\n\nFactor out 6:\n\ny³ = 6(x + x²) + 6.\n\nBut x + x² = y, so:\n\ny³ = 6y + 6.\n\nTherefore, we have y³ - 6y - 6 = 0.\n\nSo the minimal polynomial for y is y³ - 6y - 6 = 0.\n\nNow, according to the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root of this polynomial must divide the constant term, which is -6. Therefore, possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6.\n\nLet's test these:\n\nFor y = 1: 1 - 6 - 6 = -11 ≠ 0\n\ny = -1: -1 + 6 -6 = -1 ≠ 0\n\ny = 2: 8 -12 -6 = -10 ≠ 0\n\ny = -2: -8 +12 -6 = -2 ≠ 0\n\ny = 3: 27 -18 -6 = 3 ≠ 0\n\ny = -3: -27 +18 -6 = -15 ≠ 0\n\ny = 6: 216 -36 -6 = 174 ≠ 0\n\ny = -6: -216 +36 -6 = -186 ≠ 0\n\nSo none of the possible rational roots satisfy the equation. Therefore, the polynomial y³ -6y -6 = 0 has no rational roots. Since y is a root of this polynomial, and it's irreducible over the rationals (as it has no rational roots and is cubic), then y is algebraic of degree 3 over the rationals. Hence, y must be irrational.\n\nTherefore, we've proven that ∛2 + ∛4 is irrational.\n\nWait, but let me check if the polynomial is indeed irreducible. Since we checked all possible rational roots and none work, and the polynomial is cubic, it can't factor into a linear and a quadratic term with integer coefficients. Therefore, it is irreducible over the rationals. Hence, the minimal polynomial is indeed degree 3, so y is irrational.\n\nSo, the key steps were:\n\n1. Let y = ∛2 + ∛4.\n\n2. Express y in terms of x = ∛2, so y = x + x².\n\n3. Derive a cubic equation for y using the fact that x³ = 2.\n\n4. Show that this cubic equation has no rational roots, implying y is irrational.\n\nTherefore, the problem is solved by constructing the minimal polynomial and applying the Rational Root Theorem.",
