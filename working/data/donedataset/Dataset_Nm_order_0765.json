    "Content": "Hi guys I am working with this and I am trying to prove to myself that n by n matrices of the type zero on the diagonal and 1 everywhere else are invertible. I ran some cases and looked at the determinant and came to the conclusion that we can easily find the determinant by using the following $\\det(A)=(-1)^{n+1}(n-1)$. To prove this I do induction n=2 we have the $A=\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 1\\\\ \n1 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}$ $\\det(A)=-1$ and my formula gives me the same thing (-1)(2-1)=-1 Now assume if for $n \\times n$ and $\\det(A)=(-1)^{n+1}(n-1)$ Now to show for  a matrix B of size $n+1 \\times n+1$. I am not sure I was thinking to take the determinant of the $n \\times n$ minors but I am maybe someone can help me. Also is there an easier way to see this is invertible other than the determinant? I am curious.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This is easy to calculate by row reduction: Add all rows to first:\n$$\\det(A) =\\det \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 1 &...&1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 1 &...&1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 &...&1 \\\\\n... & ... & ... &...&... \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 &...&0 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}=\\det \\begin{bmatrix}\nn-1 & n-1 & n-1 &...&n-1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 1 &...&1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 &...&1 \\\\\n... & ... & ... &...&... \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 &...&0 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n=(n-1)\\det \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 1 &...&1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 1 &...&1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 &...&1 \\\\\n... & ... & ... &...&... \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 &...&0 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}=(n-1)\\det \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 1 &...&1 \\\\\n0 & -1 & 0 &...&0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & -1 &...&0 \\\\\n... & ... & ... &...&... \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 &...&-1 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}$$ where in the last row operation I subtracted the first row from each other row. This shows \n$$\\det(A)=(n-1)(-1)^{n-1}$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to prove that an n×n matrix with zeros on the diagonal and ones everywhere else is invertible. They mentioned using induction on the determinant formula det(A) = (-1)^{n+1}(n-1), and they're looking for help with the induction step as well as alternative methods to show invertibility.\n\nFirst, let's parse the original question. The main goal is to prove invertibility of such matrices. The user attempted using determinant calculation and induction but got stuck on the inductive step for an (n+1)×(n+1) matrix. They also asked for other methods besides computing the determinant.\n\nThe assumptions here need to be listed clearly. The matrix in question has zeros on the diagonal and ones elsewhere. So each entry a_ii = 0 for i from 1 to n, and a_ij = 1 when i ≠ j. The problem is to prove this matrix is invertible, which can be approached via determinant non-zero or other means like finding an inverse directly or using properties like eigenvalues.\n\nIn the example provided, assumptions were split into single conditions per line. For this problem, the key assumptions are:\n\n1. The matrix is n×n.\n2. All diagonal entries are zero.\n3. All off-diagonal entries are one.\n\nThe problem statement then is to prove that such a matrix is invertible.\n\nWait, the user also mentioned their determinant formula. But in the problem structuring, the main problem is to prove invertibility, and the determinant approach is their attempt. However, the problem as stated is just to prove invertibility, so the determinant formula is part of their approach, not an assumption. Therefore, the assumptions should only include the structure of the matrix, not the determinant formula.\n\nSo, the Assumption section should list each property of the matrix: size n×n, zeros on the diagonal, ones elsewhere. Each of these as separate points.\n\nProblem statement: Prove that the matrix is invertible.\n\nAdditionally, the user is asking for alternative methods, but according to the task, the formatted problem should capture the core question. The alternative methods are part of the user's inquiry but not the main problem. The main problem is to prove invertibility, possibly via determinant or other means.\n\nSo, structured properly:\n\nAssumption:\nThe matrix is an n×n square matrix,\nEach diagonal entry of the matrix is 0,\nEach off-diagonal entry of the matrix is 1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the matrix is invertible.\n\nThe example given in the initial instruction included an assumption where n is divisible by 7, but in this problem, the user didn't specify any divisibility conditions. The matrix is general for any n. So the assumptions are purely about the structure of the matrix.\n\nChecking again the original question: The user says \"n by n matrices of the type zero on the diagonal and 1 everywhere else are invertible.\" So the problem is for any n, prove such matrices are invertible. The determinant formula they came up with is part of their attempt, but the core problem is to prove invertibility. Hence, the formatted problem should reflect that.",
