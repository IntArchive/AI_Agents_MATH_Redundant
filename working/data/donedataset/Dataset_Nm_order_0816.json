    "Content": "Let $f\\in C^{3}[0,1]$ such that $f(0)=f'(0)=f(1)=0$ and $\\big|f''' (x)\\big|\\le 1$ .Prove that $$\\left|30240\\int_{0}^{1}x(1-x)f(x)f'(x)dx\\right|\\le1 .$$ I couldn't make much progress on this problem. I thought that maybe I should try using polynomial interpolation since I have a bound for $|f'''|$ , but I can't determine the interpolation polynomial and I am quickly stuck (there is also the problem that I am dealing with both $f$ and $f'$ under the integral). Apart from this, I don't think that there is much we can do, the solution probably relies on this technique, but I can't make further progress.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "First, using integration by parts, and noting that $f(0)=f'(0)=0$ we get $$\nf(x)=\\frac{x^2}{2}f''(0)+\\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^x(x-t)^2f^{(3)}(t)dt\\tag{1}\n$$ And from $f(1)=0$ we get also $$\n0=f(1)=\\frac{1}{2}f''(0)+\\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^1(1-t)^2f^{(3)}(t)dt\n$$ Hence $$\\eqalign{\n0&=\\frac{x^2}{2}f''(0)+\n\\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^xx^2(1-t)^2f^{(3)}(t)dt\\cr\n&+\n\\frac{1}{2}\\int_x^1x^2(1-t)^2f^{(3)}(t)dt\n\\tag{2}}\n$$ Subtracting from $(1)$ from $(2)$ we get $$f(x)=-\\int_0^1k(x,t)f^{(3)}(t)dt\\tag{3}$$ with $$k(x,t)=\\cases{\\dfrac{x^2(1-t)^2-(x-t)^2}{2}& if $t\\leq x$\\cr\n\\dfrac{x^2(1-t)^2}{2}& if $ x\\leq t$\n}$$ (Note that $k(x,t)\\ge 0$ for $0\\leq x,t\\leq 1$ ). Now, we note that $$\\eqalign{I&=\\int_0^1x(1-x)f(x)f'(x)dx=\\int_0^1\\left(x-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)(f(x))^2dx\\\\\n&=\\int_0^1\\int_0^1\\int_0^1\\left(x-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)k(x,t)k(x,s)f^{(3)}(t)f^{(3)}(s)dtdsdx\\\\\n&=\\int_0^1\\int_0^1H(t,s)f^{(3)}(t)f^{(3)}(s)dtds\\tag{4}\n}\n$$ with $$H(t,s)=\\int_0^1\\left(x-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)k(x,t)k(x,s)dx\\tag{5}$$ Now, $H(s,t)=H(t,s)$ and for $0\\leq t\\leq s\\leq 1$ we find $$H(t,s)=\\frac{1}{240} (s-1)^2 t \\left(s^4 (t-2)+s^3 (t+2)+s^2 (1-4 t)+s t+(t-1) t^4\\right)$$ It is not very easy but we can show (see the remark below,) that $H$ is nonnegative, and this is the crucial point. As it is depicted in the next figure It follows from the condition $|f^{(3)}|\\leq 1$ that $$|{I}|\\leq \\int_0^1\\int_0^1H(t,s)dtds=\\frac{1}{30240}.$$ Remark. Let me add a proof of the positivity of $H(t,s)$ . Indeed, It is a matter of verification that for $0<t\\leq s\\leq 1$ we have $$\\eqalign{\\frac{240 }{(1-s)^2 t}H(t,s)&=\n(1-t) \\left(s^2-t^2\\right)+2 s^2 (1-s) (s-t)\\\\&\n+s (s+1) (1-s)^2 t+(1-t)^2 t^2 (t+1)}$$ which is  a sum of positive terms.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The original problem is about proving an inequality involving an integral of a function and its derivatives under certain conditions. \n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions from the problem statement. Let me read through it again carefully.\n\nThe problem states: Let f be in C³[0,1], which means f is three times continuously differentiable on the interval [0,1]. The conditions given are f(0) = 0, f'(0) = 0, f(1) = 0, and the absolute value of the third derivative f'''(x) is less than or equal to 1 for all x in [0,1]. The goal is to prove that the absolute value of 30240 times the integral from 0 to 1 of x(1-x)f(x)f'(x)dx is less than or equal to 1.\n\nSo, breaking down the assumptions:\n\n1. f is in C³[0,1]. This is a standard assumption for functions in calculus problems, ensuring that derivatives up to order three exist and are continuous. Each part of this assumption should be listed separately. Wait, but the format says each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So \"f is three times continuously differentiable on [0,1]\" would be one assumption. Then the next conditions are f(0)=0, f'(0)=0, f(1)=0, each of these is a separate condition on f. Then the bound on the third derivative: |f'''(x)| ≤ 1 for all x in [0,1]. That's another assumption.\n\nSo the assumptions should be listed as:\n\n- f ∈ C³[0,1]\n- f(0) = 0\n- f’(0) = 0\n- f(1) = 0\n- |f’’’(x)| ≤ 1 for all x ∈ [0,1]\n\nThen the problem is to prove that |30240 ∫₀¹ x(1−x)f(x)f’(x) dx| ≤ 1.\n\nWait, the original problem statement has the integral with x(1−x)f(x)f’(x) inside. The LaTeX in the original question is written as \"x(1-x)f(x)f'(x)\", which translates correctly.\n\nSo, when structuring, the problem line should restate the integral expression correctly. Also, check if there are any other hidden assumptions. The user example had split the assumptions into separate lines, each addressing one property. So here, the five points above are the assumptions.\n\nBut wait, the original problem mentions \"f ∈ C³[0,1]\" which includes that f is three times continuously differentiable. Then each of the boundary conditions (f(0)=0, f’(0)=0, f(1)=0) are separate. Then the bound on f''' is another.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have these five assumptions. Let me verify again:\n\nOriginal problem: \"Let f ∈ C³[0,1] such that f(0)=f’(0)=f(1)=0 and |f'''(x)| ≤ 1.\"\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n1. f is in C³[0,1].\n\n2. f(0) = 0.\n\n3. f’(0) = 0.\n\n4. f(1) = 0.\n\n5. |f’’’(x)| ≤ 1 for all x in [0,1].\n\nYes, that's correct. Each of these is a separate condition on f. Then the problem is to prove the inequality involving the integral.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list these assumptions line by line, then state the problem.\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is only one property. The user's example split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" into two assumptions. Similarly here, each condition on f is a separate assumption.\n\nSo, the final answer would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nf is three times continuously differentiable on [0,1],\nf(0) = 0,\nf’(0) = 0,\nf(1) = 0,\n|f’’’(x)| ≤ 1 for all x ∈ [0,1].\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\left|30240\\int_{0}^{1}x(1-x)f(x)f'(x)dx\\right|\\le1.$$\n###",
