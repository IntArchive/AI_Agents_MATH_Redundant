    "AcceptedAnswer": "Exploiting the evenness of the integrand, we can write $$\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x}{(1+x^2)^2\\,\\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{2}\\right)}\\,dx=\\frac12\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{x}{(1+x^2)^2\\,\\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{2}\\right)}\\,dx \\tag1$$ We can use contour integration to evaluate the integral on the right-hand side of $(1)$.  The function $\\frac{z}{(1+z^2)^2\\,\\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\pi z}{2}\\right)}$ has simple poles at $z=i2n$ for $n\\in \\mathbb{Z}\\setminus{0}$ and second order poles at $z=\\pm i$.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants to show that a certain integral equals π²/8 minus 1/2. The original integral is from 0 to infinity of x/(1+x²)² divided by tanh(πx/2) dx. \n\nLooking at the user's attempt, they did some substitutions. First, they let u = x/2, which changes the variable and scales the integral. Then they expressed coth(πu) as (e^{2πu} +1)/(e^{2πu}-1). Wait, but in the problem statement, the tanh term is πx/2, so substituting u = x/2 would make it tanh(πu), right? Then they changed variables again to v =4u², leading to an integral in terms of v. Then they expanded 1/(1+v)^2 as a binomial series, using (1+v)^{-2} = sum_{k=0}^\\infty ( (2)_k /k! ) (-1)^k v^k, perhaps? Then they substituted t = e^{√v}, which complicates things further, ending up with an integral from 1 to infinity involving t and ln(t) terms. \n\nBut the user is stuck at that point. The problem seems to involve a lot of substitutions that might not be leading towards a solution. Let me try to structure the problem properly.\n\nFirst, the integral to evaluate is ∫₀^∞ [x/(1+x²)²] / tanh(πx/2) dx. The user wants to show this equals π²/8 - 1/2.\n\nAssumptions: The integral is from 0 to infinity. The integrand is x divided by (1 + x²) squared, multiplied by 1 over tanh(πx/2). The problem is to evaluate this integral and show it's equal to π²/8 - 1/2. \n\nWait, the problem mentions \"filtered the unrelated information.\" The original question includes the user's attempt with substitutions. But when structuring the problem, I need to list the assumptions and present the problem. The user's own steps (like substitutions) might be part of their attempt, but the original problem as stated in the title and the first line is the key. \n\nSo the Assumptions should include the integral's limits (0 to infinity), the integrand's structure, and any conditions necessary for convergence or applicability of methods. For example, the integrand involves tanh(πx/2) which is defined for real x, and the integral is over positive real numbers. Also, the denominator (1+x²)^2 is always positive, so no issues there. The function is well-behaved except possibly at x=0 and as x approaches infinity. The integral converges because as x approaches infinity, the integrand behaves like x/(x^4) * 1/1 = 1/x^3, which is integrable. At x=0, tanh(πx/2) ~ πx/2, so the integrand behaves like x/(1) * 1/(πx/2) ) = 2/(π), which is finite. So the integral converges.\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't mention any particular conditions beyond the integral itself. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is taken from 0 to ∞,\nThe integrand is x/(1 + x²)² divided by tanh(πx/2).\n\nProblem: Show that ∫₀^∞ [x/((1 + x²)² tanh(πx/2))] dx = π²/8 - 1/2.\n\nWait, but in the original problem statement, the user wrote the integrand as \"x over (1+x^2)^2 multiplied by dx over tanh(...)\", which is a bit confusing. The correct integrand is x/( (1 + x²)^2 ) * 1/tanh(πx/2) dx. So the problem is correctly structured as such.\n\nThe user's own steps might not be part of the problem's assumptions. Therefore, the formatted problem should only include the integral as given in the title and the initial equation (1). The rest is the user's attempt, which we can ignore for structuring the problem.",
