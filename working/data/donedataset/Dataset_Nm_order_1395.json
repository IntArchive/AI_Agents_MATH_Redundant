    "Content": "I'm a PreCalculus student trying to find a rigorous proof that $\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{3} = 0.333\\ldots$, but I couldn't find it. I think (just think) that this proof would start by proving that $\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty}3\\cdot10^{-i} = \\frac{1}{3}$. My guesses (assuming that proving that $\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty}\\left(\\frac{1}{10}\\right)^i$ converges is trivial): $\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty}3\\cdot10^{-i} = 3\\cdot\\sum_{i = 1}^{\\infty}10^{-i} = 3\\cdot\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty}\\left(\\frac{1}{10}\\right)^i = 3\\cdot\\left(\\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{1}{10}}-1\\right) = 3\\cdot\\left(\\frac{10}{9}-1\\right) = \\frac{1}{3}$. Questions: is this completely rigorous? Which flaws could be found in this proof? How can I improve it? PS. I'm not sure how to tag this. Feel free to edit, if necessary.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Since $\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty 3\\cdot 10^{-i}$ is what the notation \"$0.333...$\" means , your argument is perfectly good. It's not just the \"start of a proof\", it is all there is to it . Okay, perhaps it is not really trivial to prove that the geometric series converges, but straightforward it is. Just plug in the definition of the sum of a series and crank the handle, using standard tricks to rewrite each of the partial sums in turn.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me tackle this problem. The user wants a rigorous proof that 1/3 equals 0.333..., and they attempted using an infinite series. First, I need to check their approach. They used the formula for the sum of a geometric series. The standard formula is sum from n=0 to infinity of r^n = 1/(1-r) if |r| < 1. Here, they started the sum at i=1 instead of i=0, so they adjusted by subtracting 1. That part seems right.\n\nBut wait, is the convergence of the series trivial as they said? For a precalculus student, maybe they need to mention that 1/10 is between -1 and 1, so the series converges. Also, they multiplied by 3, which is fine. So their steps look correct, but maybe the rigor is in justifying each step. For example, proving that the sum can be split into 3 times the sum, which requires knowing the series converges absolutely. Since it's a geometric series with |r| < 1, absolute convergence holds, so splitting the constant is valid.\n\nAnother point: the problem is about decimal representation. 0.333... is an infinite sum, so equating that to the limit of the partial sums is the definition. Maybe the student should define what 0.333... means formally as the limit of the sequence 0.3, 0.33, 0.333, etc. Then showing that this limit is indeed 1/3 via the geometric series.\n\nPossible flaws: They might be assuming the convergence without proof, but they mentioned that proving convergence is trivial. However, in a rigorous proof, one should at least cite the convergence criteria for geometric series. Also, starting the index at i=1 instead of i=0 might need clarification. The adjustment step where they subtract 1 is correct because the formula from i=0 would be 1/(1 - 1/10) = 10/9, so subtracting the i=0 term (which is 1) gives the sum from i=1 to infinity as 10/9 - 1 = 1/9, then multiplied by 3 gives 1/3. That seems solid.\n\nTo improve, maybe add a statement about the definition of decimal expansions as infinite series, confirm the convergence using the geometric series test, and validate each algebraic step. Also, addressing whether the manipulation of the series is justified (like pulling out the constant factor) by citing relevant theorems about series convergence. Alternatively, using the limit definition of partial sums and showing that the difference between 1/3 and the partial sums approaches zero.\n\nAnother angle: using the concept that if x = 0.333..., then 10x = 3.333..., subtracting gives 9x = 3, so x = 1/3. But the user is asking for a rigorous proof, so maybe this algebraic approach is considered less rigorous unless they define what it means to multiply and subtract infinite decimals. The series approach is more foundational here.\n\nSo in summary, the user's proof is correct but might need more justification on the steps involving the geometric series, especially starting index and constant multiplication. Also, explicitly stating that the decimal expansion is defined as the sum of the series would strengthen the rigor.",
