    "Content": "How can I prove that prove $n^5 - n$ is divisible by $30$ ? I took $n^5 - n$ and got $n(n-1)(n+1)(n^2+1)$ Now, $n(n-1)(n+1)$ is divisible by $6$ . Next I need to show that $n(n-1)(n+1)(n^2+1)$ is divisible by $5$ . My guess is using Fermat's little theorem but I don't know how.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I'm going to take a leap, and suppose that you are doing exercises from the first section of Ireland and Rosen. In that case, I think that FLT is not the 'anticipated' method of solution. So let's start from your factorization, $(n-1)n(n+1)(n^2 + 1)$ If $n$ is of the form $5k$, $5k-1$, or $5k+1$, we're done from the first three factors. What if $n$ is of the form $5k \\pm 2$? I claim to you that $n^2 + 1$ is always divisible by $5$ if $n = 5k \\pm 2$. Perhaps the easiest way to see this is through strict computation. Or you could note that the constant term is either $5$ or $10$. In any case, I leave that part to you: can you show that $n^2 + 1$ is divisible by $5$ if $n = 5k \\pm 2$?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The goal is to prove that \\( n^5 - n \\) is divisible by 30 without using reduction, as mentioned in the question. The user has already factored \\( n^5 - n \\) into \\( n(n-1)(n+1)(n^2 + 1) \\) and noted that the first part, \\( n(n-1)(n+1) \\), is divisible by 6. Now they need to show that the entire expression is divisible by 5, possibly using Fermat's little theorem.\n\nFirst, I need to recall that 30 factors into 2, 3, and 5. Since the user has already addressed divisibility by 6 (which is 2*3), the remaining part is to show divisibility by 5. So the key here is to demonstrate that \\( n^5 - n \\) is divisible by 5 for any integer n. \n\nFermat's little theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, \\( a^p \\equiv a \\mod p \\). Here, 5 is a prime number, so applying Fermat's little theorem, we have \\( n^5 \\equiv n \\mod 5 \\). Subtracting n from both sides gives \\( n^5 - n \\equiv 0 \\mod 5 \\), which means 5 divides \\( n^5 - n \\). Therefore, combining this with the previous divisibility by 6, the expression is divisible by 30.\n\nBut wait, the user mentioned not wanting to use reduction. Maybe they are looking for a more elementary approach without modular arithmetic? Let's see. Alternatively, we can factor the expression further. Let's consider \\( n^5 - n = n(n^4 - 1) = n(n^2 - 1)(n^2 + 1) = n(n-1)(n+1)(n^2 + 1) \\), which is the factorization the user provided. \n\nTo show divisibility by 5, we can analyze the possible residues of n modulo 5. For any integer n, n modulo 5 can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. \n\n- If n ≡ 0 mod 5, then n is divisible by 5, so the entire expression is divisible by 5.\n- If n ≡ 1 mod 5, then (n - 1) is divisible by 5.\n- If n ≡ 4 mod 5, which is equivalent to -1 mod 5, then (n + 1) is divisible by 5.\n- If n ≡ 2 or 3 mod 5, then n^2 + 1 would be 4 + 1 = 5 or 9 + 1 = 10, both divisible by 5.\n\nHence, in all cases, one of the factors in the expression \\( n(n-1)(n+1)(n^2 + 1) \\) is divisible by 5. Therefore, the product is divisible by 5, and since we already have divisibility by 6, the entire expression is divisible by 30.\n\nBut the user mentioned wanting to avoid reduction, so maybe they want an approach that doesn't explicitly use modular arithmetic. The factorization approach with case analysis based on residues is another way. However, Fermat's little theorem provides a more straightforward proof once you know it applies. \n\nThe problem as stated by the user is to prove divisibility by 30, which breaks down into 2, 3, and 5. The user has addressed 2 and 3 via the product of three consecutive integers (which is divisible by 6), so the remaining part is 5. The key assumptions here are that n is an integer and we need to show divisibility by 5 for the expression. However, the original problem doesn't specify any restrictions on n, so the only assumption is that n is an integer. The example provided in the user's question had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in this case, there's no such restriction. Therefore, the formatted problem should list the assumption that n is an integer, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 30.",
