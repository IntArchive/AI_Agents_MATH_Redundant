    "Content": "I need to prove that If $A$ is full column rank, then $A^TA$ is always invertible. I know when an $m \\times n$ matrix is full column rank, then its columns are linearly independent. But nothing more to use to prove the above theorem. I'd appreciate if you could give me some hints.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "It suffices to show that if $A^T A x = 0$ for some vector $x$, then $x = 0$. If $A^T A x = 0$, then\n$$0 = x^T A^T A x = (Ax)^T(Ax) = \\langle Ax, Ax \\rangle = \\lVert Ax \\rVert^2,$$\nwhich on the other hand implies that $Ax = 0$, so since $A$ has full rank, $x = 0$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object.\n\nThe problem here is about proving that if a matrix A is full column rank, then A transposed times A is always invertible. The original question mentions that A is an m×n matrix with full column rank, which means its columns are linearly independent. The user needs to extract assumptions from this.\n\nFirst, the main object is matrix A. The key properties are that A is full column rank. The example in the problem had two assumptions: one about n being an integer and another about n being divisible by 7. Here, the matrix A's properties should be listed as assumptions. So \"A is a full column rank matrix\" is one assumption. But wait, the problem states \"if A is full column rank\", so that's the primary condition. Additionally, since A is m×n, but the user didn't specify the dimensions in the problem statement. Wait, looking at the original question: the user wrote \"when an m × n matrix is full column rank\". So maybe the assumption includes that A is an m×n matrix with full column rank. But the problem statement to be formatted needs to have each assumption as a single line. So breaking it down:\n\n1. A is an m×n matrix.\n2. A has full column rank (i.e., its columns are linearly independent).\n\nBut in the example given, the assumptions were split into separate lines. For instance, in the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So here, similarly, the two properties of A (its dimensions and its rank) would be separate assumptions. Therefore, the assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\nA is an m×n matrix,\nA has full column rank.\n\nProblem:\nProve that A^TA is always invertible.\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is one line, one property. So the first line is about the dimensions of A, and the second is about its rank. The original problem says \"If A is full column rank\", but to structure it, the assumptions include the context that A is an m×n matrix with full column rank. Therefore, that's how it should be split.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nA is an m×n matrix,\nA has full column rank.\n\nProblem:\nProve that A^TA is always invertible.\n\nYes, that seems right. Each assumption is a single line addressing one property of A. The problem is then to prove the invertibility of A^TA under these conditions.",
