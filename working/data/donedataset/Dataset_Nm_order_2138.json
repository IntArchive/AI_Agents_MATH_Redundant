    "Content": "I want to prove that the only finite subgroups of $GL_2(\\mathbb Q)$ are $C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4, C_6, V_4, D_6, D_8,$ and $D_{12}$. First, we determine all possible finite orders of elements. Now, an element of order $n$ will have a minimal polynomial that divides $x^n-1$, so its (complex) roots will be distinct, and so the matrix will be diagonalizable over $\\mathbb C$. This implies that both eigenvalues are $n$th roots of unity, and that at least one is primitive, and so the minimal polynomial will be the $n$th cyclotomic polynomial. But since the minimal polynomial can only have degree $1$ or $2$, since we're dealing with $2\\times 2$ matrices, the only possible orders are those $n$ for which $\\phi(n)=1$ or $2$, so the only possible orders are $1, 2, 3, 4$, and $6$.  Thus, if $G$ is a finite subgroup of $GL_2(\\mathbb Q)$, then $|G|=2^a3^b$. Now, since $G$ contains a Sylow-$3$ of order $3^b$, and any $3$-group contains subgroups of every possible order, once we show that $C_3\\times C_3$ is not a subgroup of $GL_2(\\mathbb Q)$, then we can conclude that $b=0$ or $1$, since we already saw that $C_9$ cannot be a subgroup. WLOG, let $g=\\begin{bmatrix} 0&-1\\\\1&-1\\end{bmatrix}$, which is the Rational Canonical Form for the minimal polynomial $x^2+x+1$, and so has order $3$. We seek to show that there is no matrix $h$ such that $h$ has order $3$, commutes with $g$, and isn't a power of $g$. So assume $h=\\begin{bmatrix} a&b\\\\c&d\\end{bmatrix}$. Then $gh=\\begin{bmatrix} -c&-d\\\\a-c&b-d\\end{bmatrix}$ and $hg=\\begin{bmatrix} b&-(a+b)\\\\d&-(c+d)\\end{bmatrix}$. Equating these, we get that $c=-b, d=a+b$, so $h=\\begin{bmatrix} a&b\\\\-b&a+b\\end{bmatrix}$. For $h$ to have order $3$, the trace must be $-1$, and the determinant must be $1$, just like in the Rational Canonical Form, so $2a+b=1$, and $a^2+ab+b^2=1$. The solutions are $a=-1, b=1$ and $a=0, b=-1$. The latter gives $h=g$ and the former gives $h=g^2$, and so there can be no subgroup isomorphic to $C_3\\times C_3$, and thus $9$ does not divide the order of the group. Now, the next step would be to restrict the exponent of $2$, but I'm not quite sure how to do this. One part of the problem tells me to show that the only noncyclic abelian subgroup is $V_4$, the Klein-$4$ group. So if we let $g=\\begin{bmatrix} 0&1\\\\1&0\\end{bmatrix}$ be the RCF of $x+1$, then the only order $2$ matrices that commute with it are $-g$ and $-g^2=-I$, which form a Klein-$4$ group. This means that $C_2^3$ is not a subgroup. Also, if we get $g=\\begin{bmatrix} 0&-1\\\\1&0\\end{bmatrix}$ be the RCF of $x^2+1$, then the only order $2$ element that commutes with it is $-I=g^2$, so there is also no subgroup isomorphic to $C_4\\times C_2$. In a previous exercise, I showed that $Q_8$ is not a subgroup of $GL_2(\\mathbb R)$, and thus isn't a subgroup over $\\mathbb Q$ either. But this doesn't seem to prevent subgroups of order $16$, since $D_8$ is in fact a subgroup. Checking all $14$ groups of order $16$, it seems that all of them have an order $8$ subgroup besides $D_8$, but is there a cleaner way to rule out groups of order $16$ without classifying them, since I'm apparently supposed to conclude that the order of $G$ divides $24=2^3\\cdot 3$ from the fact that the Klein-$4$ group is the only noncyclic abelian subgroup. So now, if I assume as known that $24$ divides the order of $G$, then the possible orders for $G$ are $1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12$, and $24$. I can find $C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4, C_6, V_4, D_6, D_8,$ and $D_{12}$. This takes care of all the orders except $12$ and $24$. I can show that $C_{12}$ and $C_{6}\\times C_2$ are not subgroups, but I'm not sure how to rule out the nonabelian groups of order 12, $A_4$ and $C_3\\rtimes C_4$, or the groups of order $24$. So in summary, I'm a bit stuck in ruling out the nonabelian groups of order $12, 16,$ and $24$. Is there a more elegant way to do this than to look at the classifications of these groups and find subgroups which I have already shown to be impossible?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "One approach is the following: Let $M = M_{2}(\\mathbb{Q}).$ Note that if $x$ is an element of order $4$ or $3$ in $G,$ then the subalgebra $C_{M}(x)$ is a division ring by Schur's Lemma, as $x$ acts irreducibly. Hence $C_{G}(x)$ is cyclic. In particular,  Sylow $3$-subgroup of $G$ is cyclic, of order $3$ as you have shown already. Let $S$ be a Sylow $2$-subgroup of $G,$ and let $A$ be a maximal Abelian normal subgroup of $S$. If $A$ has exponent $2,$ then $A$ is elementary Abelian, and hence has order at most $4.$ Otherwise, $A$ contains an element $x$ of order $4,$ and then $A$ is cyclic as $C_{G}(x)$ is cyclic. Also, as you have shown, $|A| \\leq 4$ in that case. Now as $A$ is maximal Abelian normal in $S,$ we have $C_{S}(A) = A,$ and $S/A$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of ${\\rm Aut}(A).$ If $A$ is a Klein $4$-group, then ${\\rm Aut}(A) \\cong S_{3}$ and if $A$ is cyclic of order $,$ then ${\\rm Aut}(A)$ has order $2.$ Hence in either case, $|S| \\leq 8.$  Since you have already ruled out a quaternion group of order $8,$ the only possibility if $S$ is non-Abelian of order $8$ is that it is dihedral ( and we already know that if $|S| = 8,$ it is non-Abelian). By the way, you can't rule out all non-Abelian group of order $12,$ since a dihedral group with $12$ elements does occur. I don't know how much group theory you know, but I would finish as follows: let $F = F(G),$ the Fitting subgroup of $G.$ If $F$ contains an element of order $3$ or then $C_{G}(F) = F$ is cyclic of order $3$ or $6$ (for $F$ contains a central element of order $3$ in that case). Then $G/F$ has order dividing $2$. I won't give all details, but if $|G/F| =2,$ that leads to $G$ dihedral with $6$ or $12$ elements ($G=F$ leads to $G$ cyclic of order $3$ or $6$ in this case). There remains the case that $F$ is a $2$-group. If $F$ is Abelian , we have $F$ cyclic of order $4$ or a Klein $4$-group. The first possibility leads to $G = F.$ The second also leads to $G = F,$ eg by Clifford's theorem. there can be no element of order $3$ in $G$ in that case. If $F$ is non-Abelian of order $8,$ then we must also have $G = F$, because a dihedral group of order $8$ has no automorphism of order $3.$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the user's format. First, I need to read through the original question on Math Stack Exchange and extract the necessary information. The user wants me to filter out unrelated details and present the problem with clear assumptions and the main problem statement.\n\nThe original problem is about proving that the only finite subgroups of GL₂(ℚ) are specific groups: C₁, C₂, C₃, C₄, C₆, V₄, D₆, D₈, and D₁₂. The user has already gone through some steps, like determining possible element orders and showing that certain subgroups (like C₃×C₃) can't exist. They're stuck on ruling out nonabelian groups of orders 12, 16, and 24 without classifying all groups of those orders.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions from the problem. Each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. Let me go through the problem step by step.\n\n1. The problem is about finite subgroups of GL₂(ℚ). So the main object is a finite subgroup G of GL₂(ℚ).\n2. They mention that the order of elements in G must be such that φ(n) ≤ 2, leading to possible orders 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. So any element in G has order 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6.\n3. The group G has order 2^a3^b. This comes from previous steps where they ruled out higher primes.\n4. They showed that C₃×C₃ isn't a subgroup, so the Sylow-3 subgroup can't be larger than C₃. So b ≤ 1.\n5. They want to show that the only noncyclic abelian subgroup is V₄ (Klein-4). So any noncyclic abelian subgroup of G is isomorphic to V₄.\n6. Previous exercises showed that Q₈ isn't a subgroup of GL₂(ℝ), hence not in GL₂(ℚ). So Q₈ is excluded.\n7. The user is trying to rule out groups of order 16, 24, and nonabelian groups of order 12 without classification.\n\nNow, I need to structure these into individual assumptions. Each assumption should be a single condition on a single object. Let me list them:\n\nAssumption:\n- G is a finite subgroup of GL₂(ℚ).\n- Every element in G has order 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6.\n- The order of G is 2^a3^b for some non-negative integers a, b.\n- G does not contain a subgroup isomorphic to C₃×C₃.\n- The only noncyclic abelian subgroup of G is V₄.\n- Q₈ is not a subgroup of G.\n- The possible orders of G are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, or 24.\n\nWait, the user mentions possible orders up to 24 but wants to rule out 16, 24, etc. Maybe some assumptions need to be clarified. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe user says they concluded that |G| divides 24, so possible orders are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. But they need to rule out certain groups within these orders. However, the initial problem statement is to prove that the only finite subgroups are those listed, which are up to D₁₂ (order 12). So maybe the assumption here is that the order of G divides 24, but they need to show that certain groups of order 12, 16, 24 cannot exist.\n\nBut perhaps the key assumptions are about the element orders, the group order structure (2^a3^b), and existing subgroups. Let me try to list each assumption concisely:\n\nAssumption:\n- G is a finite subgroup of GL₂(ℚ).\n- Every element in G has order 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6.\n- The order of G is of the form 2^a3^b.\n- G does not contain a subgroup isomorphic to C₃×C₃.\n- The only noncyclic abelian subgroup of G is V₄.\n- Q₈ is not a subgroup of G.\n- Any Sylow-2 subgroup of G has exponent at most 4.\n\nWait, the user mentions something about Sylow-3 subgroups and Sylow-2. But maybe I should stick to what is explicitly stated. Let me go through each point again.\n\nOriginal problem steps:\n\n1. Determined possible element orders: n with φ(n)=1 or 2, so n=1,2,3,4,6.\n2. Hence, |G|=2^a3^b.\n3. Showed C₃×C₃ is not a subgroup ⇒ Sylow-3 is cyclic ⇒ b ≤1.\n4. For Sylow-2 part, trying to restrict exponent. Showed that V₄ is the only noncyclic abelian subgroup, and that C₄×C₂ isn't a subgroup. Also mentions Q₈ isn't a subgroup.\n5. Needs to rule out groups of order 16 (like D₈ is allowed, but others?), 24, and nonabelian groups of order 12.\n\nBut the user's problem is to prove the classification. The assumptions needed would be the conditions that lead to this classification. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- G is a finite subgroup of GL₂(ℚ).\n- Every element of G has order 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6.\n- The order of G is 2^a3^b with a ≤3 and b ≤1.\n- G does not contain a subgroup isomorphic to C₃×C₃.\n- The only noncyclic abelian subgroup of G is V₄.\n- Q₈ is not a subgroup of G.\n\nWait, the user says they need to show that nonabelian groups of order 12, 16, 24 are not possible. The problem is to prove that the only finite subgroups are the listed ones. The user's question is about how to rule out these remaining groups. So perhaps the problem is to complete this proof by ruling out those groups, given the prior assumptions.\n\nBut according to the example given, the formatted problem should list the assumptions and the problem statement. The original problem's goal is to prove the classification. So the assumptions would be the conditions that G is a finite subgroup of GL₂(ℚ), and the problem is to prove that G must be one of the listed groups.\n\nBut the user's example includes specific assumptions from the problem context. For instance, in the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7, and the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. Here, the user's own attempt includes several steps, and the problem is how to proceed from there.\n\nWait, the user is asking for help in structuring their problem according to the format. The original question on Math Stack Exchange is the user's own problem where they are stuck on certain parts. So the task is to read their question, filter out the extraneous details, and present the assumptions and the problem they need to solve.\n\nIn their detailed question, they have already established several points:\n\n- Possible element orders are 1,2,3,4,6.\n- |G|=2^a3^b, and b ≤1 because C₃×C₃ is excluded.\n- The only noncyclic abelian subgroup is V₄.\n- Q₈ is not a subgroup.\n- They need to rule out nonabelian groups of order 12, 16, 24.\n\nSo the problem they are stuck on is: Given these prior results, how to rule out the remaining groups (nonabelian of order 12, 16, 24) without resorting to classification.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be the established facts, and the problem is to complete the proof by ruling out those groups.\n\nBut to fit the format, I need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition on one object. Let's try:\n\nAssumption:\n- G is a finite subgroup of GL₂(ℚ).\n- Every element in G has order 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6.\n- The order of G is 2^a3^b with a ≤3 and b ≤1.\n- G does not contain a subgroup isomorphic to C₃×C₃.\n- The only noncyclic abelian subgroup of G is V₄.\n- Q₈ is not a subgroup of G.\n- The possible orders of G are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, or 24.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the only finite subgroups of GL₂(ℚ) are C₁, C₂, C₃, C₄, C₆, V₄, D₆, D₈, and D₁₂ by ruling out nonabelian groups of order 12, 16, and 24.\n\nAlternatively, since the user is specifically stuck on ruling out these groups, maybe the problem is more focused. But according to the example, the problem statement should be the main goal. In the example, it's \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" Here, the main goal is to prove the classification, but the user is at a step where they need to rule out certain groups.\n\nBut perhaps the problem statement as per the original question is: Prove that the only finite subgroups of GL₂(ℚ) are the listed ones. The assumptions are the conditions established so far. Therefore, formatted as:\n\nAssumption:\n- G is a finite subgroup of GL₂(ℚ).\n- Every element of G has order 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6.\n- The order of G is 2^a3^b.\n- G does not contain a subgroup isomorphic to C₃×C₃.\n- The only noncyclic abelian subgroup of G is V₄.\n- Q₈ is not a subgroup of G.\n- Possible orders of G are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the only finite subgroups of GL₂(ℚ) are C₁, C₂, C₃, C₄, C₆, V₄, D₆, D₈, and D₁₂.\n\nBut I need to ensure each assumption is a single condition on one object. For example, \"Every element of G has order 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6.\" That's one assumption. \"G is a finite subgroup of GL₂(ℚ)\" is another. \"The order of G is 2^a3^b\" is another. \"G does not contain C₃×C₃\" is another. \"The only noncyclic abelian subgroup is V₄\" is another. \"Q₈ is not a subgroup\" is another. \"Possible orders are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24\" is another. But maybe some of these can be combined or are redundant.\n\nWait, \"possible orders are...\" might be a consequence of previous assumptions rather than an assumption. The user mentions that since |G| divides 24, the possible orders are those. But perhaps that's part of the problem's context rather than an assumption. The key assumptions are:\n\n- G is finite in GL₂(ℚ).\n- Element orders restricted.\n- Group order is 2^a3^b.\n- No C₃×C₃.\n- Only noncyclic abelian is V₄.\n- No Q₈.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$G$ is a finite subgroup of $GL_2(\\mathbb{Q})$,\nEvery element in $G$ has order 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6,\nThe order of $G$ is of the form $2^a3^b$,\n$G$ does not contain a subgroup isomorphic to $C_3 \\times C_3$,\nThe only noncyclic abelian subgroup of $G$ is $V_4$,\n$Q_8$ is not a subgroup of $G$.\nProblem:\nProve that the only finite subgroups of $GL_2(\\mathbb{Q})$ are $C_1$, $C_2$, $C_3$, $C_4$, $C_6$, $V_4$, $D_6$, $D_8$, and $D_{12}$.",
