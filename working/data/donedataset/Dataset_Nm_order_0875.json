    "AcceptedAnswer": "Notation: $a\\operatorname{mod} m$ is the residue of $a$ modulo $m$. $v_r(a) = \\max\\{n\\ge 0: r^n\\mid a\\}$, $\\mathrm{ord}_{m}(a) = \\min\\{n\\ge 1: m\\mid a^n-1\\}$. As it was already explained here, we need to show that for some $n$ and $l$   $$p^n \\operatorname{mod} r^l < q^n \\operatorname{mod} r^l. $$\nAssume the contrary. Let $$k = \\mathrm{ord}_r p.$$ If $q^k\\neq 1\\pmod r$, then we are done with $n=k$, $l=1$. So we have $j:=\\mathrm{ord}_r q\\mid k$. Denote $$m = v_r(q^k-1).$$ If $v_r(p^k-1)>m$, then $n=k, l=m+1$ works. Case 1. $v_r(p^k-1)=m$. By Hensell's lifting lemma for any $l\\ge 1$\n$$\n\\mathrm{ord}_{r^{l+m}} p = r^l k,\\quad \\mathrm{ord}_{r^{l+m}} q = r^l j,\n$$\nso \n$$\n\\mathrm{ord}_{r^{l+m}} p^k = r^l,\\quad \\mathrm{ord}_{r^{l+m}} q^k = r^l.\\tag{1}\n$$ The group $\\mathbb{Z}^*_{r^{l+m}}$ of invertible elements modulo $r^{l+m}$ is cyclic of order $r^{l+m-1}(r-1)$. Let $\\varepsilon$ be its generator. Then it follows from $(1)$ that\n$$\np^k = \\varepsilon^{sr^m(r-1)} \\operatorname{mod} r^{l+m}, \\quad q^k = \\varepsilon^{tr^m(r-1)} \\operatorname{mod} r^{l+m},\\tag{2}\n$$\nwhere $r\\nmid st$. Now consider \n$$\np^k, p^{2k}, \\dots, p^{(r^{l}-1)k} \\operatorname{mod} r^{l+m}\n$$\nand \n$$\nq^k, q^{2k}, \\dots, q^{(r^{l}-1)k} \\operatorname{mod} r^{l+m}.\n$$\nBecause of $(2)$, both sequences contain $\\varepsilon^{r^m(r-1)}, \\varepsilon^{2r^m(r-1)},\\dots, \\varepsilon^{(r^{l}-1)r^m(r-1)}$ in some order. Since $p^{ik}\\operatorname{mod} r^{l+m} \\ge q^{ik}\\operatorname{mod} r^{l+m}$ for all $i$, then $p^{k}\\operatorname{mod} r^{l+m} = q^{k}\\operatorname{mod} r^{l+m}$. However, this cannot happen for $l$ large enough (so that $r^{l+m}>p^k$). This finishes the proof for this case. Case 2. $d:=v_r(p^k-1)<m$. Consider \n$$\np^{k-1}, p^{2k-1}, \\dots, p^{rk-1} \\operatorname{mod} r^{d+1}.\n$$\nFrom $q^{sk-1} = q^{k-1}\\operatorname{mod} r^{d+1}$ it follows that $p^{sk-1}\\operatorname{mod} r^{d+1} \\ge q^{k-1} \\operatorname{mod} r^{d+1}$. But $p^{sk-1}$ for $s=1\\dots,r$ have different residues modulo $r^{d+1}$ and the same residue modulo $r^{d}$. Therefore, the residues modulo $r^{d+1}$ are equal to $$p^{k-1}\\operatorname{mod} r^{d}, (p^{k-1}\\operatorname{mod} r^{d}) + r^{d}, \\dots, (p^{k-1}\\operatorname{mod} r^{d}) + (r-1)r^{d}$$ in some order. In particular, we get $q^{k-1} \\operatorname{mod} r^{d+1} \\le p^{k-1}\\operatorname{mod} r^{d}<r^{d}$. But then $$q^{k}\\operatorname{mod} r^{d+1} = \\big(q\\cdot (q^{k-1} \\operatorname{mod} r^{d+1})\\big)\\operatorname{mod} r^{d+1}$$ cannot be equal to $1$, since $q<r$. The proof is now complete.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about showing that there exists an integer n such that a prime number r divides the binomial coefficient of p^n and q^n, given some conditions on p, q, and r. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The problem states that p and q are positive integers, r is a prime, and the inequalities r > p > q > 1 hold. Each assumption should be on a separate line, addressing one property per line.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed as individual points. So here, the first assumption is that p and q are positive integers. Wait, but the original problem says \"two positive integers p,q\", so that's one assumption. Then, the prime r is given. Next, the inequalities: r is greater than p, which is greater than q, which is greater than 1. But each of these inequalities should be separate? Wait, the example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. So in this case, the conditions are:\n\n1. p and q are positive integers.\n2. r is a prime.\n3. r > p.\n4. p > q.\n5. q > 1.\n\nBut the example structures each assumption as applying to one object. For instance, in the example, the first assumption is about n being an integer, the second about n being divisible by 7. So perhaps here, each inequality is a separate assumption, each applying to different objects. Let me check the original problem statement again: \"Two positive integers p,q and a prime r are given, such that r>p>q>1.\" So the conditions are:\n\n- p and q are positive integers.\n- r is a prime.\n- r > p.\n- p > q.\n- q > 1.\n\nSo each of these is a separate assumption. However, the problem statement may not mention that p and q are positive integers, but the user says \"two positive integers p,q\". So yes, that's an assumption. Then r is a prime. Then the inequalities. Each of these is a separate condition. So I need to list each one on a separate line.\n\nThe problem is to show that there exists an n such that r divides the binomial coefficient of p^n choose q^n. So the problem statement is straightforward once the assumptions are laid out.\n\nI should check if there's any hidden assumption. The user mentions using Lucas' theorem, but that's part of their attempt, not part of the problem's given conditions. So I don't include that in the assumptions.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\np is a positive integer,\nq is a positive integer,\nr is a prime,\nr > p,\np > q,\nq > 1.\n\nProblem:\nShow that there exists an integer n such that r divides \\(\\dbinom{p^n}{q^n}\\).\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumptions were listed with each applying to one object. For instance, \"n is an integer\", \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, \"p is a positive integer\" and \"q is a positive integer\" can be separate lines. Then \"r is a prime\" as another. Then the inequalities: r > p, p > q, q > 1. Each inequality is a separate line. That's correct.\n\nI think that's all. The problem is then stated as showing the existence of such an n. So the formatted problem should have all these assumptions listed line by line, and the problem statement as given.",
