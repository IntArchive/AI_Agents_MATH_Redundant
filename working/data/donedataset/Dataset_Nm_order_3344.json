    "Content": "Towards the end of G. N. Watson's (one of the joint authors of famous book \"A Course of Modern Analysis\") paper \"The Final Problem: An Account of the Mock Theta Functions\" the following formula of Ramanujan is mentioned: $$\\int_{0}^{\\infty}e^{-3\\pi x^{2}}\\frac{\\sinh \\pi x}{\\sinh 3\\pi x}\\,dx = \\frac{1}{e^{2\\pi/3}\\sqrt{3}}\\sum_{n = 0}^{\\infty}\\frac{e^{-2n(n + 1)\\pi}}{(1 + e^{-\\pi})^{2}(1 + e^{-3\\pi})^{2}\\dots(1 + e^{-(2n + 1)\\pi})^{2}}\\tag{1}$$ where the term corresponding to $n = 0$ in the sum on the right is $1$. Is there way to establish this exotic integral formula? Or a reference to any existing proof of $(1)$ would be of great help.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I re-posted this on MO and got the desired answer. The answer to the question is contained in the same paper of G. N. Watson which is referred to in the question. The integral in the question comes up in the transformation formulas for the one of the several mock theta functions defined by Ramanujan. The series in equation $(1)$ of the question is the value of a certain mock theta function $\\omega(q)$ at the point $q = -e^{-\\pi}$. Let $q$ be real with $|q| < 1$ and we define the mock theta function $\\omega(q)$ via the equation $$\\omega(q) = \\sum_{n = 0}^{\\infty}\\frac{q^{2n(n + 1)}}{(1 - q)^{2}(1 - q^{3})^{2}\\dots (1 - q^{2n + 1})^{2}}\\tag{1}$$ so that $$\\omega(-q) = \\sum_{n = 0}^{\\infty}\\frac{q^{2n(n + 1)}}{(1 + q)^{2}(1 + q^{3})^{2}\\dots (1 + q^{2n + 1})^{2}}\\tag{2}$$ and the question asks us to prove $$\\int_{0}^{\\infty}e^{-3\\pi x^{2}}\\frac{\\sinh \\pi x}{\\sinh 3\\pi x}\\,dx = \\frac{q^{2/3}}{\\sqrt{3}}\\omega(-q)\\tag{3}$$ with $q = e^{-\\pi}$. Watson proves a transformation formula for $\\omega(-q)$ in his paper which uses the integral mentioned in the question. He shows that if $\\alpha, \\beta$ are positive real numbers such that $\\alpha\\beta = \\pi^{2}$ and $q = e^{-\\alpha}, q_{1} = e^{-\\beta}$ then $$q^{2/3}\\omega(-q) + \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{\\alpha}}q_{1}^{2/3}\\omega(-q_{1}) = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{3\\alpha}{\\pi}}I(\\alpha)\\tag{4}$$ where $$I(\\alpha) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty}e^{-3\\alpha x^{2}}\\frac{\\sinh \\alpha x}{\\sinh 3\\alpha x}\\,dx\\tag{5}$$ Putting $\\alpha = \\beta = \\pi$ in $(4)$ and noting that $q = q_{1} = e^{-\\pi}$ we get equation $(3)$. So the crux of the problem is to prove the transformation formula $(4)$ and this is a difficult task which Watson achieved via finding another suitable series representation for $\\omega(q)$ and using residue calculus to convert the series for $\\omega(q)$ into a contour integral. See Watson's paper for more details.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So the user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original question is about proving an integral formula presented by Ramanujan. Let me start by carefully reading the problem and extracting the necessary information.\n\nFirst, the title of the question mentions the integral formula involving an exponential function, hyperbolic sine terms, and a sum on the right-hand side. The user is asking for a way to establish this formula or a reference to an existing proof.\n\nNow, following the example provided, I need to list all assumptions line by line. Each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. Let me parse the integral formula given.\n\nThe integral is from 0 to infinity of e^(-3πx²) multiplied by (sinh πx)/(sinh 3πx) dx. The result is equal to a sum involving terms with exponents and products in the denominator. The key points here are the limits of integration, the integrand's form, and the structure of the sum on the right-hand side.\n\nAssumptions to list might include:\n\n- The integral is taken over the interval [0, ∞).\n- The integrand is e^{-3πx²} multiplied by the ratio of sinh πx to sinh 3πx.\n- The sum on the right-hand side starts from n=0 to infinity.\n- Each term in the sum involves e^{-2n(n+1)π} divided by the product of squared terms (1 + e^{-π})^2(1 + e^{-3π})^2…(1 + e^{-(2n+1)π})^2.\n- The term corresponding to n=0 in the sum is 1.\n\nWait, the problem statement mentions that the term for n=0 is 1. That's an important condition because sometimes sums start with n=0 but the term might not be explicitly defined. Here, it's specified, so that's an assumption about the sum's initial term.\n\nAlso, the integral involves specific functions: exponential decay, hyperbolic sine terms. The constants involved are multiples of π. The structure of the sum is a bit complex with products in the denominator. Each product term increments the exponent by 2π up to (2n+1)π. So each term in the product is (1 + e^{-(2k+1)π})^2 for k from 0 to n.\n\nBut the user is asking to prove this integral formula. So the problem is to show that this integral equals that sum expression. The assumptions are the specific forms of the integral and the sum, including the conditions on the variables and indices.\n\nI need to ensure that each assumption is listed as a separate line item. Let me check again:\n\n1. The integral is from 0 to infinity.\n2. The integrand is e^{-3πx²} multiplied by sinh(πx)/sinh(3πx).\n3. The sum on the right-hand side is over n from 0 to infinity.\n4. Each term in the sum is e^{-2n(n+1)π} divided by the product from k=0 to n of (1 + e^{-(2k+1)π})^2.\n5. The term when n=0 is defined as 1 (since the product from k=0 to 0 is just (1 + e^{-π})^2, but the term is 1 divided by that product, but according to the problem statement, the sum starts with n=0 term as 1. Wait, let me recheck the original formula.\n\nThe problem states: \"...the term corresponding to n = 0 in the sum on the right is 1.\" So when n=0, the expression is 1. Let me look at the formula:\n\nThe sum is (1/(e^{2π/3}√3)) multiplied by the sum from n=0 to ∞ of [e^{-2n(n+1)π} / product from k=0 to n (1 + e^{-(2k+1)π})^2]. The term when n=0 is 1. So for n=0, the numerator is e^{0} (since 2*0*(0+1)=0) which is 1, and the denominator is product from k=0 to 0 (1 + e^{-π})^2, which is (1 + e^{-π})^2. But according to the problem statement, the term at n=0 is 1. That suggests that either there's a typo in the problem statement, or perhaps the denominator product starts from k=1? Wait, no, the problem says \"the term corresponding to n = 0 in the sum on the right is 1\". So when n=0, the entire term in the sum is 1. Therefore, for n=0, the term is 1/(e^{2π/3}√3) * 1, and for n ≥1, it's the same expression. Wait, no. Wait, the formula is:\n\n1/(e^{2π/3}√3) * sum_{n=0}^\\infty [e^{-2n(n+1)π} / product_{k=0}^n (1 + e^{-(2k+1)π})^2 ]\n\nBut the problem states that the term for n=0 is 1. So that would mean that when n=0, the numerator is e^{0} =1, and the denominator is product_{k=0}^0 (1 + e^{-(2*0 +1)π})^2 = (1 + e^{-π})^2. Therefore, the term is 1/( (1 + e^{-π})^2 ), but the problem says the term is 1. Therefore, this suggests that perhaps the problem statement has a typo, or perhaps the user is clarifying that even though the denominator for n=0 is (1 + e^{-π})^2, the term is considered as 1. But that seems contradictory unless there's a different interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written in a way that when n=0, the product in the denominator is empty or 1, but that's not standard. Wait, no. The product from k=0 to n=0 would be the term at k=0, which is (1 + e^{-π})^2. Therefore, unless there's a mistake in the problem statement, perhaps the user is saying that the term when n=0 is defined as 1, overriding the formula. That is, perhaps the sum is written with n starting at 0, but for n=0, the term is 1, and for n≥1, it's the given expression. That would be an important assumption. Therefore, the assumption here is that the term for n=0 is 1, even though the general formula might suggest otherwise. Therefore, this is a specific condition to note.\n\nSo, compiling the assumptions:\n\n1. The integral is evaluated over the interval from 0 to ∞.\n2. The integrand is e^{-3πx²} multiplied by (sinh πx)/(sinh 3πx).\n3. The sum on the right-hand side starts at n = 0 and extends to infinity.\n4. Each term in the sum is e^{-2n(n+1)π} divided by the product from k=0 to n of (1 + e^{-(2k+1)π})².\n5. The term corresponding to n = 0 in the sum is defined as 1.\n\nEach of these points addresses a separate condition or property. Now, the problem is to prove that this integral equals the given sum expression multiplied by the factor 1/(e^{2π/3}√3).\n\nWait, but in the formula given, the entire expression is (1/(e^{2π/3}√3)) multiplied by the sum. So the problem is to show that the integral equals that expression. Therefore, the problem statement is to prove the equality between the integral and that expression, which includes the sum with the specified terms.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list the assumptions as above and then state the problem as proving the equality between the integral and the given sum expression.\n\nLet me verify each assumption again to ensure they are correctly separated:\n\n- The integral's limits: one assumption.\n- The integrand's form: another.\n- The sum's range: third.\n- The structure of each term in the sum: fourth.\n- The n=0 term being 1: fifth.\n\nYes, each is a separate condition applied to one object. So I think this covers all necessary parts. Now, I need to present this in the specified format without any markdown, just plain text with the sections.",
