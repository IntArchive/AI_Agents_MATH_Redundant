    "Content": "Let $G$ be a topological abelian group. Let $H$ be the intersection of all neighborhoods of zero. How is $H = \\mathrm{cl}(\\{0\\})$? Isn't the closure of a set $A$ the smallest closed set containing $A$ which is the same as the intersection of all closed sets containing $A$? But neighborhoods in $G$ are not necessarily closed. Thanks. (Edit) To see that $H$ is a subgroup: First note that by construction $H$ contains $0$. Furthermore, $f: x \\mapsto -x$ is continuous and its own inverse so that $f$ is also open. Hence $U$ is a neighborhood of $0$ if and only if $-U$ is. Now let $x \\in H$. Then $x$ is in every neighborhood $U$ of $0$. Hence $x$ is in every neighborhood $-U$ of $0$. Hence $-x$ is in $U$ and hence in $H$. Alternatively one can verify it as follows: $$x \\in H \\iff x \\in \\bigcap_{U \\text{ nbhd of } 0} U \\iff x \\in \\bigcap_{U \\text{ nbhd of } 0} -U \\iff -x \\in \\bigcap_{U \\text{ nbhd of } 0} U \\iff -x \\in H$$ To see that $x+y$ is in $H$ if $x,y \\in H$, note that $g: (x,y) \\mapsto x+y$ is continuous. Now let $V$ be an arbitrary neighborhood of $0$. Then since $g$ is continuous there exists a neighborhood $N \\times M$ of $(0,0)$ such that $g(N \\times M) \\subset V$. Since $G \\times G$ has the product topology, $N \\times M$ is a neighborhood of $0$ if and only if $N$ and $M$ are neighborhoods of $0$. Hence $x,y \\in N$ and $x,y \\in M$ and hence $g((x,y)) = x + y \\in V$ since $g(N \\times M) \\subset V$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "$\\def\\cl{\\mathop{\\mathrm{cl}}}$ For $x \\in G$, let $\\mathcal U_x$ denote the set of all neighbourhoods of $x$.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original question is about showing that the intersection of all neighborhoods of zero in a topological abelian group is a subgroup and how this relates to the closure of the singleton set containing zero.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions from the problem. The user mentioned that each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. Let's start by identifying all the conditions given in the problem.\n\nThe problem states that G is a topological abelian group. So that's one assumption. Then H is defined as the intersection of all neighborhoods of zero. The user is asking how H equals the closure of {0}. They also mention that the closure of a set A is the smallest closed set containing A, which is the intersection of all closed sets containing A. However, neighborhoods in G aren't necessarily closed, which complicates things. The user then provides an edit where they attempt to show H is a subgroup by verifying closure under inverses and addition.\n\nSo the main assumptions here are:\n1. G is a topological abelian group.\n2. H is the intersection of all neighborhoods of zero.\n3. The closure of a set A is the intersection of all closed sets containing A.\n4. Neighborhoods in G are not necessarily closed.\n\nWait, but the problem is to show H is a subgroup and that H equals the closure of {0}. The user is confused because they know closure is the intersection of all closed sets containing A, but H is the intersection of all neighborhoods (not necessarily closed) of zero. So maybe the key assumptions here are about the structure of G and the properties of H.\n\nLooking back at the example provided, the assumptions were about the variable n being an integer and divisible by 7. Similarly, here, the problem is set in the context of a topological abelian group, which is a key assumption. Then H is defined as the intersection of all neighborhoods of zero. The problem then is to show H is a subgroup and that it's equal to the closure of {0}.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n- G is a topological abelian group.\n- H is the intersection of all neighborhoods of 0 in G.\n- The closure of a set A in G is the intersection of all closed sets containing A.\n\nWait, but the user is asking why H equals cl({0}), given that closure is the intersection of all closed sets containing {0}, but H is the intersection of all neighborhoods (which might not be closed). So maybe another assumption is that in a topological group, the intersection of all neighborhoods of the identity is a subgroup, and specifically, in this case, it's the closure of {0}.\n\nBut I need to list each assumption line by line. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nThe problem as stated in the question:\n\"Let G be a topological abelian group. Let H be the intersection of all neighborhoods of zero. How is H = cl({0})? [...]\"\n\nSo the problem is to show that H, the intersection of all neighborhoods of 0, is equal to the closure of {0}. The user is confused because closure is the intersection of all closed sets containing {0}, but neighborhoods aren't necessarily closed.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions needed are:\n- G is a topological abelian group.\n- H is defined as the intersection of all neighborhoods of 0 in G.\n- The closure of a set A in G is the smallest closed set containing A, which is the intersection of all closed sets containing A.\n- Neighborhoods in G are not necessarily closed.\n\nBut wait, the problem is not just to list the given information, but the assumptions of the problem. The original problem is to show that H is a subgroup and H equals cl({0}). The user already knows that closure is the intersection of closed sets containing A, but since neighborhoods might not be closed, how does H relate to cl({0}).\n\nSo perhaps the key assumptions here are:\n\n1. G is a topological abelian group.\n2. H is the intersection of all neighborhoods of 0 in G.\n3. The closure of {0} is the intersection of all closed sets containing {0}.\n\nBut the problem is to show H = cl({0}), so these are the given conditions. The user's confusion arises because they thought H would be the closure, but since neighborhoods aren't closed, why is H equal to cl({0})? The answer probably lies in the properties of topological groups, where the intersection of all neighborhoods of the identity (in this case, 0) is the closure of the singleton. Maybe in topological groups, the closure of {0} can be expressed as the intersection of all neighborhoods, but I need to check.\n\nWait, in general topology, the closure of a point is the intersection of all closed sets containing it. But in a topological group, the intersection of all neighborhoods of the identity is a subgroup, and in abelian groups, it's also a subgroup. Moreover, in a topological group, the closure of the trivial subgroup {0} is the intersection of all closed neighborhoods of 0, but perhaps in this case, because the group is abelian and the topology is compatible, the intersection of all neighborhoods (not necessarily closed) of 0 is the same as the closure. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe in a topological group, every neighborhood of the identity contains a closed neighborhood, so the intersection of all neighborhoods is the same as the intersection of all closed neighborhoods, hence equal to the closure. If that's the case, then the assumption would be that in a topological group, every neighborhood of 0 contains a closed neighborhood, which is a property of topological groups. But the user didn't mention that. However, the problem might be relying on that property.\n\nBut the user's question is to see why H = cl({0}), given that closure is the intersection of closed sets containing {0}, but H is the intersection of all neighborhoods. So the answer would involve showing that in a topological group, the closure of {0} is indeed the intersection of all neighborhoods of 0, perhaps because each neighborhood contains a closed neighborhood, making the intersection of all neighborhoods equal to the intersection of all closed neighborhoods.\n\nBut since the user is working in a topological abelian group, we can use the property that the intersection of all neighborhoods of 0 is the same as the closure of {0}. However, this might not hold in general topological spaces but holds in topological groups due to their homogeneity and the existence of symmetric neighborhoods.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions to list would be:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a topological abelian group,\nH is the intersection of all neighborhoods of 0 in G,\nThe closure of a set A in G is the intersection of all closed sets containing A.\n\nProblem:\nProve that H = cl({0}).\n\nBut wait, the original problem's title is \"Intersection of all neighborhoods of zero is a subgroup\", and the user is asking how H = cl({0}). So the problem as posed is to show that H is a subgroup and that it's equal to the closure of {0}.\n\nSo perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a topological abelian group,\nH is the intersection of all neighborhoods of 0 in G.\n\nProblem:\nProve that H is a subgroup of G and H = cl({0}).\n\nBut in the example given, the assumptions included both the general condition (n is an integer) and a specific one (n is divisible by 7). Here, the problem is in the context of a topological abelian group, and H is defined in a certain way. So perhaps the assumptions are just those two.\n\nThe user's edit shows their attempt to prove H is a subgroup by checking closure under inverses and addition. The main problem is to show H is a subgroup and equal to the closure of {0}.\n\nBut according to the user's question, they are asking \"How is H = cl({0})?\" and also mention that they know the closure is the intersection of all closed sets containing A, but neighborhoods aren't necessarily closed. So the problem is to show that H, the intersection of all neighborhoods of 0, equals the closure of {0}.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a topological abelian group,\nH is the intersection of all neighborhoods of 0 in G,\nThe closure of a set A in G is the intersection of all closed sets containing A.\n\nProblem:\nProve that H = cl({0}).\n\nBut the user also mentions that they are trying to see H is a subgroup, so perhaps the problem is twofold: show H is a subgroup and H = cl({0}).\n\nAlternatively, since the title is \"Intersection of all neighborhoods of zero is a subgroup\", and the question body asks how H = cl({0}), maybe the problem is to prove both that H is a subgroup and that it's equal to the closure of {0}.\n\nBut the user's main confusion is about the equality H = cl({0}), given the definition of closure. So perhaps the problem as posed is to show that H is a subgroup and H = cl({0}).\n\nHowever, the example given in the instruction has the problem statement as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" with assumptions on n. So here, the problem would be structured as:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a topological abelian group,\nH is the intersection of all neighborhoods of 0 in G.\n\nProblem:\nProve that H is a subgroup of G and H = cl({0}).\n\nAlternatively, split into two problems? But the user's question is about both showing H is a subgroup and explaining why it's equal to the closure. However, the example in the instruction had the problem as a single statement to prove. So perhaps the problem here is to prove that H is a subgroup and H equals the closure of {0}.\n\nBut the user's main question is how H equals cl({0}), given their understanding of closure. So maybe the problem is to show H = cl({0}), with the subgroup part being a step towards that.\n\nAlternatively, the original title is about H being a subgroup, but the question body is about H = cl({0}).\n\nGiven that, the formatted problem should capture both aspects. However, according to the user's example, the problem statement in the formatted version was the specific mathematical statement to prove. So in this case, the problem would be to prove that H (the intersection of all neighborhoods of 0) is equal to the closure of {0} and is a subgroup.\n\nBut perhaps the key problem here is to prove that H is equal to the closure of {0}, and as part of that, showing it's a subgroup. Alternatively, the problem could be split into two parts, but the user's main question is about the equality H = cl({0}).\n\nConsidering the example, the problem was stated as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" with assumptions on n. Similarly, here, the problem would be to prove that H equals cl({0}), given that G is a topological abelian group and H is the intersection of all neighborhoods of 0.\n\nHowever, the user's edit shows they have already worked out that H is a subgroup, but are stuck on the closure part. Therefore, the problem as per the user's question is primarily about showing H = cl({0}).\n\nThus, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a topological abelian group,\nH is the intersection of all neighborhoods of 0 in G.\n\nProblem:\nProve that H = cl({0}).\n\nBut the user also mentions the closure of a set being the intersection of all closed sets containing it. So maybe that's another assumption, but that's a general topology fact, not specific to the problem. The example in the instruction included assumptions specific to the problem (n is integer, n divisible by 7), but didn't include general mathematical knowledge. So perhaps the only assumptions are about G and H.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a topological abelian group,\nH is the intersection of all neighborhoods of 0 in G.\n\nProblem:\nProve that H = cl({0}).\n\nBut the user's original title was about H being a subgroup, so perhaps the problem is two-fold. However, the example in the instruction didn't split the problem into parts. The original example had a single problem statement. Therefore, maybe the problem here is to prove both that H is a subgroup and that H = cl({0}).\n\nBut the user's main confusion is about the equality H = cl({0}), not the subgroup part. The user's edit shows they already worked out the subgroup part. So the main problem is to show H = cl({0}).\n\nThus, the correct formatted problem is:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a topological abelian group,\nH is the intersection of all neighborhoods of 0 in G.\n\nProblem:\nProve that H = cl({0}).\n\nBut wait, in the original problem statement from the user, they also mention that they know closure is the intersection of all closed sets containing A, but neighborhoods aren't necessarily closed. So maybe another assumption is that in G, the closure of {0} is the intersection of all closed neighborhoods of 0. But that's part of the proof, not an assumption.\n\nSo, sticking to the given information, the assumptions are G is a topological abelian group, and H is defined as the intersection of all neighborhoods of 0. The problem is to prove H = cl({0}).\n\nYes, that seems correct. The user's question is why H equals the closure of {0}, given that closure is defined as the intersection of closed sets containing {0}, but H is the intersection of all neighborhoods (not necessarily closed). The answer would involve showing that in topological groups, the intersection of all neighborhoods of 0 is the same as the closure of {0}, perhaps because every neighborhood contains a closed neighborhood, so the intersection of all neighborhoods is the same as the intersection of all closed neighborhoods, which is the closure.\n\nBut for the purpose of structuring the problem, the assumptions are just G is a topological abelian group and H is the intersection of all neighborhoods of 0. The problem is to prove H equals the closure of {0}.",
