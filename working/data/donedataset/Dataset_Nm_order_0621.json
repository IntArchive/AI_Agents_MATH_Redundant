    "Content": "Prove that any real number $r$ can be expressed as the sum of two irrational numbers $x$ and $y$. Progress: I have a specific example for any rational number $r$: $x = r-\\pi$ and $y = \\pi$ (or replace $\\pi$ with any irrational number.) However, I can't seem to find a way to prove this in general for irrational $r$. Any help is greatly appreciated.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If $r$ is irrational, then $r=\\frac{r}2+\\frac{r}2$. To tell the truth, for $r$ rational we also have $r=\\frac{r}2+\\frac{r}2$, but it is not useful in this case. :-)",

The key lies in leveraging the uncountable nature of irrational numbers and avoiding cases where the decomposition might accidentally produce a rational component.",
    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to prove that any real number can be expressed as the sum of two irrational numbers. They already have a method for rational numbers but are stuck on irrationals. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the assumptions. The problem states \"any real number,\" so r can be rational or irrational. The example given works for rational r by subtracting an irrational (like π) from r and then adding the same irrational. But for irrational r, this approach might not work because if you subtract an irrational from another irrational, the result could be rational or irrational. For instance, if r is π + √2, then choosing x = π and y = √2 would work, but that's a specific case. We need a general method.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a different approach. Let me think. Suppose r is irrational. We need to find two irrationals x and y such that x + y = r. If we fix x as some irrational, say √2, then y would be r - √2. But then y could be irrational or not. If r is √2 + 1, then y = 1, which is rational. So that approach fails. \n\nAlternatively, can we split r into two parts such that both are irrational? For example, take x = r/2 + t and y = r/2 - t, where t is some irrational number. Then x + y = r. But we need to ensure both x and y are irrational. If r is irrational, then r/2 is irrational. Adding and subtracting an irrational t would keep them irrational? Suppose t is irrational, then x = (irrational) + (irrational) could be either rational or irrational. For example, if t = r/2, then x = r which is irrational, and y = 0 which is rational. That's bad.\n\nHmm, maybe a different strategy. Let's consider the case where r is irrational. Let's pick x = a + b and y = -b, where a is irrational and b is chosen such that x and y are both irrational. Wait, that might not help. Alternatively, use a similar approach to the rational case but adjust for irrationals. \n\nWait, the original example for rational r uses y = π and x = r - π, which works because a rational minus an irrational is irrational. But for irrational r, r - π could be rational or irrational. For example, if r = π + 1, then x = 1, which is rational. So that approach doesn't work. \n\nMaybe we need to partition the irrationals into two parts such that both parts are irrational. One way to do this is to take an irrational number and split it into two irrationals. For instance, if r is irrational, then we can write r = (r + q) - q, where q is irrational. But then (r + q) could be rational if q is chosen as -r + rational. Wait, that's not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, can we use a density argument? The irrationals are dense in the real numbers, so for any real r, there exist irrationals x and y such that x + y = r. But how to construct them explicitly? \n\nAnother idea: Suppose we fix x = r - y. If r is irrational, then we need to choose y such that both y and r - y are irrational. Let's suppose y is irrational. Then we need to ensure that r - y is also irrational. But if y is such that r - y is rational, then y would be r - q, where q is rational. So we need to avoid y = r - q for any rational q. However, there are uncountably many irrationals and only countably many rationals, so most y's would work. But this is a non-constructive argument. \n\nWait, the problem might not require an explicit construction, just existence. So if r is irrational, then we can say that there exist two irrationals x and y such that x + y = r. Since the set of irrationals is uncountable and closed under addition with certain conditions, maybe we can use cardinality or measure theory. But the problem might expect a more straightforward approach. \n\nAlternatively, consider that if r is irrational, then at least one of x or y must be irrational. But we need both. For example, take x = r/2 + √2 and y = r/2 - √2. Then x + y = r. Both x and y are irrational if r is irrational, because r/2 is irrational, and adding/subtracting √2 (irrational) keeps them irrational. Because the sum of two irrationals can be rational or irrational, but here, x and y are each the sum of an irrational (r/2) and another irrational (√2). Wait, but is that necessarily irrational? Let's test with an example. Suppose r = 2√2. Then x = √2 + √2 = 2√2, which is irrational. y = √2 - √2 = 0, which is rational. Oh no, that's a problem. So this approach might not work. \n\nWait, so in this case, if r = 2√2, then y would be zero. That's bad. So this method fails. Therefore, we need a different way. \n\nAlternatively, suppose we take x = a and y = r - a, where a is chosen such that both a and r - a are irrational. For irrational r, if we pick a to be irrational, can r - a ever be rational? Yes, if a = r - q for some rational q. So to avoid that, we need to choose a not of that form. But since there are uncountably many irrationals and only countably many rationals, almost all choices of a would work. So such a exists, but we need to prove it exists. \n\nBut how to formalize this? Maybe by contradiction. Assume that for some irrational r, every decomposition r = x + y has at least one of x or y rational. Then, for all x irrational, y = r - x must be rational. But that would mean that the set of irrationals is mapped to rationals via y = r - x, which is impossible because the irrationals are uncountable and the rationals are countable. Hence, there must exist some x irrational such that y = r - x is also irrational. Therefore, such x and y exist. \n\nBut the original question might expect a more constructive approach. However, since the user is okay with the example for rational r, maybe they accept an existence proof for irrational r. \n\nSo the assumptions would be: r is a real number. The problem is to prove that there exist two irrational numbers x and y such that x + y = r. \n\nBut wait, the original problem didn't mention any specific conditions on r except being real. The example given for rational r works by subtracting an irrational. For irrational r, the existence proof via cardinality works. So the formatted problem should list the assumptions as r being a real number, and the problem is to express it as the sum of two irrationals. But in the example provided in the user's instruction, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But in this case, maybe the only assumption is that r is real. \n\nWait, the original problem's example had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So the user's example includes two assumptions. But in the current problem, the only assumption is that r is a real number. Therefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption: \nr is a real number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that r can be expressed as the sum of two irrational numbers x and y.\n\nBut the user's original problem mentions that for rational r, they have a method, but for irrational r, they need help. So maybe the problem is split into cases, but the general statement is for any real number. Therefore, the formatted problem should not have additional assumptions beyond r being real. Hence, the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption: \nr is a real number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that r can be expressed as the sum of two irrational numbers x and y.\n\nBut let me check the user's example again. In their example, the original problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted assumption added that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no, actually, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n)... is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, the user wrote assumptions as n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which restricts n. That would change the problem. But maybe the example was a mistake, or perhaps the user intended to show how to filter out unrelated info. Wait, perhaps in the original problem, the user made a mistake in formatting. Alternatively, maybe there was a typo. But in any case, following the current problem, the user wants to structure the problem by listing all assumptions line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object.\n\nIn the current problem, the only assumption is that r is a real number. Therefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nr is a real number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that r can be expressed as the sum of two irrational numbers x and y.\n\nBut the original problem's title says \"any real number\", so yes, that's the assumption. Therefore, the formatted problem should be as above.",
