    "Content": "I made a note some time ago that I had read in some book that the equation $$313(x^3+y^3)=t^3$$ has positive integer solutions, but that these are so large that it would be absolutely hopeless to search for them with computers.  Unfortunately, I didn't write down where I read this and if you only have the equation, the results Google gives you aren't very helpful.  I could only find this so far. Can someone point me to an article or book where I can read more about this equation?  (Preferably something with a proof of the claim above which is accessible even if you're not an expert in number theory.)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The equation $313(x^3+y^3) = t^3$ is equivalent to finding, $$x^3+y^3=313^2z^3\\tag1$$ As Achille Hui points out, Noam Elkies found the solution with $83$-digits, $$\\small x_0 = 355507307842882624593086325021133856149447336710120844428552934573043094018915\n289363\\\\\n\\small y_0 = -354602746692986709129018423204648314355484458881941451025238387384142099383045\n862152 \\\\\n\\small z_0 =1517122651849438712721950935044230084378368307868200665761294465082177989014675811$$ Update : Curiously, $3(x_0+y_0) = (3\\cdot 7\\cdot 8273\\cdot 64072783\\cdot 125303678787043)^3$. However, the OP wants them positive . Using the method also discussed in this post , given an initial solution to, $$ax^3+by^3 = cz^3\\tag2$$ then a new one can be derived as, $$a(-bxy^3-cxz^3)^3 + b(ax^3y+cyz^3)^3 = c(-ax^3z+by^3z)^3\\tag3$$ We can use $(3)$ iteratively to find an infinite number of solutions. We have, $$x_0,y_0,z_0 = +,\\,-,\\,+\\\\\nx_1,y_1,z_1 = +,\\,-,\\,-\\\\\nx_2,y_2,z_2 = +,\\,-,\\,+\\\\\nx_3,y_3,z_3 = +,\\,-,\\,-\\\\\nx_4,y_4,z_4 = \\color{red}{+,\\,+,\\,+}\n$$ and so on. So the fourth iteration is all positive . Approximately, $$x_4 = 1.908757×10^{21389}\\\\\ny_4 = 4.955536×10^{21389}\\\\\nz_4 = 1.095063×10^{21388}$$ They are too long to explicitly write down, but if you have Mathematica , you can retrace the steps taken and see those numbers in all their glory.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original problem is about the equation 313(x³ + y³) = t³ having titanic solutions. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The problem states that the equation has positive integer solutions, but they are extremely large. The question is asking for a reference to an article or book that discusses this equation and provides a proof of the claim. \n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are conditions applied to the objects in the problem. In this case, the equation involves x, y, t being positive integers. The problem is to find references or proofs about the existence of these solutions being titanic.\n\nWait, the original problem doesn't explicitly state assumptions like \"x, y, t are positive integers\" but it's implied since it's a Diophantine equation. However, the example included assumptions even if they were part of the problem statement. So perhaps I should list the variables being positive integers as assumptions.\n\nSo assumptions would be:\n- x is a positive integer.\n- y is a positive integer.\n- t is a positive integer.\n- The equation 313(x³ + y³) = t³ holds.\n\nThe problem is to find a reference or proof that these solutions are titanic. But the example's problem was to prove divisibility. Here, the problem is to point to a source discussing the solutions. But according to the format, the problem is the main question. So the problem part should be the original question rephrased concisely.\n\nWait, the user's example had the problem as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" So in this case, the problem would be \"Prove that the equation 313(x³ + y³) = t³ has positive integer solutions, which are extremely large (titanic).\" But the original question is asking for references, not the proof itself. Hmm. But the user's task is to structure the problem as per the format. The example included the problem as a statement to prove, even if the original question was asking for a proof. Here, the original question is asking for references. But according to the user's instruction, the task is to structure the problem as per the example, filtering unrelated info. The example seems to have taken the problem statement and rephrased it as a problem to prove, even if the original was a question. But maybe in this case, the problem part should be the actual mathematical claim, even if the original question is asking for references. Wait, the example given was: Original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and formatted problem was the same. Here, the original problem is about the equation having titanic solutions, so the problem part would be the assertion that the equation has positive integer solutions which are titanic. Then the user is to format that into assumption and problem. The assumptions are the conditions (x,y,t positive integers, equation holds), and the problem is to prove that such solutions exist and are titanic. But the original question is asking for references where this is discussed. Hmm. But the user's example included the problem as a statement to prove, even if the original question was a request for proof. So perhaps in this case, the problem part would be the claim that the equation has positive integer solutions with titanic size, and the assumptions are the variables being positive integers. But the original problem doesn't state that the user wants to prove it, but rather to find references. However, the example seems to ignore the request for references and just takes the mathematical statement. So following that approach, perhaps the problem part is \"Prove that the equation 313(x³ + y³) = t³ has positive integer solutions, which are extremely large (titanic).\" But the original question says \"the equation has positive integer solutions, but these are so large...\" So the problem is to prove that such solutions exist and are titanic. Therefore, the assumptions are that x, y, t are positive integers, and the equation holds. The problem is to prove that such solutions exist and are titanic. However, the user's example included assumptions like \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" But in the original problem here, the equation is given, so the assumptions would be about the variables. But the problem might not have explicit assumptions beyond the variables being positive integers. So perhaps:\n\nAssumptions:\n- x is a positive integer,\n- y is a positive integer,\n- t is a positive integer,\n- 313(x³ + y³) = t³.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the equation 313(x³ + y³) = t³ has positive integer solutions with extremely large (titanic) values.\n\nBut the original question is asking for a reference, but according to the user's example, the problem part is the mathematical statement to prove. So maybe we structure it as the problem to prove the existence of titanic solutions. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem is structured as a request for references, but the format requires the problem to be the mathematical claim. The example given by the user took the original problem which was to prove something and structured it as a problem to prove. In this case, the original problem is stating that the equation has solutions and they are titanic, and the user is asking for references. But the formatted problem should capture the mathematical problem, not the request for references. So the problem part would be the statement that needs to be proven, which is that the equation has positive integer solutions which are titanic. Hence, the assumptions are x,y,t positive integers, and the equation holds. But in the example, the assumptions included conditions on n. Here, perhaps the only assumptions are that x,y,t are positive integers, and the equation is given. But the problem is to prove that solutions exist and are titanic. So I'll structure it that way.",
