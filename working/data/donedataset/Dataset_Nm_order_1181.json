    "Content": "I had studied group theory a year ago, but still could not understand the proof involving The Correspondence theorem. let $G$ be a group and let $N⊴G$ , where $N⊴G$ indicates that $N$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ . Then there is a bijection from the set of subgroups $A$ of $G$ that contain $N$ onto the set of subgroups $\\overline A $ = $A/N$ of $G/N.$ Can anyone explain the steps to me in: $(1.)$ a very easy-going manner so that I understand importance of each step. $(2.)$ I don't require the proof but only how the step follow each other . I'll be thankful if there is anyone kind enough to do this....",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Perhaps it is clearer if you consider the (apparently) more general setting: Let $\\phi: G \\to G'$ be a homomorphism of groups. Then $\\phi$ induces two maps on the sets $ \\Gamma$ and $\\Gamma'$ of subgroups of $G$ and $G'$ respectively. $\\phi_* : \\Gamma \\to \\Gamma'$ given by $\\phi_*(H)=\\phi(H)$ $\\phi^* : \\Gamma' \\to \\Gamma$ given by $\\phi^*(H')=\\phi^{-1}(H')$ These maps preserve inclusions but they are not the inverse of each other because $\\phi_*(H)$ is always a subgroup of the image of $\\phi$ and $\\phi^*(H')$ always contains the kernel of $\\phi$. However, when restricted to the set of subgroups of $G$ that contain the kernel of $\\phi$ and the set of subgroups of $G'$ that are contained in the image of $\\phi$, then these maps are the inverse of each other. This is the correspondence theorem. More generally, $\\phi_*\\phi^*(H') = H' \\cap \\mbox{im}\\ \\phi$ and $\\phi^*\\phi_*(H) = \\langle H, \\ker \\phi \\rangle$, the smallest subgroup of $G$ that contains $H$ and $\\ker \\phi$; this happens to be $ H \\ker \\phi$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to format the question from Math Stack Exchange according to the specified structure. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe original question is about the Correspondence Theorem for groups. The user mentions that they studied group theory a year ago but still struggle with understanding the proof steps. They want an explanation in an easy-going manner, focusing on how the steps follow each other rather than the full proof.\n\nLooking at the problem statement: The theorem states that if G is a group and N is a normal subgroup of G, then there's a bijection between the subgroups of G containing N and the subgroups of G/N. The user is asking for an explanation of the steps involved in establishing this bijection, emphasizing the logical flow rather than the proof itself.\n\nNow, applying the required format. The assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. Here, the key points are:\n\n1. G is a group.\n2. N is a normal subgroup of G (N⊴G).\n3. The subgroups A of G that contain N.\n4. The subgroups of G/N are of the form A/N.\n\nThe problem is to explain the steps establishing the bijection between these sets of subgroups. The user isn't asking for the proof, just the sequence of steps.\n\nI need to ensure that each assumption is listed separately. Let me check again. The problem mentions G is a group, N is normal in G, subgroups A containing N, and the correspondence with A/N in G/N. Each of these should be separate assumptions.\n\nSo, the formatted assumptions would be:\n\n- G is a group.\n- N is a normal subgroup of G.\n- A is a subgroup of G.\n- A contains N.\n- The quotient group G/N has subgroups of the form A/N.\n\nWait, the last point might be part of the problem statement rather than an assumption. Let me re-examine. The theorem states there's a bijection between subgroups of G containing N and subgroups of G/N. So the existence of subgroups A/N in G/N is part of the conclusion, not the assumption. Therefore, the assumptions should only include the given conditions before the bijection is established.\n\nThus, the correct assumptions are:\n\n- G is a group.\n- N is a normal subgroup of G.\n- A is a subgroup of G.\n- A contains N.\n\nBut wait, in the theorem, A ranges over all subgroups of G that contain N. So maybe the assumptions should be:\n\n- G is a group.\n- N is a normal subgroup of G.\n- Consider the set of subgroups A of G such that A contains N.\n- Consider the set of subgroups of the quotient group G/N.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address only one property applied to one object. So breaking it down:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n1. G is a group.\n2. N is a normal subgroup of G (N⊴G).\n3. A is a subgroup of G.\n4. Subgroup A contains N.\n5. The quotient group G/N is considered.\n\nWait, but the quotient group G/N is a consequence of N being normal. Maybe the fifth point is redundant. Alternatively, perhaps the problem's assumptions are just G is a group and N is a normal subgroup. Then the problem is to establish the bijection between the two sets: subgroups of G containing N and subgroups of G/N.\n\nBut the example given in the user's instruction had specific assumptions like n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So each assumption is a single condition on one object. In this case:\n\n- G is a group.\n- N is a normal subgroup of G.\n- A is a subgroup of G that contains N.\n- The quotient group G/N has subgroups of the form A/N.\n\nBut perhaps the last two are part of the problem's setup. Wait, the problem statement is to show the bijection exists. So the assumptions are G is a group, N is normal in G. The rest are part of the problem's context. So the user's original problem states that there's a bijection from the set of subgroups A of G containing N onto the set of subgroups A/N of G/N. So the assumptions are:\n\n- G is a group.\n- N is a normal subgroup of G.\n- A is a subgroup of G.\n- A contains N.\n\nBut the problem is to establish the bijection. So perhaps the assumptions are only the first two, and the rest are part of the problem statement. Wait, in the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Then the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. So in the current case, the assumptions would be:\n\n- G is a group.\n- N is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nThen the problem is to show there's a bijection between the set of subgroups A of G containing N and the set of subgroups of G/N. However, the user's original question includes \"the set of subgroups A of G that contain N\" as part of the problem statement. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- G is a group.\n- N is a normal subgroup of G.\n- A is a subgroup of G containing N.\n- The quotient group G/N has subgroups denoted by A/N.\n\nWait, but \"A/N\" is a notation, not an assumption. Alternatively, the problem is about the correspondence between two sets: subgroups of G containing N and subgroups of G/N. So the assumptions are G is a group and N is normal. The rest is part of the problem.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumptions:\n- G is a group.\n- N is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there is a bijection from the set of subgroups A of G that contain N onto the set of subgroups A/N of the quotient group G/N.\n\nBut the user's original question says \"there is a bijection from the set of subgroups A of G that contain N onto the set of subgroups $\\overline{A} = A/N$ of $G/N$.\" So the problem is to establish that bijection.\n\nWait, but the user isn't asking for the proof, just the steps. So the problem is to explain the steps in establishing the bijection. However, according to the format, the \"Problem\" section should state the mathematical problem, not the request for explanation. The original example's problem was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" So here, the problem is \"Prove that there is a bijection between the set of subgroups A of G containing N and the set of subgroups A/N of G/N.\"\n\nBut maybe the problem is better phrased as in the original question: \"there is a bijection from the set of subgroups A of G that contain N onto the set of subgroups $\\overline{A} = A/N$ of $G/N$.\" So the problem is to show that this bijection exists.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- G is a group.\n- N is a normal subgroup of G.\n- A is a subgroup of G.\n- A contains N.\n\nBut the last two are part of the problem's context. Wait, in the example, the assumptions were about the variable n. Here, the variables are G, N, and A. So perhaps:\n\nAssumptions:\n- G is a group.\n- N is a normal subgroup of G.\n- A is a subgroup of G containing N.\n\nBut the problem is to establish the bijection between all such A and the subgroups of G/N. So maybe the assumptions are only G is a group and N is normal. The rest is part of the problem statement.\n\nLooking back at the example:\n\nOriginal problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted assumptions were that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So the assumptions were about the variables involved. In the current problem, the variables are G, N, and A. The theorem's hypotheses are G is a group, N is normal in G. The subgroups A are those containing N. So the assumptions should be:\n\n- G is a group.\n- N is a normal subgroup of G.\n- A is a subgroup of G containing N.\n\nBut the problem is to establish the bijection between these A and the subgroups of G/N. However, the problem statement as given in the original question is already phrased as the bijection existing between these sets. Therefore, the problem is to prove that this bijection exists. So the assumptions are the conditions needed for the theorem to hold, which are G is a group and N is normal. The other conditions (A is a subgroup containing N) are part of the sets involved in the bijection.\n\nThus, the correct assumptions are:\n\n- G is a group.\n- N is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nProblem: Prove that there is a bijection from the set of subgroups A of G that contain N onto the set of subgroups A/N of the quotient group G/N.\n\nBut wait, the user's original problem statement includes \"the set of subgroups A of G that contain N\" and \"the set of subgroups A/N of G/N\". So in the assumptions, perhaps we need to list that A is a subgroup of G containing N, and A/N is a subgroup of G/N. But those are part of the problem's statement, not assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, the assumptions are the given conditions, and the problem is the conclusion. The theorem's hypotheses are G is a group, N is normal in G. The conclusion is the bijection exists. So the assumptions are G is a group and N is normal, and the problem is to prove the bijection between the specified sets.\n\nTherefore, formatted as:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a group,\nN is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there is a bijection from the set of subgroups A of G that contain N onto the set of subgroups A/N of the quotient group G/N.\n\nYes, that seems correct. The key assumptions are G being a group and N being normal. The problem is about the bijection between the two sets of subgroups.",
