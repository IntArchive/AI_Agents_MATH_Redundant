    "Content": "Let $X$ be a simplicial set. Recall that we can associate to it a certain topological space, the geometric realization , given by $ | X | = \\int ^{n \\in \\Delta} X_{n} \\times \\Delta _{n} \\simeq (\\bigsqcup X_{n} \\times \\Delta _{n}) / \\sim$, where on the right hand side we quotient out by both the degeneracy and face maps. In fact, this functor is a part of Quillen equivalence between spaces and simplicial sets. There is a related construction, that of the fat geometric realization (where I hope I got the terminology right), given by $ || X || = \\int ^{n \\in \\Delta _{+}} X_{n} \\times \\Delta _{n} \\simeq (\\bigsqcup X_{n} \\times \\Delta _{n}) / \\sim$, where $\\Delta _{+} \\subseteq \\Delta$ is the category of non-empty finite ordinals and injective , order-preserving maps. On the right hand side this amounts to saying that we only quotient out by the face maps. Hence, there is a natural map $|| X || \\rightarrow |X|$. I am looking for a reference for the fact that this map is a weak\n  equivalence. I would be ideally interested in a direct argument that does not use the homotopy theory of simplicial sets, but maybe that's asking too much. I got interested in this statement while thinking of the different ways of proving that weak equivalences of spaces induce isomorphisms in singular homology (this is well-known and there is a direct argument in the textbook of Hatcher). This is obvious for cellular homology, where cellular homology of a general topological space would be cellular homology of some CW-approximation. It seems to me that cellular complex of $| Sing (X) |$ for some space $X$ is very close, but not quite the singular complex of $X$. On the other hand, I believe the cellular complex of $|| Sing (X) ||$ might be exactly the right thing.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This is proven in Appendix A of Segal's \" Categories and cohomology theories \".  In particular, it is Proposition A.1(iv).  Note that in terms of that appendix, a simplicial set is a particular instance of a simplicial space, and it always satisfies the \"goodness\" criterion described in A.4 which guarantees that the natural map $||X|| \\to |X|$ is an equivalence. In your situation, $||X||$ and $|X|$ are both CW-complexes, and so it is also a homotopy equivalence. Note that in A.5 there are some equivalence signs that are hard to see. You are correct that the cellular chain complex of $||Sing(X)||$ is the standard chain complex computing $H_*(X)$.  The cellular chain complex of $|Sing(X)|$ is a direct summand of it, and the complementary summand (the complex of degenerate simplices) always has trivial homology.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this Math Stack Exchange question. The user is asking about the fat geometric realization of a simplicial set and whether the natural map from the fat geometric realization to the usual geometric realization is a weak equivalence. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The question mentions a simplicial set X. So that's one assumption. Then, they define the geometric realization |X| using the standard formula with quotienting by both face and degeneracy maps. The fat geometric realization ||X|| is defined similarly but only quotienting by face maps, using non-empty ordinals and injective order-preserving maps. The natural map from ||X|| to |X| is considered. The main problem is to find a reference that this map is a weak equivalence or provide a direct argument.\n\nLooking at the example provided, each assumption should be a single condition on one object. So here, the key objects are X as a simplicial set, the definitions of |X| and ||X||, and the natural map between them. The assumptions would include the structure of the geometric realizations and the properties of the categories involved (Δ vs Δ₊). \n\nWait, the problem states \"Let X be a simplicial set.\" So that's the first assumption. Then, the definitions of |X| and ||X|| involve specific constructions. However, the example given in the original problem only listed assumptions about the variables involved. In this case, the simplicial set X is given, and the constructions are part of the problem statement. Maybe the assumptions here are the conditions under which the map is a weak equivalence. But the user is asking to prove that the natural map is a weak equivalence in general, so perhaps the only assumption is that X is a simplicial set. \n\nBut the problem as phrased in the user's example includes the divisibility by 7 as an assumption, even though the original problem didn't state it. Wait, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted version added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect? Wait, let me check. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. So perhaps the user's example is wrong, but the instruction here is to follow the example's structure.\n\nBut the user might have made a mistake in their example. Let me see: the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That changes the problem. Wait, maybe that was a different problem? Wait, the example given by the user might not be accurate. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instructions. \n\nIn this case, the task is to structure the problem as in the example, listing assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So for the current problem:\n\nAssumptions would include:\n\n- X is a simplicial set.\n\n- The geometric realization |X| is constructed as the coend over Δ, quotienting by face and degeneracy maps.\n\n- The fat geometric realization ||X|| is constructed as the coend over Δ₊, quotienting only by face maps.\n\n- The natural map ||X|| → |X| exists.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that this natural map is a weak equivalence.\n\nBut the example only listed two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, n was any integer, but the formatted problem added the divisibility by 7. That might be a mistake. However, the user might have intended that. So perhaps in their example, they extracted the hidden assumptions. Wait, but in the original problem, A(n) is claimed to be divisible by 91 for every integer n. But 91 is 7*13. The formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which seems incorrect. Maybe there's a misunderstanding. Perhaps the example was supposed to show how to extract assumptions from the problem, but maybe the user made an error. \n\nBut regardless, the task is to structure the current problem by listing assumptions line by line. Let's focus on the problem at hand. The user is talking about a simplicial set X. The geometric realization |X| is defined with quotienting by both face and degeneracy maps, while the fat realization ||X|| only quotients by face maps. The natural map from ||X|| to |X| exists. The problem is to prove this map is a weak equivalence. \n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- X is a simplicial set.\n\n- |X| is the geometric realization defined as the coend over Δ with quotienting by face and degeneracy maps.\n\n- ||X|| is the fat geometric realization defined as the coend over Δ₊ with quotienting only by face maps.\n\n- The natural map ||X|| → |X| is induced by the inclusion Δ₊ → Δ.\n\nBut maybe each assumption should be a separate line. For example:\n\nAssumption:\n\nX is a simplicial set,\n\n|X| is constructed as the coend ∫^{n ∈ Δ} X_n × Δ_n,\n\n||X|| is constructed as the coend ∫^{n ∈ Δ₊} X_n × Δ_n,\n\nThe natural map ||X|| → |X| is induced by the inclusion Δ₊ → Δ,\n\nThe problem is to prove that ||X|| → |X| is a weak equivalence.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps each line is about a single property. For example:\n\nAssumption:\n\nX is a simplicial set,\n\n|X| is the geometric realization defined as a coend over Δ,\n\n||X|| is the fat geometric realization defined as a coend over Δ₊,\n\nThe natural map ||X|| → |X| exists,\n\nΔ₊ is the category of non-empty finite ordinals and injective order-preserving maps.\n\nBut the problem is to prove the natural map is a weak equivalence. So perhaps the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem statement. The user didn't mention any specific conditions beyond X being a simplicial set and the definitions of |X| and ||X||. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- X is a simplicial set,\n\n- The geometric realization |X| is constructed by quotienting by both face and degeneracy maps,\n\n- The fat geometric realization ||X|| is constructed by quotienting only by face maps,\n\n- The natural map ||X|| → |X| is induced by the quotient projection.\n\nBut I need to make sure each assumption is one line, one property. Let's see:\n\nAssumption:\n\nX is a simplicial set,\n\n|X| is the coend ∫^{n ∈ Δ} X_n × Δ_n,\n\n||X|| is the coend ∫^{n ∈ Δ₊} X_n × Δ_n,\n\nThe category Δ includes all finite ordinals and non-decreasing maps,\n\nThe category Δ₊ includes only non-empty finite ordinals and injective order-preserving maps,\n\nThe geometric realization |X| quotients out by face and degeneracy maps,\n\nThe fat geometric realization ||X|| quotients out only by face maps,\n\nThere exists a natural map ||X|| → |X|.\n\nProblem: Prove that the natural map ||X|| → |X| is a weak equivalence.\n\nBut perhaps some of these are part of the problem statement and not assumptions. The example given in the user's prompt included assumptions that were part of the problem. For instance, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That suggests that maybe the user wants to extract implicit assumptions. But in the current problem, the user is stating the problem as given. The user might have made a mistake in their example, but we need to follow the format.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example was a bad example. Maybe the original problem didn't assume n divisible by 7, but the formatted problem incorrectly added it. But regardless, following the user's instructions, we need to list all assumptions from the problem. In the current problem, the user is stating that X is a simplicial set, defines |X| and ||X||, and asks about the map between them. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- X is a simplicial set,\n\n- The geometric realization |X| is defined as a quotient by face and degeneracy maps,\n\n- The fat geometric realization ||X|| is defined as a quotient by face maps only,\n\n- The natural map ||X|| → |X| is considered.\n\nThe problem is to prove that this map is a weak equivalence.\n\nBut in the example, even though the original problem didn't mention n divisible by 7, the formatted version added it. That suggests that perhaps the user wants to extract necessary conditions from the problem. But in the given problem about simplicial sets, there are no hidden conditions; the user is asking for a general proof. Therefore, the assumptions should be the given conditions: X is a simplicial set, the constructions of |X| and ||X||, and the existence of the map. Therefore, the formatted problem would have assumptions about X being a simplicial set, the definitions of the realizations, and the natural map existing. However, the example's structure might be different, so I need to adjust accordingly.\n\nPerhaps the key is to list all the conditions given in the problem as separate assumptions. So:\n\nAssumption:\n\nX is a simplicial set,\n\n|X| is the geometric realization defined as ∫^{n ∈ Δ} X_n × Δ_n,\n\n||X|| is the fat geometric realization defined as ∫^{n ∈ Δ₊} X_n × Δ_n,\n\nΔ is the category of finite ordinals and non-decreasing maps,\n\nΔ₊ is the subcategory of Δ with non-empty ordinals and injective order-preserving maps,\n\nThe construction of |X| involves quotienting by face and degeneracy maps,\n\nThe construction of ||X|| involves quotienting only by face maps,\n\nThere is a natural map ||X|| → |X| induced by the inclusion Δ₊ → Δ.\n\nProblem: Prove that the natural map ||X|| → |X| is a weak equivalence.\n\nBut each assumption should be one line. So breaking it down:\n\nAssumption:\n\nX is a simplicial set,\n\n|X| is the geometric realization defined as a coend over Δ,\n\n||X|| is the fat geometric realization defined as a coend over Δ₊,\n\nΔ is the category of finite ordinals and non-decreasing maps,\n\nΔ₊ is the subcategory of non-empty finite ordinals and injective order-preserving maps,\n\nThe coend for |X| quotients by face and degeneracy maps,\n\nThe coend for ||X|| quotients only by face maps,\n\nThe inclusion Δ₊ → Δ induces a natural map ||X|| → |X|.\n\nBut perhaps some of these can be combined. For example, the definitions of |X| and ||X|| include the coend and the quotienting. But the example listed each assumption line by line. So I think the correct way is:\n\nAssumption:\n\nX is a simplicial set,\n\n|X| is constructed as the coend ∫^{n ∈ Δ} X_n × Δ_n,\n\n||X|| is constructed as the coend ∫^{n ∈ Δ₊} X_n × Δ_n,\n\nThe category Δ consists of finite ordinals and non-decreasing maps,\n\nThe category Δ₊ consists of non-empty finite ordinals and injective order-preserving maps,\n\nIn the construction of |X|, we quotient by both face and degeneracy maps,\n\nIn the construction of ||X||, we quotient only by face maps,\n\nThe natural map ||X|| → |X| arises from the inclusion Δ₊ → Δ.\n\nProblem: Prove that the natural map ||X|| → |X| is a weak equivalence.\n\nBut maybe some of these are part of the problem statement rather than assumptions. The user is asking to structure the problem by filtering unrelated information. So perhaps the key assumptions are that X is a simplicial set, the definitions of |X| and ||X|| as specified, and the existence of the natural map. The rest about Δ and Δ₊ might be part of the problem's context but not assumptions per se. However, the example included an assumption about n being an integer and n divisible by 7, which were part of the problem's conditions. In this case, the problem states \"Let X be a simplicial set,\" which is the primary assumption. The definitions of |X| and ||X|| are part of the problem setup. The natural map is given. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\nX is a simplicial set,\n\nThe geometric realization |X| is constructed as the quotient by face and degeneracy maps,\n\nThe fat geometric realization ||X|| is constructed as the quotient by face maps only,\n\nThe natural map ||X|| → |X| exists.\n\nProblem: Prove that the natural map ||X|| → |X| is a weak equivalence.\n\nThis seems more aligned with the example, where the problem was reformulated with the necessary assumptions listed. The example had the original problem stating \"for every integer n\" but added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which seems incorrect. However, perhaps the user intended that, so we need to follow suit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the example was a bad example, and the correct approach is to list the conditions given in the problem. Since the problem says \"Let X be a simplicial set,\" that's the main assumption. The rest are definitions. But according to the example, even definitions can be considered assumptions. For example, in the example, the definition of A(n) was part of the problem, but the assumption listed was about n. So perhaps in this case, the assumptions are:\n\n- X is a simplicial set,\n\n- The geometric realization |X| is defined as in the standard construction,\n\n- The fat geometric realization ||X|| is defined as in the described construction,\n\n- The natural map ||X|| → |X| exists.\n\nBut the problem is to prove the map is a weak equivalence. I think this is the best way to structure it, following the example's format even if the example had issues.",
