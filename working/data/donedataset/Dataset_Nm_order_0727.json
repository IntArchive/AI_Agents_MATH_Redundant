    "Content": "Let $A$ be an $n\\times n$ positive definite matrix. Show that there exists a unique positive definite matrix $B$ such that $B^2=A$. I do know the existence. But what about the uniqueness? Would you help me out? Thank you.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Suppose $B_1=UDU^\\ast$ and $B_2=V\\Lambda V^\\ast$ are two positive definite square roots of $A$, where $U$ and $V$ are unitary and $D,\\Lambda$ are positive diagonal matrices. Since both $D$ and $\\Lambda$ contain the positive square roots of the eigenvalues of $A$, the two matrices must be permutation similar. Therefore, by absorbing some appropriate permutation matrices into $U$ and $V$, we may assume WLOG that $D=\\Lambda=(\\lambda_1 I_{k_1})\\oplus\\cdots\\oplus(\\lambda_r I_{k_r})$, where $\\lambda_1,\\ldots,\\lambda_r$ are distinct. Now the equality $B_1^2=B_2^2$ implies that $D$ commutes with $W=V^\\ast U$. Hence $W$ must be a block diagonal matrix whose partitioning conforms to the block structure of $D$. But then $WDW^\\ast=D$ and hence $B_1=UDU^\\ast=VWDW^\\ast V^\\ast=VDV^\\ast=B_2$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to show that there's a unique positive definite matrix B such that B squared equals A, where A is a given positive definite matrix. They already know about existence but are stuck on uniqueness.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what positive definite matrices are. They're symmetric matrices with all positive eigenvalues. Also, their square roots should maintain positive definiteness. The key here is uniqueness. So, how do we usually prove uniqueness in such contexts? Maybe suppose there are two such matrices B and C, both positive definite, satisfying B² = A and C² = A, then show B must equal C.\n\nBut wait, matrices can have multiple square roots in general. However, the positive definite condition probably restricts this. Since A is positive definite, it can be diagonalized: A = PDP⁻¹, where D is diagonal with positive entries. Then, taking the square root of D's entries gives another diagonal matrix, say S, such that S² = D. Then, B = PSP⁻¹ would satisfy B² = A. But is this the only positive definite square root?\n\nUniqueness might come from the fact that the square root of each eigenvalue is unique when considering positive roots. Since B and C must have the same eigenvalues as each other (since they're similar to the same diagonal matrix), and their square roots are uniquely determined by the positive roots of the eigenvalues of A. Therefore, their diagonalizations must coincide, forcing B = C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the spectral theorem. Since A is positive definite, it's Hermitian (symmetric in real case), so it can be written as A = QΛQ⁻¹ where Q is orthogonal and Λ is diagonal. Then, the square root would be Q√Λ Q⁻¹. Since Λ's entries are positive, √Λ is uniquely determined by taking positive square roots. Any other positive definite square root would need to have the same eigenvalues and eigenvectors, hence must be the same matrix.\n\nAnother approach: suppose B and C are both positive definite and B² = C² = A. Then, B and C commute with A because BA = B³ = AB and similarly for C. If B and C commute with each other, then they can be simultaneously diagonalized, which would imply they are the same matrix. Wait, but do B and C necessarily commute? Since B² = C² = A, then B²C² = A² = C²B². Not sure if that leads to BC = CB.\n\nAlternatively, consider the polynomial function. Since B is positive definite, it's diagonalizable with positive eigenvalues. The square root function is operator monotone, so maybe there's a unique such matrix. But I need a more concrete argument.\n\nPerhaps use the Taylor series expansion or some functional calculus. If A is positive definite, then its square root can be expressed as a power series in A, which would be unique. But I'm not sure about that.\n\nWait, maybe look at the minimal polynomial. Since B is positive definite and satisfies B² = A, then B is a root of the polynomial x² - A = 0. But how does that help with uniqueness? If there's only one positive definite root, then uniqueness follows. The key is that the polynomial x² - A might have multiple roots, but only one is positive definite.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that positive definite matrices form a convex cone and that the square root function is injective on this cone. If so, then the inverse exists, making the square root unique.\n\nBut to formalize this, maybe use the spectral theorem again. Let A have eigenvalues λ_i > 0 with eigenvectors v_i. Then B must have eigenvalues sqrt(λ_i) with the same eigenvectors. Since B is positive definite, it's determined uniquely by its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, hence B is unique.\n\nYes, that makes sense. If two positive definite matrices B and C both satisfy B² = A and C² = A, then they must share the same set of eigenvectors as A (since they commute with A). Their eigenvalues must be the square roots of A's eigenvalues, and since we require them to be positive, there's no choice but to take the positive roots. Hence, B and C must coincide.\n\nSo the uniqueness comes from the uniqueness of the positive square roots of the eigenvalues and the shared eigenvectors with A. Thus, the positive definite square root is unique.",
