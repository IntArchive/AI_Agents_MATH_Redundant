    "Content": "Let $f(x)$ be a monic polynomial with integer coefficients all of whose roots have absolute values at most 1. Show that all the nonzero roots of $f(x)$ are roots of unity. A root of unity $\\xi$ is a complex number such that there exists a positive integer $n$ so that $\\xi^n = 1$ . I think it might be useful to let $a_1,\\cdots, a_n$ denote the roots of $f(x)$ . Then define for each positive integer $r, f_r(x)=\\prod_{i=1}^n (x-a_i^r)$ . The coefficients of $f_r(x)$ are bounded, and to see why, observe that the coefficient of $x^{n-j}$ has absolute value equal to $|\\sigma_j (a_1^r,\\cdots, a_n^r)|$ . The latter expression is at most ${n\\choose j}$ since each product of $j$ terms of $a_1^r,\\cdots, a_n^r$ has absolute value at most 1. I think one can then apply the pigeonhole principle somehow.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Since a good proof of this on MathOverflow has already been linked in the comments, I will provide an alternate and original proof. Firstly, note that we may write $f(x)=x^r g(x)$ for some monic $g(x)\\in\\mathbb{Z}[x]$ with no roots at $x=0$ . Let $n=\\deg(g)$ , and let $\\alpha_1,\\cdots,\\alpha_n$ be the roots of $g(x)$ . Define the sequence $$A_k=\\alpha_1^k+\\alpha_2^k+\\cdots+\\alpha_n^k$$ It is a fact that the fixed field of the Galois group of a splitting field of a polynomial in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$ is $\\mathbb{Q}$ , so since $A_k$ is fixed by every automorphism in $\\text{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha_1,\\cdots,\\alpha_n)/\\mathbb{Q})$ , then $A_k\\in\\mathbb{Q}$ . Furthermore, since $\\alpha_i$ are algebraic integers, then so is $A_k$ , and since $A_k$ is also rational, then it must be an integer. (note that this fact can also be proven by combining of Newton's identities and Vieta's formulas) Now, note that since $|\\alpha_i|\\leq 1$ , then $$|A_k|\\leq |\\alpha_1|^k+|\\alpha_2|^k+\\cdots+|\\alpha_n|^k\\leq n$$ Combined with the fact that $A_k$ is an integer, this means that $A_k$ only takes on finitely many values. Writing, $g(x)=x^n-b_{n-1}x^{n-1}-\\cdots-b_1x-b_0$ , we know that $A_k$ satisfies the linear recurrence $$A_k=b_{n-1}A_{k-1}+\\cdots+b_1A_{k-n+1}+b_0A_{k-n}$$ Since $A_k$ satisfies a linear recurrence and takes on only finitely many values, then $A_k$ is periodic with some period $m$ . This means that $A_{mk}=A_0=n$ for all $k\\geq 0$ . Therefore, for $|x|<1$ , we have that \\begin{equation}\n\\begin{split}\n\\frac{n}{1-x}&=\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty nx^k\\\\\n&=\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty A_{mk}x^k\\\\\n&=\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\sum_{i=1}^n \\alpha_i^{mk}x^k\\\\\n&=\\sum_{i=1}^n\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty\\alpha_i^{mk}x^k\\\\\n&=\\sum_{i=1}^n\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha_i^mx}\\\\\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation} and therefore, multiplying both sides by $1-x$ , and taking the limit as $x\\rightarrow 1^-$ , we have that \\begin{equation}\nn=\\lim_{x\\rightarrow 1^-}\\sum_{i=1}^n\\frac{1-x}{1-\\alpha_i^mx}\\\\\n\\end{equation} Notice that if $\\alpha_i$ is an $m$ -th root of unity, then $\\lim\\limits_{x\\rightarrow 1^-}\\frac{1-x}{1-\\alpha_i^mx}=1$ , and otherwise $\\lim\\limits_{x\\rightarrow 1^-}\\frac{1-x}{1-\\alpha_i^mx}=0$ . Combining this with the formula above tells us that $g(x)$ has precisely $n$ roots $\\alpha_i$ which are $m$ -th roots of unity (this is every root of $g(x)$ ). Equivalently, every root of $f(x)=x^r g(x)$ is either $0$ or a root of unity, as desired.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me start by reading through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe title is \"Show that all the nonzero roots of f(x) are roots of unity. (A theorem of Kronecker)\". The question body states: Let f(x) be a monic polynomial with integer coefficients all of whose roots have absolute values at most 1. Show that all the nonzero roots of f(x) are roots of unity. A root of unity ξ is a complex number such that there exists a positive integer n so that ξ^n = 1. The user then provides some thoughts involving defining f_r(x) with roots a_i^r, coefficients bounded, and using the pigeonhole principle.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem mentions f(x) is a monic polynomial, has integer coefficients, all roots have absolute values at most 1. The goal is to show nonzero roots are roots of unity.\n\nSo, breaking down the assumptions:\n\n1. f(x) is a monic polynomial. (Monic means leading coefficient is 1)\n2. f(x) has integer coefficients.\n3. All roots of f(x) have absolute values ≤ 1.\n4. The problem is about nonzero roots; so implicitly, some roots could be zero, but we focus on non-zero ones.\n\nWait, the problem says \"all the nonzero roots... are roots of unity\". So, the zero roots are excluded. So in the assumptions, maybe we need to note that roots can be zero, but the conclusion is about nonzero ones. But the problem statement doesn't explicitly state there are nonzero roots, just that if there are any, they must be roots of unity. So perhaps the assumptions are just the three: monic, integer coefficients, roots ≤1 in absolute value. The fourth point is part of the problem statement, not an assumption.\n\nSo the assumptions should be:\n\n- f(x) is a monic polynomial.\n- f(x) has integer coefficients.\n- All roots of f(x) have absolute values at most 1.\n\nThen the problem is to show that all nonzero roots of f(x) are roots of unity.\n\nBut in the example given by the user, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. Here, f(x) has three properties: monic, integer coefficients, roots bounded by 1. Each should be a separate assumption line.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) is a monic polynomial,\nf(x) has integer coefficients,\nall roots of f(x) have absolute values at most 1.\n\nProblem: Show that all the nonzero roots of f(x) are roots of unity.\n\nNow, the original problem mentions Kronecker's theorem, but the user probably wants the problem structured without extra info. The example given didn't include the user's own thoughts, just the problem. So in the formatted problem, we should exclude the user's ideas (the part starting with \"I think it might be useful...\").\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) is a monic polynomial,\nf(x) has integer coefficients,\nall roots of f(x) have absolute values at most 1.\n\nProblem: Show that all the nonzero roots of f(x) are roots of unity.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is a single line, each applying to one object. Here, all three assumptions are about f(x), but each is a separate property. The example had two assumptions about n: being integer and divisible by 7. Similarly here, three separate properties of f(x).\n\nYes, this seems correct. The user's own reasoning about f_r(x) and coefficients is part of their attempt, which we should exclude when structuring the problem as per the format. The original problem statement in the question is just the first part, before the user's thoughts. So the answer should capture that.",
