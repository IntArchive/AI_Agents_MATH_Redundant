Now let $Ht_1, \\ldots, Ht_m$ be all right cosets, with $t_1 = 1$. For all $i,j$, there is $h_{ij} \\in H$ with $t_i g_j = h_{ij} t_{{k}_{ij}}$, for some $t_{{k}_{ij}}$. It's not hard to prove that $H$ is generated by all the $h_{ij}$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So the problem is about group theory. We have a finitely generated group G and a subgroup H of G with finite index. We need to show that H is also finitely generated.\n\nFirst, let me recall some definitions. A group is finitely generated if there exists a finite set of elements in the group such that every element of the group can be expressed as a combination (under the group operation) of elements from that set. The index of a subgroup H in G is the number of distinct left cosets of H in G, which is finite here.\n\nSince G is finitely generated, let's say it's generated by a finite set S. The index [G:H] is finite, so there are finitely many cosets gH in G. I need to find a finite generating set for H. Maybe I can use the coset representatives somehow?\n\nI remember something about Schreier's lemma, which states that a subgroup of finite index in a finitely generated group is finitely generated. The proof involves constructing generators for H using the generators of G and the coset representatives. Let me try to recall how that works.\n\nSuppose we have a set of coset representatives for H in G. Let's denote these representatives as {g_1, g_2, ..., g_n}, where n is the index [G:H]. Each element in G can be written as some g_i times an element of H. Now, take a generator s from S. When we multiply a coset representative g_i by s, we get an element in some coset g_j H. So, g_i s = g_j h for some h in H. Then h = g_j^{-1} g_i s. This h is an element of H, and perhaps these h's can be used as generators for H.\n\nBut we need to ensure that we have a finite number of such h's. Since there are finitely many coset representatives (n) and finitely many generators in S (say m), then for each generator s in S and each coset representative g_i, we get an element h_{i,s} = g_j^{-1} g_i s. The total number of these h's would be n*m, which is finite. Then, according to Schreier's lemma, these h_{i,s} generate H. Therefore, H is finitely generated.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that this process actually works. Let me check with a simple example. Suppose G is the integers under addition, which is generated by {1}. Let H be 2Z, which has index 2. The coset representatives can be 0 and 1. Applying Schreier's method: for each coset rep g_i and generator s, compute h = g_j^{-1} (g_i + s). For g_i=0 and s=1: 0 +1 =1, which is in the coset 1 + H. So h = 1^{-1}*(0 +1) = -1 +1 =0? Wait, maybe I messed up the group operation here because we are in additive notation. Let me adjust.\n\nIn additive groups, the operation is addition. So if G is Z, H is 2Z, coset reps are 0 and 1. For generator s=1. For each coset rep g_i:\n\ng_i + s = 0 +1 =1, which is in coset 1 + H. So the corresponding h would be (1) - (g_j) where g_j is the coset rep for the result. Wait, in additive notation, the inverse is negative. So h = g_j^{-1} (g_i + s) becomes (-g_j) + (g_i + s). Since the result g_i + s is in the coset g_j + H, then there exists h in H such that g_i + s = g_j + h. Therefore, h = (g_i + s) - g_j. So the h's are (g_i + s) - g_j, which in this case, for g_i=0, s=1, the result is 1 which is in coset 1 + H. So g_j=1, hence h = (0 +1) -1 =0. For g_i=1, s=1: 1+1=2, which is in coset 0 + H (since 2 is in 2Z). So g_j=0, hence h=2 -0=2, which is in H. Therefore, the generators would be 0 and 2. But 0 is trivial, and 2 generates 2Z. So it works. So in this case, H is generated by 2, which is finite.\n\nTherefore, Schreier's lemma works here. So the key idea is that when you have a finite index subgroup in a finitely generated group, you can use the coset representatives and the original generators to construct a finite set of generators for the subgroup.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the problem can be solved by applying Schreier's lemma. Therefore, the answer is to use the lemma to construct the generators, showing that H is finitely generated.",
