    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to know why, if two fractions a/b and c/d are equal, then the fraction formed by adding their numerators and denominators, (a+c)/(b+d), is also equal to the original ratio. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the assumptions here. The main condition given is that a/b = c/d. But I should check if there are any implicit assumptions. For instance, the denominators b and d must be non-zero to have valid fractions. Also, when adding b and d, their sum (b + d) shouldn't be zero either, otherwise the new fraction would be undefined. So, the assumptions should include that b ≠ 0, d ≠ 0, and b + d ≠ 0. However, since the problem is presented as a general case, maybe these are considered given. The original example uses 1/2 = 2/4, and 2 + 4 is 6, which is valid. So, perhaps the user assumes that the denominators and their sum are non-zero.\n\nNow, the problem statement is to prove that (a + c)/(b + d) equals a/b (which is equal to c/d). Let me think about how to approach this. Since a/b = c/d, let's call this common ratio k. So, a = k*b and c = k*d. Then, substituting into (a + c)/(b + d) gives (k*b + k*d)/(b + d) = k*(b + d)/(b + d) = k, provided b + d ≠ 0. That makes sense. So the key steps are expressing a and c in terms of b and d using the common ratio, then simplifying.\n\nBut the user might not be familiar with variable substitution, so maybe explaining it through cross-multiplication. If a/b = c/d, then ad = bc. Then, consider (a + c)/(b + d). To show this equals a/b, cross-multiply: (a + c)*b = a*(b + d). Expanding both sides: ab + bc = ab + ad. Since ad = bc from the original equality, this simplifies to ab + bc = ab + bc, which is true. Hence, the equality holds.\n\nAnother way is to think of the fractions as equivalent and adding the numerators and denominators proportionally. But the algebraic proof seems straightforward. The critical assumptions are the equality of the two fractions and the non-zero denominators. So in structuring the problem, the assumptions would include that a/b = c/d, and that b, d, and b + d are non-zero. Each of these should be separate lines in the assumptions. \n\nWait, the original problem didn't mention the denominators not being zero. But in mathematical problems, when dealing with fractions, it's standard to assume denominators are non-zero. However, since the user's example uses 2 and 4 as denominators, which are non-zero and sum to 6, perhaps we should explicitly state the assumptions to cover all bases. So, the problem's structured version should list each assumption separately: a/b = c/d, b ≠ 0, d ≠ 0, and b + d ≠ 0. Each of these is a separate condition on the variables involved. That way, the proof can proceed without division by zero issues.",
