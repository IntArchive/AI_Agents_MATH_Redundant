    "Content": "I learned the following theorem about the properties of permutation from Gallian's Contemporary Abstract Algebra . Theorem 5.4 $\\;$ Always Even or Always Odd If a permutation $\\alpha$ can be expressed as a product of an even number of $2$-cycles, then every decomposition of $\\alpha$ into a product of $2$-cycles must have an even number of $2$-cycles. In symbols, if\n  $$\n  \\alpha = \\beta_1 \\beta_2 \\dotsm \\beta_r\n  \\quad\\text{and}\\quad\n  \\alpha = \\gamma_1 \\gamma_2 \\dotsm \\gamma_s\n$$\n  where the $\\beta$'s and the $\\gamma$'s are $2$-cycles, then $r$ and $s$ are both even or both odd. When I tried to reconstruct the proof myself, I found that it suffices to prove the following lemma: If $\\epsilon=\\beta_1\\beta_2\\cdots\\beta_r$ where $\\beta$'s are $2$-cycles, then $r$ is even. The original proof for this lemma uses the following key property of the product of $\\beta_1\\beta_2$: The product can always be expressed in one of the following forms on the left:\n  $$\\begin{align}(ab)(ab)&=\\epsilon\\\\\n(ab)(ac)&=(bc)(ab)\\\\\n(ab)(cd)&=(cd)(ab)\\\\\n(ab)(bc)&=(bc)(ac)\\end{align}$$ The proof for the lemma is based on such property and mathematical induction. I found it really hard to remind of such property, so I set it as an exercise to give another proof. However, I have no idea how to actually do it. So here is my question : Does anybody know an alternative proof of the lemma or the theorem?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here's a nice proof that uses group actions. Let $x_1,\\ldots,x_n$ be $n$ unknowns, and consider $$\\Delta= \\prod_{1\\leq i\\lt j\\leq n} (x_j-x_i).$$ For example, for $n=4$ , we would have $$\\Delta = (x_2-x_1)(x_3-x_1)(x_4-x_1)(x_3-x_2)(x_4-x_2)(x_4-x_3).$$ Given a permutation $\\sigma\\in S_n$ , define a function $f_{\\sigma}\\colon \\{\\Delta,-\\Delta\\} \\to \\{\\Delta,-\\Delta\\}$ by letting $$f_{\\sigma}(\\Delta) = \\prod_{1\\leq i\\lt j\\leq n} (x_{\\sigma(j)}-x_{\\sigma(i)}),$$ and $f_{\\sigma}(-\\Delta)=-f_{\\sigma}\\Delta$ . Note that since $\\sigma$ is a permutation, $f_{\\sigma}(\\Delta)=\\Delta$ or $f_{\\sigma}(\\Delta) = -\\Delta$ . Also, if $\\sigma,\\rho$ are two permutations, then $f_{\\sigma}\\circ f_{\\rho} = f_{\\sigma\\rho}$ , as is easy to verify. Now, let's consider what a transposition $\\tau=(a,b)$ does to $\\Delta$ . Without loss of generality, say $a\\lt b$ . The factors $(x_j-x_i)$ with neither $i$ nor $j$ equal to $a$ nor $b$ are unchanged. For the pairs with exactly one index in $\\{a,b\\}$ , we have two classes: those in which the other index is between $a$ and $b$ , and those where the other index is not between $a$ and $b$ . If the other index is between $a$ and $b$ , then $x_j-x_a$ is sent to $-(x_b-x_j)$ and $x_b-x_j$ is sent to $-(x_j-x_a)$ ; the two sign changes cancel each other out. If the other index is larger than $b$ , then $x_j-x_a$ and $x_j-x_b$ are swapped, with no sign changes. If the other index is smaller than $a$ , then $x_a-x_i$ and $x_b-x_i$ are swapped, with no sign changes. Finally, the factor $x_b-x_a$ is sent to $-(x_b-x_a)$ . In summary, if $\\tau$ is a transposition, then $f_{\\tau}(\\Delta)=-\\Delta$ , $f_{\\tau}(-\\Delta)=\\Delta$ . Now take an arbitrary permutation $\\sigma$ , and express it as a product of transpositions in two different ways: $$\\sigma = \\tau_1\\cdots \\tau_r = \\rho_1\\cdots\\rho_s.$$ Then $$f_{\\sigma}(\\Delta) = f_{\\tau_1\\cdots\\tau_r}(\\Delta) = f_{\\tau_1}\\circ\\cdots\\circ f_{\\tau_r}(\\Delta) = (-1)^r\\Delta$$ and $$f_{\\sigma}(\\Delta) = f_{\\rho_1\\cdots\\rho_s}(\\Delta) = f_{\\rho_1}\\circ\\cdots\\circ f_{\\rho_s}(\\Delta) = (-1)^s\\Delta.$$ Therefore, $(-1)^r\\Delta = (-1)^s\\Delta$ , so $r$ and $s$ have the same parity: both odd, or both even.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. The user wants an alternative proof of the lemma that if the identity permutation ε can be expressed as a product of r transpositions (2-cycles), then r must be even. The standard proof uses those specific properties of transposition products, which the user finds hard to remember. So we need another approach.\n\nHmm, maybe there's a different way to look at it. Let me think about what other properties permutations have. Oh, right, the parity of a permutation is related to the number of inversions. But wait, how does that connect to transpositions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the sign of a permutation, which is a homomorphism to {±1}. Each transposition has a sign of -1, so if you compose r transpositions, the total sign is (-1)^r. If the product is the identity (which has sign +1), then (-1)^r = 1, which implies r is even. That seems straightforward. But does this count as an alternative proof, or does it rely on the theorem itself?\n\nWait, the sign homomorphism is usually defined using the number of transpositions, but perhaps we can define it independently. For example, using the determinant of a permutation matrix, which is the sign. The determinant of a transposition is -1. So composing r transpositions would give determinant (-1)^r. If the permutation is the identity, determinant is 1, so r must be even. This approach doesn't rely on the decomposition properties but instead on linear algebra. That might be an alternative proof.\n\nBut does defining the sign via determinant count as a different proof? The user probably wants a group-theoretic proof without invoking linear algebra. Alternatively, maybe using the concept of the alternating group. Wait, but the existence of the sign homomorphism is essentially equivalent to the theorem in question. So perhaps that's circular.\n\nAnother approach: consider the number of fixed points. No, that might not directly help. Or maybe using the action of permutations on polynomials. For example, define a polynomial P = product_{i < j} (x_i - x_j). Then a transposition swaps two variables, which changes the sign of P. So each transposition multiplies P by -1. If a permutation σ is a product of r transpositions, then σ(P) = (-1)^r P. If σ is the identity, then σ(P) = P, so (-1)^r = 1, hence r is even. That's another way using the effect on polynomials. This is similar to the sign homomorphism but framed differently.\n\nThis might be an acceptable alternative proof. Let me check if this is valid. The key is that each transposition changes the sign of P, so composing r transpositions gives a factor of (-1)^r. Since the identity permutation leaves P unchanged, we must have (-1)^r = 1, so r is even. This doesn't rely on the decomposition properties but instead on the action on the polynomial. That seems like a valid alternative proof. The user might be looking for something like this.\n\nSo the problem is to provide an alternative proof of the lemma that if the identity permutation is written as a product of r transpositions, then r is even. The assumptions would then include that ε is the identity permutation, it's expressed as a product of r transpositions, and we need to show r is even. The answer could use the polynomial argument or the sign homomorphism defined via determinants or polynomial actions.",
