    "Content": "In the process of touching up some notes on infinite series, I came across the following \"result\": Theorem: For an ordered field $(F,<)$ , the following are equivalent: (i) Every Cauchy sequence in $F$ is convergent. (ii) Absolutely convergent series converge: $\\sum_n |a_n|$ converges in $F$ $\\implies$ $\\sum_n a_n$ converges in $F$ . But at present only the proof of (i) $\\implies$ (ii) is included, and unfortunately I can no longer remember what I had in mind for the converse direction.  After thinking it over for a bit, I wonder if I was confusing it with this result: Proposition: In a normed abelian group $(A,+,|\\cdot|)$ , the following are equivalent: (i) Every Cauchy sequence is convergent. (ii) Absolutely convergent series converge: $\\sum_n |a_n|$ converges in $\\mathbb{R}$ $\\implies$ $\\sum_n a_n$ converges in $A$ . For instance, one can use a telescoping sum argument, as is done in the case of normed linear spaces over $\\mathbb{R}$ in (VIII) of this note . But the desired result is not a special case of this, because by definition the norm on a normed abelian group takes values in $\\mathbb{R}^{\\geq 0}$ , whereas the absolute value on an ordered field $F$ takes values in $F^{\\geq 0}$ . I can show (ii) $\\implies$ (i) of the Theorem for ordered subfields of $\\mathbb{R}$ .  Namely, every real number $\\alpha$ admits a signed binary expansion $\\alpha = \\sum_{n = N_0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\epsilon_n}{2^n}$ , with $N_0 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\epsilon_n \\in \\{ \\pm 1\\}$ , and the associated \"absolute series\" is $\\sum_{n=N_0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^n} = 2^{1-N_0}$ . Because an ordered field is isomorphic to an ordered subfield of $\\mathbb{R}$ iff it is Archimedean, this actually proves (ii) $\\implies$ (i) for Archimedean ordered fields.  But on the one hand I would prefer a proof of this that does not use the (nontrivial) result of the previous sentence, and on the other hand...what about non-Archimedean ordered fields? Added : The article based on this question and answer has at last appeared: Clark, Pete L.; Diepeveen, Niels J.;\nAbsolute Convergence in Ordered Fields.\nAmer. Math. Monthly 121 (2014), no. 10, 909–916. If you are a member of the MAA, you will be frustrated if you try to access it directly: the issue is currently advertised on their website but the articles are not actually available to members.  The article is available on JSTOR and through MathSciNet.  Anyway, here is an isomorphic copy .  Thanks again to Niels Diepeveen!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Proving this for arbitrary ordered fields is a little\ntrickier than for Archimedean fields, partly because\nthere are no concrete sequences -- other than eventually\nconstant ones -- that are guaranteed to converge or\neven to be Cauchy sequences and partly because we lack\nthe embedding in a completely ordered field. These problems can be overcome by constructing all the\nnecessary sequences and series from the one Cauchy\nsequence we assume to exist. To begin with, note two\nimportant facts. First, for a Cauchy sequence to\nconverge, it is sufficient that some subsequence\nconverges. Second, any sequence has a strictly increasing\nsubsequence, a strictly decreasing subsequence or a\nconstant subsequence. For this problem, the latter\ncase is trivial and the first two can be reduced to each\nother by negation, so we need to prove only one of them. Let $K$ be an ordered field in which every absolutely\nconvergent series is convergent. If $\\{a_n\\}$ is a strictly\nincreasing Cauchy sequence in $K$, then $\\{a_n\\}$ converges. Proof: Let $b_n = a_{n+1} - a_n$. Then ${b_n}$ is positive and\nconverges to $0$, so it has a strictly decreasing\nsubsequence $\\{b_{n_k}\\}$.\nLet $c_k = b_{n_k} - b_{n_{k+1}}$. We now have a convergent\nseries with positive terms $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty c_k = b_{n_1}$.\nAs $\\{a_n\\}$ is a Cauchy sequence, it has a subsequence $\\{a_{m_k}\\}$\nsuch that $a_{m_{k+1}} - a_{m_k} < c_k$ for all $k$. Now consider the series $\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty d_i$ where\n$d_{2k-1} = a_{m_{k+1}} - a_{m_k}$ and\n$d_{2k} = a_{m_{k+1}} - a_{m_k} - c_k$.\nNote that $-c_k < d_{2k} < 0 < d_{2k-1} < c_k$, so we can pair off\nterms to get\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty |d_i| = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty (d_{2k-1} - d_{2k})\n  = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty c_k = b_{n_1}\n$$\nBy the hypothesis on $K$ we may conclude that $\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty d_i$\nconverges and\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty d_i + \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty c_k\n  = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty (d_{2k-1} + d_{2k} + c_k)\n  = 2 \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty (a_{m_{k+1}} - a_{m_k}).\n$$\nBecause a Cauchy sequence with a convergent subsequence converges,\nwe have\n$$\n\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} a_n = a_{m_1} + \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty (a_{m_{k+1}} - a_{m_k})\n  = a_{m_1} + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(b_{n_1} + \\sum_{i=1}^\\infty d_i \\right)\n$$ To the question \"how did I come up with this?\": there are\nnot many things that could possibly work. The problem is\nset in an environment where none of the power tools of\nanalysis work. Basic arithmetic works, inequalities work,\nsome elementary properties of sequences and series work, but\nif you want to take a limit of something it'd better be\nconvergent by hypothesis or by construction. One more or less obvious attack is by contraposition: assume\nthat there is a divergent Cauchy sequence and try to construct\na divergent, absolutely convergent series. Such a series\nmust be decomposable into a positive part $a$ and a negative\npart $b$, where $a+b$ diverges and $a-b$ converges. This\nis possible in several ways by taking $a$ and $b$ to be linear\ncombinations of known convergent and divergent series. A complication is that the terms of the convergent series\nmust dominate those of the divergent series, as they must\ncontrol the signs. I wasted a lot of time trying to get the\nconvergent series to do this, which is very hard, perhaps\nimpossible. Then I turned to the proof for vector spaces\nfor inspiration, and saw that it was in fact very easy to\nadjust the divergent series instead, as the partial sums\nare a Cauchy sequence. I also adopted the\noverall structure of that proof, which is why the final\nversion is not by contraposition.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let's start by reading through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe title is \"In which ordered fields does absolute convergence imply convergence?\" The user is discussing a theorem about ordered fields where two conditions are equivalent: (i) every Cauchy sequence converges, and (ii) absolute convergence implying convergence. The user mentions they have a proof for (i) implies (ii) but are stuck on (ii) implies (i), especially for non-Archimedean ordered fields.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem is about ordered fields, so the main object here is an ordered field (F, <). The theorem states two conditions are equivalent. The user is focusing on proving (ii) implies (i), so the problem is to show that in an ordered field where absolutely convergent series converge, every Cauchy sequence is convergent.\n\nNow, the assumptions. The key points are:\n\n1. The field in question is an ordered field (F, <).\n2. For this field, absolutely convergent series converge. That is, if the series of absolute values converges in F, then the original series converges in F.\n\nBut wait, the original problem is asking in which ordered fields does this implication hold. The user is seeking to prove the equivalence, so the problem is to show that (ii) implies (i), i.e., if every absolutely convergent series converges, then the field is Cauchy complete (every Cauchy sequence converges). So the assumptions would be that we have an ordered field where (ii) holds, and we need to show (i) follows.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should include that F is an ordered field, and that in F, any series that is absolutely convergent (i.e., the series of absolute values converges in F) must itself converge in F. The problem is to prove that under these assumptions, every Cauchy sequence in F converges.\n\nWait, but the user also mentions that they can prove this for Archimedean ordered fields (subfields of R) using signed binary expansions, but are stuck on non-Archimedean cases. However, in the problem statement, the user is asking for the general case. So perhaps the original problem's assumption is just that F is an ordered field where absolute convergence implies convergence, and the problem is to show that such F must be Cauchy complete.\n\nSo, structuring this:\n\nAssumption: \n- (F, <) is an ordered field.\n- For every series ∑a_n in F, if ∑|a_n| converges in F, then ∑a_n converges in F.\n\nProblem:\nProve that every Cauchy sequence in F converges in F.\n\nBut I need to check the example given. The example had specific assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the key assumptions are about the ordered field and the absolute convergence implying convergence. So each assumption should be a single condition applied to one object.\n\nThus, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. (F, <) is an ordered field.\n2. Every absolutely convergent series in F converges in F.\n\nProblem: Prove that every Cauchy sequence in F converges in F.\n\nBut the user's original problem is titled \"In which ordered fields does absolute convergence imply convergence?\" So the problem is to characterize the ordered fields where (ii) implies (i). But the user's specific question is about proving (ii) ⇒ (i), given the ordered field. So the problem as structured is to show that in an ordered field where absolute convergence implies convergence, the field is Cauchy complete.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have those two assumptions and the problem statement as proving Cauchy completeness.\n\nLet me double-check the original problem's statement. The theorem is that (i) and (ii) are equivalent. The user has (i) implies (ii) but needs to show (ii) implies (i). So the problem is, given an ordered field where (ii) holds, prove (i). So the assumptions are (F, <) is an ordered field, and (ii) holds. The problem is to prove (i), which is that every Cauchy sequence converges.\n\nHence, the correct formatting is:\n\nAssumption:\n- (F, <) is an ordered field.\n- For every series ∑a_n in F, if ∑|a_n| converges in F, then ∑a_n converges in F.\n\nProblem:\nProve that every Cauchy sequence in F converges in F.\n\nYes, that seems right. The key is that each assumption is a separate line, each addressing one property. The first line is the structure of the field, the second is the condition on absolute convergence. The problem is then to show Cauchy completeness.",
