    "Content": "I have to prove that: If $X,Y$ be Banach Spaces, and $T\\in B(X,Y)$ is a compact operator, then $T(X)$ is closed in $Y$ if and only if $\\dim T(X)<\\infty$ . Can anybody help me with this proof, please? There is surely some property I haven't thought about, but I'm getting really weird right now... Thank you!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $Z=T(X)$. Then $Z$ is also a Banach space, as a closed subspace of a Banach space, and $T:X\\to Z$ is onto, and hence open, due to Open Mapping Theorem. If $Z$ were infinite dimensional, then $T$ would not be compact, as open sets in infinite dimensional spaces are not pre-compact.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format with assumptions and the problem statement. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original problem carefully. The question is about proving that a compact operator between Banach spaces has a closed range if and only if the range is finite-dimensional. The original problem mentions that X and Y are Banach spaces, T is a compact operator in B(X,Y), and then the equivalence to prove is that T(X) is closed iff dim T(X) is finite.\n\nNow, I need to extract the assumptions. The format requires each assumption to address one property or condition applied to one object. Let's list the components:\n\n1. X is a Banach space.\n2. Y is a Banach space.\n3. T is an element of B(X,Y), which means T is a bounded linear operator.\n4. T is a compact operator.\n5. The problem is an \"if and only if\" statement, so there are two directions to consider. But the assumptions are the premises given for both directions. The problem is to show the equivalence between T(X) being closed and dim T(X) being finite.\n\nWait, the original question states \"then T(X) is closed in Y if and only if dim T(X) < ∞\". The user might have included an extra assumption? Let me check the original problem again. The user wrote: \"If X,Y be Banach Spaces, and T∈B(X,Y) is a compact operator, then T(X) is closed in Y if and only if dim T(X)<∞.\" So the assumptions here are that X and Y are Banach spaces, T is in B(X,Y) (so bounded linear), and T is compact. The problem is to prove the equivalence between the range being closed and the range being finite-dimensional.\n\nSo each of these should be separate assumptions. So each line in the assumption section should be one condition. So:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a Banach space,\nY is a Banach space,\nT is an element of B(X,Y),\nT is a compact operator.\n\nProblem: Prove that T(X) is closed in Y if and only if dim T(X) < ∞.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"T(X) is closed in Y if and only if dim T(X)<∞\". So that's the problem statement.\n\nBut in the example given by the user, they had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. However, in the original problem here, there are no additional conditions beyond X, Y being Banach, T being compact and in B(X,Y). So those four points are the assumptions.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is one line, one property per object. So for example, \"X and Y are Banach spaces\" would be two separate assumptions: \"X is a Banach space\", \"Y is a Banach space\". Similarly, \"T is an element of B(X,Y)\" and \"T is a compact operator\" are two separate conditions on T.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the assumptions are:\n\n- X is a Banach space,\n- Y is a Banach space,\n- T is a bounded linear operator from X to Y,\n- T is a compact operator.\n\nProblem: Prove that T(X) is closed in Y if and only if dim T(X) < ∞.\n\nI think that's all. Let me check again. The original problem doesn't mention any other conditions, so those four assumptions are correct. The problem is the equivalence between closed range and finite-dimensional range. That should be the formatted problem.",
