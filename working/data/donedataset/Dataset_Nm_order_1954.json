    "AcceptedAnswer": "Lemma. Let $n$ be an integer  $\\ge 1000$. Then there exists a positive integer $m$ such that $m<n$, $n-m$ is a multiple of $999$ and for the decimal digit sums, we have $q(m)\\le q(n)$. Proof. $n$ has a $k$-digit decimal expansion $n=\\overline{a_ka_{k-1}\\ldots a_1}$ (with $k\\ge 4$ and $a_k\\ge1$), then $m:=n-999\\cdot 10^{k-4}$ is non-negative and has a decimal expansion  $m=\\overline{b_kb_{k-1}\\ldots b_1}$, where $b_j=a_j$ for all $j$ except\n$$\\begin{cases}b_k=a_k-1,b_{k-3}=a_{k-3}+1&\\text{if }a_{k-3}<9\\\\\nb_k=a_k-1,b_{k-3}=0, b_{k-2}=a_{k-2}+1&\\text{if }a_{k-2}<a_{k-3}=9\\\\\nb_k=a_k-1,b_{k-2}=b_{k-3}=0, b_{k-1}=a_{k-1}+1&\\text{if }a_{k-1}<a_{k-2}=a_{k-3}=9\\\\\nb_{k-1}=b_{k-2}=b_{k-3}=0&\\text{if }a_{k-1}=a_{k-2}=a_{k-3}=9\\\\\n\\end{cases} $$\nThen for the digit sum of $m$ we find accordingly\n$$q(m)=\\begin{cases}q(n)\\\\q(n)-9\\\\q(n)-18\\\\q(n)-27\\end{cases}\\le q(n) $$\nHence if $m>0$, the claim follows.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So the claim is that any multiple of 999 has a digit sum of at least 27. Hmm. Let me start by understanding what's being asked here. \n\nFirst, let's consider some examples. For k=1, 999*1=999, and the digit sum is 9+9+9=27. For k=2, 999*2=1998, which is 1+9+9+8=27. For k=3, 2997, digit sum 2+9+9+7=27. Wait, but when k=4, it's 3996, sum is 3+9+9+6=27. Similarly up to k=9, it's 8991, sum is 8+9+9+1=27. So for k=1 to 9, the digit sums are exactly 27. Then k=10, 999*10=9990, digit sum 9+9+9+0=27. Wait, the user said they checked up to k=9 and that if it's true for d, it's true for 10*d. Let me check k=11: 999*11=10989, sum is 1+0+9+8+9=27. k=12: 11988, sum 1+1+9+8+8=27. Hmm, seems consistent. But wait, what about larger k? Let's try k=100: 999*100=99900, sum 9+9+9+0+0=27. Still 27. But wait, if k=111: 999*111=110,889. Let's see: 1+1+0+8+8+9=27. Still 27. Wait, is it possible that all multiples of 999 have a digit sum of exactly 27? But the problem says \"≥27\", which suggests that sometimes it's higher. Let me check a larger k. Let's try k=123. 999*123. Let me compute that: 999*100=99,900; 999*20=19,980; 999*3=2,997. So adding those: 99,900 +19,980=119,880 +2,997=122,877. Sum the digits: 1+2+2+8+7+7=27. Still 27. Hmm. What about k=999: 999*999=998,001. Digit sum: 9+9+8+0+0+1=27. Wait, still 27. Is there any k where the digit sum is higher than 27? Wait, maybe when there's a carryover that affects more digits. Let's try k=1999: 999*1999. Let's compute that. 999*2000=1,998,000 minus 999 gives 1,997,001. Digit sum: 1+9+9+7+0+0+1=27. Still 27. Hmmm. Maybe the digit sum is always exactly 27? But the problem states \"≥27\". Maybe I'm missing something. Let's check k=1001: 999*1001=999,999. Digit sum: 9*6=54. Wait, 999*1001=999,999. So that's 9+9+9+9+9+9=54. Oh! So here's a case where the digit sum is 54, which is greater than 27. So why didn't I notice this before? Because when k is a multiple of 1001, which is 7*11*13, but maybe k=1001 is allowed. So in that case, the digit sum is 54. So the problem says \"the sum of the digits of k⋅999 is ≥27\". So in this case, 54 is indeed ≥27. So the minimal digit sum is 27, but sometimes it's higher. So the claim is that no multiple of 999 has a digit sum less than 27. So the problem is to prove that for any positive integer k, the digit sum of 999k is at least 27.\n\nThe user also mentions that the digit sum must be a multiple of 9, which makes sense because 999 is a multiple of 9 (since 9+9+9=27, which is divisible by 9), and any multiple of 9 will have a digit sum that's a multiple of 9. So the possible digit sums are 27, 36, 45, etc. But how to show that it's at least 27?\n\nLet me think about the structure of multiples of 999. Any multiple of 999 can be written as 999k = 1000k - k. For example, 999*2 = 2000 - 2 = 1998, which matches. So in general, 999k = 1000k - k. This seems like a useful representation because subtracting k from 1000k can be thought of in terms of digit manipulation, especially when considering carries in base 10.\n\nLet's consider how the subtraction 1000k - k affects the digits. If we write k as a number, say, in decimal digits as d_n d_{n-1} ... d_1 d_0, then 1000k would be shifting those digits three places to the left, i.e., appending three zeros. Then subtracting k would mean subtracting the original digits from the last three digits of 1000k. But since 1000k has zeros in the last three digits, subtracting k would require borrowing. For example, take k=123: 1000*123=123000, subtract 123 gives 122877. Let's see how the borrowing works here. The last three digits are 000 - 123. To subtract, we need to borrow from the fourth digit. So the 3rd digit (from the right) becomes 10, but since it's 0, we have to borrow from the next higher digit. This creates a chain of borrowing. Let's work through this example:\n\n1000*123 = 123000\nSubtract 123:\nStart from the rightmost digit: 0 - 3. Can't do that, borrow 1 from the next digit. But that digit is 0, so we have to borrow from the next non-zero digit. The fourth digit from the right is 3 (in 123000), so we borrow 1 from there, making it 2, and the third digit becomes 10. Then, borrowing from the third digit (now 10) to the second: the second digit becomes 9, and the first digit becomes 10. Then subtract:\n\nFirst digit (units place): 10 - 3 = 7\nSecond digit (tens place): 9 - 2 = 7\nThird digit (hundreds place): 9 - 1 = 8\nThe fourth digit (thousands place) is now 2 instead of 3.\nSo the result is 122877, which matches 123000 - 123 = 122877.\n\nThis borrowing process seems to create a series of 9s in the digits where the subtraction occurs. Let's generalize this. When we subtract k from 1000k, the last three digits of 1000k are 000. Subtracting k's digits (which could be up to three digits) would require borrowing, leading to a chain of 9s in the result. For example, if k has m digits, then 1000k would have m+3 digits, and subtracting k would affect the last three digits and potentially create leading digits that are reduced by 1, with intermediate digits becoming 9s. The exact number of 9s depends on the number of leading zeros in k when written with leading zeros to make it three digits. Wait, maybe not. Let's take another example: k=5. Then 1000*5=5000, subtract 5 gives 4995. The digits here are 4,9,9,5. The digit sum is 4+9+9+5=27. Similarly, k=9: 9000-9=8991, sum 8+9+9+1=27. For k=10: 10000-10=9990, sum 9+9+9+0=27. So in each case, when we subtract k from 1000k, the result is a number where the digits are (1000k's digits minus 1 in the thousands place) followed by some 9s and then the subtraction result. The key point is that the subtraction process introduces a certain number of 9s into the digit representation, which contribute significantly to the digit sum.\n\nLet me consider how many 9s are introduced. If k is a three-digit number, then 1000k is k followed by three zeros. Subtracting k would give a number that is (k-1) followed by 999 - (k's last three digits). Wait, no. Let me take k=123 again. 1000*123=123000. Subtract 123: 123000 - 123 = 122877. Here, the thousands digit decreases by 1 (from 3 to 2), and the last three digits become 877, which is 1000 - 123 = 877. Wait, but 1000 - 123 = 877, yes. So in general, if k has up to three digits, then 999k = 1000k - k will have the last three digits as 1000 - k, and the thousands digit and above are k-1. But if k has more than three digits, this pattern changes. For example, take k=1234. Then 1000k=1,234,000. Subtract k=1234 gives 1,234,000 - 1,234 = 1,232,766. The digit sum here is 1+2+3+2+7+6+6=27. Wait, that's 27. Another example: k=9999. 1000*9999=9,999,000. Subtract 9999: 9,999,000 - 9,999 = 9,989,001. Digit sum: 9+9+8+9+0+0+1=36. Wait, that's 36, which is greater than 27. So here's a case where the digit sum is higher. But the problem states that it's at least 27. So the digit sum can be 27 or higher. So the key is to show that in any case, the digit sum cannot be less than 27.\n\nBut how to formalize this? Let's think in terms of the subtraction process. When you subtract k from 1000k, you have to borrow from the fourth digit, which propagates through the digits as needed. Each borrow turns a 0 into 9, which contributes 9 to the digit sum. For example, if k has n digits, then 1000k has n+3 digits, and subtracting k affects the last three digits and possibly introduces more 9s in the digits beyond the third from the end. Let's consider different cases based on the number of digits in k.\n\nCase 1: k is a 1-digit number (1 to 9). Then 1000k is a 4-digit number: k followed by three zeros. Subtracting k gives a number where the thousands digit is k-1, and the last three digits are 1000 - k. For example, k=1: 1000 -1=999, so 0999 (but since it's 1000*1 -1=999, which is three digits). Wait, no. Wait, k=1: 1000*1=1000, subtract 1 gives 999. Digit sum 9+9+9=27. Similarly, k=2: 2000-2=1998, sum 1+9+9+8=27. So in these cases, the digit sum is exactly 27.\n\nCase 2: k is a 2-digit number (10 to 99). Let's take k=10: 1000*10=10,000. Subtract 10: 9990. Digit sum 9+9+9+0=27. k=11: 1000*11=11,000 -11=10,989. Sum 1+0+9+8+9=27. Similarly, k=99: 1000*99=99,000 -99=98,901. Sum 9+8+9+0+1=27.\n\nCase 3: k is a 3-digit number (100 to 999). For example, k=123: 123,000 -123=122,877. Sum 1+2+2+8+7+7=27. k=999: 999,000 -999=998,001. Sum 9+9+8+0+0+1=27.\n\nCase 4: k is a 4-digit number (1000 to 9999). Let's take k=1000: 1,000,000 -1000=999,000. Sum 9+9+9+0+0+0=27. k=1234: 1,234,000 -1234=1,232,766. Sum 1+2+3+2+7+6+6=27. Wait, that adds up to 1+2=3, +3=6, +2=8, +7=15, +6=21, +6=27. Yes. Another example: k=9999: 9,999,000 -9999=9,989,001. Sum 9+9+8+9+0+0+1=36. Oh, here the sum is 36. So how does that happen? Let's see: 9,989,001. The digits are 9 (millions place), 9 (hundred thousands), 8 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 0 (hundreds), 0 (tens), 1 (units). So 9+9+8+9+0+0+1=36. So here, the digit sum is higher. But it's still ≥27.\n\nSo, the key seems to be that when you subtract k from 1000k, the borrowing process introduces a certain number of 9s into the digits, and those 9s contribute significantly to the digit sum. The minimal case occurs when exactly three 9s are introduced, leading to a digit sum of 27. But when more 9s are introduced, the digit sum increases.\n\nNow, how to generalize this? Let's analyze the subtraction 1000k - k. Let's represent k in decimal digits as k = d_n d_{n-1} ... d_1 d_0, where d_n is the most significant digit. Then 1000k is the digits of k followed by three zeros: d_n d_{n-1} ... d_1 d_0 0 0 0. Subtracting k from this would require subtracting the digits of k starting from the three zeros. Since the last three digits of 1000k are zeros, subtracting the last three digits of k (if k has at least three digits) would require borrowing. However, if k has more than three digits, the borrowing would propagate through the higher digits.\n\nLet me formalize this. Suppose k has m digits. Then 1000k has m+3 digits: the original m digits followed by three zeros. Subtracting k would affect the last m digits of 1000k. Specifically, the subtraction would be:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit (units place), subtract k's digits. However, since 1000k has three trailing zeros, the subtraction would be:\n\n... d_2 d_1 d_0 0 0 0\n-           d_2 d_1 d_0 (assuming k is three digits)\n\nWait, but if k has m digits, then we have to subtract the digits of k from the last m digits of 1000k. Wait, no. If k has m digits, then 1000k has m+3 digits. When we subtract k, we need to align the digits properly. For example, if k=123 (three digits), 1000k=123000 (six digits). Subtracting k=123 would subtract from the last three digits, but since the last three digits are 000, we have to do 000 - 123, which requires borrowing from the fourth digit (the '3' in 123000). This turns the fourth digit from 3 to 2, and the last three digits become 1000 - 123 = 877. So the result is 122877.\n\nFor a k with m digits, 1000k has m+3 digits. Subtracting k would subtract from the digits starting at the third position from the end. Wait, let's think in terms of place values. 1000k shifts k three places to the left, so the units place of k becomes the thousands place in 1000k. Therefore, subtracting k (which is in the units place) from 1000k (which is in the thousands place) requires adjusting the digits accordingly. This would cause a borrow to propagate through the digits.\n\nLet me try to model this. Let’s consider the subtraction process step by step for a general k. When subtracting k from 1000k, we need to subtract each digit of k from the corresponding digit in 1000k three places to the left. For example, the units digit of k is subtracted from the thousands digit of 1000k, the tens digit of k from the ten-thousands digit of 1000k, etc. However, this is not exactly accurate because subtraction is done digit-wise aligned by place value. Wait, no. Actually, when you write 1000k - k, it's equivalent to k*(1000 - 1) = 999k, which is the original problem. But to see the digit manipulation, perhaps it's better to think of 1000k as k shifted three places left, and then subtracting k from that.\n\nLet’s take k as a number with digits D = d_{n}d_{n-1}...d_1d_0. Then 1000k is D followed by three zeros: d_{n}d_{n-1}...d_1d_0 0 0 0. Subtracting k from this would mean subtracting d_0 from the fourth digit from the right (which is a zero), d_1 from the fifth digit from the right (also a zero), and so on. This would require borrowing from the higher digits. Each time we subtract a digit d_i from a zero, we have to borrow 1 from the next higher digit, turning it into 9, and the current digit becomes 10 - d_i. However, if the next higher digit is also zero, we have to borrow from the next non-zero digit, turning all the intermediate zeros into 9s.\n\nThis borrowing process creates a sequence of 9s in the digits of 999k. The number of 9s created depends on the number of trailing zeros in k. Wait, maybe not trailing zeros, but the position where the borrow happens. For example, if k has m digits, then the subtraction affects the digits starting at the (m+3)th digit down to the third digit from the end. The exact number of 9s introduced depends on how many leading digits in the shifted k (i.e., 1000k) are non-zero and how the borrowing propagates.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider that each borrow propagates through the zeros introduced by the shift, converting them into 9s. For example, if k has m digits, then 1000k has m+3 digits. When we subtract k, we need to subtract each digit of k from the corresponding digit in 1000k three places to the left. However, since those positions are zeros, borrowing is required, which converts those zeros into 9s. The number of 9s created would be at least three (for the three zeros), but if k has more digits, the borrowing might propagate further.\n\nWait, let's take k=1001 (four digits). Then 1000k=1001000. Subtracting k=1001 gives 1001000 - 1001 = 999,999. Here, the subtraction would require borrowing from the fourth digit (the 1 in 1001000), but since the next digits are zeros, borrowing propagates through three zeros, converting them to 9s, and the fourth digit becomes 0. The result is 999,999, which has six 9s. The digit sum is 54. So in this case, the number of 9s introduced is equal to the number of digits in k plus the three zeros minus some adjustment. But I need a better way to count this.\n\nAlternatively, note that 999k = 1000k - k. Let's express 1000k - k in terms of carries. The subtraction can be written as:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n- Units place: 0 - d_0. Can't do that, borrow 1 from the thousands place.\n- Thousands place: d_0 - 1 (after borrowing) then subtract d_0. Wait, this seems messy. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nAnother angle: since 999 = 9*111, and 111 is the number with three 1s. But I'm not sure if that helps directly. Alternatively, consider that multiplying by 999 is equivalent to multiplying by 1000 and subtracting the original number, as we've been doing.\n\nLet’s think about the digit sum. The digit sum of a number is congruent to the number modulo 9. Since 999 is divisible by 9, any multiple of 999 will also be divisible by 9, so its digit sum must be a multiple of 9. The smallest multiple of 9 that's ≥27 is 27 itself. Therefore, to prove that the digit sum is at least 27, we need to show that it can't be 9 or 18.\n\nSuppose, for contradiction, that there exists some k such that the digit sum of 999k is 9 or 18. Let's see if that's possible.\n\nTake digit sum 9: the smallest digit sum possible for a multiple of 999. But 999 itself has digit sum 27, and any smaller multiple would have to be 999 divided by a common factor, but 999 factors into 27*37, so the only smaller multiples would be fractions, not integers. Wait, but k must be a positive integer, so the minimal multiple is 999 itself, which already has digit sum 27. Therefore, there are no smaller positive integer multiples of 999 with digit sum less than 27. Wait, but this reasoning is circular. Because the problem is to prove that for any k≥1, 999k has digit sum ≥27. The key is that the minimal digit sum occurs at k=1, which is 27, and for larger k, the digit sum can't be smaller. But how to formalize that?\n\nPerhaps using induction. Assume that for some k, 999k has digit sum ≥27. Then 999(k+1) = 999k + 999. Adding 999 to a number can either increase the digit sum or decrease it due to carries. For example, adding 999 to a number that ends with 001 would result in 1000, which reduces the digit sum. But in this case, since we're dealing with multiples of 999, maybe there's a pattern. However, this approach might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, consider the representation of 999k as 1000k - k. Let's analyze the digit sum of 1000k - k. Since 1000k is just k shifted three places left, its digit sum is the same as the digit sum of k. When we subtract k from 1000k, the digit sum changes based on the borrowing that occurs. Each borrow reduces a digit by 1 and increases a lower digit by 10, which affects the digit sum by -1 + 1 + 0 (since 10 in the lower digit contributes 1 to the digit sum, and the higher digit was reduced by 1). Wait, actually, when you borrow, you subtract 1 from a digit and add 10 to the next lower digit. So the digit sum changes by (-1) + (+10) for the two digits involved. However, if the digit you borrowed from was originally d, then it becomes d-1 (contributing (d-1) - d = -1 to the digit sum), and the next digit becomes 10 + original digit minus the subtracted digit. Wait, this is getting too complicated.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to consider the number of carries that occur during the subtraction 1000k - k. Each carry propagates through the zeros introduced by the shift, converting them to 9s. The number of 9s created in this process contributes 9 each to the digit sum. Let's try to count the minimum number of 9s.\n\nWhen k has m digits, then 1000k has m+3 digits. Subtracting k requires borrowing from the (m+3)th digit down to the third digit. The number of 9s created would be at least three, because we're subtracting from three zeros. However, if k has more digits, the borrowing might propagate further. For example, if k is 1000 (four digits), then 1000k is 1,000,000. Subtracting 1000 gives 999,000. Here, three 9s are introduced in the thousands, ten thousands, and hundred thousands places. The digit sum is 9+9+9+0+0+0=27. If k is 1001, then 1000k=1,001,000. Subtracting 1001 gives 1,001,000 - 1,001 = 999,999. Here, six 9s are created, sum 54. So the number of 9s depends on how many digits are borrowed through. \n\nIn general, the subtraction process will convert a certain number of zeros into 9s, and the remaining digits will be adjusted accordingly. The key insight is that each borrow propagates through the zeros, converting them into 9s, and each 9 contributes 9 to the digit sum. To achieve a digit sum of 27, we need at least three 9s (3*9=27). If more 9s are introduced, the digit sum increases. Therefore, the minimal digit sum is 27, which occurs when exactly three 9s are created during the subtraction. This happens when k is such that the borrowing does not propagate beyond the three zeros. For example, when k is a three-digit number, subtracting it from 1000k (which is k followed by three zeros) results in three 9s and the remaining digits adjusted by the subtraction. However, when k has more digits, the borrowing might create more 9s, leading to a higher digit sum.\n\nTo formalize this, we can consider that in the subtraction 1000k - k, the number of trailing zeros in 1000k is three. Subtracting k requires borrowing through these three zeros, converting them into 9s, and adjusting the higher digits. The three 9s contribute 27 to the digit sum. Any additional digits in k beyond three will cause further borrowing, creating more 9s and thus increasing the digit sum beyond 27. Therefore, the digit sum of 999k is at least 27.\n\nWait, but when k has more than three digits, like k=1000, the subtraction results in 999,000, which has three 9s and three zeros. The digit sum is 27. So why isn't there more borrowing? Because k=1000 has four digits, and when you subtract 1000 from 1,000,000, you get 999,000. Here, the subtraction affects the fourth digit from the end (the 1 in 1,000,000 becomes 0, and the next three digits become 9s). Wait, but 1,000,000 - 1000 = 999,000. The digits are 9,9,9,0,0,0. The digit sum is 27. So here, even though k has four digits, we still end up with three 9s. How does that happen?\n\nLet's break it down. k=1000. 1000k=1,000,000. Subtract k=1000:\n\nStart from the rightmost digit:\n\n0 - 0 = 0\n0 - 0 = 0\n0 - 0 = 0\n0 - 1 (thousands place). Can't do that, so borrow 1 from the next higher digit (the 1 in the millions place). That digit becomes 0, and the thousands place becomes 10. Then subtract 1 from 10, getting 9. The remaining digits are 0. So the result is 999,000. Digit sum 9+9+9=27.\n\nAh, so even when k has more than three digits, the borrowing only affects the thousands place and converts the three zeros into 9s. The higher digits are reduced by 1, but if they were 1, they become 0, and no further 9s are introduced. So in this case, only three 9s are created, leading to digit sum 27. So when does the digit sum exceed 27? Let's take k=1001. 1000k=1,001,000. Subtract k=1001:\n\nStart from the rightmost digit:\n\n0 - 1. Can't do that, borrow from thousands place. Thousands place is 1 (from 1,001,000), so becomes 0, and the units place becomes 10. Now subtract 1: 10 -1=9.\n\nNext digit (tens place): 0 - 0=0.\n\nNext digit (hundreds place): 0 - 0=0.\n\nThousands place: 0 (after borrowing) - 1. Can't do that, need to borrow from next higher digit. The next higher digit is 0 (ten-thousands place), so we need to borrow from the hundred-thousands place, which is 0, then from the millions place, which is 1. The millions place becomes 0, the hundred-thousands and ten-thousands places become 9, and the thousands place becomes 10. Now subtract 1: 10 -1=9.\n\nThe remaining digits: 0 (millions place), 9 (hundred-thousands), 9 (ten-thousands), 9 (thousands), 0 (hundreds), 0 (tens), 9 (units). So the number is 999,009. Wait, but wait, let's do the actual subtraction:\n\n1,001,000\n-     1001\n= ?\n\nAligning them:\n\n1,001,000\n-     1,001\n= 999,999\n\nWait, my previous step-by-step was incorrect. Let's compute it properly:\n\n1,001,000 minus 1,001:\n\nStart from the rightmost digit:\n\n0 - 1. Can't do. Borrow from the thousands place (which is 1). So thousands place becomes 0, and units place becomes 10. 10 -1=9.\n\nNext digit (tens place): 0 - 0=0.\n\nNext digit (hundreds place): 0 - 0=0.\n\nThousands place: 0 (after borrowing) - 1. Can't do. Borrow from the ten-thousands place. But ten-thousands place is 0, so need to borrow from the hundred-thousands place, which is also 0. Finally, borrow from the millions place (1). Millions place becomes 0, hundred-thousands becomes 9, ten-thousands becomes 9, thousands place becomes 10. Now subtract 1: 10-1=9.\n\nThe rest of the digits: hundred-thousands is 9, ten-thousands is 9, thousands is 9, hundreds is 0, tens is 0, units is 9. So the number is 999,999. Digit sum 9*6=54.\n\nAh, so in this case, subtracting k=1001 from 1,001,000 results in 999,999, which has six 9s. The borrowing propagated through three places (millions to thousands), converting three digits into 9s. So here, more than three 9s are created, leading to a higher digit sum.\n\nSo the key seems to be that the number of 9s introduced depends on the number of leading digits that are affected by the borrowing. Each time you have a borrow that propagates through multiple zeros, you convert those zeros into 9s. The minimal case is when exactly three 9s are introduced, giving a digit sum of 27. Any additional 9s from further borrowing increase the digit sum beyond 27.\n\nTherefore, to prove that the digit sum is always at least 27, we need to show that in the subtraction process, at least three 9s are always introduced, contributing 27 to the digit sum. Any remaining digits either contribute 0 or more, thus the total digit sum is at least 27.\n\nBut how to formalize this? Let's consider that when subtracting k from 1000k, the last three digits of 1000k are zeros. Subtracting the last three digits of k (if k has at least three digits) or the entire k (if it has fewer) requires borrowing from the fourth digit. This borrowing turns the last three digits into 1000 - k (if k has three digits) or similar, which results in three 9s if k is small enough. For larger k, the borrowing might propagate further, creating more 9s.\n\nAlternatively, notice that 999k = 1000k - k. The number 1000k has the same digits as k followed by three zeros. When you subtract k, you are effectively subtracting 1 from the fourth digit from the end (since k is being subtracted from the fourth digit onwards). This subtraction can be thought of as decrementing the fourth digit by 1 and adding 999 to the last three digits. For example, if k=5, then 1000*5=5000, subtract 5 gives 5000-5=4995. Here, the fourth digit (5) becomes 4, and the last three digits become 1000 -5=995. The digit sum is 4+9+9+5=27. Similarly, for k=123, 1000k=123000, subtract 123 gives 122877. Here, the fourth digit (3) becomes 2, and the last three digits become 877. The digit sum is 1+2+2+8+7+7=27.\n\nIn general, when you subtract k from 1000k, you decrease the fourth digit by 1 and add 1000 - k to the last three digits. The digit sum contribution from the last three digits is the sum of the digits of (1000 - k). For example, if k is a three-digit number, 1000 - k is a three-digit number (from 001 to 999), and its digit sum plus the decreased fourth digit's contribution must be at least 27.\n\nWait, but how? Let's take k=500. Then 1000k=500,000. Subtract 500 gives 499,500. Digit sum 4+9+9+5+0+0=27. Here, the last three digits are 500, sum 5+0+0=5, and the fourth digit is 9 (from 499,500). Wait, no. The digits are 4 (hundred thousands), 9 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 0 (tens), 0 (units). So sum 4+9+9+5+0+0=27. The last three digits are 500, sum 5. The fourth digit is 9 (thousands place), which is part of the 499,500. Wait, I'm getting confused with place values. Let me correct that.\n\nIn 499,500:\n\nPosition breakdown:\n\n- Hundred thousands place: 4\n- Ten thousands place: 9\n- Thousands place: 9\n- Hundreds place: 5\n- Tens place: 0\n- Units place: 0\n\nSo digit sum 4+9+9+5+0+0=27.\n\nHere, the last three digits (hundreds, tens, units) are 5,0,0. Their sum is 5. The thousands place is 9, ten thousands 9, hundred thousands 4. Sum 4+9+9=22. Total 22+5=27.\n\nBut in this case, the last three digits don't contribute much. However, the key is that the decreased digit (from 5 to 4 in the hundred thousands place) and the introduction of 9s in the ten thousands and thousands places contribute significantly to the digit sum. \n\nThis suggests that when you subtract k from 1000k, you introduce 9s in the places where borrowing occurs, which are the thousands, ten thousands, and hundred thousands places in this example. These 9s contribute 9 each, totaling 18, plus the decreased digit (4) and the remaining digits (5,0,0) sum to 27.\n\nTherefore, the critical point is that the act of subtracting k from 1000k inevitably introduces at least three 9s into the digit sum, either directly in the last three digits or through borrowing in higher digits, ensuring that the total digit sum cannot be less than 27.\n\nTo generalize this, we can argue that in the subtraction 1000k - k, the process of borrowing to subtract k from the shifted number results in at least three 9s being introduced into the digit representation. Each 9 contributes 9 to the digit sum, and the remaining digits contribute at least 0, leading to a minimum digit sum of 3*9 =27. Therefore, the digit sum of 999k must be at least 27.\n\nAnother angle is to use the fact that any number divisible by 999 must have a digit sum that's a multiple of 9. The smallest such multiple is 9, then 18, then 27, etc. However, through our examples, we've seen that the digit sum is never less than 27. This suggests that the structure of 999 as a number composed of three 9s imposes a lower bound on the digit sum. \n\nPerhaps we can use the concept that multiplying by 999 requires a certain amount of \"carryover\" in the digits, which spreads out the digits and increases the sum. For example, multiplying by 999 is akin to multiplying by 1000 and subtracting 1, which distributes the digits in a way that increases their sum. However, this is vague and needs to be made precise.\n\nA more formal approach might involve induction. Let's assume that for all k < N, 999k has a digit sum ≥27. Then consider k=N. If N is a multiple of 10, say N=10m, then 999N = 999*10m = 10*999m. The digit sum of 10*999m is the same as the digit sum of 999m, since multiplying by 10 appends a zero, which doesn't change the digit sum. By the induction hypothesis, the digit sum of 999m is ≥27, so the digit sum of 999N is also ≥27. For N not a multiple of 10, we need to consider how adding 999 affects the digit sum. However, this approach might not cover all cases and requires a solid base case.\n\nAlternatively, consider the number 999k in terms of its base-10 digits. Each digit must satisfy certain constraints because the number is divisible by 999. The divisibility rule for 999 is similar to that for 9: the sum of the digits must be a multiple of 9. However, this alone doesn't give the lower bound of 27. To establish the lower bound, we need to relate the number of digits in 999k to its digit sum. \n\nThe number 999k has approximately the same number of digits as k plus three. The digit sum is minimized when the digits are as small as possible while still forming a multiple of 999. However, due to the subtraction process in 1000k - k, the digits cannot be too small. The minimal case occurs when the digit sum is exactly 27, achieved by k=1 to 999, etc., and any larger k introduces more digits or more 9s, thus increasing the digit sum.\n\nAnother approach is to use the concept of the number's length. The smallest number divisible by 999 is 999 itself, with three digits and digit sum 27. Any larger multiple of 999 must have at least three digits, but due to the carries introduced by multiplication, the digit sum can't decrease below 27. For example, the next number after 999 would be 1998, which has four digits and digit sum 27. This pattern continues, suggesting that the digit sum never drops below 27.\n\nIn summary, the key points are:\n\n1. 999k = 1000k - k, which introduces borrowing and creates 9s in the digit representation.\n2. The borrowing process guarantees at least three 9s, contributing 27 to the digit sum.\n3. Any additional digits from larger k result in more 9s or other digits that can only increase the digit sum.\n4. The minimal digit sum is achieved at k=1, yielding 27, and cannot be lower for any positive integer k.\n\nTherefore, the digit sum of any multiple of 999 is at least 27.",
