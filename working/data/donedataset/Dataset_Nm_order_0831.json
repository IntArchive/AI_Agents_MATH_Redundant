    "Content": "Are there an infinite number of primes \nof the form\n$\\lfloor \\pi n \\rfloor$? This is sort of\na clickbait title.\nI would really like to show that,\nfor any real irrational\n$r > 1$,\nthere are an infinite number of primes\nof the form\n$\\lfloor r n \\rfloor$\nfor positive integer $n$. I can show that\nthere are an\ninfinite number of primes\nof the form\n$\\lfloor r n \\rfloor$\nfor\n$r < 1+1/g$\nfor a fixed $g > 1$,\nbut the best known value\nof $g$\nis $246$ unconditionally\nand\n$6$ assuming\nan unproved conjecture. To prove this,\nI use the idea\nof Beatty sequences\n( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatty_sequence ).\nFor a real $r > 1$,\nlet\n$B(r)\n=\\{\\lfloor nr \\rfloor\n\\mid n \\in \\mathbb{N}^+\\}$.\n($\\mathbb{N}^+$\nis the set of positive integers.)\nThen\nBeatty's theorem states that\n$B(r)$ and\n$B(r/(r-1))$\nmake up a\ndisjoint partition\nof $\\mathbb{N}^+$. If there are\nonly a finite number of primes\nin $B(r)$,\nthen all the primes\nabove a certain value\nare in\n$B(r/(r-1))$. We have\n$\\lfloor (n+1)r \\rfloor\n=\\lfloor nr+r \\rfloor\n\\ge \\lfloor nr \\rfloor +\\lfloor r \\rfloor\n$.\nTherefore,\nif $r > 3$,\n$B(r)$\ncan not contain\nany twin primes.\nTherefore,\nif there are an\ninfinite number of twin primes,\n$B(r/(r-1))$\nmust contain\nan infinite number\nof primes\nfor all \n$r > 3$,\nor\n$r/(r-1)\n\\lt 3/2\n$. The use of\nan unproved conjecture\ncan be removed\nat the cost of\na weaker conclusion\nby using the recent results\non prime gaps\n( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_gap ).\nIt has been shown that\nthere is a constant $g$\nsuch that\nthere are an\ninfinite number of\nconsecutive primes\nthat differ by\nat most $g$. It has been shown that\n$g \\le 246$\nunconditionally\nand that,\nassuming the\nElliott–Halberstam conjecture\n( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott%E2%80%93Halberstam_conjecture ),\n$g \\le 12$\n($g \\le 6$\nassuming a generalized form\nof the conjecture.). Arguing as before,\nif $r > g+1$,\nthen\n$B(r)$\ncan not contain\nall the primes\nabove any finite value.\nFor,\nif it did,\nthere are an\ninfinite numer of\nconsecutive primes\n$p$ and $q$\nsuch that\n$q-p \\le g$,\nand $p$ and $q$\ncan not both be in\n$B(r)$. Therefore\n$B(r/(r-1))$\nmust contain an\ninfinite number of primes\nfor $r > g+1$.\nRestating,\n$B(r)$\nmust contain an\ninfinite number of primes\nfor $r < (g+1)/g\n=1+1/g$. I don't know how to go\nbeyond this.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "There is a conjecture on the least prime in an arithmetic progression that would imply the answer to your question is yes . For coprime positive integers $a$, $d$, write $p(a,d)$ for the smallest prime congruent to $a$ modulo $d$. Conjecture 1 : For every $\\epsilon>0$, the bound $p(a,d) =O_\\epsilon(d^{1+\\epsilon})$ holds for all $a$, $d$. The statement is known to hold if $1+\\epsilon$ is replaced by $5$, and if we assume GRH it is know to hold with $1+\\epsilon$ replaced by $2+\\epsilon$. The conjecture and related results are discussed here . Proof that Conjecture $1$ implies an affirmative answer to your question:. There are infinitely many pairs of coprime positive integers $p$, $q$ such that\n$$\n0<\\frac{p}{q}-r< \\frac{1}{q^2}.\n$$\nFor such $p$, $q$, the integers\n$$\n\\lfloor qr\\rfloor,\\lfloor 2qr\\rfloor,\\ldots,\\lfloor q^2r\\rfloor\n$$\nform an arithmetic progression with initial term $p-1$ and common difference $p$. The largest term is about $p^2/r$, so once $p$ is sufficiently large, one of these terms must be prime. Unconditionally, this argument shows that there are infinitely many primes of the form $\\lfloor rn\\rfloor$ if the irrationality measure $\\mu(r)$ satisfies $\\mu(r)> 5$, and on GRH it is sufficient that $\\mu(r)>2$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original question is about whether there are infinitely many primes of the form ⌊πn⌋, and the user also mentions a more general case with any irrational real number r > 1. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the original problem and extract the assumptions and the main problem statement. The example provided shows that assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. The problem statement should be concise.\n\nLooking at the original question, the main problem is to prove that for any real irrational r > 1, there are infinitely many primes of the form ⌊rn⌋. The user also mentions their own work involving Beatty sequences and some conditions on r related to prime gaps. However, the core problem is the general statement about r > 1, with the example using π as a specific case in the title.\n\nThe assumptions need to be broken down. The key conditions here are that r is a real number, irrational, and greater than 1. Each of these should be a separate assumption. The problem statement then is asking about the infinitude of primes in the form ⌊rn⌋.\n\nThe original question includes a lot of additional context about Beatty sequences, prime gaps, and the user's own attempts, but those are part of their thought process and not the core assumptions of the problem they're posing. So, the filtered assumptions should just include the properties of r. The problem statement is their main question, stripped of the extra details.\n\nSo, the assumptions would be:\n\n- r is a real number.\n- r is irrational.\n- r > 1.\n\nThe problem is: Prove that there are an infinite number of primes of the form ⌊r n⌋ for positive integer n.\n\nI need to check if there's any other assumption mentioned. The user mentions \"for positive integer n\", so maybe that should be an assumption as well. However, since n is a positive integer by the problem's nature (as in the Beatty sequence definition), but the user explicitly states \"for positive integer n\" in the problem. However, in the example given, the assumption was about n being an integer. So perhaps \"n is a positive integer\" should be an assumption. Wait, in the example, the assumption was \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But in the original example, the problem didn't specify n's divisibility, but the formatted problem included it. Wait, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", so the assumption included \"n is an integer\". Then in the example, the formatted problem added an assumption \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Wait, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The user then formatted it with assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect because the original problem's assumption is that n is any integer, but the formatted problem added an extra assumption. Maybe that example was incorrect. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. The original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should just be \"n is an integer\". The formatted problem's assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\", which is an additional condition not present in the original problem. That seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the example is wrong. Because if the original problem is to prove for every integer n, then the assumption is n is an integer. But in the formatted problem, the assumption is n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So that would actually narrow down the problem. Maybe the example is incorrect. But regardless, the user provided that example as how they want the formatting. Therefore, perhaps in their formatting, assumptions include both the general conditions (like n is integer) and any specific conditions (like n divisible by 7). But in the given problem here, the user is asking about primes of the form ⌊πn⌋, but generalizing to any irrational r >1. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- r is a real number.\n\n- r is irrational.\n\n- r > 1.\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user writes \"for positive integer n\". So maybe \"n is a positive integer\" is an assumption. However, in the example provided by the user, the assumption was \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So following that example, perhaps here we need to include \"n is a positive integer\" as an assumption. Let me check the original problem's Beatty sequence definition: B(r) is {⌊nr⌋ | n ∈ ℕ⁺}, so n is a positive integer. So yes, n is a positive integer is part of the problem's setup. Therefore, the assumptions should include:\n\n- r is a real number.\n\n- r is irrational.\n\n- r > 1.\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the assumption was \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". The problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, but in the original problem statement, it's for every integer n. So perhaps the example is structured with redundant assumptions, perhaps the user made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the problem's original statement had a typo. Anyway, according to the user's example, each assumption is one property per line. So for the current problem, the key assumptions are that r is real, irrational, greater than 1, and n is a positive integer. However, in the problem statement, the user says \"for positive integer n\", so perhaps the assumption is that n is a positive integer. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- r is a real number.\n\n- r is irrational.\n\n- r > 1.\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions included both \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", even though the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7. So maybe in that example, the user intended to have the problem under the assumption that n is divisible by 7. Maybe the original problem had a mistake. Anyway, perhaps in this case, the problem is to prove for any real irrational r >1, the infinitude of primes of the form ⌊rn⌋. The user's own work involves Beatty sequences and some conditions, but those are part of their approach, not the problem's assumptions. Therefore, the main assumptions are r is real, irrational, greater than 1, and n is a positive integer. Wait, but n is a variable here. Wait, in the problem statement, we are to consider primes of the form ⌊rn⌋ where n ranges over positive integers. So n is a variable, not a fixed object. So perhaps the assumptions about n are not needed as n is quantified over all positive integers. Therefore, maybe the assumptions are only on r. Let me check the example again. In the example, the problem was about A(n) for every integer n, so the assumption was \"n is an integer\". Here, the problem is about primes of the form ⌊rn⌋ for positive integer n, so perhaps the assumption is \"n is a positive integer\". But in the example, the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So following that, here, the assumptions would be:\n\n- r is a real number.\n\n- r is irrational.\n\n- r > 1.\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the question is about the existence of infinitely many primes of the form ⌊rn⌋ as n varies over positive integers. So n is not a specific object but a variable. Therefore, maybe \"n is a positive integer\" is not an assumption but part of the problem's quantification. However, the example included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So perhaps the user wants all variables mentioned in the problem to have their conditions listed as assumptions. So in the example, the problem was \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is \"n is an integer\". Therefore, in this problem, since it's \"for positive integer n\", the assumption would be \"n is a positive integer\". But maybe the user's example was incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the problem's original statement in the example was miswritten. Anyway, following the user's example, I need to list each assumption as line by line, each addressing one property. So here, the key assumptions are on r: real, irrational, greater than 1. Also, n is a positive integer. Therefore, the formatted assumptions would be these four points.\n\nBut let me check the original problem's exact wording. The user writes: \"I would really like to show that, for any real irrational r >1, there are an infinite number of primes of the form ⌊rn⌋ for positive integer n.\" So the problem is for any real irrational r >1, prove that there are infinitely many primes of the form ⌊rn⌋ where n is a positive integer. Therefore, the assumptions here are on r: real, irrational, >1; and on n: positive integer. So each of these should be separate assumptions. Thus:\n\nAssumption:\nr is a real number,\nr is irrational,\nr > 1,\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that there are an infinite number of primes of the form ⌊r n⌋.\n\nWait, but in the example, the problem was about A(n) being divisible by 91, with assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But the original problem was for every integer n. So the example seems to have added an extra assumption. That suggests that maybe the user made a mistake in the example. But regardless, following the instructions, the task is to filter the unrelated information and structure the problem. The original question's core problem is to show that for any real irrational r >1, there are infinitely many primes of the form ⌊rn⌋ for positive integer n. The other information about Beatty sequences, prime gaps, etc., is the user's own attempt and context, which should be filtered out. Therefore, the structured problem should have assumptions on r and n as per the problem's statement. So the answer should be:\n\nAssumption:\nr is a real number,\nr is irrational,\nr > 1,\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that there are an infinite number of primes of the form ⌊r n⌋.",
