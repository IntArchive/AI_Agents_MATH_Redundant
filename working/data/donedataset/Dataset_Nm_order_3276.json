    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let me try to parse this problem. So the user wants me to act as a math professor, bilingual, and structure a problem from Math Stack Exchange into their specified format. Let me first read the example they gave to understand exactly what they need.\n\nThe example took the original problem about proving a number is divisible by 91 and broke down the assumptions into line items, each addressing one property. The original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and also that n is divisible by 7. Then the problem statement was simplified.\n\nNow, looking at the new problem from Math Stack Exchange. The title is about proving a function is convex given an inequality involving a determinant. The question states that for all x, y, z in an open interval I, where x < y < z < x + π, the determinant of the matrix with cosines, sines, and f(x), f(y), f(z) is non-negative. They want to show that f is convex on I.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. Let's list all conditions:\n\n1. The interval I is open.\n2. For all x, y, z in I, the determinant of the given 3x3 matrix is non-negative.\n3. The points x, y, z satisfy x < y < z < x + π.\n\nEach assumption should be on a separate line, addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let me check:\n\n- The first assumption is about the interval I being open. That's a single condition on I.\n- The second is the determinant being non-negative for all x, y, z in I (with the ordering). But wait, the determinant condition applies to all such triples x, y, z. So that's another condition on f and the interval.\n- The third is the ordering of x, y, z such that x < y < z < x + π. This is a condition on how x, y, z are chosen in I.\n\nWait, perhaps the user wants each assumption line to cover a single condition. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nI is an open interval,\nFor all x, y, z in I with x < y < z < x + π, the determinant of the matrix [cos x, sin x, f(x); cos y, sin y, f(y); cos z, sin z, f(z)] is greater than or equal to 0.\n\nBut in the example, each assumption is a single line. However, the determinant condition is a single condition, even though it involves multiple variables. So perhaps that's one line. Then the ordering of x, y, z is another line. Wait, but in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, it's split into \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So maybe here, we need to split into:\n\n- I is an open interval.\n- For all x, y, z in I, if x < y < z < x + π, then the determinant of the given matrix is non-negative.\n\nBut the determinant condition is a single assumption. However, the example split \"for every integer n\" into \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, in the example, the original problem was \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the user added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an extra assumption? Wait no, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7. Wait, maybe the example was wrong? Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions are n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect because the original problem didn't require n to be divisible by 7. It's possible that the example might have a mistake. But maybe the user intended to show how assumptions are split. Maybe in that example, perhaps the user made a mistake, but regardless, we need to follow the instruction.\n\nSo for the current problem, the user wants each assumption to be a single line, each addressing only one property or condition applied to one object. So for the current problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n1. I is an open interval.\n2. For all x, y, z in I, if x < y < z < x + π, then the determinant of the matrix [cos x, sin x, f(x); cos y, sin y, f(y); cos z, sin z, f(z)] is non-negative.\n\nBut maybe the x < y < z < x + π is a separate condition. Wait, but in the problem statement, that's part of the \"for all\" clause. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n\nI is an open interval,\nFor all x, y, z in I, when x < y < z < x + π, the determinant is ≥0.\n\nBut in the example, the user split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So maybe the user wants to list all explicit and implicit assumptions. But in the current problem, the determinant condition is given for all x, y, z in I with x < y < z < x + π. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n\nI is an open interval,\nx, y, z are elements of I such that x < y < z < x + π,\nThe determinant of the given 3x3 matrix is non-negative for all such x, y, z.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address only one property applied to one object. So splitting:\n\n- I is an open interval. (Property of I)\n- For all x, y, z in I, x < y < z < x + π implies determinant ≥0. (This is a condition on the determinant in relation to the ordering of x, y, z.)\n\nBut perhaps the user would split the ordering condition into a separate assumption? For example:\n\n- For all x, y, z in I, x < y < z < x + π.\n\nBut that's not an assumption on an object, but rather a condition under which the determinant is considered. Wait, but the problem states \"for all x,y,z of an open interval I for which x<y<z<x+π\". So the determinant condition holds for all triples satisfying that inequality. So the assumptions are:\n\n1. I is an open interval.\n2. For all x, y, z in I with x < y < z < x + π, the determinant is ≥0.\n\nSo each of these is a separate assumption. The first is about I, the second is about the determinant in relation to x, y, z.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nI is an open interval,\nFor all x, y, z in I with x < y < z < x + π, the determinant $$\\begin{vmatrix} \\cos{x} & \\sin{x} & f(x) \\\\ \\cos{y} & \\sin{y} & f(y) \\\\ \\cos{z} & \\sin{z} & f(z) \\end{vmatrix} \\ge 0$$.\n\nProblem: Show that $f(x)$ is convex on $I$.\n\nWait, but in the example, the user split the original problem's \"for every integer n\" into \"n is an integer\" and added another assumption \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original. Wait, maybe there was a mistake in the example. Because in the original problem, the user wrote:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer $n$, the number [...] is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that seems incorrect because the original problem didn't require n to be divisible by 7. So perhaps the example is wrong, but maybe the user intended that. Regardless, we need to follow the user's instructions, which say that each assumption should list one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo for the current problem, the key points are:\n\n- I is open.\n- For all triples x < y < z < x + π in I, the determinant is non-negative.\n\nThus, two assumptions. Then the problem is to show f is convex on I.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nI is an open interval,\nFor all x, y, z in I with x < y < z < x + π, the determinant of the matrix [cos x, sin x, f(x); ...] is ≥0.\n\nProblem: Show that f is convex on I.\n\nBut to make each assumption one line, so:\n\nAssumption:\nI is an open interval,\nFor all x, y, z in I, if x < y < z < x + π then the determinant $$\\begin{vmatrix} \\cos{x} & \\sin{x} & f(x) \\\\ \\cos{y} & \\sin{y} & f(y) \\\\ \\cos{z} & \\sin{z} & f(z) \\end{vmatrix} \\ge 0$$.\n\nProblem: Show that $f(x)$ is convex on $I$.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps split the determinant condition into a separate line, but I think it's one condition. So the final answer should have two assumptions and the problem.",
