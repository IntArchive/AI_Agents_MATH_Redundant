    "AcceptedAnswer": "First, a result: for any $x,y$ non-negative reals, $\\alpha + \\beta = 1 $, then $$ x^{\\alpha}y^{\\beta} \\leq \\alpha x + \\beta y $$ To show this, put $f(t) = (1 - \\beta) + \\beta t - t^{\\beta} $. Show this function decreases on $[0,1]$ and then replace $t$ with $\\frac{y}{x}$. Now, as for your problem Notice by application of previous result we get your problem $$ a^a b^b \\leq a^2 + b^2 $$ $$ a^b b^a \\leq 2ab $$ $$ \\therefore, \\qquad a^a b^b + a^b b^a \\leq a^2 + b^2 + 2ab = (a +b )^2 = 1^2 = 1 $$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the user wants me to structure the given math problem into the specified format. The original question is about proving that a^a b^b + a^b b^a ≤ 1 when a + b = 1, with a and b being positive real numbers.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that a and b are positive real numbers, and their sum is 1. Each assumption should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So, the first assumption is that a and b are positive real numbers. Wait, but the example given in the prompt lists each assumption per line, even if they are related. For instance, in the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are separate lines. But here, the problem mentions two conditions: a and b are positive, and a + b = 1. So each of these should be separate assumptions.\n\nWait, but the original problem states: \"a and b are positive real numbers\" and \"a + b = 1\". So those are two separate conditions. Therefore, the assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\na and b are positive real numbers,\na + b = 1.\n\nThen the problem is to prove the inequality.\n\nWait, but in the example, the user had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. However, in the original problem here, the user wrote \"Prove that for every integer n...\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption included n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but actually, the original example problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem's assumption includes n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that might be a mistake. Wait, the original problem in the example states \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption is \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps the example might have had a typo, but the user is providing that as an example. So perhaps the user wants to list all conditions given in the problem as assumptions, even if some are redundant. But in the case of the current problem, the problem states \"Given a + b = 1, Prove that...; a and b are positive real numbers.\" So the two assumptions are a and b are positive reals, and a + b =1. Therefore, in the formatted problem, each of these should be separate lines under Assumption.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\na and b are positive real numbers,\na + b = 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that a^a b^b + a^b b^a ≤ 1.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem had n is an integer and n divisible by 7. Wait, that's inconsistent. Wait, maybe the example was wrong. Wait, the original problem in the example says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem's assumptions are n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that's conflicting. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. So maybe the example is incorrect, but the user provided it. Therefore, perhaps in the current problem, I need to list all the given conditions as separate assumptions, even if they are part of the problem statement.\n\nIn the current problem, the user wrote: \"Given a + b = 1, Prove that a^a b^b + a^b b^a ≤ 1; a and b are positive real numbers.\" So the given conditions are that a and b are positive reals, and a + b =1. So those are two separate assumptions, each on their own line. Therefore, the formatted problem should have those two assumptions. The problem is to prove the inequality. That's all. So I think the correct structure is as such.",
