    "Content": "I am trying to solve an exercise from Vakil's lecture notes on algebraic geometry, namely, I want to show that $\\require{AMScd}$ \\begin{CD}\n    X_1\\times_Y X_2 @>>> X_1\\times_Z X_2\\\\\n    @V V V @VV V\\\\\n    Y @>>> Y \\times_Z Y\n\\end{CD} is a cartesian diagram. I think I've figured out where the maps come from: The lower map is the diagonal induced from the universal property of $Y \\times_Z Y$ , the upper map is coming from the universal property of $X_1\\times_Z X_2$ (this is one of the previous exercises in Vakil's notes), the map on the right also comes from the universal property of $Y \\times_Z Y$ since we have two maps from $X_1\\times_Z X_2$ to $Y$ whose composition with $Y\\rightarrow Z$ coincides, and finally the map on the left side is either composition $X_1\\times_Y X_2 \\rightarrow X_i \\rightarrow Y$ . At this point, I don't even see why this diagram should be commutative. But even discarding the issue of commutativity, given some $T$ instead of $X_1\\times_Y X_2$ making the above diagram commute, I have no clue how to obtain a canonical map $T \\rightarrow X_1\\times_Y X_2$ . I could solve all the other problems in this section of his notes, but this one eludes me. Any help or solution (preferably just using the universal properties that we're given) would be greatly appreciated.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "First, why is the diagram commutative: you've got the following commutative diagram: It is commutative precisely because this is how we defined the map $X_1 \\times_Y X_2 \\to X_1 \\times_Z X_2$. The bottom right square is used to define $Y \\to Y \\times_Z Y$. Now, you diagram is commutative iff the two maps $X_1 \\times_Y X_2 \\to Y \\times_Z Y$ are equal, iff each component maps are equal. The red path is used to define the (first component of the) map that factors through $X_1 \\times_Y X_2 \\to X_1 \\times_Z X_2 \\to Y \\times_Z Y$ The blue path is used to define the (first component of the) map that factors through $X_1 \\times_Y X_2 \\to Y \\to Y \\times_Z Y$. As you can see, they are equal. Therefore the magic diagram commutes. Now, the universal property. Suppose you're given $T \\to X_1 \\times_Z X_2$ and $T \\to Y$  such that the two maps $T \\to Y \\times_Z Y$ are equal. In other words, you're given maps $T \\to X_1$, $T \\to X_2$ and $T \\to Y$, such that the two maps $T \\to X_i \\to Z$ are equal, and the maps the blue path and the red path are equal (where $T$ is in the position of $X_1 \\times_Y X_2$). As you can see, this is precisely the same thing as giving two maps $T \\to X_i$ such that $T \\to X_i \\to Y$ are equal, because then the fact that the maps into $Z$ are equal is a consequence of the fact that the maps into $Y$ are equal. So there's a unique map $T \\to X_1 \\times_Y X_2$ making everything commute. Considering that Vakil introduces the Yoneda lemma after this exercise, I didn't dare give the proof using it. But by the Yoneda lemma, you can just consider the case of sets; in the equations that you'll write, you'll arrive at the same conclusion -- that giving a maps that make everything commute will give you a redundant condition that the images in $Z$ are the same, and that the fibered product of the whole thing is the fibered product over $Y$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants to show that a certain diagram is cartesian. The diagram is given as a commutative square with specific mappings.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the components of the diagram. The top left corner is X₁×Y X₂, mapping to X₁×Z X₂ on the top right. The bottom left is Y, mapping to Y×Z Y on the bottom right. The vertical maps connect these corners.\n\nThe assumptions here would relate to the properties of these fiber products and the maps between them. The problem is to prove that this square is cartesian, meaning it's a pullback square. \n\nLooking at the original question, the user mentions using universal properties. So, the key assumptions are the universal properties of the fiber products involved. Each corner of the diagram is a fiber product, so each has its own universal property. The goal is to use these universal properties to show that the square satisfies the conditions of a pullback.\n\nThe user also mentions commutativity of the diagram as a potential issue. So, another assumption is that the diagram commutes, which is necessary for it to be cartesian. However, since the problem is to prove it's cartesian, perhaps the commutativity isn't an assumption but part of what needs to be established. Wait, no—the problem statement likely assumes the maps are defined such that the diagram commutes, but the user is unsure. However, in the problem as presented, the user is trying to show the diagram is cartesian, which includes both commutativity and the universal property. But in the example given, assumptions are about the objects and their properties. So perhaps the key assumptions here are about the existence of the fiber products and the maps between them defined via their universal properties.\n\nSo, breaking down the assumptions:\n\n1. X₁×Y X₂ is the fiber product over Y.\n2. X₁×Z X₂ is the fiber product over Z.\n3. Y×Z Y is the fiber product over Z.\n4. The lower horizontal map Y → Y×Z Y is the diagonal morphism (from the universal property).\n5. The upper horizontal map X₁×Y X₂ → X₁×Z X₂ comes from the universal property of X₁×Z X₂.\n6. The right vertical map X₁×Z X₂ → Y×Z Y is induced by the two maps from X₁×Z X₂ to Y.\n7. The left vertical map is either of the projections from X₁×Y X₂ to Y.\n\nWait, but the problem is to show the square is cartesian. So perhaps the main assumption is that all the fiber products exist and the maps are as constructed via their universal properties. The problem then is to prove that the square formed by these maps is a pullback.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should list the definitions of each object and map involved. Each assumption addresses one object or one map's property. So:\n\nAssumption: X₁ and X₂ are schemes over Y.\nAssumption: Y is a scheme over Z.\nAssumption: The fiber product X₁ ×_Y X₂ exists.\nAssumption: The fiber product X₁ ×_Z X₂ exists.\nAssumption: The fiber product Y ×_Z Y exists.\nAssumption: The lower horizontal map Y → Y ×_Z Y is the diagonal morphism.\nAssumption: The upper horizontal map X₁ ×_Y X₂ → X₁ ×_Z X₂ is induced by the universal property of X₁ ×_Z X₂.\nAssumption: The right vertical map X₁ ×_Z X₂ → Y ×_Z Y is induced by the two projection maps to Y.\nAssumption: The left vertical map X₁ ×_Y X₂ → Y is the composition of either projection from X₁ ×_Y X₂ to X₁ or X₂ followed by the structure morphism to Y.\n\nBut wait, the problem is in the context of algebraic geometry, so all objects are schemes with morphisms. The key is that the square is cartesian, so we need to use the universal properties of the fiber products. The problem is to show that X₁ ×_Y X₂ is the pullback of the diagram X₁ ×_Z X₂ → Y ×_Z Y and Y → Y ×_Z Y.\n\nTherefore, the problem is to prove that the given square is cartesian (i.e., a pullback square) using the universal properties of the involved fiber products.\n\nSo, translating this into the required format:\n\nAssumption: X₁ and X₂ are schemes over Y.\nAssumption: Y is a scheme over Z.\nAssumption: The diagram uses the canonical morphisms from the universal properties of the fiber products X₁ ×_Y X₂, X₁ ×_Z X₂, and Y ×_Z Y.\nAssumption: The lower horizontal morphism Y → Y ×_Z Y is the diagonal morphism.\nAssumption: The right vertical morphism X₁ ×_Z X₂ → Y ×_Z Y is induced by the morphisms X₁ ×_Z X₂ → Y.\nProblem: Prove that the diagram\n\\begin{CD}\n    X_1\\times_Y X_2 @>>> X_1\\times_Z X_2\\\\\n    @V V V @VV V\\\\\n    Y @>>> Y \\times_Z Y\n\\end{CD}\nis cartesian.\n\nBut maybe each assumption should be more atomic. For example:\n\nAssumption: X₁ is a scheme over Y.\nAssumption: X₂ is a scheme over Y.\nAssumption: Y is a scheme over Z.\nAssumption: The fiber product X₁ ×_Y X₂ exists.\nAssumption: The fiber product X₁ ×_Z X₂ exists.\nAssumption: The fiber product Y ×_Z Y exists.\nAssumption: The morphism Y → Y ×_Z Y is the diagonal morphism.\nAssumption: The morphism X₁ ×_Y X₂ → X₁ ×_Z X₂ is induced by the universal property of X₁ ×_Z X₂.\nAssumption: The morphism X₁ ×_Z X₂ → Y ×_Z Y is induced by the two projections to Y.\nAssumption: The left vertical morphism X₁ ×_Y X₂ → Y is the canonical projection.\n\nBut perhaps some of these are redundant. For instance, the existence of the fiber products is standard in algebraic geometry (assuming the necessary conditions), but since the problem is about showing the diagram is cartesian, the key assumptions are about the morphisms involved being the canonical ones from the universal properties. The problem is then to show that with these canonical maps, the square is a pullback.\n\nSo maybe the assumptions are more about the structure of the diagram:\n\nAssumption: The lower horizontal arrow is the diagonal morphism Y → Y ×_Z Y.\nAssumption: The upper horizontal arrow is induced by the universal property of X₁ ×_Z X₂.\nAssumption: The right vertical arrow is induced by the two morphisms X₁ ×_Z X₂ → Y.\nAssumption: The left vertical arrow is the canonical projection X₁ ×_Y X₂ → Y.\nProblem: Prove that the square is cartesian.\n\nBut each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. Let me try again:\n\nAssumption: X₁ and X₂ are schemes over Y.\nAssumption: Y is a scheme over Z.\nAssumption: The morphism Y → Y ×_Z Y is the diagonal morphism.\nAssumption: The morphism X₁ ×_Y X₂ → X₁ ×_Z X₂ is induced by the universal property of the fiber product X₁ ×_Z X₂.\nAssumption: The morphism X₁ ×_Z X₂ → Y ×_Z Y is induced by the compositions X₁ ×_Z X₂ → X₁ → Y and X₁ ×_Z X₂ → X₂ → Y.\nAssumption: The left vertical morphism X₁ ×_Y X₂ → Y is the canonical projection.\n\nProblem: Prove that the diagram is cartesian.\n\nBut maybe even more granular. Each line is one assumption. For example:\n\nAssumption: X₁ is a scheme over Y.\nAssumption: X₂ is a scheme over Y.\nAssumption: Y is a scheme over Z.\nAssumption: The fiber product X₁ ×_Y X₂ is considered with its canonical projections to X₁ and X₂.\nAssumption: The fiber product X₁ ×_Z X₂ is considered with its canonical projections to X₁ and X₂.\nAssumption: The fiber product Y ×_Z Y is considered with its canonical projections to Y and Y.\nAssumption: The lower horizontal morphism Y → Y ×_Z Y is the diagonal morphism.\nAssumption: The upper horizontal morphism X₁ ×_Y X₂ → X₁ ×_Z X₂ is the canonical morphism induced by X₁ ×_Y X₂ → X₁ and X₁ ×_Y X₂ → X₂.\nAssumption: The right vertical morphism X₁ ×_Z X₂ → Y ×_Z Y is induced by the morphisms X₁ ×_Z X₂ → X₁ → Y and X₁ ×_Z X₂ → X₂ → Y.\nAssumption: The left vertical morphism X₁ ×_Y X₂ → Y is the canonical projection.\n\nBut some of these might be redundant. The key points are the existence of the fiber products and the definitions of the morphisms via their universal properties. The problem is then to show that with these definitions, the square is cartesian.\n\nI think the main assumptions here are the structures of the schemes and the morphisms between them, defined via universal properties. The problem is to verify the cartesian property.",
