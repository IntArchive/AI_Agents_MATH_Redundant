    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user provided a Math Stack Exchange question about a continued fraction for π/2. They want me to structure it into the specified format: Assumptions and Problem.\n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The title mentions an uncommon continued fraction of π/2. The question describes the continued fraction as:\n\nπ/2 = 1 + 1/(1 + (1·2)/(1 + (2·3)/(1 + (3·4)/(1 + ...)))\n\nThe user is stuck and mentions a clue about deriving Lord Brouncker’s fraction from Wallis' Formula. They want to know how to derive such continued fractions from convergent products.\n\nLooking at the example given, the Assumptions section lists each condition applied to one object. In the example, assumptions were that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Then the problem is stated.\n\nIn this case, the original problem doesn't explicitly state assumptions but mentions deriving the continued fraction in the same manner as Lord Brouncker’s, which uses Wallis' Formula. However, the user's problem is about π/2, not 4/π. The clue suggests that the first fraction (π/2) can be proved similarly to how Lord Brouncker’s was derived from Wallis' Formula.\n\nSo, assumptions would need to be extracted. The problem involves an infinite continued fraction, and the method relates to Wallis' Formula. However, the user hasn't specified if there are any preconditions. Since the user is stuck on deriving the continued fraction using Wallis' Formula, the assumption here is that the continued fraction is related to Wallis' Formula in a similar way as Lord Brouncker’s.\n\nBut the problem itself is to prove that the given continued fraction equals π/2, possibly using a method analogous to how Lord Brouncker’s was derived from Wallis' Formula. The user is asking for a systematic method to derive continued fractions from convergent products.\n\nTherefore, structuring the problem, the assumptions would be based on the given information. The problem mentions deriving from Wallis' Formula, so perhaps the assumption is that the continued fraction can be derived using a method similar to that used for Lord Brouncker’s fraction from Wallis' Formula.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumptions were specific to the problem (n is integer, divisible by 7). Here, the problem is to prove the continued fraction equals π/2. The original question doesn't state explicit assumptions, but the clue mentions that it can be done similarly to the Lord Brouncker’s derivation from Wallis. So maybe the assumption here is that the method used is analogous to deriving Lord Brouncker’s continued fraction from Wallis' product.\n\nBut perhaps the actual assumption needed is the existence of the continued fraction relation, or that Wallis' Formula is a starting point. However, the user's problem is to prove the given continued fraction equals π/2, and they are seeking direction. So maybe the problem is presented as is, with the assumption that the method parallels the derivation of Lord Brouncker's fraction from Wallis' Formula. But the example's assumptions were about the variables in the problem. Here, the problem is to show the equality, given that a similar derivation exists for Lord Brouncker's. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no explicit assumptions here beyond the continued fraction's form and the relation to Wallis' Formula. The problem is to prove that the continued fraction equals π/2, and the user is assuming that this can be done using a method similar to the Lord Brouncker’s derivation. Therefore, the assumption here could be that the continued fraction can be derived from Wallis' Formula using a method analogous to Lord Brouncker’s. But since the user is asking for help, perhaps the problem is just to prove the equality, given the hint about the method.\n\nIn the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". But the formatted problem in the example changed it, perhaps mistakenly. Wait, no. The original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But the example formatted problem's assumption is \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems contradictory. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That would make the problem statement different. So maybe the example is incorrect, but the user provided that as their example. Therefore, perhaps in this case, even if the original problem doesn't state assumptions, the assistant needs to extract implicit assumptions.\n\nBut in the given problem about continued fractions, the user is saying they are stuck and mentions the clue about deriving Lord Brouncker’s from Wallis. So perhaps the assumption here is that the user is working with Wallis' Formula as a starting point. But the problem is to prove the given continued fraction equals π/2. The example might not have a direct assumption, but in the original problem, the user is trying to use Wallis' Formula. Therefore, maybe the assumption is that the derivation method uses Wallis' Formula.\n\nBut how to structure this? The example seems to have taken a problem that originally had a universal quantifier (\"for every integer n\") and added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect, but perhaps the example was a mistake. However, the user wants the assistant to follow that format. So perhaps in the current problem, even though the user's problem doesn't state assumptions, we need to infer possible implicit assumptions. However, in the original question, the user is trying to derive the continued fraction from Wallis' Formula, similar to how Lord Brouncker’s was derived. So perhaps the assumption is that the continued fraction can be derived using a method analogous to Lord Brouncker’s approach from Wallis' Formula. But how to phrase that as an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is presented without additional assumptions. The original problem is to prove the continued fraction equals π/2, and the user is asking for help. So the formatted problem would list the continued fraction as given, and the problem is to prove the equality. But according to the example, assumptions are listed even if the original problem didn't state them. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Which is incorrect, because if n is any integer, then the divisibility by 91 must hold for all n. Adding that n is divisible by 7 would make the problem only for multiples of 7, which changes the problem. So perhaps the example is incorrect. But since the user provided that example, they might expect similar processing. Maybe they want to extract any conditions mentioned in the problem. Wait, the original example problem was \"Prove that for every integer n...\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Perhaps the user made an error in their example. But regardless, the task is to follow the example's structure.\n\nLooking back at the original user's question here: The problem is to prove that the given continued fraction equals π/2. The user mentions that the clue is that Lord Brouncker’s fraction was derived from Wallis' Formula, and they tried using Wallis' Formula but couldn't get close. So the assumption here is probably that the derivation method is analogous to how Lord Brouncker’s was derived from Wallis' Formula. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe continued fraction can be derived using a method analogous to the derivation of Lord Brouncker’s continued fraction from Wallis' Formula.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption addresses only one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe derivation method for continued fractions is analogous to that used for Lord Brouncker’s continued fraction,\nWallis' Formula is used as the starting point for the derivation.\n\nBut maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, since the problem is to prove the equality, maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond the given continued fraction structure. However, the example added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. So perhaps in this case, since the problem is to prove the continued fraction equals π/2, the only assumption is the existence of the continued fraction expression, but that's not really an assumption. Alternatively, maybe the problem has no assumptions, but the example requires assumptions. This is confusing because the example seems to have introduced an incorrect assumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended that in the example, the problem originally had an assumption that n is an integer (which it does, \"for every integer n\"), and the formatted problem lists that as an assumption. But then the example's formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\", which was not in the original problem. That seems like a mistake. But if I follow that example, perhaps the task is to extract all conditions from the problem statement, even if they are part of the universal quantifier.\n\nIn the original example, the problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is that n is an integer, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. But in the formatted example, they list \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But the original problem didn't say n is divisible by 7. This suggests that the example might have an error. Therefore, the user might have made a mistake in their example. But regardless, the task is to follow the format as per the example.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's question is about proving a continued fraction equals π/2. The given clue is that Lord Brouncker’s fraction was derived from Wallis' Formula, and the user is trying to do the same. So the assumptions here could be:\n\n- The continued fraction for π/2 is derived using a method similar to Lord Brouncker’s derivation.\n- Wallis' Formula is used as the foundation for the derivation.\n\nBut each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe continued fraction is derived analogously to Lord Brouncker’s continued fraction derivation,\nWallis' Formula is the convergent product used in the derivation.\n\nBut maybe that's stretching it. Alternatively, if the problem is to derive the continued fraction from Wallis' Formula, then the assumption is that Wallis' Formula is the starting point. However, the problem as stated is to prove that the given continued fraction equals π/2. The user mentions that the derivation method should be similar to Lord Brouncker’s, which uses Wallis' Formula. So the assumptions here could be that:\n\n- The derivation starts from Wallis' Formula.\n- The method parallels the derivation of Lord Brouncker’s continued fraction.\n\nBut the example's assumptions were about the variables (n being integer and divisible by 7), not about methods. This is a bit different. Perhaps in this case, there are no explicit assumptions beyond what's given. But since the example extracted even the universal quantifier as an assumption, maybe here the assumption is that the continued fraction expression is valid, or that the terms follow the pattern 1, 1·2, 2·3, etc.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to prove the equality, the assumption might be that the continued fraction converges, but that's typically part of the problem.\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. Given the example provided, perhaps the correct approach is to list any conditions or properties mentioned in the problem. The problem states the continued fraction form, so maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe continued fraction is of the form 1 + 1/(1 + (1·2)/(1 + (2·3)/(1 + ...))),\nEach numerator in the continued fraction is k·(k+1) for k starting at 1.\n\nBut these are part of the problem statement, not assumptions. The example's assumptions included conditions on the variable (n being integer, divisible by 7). In this problem, there are no variables with conditions. It's about proving an identity involving a continued fraction.\n\nGiven that, perhaps there are no explicit assumptions, and the problem is as stated. But the example included assumptions even when the original problem didn't have any beyond the universal quantifier. Given the confusion in the example, maybe the user expects to list the problem's given conditions as assumptions. However, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", which was translated into an assumption that \"n is an integer\", and added another assumption \"n is divisible by 7\" which wasn't in the original. This suggests that perhaps the user made a mistake in their example. But since the task is to follow the format, perhaps in this case, the assumption is that the continued fraction is constructed as given, and the problem is to prove it equals π/2.\n\nAlternatively, given the user's mention of deriving from Wallis' Formula, maybe the assumption is that Wallis' Formula is used, similar to Lord Brouncker’s derivation. So:\n\nAssumption:\nWallis' Formula is used to derive the continued fraction,\nThe derivation method parallels that of Lord Brouncker’s continued fraction.\n\nBut again, this is about the method, not the problem's conditions. The example's assumptions were about the variable's properties. Since the current problem doesn't have variables with conditions, maybe there are no assumptions, but the format requires listing them. However, the example included assumptions even when the original problem's conditions were part of the problem statement. Therefore, perhaps in this case, the assumptions are the structure of the continued fraction itself.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent, perhaps the best approach is to list the problem as given, with no assumptions, but according to the example, even if there are no explicit assumptions, perhaps we need to extract them. However, since the user's problem is about the continued fraction's relation to Wallis' Formula, and the user is seeking to derive it similarly to Lord Brouncker’s, the assumption could be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe continued fraction can be derived from Wallis' Formula using a method similar to Lord Brouncker’s derivation.\n\nBut the example listed assumptions about the variable, not the method. So maybe in this case, there are no applicable assumptions, and the problem is just as stated. However, the example includes assumptions even when not present. To adhere to the example's format, perhaps list the problem's components as assumptions. But this is unclear. Given the confusion, I'll proceed to structure the problem with the given continued fraction and the problem to prove it equals π/2, with any implicit assumptions based on the user's mention of the clue.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe continued fraction is constructed with numerators k(k+1) and denominators 1,\nThe derivation method parallels that of Lord Brouncker’s continued fraction from Wallis' Formula.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\frac{\\pi}{2}=1+\\dfrac{1}{1+\\dfrac{1\\cdot2}{1+\\dfrac{2\\cdot3}{1+\\dfrac{3\\cdot 4}{1+\\cdots}}}}$$\n\nBut each assumption should address one property applied to one object. So breaking down the assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\nThe continued fraction has numerators of the form k(k+1) for integers k ≥ 1,\nEach denominator in the continued fraction is 1,\nThe derivation method uses Wallis' Formula,\nThe approach is analogous to the derivation of Lord Brouncker’s continued fraction.\n\nBut maybe that's too many. Alternatively, given the problem statement, perhaps the main assumptions are that the continued fraction is as given and that Wallis' Formula is the starting point. But I think the correct approach here, following the example (even if the example is flawed), is to list the components that define the problem. However, since the example added an extra assumption not present in the original problem, perhaps in this case, since the user mentions the clue about deriving from Wallis' Formula, the assumption is that the derivation uses Wallis' Formula. But the example's assumption was about the variable's properties, so here, maybe there are no variable assumptions, and the problem is as stated. Hence, the assumptions section might be left blank, but the format requires listing assumptions. Therefore, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe continued fraction expression is as given,\nWallis' Formula is applicable for derivation.\n\nBut each on separate lines. However, the example's assumptions were about the variable's properties. Since this problem is about an identity, not a variable condition, maybe there are no assumptions, but the format requires them. This is tricky. Given the example, perhaps the assistant is supposed to extract any conditions or properties mentioned in the problem. The problem here states the continued fraction and references Wallis' Formula and Lord Brouncker’s derivation. Therefore, the assumptions might be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe continued fraction is of the form provided,\nWallis' Formula is used in the derivation,\nThe derivation method is analogous to that of Lord Brouncker’s continued fraction.\n\nBut each as separate lines. However, the example had two assumptions for the variable. Since this problem doesn't involve variables with conditions, perhaps the assumptions are about the structure and method. However, the user's example included assumptions about the variable, but this problem is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is to list no assumptions and just state the problem. But the example insists on having assumptions. Given the confusion, I'll proceed to structure it with the problem's given continued fraction as the main focus and mention the method as an assumption.",
