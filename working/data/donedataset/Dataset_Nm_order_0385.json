    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original problem is about proving that none of the numbers in the set {11, 111, 1111, ...} is a perfect square of an integer. \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. Each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. The example given had two assumptions: one stating that n is an integer and another that n is divisible by 7. So, breaking down the current problem:\n\nThe set in question is {11, 111, 1111, ...}, which are numbers consisting of all 1's except the first two digits. Wait, actually, starting from 11, each subsequent number adds another 1. So 11, 111, 1111, etc. The problem states that none of these is a perfect square. \n\nThe main objects here are the numbers in the set and the integer x which would be the square root. The assumptions would likely involve the structure of the numbers in the set (each is composed of all 1's except starting with two 1s) and perhaps modulo conditions to show they can't be squares.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about n's properties. Here, the problem is about the set elements not being squares. The original question doesn't mention any prior conditions; it's a general statement. So maybe the only assumption is that each element in the set is of the form 11...1 (with k digits, starting from 2). Wait, but how to phrase that as an assumption? The example had assumptions applied to one object each. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption: Each element in the set {11, 111, 1111, ...} is a number composed of k consecutive digits of 1, where k ≥ 2.\n\nBut maybe more precise. Alternatively, since the problem is to show that none of these numbers is a square, perhaps the assumptions are about the possible square x and the structure of these numbers. Wait, but the problem statement itself is the main point. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem had A(n) defined, and the formatted problem listed assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. However, the original problem's user example had \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, it was split into two assumptions: n is integer, n divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem said \"for every integer n\", so perhaps the user made a mistake? Wait, the example given by the user shows that the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, the assumption was that n is divisible by 7. That seems like maybe the example had a different original problem. Wait, no. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. Then the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that's conflicting. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. But maybe the example was a typo. Anyway, perhaps in this current problem, the assumptions would be that each number in the set is of the form with all 1's starting from 11, and that x is an integer. Wait, but the problem is to prove that no such x exists. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption: Each number in the set {11, 111, 1111, ...} is an integer composed of k consecutive 1's where k ≥ 2.\n\nAssumption: x is an integer.\n\nBut perhaps more precise. Alternatively, since the problem is to show that for all numbers in the set, there's no integer x such that x² equals the number. So maybe the key properties are the structure of the numbers (they are all 1's except starting with two 1s) and that x is an integer. But how to split into separate assumptions. Maybe:\n\nAssumption: Each element in the set {11, 111, 1111, ...} is a number composed of k digits, all 1's, where k ≥ 2.\n\nAssumption: x is an integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that there is no x ∈ ℤ such that x² is an element of the set {11, 111, 1111, ...}.\n\nBut the example given in the user's prompt had assumptions about the variable in the problem. For the original example, the problem was about A(n) being divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem had assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like a mistake. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so why add an assumption that n is divisible by 7? Unless the user example was incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the problem in the example was miswritten, and the original problem actually required n to be divisible by 7, but the user's example formatting added that as an assumption. Hmm. This is a bit confusing. Maybe in the current problem, there are implicit assumptions. For example, numbers like 11, 111, etc., are all congruent to 3 mod 4, and squares can't be 3 mod 4. But that's part of the proof, not the assumption. The problem statement itself is the main thing. So perhaps the assumptions are just that the numbers are in the given set and x is an integer. So:\n\nAssumption: Each element in the set {11, 111, 1111, ...} is an integer composed of k consecutive digits of 1, where k ≥ 2.\n\nAssumption: x is an integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that there is no x ∈ ℤ such that x² is in the set {11, 111, 1111, ...}.\n\nBut maybe even more precise. The numbers in the set are 11, 111, 1111, etc., which can be written as (10^{k} - 1)/9 for k ≥ 2. But perhaps that's part of the problem structure. Alternatively, since the problem is to show that none of these numbers is a square, perhaps the key assumption is about the form of the numbers. So:\n\nAssumption: For each integer k ≥ 2, the number composed of k consecutive 1's is an element of the set {11, 111, 1111, ...}.\n\nAssumption: x is an integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that no element in {11, 111, 1111, ...} is a perfect square of an integer x.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first assumption is redundant because the set is already defined. Maybe the problem is as stated, and the assumptions are just the properties needed. Wait, the example had \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, even though the problem said \"for every integer n\". So perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption: The set {11, 111, 1111, ...} consists of numbers with k digits, all 1's, for k ≥ 2.\n\nAssumption: x is an integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that there is no x ∈ ℤ such that x² is an element of the set {11, 111, 1111, ...}.\n\nI think that's the correct structure. Each assumption addresses one property: the structure of the numbers in the set, and the other that x is an integer. The problem then is to show no such x exists.",
