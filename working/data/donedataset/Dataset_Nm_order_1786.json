    "AcceptedAnswer": "Recall that $u\\times v$ is the only vector $w\\in\\mathbb{R}^3$ that satisfies \n$$\\forall\\, x\\in\\mathbb{R}^3,\\quad \\det(u,v,x)=\\langle w,x\\rangle$$\nSo, we have\n$$\\eqalign{\\det(M)\\langle a\\times b,x\\rangle&=\n\\det(M)\\det(a,b,x)\\cr&=\\det(Ma,Mb,Mx)\\cr\n&=\\langle Ma\\times Mb,Mx\\rangle\\cr\n&=\\langle M^T(Ma\\times Mb),x\\rangle\\cr\n}\n$$\nThus\n$$\\forall\\, x\\in\\mathbb{R}^3,\\quad \\langle\\det(M)( a\\times b),x\\rangle=\\langle M^T(Ma\\times Mb),x\\rangle$$\nIt follows that $\\det(M)( a\\times b)=M^T(Ma\\times Mb)$ or equivalently, for an invertible matrix $M$, \n$$\\det(M)(M^T)^{-1}( a\\times b)= Ma\\times Mb $$ Remark. The most general formula is \n$${\\rm Co}(M)( a\\times b)= Ma\\times Mb$$\nwhere ${\\rm Co}(M)$ is the matrix of cofactors of $M$. Here we do not need $M$ to be invertible. This follows from the proved formula by continuity.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into their specified format. The example they provided shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object. Then, the problem statement follows.\n\nLooking at the Math Stack Exchange question: It's about proving an identity involving the cross product and a matrix transformation. The identity given is (M a) × (M b) = det(M) (M^T)^{-1} (a × b). The user mentions that a and b are 3-vectors, and M is an invertible real 3x3 matrix.\n\nSo, first, I need to extract the assumptions. The original problem states that a and b are 3-vectors. So that's one assumption. Then, M is an invertible real 3x3 matrix. That's another assumption. Are there any other implicit assumptions? The cross product is defined in 3D, so maybe the vectors being 3-dimensional is important, but the problem already specifies they are 3-vectors. The invertibility of M is necessary because (M^T)^{-1} is used, so that's covered. Also, M is real. So each of these should be separate assumptions.\n\nSo breaking it down:\n\nAssumption 1: a is a 3-dimensional vector.\n\nAssumption 2: b is a 3-dimensional vector.\n\nAssumption 3: M is a real 3x3 matrix.\n\nAssumption 4: M is invertible.\n\nEach of these is a separate line in the assumptions. Then the problem is to prove the given identity.\n\nWait, but in the example provided, the original problem had \"for every integer n\" but the formatted problem included \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". However, in the given problem here, the original question doesn't have any additional conditions beyond what's stated. So all the assumptions are already in the problem statement: a, b are 3-vectors; M is invertible real 3x3 matrix. No hidden conditions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list each of these as separate assumptions. Let me check again:\n\n- a and b are 3-vectors: separate into two assumptions? Or one line saying both? The example had separate lines for each property applied to one object. For example, in the example, the first assumption was \"n is an integer\", then \"n is divisible by 7\". So here, since a and b are two separate objects, each with the property of being a 3-vector, perhaps each should be a separate assumption.\n\nSimilarly, M has multiple properties: being a real 3x3 matrix, and being invertible. Each of these should be separate lines.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\n\na is a 3-dimensional vector,\n\nb is a 3-dimensional vector,\n\nM is a real 3×3 matrix,\n\nM is invertible.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$(M a)\\times (M b)=\\det(M) (M^{\\rm T})^{-1}(a\\times b).$$\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each assumption is a single property for one object. The problem statement is then the identity to prove.",
