    "AcceptedAnswer": "There appears to be little hope of a formal proof, but this is how a standard heuristic argument would treat this problem, so we can determine whether the conjecture is plausible in the vein of Bateman-Horn as mentioned by reuns. Excluding an asymptotically small number of cases, most of the values $f(p_n,p_{n+1},p_{n+2})$ will be of size roughly $\\Theta(m^2 \\log^2 m)$, so if they were randomly distributed, we would expect about one in $\\log(m^2\\log^2 m) \\sim 2 \\log m$ of them to be prime, which would be $\\sim m/(2 \\log m)$. But we're seeing significantly more than that.  That's because those numbers are not randomly distributed: for starters, they're all odd, and that accounts for the missing factor of $2$.  A random number has a $\\frac12$ chance of not being divisible by $2$, but these numbers have double the chance. However, we're not done yet.  They also are unevenly distributed modulo $3$: each of $p_n,p_{n+1},p_{n+2}$ can be viewed as a uniform random sample from the non-zero residues mod $3$.  Of these $8$ possible inputs to $xy+yz+zx$, $2$ of them provide $0$.  So there is a $\\frac34$ chance of these numbers being indivisible by $3$, versus a $\\frac23$ chance for a random number: which is a factor of $\\frac98$ better.  Not as strong as the previous factor of $2$, but not insignificant. It turns out we can exactly calculate this factor for any given prime modulus $p$: the number of solutions to $xy+yz+zx \\equiv 0 \\pmod p$ with $x,y,z$ all non-zero is easy to compute, since it's equivalent to $z(x+y) \\equiv -xy$.  A straightforward calculation gives $(p-1)(p-2)$ zero-producing combinations out of $(p-1)^3$, for a $\\frac{p-2}{(p-1)^2}$ chance of being divisible by $p$, which is an advantage of $\\frac{p(p^2-3p+3)}{(p-1)^3}$. For large $p$ this fraction is approximately $1 + \\frac{1}{p^2}$, so we can combine all of these multiplicative factors for all primes $p$ into a convergent product yielding a single constant: this is the so-called singular series . The standard heuristic underlying Bateman-Horn and similar conjectures would then predict that the number of prime values should be asymptotic to: $$\\frac{m}{2\\log m}\\prod_{p\\text{ prime}} \\frac{p(p^2-3p+3)}{(p-1)^3} \\approx 1.15048 \\frac{m}{\\log m}.$$ This actually agrees remarkably well with your data, which shows the ratios of $|S_m|$ to $m/\\log m$ are: $$1.1521, 1.1976, 1.1813, 1.1900, 1.1630, 1.1344, 1.1313.$$ However, I don't have a good explanation for why it matches so well, since I would have expected a $O(1/\\log m)$ relative error so for these small values of $m$ it should be agreeing to only one digit, not two.  There may be something that miraculously cancels out the first-order error and leaves a $O(1/\\log^2 m)$ relative error. Update : For the similar sequence $T_m$, we can do a similar analysis with the polynomial $3(2n+1)^2-4$.  The singular series constant (with the factor of $\\frac12$ due to the quadratic growth rate) works out\n$$\\frac12 \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\frac32 \\cdot \\prod_{p\\ge 5\\text{ prime}}\\big(1-\\frac1p\\big)^{-1}\\big(1-\\frac{(3/p)}{p}\\big) \\approx 2.07508,$$ where $(3/p)$ is the Legendre symbol (so $+1$ if $p \\equiv 1,11$ mod $12$ and $-1$ if $p \\equiv 5,7$ mod $12$). This is significantly higher than the constant for $S_m$: much of the reason for this is that $3(2n+1)^2-4$ is lucky enough to be never divisible by any of the first four primes $2,3,5,7$ so it tends to be prime more often than a random number of the same size.  The factor of about $2.07$ seems to agree very well with the first few rows of your table, so you may want to double-check the computation of $T_{100000}$ as it seems not to fit the curve.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the problem from Math Stack Exchange. The original question is about a conjecture regarding the distribution of certain primes. \n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions. The problem mentions a function f(x,y,z) = xy + xz + yz. Then S_m is defined as the set of natural numbers n less than m such that applying f to the nth, (n+1)th, and (n+2)th primes results in a prime number. The conjecture is that the size of S_m is approximately m divided by the natural logarithm of m. \n\nLooking at the example provided earlier, assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Here, the objects involved are the function f, the set S_m, and the variables involved. \n\nSo, the first assumption is the definition of the function f. Then, S_m is defined based on certain conditions: n is a natural number, n is less than m, and the value of f applied to three consecutive primes is a prime. The conjecture itself is about the asymptotic behavior of |S_m| being similar to m/ln m. \n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included specific conditions like n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem's assumptions include the definition of f and the construction of S_m. The conjecture is the actual problem to prove. So the assumptions would be:\n\n1. The function f(x, y, z) = xy + xz + yz.\n2. For a given m, S_m is the set of natural numbers n < m such that f(p_n, p_{n+1}, p_{n+2}) is a prime number.\n3. The conjecture states that |S_m| ~ m / ln m as m becomes large.\n\nBut each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So breaking it down:\n\n- The function f is defined as f(x, y, z) = xy + xz + yz.\n- S_m is the set of n in natural numbers where n < m.\n- For each n in S_m, f(p_n, p_{n+1}, p_{n+2}) is a prime number.\n- The conjecture is about the asymptotic equivalence of |S_m| to m / ln m.\n\nBut maybe the problem statement already includes the conjecture, so the problem is to prove that |S_m| ~ m / ln m under the given definitions. So the assumptions would list the setup: the function f, the definition of S_m, etc. Each as separate lines.\n\nAlso, the problem mentions computational testing but the user wants a proof. The example's problem part was the statement to prove. So here, the problem part is the conjecture statement.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n- The function f is defined as f(x, y, z) = xy + xz + yz.\n- For a natural number m, S_m is defined as {n ∈ ℕ | n < m and f(p_n, p_{n+1}, p_{n+2}) ∈ ℙ}.\n- The primes p_n, p_{n+1}, p_{n+2} are consecutive primes.\n- The asymptotic notation ~ is used such that |S_m| / (m / ln m) approaches 1 as m approaches infinity.\n\nProblem: Prove that |S_m| ∼ m / ln m.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem statement is just the conjecture as stated, and the assumptions are the definitions and conditions. The example had the problem as the statement to prove, with the assumptions being the conditions given. So in the original problem, the conjecture is that |S_m| ∼ m / ln m. The assumptions would be the definitions of f, S_m, and the conditions on n. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem had A(n) defined, and the assumption was n is an integer and divisible by 7, but in the formatted problem, the assumption lists n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, then the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. Here, the user's example shows that even if the original problem didn't state the divisibility by 7 as an assumption, it was included. Wait, actually, looking at the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption adds \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the example was edited for brevity? Let me check.\n\nWait, in the original example, the problem is to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, the assumption is n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that can't be right. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which means no restriction on n. But the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That suggests that maybe the user made a mistake, or perhaps in the example, the problem was misrepresented. Alternatively, perhaps the example was from a different problem. Wait, the example says: Original problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91. Formatted problem: Assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91. But this contradicts because the original problem says for every integer n, but the formatted problem adds that n must be divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. So maybe the example is wrong, but the user provided it as an example. So perhaps in their formatting, they extracted assumptions even if they are not explicitly stated. That is, maybe the original problem had a mistake, and the formatted problem corrected it by adding assumptions.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user's task is to read the Math SE question and structure it with assumptions and problem. The original problem is the conjecture, which includes the definitions. So the assumptions would include the definitions of f and S_m, and the problem is the conjecture itself. So each part of the definition is an assumption. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- Let f(x, y, z) = xy + xz + yz.\n- For a natural number m, define S_m as the set of natural numbers n < m such that f(p_n, p_{n+1}, p_{n+2}) is a prime number.\n- The primes p_n, p_{n+1}, p_{n+2} are the nth, (n+1)th, and (n+2)th prime numbers.\n\nProblem:\nProve that |S_m| ∼ m / ln m as m approaches infinity.\n\nBut each assumption should be one line, each addressing one property. So splitting the S_m definition into parts:\n\nAssumption:\n- The function f is defined as f(x, y, z) = xy + xz + yz.\n- S_m is a set of natural numbers n such that n < m.\n- For each n in S_m, the value f(p_n, p_{n+1}, p_{n+2}) is a prime number.\n- The primes p_n, p_{n+1}, p_{n+2} are consecutive primes.\n\nProblem:\nProve that |S_m| ∼ m / ln m.\n\nThis way, each assumption is a single condition. The first defines the function, the second defines S_m's membership condition (n < m), the third defines the primality condition for inclusion in S_m, and the fourth clarifies that the primes are consecutive. Then the problem is to prove the asymptotic equivalence.",
