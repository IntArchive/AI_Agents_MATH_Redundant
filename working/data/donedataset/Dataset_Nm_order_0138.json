    "Content": "I've been working on this problem listed in Herstein's Topics in Algebra (Chapter 2.3, problem 4): If $G$ is a group such that $(ab)^i = a^ib^i$ for three consecutive integers $i$ for all $a, b\\in G$, show that $G$ is abelian. I managed to prove it, but I'm not very happy with my result (I think there's a neater way to prove this). Anyway, I'm just looking to see if there's a different approach to this. My approach : Let $j=i+1, k=i+2$ for some $i\\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Then we have that $(ab)^i = a^ib^i$, $(ab)^j = a^jb^j$ and $(ab)^k = a^kb^k$. If $(ab)^k = a^kb^k$, then $a^jb^jab =a^jab^jb$. We cancel on the left and right and we have $b^ja = ab^j$, that is $b^iba = ab^j$. Multiply both sides by $a^i$ on the left and we get $a^ib^iba = a^jb^j$, so $(ab)^iba = (ab)^j$. But that is $(ab)^iba = (ab)^iab$. Cancelling on the left yields $ab=ba$, which holds for all $a,b \\in G$, and therefore, $G$ is abelian. Thanks!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "A very similar solution, but maybe slightly shorter: again let $i$, $i+1$ and $i+2$ be the three consecutive integers that work for $a$ and $b$.  From $a^{i+1} b^{i+1}  = (ab)^{i+1} = (ab)(ab)^i = aba^i b^i$ we get $a^i b = b a^i$.  The same proof with $i$ replaced by $i+1$ gives\n$a^{i+1} b = b a^{i+1}$. Now $a b = a b a^i a^{-i} = a a^i b a^{-i} = a^{i+1} b a^{-i} = b a^{i+1} a^{-i} = b a$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's break down the problem step by step. The user wants me to structure the given problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The original problem is about proving that a group G is abelian if the condition (ab)^i = a^i b^i holds for three consecutive integers i for all a, b in G. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The example provided lists each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Looking at the problem, the key points are:\n\n1. G is a group.\n2. For all a, b in G, the equation (ab)^i = a^i b^i holds for three consecutive integers i.\n\nThese are the two main assumptions. Each should be a separate line. The problem statement is to show that G is abelian, which means we need to prove that ab = ba for all a, b in G.\n\nI should check if there are any other implicit assumptions. The problem mentions three consecutive integers, but it doesn't specify any particular integers, so the assumption is that there exist three consecutive integers (could be any, like i, i+1, i+2) for which the equation holds. Also, the group isn't restricted to being finite or any specific type, so just stating G is a group suffices.\n\nNow, formatting according to the example. The assumptions are listed line by line, each as a separate point. The problem is to prove G is abelian.\n\nWait, the original problem in the example had an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the Herstein problem, there's no such extra condition. The user in the example might have included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem, but perhaps the original problem had a mistake or additional context. Wait, looking back, the example's original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That might be an error. Wait, no, maybe the user made a mistake in their example. Wait, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That's contradictory because if it's for every integer n, then the divisibility by 91 should hold regardless. So perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user provided it as their own example. So maybe in their example, they filtered out some unrelated information and restructured it. So perhaps in the original problem, there was an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the user restructured it by listing that as an assumption. But in the Herstein problem here, the problem is as stated: G is a group where (ab)^i = a^i b^i for three consecutive integers i for all a, b. So the assumptions are the group and the three consecutive integers condition. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a group,\nFor all a, b in G, there exist three consecutive integers i such that (ab)^i = a^i b^i.\n\nWait, but the original problem states \"for three consecutive integers i for all a, b in G\". So it's that the same three consecutive integers work for all a, b in G. So the correct assumptions are:\n\n- G is a group.\n- There exist three consecutive integers i such that for all a, b in G, (ab)^i = a^i b^i.\n- (Also, perhaps that this holds for three consecutive integers, but the problem says \"three consecutive integers i for all a, b\". So it's the same three integers for all a, b. So the assumption is that there exist three consecutive integers i, j, k (like i, i+1, i+2) such that for all a, b in G, (ab)^i = a^i b^i, (ab)^{i+1} = a^{i+1} b^{i+1}, and (ab)^{i+2} = a^{i+2} b^{i+2}.\n\nBut the problem statement in Herstein is: \"If G is a group such that (ab)^i = a^i b^i for three consecutive integers i for all a, b ∈ G, show that G is abelian.\"\n\nSo the key assumptions are:\n\n1. G is a group.\n2. There exist three consecutive integers i such that for all a, b ∈ G, the equation (ab)^i = a^i b^i holds for each of these three integers.\n\nTherefore, each of these should be separate assumptions. But in the example given by the user, the assumptions are listed line by line, each as a single property. So here, the first assumption is \"G is a group\", the second assumption is \"For three consecutive integers i, (ab)^i = a^i b^i holds for all a, b ∈ G.\"\n\nWait, but the problem states that the equations hold for three consecutive integers i. So maybe the second assumption is better phrased as \"There exist three consecutive integers i such that (ab)^i = a^i b^i for all a, b ∈ G.\" But to split into separate lines, perhaps:\n\n- G is a group.\n- There exists an integer i such that (ab)^i = a^i b^i for all a, b ∈ G.\n- (ab)^{i+1} = a^{i+1} b^{i+1} for all a, b ∈ G.\n- (ab)^{i+2} = a^{i+2} b^{i+2} for all a, b ∈ G.\n\nBut the problem states three consecutive integers, not necessarily i, i+1, i+2. However, three consecutive integers can be represented as i, i+1, i+2 for some integer i. So the assumptions are:\n\n- G is a group.\n- There exists an integer i such that for all a, b ∈ G, the equations (ab)^i = a^i b^i, (ab)^{i+1} = a^{i+1} b^{i+1}, and (ab)^{i+2} = a^{i+2} b^{i+2} hold.\n\nBut the user's example lists each assumption line by line. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a group,\nThere exists an integer i such that (ab)^i = a^i b^i for all a, b ∈ G,\n(ab)^{i+1} = a^{i+1} b^{i+1} for all a, b ∈ G,\n(ab)^{i+2} = a^{i+2} b^{i+2} for all a, b ∈ G.\n\nBut the problem statement says \"for three consecutive integers i\", so the three consecutive integers are i, i+1, i+2. However, the problem doesn't specify that the three consecutive integers are in the form i, i+1, i+2, but in practice, any three consecutive integers can be written as such. So it's acceptable to model them as i, i+1, i+2.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be structured as:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a group,\nFor all a, b ∈ G, there exist three consecutive integers i such that (ab)^i = a^i b^i.\n\nBut the original problem states \"for three consecutive integers i for all a, b ∈ G\", which means that the same three integers work for all a, b. So it's that there exists three consecutive integers (which can be denoted as i, i+1, i+2) such that for all a, b, the equations hold for those three i's.\n\nTherefore, the correct assumptions are:\n\n- G is a group.\n- There exist three consecutive integers such that for each of these integers i, the equation (ab)^i = a^i b^i holds for all a, b ∈ G.\n\nBut to split into line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a group,\nThere exists an integer k such that (ab)^k = a^k b^k for all a, b ∈ G,\n(ab)^{k+1} = a^{k+1} b^{k+1} for all a, b ∈ G,\n(ab)^{k+2} = a^{k+2} b^{k+2} for all a, b ∈ G.\n\nThis way, each of the three consecutive integers (k, k+1, k+2) is an assumption line. However, the problem states that these are three consecutive integers, so maybe we need to mention that k, k+1, k+2 are consecutive, but in the example given by the user, the assumption for the original problem was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" So each line is a separate condition. Here, the three equations for k, k+1, k+2 are separate conditions, each applied to all a, b in G.\n\nBut the problem says \"for three consecutive integers i\", so perhaps the key is that there are three consecutive integers where the equation holds for each i. So each of those i's is an assumption line. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a group,\nFor some integer i, (ab)^i = a^i b^i for all a, b ∈ G,\nFor the integer i+1, (ab)^{i+1} = a^{i+1} b^{i+1} for all a, b ∈ G,\nFor the integer i+2, (ab)^{i+2} = a^{i+2} b^{i+2} for all a, b ∈ G.\n\nBut in the example provided by the user, the assumptions are listed as separate lines, each as one property. So following that structure, this would be correct.\n\nNow, the problem is to show G is abelian. Therefore, the formatted problem should have these assumptions and the problem statement.",
