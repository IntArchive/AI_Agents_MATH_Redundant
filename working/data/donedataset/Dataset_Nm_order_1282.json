    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The problem states that if A and B are matrices such that A + B = AB, then we need to prove that AB = BA. The user also mentioned something about invertibility, so maybe that's a key part here.\n\nFirst, let's recall some matrix properties. If two matrices commute (AB = BA), it doesn't necessarily mean they're invertible. But the user thinks that AB = BA implies invertibility. Wait, maybe they meant that if AB = BA, then perhaps one of them is invertible? Or maybe under the given condition A + B = AB, we need to show both that AB = BA and that they are invertible?\n\nWait, the original problem is: If A + B = AB, then prove AB = BA. So the main goal is to show commutativity. The user tried to connect invertibility to this, but they're stuck. Let me focus on the given equation: A + B = AB.\n\nI need to manipulate this equation to get AB = BA. Maybe rearranging terms. Let's see. If A + B = AB, then maybe subtract AB from both sides: A + B - AB = 0. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, can we factor this expression?\n\nLet me think. Let's try to rearrange the equation A + B = AB. Let's move all terms to one side: AB - A - B = 0. Now, maybe add the identity matrix to both sides to factor it. Wait, that might not work directly. Let me see:\n\nAB - A - B + I = I. Then, factor as (A - I)(B - I) = I. Let's check that. Expanding (A - I)(B - I) gives AB - A - B + I, which matches the left side. So yes, (A - I)(B - I) = I. That means that (A - I) and (B - I) are inverses of each other. Therefore, (B - I)(A - I) = I as well, since the inverse is two-sided. Let's expand that: BA - B - A + I = I. So BA - B - A = 0, which implies BA = A + B. But from the original equation, A + B = AB. Therefore, BA = AB. Hence, AB = BA. \n\nSo the key step was realizing that (A - I) and (B - I) are inverses, hence their product in reverse order is also the identity. That leads directly to BA = AB. \n\nBut wait, does this require the matrices to be square? Because only square matrices can be invertible. The problem didn't specify, but in the context of matrices, AB and BA are both defined only if A and B are square matrices. Or maybe A is m x n and B is n x m, but then AB would be m x m and BA n x n. However, in the equation A + B = AB, the dimensions have to match. So A and B must be square matrices of the same size. So perhaps the assumption is that A and B are square matrices of the same dimension. The original problem didn't state that, but it's implied in the context of matrix addition and multiplication. So maybe that's an implicit assumption.\n\nSo the problem should have assumptions that A and B are square matrices of the same size. Then, given that A + B = AB, prove that AB = BA.\n\nThe user also mentioned invertibility. From the steps above, since (A - I)(B - I) = I, both (A - I) and (B - I) are invertible, hence A - I and B - I are invertible matrices. Therefore, A and B might not be invertible themselves, but their adjusted versions (minus identity) are. But the problem didn't ask about invertibility of A or B directly, just that the user was trying to connect AB = BA to invertibility. But in the solution, the key was the invertibility of (A - I) and (B - I), not A or B themselves.\n\nSo putting it all together, the problem requires that A and B are square matrices of the same size, and given that their sum equals their product, we can derive that they commute.",
