    "Content": "Let $f: X \\to Y$ be a covering (proper, surjective, finite regular map) of smooth projective varieties of degree $d$. How one can show that in this case $f_* \\mathcal{O}_X$ is a locally free sheaf of rank $d$?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The answer relies on the following  incredibly general and simple result: Given a finite morphism of schemes $f:X\\to Y$ with $Y$ locally noetherian, the sheaf $f_*\\mathcal O_X$ is locally trivial iff $f$ is flat. The proof  consists in quoting a result in commutative algebra: a module $M$ over a ring $R$ is flat of finite presentation iff it is finitely generated and projective [cf. Bourbaki, Commutative Algebra, Chapter II, §5.3, Corollary 2, page 111] Once more Mumford's brilliant aphorism applies: Flatness is a riddle that comes out of algebra , but which technically is the answer to many prayers. If $Y$ is smooth, any finite surjective morphism is flat and the above applies, so that $f_*\\mathcal O_X$ is locally free, just as you wished. Edit The last assertion is a particular case of a wonderful result, aptly named by some geometers miracle flatness . It goes like this: Let $f:X\\to Y$ be a surjective morphism between varieties over a field,  with $X$ Cohen-Macaulay (for example regular) and $Y$ regular. If all fibers of $f$ are of the same dimension, then $f$ is flat. A reference for this theorem is GÖRTZ-WEDHORN , Corollary 14.128, page 475.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example provided shows breaking down assumptions line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. Then stating the problem clearly.\n\nThe original question is about showing that the push forward of the structure sheaf along a covering map is locally free of rank d. The user provided a title and a question from Math Stack Exchange. Let me parse that.\n\nThe problem states: Let f: X → Y be a covering (proper, surjective, finite regular map) of smooth projective varieties of degree d. Need to show that f_* O_X is a locally free sheaf of rank d.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. Let's break down the given conditions:\n\n1. f is a covering map. But \"covering\" here is defined in parentheses as proper, surjective, finite regular map. So each of these properties (proper, surjective, finite, regular) are separate. Wait, but in algebraic geometry, a finite morphism is usually separated and of finite type, but here it's specified as a finite regular map. Maybe \"regular\" here means that it's a morphism of varieties, so perhaps that's redundant if X and Y are already smooth projective varieties. Hmm. But I should include all the properties listed.\n\nWait, the problem says \"covering (proper, surjective, finite regular map)\". So in this context, the author defines a covering as a proper, surjective, finite, regular map. So each of those properties (proper, surjective, finite, regular) are part of the definition of the covering here. So each should be listed as separate assumptions.\n\nThen, X and Y are smooth projective varieties. The map f has degree d.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- f: X → Y is a proper morphism.\n- f is surjective.\n- f is a finite morphism.\n- f is a regular map.\n- X is a smooth projective variety.\n- Y is a smooth projective variety.\n- f has degree d.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"covering (proper, surjective, finite regular map) of smooth projective varieties of degree d\". So the degree d is part of the covering's definition here. So \"of degree d\" applies to the map f. So each bullet point should be a separate assumption.\n\nSo each property (proper, surjective, finite, regular) is applied to f. Then X and Y being smooth projective varieties are separate. Then f has degree d. So:\n\nAssumption:\nf: X → Y is proper,\nf is surjective,\nf is finite,\nf is a regular map,\nX is a smooth projective variety,\nY is a smooth projective variety,\nf has degree d.\n\nEach of these is a single line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then the problem is to show that f_* O_X is a locally free sheaf of rank d.\n\nI should check if \"finite regular map\" is a standard term or if \"regular\" is redundant. But since the problem explicitly lists \"finite regular map\" in the parentheses, I should include both \"finite\" and \"regular\" as separate assumptions. Although in algebraic geometry, a finite morphism is automatically separated and of finite type, but maybe here \"regular\" is to emphasize that it's a morphism of varieties. Since X and Y are smooth projective varieties, their structure sheaves are O_X and O_Y, so the morphism is a regular map. So including \"regular\" as a separate assumption is correct per the problem's phrasing.\n\nAlso, note that the problem mentions \"smooth projective varieties\", so each of X and Y being smooth and projective. Should \"smooth\" and \"projective\" be separate assumptions? The example given in the original prompt had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate lines. So for each property, even if they are adjectives applied to the same object, they should be separate.\n\nTherefore, for X: \"X is a smooth projective variety\" should be split into \"X is smooth\", \"X is projective\", and similarly for Y. Wait, but in the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are separate. So perhaps here, \"X is a smooth projective variety\" is a single assumption. Wait, no. Wait, the problem states \"smooth projective varieties\". But in terms of assumptions, each should address only one property. So, maybe:\n\n- X is smooth,\n- X is projective,\n- Y is smooth,\n- Y is projective.\n\nBut the original problem says \"smooth projective varieties\", so maybe the user wants each adjective as a separate assumption. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", so the assumption was \"$n$ is an integer\". Then another assumption was \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". So in that case, each assumption is one property. Similarly, here, \"smooth projective varieties\" would be two properties per variety. So splitting into X is smooth, X is projective, Y is smooth, Y is projective.\n\nBut the problem statement as given says \"smooth projective varieties\". So if the original problem says \"smooth projective varieties\", then maybe in the assumptions, we need to split into separate lines for smooth and projective.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- f: X → Y is proper,\n- f is surjective,\n- f is finite,\n- f is a regular map,\n- X is smooth,\n- X is projective,\n- Y is smooth,\n- Y is projective,\n- f has degree d.\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"covering (proper, surjective, finite regular map) of smooth projective varieties of degree d\". So \"of smooth projective varieties\" would apply to X and Y. So perhaps:\n\n- X and Y are smooth projective varieties.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption addresses only one property or condition applied to one object. So \"X is a smooth projective variety\" is two properties: smooth and projective. Therefore, split into X is smooth, X is projective, Y is smooth, Y is projective.\n\nBut in the example, the user had two separate assumptions about n: being integer and divisible by 7. So for the same object, multiple properties. Similarly here, X has two properties: smooth and projective. So each should be a separate line.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should be listed as:\n\n- f: X → Y is a proper morphism,\n- f is surjective,\n- f is a finite morphism,\n- f is a regular map,\n- X is smooth,\n- X is projective,\n- Y is smooth,\n- Y is projective,\n- f has degree d.\n\nThen the problem is to show that f_* O_X is a locally free sheaf of rank d.\n\nWait, but in algebraic geometry, a finite morphism between Noetherian schemes is proper, so if f is finite, then it's automatically proper. But the problem explicitly lists \"proper\" as part of the covering's definition, so even if redundant, we need to include it as an assumption. Because the problem defines the covering as proper, surjective, finite regular map.\n\nSo we have to list all these properties as separate assumptions even if some imply others.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to list each property given in the problem statement as a separate assumption, regardless of redundancy.\n\nTherefore, the final structured problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf: X → Y is proper,\nf is surjective,\nf is finite,\nf is a regular map,\nX is smooth,\nX is projective,\nY is smooth,\nY is projective,\nf has degree d.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $f_* \\mathcal{O}_X$ is a locally free sheaf of rank $d$.",
