    "AcceptedAnswer": "When both integers are positive, this is a special case of the converse to Bézout's theorem (labeled (ii) on the linked page). If $a+b=p$, that theorem (with $x=y=1$) tells us that $\\gcd(a,b)$ must be a divisor of $p$. But if $p$ is prime, that means $\\gcd(a,b)$ is either $p$ or $1$. Moreover, if $a$ and $b$ are both positive, then $a+b=p$ implies that $a$ and $b$ are both smaller than $p$, so they cannot have $p$ as a divisor. So $\\gcd(a,b)=1$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem from Math Stack Exchange. The user is asking if it's trivial to state that any two positive integers are co-prime if their sum is a prime number. They also mention having a proof but are unsure if it's a straightforward fact.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question correctly. The title is the main statement: \"Any two positive integers are co-prime if their sum is a prime number.\" The question itself is whether this is a trivial statement. The user has a proof but is concerned about its obviousness.\n\nNow, following the required format, I need to list the assumptions one by one, each addressing a single property or condition applied to one object. Then, restate the problem concisely.\n\nStarting with the assumptions. The problem involves two positive integers. Their sum is a prime number. We need to state that these two numbers are co-prime. So, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. The two objects are positive integers. (Each is a positive integer.)\n2. Their sum is a prime number. (Applied to both together, but since they are a pair, maybe this counts as one condition. Wait, the example given in the format had each assumption line as a separate condition. Let me check the example again.)\n\nIn the example provided, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91. The assumptions listed were \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" But in the problem statement, the original problem didn't have the divisibility by 7; perhaps that was part of the problem's conditions. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems confusing. Wait, no, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they changed it to have the assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, so perhaps the user restructured the problem to have specific conditions. Maybe the example was modified to show how assumptions are separated.\n\nIn this current problem, the original statement is that any two positive integers with a prime sum are co-prime. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- The two numbers are positive integers.\n\n- Their sum is a prime number.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The problem then is to prove that they are co-prime.\n\nWait, but the original problem's title says \"Any two positive integers are co-prime if their sum is a prime number.\" So the problem is to determine if that statement is true. The user is asking if it's trivial, but the formatted problem should present the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nSo following the example, the Assumption section lists all the conditions. Here, the two numbers are positive integers, and their sum is prime. Then the problem is to prove they are co-prime.\n\nTherefore, formatted as per instructions:\n\nAssumption:\n- $a$ and $b$ are positive integers.\n- The sum $a + b$ is a prime number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $a$ and $b$ are co-prime.\n\nBut wait, the original problem's title says \"Any two positive integers are co-prime if their sum is a prime number.\" So the problem is to prove that if two positive integers have a prime sum, then they are coprime. So the problem statement should be as above.\n\nBut in the example, the problem was restructured to have the assumptions listed and the problem as the statement to prove. So yes, that's correct.\n\nAnother check: Each assumption is a single property applied to one object. Here, \"a and b are positive integers\" is two objects but one condition each. Wait, the example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", both about n. So here, maybe the first assumption is \"a is a positive integer\" and \"b is a positive integer\". But perhaps the user groups them as \"a and b are positive integers\" as one line. The example combined two properties for n into separate lines. Wait, in the example, the original problem was \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. So perhaps in the example, they split into two assumptions: n is integer, and n divisible by 7. But in the current problem, the two numbers are positive integers, so each is a positive integer. But since the problem is about two numbers, maybe the first assumption is \"a and b are positive integers\", and the second is \"a + b is a prime number\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe split into:\n\nAssumption:\n- $a$ is a positive integer.\n- $b$ is a positive integer.\n- $a + b$ is a prime number.\n\nBut according to the example, the first assumption was \"n is an integer\", which is a single property for one object. So perhaps here, splitting into two lines for a and b.\n\nBut maybe the user considers \"a and b are positive integers\" as one assumption. The example's first assumption was \"n is an integer\". If the original problem states \"any two positive integers\", then perhaps the first assumption is \"a and b are positive integers\" as one line, and the second is \"a + b is a prime number\".\n\nBut the example's original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". So they split into two separate conditions for n. So maybe in this case, the first assumption is \"a is a positive integer\", second \"b is a positive integer\", third \"a + b is a prime number\".\n\nBut since the problem is about pairs, it's possible that \"a and b are positive integers\" is considered one assumption. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem was for every integer n, so the formatted assumption was \"n is an integer\", then added \"n is divisible by 7\". So each assumption is a single condition. So in this case, the two positive integers would be two separate assumptions: a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer. Then their sum being prime is another assumption.\n\nBut the problem states \"any two positive integers\", so maybe combining them as \"a and b are positive integers\" as one assumption. However, the example splits the conditions on the same object into separate lines. So perhaps for two different objects, each gets their own line. But in the example, n is the only object. Here, we have two objects, a and b. Therefore, maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n- $a$ is a positive integer.\n- $b$ is a positive integer.\n- $a + b$ is a prime number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $a$ and $b$ are coprime.\n\nThis seems to follow the format. Each assumption is a single property of one object. The third assumption involves both a and b but is a single condition on their sum. The problem is then to prove coprimality.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be as above.",
