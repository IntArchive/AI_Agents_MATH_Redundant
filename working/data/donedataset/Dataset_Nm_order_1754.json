    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is asking to prove the identity involving an infinite sum of cubed binomial coefficients divided by 2^{6n}, which equals π divided by the fourth power of the Gamma function evaluated at 3/4. The original problem also references some attempts using integral transformations and relates it to other known sums, like Ramanujan's.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the core problem. The main equation is the sum from n=0 to infinity of (2n choose n)^3 / 2^{6n} equals π over Gamma(3/4)^4. The assumptions here are probably about the convergence of the series and the properties of the Gamma function. But looking at the example provided earlier, the assumptions are specific conditions on the variables involved. In the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is an infinite series, so maybe the assumption is that the series converges? However, the user might not state that explicitly. Alternatively, since binomial coefficients and Gamma functions are involved, perhaps the assumptions relate to the domain of the Gamma function or the validity of the integral representations used.\n\nWait, the problem statement doesn't mention any specific conditions on variables like n; it's an infinite sum. The Gamma function is defined for complex numbers except non-positive integers, but 3/4 is a positive real number, so Gamma(3/4) is defined. Maybe the key assumptions are about the convergence of the series and the validity of the integral representations used in the attempt. But the example given earlier listed specific conditions on n. However, in this problem, there's no variable like n being an integer—it's a sum over integers n, so n is an index variable here. The problem is to prove the equality, so the assumptions might not be explicit in the problem statement. But according to the user's format, we need to list each assumption as a single property applied to one object.\n\nWait, looking at the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n,\" but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, actually, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, they added that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that might be a mistake. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. Maybe the example was incorrect? Wait, perhaps in the example, the user made a mistake. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which would restrict n, conflicting with the original problem's \"for every integer n\". Hmm, maybe the example is wrong. But the user provided that as their example, so I should follow their structure.\n\nBut in the current problem, the sum is from n=0 to infinity, so n is a non-negative integer. So perhaps the assumption is that n is a non-negative integer. Also, the problem involves Gamma functions, which require their arguments to not be non-positive integers. Since 3/4 is safe, maybe no other assumptions are needed. Alternatively, the integral representations used in the attempt may require certain conditions. The user's attempt uses integral (1+x^2)^{-(n+1)} dx from 0 to infinity, which converges for n >=0. So maybe the key assumptions are that n is a non-negative integer. But in the problem statement, the sum is over n starting at 0, so n is a non-negative integer. Therefore, the assumption would be \"n is a non-negative integer\".\n\nBut in the example, the user split into two assumptions: \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So for this problem, the assumptions would be \"n is a non-negative integer\" and maybe something else. Wait, but the problem is about the sum, so each term in the sum is for n from 0 to infinity. The problem itself is to prove the equality. The problem doesn't state conditions under which the equality holds; it's presented as an identity. So perhaps there are no explicit assumptions beyond the sum being over n ≥ 0, which is standard for such series. But according to the user's format, we need to list assumptions. Maybe the Gamma function is defined at 3/4, but that's inherent. Alternatively, the problem might assume convergence of the series, but that's part of the problem. Alternatively, since the user's attempt uses integral representations, maybe the assumption is the validity of those integrals for n being a non-negative integer. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a non-negative integer,\nthe integral representation ${2n\\choose n}\\cdot{\\pi\\over 2^{2n+1}}=\\int_{0}^{\\infty}{\\mathrm dx\\over (1+x^2)^{n+1}}$ is valid,\nthe integral transformation using $x = \\tan u$ is applicable.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were properties of the variable in the problem. Here, the problem is to prove an identity, so maybe the key assumption is that the series converges. However, the user's example included assumptions that were not in the original problem. The original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That suggests that the assistant might have made a mistake in the example. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a typo, and the user intended to have n divisible by 7. But regardless, following the user's example, even if the original problem didn't state the assumption, the formatted problem added it. Wait, no—in the example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n)... is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, the assumption is \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory because the original says \"for every integer n\", which includes all integers, but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That changes the problem. Maybe the example was incorrect. However, since the user provided that example, perhaps they want me to list assumptions that are necessary for the problem to hold, even if not explicitly stated. For instance, in the example, maybe divisibility by 91 requires that n is divisible by 7, but the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which is incorrect. So the assistant corrected it by adding assumptions.\n\nIn the current problem, the identity is presented as given. To prove the sum equals π over Gamma^4(3/4). The key assumptions here might be related to the convergence of the series and the properties of the Gamma function. However, the Gamma function at 3/4 is just a constant, so maybe no assumptions are needed beyond the series being convergent. But since the problem is to prove the equality, perhaps the main assumption is that the series converges. Alternatively, the problem might be assuming that certain integral representations or transformations are valid, as in the attempt. But according to the user's example, assumptions are properties applied to one object. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe series $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}{{2n\\choose n}^3\\over 2^{6n}}$ converges,\nThe Gamma function $\\Gamma(3/4)$ is defined.\n\nBut the Gamma function is defined at 3/4, so that's not really an assumption. The convergence of the series is part of the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that n is a non-negative integer, which is inherent in the summation index. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a non-negative integer.\n\nBut the problem is about the sum, so each term is for n ≥ 0. Therefore, the assumption is that n is a non-negative integer. However, in the example, the assumption was on the variable in the problem statement. Here, n is the summation index, so it's implied. But following the user's format, perhaps we need to list that. Alternatively, maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond what's given. But the example added an assumption not in the original problem. Wait, the original example's problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, they added that n is divisible by 7. That suggests that the answerer might have misread the problem or added an extra condition. That seems like an error. But since the user provided that example, maybe they want similar processing here. However, in the current problem, the user hasn't stated any conditions, so perhaps there are no additional assumptions beyond the problem as stated. But the example added an assumption even if the original problem didn't state it. So maybe I need to infer assumptions from the problem's context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user in the example made a mistake, and the correct assumptions should align with the problem. For the current problem, the sum is over n ≥ 0, so n is a non-negative integer. The problem is to prove the sum equals π over Gamma^4(3/4). Therefore, the assumption is that n is a non-negative integer. Additionally, maybe the Gamma function is evaluated at 3/4, which is valid. But since that's a constant, it's not an assumption. Therefore, the only assumption is that n is a non-negative integer. So:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a non-negative integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}{{2n\\choose n}^3\\over 2^{6n}}={\\pi\\over \\Gamma^4\\left({3\\over 4}\\right)}.$$\n\nBut checking the original problem's LaTeX, the user had a typo: the closing brace for the Gamma^4 is missing in the original. Let me check:\n\nOriginal problem's equation (1): \n$$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}{{2n\\choose n}^3\\over 2^{6n}}={\\pi\\over \\Gamma^4\\left({3\\over 4}\\right)}\\tag1$$\n\nYes, there's a missing closing brace in the Gamma^4(3/4). But in the formatted problem, we should correct that? Or keep it as is? The user might have a typo, but as an assistant, I should present it correctly. However, since the user's example kept the original problem's formatting, perhaps I should replicate it, typos and all. So in the Problem section, we have:\n\nProblem: Prove that $$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}{{2n\\choose n}^3\\over 2^{6n}}={\\pi\\over \\Gamma^4\\left({3\\over 4}\\right)}.$$\n\nBut note that in the original, the equation (1) has a tag, but in the formatted problem, we remove the tag. So following the example, the problem is restated without the tag. Also, check the LaTeX syntax. The original has a missing } in \\Gamma^4\\left({3\\over 4}\\right), it should be \\Gamma^4\\left({3\\over 4}\\right). Wait, no—\\left( and \\right) are for parentheses. The original has \\Gamma^4\\left({3\\over 4}\\right), which is actually correct: \\Gamma^4 is the fourth power, and the argument is 3/4. So \\Gamma^4(3/4) would be written as \\Gamma^4\\left({3\\over 4}\\right) to have larger parentheses, but maybe the user just wrote it as \\Gamma^4(3/4). However, in the original problem, it's written as \\Gamma^4\\left({3\\over 4}\\right), which is correct LaTeX. So no issue there.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have the assumption that n is a non-negative integer, and the problem is to prove the sum equals π over Gamma^4(3/4). So putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a non-negative integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}{{2n\\choose n}^3\\over 2^{6n}}={\\pi\\over \\Gamma^4\\left({3\\over 4}\\right)}.$$\n\nWait, but the original problem's equation (1) has the sum equal to π over Gamma^4(3/4). The user's attempt then references equation (1) again in the note, but that might be a mistake. However, in the formatted problem, we need to present the main problem. So the assumptions would be that n is a non-negative integer, since the sum is from n=0 to infinity. But in the example, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like an error, but following that example, perhaps I need to list the assumptions even if they're not in the original problem. But in this case, the problem is about an infinite sum, so n being a non-negative integer is inherent. However, the example added an assumption not present in the original problem, so maybe the user wants to extract any implicit assumptions. For instance, in the original example, maybe the divisibility by 91 requires n to be divisible by 7, which wasn't stated, so the assistant added it. But in reality, the original example might have an error. However, given that, for the current problem, if there are implicit assumptions, they should be listed. But in this case, I don't see any implicit assumptions beyond n being a non-negative integer. The problem is to prove the identity as stated. Therefore, the only assumption is that n is a non-negative integer, which is part of the summation index. So that's the assumption.",
