    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to format the given problem according to the specified structure. Let me start by understanding the original question from Math Stack Exchange.\n\nThe title is \"How find this determinant $\\det(\\cos^4{(i-j)})_{n\\times n}$\". The user defines a matrix $A_k = (a_{ij}^k)_{n \\times n}$ where each entry $a_{ij} = \\cos(i - j)$. They are specifically asking for the determinant of $A_4$, which is the matrix formed by taking each entry of the original matrix and raising it to the 4th power. The user mentions that they tried calculating it and found that determinants for $A_1$ and $A_2$ are zero, and they suspect that $\\det(A_4) = 0$ when $n \\geq 6$. They need help proving this.\n\nFirst, I need to list all assumptions. The assumptions should be individual properties or conditions applied to one object each. Let's parse the problem:\n\n1. The matrix $A_k$ is defined with entries $a_{ij}^k$, where each $a_{ij} = \\cos(i - j)$ before being raised to the power $k$. Here, $k=4$, so each entry is $\\cos^4(i - j)$.\n2. The size of the matrix is $n \\times n$, and it's specified that $n \\geq 6$.\n3. The problem is to find the determinant of $A_4$, denoted $\\det(A_4)$.\n4. The user already knows that $\\det(A_1) = \\det(A_2) = 0$, which might indicate a pattern, but the key here is the specific case for $k=4$ and $n \\geq 6$.\n\nSo, translating these into assumptions:\n\n- The matrix $A_4$ has entries $a_{ij} = \\cos^4(i - j)$ for each element.\n- The matrix $A_4$ is of size $n \\times n$.\n- $n$ is an integer greater than or equal to 6.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. Now, the problem statement is to prove that the determinant of this specific matrix $A_4$ is zero when $n \\geq 6$.\n\nWait, the user says they suspect $\\det(A_4) = 0$ for $n \\geq 6$. So the problem is to determine the value of the determinant, which they conjecture is zero under the given conditions. The key conditions are the structure of the matrix (entries depending only on i-j, raised to the 4th power) and the size n >=6.\n\nNow, check if there's any other implicit assumption. The matrix is a Toeplitz matrix since each descending diagonal is constant. However, the user might not state that explicitly, so perhaps that's not an assumption but a property. The assumptions should only be what's given in the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n- Each entry of matrix $A_4$ is $\\cos^4(i - j)$.\n- The matrix $A_4$ is an $n \\times n$ matrix.\n- $n$ is an integer greater than or equal to 6.\n\nEach of these is a separate line in the assumption section. The problem is to find the determinant of $A_4$, which the user suspects is zero. So the problem statement is asking for the value of the determinant, with the user's conjecture being zero. But according to the example provided, the problem is phrased as \"Prove that...\". However, in the original question, the user is asking to find the value. The example given in the initial instruction was about proving divisibility, but here it's a determinant. The user's problem is to \"Find the value of det(A4)\", but the user's own try led them to suspect it's zero. So the problem should be structured as \"Find the value of det(A4)\" with the assumptions listed.\n\nHowever, in the example, the problem was restructured to \"Prove that...\", but here the original question is \"Find the value...\". However, the user mentions that they suspect it's zero but can't prove it, so maybe the problem is to prove that determinant is zero for n >=6. So perhaps rephrase the problem as \"Prove that det(A4) = 0 for n >=6\".\n\nBut the original problem says \"Find the value det(A4) = ?\". However, following the example, when the original problem is a proof, the formatted problem becomes \"Prove that...\". Since the user here is asking to find the value but they conjecture it's zero, the problem can be phrased as \"Prove that det(A4) = 0 for n >=6\".\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nAssumptions:\n- Each entry of matrix $A_4$ is $\\cos^4(i - j)$.\n- $A_4$ is an $n \\times n$ matrix.\n- $n$ is an integer greater than or equal to 6.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $\\det(A_4) = 0$ for $n \\geq 6$.\n\nWait, but in the original question, the matrix is defined as $A_k = (a_{ij}^k)_{n \\times n}$ where $a_{ij} = \\cos(i - j)$. So $A_4$ would be the matrix where each entry is $[\\cos(i - j)]^4$, i.e., $\\cos^4(i - j)$. So that's the first assumption.\n\nThe size is n x n, and n >=6. So the second assumption is the matrix is n x n, and third assumption is n >=6.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were written as separate lines for each condition. So:\n\nAssumption:\nEach entry of matrix $A_4$ is $\\cos^4(i - j)$.\n$A_4$ is an $n \\times n$ matrix.\n$n$ is an integer greater than or equal to 6.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $\\det(A_4) = 0$.\n\nAlternatively, to match the example's structure, maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe matrix $A_4$ is defined such that its $(i,j)$-th entry is $\\cos^4(i - j)$.\nThe matrix $A_4$ has size $n \\times n$.\n$n$ is an integer satisfying $n \\geq 6$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $\\det(A_4) = 0$.\n\nYes, this seems correct. Each assumption is a single line, addressing one property or condition of one object. The problem is to prove the determinant is zero. The user's own try mentions that det(A1) and det(A2) are zero, so this is a generalization. The key conditions here are the structure of the matrix (entries depend only on i-j, raised to the fourth power), the size n >=6. So the assumptions are correctly captured.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should look like this.",
