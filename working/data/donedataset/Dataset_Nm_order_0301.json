    "Content": "I've never actually done a delta-epsilon proof, so I thought I'd try my hand at one. I decided to try it out for $f(x)=1/x$. If I understand correctly from the wikipedia article, I want to show for any $\\varepsilon>0$, there exists a $\\delta>0$ such that if $|x-c|<\\delta$, then $|f(x)-f(c)|<\\varepsilon$. Anyway, I noticed that I want something like $$|f(x)-f(c)|= \\left| \\frac{1}{x} - \\frac{1}{c} \\right|=\\frac{|x-c|}{|xc|}<\\varepsilon .$$ So $|x-c|<|xc|\\varepsilon$, which looks similar to the fact that I want $|x-c|<\\delta$. However, I've also heard that one is never supposed to let $\\delta$ depend on $x$. Is this the right direction? How would I use this information to find a corresponding $\\delta$ for each $\\epsilon$? Thanks!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "There have been some confusing comments regarding dependence on $x$ or on $c$, so let me try to put it all together. You are correct that $\\delta$ should not depend on $x$. However, when one is proving that $f(x)$ is continuous at $c$ , then $\\delta$ is allowed to depend on both $\\epsilon$ and $c$. Remember the definition: $f(x)$ is continuous at $c$ if and only for every $\\epsilon\\gt 0$ there exists a $\\delta\\gt 0$ such that for all $x$, if $|x-c|\\lt \\delta$, then $|f(x)-f(c)|\\lt \\epsilon$. Notice how the existence of $\\delta$ is mentioned before $x$ ever comes into the picture? That's an indication that $\\delta$ cannot depend on $x$. On the other hand, both $f(x)$, $\\epsilon$, and $c$ occur before $\\delta$, which means that, absent any indication to the contrary, $\\delta$ is allowed to depend on $f(x)$ (obviously), on $\\epsilon$, and on $c$. So here, you cannot pick $\\delta=|xc|\\epsilon$, because that would make $\\delta$ depend on $x$. The way to get around it is to get rid of the dependence on $x$. The key here is that since we are trying to make sure everything works if $x$ is \"close enough\" to $c$, then we will also have that $|x|$ will be very close to $|c|$. So we should be able to to control that division by $x$ in the expression $\\frac{|x-c|}{|xc|}$. How? Well, if a particular $\\delta_0$ works, then any smaller one will work as well. So we can always shrink $\\delta$ a bit more if needed. Wo the first thing we can note is that we can always require that $\\delta$ be smaller than both $1$ and than $\\frac{c}{2}$; that is, we will require $\\delta\\lt\\min\\{1,\\frac{c}{2}\\}$. Why $1$? Because then I know that $c-1\\lt x \\lt c+1$; if $c-1\\gt 0$, then this means that $\\frac{1}{c+1}\\lt \\frac{1}{x} \\lt \\frac{1}{c-1}$, so we can \"control\" the value of $\\frac{1}{x}$. Why less than $\\frac{c}{2}$? Just in case $c-1\\lt 0$. So let $\\mu=\\min\\{1,\\frac{c}{2}\\}$. Then we can conclude that $\\frac{1}{x}\\lt \\frac{1}{c-\\mu}$. (We could get away with simply putting $\\delta\\lt\\frac{c}{2}$; restricting it to less than $1$ is a common practice, though, which is why I put it here). So, by requiring that $\\delta\\lt\\min\\{1,\\frac{c}{2}\\}$, we guarantee that $\\frac{1}{|x|}\\lt \\frac{1}{c-\\mu}$ (remember that we are working on $(0,\\infty)$). What do we gain by this? Well, look:\n$$|f(x)-f(c)| = \\left|\\frac{1}{x}-\\frac{1}{c}\\right| = \\left|\\frac{c-x}{xc}\\right| = |x-c|\\frac{1}{c}\\cdot\\frac{1}{x} \\leq |x-c|\\frac{1}{c(c-\\mu)}.$$\nSo if we also ask that $\\delta\\lt c(c-\\mu)\\epsilon$, then we have:\n$$|f(x)-f(c)|\\leq |x-c|\\frac{1}{c(c-\\mu)} \\lt \\frac{\\delta}{c(c-\\mu)} \\lt \\frac{c(c-\\mu)\\epsilon}{c(c-\\mu)} = \\epsilon$$\nwhich is what we want! So, in summary, what do we need? We need to make sure that $\\delta$ is: Less than $1$; Less than $\\frac{c}{2}$; (both of these to ensure $\\frac{1}{x}\\lt\\frac{1}{c-\\mu}$); Less than $c(c-\\mu)\\epsilon$, where $\\mu=\\min\\{1,\\frac{c}{2}\\}$. So, for instance, we can just let $\\delta = \\frac{1}{2}\\min(1,\\frac{c}{2},c(c-\\mu)\\epsilon)$, where $\\mu=\\min\\{1,\\frac{c}{2}\\}$. In general, if you can let your $\\delta$ depend only on $f(x)$ and on $\\epsilon$ but not $c$, then we say $f(x)$ is uniformly continuous . This is a stronger condition than continuity, and often very useful. $\\frac{1}{x}$ is not uniformly continuous on $(0,\\infty)$, however (though it is on $[a,\\infty)$ for any $a\\gt 0$).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions and the problem statement from the user's question.\n\nThe title of the question is \"Is $f(x)=1/x$ continuous on $(0,\\infty)$?\" So the main problem is about proving the continuity of the function f(x) = 1/x on the interval (0, ∞). \n\nLooking at the question details, the user is attempting a delta-epsilon proof. They mention they want to show that for any ε > 0, there exists a δ > 0 such that if |x - c| < δ, then |f(x) - f(c)| < ε. They also worked through some steps, getting to |x - c| / |xc| < ε and note that δ might depend on x, which they think is not allowed. They ask how to find δ for each ε.\n\nNow, to list the assumptions. The function in question is f(x) = 1/x. The domain is (0, ∞), so the function is defined there. The problem is about continuity on that interval. The user is using the standard epsilon-delta definition of continuity. The point c is in (0, ∞), but the user is considering continuity at any point c in that interval, not just a specific one. Also, since they mention delta not depending on x, but possibly depending on c, that's important. So assumptions would include the function definition, the domain, and the points considered.\n\nWait, the original example had assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So here, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. The function f is defined by f(x) = 1/x.\n2. The domain of f is (0, ∞).\n3. The continuity is considered at a point c in (0, ∞).\n4. The definition of continuity used is the epsilon-delta criterion.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that f is continuous on the entire interval (0, ∞), which means for every c in (0, ∞), f is continuous at c. So perhaps the assumptions need to include that c is an arbitrary point in the domain.\n\nWait, the example given in the problem had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, the problem is about continuity on (0, ∞), so maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- f(x) = 1/x.\n- The domain of f is (0, ∞).\n- c is a point in (0, ∞).\n- The continuity is to be proven using the epsilon-delta definition.\n\nBut the problem statement in the example was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\", so the problem here is \"Prove that f(x) = 1/x is continuous on (0, ∞)\".\n\nBut in the user's question, they are specifically working through the delta-epsilon proof for f(x) = 1/x. The problem as stated in the title is \"Is f(x)=1/x continuous on (0,∞)?\" So the problem is to determine the continuity, but in the context of the user's attempt, they are trying to construct a proof. The formatted problem should capture the essence.\n\nSo, putting this all together:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The function f is defined by f(x) = 1/x.\n- The domain of f is the interval (0, ∞).\n- The continuity of f is to be analyzed using the epsilon-delta definition.\n- The point c at which continuity is considered is in (0, ∞).\n\nProblem: Prove that f(x) = 1/x is continuous on (0, ∞).\n\nBut wait, in the example, the assumptions included specific conditions on n (being an integer and divisible by 7). Here, the assumptions are more about the function's definition and the domain. Let me check if each assumption is one property or condition applied to one object.\n\n- First assumption: f(x) = 1/x. That's the definition of the function, applied to the function f.\n- Second assumption: domain is (0, ∞). Applies to the domain of f.\n- Third assumption: continuity is analyzed via epsilon-delta. That's about the method used, but maybe not an assumption of the problem itself. Wait, the problem is to prove continuity using the epsilon-delta definition. The original problem in the example didn't include the method as an assumption. So perhaps that's not an assumption but part of the problem statement.\n\nWait, the user is trying to use the epsilon-delta definition, but the problem is to prove continuity, which in calculus is typically done via epsilon-delta. So maybe the assumption is not about the method but rather the context. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key assumptions are:\n\n- f: (0, ∞) → ℝ defined by f(x) = 1/x.\n- c is a point in (0, ∞).\n\nProblem: Prove that f is continuous at c using the epsilon-delta definition. Therefore, the problem is to show for every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for all x in (0, ∞), if |x - c| < δ, then |1/x - 1/c| < ε.\n\nBut the original problem in the example had the problem statement as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" So perhaps here, the problem is \"Prove that f(x) = 1/x is continuous on (0, ∞).\"\n\nBut the user's specific question is about the delta-epsilon proof steps, so maybe the problem statement should be more precise, like \"Prove using the epsilon-delta definition that f(x) = 1/x is continuous at every point c in (0, ∞).\"\n\nBut according to the format, the assumptions should list each condition. Let's see:\n\nAssumption 1: The function f is defined by f(x) = 1/x for all x in (0, ∞).\nAssumption 2: The point c is an element of (0, ∞).\nAssumption 3: The continuity is to be proven using the epsilon-delta definition.\n\nWait, but maybe the third one is part of the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to prove continuity at an arbitrary point c in (0, ∞), hence the assumptions are the function definition and the domain, and the point c being in the domain.\n\nThe example had two assumptions: n is integer, n divisible by 7. Here, maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nf is defined by f(x) = 1/x for x in (0, ∞),\nc is a point in (0, ∞).\n\nProblem:\nProve that f is continuous at c.\n\nAlternatively, since continuity on the entire interval (0, ∞) is equivalent to continuity at every point in the interval, the problem could be stated as \"Prove that f(x) = 1/x is continuous on (0, ∞).\"\n\nBut the user's question is specifically about the delta-epsilon proof, so perhaps the problem is to show the continuity at a point c, which would imply continuity on the entire interval. However, in the example, the problem was stated as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91,\" even though the assumption included n divisible by 7 and n integer. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", and the formatted problem's assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems incorrect. Unless perhaps there was a mistake in the example.\n\nWait, maybe the example is incorrect. If the original problem is to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91, but in the formatted problem, the assumption is that n is divisible by 7, then that would be changing the problem. Hmm. That seems like a mistake. Because if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, then the problem becomes different. So perhaps the example is wrong. But since the user provided that example, we have to follow their structure even if it's flawed.\n\nIn that case, maybe in the current problem, the assumptions would include the function definition, domain, and perhaps some conditions. However, in the current problem, the user is trying to show continuity for all x in (0, ∞), so the assumptions should not restrict the function or domain beyond what's given.\n\nTherefore, the correct assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) = 1/x,\nThe domain of f is (0, ∞),\nContinuity is considered at an arbitrary point c in (0, ∞).\n\nProblem:\nProve that f is continuous at c using the epsilon-delta definition.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is about continuity on the entire interval, but the proof is done pointwise, perhaps the problem statement is \"Prove that f(x) = 1/x is continuous on (0, ∞).\"\n\nBut in the example, assumptions were about the variable (n being integer and divisible by 7), so perhaps here, the assumptions are:\n\n- f(x) = 1/x for x in (0, ∞).\n- c is a point in (0, ∞).\n\nProblem:\nProve that f is continuous at c.\n\nBut the original title is about continuity on the interval, so maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) = 1/x,\nThe domain of f is (0, ∞).\n\nProblem:\nProve that f is continuous on (0, ∞).\n\nBut since continuity on an interval means continuity at every point in the interval, the problem can be framed either way. However, the user's attempt is about proving continuity at a point using epsilon-delta, so perhaps the problem should be to prove continuity at an arbitrary point c in (0, ∞), which then implies continuity on the interval.\n\nGiven that, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nf is defined by f(x) = 1/x for all x ∈ (0, ∞),\nc is a point in (0, ∞).\n\nProblem:\nProve that f is continuous at c.\n\nAlternatively, to match the example, perhaps the assumptions are listed as:\n\nAssumption:\nThe function f is given by f(x) = 1/x,\nThe domain of f is the interval (0, ∞),\nThe point c is in (0, ∞).\n\nProblem:\nProve that f is continuous at c.\n\nYes, this seems correct. Each assumption is a single property applied to one object: function definition applied to f, domain applied to f, and point c in the domain. Then the problem is to prove continuity at c. Since continuity on the entire interval follows from continuity at each point, the problem as stated captures the essence.",
