    "Content": "How can I prove that If $n$ is a positive integer such that\n$$n>8$$\nthen\n$$\\frac{n!-1}{2n+7}$$\nis never an integer?\nSome of the first things that came to my mind is that $n!-1$ is not divisible by all numbers from $2$ to $n$, so if\n$$2n+7<n^2$$\nThat is, $n>3$ then $2n+7$ must be a prime number in order to actually get an integer.

    "AcceptedAnswer": "As you observed, unless $2n+7$ is prime, you get $2n+7|n!$. This is clear, since if $2n+7$ is not prime, you can write it as $2n+7=ab$ and since neither $a$ nor $b$ are 2, both must be less than $n$. As Jonas pointed, if $a \\neq b$ the conclusion is immediate, while if $a=b$ we have $a^2=2n+7$ and one can easily conclude that $2a \\leq n$. So lets cover the case $p=2n+7$ is prime. Then $n=\\frac{p-7}{2}=\\frac{p-1}{2}-3$. Then you get $$n! \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$$ thus $$(\\frac{p-1}{2}-3)! \\equiv 1 \\pmod p \\,.$$\n$$(\\frac{p-1}{2})! \\equiv \\frac{p-5}{2}\\frac{p-3}{2}\\frac{p-1}{2} \\equiv 8^{-1}(-15) \\pmod p \\,.$$ Square both sides: $$[(\\frac{p-1}{2})!]^2 \\equiv 64^{-1}(15)^2 \\pmod p \\,.$$ The LHS is exactly $(p-1)! (-1)^{\\frac{p-1}{2}}$. Thus $$(-1)^{\\frac{p+1}{2}} \\equiv 64^{-1}(15)^2 \\pmod p \\,,$$ or $$\\pm 64 \\equiv 225 \\pmod p$$ This means that $p$ is a divisor of $225 \\pm 64$. Note that $p=2n+7>23$. This reduces the problem to few cases to check.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The question is to prove that for any positive integer n > 8, the expression (n! - 1)/(2n + 7) is not an integer. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem fully. We have a fraction where the numerator is n! minus 1, and the denominator is 2n + 7. We need to show that this fraction is never an integer when n is greater than 8. \n\nThe user mentioned they thought about how n! - 1 isn't divisible by numbers from 2 to n. That makes sense because n! is divisible by all integers up to n, so subtracting 1 would make it leave a remainder of -1 when divided by any of those numbers. Hence, n! - 1 is congruent to -1 modulo any number from 2 to n. So if 2n + 7 is a prime number, maybe there's a way to apply Wilson's theorem here. But the user tried that without success. Let me think.\n\nThey also noted that if 2n + 7 < n², which holds when n > 3, then 2n + 7 must be prime for the fraction to be an integer. Wait, why is that? If 2n + 7 is composite, then its prime factors would be less than or equal to its square root. If 2n + 7 is composite, then it must have a prime factor p such that p ≤ sqrt(2n + 7). But since n > 8, 2n +7 is at least 25 (when n=9, 2*9 +7=25). So sqrt(25)=5. So if 2n +7 is composite, it must have a prime factor ≤5. But n >8, so n ≥9, so 2n+7 ≥25. Wait, but primes less than or equal to 5 are 2,3,5. So if 2n +7 is composite, it must be divisible by 2, 3, or 5. Let me check if 2n +7 can be divisible by 2,3,5.\n\nIf 2n +7 is even, then 2n must be odd, which would mean n is not an integer, but n is a positive integer, so 2n +7 is always odd. Because 2n is even, even +7 (odd) is odd. So 2n +7 is odd, so not divisible by 2. So the possible prime factors are 3 or 5.\n\nSo if 2n +7 is composite, it must be divisible by 3 or 5. Let's check when 2n +7 is divisible by 3 or 5.\n\nCase 1: 2n +7 ≡0 mod 3. Then 2n ≡ -7 mod 3 ⇒ 2n ≡ -7 + 9 = 2 mod 3 ⇒ 2n ≡2 mod3 ⇒n ≡1 mod3.\n\nSimilarly, Case 2: 2n +7 ≡0 mod5. Then 2n ≡-7 mod5 ⇒2n ≡-7 +10=3 mod5 ⇒2n ≡3 mod5 ⇒Multiply both sides by inverse of 2 mod5, which is 3, since 2*3=6≡1 mod5. Thus n ≡3*3=9≡4 mod5. So n ≡4 mod5.\n\nTherefore, if 2n +7 is composite, then n must be ≡1 mod3 or ≡4 mod5. But in these cases, 2n +7 would be divisible by 3 or 5, respectively. Let me check if in such cases, (n! -1) is divisible by 3 or 5.\n\nWait, n! is divisible by 3 and 5 for n ≥5. Therefore, n! ≡0 mod3 and mod5. Hence, n! -1 ≡ -1 mod3 and mod5. Therefore, if 2n +7 is divisible by 3 or 5, then n! -1 ≡ -1 mod3 or mod5, which would imply that (n! -1) ≡-1 mod (3 or 5), hence (n! -1)/(2n +7) would not be an integer because the numerator is not divisible by 3 or 5, but the denominator is. Therefore, if 2n +7 is composite, the fraction isn't an integer.\n\nTherefore, the only possible case where the fraction could be an integer is if 2n +7 is prime. So, if 2n +7 is prime, then we need to check whether n! -1 is divisible by 2n +7. \n\nBut if 2n +7 is prime, let's denote p = 2n +7. Then p is a prime number. Since p =2n +7, we can write n = (p -7)/2. Now, Wilson's theorem states that (p-1)! ≡ -1 mod p. Let's see if we can relate n! to (p-1)!.\n\nGiven that n = (p -7)/2, then p = 2n +7. Let's compute (p -1)! = (2n +6)! = (2n +6)(2n +5)...(n +1)(n)(n -1)...2*1.\n\nBut n = (p -7)/2, so (p -1)! = (2n +6)! = (2*(n) +6)! = (2n +6)!.\n\nBut this might not directly relate to n!. However, perhaps we can manipulate Wilson's theorem. Since (p -1)! ≡ -1 mod p. So, (2n +6)! ≡ -1 mod (2n +7). If we can relate (2n +6)! to n!, perhaps through some factorial properties. But 2n +6 is much larger than n, so n! is a factor of (2n +6)!.\n\nBut maybe there's another way. Let's consider the expression n! -1 modulo p. If n! ≡1 mod p, then (n! -1) ≡0 mod p, which would mean p divides (n! -1). So if n! ≡1 mod p, then the fraction is an integer. Otherwise, it's not. So we need to show that n! ≡1 mod p is impossible when p=2n +7 and n >8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can apply Wilson's theorem here. Let's think: If p is prime, then (p-1)! ≡ -1 mod p. Let's express (p-1)! in terms of n. Since p =2n +7, then p -1 =2n +6. So (2n +6)! ≡ -1 mod p. If we can relate (2n +6)! to n!, maybe through some modular inverses or properties.\n\nBut (2n +6)! = (2n +6)(2n +5)...(n +7)(n +6)...(n +1)(n!)).\n\nBut since p =2n +7, which is a prime, then in the factorial (2n +6)!, all terms from 1 up to 2n +6 are included. However, since p =2n +7 is prime, none of the terms from 1 to 2n +6 are multiples of p, except possibly p itself, but p =2n +7, which is greater than 2n +6. So (2n +6)! is ≡ -1 mod p by Wilson's theorem. So (2n +6)! ≡ -1 mod p.\n\nBut how does that relate to n! ?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can split the factorial into two parts. Let me think: (2n +6)! = (n +6)! * (n +7)(n +8)...(2n +6). But not sure. Alternatively, considering that p =2n +7, so in modulo p, numbers from n +7 to 2n +6 are congruent to -(2n +7 - (n +7)) to -1, which is -(n) to -1. So (2n +6)! = (n +6)! * (n +7)(n +8)...(2n +6) ≡ (n +6)! * (-n)(-n +1)...(-1) mod p.\n\nTherefore, (n +7)(n +8)...(2n +6) ≡ (-n)(-n +1)...(-1) mod p.\n\nThis is because n +7 = p - (n +7 - p) = p - (n +7 - (2n +7)) = p - (-n) = p +n, which is ≡n mod p. Wait, no. Wait, p=2n+7, so n = (p-7)/2. Let me compute n +7 = (p-7)/2 +7 = (p-7 +14)/2 = (p +7)/2. Similarly, n +k = (p-7)/2 +k. It might get complicated. Alternatively, consider that for k from 1 to n +6, the terms in (n +7) to (2n +6) can be written as p - (n +6) to p -1. Since p=2n+7, then p - (n +6) =2n +7 -n -6 =n +1. So (n +7)(n +8)...(2n +6) ≡ (n +1)(n +2)...(2n +6) ≡ (p - (n +6))... (p -1) ≡ (-1)^(n +6) * (n +6)! mod p. Because each term p -k ≡ -k mod p. So (p -k) ≡-k mod p. Therefore, the product from k= n +1 to k=2n +6 (which is p -1) is equivalent to (-1)^{number of terms} multiplied by the product of k from n +1 to p -1.\n\nWait, but p -1 =2n +6, so the terms from n +7 to 2n +6 are (n +7)(n +8)...(2n +6). Let's compute how many terms there are. From n +7 to 2n +6: 2n +6 - (n +7) +1 =n -0 terms. Wait, 2n +6 -n -7 +1= n -0. Hmm, not sure. Let's plug in n=9: p=2*9+7=25, so p-1=24. Then terms from n+7=16 to 24: 16 to24, which is 9 terms. n=9, 9 terms. So in general, from n +7 to 2n +6, there are (2n +6) - (n +7) +1 =n terms. So the product is (n +7)(n +8)...(2n +6) = product_{k=1}^n (n +6 +k). But how does this relate to modulo p?\n\nAlternatively, since p=2n +7, then n=(p-7)/2. So n +7 = (p-7)/2 +7 = (p +7)/2. So the terms go from (p +7)/2 to p -1. Let's take an example. If p=25 (n=9), then terms are 16 to24. Each of these terms is congruent to -9 to -1 modulo 25. Because 16 ≡ -9 mod25 (25-9=16), 17≡-8, ...,24≡-1. So the product from16 to24 is (-9)(-8)...(-1) mod25. Which is (-1)^9 *9! mod25. So in general, the product from (p +7)/2 to p -1 is equivalent to (-1)^{n} multiplied by (n +6)! mod p. Wait, but in the example, n=9, p=25, the number of terms is9, which is n. So in general, the product from (n +7) to (2n +6) is equal to (-1)^n * (n +6)! mod p. Because each term is p -k where k runs from (n +1) to (2n +6), but this might need more precise analysis.\n\nBut let's proceed. So, (2n +6)! = [1*2*...*(n +6)] * [(n +7)*...*(2n +6)] ≡ (n +6)! * (-1)^n * (n +6)! mod p. Wait, no. Wait, in the example, p=25, n=9, the product from16 to24 ≡ (-1)^9 *9! mod25. But 9! is different from (n +6)! which for n=9 would be 15!.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me clarify. For p=2n +7, the terms from (n +7) to (2n +6) are p - (n +6 -k) for k from1 ton? Not sure. Alternatively, let's note that (n +7) = p - (n +7 - p) = p - (n +7 - (2n +7)) = p - (-n) = p +n. But modulo p, this is n. Wait, that can't be. Wait, p=2n +7, so n=(p-7)/2. Then n +7= (p-7)/2 +7= (p-7 +14)/2= (p +7)/2. So n +7= (p +7)/2. Similarly, n +8= (p +7)/2 +1= (p +9)/2, and so on up to 2n +6=2*((p-7)/2) +6= p -7 +6= p -1. So the terms from n +7 to2n +6 are from (p +7)/2 to p -1. Each of these terms can be written as p - k where k runs from1 to (p -1 - (p +7)/2 +1). Let's compute the number of terms: p -1 - (p +7)/2 +1= (p -1 -p/2 -7/2 +1)= (p/2 -7/2). But since p=2n +7, substituting gives ( (2n +7)/2 -7/2 )=n. So there are n terms. Each term is p -k where k= (p -1) - (n +7) +1= p -1 -n -7 +1= p -n -7= (2n +7) -n -7= n. Wait, this is getting too convoluted. Let's try with an example again. Take p=25 (n=9). The terms from16 to24 are 16,17,...,24. These can be written as25 -9,25 -8,...,25 -1. So each term is25 -k wherek=9 downto1. So the product is(-9)*(-8)*...*(-1)= (-1)^9 *9!. Which is -9! mod25. So in general, the product from(n +7) to(2n +6) is (-1)^n *n! modp. Because when p=2n +7, the number of terms is n, and each term is p -k wherek=1 ton, so the product is(-1)^n *n! modp.\n\nWait, but in the example, it was (-1)^9 *9! mod25. But n=9, so (-1)^n *n! = (-1)^9 *9! which matches. So in general, (n +7)(n +8)...(2n +6) ≡(-1)^n *n! modp.\n\nTherefore, (2n +6)! ≡ (n +6)! * (-1)^n *n! modp.\n\nBut by Wilson's theorem, (2n +6)! ≡-1 modp.\n\nSo, (n +6)! * (-1)^n *n! ≡-1 modp.\n\nLet's rearrange this:\n\n(n +6)! *n! ≡ (-1)^{n +1} modp.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. But maybe we can relate this to n! -1. Our goal is to check if n! ≡1 modp. If that were the case, then we can substitute n! ≡1 into the equation.\n\nAssume n! ≡1 modp. Then:\n\n(n +6)! *1 ≡ (-1)^{n +1} modp.\n\nBut (n +6)! = (n +6)(n +5)...(n +1)n!.\n\nSince n! ≡1 modp, then (n +6)! ≡(n +6)(n +5)...(n +1)*1 modp.\n\nBut p=2n +7, so n=(p -7)/2. Let's express n +k in terms of p:\n\nn +k=(p -7)/2 +k=(p -7 +2k)/2.\n\nFor k=1 to6:\n\nn +1=(p -7 +2)/2=(p -5)/2,\n\nn +2=(p -7 +4)/2=(p -3)/2,\n\nn +3=(p -7 +6)/2=(p -1)/2,\n\nn +4=(p -7 +8)/2=(p +1)/2,\n\nn +5=(p -7 +10)/2=(p +3)/2,\n\nn +6=(p -7 +12)/2=(p +5)/2.\n\nSo (n +6)! = product fromk=1 to6 (n +k) *n!.\n\nBut n! ≡1 modp, so:\n\n(n +6)! ≡ [ (p -5)/2 * (p -3)/2 * (p -1)/2 * (p +1)/2 * (p +3)/2 * (p +5)/2 ] modp.\n\nEach term here can be simplified modulo p. For example, (p -5)/2 ≡ -5/2 modp, similarly for others. So:\n\n(p -5)/2 ≡ -5/2,\n\n(p -3)/2 ≡ -3/2,\n\n(p -1)/2 ≡ -1/2,\n\n(p +1)/2 ≡1/2,\n\n(p +3)/2 ≡3/2,\n\n(p +5)/2 ≡5/2.\n\nTherefore, the product becomes:\n\n(-5/2)(-3/2)(-1/2)(1/2)(3/2)(5/2) = [(-5)(-3)(-1)(1)(3)(5)] / (2^6) = [(-1)^3 *5*3*1*3*5]/64 = [ -225 ] /64.\n\nSo (n +6)! ≡ -225/64 modp.\n\nTherefore, the equation from Wilson's theorem becomes:\n\n(n +6)! *n! ≡ (-225/64)*1 ≡ -225/64 ≡ (-1)^{n +1} modp.\n\nBut we need to see if this is possible. However, this seems too vague. Let's try with specific values. Take n=9, p=25. Then:\n\n(n +6)! =15!.\n\nBut 15! mod25: We can compute 15! = 15×14×13×12×11×10×9×8×7×6×5×4×3×2×1. Note that 10 and 5 and 15 contribute factors of5. 15! includes multiple factors of5, so 15! ≡0 mod25. Wait, but earlier steps suggested otherwise. There's a contradiction here. So perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, when p=25 (n=9), we have (n +6)! =15! But 15! is divisible by25, so 15! ≡0 mod25. But according to the earlier equation from Wilson's theorem: (2n +6)! =24! ≡-1 mod25. But 24! ≡-1 mod25 by Wilson's theorem. However, (n +6)! * (-1)^n *n! =15! * (-1)^9 *9! ≡0 * (-1)^9 *9! ≡0 mod25, which contradicts 24! ≡-1 mod25. Therefore, there must be an error in my previous reasoning.\n\nAh, I see. The mistake arises because when p is not a prime, Wilson's theorem doesn't apply, but in our case, p is supposed to be prime when we're considering the case where 2n +7 is prime. Wait, but in the example, p=25 is not prime, which contradicts the assumption. Wait, no, if we're in the case where 2n +7 is prime, then p must be prime. So for p=25, which is composite, we shouldn't be in that case. Therefore, taking n=9 (p=25) is not in the case where p is prime. So maybe take n=10, then p=2*10+7=27, which is composite. n=11: p=29, which is prime. So let's take n=11, p=29.\n\nThen, n=11, p=29. (2n +6)! =28! ≡-1 mod29 by Wilson's theorem. Also, (n +6)! =17!.\n\nNow, according to the earlier equation:\n\n(n +6)! * (-1)^n *n! ≡-1 mod29.\n\nSo 17! * (-1)^11 *11! ≡-1 mod29.\n\nLet's compute 17! * (-1)^11 *11! mod29.\n\nFirst, 11! mod29: compute 11! =39916800. But we can compute it step by step:\n\n1*2=2\n\n2*3=6\n\n6*4=24\n\n24*5=120≡120-4*29=120-116=4 mod29\n\n4*6=24\n\n24*7=168≡168-5*29=168-145=23 mod29\n\n23*8=184≡184-6*29=184-174=10 mod29\n\n10*9=90≡90-3*29=90-87=3 mod29\n\n3*10=30≡1 mod29\n\n1*11=11 mod29.\n\nSo 11! ≡11 mod29.\n\nNow, 17! mod29. Note that 17! = (29 -12)! =17! ≡(-1)^{12} *12!^{-1} mod29 by Wilson's theorem extension: (p -k -1)! ≡ (-1)^{k+1}/(k!) modp. Wait, maybe better to use the property that (p -1)! ≡-1 modp, and (p -1)(p -2)...(p -k) ≡(-1)^k k! modp.\n\nAlternatively, since17! *18*19*...*28 ≡28! ≡-1 mod29. But 28! = (29 -1)! ≡-1 mod29.\n\nSo 17! *18*19*...*28 ≡-1 mod29.\n\nBut 18 to28 are 11 numbers. Let's compute their product modulo29.\n\n18 ≡-11, 19≡-10,20≡-9,21≡-8,22≡-7,23≡-6,24≡-5,25≡-4,26≡-3,27≡-2,28≡-1.\n\nSo the product is (-11)*(-10)*(-9)*...*(-1) = (-1)^11 *11! ≡-11! mod29.\n\nThus, 17! * (-11!) ≡-1 mod29 ⇒17! ≡-1 * (-11!)^{-1} mod29.\n\nFrom earlier, 11! ≡11 mod29. Therefore, 17! ≡-1 * (11)^{-1} mod29.\n\nWe need to find the inverse of11 mod29. Since11*8=88≡88-3*29=88-87=1 mod29. So 11^{-1}≡8 mod29.\n\nThus,17!≡-1 *8= -8≡21 mod29.\n\nSo 17! ≡21 mod29.\n\nNow, back to the equation:17! * (-1)^11 *11! ≡21 * (-1)^11 *11 mod29.\n\n21 * (-1) *11=21*(-11)= -231.\n\n-231 mod29: 29*7=203, 29*8=232. So -231 +232=1 mod29. So -231≡1 mod29.\n\nBut according to the equation, it should be ≡-1 mod29. Contradiction. Wait, this suggests a mistake in my earlier steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps my approach is flawed. Let's step back.\n\nGiven that p=2n +7 is prime, we need to check if n! ≡1 modp. If yes, then (n! -1)/p is integer. If not, then it's not. So we need to show that for p=2n +7 prime and n >8, n! ≡1 modp is impossible.\n\nBut how?\n\nMaybe using properties of factorial modulo primes. For example, Wilson's theorem says (p-1)!≡-1 modp. If we can relate n! to (p-1)!.\n\nSince p=2n +7, then (p -1)=2n +6. So (p -1)! = (2n +6)!.\n\nLet me express (2n +6)! in terms of n!.\n\n(2n +6)! = (2n +6)(2n +5)...(n +7)(n +6)!.\n\nBut p=2n +7, so n=(p-7)/2. Let me substitute n=(p-7)/2 into the expression.\n\nThus, (p-1)! = [2*( (p-7)/2 ) +6]! = (p -7 +6)! = (p -1)!.\n\nWait, that doesn't help. Let's try to express (2n +6)! as (p -1)!.\n\nThen, (p -1)! ≡-1 modp by Wilson's theorem.\n\nBut (p -1)! = (2n +6)! = (n +6)! * (n +7)(n +8)...(2n +6).\n\nAs before, the product (n +7)(n +8)...(2n +6) can be written in terms of negative numbers modulo p. Let's denote each term as p -k for k=1 ton.\n\nSo (n +7)(n +8)...(2n +6) ≡ (-1)^n *n! modp.\n\nTherefore, (p -1)! ≡ (n +6)! * (-1)^n *n! ≡-1 modp.\n\nSo, (n +6)! * (-1)^n *n! ≡-1 modp.\n\nRearranged: n! * (n +6)! ≡ (-1)^{n+1} modp.\n\nIf we can express (n +6)! in terms of n!.\n\nBut n +6 = (p -7)/2 +6 = (p -7 +12)/2 = (p +5)/2.\n\nSo (n +6)! = product_{k=1}^{(p +5)/2} k.\n\nThis might not help directly. Alternatively, consider that for p=2n +7, which is a prime greater than2n +7 when n>8, p is at least25 (n=9 gives p=25, but p must be prime, so n=11 gives p=29). So p is an odd prime greater than or equal to29.\n\nAssuming p is a prime, and we have the equation n! * (n +6)! ≡ (-1)^{n+1} modp.\n\nOur goal is to check if n! ≡1 modp. Suppose n! ≡1 modp. Then substituting into the equation:\n\n1 * (n +6)! ≡ (-1)^{n+1} modp ⇒ (n +6)! ≡ (-1)^{n+1} modp.\n\nBut (n +6)! = (n +6)(n +5)...(n +1)n!.\n\nSince n! ≡1 modp, this becomes:\n\n(n +6)(n +5)...(n +1) *1 ≡ (-1)^{n+1} modp.\n\nBut the product (n +1)(n +2)...(n +6) is equal to the product of6 consecutive integers starting fromn +1. This product can be related to a factorial or divided by some terms, but it's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, we can write this product as (n +6)! /n!.\n\nBut since n! ≡1 modp, then (n +6)! ≡ (n +6)! /n! *n! ≡ product_{k=1}^6 (n +k) *1 modp.\n\nSo (n +6)! ≡ (n +1)(n +2)...(n +6) modp.\n\nBut we have (n +6)! ≡ (-1)^{n+1} modp.\n\nTherefore, (n +1)(n +2)...(n +6) ≡ (-1)^{n+1} modp.\n\nNow, we need to compute this product modulo p.\n\nLet's express each term in terms of p:\n\nn +k = (p -7)/2 +k = (2k -7 +p)/2.\n\nBut modulo p, this is (2k -7)/2.\n\nSo the product becomes:\n\nprod_{k=1}^6 (2k -7)/2 modp.\n\nSo, [(2*1 -7)/2 * (2*2 -7)/2 * ... * (2*6 -7)/2] modp.\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nFor k=1: (2 -7)/2 = (-5)/2\n\nk=2: (4 -7)/2 = (-3)/2\n\nk=3: (6 -7)/2 = (-1)/2\n\nk=4: (8 -7)/2 =1/2\n\nk=5: (10 -7)/2 =3/2\n\nk=6: (12 -7)/2 =5/2\n\nSo the product is [(-5/2)(-3/2)(-1/2)(1/2)(3/2)(5/2)] modp.\n\nThis equals [ (-5)(-3)(-1)(1)(3)(5) ] / (2^6) = [ (-1)^3 * 225 ] /64 = (-225)/64 modp.\n\nThus, (n +1)(n +2)...(n +6) ≡ -225/64 modp.\n\nTherefore, according to the earlier equation:\n\n-225/64 ≡ (-1)^{n+1} modp.\n\nMultiply both sides by64:\n\n-225 ≡ (-1)^{n+1} *64 modp.\n\nRearranged:\n\n(-1)^{n} *64 ≡225 modp.\n\nBut 64 and225 can be expressed as64=2^6 and225=15^2=3^2*5^2.\n\nSo, depending on n's parity, we have:\n\nIf n is even: 64 ≡225 modp ⇒225 -64=161 ≡0 modp ⇒p divides161.\n\nBut161=7*23. Therefore, p must be7 or23. But p=2n +7. If p=7, then2n +7=7⇒n=0, which is invalid since n>8. If p=23, then2n +7=23⇒n=8, but the problem requiresn>8. Hence, n=8 is excluded. Therefore, no solutions when n is even.\n\nIf n is odd: -64 ≡225 modp ⇒225 +64=289≡0 modp ⇒p divides289. But289=17^2. Hence, p=17. Then2n +7=17⇒n=5, which is again less than8. So no solutions here either.\n\nThus, in either case, there are no primes p=2n +7 withn>8 that satisfy the equation. Therefore, the assumption thatn! ≡1 modp leads to a contradiction because it would requirep to divide161 or289, which are not of the form2n +7 withn>8. Hence, there are no such primes p wheren! ≡1 modp whenn>8. Therefore, (n! -1)/ (2n +7) cannot be an integer for n>8.\n\nHence, combining both cases where2n +7 is composite or prime, the fraction is never an integer for n>8.",
