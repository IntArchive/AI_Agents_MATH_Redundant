    "Content": "A problem on my (last week's) real analysis homework boiled down to proving that, for $a>-1$,\n$$\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\frac{(n-1)!}{n\\prod\\limits_{i=1}^n(a+i)}=\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(a+k)^2}.$$ Mathematica confirms this is true, but I couldn't even prove the convergence of the original series (the one on the left), much less demonstrate that it equaled this other sum; the ratio test is inconclusive, and the root test and others seem hopeless. It was (and is) quite a  frustrating problem. Can someone explain how to go about tackling this?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This uses a reliable trick with the Beta function.  I say reliable because you can use the beta function and switching of the integral and sum to solve many series very quickly. First notice that $$\\prod_{i=1}^{n}(a+i)=\\frac{\\Gamma(n+a+1)}{\\Gamma(a+1)}.$$ Then $$\\frac{(n-1)!}{\\prod_{i=1}^{n}(a+i)}=\\frac{\\Gamma(n)\\Gamma(a+1)}{\\Gamma(n+a+1)}=\\text{B}(n,a+1)=\\int_{0}^{1}(1-x)^{n-1}x{}^{a}dx.$$ Hence, upon switching the order we have that $$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{(n-1)!}{n\\prod_{i=1}^{n}(a+i)}=\\int_{0}^{1}x^{a}\\left(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{(1-x)^{n-1}}{n}\\right)dx.$$ Recognizing the power series, this is  $$\\int_{0}^{1}x^{a}\\frac{-\\log x}{1-x}dx.$$ Now, expand the power series for $\\frac{1}{1-x}$  to get $$\\sum_{m=0}^{\\infty}-\\int_{0}^{1}x^{a+m}\\log xdx.$$ It is not difficult to see that $$-\\int_{0}^{1}x^{a+m}\\log xdx=\\frac{1}{(a+m+1)^{2}},$$ so we conclude that $$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{(n-1)!}{n\\prod_{i=1}^{n}(a+i)}=\\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{(a+m)^{2}}.$$ Hope that helps, Remark: To evaluate the earlier integral, notice that $$-\\int_{0}^{1}x^{r}\\log xdx=\\int_{1}^{\\infty}x^{-(r+2)}\\log xdx=\\int_{0}^{\\infty}e^{-u(r+1)}udu=\\frac{1}{(r+1)^{2}}\\int_{0}^{\\infty}e^{-u}udu. $$  Alternatively, as Joriki pointed out, you can just use integration by parts.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants to prove that for a > -1, the series sum from n=1 to infinity of (n-1)! divided by [n times the product from i=1 to n of (a+i)] equals the sum from k=1 to infinity of 1/(a+k)^2. Hmm. Both sides involve infinite sums, so maybe there's a way to relate the terms or transform one into the other.\n\nFirst, let's understand the left-hand side (LHS). The term inside the sum is (n-1)! / [n * product_{i=1}^n (a+i)]. The product in the denominator is a product of (a+1) up to (a+n). That product can be written as (a+1)(a+2)...(a+n). So the denominator is n times that product. The numerator is (n-1)!.\n\nLet me see if I can rewrite that term. The product (a+1)(a+2)...(a+n) is similar to a Pochhammer symbol or rising factorial. In terms of Gamma functions, the product is Gamma(a+n+1)/Gamma(a+1). But maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, note that (n-1)! / [n * product_{i=1}^n (a+i)] = (n-1)! / [n * (a+1)(a+2)...(a+n)].\n\nWait, perhaps this fraction can be expressed in terms of beta functions or integrals. The Gamma function and Beta function relation might be useful here. Remember that Beta(m, n) = Integral_0^1 t^{m-1}(1-t)^{n-1} dt = Gamma(m)Gamma(n)/Gamma(m+n). Maybe integrating something here.\n\nAlternatively, consider expanding the product or using partial fractions. Let's look at the term (n-1)! / [n * product_{i=1}^n (a+i)]. Let's denote the denominator as n * (a+1)(a+2)...(a+n). The numerator is (n-1)!.\n\nLet me see if this term can be rewritten. Let's note that (a+1)(a+2)...(a+n) = Gamma(a+n+1)/Gamma(a+1). But I'm not sure if that's helpful yet. Alternatively, (n-1)! / [n * product_{i=1}^n (a+i)] = (n-1)! / [n * product_{i=1}^n (a+i)] = [ (n-1)! / n! ) ] * [n! / (n * product_{i=1}^n (a+i)) ) ] = (1/n) * [n! / (n * product_{i=1}^n (a+i)) ] = (1/n^2) * [ (n-1)! / product_{i=1}^n (a+i) ) ].\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me compute for small n. For n=1: (0)! / [1 * (a+1)] = 1 / (a+1). But the right-hand side (RHS) when n=1 is 1/(a+1)^2. Wait, but the LHS sum starts at n=1, so the first term is 1/(a+1). The RHS sum starts at k=1, so the first term is 1/(a+1)^2. That doesn't match. Hmm. Wait, but when n=1, the LHS term is 0!/(1*(a+1)) = 1/(1*(a+1)) = 1/(a+1). The sum on the LHS would start with 1/(a+1) + next terms. The RHS is the sum of 1/(a+k)^2 for k=1 to infinity. So the first terms aren't equal, but maybe when summed, they become equal. So maybe telescoping or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the LHS can be represented as an integral. The presence of factorials and products often relates to Beta functions. Let me recall that 1/(product_{i=1}^n (a+i)) can be expressed as an integral. For example, 1/(a+1)(a+2)...(a+n) might be connected to an integral over [0,1] involving t^a or something.\n\nAlternatively, consider generating functions. Maybe the sum on the LHS can be expressed as a generating function which can be manipulated to match the RHS.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's consider the term (n-1)! / [n * product_{i=1}^n (a+i)]. Let's write this as 1/(n * (a+1)(a+2)...(a+n) / (n-1)!)). The denominator can be written as n * (a+1)(a+2)...(a+n) / (n-1)! = n * (a+1)(a+2)...(a+n)/(n-1)! ). Let me see: (a+1)(a+2)...(a+n) is the same as (a+1)_n, the Pochhammer symbol. So (a+1)_n = Gamma(a+n+1)/Gamma(a+1). So the term becomes (n-1)! / [n * (a+1)_n]. Which is (n-1)! / [n * Gamma(a+n+1)/Gamma(a+1)) ] = Gamma(a+1) * (n-1)! / [n * Gamma(a+n+1)].\n\nBut Gamma(n) = (n-1)!, so Gamma(a+n+1) = (a+n)(a+n-1)...(a+1)Gamma(a+1). Wait, but maybe this is not helpful. Alternatively, writing in terms of Beta functions: Beta(n, a+1) = Gamma(n)Gamma(a+1)/Gamma(n+a+1) = (n-1)! Gamma(a+1)/Gamma(n+a+1). So Gamma(a+1) (n-1)! / Gamma(n+a+1) = Beta(n, a+1). So our term is Beta(n, a+1) / n. Therefore, the LHS term is Beta(n, a+1)/n.\n\nBut Beta(n, a+1) is the integral from 0 to 1 of t^{n-1} (1 - t)^{a} dt. So, Beta(n, a+1) = ∫₀¹ t^{n-1} (1 - t)^a dt. Therefore, the term becomes [∫₀¹ t^{n-1} (1 - t)^a dt] / n.\n\nTherefore, the entire LHS sum is sum_{n=1}^∞ [∫₀¹ t^{n-1} (1 - t)^a dt] / n.\n\nPerhaps we can interchange the sum and the integral. If that's allowed, then the LHS becomes ∫₀¹ (1 - t)^a sum_{n=1}^∞ [t^{n-1}/n] dt. Let's compute the sum inside: sum_{n=1}^∞ t^{n-1}/n = (1/t) sum_{n=1}^∞ t^n /n = (1/t) * (-ln(1 - t)) for |t| < 1. So, sum_{n=1}^∞ t^{n}/n = -ln(1 - t), so dividing by t gives -ln(1 - t)/t.\n\nTherefore, the LHS becomes ∫₀¹ (1 - t)^a * (-ln(1 - t)/t) dt. So, ∫₀¹ (1 - t)^a (-ln(1 - t)/t) dt. Let me change variables: let u = 1 - t, then when t=0, u=1; t=1, u=0. So, dt = -du. The integral becomes ∫₁⁰ u^a (-ln u / (1 - u)) (-du) = ∫₀¹ u^a (ln u / (u - 1)) du. Hmm, but (u - 1) is negative, so ln u / (u - 1) = -ln u / (1 - u). So the integral is ∫₀¹ u^a (-ln u)/(1 - u) du.\n\nAlternatively, ∫₀¹ u^a [ -ln u / (1 - u) ] du. Let me write this as ∫₀¹ u^a [ ln(1/u) / (1 - u) ] du. Hmm. Maybe expand 1/(1 - u) as a geometric series. Since 1/(1 - u) = sum_{k=0}^∞ u^k for |u| < 1. Then the integral becomes ∫₀¹ u^a ln(1/u) sum_{k=0}^\\infty u^k du = sum_{k=0}^\\infty ∫₀¹ u^{a + k} ln(1/u) du.\n\nInterchange sum and integral, assuming convergence. Then each integral is ∫₀¹ u^{a + k} (-ln u) du. Let’s compute this integral. Let’s make substitution: let t = -(a + k + 1) ln u, then u = e^{-t/(a + k +1)}, but maybe better to use Gamma function. Remember that ∫₀¹ u^c (-ln u) du = Γ(2)/(c + 1)^2 = 1/(c + 1)^2. Wait, more accurately, the integral ∫₀^∞ t e^{-pt} dt = 1/p² for p > 0, but here the limits are from 0 to 1. Wait, let me compute ∫₀¹ u^c (-ln u) du. Let’s set t = -ln u, so u = e^{-t}, du = -e^{-t} dt. When u=0, t=∞; u=1, t=0. Then the integral becomes ∫∞⁰ (e^{-c t}) (-t) (-e^{-t} dt) = ∫₀^∞ t e^{-(c + 1)t} dt = Γ(2)/(c + 1)^2 = 1/(c + 1)^2. So yes, ∫₀¹ u^c (-ln u) du = 1/(c + 1)^2.\n\nTherefore, our integral ∫₀¹ u^{a + k} (-ln u) du = 1/(a + k + 1)^2.\n\nTherefore, the LHS sum becomes sum_{k=0}^\\infty 1/(a + k + 1)^2 = sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(a + m)^2 where m = k + 1. Which is exactly the RHS sum. Hence, the equality is proven.\n\nSo the key steps were recognizing the term as a Beta function, interchanging the sum and integral, expanding 1/(1 - u) as a geometric series, computing the resulting integral via substitution, and recognizing the resulting sum as the RHS. This shows that the two sides are equal.",
