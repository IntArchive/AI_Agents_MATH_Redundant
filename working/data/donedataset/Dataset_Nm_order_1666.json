    "Content": "By educated guessing, inspired by this solution of $\\int_0^\\infty\\frac {\\tanh^3(x)}{x^2}dx$ , I have found numerically: $$\\int\\limits_0^\\infty\\frac {\\tanh(x)-x\\exp(-x)}{x^2}dx=\\frac{\\zeta'(0)}{\\zeta(0)}-\\frac{\\zeta'(2)}{\\zeta(2)}+\\gamma-\\frac73\\log(2).$$ The method should be similar to the quoted one, i.e. applying the residue theorem to a keyhole contour integral: $$  \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\oint \\frac {\\tanh(z)-z\\exp(-z)}{z^2}\\log(-z) \\, dz.$$ While I guessed correctly that, unlike in the original one, a term with $\\gamma=-\\int\\limits_0^\\infty\\exp(-x)\\log(x)dx$ will survive even in a more elegantly written closed form, I have a hard time understanding how/why the \"regulating part\" $\\dfrac {\\exp(-z)}{z}$ contributes to the sum of residues. Even if it contributed its own residue at $z=0$ (but how can it, as $z=0$ is outside the contour?), I wouldn't see how this residue could lead to $\\gamma$ . Any hints, please?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The way a computation of an integral along an unbounded contour reduces to a sum of residues is often left unjustified, as is done in the linked MO post. In fact this requires an analysis of the behavior of the integrand around $z=\\infty$ ; for $z^{-2}\\tanh^3 z$ , one takes a bounded part of the contour (say, with $|z|<R$ ), makes it closed (say, the boundary of $[-R,R]+i\\pi[-N,N]$ slit along the positive real axis, where $N$ is an integer), and shows that all the \"extra\" things vanish in the limit (as $N,R\\to\\infty$ ). In our case this doesn't work because of the blow-up of $e^{-z}$ as $\\Re z\\to-\\infty$ . Still this can be fixed (see the answer by @Svyatoslav). Another approach (cf.) is as follows. For $a,b\\geqslant 0$ and $0<\\Re s<1$ we have $$\\int_0^\\infty x^{s-2}(e^{-ax}-e^{-bx})\\,dx=\\frac{\\Gamma(s)}{1-s}(b^{1-s}-a^{1-s})$$ (say, use $e^{-ax}-e^{-bx}=x\\int_a^b e^{-xy}\\,dy$ and justify the $dy\\,dx\\mapsto dx\\,dy$ ), then we find $$\\int_0^\\infty x^{s-2}\\tanh x\\,dx=\\frac{\\Gamma(s)}{1-s}\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\big(2(4n+2)^{1-s}-(4n)^{1-s}-(4n+4)^{1-s}\\big)$$ (use $\\tanh x=(1-e^{-2x})^2\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty e^{-4nx}$ and DCT for termwise integration). The sum equals $2^{2-s}(1-2^{2-s})\\zeta(s-1)$ (compute $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty$ for $\\Re s>2$ , and use analytic continuation; the last function of $s$ is entire). Thus we get (still for $0<\\Re s<1$ ) $$\\int_0^\\infty x^{s-2}(\\tanh x-xe^{-x})\\,dx=\\Gamma(s)\\big(f(s)-1\\big),\\\\f(s):=\\frac{2^{2-s}}{1-s}(1-2^{2-s})\\zeta(s-1).$$ It just remains to take $s\\to 0^+$ ; then $f(s)\\to 1$ , hence the limit is $$\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{\\tanh x-xe^{-x}}{x^2}\\,dx=f'(0)=1-12\\zeta'(-1)-\\frac73\\log2.$$ The expression stated in the OP now follows from the relation between $\\zeta'(-1)$ and $\\zeta'(2)$ one obtains from the functional equation for $\\zeta$ , as well as the value of $\\zeta'(0)$ . Note also that $1-12\\zeta'(-1)=12\\log A$ , where $A$ is the Glaisher–Kinkelin constant .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's start by looking at the problem the user provided. They want me to structure the Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format: listing assumptions line by line and then stating the problem. \n\nFirst, the original problem is about proving an integral involving the hyperbolic tangent function, an exponential function, and relating it to derivatives of the Riemann zeta function, Euler-Mascheroni constant, and a logarithm term. The user mentioned using the residue theorem with a keyhole contour integral and is confused about how the regulating part contributes to the residues, especially regarding the gamma term.\n\nNow, I need to extract the assumptions. The example given shows each assumption is a single condition on one object. Let me parse the question for such conditions. \n\nThe integral is from 0 to infinity, so one assumption is the limits of integration. The integrand is (tanh(x) - x exp(-x))/x². The method involves applying the residue theorem to a keyhole contour integral, so another assumption is the use of that specific contour. The function inside the contour integral includes log(-z), which implies a branch cut, probably along the positive real axis, so that's another assumption. The user is also questioning how the exp(-z)/z term contributes, which might relate to considering residues at certain poles, but the problem states z=0 is outside the contour. However, maybe there's an assumption about the behavior of the functions involved in the contour.\n\nWait, the problem statement mentions applying the residue theorem to the keyhole contour integral. So the assumptions would include the choice of contour (keyhole), the functions involved (tanh(z), z exp(-z), log(-z)), and perhaps the exclusion of z=0 from the contour. However, in the example, the assumptions were about the variables and their properties. Here, the problem is more about the method used. So perhaps the assumptions are about the contour, the functions' analyticity except at certain points, and the branch cut for the logarithm.\n\nLet me list possible assumptions:\n\n1. The integral is computed using a keyhole contour.\n2. The contour excludes the origin (z=0).\n3. The function log(-z) has a branch cut along the positive real axis.\n4. The functions tanh(z) and exp(-z) are analytic except at specific poles or essential singularities.\n5. The residue theorem is applicable to the contour integral.\n\nBut the example's assumptions were more about the problem's variables and their conditions. Here, the problem is about the method's conditions. The original example had assumptions on n being an integer and divisible by 7. However, in the current problem, the user is trying to apply a specific method (residue theorem with keyhole contour) and is confused about a part of the integrand's contribution. So the assumptions here would relate to the method's setup.\n\nLooking back, the example's assumptions were about the variable's properties. Here, perhaps the problem's assumptions are related to the contour's properties and the functions' behavior. But the user's task is to structure the problem as per the example. The example extracted conditions on the variable (n is integer, n divisible by 7). In this integral problem, maybe the assumptions are about the functions involved and the contour choice. However, the original problem doesn't state explicit conditions but implies the use of residue theorem with a keyhole contour.\n\nWait, the original problem states: \"applying the residue theorem to a keyhole contour integral: (1/(2πi))∮ [tanh(z)-z exp(-z)]/z² log(-z) dz.\" So the key elements here are the keyhole contour, the integrand's form, and the functions involved.\n\nPossible assumptions:\n\n- The integral is evaluated using a keyhole contour.\n- The function log(-z) introduces a branch cut along the positive real axis.\n- The integrand [tanh(z) - z exp(-z)]/z² is meromorphic inside the contour except at poles/branch cuts.\n- The contour excludes z=0 (since the user mentions z=0 is outside).\n\nBut in the example, each assumption was a separate line, each addressing one property. So translating this into assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated using a keyhole contour,\nThe function log(-z) has a branch cut along the positive real axis,\nThe integrand [tanh(z) - z exp(-z)]/z² is considered in the complex plane,\nThe contour excludes the point z=0,\nResidues are calculated at poles inside the contour.\n\nBut maybe some of these are part of the method, not assumptions. The problem is to prove the integral equals that expression involving zeta derivatives, gamma, and log(2). The assumptions would be the conditions under which this equality holds. But the user is asking about the method's steps, so perhaps the problem's assumptions are the setup for applying the residue theorem.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might not have explicit assumptions beyond the integral's form and the method used, but the example included even if the original problem didn't state them. For instance, in the example, the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7, but the formatted version included it. Wait, no, looking back, the example's original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, the original example's original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Wait, the original example's formatted problem might have been a different problem. Maybe the user provided an example where the original problem had a hidden assumption. Wait, perhaps the example is different. Let me check.\n\nThe example's original problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. Formatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove A(n) is divisible by 91. But that seems conflicting. If n is any integer, but the assumption adds n divisible by 7, which would restrict it. Wait, perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user might have intended that. So maybe in their formatting, they extract assumptions from the problem, even if they are not explicitly stated. But in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which is an assumption. But the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\", which was not in the original. That might be an error, but perhaps the user made a typo. Alternatively, maybe the example is correct, and the original problem had a mistake. Regardless, the user wants to structure the given problem into Assumptions and Problem.\n\nSo for the current problem, the original question is about proving the integral equals that combination of zeta derivatives, gamma, and log(2). The user tried using a keyhole contour integral with log(-z) and is confused about the exp(-z)/z term's contribution. The problem involves applying the residue theorem, so the assumptions would relate to the contour, the functions' analyticity, and the residues involved.\n\nHowever, in the example, assumptions were about the variable in the problem (n being integer, n divisible by 7). In the current problem, the integral's variable is x, but the method involves complex analysis. The problem's assumptions might include the path of integration (keyhole contour), analytic properties of the integrand, etc.\n\nBut perhaps the user's intended format is to list the mathematical assumptions necessary to apply the method. But since the original problem is a proof, the assumptions could be the conditions under which the integral equals the given expression. However, in the example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the assumptions included n being an integer and divisible by 7. That seems like the problem's original statement was for every integer n, but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be incorrect, but following the user's example, perhaps the task is to list any conditions on the variables or functions used in the problem, even if they're implicit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's example had a mistake, but we need to follow it as is. In the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", and the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. Then the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. But in reality, if n is any integer, the expression might not be divisible by 91 unless there's a condition like n being divisible by 7. So perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user wants the same approach.\n\nApplying this to the current problem: The integral is from 0 to infinity. The functions involved are tanh(x), x exp(-x), and the denominator x². The problem is to prove the integral equals a certain expression. The method uses a keyhole contour and residues. The assumptions would then be the conditions required for the residue theorem to apply: the contour is a keyhole contour avoiding z=0, the integrand is meromorphic except at certain points, etc. But how to list them as single-line assumptions?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's assumptions are the steps taken in the method, but the user wants to extract them. But in the example, the assumptions were about the variable's properties. Here, maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated using the residue theorem,\nThe keyhole contour excludes the origin,\nThe function log(-z) has a branch cut along the positive real axis,\nThe integrand [tanh(z) - z exp(-z)]/z² is analytic except at poles inside the contour,\nThe residues contribute to the integral's value.\n\nBut each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is computed using a keyhole contour,\nThe contour excludes the point z=0,\nThe function log(-z) has a branch cut on the positive real axis,\nThe integrand [tanh(z) - z exp(-z)]/z² is meromorphic in the complex plane,\nThe residue theorem is applicable to the contour integral.\n\nBut the original problem's question is about how the exp(-z)/z term contributes, particularly regarding the gamma constant. The user is confused because even if exp(-z)/z had a residue at z=0, which is outside the contour, it shouldn't contribute. So maybe an assumption missing here is that the integral is split into parts, and the regulating term (exp(-z)/z) allows some cancellation or contribution via another method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions are more about the functions' behavior, like tanh(z) having poles at z = iπ/2 + iπk for integers k, which would be inside the keyhole contour if the contour is large enough. But the user is focusing on the exp(-z)/z term's contribution.\n\nI think the key assumptions here are:\n\n- The use of a keyhole contour integral for evaluation.\n- The branch cut of log(-z) is on the positive real axis.\n- The integrand is considered in the complex plane with the specified contour.\n- The residues are calculated at the poles of tanh(z) and possibly other singularities.\n\nBut following the example's structure, each assumption is a simple statement. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated using a keyhole contour,\nThe function log(-z) has a branch cut along the positive real axis,\nThe integrand includes the term [tanh(z) - z exp(-z)]/z²,\nThe contour excludes the origin z=0,\nResidues are computed at poles enclosed by the contour.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$\\int_0^\\infty\\frac {\\tanh(x)-x\\exp(-x)}{x^2}dx=\\frac{\\zeta'(0)}{\\zeta(0)}-\\frac{\\zeta'(2)}{\\zeta(2)}+\\gamma-\\frac73\\log(2).$$\n\nBut wait, the original problem's integral is from 0 to infinity, so maybe an assumption is that x is real and positive. But in the example, the variable's conditions (n integer) were listed. Here, x is integrated over the positive real line, so perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real positive variable,\nThe integral is computed using contour integration in the complex plane,\nThe keyhole contour encircles the positive real axis,\nThe function log(-z) is analytically continued with a branch cut on the positive real axis,\nThe integrand [tanh(z) - z exp(-z)]/z² is meromorphic except at poles and branch cuts.\n\nBut this might be overcomplicating. The example had two assumptions for the variable n. Here, the integral problem's assumptions might be more about the method's setup than the variable's properties. However, following the example's pattern, even if the original problem states \"for every integer n\", the formatted version added an extra assumption \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like an error, but perhaps the user intended to show that assumptions can be extracted even if not explicitly stated. So maybe in this case, the assumptions are:\n\n- The integral is transformed into a contour integral using a keyhole contour.\n- The branch cut of log(-z) is placed on the positive real axis.\n- The residues at the poles of tanh(z) contribute to the integral.\n- The regulating term z exp(-z)/z² is handled separately.\n\nBut each assumption should be a single line. Maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated using the residue theorem with a keyhole contour,\nThe function log(-z) has a branch cut along the positive real axis,\nThe integrand has poles at the zeros of cosh(z),\nThe regulating term z exp(-z) contributes to the residue calculation,\nThe origin z=0 is excluded from the contour.\n\nBut I'm not sure. The key is to extract each assumption as a single line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Given the example, even if the original problem didn't state the assumptions, the formatted version lists them. So here, the problem is about proving the integral equals that expression, and the method uses a keyhole contour with log(-z). The assumptions would be the necessary conditions for that method to work. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is computed via contour integration using a keyhole contour,\nThe branch cut of log(-z) is placed on the positive real axis,\nThe integrand is analytic except at poles inside the contour,\nThe residues at the poles of tanh(z) are included in the calculation,\nThe regulating term z exp(-z)/z² contributes to the residue sum.\n\nBut maybe each line should be more precise. For example, instead of \"the integrand is analytic except...\", perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\ntanh(z) has simple poles at z = iπ/2 + iπk for integers k,\nThe keyhole contour encloses the poles of tanh(z),\nThe function log(-z) is analytic with a branch cut on the positive real axis,\nThe integral over the keyhole contour relates to the original real integral,\nThe residue theorem applies to the contour integral.\n\nBut again, I'm not sure. The user's example had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, the problem's assumptions would be the method's conditions, but each as a single line.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem's assumptions are the properties of the integrand and contour:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is transformed to a keyhole contour integral in the complex plane,\nThe function log(-z) introduces a branch cut along the positive real axis,\nThe integrand [tanh(z) - z exp(-z)]/z² has poles at z = iπ/2 + iπk for integers k,\nThe contour excludes the origin z=0,\nThe residue theorem is applied to compute the integral.\n\nProblem: Prove the stated equality involving the integral and the mathematical constants.\n\nI think this is close. Each assumption is a single condition on one object. Now, writing this in the required format.",
