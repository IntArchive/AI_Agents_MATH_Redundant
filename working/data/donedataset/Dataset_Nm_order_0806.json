    "Content": "Let $x_1,...,x_n$ be distinct integers. Prove that $$\\prod_{i<j} \\frac{x_i-x_j}{i-j}\\in \\mathbb Z$$ I know there is a solution using determinant of a matrix, but I can't remember it now. Any help will be appreciated.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If $x_1$, $\\ldots$, $x_n$ are integers, then $\\prod_{1\\le i<j\\le n} \\frac{x_i-x_j}{i-j}$ is integral because it is the determinant of the integral matrix\n$$\\left(x_i \\choose j-1\\right)_{i,j=1,\\ldots,n}.$$ You can see this by starting with the formula for the determinant of the Vandermonde matrix, $$\\det\\left( (x_i^{j-1})_{i,j=1,\\ldots,n}\\right) = \\prod_{1\\le i<j\\le n} (x_j-x_i);$$ then, divide column $j$ of the Vandermonde matrix by $(j-1)!$ to get the matrix\n$$\\left(\\frac{x_i^{j-1}}{(j-1)!}\\right)_{i,j=1,\\ldots,n}$$\ngiven by Eric Naslund above.  Its determinant equals $\\prod_{1\\le i<j\\le n} \\frac{x_j-x_i}{j-i}=\\prod_{1\\le i<j\\le n} \\frac{x_i-x_j}{i-j}$.  Finally, taking $j=n$, $n-1$, $\\ldots$, $1$ in succession, add in rational multiples of columns $1$, $\\ldots$, $j-1$ to column $j$ to change each $\\frac{x_i^{j-1}}{(j-1)!}$ to $x_i \\choose j-1$; this does not change the determinant of the matrix.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example provided helps, so I need to follow that.\n\nFirst, the original problem from Math Stack Exchange is about proving that the product product_{i<j} (x_i - x_j)/(i - j) is an integer, given that x_1, ..., x_n are distinct integers. The user mentioned a solution involving determinants but can't recall it. They need the problem formatted with assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe example given had assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. In the example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So here, I need to identify the assumptions in the current problem.\n\nLooking at the problem: \"Let x_1,...,x_n be distinct integers.\" So the first assumption is that each x_i is an integer. But also, they are distinct. So maybe split that into two assumptions: x_1, ..., x_n are integers, and they are distinct. Wait, but in the example, they combined \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate lines. Similarly, here, the problem states that the x_i's are distinct integers. So perhaps split into two: each x_i is an integer, and all x_i are distinct from each other. Wait, but \"distinct\" is a property of the set, not individual x_i. Hmm. The original problem states \"distinct integers\", so maybe one assumption is that x_1, ..., x_n are distinct integers. But according to the example, each assumption should address only one property. So maybe split into two: each x_i is an integer, and for all i ≠ j, x_i ≠ x_j. But maybe the user prefers each assumption on one line, even if it's a combined condition. Wait, in the example, the problem had \"for every integer n\", so the first assumption was \"n is an integer\". Then the second assumption was \"n is divisible by 7\". But in the original problem, the user had written \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem split into \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, no, looking back, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem included an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that example seems incorrect. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be a mistake. Wait, in the original problem, the user wrote \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, the assumptions include \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems conflicting. Maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so n is any integer, but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. So that example might be incorrect. Therefore, maybe in the current problem, we need to be careful to only list the assumptions given in the problem, not introduce new ones. \n\nSo the problem here is: Let x_1,...,x_n be distinct integers. Prove that the product of (x_i - x_j)/(i - j) over all i < j is an integer. So the assumptions should be that x_1, ..., x_n are integers, and that they are distinct. So each of those as separate assumptions. But according to the example, each assumption should be one line, addressing one property. So the first assumption is \"x_1, x_2, ..., x_n are integers\". The second assumption is \"x_i ≠ x_j for all i ≠ j\". So that's two assumptions. Then the problem is to prove the product is an integer. \n\nWait, but in the example, the user wrote \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as two separate assumptions, even though the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7. So maybe that example was incorrect. But since we have to follow the user's example, perhaps even if the original problem didn't state some conditions, the formatted problem includes assumptions. Wait, but in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems like an error. Unless the user made a mistake. Hmm, perhaps the user's example was wrong, but we have to follow the structure regardless. But in the current problem, the original question doesn't have any additional conditions beyond x_i being distinct integers. So the assumptions should be x_i are integers, and they are distinct. So two assumptions. Then the problem is to prove the product is an integer.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nx_1, x_2, ..., x_n are integers,\nx_i ≠ x_j for all i ≠ j.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\prod_{i<j} \\frac{x_i - x_j}{i - j}$$ is an integer.\n\nBut let me check the original problem again. The user's example extracted the assumptions from the problem. In the original problem here, the problem states \"Let x_1,...,x_n be distinct integers.\" So the two assumptions here are that each x_i is an integer and that they are distinct. So that's two separate assumptions. So in the Assumption section, each on its own line. Then the problem is as stated.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the formatted problem should have those two assumptions, and then the problem statement. So I think that's how it should be structured.",
