    "Content": "Question What are the words to describe the method in the image below? (from Nelsen's Proofs without Words II ) Attempt I was thinking and could define the sequence $u_1=2; u_{n+1}=f\\circ g^{−1}(u_n)$ where $f(x)=\\sqrt x$ and $g(x)=x−2$ , as suggested by image, and thus, by the graph, it suggests that the succession defined in this way, is increasing and that $u_n<2$ , therefore increased, which was concluded to be convergent. Once it converges, let $l\\in\\mathbb R$ be its limit. As $\\lim u_n=\\lim u_{n+1}$ , since for the limit we are only interested in terms starting from a certain order, and that $f\\circ g^{−1}$ is a continuous function, a composition of continuous functions is continuous, in the respective domains, we can conclude $\\lim u_{n+1}=\\lim f(g^{−1}(u_n))\\iff l=\\sqrt{l+2}$ and thus $l=−1$ or $l=2$ , but $−1$ does not belong to the domain of the function. What do you think ? Am I complicating? I believe there will be an easier way out, although that's the idea. Thanks in advance.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The image is showing two (convergent) fixed-point iterations: $$f: x\\mapsto \\sqrt{2+x}\\quad\\text{with the starting value of }x=0\\tag 1$$ and $$g: x\\mapsto 2+\\sqrt{x}\\quad\\text{with the starting value of }x=2\\tag 2$$ However, in contrast to usual depictions of fixed-point iterations over $\\Bbb R$ , the picture has some extra obfucsations , which are particularly bad in the advertiset \"no words, one image will do the trick\" context. Hence, prior to discussing the iteration(s), let's point out these obfuscations. Usually, such depictions of fixed-point iterations have 3 identifying features: The graph of a function $f(x)$ that's being iterated, for $x$ -values that are near the fixed-point(s) of interest. The line $x=y$ which maps $y$ -values back to $x$ -values. This is the realization of the iteration of $x\\mapsto f(x)$ .  The line $x=y$ intersects the graph of $f$ at the fixed-point(s) of $f$ . A zig-zag line between these two graphs: Vertical portions implement the mapping $x\\mapsto f(x)$ , and horizontal portions that take the resulting $y$ -values and \"transform\" them to $x$ -values, which can be fed back into $f$ again. Here is an animation from Wikimedia that's showing the Verhulst process for some parameter (It has an attractive fixed-point around $x=0.6$ and a repelling one at $x=0$ ): Obfucsations The author chose to decompose $f$ and $g$ into a square-root-part $q(x)=\\sqrt{x}$ and an adding-2-part $t(x)=2+x$ : $$f=q\\circ t\\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad g=t\\circ q$$ In order to map $y$ -values back to $x$ -values, they do not use $y\\mapsto x$ but the function $t$ which must be used in reverse , namely the contorted $x+2\\mapsto x$ which means $x\\mapsto x-2$ . The coordinate dimensions are not 1:1. A fixed-point iteration will converge for a smooth $f$ , if I. the function is a contraction over some interval, i.e. $f([a,b]) \\subseteq [a,b]$ and II. $|f'(x)|<1$ for $x\\in [a,b]$ .  This means that by visual inspection one can discriminate between attracting fixed-points (flat $|f'(x)|<1$ around the fixed-point) and repelling ones (steep $|f'(x)|>1$ ).  Visual inspection is hampered by the distorted aspect ratio, however. Analysis As the book mentions $\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2+\\cdots}}}=2$ , I'll restrict myself to iteration $(1)$ .  As mentioned above, the iteration generates a sequence of values $x_n$ that satisfy $$x_{n+1} = f(x_n) = \\sqrt{2+x_n}\\quad\\text{with } x_0 = 0 \\tag 1$$ We already unravelled the very iteration, and I see no reason to include the contrived use of $x+2\\mapsto x$ into the analysis. A necessary condition for convergence is that $f$ has a fixed point, i.e. if $X=\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} x_n$ exists, then we must have $X=f(X)$ which means $X=\\sqrt{X+2}$ , thus $X^2=X+2$ and $X\\geqslant 0$ .  The only solution is $X=2$ . Also notice that $f$ is continuous, and as it's even differentiable, we can estimate $x_n-X$ as follows: $$x_{n-1}-X = f(x_n) - f(X) \\stackrel{(3)} = (x_n-X)f'(\\xi)\\quad\\text{ with } \\xi\\in I(x_n,X)$$ where $I(x_n,X)$ denotes the interval limited by $x_n$ and $X$ , and $(3)$ holds due to the mean value theorem . Now $f$ is increasing and concave , hence we have $x_n \\geqslant x_0$ for all $x_n$ and thus $$|x_{n+1}-X| = |x_n-X|\\cdot|f'(\\xi)| \\leqslant |x_n-X|\\cdot\\underbrace{|f'(x_0)|}_{\\textstyle =1/\\sqrt 8}$$ and by induction: $$|x_n-X| \\leqslant |x_0-X|\\frac1{8^{n/2}}$$ This means that $x_n\\to X$ because $|1/\\sqrt 8| < 1$ . Notice that this reasoning is pretty general. The only property we used from $X$ is that it is a fixed-point of $f$ .  And from $f$ we only used that it's smooth, and we managed to estimate $|f'(x) < 1|$ for all $x$ in question.  And that is what the picture conveys: $f$ is flat and has a fixed-point, thus the fixed-point is attractive and the iteration will approach it.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So the user wants me to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example given had an assumption section listing each condition line by line, and then the problem statement.\n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The title is about proving that an infinite nested square root expression equals 2. The user mentioned a sequence defined by u₁=2 and u_{n+1} = f∘g⁻¹(u_n), where f(x) = √x and g(x) = x - 2. They also talk about the sequence being increasing and bounded above by 2, hence convergent. Then they set the limit l and solve l = √(l + 2), leading to l=2.\n\nWait, but in the example provided, the assumptions were things like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". In this current problem, the assumptions would be about the sequence definition. Let me parse the original question again.\n\nThe user defines u₁ = 2, and each subsequent term is u_{n+1} = f(g⁻¹(u_n)), where f is sqrt(x) and g is x - 2. So g⁻¹(x) would be x + 2, right? Because if g(x) = x - 2, then to invert it, we solve y = x - 2, so x = y + 2. Therefore, g⁻¹(x) = x + 2. Therefore, f(g⁻¹(u_n)) would be sqrt(u_n + 2). So the recurrence relation is u_{n+1} = sqrt(u_n + 2). \n\nWait, the original problem's title is about sqrt(2 + sqrt(2 + sqrt(2 + ...))) which is known to converge to 2. So this sequence u_n is defined as starting at 2, then each term is sqrt(previous term + 2). But the user's description says u₁=2, and u_{n+1} = sqrt(u_n + 2). The problem is to show that this converges to 2.\n\nIn their attempt, they note that the sequence is increasing and bounded above by 2, hence convergent. Then they set the limit l = sqrt(l + 2), leading to l=2. But they also mention that the image from Nelsen's book suggests this method.\n\nSo for structuring this into the Assumption and Problem sections. The original problem's core is proving that the infinite nested radical equals 2. The assumptions here would be the initial condition and the recursive definition. Let's see:\n\nAssumptions from the problem:\n- u₁ = 2 (the initial term of the sequence)\n- For each n ≥ 1, u_{n+1} = sqrt(u_n + 2) (the recursive relation)\n- The sequence u_n is increasing (as per the user's attempt, which they derived from the image)\n- The sequence u_n is bounded above by 2 (also from the user's analysis)\n\nBut wait, the example given in the instructions for the previous problem had each assumption as a single line, each applying to one object. For instance, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So here, perhaps the assumptions are the definitions and properties given in the problem. The problem statement is to prove that the infinite nested radical equals 2. However, the user's approach defines a sequence and uses its convergence. So maybe the problem as structured here is to prove that the limit of the sequence is 2, given those assumptions.\n\nWait, the original problem's title is \"A Proof with no words that sqrt{2+sqrt{2+sqrt{2+...}}}=2\", so the problem is to prove that the infinite nested radical equals 2. The user then describes their approach using the sequence. So perhaps the assumptions are the definition of the sequence, and the problem is to show the limit is 2.\n\nBut in the example, the problem was restated as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" with assumptions about n. Here, the problem would be \"Prove that sqrt{2+sqrt{2+sqrt{2+...}}}=2\" with assumptions being the sequence definition. However, the user's own approach includes that the sequence is increasing and bounded above by 2, but perhaps those are part of the solution, not the problem's assumptions.\n\nWait, the user's question is about whether their method is correct. But the task here is to structure the problem as per the given format, filtering unrelated information. So the original problem is to prove that the infinite nested radical equals 2. The user's approach defines the sequence u_n with u₁=2 and u_{n+1}=sqrt(u_n +2). Then they assume the sequence is increasing and bounded above by 2, hence convergent. Then they find the limit by solving l=sqrt(l +2).\n\nBut for structuring the problem, the assumptions would be the initial conditions and recursive definitions given in the problem. The problem is to prove the limit is 2. Wait, but the original problem's title is the statement to prove. So perhaps the problem is as in the title, and the assumptions would be the definition of the sequence as per the image (u₁=2, u_{n+1}=sqrt(u_n + 2)), and perhaps that the sequence is increasing and bounded above by 2, but maybe those are part of the solution steps, not the problem's assumptions.\n\nWait, the user's question is their own attempt, but the task is to structure the problem from the original post. The original problem is to prove that the infinite radical equals 2. The user is proposing a method using a sequence. So to structure the problem, we need to capture the problem as presented, not the user's attempt. The title is the problem: \"Prove that sqrt{2 + sqrt{2 + sqrt{2 + ...}} = 2\". The user's question then describes their approach using the sequence. But perhaps the assumptions would be the definition of the sequence and its properties as given in the image (from Nelsen's book). The image suggests defining the sequence with u₁=2 and u_{n+1} = sqrt(u_n + 2). The problem is to prove that the limit is 2. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- The sequence is defined by u₁ = 2.\n- For each n ≥ 1, u_{n+1} = sqrt(u_n + 2).\n- The sequence is increasing.\n- The sequence is bounded above by 2.\n\nBut in the example given, the assumptions were about the conditions on n. Here, the problem's assumptions would be the initial term and the recursive formula. The properties of being increasing and bounded might be part of the problem's requirements or part of the proof. However, since the user's attempt mentions these properties, perhaps they are part of the problem's given conditions? Wait, the image in Nelsen's Proofs without Words might visually suggest that the sequence is increasing and bounded, so perhaps the problem assumes that the reader knows the sequence is convergent. Alternatively, maybe the problem is presented as \"Prove that the infinite radical equals 2\" using the sequence approach, with the assumptions being the recursive definition. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem as presented in the image is to show that the limit of the sequence defined by u₁=2 and u_{n+1}=sqrt(u_n + 2) is 2. Therefore, the problem would be to prove that the limit is 2, with assumptions being the sequence definition. The properties of being increasing and bounded might be part of the proof steps, not the problem's assumptions. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- u₁ = 2\n- For each integer n ≥ 1, u_{n+1} = sqrt(u_n + 2)\n\nAnd the problem is to prove that the limit of u_n as n approaches infinity is 2.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is to prove the equality of the infinite radical, then the assumptions might be the recursive definition of the terms. But the infinite radical is equivalent to the limit of the sequence defined by a₁ = sqrt(2), a_{n+1} = sqrt(2 + a_n}. However, in the user's case, the sequence starts at 2, which is different. Wait, the user's sequence starts at u₁=2, then u₂= sqrt(2 + 2) = sqrt(4)=2. Then u₃= sqrt(2 + 2)=2. Wait, that would make the sequence constant at 2. That can't be right. Wait, perhaps there's a mistake here.\n\nWait, wait. Let me check. If u₁ = 2, then u₂ = sqrt(u₁ + 2) = sqrt(2 + 2) = sqrt(4) = 2. Then u₃ = sqrt(2 + 2) = 2, and so on. So the sequence is constant at 2. That's trivial. But that's not the usual definition for the infinite nested radical. The standard one starts at a₁ = sqrt(2), then a₂ = sqrt(2 + sqrt(2)), etc. So perhaps the user made a mistake in their sequence definition. Alternatively, maybe the image in the book uses a different starting point. Wait, the problem's title is about sqrt(2 + sqrt(2 + ...)), which usually starts with a term inside, but if you start with u₁=2, then all terms are 2. That seems off. Maybe the user's initial term is wrong. Let me check the original question again.\n\nThe user wrote: \"the succession defined in this way, is increasing and that u_n < 2, therefore increased, which was concluded to be convergent.\" Wait, if u_n < 2 and the sequence is increasing, then the limit would be 2. But if u₁=2, then u₂=sqrt(2 + 2)=2, so all terms are 2. Then the sequence is constant, not increasing. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in their initial term. Alternatively, maybe the image in the book starts with u₁=0 or some other value. Wait, perhaps the user's description is incorrect. Let me re-examine the original problem.\n\nOriginal question says: \"the image below (from Nelsen's Proofs without Words II) suggests that the succession defined in this way is increasing and that u_n < 2, therefore increased, which was concluded to be convergent.\" So the image must show a sequence that starts below 2 and increases towards 2. Therefore, perhaps the correct initial term is less than 2, like u₁=0 or u₁=sqrt(2). But the user says they defined u₁=2. That seems contradictory. Therefore, the user might have an error in their setup. However, as the assistant, I need to structure the problem as per the user's description, even if there's a mistake. But perhaps the user meant a different starting value. Alternatively, maybe the sequence is defined differently.\n\nWait, the problem's title is about the infinite radical sqrt(2 + sqrt(2 + ...)), which typically starts with a₁ = sqrt(2), then a₂ = sqrt(2 + sqrt(2)), etc. So the limit would be 2. However, the user's sequence starts at u₁=2, which would make all terms 2. That suggests the user may have misdefined the sequence. But according to their description, the image defines u_{n+1} = f(g⁻¹(u_n)) where f(x)=sqrt(x) and g(x)=x - 2. So g⁻¹(x) is x + 2, hence u_{n+1} = sqrt(u_n + 2). If u₁=2, then u₂=sqrt(2 + 2)=2, so all terms are 2. But the user says the sequence is increasing and u_n < 2. That doesn't add up. Therefore, there's a mistake in the user's setup. Perhaps the initial term should be u₁=0, then u₂=sqrt(0 + 2)=sqrt(2), u₃=sqrt(2 + sqrt(2)), etc., which would approach 2. Alternatively, maybe the functions f and g are different. Wait, the user defines f(x)=sqrt(x) and g(x)=x−2. Then g⁻¹(x) is x + 2, so f(g⁻¹(u_n)) is sqrt(u_n + 2). So if the sequence is u_{n+1}=sqrt(u_n + 2), then to get the standard nested radical starting at sqrt(2), the initial term should be u₁=0: u₁=0, u₂=sqrt(0 + 2)=sqrt(2), u₃=sqrt(2 + sqrt(2)), etc. But the user says u₁=2. That seems incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in their initial term, leading to a constant sequence. However, as per the instructions, I need to structure the problem as presented, even if there's an error. Alternatively, maybe the image in the book uses a different function composition. Let me try to think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the functions f and g are different. If the image is a proof without words, maybe it's using a geometric interpretation. Suppose we have a diagram where each step adds 2 and takes square root, starting from some initial value. If the user interpreted the starting value as 2, but actually the image starts from 0 or another value. But without seeing the image, it's hard to tell. However, the user explicitly states u₁=2. Given that, the sequence would be constant, but the user claims it's increasing and bounded above by 2. That's a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the user's question. However, as the assistant tasked with structuring their problem, I should proceed with the information given, even if there's an inconsistency.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions based on the user's description would be:\n\n- u₁ = 2\n- For each n ≥ 1, u_{n+1} = sqrt(u_n + 2)\n- The sequence u_n is increasing\n- The sequence u_n is bounded above by 2\n\nProblem: Prove that the limit of the sequence u_n is 2.\n\nBut the user's own calculation shows that if the limit l exists, then l = sqrt(l + 2), leading to l=2. But with u₁=2, the sequence is constant, so the limit is trivially 2. But the user talks about the sequence being increasing and bounded, which doesn't apply if it's constant. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. Perhaps the user intended u₁ to be less than 2, like 0 or sqrt(2). But since the user explicitly wrote u₁=2, I have to go with that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a typo, and the initial term is different. But without more information, I can't assume that. Therefore, based on the user's description, the assumptions are:\n\n- u₁ = 2\n- For each n ≥ 1, u_{n+1} = sqrt(u_n + 2)\n- The sequence u_n is increasing\n- The sequence u_n is bounded above by 2\n\nProblem: Prove that the limit of the sequence u_n is 2.\n\nBut this setup is flawed because starting at 2 makes the sequence constant. However, if the user insists on these assumptions, then the problem would be trivial. Therefore, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the user's part. Alternatively, maybe the image in the book uses a different definition. But given the information, I'll proceed.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be to consider the infinite radical expression sqrt(2 + sqrt(2 + ...)) and show it equals 2, which is the title. The sequence approach usually starts with a₁ = sqrt(2), but the user's approach starts at 2. That seems off. But perhaps the problem is as in the title, and the user's attempt is their own way, which might have a mistake.\n\nIn that case, the problem as per the title is: Prove that sqrt{2 + sqrt{2 + sqrt{2 + ...}}} = 2. The assumptions for this would be the standard sequence definition for the nested radical, which is:\n\n- a₁ = sqrt(2)\n- For each n ≥ 1, a_{n+1} = sqrt(2 + a_n)\n\nBut the user's sequence starts at 2, so perhaps the problem is different. Given the confusion, I'll have to make a judgment call. Since the title is about the infinite radical, which usually starts with the first term as sqrt(2), but the user's sequence starts at 2, there's a discrepancy. However, the user's problem might be as per their description, so the assumptions would be as they defined.\n\nBut given that the example provided in the instructions had assumptions that were part of the problem statement (like n being an integer), here the assumptions would be the initial term and the recurrence relation. The problem is to find the limit. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- The sequence u_n is defined by u₁ = 2,\n- For each integer n ≥ 1, u_{n+1} = sqrt(u_n + 2).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the limit of the sequence u_n as n approaches infinity is 2.\n\nBut this would be trivial because all terms are 2. Alternatively, if the initial term was different, like u₁=0, then the problem makes sense. However, based on the user's explicit statement, u₁=2. Therefore, perhaps the user intended a different initial term. But without further information, I have to proceed with what's given.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be as in the title, to prove the infinite radical equals 2, which is a standard problem. In that case, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The sequence a_n is defined by a₁ = sqrt(2),\n- For each n ≥ 1, a_{n+1} = sqrt(2 + a_n).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the limit of the sequence a_n as n approaches infinity is 2.\n\nBut the user's own sequence starts at 2. So there's a conflict. Given that the user's title is about the infinite radical, but their sequence definition is different, perhaps there's a mistake in their setup. However, the task is to structure the problem as per the user's question, so I'll include their assumptions.\n\nIn conclusion, the user's problem as described has:\n\nAssumptions:\n- u₁ = 2,\n- For each n ≥ 1, u_{n+1} = sqrt(u_n + 2),\n- The sequence u_n is increasing,\n- The sequence u_n is bounded above by 2.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the limit of the sequence u_n is 2.\n\nBut since the sequence is constant at 2, the problem is trivial. However, the user's mistake might be in the initial term. Given that the example provided in the instructions included assumptions that were part of the problem (like n being an integer and divisible by 7), here the relevant assumptions would be the initial term and the recurrence relation. The properties of being increasing and bounded are part of the solution, not the problem's assumptions. Therefore, perhaps the correct assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\n- The sequence u_n is defined by u₁ = 2,\n- For each integer n ≥ 1, u_{n+1} = sqrt(u_n + 2).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the limit of the sequence u_n as n approaches infinity is 2.\n\nBut as noted, this is trivial. Therefore, the user likely intended a different initial term. However, since the user explicitly wrote u₁=2, I must follow that. Perhaps the image in the book uses a different starting point, but without seeing it, I can't confirm. Therefore, the structured problem based on the user's description is as follows.",
