    "Content": "If $$\n0 \\to A \\to B\\to C,$$ is a left exact sequence of $R$ -module, then for any $R$ -module $M$ , $$\n0 \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_R(M,A)\\to \\operatorname{Hom}_R(M,B)\\to \\operatorname{Hom}_R(M,C),\n$$ is left exact. I proved the above, and highlighted what I'm a little unfamiliar with: Let $$\n0 \\to A\\ \\xrightarrow{i}\\ B\\ \\xrightarrow{f}\\ C,\n$$ and $$\n0 \\to \\operatorname{Hom}(M,A)\\ \\xrightarrow{\\operatorname{Hom}(M,i)}\\ \\operatorname{Hom}(M,B)\\ \\xrightarrow{\\operatorname{Hom}(M,f)}\\ \\operatorname{Hom}(M,C).\n$$ We need to show that $$\n\\ker\\left(\\operatorname{Hom}(M,f)\\right)=\\operatorname{Hom}(M,i)(\\operatorname{Hom}(M,A)).\n$$ Let $i \\circ \\varphi \\in \\operatorname{RHS}$ . Then $f \\circ i \\circ \\varphi : M \\to C$ is $0$ since $f \\circ i \\circ \\varphi(M) \\subseteq f( i(A)) = f(\\ker(f))=0$ . Conversely, let $\\psi \\in \\operatorname{LHS}$ . Then $f \\circ \\psi = 0$ so that $ f(\\psi(M))=0$ . Hence $\\psi(M) \\subseteq \\ker(f)=i(A)$ . Since the image of $\\psi$ is contained in the image of $i$ , we may factor $\\psi$ as $\\psi=i \\varphi$ with $\\varphi : M \\to A$ . (Here is my trial, but I'm not fully understanding this: Since $i$ is injective, $i(A)$ is isomorphic with $A$ . So $i^{-1}(\\psi (M)) \\subseteq A$ and if we let $\\varphi=i^{-1} \\psi$ , then $\\psi = i \\varphi$ .) And I have one more question: The above looks very messy, especially the notation. Is there a better proof/understanding about it?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Well, your proof is okay. Let me suggest a slightly different way of looking at it: Consider a sequence $$ 0\\; \\xrightarrow{\\phantom{ij}} \\; A \\; \\xrightarrow{i\\phantom{j}}\\; B\\; \\xrightarrow{j\\phantom{i}} \\; C$$\nand look at\n$$ 0\\; \\xrightarrow{\\phantom{j_{\\ast}}}\n\\operatorname{Hom}{(M,A)}\\; \\xrightarrow{i_{\\ast}}\\operatorname{Hom}{(M,B)} \\;\\xrightarrow{j_{\\ast}}\\;\n\\operatorname{Hom}{(M,C)},$$\nwhere I write $i_{\\ast} = \\operatorname{Hom}(M,i)$ and $j_{\\ast} =  \\operatorname{Hom}(M,j)$. Saying that the first sequence is exact amounts to saying $i = \\ker{j}$, that is $ji = 0$ and $i$ has the universal property as depicted in the first diagram below: If $g: M \\to B$ is such that $jg = 0$ then there exists a unique $f: M \\to A$ such that $if = g$. In other words if $j_\\ast g = 0$ then $g = i_{\\ast}f$, or yet again $\\operatorname{Ker}{j_\\ast} \\subset \\operatorname{Im}{i_{\\ast}}$ and $i_{\\ast}$ is injective. On the other hand, the second diagram says: if $g: M \\to B$ is of the form $g = if = i_{\\ast}f$ then $j_{\\ast}g = 0$ (because $j_\\ast g = j_{\\ast}i_{\\ast} f = (ji)_{\\ast}f = 0f = 0$). In other words, $\\operatorname{Im}{i_{\\ast}} \\subset \\operatorname{Ker}{j_{\\ast}}$. Summing up, we have shown that for all $M$ the sequence $$ 0\\; \\xrightarrow{\\phantom{j_{\\ast}}}\n\\operatorname{Hom}{(M,A)}\\; \\xrightarrow{i_{\\ast}}\\operatorname{Hom}{(M,B)} \\;\\xrightarrow{j_{\\ast}}\\;\n\\operatorname{Hom}{(M,C)}$$\nis exact both at $\\operatorname{Hom}{(M,A)}$ ($i_{\\ast}$ is injective) and at $\\operatorname{Hom}{(M,B)}$ ($\\operatorname{Im}{i_{\\ast}} = \\operatorname{Ker}{j_{\\ast}}$)—you seem to have forgotten about the first point here. Added: As witnessed by the argument above, left exactness of $\\operatorname{Hom}$ is essentially the definition of left exactness in the abelian category of $R$-modules. As the comments try to point out, the importance of this fact cannot be overemphasized. I would like to add two further points: A functor $F$ is left exact in your definition if and only if $0 \\to F(A) \\to F(B) \\to F(C)$ is left exact for every short exact sequence $0 \\to A \\to B \\to C \\to 0$. Indeed, in a left exact sequence $0 \\to A \\to B \\to C$, we may factor $j: B \\to C$ over its image as $B \\twoheadrightarrow \\operatorname{Im}{j} \\rightarrowtail C$ and obtain two exact sequences $$0 \\to A \\to B \\to \\operatorname{Im}{j} \\to 0 \\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad 0 \\to \\operatorname{Im}{j} \\to C \\to \\operatorname{Coker}{j} \\to 0.$$ Applying $F$ to these two exact sequences, we obtain the left exact sequences $$0 \\to F(A) \\to F(B) \\to F(\\operatorname{Im}{j}) \\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad 0 \\to F(\\operatorname{Im}{j}) \\to F(C ) \\to F(\\operatorname{Coker}{j}).$$ Since the kernel of a map is not changed by postcomposing the map with a monomorphism (check this!), we have $$\\operatorname{Ker}{(F(B) \\to F(\\operatorname{Im}{j}))} = \\operatorname{Ker}{(F(B) \\to F(\\operatorname{Im}{j}) \\to F(C))},$$ so by functoriality of $F$ we get a left exact sequence $0 \\to F(A) \\to F(B) \\to F(C)$ as desired. A natural question is: When does $\\operatorname{Hom}(M,-)$ send short exact sequences to short exact sequences? In other words, when is $j_\\ast = \\operatorname{Hom}{(M,j)}$ an epimorphism for all short exact sequences $0\\; \\xrightarrow{\\phantom{ij}} \\; A \\; \\xrightarrow{i\\phantom{j}}\\; B\\; \\xrightarrow{j\\phantom{i}} \\; C \\to 0$? In view of left exactness of $\\operatorname{Hom}{(M,-)}$ the question is: Given any morphism $h: M \\to C$ and any epimorphism $j: B \\to C$, when is $h$ of the form $h = j_\\ast g$ for some morphism $g: M \\to B$? As you certainly know, this is precisely the definition of projective modules : $M$ is called projective if and only if $g$ always exists, for all epimorphisms $j: B \\twoheadrightarrow C$ and all $h: M \\to C$. For emphasis: A module $M$ is projective if and only if $\\operatorname{Hom}{(M,-)}$ is exact , that is: it sends short exact sequences to short exact sequences.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, the user wants to show that Hom(M, -) is left-exact. They have a sequence 0 → A → B → C which is left exact, and they need to show that applying Hom(M, -) gives another left exact sequence 0 → Hom(M, A) → Hom(M, B) → Hom(M, C). \n\nFirst, they mention that the key is to show the kernel of Hom(M, f) is equal to the image of Hom(M, i). The user provided their proof attempt, which seems to have two parts: one showing inclusion of the image in the kernel, and the converse. Let me parse their steps.\n\nFor the forward direction, if you take φ in Hom(M, A), then Hom(M, i)(φ) = i∘φ. Then applying Hom(M, f) to this gives f∘i∘φ. Since the original sequence is exact at B, im(i) = ker(f), so f∘i = 0. Therefore, f∘i∘φ = 0, which means i∘φ is in the kernel of Hom(M, f). So that part checks out.\n\nFor the reverse inclusion, suppose ψ is in Hom(M, B) such that Hom(M, f)(ψ) = f∘ψ = 0. Then the image of ψ is contained in ker(f) = im(i). Since i is injective, there's a unique map φ: M → A such that i∘φ = ψ. The user is trying to define φ as i^{-1}∘ψ, which makes sense because i is injective, hence invertible on its image. So φ = i^{-1}∘ψ would work. The user is concerned about the notation and whether this is rigorous. \n\nThey also mentioned their proof feels messy and asked for a cleaner version. Let me think. In category theory terms, since i is a monomorphism, it's left cancellable, but here we need to factor ψ through i. Since ψ(M) ⊆ i(A), and i is injective, we can define φ(m) as the unique element a in A such that i(a) = ψ(m). This φ is well-defined because i is injective, hence each ψ(m) has exactly one preimage in A. Then φ is a homomorphism because i and ψ are. That should work.\n\nRegarding the notation, maybe using more categorical language or emphasizing the universal property of kernels could make it cleaner. Alternatively, using element-chasing in the module context. Let me see. If f∘ψ = 0, then for every m in M, f(ψ(m)) = 0, so ψ(m) is in ker(f) = im(i). Since i is injective, for each m, there's a unique a_m in A with i(a_m) = ψ(m). Define φ: M → A by φ(m) = a_m. Need to check φ is R-linear. Let r be in R, m, n in M. Then ψ(rm + n) = rψ(m) + ψ(n) = r i(a_m) + i(a_n) = i(r a_m + a_n). Since i is injective, the preimage of this is r a_m + a_n, so φ(rm + n) = r a_m + a_n = r φ(m) + φ(n). Hence φ is linear. Therefore, ψ = i∘φ. So φ is in Hom(M, A), hence ψ is in the image of Hom(M, i). This seems more detailed but maybe clearer.\n\nThe user's trial uses i^{-1} as a map from im(i) to A, which is valid because i is an isomorphism onto its image. So i^{-1} exists as a map from im(i) to A, and then composing with ψ gives φ = i^{-1}∘ψ. But ψ maps M to im(i), so this is okay. The key is that i is injective, so i^{-1} is defined on im(i). Hence, φ is well-defined. The notation might be a bit confusing if not properly explained, but it's correct.\n\nSo overall, the user's approach is correct. The messiness might come from not explaining the steps in detail or the notation. Maybe breaking it down step by step, like defining φ explicitly as above, would make it clearer. Also, emphasizing that the injectivity of i allows the factoring through A.\n\nAnother point: Left exactness of Hom(M, -) requires that the sequence is exact at Hom(M, A) and Hom(M, B). The user focused on exactness at Hom(M, B), which is the kernel-image part. They might also need to show that Hom(M, i) is injective to have the full left exactness. Did the user address that? In their problem statement, they wrote the sequence starting at 0 → Hom(M, A) → Hom(M, B) → Hom(M, C), so to be left exact, Hom(M, i) must be injective and the image of Hom(M, i) must equal the kernel of Hom(M, f). The user's proof handles the kernel-image part. The injectivity of Hom(M, i) follows because i is injective. If φ, φ' in Hom(M, A) satisfy Hom(M, i)(φ) = Hom(M, i)(φ'), then i∘φ = i∘φ' pointwise, and since i is injective, φ(m) = φ'(m) for all m, hence φ = φ'. So Hom(M, i) is injective. Maybe the user didn't mention this, but it's part of proving left exactness. \n\nIn their question, they said they proved the above and highlighted the part they were unsure about, which is the kernel-image equality. So maybe the rest they are confident with. The main issue was justifying the factorization ψ = i∘φ. Their approach using i^{-1} is correct, but perhaps they feel it's not rigorous enough. By explicitly constructing φ as the preimage under i, as done in the element-wise approach, it becomes clearer.\n\nRegarding notation, maybe using diagrams or more categorical language could help, but in the context of modules, element-chasing is standard and acceptable. The key is to ensure each step is justified. The user's proof seems correct, just needs to be presented more clearly. Perhaps reorganizing the steps and adding explanations for why φ is well-defined and linear.\n\nSo, to structure the problem according to the given format, we need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. The original problem is about proving the left exactness of Hom(M, -). The assumptions would include that the original sequence 0 → A → B → C is left exact (i.e., exact at A and B), that M is an R-module, and the homomorphisms involved. However, looking at the example provided, the assumptions are specific conditions applied to the objects. \n\nIn the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, which are specific conditions on n. Translating to the Hom question: The assumptions would be that the given sequence is left exact (so it's exact at A and B), that M is an R-module, and perhaps that the morphisms are R-linear. But the problem statement already mentions that it's a left exact sequence of R-modules, and M is an R-module. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- The sequence 0 → A → B → C is left exact.\n- M is an R-module.\n- The morphisms i: A → B and f: B → C are R-linear.\n  \nBut since the exactness implies that i is injective and im(i) = ker(f), perhaps breaking it down:\n\n- The sequence 0 → A → B → C is a left exact sequence of R-modules.\n- i: A → B is an injective R-module homomorphism.\n- f: B → C is an R-module homomorphism with im(i) = ker(f).\n- M is an R-module.\n\nBut in the example, assumptions are listed as individual conditions on each object. So per the user's example format, each assumption should be a single condition on one object. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The sequence 0 → A → B → C is left exact.\n- M is an R-module.\n  \nBut maybe breaking down the left exactness into parts:\n\n- The homomorphism i: A → B is injective.\n- The image of i is equal to the kernel of f: B → C.\n- M is an R-module.\n\nBut the original problem statement says \"a left exact sequence of R-modules\", which inherently includes that i is injective and im(i) = ker(f). So perhaps in the assumption section, list that the sequence is left exact, and M is an R-module. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe sequence $0 \\to A \\xrightarrow{i} B \\xrightarrow{f} C$ is left exact,\n$M$ is an $R$-module.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the sequence\n$$\n0 \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_R(M,A) \\xrightarrow{\\operatorname{Hom}(M,i)} \\operatorname{Hom}_R(M,B) \\xrightarrow{\\operatorname{Hom}(M,f)} \\operatorname{Hom}_R(M,C)\n$$\nis left exact.\n\nBut the user's specific question was about showing the kernel of Hom(M,f) equals the image of Hom(M,i), which is the exactness at Hom(M,B). But the problem as stated in the original post is to prove the whole sequence is left exact, which includes exactness at Hom(M,A) (i.e., Hom(M,i) is injective) and exactness at Hom(M,B). So maybe the problem is to prove the entire left exactness, but the user's focus was on the kernel-image part. However, according to the example, the problem should be stated as in the original question, filtered. The original question's problem is: Prove that applying Hom(M,-) to the left exact sequence gives a left exact sequence. So the formatted problem should be:\n\nProblem: Prove that the sequence\n$$\n0 \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_R(M,A) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_R(M,B) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_R(M,C)\n$$\nis left exact.\n\nAssumptions would include the original sequence being left exact and M being an R-module. So following the example, each assumption on one line. The example had two assumptions: n is integer, n divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe sequence $0 \\to A \\to B \\to C$ is a left exact sequence of $R$-modules,\n$M$ is an $R$-module.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the sequence\n$$\n0 \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_R(M,A) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_R(M,B) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_R(M,C)\n$$\nis left exact.\n\nYes, that seems right. The original problem states that the given sequence is left exact of R-modules, and M is an R-module. These are the two main assumptions. The rest of the details (like i being injective, im(i)=ker(f)) are part of the left exactness, so they don't need to be listed separately unless specified. The example didn't break down the divisibility by 91 into 7 and 13, but just stated the divisibility by 7 as an assumption. So here, the left exactness is one assumption, and M being an R-module is another.",
