    "Content": "I read on Wikipedia the following claim: Any open topological $n$-ball is homeomorphic to the Cartesian space $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. No reason or proof was given. Can someone explain? I did try looking at other SE questions and didn't find anything I could understand. Thanks!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "We will show when we have a normed space $E$ and $r>0$, $E$ and its subset $B_r(0) = \\{x \\text{ }|\\text{ }\\|x\\| < r\\}$ are homeomorphic. $($Wikipedia gives a pretty okay primer on normed spaces, Normed vector space , if one has not seen them before.$)$ We start with a definition. Definition. A base , or basis for the topology on a topological space, is a collection $\\mathcal{F}$ of open sets such that for each open set $U$ is a union of sets in $\\mathcal{F}$. When a base for the topology on a space is fixed, we ofen refer to elements of $\\mathcal{F}$ as basic open sets . $($Often a topological space is defined by giving a set and a basis for the topology $($or a sub-basis, which is a collection of sets whose finite intersections form a basis$)$. In any metric space, balls are a basis for the topology, but for some purposes not the most convenient one. And some topological spaces are not metric spaces.$)$ Consider the following basis for the topology on a normed space. For each set $U$ which is open as a subset of $\\{x \\in E\\text{ }|\\text{ }\\|x\\| = 1\\}$, and for each ordered pair of positive reals $(a, b)$ the sets $\\{tu\\text{ }|\\text{ }a < t < b,\\, u \\in U\\}$, together with balls centered at $0$, form a basis. Indeed, it is easy to see that every ball is a union of such sets, and every such set is a union of balls. Also, the same collection of sets, except with the restriction $b \\le r$ is a basis for the topology on the open ball of radius $r$. Now, notice that the map$$f: B_r(0) \\to E,\\text{ }f(x) = {x\\over{r - \\|x\\|}}$$ is a bijection from the ball of radius $r$ to all of $E$, as we can explicitly write down the inverse $$g: E \\to B_r(0),\\text{ }g(y) = {{ry}\\over{1 + \\|y\\|}}.$$ Finally, we see that both $f$ and $g$ have the property that the inverse image of every basic open set is a basic open set, with respect to the bases we picked for $E$ and its ball of radius $r$. $U$ open implies $U$ is a union of basic open sets, so $f^{-1}(U)$ is a union of basic open sets, so $f^{-1}(U)$ is open. Thus $f$ is continuous, and $g$ is continuous by the same argument, so $f, g$ are homeomorphisms. $($This argument can be summarized as \"a bijection that induces a bijection of bases is a homeomorphism.\"$)$ In the interests of completeness, here are some details for showing $f$ is one-to-one and onto. $f(x)$ is one-to-one. Assume there are $x_1, x_2 \\in B_r(0)$ such that $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$. We have$${{x_1}\\over{r - \\|x_1\\|}} = {{x_2}\\over{r - \\|x_2\\|}} \\implies {{\\|x_1\\|}\\over{r - \\|x_1\\|}} = {{\\|x_2\\|}\\over{r - \\|x_2\\|}} \\implies \\|x_1\\|(r - \\|x_2\\|) = \\|x_2\\|(r - \\|x_1\\|) $$$$\\implies \\|x_1\\| = \\|x_2\\| \\implies {{x_1}\\over{r - \\|x_1\\|}} = {{x_2}\\over{r - \\|x_1\\|}} \\implies x_1 = x_2.$$ $f(x)$ is onto. Let $x \\in E$, and let $x' = rx/(1 + \\|x\\|)$. Consider$$f(x') = f\\left({{rx}\\over{1 + \\|x\\|}}\\right) = {{rx}\\over{1 + \\|x\\|}}\\left(r - \\Bigg\\|{{rx}\\over{1 + \\|x\\|}} \\Bigg\\|\\right)^{-1} = {{rx}\\over{1 + \\|x\\|}}\\left( {r\\over{1 + \\|x\\|}}\\right)^{-1} = x.$$Because$$\\Bigg\\|{{rx}\\over{1 + \\|x\\|}} \\Bigg\\| = {{r\\|x\\|}\\over{1 + \\|x\\|}} < r$$we have that $x' \\in B_r(0)$. Hence $f(x)$ is onto.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that I need to list assumptions and then state the problem. \n\nLooking at the original question: \"Is an open n-ball homeomorphic to ℝⁿ?\" The user mentions that the claim is from Wikipedia, and they're asking for an explanation or proof.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem is about topological spaces. An open n-ball is a concept in topology, so one assumption is that we're working within the context of topological spaces. Another point is that the ball is open, which is part of the definition. Also, the homeomorphism is between the open n-ball and ℝⁿ. Since ℝⁿ with the standard topology is a Cartesian space, that's another assumption. \n\nWait, the original question doesn't specify any particular conditions beyond the open n-ball and ℝⁿ. So the assumptions would include that the n-ball is an open subset in a topological space, and that ℝⁿ is considered with its standard topology. But the example given in the user's prompt had specific conditions like n being an integer and divisible by 7. However, in this case, the problem is more general. The key assumptions here are:\n\n1. The n-ball is an open topological n-ball.\n2. The space in question is a topological space (since homeomorphism is a topological concept).\n3. The Cartesian space ℝⁿ is considered with its standard topology.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is more straightforward. The original claim is that any open topological n-ball is homeomorphic to ℝⁿ. So the main assumptions are that we have an open n-ball in a topological space, and we consider ℝⁿ with its standard topology. However, the problem is to show the homeomorphism, so maybe the assumptions are just the basic premises given. \n\nIn the example provided, the assumption listed was \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But in this case, the problem is about any open n-ball. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- Consider an open topological n-ball.\n- Consider the Cartesian space ℝⁿ with its standard topology.\n\nBut do I need to list that n is a positive integer? Because an n-ball implies n is a positive integer. So maybe that's another assumption. However, the original problem didn't specify n, but in topology, n is typically a positive integer. So maybe:\n\nAssumptions:\n- n is a positive integer.\n- The n-ball is an open topological ball.\n- The Cartesian space ℝⁿ is equipped with its standard topology.\n\nBut the problem statement is \"Is an open n-ball homeomorphic to ℝⁿ?\" So the assumptions are inherent in the question. The problem is to prove that any open topological n-ball is homeomorphic to ℝⁿ. So the key points are the open n-ball and ℝⁿ with standard topology. The example given in the user's prompt included specific conditions on n, but here, the only condition is that it's an open n-ball. \n\nSo structuring the problem:\n\nAssumption:\nThe n-ball is an open topological n-ball,\nThe Cartesian space ℝⁿ is considered with its standard topology.\n\nProblem: Prove that any open topological n-ball is homeomorphic to ℝⁿ.\n\nBut maybe the problem is just the question as stated. Let me check the original question again. The user wrote: \"Is an open n-ball homeomorphic to ℝⁿ?\" and wants it structured into assumptions and problem. The example had the problem restated with the assumptions listed. So in this case, the assumptions would be the conditions given in the problem. However, the problem as stated is a yes/no question but the user wants to structure it as a problem to prove. So perhaps the problem is to prove the claim, hence the problem statement would be \"Prove that an open topological n-ball is homeomorphic to ℝⁿ.\"\n\nThe assumptions would then be the necessary conditions for this proof. Since the problem is about any open n-ball, the assumptions are that we're dealing with an open topological n-ball and ℝⁿ with standard topology. Also, n is a positive integer, but that's implied by the term n-ball. So the assumptions are:\n\n- Let B be an open topological n-ball.\n- Equip ℝⁿ with its standard topology.\n\nBut maybe the problem is more general. Alternatively, the assumption might be that the space is Euclidean, but the question is about any open topological n-ball, not necessarily embedded in Euclidean space. Wait, the original question says \"any open topological n-ball\", so it's a general topological space. So the assumptions are:\n\n- B is an open topological n-ball in some topological space.\n- ℝⁿ is the Cartesian space with standard topology.\n\nBut to make it precise, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nB is an open topological n-ball,\nn is a positive integer,\nℝⁿ is considered with the standard Euclidean topology.\n\nProblem:\nProve that B is homeomorphic to ℝⁿ.\n\nBut the original problem didn't specify n being positive, but in the context, n is a dimension, so it's a positive integer. The example given had specific conditions on n, but here it's part of the object's definition. So I think this is the correct structure. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nB is an open topological n-ball,\nn is a positive integer,\nℝⁿ is equipped with the standard Euclidean topology.\n\nProblem:\nProve that B is homeomorphic to ℝⁿ.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the user included only the necessary assumptions. For instance, in the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7. However, the original problem here doesn't have such specific conditions. It's a general topological statement. So perhaps the key assumptions are that B is an open topological n-ball and ℝⁿ is in its standard topology. The positive integer n is inherent in the definition of an n-ball, so maybe it's redundant to list it as an assumption. Alternatively, maybe not. Let's see.\n\nIn the example, the user listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, even though the problem statement says \"for every integer n\". So perhaps in the example, the user extracted the assumptions from the problem statement. In this case, the problem statement is \"Is an open n-ball homeomorphic to ℝⁿ?\" which implicitly assumes that n is a positive integer (since n-ball requires n to be a positive integer). So maybe the assumptions should include that n is a positive integer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to show that for any n (positive integer), an open n-ball is homeomorphic to ℝⁿ. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is a positive integer,\n- B is an open topological n-ball,\n- ℝⁿ has the standard Euclidean topology.\n\nBut in the example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the assumptions were n is an integer and divisible by 7. So the problem in the example had additional constraints. Here, the problem is general for any n, but in the example, the assumption was a specific condition. Therefore, in this case, the problem is general, so the assumptions would be the definitions involved.\n\nThus, the formatted problem should list the assumptions as:\n\nAssumption:\nB is an open topological n-ball,\nn is a positive integer,\nℝⁿ is a Cartesian space with the standard topology.\n\nProblem:\nProve that B is homeomorphic to ℝⁿ.\n\nI think this is correct. The key points are that B is an open n-ball in topology, n is positive, and ℝⁿ is standard. So the answer should follow this structure.",
