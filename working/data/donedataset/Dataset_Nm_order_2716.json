    "Content": "How to prove that $\\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, we have\n  \\begin{align}\n\\sum_{k=1}^{n}\\frac{|\\sin{kx}|}{k}\\ge |\\sin{nx}| ?\n\\end{align} I know that this partial sum will diverge for $x\\not = m\\pi$, but I don't know how to prove this inequality. I have tried Abel summation, but it doesn't work because I can't give a lower bound for $\\sum |\\sin{kx}|$. Thanks for your attention.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Given $n\\ge 1$ and $x\\in \\Bbb R$, denote \n$$f_n(x)=\\sum_{k=1}^n\\frac{|\\sin kx|}{k} \\quad\\text{and}\\quad  g_n(x)=f_n(x)-|\\sin nx|.$$ Lemma: For every $n\\ge 1$, (i) $f_n$ is increasing on $[0,\\frac{\\pi}{n+1}]$;\n   (ii) $g_n$ is increasing on $[0,\\frac{\\pi}n]$;\n   (iii) $f_n\\ge 1$ on $[\\frac{\\pi}{2n},\\frac{\\pi}{2}]$. Proof of Lemma: Note that when $x\\in [0,\\frac{\\pi}n]$, \n$$f_n(x)=\\sum_{k=1}^n\\frac{\\sin kx}{k},\\quad\\text{and}\\quad g_n(x)=f_n(x)-\\sin nx,$$\nso \n$$f_n'(x)=\\sum_{k=1}^n \\cos kx \\quad\\text{and}\\quad g_n'(x)=f_n'(x)-n\\cos nx.$$\n(i) Given $x\\in[0,\\frac{\\pi}{n+1}]$, noting that $\\cos\\frac{kx}{2}\\ge 0$ for $k=0,\\pm1,\\dots, \\pm (n+1)$, we have\n$$f_n'(x)=\\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{\\cos kx +\\cos(n+1-k)x}{2}=\\cos \\frac{(n+1)x}{2} \\cdot\\sum_{k=1}^n \\cos\\frac{(n+1-2k)x}{2}\\ge 0.$$ (ii) Since the cosine function is decreasing on $[0,\\pi]$, when $x\\in [0,\\frac{\\pi}{n}]$,  $\\cos k x\\ge \\cos nx$ for $k=1,\\dots,n$, so $g'(x)\\ge 0$. (iii) When $n=1$,  the statement is clearly true; when $n=2$, since $f_2$ is concave on $[\\frac{\\pi}{4},\\frac{\\pi}{2}]$, $f_2(\\frac{\\pi}{4})>1$ and $f_2(\\frac{\\pi}{2})=1$, the statement is also true. By induction, we may assume that $f_{n-1}\\ge 1$ on $[\\frac{\\pi}{2(n-1)},\\frac{\\pi}{2}]$ for some $n \\ge 3$, and the conclusion $f_n\\ge 1$ on $[\\frac{\\pi}{2n},\\frac{\\pi}{2}]$ follows from the facts below. Firstly, $f_n\\ge f_{n-1}$; secondly, $f_n$ is increasing on $[0,\\frac{\\pi}{n+1}]\\supset [\\frac{\\pi}{2n},\\frac{\\pi}{2(n-1)}]$; thirdly, \n$$\\sin \\frac{\\pi t}{2}\\ge t,\\ \\forall t\\in[0,1]\\Longrightarrow f_n(\\frac{\\pi}{2n})=\\sum_{k=1}^n\\frac{\\sin \\frac{k\\pi}{2n}}{k}\\ge 1.\\qquad \\square$$ Now we can prove that $g_n\\ge 0$ by using the lemma. Since $g_n(\\pi\\pm x)=g_n(x)$, we may focus on $x\\in[0,\\frac{\\pi}{2}]$. Since $g_n(0)=0$, by (ii), we know that $g_n(x)\\ge 0$ on $[0,\\frac{\\pi}{n}]$. Since $g_n\\ge f_n -1$, by (iii) we know that $g_n\\ge 0$ on $[\\frac{\\pi}{2n},\\frac{\\pi}{2}]$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. The example provided shows that the assumptions should be broken down into individual conditions applied to one object each. The problem statement should then be restated clearly.\n\nLooking at the original problem: The inequality involves partial sums of |sin(kx)|/k and needs to be proven for all real x and natural numbers n. The user tried Abel summation but couldn't find a lower bound. The title mentions the inequality, and the question body reiterates it.\n\nFirst, identifying the assumptions. The problem states \"for all x in R\" and \"n in N\". So those are two separate assumptions. Each should be listed on its own line. The example had two assumptions: one about n being an integer and another about divisibility by 7. Here, similarly, x is a real number and n is a natural number. The original problem doesn't mention any additional constraints beyond x being real and n being a natural number. The user also mentions that the partial sum diverges for x not equal to mπ, but that's part of their knowledge, not an assumption of the problem. The actual problem statement doesn't include that as a condition, so it's not part of the assumptions to list.\n\nSo the assumptions should be:\n\n- x is a real number.\n- n is a natural number.\n\nThe problem is to prove the inequality involving the sum from k=1 to n of |sin(kx)|/k being greater than or equal to |sin(nx)|.\n\nI need to make sure that the problem is restated correctly, preserving the mathematical expression. The original problem uses align environment, but in the formatted version, it's written as a single-line equation using $$. Also, checking for any other conditions. The user mentions they tried Abel summation, but that's part of their attempt, not part of the problem's assumptions. So the assumptions are strictly what is given in the problem statement: x in R and n in N.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have two assumptions and the problem statement as given.",
