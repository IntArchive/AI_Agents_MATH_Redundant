    "AcceptedAnswer": "This answer is a long one, sorry. For complex $q$ with $|q|<1$, introduce Ramanujan's functions $P(q),Q(q)$:\n$$P(q) = 1 - 24\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\sigma(n)\\,q^n$$\n$$Q(q) = 1 + 240\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\sigma_3(n)\\,q^n$$ The left-hand side of your first formula can be understood as\nthe coefficient of $q^{2^n}$ in the square of the power series\n$$f(q) = \\sum_{m=1}^\\infty \\sigma(2m-1)\\,q^{2m-1}\n= \\frac{1}{48}\\left(P(-q)-P(q)\\right)$$\nSo we are interested in $f(q)^2$ expressed as a power series in $q$. Proposition: We have\n$$f(q)^2 = \\frac{1}{240}\\left(Q(q^2)-Q(q^4)\\right)$$ Once this is  proven, we can conclude that\n$$f(q)^2 = \\sum_{m=1}^\\infty \\left(\\sigma_3(2m-1)\\,q^{4m-2} +\n\\left(\\sigma_3(2m) - \\sigma_3(m)\\right)\\,q^{4m}\\right)$$\nThus, the coefficient of $q^{2^n}$ turns out to be\n$\\sigma_3(1) = 1$ for $n=1$ and\n$$\\sigma_3(2^{n-1}) - \\sigma_3(2^{n-2}) = 2^{3(n-1)} = 8^{n-1}$$\nfor $n>1$, so it is indeed $8^{n-1}$ for all positive integers $n$. It remains to prove the proposition. To that end, let $\\mathbb{H}$ the complex upper half-plane,\nand introduce a new independent variable $\\tau\\in\\mathbb{H}$\nthat determines\n$$q = \\mathrm{e}^{2\\pi\\mathrm{i}\\tau}$$\nso $|q|<1$.\nFurthermore, for positive integer $k$ let\n$$q_k = \\mathrm{e}^{2\\pi\\mathrm{i}\\tau/k}$$\nso $q_k^k = q$. By means of these dependencies, we can consider $q$-series\nas functions of $\\tau$.\nThis leads us to the normalized Eisenstein series\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\t\\mathrm{E}_2(\\tau) &= P(q)\n\\\\\t\\mathrm{E}_4(\\tau) &= Q(q)\n\\end{aligned}$$\nI will also use the Jacobi thetanull functions (as functions of $\\tau$):\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\t\\Theta_{00}(\\tau) &= \\sum_{m\\in\\mathbb{Z}}q_2^{m^2}\n\\\\\t\\Theta_{01}(\\tau) &= \\sum_{m\\in\\mathbb{Z}}(-q_2)^{m^2}\n\\\\\t\\Theta_{10}(\\tau) &= \\sum_{m\\in\\mathbb{Z}} q_8^{(2m+1)^2} =\n\t2\\,q_8\\sum_{m=0}^\\infty q^{m (m+1)/2}\n\\end{aligned}$$ Background on those functions is given in textbooks such as: (Theta functions) E. T. Whittaker and G. N. Watson,\nA Course of Modern Analysis;\n2nd edition 1915; Merchant Books, reprint 2008, ISBN 1-60386-121-1;\n1st edition 1902. (Eisenstein series) Tom M. Apostol,\nModular Functions and Dirichlet Series in Number Theory;\n2nd edition 1990; Springer, ISBN 0-387-97127-0; 1st edition 1976. Let us prove, as a first lemma, the frequently used triplet of identities\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\t3\\,\\Theta_{00}^4(\\tau) &=\n\t4\\,\\mathrm{E}_2(2\\tau)-\\mathrm{E}_2\\left(\\frac{\\tau}{2}\\right)\n\\\\\t3\\,\\Theta_{01}^4(\\tau) &=\n\t4\\,\\mathrm{E}_2(2\\tau)-\\mathrm{E}_2\\left(\\frac{\\tau+1}{2}\\right)\n\\\\\t3\\,\\Theta_{10}^4(\\tau) &=\n\t\\mathrm{E}_2\\left(\\frac{\\tau+1}{2}\\right) -\n\t\\mathrm{E}_2\\left(\\frac{\\tau}{2}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}$$\nthe last of which can be translated to\n$$f(q_2) = \\left(\\frac{\\Theta_{10}(\\tau)}{2}\\right)^4$$\nwhich gives yet another representation for our function $f$. The second lemma shall comprise the three identities\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\t\\Theta_{00}^8(\\tau) &=\n\t\\frac{1}{15}\\left(16\\,\\mathrm{E}_4(\\tau) -\n\t\\mathrm{E}_4\\left(\\frac{\\tau+1}{2}\\right)\\right)\n\\\\\t\\Theta_{01}^8(\\tau) &=\n\t\\frac{1}{15}\\left(16\\,\\mathrm{E}_4(\\tau) -\n\t\\mathrm{E}_4\\left(\\frac{\\tau}{2}\\right)\\right)\n\\\\\t\\Theta_{10}^8(\\tau) &=\n\t\\frac{16}{15}\\left(\\mathrm{E}_4(\\tau)-\\mathrm{E}_4(2\\tau)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}$$\nthe last of which can ultimately be translated to\n$$f(q_2)^2 = \\frac{1}{240}\\left(Q(q)-Q(q^2)\\right)$$\nwhich is the proposition we need. Why should we prove six identities although we only need two of them?\nWell, it turns out that the three Jacobi thetanulls are best dealt with\naltogether, otherwise things become less elementary.\nFurthermore, this is the third occasion within a fortnight\nthat such identities find applications on this site\n(look here and there ),\nso I think it is useful to have a package of them in a place we can link to.\nAnd last but not least, it's fun. The plan is to find certain (modular) symmetries of expressions containing\nthe above functions of $\\tau$;\nthen to use the fact that, up to some constant factor, only one function can\nhave such symmetries.\nTo prepare the ground, let us recall the most basic facts about the above\nEisenstein series and Jacobi thetanull functions that we will need. First, all those functions are holomorphic for $\\tau\\in\\mathbb{H}$\nand can be represented as a Maclaurin series in $q_k$ for some $k$,\nas demonstrated by the definitions given.\n(This implies that they approach a finite limit as $\\Im\\tau\\to\\infty$.) Second, the thetanull functions $\\Theta_{00}(\\tau), \\Theta_{01}(\\tau),\n\\Theta_{10}(\\tau)$ are nonzero for every $\\tau\\in\\mathbb{H}$\nwhich implies that their reciprocals are holomorphic over $\\mathbb{H}$ too. Third, we have the following useful symmetries:\nLet $\\tau' = \\frac{-1}{\\tau}$, then\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\t\\mathrm{E}_2(\\tau+1) &= \\mathrm{E}_2(\\tau)\n&\t\\mathrm{E}_2(\\tau') &=\n\t\\frac{6\\tau}{\\pi\\,\\mathrm{i}} + \\tau^2\\,\\mathrm{E}_2(\\tau)\n\\\\\t\\mathrm{E}_4(\\tau+1) &= \\mathrm{E}_4(\\tau)\n&\t\\mathrm{E}_4(\\tau') &= \\tau^4\\,\\mathrm{E}_4(\\tau)\n\\\\\t\\Theta_{00}(\\tau+1) &= \\Theta_{01}(\\tau)\n&\t\\Theta_{00}(\\tau') &= \\sqrt{-\\mathrm{i}\\tau}\\,\\Theta_{00}(\\tau)\n\\\\\t\\Theta_{01}(\\tau+1) &= \\Theta_{00}(\\tau)\n&\t\\Theta_{01}(\\tau') &= \\sqrt{-\\mathrm{i}\\tau}\\,\\Theta_{10}(\\tau)\n\\\\\t\\Theta_{10}(\\tau+1) &= \\sqrt{\\mathrm{i}}\\,\\Theta_{10}(\\tau)\n&\t\\Theta_{10}(\\tau') &= \\sqrt{-\\mathrm{i}\\tau}\\,\\Theta_{01}(\\tau)\n\\end{aligned}$$ The fourth useful fact seems to be rarely mentioned in introductory texts,\nbut it is easy to conclude from the stuff covered there.\nConcretely, the coefficients of the Eisenstein $q$-series, that is, the\ndivisor power sums $\\sigma_k(n)$, have a certain multiplicativity property\nthat translates into functional equations for the Eisenstein series.\nParticularly, we have:\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\t\\mathrm{E}_2\\left(\\frac{\\tau}{2}\\right) +\n\t\\mathrm{E}_2\\left(\\frac{\\tau+1}{2}\\right) +\n\t4\\,\\mathrm{E}_2(2\\tau) &= 6\\,\\mathrm{E}_2(\\tau)\n\\\\\t\\mathrm{E}_4\\left(\\frac{\\tau}{2}\\right) +\n\t\\mathrm{E}_4\\left(\\frac{\\tau+1}{2}\\right) +\n\t16\\,\\mathrm{E}_4(2\\tau) &= 18\\,\\mathrm{E}_4(\\tau)\n\\end{aligned}$$\nThis allows us to express an Eisenstein series with argument $\\frac{\\tau+1}{2}$\nin terms of the Eisenstein series with arguments $\\frac{\\tau}{2}$, $\\tau$, and\n$2\\tau$.\nWhy would we want to do that?\nBecause the latter can easily be subjected to the transformation $\\tau\\to\\tau'$.\nDoing so and substituting back, we find the remarkable symmetries\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\t\\mathrm{E}_2\\left(\\frac{\\tau'+1}{2}\\right) &=\n\t\\frac{12\\tau}{\\pi\\,\\mathrm{i}} +\n\t\\tau^2\\,\\mathrm{E}_2\\left(\\frac{\\tau+1}{2}\\right)\n\\\\\t\\mathrm{E}_4\\left(\\frac{\\tau'+1}{2}\\right) &=\n\t\\tau^4\\,\\mathrm{E}_4\\left(\\frac{\\tau+1}{2}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}$$ Now that the basics are in place, consider the functions\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\tU_{00}(\\tau) &= \\frac\n\t{4\\,\\mathrm{E}_2(2\\tau)-\\mathrm{E}_2\\left(\\frac{\\tau}{2}\\right)}\n\t{3\\,\\Theta_{00}^4(\\tau)}\n\\\\\tU_{01}(\\tau) &= \\frac\n\t{4\\,\\mathrm{E}_2(2\\tau)-\\mathrm{E}_2\\left(\\frac{\\tau+1}{2}\\right)}\n\t{3\\,\\Theta_{01}^4(\\tau)}\n\\\\\tU_{10}(\\tau) &= \\frac\n\t{\\mathrm{E}_2\\left(\\frac{\\tau+1}{2}\\right) -\n\t\\mathrm{E}_2\\left(\\frac{\\tau}{2}\\right)}\n\t{3\\,\\Theta_{10}^4(\\tau)}\n\\end{aligned}$$\nProving the first lemma is equivalent to showing that\n$U_{00}, U_{01}, U_{10}$ are all equal to the constant $1$. As the Eisenstein series and the Jacobi thetanulls are holomorphic over\n$\\mathbb{H}$, and the Jacobi thetanulls are furthermore nonzero on $\\mathbb{H}$,\nwe find that $U_{00}, U_{01}, U_{10}$ are holomorphic over $\\mathbb{H}$ as well. By considering the given series expansions of their constituents,\nwe find that $U_{00}, U_{01}, U_{10}$ can be represented\nas Maclaurin series in $q_2$:\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\tU_{00} &= \\frac{4\\,P(q^2)-P(q_2)}{3\\,\\Theta_{00}^4} =\n\t\\frac{3 + \\mathrm{O}(q_2)}{3 + \\mathrm{O}(q_2)} =\n\t1 + \\mathrm{O}(q_2)\n\\\\\tU_{01} &= \\frac{4\\,P(q^2)-P(-q_2)}{3\\,\\Theta_{01}^4} =\n\t\\frac{3 + \\mathrm{O}(q_2)}{3 + \\mathrm{O}(q_2)} =\n\t1 + \\mathrm{O}(q_2)\n\\\\\tU_{10} &= \\frac{P(-q_2) - P(q_2)}{3\\,\\Theta_{10}^4} =\n\t\\frac{48 q_2 + \\mathrm{O}(q_2^3)}{48 q_2 + \\mathrm{O}(q_2^3)} =\n\t1 + \\mathrm{O}(q_2^2)\n\\end{aligned}$$ Using the symmetries presented above, we find after some calculation\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\tU_{00}(\\tau+1) &= U_{01}(\\tau)\n&\tU_{00}(\\tau') &= U_{00}(\\tau)\n\\\\\tU_{01}(\\tau+1) &= U_{00}(\\tau)\n&\tU_{01}(\\tau') &= U_{10}(\\tau)\n\\\\\tU_{10}(\\tau+1) &= U_{10}(\\tau)\n&\tU_{10}(\\tau') &= U_{01}(\\tau)\n\\end{aligned}$$ Together this implies that the functions\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\tC_1 &= U_{00} + U_{01} + U_{10}\n\\\\\tC_2 &= U_{00}\\,U_{01} + U_{00}\\,U_{10} + U_{01}\\,U_{10}\n\\\\\tC_3 &= U_{00}\\,U_{01}\\,U_{10}\n\\end{aligned}$$\nare holomorphic over $\\mathbb{H}$, representable as Maclaurin series in $q_2$,\nand invariant under the transformations $\\tau\\to\\tau+1$ and $\\tau\\to\\tau'$.\nThe first invariance also implies that the $q_2$-series only involve integer\npowers of $q = q_2^2$. This means that $C_1,C_2,C_3$ are so-called entire modular forms of weight zero.\nHowever, as shown e.g. in the text by Apostol (reference 2 above),\nthe only entire modular forms of weight zero are constants.\nFrom this very fact we can now draw our conclusions. Hence each $C_i$ must equal the constant term of its $q$-series, so\n$$C_1 = 3\\qquad C_2 = 3\\qquad C_3 = 1$$\nindependent of $\\tau$. Recall that, by Vieta's formulae, the solutions of the equation\n$$U^3 - C_1\\,U^2 + C_2\\,U - C_3 = 0$$\nare precisely $U\\in\\{U_{00}, U_{01}, U_{10}\\}$.\nNow, since the equation amounts to $(U-1)^3 = 0$, we conclude that\n$$U_{00} = U_{01} = U_{10} = 1 = \\mathrm{const.}$$\nThus, the first lemma is proven. In the very same manner, we can easily tackle the second lemma.\nYou know what? I leave that to you, it's refreshing. Edit: Typo corrections.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The problem is to prove that for a positive integer n, the sum from k=1 to 2^{n-1} of σ(2^n - 2k + 1)σ(2k - 1) equals 8^{n-1}, where σ(N) is the sum of divisors of N. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what σ(N) does. It's just adding up all the divisors of N. For example, σ(6) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12. So in this problem, we're dealing with two σ terms multiplied together for specific arguments and summed over a certain range.\n\nLooking at the summation limits: k goes from 1 to 2^{n-1}. Each term in the sum involves σ evaluated at two numbers: 2^n - 2k + 1 and 2k - 1. Let's see if there's a pattern in these arguments. For each k, the arguments are 2k - 1 (which is an odd number) and 2^n - 2k + 1. Let's compute these for small n to see if there's a relationship.\n\nTake n=1: Then the sum is from k=1 to 2^{0}=1. So k=1. The arguments are 2^1 - 2*1 +1=2-2+1=1 and 2*1 -1=1. So the term is σ(1)σ(1) = 1*1=1. The right side is 8^{0}=1. So it works for n=1.\n\nn=2: Sum from k=1 to 2^{1}=2. Let's compute each term:\n\nFor k=1: 2^2 - 2*1 +1=4-2+1=3, and 2*1 -1=1. So σ(3)σ(1)=(1+3)(1)=4.\n\nFor k=2: 2^2 - 2*2 +1=4-4+1=1, and 2*2 -1=3. So σ(1)σ(3)=1*(1+3)=4. Sum is 4+4=8. Right side is 8^{1}=8. Good.\n\nn=3: Sum from k=1 to 4. Let's check:\n\nk=1: 8 -2 +1=7; 2*1 -1=1. σ(7)σ(1)=8*1=8\n\nk=2: 8 -4 +1=5; 3. σ(5)σ(3)=6*4=24\n\nk=3: 8 -6 +1=3; 5. σ(3)σ(5)=4*6=24\n\nk=4: 8 -8 +1=1; 7. σ(1)σ(7)=1*8=8\n\nSum: 8+24+24+8=64. 8^{2}=64. Correct.\n\nSo the pattern holds for n=1,2,3. Now, we need to find a general proof.\n\nLooking at the terms, the arguments of σ are 2k-1 and 2^n - 2k +1. Notice that for each k, these two numbers add up to 2^n - 2k +1 + 2k -1 = 2^n. So each pair (2k-1, 2^n -2k +1) are pairs of numbers that add up to 2^n. Also, since 2k-1 is odd and 2^n is even, both numbers in the pair are odd. So each pair consists of two odd numbers adding to 2^n. \n\nMoreover, since k ranges from 1 to 2^{n-1}, the first term 2k-1 ranges from 1 to 2^n -1 (since when k=2^{n-1}, 2k=2^n, so 2k-1=2^n -1). So each pair (a, b) with a + b = 2^n, a and b odd, and a < b or a > b depending on k. But since 2k-1 increases as k increases, and 2^n -2k +1 decreases as k increases, each pair is unique. For example, when k=1, a=1 and b=2^n -1; when k=2, a=3 and b=2^n -3; etc., up to k=2^{n-1}, a=2^n -1 and b=1. Wait, but since the sum is symmetric, the terms σ(a)σ(b) and σ(b)σ(a) are the same. So maybe there's a symmetry here.\n\nBut in the summation, each pair (a,b) is only counted once. Wait, when k=1, we have (1, 2^n -1), and when k=2^{n-1}, we have (2^n -1,1). But in the sum, these two would contribute σ(1)σ(2^n -1) and σ(2^n -1)σ(1), which are the same. Wait, but in the example for n=2, we had (1,3) and (3,1), but in the sum, they are both included as separate terms. However, when n=2, 2^{n-1}=2, so k=1 and k=2 give (1,3) and (3,1). But in the problem statement, the sum is from k=1 to 2^{n-1}, which includes both terms. So actually, each pair (a,b) where a + b = 2^n, both a and b odd, and a < 2^n, is included once, but since a and b can be swapped depending on k. Wait, but for each a and b, a + b = 2^n, and both are odd. For example, for n=3, the pairs are (1,7), (3,5), (5,3), (7,1). But in the sum for n=3, when k=1 to 4, we have (1,7), (3,5), (5,3), (7,1). So each pair is counted twice except when a = b, but since 2^n is even and a and b are odd, a cannot equal b. So the pairs are unique but reversed. However, in the sum, each pair is counted twice, but the terms σ(a)σ(b) and σ(b)σ(a) are the same. Hence, the sum can be considered as twice the sum over a < b of σ(a)σ(b). But wait, for n=3, we have four terms, which are two distinct pairs each counted twice. However, the total sum is 64=8^2. So maybe the key is that the sum over all pairs (a,b) where a + b = 2^n, a and b odd, of σ(a)σ(b) equals 8^{n-1}.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum is multiplicative over factors of 2. Since 2^n is a power of 2, and a and b are odd, their sum is 2^n. So if we can factor σ(a)σ(b) when a + b = 2^n, maybe there's a multiplicative property.\n\nAlternatively, consider generating functions or use induction. Let's try induction. For n=1, we saw it's true. Assume it's true for n, prove for n+1.\n\nBut let's see: For n+1, the sum would be from k=1 to 2^{n} terms. Each term is σ(2^{n+1} - 2k +1)σ(2k -1). Hmm, but how does this relate to the previous case? Not immediately obvious.\n\nAlternatively, consider that σ is multiplicative. Since a and b are coprime (since they are both odd and sum to 2^n, which is a power of 2, their gcd is 1). Therefore, σ(ab) = σ(a)σ(b). Wait, but here we have σ(a)σ(b) where a + b = 2^n. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe relate this to the theory of modular forms or generating functions. The paper linked by the user (advancesindifferenceequations.com/content/pdf/1687-1847-2013-84.pdf) might have similar identities. Let me check (even though I can't access it, maybe the title or context helps). The title is \"Advances in Difference Equations\", which suggests it involves recurrence relations. Maybe the problem can be approached using recurrence.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the sum S(n) = sum_{k=1}^{2^{n-1}} σ(2^n - 2k +1)σ(2k -1). We need to show S(n) = 8^{n-1}. Let's compute S(n) for small n:\n\nn=1: S(1)=σ(1)σ(1)=1*1=1=8^{0}=1\n\nn=2: S(2)=σ(3)σ(1) + σ(1)σ(3)=4+4=8=8^1\n\nn=3: S(3)=8+24+24+8=64=8^2\n\nn=4: Let's predict S(4)=8^3=512. Let's check (though this might take time). But the pattern seems to be S(n)=8^{n-1}. So maybe we can find a recurrence S(n+1)=8*S(n). If we can show that, then by induction, since S(1)=1=8^0, it would hold.\n\nTo check S(n+1)=8*S(n), consider how the sum for n+1 relates to the sum for n. The sum for n+1 is over k=1 to 2^{n}, and each term is σ(2^{n+1}-2k+1)σ(2k-1). Let's see if this can be expressed in terms of S(n).\n\nPerhaps split the sum into even and odd k. Let k = 2m and k=2m-1. Wait, but k ranges from 1 to 2^{n}. Let’s try to express k as m and relate to n-1.\n\nAlternatively, substitute k = 2^{n-1} + m, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, note that 2^{n+1} - 2k +1 = 2*(2^n) -2k +1. Maybe express this as 2*(2^n -k) +1. Similarly, 2k -1 = 2k -1.\n\nBut how does this relate to the previous terms? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider generating the terms for n+1 by pairing terms. For example, when n increases by 1, the number of terms doubles. Maybe each term in S(n) generates two terms in S(n+1), each scaled by 8. But how?\n\nAlternatively, consider that σ is multiplicative. For odd numbers a and b, since they are coprime to 2, and 2^n is a power of 2, maybe we can factor something. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that the sum over a + b = 2^n, a,b odd, of σ(a)σ(b) = 8^{n-1}. Maybe this can be approached by generating functions. Consider generating function F(x) = sum_{a odd} σ(a) x^a. Then the sum in question is the coefficient of x^{2^n} in F(x)^2. But need to compute that coefficient.\n\nCompute F(x) = sum_{m=1, odd} σ(m) x^m. Then F(x)^2 = sum_{m,n odd} σ(m)σ(n) x^{m+n}. The coefficient of x^{2^k} is exactly the sum we're interested in. So if we can show that this coefficient is 8^{k-1}, then the identity holds.\n\nAlternatively, recall that σ is related to generating functions. The generating function for σ(m) is sum_{m=1}^∞ σ(m) x^m = sum_{d=1}^∞ sum_{k=1}^∞ d x^{dk} = sum_{d=1}^∞ d x^d / (1 - x^d). But this is for all m. If we restrict to odd m, then sum_{m odd} σ(m) x^m = sum_{d odd} sum_{k odd} d x^{d k}. Wait, maybe not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, consider that for odd m, σ(m) can be expressed in terms of divisors. For example, since m is odd, all its divisors are odd. So σ(m) is the sum of odd divisors of m.\n\nWait, there's a known identity related to the sum of divisors of odd numbers. Maybe use that the generating function for σ(m) where m is odd is related to a product formula. For example:\n\nsum_{m odd} σ(m) x^m = product_{p odd prime} (1 + (σ(p) x^p + σ(p^2) x^{p^2} + ... ) )\n\nBut this might get complicated. Alternatively, use the fact that the sum over odd m of σ(m) x^m = x/(1 - x)^2 * product_{k=1}^∞ (1 + x^{2k} + x^{2*2k} + ... ) ). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, note that for the generating function F(x) = sum_{m odd} σ(m) x^m, then F(x) = sum_{d odd} d * sum_{k odd} x^{d k} = sum_{d odd} d * x^d / (1 - x^{2d}). Hmm, this seems complex.\n\nAlternatively, take the square of F(x):\n\nF(x)^2 = (sum_{a odd} σ(a) x^a)(sum_{b odd} σ(b) x^b) = sum_{n=1}^∞ (sum_{a + b = n, a,b odd} σ(a)σ(b)) x^n.\n\nWe need the coefficient of x^{2^k} in this to be 8^{k-1}.\n\nSuppose for n=2^k, the coefficient is 8^{k-1}. Let's check for k=1: coefficient at x^2 is sum_{a + b=2, a,b odd} σ(a)σ(b). The only possible a=1, b=1. So σ(1)σ(1)=1*1=1. But 8^{1-1}=1, which matches. For k=2: coefficient at x^4. Possible pairs: (1,3), (3,1). Sum is σ(1)σ(3) + σ(3)σ(1)=1*4 +4*1=8=8^{2-1}=8, which matches. For k=3: x^8 coefficient. Pairs: (1,7), (3,5), (5,3), (7,1). Sum is σ(1)σ(7)+σ(3)σ(5)+σ(5)σ(3)+σ(7)σ(1)=1*8 +4*6 +6*4 +8*1=8+24+24+8=64=8^{3-1}=64. So it works. Thus, the coefficient of x^{2^n} in F(x)^2 is indeed 8^{n-1}.\n\nTherefore, if we can prove that the generating function F(x)^2 has coefficients at x^{2^n} equal to 8^{n-1}, then the identity holds. But how to prove this?\n\nAlternatively, consider that F(x) = sum_{m odd} σ(m) x^m. Note that σ(m) for m odd is multiplicative, so F(x) can be expressed as a product over primes. For odd primes p, the generating function for σ(p^k) is 1 + σ(p) x^p + σ(p^2) x^{p^2} + ... = 1 + (1 + p) x^p + (1 + p + p^2) x^{p^2} + ... = product_{k=0}^\\infty (1 + x^{p^k} + x^{2 p^k} + ... ) for each prime p. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, recall that the generating function for σ(m) is related to the derivative of the logarithmic generating function for the number of divisors. But this might not help.\n\nAlternatively, think recursively. Assume that for each n, the sum S(n) = 8^{n-1}, and then relate S(n+1) to S(n). For example, notice that 8^{n} = 8*8^{n-1}, so maybe each step multiplies by 8. How does the sum S(n+1) relate to S(n)?\n\nWhen we go from n to n+1, the number of terms doubles (from 2^{n-1} to 2^{n}). Also, the arguments in the σ functions change from 2^n -2k +1 to 2^{n+1} -2k +1. Let's see if there's a way to express the new terms in terms of the old terms.\n\nFor example, split the sum for n+1 into two parts: terms where k is odd and even. Let’s set k = 2m and k = 2m-1. Then for each m from 1 to 2^{n-1}, we have two terms:\n\nFor k=2m-1: σ(2^{n+1} -2(2m-1)+1)σ(2(2m-1)-1) = σ(2^{n+1} -4m +2 +1)σ(4m -3) = σ(2^{n+1} -4m +3)σ(4m -3)\n\nFor k=2m: σ(2^{n+1} -4m +1)σ(4m -1)\n\nBut 2^{n+1} -4m +3 = 2(2^n) -4m +3 = 2(2^n -2m +1) +1. Similarly, 4m -3 = 2(2m -1) -1. Not sure if this helps.\n\nAlternatively, note that 2^{n+1} -2k +1 = 2*(2^n) -2k +1. If we write this as 2*(2^n -k) +1. Similarly, the other term is 2k -1. So each term in the sum for n+1 is σ(2*(2^n -k) +1)σ(2k -1).\n\nBut 2*(2^n -k) +1 is an odd number, and 2k -1 is also odd. Let’s denote a = 2k -1, which is odd. Then 2*(2^n -k) +1 = 2^{n+1} -2k +1 = 2^{n+1} - (a +1) +1 = 2^{n+1} -a. Wait, but a = 2k -1, so 2k = a +1, so k=(a+1)/2. Then 2^{n+1} -a = 2^{n+1} - a. But since a ranges from 1 to 2^{n+1} -1 (since k ranges to 2^n), the pairs (a, 2^{n+1} -a) where a is odd. But this is similar to the original problem but for n+1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the sum S(n) corresponds to convolution of σ functions at odd numbers summing to 2^n. The fact that the result is 8^{n-1} suggests that each step multiplies by 8. Maybe there's a multiplicative factor that arises from properties of σ on powers of 2 or something.\n\nAlternatively, consider that σ is multiplicative, so for numbers that are products of primes, but since we're dealing with odd numbers, they are not divisible by 2. However, the sum involves pairs of odd numbers adding to 2^n. Perhaps there's a relation to the Jacobi theta function or something else in number theory, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think about the generating function again. If F(x) = sum_{m odd} σ(m)x^m, then F(x)^2 = sum_{n even} c(n) x^n, where c(n) is the sum we want for n=2^k. We need to show c(2^k) =8^{k-1}.\n\nBut how to compute c(2^k}? Maybe notice that for m odd, σ(m) is the sum of divisors, which includes 1 and m. If we consider generating functions, for each odd m, σ(m) = sum_{d|m} d. So F(x) = sum_{m odd} sum_{d|m} d x^m = sum_{d odd} d sum_{k odd} x^{d k} = sum_{d odd} d x^d / (1 - x^{2d}) }.\n\nTherefore, F(x) = sum_{d odd} d x^d / (1 - x^{2d}) }.\n\nThen F(x)^2 = [sum_{d odd} d x^d / (1 - x^{2d}) ]^2. Expanding this would give terms involving x^{d1 + d2} / (1 - x^{2d1})(1 - x^{2d2}) ). Not sure how to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, use induction. Suppose that S(n) =8^{n-1}. Then for n+1, need to show S(n+1)=8 S(n}=8^n.\n\nAssume S(n)=8^{n-1}. How to express S(n+1) in terms of S(n)?\n\nLooking at the sum for S(n+1}, which is over k=1 to 2^{n} of σ(2^{n+1} -2k +1)σ(2k-1).\n\nCan we relate this to S(n} by substitution? Let’s try a substitution. Let’s set m = k for k=1 to 2^{n-1}, and m = 2^{n} - k +1 for k=2^{n-1}+1 to 2^{n}. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, split the sum into two halves. For k from 1 to 2^{n-1}, and k from 2^{n-1}+1 to 2^{n}.\n\nFor the first half, let k = m. Then the terms are σ(2^{n+1} -2m +1)σ(2m -1).\n\nFor the second half, let k =2^{n} - m +1, where m from 1 to 2^{n-1}. Then the term becomes σ(2^{n+1} -2(2^{n} -m +1) +1)σ(2(2^{n} -m +1) -1) = σ(2^{n+1} -2*2^{n} +2m -2 +1)σ(2*2^{n} -2m +2 -1) = σ(2^{n} +2m -1)σ(2^{n+1} -2m +1).\n\nWait, this seems similar to the terms from the first half. Not sure if this helps. Maybe pairing terms m and 2^{n} -m +1 gives some symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the arguments in σ for the first half are 2^{n+1} -2m +1 and 2m -1. Let’s denote a=2m -1, then 2^{n+1} -2m +1 =2^{n+1} - (a +1) +1=2^{n+1} -a. So the pair is (a, 2^{n+1} -a), both odd. So each term is σ(a)σ(2^{n+1} -a}. So the sum is over all a=1,3,5,...,2^{n+1}-1, but paired such that a + b=2^{n+1}. Wait, but the sum for S(n+1) is over k=1 to 2^{n}, which gives a=2k-1 from 1 to 2^{n+1}-1. So each a is odd from 1 to 2^{n+1}-1, and each pair (a,2^{n+1}-a) is included once. But since a ranges from 1 to 2^{n+1}-1 in steps of 2, there are 2^{n} terms, which matches the sum. Hence, S(n+1) is the sum over all pairs (a,b) with a + b=2^{n+1}, a,b odd, of σ(a)σ(b).\n\nSimilarly, S(n) is the sum over pairs (c,d) with c + d=2^n, c,d odd, of σ(c)σ(d}.\n\nNow, if we can relate the pairs (a,b) for n+1 to pairs (c,d) for n, maybe via a scaling factor. For example, if a and b are related to c and d by multiplication by 2. But since a and b are odd, multiplying by 2 would make them even. Not directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, consider that 2^{n+1} = 2*2^n. If a + b=2^{n+1}, and a,b are odd, then a and b must be of the form 2c +1 and 2^{n+1} -2c -1. Wait, but 2^{n+1} -2c -1=2(2^n -c -1)+1, which is also odd. But how does this relate to the pairs in S(n}?\n\nAlternatively, decompose a and b in terms of their binary representations. Since they are odd, they end with a 1 in binary. Maybe express a=2c +1 and b=2d +1, so 2c +1 +2d +1=2^{n+1} => c + d +1=2^n. So c + d=2^n -1. But this seems to complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, consider generating S(n+1} by considering that each pair (a,b) for n+1 can be associated with pairs (c,d) for n in some way. For example, if a=2c +1 and b=2d +1, then 2c +1 +2d +1=2^{n+1} => c +d +1=2^n => c +d=2^n -1. But this might not directly relate to S(n).\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that σ is multiplicative and apply convolution. The sum S(n) is the Dirichlet convolution of σ evaluated at odd numbers summing to 2^n. But since 2^n is a power of 2, and a and b are odd, their gcd is 1. Therefore, σ(a)σ(b)=σ(ab). But wait, σ is multiplicative, so if a and b are coprime, σ(ab)=σ(a)σ(b). But here, we have σ(a)σ(b), which equals σ(ab). But the sum S(n) is the sum over a + b=2^n, a,b odd, of σ(ab). Not sure.\n\nWait, but ab would be the product of two numbers summing to 2^n. Not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, consider that for each pair (a,b) with a + b=2^n, then ab= a(2^n -a). Maybe relate this to something, but I don't see the connection.\n\nAlternatively, look for a pattern in the multiplicative properties. For example, when n=1, S(1}=1=8^0; n=2, S(2}=8=8^1; n=3, S(3}=64=8^2. So S(n)=8^{n-1}. If we can show that each term in the sum contributes a factor of 8 when n increases by 1, then induction works. But how?\n\nSuppose that for each term in S(n}, there are eight terms in S(n+1} related to it. But how? The number of terms doubles each time, from 2^{n-1} to 2^{n}. So doubling the terms, but the value goes up by a factor of 8. So each term in S(n} contributes four times its value to S(n+1}. Not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, use mathematical induction. Assume S(k}=8^{k-1} for all k ≤n. Then show S(n+1}=8^{n}.\n\nBut how?\n\nConsider that S(n+1} = sum_{a + b=2^{n+1}, a,b odd} σ(a)σ(b).\n\nIf we can split this sum into parts where a and b are multiples of certain numbers. For example, let’s write a=2c +1 and b=2d +1. Then 2c +1 +2d +1=2^{n+1} → c +d +1=2^n → c +d=2^n -1. So the sum becomes sum_{c +d=2^n -1} σ(2c +1)σ(2d +1).\n\nBut this doesn’t immediately relate to S(n} which involves sum over c +d=2^{n-1} of σ(c)σ(d}... Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider that σ(2c +1} and σ(2d +1} can be related to σ(c) and σ(d). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, use generating functions again. Let’s suppose that F(x} = sum_{m odd} σ(m)x^m. Then F(x}^2 has coefficients c(2^n}=8^{n-1}. If we can show that F(x) satisfies a certain functional equation, like F(x)= something involving F(x^2}), then we can find a recursion.\n\nFor example, suppose F(x) = (something) + 8x^2 F(x^2}). Then squaring both sides might give us a recursion for the coefficients. Let’s test this idea.\n\nSuppose F(x) = A(x} +8x^2 F(x^2}. Then F(x}^2 = [A(x} +8x^2 F(x^2}]^2. If we can choose A(x} such that this holds, but this is vague.\n\nAlternatively, note that when n increases by 1, the power of x in the coefficient we’re interested in doubles. This suggests a relationship between F(x} and F(x^2}).\n\nAlternatively, consider the generating function F(x} satisfies F(x}^2 = sum_{n=1}^\\infty 8^{n-1} x^{2^n} } + ... other terms. But we need to isolate the coefficients at x^{2^n}.\n\nAlternatively, note that for the coefficient of x^{2^n} in F(x}^2 is 8^{n-1}, and for other even numbers not power of two, the coefficient is zero? No, that can't be, because for example, at x^6, the coefficient would be sum of σ(a)σ(b} where a +b=6, a,b odd: (1,5), (3,3), (5,1). So σ(1)σ(5)=1*6=6, σ(3)σ(3)=4*4=16, σ(5)σ(1}=6*1=6. Total=6+16+6=28, which is not zero. So the generating function F(x}^2 has non-zero coefficients at other even numbers. Therefore, the identity only holds at x^{2^n}, which complicates things.\n\nTherefore, perhaps another approach is needed. Let’s think about the multiplicative properties of σ. Since σ is multiplicative, and a and b are coprime (since a + b=2^n and both are odd), then σ(ab)=σ(a)σ(b). Therefore, the sum S(n} can be seen as sum_{a + b=2^n, a,b odd} σ(ab}.\n\nBut how does this help? Maybe relate ab to something. Note that ab =a(2^n -a). Let’s consider ab mod 2^n. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, note that the product ab is congruent to -a^2 mod 2^n, since b=2^n -a. So ab ≡ -a^2 mod 2^n. But I don't see how this helps.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the numbers a and b are such that a + b=2^n. So they are symmetric around 2^{n-1}. For example, when n=3, the pairs are (1,7), (3,5}, etc., around 4. Maybe there's a symmetry in the divisors.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the sum S(n} can be rewritten as sum_{k=1}^{2^{n-1}} σ(2k -1)σ(2^n -2k +1). Let’s make a substitution m=2^{n-1} -k +1. Let’s see:\n\nWhen k=1, m=2^{n-1} -1 +1=2^{n-1}\n\nWhen k=2^{n-1}, m=2^{n-1} -2^{n-1} +1=1\n\nSo reversing the order. Let’s substitute k=2^{n-1} -m +1. Then:\n\nσ(2k -1)=σ(2(2^{n-1} -m +1) -1)=σ(2^n -2m +2 -1)=σ(2^n -2m +1)\n\nSimilarly, σ(2^n -2k +1)=σ(2^n -2(2^{n-1} -m +1) +1)=σ(2^n -2^n +2m -2 +1)=σ(2m -1)\n\nSo the term becomes σ(2^n -2m +1)σ(2m -1), which is the same as the original term. Therefore, the sum is symmetric in the sense that reversing the order of summation gives the same terms. Hence, each pair is counted once, but since the sum is symmetric, we can consider it as sum_{a odd < 2^{n}} σ(a)σ(2^n -a) multiplied by 1, but since a ranges from 1 to 2^n -1 in steps of 2, there are 2^{n-1} terms. However, this doesn’t immediately help.\n\nAnother angle: Since σ is multiplicative, and a and b are coprime, then σ(a)σ(b)=σ(ab). So the sum S(n} becomes sum_{a + b=2^n, a,b odd} σ(ab}.\n\nBut why would the sum of σ(ab} over these pairs equal 8^{n-1}?\n\nPerhaps consider that ab is always congruent to something modulo a certain number. Or perhaps use induction with multiplicative properties.\n\nAlternatively, think about the case when n=1: ab=1*1=1, σ(1}=1. Sum=1=8^0.\n\nn=2: pairs (1,3}, (3,1}. ab=3, σ(3)=4. So sum=4+4=8=8^1.\n\nn=3: pairs (1,7}, (3,5}, (5,3}, (7,1}. ab=7,15,15,7. σ(7)=8, σ(15)=1+3+5+15=24. Sum=8+24+24+8=64=8^2.\n\nn=4: ab would be 15, 13*3=39, 11*5=55, 9*7=63, etc. σ(15)=24, σ(39)=1+3+13+39=56, σ(55}=1+5+11+55=72, σ(63}=1+3+7+9+21+63=104. Then pairs would be (1,15), (3,13), (5,11), (7,9), etc. Sum would be σ(15)+σ(39)+σ(55)+σ(63)+... multiplied by 2. For example:\n\nFor n=4, sum from k=1 to 8:\n\nk=1: σ(1)σ(15)=1*24=24\n\nk=2: σ(3)σ(13)=4*14=56\n\nk=3: σ(5)σ(11)=6*12=72\n\nk=4: σ(7)σ(9)=8*13=104\n\nk=5: σ(9)σ(7)=13*8=104\n\nk=6: σ(11)σ(5}=12*6=72\n\nk=7: σ(13)σ(3}=14*4=56\n\nk=8: σ(15)σ(1}=24*1=24\n\nSum: 24+56+72+104+104+72+56+24= (24*2)+(56*2)+(72*2)+(104*2)= 2*(24+56+72+104)=2*(256)=512=8^3. Correct.\n\nSo the pattern holds, and the sum S(n} is indeed 8^{n-1}. But to prove this generally, we need a general argument.\n\nNotice that in the examples, σ(ab} seems to contribute to the sum in a way that accumulates multiplicatively. For instance, when n increases, the number of terms doubles, and the sum multiplies by 8. This suggests that there might be a multiplicative property or a recursive relation where each term branches into new terms contributing 8 times more.\n\nAnother observation: 8 is 2^3. Since we’re dealing with powers of 2 in the sum's upper limit and in the result, perhaps there's a connection to the number of divisors or properties of exponents.\n\nAlternatively, consider that each time n increases by 1, the number of terms doubles, and each term contributes 4 times more than before. For example, from n=1 to n=2, terms go from 1 to 2 terms, each contributing 4 (1*4 and 4*1). Similarly, from n=2 to n=3, each term contributes 6 times (but no, it's 24, etc.). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, note that σ(2k -1} and σ(2^n -2k +1} might have a product that relates to powers of 2. For example, in n=2, σ(3}=4, which is 2^2. In n=3, σ(7}=8=2^3, σ(5}=6=2*3, σ(3}=4=2^2. The products are 8*1=8, 4*6=24, 6*4=24, 1*8=8. Their sum is 64=8^2. The factors of 2 and 3 suggest that primes are involved, but 8 is a power of 2.\n\nAnother approach: Since 8^{n-1} = (2^3)^{n-1} =2^{3(n-1)}. Maybe there's a combinatorial interpretation involving three binary choices per step or something, but this is vague.\n\nAlternatively, consider expanding 8^{n-1} as (7 +1)^{n-1} and use the binomial theorem, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, use induction. Assume S(n}=8^{n-1}. Now, for S(n+1}, we need to show it's 8^n.\n\nConsider that S(n+1} = sum_{k=1}^{2^{n}} σ(2^{n+1} -2k +1)σ(2k -1}.\n\nSplit this sum into two parts: terms where k ≤2^{n-1} and k >2^{n-1}.\n\nFor k ≤2^{n-1}, let’s set k =m. Then the terms are σ(2^{n+1} -2m +1)σ(2m -1}.\n\nFor k >2^{n-1}, set k=2^{n} -m +1, where m ≤2^{n-1}. Then the terms are σ(2^{n+1} -2(2^{n} -m +1) +1)σ(2(2^{n} -m +1) -1) =σ(2^{n+1} -2^{n+1} +2m -2 +1)σ(2^{n+1} -2m +2 -1) =σ(2m -1)σ(2^{n+1} -2m +1).\n\nSo the sum S(n+1} can be written as sum_{m=1}^{2^{n-1}} [σ(2^{n+1} -2m +1)σ(2m -1) + σ(2m -1)σ(2^{n+1} -2m +1)] = 2*sum_{m=1}^{2^{n-1}} σ(2^{n+1} -2m +1)σ(2m -1).\n\nWait, but this would imply S(n+1}=2*S'(n}, where S'(n} is a similar sum but with 2^{n+1} instead of 2^{n}. But S(n} is sum_{m=1}^{2^{n-1}} σ(2^{n} -2m +1)σ(2m -1}=8^{n-1}.\n\nHowever, S(n+1} is sum_{m=1}^{2^{n}} σ(2^{n+1} -2m +1)σ(2m -1}=8^{n}.\n\nBut according to the above split, S(n+1}=2*sum_{m=1}^{2^{n-1}} σ(2^{n+1} -2m +1)σ(2m -1}.\n\nBut unless the sum sum_{m=1}^{2^{n-1}} σ(2^{n+1} -2m +1)σ(2m -1} equals 4*8^{n-1}=8^{n}/2, which would make S(n+1}=8^{n}.\n\nBut why would that sum be 4*8^{n-1}?\n\nLet’s check for n=2:\n\nsum_{m=1}^{2^{1}=2} σ(2^{3} -2m +1)σ(2m -1}=σ(8-2+1)σ(1) + σ(8-4+1)σ(3}=σ(7)σ(1} + σ(5)σ(3}=8*1 +6*4=8+24=32. 4*8^{2-1}=4*8=32. Yes, works. Then S(n+1}=2*32=64=8^2.\n\nSimilarly, for n=1:\n\nsum_{m=1}^{1} σ(4-2m +1)σ(2m -1}=σ(4-2+1)σ(1}=σ(3)σ(1}=4*1=4. 4*8^{0}=4*1=4. Then S(2}=2*4=8=8^1.\n\nSo the pattern holds. Therefore, the sum sum_{m=1}^{2^{n-1}} σ(2^{n+1} -2m +1)σ(2m -1} equals 4*8^{n-1}. Hence, S(n+1}=2*4*8^{n-1}=8*8^{n-1}=8^{n}.\n\nTherefore, by induction:\n\nBase case n=1: S(1}=1=8^0.\n\nAssume S(n}=8^{n-1}. Then sum_{m=1}^{2^{n-1}} σ(2^{n+1} -2m +1)σ(2m -1}=4*8^{n-1}. Therefore, S(n+1}=2*4*8^{n-1}=8^{n}.\n\nHence, the identity holds by induction if we can show that sum_{m=1}^{2^{n-1}} σ(2^{n+1} -2m +1)σ(2m -1}=4*8^{n-1}.\n\nBut why is this sum equal to 4*8^{n-1}?\n\nLooking at the examples:\n\nFor n=2, the sum was 32=4*8=4*8^{2-1}.\n\nFor n=1, the sum was 4=4*8^{1-1}=4*1.\n\nSo perhaps this sum is always 4*8^{n-1}. How to prove this?\n\nLet’s denote this sum as T(n}=sum_{m=1}^{2^{n-1}} σ(2^{n+1} -2m +1)σ(2m -1}.\n\nWe need to show T(n}=4*8^{n-1}.\n\nBut from the examples, T(n} seems to be 4*S(n}}.\n\nFor n=1: T(1}=4*S(1}=4*1=4.\n\nFor n=2: T(2}=4*S(2}=4*8=32.\n\nWhich matches. So T(n}=4*S(n}}.\n\nBut why?\n\nLooking at T(n}:\n\nT(n}=sum_{m=1}^{2^{n-1}} σ(2^{n+1} -2m +1)σ(2m -1}.\n\nNote that 2^{n+1} -2m +1=2*(2^n) -2m +1=2*(2^n -m) +1.\n\nSo T(n}=sum_{m=1}^{2^{n-1}} σ(2*(2^n -m) +1)σ(2m -1}.\n\nBut 2*(2^n -m) +1=2^{n+1} -2m +1, which is the same as 2^{n+1} - (2m -1}).\n\nTherefore, T(n}=sum_{m=1}^{2^{n-1}} σ(2^{n+1} - (2m -1))σ(2m -1}.\n\nBut 2m -1 ranges from 1 to 2^n -1 as m goes from 1 to 2^{n-1}.\n\nSo T(n}=sum_{a=1,3,...,2^n -1} σ(2^{n+1} -a)σ(a).\n\nBut 2^{n+1} -a is also odd, since a is odd. So T(n}=sum_{a=1,3,...,2^n -1} σ(a)σ(2^{n+1} -a).\n\nBut this is similar to S(n+1}, which is sum_{a=1,3,...,2^{n+1} -1} σ(a)σ(2^{n+1} -a).\n\nHowever, T(n} is only summing over a up to 2^n -1}, whereas S(n+1} sums over a up to 2^{n+1} -1.\n\nBut note that when a >2^n, 2^{n+1} -a <2^n. So the sum T(n} is half of S(n+1}. But wait, S(n+1} is sum_{a=1}^{2^{n+1} -1} σ(a)σ(2^{n+1} -a) where a is odd. This sum has 2^{n} terms. When a ≤2^n -1, then 2^{n+1} -a ≥2^n +1, which is also odd. So the sum S(n+1} can be split into two parts: a ≤2^n -1 and a ≥2^n +1. But since a is odd, a from 2^n +1 to 2^{n+1} -1 can be written as a=2^{n+1} -b where b=2^{n+1} -a, which is ≤2^n -1. Therefore, S(n+1}= sum_{a=1}^{2^n -1} σ(a)σ(2^{n+1} -a) + sum_{b=1}^{2^n -1} σ(2^{n+1} -b)σ(b)}=2*T(n}}.\n\nBut we know S(n+1}=8^{n}, so 2*T(n}=8^{n} ⇒ T(n}=8^{n}/2=4*8^{n-1}}.\n\nHence, we have T(n}=4*8^{n-1}, which is what we needed. Therefore, the inductive step holds.\n\nThus, by mathematical induction, the identity holds for all positive integers n.",
