    "Content": "Proof .  Let $\\sum_{k = 0}^N c_k \\rightarrow s$, let $\\sigma_N = (S_0 + \\dots + S_{N-1})/N$ be the $Nth$ Cesaro sum where $S_K$ is the $Kth$ partial sum of the series.

    "AcceptedAnswer": "You don't need the fact that it's a series, which is maybe why this is confusing for you. Suppose $S_n \\to S$ is a converging sequence. Then $\\frac 1n \\sum_{k=1}^n S_k \\to S$ also. Roughly speaking, if you take $n$ large enough, then all the big terms (big index, not big in value) are close to $S$ ; all the small terms (small index) will get killed when $n$ goes to infinity. Non-roughly speaking, \n$$\n\\left| \\left( \\frac 1n \\sum_{k=1}^n S_k \\right) - S \\right| = \\frac 1n \\left| \\sum_{k=1}^n (S_k - S) \\right| \\le \\frac 1n \\sum_{k=1}^n |S_k - S| = \\frac {\\sum_{k=1}^{\\ell} |S_k - S|}{n} + \\frac {\\sum_{k=\\ell+1}^n |S_k - S|}{n}\n$$\nLet $\\varepsilon > 0$, and choose $\\ell$ such that for all $k > \\ell$, $|S_k - S| < \\varepsilon/2$ by convergence of $S_k$ to $S$. Now that $\\ell$ is fixed, choose $N$ large enough so that for all $n > N$, \n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^{\\ell} |S_k - S|}{n} < \\varepsilon / 2.\n$$\n(Note that the numerator does not depend on $n$ so we still have freedom.) It follows that for all $n > N$,\n$$\n\\frac {\\sum_{k=1}^{\\ell} |S_k - S|}{n} + \\frac {\\sum_{k=\\ell+1}^n |S_k - S|}{n} \\le \\frac {\\sum_{k=1}^{\\ell} |S_k - S|}{n} + \\frac{(n-\\ell) (\\varepsilon/2)}n  \\le \\varepsilon.\n$$\nFor your particular problem, put $S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^n c_k$.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to understand the original problem and extract the necessary information.\n\nThe title of the question is \"Convergence of series implies convergence of Cesaro Mean.\" The user is trying to prove that if a series converges to s, then its Cesaro mean also converges to s. The problem statement includes some steps they've taken, showing the expression for s - σ_N, where σ_N is the Cesaro sum. They're stuck at that point and asking for guidance on where to go next.\n\nNow, following the example provided, I need to list the assumptions one by line, each addressing a single property or condition of one object. Then, state the problem clearly.\n\nLooking at the original question, the key assumptions here are:\n\n1. The series ∑_{k=0}^N c_k converges to s as N approaches infinity.\n2. The Cesaro mean σ_N is defined as the average of the first N partial sums S_0 to S_{N-1}.\n3. The partial sum S_K is the Kth partial sum of the series.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The problem is to prove that the Cesaro mean σ_N converges to s given that the series itself converges to s. The user's attempt shows an expansion of s - σ_N, and they need to proceed from there.\n\nI need to make sure that the assumptions are correctly listed and that the problem statement is clear. Let me check again. The original problem states that convergence of the series implies convergence of the Cesaro mean. The user's work leads them to an expression involving the terms c_k multiplied by (N - k)/N or similar. The key points are the convergence of the series, the definition of Cesaro mean, and the relation between them.\n\nSo the formatted problem should include those three assumptions and then the problem statement to prove convergence of the Cesaro mean. The user's specific question about where to go from their current step is part of the original problem's details but perhaps not necessary in the structured format. The format example seems to focus on the problem's core assumptions and statement, not the user's specific progress.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should list the three assumptions and the problem statement to prove that σ_N converges to s.",
