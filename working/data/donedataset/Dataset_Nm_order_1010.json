    "Content": "Assume $(a_{n})$ is a bounded sequence such that every convergent subsequence of $(a_{n})$ converges to the same limit $a\\in \\mathbb{R}$. Show $(a_{n})$ must converge to $a$. Prove by contradiction . Prove the contrapositive: If $(a_{n})$ is a bounded sequence that doesn't converge to the number $a\\in \\mathbb{R}$, then there is some subsequence that converges to $b \\neq a$ (videlicet, not every convergent subsequence converges to a). 1. How to presage proof by contrapositive? Why not a direct proof? Suppose $(a_{n})$ is a bounded sequence that does not converge to $a$. In other words, negate [ for every $\\epsilon >0$, there is an $N\\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that, for all $n\\geq N,\\ |a_{n}-a|<\\epsilon$ ]. Pass the negation through the various quantifiers. Then this means that there is some $\\epsilon_{0}>0$ such that, for all $N\\in \\mathbb{N}$, there is an $n \\geq N$ such that $|a_{n}-a|\\geq\\epsilon_{0}$. Stated in plainer language, we're assuming that there is some $\\epsilon_{0}>0$ such that infinitely many of the $a_{n}$'s are at a distance at least $\\epsilon_{0}$ away from $a$. Now, these infinitely many $a_{n}$'s form a subsequence; call it $(a_{n_{k}})$ . Since $(a_{n})$ is bounded, the subsequence $(a_{n_{k}})$ is also bounded. Thus, by the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem, $(a_{n_{k}})$ contains a convergent subsequence $(a_{n_{k_{\\ell}}})\\rightarrow b$. Since each of the $a_{n_{k_{\\ell}}}$ is at a distance at least $\\epsilon_{0}$ from $a$, so $b\\neq a$. Ergo, not every convergent subsequence of $(a_{n})$ converges to $a. \\square $ 2. I understand the steps of the proof, but not the modus operandi of the proof.\n  Question posits a convergent subsequence, so we work with $\\{a_{n_k}\\}.$ How to presage we need a convergent sub sub sequence $\\{a_{\\Large{{n_{k_l}}}}\\} $? 3. Intuition please? Figure please? I forgot I asked about this earlier, but this question betters the old one .",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "A direct proof is normally easiest when you have some obvious mechanism to go from a given hypothesis to a desired conclusion.  (E.g. consider the direct proof that the sum of two convergent sequences is convergent.) However, in the statement at hand, there is no obvious mechanism to deduce \nthat the sequence converges to $a$.   This already suggests that it might be\nworth considering a more roundabout argument, by contradiction or by the contrapositive. Also, note the hypotheses.  There are two of them: the sequence $(a_n)$ is bounded,\nand any convergent subsequence converges to $a$. When we see that the sequence is bounded, the first thing that comes to mind\nis Bolzano--Weierstrass: any bounded sequence has a convergent subsequence . But if we compare this with the second hypothesis, it's not so obviously useful: how will it help to apply Bolzano--Weierstrass to try and get $a$ as the limit, when already by hypothesis every convergent subsequence already converges to $a$? This suggests that it might be worth trying to find an argument where we get\nto apply Bolzano--Weierstrass in such a way that we get a convergent subsequence with a limit different from a ; and so obtain a contradiction.\nIn other words, combining the given hypotheses with our basic tool (Bolzano--Weierstrass), it seems that going for a proof by contrapositive/contradiction\nmight be a fruitful approach.  (Of course, we don't know for sure until we're\ndone $\\ldots$; but I'm trying to describe a thought process which would suggest\nthe approach via the contrapositive.) Contrapositive also suggests itself if we just write down what we are trying to do: We want to show that $(a_n) \\to a$. If it does, great! We're done. If not, then by definition of convergence to $a$, there is an $\\epsilon_0 > 0$ and a subsequence\n$(a_{n_k})$ of $(a_n)$ such that $|(a_{n_k}) - a| \\geq \\epsilon_0 $ for all $k$.   (Deriving this step is the content of the paragraph\nthat begins \"Suppose ... \" and finishes \"Stated in plainer language ... \",\ntogether with the first sentence of the next paragraph.) When you're trying to construct a proof, and you don't see what to do yet, it's always a good idea to write down the definition of what you're trying to prove, and its negation. \nThen you can look at them and see which one meshes better with your given\nhypotheses. Here, as I said, there's no obvious mechanism to directly derive that \n$(a_n) \\to a$.  But if we assume the negation, by its very definition it gives us a subsequence, and we can apply Bolzano--Weierstrass to this \nsubsequence.  (You might ask why we don't apply Bolzano--Weierstrass \ndirectly to our original sequence.  But as I already wrote above, this won't\ngive anything.  But our subsequence $(a_{n_k})$ can't converge to $a$ --- it always stays a positive distance $\\epsilon_0$ away from $a$.  So now we can\nget some mileage from Bolzano--Weierstrass.) As to why we get a sub-sub-sequence, that just comes up naturally when\nwe apply Bolzano--Weierstrass (which produces a subsequence) to the\nnegation of the statement that $(a_n) \\to a$ (which already prodced a\nsubsequence). You shouldn't focus too much on the iterated sub's!  Instead, think\nin terms of procedures: first we applied the negation of the statement\nto be proved (and that gave us a subsequence), then we applied Bolzano--Weierstrass (and that gave us a subsubsequence). You may want to look at some of Timothy Gower's posts on proofs in real analysis.  (My discussion here is to quite a large extent inspired by his\nview-point.  The link is to a fairly recent post, but he has some earlier posts\ntoo; see here for some.  In particular, I like this one .  With some googling you should be able to\nfind more, I think; he is very interested in theorem-proving as a process,\nand has written a lot about it in a way that might help you.)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about proving that a bounded sequence converges to a limit 'a' if every convergent subsequence of it also converges to 'a'. The user wants the problem formatted with assumptions listed line by line and the problem statement.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions from the problem. The problem mentions that (a_n) is a bounded sequence. That's one assumption. Next, it states that every convergent subsequence of (a_n) converges to the same limit 'a'. That's another assumption. The problem asks to show that (a_n) must converge to 'a' using contradiction or contrapositive. However, the user's example shows that sometimes the assumptions might include conditions from the original problem, not just the ones added for the proof method. Wait, in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer, but the user added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, no, looking back, the example's original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the original problem, the user didn't specify n being divisible by 7. That might have been a mistake. Wait, no, the original problem in the example says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption in the formatted problem should just be \"n is an integer\". But the example's formatted problem has \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Hmm, maybe that's incorrect. Wait, perhaps the example is wrong. Let me check again. The original problem in the example states \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n)... is divisible by 91.\" So the assumption should only be that n is an integer. But in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\", which is not part of the original problem. That seems like a mistake. But maybe the user intended to have the problem where n is divisible by 7? Wait, no, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the answer should not include \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Hmm, perhaps the example is incorrect. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instructions for the current problem.\n\nThe current problem is about a bounded sequence (a_n) where every convergent subsequence converges to 'a'. The goal is to show (a_n) converges to 'a' using contrapositive. The problem mentions to assume (a_n) is bounded and does not converge to 'a', then construct a subsequence converging to some b ≠ a.\n\nSo the assumptions here are:\n\n1. (a_n) is a bounded sequence.\n2. Every convergent subsequence of (a_n) converges to a ∈ ℝ.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement as given, the user wants to structure the problem as per the example. The example lists assumptions from the problem. In the original problem here, the problem is to show that if a bounded sequence has all its convergent subsequences converging to 'a', then the sequence itself converges to 'a'. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- (a_n) is a bounded sequence.\n- Every convergent subsequence of (a_n) converges to a ∈ ℝ.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that under these assumptions, (a_n) converges to 'a'. However, the user's example included both the problem's given assumptions and possibly added ones from the proof method. Wait, no, the example's original problem had a general statement for all integers n, but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't there. That seems like a mistake. Maybe the user made a typo in the example. But regardless, for the current problem, the assumptions should be:\n\n- (a_n) is a bounded sequence.\n- Every convergent subsequence of (a_n) converges to a ∈ ℝ.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user also mentions proving by contradiction/contrapositive. However, the formatted problem in the example didn't include the proof method as an assumption. So perhaps the proof method is part of the problem's instruction but not an assumption. Therefore, the problem's assumptions are the two above.\n\nThe problem is to show that (a_n) converges to 'a'. But the user wants to structure the problem into Assumption and Problem parts.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n(a_n) is a bounded sequence,\nEvery convergent subsequence of (a_n) converges to a ∈ ℝ.\n\nProblem:\nProve that (a_n) converges to a.\n\nBut the original question also mentions \"Prove by contradiction. Prove the contrapositive...\" which might be part of the problem's instruction. However, in the example, the problem statement was just the mathematical statement to prove, not the method. So perhaps the problem statement should just be the mathematical assertion, and the method (contrapositive) is part of the solution approach, not the problem's assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption:\n(a_n) is a bounded sequence,\nEvery convergent subsequence of (a_n) converges to a ∈ ℝ.\n\nProblem:\nProve that (a_n) converges to a.\n\nBut I should check if there are more assumptions. The problem also states that the user wants to do it by contrapositive. But in the example, the method wasn't part of the problem statement. So the problem remains to prove the statement, regardless of the method. However, the original question on Math Stack Exchange includes instructions to prove by contradiction or contrapositive, but when structuring the problem, perhaps the method is not part of the problem statement. For example, the problem is just to prove the implication, and the method is part of the solution.\n\nTherefore, the answer should list the two assumptions and state the problem as proving convergence.",
