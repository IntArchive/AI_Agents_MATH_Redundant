    "Content": "Let $f$ be a continuous function on $\\mathbb{R}$ and define $$G(x)=\\int_0^{\\sin (x)}f(t) dt $$ Show that $G$ is differentiable on $\\mathbb{R}$ and compute $G'$ . This is an exercise from Elementary Analysis: The Theory of Calculus by Kenneth A. Ross . My first idea is the following. Let $x\\in \\Bbb R$ . Define $F(x):=\\displaystyle\\int_0^{x}f(t) dt $ . And prove that $G:=F\\circ \\sin$ is differentiable at $x$ using: It is clear that $\\sin(x)$ is differentiable at $x$ . So I need to proof that $F$ is differentiable at $y:=\\sin(x)$ . I was trying to prove that using: 34.3 Fundamental Theorem of Calculus II. Let $f$ be an integrable function on $[a, b] .$ For $x$ in $[a, b],$ let $$\nF(x)=\\int_{a}^{x} f(t) d t\n$$ Then $F$ is continuous on $[a, b] .$ If $f$ is continuous at $x_{0}$ in $(a, b),$ then $F$ is differentiable at $x_{0}$ and $$\nF^{\\prime}\\left(x_{0}\\right)=f\\left(x_{0}\\right)\n$$ I'm not sure if I can use this theorem. Obviously, $f$ sattisfies the conditions. But as $y=\\sin(x) \\in [-1,1]$ , I dont see how I could choose $a,b$ in theorem 34.3, such that it fits this case. It seems clear that I should choose $a:=0$ , and if $y>0$ I could choose $b:=1$ , but if $y<0$ , I can't find any $b$ such that $y\\in[a,b]$ . I wanted to know if I'm heading in the right direction, so I looked at the official solution manual. What they are doing there seems complete nonsense to me: I don't see why they are doing what they are doing. They end the proof with $G$ is continuous. Why is that result needed ? And isn't $f$ confused for (some undefined) $F$ in the beginning? As this proof didn't satisfy me, I looked further, and I found this proof: This proof seems completely solid to me. But it is much less intuitive (for me). I wouldn't have come with this proof myself. My question are: Was I heading in the right direction with my first idea ? Or is it not possible to apply theorem 34.3 in this kind of way ? Am I right that the official solution manual is complete nonsense, or am I missing something ? Is this last proof I found correct, and do you think the author of the book has this kind of proof in mind when he wrote this exercise ? Or do you think the author was expecting some other kind of proof ? Edit: For the bounty I would like to see a rigorous prove of why $G$ is differentiable on all $x\\in \\Bbb R$ using only theorems that are proven in Elementary Analysis: The Theory of Calculus by Kenneth A. Ross .",

However, with a bit of extra work, we can show that $f$ need only be continuous on $[-1,1]$. The only problem arises when computing $F'(\\pm1)$. Since $F(u)$ will only see $u\\in[-1,1]$, we only need to consider the one-sided derivative at $\\pm1$.

I am not sure why they are showing that $G$ is continuous. Since they have shown its derivative exists, it is already continuous. The handwritten proof looks okay. It is a different approach, but it is valid. You don't need the Chain Rule with that approach.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable math professor, so I need to make sure I understand the problem thoroughly and structure it properly. The task is to show that the function G(x) = integral from 0 to sin(x) of f(t) dt is differentiable on R and compute its derivative. The original question mentions using theorems from Kenneth Ross's book, specifically the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC) part II.\n\nFirst, let's parse the problem. The function f is given as continuous on R. Then G is defined as the integral from 0 to sin(x) of f(t) dt. The user wants to show G is differentiable everywhere and find G'. \n\nThe student's initial approach is to let F(x) be the integral from 0 to x of f(t) dt, then G = F ∘ sin. They want to use the chain rule here. The chain rule requires that both the outer function F and the inner function sin(x) are differentiable. Sin(x) is differentiable everywhere, that's straightforward. The issue comes with F: the FTC II says that if f is continuous at a point x0, then F is differentiable at x0 with F’(x0) = f(x0). But here, F is being composed with sin(x), so the input to F is y = sin(x), which ranges between -1 and 1. \n\nThe student is confused about how to apply FTC II here because if y is negative, then integrating from 0 to y would require considering an interval [a, b] where a > b, but in the theorem, usually, we have a ≤ x ≤ b. However, the FTC still holds if we define the integral from a to b as negative when b < a. The key point is that F is defined as the integral from 0 to x, so even if x is negative, F(x) is just the negative of the integral from x to 0. Since f is continuous everywhere, F is differentiable everywhere on R, not just on [0,1] or some interval. Wait, actually, FTC II states that if f is continuous on [a, b], then F is differentiable on (a, b) with derivative f(x). But in this case, f is continuous on all of R, so for any real number y, F is differentiable at y with F’(y) = f(y). Therefore, F is differentiable on all of R. \n\nTherefore, the student's initial approach is correct: since sin(x) is differentiable everywhere, and F is differentiable everywhere (because f is continuous on R), then by the chain rule, G = F ∘ sin is differentiable everywhere, and G’(x) = F’(sin(x)) * cos(x) = f(sin(x)) * cos(x). \n\nBut the student was confused about the intervals when y is negative. However, since f is continuous everywhere, F is differentiable at all points, including those in [-1, 1], which is the range of sin(x). Therefore, choosing a=0 and b=1 or b=-1 isn't necessary because F is differentiable on the entire real line. Hence, the chain rule applies without issues. \n\nThe official solution manual apparently ended up showing that G is continuous, but the student is confused because continuity doesn't directly address differentiability. However, perhaps the official solution was part of a longer process, or maybe there was a misstep. The alternative proof the student found might be using the Leibniz rule for differentiation under the integral sign, but since the limits of integration are from 0 to sin(x), which is a variable upper limit, the standard FTC combined with the chain rule suffices. \n\nSo, the student was on the right track. The key theorems here are the FTC II and the chain rule. Since f is continuous everywhere, F is differentiable everywhere, so composing with sin(x) (which is differentiable) gives a differentiable function. The confusion about intervals might stem from overcomplicating the application of FTC II, but since f's continuity is global, F's differentiability is also global. \n\nTherefore, the structured problem should list the assumptions clearly: f is continuous on R, G is defined as the integral from 0 to sin(x) of f(t) dt, and we need to show differentiability of G on R and compute its derivative. The user's initial approach is valid, and the official solution might have had some missteps or perhaps focused on proving continuity first as part of the process, but the main tools needed are the FTC and chain rule.",
