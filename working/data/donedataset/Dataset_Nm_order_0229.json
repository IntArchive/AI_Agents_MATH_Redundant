    "Content": "I have proved in earlier exercises of this book that $\\sqrt 2$ and $\\sqrt 3$ are irrational. Then, the sum of two irrational numbers is an irrational number. Thus, $\\sqrt 2 + \\sqrt 3$ is irrational. My first question is, is this reasoning correct? Secondly, the book wants me to use the fact that if $n$ is an integer that is not a perfect square, then $\\sqrt n$ is irrational. This means that $\\sqrt 6$ is irrational. How are we to use this fact? Can we reason as follows: $\\sqrt 6$ is irrational $\\Rightarrow \\sqrt{2 \\cdot 3}$ is irrational. $\\Rightarrow \\sqrt 2 \\cdot \\sqrt 3$ is irrational $\\Rightarrow \\sqrt 2$ or $\\sqrt 3$ or both are irrational. $\\Rightarrow \\sqrt 2 + \\sqrt 3$ is irrational. Is this way of reasoning correct?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If $\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}$ is rational, then so is $(\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3})^2 = 5 + 2 \\sqrt{6}$. But this is absurd since $\\sqrt{6}$ is irrational.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem correctly. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to read through the original question carefully and extract the relevant information.\n\nThe original problem is titled \"Prove that √2 + √3 is irrational.\" The user's question includes two parts: first, they ask if their initial reasoning (that the sum of two irrationals is irrational) is correct. Second, they mention that the book wants them to use the fact that if n is an integer not a perfect square, then √n is irrational, specifically pointing out √6's irrationality. They then propose another line of reasoning involving √6 and ask if that's valid.\n\nBut the task here isn't to answer the user's questions about their reasoning but to structure the problem as per the given example. The example takes the original problem, lists assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object, then states the problem.\n\nLooking at the example: The original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted version lists two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Then the problem is restated. Wait, but in the original problem, the user didn't specify that n is divisible by 7. Hmm, maybe the example had a typo or perhaps the user's original problem had more context. Wait, no, looking back, the original example problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like an error, but maybe it's part of the example. Wait, perhaps the example was structured that way to show how assumptions are listed, even if the original problem didn't specify that. Wait, perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user provided it as their own formatting. Hmm. Maybe in that example, the original problem actually had the assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the user's restatement included that as an assumption. Wait, maybe the example is illustrative, so I need to follow it even if there's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, no. Let me check again. The original problem in the example says: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that's conflicting. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Unless there was a mistake in the example. But perhaps that's part of the example to show how to filter unrelated information. Hmm, maybe the user made a mistake in their example. But regardless, I need to follow the instructions given, which are to structure the problem by listing assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo for the current problem: \"Prove that √2 + √3 is irrational.\" The user's question mentions that they have already proven √2 and √3 are irrational, and the book wants them to use the fact that if n is not a perfect square, then √n is irrational, hence √6 is irrational. The user then presents a chain of reasoning leading to the conclusion.\n\nBut when structuring the problem, we need to extract the core problem and its assumptions. The main problem is to prove that √2 + √3 is irrational. The assumptions needed for this proof would include:\n\n1. √2 is irrational.\n2. √3 is irrational.\n3. √6 is irrational (since 6 is not a perfect square).\n4. The sum or product of irrational numbers may have specific properties (but maybe that's part of the reasoning, not assumptions).\n\nWait, but the problem might not require all these as assumptions. The problem could be phrased as: Given that √n is irrational when n is not a perfect square (an assumption), use this to prove √2 + √3 is irrational. Alternatively, if the problem already assumes that √2 and √3 are irrational, then those are the assumptions.\n\nLooking at the user's original question, they mention that the book wants them to use the fact that if n is an integer not a perfect square, then √n is irrational. So the main assumption here is that for any integer n not a perfect square, √n is irrational. Specifically, since 2, 3, and 6 are not perfect squares, their square roots are irrational. So the problem's assumptions would be:\n\n- 2 is not a perfect square.\n- 3 is not a perfect square.\n- 6 is not a perfect square.\n- If n is an integer that is not a perfect square, then √n is irrational.\n\nBut each assumption should apply to one object. So each line should list a separate assumption about one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nFor any integer n, if n is not a perfect square, then √n is irrational.\n2 is an integer not a perfect square.\n3 is an integer not a perfect square.\n6 is an integer not a perfect square.\n\nProblem:\nProve that √2 + √3 is irrational.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem's key assumption is the general fact about √n being irrational when n is not a perfect square, and the specific instances for 2, 3, 6 are applications of that. But according to the example given, each assumption is listed line by line. For instance, in the example, they listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions, even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n\". So perhaps the example is breaking down all conditions, even if they are part of the problem statement.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user's problem says \"use the fact that if n is an integer not a perfect square, then √n is irrational\". Therefore, the main assumption here is that general fact, and then the problem is to use that to prove √2 + √3 is irrational. Additionally, since 2, 3, and 6 are not perfect squares, those might be separate assumptions. But maybe the problem assumes that the reader knows 2, 3, 6 are not perfect squares, so those are given facts. Alternatively, the problem might take as an assumption the general rule, and then the specific instances are applications.\n\nSo structuring this:\n\nAssumption:\nIf an integer n is not a perfect square, then √n is irrational.\n2 is not a perfect square.\n3 is not a perfect square.\n6 is not a perfect square.\n\nProblem:\nProve that √2 + √3 is irrational.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem doesn't require the 6 part, but the user's own reasoning tried to use √6's irrationality. So maybe the problem requires using the fact that √6 is irrational, which comes from 6 not being a perfect square, hence the assumption. But the problem as stated is to prove √2 + √3 is irrational, and the book wants the user to use the fact about √n for non-square n. So the key assumption is the general rule, and the specific instances of 2, 3, and 6 not being perfect squares.\n\nBut each assumption line should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nFor any integer n, if n is not a perfect square, then √n is irrational.\n2 is an integer.\n3 is an integer.\n6 is an integer.\n2 is not a perfect square.\n3 is not a perfect square.\n6 is not a perfect square.\n\nBut that's getting too detailed. However, according to the example, even obvious assumptions are listed. In the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", and the formatted assumption lists \"n is an integer\". Then there's an additional assumption that \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, this suggests that the example might have an error, but perhaps the user intended to demonstrate that even if the problem states \"for every integer n\", the formatted version includes \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. Then, perhaps another assumption is added (maybe incorrectly). But regardless, I need to follow the instruction: list all assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo, for the current problem:\n\nThe problem is to prove that √2 + √3 is irrational, using the fact that if n is an integer not a perfect square, then √n is irrational.\n\nThus, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. For any integer n, if n is not a perfect square, then √n is irrational.\n2. 2 is an integer not a perfect square.\n3. 3 is an integer not a perfect square.\n4. 6 is an integer not a perfect square.\n\nBut perhaps the problem doesn't explicitly need 6, but the user's reasoning involves √6. However, the core problem is to prove √2 + √3 is irrational, using the given fact about √n. The fact that √6 is irrational might be a step in the proof, but the main assumptions would be the general rule and the non-square status of 2 and 3. But the user's own reasoning brings in √6, so maybe the problem expects using that. Therefore, including 6's non-square status as an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem only requires the general rule and the non-square status of 2 and 3, and 6 is derived from 2 and 3. But since the user's question mentions that the book wants them to use the fact that √6 is irrational, which comes from 6 not being a perfect square, then perhaps 6's status is an assumption.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nFor any integer n, if n is not a perfect square, then √n is irrational.\n2 is not a perfect square.\n3 is not a perfect square.\n6 is not a perfect square.\nProblem:\nProve that √2 + √3 is irrational.\n\nBut maybe 6's status is redundant because 6's status as a non-square can be inferred from 2 and 3 being primes, but since the problem statement wants to use the given fact about √n, we need to list each required non-square. Alternatively, maybe only the general rule is the assumption, and the specific numbers (2,3,6) are part of the problem's application. But according to the example, even if the problem says \"for every integer n\", they list \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. Therefore, each specific instance should be listed.\n\nWait, the example's original problem states \"for every integer n\", which in the formatted assumptions becomes \"n is an integer\". Then another assumption \"n is divisible by 7\" is added. That seems to be modifying the problem, but maybe the example is incorrect. However, since the user provided that example, I have to follow their structure.\n\nTherefore, for the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. For any integer n, if n is not a perfect square, then √n is irrational.\n2. 2 is not a perfect square.\n3. 3 is not a perfect square.\n4. 6 is not a perfect square.\n\nProblem: Prove that √2 + √3 is irrational.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem only needs the general rule and the specific numbers. Let me check a standard proof. The standard proof for √2 + √3 being irrational is to assume it's rational, then square both sides to get 2 + 2√6 + 3 = (rational)^2, leading to √6 being rational, which contradicts √6 being irrational. Thus, the key step is using the irrationality of √6, which comes from 6 not being a perfect square. Therefore, the critical assumptions are:\n\n- The general rule that if n is not a perfect square, √n is irrational.\n- 6 is not a perfect square.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user mentions that the book wants them to use the fact that √6 is irrational. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n1. If n is an integer not a perfect square, then √n is irrational.\n2. 6 is an integer not a perfect square.\n\nBut the user's question also mentions that they've previously proven √2 and √3 are irrational, which might be separate assumptions. However, in the problem as presented, the book wants to use the general fact about √n, so maybe we don't need to list the irrationality of √2 and √3 as assumptions, since they follow from the general rule and 2,3 being non-squares. But in the example, the assumptions included both the general and the specific.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might require using the irrationality of √2, √3, and √6, each derived from the general rule. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. For any integer n, if n is not a perfect square, then √n is irrational.\n2. 2 is an integer not a perfect square.\n3. 3 is an integer not a perfect square.\n4. 6 is an integer not a perfect square.\n\nProblem: Prove that √2 + √3 is irrational.\n\nBut perhaps the problem doesn't need to list 2,3,6 as separate assumptions since they are integers by definition. But according to the example, even if the problem says \"for every integer n\", the assumption is listed as \"n is an integer\". So perhaps we should list:\n\nAssumption:\nFor any integer n, if n is not a perfect square, then √n is irrational.\n2 is an integer.\n3 is an integer.\n6 is an integer.\n2 is not a perfect square.\n3 is not a perfect square.\n6 is not a perfect square.\n\nProblem:\nProve that √2 + √3 is irrational.\n\nBut this seems redundant. However, following the example's structure, which breaks down each condition into separate lines, I should list each property for each object. For example, in the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are separate lines. So here, for each number (2,3,6), list that they are integers and not perfect squares. But 2,3,6 are given as integers in the problem's context, so maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nFor any integer n, if n is not a perfect square, then √n is irrational.\n2 is not a perfect square.\n3 is not a perfect square.\n6 is not a perfect square.\n\nProblem:\nProve that √2 + √3 is irrational.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is just to use the general fact about √n, then maybe the only assumption is the general rule, and the rest are part of the problem's application. But given the user's example, where specific conditions on n are listed, I think listing each necessary non-square as a separate assumption is appropriate.",
