    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the required format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions from the original question. The user mentioned a sequence of functions f_n with certain properties and a limit function f. Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nThe original problem states that each f_n is continuous and bijective from R to R. Also, their inverses f_n^{-1} are continuous. So, each f_n is a homeomorphism since they're continuous, bijective, and have continuous inverses. That's one assumption per line: each f_n is continuous, each f_n is bijective, and each f_n^{-1} is continuous.\n\nNext, the problem assumes that the limit function f(x) = lim_{n→∞} f_n(x) is continuous, bijective, and its inverse f^{-1} is also continuous. So similarly, these are separate assumptions about f: f is continuous, f is bijective, and f^{-1} is continuous.\n\nThe problem then asks whether f^{-1}(x) is the limit of f_n^{-1}(x) as n approaches infinity. The user wants to prove or disprove this statement. So the problem part is about the convergence of the inverses to the inverse of the limit function.\n\nI need to list each assumption line by line, ensuring each addresses one property applied to one object. Let me check:\n\nFor f_n: each is continuous, bijective, and their inverses are continuous. So three separate assumptions.\n\nFor f: continuous, bijective, inverse is continuous. Three more assumptions.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- For each n, f_n is continuous.\n- For each n, f_n is bijective.\n- For each n, f_n^{-1} is continuous.\n- f is continuous.\n- f is bijective.\n- f^{-1} is continuous.\n\nThen the problem is to prove or disprove that f^{-1}(x) is the limit of f_n^{-1}(x).\n\nI should make sure there are no other hidden assumptions. The original question doesn't mention anything about uniform convergence or specific modes of convergence, just pointwise convergence of f_n to f. Also, the functions are defined on R, but that's part of the problem statement rather than an assumption. Wait, the domain and codomain are R for all functions, so maybe that's another assumption. Let me check the original question again: \"functions f_n: R → R\" so yes, each f_n maps R to R, same for their inverses. Similarly, f is from R to R. But in the example provided earlier, the assumption about n being an integer and divisible by 7 were listed. So perhaps the domain is considered an assumption here?\n\nHmm, the example given by the user included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So perhaps in this case, the fact that f_n and f are functions from R to R should be considered as assumptions. Wait, the original problem states that f_n: R→R and f: R→R. So these are part of the problem setup. However, in the example provided, the domain wasn't listed as an assumption, but perhaps because the original problem stated it in the problem statement. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was about an integer n, so the assumption listed was \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". The problem was to prove divisibility by 91. So the domain (integers) was considered an assumption. Similarly, in this problem, the functions are defined from R to R, so maybe each function's domain and codomain should be listed as assumptions. For example:\n\n- For each n, f_n: R → R.\n- For each n, f_n^{-1}: R → R.\n- f: R → R.\n- f^{-1}: R → R.\n\nBut the original problem says \"continuous and bijective functions f_n: R→R\" and \"their inverses f_n^{-1}: R→R are continuous as well\". So the domain and codomain are part of their definitions. Therefore, these should be included as separate assumptions. However, the example didn't list the domain unless it was part of the conditions. Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is that n is an integer, which is part of the variable's property. Here, the functions are defined on R, so maybe \"For each n, f_n is a function from R to R\" is an assumption. But since the problem statement already specifies that, perhaps it's redundant. However, according to the example, the user included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So following that pattern, perhaps the domain and codomain here should be considered as assumptions.\n\nBut let's see: in the example, the problem was about integers, so \"n is an integer\" is an assumption. Here, the problem is about functions from R to R, so maybe \"f_n is a function from R to R\" for each n is an assumption, same for their inverses and f and f^{-1}. But perhaps the continuity and bijectivity are the main assumptions, while the domain is part of the function's definition. However, the example shows that even the domain (integer n) was listed as an assumption. So maybe to follow the example's style, we should list:\n\n- For each n, f_n: R → R.\n- For each n, f_n is continuous.\n- For each n, f_n is bijective.\n- For each n, f_n^{-1}: R → R.\n- For each n, f_n^{-1} is continuous.\n- f: R → R.\n- f is continuous.\n- f is bijective.\n- f^{-1}: R → R.\n- f^{-1} is continuous.\n\nBut that seems a bit too detailed. However, according to the example, each assumption is one line, addressing one property or condition applied to one object. For example, in the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are separate. So here, each property (like f_n is continuous, f_n is bijective, etc.) should be separate.\n\nBut the problem statement says \"consider a sequence of continuous and bijective functions f_n: R→R, such that their inverses f_n^{-1}: R→R are continuous as well.\" So each f_n is continuous, bijective, and their inverse is continuous. Then f is the limit, which is continuous, bijective, and has a continuous inverse.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- For each n, f_n is continuous.\n- For each n, f_n is bijective.\n- For each n, f_n^{-1} is continuous.\n- f is continuous.\n- f is bijective.\n- f^{-1} is continuous.\n\nAdditionally, the domains and codomains are part of the function definitions, but in the example, the variable's domain (integer) was listed as an assumption. So perhaps here, the fact that each f_n is a function from R to R should also be listed. But in the example, \"n is an integer\" is an assumption, but the problem statement here says \"functions f_n: R→R\". So perhaps:\n\n- For each n, f_n: R → R.\n- For each n, f_n^{-1}: R → R.\n- f: R → R.\n- f^{-1}: R → R.\n\nBut maybe that's redundant because if f_n is bijective and continuous from R to R, then its inverse is also from R to R automatically. However, to be explicit, perhaps include them. Let me check the example again. The example's original problem had \"for every integer n\", which was listed as an assumption. So here, \"f_n is a function from R to R\" is similar to \"n is an integer\", so it should be an assumption. Therefore, the full list would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- For each n, f_n is a function from R to R.\n- For each n, f_n is continuous.\n- For each n, f_n is bijective.\n- For each n, f_n^{-1} is a function from R to R.\n- For each n, f_n^{-1} is continuous.\n- f is a function from R to R.\n- f is continuous.\n- f is bijective.\n- f^{-1} is a function from R to R.\n- f^{-1} is continuous.\n\nBut that might be overkill. However, following the example's structure, where even the domain of n was listed, perhaps it's necessary. Alternatively, maybe the domains are considered part of the problem's setup and not listed as assumptions. The example's original problem was about integers n, so \"n is an integer\" was an assumption. Here, the problem is about functions from R to R, so maybe \"f_n is a function from R to R\" is an assumption. Similarly, their inverses are functions from R to R, so that's another assumption per n. Similarly for f and f^{-1}.\n\nBut I need to make sure each assumption is only one property or condition applied to one object. So for each n, f_n is a function from R to R: that's one assumption. Then f_n is continuous: another. f_n is bijective: another. Similarly, f_n^{-1} is a function from R to R: another assumption. f_n^{-1} is continuous: another. Then for f: same.\n\nBut perhaps the fact that f_n^{-1} is a function from R to R is implied by f_n being bijective and f_n: R→R. Because if f_n is bijective, its inverse is also a function from R to R. So maybe that's redundant. So perhaps we can omit those lines. Let me think: if a function f: R→R is bijective, then its inverse is also a function from R to R. So stating that f_n^{-1}: R→R is redundant because it's implied by f_n being bijective. Therefore, perhaps we don't need to include the domain and codomain of the inverses as separate assumptions. Similarly for f^{-1}.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- For each n, f_n is a continuous function from R to R.\n- For each n, f_n is bijective.\n- For each n, f_n^{-1} is continuous.\n- f is a continuous function from R to R.\n- f is bijective.\n- f^{-1} is continuous.\n\nWait, but \"f_n is a continuous function from R to R\" combines two properties: being a function from R to R and being continuous. According to the example, each assumption should address only one property. In the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are separate. So here, \"f_n is a function from R to R\" should be one assumption, and \"f_n is continuous\" another. Similarly for the others.\n\nTherefore, splitting them:\n\nAssumption:\n- For each n, f_n is a function from R to R.\n- For each n, f_n is continuous.\n- For each n, f_n is bijective.\n- For each n, f_n^{-1} is continuous.\n- f is a function from R to R.\n- f is continuous.\n- f is bijective.\n- f^{-1} is continuous.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement says \"their inverses f_n^{-1}: R→R are continuous as well\". So perhaps we need to mention that the inverse is a function from R to R. But as I thought earlier, if f_n is bijective from R to R, then its inverse is automatically a function from R to R. Therefore, maybe it's redundant, but to be safe, perhaps include it.\n\nAlternatively, the original problem states \"their inverses f_n^{-1}: R→R are continuous as well\". So the fact that the inverse is a function from R to R is part of the problem statement. Therefore, we should list:\n\n- For each n, f_n^{-1} is a function from R to R.\n- For each n, f_n^{-1} is continuous.\n\nSimilarly for f^{-1}.\n\nBut again, if f_n is bijective from R to R, then its inverse is a function from R to R automatically. So perhaps including it is redundant. However, since the problem explicitly mentions \"f_n^{-1}: R→R\", maybe we should include that as an assumption. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- For each n, f_n is a function from R to R.\n- For each n, f_n is continuous.\n- For each n, f_n is bijective.\n- For each n, f_n^{-1} is a function from R to R.\n- For each n, f_n^{-1} is continuous.\n- f is a function from R to R.\n- f is continuous.\n- f is bijective.\n- f^{-1} is a function from R to R.\n- f^{-1} is continuous.\n\nBut this seems very detailed. However, following the example strictly, each assumption should be one line, one property. In the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are two separate assumptions. So here, each of these would be separate.\n\nBut maybe the problem statement's original wording can help. The user wrote:\n\n\"consider a sequence of continuous and bijective functions $f_n:\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$, such that their inverses $f^{-1}_n:\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ are continuous as well.\"\n\nSo here, each f_n is a function from R to R, continuous, bijective, and their inverses are functions from R to R and continuous. Therefore, each of these should be separate assumptions.\n\nSimilarly for f: \"the function $f(x):=\\lim\\limits_{n\\rightarrow \\infty}f_n(x)$ is continuous, bijective and his inverse $f^{-1}$ is continuous.\"\n\nSo f is a function from R to R (since f_n are and the limit is pointwise), continuous, bijective, and its inverse is continuous (and hence also a function from R to R).\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- For each n, f_n is a function from R to R.\n- For each n, f_n is continuous.\n- For each n, f_n is bijective.\n- For each n, f_n^{-1} is a function from R to R.\n- For each n, f_n^{-1} is continuous.\n- f is a function from R to R.\n- f is continuous.\n- f is bijective.\n- f^{-1} is a function from R to R.\n- f^{-1} is continuous.\n\nBut again, some of these might be redundant. For example, if f is bijective and from R to R, then its inverse is automatically a function from R to R. But since the problem mentions that f^{-1} is continuous, we have to include that as a separate assumption. The problem statement says \"his inverse $f^{-1}$ is continuous\", so we must list that f^{-1} is continuous.\n\nBut to adhere to the example's format, which lists each assumption line by line addressing one property, I think this detailed list is necessary. Even if some are implied, the example included \"n is an integer\" which is part of the variable's definition. So similarly, here, the functions' domains and codomains are part of the assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem should have all these assumptions listed. The problem part is to prove or disprove that f^{-1}(x) is the limit of f_n^{-1}(x).",
