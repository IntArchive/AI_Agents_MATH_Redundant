    "Content": "The arithmetic-geometric mean $^{[1]}$ $\\!^{[2]}$ of positive numbers $a$ and $b$ is denoted $\\operatorname{agm}(a,b)$ and defined as follows: \n$$\\text{Let}\\quad a_0=a,\\quad b_0=b,\\quad a_{n+1}=\\frac{a_n+b_n}2,\\quad b_{n+1}=\\sqrt{a_n b_n}.$$\n$$\\text{Then}\\quad\\operatorname{agm}(a,\\,b)=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}a_n=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}b_n.\\tag1$$\nIt can be expressed $^{[3]}$ in terms of the complete elliptic integral of the $1^{\\text{st}}$ kind $^{[4]}$ $\\!^{[5]}$ :\n$$\\operatorname{agm}(a,\\,b)=\\frac\\pi4\\cdot\\frac{a+b}{{\\bf K}\\!\\left(\\frac{a+b}{a-b}\\right)}.\\tag2$$ It appears that\n$$\\int_0^1\\frac{x^z}{\\operatorname{agm}(1,\\,x)}dx\\stackrel{\\color{gray}?}=\\frac{\\Gamma\\!\\left(\\frac z2+\\frac12\\right)}{2\\,\\Gamma\\!\\left(\\frac z2+1\\right)},\\quad\\forall z\\in\\mathbb C,\\,\\Re(z)>-1.\\tag3$$\nHow can we prove it?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "$$\\int_{0}^{+\\infty}\\frac{dt}{\\sqrt{(1+t^2)(1+x^2 t^2)}}=\\frac{\\pi}{2\\,\\text{agm}(1,x)}\\tag{1}$$\nhence\n$$ I(z)=\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{x^z}{\\text{agm}(1,x)}\\,dx = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\int_{0}^{1}\\int_{0}^{+\\infty}\\frac{x^z}{\\sqrt{1+x^2\\sinh^2(t)}}\\,dt\\,dx\\tag{2}$$\nthat can be managed through integration by parts, getting the same recurrence relation of the Euler Beta function involved in the claim. That, plus the logarithmic convexity of $I(z)$ (that follows from the integral form of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality applied to the original definition of $I(z)$) is enough to prove the given conjecture. For instance, by exchanging the order of integration we have:\n$$ I(0) = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\int_{0}^{+\\infty}\\frac{t}{\\sinh(t)}\\,dt = \\frac{4}{\\pi}\\eta(2) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\tag{3}$$\nas well as:\n$$ I(1) = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\int_{0}^{+\\infty}\\frac{\\cosh(t)-1}{\\sinh(t)^2}\\,dt = \\frac{2}{\\pi}.\\tag{4}$$ I also think that your conjecture directly follows from the Legendre differential equation for $K(k)$ and $K(k')$, coupled with $(3)$ and $(4)$. Nice catch, Vladimir!",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the original question, the user is asking about proving an integral involving the arithmetic-geometric mean (AGM). The integral is from 0 to 1 of x^z divided by agm(1, x) dx, and it's supposed to equal a ratio of Gamma functions. \n\nSo, the assumptions would be the conditions under which this equality holds. The problem statement mentions \"for all z in complex numbers with Re(z) > -1\". That seems like two separate assumptions: one about z being a complex number and another about the real part of z being greater than -1. Also, the AGM is defined here with a specific process involving sequences a_n and b_n, but since the problem is about the integral involving agm(1, x), maybe there's an assumption about the AGM's definition as given. Wait, the problem statement does reference the AGM as defined in the question, so perhaps that should be an assumption.\n\nWait, in the example provided, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in the example, the user included both as separate assumptions. Similarly, here, the problem states that the equality holds for all z in C with Re(z) > -1. So, breaking that down into two assumptions: z is a complex number, and the real part of z is greater than -1. Additionally, the AGM is defined in a certain way, but since the problem is about the integral using agm(1, x), perhaps the definition of AGM as given (via the iterative process) is part of the problem's setup, but maybe not an assumption per se. Wait, the problem statement here is to prove the integral equals the Gamma function ratio. The AGM's definition is part of the problem's context. However, the user's example included assumptions that were conditions on the variables. So maybe the AGM's definition isn't an assumption but part of the problem's background. Therefore, the key assumptions here are about z: z is a complex number, and Re(z) > -1. \n\nLet me check the original problem again. The user wrote: \"It appears that [integral] = [Gamma function ratio], for all z in C, Re(z) > -1. How can we prove it?\" So the conditions on z are the assumptions. The problem is to prove the equality given those conditions. The AGM's definition is part of the problem's context, not an assumption. So the assumptions would be:\n\n1. z is a complex number.\n2. The real part of z is greater than -1.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that the integral equals the Gamma ratio.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have those two assumptions listed, and the problem statement as given. Let me confirm with the example. In the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the user added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption is \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, that seems like a mistake. Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, the assumptions are \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, that would mean the problem is to prove A(n) divisible by 91 under the assumption that n is divisible by 7. But the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so maybe there was an error in the example. However, perhaps the user made a mistake, but regardless, the task here is to follow the example's structure. So in this current problem, the original question states the equality holds \"for all z in C, Re(z) > -1\". Therefore, the assumptions would be z is in C and Re(z) > -1. So two separate assumptions. The AGM's definition is part of the problem's setup, not an assumption. Therefore, the answer should list those two assumptions and then the problem statement.",
