    "AcceptedAnswer": "I will follow @user15302's idea. In this answer , I showed that $$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{dx}{(a + \\cosh x)^{s}} \\, dx = \\frac{1}{(a+1)^{s}} \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{v^{s-1}}{\\sqrt{(1-v)(1-bv)}} \\, dv, $$ where $b = \\frac{a-1}{a+1}$. Now let $I$ denote the Vladimir's integral and set $s = \\frac{1}{4}$ and $a = 7$. Then we have $b = \\frac{3}{4}$ and $$ I = 2^{-3/4} \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{1}{v^{3/4}\\sqrt{(1-v)(1-\\frac{3}{4}v)}} \\, dv. $$ The reason why the case $b = \\frac{3}{4}$ is special is that, if we plug $v = \\operatorname{sech}^2 t$ then we can utilize the triple angle formula to get the following surprisingly neat integral $$ I = 2^{5/4} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\cosh t}{\\sqrt{\\cosh 3t}} \\, dt. $$ Now using the substitution $x = e^{-6t}$, we easily find that $$ I = \\frac{1}{3 \\sqrt[4]{2}} \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{x^{-11/12} + u^{-7/12}}{\\sqrt{1+x}} \\, dx = \\frac{1}{3 \\sqrt[4]{2}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{dx}{x^{11/12}\\sqrt{1+x}}. $$ The last integral can be easily calculated by the following formula $$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^{a-1}}{(1+x)^{a+b}} \\, dx = \\beta(a, b) = \\frac{\\Gamma(a)\\Gamma(b)}{\\Gamma(a+b)}. $$ Therefore we obtain the following closed form $$ I = \\frac{\\Gamma(\\frac{1}{12})\\Gamma(\\frac{5}{12})}{3 \\sqrt[4]{2}\\sqrt{\\pi}}. $$ In order to verify that this is exactly the same as Vladimir's result, We utilize the Legendre multiplication formula and the reflection formula to find that $$ \\Gamma(\\tfrac{1}{12})\\Gamma(\\tfrac{5}{12})\n= \\frac{\\Gamma(\\tfrac{1}{12})\\Gamma(\\tfrac{5}{12})\\Gamma(\\tfrac{9}{12})}{\\Gamma(\\tfrac{3}{4})}\n= \\frac{2 \\pi \\cdot 3^{1/4} \\Gamma(\\frac{1}{4})}{\\Gamma(\\tfrac{3}{4})}\n= 2^{1/2} 3^{1/4} \\Gamma(\\tfrac{1}{4})^2. $$ This completes the proof.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem from Math Stack Exchange. The user is asking about an integral involving a fourth root of (7 + cosh x) and whether there are other integers besides 7 and 1 that give a nice closed form. But first, I need to structure the problem as per the given format.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are specific conditions or properties applied to one object each. The original problem here is to prove the conjectured identity for the integral, which equals a specific expression involving the gamma function. The question also asks about other integers under the radical.\n\nFirst, the main problem is to prove the integral equals the given gamma function expression. The assumptions here would be the integral's limits (from 0 to infinity), the integrand being 1 over the fourth root of (7 + cosh x), and that the equality holds numerically with high precision. However, the user mentions \"other integers under the radical except 7 and 1,\" so maybe there's an assumption that 7 and 1 are part of the original expression. Wait, in the integrand, it's 7 + cosh x. The user might be considering if replacing 7 with other integers still gives a closed form. But in the problem statement, the integral specifically has 7, so perhaps the assumption is that 7 is the integer in the radical expression. However, the user's question adds another part about other integers. \n\nBut according to the format, the \"Assumption\" section should list the problem's conditions. The problem as stated in the title and the question is to prove the integral equals that expression. The assumptions would include the integral's limits, the integrand's form (with 7 under the fourth root), and the conjectured closed-form expression. The second part of the user's question is an additional inquiry, not part of the original problem's assumptions. Since the task is to structure the problem, the additional question about other integers is part of the \"Problem\" section but not an assumption. \n\nSo, the Assumptions should be:\n- The integral is from 0 to infinity.\n- The integrand is 1 divided by the fourth root of (7 + cosh x).\n- The equality holds numerically with high precision (though this might be part of the problem statement rather than an assumption; maybe not needed as an assumption since the problem is to prove it, so the assumption might just be the integral's structure).\n\nWait, the example given in the initial prompt had assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So for the integral problem, the assumptions would be about the integral's structure. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nOriginal problem statement:\nIntegral ${\\large\\int}_0^\\infty\\frac{dx}{\\sqrt[4]{7+\\cosh x}}$\nQuestion: How to prove the following conjectured identity?\n$$\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{dx}{\\sqrt[4]{7+\\cosh x}}\\stackrel{\\color{#a0a0a0}?}=\\frac{\\sqrt[4]6}{3\\sqrt\\pi}\\Gamma^2\\big(\\tfrac14\\big)\\tag1$$\nIt holds numerically with precision of at least $1000$ decimal digits. Are there any other integers under the radical except $7$ and $1$ that result in a nice closed form?\n\nSo, to structure this as per the format:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The integral is from 0 to ∞.\n- The integrand is 1 / (7 + cosh x)^{1/4}.\n- The conjectured closed-form is given as (sqrt[4]{6})/(3 sqrt{pi}) [Gamma(1/4)]^2.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to prove the identity, so the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. The problem itself is to prove that equality and answer if other integers work. However, the example structured the problem by separating the assumptions (like n is integer, n divisible by 7) from the problem statement. Here, the integral's limits and the form of the integrand are part of the problem's setup, hence should be listed as assumptions. The conjectured equality is the problem to prove. The second question about other integers is part of the problem statement as well.\n\nSo, the assumptions would be:\n- The variable of integration is x.\n- The integral is evaluated from 0 to ∞.\n- The integrand is 1 divided by the fourth root of (7 + cosh x).\n\nThe problem is to prove the conjectured identity and answer if there are other integers besides 7 and 1 under the radical that yield a nice closed form.\n\nBut wait, in the original example, the user had \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" with assumptions on n. Here, the main problem is to prove the integral equals the gamma expression, and the other part is a separate question. Should both be included in the problem section?\n\nYes, the user wrote: \"How to prove the following conjectured identity? ... Are there any other integers under the radical except 7 and 1 that result in a nice closed form?\" So the problem includes both proving the identity and addressing the other integers. However, in the example, the formatted problem only included the main problem. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem had \"Prove that for every integer n... divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem's assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" (which was part of the original problem's conditions). Wait, the original problem didn't state that n must be divisible by 7; maybe the user added that in the formatted problem's assumption. Wait, the original problem was to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example had a mistake. Let me check.\n\nOriginal problem in example:\n\"Prove that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\"\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Maybe the example was wrong. But the user provided it, so perhaps the instructions are to list all assumptions from the problem. If the original problem says \"for every integer n\", then the assumption is that n is an integer. But the formatted version added \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original problem. So perhaps there's an error there. Maybe the example is illustrative but not accurate. \n\nBut given that, perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions are the integral from 0 to infty, the integrand is as given, and the problem is to prove the equality and answer about other integers. But according to the format, the problem section should be concise. So perhaps the problem is to prove the integral equals the gamma expression, and the second question is additional. But since the user includes both in the problem statement, perhaps both are part of the problem.\n\nThus, structuring:\n\nAssumption:\n- The integral is taken from 0 to ∞.\n- The integrand is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[4]{7 + \\cosh x}}$.\n- The conjectured identity is numerically verified with high precision.\n\nBut wait, the high precision is part of the problem's given information, not an assumption. The assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n- The integral is over the interval [0, ∞).\n- The integrand is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[4]{7 + \\cosh x}}$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the integral equals $\\frac{\\sqrt[4]{6}}{3\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\Gamma^2\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)$ and determine if there are other integers besides 7 and 1 under the radical that yield a closed-form expression.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user wrote \"Are there any other integers under the radical except $7$ and $1$ that result in a nice closed form?\" Where does the 1 come from? Looking back, the integrand is $\\sqrt[4]{7 + \\cosh x}$, so maybe if the expression inside the radical were 1 + cosh x, but the original problem doesn't mention that. The user is asking if replacing 7 with other integers would work. But in the problem as stated, the 7 is part of the integrand. So maybe the 1 comes from another term? Or perhaps the user considers that the general form is (k + cosh x)^{1/4}, and when k=1, there's also a closed form. The problem mentions \"except 7 and 1\", so perhaps there's an existing case where k=1 gives a closed form. Thus, the user is asking if there are other k integers besides 7 and 1.\n\nTherefore, the problem has two parts: prove the given integral equals the gamma expression, and determine if other integers (k) besides 7 and 1 exist such that the integral with k + cosh x under the radical has a nice closed form.\n\nSo, structuring:\n\nAssumption:\n- The integral is from 0 to ∞.\n- The integrand is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[4]{7 + \\cosh x}}$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the integral equals $\\frac{\\sqrt[4]{6}}{3\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\Gamma^2\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)$ and determine if there exist other integers besides 7 and 1 under the radical that result in a closed-form expression.\n\nBut wait, the original problem mentions \"other integers under the radical except 7 and 1\". The \"1\" might refer to a case where the integrand is (1 + cosh x)^{-1/4}, which the user is considering. Therefore, the problem includes checking if other integers k (apart from 7 and 1) lead to a closed-form integral of 1/(k + cosh x)^{1/4} from 0 to ∞.\n\nTherefore, the structured problem should include both proving the given integral and the existence of other integers. The assumptions are specific to the integral given (0 to ∞, integrand with 7 + cosh x), and the problem includes proving the equality and answering about other integers.\n\nHence, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The integral is evaluated from 0 to ∞.\n- The integrand is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[4]{7 + \\cosh x}}$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{dx}{\\sqrt[4]{7+\\cosh x}} = \\frac{\\sqrt[4]{6}}{3\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\Gamma^2\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)$$ and determine if there are other integers besides 7 and 1 under the radical that yield a nice closed form.\n\nWait, but the user's original question is two parts: proving the identity and asking about other integers. The example given in the initial prompt had only the problem statement in the \"problem\" section. However, in the example, the formatted problem's assumption included conditions that were part of the problem's hypothesis (n is integer, n divisible by 7), even though the original problem didn't state that n must be divisible by 7. This suggests that maybe in the example, there was an error, but following the user's structure, the current problem's assumptions should list each condition applied to one object.\n\nIn the integral problem, the integral's limits and the integrand's form are given, so those are assumptions. The problem is to prove the equality and answer the question about other integers. The \"assumption\" section should list the conditions given in the problem. Therefore, the answer should be structured as follows.",
