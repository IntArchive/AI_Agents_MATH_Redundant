    "Content": "I would like to prove that the two algebras $\\mathfrak{su}(2)$ and $\\mathfrak{sl}(2,\\mathbb R)$ are not isomorphic as Lie algebras. I started considering the following basis for $\\mathfrak{su}(2)$ : \\begin{equation}\n\\sigma_1=\\frac{1}{2}\n\\begin{pmatrix} \ni &0\\\\\n0 &-i\\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\quad\n\\sigma_2=\\frac{1}{2}\n\\begin{pmatrix} \n0 &i\\\\\ni &0\\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\quad\n\\sigma_3=\\frac{1}{2}\n\\begin{pmatrix} \n0 &-1\\\\\n1 &0\\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\end{equation} and for $\\mathfrak{sl}(2,\\mathbb R)$ : \\begin{equation}\nA_1=\\frac{1}{2}\n\\begin{pmatrix} \n1 &0\\\\\n0 &-1\\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\quad\nA_2=\\frac{1}{2}\n\\begin{pmatrix} \n0 &1\\\\\n0 &0\\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\quad\nA_3=\\frac{1}{2}\n\\begin{pmatrix} \n0 &0\\\\\n1 &0\\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\end{equation} It is possible to check that for  the $\\sigma$ s the following commutation relation holds: \\begin{equation}\n[\\sigma_i,\\sigma_j]=\\epsilon_{ijk}\\sigma_k.\n\\end{equation} While if we consider: \\begin{equation}\n[A_1,A_2]=A_2\n\\end{equation} Then it seems that I can't find any isomorphism between these 2 basis.\nNow I would like to generalize the argument to every basis, does anyone have any idea on how to proceed?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Looking at a general basis will not help much, I guess, but what you have done can be completed: Note that the subspace $U = \\def\\<#1>{\\left<#1\\right>}\\<A_1, A_2>$ of $\\def\\sl{\\mathfrak{sl}(2, \\mathbf R)}\\sl$ generated by $A_1$ and $A_2$ is a subalgebra, as $[A_1, A_2] = A_2 \\in U$. So $\\sl$ has a two-dimensional subalgebra. We will prove that $\\def\\su{\\mathfrak{su}(2,\\mathbf C)}\\su$ does not have any. Define $\\phi \\colon \\su \\to \\mathbf R^3$ by $\\phi(\\sigma_i) = e_i$, where $e_i$ denotes the $i$-th standard unit vector. Then we have \n$$ \\phi([\\sigma_i, \\sigma_j]) = \\phi(\\epsilon_{ijk}\\sigma_k)=\\epsilon_{ijk}e_k = e_i \\times e_j = \\phi(\\sigma_i) \\times \\phi(\\sigma_j) $$\nwhere $\\epsilon_{ijk}$ is the Levi-Civita symbol and $\\times$ denotes the usual cross product. Hence \n$$ \\phi([A, B]) = \\phi(A) \\times \\phi(B),\\qquad A,B \\in \\su $$\nby linearity which implies that $\\phi$ is an isomorphism of algebras of $\\su$ with $(\\mathbf R^3, \\times)$. Now let $A, B \\in \\su$ be linearly independent, then $\\phi(A)$ and $\\phi(B)$ span a two-dimensional linear subspace $V$ of $\\mathbf R^3$, hence $\\phi(A) \\times \\phi(B)$ is a non-zero vector orthogonal to $V$; that is, $\\phi([A,B]) \\not\\in V$, giving - as $\\phi$ is invertible - $[A,B]\\not\\in \\phi^{-1}[V] = \\<A,B>$. So $A, B$ do not generate a two-dimensional subalgebra. As $A$ and $B$ were arbitrary, there isn't any. Therefore $\\su$ and $\\sl$ aren't isomorphic.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that the Lie algebras 𝔰𝔲(2) and 𝔰𝔩(2,ℝ) are not isomorphic. Let me start by recalling some basic concepts about Lie algebras and their isomorphisms.\n\nFirst, I know that two Lie algebras are isomorphic if there exists a vector space isomorphism between them that preserves the Lie bracket structure. So, even if they have the same dimension, their bracket structures might differ in a way that makes them non-isomorphic.\n\nLooking at the specific algebras here: 𝔰𝔲(2) is the Lie algebra of special unitary matrices of size 2, which are skew-Hermitian with trace zero. On the other hand, 𝔰𝔩(2,ℝ) consists of all 2x2 real matrices with trace zero. Both are three-dimensional real Lie algebras.\n\nThe user provided specific bases for each algebra. For 𝔰𝔲(2), the basis elements σ₁, σ₂, σ₃ satisfy the commutation relations [σ_i, σ_j] = ε_{ijk} σ_k, which are the same as the standard commutation relations for the Lie algebra of SU(2). For 𝔰𝔩(2,ℝ), the basis A₁, A₂, A₃ have different commutation relations; for example, [A₁, A₂] = A₂. \n\nThe key point here is that the structure constants (the coefficients in the commutation relations) are different. But to show they're not isomorphic, we need an invariant that distinguishes them. One approach is to look at properties preserved under isomorphism. Possible invariants include the Killing form, the existence of certain ideals, or properties like being compact or split.\n\nThe Killing form is a symmetric bilinear form defined by the trace of the adjoint representation. For 𝔰𝔲(2), the Killing form is negative-definite because it's a compact Lie algebra. For 𝔰𝔩(2,ℝ), the Killing form is indefinite. Since the Killing form's signature is an invariant under isomorphism, this would imply they can't be isomorphic.\n\nAlternatively, 𝔰𝔲(2) is a compact Lie algebra, while 𝔰𝔩(2,ℝ) is non-compact. Compactness is preserved under isomorphism, so that's another way to see they can't be isomorphic.\n\nThe user mentioned trying to find a basis where the structure constants match but couldn't. To generalize, we need to argue that no matter what bases you choose, the essential structure (like Killing form signature) remains different. Therefore, regardless of the basis chosen, the underlying algebraic structures prevent an isomorphism.\n\nSo, structuring the problem according to the required format, the assumptions should capture the key properties of each Lie algebra, and the problem is to show non-isomorphism. However, looking at the example provided, the assumptions in the example listed specific conditions on the integer n. But in this case, the original problem states the two algebras and their definitions. The user is asking to prove non-isomorphism, so the assumptions would be the definitions of each algebra.\n\nBut the example's assumptions listed specific conditions (like n is integer, n divisible by 7). Translating that here, the assumptions would be the definitions of 𝔰𝔲(2) and 𝔰𝔩(2,ℝ) as Lie algebras. However, the example seems to extract conditions from the problem statement. The problem here is to prove they are not isomorphic as Lie algebras, so the assumptions would be their inherent properties. But in the example, the assumptions were about the variable n. Here, perhaps the assumptions are that we're dealing with real Lie algebras, each defined as specified (𝔰𝔲(2) as the Lie algebra of 2x2 skew-Hermitian matrices with trace zero, and 𝔰𝔩(2,ℝ) as the Lie algebra of 2x2 real matrices with trace zero), and that isomorphism is considered as Lie algebras.\n\nBut the example's format lists each assumption line by line, each addressing one property of one object. So, for this problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- 𝔰𝔲(2) is the Lie algebra of 2x2 skew-Hermitian matrices with trace zero.\n\n- 𝔰𝔩(2,ℝ) is the Lie algebra of 2x2 real matrices with trace zero.\n\n- The Lie bracket is the commutator [X, Y] = XY - YX.\n\nBut maybe the problem statement as given in the question already assumes these, so in the formatted problem, we need to list the assumptions from the problem statement. The original question starts by stating the two algebras and wanting to prove they are not isomorphic. The user provided specific bases, but the problem is to generalize to any basis. Therefore, the key assumptions here are:\n\n- 𝔰𝔲(2) and 𝔰𝔩(2,ℝ) are real Lie algebras.\n\n- The isomorphism is considered as Lie algebras over ℝ.\n\nSo, each assumption line by line. Each addresses one property. For example:\n\nAssumption:\n𝔰𝔲(2) is a real Lie algebra,\n𝔰𝔩(2,ℝ) is a real Lie algebra,\nIsomorphism is considered as Lie algebras over ℝ.\n\nProblem: Prove that 𝔰𝔲(2) is not isomorphic to 𝔰𝔩(2,ℝ).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original problem's assumptions are that the user has considered specific bases and found different commutation relations, but the problem is to generalize. However, in the example, assumptions were specific conditions (like n is integer, n divisible by 7). Here, the user is assuming the standard definitions of the Lie algebras, so the formatted problem's assumptions would be those definitions.\n\nBut the example didn't restate the entire definition but picked specific conditions. Wait, the example's original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, with n being an integer and divisible by 7. The user restated the assumptions as n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Similarly, here, perhaps the assumptions are that we have two specific Lie algebras (𝔰𝔲(2) and 𝔰𝔩(2,ℝ)) over the real numbers, and the problem is to show they are not isomorphic as Lie algebras.\n\nBut in the original question, the user starts by wanting to prove non-isomorphism and provides bases. The key points are the Lie algebras in question. So, structuring the problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- 𝔰𝔲(2) is the Lie algebra of 2x2 skew-Hermitian matrices with trace zero.\n- 𝔰𝔩(2,ℝ) is the Lie algebra of 2x2 real matrices with trace zero.\n- The Lie bracket is defined by the commutator [X, Y] = XY - YX.\n\nProblem: Prove that 𝔰𝔲(2) is not isomorphic to 𝔰𝔩(2,ℝ) as Lie algebras.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption is line by line, each addressing one property. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n𝔰𝔲(2) is a real Lie algebra,\n𝔰𝔩(2,ℝ) is a real Lie algebra,\nThe Lie bracket is defined by the commutator [X, Y] = XY - YX.\n\nBut the original problem states that the user is considering specific bases and commutation relations. However, the problem is to generalize the argument to every basis. Therefore, perhaps the key assumption is that we are dealing with real Lie algebras, and the problem is to prove non-isomorphism regardless of the chosen basis.\n\nWait, the example's assumptions were specific to the problem variables. In this case, the problem is more abstract. Maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- 𝔰𝔲(2) and 𝔰𝔩(2,ℝ) are considered as real Lie algebras.\n- Isomorphism is as Lie algebras.\n\nBut since the example didn't restate definitions unless they were part of the problem's conditions, here the problem's core is to show the two are not isomorphic. Thus, the formatted problem would have assumptions that they are real Lie algebras with their standard structures, and the problem is to prove non-isomorphism.\n\nBut in the example, the assumption was about n being integer and divisible by 7, which were conditions in the problem. Here, the problem doesn't have such variables, so the assumptions might be the inherent properties of the Lie algebras. However, since the user provided specific bases and commutation relations, perhaps those are part of the problem setup.\n\nBut the problem as stated by the user is to prove non-isomorphism between 𝔰𝔲(2) and 𝔰𝔩(2,ℝ) as Lie algebras. The user tried specific bases but wants to generalize. So, the formatted problem would capture that. The original problem's assumptions are the definitions of the two Lie algebras, so the formatted problem should list those as assumptions.\n\nBut to adhere to the example's style, each assumption is a single condition on one object. For instance:\n\nAssumption:\n𝔰𝔲(2) is a real Lie algebra,\n𝔰𝔩(2,ℝ) is a real Lie algebra,\nThe Lie bracket is defined by the commutator.\n\nProblem: Prove that 𝔰𝔲(2) is not isomorphic to 𝔰𝔩(2,ℝ) as Lie algebras.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's assumptions are the existence of the given bases with their specific commutation relations. However, the user is asking to generalize the argument beyond specific bases, so the problem is not dependent on the choice of basis. Therefore, the key assumptions are the definitions of the two Lie algebras, and the problem is to show they are not isomorphic.\n\nSo, in conclusion, following the example's structure, the assumptions should list the properties of the objects involved. Hence:\n\nAssumption:\n𝔰𝔲(2) is a real Lie algebra of 2×2 skew-Hermitian matrices with trace zero,\n𝔰𝔩(2,ℝ) is a real Lie algebra of 2×2 real matrices with trace zero,\nIsomorphism is considered as Lie algebras over ℝ.\n\nProblem: Prove that 𝔰𝔲(2) is not isomorphic to 𝔰𝔩(2,ℝ).\n\nBut since each assumption line should address only one property applied to one object, maybe split into:\n\nAssumption:\n𝔰𝔲(2) is the Lie algebra of 2×2 skew-Hermitian matrices,\n𝔰𝔲(2) consists of matrices with trace zero,\n𝔰𝔩(2,ℝ) is the Lie algebra of 2×2 real matrices,\n𝔰𝔩(2,ℝ) consists of matrices with trace zero,\nIsomorphism is considered as real Lie algebras.\n\nBut perhaps that's over-splitting. Alternatively, the example had two assumptions: n is integer, n divisible by 7. Each is a separate condition. For this problem, the key is that we have two specific Lie algebras over ℝ, and we need to show they are not isomorphic. Therefore, the assumptions are that each is a real Lie algebra with their standard definitions.\n\nBut the example didn't restate all definitions, just the specific conditions. Therefore, here, the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\n𝔰𝔲(2) is a real Lie algebra,\n𝔰𝔩(2,ℝ) is a real Lie algebra.\n\nProblem: Prove that 𝔰𝔲(2) is not isomorphic to 𝔰𝔩(2,ℝ) as Lie algebras.\n\nThis is similar to the example where assumptions were about the variable n. The original problem states the two algebras, so the formatted problem's assumptions are their existence as real Lie algebras. However, maybe more precise.\n\nAlternatively, since the user mentioned specific bases, but the problem is to generalize, perhaps the key assumption is that the Lie algebras are considered over the real numbers. But I think the main point is to capture that they are real Lie algebras, and the problem is to prove they are not isomorphic.\n\nIn the example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91, with assumptions on n. Here, the problem is about the non-isomorphism, with assumptions being the definitions of the Lie algebras. So, following the example's style, the formatted problem would list the relevant assumptions (the nature of each algebra) and then state the problem.\n\nHence, final answer:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$\\mathfrak{su}(2)$ is a real Lie algebra,\n$\\mathfrak{sl}(2, \\mathbb{R})$ is a real Lie algebra,\nAn isomorphism of Lie algebras must preserve the Lie bracket structure.\nProblem: \nProve that $\\mathfrak{su}(2)$ is not isomorphic to $\\mathfrak{sl}(2, \\mathbb{R})$ as Lie algebras.",
