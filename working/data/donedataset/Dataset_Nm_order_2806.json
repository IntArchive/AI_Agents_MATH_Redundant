    "Content": "How can I prove that the determinant function satisfying the following properties is unique: $\\det(I)=1$ where  $I$ is identity matrix, the function $\\det(A)$ is linear in the rows of the matrix and if two adjacent rows of a matrix $A$ are equal, then $\\det A=0$.\nThis is how Artin has stated the properties.I find Artin's first chapter rough going and would appreciate some help on this one.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "An alternative way is the Gaussian elimination : for a given $n\\times n$ matrix $A$ with rows $r_1,..,r_n$, the following steps are allowed to use, in order to arrive to the identity matrix or one with a zero row (by the linearity, if $A$ has a zero row, the 'Artinian determinant' has to be zero). Add a scalar multiple of a row $r_j$ to another row $r_i$, i.e.: $i\\ne j$ and\n$$r_i':= r_i+\\lambda r_j$$ Multiply a row by a nonzero scalar, i.e.: $\\lambda\\ne 0$ and\n$$r_i':=\\lambda\\cdot r_i$$ Exchange 2 rows (can also be obtained by 1. and 2.) Let's assume, we have two 'Artinian determinants': $D$ and $D'$. Using the above mentioned fact that every matrix can be transformed to the indentity or with a zero row, we will have $D=D'$, because 1. keeps both $D$ and $D'$ (why?), 2. multiplies both $D$ and $D'$ by $\\lambda$, and 3. by $-1$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given question into the specified format. The original problem is about proving the uniqueness of the determinant function that satisfies three conditions: det(I) = 1, multilinearity in the rows, and that if two adjacent rows are equal, the determinant is zero. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question and extract the assumptions. The problem mentions three properties. Each assumption should be listed line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. Let me break down the given conditions:\n\n1. The determinant of the identity matrix I is 1. So that's one assumption: det(I) = 1.\n2. The determinant function is linear in each row of the matrix. Since multilinear means linear in each row individually, this is a single property applied to the function det(A) regarding its rows.\n3. If two adjacent rows of matrix A are equal, then det(A) = 0. This is another condition, again applied to the determinant function when the matrix has equal adjacent rows.\n\nWait, the problem states that the determinant satisfies these properties and is unique. So the task is to prove uniqueness given these three properties. The user needs to structure this into Assumptions and Problem. \n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed per line, each addressing one condition. So here, each of the three properties should be separate assumptions. Let me check if each applies to one object. The first is about the identity matrix, the second about the determinant being linear in rows (so applied to the function det), and the third about when two adjacent rows are equal (applied to matrix A). \n\nWait, maybe the second and third assumptions are about the function det(A) itself. Let me rephrase:\n\nAssumption 1: det(I) = 1 where I is the identity matrix.\nAssumption 2: det(A) is linear in each row of matrix A.\nAssumption 3: If two adjacent rows of matrix A are equal, then det(A) = 0.\n\nYes, each of these is a separate property. So in the Assumption section, each line is one of these. The problem is to prove that such a determinant function is unique. \n\nI need to make sure there's no extra information. The original question mentions Artin's text and the user's difficulty, but those are filtered out. The structured problem should only include the essential assumptions and the problem statement. So the formatted problem would have three assumptions and the problem to prove uniqueness.",
