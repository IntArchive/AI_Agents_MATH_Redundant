    "Content": "If $\\bf{A}$ is a real symmetric matrix, we know that it has orthogonal eigenvectors. Now, say we want to find a unit vector $\\bf{n}$ that minimizes the form:\n$${\\bf{n}}^T{\\bf{A}}\\ {\\bf{n}}$$ \nHow can one prove that this vector is given by the eigenvector corresponding to the minimum eigenvalue of $\\bf{A}$? I have a proof of my own, but it's rather unelegant - how would you go about proving this?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $A=UDU^T$ be its eigen decomposition. Then $D$ is a diagonal matrix with all the eigenvalues as diagonal entries. Then we have\n\\begin{align}\n\\min_{n^Tn=1}~n^TAn\\\\&=\\min_{u^Tu=1}u^TDu ~~~\\{u=Un\\} \\\\\n&=\\min_{x\\in\\mathbb{S}}\\sum_{i}x_iD_{ii}~~~~~~~~~ \n\\end{align}\nwhere $$\\mathbb{S}=\\{(x_1,\\dots,x_N)\\in\\mathbb{R}^N\\mid x_i\\geq 0,~~\\sum_{i}x_i=1\\}$$\nThe last step is equivalent to\n\\begin{align}\n\\min_{x\\in\\mathbb{S}}\\sum_{i}x_iD_{ii}=\\min_{i}D_{ii}\n\\end{align}\nand also note that \n\\begin{align}\n\\max_{x\\in\\mathbb{S}}\\sum_{i}x_iD_{ii}=\\max_{i}D_{ii}\n\\end{align}",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to structure this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The question is about proving that the unit vector minimizing the quadratic form n^T A n is the eigenvector corresponding to the minimum eigenvalue of A, given that A is a real symmetric matrix.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions, each on a separate line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. The original problem mentions that A is a real symmetric matrix, which is a key assumption. Also, the problem is about finding a unit vector, so that's another condition on n. \n\nSo the assumptions should be:\n- A is a real symmetric matrix.\n- n is a unit vector.\n\nWait, the problem says \"find a unit vector n that minimizes the form\". So the vector n must have a norm of 1. That's an important condition. Also, since A is real and symmetric, we know it has orthogonal eigenvectors and real eigenvalues. But the assumptions should just state the given conditions, not the consequences. So the key assumptions here are the properties of A (real, symmetric) and the constraint on n (unit vector).\n\nThe problem then is to prove that the minimizing vector is the eigenvector corresponding to the minimum eigenvalue.\n\nLet me check the example provided. In the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But in the original problem, the user mentioned \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, that seems off. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the example, the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". Maybe that was a specific case? Hmm. Maybe the example was a mistake, but the user's instruction says to list all the assumptions of the problem. So in this case, the problem states that A is real symmetric, and n is a unit vector. Those are the two assumptions. So I need to list them each as separate points.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a real symmetric matrix,\nn is a unit vector.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the unit vector n minimizing $${\\bf{n}}^T{\\bf{A}}\\ {\\bf{n}}$$ is the eigenvector corresponding to the minimum eigenvalue of A.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"how can one prove that this vector is given by the eigenvector corresponding to the minimum eigenvalue of A\". So the problem is to show that the minimizing vector is that eigenvector. So that's the problem statement.\n\nI think that's all. The assumptions are the properties of A and the constraint on n. The problem is to prove the minimizer is the eigenvector for the minimum eigenvalue. Let me double-check if there are any other implicit assumptions. The problem mentions that A has orthogonal eigenvectors, but that's a consequence of being real symmetric, so it's not an assumption but a known property. So the only assumptions are the ones stated.",
