    "Content": "There is numerical evidence that $$I=\\int_0^1\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}\\arccos\\left(\\frac{3x^3-3x+4x^2\\sqrt{2-x^2}}{5x^2-1}\\right)\\mathrm dx=\\frac{3\\pi^2}{8}-2\\pi\\arctan\\frac12.$$ How can this be proved? Wolfram does not find an antiderivative. Here is the graph of $y=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}\\arccos\\left(\\frac{3x^3-3x+4x^2\\sqrt{2-x^2}}{5x^2-1}\\right)$ . Based on recent experience with integrals involving inverse trigonometric functions ( example ), I guess a proof may involve a lot of substitutions. But I don't have any insight on how to approach this. A search on approachzero did not turn up anything similar. Context If this can be proved, then we can answer the question Probability that the centroid of a triangle is inside its incircle , via @user170231's answer . How I found the conjectured closed form In my comment to @user170231's answer to the linked question, I note that the probability in that question is $1-\\frac{12}{\\pi^2}\\int_0^{\\pi/2}(y-x_+)dy$ , which is equivalent to $1-\\frac{12}{\\pi^2}(\\int_0^{\\pi/2}ydy-I)\\approx0.457993176$ , where $I$ is the integral in this question. Wolfram suggests that $0.457993176$ is $4-24\\left(\\frac{\\arctan(1/2)}{\\pi}\\right)$ , which implies that $I=\\frac{3\\pi^2}{8}-2\\pi\\arctan\\frac12$ .",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The starting point strategy (optional) Besides this integral, there were already two more related integrals posted here before, namely: $\\int_0^\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\arccos(2\\sin^2 x-\\cos x)dx$ and $\\int_{\\arccos(1/4)}^{\\pi/2}\\arccos\\left(\\cos x\\left(2\\sin^2x+\\sqrt{1+4\\sin^4x}\\right)\\right)$ , so it might be confusing to see a different starting point for each of them. However, all share the same target in that we want to arrive at a point where we can utilize: $$\\int_a^b \\frac{\\arctan\\left(f(x)\\frac{\\sqrt{g(x)}}{\\sqrt{h(x)}} \\right)}{p(x)\\sqrt{g(x)}\\sqrt{h(x)}}dx=\\int_a^b \\frac{1}{p(x)}\\int_0^{f(x)} \\frac{1}{h(x)+g(x)y^2}dydx$$ The most crucial thing here is to get rid of the square roots. So, those functions can mostly be anything containing polynomials, but from what I've observed, it's best to ensure that $g(x)$ and $h(x)$ have similar \"weights\" - e.g. don't keep $g(x)=a+bx^2$ and $h(x)=x(m+nx^2)$ , either add the $x$ term to $g(x)$ or remove it from $h(x)$ . It's also acceptable for one of those to simply be $1$ . Additionally, it would be great for $p(x)$ not to contain other square roots. Moreover, there are two useful ways to get from the $\\arccos$ to the $\\arctan$ form: $$\\arccos x=\\arctan\\frac{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}{x}\\ \\text{ and }  \\arccos x = 2\\arctan\\sqrt{\\frac{1-x}{1+x}} $$ So we need the $\\arccos$ argument to be acceptable before utilizing one of those two identities. Having $2\\sin^2 x-\\cos x$ is awesome since  it has no square roots so we can try to convert directly to the $\\arctan $ form (the second identity behaves nicer in this case). Note that having no square roots doesn't automatically ensure that we will obtain something nice afterwards (but it's a good indicator to try and convert the argument directly). Having $\\cos x\\left(2\\sin^2x+\\sqrt{1+4\\sin^4x}\\right)$ is horrible due to the fourth power, since we can't substitute out $\\sqrt{1+4\\sin^4 x}$ like we would do for a simpler $\\sqrt{a^2+b^2\\sin^2 x}$ . Here's where the trick with Vieta's relations comes in handy - as shown in the second linked post. In our case we don't have fourth powers, only $\\sqrt{2-x^2}$ , so we don't need the above trick. The argument however is even messier and we still need to remove the square root, or at least to isolate it. Here there were three substitutions that came to my mind: $\\sqrt{2-x^2}\\to x$ , $\\frac{\\sqrt{2-x^2}}{x}\\to x$ and the combination of $x\\to \\frac{1}{x}$ followed by the Euler substitution $\\sqrt{2x^2-1}-\\sqrt 2 x\\to x$ . Luckily, the second one worked nicely (I reversed it to keep the same bounds).

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object. Then the problem is restated clearly.\n\nLooking at the original problem here: it's an integral from 0 to 1 of a complicated expression involving arccos and square roots. The user mentions that Wolfram can't find an antiderivative, and there's numerical evidence supporting the result. The goal is to prove the integral equals (3π²/8) - 2π arctan(1/2).\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem is about an integral, so the assumptions would relate to the integrand's properties. Let's check the integrand: 1/sqrt(1 - x²) times arccos of a complicated function. The arccos function's argument is (3x³ - 3x + 4x² sqrt(2 - x²))/(5x² - 1). \n\nAssumptions here would involve the domain of integration [0,1], and the validity of the expression inside the arccos. For arccos(z), z must be in [-1,1]. So I should check if the expression inside arccos is within this range for x in [0,1]. Also, the denominator 5x² - 1 should not be zero in [0,1], which it isn't because at x=0 it's -1, x=1 it's 5 -1=4, so denominator is never zero here. But when x is in [0,1], 5x² -1 ranges from -1 to 4. Wait, but the denominator could be negative or positive. However, the argument inside arccos must be between -1 and 1. So perhaps there's an assumption that the expression inside arccos is valid (i.e., lies in [-1,1]) for all x in [0,1]. Also, sqrt(2 - x²) is valid because for x in [0,1], 2 - x² is between 1 and 2, so sqrt is real.\n\nSo possible assumptions:\n\n1. The integral is taken over x in [0,1].\n2. The argument of the arccos function, (3x³ - 3x + 4x² sqrt(2 - x²))/(5x² -1), lies in [-1,1] for all x in [0,1].\n3. The denominator 5x² -1 is not zero for x in [0,1].\n\nBut wait, the problem as stated already includes the integral from 0 to 1, so maybe the first assumption is redundant. However, according to the example, the original problem mentioned \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, the example's original problem had the user adding an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, no, the original problem in the example was to prove for every integer n, and the formatted problem included an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, but that seems incorrect. Wait, no, the original example's problem was to prove for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like maybe a mistake? Because the original problem didn't have that condition. Wait, perhaps the user made a typo in their example. Alternatively, maybe they intended to restructure a problem where the original had an extra condition. Hmm, but according to the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That's contradictory. So perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user wants me to follow their format regardless.\n\nIn any case, in the current problem, the original question states the integral from 0 to 1, so perhaps the domain [0,1] is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. But in the example, they took \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So maybe for the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The integrand is defined for all x in [0,1].\n- The argument of arccos is in [-1,1] for all x in [0,1].\n\nBut I need to check each assumption applies to one object and one property. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is over the interval [0,1].\nThe argument of the arccos function is in the domain [-1,1] for all x in [0,1].\nThe denominator 5x² -1 is non-zero for all x in [0,1].\n\nBut the denominator being non-zero is already necessary for the argument to be defined, except when the numerator is also zero. But maybe that's part of the assumptions. Alternatively, since the problem is presented as given, perhaps the only assumption needed is that the expression inside arccos is valid (i.e., within [-1,1]) over the interval, and the denominator doesn't cause division by zero. But since the problem is to prove the integral equals that expression, perhaps the main assumptions are that the integrand is valid over the interval. However, according to the user's example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", and the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. So maybe the user's example was incorrect, but following their instruction, perhaps for this problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- The integral is computed over x ∈ [0,1].\n- The argument of arccos is in [-1,1] for all x in [0,1].\n- The denominator 5x² -1 ≠ 0 for all x in [0,1].\n\nBut checking x in [0,1], 5x² -1 ranges from -1 (at x=0) to 4 (at x=1). So at x=0, denominator is -1, which is allowed as long as numerator is also zero. Let's check when x=0: numerator is 0 -0 +0 =0, so the argument is 0/-1=0, which is okay. So the argument at x=0 is 0, which is valid. At x=1, denominator is 5(1)^2 -1=4, numerator is 3(1)^3 -3(1) +4(1)^2 sqrt(2-1)= 3 -3 +4*1*1=4. So argument is 4/4=1, which is valid. For other x in (0,1), need to ensure that the expression inside arccos is between -1 and 1. So perhaps that's an assumption needed. However, since the problem states that there's numerical evidence supporting the result, it's likely that this condition holds. So the key assumptions are:\n\n1. x is in the interval [0,1].\n2. The argument of the arccos function, (3x³ -3x +4x² sqrt(2 -x²))/(5x² -1), lies within [-1,1] for all x in [0,1].\n3. The denominator 5x² -1 ≠ 0 for all x in [0,1].\n\nBut for x in [0,1], denominator is zero when 5x² -1=0 → x²=1/5 → x=1/√5 ≈0.447, which is in [0,1]. Wait, so at x=1/√5, denominator is zero. So this is a problem. But when x approaches 1/√5, what happens to the numerator? Let's compute numerator at x=1/√5:\n\n3x³ -3x +4x² sqrt(2 -x²).\n\nx=1/√5 ≈0.447.\n\n3x³ =3*(1/5√5)=3/(5√5)≈0.268\n\n-3x= -3/√5≈-1.342\n\n4x² sqrt(2 -x²)=4*(1/5)*sqrt(2 -1/5)= (4/5)*sqrt(9/5)= (4/5)*(3/√5)=12/(5√5)≈1.073\n\nAdding these together: 0.268 -1.342 +1.073≈0.268 -1.342= -1.074 +1.073≈-0.001. So numerator is approximately -0.001 when x=1/√5. So the expression approaches (-0.001)/0, which would be a problem. But maybe there's a limit here. Wait, this suggests that at x=1/√5, the argument of arccos approaches -0.001/0, which would tend to -infinity or +infinity depending on the sign of the denominator approaching zero. But since denominator approaches zero from the left (x approaching 1/√5 from below, denominator 5x² -1 is negative) and numerator approaches -0.001, so the expression approaches positive 0.001/ε as ε approaches zero from the negative side, which would be negative infinity? Wait, if denominator approaches zero from below (negative), and numerator approaches -0.001, then the argument approaches (-0.001)/(negative approaching zero) → positive infinity. Which is outside the domain of arccos. But the original problem states that there's numerical evidence for the integral. This suggests that perhaps my calculation is wrong, or maybe there's a simplification that removes this discontinuity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe at x=1/√5, the numerator is exactly zero, so the expression is 0/0, which is indeterminate, but in reality, the limit exists. Let's check exact value. Let x=1/√5.\n\nCompute numerator: 3x³ -3x +4x² sqrt(2 -x²).\n\nx=1/√5, so x²=1/5, x³=1/(5√5).\n\nNumerator:\n\n3*(1/(5√5)) -3*(1/√5) +4*(1/5)*sqrt(2 -1/5)\n\n= 3/(5√5) - 3/√5 + (4/5)*sqrt(9/5)\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n3/(5√5) - 3/√5 = (3/5√5 - 15/5√5) = (-12)/(5√5)\n\nThen the third term: (4/5)*sqrt(9/5) = (4/5)*(3/√5) =12/(5√5)\n\nSo total numerator: (-12/(5√5)) +12/(5√5) =0. So numerator is zero when denominator is zero. Therefore, the expression is 0/0 at x=1/√5, which is indeterminate. Therefore, the function has a removable discontinuity at x=1/√5. Therefore, the integrand is actually defined there by taking the limit. Therefore, the integrand is defined on [0,1] with a removable discontinuity at x=1/√5. Thus, the integral is proper.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the assumptions needed are:\n\n- The integral is over the interval [0,1].\n- The integrand is defined for all x in [0,1], with a removable discontinuity at x=1/√5.\n- The argument of arccos is in [-1,1] for all x in [0,1] except possibly at points where it is defined by continuous extension.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should be one line, one property per object. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is computed over the interval $x \\in [0,1]$.\nThe argument of the arccos function is in the domain $[-1,1]$ for all $x \\in [0,1]$.\nThe integrand has a removable discontinuity at $x = 1/\\sqrt{5}$.\nThe denominator $5x^2 - 1$ is non-zero for all $x \\in [0,1]$ except $x = 1/\\sqrt{5}$.\n\nWait, but this might be too detailed. However, the problem as stated doesn't mention these, so perhaps the assumptions should be inferred from the problem's context. Alternatively, since the problem is presented as given, maybe the only assumptions are that the integrand is valid (i.e., the argument of arccos is within [-1,1] and the denominator is non-zero except possibly at a point where the limit exists). But since the example includes an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (n divisible by 7), maybe here the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n$x$ is a real number in the interval $[0,1]$.\nThe expression $\\frac{3x^3 - 3x + 4x^2\\sqrt{2 - x^2}}{5x^2 - 1}$ is within the domain of the arccos function for all $x \\in [0,1]$.\n\nBut perhaps that's redundant because the problem states the integral is from 0 to 1, so x is in [0,1]. The example included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption even though the problem stated \"for every integer n\". So following that, the first assumption here would be:\n\nAssumption:\n$x$ is a real number in the interval $[0,1]$.\n\nThen, the second assumption could be about the argument of arccos being valid:\n\nAssumption:\nThe expression $\\frac{3x^3 - 3x + 4x^2\\sqrt{2 - x^2}}{5x^2 - 1}$ lies in $[-1,1]$ for all $x \\in [0,1]$.\n\nBut does this need to be an assumption, or is it part of the problem to verify? Since the problem states there's numerical evidence for the integral, perhaps it's safe to assume that the integrand is valid over the interval, hence this is an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem implicitly includes these conditions, and the user wants us to list them explicitly. \n\nIn the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", and the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but that's conflicting. The original problem's goal was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake in the example. But since the user provided that example, perhaps they want me to follow the structure even if the example is inconsistent.\n\nIn our current problem, the original question is to prove the integral equals the given expression. The assumptions needed are that the integrand is valid over [0,1], which includes:\n\n1. x ∈ [0,1].\n2. The argument inside arccos is ∈ [-1,1] for all x ∈ [0,1].\n3. The denominator 5x² -1 ≠ 0 except possibly at x=1/√5 where the limit exists.\n\nBut according to the user's example, each assumption is a single line, one property per object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe variable $x$ is in the interval $[0,1]$.\nThe expression $\\frac{3x^3 - 3x + 4x^2\\sqrt{2 - x^2}}{5x^2 - 1}$ is within $[-1,1]$ for all $x \\in [0,1]$.\nThe denominator $5x^2 - 1$ is non-zero for all $x \\in [0,1]$ except possibly at $x = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}$.\n\nBut I think the third assumption might be redundant because if the argument is valid, then the denominator must not cause division by zero except where the numerator is also zero, allowing for a removable discontinuity. However, since the example includes multiple assumptions, perhaps we need to list each necessary condition.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is presented as is, and the user wants to format it by listing assumptions, perhaps the main assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated over $x$ from $0$ to $1$.\nThe integrand is well-defined for all $x$ in $[0,1]$.\n\nBut to be more precise, following the example where they added an assumption not present in the original problem (n divisible by 7), perhaps here we need to list the necessary conditions that make the problem valid, even if they were implicit in the original question.\n\nSo, final assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\n$x$ is a real number in the interval $[0,1]$.\nThe argument of the arccos function, $\\frac{3x^3 - 3x + 4x^2\\sqrt{2 - x^2}}{5x^2 - 1}$, is in the domain $[-1,1]$ for all $x \\in [0,1]$.\nThe denominator $5x^2 - 1$ is non-zero for all $x \\in [0,1]$ except at $x = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}$ where the limit exists.\n\nBut maybe the last part about the denominator is too detailed. The problem might assume the integrand is defined, so perhaps it's better to omit that. However, in the example, they added an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem, which might indicate that the user wants to list conditions that are necessary for the problem to hold, even if they're not stated.\n\nBut in this case, the problem's validity relies on the integrand being defined, so the key assumptions are:\n\n1. x ∈ [0,1].\n2. The argument of arccos is in [-1,1] for all x in [0,1].\n3. The integrand is defined (i.e., denominator not zero except at x=1/√5 where the limit exists).\n\nBut since the example allowed adding assumptions not in the original problem, perhaps we need to list these. However, the problem mentions that there's numerical evidence supporting the result, which implies that these conditions hold. So, structuring the problem:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integration variable $x$ ranges from $0$ to $1$.\nFor all $x$ in $[0,1]$, the expression inside the arccos function lies within $[-1,1]$.\nThe integrand is defined for all $x$ in $[0,1]$ except possibly at a point where the limit exists.\n\nProblem:\nProve that\n$$I=\\int_0^1\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}\\arccos\\left(\\frac{3x^3-3x+4x^2\\sqrt{2-x^2}}{5x^2-1}\\right)\\mathrm dx=\\frac{3\\pi^2}{8}-2\\pi\\arctan\\frac12.$$\n\nBut I need to check the LaTeX for any errors. The original integrand has a missing closing brace in the arccos, but in the user's input, it's written correctly.
