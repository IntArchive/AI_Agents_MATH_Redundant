    "Content": "In the context of Banach spaces, the Closed Graph Theorem and the Open Mapping Theorem are equivalent.\nIt seems that usually one proves the Open Mapping Theorem using the Baire Category Theorem , and then, from this theorem, proves the Closed Graph Theorem . I was wondering about a more direct approach to the\nClosed Graph Theorem.\nWhat I want to show, possibly using the Baire Category Theorem,\nbut without the Closed Graph Theorem or any of its equivalent\ntheorems, that if $T: X \\to Y$ is not continuous, then,\nthere is a convergent sequence $x_n \\rightarrow x$ such that\n$T x_n \\rightarrow y \\neq Tx$.\nOf course, $X$ and $Y$ are Banach Spaces. Because $T$ is not bounded, I know that there is a sequence $a_n$ of\nunitary vectors such that $T a_n \\rightarrow \\infty$.\nNow, taking $b_n = \\frac{a_n}{\\|T a_n\\|}$, we have that\n$b_n \\rightarrow 0$, and $\\|T b_n\\| = 1$. I wonder, if there is a simple argument for constructing a\n$x_n \\rightarrow x$, based on $a_n$ or $b_n$, such that\n$T x_n$ is a Cauchy Sequence , but such that\n$\\|T x_n\\|$ is \"far from\" $\\|T x\\|$. Of course, $x_n$'s construction would have to use the fact that\n$X$ is complete.\nFor example, $x$ could be the limit of an absolutely convergent sequence,\npretty much in the same fashion as the construction in the proof of the\nOpen Mapping Theorem.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Zabreiko's lemma (from P. P. Zabreiko, A theorem for semiadditive functionals , Functional analysis and its applications 3 (1), 1969, 70–72) is not as well known as it deserves to be and I think it fits the bill to some extent, so let me state that result first: Lemma (Zabreiko, 1969) Let $X$ be a Banach space and let $p: X \\to [0,\\infty)$ be a seminorm. If for all absolutely convergent series $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty x_n$ in $X$ we have \n  $$\np\\left(\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty x_n\\right) \\leq \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty p(x_n) \\in [0,\\infty]\n$$\n  then $p$ is continuous. That is to say, there exists a constant $C \\geq 0$ such that $p(x) \\leq C\\|x\\|$ for all $x \\in X$. Assuming this lemma, let $T: X \\to Y$ be a discontinuous linear map between Banach spaces, consider the seminorm $p(x) = \\|Tx\\|$ and observe that there must exist an absolutely summable sequence $(x_n)_{n=0}^\\infty$ and $\\varepsilon \\gt 0$ such that\n$$\np\\left(\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty x_n\\right) \\geq \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty p(x_n) + \\varepsilon.\n$$\nSince the left hand side is finite, both $a_{N} = \\sum_{n=1}^N x_n$ and $b_N = Ta_N$ are Cauchy sequences with limits $a$ and $b$, respectively. We have  $\\|b_N\\| \\leq \\|T(a)\\| - \\varepsilon$, so $\\|T(a) - b_N\\| \\geq \\varepsilon$ for all $N$ and thus $\\|T(a) - b\\| \\geq \\varepsilon$. In other words $(a_N,T(a_N)) \\to (a,b)$ but $b \\neq T(a)$, so the graph of $T$ is not closed. Of course, I should make the disclaimer that Zabreiko's lemma is actually stronger than the usual consequences of the Baire category theorem in basic functional analysis and thus it does not answer the question as asked. As you mention in your question, as soon as the closed graph theorem is established, the inverse mapping theorem and the open mapping theorem follow easily, as I also explain in this thread . Moreover, the uniform boundedness principle is a straightforward consequence, too: Exercises: Use Zabreiko's lemma to prove: the uniform boundedness principle; Hint: set $p(x) = \\sup_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\|T_n x\\|$. the inverse mapping theorem. Hint: set $p(x) = \\|T^{-1}x\\|$. The proof of Zabreiko's lemma is very similar to the usual proof by Banach–Schauder of the open mapping theorem: Proof. Let $A_n = \\{x \\in X\\,:\\,p(x) \\leq n\\}$ and $F_n = \\overline{A_n}$. Note that $A_n$ and $F_n$ are symmetric and convex because $p$ is a seminorm. We have $X = \\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty F_n$ and Baire's theorem implies that there is $N$ such that the interior of $F_N$ is nonempty. Therefore there are $x_0 \\in X$ and $R \\gt 0$ such that $B_R(x_0) \\subset F_N$. By symmetry of $F_N$ we have $B_{R}(-x_0) = -B_{R}(x_0) \\subset F_n$, too. If $\\|x\\| \\lt R$ then $x+x_0 \\in B_{R}(x_0)$ and $x-x_0 \\in B_{R}(-x_0)$, so $x \\pm x_0 \\in F_{N}$. By convexity of $F_N$ it follows that \n$$\nx = \\frac{1}{2}(x-x_0) + \\frac{1}{2}(x+x_0) \\in F_N, \n$$\nso $B_R(0) \\subset F_N$. Our goal is to establish that \n$$\n\\begin{equation}\\tag{$\\ast$}\nB_{R}(0) \\subset A_N\n\\end{equation}\n$$\nbecause then for $x \\neq 0$ we have with $\\lambda = \\frac{R}{\\|x\\|(1+\\varepsilon)}$ that $\\lambda x \\in B_{R}(0) \\subset A_N$, so $p(\\lambda x) \\leq N$ and thus $p(x) \\leq \\frac{N(1+\\varepsilon)}{R} \\|x\\|$, as desired. Proof of $(\\ast)$. Suppose $\\|x\\| \\lt R$ and choose $r$ such that $\\|x\\| \\lt r \\lt R$. Fix $0 \\lt q \\lt 1-\\frac{r}{R}$, so $\\frac{1}{1-q} \\frac{r}{R} \\lt 1$. Then\n$y = \\frac{R}{r}x \\in B_{R}(0) \\subset F_N = \\overline{A_N}$, \nso there is $y_{0} \\in A_N$ such that $\\|y-y_0\\| \\lt qR$, \nso $q^{-1}(y-y_0) \\in B_R$. \nNow choose $y_1 \\in A_N$ \nwith $\\|q^{-1}(y-y_0) - y_1\\| \\lt q R$,\nso $\\|(y-y_0 - qy_1)\\| \\lt q^2 R$. By induction we obtain a sequence $(y_k)_{k=0}^\\infty \\subset A_N$ such that\n$$\n\\left\\| y - \\sum_{k=0}^n q^k y_k\\right\\| \\lt q^n R \\quad \\text{for all }n \\geq 0,\n$$\nhence $y = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty q^k y_k$. Observe that by construction $\\|y_n\\| \\leq R + qR$ for all $n$, so the series $y = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty q^k y_k$ is absolutely convergent. But then the countable subadditivity hypothesis on $p$ implies that\n$$\np(y) = p\\left(\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty q^k y_k\\right) \\leq \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty q^k p(y_k) \\leq \\frac{1}{1-q} N\n$$\nand thus $p(x) \\leq \\frac{r}{R} \\frac{1}{1-q} N \\lt N$ which means $x \\in A_N$, as we wanted.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is asking about a direct approach to the Closed Graph Theorem using the Baire Category Theorem without going through the Open Mapping Theorem. They want to show that if a linear operator T between Banach spaces is not continuous, then there exists a convergent sequence x_n → x such that T x_n → y ≠ T x. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that X and Y are Banach spaces. The operator T is linear but not continuous. The user mentions constructing a sequence x_n that converges to x, but T x_n doesn't converge to T x. They also mention using the Baire Category Theorem directly, not relying on the Closed Graph Theorem or its equivalents.\n\nSo the key assumptions here are that X and Y are Banach spaces (so they're complete), T is a linear operator between them, and T is not continuous (unbounded). The goal is to construct such a sequence x_n with the given properties. \n\nWait, the problem also mentions sequences a_n and b_n. The user already knows that if T is unbounded, there's a sequence of unit vectors a_n where ||T a_n|| tends to infinity. Then b_n is a normalized version of a_n such that b_n approaches 0 and ||T b_n|| = 1. They're looking to use these to construct x_n converging to some x where T x_n is Cauchy but doesn't converge to T x.\n\nBut the main assumptions would be: X is a Banach space, Y is a Banach space, T is linear, T is not continuous. The problem is to show the existence of such a sequence x_n → x with T x_n → y ≠ T x.\n\nSo, structuring this according to the required format, each assumption per line. Let me list them out:\n\nAssumption: X is a Banach space.\nAssumption: Y is a Banach space.\nAssumption: T is a linear operator from X to Y.\nAssumption: T is not continuous.\n\nProblem: Show that there exists a convergent sequence x_n → x in X such that T x_n is a Cauchy sequence in Y but T x_n → y ≠ T x.\n\nWait, the original problem statement says \"there is a convergent sequence x_n → x such that T x_n → y ≠ Tx\". So the problem is exactly that. The user wants to construct such a sequence using possibly Baire Category Theorem but without invoking Closed Graph Theorem or equivalents. So the problem as stated is to show that if T is not continuous, then such a sequence exists. So the formatted problem should capture that.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are the four listed above. The problem is to show the existence of the sequence with the given properties.",
