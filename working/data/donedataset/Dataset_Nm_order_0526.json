Please suggest ideas how to prove this conjecture. What are other points where the function $_2F_1\\left(\\frac13,\\frac13;\\frac56;z\\right)$ takes simple special values?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The conjecture is true, as are the other cases reported in the comments\nwhere $f(z) := {}_2F_1 \\left( \\frac13, \\frac13; \\frac56; z \\right)$\ntakes algebraic values for special rational values of $z$.\nThere are a few others obtained from the symmetry $z \\leftrightarrow 1-z$\n(these ${}_2F_1$ parameters correspond to a hyperbolic triangle group\nwith index $6,6,\\infty$ at $c=0,1,\\infty$, so the $z=0$ and $z=1$\nindices coincide); e.g. $f(-1/3) = 2 / 3^{2/3}$ pairs with\n$f(4/3) = 3^{-2/3} (5-\\sqrt{-3})/2$.   ($z=1/2$ pairs with itself,\nand the pair $f(-4)$ and $f(5)$ has been noted already;\nthe OP's $f(-27) = -4/7$ pairs with $f(28) = \\frac12 - \\frac3{14} \\sqrt{-3}$.)\nSomewhat more exotic are\n$$\nf\\big({-}4\\sqrt{13}\\,(4+\\sqrt{13})^3\\big) = \\frac7{13\\,U_{13}}\\\\\nf\\big({-}\\sqrt{11}\\,(U_{33})^{3/2}\\big) = \\frac{6}{11^{11/12}\\, U_{33}^{1/4}},\n$$\nwith fundamental units $U_{13}=\\frac{3+\\sqrt{13}}2,\\;U_{33}=23+4\\sqrt{33}$ and further values at algebraic conjugates and images under\n$z \\leftrightarrow 1-z$. In general, for $z<1$ the integral formula for $f(z)$ relates it with\n$$\n\\int_0^1 \\frac{dx}{ \\sqrt{1-x} \\; x^{2/3} (1-zx)^{1/3} }\n$$\nwhich is half of a \"complete real period\" for the holomorphic differential\n$dx/y$ on the curve $C_z : y^6 = (1-x)^3 x^4 (1-zx)^2$.  This curve\nhas genus $2$, but is in the special family of genus-$2$ curves\nwith an automorphism of order $3$ (multiply $y$ by a cube root of unity),\nfor which both real periods are multiples of the real period of a\nsingle elliptic curve $E_z$ (a.k.a. a complete elliptic integral).\nIn general the resulting formula doesn't simplify further, but when\n$E_z$ has CM (complex multiplication) its periods can be expressed\nin terms of gamma functions.  For $z = -27$ and the other special values\nlisted above, not only does $E_z$ have CM but the CM ring is contained in\n${\\bf Z}[\\rho]$ where $\\rho = e^{2\\pi i/3} = (-1+\\sqrt{-3})/2$.\nThen the $\\Gamma$ and $\\pi$ factors of the period of $E_z$ exactly\nmatch those in the integral formula, leaving us with\nan algebraic value of $f(z)$.  It turns out that the choice $z = -27$\nmakes $E_z$ a curve with complex multiplication by ${\\bf Z}[7\\rho]$.\nThe others from the comments lead to ${\\bf Z}[m\\rho]$ with $m=1,2,3,5$,\nand the examples where $z$ is a quadratic irrationality come from\n${\\bf Z}[13\\rho]$ and ${\\bf Z}[11\\rho]$. One way to get from $C_z$ to $E_z$ is to start from the change of variable\n$u^3 = (1+cx)/x$, which gives\n$$\nf(z) = \\int_{\\root 3 \\of {1-z}}^\\infty \\frac{3u \\, du}{\\sqrt{(u^3+z)(u^3+z-1)}}.\n$$\nand identifies $C_z$ with the hyperelliptic curve $v^2 = (u^3+z)(u^3+z-1)$.\nNow in general a curve $v^2 = u^6+Au^3+B^6$ has an involution $\\iota$ taking\n$u$ to $B^2/u$, and the quotient by $\\iota$ is an elliptic curve;\nwe compute that this curve has $j$-invariant\n$$\nj = 6912 \\frac{(5+2r)^3}{(2-r)^3(2+r)}\n$$\nwhere $A = rB^3$.  (There are two choices of $\\iota$, related by\n$v \\leftrightarrow -v$, and thus two choices of $j$, related by\n$r \\leftrightarrow -r$; but the corresponding elliptic curves\nare $3$-isogenous, so their periods are proportional.)\nIn our case $r = A/B^3 = -(2z+1)/\\sqrt{z^2+z}$ (in which the\n$z \\leftrightarrow 1-z$ symmetry takes $r$ to $-r$).  Taking $z=-27$\nyields $j = -2^{15} 3^4 5^3 (52518123 \\pm 11460394\\sqrt{21})$,\nwhich are the $j$-invariants of the ${\\bf Z}[7\\rho]$ curves;\nworking backwards from the $j$-invariants of the other\n${\\bf Z}[m\\rho]$ curves we find the additional values of $z$\nnoted in the comments and earlier in this answer.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the main problem. \n\nLooking at the original question, the user is trying to prove that the hypergeometric function $_2F_1\\left(\\frac13,\\frac13;\\frac56;-27\\right)$ equals $\\frac{4}{7}$. They also provided several integral forms and other representations which are claimed to be equivalent. \n\nThe assumptions here are about the parameters and variables in the hypergeometric function and the integrals. Each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. The problem statement is to prove the equality.\n\nSo, for the hypergeometric function part, the assumptions would include the parameters a=1/3, b=1/3, c=5/6, and the variable z=-27. For the integral forms, the limits of integration (0 to 1 for the first integral, 0 to π for another, etc.), the integrands, and the right-hand side expressions involving Gamma functions. However, since the problem is primarily about proving the hypergeometric function equality, maybe the integral forms are alternative representations but not assumptions. The problem itself is to prove that this hypergeometric function evaluated at -27 equals 4/7.\n\nWait, but the example given in the instruction had assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". In this case, the original problem doesn't state any conditions except the parameters of the hypergeometric function. The parameters a, b, c are given as 1/3, 1/3, 5/6, and z is -27. The problem is to show that this evaluates to 4/7. Since the hypergeometric function's definition requires certain conditions on the parameters (like c not being a non-positive integer), which are satisfied here, but maybe those aren't stated. However, the user hasn't mentioned any restrictions, so maybe the main assumption is just the values of a, b, c, and z.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would list each parameter and the value of z. Each line should be one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\na = 1/3,\nb = 1/3,\nc = 5/6,\nz = -27.\n\nProblem: Prove that $_2F_1\\left(\\frac13,\\frac13;\\frac56;-27\\right) = \\frac{4}{7}$.\n\nThe other integral forms and equivalent expressions are part of the problem's context but not assumptions. The problem is to prove the equality of the hypergeometric function to 4/7. The user also asks about other points where this function takes simple values, but the main problem as per the title and the first equation is the hypergeometric function equality.",
