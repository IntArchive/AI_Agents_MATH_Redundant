    "Content": "Is it true that any nonempty open set is dense in the Zariski topology on $\\mathbb{A}^n$ ? I'm pretty sure it is, but I can't think of a proof! Could someone possibly point me in the right direction? Many thanks! Note: I am not asking about the Euclidean topology at all!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "As an exercise, let's reduce everything to statements about polynomials. Every open set contains a basic open set $U$, which is the complement of the zero set of some nonzero polynomial $f$, so it suffices to show that these are Zariski dense. The Zariski closure of a set is the intersection of the zero sets of all polynomials vanishing on it. This is equal to $\\mathbb{A}^n$ if and only if any polynomial vanishing on $U$ vanishes on $\\mathbb{A}^n$. Thus the claim is equivalent to the following statement about polynomials: Suppose a polynomial $g$ has the property that if $f(x) \\neq 0$, then $g(x) = 0$. Then $g(x) = 0$ for all $x$. But the condition is equivalent to the claim that $f(x) g(x) = 0$ for all $x$. Can you finish the problem from here? (Note that you need to assume $k$ infinite.)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this Math Stack Exchange question according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor, so I need to make sure I accurately parse the problem and list the assumptions properly.\n\nFirst, let's look at the original problem. The title is \"Zariski Open Sets are Dense?\" and the question is asking if any nonempty open set in the Zariski topology on affine n-space is dense. The user mentions they're not talking about the Euclidean topology, so that's an important note.\n\nNow, applying the format. The assumptions should list each condition line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object. The problem statement is then restated clearly.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions were about the variable n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the key assumptions would relate to the Zariski topology on A^n, the nonempty open set, and the density in that topology.\n\nSo, the main objects here are the Zariski topology on A^n and the nonempty open set. The assumptions are that we're working in the Zariski topology (not Euclidean), the space is A^n, and the open set is nonempty. Each of these should be separate points in the assumptions.\n\nWait, the user specifically notes they're not asking about the Euclidean topology, so that should be an assumption to exclude that case. Also, the problem is about any nonempty open set being dense. So the assumptions would include the topology being Zariski, the space being A^n, and the open set being nonempty.\n\nLet me structure that:\n\nAssumption:\n- The topology considered is the Zariski topology on $\\mathbb{A}^n$,\n- The open set is nonempty,\n- The space is $\\mathbb{A}^n$,\n- The question is not about the Euclidean topology.\n\nWait, but maybe some of these can be combined. However, the example had each assumption on a separate line, even if they relate. For instance, in the example, the first assumption was \"n is an integer\" and the second \"n is divisible by 7.\" So each line is a separate condition.\n\nIn this problem, the key points are:\n\n1. The topology is Zariski (not Euclidean).\n2. The space is $\\mathbb{A}^n$.\n3. The open set in question is nonempty.\n\nThe user's note explicitly states they're not asking about the Euclidean topology, so that's an important assumption to list. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- The topology on $\\mathbb{A}^n$ is the Zariski topology,\n- The open set is nonempty,\n- The question does not concern the Euclidean topology.\n\nBut maybe the fact that the space is $\\mathbb{A}^n$ is part of the first assumption. Let me check the example again. In the example, the problem statement mentions \"for every integer n\", so the assumption lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So here, the problem is about $\\mathbb{A}^n$ with Zariski topology, so the first assumption could be that the space is $\\mathbb{A}^n$ with Zariski topology, then the open set is nonempty, and the exclusion of Euclidean topology. But the exclusion is more of a clarification than an assumption. Hmm.\n\nWait, the user's note says \"Note: I am not asking about the Euclidean topology at all!\" So that should be an assumption to exclude that case. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- The space considered is $\\mathbb{A}^n$ equipped with the Zariski topology,\n- The open set is nonempty,\n- The Euclidean topology is not considered in this problem.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The problem then is to prove that any nonempty open set is dense in this topology.\n\nSo putting it all together, the formatted problem would have those three assumptions and the problem statement as given.",
