    "Content": "This is an exercise in Bartle & Sherbert's Introduction to Real Analysis second edition. They ask to show that if $I=[a,b]$ is a closed bounded interval and that $f:I\\to\\mathbb{R}$ is (Riemann) integrable on $I$, then $|f|$ is integrable on $I$. Of course we know that the composition of an integrable function with a continuous function is integrable, but here they ask to prove it directly using the inequality\n$$|f(x)|-|f(y)|\\leq|f(x)-f(y)|,\\quad\\forall x,y\\in I.$$\nBy the Riemann's Criterion, $\\epsilon>0$ given, there exists a partition $P$ of $I$ such that the difference between the upper and lower sum is less than $\\epsilon$, i.e. \n$$U_f(P)-L_f(P)<\\epsilon.$$\nSo if we can show that $$U_{|f|}(P)-L_{|f|}(P)\\leq U_f(P)-L_f(P)$$\nthen we would be done.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to structure this problem following the required format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions in the original question. The user mentions that the problem is from Bartle & Sherbert's textbook. The task is to show that if a function f is Riemann integrable on a closed bounded interval I = [a, b], then the absolute value of f, |f|, is also Riemann integrable on I. \n\nThe problem provides a hint to use the inequality |f(x)| - |f(y)| ≤ |f(x) - f(y)| for all x, y in I. Additionally, it refers to Riemann's Criterion, which states that for any ε > 0, there exists a partition P such that the upper sum minus the lower sum of f is less than ε. The user is trying to show that the difference between the upper and lower sums for |f| is less than or equal to that for f, which would complete the proof.\n\nNow, breaking down the assumptions line by line. Each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. \n\nFirst, the interval I is closed and bounded: I = [a, b]. \n\nSecond, the function f is Riemann integrable on I. \n\nThird, the problem uses the inequality involving the absolute values of f(x) and f(y). \n\nFourth, the Riemann Criterion is applied, so there exists a partition P where U_f(P) - L_f(P) < ε. \n\nThe problem statement itself is to prove that |f| is Riemann integrable on I by showing U_{|f|}(P) - L_{|f|}(P) ≤ U_f(P) - L_f(P). \n\nWait, but in the original question, the user is stuck on proving that inequality. So in the Problem section, it should state that the task is to prove |f| is integrable using the given inequality and Riemann's Criterion. The key is that the problem wants a direct proof without invoking the general composition of integrable functions with continuous ones. \n\nSo the assumptions should list all the given conditions. Let me check again:\n\n1. I is a closed bounded interval [a, b].\n2. f: I → ℝ is Riemann integrable on I.\n3. The inequality |f(x)| - |f(y)| ≤ |f(x) - f(y)| holds for all x, y in I.\n4. For any ε > 0, there exists a partition P of I such that U_f(P) - L_f(P) < ε.\n\nBut actually, points 3 and 4 might be part of the approach rather than assumptions. Wait, the problem states that the user is given the inequality and is using Riemann's Criterion. The problem's original question is to show |f| is integrable by using that inequality and the Riemann's Criterion. So the assumptions are:\n\n- I is [a, b] (closed, bounded interval).\n- f is Riemann integrable on I.\n- The inequality |f(x)| - |f(y)| ≤ |f(x) - f(y)| for all x, y in I.\n- Riemann's Criterion applies to f (i.e., the existence of a partition P with U_f - L_f < ε).\n\nWait, but the Riemann Criterion is a general criterion for integrability, so the fact that f is integrable implies that such a partition exists. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n1. I is the closed bounded interval [a, b].\n2. f: I → ℝ is Riemann integrable on I.\n3. The inequality | |f(x)| - |f(y)| | ≤ |f(x) - f(y)| holds for all x, y in I. (But actually, the problem states the one-sided inequality |f(x)| - |f(y)| ≤ |f(x) - f(y)|, but the reverse triangle inequality gives | |f(x)| - |f(y)| | ≤ |f(x) - f(y)|. So maybe the problem uses that.)\n\nBut the user wrote the inequality as |f(x)| - |f(y)| ≤ |f(x) - f(y)|. Hmm. The absolute difference is bounded by the right-hand side, so the problem is using that. Therefore, the assumption here is that this inequality holds for all x, y in I.\n\nBut actually, this inequality is a general property of absolute values, not a specific assumption. Wait, the problem says \"using the inequality |f(x)| - |f(y)| ≤ |f(x) - f(y)|\", so perhaps the user is instructed to use that inequality. So in the problem statement, that inequality is given as a tool. Therefore, the assumption here is that this inequality holds for all x, y in I.\n\nBut in reality, that inequality is always true by the reverse triangle inequality. So maybe the problem is telling the student to use that known inequality. So perhaps the assumption is that the inequality holds for all x, y in I. Wait, but that's a general mathematical fact, not an assumption specific to the problem. However, since the problem instructs the student to use that inequality, it's part of the given conditions for the proof. Therefore, the assumptions would include that inequality.\n\nSo structuring the assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\n- I is the closed bounded interval [a, b].\n- f is a function from I to ℝ.\n- f is Riemann integrable on I.\n- For all x, y in I, |f(x)| - |f(y)| ≤ |f(x) - f(y)|.\n\nProblem:\nProve that |f| is Riemann integrable on I.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"show that if I=[a,b] is a closed bounded interval and that f:I→ℝ is integrable on I, then |f| is integrable on I\". So the key assumptions are the closed bounded interval and f being integrable. The inequality is a tool given in the problem to use, but it's not an assumption about the function. Therefore, maybe the assumptions are only:\n\n1. I = [a, b] is a closed bounded interval.\n2. f: I → ℝ is Riemann integrable on I.\n\nThe problem is to show that |f| is Riemann integrable on I, using the provided inequality and Riemann's Criterion.\n\nBut in the example given by the user, the assumption included specific conditions on n (like n is integer, n divisible by 7). Similarly, here the problem might include the inequality as part of the given conditions. However, in the original problem, the user is told to use that inequality. So perhaps in the Assumption section, we list:\n\n- I = [a, b] is a closed bounded interval.\n- f: I → ℝ is Riemann integrable on I.\n- For all x, y ∈ I, |f(x)| - |f(y)| ≤ |f(x) - f(y)|.\n\nBut wait, the inequality is a general property, not a specific assumption. However, since the problem statement says \"using the inequality\", maybe it's considered part of the given conditions for the proof. Alternatively, maybe it's considered part of the problem-solving approach and not an assumption. The key here is that the user is to use that inequality to show the integrability of |f|.\n\nGiven the example provided, in the original problem, the user included assumptions from the problem statement. So in the example, the problem had an assumption that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. Here, the problem's assumptions are that I is a closed bounded interval and f is Riemann integrable on I. The inequality is part of the problem-solving steps rather than an assumption. Therefore, in the Assumption section, we list:\n\nAssumption:\n- I is the closed bounded interval [a, b].\n- f is Riemann integrable on I.\n\nProblem:\nProve that |f| is Riemann integrable on I, using the inequality |f(x)| - |f(y)| ≤ |f(x) - f(y)| for all x, y ∈ I and Riemann's Criterion.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the problem is restated concisely. In their example, the problem becomes \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" with the assumptions listed as n is integer and n divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the user had to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that might be incorrect. Let me check.\n\nOriginal example's problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n (3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Then the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems like a mistake because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted version adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which is not in the original problem. So maybe the example is incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the user's example has an error, but we need to follow their format as per the instructions.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's question is to show that if f is integrable on [a,b], then |f| is integrable, using the given inequality. So the assumptions should be:\n\n1. I = [a, b] is a closed bounded interval.\n2. f: I → ℝ is Riemann integrable on I.\n\nThe problem is to prove |f| is Riemann integrable on I using the inequality |f(x)| - |f(y)| ≤ |f(x) - f(y)| for all x, y ∈ I.\n\nWait, but the original problem mentions using Riemann's Criterion. So maybe the assumption is also that Riemann's Criterion applies (i.e., for any ε > 0, there's a partition P where U_f(P) - L_f(P) < ε). However, since f is integrable, this is implied by Riemann's Criterion. Therefore, the key assumptions are the closed interval and f being integrable. The problem is to show |f| is integrable by using that inequality and the criterion.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n- I is the closed bounded interval [a, b].\n- f: I → ℝ is Riemann integrable on I.\n- For all x, y ∈ I, |f(x)| - |f(y)| ≤ |f(x) - f(y)|.\n\nProblem:\nProve that |f| is Riemann integrable on I.\n\nWait, but the problem in the original question is to prove |f| is integrable using the given inequality and showing that U_{|f|}(P) - L_{|f|}(P) ≤ U_f(P) - L_f(P). Therefore, maybe the problem statement should be to show that inequality, as that's the crux. The user wants to prove that the upper and lower sums' difference for |f| is bounded by that of f. So perhaps the problem is:\n\nProblem: Show that for any partition P of I, U_{|f|}(P) - L_{|f|}(P) ≤ U_f(P) - L_f(P).\n\nBut according to the user's original problem, they need to show |f| is integrable by using the provided inequality and the Riemann Criterion. So the problem is to prove that |f| is integrable on I, given that f is integrable, using the inequality and Riemann's Criterion.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- I is the closed bounded interval [a, b].\n- f: I → ℝ is Riemann integrable on I.\n- For all x, y ∈ I, | |f(x)| - |f(y)| | ≤ |f(x) - f(y)|. (But the user wrote the one-sided inequality, but actually, the reverse triangle inequality gives | |f(x)| - |f(y)| | ≤ |f(x) - f(y)|, which implies both |f(x)| - |f(y)| ≤ |f(x) - f(y)| and |f(y)| - |f(x)| ≤ |f(x) - f(y)|. So the user's given inequality is part of that.)\n\nBut since the problem mentions specifically that inequality, maybe we include it as an assumption. However, technically, it's a general property, not an assumption. But the user's problem says \"using the inequality...\", so perhaps we need to list it as a given condition. \n\nThus, the assumptions are:\n\n1. I is the closed bounded interval [a, b].\n2. f: I → ℝ is Riemann integrable on I.\n3. For all x, y ∈ I, |f(x)| - |f(y)| ≤ |f(x) - f(y)|.\n\nProblem: Prove that |f| is Riemann integrable on I by showing that for any partition P, U_{|f|}(P) - L_{|f|}(P) ≤ U_f(P) - L_f(P).\n\nAlternatively, the problem is as stated in the original question: Show that |f| is integrable on I using the given inequality and Riemann's Criterion.\n\nBut the user's own problem statement in the question includes the problem as \"show that if I=[a,b] and f is integrable on I, then |f| is integrable on I\". So the core problem is to prove the integrability of |f|. The use of the inequality and Riemann's Criterion is part of the approach. \n\nTherefore, following the example format, where the original problem's assumptions were filtered (even if they might have included something incorrect like adding n divisible by 7 when the original problem said for all integers n), but in this case, we should list the actual assumptions from the problem. \n\nSo, the correct assumptions are:\n\n- I is the closed bounded interval [a, b].\n- f is Riemann integrable on I.\n\nThe problem is to prove that |f| is Riemann integrable on I using the inequality |f(x)| - |f(y)| ≤ |f(x) - f(y)| for all x, y ∈ I and Riemann's Criterion.\n\nBut the example given by the user included an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) which wasn't in the original problem. So maybe they made a mistake there, but we have to follow the instructions and structure the problem correctly. \n\nWait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions included \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But that's incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", which doesn't restrict n to being divisible by 7. The formatted problem's assumption added an extra condition. This suggests that the example might have a mistake, but when structuring the current problem, we should correctly extract the assumptions from the original question.\n\nGiven that, in the current problem, the original question's assumptions are:\n\n- I = [a, b] is a closed bounded interval.\n- f: I → ℝ is Riemann integrable on I.\n\nThe problem is to prove that |f| is Riemann integrable on I using the provided inequality and Riemann's Criterion.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatted problem should have assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\n- I is the closed bounded interval [a, b].\n- f: I → ℝ is Riemann integrable on I.\n- For all x, y ∈ I, |f(x)| - |f(y)| ≤ |f(x) - f(y)|.\n\nProblem:\nProve that |f| is Riemann integrable on I.\n\nBut wait, the third assumption is redundant because the inequality is always true by the reverse triangle inequality. However, since the problem statement mentions using that specific inequality, it's included as part of the problem's given conditions, even though it's a general property.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem's assumptions are just the first two, and the inequality is part of the problem-solving steps. But according to the example provided, even if a condition is part of the general problem statement (like n being an integer), it's listed as an assumption. Therefore, in this case, the assumptions are:\n\n1. I is the closed bounded interval [a, b].\n2. f is Riemann integrable on I.\n\nThe problem is to prove that |f| is Riemann integrable on I using the inequality |f(x)| - |f(y)| ≤ |f(x) - f(y)| for all x, y ∈ I.\n\nBut the example included the specific divisibility condition, even if it wasn't in the original problem. Therefore, to avoid making similar mistakes, we need to accurately reflect the original problem's assumptions. The original problem states: \"if I=[a,b] is a closed bounded interval and that f:I→ℝ is integrable on I, then |f| is integrable on I.\" So the assumptions are:\n\n- I = [a, b] (closed bounded interval).\n- f is Riemann integrable on I.\n\nThe problem is to show |f| is integrable on I, using the given inequality and Riemann's Criterion.\n\nBut the user's question mentions using the provided inequality and the Riemann Criterion. Therefore, the problem is to prove the integrability of |f| under these assumptions and using the given tools.\n\nThus, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n- I is the closed bounded interval [a, b].\n- f: I → ℝ is Riemann integrable on I.\n- For all x, y ∈ I, |f(x)| - |f(y)| ≤ |f(x) - f(y)|.\n\nProblem:\nProve that |f| is Riemann integrable on I.\n\nBut again, the third assumption is redundant as it's a mathematical truth, but since the problem instructs to use it, perhaps it's included. Alternatively, the problem might not list it as an assumption, but since the user's example included specific assumptions even if they were redundant, maybe we should list it here.\n\nAlternatively, the third point is part of the problem-solving method rather than an assumption. But according to the example, assumptions include all conditions given in the problem. Since the problem says \"using the inequality...\", perhaps that's part of the approach, not an assumption. Therefore, maybe the assumptions are only the first two.\n\nBut given the example's structure, even if redundant, we include the conditions mentioned. For instance, in the example, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted assumption included n is an integer (which is given in the problem) and n divisible by 7, which was not in the original problem. This suggests that the example might have errors, but perhaps in this case, we should adhere strictly to the original problem's stated conditions.\n\nOriginal problem's stated conditions: I is a closed bounded interval, f is integrable on I. The rest are tools to use. Therefore, the correct assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\n- I is the closed bounded interval [a, b].\n- f: I → ℝ is Riemann integrable on I.\n\nProblem:\nProve that |f| is Riemann integrable on I using the inequality |f(x)| - |f(y)| ≤ |f(x) - f(y)| for all x, y ∈ I and Riemann's Criterion.\n\nBut according to the user's format, the problem line is just the problem statement. The example's problem line was \"Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" So in this case, the problem line would be \"Prove that |f| is Riemann integrable on I.\"\n\nBut the original problem also mentions to use the given inequality and Riemann's Criterion. Therefore, to include that in the problem statement, perhaps:\n\nProblem:\nProve that |f| is Riemann integrable on I by showing that for any partition P of I, U_{|f|}(P) - L_{|f|}(P) ≤ U_f(P) - L_f(P).\n\nBut the user's problem states \"they ask to show that...\", so the core problem is to prove |f| is integrable. The method is to use the inequality and Riemann's Criterion, but the actual problem is to prove integrability.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n- I is the closed bounded interval [a, b].\n- f: I → ℝ is Riemann integrable on I.\n\nProblem:\nProve that |f| is Riemann integrable on I.\n\nBut then, how does the example fit in? In the example, the formatted problem included assumptions beyond the original problem (adding n divisible by 7). It seems the example might be incorrect, but we have to follow the user's instructions to structure the problem by filtering unrelated information and listing assumptions line by line.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question has no unrelated information. The assumptions are I is [a,b], f is integrable. The problem is to prove |f| is integrable. The user is stuck on showing U_{|f|}(P) - L_{|f|}(P) ≤ U_f(P) - L_f(P). So maybe the problem should be phrased as showing that inequality, which would then imply the integrability via Riemann's Criterion.\n\nBut the actual problem as stated in the original question is to show |f| is integrable. So perhaps the formatted problem is:\n\nAssumption:\n- I is the closed bounded interval [a, b].\n- f: I → ℝ is Riemann integrable on I.\n- For all x, y ∈ I, |f(x)| - |f(y)| ≤ |f(x) - f(y)|.\n\nProblem:\nProve that |f| is Riemann integrable on I by demonstrating that for any partition P of I, U_{|f|}(P) - L_{|f|}(P) ≤ U_f(P) - L_f(P).\n\nBut the user's example didn't include method details in the problem statement. The example's problem line was \"Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" So perhaps in this case, the problem line is just \"Prove that |f| is Riemann integrable on I.\"\n\nThe assumptions would then be:\n\n- I is the closed bounded interval [a, b].\n- f is Riemann integrable on I.\n- For all x, y ∈ I, |f(x)| - |f(y)| ≤ |f(x) - f(y)|.\n\nBut since the inequality is a general property, maybe it's not an assumption. However, since the problem instructs to use it, perhaps it's considered part of the problem's given conditions. Alternatively, it's part of the mathematical tools, not assumptions about the problem's parameters.\n\nGiven the user's example included an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) not present in the original problem, but we need to be accurate here. Therefore, the correct assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\n- I is the closed bounded interval [a, b].\n- f: I → ℝ is Riemann integrable on I.\n\nProblem:\nProve that |f| is Riemann integrable on I using the inequality |f(x)| - |f(y)| ≤ |f(x) - f(y)| for all x, y ∈ I.\n\nBut according to the user's instructions, the problem should be structured into Assumption and Problem sections, with assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nI is the closed bounded interval [a, b],\nf is a function from I to ℝ,\nf is Riemann integrable on I,\nFor all x, y in I, |f(x)| - |f(y)| ≤ |f(x) - f(y)|.\nProblem:\nProve that |f| is Riemann integrable on I.\n###END_OF_FORMAT###",
