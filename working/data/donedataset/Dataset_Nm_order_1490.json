    "Content": "Let $$w~=~\\dfrac{-y}{x^2+y^2}dx+\\dfrac{x}{x^2+y^2}dy, \\qquad (x,y)~\\in\\mathbb{R}^2\\backslash \\{(0,0)\\}.$$ Showing that $w$ is closed is easy. Just calculate $dw$ and you'll get 0. But how do I show that $w$ is not exact? In other words, I need to prove that there is no form $\\lambda$ such that $w=d \\lambda$ Should I assume that $w=d \\lambda$ and try to get to a contradiction?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I think that perhaps one of the most illuminating ways to look at this is to transform $w$ to polar coordinates.  Since $w = -\\dfrac{y}{x^2 + y^2}dx + \\dfrac{x}{x^2 +y^2}dy, \\tag{1}$ with $x = r\\cos \\theta, \\tag{2}$ $y = r\\sin \\theta, \\tag{3}$ we immediately see that $r^2 = x^2 + y^2, \\tag{4}$ leading to $w = -\\dfrac{\\sin \\theta}{r} dx + \\dfrac{\\cos \\theta}{r} dy; \\tag{5}$ we also have, from (2) and (3), that $dx = (\\cos \\theta) dr - r(\\sin \\theta)d\\theta, \\tag{6}$ $dy = (\\sin \\theta) dr + r(\\cos \\theta)d \\theta, \\tag{7}$ and plugging (6) and (7) into (5) yields, after a little algebraic maneuvering, $w = d\\theta. \\tag{8}$ Of course in performing the above calculations, we need to remember one little caveat :  we must stay away from the point $(x, y) = 0$ , that is $r = 0$ , where in fact $w$ isn't even defined; we are in \"point\" of fact operating in the punctured plane $\\Bbb R^2 \\setminus \\{ 0 \\}$ .  And though (8) gives the superficial impression that $w$ is exact, this only appears to be the case, since $\\theta$ is not in fact definable as a function on $\\Bbb R^2 \\setminus \\{ 0\\}$ .  This of course may be concluded from the fact that in traversing a circular path centered at the origin the value if $\\theta$ will have increased by $2\\pi$ when the starting point is first re-visited; we can in fact express this observation in integral form by computing the line integral of $w = d\\theta$ around a circle of radius $R$ centered at the origin.  Let then the circle be given parametrically by $c(t) = (R\\cos t, R \\sin t)$ , $0 \\le t \\le 2 \\pi$ ; we have $\\displaystyle \\int_c w = \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\theta(c(t))(\\dot c(t))dt$ $= \\displaystyle \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\theta(c(t))((-R\\sin t, R\\cos t)^T)dt, \\tag{9}$ and if we combine (5) and (8) with the definition of $c(t)$ we see that $d\\theta(c(t)) = -\\dfrac{\\sin t}{R} dx + \\dfrac{\\cos t}{R} dy, \\tag{10}$ and thus $d\\theta(c(t))(\\dot c(t)) = \\sin^2 t + \\cos^2 t = 1, \\tag{11}$ and the integral becomes $\\displaystyle \\int_c w = \\int_0^{2\\pi} dt = 2\\pi. \\tag{12}$ (12) shows that:  i.) $w = d\\theta$ is not exact in $\\Bbb R^2 \\setminus \\{ 0 \\}$ ; and ii.) $\\theta$ cannot really be defined as a function on $\\Bbb R^2 \\setminus \\{ 0 \\}$ , since we obtain multiple values by integrating $d\\theta$ over a path such as $c(t)$ .  But I guess the main point here is that $w$ is indeed not exact, and this is how it is shown. Hope this helps.  Cheerio, and as always, Fiat Lux!!!",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The question is about showing that a differential form w is closed but not exact. The user wants the assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions. The form w is given as (-y/(x²+y²))dx + (x/(x²+y²))dy, defined on ℝ² without the origin. So the domain is important here. The problem states that showing it's closed is easy by computing dw and getting zero, but the main task is to show it's not exact. \n\nSo the assumptions should include the definition of w, the domain it's defined on, and perhaps that w is closed since that's part of the problem statement. Wait, but in the example given earlier, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So here, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The differential form w is defined as (-y/(x² + y²))dx + (x/(x² + y²))dy.\n- The domain of w is ℝ² \\ {(0,0)}.\n- The form w is closed (since dw = 0). \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"showing that w is closed is easy\" but the actual task is to show it's not exact. However, the user's example included the divisibility by 7 as an assumption even though it was part of the original problem. Maybe here, the fact that w is closed is part of the problem's given conditions? Hmm, the original problem states that showing w is closed is easy, but the user is asked to show it's not exact. So perhaps the closedness is a given property here, but in the problem statement, they need to prove it's closed and not exact. Wait, no, the problem says \"Show that the form w is closed but not exact\". So the problem has two parts: show closed, show not exact. But in the example provided by the user, the formatted problem only included the divisibility by 7 as an assumption, which was part of the original problem's conditions. So here, maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- The differential form w is defined as (-y/(x² + y²))dx + (x/(x² + y²))dy.\n- The domain of w is ℝ² \\ {(0,0)}.\n\nBecause the closedness is something they have to show, but the problem includes that as part of the task. Wait, but in the original problem, the user says \"Showing that w is closed is easy. Just calculate dw and you'll get 0. But how do I show that w is not exact?\" So the problem is divided into two parts: closed and not exact. But the problem statement is \"Show that the form w is closed but not exact\". So the problem as a whole is to show both. But the user's example only included the assumptions, not the steps. So in the formatted problem, the assumptions are the given conditions. So here, the assumptions would be the definition of w and its domain. The problem is to show that w is closed but not exact. But wait, the example included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the original problem's conditions. So in this case, the problem is to show closed and not exact, but the assumptions are the form of w and its domain. The closedness is part of what needs to be proven, not an assumption. So perhaps the assumptions are only the form and the domain. Then the problem is to show that w is closed but not exact. But the user's example had the assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the problem's conditions. Wait, looking back at the example: the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted problem's assumption included that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, it was for every integer n, so maybe the formatted problem had a mistake? Or perhaps the user made an error. Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Because the original problem doesn't restrict n to be divisible by 7; it's for all integers. But the formatted problem added that assumption. That suggests that maybe the example was structured incorrectly, but the user wants the same approach here. Wait, maybe the example was from a different problem? Wait, let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut that seems wrong because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", not just those divisible by 7. So perhaps the example is incorrect. But the user provided that example, so I need to follow their format even if the example has a mistake. Therefore, in their formatting, assumptions include all given conditions, even if they are for all n. Wait, but in the example, the original problem doesn't have the condition that n is divisible by 7. So why is that in the assumptions? That seems like a mistake. Maybe the user intended to have the assumptions as the problem's conditions, but the example was wrong. Hmm, this complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps the example is correct, and the original problem had a hidden assumption. Wait, maybe the original problem had a typo, and the user corrected it in the formatted version. But I can't check that. Given that, I have to proceed with the user's example as guidance, even if it seems incorrect.\n\nIn the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. So perhaps the user is including both the universal condition (n is integer) and an additional assumption (n divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem. That suggests that the example might be incorrect, but since the user provided it, I have to follow their approach. However, in the current problem, the original question is to show that w is closed but not exact. The assumptions here would be the definition of w and its domain. The fact that w is closed is part of what needs to be proven, so it's not an assumption. So the problem's assumptions are:\n\n- The differential form w is defined as (-y/(x² + y²))dx + (x/(x² + y²))dy.\n- The domain of w is ℝ² \\ {(0,0)}.\n\nAnd the problem is to show that w is closed but not exact. However, the user's example included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem's statement. Therefore, maybe the user wants to list all given conditions as assumptions, even if they are part of the problem's statement. So in this case, the problem's assumptions are the form w and its domain. The problem is to show it's closed but not exact. So I think that's the correct way. Let me verify with the user's example. The original example's problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem's assumptions were n is an integer, n divisible by 7. But that seems contradictory because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which would mean the only assumption is that n is an integer, and the conclusion is divisibility by 91. But the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\", which restricts it. That suggests that perhaps the example is incorrect, but I have to proceed with the given information.\n\nTherefore, for the current problem, the assumptions should be:\n\n- The differential form w is defined as (-y/(x² + y²)dx + (x/(x² + y²))dy.\n- The domain of w is ℝ² \\ {(0,0)}.\n\nThe problem is to show that w is closed but not exact. But the original problem mentions that showing it's closed is easy by calculating dw and getting 0. So maybe the closed part is considered a given property here? But no, the problem asks to show both closed and not exact. So perhaps the assumptions are just the definition and domain, and the problem is to show closed and not exact. Therefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe differential form w is defined as \\(\\dfrac{-y}{x^2+y^2}dx + \\dfrac{x}{x^2+y^2}dy\\),\nThe domain of w is \\(\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\{(0,0\\}\\}\\).\n\nProblem:\nShow that w is closed but not exact.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the problem was rephrased to only include the specific task after the assumptions. The original problem in the example was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, and the formatted problem's problem statement is to prove divisibility by 91, with the assumptions being n is an integer and divisible by 7. So perhaps in that case, the user made a mistake, but for this current problem, we need to follow the structure correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions are the conditions under which the problem is posed. Since the form w is defined on the punctured plane, that's an assumption. The problem is to show closedness and non-exactness. So the answer should be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe differential form \\( w = \\dfrac{-y}{x^2+y^2}dx + \\dfrac{x}{x^2+y^2}dy \\) is defined on \\( \\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\} \\).\n\nProblem:\nShow that \\( w \\) is closed but not exact.\n\nWait, but in the example, each assumption is one line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So here, the two assumptions would be:\n\n- The differential form w is defined as \\(\\dfrac{-y}{x^2+y^2}dx + \\dfrac{x}{x^2+y^2}dy\\).\n- The domain of w is \\(\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}\\).\n\nThen the problem is to show that w is closed but not exact.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Each assumption is a separate line, one defining the form, the other the domain. Then the problem is to show closed and not exact.",
