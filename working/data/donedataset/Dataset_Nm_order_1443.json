    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that (1 + 1/π)^(π + 1) < π without using a calculator. The original question mentions trying to take the derivative of a function f(x) = x - (1 + 1/x)^(x+1) and showing it's greater than zero at x = π, but found it too hard.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the problem correctly. The main goal is to show the inequality holds. Let's check if there are any assumptions given. The problem statement doesn't explicitly state any conditions, but since π is a specific constant (~3.14159), we can assume that x in the function f(x) is a positive real number, and specifically here x = π. However, the user didn't mention any other constraints, so the assumptions would primarily be that π is the mathematical constant, and we're evaluating the inequality at x = π.\n\nWait, the original example had some assumptions like n being an integer and divisible by 7. But in this case, the problem is about π, which is a fixed constant. So maybe there are no additional assumptions beyond the standard properties of π. The user might have tried using calculus (derivatives) but found it difficult. So, perhaps the assumptions here are just the standard definitions and properties of π and the function involved. Since the problem is to prove an inequality involving π, the key assumption is that π is the transcendental number approximately 3.14159, and the function f(x) is defined as given. However, the problem statement doesn't impose any conditions on π other than it being the usual constant. Therefore, the assumption here is just that π is the mathematical constant. But since the problem is to prove the inequality at x = π, maybe the assumption is that x = π. Alternatively, maybe the problem is more general, but the user specifically wants to show it for x = π. Wait, the problem is written as \"Prove that (1 + 1/π)^{π + 1} < π\". So the variable here is fixed at π. Therefore, the only assumption needed is that π is the mathematical constant. However, in the example provided earlier, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7, even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n\". Wait, maybe the example had a mistake? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", which seems incorrect. Wait, no, looking back, the original problem in the example was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem's assumption was \"$n$ is an integer, $n$ is divisible by $7$.\" But that seems conflicting because the original says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be an error. Wait, perhaps the example was incorrect. But regardless, the current problem is to format the given question into the specified structure.\n\nSo, for the current problem: \"Prove that (1 + 1/π)^{π + 1} < π without using a calculator.\" The user tried to use the derivative of f(x) = x - (1 + 1/x)^{x+1} at x = π but found it hard. The problem is to prove this inequality. The assumptions here would be:\n\n- π is the mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159.\n- The function f(x) = x - (1 + 1/x)^{x+1} is considered.\n- The inequality is evaluated at x = π.\n\nBut maybe the problem is purely to show the inequality holds for x = π, so the main assumption is just that x = π. However, since π is a constant, maybe the only assumption is that we are working with the standard value of π. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is part of a more general inequality, but the user specifically wants to check at x = π. In the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer, but in this case, the problem doesn't have variables; it's a specific inequality at a specific point. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions section here is minimal. The key point is that we're dealing with the constant π and the expression (1 + 1/π)^{π + 1}.\n\nBut according to the format, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n- π is the mathematical constant approximately 3.14159...\n- The expression (1 + 1/π)^{π + 1} is evaluated using real number exponentiation.\n\nBut the problem itself is to prove that this expression is less than π. Alternatively, maybe the function f(x) is part of the assumptions? The user defined f(x) = x - (1 + 1/x)^{x+1} and tried to show its derivative at x=π is positive. But the problem statement is to prove the inequality, not necessarily using calculus. So perhaps the function f(x) is part of their approach, not part of the problem's inherent assumptions. Therefore, the problem's assumptions would just be about π and the expression. However, since π is a well-known constant, maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond it being the standard π. Therefore, the assumptions section might be empty, but according to the example, even if the original problem didn't state assumptions, we have to list them. Wait, the example had the original problem stating \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems like an error. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an extra condition that n is divisible by 7, which was not in the original. That suggests maybe the example was incorrect. Therefore, perhaps in this current problem, since there are no additional conditions beyond the standard π, the assumptions section would just list π as the mathematical constant. Alternatively, if the problem is to prove the inequality for x = π, then the assumption is x = π. But the problem is stated as \"Prove (1 + 1/π)^{π + 1} < π\", so the only variable here is π itself, which is a fixed constant. Therefore, maybe there are no assumptions needed beyond the standard definition of π. However, the format requires listing assumptions line by line. Perhaps in this case, since there are no explicit assumptions given in the problem, we need to infer the necessary ones. For example, that π is a positive real number greater than 1, which it is. But π is a specific constant, so maybe the assumption is just that π is the mathematical constant. Alternatively, considering that the expression involves exponents, maybe we assume that exponentiation is defined for real numbers, which it is. But perhaps the key assumption here is that π is the transcendental constant approximately 3.14159. However, since the problem is to prove an inequality at a specific point, the assumptions might be minimal. \n\nGiven the example provided by the user, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem listed assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That seems to be a mistake, but perhaps the user intended that the formatted problem should extract any conditions from the problem statement. However, in the current problem, there are no such conditions. The problem is to prove an inequality at π, which is a fixed constant. Therefore, the assumptions might just be that π is the mathematical constant. But maybe the function's properties are part of the assumptions? For example, the function f(x) = x - (1 + 1/x)^{x+1} is differentiable, but that's more of a general property, not an assumption. \n\nGiven the user's example, they included assumptions that were not explicitly stated in the original problem. The original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That suggests that perhaps in the example, there was a mistake, or maybe the user intended to modify the problem. However, following the user's example, perhaps in the current problem, we need to list the assumptions as:\n\n- π is the mathematical constant.\n- The exponentiation is defined for real numbers.\n\nBut these are very basic and might be considered implicit. Alternatively, since the user tried using the derivative of f(x) at x = π, maybe the problem assumes that x is a real number and f(x) is differentiable. However, the problem statement itself doesn't require calculus; the user mentioned their attempt involved derivatives. The actual problem is to prove the inequality without using a calculator, so maybe the assumptions are just about π being the standard constant. \n\nGiven that the problem is to format the problem according to the given structure, and the example included assumptions even when the original problem didn't state them explicitly (like n being divisible by 7), perhaps in this case, the assumption is simply that π is the mathematical constant. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\n- π is the mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\left(1+\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\right)^{\\pi+1}<\\pi$$ without using a calculator.\n\nThis seems to fit the required format. The assumption here clarifies that we're dealing with the standard π, and the problem is as stated. The original problem didn't have other conditions, so this should suffice.",
