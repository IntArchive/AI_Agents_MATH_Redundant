    "Content": "This is Exercise 2.20 in Atiyah-Macdonald. How can we prove that $\\varinjlim (M_i \\otimes N) \\cong (\\varinjlim M_i) \\otimes N$ ? Atiyah-Macdonald give a suggestion, they say that one should obtain a map $g \\colon (\\varinjlim M_i )\\times N \\longrightarrow \\varinjlim (M_i \\otimes N)$,  but I don't know how to do this. Thanks.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "One way is to use the adjunction property of the tensor product. For any $R$-module $P$, we have the following sequence of canonical $R$-module isomorphisms: $$\\begin{eqnarray}\\hom(\\varinjlim(M_i \\otimes N), P) \\cong&& \\varprojlim \\hom(M_i \\otimes N, P) \\\\ \\cong && \\varprojlim \\hom(N, \\hom(M_i, P)) \\\\ \\cong && \\hom(N, \\varprojlim \\hom(M_i, P)) \\\\ \\cong&& \\hom(N,\\hom(\\varinjlim M_i, P)) \\\\ \\cong&& \\hom((\\varinjlim M_i) \\otimes N, P)\\end{eqnarray}$$ and thus $$\\hom(\\varinjlim(M_i \\otimes N), -) \\cong \\hom((\\varinjlim M_i) \\otimes N, -).$$ By the Yoneda lemma, $$\\varinjlim(M_i \\otimes N) \\cong (\\varinjlim M_i) \\otimes N.$$ Of course, I made no use of the properties of the tensor product, other than its left-adjointness. The same argument shows that a functor which is left adjoint commutes with direct limits . Dually, a functor which is right adjoint commutes with inverse limits . The proof which A&M suggest is basically just an expanded version of the same argument - see if you can figure it out! Addendum : I'm not going to write the detailed proof from first principles (it's long) but I'll expand a bit on the hint in A&M. Here is the hint as it is in my edition, where they write $P=\\varinjlim(M_i \\otimes N)$ and $M=\\varinjlim M_i$: [...] For each $i\\in I$, let $g_i:M_i \\times N\\to M_i\\otimes N$ by the canonical bilinear mapping. Passing to the limit we obtain a mapping $g: M\\times N \\to P$. Show that $g$ is $A$-bilinear and hence defines a homomorphism $\\phi: M\\otimes N \\to P$. Verify that $\\psi\\circ \\phi$ and $\\phi \\circ \\psi$ are identity mappings. Here $\\phi: P \\to M\\otimes N$ has been defined earlier as the limit of all the canonical homomorphisms $\\mu_i\\otimes 1 : M_i\\otimes N \\to M \\otimes N$ where $\\mu_i$ is the canonical homomorphism $M_i \\to M$. It's a pretty good hint! The only difficulty is the part in bold. We do not know how to take the limit of the $M_i \\times N$ because we are not considering those as $R$-modules in the construction of the tensor product. We are considering $M_i \\times N$ as a suitable domain for bilinear maps. Obtaining the map $\\psi$ will be done in a few stages: Obtain bilinear maps $M_i \\times N \\to P$ by composing $g_i$ with the canonical homomorphism $M_i\\otimes N \\to P$; Convert these to homomorphisms $M_i \\to \\hom(N,P)$ by using the fact that a bilinear map $M_i \\times N \\to P$ is the same thing as family of homomorphism $N \\to P$ parametrized $R$-linearly by the elements of $M_i$; Show that the homomorphisms $M_i \\to \\hom(N,P)$ thus obtained commute with the structure maps $\\mu_i$ of the direct system of the $M_i$'s, and therefore obtain a homomorphism $M \\to \\hom(N,P)$ by the universal property of the direct limit. Convert this homomorphism back to a bilinear map $M \\times N \\to P$. Use the universal property of the tensor product to factor this map through $M\\otimes N \\to P$, which is the $\\psi$ you need. Then you must verify that $\\psi$ and $\\phi$ are inverses to each other.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure a problem from Math Stack Exchange into their specified format. The example they gave involved listing each assumption line by line, focusing on single properties per line and one object each. Then the problem statement itself.\n\nThe original problem here is about tensor products commuting with direct limits. The question is from Atiyah-Macdonald Exercise 2.20. The user is asking for help on proving that the direct limit of (M_i tensor N) is isomorphic to (direct limit of M_i) tensor N. They mention that Atiyah-Macdonald suggest constructing a map g from (lim M_i) x N to lim (M_i tensor N), but the user is stuck on how to do that.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the problem and extract the assumptions. Let me recall the context of direct limits and tensor products. In category theory, a direct limit (or inductive limit) is a way to glue together modules (or other structures) that are part of a directed system. Tensor products, on the other hand, are linear in both arguments. The problem is asserting that these two constructions commute, which is a useful property.\n\nSo the main assumptions here would be about the objects involved. Let's see:\n\n1. We have a direct system of modules {M_i} over some ring. The direct limit is taken over this system.\n2. The tensor product is with another module N.\n3. The category we're working in is modules over a ring (since Atiyah-Macdonald deals with commutative algebra, likely modules over a commutative ring with identity).\n4. The direct limit exists in this category (which it does for modules).\n5. The tensor product functor is being applied, which is a right exact functor, but here we need it to commute with direct limits.\n\nWait, but the problem as stated doesn't specify the ring or that N is a module. But in Atiyah-Macdonald, the context is modules over a commutative ring. So perhaps the assumptions should include that all M_i and N are modules over the same commutative ring. Also, the direct system is a directed system of modules.\n\nBut the user's example had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Each line for one property. Here, maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n- {M_i} is a directed system of modules over a commutative ring R,\n- N is a module over R,\n- The tensor product is taken over R,\n- The direct limits are considered in the category of R-modules.\n\nBut wait, the problem as posed in the question doesn't explicitly state all these, but in the context of Atiyah-Macdonald, these are standard assumptions. However, since the user wants to filter unrelated information and structure the problem, perhaps the necessary assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nEach M_i is a module over a commutative ring R,\nN is a module over R,\nThe index set of the direct system is directed,\nThe tensor products and direct limits are taken in the category of R-modules.\n\nBut perhaps even more basic. The problem statement in the original question is: \"Prove that $\\varinjlim (M_i \\otimes N) \\cong (\\varinjlim M_i) \\otimes N$\". The key assumptions here are:\n\n- The M_i form a direct system (so there are homomorphisms M_i → M_j for i ≤ j, satisfying compatibility conditions)\n- N is a fixed module\n- The tensor product is over R, and R is commutative (since tensor products of R-modules require some conditions; in Atiyah-Macdonald, R is commutative)\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user might not mention R being commutative, but in the context of Atiyah-Macdonald, R is commutative. However, since the user is just structuring the problem, maybe the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\n{M_i} is a directed system of modules over a commutative ring R,\nN is a module over R,\nThe tensor product $\\otimes$ is over R,\nThe direct limit $\\varinjlim$ is taken in the category of R-modules.\n\nEach of these is a separate line. So each assumption line should address one property of one object. So breaking them down:\n\n- {M_i} is a directed system of modules over a commutative ring R,\n- N is a module over R,\n- The tensor product is taken over R,\n- The direct limit is taken in the category of R-modules.\n\nBut maybe \"directed system\" already implies that the index set is directed. Alternatively, perhaps:\n\n- {M_i} is a direct system of R-modules indexed by a directed set,\n- N is an R-module,\n- All tensor products are over R.\n\nBut how detailed to be? The original example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Each assumption on a separate line. Here, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nEach M_i is a module over a commutative ring R,\nThe modules M_i form a directed system,\nN is a module over R,\nThe tensor product is over R,\nThe direct limit is taken in the category of R-modules.\n\nBut maybe \"form a directed system\" already includes that they are over R and the index set is directed. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe:\n\n- {M_i} is a directed system in the category of R-modules,\n- N is an R-module,\n- R is a commutative ring.\n\nBut the problem might not state that R is commutative, but in Atiyah-Macdonald, R is commutative. However, the original problem statement in the question didn't mention R. The user just says \"tensor products commute with direct limits\". So maybe to make the assumptions explicit:\n\nAssumption:\nR is a commutative ring,\n{M_i} is a directed system of R-modules,\nN is an R-module,\nTensor products are taken over R,\nDirect limits are considered in the category of R-modules.\n\nEach of these in separate lines. Then the problem is to prove the isomorphism.\n\nSo putting it all together, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nR is a commutative ring,\n{M_i} is a directed system of R-modules,\nN is an R-module,\nTensor products are taken over R,\nDirect limits are considered in the category of R-modules.\nProblem:\nProve that $\\varinjlim (M_i \\otimes_R N) \\cong (\\varinjlim M_i) \\otimes_R N$.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user wrote $\\varinjlim (M_i \\otimes N)$, so perhaps in the problem statement, it's just $\\otimes$ without R, but since we need to specify over which ring, maybe in the assumptions, it's clarified that tensor is over R.\n\nAlternatively, if R is part of the assumptions, then the problem statement can use $\\otimes_R$.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem statement in the original question was written in a context where R is understood, so maybe the assumptions are more succinct.\n\nBut according to the example, the user's example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. So here, the key assumptions are:\n\n- R is a commutative ring (since tensor products of modules over non-commutative rings require more care and the isomorphism might not hold),\n- {M_i} is a directed system of R-modules,\n- N is an R-module.\n\nPossibly, but perhaps even more minimal. The problem in Atiyah-Macdonald is in the context of R-modules where R is commutative. So the essential assumptions are that we have a directed system of modules and another module N. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n{M_i} is a directed system of modules over a commutative ring,\nN is a module over the same ring,\nThe direct limit is taken over the directed system,\nTensor products are taken over the commutative ring.\n\nBut each as separate lines. For example:\n\nAssumption:\nR is a commutative ring,\n{M_i} is a directed system of R-modules,\nN is an R-module,\nThe direct limit is taken in the category of R-modules,\nTensor products are over R.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there is an isomorphism $\\varinjlim (M_i \\otimes_R N) \\cong (\\varinjlim M_i) \\otimes_R N$.\n\nI think that's the correct structure. Each assumption is on its own line, addressing one property or condition of one object. Then the problem statement.",
