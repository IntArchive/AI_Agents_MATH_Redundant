    "Content": "I have solutions to Exercises 5.16–5.19 in Atiyah–Macdonald's Introduction to Commutative Algebra, but not in the order desired; I find myself needing later exercises to do earlier ones, and it's been frustrating me. Online solution sets (I count five, in various stages of completion) seem to either not notice this problem or treat it as something too obvious to merit consideration. For context, the first part of 5.16 is Noether's normalization lemma, which is fine, and 5.18 is Zariski's Lemma, which is proved in the text two times, and is accessible to (at least) two  natural proofs at this point. What I can't do is to obtain the second part of 5.16 without using 5.17, or prove 5.17 without using 5.18. Moreover, 5.19 specifically asks one to prove 5.17 using 5.18 (which I can do), so the strong implication is that the original solutions should not require use of Zariski's Lemma. $k$ is an infinite field, assumed algebraically closed in 5.17 but not 5.16. The first part of 5.17 is that if an affine variety $X$ in $k^n$ has ideal $I(X)$ a proper subset of $k[t_1,\\ldots,t_n]$, then $X$ is not empty. This follows immediately from the second part of 5.16. The second part of 5.16 is that for any subvariety $X$ of $k^n$ there are an $r \\leq n$ \nand a linear map $k^n \\to k^r$ taking $X$ onto all of $k^r$. The natural candidate map follows from Noether normalization, but my approach to surjectivity seems to require the second part of 5.17. The second part of 5.17 is that every maximal ideal of $k[t_1,\\ldots,t_n]$ is of the form $(t_1 - a_1,\\ldots,t_n - a_n)$ for some $a_i \\in k$. From this one can show a similar result for the coordinate ring of a subvariety of $k^n$. So this mess will be fixed if I can prove the second parts of 5.16 and 5.17 without reference to later material. In more detail, my current approach to the second part of 5.16 is as follows. Noether normalization shows $A$ is integral over some polynomial ring $A' := k[y_1,\\ldots,y_r]$ in $r \\leq n$ indeterminates. The proof of Noether normalization, at least in case $k$ is infinite, gives the $y_i$ as $k$-linear combinations of the natural generators $x_1,\\ldots,x_n$ of $A$, the coordinate functions on $X$. If we say $y_i = \\sum a_{ij} x_j$, then the projection $k^n \\to k^r$ should be given by $(z_1,\\ldots,z_n) \\mapsto\n\\big(\\sum_{j=1}^n a_{1j}z_j,\\ldots,\\sum_{j=1}^n a_{rj}z_j,\\big)$. It's not immediately obvious to me that it is surjective. However, letting $\\textrm{Max}(A) \\subseteq \\textrm{Spec}(A)$ denote the set of maximal ideals of $A$, results of Chapter 5 show that the map $\\textrm{Max}(A) \\to \\textrm{Max}(A')$ induced by $k^n \\to k^r$ is surjective. If we know each maximal ideal of $A$ is of the form $(x_1-c_1,\\ldots,x_n-c_n)$ for some $(c_1,\\ldots,c_n) \\in X$, then we can identify $X$ and $\\textrm{Max}(A)$, and that will show the map $X \\to k^r$ is surjective. That seems, however, not to be what they want, and also like too much work. My current approach to the second part of 5.17 is to use the weak Nullstellensatz (if $k$ is algebraically closed and $\\mathfrak a$ is a proper ideal of $k[t_1,\\ldots,t_n]$, then there is at least one point of $k^n$ at which $\\mathfrak a$ vanishes). The weak Nullstellensatz implies the first part of 5.17, but the reverse implication is not obvious to me. This implication is certainly proved by, e.g., the strong Nullstellensatz, but that would be completely missing the point. Update : To clarify, the text of 5.16, excluding a long hint about the first part, is as follows. Let $k$ be a field and let $A \\neq 0$ be a finitely generated $k$-algebra.\n  Then there exist elements $y_1,\\ldots,y_r \\in A$ which are algebraically \n  independent over $k$ and such that $A$ is integral over \n  $k[y_1,\\ldots,y_r]$. We shall assume that $k$ is infinite .\n  (The result is still true if $k$ is finite, but a different proof is needed.) ... From the proof  it follows that $y_1,\\ldots, y_r$ \n  may be chosen to be linear combinations of $x_1,\\ldots,x_n$.\n  This has the following geometrical interpretation:\n  if $k$ is algebraically closed and $X\\!$ is an affine algebraic variety in $k^n$\n  with coordinate ring $A \\neq 0$, then there exists a linear subspace $L$ \n  of dimension $r$ in $k^n$ and a linear mapping of $k^n$ onto $L$ \n  which maps $X\\!$ onto $L$ [Use Exercise 2]. I had forgotten about that hint... Here is what Ex. 5.2 says. Let $A$ be a subring of a ring $B$ such that $B$ is integral over $A$,\n  and let $f\\colon A \\to \\Omega$ be a homomorphism of $A$ into \n  an algebraically closed field $\\Omega$.\n  Show that $f\\!$ can be extended to a homomorphism of $B$ into $\\Omega$. [Use (5.10).]",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You haven't said what it means in this context for $X$ to be \"nonempty\", but I presume it means that there is a $\\overline{k}$-valued point of $X$.  (Certainly $X$ need not admit a $k$-valued point if $k$ is not algebraically closed, so considering $\\overline{k}$-valued points seems to be the most sensible interpretation.) With this interpretation, the non-emptiness of $X$ follows directly from Noether normalization together with Exercise 5.2: If $A$ is the coordiante ring of $X$, assumed to be non-zero, then Noether normalization gives an integral injective map $k[y_1,\\ldots,y_r] \\hookrightarrow A,$ for some $0 \\leq r \\leq n$.  Exercise 5.2 then guarantees that any\nmap $k[y_1,\\ldots,y_r] \\to \\overline{k}$ can be extended to a map\n$A \\to \\overline{k}$; this is the desired surjectivity. [Added:] Having read the comments below, let me try again.  Rereading the second part of 5.16, I see that in fact $k$ is to be assumed algebraically closed, so that $k = \\overline{k}$; this simplifies the above discussion, by removing the need to talk about $\\overline{k}$-valued points. So we have $X \\subset k^n$ cut out by some non-unit ideal $I \\subset k[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]$, an integral injection $k[y_1,\\ldots,y_r] \\hookrightarrow A := k[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]/I,$ and our goal is to prove that the induced map\n$X \\to k^r$ is surjective.  The argument written above proves this: any point of $k^r$ corresponds to a map $k[y_1,\\ldots,y_r] \\to k.$  Exercise 5.2 extends this to a map $A \\to k.$  This gives a point of $X$ mapping to the given point of $k^r$.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this. The user wants me to act as a math professor, read the Math Stack Exchange question, filter out unrelated info, and structure it into the specified format with Assumptions and Problem.\n\nThe example given shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. The problem is then stated clearly.\n\nLooking at the original problem from the user's example, they took the problem about proving A(n) is divisible by 91 and structured it into assumptions and the problem. The key was extracting the essential assumptions: n is an integer and divisible by 7. Then the problem statement is simplified.\n\nNow, the current problem is from Atiyah-Macdonald Exercises 5.16-5.19. The user is struggling with dependencies between the exercises and wants the problem structured properly.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the core problem the user is asking about. The main issue seems to be proving the second part of Exercise 5.16 without using later exercises like 5.17 or 5.18. The original problem statement is a bit long, but the key points are:\n\n- The problem is about affine varieties and coordinate rings.\n- k is an infinite field (algebraically closed in 5.17 but not necessarily in 5.16).\n- Using Noether normalization lemma (first part of 5.16).\n- The goal is to show that for a subvariety X of k^n, there's a linear map from k^n to k^r that maps X onto k^r.\n- The user mentions that surjectivity of the map is the issue and refers to using Exercise 5.2 which involves extending homomorphisms from integral extensions.\n\nSo, the main problem is the second part of Exercise 5.16, which is the geometrical interpretation part. The assumptions would include:\n\n- k is an infinite field.\n- X is an affine algebraic variety in k^n with coordinate ring A ≠ 0.\n- A is a finitely generated k-algebra.\n- The elements y1,...,yr are linear combinations of the coordinate functions (from Noether normalization).\n\nEach assumption should be a single line. Then, the problem is to show that there's a linear map from k^n onto a subspace L of dimension r mapping X onto L.\n\nWait, the problem statement in the original text says: \"if k is algebraically closed and X is an affine algebraic variety in k^n with coordinate ring A ≠ 0, then there exists a linear subspace L of dimension r in k^n and a linear mapping of k^n onto L which maps X onto L [Use Exercise 2].\"\n\nBut the user's question mentions that k is algebraically closed in 5.17 but not 5.16. Wait, the problem text in 5.16 says \"if k is algebraically closed\" for the geometrical interpretation. So that's part of the assumption for that specific part of 5.16.\n\nBut in the original problem description, the user is trying to do the second part of 5.16 without using 5.17. The key assumptions here would be:\n\n- k is an algebraically closed field.\n- X is an affine algebraic variety in k^n.\n- The coordinate ring A of X is non-zero (so A ≠ 0).\n- A is a finitely generated k-algebra.\n- Using Exercise 5.2, which allows extending homomorphisms from integral extensions.\n\nWait, the problem's exact statement is: \"if k is algebraically closed and X is an affine algebraic variety in k^n with coordinate ring A ≠ 0, then there exists a linear subspace L of dimension r in k^n and a linear mapping of k^n onto L which maps X onto L.\"\n\nSo, the assumptions here are:\n\n1. k is an algebraically closed field.\n2. X is an affine algebraic variety in k^n.\n3. The coordinate ring A of X is non-zero (A ≠ 0).\n4. k is infinite (since in 5.16, they assume k is infinite, as per the problem statement: \"We shall assume that k is infinite\").\n\nAdditionally, from the Noether normalization part, we know that there are y1,...,yr in A that are algebraically independent over k, and A is integral over k[y1,...,yr]. Moreover, these yi are linear combinations of the coordinate functions x1,...,xn. The linear map is constructed from these yi.\n\nSo, to structure this:\n\nAssumptions:\n- k is an infinite field.\n- k is algebraically closed.\n- X is an affine algebraic variety in k^n.\n- The coordinate ring A of X is non-zero.\n- A is a finitely generated k-algebra.\n- y1,...,yr ∈ A are algebraically independent over k and A is integral over k[y1,...,yr].\n- Each yi is a linear combination of the coordinate functions x1,...,xn of X.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a linear subspace L of dimension r in k^n and a linear mapping k^n → L that maps X onto L.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement says \"linear subspace L of dimension r in k^n and a linear mapping of k^n onto L which maps X onto L\". The key is that the linear map is surjective onto L, and X is mapped onto L.\n\nBut the assumptions need to be broken down into individual lines, each addressing one property. Let's see:\n\n- k is an infinite field.\n- k is algebraically closed.\n- X is an affine algebraic variety in k^n.\n- The coordinate ring A of X is non-zero.\n- A is a finitely generated k-algebra.\n- There exist elements y1,...,yr ∈ A that are algebraically independent over k.\n- A is integral over k[y1,...,yr].\n- Each yi is a linear combination of the coordinate functions x1,...,xn of X.\n- (Possibly: The linear map k^n → k^r is defined by the coefficients of the linear combinations yi.)\n\nBut perhaps some of these are part of the problem's given conditions. The problem's exact statement from the book is: \"if k is algebraically closed and X is an affine algebraic variety in k^n with coordinate ring A ≠ 0, then there exists a linear subspace L of dimension r in k^n and a linear mapping of k^n onto L which maps X onto L.\"\n\nSo, the key assumptions for the problem are:\n\n- k is an algebraically closed field.\n- X is an affine algebraic variety in k^n.\n- The coordinate ring A of X is non-zero.\n- k is infinite (since the first part of 5.16 assumes k is infinite for the Noether normalization to hold with linear combinations).\n\nAdditionally, since the problem is part of 5.16, which already uses the Noether normalization lemma (which requires k to be infinite), we can include that.\n\nSo, structuring:\n\nAssumption:\n- k is an infinite field.\n- k is algebraically closed.\n- X is an affine algebraic variety in k^n.\n- The coordinate ring A of X is non-zero.\n- A is a finitely generated k-algebra.\n- y1, ..., yr ∈ A are algebraically independent over k.\n- A is integral over k[y1, ..., yr].\n- Each yi is a linear combination of the coordinate functions x1, ..., xn of X.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a linear subspace L of dimension r in k^n and a linear mapping k^n → L that maps X onto L.\n\nBut perhaps some of these assumptions are redundant or can be combined. For example, being an affine algebraic variety in k^n with coordinate ring A ≠0 implies that A is a finitely generated k-algebra. Also, since the problem is part of 5.16, the Noether normalization conditions (y1,...,yr integral over, etc.) are given by the first part of the exercise.\n\nBut according to the user's problem statement, the original problem in 5.16's second part is: geometrical interpretation when k is algebraically closed, using Exercise 2 (5.2). So the key assumptions are:\n\n- k is an infinite field.\n- k is algebraically closed.\n- X is an affine algebraic variety in k^n with coordinate ring A ≠ 0.\n- A is integral over a polynomial ring k[y1,...,yr] where each yi is a linear combination of coordinate functions.\n- Exercise 5.2 is available: extending homomorphisms from integral extensions.\n\nWait, Exercise 5.2 is mentioned as a hint (\"[Use Exercise 2]\"). So the problem expects the use of Exercise 5.2, which allows extending homomorphisms. Therefore, the assumptions would include that B (the coordinate ring A) is integral over A' (the polynomial ring), and A' is a subring of A.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the assumptions should list the conditions given in the problem, and the problem is to show the existence of the linear map.\n\nBut perhaps to avoid redundancy, focus on the main assumptions:\n\n- k is an infinite field.\n- k is algebraically closed.\n- X is an affine algebraic variety in k^n with coordinate ring A ≠ 0.\n- A is integral over a polynomial ring k[y1,...,yr], where each yi is a linear combination of the coordinate functions of X.\n\nProblem: Prove there exists a linear subspace L of dimension r in k^n and a linear map k^n → L that maps X onto L.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is part of 5.16 and the user is referencing the book's exact wording, the assumptions would be:\n\n- k is an infinite field (from the first part of 5.16).\n- k is algebraically closed (as specified in the geometrical interpretation part).\n- X is an affine algebraic variety in k^n with coordinate ring A ≠ 0.\n- A is a finitely generated k-algebra (since coordinate rings are finitely generated).\n\nThe key is to extract each assumption as a separate line, each addressing one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- k is an infinite field.\n- k is algebraically closed.\n- X is an affine algebraic variety in k^n.\n- The coordinate ring A of X is non-zero.\n- A is a finitely generated k-algebra.\n- A is integral over a polynomial ring k[y1, ..., yr].\n- Each yi ∈ A is a linear combination of the coordinate functions x1, ..., xn of X.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a linear subspace L of dimension r in k^n and a linear mapping k^n → L that maps X onto L.\n\nThat seems to capture all the necessary conditions. Each line is a single assumption about one object or property. The problem is then the desired statement to prove.",
