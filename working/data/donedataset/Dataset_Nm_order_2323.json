    "AcceptedAnswer": "To expand on David's comment, since the question he links to is not the same one that you ask: a theorem of Pitt (which is mentioned in the question Linked to) tells us that when $1\\leq p < q <\\infty$, every bounded linear map from $\\ell^q$ to $\\ell^p$ is compact. In particular, since the only Banach spaces with compact unit ball are finite-dimensional, there can be no bounded linear bijection between the two spaces. Showing that naturally occurring Banach spaces are non-isomorphic can be surprisingly difficult; I don't know a simpler approach in this case, although one could probably rig up a direct argument by using ingredients from the proof of Pitt's theorem. More information and some other non_-isomorphism results can be found in a MathOverflow answer of Bill Johnson.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows how to extract assumptions and restate the problem.\n\nThe original question is about proving that the spaces ℓ_p and ℓ_q are not isomorphic when p ≠ q. The title is \"How do you prove that ℓ_p is not isomorphic to ℓ_q?\" and the question body mentions 1 ≤ p, q < ∞ with p ≠ q.\n\nFirst, I need to list all assumptions. The example had two assumptions: one about n being an integer and another about divisibility by 7. Here, the assumptions would relate to the conditions given in the problem. \n\nLooking at the problem, the key conditions are:\n1. The spaces considered are ℓ_p and ℓ_q.\n2. The exponents p and q are in the range [1, ∞).\n3. p is not equal to q.\n\nEach assumption should address one property applied to one object. So breaking it down:\n\n- First, specify the spaces: ℓ_p and ℓ_q. But the problem is about these spaces in general, so maybe state that they are considered as Banach spaces or sequence spaces. Wait, the original problem doesn't specify the exact structure beyond being ℓ_p and ℓ_q. The standard assumption is that they are sequence spaces with their usual norms. But the user's example didn't add extra structure unless given. So maybe the assumptions here are:\n\n1. 1 ≤ p < ∞\n2. 1 ≤ q < ∞\n3. p ≠ q\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption, each applied to p and q respectively. So each line is one property for one object. Then the problem is to prove that ℓ_p and ℓ_q are not isomorphic under these conditions.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have three assumptions: p in [1, ∞), q in [1, ∞), and p ≠ q. Then the problem is to prove they're not isomorphic.\n\nLet me check the example again. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. But in the original problem, the user wrote \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem included \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, maybe the example had a mistake? Because in the original problem, it's for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. Hmm, maybe the user made a mistake in their example. But regardless, I have to follow their format.\n\nIn their example, they split the assumptions into separate lines, each addressing one property. So for the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- 1 ≤ p < ∞\n- 1 ≤ q < ∞\n- p ≠ q\n\nEach on its own line. Then the problem is to prove ℓ_p and ℓ_q are not isomorphic.\n\nYes, that seems right. The original question states \"for all 1 ≤ p,q < ∞, such that p ≠ q\", so those are the conditions. Each condition is separate, so each becomes an assumption.",
