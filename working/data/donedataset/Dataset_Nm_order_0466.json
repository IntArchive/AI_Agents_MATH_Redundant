    "Content": "The statement is simply that the sequence $\\left(1+\\frac{1}{n}\\right)^n$ is increasing. Since the numbers $n^m$ have quite natural combinatorial interpretations, it makes me wonder if a combinatorial proof exists, but I haven't been able to find one. For example, if we let $S_{n,m}$ denote the set of function $\\{1, \\dots, n\\} \\to \\{1, \\dots, m\\}$, then a proof would follow from the construction of an injection $S_{2n+1,n+1} \\hookrightarrow S_{n, n} \\times S_{n+1,n+2} $, or of a surjection going the other way.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I managed to come up with a combinatorial proof of the statement in t.b.'s comment. I would guess a similar argument solves the original problem. Anyway, let $n$ be a positive integer. We will prove that\n$$ n^{2n+1} > (n-1)^n(n+1)^{n+1}.$$\nAfter multiplying by through by $n$ and performing some trivial (though slightly arcane) manipulations, we see this is equivalent to proving\n$$(n^2)^{n+1} > (n^2-1)^{n+1} + (n+1) \\cdot (n^2-1)^n.$$\nNow for the combinatorics (see problem statement for notation). The LHS counts the functions in $S_{n+1,n^2}$. The RHS counts only the functions in $S_{n+1,n^2}$ which do not take the value $1$ (via the first term) or else take the value $1$ exactly once (via the second term). And, well, that's it!! Added: Okay I think I figured out how to do the original problem in the same sort of way. The combinatorial step is a bit clumsier for some reason. Maybe someone else can see a better way? As before, let $n$ be a positive integer. We will prove that\n$$(n-1)^{n-1}(n+1)^n > n^{2n-1}.$$\nMultiplying through by $n-1$, this becomes\n$$(n^2 -1)^n > (n^2)^n - n \\cdot (n^2)^{n-1}$$\nor, equivalently,\n$$(n^2 -1)^n + n \\cdot (n^2)^{n-1} > (n^2)^n.$$\nThis last bound can be proven combinatorially. On the RHS we have all the functions in $S_{n,n^2}$. The first term on the LHS counts the functions in $S_{n,n^2}$ which never take the value $1$. Let $S$ be the set of functions in $S_{n,n^2}$ which do take the value $1$. We need to prove $S$ has less than $n \\cdot (n^2)^{n-1}$ elements. We can inject $S$ into $\\{1,\\ldots,n\\} \\times S_{n-1,n^2}$ by sending $f \\in S$ to the pair $(x,f_x)$ where $x$ is the smallest member of $\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}$ with $f(x) = 1$, and $f_x$ is obtained from $f$ by \"skipping\" over $x$ (in order to get a function with one less element in the domain). In order to see the inequality is strict, note that (I think maybe assuming $n \\geq 2$) $(n,1)$ is not in the range of this injection (here $1$ is the constant function). This completes the proof.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the given problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified structure. The example they provided shows that the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object, and then the problem statement is given.\n\nLooking at the original question on Math Stack Exchange, the title is \"A combinatorial proof of n^n(n+2)^{n+1} > (n+1)^{2n+1}?\" and the user mentions that the sequence (1 + 1/n)^n is increasing. They speculate about a combinatorial proof involving injections or surjections between sets of functions.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the key assumptions and the problem. The inequality to prove is n^n(n+2)^{n+1} > (n+1)^{2n+1}. The user is asking for a combinatorial proof, but the core problem is to prove this inequality. However, the original problem statement might have some context that needs to be filtered.\n\nWait, the user also mentions that the sequence (1 + 1/n)^n is increasing. They relate this to the inequality. So perhaps the problem is to prove that inequality as part of showing the sequence is increasing. But the main question is about the combinatorial proof for the inequality. The assumptions would be about n being a positive integer, perhaps. But in the example given, the assumption was \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, the problem is to prove an inequality for all integers n (assuming n is a positive integer, maybe). \n\nBut the user hasn't specified any particular constraints on n in the question. The original problem's title is the inequality, and the user is asking if there's a combinatorial proof. So the problem is to prove that n^n(n+2)^{n+1} > (n+1)^{2n+1}, possibly for all positive integers n. The assumptions would be that n is a positive integer. However, the example given had two assumptions, but here maybe only one is needed. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem's assumptions were \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the original problem, it was for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, maybe the example is different. Wait, perhaps there was a mistake. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect. Wait, no, maybe the user in the example made a mistake. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\", which would restrict n. That seems contradictory. Maybe the example is wrong, but the user provided it as their own example.\n\nBut regardless, following the user's example, they listed assumptions line by line. So for the current problem, the main assumption is that n is a positive integer. Because the inequality is about n, and combinatorial interpretations usually involve positive integers. Also, the user mentions sets like S_{n,m} which require n and m to be positive integers. So the assumption here is that n is a positive integer.\n\nThe problem statement is to prove that n^n(n+2)^{n+1} > (n+1)^{2n+1}. The original question also mentions the sequence (1 + 1/n)^n is increasing, but the user is focusing on the inequality. So the formatted problem should list the assumption that n is a positive integer, and the problem is to prove the inequality.\n\nWait, but the example had two assumptions. Maybe in some cases, there are multiple assumptions. But here, perhaps only one. Let me check again. The problem is to prove the inequality, and the user is looking for a combinatorial proof. The key assumption is that n is a positive integer. No other conditions are mentioned. So in the formatted problem, the assumption is \"n is a positive integer\", and the problem is to prove the inequality. Alternatively, maybe n is a natural number (i.e., starting from 1). But the problem might hold for n ≥ some value, but the user hasn't specified. However, since the context is combinatorial, n is likely a positive integer.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nAssumption: n is a positive integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that n^n(n+2)^{n+1} > (n+1)^{2n+1}.\n\nBut wait, the original title uses n^n(n+2)^{n+1} > (n+1)^{2n+1}. The user is asking if a combinatorial proof exists for this inequality, given that the sequence (1 + 1/n)^n is increasing. So the core problem is that inequality. Therefore, the formatted problem should capture that.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the assumption is n is a positive integer, and the problem is to prove the inequality. The example had two assumptions, but in this case, only one is needed. So the answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$n$ is a positive integer.\nProblem: \nProve that $n^n(n+2)^{n+1} > (n+1)^{2n+1}$.\n###",
