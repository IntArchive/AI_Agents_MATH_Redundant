    "Content": "Playing with a pencil and paper notebook I noticed the following: $x=1$ $x^3=1$ $x=2$ $x^3=8$ $x=3$ $x^3=27$ $x=4$ $x^3=64$ $64-27 = 37$ $27-8 = 19$ $8-1 = 7$ $19-7=12$ $37-19=18$ $18-12=6$ I noticed a pattern for first 1..10 (in the above example I just compute the first 3 exponents) exponent values, where the difference is always 6 for increasing exponentials. So to compute $x^3$ for $x=5$, instead of $5\\times 5\\times 5$, use $(18+6)+37+64 = 125$. I doubt I've discovered something new, but is there a name for calculating exponents in this way? Is there a proof that it works for all numbers? There is a similar less complicated pattern for computing $x^2$ values.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "It's not something new, but for your discovery I applaud. This procedure is called the method of successive differences, and you can show that for every power the successive difference appears. Let us say you have a sequence:\n$$\n1^3 \\quad2^3\\quad 3^3\\quad 4^3\\quad \\ldots\n$$ Note that $x^3-(x-1)^3 = 3x^2-3x+1$. So we'll get a new sequence at the bottom:\n$$\n7 \\quad 19\\quad 37\\quad 61\\quad \\ldots\n$$\nNow, note that $3x^2-3x+1-(3(x-1)^2-3(x-1)+1) = 6(x-1)$. Hence, we'll get another series:\n$$\n0 \\quad6\\quad 12\\quad 18\\quad\\ldots \n$$\nNow, note that $6(x-1)-6((x-1)-1) = 6$!\nNow, the new sequence is:\n$$\n6\\quad 6\\quad 6\\quad 6\\quad 6\\quad ...\n$$\nSo $6$ appears as the final difference! This shows the power of algebra. As an exercise, do this for $x^4$. See the pattern of the number at the end, and if you can say  something for $x^n$. The reason, as you can see, is that at each line above, the degree of the polynomial $f(x)-f(x-1)$ decreases by $1$. Hence, at the end of three lines, you are only going to get a constant polynomial.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The user provided an example where they extracted assumptions and the problem statement from an original question. Now, I need to apply that to the new question from Math Stack Exchange titled \"Is this a new method for finding powers?\".\n\nFirst, I'll read through the original question carefully. The user describes a method for computing cubes of numbers by looking at differences between consecutive cubes. They noticed that starting from x=1 to x=4, the differences of differences eventually lead to a constant value of 6. Then, they use this pattern to compute x=5's cube by adding 6 to the previous difference and summing up the results. They ask if this method has a name, if there's a proof it works for all numbers, and mention a similar pattern for squares.\n\nNow, the task is to list the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then, state the problem clearly.\n\nLooking at the example provided earlier, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the key assumptions would be related to the method described. Let's see:\n\n1. The method involves calculating cubes by taking successive differences. The user noticed that the third differences (differences of differences of differences) for the sequence of cubes become constant at 6. For example, the cubes of 1, 2, 3, 4 are 1, 8, 27, 64. The first differences are 7, 19, 37. The second differences are 12, 18. The third difference is 6. Then, to compute the next cube, they add another 6 to get the next second difference (18+6=24), add that to the last first difference (37+24=61), and then add to the last cube (64+61=125). \n\n2. The user assumes that this pattern of the third difference being constant (6) continues for all numbers. So, one assumption is that the third differences of the sequence of cubes are constant and equal to 6.\n\n3. Another assumption might be that this method can be generalized to compute x^3 for any x by continuing this difference approach.\n\nHowever, the original problem doesn't explicitly state these as assumptions but rather describes the observed pattern. So, in the context of the format, we need to extract the implicit assumptions from the problem description.\n\nPossible assumptions:\n\n- The third difference of the sequence of cubes (x³ for x = 1, 2, 3, ...) is a constant value of 6.\n- The method of using successive differences to compute x³ works for all positive integers x.\n\nBut since the example given in the problem only shows up to x=5 and mentions the first 1..10 exponents, but the method is claimed to work for all numbers, the key assumptions here are about the constancy of the third differences and the applicability of the method universally.\n\nHowever, in the example provided by the user, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions are not about constraints on the variables but about the properties of the sequence of cubes and the difference method.\n\nTherefore, structuring this:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The sequence of cubes (x³) for x = 1, 2, 3, ... has a constant third difference of 6.\n- The method of calculating x³ using successive differences works for all positive integers x.\n\nProblem:\nDetermine if the described method for computing x³ using successive differences, where the third difference is constant and equal to 6, is a known method, and prove whether it works for all positive integers x.\n\nBut wait, the original problem also asks if there's a name for this method and if it works for all numbers. So the problem part should encapsulate both questions.\n\nBut according to the format, the problem is a single statement. So perhaps:\n\nProblem:\nIs there a name for the method of computing cubes using successive differences with a constant third difference of 6, and does this method work for all positive integers?\n\nAlternatively, combining the two questions into one problem statement.\n\nWait, the example given by the user had a problem statement that was a single imperative sentence (\"Prove that...\"). Here, the original question has two parts: asking for the name of the method and whether there's a proof it works. But according to the example, perhaps the problem should be phrased as a statement to be proven or answered. However, the example transformed the original question into a \"Prove that...\" statement. In this case, the original question is more of an inquiry about the existence of a name and a proof. \n\nBut since the user wants to structure the problem in the given format, perhaps focusing on the core mathematical problem. The key mathematical question here is whether the method works for all numbers, which relates to the properties of finite differences in sequences. The method relies on the fact that the third differences of the cubic sequence are constant, which is a known result in finite difference calculus. For polynomials of degree n, the (n+1)th differences are zero, and the nth differences are constant. Since x³ is a cubic polynomial, the third differences should be constant, specifically 6 (which is 3! = 6). Therefore, the method is based on that property.\n\nSo the problem can be framed as asking whether this difference method (with third differences of 6) works for all numbers, which is equivalent to proving that the third differences of the sequence x³ are constant and equal to 6 for all positive integers x.\n\nTherefore, structuring it:\n\nAssumption:\n- The third finite difference of the sequence x³ for positive integers x is constant and equal to 6.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the method of computing x³ using successive finite differences, where the third difference is 6, works for all positive integers x.\n\nBut the original question also asks if there's a name for this method. However, the example provided by the user included only the problem statement related to the proof. Since the original example filtered out the part about divisibility by 91 and structured it, perhaps here, the core problem is the proof part, while the naming part might be considered as additional but not part of the structured problem. But the user's example included the problem as in the original, but rephrased.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem had \"Prove that for every integer n... divisible by 91.\" The user rephrased the assumptions (n is integer, n divisible by 7) and the problem as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" So they extracted the key conditions and the core problem.\n\nIn the current case, the original problem is asking two things: is there a name, and is there a proof. But the example format seems to take the problem as a single statement to prove. However, the user's example problem had a single proof statement, but here, the original problem has two questions. So perhaps the problem part should include both, but maybe in the context of the structured format, the assumptions are about the method's properties, and the problem is to determine if it's known and valid.\n\nBut since the user's example focused on the proof part, maybe here the problem is to prove that the method works for all numbers, which in turn would address the second part of the question. The naming part might be considered as a separate question but perhaps not part of the mathematical problem to be structured here. Alternatively, the problem could be phrased as asking both.\n\nBut following the example's structure, which focused on the proof, perhaps the problem here is to prove that the method works for all positive integers x. The question about the name is more about terminology, which might not be part of the mathematical problem per se but still part of the original question. However, the user's instructions say to structure the problem in the given format, filtering unrelated information. The example filtered out the original problem's mention of \"for every integer n\" but added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was actually not in the original problem. Wait, looking back, the original example was:\n\nOriginal problem:\nProve that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be a mistake. Wait, perhaps the user in the example made an error. Wait, the original problem in the example was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which changes the problem. That seems like a mistake. Because 91 is 7*13. If the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, then perhaps the correct assumptions are not that n is divisible by 7, but that the expression is divisible by 7 and 13 for all n, hence 91. But the formatted problem in the example seems to have incorrectly added assumptions. Maybe that example was a mistake, but it's the user's example, so we have to follow their structure.\n\nIn that case, perhaps in the current problem, even if the original question is about the name and the proof, the formatted problem should focus on the proof part, with assumptions related to the method's conditions.\n\nTherefore, the key assumptions here are that the third differences are constant (6), and the problem is to prove that this method works for all positive integers x. The question about the name is ancillary and can be omitted in the structured problem, focusing on the mathematical core.\n\nThus:\n\nAssumption:\n- The third finite difference of the sequence x³ for positive integers x is constant and equal to 6.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the method of computing x³ using successive finite differences with a constant third difference of 6 works for all positive integers x.\n\nAlternatively, since the method is described as using the differences to compute subsequent cubes, the problem is to prove that this method correctly calculates x³ for all positive integers x.\n\nBut maybe more precisely, the problem is to show that the method based on finite differences with a constant third difference of 6 correctly computes the cube of any positive integer x.\n\nAlternatively, since the user's example took the original problem and rephrased it, perhaps here the problem is to ask whether the method works for all numbers, which is the second part of the original question.\n\nBut the example included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (n divisible by 7), which might have been a mistake, but following that, here we need to list the assumptions implicit in the problem.\n\nThe method relies on the fact that the third differences are constant and equal to 6. Therefore, the assumption is that this holds for all x, and the problem is to prove that the method works (i.e., computes x³ correctly) for all x.\n\nBut actually, the constancy of the third difference is a mathematical fact for cubic polynomials. For a sequence generated by a cubic polynomial, the third differences are constant and equal to 6 times the leading coefficient. Since x³ has a leading coefficient of 1, the third differences should be 3! = 6. Therefore, the assumption here is inherent to the sequence x³, so the problem is to prove that the method of finite differences with third difference 6 correctly computes x³ for all positive integers x.\n\nTherefore, the structured problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n- The third finite difference of the sequence x³ is constant and equal to 6 for all positive integers x.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the method of computing x³ using successive finite differences with a constant third difference of 6 works for all positive integers x.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the method's validity depends on the third differences being 6, which is a known result, perhaps the problem is to prove that using this method allows correct computation of x³ for all positive integers x.\n\nBut given that the user's example included assumptions that may not have been explicitly stated in the original problem, here the key is to extract the necessary conditions. However, in the original problem, the user didn't state any assumptions; they just described their observation and asked if it's valid. Therefore, the assumptions here would be the conditions under which their method works, which are the properties of the sequence of cubes.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- The sequence of cubes (x³) for x = 1, 2, 3, ... has third finite differences equal to 6.\n- The method of extending the sequence using these constant third differences accurately computes subsequent cubes.\n\nBut since the method is based on the third differences being 6, the key assumption is the first one. However, in the example, the assumption was about the variable (n being an integer and divisible by 7). Here, the variable x is a positive integer, so maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n- x is a positive integer.\n\nBut that's already given in the problem. Alternatively, since the method uses differences starting from x=1 upwards, the assumptions could be:\n\n- The initial values x³ for x = 1, 2, 3, 4 are correct.\n- The third finite difference of the sequence is constant and equal to 6.\n\nBut the original problem's method uses the differences starting from known cubes (1, 8, 27, 64) and then computes the next cube using the differences. So the method's correctness relies on the third differences remaining constant, which is a property of polynomial sequences.\n\nThus, the structured problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\n- The third finite difference of the sequence x³ for positive integers x is constant and equal to 6.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the method of calculating x³ by extending the sequence using successive finite differences with a constant third difference of 6 works for all positive integers x.\n\nAlternatively, given that the example included assumptions about the variable (n being integer and divisible by 7), perhaps here the assumption is just that x is a positive integer, and the problem is to prove the method works. But given the context, the key mathematical assumption here is the constancy of the third difference.\n\nHowever, in the example, the user added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (n divisible by 7), which might have been an error. If we follow strictly the original problem, the formatted problem should list the assumptions inherent in the problem statement.\n\nBut in the original problem here, the user is asking whether the method works for all numbers, assuming that the pattern they observed (third difference 6) continues. Therefore, the assumption is that the third differences remain 6 for all x, and the problem is to prove that under this assumption, the method correctly computes x³.\n\nBut in reality, the third differences being 6 is a theorem, not an assumption. So perhaps the problem is to prove that for the sequence x³, the third differences are constant and equal to 6, and that using this property allows accurate computation of x³ for all positive integers x.\n\nHowever, the original question is more about the method's validity rather than proving the constancy of the third differences. So maybe the problem is to prove that the method of using finite differences with third difference 6 correctly computes x³ for all positive integers x, which would inherently involve showing that the third differences are indeed 6.\n\nBut given the example's structure, perhaps the assumptions should include the conditions on the sequence, and the problem is to prove the method works.\n\nIn conclusion, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The third finite difference of the cubic number sequence is constant and equal to 6.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the method of computing x³ using successive finite differences with a constant third difference of 6 works for all positive integers x.\n\nAlternatively, if we take the original question's exact wording, the problem is two-fold: asking for the name and the proof. But since the example focused on the proof part, perhaps here we structure it as proving the method works, with the assumption being the constancy of the third difference.",
