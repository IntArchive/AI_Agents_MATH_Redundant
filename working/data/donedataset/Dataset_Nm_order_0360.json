    "Content": "Given real numbers $a_0, a_1, ..., a_n$ such that $\\dfrac {a_0}{1} + \\dfrac {a_1}{2} + \\cdots + \\dfrac {a_n}{n+1}=0,$ prove that $a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \\cdots + a_n x^n=0$ has at least one real solution. My solution: Let $$f(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \\cdots + a_n x^n$$ $$\\int f(x) = \\dfrac {a_0}{1} x + \\dfrac {a_1}{2}x^2 + \\cdots + \\dfrac {a_n}{n+1} x^{n+1} + C$$ $$\\int_0^1 f(x) = \\left[ \\dfrac {a_0}{1} + \\dfrac {a_1}{2} + \\cdots + \\dfrac {a_n}{n+1} \\right]-0$$ $$\\int_0^1 f(x) = 0$$ Since $f$ is continuous, by the area interpretation of integration, it must have at least one zero. My question is, is this rigorous enough? Do I need to prove the last statement, perhaps by contradiction using Riemann sums? Is this a theorem I can/should quote?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Why not write it the other way round? The polynomial function \n$$F(x)=\\sum_{k=0}^n\\frac{a_k}{k+1}x^{k+1} $$\nis a differentiable function $\\Bbb R\\to\\Bbb R$ with derivative $$F'(x)=\\sum_{k=0}^na_kx^k.$$\nWe are given that $F(1)=0$, and clearly $F(0)=0$. Hence by Rolle's theorem , there exists $x\\in(0,1)$ such that $F'(x)=0$, as was to be shown.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The original problem states: Given real numbers a0, a1, ..., an such that the sum a0/1 + a1/2 + ... + an/(n+1) equals zero. We need to prove that the polynomial a0 + a1x + ... + an x^n has at least one real root.\n\nSo, the assumptions here are about the coefficients a0 to an being real numbers and their weighted sum equaling zero. Each assumption should be listed separately. Let me parse that.\n\nAssumption 1: Each ai (from a0 to an) is a real number. That's one condition applied to the coefficients.\n\nAssumption 2: The sum a0/1 + a1/2 + ... + an/(n+1) equals zero. That's another condition, applied to the same coefficients but specifying the equation they satisfy.\n\nThen the problem is to prove the polynomial has at least one real solution. \n\nWait, in the example provided, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". But in the example, the user restructured the problem with an additional assumption. However, in this current problem, the original assumptions are already given: the coefficients are real and their weighted sum is zero. So I don't need to add any extra assumptions beyond what's stated.\n\nSo the formatted assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption: \na0, a1, ..., an are real numbers,\n(a0)/1 + (a1)/2 + ... + (a_n)/(n+1) = 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that the equation a0 + a1x + ... + a_n x^n = 0 has at least one real solution.\n\nWait, but in the original example, they split each assumption into separate lines. So each bullet point is one assumption. Here, the first assumption is that all coefficients are real numbers. The second is the sum equals zero. Each of these should be separate lines under Assumption.\n\nTherefore, the structured problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\na_0, a_1, ..., a_n are real numbers,\n(a_0)/1 + (a_1)/2 + ... + (a_n)/(n+1) = 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that the equation a_0 + a_1 x + ... + a_n x^n = 0 has at least one real solution.\n\nI need to ensure that each assumption is a single line. The first line states the coefficients are real, the second line states the integral-like sum equals zero. The problem is as stated. The user's example included multiple assumptions, each on their own line, so this should follow that.\n\nYes, that looks correct. The original problem doesn't mention any other conditions, so those are the only assumptions. The problem is to prove existence of a real root. Therefore, the formatted version should be as above.",
