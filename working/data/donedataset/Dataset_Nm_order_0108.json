    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure the given problem from Math Stack Exchange. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the problem into their specified structure, which includes listing assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nFirst, the original problem is about proving that the set S = {m + n√2 | m, n ∈ ℤ} is dense in ℝ. Specifically, the question asks to show that for every ε > 0, the intersection of S with the interval (0, ε) is nonempty. The user provided an example where they listed assumptions and the problem. \n\nLooking at the example, the assumptions were about the properties of n (being an integer and divisible by 7). In the current problem, we need to identify the assumptions. The set S is defined with m and n as integers. So the assumptions would be about the elements of S: each element is of the form m + n√2 where m and n are integers. Also, the problem statement is to show that for any positive ε, there's an element of S in (0, ε). \n\nWait, but in the example, they included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the original problem's conditions. Here, the original problem states \"for every ε > 0\", so the ε is arbitrary positive real. The conditions on S are that m and n are integers. So the assumptions should list the properties of S's elements. Each element is m + n√2 with m,n integers. So each assumption line should address one property. Since m and n are both integers, but they are separate variables, maybe each can be an assumption. But the example had two lines: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Here, the problem doesn't have additional conditions like divisibility, just m and n being integers. So perhaps two assumptions: m is an integer, and n is an integer. But the problem defines S as m + n√2 where m and n are integers. So each element of S is built from two integers. Therefore, the assumptions should be about the structure of S's elements.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7, which were part of the problem's conditions. In the current problem, the problem statement is to prove that S is dense in ℝ by showing that in any interval (0, ε) there's an element of S. The assumptions are the definitions of S: the elements are of the form m + n√2 with m, n integers. So each element is a combination of integers and √2. Therefore, the assumptions here are that m and n are integers. But how to split them? The example had two lines for assumptions, each addressing one property. So here, perhaps two assumptions: \"m is an integer\" and \"n is an integer\". Alternatively, since the elements are m + n√2, maybe one assumption per variable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem doesn't have any additional assumptions beyond the definition of S, so the assumptions are the structure of S. Wait, but the problem is to prove that S intersects every (0, ε). So the problem's assumptions are the definition of S. Therefore, in the Assumption section, we need to list each condition that defines S. Since S is defined as {m + n√2 | m, n ∈ ℤ}, each element is built from two integers. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- m is an integer,\n- n is an integer,\n- S consists of numbers of the form m + n√2.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumptions were about the variable in the problem. The original example's problem was about A(n) where n is an integer, and the assumptions listed that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, the problem is about the set S, so the assumptions would be the properties of S. Since S is defined using m and n as integers, the assumptions would be that m and n are integers. But the problem statement itself is to show density, which is about the intersection with any interval. So the user's format requires listing all the assumptions, each as a single line addressing one property of one object. \n\nSo perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nm is an integer,\nn is an integer,\nS is the set of numbers m + n√2 where m and n are integers.\n\nProblem:\nProve that for every ε > 0, the intersection of S and (0, ε) is nonempty.\n\nBut wait, in the example, they didn't restate the definition of A(n), but just listed the assumptions on n. Here, maybe the definition of S is part of the problem statement, but the assumptions are the conditions on m and n. Alternatively, perhaps the problem statement includes the definition of S, and the assumptions are that m and n are integers. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted problem listed the assumptions as n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Then the problem statement restated A(n)'s formula and the goal. So the assumptions are the conditions on the variables involved. So in the current problem, the variables m and n are integers, so each should be listed as an assumption. The set S is defined based on those m and n. Therefore, the assumptions are that m and n are integers, and the problem is to prove that S intersects every (0, ε). But the problem statement itself should restate S's definition. Wait, in the example, they included the formula for A(n) in the problem statement. Similarly, here, the problem statement should include the definition of S. But according to the user's example, the problem part can include mathematical expressions. So maybe the problem statement is: Prove that for every ε > 0, the intersection of S = {m + n√2 | m, n ∈ ℤ} and (0, ε) is nonempty. But the assumptions would then just be that m and n are integers. However, in the example, the assumptions included the conditions on n, even though the problem statement also mentions n. So the key is to list all the underlying assumptions that are given in the problem. Since the problem defines S as m + n√2 with m, n integers, the assumptions are that m and n are integers. The problem statement then is to prove the density condition. So the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nm is an integer,\nn is an integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that for every ε > 0, the intersection of S = {m + n√2 | m, n ∈ ℤ} and (0, ε) is nonempty.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the problem statement included the formula for A(n), even though the assumptions already stated n's properties. So here, the problem statement should include S's definition, even though the assumptions list that m and n are integers. Alternatively, perhaps the problem statement can just refer to S as defined, but the user's example shows that the problem statement includes the formula. Therefore, to follow the example, we should include S's definition in the problem statement. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nm is an integer,\nn is an integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that for every ε > 0, the intersection of S = {m + n√2 | m, n ∈ ℤ} and (0, ε) is nonempty.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions should include that S is the set of m + n√2 for integers m, n. But in the example, the assumptions were about the variable in the problem (n being integer and divisible by 7), not about the structure of the function. Hmm. Let me think again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, where A(n) is defined as 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n). The formatted problem's assumptions were that n is an integer and divisible by 7. The problem statement then was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. So the function's definition was included in the problem statement, not in the assumptions. The assumptions were about the variable n's properties.\n\nFollowing that, in the current problem, S is defined as {m +n√2 | m,n ∈ ℤ}. The problem is to prove for every ε>0, the intersection of S and (0,ε) is nonempty. So the assumptions would be the properties of m and n, i.e., that they are integers. Then the problem statement includes the definition of S. So:\n\nAssumption:\nm is an integer,\nn is an integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that for every ε > 0, the intersection of S = {m + n√2 | m, n ∈ ℤ} and (0, ε) is nonempty.\n\nYes, this seems consistent with the example. Each assumption is a single property of one object (m is integer, n is integer). The problem statement includes the definition of S and the goal.",
