    "Content": "The $L^p$ norm in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is\n\\begin{align}\n\\|x\\|_p = \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{n} |x_j|^p\\right)^{1/p}.\n\\end{align}\nPlaying around with WolframAlpha, I noticed that, if we define the \"scaled\" $L^p$ norm in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ to be \\begin{align}\n\\| x \\|_p = \\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{j=1}^{n} |x_j|^p\\right)^{1/p}\n\\end{align}\nthen\n\\begin{align}\n\\lim_{p \\to 0} \\|x\\|_p &= \\left( \\prod_{j=1}^{n} |x_j| \\right)^{1/n},\n\\end{align}\nwhich is the geometric mean of the coordinates' absolute values. This is interesting maybe because the $L^p$ norm doesn't have a nice limit at zero. My questions: How do I prove this? Is this definition of \"scaled $L^p$ norm\" interesting, or known by another name, or used anywhere? Is there any interesting reason to define the $L^0$ norm as the geometric mean, as above? Further reading? Thanks!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I'll prove the general case in which $\\mu$ is a positive measure on a space $X$ and $\\mu(X) = 1$. Assuming that $\\|f\\|_q < \\infty$ for at least one $0 < q < 1$, we have\n$$\n\\lim_{p \\to 0} \\|f\\|_{p} = \\exp\\left(\\int_X \\log|f| \\,d\\mu\\right).\n$$ Your particular case follows by setting $X = \\{1, \\ldots, n\\}$ and $\\mu(i) = 1/n$. By definition\n$$\n\\|f\\|_p = \\left\\{\\int_X |f|^p \\,d\\mu\\right\\}^{1/p}.\n$$ Lemma 1: If $0 < r < s < 1$, then $\\|f\\|_r \\le \\|f\\|_s$. Proof: $\\varphi(x) = x^{s/r}$ is a convex function. Apply Jensen's inequality to $\\int_X |f|^r \\,d\\mu$ to get\n$$\n \\left\\{\\int_X |f|^r \\,d\\mu\\right\\}^{s/r} \\le \\int_X |f|^s \\,d\\mu.\n$$ Hence $\\|f\\|_r \\le \\|f\\|_s$. Lemma 2 : If $0 < p < 1$, then $\\int_X \\log|f| \\,d\\mu \\le \\log \\|f\\|_p$. Proof: $\\log$ is a concave function. Apply Jensen's inequality to $\\int_X |f|^p \\,d\\mu$ to get the desired inequality. From lemmas 1 and 2, it follows that $\\log\\|f\\|_{1/n}$ is decreasing and bounded from below. Therefore, it converges as $n \\to \\infty$. To find the limit, apply the inequality $\\log a \\le n(a^{1/n} - 1)$ with $a = \\left\\{\\int_X |f|^{1/n}\\,d\\mu\\right\\}^{n} $ to get\n$$\n\\log \\|f\\|_{1/n} \\le \\int_X \\frac{|f|^{1/n} - 1}{1/n} \\,d\\mu. \\tag{1}\n$$ Use L'Hôpital's rule to obtain\n$$\n\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{a^x - 1}{x} = \\log a.\n$$ Take the limit of (1) as $n \\to \\infty$. Since $\\dfrac{|f|^{1/n} - 1}{1/n}$ is dominated by the integrable function $\\dfrac{|f|^{q} - 1}{q}$ for large enough $n$ and the value of $q$ stated in the assumptions, apply the dominated convergence theorem to get\n$$\n\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\log \\|f\\|_{1/n} \\le \\int_X \\log|f| \\,d\\mu.\n$$ Apply the squeeze theorem with lemma 2 to obtain\n$$\n\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\log \\|f\\|_{1/n} = \\int_X \\log|f| \\,d\\mu.\n$$ Since $\\log$ is continuous, we conclude\n$$\n\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\|f\\|_{1/n} = \\exp\\left(\\int_X \\log|f| \\,d\\mu\\right).\n$$ The above argument applies to any sequence $s_n$ that converges to $0$, not just $1/n$. The general result stated at the beginning now follows. This is a standard argument in measure theory. It is usually used to apply the dominated convergence theorem to general limits, not just limits of countable sequences. To answer your other questions, the \"scaled norm\" follows from the general case as I explained at the beginning of my answer. I've never seen the geometric mean called $L^0$. As for further readings, check out Rudin's Real and Complex Analysis or Folland's Real Analysis. The above is an exercise in one of them (I think the former).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So the user is asking about the scaled L^p norm defined as (1/n times the sum of |x_j|^p) raised to 1/p, and they want to prove that the limit as p approaches 0 of this norm is the geometric mean of the absolute values of the coordinates. Also, they have some other questions about the significance of this norm, but the main task here is to structure the problem according to the given format.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions in the problem. The original question mentions the scaled L^p norm in R^n. Let's break down the components:\n\n1. The space is R^n, so we're dealing with n-dimensional real vectors.\n2. The scaled L^p norm is defined as (1/n * sum_{j=1}^n |x_j|^p)^{1/p}.\n3. The problem involves taking the limit as p approaches 0 of this scaled norm.\n4. The claim is that this limit equals the geometric mean of the coordinates' absolute values, which is (product_{j=1}^n |x_j|)^{1/n}.\n\nSo each of these points should be an assumption. Let's list them line by line, ensuring each addresses one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The vector x is in R^n.\n- The scaled L^p norm of x is defined as [(1/n) * sum_{j=1}^n |x_j|^p]^{1/p}.\n- The limit as p approaches 0 of the scaled L^p norm of x is considered.\n- The geometric mean of the absolute values of the coordinates of x is [product_{j=1}^n |x_j|]^{1/n}.\n\nWait, but the problem is to prove that the limit equals the geometric mean. The assumptions should include all given conditions. So the scaled L^p norm's definition is an assumption, the limit as p→0 is part of the problem statement. The problem is to show the equality between the limit and the geometric mean. So perhaps the assumptions are the definition of the scaled norm and the context of R^n. Let me check the example provided in the user's instruction.\n\nIn the example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. The problem was to prove the expression is divisible by 91. So the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem, not including what needs to be proved.\n\nSo here, the problem is to prove that the limit as p→0 of the scaled L^p norm equals the geometric mean. Therefore, the assumptions would include the definition of the scaled L^p norm, that x is in R^n, and maybe that all coordinates are non-zero? Wait, the geometric mean is defined as the product of |x_j| to the 1/n. If any x_j is zero, the product becomes zero. But does the original problem mention anything about x_j being non-zero? The user's question doesn't specify, but in the limit, if some x_j are zero, the product would be zero. Maybe the assumption is that x is a vector in R^n, and the scaled norm is as defined, and the problem is to take the limit as p→0, which results in the geometric mean. So perhaps there's no need to assume x_j ≠ 0 unless necessary, but maybe the problem implicitly requires x_j > 0 to avoid log issues? Wait, the limit might involve taking logarithms, so if any x_j is zero, the logarithm would be problematic. But the problem statement as given just says \"geometric mean of the coordinates' absolute values\", so even if some are zero, the geometric mean is zero, which is fine. So maybe no need to assume non-zero coordinates unless the proof requires it. However, in the context of norms, sometimes non-zero vectors are considered, but the problem doesn't specify. The user's question just says \"the coordinates' absolute values\", so perhaps the assumptions are just the vector is in R^n and the scaled norm is defined as given. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- x is a vector in R^n.\n- The scaled L^p norm of x is defined as [(1/n) * sum_{j=1}^n |x_j|^p]^{1/p}.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that the limit as p→0 of this norm equals the geometric mean. However, the problem also mentions that the geometric mean is [product |x_j|]^{1/n}. So maybe that's part of the problem statement. Wait, no. The problem states that the limit equals the geometric mean. The user is asking to prove that. So the assumptions are the definitions and the context, and the problem is the proof.\n\nTherefore, structuring:\n\nAssumption:\n- The vector x is in R^n.\n- The scaled L^p norm of x is defined as [(1/n) sum_{j=1}^n |x_j|^p]^{1/p}.\n\nProblem:\nProve that lim_{p→0} ||x||_p = (product_{j=1}^n |x_j|)^{1/n}.\n\nBut in the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, maybe the assumptions are that we're working in R^n, using the scaled L^p norm as defined, and perhaps that p is approaching 0. But since the problem is about the limit as p→0, that's part of the problem statement. So maybe the only assumptions are the vector space and the definition of the norm.\n\nAdditionally, the user might have other implicit assumptions, such as x_j ≠ 0 for all j? Because if some x_j are zero, then the product would be zero, but in the limit, the scaled norm would also approach zero. Let me test with an example. Suppose x has some zero entries. Let's say x = (0, 2, 3). Then the product is 0*2*3 = 0, so the geometric mean is 0. On the scaled norm, when p approaches 0, (1/3)(0^p + 2^p +3^p)^(1/p). As p→0, 0^p approaches 0 for p>0, but if p approaches 0 from the right, 0^p is 0. However, 2^p ≈1 + p ln 2, similarly 3^p≈1 + p ln 3. So sum is 0 + 1 + p ln 2 +1 + p ln 3 = 2 + p(ln 2 + ln 3). Then average is (2 + p(ln 2 + ln 3))/3. Then take (average)^(1/p). As p→0, this becomes (2/3 + O(p))^(1/p). The logarithm would be (1/p) ln(2/3 + O(p)) ≈ (1/p)(ln(2/3) + O(p)) ≈ ln(2/3)/p + O(1). Then exp(ln(2/3)/p + O(1)) = e^{O(1)} * (2/3)^{1/p} → 0 as p→0. So even though two entries are non-zero, the scaled norm tends to zero. But the geometric mean is zero. So in this case, the equality holds. So even with some zero entries, the limit equals the geometric mean. Therefore, no need for additional assumptions on x_j being non-zero. Hence, the assumptions are as above.\n\nThus, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n- x is a vector in R^n.\n- The scaled L^p norm of x is defined as [(1/n) sum_{j=1}^n |x_j|^p]^{1/p}.\n\nProblem:\nProve that lim_{p→0} ||x||_p equals the geometric mean (product_{j=1}^n |x_j|)^{1/n}.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user wrote the scaled norm as ||x||_p, same as the usual L^p norm symbol. But in the assumption, we have to mention that the scaled norm is defined as that. However, the problem might need to clarify that the scaled norm is the one being used, but since the problem statement already defines it, maybe that's part of the assumptions. Alternatively, maybe the assumption should include the definition of the scaled norm. Let me check the example again. In the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. The problem was to prove divisibility by 91, with the expression given. So similarly, here the assumption is that the scaled norm is defined in this way, and the problem is to prove the limit equals the geometric mean.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nThe vector $x$ is in $\\mathbb{R}^n$,\nThe scaled $L^p$ norm of $x$ is defined as $\\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} |x_j|^p \\right)^{1/p}$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\lim_{p \\to 0} \\|x\\|_p = \\left( \\prod_{j=1}^{n} |x_j| \\right)^{1/n}.$$\n###",
