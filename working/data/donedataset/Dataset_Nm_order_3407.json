    "Content": "One of my math teacher did not like proof by contradiction. He mentioned that it is a indirect way to prove something and not a genuine way to prove a statement. In elementary math class, there is a following statement: \"there is no rational number whose square is 2.\" I have only seen a proof by contradiction so far. Is there a direct proof for there is no rational number whose square is 2? Also I want to hear your opinion about proof method: proof by contradiction. Is this really bad? Should I avoid using this method whenever possible?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "As another answer indicated, proof by contradiction is really only objected to by constructivist mathematicians, who use intuitionistic logic. But typically constructivists will accept the usual proof of the irrationality of $\\sqrt 2$ . If I'm right in assuming that your professor is a constructivist, then I'd imagine that they would accept that proof. This might be confusing. As you say, the irrationality of $\\sqrt 2$ seems like a proof by contradiction, so to explain this I'll explain constructivism to the best of my knowledge first. In intuitionistic logic, one refuses the law of excluded middle: $$\nP \\vee \\neg P\n$$ which can be thought of as saying that $\\neg (\\neg P) \\iff P$ for all propositions $P$ . In case you're unfamiliar with the jargon, $\\neg$ means \"not\" and $\\vee$ means \"or.\" Now, a proof by contradiction is something of the form: $$\n\\text{Suppose } \\neg P \\text{ and derive a contradiction. Then, we must have } P.\n$$ But there is a very similar proof method called proof by negation that is constructively valid: $$\n\\text{Suppose } P \\text{ and derive a contradiction. Then, we must have } \\neg P.\n$$ These appear almost identical (and in classical logic they are identical), but the crux is that proof by contradiction uses the law of excluded middle whereas proof by negation does not. Proof by negation essentially comes from the fact that $\\neg P$ is the same as $P \\implies \\text{false}$ . This is often taken as the definition of $\\neg P$ . From this perspective, proof by negation is an application of the deductive principle that to prove $P \\implies \\text{false}$ , one can suppose $P$ and derive $\\text{false}$ . The irrationality of $\\sqrt 2$ is a proof by negation, not by contradiction. The proof I'm aware of starts with \"Suppose $\\sqrt 2 = \\frac{p}{q}$ ...\" and ends with \"...so $p$ and $q$ must both be even, which is a contradiction. Hence, $\\sqrt 2$ is irrational.\" This is a proof by negation and is therefore constructively valid. Now, as for proof by contradiction, I personally see no issue with it. I accept the law of excluded middle in my work and don't think twice about using proof by contradiction. I think the majority of mathematicians would agree with me on this. However, constructivism is a very real viewpoint and it's worth understanding it. I can't do it much justice myself, but I highly recommend an article written by Andrej Bauer entitled \"5 Stages of Accepting Constructive Mathematics.\" There are many very technical things in this article, but I think you could still learn a lot about constructivism and why (I assume) your professor dislikes proof by contradiction.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to format the Math Stack Exchange question according to the specified structure. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement from the original question.\n\nThe original question is about whether there's a direct proof for the statement that there's no rational number whose square is 2, instead of using proof by contradiction. The user also asks for opinions on proof by contradiction, but that part is probably not part of the problem statement to be formatted.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are specific conditions or properties applied to one object each. In the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. For the current problem, the main assumption is that we're dealing with rational numbers. The problem itself is to prove there's no rational number whose square is 2. \n\nBut wait, does the problem have any explicit assumptions given? The original statement is general: \"there is no rational number whose square is 2.\" The standard proof by contradiction assumes such a rational number exists (in reduced form) and then derives a contradiction. However, the question is asking for a direct proof, so maybe the assumption here is simply that we're working within rational numbers. \n\nSo, in the formatted problem, the assumption would be that we're considering a rational number. The problem is to prove that no such rational number has a square equal to 2. The rest of the user's question about opinions on proof methods is not part of the problem statement and should be filtered out.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list the assumption as \"the number is a rational number,\" and the problem is to prove that there's no such number with square 2. The other parts of the original question (teacher's opinion, request for opinions) are irrelevant and should be excluded.",
