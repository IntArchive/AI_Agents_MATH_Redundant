    "AcceptedAnswer": "UPDATED: In this previous answer I proved that (if $\\,\\operatorname{Li}$ is the polylogarithm ) :\n$$S(x):=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{H_n}{n^2}\\, x^n=\\zeta(3)+\\frac{\\ln(1-x)^2\\ln(x)}{2}+\\ln(1-x)\\operatorname{Li}_2(1-x)+\\operatorname{Li}_3(x)-\\operatorname{Li}_3(1-x)$$ Taking the limit as $x\\to 1$ and $x\\to -1$ we get :\n$$S(1)=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{H_n}{n^2}=2\\,\\zeta(3),\\quad S(-1)=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^n\\;H_n}{n^2}=-\\frac 58\\zeta(3)$$ To obtain the limit for $S(1)$ use $\\,\\operatorname{Li}_n(\\epsilon)\\sim\\epsilon\\,$ as $|\\epsilon|\\to 0\\,$ and $\\,\\operatorname{Li}_n(1)=\\zeta(n)\\,$. For $S(-1)$ the method is rather long $(*)$ so let's come back to the integral expression from my previous answer applied to $x=-1$ (using $\\displaystyle\\operatorname{Li}_3(-1)=-\\frac34\\zeta(3)$ from $(*)$) :\n\\begin{align}\n\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{H_n}{n^2}(-1)^n&=\\int_0^{-1} \\frac {\\ln(1-x)^2}{2\\,x}dx+\\operatorname{Li}_3(-1)\\\\\n&=\\int_0^1 \\frac {\\ln(1+x)^2}{2\\,x}dx-\\frac 34\\zeta(3)\\\\\n\\end{align} Integrals like $\\;\\displaystyle a_k:=\\int_0^1 \\frac {\\ln(1+x)^k}xdx\\,$ were studied by Nielsen and Ramanujan who found that $\\displaystyle a_1=\\frac{\\zeta(2)}2,\\;a_2=\\frac{\\zeta(3)}4$ so that $\\;\\displaystyle S(-1)=\\frac 12\\frac{\\zeta(3)}4-\\frac{\\zeta(3)}4=-\\frac 58\\zeta(3)$ We conclude that : \n$$S(1)+S(-1)=2\\sum_{m=1}^\\infty \\frac{H_{2m}}{(2m)^2}=2\\,\\zeta(3)-\\frac 58\\zeta(3)=\\frac {11}8\\zeta(3)$$\nand \n\\begin{align}\n\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{H_{2n+1}}{n^2}&=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{H_{2n}+\\frac 1{2n+1}}{n^2}\\\\\n&=\\frac {11}4\\zeta(3)+\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac 1{n^2(2n+1)}\\\\\n&=\\frac {11}4\\zeta(3)+\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac 1{n^2}-\\frac 4{2n}+\\frac 4{2n+1}\\\\\n&=\\frac {11}4\\zeta(3)+\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac 1{n^2}+4\\sum_{n=2}^\\infty\\frac {(-1)^{n-1}}{n}\\\\\n&=\\frac {11}4\\zeta(3)+\\zeta(2)+4(\\ln(1+1)-1)\\\\\n\\end{align} Concerning the series $\\displaystyle \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\frac{H_{2n+k}}{n^2}\\;$ we simply add individual terms (as $+\\frac 1{2n+1}$ previousy) and the same method still works : expand the remaining terms in partial fractions and evaluate the series. For $k=5$ (using computer algebra of course) I got the previously evaluated $\\; \\displaystyle\\frac {11}4\\zeta(3)+$ $$\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\frac 1{n^2}\\left(\\frac 1{2n+1}+\\frac 1{2n+2}+\\frac 1{2n+3}+\\frac 1{2n+4}+\\frac 1{2n+5}\\right)=\\\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\frac{137}{60n^2}-\\frac{5269}{1800\\,n} + \\frac 1{2(n + 1)} + \\frac 1{8(n + 2)} + \\frac 4{2n + 1} + \\frac 4{9(\n2n + 3)} + \\frac 4{25(2n + 5)}=\\\\\n\\frac{1036}{225}\\ln(2) + \\frac{137}{60}\\zeta(2) - \\frac{298373}{54000}\n$$ For $k=4$ the additional terms are $\\displaystyle +\\frac{40}9\\ln(2) + \\frac{25}{12}\\zeta(2) - \\frac{2281}{432}$ that you may compare with your result. All results obtained for $k>0$ could be written as $\\; \\displaystyle R(k)=\\frac{11}4\\zeta(3)+p_k\\,\\zeta(2)+q_k\\,\\ln(2)+r_k\\;$ for every $k>0$ with $p_k,q_k,r_k\\in\\mathbb{Q}\\,$. $(*)$ Alternative method to evaluate $S(-1)$ (complicated, left for the record only) : $\\displaystyle\\operatorname{Li}_3(-1)=-\\frac34\\zeta(3)$ from the second formula $\\;\\displaystyle\\operatorname{Li}_n(-1)=-\\left(1-\\frac 1{2^{n-1}}\\right)\\zeta(n)$ the inversion formula $\\;\\displaystyle\\operatorname{Li}_3(z)=\\operatorname{Li}_3(1/z)+2\\zeta(2)\\ln(z)-\\frac{i\\pi}2\\ln(z)^2-\\frac 16\\ln(z)^3\\;$ for $z>1$ applied to $z=2$. the formula $\\;\\displaystyle\\operatorname{Li}_3(1/2)=\\frac 78\\zeta(3)-\\frac{\\zeta(2)\\ln(2)}2+\\frac 16\\ln(2)^3\\,$ to conclude that $\\;\\displaystyle\\operatorname{Li}_3(2)=\\frac 78\\zeta(3)-\\frac{i\\pi}2\\ln(2)^2+\\frac{\\pi^2}4\\ln(2)$. the same way obtain $\\;\\displaystyle\\operatorname{Li}_2(2)=-\\frac{\\pi^2}4-\\frac12(\\ln(2)+i\\pi)^2+\\frac 12\\ln(2)^2\\;$ from $\\;\\displaystyle\\operatorname{Li}_2(z)=-\\operatorname{Li}_2(1/z)+2\\zeta(2)-i\\pi\\ln(z)-\\frac 12\\ln(z)^2\\;$ and the formula for $\\operatorname{Li}_2(1/2)$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example they provided involved listing assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object, then stating the problem.\n\nLooking at the Math Stack Exchange question here: the title is \"Infinite Series ∑_{n=1}^∞ (H_{2n+1})/n^2\" and the question is asking how to prove that this sum equals 11/4 ζ(3) + ζ(2) + 4 log(2) - 4. \n\nFirst, I need to filter out unrelated information. The user mentioned that the original post might have some extraneous details. The example given had assumptions like n being an integer and divisible by 7. But in this problem, the series starts at n=1 and goes to infinity, and involves harmonic numbers H_{2n+1}. \n\nSo, what are the assumptions here? The problem is about an infinite series. The harmonic numbers H_{2n+1} are defined as the sum from k=1 to 2n+1 of 1/k. The series is sum from n=1 to infinity of H_{2n+1}/n^2. The question is to prove the given closed-form expression.\n\nAssumptions would likely be the convergence of the series, but maybe that's implicit. Since H_{2n+1} is the (2n+1)-th harmonic number, that's a definition. The problem is to prove the equality, so the main assumption is the definition of H_{2n+1} and the structure of the series. But the example given didn't include convergence as an assumption, maybe because it's part of the problem. Wait, in the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7, but the original problem was for every integer n. So maybe in the example, the user added an assumption that wasn't there? Wait, no. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the original problem example: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem had assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem was for every integer n. That seems conflicting. Wait, maybe there was a mistake in the example? Because if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", then the assumption that n is divisible by 7 would be incorrect. Hmm, perhaps that's a typo or error in the example. Maybe the original problem had a different condition? Let me recheck.\n\nThe example says: Original problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91. Formatted problem assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Unless the original problem had a different condition but was misrepresented. Maybe the example is wrong. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instruction.\n\nIn the current problem, the series is from n=1 to infinity, involving H_{2n+1}/n^2. The problem is to prove the equality. So the assumptions here would be the definitions involved. Let me list them:\n\n1. H_{2n+1} is the (2n+1)-th harmonic number, defined as H_{2n+1} = ∑_{k=1}^{2n+1} 1/k.\n\n2. The series ∑_{n=1}^∞ H_{2n+1}/n^2 converges.\n\nBut wait, maybe convergence is part of what needs to be proven, not an assumption. The problem is to prove the sum equals that expression, so convergence might be implicitly required, but the user might not want to list that as an assumption. Alternatively, maybe there are no specific assumptions beyond the definitions. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which was converted into an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But that seems like an error unless the original problem was different. Maybe the user intended to modify the problem? That's unclear, but according to the user's instruction, we should filter unrelated information and structure the problem into assumptions and problem.\n\nSo for the current problem, the key elements are:\n\n- The sum is over n starting from 1 to infinity.\n\n- H_{2n+1} is the harmonic number.\n\n- The problem is to prove the sum equals the given expression.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- For each integer n ≥ 1, H_{2n+1} is defined as the sum from k=1 to 2n+1 of 1/k.\n\n- The series ∑_{n=1}^∞ H_{2n+1}/n^2 converges.\n\nBut maybe the convergence is part of the problem. Since the problem is to evaluate the sum, perhaps the convergence is implicitly assumed, but maybe it's part of the proof. However, in the example, the assumption included divisibility by 7 even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n\". So perhaps in the example, the user made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the example was a misrepresentation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original problem in the example had an additional condition that n is divisible by 7, but it was omitted in the original problem statement. But that's confusing.\n\nIn any case, for the current problem, the main thing is to extract assumptions. Since the problem is about an infinite series, perhaps the key assumption is that the series converges, but if we are to prove the value, maybe convergence is part of the problem. Alternatively, the problem might assume convergence and asks to find the sum. But in the problem statement, the user is asking to prove that the sum equals the given expression. So perhaps the convergence is part of the proof, not an assumption. Hence, maybe the only assumption is the definition of the harmonic numbers. So:\n\nAssumption: H_{2n+1} is the (2n+1)-th harmonic number, defined as H_{2n+1} = ∑_{k=1}^{2n+1} 1/k.\n\nProblem: Prove that ∑_{n=1}^∞ (H_{2n+1})/n^2 = (11/4)ζ(3) + ζ(2) + 4 log(2) - 4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants more granular assumptions. For example, each assumption is one line, one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\n\nH_{2n+1} is a harmonic number for each integer n ≥ 1,\n\nThe series ∑_{n=1}^∞ H_{2n+1}/n^2 is convergent.\n\nBut again, if the problem is to prove the sum equals that value, convergence is required but might not be an assumption. Maybe the problem assumes convergence. It's a bit ambiguous, but in the example, the assumptions were about the variable n. So perhaps here, the main assumption is the definition of H_{2n+1} as harmonic numbers. Therefore, structured as:\n\nAssumption:\n\nFor each integer n ≥ 1, H_{2n+1} = ∑_{k=1}^{2n+1} 1/k.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that ∑_{n=1}^∞ (H_{2n+1})/n^2 = 11/4 ζ(3) + ζ(2) + 4 log(2) - 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no specific assumptions beyond the standard definitions, so the problem is just to prove the equality. However, following the example, which listed assumptions even if they were part of the problem statement, perhaps here we need to list that the harmonic numbers are defined as such, and the series is over n starting from 1 to infinity.\n\nBut the example's original problem had \"for every integer n\", which was converted into an assumption that n is an integer. So in this case, the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is an integer greater than or equal to 1.\n\n- H_{2n+1} is the (2n+1)-th harmonic number.\n\nBut since the problem is an infinite series, n being an integer starting from 1 is part of the summation index, which is standard. However, in the example, they listed \"n is an integer\" even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n\". So perhaps in the formatted problem, we list \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. But in this problem, n is the summation index, which by definition runs over positive integers. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n\nn is a positive integer,\n\nH_{2n+1} is the (2n+1)-th harmonic number.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that ∑_{n=1}^∞ (H_{2n+1})/n^2 equals 11/4 ζ(3) + ζ(2) + 4 log(2) - 4.\n\nBut perhaps \"n is a positive integer\" is redundant because the sum is from n=1 to infinity. But the example included \"n is an integer\" even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So following that pattern, maybe list \"n is a positive integer\" as an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is about the sum, so the main assumption is the definition of H_{2n+1}. The other is that the sum is over n starting at 1. But that's part of the problem statement.\n\nIn the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", which was translated into an assumption. So here, since the sum is over n starting from 1, maybe \"n is a positive integer\" is an assumption.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n\nn is a positive integer,\n\nH_{2n+1} is defined as ∑_{k=1}^{2n+1} 1/k.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that ∑_{n=1}^∞ (H_{2n+1})/n^2 = (11/4)ζ(3) + ζ(2) + 4 log(2) - 4.\n\nThat seems to fit the format. Each assumption is a single property applied to one object (n and H_{2n+1}).",
