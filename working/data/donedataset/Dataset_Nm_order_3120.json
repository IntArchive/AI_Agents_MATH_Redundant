    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me start by reading the original question carefully. The user is asking about two parts: first, a reference for the proof of a particular lemma (J.-L. Lions' Lemma), and second, how to prove a specific inequality as a consequence.\n\nFirst, I'll handle part I. The problem mentions three Banach spaces X, Y, Z with their respective norms. The assumptions are that X is embedded compactly into Y and Y is embedded continuously into Z. The conclusion is an inequality involving the norms of these spaces with constants epsilon and C_epsilon. The user wants to know where to find a proof of this result. But according to the example provided, the problem part should be the actual mathematical statement to prove. However, since part I is asking for a reference, maybe it's better to structure the problem part as the statement to prove, and the assumption part lists the conditions given. The example included assumptions on n being an integer and divisible by 7, even though in the original problem, only \"for every integer n\" was stated, but the formatted problem added an extra assumption. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem's assumption says n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect. Wait, the original problem in the example says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption includes that n is divisible by 7. That's a mistake. Wait, 91 is 13*7, so perhaps the problem is to show divisibility by 91 for all integers n, but the user in the example made a mistake? Or perhaps the original problem had a different condition. Hmm. But perhaps in the example, the user made an error. Anyway, maybe the example is just illustrative. So, back to the current problem.\n\nThe user's problem has two parts. Part I is a request for a reference, but according to the instructions, the task is to structure the problem into assumptions and problem. So, for part I, the problem is to prove the inequality given the assumptions. Then part II is another problem to prove a different inequality as a consequence. So, the user is asking two questions, each with their own problem. But the format example shows that the problem is presented as a single problem. However, perhaps we need to structure each part as separate problems. But the user instructions say \"structure that problem as the following format\". The original problem has two parts: I and II. So perhaps each part is a separate problem. Let me check the example. In the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted problem listed assumptions and the problem. Here, the current problem has two parts, so perhaps we need to structure each part as separate entries. But the user's example didn't include multiple parts, so maybe the answer should combine them. Alternatively, since the user is asking for both parts, perhaps the problem section includes both. However, the example includes only one problem. The user's instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\", so perhaps each part is a separate problem. Let me try.\n\nFor part I:\n\nAssumptions:\nX, Y, Z are Banach spaces with norms ||.||_X, ||.||_Y, ||.||_Z,\nX is a subset of Y with compact injection,\nY is a subset of Z with continuous injection.\n\nProblem:\nProve that for every ε > 0, there exists C_ε ≥ 0 such that ||u||_Y ≤ ε ||u||_X + C_ε ||u||_Z for all u ∈ X.\n\nFor part II:\n\nAssumptions:\nu ∈ C^1([0,1]),\nProblem:\nProve that max_{[0,1]} |u| ≤ ε max_{[0,1]} |u’| + C_ε ||u||_{L^1([0,1])} for all u ∈ C^1([0,1]).\n\nBut wait, the second part is stated as a consequence, so maybe it's under the same assumptions but with specific spaces. The original part II is in the context of functions in C^1([0,1]), so the spaces here would be X = C^1 with norm max |u’|, Y = C^0 with max |u|, Z = L^1. The embeddings would be C^1 compactly embedded into C^0 (by Arzela-Ascoli), and C^0 continuously embedded into L^1. So the assumptions for part II would be different. But the user presents it as a consequence of the first result, so the problem is to apply the lemma from part I to prove this specific inequality. Therefore, the assumptions for part II would involve the specific spaces and embeddings.\n\nBut according to the problem statement in part II, the user writes \"how to prove\" the inequality. So to structure this, the assumptions would be that we are working with functions in C^1([0,1]), and the problem is to prove that inequality. However, in the first part, the assumptions are the general Banach spaces with certain embeddings. So perhaps each part is a separate problem.\n\nBut the user wants both parts structured. So perhaps present both, each with their own assumptions and problem. Let me check the example again. The example had the original problem as \"Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91\", and the formatted problem had assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\" which seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Alternatively, maybe the example is correct. Let me think: the original problem is that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The example formatted problem includes assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, which would imply that the problem is to prove divisibility by 91 under the assumption that n is divisible by 7. But that's not what the original problem says. So perhaps there's an error in the example. But the user provided it as their example. Therefore, maybe the user wants even if the original problem states \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem should include assumptions that are in the problem. Wait, but the original problem may have hidden assumptions. For instance, if 91 divides A(n) for every integer n, but maybe in the example, the user incorrectly added the assumption that n is divisible by 7. So maybe the example is not accurate, but the user provided it as their own formatting. So perhaps the task is to follow the user's example's approach, which in the example extracted the assumptions even if they are not explicitly stated. Wait, but in the original problem, \"for every integer n\", the assumption is that n is an integer, so in the formatted problem, that's listed. But in the example, they added \"n is divisible by 7\", but that wasn't in the original problem. That suggests that the example may have a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a typo. But regardless, the user's example shows that assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. So for the current problem, we need to list all the assumptions given in the problem, each as a separate line.\n\nIn the current problem, the user presents part I with three Banach spaces, X, Y, Z, with norms, X subset Y with compact injection, Y subset Z with continuous injection. Then the conclusion is the inequality. So for part I, the assumptions are:\n\n- X, Y, Z are Banach spaces with norms ||.||_X, ||.||_Y, ||.||_Z.\n- X is embedded in Y with compact injection.\n- Y is embedded in Z with continuous injection.\n\nProblem: Prove that for every ε > 0, there exists C_ε ≥ 0 such that ||u||_Y ≤ ε ||u||_X + C_ε ||u||_Z for all u ∈ X.\n\nThen part II is as a consequence, how to prove the inequality involving max |u| ≤ ε max |u’| + C_ε ||u||_{L^1}. Here, the spaces involved are:\n\n- X is C^1([0,1]) with norm max |u’| (since the left side has max |u| and the term with epsilon is max |u’|).\nWait, but actually, in the inequality given in part II, the problem is to show max |u| ≤ ε max |u’| + C_ε ||u||_{L^1}. Here, the norm for X would be the C^1 norm, but the term with epsilon is max |u’|, which is part of the C^1 norm, and the other term is L^1 norm. So perhaps the setup is:\n\n- X is C^1([0,1]) with norm ||u||_X = max |u’|,\n- Y is C^0([0,1]) with norm ||u||_Y = max |u|,\n- Z is L^1([0,1]) with norm ||u||_Z = ||u||_{L^1}.\n\nThen the embeddings would be X (C^1) compactly embedded into Y (C^0) by Arzela-Ascoli, and Y continuously embedded into Z (since continuous functions are integrable, and max |u| ≥ ||u||_{L^1} because integrating |u| over [0,1] is ≤ max |u| * 1. So the embedding Y into Z is continuous. Therefore, applying the lemma from part I, we get the inequality.\n\nTherefore, for part II, the assumptions would be:\n\n- u ∈ C^1([0,1]),\n- C^1([0,1]) is compactly embedded into C^0([0,1]),\n- C^0([0,1]) is continuously embedded into L^1([0,1]).\n\nProblem: Prove that max_{[0,1]} |u| ≤ ε max_{[0,1]} |u’| + C_ε ||u||_{L^1([0,1])} for all u ∈ C^1([0,1]).\n\nBut the user's part II says \"As a consequence of that how to prove...\", so it's applying the general result from part I to this specific case. Therefore, the problem is to show the specific inequality using the lemma from part I.\n\nSo, structuring part I and part II as separate problems, each with their own assumptions and problem statements. However, the user's original question includes both parts. Therefore, perhaps the formatted problem includes both parts as separate problems.\n\nBut the example given by the user only formats one problem. However, the user's instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\". The example included one problem. Therefore, maybe each part (I and II) should be formatted separately. Alternatively, the user might want both parts in one, but the example didn't do that. Alternatively, since the user's original post has two questions, perhaps we structure each as a separate problem.\n\nBut let's look at the user's instruction again: \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format\". The original question has two parts, but the user wants the problem structured as the given format, which in the example includes one assumption section and one problem. Therefore, perhaps for the entire problem, we need to list all assumptions from both parts, but that may not be possible because part II is a consequence. Alternatively, treat each part separately.\n\nAlternatively, the main problem is part I, and part II is a consequence, so perhaps the problem section includes both: \"Prove the inequality for Banach spaces and as a consequence, prove the specific inequality for C^1 functions\". But the example format has one problem. Maybe the user wants both parts to be structured as separate problems.\n\nBut the way the user presented the example, they took the original problem, which was one statement, and formatted it. The current problem has two questions. Therefore, perhaps the formatted problem should have two entries. However, the user's format example has one. Therefore, maybe the answer should combine them into one problem with both parts. However, the problem statements are separate.\n\nAlternatively, since part II is a consequence, perhaps it's a separate problem but under the same assumptions. But the assumptions for part II are different, as they involve specific spaces. Therefore, perhaps each part is a separate problem.\n\nGiven that, the assistant should structure both parts as separate problems. Therefore:\n\nFirst problem (part I):\n\nAssumption:\nX, Y, Z are Banach spaces with norms ||·||_X, ||·||_Y, ||·||_Z,\nX is embedded in Y with compact injection,\nY is embedded in Z with continuous injection.\n\nProblem:\nProve that for every ε > 0, there exists C_ε ≥ 0 such that ||u||_Y ≤ ε ||u||_X + C_ε ||u||_Z for all u ∈ X.\n\nSecond problem (part II):\n\nAssumption:\nu ∈ C^1([0,1]),\nC^1([0,1]) is compactly embedded into C^0([0,1]),\nC^0([0,1]) is continuously embedded into L^1([0,1]).\n\nProblem:\nProve that max_{[0,1]} |u| ≤ ε max_{[0,1]} |u’| + C_ε ||u||_{L^1([0,1])} for all u ∈ C^1([0,1}).\n\nBut in part II, the spaces are specific: X = C^1, Y = C^0, Z = L^1. So the assumptions should reflect that. Therefore, the assumptions for part II would be:\n\n- X = C^1([0,1]) with norm ||u||_X = max |u’|,\n- Y = C^0([0,1]) with norm ||u||_Y = max |u|,\n- Z = L^1([0,1]) with norm ||u||_Z = ||u||_{L^1},\n- X is compactly embedded into Y,\n- Y is continuously embedded into Z.\n\nBut maybe more precisely, the assumptions are:\n\n- C^1([0,1]) is a Banach space with norm max |u’|,\n- C^0([0,1]) is a Banach space with norm max |u|,\n- L^1([0,1]) is a Banach space with norm ||u||_{L^1},\n- The injection from C^1([0,1]) to C^0([0,1]) is compact,\n- The injection from C^0([0,1]) to L^1([0,1]) is continuous.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user just writes \"how to prove\" the inequality, which is a specific case of the general lemma. Therefore, the assumptions for part II are the specific embeddings. So perhaps the assumptions for part II are:\n\n- u is in C^1([0,1]),\n- The embedding C^1([0,1]) into C^0([0,1]) is compact,\n- The embedding C^0([0,1]) into L^1([0,1}) is continuous.\n\nProblem: Prove that max |u| ≤ ε max |u’| + C_ε ||u||_{L^1} for all u ∈ C^1([0,1}).\n\nBut in the lemma from part I, the inequality is ||u||_Y ≤ ε ||u||_X + C_ε ||u||_Z. So in this case, X is C^1 with norm ||u||_X = max |u’|, Y is C^0 with norm max |u|, Z is L^1. Then applying the lemma gives the desired inequality. Therefore, the assumptions for part II are the specific spaces and embeddings, and the problem is to prove the inequality.\n\nSo combining everything, the formatted problems would be:\n\nFor part I:\n\nAssumption:\nX, Y, Z are Banach spaces with norms ||·||_X, ||·||_Y, ||·||_Z,\nX is a subset of Y with compact injection,\nY is a subset of Z with continuous injection.\n\nProblem:\nProve that for every ε > 0, there exists C_ε ≥ 0 such that ||u||_Y ≤ ε ||u||_X + C_ε ||u||_Z for all u ∈ X.\n\nFor part II:\n\nAssumption:\nC^1([0,1]) is compactly embedded into C^0([0,1]),\nC^0([0,1]) is continuously embedded into L^1([0,1]),\nu ∈ C^1([0,1]).\n\nProblem:\nProve that max_{[0,1]} |u| ≤ ε max_{[0,1]} |u’| + C_ε ||u||_{L^1([0,1])} for all u ∈ C^1([0,1}).\n\nBut the user might want both parts structured as one, but the example shows each problem separately. However, the user's original post has two parts. Therefore, perhaps the answer should format each part as separate problems under the same question. But the user's example shows a single problem. Maybe the user expects both parts to be included under the same problem, but with both problems listed. However, the format example has one problem. Alternatively, the answer should present both parts as two separate formatted blocks.\n\nBut given the user's example, I think they expect each problem to be formatted separately. Therefore, the answer should have two formatted sections, one for part I and one for part II.\n\nBut since the user's original question combines them, perhaps the answer should present them as two separate problems under the same original question. However, the format requires \"Assumption\" and \"Problem\" sections. Therefore, perhaps each part is a separate problem with its own assumptions and problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be structured as:\n\nFor part I:\n\nAssumption:\nX, Y, Z are Banach spaces with norms $\\|\\cdot\\|_X$, $\\|\\cdot\\|_Y$, $\\|\\cdot\\|_Z$,\n$X$ is embedded in $Y$ with compact injection,\n$Y$ is embedded in $Z$ with continuous injection.\n\nProblem:\nProve that for every $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists $C_{\\epsilon} \\geq 0$ such that\n$$\\|u\\|_Y \\leq \\epsilon \\|u\\|_X + C_{\\epsilon}\\|u\\|_Z \\quad \\forall u \\in X.$$\n\nFor part II:\n\nAssumption:\n$u \\in C^1([0,1])$,\n$C^1([0,1])$ is compactly embedded into $C^0([0,1])$,\n$C^0([0,1])$ is continuously embedded into $L^1([0,1])$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that\n$$\\max_{[0,1]}|u| \\leq \\epsilon \\max_{[0,1]}|u'| + C_{\\epsilon}\\|u\\|_{L^1([0,1])} \\quad \\forall u \\in C^1([0,1]).$$\n\nBut wait, in the part II assumptions, the compact and continuous embeddings are properties of the function spaces, not of the individual function u. Therefore, the assumptions should be about the spaces and embeddings, not about u. So perhaps:\n\nFor part II:\n\nAssumption:\n$C^1([0,1])$ is a Banach space with norm $\\max_{[0,1]}|u'|$,\n$C^0([0,1])$ is a Banach space with norm $\\max_{[0,1]}|u|$,\n$L^1([0,1])$ is a Banach space with norm $\\|u\\|_{L^1}$,\nThe injection $C^1([0,1]) \\hookrightarrow C^0([0,1])$ is compact,\nThe injection $C^0([0,1]) \\hookrightarrow L^1([0,1])$ is continuous.\n\nProblem:\nProve that\n$$\\max_{[0,1]}|u| \\leq \\epsilon \\max_{[0,1]}|u'| + C_{\\epsilon}\\|u\\|_{L^1([0,1])} \\quad \\forall u \\in C^1([0,1]).$$\n\nBut perhaps more concisely, since the spaces are standard, we can omit their definitions and focus on the embeddings. So:\n\nAssumption:\n$C^1([0,1])$ is compactly embedded into $C^0([0,1])$,\n$C^0([0,1])$ is continuously embedded into $L^1([0,1])$,\n$u \\in C^1([0,1])$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that\n$$\\max_{[0,1]}|u| \\leq \\epsilon \\max_{[0,1]}|u'| + C_{\\epsilon}\\|u\\|_{L^1([0,1])} \\quad \\forall u \\in C^1([0,1]).$$\n\nBut the assumption \"u ∈ C^1([0,1])\" is part of the problem's universal quantification, so maybe it's redundant to state it as an assumption. The problem says \"for all u ∈ C^1\", so the assumption is inherent. Therefore, the assumptions should be the embeddings:\n\nAssumption:\nThe injection $C^1([0,1]) \\hookrightarrow C^0([0,1])$ is compact,\nThe injection $C^0([0,1]) \\hookrightarrow L^1([0,1])$ is continuous.\n\nProblem:\nProve that for every $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists $C_{\\epsilon} \\geq 0$ such that\n$$\\max_{[0,1]}|u| \\leq \\epsilon \\max_{[0,1]}|u'| + C_{\\epsilon}\\|u\\|_{L^1([0,1])} \\quad \\forall u \\in C^1([0,1]).$$\n\nYes, this seems correct. Because the problem is to prove the inequality for all u in C^1, given the embeddings. The user's part II is to apply the lemma from part I to this specific case, hence the assumptions here are the specific embeddings required to apply the lemma.\n\nTherefore, final formatted answer would be two separate formatted blocks, one for each part.",
