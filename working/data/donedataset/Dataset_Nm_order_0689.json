    "Content": "Lately I've been fooling around with points inside a triangle and the sum of their distances from all sides. This was when I noticed a weird behaviour: For each point I chose there always seemed to be a straight line going through my chosen point and the entire triangle where every point had the same sum of distances from all sides! And as if that's not enough, if I select a different point the line through this point looks parallel to all the other lines created in the same manner but through other points. So is there a way to prove my observation? Question: Do all points inside a triangle that have the same sum of distances from all sides lie on a line and is there a way to give a mathematical equation for said line? (Disregarding equilateral triangles) Because I used numerical means to find this pattern I am not sure whether it even exists. Any kind of help will be appreciated!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let us look at the problem in a slightly different angle. If one know baricentric coordinate system , it will be \"obvious\" why this is true. Let $\\vec{A}, \\vec{B}, \\vec{C}$ be any three non-collinear points,\nthey form the vertices of a non-degenerate triangle $\\triangle ABC$. \nFor any point $\\vec{p} \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, there exists a unique\npair of real numbers $\\alpha, \\beta$ such that $$\\vec{p}-\\vec{C} = \\alpha( \\vec{A}-\\vec{C}) + \\beta( \\vec{B} - \\vec{C} )\n\\quad\\iff\\quad \\vec{p} = \\alpha \\vec{A} + \\beta \\vec{B} + (1 - \\alpha - \\beta)\\vec{C}\n$$\nLet $\\gamma = 1 - \\alpha - \\beta$, the triplet $(\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma)$ is called the baricentric coordinates for $\\vec{p}$. \nFurthermore, the points $\\vec{p}$ lies inside or on $\\triangle ABC$ if and only if $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma \\ge 0$ Let $h_A, h_B, h_C$ be the height of $\\triangle ABC$ for corresponding vertices.\nThe distance between $\\vec{p}$ and the sides $BC$, $CA$, $AB$ are\n$h_A |\\alpha|$, $h_B |\\beta|$ and $h_C|\\gamma|$ respectively.\nThe loucs for a point whose sum of distances to the 3 sides equal to $d$ is then given by: $$h_A |\\alpha| + h_B|\\beta| + h_C|\\gamma| = d$$ For points inside $\\triangle ABC$, the problem of finding the locus is\nequivalent to solving following pair of linear equations: $$\\begin{array}{rrrl}\n\\alpha +& \\beta +& \\gamma &= 1\\\\\nh_A \\alpha +& h_B \\beta +& h_C \\gamma &= d\n\\end{array}\n$$\nWhen $\\triangle ABC$ is not equilateral, this pair of equations has rank 2 which\nhas either zero or infinite many solutions. Furthermore if $(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma)$ is a solution, other solution will have the form: $$(\\alpha',\\beta',\\gamma') = (\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma) + \\lambda (h_B-h_C,h_C-h_A,h_A-h_B)\\quad\\text{ for some } \\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}$$ Translate this back to points on $\\mathbb{R}^2$. This mean is $\\vec{p}$ is a point\ninside $\\triangle ABC$, the locus of point $\\vec{p}'$ have same sum of distances has the form: $$\\vec{p}' = \\vec{p} + \\lambda\\vec{u}, \\quad\\text{ for some }\\;\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}$$\ni.e. the locus is a line along the direction \n$\\displaystyle\\;\\vec{u} = (h_B-h_C)\\vec{A} + (h_C-h_A)\\vec{B} + (h_A-h_B)\\vec{C}$. Please note that this $\\vec{u}$ is independent of choice of $d$ and hence $\\vec{p}$.\nWhat this means is for all points inside $\\triangle ABC$, not only the locus of same distances are all lines, all those lines are parallel to each other! Clarifications About the question why multiplying $\\alpha$ with height $h_A$ gives us the\ndistance to line $BC$. For any point $p$, let $d_p$ be the distance of $p$ \nto the line $BC$. By definition, we have\n$$\\vec{p} - \\vec{C} = \\alpha(\\vec{A}-\\vec{C}) + \\beta(\\vec{B}-\\vec{C}).$$\nFor any fixed $\\alpha$, let $\\vec{p}_0 = \\vec{C} + \\alpha(\\vec{A}-\\vec{C})$. For any point $p$ with same $\\alpha$, we have\n$$\\vec{p} - \\vec{p_0} = \\beta (\\vec{B} - \\vec{C})$$\nWhen viewed from $p_0$, $p$ is along the direction $\\vec{B}-\\vec{C}$. This means the locus of $p$ for fixed $\\alpha$ is a line parallel to the side $BC$. As a result, $d_p$ is constant over such a line and $d_p$ depends only on $\\alpha$.\nAs long as $p$ doesn't crosses the line $BC$, it is clear this dependence on $\\alpha$ is linear. Notice When $\\alpha = 0$, the line of constant $\\alpha$ coincides with line $BC$, so $d_p = 0$ there. When $\\alpha = 1$, the line of constant $\\alpha$ crosses $A$, so $d_p = h_A$ there. Combine these, we find the proportional constant is $h_A$ when $\\alpha \\ge 0$.\nThis means as long as $p$ is on the same side as $A$ with respect to line $BC$, $d_p = h_A \\alpha = h_A |\\alpha|$. By symmetry, $d_p = h_A |\\alpha|$ on the other side too.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem. The user is talking about points inside a triangle where each point has the same sum of distances from all sides. They noticed that these points lie on a straight line, and different lines for different sums seem parallel. The question is to prove that all such points lie on a line and find its equation, excluding equilateral triangles.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem mentions a triangle (not equilateral), points inside it, each point having the same sum of distances to all sides. The user wants to prove that these points form a line and find its equation.\n\nAssumptions should be one per line, each about one object or condition. So:\n\n- The triangle is not equilateral. (Disregarding equilateral triangles as per the question.)\n- The point is inside the triangle. (The user specifies \"inside\".)\n- The sum of the distances from the point to all three sides is constant. (This is the key condition.)\n\nThe problem is to prove that all such points lie on a straight line and to provide the equation of that line.\n\nWait, the original problem also mentions that lines through different points (with different sums?) are parallel. But the main question is about points with the same sum lying on a line. So maybe the assumption is that the sum is fixed, and the line consists of all points with that sum. Then, the lines for different sums are parallel. So the problem has two parts: existence of the line for a fixed sum, and parallelism of lines for different sums.\n\nBut the user's exact question is: \"Do all points inside a triangle that have the same sum of distances from all sides lie on a line and is there a way to give a mathematical equation for said line?\"\n\nSo the main problem is to prove that all points with the same sum lie on a line and find its equation. The parallelism might be a follow-up, but the question as phrased is focused on the existence of the line and its equation.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- Consider a triangle that is not equilateral.\n- Consider points inside the triangle.\n- The sum of the distances from each point to all three sides of the triangle is constant.\n\nProblem: Prove that all such points lie on a straight line and find the equation of this line.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is a single condition per line. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe triangle is not equilateral,\nThe point is located inside the triangle,\nThe sum of the distances from the point to each of the three sides of the triangle is a constant value.\n\nProblem: Prove that all points satisfying the above lie on a straight line and determine the mathematical equation of this line.\n\nThat seems to capture it. The original problem's example had assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So each assumption is a separate line. Here, \"the triangle is not equilateral\" is one assumption. \"The point is inside the triangle\" is another. \"Sum of distances is constant\" is the third.\n\nYes, that's structured correctly. The problem statement then asks to prove the line exists and find its equation.",
