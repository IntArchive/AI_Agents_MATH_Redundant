    "Content": "I am reading Hoffman and Kunze's Linear Algebra and in Section 3.5, page 101, they define the annihilator of a subset as follows: Definition. If $V$ is a vector space over the field $F$ and $S$ is a subset of $V$, the annihilator of $S$ is the set $S^0$ of linear functionals $f$ on $V$ such that $f(\\alpha) = 0$ for every $\\alpha$ in $S$. In the following paragraph, they say that If $S = V$, then $S^0$ is the zero subspace of $V^*$. (This is easy to see when $V$ is finite-dimensional.) My question is regarding the statement within the parentheses. Is there some subtlety when considering infinite-dimensional vector spaces? Below is my proof of the fact that $S^0 = \\{ 0 \\}$ when $S = V$. Let $S = V$. If $f \\in V^*$ is a non-zero functional, then $f(v) \\neq 0$ for some $v \\in V = S$. So, $f \\not\\in S^0$. So, $S^0 \\subseteq \\{ 0 \\}$. Also, if $0$ is the zero functional, then it maps every $v \\in V = S$ to $0$, and so $\\{ 0 \\} \\subseteq S^0$. Hence, $S^0$ is the zero subspace of $V^*$. I don't see where the dimension of $V$ plays a role in the above proof. Is the statement given within the parantheses redundant, or am I missing something crucial in understanding the case $\\dim V = \\infty$?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Your argument is correct since we have that\n$$\n        f \\in V^0\n  \\iff  \\forall v \\in V: f(v) = 0\n  \\iff  f = 0.\n$$\n(This is just a compressed version of your argumentation.) What also holds is a related statement, namely that the set\n$$\n  U := \\{v \\in V \\mid \\forall f \\in V^*: f(v) = 0\\}\n$$\nis just the zero vector space:\nWe can extend every $v \\in V$, $v \\neq 0$ to a basis $\\mathcal{B}$ of $V$, and then define a (unique) linear function $f \\colon V \\to F$ with $f(v) = 1$ and $f(v') = 0$ for all $v' \\in \\mathcal{B}$, $v' \\neq v$ (the values $f(v')$ do not matter).\nThen $f(v) = 1 \\neq 0$, so $v \\notin U$. Because this construction uses a basis $\\mathcal{B}$ of $V$, one can argue that there is a difference between the finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional case for this related statement.\n(I don’t know if Hoffman & Kunze prove the existence of bases for infinite dimensional vector spaces.)\nMy best guess is that Hoffman & Kunze mixed this up when writing the quoted text.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. The user is asking about the annihilator of the entire vector space V, which is supposed to be the zero subspace of the dual space V*. Hoffman and Kunze mention that this is easy to see when V is finite-dimensional, but the question is whether there's a subtlety in infinite-dimensional cases. The user provided a proof that seems not to depend on dimension and is confused why the book mentions finite-dimensionality.\n\nFirst, let's recall definitions. The annihilator S⁰ of a subset S of V is the set of all linear functionals in V* that send every element of S to zero. When S is V itself, S⁰ should be just the zero functional because if a functional is non-zero, there must be some vector it doesn't annihilate. But wait, in infinite dimensions, do we have functionals that are zero on all vectors? The zero functional is the only one, right?\n\nThe user's proof seems correct: if f is non-zero, there exists some v in V where f(v) ≠ 0, hence f isn't in S⁰. Conversely, the zero functional is in S⁰. Therefore, S⁰ is {0}. But the book says this is easy to see in finite dimensions. Why specify that? Maybe in infinite dimensions, there's a different interpretation? Wait, but the dual space in infinite dimensions is more complicated. However, the definition of a linear functional is the same: a linear map from V to the field. Even in infinite dimensions, if a functional is non-zero, it must act non-trivially on some vector. So why does the book mention finite-dimensionality here?\n\nPerhaps in the infinite-dimensional case, the proof requires the axiom of choice? Because to assert that every vector space has a basis, you need the axiom of choice. But in the user's proof, they didn't use a basis. They just used the existence of a vector where f is non-zero, which comes directly from the definition of a non-zero functional. A functional is non-zero iff there exists at least one vector it maps to a non-zero scalar. So maybe the book's comment is redundant, and the statement holds regardless of dimension. \n\nWait, maybe in some contexts without the axiom of choice? If you don't have AC, maybe you can't guarantee that every non-zero functional has a vector where it's non-zero? But that seems far-fetched. The definition of a functional being non-zero is that it's not the zero function, so by definition, there must be some input where the output isn't zero. That doesn't require AC, right? It's just the definition of equality of functions. So even in the absence of AC, if a functional is non-zero, by definition, there's a vector where it's non-zero. Therefore, the user's proof should hold in any dimension, regardless of the vector space's size or basis.\n\nSo the mention of finite-dimensionality in the book might be a red herring, or perhaps the authors were being extra cautious, but the actual proof doesn't rely on dimension. The user's confusion is valid because their proof didn't use any finite-dimensional properties, so the parentheses in the book might be unnecessary. Therefore, the answer is that the statement holds in general, and the finite-dimensional comment isn't necessary. The user's proof is correct in any dimension.",
