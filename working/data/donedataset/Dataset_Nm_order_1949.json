    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows how assumptions and the problem should be listed. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original problem carefully. The question is about a conjectured general continued fraction involving gamma functions. The user provided a lot of information, including specific cases and corollaries, but I need to filter out the unnecessary parts.\n\nThe main problem here is to determine whether the conjectured continued fraction is true for all complex numbers a and b with certain conditions. The original problem mentions complex numbers a and b, specifically a = x + iy and b = m + in, with x > 0 and m > 0. The conjecture is that the ratio of two gamma functions equals a certain continued fraction. There's also a further generalization provided, but the core question is about the validity of equation (1).\n\nSo, the assumptions would include the definitions of a and b as complex numbers with positive real parts (since x > 0 and m > 0). Also, the gamma function's conditions: gamma function is defined for complex numbers except non-positive integers, but here the arguments of the gamma functions need to be such that they don't hit poles. However, since the user specified x > 0 and m > 0, maybe those conditions ensure that the arguments of the gamma functions are valid. Let me check the arguments:\n\nFor the numerator: (a + 3b)/(4(a + b)) and (3a + b)/(4(a + b)). Let's substitute a = x + iy, b = m + in. The real parts would be (x + 3m)/(4(x + m)) and (3x + m)/(4(x + m)). Since x > 0 and m > 0, the denominators are positive. The numerators are x + 3m and 3x + m, both positive as x and m are positive. So the real parts of the arguments in the gamma functions in the numerator are positive. Similarly for the denominator gamma functions: (3a + 5b)/(4(a + b)) and (5a + 3b)/(4(a + b)). The real parts here would be (3x + 5m)/(4(x + m)) and (5x + 3m)/(4(x + m)). Again, x and m positive, so these are positive. Thus, the gamma functions are defined.\n\nTherefore, the key assumptions are that a and b are complex numbers with positive real parts (x > 0, m > 0). The problem is to verify if the continued fraction equation holds under these assumptions.\n\nThe original question mentions \"for all complex numbers a, b with x>0 and m>0\". So in the assumptions, we need to list that a and b are complex numbers, the real part of a is positive, and the real part of b is positive. Each assumption should be on its own line, addressing one property per line.\n\nI also need to make sure not to include the corollaries or special cases in the assumptions, as they are examples, not the general problem's conditions. The problem is specifically about the general case, not the specializations.\n\nSo, the formatted problem should have assumptions:\n\n- $a$ is a complex number with real part $x > 0$,\n- $b$ is a complex number with real part $m > 0$,\n- $\\Gamma(z)$ denotes the gamma function.\n\nAnd the problem is to prove that the given continued fraction (equation 1) holds under these conditions.\n\nI need to check if there are more assumptions. The original problem states that the continued fraction is symmetric in a and b. But that's part of the conjecture, not an assumption. The problem is whether that equation holds true given the conditions on a and b. So the assumptions are just the conditions on a, b, and gamma function.\n\nWait, the gamma function's functional equation might be relevant, but the user hasn't stated any specific conditions on gamma beyond its standard definition. The problem assumes gamma is defined, which is already covered by the real parts of the arguments being positive. So I think those three assumptions are sufficient.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption: \n$a$ is a complex number with real part $x > 0$,\n$b$ is a complex number with real part $m > 0$,\n$\\Gamma(z)$ is the gamma function.\n\nProblem: \nProve that \n$$\\frac{\\displaystyle\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{a+3b}{4(a+b)}\\right)\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{3a+b}{4(a+b)}\\right)}{\\displaystyle\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{3a+5b}{4(a+b)}\\right)\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{5a+3b}{4(a+b)}\\right)}=\\cfrac{4(a+b)}{a+b+\\cfrac{(2a)(2b)} {3(a+b)+\\cfrac{(3a+b)(a+3b)}{5(a+b)+\\cfrac{(4a+2b)(2a+4b)}{7(a+b)+\\ddots}}}}$$\nholds for all complex numbers $a$, $b$ with $x>0$ and $m>0$.",
