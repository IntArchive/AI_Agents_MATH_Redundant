    "Content": "If $f \\colon [a,b] \\rightarrow [c,d]$ is a bijection, $f\\in \\mathcal{R}$ and $f^{-1}$ exists, then prove or disprove that $f^{-1} \\in \\mathcal{R} [c,d]$. Remark: I tried to use integration by parts to find $\\int_{c}^{d} f^{-1}$ and to prove that was the right limit of Riemann sum, but failed. But I think this idea might be useful.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $C\\subset[0,1]$ be the middle thirds Cantor set , and let $D\\subset[0,1]$ be a fat Cantor set .  Define $f:[0,1]\\to[0,1]$ such that $f\\vert_C$ is an order preserving homeomorphism of $C$ onto $D$ (by mapping to corresponding endpoints of the removed intervals), and $f\\vert_{[0,1]\\setminus C}$ is an order reversing homeomorphism of $[0,1]\\setminus C$ onto $[0,1]\\setminus D$ (by mapping linearly to corresponding removed intervals and then composing with $x\\mapsto 1-x$).  Then $f$ is discontinuous at each point of $C$ and continuous at each point of $[0,1]\\setminus C$.  Since $C$ has measure zero, $f$ is Riemann integrable . On the other hand, $f^{-1}$ is discontinuous at each point of $D$, so it is not Riemann integrable. If you don't want to appeal to the Lebesgue criterion of Riemann integrability, you could work explicitly with Riemann sums of $f$ and $f^{-1}$.  In the case of $f$, you can choose partitions such that the contribution of intervals containing points of $C$ is arbitrarily small.  In the case of $f^{-1}$, the values of $f^{-1}$ on $D\\cap[\\frac{1}{2},1]$ are at least $\\frac{2}{3}$ and the values of $f^{-1}$ on $[\\frac{1}{2},1]\\setminus D$ are at most $\\frac{1}{2}$.  Every interval contains points from $[0,1]\\setminus D$, so the difference between upper and lower sums will always be at least $(\\frac{2}{3}-\\frac{1}{2})(\\frac{1}{2}m(D))\\gt 0$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given question from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The example provided shows that I need to list each assumption line by line, addressing only one property or condition per line, applied to one object. Then, state the problem clearly.\n\nThe original question is about the Riemann integrability of the inverse function. The problem states: If f: [a,b] → [c,d] is a bijection, f is Riemann integrable, and f inverse exists, then prove or disprove if f inverse is Riemann integrable on [c,d].\n\nFirst, I need to parse the assumptions. The function f has several properties here. Let me break them down one by one. \n\n1. The domain of f is the interval [a,b], and the codomain is [c,d]. \n2. f is a bijection. That means it's both injective and surjective. Since it's a bijection, the inverse function f⁻¹ must exist. The problem mentions that f⁻¹ exists, so that's another condition, but actually, if it's a bijection, the inverse automatically exists. Maybe the user included that for emphasis, but I should list it as a separate assumption to be thorough.\n3. f is Riemann integrable on [a,b].\n\nNow, the problem is to prove or disprove whether f⁻¹ is Riemann integrable on [c,d].\n\nWait, the problem says \"prove or disprove\". So the answer isn't straightforward. The user is asking whether the inverse function is necessarily Riemann integrable given those conditions. \n\nLooking at the example, the original problem had assumptions listed line by line. So for this problem, each assumption should be a single line. Let's check:\n\n- f: [a,b] → [c,d] is a bijection. (This is one assumption: the function is a bijection between those intervals.)\n- f ∈ R (Riemann integrable on [a,b]).\n- f⁻¹ exists. (Though redundant if bijection is already stated, but maybe the problem mentions it explicitly, so include it as a separate assumption.)\n\nWait, but in the example given by the user, the original problem had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions, even though the first was already part of the problem statement. So maybe here, even if some conditions are implied by others, they should still be listed separately if they are explicitly mentioned in the problem. The original question says \"f is a bijection, f∈R and f⁻¹ exists\". So the user wrote all three: bijection, f is Riemann integrable, and inverse exists. Even though bijection implies inverse exists, the problem states it, so we need to list them as separate assumptions.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n1. f: [a,b] → [c,d] is a bijection.\n2. f is Riemann integrable on [a,b].\n3. f⁻¹ exists.\n\nThen the problem is to prove or disprove that f⁻¹ is Riemann integrable on [c,d].\n\nWait, but perhaps the codomain is [c,d], which is the domain of f⁻¹. So the problem is about the integrability of f⁻¹ on its domain [c,d]. \n\nSo putting it all together, the structured problem should have the assumptions listed as above, each on a separate line, and the problem statement as given.",
