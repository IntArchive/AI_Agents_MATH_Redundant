    "Content": "I want to prove what $x^{10} +x^3+1$ is irreducible over a field $\\mathbb F_{2}$ and $x^5$ + $x^4 +x^3 + x^2 +x -1$ is reducible over $\\mathbb F_{3}$. As far as I know Eisenstein criteria won't help here.\nI have heard about a criteria of irreducibility which sounds like \"If $f(x)$ divides $x^{p^n-1}-1$ (where $n=\\deg(f))$, $p$ is from $\\mathbb F_{p}$ then $f(x)$ is irreducible.\" But I don't know how to show if $f(x)$ can be divided by this or not.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The test that you're thinking of is Rabin's test for irreducibility , which can be stated as follows. Let $f(x)$ be a polynomial of degree $n$ over $\\mathbb{F}_p$. Then $f$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{F}_p$ if and only if $f(x)$ divides $x^{p^n}-x$, and $\\mathrm{gcd}\\bigl(f(x),x^{p^{n/q}}-x\\bigr)=1$ for each prime divisor $q$ of $n$. For $f(x) = x^{10}+x^3+1 \\in \\mathbb{F}_2[x]$, we must check that $f(x)$ divides $x^{2^{10}}-x = x^{1024}-x$, and that it is relatively prime with $x^{32}-x$ and $x^4-x$. For $f(x) = x^5 + x^4+x^3+x^2+x-1 \\in\\mathbb{F}_3[x]$, we must check that $f(x)$ divides $x^{243}-x$ and that it is relatively prime with $x^3-x$. All of this is easy to do on a computer.  In Mathematica , the PolynomialExtendedGCD command can check polynomial GCD's modulo any prime. In[1] := PolynomialExtendedGCD[x^10 + x^3 + 1, x^1024 - x, x, Modulus -> 2][[1]]\n\nOut[1] := 1 + x^3 + x^10\n\nIn[2] := PolynomialExtendedGCD[x^10 + x^3 + 1, x^32 - x, x, Modulus -> 2][[1]]\n\nOut[2] := 1\n\nIn[3] := PolynomialExtendedGCD[x^10 + x^3 + 1, x^4 - x, x, Modulus -> 2][[1]]\n\nOut[3] := 1 This establishes that $x^{10}+x^3+1$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{F}_2$.  For the other polynomial, we can try: In[1] := PolynomialExtendedGCD[x^5+x^4+x^3+x^2+x-1, x^243 - x, x, Modulus -> 3][[1]]\n\nOut[1] := 1 As you can see, the GCD is $1$, so it doesn't divide.  Indeed,\n$$\nx^5+x^4+x^3+x^2+x-1 \\;=\\; \\bigl(x^2-x-1\\bigr)\\bigl(x^3-x^2+x+1\\bigr)\n$$\nover $\\mathbb{F}_3$, so the second polynomial isn't irreducible. Edit: As Jyrki Lahtonen and Alex M. point out, one can always just use Mathematica directly to test whether a polynomial is irreducible, so there's not a practical reason to use Rabin's test in Mathematica for these two polynomials.  Also, if you have access to a computer, you can always in principle check whether a polynomial is irreducible simply by enumerating all possible factors and then attempting to divide by each factor.  If you don't have access to a computer, the methods suggested in their answers are certainly better than doing Rabin's method by hand. However, Rabin's test is important from an algorithmic point of view as one possible way to check for irreducibility.  Indeed, for polynomials of high degree, Rabin's test clearly outperforms trial division by all possible factors, though there are other competitive algorithms .   The two given problems are simple enough that almost any algorithm you use on a computer will give the desired results very quickly, but it is still instructive to see how Rabin's test can be applied to these examples.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that two polynomials are irreducible or reducible over specific finite fields. Let's break down each part.\n\nFirst, for the polynomial x¹⁰ + x³ + 1 over 𝔽₂. The user mentioned Eisenstein isn't helpful here, so they need another method. The criteria they recall involves checking if the polynomial divides x^(pⁿ -1) -1 where n is the degree. Wait, actually, the standard irreducibility test for finite fields is that a polynomial of degree n is irreducible over 𝔽_p if and only if it divides x^(pⁿ -1) -1 and doesn't divide x^(pᵏ -1) -1 for any k < n. So for x¹⁰ over 𝔽₂, n=10. So we need to check if it divides x^(2¹⁰ -1) -1 = x^1023 -1 and doesn't divide x^(2ᵏ -1) -1 for any k dividing 10 (like k=1,2,5). That might be cumbersome, but maybe there's another approach. Alternatively, maybe using the fact that if it's irreducible, then all its roots are in 𝔽_{2¹⁰}, and checking for roots in smaller extensions. But since it's degree 10, manual factoring is tough. Alternatively, check for roots in 𝔽₂, which it doesn't have (f(0)=1, f(1)=1+1+1=1≠0). Then check if it's divisible by any irreducible quadratics, cubics, etc. But that's time-consuming. The user might need to apply the Rabin's test or use the mentioned criterion.\n\nSecond polynomial: x⁵ + x⁴ +x³ +x² +x -1 over 𝔽₃. To show it's reducible. First, check for roots in 𝔽₃. Let's plug in x=0: -1 mod3=2≠0. x=1: 1+1+1+1+1-1=4≡1≠0. x=2: 32 +16 +8 +4 +2 -1=61≡1 mod3, which is 1≠0. So no linear factors. Then check if it factors into quadratic times cubic. Find if it has an irreducible quadratic factor. The irreducible quadratics over 𝔽₃ are x² +x -1, x² -x -1, x² +1, etc. Maybe try dividing the quintic by these quadratics to see if there's a factor. Alternatively, use Berlekamp's algorithm. But since the user wants to show reducibility, finding one factor suffices. Alternatively, check if the polynomial shares a common factor with x³³ -x (since over 𝔽₃, x³³ -x splits into all irreducible polynomials of degrees dividing 5, but maybe that's too broad. Alternatively, since 3^5 -1 =242, but I'm not sure. Maybe the user needs to apply the same irreducibility test but show that it doesn't meet the criteria, hence reducible. For the first polynomial, since it's degree 10, checking if it divides x^1023 -1 and not any lower would confirm irreducibility. For the second, if it factors, then it would divide x^3^k -1 for some k <5. But perhaps there's a better way. The user might need to structure the problem by clarifying the assumptions, like the field sizes, degrees, and the specific polynomials. The original problem mentions 𝔽₂ and 𝔽₃, so the assumptions should list the field for each polynomial and their degrees. The problem statements are to prove irreducibility for the first and reducibility for the second. The user also refers to a specific irreducibility criterion involving divisibility by x^{p^n -1} -1, which should be part of the problem structure.",
