    "Content": "This is the question: \"Show that the derivative of an even function is odd and that the derivative of an odd function is even.\n(Write the equation that says $f$ is even, and differentiate both sides, using the\nchain rule.)\" I already read numerous solutions online. The following block shows the official solution, but I didn't quite understand it. (Particularly, I'm not convinced why exactly $dz/dx=-1$ if $z=-x$ .) (1F-6). Following the hint, let $z=-x$ . If $f$ is even, then $f(x)=f(z).$ Differentiating and using the chain rule: $$f'(x)=f'(z) \\frac{dz}{dx}=-f'(z),$$ because $\\frac{dz}{dx}=-1.$ But this means that $f'$ is odd. Similarly, if $g$ is odd, then $g(x)=-g(z)$ . Differentiating and using the chain rule: $$g'(x)=-g'(z) \\frac{dz}{dx}=g'(z),$$ because $\\frac{dz}{dx}=-1.$ Thanks in advance =]",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Following the official solution, we have $f(-x) = -f(x)$ by assumption. Thus, by considering the function $g(x) = -x = (-1) \\cdot x$, we have $f(g(x)) = (-1)\\cdot f(x)$. Differentiating on both sides gives $$\\frac{d}{dx} f(g(x)) - \\frac{d}{dx} (-1)\\cdot f(x) = -1 \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx} f(x).$$ Now, applying the chain rule, we get $$\\frac{d}{dx} f(g(x)) = \\frac{df}{dx} g(x) \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx} g(x) = \\frac{df}{dx} (-x) \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx} (-1 \\cdot x) = \\frac{df}{dx} (-x) \\cdot (-1).$$ Equating both sides and simplifying gives $$\\frac{d}{dx} f(-x) = \\frac{d}{dx} f(x).$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this problem. The user is asking about proving that the derivative of an even function is odd and vice versa. The original question mentions using the chain rule by differentiating both sides after setting z = -x. The confusion here is about why dz/dx is -1. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall what even and odd functions are. An even function satisfies f(x) = f(-x) for all x, and an odd function satisfies f(x) = -f(-x). The problem wants to show that taking the derivative swaps these properties: the derivative of an even function is odd, and the derivative of an odd function is even.\n\nThe user is confused about the step where z = -x, leading to dz/dx = -1. Let's see. If z is defined as -x, then the derivative of z with respect to x is indeed -1 because dz/dx = d(-x)/dx = -1. That seems straightforward, but maybe the user is getting tripped up by substitution in the chain rule. Let me check the example given.\n\nIn the solution, for the even function case, they start with f(x) = f(z) where z = -x. Differentiating both sides, using the chain rule: f'(x) = f'(z) * dz/dx. Since dz/dx = -1, this becomes f'(x) = -f'(z). But z is -x, so f'(x) = -f'(-x), which is the definition of an odd function. Therefore, the derivative f' is odd.\n\nSimilarly, for the odd function g(x) = -g(z), differentiating gives g'(x) = -g'(z)*dz/dx. Plugging dz/dx = -1, we get g'(x) = -g'(z)*(-1) = g'(z), which means g'(x) = g'(-x), so the derivative is even.\n\nSo the key steps are defining z = -x, computing dz/dx, and then substituting back into the differentiated equation. The user's confusion might be about why the derivative of z with respect to x is -1. Perhaps they're mixing up variables or not seeing the direct differentiation. Let's make sure that when you have z = -x, dz/dx is simply the derivative of -x with respect to x, which is -1. There's no hidden step here; it's basic differentiation.\n\nNow, structuring the problem as per the required format. The assumptions need to be listed line by line, each addressing one property. The problem statement is to show the derivatives of even and odd functions are odd and even respectively.\n\nSo the assumptions would include that f is even (for the first part), then that f is differentiable (since we're taking its derivative). Similarly, for the second part, g is odd and differentiable. However, in the original problem, the user is to prove both directions, so maybe the assumptions need to cover both cases. Wait, but the example given in the original problem had assumptions specific to each part. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example provided by the user, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7, but the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. Here, the problem is to show two things: derivative of even is odd and derivative of odd is even. So perhaps the assumptions are split into two parts. Let me structure them accordingly.\n\nAssumptions:\nFor the first part (even function):\n- f is an even function.\n- f is differentiable.\n\nFor the second part (odd function):\n- g is an odd function.\n- g is differentiable.\n\nBut according to the format, each assumption should be a single line, addressing one property applied to one object. So maybe list them separately.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nf is an even function,\nf is differentiable,\ng is an odd function,\ng is differentiable.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to show both statements. The original problem says \"Show that the derivative of an even function is odd and that the derivative of an odd function is even.\" So the assumptions would need to cover both functions. Alternatively, perhaps each part (even and odd) has their own assumptions. But the example given by the user in the previous case had assumptions listed line by line, not separated into parts. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the assumptions were:\n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by 7.\n\nBut the problem had to do with A(n) being divisible by 91. So in that case, the assumptions were all about n. In this current problem, the functions f and g each have their own properties. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nf is an even function,\nf is differentiable,\ng is an odd function,\ng is differentiable.\n\nBut the problem is to show two separate things: derivative of even is odd, and derivative of odd is even. However, the problem statement is as given. The user's question is about the entire problem statement, so the assumptions should include that f is even and differentiable, and g is odd and differentiable. However, the problem statement is as written.\n\nAlternatively, maybe split into two separate problems, but the original problem combines them. The original question says \"Show that the derivative of an even function is odd and that the derivative of an odd function is even.\" So it's two parts in one problem. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nf is an even function,\nf is differentiable,\ng is an odd function,\ng is differentiable.\n\nBut each assumption is a single line. So each property for each function. Then the problem is to show both statements. Alternatively, maybe the problem is split, but according to the example, it's combined. The example had the problem as one statement. So perhaps structure it as:\n\nAssumption:\nf is an even function,\nf is differentiable,\nproblem: Prove that the derivative of f is odd.\n\nAssumption:\ng is an odd function,\ng is differentiable,\nproblem: Prove that the derivative of g is even.\n\nBut the original problem is to show both in one problem. So perhaps the user's example had the problem combined. Let me check the original problem's formatting. The user's example had:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n... Then formatted as:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut in this case, the original problem is two parts in one. So maybe the assumptions list all the necessary conditions, and the problem is the combined statement. However, the problem here is two separate claims. But in the original problem presented by the user (the derivative one), the problem is as written: \"Show that the derivative of an even function is odd and that the derivative of an odd function is even.\" So it's one problem with two parts. So the assumptions need to cover both parts.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- f is an even function (for the first part),\n- f is differentiable,\n- g is an odd function (for the second part),\n- g is differentiable.\n\nEach on its own line. Then the problem is the combined statement.\n\nBut perhaps in the formatted problem, it's better to list all the necessary assumptions for each part. Wait, but the example given by the user includes assumptions that were in the original problem but also added an extra one (n divisible by 7), which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that's strange. Wait, let me check:\n\nOriginal problem in the example: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems incorrect. The original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That changes the problem. Maybe that example was a mistake. Because the original problem says for every integer n, but the formatted problem restricts n to be divisible by 7, making the problem different. So perhaps the user's example is incorrect, but following their structure, perhaps they intended to extract assumptions from the problem, but in this case, the problem states \"for every integer n\", so the only assumption is that n is an integer. But the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", which is not in the original problem. So maybe the example was wrong. Therefore, maybe in this current problem, the assumptions should only be what is given in the problem. The problem says \"Show that the derivative of an even function is odd and that the derivative of an odd function is even.\" So the assumptions here are that f is even and differentiable, and g is odd and differentiable. So each of these should be listed as separate assumptions.\n\nTherefore:\n\nAssumption:\nf is an even function,\nf is differentiable,\ng is an odd function,\ng is differentiable.\n\nProblem: Show that the derivative of f is odd and the derivative of g is even.\n\nBut perhaps, since the problem is to show two separate things (even => derivative odd, odd => derivative even), maybe structure each with their own assumptions. But according to the user's example, even if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem's assumption includes n being an integer and divisible by 7, which seems like a mistake. Maybe the user intended to have the assumptions extracted from the problem, but in this case, the problem is general. However, the example given by the user might have been a misrepresentation. Alternatively, perhaps in the example, the original problem had n being any integer, but the formatted problem added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. But that would change the problem. So perhaps there was a miscommunication in the example. Therefore, in the current problem, I should extract the assumptions from the problem as stated. The problem states \"Show that the derivative of an even function is odd and that the derivative of an odd function is even.\" Therefore, the assumptions are that f is even and differentiable for the first part, and g is odd and differentiable for the second part. Therefore, in the formatted problem:\n\nAssumption:\nf is an even function,\nf is differentiable,\ng is an odd function,\ng is differentiable.\n\nProblem: Show that the derivative of f is odd and the derivative of g is even.\n\nBut perhaps each assumption should be for a single object. Since f and g are different functions, maybe list them separately. But the problem combines both into one statement. Alternatively, maybe the problem is two separate problems. But the user presents it as one problem. Therefore, to follow the example, even if the example was incorrect, I should proceed as per the user's instruction, which in their example added an assumption not present in the original problem. However, that might have been a mistake. In the current problem, the user's question is about derivative of even being odd and vice versa. The original problem says to prove both, so the assumptions are that f is even and differentiable, and g is odd and differentiable. Therefore, the formatted problem should list those four assumptions, each on their own line. Even though in the example, the assumption added a condition (n divisible by 7) which wasn't in the original problem, but maybe that was a different case. In this current problem, we shouldn't add extra assumptions, just list what is necessary. The necessary assumptions are:\n\nFor proving derivative of even function is odd:\n- f is even,\n- f is differentiable.\n\nFor proving derivative of odd function is even:\n- g is odd,\n- g is differentiable.\n\nTherefore, combined, the assumptions are those four. So:\n\nAssumption:\nf is an even function,\nf is differentiable,\ng is an odd function,\ng is differentiable.\n\nProblem: Show that the derivative of f is odd and the derivative of g is even.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each assumption is a single property applied to one object. So that's four assumptions. Then the problem is as stated.",
