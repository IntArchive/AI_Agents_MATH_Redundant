    "Content": "If we have a feasible space for a given LPP (linear programming problem), how is it that its optimum solution lies on one of the corner points of the graphical solution? (I am here concerned only with those LPP's which have a graphical solution with more than one corner/end point.) I was asked to take this as a lemma in the class, but got curious about the proof. Any help is sincerely appreciated.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "In two dimensional case the linear optimization (linear programming) is specified as follows: Find the values $(x, y)$ such that the goal function \n$$g(x, y) = a x + b y \\;\\;\\; (Eq. 1)$$\nis maximized (or minimized) subject to the linear inequalities\n$$a_1 x + b_1 y + c_1 \\ge 0 \\;\\; (or \\le 0) $$\n$$a_2 x + b_2 y + c_2 \\ge 0 \\;\\; (or \\le 0) $$\n$$ ... $$ Each of these linear inequalities defines a half plane bounded by the line obtained by replacing the inequality by equality. The solution $(x, y)$ that maximizes the goal function must lie in the intersection of all these halfplanes which is obviously a convex polygon. This polygon is called the feasible region. Let the value of the goal function at a point $(x, y)$ of the feasible region be $m$\n$$g(x, y) = a x + b y = m \\;\\;\\; (Eq. 2)$$\nThe value $m$ of the goal function will obviously not change when we move $(x, y$) on the line\ndefined by (Eq. 2). But the value of $g()$ will be increased when we increase $m$. This leads to a new line which is parallel to (E.q. 2). We can do this as long as the line contains at least one point of the feasible region. We conclude that the maximum of the goal function is achieved at an extreme point of the feasible region which - for a convex polygon - is a vertex (or an edge when the goal line is parallel to the restriction line going through the extreme vertex).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to know why the optimal solution of a linear programming problem (LPP) lies at one of the corner points of the feasible region, especially when there are multiple corners. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the assumptions of linear programming. The feasible region is a convex polyhedron formed by the intersection of linear inequalities. The objective function is also linear. \n\nIn two variables, this region is a polygon, and the corners are extreme points. The key idea is that a linear function's extrema over a convex set occur at the extreme points. Since the objective is linear, moving along an edge doesn't improve the value beyond what's achieved at the endpoints.\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions \"graphical solution,\" which implies two variables. So the feasible space is a polygon. The optimum (max or min) should be at a vertex. If the objective function is parallel to an edge, then all points on that edge are optimal, but those are still corners (vertices) included.\n\nSo the assumptions here are that the LPP has a feasible region which is a convex polyhedron (from linear constraints) and the objective function is linear. Also, the problem specifies that there's a graphical solution with multiple corner points, so we're dealing with a bounded feasible region, probably in two dimensions.\n\nNow, to structure the problem according to the required format. The original question asks why the optimum is at a corner point. The assumptions need to list each condition applied to one object. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The problem is a linear programming problem (LPP). \n2. The feasible space is non-empty (since it's given as feasible).\n3. The feasible space is a convex polyhedron (from linear constraints).\n4. The objective function is linear.\n5. The graphical solution has more than one corner point (so it's a polyhedron with vertices, not a single point or unbounded).\n\nBut the user's example didn't include all possible assumptions, just the ones relevant. Let me check the example again. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer and divisible by 7, but the original problem only mentioned n is an integer. Wait, the original problem didn't state n divisible by 7; that must have been part of the assumptions filtered. Wait, no, the original problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem's assumptions listed n is an integer and n divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect because 91 is 7*13, so perhaps the problem was split into assumptions that n is integer and maybe another condition. Wait, maybe the example had a mistake, but the user's instruction says to filter unrelated info. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the original problem had a typo or the assumption was added incorrectly. Anyway, focusing back on the current problem.\n\nThe key assumptions here are:\n\n- Feasible space exists (given).\n- The LPP has a graphical solution with more than one corner point (so it's a two-variable problem with a polygonal feasible region).\n- The objective function is linear.\n- The feasible region is a convex polyhedron (from linear constraints).\n\nBut the problem states \"lemma\" that the optimum is at a corner. So the assumptions are the standard LPP conditions: linear objective, linear constraints forming a convex feasible region, and the feasible region has multiple corner points (vertices). \n\nSo structuring the assumptions:\n\nAssumption: \nThe problem is a linear programming problem,\nThe feasible space is non-empty,\nThe feasible space is a convex polyhedron,\nThe objective function is linear,\nThe graphical solution has more than one corner point.\n\nBut each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. Maybe split into:\n\n- The problem is a linear programming problem.\n- The feasible space is non-empty.\n- The feasible space is formed by linear constraints.\n- The feasible space has more than one corner point.\n- The objective function is linear.\n\nWait, \"formed by linear constraints\" is part of LPP definition, so maybe redundant. Since LPP by definition has linear constraints and linear objective. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe problem is a linear programming problem,\nThe feasible space is non-empty,\nThe feasible space has more than one corner point.\n\nBut the key point is that in LPP, the feasible region is a convex polyhedron due to linear constraints. So perhaps the necessary assumptions are:\n\n- The problem is a linear programming problem (hence, linear constraints and linear objective).\n- The feasible space is non-empty.\n- The feasible space has a graphical solution with more than one corner point (i.e., it's a convex polygon with vertices).\n\nSo the structured problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe problem is a linear programming problem,\nThe feasible space is non-empty,\nThe feasible space has a graphical solution with more than one corner point,\nThe objective function is linear.\n\nProblem:\nProve that its optimum solution lies on one of the corner points of the graphical solution.\n\nBut wait, the original question says \"how is it that its optimum solution lies on one of the corner points...\". The user was told to take this as a lemma. So the problem is to prove the lemma under the given assumptions.\n\nSo final answer:",
