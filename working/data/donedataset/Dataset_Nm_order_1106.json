    "Content": "I am self-studying measure theory and I have seen this theorem: If $A$ is a set of positive measure, then there exists a subset $D$ of $A$ that is non measurable. I am not sure how to prove it. I have read the article about Vitali set in here . If $V(0,1)$ represents the Vitali set constructed in the interval $[0,1]$. Then isn't that $V=\\bigcup_{n\\in \\mathbb Z} V(n,n+1)$ be a non measurable set? If so, whether $D=V\\cap A$ is the desirable subset of $A$ which is non measurable?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This presentation is essentially repeated from \"Measure and Integral\" by Wheeden and Zygmund. The function $\\lvert \\cdot \\rvert_e$ denotes outer measure. It can be proven that if $E$ is a measurable subset of $\\mathbb{R}$ with positive measure, then the set of differences $\\{ x-y \\ \\lvert \\ x,y \\in E \\}$ contains an interval at the origin. The proof is in this answer as well as the book referenced: https://math.stackexchange.com/a/104126/35667 . Let $A \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ be a set with positive outer measure. Let $E_r$ be the Vitali set on the real line translated by $r$, i.e. a set of representatives of equivalence classes of $\\mathbb{R} / \\mathbb{Q}$. For $r,q$ rational, $r \\ne q$, we have $E_r \\cap E_q$ is empty, and $\\cup_{r \\in \\mathbb{Q}} E_r = \\mathbb{R}$. So $A = \\cup_r (A \\cap E_r)$, and $\\lvert A \\rvert_e \\leq \\sum_r \\lvert A \\cap E_r \\rvert_e$. Now if $A \\cap E_r$ is measurable, then it must have measure $0$ by the preceding paragraph since its set of differences contains no interval at the origin (any two elements of this set differ by an irrational number). But since $\\lvert A \\rvert_e > 0$, we must have $A \\cap E_r$ with positive outer measure for some $r$. Then this $A \\cap E_r$ is the desired nonmeasurable set. This can be extended to $\\mathbb{R}^n$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to help structure this problem from the Math Stack Exchange question. Let's start by reading through the original question carefully. The user is asking about proving that every set of positive measure has a non-measurable subset. They mention the Vitali set construction and suggest taking the intersection of a Vitali set union with the set A.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The problem states that A is a set of positive measure. So the main assumption here is about the measure of A. The user is then trying to construct a non-measurable subset D of A. They reference the Vitali set, which is typically constructed in [0,1] using translation by rationals, which makes it non-measurable.\n\nBut wait, the user's idea is to take the union of Vitali sets shifted by integers, V = union of V(n, n+1) for n in Z. Then intersect this V with A to get D. The question is whether this D is non-measurable.\n\nHowever, when structuring the problem, I need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. The original problem's assumption is that A is a set with positive measure. The user's proposed approach involves the Vitali set, but the problem itself doesn't specify that A is in the real numbers or anything else. But in measure theory, especially Lebesgue measure, we usually work in R or R^n. So maybe there's an implicit assumption about the space being R with Lebesgue measure.\n\nBut the user's question is more about whether their approach is correct. However, when structuring the problem as per the example, the assumptions should be those given in the problem statement, not the user's attempt. The original problem is to prove that if A has positive measure, then there exists a non-measurable subset D of A. So the main assumption is A is a set of positive (Lebesgue) measure.\n\nWait, the example given by the user includes an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in the original problem, the user might have included extra conditions. Wait, no. The example was the formatted problem, where the original problem had the user state \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. Then the formatted problem in the example lists assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe there was a mistake in the example. Wait, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem's assumption includes n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Wait, perhaps the example was incorrect. But regardless, the task is to structure the current problem given.\n\nSo, back to the current problem. The user is asking to prove that if A is a set of positive measure, then there exists a non-measurable subset D of A. The assumptions would be:\n\n- A is a set (in the real numbers, assuming the context is Lebesgue measure)\n- A has positive Lebesgue measure.\n\nBut the problem as stated in the title and question doesn't specify the measure space, but typically in such questions, it's about Lebesgue measure on the real line. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption: A is a subset of the real numbers with positive Lebesgue measure.\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists a subset D of A that is non-measurable.\n\nBut the user's approach is to use the Vitali set. However, the problem as posed doesn't mention the Vitali set; that's part of the user's attempt. So when structuring the problem, we need to extract the original problem's assumptions and problem statement, not the user's thoughts or attempts.\n\nOriginal problem statement: \"If A is a set of positive measure, then there exists a subset D of A that is non measurable.\" The user is self-studying measure theory and is unsure how to prove it. They then propose an approach involving Vitali sets.\n\nSo the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption: A is a set with positive Lebesgue measure.\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists a subset D of A that is non-measurable.\n\nBut in the example provided, the assumption was split into two lines: \"$n$ is an integer,\" and \"$n$ is divisible by $7$.\" However, in the original problem, the user had \"for every integer n\", which didn't require n to be divisible by 7. The example might have been a mistake. But perhaps the user intended to structure the problem with specific assumptions. Wait, maybe the example was for a different problem where the user had a specific condition. Hmm, maybe the example had a typo or mistake.\n\nIn any case, the current problem's assumptions are:\n\n1. A is a subset of the real numbers.\n2. A has positive Lebesgue measure.\n\nBut the problem statement is to prove that there exists a non-measurable subset D of A. So the assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption: A is a subset of the real numbers with positive Lebesgue measure.\n\nBut perhaps split into two lines as per the example's format, even though in this case, the assumption is a single condition on A. Wait, the example had two assumptions: \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But in the original problem, the user had \"for every integer n\", which didn't include the divisibility. So perhaps the example was incorrect, but the instruction says each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo here, the assumptions for the current problem would be:\n\n- A is a subset of the real numbers.\n- A has positive Lebesgue measure.\n\nBut maybe the first is redundant if we're working within the standard Lebesgue measure context. However, to be precise, perhaps:\n\nAssumption: A is a Lebesgue measurable set.\nAssumption: A has positive Lebesgue measure.\n\nWait, but the problem is to find a non-measurable subset, so the set A itself must be measurable (otherwise, if A is non-measurable, any subset might not help). Wait, no. The problem states that A has positive measure, which usually implies that A is measurable (since measure is defined for measurable sets). So the assumptions would be:\n\n- A is a Lebesgue measurable set.\n- The Lebesgue measure of A is positive.\n\nTherefore, each of these is a separate condition on A. So structuring them line by line:\n\nAssumption: A is a Lebesgue measurable set.\nAssumption: The Lebesgue measure of A is positive.\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists a subset D of A that is non-measurable.\n\nAlternatively, since in standard terminology, saying \"A has positive measure\" already implies that A is measurable (since otherwise, its measure isn't defined). So maybe the first assumption is redundant. But to follow the example's format, where each assumption is a single property on one object, perhaps splitting it into two:\n\nAssumption: A is a subset of the real numbers.\nAssumption: A has positive Lebesgue measure.\n\nBut in measure theory, the measure is defined on measurable sets, so the second assumption implies A is measurable. Therefore, the correct assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption: A is a Lebesgue measurable set.\nAssumption: The Lebesgue measure of A is positive.\n\nBut perhaps the user's original problem didn't specify the measure space, but given the reference to Vitali sets, which are in the real numbers, we can assume the context is real numbers with Lebesgue measure.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: A is a Lebesgue measurable subset of the real numbers.\nAssumption: The Lebesgue measure of A is positive.\nProblem: Prove that there exists a subset D of A that is non-measurable.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption line is a single condition applied to one object. So \"A is a Lebesgue measurable subset of the real numbers\" can be considered as one assumption. Then \"The Lebesgue measure of A is positive\" as another. Alternatively, maybe the user would write:\n\nAssumption: A is a set with positive Lebesgue measure.\n\nBut that combines both the measurability and the positivity of measure. However, in the example, the user split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" into two assumptions. So perhaps for this problem, if \"A is a set with positive Lebesgue measure\" is considered a single assumption, but the example suggests splitting. Wait, but in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem listed two separate assumptions. Wait, maybe the original problem in the example had a mistake, but following the user's instruction, each assumption should be a single property.\n\nSo for the current problem:\n\nAssumption: A is a Lebesgue measurable set.\nAssumption: The Lebesgue measure of A is positive.\nProblem: Prove that there exists a subset D of A that is non-measurable.\n\nAlternatively, if the first assumption is that A is a subset of the real numbers, and the second is that it has positive measure, but then we need to specify that the measure is Lebesgue. So:\n\nAssumption: A is a subset of the real numbers.\nAssumption: A has positive Lebesgue measure.\nProblem: Prove that there exists a subset D of A that is non-measurable.\n\nBut in measure theory, when we say a set has positive Lebesgue measure, it's implied that it's measurable. So maybe the first assumption is redundant. But to be explicit, perhaps list both.\n\nHowever, the user's original question didn't mention the space, but the user's attempt refers to Vitali sets in [0,1] and their union over integers. So the problem is set in the real numbers with Lebesgue measure.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatted problem is:\n\nAssumption: A is a Lebesgue measurable set.\nAssumption: The Lebesgue measure of A is positive.\nProblem: Prove that there exists a subset D of A that is non-measurable.\n\nAlternatively, combining into one assumption if possible. But the example split into two lines. For instance, in the example, the original problem was about every integer n, but the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". That suggests that even if the original problem said \"for every integer n\", the formatted assumptions listed specific conditions. But maybe the example had a mistake. Given that, perhaps for the current problem, the correct assumptions are:\n\nAssumption: A is a set of positive Lebesgue measure.\n\nBecause \"set of positive measure\" already implies it's measurable. So in that case, the formatted problem is:\n\nAssumption: A is a set with positive Lebesgue measure.\nProblem: Prove that there exists a subset D of A that is non-measurable.\n\nBut in the example, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake unless the original problem had a typo. But perhaps the user wants to split the assumptions into separate lines even if they are part of the same original condition. For example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are two separate conditions. Similarly, here, \"A is a set with positive Lebesgue measure\" can be split into two: \"A is a Lebesgue measurable set\" and \"The Lebesgue measure of A is positive.\"\n\nBut in the example, the original problem's assumption was that n is any integer, but the formatted problem added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, the original example's problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem in the example lists assumptions as n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That seems like an error unless the user wanted to restrict to n divisible by 7. But the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the formatted problem's assumptions should not include n divisible by 7. Therefore, the example might be incorrect. But perhaps I should focus on the current problem.\n\nIn any case, for the current problem, the correct assumptions are that A has positive Lebesgue measure, which implies it's measurable. Therefore, splitting into two assumptions:\n\nAssumption: A is a Lebesgue measurable set.\nAssumption: The Lebesgue measure of A is positive.\nProblem: Prove that there exists a subset D of A that is non-measurable.\n\nAlternatively, if we follow that \"A has positive Lebesgue measure\" is a single assumption, then:\n\nAssumption: A has positive Lebesgue measure.\nProblem: Prove that there exists a subset D of A that is non-measurable.\n\nBut to adhere to the example's structure where each assumption is a single property, even if they're related, we should split them. However, in the example, the user split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", which are separate conditions. For the current problem, \"A is Lebesgue measurable\" and \"A has positive measure\" are two separate conditions. So splitting them makes sense.\n\nThus, the final formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption: A is a Lebesgue measurable set.\nAssumption: The Lebesgue measure of A is positive.\nProblem: Prove that there exists a subset D of A that is non-measurable.",
