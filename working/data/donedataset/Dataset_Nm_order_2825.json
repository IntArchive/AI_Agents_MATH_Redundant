    "Content": "Problem: Prove that $1^2+2^2+\\cdots+n^2=\\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. My work: So I think I have to do a proof by induction and I just wanted some help editing my proof. My attempt: Let $P(n)=1^2+2^2+\\cdots+n^2=\\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. \nThen $$P(1)=1^2=\\frac{1(1+1)(2+1)}{6}$$\n$$1=\\frac{6}{6}.$$\nSo $P(1)$ is true. Next suppose that $P(k)=1^2+2^2+\\cdots+k^2=\\frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6}$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Then adding $(k+1)^2$ to both sides of $P(k)$ we obtain the following:\n$$1^2+2^2+\\cdots+k^2+(k+1)^2=\\frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6}+(k+1)^2$$\n$$=\\frac{2k^3+3k^2+k+6(k^2+2k+1)}{6}$$\n$$=\\frac{2k^3+9k^2+13k+6}{6}$$\n$$=\\frac{(k^2+3k+2)(2k+3)}{6}$$\n$$=\\frac{(k+1)(k+2)(2k+3)}{6}$$\n$$=\\frac{(k+1)((k+1)+1)(2(k+1)+1)}{6}$$\n$$=P(k+1).$$\nThus $P(k)$ is true for $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\nHence by mathematical induction, $1^2+2^2+\\cdots+n^2=\\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$ is true for $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I am going to provide what I think is a nice way of writing up a proof, both in terms of accuracy and in terms of communication. You be the judge(s). Claim: For $n\\geq 1$, let $S(n)$ be the statement\n$$\nS(n) : 1^2+2^2+3^2+\\cdots+n^2=\\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}.\n$$ Base step $(n=1)$: The statement $S(1)$ says $1^2=1(2)(3)/6$ which is true. Inductive step $(S(k)\\to S(k+1))$: Fix some $k\\geq 1$ and suppose that\n$$\nS(k) : 1^2+2^2+3^2+\\cdots+k^2=\\frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6}\n$$\nholds. To be shown is that\n$$\nS(k+1) : 1^2+2^2+3^2+\\cdots+k^2+(k+1)^2=\\frac{(k+1)(k+2)(2(k+1)+1)}{6}\n$$\nfollows. Starting with the left-hand side of $S(k+1)$,\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{LHS} &= 1^2+2^2+3^2+\\cdots+k^2+(k+1)^2\\tag{definition}\\\\[1em]\n  &= \\frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6}+(k+1)^2\\tag{by $S(k)$}\\\\[1em]\n  &= (k+1)\\left[\\frac{k(2k+1)}{6}+(k+1)\\right]\\\\[1em]\n  &= (k+1)\\frac{k(2k+1)+6(k+1)}{6}\\\\[1em]\n  &= (k+1)\\frac{2k^2+k+6k+6}{6}\\\\[1em]\n  &= (k+1)\\frac{2k^2+7k+6}{6}\\\\[1em]\n  &= (k+1)\\frac{(k+2)(2k+3)}{6}\\\\[1em]\n  &= \\frac{(k+1)(k+2)(2(k+1)+1)}{6}\\\\[1em]\n  &= \\text{RHS},\n\\end{align}\nthe right-hand side of $S(k+1)$ follows. This completes the inductive step. Thus, by mathematical induction, for every $n\\geq 1, S(n)$ is true. $\\Box$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should list each condition applied to one object, and then the problem statement. \n\nLooking at the original problem in the example, the user had an assumption that \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Then the problem statement was to prove divisibility by 91. However, in the current problem, the question is to prove the formula for the sum of squares using induction. The original problem states that n is a natural number. \n\nSo, first, I need to list the assumptions. The problem mentions \"for n ∈ ℕ\", which means n is a natural number. The assumptions should be broken down into single properties per line. In this case, the only assumption is that n is a natural number. But wait, maybe in the original problem's example, they split into two assumptions because there were two conditions? Wait, no, in the example, the user had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as two separate assumptions. But in the current problem, the problem is for n in natural numbers. So the only assumption here is that n is a natural number. There's no other condition given.\n\nTherefore, the Assumption section should list that n is a natural number. Then the problem is to prove the given formula. The user's work shows they used induction, but the problem itself is just the statement to prove. So the formatted problem should have the assumption that n is a natural number and the problem statement to prove the sum equals that fraction.\n\nWait, the example had assumptions split into two lines even though the original problem only stated \"for every integer n\", but then in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, let me check the example again. The original problem in the example was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, the assumptions included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, perhaps there was a mistake in the example? Because the original problem didn't state that n must be divisible by 7. Wait, maybe the example was modified to include an extra assumption. Hmm. \n\nWait, maybe the example's original problem had a different condition. Let me read again. The original example's problem was: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem's assumptions were \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" So that seems like the user made a mistake because the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7. Wait, perhaps that was a typo or an error in the example. Because if the problem states \"for every integer n\", then the assumption shouldn't include that n is divisible by 7 unless there's a specific condition. But maybe the original example's problem had a different condition. Alternatively, maybe the example is incorrect. \n\nBut regardless, I have to follow the user's instruction. The task is to structure the current problem as per the format. The current problem is: Prove that 1² + 2² + ... +n² = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6 for n ∈ ℕ. The user's own work shows that they used induction, but the problem statement itself is just to prove the formula. \n\nSo the assumptions here would be that n is a natural number. Since the problem states \"for n ∈ ℕ\", which is the set of natural numbers. So the assumption is n is a natural number. The problem is to prove the equation. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a natural number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$1^2 + 2^2 + \\cdots + n^2 = \\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nWait, but in the example, they split into two assumptions even though the original problem didn't state both. Wait, perhaps in the example, there was a mistake. But according to the instructions, the user wants to filter the unrelated information and structure the problem. The original problem here is straightforward: prove the sum equals that formula for n in natural numbers. There are no other hidden assumptions. So the only assumption is that n is a natural number. Therefore, the formatted problem should have that single assumption.",
