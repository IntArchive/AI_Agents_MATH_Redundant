    "AcceptedAnswer": "The proof mentioned by Frederik and Loronegro is great because it provides a first example of how it can be useful to know that two functors are adjoint : left adjoints are right exact. However, you can also argue as follows. Let $D$ be the image of $\\alpha \\otimes \\operatorname{id}$. You get an induced map $(B \\otimes M)/D \\to C \\otimes M$. Let's try to define an inverse: if $(c, m) \\in C \\times M$ then choose a $b \\in B$ such that $\\beta(b) = c$, and send $(c, m)$ to $b \\otimes m \\bmod D$. You can check that this is well defined using the exactness of the original sequence.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to break down this problem. The user wants to prove that the tensor product is right exact. Specifically, given an exact sequence of left R-modules: A → B → C → 0, and another left R-module M, they need to show that the induced sequence A⊗M → B⊗M → C⊗M → 0 is exact. The main issue they're facing is showing that the kernel of β⊗Id is contained within the image of α⊗Id. \n\nFirst, let's recall what right exactness means. A functor is right exact if it preserves the exactness of right-aligned sequences. In this case, the original sequence ends with → C → 0, and after tensoring with M, the sequence should still end with → C⊗M → 0 being exact. The user is stuck on the part where ker(β⊗Id) should be a subset of im(α⊗Id). \n\nThey mention that if β(b)⊗m = 0 implied either β(b)=0 or m=0, then it would be straightforward, but they realize this isn't true. Their example is with C3⊗Z/2Z, where a generator g of C3 (which I assume is the cyclic group of order 3) when squared and tensored with 1 gives zero because 2 in Z/2Z is 0. This shows that even if neither β(b) nor m is zero, their tensor product can still be zero. So the user is correct that their initial approach is flawed.\n\nNow, to approach the problem correctly, maybe they need to use the universal property of tensor products or some other properties related to exactness. When a tensor c⊗m is zero, it doesn't necessarily mean c or m is zero. Instead, it means that there are relations in the tensor product coming from the bilinear relations. To handle this, one common technique is to use generators and relations or to consider the exactness at B⊗M.\n\nThe key step in proving right exactness for the tensor product usually involves showing that every element in the kernel of β⊗Id can be written as a sum of elements that come from α⊗Id. Since the original sequence is exact at B, the kernel of β is the image of α. So elements in ker(β⊗Id) are those in (im α)⊗M. However, this isn't directly obvious because the image of α⊗Id is generated by α(a)⊗m for a ∈ A and m ∈ M, but elements in ker(β⊗Id) are those ∑b_i⊗m_i where ∑β(b_i)⊗m_i = 0 in C⊗M. \n\nTo proceed, perhaps we need to use the fact that the tensor product is right exact by construction, but the user is asking for a proof. One standard method is to use the characterization of the tensor product as a right adjoint functor (Hom-Tensor adjunction), which automatically preserves colimits, hence right exact. But maybe the user expects a more hands-on approach.\n\nAlternatively, consider building a homomorphism from C⊗M to the cokernel of α⊗Id and show it's an isomorphism. Or use the snake lemma, but that might be more involved. Another approach is to use the fact that the image of α⊗Id is contained in the kernel of β⊗Id (which is straightforward), and then show the reverse inclusion by taking an element in the kernel and expressing it as an image under α⊗Id. \n\nBut how? Let's think. Suppose we have an element ∑ b_i ⊗ m_i in B⊗M such that ∑ β(b_i) ⊗ m_i = 0 in C⊗M. The challenge is to express ∑ b_i ⊗ m_i as ∑ α(a_j) ⊗ m'_j for some a_j in A and m'_j in M. \n\nTo do this, we might use the fact that the original sequence is exact, so β is surjective. Since β is surjective, every element in C can be written as β(b) for some b ∈ B. But when ∑ β(b_i) ⊗ m_i = 0, this means that the combination ∑ β(b_i) ⊗ m_i is zero in C⊗M. The key is that this combination can be expressed as a combination of relations in the tensor product. \n\nIn general, if ∑ c_i ⊗ m_i = 0 in C⊗M, then there exist elements in C and relations from the module structure that allow us to express this sum as zero. However, translating this back to B⊗M requires lifting these relations through β. Since β is surjective, we can lift elements from C to B, but the relations might involve elements in the kernel of β, which by exactness, are images of α. \n\nThis seems like the right path. So, if ∑ β(b_i)⊗m_i =0 in C⊗M, then by the properties of the tensor product, this sum can be written as a combination of relations of the form β(b)⊗rm - β(rb)⊗m or β(b)⊗(m + m') - β(b)⊗m - β(b)⊗m', etc., but since we're working in C⊗M, these relations are already factored out. However, since β is surjective, we can use the fact that C⊗M is isomorphic to (B/im α)⊗M. Then, using the right exactness, the sequence A⊗M → B⊗M → (B/im α)⊗M →0 is exact. But I think this is circular because we're trying to prove right exactness.\n\nAlternatively, consider the map B⊗M → C⊗M. The kernel of this map is generated by elements of the form b⊗m where β(b)=0. Since the original sequence is exact, β(b)=0 implies b=α(a) for some a ∈ A. Therefore, any such element b⊗m is equal to α(a)⊗m, which is in the image of α⊗Id. For linear combinations, if ∑ β(b_i)⊗m_i =0, then each β(b_i) must be expressible in terms of the relations from the module structure, but since β is surjective, these relations would come from elements in the image of α. Therefore, ∑ b_i⊗m_i can be written as a sum of elements in the image of α⊗Id. \n\nThis is a bit hand-wavy, but the core idea is that because the kernel of β is the image of α, any relation in C⊗M that comes from the kernel must lift to the image of α⊗Id. Therefore, the kernel of β⊗Id is exactly the image of α⊗Id. \n\nThe user's confusion comes from thinking that β(b)⊗m=0 implies β(b)=0 or m=0, which isn't the case. But the key is to use the exactness of the original sequence and the properties of the tensor product to relate the kernels and images appropriately.",
