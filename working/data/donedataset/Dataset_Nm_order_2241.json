    "Content": "I proved part (i) of the following: Proposition 6.3. Let $0 \\to M' \\xrightarrow{\\alpha} M \\xrightarrow{\\beta} M'' \\to 0$ be an exact sequence of $A$-modules. Then i) $M$ is Noetherian $\\iff$ $M'$ and $M'\"$ are Noetherian; ii) $M$ is Artinian $\\iff$ $M'$ and $M''$ are Artinian Proof. We shall prove i); the proof of ii) is similar. $\\implies$: An ascending chain of submodules of $M'$ (or $M''$) gives rise to a chain in $M$, hence is stationary. Can you tell me if my proof of $(i)\\Longleftarrow$ is correct? Here goes: Let $M^\\prime$ and $M^{\\prime \\prime}$ be Noetherian. Let $L_n$ be an ascending chain of submodules in $M$. Then $\\alpha^{-1}(L_n)$ is an ascending chain of submodules in $M^\\prime$. Hence $\\alpha^{-1}(L_n)$ is stationary, that is, $\\alpha^{-1}(L_n) = \\alpha^{-1}(L_{n+1})$ for $n$ large enough. Hence $L_n = L_{n+1}$ for $n$ large enough since $\\alpha$ is injective hence $L_n$ is stationary. The proof given in Atiyah-Macdonald is the following but I don't understand why they need both maps, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$: $\\Longleftarrow$: Let $(L_n)_{n \\ge 1}$ be an ascending chain of submodules of $M$; then $(\\alpha^{-1}(L_n))$ is a chain in $M'$, and $(\\beta(L_n))$ is a chain in $M''$. For large enough $n$ both these chains are stationary, and it follows that the chain $(L_n)$ is stationary. $\\Box$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If this proof worked then we would be able to conclude that a module is Noetherian if it has a Noetherian submodule. This is certainly not the case — as a silly example, the trivial submodule is always Noetherian. If we forget about $\\beta$ then it is true that $(\\alpha^{-1}(L_n))_n$ will stabilize, but it's not as if $\\alpha(\\alpha^{-1}(L_n)) = L_n$, since $\\alpha$ need not be surjective. To use Atiyah and MacDonald's proof, you want to show that if $N_1 \\subset N_2$ are submodules of $M$ such that $\\alpha^{-1}(N_1) = \\alpha^{-1}(N_2)$ and $\\beta(N_1) = \\beta(N_2)$, then $N_1 = N_2$. For this, take $x \\in N_2$. By assumption there is a $y \\in N_1$ such that $\\beta(y) = \\beta(x)$. By exactness, then, there is a $z \\in M'$ such that $\\alpha(z) = x - y \\in N_2$. Thus $z \\in \\alpha^{-1}(N_2) = \\alpha^{-1}(N_1)$. Do you see how to conclude that $x \\in N_1$? [We do need that $N_1 \\subset N_2$, by the way. Think about $M = \\mathbb R^2$ with $M' = \\text{the $x$-axis}$ and the family of lines $y = mx$ for $m \\neq 0$.]",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So the user is asking about the proof of part (i) of Proposition 6.3 in Atiyah-Macdonald, specifically the converse direction where if M' and M'' are Noetherian, then M is Noetherian. They presented their own proof and are wondering why the original proof uses both α and β, while their own only uses α. Let me parse this step by step.\n\nFirst, the exact sequence given is 0 → M' → M → M'' → 0. The user's approach is to take an ascending chain L_n in M, then consider the preimages under α, which are α⁻¹(L_n) in M'. Since M' is Noetherian, this chain stabilizes, so α⁻¹(L_n) = α⁻¹(L_{n+1}) for large n. Then, because α is injective, they conclude L_n = L_{n+1}. However, the book's proof uses both α⁻¹(L_n) in M' and β(L_n) in M''. The user is confused why both are needed when their own proof seems to work with just α.\n\nLet me recall that in exact sequences, especially short exact sequences, the properties often require considering both the image and the kernel. In this case, the exactness means that α is injective, β is surjective, and im α = ker β. \n\nIn the user's proof, they take the preimage under α of L_n. But since α is injective, α⁻¹(L_n) would correspond to the intersection of L_n with the image of α, which is a submodule of M'. However, when you have an ascending chain L_n in M, the images β(L_n) in M'' form an ascending chain there, which must stabilize because M'' is Noetherian. \n\nSo perhaps the user's proof is missing something. Let's think: if α⁻¹(L_n) stabilizes, does that necessarily mean L_n stabilizes? Suppose that after some n, α⁻¹(L_n) stops growing. But L_n could still be increasing in parts of M not in the image of α. Wait, but M is an extension of M'' by M', so every element of M can be written as something in the image of α plus something that maps to M''? Wait, no, because in modules, extensions can be more complicated. However, given the exact sequence, any element in M when mapped via β lands in M'', and the kernel of β is the image of α. \n\nSo if we have L_n a chain in M, then β(L_n) is a chain in M''. Since M'' is Noetherian, β(L_n) stabilizes. Also, α⁻¹(L_n) is a chain in M', which stabilizes. Now, the key is that if both the preimage under α and the image under β stabilize, then L_n itself must stabilize. \n\nThe user's proof only considered the preimage under α. But maybe there's a case where α⁻¹(L_n) stabilizes, but L_n keeps growing in a part that maps to M''. For example, suppose L_n is such that their images under β keep increasing in M''. But since M'' is Noetherian, β(L_n) must stabilize, so after some point, β(L_n) = β(L_{n+1}). Then, combining that with α⁻¹(L_n) stabilizing, we can apply the snake lemma or some diagram chase. \n\nAlternatively, suppose we have two consecutive modules L_n and L_{n+1} with β(L_n) = β(L_{n+1}) and α⁻¹(L_n) = α⁻¹(L_{n+1}). Then, to show L_n = L_{n+1}, take an element x in L_{n+1}. Since β(L_n) = β(L_{n+1}), there exists a y in L_n such that β(y) = β(x). Then β(x - y) = 0, so x - y is in ker β = im α. Therefore, x - y = α(z) for some z in M'. But α(z) = x - y ∈ L_{n+1}, since x ∈ L_{n+1} and y ∈ L_n ⊆ L_{n+1}. Therefore, z ∈ α⁻¹(L_{n+1}) = α⁻¹(L_n) because the preimages have stabilized. Hence z ∈ α⁻¹(L_n), so α(z) ∈ L_n. Therefore, x = y + α(z) ∈ L_n. So L_{n+1} ⊆ L_n, hence they are equal. \n\nThus, both conditions are necessary: the preimage under α stabilizing and the image under β stabilizing. The user's proof only used the preimage under α, which is insufficient because they could have growth in the part of M that maps to M''. The book uses both to ensure that neither part is growing, hence the chain must stabilize. \n\nTherefore, the user's proof is incorrect because it doesn't account for the possibility that L_n could be increasing in the quotient M''. The original proof in Atiyah-Macdonald correctly uses both α⁻¹(L_n) and β(L_n) to cover both the kernel and cokernel parts of the exact sequence.\n\nSo the key assumptions here are the exactness of the sequence, the Noetherian conditions on M' and M'', and the behavior of chains under both α and β. The problem is to verify the converse direction of the proposition, i.e., if M' and M'' are Noetherian, then M is Noetherian.",
