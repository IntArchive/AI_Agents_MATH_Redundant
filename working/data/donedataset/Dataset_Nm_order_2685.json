    "Content": "There is a theorem in Note on Cofibrations by Arne Strøm. It says Let $A$ be a closed subspace of a topological space $X$. Then $(X,A)$ has the HEP if and only if there are (i) a neighborhood $U$ of $A$ which is deformable in $X$ to $A$ rel$A$, i.e. there is an $H:U\\times I\\to X$ s.t. $H(x,0)=x,\\ H(x,1)\\in A,\\ H(a,t)=a$ for all $a\\in A,x\\in X,t\\in I.$ (ii) a map $\\phi:X\\to I$ s.t. $A=\\phi^{-1}(0)$ and $\\phi(x)=1$ for all $x\\notin U$ To show that $(X,A)$ has the HEP, one constructs a retraction $X\\times I\\to A\\times I\\cup X\\times\\{0\\}$. Such a one is given in the proof, namely: $$r(x,t)=\\begin{cases}\n(x,\\ 0), &\\text{ if }\\phi(x)=1\\\\\n(H(x,2(1-\\phi(x))t),\\ 0), &\\text{ if }1/2\\le\\phi(x)<1\\\\\n(H(x,t/(2\\phi(x))),\\ 0), &\\text{ if }0<\\phi(x)\\le1/2,\\ t\\le2\\phi(x)\\\\\n(H(x,1),\\ t-2\\phi(x)), &\\text{ if }0\\le\\phi(x)\\le1/2,\\ t\\ge2\\phi(x)\n\\end{cases}$$ Now, these partial functions could easily be glued to a single continuous function if the domains were closed, but they are not. So, in order to show continuity, especially on the union of the first two domains, that is on\n$\\phi^{-1}\\left[\\left[\\frac12,1\\right]\\right]$, one takes an element $(x,t)$ and shows that the function is continuous at that point. Since\n$\\phi^{-1}[[0,1)]$ is an open subset of $U$ and the homotopy $H$ is only used for $\\phi(x)<1$ in the construction of $r$, we can assume that $U=\\phi^{-1}[[0,1)]$ and is open. Let us define the map\n$$s:\\{x\\in X\\mid\\phi(x)\\ge1/2\\}\\times I\\to X\\times I\\\\\n(x,t)\\mapsto(x,2(1-\\phi(x))t)$$\nThe image of $s$ is the set $S=\\{(x,t)\\mid t\\le2(1-\\phi(x))\\le1\\}$. Now, $r(x,t)$ can written as $(\\tilde Hs(x,t),0)$ where $\\tilde H:S\\to X$ is defined by\n$$\\tilde H(x,t)=\\begin{cases}\nH(x,t)  &\\text{ if }x\\in U\\\\\nx,  &\\text{ if }t=0\n\\end{cases}$$ The map $s$ is continuous, so it would be enough to show continuity of $\\tilde H$. This is only nontrivial for $x\\in\\partial U.$ Then $x\\notin U$ and $\\phi(x)=1$, so $t=0$. I take an open neighborhood $V$ about $x=\\tilde H(x,0)$ and try to find a neighborhood $W$ of $x$ such that $H[W\\times I\\cap S]\\subseteq V$. But how can I find this $W$? Clearly, it must be a subset of $V$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here's another attempt for the tricky case. Your particular concern is to show that the function $r$ extends continuously from $U$ to its boundary $\\partial U$, since all the other cases are obvious. The problem is that $H$ is defined only on $U$. So define:\n$$U' = \\phi^{-1}\\left(\\left[0, \\frac{9}{10}\\right)\\right);$$\n$$\\phi': X \\rightarrow [0,1], \\quad x \\mapsto \\min \\left(\\frac{10}{9}\\phi(x), 1\\right);$$\n$$H' = H \\upharpoonright U' \\times [0,1].$$ Then $(A, X, U', H', \\phi')$ satisfies the hypotheses of the required result, and now we know that $H'$ extends continuously to $\\partial U'$ and beyond. So, as this was the only oustanding problem, we can perform the desired construction of $r$ for $(A, X)$ continuously without loss of generality. Phew!",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions and then the problem statement.\n\nThe original question is about showing the continuity of a partially defined map in the context of a theorem by Arne Strøm regarding the Homotopy Extension Property (HEP). The user provided an example where assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nLooking at the problem, the main goal is to show that the constructed retraction r is continuous, especially on certain parts of the space. The assumptions here would include the given conditions from the theorem, like the existence of the neighborhood U, the homotopy H, and the map φ. Also, the specific definitions of the retraction r and the map s are part of the setup.\n\nLet me list out each assumption one by one:\n\n1. A is a closed subspace of a topological space X.\n2. There exists a neighborhood U of A that is deformable to A relative to A via a homotopy H: U × I → X satisfying H(x,0) = x, H(x,1) ∈ A, and H(a,t) = a for all a ∈ A, x ∈ X, t ∈ I.\n3. There exists a map φ: X → I such that A = φ⁻¹(0) and φ(x) = 1 for all x ∉ U.\n4. The retraction r: X × I → A × I ∪ X × {0} is defined piecewise with four cases based on the values of φ(x) and t.\n5. The map s: {x ∈ X | φ(x) ≥ 1/2} × I → X × I is defined by (x,t) ↦ (x, 2(1 - φ(x))t), with image S = {(x,t) | t ≤ 2(1 - φ(x)) ≤ 1}.\n6. The function r(x,t) can be expressed as (H̃(s(x,t)), 0) where H̃: S → X is defined piecewise depending on whether x ∈ U or t = 0.\n7. Continuity of H̃ needs to be shown, particularly at points x ∈ ∂U where φ(x) = 1 and t = 0.\n\nEach of these points is a separate assumption or condition applied to specific objects (A, X, U, H, φ, r, s, H̃). The problem then is to show the continuity of the retraction r, specifically by proving the continuity of H̃ at the boundary points of U.\n\nI need to ensure that each assumption is a single, concise statement. Let me check again:\n\n- The first assumption is about A being closed in X.\n- The second defines the homotopy H and its properties.\n- The third introduces the map φ with its conditions.\n- The fourth is the definition of the retraction r.\n- The fifth defines the map s and its image S.\n- The sixth re-expresses r using H̃ and s.\n- The seventh specifies where continuity is non-trivial and the approach to prove it.\n\nYes, each addresses one property or object. Now, the problem statement is to show that the retraction r is continuous, particularly by demonstrating the continuity of H̃ at points in the boundary of U.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a closed subspace of a topological space X,\nThere exists a neighborhood U of A deformable to A relative to A via a homotopy H: U × I → X,\nThe homotopy H satisfies H(x,0) = x for all x ∈ U,\nThe homotopy H satisfies H(x,1) ∈ A for all x ∈ U,\nThe homotopy H satisfies H(a,t) = a for all a ∈ A, t ∈ I,\nThere exists a map φ: X → I such that A = φ⁻¹(0),\nThe map φ satisfies φ(x) = 1 for all x ∉ U,\nThe retraction r is defined piecewise based on φ(x) and t,\nThe map s is defined as (x,t) ↦ (x, 2(1 - φ(x))t),\nThe image of s is S = {(x,t) | t ≤ 2(1 - φ(x)) ≤ 1},\nThe function r is expressed as (H̃(s(x,t)), 0) where H̃: S → X is defined piecewise,\nContinuity of H̃ is non-trivial at x ∈ ∂U where φ(x) = 1 and t = 0.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the retraction r is continuous by proving the continuity of H̃ at points in the boundary of U.",
