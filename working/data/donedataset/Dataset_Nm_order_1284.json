    "AcceptedAnswer": "This is a more difficult integral than it appears.  Let's define $$J(a) = \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} dx \\frac{e^{i a x}}{\\sqrt{5}-2 \\cos{x}}$$ Then the integral we seek is $$-\\frac12 J''(0) = \\int_0^{\\pi} dx \\frac{x^2}{\\sqrt{5}-2 \\cos{x}}$$ To evaluate $J(a)$, consider the following contour integral in the complex plane: $$\\oint_C dz \\frac{z^a}{z^2-\\sqrt{5} z+1}$$ where $C$ is a \"keyhole\" unit circle, with the keyhole being about the negative real axis, as pictured below. By the residue theorem, this contour integral is equal to $$-i 2 \\pi \\phi^a$$ where $\\phi = (\\sqrt{5}-1)/2$ is the golden ratio.  On the other hand, the integral is also equal to $$-i J(a) + i 2 \\sin{\\pi a} \\, \\int_0^1 dx \\frac{x^a}{x^2+\\sqrt{5} x+1}$$ Note that the portion of the integral that goes about the center goes to zero.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this integral problem step by step. The problem is to evaluate the integral from 0 to π of (x²)/(√5 - 2cosx) dx, and show that it equals (π³)/15 + 2π times the square of the natural logarithm of (1 + √5)/2. \n\nFirst, I need to recall some techniques for evaluating integrals involving trigonometric functions in the denominator. The denominator here is √5 - 2cosx. That looks a bit like the form of some standard integrals I've seen before, maybe related to Fourier series or some substitution. Alternatively, the presence of cosx in the denominator might suggest using a substitution that can simplify the expression. \n\nWait, the integrand is x² divided by (√5 - 2cosx). The variable x is both in the numerator as x² and in the denominator inside the cosine. This makes it a bit tricky because x is both outside and inside a trigonometric function. If it were just a function of cosx in the denominator, maybe we could use some substitution, but the x² complicates things. \n\nThe user mentioned maybe using the Polylogarithm. Polylogarithms often come into play when integrating functions involving logarithms or trigonometric functions raised to some power. But I'm not sure exactly how to apply them here. Let me think if there's another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe expanding the denominator as a Fourier series or a power series. For example, expressions like 1/(a - b cosx) can sometimes be expanded into a series using the generating function for Chebyshev polynomials or a geometric series. Let me explore that idea.\n\nThe denominator is √5 - 2cosx. Let me write this as sqrt(5) - 2cosx. Let me factor out sqrt(5) to make it 1 - (2/sqrt(5))cosx. Then, the expression becomes sqrt(5)*(1 - (2/sqrt(5))cosx). So the denominator is sqrt(5) times (1 - k cosx) where k = 2/sqrt(5). \n\nNow, 1/(1 - k cosx) can be expanded as a Fourier series if |k| < 1. Let's check the value of k here. Since k = 2/sqrt(5) ≈ 2/2.236 ≈ 0.894, which is less than 1, so the series will converge. That seems promising. \n\nSo, maybe we can write 1/(sqrt(5) - 2cosx) as 1/(sqrt(5)(1 - (2/sqrt(5))cosx) = 1/sqrt(5) * sum_{n=0}^∞ (2/sqrt(5))^n cos^n x. Wait, but the expansion of 1/(1 - k cosx) is actually a Fourier series, not a power series in cosx. Let me recall the correct expansion.\n\nI remember that for |k| < 1, 1/(1 - 2k cosx + k²) = sum_{n=0}^∞ k^n cos(nx). But that's a different form. Wait, maybe I need to use a different expansion. Alternatively, the generating function for the Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind is sum_{n=0}^∞ k^n T_n(x) = (1 - kx)/(1 - 2kx + k²), but I'm not sure if that helps here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the Poisson kernel formula. The Poisson kernel is given by (1 - r²)/(1 - 2r cosx + r²) = sum_{n=-∞}^∞ r^{|n|} e^{inx} for |r| < 1. But integrating x² times such a series might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a substitution that can be made. Let me consider the integral ∫0^π x²/(sqrt(5) - 2cosx) dx. If I can express 1/(sqrt(5) - 2cosx) as an integral or a series, then multiply by x² and integrate term by term. But integrating x² times a series of cos(nx) terms might lead to terms that can be integrated, but x² is a polynomial, so integrating against cos(nx) would involve integration by parts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe differentiation under the integral sign. Let me think. If I consider a parameter in the integral, say, a parameter in the denominator, then differentiate with respect to that parameter to reduce the integral to something manageable. But the denominator here is sqrt(5) - 2cosx. If I let k = 2/sqrt(5), then denominator is sqrt(5)(1 - k cosx). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use contour integration. Since the integral is from 0 to π, which is over a real line, but maybe extending it to 0 to 2π and then using substitution z = e^{ix}, converting the integral into a complex integral. However, the presence of x² complicates things because x is the argument of the cosine and also as a polynomial term. Let me see.\n\nWait, in the integral, x is a real variable from 0 to π. If we let z = e^{ix}, then x = -i ln z, and dx = dz/(iz). But then, cosx = (z + z^{-1})/2. However, substituting x in terms of z would make x² into (-i ln z)^2, which might not be easy to handle. But maybe this approach can work. Let me sketch it.\n\nSo, the integral becomes ∫_{z=1}^{z=-1} [(-i ln z)^2] / [sqrt(5) - 2*(z + z^{-1})/2] * dz/(iz). Simplify the denominator: sqrt(5) - (z + z^{-1}). Multiply numerator and denominator by z to eliminate the z^{-1}: denominator becomes sqrt(5) z - z^2 -1. Then the integral becomes -i ∫_{1}^{-1} [(-i ln z)^2] * z / (sqrt(5) z - z² -1) * dz/(iz). Hmm, this seems messy. Maybe not the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the integral is from 0 to π. Since cosx is symmetric around x=0, maybe we can extend the integral to -π to π and then use some even function properties. But the original integral is from 0 to π, and x² is even, so perhaps not necessary.\n\nWait, another idea: maybe express 1/(sqrt(5) - 2cosx) in terms of an integral or a known function. For example, sometimes expressions like 1/(a - b cosx) can be related to elliptic integrals or other special functions. Alternatively, maybe look for a substitution that can turn the denominator into something simpler.\n\nLet me compute the denominator sqrt(5) - 2cosx. Let me note that sqrt(5) is approximately 2.236, so 2cosx varies between -2 and 2. Therefore, sqrt(5) - 2cosx ranges from sqrt(5) - 2*(-1) = sqrt(5) + 2 ≈ 4.236 down to sqrt(5) - 2*(1) ≈ 0.236. So the denominator is always positive in this interval, which is good because we don't have division by zero.\n\nAnother thought: maybe use the substitution t = π - x, since the integral is from 0 to π. Let me try that. Let x = π - t, then when x=0, t=π; when x=π, t=0. The integral becomes ∫π^0 [ (π - t)^2 / (sqrt(5) - 2cos(π - t)) ] (-dt) = ∫0^π [ (π - t)^2 / (sqrt(5) + 2cos t) ] dt. Since cos(π - t) = -cos t. So the integral is equal to ∫0^π (π - x)^2 / (sqrt(5) + 2cosx) dx. Adding the original integral and this transformed version, we get ∫0^π [x²/(sqrt(5) - 2cosx) + (π - x)^2/(sqrt(5) + 2cosx)] dx. Maybe this can lead to some simplification, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider expanding x² as a Fourier series, but that seems complicated. Alternatively, use integration by parts. Let me try integrating by parts. Let u = x², dv = dx/(sqrt(5) - 2cosx). Then du = 2x dx, and v would be the integral of dv. But integrating dv = dx/(sqrt(5) - 2cosx) is non-trivial. Let me check if I can compute v.\n\nCompute v = ∫ dx/(sqrt(5) - 2cosx). Let me recall that integrals of the form ∫ dx/(a + b cosx) can be solved using the Weierstrass substitution or using standard formulas. The standard integral ∫0^π dx/(a + b cosx) = π / sqrt(a² - b²) if a > |b|. Wait, in our case, the denominator is sqrt(5) - 2cosx, which can be written as a + b cosx where a = sqrt(5), b = -2. Then the integral from 0 to π would be π / sqrt(a² - b²) = π / sqrt(5 - 4) = π / 1 = π. Wait, that's interesting. So ∫0^π dx/(sqrt(5) - 2cosx) = π. \n\nBut in our problem, we have x² times that term. So integrating by parts, with u = x², dv = dx/(sqrt(5) - 2cosx). Then du = 2x dx, and v = ∫0^x dt/(sqrt(5) - 2cos t) + C. But the integral of dv from 0 to x would be v(x) - v(0). Wait, but I'm not sure if that helps. Let me check.\n\nWait, if I let v(x) = ∫0^x dt/(sqrt(5) - 2cos t), then according to the standard integral, ∫0^π dt/(sqrt(5) - 2cos t) = π. So v(π) = π. Then integrating by parts, we have ∫0^π x² dv = [x² v(x)]0^π - ∫0^π v(x) * 2x dx. The first term would be π² * π - 0 = π³. Then subtract 2 ∫0^π x v(x) dx. So the original integral is π³ - 2 ∫0^π x v(x) dx. But now we need to compute ∫0^π x v(x) dx, where v(x) = ∫0^x dt/(sqrt(5) - 2cos t). This seems to lead us into another integral that might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a symmetry or a differential equation approach. Let me consider the integral I = ∫0^π x²/(sqrt(5) - 2cosx) dx. Suppose we define a function I(a) = ∫0^π x²/(a - 2cosx) dx, and then evaluate it at a = sqrt(5). Maybe differentiating I(a) with respect to a could help. Let's see.\n\nFirst, compute dI/da = - ∫0^π x²/(a - 2cosx)^2 dx. Hmm, but this seems to complicate things. Alternatively, integrating I(a) with respect to a. Wait, perhaps integrating I(a) from some lower limit to sqrt(5). Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, note that 1/(a - 2cosx) can be expressed as an integral or a series. For example, using the generating function for the modified Bessel functions? Not sure. Alternatively, expand as a Fourier series. Let me try that.\n\nWe can write 1/(sqrt(5) - 2cosx) as a Fourier cosine series. Since the function is even, we can expand it as sum_{n=0}^∞ c_n cos(nx). The coefficients can be found using orthogonality. For a function f(x) = 1/(a - b cosx), the Fourier coefficients can be calculated. In particular, for f(x) = 1/(a - b cosx), the Fourier series is (1/sqrt(a² - b²)) * sum_{n=0}^∞ (b/(a + sqrt(a² - b²)))^n cos(nx). Wait, I remember such an expansion from potential theory or Fourier series.\n\nLet me verify this. Suppose we have 1/(a - b cosx) = sum_{n=0}^∞ c_n cos(nx). Multiply both sides by (a - b cosx) and equate coefficients. Alternatively, use complex analysis. Let me recall that for |k| < 1, 1/(1 - 2k cosx + k²) = sum_{n=0}^∞ k^n cos(nx). This is a standard generating function. Comparing to our case, maybe we can manipulate 1/(a - b cosx) into a similar form.\n\nLet me set a = sqrt(5), b = 2. So 1/(sqrt(5) - 2 cosx) = 1/sqrt(5) * 1/(1 - (2/sqrt(5)) cosx). Let k = (2/sqrt(5)). Then we have 1/(sqrt(5)) * 1/(1 - k cosx). If we can express 1/(1 - k cosx) as a Fourier series, then we can proceed.\n\nYes, the generating function is 1/(1 - 2k cosx + k²) = sum_{n=0}^∞ k^n cos(nx) for |k| < 1. But here we have 1/(1 - k cosx). Let me see. Let me consider 1/(1 - k cosx). To express this as a Fourier series, perhaps using the identity from generating functions.\n\nAlternatively, use the expansion 1/(1 - k cosx) = sum_{n=0}^∞ (k e^{ix})^n summed from n=0 to ∞ plus sum_{n=1}^\\infty (k e^{-ix})^n. Wait, that would be geometric series:\n\n1/(1 - k cosx) = Real part of sum_{n=0}^∞ (k e^{ix})^n = Re[1/(1 - k e^{ix})] = Re[(1 - k e^{-ix}) / (1 - 2k cosx + k²)]. Wait, this might not be helpful. Alternatively, maybe expand 1/(1 - k cosx) as a Fourier series by noting that it's similar to the generating function for the Chebyshev polynomials.\n\nAlternatively, write k cosx = (k/2)(e^{ix} + e^{-ix}), then 1/(1 - k cosx) = sum_{m=0}^\\infty (k cosx)^m = sum_{m=0}^\\infty k^m cos^m x. But cos^m x can be expressed as a sum of cos(nx) terms using power-reduction formulas. However, this would lead to a double summation, which might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, use the identity that for |k| < 1,\n\n1/(1 - k cosx) = sum_{n=-∞}^∞ k^{|n|} e^{inx} / (1 - k^2)\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Wait, another approach: using the Poisson kernel formula. The Poisson kernel for the unit disk is (1 - r²)/(1 - 2r cosx + r²) = sum_{n=-∞}^\\infty r^{|n|} e^{inx} for |r| < 1. But this is different from our denominator.\n\nAlternatively, since we have 1/(1 - k cosx), maybe we can write it as a sum involving Bessel functions, but I don't recall the exact form.\n\nWait, maybe I can find the Fourier coefficients directly. Let's consider f(x) = 1/(sqrt(5) - 2 cosx). Let me compute the Fourier coefficients c_n = (1/π) ∫0^{2π} f(x) cos(nx) dx. But since our integral is over 0 to π, and the function is even, maybe it's better to compute the coefficients over -π to π. But this might take some time. Alternatively, refer to standard integrals.\n\nWait, I recall that the integral ∫0^{2π} dx/(a + b cosx) = 2π/sqrt(a² - b²). For a > |b|. So in our case, ∫0^{2π} dx/(sqrt(5) - 2 cosx) = 2π/sqrt(5 - 4) = 2π. But our integral is from 0 to π, so it would be π. Which matches the earlier result.\n\nBut to find the Fourier series of f(x) = 1/(sqrt(5) - 2 cosx), we can note that since f(x) is even, the Fourier series will consist of cosine terms only. So let me write f(x) = c_0/2 + sum_{n=1}^\\infty c_n cos(nx). The coefficients c_n can be found by:\n\nc_n = (1/π) ∫_{-π}^\\pi f(x) cos(nx) dx = (2/π) ∫0^\\pi f(x) cos(nx) dx.\n\nBut computing this integral for general n might be challenging. However, there's a standard result for the Fourier coefficients of 1/(a - b cosx). Let me look it up mentally.\n\nI recall that the Fourier coefficients for 1/(a - b cosx) are given by c_n = (1/sqrt(a² - b²)) * ( (sqrt(a² - b²) - a)/b )^{|n| }, but I need to verify this.\n\nAlternatively, consider the generating function approach. Let me set k = (sqrt(a² - b²) - a)/b. Then, perhaps 1/(a - b cosx) can be expressed as a sum over n of k^{|n|} e^{inx}. Let me check for a specific case. Suppose a = sqrt(5), b = 2. Then sqrt(a² - b²) = sqrt(5 -4) = 1. So k = (1 - sqrt(5))/2. Wait, but |k| = |(1 - sqrt(5))/2| ≈ |(1 - 2.236)/2| ≈ 0.618/2 ≈ 0.309, which is less than 1, so the series would converge.\n\nThus, 1/(sqrt(5) - 2 cosx) = sum_{n=-∞}^\\infty k^{|n|} e^{inx} where k = (1 - sqrt(5))/2. But since the function is real and even, this simplifies to c_0 + 2 sum_{n=1}^\\infty c_n cos(nx). Therefore, c_n = k^{n} for n ≥ 0, but with appropriate scaling. Wait, let me compute it properly.\n\nIf we have 1/(sqrt(5) - 2 cosx) = sum_{n=-∞}^\\infty k^{|n|} e^{inx}. Then, because the function is even, this is equal to sum_{n=-∞}^\\infty k^{|n|} cos(nx). Then, grouping the terms, we can write this as k^0 + sum_{n=1}^\\infty k^n (e^{inx} + e^{-inx}) = 1 + sum_{n=1}^\\infty k^n (2 cos(nx)). Therefore, the Fourier series is 1 + 2 sum_{n=1}^\\infty k^n cos(nx), where k = (sqrt(a² - b²) - a)/b. Substituting a = sqrt(5), b = 2, then k = (1 - sqrt(5))/2.\n\nBut we need to confirm this. Let's check the n=0 term. The average value of f(x) over the interval is c_0/2 = (1/(2π)) ∫0^{2π} dx/(sqrt(5) - 2 cosx) = (1/(2π)) * 2π/sqrt(a² - b²) = 1/sqrt(a² - b²) = 1/1 = 1. Therefore, c_0 = 2. But according to our Fourier series, the constant term is 1, so there's a discrepancy. Wait, maybe the expansion is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct expansion is 1/(sqrt(5) - 2 cosx) = (1/sqrt(a² - b²)) sum_{n=0}^\\infty (b/(a + sqrt(a² - b²)) )^n cos(nx). Let's check for a = sqrt(5), b = 2. Then sqrt(a² - b²) = 1. The coefficient becomes (2/(sqrt(5) +1 ))^n. Let's compute 2/(sqrt(5) +1 ). Multiply numerator and denominator by (sqrt(5) -1): 2*(sqrt(5)-1)/( (sqrt(5)+1)(sqrt(5)-1) ) = 2*(sqrt(5)-1)/(5 -1) = 2*(sqrt(5)-1)/4 = (sqrt(5)-1)/2. Which is approximately (2.236 -1)/2 ≈ 0.618, which is the golden ratio conjugate. Let's denote φ = (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ≈ 1.618, so (sqrt(5) -1)/2 = φ -1 ≈ 0.618.\n\nTherefore, the expansion is 1/(sqrt(5) - 2 cosx) = sum_{n=0}^\\infty ( (sqrt(5)-1)/2 )^n cos(nx). \n\nWait, but if a = sqrt(5), b = 2, then the coefficient is (b/(a + sqrt(a² - b²)))^n = (2/(sqrt(5) +1 ))^n = ( (sqrt(5) -1)/2 )^n, as computed. So yes, the expansion is 1/(sqrt(5) - 2 cosx) = sum_{n=0}^\\infty ( (sqrt(5)-1)/2 )^n cos(nx).\n\nTherefore, the denominator can be written as a sum of cos(nx) terms. Then, the integrand x²/(sqrt(5) - 2cosx) can be written as x² * sum_{n=0}^\\infty ( (sqrt(5)-1)/2 )^n cos(nx). \n\nNow, interchanging the sum and the integral (if permissible), we can write the integral as sum_{n=0}^\\infty ( (sqrt(5)-1)/2 )^n ∫0^π x² cos(nx) dx. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to computing ∫0^π x² cos(nx) dx for each n, then summing the series multiplied by the coefficients.\n\nLet me recall that ∫ x² cos(nx) dx can be integrated by parts. Let me compute this integral.\n\nLet In = ∫0^π x² cos(nx) dx. Let's perform integration by parts. Let u = x², dv = cos(nx) dx. Then du = 2x dx, v = sin(nx)/n.\n\nSo, In = [x² sin(nx)/n]0^π - (2/n) ∫0^π x sin(nx) dx.\n\nThe boundary term at x=0 is 0, and at x=π, it's π² sin(nπ)/n. But sin(nπ) is zero for all integers n. Therefore, the boundary term is zero. So, In = - (2/n) ∫0^π x sin(nx) dx.\n\nNow, compute ∫0^π x sin(nx) dx. Again, integrate by parts. Let u = x, dv = sin(nx) dx. Then du = dx, v = -cos(nx)/n.\n\nSo, integral becomes -x cos(nx)/n |0^π + (1/n) ∫0^π cos(nx) dx.\n\nFirst term: -π cos(nπ)/n + 0 = -π (-1)^n /n. Second term: (1/n) * [ sin(nx)/n ]0^π = 0. Therefore, ∫0^π x sin(nx) dx = -π (-1)^n /n.\n\nPlugging back into In: In = - (2/n) * (-π (-1)^n /n ) = (2π (-1)^n ) /n².\n\nTherefore, In = ∫0^π x² cos(nx) dx = (2π (-1)^n)/n².\n\nWait, let me verify this result. For n=0, cos(0x) = 1, so ∫0^π x² dx = π³/3. But according to the formula, for n=0, we have In = ∫0^π x² cos(0x) dx = ∫0^π x² dx = π³/3. However, the formula In = (2π (-1)^n)/n² is undefined for n=0. So, we need to treat n=0 separately.\n\nIn our case, the expansion starts at n=0. Therefore, we need to compute the n=0 term separately. Let's do that.\n\nFor n=0, cos(0x) = 1. Then, In = ∫0^π x² *1 dx = π³/3. For n ≥1, In = (2π (-1)^n)/n².\n\nTherefore, the integral becomes sum_{n=0}^\\infty ( (sqrt(5)-1)/2 )^n In = (π³/3) * ( (sqrt(5)-1)/2 )^0 + sum_{n=1}^\\infty ( (sqrt(5)-1)/2 )^n * (2π (-1)^n)/n².\n\nThe first term is π³/3. The sum from n=1 to ∞ is 2π sum_{n=1}^\\infty [ ( (sqrt(5)-1)/2 )^n * (-1)^n /n² ] = 2π sum_{n=1}^\\infty [ (- (sqrt(5)-1)/2 )^n /n² ].\n\nLet me denote q = - (sqrt(5)-1)/2. Then, the sum becomes 2π sum_{n=1}^\\infty q^n /n². The sum sum_{n=1}^\\infty q^n /n² is known as the dilogarithm function, Li_2(q). Therefore, the integral is π³/3 + 2π Li_2(q), where q = - (sqrt(5)-1)/2.\n\nBut the problem states the answer should be π³/15 + 2π ln²( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ). Therefore, I must have made a mistake somewhere, or there's a relation between the dilogarithm and the squared logarithm term.\n\nLet me compute q: q = - (sqrt(5)-1)/2. Let's compute (sqrt(5)-1)/2 ≈ (2.236 -1)/2 ≈ 1.236/2 ≈ 0.618, so q ≈ -0.618.\n\nBut the dilogarithm function Li_2(q) is related to various identities. In particular, for certain values of q, the dilogarithm can be expressed in terms of logarithms. Let me recall that Li_2(-φ^{-1}) where φ is the golden ratio, which is (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ≈ 1.618. Note that φ = (1 + sqrt(5))/2, so φ^{-1} = (sqrt(5)-1)/2 ≈ 0.618. Therefore, q = -φ^{-1}.\n\nThere is an identity related to the dilogarithm of -φ^{-1}. Let me recall that Li_2(-φ^{-1}) + Li_2(-φ) = -π²/6 - (ln φ)^2. But I need to verify this.\n\nAlternatively, recall that for certain values, the dilogarithm can be expressed in terms of logs. For example, Li_2(z) + Li_2(1-z) = π²/6 - ln z ln(1 - z). But I'm not sure if that helps here.\n\nAlternatively, use the identity for the dilogarithm at reciprocal arguments. There's an identity: Li_2(z) + Li_2(1/z) = -π²/6 - (ln(-z))²/2 for z not on the unit circle. But in our case, q = -φ^{-1} ≈ -0.618, so 1/q ≈ -1.618 = -φ. Let's check:\n\nLi_2(q) + Li_2(1/q) = -π²/6 - (ln(-q))² /2.\n\nBut 1/q = -φ, so Li_2(q) + Li_2(-φ) = -π²/6 - (ln(φ^{-1}))² /2. Since -q = φ^{-1}, ln(-q) = ln(φ^{-1}) = -ln φ. Then, (ln(-q))² = (ln φ^{-1})² = (ln φ)^2.\n\nTherefore, Li_2(q) + Li_2(-φ) = -π²/6 - (ln φ)^2 / 2.\n\nBut Li_2(-φ) is problematic because |φ| > 1, and the dilogarithm series converges only for |z| ≤ 1. So this identity might not hold directly. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, recall that for x < 0, Li_2(x) can be expressed using inversion formulas. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, use the integral representation of the dilogarithm. Li_2(z) = - ∫0^z (ln(1 - t))/t dt.\n\nAlternatively, note that our sum is Li_2(q) = sum_{n=1}^\\infty q^n /n². Let's compute Li_2(q) where q = - (sqrt(5)-1)/2.\n\nLet me denote t = (sqrt(5)-1)/2 ≈ 0.618, so q = -t. Then, Li_2(-t) = sum_{n=1}^\\infty (-t)^n /n².\n\nThere is a known identity for Li_2(-t) when t is the inverse of the golden ratio. Let me look up in my mind some dilogarithm identities. \n\nAh, there's an identity called the dilogarithm identity for the golden ratio: Li_2(1/φ²) = π²/10 - (ln φ)^2. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, I found in some references that Li_2(-φ^{-1}) = -π²/15 + (ln φ)^2. If that's the case, then our sum would be Li_2(q) = Li_2(-φ^{-1}) = -π²/15 + (ln φ)^2. Then, substituting back into our integral:\n\nIntegral I = π³/3 + 2π [ -π²/15 + (ln φ)^2 ] = π³/3 - 2π³/15 + 2π (ln φ)^2.\n\nCalculating π³/3 - 2π³/15 = (5π³/15 - 2π³/15) = 3π³/15 = π³/5. Wait, but the problem states the answer is π³/15 + 2π ln²(φ). So this suggests a discrepancy. Therefore, my assumption about the identity of the dilogarithm must be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the expansion or in the coefficients. Let me retrace the steps.\n\nFirst, the expansion of 1/(sqrt(5) - 2cosx) as a Fourier series: we have 1/(sqrt(5) - 2cosx) = sum_{n=0}^\\infty ( (sqrt(5)-1)/2 )^n cos(nx). Is this correct?\n\nAlternatively, let me check for x=0. At x=0, cosx=1, so the left side is 1/(sqrt(5) - 2). The right side is sum_{n=0}^\\infty ( (sqrt(5)-1)/2 )^n *1. This is a geometric series with ratio ( (sqrt(5)-1)/2 ). Let's compute (sqrt(5)-1)/2 ≈ (2.236-1)/2 ≈ 0.618, which is less than 1, so the series converges to 1/(1 - (sqrt(5)-1)/2 ) = 1/( (2 - sqrt(5)+1)/2 ) = 1/( (3 - sqrt(5))/2 ) = 2/(3 - sqrt(5)) = multiply numerator and denominator by (3 + sqrt(5)): 2(3 + sqrt(5))/ (9 -5) ) = 2(3 + sqrt(5))/4 = (3 + sqrt(5))/2 ≈ (3 + 2.236)/2 ≈ 2.618. However, the left side at x=0 is 1/(sqrt(5) - 2) ≈ 1/(2.236 - 2) ≈ 1/0.236 ≈ 4.236, which is not equal to 2.618. Therefore, my earlier expansion is incorrect.\n\nThis means that the Fourier series coefficients were not correctly derived. This suggests that my approach to expanding 1/(sqrt(5) - 2cosx) as a Fourier series was flawed.\n\nLet me reconsider. Perhaps the correct expansion is different. Let me recall that for 1/(a - b cosx), the Fourier series can be expressed as (1/sqrt(a² - b²)) * sum_{n=0}^\\infty ( (b/(a + sqrt(a² - b²)) )^n cos(nx) ). Let's check this formula with a = sqrt(5), b = 2.\n\nsqrt(a² - b²) = 1, so the coefficient becomes (2/(sqrt(5) +1 ))^n. Let's compute 2/(sqrt(5) +1 ) ≈ 2/(2.236 +1 ) ≈ 2/3.236 ≈ 0.618, which is φ^{-1}, where φ is the golden ratio. Therefore, the expansion is 1/(sqrt(5) - 2cosx) = (1/1) * sum_{n=0}^\\infty (φ^{-1})^n cos(nx). \n\nBut at x=0, sum_{n=0}^\\infty (φ^{-1})^n = 1/(1 - φ^{-1}) = φ/(φ -1 ) = φ, since φ -1 = φ^{-1}. Therefore, sum_{n=0}^\\infty (φ^{-1})^n = φ ≈ 1.618. But the left side at x=0 is 1/(sqrt(5) - 2) ≈ 4.236. This inconsistency indicates that the expansion is missing a scaling factor.\n\nWait, the correct formula should be 1/(a - b cosx) = (1/sqrt(a² - b²)) * sum_{n=0}^\\infty ( (b/(a + sqrt(a² - b²)) )^n cos(nx) ). In our case, a = sqrt(5), b = 2, so 1/(sqrt(5) - 2cosx) = (1/1) * sum_{n=0}^\\infty (2/(sqrt(5)+1 ))^n cos(nx). Let's compute this sum at x=0:\n\nsum_{n=0}^\\infty (2/(sqrt(5)+1 ))^n = 1/(1 - 2/(sqrt(5)+1 )) = (sqrt(5)+1 )/(sqrt(5)+1 -2 ) = (sqrt(5)+1 )/(sqrt(5)-1 ) = multiply numerator and denominator by (sqrt(5)+1 ): (sqrt(5)+1 )² / (5 -1 ) = (5 + 2 sqrt(5) +1 )/4 = (6 + 2 sqrt(5))/4 = (3 + sqrt(5))/2 ≈ (3 + 2.236)/2 ≈ 2.618. Which is indeed equal to (sqrt(5)+1 )/2 ≈ (2.236 +1)/2 ≈ 1.618, wait no, (sqrt(5)+1)/2 is φ, which is approximately 1.618. Wait, but (3 + sqrt(5))/2 is approximately 2.618, which is φ². Because φ² = ((1 + sqrt(5))/2 )² = (1 + 2 sqrt(5) +5)/4 = (6 + 2 sqrt(5))/4 = (3 + sqrt(5))/2 ≈ 2.618. \n\nTherefore, sum_{n=0}^\\infty (2/(sqrt(5)+1 ))^n = (sqrt(5)+1 )/(sqrt(5)-1 ) = φ². But the left side at x=0 is 1/(sqrt(5)-2) = (sqrt(5)+2)/( (sqrt(5)-2)(sqrt(5)+2) ) = (sqrt(5)+2)/(5 -4 ) = sqrt(5)+2 ≈ 2.236 + 2 = 4.236. But according to the expansion, it's sum_{n=0}^\\infty (2/(sqrt(5)+1 ))^n = φ² ≈ 2.618, which does not equal 4.236. Therefore, there's a mistake in the expansion.\n\nThis suggests that the Fourier series expansion I derived earlier is incorrect. Therefore, my approach to expanding the denominator is flawed. I need to find another method.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let's consider using complex analysis. Suppose we let z = e^{ix}, so that cosx = (z + z^{-1})/2. Then, dx = dz/(iz). The integral becomes a contour integral around the unit circle from z=1 to z=-1, but since we're integrating from 0 to π, it's a semicircle. However, the presence of x² complicates things because x is related to the argument of z.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the substitution t = tan(x/2), the Weierstrass substitution. Then, cosx = (1 - t²)/(1 + t²), and dx = 2dt/(1 + t²). But this would transform the integral into a rational function of t, but with x expressed in terms of t as x = 2 arctan t. So x² would become (2 arctan t)^2, which might not lead to a tractable integral.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the integral involves x² times a function that can be related to known integrals. Maybe differentiate a simpler integral with respect to a parameter. For example, suppose we know the integral of x/(sqrt(5) - 2cosx) dx, then differentiate with respect to a parameter to get the x² term. But I'm not sure what parameter to introduce.\n\nWait, let's define I(a) = ∫0^π dx/(a - 2cosx). As we saw earlier, I(a) = π/sqrt(a² -4) for a >2. Then, perhaps differentiating I(a) with respect to a twice would introduce factors of x²? Wait, no, differentiating under the integral sign would give derivatives with respect to a, not x. Let me see:\n\nI(a) = ∫0^π dx/(a - 2cosx). Then, dI/da = - ∫0^π dx/(a - 2cosx)^2. But how does this relate to the integral involving x²?\n\nAlternatively, consider that the original integral is ∫0^π x²/(a - 2cosx) dx, and relate this to the derivatives of I(a). But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, use the fact that integrating x² times a function can sometimes be related to the Fourier transform or moment generating functions, but I'm not sure.\n\nLet me consider another approach. The problem states that the answer is (π³)/15 + 2π ln²( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ). Notice that (1 + sqrt(5))/2 is the golden ratio φ ≈ 1.618. So the answer involves π³ and π times the square of the natural logarithm of φ.\n\nThis suggests that the integral might be split into two parts: one involving π³ and the other involving the logarithmic term. Perhaps there's a way to express the integral as a sum of two terms, one coming from the n=0 term in the Fourier series and the other from the dilogarithm sum.\n\nEarlier, when I tried expanding the denominator as a Fourier series, I obtained an expression involving π³/3 + 2π Li_2(q), but this didn't match the given answer. However, if there's a miscalculation in the Fourier series coefficients or in the dilogarithm identity, this could explain the discrepancy.\n\nLet me re-examine the Fourier series expansion. Suppose the correct expansion is:\n\n1/(sqrt(5) - 2cosx) = sum_{n=0}^\\infty ( (sqrt(5)-2 )^n cos(nx) ). Wait, but (sqrt(5)-2) ≈ 2.236 -2 = 0.236, which is 1/φ². Let's check this. If we expand 1/(sqrt(5) - 2cosx) as sum_{n=0}^\\infty c_n cos(nx), then multiplying both sides by (sqrt(5) - 2cosx):\n\n1 = sum_{n=0}^\\infty c_n cos(nx) (sqrt(5) - 2cosx).\n\nExpanding the right-hand side:\n\nsqrt(5) sum_{n=0}^\\infty c_n cos(nx) - 2 sum_{n=0}^\\infty c_n cos(nx) cosx.\n\nUsing the product-to-sum identity: cos(nx)cosx = [cos((n+1)x) + cos((n-1)x)]/2.\n\nThus, the equation becomes:\n\n1 = sqrt(5) sum_{n=0}^\\infty c_n cos(nx) - sum_{n=0}^\\infty c_n [cos((n+1)x) + cos((n-1)x)].\n\nRearranging terms:\n\n1 = sqrt(5) c_0/2 + sqrt(5) sum_{n=1}^\\infty c_n cos(nx) - sum_{n=0}^\\infty c_n [cos((n+1)x) + cos((n-1)x)].\n\nBut this seems complicated to equate coefficients. Let's equate coefficients for each cos(kx):\n\nFor k=0: 1 = sqrt(5) c_0 - c_0 (since the sum over n=0 of [cos((n+1)x) + cos((n-1)x)] when k=0 would involve cos(-1x) which is cosx, but n starts at 0. Wait, this is getting too messy. Maybe a better approach is to use generating functions or recognize the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the integral is from 0 to π and involves x². Maybe expanding x² as a Fourier series itself. But x² is a polynomial, and its Fourier series over [0, π] can be expressed as a sum of cos(nx) terms. Let me recall that.\n\nThe Fourier series of x² on [0, π] can be written as a_0/2 + sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n cos(nx), where a_n = (2/π) ∫0^π x² cos(nx) dx. But we already computed that a_n = (2π (-1)^n)/n² for n ≥1, and a_0 = (2/π)(π³/3) = 2π²/3.\n\nTherefore, x² = π²/3 + 2 sum_{n=1}^\\infty [ (-1)^n π /n² cos(nx) ].\n\nThen, multiply both sides by 1/(sqrt(5) - 2cosx) and integrate from 0 to π:\n\nIntegral I = ∫0^π x²/(sqrt(5) - 2cosx) dx = ∫0^π [π²/3 + 2 sum_{n=1}^\\infty [ (-1)^n π /n² cos(nx) ] ] / (sqrt(5) - 2cosx) dx.\n\nThis can be split into two integrals:\n\nI = π²/3 ∫0^π dx/(sqrt(5) - 2cosx) + 2π sum_{n=1}^\\infty [ (-1)^n /n² ∫0^π cos(nx)/(sqrt(5) - 2cosx) dx ].\n\nWe already know that ∫0^π dx/(sqrt(5) - 2cosx) = π. So the first term is π²/3 * π = π³/3.\n\nFor the second term, we need to compute J_n = ∫0^π cos(nx)/(sqrt(5) - 2cosx) dx for each n ≥1.\n\nLet me compute J_n. Let's use the same Fourier series approach for 1/(sqrt(5) - 2cosx) = sum_{m=0}^\\infty c_m cos(mx). Then,\n\nJ_n = ∫0^π cos(nx) sum_{m=0}^\\infty c_m cos(mx) dx = sum_{m=0}^\\infty c_m ∫0^π cos(nx) cos(mx) dx.\n\nUsing orthogonality, ∫0^π cos(nx) cos(mx) dx = 0 if m ≠n, and π/2 if m=n ≠0, and π if m=n=0. Therefore,\n\nJ_n = sum_{m=0}^\\infty c_m * (π/2) δ_{m,n} = (π/2) c_n.\n\nTherefore, J_n = (π/2) c_n.\n\nBut we need to find c_n, the Fourier coefficients of 1/(sqrt(5) - 2cosx). Earlier attempts were incorrect, so let's find them correctly.\n\nLet me denote f(x) = 1/(sqrt(5) - 2cosx) = sum_{m=0}^\\infty c_m cos(mx). To find c_m, multiply both sides by cos(kx) and integrate from 0 to π:\n\n∫0^π f(x) cos(kx) dx = sum_{m=0}^\\infty c_m ∫0^π cos(mx) cos(kx) dx = c_k * π/2 for k ≥1, and c_0 * π/2 for k=0.\n\nTherefore, c_k = (2/π) ∫0^π f(x) cos(kx) dx for k ≥0.\n\nBut we already know that for k=0, c_0 = (2/π) ∫0^π dx/(sqrt(5) - 2cosx) = (2/π)* π = 2.\n\nFor k ≥1, c_k = (2/π) ∫0^π cos(kx)/(sqrt(5) - 2cosx) dx = (2/π) J_k.\n\nBut this seems like a circular argument. However, from our previous attempt with generating functions, we suspect that c_k = 2*( (sqrt(5)-1)/2 )^k. Let's verify for k=0, c_0=2, which matches.\n\nFor k=1, c_1 = 2*( (sqrt(5)-1)/2 ) = sqrt(5) -1.\n\nWait, let's check this. If c_k = 2*( (sqrt(5)-1)/2 )^k, then for k=1, c_1 = 2*( (sqrt(5)-1)/2 ) = sqrt(5)-1 ≈ 2.236 -1 =1.236. But then, J_1 = (π/2) c_1 ≈ (π/2)*1.236 ≈ 1.94. But does this match the integral?\n\nAlternatively, use a generating function approach. Let me consider the integral J_k = ∫0^π cos(kx)/(sqrt(5) - 2cosx) dx.\n\nLet me write this as Re[ ∫0^π e^{ikx}/(sqrt(5) - 2cosx) dx ]. \n\nLet me substitute z = e^{ix}, so x ranges from 0 to π, so z ranges from 1 to -1 along the upper half of the unit circle. Then, cosx = (z + z^{-1})/2, dx = dz/(iz). The integral becomes:\n\nRe[ ∫_{z=1}^{-1} z^k / (sqrt(5) - (z + z^{-1})) * dz/(iz) ].\n\nSimplify the denominator: sqrt(5) - (z + z^{-1}) = - z^{-1} ( z^2 - sqrt(5) z +1 ). \n\nThus, the integral becomes:\n\nRe[ -i ∫_{1}^{-1} z^{k -1} / ( z^2 - sqrt(5) z +1 ) dz ].\n\nFactor the denominator: z^2 - sqrt(5) z +1. The roots are z = [sqrt(5) ± 1]/2. Let's compute them:\n\nz_+ = [sqrt(5) +1]/2 ≈ (2.236 +1)/2 ≈ 1.618 (which is φ), z_- = [sqrt(5) -1]/2 ≈ 0.618 (which is 1/φ).\n\nThus, the denominator factors as (z - φ)(z - 1/φ). Therefore, the integrand becomes -i z^{k -1}/[(z - φ)(z -1/φ)].\n\nWe can perform partial fractions decomposition:\n\n1/[(z - φ)(z -1/φ)] = A/(z - φ) + B/(z -1/φ).\n\nSolving for A and B:\n\nA(z -1/φ) + B(z - φ) =1. Setting z = φ: A(φ -1/φ) =1 → A =1/(φ -1/φ) = φ/(φ² -1). Since φ² = φ +1, φ² -1 = φ. Therefore, A = φ/(φ) =1.\n\nSimilarly, setting z =1/φ: B(1/φ - φ) =1 → B =1/(1/φ - φ) = -φ/(φ² -1) = -1.\n\nThus, the integrand becomes -i [1/(z - φ) -1/(z -1/φ)] z^{k-1}.\n\nTherefore, the integral is -i ∫_{1}^{-1} [z^{k-1}/(z - φ) - z^{k-1}/(z -1/φ) ] dz.\n\nNow, we can integrate term by term. For the first term, ∫ z^{k-1}/(z - φ) dz. The contour is from z=1 to z=-1 along the upper half unit circle. However, the integrand has a pole at z=φ, which lies outside the unit circle since φ ≈1.618 >1. Similarly, the pole at z=1/φ ≈0.618 is inside the unit circle.\n\nTherefore, the first integral has no poles inside the contour, so the integral over the closed contour would be zero. But since we are integrating from 1 to -1 along the upper semicircle, and the path is not closed, we need to consider residues. However, since φ is outside the unit circle, the integral ∫_{1}^{-1} z^{k-1}/(z - φ) dz is part of the contour that does not enclose the pole at φ. Therefore, this integral is not affected by residues. Similarly, the second term has a pole at z=1/φ, which is inside the unit circle.\n\nTo evaluate the integral, let's close the contour. The original integral is from z=1 to z=-1 along the upper semicircle. To apply the residue theorem, we can close the contour by going from z=-1 back to z=1 along the lower semicircle, but since the integrand is not analytic, this might complicate things. Alternatively, consider that for the integral from 1 to -1, we can parameterize z = e^{iθ} with θ from 0 to π, but I'm not sure.\n\nA",
