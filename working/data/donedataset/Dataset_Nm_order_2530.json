    "AcceptedAnswer": "Your definition of limsup is not correct: $$\\limsup_n A_n(\\epsilon)=\\bigcap_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\bigcup_{i=n}^{\\infty}A_i(\\epsilon).$$ By definition of limit, $\\omega\\in\\{\\lim_n X_n=X\\}$ if and only if for all $m\\geq1$ there exists $n\\geq1$ such that for every $i\\geq n$ it holds $|X_i(\\omega)-X(\\omega)|\\leq 1/m$ if and only if $$\\omega\\in \\bigcap_{m=1}^{\\infty}\\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\bigcap_{i=n}^{\\infty} (A_i(1/m))^c=\\left(\\bigcup_{m=1}^{\\infty}\\limsup_nA_n(1/m)\\right)^c.$$ Then $$P(\\lim_n X_n=X)=1-P\\left(\\bigcup_{m=1}^{\\infty}\\limsup_nA_n(1/m)\\right)\\geq 1-\\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty}P(\\limsup_nA_n(1/m))=1.$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about proving that the Borel-Cantelli lemma implies almost sure convergence. The user is stuck on connecting the limsup of events A_n(ε) having probability zero to the almost sure convergence of X_n to X.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The problem mentions the Borel-Cantelli lemma, so one assumption is that the lemma applies. The Borel-Cantelli lemma usually states that if the sum of probabilities of events A_n is finite, then the probability that infinitely many A_n occur is zero. So maybe the assumption here is that the sum of P(A_n(ε)) converges for every ε>0. \n\nNext, the events A_n(ε) are defined in terms of the convergence of X_n to X. Typically, A_n(ε) could be the event where |X_n - X| ≥ ε. So another assumption would be that A_n(ε) is defined as {|X_n - X| ≥ ε} for each ε > 0.\n\nThe problem statement also mentions showing that P(limsup A_n(ε)) = 0 implies P(lim X_n = X) = 1. So the goal is to connect these two statements. The key here is understanding that limsup A_n(ε) being a probability zero event means that with probability 1, only finitely many A_n(ε) occur. Which, by the definition of convergence, would mean that X_n converges to X almost surely because for every ε > 0, |X_n - X| < ε eventually.\n\nSo putting this all together, the assumptions should include the definition of A_n(ε), the application of Borel-Cantelli (sum of probabilities is finite), and perhaps that the events A_n(ε) are defined in terms of the convergence. The problem then is to show that under these conditions, the probability that X_n converges to X is 1.\n\nWait, but in the example provided, the original problem had an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Hmm, that seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example is a different case. Let me check again.\n\nThe example original problem was: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so maybe the formatted problem was incorrect? Or perhaps the example was a mistake. Hmm, maybe the user is expecting to filter out the assumptions that are implicitly given in the problem. So in the example, maybe the original problem had a hidden assumption that n is divisible by 7, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps the example was structured to list all assumptions, including the domain of n (integers) and any additional conditions. But the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should just be that n is an integer. The formatted example incorrectly added \"n is divisible by 7\". Maybe that was an error in the example.\n\nBut regardless, the user's instruction is to list all the assumptions in the problem. For the current problem, the Borel-Cantelli implies almost sure convergence. The key assumptions here would be:\n\n1. The probability space is defined (but since it's standard, maybe not needed).\n2. For every ε > 0, the events A_n(ε) are defined as {|X_n - X| ≥ ε}.\n3. The sum of P(A_n(ε)) converges for every ε > 0 (so that Borel-Cantelli applies).\n4. The goal is to show P(lim X_n = X) = 1 given that P(limsup A_n(ε)) = 0 for every ε > 0.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user is asking to show that P(limsup A_n(ε)) = 0 implies P(lim X_n = X) = 1. So the assumptions would be that for each ε > 0, the event limsup A_n(ε) has probability zero. And the problem is to conclude almost sure convergence.\n\nAlternatively, if we are applying Borel-Cantelli, then the assumption would be that sum P(A_n(ε)) < ∞ for every ε > 0, which by Borel-Cantelli implies P(limsup A_n(ε)) = 0. Then from that, conclude almost sure convergence.\n\nSo the problem as stated by the user is that given P(limsup A_n(ε)) = 0, prove that P(lim X_n = X) = 1. Therefore, the assumptions here would be that for each ε > 0, A_n(ε) is defined as |X_n - X| ≥ ε, and that P(limsup A_n(ε)) = 0 for every ε > 0. The problem is to show that this implies almost sure convergence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Borel-Cantelli lemma is part of the assumptions? The title says \"Borel Cantelli Lemma Implies Almost Sure Convergence\", so perhaps the problem is to prove that under the condition that sum P(|X_n - X| ≥ ε) converges for every ε > 0, then X_n converges to X almost surely. But the user is specifically asking about the step where P(limsup A_n(ε)) = 0 implies P(lim X_n = X) =1.\n\nIn the problem statement, the user is starting from the fact that Borel-Cantelli gives P(limsup A_n(ε)) =0, and wants to connect that to almost sure convergence. Therefore, the key assumptions here are the definition of A_n(ε) as the event that |X_n - X| ≥ ε, and that for every ε > 0, P(limsup A_n(ε)) = 0. Then the problem is to show that this implies P(lim X_n = X) = 1.\n\nSo to structure this according to the format:\n\nAssumptions:\n- For every ε > 0, A_n(ε) is the event that |X_n - X| ≥ ε.\n- For every ε > 0, the probability of limsup A_n(ε) is 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the probability that X_n converges to X is 1.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be more precisely stated as proving that if for every ε > 0, P(limsup A_n(ε)) = 0, then P(lim X_n = X) = 1. But the user's original problem title is \"Borel Cantelli Lemma Implies Almost Sure Convergence\", so the broader context is using Borel-Cantelli to show almost sure convergence, which usually involves the condition that the sum of probabilities of |X_n - X| ≥ ε is finite for every ε, leading to P(limsup A_n(ε)) =0, hence almost sure convergence.\n\nBut the specific step the user is stuck on is from P(limsup A_n(ε)) =0 to P(lim X_n = X) =1. So in that specific step, the assumptions would be the definitions of A_n(ε) and the limsup events having probability zero.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nFor every ε > 0, A_n(ε) is defined as { |X_n - X| ≥ ε },\nFor every ε > 0, the probability of limsup A_n(ε) is 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the probability that lim X_n = X is 1.\n\nI think that's the correct way to structure it. Each assumption is one condition applied to one object (A_n(ε) and their limsup probability). Then the problem is to prove the convergence in probability 1.",
