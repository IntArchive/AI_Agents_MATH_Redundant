    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about proving that if \\( a^n + n \\) divides \\( b^n + n \\) for all natural numbers \\( n \\), then \\( a = b \\). \n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions. The user mentioned that each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. Let's break down the problem:\n\n1. The variables \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are natural numbers. That's one assumption about their domain.\n2. The condition given is that for all natural numbers \\( n \\), \\( a^n + n \\) divides \\( b^n + n \\). Since this is a universal statement applying to all \\( n \\), it's a single condition involving both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\nWait, the example given in the prompt had two assumptions even though the original problem didn't explicitly state both. The example included that \\( n \\) is an integer and that \\( n \\) is divisible by 7. But in the original problem here, the divisibility condition is for all \\( n \\), so maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are natural numbers.\n- For every natural number \\( n \\), \\( a^n + n \\) divides \\( b^n + n \\).\n\nBut according to the format, each assumption should be a single line addressing one property or condition for one object. So maybe split them:\n\nAssumption:\n- \\( a \\) is a natural number.\n- \\( b \\) is a natural number.\n- For all \\( n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\), \\( a^n + n \\) divides \\( b^n + n \\).\n\nBut wait, the original problem states \"Let \\( a, b \\in \\mathbb{N} \\), such that...\". So the first two assumptions are about \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) being in \\( \\mathbb{N} \\), and the third is the divisibility condition. However, the example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. But in the example, the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7; perhaps the user made an error? Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem had assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the user intended to have specific conditions. But in reality, the original example problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should be that n is an integer. But the formatted problem in the example added \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original problem. That suggests maybe the example was incorrect. Wait, perhaps the original example had a different problem? Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem says: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions are \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so n is any integer, not necessarily divisible by 7. The formatted problem's assumption added \"n is divisible by 7\", which changes the problem. That might be a mistake in the example. So perhaps the user intended that sometimes assumptions need to be split even if they are part of the problem statement. But in this case, for the problem at hand, the user's example might have been incorrectly structured. Therefore, perhaps for the current problem, the assumptions should be as per the problem statement without adding extra conditions.\n\nSo, the original problem states: Let a, b be natural numbers such that for all n in N, a^n + n divides b^n +n. Prove that a = b.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- a is a natural number.\n- b is a natural number.\n- For all natural numbers n, a^n + n divides b^n + n.\n\nBut according to the format, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So splitting into:\n\nAssumption:\n- a is a natural number.\n- b is a natural number.\n- For every natural number n, a^n + n divides b^n + n.\n\nBut maybe \"for every natural number n\" is part of the condition, so the third assumption is the divisibility condition applying to all n. Since the problem says \"for all n\", that's a single condition. So the three assumptions are:\n\n1. a is in N.\n2. b is in N.\n3. For all n in N, (a^n +n) divides (b^n +n).\n\nBut in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", and the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", which seems contradictory. Perhaps the example was incorrect. Therefore, in our current problem, we need to follow the problem's actual statement. The problem says a and b are natural numbers, and the divisibility holds for all natural numbers n. So the assumptions are as above.\n\nBut wait, the problem states \"for all n ∈ N\", so that's a single condition. So the formatted problem's assumptions should list:\n\nAssumption:\n- a is a natural number,\n- b is a natural number,\n- For every natural number n, a^n + n divides b^n + n.\n\nProblem: Prove that a = b.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So each assumption is a separate line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. The third assumption is about the divisibility condition applied to all n, which involves both a and b but is a single condition.",
