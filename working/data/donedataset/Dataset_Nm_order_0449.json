    "Content": "It's a simple exercise to show that two similar matrices has the same eigenvalues and eigenvectors (my favorite way is noting that they represent the same linear transformation in different bases). However, to show that two matrices has the same characteristic polynomial it does not suffice to show that they have the same eigenvalues and eigenvectors - one needs to say something smart about the algebraic multiplicities of the eigenvalues. Moreover, we might be working over a field which is not algebraically closed and hence simply \"don't have\" all the eigenvalues. This can be overcome, of course, by working in the algebraic closure of the field, but it complicates the explanation. I'm looking for a proof that is simple and stand-alone as much as possible (the goal is writing an expository article about the subject, so clarity is the most important thing, not efficiency).",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If you define the characteristic polynomial of a matrix $A$ to be $\\det(xI - A)$, then for $M$ invertible we have: $\\det(xI - M^{-1} A M)$ $= \\det(M^{-1} xI M - M^{-1} A M)$ $= \\det(M^{-1} (xI-A) M)$ $= \\det (M^{-1}) \\det(xI-A) \\det(M)$ $=\\det(xI - A)$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe original question is about proving that similar matrices have the same characteristic polynomial. The user mentioned that existing proofs might involve eigenvalues and eigenvectors, but that approach has complications, especially over non-algebraically closed fields. They want a simple, standalone proof.\n\nNow, looking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. For the example given, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. \n\nIn the current problem, the key points are that two matrices are similar. Similar matrices, by definition, mean there exists an invertible matrix P such that B = P^{-1}AP. The problem is to prove they have the same characteristic polynomial. \n\nSo the assumptions here would be:\n\n1. A and B are similar matrices.\n2. There exists an invertible matrix P such that B = P^{-1}AP.\n\nBut wait, those are essentially the same assumption. Since similar matrices are defined by the existence of such a P. So maybe just one assumption: A and B are similar matrices. However, the example had two separate assumptions even if they relate to the same object. Wait, in the example, the first assumption was \"n is an integer\" and the second was \"n is divisible by 7\". Both apply to n. So in this case, the main assumption is that A and B are similar. But perhaps there's another implicit assumption, like working over a field where determinants are defined? But the problem doesn't specify any restrictions on the field. The user's concern was about fields not algebraically closed, but the problem statement itself doesn't add conditions. The question is more about the proof technique that avoids relying on algebraic closures.\n\nBut according to the formatting instructions, the assumptions are those given in the problem. Since the problem is to prove that similar matrices have the same characteristic polynomial, the only assumption is that A and B are similar. The existence of P is part of the definition of similarity.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions section should list:\n\nAssumption: A and B are similar matrices.\n\nProblem: Prove that similar matrices have the same characteristic polynomial.\n\nWait, but the original question title is \"Elegant proofs that similar matrices have the same characteristic polynomial?\" and the problem is asking for a proof. The user is looking for a clear, standalone proof, perhaps not relying on eigenvalues or algebraic closures.\n\nSo, the formatted problem should have the assumption that A and B are similar matrices, and the problem is to prove they have the same characteristic polynomial. There are no other explicit assumptions given in the original question. The user is pointing out that existing proofs might have complications, but the problem itself doesn't add extra conditions. Therefore, the formatted problem should be as simple as that.",
