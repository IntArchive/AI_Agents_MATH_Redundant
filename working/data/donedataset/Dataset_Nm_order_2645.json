    "Content": "The problem is following.\nLet $f:(-1,1)\\to [-1,1]$ has $n$ derivatives. Prove that there exists a number $\\alpha_n$ (independent from $f$) such that condition $|f'(0)|\\geq \\alpha_n$ implies that equation $f^{(n)}(t)=0$ has at least $n-1$ distinct zeroes on $(-1,1).$ I can prove this for $n=2.$ In this case it is enough to take $\\alpha_2>2.$ Unfortunatley, I can't proceed further and prove the general case.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "By Darboux's theorem $f^{(n)}$, being a derivative, has the intermediate value property, so it suffices to show that $f^{(n)}$ has $n$ values with alternating signs. This we can prove by induction. I will first prove a lemma so as not to interrupt the flow of the proof later: For every non-negative integer $n$ and every length $L$, there is $\\beta_n(L)$ such that if $f:(-1,1)\\to[-1,1]$ has $n$ derivatives, then there is no interval of length $L$ over which $|f^{(n)}|\\gt \\beta_n(L)$. The proof proceeds by induction. For the base case $n=0$, we can choose $b_0(L)=1$ since $|f|\\le 1$. Now assume for the sake of contradiction that there is an interval of length $L$ over which $|f^{(n+1)}|\\gt \\beta_{n+1}(L)$, with $\\beta_{n+1}(L)$ to be determined. Then by Darboux's theorem $f^{(n+1)}$ doesn't change sign on the interval, and by the mean value theorem in each quarter of the interval $f^{(n)}$ must change by at least $\\beta_{n+1}(L)/(L/4)$ in the same direction. It can vanish in at most one of these quarters, and if so there is at least one other quarter which is not adjacent to that quarter; thus there is a quarter in which $|f^{(n)}|\\gt \\beta_{n+1}(L)/(L/4)$, and we obtain a contradiction by choosing $\\beta_{n+1}(L)=(L/4)\\beta_n(L/4)$. We can use this to prove a strengthening of the claim: For every $\\epsilon,M\\gt0$ there is $\\alpha_n(\\epsilon,M)$ such that if $f:(-1,1)\\to[-1,1]$ has $n$ derivatives and $|f'(0)|\\ge\\alpha_n(\\epsilon,M)$, then $f^{(n)}$ has $n$ values with alternating signs in $[-\\epsilon,\\epsilon]$ and the outermost of these values have absolute value $\\ge M$. The base case $n=1$ is again trivial: Choose $\\alpha_1(\\epsilon,M)=M$; then $f'(0)$ is the required value. Now assume that $f^{(n)}$ has $n$ values in $[-\\epsilon,\\epsilon]$ with alternating signs and outermost absolute values $\\ge M$ if $|f'(0)|\\ge\\alpha_n(\\epsilon,M)$. By the mean value theorem, that implies that $f^{(n+1)}$ has $n-1$ values with alternating signs in between, so we only have to find two more such values, one on each side. Let $\\epsilon,M\\gt0$ be given. If $|f'(0)|\\ge\\alpha_{n}(\\epsilon/2,\\kappa)$ with $\\kappa$ to be determined, then $f^{(n)}$ has $n$ values in $[-\\epsilon/2,\\epsilon/2]$ with alternating signs and outermost absolute values $\\ge\\kappa$. Let the rightmost of these values be at $a$. By the lemma, there is $\\xi\\in[a,a+\\epsilon/2]$ with $|f^{(n)}(\\xi)|\\le\\beta_n(\\epsilon/2)$, and then by the mean value theorem there is $\\zeta\\in[a,\\xi]$ with $$|f^{(n+1)}(\\zeta)|=|f^{(n)}(\\xi)-f^{(n)}(a)|/(\\xi-a)\\ge\\left(\\kappa-\\beta_n(\\epsilon/2)\\right)/(\\epsilon/2)\\;,$$ and the sign of $f^{(n+1)}(\\zeta)$ is the one required for the alternation. A leftmost value is found similarly. Thus, if we choose $\\kappa$ such that $\\left(\\kappa-\\beta_n(\\epsilon/2)\\right)/(\\epsilon/2)=M$, i.e. $\\kappa=M\\epsilon/2+\\beta_n(\\epsilon/2)$, then $\\alpha_{n+1}(\\epsilon,M)=\\alpha_n(\\epsilon/2,\\kappa)$ suffices.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about proving that for a function f with certain properties, there exists a constant α_n such that if the derivative at 0 is at least α_n, then the n-th derivative has at least n-1 distinct zeros. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The problem states that f is a function from (-1,1) to [-1,1], and it has n derivatives. So the domain is (-1,1), the codomain is [-1,1], and f is n-times differentiable. Then, the main condition is that |f'(0)| ≥ α_n, which should lead to the conclusion that f^{(n)}(t) = 0 has at least n-1 distinct zeros. The task is to prove this existence of α_n independent of f.\n\nLooking at the example provided, each assumption is a single property applied to one object. So breaking down the problem:\n\n1. The function f maps (-1,1) to [-1,1]. That's the domain and codomain.\n2. f has n derivatives, meaning it's n-times differentiable on (-1,1).\n3. The problem is to find α_n (independent of f) such that if |f'(0)| ≥ α_n, then f^{(n)}(t) = 0 has at least n-1 distinct zeros in (-1,1).\n\nWait, the example included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the original problem. In this case, there's no such condition on n, except that it's given as part of the problem statement. The problem is for a general n, so the assumptions would be about f, not about n. So the key assumptions are the domain, codomain, differentiability, and the condition on f'(0). \n\nSo the assumptions should be:\n\n- f: (-1,1) → [-1,1].\n- f is n-times differentiable on (-1,1).\n- |f'(0)| ≥ α_n (but this is part of the condition that leads to the conclusion, so maybe not an assumption but part of the problem statement? Wait, in the example, the assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". The original problem there was to prove for every integer n divisible by 7. Here, the problem is for any function f satisfying the domain, codomain, and differentiability, there exists α_n such that if |f'(0)| ≥ α_n, then the conclusion holds. So the assumptions are about f's properties, and α_n is part of the problem's condition.\n\nSo the Problem part would be: Prove that there exists α_n (independent of f) such that if |f'(0)| ≥ α_n, then f^{(n)}(t)=0 has at least n-1 distinct zeros in (-1,1).\n\nTherefore, structuring:\n\nAssumption:\n- f is a function from (-1,1) to [-1,1],\n- f has n derivatives on (-1,1).\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a number α_n (independent of f) such that if |f'(0)| ≥ α_n, then the equation f^{(n)}(t) = 0 has at least n-1 distinct zeros on (-1,1).\n\nWait, but in the original question, the user says \"the problem is following\" and then states the problem. So I need to ensure that all the assumptions are captured. The problem says \"Let f:(-1,1)→[-1,1] has n derivatives. Prove that there exists α_n...\". So the assumptions are indeed the domain, codomain, and differentiability. The conclusion is about the existence of α_n with the implication.\n\nSo the formatted problem should list the assumptions as the properties of f, and the problem is to prove the existence of α_n with the specified condition leading to the zeros of the n-th derivative.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me check the example again. The example's assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions are about f's domain, codomain, and differentiability. The problem is the rest of the statement. So yes, that should be the structure.",
