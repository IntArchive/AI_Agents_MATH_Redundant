    "Content": "I was playing around with sums the other day, and started fiddling with the function\n$$\nf(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\sin(n^2 x)}{n}\\, .\n$$\nNow, obviously this is a very jagged function. (I think the derivative doesn't exist anywhere.) However, it seems to go to a finite, positive limit as $x\\rightarrow 0_+$. Furthermore, just looking at the first few decimal places of this limit, it looks like it may be $\\pi/4$. It seems plausible that such a limit might go to a \"nice\" number like $\\pi/4$, but I can't prove it. A few known things about this problem: 1) $f(x)$ is odd, so $\\lim_{x\\rightarrow 0_{-}} f(x) = -\\lim_{x\\rightarrow 0_{+}} f(x)$. 2) $f(x)$ is $2\\pi$-periodic (obviously). 3) One possible way that occurs to me to evaluate this limit (if it exists), is to replace it with the following:\n\\begin{align}\n\\lim_{x\\rightarrow 0_{+}} f(x)\n&= \\lim_{x\\rightarrow 0_{+}} \\frac{1}{x}\\int_{0}^{x} dy\\, f(y)\\\\\n&= \\lim_{x\\rightarrow 0_{+}} \\frac{2}{x}\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\sin^2\\left(n^2 x/2\\right)}{n^3}\n\\end{align}\nThe latter series is smoother and converges more quickly than the original one, so it's better-suited to numerics. If I use $x = 0.0001$ in this series and sum the first $100,000$ terms in Mathematica, I get $0.785393$, whereas $\\pi/4 = 0.785398...$ I don't know where to go from there. (I tried the Poisson summation formula to no avail.) Can anyone here prove this conjecture? Or disprove it? Or show that the question is somehow ill-posed?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The example provided shows how assumptions and the problem should be listed. \n\nFirst, I need to read through the original question carefully. The title is \"Conjecture: $\\lim_{x\\rightarrow 0_+} \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\sin(n^2 x)}{n} = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$\". The user is asking about the limit of this sum as x approaches 0 from the positive side. They mention that f(x) is the sum of sin(n²x)/n from n=1 to infinity. They also state some properties: f(x) is odd, 2π-periodic, and they tried converting the limit into an integral involving f(y) and then into another series. Their numerical calculation with x=0.0001 and summing 100,000 terms gives approximately 0.785393, which is close to π/4 ≈ 0.785398. They want to know if the conjecture is true, or if the problem is ill-posed.\n\nNow, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem statement includes a few known things: \n\n1. f(x) is odd.\n2. f(x) is 2π-periodic.\n3. They tried transforming the limit into an integral and another series.\n4. The numerical result is close to π/4.\n\nBut the example format's assumptions are more about the conditions given in the problem. In the example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So here, the problem is about the limit as x approaches 0+ of this series. The assumptions would be the properties of f(x) that are given, which are necessary for the problem.\n\nLooking at the problem statement, the user defines f(x) as the sum from n=1 to infinity of sin(n²x)/n. Then mentions that f(x) is odd (so f(-x) = -f(x)), and 2π-periodic. Those are key properties. Also, the problem is about the limit as x approaches 0 from the right. The user also transforms the limit into an integral and another series, but that seems like their approach to solving it, not an assumption. The numerical result is evidence but not an assumption.\n\nSo the assumptions should be:\n\n- f(x) is defined as the sum from n=1 to ∞ of sin(n²x)/n.\n\n- f(x) is odd (so the left-hand limit would be -π/4 if the right-hand is π/4).\n\n- f(x) is 2π-periodic.\n\nBut wait, the problem is about the limit as x approaches 0 from the positive side. The original problem is to prove or disprove that this limit is π/4. So the assumptions are the properties of f(x) given, which are part of the problem statement. Therefore, the assumptions would include:\n\n1. f(x) = ∑_{n=1}^∞ sin(n²x)/n.\n\n2. f(x) is an odd function.\n\n3. f(x) is 2π-periodic.\n\nHowever, in the example, the assumptions included conditions on the variables (n is integer, n divisible by 7). In this case, the problem is about the limit of the function defined by the series. The function's properties (odd, 2π-periodic) are given, so they should be listed as assumptions. But the definition of f(x) as the series is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Wait, maybe in the example, the original problem didn't have the assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the formatted problem added it. Wait, no, looking back at the example:\n\nOriginal problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem's assumption is \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, but in the original problem, it's for every integer n, but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example was a mistake? Wait, perhaps the original problem might have had more context. Maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to show how to structure even if some assumptions are added. Hmm, this is confusing. But the user now wants to apply the same process to the new problem.\n\nWait, perhaps in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake, unless the original problem had a typo. But maybe in the example, the user intended to show that they can add assumptions. But maybe that's a wrong example. Anyway, regardless of the example's correctness, the current task is to structure the given problem into assumptions and problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the user is conjecturing that the limit as x approaches 0+ of the sum is π/4. The problem statement includes that f(x) is odd and 2π-periodic. Those are given properties, so they should be in assumptions. The definition of f(x) as the sum is part of the problem statement, so perhaps it's part of the problem, not an assumption. Wait, but in the example, the problem statement included the definition of A(n). So maybe the way to do it is: the problem is the conjecture, and the assumptions are the given properties. Let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal problem in example: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems contradictory. Unless there was a mistake in the example. Maybe the original problem had n divisible by 7, but the user mistyped. But regardless, following the user's example, they extracted the assumptions from the problem statement. So in the current case, the problem is to prove the conjecture that the limit is π/4. The assumptions would be the properties given in the problem: f(x) is odd, 2π-periodic, and defined as the sum. However, in the problem statement, the user also mentions that they transformed the limit into an integral and another series. But that's part of their approach, not part of the problem's assumptions. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- f(x) = ∑_{n=1}^∞ sin(n²x)/n.\n\n- f(x) is odd.\n\n- f(x) is 2π-periodic.\n\nBut since the problem is to find the limit as x approaches 0+, maybe there's an assumption that the limit exists? The user says \"it seems to go to a finite, positive limit as x→0+\", but they aren't sure. So maybe the problem is to determine whether the limit exists and equals π/4. So perhaps the problem includes the conjecture about the existence and value. Therefore, the assumptions would be the properties of f(x) as given, and the problem is to prove or disprove the conjecture.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) is defined as the sum from n=1 to infinity of sin(n²x)/n,\nf(x) is an odd function,\nf(x) is 2π-periodic.\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that $$\\lim_{x\\rightarrow 0_+} \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\sin(n^2 x)}{n} = \\frac{\\pi}{4}.$$\n\nWait, but the problem statement in the original question is \"Prove that the limit is π/4\", but the user also asks if the question is ill-posed. So the problem is to determine whether the conjecture holds. Therefore, the problem should be stated as proving or disproving the conjecture, or showing it's ill-posed. But according to the example, the problem is just the statement to prove. In the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem is to prove the same with added assumptions. Here, the problem is the conjecture. So perhaps the problem is as stated, the conjecture. So the formatted problem should be the conjecture itself. So yes, that's correct.",
