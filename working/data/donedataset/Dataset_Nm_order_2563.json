    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants to prove that the inverse Fourier transform of 1 is the Dirac delta function. From what I remember, the Fourier transform of the delta function δ(t) is indeed 1. But the inverse part is a bit trickier. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the definitions. The inverse Fourier transform integral is usually given by (1/(2π)) times the integral of F(ω) times e^{iωt} dω from -∞ to ∞. In this case, F(ω) is 1, so the integral becomes (1/(2π)) ∫_{-∞}^{∞} e^{iωt} dω. \n\nBut when you try to compute this integral directly, it doesn't converge in the traditional sense because e^{iωt} oscillates and doesn't decay as ω approaches infinity. That's probably why the user mentioned getting something that doesn't converge. \n\nHmm, so how do we handle this? I remember that distributions or generalized functions, like the Dirac delta, are used in such cases. The integral doesn't converge as a regular function but makes sense in the distributional sense. \n\nMaybe the key here is to consider the limit of a sequence of functions whose Fourier transforms approach 1. For example, taking a Gaussian function which tends to 1 as its width becomes large, but the inverse transform of a Gaussian is another Gaussian, and in the limit as the width becomes infinite, it should approach a delta function. \n\nAlternatively, another approach is to use the duality property of Fourier transforms. Since the Fourier transform of δ(t) is 1, then the inverse transform of 1 should be δ(t). But maybe the user is looking for a more direct proof. \n\nWait, perhaps using the integral definition and manipulating it in a way that introduces a convergence factor, like e^{-ε|ω|}, and then take the limit as ε approaches 0. That would make the integral converge, and in the limit, it should give the delta function. Let me check that idea. \n\nSo, if I consider ∫_{-∞}^{∞} e^{iωt} e^{-ε|ω|} dω. Splitting the integral into two parts from -∞ to 0 and 0 to ∞, the integral becomes ∫_{0}^{∞} e^{iωt - εω} dω + ∫_{-∞}^{0} e^{iωt + εω} dω. Computing each integral separately, they would evaluate to 1/(ε - it) + 1/(ε + it) which simplifies to 2ε/(ε² + t²). Then multiplying by 1/(2π), we get ε/(π(ε² + t²)). As ε approaches 0, this function becomes sharply peaked at t=0 and the integral over all t is 1, which is the definition of the delta function. \n\nSo, by introducing a convergence factor and taking the limit, we recover the delta function. This shows that the inverse Fourier transform of 1 is indeed δ(t). The user might have tried to compute the integral without considering this regularization, leading to a non-convergent result. Therefore, the key assumptions here involve the use of distributions and the limiting process.",
