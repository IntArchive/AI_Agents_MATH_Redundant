    "Content": "I'm looking for proofs of the following fact. Suppose that $R$ is a domain which is not a field with fraction field $K$. Then $K$ is not finitely generated as $R$-module. I know this fact is true, at least, when $R$ is Noetherian and I guess it is true in general. I know two proofs, one when $R$ is Noetherian and one (very indirect) when $R$ is Noetherian local. Do you know any direct proof for any arbitrary domain $R$? Thanks!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The fraction field $K$ has the structure of an $R$-module, and for any maximal ideal $\\mathfrak{m}$ of $R$, it also naturally has the structure of an $R_\\mathfrak{m}$-module. If $K$ is finitely generated as an $R$-module, then $K$ must also be finitely generated as an $R_\\mathfrak{m}$-module because $R_\\mathfrak{m}\\supseteq R$. Thus we are reduced to the case when $R$ is local. Let $R$ be a local domain with maximal ideal $\\mathfrak{m} \\neq 0$. Clearly, $\\mathfrak{m}K=K$. But the Jacobson radical of $R$ is just $\\mathfrak{m}$, so if $K$ is finitely generated as an $R$-module, then Nakayama's lemma implies that $K=0$, which is a contradiction.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants to prove that if R is a domain (not a field) with fraction field K, then K is not finitely generated as an R-module. They mentioned knowing proofs for the Noetherian case and a local Noetherian case, but are looking for a general proof for any domain R.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic concepts. A fraction field K of a domain R consists of elements a/b where a, b are in R and b ≠ 0. If K were finitely generated as an R-module, that would mean there exist elements k1, k2, ..., kn in K such that every element of K can be written as an R-linear combination of these ki's.\n\nSince R is not a field, there exists some nonzero element a in R that is not a unit. So, 1/a is in K. If K were finitely generated over R, then 1/a would be expressible as r1*k1 + ... + rn*kn for some ri in R. But I need to see why this leads to a contradiction.\n\nMaybe using the fact that if K is a finitely generated R-module, then R must be a field, which contradicts the assumption. Wait, how does that work? If R is a domain and K is a finitely generated R-module, then every element of K is integral over R. But K contains elements like 1/a where a is non-unit in R. If 1/a is integral over R, then there's a monic polynomial equation: (1/a)^n + c_{n-1}(1/a)^{n-1} + ... + c_0 = 0, where c_i are in R. Multiplying both sides by a^n gives 1 + c_{n-1}a + ... + c_0 a^n = 0, so 1 = -a(c_{n-1} + ... + c_0 a^{n-1}). But this would mean a is a unit in R, which contradicts the assumption that a is not a unit. Therefore, if K were finitely generated over R, then every element of K would be integral over R, but since there's an element 1/a which is not integral (as shown), this leads to a contradiction. Hence, K cannot be finitely generated as an R-module.\n\nWait, but does this require R to be Noetherian? The user mentioned that they know a proof when R is Noetherian. However, the argument I just thought of doesn't seem to require Noetherianness. It just uses the integrality condition. Let me check again.\n\nIf K is a finitely generated R-module, then every element of K is integral over R. This is a standard result in commutative algebra: if a module is finitely generated, then the elements are integral. The converse is also true, but here we need that finitely generated module implies integrality. That's true regardless of R being Noetherian. So this should work for any domain R. Therefore, the proof would be: Assume K is finitely generated over R. Then every element of K is integral over R. Take a non-unit a in R (since R is not a field). Then 1/a is in K, which would have to be integral over R. But as shown, this would imply a is a unit, contradiction. Hence, K cannot be finitely generated.\n\nTherefore, the key assumptions are:\n\n- R is a domain.\n- R is not a field.\n- K is the fraction field of R.\n\nThe problem is to show that K is not finitely generated as an R-module. So the structured problem would list these assumptions and state the problem accordingly.",
