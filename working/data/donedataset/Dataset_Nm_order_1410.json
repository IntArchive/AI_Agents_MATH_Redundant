    "Content": "I'm studying basic real analysis and stumbled across three big results (Fatou's lemma, Lebesgue's Dominated Convergence theorem, and the Monotone Convergence theorem) in the theory of Lebesgue integration. I've seen short and slick proofs of the LDCT and MCT from scratch (in Bogachev's Measure Theory and Bass' Graduate Real Analysis/Rudin's Real and Complex Analysis, respectively). However, I was wondering if such a proof exists for Fatou's lemma. I've seen a couple of proofs that rely on neither the MCT nor the LDCT (in particular, in Royden and Fitzpatrick's Real Analysis, and on the Wikipedia page for Fatou's lemma), and while these proofs aren't too tricky or difficult to understand, they seem considerably longer than the proofs of the other two theorems. So to summarize: Can someone supply me with a short and slick proof, perhaps even an outline of a proof for me to work through, of Fatou's lemma that does not rely on LDCT or MCT? Thank you!",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure a problem from Math Stack Exchange into their specified format. The example they gave involved taking an original problem, filtering out unrelated information, and listing assumptions line by line, each addressing a single property or condition applied to one object. Then, restating the problem concisely.\n\nLooking at the example, the original problem was about proving a number is divisible by 91. The formatted version listed assumptions about n being an integer and n being divisible by 7. But wait, in the original problem, the user mentioned \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted example, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Wait, no, maybe the original problem had a mistake or maybe the example is illustrative. Hmm, maybe in the example, the user wanted to highlight how to structure even if there's an added assumption. But I need to focus on the actual problem given here.\n\nThe current problem is from Math Stack Exchange titled \"A snappy proof of Fatou's lemma\". The user is asking for a short proof of Fatou's lemma that doesn't rely on the LDCT or MCT. The original question mentions that they've seen proofs in Royden, Fitzpatrick, and Wikipedia, but those are longer. They want a concise proof outline.\n\nNow, to structure this according to the required format. The assumptions would be the conditions under which Fatou's lemma holds. Fatou's lemma typically states that for a sequence of non-negative measurable functions, the integral of the liminf is less than or equal to the liminf of the integrals. So the assumptions would relate to the properties of the functions involved.\n\nLet me recall Fatou's lemma's exact statement. The standard assumptions are that the functions are measurable, non-negative, and defined on a measure space. So each function f_n is measurable, each f_n is non-negative, and they are defined on a measure space (which might be assumed to be a general measure space or specifically the Lebesgue measure as per the question's context). The problem is to prove Fatou's lemma under these assumptions without using MCT or LDCT.\n\nSo, breaking down the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. The objects here are the functions f_n. So each assumption would be about each f_n being measurable, each f_n being non-negative, and perhaps the measure space being of a certain type, though the problem might not specify, so maybe just the standard conditions.\n\nBut the original question doesn't restate the lemma; it assumes the reader knows Fatou's lemma. So to format this correctly, I need to extract the implicit assumptions from the context of proving Fatou's lemma. The problem is to supply a proof, so the assumptions are those required by the lemma itself.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n- For each $n$, $f_n$ is a measurable function.\n- For each $n$, $f_n$ is non-negative.\n\nPossibly also the measure space is a general measure space, but since the problem is in the context of Lebesgue integration, maybe the measure is Lebesgue measure on the real line. However, Fatou's lemma is usually stated for a general measure space. But the problem might not specify, so perhaps the assumptions are just the two above.\n\nThe problem statement would then be: Prove Fatou's lemma, i.e., that the integral of the liminf of f_n is less than or equal to the liminf of the integrals of f_n, without using the Monotone Convergence Theorem or the Lebesgue Dominated Convergence Theorem.\n\nBut I need to check if the original question mentions any specific conditions. The user wrote: \"studying basic real analysis... in the theory of Lebesgue integration.\" So the measure space is probably the Lebesgue measure on the real line, but Fatou's lemma is general. However, the problem might not require specifying the measure space, just the functions' properties.\n\nSo putting it all together, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. For each $n$, $f_n$ is a Lebesgue measurable function.\n2. For each $n$, $f_n$ is non-negative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe just measurable without specifying Lebesgue, but since the context is Lebesgue integration, perhaps specifying that.\n\nThe problem is to prove Fatou's lemma under these assumptions without using MCT or LDCT.\n\nSo the formatted problem would list each assumption line by line, then state the problem as proving Fatou's lemma.",
