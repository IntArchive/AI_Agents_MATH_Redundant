    "Content": "( Edit: Thank you Vladimir for providing the references for the closed form value of the integrals. My revised question is then to how to derive this closed form.) For all $n\\in\\mathbb{N}^+$, define $\\mathcal{I}_n$ by the definite integral,\n  $$\\mathcal{I}_n:=\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\sin^n{(x)}}{x^n}\\mathrm{d}x.$$\n  Prove that $\\mathcal{I}_n$ has the following closed form:\n  $$\\mathcal{I}_n\\stackrel{?}=\\pi\\,2^{-n}\\left(n\\sum_{k=0}^{\\lfloor\\frac{n-1}{2}\\rfloor}\\frac{(-2)^k(n-2k)^{n-1}}{k!(n-k)!}\\right),~~\\forall n\\in\\mathbb{N}^+.$$ Integrals of small positive integer powers of the $\\operatorname{sinc}$ function come up on a regular basis here, but it occurred to me that while I probably know the derivations for the $1\\le n\\le 4$ cases like the back of my hand, I can't recall ever working the integrals wfor any value of $n$ higher than that. The values of the first four integrals are, $$\\mathcal{I}_1=\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\\\\n\\mathcal{I}_2=\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\\\\n\\mathcal{I}_3=\\frac{3\\pi}{8},\\\\\n\\mathcal{I}_4=\\frac{\\pi}{3}.$$ So I set out to first calculate $\\mathcal{I}_5$ to see if any obvious pattern jumped out (and see if the trend of being equal to rational multiples of $\\pi$ continued). I wound up getting frustrated and asking WolframAlpha instead. It turns that while the first four cases hinted very much at the possibility of a simple pattern relating the values of $\\mathcal{I}_n$ for different positive integers $n$ (or possibly two separate patterns for even and odd $n$), the next few values most definitely did not: $$\\mathcal{I}_5=\\frac{115\\pi}{384},\\\\\n\\mathcal{I}_6=\\frac{11\\pi}{40},\\\\\n\\mathcal{I}_7=\\frac{5887\\pi}{23040}\\\\\n\\mathcal{I}_8=\\frac{151\\pi}{630}.$$ So my questions are, 1) is there a systematic way to compute these integrals for all $n$?; and 2) is there an elegant way to represent these values in closed form for general $n$?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "All sinc function integrals of the type $$I_n=\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\sin^n{(x)}}{x^n}\\mathrm{d}x$$ can be expressed using the following general form: $$\\displaystyle \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\sin^a{(x)}}{x^b}\\mathrm{d}x=\\frac{(-1)^{\\lfloor(a-b)/2 \\rfloor} \\cdot \\pi^ {1-c}}{   2^{a-c}(b-1)!}\\sum_{k=0}^{\\lfloor a/2-c \\rfloor     } (-1)^k { a \\choose k}(a-2k)^{b-1} Log^c(a-2k)    $$ where $a$ and $b$ and are positive integers, $c\\equiv (a-b) \\pmod 2$, and $\\lfloor  j \\rfloor $ denotes the floor function. When $a=b=n$, then $c=0$ and the equation simplifies in $$\\displaystyle I_n=\\frac{ \\pi}{   2^{n}(n-1)!}\\sum_{k=0}^{\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor }(-1)^k { n \\choose k}(n-2k)^{n-1} $$ so that you can obtain the rational coefficients for each $n$ by dividing the last expression to $\\pi$. This gives you the sequence 1/2, 1/2, 3/8, 1/3, 115/384, 11/40, 5887/23040, 151/630, 259723/1146880, 15619/72576, 381773117/1857945600, 655177/3326400..... The last equation can also be further simplified in $$\\displaystyle I_n=\\frac{n \\pi}{   2^{n}}\\sum_{k=0}^{\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor } \\frac{(-1)^k (n-2k)^{n-1}}{k!(n-k)!} $$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to format this Math Stack Exchange question according to the user's specified structure. Let me start by reading through the problem carefully.\n\nThe original question is about finding a closed form for the integral of integer powers of the sinc function. The user revised their question after getting some references, and now they want to know how to derive the closed form provided. The integral in question is defined as $\\mathcal{I}_n = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\sin^n(x)}{x^n} dx$, and they propose a specific closed-form expression involving a sum with factorials and a summation over k.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem states that $n$ is a natural number (positive integer), so that's one assumption. The integral is from 0 to infinity, and the integrand is $\\sin^n(x)/x^n$. The problem is to prove that this integral equals the given closed-form expression involving pi, a power of 2, and a summation. The original question also mentions specific cases for n from 1 to 8, but those examples are probably not needed in the assumptions since the problem is about the general case for all positive integers n. \n\nWait, the problem statement says \"for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}^+$\", so that's the key assumption here. The integral is defined for each positive integer n, and the closed form is to be proven for all such n. So the main assumption is that n is a positive integer. There's no mention of any other conditions or constraints on n, like parity (even or odd) or specific divisibility. The summation in the proposed closed form goes up to floor((n-1)/2), which is part of the expression but not an assumption—it’s part of the problem's statement.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should only include that n is a positive integer. The problem is to prove the equality of the integral and the closed-form expression. The user might have initially thought there was an assumption on n being within a certain range, but since the closed form is claimed for all positive integers, that's the only assumption needed.\n\nI should check if there's any other implicit assumptions. For example, does the integral converge for all n in N^+? The user provides examples up to n=8, but since the problem is stated for all n, the convergence is probably given or assumed. However, the user might be assuming that the integral exists for all positive integers n. But the way the problem is structured, the integral is defined, so existence is part of the problem's context. Therefore, the only explicit assumption is that n is a positive integer.\n\nSo, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n- n is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the definite integral $\\mathcal{I}_n = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\sin^n(x)}{x^n} dx$ has the closed form $$\\pi\\,2^{-n}\\left(n\\sum_{k=0}^{\\lfloor\\frac{n-1}{2}\\rfloor}\\frac{(-2)^k(n-2k)^{n-1}}{k!(n-k)!}\\right)$$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}^+$.\n\nWait, in the example provided by the user, the assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but in this case, n is just a positive integer. There's no additional condition like divisibility here.\n\nI think that's it. The problem is to prove the equality for all positive integers n. So the assumption is simply that n is a positive integer. The problem is the integral expression equals the closed-form given.",
