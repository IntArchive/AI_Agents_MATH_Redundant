    "Content": "Is there a purely algebraic proof of the Frobenius theorem? Here's a rough sketch of what i'm looking for: Let $Der(R)$ denote the $R$-module of ($R$-valued) derivations of the algebra $R$ endowed with the lie bracket given by the commutator. Definiton: A distribution $D$ is a submodule of $Der(R)$. \"Frobenius\" Theorem - Under certain restriction on the base algebra $R$ \n  (and on the algebra $S$ that will be introduced) the following holds: A distribution $D \\subset Der(R)$ is closed under the lie bracket of $Der(R)$ iff\n  for every maximal ideal $m \\subset R$ there exists an epimorphism $f: R \\to S$,  such that after localizing $R$ by $m$ and $S$ by $f(m)$ we have: $v \\in D_m \\iff \\exists u \\in Der(S)_{f(m)}$ satisfying $f_m \\circ v = u \\circ f_m$. I'm sure there is a \"nicer\" algebraic formulation of this problem but that's the best i could do with my current knowledge - any improvement suggestions would be very welcome. Is there such a general theorem? Does it even make sense? Denoting the exterior algebra of $Der(R)$ by $\\mathcal{A}^*$. Am i right that the following equivalence is purely algebraic and no geometric input is neaded? (i did prove it, i think... need to be sure): A distribution $D \\subset Der(R)$ is closed under the lie bracket $\\iff$ $I(D) = \\bigcup_k \\{\\omega \\in \\mathcal{A}^k : \\omega(m_1,...,m_k)=0  \\text{ for every tuple of elements } \\{m_i\\}_{i \\le k} \\subset D \\} \\subset \\mathcal{A}^*$ is a differential ideal . ($d I(D) \\subset I(D)$).",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This answer is not correct as stated! See the comments below. The correct statement is more subtle. I will correct this eventually i hope. Here's a (reasonably) algebraic proof of the Frobenius theorem (in the end there's a comment about the non-algebraic inputs of the proof): Frobenius theorem: Let $M$ be an $n$ -dimensional smooth manifold and let $D \\subset TM$ be an involutive sub-bundle $[D,D] \\subset D$ of rank $r$ .\nThen $D$ is integrable We first prove a slightly surprising lemma: Lemma 1: Let $D \\subset TM$ be as in the situation above. Then locally around any point $p\\in M$ there's a local frame $\\{X_1,...,X_r\\} \\subset \\mathfrak{X}(U)$ for $D|_U$ with vanishing lie bracket $[X_i,X_j]=0$ . Proof: Let $U$ be a small enough neighborhood of $p\\in M$ s.t. both $\\mathfrak{X}(U)$ and $\\Gamma(U,D)$ are free as modules over $R:=C^{\\infty}(U)$ -modules. Let $\\{Y_1,...,Y_r\\}$ and $\\{\\partial_1,...,\\partial_n\\}$ bases for $\\Gamma(U,D)$ and $\\mathfrak{X}(U)$ respectively. There's a unique matrix $A \\in M_{r \\times n}(R)$ satisfying: $$\n\\left( \n        \\begin{matrix}\n        Y_1 \\\\\n        \\vdots \\\\\n        Y_r \\\\\n        \\end{matrix}\n\\right)\n= A\n\\left( \n        \\begin{matrix}\n        \\partial_1 \\\\\n        \\vdots \\\\\n        \\partial_n \\\\\n        \\end{matrix}\n\\right)\n$$ The rank of $A$ must be $r$ and so up to relabeling of indices we may assume $A = (B|C)$ for some unique $B \\in GL_r(R)$ and $C \\in M_{r \\times n-r}(R)$ . We define the frame $\\{X_1,...,X_r\\}$ by: $$\n\\left( \n        \\begin{matrix}\n        X_1 \\\\\n        \\vdots \\\\\n        X_r \\\\\n        \\end{matrix}\n\\right)\n= B^{-1}\n\\left( \n        \\begin{matrix}\n        Y_1 \\\\\n        \\vdots \\\\\n        Y_r \\\\\n        \\end{matrix}\n\\right)\n= B^{-1}A\n\\left( \n        \\begin{matrix}\n        \\partial_1 \\\\\n        \\vdots \\\\\n        \\partial_n \\\\\n        \\end{matrix}\n\\right)\n$$ Since $B^{-1}A=(Id|B^{-1}C)$ we have $X_j =  \\partial_j+Z_j$ for some unique $Z_j \\in Span \\{\\partial_{r+1},..., \\partial_n\\}$ . By the above we have $[X_i,X_j] \\in Span \\{\\partial_{r+1},..., \\partial_n\\}$ . We recall now that $D$ is involutive so we also have $[X_i,X_j] \\in Span \\{X_1,...,X_r\\}$ . But clearly the module $Span \\{X_1,...,X_r\\} / Span \\{\\partial_{r+1},..., \\partial_n\\} \\cong Span \\{\\partial_1,...,\\partial_r\\}$ is free of rank $r$ and so we must have $Span \\{X_1,...,X_r\\} \\cap  Span \\{\\partial_{r+1},..., \\partial_n\\} = \\{0\\}$ . QED. We actually proved something slightly stronger. Namely that for any involutive distribution $\\mathcal{D} \\subset \\mathcal{T}_X$ there exists locally a retraction $\\mathcal{T}_X|_U \\to \\mathcal{D}|_U$ and a local frame of commuting vector fields for $D|_U$ which preserve $\\mathcal{I} = ker (\\mathcal{T}_X|_U \\to \\mathcal{D}|_U)$ under the lie bracket. Applying the theorem again to $\\mathcal{I}$ we get locally a retraction $\\mathcal{T}_X|_V \\to \\mathcal{I}|_V$ and a local frame for $\\mathcal{I}|_V$ consisting of commuting vector fields preserving $ker(\\mathcal{T}_X|_V \\to \\mathcal{I}|_V) \\cong \\mathcal{D}|_V$ under lie bracket. But since $\\mathcal{D}|_V \\cap \\mathcal{I}|_V = \\{0\\}$ and both are involutive the frames for $\\mathcal{D}|_V$ and $\\mathcal{I}|_V$ must commute with each other. We therefore have in fact proven the following very strong and surprising statement: Theorem: Any involutive distribution $D$ is locally spanned by a frame of commuting vector fields which extends to a local frame for the entire tangent bundle also consisting of mutually commuting vector fields. Proof of Frobenius theorem: The dual frame in $\\Omega^1_X$ of a commuting local frame for $TX$ consists entirely of closed 1-forms (this is a simple computation). By taking the dual of the frame in the theorem above we may apply Poincare's lemma to conclude that by sufficiently shrinking $U$ the basis of 1-forms can be lifted to a coordinate chart. A suitable projection will give the integrability of $D$ . QED. The only non-algebraic statements in the proof are the Poincare lemma (a closed form is locally exact) and the existence of a locally commuting frame field (which is apparently true in the algebraic setting ). A possible upshot of this is that the theorem generalizes immediately to the holomorphic case (by working everywhere with sheaves of modules over the sheaf of holomorphic functions and using the holomorphic poincare lemma).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this question. The user is asking about a purely algebraic proof of the Frobenius theorem on distributions. They want to know if such a proof exists and if their formulation makes sense. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the key assumptions. The problem mentions several algebraic structures. Let's start by listing each assumption one by one. \n\n1. They define Der(R) as the R-module of derivations with the Lie bracket given by the commutator. That's an assumption about the structure being used.\n2. A distribution D is a submodule of Der(R). So D is a submodule, which is another assumption.\n3. The theorem has certain restrictions on the base algebra R and the algebra S. The user isn't specific, so I'll note that there are unspecified restrictions on R and S.\n4. The conclusion is that D is closed under the Lie bracket if and only if for every maximal ideal m in R, there's an epimorphism f: R → S. After localizing, the condition relates elements of D_m to derivations on S.\n5. The user also mentions an alternative formulation using the exterior algebra and differential ideals. They claim equivalence without geometric input, so that's another condition to list as an assumption.\n\nNow, the problem itself is to prove this equivalence under those assumptions. The user is also asking if their formulation is correct and if such a theorem exists. However, following the example given, the formatted problem should focus on the main theorem to prove. \n\nI need to structure each assumption line by line, each addressing one property. Let me check the example again. The example lists each condition applied to one object. Here, each bullet should be a single assumption. For instance, Der(R) being an R-module with Lie bracket is one assumption. D being a submodule is another. The restrictions on R and S are another, even if they're vague. The localization condition is another. The equivalence involving the differential ideal is another assumption.\n\nSo, compiling this:\n\nAssumption:\nDer(R) is the R-module of R-valued derivations with the Lie bracket given by commutator,\nD is a submodule of Der(R),\nCertain restrictions are imposed on the base algebra R and the algebra S,\nFor every maximal ideal m in R, there exists an epimorphism f: R → S such that after localizing R at m and S at f(m), v ∈ D_m ⇨ there exists u ∈ Der(S)_{f(m)} satisfying f_m ∘ v = u ∘ f_m,\nThe ideal I(D) is defined as the union over k of {ω ∈ 𝒜^k : ω(m₁,…,m_k)=0 for all tuples {m_i} ⊂ D} and is a differential ideal (dI(D) ⊂ I(D)).\n\nProblem: Prove that D ⊂ Der(R) is closed under the Lie bracket if and only if I(D) is a differential ideal.\n\nWait, the original problem states the equivalence under two conditions: one involving the epimorphism f and localization, and the other involving the differential ideal. The user is asking if their equivalence (Lie bracket closure ⇨ differential ideal) is correct and if such a theorem exists. But in the problem statement, the user presents the Frobenius theorem as the equivalence between D being closed under Lie bracket and the existence of such epimorphisms f, and separately asks about the equivalence with the differential ideal. So the main problem is two parts? Or maybe the problem as per the user's question is to prove the equivalence between D being closed under Lie bracket and the differential ideal condition, under the given assumptions.\n\nBut the user's own problem statement says: \"A distribution D is closed under the lie bracket of Der(R) iff for every maximal ideal m...\". So the problem is to show that D is closed under Lie bracket iff that localization/epimorphism condition holds, and also separately asks if the equivalence with the differential ideal is correct.\n\nHowever, the example given in the original instruction shows that the formatted problem should capture the main problem to prove, given the assumptions. The user seems to have two parts: one part about the Frobenius theorem (iff condition with epimorphism/localization) and another about the equivalence with the differential ideal. But the user is asking if their formulation is correct and if such a theorem exists, which is a bit meta. However, following the example, perhaps the formatted problem should focus on the specific mathematical statement to prove, given the assumptions. So the main problem is proving that D is closed under Lie bracket iff I(D) is a differential ideal, under the listed assumptions. Alternatively, the problem could be to prove the Frobenius theorem as stated (the iff with the epimorphism/localization) under the given assumptions.\n\nBut the user's question is a bit complex. Let me re-express the original question:\n\nThey want a purely algebraic proof of Frobenius theorem. Their version of Frobenius theorem is: D is closed under Lie bracket iff for every maximal ideal m, there exists an epimorphism f: R→S such that after localizing, v ∈ D_m iff there exists u ∈ Der(S)_{f(m)} with f_m ∘ v = u ∘ f_m. Then they ask if their equivalence (using the differential ideal) is correct.\n\nSo perhaps the main problem is the first part (the iff with the epimorphism), and the second part is a separate question about the equivalence with the differential ideal. But in the example, the formatted problem was a single problem. Since the user mentions two parts, maybe the problem should be split. However, the user's own formatted example only included one problem. Since the user's question is a bit multi-part, but the example only has one problem, perhaps the assistant should focus on the main theorem statement.\n\nLooking at the user's problem statement again: The user wrote \"Prove that... is divisible by 91.\" In the example, the problem is to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 under the assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So, the formatted problem here should be the main theorem the user is asking about. The user's main question is: \"Is there a purely algebraic proof of the Frobenius theorem?\" and they present their version of the theorem. So the problem to format is the theorem statement they provided. The assumptions would include the definitions and conditions they set.\n\nSo, the problem is to prove that a distribution D is closed under Lie bracket iff for every maximal ideal m, there exists an epimorphism f: R→S with the localization property. The other part about the differential ideal is a separate question, but maybe the user is proposing that as an alternative formulation. However, the user is asking if their equivalence (the differential ideal part) is correct. But according to the example, the formatted problem should be the main problem statement. Hence, perhaps the formatted problem is to prove the Frobenius theorem as stated (the iff with the epimorphism), and the differential ideal part is a suggested approach or an additional question. But since the user includes both, perhaps we need to structure both parts. However, the example only has one problem. The user's question seems to have two parts: the Frobenius theorem statement and the equivalence with the differential ideal. But since the user is asking if their formulation is correct and if such a theorem exists, maybe the problem should be to establish the equivalence they mentioned. The user also asks for improvement suggestions on the formulation.\n\nBut following the example, the formatted problem should present the main mathematical statement to prove. So in this case, the main problem is the Frobenius theorem as stated by the user: D closed under Lie bracket iff for every maximal ideal m, there exists an epimorphism f... with the localization condition. Then the other part about the differential ideal is an alternative formulation they propose and want verified.\n\nHowever, the user's original question is a bit multi-faceted, but the example given only includes a single problem. Therefore, to adhere to the format, perhaps the problem part should be the main theorem statement: prove the equivalence between D being closed under Lie bracket and the existence of such epimorphisms f after localization. The assumptions would include the definitions of Der(R), D being a submodule, the restrictions on R and S, and the specific conditions on localization and epimorphism.\n\nBut the user also mentions the differential ideal equivalence. So maybe the problem is two-fold. But the example shows one problem. Since the user wrote \"the following holds: A distribution D ⊂ Der(R) is closed under the lie bracket...\", the problem is to prove that equivalence. The other part about the differential ideal is a separate question, but the user is also asking if that equivalence is correct. But in the formatting example, only one problem is listed. Given that, perhaps the main problem is the Frobenius theorem as stated, and the other part is a separate question. But since the user is asking both, maybe we need to structure both as separate problems. However, the example doesn't do that. \n\nAlternatively, since the user presents two equivalences (Lie bracket closure ⇨ epimorphism/localization and Lie bracket closure ⇨ differential ideal), perhaps the problem is to prove both equivalences under the listed assumptions. But I think the user is primarily asking about the Frobenius theorem and then their own proposed equivalence. Since the example only includes one problem, perhaps the main problem here is the Frobenius theorem as stated, with the assumptions listed.\n\nSo, compiling all of this, the assumptions would be:\n\n- Der(R) is the R-module of R-valued derivations with Lie bracket given by the commutator.\n- D is a submodule of Der(R).\n- Certain restrictions are imposed on the base algebra R and the algebra S.\n- For every maximal ideal m in R, there exists an epimorphism f: R → S such that after localizing R at m and S at f(m), the condition v ∈ D_m ⇨ ∃ u ∈ Der(S)_{f(m)} with f_m ∘ v = u ∘ f_m holds.\n- The ideal I(D) is defined as the union over k of {ω ∈ 𝒜^k | ω(m₁,…,m_k) = 0 for all {m_i} ⊂ D} and is a differential ideal (dI(D) ⊂ I(D)).\n\nWait, but the user's problem statement says \"the following holds: A distribution D is closed under the lie bracket iff for every maximal ideal...\". So the problem is to prove that equivalence. Then the user separately asks about the equivalence with the differential ideal. However, in formatting, the problem part should be the main statement to prove. So perhaps the problem is to prove the Frobenius theorem as stated (the iff with the epimorphism/localization), and the other part about the differential ideal is a separate problem. But the user's question includes both. Given the example provided, which only includes one problem, perhaps the assistant should focus on the main theorem the user is presenting, which is the Frobenius theorem part. The part about the differential ideal is an additional question but not the main problem. Alternatively, since the user mentions both, but the example structures only one problem, maybe it's better to capture both in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to show that D being closed under Lie bracket is equivalent to both conditions: the epimorphism/localization and the differential ideal. But the user's wording is a bit unclear. The user says \"Am I right that the following equivalence is purely algebraic... A distribution D is closed under the lie bracket iff I(D) is a differential ideal.\" So this is another equivalence they are proposing. Hence, there are two problems here: one is the Frobenius theorem (iff with epimorphism), and the other is the equivalence with the differential ideal. But the example only formats one problem. Given that, perhaps the user's main problem is the Frobenius theorem, and the other is a secondary problem. However, the user's original question is a bit of a mix. \n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps the correct approach is to list all assumptions related to the main problem (the Frobenius theorem) and present that as the problem. Then, the differential ideal part is a separate question but might need its own assumptions. However, the example given by the user includes assumptions that are split into separate lines. Let's try to parse step by step.\n\nOriginal problem's main theorem statement by the user: \"A distribution D ⊂ Der(R) is closed under the lie bracket of Der(R) iff for every maximal ideal m ⊂ R there exists an epimorphism f: R → S, such that after localizing R by m and S by f(m) we have: v ∈ D_m ⇨ ∃ u ∈ Der(S)_{f(m)} satisfying f_m ∘ v = u ∘ f_m.\"\n\nAssumptions needed for this theorem:\n\n1. Der(R) is an R-module of derivations with the Lie bracket as commutator.\n2. D is a submodule of Der(R).\n3. Certain restrictions on R and S (unspecified, but necessary for the theorem).\n4. The localization and epimorphism conditions are part of the problem's conclusion, not assumptions. Wait, no—the problem is to prove the equivalence. So the assumptions are the general conditions under which the theorem holds. The user mentions \"under certain restriction on the base algebra R (and on the algebra S that will be introduced)\", so that's an assumption. The problem is to prove the equivalence given those restrictions.\n\nSo, the assumptions would be:\n\n- Der(R) is the R-module of R-valued derivations with the Lie bracket given by the commutator.\n- D is a submodule of Der(R).\n- The base algebra R and the algebra S satisfy certain restrictions.\n- The user's alternative formulation involving I(D) being a differential ideal is a separate condition they propose as equivalent.\n\nBut the problem is to prove the original Frobenius theorem statement. The other part about I(D) is a separate question. However, the user is also asking if that equivalence is correct, so perhaps that's another problem. Given the example's structure, the assistant should format the main problem the user presents. So the main problem is the Frobenius theorem as stated, with the assumptions listed. The part about I(D) is an additional question, but since the example only includes one problem, perhaps we should focus on the main one.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nDer(R) is the R-module of R-valued derivations with the Lie bracket given by the commutator,\nD is a submodule of Der(R),\nCertain restrictions are imposed on the base algebra R and the algebra S.\n\nProblem:\nProve that a distribution D ⊂ Der(R) is closed under the Lie bracket of Der(R) if and only if for every maximal ideal m ⊂ R, there exists an epimorphism f: R → S such that after localizing R by m and S by f(m), v ∈ D_m ⇨ there exists u ∈ Der(S)_{f(m)} satisfying f_m ∘ v = u ∘ f_m.\n\nBut wait, the user's problem statement says \"closed under the lie bracket of Der(R) iff for every maximal ideal...\". So the problem is that equivalence. The assumptions would be the structure of Der(R), D being a submodule, and the restrictions on R and S. The user also mentions the differential ideal equivalence as something they think they proved and want to check. But according to the example, perhaps that's another assumption. But given the example, the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. Here, the problem is to prove the equivalence, given those assumptions. The user's own alternative formulation with I(D) is another equivalence they want validated, but perhaps that's a separate problem. Since the user is asking both about the existence of the algebraic Frobenius theorem and the correctness of their differential ideal equivalence, maybe we need to structure both. But the example only has one problem. Given the instructions, the assistant should format the problem as per the example, which includes one problem and its assumptions. Hence, focusing on the main theorem statement.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem would have the assumptions related to the algebraic structures and the problem being the equivalence in the Frobenius theorem. The part about the differential ideal is a separate question but might not fit into the single problem format. Therefore, the assistant should focus on the main theorem presented first.",
