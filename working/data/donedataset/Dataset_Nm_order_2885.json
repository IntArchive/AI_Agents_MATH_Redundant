    "AcceptedAnswer": "Consider $h>0$ then there is $n$ so that $ \\frac{1}{(n+1)\\pi +\\pi/2} < h\\le \\frac{1}{n\\pi + \\pi/2}$. In this interval (called $I_n$), $\\cos(1/t)$ is positive (resp. negative) if $n$ is odd (resp. even). Also $$\\int_0^h \\cos\\left(\\frac 1t\\right) dt = \\sum_{k=n+1}^\\infty \\int_{I_k} \\cos\\left(\\frac 1t\\right) dt + \\int_{\\frac{1}{(n+1)\\pi + \\pi/2}}^h \\cos\\left(\\frac 1t\\right) dt$$ Note that the last term is bounded by $\\frac{2}{\\pi n^2}$. On the other hand, if we let \n$$a_k = \\int_{I_k} \\cos\\left(\\frac 1t\\right) dt,$$\nand $a_k$ is an alternating sequence and $a_k \\to 0$. If $l> k$, then $|a_k| > |a_l|$ (see below). Thus we have $$\\left|\\sum_{k=n+1}^\\infty a_k\\right| \\le |a_{n+1}| \\Rightarrow \\left| \\sum_{k=n+1}^\\infty \\int_{I_k} \\cos\\left(\\frac 1t\\right) dt\\right| \\le \\int_{I_{n+1} }\\left| \\cos\\left(\\frac 1t\\right) \\right| dt \\le \\frac{2}{\\pi n^2}. $$ As $h \\in I_n$, $h > \\frac{1}{(n+1)\\pi + \\pi/2}> \\frac{1}{2\\pi n} \\Rightarrow \\frac{1}{h} < 2\\pi n$. Thus $$\\left|\\frac 1h\\int_0^h \\cos \\left(\\frac 1t \\right) dt \\right| \\le (2\\pi n) \\frac{4}{\\pi n^2} = \\frac{8}{n}.  $$ As $h\\to 0$, $n\\to \\infty$ and so the limit goes to zero. Remark: If we do the substitution $u = 1/t$, then \n$$a_k = \\int_{I_k} \\cos\\left(\\frac 1t\\right) dt = \\int_{k\\pi +\\pi/2}^{(k+1)\\pi + \\pi/2} \\frac{\\cos u}{u^2}  \\mathrm du \\Rightarrow |a_k| = \\int_{k\\pi +\\pi/2}^{(k+1)\\pi + \\pi/2} \\frac{|\\cos u|}{u^2}  \\mathrm du.$$ Now $|\\cos u|$ is $\\pi$-periodic, $|a_k|$ is strictly decreasing.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants to prove that the limit as h approaches 0 of (1/h times the integral from 0 to h of cos(1/t) dt) equals 0. The function f(t) is defined as cos(1/t) when t isn't zero and 0 otherwise. They mentioned not being able to assume an antiderivative exists, so integration techniques like substitution might not work here.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some calculus concepts. When dealing with limits involving integrals like this, maybe the Mean Value Theorem for integrals could be useful. The theorem states that if a function is continuous on [a, b], then there exists a point c in [a, b] such that the integral from a to b of the function equals the function evaluated at c times (b - a). But wait, here the function cos(1/t) isn't continuous at t=0 because it oscillates wildly as t approaches 0. So the Mean Value Theorem might not apply directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the integral's behavior as h approaches 0. Since the integral is from 0 to h, and we're dividing by h, this looks like the average value of the function over the interval [0, h]. If the function is bounded, then maybe the average value tends to zero. Let's check: cos(1/t) oscillates between -1 and 1, so the integral's absolute value is at most h. Therefore, dividing by h would give something bounded by 1 in absolute value. But we need to show it goes to zero, not just that it's bounded. So this approach might not be sufficient.\n\nAnother idea is to use substitution in the integral. Let me set u = 1/t, so when t approaches 0 from the right, u goes to infinity. Then dt = -du/u². Changing variables, the integral from t=0 to t=h becomes the integral from u=∞ to u=1/h. Flipping the limits, it's the integral from u=1/h to ∞ of cos(u) * (du/u²). So the integral becomes ∫_{1/h}^∞ cos(u)/u² du. Then (1/h) times this integral would be (1/h) * ∫_{1/h}^∞ cos(u)/u² du. Maybe integrating by parts here? Let's try integrating cos(u)/u². Let dv = cos(u) du, v = sin(u). Then u = 1/u², du = -2/u³ du. Wait, that might not be helpful. Alternatively, set v = -1/u², dv = (2/u³) du, but perhaps not. Let's think again.\n\nAlternatively, integrating by parts with u = cos(u) and dv = du/u². Then du = -sin(u) du, and v = -1/u. Wait, integrating ∫ cos(u)/u² du = [ -cos(u)/u ] - ∫ sin(u)/u du. So the integral becomes [ -cos(u)/u ] from 1/h to ∞ minus ∫ sin(u)/u du from 1/h to ∞. Let's evaluate the first part: as u approaches infinity, cos(u)/u goes to 0 since cos is bounded and 1/u tends to 0. So the first term is -0 + cos(1/h)/(1/h) = h cos(1/h). Then the second term is - ∫_{1/h}^∞ sin(u)/u du. The integral of sin(u)/u from a to ∞ is known to be convergent and approaches zero as a increases? Wait, actually the integral from 0 to ∞ of sin(u)/u du is π/2, but here we have from 1/h to ∞. So that integral would be π/2 minus the integral from 0 to 1/h of sin(u)/u du. But as h approaches 0, 1/h approaches infinity, so the integral from 1/h to ∞ of sin(u)/u du approaches zero. Wait, but when h approaches 0 from the positive side, 1/h approaches +infty. The integral from a to ∞ of sin(u)/u du is known to be O(1/a). So as a becomes large, the integral is bounded by 1/a. So putting this together, the integral ∫_{1/h}^∞ cos(u)/u² du equals h cos(1/h) minus [some term that is O(1/(1/h))] = O(h). Wait, this might not be right. Let me redo the integration by parts.\n\nLet me write the integral as ∫_{1/h}^∞ cos(u)/u² du. Let me set v = 1/u², dv = -2/u³ du, and let dw = cos(u) du, so w = sin(u). Then integration by parts gives v*w - ∫ w dv. So:\n\n= [sin(u)/u²]_{1/h}^∞ + 2 ∫_{1/h}^∞ sin(u)/u³ du.\n\nEvaluating the first term: at u=∞, sin(u)/u² tends to 0 because sin is bounded and 1/u² goes to 0. At u=1/h, it's sin(1/h)/( (1/h)^2 ) = h² sin(1/h). So the first term is 0 - h² sin(1/h) = -h² sin(1/h).\n\nThe remaining integral is 2 ∫_{1/h}^∞ sin(u)/u³ du. The absolute value of this integral is at most 2 ∫_{1/h}^∞ 1/u³ du = 2 * [ -1/(2u²) ]_{1/h}^∞ = 2*(0 - (-1/(2*(1/h)^2 )) = 2*( h²/2 ) = h². So the integral is bounded by h², so multiplying by 2 gives 2h². So overall, the original integral ∫_{1/h}^∞ cos(u)/u² du = -h² sin(1/h) + 2h² * O(1). Therefore, the integral is bounded by h² (|sin(1/h)| + 2), which is O(h²). Then when we multiply by (1/h), the entire expression becomes (1/h) * O(h²) = O(h), which tends to 0 as h approaches 0. Therefore, the limit is 0.\n\nWait, that seems to work. So by using integration by parts, we can show that the integral is of order h², so dividing by h gives something of order h, which goes to zero. Therefore, the limit is indeed zero. The key idea here is that even though cos(1/t) oscillates rapidly near zero, the integral averages out these oscillations, leading to a cancellation that results in the integral being small enough such that dividing by h still sends the expression to zero.\n\nAlternatively, another approach could be to use the squeeze theorem. Since |cos(1/t)| ≤ 1 for all t ≠ 0, then |∫0^h cos(1/t) dt| ≤ ∫0^h |cos(1/t)| dt ≤ ∫0^h 1 dt = h. Therefore, |(1/h) ∫0^h cos(1/t) dt| ≤ 1. But this only gives that the limit is bounded, not that it's zero. So we need a better bound.\n\nBut maybe by considering that the integral of a highly oscillatory function cancels out. For example, integrating cos(1/t) from 0 to h, as h approaches 0. The substitution u = 1/t gives an integral from u=1/h to infinity of cos(u)/u² du. This integral can be shown to behave like O(1/(1/h)^2) * oscillations, but more carefully, through integration by parts as before, leading to the conclusion that it's O(h²), hence when divided by h, it's O(h) which tends to zero.\n\nTherefore, the key steps are:\n\n1. Substitute u = 1/t to transform the integral into a more manageable form.\n2. Apply integration by parts to handle the oscillatory integral.\n3. Show that each term resulting from integration by parts is of order h².\n4. Conclude that dividing by h gives a term that tends to zero as h approaches 0.\n\nThis should suffice for the proof.",
