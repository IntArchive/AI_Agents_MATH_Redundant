    "Content": "$\\sin x^2$ does not converge as $x \\to \\infty$, yet its integral from $0$ to $\\infty$ does. I'm trying to understand why and would like some help in working towards a formal proof.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "$x\\mapsto \\sin(x^2)$ is integrable on $[0,1]$ , so we have to show that $\\lim_{A\\to +\\infty}\\int_1^A\\sin(x^2)dx$ exists. Make the substitution $t=x^2$ , then $x=\\sqrt t$ and $dx=\\frac{dt}{2\\sqrt t}$ . We have $$\\int_1^A\\sin(x^2)dx=\\int_1^{A^2}\\frac{\\sin t}{2\\sqrt t}dt=-\\frac{\\cos A^2}{2\\sqrt {A^2}}+\\frac{\\cos 1}2+\\frac 12\\int_1^{A^2}\\cos t\\cdot  t^{-3/2}\\frac{-1}2dt,$$ and since $\\lim_{A\\to +\\infty}-\\frac{\\cos A^2}{2\\sqrt {A^2}}+\\frac{\\cos 1}2=\\frac{\\cos 1}2$ and the integral $\\int_1^{+\\infty}t^{-3/2}dt$ exists (is finite), we conclude that $\\int_1^{+\\infty}\\sin(x^2)dx$ and so does $\\int_0^{+\\infty}\\sin(x^2)dx$ .\nThis integral is computable thanks to the residues theorem.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about proving that the integral of sin(x²) from 0 to infinity converges. \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem mentions the integral from 0 to ∞ of sin(x²) dx. The function involved is sin(x²), and the integral is improper because the upper limit is infinity. So the main assumptions here would relate to the function and the interval of integration.\n\nAssumptions should be one per line, each addressing a single property or condition of one object. Let's see:\n\n1. The function to integrate is sin(x²). So that's one assumption: The integrand is sin(x²).\n2. The integral is from 0 to infinity. So another assumption: The integral is over the interval [0, ∞).\n3. The integral is an improper Riemann integral. Since the interval is unbounded, we need to consider the limit as the upper bound approaches infinity. So maybe: The integral is improper at the upper limit.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't state that the integral is improper; it's implied by the bounds. Maybe the assumptions are about the function's behavior. For example, sin(x²) oscillates and doesn't converge as x approaches infinity, but its integral might converge conditionally. However, the problem is asking to prove convergence, so the assumptions would be the conditions under which the integral is considered—i.e., the integral from 0 to infinity of sin(x²) dx.\n\nBut according to the example provided, the assumptions are about the conditions given in the problem. In the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", which was split into \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" (though that seems like part of the problem statement, not an assumption). Wait, the example might have been altered. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But wait, the original problem didn't mention that n is divisible by 7; maybe that was part of the actual problem? Or perhaps the example had a mistake. Hmm.\n\nWait, no. Looking at the example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which would mean that the assumption is n is an integer, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. However, the formatted problem in the example adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. That seems incorrect. Maybe the example was from a different problem or there was a misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the example was a mistake. But the user provided it as an example. So perhaps in their example, they included an extra assumption that wasn't in the original problem. That might be an error. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a typo, and the correct problem was for n divisible by 7. But regardless, the user's example shows that assumptions are listed even if they are part of the problem's given conditions.\n\nSo applying that to the current problem: The problem is to prove that the integral of sin(x²) from 0 to infinity converges. The assumptions would be:\n\n- The integrand is sin(x²).\n- The integral is over [0, ∞).\n- The integral is improper at infinity.\n\nBut maybe the problem doesn't mention anything else. The original question states that sin(x²) does not converge as x approaches infinity, which is true because the function oscillates with increasing frequency but the amplitude remains constant (since |sin(x²)| ≤ 1), so the limit doesn't exist. But the integral might still converge conditionally due to the oscillations canceling out.\n\nSo the assumptions would be the basic conditions given in the problem. The problem is to prove convergence of the integral, so the key elements are the function sin(x²) and the interval from 0 to infinity. Therefore, the assumptions should list the function and the interval. But according to the example, each assumption is a single condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption: The integrand is sin(x²).\nAssumption: The integral is from 0 to ∞.\nAssumption: The integral is an improper Riemann integral.\n\nBut maybe \"improper\" is inherent in the interval being infinite. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption: The integral is taken over the interval [0, ∞).\n\nBecause that automatically makes it improper. Also, the integrand is sin(x²). Are there any other conditions? The problem mentions that sin(x²) does not converge as x→∞, but that's just a property of the function, not an assumption. The problem is asking to prove convergence despite that fact. So the assumptions would just be the integral's setup.\n\nTherefore, structured as:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integrand is sin(x²),\nThe integral is over the interval [0, ∞).\n\nProblem:\nProve that ∫₀^∞ sin(x²) dx converges.\n\nBut in the example, assumptions included more specific conditions. Wait, in the example, the original problem was \"for every integer n\", so the assumption was \"n is an integer\". Then the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. But the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which wasn't in the original. That suggests maybe there was a mistake in the example. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem had a typo, and the correct assumption included n divisible by 7. Without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nBut following the user's example, they listed two assumptions for the problem: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So perhaps in their example, the actual problem had a different condition, but the user made a mistake. But since the user provided that example, we have to follow their structure, even if the example is flawed.\n\nTherefore, applying that to the current problem: the original problem states that the integral from 0 to ∞ of sin(x²) dx converges. The question is to prove that. So the assumptions are:\n\n- The integrand is sin(x²).\n- The integral is over [0, ∞).\n\nThus, each on a separate line. Then the problem is to prove convergence.\n\nBut wait, the original question mentions \"sin x² does not converge as x→∞\", but that's just a statement about the function, not an assumption. So perhaps that's part of the problem motivation, but not an assumption. The assumptions are the given conditions of the problem. So the problem is to prove the integral converges, given that the function is sin(x²) and the interval is [0, ∞). The fact that the function doesn't converge as x→∞ is a property, not an assumption.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integrand is sin(x²),\nThe integral is over the interval [0, ∞).\n\nProblem:\nProve that ∫₀^∞ sin(x²) dx converges.\n\nThat seems to fit the example's structure, even if the example's assumptions included an extra condition. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, and the formatted problem included an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake unless the original problem actually had that condition. So perhaps the user's example is incorrect, but we have to follow their lead.\n\nIn any case, for the current problem, the key points are the function and the interval. So I'll structure it as such.",
