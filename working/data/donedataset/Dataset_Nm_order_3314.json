    "AcceptedAnswer": "ok so i took this with me on easter and found a proof. i'll post more details later, first only a few hints to get you started. as you already found out, $f|_{[0,\\frac{\\pi}{2}]}$ is injective; actually, for each $n\\in\\mathbb{Z}$, $f|_{[n\\frac{\\pi}{2},(n+1)\\frac{\\pi}{2}]}$ is injective. using the IVP, show that each $f|_{[n\\frac{\\pi}{2},(n+1)\\frac{\\pi}{2}]}$ is continuous, hence $f$ must be continuous everywhere. show that without loss of generality we can assume $f\\ge0$ and $f(-x)=f(x)$. show $f$ is periodic with period $\\pi$ (so $f$ attains its maximum and minimum at the endpoints of each $[n\\frac{\\pi}{2},(n+1)\\frac{\\pi}{2}]$) and a few more things to derive a contradiction using $x=0$ and $x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. you may or may not need the fact that $f$ has exactly one fixed point $x^*$, and $x^*\\in(0,1)$, and $x^*$ is also a fixed point of $\\cos^2(x)$ EDIT A solution is a function that satisfies andreea's problem (we want to prove that no such exists). Let $f$ denote any solution, unless stated otherwise. IVP stands for intermediate value property , and monotone refers to either monotonically increasing or monotonically decreasing . Lemma 1 Let $J$ be any set, $I\\subseteq J$ any subset, and $f:J\\rightarrow J$ any function. Then $$(f\\circ f)|_I \\quad \\text{is injective} \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad f|_I \\quad \\text{is injective.}$$ Proof Suppose $(f\\circ f)|_I$ is injective, $x,y\\in I$, and $f(x)=f(y)$. Then $f(f(x))=f(f(y))$, hence $x=y$. Take $J=\\mathbb{R}$, $n\\in\\mathbb{Z}$, $I=[n\\frac{\\pi}2,(n+1)\\frac{\\pi}2]$. Since $f\\circ f=\\cos^2$ and $\\cos^2|_{[n\\frac{\\pi}2,(n+1)\\frac{\\pi}2]}$ is injective, this yields: Proposition 1 $f|_{[n\\frac{\\pi}2,(n+1)\\frac{\\pi}2]}$ is injective. $\\quad$ Proposition 2 $f|_{[n\\frac{\\pi}2,(n+1)\\frac{\\pi}2]}$ is strictly monotone. Proof Suppose $f(n\\frac{\\pi}2)<f((n+1)\\frac{\\pi}2)$. We'll show that $f|_{[n\\frac{\\pi}2,(n+1)\\frac{\\pi}2]}$ is strictly monotonically increasing. Take $x,y\\in(n\\frac{\\pi}2,(n+1)\\frac{\\pi}2)$ such that $x<y$. Suppose $f(x)>f(y)$. Note that\n  $$ f(x)>\\max\\{f(n\\frac{\\pi}2),f(y)\\}\\quad\\text{or}\\quad f(y)<\\min\\{f(x),f((n+1)\\frac{\\pi}2)\\} $$\n  where the left equality holds whenever $f(n\\frac{\\pi}2)<f(x)$, and the right one whenever $f(y)<f((n+1)\\frac{\\pi}2)$ (there's some overlap, but this has no influence on the proof). In the 'left' case, by the IVP, $f$ must touch $\\max\\{f(n\\frac{\\pi}2),f(y)\\}$ at least twice on $[n\\frac{\\pi}2,y]$, in contradiction to injectivity. In the 'right' case, the same applies to $\\min\\{f(x),f((n+1)\\frac{\\pi}2)\\}$. Hence necessarily $f(x)<f(y)$. Analogously, if $f(n\\frac{\\pi}2)>f((n+1)\\frac{\\pi}2)$ then $f|_{[n\\frac{\\pi}2,(n+1)\\frac{\\pi}2]}$ is strictly monotonically decreasing. $\\quad$ Lemma 2 Let $a,b\\in\\mathbb{R}$, and $f:[a,b]\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ be a strictly monotone function with the IVP. Then $f$ is continuous. Proof Without loss of generality, assume $f$ is increasing; otherwise take $-f$, since 'taking the negative' doesn't influence continuity. Choose $x\\in[a,b]$ and $\\epsilon>0$. Note that, by the IVP, there exist $x_-,x_+\\in[a,b]$ such that\n  $$ f(x_-)=\\min\\{f(x)-\\epsilon, f(a)\\} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad f(x_+)=\\min\\{f(x)+\\epsilon, f(b)\\}$$\n  Set $\\delta=\\min\\{|x-x_-|,|x-x_+|\\}\\backslash\\{0\\}$ (i.e. we ignore the $x_-$ or $x_+$ term if $x_-=f(a)$ or $x_+=f(b)$, respectively). Then, for any $y\\in(x-\\delta,x+\\delta)\\cap[a,b]$, by monotonicity,\n  $$ f(x_-)\\le f(y)\\le f(x_+) $$\n  hence\n  $$ f(x)-\\epsilon<f(y)<f(x)+\\epsilon\\text. $$ Take $a=n\\frac{\\pi}2$, $b=(n+1)\\frac{\\pi}2$. Then $f|_{[n\\frac{\\pi}2,(n+1)\\frac{\\pi}2]}$ is continuous. In particular, $f(x)$ is both left continuous and right continuous at $x=n\\frac{\\pi}2$, for any $n\\in\\mathbb{Z}$, and we get: Proposition 3 $f$ is continuous. Note that, for any $x\\in\\mathbb{R}$,\n$$\nf(\\cos^2(x)) = \\cos^2(f(x)) \\in [0,1]\n$$\nThus we can define the (continuous) function $\\tilde f:\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow[0,\\pi]$ by\n$$\n\\tilde f(x)=\\arccos\\sqrt{f(\\cos^2(x))}\n$$\nIt is easy to see that $g$ is also a solution:\n$$\n\\tilde f(\\tilde f(x)) = \\arccos\\sqrt{f(\\cos^2(\\arccos\\sqrt{f(\\cos^2(x))}))}\n\\\\ = \\arccos\\sqrt{f(f(\\cos^2(x)))}\n\\\\ = \\arccos\\sqrt{\\cos^2(\\cos^2(x))}\n\\\\ = \\cos^2(x)\n$$\nWithout loss of generality, assume henceforth that $f=\\tilde f$. This gives: Proposition 4 $f$ is nonnegative $f$ is even $f$ is periodic with period $\\pi$. Note that $f(f(\\frac{\\pi}2))=0$, so $0\\in\\operatorname{im}f$ ; by periodicity and monotonicity, $f$ attains the value $0$ at one endpoint of each interval $[n\\frac{\\pi}2,(n+1)\\frac{\\pi}2]$. Focusing on the interval $[0,\\frac{\\pi}2]$, we have two cases: $f(0)=0$, or $f(\\frac{\\pi}2)=0$ If (1.), then\n$$\n0 = f(0) = f(f(0)) = \\cos^2(0) = 1 \\text;\n$$\nif (2.), then\n$$\n0 < f(0) = f(f(\\frac{\\pi}2)) = \\cos^2(\\frac{\\pi}2) = 0 \\text;\n$$\nboth contradictions. We conclude that no such $f$ exists.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem properly. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. Let me start by understanding the original problem.\n\nThe original question is titled: \"Show that there are no functions \\( f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R} \\) which have the intermediate value property and \\( f(f(x)) = \\cos^2(x) \\) for all \\( x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\).\" The user also mentions that they think \\( f(f(x)) \\in [0,1] \\) might be relevant but aren't sure how to proceed.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. The assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. The problem statement is what needs to be proven or shown.\n\nSo, the main assumptions here are:\n1. The function \\( f \\) maps from \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) to \\( \\mathbb{R} \\).\n2. The function \\( f \\) has the intermediate value property (Darboux property).\n3. The composition \\( f(f(x)) \\) equals \\( \\cos^2(x) \\) for all real numbers \\( x \\).\n\nEach of these should be listed as separate assumptions. Let me check if there are any more implicit assumptions. The problem states \"there are no functions,\" so the assumptions are the conditions that such a function would have to satisfy. There's no mention of continuity, differentiability, etc., except for the intermediate value property. Also, the codomain is \\( \\mathbb{R} \\), but \\( \\cos^2(x) \\) is always between 0 and 1. So, \\( f(f(x)) \\) is in [0,1], but \\( f(x) \\) itself can be any real number, though maybe with restrictions because of the composition.\n\nWait, the problem says \\( f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R} \\), so even though \\( f(f(x)) \\) is between 0 and 1, \\( f(x) \\) can be any real number. But perhaps there's an implicit assumption about the range of \\( f \\). However, the problem doesn't state that \\( f \\) has a restricted range; only the composition does. So maybe that's not an assumption but a consequence. So I shouldn't include that as an assumption. The explicit assumptions are the three I listed.\n\nTherefore, the formatted assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\n\\( f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R} \\),\n\\( f \\) has the intermediate value property,\n\\( f(f(x)) = \\cos^2(x) \\) for all \\( x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\).\n\nProblem:\nShow that there are no such functions \\( f \\).\n\nI need to ensure each assumption is on a separate line and addresses one property or condition of one object. Let's check:\n\n1. First assumption: The domain and codomain of \\( f \\).\n2. Second assumption: The intermediate value property (Darboux) of \\( f \\).\n3. Third assumption: The functional equation \\( f(f(x)) = \\cos^2(x) \\) for all real \\( x \\).\n\nEach is a separate condition on \\( f \\). So that should be correct.\n\nThe example given in the problem had two assumptions: \\( n \\) is an integer and \\( n \\) is divisible by 7. Each on separate lines, each addressing one property of one object. Similarly, here, each assumption is about \\( f \\)'s domain/codomain, its intermediate value property, and the functional equation. So this structure matches the example.\n\nI should make sure that there are no other hidden assumptions. The problem says \"there are no functions,\" so the three conditions are the only ones given. The user also mentions \\( f(f(x)) \\in [0,1] \\), but that's a consequence of \\( \\cos^2(x) \\) being in [0,1], not an assumption. Therefore, it's part of the problem's analysis, not an assumption to list.\n\nSo the formatted answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$,\n$f$ has the intermediate value property,\n$f(f(x)) = \\cos^2(x)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nProblem:\nShow that there are no functions $f$ satisfying the above.\n###\n\nThat's the structure. Let me verify against the example. In the example, the assumptions were about $n$ being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions are about the function's domain, its property, and the composition. Each on a separate line. The problem statement is to show non-existence. Yes, this matches the required format.",
