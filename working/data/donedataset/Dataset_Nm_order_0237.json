    "Content": "The problem is as follows: Prove or disprove that if ${F_{n}}$ is $n$ -th Fibonacci number, and $n>5$ , then $${F_{n}}^2 - 28$$ cannot be a prime. I came across this problem accidentally while trying to solve another problem. I suspect that there is an identity involving ${F_{n}}^2 - 28$ that proves that it is a composite. On the other hand, it is a kind of odd and counter-intuitive to imagine an identity involving number $28$ ...",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "${F_n}^2 - 28$ indeed can not be a prime number for $n>5$. Let's suppose that ${F_n}^2 - 28$ is a prime. In that case, $n$ must be even, this was shown (easily using congruences) in other answers, so I'll omit this part for space saving. I'll also use known identity $5{F_n}^2 = {L_n}^2 - 4$ valid for even $n$ ($L_n$ is $n$-th Lucas number). It follows that that: $$5({F_n}^2-28) = 5{F_n}^2-140 = ({L_n}^2 - 4) - 140 = {L_n}^2-144 = (L_n-12)(L_n+12)$$ ${F_n}^2 - 28$ could be prime only if one of $L_n - 12$ and $L_n + 12$ are $1$, $5$, $-1$,  $-5$, and those are just few cases of small $n$. For all others, ${F_n}^2 - 28$ can not be a prime . Possible generalization : Expressions ${F_n}^2 - (k^2 - 4)/5$ (k is any natural number) could be candidates for a similar proof. However, some other bits and peaces (like proving that $n$ must be even) must be valid too, and this is often not true. However, it looks that, for instance, ${F_n}^2 - 145$ satisfies all conditions, and also can be reduced to $({L_n}^2 - 4) - 725$ and finally to $(L_n-27)(L_n+27)$. Outside such generalization, it seems that the original statement (or its slightly modified version related only to condition $n>5$) is valid for ${F_n}^2 - 13$, ${F_n}^2 - 31$, ${F_n}^2 - 45$, ${F_n}^2 - 58$, ${F_n}^2 - 78$, ${F_n}^2 - 85$, ${F_n}^2 - 91$, ${F_n}^2 - 115$, ${F_n}^2 - 133$, ${F_n}^2 - 142$, ${F_n}^2 - 154$, ${F_n}^2 - 175$, ${F_n}^2 - 211$, ${F_n}^2 - 217$. (warning: I checked then with the help of a computer, and only for $n<1000$; please see comments for an interesting example involving $n>1000$) Now, for the sake of curiosity, let us take a look at one of these cases. Case ${F_n}^2 - 85$ can be proven using congruences for $2$, $3$, $17$, and $107$ only. This means that one of $2$, $3$, $17$, and $107$ is always a divisor of ${F_n}^2 - 85$. Original case ${F_n}^2 - 28$ is fundamentally different, and, if I may say, \"more beautiful\", in the sense that it can have (and often has) only huge divisors, like in these examples: $${F_{20}}^2 - 28 = 3023\\times15139$$\n$${F_{172}}^2 - 28 = 10348333\\times53505724471\\times315619755257\\times10455376853041\\times82024860865049\\times1040059595540327$$ For users of Mathematica, this code: Select[Table[Fibonacci[n], {n, 1, 1000}], PrimeQ[#*# + 3] &] returns primes of the form ${F_n}^2+3$, for $1\\le n\\le 1000$. In this case there are $6$ such primes: { 2,\n\n 8,\n\n 3524578,\n\n 27777890035288, \n\n 2011595611835338993891308327102733537615455242513357158345612749706882\\\n 9146295425939723629305572732574726246290673965789878845363842331040064\\\n 16432124798818261534841714338,\n\n 2949592466076064248964701302014885591673737506156850406413751530665307\\\n 5810241060939483954895520932111023343610904846943097162533007651451709\\\n 723277579925520157875345780869307228929160 }",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is whether Fₙ² - 28 is always composite when n > 5, where Fₙ is the nth Fibonacci number. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the Fibonacci sequence definition. The Fibonacci numbers are defined by F₀ = 0, F₁ = 1, and Fₙ = Fₙ₋₁ + Fₙ₋₂ for n ≥ 2. So, starting from n=0, the sequence goes 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, etc. The problem states n > 5, so we're looking at F₆ onwards. Let's check F₆: F₆ is 8, so 8² - 28 = 64 - 28 = 36, which is 6², composite. F₇ is 13, 13² -28 = 169 -28=141. 141 is 3×47, composite. F₈ is 21, 21²=441-28=413. Wait, 413... let's check if that's prime. Divided by 7: 7×59=413, so composite. F₉=34, 34²=1156-28=1128. That's even, so divisible by 2. Definitely composite. F₁₀=55, 55²=3025-28=2997. Let's see, 2997 divided by 3: 3×999=2997, so composite. Hmm, so up to n=10, it's composite. \n\nSo the initial examples support the claim. Now, the task is to prove that for all n >5, Fₙ² -28 is composite. The user mentioned suspecting an identity that factors this expression. Let's try to factor Fₙ² -28. The form is a² - b, which might not factor easily unless 28 is a square. But 28 is not a perfect square. Wait, maybe there's a way to express it as a product of two integers greater than 1. Alternatively, maybe modulo considerations can show it's divisible by some number, hence composite.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using properties of Fibonacci numbers. For example, Fibonacci numbers have periodic properties modulo m. If we can show that Fₙ² ≡28 mod some integer k, then Fₙ² -28 would be divisible by k, hence composite if k is between 1 and Fₙ² -28. But which k?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Fₙ² -28 can be written as a product of two integers. Let's try manipulating the expression. Let's see:\n\nFₙ² -28 = (Fₙ - a)(Fₙ + a) if 28 were a square. But 28 isn't a square, so that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe express 28 as something related to Fibonacci numbers. Wait, 28 is 5² + 3, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe relate to Fibonacci identities. For instance, there's an identity that Fₙ² = Fₙ₋₁Fₙ₊₁ + (-1)ⁿ⁺¹. Let's check that. For example, F₆=8, F₅=5, F₇=13. Then F₆²=64, F₅F₇ + (-1)^7=5×13 -1=65-1=64. Yes, that works. So Fₙ² = Fₙ₋₁Fₙ₊₁ + (-1)^{n+1}. Therefore, Fₙ² -28 = Fₙ₋₁Fₙ₊₁ + (-1)^{n+1} -28. Not sure if that helps directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe look for small primes dividing Fₙ² -28. Let's check modulo small primes like 2,3,5,7, etc. For example, let's compute Fₙ² -28 modulo 7. Fibonacci numbers modulo 7 have a period called the Pisano period. The Pisano period modulo 7 is 16. Let's see:\n\nF₀=0, F₁=1, F₂=1, F₃=2, F₄=3, F₅=5, F₆=1 (mod7), F₇=6, F₈=0, F₉=6, F₁₀=6, F₁₁=5, F₁₂=4, F₁₃=2, F₁₄=6, F₁₅=1, F₁₆=0, F₁₇=1, etc. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here, let me compute F₆ mod7: F₆=8, which is 1 mod7. F₇=13 mod7=6. F₈=21 mod7=0. F₉=34 mod7=34-28=6. F₁₀=55 mod7=55-49=6. F₁₁=89 mod7=89-84=5. F₁₂=144 mod7=144-140=4. F₁₃=233 mod7=233-231=2. F₁₄=377 mod7=377-371=6. F₁₅=610 mod7=610-609=1. F₁₆=987 mod7=987-980=7→0. So Pisano period modulo 7 is 16.\n\nNow, compute Fₙ² -28 mod7. 28 mod7=0, so Fₙ² mod7. From above, let's compute Fₙ mod7 and square it:\n\nFor n=6: F₆=1 mod7, so 1²=1. 1 -0=1 mod7, so F₆²-28≡1 mod7≠0. Hmm, not divisible by7. For n=7: F₇=6 mod7, 6²=36≡1 mod7. 1-0=1 mod7. Not divisible. n=8: F₈=0 mod7, 0²=0. 0-0=0 mod7. So F₈²-28=0 mod7. So divisible by7. Then F₈=21, 21²-28=441-28=413. 413/7=59, which is prime, but 413=7×59. So F₈²-28=7×59, which is composite. Similarly, for n=9: F₉=34. 34 mod7=6. 6²=36≡1 mod7. 1-0=1 mod7. Not divisible by7. n=10: F₁₀=55 mod7=6. 6²=36≡1 mod7. So 1 mod7. Not divisible. n=11: F₁₁=89. 89 mod7=5. 5²=25≡4 mod7. 4 mod7. Not divisible. n=12: F₁₂=144 mod7=4. 4²=16≡2 mod7. 2 mod7. Not divisible. n=13: F₁₃=233 mod7=2. 2²=4. 4 mod7. Not divisible. n=14: F₁₄=377 mod7=6. 6²=36≡1 mod7. 1 mod7. Not divisible. n=15: F₁₅=610 mod7=1. 1²=1. 1 mod7. Not divisible. n=16: F₁₆=987 mod7=0. 0²=0. 0 mod7. So F₁₆²-28 is divisible by7. So every time n is a multiple of 8 (since F₈=21, n=8, 16, etc.), Fₙ²-28 is divisible by7. But when n=8, the result is 7×59, composite. When n=16, F₁₆=987, 987²=974169. 974169-28=974141. Divide by7: 974141 ÷7. Let's check: 7×139,000=973,000. 974141-973,000=1,141. 1,141 ÷7=163 (7×160=1120, 7×163=1141). So 7×139163=974,141. So 974,141=7×139163. Both primes? Not sure, but 139163 might be prime. Wait, but the problem says n>5. So for n=8,16,... divisible by7, but 7 is a factor. However, when n=8, Fₙ²-28=413=7×59, both primes. But 413 is composite. For n=16, it's 7×139163, which is composite. But for other n not multiples of 8, it's not divisible by7. So maybe there are other primes.\n\nAlternatively, check modulo other numbers. Let's try modulo 3. Fₙ mod3 has Pisano period 8. Let's compute Fₙ mod3:\n\nF₀=0, F₁=1, F₂=1, F₃=2, F₄=0, F₅=2, F₆=2, F₇=1, F₈=0, F₉=1, etc. So period of 8.\n\nFₙ² -28 mod3. 28 mod3=1. So Fₙ² -1 mod3. Which factors as (Fₙ -1)(Fₙ +1) mod3. If Fₙ ≡0,1,2 mod3. Let's see:\n\nIf Fₙ≡0 mod3: 0² -1 ≡ -1 ≡2 mod3. Not 0.\n\nIf Fₙ≡1 mod3: 1-1=0 mod3. So Fₙ²-28≡0 mod3. So when Fₙ≡1 mod3, divisible by3.\n\nIf Fₙ≡2 mod3: 4-1=3≡0 mod3. So when Fₙ≡2 mod3, also divisible by3. Wait, that can't be. Wait, 2²=4≡1 mod3. 1 -1=0 mod3. So Fₙ≡2 mod3: Fₙ²-28≡1 -1=0 mod3. So Fₙ≡1 or 2 mod3, then Fₙ² -28≡0 mod3. But Fₙ can only be 0,1, or 2 mod3. Wait, Fₙ in Fibonacci sequence mod3: from the Pisano period, the residues are 0,1,1,2,0,2,2,1,0,1,... So for n≥0:\n\nn : Fₙ mod3\n\n0:0\n\n1:1\n\n2:1\n\n3:2\n\n4:0\n\n5:2\n\n6:2\n\n7:1\n\n8:0\n\n9:1\n\n10:1\n\n11:2\n\n12:0\n\nSo for n=1,2:1 mod3 → Fₙ²-28≡0 mod3.\n\nn=3:2 mod3 → Fₙ²-28≡0 mod3.\n\nn=4:0 mod3 → not divisible.\n\nn=5:2 mod3 → divisible.\n\nn=6:2 mod3 → divisible.\n\nn=7:1 mod3 → divisible.\n\nn=8:0 → not.\n\nSo except when Fₙ≡0 mod3, which happens at n=0,4,8,12,..., the expression is divisible by3. For n>5, let's check n=6: F₆=8, 8 mod3=2. So divisible by3. 8²-28=64-28=36, which is 3×12, composite. n=7:13 mod3=1. 13²-28=141. 141/3=47, composite. n=8:21 mod3=0. 21²-28=413. Not divisible by3. But earlier we saw it's divisible by7. So for n=8, divisible by7. For n=9:34 mod3=1. 34²-28=1128. 1128/3=376, composite. n=10:55 mod3=1. 55²-28=2997. 2997/3=999, composite. So for n>5, when Fₙ≡0 mod3 (which occurs at n=8,12,16,...), Fₙ²-28 is not divisible by3, but in those cases, like n=8, it's divisible by7. So for all n>5, Fₙ²-28 is divisible by either3 or7 (or both), except perhaps cases where it's divisible by neither. Wait, but let's check n=4: F₄=3, 3²-28=9-28=-19, which is prime. But n=4 is excluded since the problem states n>5. So for n>5, when Fₙ≡0 mod3 (n=8,12,16...), Fₙ²-28 is divisible by7. For other n>5, Fₙ²-28 is divisible by3. Hence, Fₙ²-28 is divisible by either3 or7 for n>5, which would make it composite, since 3 and7 are primes, and Fₙ²-28 is greater than3 and7 for n>5. \n\nWait, let's confirm for n>5: F₆=8, 8²-28=36, which is 3×12. F₇=13, 13²-28=141=3×47. F₈=21, 21²-28=413=7×59. F₉=34, 34²-28=1156-28=1128=3×376. F₁₀=55, 55²=3025-28=2997=3×999. F₁₁=89, 89²=7921-28=7893. 7893/3=2631. So divisible by3. Similarly, n=12: F₁₂=144. 144²=20736-28=20708. 20708 divided by3: 2+0+7+0+8=17, 17 mod3=2, so not divisible by3. But wait, F₁₂=144, which is Fₙ=144. n=12. From earlier, F₁₂ mod3=0. Because n=12: F₁₂=144, which is 0 mod3. So F₁₂²-28=144²-28=20736-28=20708. Check if divisible by7: 20708/7=2958.285..., wait 7×2958=20706, 20708-20706=2, so remainder2. So not divisible by7. Wait, this contradicts previous reasoning. Wait, n=12. F₁₂=144. So according to the previous analysis, n=12, which is a multiple of 4 (since the period mod3 is 8, but residues at n=4,8,12,... are 0). So F₁₂ mod3=0. So according to earlier reasoning, Fₙ²-28 should be divisible by7? Let's check: F₁₂=144. 144²-28=20736-28=20708. Check divisibility by7: 20708 ÷7: 7×2958=20706. 20708-20706=2. So remainder2. Not divisible by7. Hmm, so my previous conclusion was wrong. Wait, maybe the period for divisibility by7 is different. Earlier when n=8, F₈=21, 21²-28=413=7×59. For n=16: F₁₆=987, 987²-28=974169-28=974141. 974141 ÷7: Let's compute 7×139,000=973,000. 974,141 -973,000=1,141. 1,141 ÷7=163. So 7×139,163=974,141. So divisible by7. But n=12, F₁₂=144: 144²-28=20708 not divisible by7. So the period for divisibility by7 is every 8 terms? Wait, n=8,16,24 etc. But n=24 would be F₂₄=46368. Let's check F₂₄²-28. That's a big number, but let's check modulo7. F₈=21≡0 mod7, F₉=34≡6 mod7, F₁₀=55≡6 mod7, F₁₁=89≡5 mod7, F₁₂=144≡4 mod7, F₁₃=233≡2 mod7, F₁₄=377≡6 mod7, F₁₅=610≡1 mod7, F₁₆=987≡0 mod7. So the Pisano period mod7 is 16, and Fₙ≡0 mod7 when n is a multiple of 8 (since F₈=21, F₁₆=987, etc.). Wait, but F₈=21≡0 mod7, F₁₆=987≡0 mod7, F₂₄=46368≡0 mod7. So every n=8,16,24,..., which are multiples of8, Fₙ≡0 mod7. So for these n, Fₙ²-28≡0²-28≡-28≡0 mod7. So divisible by7. For other n, not divisible by7. So in the case of n=12, which is not a multiple of8, but F₁₂=144≡4 mod7. 4²=16≡2 mod7. 2-28≡2-0=2 mod7. So not divisible by7. Similarly, n=12, F₁₂=144, which is divisible by3 (144=48×3). So F₁₂²-28=20708. Let's check if this is composite. 20708: even? No, ends with8, so yes, divisible by2. 20708 ÷2=10354. So 2×10354, hence composite. Wait, but earlier for n=8, F₈=21, 21²-28=413=7×59, composite. For n=12, 20708=2×10354, which is composite. So for n=12, even though it's not divisible by3 or7, it's even. Wait, but when is Fₙ even? Fibonacci numbers are even every third term starting from F₃. F₀=0, F₁=1, F₂=1, F₃=2, F₄=3, F₅=5, F₆=8, F₇=13, F₈=21, F₉=34, F₁₀=55, F₁₁=89, F₁₂=144, etc. So even numbers at n=3,6,9,12,15,... So for n>5, n=6,9,12,15,..., Fₙ is even. So Fₙ²-28 would be even squared minus28. Even squared is divisible by4, 28=4×7. So Fₙ² is divisible by4, so Fₙ² -28=4k -4×7=4(k-7). Thus, for even Fₙ, Fₙ²-28 is divisible by4. Hence, composite unless it's 4 itself. But Fₙ≥8 for n≥6. So F₆=8: 8²=64. 64-28=36=4×9. Composite. F₉=34:34²=1156. 1156-28=1128=4×282. Composite. So whenever Fₙ is even (n divisible by3), Fₙ²-28 is divisible by4, hence composite.\n\nPutting this together:\n\nFor n>5:\n\n- If n is divisible by3, then Fₙ is even (since F₃=2, F₆=8, F₉=34, etc.), so Fₙ²-28 is divisible by4, hence composite.\n\n- If n is not divisible by3, then Fₙ is odd. For these n, check divisibility by3 or7.\n\nWait, let's re-express:\n\nFor n>5:\n\nCase1: n ≡0 mod3. Then Fₙ is even. Fₙ²-28 divisible by4 ⇒ composite.\n\nCase2: n ≡1 or2 mod3. Then Fₙ is odd. For these, check if Fₙ²-28 is divisible by3 or7.\n\nBut earlier when n ≡1 or2 mod3, Fₙ≡1 or2 mod3, so Fₙ²≡1 mod3. Hence Fₙ²-28≡1 -1=0 mod3. So divisible by3. Hence, composite.\n\nExcept when Fₙ²-28=3 itself. But for n>5, Fₙ≥8 (n=6: F₆=8). 8²-28=36, which is 3×12. So Fₙ²-28 is at least36-28=36, which is 3×12. So Fₙ²-28 is divisible by3 and greater than3, hence composite.\n\nWait, but wait: If Fₙ²-28 is divisible by3, but Fₙ²-28 could be 3×k where k is an integer. For it to be prime, 3×k would have to be prime, which requires k=1, so Fₙ²-28=3. So Fₙ²=31. But 31 is not a perfect square. So no solution. Hence, Fₙ²-28 is divisible by3 and greater than3, so composite.\n\nBut wait, let's check n=5: F₅=5. 5²-28=25-28=-3. But n>5 is required, so n=6 onwards. So for all n>5, Fₙ²-28 is divisible by either4 or3 or7, hence composite.\n\nBut wait, let's check n=7: F₇=13, which is not divisible by3, and n=7 is not divisible by3. So n=7 ≡1 mod3. Then F₇=13≡1 mod3. So F₇²-28=169-28=141. 141=3×47, composite. Similarly, n=8: divisible by7. n=9: divisible by4. n=10:55≡1 mod3. 55²-28=2997. 2997=3×999. Composite. n=11:89≡2 mod3. 89²-28=7921-28=7893=3×2631. Composite. n=12:144 even, so divisible by4. n=13:233≡2 mod3. 233²-28=54289-28=54261. 5+4+2+6+1=18, divisible by3. So 54261=3×18087. Composite. n=14:377≡1 mod3. 377²=142129-28=142101. Sum digits:1+4+2+1+0+1=9, divisible by3. So composite. And so on.\n\nThus, for all n>5, Fₙ²-28 is divisible by either3,4, or7, and since the number itself is greater than any of these divisors (for n>5, F₆=8, 8²-28=36>3,4,7), it must be composite. Hence, the expression is always composite for n>5.",
