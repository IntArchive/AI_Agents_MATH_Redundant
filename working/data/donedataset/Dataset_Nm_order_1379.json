    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so the user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me start by reading the original problem carefully. The title is about proving that the dual space of l^p is isomorphic to l^q when 1/p + 1/q = 1. The question body mentions defining a map J from l^q to the dual of l^p, and the user has already shown some parts but needs help with the norm inequality and surjectivity.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that 1/p + 1/q = 1 and that 1 < p < ∞. These are key assumptions. The objects involved are the spaces l^p and l^q, and the map J between them. Each assumption should be a single line addressing one property. So, I should list the conditions on p and q, and maybe the definitions of the spaces, but since the problem is about dual spaces, perhaps the main assumptions are the exponents.\n\nWait, the problem defines J and mentions that they've verified Jy is in the dual, J is linear, and the norm inequality in one direction. But the user is asking about the reverse inequality and surjectivity. However, for the assumptions part, I should only include the given conditions, not the parts they've already solved. So the main assumptions are p and q being conjugate exponents with 1 < p < infinity. The problem is to prove the dual of l^p is isomorphic to l^q under these conditions via the map J, specifically showing the norm equality and surjectivity.\n\nSo putting that together:\n\nAssumptions:\n- 1 < p < ∞\n- 1/q + 1/p = 1\n- The dual space of l^p is considered\n- The map J: l^q → (l^p)' is defined by Jy(x) = ∑x_k y_k for x in l^p, y in l^q\n\nWait, but the problem statement in the user's example didn't include all the setup as assumptions. For example, in the example, the assumption was n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, the problem is to prove the isomorphism, given that p and q satisfy Hölder conjugates, and 1 < p < ∞. The map J is part of the problem setup, so maybe that should be listed as an assumption as well. Each assumption should be a single line. Let me check the example again. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. The original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, actually in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. Wait, but that seems like the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7. Wait, maybe the example was modified. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. So perhaps in that case, the user added an extra assumption. Hmm, maybe the example had a mistake. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example? Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", which means n is any integer, but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That would change the problem. Maybe the example is incorrect. But regardless, the user's instruction is to list all the assumptions in the original problem. So perhaps in the given problem about dual spaces, the assumptions are the conditions on p and q, and the definition of the map J. But the problem statement says \"Define a map J...\" so that is part of the problem setup. The user is asking to structure the problem as per the example. So in the example, the original problem had an assumption (n is an integer) but the formatted problem added another assumption (n divisible by 7). Wait, that seems inconsistent. Maybe the example was a bad one. But the user is asking to follow the format, so perhaps we need to list all the given conditions as assumptions, each on a separate line.\n\nLooking at the problem here: the title says \"Prove the dual space of l^p is isomorphic to l^q if 1/q +1/p=1\". The question body adds that 1 < p < ∞, and defines the map J. So the assumptions are:\n\n- 1 < p < ∞\n- 1/q + 1/p = 1\n- The dual space (l^p)' is considered\n- The map J: l^q → (l^p)' is defined by Jy(x) = sum_{k=1}^\\infty x_k y_k for x in l^p, y in l^q\n- Jy is in (l^p)' (verified by the user)\n- J is linear (verified)\n- ||Jy|| ≤ ||y||_q (verified)\n\nBut the user is asking how to show ||Jy|| ≥ ||y||_q and that J is surjective. So perhaps the assumptions should include the conditions on p and q, the definition of J, and the already verified parts. Wait, but in the example, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n...\" and the formatted problem lists assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". However, the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7; that seems like an added assumption. Maybe the example is incorrect. But perhaps the user intended that in the example, the original problem had a mistake or was modified. Alternatively, maybe the example is structured to include both given conditions and any hidden assumptions. But since the user is asking to follow that format, I should replicate that approach.\n\nIn the current problem, the user has already done some steps (verified J is linear, etc.), but the problem is to show the other inequality and surjectivity. However, in the problem statement, those verified parts are part of the setup. So when structuring the problem, should we include those as assumptions? The example didn't include the steps the user had already done. The example's original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, and the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. So maybe in that example, the user made a mistake. But perhaps the correct approach is to list all the given conditions as assumptions, each on their own line.\n\nSo for the current problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- 1 < p < ∞\n- 1/q + 1/p = 1\n- The dual space of l^p is considered.\n- The map J: l^q → (l^p)' is defined by Jy(x) = ∑_{k=1}^∞ x_k y_k for x ∈ l^p, y ∈ l^q\n- Jy ∈ (l^p)' (verified)\n- J is linear (verified)\n- ||Jy|| ≤ ||y||_q (verified)\n\nProblem: Show that ||Jy|| ≥ ||y||_q and that J is surjective.\n\nBut the user's example might have condensed the assumptions. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like an added assumption not in the original problem. Perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user wants us to follow that format. Alternatively, maybe the example was a misrepresentation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem statement. In the current problem, the problem states that 1 < p < ∞ and 1/q +1/p =1. The map J is defined. So the assumptions are:\n\n- 1 < p < ∞\n- 1/q + 1/p = 1\n- J: l^q → (l^p)' is defined by Jy(x) = ∑_{k=1}^∞ x_k y_k\n\nThe verified parts (Jy is in the dual, J is linear, norm inequality) are part of the progress made, but the problem itself is to show the reverse inequality and surjectivity. So those verified parts might not be assumptions but rather partial results. Therefore, the assumptions are the initial conditions given in the problem, not the steps the user has already done.\n\nTherefore, the correct assumptions are:\n\n- 1 < p < ∞\n- 1/q + 1/p = 1\n- The dual space of l^p is considered\n- The map J: l^q → (l^p)' is defined by Jy(x) = ∑_{k=1}^∞ x_k y_k for x ∈ l^p, y ∈ l^q\n\nBut perhaps \"the dual space of l^p is considered\" is redundant since the problem is about the dual space. Maybe the main assumptions are the exponents. Let's check the example again. In the example, the assumptions were \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". The original problem was \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect unless the original problem had that condition. Maybe there was a mistake. However, given that the user provided that example, perhaps the instruction is to list all the conditions that are necessary for the problem, even if some are implicit.\n\nIn the current problem, the title says \"Prove the dual space of l^p is isomorphic to l^q if 1/q +1/p=1\". The problem statement in the question body adds \"1 < p < ∞\". So the assumptions are:\n\n- 1 < p < ∞\n- 1/q + 1/p = 1\n- The map J is defined as Jy(x) = sum x_k y_k\n\nThe rest (Jy being in the dual, linearity, norm inequality) are verified by the user and are not assumptions but partial results. Therefore, they shouldn't be in the assumptions. The problem is to show the other direction and surjectivity. Therefore, the formatted problem should include the conditions given, not the progress made.\n\nHence:\n\nAssumption:\n- 1 < p < ∞\n- 1/q + 1/p = 1\n- The map J: l^q → (l^p)' is defined by Jy(x) = ∑_{k=1}^∞ x_k y_k for x ∈ l^p, y ∈ l^q\n\nProblem: Show that ||Jy|| ≥ ||y||_q and that J is surjective.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to prove the dual space is isomorphic to l^q, which includes showing J is an isometric isomorphism. So the problem is to complete the proof by showing the norm equality and surjectivity.\n\nYes, so the problem is: Prove that the dual space of l^p is isomorphic to l^q under the given conditions, which requires showing J is an isomorphism, i.e., linear, bijective, and isometric. The user has done part of it, and the remaining parts are the norm inequality and surjectivity.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are the conditions on p and q, and the definition of J. The problem is to show the norm equality and surjectivity.",
