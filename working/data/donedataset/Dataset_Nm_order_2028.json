    "Content": "Let $f : M \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ be a differentiable function defined on a riemannian manifold. Assume that $| \\mathrm{grad}f | = 1$ over all $M$. Show that the integral curves of $\\mathrm{grad}f$ are geodesics.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Since this seems to be homework, here is just an outline of the proof. Show that the map $X\\rightarrow \\nabla_X \\nabla f$ is self adjoint, that is, that $g(\\nabla_X \\nabla f, Y) = g(\\nabla_Y \\nabla f, X)$ for any vector fields $X$ and $Y$.  You'll need to use the fact that $\\nabla f$ is a gradient field, but you won't need the fact that it has norm 1. Show that $g(\\nabla_{\\nabla f} \\nabla f, X) = 0$ for all $X$ by using 1. to write it as $g(\\nabla_X \\nabla f, \\nabla f)$ and expanding.  Here, you'll need to use the fact that $\\nabla f$ has norm 1.  Once you show this, conclude that $\\nabla_{\\nabla f} \\nabla f = 0$, i.e., that the integral curves are geodesics. Assuming I remember, or that you send a comment, I can update this in a few days with full solutions to either 1 or 2.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. So, the problem is about showing that the integral curves of the gradient of a function f on a Riemannian manifold are geodesics, given that the gradient has unit length everywhere. \n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic definitions. An integral curve of a vector field is a curve whose tangent vector at each point is equal to the vector field at that point. So, in this case, if grad f is the vector field, an integral curve γ(t) would satisfy γ'(t) = grad f at γ(t). \n\nNow, a geodesic is a curve whose acceleration (covariant derivative of the tangent vector) is zero. So, to show that γ is a geodesic, I need to show that the covariant derivative of γ' with respect to itself is zero, i.e., ∇_γ' γ' = 0.\n\nBut since γ' is grad f, this becomes ∇_{grad f} (grad f) = 0. Wait, is that necessarily true? Maybe not directly. Let me think. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the property that |grad f| = 1. If the gradient has constant length, maybe there's a relation involving the covariant derivative. I remember that for a vector field X with constant length, the covariant derivative of X in the direction of X might have some properties. Specifically, if |X| is constant, then the derivative of |X|² is zero, which gives 2⟨∇_X X, X⟩ = 0. But this only tells us that ∇_X X is orthogonal to X, not necessarily that it's zero. Hmm.\n\nWait, but in this case, X = grad f. Maybe there's more structure here because grad f is a gradient vector field. Gradient vector fields have the property that they are related to the differential of f. Let me recall that for any vector field Y, ⟨grad f, Y⟩ = Y(f). So maybe we can use some properties of the Levi-Civita connection here.\n\nAnother thought: Since grad f has unit length, let's compute ∇_{grad f} (grad f). Let's denote X = grad f. Then, we can use the compatibility of the Levi-Civita connection with the metric: for any vector fields X, Y, Z, we have X⟨Y, Z⟩ = ⟨∇_X Y, Z⟩ + ⟨Y, ∇_X Z⟩. Applying this with Y = Z = X, we get X⟨X, X⟩ = 2⟨∇_X X, X⟩. But ⟨X, X⟩ = |X|² = 1, so the left-hand side is X(1) = 0. Therefore, ⟨∇_X X, X⟩ = 0. So, ∇_X X is orthogonal to X. But we need to show that ∇_X X = 0.\n\nTo get more information, maybe use the fact that X is a gradient field. Let's recall that for a gradient vector field X = grad f, the covariant derivative ∇_Y X is related to the Hessian of f. Specifically, ∇_Y X = ∇_Y (grad f) = Hess f (Y), where Hess f is the Hessian tensor, which is symmetric. \n\nNow, if we take Y = X, then ∇_X X = Hess f (X). But since the Hessian is symmetric, maybe there's a property we can use here. Also, since X is grad f, we have that Hess f (X, Y) = ⟨∇_X grad f, Y⟩ = ⟨∇_Y grad f, X⟩ by symmetry of the Hessian. \n\nWait, maybe another approach. Since X = grad f, and |X| = 1, we can take the derivative in an arbitrary direction Y. Let's consider Y⟨X, X⟩ = 0, which gives 2⟨∇_Y X, X⟩ = 0 for any Y. So, ∇_Y X is orthogonal to X for any Y. \n\nBut we need to compute ∇_X X. Let's use the fact that X is a gradient. The Hessian of f is the symmetric (0,2) tensor defined by Hess f(Y, Z) = ⟨∇_Y grad f, Z⟩. Since the Hessian is symmetric, Hess f(Y, Z) = Hess f(Z, Y). Therefore, Hess f(X, X) = ⟨∇_X grad f, X⟩ = 0 from the earlier result. \n\nBut maybe we can relate ∇_X X to the Hessian. Since ∇_X X = ∇_X grad f = Hess f (X). Wait, that's a vector. So, ∇_X X is the vector obtained by contracting the Hessian with X. But since Hess f is symmetric, ∇_X X = Hess f (X) = ∇_{grad f} grad f. \n\nBut how does that help us? We need to show that ∇_X X = 0. Alternatively, maybe use the fact that X is the gradient of f, so the integral curves of X are curves that are parametrized such that they move along the direction of maximum increase of f. \n\nAnother idea: If γ is an integral curve of X, then along γ, f increases at a rate of 1, because d/dt (f ∘ γ) = ⟨grad f, γ’⟩ = ⟨X, X⟩ = 1. So, f(γ(t)) = t + constant. \n\nBut how does that help with showing γ is a geodesic? Let's suppose γ is a geodesic. Then, its acceleration is zero, i.e., ∇_{γ’} γ’ = 0. But γ’ = X, so we need ∇_X X = 0. \n\nBut earlier, we only established that ∇_X X is orthogonal to X. To show it's zero, maybe we need to show it's also orthogonal to all other directions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the fact that since X is a gradient, and the manifold is Riemannian, we can use some properties of Killing vector fields or something else. Wait, but gradient vector fields with constant length might have special properties. \n\nWait, suppose X is a vector field with constant length and its flow is a gradient flow. Then, maybe the integral curves are geodesics. Let me think. \n\nAlternatively, consider the connection. Let's take a parallel vector field along the integral curve. If the integral curve is a geodesic, then the tangent vector is parallel transported along itself. So, we need to show that ∇_X X = 0. \n\nBut how to connect this to the condition |X|=1. We know that for any vector field with constant length, the covariant derivative in the direction of the vector field is orthogonal to the vector field. But here, we need more. \n\nWait, maybe use the fact that X is a gradient field. For gradient fields, the covariant derivative ∇_Y X can be related to the Hessian. Specifically, ∇_Y X = ∇_Y (grad f) = Hess f (Y). Now, if we take Y = X, then ∇_X X = Hess f (X). \n\nBut Hess f (X) is a vector. Let's compute its inner product with an arbitrary vector Y. ⟨Hess f (X), Y⟩ = ⟨∇_X grad f, Y⟩ = Hess f (X, Y). But because the Hessian is symmetric, this is equal to Hess f (Y, X) = ⟨∇_Y grad f, X⟩. \n\nBut since |grad f|=1, as before, for any Y, ⟨∇_Y grad f, grad f⟩ = 0. In particular, if we take Y such that Y = grad f, then ⟨∇_grad f grad f, grad f⟩ = 0, which we already have. \n\nBut maybe we need to use the fact that the integral curves of X are paths where f increases at a constant rate. So, f(γ(t)) = t + C. Then, the derivative of f along γ is 1, and the second derivative would be zero. But the second derivative is Hess f (γ', γ') + something. Wait, the second derivative of f along γ is ⟨∇_{γ'} grad f, γ'⟩ = Hess f (γ', γ'). But since γ' = X, this is Hess f (X, X) = ⟨∇_X X, X⟩ = 0, which we already know. \n\nSo, the second derivative of f along γ is zero. But does that help us? Not directly. \n\nPerhaps another approach: Let's recall that a curve is a geodesic if and only if it's locally length-minimizing, but that might not be helpful here. Alternatively, use the geodesic equation. \n\nAlternatively, use the property that if a vector field is parallel along its own integral curves, then those curves are geodesics. Wait, that's exactly what we need. If ∇_X X = 0, then the integral curves are geodesics. \n\nSo, we need to show that ∇_X X = 0. Since X = grad f and |X| = 1, we have that ∇_X X is orthogonal to X. Now, to show that ∇_X X = 0, we need to show that it's also orthogonal to all vectors orthogonal to X. \n\nAlternatively, use coordinates. Let's pick a coordinate system around a point on the manifold. But maybe that complicates things. \n\nWait, here's an idea. Since X = grad f, we can use the fact that for any vector field Y, ⟨∇_Y X, Y⟩ = Hess f (Y, Y). If we can show that Hess f (Y, Y) = 0 for all Y orthogonal to X, then perhaps ∇_X X = 0. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's try another route. Suppose we take an orthonormal frame {e_1, ..., e_n} where e_1 = X. Then, since |X| =1, we can complete it to an orthonormal basis. Then, ∇_X X = sum_{i=1}^n ⟨∇_X X, e_i⟩ e_i. But we already know ⟨∇_X X, e_1⟩ = 0. So, we need to show that all other components are zero. \n\nFor i ≥2, ⟨∇_X X, e_i⟩ = ⟨∇_X grad f, e_i⟩ = Hess f (X, e_i). But by symmetry of the Hessian, this is equal to Hess f (e_i, X) = ⟨∇_{e_i} grad f, X⟩. But since X = grad f, this is ⟨∇_{e_i} X, X⟩. Which we know is zero because |X| is constant. So, ⟨∇_{e_i} X, X⟩ = 0. Hence, Hess f (X, e_i) = 0. Therefore, all components ⟨∇_X X, e_i⟩ = 0 for i ≥2. Hence, ∇_X X = 0. \n\nTherefore, ∇_X X = 0, which implies that the integral curves of X are geodesics. \n\nSo, putting it all together: Since X = grad f has constant length 1, the covariant derivative ∇_X X is orthogonal to X. But using the symmetry of the Hessian, we show that the other components also vanish, hence ∇_X X = 0, so the integral curves are geodesics.",
