    "Content": "This is a not mandatory exercise I am struggling with from my Analysis II Class, at the very end of it I am supposed to compute $$\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-t^2}dt \\tag{*}$$\nThe most famous way to do that is switch to polar coordinates but I am not supposed to do it that way, one of my tutors even called it a 'dirty trick'. Instead the exercise gives us the following two Integrals to work with: $$F(x)= \\int_0^1 \\frac{e^{-x^2(1+t^2)}}{1+t^2}dt \\text{ and } G(x)= \\left( \\int_0^x e^{-t^2}dt\\right)^2, \\ \\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R} $$ I yet fail to see how these two integrals relate to (*) but I can naively follow the instructions given by exercise sheet and hope that the result will follow: Problem : Show that $F,G$ are of Class $C^1(\\mathbb{R})$, compute $F',G'$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and show that $F+G$ is constant My approach : There isn't much to do really rather than to quote some Lemmas, clearly the parametric integral $F$ is of class $C^1$ because $f(x,t): \\mathbb{R} \\times [0,1] \\to \\mathbb{R}$ given by $f(x,t)=e^{-x^2(1+t^2)}/(1+t^2)$ is of class $C^1$, I can therefore switch the partial derivative with the integral and obtain that  $$F'(x) =-2 x \\int_0^1e^{-x^2(1+t^2)}dt$$ I doubt that I can further simplify this integral. With a little help of the fundamental theorem of Calculus one obtains that $$G'(x)= 2 \\left( \\int_0^x e^{-t^2}dt\\right)e^{-x^2} $$ At this point I hope that the exercise (or my computation) is flawed, at least the limit points of the integrals because I wouldn't know how to show that $F'+G'=0$ for all $x\\in \\mathbb{R}$ to conclude that $F+G$ is constant. The only sense I could make out of $F'$ would be if I integrated it with respect to $x$ rather to $t$. Are there any further simplifications I can do?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "$$F(x) = \\int_0^1 dt \\frac{e^{-x^2 (1+t^2)}}{1+t^2} \\implies F'(x) = -2 x e^{-x^2} \\int_0^1 dt \\, e^{-x^2 t^2} $$ $$G(x) = \\left ( \\int_0^x dt \\, e^{-t^2} \\right )^2 = x^2 \\left ( \\int_0^1 dt \\, e^{-x^2 t^2} \\right )^2 \\\\ \\implies G'(x) = 2 x \\left ( \\int_0^1 dt \\, e^{-x^2 t^2} \\right ) \\left [\\int_0^1 dt \\, e^{-x^2 t^2} - 2 x^2 \\int_0^1 dt \\,t^2  e^{-x^2 t^2} \\right ]$$ Then $$F'(x) + G'(x) = 2 x \\left ( \\int_0^1 dt \\, e^{-x^2 t^2} \\right )\\left [-e^{-x^2} + \\int_0^1 dt \\,(1-2 x^2 t^2)  e^{-x^2 t^2} \\right ] $$ Then note that $$(1-2 x^2 t^2)  e^{-x^2 t^2} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left ( t e^{-x^2 t^2} \\right )$$ and you'll find that $F'(x) + G'(x) = 0$ identically.  Thus $F(x) = G(x)$ equals a constant, say $F(0)+G(0)$, which is $$\\int_0^1 \\frac{dt}{1+t^2} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} $$ Now take the limit as $x \\to \\infty$, in which limit $F(x) \\to 0$ and thus $$\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\left ( \\int_0^x dt \\, e^{-t^2} \\right )^2 = \\left ( \\int_0^{\\infty} dt \\, e^{-t^2} \\right )^2 = \\frac{\\pi}{4} $$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. The original problem is about computing the integral of e^(-t²) from -infty to infty, but the exercise provided uses two functions F(x) and G(x). The task is to show they're C¹, compute their derivatives, and show F + G is constant.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem mentions F(x) and G(x) defined as:\n\nF(x) = integral from 0 to 1 of [e^{-x²(1+t²)}/(1+t²)] dt\n\nG(x) = (integral from 0 to x of e^{-t²} dt)²\n\nThe problem asks to show both are C¹(R), compute their derivatives, and show F + G is constant.\n\nSo, the assumptions would include the definitions of F and G, their domains, and the conditions required for them to be C¹. Let me list each assumption line by line.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- F(x) is defined as ∫₀¹ [e^{-x²(1+t²)}/(1+t²)] dt for all x in R.\n\n- G(x) is defined as (∫₀ˣ e^{-t²} dt)² for all x in R.\n\n- The function f(x,t) = e^{-x²(1+t²)}/(1+t²) is of class C¹ on R × [0,1].\n\n- The Leibniz rule applies to F(x) for differentiation under the integral sign.\n\n- The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus applies to G(x) for differentiation.\n\nEach of these addresses a single property or condition applied to one object. Then, the problem statement is to show F and G are C¹, compute their derivatives, and show F + G is constant.\n\nWait, the original problem's instructions are to \"Show that F,G are of Class C¹(R), compute F', G' for all x in R and show that F + G is constant.\" So the problem is exactly that. Therefore, the assumptions are the definitions of F and G, the conditions allowing differentiation under the integral sign for F, and the application of the Fundamental Theorem for G.\n\nBut the user's example shows that assumptions are listed as properties or conditions on the objects. So for F(x), the assumption is that the integrand is C¹, allowing differentiation under the integral sign. For G(x), the assumption is the applicability of the Fundamental Theorem. However, in the example given, the user included specific conditions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, perhaps the key assumptions are the definitions of F and G, and the smoothness conditions on their integrands.\n\nWait, the problem as given in the example for the divisibility problem includes assumptions on n. Here, perhaps the key assumptions are:\n\n- F is defined as the integral from 0 to 1 of [e^{-x²(1+t²)}/(1+t²)] dt.\n\n- G is defined as the square of the integral from 0 to x of e^{-t²} dt.\n\n- The integrand of F is of class C¹ on R × [0,1].\n\n- The integrand of G (which is e^{-t²}) is continuous, hence the integral is differentiable.\n\nBut each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. So breaking down:\n\nAssumption 1: F(x) = ∫₀¹ [e^{-x²(1+t²)}/(1+t²)] dt for all x ∈ R.\n\nAssumption 2: G(x) = (∫₀ˣ e^{-t²} dt)² for all x ∈ R.\n\nAssumption 3: The function f(x,t) = e^{-x²(1+t²)}/(1+t²) is of class C¹ on R × [0,1].\n\nAssumption 4: The function e^{-t²} is continuous on R.\n\nEach of these is a separate condition. The third assumption allows differentiation under the integral sign for F(x), and the fourth ensures that G(x) is differentiable via the Fundamental Theorem.\n\nSo putting it all together, the formatted problem should have these assumptions and then the problem statement as given.\n\nLet me check the example again. In the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted assumptions were that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the example? Let me check.\n\nOriginal problem in the example: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted assumptions are: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that would imply that the problem is for integers divisible by 7, but the original problem says for every integer n. That seems like an error in the example. Maybe the example is hypothetical, or the original problem had a typo. But perhaps in the example, the user intended to have an additional condition. However, the user provided that as an example, so perhaps we should follow that structure.\n\nBut in our current problem, the problem doesn't have any hidden conditions beyond the definitions of F and G and their differentiability. So perhaps the assumptions here are:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- F(x) is defined as ∫₀¹ [e^{-x²(1+t²)}/(1+t²)] dt for all real x.\n\n- G(x) is defined as (∫₀ˣ e^{-t²} dt)² for all real x.\n\n- The integrand of F, f(x,t) = e^{-x²(1+t²)}/(1+t²), is of class C¹ on R × [0,1].\n\n- The integrand e^{-t²} is continuous on R.\n\nEach of these is a single assumption applied to one object. Then the problem is to show F and G are C¹, compute their derivatives, and show F + G is constant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third assumption is the differentiability condition for F, and the fourth is the differentiability condition for G. But in the problem statement, showing they are C¹ is part of the task. Wait, but in the example, the assumption included a condition (n divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, the original problem in the example was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Maybe the example was misrepresented. But assuming that the user's example is correct, perhaps the assumptions are the given conditions in the problem, even if they are part of the problem statement.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"All the assumptions of the problem should be listed line by line. Each assumption addresses only one property or condition, applied to one object\". So in the original problem, the user included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, even though the original problem says \"for every integer n\". So maybe in the example, there was a mistake, but the user intended to have the problem as given.\n\nBut in our current case, the problem states that F and G are defined as those integrals, and the exercise wants to show they are C¹, compute derivatives, etc. So the assumptions would be the definitions of F and G, and any conditions given in the problem. The problem mentions \"for all x in R\", so maybe that's part of the assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem's assumptions are the definitions of F and G. So:\n\nAssumption 1: F(x) = ∫₀¹ [e^{-x²(1+t²)}/(1+t²)] dt for all x ∈ R.\n\nAssumption 2: G(x) = (∫₀ˣ e^{-t²} dt)² for all x ∈ R.\n\nThese are the main assumptions. Then the problem is to show they're C¹, compute derivatives, and show F + G is constant.\n\nBut the example included an additional assumption about divisibility by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, in the original example, the problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake, but maybe the example was altered. However, since the user provided that example, perhaps we need to follow that style.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example was for a different problem where the user mistyped, but given that, I need to proceed with the current problem.\n\nSo, to follow the user's example structure, the assumptions should list all conditions given in the problem. The problem here defines F and G as above, so the assumptions are:\n\n- F(x) is defined as ∫₀¹ [e^{-x²(1+t²)}/(1+t²)] dt for all x ∈ R.\n\n- G(x) is defined as (∫₀ˣ e^{-t²} dt)² for all x ∈ R.\n\n- The integrand of F is of class C¹ on R × [0,1].\n\n- The integrand of G's integral (e^{-t²}) is continuous.\n\nBut maybe the user's example only lists the objects and their properties. For instance, in the example, the assumptions were about n: being an integer and divisible by 7. So here, the assumptions would be about F and G.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions are the given definitions and the problem's conditions. For example:\n\nAssumption:\n\nF(x) is defined as the integral from 0 to 1 of [e^{-x²(1+t²)}/(1+t²)] dt.\n\nG(x) is defined as the square of the integral from 0 to x of e^{-t²} dt.\n\nThe integrand of F is C¹ on R × [0,1].\n\nThe integrand e^{-t²} is continuous.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. But I need to check if each addresses only one property applied to one object.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption 1: F(x) = ∫₀¹ [e^{-x²(1+t²)}/(1+t²)] dt for all real x.\n\nAssumption 2: G(x) = (∫₀ˣ e^{-t²} dt)² for all real x.\n\nAssumption 3: The function f(x,t) = e^{-x²(1+t²)}/(1+t²) is of class C¹ on R × [0,1].\n\nAssumption 4: The function e^{-t²} is continuous on R.\n\nThis way, each assumption is about one object (F, G, f, e^{-t²}) and one property.\n\nThen the problem is to show F and G are C¹, compute derivatives, and show F + G is constant.\n\nYes, this seems to fit the example's structure, even though the example had a mistake. Following this, the formatted problem would be as above.",
