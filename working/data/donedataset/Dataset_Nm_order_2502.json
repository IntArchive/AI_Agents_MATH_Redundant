    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to show that the integral from 0 to 1 of arctan(x) divided by the square root of x times (1 minus x) dx equals pi times arctan of the square root of (sqrt(2) minus 1)/2. Hmm, that seems pretty complex. Let me start by understanding the components of the integral.\n\nFirst, the integrand is arctan(x) over sqrt(x(1 - x)). The denominator sqrt(x(1 - x)) reminds me of the Beta function integral, which involves x^(a-1)(1 - x)^(b-1) dx from 0 to 1. But here, instead of polynomial terms, we have arctan(x). Maybe integration techniques related to Beta or Gamma functions could be useful here? Or perhaps substitution?\n\nThe user mentioned they tried the substitution x = (1 - t)/(1 + t), but it didn't help much. Let me think why that substitution might be used. Sometimes, substitutions like that can rationalize certain terms or simplify the integral's limits. Let's try plugging in x = (1 - t)/(1 + t). Then, when x = 0, t = 1; when x = 1, t = 0. So the limits would switch, which might complicate things. Let's compute dx: dx/dt would be [-(1 + t) - (1 - t)]/(1 + t)^2) = (-2)/(1 + t)^2. Then sqrt(x(1 - x)) would be sqrt([(1 - t)/(1 + t)] * [1 - (1 - t)/(1 + t)]) = sqrt([(1 - t)/(1 + t)] * [2t/(1 + t)]) = sqrt(2t(1 - t))/(1 + t). So the denominator becomes sqrt(2t(1 - t))/(1 + t). The integrand would then be arctan[(1 - t)/(1 + t)] times (1 + t)/sqrt(2t(1 - t)) times dx/dt, which was -2/(1 + t)^2. Putting it all together, the integral becomes from t=1 to t=0, which flips the limits and removes the negative sign. So the integral is 2/sqrt(2) times integral from 0 to 1 of arctan[(1 - t)/(1 + t)] / sqrt(t(1 - t)) * 1/(1 + t) dt. Simplify 2/sqrt(2) to sqrt(2). Then, arctan[(1 - t)/(1 + t)] is arctan(1) - arctan(t) because arctan(a) - arctan(b) = arctan[(a - b)/(1 + ab)]. Wait, actually, (1 - t)/(1 + t) can be written as [1 - t]/[1 + t], which is similar to the formula for arctan(a) - arctan(b). Let me check: arctan((a - b)/(1 + ab)) = arctan(a) - arctan(b) if ab > -1. So if we set a = 1 and b = t, then (1 - t)/(1 + t) = (a - b)/(1 + ab), so arctan[(1 - t)/(1 + t)] = arctan(1) - arctan(t) = π/4 - arctan(t). Therefore, the integrand becomes [π/4 - arctan(t)] / sqrt(t(1 - t)) * 1/(1 + t). Hmm, not sure if this helps. The 1/(1 + t) complicates things. Maybe this substitution isn't the right path.\n\nAnother thought: since the integral is from 0 to 1, and the denominator is sqrt(x(1 - x)), perhaps a trigonometric substitution? Let me try x = sin^2(theta). Then, dx = 2 sin(theta) cos(theta) d(theta). The denominator becomes sqrt(sin^2(theta) * (1 - sin^2(theta))) = sqrt(sin^2(theta) cos^2(theta)) = sin(theta) cos(theta). So the integral becomes arctan(sin^2(theta)) divided by sin(theta) cos(theta)) times 2 sin(theta) cos(theta) d(theta). That simplifies to 2 arctan(sin^2(theta)) d(theta) from theta=0 to theta=pi/2. Hmm, not sure if that helps. Arctan(sin^2(theta)) is still a complicated function.\n\nWait, maybe differentiation under the integral sign? Let's consider introducing a parameter. Let me define I(a) = integral from 0 to1 of arctan(a x)/sqrt(x(1 - x)) dx. Then, differentiate I(a) with respect to a. The derivative I’(a) would be integral from 0 to1 of [x / (1 + (a x)^2)] / sqrt(x(1 - x)) dx. That might be easier to handle. Then integrate with respect to a to find I(1) - I(0). Since arctan(0) = 0, I(0) = 0. So if we can compute I’(a) and integrate from a=0 to 1, we can get the desired integral.\n\nLet me compute I’(a). So it's integral from 0 to1 of x / (1 + a²x²) / sqrt(x(1 - x)) dx. Let me simplify the integrand: x / sqrt(x(1 - x)) = sqrt(x)/sqrt(1 - x). So I’(a) = integral from 0 to1 sqrt(x)/sqrt(1 - x) * 1/(1 + a²x²) dx. Hmm, not sure if that's better. Maybe substitution t = sqrt(x/(1 - x)). Let t = sqrt(x/(1 - x)) => t² = x/(1 - x) => x = t²/(1 + t²) => dx = [2t(1 + t²) - t²*2t]/(1 + t²)^2 dt = [2t + 2t³ - 2t³]/(1 + t²)^2 dt = 2t/(1 + t²)^2 dt. Then, sqrt(x)/sqrt(1 - x) = t. So the integral becomes t * [1/(1 + a²*(t²/(1 + t²))²)] * 2t/(1 + t²)^2 dt from t=0 to t=∞. Wait, that seems complicated. Let me check:\n\nOriginal substitution: x = t²/(1 + t²), so 1 - x = 1/(1 + t²). Then, 1 + a²x² = 1 + a²(t^4)/(1 + t²)^2. So denominator becomes [ (1 + t²)^2 + a² t^4 ] / (1 + t²)^2. So reciprocal is (1 + t²)^2 / [ (1 + t²)^2 + a² t^4 ]. Thus, the integrand for I’(a) becomes t * (1 + t²)^2 / [ (1 + t²)^2 + a² t^4 ] * 2t/(1 + t²)^2 dt. Simplify: t * 2t / [ (1 + t²)^2 + a² t^4 ] dt. That's 2t² / [ (1 + t²)^2 + a² t^4 ] dt. Let's expand the denominator: (1 + t²)^2 = 1 + 2t² + t^4. So denominator becomes 1 + 2t² + t^4 + a² t^4 = 1 + 2t² + t^4(1 + a²). Hmm, not obvious. Maybe factor?\n\nAlternatively, write denominator as t^4(1 + a²) + 2t² + 1. Let me see if it's a quadratic in t²: Let u = t², then denominator is (1 + a²) u² + 2u + 1. The discriminant would be 4 - 4*(1 + a²)*1 = 4 - 4 - 4a² = -4a². So roots are complex. Not helpful.\n\nPerhaps partial fractions? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe another substitution. Let me think. Maybe hyperbolic substitution? Let t = sinh(y), but not sure. Alternatively, express the denominator as t^4(1 + a²) + 2t² + 1. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, think of the integral as 2 ∫ t² / [ (1 + a²) t^4 + 2 t² + 1 ] dt from 0 to ∞. Let me check if the denominator can be written as a quadratic in t²: (1 + a²) t^4 + 2 t² + 1. Let me set u = t², then denominator is (1 + a²) u² + 2u + 1. Let's see if this factors. The discriminant is 4 - 4*(1 + a²)*1 = 4 - 4 - 4a² = -4a². So no real roots. Therefore, it doesn't factor into real quadratics. So integrating 2u / [ (1 + a²) u² + 2u + 1 ] du from u=0 to ∞. Hmm. Perhaps substitution z = u + something. Alternatively, complete the square in the denominator.\n\nDenominator: (1 + a²)u² + 2u + 1. Let's factor out (1 + a²):\n\n(1 + a²)(u² + [2/(1 + a²)] u) + 1. Complete the square inside the brackets:\n\nu² + [2/(1 + a²)] u = [u + 1/(1 + a²)]² - 1/(1 + a²)^2. Therefore, denominator becomes:\n\n(1 + a²)[ (u + 1/(1 + a²))² - 1/(1 + a²)^2 ] + 1\n\n= (1 + a²)(u + 1/(1 + a²))² - (1 + a²)*1/(1 + a²)^2 + 1\n\n= (1 + a²)(u + 1/(1 + a²))² - 1/(1 + a²) + 1\n\n= (1 + a²)(u + 1/(1 + a²))² + (1 - 1/(1 + a²))\n\n= (1 + a²)(u + 1/(1 + a²))² + (a²)/(1 + a²)\n\nHmm, not sure if this helps. Maybe this is too complicated. Maybe another approach.\n\nWait, going back to the original integral: ∫₀¹ arctan(x)/sqrt(x(1 - x)) dx. Perhaps integration by parts? Let u = arctan(x), dv = dx/sqrt(x(1 - x)). Then, du = 1/(1 + x²) dx, and v = the integral of dv. But integrating dv = 1/sqrt(x(1 - x)) dx is standard. Let me compute v: ∫1/sqrt(x(1 - x)) dx. Let x = sin²θ, then dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ. The integral becomes ∫ 2 sinθ cosθ / (sinθ cosθ) dθ = ∫ 2 dθ = 2θ + C = 2 arcsin(sqrt(x)) + C. So v = 2 arcsin(sqrt(x)). Therefore, integration by parts gives:\n\nuv |₀¹ - ∫₀¹ v du = [arctan(1) * 2 arcsin(1) - arctan(0) * 2 arcsin(0)] - ∫₀¹ 2 arcsin(sqrt(x)) / (1 + x²) dx.\n\narctan(1) is π/4, arcsin(1) is π/2, so first term is π/4 * 2*(π/2) = π²/4. The second term is 0. So the integral becomes π²/4 - 2 ∫₀¹ arcsin(sqrt(x)) / (1 + x²) dx. Hmm, but now we have an integral involving arcsin(sqrt(x)), which might not be easier than the original. Maybe another substitution here? Let t = sqrt(x), so x = t², dx = 2t dt. The integral becomes 2 ∫₀¹ arcsin(t) / (1 + t⁴) * t dt. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the substitution x = t² in the original integral. Let x = t², then dx = 2t dt. The integral becomes ∫₀¹ arctan(t²) / sqrt(t²(1 - t²)) * 2t dt = 2 ∫₀¹ arctan(t²) / (t sqrt(1 - t²)) * t dt = 2 ∫₀¹ arctan(t²) / sqrt(1 - t²) dt. Not sure if this helps.\n\nWait, another idea: express arctan(x) as an integral itself. arctan(x) = ∫₀^x 1/(1 + y²) dy. So maybe swap the order of integration. Let me try:\n\nOriginal integral is ∫₀¹ [∫₀^x 1/(1 + y²) dy] / sqrt(x(1 - x)) dx. Switching the order of integration: For y from 0 to 1, and x from y to 1. So the integral becomes ∫₀¹ [∫_y¹ 1/sqrt(x(1 - x)) dx] / (1 + y²) dy. Compute the inner integral ∫_y¹ 1/sqrt(x(1 - x)) dx. Let me make substitution x = sin²θ as before. Then, the integral from x=y to x=1 becomes ∫_{arcsin(sqrt(y))}^{π/2} 2 dθ = 2*(π/2 - arcsin(sqrt(y))) = π - 2 arcsin(sqrt(y)). So the integral becomes ∫₀¹ [π - 2 arcsin(sqrt(y))] / (1 + y²) dy. Split into two integrals: π ∫₀¹ 1/(1 + y²) dy - 2 ∫₀¹ arcsin(sqrt(y))/(1 + y²) dy. The first integral is π [arctan(y)]₀¹ = π*(π/4 - 0) = π²/4. The second integral is 2 times the same integral as before, which came from integration by parts. Wait, so we have:\n\nOriginal integral = π²/4 - 2 ∫₀¹ arcsin(sqrt(y))/(1 + y²) dy.\n\nBut when we switched the order of integration, we arrived at the same expression. This seems circular. So this approach might not help.\n\nPerhaps another substitution. Let me try x = (t - 1)/(t + 1). Wait, similar to the original substitution. But maybe use substitution related to hypergeometric functions? Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, the answer is π arctan(sqrt{(sqrt(2) - 1)/2}). Let me compute sqrt{(sqrt(2) - 1)/2}. Let’s see: sqrt{(sqrt(2) - 1)/2} ≈ sqrt{(1.4142 - 1)/2} ≈ sqrt{0.4142/2} ≈ sqrt(0.2071) ≈ 0.4551. Then arctan(0.4551) ≈ 0.43 radians. Multiply by π ≈ 1.35. The integral is supposed to be around that. Not sure if numerical computation helps here.\n\nWait, maybe the integral can be related to some known constants or known integrals. The presence of arctan suggests that maybe the integral involves a combination of logarithmic terms or angles. Alternatively, consider using complex analysis? But that might be overkill.\n\nAlternatively, consider representing the integrand as a derivative. Let me think. The denominator sqrt(x(1 - x)) is similar to the density function of a Beta distribution. If I recall, the integral of x^{c-1}(1 - x)^{d-1} from 0 to1 is Beta(c, d). But here we have arctan(x) times x^{-1/2}(1 - x)^{-1/2}. Maybe expanding arctan(x) as a power series and integrating term by term?\n\nThe user mentioned trying a series expansion for arctan(x) but doubted it would help because the result has an arctan. But perhaps it's worth trying. Let's recall that arctan(x) = sum_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n x^{2n+1}/(2n +1) for |x| ≤1. Since x is from 0 to1, this is valid. So the integral becomes sum_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n/(2n +1) ∫₀¹ x^{2n +1} / sqrt(x(1 - x)) dx. Simplify the integrand: x^{2n +1}/sqrt(x) = x^{2n + 1 - 1/2} = x^{2n + 1/2}. So the integral becomes sum_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n/(2n +1) ∫₀¹ x^{2n + 1/2} (1 - x)^{-1/2} dx. That integral is the Beta function B(2n + 3/2, 1/2) = Γ(2n + 3/2)Γ(1/2)/Γ(2n + 2). We know Γ(1/2) = sqrt(π), and Γ(2n + 3/2) can be expressed in terms of factorials or double factorials. Let's see:\n\nΓ(2n + 3/2) = (2n + 1/2) Γ(2n + 1/2). Wait, but maybe using the duplication formula. Alternatively, write Γ(2n + 3/2) = (2n + 1/2)(2n - 1/2)...(1/2) sqrt(π). Alternatively, express in terms of factorials:\n\nΓ(m + 1/2) = (2m)!/(4^m m!) sqrt(π). So for m = 2n + 1:\n\nWait, no. Let me check. For integer m, Γ(m + 1/2) = (2m)! sqrt(π))/(4^m m!). So if we set m = 2n + 1, then Γ(2n + 1 + 1/2) = Γ(2n + 3/2) = (2(2n +1))! sqrt(π))/(4^{2n +1} (2n +1)!)). Hmm, complicated. Alternatively, maybe express Beta(2n + 3/2, 1/2) as the integral result.\n\nBut Beta(a, b) = 2 ∫₀^{π/2} (sinθ)^{2a -1} (cosθ)^{2b -1} dθ. For a = 2n + 3/2, b = 1/2. Then, Beta(2n + 3/2, 1/2) = 2 ∫₀^{π/2} (sinθ)^{4n +2} (cosθ)^{0} dθ = 2 ∫₀^{π/2} sin^{4n +2}θ dθ. Which can be expressed in terms of the Beta function again. Not sure if this helps.\n\nAlternatively, we can write Beta(2n + 3/2, 1/2) = sqrt(π) Γ(2n + 3/2)/Γ(2n + 2). Now, Γ(2n + 2) = (2n +1)! So we have Beta(2n + 3/2, 1/2) = sqrt(π) * Γ(2n + 3/2)/( (2n +1)! ). Hmm. Then the integral becomes sum_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n/(2n +1) * sqrt(π) Γ(2n + 3/2)/( (2n +1)! ). Not sure if this series can be summed up to get the desired result. Seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe recognize that the original integral is related to some known transform or identity involving arctan and Beta functions. Alternatively, consider differentiating under the integral sign with respect to a parameter.\n\nWait, let's return to the substitution x = sin^2θ. Then the integral becomes ∫₀^{π/2} arctan(sin²θ) / (sinθ cosθ) * 2 sinθ cosθ dθ = 2 ∫₀^{π/2} arctan(sin²θ) dθ. So the original integral is 2 ∫₀^{π/2} arctan(sin²θ) dθ. Hmm, maybe express arctan(sin²θ) as an integral: arctan(z) = ∫₀^z 1/(1 + t²) dt. So 2 ∫₀^{π/2} [∫₀^{sin²θ} 1/(1 + t²) dt] dθ. Switch the order of integration: For t from 0 to 1 (since sin²θ ≤1), and θ from arcsin(sqrt(t)) to π/2. So the integral becomes 2 ∫₀¹ [∫_{arcsin(sqrt(t))}^{π/2} dθ ] / (1 + t²) dt. The inner integral is π/2 - arcsin(sqrt(t)). So we have 2 ∫₀¹ (π/2 - arcsin(sqrt(t)) / (1 + t²) dt. Which is the same as π ∫₀¹ 1/(1 + t²) dt - 2 ∫₀¹ arcsin(sqrt(t))/(1 + t²) dt. Which brings us back to the previous expression. So again, circular.\n\nAlternatively, think of the integral as a double integral and change variables. Alternatively, consider polar coordinates. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe use Fourier series or expansion in terms of orthogonal functions. Hmm, maybe overcomplicating.\n\nAnother idea: Let’s consider substitution y = sqrt(x(1 - x)). But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider the integral from 0 to1 of arctan(x)/sqrt(x(1 - x)) dx. Let me split the integral into two parts: from 0 to 1/2 and 1/2 to1. Maybe symmetry? Not obvious. Or substitution x =1 - t in the second part. Then, the integral from 1/2 to1 becomes ∫₀^{1/2} arctan(1 - t)/sqrt(t(1 - t)) dt. Not sure if that helps.\n\nWait, maybe consider combining the integral with its substitution x = (1 - t)/(1 + t) as the user tried. Earlier steps led to sqrt(2) ∫₀¹ [π/4 - arctan(t)] / sqrt(t(1 - t)) * 1/(1 + t) dt. So the original integral I = sqrt(2) [π/4 ∫₀¹ 1/(sqrt(t(1 - t))(1 + t) dt - ∫₀¹ arctan(t)/(sqrt(t(1 - t))(1 + t) dt]. Let me denote the first integral as J and the second as K. So I = sqrt(2) (π/4 J - K). If we can compute J and K, perhaps we can find I.\n\nCompute J = ∫₀¹ 1/(sqrt(t(1 - t))(1 + t) dt. Let me substitute t = sin²θ. Then, J = ∫₀^{π/2} 1/(sinθ cosθ) * 2 sinθ cosθ dθ / (1 + sin²θ) = 2 ∫₀^{π/2} dθ / (1 + sin²θ). The integral ∫ dθ/(1 + sin²θ) can be evaluated using substitution. Let me recall that ∫ dθ/(a + b sin²θ) = [1/sqrt(a(a + b))] arctan( sqrt(a/(a + b)) tanθ ) + C. For our case, a=1, b=1. So ∫ dθ/(1 + sin²θ) = [1/sqrt(1*2)] arctan( sqrt(1/2) tanθ ) + C. Therefore, J = 2 [1/sqrt(2)} arctan( tanθ / sqrt(2) ) ] from 0 to π/2. At θ=π/2, tanθ approaches infinity, so arctan(infinity/sqrt(2)) = π/2. At θ=0, it's 0. Therefore, J = 2/sqrt(2) * (π/2 - 0) = sqrt(2) * π/2 = π/sqrt(2). So J = π/sqrt(2).\n\nNow compute K = ∫₀¹ arctan(t)/(sqrt(t(1 - t))(1 + t) dt. Hmm, this seems more challenging. Maybe substitution u = sqrt(t/(1 - t)). Let u = sqrt(t/(1 - t)), so t = u²/(1 + u²), dt = [2u(1 + u²) - u²*2u]/(1 + u²)^2 du = [2u + 2u³ - 2u³]/(1 + u²)^2 du = 2u/(1 + u²)^2 du. Then, sqrt(t(1 - t)) = sqrt(u²/(1 + u²) * 1/(1 + u²)) = u/(1 + u²). So the integrand becomes arctan(u²/(1 + u²)) / (u/(1 + u²)) * 1/(1 + u²/(1 + u²)) * 2u/(1 + u²)^2 du. Wait, this seems messy. Let me compute each part:\n\narctan(t) = arctan(u²/(1 + u²)).\n\nDenominator: sqrt(t(1 - t)) (1 + t) = [u/(1 + u²)] * [1 + u²/(1 + u²)] = [u/(1 + u²)] * [(1 + u²) + u²)/(1 + u²))] = [u/(1 + u²)] * [ (1 + 2u²)/(1 + u²) ) ] = u(1 + 2u²)/(1 + u²)^2.\n\nThus, K = ∫₀^infty [arctan(u²/(1 + u²))] / [ u(1 + 2u²)/(1 + u²)^2 ) ] * 2u/(1 + u²)^2 du.\n\nSimplify: [arctan(...)] * (1 + u²)^2 / [ u(1 + 2u²) ] * 2u/(1 + u²)^2 du.\n\nThe u cancels, (1 + u²)^2 cancels with denominator, so we have 2 ∫₀^infty arctan(u²/(1 + u²)) / (1 + 2u²) du.\n\nSimplify the argument of arctan: u²/(1 + u²) = 1 - 1/(1 + u²). So arctan(1 - 1/(1 + u²)). Not sure if helpful. Alternatively, note that u²/(1 + u²) = tanφ, where phi is some angle. Maybe use a trigonometric identity.\n\nAlternatively, let’s make substitution v = u sqrt(2), so u = v/sqrt(2), du = dv/sqrt(2). Then, 1 + 2u² = 1 + v². The integral becomes 2 ∫₀^infty arctan( (v²/2)/(1 + v²/2) ) / (1 + v²) * dv/sqrt(2). Simplify the argument inside arctan: (v²/2)/(1 + v²/2) = v²/(2 + v²). So K = 2/sqrt(2) ∫₀^infty arctan(v²/(2 + v²)) / (1 + v²) dv = sqrt(2) ∫₀^infty arctan(v²/(2 + v²)) / (1 + v²) dv. Hmm, still complicated.\n\nAlternatively, note that arctan(v²/(2 + v²)) can be expressed as arctan(v²/(2 + v²)) = arctan( (v² + 2 - 2)/(2 + v²) ) = arctan(1 - 2/(2 + v²)). Not sure. Alternatively, let’s set w = v². Then, dv = dw/(2 sqrt(w)). The integral becomes sqrt(2) ∫₀^infty arctan(w/(2 + w)) / (1 + w) * dw/(2 sqrt(w)) ). Hmm, still not helpful.\n\nPerhaps another substitution for K. Let’s consider t = u²/(1 + u²). Then, u = sqrt(t/(1 - t)), du = [ (1/(2 sqrt(t/(1 - t))) * ( (1 - t) + t ) / (1 - t)^2 ) ] dt. Wait, this might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps differentiation under the integral sign for K. Let’s define K(a) = ∫₀¹ arctan(a t)/(sqrt(t(1 - t))(1 + t) dt. Then, K’(a) = ∫₀¹ t / (1 + a² t²) / sqrt(t(1 - t)) / (1 + t) dt. Which is ∫₀¹ sqrt(t)/(1 + a² t²) / sqrt(1 - t) / (1 + t) dt. This seems even more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express 1/(1 + t) as a integral. For example, 1/(1 + t) = ∫₀^infty e^{-(1 + t)s} ds. Then, K = ∫₀¹ arctan(t)/sqrt(t(1 - t)) ∫₀^infty e^{-(1 + t)s} ds dt = ∫₀^infty e^{-s} ∫₀¹ arctan(t) e^{-s t} / sqrt(t(1 - t)) dt ds. But this seems to lead to a more complicated double integral.\n\nAt this point, it's clear that direct integration methods are not straightforward. Perhaps we need to relate the integral to some known result or use a clever substitution that exploits symmetry.\n\nWait, the answer involves arctan(sqrt{(sqrt(2)-1)/2}). Let me compute sqrt{(sqrt(2)-1)/2}:\n\nLet’s denote A = sqrt{(sqrt(2)-1)/2}. Then A^2 = (sqrt(2) -1)/2. Let’s compute tan(π/8): tan(π/8) = sqrt(2) -1 ≈ 0.4142. Which is equal to sqrt(2) -1. So A^2 = tan(π/8)/2. So A = sqrt(tan(π/8)/2). Let’s compute tan(π/16): tan(π/16) is sqrt( (1 - cos(π/8))/ (1 + cos(π/8)) ). But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, notice that (sqrt(2)-1)/2 is (sqrt(2)/2 -1/2) ≈ 0.7071 -0.5=0.2071, and sqrt(0.2071)≈0.455. Which is tan(π/8 - π/16)? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the argument of the arctan in the result is tan(π/8), which is sqrt(2)-1≈0.4142, but sqrt{(sqrt(2)-1)/2} is sqrt(0.2071)=0.4551≈tan(π/8) perhaps? Wait, tan(π/8)=sqrt(2)-1≈0.4142, which is less than 0.4551. Hmm, not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the result is π times arctan of that expression. If we can express the integral as π times some angle, maybe there is a geometric interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, consider contour integration. Let me try to consider a complex integral. But since the integral is from 0 to1, perhaps substitution to relate it to a contour that circles around singularities. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Let’s recall that 91 = 7*13, but not sure if that's relevant here. Wait, no, the example given by the user was about divisibility by 91, but the current problem is different.\n\nWait, going back to the substitution x = sin^2θ, the integral becomes 2 ∫₀^{π/2} arctan(sin²θ) dθ. Maybe express sin²θ in terms of double angles: sin²θ = (1 - cos2θ)/2. So arctan(sin²θ) = arctan( (1 - cos2θ)/2 ). Let me set φ = 2θ, then dθ = dφ/2, and the integral becomes 2 ∫₀^π arctan( (1 - cosφ)/2 ) * dφ/2 = ∫₀^π arctan( (1 - cosφ)/2 ) dφ. The integral over φ from 0 to π of arctan( (1 - cosφ)/2 ) dφ. Perhaps this can be evaluated using known techniques or symmetries.\n\nNote that (1 - cosφ)/2 = sin²(φ/2). So the integral becomes ∫₀^π arctan(sin²(φ/2)) dφ. Let’s make substitution ψ = φ/2, then dφ = 2dψ, and integral becomes 2 ∫₀^{π/2} arctan(sin²ψ) dψ. Wait, this brings us back to the original substitution. So no progress.\n\nAlternatively, consider expanding arctan(sin²ψ) into a power series. As before, but leads to the same complications.\n\nAlternatively, differentiate the integral with respect to a parameter. Let’s consider I(a) = ∫₀^π arctan(a(1 - cosφ)/2) dφ. Then I’(a) = ∫₀^π [ (1 - cosφ)/2 ] / [1 + (a^2 (1 - cosφ)^2)/4 ] dφ. Simplify: I’(a) = ∫₀^π (1 - cosφ) / [2 + (a² (1 - cosφ)^2 / 2 ] dφ. Not sure.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to look for a clever substitution or identity that relates the integral to an expression involving arctan of a specific value. The presence of sqrt(2) in the result suggests that the integral might involve a substitution that introduces sqrt(2) in some symmetric fashion.\n\nWait, another idea: Let’s consider the substitution x = (y^2 -1)/(y^2 +1). Wait, this maps y from 1 to infinity to x from 0 to1. Let me try:\n\nLet x = (y² -1)/(y² +1), so y = sqrt( (1 + x)/(1 - x) ). Then dx/dy = [2y(y² +1) - (y² -1)2y ] / (y² +1)^2 = [2y(y² +1 - y² +1)] / (y² +1)^2 = 4y/(y² +1)^2. The denominator sqrt(x(1 -x)) becomes sqrt( (y² -1)/(y² +1) * (2)/(y² +1) ) = sqrt( 2(y² -1) ) / (y² +1). So the integrand arctan(x)/sqrt(x(1 -x)) becomes arctan( (y² -1)/(y² +1) ) * (y² +1)/sqrt(2(y² -1)) ). Multiply by dx/dy =4y/(y² +1)^2. So the integral becomes ∫₁^infty [arctan( (y² -1)/(y² +1) ) * (y² +1)/sqrt(2(y² -1)) ] * [4y/(y² +1)^2] dy. Simplify: 4/sqrt(2) ∫₁^infty arctan( (y² -1)/(y² +1) ) * y / ( (y² +1) sqrt(y² -1) ) dy. Simplify further: 2 sqrt(2) ∫₁^infty arctan( (y² -1)/(y² +1) ) * y / ( (y² +1) sqrt(y² -1) ) dy.\n\nNote that (y² -1)/(y² +1) = 1 - 2/(y² +1). So arctan(1 - 2/(y² +1)). Not sure. Alternatively, note that for y >1, (y² -1)/(y² +1) = tanh(α) for some α? Maybe hyperbolic substitution.\n\nLet’s set y = cosh t, then sqrt(y² -1) = sinh t, dy = sinh t dt. Then, the integral becomes 2 sqrt(2) ∫₀^infty arctan( (cosh² t -1)/(cosh² t +1) ) * cosh t / ( (cosh² t +1) sinh t ) * sinh t dt. Simplify denominator: (cosh² t +1) = 2 cosh² t - sinh² t +1. Wait, cosh² t +1 = 2 cosh² t - sinh² t +1. Not sure. Let me compute (cosh² t -1)/(cosh² t +1) = sinh² t / (cosh² t +1). Since cosh² t +1 = 2 cosh² t - sinh² t +1? Wait, cosh² t = sinh² t +1, so cosh² t +1 = sinh² t +2. Therefore, sinh² t / (sinh² t +2). So arctan( sinh² t / (sinh² t +2) ). Hmm.\n\nThe integral becomes 2 sqrt(2) ∫₀^infty arctan( sinh² t / (sinh² t +2) ) * cosh t / (cosh² t +1) dt. Still complicated.\n\nPerhaps another substitution. Let’s set z = sinh t. Then, dz = cosh t dt. When t=0, z=0; t=∞, z=∞. The integral becomes 2 sqrt(2) ∫₀^infty arctan( z²/(z² +2) ) / ( (z² +1 +1) ) dz. Which is 2 sqrt(2) ∫₀^infty arctan( z²/(z² +2) ) / (z² +2) dz. Hmm, not helpful.\n\nAt this point, I think I might need to look for a different approach entirely. Let me consider the original integral:\n\nI = ∫₀¹ arctan(x)/sqrt(x(1 - x)) dx.\n\nLet’s consider the substitution t = sqrt(x/(1 - x)). Then, x = t²/(1 + t²), 1 - x =1/(1 + t²), dx = 2t/(1 + t²)^2 dt. The integral becomes:\n\n∫₀^infty arctan(t²/(1 + t²)) / sqrt( t²/(1 + t²) * 1/(1 + t²) ) * 2t/(1 + t²)^2 dt.\n\nSimplify the denominator: sqrt(t²/(1 + t²)^2) = t/(1 + t²). So the integrand becomes:\n\narctan(t²/(1 + t²)) / (t/(1 + t²)) * 2t/(1 + t²)^2 dt = arctan(t²/(1 + t²)) * (1 + t²)/t * 2t/(1 + t²)^2 dt = 2 arctan(t²/(1 + t²)) / (1 + t²) dt.\n\nSo I = 2 ∫₀^infty arctan(t²/(1 + t²)) / (1 + t²) dt.\n\nNote that t²/(1 + t²) =1 - 1/(1 + t²). So arctan(1 - 1/(1 + t²)). Let me use the identity arctan(a) - arctan(b) = arctan( (a - b)/(1 + ab) ). Let’s set a =1, b =1/(1 + t²). Then, arctan(1) - arctan(1/(1 + t²)) = arctan( (1 - 1/(1 + t²)) / (1 + 1/(1 + t²)) ) = arctan( t²/(1 + t² +1) ) = arctan( t²/(t² +2) ). But we have arctan(1 - 1/(1 + t²)) = arctan(t²/(1 + t²)). So according to the identity, arctan(1) - arctan(1/(1 + t²)) = arctan(t²/(1 + t²)). Therefore, arctan(t²/(1 + t²)) = π/4 - arctan(1/(1 + t²)).\n\nThus, I = 2 ∫₀^infty [π/4 - arctan(1/(1 + t²)) ] / (1 + t²) dt = 2*(π/4 ∫₀^infty 1/(1 + t²) dt - ∫₀^infty arctan(1/(1 + t²))/(1 + t²) dt).\n\nThe first integral is π/4 * [arctan(t)]₀^∞ = π/4 * (π/2 -0) = π²/8. The second integral is ∫₀^infty arctan(1/(1 + t²))/(1 + t²) dt. Let me denote this integral as L. So I = 2*(π²/8 - L) = π²/4 - 2L.\n\nBut we need to compute I, which is equal to π arctan( sqrt{(sqrt(2)-1)/2} ). Therefore, π arctan(...) = π²/4 - 2L. Thus, solving for L: L = (π²/4 - π arctan(...))/2.\n\nBut unless we can compute L independently, this might not help. Alternatively, perhaps compute L using substitution. Let’s make substitution u = 1/(1 + t²). Then, t = sqrt((1 - u)/u), dt = - (1)/(2u sqrt(u(1 - u))) du. When t=0, u=1; t=∞, u=0. So integral L becomes ∫₁^0 arctan(u) / (1 + ( (1 - u)/u )) * (-1/(2u sqrt(u(1 - u))) du. Simplify the denominator: 1 + (1 - u)/u = (u +1 -u)/u =1/u. So L = ∫₀¹ arctan(u) / (1/u) * (1/(2u sqrt(u(1 - u))) du = ∫₀¹ arctan(u) * u / (1) * 1/(2u sqrt(u(1 - u))) du = ∫₀¹ arctan(u) / (2 sqrt(u(1 - u))) du. But this is equal to (1/2) I. Therefore, L = I/2. Therefore, substituting back into the equation: I = π²/4 - 2*(I/2) = π²/4 - I. Therefore, I + I = π²/4 => 2I = π²/4 => I = π²/8. Wait, but the original integral is supposed to be π arctan( sqrt{(sqrt(2)-1)/2} ). But according to this, I = π²/8 ≈ 1.2337, but the user's expected result is π * arctan(sqrt{(sqrt(2)-1)/2}) ≈ π *0.4305≈1.352, which is different. So this suggests a mistake in the reasoning.\n\nWhere did I go wrong? Let's check:\n\nStarting from I = 2 ∫₀^∞ [π/4 - arctan(1/(1 + t²)) ] / (1 + t²) dt.\n\nThen I = 2*(π/4 ∫₀^∞ dt/(1 + t²) - ∫₀^∞ arctan(1/(1 + t²))/(1 + t²) dt).\n\nThe first term: ∫₀^∞ dt/(1 + t²) = π/2. So π/4 * π/2 = π²/8. Then multiply by 2: π²/4.\n\nSecond term: 2 * ∫₀^∞ arctan(1/(1 + t²))/(1 + t²) dt = 2L.\n\nThen, when computing L, we found that L = I/2. So I = π²/4 - 2*(I/2) = π²/4 - I. Then, 2I = π²/4 => I = π²/8. But according to the problem statement, I should be equal to π arctan(sqrt{(sqrt(2)-1)/2}), which is not equal to π²/8. Therefore, there must be an error in the derivation.\n\nWait, the mistake is in the substitution for L. Let me recheck:\n\nWhen we set u = 1/(1 + t²), then t = sqrt((1 - u)/u). Therefore, 1 + t² =1 + (1 - u)/u = 1/u. So t = sqrt( (1 - u)/u ), and dt = derivative of sqrt((1 - u)/u) du. Let's compute dt:\n\nLet’s set u =1/(1 + t²), so t = sqrt( (1 - u)/u ). Therefore, dt/du = [ ( -1/(2 sqrt((1 - u)/u)) ) * ( (1 - u)/u )' ].\n\nLet’s compute derivative of (1 - u)/u with respect to u: [ -1*u - (1 - u)*1 ] / u² = (-u -1 +u)/u² = -1/u².\n\nThus, dt/du = [ -1/(2 sqrt((1 - u)/u) ) ] * ( -1/u² ) = 1/(2 sqrt((1 - u)/u) u² ) = sqrt(u/(1 - u)) / (2 u² ) = 1/(2 u^(3/2) sqrt(1 - u)) ).\n\nTherefore, dt = 1/(2 u^(3/2) sqrt(1 - u)) du.\n\nSo the integral L = ∫₀^∞ arctan(1/(1 + t²)) / (1 + t²) dt becomes:\n\n∫₁^0 arctan(u) / (1 + t²) * dt. But 1 + t² =1 + (1 - u)/u =1/u. So 1/(1 + t²) =u.\n\nThus, L = ∫₁^0 arctan(u) * u * dt = ∫₀¹ arctan(u) * u * [1/(2 u^(3/2) sqrt(1 - u)) ] du = ∫₀¹ arctan(u) / (2 sqrt(u(1 - u)) ) du = (1/2) I.\n\nTherefore, L = I/2. Therefore, the equation is I = π²/4 - 2*(I/2) = π²/4 - I. Hence, 2I = π²/4 => I = π²/8 ≈ 1.2337. But this contradicts the problem statement which gives a different result. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the assumption that the substitution leads to L = I/2, or perhaps an error in earlier steps.\n\nBut according to the problem, the correct result is π arctan(sqrt{(sqrt(2)-1)/2}) ≈ π*0.4305 ≈ 1.352, which is larger than π²/8≈1.2337. Therefore, there must be an error in the reasoning. Where?\n\nWait, going back to the substitution where we expressed arctan(t²/(1 + t²)) as π/4 - arctan(1/(1 + t²)). Let me verify this identity.\n\nWe claimed that arctan(a) - arctan(b) = arctan( (a - b)/(1 + ab) ). So if a =1 and b =1/(1 + t²), then arctan(1) - arctan(1/(1 + t²)) = arctan( (1 - 1/(1 + t²))/(1 + 1/(1 + t²)) ) = arctan( t²/(2 + t²) ). But the original expression is arctan(t²/(1 + t²)), not arctan(t²/(2 + t²)). Therefore, there is a mistake here. The identity gives arctan(1) - arctan(1/(1 + t²)) = arctan( t²/(2 + t²) ), but we have arctan(t²/(1 + t²)) in the integral. Therefore, the previous step where we expressed arctan(t²/(1 + t²)) = π/4 - arctan(1/(1 + t²)) is incorrect. This was the critical error.\n\nTherefore, that approach is invalid. Hence, the conclusion I = π²/8 is incorrect.\n\nThis means we must abandon that path and consider another method.\n\nLet’s consider differentiating the original integral with respect to a parameter. Let’s define I(a) = ∫₀¹ arctan(a x)/sqrt(x(1 - x)) dx. Then, I’(a) = ∫₀¹ x/(1 + a²x²) / sqrt(x(1 - x)) dx = ∫₀¹ sqrt(x)/(1 + a²x²) / sqrt(1 - x) dx. Let’s make substitution x = sin²θ. Then, dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ, sqrt(x) = sinθ, sqrt(1 - x) = cosθ. So I’(a) = ∫₀^{π/2} sinθ / (1 + a² sin⁴θ) * 2 sinθ cosθ / cosθ dθ = 2 ∫₀^{π/2} sin²θ / (1 + a² sin⁴θ) dθ.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated, but maybe express sin²θ in terms of double angles: sin²θ = (1 - cos2θ)/2. So I’(a) = 2 ∫₀^{π/2} (1 - cos2θ)/2 / (1 + a² ( (1 - cos2θ)/2 )² ) dθ = ∫₀^{π/2} (1 - cos2θ) / (1 + (a²/4)(1 - cos2θ)^2 ) dθ. Let’s set φ = 2θ, then dφ = 2 dθ, limits from 0 to π. So I’(a) = (1/2) ∫₀^π (1 - cosφ) / (1 + (a²/4)(1 - cosφ)^2 ) dφ.\n\nUsing the identity 1 - cosφ = 2 sin²(φ/2), and let’s set ψ = φ/2, so dφ = 2 dψ, limits from 0 to π/2. Then, I’(a) = (1/2) ∫₀^{π} [2 sin²(φ/2)] / [1 + (a²/4)(4 sin⁴(φ/2)) ] * dφ = (1/2) ∫₀^{π} [2 sin²(φ/2)] / [1 + a² sin⁴(φ/2) ] dφ. Substitute ψ = φ/2: I’(a) = (1/2) * 2 ∫₀^{π/2} sin²ψ / [1 + a² sin⁴ψ ] * 2 dψ = 2 ∫₀^{π/2} sin²ψ / [1 + a² sin⁴ψ ] dψ.\n\nThis still seems complex. Perhaps another substitution t = tanψ. Then, sinψ = t/sqrt(1 + t²), dψ = dt/(1 + t²). So integral becomes 2 ∫₀^infty [ t²/(1 + t²) ] / [1 + a² (t^4)/(1 + t²)^2 ] * dt/(1 + t²) = 2 ∫₀^infty t² / (1 + t²)^2 / [1 + a² t^4/(1 + t²)^2 ] dt. Simplify denominator: 1 + a² t^4/(1 + t²)^2 = [ (1 + t²)^2 + a² t^4 ] / (1 + t²)^2. So reciprocal is (1 + t²)^2 / [ (1 + t²)^2 + a² t^4 ]. Thus, the integral becomes 2 ∫₀^infty t² (1 + t²)^2 / [ (1 + t²)^2 + a² t^4 ] * dt/(1 + t²)^2 = 2 ∫₀^infty t² / [ (1 + t²)^2 + a² t^4 ] dt.\n\nExpand denominator: (1 + t²)^2 + a² t^4 =1 + 2t² + t^4 + a² t^4 =1 + 2t² + t^4(1 + a²). Let’s write as t^4(1 + a²) + 2t² +1. Let’s set u = t², then integral becomes ∫₀^infty u / [ (1 + a²) u² + 2u +1 ] du. Let’s factor the denominator: (1 + a²)u² + 2u +1. This is a quadratic in u. The discriminant is 4 -4*(1 + a²)*1=4-4-4a²= -4a². So the roots are complex: u = [-2 ± sqrt(-4a²)] / [2(1 + a²)] = [-1 ± ai]/(1 + a²). Therefore, the denominator can be written as (1 + a²)(u + (1 - ai)/(1 + a²))(u + (1 + ai)/(1 + a²)).\n\nBut integrating u / [(1 + a²)u² + 2u +1] du from 0 to ∞. Let’s complete the square:\n\nDenominator: (1 + a²)u² + 2u +1 = (1 + a²)[u² + 2u/(1 + a²)] +1 = (1 + a²)[ (u + 1/(1 + a²))² - 1/(1 + a²)^2 ] +1 = (1 + a²)(u + 1/(1 + a²))² -1/(1 + a²) +1 = (1 + a²)(u + 1/(1 + a²))² + (1 -1/(1 + a²)) = (1 + a²)(u + 1/(1 + a²))² + a²/(1 + a²).\n\nThus, the integral becomes ∫₀^infty u / [ (1 + a²)(u + c)^2 + d ] du, where c =1/(1 + a²) and d = a²/(1 + a²). Let’s make substitution v = u + c, then u = v - c, du = dv. The integral becomes ∫_{c}^infty (v - c) / [ (1 + a²)v² + d ] dv. Split into two integrals:\n\n∫_{c}^infty v / [ (1 + a²)v² + d ] dv - c ∫_{c}^infty 1 / [ (1 + a²)v² + d ] dv.\n\nFirst integral: let’s set w = (1 + a²)v² + d, dw = 2(1 + a²)v dv. So (1/(2(1 + a²))) ∫ dw/w from v=c to ∞. The limits become w(c) = (1 + a²)c² + d = (1 + a²)(1/(1 + a²)^2) + a²/(1 + a²)) = 1/(1 + a²) + a²/(1 + a²) =1. So the first integral is (1/(2(1 + a²))) ∫₁^∞ dw/w = (1/(2(1 + a²))) [ln w]₁^∞ diverges. This suggests that the integral diverges, which can’t be true since the original I’(a) should converge. Therefore, there must be a mistake in this approach.\n\nBut we know that I(a) converges for all a, including a=1. Therefore, the previous step must have an error. The mistake is likely in the substitution process when changing variables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the integral I’(a) can be expressed in terms of known functions. The integral ∫₀^infty t² / [ (1 + a²)t^4 + 2t² +1 ] dt. Let’s denote this integral as J(a).\n\nLet’s factor the denominator: (1 + a²)t^4 + 2t² +1. This can be written as (t^2 + p)(t^2 + q) where p and q are roots of the quadratic equation (1 + a²)x² + 2x +1 =0. The roots are x = [-2 ± sqrt(4 -4(1 + a²))]/[2(1 + a²))]. The discriminant is 4 -4(1 + a²) = -4a². So complex roots. Therefore, the denominator doesn't factor into real quadratics, making partial fractions difficult.\n\nAlternatively, express the integral as J(a) = ∫₀^infty t² / [ (1 + a²)t^4 + 2t² +1 ] dt. Let’s divide numerator and denominator by t^4:\n\nJ(a) = ∫₀^infty 1/t² / [ (1 + a²) + 2/t² +1/t^4 ] dt. Let’s set u =1/t, then when t→0, u→∞; t→∞, u→0. So J(a) = ∫₀^infty u² / [ (1 + a²) + 2u² +u^4 ] du. This is the same as the original integral. Therefore, J(a) = ∫₀^infty u² / [ u^4 + 2u² + (1 + a²) ] du. Let’s write the denominator as u^4 + 2u² + (1 + a²) = (u^2 +1)^2 + a². So J(a) = ∫₀^infty u² / [ (u^2 +1)^2 + a² ] du. This resembles an integral that can be evaluated using substitution involving arctan. Let’s set u = tanθ, then du = sec²θ dθ, u^2 +1 = sec²θ. The integral becomes ∫₀^{π/2} tan²θ / [ sec^4θ + a² ] * sec²θ dθ = ∫₀^{π/2} tan²θ sec²θ / (sec^4θ + a²) dθ. Simplify: tan²θ sec²θ = sin²θ/cos^4θ. Denominator: sec^4θ +a² =1/cos^4θ +a². So integral becomes",
