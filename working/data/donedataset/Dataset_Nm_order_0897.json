    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange problem into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should list each condition on one line, and the problem statement is simplified. \n\nThe original problem is about the integral I_n = ∫₀^{π/2} xⁿ/sinⁿx dx for positive integers n. The question mentions specific results for I₁, I₂, I₄ and asks for proofs or progress on I₃ or the general case. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that n is a positive integer, which is one condition. The integral is defined from 0 to π/2, so the limits of integration are part of the problem setup. The integrand is xⁿ over sinⁿx. The results given for specific n (1, 2, 4) are part of the context but not assumptions. The user is asking about proving these results or making progress on I₃ or general n.\n\nSo the assumptions should include that n is a positive integer, the integral is from 0 to π/2, and the integrand is xⁿ/sinⁿx. Each of these is a separate line. The problem part will be to prove the given results or make progress on I₃ or the general case. But according to the example, the problem statement should be concise. The user probably wants the problem part to be the main question, which is to prove any of the results or make progress on I₃ or the general case.\n\nSo structuring this:\n\nAssumptions:\n- n is a positive integer,\n- the integral is evaluated from 0 to π/2,\n- the integrand is xⁿ divided by sinⁿx.\n\nProblem: Prove the results for I₁, I₂, I₄ or make progress on evaluating I₃ and the general case.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, n is given as a positive integer. The integrand structure is part of the problem definition. The problem as stated in the question is asking for proofs of the specific cases or progress on I₃/general case. So the problem statement in the formatted version should capture that request.\n\nSo the formatted problem would list the assumptions about n, the integral's bounds, and the integrand. The problem is to prove the given results or make progress on I₃ or the general case. Let me check if the example includes all parts. The example had the assumption about n being integer and divisible by 7, then the problem to prove the expression is divisible by 91. Here, the problem is similar but more open-ended. So the problem statement here is: Can we prove any of these results, or make any progress on I_3, or the general case?\n\nBut according to the example, the problem part is a statement, not a question. So maybe rephrase it as \"Prove the results for I₁, I₂, I₄ or make progress on evaluating I₃ and the general case.\"\n\nAlternatively, the original problem is asking whether we can prove any of these or make progress. But the example's problem was \"Prove that...\". So maybe in the problem part, we need to write \"Prove the given results for I₁, I₂, I₄, or evaluate I₃ and the general case.\"\n\nWait, the original problem says: \"Can we prove any of these results, or make any progress on I_3, or the general case?\" So the problem is to address these questions. But the example's problem was phrased as a statement: \"Prove that...\".\n\nSo perhaps in the formatted problem, it's phrased as a statement: \"Prove the given results for I₁, I₂, I₄, or make progress on evaluating I₃ and the general case.\"\n\nBut maybe it's better to stick to the exact problem as in the original question. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem is \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" So here, the original question is asking to prove any of the results or make progress. So the problem part should be the same as the original question's request. So perhaps:\n\nProblem: Can we prove any of the given results for I₁, I₂, I₄, make progress on I₃, or address the general case?\n\nBut the example uses \"Prove that...\", which is a command. Since the original question is phrased as a question (\"Can we prove...\"), perhaps we need to adjust it to match the example's style. The example took the original problem, which was \"Prove that...\", and just restated it. Here, the original problem is asking whether we can prove or make progress. So maybe rephrase it as a directive: \"Prove any of the given results for I₁, I₂, I₄, make progress on evaluating I₃, or address the general case.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem should be stated as the integral expression and the request to evaluate or find expressions for specific n and general case. Wait, the example included the expression in the problem statement. In this case, the problem is already defined as I_n, so the problem part could be: \"Prove the results for I₁, I₂, I₄, or make progress on I₃ and the general case.\"\n\nBut perhaps the exact problem is to evaluate or find expressions for these integrals. The given problem statement in the original question includes the definition of I_n and asks for proofs or progress. So the formatted problem should include the integral definition and the request. Hmm. The example included the expression in the problem statement. Here, the problem is the integral I_n as defined, and the user is asking to prove the given results or make progress. So to structure this correctly:\n\nProblem: Prove the results for I₁, I₂, I₄, make progress on evaluating I₃, or address the general case for $$I_n=\\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\frac{x^n}{\\sin ^n x} \\ \\mathrm{d}x, \\quad n\\in \\mathbb{Z}^+.$$\n\nBut in the example, they included the expression again. So maybe:\n\nProblem: Prove that for positive integers n, the integral $$I_n=\\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\frac{x^n}{\\sin ^n x} \\ \\mathrm{d}x$$ satisfies the given results for I₁, I₂, I₄, or make progress on I₃ and the general case.\n\nAlternatively, the problem statement could be the original question's request. Since the example included the expression in the problem part, perhaps we should include it here as well. So:\n\nProblem: Can we prove any of the results for I₁ = 2C, I₂ = π log 2, I₄ = -π³/12 + 2π log 2 + π³/3 log 2 - 3π/2 ζ(3), make progress on I₃, or address the general case for $$I_n=\\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\frac{x^n}{\\sin ^n x} \\ \\mathrm{d}x, \\quad n\\in \\mathbb{Z}^+?$$\n\nBut the example didn't list the specific results in the problem statement. It just mentioned the expression. The original example had the user's expression and the problem was to prove divisibility. Here, the problem is more about evaluating the integral for specific n or general. So perhaps the problem statement is to evaluate or find expressions for I_n, especially for n=1,2,4 as given, and progress on n=3 or general.\n\nBut in the example, the problem was phrased as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" Here, the problem is to prove the given evaluations of I₁, I₂, I₄, or find I₃ or general. So the problem part should be: Prove the evaluations of I₁, I₂, I₄, make progress on I₃, or evaluate the general case for the integral I_n.\n\nBut to align with the example, maybe it's better to state the problem as:\n\nProblem: Prove that the integral $$I_n=\\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\frac{x^n}{\\sin ^n x} \\ \\mathrm{d}x$$ satisfies the given results for n=1,2,4, or make progress on evaluating I_3 and the general case.\n\nBut the example didn't include the \"make progress\" part; it was a direct statement. Since the original problem is asking for proofs or progress, perhaps the problem should capture that. However, the example's format seems to focus on the main task. Given that the user provided an example where the assumption included a condition (n divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem, but in this case, the original problem doesn't have additional assumptions beyond n being a positive integer and the integral's setup. \n\nWait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait no, the example actually had:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut that seems like a mistake. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption says n is an integer and divisible by 7. That seems like an error. Wait, maybe the example was a hypothetical or modified. But perhaps in this case, the user wants us to extract the assumptions from the problem statement, not add new ones. Wait, looking back, the example's original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption lists n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that would mean the problem is to prove divisibility by 91 under the assumption that n is divisible by 7. But the original problem didn't have that. So perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user provided it as their own example. Therefore, perhaps the task is to structure the problem as per the user's example, which may include filtering out some info and listing assumptions even if they are part of the problem's inherent conditions.\n\nIn the current problem, the integral is defined for n in Z^+. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n\n- The integral is from 0 to π/2.\n\n- The integrand is x^n / sin^n x.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions included both the variable's type (integer) and a condition (divisible by 7). Here, the problem doesn't have extra conditions beyond n being a positive integer, so maybe the assumptions are just:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n\nBut the integral's limits and integrand are part of the problem's statement, not assumptions. Wait, in the example, the assumption included the divisibility by 7, which was not in the original problem. That suggests that perhaps the user's example is wrong, but since the user provided it, we need to follow their lead.\n\nWait, the original example's original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption includes n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake, unless the user intended to modify the problem. Maybe the example is incorrect, but we have to follow the user's structure regardless.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question states that n is in Z^+, so the assumption is n is a positive integer. The integral is defined from 0 to π/2 with integrand x^n/sin^n x. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is a positive integer,\n\n- the integral is evaluated from 0 to π/2,\n\n- the integrand is x^n divided by sin^n x.\n\nEach of these is a separate line. Then the problem is to prove the given results for I₁, I₂, I₄, make progress on I₃, or the general case.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n- n is a positive integer,\n- the integral is evaluated from 0 to π/2,\n- the integrand is x^n divided by sin^n x.\n\nProblem:\nProve the results for I₁ = 2C, I₂ = π log 2, I₄ = -π³/12 + 2π log 2 + π³/3 log 2 - 3π/2 ζ(3), make progress on I₃, or address the general case for the integral I_n.\n\nAlternatively, to match the example's brevity, perhaps the problem is stated as:\n\nProve that the integral $$I_n=\\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\frac{x^n}{\\sin ^n x} \\ \\mathrm{d}x$$ satisfies the given results for n=1,2,4, or make progress on evaluating I_3 and the general case.\n\nBut the example included the full expression in the problem. So including the integral expression in the problem statement is necessary.\n\nIn the example, the problem was \"Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" So here, similarly, the problem would be \"Prove that the integral I_n satisfies the given results for n=1,2,4, or make progress on evaluating I_3 and the general case.\"\n\nBut the problem statement might be too long. Alternatively, since the user's example included the expression in the problem part, we should do the same here. So:\n\nProblem: Prove that $$I_n=\\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\frac{x^n}{\\sin ^n x} \\ \\mathrm{d}x, \\quad n\\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$$ satisfies the results for I₁, I₂, I₄, or make progress on I₃ and the general case.\n\nBut the specific results are listed in the question. However, including all of them in the problem statement might be too lengthy. The example didn't list the specific results in the problem part, only the expression. So perhaps:\n\nProblem: Prove the results for the integral $$I_n=\\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\frac{x^n}{\\sin ^n x} \\ \\mathrm{d}x, \\quad n\\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$$ as given for n=1,2,4, or make progress on n=3 and the general case.\n\nThat seems concise and aligns with the example's style.",
