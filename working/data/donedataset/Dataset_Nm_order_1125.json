    "Content": "Let $R$ be a domain that is not a field, and let $M$ be an $R$-module that is both injective and projective. Prove that $M= \\left \\{ 0 \\right \\}$. This is exercise 7.52 of Rotman's Advanced Modern Algebra . Using theorems before exercises, because $M$ is injective and $R$ is a domain, I conclude that $$\\forall m\\in M ,\\forall r\\in R\\ (r\\neq 0) ,\\exists {m}'\\in M \\Rightarrow m=r{m}'$$\nand also because $M$ is projective there is a surjective $\\psi$ from free $R$-module $F$ with basis $\\left \\{ e_{i} \\right \\}_{i\\in I}$ to $M$ and thus we can conclude that for every $m\\in M$ we have $$m=\\sum r_{i}\\Psi (e_{i})$$\nnow I don't know how should I use these together. The idea of what is happening or a suggestion or a hint will be great.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "As you remarked, injective modules are divisible, that is, $rM=M$ for all $r\\in R$, $r\\ne 0$. The key step is to show that every non-zero homomorphism $f:M\\to R$ is surjective . Let $x\\in M$ such that $f(x)\\ne 0$. Set $r=f(x)$. Since $rM=M$ there exists $y\\in M$ such that $ry=x$. Then $rf(y)=r$, so $f(y)=1$, and this is enough. Now use that $M$ is projective: there exists $F$ a free module of base $(e_i)_{i\\in I}$ such that $0\\to M\\to F$. Consider $p_i:F\\to Re_i\\cong R$ the canonical projection. If $M\\ne 0$ there is an $i\\in I$ such that $p_i(M)\\ne 0$, so the homomorphism $M\\to F\\stackrel{p_i}\\to R\\stackrel{r\\cdot}\\to R$ is non-zero for each $r\\in R$, $r\\ne 0$. This homomorphism must be surjective, so $1=rp_i(z)$ for some $z\\in M$, and this shows that $R$ is a field, a contradiction.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a domain R that's not a field, and an R-module M that's both injective and projective. We need to prove that M must be the zero module. \n\nFirst, let me recall some properties of injective and projective modules over a domain. Since R is a domain, injective modules have the property that every element can be divided by any non-zero element of R. That comes from the definition of divisible modules, right? Because for an injective module over a domain, divisibility is a key feature. So, the user mentioned that for every m in M and every non-zero r in R, there exists an m' in M such that m = r m'. That makes sense because injective modules over domains are divisible.\n\nNow, M is also projective. Projective modules are direct summands of free modules. So, there's a free module F and a surjective homomorphism ψ from F to M with a splitting map, meaning that M is a direct summand of F. The user also mentions that every element m in M can be written as a linear combination of the images of the basis elements of F under ψ. That seems right because F is free with basis {e_i}, and ψ is surjective, so the images ψ(e_i) generate M.\n\nBut how do these two properties interact? Let's think. If M is projective, it's a direct summand of a free module. But R is not a field, so free modules over R (which is a domain) have certain properties. For instance, in a domain, ideals are projective if and only if they are invertible. But here, M is not just projective but also injective.\n\nWait, over a domain, the only module that is both injective and projective is the zero module? That seems to be the case here. Let me see why. If M is projective, then it's a direct summand of a free module. If it's also injective, then it must be divisible. But in a domain that's not a field, free modules can't be divisible unless they're zero. For example, in the integers, the module Z is not divisible because you can't divide every element by 2. Similarly, in a domain R that's not a field, there exists a non-unit element r. If M is free, then multiplying by r would not be surjective unless M is zero. But M is a direct summand of a free module. If the free module is non-zero, can its summand be divisible? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since M is projective and injective, it's both a direct summand of a free module and divisible. But in a domain, the only divisible projective module is zero. Let me check that. Suppose M is projective, so it's a submodule of a free module. But if it's also divisible, then every element must be divisible by any non-zero r. However, in a free module over a domain, non-zero elements can't be divisible by all non-zero r unless the module is torsion-free and divisible, which over a domain would imply it's a vector space. But R is not a field, so there are no non-zero vector spaces over R. Therefore, M must be zero.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the structure theorem or some known results. Rotman's book might have theorems about injective modules over domains. For instance, over a Noetherian domain, injective modules have certain decompositions, but here R is just a domain. Alternatively, since M is injective, it's divisible. If M is projective, then it's torsion-free (since projective modules over domains are torsion-free). So, M is torsion-free and divisible. But over a domain, the only torsion-free divisible module is the zero module. Because if it's divisible, then for every m in M and non-zero r in R, there's an m' such that m = r m'. But if M is torsion-free, then multiplication by r is injective. So, multiplication by r is both injective and surjective, making it invertible. But in a domain that's not a field, there are elements r that are not units. Therefore, unless M is zero, this can't happen. Hence, M must be zero.\n\nYes, that seems like the right path. So, combining the two properties: projective implies torsion-free, injective implies divisible. Torsion-free and divisible over a domain that's not a field implies the module is zero. Therefore, M must be the zero module.",
