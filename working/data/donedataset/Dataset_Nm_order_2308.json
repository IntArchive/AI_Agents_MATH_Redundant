    "Content": "How can we prove that the space of homeomorphisms Homeo$(S^1)$ of $S^1$ (strong) deformation retracts onto the orthogonal group $O(2)$? I know that this result is proved by Hellmuth Kneser in his paper Die Deformationssätze der einfach zusammenhängenden Flächen. I want to learn somewhat more elementary proof if possible, or at least the idea of the proof. Added Later (The topology on the space of homeomorphisms Homeo$(S^1)$ of $S^1$). This is footnote 7 from Hutchings' lecture notes, Introduction to homotopy groups and obstruction theory : We topologize the space Maps$(X, Y)$ of continuous maps from $X$ to\n  $Y$ using the compact-open topology. For details on this see e.g.\n  Hatcher. A key property of this topology is that if $Y$ is locally\n  compact, then a map $X \\rightarrow$ Maps$(Y,Z)$ is continuous iff the\n  corresponding map $X \\times Y \\rightarrow Z$ is continuous.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The following is essentially a fleshed-out version of the proof of Proposition 4.2 in Ghys's beautiful article Groups acting on the circle . It is convenient to translate the question into a question about continuous functions on $\\mathbb{R}$ . Viewing the circle $S^1 = \\mathbb{R}/\\mathbb{Z}$ as a quotient of $\\mathbb{R}$ , a continuous function $f\\colon S^1 \\to S^1$ can be lifted over the covering projection $\\pi \\colon \\mathbb{R} \\to S^1$ to a continuous function $F \\colon \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f \\circ \\pi = \\pi \\circ F$ : on the fundamental domain $[0,1)$ the function $F$ is determined by $f$ up to addition of an integer, and once that integer is chosen, there is only one way to extend $F$ continuously to all of $\\mathbb{R}$ . A continuous function $F \\colon \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is the lift of a continuous function $f \\colon S^1 \\to S^1$ if and only if there is $d \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ such that for all $x$ the equation $F(x+1) = F(x) + d$ holds. It is not hard to see that $d = \\deg{f}$ . Using this [or by elementary considerations with the intermediate value theorem] we see that $f$ can only be a homeomorphism if $d = \\pm 1$ : the lifts of a homeomorphism must satisfy $F(x+1) = F(x) \\pm 1$ . The lift $F$ of a homeomorphism $f$ is a homeomorphism because continuous bijections $\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ have continuous inverses. Let $\\tilde{H} = \\operatorname{Homeo}_\\mathbb{Z}(\\mathbb{R})$ be the group of homeomorphisms $F \\colon \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $F(x+1) = F(x) +1$ .\nThe compact-open topology on $\\tilde{H}$ coincides with the uniform topology and is metrized by $d(F,G) = \\sup_{x \\in [0,1]} \\lvert F(x) - G(x)\\rvert$ since $F-G$ is $1$ -periodic. If $F,G \\in \\tilde{H}$ then their convex combinations $(1-t)F + tG$ belong to $\\tilde{H}$ for all $t \\in [0,1]$ : they are strictly increasing and surjective. The map $$h\\colon [0,1] \\times \\tilde{H} \\times \\tilde{H} \\longrightarrow \\tilde{H}, \\quad(t,F,G) \\longmapsto (1-t)F + tG$$ is clearly continuous. This shows that $\\tilde{H}$ is contractible, as we can take $G$ to be the identity $G(x) = x$ and for all $F \\in \\tilde{H}$ we have $h(0,F,G) = F$ and $h(1,F,G) = G$ . The map $F \\mapsto f$ sending $F \\in \\tilde{H}$ to the homeomorphism of $S^1$ it covers is a continuous homomorphism $p\\colon \\tilde{H} \\to H = \\operatorname{Homeo}_+(S^1)$ onto the group of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms (i.e., those $f \\colon S^1 \\to S^1$ preserving the cyclic order of triples of pairwise distinct points on the circle). The kernel of $p$ can be identified with $\\mathbb{Z} = \\langle \\tau \\rangle$ generated by the unit translation $\\tau(x) = x + 1$ . In fact, $p$ identifies $\\tilde{H}$ with the universal covering group of $H$ . Observe that $f = p(F)$ is a rotation with angle $[\\alpha] \\in \\mathbb{R/Z}$ if and only if $F(x) = x + \\alpha$ is a translation. Now notice that each $F \\in \\tilde{H}$ can be uniquely written as $F(x) = x + \\alpha_F + \\varphi_F(x)$ with $\\alpha_F = \\int_{0}^1 [F(x)-x]\\,dx \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $\\varphi(x) = F(x) - x -\\alpha$ is a $1$ -periodic function with mean zero: $\\int_{0}^1 \\varphi(t)\\,dt = 0$ . Since $F_n \\to F$ in $\\tilde{H}$ means uniform convergence, we see that $\\alpha_F$ and $\\varphi_F$ depend continuously on $F$ . Thus, the map $$\n\\tilde{k} \\colon [0,1] \\times \\tilde{H} \\longrightarrow \\tilde{H} \\quad\n\\tilde{k}(t,F) =  x + \\alpha_F + (1-t)\\varphi_F\n$$ is continuous and $\\tilde{k}(0,F) = F$ while $\\tilde{k}(1,F) = x+\\alpha_F$ covers a rotation, i.e., an element of $SO(2)$ . If $F(x) = x + \\alpha$ is a translation then $\\tilde k(t,F) = F$ for all $t \\in [0,1]$ , so $\\tilde k$ is constant on the group of translations. For two lifts $F_1(x) = x + \\alpha_{F_1} + \\varphi_{F_1}(x)$ and $F_{2}(x) = x + \\alpha_{F_2} + \\varphi_{F_2}(x)$ of the homeomorphism $f \\colon S^1 \\to S^1$ we have $\\varphi_{F_1} = \\varphi_{F_2}$ and $\\alpha_{F_1} - \\alpha_{F_2} \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ . This implies that $\\tilde{k}(t,F_1)$ and $\\tilde{k}(t,F_2)$ cover the same homeomorphism of $S^1$ and hence $\\tilde{k}$ yields a continuous map $k\\colon [0,1] \\times H \\to H$ which is a deformation retraction from $\\operatorname{Homeo}_+(S^1)$ to $SO(2)$ . The argument for the group of all homeomorphisms of $S^1$ is essentially the same: If $f$ reverses orientation then its lifts are of the form $F(x+1) = F(x) - 1$ and $F$ is strictly decreasing. Now define $\\alpha_F = \\int_{0}^1 [F(x) + x]\\,dx$ and $\\varphi_F = F + x - \\alpha_F$ to obtain a homotopy from $F$ to $\\alpha_F - x$ , covering the reflection at the line with angle $\\alpha_F/2$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the core problem.\n\nThe original question is about proving that the space of homeomorphisms Homeo(S¹) deformation retracts onto O(2). The user mentioned that Kneser proved this but they want a more elementary proof or idea. There's also a footnote about the topology on Homeo(S¹) using the compact-open topology, which is important for understanding the problem's context.\n\nAssumptions should list each condition on a separate line. Let's see:\n\n1. The space in question is Homeo(S¹), the space of homeomorphisms of the circle S¹.\n2. The topology on Homeo(S¹) is the compact-open topology. The footnote explains this, so it's an assumption about the topology used.\n3. The problem involves a (strong) deformation retraction from Homeo(S¹) to O(2), the orthogonal group. So each object's conditions: Homeo(S¹) is the main space, O(2) is the target.\n\nWait, the original problem doesn't state any additional assumptions beyond what's given. The user is asking for the proof under the standard setup where Homeo(S¹) has the compact-open topology, and they want the deformation retraction to O(2). So the assumptions are about the space being Homeo(S¹) with that topology, and the deformation retract target being O(2). Maybe also that the maps are continuous, but the topology already covers that.\n\nI need to ensure each assumption is a single property applied to one object. Let me list them:\n\n- Homeo(S¹) is the space of homeomorphisms of the circle S¹.\n- The topology on Homeo(S¹) is the compact-open topology.\n- The orthogonal group O(2) is a subspace of Homeo(S¹).\n- The deformation retraction is required to be strong.\n\nWait, does the problem mention \"strong\" deformation retraction? The original title says \"(strong) deformation retracts\". So yes, that's part of the problem. So that's another assumption: the deformation retraction is strong.\n\nPutting it all together, each line addresses one property or condition for one object. The problem is to prove the existence of such a deformation retraction.",
