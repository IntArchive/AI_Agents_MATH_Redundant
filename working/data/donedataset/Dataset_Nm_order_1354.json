    "Content": "First, I want to figure out why, for the simple case where $ g:[a,b]\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R} $ is bounded and continuous except at some point $ x_0\\in[a,b], $ $ g$ is Riemann integrable on [a,b]. I know the Riemann integrability condition that there must exist some partition $ P $ for which $ U(P,f) - L(P,f)\\leq\\epsilon, \\forall \\epsilon>0 $. For my attempt at a proof, I said: Let $ P=\\{x_0,x_1,\\cdots,x_n:x_0=a<x_1<\\cdots<x_n=b\\} $ be a partition of $ [a,b] $. Let $ x_0\\in[x_{k-1},x_k]. $ Then normally for an everywhere continuous function, since $ [a,b] $ is a compact set, the function is uniformly continuous and therefore $ \\exists\\delta(\\epsilon):|x-y|<\\delta\\implies|f(x)-f(y)|<\\epsilon,\\forall\\epsilon>0 $.  Using this, we can make any of the subintervals in the partition arbitrarily small, and eventually make the difference between the upper and lower sums arbitrarily small by using the property that a continuous function will attain its maximum and minimum.  But how do I do something similar for $ g $?  Furthermore, how can I extend that to the case in which $ g $ is discontinuous at $ x_0, x_1, \\cdots, x_n $? EDIT: Using ncmathsadist's advice, Let $\\epsilon > 0$.  Let $M = \\sup_{x\\in[a,b]} f$. Let $ D=\\{x_0,x_1,\\cdots,x_{2n}:x_0<x_1<\\cdots<x_{2n}\\} $ be a subpartition containing all the points $ x_0,x_1,\\cdots,x_n $ where $ g $ is discontinuous, such that $ \\sum_{i=1}^{2n}(x_i-x_{i-1}) < \\frac{\\epsilon}{2M}$ Let $ C $ be a subpartition containing all the other points.  By visiting the proof that a continuous function is Riemann integrable, I can construct a $ C $ so that: $ U(C\\bigcup D,f)-L(C\\bigcup D,f)< \\frac{\\epsilon}{2M}\\times M+\\frac{\\epsilon}{2}=\\epsilon $ This is because $ g $ is bounded, and any contribution by $ g $ to the sum from the discontinuous point must be less than the maximum, $ M $.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $\\epsilon > 0$.  Put $M = \\sup_{x\\in[a,b]} f$.  Now choose a partition so that the total length of the intervals containing the discontnuities of $f$ is smaller than $\\epsilon/2M$.  The contribution from the intervals with discontinuities of $f$ is smaller than $\\epsilon/2$.  Since $f$ is continuous on the rest, it is fairly easy to engineer an argument that supplies a partition whose upper and lower sums differ by less than $\\epsilon/2$. Assemble the pieces and you have Riemann integrability.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, so I need to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me start by reading the original problem carefully.\n\nThe user is asking how to prove that a function with a finite number of discontinuities is Riemann integrable over some interval. They start with a specific case where the function g is bounded and has a single discontinuity at x_0 in [a,b], and then want to extend that to finitely many discontinuities. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The original problem mentions that g is defined on [a,b], is bounded, and has discontinuities at points x_0, x_1, ..., x_n. The key conditions here are:\n\n1. The function g is defined on the interval [a, b].\n2. The function g is bounded.\n3. The function g is continuous except at a finite number of points.\n\nEach of these should be a separate assumption. The problem then is to prove that such a function is Riemann integrable on [a, b].\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property. In the original problem, the user mentions \"bounded and continuous except at some point\" and then extends to multiple points. So the critical assumptions are the domain [a,b], boundedness, and finite discontinuities.\n\nI need to make sure not to include the user's attempt or their exploration of the proof in the assumptions. The assumptions are the given conditions of the problem. The user's discussion about partitions and epsilon is part of their attempt, which isn't part of the problem statement itself.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumptions:\n- $g$ is defined on the interval $[a, b]$,\n- $g$ is bounded,\n- $g$ is continuous except at a finite number of points.\n\nProblem: Prove that $g$ is Riemann integrable on $[a, b]$.\n\nI need to check if the user specifies that the interval is closed and bounded, but since [a,b] is given, that's already a closed interval. The key points are boundedness and finite discontinuities. The example given by the user had assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7, so similarly here, the three conditions are the main assumptions.",
