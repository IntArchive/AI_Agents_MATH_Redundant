    "AcceptedAnswer": "Update: This conjecture is false - note that it is equivalent to this conjecture , which was disproved by Nechemia Burshtein (See Example 2 after Question 6 here - Thanks to Lucid in the comments section of the other question for providing another reference that led to this.) Note that to see the two conjectures are equivalent, we can observe that $x_j\\mid \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$ for each $j$ if and only if $y_j:=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}{x_j}$ is an integer, in which case we have $$\\sum_{j=1}^n \\frac{1}{y_j}=\\sum_{j=1}^n \\frac{x_j}{\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}=1,$$ and then $x_j\\mid x_k$ if and only if $y_k\\mid y_j$ . Original remark: Here is an observation (too long for a comment, and actually leading to an answer for small $n$ .) Lemma. The conjecture is true whenever $\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^nx_i}{x_k}$ has only one distinct prime factor for some $k$ . Proof. Suppose $\\sum_{i=1}^nx_i=p^mx_k$ , for some prime $p$ and some $m$ .

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. So, the problem states that we have a finite sequence of positive integers, and each term in this sequence divides the sum of all the terms. We need to prove that there must be at least two terms in the sequence where one divides the other. \n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have numbers x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ, all positive integers. The sum S = x₁ + x₂ + ... + xₙ. The condition is that each x_i divides S. The conclusion is that among these x_i's, there are two distinct indices j and h such that x_j divides x_h or vice versa. \n\nSo, the user mentioned they tried induction but got stuck beyond the base case of n=2. Let me see how the base case works. For n=2, we have two numbers x₁ and x₂. Both divide the sum S = x₁ + x₂. So, x₁ divides S and x₂ divides S. Then, as shown in the question, this implies that x₁ divides x₂ and x₂ divides x₁, so they must be equal. Hence, in this case, one divides the other (since they're equal). So, the base case holds. \n\nBut induction seems tricky here because when you go from n to n+1, adding a new term might complicate things. The user also mentioned pigeonhole principle. Maybe another approach is needed. \n\nLet me think about the general case. Suppose we have n positive integers, each dividing their sum S. We need to show that at least two of them are such that one divides the other. \n\nOne idea: Let's consider the sum S. Each x_i divides S, so each x_i is a divisor of S. Therefore, all the x_i's are divisors of S. So, all the terms are in the set of divisors of S. \n\nNow, the set of divisors of S has a certain structure. For example, the divisors of S can be arranged in a partially ordered set under divisibility. If we have multiple divisors, maybe we can apply Dilworth's theorem or something related to antichains. But maybe that's too advanced. \n\nAlternatively, if all the x_i's are divisors of S, then if none of them divides another, then they form an antichain in the divisor lattice of S. By Dilworth's theorem, the size of such an antichain is bounded by the maximum size of a chain, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a more elementary approach. Let's think about the properties of divisors. If S is the sum, and each x_i divides S, then each x_i is at most S. Since they are positive integers, the minimal case is when each x_i is 1, but then all divide each other. But that's trivial. \n\nWait, but in the problem, the x_i's can be any positive integers. Suppose we have S = x₁ + x₂ + ... + xₙ. Each x_i divides S. So, S is a multiple of each x_i. Let's denote S = k_i * x_i for some integer k_i ≥ 1. \n\nSo, for each i, S = k_i * x_i. Therefore, x_i = S / k_i. \n\nBut since all x_i's sum up to S, we have:\n\nSum_{i=1 to n} x_i = Sum_{i=1 to n} (S / k_i) = S\n\nDivide both sides by S (since S is positive, we can do that):\n\nSum_{i=1 to n} (1 / k_i) = 1\n\nSo, the sum of reciprocals of the k_i's is 1. Each k_i is a positive integer (since S is a multiple of x_i, and x_i is positive). \n\nThis is an interesting equation. So, we have integers k₁, k₂, ..., kₙ ≥ 1 such that the sum of their reciprocals is 1. \n\nNow, our goal is to show that in this case, there must be two x_i's where one divides the other. But since x_i = S / k_i, then if x_j divides x_h, that would mean S / k_j divides S / k_h. Which simplifies to k_h divides k_j. Because (S/k_j) | (S/k_h) implies that there exists an integer m such that S/k_h = m*(S/k_j), so m = k_j / k_h. Therefore, k_j must be divisible by k_h. \n\nSimilarly, if k_h divides k_j, then x_j divides x_h. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to showing that if k₁, k₂, ..., kₙ are positive integers with sum of reciprocals equal to 1, then there exist two indices j and h such that k_h divides k_j. \n\nAlternatively, if none of the k_i's divides another, then the sum of reciprocals would be less than or equal to 1. Wait, but in our case, the sum is exactly 1. Maybe we can argue that if the k_i's are pairwise coprime or no one divides another, the sum would be less than 1. But this might not hold. \n\nFor example, consider k₁=2, k₂=3, k₃=6. Their reciprocals sum to 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/6 = 1. Here, 2 divides 6 and 3 divides 6, so there are divisors. \n\nAnother example: k₁=2, k₂=3, k₃=4, k₄=5. Then the sum of reciprocals is 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 = (30 + 20 + 15 + 12)/60 = 77/60 > 1. So, this would not be possible. Wait, but in our problem, the sum of reciprocals is exactly 1, so such a case with sum exceeding 1 is not possible. \n\nBut if we have pairwise non-dividing k_i's, can the sum of their reciprocals be 1? Let's see. For example, take k₁=2, k₂=3, k₃=6. As above, sum is 1, but 2 and 3 divide 6. If we avoid that, like take k₁=2, k₂=3, k₃=4. Sum is 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 = 13/12 > 1. So, that's too much. If we take k₁=2, k₂=3, k₃=7. Sum is 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/7 ≈ 0.5 + 0.333 + 0.142 ≈ 0.975 < 1. So, not enough. What if we take k₁=2, k₂=3, k₃=7, k₄=42. Then sum is 1/2 +1/3 +1/7 +1/42 = 21/42 +14/42 +6/42 +1/42 = 42/42 =1. But here, 42 is divisible by 2,3,7. So, even here, there are divisors. \n\nSo, maybe the key is that in order to reach the sum of reciprocals exactly 1, we must have some numbers where one divides another. Otherwise, if all k_i's are pairwise coprime and none divides another, perhaps the sum is less than 1. But how to formalize this?\n\nAlternatively, consider that if all k_i's are distinct primes, then their reciprocals sum to something, but primes are pairwise coprime. However, the sum of reciprocals of primes diverges, but in finite case, it's finite. For example, primes 2,3,5,7: sum is 1/2 +1/3 +1/5 +1/7 ≈ 0.5 +0.333 +0.2 +0.142 ≈1.175 >1. So, even primes can exceed 1. But if we take 2,3,5,7,11,13,... up to some point, the sum will oscillate. \n\nBut in our problem, the sum is exactly 1. So, perhaps the minimal way to reach sum 1 is to use numbers where some divide others. For instance, using 2,3,6 gives sum 1. If we try to use numbers that are pairwise non-dividing, maybe it's impossible to reach sum exactly 1. \n\nAnother approach: Let's assume for contradiction that no two terms divide each other. That is, all the x_i's are such that none divides another. Then, all the x_i's are distinct divisors of S with that property. \n\nBut how does that affect the sum? Maybe we can use the concept that in the set of divisors of S, the number of non-comparable elements (antichain) is limited. For example, in the set of divisors of S, the maximum size of an antichain (where no two elements divide each other) is equal to the number of divisors in the middle layer(s) of the divisor lattice. For S being a prime power, this would be 1. For composite numbers, it can be larger. \n\nBut perhaps there's a bound that if you have too many divisors that are pairwise non-dividing, their sum would exceed S. Wait, but in our problem, the sum of the x_i's is exactly S. \n\nWait, but each x_i is a divisor of S, so x_i ≤ S. If the x_i's are pairwise non-dividing, then each x_i is at least S divided by some number. For example, if we have two numbers, they must be equal (from the base case). For three numbers, if they are pairwise non-dividing, what can we say? \n\nAlternatively, consider that if all x_i's are distinct and greater than S/2, then there can be at most one such x_i. But in our case, the x_i's can be up to S. \n\nWait, maybe using the idea of unit fractions. If we have multiple reciprocals summing to 1, but with denominators that are not multiples of each other. But I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think differently. Suppose that all the x_i's are divisors of S, and none divides another. Then, each x_i can be expressed as S divided by some integer k_i, where k_i are integers greater than or equal to 1, and none of the k_i divides another. Then, the equation Sum_{i=1 to n} (S / k_i) = S implies Sum_{i=1 to n} 1/k_i = 1. \n\nSo, we have integers k₁, k₂, ..., kₙ ≥ 1, none dividing another, and Sum 1/k_i = 1. If we can show that this is impossible, then we have a contradiction, hence proving that at least two k_i's must have one dividing the other, hence two x_i's have one dividing the other. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to showing that there's no set of integers k₁, ..., kₙ ≥1, pairwise non-dividing, such that the sum of their reciprocals is 1. \n\nTo prove this, let's consider that if k_i's are pairwise non-dividing, then they must be pairwise coprime? No, not necessarily. For example, 6 and 10 are not coprime (gcd=2), but neither divides the other. So, pairwise non-dividing doesn't imply coprime. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use induction on the number of terms. Suppose that for any set of m < n terms with pairwise non-dividing k_i's, the sum of reciprocals is less than 1. Then, adding another term would require the sum to exceed 1. But I need to check this. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the harmonic series. The harmonic series diverges, but here we have only a finite number of terms. However, we can have different combinations. \n\nSuppose we have k₁, k₂, ..., k_n all greater than 1. Then, their reciprocals sum to at most n/2. If n=2, the maximum sum is 1/2 +1/3 ≈0.833 <1. Wait, but if k₁=1, then 1/k₁=1, and sum is 1. But if we allow k_i=1, then x_i=S/1=S, so S must divide S, which is trivial, but then all other x_j's must divide S, but if x_i=S, then the other terms would have to sum to zero, which is impossible since they are positive integers. Hence, k_i=1 is impossible because x_i=S, leading to sum S = x₁ + ... + xₙ ≥ x_i = S, so all other x_j's must be zero, which contradicts the fact that they are positive integers. Therefore, all k_i's must be ≥2. \n\nSo, all k_i's are integers ≥2, pairwise non-dividing, and Sum 1/k_i =1. \n\nLet's try to find such a set. For example:\n\nTake k₁=2, k₂=3, k₃=6. But 6 is divisible by 2 and 3, so they do divide others. So, invalid.\n\nTake k₁=2, k₂=3, k₃=4. Sum is 1/2 +1/3 +1/4 = 13/12 >1. So, exceeds 1. If we take k₁=2, k₂=3, k₃=7. Sum is 1/2 +1/3 +1/7 ≈0.5+0.333+0.142≈0.975 <1. \n\nIf we add another term, say k₄=43. Then sum is ~0.975 +0.023≈0.998 <1. Still less. Not enough. \n\nIf we take larger numbers, the reciprocals get smaller. So, it's hard to reach exactly 1. \n\nAlternatively, take k₁=2, k₂=3, k₃=7, k₄=42. Sum is 1/2 +1/3 +1/7 +1/42 = (21 +14 +6 +1)/42 =42/42=1. But here, 42 is divisible by 2,3,7. So, violates the pairwise non-dividing. \n\nAnother example: k₁=3, k₂=4, k₃=5. Sum is 1/3 +1/4 +1/5 = 47/60 ≈0.783. If we add k₄=6, sum becomes ~0.783 +0.167=0.95. Still less. If we add k₅=20, sum ~0.95 +0.05=1. But 20 is divisible by 4 and 5. \n\nAlternatively, k₁=2, k₂=3, k₃=4, k₄=5, k₅=6, k₆=7, etc. But adding more terms makes the sum larger, but unless we use small denominators. \n\nWait, but all denominators must be at least 2. The maximum sum for n terms is n/2. So, to reach 1, n must be at least 2. For n=2, max sum is 1/2 +1/3≈0.833. For n=3, max is 1/2 +1/3 +1/4≈1.083. Wait, but the maximum sum for n=3 can exceed 1. But if the denominators are pairwise non-dividing, can they still sum to 1?\n\nFor example, take k₁=2, k₂=3, k₃=4. Sum is 1/2 +1/3 +1/4 =13/12 >1. But 4 is divisible by 2, so invalid. So, if we avoid divisors, maybe take k₁=3, k₂=4, k₃=5. Sum is 1/3 +1/4 +1/5≈0.783 <1. Not enough. \n\nIf we take k₁=2, k₂=5, k₃=5. Wait, but they have to be distinct? The problem states \"positive integers\", but doesn't say distinct. So, can we have duplicates? In the original problem, the sequence can have repeated terms. However, if there are duplicates, say two 5's, then each divides the sum, but also each 5 divides the other 5. So, in that case, the conclusion holds. \n\nTherefore, if we allow duplicates, then having duplicates immediately gives two terms where one divides the other. So, the only non-trivial case is when all terms are distinct. \n\nSo, assuming all x_i are distinct, then their corresponding k_i's are also distinct (since x_i = S/k_i, and S is fixed). So, if all x_i are distinct, then all k_i's are distinct. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to: If k₁, k₂, ..., kₙ are distinct integers ≥2, none dividing another, then the sum of their reciprocals cannot be 1. \n\nTherefore, to prove the original problem, it's sufficient to show that such a set of k_i's cannot exist. Hence, by contradiction, in any such set with sum 1, there must be at least two k_i's where one divides the other. \n\nSo, how to show this? Maybe by induction on the number of terms. \n\nBase case: n=2. The only possible k₁ and k₂ are 2 and 3, sum 1/2 +1/3=5/6 <1. So, cannot reach 1. Hence, no solution. Therefore, for n=2, the sum cannot be 1. Wait, but in the original problem, n=2 requires that x₁ and x₂ both divide S=x₁+x₂. Which as the user showed, implies x₁ divides x₂ and x₂ divides x₁, hence x₁=x₂. Therefore, even though the k_i's would be equal (since S=2x₁, so k₁=k₂=2), but in this case, the terms are equal, so one divides the other. Hence, the base case holds. \n\nWait, but if x₁=x₂, then they are equal, so each divides the other. So, the conclusion holds. \n\nNow, for n=3. Suppose we have three distinct k_i's ≥2, none dividing another, such that their reciprocals sum to 1. Let's see if this is possible. \n\nTake k₁=2, k₂=3, k₃=6. Sum is 1/2 +1/3 +1/6 =1. But 6 is divisible by 2 and 3. So, violates the non-dividing condition. \n\nIf we take k₁=3, k₂=4, k₃=5. Sum is ~0.783 <1. If we take k₁=2, k₂=3, k₃=7. Sum ~0.975 <1. If we add another term, say k₄=43, sum ~0.975 +0.023≈0.998 <1. Still not enough. \n\nAlternatively, take k₁=2, k₂=3, k₃=7, k₄=42. Sum=1, but 42 is divisible by 2,3,7. \n\nSo, it seems that whenever the sum of reciprocals reaches 1, there must be some denominators that divide others. \n\nBut how to formalize this? Maybe by considering that if you have a set of numbers where none divides another, then each number must be greater than the previous one multiplied by some factor. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, think about the largest k_i. Let's say the largest k_i is K. Since all k_i's are distinct and none divides another, then none of them can be factors of K. But K is the largest, so all other k_i's must be less than K and not divide K. Therefore, they must be coprime with K? Not necessarily. For example, K=6, other k_i's can be 4 and 10, which do not divide 6 but are not coprime. \n\nBut perhaps we can bound the sum. If K is the largest denominator, then the sum of reciprocals is at most (n-1)/2 +1/K. Because all other k_i's are less than K and none divide K, so they are at least 2. Wait, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, suppose the largest denominator is K. Then, all other denominators are ≤ K/2, because if there is a denominator d such that K/2 < d < K, then since d does not divide K, but K must not be divisible by d. However, such a d could exist. For example, K=7, d=5. But 5 does not divide 7. \n\nBut even so, the sum of reciprocals would be 1/K plus the sum of terms each ≤1/2. But this is vague. \n\nAlternatively, maybe use induction. Assume that for any set of m <n numbers, the sum of reciprocals is <1. Then for n numbers, the sum would be ≤ sum_{i=1 to n-1}1/k_i +1/K, where K is larger than all previous k_i's. But this doesn't necessarily help. \n\nAnother angle: Egyptian fractions. The problem resembles expressing 1 as an Egyptian fraction with denominators that are pairwise non-dividing. But known results in Egyptian fractions don't directly address this. \n\nAlternatively, consider that the product of all k_i's must be a multiple of the least common multiple of the k_i's. If the k_i's are pairwise non-dividing, then the LCM is their product. So, LCM(k₁,...,kₙ)=k₁k₂...kₙ. Then, the product is large, but how does this relate to the sum of reciprocals? \n\nAlternatively, consider that if we have pairwise non-dividing k_i's, then each k_i has at least one prime factor not shared by the others. But this isn't necessarily true. For example, 6 and 10 share the factor 2, but neither divides the other. \n\nWait, but if two numbers share a common prime factor, but neither divides the other, then they are not coprime but still non-dividing. \n\nThis seems too vague. Maybe another approach. \n\nSuppose we have k₁ <k₂ <... <kₙ. Since none of the k_i's divides another, then each k_i must have a prime factor not present in any of the previous k_j's. Wait, no. For example, 4 and 6: 4=2², 6=2×3. 4 doesn't divide 6 and vice versa. So, they share the prime factor 2, but neither divides the other. \n\nAlternatively, each k_i must have a prime factor that is not present in any of the k_j's for j<i. But this isn't necessarily the case. \n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way. \n\nLet me think back to the original problem. Suppose we have x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ, each dividing S. Assume for contradiction that no x_i divides another. Then, each x_i is a divisor of S, but none divides another. \n\nConsider the set of divisors of S. If we pick divisors such that none divides another, the maximum size of such a set is called the width of the divisor lattice, which is equal to the number of divisors of S that are of the form p^{⌊k/2⌋}, where p is prime. But this might not help. \n\nAlternatively, if S has prime factorization p₁^{a₁}p₂^{a₂}...p_m^{a_m}, then the maximum antichain size is the product of the floor((a_i +1)/2) +1 terms. Not sure. \n\nBut maybe instead of focusing on S, consider that if all x_i's are divisors of S, and none divides another, then their sum S must be at least as large as the sum of the first n divisors of S that form an antichain. \n\nBut this seems too vague. \n\nAlternatively, consider the minimal S that can have n divisors forming an antichain. For example, if S is the least common multiple of the x_i's. But if the x_i's are pairwise non-dividing, then LCM(x₁,...,xₙ)=product(x_i's). Which is large. Then, the sum of the x_i's is S. So, product(x_i's) = LCM(x_i's) = S. But sum(x_i's) = S. So, sum(x_i's) = product(x_i's). \n\nBut for x_i's ≥2, the product is at least 2^n, and the sum is n×something. For example, if all x_i's are 2, sum is 2n, product is 2^n. But 2n <2^n for n≥3. So, unless the x_i's are larger. \n\nWait, but in our case, the x_i's are divisors of S, and they sum to S. So, if S is the product of the x_i's, then sum(x_i's)=product(x_i's). This seems only possible if all but one x_i is 1. But x_i's are positive integers, and they divide S=product(x_i's). But if one x_i is 1, then S=1×other terms. But 1 divides S, which is okay. But other terms must divide S. However, if we have multiple terms greater than 1, the product would be much larger than the sum. \n\nFor example, x₁=1, x₂=2, x₃=3. Then S=1+2+3=6. The product is 6, which equals S. Here, x₁=1 divides everyone, x₂=2 divides 6, x₃=3 divides 6. But x₁=1 divides all, so there's a term that divides others. Hence, this case doesn't violate the conclusion. \n\nAnother example: x₁=2, x₂=3. Sum S=5. But 2 doesn't divide 5, so this is invalid. \n\nWait, in the problem, each x_i must divide S. So, if we have x₁=2, x₂=3, then S=5, but 2 doesn't divide 5, so this is not allowed. \n\nSo, the only way to have x_i's that are pairwise non-dividing and each divides S is if S is a common multiple of all x_i's, and none of the x_i's divide each other. But how can this happen? \n\nFor example, take S=6, and x₁=2, x₂=3. Then, sum S=5, which is not 6. So, invalid. \n\nWait, correct example: Let S=6. If x₁=2, x₂=3, then sum is 5, not 6. If x₁=2, x₂=3, x₃=1. Sum=6. Then, 1 divides everyone, so conclusion holds. \n\nAnother example: S=12. Let x₁=4, x₂=6. Sum=10, not 12. Add x₃=2, sum=12. But 2 divides 4 and 6, so conclusion holds. \n\nAnother try: S=30. Suppose x₁=6, x₂=10, x₃=15. Each divides 30. Their sum is 6+10+15=31≠30. Doesn't work. If we take x₁=5, x₂=6, x₃=10. Sum=21≠30. \n\nIt's challenging to find such a set where the sum equals S, and none of the terms divide each other. \n\nThis suggests that such a set might not exist, hence proving the original statement. Therefore, by contradiction, there must be at least two terms where one divides the other. \n\nTo formalize this, assume that there exists a set of numbers x₁,...,xₙ each dividing S=x₁+...+xₙ, and no two x_i's divide each other. Then, we derive a contradiction by analyzing the properties of such a set. \n\nOne possible contradiction is that the sum of their reciprocals (in terms of k_i's) cannot be 1 if all k_i's are pairwise non-dividing. \n\nAlternatively, consider that if all x_i's are at least 2, then the sum S must be at least 2n. But each x_i divides S, so S must be a multiple of each x_i. Hence, S must be at least the least common multiple (LCM) of the x_i's. However, if the x_i's are pairwise non-dividing, the LCM is their product. So, S ≥ product(x_i's). But product(x_i's) ≥2^n, while sum S=sum(x_i's) ≤n×S. Wait, this doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, LCM(x₁,...,xₙ) ≤ product(x_i's). But if the x_i's are pairwise non-dividing, LCM(x_i's) is at least the product of the smallest primes. For example, if x_i's are pairwise coprime, LCM is product. But pairwise non-dividing doesn't imply coprime. \n\nThis seems too vague. Maybe we can use induction. \n\nAssume that for any set of m <n terms, the statement holds. Now, take n terms. Consider the minimal x_i. Let it be x₁. Since x₁ divides S, S=kx₁. Then, all other x_i's must divide S=kx₁. Suppose none of the x_i's divides another. Then, each x_i (i≥2) must be a divisor of kx₁ but not a divisor of x₁. Hence, each x_i must be a multiple of some prime factor of k. \n\nBut this is getting too abstract. Maybe instead, consider the following: \n\nLet x be the smallest term. Then, x divides S, so S = x * m for some integer m. All other terms divide S, so each term is a divisor of x*m. Since x is the smallest term, and x divides S, all other terms must be multiples of x or divisors of x*m. But if they are divisors of x*m, and none of them divides another, then they must be multiples of x but not multiples of each other. \n\nWait, for example, let x=2. Then S=2m. Other terms must divide 2m. Suppose we have another term y=2a, which divides 2m, so a divides m. Similarly, another term z=2b, divides 2m, so b divides m. If none of the terms divide each other, then a and b must not divide each other. So, the terms would be 2, 2a, 2b, etc., where a and b divide m and are pairwise non-dividing. \n\nBut the sum S=2m=2 +2a +2b +... So, m=1 +a +b +... Since a and b divide m, we have a divides 1 +a +b +..., which seems restrictive. \n\nFor example, let x=2, then m=1 +a +b. a divides m=1+a+b. So, a divides 1 +b. Similarly, b divides m=1 +a +b, so b divides 1 +a. \n\nIf a and b are both 1, then m=1+1+1=3, S=6. Terms are 2,2,2. But they divide each other. \n\nIf a=2, then m=1+2 +b. So, 2 divides 1+2 +b → 2 divides 3 +b → b must be odd. Also, b divides m=3 +b. So, b divides 3 +b → b divides 3. Since b is odd and divides 3, possible b=1 or 3. \n\nIf b=1, then m=1+2+1=4, S=8. Terms are 2,4,2. But 2 divides 4 and 2, so invalid. \n\nIf b=3, then m=1+2+3=6, S=12. Terms are 2,4,6. But 2 divides 4 and 6, so invalid. \n\nAlternatively, take a=3. Then m=1+3 +b=4 +b. 3 divides 4 +b → b ≡2 mod3. Also, b divides 4 +b → b divides 4. Possible b=1,2,4. \n\nIf b=1, m=5. Then terms are 2,6,2. Again, duplicates. \n\nIf b=2, m=6. Terms are 2,6,4. 2 divides 4 and 6. \n\nIf b=4, m=8. Terms are 2,6,8. Again, 2 divides 6 and 8. \n\nSo, in every case, the smallest term x=2 leads to other terms that are multiples of x, hence x divides them. Therefore, the conclusion holds. \n\nThis suggests that if we take the smallest term x, then all other terms must be multiples of x (since S is a multiple of x, and each term divides S). But wait, if x is the smallest term and divides S, then each term x_i must be a divisor of S, but not necessarily a multiple of x. For example, S=30, x=2. Then, x_i could be 3, which divides 30 but is not a multiple of 2. But in that case, x=2 and x_j=3 both divide S=30. But then, if there are terms like 2,3,5, etc., their sum must be 30. But 2+3+5=10, which is less than 30. To reach 30, you would need more terms, but adding terms like 6 (multiple of 2 and 3), which would be divisible by 2 or 3. \n\nThis seems to suggest that the only way to have the sum S be a multiple of each term is to have at least one term that is a multiple of the smallest term. Hence, the smallest term divides another term. \n\nTherefore, the key idea is that the smallest term x divides S, and since the other terms divide S, at least one of them must be a multiple of x. Otherwise, the sum cannot be a multiple of x. \n\nWait, this is a crucial point. Let's elaborate. \n\nLet x be the smallest term. Then, x divides S. The sum of all terms S is x + sum of other terms. Since x divides S, then x must divide the sum of the other terms. Because S = x + (sum of other terms), so sum of other terms = S -x. Since x divides S, x divides (S -x), which implies x divides sum of other terms. \n\nBut sum of other terms is a sum of positive integers each ≥x (since x is the smallest). If all other terms are ≥x and none is divisible by x, then their sum mod x would be congruent to the sum of each term mod x. Since each term is not divisible by x, each term mod x is at least 1. If there are at least two other terms, then sum mod x would be at least 2, but x divides the sum of other terms, which requires the sum to be ≡0 mod x. Contradiction. \n\nWait, this seems promising. Let's formalize it. \n\nLet x be the smallest term. Then, sum of other terms = S -x. Since x divides S, x divides sum of other terms. Now, each of the other terms is ≥x (since x is the smallest). If none of the other terms is divisible by x, then each of them is congruent to some integer from 1 to x-1 modulo x. Therefore, the sum of the other terms modulo x is the sum of their congruences modulo x. Since there are (n-1) terms, each contributing at least 1 modulo x, the total sum modulo x is at least (n-1). But since x divides the sum of other terms, the sum modulo x must be 0. Therefore, (n-1) ≤0 mod x, which implies that (n-1) ≡0 mod x. But x is at least 1, but in reality, since x is a positive integer divisor of S, x ≥1. However, x is the smallest term, and all terms are positive integers, so x ≥1. \n\nBut if x=1, then all terms are 1, because each term divides S, and sum S would be the number of terms. But if all terms are 1, then they all divide each other. So, the conclusion holds. \n\nIf x≥2, then the sum of other terms modulo x is at least (n-1). For this to be ≡0 mod x, we must have (n-1) ≥x. But x is the smallest term, and sum of other terms is S -x. But if x ≥2, and n-1 ≥x, but the sum of other terms is at least x*(n-1) (since each is ≥x). But S =x + sum of other terms ≥x +x*(n-1)=x*n. \n\nBut S is also the sum of all terms, which is x + sum of other terms ≥x +x*(n-1)=x*n. But S must be a multiple of x, so S =x*m for some m ≥n. \n\nHowever, each term divides S=x*m. The other terms are at least x, and none are divisible by x. Therefore, each other term must divide x*m but not divisible by x. Hence, each other term must divide m. Because if a term y divides x*m and y is not divisible by x, then y must divide m. \n\nTherefore, the other terms are divisors of m. Since m ≥n, and the other terms are divisors of m. The sum of the other terms is S -x =x*m -x =x(m-1). But the sum of the other terms is also equal to the sum of divisors of m. \n\nWait, this is getting too convoluted. Let's backtrack. \n\nKey point: If x is the smallest term, then sum of other terms = S -x must be divisible by x. If none of the other terms is divisible by x, then each other term ≡1 to x-1 mod x. So their sum ≡ sum of residues mod x. If there are k other terms, sum ≡k mod x. For this to be ≡0 mod x, k must be ≡0 mod x. So, the number of other terms must be a multiple of x. \n\nBut the number of other terms is n-1. So, x must divide n-1. \n\nBut x is the smallest term, which is at least 1. If x=1, then all terms are 1, which trivially satisfy the condition. If x≥2, then x divides n-1. \n\nBut even if x divides n-1, we still have the sum of other terms being S -x =x(m-1). But the other terms are divisors of m (since they divide x*m and are not divisible by x). And the sum of those divisors must equal x(m-1). \n\nBut this is very restrictive. For example, suppose x=2, so n-1 must be divisible by 2. Let n-1=2, so n=3. Then, sum of other terms =2(m-1). The other terms are two divisors of m. So, m must have two divisors that sum to 2(m-1). \n\nLet’s try m=3. Then sum of other terms=2*(3-1)=4. The two divisors of 3 are 1 and 3. Sum=1+3=4. But these terms would be 1 and 3. But the smallest term is x=2, which contradicts because 1 is smaller than 2. So, invalid. \n\nNext m=4. Sum of other terms=2*(4-1)=6. Divisors of 4 are 1,2,4. But we need two divisors of 4 that sum to 6. 2+4=6. So, the other terms are 2 and 4. But x=2 is the smallest term, and the other terms are 2 and 4. But 2 divides 4, so contradicts the assumption that none divide each other. \n\nNext m=5. Sum=2*(5-1)=8. Divisors of 5 are 1,5. Sum=1+5=6≠8. Not possible. \n\nm=6. Sum=2*5=10. Divisors of 6 are 1,2,3,6. We need two divisors that sum to 10. 4+6=10, but 4 isn't a divisor. 6+4 invalid. 3+7 invalid. So, impossible. \n\nThis suggests that for x=2 and n=3, there's no valid m. Hence, the assumption leads to a contradiction. Therefore, in this case, there must be a term divisible by x=2. \n\nSimilarly, for higher x, the conditions become even more restrictive. Therefore, the initial assumption that no two terms divide each other leads to a contradiction. Hence, there must be at least two terms where one divides the other. \n\nThis line of reasoning seems valid. Therefore, the key step is that the smallest term x must divide the sum of the other terms, which are all ≥x. If none of them is divisible by x, then their sum modulo x would be at least the number of terms, which must be congruent to 0 modulo x, leading to the number of other terms being a multiple of x. However, this is highly restrictive and leads to contradictions in practice, implying that there must be at least one term divisible by x, hence proving the existence of two terms where one divides the other.",
