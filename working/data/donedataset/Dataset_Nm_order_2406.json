    "Content": "In my calculus class, to show that $\\frac{d}{dx}e^x=e^x$ we did something like this: $$\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{a^{x+h} - a^x}{h} = a^x \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{a^h-1} h,$$ and then we defined $e$ to be the base $a$ that makes the limit $$\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{a^h-1}{h}$$ equal to $1$. Now, my question is this: how can we know beforehand that the function which is its own derivative is an exponential function? In other words, if we have $$ \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} = f(x),$$ how do we know $f(x)$ is of the form $ka^x$ (ignoring the trivial case $f(x) = 0$)? How can we show that there aren't functions of other forms that give the same result?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "OK, so we are given the differential equation\n$$f'(x)=f(x) \\tag{1}$$\nOf course this implies that $f$ is differentiable. Let's first make the observation that whenever $f(x)$ is a solution to this differential equation, then for arbitrary $s,c\\in\\mathbb R$,\n$$g(x) = s\\,f(x-c) \\tag{2}$$\nis also a solution. Let's further have a look at the general form the solutions may have. If at some $x$, $f(x)>0$, then due to continuity we have $f(x)>0$ in some neighbourhood. Since $f'(x)=f(x)$ this also implies that $f(x)$ is monotonously growing in that neighbourhood. Clearly if it is positive and growing, it cannot reach $0$ for any larger value of $x$. Analogously, if it is anywhere negative, it will remain negative for all larger $x$. Thus we have by now restricted the possible solutions to functions of one of the following types: Either the function is everywhere strictly positive and monotonously growing. Or the function is zero up for all $x\\le x_0$, and strictly positive for all $x>x_0$ (at $x_0$ if has to be $0$ due to continuity, as a limit from the left must reproduce the function value). Or the function is zero everywhere. Or the function is the negative of one of the first two types. Of course the constant function $f(x)=0$ is one solution of $(1)$. If there are other solutions, there must be at least one $x$ so that $f(x)\\ne 0$. Because of $(2)$ we can thus assume wlog that $f(0)=1$. Also, for convenience, define for the first case $x_0=-\\infty$. Now assume $f(x)\\ne 0$. Then $f(x+1)/f(x)$ is well defined in a neighbourhood, and we have\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\mathrm d}{\\mathrm dx}\\,\\frac{f(x+1)}{f(x)}\n&= \\frac{f(x)f'(x+1) - f(x+1)f'(x)}{f(x)^2}\\\\\n&= \\frac{f(x)f(x+1) - f(x+1)f(x)}{f(x)^2} = 0\\tag{3}\n\\end{align}\nIn other words, $f(x+1)/f(x)$ is a constant. This holds for all $x>x_0$. So since we have assumed that $f(0)=1$, we have $f(1)=f(0+1)=af(0)=a$, $f(2)=a(1+1)=af(1)=a^2$. Also, assuming $x_0<-1$, $af(-1)=f(0)$, so $f(-1)=a^{-1}$ etc. Or in short, for any $n\\in\\mathbb Z$ with $n>x_0$, $f(n)=a^n$. But then, in $(3)$, instead of $f(x+1)$ we could have used $f(x+1/k)$ with the same result, giving $f(n/k)=b^n$. For $n=k$, we thus get $a = f(1) = f(k/k) = b^k$, that is, $b=a^{1/k}$. So in summary, we have for all $q\\in\\mathbb Q$ with $q>x_0$ that $f(q)=a^q$. But since $f$ is differentiable, it is in particular continuous, and thus determined by its values at rational points. And since $a^x$ is continuous, too, we get $f(x)=a^x$ for all $x\\in\\mathbb R$ with $x>x_0$. Continuity of $a^x$ then also implies $\\lim_{x\\to x_0+0}f(x) = \\lim_{x\\to x_0+0}a^x = a^{x_0}$. However since by assumption $f(x)$ is continuous, $\\lim_{x\\to x_0+0}f(x) = f(x_0)$. But we previously have seen, also by continuity, that $f(x_0)=0$. Since the equation $0=a^{x_0}$ has no solution in $\\mathbb R$, this means that the second case cannot apply, and the function therefore is strictly positive everywhere, and thus is $a^x$ everywhere. In other words, the function is an exponential function.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about showing that a function which is its own derivative must be exponential. The user wants me to extract the assumptions and state the problem clearly.\n\nFirst, I need to read through the Math Stack Exchange question carefully. The user mentions that in their calculus class, they showed the derivative of e^x by using the limit definition and defining e as the base that makes the limit equal to 1. Then they ask how we can know that such a function must be exponential, excluding the zero function.\n\nSo, the main problem here is to prove that if a function satisfies f'(x) = f(x) for all x, then f(x) must be of the form ka^x. The assumptions would include the conditions given in the problem. Let's break them down.\n\nThe key assumptions here are:\n1. The function f is differentiable everywhere (since the derivative is defined as a limit).\n2. The derivative of f at any point x is equal to f(x) itself.\n3. We are excluding the trivial solution f(x) = 0.\n\nEach assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. So, the first assumption is about the differentiability of f. The second is about the derivative condition. The third is excluding the zero function. These are separate points.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the assumptions would be listed line by line, and the problem statement is to show that such a function must be exponential.",
