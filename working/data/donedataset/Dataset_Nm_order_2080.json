    "AcceptedAnswer": "Suppose $S^n = X \\times Y$, where $X$ and $Y$ are arbitrary topological spaces (that are homotopy-equivalent to CW complexes).  With integer coefficients, there is the (unnaturally) split Kunneth sexseq $0 \\rightarrow \\bigoplus_i (H_i(X) \\otimes H_{m-i}(Y)) \\rightarrow H_m(X \\times Y) \\rightarrow \\bigoplus_i \\mbox{Tor}(H_i(X),H_{m-i-1}(Y)) \\rightarrow 0$. Clearly $X$ and $Y$ must be path-connected since $\\pi_0$ takes products to products (and obviously we should assume $n \\geq 1$), so $H_0(X) = H_0(Y)=\\mathbb{Z}$.  Since $-\\otimes \\mathbb{Z}$ does nothing to an abelian group, this means that we're getting a copy of $H_*(X)$ in $H_*(X\\times Y)$ from the inclusion above when it's tensored against $H_0(Y)$, and similarly for $H_*(Y)$.  Moreover, all the homology of $S^n$ must come from the inclusions in the above sexseq, since $\\mbox{Tor}$ always consists entirely of torsion.  So without loss of generality, $H_*(X) \\cong H_*(S^n)$ and $H_*(Y) \\cong H_*(\\mbox{pt})$.  Since $\\pi_1$ takes products to products, both $X$ and $Y$ are simply-connected.  So the projection $S^n =X \\times Y \\rightarrow X$ is a homology isomorphism of simply-connected spaces and hence is a (weak) homotopy equivalence, while $Y$ is a simply-connected space with trivial integral homology so it must be (weakly) contractible.  Thus the factorization $S^n = X \\times Y$ is trivial.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example they provided involved an algebraic expression and divisibility, but this new problem is about topology, specifically decomposing a sphere as a product space. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question from Math Stack Exchange. The title is \"Decomposing the sphere as a product,\" and the question states: It seems obvious that, if the sphere \\( S^n \\) is homeomorphic to a product \\( X \\times Y \\) of topological spaces, then either \\( X \\) or \\( Y \\) is a point. How can one prove that?\n\nMy task is to extract the assumptions and the problem statement in the required format. Let me recall the example they gave. The assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. In the example, the assumptions were that \\( n \\) is an integer and that \\( n \\) is divisible by 7. Then the problem was to prove the divisibility of the expression by 91.\n\nNow, applying this to the topology problem. The problem is about a sphere \\( S^n \\) being homeomorphic to a product \\( X \\times Y \\). The conclusion is that one of the factors must be a point. So, the assumptions here are:\n\n1. \\( S^n \\) is a sphere (specifically, the n-dimensional sphere).\n2. \\( X \\times Y \\) is a product of topological spaces.\n3. There exists a homeomorphism between \\( S^n \\) and \\( X \\times Y \\).\n\nBut wait, the original problem doesn't state any additional assumptions beyond the given setup. The user is asking to prove that if such a decomposition exists, then one of the spaces must be a point. The key assumptions here are inherent in the problem statement: the sphere is homeomorphic to a product, and we need to show that one of the factors is a singleton.\n\nHowever, the example included specific conditions (like n being an integer and divisible by 7), but in this case, the problem is more general. The sphere \\( S^n \\) is given, and the product decomposition is the main condition. Therefore, the assumptions should capture the conditions given in the problem. Let me list them:\n\nAssumption:\n- \\( S^n \\) is a sphere.\n- \\( X \\times Y \\) is a product of topological spaces.\n- \\( S^n \\) is homeomorphic to \\( X \\times Y \\).\n\nBut each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. Let me rephrase:\n\n1. \\( S^n \\) is a topological space (the n-dimensional sphere).\n2. \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\) are topological spaces.\n3. There exists a homeomorphism between \\( S^n \\) and \\( X \\times Y \\).\n\nWait, the problem doesn't explicitly state that \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\) are topological spaces, but since the context is about homeomorphisms and products in topology, it's implicit. However, to follow the example, perhaps each assumption should be as specific as possible. The original problem says \"if the sphere \\( S^n \\) is homeomorphic to a product \\( X \\times Y \\) of topological spaces,\" so the key conditions are:\n\n- \\( S^n \\) is homeomorphic to \\( X \\times Y \\).\n- \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\) are topological spaces.\n\nBut the example had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- \\( S^n \\) is a sphere.\n- \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\) are topological spaces.\n- \\( S^n \\) is homeomorphic to \\( X \\times Y \\).\n\nBut each assumption should apply to one object. So:\n\n1. \\( S^n \\) is a sphere.\n2. \\( X \\) is a topological space.\n3. \\( Y \\) is a topological space.\n4. \\( S^n \\) is homeomorphic to \\( X \\times Y \\).\n\nBut the problem states \"if the sphere \\( S^n \\) is homeomorphic to a product \\( X \\times Y \\) of topological spaces,\" so perhaps the key assumptions are that \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\) are topological spaces forming a product homeomorphic to \\( S^n \\). So the problem's assumptions would be:\n\n- \\( X \\) is a topological space.\n- \\( Y \\) is a topological space.\n- \\( S^n \\) is homeomorphic to \\( X \\times Y \\).\n\nBut the sphere being a sphere is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Wait, the problem is to prove that if \\( S^n \\) is homeomorphic to \\( X \\times Y \\), then one of \\( X \\) or \\( Y \\) is a point. Therefore, the assumptions are the conditions under which the conclusion must hold. So the problem starts with the assumption that \\( S^n \\cong X \\times Y \\), where \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\) are topological spaces, and the conclusion is that one of them is a point.\n\nTherefore, in the \"Assumption\" section, we need to list the conditions given in the problem. Let me check the example again: the problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91, given that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So the assumptions were the conditions given (n is integer, n divisible by 7). Similarly, here the problem gives that S^n is homeomorphic to X×Y, where X and Y are topological spaces. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- \\( S^n \\) is homeomorphic to \\( X \\times Y \\).\n- \\( X \\) is a topological space.\n- \\( Y \\) is a topological space.\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"if the sphere \\( S^n \\) is homeomorphic to a product \\( X \\times Y \\) of topological spaces,\" so the only assumptions are:\n\n1. \\( S^n \\) is homeomorphic to \\( X \\times Y \\).\n2. \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\) are topological spaces.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address only one property applied to one object. Therefore, perhaps:\n\n1. \\( X \\) is a topological space.\n2. \\( Y \\) is a topological space.\n3. \\( S^n \\) is homeomorphic to \\( X \\times Y \\).\n\nAlternatively, since the homeomorphism is between S^n and X×Y, maybe that's a single assumption. But the example split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" into two assumptions, even though both apply to n. So here, maybe:\n\n1. \\( X \\times Y \\) is a product of topological spaces.\n2. \\( S^n \\) is homeomorphic to \\( X \\times Y \\).\n\nBut the problem statement says \"if the sphere \\( S^n \\) is homeomorphic to a product \\( X \\times Y \\) of topological spaces,\" so the product being of topological spaces is part of the condition. Therefore, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\) are topological spaces.\n- \\( S^n \\) is homeomorphic to \\( X \\times Y \\).\n\nBut according to the example's structure, each assumption is a single line addressing one property of one object. Therefore, splitting into:\n\n1. \\( X \\) is a topological space.\n2. \\( Y \\) is a topological space.\n3. \\( S^n \\) is homeomorphic to \\( X \\times Y \\).\n\nThat would be three assumptions. However, in the example, the assumptions were two: n is integer, n divisible by 7. Here, the problem's conditions are that X and Y are topological spaces, and that there's a homeomorphism between S^n and their product. So three lines: one for X being a topological space, one for Y, one for the homeomorphism.\n\nBut maybe in the problem, \"product of topological spaces\" is a single condition. But in the example, the user split the conditions on n into separate lines. So following that, here we should split X and Y into separate lines.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- \\( X \\) is a topological space.\n- \\( Y \\) is a topological space.\n- \\( S^n \\) is homeomorphic to \\( X \\times Y \\).\n\nProblem: Prove that either \\( X \\) or \\( Y \\) is a singleton (i.e., a point).\n\nWait, the original problem states \"either X or Y is a point,\" so the problem is to prove that under the given assumptions, one of the factors is a singleton.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption: \n- \\( X \\) is a topological space.\n- \\( Y \\) is a topological space.\n- \\( S^n \\) is homeomorphic to \\( X \\times Y \\).\n\nProblem: Prove that either \\( X \\) or \\( Y \\) is a point.\n\nBut let me check the example again. In the example, the problem had an expression and the conclusion was about divisibility. Here, the problem is to prove a topological property given certain homeomorphism conditions.\n\nYes, this seems correct. Each assumption is on a separate line, addressing one object or condition. The problem is then stated clearly.",
