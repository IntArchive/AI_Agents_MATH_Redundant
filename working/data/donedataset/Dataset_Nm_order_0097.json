    "Content": "This question is inspired by another one , asking to prove that something approximately equal to $1.2$ is bigger than something approximately equal to $0.9$. The numerical answer to this question was (expectedly) downvoted, though in my opinion it is the most reasonable approach to this kind of problems (${\\tiny \\text{which I personally find completely useless}}$). My question will consist of 2 parts: Prove (without calculator) that $e<\\pi$; Explain what do we learn from the proof/what makes this problem interesting. Edit : Existing answers only confirm my point of view about various weird inequalitites. Fortunately there is $3$ between $e$ and $\\pi$, otherwise the things would be very boring.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Inscribe a regular hexagon in a circle of radius $1$. Since a straight line is the shortest distance between two points the circumference of the circle is longer than the circumference of the hexagon. We take the definition of $\\pi$ as half the circumference of the unit circle. Putting all this together we obtain $2\\pi \\gt 6$ or $\\pi \\gt 3$ We take $e$ as the sum $1+1+\\frac 12+\\frac 1{3!}+\\cdots$ which converges absolutely and which, after the first three terms, is term by term less than the sum $1+1+\\frac 12+\\frac 1{2^2}+\\cdots$ since the later terms in the second sum are obtained by dividing the previous term by $2$, and in the first sum by $n\\gt 2$ (crudely for $n\\ge 3$ we have $n!\\gt 2^{n-1}$). Summing the geometric series we have $e\\lt 3 \\lt\\pi$. What do we learn - well how easy it is to make an estimate depends on the definition. The geometric definition of $\\pi$ lends itself to a good enough estimate. There are different ways of defining $e$ too, but the sum offers a range of possibilities for estimating, particularly as the terms decrease very quickly. But the geometric definition for $\\pi$ requires assumed knowledge about a straight line as the shortest distance between two points, which seems obvious - yet conceals the trickiness of defining the length of a curve - so this looks simpler than it is.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, I need to structure this Math Stack Exchange question according to the given format. Let me start by reading the original problem carefully. The user is asking two parts: first to prove without a calculator that e is less than π, and second to explain what we learn from the proof or why the problem is interesting. They also mention that existing answers confirm their view about weird inequalities and note that 3 is between e and π.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The example given had assumptions each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. In this case, the problem is to prove e < π without a calculator. So, possible assumptions could relate to the definitions of e and π, but the problem doesn't specify any particular conditions or constraints beyond not using a calculator. However, the user mentions \"prove without calculator,\" which is a condition on the method of proof. So the assumption here would be that the proof must not use a calculator. Also, since e and π are mathematical constants, there's an implicit assumption that they are the standard constants (Euler's number and the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter).\n\nWait, but the example had assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" Here, the key constraint is the prohibition of calculator use. Maybe the user is assuming standard definitions of e and π. Let me check if there are any other implicit assumptions. The problem is straightforward: compare e and π without computational tools. So the main assumption is the method restriction. The problem itself is to prove e < π under that condition.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- The proof must not use a calculator.\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm.\n- π is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter.\n\nWait, but the example only listed explicit conditions given in the problem. The original problem here doesn't state any assumptions about e and π other than their standard definitions. Maybe the key assumption here is just the first one about not using a calculator. The problem is to prove the inequality, and the constraint is the method. The other part is explaining the significance. But according to the format, the \"Assumption\" section should list all the problem's conditions. Since the problem says \"prove without calculator,\" that's the main assumption. The definitions of e and π are standard, but maybe the user assumes that the prover knows their definitions. However, in the example, the assumptions were about the variables in the problem (n is integer, etc.). Here, the variables are the constants e and π, but their definitions are not part of the assumptions unless necessary. So perhaps the only explicit assumption is the \"no calculator\" part.\n\nBut maybe I should check the original problem again. The user wrote: \"Prove (without calculator) that e < π; Explain what do we learn from the proof/what makes this problem interesting.\" So the key assumption is the first part: proving without a calculator. The rest is the problem statement. Therefore, the Assumption section should include that the proof must not use a calculator. The problem is to prove e < π and explain the significance.\n\nBut in the example, the assumption included both the domain of n (integer) and a divisibility condition. Here, the problem's only explicit condition is the \"without calculator\" part. So the Assumption would be that the proof is done without a calculator. However, maybe there's an implicit assumption that e and π are the standard mathematical constants. But since they are universally defined, perhaps that's not necessary. But to be thorough, maybe include both.\n\nAlternatively, the example didn't list the definitions of the numbers involved, only the conditions on the variable n. So perhaps here, the only assumption is the \"without calculator\" method. The problem is to prove the inequality under that constraint.\n\nSo, structuring:\n\nAssumption:\nThe proof must not use a calculator.\n\nProblem:\nProve that \\( e < \\pi \\). Explain what we learn from the proof or what makes this problem interesting.\n\nBut wait, the original problem has two parts: proving the inequality and explaining the significance. The format example had the problem part as a single statement. Should both parts be included in the Problem section? The user's instruction says to structure the problem as per the format, which includes the problem statement. The example included the problem as a single statement. So in this case, the problem would be both parts: prove e < π without a calculator and explain the significance. However, the example's problem was a single statement. The user's original problem has two parts, so the Problem section should include both.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe proof must not use a calculator.\n\nProblem:\nProve that \\( e < \\pi \\) without using a calculator. Explain what is learned from the proof or what makes this problem interesting.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"Prove (without calculator) that e < π; Explain...\" So the first part's method is specified, and the second part is a separate instruction. However, the example's problem section included the entire problem statement. So maybe the Problem section here should capture both tasks as part of the problem. The assumption is the \"without calculator\" part. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nThe proof must not use a calculator.\n\nProblem:\nProve that \\( e < \\pi \\). Explain what is learned from the proof or what makes this problem interesting.\n\nBut in the original problem, the user mentions that existing answers confirm their view about \"various weird inequalities,\" and that 3 is between e and π. However, that's part of the question's context, not the problem's assumptions. The user's actual problem is the two parts: prove and explain. The assumption is just the \"without calculator\" part. So the formatted problem would have the assumption as the restriction on method, and the problem includes both parts.\n\nI think that's correct. The example had assumptions listed as conditions on the variables, here the assumption is a condition on the method. So the final answer should be structured accordingly.",
