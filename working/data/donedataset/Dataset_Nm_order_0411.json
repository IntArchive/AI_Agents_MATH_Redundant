    "Content": "Please correct any mistakes in this proof and, if you're feeling inclined, please provide a better one where \"better\" is defined by whatever criteria you prefer. Assume $2^{1/2}$ is irrational. $2^{1/3} * 2^{x} = 2^{1/2} \\Rightarrow x = 1/6$. $2^{1/3} * {2^{1/2}}^{1/3} = 2^{1/2}$. if $2^{1/2}$ is irrational, then ${2^{1/2}}^{1/3}$ is irrational. $2^{1/3} = 2^{1/2} / {2^{1/2}}^{1/3}$. $2^{1/3}$ equals an irrational number divided by an irrational number. $2^{1/3}$ is an irrational number.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Just use the rational root test on the polynomial equation $x^3-2=0$ (note that $\\sqrt[3]{2}$ is a solution to this equation).  If this equation were to have a rational root $\\frac{a}{b}$ (with $a,b\\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and $b\\not=0$), then $b\\vert 1$ and $a\\vert 2$.  Thus, $\\frac{a}{b}\\in\\{\\pm 1,\\pm 2\\}$.  However, none of $\\pm 1,\\pm 2$ are solutions of $x^3-2=0$.  Therefore the equation $x^3-2=0$ has no rational solutions and $\\sqrt[3]{2}$ is irrational. Alternatively, suppose we have $\\sqrt[3]{2}=\\frac{a}{b}$ for some $a,b\\in \\mathbb{Z}$, $b\\not=0$, and $\\gcd(a,b)=1$.  Then, rearranging and cubing, we have $2b^3=a^3$.  Therefore $a^3$ is even....what does that say about $a$?  What, in turn, does that say about $b$?  It's really not that different from the classic proof that $\\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's start by looking at the user's problem. They want me to act as a math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into their specified structure. The example they provided shows how assumptions are broken down into single-line points, each addressing one property or condition of one object. \n\nThe original problem is titled \"Prove $2^{1/3}$ is irrational.\" The user's question includes a proof attempt with some steps. My task is to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. \n\nFirst, I need to filter out the irrelevant parts. The user mentions correcting mistakes and providing a better proof, but the main goal here is to structure the problem. The key parts are the title and the problem statement within the question. \n\nLooking at the assumptions: The user assumes $2^{1/2}$ is irrational. They also derive that $x = 1/6$ from the equation $2^{1/3} \\cdot 2^x = 2^{1/2}$. Then, they state that if $2^{1/2}$ is irrational, then $(2^{1/2})^{1/3}$ is irrational. They conclude that $2^{1/3}$ is the ratio of two irrational numbers.\n\nBut for the assumptions section, each line should address only one property or condition. So, the main given assumption here is that $\\sqrt{2}$ is irrational. The other steps are part of their proof attempt, not assumptions. The problem is to prove that $2^{1/3}$ is irrational. The user's own proof uses the irrationality of $\\sqrt{2}$, so that's an assumption. The rest of their steps are part of their reasoning but not explicit assumptions provided by the problem. However, in the example given by the user, they included an assumption that wasn't part of the original problem (like $n$ is divisible by 7). Wait, no, in the example, the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7, but the formatted problem included it. Wait, no, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem listed an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example was a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the original example problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem lists assumptions: \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" But that contradicts because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like an error. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in their example. Because if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", then the assumption shouldn't include \"n is divisible by 7\". Perhaps the example is wrong, but the user wants me to follow their format regardless. So perhaps the example is incorrect, but I should follow their instruction as given.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's proof attempt uses the assumption that sqrt(2) is irrational. The problem is to prove that cube root of 2 is irrational. So the explicit assumption given in the problem is that sqrt(2) is irrational. The other steps in the proof attempt are part of their reasoning, not assumptions. Therefore, the formatted problem's assumption section should list that sqrt(2) is irrational. However, the original problem doesn't state that as an assumption, but the user's proof attempt does. Wait, the original problem's title is \"Prove 2^{1/3} is irrational.\" The question says \"Assume 2^{1/2} is irrational.\" So the problem includes the assumption that sqrt(2) is irrational, which the user is using in their proof. Therefore, the assumption here is that sqrt(2) is irrational.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list that assumption. Are there other assumptions? The user's proof involves showing that cube root of 2 is a ratio of two irrational numbers, but that's part of the proof steps, not assumptions. So the only assumption given is that sqrt(2) is irrational. Hence, the problem is to prove cube root of 2 is irrational, under the assumption that sqrt(2) is irrational. So the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n$2^{1/2}$ is irrational.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $2^{1/3}$ is irrational.\n\nBut the user's example included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (n divisible by 7), which might be a mistake. However, in this case, the problem explicitly says to assume sqrt(2) is irrational, so that's the correct assumption here. Therefore, the formatted problem would be as above.",
