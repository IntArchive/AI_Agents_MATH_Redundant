    "Content": "Atiyah Macdonald, Exercise 8.3. Let $k$ be a field and $A$ a finitely generated $k$-algebra. Prove that the following are equivalent: (1) $A$ is Artinian. (2) $A$ is a finite $k$-algebra. I have a question in the proof of (1$\\Rightarrow$2): By using the structure theorem, we may assume that $(A,m)$ is an Artin local ring. Then $A/m$ is a finite algebraic extension of $k$ by Zariski lemma . Since $A$ is Artinian, $m$ is the nilradical of $A$ and thus $m^n=0$ for some $n$. Thus we have a chain $A \\supseteq m \\supseteq m^2 \\supseteq \\cdots \\supseteq m^n=0$. Since $A$ is Noetherian, $m$ is finitely generated and hence each $m^i/m^{i+1}$ is a finite dimensional $A/m$-vector space, hence a finite dimensional $k$-vector space. But now how can I deduce that $A$ is a finite dimensional $k$-vector space?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Prove the following result from general linear algebra: If $V$ is a vector space over a field $k$ and if $\\{0\\}=V_0\\subseteq V_1\\subseteq\\cdots\\subseteq V_{n-1}\\subseteq V_n=V$ where $V_{i}/V_{i-1}$ is a finite dimensional $k$-vector space for all $1\\leq i\\leq n$, then $V$ is a finite dimensional $k$-vector space. Hint : The following steps lead to a solution. Please try to prove this on your own referring to each subsequent step as you need it. For example, first try to prove the result on your own; if you are truly stuck, read step (1). Then try to prove the result with step (1) as a hint and only if you are truly stuck should you read step (2). (1) We work by induction on $n$. The result is clear if $n=1$. In general, let us assume that we have proven the result for $n-1$ and wish to prove the result for $n$. Show that it suffices to establish the following result: If we have a tower $\\{0\\}\\subseteq W\\subseteq V$ where $W$ and $V/W$ are finite dimensional $k$-vector spaces, then $V$ is a finite dimensional $k$-vector space. (2) Let us prove the result directly above. Since $V/W$ is finite dimensional, we may choose a tuple $(v_1+W,\\dots,v_n+W)$ that spans $V/W$ where $v_i\\in V$ for all $1\\leq i\\leq n$. Similarly, since $W$ is finite dimensional, we may choose a tuple $(w_1,\\dots,w_m)$ that spans $W$ where $w_j\\in W$ for all $1\\leq j\\leq m$. Prove that the tuple $(v_1,\\dots,v_n,w_1,\\dots,w_m)$ spans $V$. (3) Conclude that $V$ is finite dimensional by induction. I hope this helps!",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the user's format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions from the question. The original problem is about proving that a finitely generated k-algebra A is Artinian if and only if it's a finite k-algebra. The user is specifically asking about the part of the proof where they need to show that A is a finite dimensional k-vector space once certain conditions are met.\n\nSo, let's break down the assumptions. The problem mentions that k is a field. That's one assumption. Then A is a finitely generated k-algebra, which is another assumption. The problem is in the context of showing that A being Artinian (assumption 3) implies it's a finite k-algebra. \n\nLooking at the details provided in the question: They mention using the structure theorem to assume (A, m) is an Artin local ring. Then A/m is a finite algebraic extension of k by Zariski's lemma. Since A is Artinian, m is the nilradical and m^n = 0 for some n. There's a chain A ⊇ m ⊇ m² ⊇ ... ⊇ mⁿ = 0. Each m^i/m^{i+1} is a finite-dimensional A/m-vector space, hence a finite-dimensional k-vector space. The question is how to deduce A is a finite-dimensional k-vector space.\n\nBut for the assumptions part, we need to list each condition applied to one object. So, first, k is a field. Second, A is a finitely generated k-algebra. Third, A is Artinian. Fourth, (A, m) is an Artin local ring (from the structure theorem). Then, A/m is a finite algebraic extension of k (from Zariski's lemma). Also, m is the nilradical of A. mⁿ = 0 for some integer n. Each quotient m^i/m^{i+1} is a finite-dimensional A/m-vector space, and since A/m is a finite extension of k, each quotient is also a finite-dimensional k-vector space.\n\nWait, but the user's example only lists assumptions that are given in the problem statement, not the steps in the proof. The original problem's assumptions would be: k is a field, A is a finitely generated k-algebra, and either A is Artinian or A is a finite k-algebra (since it's an equivalence). But in the context of the specific part the user is asking about, which is the (1⇒2) direction, the assumptions would be that A is a finitely generated k-algebra and A is Artinian. Additionally, in the proof steps, they use that (A, m) is an Artin local ring, A/m is a finite extension of k, m is nilpotent, and each m^i/m^{i+1} is finite-dimensional over A/m (hence over k). But are these considered assumptions of the problem or part of the proof?\n\nWait, the user's example filtered the original problem to extract the assumptions. The original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. But in the original problem statement, it was stated as \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted version, the assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, no, looking back: the original example was the problem stating \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption was \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like a mistake because the original problem didn't require n to be divisible by 7. Wait, perhaps that example was not correct? Maybe there was a confusion. But perhaps the user's example was a different problem where the original problem had some hidden assumption, but the example given might have been a mistake. Anyway, the key is to structure the problem as per the user's instruction, which is to list the assumptions of the problem from the question, not the steps in the proof.\n\nIn the given Math Stack Exchange question, the problem is to prove that a finitely generated k-algebra A is Artinian iff it is a finite k-algebra. The user is focusing on the direction (1⇒2), where A is Artinian, and they need to show it's a finite k-algebra. The assumptions here would be:\n\n- k is a field.\n\n- A is a finitely generated k-algebra.\n\n- A is Artinian.\n\nBut in the proof steps, they use that (A, m) is an Artin local ring, which comes from the structure theorem, but that might not be an assumption but a step in the proof. However, the user is asking about how to deduce A is a finite-dimensional k-vector space given the chain of ideals and the quotients being finite-dimensional. So perhaps the assumptions relevant to that specific deduction are:\n\n- A is an Artin local ring (since they used the structure theorem to reduce to this case).\n\n- The maximal ideal m of A is nilpotent (m^n = 0).\n\n- Each quotient m^i/m^{i+1} is a finite-dimensional vector space over A/m.\n\n- A/m is a finite algebraic extension of k.\n\nBut these are steps in the proof, not the original problem's assumptions. The original problem's assumptions are just k is a field, A is a finitely generated k-algebra, and A is Artinian. However, the user is asking about the specific part of the proof where these additional structures come into play.\n\nBut according to the user's instructions, the task is to read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filter the unrelated information, and structure the problem into Assumptions and Problem. The example given by the user included assumptions from the problem statement. In the example, the original problem stated \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect because the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7. So perhaps the example was wrong, but the instruction is to list the assumptions from the problem. Therefore, in the current problem, the original problem states: Let k be a field and A a finitely generated k-algebra. Prove that A is Artinian iff it is a finite k-algebra.\n\nThus, the assumptions would be:\n\n- k is a field.\n\n- A is a finitely generated k-algebra.\n\n- A is Artinian (for the direction (1⇒2)).\n\nThe problem is to prove that A is a finite k-algebra under these assumptions. However, in the user's question, they are specifically stuck on a part of the proof where they have a chain A ⊇ m ⊇ m² ⊇ ... ⊇ mⁿ = 0, and each m^i/m^{i+1} is finite-dimensional over A/m, hence over k. They need to deduce A is finite-dimensional over k. So in this specific step, the assumptions would be:\n\n- A is an Artin local ring (with maximal ideal m).\n\n- m is nilpotent (m^n = 0 for some n).\n\n- Each quotient m^i/m^{i+1} is a finite-dimensional vector space over A/m.\n\n- A/m is a finite extension of k.\n\nTherefore, the problem in this step is: Given that A is an Artin local ring with maximal ideal m such that m^n = 0, and each m^i/m^{i+1} is finite-dimensional over A/m, which is a finite extension of k, prove that A is a finite-dimensional k-vector space.\n\nBut according to the user's example, we need to list assumptions from the original problem, not the proof steps. However, the user's example seems to have included an assumption that wasn't explicitly in the original problem (n divisible by 7). Therefore, perhaps the user wants to include all conditions mentioned in the problem statement, including those used in the proof steps that are necessary for the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's example was a mistake, and the actual task is to list the assumptions as given in the problem statement, not the ones derived in the proof. So for the original problem, the problem statement is:\n\nLet k be a field and A a finitely generated k-algebra. Prove that the following are equivalent:\n\n(1) A is Artinian.\n\n(2) A is a finite k-algebra.\n\nThus, for the direction (1⇒2), the assumptions are:\n\n- k is a field.\n\n- A is a finitely generated k-algebra.\n\n- A is Artinian.\n\nAnd the problem is to prove that A is a finite k-algebra.\n\nBut the user's specific question is about the step in the proof where after reducing to the local case, having the chain of ideals, and knowing the quotients are finite-dimensional, how to conclude A is finite-dimensional. In that context, perhaps the relevant assumptions for that step are:\n\n- A is a local Artinian ring with maximal ideal m.\n\n- m is nilpotent (m^n = 0).\n\n- A/m is a finite extension of k.\n\n- Each m^i/m^{i+1} is a finite-dimensional A/m-vector space.\n\nThen the problem is to deduce A is a finite-dimensional k-vector space.\n\nBut since the user wants the problem structured as per the original question, not the intermediate steps, I think the main assumptions are those given in the problem statement. However, the user's example included assumptions that were perhaps part of the problem's context, like \"n is divisible by 7\", which might have been part of a different problem. Given that, perhaps here, the key is to list all explicit assumptions from the problem statement.\n\nOriginal problem's assumptions:\n\n1. k is a field.\n\n2. A is a finitely generated k-algebra.\n\n3. A is Artinian.\n\nProblem: Prove that A is a finite k-algebra.\n\nBut in the example, the user included an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) even though the original problem didn't state that. So perhaps in this case, the user wants to include any assumptions that are part of the problem's context, including those used in the proof steps if they are necessary. However, the example might have been incorrect. To follow the user's instruction correctly, we need to extract from the original problem statement all the assumptions, not the ones derived in the proof.\n\nThe original problem says: Let k be a field and A a finitely generated k-algebra. Prove that (1) A is Artinian iff (2) A is a finite k-algebra.\n\nTherefore, for the direction (1⇒2), the assumptions are:\n\n- k is a field.\n\n- A is a finitely generated k-algebra.\n\n- A is Artinian.\n\nAnd the problem is to prove A is a finite k-algebra.\n\nHowever, the user's specific question is about a step in the proof where they have reduced to the local case and have the chain of ideals with quotients finite-dimensional over k. The user is asking how to conclude A is finite-dimensional over k given those. But the task is to structure the problem as per the original question, not the intermediate steps. So the formatted problem should reflect the original problem's assumptions and the problem as stated.\n\nTherefore, following the example, the assumptions are:\n\nk is a field,\n\nA is a finitely generated k-algebra,\n\nA is Artinian.\n\nProblem: Prove that A is a finite k-algebra.\n\nBut in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. This suggests that perhaps the user's example was incorrect, or maybe they considered that the original problem had an implicit assumption. However, in this case, the original problem states \"A is a finitely generated k-algebra\" and \"A is Artinian\", so those are the assumptions.\n\nBut wait, the example's original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91, but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. This seems contradictory unless there was a miscommunication. Maybe the example was from a different problem where the user made a mistake. In any case, following the user's instruction to structure the problem by filtering unrelated information and listing assumptions line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object.\n\nTherefore, for the given problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- k is a field.\n\n- A is a finitely generated k-algebra.\n\n- A is Artinian.\n\nProblem: Prove that A is a finite k-algebra.\n\nBut the user's specific question in the problem is about the step where after having the chain A ⊇ m ⊇ ... ⊇ mⁿ=0 and each quotient being finite-dimensional over k, how to conclude A is finite-dimensional. However, the task is to structure the original problem, not the intermediate step. Therefore, the formatted problem should be as above.\n\nBut the user's example included an extra assumption not present in the original problem. Maybe the user intended to list all conditions mentioned in the problem, including implicit ones. Alternatively, perhaps the original example was different. Given the ambiguity, I think the correct approach is to list the explicit assumptions from the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n\nk is a field,\n\nA is a finitely generated k-algebra,\n\nA is Artinian.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that A is a finite k-algebra.\n\nBut the user's specific question in their example included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. For example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem included \"n is divisible by 7\". This suggests that maybe in the example, the user intended to modify the problem, perhaps focusing on a specific case. However, in the current problem, the original question doesn't have such hidden assumptions, so we need to stick to the problem as stated.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatted problem is as above.",
