    "Content": "A sequence $\\{f_n\\}$ of measurable functions is said to be a Cauchy sequence in measure if, given $ϵ > 0$, there is an $N$ such that for all $m, n ≥ N$ we have $m\\{x \\in E  :  |f_n(x) − f_m(x)| \\ge ϵ\\} < ϵ$. Show that if $\\{f_n\\}$ is Cauchy in measure, then there exists a measurable function $f$ to which the sequence $\\{f_n\\}$ converges in measure. Idea:  I need to show that $m\\{x \\in E : |f(x) − f_n(x)| \\ge ϵ\\} \\rightarrow 0$ for some measurable function $f$.  I was thinking that there exists $f(x) = \\lim_{k\\to \\infty} f_{n_k}(x)$ where $f_{n_k}$ is a subsequence. But I am unclear as to where to proceed.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "We, essentially, (as always) pass to a subsequence $\\{g_n\\}_{n\\in\\Bbb N}$ which is chosen so that, if $E_j=\\{x:|g_j(x)-g_{j+1}(x)|\\ge 2^{-j}\\},$ then $\\mu(E_j)\\le 2^{-j}.$ Let $F_k=\\cup_{j=k}^\\infty E_j,$ so $\\mu(F_k)\\le 2^{1-k}$ by subadditivity of $\\mu.$ For $x\\notin F_k$ and $i\\ge j\\ge k,$ you can show $$|g_j(x)-g_i(x)|\\le\\sum_{\\ell=j}^{i-1}|g_{\\ell+1}(x) - g_\\ell(x)| \\leq 2^{1-j}$$ by definition of the subsequence. So, $\\{g_n\\}_{n\\in\\Bbb N}$ is pointwise Cauchy on $F_k^C.$ Let $F=\\cap_{k=1}^\\infty F_k$ (this is the $\\lim\\sup$ of the $E_j$ 's), which has $\\mu(F)= 0.$ Then, on $F,$ let $f=0,$ and on $F^C,$ let $f(x):=\\lim\\limits_{j\\to\\infty}g_j(x)$ . Then, $g_j \\to f $ a.e., and $|g_j(x)-f(x)|\\le 2^{1-j}$ for $x \\in F_k^C$ and $j \\ge k.$ Then, note $\\mu(F_k)\\to 0$ and $g_j\\to f$ in measure. Finally, write $$\\{|f_n(x)-f(x)|\\ge\\varepsilon\\}\\subset\\left\\{|f_n(x) -g_j(x)|\\ge\\frac\\varepsilon2\\right\\}\\cup\\left\\{|g_j(x) -f(x)|\\ge\\frac\\varepsilon2\\right\\}$$ and note that the right-hand side can be made small with large $n$ , $j$ , and thus, you have convergence in measure. This is taken from Theorem 2.30 in Folland's Real Analysis: Modern Techniques and their Applications 2e.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions in the problem. The question is about showing that a sequence of functions that is Cauchy in measure converges in measure to some measurable function. \n\nThe original problem states that a sequence {f_n} is Cauchy in measure, which means for any ε > 0, there exists an N such that for all m, n ≥ N, the measure of the set where |f_n - f_m| ≥ ε is less than ε. The goal is to prove there exists a measurable function f such that {f_n} converges in measure to f.\n\nLooking at the example provided, assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. Here, the main assumption is that {f_n} is Cauchy in measure. The problem statement is to show convergence in measure to some measurable function f. \n\nWait, in the example, the assumption included two separate conditions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in the current problem, the only assumption given is that {f_n} is Cauchy in measure. However, in measure theory, when dealing with convergence in measure, we usually assume that the measure space is complete or that the functions are measurable. But the problem states that {f_n} are measurable functions. Let me check the original question again.\n\nThe original question says: \"A sequence {f_n} of measurable functions is said to be a Cauchy sequence in measure if...\" So the assumptions here are that each f_n is measurable, and the sequence is Cauchy in measure. Therefore, the measurable functions are part of the problem's setup. So the assumptions would be:\n\n1. {f_n} is a sequence of measurable functions.\n2. {f_n} is Cauchy in measure (as defined).\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The problem is to show there exists a measurable function f such that the sequence converges in measure to f.\n\nBut the user's example had two assumptions, even though in the original problem, the n was just any integer. Wait, the example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, in the original problem, the user had \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems incorrect. Wait, no, perhaps the example was from a different problem. Let me check:\n\nThe example given by the user was:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems contradictory because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be a mistake. Maybe the user intended to show that when n is divisible by 7, then A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the original problem, it's for every integer n, so the assumption should only be that n is an integer, but the example incorrectly adds another assumption. Hmm, perhaps the user made a mistake in their example. But regardless, following their format, each assumption is a separate line, each applying to one object.\n\nSo back to the current problem. The problem states that {f_n} is a sequence of measurable functions and is Cauchy in measure. Therefore, these are two separate assumptions. Each applies to {f_n}: first, each f_n is measurable; second, the sequence is Cauchy in measure. Then the problem is to show existence of a measurable f to which the sequence converges in measure.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption: \n{f_n} is a sequence of measurable functions,\n{f_n} is a Cauchy sequence in measure.\n\nProblem: Show that there exists a measurable function f such that {f_n} converges in measure to f.\n\nThat should be the correct structure. The original question mentions the definition of Cauchy in measure and asks to show convergence in measure. The user's idea mentions using a subsequence that converges a.e., which is a standard approach in measure theory. However, for the purpose of structuring the problem as per the user's format, we just need to list the assumptions and the problem statement. The assumptions are the given conditions, so each measurable function in the sequence and the Cauchy in measure property. The problem is to prove the existence of the measurable function f.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should list those two assumptions and then the problem statement.",
