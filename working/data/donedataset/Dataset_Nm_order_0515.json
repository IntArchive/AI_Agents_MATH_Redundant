    "Content": "Let $a_1,a_2,a_3,\\ldots$ be reals. Prove that if $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} a_n^{2}$ converges, then so does $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac {a_n}{n}$ . For this I have shown the case for when $ a_n^{2} \\le\\frac {|a_n|}{n}$ $\\Rightarrow$ $ |a_n|\\le\\frac {1}{n}$ $\\Rightarrow$ $\\frac {|a_n|}{n} \\le \\frac{1}{n^{2}}$ and we know that $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac {1}{n^{2}}$ converges and hence $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac {a_n}{n}$ converges by the comparison test.\nNow considering $ a_n^{2} \\ge\\frac {|a_n|}{n}$ $\\Rightarrow$ $\\frac {|a_n|}{n} \\le a_n^{2}$ $\\rightarrow$ combining the two cases for any n we have: $\\frac {|a_n|}{n}\\le\\frac{1}{n^{2}}+a_n^{2}$ Hence using the comparion test again we know that $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} a_n^{2}$ converges and $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac {1}{n^{2}}$ converges hence the sum converges so we can conclude that $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac {a_n}{n}$ is absoluetly convergent $\\Rightarrow$ convergent. \nNot to sure if this is correct, any help would be much appreciated, many thanks.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "What you did is correct; in fact you can show that if $\\{a_n\\}$ and $\\{b_n\\}$ are two sequences of real numbers and $\\sum_{n\\geq 0}a_n^2$ and $\\sum_{n\\geq 0}b_n^2$ are convergent then the series $\\sum_{n=0}^{+\\infty}|a_nb_n|$ is convergent, noting that $0\\leq |a_nb_n|\\leq \\max(a_n^2,b_n^2)\\leq a_n^2+b_n^2$. Your particular case is $b_n=\\frac 1n$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original problem is about proving that if the series of a_n squared converges, then the series of a_n/n also converges. The user provided their attempt, splitting into two cases based on the comparison between a_n² and |a_n|/n. They used the comparison test in both cases and combined the results.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that a_n are real numbers and that the sum of a_n² converges. The user's approach doesn't add any new assumptions but uses inequalities derived from the given. The key assumptions here are that each a_n is a real number and that the series sum of a_n squared converges. The problem is to prove convergence of the series sum of a_n/n.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property. Here, the main assumptions are the realness of a_n and the convergence of their squares. The problem statement is straightforward. The user's attempt might have some errors, but the structured problem doesn't need to include their solution steps, just the original problem's assumptions and statement.\n\nSo, the formatted problem should list the two assumptions: each a_n is a real number, and the sum of a_n² converges. The problem is to prove the convergence of the sum of a_n/n. I need to make sure not to include the user's case analysis or their method, just the original problem's conditions.",
