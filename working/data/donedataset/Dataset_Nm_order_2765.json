    "Content": "I was trying to show that $\\sin(x)$ is non-zero for integers $x$ other than zero and I thought that this result might emerge as a corollary if I managed to show that the result in question is true. I think it's possible to demonstrate this by looking at the power series expansion of $\\sin(x)$ and assuming that we don't know anything about the existence of $\\pi$. All of the answers below insist that the proposition '$\\exists p,q \\in \\mathbb{Z}, \\sin(p)=\\sin(q)$' -where $\\sin(x)$ is the power series representation-is undecidable without using the properties of $\\pi$. If so this is a truly wonderful conjecture and I would like to be provided with a proof. Until then, I insist that methods for analyzing infinite series from analysis should suffice to show that the proposition is false. Note: In a previous version of this post the question said \"bijective\" instead of \"injective\". Some of the answers below have answered the first version of this post.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Suppose that we define the function $\\def\\RR{\\mathbb R}f:\\mathbb R\\to\\mathbb R$ putting $$f(x)=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^nx^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!}$$ for each $x\\in\\mathbb R$, after checking that the power series converges for all real $x$. It is easy to compute derivatives of functions defined by power series, and therefore it is trivial to show that $$f''(x)=-f(x) \\tag{1}$$ for all $x\\in\\RR$. We have $$\\frac{d}{dx}(f(x)^2+f'(x)^2) = 2f'(x)(f''(x)+f(x))=0$$ for all $x\\in\\RR$, so $f(x)^2+f'(x)^2$ is a constant function. Evaluating it at $0$, we see at once that $$f(x)^2+f'(x)^2=1 \\tag{2}$$ for all $x\\in\\RR$. Equation (1) tells us that $f$ and $f'$ are solutions to the linear differentia equation $$u''+u=0.$$ Their Wronskian is $$\\begin{vmatrix}f&f'\\\\f'&f''\\end{vmatrix}=-(f^2+f'^2)$$ is nowhere zero, according to (2), so that $f$ and $f'$ aare linearly independent. Since the differential equation is of order $2$, we see that $\\{f,f'\\}$ is a basis of its solutions. Now fix $y\\in\\RR$ and consider the functions $g(x)=f(x+y)$ and $h(x)=f'(x)f(y)-f(x)f'(y)$. Using (1) we find at once that they are both solutions to out differential equation, and clearly $g(0)=h(0)$ and $g'(0)=h'(0)$, so the uniqueness theoreem of solutions to initial value problems tells us that $g$ and $h$ are the same function, that is, that $$f(x+y)=f'(x)f(y)-f(x)f'(y) \\tag{3}$$ for all $x$ and, s ince $y$ was arbitrary, for all $y$. Compuing the derivative with respect to $y$ in this equation an using (1), we find that also $$f'(x+y)=f'(x)f'(y)+f'(x)f'(y) \\tag{4}$$ for all $x$ and all $y$. I claim that there exists a $p>0$ such that $f'(p)=0$. Once we have checked this, we may compute, using (3) and (4) that \n\\begin{align}\nf(x+2p) &= f'(x+p)f(p)-f(x+p)\\underbrace{f'(p)}_{=0}\\\\\n&=(f'(x)\\underbrace{f'(p)}_{=0}+f(x)f(p))f(p) \\\\\n&= f(x)f(p)^2.\n\\end{align}\nIn view of (2) and out choice of $p$, we have $f(p)\\in\\{\\pm1\\}$, and therefore $f(p)^2=1$ and we have proved that $$f(x+2p)=f(x)$$ for all $x\\in\\RR$, that is, that $f$ is a periodic function and that $2p$ is one of its periods. Let us prove our claim. To do so, suppose it is false, so that $f'(x)\\neq0$ for all $x\\in(0,+\\infty)$. Since $f'(0)=1$ and $f'$ is continuous on $[0,+\\infty)$, we see that in fact $f'(x)>0$ for all $x\\in[0,\\infty)$ and, therefore, that $f$ is strictly increasing on $[0,\\infty)$. In view of (2), we have $f(x)\\leq1$ for all $x\\in[0,infty)$ so we know that the limit $\\alpha=\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)$ exists and is an element of $[0,1]$. As $f'(x)^2=1-f(x)^2$, $f'(x)^2$ converges to $1-\\alpha^2$ as $x\\to\\infty$ and, since $f'(x)$ is positive on $[0,+\\infty)$, we see that $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f'(x)$ is the positive square root $\\beta=\\sqrt{1-\\alpha^2}$. Pick any $y\\in\\RR$. For all $x\\in\\RR$ we have that \n$$f(x+y)=f'(x)f(y)-f(x)f'(y).$$ Taking limits on both sides of this equality as $x\\to\\infty$ we find that $$\\alpha=\\beta f(y)-\\alpha f'(y).$$ This holds for all $y$, so we may differentiate it with resprect to $y$, and we see that $$0=\\beta f'(y)-\\alpha f''(y)=\\beta f'(y)+\\alpha f(y).$$ This is absurd, as $f$ and $f'$ are linearly independent functions. Let now $P$ be the set of positive real numbers $p$ such that $2p$ is a period of $f$. We have shown that $P$ is not empty. Let $\\pi=\\inf P$. If $\\pi=0$, there exists a sequence $(p_i)_{i\\geq1}$ of elements of $P$ converging to $0$, and then $$1=f'(0)=\\lim_{i\\to\\infty}\\frac{f(2p_i)-f(0)}{2p_i}=0.$$ Therefore $\\pi$ is a positive number. Now we may use, for example, the argument of Bourbaki to show that $\\pi$ is irrational. That works because our arguments above easily show that $f(x)>0$ if $x\\in(0,\\pi)$, which is one of the things needed, and we can do the required integration by parts using (1). All this shows in fact that if $f:\\RR\\to\\RR$ is a twice differentiable function such that $f''=-f$ on $\\RR$, $f(0)=0$ and $f'(0)=1$, then $f$ is periodic and its period is irrational. What you want, follows form this.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should list each condition applied to one object, and then state the problem.\n\nLooking at the original problem: The title is \"Is sin: N → R injective?\" The question discusses whether the sine function, when considered with domain the natural numbers, is injective. The user mentions trying to show sin(x) is non-zero for non-zero integers x, and they think injectivity might help. They also talk about using power series without relying on properties of π. Some answers mention it's undecidable without π's properties, but the user believes analysis methods could show injectivity.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem is about injectivity of sin: N → R. The key assumptions here would be:\n\n1. The domain of sin is the set of natural numbers, N.\n2. The codomain is the set of real numbers, R.\n3. The sine function is defined via its power series expansion (as the user mentions not using properties of π, so maybe the analytical definition rather than the unit circle? Though the power series is equivalent to the standard sine function.)\n4. The problem is to determine if this function is injective.\n\nWait, but in the example given, the assumption included specific conditions on n (being an integer and divisible by 7). Here, the assumptions would be about the domain, codomain, and definition of sine. The problem is to check injectivity. The original question had a note about a previous version saying \"bijective\" but corrected to \"injective\". The answers addressed both, but the current question is about injective.\n\nSo, structuring the assumptions line by line:\n\nAssumption: The domain of the sine function is the set of natural numbers (N).\nAssumption: The codomain of the sine function is the set of real numbers (R).\nAssumption: The sine function is defined by its power series expansion.\nProblem: Determine if sin: N → R is injective.\n\nBut wait, the user also mentions not using properties of π. So maybe another assumption is that the analysis does not rely on the existence or properties of π. But how to phrase that? The problem is to show injectivity using power series analysis without invoking π. But perhaps that's part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Alternatively, maybe an assumption is that the sine function is considered independently of π's properties. Hmm.\n\nLooking back at the example, the assumptions listed were about the variables involved. In this case, the assumptions are about the function's domain, codomain, and definition. The problem is to determine injectivity under these conditions.\n\nWait, the original problem's user says they want to show sin is injective on N (natural numbers) using power series without knowing about π. So maybe the key assumptions are:\n\n- The function is sin: N → R.\n- The sine function is defined via its power series expansion (without reference to π).\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: The domain of the sine function is the set of natural numbers.\nAssumption: The sine function is defined by its power series representation.\nProblem: Determine if the sine function is injective.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the codomain is important. The original question says \"sin: N → R\", so codomain is R. But injectivity depends on the domain and codomain. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption: The sine function has domain N.\nAssumption: The sine function has codomain R.\nAssumption: The sine function is defined via its power series expansion without using properties of π.\nProblem: Prove whether sin: N → R is injective.\n\nBut the problem is to determine injectivity. The original question is phrased as \"Is sin: N→R injective?\" So the problem is to prove or disprove injectivity under these assumptions.\n\nSo putting it all together, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The domain of the sine function is the natural numbers (N).\n- The codomain of the sine function is the real numbers (R).\n- The sine function is defined using its power series expansion without invoking properties of π.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were more about the variables (n is integer, n divisible by 7). Here, the assumptions are about the function's definition and domain/codomain. Each assumption is about one property applied to one object (the function in this case, but each aspect as separate points).\n\nWait, but in the example, each assumption was a separate line. For instance, \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\" are two separate assumptions. So here, each assumption would be a separate condition on the function.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption: The domain of the sine function is the set of natural numbers (N).\nAssumption: The codomain of the sine function is the set of real numbers (R).\nAssumption: The sine function is defined by its power series representation.\nProblem: Determine if the sine function is injective.\n\nBut the original question also mentions not using properties of π. The user wants to know if injectivity can be shown using power series analysis without knowledge of π. So maybe that's another assumption.\n\nAssumption: The analysis does not use properties of π.\n\nBut how to phrase that? Maybe:\n\nAssumption: The properties of π are not used in the analysis.\n\nBut that's a meta-assumption about the method rather than the problem's conditions. The example given in the user's prompt includes assumptions about the problem's variables, not the method. So perhaps in this case, the key assumptions are about the function's definition (power series) and domain/codomain. The problem is to determine injectivity without using π's properties, but maybe that's part of the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be phrased as: \"Using only the power series definition of sine and without invoking properties of π, determine if sin: N → R is injective.\"\n\nBut according to the format, the problem should be stated concisely, with assumptions listed separately. The problem is to determine injectivity, and the assumptions are the conditions under which this is considered.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the formatted problem should have assumptions about domain, codomain, and definition (power series), and the problem is to determine injectivity. The note about π is part of the problem's constraints but perhaps not an explicit assumption. However, since the user insists on using power series without π's properties, maybe that's an assumption.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nAssumption: The domain of the sine function is the set of natural numbers.\nAssumption: The codomain of the sine function is the set of real numbers.\nAssumption: The sine function is defined by its power series representation.\nAssumption: The properties of π are not used in the proof.\nProblem: Prove whether the sine function is injective.\n\nBut I'm not sure if the last assumption is necessary. The original problem states that the user wants to show injectivity using power series analysis without knowing about π. So maybe the key is that the sine is defined via power series, and the problem is to determine injectivity under that definition, without relying on π's properties.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The domain is N.\n- The codomain is R.\n- The sine function is defined by its power series expansion (without reference to π or trigonometric properties).\n\nProblem: Prove whether sin: N → R is injective.\n\nBut how to phrase that the definition doesn't use π? Since the power series definition inherently defines sin without reference to π, but in reality, the periodicity is connected to π. However, if we take the power series as the definition, then π would be derived from it. But perhaps the assumption is that we don't use any properties related to π, even if they can be derived.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to determine injectivity of the power series function when restricted to N, without using external knowledge of sine's periodicity or π.\n\nSo putting it all together, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption: The domain of sine is the set of natural numbers.\nAssumption: The codomain of sine is the set of real numbers.\nAssumption: Sine is defined by its power series expansion.\nProblem: Prove whether the function sin: N → R is injective.\n\nThis captures the key points. The mention of not using π's properties is part of the problem's context but is covered by the assumption that sine is defined via power series (which doesn't inherently involve π). Therefore, the answer should be structured as such.",
