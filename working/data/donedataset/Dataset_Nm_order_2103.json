    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $(U_n)_{n \\ge 1}$ be a sequence of independent uniform random variables. By removing null sets, we may assume that for every $n \\ge 1$ , $U_n>0$ everywhere\nFor every $n \\ge 1$ , set $X_n = -\\ln(U_n)$ , $R_n = U_1 \\cdots U_n$ and $S_n = -\\ln R_n = X_1 + \\cdots +X_n$ .\nThen $$I_n = E[(U_1 \\cdots U_n)^{U_1 \\cdots U_n}] = E[R_n^{R_n}] = E[\\exp(R_n \\ln(R_n))] = E[\\exp(-S_ne^{-S_n})].$$ The non-negative sequence $(R_n)_{n \\ge 1}$ is non-decreasing, so it converges necessarily to $0$ (since Borel Cantelli lemma prevents $(U_n)_{n \\ge 1}$ from converging to $1$ ). Hence $R_n^{R_n} \\to 1$ as $n \\to +\\infty$ . Since $0 \\le R_n^{R_n} \\le 1$ . Lebesgue dominated convergence applies so $I_n \\to 1$ as $n \\to +\\infty$ . By construction, the random variables $(X_n)_{n \\ge 1}$ are independent random variables with distribution Exponential $(1)$ , so the distribution of $S_n$ is Gamma $(n,1)$ . Hence $$I_n =  \\int_0^\\infty \\exp(-se^{-s}) \\frac{s^{n-1}e^{-s}}{(n-1)!}ds.$$ For all $s \\ge 0$ , $$\\exp(-se^{-s}) = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-se^{-s})^k}{k!}.$$ This series is normally convergent with regard to $s \\ge 0$ . Since we integrate with regard to a probability measure, we derive \\begin{eqnarray*}\nI_n \n&=&  \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{(-se^{-s})^k}{k!} \\frac{s^{n-1}e^{-s}}{(n-1)!}ds \\\\\n&=& \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^k}{k!(n-1)!} \\int_0^\\infty s^{k+n-1}e^{-(k+1)s}ds \\\\\n&=& \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^k}{k!(n-1)!} \\frac{(k+n-1)!}{(k+1)^{k+n}}.\\end{eqnarray*} \\begin{eqnarray*}\nI_{n+1}-I_n \n&=& \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^k}{k!} \\frac{(k+n-1)!}{n!(k+1)^{k+n+1}} (k+n - n(k+1)) \\\\\n&=& \\frac{n-1}{n!}\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{(k-1)!} \\frac{(k+n-1)!}{(k+1)^{k+n+1}}  \\end{eqnarray*} The last sum of alternating series is strictly positive since for all $k \\ge 1$ , \\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\Big(\\frac{1}{k!} \\frac{(k+n)!}{(k+2)^{k+n+2}} \\Big) \\Big/ \\Big( \\frac{1}{(k-1)!} \\frac{(k+n-1)!}{(k+1)^{k+n+1}} \\Big) \n&=& \\frac{k+n}{k(k+2)} \\Big/\\Big(1+\\frac{1}{k+1}\\Big)^{k+n+1} \\\\\n&\\le& \\frac{k+n}{k(k+2)} \\Big/\\Big(1+\\frac{k+n+1}{k+1}\\Big) \\\\\n&=& \\frac{k+n}{k(k+2)} \\times\\frac{k+1}{2k+n+1}\\\\\n&<& 1.\n\\end{eqnarray*} We are done.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure the given problem according to the user's format. The user provided an example where they listed assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object, and then stated the problem.\n\nFirst, I need to read through the Math Stack Exchange question carefully. The problem is about proving that a sequence of multiple integrals I_n satisfies I_1 = I_2 < I_3 < ... < lim_{n→∞} I_n = 1. The original question includes some steps the user has already taken for n=1, n=2, and n=3, and asks about analytic results for I_3, generalization to I_n, and the limit.\n\nBut the task here is to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. The example given had assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", but in this case, the problem is about integrals over [0,1]^n of (t1 t2 ... tn)^{t1 t2 ... tn} dt1...dtn. So the assumptions would likely be about the variables and the integral setup.\n\nLooking at the problem statement, the integral I_n is defined as multiple integrals over [0,1]^n of the product of t1 to tn raised to the power of their product. The user wants to prove that I1 = I2, I3 is greater than I2, and so on, with the limit approaching 1.\n\nSo the assumptions here would involve the definitions of each I_n. Each I_n is an n-dimensional integral over the interval [0,1] for each variable ti. The integrand is (t1 t2 ... tn)^{t1 t2 ... tn}. So each assumption should list one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nPossible assumptions:\n\n1. For each n, I_n is an n-dimensional integral over [0,1]^n.\n2. The integrand is (t1 t2 ... tn)^{t1 t2 ... tn} dt1...dtn.\n3. The variables t1, t2, ..., tn are integrated from 0 to 1.\n\nBut wait, the example had each assumption as a separate line. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nEach variable t_i is integrated from 0 to 1,\nThe integrand for I_n is (t1 t2 ... tn)^{t1 t2 ... tn}.\n\nWait, but the problem is to prove the inequalities and the limit. The problem statement given in the example was more about the conclusion to be proven. So the assumptions here are the definitions of the integrals I_n for each n, and the problem is to prove the stated relations between them and the limit.\n\nSo, structuring it:\n\nAssumption:\nFor each positive integer n, I_n is defined as the n-dimensional integral over [0,1]^n,\nThe integrand of I_n is (t1 t2 ... tn)^{t1 t2 ... tn} with respect to dt1 dt2 ... dtn.\n\nBut in the original problem, the user also mentions specific cases for n=1, n=2, etc., but those might not be assumptions but rather steps in the solution. The key assumptions are the definition of I_n for any n and the domain of integration.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumptions included the specific condition that n is divisible by 7. However, in the current problem, the original problem doesn't have such specific constraints except that n is a positive integer. The problem is to prove for all n, so maybe the assumption is just that n is a positive integer, and the definition of I_n as the integral.\n\nBut the original problem's statement is to prove that I1 = I2 < I3 < ... < lim_{n→∞} I_n =1. So the problem is to show the equality and inequalities between the integrals and their limit.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nFor each n, I_n is the integral over [0,1]^n of (t1 t2 ... tn)^{t1 t2 ... tn} dt1...dtn.\n\nProblem:\nProve that I_1 = I_2 < I_3 < ... < lim_{n→∞} I_n = 1.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, n being a positive integer is an assumption. Also, each I_n is defined with that integral. But the problem is to prove the chain of inequalities and the limit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each assumption is more specific. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But in the formatted problem, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect? Let me check.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that's conflicting because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Wait, perhaps the example was a mistake. But the user provided that as their example. So maybe in their formatting, the assumptions include both the general conditions and any specific conditions. But if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", then the assumption should be that n is an integer, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. However, the formatted example added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which contradicts the original problem. That might have been an error. But since the user provided that example, we have to follow their format even if it's incorrect.\n\nSo, perhaps in the current problem, even though the original problem states \"for every integer n\", the formatted version adds \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But in the current problem, the user is to structure it correctly.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user is asking to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question. The problem is to prove I_1 = I_2 < I_3 < ... < lim_{n→∞} I_n =1. The assumptions would be the definitions of I_n as the integrals over [0,1]^n with the given integrand. So each I_n is defined as that integral, and n is a positive integer. So:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nFor each n, I_n is defined as the integral over [0,1]^n of (t1 t2 ... tn)^{t1 t2 ... tn} dt1 dt2 ... dtn.\n\nProblem:\nProve that I_1 = I_2 < I_3 < ... < lim_{n→infty} I_n = 1.\n\nBut the original problem mentions \"Prove: I1=I2<I3<⋯ <lim_{n→infty} I_n=1\". So the problem is exactly that statement. The assumptions are the definitions of I_n for each n and that n is a positive integer.\n\nSo, following the example's structure, even if the example had an error, we need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nI_n is an n-dimensional integral over the interval [0,1]^n,\nThe integrand of I_n is (t1 t2 ... tn)^{t1 t2 ... tn}.\n\nProblem:\nProve that I_1 = I_2 < I_3 < ... < lim_{n→infty} I_n = 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe split into more lines:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nEach variable t_i in I_n is integrated from 0 to 1,\nThe integrand of I_n is (t1 t2 ... tn)^{t1 t2 ... tn}.\n\nProblem:\nProve that I_1 = I_2 < I_3 < ... < lim_{n→infty} I_n = 1.\n\nThis seems better, breaking down the integral's variables and the integrand.\n\nI think that's the correct structure. Each assumption is a single condition on one object. The objects here are n, the variables t_i, and the integrand. So each gets its own line.",
