    "Content": "In the Equality of mixed partial derivatives post in this stack exchange, one of the answers to the questions of do partial derivatives commute is: Second order partial derivatives commute if f is $C^2$ (i.e. all the second partial derivatives exist and are continuous). This is sometimes called Schwarz's Theorem or Clairaut's Theorem. This theorem is in my textbooks, yet I cannot seem to find the proof in them. I have tried proving the theorem yet I have gotten stuck. So, what is the proof of Clairaut's Theorem, or why do partial derivatives commute? If the proof is too long, a link to the proof with an intuitive explanation will be sufficient.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "There's this little proof, which uses differentiation under the integral sign. $$\\begin{align} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(x,y) &= \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(x,y_0) + \\int_{y_0}^y \\frac{\\partial^2f}{\\partial x \\partial y}(x,t)\\,{\\rm d}t \\\\ \\frac{\\partial^2f}{\\partial y \\partial x}(x,y) &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\int_{y_0}^y \\frac{\\partial^2f}{\\partial x \\partial y}(x,t)\\,{\\rm d}t \\\\  \\frac{\\partial^2f}{\\partial y \\partial x}(x,y) &=  \\frac{\\partial^2f}{\\partial x \\partial y}(x,y)\\end{align}$$ Another one (\"TVM\" stands for \"mean value theorem\"): Note that this second proof also shows that we only need that both partial derivatives exist, with only one of them being continuous. It is a stronger version.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object, and then the problem statement follows.\n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The title is \"Why can partial derivatives be exchanged?\" and the question mentions Clairaut's Theorem, also known as Schwarz's Theorem. The key point here is that if a function f is of class C² (meaning all its second partial derivatives exist and are continuous), then the mixed partial derivatives are equal. \n\nThe user is asking for the proof of this theorem or an explanation of why partial derivatives commute under these conditions. They also mention that their textbooks state the theorem but don't provide the proof, and they've tried proving it themselves but got stuck.\n\nNow, applying the format. The assumption part needs to list all the conditions. The main condition here is that the function f is twice continuously differentiable (C²). Since the theorem applies to functions with continuous second partial derivatives, that's the critical assumption. Each assumption should be on a separate line and apply to one object. In this case, the function f is the object, and the condition is being C². \n\nWait, the theorem might also require that the function is defined on an open set, which is usually a standard assumption in calculus to ensure that the derivatives exist in a neighborhood around the point of interest. However, the original question doesn't mention this explicitly, so maybe I should stick to what's stated. The answer mentions that the function needs to be C², so the key assumption is that f is a C² function. \n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n- f is a C² function (all second partial derivatives exist and are continuous).\n\nThen the problem is to prove that the mixed partial derivatives are equal, i.e., ∂²f/∂x∂y = ∂²f/∂y∂x.\n\nWait, the original problem states \"why can partial derivatives be exchanged?\" which is the same as saying the mixed partials are equal. So the problem statement would be to prove that under the given assumption, the mixed partial derivatives commute.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n- f is a C² function (all second partial derivatives exist and are continuous).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the mixed partial derivatives of f commute, i.e., ∂²f/∂x∂y = ∂²f/∂y∂x.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is a single line. Since the main condition here is just that f is C², that's one assumption. If there were more, like the domain being open or convex, but the original question doesn't mention those, so maybe they are considered implicit. But according to the example given, the user's example only included the explicit assumptions from the problem. The original problem in the example had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, even though the problem statement just said \"for every integer n\". Wait, in the example, the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the original problem was to prove for every integer n that A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, the assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Wait, perhaps the example was incorrect? Let me check again.\n\nWait the original example says:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n (3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut wait, that seems wrong because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which restricts n. That might be a mistake. Perhaps the example is incorrect. But the user provided that example, so maybe they expect that even if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem would have different assumptions? Hmm, maybe there was a misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem had additional conditions not mentioned here. But given that, maybe I should follow the user's example structure, even if it's not perfect.\n\nBut in the current problem, the key assumption is that f is C². The user's example included multiple assumptions even if the original problem had a universal quantifier. So in our case, the assumption is simply that f is C². So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: f is a C² function (all second partial derivatives exist and are continuous).\n\nProblem: Prove that the mixed partial derivatives of f commute, i.e., ∂²f/∂x∂y = ∂²f/∂y∂x.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to state Clairaut's Theorem, which is exactly that. So the problem is to prove Clairaut's Theorem under the assumption that f is C².\n\nYes, that's correct. So the answer should be structured as such.",
