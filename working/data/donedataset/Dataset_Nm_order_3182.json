    "Content": "Solving a task regaring affine geometry, I've come across a problem: Is it  true that, for every point $(x,y)\\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, there  exist $t\\in \\mathbb{R}, \\alpha\\in[0,2\\pi]$, such that $$x = t\\cos\\alpha + \\sin \\alpha \\\\ y = t\\sin\\alpha + \\cos \\alpha?$$ I don't have any idea how to prove this or find a counterexample. All hints appreciated!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This can be written as\n\\begin{align}\n&\\left(\\begin{array}{cr}\n\\tilde{x} \\\\ \\tilde{y}\n\\end{array}\\right)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\begin{array}{cr}\n1 &-1 \\\\ 1 & 1\n\\end{array}\\right)\\left(\\begin{array}{cr}\nx \\\\ y\n\\end{array}\\right)=\n\\left(\\begin{array}{cr}\nt-1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & t+1\n\\end{array}\\right)\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n\\cos\\left(\\alpha+{\\pi}/{4}\\right) \\\\ \\sin\\left(\\alpha+{\\pi}/{4}\\right)\n\\end{array}\\right).\\tag{1}\n\\end{align}\nSince $(\\tilde{x},\\tilde{y})$ are obtained by rotation of $(x,y)$ by $\\pi/4$, it suffices to show that any point in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ can be represented by the right side of (1). This is equivalent to showing that for any point $P=(x,y)$ with $x,y\\neq 0$ one can always find $t\\neq \\pm1$ such that the ellipse\n$$\\left(\\frac{x}{t-1}\\right)^2+\\left(\\frac{y}{t+1}\\right)^2=1 \\tag{2}$$\npasses through $P$ (which is true - think on what happens to this ellipse when $t$ continuously decreases from $\\infty$ to $1$, and then from $1$ to $-1$).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. The example provided shows that the assumptions should list each condition applied to one object, and then the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the original question: The user is asking if for every point (x,y) in the plane, there exist real numbers t and α (with α between 0 and 2π) such that x and y are expressed in terms of t, cos α, and sin α as given. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states \"for every point (x,y) in ℝ²\", so one assumption is that (x,y) is in ℝ². Then, the existence of t in ℝ and α in [0, 2π). Each of these should be separate assumptions. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n- (x, y) is a point in ℝ².\n- t is a real number.\n- α is a real number in the interval [0, 2π).\n\nThe problem is to prove whether for every such (x,y), there exist t and α satisfying those equations.\n\nWait, but in the example given, sometimes assumptions are conditions on variables. Here, the problem is to show existence of t and α for each (x,y). So the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. The user in the example had included the divisibility by 7 as an assumption, but here the problem is a universal statement. However, according to the instructions, assumptions should list the conditions applied to each object in the problem. So in this case, the problem is for all (x,y) in ℝ², there exist t and α (with α in [0,2π)) such that the equations hold. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- (x, y) is a point in ℝ².\n- t is a real number.\n- α is a real number in the interval [0, 2π).\n\nThe problem is to prove that for every (x,y), such t and α exist.\n\nI need to check if that's all. The equations are part of the problem statement, not assumptions. The assumptions are the conditions that the variables must satisfy. So yes, that should be correct.",
