    "Content": "I am trying to solve the following problem: Define the following functions for $x>0$:\n  $$f_n(x):=\\prod_{k=0}^{n}\\frac{1}{x+k}$$ Show that the function\n  $$f(x):=\\sum_{n=0}^{+\\infty}f_n(x)$$\n  is well defined for $x>0$. Calculate its value in $1$. Study the function $f(x)$ and give asymptotic estimates for $x \\to 0^+$ and $x\\to +\\infty$. Prove that the following equivalence holds:\n  $$f(x)=e \\sum_{n=0}^{+\\infty}\\frac{(-1)^n}{(x+n)n!}$$ I am having a hard time proving the equality in the third point. What I have done for now: $\\textbf{Part 1}$ Using the ratio test,\n$$\\lim_{n\\to +\\infty}\\frac{\\prod_{k=0}^{n+1}\\frac{1}{x+k}}{\\prod_{k=0}^{n}\\frac{1}{x+k}}=\\lim_{n\\to +\\infty}\\frac{1}{x+n+1}=0$$\n the series converges for $x>0$. The value of the function in $1$ is $$f(1)=\\sum_{n=0}^{+\\infty}\\prod_{k=0}^{n}\\frac{1}{k+1}=\\sum_{n=0}^{+\\infty}\\frac{1}{(n+1)!}=e-1$$ $\\textbf{Part 2}$ First of all, $f$ is positive for every $x>0$. Its monotonicity is immediate: if $x_2>x_1$, $$\\begin{align} \\quad \\qquad \\frac{1}{x_2+k}<\\frac{1}{x_1+k} \\end{align} \\\\\n  \\implies f(x_2)=\\sum_{n=0}^{+\\infty}\\prod_{k=0}^{n}\\frac{1}{x_2+k}\\leq\\sum_{n=0}^{+\\infty}\\prod_{k=0}^{n}\\frac{1}{x_1+k}=f(x_1)$$ The general term of the series $f$ must be zero, because it converges; hence in an interval $[M,+\\infty)$ with $M>0$ $$||f_n(x) ||_{\\infty}=\\prod_{k=0}^{n}\\frac{1}{M+k}$$\n$$\\implies \\sum_{n=0}^{+\\infty}||f_n(x)|| \\text{  is convergent}$$ so the series is uniformly convergent on every interval of the type $[M,+\\infty)$. $f$ is asymptotic to $\\frac 1x$ for $x\\to +\\infty$: in fact $$\\lim_{x\\to \\infty}\\frac{f(x)}{\\frac{1}{x}}= \\lim_{x\\to \\infty}  x\\left (\\frac{1}{x}+ \\sum_{n=1}^{+\\infty}\\prod_{k=0}^{n}\\frac{1}{x+k}\\right )= 1 $$ because the series converges in a neighbourhood of $+\\infty$. In a neighbourhood of $0$, the function acts similarly: we can notice that $$\\lim_{x\\to 0^+}\\frac{f(x)}{\\frac{1}{x}}=\\lim_{x\\to 0^+} x\\sum_{n=0}^{+\\infty}\\prod_{k=0}^{n}\\frac{1}{x+k}=\\lim_{x \\to 0^+} x\\left (\\frac{1}{x}+ \\sum_{n=1}^{+\\infty}\\prod_{k=0}^{n}\\frac{1}{x+k}\\right )=  \\lim_{x\\to 0^+}  1 + \\sum_{n=1}^{+\\infty}\\prod_{k=1}^{n}\\frac{1}{x+k}$$ but $\\sum_{n=1}^{+\\infty}\\prod_{k=1}^{n}\\frac{1}{x+k}$ converges in $x=0$ and is continuous, so the limit is $$\\lim_{x\\to 0^+}\\frac{f(x)}{\\frac{1}{x}} = 1+  \\sum_{n=1}^{+\\infty}\\prod_{k=1}^{n}\\frac{1}{k}=e$$ hence $f \\sim \\frac{e}{x}$ Monotonicity and limits of this function imply that $f$ is a bijection of $(0,+\\infty)$ in itself. $\\textbf{Part 3}$ I have tried to manipulate the sums: writing a single fraction instead of the product does not seem to work: it leads to $$\\sum_{n=0}^{+\\infty}\\prod_{k=0}^{n}\\frac{1}{x+k}=\\frac{1}{x}+\\frac{1}{x}\\frac{1}{x(x+1)}+\\dots=\\lim_{n\\to +\\infty}\\frac{\\sum_{h=0}^{n}\\prod_{k=0}^h(x+k)}{\\prod_{k=0}^{n}(x+k)}$$ It does not seem very familiar, even dividing it by $e=\\sum_{n=0}^{+\\infty}\\frac{1}{n!}=f(1)$ Another idea that came to mind was to use the Cauchy product series and the Cauchy series product on the RHS : it leads to $$\\sum_{i=0}^{+\\infty}\\frac{1}{i!}\\sum_{j=0}^{+\\infty}\\frac{(-1)^j}{(x+j)j!}=\\sum_{k=0}^{+\\infty}\\sum_{l=0}^{k}\\frac{(-1)^{k-l}}{(x+k-l)l!(k-l)!}$$ Things seem as complicated as before. Integrating or derivating $f(x)$ term by term would require to know a general form for the integral/derivative of $f_n(x)=\\prod_{k=0}^{n}\\frac{1}{x+k}$: it does not appear impossible to find it, but I think it would not be of great practical use; moreover, the series does not converge uniformly on  the whole interval $(0,+\\infty)$. The same goes for the series on the RHS . Working backwards, I thought of finding its integral/series on the interval $[M,+\\infty)$ : I obtained $$\\int \\left (e\\sum_{n=0}^{+\\infty}\\frac{(-1)^n}{(x+n)n!} \\right ) dx =e\\sum_{n=0}^{+\\infty} \\int \\frac{(-1)^n}{(x+n)n!}  dx=e\\sum_{n=0}^{+\\infty}  \\frac{(-1)^n}{n!}\\log(x+n)+C $$ I can't get far from here, and I am not even sure if what I have done is correct. Question : Are the two first parts correct? What could be a good way of proving the equality in the third part?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "For the remaining third point, I would use the formula\n$$f_n(x)=\\frac1{n!}\\int_0^1 t^{x-1}(1-t)^{n}dt.$$\nExchanging the order of summation and integration, we get\n\\begin{align*}\nf(x)&=\\int_0^1 t^{x-1} \\left(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{(1-t)^n}{n!}\\right)dt\n=\\int_0^1 t^{x-1}e^{1-t}dt=\\\\&=e\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}\\int_0^1\\frac{(-1)^k t^{x-1+k}}{k!}dt=e\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{(-1)^k}{(x+k)k!}.\n\\end{align*}",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement from the original question. Let me read through the original question again carefully.\n\nThe original problem has three parts:\n\n1. Show that the function f(x) is well-defined for x > 0 and calculate its value at x=1.\n2. Study the function f(x) and give asymptotic estimates as x approaches 0+ and infinity. Also, prove that f is a bijection.\n3. Prove the equivalence f(x) = e * sum_{n=0}^infty (-1)^n / [(x + n) n!].\n\nThe user mentioned they're having trouble with part 3, the equality. However, in the example provided, the formatted problem focused on one specific part of the original problem. So, in the user's example, they extracted a part of the problem (divisibility by 91) even though the original problem had more parts. So maybe here, the task is to structure the part that the user is struggling with, which is part 3.\n\nLooking at the original problem statement:\n\n\"Prove that the following equivalence holds: $$f(x)=e \\sum_{n=0}^{+\\infty}\\frac{(-1)^n}{(x+n)n!}$$ I am having a hard time proving the equality in the third point.\"\n\nSo the main problem here is to prove that equivalence. The assumptions would be the conditions given for this part. Let's check what is given for part 3. The functions are defined for x > 0. The functions f_n(x) are products from k=0 to n of 1/(x + k). Then f(x) is the sum from n=0 to infinity of f_n(x). So the assumptions for the problem part 3 would be:\n\n- x > 0\n- f_n(x) = product_{k=0}^n 1/(x + k)\n- f(x) = sum_{n=0}^infty f_n(x)\n\nSo each of these should be listed as separate assumptions. The problem is to show that f(x) equals e times the given series.\n\nBut wait, the original problem has three parts, but the user's example extracted a specific part. In the example, the original problem had the assumption that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7, but in the example given, the user actually structured the problem by extracting only the divisibility by 91 part, even though the original problem might have had more. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n. However, the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the user says \"for every integer n\", and the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". But maybe that was an error. Wait, no. Wait, looking at the example:\n\nOriginal problem says: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut the formatted problem lists assumptions as n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But that seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps the example was incorrect. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Wait, the original problem in the example was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem lists assumptions as n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But that would mean that the problem is to prove divisibility by 91 under the assumption that n is divisible by 7. But the original problem didn't have that restriction. Hmm, maybe the example was structured incorrectly, but that's the user's example. So perhaps the user is expecting to take the original problem, filter out unrelated information, and structure it with the necessary assumptions and the specific problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the user on Math Stack Exchange is asking to structure the problem given in their question. The problem has multiple parts, but the user is stuck on part 3. So, following the example, we need to structure the specific part they are struggling with, which is proving the equivalence f(x) = e * sum_{n=0}^infty (-1)^n / [(x + n) n!].\n\nTherefore, the assumptions for this part would be:\n\n- x is a positive real number (x > 0)\n- f_n(x) is defined as the product from k=0 to n of 1/(x + k)\n- f(x) is defined as the sum from n=0 to infinity of f_n(x)\n\nEach of these should be separate lines in the assumption section. The problem statement is to prove the given equivalence.\n\nLooking at the user's example, they included assumptions like \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\", even though the original problem didn't state the second assumption. Wait, that seems confusing. Wait, maybe in the example, the user mistakenly added an assumption, or perhaps there was a misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps in the original problem, there was an implicit assumption. But no, in the original example, the problem was to prove for every integer n, which includes all integers, but the formatted problem added the assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Therefore, maybe the example is wrong, but the user provided it as an example, so we should follow their format even if the example is flawed.\n\nIn any case, for the current problem, the key is to list all assumptions for the specific part of the problem. The problem part 3 requires proving an equivalence, so the assumptions would be the definitions given in the problem for f_n(x) and f(x), and x > 0.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- x is a positive real number (x > 0)\n- For each non-negative integer n, f_n(x) is defined as the product from k=0 to n of 1/(x + k)\n- f(x) is defined as the sum from n=0 to infinity of f_n(x)\n\nEach of these is a separate line. Then the problem is to prove that f(x) equals e times the given series.\n\nNow, checking the original problem statement again:\n\n\"Prove that the following equivalence holds: $$f(x)=e \\sum_{n=0}^{+\\infty}\\frac{(-1)^n}{(x+n)n!}$$\"\n\nYes, that's the specific problem. So the assumptions are as above. There's no other hidden assumptions here. The user has already established convergence and computed f(1) in part 1, but for part 3, the main assumptions are the definitions of f_n and f, and x > 0.\n\nTherefore, structuring this into the required format:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a positive real number,\nFor each non-negative integer $n$, $f_n(x) = \\prod_{k=0}^{n} \\frac{1}{x + k}$,\n$f(x)$ is defined as $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} f_n(x)$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$f(x) = e \\sum_{n=0}^{+\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^n}{(x + n) n!}.$$\n\nBut in the example, each assumption is a single line, and each applies to one object. For example, \"n is an integer\", \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, \"x is a positive real number\" is one assumption. The definition of f_n(x) is another, and the definition of f(x) is another. Each applies to one object (x, f_n(x), f(x)).\n\nThus, this should be the formatted problem.",
