    "Content": "This is an old preliminary exam problem: Show that, for every nonnegative Lebesgue integrable function $f:[0,1]\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ and every $\\epsilon>0$ there exists a $\\delta>0$ such that for each measurable set $A\\subset [0,1]$ with $m(A)<\\delta$ it follows that $\\int_A f(x)dx<\\epsilon$. Here's my attempt at a proof: Since $[0,1]$ is compact, and $f$ is real-valued, there exists an $M>0$ such that $f(x)\\le M$ for all $x\\in [0,1]$. Therefore, for $\\epsilon>0$, let  $\\delta=\\epsilon/M$. Then for all  $A\\subset [0,1]$ such that  $m(A)<\\delta$,  we have that $\\int_A f(x)dx\\le Mm(A)<\\epsilon$. Where here $m$ denotes Lebesgue measure. The part I'm unsure about is the existence of $M$. If the function is continuous, then there is no problem, but $f$ does not have to be continuous to be Lebesgue measurable. On the other hand, the problem says that $f$ is real-valued, not extended real-valued, so this means that $f(x)$ is defined and finite for each $x$, right?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Any integrable $f:[0,1] \\to R$ can be approximated by a continuous function $f_\\epsilon$ on $[0,1]$ up to $\\epsilon$ in $L^1$. With this, the fix to your argument is to use the triangle inequality: $$\\left| \\int_A f dx \\right| \\leq \\left| \\int_A (f-f_\\epsilon) dx \\right| + \\left| \\int_A f_\\epsilon dx \\right| \\leq \\epsilon + \\delta M.$$ Epsilon is picked first, from this we get an $M$ dependent on $f_\\epsilon$ (dependent on $\\epsilon$) and from this we can pick $\\delta = \\epsilon/M$. to get the upper bound $2 \\epsilon$. If you don't feel comfortable with a continuous approximation (ala Lusin's theorem) you can use simple functions instead.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem based on the given example. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the problem according to the specified structure. \n\nFirst, the original problem is about showing that for every nonnegative Lebesgue integrable function f on [0,1] and every epsilon > 0, there exists a delta > 0 such that if a measurable set A has measure less than delta, then the integral of f over A is less than epsilon. \n\nThe user's example included breaking down the assumptions into single line items, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So, I need to list all the assumptions from the problem. Let me parse the problem statement again:\n\n1. The function f is nonnegative. That's one assumption.\n2. The function f is Lebesgue integrable on [0,1]. Another assumption.\n3. The domain of f is [0,1], mapping to the real numbers. The problem mentions \"nonnegative Lebesgue integrable function f:[0,1]→ℝ\", so that's another condition.\n4. The set A is a measurable subset of [0,1]. The problem states \"for each measurable set A⊂[0,1]\".\n5. The measure of A is less than delta. So m(A) < delta is a condition on A.\n6. Epsilon is greater than 0, given. So that's an input condition.\n\nWait, but in the example provided, the assumptions were specific to the objects. For instance, in the example, the first assumption was \"n is an integer\", the second was \"n is divisible by 7\". So each assumption is about one property of a single object.\n\nIn this problem, the main objects are f, A, epsilon, delta. Let's list the assumptions:\n\n- f is a nonnegative function.\n- f is Lebesgue integrable on [0,1].\n- The domain and codomain of f are [0,1] and ℝ respectively. (As stated in the problem: f:[0,1]→ℝ)\n- A is a measurable subset of [0,1].\n- m(A) < delta (this is part of the problem's condition, but maybe not an assumption? Wait, the problem is to show that given any epsilon >0, there exists delta >0 such that whenever m(A) < delta, the integral over A is less than epsilon. So in the problem statement, the user is supposed to prove that such a delta exists. So the assumptions for the problem would be the properties of f and the conditions given on A, epsilon, delta. But in the example, the assumption included the conditions on the variables. Wait, in the example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer. But in the formatted problem, the user listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, but actually, the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7. Wait, looking back at the example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut in the formatted problem, they listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should just be that n is an integer, right? But in the formatted example, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the user made an error in their example? Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the only assumption is that n is an integer, but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That would be incorrect because the problem is to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, so the only assumption is that n is an integer. The mention of 7 might be because 91 is 7*13, but it's not part of the problem's assumption. So perhaps the example is flawed. \n\nBut regardless, following the user's example, they listed two assumptions for the problem where only one was given. Maybe they intended to filter out unrelated information. Wait, the original example's formatted problem has \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", but the original problem states \"for every integer n\". So maybe the user made a mistake there. However, since the user provided that example, I need to follow their format even if it's incorrect. \n\nBut in the current problem, the user wants to format the problem as in the example. So let me see the example structure again:\n\nAssumption: Each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nProblem: The problem statement.\n\nIn the given problem here, the user is to structure the problem from Math Stack Exchange. The problem is: Show that for every nonnegative Lebesgue integrable function f on [0,1] and every epsilon >0, there exists a delta >0 such that whenever A is measurable with m(A) < delta, then the integral over A is less than epsilon.\n\nSo the assumptions here would be:\n\n- f is a nonnegative function. (Property of f)\n- f is Lebesgue integrable on [0,1]. (Property of f)\n- f: [0,1] → ℝ. (Domain and codomain)\n- For every ε > 0. (Given)\n- A is a measurable subset of [0,1]. (Property of A)\n- m(A) < δ. (Condition on A)\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumptions included the problem's hypotheses. For instance, in the example, the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted assumption lists \"n is an integer\". So in this case, the problem's hypotheses become the assumptions. So here, the problem's hypotheses are:\n\n- f is nonnegative, Lebesgue integrable on [0,1], maps to ℝ.\n- ε > 0 is given.\n- A is measurable subset of [0,1] with m(A) < δ.\n\nBut the conclusion to be shown is that there exists δ >0 such that for any such A, the integral is < ε.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions included the variables' conditions. So perhaps here, the assumptions would be:\n\n- f is a nonnegative function.\n- f is Lebesgue integrable on [0,1].\n- f is real-valued (as opposed to extended real-valued, as the user mentioned in their question).\n- ε is a positive real number.\n- A is a measurable subset of [0,1].\n- m(A) < δ.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user is to show that for every ε >0, there exists δ >0 such that for every A with m(A) < δ, the integral is less than ε. So the problem is given f is nonnegative, integrable, and real-valued, then for any ε >0, find δ.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions for the problem are the conditions on f and ε. The conditions on A and δ are part of the problem statement. But according to the example, assumptions include all conditions on the variables involved in the problem. For instance, in the example, n is an integer is an assumption, even though it's part of the \"for every integer n\" in the problem. So following that, the assumptions here would include:\n\n- f is a nonnegative Lebesgue integrable function on [0,1].\n- f maps [0,1] to ℝ (since the problem specifies it's real-valued, not extended real-valued).\n- ε is a positive real number.\n- A is a measurable subset of [0,1].\n- m(A) < δ.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user is to show the existence of δ given ε, so the δ is to be found, not given. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- f is nonnegative.\n- f is Lebesgue integrable on [0,1].\n- f: [0,1] → ℝ (i.e., finite-valued).\n- ε > 0 is given.\n- A is a measurable subset of [0,1] with m(A) < δ.\n\nBut the problem is structured as: Given f satisfying the first three assumptions and given ε >0, find δ >0 such that for any A (satisfying the last two assumptions), the integral is < ε.\n\nHowever, in the example, the assumptions were listed as conditions that are given. So perhaps the assumptions here are:\n\n1. f is a nonnegative function.\n2. f is Lebesgue integrable on [0,1].\n3. f is real-valued (i.e., f(x) is finite for all x in [0,1]).\n4. ε is a positive real number.\n5. A is a measurable subset of [0,1].\n6. m(A) < δ (this is part of the condition to be applied, but δ is to be determined based on ε).\n\nBut the problem is to show that given f (satisfying 1-3) and ε (4), there exists δ such that for any A (5) with m(A) < δ (6), the integral is < ε.\n\nBut in terms of the problem's structure, the assumptions are the hypotheses that are given. So in the example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The assumption there is \"n is an integer\". Here, the problem is to show that for every nonnegative integrable f and every ε>0, there exists δ>0... So the assumptions would be:\n\n- f is a nonnegative function.\n- f is Lebesgue integrable on [0,1].\n- f is real-valued (as opposed to extended real-valued, which is important because the user's question mentions this).\n- ε is a positive real number.\n\nThen the problem is to show the existence of δ such that for any measurable A with m(A) < δ, the integral over A is < ε.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. So breaking down:\n\nAssumption 1: f is a nonnegative function. (Property of f)\nAssumption 2: f is Lebesgue integrable on [0,1]. (Another property of f)\nAssumption 3: f maps [0,1] to ℝ (i.e., f is real-valued, not taking infinite values). (Another property of f)\nAssumption 4: ε is a positive real number. (Condition on ε)\nAssumption 5: A is a measurable subset of [0,1]. (Property of A)\nAssumption 6: m(A) < δ. (Condition on A, but δ is to be determined based on ε)\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the user has to prove that for every ε>0, there exists δ>0 such that for every A with m(A) < δ, the integral is less than ε. So the only given conditions are on f and ε, and then the conclusion involves δ and A. So perhaps the assumptions are only on f and ε, while A and δ are part of the problem's conclusion.\n\nBut the example included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. Wait, but in the example's original problem, it was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. So the only assumption should be \"n is an integer\". The divisibility by 7 isn't part of the problem's assumption; it's part of the solution (since 91 = 7*13, perhaps the problem requires that n satisfies some divisibility). But perhaps the example was incorrect. But since the user provided that example, I need to follow their structure even if it's flawed.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's question includes the original problem's statement, which says: \"for every nonnegative Lebesgue integrable function f:[0,1]→ℝ and every ε>0, there exists δ>0 such that for each measurable set A⊂[0,1] with m(A)<δ, ∫_A f(x)dx < ε\".\n\nSo the assumptions here are on f (nonnegative, integrable, real-valued), on ε (positive), and on A (measurable, subset of [0,1], m(A) < δ). But δ is to be found, so m(A) < δ is a condition once δ is determined.\n\nBut according to the example, assumptions are the given conditions. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption 1: f is a nonnegative function.\nAssumption 2: f is Lebesgue integrable on [0,1].\nAssumption 3: f is real-valued (i.e., f(x) ∈ ℝ for all x ∈ [0,1]).\nAssumption 4: ε is a positive real number.\nAssumption 5: A is a measurable subset of [0,1].\nAssumption 6: m(A) < δ.\n\nBut the problem is to show that given 1-4, there exists δ such that 5 and 6 imply ∫_A f < ε.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were listed as properties of the variables in the problem. So in that example, even though the problem said \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. Similarly, here, even though the problem says \"for every nonnegative Lebesgue integrable function f...\", the assumptions should list the properties of f. So:\n\nAssumption 1: f is a nonnegative function.\nAssumption 2: f is Lebesgue integrable on [0,1].\nAssumption 3: f is real-valued (i.e., f: [0,1] → ℝ).\nAssumption 4: ε is a positive real number.\nAssumption 5: A is a measurable subset of [0,1].\nAssumption 6: m(A) < δ.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the conclusion is that there exists δ >0 such that whenever A satisfies 5 and 6, then ∫_A f < ε. So the problem's assumptions are 1-4, and the conditions on A and δ are part of the implication.\n\nHowever, according to the user's example, they included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, even though the original problem was to prove for every integer n, so the divisibility by 7 was not an assumption but part of the solution. This suggests that perhaps the user's example has a mistake, but since I have to follow their format, I need to list all the conditions given in the problem as assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example's original problem had a typo, and the correct assumption is that n is an integer, and the problem was to prove divisibility by 91 when n is divisible by 7. But the example given by the user may have inconsistencies.\n\nGiven that, for the current problem, to follow the user's format, I should list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property of one object. So:\n\nAssumption 1: f is a nonnegative function.\nAssumption 2: f is Lebesgue integrable on [0,1].\nAssumption 3: f maps [0,1] to ℝ (real-valued).\nAssumption 4: ε is a positive real number.\nAssumption 5: A is a measurable subset of [0,1].\nAssumption 6: m(A) < δ.\n\nBut δ is not given; it's to be determined. So perhaps assumption 6 should not be listed as an assumption but as part of the problem's conclusion. However, in the example, they included \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption even though the problem's original statement didn't state that. That suggests that maybe the user wants to include even the conditions that are part of the conclusion's implication as assumptions. But that seems incorrect.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem was to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions were \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But that's contradictory because if n must be divisible by 7, then it's not for every integer n. So perhaps the example is incorrect, but since the user provided it, I have to proceed carefully.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example's original problem had a different wording. Suppose the original problem was to prove that if n is an integer divisible by 7, then A(n) is divisible by 91. Then the formatted assumptions would make sense. But the user wrote the original problem as \"for every integer n\", which conflicts with the formatted assumptions.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, perhaps the user intended that the formatted problem should list all hypotheses and conditions necessary for the problem, even those that are part of the universal quantifier. So in the current problem, the hypotheses are that f is nonnegative, integrable, real-valued, and ε >0 is given. Then the problem is to show the existence of δ such that for any measurable A with m(A) < δ, the integral is < ε.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n1. f is a nonnegative function.\n2. f is Lebesgue integrable on [0,1].\n3. f is real-valued (i.e., finite everywhere).\n4. ε is a positive real number.\n5. A is a measurable subset of [0,1].\n6. m(A) < δ.\n\nBut again, δ is to be found, so m(A) < δ is part of the condition to be applied once δ is chosen. However, in the example, they included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, even though the original problem's statement was \"for every integer n\". This suggests that in the example, the user mistakenly added an extra condition. But since the user provided that example, perhaps they want me to list all conditions that are mentioned in the problem, including those that are universally quantified.\n\nIn the current problem, the conditions are:\n\n- For every nonnegative Lebesgue integrable function f: [0,1] → ℝ.\n- For every ε > 0.\n- There exists δ > 0.\n- For every measurable A ⊂ [0,1] with m(A) < δ.\n\nBut the problem is to show the existence of δ given f and ε, such that for all A satisfying m(A) < δ, the integral is less than ε.\n\nThus, the assumptions should be:\n\n1. f is nonnegative.\n2. f is Lebesgue integrable on [0,1].\n3. f is real-valued.\n4. ε > 0.\n5. A is measurable.\n6. A ⊂ [0,1].\n7. m(A) < δ.\n\nBut δ is dependent on ε and f, so it's not an assumption but a variable to be determined. Therefore, the correct assumptions are 1-4, and 5-7 are part of the implication (if A is measurable, subset of [0,1], and m(A) < δ, then...). But according to the user's example, they included the conditions that are part of the universal quantifier as assumptions. So even though the problem says \"for every integer n\", the assumption is listed as \"n is an integer\". Similarly, here, \"for every nonnegative Lebesgue integrable function f\" translates to \"f is nonnegative, Lebesgue integrable on [0,1], real-valued\". \"For every ε >0\" translates to \"ε is a positive real number\". \"For every measurable A ⊂ [0,1] with m(A) < δ\" translates to \"A is measurable, A ⊂ [0,1], m(A) < δ\".\n\nSo following the example, each of these should be listed as separate assumptions. Therefore, the formatted assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a nonnegative function,\nf is Lebesgue integrable on [0,1],\nf is real-valued,\nε is a positive real number,\nA is a measurable subset of [0,1],\nm(A) < δ.\n\nProblem:\nShow that for every nonnegative Lebesgue integrable function f:[0,1]→ℝ and every ε>0, there exists a δ>0 such that for each measurable set A⊂[0,1] with m(A)<δ, it follows that ∫_A f(x)dx < ε.\n\nWait, but the problem statement in the formatted version should be concise. Let me check the user's example again. The original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem lists the assumptions and then the problem is to prove the expression is divisible by 91.\n\nSimilarly, in this case, after listing the assumptions, the problem would be to show that under these assumptions, there exists δ such that whenever A meets m(A) < δ, the integral is < ε.\n\nBut the problem statement as given in the user's example seems to restate the problem concisely. So the problem part here should be: \"Prove that for every nonnegative Lebesgue integrable function f: [0,1] → ℝ and every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for each measurable set A ⊂ [0,1] with m(A) < δ, ∫_A f(x) dx < ε.\"\n\nBut in the formatted example, the problem part is a bit shortened. For example, in the example, the problem is stated as \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91\", whereas the original problem had \"for every integer n\".\n\nSo perhaps here, the problem can be phrased as:\n\nProblem: Prove that for every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that whenever A is a measurable subset of [0,1] with m(A) < δ, then ∫_A f(x) dx < ε.\n\nBut the assumptions already include that f is nonnegative, integrable, real-valued, ε >0, A is measurable subset, and m(A) < δ.\n\nBut the user's example included in the problem part the expression to prove, including the quantifiers. So perhaps it's better to restate the problem with all quantifiers, but keeping it concise.\n\nAlternatively, given that the assumptions have already listed the conditions on f, ε, A, and δ, the problem statement can be shorter. However, the example includes the full problem statement in the \"Problem\" section, even if some conditions are listed in assumptions.\n\nWait, in the example, the formatted problem's \"Problem\" section is: \"Prove that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$ is divisible by 91.\" Even though the assumptions included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So the problem statement omits the quantifiers because they are listed as assumptions. But in reality, the original problem's quantifier was \"for every integer n\", which should be part of the problem statement, but in the example, it's moved to assumptions. That seems incorrect, but perhaps that's the user's format.\n\nSo following that, the current problem's assumptions would list all the conditions (f's properties, ε >0, A's properties, m(A) < δ), and the problem statement would be to show the integral < ε. But the problem is originally stated with quantifiers: \"for every nonnegative...\", \"for every ε>0\", \"there exists δ>0\", \"for each measurable A...\". So to follow the example's style, perhaps the problem part is just the core statement without repeating the quantifiers, as the quantifiers are captured in the assumptions.\n\nBut in the example, the problem part is \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91\", and the assumptions include \"n is an integer\". But the original problem had \"for every integer n\", which is a universal quantifier. So in the formatted problem, the universal quantifier is moved to the assumptions as a condition on n.\n\nApplying that here, the problem statement would be: \"Prove that ∫_A f(x) dx < ε\", and the assumptions would include all the conditions (f's properties, ε>0, A measurable, m(A) < δ). However, the actual original problem requires showing the existence of δ, so the problem is not just about the integral being less than ε, but about the existence of δ given ε and f.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let me try to structure it properly.\n\nOriginal problem statement: \"Show that, for every nonnegative Lebesgue integrable function f:[0,1]→ℝ and every ε>0 there exists a δ>0 such that for each measurable set A⊂[0,1] with m(A)<δ, it follows that ∫_A f(x)dx < ε.\"\n\nFollowing the user's example format, the assumptions would break down the conditions:\n\n- f is nonnegative.\n- f is Lebesgue integrable on [0,1].\n- f is real-valued (i.e., f: [0,1] → ℝ).\n- ε is a positive real number.\n- A is a measurable subset of [0,1].\n- m(A) < δ.\n\nThe problem part would be: \"Prove that ∫_A f(x)dx < ε.\"\n\nBut this is not accurate because the problem is about the existence of δ, not just the inequality for given A and δ. So perhaps the problem statement in the formatted version should reflect the existence of δ. But the example didn't include the quantifiers in the problem statement; it included them in the assumptions. This seems incorrect, but following the example, perhaps that's what the user wants.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants the problem part to be the core assertion without the quantifiers, and the assumptions list all the conditions. But in this case, the core assertion is \"there exists δ>0 such that ∫_A f(x)dx < ε whenever m(A) < δ\". However, the problem is to show this given f and ε.\n\nGiven the example, perhaps the correct formatted problem is:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a nonnegative function,\nf is Lebesgue integrable on [0,1],\nf is real-valued,\nε is a positive real number,\nA is a measurable subset of [0,1],\nm(A) < δ.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ∫_A f(x)dx < ε.\n\nBut this is missing the quantifiers and the existence of δ. However, in the example, the problem part is just the assertion to be proven (expression is divisible by 91), with the quantifiers moved to assumptions. But in reality, that's not correct because the original problem's conclusion is universally quantified.\n\nGiven that the user's example seems to have a mistake but I have to follow it, I'll proceed to list all conditions as assumptions and state the problem as the core conclusion.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to list the assumptions as the hypotheses of the theorem, i.e., the conditions given on f and ε, and then the problem is to prove the existence of δ with the required property.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a nonnegative function,\nf is Lebesgue integrable on [0,1],\nf is real-valued,\nε is a positive real number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists δ > 0 such that for every measurable set A ⊂ [0,1] with m(A) < δ, ∫_A f(x)dx < ε.\n\nThis way, the assumptions list the given conditions on f and ε, and the problem is to show the existence of δ. The conditions on A and δ are part of the problem statement's conclusion.\n\nThis seems more accurate. In the example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, with the assumption that n is an integer. So in that case, the assumption is n is an integer, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. Similarly here, the assumptions are on f and ε, and the problem is to prove the existence of δ with the stated property.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a nonnegative function,\nf is Lebesgue integrable on [0,1],\nf is real-valued,\nε is a positive real number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists δ > 0 such that for every measurable set A ⊂ [0,1] with m(A) < δ, ∫_A f(x)dx < ε.\n\nThis seems to align better with mathematical rigor, where the assumptions are the hypotheses, and the problem is the conclusion to be proven.",
