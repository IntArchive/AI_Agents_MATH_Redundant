Suppose that, for any two integers $m$ and $n$ , the difference $f(m) - f(n)$ is divisible by $f(m-n)$ . Prove that, for all integers $m$ and $n$ with $f(m)<f(n)$ , the number $f(n)$ is divisible by $f(m).$ (Resource: IMO $2011$ ) My method: $$\\frac {f(m)-f(n)}{f(m-n)}\\in\\mathbb{Z}$$ If $f(m)=f(n)$ , $\\frac{f(n)}{f(m)}=1\\in \\mathbb {Z^{+}}$ I can accept $f(n)>f(m)$ .

    "AcceptedAnswer": "Your proof looks correct to me. Now,  I will prove that $f(m-n)≥f(m)$ must be. I think that you have a typo here. It should be $f(m-n)=f(m)$ . It is obvious $$\\frac {f(m)-f(n)}{f(m-n)}\\in\\mathbb{Z} \\Rightarrow \\frac {f(m)-f(m-n)}{f(n)}\\in\\mathbb{Z}$$ Yes, $f(m)-f(m-n)$ is divisible by $f(m-(m-n))=f(n)$ . If $f(m)≠f(m-n)$ , we can write $\\mid  f(m)-f(m-n) \\mid ≥f(n)$ . Considering $f(m)>0$ and $f(m-n)>0$ , we get $f(m-n)>f(m)$ must be. Because, $f(n)>f(m).$ Case $1.$ $$f(m-n)-f(m)≥f(n) $$ Case $2.$ $$f(m)=f(m-n)$$ Let $n=0$ , for Case $1$ , we can write $f(n)≤f(m-n)-f(m) \\Rightarrow f(0)≤0$ But, this is a contradiction. Because, $E(f)>0$ . So, case $1$ is impossible. I think there is no need to separate it into cases as follows : \"Suppose that $f(m)\\not =f(m-n)$ . Then, we can write $\\mid  f(m)-f(m-n) \\mid \\ge f(n)$ . Considering $f(m)>0$ and $f(m-n)>0$ , we get $f(m-n)>f(m)$ because $f(n)>f(m).$ It follows that $f(m-n)-f(m)\\ge f(n)$ . Let $n=0$ . Then, we can write $f(n)≤f(m-n)-f(m) \\implies f(0)≤0$ which contradicts $f(0)\\gt 0$ . So, we have $f(m)=f(m-n)$ .\" Another way to prove $f(m-n)=f(m)$ . We have $$-f(n)\\lt f(m)-f(n)\\le -f(m-n)\\lt 0$$ from which $$0\\lt f(m-n)\\lt f(n)$$ follows. From $$f(m)-f(m-n)\\lt f(m)+f(m-n)\\le f(n)$$ and $$f(m-n)\\lt f(n)\\lt f(n)+f(m)\\implies -f(n)\\lt f(m)-f(m-n)$$ we get $$-f(n)\\lt f(m)-f(m-n)\\lt f(n)$$ Since $f(m)-f(m-n)$ is divisible by $f(m-(m-n))=f(n)$ , we get $f(m)-f(m-n)=0$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this problem step by step. The user is asking to verify their solution to an IMO 2011 problem about a function f from integers to positive integers with a certain divisibility condition. The problem states that for any two integers m and n, the difference f(m) - f(n) is divisible by f(m - n). The goal is to prove that if f(m) < f(n), then f(n) is divisible by f(m). \n\nFirst, let me restate the problem to make sure I understand it. The function f maps integers to positive integers. The key condition is that for any integers m and n, f(m - n) divides f(m) - f(n). The task is to show that whenever f(m) < f(n), f(m) divides f(n).\n\nLooking at the user's solution, they start by noting that (f(m) - f(n))/f(m - n) is an integer. Then, they consider the case where f(m) = f(n), which would make f(n)/f(m) = 1, which is okay. They then move on to the case where f(n) > f(m). \n\nThey perform a substitution where they replace n with m - n. So, the original pair (m, n) becomes (m, m - n). This leads them to the equation (f(m) - f(m - n))/f(n) is an integer. They then argue that if f(m) ≠ f(m - n), the absolute difference |f(m) - f(m - n)| must be at least f(n). Since f(n) > f(m) (as per the assumption they're working under), and all f values are positive, they deduce that f(m - n) must be greater than f(m). \n\nThen they consider two cases: Case 1 where f(m - n) - f(m) ≥ f(n), and Case 2 where f(m) = f(m - n). They set n = 0 in Case 1, which leads to f(0) ≤ 0, contradicting the fact that f maps to positive integers. Therefore, Case 2 must hold, implying f(m) = f(m - n). Substituting back, they get that (f(m) - f(n))/f(m) is an integer, so f(n)/f(m) must be a positive integer.\n\nNow, I need to check if this reasoning is valid. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, substituting n with m - n: The original condition is for any m and n, so replacing n with m - n is allowed. The user writes:\n\nOriginal condition: (f(m) - f(n))/f(m - n) ∈ ℤ.\n\nAfter substitution (m maps to m, n maps to m - n), the new equation is (f(m) - f(m - n))/f(n) ∈ ℤ. This substitution seems correct because m - (m - n) = n, so the denominator becomes f(n).\n\nThen, the user states that if f(m) ≠ f(m - n), then |f(m) - f(m - n)| ≥ f(n). Since f(n) is positive and part of the function's codomain, which is positive integers, this makes sense because the difference of two distinct positive integers is at least 1, but here the difference must be a multiple of f(n). Wait, no. The user is assuming that if (f(m) - f(m - n))/f(n) is an integer, then if it's non-zero, the absolute value must be at least 1, so |f(m) - f(m - n)| ≥ f(n). That's correct because if the quotient is an integer, its absolute value is at least 1 unless the numerator is zero. So if f(m) ≠ f(m - n), then |f(m) - f(m - n)| must be at least f(n).\n\nThen, considering that f(n) > f(m), and since the left side |f(m) - f(m - n)| is either f(m) - f(m - n) or f(m - n) - f(m). If f(n) > f(m), then the user claims that f(m - n) > f(m) must be. Wait, how do they get that?\n\nIf |f(m) - f(m - n)| ≥ f(n), and f(n) > f(m), then the left side is either f(m) - f(m - n) or f(m - n) - f(m). If f(m) - f(m - n) is positive, then f(m) ≥ f(m - n) + f(n), but since f(n) > f(m), this would mean f(m) ≥ f(m - n) + f(n) > f(m - n) + f(m), which implies 0 > f(m - n), contradicting the positivity. Therefore, the other case must hold: f(m - n) - f(m) ≥ f(n). But since f(n) > f(m), this would imply f(m - n) ≥ f(n) + f(m) > f(m), so f(m - n) is greater than f(m). That's correct.\n\nBut then the user considers two cases. Case 1: f(m - n) - f(m) ≥ f(n), and Case 2: f(m) = f(m - n). Then, setting n = 0 in Case 1. Wait, but n was replaced by m - n earlier. Let me check this step again.\n\nWait, the substitution step was (m, n) ↦ (m, m - n), leading to (f(m) - f(m - n))/f(n) ∈ ℤ. Then, they consider if f(m) ≠ f(m - n), then |f(m) - f(m - n)| ≥ f(n). Then, under the assumption that f(n) > f(m), they conclude f(m - n) > f(m). Then, they look at Case 1: f(m - n) - f(m) ≥ f(n), which would mean f(m - n) ≥ f(n) + f(m). However, since f(n) > f(m), this implies f(m - n) is significantly larger. But then they set n = 0 in this case? Wait, how does setting n = 0 come into play here?\n\nAh, the user writes: Let n = 0, for Case 1, we can write f(n) ≤ f(m - n) - f(m) ⇒ f(0) ≤ 0. But this is a contradiction because f maps to positive integers. Therefore, Case 1 is impossible, so Case 2 must hold, i.e., f(m) = f(m - n). \n\nWait, let me parse this step. If we set n = 0 in Case 1, which states that f(m - n) - f(m) ≥ f(n), then substituting n = 0 gives f(m - 0) - f(m) ≥ f(0), which simplifies to f(m) - f(m) ≥ f(0), so 0 ≥ f(0). But f(0) is a positive integer, so this is impossible. Therefore, Case 1 leads to a contradiction when n = 0, hence Case 1 cannot occur, so we must have Case 2: f(m) = f(m - n). \n\nBut wait, the substitution of n = 0 is in the context of Case 1. However, when n = 0, the original problem's condition would involve f(m) - f(0) divisible by f(m - 0) = f(m). So (f(m) - f(0))/f(m) must be an integer, which implies that f(0) ≡ f(m) mod f(m), so f(0) must be a multiple of f(m). But f(0) is a fixed positive integer. If this is true for all m, then f(m) must divide f(0) for all m. However, the problem doesn't state that f is constant, so perhaps there's a different approach here. \n\nWait, maybe the user's reasoning here is flawed. Let's see. They take the Case 1 condition f(m - n) - f(m) ≥ f(n) and substitute n = 0 to get f(m) - f(m) ≥ f(0), leading to 0 ≥ f(0), which is a contradiction. Therefore, Case 1 cannot hold when n = 0, implying that Case 2 must hold for n = 0. However, the user's original substitution was in the context of general m and n, but when they set n = 0, are they applying it to a specific instance?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is trying to say that in the Case 1 scenario, the inequality must hold for all m and n, so even when n = 0, which leads to a contradiction. Therefore, Case 1 is impossible, and thus for all m and n with f(n) > f(m), we must have f(m) = f(m - n).\n\nBut wait, this seems too strong. Because substituting n = 0 is a specific case, but the user's Case 1 is when f(m - n) - f(m) ≥ f(n). If n is arbitrary, but in their substitution, they fix n and m. So maybe there's a misstep here. Let me think.\n\nSuppose we have f(n) > f(m). Then, using their substitution (replacing n with m - n), they get to the condition (f(m) - f(m - n))/f(n) is an integer. They then argue that if f(m) ≠ f(m - n), then |f(m) - f(m - n)| ≥ f(n). But since f(n) > f(m), they conclude that f(m - n) > f(m), so f(m - n) - f(m) ≥ f(n). Then, considering this inequality, they set n = 0, leading to 0 ≥ f(0), which is a contradiction. Hence, Case 1 is impossible, so f(m) = f(m - n).\n\nBut when they set n = 0, what does that mean in the context of the substitution? Let's be precise. Let me consider the substitution step again.\n\nOriginal substitution: They start with the condition (f(m) - f(n))/f(m - n) ∈ ℤ. Then, they perform a substitution where they replace n with m - n. So, the new variables become m' = m and n' = m - n. Then, the condition becomes (f(m') - f(n'))/f(m' - n') ∈ ℤ. But m' - n' = m - (m - n) = n. So, substituting back, the condition becomes (f(m) - f(m - n))/f(n) ∈ ℤ.\n\nSo in this new equation, m is the original m, and n is the original m - n. Wait, this might be confusing. Let me see. If we let m stay the same and replace n with m - n, then the new equation is (f(m) - f(m - n))/f(n) ∈ ℤ. This is valid because for any m and n, the original condition must hold. So the substitution is a way to generate another instance of the condition.\n\nThen, they suppose f(m) ≠ f(m - n), leading to |f(m) - f(m - n)| ≥ f(n). Given that f(n) > f(m), they analyze the possible sign of f(m) - f(m - n). Since f(n) > f(m), and |f(m) - f(m - n)| ≥ f(n), if f(m) - f(m - n) were positive, then f(m) ≥ f(m - n) + f(n). But f(n) > f(m), so f(m) ≥ f(m - n) + f(n) > f(m - n) + f(m), implying 0 ≥ f(m - n), which is impossible since f(m - n) is positive. Therefore, f(m) - f(m - n) must be negative, so f(m - n) - f(m) ≥ f(n).\n\nBut then they say, \"Let n = 0\" in Case 1. Wait, but in the current substitution, n is replaced by m - n. But if they set n = 0 in this context, what does that do? Let's see.\n\nIf in the equation f(m - n) - f(m) ≥ f(n), we set n = 0, then it becomes f(m - 0) - f(m) ≥ f(0) ⇒ f(m) - f(m) ≥ f(0) ⇒ 0 ≥ f(0). But f(0) is a positive integer, which contradicts this. Therefore, Case 1 cannot occur when n = 0. However, the user is trying to generalize this to all n, which might not be valid. Because setting n = 0 is a specific case, but the original substitution might not allow n = 0 unless certain conditions are met.\n\nWait, perhaps the key point is that if Case 1 (f(m - n) - f(m) ≥ f(n)) were possible for some m and n, then in particular, choosing n such that m - n = m (i.e., n = 0) would lead to a contradiction. Therefore, Case 1 cannot hold for any m and n where f(n) > f(m), so Case 2 must hold, meaning f(m) = f(m - n) whenever f(n) > f(m).\n\nBut is this valid? Let's consider that the user's substitution leads them to the inequality f(m - n) - f(m) ≥ f(n), and they argue that this can't hold when n = 0. However, in their substitution, n is a variable that can be set to any integer. So if they can choose n such that n = 0, then this leads to a contradiction, hence proving that Case 1 is impossible for any m and n. But does the substitution allow n = 0?\n\nWait, the original substitution was replacing n with m - n. So if we want to set n = 0 in the substituted equation, we need to see what that corresponds to in the original variables. Let's see:\n\nIn the substituted scenario, we have m' = m and n' = m - n. If we set n' = 0, then m - n = 0 ⇒ n = m. So setting n' = 0 corresponds to n = m in the original variables. But the user might be confusing the variables here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is directly substituting n = 0 into the inequality f(m - n) - f(m) ≥ f(n), leading to f(m) - f(m) ≥ f(0) ⇒ 0 ≥ f(0), which is a contradiction. Therefore, whenever we set n = 0 in Case 1, we get a contradiction, implying that Case 1 is impossible for n = 0. However, the problem statement requires that the condition holds for all integers m and n, including n = 0. Therefore, if Case 1 were possible for any m and n, it would have to hold for n = 0 as well, which it can't. Hence, Case 1 is impossible in general, so we must have Case 2: f(m) = f(m - n) whenever f(n) > f(m).\n\nAssuming this is correct, then substituting back into the original equation: (f(m) - f(n))/f(m - n) becomes (f(m) - f(n))/f(m) since f(m - n) = f(m). Therefore, (f(m) - f(n))/f(m) must be an integer. But since f(n) > f(m), the numerator is negative. However, the problem states that the difference is divisible by f(m - n), which is positive. So the quotient should be a negative integer. But the user writes that this implies f(n)/f(m) is a positive integer. Let me check.\n\nIf (f(m) - f(n))/f(m) is an integer, then (f(m) - f(n))/f(m) = 1 - f(n)/f(m). This must be an integer. Let's denote k = (f(m) - f(n))/f(m), which is an integer. Then, 1 - (f(n)/f(m)) = k ⇒ f(n)/f(m) = 1 - k. Since f(n) > f(m), f(n)/f(m) > 1, so 1 - k > 1 ⇒ -k > 0 ⇒ k < 0. Therefore, k is a negative integer. Hence, f(n)/f(m) = 1 - k, which is 1 minus a negative integer, so 1 + |k|, which is a positive integer. Therefore, f(n)/f(m) is a positive integer, as required.\n\nTherefore, the user's conclusion seems valid. However, there are a few points where the logic might be too terse or where substitutions might be confusing. For example, the step where they set n = 0 in Case 1 might need more careful justification to show that this leads to a contradiction across all applicable cases. Additionally, the substitution of variables might be better explained to avoid confusion.\n\nAnother aspect to consider is whether the conclusion that f(m - n) = f(m) whenever f(n) > f(m) holds for all m and n, or if there are constraints. For instance, if we fix m and n such that f(n) > f(m), then does f(m - n) = f(m)? If so, then by applying this recursively, perhaps we can deduce more properties about f. However, the user's solution seems to use this to directly conclude the divisibility.\n\nOverall, the user's approach appears correct, leveraging the given condition to substitute specific values and derive contradictions, thereby forcing the function to satisfy certain equalities that lead to the required divisibility. However, the presentation could be clearer, especially in justifying the substitution steps and ensuring that the cases are thoroughly analyzed without gaps.",
