    "Content": "I've seen the statement \"The matrix product of two orthogonal matrices is another orthogonal matrix. \" on Wolfram's website but haven't seen any proof online as to why this is true. By orthogonal matrix, I mean an $n \\times n$ matrix with orthonormal columns. I was working on a problem to show whether $Q^3$ is an orthogonal matrix (where $Q$ is orthogonal matrix), but I think understanding this general case would probably solve that.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If $$Q^TQ = I$$ $$R^TR = I,$$ then $$(QR)^T(QR) = (R^TQ^T)(QR) = R^T(Q^TQ)R = R^TR = I.$$ Of course, this can be extended to $n$ many matrices inductively.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to show that the product of two orthogonal matrices is also orthogonal. First, I need to recall the definition of an orthogonal matrix. An orthogonal matrix is a square matrix whose columns (and rows) are orthonormal vectors. That means when you multiply its transpose by itself, you get the identity matrix. So, if Q is orthogonal, then Q^T Q = I.\n\nNow, the problem states that if we have two orthogonal matrices, say Q and P, then their product QP should also be orthogonal. To prove this, I need to show that (QP)^T (QP) equals the identity matrix. Let's compute that. \n\nFirst, the transpose of a product of matrices is the product of their transposes in reverse order. So, (QP)^T = P^T Q^T. Then, multiplying that by QP gives P^T Q^T Q P. Since Q is orthogonal, Q^T Q is I. So this simplifies to P^T I P, which is P^T P. But since P is also orthogonal, P^T P is I. Therefore, the entire product is I, which means QP is orthogonal. \n\nWait, the example in the original problem mentions Q^3 being orthogonal. If Q is orthogonal, then Q^3 is just Q multiplied by itself three times. Using the same logic, each multiplication preserves orthogonality, so Q^3 should indeed be orthogonal. \n\nI should also check if there are any hidden assumptions here. The problem assumes that both matrices are square and of the same size since matrix multiplication requires that. Also, the definition uses orthonormal columns, which implies the matrices are square because having orthonormal columns in a non-square matrix would make it orthogonal only if it's a square matrix. So the key assumptions are that Q and P are n×n orthogonal matrices. \n\nPutting this all together, the structured problem would list those assumptions and then pose the problem of proving the product is orthogonal. Let me make sure I didn't miss any conditions. The original question didn't specify any restrictions on n, just that the matrices are n×n. The user might have thought about Q^3, but that's a specific case of multiplying three matrices. The core idea is that the product of two orthogonal matrices remains orthogonal, which hinges on the transpose and inverse properties of orthogonal matrices. \n\nAnother thing to verify is whether the user's understanding is correct. The Wolfram statement is accurate, and the proof follows from the properties of transposes and inverses. Since orthogonal matrices have inverses equal to their transposes, the product's inverse would be the product of their inverses in reverse order, which matches the transpose of the product. Hence, the product is orthogonal. \n\nSo the assumptions are straightforward: both matrices are orthogonal, they are square, and the product is defined (same dimensions). The problem then is to prove that their product is also orthogonal. That should cover everything the user needs to structure their question properly.",
