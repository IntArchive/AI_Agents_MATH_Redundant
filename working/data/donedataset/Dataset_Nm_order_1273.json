    "Content": "This question at MathOverflow conjectures certain relation between fast converging hypergeometric series and Gieseking's constant . The Gieseking constant ( $G$ ) is the volume of the hyperbolic $3$ -manifold, also called Gieseking's manifold . The hypergeometric series under consideration has trigonometric integral representations, which give two different forms of the conjecture: $$\\int_0^{{\\pi }/{3}} \\frac{x \\left({\\sqrt{3}-{\\sin x}}\\right)\\, dx}{\\sin x \\cdot \\sqrt{3-2 \\sqrt{3} \\sin x}}\\overset{?}{=}\\frac{5}{2}\\text{Im}\\left(\\text{Li}_2\\left(e^{\\frac{2 i \\pi }{3}}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{5}{3}G\\tag{1}$$ $$\n\\int_0^{{\\pi }/{3}} P(x)\\, \\frac{xdx}{\\sin x \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4}-\\sin ^2x}}\\overset{?}{=}5 \\sqrt[4]{3}\\, \\rm{Im}\\left(\\rm{Li}_2\\left(e^{\\frac{2 i \\pi }{3}}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{10\\sqrt[4]{3}}{3} G \\tag{2}\n$$ where, $$P(x)=\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}-\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4}-\\sin ^2x}\\right)^{3/2}+\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}+\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4}-\\sin ^2x}\\right)^{3/2}$$ The 2nd representation is interesting because Lobachevsky has studied similar integrals in relation to volumes in hyperbolic geometry in his work \"Application of imaginary geometry to certain integrals\" (1836). Also see equation 3.842.7 in Gradshteyn and Ryzhik. For example he proves the following integration formula: $$\\int_0^\\beta \\frac{x\\sin x\\, dx}{(1-\\sin^2 \\alpha \\sin^2 x)\\sqrt{\\sin^2 \\beta -\\sin^2 x}} = \\frac{\\pi\\ln\\frac{\\cos \\alpha +\\sqrt{1-\\sin^2\\alpha \\sin^2\\beta}}{2\\cos \\beta \\cos^2 \\frac{\\alpha}{2}}}{2\\cos \\alpha \\sqrt{1-\\sin^2\\alpha \\sin^2 \\beta}}$$ This formula in the limit $\\alpha\\to\\pm i\\infty $ becomes $$\n\\int_0^\\beta\\frac{xdx}{\\sin{x}\\sqrt{\\sin^2{\\beta}-\\sin^2{x}}}=\\frac{\\pi}{4\\sin{\\beta}}\\ln{\\frac{1+\\sin{\\beta}}{1-\\sin{\\beta}}}.\\tag{3}\n$$ One can see that when $\\beta=\\pi/3$ , then both (2) and (3) have the same factor $\\frac{x}{\\sin{x}\\sqrt{\\sin^2{\\beta}-\\sin^2{x}}}$ , and if it wasn't for the convoluted factor $P(x)$ these integrals would be the same. Lobachevsky also studied other integrals and in particular he shows that the integral with the variable upper limit $y<\\beta$ $$\n\\int_0^y\\frac{xdx}{\\sin{x}\\sqrt{\\sin^2{\\beta}-\\sin^2{x}}}\n$$ can be expressed as a sum of elementary functions and Clausen functions. Maybe (2) is related to hyperbolic geometry and there is certain substitution that can transform this integral into a sum of Clausen functions or maybe it has some geometric interpretation? Q: How to prove conjectures (1) and (2)?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Both integrals are essentially some obscure variants of the Ahmed or Coxeter integral (as observed from a comment I left under the question several years ago). As such, the approach outlined here fits well - namely, bringing the integral to a form where we can utilize the following identity: $$\\int_a^b \\frac{\\arctan\\left(f(x)\\frac{\\sqrt{g(x)}}{\\sqrt{h(x)}} \\right)}{p(x)\\sqrt{g(x)}\\sqrt{h(x)}}dx=\\int_a^b \\frac{1}{p(x)}\\int_0^{f(x)} \\frac{1}{h(x)+g(x)y^2}dydx$$ We will start by calculating the second integral, as it's smoother to deal with directly compared to the first integral. At the end of the post, we will also show how to connect the two integrals.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question according to the given format. Let me first read through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe question is about proving two integral conjectures related to Gieseking's constant. The user mentions two integrals, equations (1) and (2), which they suspect are equal to expressions involving the imaginary part of the dilogarithm function evaluated at a complex point, which in turn relates to Gieseking's constant G. The problem also references Lobachevsky's work on similar integrals connected to hyperbolic geometry and some formulas from Gradshteyn and Ryzhik. The main task is to prove these two integral equalities.\n\nNow, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. The example provided shows that each assumption is a single property or condition applied to one object. Let's see:\n\n1. The problem involves integrals from 0 to π/3. So the limits of integration for both integrals are from 0 to π/3. That's an assumption about the integral bounds.\n\n2. The integrands for both (1) and (2) have specific forms. For equation (1), the integrand is [x (sqrt(3) - sin x)] / [sin x * sqrt(3 - 2 sqrt(3) sin x)]. For equation (2), the integrand is P(x) * [x dx / (sin x sqrt(3/4 - sin²x))], where P(x) is a combination of square roots raised to the 3/2 power. So these expressions define the integrands, which are conditions on how the integrals are structured.\n\n3. The conjectures state that these integrals equal 5/3 G and 10*3^(1/4)/3 G, respectively. However, in the example, the assumption included conditions on variables (like n being an integer and divisible by 7). Here, the problem is to prove the equality, so the conjectured equalities themselves are part of the problem statement, not assumptions. The assumptions would be the given forms of the integrals and any underlying conditions necessary for their evaluation (like the domain of integration, the functions involved being integrable, etc.).\n\nWait, the problem mentions that Lobachevsky studied similar integrals, and there's a formula involving beta and alpha. However, the user is asking to prove (1) and (2). The assumptions should be the given expressions in the integrals and any necessary conditions for their validity. The problem statement is to prove those equalities. The example included assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, perhaps the key assumptions are the integral limits and the structure of the integrands. Let me parse that.\n\nLooking at the example again, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So each assumption is a separate line, each addressing one property. For the current problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- The integral in equation (1) is from 0 to π/3.\n- The integrand in equation (1) is [x (√3 - sin x)] / [sin x * √(3 - 2√3 sin x)].\n- The integral in equation (2) is from 0 to π/3.\n- The integrand in equation (2) involves P(x) * [x / (sin x √(3/4 - sin²x))].\n- P(x) is defined as [√3/2 - √(3/4 - sin²x)]^(3/2) + [√3/2 + √(3/4 - sin²x)]^(3/2).\n- The conjectured results relate these integrals to 5/3 G and 10*3^(1/4)/3 G respectively, where G is Gieseking's constant.\n\nBut wait, the conjectured equalities are part of what needs to be proven, so they should be in the problem statement. The assumptions are the given conditions. So the assumptions would include the definitions of the integrals, their integrands, and the domain of integration.\n\nSo each integral's structure is part of the assumptions. Let me list them:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- For equation (1): The integral is ∫₀^{π/3} [x(√3 - sin x)] / [sin x √(3 - 2√3 sin x)] dx.\n\n- For equation (2): The integral is ∫₀^{π/3} P(x) [x / (sin x √(3/4 - sin²x))] dx, where P(x) is [√3/2 - √(3/4 - sin²x)]^(3/2) + [√3/2 + √(3/4 - sin²x)]^(3/2).\n\nAdditionally, the problem might assume the validity of the integral expressions (i.e., convergence), but since the user is asking to prove the equalities, perhaps those are the only explicit assumptions.\n\nSo, structuring the assumptions line by line:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe first integral is ∫₀^{π/3} [x(√3 - sin x)] / [sin x √(3 - 2√3 sin x)] dx,\n\nThe second integral is ∫₀^{π/3} P(x) [x / (sin x √(3/4 - sin²x))] dx,\n\nP(x) = (√3/2 - √(3/4 - sin²x))^{3/2} + (√3/2 + √(3/4 - sin²x))^{3/2},\n\nG is Gieseking's constant,\n\nIm(Li₂(e^{2iπ/3})) = (2/5)(5/3 G) [Wait, no. The conjectured equalities are that the integrals equal 5/3 G and 10*3^{1/4}/3 G. However, the problem states that 5/2 Im(Li₂(...)) equals 5/3 G, which is part of the conjecture. Since the problem is to prove the integrals equal those expressions, maybe the relation between Im(Li₂(...)) and G is an established identity? But the user presents it as part of the conjecture. Hmm. The example didn't include the target equality as an assumption. The original problem had to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, so the assumptions were on n. Here, the conjectures are that the integrals equal certain expressions involving G. So perhaps the assumptions are only about the integrals' structure and definitions, not the equalities themselves. So the problem is to show that those integrals equal the given expressions. Hence, the assumptions are the definitions of the integrals and P(x), and the problem is to prove those equalities.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\n\nFor equation (1), the integral is ∫₀^{π/3} [x(√3 - sin x)] / [sin x √(3 - 2√3 sin x)] dx,\n\nFor equation (2), the integral is ∫₀^{π/3} P(x) [x / (sin x √(3/4 - sin²x))] dx,\n\nP(x) is defined as (√3/2 - √(3/4 - sin²x))^{3/2} + (√3/2 + √(3/4 - sin²x))^{3/2},\n\nG is Gieseking's constant,\n\nIm(Li₂(e^{2iπ/3})) is a known value related to G.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the user says the conjectures are that the integrals equal those expressions. So perhaps the relation between Im(Li₂(...)) and G is an established identity, hence part of the problem's context. But in the example, the assumption was about n, and the problem was to prove divisibility. Here, the problem is to show the integrals equal those expressions. So the assumptions are the integral expressions, and the problem is to prove they equal the given values. However, in the example, the problem statement included the divisibility claim. So here, the problem is to prove the integrals equal the right-hand sides. Thus, the problem part would include both integrals and their conjectured equalities.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions are the conditions given, and the problem is the actual question. So in the original example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7. In this case, the problem is to prove that the integrals (1) and (2) equal those expressions involving G. Therefore, the assumptions are the definitions of the integrals, the form of P(x), and that G is Gieseking's constant. Wait, but G being Gieseking's constant is just a definition. Maybe not an assumption, but part of the problem statement. Hmm.\n\nWait, the example's assumption listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as two separate assumptions. Similarly, here, the assumptions would be about the integrals, their limits, integrands, and P(x)'s definition. Let me try to list them:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe first integral is from 0 to π/3,\n\nThe integrand of the first integral is [x(√3 - sin x)] / [sin x √(3 - 2√3 sin x)],\n\nThe second integral is from 0 to π/3,\n\nThe integrand of the second integral is P(x) times [x / (sin x √(3/4 - sin²x))],\n\nP(x) is defined as (√3/2 - √(3/4 - sin²x))^(3/2) + (√3/2 + √(3/4 - sin²x))^(3/2),\n\nGieseking's constant G is the volume of the hyperbolic 3-manifold,\n\nIm(Li₂(e^{2iπ/3})) is related to G via Im(Li₂(e^{2iπ/3})) = (2/5)(5/3 G) [Wait, no. The problem says 5/2 Im(...) = 5/3 G, so Im(...) = (5/3 G) * 2/5 = 2/3 G. But perhaps that's part of the problem's equalities, not assumptions. The problem states the conjectures are that the integrals equal those expressions. So the assumptions are just the setup of the integrals and P(x). The problem is to show that these integrals equal those expressions, which are given in terms of Im(Li₂(...)) and G.\n\nTherefore, the problem statement would be: Prove that integral (1) equals (5/3)G and integral (2) equals (10*3^{1/4}/3)G.\n\nBut how to structure that concisely. The user's example had a single problem statement. Here, there are two integrals to prove. So perhaps the problem is to prove both conjectures (1) and (2).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAssumptions:\n\nEach integral is from 0 to π/3,\n\nThe integrand of the first integral is [x(√3 - sin x)] / [sin x √(3 - 2√3 sin x)],\n\nThe integrand of the second integral is P(x) [x / (sin x √(3/4 - sin²x))],\n\nP(x) = (√3/2 - √(3/4 - sin²x))^(3/2) + (√3/2 + √(3/4 - sin²x))^(3/2),\n\nG is Gieseking's constant,\n\nIm(Li₂(e^{2iπ/3})) is a known imaginary part of the dilogarithm function.\n\nProblem: Prove that integral (1) equals (5/3)G and integral (2) equals (10*3^{1/4}/3)G.\n\nBut according to the example, assumptions are only the conditions given, not the definitions. For instance, in the example, n being an integer and divisible by 7 are assumptions, while the problem is to prove divisibility by 91.\n\nHere, the problem is to prove the integrals equal certain values. The definitions of G and Li₂ are part of the problem context, not assumptions. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe first integral is ∫₀^{π/3} [x(√3 - sin x)] / [sin x √(3 - 2√3 sin x)] dx,\n\nThe second integral is ∫₀^{π/3} P(x) [x / (sin x √(3/4 - sin²x))] dx,\n\nP(x) is defined as (√3/2 - √(3/4 - sin²x))^(3/2) + (√3/2 + √(3/4 - sin²x))^(3/2),\n\nG is Gieseking's constant.\n\nProblem: Prove that ∫₀^{π/3} [x(√3 - sin x)] / [sin x √(3 - 2√3 sin x)] dx = (5/3)G and ∫₀^{π/3} P(x) [x / (sin x √(3/4 - sin²x))] dx = (10*3^{1/4}/3)G.\n\nBut the problem statement in the example had the problem part as \"Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" Here, it's two integrals, so perhaps the problem is to prove both conjectures (1) and (2), which are stated as equations. However, the original problem also mentions that the conjectures relate the integrals to those expressions involving G, so the problem is to show those equalities.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe first integral is ∫₀^{π/3} [x(√3 - sin x)] / [sin x √(3 - 2√3 sin x)] dx,\n\nThe second integral is ∫₀^{π/3} P(x) [x / (sin x √(3/4 - sin²x))] dx,\n\nP(x) is defined as (√3/2 - √(3/4 - sin²x))^(3/2) + (√3/2 + √(3/4 - sin²x))^(3/2),\n\nG is Gieseking's constant.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that  \n1. ∫₀^{π/3} [x(√3 - sin x)] / [sin x √(3 - 2√3 sin x)] dx = (5/3)G,  \n2. ∫₀^{π/3} P(x) [x / (sin x √(3/4 - sin²x))] dx = (10*3^{1/4}/3)G.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem mentions two conjectures (1) and (2), the problem could be stated as proving those two conjectures. But the example's problem part was concise, so perhaps listing both equations as the problem.\n\nYes, I think that's the correct structure.",
