    "AcceptedAnswer": "A set in $X\\times Y$ is open iff it is the union of sets of type $U\\times V$ with $U,V$ open. Therefore, if $(x,y)\\notin\\overline{A\\times B}$, there is $U\\times V$ containing it and disjoint to $A\\times B$. \nAs $(U\\cap A)\\times (V\\cap B)\\subseteq (U\\times V)\\cap (A\\times B)$, one of the sets $U\\cap A$ or $V\\cap B$ is empty, i.e. $x\\notin \\overline A$ or $y\\notin \\overline B$.\nThis shows $\\overline A\\times\\overline B \\subseteq \\overline{A\\times B}$.\nThe converse is not much different.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The question is to show that the closure of the product of two sets A and B in the product topology X×Y is equal to the product of their closures, that is, cl(A×B) = cl(A) × cl(B). \n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic concepts about closures and product topologies. The closure of a set is the smallest closed set containing it, which is the same as the set plus all its limit points. In product topologies, the open sets are generated by the basis of open rectangles, i.e., products of open sets from X and Y. But I think closed sets in the product topology aren't just products of closed sets; they can be more complicated. However, the closure operation might interact nicely with products.\n\nLet me start by trying to prove one inclusion: cl(A×B) ⊆ cl(A)×cl(B). Suppose (x,y) is in cl(A×B). Then every open neighborhood around (x,y) in X×Y intersects A×B. Take a basic open neighborhood around (x,y), which is of the form U×V where U is open in X and V is open in Y. Since (x,y) is in cl(A×B), U×V intersects A×B. So there exists some (a,b) in A×B such that a is in U and b is in V. This implies that U intersects A and V intersects B. Therefore, x is in cl(A) because every open U around x intersects A, and similarly y is in cl(B). Hence, (x,y) is in cl(A)×cl(B). So that shows cl(A×B) ⊆ cl(A)×cl(B).\n\nNow for the reverse inclusion: cl(A)×cl(B) ⊆ cl(A×B). Take (x,y) in cl(A)×cl(B), so x is in cl(A) and y is in cl(B). We need to show that every open neighborhood around (x,y) intersects A×B. Let W be an open neighborhood of (x,y) in X×Y. Since we're in the product topology, W contains a basic open set U×V containing (x,y), where U is open in X and V is open in Y. Since x is in cl(A), U intersects A, so there's some a in A ∩ U. Similarly, since y is in cl(B), V intersects B, so there's some b in B ∩ V. Therefore, (a,b) is in (A×B) ∩ (U×V), which is a subset of (A×B) ∩ W. Hence, every neighborhood of (x,y) intersects A×B, so (x,y) is in cl(A×B). Thus, cl(A)×cl(B) ⊆ cl(A×B).\n\nPutting both inclusions together, we get cl(A×B) = cl(A)×cl(B). \n\nWait, but I need to check if there are any hidden assumptions here. The problem states that A is a subset of X and B is a subset of Y, where X and Y are topological spaces. The product topology is assumed here, right? So the key properties used are that closures behave well under projections, and that the product of closures is closed. Let me confirm: the product of two closed sets is closed in the product topology. Since cl(A) is closed in X and cl(B) is closed in Y, cl(A)×cl(B) is closed in X×Y. Also, since A×B is a subset of cl(A)×cl(B), which is closed, then the closure of A×B must be a subset of cl(A)×cl(B). For the reverse, we showed that any point in cl(A)×cl(B) is a limit point of A×B. So the argument seems solid. \n\nI don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. Maybe to be thorough, consider an example. Let X=Y=ℝ with the usual topology. Let A=(0,1), B=(0,1). Then cl(A×B)= [0,1]×[0,1], which is cl(A)×cl(B). If A is not closed, like a single point, say A={(0,0)} in ℝ², but wait, no, in the product topology, points are closed if the space is Hausdorff, but maybe that's complicating. The problem doesn't specify any separation axioms, so the argument should hold generally. \n\nTherefore, the proof seems correct as per the product topology definitions and properties of closures.",
