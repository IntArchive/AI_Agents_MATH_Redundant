    "Content": "In Elias Stein and Rami Shakarchi's Complex Analysis textbook, we have the following exercise: Show that if $\\{a_n\\}_{n=0}^\\infty$ is a sequence of complex numbers such that $$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{|a_{n+1}|}{|a_n|}=L,$$ then $$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}|a_n|^{1/n}=L.$$ I've been trying to prove this with no luck. The only thing I've thought of doing is $$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\left(\\frac{|a_{n+1}|^n}{|a_n|^n}\\right)^{1/n},$$but this hasn't lead me anywhere except dead ends. Will someone provide a hint for me about how to proceed? Thanks! Minor update: I don't know if it's helpful yet, but I know we can write the limit as $$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\left(\\frac{|a_{n+1}a_n\\cdots a_0|}{|a_n\\cdots a_0|}\\cdot\\frac{1}{|a_n|}\\right).$$This reminds me a lot of the geometric mean, which even has the exponents I'm trying to get...",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So the user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure with assumptions and the problem statement. The example provided shows that assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The title is \"Convergence of Ratio Test implies Convergence of the Root Test\". The problem states that if the limit of |a_{n+1}| / |a_n| as n approaches infinity is L, then the limit of |a_n|^{1/n} is also L. The user tried some approaches but didn't succeed and is asking for a hint.\n\nNow, the task is to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. The example given had assumptions listed as two lines: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Each assumption is a single property of one object.\n\nLooking at the problem here, the key assumptions are about the sequence {a_n} of complex numbers. The main condition given is that the limit of the ratio |a_{n+1}| / |a_n| as n approaches infinity is L. Are there any other implicit assumptions? For the ratio test, typically we assume that a_n is non-zero for all sufficiently large n to avoid division by zero. The problem mentions \"complex numbers\" but doesn't specify if a_n is non-zero. However, since the ratio |a_{n+1}| / |a_n| is given, it's implied that a_n ≠ 0 for all n beyond some point. So that's an important assumption.\n\nSo the assumptions should include:\n\n1. {a_n} is a sequence of complex numbers.\n2. For all sufficiently large n, |a_n| ≠ 0.\n3. The limit L = lim_{n→∞} |a_{n+1}| / |a_n| exists.\n\nEach of these is a separate line addressing one property or condition. The problem statement then is to show that lim_{n→∞} |a_n|^{1/n} = L.\n\nWait, the original problem in the example included assumptions that were more specific. In their example, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but the original problem only stated \"for every integer n\". However, the formatted problem added an assumption about divisibility by 7. Wait, that seems like a mistake. Wait, no, looking back, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. But the original problem didn't mention that. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect, but I need to follow the user's instruction. However, in their example, they modified the original problem's assumptions. But perhaps in this case, the user wants me to extract the explicit assumptions from the problem as stated, not add new ones. Wait, no. The example shows that sometimes the formatted problem includes assumptions that were not explicitly stated but are necessary. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe that example was a mistake, but since the user provided it, I need to follow their approach. However, in the current problem, the original question states the assumptions explicitly: {a_n} is a sequence of complex numbers, and the limit of the ratio is L. But the ratio requires that a_n is non-zero for large n. So that's an implicit assumption. So in the formatted problem, the assumptions should include that a_n is non-zero for sufficiently large n. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- {a_n} is a sequence of complex numbers.\n- For all sufficiently large n, |a_n| ≠ 0.\n- The limit lim_{n→∞} |a_{n+1}| / |a_n| = L exists.\n\nEach of these is a separate line. Then the problem is to prove that lim |a_n|^{1/n} = L.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is one line, one property. So breaking down:\n\n1. {a_n} is a sequence of complex numbers.\n2. For all sufficiently large n, |a_n| ≠ 0.\n3. lim_{n→∞} (|a_{n+1}| / |a_n|) = L.\n\nProblem: Prove that lim_{n→∞} |a_n|^{1/n} = L.\n\nThat should be the structured format. Let me check the example again. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. The original problem was \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added the divisibility by 7. Wait, perhaps the example was incorrectly structured, but the user provided it as their own example, so maybe they intended to include additional assumptions. However, in the current problem, we should stick to the given problem's explicit and necessary implicit assumptions. The user's example might have been a specific case, but here the problem is general. Therefore, the correct assumptions are the three I listed.",
