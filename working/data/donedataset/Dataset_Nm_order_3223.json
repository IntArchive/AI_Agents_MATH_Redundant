    "Content": "I am now doing Hartshorne Problem 1.2.6. Hartshorne 1.2.6: Let $Y$ be a projective variety with homogeneous coordinate ring $S(Y)$, show that $\\dim S(Y) = \\dim Y + 1$. [Hint: Let $\\varphi_i : U_i \\to \\Bbb{A}^n$ be the homeomorphism of (2.2), let $Y_i$ be the affine variety $\\varphi(Y \\cap U_i)$ be its affine coordinate ring. Show that $A(Y_i)$ can be identified with the subring of elements of degree $0$ of the localized ring $S(Y)_{x_i}$. Then show that $S(Y)_{x_i} \\cong A(Y_i)[x_i,x_i^{-1}]$. Now I have done most of the exercise but have several questions related to it: The notation $S(Y)_{x_i}$ means localization at the multiplicative set $\\{1,x_i,x_i^2,\\ldots\\}$ yes? It does not mean localization at the prime ideal $ (x_i)$ right? I don't think the two coincide. Assuming I understand the notation right, I am confused how we can just do $S(Y)_{x_i}$ without some extra assumptions. In particular it could be that $x_i$ is zero in $S(Y)$, i.e. $x_i \\in I(Y)$ then we are in trouble because the localization is the zero ring. Should there be an extra assumption here? Also how can I say that $S(Y)_{x_i} \\cong A(Y_i)[x_i,x_i^{-1}]$? I know how to prove this if $S(Y)$ is a $\\Bbb{Z}$ - graded ring but now it is just a $\\Bbb{N}$ - graded ring.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Yes, $S(Y)_{x_i}$ means localization at the multiplicative set $\\{1,x_i,x_i^2,\\ldots\\}$ . Not only does it not coincide with $S(Y)_{(x_i) }$ but in a sense it is complementary, as seen in the following affine example: Let $\\mathbb A^1_k=\\text{Spec}(k[T])$ . Then $k[T]_T$ is the ring of regular functions on $\\mathbb A^1_k\\setminus \\{0\\}$ ,i.e. defined outside $0\\in \\mathbb A^1_k$ , whereas $k[T]_{(T)}$ is the ring of germs of functions defined only near $0\\in \\mathbb A^1_k$ . You are very attentive: congratulations! But Hartshorne's isomorphism is correct: if $x_i\\in I(Y)$ , then $Y$ is contained in the hyperplane $H_i\\subset \\mathbb P^n_k$ given by $x_i=0$ . Since $Y\\subset H_i=\\mathbb P^n_k\\setminus U_i$ ,  its   intersection with $U_i$ is empty: $Y_i=Y\\cap U_i=\\emptyset$ . The ring of functions of $Y_i$ is thus zero: $A(Y_i)=0$ , and since $S(Y)_{x_i}=0$ too because you are inverting $x_i=0\\in S(Y)$ Hartshorne's isomorphisms reduces to $0\\cong 0 :$ not exciting but true! As you correctly write in your comment below, you may use that for a $\\mathbb Z$ -graded ring $R$ and a homogeneous element $f\\in R_1$ of degree $1$ you have  the isomorphism of $\\mathbb Z$ -graded rings $$(R[f^{-1}]_0)[x,x^{-1}]\\stackrel {\\cong}{\\to}  R[f^{-1}]:\\sum_{j\\in \\mathbb Z} q_jx^j\\mapsto \\sum_{j\\in \\mathbb Z} q_j f^j   \\quad (q_j\\in R[f^{-1}]_0)   $$ You would like to apply this to $R=S(Y)$ and $f=x_i$ , but there is the apparent difficulty that $S(Y)$ is $\\mathbb N$ -graded instead of being $\\mathbb Z$ -graded. The solution is purely formal: just decree that $S(Y)_n=0$ for $n\\lt 0$ and $S(Y)$ becomes a $\\mathbb Z$ - graded ring. This is a general formal procedure allowing to consider any $\\mathbb N$ - graded ring as a $\\mathbb Z$ - graded ring.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this Math Stack Exchange question step by step. The user is working on Hartshorne's Exercise 1.2.6, which involves showing that the dimension of the homogeneous coordinate ring S(Y) of a projective variety Y is equal to the dimension of Y plus 1. They have some specific questions about notation and steps in the problem.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the key components of the problem and the user's specific questions. The main problem is to prove that dim S(Y) = dim Y + 1. The user is following the hint provided by Hartshorne, which involves using the maps φ_i, affine varieties Y_i, and localizing the ring S(Y) at x_i. \n\nThe user has several points of confusion:\n\n1. Clarification about the notation S(Y)_{x_i}: They want to confirm that this refers to localization at the multiplicative set {1, x_i, x_i^2, ...} rather than at the prime ideal (x_i). They also mention that these two localizations are different, which is correct because localizing at a multiplicative set is not the same as localizing at a prime ideal.\n\n2. Concerns about the possibility that x_i might be zero in S(Y), which would make the localization the zero ring. They question if there's an implicit assumption that x_i is not in the ideal I(Y), ensuring it's non-zero in S(Y).\n\n3. How to establish the isomorphism S(Y)_{x_i} ≅ A(Y_i)[x_i, x_i^{-1}], especially considering that S(Y) is an N-graded ring rather than a Z-graded ring. The user is familiar with how this works for Z-graded rings but is unsure about the N-graded case.\n\nNow, to structure this according to the required format. The Assumptions should list each individual condition or property applied to one object. The Problem is the main statement to prove.\n\nStarting with the original problem statement: Show that dim S(Y) = dim Y + 1 where Y is a projective variety with homogeneous coordinate ring S(Y).\n\nThe user's specific questions involve the notation and conditions for the localization S(Y)_{x_i}. So, the assumptions here would include the definitions and conditions necessary for the problem. \n\nFirst, Y is a projective variety, so that's an assumption. The homogeneous coordinate ring S(Y) is defined as the graded ring k[x_0, ..., x_n]/I(Y), where I(Y) is the homogeneous ideal. The maps φ_i are homeomorphisms from U_i to A^n, and Y_i is the affine variety φ(Y ∩ U_i). The affine coordinate ring A(Y_i) is the coordinate ring of this affine variety. \n\nThe problem involves showing that A(Y_i) can be identified with the subring of elements of degree 0 in S(Y)_{x_i}, then that S(Y)_{x_i} is isomorphic to A(Y_i)[x_i, x_i^{-1}]. The user's confusion is about the localization S(Y)_{x_i} and whether there's an assumption that x_i is not in I(Y), i.e., that x_i is non-zero in S(Y). \n\nSo, possible assumptions would include that Y is a projective variety, S(Y) is its homogeneous coordinate ring, the localization S(Y)_{x_i} is at the multiplicative set {1, x_i, x_i^2, ...}, and that x_i is not in I(Y) (to avoid trivial localization). However, in the original problem statement, Hartshorne might assume that Y is non-empty and that the projective variety is embedded in projective space with coordinates x_0, ..., x_n, so that each x_i is not vanishing entirely on Y, hence x_i is not in I(Y). But the user is pointing out that if x_i were in I(Y), then S(Y)_{x_i} would be the zero ring, so there must be an implicit assumption here. \n\nTherefore, the assumption should include that x_i is not in I(Y) to ensure that the localization is non-trivial. Additionally, since the problem is about projective varieties, which are irreducible, but maybe the user hasn't mentioned that, but perhaps Hartshorne's definition includes irreducibility. But the user hasn't specified that, so maybe we don't need to include that unless necessary. \n\nAnother point is about S(Y) being N-graded. The isomorphism S(Y)_{x_i} ≅ A(Y_i)[x_i, x_i^{-1}] might require that S(Y) is a graded ring, which it is by definition as a homogeneous coordinate ring. \n\nSo putting this all together, the assumptions would be:\n\n- Y is a projective variety.\n- S(Y) is the homogeneous coordinate ring of Y.\n- The localization S(Y)_{x_i} is at the multiplicative set {1, x_i, x_i^2, ...}.\n- x_i is not an element of the ideal I(Y) (to ensure S(Y)_{x_i} is non-zero).\n- S(Y) is an N-graded ring.\n\nBut in the original problem statement, some of these might be implicit. For example, the fact that Y is a projective variety already implies that S(Y) is the homogeneous coordinate ring. The problem's hint leads to considering the localization at x_i, which requires x_i not being in I(Y). However, the original problem as stated by Hartshorne might not explicitly state that x_i is not in I(Y), but in practice, for projective varieties embedded in P^n, the coordinates x_i do not vanish on the entire variety (else, the variety would lie in the hyperplane x_i=0, but projective varieties can have multiple components, but maybe in Hartshorne's definition, varieties are irreducible, so they can't be contained in the hyperplane x_i=0 unless they are equal to it, but if Y is a projective variety in P^n, then x_i vanishing on Y would mean Y is contained in the hyperplane x_i=0, but maybe the problem assumes that Y is not contained in any hyperplane? Or perhaps the problem is considering the standard open cover where each U_i is the complement of the hyperplane x_i=0, so Y ∩ U_i is non-empty, hence x_i is not in I(Y). Because if Y ∩ U_i were empty, then Y would be contained in the hyperplane x_i=0, making x_i vanish on Y, but since the problem is using the homeomorphism φ_i on Y ∩ U_i, it's assuming that Y ∩ U_i is non-empty, hence x_i is not in I(Y). Therefore, perhaps the assumption that Y is not contained in any hyperplane x_i=0 is implicit, or that each Y ∩ U_i is non-empty. \n\nBut since the user is specifically worried about x_i being in I(Y), which would make S(Y)_{x_i} zero, the problem must be assuming that x_i is not in I(Y). Therefore, this is an assumption that needs to be listed. \n\nNow, the problem statement as given by the user is to show dim S(Y) = dim Y + 1. The user's specific questions are about the localization steps, but the main problem to structure is the original problem from Hartshorne. However, the user is asking about their specific confusions regarding the notation and conditions. \n\nBut according to the example given, the formatted problem should include the problem statement and the assumptions. The example took the original problem, listed assumptions, and then the problem. In the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but the user restructured it to list the assumptions. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem listed assumptions as n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, it was for every integer n, so perhaps the example had a mistake, or maybe there was a misunderstanding. Wait, let me check the example again.\n\nThe example says:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, it's for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so there's no restriction, but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which changes the problem. This seems like a mistake in the example. So perhaps the user wants to list the assumptions that are implicit in the problem, even if they are not stated. But in this case, the example might be wrong.\n\nGiven that, perhaps in the current problem, we need to list the assumptions as per the user's concerns. The user is pointing out that unless x_i is not in I(Y), the localization S(Y)_{x_i} would be zero, which would be a problem. Therefore, the assumption needed is that x_i is not in I(Y). But in Hartshorne's problem, is this assumption made? \n\nIn Hartshorne's exercise, Y is a projective variety in P^n, and U_i is the open set where x_i ≠ 0. The map φ_i is from U_i to A^n, and Y_i = φ(Y ∩ U_i). If Y ∩ U_i is empty, then Y is contained in the hyperplane x_i = 0, which would mean x_i is in I(Y). But in that case, the problem would not make sense because S(Y)_{x_i} would be zero. Therefore, the problem must be assuming that Y is not contained in any hyperplane x_i = 0, or that for each i, Y ∩ U_i is non-empty. However, in general, a projective variety might be contained in some hyperplanes. \n\nBut perhaps in the context of Hartshorne's problem, the variety Y is such that it intersects each U_i, but that's not necessarily true. Therefore, the problem might have an implicit assumption that Y is non-degenerate, or maybe the problem is considering a specific i where Y ∩ U_i is non-empty. But since the problem is about projective varieties in general, the user is correct to question this. Therefore, to make the problem well-posed, we need to assume that x_i is not in I(Y), i.e., Y is not contained in the hyperplane x_i=0. \n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- Y is a projective variety.\n- The homogeneous coordinate ring of Y is S(Y).\n- The localization S(Y)_{x_i} is at the multiplicative set {1, x_i, x_i^2, ...}.\n- x_i is not an element of the ideal I(Y) (so that S(Y)_{x_i} is non-zero).\n- S(Y) is an N-graded ring.\n\nThe problem is to show that dim S(Y) = dim Y + 1.\n\nBut the user's specific questions also involve the isomorphism S(Y)_{x_i} ≅ A(Y_i)[x_i, x_i^{-1}]. However, in the original problem, the main task is to prove dim S(Y) = dim Y + 1. The user's questions are about intermediate steps, but the formatted problem should focus on the original problem's statement and its assumptions. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list the necessary assumptions for the problem to hold, including that x_i is not in I(Y) to avoid trivial localization. But in Hartshorne's problem, is this assumption explicitly stated? The original problem says \"Let Y be a projective variety...\", so unless Y is contained in a hyperplane, x_i is not in I(Y). However, the problem might be considering a general projective variety, which could be contained in a hyperplane. Therefore, to make the problem's hint valid, we must assume that Y is not contained in the hyperplane x_i = 0, i.e., x_i ∉ I(Y). \n\nAdditionally, the problem might be assuming that Y is irreducible, as varieties in Hartshorne are often assumed to be irreducible. But the user didn't mention that, so maybe not. \n\nPutting this all together, the assumptions would be:\n\n- Y is a projective variety.\n- The homogeneous coordinate ring of Y is S(Y) = k[x_0, ..., x_n]/I(Y), where I(Y) is the homogeneous ideal.\n- For the index i, x_i is not an element of I(Y).\n- The localization S(Y)_{x_i} is taken with respect to the multiplicative set {1, x_i, x_i^2, ...}.\n- S(Y) is an N-graded ring.\n\nThe problem is to prove that dim S(Y) = dim Y + 1.\n\nHowever, the user's original problem statement in the Title and Question mentions Hartshorne Exercise 1.2.6, which is to show dim S(Y) = dim Y + 1. The user's specific questions are about the localization steps, but the formatted problem should capture the original problem's statement and its necessary assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem would list the assumptions needed for the problem to hold, particularly addressing the user's concern about x_i not being in I(Y) to ensure the localization is non-trivial.
