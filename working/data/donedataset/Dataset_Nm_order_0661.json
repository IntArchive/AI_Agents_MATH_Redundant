    "AcceptedAnswer": "Notice that $m!n!$ and $(m+n)!$ both have the same number of terms.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to prove that for positive integers m and n, the product of their factorials, m!n!, is less than the factorial of their sum, (m+n)!. The user mentioned a hint about comparing terms in m! and (m+n)!.\n\nFirst, let's recall what factorials mean. m! is the product of numbers from 1 to m, and similarly for n!. The factorial (m+n)! is the product from 1 up to m+n. The hint says that 1 < m+1, 2 < m+2, ..., n < m+n. So if I expand both sides of the inequality m!n! < (m+n)!, maybe I can compare the terms.\n\nLet's write out m!n! as (1×2×...×m)(1×2×...×n). On the other hand, (m+n)! is 1×2×...×m×(m+1)×...×(m+n). Wait, but m! is part of (m+n)! if we consider the first m terms. However, the remaining terms from m+1 to m+n are all greater than the terms in n! if m and n are positive integers. For example, m+1 is greater than 1, m+2 greater than 2, ..., m+n greater than n. So if I take m! and multiply it by (m+1)(m+2)...(m+n), that's (m+n)!. But n! is 1×2×...×n, which is smaller than (m+1)(m+2)...(m+n) since each term in the latter is larger. Therefore, m!n! = m! × n! < m! × (m+1)(m+2)...(m+n) = (m+n)!.\n\nWait, but this only works if m and n are at least 1, right? Because if m or n were zero, the factorial would be 1, but the problem states they are positive integers. So the assumption is that m and n are positive integers. That makes sense. So each term in the product (m+1)(m+2)...(m+n) is strictly greater than the corresponding term in n!. Therefore, multiplying m! by a product of larger terms gives a larger result. Hence, m!n! < (m+n)!.\n\nBut maybe I should formalize this. Let's consider n terms: (m+1), (m+2), ..., (m+n). Each term (m+k) where k ranges from 1 to n. Compare this to the terms in n!: 1, 2, ..., n. Since m is a positive integer, m ≥ 1, so m + k ≥ 1 + k. But k starts at 1, so m + k ≥ k + 1 > k. Wait, actually, m + k is greater than k because m ≥ 1. So each term (m+k) in the product (m+1)...(m+n) is greater than the corresponding term k in n!.\n\nTherefore, the product (m+1)(m+2)...(m+n) = product_{k=1}^n (m + k) > product_{k=1}^n k = n!.\n\nMultiplying both sides by m! gives m!n! < m! × (m+1)...(m+n) = (m+n)!.\n\nSo the key assumptions are that m and n are positive integers. Each of these ensures that m + k > k for each k from 1 to n, which allows the product comparison. Therefore, the problem reduces to showing this inequality by term-wise comparison, using the fact that all terms in the second product are larger.",
