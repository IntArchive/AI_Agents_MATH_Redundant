    "Content": "I'm studying orientability of manifolds currently and I'm having trouble to prove the following: $M\\times N$ is orientable iff $M$ and $N$ are orientable. I am able to prove that the product is orientable if components are orientable (chart is $\\{(U_\\alpha\\times V_{\\beta},\\phi_\\alpha\\times \\psi_\\beta):(\\alpha,\\beta)\\in A\\times B \\}$, and $\\det J=\\det J_1 \\det J_2>0$ by Cauchy-Binet's theorem), but I don't know how to prove the other direction. So why this holds: if $M\\times N$ is orientable, then $M$ and $N$ are orientable? Thanks in advance.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If $M\\times N$ is orientable, any open submanifold is orientable. We can pick an open subset $U\\subset N$ diffeomorphic to $\\mathbb R^n$ , and $M\\times U\\equiv M\\times\\mathbb R^n$ is orientable. By induction it is enough to see that if $M\\times\\mathbb R$ is orientable, then $M$ is orientable. Pick any open cover $\\{W_i\\}$ of $M$ such that there are diffeomorphisms $\\varphi_i:\\mathbb R^m\\to W_i$ . The cover ${\\mathcal A}=\\{W_i\\times\\mathbb R\\}$ is an atlas with parametrizations $\\psi_i=\\varphi_i\\times Id:\\mathbb R^{m+1}\\to W_i\\times\\mathbb R$ . Then, if needed we can modify each $\\psi_i$ by changing the sign of the first variable in $\\mathbb R^{m+1}$ to make it compatible with a fixed orientation in $M\\times\\mathbb R$ . This changes correspondingly the $\\varphi_i$ . Thus ${\\mathcal A}$ is positive and we have $$\nJ(\\psi_j^{-1}\\circ\\psi_i)=\\begin{pmatrix}\nJ(\\varphi_j^{-1}\\circ\\varphi_i)&0\\\\0&1\n\\end{pmatrix},\n$$ hence $\\det J(\\varphi_j^{-1}\\circ\\varphi_i)=\\det J(\\psi_j^{-1}\\circ\\psi_i)>0$ . Thus\nthe $\\varphi_i$ 's are a positive atlas of $M$ . We are done.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user is asking to prove that the product of two manifolds M×N is orientable if and only if both M and N are orientable. They've already managed one direction: showing that if M and N are orientable, then their product is orientable. Now they need help with the converse: if M×N is orientable, then both M and N must be orientable.\n\nFirst, let me recall some definitions. A manifold is orientable if it has an atlas where all the transition maps have Jacobian determinants positive everywhere. Alternatively, an orientable manifold has a nowhere vanishing top-degree differential form (a volume form). The product manifold M×N has the product topology, and its charts are products of charts from M and N.\n\nThe user mentioned using the Cauchy-Binet theorem for the determinant of the product Jacobian. When you take charts (Uα×Vβ, φα×ψβ), the transition maps between product charts would have Jacobian matrices that are block diagonal, since the coordinates from M and N are independent. The determinant of such a matrix would be the product of the determinants of the individual Jacobians from M and N. So, if the product Jacobian determinant is positive, then both individual determinants must be positive. That seems to be how they proved that if M and N are orientable, then M×N is orientable.\n\nBut now the converse: if M×N is orientable, then M and N are orientable. Let's think. Suppose M×N is orientable. That means there exists an atlas on M×N where all transition maps have positive Jacobian determinants. But the charts on M×N are products of charts from M and N. So, for the product transition maps, the Jacobian determinant is the product of the Jacobian determinants from M's transition maps and N's transition maps. If the product is positive, then both determinants must be positive or both negative. However, since the atlas for M×N is oriented, we need that all transition maps for M×N have positive determinants, which would require that each individual transition map's Jacobian determinant (for M and for N) is positive. Wait, but maybe not? Because if both are negative, their product is positive. Hmm, so that might allow for some cases where individual determinants are negative, but their product is positive. But how does that affect orientability?\n\nWait, but orientability requires that there exists an atlas where all transition maps have positive determinants. So if M×N has such an atlas, then perhaps we can restrict to charts on M and N that ensure their determinants are positive. Let me think more carefully.\n\nSuppose we have an oriented atlas for M×N. Then, any transition map between product charts (Uα×Vβ) and (Uγ×Vδ) would have a Jacobian matrix which is block diagonal: the Jacobian of the transition map on M in the top-left block, the Jacobian of the transition map on N in the bottom-right block, and zeros elsewhere. The determinant of this matrix is the product of the determinants of the M and N parts. Since the atlas is oriented, this determinant is positive. Therefore, det(J_M) * det(J_N) > 0. \n\nBut how can we ensure that det(J_M) > 0 and det(J_N) > 0 for all transitions? Suppose, for contradiction, that M is not orientable. Then, there exists some loop in M where the transition maps have Jacobian determinants that change sign. Similarly for N. But if M×N is orientable, then along any such loop, the product of the determinants must remain positive. However, if M has a transition where det(J_M) changes sign, then to keep the product positive, det(J_N) must also change sign in a way that compensates. But N is a separate manifold; its transitions don't necessarily depend on M's transitions. So unless N's transitions are somehow tied to M's, this might not hold. Wait, but in the product manifold, the transition maps for M and N can be considered independently. So if we fix a chart on N, then transitions in M would require that det(J_M) * det(J_N) > 0. But if we fix the chart on N, then det(J_N) is fixed for transitions in M. Therefore, det(J_M) must be positive. Similarly, if we fix a chart on M, then det(J_N) must be positive. Therefore, both determinants must be positive individually. \n\nAlternatively, suppose that M is not orientable. Then there exists some pair of charts in M with transition map having negative determinant. If we take the product of these charts with a fixed chart in N, then the product transition map would have determinant det(J_M) * det(J_N). If the product is supposed to have positive determinant, then det(J_M) * det(J_N) > 0. But since det(J_M) is negative, det(J_N) must also be negative. But this would require that in N, the transition maps can also have negative determinants. However, if N is orientable, then we can choose an atlas for N where all det(J_N) are positive. But if N is not orientable, then there's no such atlas. Wait, this is getting a bit tangled.\n\nMaybe a better approach is to use the existence of a volume form. If M×N is orientable, then there exists a nowhere vanishing top-degree form on M×N. Let's denote this form by ω. We can then project this form onto M and N. For example, consider the projections π_M: M×N → M and π_N: M×N → N. If we can construct volume forms on M and N using ω, then M and N would be orientable. \n\nAlternatively, take a point (p,q) in M×N. The tangent space T_{(p,q)}(M×N) is isomorphic to T_pM ⊕ T_qN. A volume form on M×N would be a top-degree form that's non-degenerate. If we can restrict this volume form to T_pM and T_qN, we might get volume forms on each. But I'm not sure how exactly to do this. Maybe by fixing a point in N and considering the inclusion map i_p: M → M×N defined by i_p(q) = (q, p0) for some fixed p0 in N. Then the pullback of ω via i_p would give a form on M. Similarly for N. But we need to check that this pullback is non-vanishing. \n\nAlternatively, use the orientation on M×N to induce orientations on M and N. For each point p in M, the submanifold {p}×N is diffeomorphic to N. Since M×N is oriented, {p}×N inherits an orientation. Similarly, M×{q} inherits an orientation from M×N. But since all {p}×N are oriented and the orientation varies smoothly with p, this should induce an orientation on N. Similarly for M. \n\nWait, let me elaborate. If M×N is oriented, then each tangent space T_{(p,q)}(M×N) is oriented. For each fixed p, the submanifold {p}×N has tangent spaces isomorphic to T_qN. The orientation on M×N induces an orientation on T_qN by taking the orientation of T_{(p,q)}(M×N) and quotienting out the orientation of T_pM. Since the orientation of M×N is consistent, this should give a consistent orientation on N. Similarly for M. \n\nAlternatively, think in terms of local orientation. Suppose we have an orientation on M×N. Then for any point (p,q), we can choose a local oriented chart around (p,q). This chart can be written as U×V where U is a chart in M and V is a chart in N. The orientation on U×V induces orientations on U and V. If we can show that these induced orientations are consistent across overlaps, then M and N are orientable. \n\nSpecifically, suppose we have two overlapping charts U×V and U'×V' in M×N. The transition map between them has positive Jacobian determinant. As before, the Jacobian is block diagonal, so det(J_M) * det(J_N) > 0. If the transition maps for M×N are oriented, then whenever U and U' overlap in M, and V and V' overlap in N, the product transition has positive determinant. To ensure that M is orientable, we need that det(J_M) > 0 for all overlapping charts. Similarly for N. But how does det(J_M) * det(J_N) > 0 ensure that det(J_M) > 0 and det(J_N) > 0?\n\nSuppose we fix an atlas for M×N where all transition maps have positive Jacobian determinants. Then for any transition in M, keeping V fixed, the transition in N is trivial (identity), so det(J_N) = 1. Therefore, det(J_M) * 1 > 0 implies det(J_M) > 0. Similarly, fixing a chart in M, transitions in N must have det(J_N) > 0. Therefore, both M and N must have oriented atlases. \n\nAh, that makes sense! So if we take the oriented atlas for M×N, then by restricting to charts where one factor is fixed, we can derive oriented atlases for each factor. For example, fix a chart V in N. Then consider all charts U×V in M×N where V is fixed. The transition maps between such charts would involve only transitions in M, and the Jacobian determinant would just be det(J_M) * det(J_N). But since V is fixed, det(J_N) = 1 (because the transition map on N is the identity), so det(J_M) must be positive. Therefore, the collection of all such U forms an oriented atlas for M. Similarly for N by fixing a chart in M. \n\nTherefore, if M×N is orientable, then both M and N must be orientable. That's the core idea. The key is that by fixing a chart in one factor, the transitions in the other factor must have positive Jacobian determinants, hence giving an orientation.",
