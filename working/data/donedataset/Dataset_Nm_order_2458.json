    "Content": "Let $\\ell^2$ be the set of real number sequences $a=(a(i))_i$ such that $\\sum_i a(i)^2 <\\infty$ .

    "AcceptedAnswer": "Answer to the first part of your question easily follows from uniform boundedness principle . For each $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ we define linear operator (in fact linear functional)\n$$\nT_n:\\ell_2\\to\\mathbb{C}:y\\mapsto\\langle y, a_n\\rangle\n$$\nLet's compute their norm. From Cauchy Schwarz inequality it follows that for all $y\\in\\ell_2$ we have\n$$\n|T_n(y)|=|\\langle y,a_n\\rangle|\\leq\\Vert a_n\\Vert\\Vert y\\Vert\n$$\nhence \n$$\n\\Vert T_n\\Vert\\leq\\Vert a_n\\Vert\\tag{1}\n$$\nOn the other hand $\\Vert T_n(a_n)\\Vert=\\langle a_n,a_n\\rangle=\\Vert a_n\\Vert^2$, so \n$$\n\\Vert T_n\\Vert\\geq \\Vert T(a_n)\\Vert/\\Vert a_n\\Vert=\\Vert a_n\\Vert\\tag{2}\n$$\nFrom $(1)$ and $(2)$ it follows that \n$$\n\\Vert T_n\\Vert=\\Vert a_n\\Vert\\tag{3}\n$$\nNow fix $y\\in \\ell_2$, then by assumption $\\lim\\limits_{n\\to\\infty} T_n(y)=\\lim\\limits_{n\\to\\infty}\\langle y,a_n\\rangle=\\langle a,y\\rangle$. This means that the sequnce $\\{T_n(y):n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\}$ is convergent and, as the consequence is bounded. Thus for each $y\\in\\ell_2$ we have\n$$\n\\sup\\{| T_n(y)|:n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\}<+\\infty\n$$\nThen from uniform boundedness principle it follows that \n$$\n\\sup\\{\\Vert T_n\\Vert:n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\}<+\\infty\n$$\nUsing $(3)$ we conclude that $\\{\\Vert a_n\\Vert:n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\}$ is bounded. In fact there is more general and much more short proof, but it involves additional usage of standard embedding into the double dual which is isometric for normed spaces. As for the second part of the question. It is much more easier. Fix $i\\in\\mathbb{N}$ and consider vector $y_i\\in\\ell_2$ such that\n$$\ny_i(k)=\\begin{cases}1&\\quad\\text{ if }\\quad k=i\\\\0&\\quad\\text{ if }\\quad k\\neq i\\end{cases}\n$$\nObviously\n$$\n\\langle y_i,a_n\\rangle=\\sum\\limits_{k=1}^\\infty a_n(k)\\overline{y_i(k)}=a_n(i)\\\\\n\\langle y_i,a\\rangle=\\sum\\limits_{k=1}^\\infty a(k)\\overline{y_i(k)}=a(i)\n$$\nSince for all $y\\in\\ell_2$ we have $\\lim\\limits_{n\\to\\infty}\\langle y,a_n\\rangle=\\langle y,a\\rangle$ then\n$$\n\\lim\\limits_{n\\to\\infty} a_n(i)=\\lim\\limits_{n\\to\\infty}\\langle y_i,a_n\\rangle=\\langle y_i,a\\rangle=a(i)\n$$\nThis s exactly what we wanted to prove. P.S. There is NO absolutely elementary proof for your question without appealing to any theorem. Want you or not, you MUST use completeness of $\\ell_2$. For incomplete inner product spaces the first result doesn't hold. For counterexample see answer to the question What facts about the weak topology fail in spaces that aren't Banach? . Well, one can modify my proof so it won't use uniform boundedness principle, but this modification will significantly enlarge the proof and in fact one WILL prove uniform boundedness principle for this particular case, but without explicitly giving things their names.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let me tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's being asked. The problem is about weak convergence in the space ℓ². So, we have a sequence {a_n} in ℓ² that converges weakly to some a in ℓ². The task is to show two things: first, that the norms of the a_n are bounded, and second, that each component of a_n converges to the corresponding component of a.\n\nStarting with the first part: proving boundedness of the norms. I remember from functional analysis that one of the consequences of the Banach-Steinhaus theorem (or the Uniform Boundedness Principle) is that weakly convergent sequences are norm bounded. But since the problem is in ℓ², which is a Hilbert space, maybe there's a more direct approach. In Hilbert spaces, weak convergence implies that for every y in ℓ², the inner product ⟨a_n, y⟩ converges to ⟨a, y⟩. \n\nIf I can apply the Uniform Boundedness Principle here, it would state that if a family of linear operators (in this case, the functionals induced by a_n) is pointwise bounded, then it's uniformly bounded. Since each a_n can be associated with a linear functional via the inner product, and since these functionals converge pointwise (to the functional induced by a), they should be bounded. The UBP then gives that the norms of a_n are bounded. So that's probably the way to go for the first part.\n\nFor the second part: componentwise convergence. Each component a_n(i) can be related to the inner product with the standard basis vectors e_i, where e_i has 1 in the i-th position and 0 elsewhere. Since e_i is in ℓ² (because its norm is 1), weak convergence implies that ⟨a_n, e_i⟩ converges to ⟨a, e_i⟩. But ⟨a_n, e_i⟩ is exactly a_n(i), and ⟨a, e_i⟩ is a(i). Therefore, componentwise convergence follows directly from weak convergence when taking y as the standard basis vectors.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that the standard basis vectors e_i are indeed in ℓ². Since each e_i has norm 1, they are in ℓ². So that part checks out.\n\nSo putting it all together: the boundedness of the norms comes from the Uniform Boundedness Principle applied to the weakly convergent sequence, and the componentwise convergence comes from testing the weak convergence against the standard basis vectors.",
