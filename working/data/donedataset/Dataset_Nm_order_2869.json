    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about proving that the function f(x) is continuous using an epsilon-delta proof. The function is defined piecewise: it's x*sin(1/x) when x is not zero, and 0 when x is zero. The user mentions they've already shown continuity at x=0, so now they need to do it for x not equal to zero. \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. Let me parse the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe function f is defined as a piecewise function. So one assumption is that f(x) is defined as x*sin(1/x) when x is not zero. Another assumption is that f(0) is defined as 0. But the problem is about proving continuity for x ≠ 0, so maybe the fact that they already handled x=0 isn't part of the assumptions here. Wait, the problem says \"How can I show it for x ≠ 0, also using an epsilon-delta proof?\" So the problem is about continuity at points other than zero. \n\nAssumptions would include the definition of f for x ≠ 0, and that the user wants an epsilon-delta proof. But do I need to list that the user has already shown continuity at 0? Probably not, because the current problem is about x ≠ 0. So the key assumptions here are:\n\n1. f(x) is defined as x*sin(1/x) for x ≠ 0.\n2. The problem requires proving continuity at any x ≠ 0 using an epsilon-delta proof.\n\nWait, but in the example given, the assumptions included both the variable's properties and any given conditions. So in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, no, looking back, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that example might be incorrect. Wait, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption says n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that's not matching. Wait, maybe the example was modified. Hmm, perhaps in the example, the user made a mistake. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the example is not accurate. But regardless, I need to focus on the current problem.\n\nSo, in the current problem, the key points are:\n\n- The function is defined as x*sin(1/x) for x ≠ 0.\n- The task is to prove continuity at points x ≠ 0 using epsilon-delta.\n\nBut continuity is generally proven at a point. So the problem is to show that for any x ≠ 0, f is continuous at that x. Therefore, the assumptions should include that x is a real number not equal to zero, and f is defined as x*sin(1/x) there. Also, the approach must use epsilon-delta.\n\nSo breaking down the assumptions:\n\n1. f(x) = x·sin(1/x) for x ≠ 0.\n2. The proof must use the ε-δ definition of continuity.\n3. The continuity is to be proven at a point x ≠ 0.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions listed properties applied to one object each. For the current problem, the function f is defined in a certain way for x ≠ 0, and the task is to prove continuity at those points using ε-δ. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- f(x) = x·sin(1/x) when x ≠ 0.\n- x is a real number and x ≠ 0.\n- The proof must use the ε-δ method.\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't explicitly say \"x is a real number\", but since it's a calculus problem, we can assume x is real. However, in the example, the assumption was \"n is an integer\", so perhaps here we should include \"x is a real number\" as an assumption. But the original problem didn't state that; it's implicit. But according to the example, maybe we need to list all assumptions, even if they are implicit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem's assumption is just about the definition of f and the method to use. Let me see.\n\nThe user says: \"I'm doing an exercise that asks me to prove that f is continuous using a ε-δ proof. I have that [definition of f]. I've already managed to show this property for x=0. How can I show it for x ≠ 0, also using a ε-δ proof?\"\n\nSo the problem is to show continuity at any x ≠ 0 via ε-δ. Therefore, the function is defined as x·sin(1/x) for x ≠ 0, and we have to prove continuity at those points. The assumptions needed are:\n\n- f is defined as x·sin(1/x) for x ≠ 0.\n- The proof must use the ε-δ definition.\n- The point of continuity is x ≠ 0.\n\nBut how to phrase each assumption as a single line. The example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Each on separate lines.\n\nSo for this problem:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) = x·sin(1/x) for x ≠ 0,\nx is a real number not equal to 0,\nthe proof must use the ε-δ definition of continuity.\n\nProblem: Prove that f is continuous at x ≠ 0 using an ε-δ proof.\n\nWait, but the problem statement's title is \"ε-δ proof that f(x) = x sin(1/x), x ≠ 0, is continuous\". So the problem is to prove that f is continuous (everywhere, but since they handled x=0, now x≠0). But continuity at each point. So perhaps the problem is to prove that f is continuous at every x ≠ 0, using ε-δ.\n\nTherefore, the structured problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) is defined as x·sin(1/x) for x ≠ 0,\nx is a real number,\nx ≠ 0,\nthe proof must use the ε-δ method.\n\nProblem: Prove that f is continuous at x ≠ 0.\n\nBut in the example, the problem part restates the main goal. Let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem assumes n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Because 91 is 7*13, so maybe the original problem had a typo or the example was incorrect. Anyway, perhaps the example is not to be followed exactly, but the structure is to list all assumptions and then the problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the user already handled x=0, and needs to do x≠0. But the problem is to prove continuity at those points. The assumptions would be the definition of f at x≠0, that x≠0, and that the proof method is ε-δ.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) = x·sin(1/x) for x ≠ 0,\nx is a real number,\nx ≠ 0,\ncontinuity must be proven using the ε-δ definition.\n\nProblem: Prove that f is continuous at x.\n\nAlternatively, the problem statement could be \"Prove that f is continuous at x ≠ 0 using an ε-δ proof.\"\n\nBut in the example, the problem part was phrased as \"Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" So perhaps here, it's \"Prove that f is continuous at x ≠ 0 using an ε-δ proof.\"\n\nBut the user's original question says \"How can I show it for x ≠ 0, also using a ε-δ proof?\" So the problem is to show continuity at x≠0 via ε-δ.\n\nTherefore, structured as:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) is defined as x·sin(1/x) when x ≠ 0,\nx is a real number and x ≠ 0,\nthe proof must use the ε-δ method.\n\nProblem: Prove that f is continuous at x.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to prove continuity at all x ≠ 0, but since in the ε-δ proof, you prove it at a general point x ≠ 0.\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n- For x ≠ 0, f(x) = x·sin(1/x).\n- x is a real number not equal to 0.\n- The proof must use ε-δ.\n\nProblem: Prove that f is continuous at x.\n\nBut maybe the problem statement should be \"Prove that f is continuous at any x ≠ 0 using an ε-δ proof.\"\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be phrased as in the original title: \"ε-δ proof that f(x) = x sin(1/x), x ≠ 0, is continuous.\"\n\nSo, following the example's structure, where the problem part is the main goal, and the assumptions list the conditions.\n\nThus, the answer should be:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) = x·sin(1/x) for x ≠ 0,\nx is a real number,\nx ≠ 0,\nthe proof must use the ε-δ definition.\n\nProblem: Prove that f is continuous at x ≠ 0.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions list the properties applied to one object each. So each line is a separate assumption. For instance:\n\nAssumption:\n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by 7.\n\nIn the current case, the assumptions would be:\n\n- f(x) = x·sin(1/x) when x ≠ 0.\n- x is a real number.\n- x ≠ 0.\n- The proof uses the ε-δ method.\n\nBut maybe the proof using ε-δ is part of the problem, not an assumption. Wait, in the example, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\", which was part of the problem's condition. However, in the original problem, the user is told to use ε-δ, so that's a requirement of the problem, not an assumption about the function or variables. So perhaps \"the proof must use ε-δ\" is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Hmm.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like a mistake, because the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem adds that n is divisible by 7. That would change the problem. So maybe the example has an error, or perhaps the user intended to modify the problem. Assuming that's a correct example, then perhaps the assumptions include both the given conditions and any additional constraints.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user is required to use an ε-δ proof. That's a requirement of the problem, not an assumption about the function. So perhaps it's part of the problem statement, not the assumptions. In the example, the assumptions were properties of the variables, not the method. So in the example, the problem was to prove for every integer n, and the formatted problem's assumption included n is an integer (which is given) and n is divisible by 7 (which seems like an added constraint, which might be a mistake).\n\nBut given that, maybe in the current problem, the assumptions are only about the function's definition and the domain of x. The requirement to use ε-δ is part of the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) = x·sin(1/x) for x ≠ 0,\nx is a real number,\nx ≠ 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that f is continuous at x using an ε-δ proof.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is \"Prove that f is continuous at x ≠ 0 using an ε-δ proof.\"\n\nBut in the example, the problem part was the original goal. The user had to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the assumptions included n being integer and divisible by 7, which seems conflicting. So perhaps in the example, there's a mistake, but we have to follow the structure.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the assumptions list all conditions on the variables and function definitions, and the problem is the main goal.\n\nTherefore, for the current problem:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) = x·sin(1/x) for x ≠ 0,\nx is a real number,\nx ≠ 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that f is continuous at x using an ε-δ proof.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be phrased as \"Prove that f is continuous at x ≠ 0 using an ε-δ proof,\" but since continuity is proven at a point, it's better to say \"at x\" where x ≠ 0 is an assumption.\n\nYes, so the assumptions include that x is not zero, and the problem is to prove continuity at x.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) = x·sin(1/x) when x ≠ 0,\nx is a real number,\nx ≠ 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that f is continuous at x using an ε-δ proof.\n\nThat seems to align with the example's structure, where assumptions list the conditions on the variables and function, and the problem states what needs to be proven.",
