    "Content": "How one can prove that the infinite sum of this function equals its integral\n$$\n\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^\\infty\\frac{\\cos\\pi\\sqrt{n^2+1}}{3+4n^2}=\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty\\frac{\\cos\\pi\\sqrt{x^2+1}}{3+4x^2}dx\\ ? \\tag{1}\n$$ My analysis: Mathematica wasn't able to return any closed form for the integral or the sum. Then I checked this relation by numerical computations and it agreed to about 20 decimal places. I know from this question Sum equals integral that the function $\\text{sinc}\\ x=\\frac{\\sin x}{x}$ has the same property\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} {\\rm sinc}\\, x \\, dx = \\sum_{n = -\\infty}^{+\\infty} {\\rm sinc}\\, n = \\pi\n$$\nI tried to find a closed form for the integral $(1)$ but couldn't. Motivation: I was challenged by a friend to prove this relation. I'm curious how one can prove it? Note: There has been a suggestion to straightforwardly apply Euler-MacLauren summation formula to prove this statement. Though I don't know why it can not be applied in this case, I checked numerically whether the sum equals the integral for the similar looking functions $f_1(x)=\\frac{\\cos\\pi\\sqrt{x^2+1}}{1+x^2}$ and $f_2(x)=\\frac{\\cos\\pi\\sqrt{x^2+1}}{2+x^2}$, but in both cases there was a difference of about 1% between the sum and the integral. In starck contrast to this, using the same algorithm for $\\frac{\\cos\\pi\\sqrt{x^2+1}}{3+4x^2}$ there wasn't any difference between the sum and the integral at least to 20 decimal places. So I think it is very unlikely that 1% error can be attributed to computational error.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "For any positive $a$, define $$f_a(x) =\\frac{\\cos\\pi\\sqrt{x^2+1}}{x^2+a^2}$$ What you have observed is caused by the equality\n$$\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^\\infty f_a(n) - \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f_a(x) dx =\n\\frac{2\\pi}{a(e^{2\\pi a} - 1)}\\times\n\\begin{cases}\n\\cosh\\pi\\sqrt{a^2-1}, & a > 1\\\\\n\\\\\n\\cos\\pi\\sqrt{1-a^2},  & a < 1\n\\end{cases}\n\\tag{*1}\n$$\nand the fact $$\\cos\\pi\\sqrt{1-a^2} = \\cos\\frac{\\pi}{2} = 0\\quad\\text{ when } a^2 = \\frac34$$ To see why $(*1)$ is true, we use the fact $f_a(n)$ is an even function in $n$ to rewrite LHS of $(*1)$ as $$2 \\left[\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty f_a(n) - \\left(\\int_0^\\infty f_a(x) dx + \\frac12 f_a(0)\\right)\\right]$$ This is similar to what you will find in\nthe Abel-Plana formula ${}^{\\color{blue}{[1]}}$, For any function $f(z)$ which is continuous on $\\Re z \\ge 0$ and analytic on $\\Re z > 0$ $f(z) \\sim o(e^{2\\pi|\\Im z|} )$ as $\\Im z \\to \\pm \\infty$, uniformly with respect to $\\Re z$. $f(z) \\sim O(e^{2\\pi|\\Im z|}/|z|^{1+\\epsilon})$ as $\\Re z \\to +\\infty$ ${}^{\\color{blue}{[2]}}$. we have $$\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty f(n) = \\int_0^\\infty f(x) dx + \\frac12 f(0) + i \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{f(it) - f(-it)}{e^{2\\pi t}-1} dt\\tag{*2}$$ However, $f_a(x)$ doesn't exactly satisfy the condition above. It has two\npoles at $\\pm a i$. After a little bit of tweaking of the contour used in the proof of the Abel-Plana formula, one find: $$\\text{LHS}(*1) = 2i \\lim_{\\epsilon\\to 0^{+}} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{f_a(it+\\epsilon) - f_a(-it+\\epsilon)}{e^{2\\pi t} - 1} dt$$ For $t \\ne a$, since $f_a(z)$ is even, the two pieces in $f_a(it+\\epsilon) - f_a(-it+\\epsilon)$ cancels out as $\\epsilon \\to 0^{+}$. For $t \\approx a$, the two pieces can be combined to a integral of $\\frac{f(it)}{e^{2\\pi t}-1}$ over a circle centered at $a$. As a result, RHS reduces to $$(2i)(2\\pi i)\\text{Res}_{t = a}\\left[\\frac{\\cos\\pi\\sqrt{1-t^2}}{(a^2 - t^2)(e^{2\\pi t} - 1)}\\right]\n= \\frac{2\\pi}{a(e^{2\\pi a}-1)}\\times\\begin{cases}\n\\cosh\\pi\\sqrt{a^2-1}, & a > 1\\\\\n\\\\\n\\cos\\pi\\sqrt{1-a^2}, & a < 1\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nBack to the special case $a^2 = \\frac{3}{4}$ which corresponds to the equality in question. When $a^2 = \\frac{3}{4}$, the \"pole\" of $f_a(z)$ at $z = \\pm a i$ become removable singularities. The original version of Abel-Plana formula in $(*2)$ applies. Since $f_a(x)$ is even, last integral in $(*2)$ vanishes and the equality follows. This explain why the sum equal to the integral for  $\\frac{\\cos\\pi\\sqrt{x^2+1}}{3+4x^2}$ but not other similar looking integrand like $\\frac{\\cos\\pi\\sqrt{x^2+1}}{1+x^2}$ or $\\frac{\\cos\\pi\\sqrt{x^2+1}}{2+x^2}$. Notes $\\color{blue}{[1]}$ For more details of Abel-Plana formula and its derivation, please refer to $\\S 8.3$ of Frank W. J Olver's book: Asymptotics and Special Functions . $\\color{blue}{[2]}$ In order to convert the AP formula on finite sum in Olver's book to infinite sum here, I have added a condition $(3)$ for this particular problem. The whole purpose of that is to force following limits to zero.\n$$\\lim\\limits_{b\\to\\infty} f(b) = 0\\quad\\text{ and }\\quad\\lim\\limits_{b\\to\\infty}\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{f(b+it)-f(b-it)}{e^{2\\pi t} - 1}dt = 0$$\nFor other $f(z)$, if one can justifies these limits, we can forget condition $(3)$ and the AP formula remains valid.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure with Assumptions and Problem. Let me first read through the original question carefully.\n\nThe original problem is to prove that the infinite sum of the function (cos(π√(n²+1)))/(3+4n²) from n=-∞ to ∞ equals its integral over the same range. The user mentions numerical verification and references a similar case with sinc functions. They also note that applying Euler-Maclaurin might not work here, as other similar functions showed discrepancies, but in this specific case, the sum and integral agree closely.\n\nNow, the task is to extract the assumptions and state the problem. The example given had assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the key points are:\n\n1. The sum is over all integers n.\n2. The integral is over all real numbers x.\n3. The function involved is f(x) = cos(π√(x²+1))/(3+4x²).\n4. The problem is to prove equality between the sum and the integral.\n\nLooking for assumptions: The problem statement doesn't explicitly state conditions like convergence or specific properties of the function, but in such analysis problems, common implicit assumptions might include that the function is integrable over the real line and that the series converges. However, since the user didn't mention these, maybe they are considered part of the problem to verify. But according to the example, assumptions are specific to the problem's given conditions. The original question doesn't list any explicit constraints beyond the sum and integral over integers and reals, respectively. So perhaps there are no additional assumptions here beyond the structure of the sum and integral. Wait, the example included assumptions from the problem even if they weren't explicit. Wait, the original problem in the example had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, no. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted problem's assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like a mistake. Wait, looking back: the original example's problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem lists assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but that's conflicting. The original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which might be incorrect. Hmm, maybe that example was a mistake. But perhaps in that example, the user intended to filter the problem, perhaps the original problem had an error? Or maybe the example is wrong. Anyway, perhaps I should focus on the current problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the user is asking to prove the equality between the sum and the integral for this specific function. The problem as stated doesn't mention any restrictions on n or x, other than they run from -infty to +infty. So maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond the sum over integers and integral over reals. But perhaps the function's properties are such that the equality holds, which might require certain conditions like the function being Schwartz class, or satisfying Poisson summation formula conditions. But since the user hasn't specified those, maybe the assumptions are just the structure of the sum and integral. Wait, the example's original problem didn't have the assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the formatted problem included it. Wait, that suggests maybe the example was incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the example was a different problem where the original problem had a mistake, and the formatted corrected it. Hmm, this is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the original example had a typo, and the formatted problem corrected it. For example, maybe the original problem said \"for every integer n divisible by 7\" but the user wrote the formatted problem as including that assumption. But given the current problem, the user's example might not be a good guide. Therefore, perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions should list that n is an integer, and x is a real number, and that the sum is over all integers n, and the integral is over all real x. However, the problem statement itself already states the sum and integral, so perhaps there are no additional assumptions. The example's assumptions included \"n is an integer\" even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", so perhaps the assumption is redundant. Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires certain properties of the function. Wait, the problem's note mentions that other functions (f1 and f2) don't satisfy the equality, so maybe there's a specific property in the denominator 3+4x² that allows this. But the user hasn't stated that as an assumption. The task is to filter unrelated information and structure the problem. The original problem's question is about proving the sum equals the integral for this specific function. The user's analysis mentions numerical verification and references the sinc function case. The problem statement is as written. So perhaps the assumptions are implicit in the problem's structure: sum over integers, integral over reals, and the function is defined as given. Since the example included the assumption that n is an integer (from the original problem's \"for every integer n\"), perhaps in this problem, the assumption is that n ranges over all integers, and x ranges over all real numbers. However, the problem statement already includes those in the sum and integral limits. Maybe the example's assumption was redundant. So for the current problem, perhaps there are no explicit assumptions beyond the problem statement. But the format requires listing assumptions. Alternatively, maybe the function is even, given the sum from -infty to infty, so maybe assuming symmetry? But the problem statement doesn't specify that. Alternatively, perhaps the function is such that the Poisson summation formula applies, leading to the sum equaling the integral. But again, the user hasn't stated that. Therefore, maybe the only assumption is the structure of the problem: sum over integers equals integral over reals for this specific function. But the example had an assumption line, even if redundant. So in the current problem, perhaps the assumption is that the sum is taken over all integers n, and the integral is over all real numbers x, and the function is as defined. But the problem statement already includes that. Hmm, perhaps in this case, there are no additional assumptions beyond what's in the problem statement, so the assumptions section is empty. But the example included assumptions even if they were part of the problem's original statement. For instance, the example's original problem said \"for every integer n\", and the formatted problem's assumption listed \"n is an integer\". So following that, in this problem, the assumptions would include:\n\n- n is an integer.\n- x is a real number.\n\nBut since the problem statement already mentions the sum over integers and integral over real numbers, perhaps these are the assumptions. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes convergence of the sum and integral. But the example didn't list convergence as an assumption. So perhaps the answer should have:\n\nAssumption:\nThe sum is taken over all integers n,\nThe integral is taken over all real numbers x,\nThe function is defined as f(n) = cos(π√(n² + 1))/(3 + 4n²),\nThe function is defined as f(x) = cos(π√(x² + 1))/(3 + 4x²).\n\nBut wait, the function is the same for both sum and integral. Alternatively, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nx is a real number.\n\nBut again, these are part of the problem's setup. The example's format required listing all assumptions line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. In the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", so the assumption was \"n is an integer\". Additionally, the problem might have other conditions; in the example, the formatted problem included \"n is divisible by 7\", but I think that might have been a mistake. Wait, the example's original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem's assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like an error. Unless the original example had a typo. Perhaps the user intended that, but in any case, perhaps for the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nx is a real number.\n\nBut since the problem already states the sum over n from -infty to infty (which implies n is integer) and integral over x from -infty to infty (real x), maybe these are redundant. However, following the example, even if the problem states \"for every integer n\", the assumption lists \"n is an integer\". Therefore, in this case, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nx is a real number.\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't restrict n or x further. The function is given, so maybe another assumption is that the function f(n) and f(x) are as defined. But that's part of the problem. Alternatively, the problem might have an implicit assumption that the sum and integral converge, but the user hasn't stated that. Given the example, I think the intended assumptions here are that n is an integer and x is a real number. Thus, the formatted problem would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nn is an integer,\nx is a real number.\nProblem: \nProve that \n$$\n\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^\\infty\\frac{\\cos\\pi\\sqrt{n^2+1}}{3+4n^2}=\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty\\frac{\\cos\\pi\\sqrt{x^2+1}}{3+4x^2}dx.\n$$\n###\n\nWait, but the problem as stated in the original already includes the sum over integers and integral over reals. However, the example included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption even though it was part of the problem's original statement. So following that pattern, the assumptions here would include n being integer and x being real. Therefore, this should be correct.",
