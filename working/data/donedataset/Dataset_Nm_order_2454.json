    "Content": "Assuming that $\\gcd(a,b) = 1$, prove that $\\gcd(a+b,a^2+b^2) = 1$ or $2$. I tried this problem and ended up with $$d\\mid 2a^2,\\quad d\\mid 2b^2$$\nwhere $d = \\gcd(a+b,a^2+b^2)$, but then I am stuck; by these two conclusions how can I conclude $d=1$ or $2$? \nAnd also is there any other way of proving this result?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "From what you have found, you can conclude easily. If $d$ divides two numbers, it also divides their gcd, so $$d| \\gcd (2a^2,2b^2) = 2 \\gcd (a,b) ^2 =2.$$ So, $d$ is a divisor of 2 and thus either 1 or 2.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. Let me read through the question carefully. The user is asking to prove that the gcd of (a+b) and (a² + b²) is either 1 or 2, given that gcd(a, b) = 1. They also mentioned trying the problem and getting to a point where they have d divides 2a² and d divides 2b², where d is the gcd in question. They're stuck there and also asking for alternative proofs.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The main assumption given is that gcd(a, b) = 1. But wait, the problem states \"if gcd(a, b) = 1\", so that's the primary assumption. The problem then is to prove that gcd(a + b, a² + b²) is either 1 or 2. \n\nNow, the user also mentions their attempt where they set d = gcd(a + b, a² + b²) and deduced that d divides 2a² and d divides 2b². From that, since d divides both 2a² and 2b², then d should divide gcd(2a², 2b²). But since gcd(a, b) = 1, gcd(a², b²) = 1, so gcd(2a², 2b²) = 2. Therefore, d divides 2, which means d is either 1 or 2. That seems like a valid conclusion, but the user is stuck here. Maybe they didn't realize that step. But in the problem statement, we don't need to include the user's attempt, just the problem itself.\n\nSo, the assumptions should be: gcd(a, b) = 1. But wait, are there other implicit assumptions? The problem is about integers a and b, right? So maybe we need to state that a and b are integers. But in the original problem, the user just says \"assuming that gcd(a, b) = 1\", which usually implies a and b are integers. But to be thorough, should we include that a and b are integers? Because gcd is defined for integers. \n\nIn the example provided, the assumption was that \"n is an integer\", so following that example, we should list that a and b are integers. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- a and b are integers.\n- gcd(a, b) = 1.\n\nEach of these is a separate line, addressing one condition. The first line establishes that a and b are integers, the second gives the gcd condition.\n\nThe problem then is to prove that gcd(a + b, a² + b²) is 1 or 2. \n\nWait, the original problem title says \"Prove gcd(a+b, a² + b²) is 1 or 2 if gcd(a,b) = 1\". So the problem is exactly that. Therefore, the formatted problem should have those two assumptions and then the problem statement.\n\nLet me check the example again. The original problem in the example was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, with the assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the user's example, the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7, but the formatted problem included that as an assumption. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, let me check:\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n + 2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, but the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the user made an error in the example? Because 91 is 7*13, so perhaps the problem is that 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n + 2^n) is divisible by 91 when n is divisible by 6 or something? Wait, maybe the original problem was different. But according to the example given by the user, the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. That seems incorrect. So perhaps the user made a mistake in their example. \n\nBut in any case, according to the user's instructions, I need to follow the example they provided. So in their example, they took the original problem which says \"for every integer n\" and then in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is an integer (redundant, since the problem says \"for every integer n\") and n is divisible by 7. So maybe they intended to include the divisibility by 7 as an assumption even though the original problem didn't state it? That might be a mistake, but perhaps the user intended that in their example. So perhaps they're asking me to parse the problem and extract the necessary assumptions, even if they're not explicitly stated? Wait, but that would be incorrect. For example, in the original problem, the user wrote \"Assuming that gcd(a, b) = 1, prove...\", so that's an explicit assumption. The problem may also implicitly assume that a and b are integers, which is standard for gcd problems, but maybe should be stated.\n\nSo applying that logic to the current problem: The original problem states \"Assuming that gcd(a, b) = 1, prove that gcd(a+b, a² + b²) is 1 or 2\". Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. a and b are integers.\n2. gcd(a, b) = 1.\n\nEach on separate lines. Then the problem is to prove that gcd(a + b, a² + b²) is 1 or 2.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have those two assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe user's attempt in their question mentions deducing that d divides 2a² and 2b², but that's part of their solution attempt, not part of the problem statement. Therefore, we don't include that in the assumptions or the problem.\n\nHence, the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption:\na and b are integers,\ngcd(a, b) = 1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that gcd(a + b, a² + b²) is 1 or 2.\n\nI think that's accurate. The user's example included redundant assumptions (like n is integer when the problem already stated \"for every integer n\"), but perhaps following their structure, we need to list all assumptions explicitly. Since in the original problem here, it's only stated that gcd(a, b) = 1, but a and b being integers is implicit. However, in the example, even though the problem stated \"for every integer n\", they still listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. Therefore, to follow the example, we should include \"a and b are integers\" as an assumption, even if it's implied. So that's two separate assumptions: one about a and b being integers, another about their gcd being 1.\n\nSo the formatted problem is as above.",
