    "Content": "Let $ABCD$ be the regular tetrahedron, and $M, N$ points in space. Prove that: $$AM \\cdot AN + BM \\cdot BN + CM \\cdot CN \\geq DM \\cdot DN$$ Maybe use Ptolemy's inequality solve it?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Yes this is just Ptolemy's inequality. Suppose that the isometry (i.e. rotation/reflection) swapping $(A,B)$ and $(C,D)$ sends $M$ to $L$. Now it suffices to show that $$BL\\cdot AN+AL\\cdot BN+DL\\cdot CN\\geq CL\\cdot DN.$$ Ptolemy's inequality gives the following: $$\\begin{align*}BL\\cdot AN+AL\\cdot BN&\\geq LN\\cdot AB\\\\LN\\cdot CD+DL\\cdot CN&\\geq CL\\cdot DN.\\end{align*}$$ Since $AB=CD$, adding the two gives the desired inequality.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to format this problem as per the user's instructions. First, I need to read the original question carefully. The problem is about a regular tetrahedron ABCD, and points M and N in space. The inequality to prove is AM·AN + BM·BN + CM·CN ≥ DM·DN. The user also mentions maybe using Ptolemy's inequality.\n\nSo, the task is to structure this into the specified format. Let's start with the assumptions. The original problem states that ABCD is a regular tetrahedron. That's one assumption. Then, M and N are points in space. Since they are just points in space without any specific conditions, I need to check if there are any implicit assumptions. The problem doesn't mention any restrictions on M and N, like being in a certain plane or having specific distances. So the assumptions would be:\n\n1. ABCD is a regular tetrahedron.\n2. M is a point in space.\n3. N is a point in space.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"points in space\" for both M and N. So each should be a separate assumption. The example given in the user's question had each assumption on a separate line, each addressing one property for one object. So yes, three assumptions here: ABCD is regular tetrahedron, M is a point in space, N is a point in space.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that inequality. The user suggested using Ptolemy's inequality, but that's part of the original question's text, not an assumption. So the problem statement is the inequality as given.\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem had an extra condition that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the assumptions. But in this case, the problem as stated doesn't have any conditions on M and N other than being points in space. So no need to add any other assumptions unless there's something implicit. For example, if the problem required M and N to be on the edges or something, but here it's just \"points in space.\"\n\nSo the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumptions:\n- ABCD is a regular tetrahedron.\n- M is a point in space.\n- N is a point in space.\n\nProblem: Prove that AM·AN + BM·BN + CM·CN ≥ DM·DN.\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem mentioned \"for every integer n,\" but the user structured it with an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, no, the example given had the original problem stating \"for every integer n\" but in the formatted problem, the assumptions were n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal problem in the example: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, but the original problem said \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Because in the original problem, the conclusion is supposed to hold for every integer n, but the user's formatted version restricts n to being divisible by 7. That might be an error. Maybe the example was incorrect, but the user provided it as an example. So perhaps the user's example has a mistake, but we have to follow their format.\n\nWait, but in the current problem, the original problem does not state any restrictions on M and N other than being points in space. So the assumptions would be ABCD is regular, M and N are points in space. So three assumptions. The problem is the inequality.\n\nI think that's correct. The user's example might have been incorrectly structured, but we need to follow their instruction. So the answer should list all the assumptions as separate lines, each for one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo yes, in this case, ABCD is a regular tetrahedron, M is a point in space, N is a point in space. Then the problem is to prove the inequality.",
