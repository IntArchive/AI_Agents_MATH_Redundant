    "Content": "I' m trying to prove that $$A=\\begin{pmatrix}\n 4 & 2 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n 2 & 5 & 2 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n 0 & 2 & 5 & 2 & 0 \\\\\n 0 & 0 & 2 & 5 & 2 \\\\\n 0 & 0 & 0 & 2 & 5 \\\\  \n \\end{pmatrix}$$ admits a Cholesky decomposition . $A$ is symmetric, so it admits a Cholesky decomposition iff it is positive definite . The only methods I know for checking this are: $X^tAX > 0, \\quad \\forall X \\in \\mathbb{K}^n- \\{0\\}$. If $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $A$, then $\\lambda>0.$ I have failed to prove it using 1 and 2 is taking me so much time. Is there any easier way to do this, given that $A$ is tridiagonal ?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants to prove that the given symmetric tridiagonal matrix A is positive definite so that it admits a Cholesky decomposition. They mentioned that since A is symmetric, Cholesky is possible if and only if it's positive definite. They tried using the definition with the quadratic form and checking eigenvalues but found it time-consuming. They're asking if there's a faster method specific to tridiagonal matrices.\n\nFirst, I remember that for a matrix to be positive definite, all its leading principal minors (the determinants of the top-left k x k submatrices) must be positive. Maybe that's a route. Let's check if that's feasible for a tridiagonal matrix.\n\nThe matrix given is:\n\n4 2 0 0 0  \n2 5 2 0 0  \n0 2 5 2 0  \n0 0 2 5 2  \n0 0 0 2 5  \n\nIt's symmetric and tridiagonal. For positive definiteness, another property is that if a symmetric matrix is diagonally dominant and has positive diagonal entries, then it's positive definite. Let me check diagonal dominance here.\n\nDiagonal dominance means that for each row, the absolute value of the diagonal entry is greater than or equal to the sum of the absolute values of the other entries. Since all off-diagonal entries are non-negative here, we can check directly.\n\nFirst row: 4 vs. 2. 4 > 2, so yes. Second row: 5 vs. 2 + 2 = 4. 5 > 4. Third row: 5 vs. 2 + 2 = 4. Same. Fourth row: 5 vs. 2 + 2 = 4. Fifth row: 5 vs. 2. 5 > 2. So all rows except the first and last have diagonal entry equal to 5, which is greater than the sum of off-diagonals (4). First and last rows are even more dominant. So the matrix is strictly diagonally dominant with positive diagonals. Therefore, by the theorem, it should be positive definite. That might be the shortcut they're looking for. So the answer could be to check diagonal dominance. But let me verify if that theorem applies here.\n\nYes, the Levy-Desplanques theorem states that a strictly diagonally dominant matrix with real positive diagonal entries is positive definite. Since our matrix is symmetric, tridiagonal, and meets the strict diagonal dominance condition, that should suffice. Therefore, the user can apply this theorem instead of computing eigenvalues or the quadratic form. That's a much faster method. So the key assumptions here are the symmetry, tridiagonal structure, and the entries leading to diagonal dominance.",
