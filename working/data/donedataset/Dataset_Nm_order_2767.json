    "Content": "I am studying for an Analysis prelim and I am stuck on how to show that the following space of Holder continuous functions is complete: $$\\Lambda_{\\alpha}([0,1]) = \\{f: [0,1] \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R} \\mid \\sup_{x,y \\in [0,1], x\\neq y} \\frac{|f(x) - f(y)|}{|x-y|^{\\alpha}} < \\infty \\text{ and } 0< \\alpha \\leq 1\\}$$\nwith the norm $\\| \\cdot \\|_{\\Lambda_{\\alpha}}$ defined by \n$$\\|f\\|_{\\Lambda_{\\alpha}} = |f(0)| + \\sup_{x,y \\in [0,1], x\\neq y} \\frac{|f(x) - f(y)|}{|x-y|^{\\alpha}}$$\nI think its easy to see that $\\Lambda_{\\alpha}([0,1]) \\subset B([0,1])$, i.e., it is a subset of bounded functions on $[0,1]$ which is complete.  My thought is that if I let $\\{f_n\\}$ be a Cauchy sequence in $\\Lambda_{\\alpha}([0,1])$ and let $f \\in B([0,1])$, such that $f_n \\rightarrow f$ in the uniform norm, then we can show $f \\in \\Lambda_{\\alpha}([0,1])$ and that $f_n \\rightarrow f$ in the Holder norm defined above.  Not sure how to show this though.  Perhaps I could also somehow show that any absolutely convergent series converges in $\\Lambda_\\alpha$, but I'm not sure how to do this either.  Any help would be appreciated.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I personally find it easier to work with an $f$ that has been defined differently. Let $(f_n)_{n=1}^\\infty$ be Cauchy in $\\Lambda_\\alpha([0,1])$. You can use the Cauchy criterion to show $f_n(x)$ converges pointwise to some $f(x)$ for any $x \\in [0,1]$ (I'll let you work through the details). So define $f(x)$ to be the pointwise limit in $(\\mathbb{R}, |\\cdot |)$ as $n \\to \\infty$ of $f_n(x)$ for all $x \\in [0,1]$. Now we need to show: 1) $f_n \\rightarrow f$ in the Hölder norm 2) $f$ is Hölder continuous on $[0,1]$ Task 1 is a bit technical. Consider each term separately. Fix $\\epsilon > 0$. Since $f_n$ is Cauchy there exists $N$ such that for all $m,n \\geq N$, $|f_n(0) -f_m(0)| < \\epsilon/2$. Fix $n$ and let $m \\rightarrow \\infty$ to get $|f_n(0) -f(0)| < \\epsilon/2$. For the other term we have for all $x,y \\in [0,1]$, $m,n \\geq N$ as above, $$\\frac{|f_n(x) - f_n(y) - (f_m(x) - f_m(y))|}{|x-y|^\\alpha} < \\epsilon/2$$ Again, fix $m$ and take $n$ to $\\infty$. Some rearranging will yield $$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{f_n(x) - f_n(y)}{(x-y)^\\alpha} = \\frac{f(x) - f(y)}{(x-y)^\\alpha}$$ in $(\\mathbb{R}, |\\cdot |)$. But that implies for $n \\geq N$, $$\\sup_{x,y \\in [0,1], x\\neq y} \\frac{|f_n(x) - f_n(y) - (f(x) - f(y))|}{|x-y|^\\alpha} < \\epsilon/2$$ Combining the two terms and by the triangle inequality we get convergence in $\\Lambda_\\alpha([0,1])$. Task 2 is pretty quick. By the above results and the reverse triangle inequality, for some $N$, $x,y \\in [0,1]$, $n \\geq N$, $$\\frac{|f(x) - f(y)|}{|x-y|^\\alpha} - \\frac{|f_n(x) - f_n(y)|}{|x-y|^\\alpha} < \\epsilon$$ Let $\\epsilon = 1$. Since $f_n(x) \\in \\Lambda_\\alpha([0,1])$ there exists a $C>0$ such that $|f_n(x) - f_n(y)| \\leq C|x-y|^\\alpha$. Use this to show  $$\\frac{|f(x) - f(y)|}{|x-y|^\\alpha} < 1 + C$$ and so $f \\in \\Lambda_\\alpha([0,1])$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions in the problem. The question is about showing that the space of Hölder continuous functions with a specific norm is complete, hence a Banach space. \n\nStarting with the title: \"Holder Continuous Functions on [0,1] are complete + Banach space\". The key elements here are the space Λ_α([0,1]), the norm defined, and the requirement to prove completeness. \n\nLooking at the problem statement in the question: The user defines the space Λ_α([0,1]) as functions from [0,1] to R with a finite Hölder seminorm (sup of |f(x)-f(y)| / |x-y|^α) where 0 < α ≤ 1. The norm given is |f(0)| plus that seminorm. The goal is to show this space is complete under this norm, making it a Banach space.\n\nAssumptions to list here would include the domain and codomain of the functions in the space, the parameters like α being between 0 and 1, the structure of the norm, and the properties required for the functions (Hölder continuity). Each assumption should be a single line addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo breaking it down:\n\n- The functions f map [0,1] to R.\n- The Hölder exponent α satisfies 0 < α ≤ 1.\n- The Hölder seminorm (the sup part) is finite for each function in the space.\n- The norm on the space is the sum of |f(0)| and the Hölder seminorm.\n\nThe problem is to prove that Λ_α([0,1]) with this norm is complete (i.e., every Cauchy sequence converges in the space).\n\nI need to ensure that each assumption is listed separately. For example, the definition of the space includes multiple parts: domain, codomain, and the seminorm condition. Each of these should be their own assumption. The norm definition combines two parts, so maybe split into the seminorm and the |f(0)| part, but according to the example, perhaps the norm's definition as a whole is one assumption. Wait, the example had assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" separately. So here, the components of the norm should be separate if they're distinct conditions.\n\nWait, the norm is defined as |f(0)| plus the seminorm. But the problem statement includes the space Λ_α([0,1]) with that norm. So the assumptions would include the definition of the space and the structure of the norm.\n\nBut to follow the example, each assumption is about a single property. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- The space consists of functions f: [0,1] → ℝ.\n- For each f in the space, the Hölder seminorm sup_{x≠y} |f(x)-f(y)| / |x-y|^α is finite.\n- The exponent α satisfies 0 < α ≤ 1.\n- The norm on the space is given by ||f|| = |f(0)| + the Hölder seminorm.\n\nThat's four assumptions, each addressing one aspect. The problem is to show that this space is complete (i.e., every Cauchy sequence converges in the space), hence a Banach space.\n\nNow, checking the original question again to ensure nothing is missed. The user mentions that Λ_α is a subset of bounded functions, which is complete, but their approach is to take a Cauchy sequence in Λ_α, have it converge uniformly to some f in B([0,1]), then show f is in Λ_α and convergence is in the Hölder norm. However, the problem as stated in the title and the user's initial statement is to show completeness. So the core problem is proving completeness, and the assumptions are those defining the space and the norm.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have these assumptions listed, each on a separate line, and the problem statement to prove completeness.",
