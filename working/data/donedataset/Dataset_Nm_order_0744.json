    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let me collect all the comments into a single answer. Since the space of integrable simple functions is dense in $L^p(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, \\mu)$ for all $p\\in[1,+\\infty)$, and in addition, all simple functions are in $L^\\infty(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, \\mu)$, we have that $\\bigcap_{1\\leq p\\leq\\infty}L^p(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, \\mu)$ is dense in $L^q(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, \\mu)$ for all $q\\in[1,+\\infty)$. If $q=\\infty$ the answer depends on whether or not $\\mu$ is finite. If $\\mu$ is finite, then $L^\\infty(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, \\mu)\\subseteq L^p(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, \\mu)$ for each $p$, so obviously we can put $q=\\infty$ above. If $\\mu$ is infinite (like the Lebesgue measure), then any nonzero constant function is in $L^\\infty$, but very far from any integrable function (since no integrable function can be bounded away from zero on a set of infinite measure). Worth mentioning, if inessential for this exercise, is that if $\\Omega,\\mu$ are sufficiently well-behaved ($\\Omega$ is locally compact Hausdorff, $\\mu$ is inner and outer regular, locally finite), then compactly supported continuous functions are dense in each $L^p(\\mu)$ with $p<\\infty$. This applies in particular to Haar measures on locally compact Hausdorff groups, such as the Lebesgue measure.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable mathematics professor who can parse and structure a question from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The example provided shows that the assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing a single property or condition of one object, followed by the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the original problem from Math Stack Exchange:\n\n**Title**: Why is \\( L^1(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\cap L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\) dense in \\( L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\)?\n\n**Question**: In Lieb and Loss's Analysis, they mentioned that \\( L^1(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\cap L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\) is dense in \\( L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\) (dense with respect to the \\( L^2 \\) norm, I think). But I didn't find its proof in the book. So I wonder why it is? Does this conclusion hold for \\( L^1(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, \\mu) \\cap L^2(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, \\mu) \\) for any measure space \\( (\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, \\mu) \\)? Are there similar statements if we replace \\( L^1 \\) with \\( L^p \\), and \\( L^2 \\) with \\( L^q \\) for \\( p \\leq q \\in (0, \\infty ] \\) or \\( \\in [1, \\infty] \\)? Thanks and regards!\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The main question is about the density of \\( L^1 \\cap L^2 \\) in \\( L^2 \\) over \\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\). Then there are follow-up questions about general measure spaces and replacing \\( L^1 \\) and \\( L^2 \\) with other \\( L^p \\) spaces.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions should list specific conditions. Let's parse the problem.\n\nThe primary problem is: Prove \\( L^1(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\cap L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\) is dense in \\( L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\).\n\nAssumptions here would be:\n\n1. The space considered is \\( L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\).\n2. The subset in question is \\( L^1(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\cap L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\).\n3. The density is with respect to the \\( L^2 \\) norm.\n\nWait, the original question mentions \"dense in \\( L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\)\" and specifies \"dense wrt the \\( L^2 \\) norm, I think\". So the norm is the \\( L^2 \\) norm. However, in the example provided by the user, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\", but in the original problem, that was part of the problem statement. Wait, the example given by the user had:\n\nOriginal problem was about proving A(n) divisible by 91. The formatted assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the original problem, the user said \"for every integer n\", so the assumption in the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, but in the problem statement, it's part of the quantifier. Maybe the user wants to list all underlying assumptions, even if they are part of the problem's premise.\n\nSo in the current problem, the main assumptions would be:\n\n- The space is \\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\) with the Lebesgue measure (since \\( L^p(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\) is usually with Lebesgue measure unless specified otherwise).\n- The measure space in the first part is \\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\), but the follow-up questions ask about any measure space.\n\nBut the example given by the user only includes assumptions that are directly mentioned in the problem. For instance, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is \"n is an integer\". The second assumption in the example is \"n is divisible by 7\", but wait, the original problem didn't state that. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nBut in the formatted problem, the assumption is \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", which would mean that the conclusion holds for all integers n, not assuming n is divisible by 7. But the formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the user made an error in their example? Because if the problem is to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91, then the assumptions shouldn't include \"n is divisible by 7\" unless the problem statement restricts n to multiples of 7. But in this case, the problem says \"for every integer n\", so the only assumption is that n is an integer. The conclusion is that A(n) is divisible by 91. However, 91 is 7*13. So maybe in the problem, the user intended that n is such that A(n) is divisible by 91, but the example is a bit confusing. Perhaps the example was a typo or misunderstanding.\n\nBut given that the user provided that example, perhaps the way to structure assumptions is to list all conditions that are given or required for the problem. So in the current problem about density of L1 intersect L2 in L2, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- The space is \\( L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\).\n- The subset \\( L^1(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\cap L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\).\n- The topology is induced by the \\( L^2 \\) norm.\n\nBut perhaps more precisely, since the problem is about density in \\( L^2 \\), the key assumptions are the spaces involved. The user also asks whether the conclusion holds for any measure space and other L^p and L^q spaces. However, the main problem is about \\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\), so maybe the measure space is \\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\) with Lebesgue measure. But the question then generalizes to any measure space.\n\nBut the user wants to structure the problem as per the example. The example included assumptions that were part of the problem statement, not necessarily the solution. So in the original example, the problem was to prove for every integer n, so the assumption is \"n is an integer\". Then the problem statement is to prove divisibility by 91. However, in the example given by the user, they added an extra assumption \"n is divisible by 7\", which may be incorrect. Perhaps the user made a mistake in their example. Because if the problem is for every integer n, then there is no need to assume n is divisible by 7. So maybe the example is faulty, but we have to follow the structure regardless.\n\nSo returning to the current problem. The main question is: Why is \\( L^1(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\cap L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\) dense in \\( L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\)? Then the follow-up questions are about general measure spaces and other L^p spaces.\n\nBut according to the task, the user wants to \"filter the unrelated information\" and structure the problem. The example included only the primary problem and its assumptions, even though the original question had more parts. The example formatted only the main problem, ignoring the follow-up questions. So perhaps in this case, we should focus on the main problem: proving density in \\( L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\), and list assumptions related to that.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n1. The space is \\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\).\n2. The function spaces are \\( L^1(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\) and \\( L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\).\n3. The intersection \\( L^1(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\cap L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\) is considered as a subset of \\( L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\).\n4. The density is with respect to the \\( L^2 \\) norm.\n\nBut perhaps more concisely:\n\nAssumptions:\n- \\( L^1(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\cap L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\) is a subset of \\( L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\).\n- The topology on \\( L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\) is induced by its norm.\n\nBut maybe the key is to list each assumption line by line. Each line should address one property or condition of one object.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nThe space is \\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\) with Lebesgue measure.\n\\( L^1(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\cap L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\) is considered as a subset of \\( L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\).\nThe density is with respect to the \\( L^2 \\) norm.\n\nBut the original problem doesn't specify the measure, but in the context of \\( L^p \\) spaces over \\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\), it's standard to use Lebesgue measure. However, since the follow-up question asks about arbitrary measure spaces, maybe the assumption for the main problem is that the measure space is \\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\) with Lebesgue measure.\n\nAlternatively, since the main problem is about \\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\), that's an assumption. The other parts are about different measure spaces.\n\nBut the user's example only included assumptions directly mentioned in the problem. The original problem in the example didn't mention divisibility by 7, but the formatted problem included it. Wait, that example seems inconsistent. Wait, the original example problem was:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n + 1) - 6^n (3^n + 2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\", which is not in the original problem. That seems incorrect. Maybe the example has a mistake. Perhaps the user intended a different problem where n is divisible by 7? Or maybe they confused the example. Anyway, perhaps the user's example is incorrect, but we have to proceed with the given structure.\n\nIn any case, for the current problem, the main part is about \\( L^1 \\cap L^2 \\) being dense in \\( L^2 \\) on \\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\). The follow-up questions are about general measure spaces and other L^p spaces, but according to the example, those might be considered separate problems. But the user's instruction says to \"filter the unrelated informations\" and structure the problem. So the primary problem is the first question: proving density in \\( L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\). The rest are additional questions, which might be considered as separate problems. But the user's example didn't include multiple problems, so perhaps we should focus on the main question.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions for the main problem are:\n\n- The underlying space is \\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\).\n- The function space considered is \\( L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\).\n- The subset is \\( L^1(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\cap L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\).\n- The density is with respect to the \\( L^2 \\) norm.\n\nBut each assumption should be a single line, each addressing one property or condition of one object.\n\nSo breaking it down:\n\nAssumption:\nThe space is \\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\).\nThe measure on \\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\) is Lebesgue measure.\n\\( L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\) is the space of square-integrable functions.\n\\( L^1(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\cap L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\) is a subset of \\( L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\).\nThe topology on \\( L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\) is induced by the \\( L^2 \\) norm.\n\nBut maybe some of these are implicit. Since the user's example only listed the assumptions that were explicitly part of the problem statement. For example, in the original example, the problem was about integers n, so the assumption was n is an integer, and another assumption (possibly incorrect) that n is divisible by 7. But perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions are just the spaces involved.\n\nAlternatively, the assumptions might be:\n\n- \\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\) is equipped with the Lebesgue measure.\n- \\( L^1(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\cap L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\) is considered as a subset of \\( L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\).\n- The density is in the \\( L^2 \\) norm.\n\nBut to follow the example's style, which listed two assumptions for the problem: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n\". So perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The space is \\( L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\).\n- The subset is \\( L^1(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\cap L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\).\n\nBut the problem is to prove density. The user's example included the divisibility by 7 as an assumption, which might have been a mistake. Without more examples, it's hard to be certain. But given that, perhaps the assumptions here are:\n\nAssumption:\nThe function space is \\( L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\).\nThe subset \\( L^1(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\cap L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\).\nDensity is considered with respect to the \\( L^2 \\) norm.\n\nProblem:\nProve that \\( L^1(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\cap L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\) is dense in \\( L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\).\n\nThe additional questions about measure spaces and other L^p spaces are separate and might be considered as different problems, so they are filtered out as per the user's instruction to \"filter the unrelated informations\".\n\nThus, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe function space is \\( L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\).\nThe subset is \\( L^1(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\cap L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\).\nDensity is with respect to the \\( L^2 \\) norm.\n\nProblem:\nProve that \\( L^1(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\cap L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\) is dense in \\( L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\).\n\nWait, but in the user's example, the assumptions were listed as separate bullet points, each on a new line. In the problem example, the assumptions were:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn is divisible by 7.\n\nSo each assumption is a separate line. Therefore, in this problem, each assumption should be a separate line.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe space is \\( L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\).\nThe subset is \\( L^1(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\cap L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\).\nDensity is considered with respect to the \\( L^2 \\) norm.\n\nProblem:\nProve that \\( L^1(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\cap L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\) is dense in \\( L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\).\n\nBut maybe the measure space is also an assumption. For example, \\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\) with Lebesgue measure. But since the follow-up question asks about any measure space, perhaps the main problem's assumption is that the measure space is \\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\) with Lebesgue measure. But the problem statement doesn't specify, so maybe it's implicit.\n\nAlternatively, the assumptions could be:\n\nAssumption:\n\\( (\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, \\mu) = (\\mathbb{R}^n, \\mathcal{L}, m) \\), where \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) is the Lebesgue σ-algebra and \\( m \\) is Lebesgue measure.\nThe space \\( L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\) is considered with the \\( L^2 \\)-norm.\nThe subset \\( L^1(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\cap L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\) is non-empty.\n\nBut I think the key is to list the assumptions as per the problem's explicit statements. The problem states \\( L^1(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\cap L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\) and \\( L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\), so the assumptions are about these spaces. The density is with respect to the \\( L^2 \\) norm, which is part of the problem's statement.\n\nThus, the final formatted problem would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nThe function space is \\( L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\),\nThe subset \\( L^1(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\cap L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\) is considered,\nDensity is with respect to the \\( L^2 \\) norm.\nProblem: \nProve that \\( L^1(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\cap L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\) is dense in \\( L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\).\n###END_OF_FORMAT###\n\nBut to ensure each assumption addresses only one property or condition applied to one object, perhaps:\n\nAssumption: \n\\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\) is equipped with Lebesgue measure,\n\\( L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\) is the space of square-integrable functions,\n\\( L^1(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\cap L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\) is a subset of \\( L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\),\nThe topology on \\( L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\) is induced by the \\( L^2 \\) norm.\n\nProblem: \nProve that \\( L^1(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\cap L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\) is dense in \\( L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\).\n\nBut maybe that's overcomplicating. Since in the example, the assumptions were just the conditions on n, here the key is the space and the subset. Given the example, the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. The original problem mentions \\( L^1 \\cap L^2 \\) and \\( L^2 \\), so the assumptions are those spaces. The density is with respect to the L2 norm, which is part of the problem's context.\n\nSo simplifying:\n\nAssumption: \n\\( L^1(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\cap L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\) is a subset of \\( L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\),\nThe topology on \\( L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\) is induced by the \\( L^2 \\) norm.\n\nProblem: \nProve that \\( L^1(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\cap L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\) is dense in \\( L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\).\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is in \\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\), that's an assumption about the space.\n\nAssumption: \nThe measure space is \\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\) with Lebesgue measure,\nThe subset \\( L^1(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\cap L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\) is considered,\nThe density is in the sense of the \\( L^2 \\) norm.\n\nProblem: \nProve that \\( L^1(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\cap L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\) is dense in \\( L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\).\n\nI think this is reasonable.
