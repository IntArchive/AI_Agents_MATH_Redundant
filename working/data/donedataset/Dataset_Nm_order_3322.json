    "Content": "Define sequences $\\{a_n\\},\\,\\{b_n\\}$ by mutual recurrence relations: $$a_0=b_0=1,\\quad a_{n+1}=a_n+b_n,\\quad b_{n+1}=a_n\\cdot b_n.\\tag1$$ The sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ begins: $$1,\\,2,\\,3,\\,5,\\,11,\\,41,\\,371,\\,13901,\\,5033531,\\,69782910161,\\,...\\tag2$$ It appears in OEIS as $A003686$ under the name \"Number of genealogical $1$ - $2$ rooted trees of height $n$ .\" (note that indexing starts with $1$ rather than $0$ in OEIS). It seems that for $n\\to\\infty$ , $$\\ln\\ln a_n=n\\cdot\\ln\\phi+c+o(1),\\tag3$$ where $\\phi=\\frac{1+\\sqrt5}2$ is the golden ratio, the last term $o(1)$ exponentially decays in absolute value (and seems to have alternating signs for $n\\ge8$ ), and the constant $$c\\approx-1.11328370529375397170010672464407271138948509227239...\\tag4$$ (see more digits here ) The equivalent asymptotics is given in OEIS without proof. How can we prove $(3)$ ? Is there a closed form or some alternative representation (integral, series, product, continued fraction, etc) for the constant $c$ ? Is it irrational? Is there an efficient way to numerically calculate $c$ to a higher precision?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Given a sequence $\\{A_n\\}$ with the Fibonacci recurrence relation\n$$A_{n+2} = A_{n+1} + A_n$$\nwe get the well-known asymptotic\n$$A_n \\sim C\\phi^n$$\nwhere $\\phi$ is the golden ratio and $C$ depends on the initial terms $A_1$ and $A_2$.  For example if $A_1 = A_2 = 1$ we get the Fibonacci sequence and $C = 1/\\sqrt{5}$.  But if we start with different initial values we get a difference constant $C$. Now consider a more general recurrence:\n$$A_{n+2} = A_{n+1} + A_n + g_n$$\nwhere $g_n \\rightarrow 0$ as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$.  Then it seems clear that we'll also get the asymptotic\n$$A_n \\sim C\\phi^n$$\nwhere now the constant $C$ depends also on the function $g_n$. In particular, for our sequence we have\n$$\\log a_{n+2} = \\log a_{n+1} + \\log a_{n} + \\log \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{a_n} - \\frac{a_n}{a_{n+1}}\\right)$$\nwhere the last term goes to zero pretty quickly, so we have\n$$\\log a_n \\sim C\\phi^n$$\nfor some $C$, but I am doubtful that we can get a closed formula for $C$. DETAILED PROOF ADDED LATER: LEMMA:  Let\n$$A_{n+2} = A_{n+1} + A_n + c$$\nbe a recurrent sequence with constant $c$ and initial conditions $A_1$ and $A_2$.  Then\n$$A_n = \\frac{\\phi^{n-1}-\\psi^{n-1}}{\\sqrt{5}} A_2 + \\frac{\\phi^{n-2}-\\psi^{n-2}}{\\sqrt{5}} A_1 + \\left[\\left(\\frac{5+3\\sqrt{5}}{10}\\right)\\phi^{n-2} + \\left(\\frac{5-3\\sqrt{5}}{10}\\right)\\psi^{n-2} -1 \\right]c$$\nwhere $\\phi = (1+\\sqrt{5})/2$ and $\\psi = (1-\\sqrt{5})/2$.\nIn particular, as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$,\n$$A_n = \\left(\\frac{\\phi A_2 + A_1}{\\sqrt{5}} + \\frac{5+3\\sqrt{5}}{10} c\\right)\\phi^{n-2} - c + o(1).$$ PROPOSITION:  Let\n$$A_{n+2} = A_{n+1} + A_n + c_n$$\nbe a recurrent sequence with initial conditions $A_1$ and $A_2$ and $c_n$ a bounded sequence.  Then\n$$A_n \\sim C \\phi^n$$\nfor some constant $C$ and $\\phi = (1+\\sqrt{5})/2$, i.e. the limit\n$$\\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{A_n}{\\phi^n}$$\nexists. Proof of LEMMA:  Write recurrence in matrix form and take matrix powers. Proof of PROPOSITION:  We can use the Lemma to bound our sequence by sequences with constants $c = M$ and $c = -M$ to see that $A_n/\\phi^n$ is bounded, say $|A_n/\\phi^n| \\leq B.$ We will further prove that $A_n/\\phi^n$ is a Cauchy sequence, and therefore converges to a limit.  We have $|c_n| < M$ for some $M$.  Let $\\epsilon > 0$.  Choose $N$ large enough so that $M / \\phi^N < \\epsilon$.  For $n \\geq N$, we again use the Lemma to bound our sequence by sequences with constants $c = M$ and $c = -M$, but now starting from at initial values $A_{N-1}$ and $A_N$.  So we have\n$$\\left| A_n - \\left(\\frac{\\phi^{n-N+1}-\\psi^{n-N+1}}{\\sqrt{5}} A_N + \\frac{\\phi^{n-N}-\\psi^{n-N}}{\\sqrt{5}} A_{N-1} \\right)\\right|$$\n$$\\leq \\left(\\left(\\frac{5+3\\sqrt{5}}{10}\\right)\\phi^{n-N} + \\left(\\frac{5-3\\sqrt{5}}{10}\\right)\\psi^{n-N} -1 \\right)M.$$\nWe divide through by $\\phi^n$ to get\n$$\\left| \\frac{A_n}{\\phi^n} - \\left(\\phi \\frac{1 - (\\psi/\\phi)^{n-N+1}}{\\sqrt{5}} \\frac{A_N}{\\phi^N} + \\frac{1}{\\phi}\\frac{1-(\\psi/\\phi)^{n-N}}{\\sqrt{5}} \\frac{A_{N-1}}{\\phi^{N-1}} \\right)\\right|$$\n$$\\leq \\left(\\left(\\frac{5+3\\sqrt{5}}{10}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{5-3\\sqrt{5}}{10}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\psi}{\\phi}\\right)^{n-N} - \\frac{1}{\\phi^{n-N}} \\right) \\frac{M}{\\phi^N} < 2\\epsilon.$$ Now choose $N_2 > N$ large enough so that $|\\psi/\\phi|^{N_2-N} B < \\epsilon$.  Then for $n \\geq N_2$ we have\n$$\\left| \\frac{A_n}{\\phi^n} - \\left(\\phi \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} \\frac{A_N}{\\phi^N} + \\frac{1}{\\phi}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} \\frac{A_{N-1}}{\\phi^{N-1}} \\right)\\right| < 3 \\epsilon.$$\nBy the triangle inequality, when $n \\geq N_2$, we have\n$$\\left| \\frac{A_n}{\\phi^n} - \\frac{A_{N_2}}{\\phi^{N_2}}\\right| < 6 \\epsilon,$$\nproving that $A_n/\\phi^n$ is a Cauchy sequence.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the original question, sequences {a_n} and {b_n} are defined by mutual recurrence relations. The initial conditions are a0 = b0 = 1. Then, a_{n+1} = a_n + b_n and b_{n+1} = a_n * b_n. The problem is about proving an asymptotic formula for ln ln a_n, which is given as n*ln(phi) + c + o(1), where phi is the golden ratio. There are also questions about the constant c, like its closed form, whether it's irrational, and how to compute it more precisely.\n\nNow, according to the example provided, assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. The initial conditions are a0 = 1 and b0 = 1. The recurrence relations for a_{n+1} and b_{n+1} each need to be separate assumptions. The problem statement is to prove the asymptotic behavior and address the questions about the constant c.\n\nWait, the original problem also mentions that the indexing in OEIS starts at 1 instead of 0, but I don't think that's an assumption needed for solving the problem. The user example didn't include the OEIS note in the assumptions. So maybe that's extra info to be filtered out. Similarly, the mention of the sequence's name and OEIS entry might be context but not assumptions.\n\nSo the key assumptions are the initial conditions and the recurrence relations. The problem is to prove the given asymptotic formula for ln ln a_n and the questions about the constant c.\n\nTherefore, the formatted assumptions should be:\n\n- a₀ = 1\n- b₀ = 1\n- For all n ≥ 0, a_{n+1} = a_n + b_n\n- For all n ≥ 0, b_{n+1} = a_n · b_n\n\nThe problem part includes proving the asymptotics and the questions about c.\n\nWait, the problem statement also asks about the closed form, alternative representations, irrationality, and numerical calculation of c. Should all these be part of the problem? The example included multiple questions in the problem statement, so yes. The original problem has multiple parts: proving (3), and then several questions about c. So the problem section should list all these.\n\nSo putting it all together, the assumptions are the initial terms and the recurrence relations. The problem includes proving the asymptotics and the questions about the constant c.",
