    "Content": "Show that if $A,B \\in M_{n \\times  n}(K)$ , where $K=\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}$ , then the matrices $AB$ and $BA$ have same eigenvalues. I do that like this: let $\\lambda$ be the eigenvalue of $B$ and $v\\neq 0$ $ABv=A\\lambda v=\\lambda Av=BAv$ the third equation is valid, because $Av$ is the eigenvector of $B$ . Am I doing it right?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "It suffices to show that $AB$ and $BA$ have the same characteristic polynomial. First assume that $A$ is invertible then $$\\chi_{AB}(x)=\\det(AB-xI)=\\det A\\det(B-xA^{-1})\\\\=\\det(B-xA^{-1})\\det A=\\det(BA-xI)=\\chi_{BA}(x)$$\nNow since $\\operatorname{GL}_n(K)$ is dense in $\\operatorname{M}_n(K)$ then there's a sequence of invertible matrices $(A_n)$ convergent to $A$ and by the continuity of the $\\det$ function we have\n$$\\chi_{AB}(x)=\\det(AB-xI)=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\det(A_nB-xI)=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\det(BA_n-xI)\\\\=\\det(BA-xI)=\\chi_{BA}(x).$$",

They assume that if $v$ is an eigenvector of $B$, then $Av$ is automatically an eigenvector of $B$, which is not necessarily true. A valid proof would instead:  \n1. For $\\lambda \\neq 0$, show that if $ABv = \\lambda v$, then $BA(Bv) = \\lambda (Bv)$ (assuming $Bv \\neq 0$).  \n2. For $\\lambda = 0$, observe that $\\det(AB) = \\det(BA)$, so $AB$ and $BA$ share the same determinant (and hence both have eigenvalue $0$ if applicable).  \n\nThus, $AB$ and $BA$ have identical eigenvalues (counting multiplicities) when $A,B$ are square matrices of the same size.",
    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let's take a look at this problem. The user is asking whether their approach to proving that AB and BA have the same eigenvalues is correct. They mention using the eigenvalue equation with a non-zero vector v, and then manipulating it to get ABv = BAv. Let me break down their steps to check for any errors.\n\nFirst, the user starts by letting λ be an eigenvalue of B, with v ≠ 0 as the corresponding eigenvector. Then they write ABv = Aλv, which is correct because Bv = λv. Next, they factor out the λ to get λAv. So far, so good. Then they claim that this equals BAv because Av is an eigenvector of B. Wait a minute, here's a potential mistake. The user assumes that Av is an eigenvector of B, but that's not necessarily true. Unless A is invertible or has some specific property, Av might not be an eigenvector of B. For example, if A is not invertible, Av could even be the zero vector, which can't be an eigenvector. So this step seems flawed.\n\nAdditionally, the problem statement mentions that A and B are square matrices of size n x n over K (which is either real or complex numbers). The user's approach doesn't consider cases where λ might be zero or non-zero, or the possibility that AB and BA might have different algebraic multiplicities for their eigenvalues. Also, in the case where K is the real numbers, eigenvalues might not even exist, but since the field is specified as either ℝ or ℂ, and ℂ is algebraically closed, we can at least say that eigenvalues exist in ℂ. However, the problem states K as either, so maybe the proof needs to handle real matrices where eigenvalues might not be real, but the user's approach doesn't address this.\n\nAnother point is that the user only considers eigenvalues of B, but the problem is about eigenvalues of AB and BA. Even if B has an eigenvalue λ, AB and BA might have eigenvalues that are not directly related to λ. The standard approach to this problem usually involves showing that the characteristic polynomials of AB and BA are the same, except possibly for a factor of t^{m-n} when the matrices are of different sizes, but since here A and B are both n x n, that complication doesn't arise. Alternatively, one can use the fact that if λ ≠ 0 is an eigenvalue of AB, then it's also an eigenvalue of BA, by manipulating the equations ABx = λx to get BA(Bx) = λ(Bx), provided Bx ≠ 0. But if λ = 0, then AB and BA might have different ranks, but since determinant of AB and BA are equal, the product of eigenvalues (counted with multiplicity) would be the same. However, the user's approach doesn't handle the case when λ = 0 or when Av = 0.\n\nSo, in summary, the user's mistake is assuming that Av is an eigenvector of B without justification, which isn't generally true. Their proof is incomplete and incorrect in that step. The correct approach would involve either considering invertible matrices, using the characteristic polynomial, or handling the cases where λ is zero or non-zero separately.",
