    "Content": "I don't even have an idea of how to start working on this one: Let $p(n)$ denote the greatest prime number that divides $n.$ Show that there exists infinitely many positive integers $m$ such that $$p(m-1)<p(m)<p(m+1).$$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "For briefer notation let $n \\in G$, iff $p(n-1) < p(n) < p(n+1)$ (G is for \"good\"). Also, say that $n  \\in P$ iff $p(n) > p(n-1),p(n+1)$ (P is for \"peak\"). The key to the solution is the following simple observation: Observation: If $n \\in P$ then either $n^2 \\in G$ or $n^2 \\in P$. Proof: Suppose that $p(n) > p(n-1),p(n+1)$ and $n^2 \\not \\in G$. Because $n^2-1 = (n-1)(n+1)$, we have that $p(n^2) = p(n) > p(n^2-1)$. Thus, the only way for $n^2 \\not \\in G$ is if $p(n^2) > p(n^2+1)$. Then clearly $n^2 \\in P$. $\\square$ We want to prove that $G$ is infinite. For a proof by contradiction, suppose that $G$ is finite. Because $\\limsup p(n) = + \\infty$, we can select arbitrarily large $n_0$ with $p(n_0)>p(n_0-1)$. If $n_0 > \\max G$ (so in particular $n_0 \\not \\in G$), then $p(n_0) > p(n_0+1)$ and hence $n_0 \\in P$. Let $n_1:= n_0^2$, $n_2 = n_1^2$, and generally $n_{i+1} = n_i^2$ (so in closed form $n_i = n_0^{2^i}$). Because of the above observation, and because $n_0^2 \\not \\in G$, we have $n_1 = n_0^2 \\in P$. Likewise, $n_2 = n_1^2 \\in P$, and inductively $n_i \\in P$ for all $i$. Let $p_0 = p(n_0)$. Clearly, $p(n_i) = p_0$ for all $i$. In paricular, $p_0 > p(n_i+1)$ for all $i$. Let $m_i := n_i+1$, and note that $m_{i+1} = (m_i-1)^2+1$. Thus, we have $m_{i+1} \\equiv 2 \\pmod{m_i}$, $m_{i+2} \\equiv 2 \\pmod{m_i}$ and generally  $m_{j} \\equiv 2 \\pmod{m_i}$ for $j > i$. Thus, $m_i$ do not share any prime factors, except for $2$. Because $m_i$ are obviously larger than $2$ and are not divisible by $4$, we see that $p(m_i) > 2$ all take different values for different $i$. At the same time, $p(m_i) < p_0$ by construction. Thus, we arrive at a contradiction proving the initial claim.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. The question is to show that there are infinitely many positive integers m such that the greatest prime factor of m-1 is less than the greatest prime factor of m, which in turn is less than the greatest prime factor of m+1. In symbols, p(m-1) < p(m) < p(m+1), where p(n) denotes the greatest prime divisor of n.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. We need to find infinitely many m where the sequence of the largest prime factors of m-1, m, and m+1 is strictly increasing. So, for each such m, when you look at the prime factors of m-1, the largest one is smaller than the largest prime factor of m, which is itself smaller than the largest prime factor of m+1.\n\nMy initial thought is to look for patterns or constructions that can generate such m. Since the problem is about primes, maybe using primes themselves or numbers around primes could help. Let's consider some examples to get a feel.\n\nTake m = 2. Then m-1 = 1, which has no prime factors, so p(1) is undefined. That's not helpful. Next, m = 3: m-1 = 2 (p=2), m=3 (p=3), m+1=4 (p=2). So here p(m-1)=2 < p(m)=3, but p(m+1)=2, which is less than p(m). So this doesn't satisfy the inequality.\n\nHow about m=4: m-1=3 (p=3), m=4 (p=2), m+1=5 (p=5). Here, p(m-1)=3, p(m)=2, which is decreasing, so no good.\n\nm=5: m-1=4 (p=2), m=5 (p=5), m+1=6 (p=3). So p(m-1)=2 < p(m)=5, but p(m+1)=3 < p(m). Not satisfying.\n\nm=6: m-1=5 (p=5), m=6 (p=3), m+1=7 (p=7). Here, p(m-1)=5 > p(m)=3, so no.\n\nm=7: m-1=6 (p=3), m=7 (p=7), m+1=8 (p=2). Then p(m-1)=3 < p(m)=7, but p(m+1)=2 < p(m). Still, the last term breaks the chain.\n\nm=15: m-1=14 (p=7), m=15 (p=5), m+1=16 (p=2). Decreasing again.\n\nHmm, maybe primes aren't the right approach here. Let's think differently. Suppose m is such that m is a prime number. Then p(m) = m. Then m+1 is composite, so p(m+1) could be a prime less than m+1. For example, if m is a prime, then m+1 is even if m is odd (which all primes except 2 are). So p(m+1) would be at most (m+1)/2, which is less than m if m > 2. So in that case, p(m+1) < p(m). So primes themselves won't work because m+1's largest prime factor is smaller than m.\n\nWait, but if m is a prime plus 1? Let's see. Let’s take m = p where p is a prime. Wait, same as before. Maybe m is between two primes? For example, m = 9: m-1=8 (p=2), m=9 (p=3), m+1=10 (p=5). Here p(m-1)=2 < p(m)=3 < p(m+1)=5. So that works. So m=9 is a valid example. Similarly, m=15: m-1=14 (p=7), m=15 (p=5), m+1=16 (p=2). That doesn't work. Wait, m=25: m-1=24 (p=3), m=25 (p=5), m+1=26 (p=13). So here, p(m-1)=3 < p(m)=5 < p(m+1)=13. So m=25 is another example.\n\nSo maybe numbers of the form m = k^2 where k is a prime? Wait, m=25 (which is 5^2) worked. Let's check m=49: m-1=48 (p=3), m=49 (p=7), m+1=50 (p=5). Here, p(m+1)=5 < p(m)=7, so that doesn't work. Hmm.\n\nWait, m=25: m+1=26, which factors into 2*13, so p=13. So that worked. m=25, m=9. Let's see m=16: m-1=15 (p=5), m=16 (p=2), m+1=17 (p=17). So here p(m-1)=5 > p(m)=2, so no. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe look for m where m is a prime power. For example, m=8: m-1=7 (p=7), m=8 (p=2), m+1=9 (p=3). So p(m-1)=7 > p(m)=2, not good.\n\nAlternatively, m=10: m-1=9 (p=3), m=10 (p=5), m+1=11 (p=11). So here p(m-1)=3 < p(m)=5 < p(m+1)=11. So m=10 works. Similarly, m=14: m-1=13 (p=13), m=14 (p=7), m+1=15 (p=5). Here, p(m-1)=13 > p(m)=7, so no.\n\nSo m=10 works. Let's see another example: m=21: m-1=20 (p=5), m=21 (p=7), m+1=22 (p=11). Here, 5 < 7 < 11. So m=21 works. Similarly, m=22: m-1=21 (p=7), m=22 (p=11), m+1=23 (p=23). So 7 < 11 < 23. That works.\n\nSo m=10,21,22,25, etc. These seem to be numbers where m is sandwiched between two numbers with increasing largest prime factors. But how can we ensure there are infinitely many such m?\n\nLooking at the examples, m=10,21,22,25. Let's see:\n\nFor m=10: m+1=11 (prime), so p(m+1)=11. m=10=2*5, p(m)=5. m-1=9=3^2, p=3.\n\nSimilarly, m=21: m+1=22=2*11, p=11. m=21=3*7, p=7. m-1=20=2^2*5, p=5.\n\nm=22: m+1=23 (prime), p=23. m=22=2*11, p=11. m-1=21=3*7, p=7.\n\nm=25: m+1=26=2*13, p=13. m=25=5^2, p=5. m-1=24=2^3*3, p=3.\n\nSo in these cases, m is such that m is a product of primes, and m+1 is either a prime or a product of a small prime and a larger prime. Similarly, m-1 is a product of smaller primes.\n\nBut how to construct infinitely many such m? Maybe by considering m where m is the product of two consecutive primes, and m+1 is the next prime? Wait, for example, m=2*3=6, m+1=7. But m=6: m-1=5 (p=5), m=6 (p=3), m+1=7 (p=7). Here, p(m-1)=5 > p(m)=3, so no good.\n\nAlternatively, m=3*5=15: m-1=14 (p=7), m=15 (p=5), m+1=16 (p=2). Not good.\n\nHmm. Maybe another approach: Let's consider m such that m is a prime minus 1. For example, m=10=11-1, m=22=23-1. Wait, m=10=11-1, where 11 is prime. Then m+1=11, which is prime, so p(m+1)=11. m=10, which factors into 2*5, p=5. m-1=9, p=3. So 3 < 5 < 11. Similarly, m=22=23-1: m+1=23, prime. m=22=2*11, p=11. m-1=21=3*7, p=7. So 7 < 11 < 23. So if we take m = prime - 1, where prime is a prime number, then m+1 is prime, p(m+1)=prime. Then m = prime - 1. Let's see what m would look like. For example, primes are 11,23, etc. Then m=10,22,...\n\nBut then, m=prime -1. The question is whether there are infinitely many primes such that p(m) < prime, where m = prime -1. But m = prime -1, so p(m) is the largest prime factor of prime -1. So we need p(prime -1) < p(m) = p(prime -1) < prime. Wait, but m = prime -1, so p(m) is the largest prime factor of prime -1, which is less than prime (since prime -1 is less than prime, and prime is a prime). So if we take m = prime -1, then p(m) is the largest prime factor of prime -1, which must be less than prime. Then p(m+1) = prime. So for m = prime -1, we have p(m) < p(m+1). Then we also need p(m-1) < p(m). Wait, m-1 = prime -2. So we need the largest prime factor of prime -2 to be less than the largest prime factor of prime -1.\n\nBut how can we ensure that p(prime -2) < p(prime -1)? For example, take prime=11: prime -2=9, p=3; prime -1=10, p=5. 3 < 5. Good. prime=23: prime -2=21, p=7; prime -1=22, p=11. 7 < 11. Good. prime=7: prime -2=5, p=5; prime -1=6, p=3. 5 > 3. Not good. So m=6 would be m=7-1=6, but p(m-1)=5 and p(m)=3, which violates p(m-1) < p(m). So prime=7 doesn't work.\n\nSo primes like 11,23, etc., where prime -1 is composite with a prime factor less than prime, and prime -2 is also composite with a prime factor less than prime -1.\n\nBut how to ensure that there are infinitely many primes where both prime -1 and prime -2 have their largest prime factors less than the largest prime factor of prime -1 and prime respectively.\n\nWait, maybe if we choose primes such that prime -1 is smooth (has only small prime factors), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider primes of the form 2p + 1, where p is also a prime (Sophie Germain primes). For example, prime=11=2*5+1, prime=23=2*11+1, etc. Then prime -1=2p, so p(prime -1)=p. Then m=prime -1=2p. Then p(m)=p. Then m-1=2p -1. If p(m-1) < p. So p(m-1)=p(2p -1). We need p(2p -1) < p. Since 2p -1 is a number less than 2p, and if 2p -1 is prime, then p(m-1)=2p -1, which would be greater than p if p >= 2. For example, p=5: 2p -1=9 (not prime), p(m-1)=3 < 5. For p=11: 2*11 -1=21, which factors into 3*7, so p(m-1)=7 < 11. So if prime=2p +1 where p is a prime, then m=2p, and m-1=2p -1. The largest prime factor of 2p -1 would need to be less than p. If p is a Sophie Germain prime, then 2p +1 is also prime, but I'm not sure if this helps.\n\nWait, in this case, if we take primes of the form 2p +1, then m=2p, and m-1=2p -1. For example, if p=5, then prime=11, m=10, m-1=9=3^2, p=3 < p(m)=5. Then m+1=11, p=11. So works. Similarly, p=11: m=22, m-1=21=3*7, p=7 < p(m)=11. m+1=23, p=23. So this works. If there are infinitely many Sophie Germain primes, then this construction would give infinitely many m. But it's not known if there are infinitely many Sophie Germain primes. So this approach might not be sufficient because we don't know if they are infinite.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find another way that doesn't rely on unproven conjectures.\n\nAnother idea: Consider m where m is a factorial number. For example, m = n! Then m-1 = n! -1 and m+1 = n! +1. The prime factors of n! -1 and n! +1 are typically larger than the primes in n! itself. However, n! has all primes up to n as factors, so p(m) would be n (if n is prime) or less. But n! -1 and n! +1 could have larger prime factors. For example, m=4!: m=24, m-1=23 (prime), m+1=25 (5^2). Here, p(m-1)=23 > p(m)=3 (since 24=2^3*3) and p(m+1)=5. So not good. Similarly, m=5!: m=120, m-1=119=7*17, p=17; m=120=2^3*3*5, p=5; m+1=121=11^2, p=11. So p(m-1)=17 > p(m)=5. Not good.\n\nSo factorial numbers don't seem to help.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's look for m such that m is a multiple of some prime q, and m+1 is a prime larger than q, and m-1 has all prime factors less than q. If we can find such m for infinitely many q, then we can get infinitely many m.\n\nFor example, take q=5. Then m=10, which is a multiple of 5. m+1=11 (prime >5), m-1=9=3^2 (primes <5). Works. Similarly, q=7: m=21=3*7. m+1=22=2*11. p(m+1)=11>7. m-1=20=2^2*5. p=5<7. So works. Similarly, q=11: m=22=2*11. m+1=23>11. m-1=21=3*7<11. Works. So if for each prime q, we can find m such that m is a multiple of q, m+1 is a prime > q, and m-1 has all prime factors < q, then we can have infinitely many m.\n\nBut how to ensure that for each prime q, there exists such an m. For example, given a prime q, can we find a multiple of q such that m+1 is prime and m-1 has factors less than q. Let's see.\n\nTake m = k*q. Then m+1 = k*q +1. We need k*q +1 to be prime. Also, m-1 = k*q -1. We need p(k*q -1) < q. So for each prime q, we need to find a k such that k*q +1 is prime and k*q -1 has all prime factors less than q.\n\nThis seems non-trivial, but perhaps for k=1, m=q. Then m+1 = q+1, which is not prime unless q=2 (since q is prime, q+1 would be even if q is odd). For q=2: m=2, m+1=3 (prime). m-1=1, which has no prime factors. So p(m-1) is undefined. So not useful.\n\nFor q=3: k=2: m=6. m+1=7 (prime). m-1=5 (prime). p(m-1)=5 > q=3. Not good.\n\nk=1: m=3. m+1=4 (not prime). So no.\n\nk=3: m=9. m+1=10 (not prime). No.\n\nk=4: m=12. m+1=13 (prime). m-1=11 (prime). p(m-1)=11 > q=3. No good.\n\nq=5: k=2: m=10. m+1=11 (prime). m-1=9=3^2. p=3 <5. Good. So works.\n\nq=5: k=3: m=15. m+1=16 (not prime). No.\n\nk=4: m=20. m+1=21 (not prime). No.\n\nq=7: k=3: m=21. m+1=22 (not prime). No.\n\nk=2: m=14. m+1=15 (not prime). No.\n\nk=5: m=35. m+1=36 (not prime). No.\n\nWait, earlier we had m=21, which is 3*7. m+1=22=2*11. p(m+1)=11>7. m-1=20=2^2*5. p=5<7. So here, q=7, k=3: m=21. m+1=22 is not prime, but p(m+1)=11>7. So maybe m+1 doesn't need to be prime, just needs to have a prime factor larger than q.\n\nSo perhaps the condition is: For prime q, find m = k*q such that p(m+1) > q and p(m-1) < q. If we can do this for infinitely many primes q, then since each q gives at least one m, and primes are infinite, we get infinitely many m.\n\nBut how to ensure that for each prime q, there exists a multiple k*q such that m+1 has a prime factor larger than q and m-1 has all prime factors less than q.\n\nFor m+1: m+1 = k*q +1. We need this number to have a prime factor larger than q. Similarly, m-1 = k*q -1, which needs to have all prime factors less than q.\n\nThis is similar to the idea in Dirichlet's theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions. If we can choose k such that k*q -1 is composed of primes less than q, and k*q +1 has a prime factor greater than q.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for q, choose m = q^2. Then m-1 = q^2 -1 = (q-1)(q+1). The prime factors of (q-1) and (q+1). If q is a prime greater than 3, then q-1 and q+1 are even, so they have factors 2 and other primes. For example, q=5: m=25. m-1=24=2^3*3. p=3 <5. m=25, p=5. m+1=26=2*13. p=13>5. Works.\n\nq=7: m=49. m-1=48=2^4*3. p=3 <7. m=49, p=7. m+1=50=2*5^2. p=5 <7. Doesn't work. Hmm.\n\nWait, m=49: m+1=50, p=5 <7. So this doesn't work. So m=49 doesn't satisfy the condition.\n\nAlternatively, m= q*(q+2). For example, q=3: m=3*5=15. m-1=14=2*7, p=7 >3. Not good. q=5: m=5*7=35. m-1=34=2*17, p=17>5. Not good.\n\nHmm. Another approach: For each prime q, set m = 2*q. Then m-1=2q -1. We need p(2q -1) < q. And m+1=2q +1, which needs to have p(m+1) > q.\n\nFor example, q=5: m=10. m-1=9=3^2 <5. m+1=11>5. Good.\n\nq=7: m=14. m-1=13 (prime) >7. Doesn't work.\n\nq=11: m=22. m-1=21=3*7 <11. m+1=23>11. Good.\n\nq=13: m=26. m-1=25=5^2 <13. m+1=27=3^3. p=3 <13. Doesn't work.\n\nSo for q=7 and q=13, this approach fails. But for q=5,11, it works. So maybe there are infinitely many primes q where 2q -1 has all prime factors less than q, and 2q +1 is prime or has a prime factor greater than q.\n\nThis seems related to twin primes or primes in certain sequences. If there are infinitely many primes q such that 2q +1 is also prime (which are Sophie Germain primes again), then m=2q would work, provided that 2q -1 factors into primes less than q.\n\nWait, for q=5: 2q +1=11 (prime), and 2q -1=9=3^2, primes 3<5. Similarly, q=11: 2q +1=23 (prime), 2q -1=21=3*7, both primes <11.\n\nFor q=23: m=46. m-1=45=3^2*5, primes <23. m+1=47 (prime>23). So works.\n\nSo if there are infinitely many primes q such that 2q +1 is prime (Sophie Germain primes), then we can construct infinitely many m=2q. But as before, it's not known if there are infinitely many Sophie Germain primes.\n\nHowever, the problem only asks to show that there exist infinitely many m, not necessarily to construct them explicitly. So perhaps we can use a density argument or show that the set of such m is infinite by some other means.\n\nAnother approach: Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem or some combinatorial argument to show that there are infinitely many m such that m-1, m, m+1 have prime factors with the required inequalities.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the primes are infinite, and for each sufficiently large prime p, we can find m such that p divides m, and m+1 has a prime factor larger than p, and m-1 has all prime factors less than p. If we can do this for infinitely many p, then we're done.\n\nSuppose we take m = p. Then m+1 = p+1, which is even, so its largest prime factor is at most (p+1)/2. For p >2, (p+1)/2 < p, so p(m+1) < p. So this doesn't work. But if we take m = kp such that m+1 is a multiple of a larger prime. For example, m = p*q where q is a prime larger than p. Then m+1 = p*q +1. If we can choose q such that p*q +1 has a prime factor larger than p*q's largest prime factor (which is q). But this seems complicated.\n\nWait, let's think probabilistically. For a random large m, the prime factors of m-1, m, m+1 are somewhat random. The probability that p(m-1) < p(m) < p(m+1) should be positive, so heuristically, there should be infinitely many such m. But we need a rigorous proof.\n\nPerhaps use the concept of smooth numbers. A number is called y-smooth if all its prime factors are less than or equal to y. So if we can find m such that m-1 is smooth (say, all prime factors ≤ y), m is a prime greater than y, and m+1 has a prime factor greater than y. Then if we can do this for infinitely many y, we get infinitely many m.\n\nBut how to ensure this? Suppose we take y as a parameter going to infinity. For each y, we need to find a prime m such that m-1 is y-smooth and m+1 has a prime factor > y.\n\nThis is similar to finding primes m such that m-1 is smooth and m+1 is rough (has a large prime factor). The existence of such primes for infinitely many y would imply the result.\n\nBut proving that such primes exist for arbitrarily large y is non-trivial. It might relate to the distribution of primes in arithmetic progressions or other advanced number theory topics.\n\nAlternatively, consider the following construction inspired by Euclid's proof of infinitely many primes. Suppose we have a finite set of primes {p_1, p_2, ..., p_n}. Let P be their product. Consider m = P + 1. Then m-1 = P, so p(m-1) is the largest among p_i. m = P +1, which is either prime or has a prime factor not in the original set. Similarly, m+1 = P +2, which may have prime factors not in the original set. However, this approach might not directly help, but maybe a similar idea can be used.\n\nWait, suppose we take m = k! + 1. Then m-1 = k!, which has all prime factors ≤k. So p(m-1) ≤k. m = k! +1, which could be prime or have a prime factor >k. If m is prime, then p(m)=m >k. m+1 =k! +2, which has prime factors. If we can ensure p(m+1) > p(m), but this might not hold. For example, k=5: m=121, which is not prime (121=11^2). p(m)=11. m+1=122=2*61. p=61>11. So p(m-1)=5 (from 120=5!), p(m)=11, p(m+1)=61. So 5 <11 <61. So m=121 works. Similarly, k=6: m=721=7*103, p=103. m-1=720=6!, p=5 <103. m+1=722=2*19*19. p=19 <103. So here p(m+1)=19 <103, so doesn't work.\n\nHmm. So m=121 works, m=721 doesn't. So some factorial-based m work, others don't. But if we can take m to be prime, like m= k! +1 where it's prime, then p(m)=m, and p(m+1) would need to be greater than m. But m+1 =k! +2. For example, if m=3! +1=7 (prime). m+1=8, p=2 <7. Doesn't work. m=5! +1=121 (not prime). m=11! +1 is prime? I don't know, but even if it is, m+1=11! +2, which factors into primes greater than 11? Not necessarily. It could have small prime factors. For example, 11! +2 is divisible by 2, since 11! is even. So p(m+1)=something else, but 11! +2/2 = (11!)/2 +1, which might be prime or not. In any case, this approach doesn't guarantee that p(m+1) > p(m).\n\nBut in the case where m is prime and m= k! +1, then p(m)=m, but m+1= k! +2, which is even, so p(m+1)=2 < m. So this doesn't help.\n\nAnother idea: Use the theorem that there are infinitely many primes congruent to 1 mod 4, or other congruence classes. But not sure how to apply that here.\n\nWait, perhaps use the fact that there are infinitely many primes, and for each prime p, look at numbers around p. For example, take m=p. Then m-1=p-1, m=p, m+1=p+1. We need p(p-1) < p < p(p+1). But p(p+1) is the largest prime factor of p+1. If p+1 is composite, then p(p+1) could be less than or greater than p. For example, p=5: m=5, m+1=6, p=3 <5. Doesn't work. p=7: m+1=8, p=2 <7. Doesn't work. p=11: m+1=12, p=3 <11. Doesn't work. So this approach doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, take m=p+1. Then m-1=p, which is prime. m=p+1. m+1=p+2. So we need p(p)=p < p(p+1) and p(p+1) < p(p+2). But p(p+1) is the largest prime factor of p+1. For example, m=6: p=5. p(m-1)=5, p(m)=3, p(m+1)=7. So 5 >3 <7. Doesn't satisfy the chain.\n\nAnother angle: Consider triples of consecutive numbers where each has a larger prime factor. Perhaps use the fact that in any three consecutive numbers, one is even, but that's too vague.\n\nWait, let's think about the original problem again. We need to show there are infinitely many m where p(m-1) < p(m) < p(m+1). Suppose we can show that for infinitely many primes q, there exists m such that p(m)=q, and p(m-1) < q and p(m+1) > q. If we can do this, then since there are infinitely many primes, we'd have infinitely many m.\n\nTo do this, fix a prime q. We need to find m such that q is the largest prime factor of m, m-1 has all prime factors less than q, and m+1 has a prime factor larger than q.\n\nTake m=q. Then m+1=q+1. If q+1 has a prime factor larger than q, it must be prime itself. So q+1 is prime, meaning q is a twin prime. But twin primes are conjectured to be infinite, not proven. So this approach might not work.\n\nAlternatively, take m=2q. Then m=2q, p(m)=q (if q is the largest prime factor). m-1=2q-1. Need p(2q -1) < q. m+1=2q +1. Need p(2q +1) > q. For example, if 2q +1 is prime, then p(m+1)=2q +1 > q. Also, 2q -1 factors into primes less than q. If this holds for infinitely many q, then we're done.\n\nBut as before, this requires that for infinitely many primes q, 2q +1 is also prime (Sophie Germain primes), and 2q -1 factors into primes less than q. Since Sophie Germain primes are infinite (conjectured but not proven), we can't use this for a proof.\n\nBut perhaps we don't need to restrict to m=2q. Maybe there are other forms of m that can achieve this for arbitrary primes q.\n\nSuppose we let m be the product of all primes up to q. Then m is the primorial of q, denoted q#. Then m-1 = q# -1, which is coprime to all primes up to q, so its prime factors are all greater than q. Thus, p(m-1) > q, which is not what we want.\n\nSimilarly, m+1 = q# +1, which is also coprime to all primes up to q, so its prime factors are greater than q. So p(m+1) > q, but p(m-1) > q as well. So this doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, let m be a number that is q-smooth (all prime factors ≤q), but m itself has largest prime factor q. Then m-1 must not be divisible by any prime >q, but since m is divisible by q, m-1 is congruent to -1 mod q, so not divisible by q. Similarly, m+1 is congruent to 1 mod q. However, m+1 could have prime factors larger than q. If we can choose m such that m+1 has a prime factor larger than q and m-1 is q-smooth.\n\nFor example, take q=5. m=20=2^2*5. m-1=19 (prime >5). Doesn't work. m=15=3*5. m-1=14=2*7. p=7>5. Doesn't work. m=10=2*5. m-1=9=3^2 <5. m+1=11>5. Works. So m=10 works. Similarly, m=20: m+1=21=3*7. p=7>5. m-1=19>5. Doesn't work. But m=10 works.\n\nSo maybe for each prime q, there exists a multiple of q where m-1 is q-smooth and m+1 has a prime factor >q. For example, m=2*q. Then m-1=2q -1. We need p(2q -1) < q and p(2q +1) > q. As before, this relies on properties of primes.\n\nBut unless we can find a way to show that for infinitely many q, such m exist without relying on unproven conjectures, we need another method.\n\nPerhaps use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. For example, construct m such that m ≡0 mod q (so q divides m), m ≡1 mod p for all primes p < q (so m-1 is divisible by all primes less than q, hence m-1 is smooth with primes <q). Then m+1 would be 2 mod q and 2 mod p for p <q. Wait, no. If m ≡0 mod q, then m+1 ≡1 mod q. If we set m ≡0 mod q and m ≡1 mod p for all primes p <q, then m-1 ≡-1 mod p for all p <q, and m-1 ≡-1 mod q. So m-1 would be congruent to -1 mod all primes p ≤q. This implies that m-1 is coprime to all primes p ≤q, so m-1 must be a prime itself or have prime factors all greater than q. But we want m-1 to have prime factors less than q. This approach seems contradictory.\n\nAlternatively, to make m-1 divisible by all primes less than q, set m ≡1 mod p for all p <q. Then m-1 is divisible by all primes p <q. So m-1 is divisible by all primes less than q, hence p(m-1) ≤ max{p | p <q} = the largest prime less than q. Then m is divisible by q, so p(m) = q. m+1 is congruent to 2 mod q and to 2 mod p for all p <q. So m+1 could be divisible by primes greater than q. If we can ensure that m+1 has a prime factor greater than q, then we satisfy the conditions.\n\nBut how to ensure that such an m exists. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there exists a solution to the system:\n\nm ≡0 mod q,\n\nm ≡1 mod p for all primes p <q.\n\nThis system has a solution since all the moduli are pairwise coprime (q is a prime greater than all p <q). Let m be the smallest such solution. Then m-1 is divisible by all primes less than q, so p(m-1) ≤ the largest prime less than q, which is <q. m is divisible by q, so p(m)=q. m+1 is congruent to 2 mod q and to 2 mod p for all p <q. So m+1 is not divisible by any prime ≤q, hence all its prime factors are >q. Therefore, p(m+1) >q. Therefore, for this m, we have p(m-1) < p(m) < p(m+1).\n\nSince q can be any prime, and for each prime q we can construct such an m, there are infinitely many such m. Thus, the proof is complete.\n\nThis seems to work. The key idea is that for any prime q, using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we can find an m that is divisible by q, congruent to 1 modulo all smaller primes, ensuring that m-1 is divisible by all primes less than q, hence its largest prime factor is less than q. Then m+1 is congruent to 2 modulo q and to 2 modulo all primes less than q, so it's not divisible by any of them, meaning its prime factors are all greater than q. Therefore, p(m+1) >q = p(m). Since there are infinitely many primes q, this construction gives infinitely many m satisfying the condition.",
