I assume that even unbounded face should be a triangle. I just don't see.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is asking about two parts related to planar graphs, specifically triangulations. \n\nFirst, they need to prove that in every triangulation, there exists an edge {u, v} such that the sum of the degrees of u and v is at most 22. The second part is to provide an example of a planar graph without vertices of degree 1 that doesn't have such an edge. \n\nThe user mentions that the problem seems hard, especially with the limit of 22. They also note that they covered classic topics like the four-color theorem, Euler's formula, Kuratowski's theorem, etc., but find this problem challenging. \n\nLooking at the original problem statement, the user might have included some extraneous information, like their personal thoughts on the difficulty, which we should filter out. The key parts are the two bullet points: the proof and the example. \n\nFor the assumptions, in the first part, the problem is about a triangulation, which is a planar graph where every face (including the unbounded face, if applicable) is a triangle. So the assumptions should include that the graph is a triangulation (planar, every face is a triangle). The problem is to show there's an edge with degree sum ≤22. \n\nFor the second part, the example should be a planar graph without vertices of degree 1, which does not have any edge with degree sum ≤22. But wait, the second part says \"doesn't have such edge\", meaning that all edges have degree sums >22. But the example needs to be a planar graph without degree 1 vertices. However, the original problem's second part says \"give an example of planar graph without vertex of degree equal to 1, which doesn't have such edge.\" So the assumptions here would be that the graph is planar, has no vertices of degree 1, and every edge {u, v} has deg(u) + deg(v) >22.\n\nBut wait, the first part is about triangulations, and the second part is about a planar graph (not necessarily a triangulation) without degree 1 vertices that lacks such an edge. So the second part's example isn't a triangulation, because if it were a triangulation, by the first part's result, it would have such an edge. Therefore, the example must be a planar graph that is not a triangulation, has no degree 1 vertices, and all edges have degree sums exceeding 22.\n\nBut in structuring the problem, the user needs to separate the two parts. The first part is about triangulations, the second about planar graphs (not necessarily triangulations) with no degree 1 vertices. So when formatting, each part would be a separate problem? Wait, the original problem has two bullet points. So maybe the entire problem is two parts under the same problem statement. However, in the example provided by the user, the formatted problem only has one problem statement. So perhaps we need to structure this as two separate problems?\n\nWait, looking back at the user's example, the original problem was a single statement to prove, but in this case, the problem has two parts. However, the user's instruction says to structure \"the problem\" into the given format. Since the original problem has two parts, perhaps they should be split into two separate problems in the formatted output. Let me check the example again. The example had a single problem. So maybe the user wants each part as a separate problem. But the original problem is presented as one question with two parts. The user's example only had one problem. So perhaps the answer should structure each bullet as a separate problem with their own assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, the problem may be considered as two separate problems, each with their own assumptions. Let me try to parse it.\n\nFirst bullet: Prove that in every triangulation exists edge {u,v} such that deg(u) + deg(v) ≤22.\n\nAssumptions here would be: The graph is a planar graph, every face is a triangle (i.e., it's a triangulation). The problem is to show such an edge exists.\n\nSecond bullet: Give an example of a planar graph without vertices of degree 1 that doesn't have such an edge.\n\nAssumptions here: The graph is planar, no vertex has degree 1, and for every edge {u,v}, deg(u) + deg(v) >22.\n\nTherefore, in the formatted problem, we need to present each part as a separate problem with their own assumptions. But the user's example only includes one problem. However, the original problem here has two parts. So perhaps the answer should be structured as two separate problems. But looking back at the user's instructions, they provided an example where the original problem was a single question, and the formatted problem was a single problem. So perhaps the user wants the two bullet points as two separate problems. Let me check the instructions again.\n\nThe user says: \"structure that problem as the following format\" and provides an example where the original problem was a single proof question. Here, the original problem has two parts. So maybe each part is a separate problem in the formatted output. Therefore, the answer should have two entries under the ###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###.\n\nBut the user's example only had one problem. Hmm. Maybe the user wants each part of the problem to be structured separately. Let me think. The user's instruction says \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" So perhaps the two bullet points are two separate problems, each with their own assumptions. So the formatted output would have two \"Assumption: ... Problem: ...\" sections. Alternatively, maybe they are two parts of one problem. But the example given by the user only had one problem. However, since the original problem has two distinct parts, maybe each should be a separate problem. Let me check the user's example again. In their example, the original problem had a single statement, so it became one problem. Here, the original problem has two bullets, so perhaps each bullet is a separate problem. But the user's example didn't have multiple problems. So perhaps the answer should present both parts as two separate problems. Let me check the user's example again.\n\nOriginal example:\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\nProblem: Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nBut in the example, the original problem didn't mention that n is divisible by 7. The formatted problem added that as an assumption. Wait, but in reality, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption in the example seems incorrect. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in their example. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they have an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Maybe the example is incorrect, or maybe the user intended to show how to filter assumptions. Wait, perhaps the example is a wrong example. Because if the original problem is to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91, then the assumption should not include that n is divisible by 7. Because the original statement is for all integers n. Therefore, the example might have a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to present a different scenario where the problem was to prove divisibility by 91 under the assumption that n is divisible by 7, but that's not the case here. Therefore, the example might be flawed. But regardless, moving forward.\n\nIn the current problem, the user presents two bullet points. So perhaps the formatted problem should have two separate entries, each with their own assumptions and problem statements. However, the user's example only shows one problem. So maybe the user wants both parts to be in the same problem. But the example's original problem was a single statement. So perhaps here, since the problem has two parts, we need to combine them into one problem with two parts. But the format requires \"Assumption\" and \"Problem\". So perhaps the problem statement includes both parts, and the assumptions for each part are listed. But the original problem's first part is about triangulations, and the second part is about planar graphs (not necessarily triangulations) with no degree 1 vertices. Therefore, each part has different assumptions. Hence, we need to structure each bullet as a separate problem.\n\nTherefore, the formatted output would have two entries:\n\nFirst problem:\n\nAssumption: The graph is a planar graph (triangulation), every face is a triangle.\n\nProblem: Prove that in every such triangulation there exists an edge {u, v} such that deg(u) + deg(v) ≤ 22.\n\nSecond problem:\n\nAssumption: The graph is planar, no vertex has degree 1, every edge {u, v} satisfies deg(u) + deg(v) > 22.\n\nProblem: Give an example of such a graph.\n\nBut wait, the second part is to \"give an example of planar graph without vertex of degree equal to 1, which doesn't have such edge.\" So the problem is to construct such a graph. Therefore, the assumptions would be: the graph is planar, it has no vertices of degree 1, and for every edge {u, v}, deg(u) + deg(v) > 22. But the problem is to provide an example. Therefore, the problem statement would be: Give an example of a planar graph with no vertices of degree 1 that does not have any edge {u, v} with deg(u) + deg(v) ≤ 22.\n\nBut in the formatted problem, the assumptions are the given conditions, and the problem is the task. Therefore, for the second part:\n\nAssumptions: The graph is planar, no vertex has degree 1.\n\nProblem: Give an example of such a graph where every edge {u, v} satisfies deg(u) + deg(v) > 22.\n\nBut the problem statement is to give an example of a planar graph without degree 1 vertices that doesn't have such an edge (i.e., all edges have sum >22). So the assumptions are the planar and no degree 1 vertices, and the problem is to provide an example where all edges have sum >22.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem for the second part would be:\n\nAssumption: The graph is planar, the graph has no vertices of degree 1.\n\nProblem: Give an example of such a graph that does not have any edge $\\{u, v\\}$ with $\\deg(u) + \\deg(v) \\le 22$.\n\nSo putting it all together, the two parts are separate problems. However, the user's example only had one problem. But given that the original problem has two distinct parts, each with different assumptions, they should be formatted as two separate problems. But the user's instructions don't specify handling multiple parts. Given that, perhaps the user expects both parts to be included in a single problem. Alternatively, maybe they should be split. But given that the example had one problem, perhaps the answer should have two problems. Let me check the user's instructions again.\n\nThe user says: \"structure that problem as the following format\" and \"You will be given some example which I structured before.\" So in the example, the original problem was a single question, and the formatted problem was a single entry. Therefore, for the current problem, which has two parts, perhaps the answer should have two formatted entries. But since the user's example didn't handle multiple parts, maybe the answer should include both parts as separate entries. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considered as one problem with two parts, but the format only allows one problem. This is unclear. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first part is the main problem, and the second part is an additional question. But the user's example didn't have that. So maybe the answer should have two separate formatted entries. Therefore, the final answer would be:\n\nFirst part:\n\nAssumption: The graph is a triangulation (planar graph where every face is a triangle).\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists an edge $\\{u, v\\}$ such that $\\deg(u) + \\deg(v) \\le 22$.\n\nSecond part:\n\nAssumption: The graph is planar, the graph has no vertices of degree 1.\n\nProblem: Give an example of such a graph that does not have any edge $\\{u, v\\}$ with $\\deg(u) + \\deg(v) \\le 22$.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is considered as a single problem with two parts, but the format requires separate assumptions and problem, perhaps the assumptions include both parts. But that's not feasible. Therefore, it's better to present each bullet as a separate problem.\n\nThus, the formatted answer would be two separate entries under the same BEGIN_OF_FORMAT section. However, looking at the user's example, they have one Assumption and one Problem. Therefore, perhaps the answer should have two separate entries, each with their own Assumption and Problem. However, the user's instructions might expect a single problem. But given that the original problem has two distinct parts, it's more accurate to split them. However, the user's example shows that the original problem is a single statement, which is formatted into one problem. Therefore, perhaps the answer should have two separate formatted problems. However, the user might expect to have both parts in one. \n\nBut given the ambiguity, perhaps the safest way is to follow the user's example and present each part as a separate problem. Therefore, the answer would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nThe graph is a triangulation (planar graph where every face is a triangle).\nProblem: \nProve that there exists an edge $\\{u, v\\}$ such that $\\deg(u) + \\deg(v) \\le 22$.\n###\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nThe graph is planar,\nThe graph has no vertices of degree 1.\nProblem: \nGive an example of a planar graph without vertices of degree 1 that does not have any edge $\\{u, v\\}$ with $\\deg(u) + \\deg(v) \\le 22$.\n###\n\nBut the user's example didn't use multiple BEGIN_OF_FORMAT blocks. The user's example only had one. Therefore, perhaps the answer should combine both parts into one problem. But each part has different assumptions and different problems. This complicates things. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considered as a single problem with two parts, but the format doesn't support that. Therefore, the answer might have to present them as two separate problems, each with their own Assumption and Problem sections. However, since the user's example only had one, maybe the user expects one, but given the original problem has two parts, perhaps the answer should include both. The user's example may not have considered multiple parts. In any case, given the ambiguity, I'll proceed by structuring each bullet as a separate problem with their own assumptions and problem statements.",
