This means that we are saying that $$\\tan A+\\tan B+\\tan C=\\tan A\\tan B\\tan C$$ Consider $\\tan (A+B+C)$ : $$\\tan (A+B+C)=\\frac{\\tan A+\\tan B+\\tan C-\\tan A\\tan B\\tan C}{1- \\tan A \\tan B- \\tan C \\tan A - \\tan B \\tan C}$$ So if $~\\tan A+\\tan B+\\tan C=\\tan A\\tan B\\tan C~~$ then $~~\\tan (A+B+C)=0$ . Hence, let $~A+B+C=\\pi$ . Now consider $\\tan (2A+2B+2C)$ : $$\\tan (2A+2B+2C)=\\frac{\\tan 2A+\\tan 2B+\\tan 2C-\\tan 2A\\tan 2B\\tan 2C}{1- \\tan 2A \\tan 2B- \\tan 2C \\tan 2A - \\tan 2B \\tan 2C}=0$$ $$\\implies \\tan 2A+\\tan 2B+\\tan 2C=\\tan 2A\\tan 2B\\tan 2C$$ $$\\implies \\frac{2\\tan A}{1-\\tan^2 A}+\\frac{2\\tan B}{1-\\tan^2 B}+\\frac{2\\tan C}{1-\\tan^2 C}=\\frac{2\\tan A}{1-\\tan^2 A}\\times\\frac{2\\tan B}{1-\\tan^2 B}\\times\\frac{2\\tan C}{1-\\tan^2 C}$$ $$\\therefore\\frac{2x}{1-x^2}+\\frac{2y}{1-y^2}+\\frac{2z}{1-z^2}=\\frac{2x}{1-x^2}\\times\\frac{2y}{1-y^2}\\times\\frac{2z}{1-z^2}$$ as required. My question is, is there any other way of proving this without this rather heavy use of trigonometry? I also would prefer not to work through heaps of algabraic manipulation and expansion to obtain the required result, although if that's necessary I will put up with it ;) Thank you for your help.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Define a new operation $p \\otimes q = \\frac{{p + q}}{{1 - pq}}$ . And it's easy to find that it's associative. $p \\otimes q \\otimes r = \\frac{{p + q + r - pqr}}{{1 - pq - pr - qr}}$ . It means $p + q + r = pqr \\Leftrightarrow p \\otimes q \\otimes r = 0$ . And then $\\begin{array}{l}\n\\frac{{2x}}{{1 - {x^2}}} \\times \\frac{{2y}}{{1 - {y^2}}} \\times \\frac{{2z}}{{1 - {z^2}}} - (\\frac{{2x}}{{1 - {x^2}}} + \\frac{{2y}}{{1 - {y^2}}} + \\frac{{2z}}{{1 - {z^2}}}) = 0\\\\\n \\Leftrightarrow \\frac{{2x}}{{1 - {x^2}}} \\otimes \\frac{{2y}}{{1 - {y^2}}} \\otimes \\frac{{2z}}{{1 - {z^2}}} = 0\\\\\n \\Leftrightarrow (x \\otimes x) \\otimes (y \\otimes y) \\otimes (z \\otimes z) = 0\\\\\n \\Leftrightarrow (x \\otimes y \\otimes z) \\otimes (x \\otimes y \\otimes z) = 0\\\\\n \\Leftrightarrow 0 \\otimes 0 = 0\n\\end{array}$ So the problem is solved.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The problem is to prove that if x + y + z = xyz, then (2x)/(1 - x²) + (2y)/(1 - y²) + (2z)/(1 - z²) equals the product of those three fractions. The original solution used trigonometric substitutions by letting x = tan A, y = tan B, z = tan C, then using properties of tangent addition formulas. The user wants an alternative proof without heavy trigonometry and minimal algebraic manipulation.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the given conditions and the problem statement correctly. The assumptions here are that x, y, z are real numbers such that x + y + z = xyz, and also that x² ≠ 1, y² ≠ 1, z² ≠ 1. The problem is to prove the equation involving those fractions.\n\nSo, in the Assumption section, each line should list one condition applied to one object. That would be:\n\n- x, y, z are real numbers.\n- x + y + z = xyz.\n- x² ≠ 1.\n- y² ≠ 1.\n- z² ≠ 1.\n\nBut wait, the original problem statement mentions \"given that x², y², z² ≠ 1\". So maybe each of these is a separate assumption. So each x² ≠ 1, y² ≠ 1, z² ≠ 1 on separate lines.\n\nThe problem is then to prove the equality of the sum and product of those three terms.\n\nNow, the user's example had the original problem, then the formatted version. The example had the assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for all integers n. But in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, looking back, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, the expression is divisible by 91. The user formatted it as assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like a mistake. Because the original problem didn't have the assumption that n is divisible by 7; it's supposed to hold for every integer n. So maybe the example was incorrect. But perhaps the user's example was a different problem. Wait, maybe the example given was a different problem. Let me check again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in their example. But regardless, the user now wants to structure the current problem according to their format, which for the example, broke down the assumptions into each line. So for the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. x, y, z are real numbers.\n2. x + y + z = xyz.\n3. x² ≠ 1.\n4. y² ≠ 1.\n5. z² ≠ 1.\n\nBut the original problem states \"given that x², y², z² ≠ 1\", so each is a separate assumption. Also, the problem is to prove the equation. So in the Problem section, it's the equation given.\n\nBut let me check the original problem again. The user's question on Math Stack Exchange is titled: If x + y + z = xyz, prove [the equation] given that x², y², z² ≠ 1. So the key assumptions are the equation x + y + z = xyz and that x², y², z² are not equal to 1. So each of these should be separate assumptions. Also, x, y, z are variables here; we can assume they are real numbers unless specified otherwise, but maybe the problem doesn't specify, but the original solution uses trigonometric substitution, which might imply real numbers. But the problem may not specify, but perhaps the user is working in real numbers. But if the problem doesn't specify, perhaps we shouldn't assume unless necessary. Hmm. Wait, the original problem just gives x + y + z = xyz and x², y², z² ≠ 1. So perhaps the variables are real numbers, but maybe complex. But since the trigonometric substitution is used, likely real numbers. But the problem may not specify. However, the original solution uses tan A, which is real. So perhaps the assumption is that x, y, z are real numbers such that x² ≠ 1, etc. But the problem statement as given doesn't explicitly state that x, y, z are real, but since the original solution uses real substitutions, maybe we need to include that. However, the problem as presented in the title and question doesn't specify. So maybe we can't assume they are real unless stated. But in the original question, the user mentions \"an ancient Trigonometry book\", which would imply real numbers. But strictly speaking, the problem as stated doesn't specify. Hmm. However, in the formatted example, the assumption was that n is an integer, which wasn't stated in the problem but was part of the problem's quantifier (\"for every integer n\"). So perhaps in this problem, the variables are real numbers with x², y², z² ≠ 1 and x + y + z = xyz. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- x, y, z are real numbers.\n- x + y + z = xyz.\n- x² ≠ 1.\n- y² ≠ 1.\n- z² ≠ 1.\n\nBut wait, in the original problem statement, the user wrote \"given that x², y², z² ≠1\". So maybe the problem's assumptions are:\n\n- x + y + z = xyz.\n- x² ≠ 1.\n- y² ≠ 1.\n- z² ≠ 1.\n\nBut the fact that x, y, z are real numbers is not stated in the problem. However, if the original solution uses tan A, tan B, tan C, which are real, perhaps the problem is in the context of real numbers. But the problem may not explicitly state that. However, the user might have included that in their original problem as part of the context, but the title and question don't mention it. Hmm. Let's check the original problem again.\n\nThe original problem's title is: If x + y + z = xyz, prove the equation given that x², y², z² ≠1. The question body says: \"given that x², y², z² ≠1\". So the assumptions are x + y + z = xyz and x², y², z² ≠1. The variables x, y, z are probably real numbers, but the problem doesn't specify. However, in mathematics, unless stated otherwise, variables are assumed to be in the real numbers unless otherwise noted. But maybe the problem allows complex numbers? However, the original trigonometric substitution would only work for real numbers (excluding singularities). So perhaps the problem is intended for real numbers. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- x, y, z are real numbers.\n- x + y + z = xyz.\n- x² ≠ 1.\n- y² ≠ 1.\n- z² ≠ 1.\n\nBut does the problem explicitly state that x, y, z are real? The problem statement given in the user's question says \"given that x², y², z² ≠1\", but doesn't specify real numbers. However, in the original solution, they set x = tan A, which is real. Therefore, perhaps the problem is in the context of real numbers. Therefore, including that as an assumption.\n\nBut wait, the user's formatted example included assumptions that were not explicitly in the problem. In the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted assumption included \"n is an integer\", which is part of the problem's quantifier, and \"n is divisible by 7\", which was not in the original problem. Wait, that seems like an error. Wait, in the original example, the problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. So the formatted problem in the example lists assumptions as n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that's incorrect because the original problem didn't require n to be divisible by 7. It required it for all integers n. So perhaps the example was incorrect, but the user provided it as their own example. Therefore, maybe in their format, they want to include all conditions, including those that are part of the problem's quantifiers. So for the current problem, the quantifier is \"If x + y + z = xyz, prove...\", so the assumptions are x + y + z = xyz, and x² ≠1, etc. Additionally, perhaps variables are real numbers. But since the problem didn't specify, maybe we can't include that unless it's implied. Alternatively, maybe the problem allows complex numbers. But given the original solution uses trigonometric substitution, it's likely intended for real numbers. However, the problem as stated doesn't specify. Therefore, maybe we should not include \"x, y, z are real numbers\" as an assumption unless it's given. But in the original problem statement, the user mentions \"given that x², y², z² ≠1\", which is part of the problem's given conditions. The equation x + y + z = xyz is another condition. So the assumptions should be:\n\n- x + y + z = xyz.\n- x² ≠ 1.\n- y² ≠ 1.\n- z² ≠ 1.\n\nEven if x, y, z are complex numbers, those conditions still make sense. But the problem is likely intended for real numbers given the trigonometric approach. However, since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps we shouldn't include the real numbers as an assumption unless it's given. Therefore, the assumptions are the four listed above. But wait, each assumption addresses only one property or condition applied to one object. So x + y + z = xyz is a single condition involving all three variables, which may be against the format's requirement of each assumption addressing one object. However, in the example given, the assumption was \"n is an integer\", \"n is divisible by 7\", which are two separate conditions on n. Similarly, here, x + y + z = xyz is a single condition involving multiple variables, but perhaps in the format, that's acceptable as one assumption line. Then the other assumptions are x² ≠1, y² ≠1, z² ≠1, each on separate lines. Therefore, the formatted assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nx + y + z = xyz,\nx² ≠ 1,\ny² ≠ 1,\nz² ≠ 1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\frac{2x}{1 - x^2} + \\frac{2y}{1 - y^2} + \\frac{2z}{1 - z^2} = \\frac{2x}{1 - x^2} \\times \\frac{2y}{1 - y^2} \\times \\frac{2z}{1 - z^2}.$$\n\nYes, that seems to fit. Each assumption line is a separate condition. The first line is the equation relating x, y, z. The next three lines are the conditions that each variable's square is not 1. The problem is to prove the equality. Therefore, this should be the correct formatting.",
