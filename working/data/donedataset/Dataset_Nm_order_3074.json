    "Content": "Let $f(t,z):[a,b] \\times D \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}$ , $D \\subseteq \\mathbb{C}$ open, a continuous function analytic in $D$ for all $t \\in [a,b]$ . Also, $\\frac{\\partial f }{\\partial z} (t,z) : [a,b] \\times D \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}$ is continuous. Then $g(z) = \\int_a^b f(t,z) \\, dt $ is analytic on $D$ with $$g'(z) = \\int_a^b \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} (t,z) \\, dt. $$ (P97, Complex Analysis , Freitag) The author did not provide a proof, and said it is \"direct\" from the real case. I am really interested in how one writes this out completely. (probably in a much more neater way than mine's). My attempt: (Correct?) $g:D \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}$ is analytic in $D$ iff $g$ is frechet differentiable at $z$ (in the reals) and $g$ satisfies the Cauchy Riemann equations, i.e, $\\frac{\\partial g }{ \\partial x} = \\frac{1}{i} \\frac{\\partial g} {\\partial y}$ . It is sufficient if we show the partial derivatives are continuous for frechet differnetiability. Let $f(t,z) = u(t,z) + iv(t,z)$ , then, $g(z) = \\int_a^b u(t,z) \\, dt + i \\int_a^b v(t,z) \\, dt $ and it suffices to show $$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\int_a^b u(t,z) \\, dt = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\int_a^b v(t,z) \\, dt , \\quad \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\int_a^b u(t,z) \\,dt = - \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial x} \\int_a^b v(t,z) \\, dt $$ Fix $z_0 \\in D$ and  consider $i: [a,b] \\times [c,d] \\rightarrow [a,b] \\times D$ given by $(t,x) \\mapsto (t,z_0+x)$ which defines continuous function $U = u \\circ i :[a,b] \\times [c,d] \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}.$ We may wlog assume $[c,d] = [-1,1]$ as $D$ is open. We have $\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial x} U (t,0) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}u (t,z_0),$ and $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} U (t,s) = \\mathfrak{R} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} (t,z_0+s)$ is continuous on $[a,b] \\times [-1,1]$ as $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}$ exists and is continuous on $[a,b] \\times D$ . So $\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x}$ is bounded by some constant $C$ on $[a,b] \\times [-1,1]$ . Set $g_n (t) := \\frac{U(t,x_n) - U(t,0)}{x_n }$ for any real seqence $x_n \\rightarrow 0$ .  Existence of partial derivative implies $\\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} g_n(t) = \\frac{\\partial}{ \\partial x} U(t,0).$ $g_n:[a,b] \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}$ is a continuous function; by MVT, exists some $x' $ between $x_n$ and $0$ such that $$ |g_n(t)| \\le \\Big| \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} U(t,x') \\Big| \\le C \\chi_{[a,b]}$$ Applying DCT to the sequence of measurable functions $\\{g_n(t)\\}$ , \\begin{align*} \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\int_{[a,b]} \\frac{U(t,x_n) -U(t,0)}{x_n} \\, dt & = \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\int_{[a,b]} g_n(t) \\, dt  \\\\ \n& = \\int_{[a,b]} \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} g_n(t) \\, dt \\\\\n&  = \\int_{[a,b]} \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial x} U(t,0) \\, dt  \n\\end{align*} As this holds for any sequence $x_n \\rightarrow 0$ , the function $G(x):= \\int_{[a,b]} \\frac{U(t,x) - U(t,0)}{x}\\, dt$ ,  is sequentially convergent at $0$ , hence continuous at $0$ , with $$  \\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0} G(x) =  \\int_{[a,b]} \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial x} U(t,0) \\, dt  $$ By definition, the above equality is equivalent to, $$ \\frac{ \\partial }{\\partial x}  \\Big| _{z_0} \\int_a^b u(t,z) \\, dt = \\int_a^b \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial x} \\Big| _{z_0} u(t,z) \\,dt . $$ We obtain, by the same argument, an equation for the partials with respect to $y$ . As $f$ is holomorphic, we have $$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}(t,z_0) = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}(t,z_0) . $$ As the choice $z_0 \\in D$ was arbitrary, Cauchy Riemann Equations are satisfied on whole of $D$ , and $g$ is holomorphic on whole of $D$ .",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The \"real case\" was maybe proven using the MVT, and we don't have that in the complex environment. We therefore have to start afresh. Fix a point $z_0\\in D$. We have to prove that\n$$\\lim_{h\\to0}{g(z_0+h)-g(z_0)\\over h}=\\int_a^b f_z(t,z_0)\\>dt\\ .\\tag{1}$$\nBy assumption there is a closed disc $B$ of radius $r_0>0$ around $z_0$ such that $f_z$ is continuous, hence uniformly continuous, on the set $R:=[a,b]\\times B$. For complex $h$ with $0<|h|<r_0$ we then have\n$$f(t,z_0+h)-f(t,z_0)=\\int_{z_0}^{z_0+h}f_z(t,z)\\>dz=h\\int_0^1 f_z(t,z_0+\\tau h)\\>d\\tau$$\nand therefore\n$$\\Phi(t,h):={f(t,z_0+h)-f(t,z_0)\\over h}-f_z(t,z_0)=\\int_0^1 \\bigl(f_z(t,z_0+\\tau h)-f_z(t,z_0)\\bigr)\\>d\\tau\\ .$$\nThe uniform continuity of $f_z$ on $R$ now allows to conclude the following: Given an $\\epsilon>0$ there is a $\\delta>0$ such that \n$$\\bigl|\\Phi(t,h)\\bigr|<\\epsilon\\qquad\\bigl(a\\leq t\\leq b, \\ 0< |h|<\\delta)\\ .$$\nThis means that $\\lim_{h\\to0}\\Phi(t,h)=0$ uniformly in $t$. Since\n$${g(z_0+h)-g(z_0)\\over h}-\\int_a^b f_z(t,z_0)\\>dt=\\int_a^b \\Phi(t,h)\\>dt$$\nwe may infer $(1)$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question about proving Leibniz's Rule for Complex functions. Let me start by reading through the original question carefully to understand what's being asked and what the assumptions are.\n\nThe user mentions a function f(t,z) that's continuous on [a,b] × D, where D is an open subset of the complex plane. They state that f is analytic in D for each t in [a,b], and the partial derivative of f with respect to z is also continuous on [a,b] × D. The problem is to show that the integral g(z) = ∫ₐᵇ f(t,z) dt is analytic on D with its derivative being the integral of the partial derivative of f.\n\nThe example provided in the user's instruction had assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. So I need to extract all the conditions given in the problem.\n\nFirst, the function f is defined from [a,b] × D to ℂ. So one assumption is about the domain and codomain of f. Then, f is continuous. That's another assumption. Next, f is analytic in D for all t in [a,b]. Then, the partial derivative ∂f/∂z is continuous on [a,b] × D. The problem is to prove that g(z) is analytic with the derivative as stated.\n\nWait, the original problem mentions that f is analytic in D for all t in [a,b]. So that's a key condition. Also, the partial derivative's continuity is another condition. The user also mentions that Freitag's book states this without proof, referring to the real case. The user's attempt involves breaking into real and imaginary parts and checking Cauchy-Riemann equations.\n\nBut for the structured problem, I just need the assumptions and the problem statement. So the assumptions would be:\n\n1. f: [a,b] × D → ℂ is continuous.\n2. D is an open subset of ℂ.\n3. For each t ∈ [a,b], f(t,z) is analytic in z ∈ D.\n4. The partial derivative ∂f/∂z (t,z) is continuous on [a,b] × D.\n\nThe problem is to prove that g(z) = ∫ₐᵇ f(t,z) dt is analytic on D with derivative g’(z) = ∫ₐᵇ ∂f/∂z (t,z) dt.\n\nI need to check if each assumption is single-property and applied to one object. Let's see:\n\n- First assumption: f is continuous on [a,b] × D. That's one property (continuity) of f.\n- Second: D is open. That's a property of D.\n- Third: For each t, f(t,z) is analytic in z. That's a property of f related to z for each t.\n- Fourth: The partial derivative is continuous. Another property of ∂f/∂z.\n\nYes, each is a separate condition. So that's the structure.",
