    "Content": "I'm reading Lang's Undergraduate Analysis: Let ${n}\\choose{k}$ denote the binomial coefficient, $${n\\choose k}=\\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$ where $n,k$ are integers $\\geq0,0\\leq k\\leq n$ , and $0!$ is defined to be $1$ . Prove the following assertion: $${n\\choose k}={n\\choose n-k}$$ I proceded by making the adequate substitutions: $${n\\choose n-k}=\\frac{n!}{\\color{red}{(n-k)}!(n-\\color{red}{(n-k)})!}$$ And then I simplified and achieved: $$\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!-k!}$$ But I'm not sure on how to proceed from here, I've noticed that this result is very similar to $\\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$ . What should I do? I guess it has something to do with the statement about the nature of $n$ and $k$ : $n,k$ are integers $\\geq0,0\\leq k\\leq n$ So should I just change the minus sign to plus sign and think of it as a product of $(n-k)!$ ? $$\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!-k!}\\Rightarrow\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!+k!}\\Rightarrow \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$ I'm in doubt because I've obtained the third result on Mathematica, but obtained the first with paper and pencil. I'm not sure if there are different rules for simplification with factorials. I'm not sure if this $(n-k)!+k!$ mean a sum or a product in this case.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You simply failed to distribute the negative sign (i.e., multiplying the difference by $-1$: $$\\begin{align} n - (n - k) &= n + -1(n -k) \\\\ \\\\& = n + - 1\\cdot n - (-1)\\cdot k \\\\ \\\\\n& = n - n + k \\\\ \\\\ &= k\\end{align}$$ (I.e., Negation distributes over sums and differences.) $${n\\choose n-k}=\\frac{n!}{\\color{red}{(n-k)}!(n-\\color{red}{(n-k)})!} =\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!(n - n + k))!} =\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!(k)!}= \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that the binomial coefficient ${n \\choose k}$ is equal to ${n \\choose n - k}$. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions from the original question. The problem states that $n$ and $k$ are integers greater than or equal to 0, and that $0 \\leq k \\leq n$. Also, the definition of the binomial coefficient is given as $\\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}$, with $0!$ defined as 1. \n\nThe user attempted substituting $n - k$ into the binomial coefficient formula, leading to a step where they simplified the denominator to $(n - k)!k!$ but got confused with a minus sign, thinking they had a subtraction instead of a multiplication. The confusion seems to arise from a miscalculation during substitution. \n\nSo the key assumptions here are about the constraints on $n$ and $k$ and the definition of the binomial coefficient. The problem is to prove the identity using these definitions and constraints. The user's mistake was in the substitution step, probably a typo or a miscalculation when expanding the factorial terms. \n\nI need to structure this into the required format. The assumptions should list each condition separately. The problem statement is to prove the equality of the two binomial coefficients. \n\nLet me check the example provided again. In the example, the assumptions were about $n$ being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions would include the definitions and constraints on $n$ and $k$. Each assumption should be a single line addressing one property.\n\nYes, so:\n\nAssumption 1: $n$ and $k$ are integers ≥ 0.\n\nAssumption 2: 0 ≤ k ≤ n.\n\nAssumption 3: The binomial coefficient ${n \\choose k}$ is defined as $\\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}$.\n\nAssumption 4: $0!$ is defined as 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that ${n \\choose k} = {n \\choose n - k}$.\n\nThat should cover all necessary assumptions and the problem statement clearly.",
