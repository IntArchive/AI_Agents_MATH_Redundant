    "Content": "I have been trying to solve this problem for quite a while. I am still unsure of whether any of the avenues I have pursued have been of any use. Any advice will be much appreciated. Question: Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional inner product space, and let $E$ be an idempotent linear operator on $V$ . Prove that if $EE^* = E^*E$ , then $E$ is self-adjoint. (This is essentially exercise 5(a) in sec. 80 on p.162 of Paul R. Halmos, Finite-Dimensional Vector Spaces , but Halmos didn't assume that the dimension of $V$ is finite.)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If $E$ is normal, $\\| E x \\| = \\|E^* x \\|$ for all $x$.  Similarly, $I-E$ is normal,\nso $\\|(I-E) x\\| = \\|(I - E^*)x \\|$.  In particular, since $(I-E)Ex = 0$, $(I-E^*)Ex = 0$, i.e. $E^* E = E$, and similarly since $E(I-E)x = 0$,  $E^*(I-E)x = 0$, i.e. $E^* E  = E^* $.  But those together say  $E = E^*$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about proving that a normal, idempotent linear operator on a finite-dimensional inner product space must be self-adjoint. Let me break down the given information and what needs to be proven.\n\nFirst, let's list out the assumptions from the problem. The user mentioned the original problem and an example, so I need to extract the key points. The problem states:\n\n- V is a finite-dimensional inner product space.\n- E is an idempotent linear operator on V. Idempotent means that E squared equals E, so E² = E.\n- E is normal, which means that EE* = E*E, where E* is the adjoint of E.\n- The goal is to prove that E is self-adjoint, i.e., E* = E.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"if EE* = E*E, then E is self-adjoint.\" So the assumptions are the finite-dimensional inner product space, E is idempotent, E is normal (EE* = E*E). The conclusion is E is self-adjoint.\n\nNow, I need to structure this into the required format. The user's example separated each assumption line by line. So each assumption should be a single property applied to one object.\n\nSo, the assumptions would be:\n\n- V is a finite-dimensional inner product space.\n- E is a linear operator on V.\n- E is idempotent (E² = E).\n- E is normal (EE* = E*E).\n\nThen the problem is to prove that E is self-adjoint (E* = E).\n\nI need to make sure there are no extra assumptions. The user in the example didn't include the divisibility by 7 in the problem's assumption, but the original problem here doesn't mention anything else. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem from the user's input:\n\n\"Let V be a finite-dimensional inner product space, and let E be an idempotent linear operator on V. Prove that if EE* = E*E, then E is self-adjoint.\"\n\nSo yes, the key points are:\n\n1. V is finite-dimensional inner product space.\n2. E is a linear operator on V.\n3. E is idempotent (E² = E).\n4. EE* = E*E (E is normal).\n\nProblem: Prove E is self-adjoint.\n\nTherefore, structuring the answer accordingly.",
