This question comes from an Instagram post and WolframAlpha numerically verifies the series converges to $\\frac{\\pi^2}{8}$ for at least $60$ decimal points.  I have seen several infinite series involving arctangent and Fibonacci numbers that end up in a telescoping sum through arctangent angle addition/subtraction identities, but I'm not sure how to approach this series with the product of two arctangent functions. I'm looking for a solution that doesn't rely on knowing the series converges to $\\frac{\\pi^2}{8}$ .",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $a_n=\\arctan(1/F_n)$ , $b_n=a_n^2$ for even $n$ , and $b_n=a_{n-1}a_{n+1}$ for odd $n$ (here we assume $a_0=\\pi/2$ , so that $b_1=\\pi^2/8$ ). Now I claim that $\\color{blue}{a_n a_{n+1}=b_n-b_{n+1}}$ . We have $$a_{n-1}-a_{n+1}=\\arctan\\frac{F_{n+1}-F_{n-1}}{F_{n-1}F_{n+1}+1}=\\arctan\\frac{F_n}{F_n^2+1+(-1)^n}$$ (with $n=1$ checked separately), hence $a_{n-1}-a_{n+1}=a_n$ for odd $n$ , and \\begin{align*}\nn\\text{ is odd }&\\implies b_n-b_{n+1}=a_{n-1}a_{n+1}-a_{n+1}^2=(a_{n-1}-a_{n+1})a_{n+1},\\\\n\\text{ is even }&\\implies b_n-b_{n+1}=a_n^2-a_n a_{n+2}=a_n(a_n-a_{n+2}),\n\\end{align*} giving $a_n a_{n+1}$ in both cases.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me first read through the original question carefully. The user wants to prove that the infinite sum of the product of two arctangent terms involving Fibonacci numbers equals π²/8. \n\nThe original question mentions that F_n is the nth Fibonacci number, with F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, etc. The series converges to π²/8 as verified by WolframAlpha. The user also notes that they've seen similar series involving arctangent and Fibonacci numbers that telescope using angle addition/subtraction identities, but here it's a product of two arctangents, so the approach might be different. They want a solution that doesn't assume the convergence to π²/8.\n\nNow, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem is about an infinite series sum from n=1 to infinity of arctan(1/F_n) * arctan(1/F_{n+1}), and it equals π²/8. The Fibonacci sequence is defined here with F_1=1, F_2=1, and so on. So the assumptions would include the definition of the Fibonacci numbers, starting values, and perhaps the domain of the summation (n starting at 1 and going to infinity). But since the problem is about proving the sum equals π²/8, the key assumptions are related to the Fibonacci sequence definition and the terms of the series.\n\nWait, the example given in the user's instruction included an assumption about n being an integer and n being divisible by 7, but in the problem here, the summation is over all n starting from 1 to infinity, so each term is defined for each n in natural numbers. The Fibonacci numbers are defined recursively, so perhaps the assumptions should include the starting terms F_1=1, F_2=1, and the recurrence relation F_{n+1} = F_n + F_{n-1}. But the original problem statement doesn't mention the recurrence, only the examples of F_1, F_2, F_3. However, since Fibonacci numbers are standard, maybe the problem assumes the standard definition. But to be precise, the assumptions should list the necessary conditions.\n\nLooking back at the example, the assumptions were about the variable n (integer, divisible by 7). Here, the problem involves Fibonacci numbers, so the assumptions would be:\n\n- For each n ≥ 1, F_n is the nth Fibonacci number.\n- F_1 = 1.\n- F_2 = 1.\n- For each n ≥ 1, F_{n+1} = F_n + F_{n−1} (assuming this is necessary for the problem's context, but the original question may not explicitly state this, but since they mention Fibonacci numbers, it's implied).\n\nBut wait, the original question says \"F_n represents the n-th Fibonacci number (F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, etc.)\", so the problem explicitly defines F_1 and F_2, and implicitly the rest follow the Fibonacci recurrence. So the assumptions should list:\n\n- F_1 = 1,\n- F_2 = 1,\n- For n ≥ 1, F_{n+1} = F_n + F_{n-1} (with the understanding that F_0 would need to be defined if necessary, but since the problem starts at n=1, maybe F_0 isn't needed here. However, the standard Fibonacci sequence is usually defined with F_1=1, F_2=1, and F_{n} = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} for n ≥ 3. So perhaps the recurrence relation is part of the definition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem doesn't require listing the recurrence relation as an assumption, since it's given that F_n is the nth Fibonacci number with F_1=1, F_2=1, etc. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- F_n is the nth Fibonacci number,\n- F_1 = 1,\n- F_2 = 1,\n- The series is summed from n=1 to infinity.\n\nWait, but the problem is about the sum from n=1 to infinity, so maybe that's part of the problem statement rather than an assumption. The key assumptions here are about the definition of the Fibonacci numbers, which are necessary for the terms in the series. So the problem assumes that each term in the series uses consecutive Fibonacci numbers, defined with F_1=1 and F_2=1. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- F_n is the nth Fibonacci number,\n- F_1 = 1,\n- F_2 = 1.\n\nBut the problem statement already mentions F_1=1, F_2=1, so those are explicit assumptions. The user might be expected to know that Fibonacci numbers follow the recurrence relation, but perhaps that's not necessary to list here. Alternatively, since the problem involves F_{n} and F_{n+1}, the recurrence relation might be important for the proof, hence it should be an assumption. However, the original problem does not state the recurrence; it's part of the definition of Fibonacci numbers. So maybe the only explicit assumptions are the starting values. But according to the example, assumptions are conditions applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\n- For each n ≥ 1, F_n is the nth Fibonacci number,\n- F_1 = 1,\n- F_2 = 1,\n- For each n ≥ 3, F_n = F_{n−1} + F_{n−2}.\n\nBut the original problem doesn't state the recurrence explicitly, only gives F_1, F_2, F_3. However, the problem is about the infinite sum, so the key assumptions are that the Fibonacci sequence is defined as usual. Alternatively, maybe the problem only requires the initial terms since the recurrence is standard. Hmm. Let me check the example again. In the example, the user had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So each assumption is a single condition on an object. Here, for the Fibonacci numbers, the definition includes multiple parts: F_1=1, F_2=1, and the recurrence. So each of these would be separate assumptions.\n\nThus, the assumptions would be:\n\n- F_n is the nth Fibonacci number,\n- F_1 = 1,\n- F_2 = 1,\n- For each integer n ≥ 1, F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_n.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions F_{n} and F_{n+1}, so perhaps the recurrence is necessary. However, the original problem statement only gives F_1, F_2, F_3, and says \"etc.\", implying the standard Fibonacci sequence. So perhaps the problem's assumptions are:\n\n- The sequence {F_n} is the Fibonacci sequence defined by F_1 = 1, F_2 = 1, and F_{n+1} = F_n + F_{n−1} for n ≥ 2.\n\nBut the example has each assumption as a single line. So maybe:\n\n- {F_n} is the Fibonacci sequence,\n- F_1 = 1,\n- F_2 = 1,\n- For all n ≥ 1, F_{n+1} = F_n + F_{n−1} (with F_0 = 0? Wait, but the problem starts at n=1. Hmm, maybe not necessary. If the problem starts at n=1, then F_3 = F_2 + F_1 = 1 + 1 = 2, which matches the given F_3=2. So perhaps the recurrence is F_{n} = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} for n ≥ 3. But how to phrase that as an assumption? Maybe:\n\n- For each integer n ≥ 3, F_n = F_{n−1} + F_{n−2}.\n\nBut the user's example listed each assumption as a separate line. So, perhaps:\n\n- For each integer n ≥ 1, F_n is the nth Fibonacci number,\n- F_1 = 1,\n- F_2 = 1,\n- For each integer n ≥ 3, F_n = F_{n−1} + F_{n−2}.\n\nBut maybe the problem doesn't require specifying the recurrence because it's part of the definition of Fibonacci numbers. However, since the problem explicitly states F_1=1, F_2=1, etc., perhaps the only necessary assumptions are the starting terms. Alternatively, the problem may assume that the Fibonacci numbers are defined as per standard, so the user might not need to list the recurrence. However, to be thorough, perhaps include the recurrence as an assumption because the problem depends on the relation between consecutive terms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key assumptions are just the starting terms. Let me look at the example again. In the example, the user included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. The problem here is about the sum from n=1 to infinity, so n is a positive integer, which might be an assumption. However, the problem is about the sum over all n starting at 1, so perhaps the assumption is that n ranges over positive integers. But in the example, the assumption was that n is an integer. So here, the problem involves n as an index in the summation from 1 to infinity, so n is a positive integer.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should include:\n\n- n is a positive integer,\n- F_n is the nth Fibonacci number,\n- F_1 = 1,\n- F_2 = 1.\n\nAdditionally, the problem might rely on the convergence of the series, but the user says WolframAlpha verified convergence, and the problem is to prove it equals π²/8, so convergence is part of the problem, not an assumption. The problem statement says \"the series converges to π²/8\", but the user wants a solution that doesn't rely on knowing that. So the problem is to prove both convergence and the value, or maybe assume convergence and find the value, but the user wants a proof that doesn't assume the limit. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- For each positive integer n, F_n is the nth Fibonacci number with F_1 = 1, F_2 = 1,\n- The series ∑_{n=1}^∞ arctan(1/F_n) arctan(1/F_{n+1}) converges.\n\nBut the original problem doesn't state assumptions about convergence; it's part of what needs to be proven. So maybe the only assumptions are the definition of the Fibonacci numbers. Let me think again.\n\nThe original problem states: \"Prove that the sum from n=1 to infinity of arctan(1/F_n) arctan(1/F_{n+1}) equals π²/8 where F_n represents the nth Fibonacci number (F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, etc.).\" So the given data is the definition of F_n as the Fibonacci sequence starting with 1,1,2,... Therefore, the assumptions needed are:\n\n- F_n is the nth Fibonacci number,\n- F_1 = 1,\n- F_2 = 1,\n- For all n ≥ 1, F_{n+1} = F_n + F_{n−1} (with appropriate initial terms).\n\nBut the problem may not require listing the recurrence if it's part of the Fibonacci definition. However, since the problem explicitly gives F_1 and F_2, perhaps the assumptions should include those starting values. So breaking down:\n\nEach assumption is one line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\n- For each integer n ≥ 1, F_n is the nth Fibonacci number.\n- F_1 = 1.\n- F_2 = 1.\n- For each integer n ≥ 1, F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_n.\n\nAlternatively, the recurrence could be phrased as F_{n+1} = F_n + F_{n−1} for n ≥ 2. But since the problem involves consecutive terms F_n and F_{n+1}, perhaps the recurrence relation is crucial. However, in the original problem statement, the user only provides F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, etc., so the recurrence is implied. Therefore, the necessary assumptions are:\n\n- F_1 = 1,\n- F_2 = 1,\n- For each integer n ≥ 1, F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_n.\n\nBut maybe the index for the recurrence is different. Let's check: For standard Fibonacci, F_{n} = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} for n ≥ 3. So perhaps:\n\n- For each integer n ≥ 3, F_n = F_{n−1} + F_{n−2}.\n\nBut in the problem, the terms are F_n and F_{n+1}, so maybe the recurrence is F_{n+1} = F_n + F_{n−1} for n ≥ 2. However, for the purposes of this problem, maybe the exact recurrence isn't necessary as an assumption, but given that F_n is the Fibonacci sequence with F_1=1, F_2=1, that's sufficient. Since the example in the user's instruction included specific conditions on n, here the assumptions are about the Fibonacci numbers.\n\nIn the example, the user included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, the key assumptions are that F_n is the Fibonacci sequence as defined. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- {F_n} is the Fibonacci sequence defined by F_1 = 1 and F_2 = 1.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption is a single line addressing one property. So splitting it:\n\n- F_1 = 1,\n- F_2 = 1,\n- For each integer n ≥ 1, F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_n.\n\nBut maybe the problem doesn't need the recurrence, but just the definition. However, since the problem involves consecutive terms, the recurrence is essential for any potential telescoping or relations between terms. Therefore, including the recurrence as an assumption makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes the standard Fibonacci sequence, so the only necessary assumptions are the starting terms. However, to ensure clarity, listing both starting terms and the recurrence relation is better.\n\nSo compiling the assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\n- F_n is the nth Fibonacci number.\n- F_1 = 1.\n- F_2 = 1.\n- For each integer n ≥ 1, F_{n+1} = F_n + F_{n−1}.\n\nWait, but for n ≥ 1, F_{n+1} = F_n + F_{n−1} would require F_0 to be defined. Since F_1 and F_2 are 1, then if we consider n=1, F_{2} = F_1 + F_0, which would imply F_0 = 0. But the problem doesn't mention F_0. Alternatively, the standard Fibonacci sequence is defined with F_1=1, F_2=1, and for n ≥ 3, F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}. So perhaps the recurrence should be:\n\n- For each integer n ≥ 3, F_n = F_{n−1} + F_{n−2}.\n\nBut then, when n=3, F_3 = F_2 + F_1 = 1 + 1 = 2, which matches the given F_3=2. So the correct recurrence is for n ≥ 3, F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}. Therefore, the assumption should be:\n\n- For each integer n ≥ 3, F_n = F_{n−1} + F_{n−2}.\n\nBut how does this relate to the terms in the problem? The problem uses F_n and F_{n+1}, so for example, when n=1, F_1=1 and F_2=1; when n=2, F_2=1 and F_3=2; etc. The recurrence for n≥3 defines F_n based on previous terms. So perhaps the key is to list the initial terms and the recurrence relation.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption is a single line. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- F_n is the nth Fibonacci number.\n- F_1 = 1.\n- F_2 = 1.\n- For each integer n ≥ 3, F_n = F_{n−1} + F_{n−2}.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem uses the standard Fibonacci definition, perhaps the user doesn't need to list all those assumptions, but since the problem explicitly states F_1=1, F_2=1, etc., they should be included.\n\nNow, the problem statement is to prove the sum equals π²/8. So the formatted problem would list the assumptions as above, then state the problem.\n\nBut wait, the example in the user's instruction had the original problem mentioning \"for every integer n\", and the formatted problem's assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". In this case, the problem is about an infinite series, so n ranges over positive integers. However, the problem doesn't specify any restriction on n beyond being in the Fibonacci sequence, which is already covered by the definition of F_n.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should include:\n\n- For each positive integer n, F_n is the nth Fibonacci number,\n- F_1 = 1,\n- F_2 = 1,\n- For each integer n ≥ 1, F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_n.\n\nBut maybe the last assumption is redundant if we already state that F_n is the Fibonacci number. However, to be explicit, especially since the Fibonacci sequence can sometimes start with F_0=0, F_1=1, but here it starts with F_1=1, F_2=1. So specifying the initial terms and the recurrence is important.\n\nAnother approach: The problem mentions \"F_n represents the n-th fibonacci number (F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, etc.)\". So the assumptions are:\n\n- F_n is the nth Fibonacci number,\n- F_1 = 1,\n- F_2 = 1,\n- The sequence {F_n} satisfies the Fibonacci recurrence relation.\n\nBut to split into individual lines:\n\n- F_n is the nth Fibonacci number.\n- F_1 = 1.\n- F_2 = 1.\n- For each integer n ≥ 1, F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_n.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem starts with F_1, the recurrence for n≥1 would be F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_n. For example, F_3 = F_2 + F_1 = 1+1=2, which matches.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have these assumptions.",
