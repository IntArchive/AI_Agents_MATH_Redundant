    "Content": "According to WolframAlpha, $i^i=e^{-\\pi/2}$ but I don't know how I can prove it.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Write $i=e^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}i}$, then $i^i=(e^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}i})^i = e^{-\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Be careful though, taking complex powers is more... complex... than it may appear on first sight $-$ see here for more info. In particular, it's not well-defined (until we make some choice that makes it well-defined); we could just have well written $i=e^{\\frac{5\\pi}{2}i}$ and obtained $i^i=e^{-\\frac{5\\pi}{2}}$. But $i^i$ can't be equal to both $e^{-\\frac{\\pi}{2}}$ and $e^{-\\frac{5\\pi}{2}}$ can it? Despite the lack-of-well-defined-ness, though, $i^i$ is always real, no matter which '$i^{\\text{th}}$ power of $i$' we decide to take. More depth: If $z,\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{C}$ then we can define\n$$z^{\\alpha} = \\exp(\\alpha \\log z)$$\nwhere $\\exp w$ is defined in some independent manner, e.g. by its power series. The complex logarithm is defined by\n$$\\log z = \\log \\left| z \\right| + i\\arg z$$\nand therefore depends on our choice of range of argument. If we fix a range of argument, though, then $z^{\\alpha}$ becomes well-defined. Now, here, $z=i$ and so $\\log i = i\\arg i$, so\n$$i^i = \\exp (i \\cdot i\\arg i) = \\exp (-\\arg i)$$\nso no matter what we choose for our range of argument, we always have $i^i \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Fun stuff, eh?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants to prove that \\( i^i \\) is a real number and specifically equals \\( e^{-\\pi/2} \\). Hmm, complex numbers can be tricky, especially when dealing with exponents. Let me recall Euler's formula here. \n\nFirst, I know that any complex number can be expressed in polar form. For \\( i \\), which is the imaginary unit, its polar form should be \\( e^{i\\pi/2} \\) because it's located at 90 degrees on the unit circle. So, \\( i = e^{i\\pi/2 + 2\\pi k i} \\) where \\( k \\) is any integer, right? Because angles in polar form are periodic with period \\( 2\\pi \\).\n\nNow, when raising \\( i \\) to the power of \\( i \\), we can use the property \\( a^b = e^{b \\ln a} \\). But since we're dealing with complex logarithms, the logarithm isn't single-valued. So, \\( i^i = e^{i \\ln i} \\). The logarithm of \\( i \\) would be \\( \\ln i = i\\pi/2 + 2\\pi k i \\), considering the different branches. \n\nSubstituting that back, we get \\( i^i = e^{i (i\\pi/2 + 2\\pi k i)} = e^{i^2 \\pi/2 + i^2 2\\pi k} \\). Since \\( i^2 = -1 \\), this simplifies to \\( e^{-\\pi/2 - 2\\pi k} \\). The principal value is usually taken when \\( k = 0 \\), so that gives \\( e^{-\\pi/2} \\), which is a real number. \n\nWait, but the problem statement from the user just mentions proving \\( i^i \\) is real, not necessarily the specific value. However, the example answer included the specific value \\( e^{-\\pi/2} \\). So maybe we need to show both that it's real and equals that expression. \n\nLet me check if there are other branches where \\( k \\) isn't zero. For example, if \\( k = 1 \\), then it would be \\( e^{-\\pi/2 - 2\\pi} \\), which is also real but a different value. However, in complex analysis, the principal value is typically considered, which uses the principal branch of the logarithm where \\( k = 0 \\). Therefore, the principal value of \\( i^i \\) is indeed \\( e^{-\\pi/2} \\), a real number. \n\nBut do we need any assumptions here? The original problem doesn't specify any constraints, but when dealing with complex exponents, the choice of branch is important. However, since the question is about proving \\( i^i \\) is real and the example answer includes \\( e^{-\\pi/2} \\), the key assumption here is probably that we're using the principal branch of the complex logarithm. \n\nSo, structuring the problem according to the required format, the assumption would be that we're considering the principal value of the complex logarithm. The problem is then to prove that \\( i^i \\) is a real number equal to \\( e^{-\\pi/2} \\).",
