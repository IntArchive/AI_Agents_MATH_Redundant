    "Content": "The Denjoy-Riesz Theorem states that any compact zero-dimensional subset of the plane is contained in the image of an embedded copy of the arc $[0,1]$ .  The only place I've seen this proved is in Kuratowski's Topology II, and it's proved as a trivial consequence of a huge body of theory on unicoherence, Janiszewski spaces, characterizations of the sphere etc. The \"original proof\" by Riesz is known to have flaws.  Actually I've also seen it proved in a paper by Moore, but there he proves a generalization and it's atrocious to read as well. Is there a more self-contained, modern proof accessible anywhere?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I'll use the Schoenflies Theorem: If $J_1$ and $J_2$ are Jordan curves in the plane (or sphere) there is an ambient plane (resp. sphere) isotopy sending $J_1$ to $J_2$ .  This is sometimes called the \"strong\" Schoenflies Theorem (it's a consequence of the Annulus Theorem ).  Let $\\text{Int}(J)$ and $\\text{Ext}(J)$ denote the bounded and unbounded complementary regions of $J$ , respectively. If $J_1, \\dots, J_n$ are a collection of mutually disjoint Jordan curves, then call the collection simple if no $J_i$ is contained in any $\\text{Int}(J_k)$ .  By induction and repeated use of the Schoenflies Theorem: Observation 1: Any two simple collections of Jordan curves are ambient\nisotopic if they have the same number of elements. A continuum (plural continua ) is a compact, connected metric space.  We need the following theorem: A nested intersection of continua is a continuum, as proved in the body of the question here .  Relevant is that since the Cantor Set is totally disconnected, it doesn't contain a non-degenerate continuum. Let $B_\\epsilon(x) = \\lbrace y: |x-y| \\leq \\epsilon \\rbrace$ and let $B_\\epsilon(X) = \\cup_{x \\in X} B_\\epsilon(x)$ .  If $X \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ is a continuum then let $X_\\circ$ denote the filled in continuum obtained by adding each bounded component of its complement (it's a continuum since its complement is open and a sufficiently large disc around $X$ has the boundary bumping property ). Lemma 1: Let $C_1$ and $C_2$ be disjoint Cantor sets in the plane (or sphere).\nThen there is a simple pair of disjoint Jordan curves $J_1$ and $J_2$ with $C_i \\subset \\text{Int}(J_i)$ . Proof: By Observation 1, it's sufficient to show that there are simple collections $\\mathcal{A}_1$ and $\\mathcal{A}_2$ containing $C_1$ and $C_2$ respectively such that $\\mathcal{A} = \\mathcal{A}_1 \\cup \\mathcal{A}_2$ is also simple, since in this case it is explicitly constructible after suitable isotopy.  Since each $C_i$ is compact each $B_\\epsilon(C_i)$ is a finite cover by Euclidean discs and thus each complementary component is a Jordan domain (apart from the unbounded one). Letting $\\epsilon$ be small enough that $B_\\epsilon(C_1) \\cap B_\\epsilon(C_2) = \\varnothing$ , we get disjoint covers of each such that filling in their components produces covers by Jordan domains.  However, it's possible that for some components $D$ of $B_\\epsilon(C_1)$ and $E$ of $B_\\epsilon(C_2)$ , we have $D_\\circ \\cap E \\neq \\varnothing$ , without loss of generality.  In which case $E$ is contained in a complementary region of $D$ since it's disjoint from it. In $D$ , find a $\\delta$ sufficiently small so that $E$ is no longer contained in any complementary component of $B_\\delta(D \\cap C_1)$ .  If none such existed, then for $\\delta_n = \\frac{1}{n}$ we have that $E$ is contained in a bounded complementary component of each $B_{\\delta_n}(D \\cap C_1)$ , say of component $D_n$ respectively which are nested by construction.  But this is impossible since it would imply the existence of a non-degenerate continuum in $C_1$ , as $D_n$ cannot converge to a point while all separate $E$ from $\\infty$ unless $D_n \\rightarrow E$ , but $D_n \\subset D$ which is disjoint from $E$ and closed. After doing this in each component of $B_\\epsilon(C_1)$ , by finite descent we have a simple collection $\\mathcal{A}_1$ of Jordan curves with interior domains covering $C_1$ such that none intersect $C_2$ , nor do their interiors.  Doing the same for $B_\\epsilon(C_2)$ produces the desired family $\\mathcal{A}$ . QED Let $C$ be the standard Cantor ternary set, viewed as a subset of the real line $\\mathbb{R} \\times \\lbrace 0 \\rbrace \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ .  Let $E$ denote the set of endpoints of the (bounded) deleted intervals in the real line, and let $E_n$ denote the endpoints of the intervals with length $\\frac{1}{3^n}$ , called the $n$ th level of $E$ .  Note that $E$ is dense in $C$ .  Call the removed intervals $U_j^n$ the $n$ th level of removed intervals .  Call the $2^n$ neighborhoods $D_j^n$ complementary to the $n$ th level of removed intervals the $n$ th levels of $C$ .  Note that the collection $\\mathcal{D}_n = \\lbrace D_j^n \\rbrace$ is a covering of $C$ for every $n$ , and each $D_j^n$ is a Cantor set that's clopen in $C$ . Let $I = [0,1]$ be the unit interval.  If $X, Y \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ and $f: X \\rightarrow Y$ is a homeomorphism, we say that an ambient isotopy $F: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\times I \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^2$ extends $f$ if we have that $f(X) \\equiv F(X \\times \\lbrace 1 \\rbrace)$ . Theorem: If $C_1, C_2$ are Cantor sets in the plane and $f: C_1 \\rightarrow C_2$ is a homeomorphism, there exists an ambient plane isotopy extending $f$ . Note that the proof below also works for the sphere. Proof: Let $g$ be an arbitrary homeomorphism from $C_1$ onto $C$ , the standard ternary Cantor set.  We produce an ambient isotopy from $C_1$ to $C$ extending $g$ .  Then there also exists isotopies extending arbitrary homeomorphisms $C_2 \\rightarrow C$ , and homeomorphisms between compact metric spaces are quotient maps.  Thus we may factor $f$ through $g$ to obtain an $h^{-1}$ such that $f = h^{-1} \\circ g: C_1 \\rightarrow C_2$ , a concatenation of ambient isotopies and thus an ambient isotopy itself. By Lemma 1 and Observation 1 there is a simple pair of Jordan curves $J_1, J_2$ around $g^{-1}(D_1^1)$ and $g^{-1}(D_2^1)$ , and these may be isotoped to narrow discs sitting above $D_1, D_2$ as shown below such that the preimages of the first level of $E$ share $x-$ coordinates with their images.  The interior of each is homeomorphic to the plane, so by induction we may apply Lemma 1 and Observation 1 repeatedly to isotope inverses as necessary to approximate $g$ on $g^{-1}(E)$ .  By concatenating isotopies which differ on uniformly smaller sets, we obtain a homotopy on the plane sending $C_1$ to $I$ and which is a homeomorphism for all $t < 1$ .  We need to show it's a homeomorphism at $t = 1$ on $C_1$ , as it is clearly bijective off of $C_1$ . Since $g$ is a homeomorphism, $g^{-1}(E)$ is dense in $C_1$ so it uniquely determines the function $F$ restricted at time $t = 1$ .  Since both are compact metric spaces it's sufficient to show that $F$ is bijective on $C_1$ at $t = 1$ .  But this is immediate by construction, since any two points in $C_1$ are contained in disjoint elements of some $n$ th level of $C$ and these have images with distance bounded below by $\\frac{1}{3^n}$ . QED In higher dimensions the proof breaks down at the observation. Anyone see how to continue to grab the Moore-Kline result?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual mathematics professor and structure a given question from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The example provided shows that the key is to list each assumption line by line and then state the problem clearly.\n\nLooking at the example, the original problem had an assumption about n being an integer and divisible by 7, which were split into two separate lines. Then the problem statement was about proving divisibility by 91. So I need to apply the same logic to the new question provided.\n\nThe question here is about the Denjoy-Riesz Theorem. The user mentions that the theorem states any compact zero-dimensional subset of the plane is contained in the image of an embedded copy of the arc [0,1]. The user is asking for a more accessible, self-contained modern proof, referencing that existing proofs are too involved or flawed.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions from the theorem. The theorem's statement says \"any compact zero-dimensional subset of the plane\". So breaking this down:\n\n1. The subset is compact.\n2. The subset is zero-dimensional.\n3. The subset is in the plane (i.e., in ℝ²).\n\nThese are three separate properties applied to the subset. Each should be a separate assumption line.\n\nThe problem part is to prove that such a subset is contained in the image of an embedded copy of [0,1]. So the problem statement is about proving the existence of such an embedding.\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is only one property. Let me check again:\n\n- Compactness is one property.\n- Zero-dimensional is another.\n- Being in the plane is the third.\n\nYes, each applies to the subset. So the assumptions should list these three points. Then the problem is to prove the containment as per the theorem.\n\nI should avoid adding any other information from the question, like the mentions of the original proofs or the request for a modern proof. The task is to structure the problem, not the request for references or accessibility.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe subset is compact,\nThe subset is zero-dimensional,\nThe subset is a subset of the plane.\nProblem:\nProve that the subset is contained in the image of an embedded copy of the arc [0,1].\n\nThat should align with the example provided, focusing only on the mathematical assumptions and problem statement.",
