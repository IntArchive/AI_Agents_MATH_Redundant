    "Content": "I have just begun to learn about topological group recently and is still not familiar with combining topology and group theory together. I have read a useful property of discrete group on the wikipedia : every discrete subgroup of a Hausdorff group is closed But I have no idea how to prove it. I find that it cannot be proved only\nconsidering the topological structure, since $\\left\\{\\frac{1}{n}: n=1,2,3,...\\right\\}$\nis a discrete subspace of $\\Bbb R$, which is not closed. I don't know how to use the group structure here. Can you please help?  Thanks.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $H$ be a discrete subgroup of a Hausdorff group $G$. Then, of course, $H=\\bigcup_{h\\in H}\\{h\\}$. For each $h\\in G$, the sets $\\{h\\}$ is closed, and the family of closed sets $\\mathcal F=\\{\\{h\\}:h\\in H\\}$ is locally finite: it follows that the union is also closed. Locally finite means: each point of $G$ has a neighborhood $U$ such that $U$ intersects non-trivially finitely many elements of $\\mathcal F$. Later. I guess a hint was not all that was asked for... Of course, we now have to show that $\\mathcal F$ is locally finite... Suppose, to reach a contradiction, that there is a $p\\in G$ such that every neighborhood of $p$ contains infinitely many elements of $H$. As $H$ is discrete, there is an open subset $U\\subseteq G$ such that $U\\cap H=\\{e\\}$; since $G$ is a topological group, there exists an open set $V$ such that $e\\in V$ and $V^{-1}V\\subseteq U.$ Now $pV$ is an open neighborhood of $p$ so the hypothesis implies that there exist distinct $h_1$, $h_2\\in H$ such that $h_1$, $h_2\\in pV$. It follows that $h_1^{-1}h_2\\in V^{-1}V\\subseteq U$ so that $e\\neq h_1^{-1}h_2\\in U\\cap H$. This is absurd.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so the user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into their specified structure. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe original question is about proving that every discrete subgroup of a Hausdorff group is closed. The user mentioned an example where a discrete subspace in ℝ isn't closed, like {1/n | n ∈ ℕ}, which is discrete but not closed. They're confused about how the group structure helps here.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem is about discrete subgroups in Hausdorff groups. So the main assumptions are:\n\n1. The group in question is a Hausdorff group. That's a topological group which is Hausdorff as a topological space.\n2. The subgroup is discrete. Discrete in the topological sense, meaning each point is an open set in the subspace topology.\n\nWait, but the user didn't explicitly state these assumptions. The original question says, \"every discrete subgroup of a Hausdorff group is closed.\" So the assumptions are inherent in the statement. The problem is to prove that under these conditions, the subgroup is closed.\n\nThe original example given by the user shows that in a Hausdorff space (like ℝ), a discrete subspace isn't necessarily closed. But when you add the group structure, things change. So the key here is that it's a subgroup, not just a subset.\n\nSo the assumptions should be:\n\n- G is a Hausdorff group.\n- H is a discrete subgroup of G.\n\nAnd the problem is to prove that H is closed in G.\n\nWait, but in the example provided by the user, the problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in this case, the original problem is a general statement. So the assumptions would be the conditions given in the theorem: the group is Hausdorff, the subgroup is discrete. So each of these should be listed as separate assumptions.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a Hausdorff group,\nH is a subgroup of G,\nH is a discrete subgroup.\n\nProblem:\nProve that H is closed in G.\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"every discrete subgroup of a Hausdorff group is closed.\" So the group is Hausdorff, the subgroup is discrete. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a Hausdorff topological group,\nH is a discrete subgroup of G.\n\nProblem:\nProve that H is closed in G.\n\nBut the user's example broke down the assumptions into separate lines for each property. So in the example, the assumptions were \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" Here, the assumptions would be \"G is a Hausdorff group\" and \"H is a discrete subgroup of G.\" Each on separate lines.\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is only one property applied to one object.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a Hausdorff topological group,\nH is a subgroup of G,\nH is a discrete subgroup.\n\nBut \"H is a subgroup of G\" is one assumption, and \"H is a discrete subgroup\" is another. But in the original problem statement, the subgroup is already discrete. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a Hausdorff topological group,\nH is a discrete subgroup of G.\n\nBut \"H is a discrete subgroup of G\" combines two things: being a subgroup and being discrete. However, according to the user's example, each assumption should address only one property. So maybe split into:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a Hausdorff topological group,\nH is a subgroup of G,\nH is a discrete subspace of G.\n\nYes, that way each line is one property applied to one object. So \"H is a subgroup\" and \"H is discrete as a subspace.\"\n\nThat makes sense. Then the problem is to prove H is closed in G.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a Hausdorff topological group,\nH is a subgroup of G,\nH is a discrete subspace of G.\nProblem:\nProve that H is closed in G.\n\nYes, that fits the structure. Each assumption is a single condition on a single object.",
