    "Content": "Looking for feedback and maybe simpler intuition for my proof of the theorem, shown below The statement of the theorem: Theorem Among all second-order homogeneous PDEs in two dimensions with constant coefficients, show that the only ones that do not change under a rotation of the coordinate\n  system (i.e., are rotationally invariant), have the form $$a\\nabla^2u = bu $$ Proof: The general PDE of those conditions is written as: $$a_1u_{xx} + 2a_2u_{xy} + a_3 u_{yy} + b_1u_x +b_2u_y +cu = 0$$ A counter-clockwise rotation of a point $x,y$ can be given by the rotation matrix is given by the figure below, where with some basic geometry, we can derive $$x' = \\|{\\mathbf{v}}\\|\\cos\\left(\\theta + \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right)\\right) = x\\cos\\theta - y\\sin\\theta$$ $$y' = \\|{\\mathbf{v}}\\|\\sin\\left(\\theta + \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right)\\right) = x\\sin\\theta + y\\cos\\theta$$ This can be summarized in a matrix transformation $$\\begin{bmatrix} x' \\\\ y' \\end{bmatrix} =  \n\\begin{bmatrix} \\cos\\theta & -\\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}x\\\\y\\end{bmatrix}$$ giving the map: \\begin{align*}\nx\\mapsto x'=x\\cos\\theta - y\\sin\\theta \\\\\ny\\mapsto y'=x\\sin\\theta+y\\cos\\theta\n\\end{align*} From here we find derivatives of our new coordinates: $$ \\frac{\\partial x'}{\\partial x} = \\cos\\theta \\quad \\frac{\\partial y'}{\\partial x}=\\sin\\theta$$ $$\\frac{\\partial x'}{\\partial y} = -\\sin\\theta \\quad \\frac{\\partial y'}{\\partial y} = \\cos\\theta$$ Now the first derivatives of $u(x',y')$ with respect to $x,y$ : \\begin{align*}\n\t\t\tu_x = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x'} \\frac{\\partial x'}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y'} \\frac{\\partial y'}{\\partial x} = u_{x'}\\cos\\theta + u_{y'} \\sin\\theta \\\\\n\t\t\tu_y = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x'} \\frac{\\partial x'}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y'} \\frac{\\partial y'}{\\partial y} =  -u_{x'}\\sin\\theta + u_{y'} \\cos\\theta\n\t\t\\end{align*} And then the second derivatives: \\begin{align*}\n\t\t\t&u_{xx} =  u_{x'x'} \\cos^2\\theta +2u_{x'y'}\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta+  u_{y'y'} \\sin^2\\theta \\\\\n\t\t\t&u_{xy} = -u_{x'x'} \\cos\\theta\\sin\\theta - u_{y'x'} \\sin^2\\theta + u_{x'y'} \\cos^2\\theta + u_{y'y'}\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta \\\\\n\t\t\t&u_{yy}=  u_{x'x'} \\sin^2\\theta -2u_{x'y'}\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta+  u_{y'y'} \\cos^2\\theta\n\t\t\\end{align*} Substituting into the general PDE and rearranging factors of partial derivatives, can be written as $$ \\color{blue}{\\widetilde{a_1}u_{x'x'} + \\widetilde{a_2}u_{x'y'} + \\widetilde{a_3} u_{y'y'} + \\widetilde{b_1}u_{x'} +\\widetilde{b_2}u_{y'} +\\widetilde{c}u = 0} $$ where: \\begin{align*}\n\t\t\t &\\widetilde{a_1} =  a_1 \\cos^2\\theta -2a_2\\cos\\theta\\sin\\theta + a_3\\sin^2\\theta \\\\\n\t\t\t &\\widetilde{a_2} = (a_1-a_3)\\sin 2\\theta + 2a_2 \\cos 2\\theta \\\\\n\t\t\t &\\widetilde{a_3} = a_1 \\sin^2\\theta + 2a_2\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta +a_3\\cos^2\\theta \\\\\n\t\t\t &\\widetilde{b_1} = b_1\\cos\\theta - b_2\\sin\\theta  \\\\\n\t\t\t &\\widetilde{b_2} = b_1\\sin\\theta + b_2\\cos\\theta \\\\\n\t\t\t &\\widetilde{c} = c\n\t\t\\end{align*} Since we require rotational invariance, the original equation and the transformed PDE must have the same value,namely $0$ , on all of $u$ . This can be written as $$\\small{a_1u_{xx} + 2a_2u_{xy} + a_3 u_{yy} + b_1u_x +b_2u_y +cu = \\widetilde{a_1}u_{x'x'} + \\widetilde{a_2}u_{x'y'} + \\widetilde{a_3} u_{y'y'} + \\widetilde{b_1}u_{x'} +\\widetilde{b_2}u_{y'} +\\widetilde{c}u} $$ whence: \\begin{align}\n\t\t\t\\tag{1} a_1& = a_1 \\cos^2\\theta -2a_2\\cos\\theta\\sin\\theta + a_3\\sin^2\\theta&\\\\ \n\t\t\t\\tag{2} 2a_2& = (a_1-a_3)\\sin 2\\theta + 2a_2 \\cos 2\\theta& \\\\\n\t\t\t\\tag{3} a_3& = a_1 \\sin^2\\theta + 2a_2\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta +a_3\\cos^2\\theta& \\\\\n\t\t\t\\tag{4} b_1& = b_1\\cos\\theta - b_2\\sin\\theta&\\\\\n\t\t\t\\tag{5} b_2& = b_1\\sin\\theta + b_2\\cos\\theta&\\\\\n\t\t\t\\tag{6} c &= c&\n\t\t\\end{align} Excluding the trivial case where $\\{a_i\\},\\{b_i\\},c = 0$ , we can make several conclusions. Note that the deductions below are made with the understanding that any arbitrary angle $\\theta$ must be valid, hence it is erroneous to apply $\\theta =0$ in order to reach equality. can only be true when $a_1=a_3$ and $a_2=0$ , implies $a_2=0$ and $a_1=a_3$ , like (1) is only true when $a_1=a_3$ and $a_2=0$ , is true when $b_1=b_2=0$ like (4) is true when $b_1=b_2=0$ , implies $c\\in \\mathbb{R}$ is valid. All together we then know $a1=a3$ , $a_2=b_1=b_3=0$ and $c=c$ .\nReturning to the rotated PDE we now know: $$\\widetilde{a_1} =  a_1,\n\t\t\t\\widetilde{a_2} = 0,\n\t\t\t\\widetilde{a_3} = a_1 ,\n\t\t\t\\widetilde{b_1} = 0,\n\t\t\t\\widetilde{b_2} = 0,\n\t\t\t\\widetilde{c} = c\n\t\t$$ So the PDE under a rotation, $u(x',y')$ , becomes \\begin{align*}\n\t\t\t&a_1u_{x'x'} + a_1u_{y'y'} +cu = 0\\\\\n\t\t\t\\Rightarrow& a_1(u_{x'x'}+u_{y'y'}) = -cu \\\\\n\t\t\t\\Rightarrow& a\\nabla^2{u} = bu\n\\end{align*} where we have chosen $a_1=a, -c = b$ for all $a,b\\in\\mathbb{R}$ . This is in terms of the new rotation $u(x',y')$ , and so it remains to show that $\\nabla^2{u(x,y)} = \\nabla^2{u(x',y')}$ , consider from the derivatives before: \\begin{align*}\n\t\t\t&u_{xx} =  u_{x'x'} \\cos^2\\theta +2u_{x'y'}\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta+  u_{y'y'} \\sin^2\\theta \\\\\n\t\t\t&u_{yy}=  u_{x'x'} \\sin^2\\theta -2u_{x'y'}\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta+  u_{y'y'} \\cos^2\\theta\n\t\t\\end{align*} Sum them together $$u_{xx}+u_{yy}=  u_{x'x'} (\\sin^2\\theta+\\cos^2\\theta) -2u_{x'y'}\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta+ 2u_{x'y'}\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta+  u_{y'y'} (\\cos^2\\theta+\\sin^2\\theta)=u_{x'x'}+u_{y'y'}$$ hence, $\\nabla^2{u(x,y)} = \\nabla^2{u(x',y')}$ as required. Therefore a rotation applied to any second order homogeneous 2D PDE with constant coefficents will transform to a PDE of the form $a\\nabla^2{u} = bu$ under the rotated coordinate $x',y'$ , which we have shown to be equivalent under the regular coordinates $x,y$ . This is the only PDE that is invariant under rotation. $$\\tag*{$\\blacksquare$}$$ Additional Remark Also was just curious about rotational invariant functions and operators. Anything that solves laplaces equation ( $\\nabla^2=0$ ) is called a harmonic function, and satisfies properties such as the mean value property and the maximal principle. I assumed at first harmonic functions meant they were radial, but I think it is more along the lines of being symmetric? The laplacian is rotationally invariant but the laplace equation has some solutions which are radial (rotationally invariant) and some which are not. I also noticed that the converse is not true, i.e, a radial function does not imply $\\nabla^2  = 0$ , like $f(x,y)=x^2+y^2$ See bounty remark below",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Perhaps writing the real variables $x$ and $y$ as complex variables $z$ and $\\bar{z}$ could provide some information as expected. Define \\begin{align}\nz&=x+iy,\\\\\n\\bar{z}&=x-iy,\n\\end{align} which yields \\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}&=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}+\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\bar{z}},\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}&=i\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\bar{z}}\\right).\n\\end{align} Thanks to these relations, we have \\begin{align}\nu_x&=u_z+u_{\\bar{z}},\\\\\nu_y&=i\\left(u_z-u_{\\bar{z}}\\right),\\\\\nu_{xx}&=u_{zz}+2u_{z\\bar{z}}+u_{\\bar{z}\\bar{z}},\\\\\nu_{xy}&=i\\left(u_{zz}-u_{\\bar{z}\\bar{z}}\\right),\\\\\nu_{yy}&=-\\left(u_{zz}-2u_{z\\bar{z}}+u_{\\bar{z}\\bar{z}}\\right).\n\\end{align} As a consequence, $$\na_1u_{xx}+2a_2u_{xy}+a_3u_{yy}+b_1u_x+b_2u_y+cu=0\n$$ is equivalent to \\begin{equation}\n\\left(a_1+2ia_2-a_3\\right)u_{zz}+2\\left(a_1+a_3\\right)u_{z\\bar{z}}+\\left(a_1-2ia_2-a_3\\right)u_{\\bar{z}\\bar{z}}+\\left(b_1+ib_2\\right)u_z+\\left(b_1-ib_2\\right)u_{\\bar{z}}+cu=0.\\tag{1}\n\\end{equation} Now, for rotational transformation, we have $$\nz\\to e^{i\\theta}z\n$$ for some $\\theta\\in\\left[0,2\\pi\\right)$ . Under this transformation, it is straightforward that Eq. $(1)$ becomes \\begin{equation}\ne^{-2i\\theta}\\left(a_1+2ia_2-a_3\\right)u_{zz}+2\\left(a_1+a_3\\right)u_{z\\bar{z}}+e^{2i\\theta}\\left(a_1-2ia_2-a_3\\right)u_{\\bar{z}\\bar{z}}+e^{-i\\theta}\\left(b_1+ib_2\\right)u_z+e^{i\\theta}\\left(b_1-ib_2\\right)u_{\\bar{z}}+cu=0.\\tag{2}\n\\end{equation} Finally, note that the rotational invariance is equivalent to the arbitrariness of $\\theta$ . Hence compare Eqs. $(1)$ and $(2)$ , and the invariance implies the following cases. If $c\\ne 0$ , the invariance forces \\begin{align}\na_1+2ia_2-a_3&=0,\\\\\na_1-2ia_2-a_3&=0,\\\\\nb_1+ib_2&=0,\\\\\nb_1-ib_2&=0.\n\\end{align} These results indicate that $a_1=a_3$ and $a_2=b_1=b_2=0$ , as is expected. If $c=0$ and $a_1+a_3\\ne 0$ , obviously the same result apply, and we still have the expected conclusion. If $c=0$ and $a_1+a_3=0$ and $a_1+2ia_2-a_3\\ne 0$ (i.e., $a_1+ia_2\\ne 0$ ), we have \\begin{align}\na_1-2ia_2-a_3&=0,\\\\\nb_1+ib_2&=0,\\\\\nb_1-ib_2&=0,\n\\end{align} which, however, do not admit any real solution: the four equalities yield $a_1=a_2=0$ and violate the condition $a_1+ia_2\\ne 0$ . If $c=0$ and $a_1+a_3=0$ and $a_1+2ia_2-a_3=0$ , these conditions lead to $a_1=a_2=a_3=0$ , making the equation no longer second order. To sum up, the desired conclusion is completely proven. Solutions to the Laplace equation and harmonic functions are exactly the same. As you mentioned, one way to define the harmonic functions is to take them as the solutions to the Laplace equation. Harmonic functions are not necessarily radial. Radial harmonic functions are called the fundamental solutions to the Laplace equation. In 2-D, it is $\\log r$ ; in 3-D, it is $1/r$ . These solutions are essential, and can be made use of to construct Green functions to help solve Poisson equations. Let $f$ be a harmonic function, and suppose it yields a separation of variables as $f(r,\\theta)=F(r)\\Theta(\\theta)$ . Then $F$ complies with a radial equation, and $\\Theta$ is called a spherical harmonic function. These functions are essential in, say, quantum mechanics. In general, $f$ can be expressed as $$\nf=\\sum_nF_n\\Theta_n,\n$$ where each $F_n$ complies with a radial equation, and each $\\Theta_n$ is a spherical harmonic function. This expression can be obtained by solving the Laplace equation by separation of variables.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original question is about proving that the only rotationally invariant second-order homogeneous PDE in two dimensions with constant coefficients is of the form a∇²u = bu. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions from the problem. The problem mentions several conditions:\n\n1. The PDE is second-order.\n2. It is homogeneous.\n3. It has constant coefficients.\n4. It is in two dimensions.\n5. It is rotationally invariant.\n\nEach of these should be a separate assumption. The problem statement in the original question is to show that the only such PDE is a∇²u = bu. \n\nLooking at the example provided, each assumption is listed line by line. So I should list each condition applied to the PDE. Let me check the user's example again. In the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions are about the PDE's properties. \n\nThe problem is to prove that among all such PDEs, the only ones invariant under rotation are of the form a∇²u = bu. \n\nI need to make sure that the assumptions are only about the problem's conditions, not the steps in the proof provided. The user's own proof in the question includes transformations and equations, but those are part of their solution, not the problem's assumptions. \n\nSo the assumptions should be:\n\n- The PDE is second-order.\n- The PDE is homogeneous.\n- The PDE has constant coefficients.\n- The PDE is in two dimensions.\n- The PDE is invariant under rotation of the coordinate system.\n\nEach of these is a separate line under Assumption. Then the Problem is to show that such PDEs must have the form a∇²u = bu.\n\nWait, the original problem statement in the question says: \"Among all second-order homogeneous PDEs in two dimensions with constant coefficients, show that the only ones that do not change under a rotation of the coordinate system (i.e., are rotationally invariant), have the form a∇²u = bu.\"\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n1. The PDE is second-order.\n2. The PDE is homogeneous.\n3. The PDE has constant coefficients.\n4. The PDE is in two dimensions.\n5. The PDE is invariant under rotation (rotationally invariant).\n\nEach of these is a separate line. Then the problem is to show that such PDEs must have the form a∇²u = bu.\n\nI need to verify that there's no other hidden assumption. The problem mentions \"homogeneous\" which in PDE terms usually means that all terms are of the same order, but here since it's a PDE, homogeneous might mean that the equation equals zero (like linear homogeneous). But the user's own proof uses \"homogeneous\" in the sense that the equation is homogeneous (i.e., equals zero) and the coefficients are constants. So the assumptions are correctly listed as second-order, homogeneous, constant coefficients, two-dimensional, and rotationally invariant.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have these five assumptions, each on a separate line, and the problem statement as given.",
