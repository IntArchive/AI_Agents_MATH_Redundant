If $M$ is a closed subspace and $x\\in\\mathcal{X}\\setminus M$ then $M + \\mathbb{C}x$ is closed. (Use Theorem 5.8a.)). b.) Every finite-dimensional subspace of $\\mathcal{X}$ is closed. Proof a.) - Let $M$ be a proper closed subspace of $X$ and let $x\\in X\\setminus M$ . There existts $f\\in X^*$ such that $f(x)\\neq 0$ and $f(M) = \\{0\\}$ . Let $\\{u_n + a_nx \\}_{1}^{\\infty}$ be a sequence in $M + Kx$ that converges to $y\\in X$ . Then $$f(y) = \\lim\\limits_{n\\rightarrow \\infty}f(u_n + a_n x) = \\lim\\limits_{n\\rightarrow \\infty} a_nf(x)$$ since $f$ is continuous, so $\\{a_n\\}_{1}^{\\infty}$ converges to $a:= f(y)/f(x)$ , which implies that $\\{a_nx \\}_{1}^{\\infty}$ converges to $ax$ .

Repeating the argument enough times, we have that $M + \\mathbb{C}e_1+\\ldots+\\mathbb{C}e_n$ is a closed subspace of $X$ . But $M + \\mathbb{C}e_1+\\ldots+\\mathbb{C}e_n=Y$ .

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement from the original question.\n\nLooking at the original question, part b) is about proving that every finite-dimensional subspace of a normed vector space is closed. The problem mentions using part a), which involves closed subspaces and adding a complex multiple of a vector not in the subspace. \n\nThe assumptions here would be the properties given about the space and the subspaces. The normed vector space is given, so that's one assumption. The key point for finite-dimensional subspaces is that each is built by adding vectors one by one, each time maintaining closedness. Since part a) states that if you have a closed subspace M and a vector x not in M, then M + ℂx is closed, we can use induction. The base case would be a zero-dimensional subspace, which is trivially closed. Then, assuming a k-dimensional subspace is closed, adding another vector (as in part a) keeps it closed. So the main assumptions are that the space is a normed vector space and each step of adding a vector to a closed subspace results in a closed subspace. However, the problem doesn't explicitly state additional conditions beyond the space being normed. So the only assumption is that the space is a normed vector space. The problem is to prove that every finite-dimensional subspace within it is closed. \n\nWait, but part a) is used in the proof. Should that be considered an assumption? The problem says \"Use Theorem 5.8a\", which in the original context is part of the problem's given background. Since the user wants the assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object, the main assumption here is that the space is a normed vector space. The problem then is part b), to show every finite-dimensional subspace is closed. The instructions mention filtering unrelated info, so we should focus on part b) specifically. The original problem includes part a) and b), but the user's example only formatted one part. So perhaps the user wants part b) here. The problem statement in the example included the theorem reference, but here the problem part is to prove every finite-dimension subspace is closed, using part a). However, the user's format example didn't include references to other theorems as assumptions, only the problem's own conditions. Therefore, the assumption here is simply that the space is a normed vector space. The problem is to prove that every finite-dimensional subspace is closed. The other info about part a) is part of the question's context but not an assumption. So the formatted problem should list the normed vector space as the assumption and the problem as part b).",
