    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that the infinite sum of 1/(n² + 7n + 9) from n=0 to infinity equals 1 plus (π/sqrt(13)) times the tangent of (sqrt(13)π/2). \n\nFirst, I need to recall methods for summing such series. The general form 1/(n² + an + b) often relates to the Basel problem or Fourier series, but here partial fractions didn't work. Maybe completing the square in the denominator would help. Let's try that. \n\nThe denominator is n² + 7n + 9. Completing the square: n² + 7n + (49/4) - (49/4) + 9 = (n + 7/2)² - 13/4. So the term becomes 1/[(n + 7/2)² - (sqrt(13)/2)²]. That resembles the form 1/(k² - a²), which can be expressed using partial fractions as 1/(2a)[1/(k - a) - 1/(k + a)]. \n\nApplying this, maybe the series can be telescoped? But since it's an infinite sum, telescoping might not directly apply. Alternatively, I remember that sums of 1/(n² + a²) relate to hyperbolic functions or the cotangent function via the Poisson summation formula or residue theorems. Wait, the given answer involves a tangent function, which is similar to cotangent but with a phase shift. \n\nThe standard formula for the sum from n=0 to infinity of 1/(n² + a²) is (1/(2a²))[1 + aπ coth(aπ)] or something like that. But here the denominator is (n + c)² + d². Maybe shifting the index? Let me adjust the index. Let m = n + 7/2 - something. Wait, after completing the square, the denominator is (n + 7/2)² - (sqrt(13)/2)^2. But that's a difference of squares, not a sum. So maybe hyperbolic functions instead? Hmm, but the answer has a tangent, which is a circular function. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the residue theorem from complex analysis. The sum over integers of a function can sometimes be evaluated using residues involving pi cot(pi z) multiplied by the function. Let's consider that approach. \n\nLet’s recall the formula for the sum from n=-infty to infty of f(n) can be computed as -sum residues of pi cot(pi z) f(z) at the poles of f(z). But here the sum starts at n=0. So we can write the sum from n=0 to infty as 1/2 [sum from n=-infty to infty f(n) + f(0)] if the function is even or adjust accordingly. Wait, our function after completing the square is 1/[(n + 7/2)^2 - (sqrt(13)/2)^2]. Let me shift the index: let m = n + 7/2. Then n = m - 7/2. But n starts at 0, so m starts at 7/2. Hmm, but m must be integer? No, m would be a half-integer. That complicates things. \n\nAlternatively, maybe express the sum as starting from m = 7/2, but since m must be integers, perhaps splitting the sum into two parts: one from n=0 to n=3 (since 7/2 is 3.5) and then from n=4 onwards? Not sure. \n\nWait, another approach: using the digamma function. The sum can be expressed in terms of the digamma function, which relates to the series sum 1/(n + a) = psi(a) + gamma. But our denominator is quadratic. However, partial fractions might decompose it into terms involving 1/(n + a) - 1/(n + b). Let's try that. \n\nGiven the denominator (n + 7/2)^2 - (sqrt(13)/2)^2, factor it as [n + 7/2 - sqrt(13)/2][n + 7/2 + sqrt(13)/2]. So we can write 1/[ (n + alpha)(n + beta) ] where alpha = (7 - sqrt(13))/2 and beta = (7 + sqrt(13))/2. Then partial fractions would give [1/(beta - alpha)] [1/(n + alpha) - 1/(n + beta)]. Since beta - alpha is sqrt(13). So the term becomes 1/sqrt(13) [1/(n + alpha) - 1/(n + beta)]. \n\nThen the sum becomes 1/sqrt(13) [sum_{n=0}^infty 1/(n + alpha) - 1/(n + beta) ]. But this is a telescoping series? However, since both terms are infinite, the difference would be the difference between two divergent series. But perhaps when subtracted, they converge. \n\nRecall that the sum from n=0 to infinity of [1/(n + a) - 1/(n + b)] = psi(b) - psi(a), using the properties of the digamma function. But I need to relate this to the tangent function. The digamma function has a reflection formula: psi(1 - z) - psi(z) = pi cot(pi z). Maybe using that. \n\nGiven alpha and beta: let's check if beta = 1 - alpha. Let’s compute alpha + beta = (7 - sqrt(13))/2 + (7 + sqrt(13))/2 = 14/2 =7. So alpha + beta =7, so beta =7 - alpha. Not exactly 1 - alpha, unless 7 - alpha =1 - alpha, which isn't. Hmm. \n\nBut maybe we can express the difference psi(beta) - psi(alpha). Since beta =7 - alpha, maybe there's a relation. Alternatively, consider shifting the index. Let’s write the sum S =1/sqrt(13)[sum_{n=0}^\\infty 1/(n + alpha) - 1/(n + beta)].\n\nChanging variables in the second sum: let m =n + beta - alpha. Wait, beta - alpha = sqrt(13). So m =n + sqrt(13). Then n =m - sqrt(13). But sqrt(13) is irrational, so m isn't an integer. This complicates the shift. \n\nAlternatively, recall that the digamma function satisfies psi(z+1) = psi(z) +1/z. So maybe express the sum in terms of psi(alpha) and psi(beta). The sum from n=0 to infinity 1/(n + alpha) is psi(alpha) + gamma, where gamma is Euler-Mascheroni. Similarly for the other term. So S =1/sqrt(13)[psi(beta) - psi(alpha)]. \n\nNow, using the reflection formula for digamma: psi(1 - z) - psi(z) = pi cot(pi z). But here we have psi(beta) - psi(alpha). Since alpha + beta =7, as we saw earlier, beta=7 - alpha. Suppose we can relate this to the reflection formula. Let’s set z=alpha. Then psi(1 - alpha) - psi(alpha) = pi cot(pi alpha). But beta=7 - alpha, so 1 - alpha = beta -6. Not directly helpful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe use the recurrence relation: psi(z +n) = psi(z) + sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 1/(z +k). Let's try to express psi(beta) in terms of psi(alpha). Since beta =7 - alpha, maybe shift the argument. Let’s compute beta = (7 + sqrt(13))/2. Then 7 - beta = (14 -7 - sqrt(13))/2 = (7 - sqrt(13))/2 = alpha. So beta =7 - alpha. Therefore, psi(beta) = psi(7 - alpha). \n\nThere's a formula for psi(7 - alpha) in terms of psi(alpha). The general formula for psi(m - z) where m is integer might involve a summation. For example, psi(1 - z) = psi(z) + pi cot(pi z). For higher integers, like psi(2 - z) = psi(z) + pi cot(pi z) +1/(1 - z). This might get complicated. Since 7 is a large integer, perhaps it's better to use the reflection formula multiple times. \n\nAlternatively, recall that the given answer involves tan(sqrt(13) pi/2). The argument inside tan is sqrt(13) pi /2. Let's note that if we have a term like cot(pi alpha), and alpha = (7 - sqrt(13))/2, then pi alpha = (7/2 - sqrt(13)/2) pi. Then 7/2 pi is 3pi + pi/2, so cot(pi alpha) = cot(3pi + pi/2 - sqrt(13) pi /2) = cot(pi/2 - sqrt(13) pi /2 +3pi). But cot(x +3pi) = cot(x), and cot(pi/2 -x) = tan x. So cot(pi alpha) = tan(sqrt(13) pi /2). \n\nLet me verify that step. Let’s compute pi alpha = pi*(7 - sqrt(13))/2 = (7pi/2) - (sqrt(13) pi)/2. 7pi/2 is 3pi + pi/2, so pi alpha = 3pi + pi/2 - (sqrt(13) pi)/2. So cot(pi alpha) = cot(3pi + pi/2 - (sqrt(13) pi)/2). Since cot is periodic with period pi, cot(3pi + x) = cot x. So cot(3pi + pi/2 - sqrt(13) pi/2) = cot(pi/2 - sqrt(13) pi/2). And cot(pi/2 -x) = tan x. Therefore, cot(pi alpha) = tan(sqrt(13) pi/2). \n\nTherefore, if we can express the difference psi(beta) - psi(alpha) in terms of cot(pi alpha), we can relate it to tan(sqrt(13) pi/2). \n\nFrom the reflection formula, psi(1 - z) - psi(z) = pi cot(pi z). Let’s set z = alpha. Then psi(1 - alpha) - psi(alpha) = pi cot(pi alpha) = pi tan(sqrt(13) pi/2). But how does this relate to psi(beta) - psi(alpha)? \n\nWe know that beta =7 - alpha. Let’s express psi(beta) = psi(7 - alpha). Using the recurrence relation of the digamma function: psi(7 - alpha) = psi(6 - alpha) + 1/(6 - alpha). Continuing this recursively:\n\npsi(7 - alpha) = psi(1 - alpha) + sum_{k=0}^{6 -1} 1/(k +1 - alpha) = psi(1 - alpha) + sum_{m=1}^{6} 1/(m - alpha).\n\nTherefore, psi(beta) = psi(1 - alpha) + sum_{m=1}^6 1/(m - alpha).\n\nThus, the difference psi(beta) - psi(alpha) = [psi(1 - alpha) - psi(alpha)] + sum_{m=1}^6 1/(m - alpha).\n\nFrom the reflection formula, psi(1 - alpha) - psi(alpha) = pi cot(pi alpha) = pi tan(sqrt(13) pi/2). \n\nTherefore, psi(beta) - psi(alpha) = pi tan(sqrt(13) pi/2) + sum_{m=1}^6 1/(m - alpha).\n\nNow, we need to compute this sum from m=1 to 6 of 1/(m - alpha). Recall that alpha = (7 - sqrt(13))/2. So m - alpha = m - (7 - sqrt(13))/2 = (2m -7 + sqrt(13))/2. Let's compute each term:\n\nFor m=1: (2*1 -7 + sqrt(13))/2 = (-5 + sqrt(13))/2. Term: 2/(-5 + sqrt(13)) = [2*(-5 - sqrt(13))]/[25 -13] = (-10 - 2 sqrt(13))/12 = (-5 - sqrt(13))/6.\n\nSimilarly for m=2: (4 -7 + sqrt(13))/2 = (-3 + sqrt(13))/2. Term: 2/(-3 + sqrt(13)) = 2*(-3 - sqrt(13))/(9 -13) = (-6 -2 sqrt(13))/(-4) = (3 + sqrt(13))/2.\n\nm=3: (6 -7 + sqrt(13))/2 = (-1 + sqrt(13))/2. Term: 2/(-1 + sqrt(13)) = 2*(-1 - sqrt(13))/(1 -13) = (-2 -2 sqrt(13))/(-12) = (1 + sqrt(13))/6.\n\nm=4: (8 -7 + sqrt(13))/2 = (1 + sqrt(13))/2. Term: 2/(1 + sqrt(13)) = 2*(1 - sqrt(13))/(1 -13) = (2 -2 sqrt(13))/(-12) = (-1 + sqrt(13))/6.\n\nm=5: (10 -7 + sqrt(13))/2 = (3 + sqrt(13))/2. Term: 2/(3 + sqrt(13)) = 2*(3 - sqrt(13))/(9 -13) = (6 -2 sqrt(13))/(-4) = (-3 + sqrt(13))/2.\n\nm=6: (12 -7 + sqrt(13))/2 = (5 + sqrt(13))/2. Term: 2/(5 + sqrt(13)) = 2*(5 - sqrt(13))/(25 -13) = (10 -2 sqrt(13))/12 = (5 - sqrt(13))/6.\n\nNow summing all these terms:\n\nm=1: (-5 - sqrt(13))/6\n\nm=2: (3 + sqrt(13))/2\n\nm=3: (1 + sqrt(13))/6\n\nm=4: (-1 + sqrt(13))/6\n\nm=5: (-3 + sqrt(13))/2\n\nm=6: (5 - sqrt(13))/6\n\nLet's add them step by step.\n\nFirst, m=1 and m=6:\n\n[(-5 - sqrt(13))/6 + (5 - sqrt(13))/6] = [(-5 +5) + (-sqrt(13) - sqrt(13))]/6 = (-2 sqrt(13))/6 = (-sqrt(13))/3\n\nNext, m=2 and m=5:\n\n[(3 + sqrt(13))/2 + (-3 + sqrt(13))/2] = [3 -3 + sqrt(13) + sqrt(13)]/2 = (2 sqrt(13))/2 = sqrt(13)\n\nNext, m=3 and m=4:\n\n[(1 + sqrt(13))/6 + (-1 + sqrt(13))/6] = [1 -1 + sqrt(13) + sqrt(13)]/6 = (2 sqrt(13))/6 = sqrt(13)/3\n\nNow sum all three parts:\n\n(-sqrt(13)/3) + sqrt(13) + (sqrt(13)/3) = [(-sqrt(13)/3 + sqrt(13)/3)] + sqrt(13) = 0 + sqrt(13) = sqrt(13)\n\nTherefore, the sum from m=1 to 6 of 1/(m - alpha) = sqrt(13).\n\nThus, psi(beta) - psi(alpha) = pi tan(sqrt(13) pi/2) + sqrt(13).\n\nThen, the original sum S =1/sqrt(13)[psi(beta) - psi(alpha)] =1/sqrt(13)[pi tan(sqrt(13) pi/2) + sqrt(13)] = pi/sqrt(13) tan(sqrt(13) pi/2) +1.\n\nBut wait, the problem states the sum equals 1 + (pi/sqrt(13)) tan(sqrt(13) pi/2), which matches. However, in the problem, the sum starts at n=0. When we did partial fractions, we considered the sum from n=0 to infinity. So this checks out.\n\nBut the user mentioned partial fraction didn't work. Maybe because they didn't consider the digamma function approach. Alternatively, there might be another method using Fourier series or contour integration, but this seems valid. \n\nSo the key steps are: complete the square, partial fraction decomposition into terms involving 1/(n + alpha) -1/(n + beta), recognize the sum as a difference of digamma functions, apply the reflection formula and recurrence relations to simplify, and compute the resulting terms. The final result matches the given expression. \n\nTherefore, the assumptions are about the convergence of the series and the applicability of the digamma function properties, but since the problem is presented as is, the main assumption is that the sum starts at n=0 and goes to infinity. The problem is to evaluate this sum and show it equals the given expression involving pi and tangent.",
