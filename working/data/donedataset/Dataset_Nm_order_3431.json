    "AcceptedAnswer": "(1) can actually be generalized to show that no entire function $f$ can dominate another entire function $g$ unless $g = \\lambda f$ for some constant $\\lambda$. Let $Z(f)$ be the set of zeros of $f$. If $|g| \\le |f|$, then:\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{g(z)}{f(z)}\\right| \\le 1 \\quad \\forall z \\in \\Bbb C - Z(f)\n$$ But $g/f$ is bounded in a deleted neighborhood of each $a \\in Z(f)$. Thus each $a \\in Z(f)$ is a removable singularity of $g/f$. Therefore $g/f$ is entire and bounded, hence constant by Liouville's theorem. It follows that $g = \\lambda f$. In your particular question, $f(z) = \\exp(z)$ and this function doesn't have any zeros, so it isn't necessary to discuss the zeros of $f$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to parse the original question correctly. The title mentions that an entire function dominated by another entire function is a constant multiple. Then, the question has two parts. \n\nThe first part says: Suppose f(z) is entire with |f(z)| ≤ |exp(z)| for every z. Prove that f(z) = k exp(z) for some |k| ≤ 1. The second part asks whether a non-constant entire function can be bounded in half a plane, and to prove or provide an example.\n\nBut according to the example provided, the formatted problem should split assumptions and the problem statement. The example shows that each assumption is a single condition applied to one object. So, for the first problem: f(z) is entire, and |f(z)| ≤ |exp(z)| for every z. Then the problem is to prove f(z) = k exp(z) with |k| ≤1.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, the assumptions are that f is entire and that |f(z)| ≤ |exp(z)| for all z. Each of these should be separate lines in the assumption section.\n\nThen the problem is to show that f(z) is a constant multiple of exp(z) with the constant's modulus ≤1.\n\nFor the second question: \"Can a non-constant entire function be bounded in half a plane? Prove if yes, example if not.\" Here, the assumption would be that the function is entire and non-constant, and that it's bounded in a half-plane. But the problem is to determine if this is possible, providing proof or a counterexample.\n\nBut wait, the user's example only structured one problem. The original question here has two separate questions. However, the user's instruction says \"the problem\" but the example includes only one. Maybe each question should be formatted separately. But the user's example combines both into one? Wait, looking back, the example given by the user was one problem. The original problem here has two questions. However, the user's instructions say \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange\" (singular). So perhaps the user intended to split each problem separately. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nOriginal problem: The user's question includes two parts. The first part is proving that f(z) = k exp(z) under the given conditions. The second part is about whether a non-constant entire function can be bounded in a half-plane. So these are two separate problems. Therefore, the assistant needs to structure each problem according to the format. However, the user's example only formatted one problem. So maybe each problem should be formatted separately. But the user's instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\", implying each problem is handled individually. \n\nSo perhaps, the assistant should split the two problems into two separate formatted entries. Let me check the user's example again. In the example, the original problem was a single problem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91. The user formatted that into one problem with assumptions and the problem statement. Therefore, for the current problem, which has two separate questions, the assistant should structure each of them as separate entries.\n\nTherefore, first problem: Entire function dominated by exp(z). Second problem: Non-constant entire function bounded in half-plane.\n\nStarting with the first problem.\n\nAssumptions: f(z) is entire. For every z, |f(z)| ≤ |exp(z)|.\n\nProblem: Prove that f(z) = k exp(z) for some constant k with |k| ≤ 1.\n\nFor the second problem:\n\nAssumptions: f(z) is entire. f(z) is non-constant. f(z) is bounded in a half-plane.\n\nProblem: Determine if such a function exists. If yes, provide a proof; if not, give an example.\n\nWait, but the second problem is phrased as a question: \"Can a non-constant entire function be bounded in half a plane? Prove if yes, example if not.\" So the assumptions here are: f is entire, non-constant, and bounded in a half-plane. The problem is to determine existence. However, according to the problem statement, the answer is \"no\" based on Liouville's theorem. Because if a function is entire and bounded in the entire complex plane, it's constant. But being bounded in a half-plane doesn't necessarily require the function to be constant. Wait, but maybe there's a theorem that says an entire function bounded in a half-plane must be constant? Wait, I think that's not the case. For example, e^z is bounded in the left half-plane (Re(z) ≤ 0), but it's not constant. Wait, but e^z is unbounded in the right half-plane. Wait, e^z in the left half-plane: when Re(z) ≤ 0, |e^z| = e^{Re(z)} ≤ 1. So e^z is bounded in the left half-plane. However, e^z is entire but non-constant. So that would be a counterexample: e^z is entire, non-constant, and bounded in the left half-plane. Therefore, the answer is yes, such functions exist, and the example is e^z. Therefore, the problem's answer is yes, and the example is e^z. Hence, the problem is to prove that yes, and give an example. But in the original problem, the user says: \"Prove if yes , example if not.\" So if the answer is yes, you need to prove it; if not, provide an example. Wait, but in this case, the answer is yes, so you need to prove that it's possible, and give an example. Wait, the original question says \"Can a non-constant entire function be bounded in half a plane? Prove if yes , example if not.\" So if the answer is yes, you need to prove that it's possible (i.e., existence), perhaps by example. Wait, the phrasing is a bit unclear. But the example of e^z shows that yes, such functions exist. Therefore, the answer is yes, and an example is e^z. Therefore, for the problem, the assumptions would be: f(z) is entire, f(z) is non-constant, and f(z) is bounded in a half-plane. But actually, the problem is asking whether such a function can exist. So the problem is: \"Can a non-constant entire function be bounded in a half-plane? Prove if yes, example if not.\" Therefore, the structured problem would have assumptions: f(z) is entire, f(z) is non-constant, f(z) is bounded in a half-plane. But perhaps the problem is whether such a function exists. So the problem is to determine if there exists a non-constant entire function bounded in a half-plane, and prove or provide a counterexample. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: f(z) is entire,\nf(z) is non-constant,\nf(z) is bounded in a half-plane.\n\nProblem: Determine whether such a function exists. If yes, provide an example; if not, prove its impossibility.\n\nBut the original question is phrased as \"Can a non-constant entire function be bounded in half a plane? Prove if yes , example if not.\" So the problem is asking for existence. Therefore, the problem statement is the question, and the assumptions are the conditions. So in the format:\n\nAssumption: f(z) is entire,\nf(z) is non-constant,\nf(z) is bounded in a half-plane.\n\nProblem: Can such a function exist? If yes, provide an example; if not, prove it cannot exist.\n\nBut according to the example, the problem line is the statement to prove. However, in this case, the problem is a question. The user's example had \"Prove that ... is divisible by 91.\" So perhaps for the second problem, the problem line should be: \"Can a non-constant entire function be bounded in a half-plane? If yes, provide an example; if not, prove it.\"\n\nBut the user's format requires the problem to be a statement. However, the example had a problem line that was a command (\"Prove that...\"). So maybe the second problem can be phrased as: \"Determine whether a non-constant entire function can be bounded in a half-plane. If yes, provide an example; if not, prove it.\"\n\nTherefore, structuring each problem separately. However, the user's original input has both questions in one post. But according to the instructions, the assistant should structure \"the problem\" as per the format. But in the original post, there are two distinct problems. Therefore, the assistant might need to structure each problem separately. But the user's example only includes one problem. So perhaps the user wants each individual problem to be formatted. Therefore, the answer should have two formatted entries.\n\nBut the user's answer format requires \"BEGIN_OF_FORMAT\" and then the structured problem. However, the user's example only shows one problem. Therefore, perhaps the assistant should handle each problem separately. But the user hasn't specified. Maybe in this case, the user expects both problems to be formatted as two separate entries. However, given the original instructions, perhaps the answer should include both formatted problems in sequence, each under ###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended each of the two questions in the original post to be formatted as per the example. So the first formatted problem is the first question, the second formatted problem is the second question. Let me check the original problem again:\n\nOriginal problem on Math Stack Exchange:\nTitle: Entire function dominated by another entire function is a constant multiple\nQuestion: These two questions I didn't even find the way to solve So please if you can help Suppose f(z) is entire with |f(z)| ≤ |exp(z)| for every z I want to prove that f(z) = k exp(z) for some |k| ≤1. Can a non-constant entire function be bounded in half a plane? Prove if yes, example if not.\n\nSo the user has two distinct questions. Therefore, each should be formatted as per the example.\n\nFirst problem:\n\nAssumption: f(z) is entire,\nFor every z, |f(z)| ≤ |exp(z)|.\n\nProblem: Prove that f(z) = k exp(z) for some constant k with |k| ≤ 1.\n\nSecond problem:\n\nAssumption: f(z) is entire,\nf(z) is non-constant,\nf(z) is bounded in a half-plane.\n\nProblem: Determine whether such a function exists. If yes, provide an example; if not, prove its impossibility.\n\nBut in the example, the problem line is a statement to prove. The second problem here is a bit different, as it's a yes/no question. However, according to the user's instruction, the problem line should be the problem statement. Therefore, for the second problem, the problem line would be: \"Can a non-constant entire function be bounded in a half-plane? Prove if yes, provide an example if not.\"\n\nBut the example given by the user used a command (\"Prove that...\"), so maybe the problem line should be phrased as a command. However, the original question is a yes/no question. Therefore, perhaps the problem line should be: \"Determine whether a non-constant entire function can be bounded in a half-plane. If yes, provide an example; if not, prove it.\"\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be: \"Prove or disprove: A non-constant entire function can be bounded in a half-plane.\"\n\nBut given the user's example, the problem line is a statement to prove. However, in this case, the problem is more of a question. Therefore, adapting it to fit the format, perhaps:\n\nProblem: Prove whether a non-constant entire function can be bounded in a half-plane. If possible, provide an example; otherwise, prove impossibility.\n\nBut this is getting a bit wordy. Alternatively, follow the exact wording of the original question, as the user might prefer that.\n\nOriginal problem's second part: \"Can a non-constant entire function be bounded in half a plane? Prove if yes, example if not.\"\n\nTherefore, the problem line should be exactly that.\n\nBut according to the example, the problem line is the problem statement. So the user's example took the original problem's main question and restructured it, keeping the command (\"Prove that...\").\n\nIn this case, the second problem is a question, so the problem line would be: \"Can a non-constant entire function be bounded in a half-plane? Prove if yes, example if not.\"\n\nThus, the formatted problems would be:\n\nFor the first question:\n\nAssumption:\nf(z) is entire,\nFor every z, |f(z)| ≤ |exp(z)|.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f(z) = k exp(z) for some constant k with |k| ≤ 1.\n\nFor the second question:\n\nAssumption:\nf(z) is entire,\nf(z) is non-constant,\nf(z) is bounded in a half-plane.\n\nProblem:\nCan a non-constant entire function be bounded in a half-plane? Prove if yes, example if not.\n\nBut in the assumption, \"f(z) is bounded in a half-plane\" is part of the problem's condition. However, the problem is asking whether such a function exists. So if the problem is to determine existence under those conditions, the assumptions are that f is entire, non-constant, and bounded in a half-plane. But actually, the problem is whether such a function exists, so the assumptions are the conditions that the function must satisfy. Therefore, the assumptions are correct as above.\n\nBut wait, when structuring the problem, the assumptions are the given conditions, and the problem is the question to answer. In the example, the assumptions were the given conditions (n is an integer, divisible by 7), and the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nSimilarly, here, for the second question, the assumptions are that f is entire, non-constant, and bounded in a half-plane. The problem is to determine if such a function can exist (i.e., whether these conditions can all be true simultaneously). So the problem is asking for the possibility, hence the question.\n\nTherefore, the formatted answer for each problem is as follows.",
