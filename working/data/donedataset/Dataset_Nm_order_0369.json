    "AcceptedAnswer": "I don't know what proof of Steinhaus theorem is used, but we can show the following result: If $A$ and $B$ have a positive Lebesgue measure, then $A+B$ contains an interval. We can assume that $A$ and $B$ have finite measure. Indeed, if $\\lambda(A)$ is infinite, $A=\\bigcup_{n\\in\\mathbb N}A\\cap\\left[-n,n\\right]$ and we only have to pick $n_0$ such that $\\lambda(A\\cap \\left[-n_0,n_0\\right])>0$. If $n_1$ is such that $\\lambda(B\\cap \\left[-n_1,n_1\\right])>0$, and we have shown the result for $A$ and $B$ of finite measure, then $A+B\\supset (A\\cap \\left[-n_0,n_0\\right])+(B\\cap \\left[-n_1,n_1\\right])\\supset I$ and we are done. Thank to the fact the indicator functions are in $L^2$ and the density of the continuous functions with compact support in $L^2(\\mathbb R)$\n$$f\\colon x\\mapsto \\mathbf{1}_A*\\mathbf{1}_B(x)=\\int_{\\mathbb R}\\mathbf{1}_A(x-t)\\mathbf {1}_B(t)d\\lambda(t)$$\nis continuous .\n Hence the set $O:=\\left\\{x\\in\\mathbb R,f(x)>0\\right\\}$ is open.

Indeed, if $y\\in A\\cap(-B+x)$ then $y=a$ for some $a\\in A$, and $y=-b+x$ for some $b\\in B$, hence $x=a+b$.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, the question is about proving that if A is a set of positive Lebesgue measure, then A + A contains an interval. The user mentions Stromberg and Steinhaus' Theorem, so I recall that Steinhaus' theorem usually states that if two sets have positive measure, their sumset contains an open interval. But here it's about A + A, which is a special case when both sets are the same.\n\nFirst, I need to remember the original Steinhaus proof. The classic approach, I think, involves using the Lebesgue density theorem. You take a point of density for A, which exists because A has positive measure. Then, you consider small intervals around that point where A has density close to 1. Then, by translating or scaling, you show that the differences (or sums) must cover an interval.\n\nWait, but the problem is about the sumset A + A. The original Steinhaus theorem might be about A - A containing an interval, or A + B when both have positive measure. Let me verify. Yes, Steinhaus theorem typically says that if A and B have positive measure, then A + B contains an open interval. So in this case, since A has positive measure, then A + A should contain an interval. The user is asking how to modify the Steinhaus proof for this case.\n\nSo, in the original proof for A and B, you might use convolution of their characteristic functions, or use measure-theoretic arguments. Let me think. One approach is to use the fact that the measure of A + A is larger than the measure of A, but I need to be precise.\n\nAlternatively, consider that for a set A with positive measure, there exists a point x such that the density of A at x is 1. Then, for sufficiently small ε, the intersection of A with (x - ε, x + ε) has measure close to 2ε. Then, when you add A to itself, the points around 2x would be covered by sums of points from A near x. But I need to formalize this.\n\nWait, another approach is to use the continuity of the convolution of the characteristic functions of A. Since the convolution will be continuous, and it's non-zero at some point, hence it's non-zero in an interval, implying that A + A contains that interval.\n\nBut maybe the standard Steinhaus proof for A - A: take a density point a of A, then for small h, the measure of A ∩ (a - h, a + h) is almost 2h. Then, the set A - A contains (-h, h) because for any y in (-h, h), the sets A ∩ (a - h, a + h) and y + A ∩ (a - h, a + h) must intersect, which implies y = a1 - a2 for some a1, a2 in A. But how does that translate to A + A?\n\nAlternatively, instead of considering a - a', we can consider a + a'. So, perhaps pick a density point a, then look at A ∩ (a - h, a + h). Then, the sumset would be (A ∩ (a - h, a + h)) + (A ∩ (a - h, a + h)) which would be (2a - 2h, 2a + 2h). For sufficiently small h, this sumset should cover an interval around 2a. Because the measure of each set is almost 2h, so the sumset's measure is roughly 4h^2? Wait, no, the measure of the sumset can't be directly calculated like that. But by the Brunn-Minkowski inequality, maybe. But perhaps in this case, using the same idea as Steinhaus.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that if A has positive measure, then there exists an open set U such that U is contained in A - A. Wait, but that's the original Steinhaus theorem. For the sumset A + A, maybe the approach is similar. Let me check the standard steps:\n\n1. Since A has positive measure, there exists a point x where the density of A is 1. So, for any ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for all r < δ, the measure of A ∩ (x - r, x + r) > (1 - ε)(2r).\n\n2. Choose ε small enough, say ε = 1/2. Then, for sufficiently small r, the measure of A ∩ (x - r, x + r) > r.\n\n3. Now, consider the sumset (A ∩ (x - r, x + r)) + (A ∩ (x - r, x + r)). The sumset would be in (2x - 2r, 2x + 2r). We need to show that this sumset contains an interval around 2x.\n\n4. Suppose there's a point y in (2x - 2r, 2x + 2r). Then y = a + b where a, b ∈ A ∩ (x - r, x + r). To show that such a and b exist for every y in some interval.\n\nAlternatively, using measure theory, if the sumset didn't contain an interval, then the convolution of the characteristic functions of A would be zero in some neighborhood, but convolution of two L^2 functions is continuous, hence if it's non-zero somewhere, it's non-zero in an interval. Since the integral of the convolution at a point is the measure of A intersect (y - A), which for some y would be positive. Therefore, convolution is non-zero, hence continuous, so there's an interval where it's non-zero, implying that y ∈ A + A for all y in that interval.\n\nAlternatively, maybe more elementary: By the Lebesgue density theorem, take a density point a of A. For small enough h, the measure of A in (a - h, a + h) is greater than (1 - ε)2h. Then, consider the set A + A. For any t near 2a, we can write t = a1 + a2, where a1 and a2 are in A. If we set t = 2a + s, where s is small, then we need to find a1 and a2 such that a1 + a2 = 2a + s. Let a1 = a + u and a2 = a + v. Then, u + v = s. We need to show that there exist u and v such that a + u ∈ A and a + v ∈ A. Equivalently, u and v must satisfy that u ∈ A - a and v ∈ A - a, and u + v = s. So, this reduces to showing that (A - a) + (A - a) contains an interval around 0. But since a is a density point of A, A - a has 0 as a density point. Then, the sumset of a set with itself around 0 contains an interval. This seems similar to the standard Steinhaus proof where you shift the set to have 0 as a density point and then show the sumset covers a neighborhood of 0.\n\nSo, modifying the original Steinhaus proof for A + A:\n\n1. Let A have positive measure. Find a density point a of A.\n\n2. Let ε = 1/4. Then there exists h > 0 such that the measure of A ∩ (a - h, a + h) > (1 - ε)2h = (3/2)h.\n\n3. Let’s consider the translated set B = A - a. Then 0 is a density point of B, and the measure of B ∩ (-h, h) > (3/2)h.\n\n4. We need to show that B + B contains an interval around 0. Take any s with |s| < h/2. We need to show that there exist x, y ∈ B such that x + y = s.\n\n5. Suppose not. Then, for some s, there are no x, y ∈ B such that x + y = s. Which implies that B ∩ (s - B) = ∅. But s - B is the set {s - y | y ∈ B}. \n\n6. The measure of B ∩ (-h, h) is greater than (3/2)h. Similarly, s - B ∩ (-h, h) would have the same measure as B ∩ (s - (-h, h)) which is (s - h, s + h). But if |s| < h/2, then (s - h, s + h) contains (-h/2 - h, h/2 + h) = (-3h/2, 3h/2). Wait, maybe this approach isn't straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, since B has high density near 0, then B + B must contain an interval. Because if not, then B and s - B are disjoint for some s. Then, the measure of B ∪ (s - B) would be measure(B) + measure(s - B) = 2 * measure(B). But if B is contained in (-h, h), then s - B is in (s - h, s + h). If |s| < h, then the union B ∪ (s - B) is contained in (-h - |s|, h + |s|). If |s| < h, then the union is in (-2h, 2h). But the measure of the union would be 2 * measure(B). If 2 * measure(B) > measure((-2h, 2h)) = 4h, then we have a contradiction. But measure(B) > (3/2)h, so 2 * measure(B) > 3h. But 4h > 3h, so that doesn't give a contradiction. Hmm, maybe this isn't the right way.\n\nAlternatively, using the inner regularity of Lebesgue measure, we can take a compact subset K of A with positive measure. Then, K + K is compact, being the sum of compact sets. Then, the measure of K + K is positive, and since it's a closed set, it contains an interval. Wait, is that true? Not sure. The sum of two compact sets is compact, but even if K has positive measure, K + K might not necessarily contain an interval. For example, the Cantor set has measure zero, and its sumset is the interval [0, 2]. But if K has positive measure, maybe K + K does contain an interval. That's what we're trying to prove.\n\nAnother approach: Use the fact that the convolution of the characteristic function of A with itself is continuous. Since A has positive measure, then χ_A * χ_A is continuous, and non-zero somewhere. Therefore, it's non-zero in an interval, which would imply that A + A contains that interval.\n\nLet me elaborate. The convolution χ_A * χ_A(y) = ∫ χ_A(t)χ_A(y - t) dt = measure(A ∩ (y - A)). If this is positive, then y ∈ A + A. If the convolution is continuous and not identically zero, then there must be an interval where it's positive, hence A + A contains that interval.\n\nSo, since A has positive measure, there exists some y where measure(A ∩ (y - A)) > 0. Therefore, χ_A * χ_A(y) > 0. But the convolution of two L^1 functions is continuous. Hence, χ_A * χ_A is continuous, so there is an interval around y where it's positive, implying A + A contains that interval.\n\nWait, but does the convolution of two L^1 functions have to be continuous? Yes, in L^1, the convolution of two L^1 functions is continuous. So, since χ_A is in L^1 (because A has finite measure), then χ_A * χ_A is continuous. Therefore, if it's positive at some point, it's positive in a neighborhood of that point, hence A + A contains that neighborhood.\n\nBut how do we know that the convolution is positive at some point? Because if A has positive measure, then there exists some y such that A ∩ (y - A) has positive measure. For example, take y such that both A and y - A overlap on a set of positive measure. In particular, taking y = 0, but A might not necessarily intersect with -A. Alternatively, take y to be such that A and y - A overlap. Since A has positive measure, for almost every y, A ∩ (y - A) has positive measure. Wait, actually, by the convolution theorem, the integral of χ_A * χ_A over all y is (measure(A))^2. So, if measure(A) > 0, then the integral is positive, hence the convolution is positive on a set of positive measure. But since it's continuous, the set where it's positive is open, hence contains an interval.\n\nTherefore, the steps are:\n\n1. A has positive Lebesgue measure.\n\n2. The convolution χ_A * χ_A is continuous.\n\n3. The integral of χ_A * χ_A over ℝ is (measure(A))^2 > 0.\n\n4. Therefore, there exists a point y where χ_A * χ_A(y) > 0.\n\n5. Since it's continuous, there's an interval around y where χ_A * χ_A > 0.\n\n6. Hence, A + A contains that interval.\n\nTherefore, the problem can be approached using the convolution argument, which shows that A + A contains an interval. This seems to be a valid approach. So, the answer would involve explaining this method, using the convolution and its continuity to establish the existence of an interval in the sumset.\n\nAlternatively, going back to the density point approach. Let me try to outline that method again.\n\n1. Let A be a set with positive measure. By Lebesgue's density theorem, almost every point of A is a density point. Choose a density point a of A.\n\n2. For ε = 1/2, there exists δ > 0 such that for all 0 < h < δ, measure(A ∩ (a - h, a + h)) > (1 - ε) * 2h = h.\n\n3. Let’s consider h sufficiently small so that this holds. Let’s define B = A - a, so 0 is a density point of B.\n\n4. Then, measure(B ∩ (-h, h)) > h.\n\n5. We want to show that B + B contains an interval around 0. Let’s take any s with |s| < h/2.\n\n6. Suppose for contradiction that s is not in B + B. Then, B ∩ (s - B) = ∅.\n\n7. However, measure(B ∩ (-h, h)) > h, and measure(s - B ∩ (-h, h)) = measure(B ∩ (s - (-h, h))) = measure(B ∩ (s - h, s + h)).\n\n8. Since |s| < h/2, the interval (s - h, s + h) contains (-h/2, h/2), and overlaps significantly with (-h, h). So, the measure of B ∩ (s - h, s + h)) is at least measure(B ∩ (-h/2, h/2)).\n\n9. But since 0 is a density point of B, for sufficiently small h, measure(B ∩ (-h/2, h/2)) is close to h. So, measure(B ∩ (s - h, s + h)) is at least something close to h.\n\n10. Then, measure(B ∩ (-h, h)) + measure(B ∩ (s - h, s + h)) > h + h = 2h.\n\n11. But the union of B ∩ (-h, h) and B ∩ (s - h, s + h) is contained in (-h, h) ∪ (s - h, s + h). Since |s| < h/2, this union is contained in (-h - h/2, h + h/2) = (-3h/2, 3h/2), which has measure 3h.\n\n12. However, 2h < 3h, so the measure of the union is 2h, which is less than 3h, so no contradiction. Hmm, this approach might not directly give a contradiction.\n\nMaybe another way: If B + B does not contain an interval around 0, then there exists a sequence of points approaching 0 not in B + B. But if B has density at 0, then for small s, the sets B and s - B must intersect. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, using the pigeonhole principle: Since B ∩ (-h, h) has measure greater than h, and s is small, the sets B and s - B both have measure > h in (-h, h). Since the total measure of (-h, h) is 2h, then if B and s - B were disjoint, their combined measure would be greater than h + h = 2h, which is exactly the measure of the interval. But they can't exceed the measure of the interval, so they must intersect. Therefore, B ∩ (s - B) ≠ ∅, which implies s ∈ B + B.\n\nAh, this seems like a valid argument. Let me detail this:\n\n1. Let B ⊆ ℝ be a measurable set with 0 as a density point. Then, for small enough h, measure(B ∩ (-h, h)) > h.\n\n2. Suppose s is such that |s| < h/2.\n\n3. Consider the sets B ∩ (-h, h) and (s - B) ∩ (-h, h). \n\n4. The measure of B ∩ (-h, h) > h, and measure of (s - B) ∩ (-h, h) = measure({x ∈ (-h, h) | s - x ∈ B}) = measure(B ∩ (s - (-h, h))) = measure(B ∩ (s - h, s + h)).\n\n5. Since |s| < h/2, (s - h, s + h) contains (-h/2, h/2). Given that 0 is a density point of B, measure(B ∩ (-h/2, h/2)) is close to h/2 * 2 = h, but actually we only know that measure(B ∩ (-h, h)) > h. But if we take h small enough, maybe we can ensure that measure(B ∩ (s - h, s + h)) is also > h - |s|*2 or something. Hmm, maybe this is not straightforward.\n\nWait, but let's think differently. The measure of B ∩ (-h, h) > h. Similarly, s - B ∩ (-h, h) is the set of x such that x ∈ (-h, h) and s - x ∈ B, which is equivalent to x ∈ (-h, h) and x ∈ s - B. So, x ∈ (s - B) ∩ (-h, h). The measure of this set is equal to the measure of B ∩ (s - (-h, h)) = B ∩ (s - h, s + h).\n\nNow, since s is small, say |s| < h/2, then (s - h, s + h) = (-h + s, h + s). The intersection of this with (-h, h) is (-h + s, h) if s > 0. The measure of B ∩ (s - h, s + h)) could be estimated using the density at 0. However, maybe we can use the following:\n\nSince B has density 1 at 0, for any interval around 0, the measure of B in that interval is almost the entire length. So, for small h, measure(B ∩ (-h, h)) ≈ 2h. If we take h very small, then measure(B ∩ (-h, h)) > h. Then, for s small enough, measure(B ∩ (s - h, s + h)) is also > h. Therefore, measure(B ∩ (-h, h)) + measure(B ∩ (s - h, s + h)) > h + h = 2h. But the union of these two sets is contained in (-h, h) ∪ (s - h, s + h). If |s| < h, then this union is contained in (-h, h + s). The measure of the union is less than 2h + |s|. But if |s| < h, then the union measure is less than 3h. However, if the sum of the measures exceeds the measure of the union, then by the pigeonhole principle, the sets must overlap. That is:\n\nmeasure(B ∩ (-h, h)) + measure(B ∩ (s - h, s + h)) = measure(B ∩ (-h, h)) + measure(s - B ∩ (-h, h)) > 2h.\n\nBut the union of these two sets is contained in (-h, h) ∪ (s - h, s + h). If |s| < h, the union is (-h, h + s) if s > 0, which has measure h + s + h = 2h + s < 3h.\n\nSo, if 2h > measure of the union, then there must be an overlap. Wait, but if the sum of the measures exceeds the measure of the union, then by inclusion-exclusion:\n\nmeasure(A ∪ B) = measure(A) + measure(B) - measure(A ∩ B).\n\nIf measure(A) + measure(B) > measure(A ∪ B), then measure(A ∩ B) > 0. So, in our case, if measure(B ∩ (-h, h)) + measure(s - B ∩ (-h, h)) > measure((-h, h) ∪ (s - h, s + h)), then there must be an intersection, i.e., measure(B ∩ (-h, h) ∩ (s - B ∩ (-h, h))) > 0. But this is equivalent to measure(B ∩ (s - B) ∩ (-h, h)) > 0. Hence, B ∩ (s - B) ≠ ∅, so there exists x ∈ B such that x ∈ s - B, which implies s = x + y for some y ∈ B. Therefore, s ∈ B + B.\n\nBut how do we ensure that measure(B ∩ (-h, h)) + measure(s - B ∩ (-h, h)) > measure of the union?\n\nIf the union's measure is less than the sum of the individual measures, then yes. So, we need that measure((-h, h) ∪ (s - h, s + h)) < measure(B ∩ (-h, h)) + measure(s - B ∩ (-h, h)).\n\nBut since measure(B ∩ (-h, h)) > h and measure(s - B ∩ (-h, h)) > h (if we can show that), then the sum is > 2h. The union's measure is measure((-h, h) ∪ (s - h, s + h)). If s is small, say |s| < h/2, then the union is (-h, h + s) which has measure 2h + s < 2h + h/2 = 5h/2. If 2h > 5h/2, which is not true. So this approach might not work.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up. Let me take specific values. Let h = 1 for simplicity. Let s = 0.5. Then, (-1,1) and (s -1, s +1) = (-0.5, 1.5). The union is (-1, 1.5), which has measure 2.5. The sum of the measures of B ∩ (-1,1) and B ∩ (-0.5,1.5) is each >1. So total sum >2, but union's measure is 2.5. So 2 < 2.5, so the intersection measure would be sum - union = 2 - 2.5 = -0.5, which doesn't make sense. Wait, no, the formula is measure(A ∪ B) = measure(A) + measure(B) - measure(A ∩ B). Therefore, if measure(A) + measure(B) > measure(A ∪ B), then measure(A ∩ B) = measure(A) + measure(B) - measure(A ∪ B) > 0.\n\nIn our example, if measure(A) >1 and measure(B) >1, then measure(A) + measure(B) >2. If measure(A ∪ B) <2.5, then measure(A ∩ B) >2 - 2.5 = -0.5, which is always true. But we need a positive measure. So this approach might not guarantee a positive intersection.\n\nHmm, perhaps this line of reasoning is not sufficient. Going back to the convolution approach seems more straightforward. Since the convolution is continuous and not identically zero, it must be positive on an interval, hence A + A contains that interval. Therefore, the answer involves applying the convolution argument, noting its continuity, and concluding the existence of an interval.\n\nAlternatively, using the Baire category theorem if we consider topological arguments, but I think measure-theoretic approach is the way to go here.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the key steps are:\n\n1. A has positive measure.\n\n2. The convolution of its characteristic function with itself is continuous.\n\n3. The integral of this convolution is positive, so there's a point where it's positive.\n\n4. By continuity, it's positive in an interval, meaning A + A contains that interval.\n\nTherefore, the problem can be solved by this method, and the user needs to structure the problem accordingly.",
