    "Content": "Let $G$ be a cyclic group of order $m$ generated by an element $a$.  I want to show that the order of $a^k$ is $m/d$, where $d:=\\gcd(k,m)$.  I have a simple proof, but want to make sure I haven't overlooked anything since the other proofs I've seen (such as in Dummit and Foote) look more complicated. The order of $a^k$ is the cardinality of the set $\\{a^{ks}: s \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$, which equals the cardinality of the set $\\{a^{ks} a^{mt}: s,t \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\}$ since $a^m$ is the identity.  But the set $\\{ks+mt: s,t \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\}$ is the set $d \\mathbb{Z}$ by the basic properties of integers. So we have that the cardinality of the set is $| \\langle a^k \\rangle| = |\\{1, a^d, a^{2d}, \\ldots, a^{m-d} \\}| = m/d$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "As suggested in the comments above, I shall post my proof as an answer: The order of $a^k$ is the cardinality of the set $\\{a^{ks}: s \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$, which equals the cardinality of the set $\\{a^{ks} a^{mt}: s,t \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\}$ since $a^m$ is the identity.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this problem. The user wants to show that the order of an element a^k in a finite cyclic group G is m/d, where d is the gcd of k and m. The original problem mentions that G is cyclic of order m, generated by a. The user presents their own proof and wants to check if it's correct. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that G is cyclic, which means it's generated by a single element a. The order of G is m, so the group has m elements. The element in question is a^k, and we need to find its order. The assumptions should include these points. \n\nLooking at the example provided, each assumption is a single property applied to one object. So, let me list them:\n\n1. G is a cyclic group.\n2. G has order m.\n3. G is generated by an element a.\n4. The order of a^k is to be determined.\n5. d is defined as gcd(k, m).\n\nWait, the problem mentions d = gcd(k, m), so that's another assumption. The problem is to show that the order of a^k is m/d. The user's proof uses properties of cyclic groups and gcd. \n\nNow, the original problem might not explicitly state all assumptions, but based on standard group theory, the necessary assumptions would be that G is cyclic of order m, generated by a, and d is the gcd of k and m. The problem is to prove the order of a^k is m/d. \n\nThe user's proof seems to use the fact that the subgroup generated by a^k has elements a^{ks} for integers s, and they relate this to the set {ks + mt} which is equal to dZ, hence the order is m/d. The user is concerned if their simplified proof is valid compared to more complicated ones in textbooks. \n\nBut the task here is just to structure the problem, not evaluate the proof. So, the assumptions would include the properties of G, a, m, and the definition of d. The problem is to prove the order of a^k is m/d. \n\nI need to ensure that each assumption is a single line. Let me check again:\n\nAssumption:\n- G is a cyclic group.\n- G has order m.\n- G is generated by an element a.\n- d is the greatest common divisor of k and m.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the order of a^k is m/d.\n\nWait, the original problem statement says \"Let G be a cyclic group of order m generated by an element a. I want to show that the order of a^k is m/d, where d:=gcd(k,m).\" So the problem is given G cyclic of order m generated by a, show order(a^k) = m/d where d = gcd(k,m). \n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. G is a cyclic group.\n2. The order of G is m.\n3. G is generated by an element a.\n4. d is defined as gcd(k, m).\n\nProblem: Show that the order of a^k is m/d.\n\nEach assumption is a single line addressing one property. That should fit the format.",
