    "Content": "I came across the follwing integral: $$\\int_0^{\\pi/2}x^2\\sqrt{\\cot x} \\ dx=\\frac{\\sqrt2}{8}\\left( \\frac{5\\pi^{3}}{12}-\\pi^2\\ln2-\\pi \\ln^22 \\right)$$ I try to do it like the following: Consider $$I(a,b)=\\int_0^{\\pi} \\frac{\\cos ax}{\\sin^b x}\\ dx=2\\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\frac{\\cos 2ax}{\\sin^b 2x}\\ dx$$ Then $$I''(a,b)=-8\\int_0^{\\pi/2}x^2 \\frac{\\cos 2ax}{\\sin^b 2x}\\ dx$$ Let $a=1/2,b=1/2$ $$I''(1/2,1/2)=-8\\int_0^{\\pi/2}x^2 \\frac{\\cos x}{\\sqrt{\\sin 2x}}\\ dx=-\\frac{8}{\\sqrt2}\\int_0^{\\pi/2}x^2\\sqrt{\\cot x} \\ dx $$ Back to $I(a,b),\\quad I(a,b) $ can be expressed by beta fuction by Wolfram Mathematica. $$I(a,b)=\\int_0^{\\pi} \\frac{\\cos ax}{\\sin^b x}\\ dx=\\frac{\\pi \\cdot 2^b\\cdot\\cos (\\pi a/2)\\cdot \\Gamma(1-b) }{\\Gamma(a/2-b/2+1) \\cdot \\Gamma(-a/2-b/2+1)} $$ Then we can get $I''(a,b)$ approach from other way.\nFinally,we can get $\\int_0^{\\pi/2}x^2\\sqrt{\\cot x} \\ dx$ ,but it seems a little complex. For a similar integral: $$\\int_0^{\\pi/2}x\\cdot\\tan^p x \\ dx=\\frac{\\pi}{4\\sin (p\\pi/2)}\\left(\\Psi\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)-\\Psi\\left(\\frac{1-p}{2}\\right) \\right)$$ The above integral can be solved by method of parametric development.Let $p=-\\frac{1}{2}$ ,We can get $$\\int_0^{\\pi/2}x\\sqrt{\\cot x} \\ dx=\\frac{\\pi\\left(\\pi-2\\ln 2\\right)}{4\\sqrt2}$$ But to this one, it seems to be difficult with method of parametric development.  Could you suggest any ideas how to prove this?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "A slightly easier form for $I(a, \\frac{1}{2})$ is $$I(a, \\frac{1}{2}) = 2^{a-\\frac{3}{2}} \\beta\\left(\\frac{1+2a}{4}\\right) (1 + \\sin \\pi a + \\cos \\pi a), $$ where $\\beta(p) = \\Gamma(p)^2/\\Gamma(2p)$ is the central beta function. (This can be easily obtained by applying the Euler reflection formula and the Legendre duplication formula to OP's representation.) Now from the relation $$ \\frac{d}{dp} \\log \\beta(p) \\bigg|_{p=\\frac{1}{2}} = 2\\psi(1/2) - 2\\psi(1) = 2 \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{1}{n+1} - \\frac{1}{n+\\frac{1}{2}} \\right) = -4 \\log 2 $$ and $$ \\frac{d^2}{dp^2} \\log \\beta(p) \\bigg|_{p=\\frac{1}{2}} = 2\\psi^{(1)}(1/2) - 4\\psi^{(1)}(1) = \\frac{\\pi^2}{3}, $$ we can compute $\\frac{\\partial^2 I}{\\partial a^2}(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2})$ as follows: \\begin{align*}\n&\\frac{\\partial^2 I}{\\partial a^2} (1/2, 1/2) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{4} \\beta''(1/2) - \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}-\\log 2\\right) \\beta'(1/2) - \\left(\\frac{\\pi^2}{2} + \\pi\\log 2-\\log^2 2\\right) \\beta(1/2) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{4} \\pi \\left( 16\\log^2 2 + \\frac{\\pi^2}{3} \\right) \\\\\n&\\qquad - \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}-\\log 2\\right) (-4\\pi \\log 2)\n - \\left(\\frac{\\pi^2}{2} + \\pi\\log 2-\\log^2 2\\right) \\pi \\\\\n&= -\\left(\\frac{5\\pi^3}{12} - \\pi^2\\log2 - \\pi \\log^2 2 \\right). \n\\end{align*} I am also trying a more direct approach. Using contour integral, we can check that $$ \\int_{0}^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} x^2 \\sqrt{\\cot x} \\, \\mathrm{d}x\n= \\frac{1}{3\\sqrt{2}} \\left( \\frac{\\pi^3}{4} - \\frac{3\\pi}{2} \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{\\operatorname{artanh}^2 t}{\\sqrt{t}} \\, \\mathrm{d}t \\right). $$ So I am tackling the last integral, but have no good news at this point.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let me try to tackle this problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should list each condition applied to one object, and the problem statement should be concise.\n\nFirst, I need to read through the original problem carefully. The title is about proving a specific integral result, and the question describes the user's attempt using parametric integrals and beta functions. There's also mention of a similar integral solved by another method, but the current one seems more complex.\n\nNow, the task is to filter out unrelated information. The user's attempt with I(a,b), their steps involving taking derivatives, expressions via beta functions from Wolfram, and the comparison to another integral are part of their solving process but not part of the problem statement itself. The actual problem to be proven is the integral equality given in the title and restated in the question.\n\nAssumptions need to be listed line by line, each addressing one property. Looking at the integral, the limits are from 0 to π/2, the integrand is x²√(cot x), and the result is a specific expression involving π³, π² ln 2, and π ln²2 multiplied by sqrt(2)/8. The assumptions here would be about the function being integrated and the limits. However, the problem as stated doesn't have explicit conditions beyond the integral itself. Since the integral is definite and the integrand involves sqrt(cot x), which is defined on (0, π/2) as cot x is positive there. But maybe the user didn't mention any specific conditions beyond the integral's existence. Wait, the problem is just to prove the equality. So perhaps there are no explicit assumptions beyond the integral setup. But in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, but in the example provided, the user listed the assumption as n being an integer and another assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, looking back, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The user's formatted problem listed two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems conflicting because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe the example had a mistake? Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", which would restrict it. That seems incorrect. But maybe the example was a mistake. However, the user wants me to follow their format. Wait, perhaps the example was wrong, but the user still wants me to extract assumptions from the problem. Hmm. Wait, perhaps in the original problem, the user made an error in the example. But regardless, I need to proceed with the current problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the integral is from 0 to π/2 of x²√(cot x) dx equals the given expression. The question is to prove this equality. Are there any implicit assumptions here? The integrand sqrt(cot x) is real and defined on (0, π/2) because cot x is positive there. The variable x is integrated over that interval, so maybe the assumptions are that the integral is taken over the interval [0, π/2], and the integrand is x² times the square root of cotangent x. But the problem as stated is just to compute the integral and show it equals that expression. The user didn't mention any parameters or conditions beyond the integral itself. Therefore, perhaps there are no additional assumptions besides the integral's setup. However, the example included assumptions even when the original problem didn't state them, like in the example, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added n is divisible by 7, which is incorrect. Wait, maybe the example was a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to include all given conditions as assumptions. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Unless the user made a mistake in the example. But perhaps the user intended to have the problem's assumptions listed, even if they are not explicitly stated. Wait, maybe the user's example is incorrect, but I should follow the structure they provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the example, the original problem had a mistake, and the formatted problem corrected it. But regardless, I need to structure the current problem. The current problem is to prove the integral equals the given expression. The user tried some methods involving parametric integrals and beta functions but found it complex. The problem is to prove the integral. Are there any assumptions here? The integral is definite, so the variables are integrated over the interval. The integrand involves x² and sqrt(cot x), which is defined on (0, π/2). The limits are from 0 to π/2. So perhaps the assumptions are that x is in [0, π/2], and the integrand is as given. But since the problem is just to compute the integral, maybe there are no specific assumptions beyond the integral's definition. However, the example included assumptions even when they were part of the problem statement. So maybe in this case, the assumption is that the integral is over [0, π/2], and the integrand is x²√cot x. But how to phrase that? Wait, in the example, the assumptions were about n being integer and divisible by 7, which were part of the problem's conditions. So in this case, maybe the integral's limits and the form of the integrand are part of the problem statement, not assumptions. Wait, but the problem is to prove the equality. The assumptions would be any conditions required for the integral to hold. For example, that the function is integrable over the interval, but that's usually implicit. Since the problem is presented as is, perhaps there are no explicit assumptions beyond the integral's setup. Therefore, maybe there are no assumptions to list, but according to the example, the user expects assumptions to be listed. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem's title and question have some conditions. Let me check again.\n\nThe title is: Prove that the integral from 0 to π/2 of x²√(cot x) dx equals that expression. The question starts with \"I came across the following integral\" and then shows the equality. The user then describes their approach. The problem is to prove the integral equals that value. So the only assumption is that the integral is defined as given, with x ranging from 0 to π/2, and the integrand is x² times sqrt(cot x). But since the problem is to prove the equality, the assumptions might just be the integral's definition. However, in the example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, and the formatted assumptions were n is an integer and n divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like a mistake because the original problem didn't require n to be divisible by 7. Unless the user in the example made a mistake, but in any case, I need to proceed.\n\nIn the current problem, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The integral is taken over the interval [0, π/2].\n\n- The integrand is x² multiplied by the square root of cotangent x.\n\nBut each assumption should address only one property applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe integral is over the interval from 0 to π/2.\n\nThe integrand is x² times the square root of cot x.\n\nBut maybe splitting into two lines. However, the example had two separate assumptions about n. Here, perhaps the assumptions are about the limits of integration and the form of the integrand. Alternatively, since the problem is just to compute the integral, maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond what's stated in the integral. But according to the example, even if the original problem didn't state assumptions, they were extracted. So perhaps here, the assumption is just the integral's setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are no additional assumptions, and the problem is as stated. But the example shows that assumptions were listed even when the original problem didn't have them. Maybe in the example, the user made a mistake. So perhaps in this case, since the problem is to prove the integral equals the given value, the only assumption is the integral itself, but the format requires listing assumptions. Maybe I should list the integral's components as assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to prove the equality, maybe the assumptions are about the existence of the integral, but that's too implicit. Given the confusion, I think the safest way is to list the integral's components as separate assumptions, each on one line.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe integral is evaluated from 0 to π/2.\n\nThe integrand is x² multiplied by the square root of cot x.\n\nBut each line should address only one property. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe lower limit of integration is 0.\n\nThe upper limit of integration is π/2.\n\nThe integrand is x².\n\nThe integrand includes the square root of cot x.\n\nBut that seems too granular. Alternatively, combining the limits into one line and the integrand into another.\n\nBut following the example where the user listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", perhaps in this case, the assumptions are:\n\nThe integral is from 0 to π/2.\n\nThe integrand is x²√(cot x).\n\nBut how to split into separate lines? For example:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe variable x is integrated from 0 to π/2.\n\nThe integrand is x² multiplied by the square root of cot x.\n\nEach of these addresses one property. The first addresses the limits of integration, the second the form of the integrand.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe integral is evaluated over the interval [0, π/2].\n\nThe integrand is x² times the square root of cot x.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that\n\n$$\\int_0^{\\pi/2}x^2\\sqrt{\\cot x} \\, dx=\\frac{\\sqrt2}{8}\\left( \\frac{5\\pi^{3}}{12}-\\pi^2\\ln2-\\pi \\ln^22 \\right).$$\n\nBut let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted assumptions were n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7; it said for every integer n. That seems like an error. Perhaps the example was incorrect, but the user provided it as their structure. Therefore, perhaps in this case, even if the original problem doesn't state additional assumptions, I should list the components as assumptions. Alternatively, maybe the example's original problem had a mistake, and the correct assumptions should be n is an integer, but the user mistakenly added n divisible by 7. Given that, perhaps the current problem should have assumptions related to the integral's components. However, since the example's assumption included a condition not in the original problem, perhaps I need to be cautious. But given the instructions, I should follow the user's example structure. Therefore, for the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\nThe integral is from 0 to π/2.\n\nThe integrand is x²√(cot x).\n\nEach as separate lines.\n\nSo, the final formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe integral is evaluated from 0 to π/2.\n\nThe integrand is x² multiplied by the square root of cot x.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that\n\n$$\\int_0^{\\pi/2}x^2\\sqrt{\\cot x} \\, dx=\\frac{\\sqrt2}{8}\\left( \\frac{5\\pi^{3}}{12}-\\pi^2\\ln2-\\pi \\ln^22 \\right).$$\n\nYes, that seems to fit the format.
