    "Content": "I'm looking for slick proofs that if $a_n$ is a sequence of complex numbers such that $\\sum\\limits_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{a_k}{k}$ converges then $\\lim\\limits_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{k=1}^n a_k=0$. My not so slick proof: Let $A_x=\\sum\\limits_{k=1}^{x} a_k$ and apply an Abel sum with the function $f(x)=\\frac{1}{x}$. We get $$\\sum\\limits_{k=1}^n \\frac{a_k}{k}-\\int\\limits_1^n\\frac{A_x}{x^2}dx=\\frac{A_n}{n}.$$ Of course we can split the integral into chunks to get $$\\sum\\limits_{k=1}^n \\frac{a_k}{k}-\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n \\left( \\frac{1}{k+1}-\\frac{1}{k} \\right) A_k=\\frac{A_n}{n}.$$ If we expand $A_k$ on the left side, it telescopes and yields $$\\sum\\limits_{k=1}^n \\frac{a_k}{k} + \\sum\\limits_{k=1}^n \\left( 1-\\frac{1}{k+1}\\right) a_k=\\frac{A_n}{n}\\iff \\frac{(n-1)A_n}{n}=\\sum\\limits_{k=1}^n\\frac{a_k}{k(k+1)}.$$ The norm of the right side  of the equation is clearly $\\mathcal O(\\log(n))$ (using the triangle inequality and the fact that $\\frac{a_k}{k}$ is bounded). The desired result follows after dividing both sides by $n-1$. I would also appreciate some proof verification. Initially, I thought that the problem was going to be really easy, but it took me a bit of effort. Am I missing something major? The original problem is for real sequences, but I don't think this helps. Obviously if the sequence converged absolutely then it would also be absolutely trivial.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $b_k = \\dfrac{a_k}{k}$, and define $$R_m = \\sum_{k = m}^{\\infty} b_k.$$ Then \\begin{align}\n\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{k = 1}^n a_k &= \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k = 1}^n kb_k \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{k = 1}^n\\sum_{m = k}^n b_m \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{k = 1}^n \\bigl(R_k - R_{n+1}\\bigr) \\\\\n&= \\Biggl(\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{k = 1}^n R_k\\Biggr) - R_{n+1}.\n\\end{align} Now use that $R_k \\to 0$, and that the Cesàro means of a convergent sequence converge to the same limit.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem and structure it according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the problem by listing assumptions and the problem statement. \n\nFirst, looking at the original question on Math Stack Exchange. The title is about proving that if the series sum of a_k/k converges, then the average of a_k tends to zero. The user's question is asking for slick proofs of this statement and includes their own attempt.\n\nThe task here is to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. The example given shows that assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. \n\nSo, the main problem is: If the sum from k=1 to infinity of a_k/k converges, then prove that the limit as n approaches infinity of (1/n) times the sum from k=1 to n of a_k is zero.\n\nAssumptions here would be that a_n is a sequence of complex numbers, and the series sum of a_k/k converges. Each of these should be separate. So:\n\nAssumption 1: a_n is a sequence of complex numbers.\n\nAssumption 2: The series ∑_{k=1}^∞ (a_k)/k converges.\n\nProblem: Prove that lim_{n→∞} (1/n) ∑_{k=1}^n a_k = 0.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is one line, one property. The original problem mentions complex numbers, so that's one condition. The convergence of the series is another. The problem is to show the average tends to zero. The user's example in the problem had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, similarly, two assumptions: a_n is a sequence of complex numbers, and the series converges. \n\nI don't see any other assumptions in the problem. The user mentions it's originally for real sequences but doesn't think that helps, but the problem as stated by the user includes complex numbers. So the assumptions are as above. The problem statement is exactly as given in the title and the question. So I think that's all.",
