    "Content": "I understand the wizardry that $\\cos 20^\\circ \\cos 40^\\circ  \\cos 80^\\circ=\\dfrac18$ Proving it isn't that hard. Taking the left hand side and multiplying it up and down by $\\sin 20$ yields: \\begin{align} \n& \\dfrac{\\sin 20^\\circ}{\\sin 20^\\circ} \\cdot \\cos 20^\\circ \\cos 40^\\circ \\cos 80^\\circ \\\\ \n=&\\dfrac{\\sin 40^\\circ}{2\\sin 20^\\circ} \\cdot  \\cos 40^\\circ \\cos 80^\\circ \\\\ =& \\dfrac{\\sin 80^\\circ}{4\\sin 20^\\circ} \\cdot \\cos 80^\\circ \\\\ =& \\dfrac{\\sin 160^\\circ}{8\\sin 20^\\circ}=\\dfrac{\\sin 20^\\circ}{8\\sin 20^\\circ}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{8}}\n \\end{align} My question is, is there a geometric proof of this, or the corollary $\\sin 10 \\sin 50 \\sin 70^\\circ$ ? Inspired by the possibility from this other indentity I'm hoping that it's possible. I tried doing a similar construction as in the link that didn't go so well, mainly because of my repeated use of the cosine rule. Is my quest achievable? Thanks for any guidance and advice.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants a geometric proof of the identity cos20° * cos40° * cos80° = 1/8. They already know an algebraic proof using sine multiplication, but they're asking specifically for a geometric approach, maybe using triangles or some construction. The example they linked might be similar to another trigonometric identity proven geometrically.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The main assumption is that the angles 20°, 40°, and 80° are involved in a product of cosines. The problem is to show that their product equals 1/8 using geometry rather than algebraic manipulation. The user also mentions a related identity sin10° * sin50° * sin70°, so maybe that's a corollary, but the main focus is on the cosines.\n\nSo, the assumptions should include each angle being part of the cosine terms. Let me check the example given. In the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the key elements are the angles and the product of cosines. But since the problem is about equality, the assumptions would be the specific angles provided. Wait, but the problem doesn't state any conditions on the angles except their measures. So each angle is 20°, 40°, and 80°, which are fixed. So each cosine term is of those angles.\n\nThe problem is to prove the product equals 1/8 geometrically. So the assumptions would list the three angles and their cosines multiplied together. Since the example listed each assumption line by line for each property, maybe each angle is a separate assumption.\n\nWait, but in the original example, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is not about variables but specific angles. So perhaps the assumptions are the definitions of the angles in the product. However, maybe the problem's assumptions are inherent in the trigonometric identity. Let me think. The problem is to prove that the product of these three cosines equals 1/8. The only assumptions needed are that the angles are 20°, 40°, and 80°, and that we are working in a Euclidean plane where geometric constructions apply. But the example given didn't mention the geometry part as an assumption; the example's assumptions were about n. So maybe here the assumptions are just the three angles. Let me structure them each as separate lines.\n\nAssumption:\nThe angles considered are 20 degrees,\nThe angles considered are 40 degrees,\nThe angles considered are 80 degrees,\nProblem: Prove that cos20° * cos40° * cos80° equals 1/8 geometrically.\n\nWait, but in the original example, the assumptions were about the properties of n, not the terms in the expression. The user's example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But here, the problem is not about variables but fixed angles. So perhaps the assumptions are the angles given. But maybe the problem doesn't have assumptions in the same way, but since the format requires assumptions, I need to list what's given. The problem states the product of three cosines with those angles. So maybe the assumptions are the three angles involved. But each angle is part of the problem statement. Alternatively, maybe there are no additional assumptions beyond the problem statement. But the example included even the divisibility by 7 as an assumption. So perhaps in this case, the problem is to prove the identity, and the assumptions are the angles specified. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe there's an implicit assumption that these angles are in a triangle or something, but the problem doesn't specify that. The user is asking for a geometric proof, so perhaps the assumption is that the angles can be represented in a geometric figure. But how to phrase that? Maybe the problem is self-contained, so the assumptions are the three angles and their cosines being multiplied. But the original example split the assumptions into lines. So I need to list each angle as a separate assumption. For example:\n\nAssumption:\nThe first angle is 20 degrees,\nThe second angle is 40 degrees,\nThe third angle is 80 degrees,\nProblem: Prove that the product cos20° * cos40° * cos80° equals 1/8 using a geometric method.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem's assumptions are that these angles are parts of a geometric configuration where their cosines can be related. But without more info, perhaps the safest is to list each angle as an assumption. Let me check the user's example again. In their example, the problem was about proving a divisibility condition, and the assumptions were about n being integer and divisible by 7. So here, the problem is similar but the angles are given. So the assumptions would be each angle's measure. Therefore, each angle is listed as a separate assumption.",
