    "Content": "The $a_n$'s are integers, positive, and increasing: $0< a_1 < a_2 < \\cdots$, the problem asks us to prove that:\n$$\n\\sum^{\\infty}_{n=1} \\frac{a_{n+1}-a_{n}}{a_{n}}=\\infty\n$$ \nWhile I have checked this results for several series like $a_n = n$, $a_n = n^2$, $a_n = n^p$, or $a_n = p^n$ type stuff, I don't know how to prove this general result.

    "AcceptedAnswer": "I never thought I'd answer a question asked by a superhero! I would advise Mr. Iron Man to use the following well-known theorem: Let $\\{x_i\\}$ be a sequence of positive real numbers. Then the product $$\\prod_{i=1}^\\infty (1+x_i)$$ converges if and only if the series $$\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty x_i$$ converges. In the present case case, notice that $$1+\\frac{a_{i+1}-a_i}{a_i} = \\frac{a_{i+1}}{a_i}$$ so the partial products of the infinite product telescope, to give $a_{n+1}/a_1$, which tends to $+\\infty$ by assumption. Therefore, the series $\\sum \\frac{a_{i+1}-a_i}{a_i}$ diverges. Remark Your series is analogous to the integral $$\\int_0^\\infty df/f$$ where $f$ is a positive function. Of course, this integral equals $\\varinjlim_{x \\to \\infty} \\log (f(x)/f(0))$, which is $+ \\infty$ if $f \\to \\infty$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem correctly following the given format. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the problem by listing assumptions line by line and then state the problem.\n\nFirst, I need to read the original problem carefully. The problem is about proving that a certain infinite series diverges for an increasing sequence of positive integers a_n. The series in question is the sum from n=1 to infinity of (a_{n+1} - a_n)/a_n.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object. In the example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. Each assumption is a separate line.\n\nSo, for the current problem, I need to extract all the assumptions. The problem states that a_n is an increasing sequence of positive integers. Let me parse the original question again:\n\n\"The a_n's are integers, positive, and increasing: 0 < a_1 < a_2 < ...\"\n\nBreaking this down, the assumptions are:\n\n1. Each a_n is a positive integer.\n2. The sequence a_n is strictly increasing (a_1 < a_2 < ...).\n3. The sequence starts with a_1 greater than 0.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should be a single line addressing one property applied to one object. Here, the sequence a_n has multiple properties: being integers, positive, increasing. So each of these should be separate assumptions.\n\nWait, but \"positive\" and \"integers\" are both properties of the terms a_n. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption 1: a_n is a sequence of positive integers.\n\nBut the example splits \"integer\" and \"divisible by 7\" into separate lines. So maybe I should split them here as well. However, in the original problem statement, the user wrote \"The a_n's are integers, positive, and increasing\". So three properties:\n\n1. Each a_n is an integer.\n2. Each a_n is positive.\n3. The sequence a_n is strictly increasing.\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"0 < a_1 < a_2 < ...\", so maybe also a_1 is positive? But that's covered by each a_n being positive. However, the sequence being increasing is separate. Let me check:\n\nIn the original problem statement, the user says \"the a_n's are integers, positive, and increasing: 0< a_1 < a_2 < ...\", so the three main conditions are:\n\n- Integers: each term is an integer.\n\n- Positive: each term is positive.\n\n- Increasing: the sequence is strictly increasing (a_1 < a_2 < ...).\n\nTherefore, these are three separate conditions. However, the example splits \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" even though both are properties of n. So in this case, the three conditions should each be separate lines in the assumptions.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n1. Each term a_n is a positive integer.\n\nWait, but in the example, \"n is an integer\" is one assumption. Here, each a_n is a positive integer. But \"positive\" and \"integer\" are two separate properties. However, in the problem statement, they are stated together. But according to the example, they should be split. Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is \"n is an integer\". Then the user added \"n is divisible by 7\" as another assumption. So perhaps if a_n is both an integer and positive, each should be a separate assumption.\n\nWait, but \"positive integer\" is a single property? Or is \"positive\" and \"integer\" two separate properties? For example, \"integer\" is a type, and \"positive\" is a condition on that integer. So maybe they can be split. However, in the problem statement, the user writes \"The a_n's are integers, positive, and increasing\". So they are three separate properties: integer, positive, and increasing.\n\nTherefore, each of these three should be separate assumptions:\n\nAssumption 1: Each term a_n is an integer.\n\nAssumption 2: Each term a_n is positive.\n\nAssumption 3: The sequence a_n is strictly increasing (i.e., a_{n+1} > a_n for all n).\n\nBut wait, the problem states \"0 < a_1 < a_2 < ...\", which implies that the sequence is strictly increasing. So the third assumption is that the sequence is strictly increasing.\n\nBut in the problem statement, they mention \"increasing: 0 < a_1 < a_2 < ...\", which combines two things: positivity of a_1 and strict increasingness. However, the positivity of each term is already covered by assumption 2. So perhaps \"the sequence a_n is strictly increasing\" is enough for assumption 3.\n\nThus, the three assumptions are:\n\n- a_n is a sequence of integers.\n\n- Each term a_n is positive.\n\n- The sequence a_n is strictly increasing.\n\nEach of these is a separate line in the assumptions.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that the sum from n=1 to infinity of (a_{n+1} - a_n)/a_n diverges.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nEach term a_n is an integer,\nEach term a_n is positive,\nThe sequence a_n is strictly increasing.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum^{\\infty}_{n=1} \\frac{a_{n+1}-a_{n}}{a_{n}}=\\infty.$$\n\nI need to check if I missed any assumptions. The original problem says \"for an increasing sequence a_n of positive integers\". So the key points are: integers, positive, increasing. The problem does not specify any other conditions, like a_n being bounded or something else. So the three assumptions above should cover all the given conditions.\n\nThe example given by the user had two assumptions for the problem, even though the original problem only said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. However, the formatted problem lists assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but that's contradictory. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was:\n\n\"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\"\n\nBut the formatted problem is:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems like the user made a mistake, but perhaps in the example, the original problem actually had a typo or the answerer added the divisibility by 7. Wait, no, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which seems incorrect. Wait, maybe there was a mistake in the example. But perhaps the original problem required divisibility by 91, which factors into 7*13, so maybe the user intended that n needs to satisfy some condition? Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nBut in our current problem, the original problem does not have any hidden assumptions; it's straightforward. The problem states that a_n is an increasing sequence of positive integers, and the sum (a_{n+1}-a_n)/a_n diverges. So the assumptions are as I listed.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have three assumptions: integers, positive, strictly increasing. Then the problem is to prove the divergence of the sum.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem statement:\n\n\"Prove that for an increasing sequence a_n of positive integers, the sum from n=1 to infinity of (a_{n+1}-a_n)/a_n equals infinity.\"\n\nThe assumptions here are:\n\n1. a_n is a sequence of positive integers.\n\nBut actually, \"positive integers\" can be split into two: positive and integers. But in the example, \"n is an integer\" was a separate assumption. So perhaps:\n\n1. Each term a_n is an integer.\n\n2. Each term a_n is positive.\n\n3. The sequence a_n is strictly increasing.\n\nYes, that seems to fit the example's structure. Each line is one property of one object. The object here is the sequence a_n, but each term is an integer, each term is positive, and the sequence is increasing. Therefore, three separate assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nEach term a_n is an integer,\nEach term a_n is positive,\nThe sequence a_n is strictly increasing.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum^{\\infty}_{n=1} \\frac{a_{n+1}-a_{n}}{a_{n}}=\\infty.$$\n\nYes, that looks correct. No other hidden assumptions. The user in the question also checked specific examples like a_n = n, n^2, etc., but those are examples, not part of the problem's assumptions.",
