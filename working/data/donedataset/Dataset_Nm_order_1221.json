    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this integral problem. The goal is to prove that the integral from 0 to c of (x sin(x/2)) divided by the square root of (cos x - cos c) dx equals sqrt(2) pi ln(sec(c/2)). The user mentioned they know the answer but couldn't get the pi factor to appear. Let me start by understanding the components of the integral and see if I can find a substitution or method that might simplify it.\n\nFirst, the integral is from 0 to c, and the integrand is x sin(x/2) over sqrt(cos x - cos c). The variable c is between 0 and pi. The presence of sqrt(cos x - cos c) in the denominator suggests that maybe a substitution involving trigonometric identities could help simplify this expression. Also, the presence of x in the numerator might hint at integration by parts, but since it's multiplied by another function (sin(x/2)), that might complicate things.\n\nLet me recall some trigonometric identities. The denominator has cos x - cos c. There's an identity for the difference of cosines: cos a - cos b = -2 sin((a+b)/2) sin((a - b)/2). Applying this to cos x - cos c, we get:\n\ncos x - cos c = -2 sin((x + c)/2) sin((x - c)/2). But since we're taking the square root, the negative sign might be an issue. However, since x ranges from 0 to c (and c is between 0 and pi), when x is between 0 and c, (x - c) is between -c and 0, so sin((x - c)/2) would be negative. But the product of the two sines would be negative, and since there's a -2, the entire expression becomes positive. Wait, let's check that:\n\nIf x is in [0, c], then (x + c)/2 ranges from c/2 to c, so sin((x + c)/2) is positive (since c < pi, so (x + c)/2 < (c + c)/2 = c < pi). Similarly, (x - c)/2 ranges from -c/2 to 0, so sin((x - c)/2) is negative. Therefore, cos x - cos c = -2 [positive][negative] = -2 * positive * negative = positive. Therefore, sqrt(cos x - cos c) is real and positive, which is good.\n\nSo, sqrt(cos x - cos c) = sqrt(2 sin((x + c)/2) sin((c - x)/2)). Wait, because (x - c)/2 = -(c - x)/2, so sin((x - c)/2) = -sin((c - x)/2). Therefore, cos x - cos c = 2 sin((x + c)/2) sin((c - x)/2). So sqrt(cos x - cos c) = sqrt(2) sqrt(sin((x + c)/2) sin((c - x)/2)).\n\nHmm, maybe this isn't directly helpful. Alternatively, perhaps we can use a substitution to simplify the integral. Let me consider substituting t = cos x. Then dt/dx = -sin x, so dx = -dt/sin x. But when x = 0, t = cos 0 = 1; when x = c, t = cos c. However, the denominator would become sqrt(t - cos c), and the numerator is x sin(x/2). This might not be straightforward because x is still present, and expressing x in terms of t could complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use a substitution that relates to the angle difference. Let me think about changing variables to u = c - x. Let u = c - x, then when x = 0, u = c; when x = c, u = 0. Then du = -dx, so the integral becomes integral from u = c to 0 of ( (c - u) sin( (c - u)/2 ) / sqrt( cos(c - u) - cos c ) ) (-du). Which flips the limits back to 0 to c, and the integral becomes integral from 0 to c of ( (c - u) sin( (c - u)/2 ) / sqrt( cos(c - u) - cos c ) ) du. Not sure if this helps, but maybe symmetry could be exploited here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use substitution related to the half-angle formula. Let me recall that sqrt( (cos x - cos c)/2 ) = sin( (c - x)/2 ) sin( (c + x)/2 ). Wait, from the difference formula:\n\ncos x - cos c = -2 sin( (x + c)/2 ) sin( (x - c)/2 ) = 2 sin( (x + c)/2 ) sin( (c - x)/2 )\n\nSo sqrt( cos x - cos c ) = sqrt( 2 sin( (x + c)/2 ) sin( (c - x)/2 ) )\n\nBut maybe this expression can be simplified using some trigonometric identities. Alternatively, perhaps a substitution like t = sin( (c - x)/2 ), but I need to think more carefully.\n\nAnother approach might be to consider the integral as involving x times some function, which might suggest integration by parts. Let's consider setting u = x, dv = sin(x/2) / sqrt(cos x - cos c) dx. Then du = dx, and v would be the integral of sin(x/2)/sqrt(cos x - cos c) dx. However, integrating dv might not be straightforward. Let me check:\n\nCompute v = ∫ sin(x/2) / sqrt(cos x - cos c) dx.\n\nPerhaps substitution here. Let me set y = cos x. Then dy = -sin x dx. Hmm, but we have sin(x/2) in the numerator. Maybe another substitution. Let me try substituting t = sqrt(cos x - cos c). Then dt/dx = (-sin x) / (2 sqrt(cos x - cos c)). Hmm, but this seems to bring in sin x, which isn't directly present in the integrand. Alternatively, perhaps a substitution that would make the denominator simpler.\n\nWait, let me try to look at the integral v = ∫ sin(x/2) / sqrt(cos x - cos c) dx.\n\nLet me express sin(x/2) in terms of other trigonometric functions. Recall that sin(x/2) = sqrt( (1 - cos x)/2 ). But not sure if that helps here. Alternatively, maybe use substitution u = cos x - cos c. Then du = -sin x dx. Hmm, but again, we have sin(x/2) in the numerator. Maybe express sin(x/2) in terms of sin x. We know that sin x = 2 sin(x/2) cos(x/2). So sin(x/2) = sin x / (2 cos(x/2)). But substituting this into the integral gives:\n\nv = ∫ [ sin x / (2 cos(x/2)) ] / sqrt(cos x - cos c) dx = (1/2) ∫ sin x / [ cos(x/2) sqrt(cos x - cos c) ] dx.\n\nNot sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe a substitution to handle the sqrt(cos x - cos c). Let me set t = sqrt(cos x - cos c). Then t^2 = cos x - cos c. Differentiating both sides: 2t dt = -sin x dx. So sin x dx = -2t dt. But again, how does this relate to the integrand? The integrand has sin(x/2) dx. Hmm, perhaps not directly helpful.\n\nWait, another thought. Since the answer involves ln(sec(c/2)) which is ln(1 / cos(c/2)) = -ln(cos(c/2)), but the given answer is sqrt(2) pi times that. So maybe there's a substitution that introduces a logarithmic term, and the pi comes from integrating over an interval that relates to a semicircle or something involving pi.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a substitution using theta = x/2 or something. Let me try changing variables to theta = x/2. Then x = 2 theta, dx = 2 d theta. The integral becomes:\n\n∫ from theta = 0 to theta = c/2 of (2 theta) sin(theta) / sqrt(cos(2 theta) - cos c) * 2 d theta = 4 ∫ theta sin theta / sqrt(cos(2 theta) - cos c) d theta.\n\nHmm, not sure if this helps. But cos(2 theta) can be written as 2 cos^2 theta - 1. So cos(2 theta) - cos c = 2 cos^2 theta - 1 - cos c. Maybe not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps another identity. Let me consider the denominator again: cos x - cos c. If I use the identity cos x = 1 - 2 sin^2(x/2), then cos x - cos c = 2 [ sin^2(c/2) - sin^2(x/2) ] = 2 [ (sin(c/2) - sin(x/2))(sin(c/2) + sin(x/2)) ].\n\nAlternatively, using the identity cos x - cos c = 2 sin( (c + x)/2 ) sin( (c - x)/2 ), as I had earlier.\n\nSo sqrt(cos x - cos c) = sqrt(2 sin( (c + x)/2 ) sin( (c - x)/2 )).\n\nSo the integrand becomes x sin(x/2) / sqrt(2 sin( (c + x)/2 ) sin( (c - x)/2 )).\n\nHmm. Maybe simplifying this expression. Let's write the denominator as sqrt(2) times sqrt( sin( (c + x)/2 ) sin( (c - x)/2 ) ). Then the integrand becomes x sin(x/2) / [ sqrt(2) sqrt( sin( (c + x)/2 ) sin( (c - x)/2 ) ) ].\n\nThis might not immediately help. Alternatively, perhaps consider a substitution that would symmetrize the expression. Let me set t = (c - x)/2. Then when x = 0, t = c/2; when x = c, t = 0. Then dt/dx = -1/2, so dx = -2 dt. The integral becomes:\n\n∫ from t = c/2 to t = 0 of ( c - 2t ) sin( (c - 2t)/2 ) / sqrt( cos(c - 2t) - cos c ) * (-2 dt) )\n\n= 2 ∫ from t=0 to t=c/2 of (c - 2t) sin( (c/2 - t) ) / sqrt( cos(c - 2t) - cos c ) dt.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this helps. Let me compute cos(c - 2t) - cos c. Using the identity for cosine difference:\n\ncos(c - 2t) - cos c = cos c cos 2t + sin c sin 2t - cos c = cos c (cos 2t - 1) + sin c sin 2t = -2 cos c sin^2 t + 2 sin c sin t cos t.\n\nHmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps expanding cos(c - 2t) as cos(2t - c) but that might not help. Alternatively, use the difference formula again:\n\ncos(c - 2t) - cos c = -2 sin( (c - 2t + c)/2 ) sin( (c - 2t - c)/2 ) = -2 sin( (2c - 2t)/2 ) sin( (-2t)/2 ) = -2 sin(c - t) sin(-t) = 2 sin(c - t) sin t.\n\nSo sqrt(cos(c - 2t) - cos c) = sqrt(2 sin(c - t) sin t).\n\nTherefore, the integrand becomes:\n\n2 * (c - 2t) sin( c/2 - t ) / sqrt(2 sin(c - t) sin t ) dt.\n\nHmm, perhaps simplifying this:\n\n= 2 / sqrt(2) * (c - 2t) sin(c/2 - t) / sqrt( sin(c - t) sin t ) dt\n\n= sqrt(2) * (c - 2t) sin(c/2 - t) / sqrt( sin(c - t) sin t ) dt.\n\nBut sin(c/2 - t) can be written using angle subtraction formula: sin(c/2) cos t - cos(c/2) sin t. Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps if we let u = t, then maybe some terms can cancel. But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider another substitution. Let me think about the answer: sqrt(2) pi ln(sec(c/2)). The presence of pi suggests that maybe an integral involving a known result that gives pi, such as an integral over a semicircle or involving trigonometric functions that integrate to pi.\n\nAlternatively, maybe parametrize the integral in terms of a substitution that relates to the beta function or gamma function, but that might be overcomplicating.\n\nWait, another idea: maybe use substitution based on theta, such that theta is related to the angle in the denominator. Let me think: Let’s consider a substitution where we set u = cos x. Then du = -sin x dx, but we have sin(x/2) in the numerator. Let's see:\n\nLet’s express sin(x/2) in terms of sqrt((1 - cos x)/2), which is sin(x/2) = sqrt( (1 - cos x)/2 ). So sin(x/2) = sqrt( (1 - u)/2 ). Then the integrand becomes x * sqrt( (1 - u)/2 ) / sqrt(u - cos c) * (-du/sin x). But sin x = sqrt(1 - u^2), so dx = - du / sqrt(1 - u^2). Putting it all together:\n\nIntegral becomes:\n\n∫ from u=1 to u=cos c of x * sqrt( (1 - u)/2 ) / sqrt(u - cos c) * (- du / sqrt(1 - u^2)) )\n\nBut this seems messy, especially since x is still present, and we would need to express x in terms of u, which is x = arccos u. That might not lead anywhere.\n\nAlternatively, maybe try differentiation under the integral sign. Let’s denote the integral as I(c). Maybe compute dI/dc and see if it simplifies.\n\nBut before that, let's check if the integral can be related to known integrals. The presence of sqrt(cos x - cos c) in the denominator suggests that maybe an elliptic integral, but the answer involves a logarithm, so perhaps it's reducible to a standard integral.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider a substitution that rationalizes the denominator. For example, set t = sqrt( (cos x - cos c) ). Then t^2 = cos x - cos c. Differentiating, 2t dt = -sin x dx. Hmm, but we have sin(x/2) dx in the numerator. Let me express sin(x) in terms of sin(x/2). Since sin x = 2 sin(x/2) cos(x/2), then we have:\n\n2t dt = -2 sin(x/2) cos(x/2) dx → t dt = - sin(x/2) cos(x/2) dx → dx = - t dt / ( sin(x/2) cos(x/2) )\n\nBut in the integrand, we have x sin(x/2) dx / t. Substituting dx from above:\n\nx sin(x/2) * [ - t dt / ( sin(x/2) cos(x/2) ) ] / t = x * (- dt / cos(x/2) )\n\nHmm, this simplifies to -x / cos(x/2) dt. But we still have x in terms of t, which is x = arccos(t^2 + cos c). This seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a substitution that can linearize the square root. Let me think: Suppose we set t = sin( (x)/2 ). Then dt = (1/2) cos(x/2) dx → dx = 2 dt / cos(x/2). Then, cos x = 1 - 2t^2. So cos x - cos c = (1 - 2t^2) - cos c = (1 - cos c) - 2t^2. The denominator becomes sqrt( (1 - cos c) - 2t^2 ). The numerator x sin(x/2) becomes x t. But x would still need to be expressed in terms of t, which is x = 2 arcsin t, making this substitution potentially complicated. However, maybe this can help. Let me try:\n\nIntegral becomes ∫ from t=0 to t=sin(c/2) of (2 arcsin t) * t / sqrt( (1 - cos c) - 2t^2 ) * (2 dt / sqrt(1 - t^2)) )\n\nThis seems more complex. Maybe not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: Let me consider the integral ∫ x sin(x/2) / sqrt(cos x - cos c) dx from 0 to c. Since the answer involves pi, which often comes from integrating over a full period or half-period in trigonometric integrals. Alternatively, maybe extending the integral to a known form.\n\nWait, perhaps consider substituting y = c - x. Let me try that again. When x goes from 0 to c, y goes from c to 0. Then the integral becomes:\n\n∫_{y=c}^{0} (c - y) sin( (c - y)/2 ) / sqrt( cos(c - y) - cos c ) (-dy)\n\n= ∫_{0}^{c} (c - y) sin( (c - y)/2 ) / sqrt( cos(c - y) - cos c ) dy\n\nBut cos(c - y) = cos c cos y + sin c sin y. So cos(c - y) - cos c = cos c (cos y - 1) + sin c sin y\n\nHmm, but not sure if this helps. Alternatively, perhaps if we add the original integral and the substituted one. Let me denote the original integral as I. Then after substitution, we have:\n\nI = ∫_{0}^{c} x sin(x/2) / sqrt(cos x - cos c) dx\n\nAfter substitution, we also have:\n\nI = ∫_{0}^{c} (c - y) sin( (c - y)/2 ) / sqrt( cos(c - y) - cos c ) dy\n\nAdding these two expressions for I:\n\n2I = ∫_{0}^{c} [x sin(x/2) + (c - x) sin( (c - x)/2 ) ] / sqrt(cos x - cos c) dx\n\nBut I'm not sure if this sum simplifies. Let me check the numerator:\n\nx sin(x/2) + (c - x) sin( (c - x)/2 )\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe if we could find a symmetry here. Alternatively, perhaps if we set x = c - t, then we might get an expression similar to the original.\n\nAlternatively, another idea: Let's look at the integral and try to split it into parts. The integrand has x times a function, which suggests integration by parts. Let's try that.\n\nLet u = x, dv = sin(x/2) / sqrt(cos x - cos c) dx\n\nThen du = dx, and v = ∫ sin(x/2) / sqrt(cos x - cos c) dx\n\nIf we can compute v, then integration by parts would give:\n\nI = uv | from 0 to c - ∫ v du\n\nBut computing v seems difficult. Let me attempt to find v.\n\nCompute v = ∫ sin(x/2) / sqrt(cos x - cos c) dx\n\nLet me try substitution t = cos x - cos c. Then dt = -sin x dx. Hmm, but we have sin(x/2) dx. Let's express sin x in terms of sin(x/2). As before, sin x = 2 sin(x/2) cos(x/2). So dt = -2 sin(x/2) cos(x/2) dx → sin(x/2) dx = - dt / (2 cos(x/2))\n\nBut in v, we have sin(x/2) dx / sqrt(t). So substituting:\n\nv = ∫ sin(x/2) dx / sqrt(t) = ∫ ( - dt / (2 cos(x/2)) ) / sqrt(t)\n\nBut t = cos x - cos c. Hmm, this seems to complicate things because cos(x/2) is still present, and we need to express it in terms of t. Let's see:\n\ncos x = t + cos c. Using the double-angle formula, cos x = 2 cos^2(x/2) - 1, so:\n\nt + cos c = 2 cos^2(x/2) - 1 → cos^2(x/2) = (t + cos c + 1)/2 → cos(x/2) = sqrt( (t + cos c + 1)/2 )\n\nTherefore, the integral becomes:\n\nv = - ∫ [ 1 / (2 sqrt( (t + cos c + 1)/2 )) ] * dt / sqrt(t)\n\n= - ∫ [ 1 / (2 sqrt( (t + cos c + 1)/2 )) ] * t^{-1/2} dt\n\n= - (1/2) * sqrt(2) ∫ [ 1 / sqrt(t + cos c + 1) ) ] * t^{-1/2} dt\n\n= - (sqrt(2)/2) ∫ t^{-1/2} / sqrt(t + cos c + 1) dt\n\nLet me set s = sqrt(t), so t = s^2, dt = 2s ds. Then the integral becomes:\n\n- (sqrt(2)/2) ∫ (s^{-1}) / sqrt(s^2 + cos c + 1) * 2s ds\n\n= - sqrt(2) ∫ 1 / sqrt(s^2 + (cos c + 1)) ds\n\nThe integral of 1 / sqrt(s^2 + a^2) ds is sinh^{-1}(s / a) + C, or ln(s + sqrt(s^2 + a^2)) + C.\n\nTherefore,\n\nv = - sqrt(2) ln(s + sqrt(s^2 + cos c + 1)) + C\n\nSubstituting back s = sqrt(t) = sqrt(cos x - cos c):\n\nv = - sqrt(2) ln( sqrt(cos x - cos c) + sqrt(cos x - cos c + cos c + 1) ) + C\n\nSimplify the argument inside the log:\n\nsqrt(cos x - cos c) + sqrt(cos x + 1)\n\nBut cos x + 1 = 2 cos^2(x/2). So sqrt(cos x + 1) = sqrt(2) cos(x/2). Therefore:\n\nv = - sqrt(2) ln( sqrt(cos x - cos c) + sqrt(2) cos(x/2) ) + C\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe we can evaluate it between the limits 0 to c.\n\nWait, but the original integration by parts requires v to be expressed in terms of x. Let's compute v(x) as:\n\nv(x) = - sqrt(2) ln( sqrt(cos x - cos c) + sqrt(2) cos(x/2) ) + C\n\nWe can determine the constant C by evaluating the indefinite integral at a specific point, but since we are going to use v in integration by parts from 0 to c, the constant will cancel out.\n\nNow, applying integration by parts to I:\n\nI = [x v(x)] from 0 to c - ∫_{0}^{c} v(x) dx\n\nAt x = c, the term x v(x) is c * v(c). At x = 0, it's 0 * v(0) = 0.\n\nSo I = c v(c) - ∫_{0}^{c} v(x) dx\n\nLet's compute v(c):\n\nAt x = c, cos x - cos c = 0, so sqrt(0) = 0. Also, sqrt(2) cos(c/2). So v(c) = - sqrt(2) ln(0 + sqrt(2) cos(c/2)) = - sqrt(2) ln( sqrt(2) cos(c/2) )\n\nSimilarly, at x = 0, cos x - cos c = 1 - cos c, and sqrt(1 - cos c) = sqrt(2) sin(c/2), using the identity 1 - cos c = 2 sin^2(c/2). Therefore, sqrt(1 - cos c) = sqrt(2) sin(c/2). Then sqrt(2) cos(0/2) = sqrt(2) * 1 = sqrt(2). So the argument inside the log at x=0 is sqrt(2) sin(c/2) + sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)(sin(c/2) + 1). But since we're dealing with the indefinite integral, the constant C cancels when evaluating definite integrals.\n\nHowever, in the integration by parts, we have I = c v(c) - ∫_{0}^{c} v(x) dx. Let's substitute v(c):\n\nI = c [ - sqrt(2) ln( sqrt(2) cos(c/2) ) ] - ∫_{0}^{c} [ - sqrt(2) ln( sqrt(cos x - cos c) + sqrt(2) cos(x/2) ) ] dx\n\nSimplify:\n\nI = - c sqrt(2) ln( sqrt(2) cos(c/2) ) + sqrt(2) ∫_{0}^{c} ln( sqrt(cos x - cos c) + sqrt(2) cos(x/2) ) dx\n\nThis seems even more complicated than before. Maybe this approach isn't fruitful. Perhaps another method is needed.\n\nLet me go back to the original integral and consider another substitution. Let me set theta = (c - x)/2. Wait, but this might not help. Alternatively, let's consider a substitution that can relate the integral to a known form. For instance, integrals involving sqrt(cos x - cos c) sometimes can be related to elliptical integrals, but since the answer is a logarithmic term, perhaps another approach.\n\nAnother idea: since the answer involves ln(sec(c/2)) = -ln(cos(c/2)), maybe there's a substitution that directly relates to this term. Let me consider a substitution where t = cos(c/2). Then, perhaps express the integral in terms of t. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider differentiating the integral with respect to c. Let me denote I(c) = ∫_{0}^{c} [x sin(x/2) / sqrt(cos x - cos c)] dx. Then, differentiate I(c) with respect to c:\n\nI’(c) = [c sin(c/2) / sqrt(cos c - cos c)] + ∫_{0}^{c} x sin(x/2) * [ (d/dc)(1 / sqrt(cos x - cos c)) ] dx\n\nBut sqrt(cos c - cos c) is 0, so the first term is problematic. Wait, actually, when differentiating an integral with variable limits and parameter, we use Leibniz's rule:\n\ndI/dc = [ integrand at x=c ] * dc/dc + ∫_{0}^{c} [ derivative of integrand with respect to c ]\n\nBut at x=c, the denominator sqrt(cos c - cos c) = 0, which makes the first term undefined. Therefore, differentiating under the integral sign might not be valid here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider making a substitution that transforms the integral into a standard form. Let me consider substituting u = cos x. Then du = -sin x dx. But the integrand has sin(x/2) dx, so sin(x/2) dx can be expressed as 2 sin(x/2) (dx/2), but not sure. Alternatively, express sin(x/2) in terms of sqrt((1 - cos x)/2). Let's try:\n\nsin(x/2) = sqrt( (1 - cos x)/2 ) = sqrt( (1 - u)/2 )\n\nThen, the integrand becomes x * sqrt( (1 - u)/2 ) / sqrt(u - cos c) * (- du / sin x )\n\nBut sin x = sqrt(1 - u^2). So:\n\nIntegral becomes:\n\n- ∫_{u=1}^{u=cos c} x * sqrt( (1 - u)/2 ) / sqrt(u - cos c) * du / sqrt(1 - u^2 )\n\n= - ∫_{1}^{cos c} x * sqrt( (1 - u)/2 ) / sqrt(u - cos c) * du / sqrt(1 - u^2 )\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\nsqrt( (1 - u)/2 ) / sqrt(1 - u^2) = sqrt( (1 - u)/2 ) / sqrt( (1 - u)(1 + u) )) = 1 / sqrt(2(1 + u))\n\nTherefore, the integrand simplifies to:\n\n- x / sqrt(2(1 + u)) / sqrt(u - cos c) )\n\n= - x / sqrt(2(1 + u)(u - cos c)) )\n\nBut x is a function of u, since u = cos x, so x = arccos u. Therefore, the integral becomes:\n\n- ∫_{1}^{cos c} [ arccos u / sqrt(2(1 + u)(u - cos c)) ] du\n\nThis still looks complicated, but maybe there's a substitution here. Let me set t = u - cos c. Then when u = cos c, t = 0; when u = 1, t = 1 - cos c. Then dt = du. The integral becomes:\n\n- ∫_{1 - cos c}^{0} [ arccos (t + cos c) / sqrt(2(1 + t + cos c) t) ] (-dt)\n\n= ∫_{0}^{1 - cos c} arccos (t + cos c) / sqrt(2(1 + t + cos c) t) dt\n\nBut arccos(t + cos c) is x, which would correspond to some angle, but it's unclear how to proceed.\n\nAnother thought: since the answer has a pi factor, perhaps the integral somehow relates to the integral of a logarithmic function over an interval that introduces pi. Alternatively, perhaps a substitution that inverts the trigonometric functions into logarithmic forms.\n\nWait, let's recall that the integral result is sqrt(2) pi ln(sec(c/2)). Sec(c/2) is 1/cos(c/2), so ln(sec(c/2)) = -ln(cos(c/2)). Therefore, the answer is -sqrt(2) pi ln(cos(c/2)). But since the original problem states it's equal to sqrt(2) pi ln(sec(c/2)), that's equivalent.\n\nThe presence of pi suggests that somewhere in the integration, we encounter an integral that evaluates to pi, possibly from integrating over a semicircle or integrating a function that results in pi.\n\nLet me try a different substitution. Let’s consider a substitution inspired by the denominator. Let’s set y = sqrt( (cos x - cos c) / (1 - cos c) ). This substitution scales the denominator such that when x = c, y = 0, and when x = 0, y = 1. Then dy/dx = [ -sin x / (2 sqrt(cos x - cos c)) ] * (1/(sqrt(1 - cos c))). Rearranging, sin x dx = -2 sqrt(cos x - cos c) sqrt(1 - cos c) dy. But I'm not sure if this helps, as we still have sin(x/2) in the numerator.\n\nAlternatively, consider that 1 - cos c = 2 sin^2(c/2), so sqrt(1 - cos c) = sqrt(2) sin(c/2). Therefore, y = sqrt( (cos x - cos c) / (2 sin^2(c/2)) ) = sqrt( (cos x - cos c) ) / ( sqrt(2) sin(c/2) )\n\nThen dy = [ -sin x / (2 sqrt(cos x - cos c)) ] dx / ( sqrt(2) sin(c/2) )\n\n=> dy = -sin x dx / ( 2 sqrt(cos x - cos c) * sqrt(2) sin(c/2) )\n\nBut the integrand has x sin(x/2) dx / sqrt(cos x - cos c). Let's solve for x sin(x/2) dx:\n\nFrom the expression for dy:\n\ndx = - (2 sqrt(cos x - cos c) * sqrt(2) sin(c/2) ) / sin x dy\n\nThus, x sin(x/2) dx = - x sin(x/2) * (2 sqrt(cos x - cos c) * sqrt(2) sin(c/2) ) / sin x dy\n\nThe integrand becomes:\n\n[ x sin(x/2) / sqrt(cos x - cos c) ] dx = - x sin(x/2) * (2 sqrt(cos x - cos c) * sqrt(2) sin(c/2) ) / ( sin x sqrt(cos x - cos c) ) dy\n\nSimplify:\n\n= - x sin(x/2) * 2 sqrt(2) sin(c/2) / sin x dy\n\nBut sin x = 2 sin(x/2) cos(x/2), so:\n\n= - x sin(x/2) * 2 sqrt(2) sin(c/2) / (2 sin(x/2) cos(x/2) ) dy\n\n= - x sqrt(2) sin(c/2) / cos(x/2) dy\n\nTherefore, the integral becomes:\n\n∫_{y=1}^{y=0} - x sqrt(2) sin(c/2) / cos(x/2) dy\n\n= sqrt(2) sin(c/2) ∫_{0}^{1} x / cos(x/2) dy\n\nBut x is a function of y, and we need to express x in terms of y. From the substitution:\n\ny = sqrt( (cos x - cos c) / (2 sin^2(c/2)) )\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\ny^2 = (cos x - cos c) / (2 sin^2(c/2))\n\n=> cos x = 2 y^2 sin^2(c/2) + cos c\n\nUsing the identity cos x = 1 - 2 sin^2(x/2), we get:\n\n1 - 2 sin^2(x/2) = 2 y^2 sin^2(c/2) + cos c\n\nBut cos c = 1 - 2 sin^2(c/2), so substituting:\n\n1 - 2 sin^2(x/2) = 2 y^2 sin^2(c/2) + 1 - 2 sin^2(c/2)\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\n-2 sin^2(x/2) = 2 y^2 sin^2(c/2) - 2 sin^2(c/2)\n\nDivide both sides by -2:\n\nsin^2(x/2) = sin^2(c/2) - y^2 sin^2(c/2) = sin^2(c/2)(1 - y^2)\n\nTherefore, sin(x/2) = sin(c/2) sqrt(1 - y^2)\n\nTaking arcsin:\n\nx/2 = arcsin( sin(c/2) sqrt(1 - y^2) )\n\nThus, x = 2 arcsin( sin(c/2) sqrt(1 - y^2) )\n\nThis expression for x seems complicated, but maybe we can proceed.\n\nNow, we need to express x / cos(x/2) in terms of y. Let's compute cos(x/2):\n\nFrom sin(x/2) = sin(c/2) sqrt(1 - y^2), we have:\n\ncos(x/2) = sqrt(1 - sin^2(x/2)) = sqrt(1 - sin^2(c/2)(1 - y^2)).\n\nBut sin^2(c/2)(1 - y^2) = sin^2(c/2) - sin^2(c/2) y^2.\n\nThus,\n\ncos(x/2) = sqrt(1 - sin^2(c/2) + sin^2(c/2) y^2 )\n\n= sqrt( cos^2(c/2) + sin^2(c/2) y^2 )\n\nTherefore, x / cos(x/2) = [ 2 arcsin( sin(c/2) sqrt(1 - y^2) ) ] / sqrt( cos^2(c/2) + sin^2(c/2) y^2 )\n\nThis is quite complex, but perhaps there's a simplification. Let me denote k = sin(c/2), so cos(c/2) = sqrt(1 - k^2). Then the expression becomes:\n\nx / cos(x/2) = 2 arcsin( k sqrt(1 - y^2) ) / sqrt( (1 - k^2) + k^2 y^2 )\n\nHmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe this substitution hasn't simplified things as hoped. This seems to lead to an integral that's not elementary, so perhaps this path isn't the right one.\n\nGiven that I've tried several substitutions and methods without luck, maybe I need to look for a different approach entirely. Let me think about known integrals that result in logarithmic terms with pi factors. For example, integrals involving inverse trigonometric functions or logarithmic integrals over trigonometric functions.\n\nAnother idea: Let's consider expanding the numerator x sin(x/2) into a series and integrating term by term. However, this might not be the most efficient method, and convergence could be an issue.\n\nAlternatively, recall that the integral might be related to the derivative of some function with respect to a parameter. For example, if we can express the integral in terms of a parameter that when differentiated, yields a manageable expression.\n\nAlternatively, consider a substitution that converts the integral into a standard integral that's known to result in a logarithmic term. For example, integrals of the form ∫ t / sqrt(a^2 - t^2) dt lead to sqrt(a^2 - t^2), but not log terms. However, integrals involving 1/(t) dt lead to log terms.\n\nWait, perhaps after a substitution, we can get an integral that has 1/t dt. Let me think.\n\nLet me try another substitution. Let’s set t = sqrt(cos x - cos c). Then t^2 = cos x - cos c. Differentiating, 2t dt = -sin x dx. But we have sin(x/2) in the numerator. Express sin x = 2 sin(x/2) cos(x/2). Then 2t dt = -2 sin(x/2) cos(x/2) dx → t dt = - sin(x/2) cos(x/2) dx → dx = - t dt / ( sin(x/2) cos(x/2) )\n\nNow, substitute into the integral:\n\nI = ∫ x sin(x/2) / t * dx = ∫ x sin(x/2) / t * ( - t dt / ( sin(x/2) cos(x/2) ) )\n\nSimplify:\n\n= - ∫ x / cos(x/2) dt\n\nBut x is related to t through t^2 = cos x - cos c. So we need to express x in terms of t. Let’s solve for x:\n\nFrom t^2 = cos x - cos c → cos x = t^2 + cos c → x = arccos(t^2 + cos c)\n\nTherefore, x = arccos(t^2 + cos c)\n\nNow, cos(x/2) can be expressed using the half-angle formula:\n\ncos(x/2) = sqrt( (1 + cos x)/2 ) = sqrt( (1 + t^2 + cos c)/2 )\n\nTherefore, the integral becomes:\n\nI = - ∫ arccos(t^2 + cos c) / sqrt( (1 + t^2 + cos c)/2 ) dt\n\n= - sqrt(2) ∫ arccos(t^2 + cos c) / sqrt(1 + t^2 + cos c) dt\n\nThis still seems complicated. Maybe if we change variables here. Let’s set u = t^2 + cos c. Then du = 2t dt. But we have arccos(u) / sqrt(1 + u) dt. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider that 1 + u = 1 + t^2 + cos c. Hmm, not helpful.\n\nGiven that this approach hasn't simplified things, perhaps it's time to consult known integral formulas or look for a clever substitution that I might have missed.\n\nWait, here's another idea: Let me recall that integrals involving x and trigonometric functions sometimes can be expressed using integration by parts where one part is the integral of the trigonometric function. Perhaps using substitution followed by integration by parts.\n\nLet me try substitution first. Let's set t = cos x - cos c. Then, as before, dt = -sin x dx. But we need to express x in terms of t, which seems difficult. However, perhaps we can express x as a function of t and proceed.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider integrating by parts with a different choice of u and dv. Let’s take u = x, dv = sin(x/2) / sqrt(cos x - cos c) dx. We tried this earlier, but maybe we can evaluate v(x) differently.\n\nWait, previously, we found that v(x) = - sqrt(2) ln( sqrt(cos x - cos c) + sqrt(2) cos(x/2) ) + C. When evaluated from 0 to c, the expression at x = c is sqrt(2) ln( sqrt(2) cos(c/2) ), and at x = 0, we have sqrt(1 - cos c) + sqrt(2) cos(0/2) = sqrt(2) sin(c/2) + sqrt(2). Therefore, the definite integral v(x) from 0 to c is:\n\nv(c) - v(0) = - sqrt(2) [ ln( sqrt(2) cos(c/2) ) - ln( sqrt(2) sin(c/2) + sqrt(2) ) ]\n\n= - sqrt(2) ln[ (sqrt(2) cos(c/2)) / (sqrt(2)(sin(c/2) + 1)) ]\n\n= - sqrt(2) ln[ cos(c/2) / (sin(c/2) + 1) ]\n\nBut this seems complicated. However, if we proceed with integration by parts:\n\nI = [x v(x)]_{0}^{c} - ∫_{0}^{c} v(x) dx\n\nAs before, I = c v(c) - ∫_{0}^{c} v(x) dx\n\nBut the remaining integral ∫ v(x) dx seems difficult. Unless there's a cancellation or another substitution that can be applied here. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, perhaps I need to consider that there's a different substitution or method.\n\nWait, going back to the answer: sqrt(2) pi ln(sec(c/2)). Let me note that pi often appears in integrals involving definite integrals from 0 to pi/2 or similar ranges. Since our integral is from 0 to c where 0 < c < pi, maybe a substitution that maps the interval to a standard interval.\n\nLet me consider a substitution that relates x to another angle such as theta = pi - x or something. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the integral might be related to the integral of secant or some logarithmic integral. For example, ∫ sec theta d theta = ln |sec theta + tan theta| + C. But how to relate this to the given integral.\n\nAnother idea: Use the substitution phi = x/2. Then x = 2 phi, dx = 2 d phi. The integral becomes:\n\n∫_{0}^{c/2} (2 phi) sin(phi) / sqrt(cos(2 phi) - cos c) * 2 d phi\n\n= 4 ∫_{0}^{c/2} phi sin phi / sqrt(cos 2 phi - cos c) d phi\n\nBut cos 2 phi - cos c can be expressed using sum-to-product identities:\n\ncos 2 phi - cos c = -2 sin( (2 phi + c)/2 ) sin( (2 phi - c)/2 )\n\nBut since the denominator is sqrt(cos 2 phi - cos c), this might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, express cos 2 phi as 1 - 2 sin^2 phi. Then:\n\ncos 2 phi - cos c = 1 - 2 sin^2 phi - cos c = (1 - cos c) - 2 sin^2 phi = 2 sin^2(c/2) - 2 sin^2 phi\n\n= 2 [ sin^2(c/2) - sin^2 phi ]\n\n= 2 [ (sin(c/2) - sin phi)(sin(c/2) + sin phi) ]\n\nSo sqrt(cos 2 phi - cos c) = sqrt(2) sqrt( (sin(c/2) - sin phi)(sin(c/2) + sin phi) )\n\nThis expression resembles the product of differences and sums, which might be useful. Let me set t = sin phi. Then dt = cos phi d phi. When phi = 0, t = 0; when phi = c/2, t = sin(c/2). The integral becomes:\n\n4 ∫_{0}^{sin(c/2)} arcsin(t) * t / sqrt(2) sqrt( (sin(c/2) - t)(sin(c/2) + t) ) * dt / cos phi\n\nBut cos phi = sqrt(1 - t^2). So the integral becomes:\n\n4 / sqrt(2) ∫_{0}^{sin(c/2)} arcsin(t) * t / sqrt( (sin^2(c/2) - t^2) (1 - t^2) ) dt\n\nThis looks very complicated, but maybe there's a substitution here. Let me set u = t / sin(c/2). Then t = u sin(c/2), dt = sin(c/2) du. When t = 0, u = 0; t = sin(c/2), u = 1. The integral becomes:\n\n4 / sqrt(2) ∫_{0}^{1} arcsin(u sin(c/2)) * u sin(c/2) / sqrt( (sin^2(c/2) - u^2 sin^2(c/2)) (1 - u^2 sin^2(c/2)) ) * sin(c/2) du\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n\nsqrt( sin^2(c/2)(1 - u^2) * (1 - u^2 sin^2(c/2)) )\n\n= sin(c/2) sqrt( (1 - u^2) (1 - u^2 sin^2(c/2)) )\n\nTherefore, the integral becomes:\n\n4 / sqrt(2) * sin(c/2) * sin(c/2) ∫_{0}^{1} arcsin(u sin(c/2)) * u / [ sin(c/2) sqrt( (1 - u^2) (1 - u^2 sin^2(c/2)) ) ] du\n\nSimplify:\n\n= 4 / sqrt(2) * sin(c/2) ∫_{0}^{1} arcsin(u sin(c/2)) * u / sqrt( (1 - u^2) (1 - u^2 sin^2(c/2)) ) du\n\n= 2 sqrt(2) sin(c/2) ∫_{0}^{1} arcsin(u sin(c/2)) * u / sqrt( (1 - u^2) (1 - u^2 sin^2(c/2)) ) du\n\nThis still seems quite involved. Perhaps this substitution isn't leading us anywhere useful.\n\nGiven the time I've invested without success, I think I need to consider that there's a clever substitution or identity I'm missing. Let me search my memory for integrals involving x sin x over sqrt(cos x - cos c).\n\nWait, another idea: Let's consider splitting the integral into two parts. Maybe by expressing x as a sum or integrating over a different variable. Alternatively, consider the integral's behavior under a particular substitution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider representing x in terms of an integral. For example, x = ∫_{0}^{x} 1 dt, and interchange the order of integration. Let's see:\n\nI = ∫_{0}^{c} [ x sin(x/2) / sqrt(cos x - cos c) ] dx\n\n= ∫_{0}^{c} [ ∫_{0}^{x} 1 dt ] [ sin(x/2) / sqrt(cos x - cos c) ] dx\n\n= ∫_{0}^{c} ∫_{0}^{x} [ sin(x/2) / sqrt(cos x - cos c) ] dt dx\n\nInterchanging the order of integration:\n\n= ∫_{0}^{c} ∫_{t}^{c} [ sin(x/2) / sqrt(cos x - cos c) ] dx dt\n\nNow, the inner integral is ∫_{t}^{c} sin(x/2) / sqrt(cos x - cos c) dx. Let me compute this inner integral.\n\nLet’s set u = cos x - cos c. Then du = -sin x dx. But we have sin(x/2) dx. Let me express sin x in terms of sin(x/2):\n\nsin x = 2 sin(x/2) cos(x/2). So du = -2 sin(x/2) cos(x/2) dx → sin(x/2) dx = - du / (2 cos(x/2))\n\nBut the integral becomes ∫ sin(x/2) dx / sqrt(u) = ∫ (- du) / (2 cos(x/2) sqrt(u))\n\nBut u = cos x - cos c. Express cos(x/2) in terms of u:\n\ncos x = u + cos c. Using the double-angle formula: cos x = 2 cos^2(x/2) - 1 → u + cos c = 2 cos^2(x/2) - 1 → cos^2(x/2) = (u + cos c + 1)/2 → cos(x/2) = sqrt( (u + cos c + 1)/2 )\n\nTherefore, the integral becomes:\n\n- ∫ [ 1 / (2 sqrt( (u + cos c + 1)/2 )) ] * du / sqrt(u)\n\n= - ∫ [ 1 / sqrt(2(u + cos c + 1)) ] * du / sqrt(u)\n\n= - ∫ du / sqrt(2 u (u + cos c + 1))\n\nLet me substitute v = sqrt(u). Then u = v^2, du = 2v dv. The integral becomes:\n\n- ∫ 2v dv / sqrt(2 v^2 (v^2 + cos c + 1) )\n\n= - ∫ 2v dv / (v sqrt(2 (v^2 + cos c + 1)) )\n\n= - ∫ 2 dv / sq",
