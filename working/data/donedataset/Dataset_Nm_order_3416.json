    "Content": "Main Question A very common form of Cauchy's integral theorem is Let $A\\subset\\mathbf{C}$ be simply connected and open, $f:A\\rightarrow\\mathbf{C}$ analytic, $I$ a compact interval, and $\\gamma:I\\rightarrow A$ continuous (or whatever) with $\\gamma(I)\\subset A$ . Then $\\int_\\gamma f(z)dz=0$ . I think it would also suffice (and not make the proof any harder) to assume that $\\gamma$ is homotopic in $A$ to a point without requiring that $A$ is simply connected. Am I correct? If so, why is it never (or seldom) stated this way? The same applies to the residue theorem and other related theorems of complex analysis. Related I would be less surprised if the following statement was completely obvious: Let $A\\subset\\mathbf{C}$ open, $I$ a compact interval, and $\\gamma:I\\rightarrow A$ a continuous path homotopic in $A$ to a point. Then there exists $U\\subset A$ open and simply connected with $\\gamma(I)\\subset U$ . I suspect this is true, and I have a vague idea how to prove it. But it's not a one-liner and I don't remember seeing it in any textbook. Am I missing something?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, the user wants me to format the question from Math Stack Exchange according to the specified structure. The original question is about why certain theorems in complex analysis, like Cauchy's integral theorem and the residue theorem, require the domain to be simply connected instead of just assuming the curve is homotopic to a point.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. The user provided an example where they listed assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. \n\nLooking at the main question, the user mentions Cauchy's integral theorem. The theorem as stated requires the domain A to be simply connected and open, f to be analytic on A, and γ to be a continuous (or smooth) curve in A. The user is suggesting that instead of requiring A to be simply connected, it might suffice to assume that γ is homotopic to a point in A. They then ask if this is correct and why it's not stated that way.\n\nThe related part of the question talks about whether if γ is homotopic to a point in A, there exists a simply connected open subset U of A containing γ(I). The user thinks this is true but not trivial.\n\nSo, the assumptions here would be the conditions given in the theorem and the alternative conditions the user is proposing. The problem is why theorems require the domain to be simply connected instead of the homotopy condition on the curve.\n\nBut wait, the task is to structure the problem as per the format. The user wants to present the problem as assumptions and the problem statement. The original question is more of a \"why is it stated this way\" rather than a direct problem to prove something. However, the user is questioning the necessity of the simply connected assumption versus the homotopy condition.\n\nHmm. The example given by the user was about proving a number is divisible by 91, with assumptions listed. Here, the problem is more of a conceptual question. But according to the format, we need to list assumptions and then state the problem. So, let's try to break down the main question.\n\nThe original theorem's assumptions are:\n- A is an open, simply connected subset of C.\n- f: A → C is analytic.\n- γ is a continuous (or smooth) curve in A.\n\nBut the user suggests that instead of A being simply connected, maybe it's enough that γ is homotopic to a point in A. So the problem is asking whether this alternative assumption is sufficient and why theorems aren't stated that way.\n\nAdditionally, the related question is whether if γ is homotopic to a point in A, there exists a simply connected U subset of A containing γ(I). So, perhaps the assumptions there would be:\n- A is open in C.\n- γ is a continuous path in A that's homotopic to a point in A.\nAnd the problem would be to prove the existence of such a U.\n\nBut the main problem the user is posing is why theorems require the domain to be simply connected instead of the homotopy condition. So perhaps the assumptions for the main problem are the ones in the theorem, and the alternative assumption.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is to determine whether the homotopy condition of γ in A is sufficient instead of A being simply connected. So the problem would be: Is it sufficient to assume that γ is homotopic to a point in A instead of A being simply connected? If so, why isn't it stated that way?\n\nBut according to the format, we need to list the assumptions and then the problem. So let's structure it.\n\nFor the main question:\nAssumptions:\n- A is an open subset of C.\n- f: A → C is analytic.\n- γ: I → A is a continuous path.\n- γ is homotopic in A to a point.\n\nProblem: Prove that ∫γ f(z)dz = 0.\n\nBut the original theorem states that if A is simply connected, then the integral is zero. The user is asking whether the homotopy condition alone suffices. So perhaps the problem is to show that if γ is homotopic to a point in A (without A being simply connected), then the integral is zero. And why is the theorem not stated this way.\n\nBut the user also mentions the residue theorem and others. However, focusing on the Cauchy's theorem part.\n\nSo the assumptions would be the standard ones except replacing \"A is simply connected\" with \"γ is homotopic to a point in A\".\n\nTherefore, formatted:\n\nAssumption:\nA is an open subset of C,\nf is analytic on A,\nγ is a continuous path in A,\nγ is homotopic in A to a point.\n\nProblem: Prove that ∫γ f(z)dz = 0.\n\nBut the original problem is not to prove it, but to ask why theorems require A to be simply connected instead of using the homotopy condition. However, according to the example provided, the problem was to \"prove that...\". Here, the user is questioning the necessity of the domain's simple connectivity versus the curve's homotopy. But perhaps the structured problem is to verify whether the homotopy condition suffices.\n\nAlternatively, the related question is about the existence of a simply connected U containing γ(I) if γ is homotopic to a point. That might be another problem.\n\nBut the user's original main question is twofold: first, whether the homotopy condition suffices for Cauchy's theorem, and second, why it's not stated that way. But the format requires a problem statement, so perhaps the problem is to determine whether the homotopy condition is sufficient, and if so, why the standard theorem requires simple connectivity.\n\nBut according to the example, the problem is a statement to prove. Here, the user's question is more of a \"why\" question. However, perhaps the structured problem would be to show that if γ is homotopic to a point in A, then the integral is zero, hence proving the sufficiency of the homotopy condition. But the user is asserting that it's possible and asking why it's not stated that way.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be phrased as asking why theorems require the entire domain to be simply connected rather than just the curve being homotopic to a point. But in the example, the problem was to prove a divisibility. Here, perhaps the problem is to justify the necessity of the simply connected domain assumption.\n\nBut the user's main point is to question the necessity of the simply connected assumption. Therefore, the problem might be phrased as: \"Why is the assumption that the domain A is simply connected required in Cauchy's integral theorem, instead of assuming the curve γ is homotopic to a point in A?\" However, in the format provided, the problem should be a statement to prove or address. The example's problem was to prove something. Here, the question is more about understanding the reasoning behind the theorem's hypotheses. But maybe the structured problem is to show that the homotopy condition implies the integral is zero, hence making the simply connected assumption redundant.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be structured as the user's original question: \"Why do we require the entire domain to be simply connected in Cauchy's theorem, residue theorem, etc., instead of assuming the curve is homotopic to a point?\" But the example's problem was a statement to prove. Perhaps we need to rephrase the question into a problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, the related part of the question is about proving the existence of a simply connected U containing γ(I) if γ is homotopic to a point. So perhaps that's a separate problem.\n\nGiven that, maybe we need to split into two problems. But the user's main question is the first part.\n\nBut according to the instructions, I should filter the unrelated information and structure the problem as per the format. The example took the original problem, listed assumptions, and then the problem. The original question here has two parts: the main question and the related question.\n\nFocusing on the main question: Why is the domain required to be simply connected instead of assuming the curve is homotopic to a point. The user suggests that the homotopy condition might suffice and asks why it's not stated that way.\n\nIn terms of the format, perhaps the assumptions would be the ones from the theorem, but then the problem is to determine whether the simply connected assumption can be replaced by the homotopy condition.\n\nBut how to phrase it as a problem? Maybe:\n\nProblem: Determine whether the assumption that A is simply connected can be replaced by the condition that γ is homotopic to a point in A in Cauchy's integral theorem.\n\nBut the example's problem was to \"prove that...\". Here, the problem is more of a \"determine\" or \"show why\". However, perhaps the structured problem would be to show that if γ is homotopic to a point in A, then the integral is zero, even if A is not simply connected.\n\nAlternatively, if the user is correct that the homotopy condition suffices, then the problem would be to prove that under the homotopy condition, the integral is zero. Hence, the structured problem would be to prove that under the homotopy assumption, the integral vanishes, and hence, the simply connected assumption is unnecessary. However, the answer might involve explaining that in a non-simply connected domain, even if a particular curve is homotopic to a point, other curves might not be, so the theorem's statement requires the domain to ensure all curves have this property.\n\nBut the user's main point is whether the homotopy condition is sufficient for that particular curve. The answer would be yes, but the reason theorems state the domain as simply connected is to have a general condition that applies to all curves. However, structuring this as a problem would require formulating it as a proof.\n\nAlternatively, considering the related question: if γ is homotopic to a point in A, is there a simply connected U containing γ(I)? If that's true, then perhaps one can apply the standard theorem to U, hence showing that the integral is zero. Therefore, the problem could be to prove that existence of such U, which would then allow the application of Cauchy's theorem in U.\n\nSo perhaps the structured problem for the related part is:\n\nAssumption:\nA is an open subset of C,\nγ is a continuous path in A,\nγ is homotopic in A to a point.\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists an open simply connected subset U of A such that γ(I) ⊂ U.\n\nIf this is proven, then the integral over γ would be zero by applying Cauchy's theorem to U.\n\nTherefore, the main problem is to show that the homotopy condition implies the existence of a simply connected neighborhood, hence allowing the theorem to hold without the entire domain being simply connected.\n\nPutting it all together, the original question has two parts. However, the user's instruction is to \"structure that problem as the following format\" with assumptions and problem. Given the example, it's likely that each part (main question and related question) might be separate, but since the user provided one example, perhaps focusing on the main question first.\n\nBut the user's original question is a bit more complex. Let me check the example again. The example took the original problem, extracted the key assumptions, and restated the problem. Here, the original problem is questioning the necessity of simply connected domain versus homotopy of the curve.\n\nSo perhaps the assumptions for the main question are the standard theorem's assumptions, and the problem is to question why the simply connected condition is required instead of the homotopy.\n\nBut the format requires the problem to be a statement to prove. Alternatively, the problem could be phrased as: \"Show that the assumption that γ is homotopic to a point in A is sufficient for ∫γ f(z)dz = 0, hence making the simply connected condition on A unnecessary.\"\n\nBut in reality, the homotopy version of Cauchy's theorem does require the homotopy to be within the domain A. So, if A is not simply connected, but a particular curve γ is homotopic to a point in A, then the integral over γ is zero. Therefore, the standard theorem's assumption of A being simply connected ensures that every closed curve is homotopic to a point. So the homotopy condition is more general for individual curves.\n\nTherefore, the problem could be structured as:\n\nAssumption:\nA is an open subset of C,\nf is analytic on A,\nγ is a closed continuous path in A,\nγ is homotopic in A to a point.\n\nProblem: Prove that ∫γ f(z)dz = 0.\n\nBut then the question is why the standard theorem requires A to be simply connected. The answer is that simple connectivity ensures that every closed curve is homotopic to a point, but the theorem can indeed be stated for individual curves that are homotopic to a point. However, the user is asking why it's seldom stated that way.\n\nBut the structured problem according to the example would be the one to prove the integral is zero under the homotopy assumption.\n\nAlternatively, if the user is correct that the homotopy condition suffices, then the problem is to prove that. Therefore, the formatted problem would have the homotopy as an assumption instead of simple connectivity.\n\nYes, the example had assumptions listed line by line. So for the main question, the original theorem assumes A is simply connected, open; f is analytic; γ is a closed path in A. The user suggests replacing the simply connected assumption with γ being homotopic to a point. So the formatted problem would have those assumptions, leading to the same conclusion.\n\nThus:\n\nAssumption:\nA is an open subset of C,\nf is analytic on A,\nγ is a continuous closed path in A,\nγ is homotopic in A to a point.\n\nProblem: Prove that ∫γ f(z)dz = 0.\n\nThis fits the format. Each assumption is one line, addressing one property. The problem is to prove the integral is zero.\n\nThe related question is about the existence of a simply connected U containing γ(I) if γ is homotopic to a point. So for that:\n\nAssumption:\nA is an open subset of C,\nγ is a continuous path in A,\nγ is homotopic in A to a point.\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists an open simply connected subset U of A such that γ(I) ⊂ U.\n\nTherefore, the user has two problems embedded in their question. However, since the original instruction is to present the problem in the given format, perhaps the main question is the first one, and the related is the second. But the user's example only included one problem. Given that, perhaps structuring both as separate problems, but the user's original post is one question.\n\nAlternatively, the main problem is the first, and the related is a supporting lemma. Since the user's question is about why theorems are stated with simply connected domains instead of homotopy, and the related question is about the existence of U, which might be the reason.\n\nBut according to the instructions, the task is to read the Math Stack Exchange question, filter unrelated info, and structure it as per the format. The example included only the main problem, not the related parts. However, in the given problem, the user mentions two parts: the main question and the related question.\n\nBut perhaps the answer should include both as separate problems. However, the example provided by the user only had one problem. Let me check the original instruction again: \"structure that problem as the following format\". The example had one problem. The user's question here might have two parts, but perhaps they should be structured separately.\n\nBut since the user's original question on Math Stack Exchange combines both, maybe it's better to present both as separate problems in the formatted output.\n\nHowever, the assistant is supposed to output one formatted problem. Given the example, perhaps focus on the main question.\n\nSo, to sum up, the main problem in the formatted structure would be:\n\nAssumption:\nA is an open subset of C,\nf is analytic on A,\nγ is a continuous closed path in A,\nγ is homotopic in A to a point.\n\nProblem: Prove that ∫γ f(z)dz = 0.\n\nAnd the related problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nA is an open subset of C,\nγ is a continuous path in A,\nγ is homotopic in A to a point.\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists an open simply connected subset U of A such that γ(I) ⊂ U.\n\nBut according to the user's instructions, they provided one example. It's unclear whether to include both. Given the original question has two parts, but the example had one, perhaps structure each part as a separate problem. However, the user might expect both to be formatted. Alternatively, maybe the main question is the first, and the related is part of the context.\n\nBut given the example, I think the assistant should structure each problem separately. However, due to the instruction's ambiguity, perhaps focus on the main question.\n\nAnother point: the original theorem's assumption is that A is simply connected, which makes every closed curve homotopic to a point. The user's suggestion is that for a single curve γ, being homotopic to a point is enough, making the integral zero. So the problem is to prove Cauchy's theorem under the homotopy condition instead of the domain's simple connectivity.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nA is an open subset of C,\nf is analytic on A,\nγ is a continuous closed path in A,\nγ is homotopic in A to a point.\n\nProblem: Prove that ∫γ f(z)dz = 0.\n\nThis fits the format. Each assumption is on a separate line, addressing one property. The problem is to prove the integral is zero. This matches the example's style, where the problem was to prove something under certain assumptions.\n\nThe related question about the existence of a simply connected U would be another problem, structured similarly:\n\nAssumption:\nA is an open subset of C,\nγ is a continuous path in A,\nγ is homotopic in A to a point.\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists an open simply connected subset U of A such that γ(I) ⊂ U.\n\nBut since the user's original post includes both questions, perhaps both should be formatted. However, the example given by the user only included one problem. Given that, maybe the assistant should present both as separate formatted problems.\n\nBut the instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\", implying one problem per structured entry. However, the original question contains two related problems. Perhaps the answer should include both. But since the user's example only had one, maybe the intended answer is to structure each separately. However, the user's original question combines both, so perhaps it's acceptable to present both.\n\nBut given the example, perhaps the answer should focus on the main question first.
