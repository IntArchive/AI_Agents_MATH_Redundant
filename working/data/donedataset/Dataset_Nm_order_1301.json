    "Content": "I am trying to show that $\\lim_{n\\to \\infty}{\\frac{2n\\choose n}{4^n}}=0$. I found that using stirling's approximation, I can get:\n$$\n\\lim_{n\\to \\infty}{\\frac{2n\\choose n}{4^n}}=\n\\lim_{n\\to \\infty}{\\frac{(2n)!}{n!^2*2^{2n}}}=\n\\lim_{n\\to \\infty}{\\frac{(\\frac{2n}{e})^{2n}\\sqrt{2\\pi (2n)}}{((\\frac{n}{e})^n\\sqrt{2\\pi n})^2*2^{2n}}}\n=\\lim_{n\\to \\infty}{\\frac{2\\sqrt{\\pi n}}{2\\pi n}}\n=0\n$$ But this seems inelegant where there should be a more elegant, combinatorial proof. Is there an easier way?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Not a combinatorial approach, but a fun way of doing it is showing that $$\\frac{\\binom{2n}{n}}{4^n}=\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_0^{2\\pi} \\cos^{2n} x\\; dx$$ Basically, writing $\\cos x = \\frac12\\left(e^{ix}+e^{-ix}\\right)$. So $\\cos^{2n} x$ has constant term $\\binom{2n}{n}/4^n$. Since $\\cos^{2n} x\\to 0$ for almost all $x$, it is pretty easy to show that the above integral tends to zero as $n\\to\\infty$. Specifically, on the intervals $(\\varepsilon,\\pi-\\varepsilon)\\cup(\\pi+\\varepsilon,2\\pi-\\varepsilon)$, $\\cos^{2n}x\\to 0$ uniformly.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to format the Math Stack Exchange question according to the given example. The original problem is about showing that the limit of the central binomial coefficient divided by 4^n is zero using a combinatorial proof instead of Stirling's approximation.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The example listed each assumption line by line, addressing only one property per line. In the original problem, the user mentioned using Stirling's approximation but seeks a combinatorial approach. However, the problem itself doesn't state any explicit assumptions beyond the limit as n approaches infinity. Wait, the problem statement is about the limit, so the main assumption is that n is approaching infinity. But in the example, they listed assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, maybe the assumption is that n is a positive integer going to infinity. Since the problem is about combinatorics, n being a positive integer is inherent, but maybe the user wants that listed. Let me check the example again. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. In the current problem, the only assumption is that n is a positive integer approaching infinity. However, in the original problem statement, the user didn't specify any divisibility conditions, so perhaps the only assumption is that n is an integer approaching infinity. But in the example, they included \"n is an integer\" as a separate assumption. So here, perhaps we should list \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, even though it's implied. But the problem is about the limit as n approaches infinity, so maybe that's part of the problem statement. Let me look at the problem statement again: \"Combinatorially showing lim_{n→∞} (2n choose n)/4^n =0\". The problem is to show that the limit is zero. The assumptions would be that n is an integer and n approaches infinity. Wait, but in the example, the assumption included a condition on n (divisible by 7), but here there's no such condition. So perhaps the only assumption is that n is an integer. But in the problem statement, the limit is as n approaches infinity, which is part of the problem's nature. Therefore, in the assumptions, maybe just \"n is an integer\". However, the original problem as stated by the user didn't have any specific conditions on n except being in the limit. So perhaps the assumption is simply that n is a positive integer. But maybe the problem doesn't require any specific assumptions beyond n being an integer. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem had assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like the user modified the original problem's assumptions. Wait no, the original problem in the example was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n)...\" but the formatted problem had assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the example was a typo or an error? Wait the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". That would mean that in the formatted problem, the user added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. But that's not in the original problem. Wait, maybe the example was a different problem. Let me check again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Then the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. Wait, but 91 is 7*13. If n is divisible by 7, then perhaps the problem is a modified version. Maybe the example was a different problem where the original was for every integer n, but the formatted problem had an extra assumption. So maybe in the example, the user made a mistake, or perhaps the original problem had a typo. Anyway, perhaps in the current problem, the only assumption is that n is an integer. But since the problem is about the limit as n approaches infinity, maybe that's part of the problem statement and not an assumption. The user is asking for the structure where assumptions are listed line by line. In this case, since the problem is about the limit as n approaches infinity, perhaps the assumption is that n is an integer. Alternatively, maybe there are no specific assumptions beyond what's in the problem statement. Wait, the example had two assumptions, but in the current problem, perhaps there are none? Hmm, maybe the example was a different case. Let's think again. The problem is to show that the limit as n approaches infinity of (2n choose n)/4^n is zero. The problem itself doesn't state any specific conditions on n other than it being in the limit. The user's question mentions that Stirling's approximation was used but seeks a combinatorial proof. So, the formatted problem's assumption would be that n is an integer (since the problem is about integer n in combinatorics). So, in the assumption section, we list \"n is an integer\". Then the problem is as stated. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\lim_{n\\to \\infty}{\\frac{\\binom{2n}{n}}{4^n}}=0.$$\n\nBut wait, in the example, the original problem had an extra assumption (divisible by 7) which wasn't in the original question. So maybe in this case, the problem is as stated, and the assumption is just that n is an integer. Since the problem is about the limit, which inherently involves n approaching infinity, that's part of the problem statement. Therefore, the assumption is that n is an integer. Hence, the formatted problem would be as above. Alternatively, maybe there's another assumption. Let me check the problem again. The problem is to show the limit is zero. The user used Stirling's approximation but wants a combinatorial proof. The problem itself doesn't have any other conditions. Therefore, the only assumption is n is an integer. Hence, the formatted problem should list that assumption. So, the answer would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\lim_{n\\to \\infty}{\\frac{\\dbinom{2n}{n}}{4^n}}=0.$$\n###",
