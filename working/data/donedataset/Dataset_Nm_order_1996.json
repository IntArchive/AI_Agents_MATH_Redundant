    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original problem is about evaluating the integral from 0 to π of x times f(sin x) dx and showing it's equal to half pi times the integral of f(sin x) dx from 0 to π. \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. Each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. Let me read the question again. The problem states that f(sin x) is a given function of sin x. So one assumption is that f is a function of sin x. That's important because the substitution might rely on properties of sine functions over the interval [0, π]. \n\nAnother thing to consider: the limits of integration are from 0 to π. Sometimes, integrals over symmetric intervals can use substitution techniques. For example, using substitution like u = π - x might be helpful here. Let me think. If we let u = π - x, then when x = 0, u = π, and when x = π, u = 0. The differential du would be -dx, so the integral becomes from π to 0, but flipping the limits would remove the negative sign. \n\nSo substituting u = π - x into the original integral ∫₀^π x f(sin x) dx. Then, the integral becomes ∫₀^π (π - u) f(sin u) du. If we add the original integral and this substituted version, we get ∫₀^π x f(sin x) dx + ∫₀^π (π - x) f(sin x) dx = ∫₀^π π f(sin x) dx. This simplifies to π ∫₀^π f(sin x) dx = 2 ∫₀^π x f(sin x) dx. Therefore, solving for the original integral gives (π/2) ∫₀^π f(sin x) dx. \n\nBut wait, this substitution technique works here because sin(π - x) = sin x, which makes f(sin(π - x)) = f(sin x). So the function f(sin x) is symmetric around x = π/2. That's probably a key assumption here. So the assumptions would include that f is a function of sin x, which allows the substitution to work because sin x is symmetric in the interval [0, π]. \n\nAlso, the integral is over the interval [0, π], which is the full period of the sine function where it's symmetric. So another assumption is that the integral is taken over the interval from 0 to π. \n\nBut the problem as stated doesn't mention any specific conditions on f other than it's a function of sin x. So maybe the only assumptions are that f is a function of sin x, and the integral is over [0, π]. However, in the example given, the assumption was split into two lines: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. So here, the assumptions might be:\n\n- f is a function of sin x.\n- The integral is taken over the interval [0, π].\n\nWait, but the problem is to show the equality. So the key conditions are that f is a function of sin x, and the integration bounds are from 0 to π. Each of these is a separate assumption. Therefore, in the Assumption section, each line should have one property or condition applied to one object. So f is a function of sin x (applied to f), and the integral is over [0, π] (applied to the integral). \n\nSo the formatted problem should have these two assumptions. Let me check the example again. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Both applied to n. Here, the first is about f, the second about the integral. So yes, that's acceptable. Each line is one condition applied to one object. \n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a function of $\\sin x$,\nthe integral is evaluated over the interval $[0, \\pi]$.\n\nProblem: Show that $$\\int_0^\\pi x f(\\sin x)\\,dx = \\frac{1}{2}\\pi \\int_0^\\pi f(\\sin x)\\,dx.$$\n\nI think that's correct. The key here is recognizing that the substitution u = π - x works because sin(π - x) = sin x, and integrating over the symmetric interval allows combining the integrals. So the assumptions are correctly captured.",
