    "Content": "Let $T^2\\subset\\mathbb{C}^2$ denote the (usual) torus. Let $a\\in\\mathbb{R}$ be an irrational number and define a map $f(t)=(e^{2\\pi it}, e^{2\\pi i at})$. Prove that: (a) $f$ is injective (b) $f$ is an immersion, but not an embedding (c) $f(\\mathbb{R})$ is dense in $T^2$ (d) $f(\\mathbb{R})$ is not an embedded submanifold of $T^2$ I've already shown (a) and (b), but (c) has me stumped. (I haven't tried my hand at (d) yet.) For ease I've just been working with a square (with edges identified). I took an open set (wlog, an open ball) in the square, but it's not clear what will happen if the image of $f$ doesn't hit this ball. It seems like we want to somehow get that the image \"wraps\" back onto itself, which would imply that $a$ is rational, but... I don't see how to get there. Any help is appreciated!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I think you want to show directly that the image does hit any ball. For any ball with center $(x,y)$ in the unit-square-with-edges-identified, translate the ball down along the direction $(1,a)$ such that its center sits at, say, the vertical edge of the square, with center $(x,y)-x(1,a)=(0,y-ax)$. If the translated ball is hit, the original ball will be hit $x$ time later. Thus, it is enough to show that every ball centered on the vertical edge is hit. What can you say about the intersection of the image and the vertical edge?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user is asking about part (c), which is to prove that the image of the map f(t) = (e^{2πit}, e^{2πi a t}) is dense in the torus T², given that a is irrational. They mentioned they've already done parts (a) and (b), so focusing on (c).\n\nFirst, I recall that when dealing with tori and such maps, density often relates to the idea that the trajectory doesn't repeat periodically, which makes sense since a is irrational. In the case of a torus, which can be thought of as [0,1)² with opposite edges identified, the image of f(t) is like a line with slope a. If a is irrational, this line never closes up, hence it should be dense.\n\nBut how to formalize this? The user mentioned using an open ball in the square and wanting to show that the image intersects every such ball. Maybe they can use the pigeonhole principle or some approximation argument. Another approach is to use the fact that the subgroup generated by (1, a) in the torus is dense when a is irrational. This is similar to how the irrational rotation on the circle is dense.\n\nWait, in the circle case, if you rotate by an irrational multiple of 2π, every orbit is dense. Maybe this is a higher-dimensional analog. The map f(t) can be seen as a one-parameter subgroup of the torus T², which is a compact abelian group. For such groups, the closure of a one-parameter subgroup is a Lie subgroup, and if the slope a is irrational, the subgroup can't be a closed 1-dimensional submanifold, hence it must be dense.\n\nBut maybe that's too advanced. The user might need a more elementary approach. Let me think. If we can show that for any open set U in T², there exists some t such that f(t) is in U. So given an open ball in T², which corresponds to a small rectangle in the covering space ℝ², we need to find t such that (t mod 1, a t mod 1) is within ε of some point (x, y) in the square.\n\nThis is similar to showing that the sequence { (t mod 1, a t mod 1) | t ∈ ℝ } is dense. Since a is irrational, the numbers 1 and a are rationally independent. By Kronecker's theorem, the set { (n mod 1, a n mod 1) | n ∈ ℤ } is dense in the torus. But here t is a real parameter, not just integers. However, even with real t, the density should hold. Wait, actually, since t can be any real number, we can adjust t continuously, which should allow us to approximate any point in the torus.\n\nAlternatively, consider projecting to each coordinate. The first coordinate is e^{2πit}, which wraps around the circle as t increases. The second coordinate is e^{2πi a t}, which wraps around the other circle with frequency a. Since a is irrational, the two frequencies are incommensurate, leading to the trajectory being dense.\n\nBut how to write this rigorously? Maybe using the fact that the image is a subgroup, so its closure is a closed subgroup. If the closure is not the whole torus, then it must be a closed proper subgroup, which in the case of the torus would have to be a finite union of closed connected subgroups. But since the image is a one-parameter subgroup, its closure is connected. The only connected closed subgroups of T² are either the whole torus, a circle, or a point. Since a is irrational, it can't be a circle (because that would imply a rational relation), so the closure must be the whole torus. Hence, the image is dense.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to use the fact that for any ε > 0 and any point (x, y) in T², there exists t such that |t - x| < ε mod 1 and |a t - y| < ε mod 1. This is similar to simultaneous Diophantine approximation. Since a is irrational, the multiples a t mod 1 are dense in [0,1), so for any y, we can make a t close to y. But we also need to adjust t so that t is close to x. Because a is irrational, the two conditions can be satisfied simultaneously.\n\nBut maybe a more straightforward way is to use the fact that the image of f is a subgroup, and then apply the theorem that a non-closed subgroup of the torus must be dense. Wait, but is the image a subgroup? Well, the torus is an abelian group, and f(t + s) = f(t) * f(s) component-wise, so f is a group homomorphism from (ℝ, +) to T². The image is a subgroup. The closure of a subgroup is also a subgroup. If the image is not closed, then its closure must be a closed subgroup. The closed connected subgroups of T² are either the entire torus or a circle. If the image is not the entire torus, then the closure would be a circle. But a circle subgroup would correspond to a rational direction, but a is irrational, which would lead to a contradiction. Hence, the closure must be the entire torus, so the image is dense.\n\nAlternatively, using the concept of minimal dynamical systems. The flow on the torus with irrational slope is minimal, meaning every orbit is dense. But that might be invoking more advanced dynamical systems concepts.\n\nIn any case, the key points are that a is irrational, leading to the image not being periodic, and hence dense. The user might need to reference Kronecker's theorem or the density of irrational flows on the torus. But since the user is working with an open ball in the square, they might need to show that for any (x, y) and ε, there's a t such that |t - x mod 1| < ε and |a t - y mod 1| < ε. This can be approached by considering the fractional parts of a t and t, and using the density of {n a mod 1} in [0,1) due to a being irrational.\n\nSo, breaking it down:\n\n1. Recognize that the problem is equivalent to showing the line (t, a t) mod 1 is dense in [0,1)² when a is irrational.\n\n2. Use the fact that for any x, y in [0,1), and ε > 0, there exists t such that |t - x| < ε mod 1 and |a t - y| < ε mod 1.\n\n3. This can be shown using the pigeonhole principle or by considering that the sequence { (n mod 1, a n mod 1) | n ∈ ℕ } is dense, which is Kronecker's theorem.\n\n4. Hence, the image is dense.\n\nBut wait, the problem states f(ℝ), not just integer multiples. So t can be any real number, not just integers. However, density in the integer case implies density in the real case because the real line is \"denser\" than integers. If you can approximate with integers, you can do even better with real numbers. Alternatively, since ℝ is a divisible group, the image under the homomorphism f would have dense image.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the map from ℝ to T² given by t ↦ (e^{2πit}, e^{2πi a t}) is a continuous homomorphism. The image is a one-parameter subgroup. The closure of the image is a closed connected subgroup of T². The closed connected subgroups of T² are either T² itself or a circle. If it's a circle, then the slope would have to be rational, which contradicts a being irrational. Therefore, the closure must be T², so the image is dense.\n\nThis seems like a solid approach. The key assumptions are that a is irrational, and that the torus is a compact abelian group where closed connected subgroups are well-understood.",
