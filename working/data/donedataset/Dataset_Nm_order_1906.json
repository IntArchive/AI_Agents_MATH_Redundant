    "Content": "How do I prove that a closed set $F$ in the metric $(X,d)$ is $G_\\delta$. Let $n\\in \\mathbb{N}$. I consider $B_n={F}=\\bigcup_ {x\\in F} B(x,{1\\over n})$, which is a collection of an open ball. Then I guess what I have to show next is the intersection of all these open balls is the closed set F. I'm not sure how to do that, please help me. Thank you so much.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If $\\displaystyle{x\\in\\bigcap_{n=1}^{\\infty}B_n}$ , then for each $n$ , by the definition of $B_n$ , there is some $x_n\\in F$ with $d(x_n,x)<1/n$ .  Then $(x_n)$ converges to $x$ , so as $F$ is closed $x\\in F$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original problem is about proving that a closed set in a metric space is a Gδ set. Let me start by understanding the problem thoroughly.\n\nFirst, the user mentioned a closed set F in a metric space (X, d). The goal is to prove F is a Gδ set, which means it's a countable intersection of open sets. The user's attempt involves defining B_n as the union of open balls of radius 1/n around each point in F, then trying to show the intersection of all B_n is F.\n\nNow, I need to list the assumptions. The problem is in a metric space, so the key assumptions here are that F is closed in X, and X is a metric space with metric d. The user also mentions n is a natural number, which is part of the construction of B_n. However, the original problem statement doesn't specify any other conditions, like F being compact or X being complete. So the main assumptions are:\n\n1. (X, d) is a metric space.\n2. F is a closed subset of X.\n3. For each natural number n, B_n is defined as the union of open balls of radius 1/n centered at each point of F.\n\nWait, but does the problem state that B_n is defined that way, or is that part of the user's attempt? The original question says, \"I consider B_n = {F} = ⋃_{x∈F} B(x, 1/n)\", which seems like the user's construction. The actual problem statement is to prove that a closed set F is Gδ. So the assumptions should be based on the problem, not the user's attempt.\n\nTherefore, the problem's assumptions are:\n\n1. (X, d) is a metric space.\n2. F is a closed subset of X.\n\nThe user's construction of B_n is part of their attempt, not the problem's given conditions. The problem itself doesn't mention B_n; the user is trying to use that approach. So in the formatted problem, the assumptions should include that F is closed in the metric space X. Then the problem is to prove F is a Gδ set, i.e., expressible as a countable intersection of open sets.\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is a single property applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\n(X, d) is a metric space,\nF is a closed subset of X.\n\nProblem:\nProve that F is a Gδ set in (X, d).\n\nBut the user mentioned considering B_n as the union of open balls, and then trying to show their intersection is F. But in the problem statement, that's part of the user's approach, not the original problem's assumptions. So the formatted problem shouldn't include B_n in the assumptions unless it's given as part of the problem. Since the original question is just \"prove a closed set F in the metric space (X,d) is Gδ\", the assumptions are just the metric space and F being closed.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatting is:\n\nAssumption:\n(X, d) is a metric space,\nF is a closed subset of X.\n\nProblem:\nProve that F is a Gδ set.\n\nI think that's it. The user's construction with B_n is their attempt, which might be correct or not, but the actual problem doesn't require those details in the assumptions. The key is to structure the original problem, filtering out the user's attempt and focusing on the given conditions.",
