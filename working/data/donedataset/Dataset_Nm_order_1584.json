    "Content": "Suppose you are given the polynomial \\begin{equation}\nf(x)=1+x^3\n\\end{equation} and the definition of Fourier transform:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\hat{f}(k)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}e^{-ikx}f(x)dx, k\\in \\mathbb{R}\n\\end{equation}\nObviously, that function has no Fourier transform but its correspoding tempered distribution does. So, in order to find that Fourier transform we do the following: \\begin{equation}\n\\langle \\hat{f}, \\phi \\rangle =\\langle f, \\hat{\\phi}\\rangle=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}f(x)\\hat{\\phi}(x)dx=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}(1+x^3)\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}e^{-ixy}\\phi(y)dydx \\Leftrightarrow \\\\\n\\langle \\hat{f}, \\phi \\rangle =\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}e^{-ixy}\\phi(y)dydx+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}x^3\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}e^{-ixy}\\phi(y)dydx\n\\end{equation}\nNow we argue that the inner integral is uniformly convergent to the variable $x$ and therefore by Fubini's theorem we can change the integration order. Moreover, there improper integrals do exist and so do their correspoding Principal Values. So:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\langle \\hat{f}, \\phi \\rangle =\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\lim_{R\\to \\infty}\\left[ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\phi(y)\\int_{-R}^{R}e^{-ixy}dxdy+\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\phi(y)\\int_{-R}^{R}x^3e^{-ixy}dxdy \\right]\n\\end{equation}\nThe first of these two integrals, I can see that is the $\\delta(x)$ with a coefficient. Mathematica says that the second one:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\lim_{R\\to \\infty}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\phi(y)\\int_{-R}^{R}x^3e^{-ixy}dxdy\n\\end{equation}\nis the $\\delta'''(x)$ (again with a coefficient but that is easy to take care of.) My question is how to prove that the second integral is the 3rd \"derivative\" of the Delta distribution. Thank you!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Well, derivation under the integral sign gives you directly\n$$\\delta(y)=\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int e^{-ixy}dx$$\n$$\\delta'(y)=\\frac{-i}{2\\pi}\\int xe^{-ixy}dx$$\n$$\\delta''(y)=\\frac{-1}{2\\pi}\\int x^2 e^{-ixy}dx$$\n$$\\delta'''(y)=\\frac{i}{2\\pi}\\int x^3 e^{-ixy}dx$$\nThen, by integration by parts, you can verify what it does as a distribution:\n$$\\int \\delta(y)f(y)dy=f(0)$$\n$$\\int \\delta'(y)f(y)dy=\\underbrace{\\delta(y)f(y)|_{-\\infty}^\\infty}_0-\\int \\delta(y)f'(y)dy=-f'(0)$$\n$$\\int \\delta''(y)f(y)dy=f''(0)$$\nand so on. Now you can start with a finite range where the by-parts won't be zero, and you will get the conditions for \"convergence\". $$\\int_{-A}^A \\delta'(y)f(y)dy=-i\\int_{-A}^A \\int_{-R}^R x e^{-ixy}f(y)dx\\,dy=$$\n$$=-i\\int_{-R}^R e^{-ixy}f(y)|_{-A}^A \\, dx+i\\int_{-A}^A \\int_{-R}^R e^{-ixy}f'(y)dx\\,dy$$\n$$=-2i \\sin AR \\frac{f(A)-f(-A)}{A}+i\\int_{-A}^A \\int_{-R}^R e^{-ixy}f'(y)dx\\,dy$$\nIn the limit, the second integral goes back to the delta function definition, while the first part is supposed to go to $0$ for a well behaved $f(y)$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this problem. The user is asking about the Fourier transform of the polynomial f(x) = 1 + x³ as a tempered distribution. They went through the steps of using the definition of the Fourier transform for distributions, swapping the order of integration using Fubini's theorem, and then splitting the integral into two parts. The first part they recognize as related to the delta distribution. The second part involves the integral of x³ times the exponential, which Mathematica says is the third derivative of the delta distribution. The user wants to prove that this second integral corresponds to the third derivative of the delta function.\n\nFirst, I need to structure this problem into the required format. The assumptions would be the conditions given in the problem. Let's see:\n\nThe original problem states that f(x) is a polynomial, specifically 1 + x³. The Fourier transform is defined in the tempered distribution sense. The user mentions that the function itself doesn't have a Fourier transform in the classical sense but does as a tempered distribution. So assumptions here would include that f is a tempered distribution, the definition of the Fourier transform for distributions, and the use of Fubini's theorem to swap integrals.\n\nBut the problem is about proving that the integral involving x³ e^{-ixy} dx, when considered in the distributional sense, leads to the third derivative of the delta distribution. The key steps here involve recognizing that multiplying by x³ corresponds to taking derivatives in the Fourier domain. In distribution theory, the Fourier transform of x^n f(x) is related to the nth derivative of the Fourier transform of f(x). Since the Fourier transform of 1 is the delta function, multiplying by x³ would involve the third derivative of delta.\n\nSo the assumptions should list each condition applied to specific objects. Let's break it down:\n\n1. f(x) = 1 + x³ is a tempered distribution.\n2. The Fourier transform of a tempered distribution f is defined by ⟨F̂, φ⟩ = ⟨f, Fφ⟩ for any Schwartz function φ.\n3. Fubini's theorem is applicable to swap the order of integration.\n4. The integral involving 1 contributes the delta distribution.\n5. The integral involving x³ e^{-ixy} relates to the third derivative of the delta distribution.\n\nWait, but the problem is specifically about the second integral (the one with x³) being the third derivative of delta. The user already knows the first integral gives delta, and they're asking to prove the second one gives delta'''. So the assumptions should include the properties of Fourier transforms of polynomials as derivatives of delta, and the action of multiplying by x^n in the context of distributions.\n\nSo structured:\n\nAssumptions:\n- f(x) = 1 + x^3 is treated as a tempered distribution.\n- The Fourier transform of a tempered distribution f is defined by ⟨F̂, φ⟩ = ⟨f, Fφ⟩ for all Schwartz functions φ.\n- Fubini's theorem allows swapping the order of integration for the integrals involved.\n- The Fourier transform of 1 (as a tempered distribution) is the Dirac delta distribution scaled appropriately.\n- The Fourier transform of x^n times a function corresponds to the nth derivative of the Fourier transform of the function, up to a factor of i^n.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the distributional Fourier transform of x^3 is the third derivative of the Dirac delta distribution, scaled appropriately.\n\nBut the original problem's exact wording is about showing the second integral (the one with x³) corresponds to the third derivative of delta. So maybe the problem statement should be more precise.\n\nOriginal user's problem: How to prove that the second integral (the one with x³) is the third derivative of the delta distribution.\n\nSo in the formatted problem, the assumptions should capture the necessary conditions and properties used in the process. Let me list them line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object.\n\nAssumptions:\n- f(x) = 1 + x^3 is a tempered distribution.\n- The Fourier transform of a tempered distribution f is defined via duality: ⟨F̂, φ⟩ = ⟨f, Fφ⟩ for all Schwartz functions φ.\n- Fubini's theorem is applicable to interchange the order of integration in the double integrals.\n- The Fourier transform of the constant function 1 is the Dirac delta distribution multiplied by √(2π).\n- Multiplying a distribution by x^3 corresponds to taking the third derivative of its Fourier transform, scaled by (-i)^3.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the distributional Fourier transform of x^3 results in the third derivative of the Dirac delta distribution multiplied by a coefficient.\n\nBut the user's exact question is about the second integral in their calculation, which is the Fourier transform of x^3. So the problem statement should reflect that. The original problem's process involves splitting the integral into two parts: one for 1 and one for x^3. The user needs to show that the x^3 part gives delta'''.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have assumptions related to the Fourier transform of x^3 as a tempered distribution, the application of Fubini, and the relation to derivatives of delta. The problem is to prove that the Fourier transform of x^3 (in the distributional sense) is proportional to delta'''.",
