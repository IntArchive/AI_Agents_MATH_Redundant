    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure, separating assumptions and the problem statement. First, I need to parse the original question carefully.\n\nThe original problem is about proving the inequality tan(sin x) > sin(tan x) for 0 < x < π/2. The user provided a link to a PDF with a method they consider ugly and shared their own solution involving derivatives and case analysis. They also mention an expansion around x approaching 0, showing the leading term is (1/30)x^7. The goal is to restructure this into the Assumption and Problem sections as per the example.\n\nFirst, identify the assumptions. The problem states 0 < x < π/2. The user's solution splits into two cases: 0 < x < arctan(π/2) and arctan(π/2) ≤ x < π/2. However, the key assumptions given in the problem are the interval for x. The rest are part of the solution attempt, which shouldn't be included in assumptions. So the main assumption is the interval of x.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement itself already specifies the interval. In the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, even though the original problem only mentioned \"for every integer n\". Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that's strange. Let me check the example again.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n)...\" is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem under assumptions lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so n is any integer, not necessarily divisible by 7. But the formatted problem adds that assumption. That might be a mistake in the example. Or maybe the example was altered. Wait, maybe I misread.\n\nWait, original example problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n(3^n + 2^n) is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem has assumptions: \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the divisibility by 7 isn't an assumption but part of the problem's conclusion. That suggests that the example might have an error. But according to the user's instruction, perhaps they made a mistake in the example. Alternatively, maybe in the original problem, there was a missing condition, but the user's example added it. Hmm, confusing. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instruction, which says to list all assumptions of the problem as per the original problem. Wait, but in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". So that seems like the user made a mistake in the example. Maybe the original problem was different? Or perhaps I need to be cautious here.\n\nBut perhaps the user's example is correct, and the original problem actually had n divisible by 7 as a condition. Wait, but the example's original problem says \"for every integer n\", which would mean that n can be any integer. So perhaps the formatted problem in the example is wrong. But the user is instructing me to follow their format, so maybe they made a typo. But regardless, I need to proceed with the current problem.\n\nBack to the current problem. The problem is to prove tan(sin x) > sin(tan x) for 0 < x < π/2. The original problem statement includes the interval 0 < x < π/2. So the assumption is that x is in that interval. However, in the example, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption and added \"n is divisible by 7\", which was not in the original. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. Alternatively, maybe the original example had a different problem where n needed to be divisible by 7. But given that, perhaps the user's instruction is to extract all assumptions from the problem as stated, even if they are part of the problem statement. So in the current problem, the assumption is that x is between 0 and π/2.\n\nTherefore, in this case, the assumption is that x is in (0, π/2). The problem is to prove the inequality. The rest of the content in the original question (like the PDF link, the user's solution steps, the mention of the series expansion) are irrelevant to structuring the problem into assumptions and problem statement. So we need to filter those out.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n0 < x < π/2\n\nProblem:\nProve that tan(sin x) > sin(tan x) for 0 < x < π/2.\n\nWait, but in the example, they included assumptions line by line, each for one object. Here, x is the only object, and the assumption is its interval. So that's one line. Therefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption: \n0 < x < π/2\n\nProblem:\nProve that tan(sin x) > sin(tan x).\n\nBecause the problem statement already includes the interval in the inequality. But the original problem states \"How prove this inequality tan{(\\sin{x})} > \\sin{(\\tan{x})}, 0<x<\\dfrac{\\pi}{2}\". So the interval is part of the problem statement. Therefore, the assumption is x is in that interval. So the problem is to prove the inequality under that assumption.\n\nYes, that's correct. Therefore, the formatted problem should list the assumption of the domain of x, and the problem is to prove the inequality. The user's own solution steps, the PDF link, etc., are extraneous and should be filtered out.\n\nAnother check: The original problem mentions \"0 < x < π/2\", which is the domain, so that's the key assumption. There are no other explicit conditions given. The problem is to prove the inequality holds in that interval. So the assumption is the interval of x, and the problem is the inequality.",
