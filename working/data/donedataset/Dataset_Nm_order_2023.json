    "Content": "How can I prove that the double negation elimination is not provable in constructive logic? To clarify, double negation elimination is the following statement: $$\\neg\\neg q \\rightarrow q$$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "There are two ways to go about this: Proof theory. We analyse the formal proofs in the inference system given, and show that there can be no formal proof of double negation elimination. This is difficult and depends a lot on the details of the inference system. Model theory. We construct a model of intuitionistic propositional logic in which double negation elimination is visibly false. This is much easier and less sensitive to details, but is conceptually more challenging. First of all, what is a model of intuitionistic propositional logic? It is an algebraic structure $\\mathfrak{A}$ equipped with constants $\\top$ and $\\bot$ as well as binary operations $\\land$, $\\lor$, $\\to$, plus a partial order $\\le$, such that the following soundness rule is valid: given formulae $\\phi$ and $\\psi$ in the language of intuitionistic propositional logic with propositional variables $x, y, z, \\ldots$, if the sequent $\\phi \\vdash \\psi$ is provable, then $\\phi \\le \\psi$ in $\\mathfrak{A}$ for all choices of $x, y, z, \\ldots$ in $\\mathfrak{A}$. For example, $\\mathfrak{A}$ could be a Heyting algebra , which is a algebraic structure satisfying some axioms. First of all $\\mathfrak{A}$ is a (bounded) lattice: Unit laws:\n\\begin{align}\n\\top \\land x & = x &\n\\bot \\lor x & = x \\\\\nx \\land \\top & = x & \nx \\lor \\bot & = x\n\\end{align} Associativity, commutativity, and idempotence:\n\\begin{align}\n(x \\land y) \\land z & = x \\land (y \\land z) &\n(x \\lor y) \\lor z & = x \\lor (y \\lor z) \\\\\nx \\land y & = y \\land x &\nx \\lor y & = y \\lor x \\\\\nx \\land x & = x &\nx \\lor x & = x \\\\\n\\end{align} Absorption law:\n\\begin{align}\nx \\land (x \\lor y) & = x &\nx \\lor (x \\land y) & = x\n\\end{align} One can then verify that $x \\le y$ defined by $x \\land y = x$ is a partial order on $\\mathfrak{A}$ and that $\\top$, $\\bot$, $\\land$, $\\lor$ have their usual order-theoretic meanings. We then add some axioms for $\\to$: Distributive law:\n$$x \\to (y \\land z) = (x \\to y) \\land (x \\to z)$$ Internal tautology:\n$$x \\to \\top = \\top$$ Internal weakening:\n$$y \\to (x \\land y) = y$$ Internal modus ponens:\n$$x \\land (x \\to y) = x \\land y$$ Exercise. Show that $y \\le z$ implies $(x \\to y) \\le (x \\to z)$, and $x \\le ((x \\land y) \\to y)$ and $((x \\to y) \\land y) \\le x$, and hence or otherwise that $x \\land y \\le z$ if and only if $x \\le (y \\to z)$. Exercise. Verify the soundness rule for interpreting intuitionistic propositional logic in a Heyting algebra. Proposition. Double negation elimination is not valid in intuitionistic propositional logic. Proof. We construct a three-element Heyting algebra to falsify double negation elimination. Let $\\mathfrak{A} = \\{ \\bot, \\omega, \\top \\}$ and define the binary operations as below:\n\\begin{align}\n\\begin{array}{|r|ccc|}\n\\hline\n\\land & \\bot & \\omega & \\top \\\\\n\\hline\n\\bot & \\bot & \\bot & \\bot \\\\\n\\omega & \\bot & \\omega & \\omega \\\\\n\\top & \\bot & \\omega & \\top \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array} &&\n\\begin{array}{|r|ccc|}\n\\hline\n\\lor & \\bot & \\omega & \\top \\\\\n\\hline\n\\bot & \\bot & \\omega & \\top \\\\\n\\omega & \\omega & \\omega & \\top \\\\\n\\top & \\top & \\top & \\top \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array} &&\n\\begin{array}{|r|ccc|}\n\\hline\n\\to & \\bot & \\omega & \\top \\\\\n\\hline\n\\bot & \\top & \\top & \\top \\\\\n\\omega & \\bot & \\top & \\top \\\\\n\\top & \\bot & \\omega & \\top \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\end{align}\nThen, observe that $((\\omega \\to \\bot) \\to \\bot) = \\top$, but $\\top \\nleq \\omega$. Therefore $(x \\to \\bot) \\to \\bot$ cannot be an axiom of intuitionistic propositional logic. Remark. De Morgan's laws remain valid in this Heyting algebra. Find one which falsifies part of De Morgan's laws. (See this question .)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure a question from Math Stack Exchange into their specified format. The example they provided shows that the Assumptions should list each condition applied to one object, line by line. Then the Problem is restated clearly.\n\nLooking at the original problem from the user: the title is \"Double negation elimination in constructive logic\" and the question is asking how to prove that double negation elimination (¬¬q → q) is not provable in constructive logic. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The example given had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Each assumption is a single property of one object. In the current problem, the main subject is constructive logic and the statement ¬¬q → q.\n\nBut what are the assumptions here? The problem is about proving that a certain statement (double negation elimination) isn't provable in constructive logic. So, perhaps the assumptions relate to the rules of constructive logic. However, in constructive logic, certain classical rules like the law of excluded middle aren't valid. But the user's example extracted explicit conditions from the problem statement. Here, the problem is to show that ¬¬q → q can't be proven in constructive logic. \n\nWait, maybe the assumptions here are about the logic system itself. But since the problem is about the unprovability within constructive logic, perhaps the assumptions are the framework of constructive logic. However, the example given in the user's prompt included specific conditions on the variable (n is integer, n divisible by 7). In this case, the question is more about the system's rules rather than variable conditions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no explicit assumptions other than working within constructive logic. But the problem is to prove that the elimination isn't provable. So perhaps the assumptions would be the context: that we are working within constructive logic, which does not include certain axioms. But the user's example seems to list the variables' conditions. Here, the variable is q, but the problem is about the general statement. Hmm.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"double negation elimination is not provable in constructive logic\". So the assumptions are that we are working within constructive logic, which has its own set of axioms and rules, excluding double negation elimination. But how to phrase that as per the user's example?\n\nWait, in the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. But in the problem here, perhaps the main assumption is that the logic is constructive. But the user's format requires each assumption to be a single line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has no explicit assumptions except the framework of constructive logic. But perhaps the user wants me to extract any implicit assumptions. The problem is to show that ¬¬q → q isn't provable. To do this, one might assume that constructive logic is consistent, but that might be a meta-assumption. But in the example given, the assumptions were explicit in the problem. The original problem there had A(n) defined for every integer n, but the formatted version added that n is divisible by 7 as an assumption, which wasn't in the original. Wait, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, the assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like the user made a mistake. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That might be incorrect. Wait, maybe the user provided an incorrect example. Wait, looking back: the original problem was to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. Then the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that seems contradictory. Unless the original problem had a typo and actually required n to be divisible by 7, but the user's example might have a mistake. Wait, perhaps in the example, the user wanted to restructure the problem but added an incorrect assumption. Because if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", then the assumption that n is divisible by 7 is an extra condition. So maybe the example is wrong. But regardless, the user is instructing me to follow their format, which includes listing assumptions, each as one line, each applied to one object.\n\nIn the current problem, the question is about proving that double negation elimination is not provable in constructive logic. So the assumptions here would be the rules of constructive logic. But how to phrase that as individual assumptions. Maybe:\n\nAssumption: Logic is constructive,\nAssumption: Double negation elimination is not an axiom.\n\nBut perhaps more precise. Alternatively, maybe the problem doesn't have explicit assumptions and the only assumption is the context of constructive logic. However, the user's example might have added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. For example, in their example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That suggests that the user may have modified the problem. Wait, maybe they made a mistake in the example.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the example, the problem had n as an integer, and then the formatted assumption listed \"n is an integer\". But the original problem already stated \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is redundant. Maybe the user intended to parse the problem and extract the conditions. Wait, maybe the original example was different. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem in example: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but 91 is 7*13. So if the problem is to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, they added that n is divisible by 7. That would mean the original problem had a mistake, and the formatted one corrects it. But perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. Anyway, the user is instructing me to follow their format, which in the example includes listing assumptions, even if they are redundant.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question is: How can I prove that the double negation elimination is not provable in constructive logic? Clarifying that double negation elimination is ¬¬q → q.\n\nSo, to structure this into the given format, the problem is to prove that ¬¬q → q is not provable in constructive logic. The assumptions here would be the framework of constructive logic. However, the example suggests that the assumptions are conditions on the variables or objects involved.\n\nBut in this case, the object is the logic system itself. However, the user's format says each assumption addresses only one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption: The logic system is constructive,\nAssumption: Double negation elimination is not an axiom.\n\nBut maybe more precise. Alternatively, the problem might not have explicit assumptions beyond the context. However, in constructive logic, certain principles are not allowed, so the assumption is that we are working within constructive logic, which lacks the law of excluded middle and double negation elimination.\n\nBut perhaps the key assumption is that the logic is constructive, which disallows certain classical principles. However, how to split that into line items. Alternatively, maybe the problem has no explicit assumptions, but the user's format requires listing them. Alternatively, maybe the problem's assumption is that we are using constructive logic, which is one assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no assumptions beyond the system, so the problem is as stated. The example might have had incorrect assumptions added, but perhaps in this case, the problem is just to state the problem with no additional assumptions.\n\nBut the user's example added assumptions even when the original problem didn't specify. For example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which includes all integers, but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect unless the original problem had a typo.\n\nBut given that the user's example is structured that way, maybe they expect me to extract any conditions from the problem. In the current problem, the only condition is that the logic is constructive. So perhaps the assumption is:\n\nAssumption: The logic is constructive.\n\nProblem: Prove that ¬¬q → q is not provable.\n\nBut the user's example split the assumptions into two lines. If there's only one assumption here, then just one line.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the context of intuitionistic logic, which is constructive. So the assumption is that we are working in intuitionistic logic, which is constructive.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: The logic is constructive (intuitionistic),\nProblem: Prove that ¬¬q → q is not provable.\n\nBut the user's example had two assumptions. Maybe there's another assumption here. Let me think. The problem is about double negation elimination. In constructive logic, double negation introduction is provable (i.e., q implies ¬¬q), but elimination is not. So perhaps another assumption is that the logic does not include double negation elimination as an axiom.\n\nBut that might be redundant, as that's part of being constructive. Alternatively, maybe the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption: The logic is constructive,\nAssumption: Double negation elimination is not an axiom.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe there's only one assumption: The logic is constructive.\n\nGiven the user's example, perhaps in their format, even if the problem states \"for every integer n\", the assumption is listed as \"n is an integer\". So in this case, the assumption would be \"q is a proposition\" or something. But in the problem statement, q is a proposition variable. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption: q is a proposition.\n\nBut that's perhaps too trivial. Alternatively, maybe the problem doesn't require any specific assumptions beyond the system. However, the user's format requires assumptions, so I need to list them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has no explicit assumptions, but in constructive logic, certain proof methods are not allowed. So the assumption is that the logic is constructive. But how to phrase that as a single line.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem doesn't have any specific assumptions and the user's example was incorrect. But since I have to follow the user's instructions, I should proceed.\n\nBased on the example, even if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", the formatted version lists \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, even though it's part of the problem statement. So perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption: q is a proposition,\nAssumption: The logic is constructive.\n\nProblem: Prove that ¬¬q → q is not provable.\n\nBut the original question says \"in constructive logic\", so maybe the assumption is that the logic is constructive. But the example had \"n is an integer\" even though the problem stated \"for every integer n\". So following that pattern, the assumption here is \"the logic is constructive\", which is already part of the problem statement. Therefore:\n\nAssumption: The logic is constructive.\n\nProblem: Prove that ¬¬q → q is not provable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in the context of constructive logic, so the assumption is that we are working within constructive logic. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: The logic system is constructive.\n\nProblem: Prove that ¬¬q → q is not provable.\n\nBut I need to check if there are more assumptions. For example, in constructive logic, the law of excluded middle is not assumed. So maybe another assumption is:\n\nAssumption: The law of excluded middle is not assumed.\n\nBut I'm not sure. The user's example included specific mathematical assumptions. Here, the assumptions are more about the logical framework.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond the logical system, so the assumption is just \"The logic is constructive.\"\n\nThus, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: The logic is constructive.\n\nProblem: Prove that the statement ¬¬q → q is not provable.\n\nBut the original problem title is \"Double negation elimination in constructive logic\", and the question is about proving that it's not provable. So yes, the key assumption is the logic being constructive.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct formatted problem would have one assumption: the logic is constructive. Then the problem is to prove the statement is not provable.",
