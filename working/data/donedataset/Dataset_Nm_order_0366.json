    "Content": "I saw this tucked away in a MathOverflow comment and am asking this question to preserve (and advertise?) it. It's a nice problem! Problem: Suppose $A$ and $B$ are real $n\\times n$ matrices with $A^2+B^2=AB$. If $AB-BA$ is invertible, prove $n$ is a multiple of $3$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I. Let $k$ be a field and consider the algebra $\\def\\A{\\mathcal A}\\A_k=k\\langle a,b:a^2+b^2-ab\\rangle$. We have\n  $$ aaa = aab - abb = abb - bbb - abb = - bbb $$\nand \n  $$ aaa = aba - bba, $$\nso that\n  $$ aba = bba - bbb. $$\nLet $x=ab-ba$. Then \n\\begin{gather}\nax = aab-aba = abb - bbb - bba + bbb = abb - bba, \\\\\nbx = bab-bba, \\\\\nxa = aba - baa = bba - bbb - bab + bbb = bba - bab, \\\\\nxb = abb - bab, \\\\\n\\end{gather}\nso that in fact\n\\begin{gather}\nax = x(-a+b), \\\\\nbx = x(-a).\n\\end{gather}\nThere is an automorphism $\\sigma:\\A_k\\to\\A_k$ such that $\\sigma(a)=-a+b$ and $\\sigma(b)=-a$, and the two equations above immediately imply that \n$$ \\text{$ux = x\\sigma(u)$ for all $u\\in\\A_k$.}$$\nSince $\\sigma^3=\\mathrm{id}_{\\A_k}$, it follows that $x^3$ is central in $\\A_k$. If $V$ is a $\\A_k$-module, let us write $m_u:v\\in V\\mapsto uv\\in V$. II. Let $V$ be a simple finite dimensional left $\\def\\CC{\\mathbb C}\\A_\\CC$-module, and let us suppose that $m_x$ is invertible. The map $m_{x^3}$ is an endomorphism of $V$ as a module because $x^3$ is central in $A$, so Schur's lemma tells us that there exists a $\\lambda\\in\\CC$ such that $m_{x^3}=\\lambda\\cdot\\mathrm{id}_V$. Since $m_x$ is invertible, $\\lambda\\neq0$, and there exists a $\\mu\\in\\CC\\setminus0$ such that $\\mu^3=\\lambda$. Let $y=x/\\mu$, so that $m_y^3=m_{y^3}=\\mathrm{id}_V$. It follows that the eigenvalues of $m_{y}$ are cubic roots on unity. On the other hand, we have $m_y=[m_a,m_b]/\\mu$, so that $\\operatorname{tr}m_y=0$. Now, the only linear combinations with integer coefficients of the three cubic roots of unity which vanish are those in which the three roots have the same coefficient. Since $\\operatorname{tr} y$ is the sum of the eigenvalues of $m_y$ taken with multiplicity, we conclude that thee three roots of unity have the same multiplicity as eigenvalues of $m_y$. This is only posssible if $\\dim V$ is divisible by 3. III. More generally, let now $V$ be a finite dimensional $\\A_\\CC$-module such that the map $v\\in V\\mapsto xv\\in V$ is invertible. Since $V$ has finite dimension, it has finite length as an $\\A$-module, and it is an iterated extension of finitely many simple $\\A$-modules. Each of this modules has the property that $x$ acts bijectively on it, so we know their dimension is divisible by $3$. It follows then that the dimension of $V$ itself is divisible by $3$. IV. Let now $V$ be a finite dimensional $\\def\\RR{\\mathbb R}\\A_\\RR$-module on which $x$ acts bijectively. Then $\\CC\\otimes_\\RR V$ is a finite dimensional $\\CC\\otimes_\\RR\\A_\\RR$-module. Since $\\CC\\otimes_\\RR\\A_\\RR$ is obviously isomorphic to $\\A_\\CC$, we know $\\dim_\\CC\\CC\\otimes_\\RR V$ is divisible by three,  and then so is $\\dim_\\RR V$ because this is in fact equal to $\\dim_\\CC\\CC\\otimes_\\RR V$. This conclusion is precisely the one we sought. The conclusion reached in III is in fact stronger than the one in IV. All this looks weird, but it is very, very natural. A pair of matrices satisfying the relation $A^2+B^2=AB$ gives a representation of the algebra $\\A_k$. It is natural to try to obtain a basis for $\\A_k$, at the very least, and this is usually done using Bergman's diamond lemma. The first part of the computation done in I is the start of that. Next, we are not interested in all $\\A_k$ modules but only in those in which $X=[A,B]$ is invertible. This is the same as the modules which are actually modules over the localization of $\\A_k$ at $x=[a,b]$. Comuting in such a localization is a pain, unless the element at which we are localizing is normal: one thus it motivated to check for normality. It turns out that $x$ is normal; there is then an endomorphism of the algebra attached to it, which is $\\sigma$. One immediatelly recognized $\\sigma$ to be given by a matrix of order $3$. The rest is standard representation theory. In a way, this actually gives a method to solve this sort of problems. Kevin asked on MO: «Are there really books that can teach you how to solve such problems??» and the answer is yes: this is precisely what representation theory is about!",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example they provided shows breaking down the original problem into assumptions and the problem statement. So, I need to do the same for the problem from Math Stack Exchange about square matrices.\n\nFirst, the original problem states: Suppose A and B are real n×n matrices with A² + B² = AB. If AB - BA is invertible, prove n is a multiple of 3.\n\nI need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let's parse the problem.\n\n1. The first condition is that A and B are real matrices. So, \"A and B are real n×n matrices.\" But according to the example, each assumption should address one object. Wait, in the example, they had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" So maybe here, I should split \"A is a real n×n matrix\" and \"B is a real n×n matrix\" as separate assumptions. But the original problem says \"A and B are real n×n matrices,\" so perhaps combining them is okay, but the example splits even when multiple objects. Wait, the example's original problem was about n, a single variable, so maybe in this case, since there are two objects, A and B, each assumption should be about one. But the condition is that both are real n×n matrices. Hmm, maybe the user wants each assumption to be a single condition. So perhaps \"A and B are real n×n matrices\" is one assumption. Then the next condition is \"A² + B² = AB,\" which is another assumption. Then \"AB - BA is invertible\" is another assumption. So total three assumptions.\n\nBut the example had two assumptions for the problem where n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in the problem here, the first assumption is about A and B being matrices of size n×n, real. The second is the equation A² + B² = AB. The third is that AB - BA is invertible. Then the problem is to prove n is a multiple of 3.\n\nSo structuring that:\n\nAssumption:\nA and B are real n×n matrices,\nA² + B² = AB,\nAB - BA is invertible.\n\nProblem: Prove that n is a multiple of 3.\n\nWait, but in the example, they split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" into two separate assumptions. So maybe here, \"A and B are real n×n matrices\" can be split into two: \"A is a real n×n matrix\" and \"B is a real n×n matrix.\" However, the original problem statement mentions them together. The user's example splits properties even when applied to the same object. For instance, in the example, both assumptions are about n. So perhaps here, since A and B are both matrices, but the problem states them together, it's acceptable to keep them as one assumption. Alternatively, split into two. The example had two separate assumptions for the same object. Wait, n being an integer and n being divisible by 7 are two separate properties. Similarly, here, \"A and B are real n×n matrices\" is a single property about both A and B. But maybe the user wants each assumption to be about a single object. So perhaps \"A is a real n×n matrix,\" \"B is a real n×n matrix,\" \"A² + B² = AB,\" and \"AB - BA is invertible.\" Then four assumptions. But the example combined two properties about n into separate lines, even though they apply to the same object. So yes, each line is one property, even if same object. Therefore, here, \"A is a real n×n matrix,\" \"B is a real n×n matrix,\" \"A² + B² = AB,\" \"AB - BA is invertible.\" But the original problem says \"A and B are real n×n matrices,\" so perhaps it's better to split into two. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted assumption was \"n is an integer,\" then \"n is divisible by 7.\" So even though the original problem says \"for every integer n,\" the formatted version split into two lines. So perhaps here, the original problem's first sentence is \"A and B are real n×n matrices,\" which in the formatted version would become two assumptions: \"A is a real n×n matrix\" and \"B is a real n×n matrix.\" Then the next condition is \"A² + B² = AB\" as another assumption. Then \"AB - BA is invertible\" as another. So total four assumptions. That seems more in line with the example's approach. Because in the example, the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7, but the formatted problem added it as an assumption. Wait, no, the original problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem had assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that's different. Wait, the example seems to have a mistake. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" So maybe the user made a mistake in the example, or maybe they were filtering unrelated info. Wait, perhaps the original problem had additional constraints. Wait, the original problem in the example was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted problem's assumptions are \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" But that would mean that the problem is to prove A(n) divisible by 91 under the assumption that n is an integer divisible by 7. But the original problem says \"for every integer n,\" so maybe the user made a mistake in their example. Alternatively, perhaps the example was from a different problem. Hmm, this is confusing. Wait, the user's example shows the original problem as \"Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91,\" and the formatted problem lists assumptions \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" But this seems contradictory. Unless the original problem actually had an additional condition that n is divisible by 7, but the user's example might have a typo. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to split the problem into necessary assumptions. For instance, perhaps the problem requires that n is an integer and also that 91 divides the expression, which requires n to be divisible by 7. But I'm not sure. Given that, maybe the user wants each assumption to be a separate line, even if multiple conditions apply to the same object. So in the current problem, \"A and B are real n×n matrices\" would be split into two: \"A is a real n×n matrix\" and \"B is a real n×n matrix.\" Then \"A² + B² = AB\" as another assumption. Then \"AB - BA is invertible\" as another. So four assumptions. Then the problem is to prove n is a multiple of 3. That seems correct. Alternatively, if the original problem states \"A and B are real n×n matrices\" as one condition, but the example splits similar conditions, then maybe splitting is necessary. The example splits \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" even though both are about n. So perhaps in this problem, splitting \"A is a real n×n matrix\" and \"B is a real n×n matrix\" is the way to go. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a real n×n matrix,\nB is a real n×n matrix,\nA² + B² = AB,\nAB - BA is invertible.\n\nProblem: Prove that n is a multiple of 3.\n\nYes, that seems to fit the example's structure, where each assumption is a single condition applied to one object, even if multiple conditions apply to the same object. So each line is one property or condition for one object. Therefore, I'll structure it that way.",
