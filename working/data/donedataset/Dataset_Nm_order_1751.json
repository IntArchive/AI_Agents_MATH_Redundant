    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual mathematics professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object. Then, the problem statement follows.\n\nLooking at the original problem from Math Stack Exchange:\n\n**Title:** How to evaluate Ahmed's integral $\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{\\tan^{-1}\\sqrt{x^{2}+2}}{(x^{2}+1)\\sqrt{x^{2}+2}}\\mathop{\\mathrm{d}x}$\n\n**Question:** How to show that: $$\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{\\tan^{-1}\\sqrt{x^{2}+2}}{(x^{2}+1)\\sqrt{x^{2}+2}}\\mathop{\\mathrm{d}x}=\\frac{5\\pi ^{2}}{96}$$ I saw this on Wolfram.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The integral is from 0 to 1, and the integrand involves arctangent of sqrt(x² + 2) divided by (x² + 1) times sqrt(x² + 2). The goal is to prove the integral equals 5π²/96.\n\nAssumptions here are conditions or properties that are given or necessary for the problem. In the example, assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the integral is definite from 0 to 1. The integrand involves several functions: arctan, sqrt(x² + 2), and denominators with x² +1 and sqrt(x² +2). Are there any implicit assumptions here?\n\nWell, for the integral to be evaluated as stated, we might assume that the integrand is defined and integrable over [0,1]. Since the denominator has (x² +1) and sqrt(x² +2), which are always positive, and the numerator arctan is also defined for all real numbers, the integrand is smooth on [0,1]. So maybe the user expects assumptions about the limits or the domain? But in the example, the assumption was about n's properties. Here, the integral's variable is x from 0 to 1. Maybe no explicit assumptions beyond the integral being from 0 to 1. Wait, but in the example, they included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. However, in the problem here, the integral's limits are given as 0 to 1, so maybe the main assumption is that the integral is over the interval [0,1]. Since the problem is to evaluate the integral, the assumptions would be the integral bounds and that the integrand is as given. But perhaps the problem doesn't have additional assumptions beyond what's stated. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem included an assumption that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. Wait, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, maybe there was a mistake in the example? Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems like a mistake. So perhaps the user's example is incorrect, but we have to follow the instruction regardless.\n\nBut in the current problem, the integral is from 0 to 1, and the problem is to show it equals 5π²/96. Are there any assumptions here? The integrand is defined on [0,1], so perhaps the bounds are part of the problem, not the assumptions. Wait, the example included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. But in the original problem, it was stated as \"for every integer n\". So perhaps the user considers the given conditions as assumptions, even if they are part of the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, in the current problem, the integral's lower limit is 0 and upper limit is 1. So maybe the assumptions are that the integral is from 0 to 1. But that's part of the problem statement. Hmm. Wait, maybe the user wants to list the integral's bounds as assumptions? In the example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, with the assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But in the original problem, it was for every integer n. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. Therefore, maybe for the current problem, the assumption is just that the integral is from 0 to 1. But perhaps there are no additional assumptions here. The example may have included an incorrect assumption, but following the user's instruction, we need to list all assumptions. Wait, maybe in the problem, the user wants to break down the components. Let me see.\n\nOriginal problem: The integral from 0 to 1 of [arctan(sqrt(x²+2)) / ((x²+1)sqrt(x²+2))] dx equals 5π²/96.\n\nSo the problem is to evaluate this definite integral. The assumptions would be related to the integral's limits and the integrand's components. But since all these are given in the problem statement, maybe there are no separate assumptions beyond what's in the integral. However, in the example, the user included assumptions even if they were part of the problem statement. For instance, in the example, the problem says \"for every integer n\", which was translated into an assumption \"n is an integer\". Then, another assumption \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, that seems like an error in the example. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That's contradictory. Therefore, maybe the user made a mistake in the example. But regardless, I need to follow the format.\n\nBut given that, perhaps the user wants to extract all conditions from the problem and list them as assumptions. In the integral problem, the integral is from 0 to 1, and the integrand is as given. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- The lower limit of integration is 0.\n\n- The upper limit of integration is 1.\n\n- The integrand is [arctan(sqrt(x² + 2))]/[(x² +1)sqrt(x² +2)].\n\nBut each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe integral is with respect to x,\n\nThe lower limit of the integral is 0,\n\nThe upper limit of the integral is 1,\n\nThe integrand is $\\frac{\\tan^{-1}\\sqrt{x^{2}+2}}{(x^{2}+1)\\sqrt{x^{2}+2}}$,\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. However, in the example, the assumptions were about the variable n. Here, the integral's variable is x, but the problem is to compute the integral as given, so perhaps the main assumptions are the integral's bounds and the integrand's form. Alternatively, since the problem is just to evaluate the integral as stated, maybe there are no additional assumptions beyond what's in the problem statement. But according to the example, even if the problem states \"for every integer n\", the assumption is listed as \"n is an integer\". So similarly, for the integral problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The integral is taken over the interval [0, 1].\n\n- The integrand is as given.\n\nBut how to split into separate lines? Each line addresses one property or condition of one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe variable of integration is x,\n\nThe lower limit of integration is 0,\n\nThe upper limit of integration is 1,\n\nThe integrand is $\\frac{\\tan^{-1}\\sqrt{x^{2}+2}}{(x^{2}+1)\\sqrt{x^{2}+2}}$,\n\nBut maybe the user considers each part of the integrand as separate? For example:\n\n- The numerator of the integrand is $\\tan^{-1}\\sqrt{x^{2}+2}$,\n\n- The denominator of the integrand is $(x^{2}+1)\\sqrt{x^{2}+2}$,\n\nBut that might be overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the integrand is considered as one single assumption. In the example, the assumption was about the form of A(n). So here, similarly, the integrand's structure is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Wait, in the example, the problem statement included the expression for A(n), and the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7. But the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7. So that example seems to have added an extra assumption not present in the original problem, which is confusing. Therefore, perhaps the user made an error in the example, but the instruction is to structure the problem as per the format, listing assumptions from the problem.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps for the current problem, the only assumption is the integral is from 0 to 1. But the example suggests that even if the problem states \"for every integer n\", we list \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. Similarly, here, the integral is from 0 to 1, so the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe integral is from 0 to 1,\n\nThe integrand is $\\frac{\\tan^{-1}\\sqrt{x^{2}+2}}{(x^{2}+1)\\sqrt{x^{2}+2}}$,\n\nBut each assumption on one line. Alternatively, maybe split into parts. However, the example had two assumptions: n is integer, n divisible by 7, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So perhaps the user wants to list even the obvious assumptions. So in this case:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe integral is with respect to x,\n\nThe lower limit of integration is 0,\n\nThe upper limit of integration is 1,\n\nThe integrand involves the arctangent function,\n\nThe integrand includes $\\sqrt{x^2 + 2}$ in the numerator and denominator,\n\nThe denominator includes $(x^2 + 1)$.\n\nBut this seems too granular. However, the example in the user's instruction had two assumptions, even though the original problem only mentioned \"for every integer n\". The user's example added \"n is divisible by 7\" which wasn't in the original problem. This suggests that perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. Therefore, maybe the correct approach is to list only the assumptions explicitly given in the problem. Since the original problem here is to evaluate the integral as stated, with limits from 0 to 1 and the given integrand, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The integral is from 0 to 1.\n\n- The integrand is as specified.\n\nBut the example seems to have included an extra assumption not present in the original problem. Therefore, maybe the user wants to list all conditions mentioned in the problem as separate assumptions, even if they are part of the problem's statement. So for the integral problem:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe integral is definite,\n\nThe lower limit is 0,\n\nThe upper limit is 1,\n\nThe integrand is $\\frac{\\tan^{-1}\\sqrt{x^{2}+2}}{(x^{2}+1)\\sqrt{x^{2}+2}}$,\n\nBut again, each on separate lines. Alternatively, since the integrand is a single entity, perhaps it's one assumption. The example had the expression for A(n) as part of the problem, not the assumption. The assumptions were about n. So in this case, the integral's expression is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Therefore, the assumption would be the limits of integration. Wait, but the example didn't list the expression as an assumption. It listed assumptions about the variable n. Similarly, here, the variable is x, but the problem is to compute the integral, so perhaps there are no assumptions about x beyond its being the variable of integration, which is already clear. Therefore, perhaps the only assumption is that the integral is from 0 to 1. But the example's formatting is confusing because it added an extra assumption. Given that, perhaps the user wants to list the integral's bounds as assumptions. So:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe integral is evaluated from 0 to 1.\n\nProblem: Show that $$\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{\\tan^{-1}\\sqrt{x^{2}+2}}{(x^{2}+1)\\sqrt{x^{2}+2}}\\mathop{\\mathrm{d}x}=\\frac{5\\pi ^{2}}{96}.$$\n\nBut in the example, the problem was restated with the expression. So perhaps the problem part includes the integral expression, and the assumptions are the conditions on the variables involved. However, in this integral problem, the variable x is integrated over [0,1], so there's no variable parameter like n. Therefore, maybe there are no assumptions beyond the integral setup. But the example had added an assumption not present in the original problem. This is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's example is incorrect, and the correct way is to list only the assumptions that are given in the problem but not part of the main statement. For instance, if the problem says \"Prove that for every integer n...\", then the assumption is \"n is an integer\". Similarly, here, the problem states the integral from 0 to 1, so the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe integral is from 0 to 1.\n\nBut the example added an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) not present in the original problem. That might be a mistake. So, perhaps the correct way is to list only the assumptions that are part of the problem's hypothesis. In the Ahmed integral problem, the only assumption is that the integral is from 0 to 1. But since the problem is to evaluate it, there are no other assumptions. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe integral is evaluated over the interval [0, 1].\n\nProblem: Show that $$\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{\\tan^{-1}\\sqrt{x^{2}+2}}{(x^{2}+1)\\sqrt{x^{2}+2}}\\mathop{\\mathrm{d}x}=\\frac{5\\pi ^{2}}{96}.$$\n\nBut according to the user's example, even if the problem states \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So following that, the assumption here would be the integral's limits and variable. But maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe variable of integration is x,\n\nThe lower limit of integration is 0,\n\nThe upper limit of integration is 1,\n\nThe integrand is $\\frac{\\tan^{-1}\\sqrt{x^{2}+2}}{(x^{2}+1)\\sqrt{x^{2}+2}}$,\n\nBut the problem is to show the integral equals 5π²/96. However, in the user's example, the problem statement includes the expression for A(n). So maybe the integrand is part of the problem statement, not the assumptions. Therefore, the assumptions are the conditions on the variables and limits, while the problem is the equality to be proven.\n\nBut in the integral problem, the integrand is part of the problem's statement. So perhaps the assumptions are just the limits and variable. However, according to the user's example, they split the problem into assumptions and the problem statement. The example's original problem had A(n) defined, and the formatted problem listed assumptions about n, then restated the problem with A(n)'s expression.\n\nTherefore, for the current problem:\n\nAssumption:\n\nx is a real variable,\n\nThe integral is from 0 to 1,\n\nThe integrand is as given.\n\nProblem: Show that the integral equals 5π²/96.\n\nBut perhaps the user wants each assumption line by line:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe integral is with respect to x,\n\nThe lower limit of the integral is 0,\n\nThe upper limit of the integral is 1,\n\nThe integrand is $\\frac{\\tan^{-1}\\sqrt{x^{2}+2}}{(x^{2}+1)\\sqrt{x^{2}+2}}$,\n\nProblem: Prove that the integral equals $\\frac{5\\pi^2}{96}$.\n\nBut the example in the user's instruction shows that even the expression of A(n) is part of the problem statement, not the assumption. Therefore, in the current problem, the problem would include the integral expression, and the assumptions are the bounds. Wait, but in the example, the formatted problem still includes the expression A(n) in the problem statement. So maybe here, the problem statement is the integral expression equals 5π²/96, and the assumptions are the integral's limits and variable.\n\nTherefore, final formatting would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe integral is evaluated from 0 to 1,\n\nThe variable of integration is x.\n\nProblem: Show that  \n$$\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{\\tan^{-1}\\sqrt{x^{2}+2}}{(x^{2}+1)\\sqrt{x^{2}+2}}\\mathop{\\mathrm{d}x}=\\frac{5\\pi ^{2}}{96}.$$\n\nBut the example included multiple assumptions, each line for one property. So \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe integral is taken over the interval [0, 1],\n\nThe integrand involves $\\tan^{-1}\\sqrt{x^2 + 2}$,\n\nThe denominator of the integrand is $(x^2 + 1)\\sqrt{x^2 + 2}$,\n\nBut this seems excessive. Alternatively, just stating the integral's bounds.\n\nGiven the confusion from the user's example possibly containing an error, I think the safest approach is to list the integral's bounds as assumptions and the rest as part of the problem statement. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe lower limit of integration is 0,\n\nThe upper limit of integration is 1.\n\nProblem: Show that  \n$$\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{\\tan^{-1}\\sqrt{x^{2}+2}}{(x^{2}+1)\\sqrt{x^{2}+2}}\\mathop{\\mathrm{d}x}=\\frac{5\\pi ^{2}}{96}.$$\n\nThis way, each assumption is a single property (lower and upper limits) applied to the integral.",
