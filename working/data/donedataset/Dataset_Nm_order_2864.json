    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let's see. The definition of a Baire space is that a countable intersection of dense open sets is dense. So let $I$ be the space of irrational numbers, and let $U_1,U_2,U_3,\\dots$ be a sequence of dense open subsets of $I$; I have to show that $\\bigcap_{n=1}^\\infty U_n$ is dense. Now, \"$U$ is open in $I$\" means that $U=V\\cap I$ for some $V$ which is open in $\\mathbb R$; moreover, if $V\\cap I$ is dense in $I$, then (since $I$ is dense in $\\mathbb R$) it's dense in $\\mathbb R$, and so is $V$. So it's enough to show is that, if $V_1,V_2,\\dots$ is a sequence of dense open sets in $\\mathbb R$, then $\\bigcap_{n=1}^\\infty(V_n\\cap I)=(\\bigcap_{n=1}^\\infty V_n)\\cap I$ is dense. But $I$ itself is a countable intersection of dense open subsets of $\\mathbb R$, namely, $I=\\bigcap_{q\\in\\mathbb Q}(\\mathbb R\\setminus\\{q\\})$. So now I have to show that $(\\bigcap_{n=1}^\\infty V_n)\\cap\\bigcap_{q\\in\\mathbb Q}(\\mathbb R\\setminus\\{q\\})$ is dense, but that's a countable intersection of dense open subsets of $\\mathbb R$, so by the Baire category theorem . . .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example they provided shows that the assumptions should list each condition applied to one object, and then state the problem.\n\nThe original question is: \"How to show that the set of irrational numbers is a Baire space?\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall what a Baire space is. From topology, a Baire space is a space where the intersection of countably many dense open sets is dense. So, to prove that the irrational numbers form a Baire space, we need to verify this property.\n\nBut the problem might have some assumptions. Let me think. The set of irrational numbers is typically considered with the subspace topology inherited from the real numbers. So, perhaps the assumptions are related to the properties of the space they're in. Wait, the example given had assumptions like \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7.\" So maybe here, the assumptions would be about the space itself.\n\nWait, the irrational numbers are a topological space. So possible assumptions could be:\n\n1. The set of irrational numbers is considered with the subspace topology inherited from the real numbers.\n2. The real numbers with the standard topology are a Baire space.\n\nBut I need to check if the problem states any specific conditions or if there are implicit assumptions. The original question is straightforward, asking to show that the irrationals are a Baire space. The user probably expects that the irrationals are a completely metrizable space or something, but maybe the key assumption is that the real numbers are a Baire space, and the irrationals as a subspace inherit this property under certain conditions.\n\nWait, actually, the irrationals with the subspace topology are completely metrizable (they are homeomorphic to Baire space NN, which is completely metrizable), and completely metrizable spaces are Baire spaces by the Baire category theorem. But perhaps the problem expects using the fact that the irrationals are a G-delta set in a complete metric space, hence they are also a Baire space.\n\nBut the user wants assumptions. Let me think again. The example given had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in this problem, the question is about the set of irrational numbers. So possible assumptions could be:\n\n- The set of irrational numbers is equipped with the subspace topology induced by the real numbers.\n- The real numbers with the standard topology form a Baire space.\n\nBut wait, maybe there are more specific assumptions. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in a more general context. Let me check the exact wording. The original problem says: \"How to show that the set of irrational numbers is a Baire space?\"\n\nAssuming that the user is working within the context of standard real numbers, the key assumptions would be:\n\n1. The set of irrational numbers is a topological space with the subspace topology inherited from the real numbers.\n2. The real numbers with the standard topology form a Baire space.\n\nBut maybe there's another approach. Sometimes, to show a space is Baire, you can use the fact that open subsets of Baire spaces are Baire if they are dense and G-delta. The irrationals are a dense G-delta in the reals, which is a complete metric space (hence Baire). Therefore, the irrationals would inherit the Baire property.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects the user to prove it directly by showing that countable intersections of dense open sets are dense in the irrationals.\n\nBut the user wants the assumptions. So, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe real numbers are a Baire space,\nThe set of irrational numbers is a completely metrizable space,\nThe set of irrational numbers is a dense G-delta subset of the real numbers.\n\nWait, but in the example, each assumption is a single condition applied to one object. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe real numbers with the standard topology form a Baire space,\nThe set of irrational numbers is equipped with the subspace topology from the real numbers,\nThe set of irrational numbers is a completely metrizable space,\nThe set of irrational numbers is a dense subset of the real numbers.\n\nBut maybe some of these are redundant. For instance, being a completely metrizable space might be a consequence of other properties. Alternatively, perhaps the key assumptions are that the irrationals are a completely metrizable space (since they can be given a complete metric) and that they are a topological space. But I need to parse the problem as presented. The original problem doesn't mention any specific conditions, so the user might just need to structure the problem by listing the implicit assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has no additional assumptions beyond the standard ones. For example, the problem might assume that the reader knows that the irrationals are considered as a subspace of the real numbers. So the assumption would be that the set of irrational numbers is a topological space with the subspace topology. Then the problem is to show that this space is a Baire space.\n\nIn the example given, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer, even though the problem statement already says \"for every integer n\". But the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, no, looking back: the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. However, the formatted problem in the example listed assumptions as \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but that seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is that n is an integer. But then why is there an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7? Wait, maybe the example is wrong? Let me check.\n\nWait, the original problem is to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The user's formatted version lists assumptions as n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems conflicting. Because if the problem is for every integer n, then the assumption is just n is an integer. But the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\", which changes the problem. So maybe in the example, there was a mistake. But perhaps the user intended to demonstrate how to structure the problem, even if the example is incorrect. So maybe in their example, they added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the original problem didn't have that. So maybe the user made a mistake in their example. But regardless, the user wants the answer to follow their format, even if the example is flawed.\n\nSo, in the current problem, to structure it according to the example, the assumptions should list properties of the objects involved, each in one line.\n\nSo, the problem is to show that the set of irrational numbers is a Baire space. The assumptions would be:\n\n- The set of irrational numbers is considered with the subspace topology induced by the real numbers.\n- The real numbers with the standard topology form a Baire space.\n- The set of irrational numbers is a completely metrizable space.\n- The set of irrational numbers is a dense subset of the real numbers.\n\nBut perhaps some of these are not necessary. Alternatively, maybe the key assumption is that the irrationals are a completely metrizable space, as per the Baire category theorem. However, in the context of the problem, the user is probably working within the standard real numbers, so the main assumption is that the irrationals have the subspace topology. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe set of irrational numbers is a topological space with the subspace topology inherited from the real numbers,\nThe real numbers with the standard topology form a Baire space.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the set of irrational numbers is a Baire space.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is self-contained, and the only assumption is that the irrationals are a topological space with the subspace topology, and the problem is to show it's Baire. But the real numbers being Baire is a standard result (Baire category theorem), so that could be an assumption. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the user to know that completely metrizable spaces are Baire, and since the irrationals are completely metrizable (as a Polish space), hence they are Baire.\n\nBut the user wants the assumptions to be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe real numbers with the standard topology form a Baire space,\nThe set of irrational numbers is a dense G-delta subset of the real numbers,\nA dense G-delta subset of a Baire space is a Baire space.\n\nBut then the problem would be to apply these assumptions. However, maybe the problem doesn't state these assumptions explicitly, so the user is supposed to infer them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in a more general topological context, but the user is to structure the problem as presented. The original question is simply asking how to show the irrationals are a Baire space, so the assumptions would be the properties needed for the proof. However, according to the example, the assumptions are listed as given conditions in the problem. But in the original example, the problem states \"for every integer n\", which is an assumption, and the formatted version includes that as an assumption, but then adds another condition that \"n is divisible by 7\", which was not in the original problem. So perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user wants us to list assumptions that are either given in the problem or necessary for solving it.\n\nIn the current problem, since the question is just \"how to show...\", the assumptions would be the properties of the irrational numbers and the real numbers that are needed to apply certain theorems. So the key assumptions would be:\n\n- The real numbers are a Baire space.\n- The set of irrational numbers is a completely metrizable space.\n- The set of irrational numbers is a dense G-delta subset of the real numbers.\n\nBut perhaps the user wants the most basic assumptions. For instance, the real numbers are a Baire space (by Baire category theorem), and the irrationals are a dense G-delta in them. Then, a theorem states that a dense G-delta subset of a Baire space is also a Baire space. So the assumptions would include those.\n\nBut each assumption should be a single line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe real numbers with the standard topology form a Baire space,\nThe set of irrational numbers is a dense G-delta subset of the real numbers,\nA dense G-delta subset of a Baire space is itself a Baire space.\n\nBut maybe the third point is part of the reasoning, not an assumption. Alternatively, the problem might require assuming the theorem that dense G-delta subsets of Baire spaces are Baire.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to be structured with only the explicit assumptions needed, without stating the theorem. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe real numbers are a Baire space,\nThe set of irrational numbers is equipped with the subspace topology from the real numbers,\nThe set of irrational numbers is a completely metrizable space.\n\nThen the problem is to show that under these assumptions, the irrationals are a Baire space.\n\nBut I'm not sure. The user's example included assumptions that weren't all present in the original problem (like n divisible by 7 when the original problem was for every integer n), but perhaps that was a mistake. However, following the user's instructions, we need to extract the assumptions from the original problem. The original problem here is simply asking to show the irrationals are a Baire space. The only explicit information is the question. So the implicit assumptions would be:\n\n- The set of irrational numbers is considered as a topological space.\n- The topology on the irrational numbers is the subspace topology inherited from the real numbers.\n\nBut how does that help? Well, the real numbers are a Baire space, and the irrationals are a G-delta subset, hence they are also Baire.\n\nAlternatively, if the irrationals are completely metrizable, then by Baire's theorem, they are a Baire space.\n\nSo the assumptions might include:\n\n- The set of irrational numbers is a completely metrizable space.\n\nBut to be completely metrizable, you need a compatible complete metric. The irrationals are homeomorphic to the Baire space, which is completely metrizable.\n\nBut maybe the key assumption is that the irrationals are a Polish space (separable completely metrizable), hence Baire.\n\nHowever, the problem might not state these assumptions explicitly. Therefore, perhaps the formatted problem should list the minimal assumptions needed for the problem to be posed.\n\nIn summary, the problem as stated on Math Stack Exchange is: \"How to show that the set of irrational numbers is a Baire space?\" To structure this according to the user's format, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe set of irrational numbers is a topological space with the subspace topology inherited from the real numbers,\nThe real numbers with the standard topology form a Baire space.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the set of irrational numbers is a Baire space.\n\nThis seems to capture the necessary setup. The subspace topology is essential because otherwise, the properties might differ. The real numbers being a Baire space is a key assumption since the proof would likely use properties of the real numbers being Baire and the irrationals' relation to them.\n\nAnother approach could involve the fact that the irrationals are a completely metrizable space (as they can be given a complete metric), and every completely metrizable space is a Baire space. So the assumptions could be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe set of irrational numbers is a completely metrizable space.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the set of irrational numbers is a Baire space.\n\nBut this might be too brief. It depends on what the user considers as the necessary assumptions. Given the example provided, where the user included an assumption not originally stated (n divisible by 7), perhaps the assistant is expected to list all underlying assumptions, even if they're standard.\n\nIn conclusion, after considering different angles, the most appropriate formatting would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe set of irrational numbers is equipped with the subspace topology from the real numbers,\nThe real numbers with the standard topology form a Baire space.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the set of irrational numbers is a Baire space.\n\nThis lists the main topological structure and the Baire property of the reals as assumptions, leading to the problem statement.",
