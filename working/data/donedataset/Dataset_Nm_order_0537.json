    "AcceptedAnswer": "It is not surprising that you are finding this difficult, because it goes beyond basic divisibility rules -- it rather requires something which is essentially equivalent to the uniqueness of prime factorization.  [ Edit : Actually this is comment is incorrect -- as Robin Chapman's answer shows, it is possible to prove this using just divisibility rules.  In particular it is true in any integral domain.] I assume $a$ and $m$ are positive integers.  The first observation is that $a$ and $a+1$ are relatively prime: i.e., there is no integer $d > 1$ -- or equivalently, no prime number-- which divides both $a$ and $a+1$, for then $d$ would have to divide $(a+1) - a = 1$, so $d = 1$. Now the key step: since $a$ divides $m$, we may write $m = aM$ for some positive integer $M$.  So $a+1$ divides $aM$ and is relatively prime to $a$. I claim that this implies $a+1$ divides $M$.  Assuming this, we have $M = (a+1)N$, say, so altogether $m = aM = a(a+1)N$, so $a(a+1)$ divides $m$. The claim is a special case of: (Generalized) Euclid's Lemma: Let $a,b,c$ be positive integers.  Suppose $a$ divides $bc$ and $a$ is relatively prime to $b$.  Then $a$ divides $c$. A formal proof of this requires some work!  See for instance http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid's_lemma In particular, proving this is essentialy as hard as proving the fundamental theorem of arithmetic .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants the assumptions and the problem structured in a specific format. The original question is about proving that if a divides m and a+1 divides m, then a(a+1) divides m. \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property applied to one object. So the first assumption is that a divides m, which can be written as \"a divides m\". The second assumption is that a+1 divides m. So those are two separate assumptions.\n\nThe problem then is to prove that the product a(a+1) divides m. Wait, but in the example given, they included an assumption that n is divisible by 7. But in this problem, there's no mention of a and a+1 being coprime or anything. However, I remember that consecutive integers are coprime. So maybe that's a hidden assumption here. But the problem doesn't state that explicitly. The user just provided the original problem as \"If a | m and (a + 1) | m, prove a(a + 1) | m.\" So the assumptions are simply that a divides m and a+1 divides m. The fact that a and a+1 are coprime is a property that comes into play in the proof, but it's not an assumption given in the problem statement. Therefore, I shouldn't list it as an assumption. The problem assumes only the two divisibility conditions.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have two assumptions: a divides m, and (a + 1) divides m. The problem is to prove that a(a + 1) divides m. I need to make sure that each assumption is on a separate line. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem mentioned that the number is divisible by 91, and the assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original example, the problem statement was \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like maybe the user made a mistake? Wait, no, looking back, the original problem in the example was: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91. Then the formatted problem had assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems contradictory because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an extra condition that n is divisible by 7. That might have been an error in the example. Maybe the user intended to structure it differently. But regardless, the instructions say to filter unrelated information and structure the problem as per the format. \n\nIn the current problem, the user's original question is straightforward: If a divides m and a+1 divides m, prove that a(a+1) divides m. So the assumptions are just those two divisibility conditions. There's no need to add any other assumptions unless specified. The fact that a and a+1 are coprime is part of the proof, not an assumption given in the problem. Therefore, the assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\na divides m,\n(a + 1) divides m.\n\nProblem:\nProve that a(a + 1) divides m.\n\nThat's it. The user might have intended to include the coprimality as an assumption, but since it's not stated in the original problem, we shouldn't add it. The key is to list only the assumptions explicitly given in the problem. So the answer should follow that structure.",
