    "Content": "Let $X$ and $Y$ be two independent identically distributed random\n  variables. Prove that\n  $$E\\left(\\frac{XY}{X^2+Y^2}\\right) \\geqslant 0.$$ I tried to manipulate with the expression $\\dfrac{XY}{X^2+Y^2}$, e.g. tried to rewrite it in the form \n$$\\dfrac{XY}{X^2+Y^2} = \\dfrac{(X+Y)^2}{4(X^2+Y^2)} - \\dfrac{(X-Y)^2}{4(X^2+Y^2)}$$\nor even in the form:\n$$\\dfrac{XY}{X^2+Y^2} = \\dfrac{(X+Y)^2 - (X-Y)^2}{2(X+Y)^2 + 2(X-Y)^2}$$ but it didn't help much. I am interested to see a proof of this fact or some favorable ideas that may help here. Reference: The problem was proposed in the Kolmogorov Students' Competition in Probability Theory, 2017.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here is a proof: $$ \\Bbb{E}\\left[\\frac{XY}{X^2+Y^2}\\right]\n= \\Bbb{E}\\left[ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} XY e^{-(X^2+Y^2)t} \\, dt \\right]\n= \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\Bbb{E}[X e^{-X^2 t}]\\Bbb{E}[Y e^{-Y^2 t}] \\, dt \\geq 0. $$ Addendum. My observation is that the expectation can be thought as a quadratic form on the space of finite measures. Indeed, if $\\mu$ is the common law of $X$ and $Y$, then $$ \\Bbb{E}\\left[ \\frac{XY}{X^2+Y^2}\\right] = \\int_{\\Bbb{R}^2} \\frac{xy}{x^2+y^2} \\, \\mu(dx)\\mu(dy). $$ So the problem boils down to showing that this form is positive semi-definite. One such way is to find a unitary transformation under which the quadratic form reduces to the usual $2$-norm. Such a transform are often given as integral transformation: $$ L\\mu(t) = \\int_{\\Bbb{R}} k(t, x) \\, \\mu(dx). $$ Assuming that $L$ provides such a transformation, it should satisfy $$ \\int_{\\Bbb{R}^2} \\frac{xy}{x^2+y^2} \\, \\mu(dx)\\mu(dy)\n= \\int_{\\Bbb{R}} (L\\mu(t))^2 \\, dt\n= \\int_{\\Bbb{R}^2} \\left(\\int_{\\Bbb{R}} k(t, x)k(t, y) \\, dt \\right) \\mu(dx)\\mu(dy). $$ When the dust settles down, it becomes clear what we should hunt: a function $k$ such that $$ \\frac{xy}{x^2+y^2} = \\int_{\\Bbb{R}} k(t, x)k(t, y) \\, dt. $$ It is not hard to guess such a function, and indeed my proof uses $k(t, x) = x e^{-x^2 t} \\mathbf{1}_{\\{t \\geq 0\\}}$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me read through the original question carefully.\n\nThe problem is about proving that the expectation E[XY/(X² + Y²)] is non-negative when X and Y are i.i.d. random variables. The user tried some algebraic manipulations but didn't get anywhere. The reference mentions it's from a competition in 2017.\n\nFirst, listing assumptions. The key points here are:\n\n1. X and Y are independent. That's one assumption.\n2. X and Y are identically distributed. That's another assumption.\n3. The expectation is taken over these variables. But since that's part of the problem statement, maybe it's not an assumption. Wait, the problem is about the expectation, so the main assumptions are the independence and identical distribution.\n\nWait, the original problem states \"for i.i.d. X and Y\". So i.i.d. includes both independent and identically distributed. But in the example given, the assumptions were split into separate lines. Like in the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" were separate. So here, maybe split into two assumptions: X and Y are independent, and X and Y are identically distributed. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So:\n\nAssumption: \nX and Y are independent,\nX and Y are identically distributed.\n\nProblem: Prove that E[XY/(X² + Y²)] ≥ 0.\n\nI think that's it. The problem doesn't have any other stated conditions, like specific distributions or anything else. The user tried some algebraic forms, but those are part of their attempts, not part of the problem's assumptions. So the main assumptions are independence and identical distribution. The problem is to show the expectation is non-negative. \n\nI should check if there's anything else. The problem is in probability theory, so the variables are real-valued, but since they are random variables, that's a given. No need to state they are real unless specified. The problem doesn't mention any specific constraints on X and Y beyond being i.i.d., so the assumptions are just the two points.",
