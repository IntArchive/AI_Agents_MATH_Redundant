    "Content": "I have a little project of mine, where I'm basically trying to prove most\nof the properties of polynomial functions without using any calculus whatsoever. I've been able to show, using the completeness of the real numbers, that if a polynomial function $f: \\mathbf{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{R}$ is such that $f(a) f(b) < 0$ for some reals $a < b$ , then there exists a real number $c \\in (a, b)$ such that $f(c) = 0$ . Then, I defined the concept of the derivative polynomial: Let $f: \\mathbf{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{R}$ the polynomial function given by $\\displaystyle f(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^n a_k x^k$ for all $x \\in \\mathbf{R}$ . We define the derivative of $f$ as the polynomial function $f' : \\mathbf{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{R}$ given by $\\displaystyle f'(x) = \\sum_{k=1}^n k a_k x^{k-1}$ for all $x \\in \\mathbf{R}$ . I am trying to show, by elementary means, that if $a < b$ and $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in (a, b)$ , then $f$ is increasing on $(a, b)$ , but I have no idea on how to do that.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This assumes that it is ok to use that $[x,y]$ is compact (which follows from the completeness which you already used and the fact that such an interval is totally bounded). Let $x,y\\in (a,b)$ and $x<y$ . Let $z\\in [x,y]$ . Note that there is a polynomial $g$ such that $$\\frac{f(z+h)-f(z)}{h}=f'(z)+hg(h)$$ for $h\\in\\Bbb R\\setminus\\{0\\}$ . This follows purely algebraically from the algebraic definition of the derivative. By assumption $f'(z)\\gt0$ . It is not hard to see that polynomials are bounded on bounded intervals, hence for $h\\gt0$ small enough, i.e. for $h\\lt f'(z)/M$ where $M$ is some bound for $|g|$ , we have $f'(z)+hg(h)\\gt0$ , hence $f(z+h)\\gt f(z)$ . Similarly for $h\\lt0$ small enough in absolute value we have $f(z)\\gt f(z+h)$ . Thus for all $z\\in[x,y]$ there is some $h\\gt0$ such that $$f(z-h')\\lt f(z)\\lt f(z+h')$$ for all $0\\lt h'\\lt h$ . As $[x,y]$ is (assumed to be) compact, there are a finite number of $x=z_1\\lt \\dots \\lt z_n=y$ and $h_1,\\dots,h_n\\gt0$ such that $[x,y]\\subseteq\\bigcup_{i=1}^n (z_i-h_i,z_i+h_i)$ and that $f(z_i-h')\\lt f(z_i)\\lt f(z_i+h')$ for $0<h'<h_i$ . This then implies that $f(x)\\lt f(y)$ as follows: There is some $i\\gt 1$ such that $(z_1-h_1,z_1+h_1)\\cap (z_i-h_i,z_i+h_i)\\ne\\emptyset$ , let then $$z\\in (z_1-h_1,z_1+h_1)\\cap (z_i-h_i,z_i+h_i)$$ where we may assume $z_1\\lt z\\lt z_i$ , so we can write $z=z_1+h_1'=z_i-h_i'$ with $h_1'\\lt h_1,h_i'\\lt h_i$ . Thus $f(x)=f(z_1)\\lt f(z_1+h_1')=f(z_i-h_i')\\lt f(z_i)$ . Then we can pick some $j\\gt i$ such that $f(z_j)\\gt f(z_i)$ and so on. As we have only a finite number of $z_i$ this has to stop at some point which can only be $z_n=y$ , so $f(x)=f(z_1)\\lt f(z_i)\\lt f(z_j)\\lt \\dots\\lt f(y)$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the user wants to show that if a polynomial function has a derivative (defined as another polynomial) that's positive everywhere on an interval (a, b), then the original function is increasing on that interval. And they want to do this without using calculus. Hmm, interesting.\n\nFirst, let me recall the definitions given. The derivative polynomial f' is defined term-by-term, similar to the calculus derivative, but without invoking limits. So, for a polynomial f(x) = sum_{k=0}^n a_k x^k, the derivative is f'(x) = sum_{k=1}^n k a_k x^{k-1}. That makes sense. It's like the formal derivative in algebra.\n\nThe goal is to show that if f'(x) > 0 for all x in (a, b), then f is increasing on (a, b). In calculus, this would follow directly from the Mean Value Theorem, but here we can't use that. So we need an elementary method.\n\nLet me think about polynomials and their behavior. Maybe I can use the concept of difference quotients or algebraic manipulations. Since f is a polynomial, maybe expanding f(y) - f(x) for y > x in (a, b) could help. Let's try that.\n\nTake two points x and y in (a, b) with y > x. We need to show that f(y) > f(x). Consider f(y) - f(x). If we can show this difference is positive whenever y > x, then f is increasing.\n\nExpressing f(y) - f(x) as the sum from k=0^n a_k (y^k - x^k). Each term y^k - x^k can be factored as (y - x)(y^{k-1} + y^{k-2}x + ... + x^{k-1}). So, f(y) - f(x) = (y - x) * sum_{k=1}^n a_k [y^{k-1} + y^{k-2}x + ... + x^{k-1}].\n\nWait, but how does this relate to the derivative f'? The derivative f'(x) is sum_{k=1}^n k a_k x^{k-1}. The expression we have here is similar but involves terms with both y and x. Maybe if we can relate this sum to the derivative evaluated at some point between x and y?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the Mean Value Theorem's algebraic counterpart. If I can show that f(y) - f(x) = (y - x)f'(c) for some c in (x, y), then since f'(c) > 0, it would follow that f(y) - f(x) > 0. But wait, the Mean Value Theorem is part of calculus. The user wants to avoid calculus. So, can we prove this equality without using calculus?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use induction on the degree of the polynomial. For a linear polynomial, f'(x) is a constant (the coefficient of x), so if it's positive, f is increasing. For higher degrees, maybe decompose the polynomial into parts where the derivative condition can be applied recursively. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: The derivative f' is defined as a polynomial that's always positive on (a, b). Since f' is a polynomial, it's continuous (but continuity is usually shown via calculus). Wait, the user already mentioned using completeness of real numbers for the Intermediate Value Theorem, so maybe continuity is acceptable here. If f' is positive on (a, b), then the function f is increasing because the \"slope\" is always positive. But again, how to formalize this without calculus?\n\nWait, maybe use the fact that polynomials can be expressed in terms of their roots. If f' is always positive, then it has no real roots in (a, b), so maybe f is monotonic. But how to connect the derivative's positivity to the function's increasing nature?\n\nAlternatively, use the concept of a polynomial's behavior between its critical points. If there are no critical points in (a, b) because f' is always positive, then f must be either always increasing or always decreasing. But since f' is positive, it's increasing. But again, this seems to rely on calculus concepts.\n\nPerhaps another way: For any two points x < y in (a, b), consider the polynomial restricted to [x, y]. If the derivative is positive, then the function's values increase as we move from x to y. Maybe use a telescoping sum or partition the interval [x, y] into small steps, but without limits. For example, take points x = x_0 < x_1 < ... < x_n = y, and look at the sum of f(x_{i+1}) - f(x_i). Each difference can be approximated using the derivative at some point, but again, this is similar to the Mean Value Theorem.\n\nAlternatively, consider expanding f(y) - f(x) using the derivative. For polynomials, we can write f(y) - f(x) = integral from x to y of f'(t) dt, but that's calculus again. However, since we're dealing with polynomials, maybe there's an algebraic version of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. For instance, if we have f'(x) as the formal derivative, then integrating term-by-term would give back f(x) plus a constant. But integration is part of calculus. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe for polynomials, the equality f(y) - f(x) = (y - x) * f'((x + y)/2) doesn't hold, but perhaps there's an algebraic identity that allows expressing the difference as a product involving the derivative. Let me check with a quadratic function. Let f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c. Then f'(x) = 2ax + b. The difference f(y) - f(x) = a(y^2 - x^2) + b(y - x) = (y - x)(a(y + x) + b) = (y - x)(2a*( (x+y)/2 ) + b ) = (y - x)f'((x+y)/2). Wait, that's exactly the Mean Value Theorem for quadratics! For a quadratic polynomial, the difference over y - x is equal to the derivative at the midpoint. So in this case, if f' is always positive, then f(y) - f(x) = (y - x)f'(midpoint) > 0. Hence, f is increasing.\n\nInteresting! So for quadratics, this works. What about cubics? Let f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d. Then f'(x) = 3ax^2 + 2bx + c. The difference f(y) - f(x) = a(y^3 - x^3) + b(y^2 - x^2) + c(y - x) = (y - x)[a(y^2 + yx + x^2) + b(y + x) + c]. Compare this to (y - x)f'(m) where m is some mean value. Let's compute f'(m) = 3a m^2 + 2b m + c. If we set m such that 3a m^2 + 2b m + c = a(y^2 + yx + x^2) + b(y + x) + c, then it would require 3a m^2 + 2b m = a(y^2 + yx + x^2) + b(y + x). Not sure if there's an m that satisfies this. For example, let’s take a specific cubic: f(x) = x^3. Then f'(x) = 3x^2. The difference f(y) - f(x) = y^3 - x^3 = (y - x)(y^2 + yx + x^2). The derivative at some m would be 3m^2. So setting 3m^2 = y^2 + yx + x^2. Then m^2 = (y^2 + yx + x^2)/3. So m would be sqrt[(y^2 + yx + x^2)/3], which is not the midpoint but a different point. However, this shows that for the cubic case, there exists an m between x and y (since (y^2 + yx + x^2)/3 is between x^2 and y^2 when x < y) such that f(y) - f(x) = (y - x)f'(m). Therefore, even for cubics, there exists such an m, hence if f' is positive everywhere on (a, b), then f(y) - f(x) > 0 whenever y > x.\n\nBut wait, this seems to be reinventing the Mean Value Theorem for polynomials specifically. But the user wants an elementary proof without calculus. However, if we can establish for polynomials that f(y) - f(x) = (y - x)f'(m) for some m in (x, y), then since f'(m) > 0, the result follows. But how to prove this identity for general polynomials without using calculus?\n\nAlternatively, note that for any polynomial f, the difference f(y) - f(x) can be written as (y - x) times the derivative evaluated at some point m. This is actually the Mean Value Theorem for polynomials, which can be proven algebraically without calculus. Since polynomials are differentiable in the algebraic sense, perhaps this can be shown by induction on the degree.\n\nBase case: degree 1. For f(x) = ax + b, f'(x) = a. Then f(y) - f(x) = a(y - x) = (y - x)f'(x), so m can be any point, since derivative is constant.\n\nAssume it's true for polynomials of degree ≤ n. Now consider a polynomial of degree n+1. Let f(x) = a_{n+1}x^{n+1} + ... + a_0. Then f'(x) = (n+1)a_{n+1}x^n + ... + a_1. The difference f(y) - f(x) = a_{n+1}(y^{n+1} - x^{n+1}) + ... + a_1(y - x). The term y^{n+1} - x^{n+1} factors as (y - x)(y^n + y^{n-1}x + ... + x^n). So, similar to the cubic case, we can factor out (y - x) from each term, leading to f(y) - f(x) = (y - x)[a_{n+1}(y^n + y^{n-1}x + ... + x^n) + ... + a_1]. Now, compare this to f'(m) which is (n+1)a_{n+1}m^n + ... + a_1. We need to show that there exists an m between x and y such that [a_{n+1}(y^n + y^{n-1}x + ... + x^n) + ... + a_1] = (n+1)a_{n+1}m^n + ... + a_1. This seems non-trivial, but perhaps for polynomials, this expression in the brackets is equal to f'(m) for some m. For the highest degree term, we have a_{n+1}(y^n + y^{n-1}x + ... + x^n) = a_{n+1}(n+1)m^n, where m is the average or some mean. Wait, for the term y^n + y^{n-1}x + ... + x^n, there's a formula that this sum is equal to (n+1)m^n where m is the arithmetic mean of x and y? No, that's not true. For example, when n=2: y^2 + yx + x^2 is not equal to 3((x + y)/2)^2. Let's compute: 3((x+y)/2)^2 = 3(x^2 + 2xy + y^2)/4 = (3x² + 6xy + 3y²)/4, which is different from y² + yx + x². So that doesn't hold. However, note that y^n + y^{n-1}x + ... + x^n is equal to (y^{n+1} - x^{n+1})/(y - x). Wait, yes, that's the formula for the sum of a geometric series. So actually, y^n + y^{n-1}x + ... + x^n = (y^{n+1} - x^{n+1})/(y - x). But this is exactly the factorization we used earlier. So, perhaps there's a way to relate this sum to the derivative of x^{n+1}, which is (n+1)x^n. So, maybe this sum y^n + y^{n-1}x + ... + x^n = (n+1)m^n for some m between x and y. But how?\n\nAlternatively, consider that for the function f(x) = x^{n+1}, the derivative is (n+1)x^n. Then, the difference f(y) - f(x) = y^{n+1} - x^{n+1} = (y - x)(y^n + y^{n-1}x + ... + x^n). This equals (y - x) times the sum S = y^n + y^{n-1}x + ... + x^n. Now, if we can show that S = (n+1)m^n for some m between x and y, then we have f(y) - f(x) = (y - x)(n+1)m^n = (y - x)f'(m), which is exactly the Mean Value Theorem for this function. But how to prove that S equals (n+1)m^n for some m?\n\nThis seems related to the Power Mean Theorem or some other mean value concept. Alternatively, since S is a symmetric function in x and y, perhaps m is a kind of mean. For example, when n=1, S = y + x, and (n+1)m^n = 2m, so 2m = y + x ⇒ m = (x + y)/2. Which matches the linear case. For n=2, S = y² + yx + x², and we need 3m² = y² + yx + x². Solving for m gives m = sqrt[(y² + yx + x²)/3]. This is the root mean square of x and y, but adjusted. However, this m is between x and y if x and y are positive, but generally, if x < y, is this m in (x, y)? Let's see: Suppose x < y. Then x² < y², so (y² + yx + x²)/3 is between x² and y². Therefore, m is between x and y. Because if x and y are positive, then sqrt((x² + xy + y²)/3) is between x and y. Similarly, if x and y are negative, or one is positive and one is negative, but since we're dealing with an interval (a, b), maybe we can assume without loss of generality that they're both positive or adjust accordingly.\n\nThus, for each term in the polynomial, the difference can be expressed as (y - x) times the derivative at some m between x and y. Then, summing over all terms, the total difference f(y) - f(x) would be (y - x) times the sum of each term's derivative at their respective m's. But this complicates things, as each term might have a different m. However, if we can factor out (y - x) and have the sum of derivatives at various points, but since the derivative of the entire polynomial is the sum of the derivatives of each term, maybe there's a way to combine these into the derivative at a single m.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for the entire polynomial, there exists a single m such that f(y) - f(x) = (y - x)f'(m). This is the Mean Value Theorem for polynomials, and perhaps it can be proven algebraically by considering the polynomial f(y) - f(x) - (y - x)f'(z) and showing that it has a root z between x and y. Let's define g(z) = f(y) - f(x) - (y - x)f'(z). Then, if we can show that g(z) = 0 for some z between x and y, then we're done. Since f is a polynomial, g(z) is also a polynomial in z. Let's evaluate g at z = x and z = y. g(x) = f(y) - f(x) - (y - x)f'(x). g(y) = f(y) - f(x) - (y - x)f'(y). If we can show that g(x) and g(y) have opposite signs or one is zero, then by the Intermediate Value Theorem for polynomials (which the user already established), there exists a z between x and y such that g(z) = 0.\n\nBut how to show that g(x) and g(y) have opposite signs? Let's take a simple case, like f(x) = x^2. Then f'(x) = 2x. Then g(z) = y² - x² - (y - x)(2z) = (y - x)(y + x) - 2(y - x)z = (y - x)(y + x - 2z). Setting to zero gives z = (y + x)/2, which is between x and y. So it works. For another example, f(x) = x^3. Then f'(x) = 3x². g(z) = y³ - x³ - (y - x)3z² = (y - x)(y² + yx + x²) - 3(y - x)z² = (y - x)(y² + yx + x² - 3z²). Setting to zero requires y² + yx + x² = 3z², so z = sqrt[(y² + yx + x²)/3], which is between x and y as discussed earlier.\n\nSo in general, for any polynomial, defining g(z) as above, we can factor out (y - x) and obtain a polynomial equation in z. The question is whether this equation has a root between x and y. Since we have the Intermediate Value Theorem for polynomials (as the user mentioned proving it), if we can show that g(z) changes sign between z = x and z = y, then such a root exists.\n\nCompute g(x) = f(y) - f(x) - (y - x)f'(x). Similarly, g(y) = f(y) - f(x) - (y - x)f'(y). Let's compute g(x) and g(y):\n\nFor g(x): f(y) - f(x) - (y - x)f'(x). If we can relate this to the Taylor expansion or some expansion around x. But without calculus, perhaps expanding f(y) around x. For a polynomial, f(y) = f(x) + f'(x)(y - x) + (f''(x)/2)(y - x)^2 + ... + (f^{(n)}(x)/n!)(y - x)^n. Therefore, f(y) - f(x) - (y - x)f'(x) = (f''(x)/2)(y - x)^2 + ... + (f^{(n)}(x)/n!)(y - x)^n. This is a sum of terms with (y - x)^k, k ≥ 2. Since y > x, this expression is positive if the leading term is positive. However, the sign depends on the coefficients. But if all derivatives beyond the first are zero (i.e., the polynomial is linear), then this difference is zero. For higher-degree polynomials, this difference could be positive or negative. Therefore, g(x) might not necessarily be positive or negative. Similarly for g(y).\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider specific examples to see. Take f(x) = x^3, x = 0, y = 1. Then f(y) - f(x) = 1 - 0 = 1. (y - x)f'(x) = 1 * 0 = 0. So g(x) = 1 - 0 = 1 > 0. f'(y) = 3(1)^2 = 3. g(y) = 1 - 1*3 = -2 < 0. So g(x) > 0 and g(y) < 0, so by IVT, there's a z in (x, y) where g(z)=0. Which works. For another example, f(x) = x^2, x=1, y=2. f(y)-f(x)=4 -1=3. (y - x)f'(x)=1*2=2. g(x)=3-2=1>0. f'(y)=4. g(y)=3 -1*4= -1<0. Again, sign change. So maybe in general, for any polynomial of degree ≥2, g(x) and g(y) have opposite signs, hence by IVT, there's a root in (x, y). Therefore, proving that g(z)=0 has a solution between x and y, hence f(y) - f(x) = (y - x)f'(z), and since f'(z) >0, then f(y) -f(x) >0.\n\nTherefore, the steps would be:\n\n1. For any polynomial f and a < x < y < b, define g(z) = f(y) - f(x) - (y - x)f'(z).\n\n2. Show that g(z) is a polynomial in z.\n\n3. Evaluate g(x) and g(y) and show that g(x) >0 and g(y) <0 (or vice versa), hence by IVT, there exists c in (x, y) such that g(c)=0.\n\n4. Therefore, f(y) -f(x) = (y - x)f'(c).\n\n5. Since f'(c) >0 (given), then f(y) -f(x) >0, so f is increasing.\n\nBut how to generally show that g(x) and g(y) have opposite signs? Let's see for a general polynomial.\n\nTake f as a general polynomial. Compute g(x) = f(y) - f(x) - (y - x)f'(x). Similarly, g(y) = f(y) - f(x) - (y - x)f'(y).\n\nConsider expanding f(y) around x using Taylor series (though the user wants to avoid calculus). But since f is a polynomial, this expansion is algebraic. For example, f(y) = f(x) + f'(x)(y -x) + (1/2)f''(x)(y -x)^2 + ... + (1/n!)f^{(n)}(x)(y -x)^n.\n\nTherefore, g(x) = f(y) -f(x) - (y -x)f'(x) = (1/2)f''(x)(y -x)^2 + ... + (1/n!)f^{(n)}(x)(y -x)^n.\n\nSimilarly, expanding f(x) around y: f(x) = f(y) + f'(y)(x - y) + (1/2)f''(y)(x - y)^2 + ... + (1/n!)f^{(n)}(y)(x - y)^n.\n\nThus, f(x) - f(y) = f'(y)(x - y) + ... + (1/n!)f^{(n)}(y)(x - y)^n.\n\nTherefore, f(y) -f(x) = -[f'(y)(x - y) + ... ] = f'(y)(y -x) + ... + (1/n!)f^{(n)}(y)(y -x)^n.\n\nTherefore, g(y) = f(y) -f(x) - (y -x)f'(y) = [f'(y)(y -x) + ... + (1/n!)f^{(n)}(y)(y -x)^n] - (y -x)f'(y) = ... The first term cancels with the subtracted term, leaving g(y) = (1/2)f''(y)(y -x)^2 + ... + (1/n!)f^{(n)}(y)(y -x)^n.\n\nSo both g(x) and g(y) are sums of higher-order terms multiplied by positive quantities (since (y -x) >0 and squares, etc.). The signs of g(x) and g(y) depend on the derivatives. If the leading term (highest degree) of the polynomial is positive, then for large enough y -x, the sign would be determined by that term. But in our case, y and x are arbitrary in (a, b), so we can't assume y -x is large.\n\nHowever, if the polynomial f has degree at least 2, then the second derivative is non-zero, and so g(x) and g(y) would have terms involving the second derivative. But the problem allows f to be any polynomial, so we need a general approach.\n\nAlternatively, consider that for the polynomial g(z), which is of degree equal to the degree of f'(z) (since f'(z) is a polynomial of degree deg(f) -1, and g(z) is affine in f'(z)), the degree of g(z) is deg(f) -1. Wait, no: f'(z) is a polynomial, so g(z) = [f(y) - f(x)] - (y -x)f'(z). Since f(y) - f(x) is a constant with respect to z, and (y -x)f'(z) is a polynomial of degree deg(f) -1. Therefore, g(z) is a polynomial of degree deg(f) -1.\n\nNow, to apply IVT, we need to show that g(z) changes sign between z = x and z = y. Suppose deg(f) ≥1. If deg(f) =1, then f'(z) is a constant, and g(z) = [f(y)-f(x)] - (y -x)f'(z). But for a linear function, f(y) -f(x) = (y -x)f'(z), since f' is constant. Hence, g(z) =0 identically, so any z works. But if deg(f) ≥2, then g(z) is a non-constant polynomial.\n\nBut how do we know that g(z) changes sign between x and y? Let's suppose that f is increasing at x (f'(x) >0) but decreasing at y (f'(y) <0). Wait, no, the assumption is that f'(z) >0 for all z in (a, b). Therefore, f'(x) >0 and f'(y) >0. But in our case, the problem states that f'(x) >0 for all x in (a, b), so f' is always positive there. Hence, for the polynomial g(z) = C - (y -x)f'(z), where C = f(y) - f(x). Wait, no: g(z) is defined as f(y) - f(x) - (y -x)f'(z). So C is f(y) - f(x), and then subtract (y -x)f'(z).\n\nWait, maybe this is a better approach. Let's rearrange g(z):\n\ng(z) = [f(y) - f(x)] - (y -x)f'(z).\n\nIf we can show that there exists z in (x, y) such that g(z) =0, then we have f(y) -f(x) = (y -x)f'(z). But how?\n\nConsider that for z =x, g(x) = [f(y) - f(x)] - (y -x)f'(x).\n\nFor z =y, g(y) = [f(y) - f(x)] - (y -x)f'(y).\n\nIf we can show that g(x) >0 and g(y) <0, then by IVT, there's a z in (x, y) where g(z)=0.\n\nBut how to show that?\n\nLet’s consider the behavior of f. Since f' is always positive on (a, b), the function f is increasing (which is what we want to prove). If f is increasing, then f(y) -f(x) >0, and since f'(x) >0, (y -x)f'(x) >0. But g(x) = [f(y) -f(x)] - (y -x)f'(x). If f is increasing, then f(y) -f(x) >0, but we can't assume that yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use induction on the degree. Assume that for all polynomials of degree less than n, if their derivative is positive on an interval, then they're increasing. Then for degree n, if f' is positive, then f' is a polynomial of degree n-1 with positive leading coefficient. But induction might not directly apply here.\n\nAlternatively, consider that since f'(z) >0 for all z in (a, b), then f'(z) is always positive. Then, the function f is strictly increasing. But how to show this without calculus?\n\nAnother angle: Use the concept of convexity. If the derivative is increasing, the function is convex. But again, this is calculus.\n\nWait, the user mentioned they want to prove this without calculus, but they defined the derivative polynomial. Maybe use the definition of increasing function: for any x < y, f(y) > f(x). So take x < y in (a, b), and need to show f(y) > f(x). Suppose, for contradiction, that f(y) ≤ f(x). Then, consider the polynomial f(z) - f(x). It has a root at z =x. If f(y) ≤ f(x), then f(z) - f(x) ≤0 at z =y. By the IVT for polynomials (which they proved), if there's a sign change, there's a root. But since f'(z) >0 everywhere, maybe this leads to a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, suppose f(y) ≤ f(x). Then, since f'(z) >0 for all z in (x, y), the function can't decrease. But this is circular.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Since f' is positive on (a, b), then for any z in (a, b), the coefficient of the highest degree term in f' must be positive (since as z approaches infinity, f'(z) tends to infinity if leading coefficient is positive). Therefore, f(z) is eventually increasing. But this is vague.\n\nAlternatively, use induction on the degree. For degree 1, it's trivial. Assume true for degree n-1. For degree n, f'(x) is of degree n-1 and is positive on (a, b). Therefore, f' is increasing if its derivative (f'') is positive, but we don't know that. However, since f' is always positive, and it's a polynomial, maybe f' can be expressed as a product of irreducible factors (quadratic or linear) all positive on (a, b). Then, integrate f' from x to y to get f(y) -f(x), but integration is calculus.\n\nWait, but the user defined the derivative as a polynomial. Maybe there's an algebraic way to \"integrate\" f' to recover f, up to a constant. Since f is a polynomial, and the derivative is defined as the formal derivative, then f(y) - f(x) is equal to the sum from k=1^n a_k (y^k - x^k) = sum from k=1^n a_k (y -x)(y^{k-1} + y^{k-2}x + ... + x^{k-1}) ) = (y -x) * sum from k=1^n a_k (y^{k-1} + ... + x^{k-1}). Now, the sum inside is similar to evaluating the derivative at some point. For example, for each k, the term y^{k-1} + ... + x^{k-1} is equal to k times m^{k-1} for some m between x and y. Wait, as we saw earlier for quadratic and cubic cases. So maybe sum from k=1^n a_k (y^{k-1} + ... + x^{k-1}) = sum from k=1^n a_k *k * m^{k-1} for some m between x and y. Which is exactly f'(m). Therefore, f(y) -f(x) = (y -x)f'(m). Hence, if f'(m) >0, then f(y) >f(x).\n\nBut how to justify that the sum equals f'(m)? This seems to require that there exists an m such that sum_{k=1}^n a_k (y^{k-1} + ... + x^{k-1}) = sum_{k=1}^n a_k k m^{k-1}. This is equivalent to finding an m such that for each k, y^{k-1} + ... + x^{k-1} = k m^{k-1}. But this is only possible if such an m exists for each k, which isn't generally true. However, as shown earlier, for each monomial x^k, there exists an m such that the difference y^k -x^k =k m^{k-1}(y -x). This is the Mean Value Theorem for each monomial, and since the derivative of the polynomial is the sum of the derivatives of the monomials, perhaps the same m works for the entire polynomial. However, this is not necessarily the case. Each monomial might require a different m. Therefore, the sum would be sum_{k=1}^n a_k k m_k^{k-1} for different m_k's. But we need a single m that works for all terms. This seems complicated unless all m_k's are the same, which is unlikely.\n\nTherefore, this approach might not hold. However, earlier when considering specific examples, we saw that for the entire polynomial, there exists an m such that f(y) -f(x) = (y -x)f'(m), by defining g(z) and applying IVT. Since g(z) is a polynomial, and if we can show g(x) and g(y) have opposite signs, then such an m exists.\n\nBut how to show that g(x) and g(y) have opposite signs? Let's take two examples.\n\nFirst example: f(x) = x^2, a=0, b=2. Take x=1, y=2. Then f(y)-f(x)=4 -1=3. (y -x)f'(x)=1*2=2. So g(x)=3-2=1>0. f'(y)=4. g(y)=3 -1*4= -1<0. So g(x) >0, g(y) <0. Hence, by IVT, there's a c in (1,2) with g(c)=0.\n\nSecond example: f(x)=x^3, x=1, y=2. f(y)-f(x)=8 -1=7. (y -x)f'(x)=1*3*1=3. g(x)=7-3=4>0. f'(y)=3*4=12. g(y)=7 -1*12= -5<0. Again, g(x) >0, g(y) <0.\n\nThird example: f(x)=x^4, x=1, y=2. f(y)-f(x)=16 -1=15. (y -x)f'(x)=1*4*1^3=4. g(x)=15-4=11>0. f'(y)=4*8=32. g(y)=15 -1*32= -17<0. Again, opposite signs.\n\nFourth example: f(x)=x + 1, x=0, y=1. f(y)-f(x)=2 -1=1. (y -x)f'(x)=1*1=1. g(x)=1-1=0. g(y)=1 -1*1=0. So here, g(z)=0 for all z, since it's linear. But in this case, f'(z)=1>0, and f is increasing.\n\nAnother example: f(x) = -x^2. Wait, but f'(x) = -2x. If we take an interval where f'(x) >0, say x in (-∞,0). Let x=-2, y=-1. Then f(y) -f(x) = -1 - (-4)=3. (y -x)f'(x)= (1) * (-2*(-2))=4. So g(x)=3 -4= -1<0. f'(y)= -2*(-1)=2. g(y)=3 - (1)*2=1>0. So g(x) <0, g(y) >0. Still opposite signs. Thus, in this case, there exists c between x and y with g(c)=0. Even though the function is concave, since f'(x) >0 in the interval (a, b) = (-∞,0), then f is increasing there (since derivative is positive). Indeed, f(x) =-x² is increasing on (-∞,0).\n\nSo, it seems that regardless of the polynomial, as long as f'(z) >0 on (a, b), then for any x < y in (a, b), g(x) and g(y) have opposite signs, leading to a root in between, hence f(y) -f(x) = (y -x)f'(c) >0. Therefore, f is increasing.\n\nThus, the proof would proceed by:\n\n1. Given f is a polynomial with derivative f' >0 on (a, b).\n\n2. Take any x < y in (a, b).\n\n3. Define g(z) = f(y) - f(x) - (y -x)f'(z).\n\n4. Show that g(x) >0 and g(y) <0, hence by IVT, there exists c in (x, y) with g(c)=0.\n\n5. Therefore, f(y) -f(x) = (y -x)f'(c) >0, since f'(c) >0.\n\n6. Hence, f is increasing on (a, b).\n\nBut how to generally show that g(x) >0 and g(y) <0?\n\nWait, in the previous examples, when f'(z) >0 everywhere, and f is increasing, then f(y) -f(x) >0, and (y -x)f'(x) is positive. But why is f(y) -f(x) > (y -x)f'(x) for g(x) >0?\n\nBecause if f is increasing, the difference f(y) -f(x) is the integral of f' from x to y, which is greater than (y -x) times the minimum of f' on [x, y], which is f'(x) if f' is increasing. But we don't know if f' is increasing. However, since f' is a polynomial that's positive on [x, y], the average of f' over [x, y] is greater than the minimum. But this is calculus again.\n\nAlternatively, using the algebraic approach, expand f(y) -f(x) using the polynomial's terms. For example, f(y) -f(x) = sum_{k=1}^n a_k (y^k -x^k). Each term y^k -x^k = (y -x)sum_{i=0}^{k-1} y^{k-1-i}x^i. Thus, f(y) -f(x) = (y -x)sum_{k=1}^n a_k sum_{i=0}^{k-1} y^{k-1-i}x^i.\n\nOn the other hand, (y -x)f'(x) = (y -x)sum_{k=1}^n a_k k x^{k-1}.\n\nThus, g(x) = f(y) -f(x) - (y -x)f'(x) = (y -x)[sum_{k=1}^n a_k (sum_{i=0}^{k-1} y^{k-1-i}x^i - k x^{k-1})].\n\nThis simplifies to (y -x)sum_{k=2}^n a_k [sum_{i=0}^{k-1} y^{k-1-i}x^i -k x^{k-1}].\n\nFor k ≥2, the term sum_{i=0}^{k-1} y^{k-1-i}x^i is a sum of k terms, while k x^{k-1} is a single term. The difference is sum_{i=0}^{k-1} y^{k-1-i}x^i -k x^{k-1} = sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (y^{k-1-i}x^i -x^{k-1}).\n\nThis can be written as sum_{i=0}^{k-1} x^i (y^{k-1-i} -x^{k-1-i}).\n\nFor each i from 0 to k-1, y^{k-1-i} -x^{k-1-i} is positive if y >x and k-1-i ≥1 (i.e., i ≤k-2). For i =k-1, the term becomes x^{k-1}(y^{0} -x^{0})=0. So the sum is sum_{i=0}^{k-2} x^i (y^{k-1-i} -x^{k-1-i}).\n\nSince y >x and k-1-i ≥1 (because i ≤k-2), each term y^{k-1-i} -x^{k-1-i} is positive. Therefore, the entire sum is positive. Thus, for each k ≥2, the expression sum_{i=0}^{k-1} y^{k-1-i}x^i -k x^{k-1} is positive. Therefore, g(x) = (y -x)sum_{k=2}^n a_k [positive terms]. The sign depends on the coefficients a_k. However, we don't know the signs of a_k. But given that f'(z) >0 for all z in (a, b), which includes x, we have f'(x) = sum_{k=1}^n a_k k x^{k-1} >0. But how does this relate to the coefficients a_k?\n\nThis approach seems complicated. Maybe it's better to use the earlier method with g(z) and the IVT.\n\nIn conclusion, the key steps are:\n\n1. For any x < y in (a, b), define g(z) = f(y) - f(x) - (y -x)f'(z).\n\n2. Show that g(z) is a polynomial.\n\n3. Evaluate g(x) and g(y) and demonstrate they have opposite signs.\n\n4. Apply the IVT for polynomials to find c in (x, y) where g(c) =0.\n\n5. Thus, f(y) -f(x) = (y -x)f'(c) >0, proving f is increasing.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should capture the assumptions: f is a polynomial function, the derivative f' is positive on (a, b), and the problem is to show f is increasing on (a, b).",
