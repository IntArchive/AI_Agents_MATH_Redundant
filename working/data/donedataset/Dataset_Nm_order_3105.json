    "Content": "Exercise 26 page 115 of Linear Algebra Done Right by Sheldon Axler is the following: Suppose $V$ is finite-dimensional and $\\Gamma$ is a subspace of $V'$. Show that $$\\Gamma=\\{v\\in V:\\varphi(v)=0\\text{ for every }\\varphi\\in\\Gamma\\}^0$$ where $V'$ is the dual space of $V$ and, for any $S\\subset V$, $S^0$ is the annihilator of $S$. Attempt: Let $S=\\{v\\in V:\\varphi(v)=0\\text{ for every }\\varphi\\in\\Gamma\\}$. Clearly, $\\Gamma\\subset S^0$.I tried to show that $S^0\\subset\\Gamma$ using some bases of $V$ and $V'$, but I failed. I also tried to show that $\\dim{\\Gamma}=\\dim{V}-\\dim{S}=\\dim{S^°}$. If $s_1,\\dots,s_n$ is a basis of $S$ and $s_1',\\dots,s_n'$ its dual, and if $\\psi_1,\\dots,\\psi_p$ is a basis of $\\Gamma$, it's easy to see that $s_1',\\dots,s_n',\\psi_1,\\dots,\\psi_p$ is a linearly independent list of $V'$. Also, if you extend $s_1,\\dots,s_n$ to a basis $s_1,\\dots,s_n,v_1,\\dots,v_m$ of $V$, then its dual $s_1',\\dots,s_n',v_1',\\dots,v_m'$ is a basis of $V'$; in fact $S^0=\\text{span}\\{v_1',\\dots,v_m'\\}$. Two remarkable facts:$$\\forall i\\in[1,m],\\,\\exists j\\in[1,p],\\,\\psi_j(v_i)\\neq0$$ because $v_j\\notin S$, and $$\\forall i\\in[1,p],\\,\\exists j\\in[1,m],\\,\\psi_i(v_j)\\neq 0$$ because $\\psi_i\\neq 0$; in other words the matrix of the inclusion map from $\\Gamma$ to $V'$ with respect to the basis of $\\Gamma$ and the dual base of the chosen basis of $V$ has no $0$ row nor $0$ column. But this doesn't seem to provide a way to prove that any linear comination of the $(v_i')_{1\\le i\\le m}$ is a linear combination of the elements of the basis of $\\Gamma$. I believe that $v_1,\\dots, v_m$ should be chosen more carefuly but I fail to. Could you please help me? Thank you in advance!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "For a subspace $T\\subseteq V'$ define $T^0 := \\{v\\in V\\,|\\, \\varphi(v) = 0\\text{ for all $\\varphi\\in T$}\\}$ (which is the same as your definition under the identification $V = V''$ ). In your case, we have $\\Gamma^0 = S$ . Then we have $\\dim V = \\dim U + \\dim U^0$ for each subspace $U\\subseteq V$ : Take a basis $u_1,\\dotsc,u_d$ of $U$ and complete it to a basis $u_1,\\dotsc,u_n$ of $V$ . Denoting by $u'_1,\\dotsc,u'_n$ the dual basis, it is easy to see that $U^0$ is spanned by $u'_{d+1},\\dotsc,u'_n$ , which proves the claim. Likewise, we have $\\dim V' = \\dim T + \\dim T^0$ for any subspace $T\\subseteq V'$ . More precisely, let $\\varphi_1,\\dotsc,\\varphi_d$ be a basis of $T$ and complete it to a basis $\\varphi_1,\\dotsc,\\varphi_n$ of $V'$ . Then it follows directly from the definitions that $T^0 = \\bigcap_{i=1}^d \\ker\\varphi_i$ . It remains to check that $\\dim \\bigcap_{i=1}^d \\ker \\varphi_i = n-d$ . Indeed, putting $W_j = \\bigcap_{i=1}^j \\ker\\varphi_i$ , for $j=1,\\dotsc,d$ , we obtain an increasing chain $$\n0 = W_n \\subset W_{n-1} \\subset\\dotsb \\subset W_1 \\subset V.\n$$ Since obviously $\\dim W_j \\ge \\dim W_{j+1} \\ge \\dim W_j-1$ , for all $j$ , and $\\dim W_1 = n -1$ , we must in fact have $\\dim W_j = n-j$ . In particular, $$\n\\dim T^0 = \\dim \\bigcap_{i=1}^d\\ker\\varphi_i = \\dim W_d = n-d = \\dim V' - \\dim T.\n$$ Now, it follows that $T^{00} = T$ for $T\\subseteq V'$ : $T\\subseteq T^{00}$ is clear and both have the same dimension, because of $$\\dim T = \\dim V' - \\dim T^0 = \\dim V - \\dim T^0 = \\dim T^{00}.$$ With this, we conclude $\\Gamma = \\Gamma^{00} = S^0$ (using $\\Gamma^0 = S$ for the last equality).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to help format this problem from Math Stack Exchange according to the given structure. Let's read through the original question carefully.\n\nThe title is \"Every subspace of the dual of a finite-dimensional vector space is an annihilator\". The user is working on Exercise 26 from Axler's Linear Algebra Done Right, page 115. The problem states: Suppose V is finite-dimensional and Γ is a subspace of V'. Show that Γ is equal to the annihilator of the set S, where S consists of all vectors v in V such that φ(v) = 0 for every φ in Γ. The user attempted a proof, discussed bases, dimensions, and inclusion of subspaces, but is stuck on showing the reverse inclusion.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem mentions V is finite-dimensional. Γ is a subspace of the dual space V'. The goal is to show Γ equals the annihilator of S, where S is defined as the set of vectors annihilated by all φ in Γ.\n\nLooking at the example given, assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption 1: V is a finite-dimensional vector space. (This is stated explicitly in the problem.)\n\nAssumption 2: Γ is a subspace of V', the dual space of V. (Γ is given as a subspace of the dual.)\n\nProblem: Show that Γ equals the annihilator of S, where S is {v ∈ V : φ(v) = 0 for every φ ∈ Γ}.\n\nWait, but in the example, sometimes the assumptions include conditions on variables, like n being an integer. Here, the key assumptions are the finite-dimensionality of V and Γ being a subspace of the dual. The problem statement is about proving the equality of Γ and S⁰ where S is defined as above.\n\nSo the formatted problem should list these two assumptions and then the problem statement.\n\nLet me check if there's any other implicit assumption. The problem is about dual spaces and annihilators, which are standard concepts in linear algebra. The user didn't mention any specific field, so we can assume the base field is arbitrary unless specified, but since the problem doesn't specify, it's probably general. However, in the example, only the given explicit conditions are listed. So the assumptions here are just the two points.\n\nTherefore:\n\nAssumption: \nV is a finite-dimensional vector space,\nΓ is a subspace of V'.\n\nProblem: Show that Γ = {v ∈ V : φ(v) = 0 for every φ ∈ Γ}⁰.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, S is defined as {v ∈ V : φ(v)=0 for every φ ∈ Γ}, and then Γ is supposed to be equal to S⁰. The annihilator of S, which is S⁰, is the set of linear functionals in V' that annihilate every vector in S. But Γ is a subspace of V', so we need to show that Γ is exactly those functionals that annihilate all vectors in S.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the annihilator of a subset of V is a subset of V', right? So S is a subset of V, then S⁰ is the set of φ in V' such that φ(v) = 0 for all v in S. So the problem is to show that Γ = S⁰, where S is {v ∈ V : φ(v) = 0 for all φ ∈ Γ}.\n\nBut initially, Γ is a subspace of V', and S is defined as the set of vectors annihilated by every φ in Γ. Then S⁰ is the set of functionals annihilating S. So the problem is to show that Γ equals its double annihilator? Wait, but normally, the double annihilator of a subspace Γ of V' would be Γ⁰⁰, which is a subspace of V''. But here, since V is finite-dimensional, we can identify V'' with V, but the problem seems to be stating that Γ is equal to the annihilator of S, where S is the annihilator of Γ in V. Wait, maybe I need to be precise.\n\nIn the problem statement: Γ is a subspace of V'. S is defined as {v ∈ V : φ(v)=0 for every φ ∈ Γ}. So S is the annihilator of Γ in V. Then S⁰ is the annihilator of S in V', which should be Γ again, right? But the problem is presented as \"Show that Γ = ...\" So the problem is to show that Γ is equal to the annihilator of its own annihilator in V. In finite dimensions, this should hold because of the double annihilator theorem. But maybe Axler hasn't covered that, so the exercise is to prove it directly.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. V is finite-dimensional.\n\n2. Γ is a subspace of V' (the dual space).\n\nProblem: Show that Γ is equal to the annihilator of S, where S is {v ∈ V : φ(v)=0 for all φ ∈ Γ}.\n\nSo the formatted problem should list these two assumptions and then the problem statement. The user's attempt already mentions that Γ is a subset of S⁰, and they need to show the reverse inclusion. The key is probably using dimensions. Since V is finite-dimensional, we can use dimension arguments. The annihilator relationship gives that dim Γ + dim S = dim V, and similarly, dim S⁰ + dim S = dim V. So dim Γ = dim S⁰, and since Γ is a subspace of S⁰, they must be equal.\n\nBut the user tried using bases and dual bases but got stuck. So in terms of assumptions, the main ones are the finite-dimensionality of V and Γ being a subspace of V'. The problem is to show Γ equals S⁰ where S is the annihilator of Γ.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem is:\n\nAssumption:\nV is a finite-dimensional vector space,\nΓ is a subspace of V'.\n\nProblem:\nShow that Γ = {v ∈ V : φ(v) = 0 for every φ ∈ Γ}⁰.\n\nBut wait, in LaTeX, the problem statement should be written properly. Let me check the original problem statement again. The user writes:\n\n\"Show that Γ = {v ∈ V : φ(v)=0 for every φ ∈ Γ}⁰\"\n\nBut actually, Γ is a subspace of V', so the annihilator of S (which is a subset of V) is a subset of V'. So the problem is to show Γ equals S⁰ where S is {v ∈ V : φ(v)=0 for all φ ∈ Γ}. That is, Γ = S⁰. So the problem statement is correct as written.\n\nSo in the formatted problem, the problem line should be:\n\nProblem: Show that Γ = {v ∈ V : φ(v) = 0 for every φ ∈ Γ}⁰.\n\nYes. Therefore, the answer should be structured as per the example, listing each assumption on a separate line, and then the problem.",
