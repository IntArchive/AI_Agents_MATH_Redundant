    "AcceptedAnswer": "Assuming that you know that a monotone, bounded sequence converges, you want to do two things. First, show that $\\langle x_n:n\\in\\mathbb{Z}^+\\rangle$ is monotone and bounded, and then show that its limit is the positive root of $x^2-x-c=0$. If $c=x_1=1$, $x_2=\\sqrt2>x_1$, while if $c=1$ and $x_1=2$, $x_2=\\sqrt3<x_1$, so if the sequence is monotonic, the direction in which it’s monotonic must depend on $c$ and $x_1$. A good first step would be to try to figure out how this dependence works. The positive root of the quadratic is $\\frac12(1+\\sqrt{1+4c})$, which I’ll denote by $r$. If $x_n\\to r$, as claimed, and does so monotonically, it must be the case that the sequence increases monotonically if $x_1<r$ and decreases monotonically if $x_1>r$. In the examples in the last paragraph, $r=\\frac12(1+\\sqrt5)\\approx 1.618$, so they behave as predicted. This suggests that your first step should be to show that if $x_n<r$, then $x_n<x_{n+1}<r$, while if $x_n>r$, $x_n>x_{n+1}>r$; that would be enough to show that $\\langle x_n:n\\in\\mathbb{Z}^+\\rangle$ is both monotone and bounded and hence that it has a limit. Suppose that $0\\le x_n<r$; you can easily check that $x_n^2-x_n-c<0$, i.e., that $x_n^2<x_n+c$. On the other hand, $x_{n+1}^2=c+x_n$, so $x_{n+1}^2>x_n^2$, and therefore $x_{n+1}>x_n$. Is it possible that $x_{n+1}\\ge r$? That would require that $x_{n+1}^2-x_{n+1}-c\\ge 0$ (why?) and hence that $$x_{n+1}^2\\ge x_{n+1}+c>x_n+c=x_{n+1}^2\\;,$$ which is clearly impossible. Thus, if $0\\le x_n<r$, we must have $x_n<x_{n+1}<r$, as desired. I leave the case $x_n>r$ to you. Once this is done, you still have to show that the limit of the sequence really is $r$. Let $f(x)=\\sqrt{c+x}$; clearly $f$ is continuous, so if the sequence converges to $L$, we have $$L=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}x_n=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}x_{n+1}=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f(x_n)=f(L)\\;,$$ and from there it’s trivial to check that $L=r$. Added: Note that although the problem gave us $x_1>0$, this isn’t actually necessary: all that’s needed is that $x_1\\ge -c$, so that $x_2$ is defined, since $x_2=\\sqrt{c+x_1}\\ge 0$ automatically.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The problem is about proving that the sequence defined by x_{n+1} = sqrt(c + x_n) converges monotonically to the solution of the quadratic equation x^2 - x - c = 0, where c > 0 and the initial term x_1 is such that |x_1| < c. Wait, but the note says that answers might assume x_1 > 0, and that x_3 > 0. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify the initial conditions.\n\nFirst, the quadratic equation x^2 - x - c = 0 has a positive root because if we solve it using the quadratic formula, the positive root is [1 + sqrt(1 + 4c)] / 2. Since c > 0, the discriminant is definitely positive, so there are two real roots, one positive and one negative. But the problem specifies x > 0, so we're looking at the positive root. Let's denote this root as L. So L = [1 + sqrt(1 + 4c)] / 2.\n\nNow, the sequence is recursively defined by x_{n+1} = sqrt(c + x_n). The initial term x_1 satisfies |x_1| < c. However, since we're dealing with square roots, which are defined only for non-negative numbers, x_{n} must be such that c + x_n >= 0 for all n. Given that c > 0 and |x_1| < c, so x_1 could be negative, but let's see. If x_1 is negative, then x_2 = sqrt(c + x_1). Since |x_1| < c, c + x_1 > 0, so x_2 is real and positive. Then x_3 = sqrt(c + x_2) which is sqrt(c + a positive number), so x_3 is also positive. Hence, starting from x_2 onwards, all terms are positive. The note mentions that x_3 > 0, which aligns with this.\n\nSo maybe the problem is considering that even if x_1 is negative, the sequence becomes positive from x_2 onwards. But the problem states \"x > 0\" in the quadratic equation, so the solution is positive, and the sequence converges to that positive root.\n\nThe task is to prove that the sequence converges monotonically to L. Now, we need to show two things: convergence and monotonicity. But first, perhaps we need to establish that the sequence is bounded and monotonic, hence convergent by the Monotone Convergence Theorem. Then, once we know it converges, we can show that the limit must satisfy the equation L = sqrt(c + L), which leads to L^2 = c + L, i.e., L^2 - L - c = 0, which is the given quadratic equation. Therefore, the limit L is indeed the positive root.\n\nBut how to show that the sequence is monotonic? It depends on the initial term x_1. Wait, but the problem states \"for c > 0\" and \"|x_1| < c\", and recursively defines x_{n+1} = sqrt(c + x_n). Let's consider different cases for x_1.\n\nCase 1: x_1 is positive. Then, since x_1 < c (because |x_1| < c), x_2 = sqrt(c + x_1). Let's compute x_2. Since x_1 < c, c + x_1 < c + c = 2c, so x_2 = sqrt(c + x_1) < sqrt(2c). But how does this compare to x_1? If x_1 is less than sqrt(c + x_1), then x_2 > x_1. Wait, but maybe not. Let's see. Suppose x_1 is very small, say x_1 = 0. Then x_2 = sqrt(c + 0) = sqrt(c). Then x_3 = sqrt(c + sqrt(c)), etc. So in this case, the sequence is increasing. But wait, if x_1 is less than L, then perhaps the sequence is increasing and bounded above by L, hence converging to L. If x_1 is greater than L, then the sequence would be decreasing. But given that |x_1| < c, and L is [1 + sqrt(1 + 4c)] / 2, we need to check if |x_1| < c implies x_1 < L. Let's see. For example, take c = 2. Then L = [1 + sqrt(1 + 8)] / 2 = [1 + 3]/2 = 2. So L = 2. If |x_1| < 2, then x_1 is between -2 and 2. But x_2 would be sqrt(2 + x_1). If x_1 is, say, 1, then x_2 = sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732, which is less than L=2. Then x_3 = sqrt(2 + sqrt(3)) ≈ sqrt(3.732) ≈ 1.931, which is still less than 2. Then x_4 ≈ sqrt(2 + 1.931) ≈ sqrt(3.931) ≈ 1.982, approaching 2. So here, starting at x_1 = 1 < L, the sequence is increasing towards L.\n\nIf x_1 is greater than L, but according to |x_1| < c, suppose c is 2 again. If L = 2, then x_1 must be less than 2. So maybe in general, L is always greater than or equal to sqrt(c), but perhaps not. Wait, when c is 1, L = [1 + sqrt(5)] / 2 ≈ 1.618, which is greater than sqrt(1) = 1. So in general, L = [1 + sqrt(1 + 4c)] / 2. Let's compare L to sqrt(c). Let's square both: L^2 = ([1 + sqrt(1 + 4c)] / 2)^2 = (1 + 2 sqrt(1 + 4c) + 1 + 4c)/4 = (2 + 4c + 2 sqrt(1 + 4c)) / 4 = (1 + 2c + sqrt(1 + 4c)) / 2. Compare this to c. For c > 0, is L > sqrt(c)?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's not necessary. The key point is whether the initial term is less than L or greater than L. But given that |x_1| < c, and L is the positive root of x^2 - x - c = 0, let's see what L is in terms of c. Solving x^2 = x + c, so x = [1 + sqrt(1 + 4c)] / 2. Let's check if L > c. For c = 1, L ≈ 1.618 > 1. For c = 2, L = 2, which is equal. For c = 3, L = [1 + sqrt(13)] / 2 ≈ (1 + 3.605)/2 ≈ 2.3025 < 3. So when c >= 1, L may be less than c? Wait, for c = 3, L ≈ 2.3025 < 3. So if |x_1| < c, then x_1 could be up to c, but L might be less than c. Wait, but for c = 2, L = 2. So for c > 2, perhaps L < c? Let's check c = 4. Then L = [1 + sqrt(17)] / 2 ≈ (1 + 4.123)/2 ≈ 2.5615 < 4. So yes, for c > 2, L < c. Therefore, if |x_1| < c, then x_1 could be up to c, but L could be less than c. So if x_1 is greater than L, then the sequence would decrease to L. But if x_1 is less than L, it would increase to L. So we need to consider two cases: x_1 < L and x_1 > L. However, the problem states |x_1| < c, but depending on c, L could be less than or greater than c.\n\nWait, when c = 1, L ≈ 1.618 > c =1. When c =2, L=2 =c. When c=3, L≈2.302 <3. So for c <=2, L >=c/2? Not sure. But maybe the key is that regardless of where x_1 starts (as long as |x_1| <c), the sequence will eventually approach L monotonically. Wait, but the problem says \"prove that the sequence {x_n} converges monotonically to the solution\". So perhaps regardless of x_1 (as long as |x_1| <c), the sequence becomes monotonic after some term. For example, if x_1 is negative, then x_2 is positive, and then maybe x_2 is less than L, so the sequence increases from x_2 onwards. If x_1 is positive but less than L, then it increases; if x_1 is positive and greater than L, it decreases. But given that |x_1| < c, and L might be greater or less than c. For example, when c=1, L≈1.618>1, so |x_1| <1 implies x_1 <1 < L, so the sequence would be increasing. When c=3, L≈2.302<3, so |x_1| <3, but x_1 could be greater than L (if x_1 is between 2.302 and 3) or less than L. Wait, but |x_1| <c, which for c=3, x_1 is between -3 and 3. But x_1 has to satisfy that x_2 = sqrt(c + x_1) is real, so c + x_1 >=0, which given |x_1| <c, so x_1 > -c, hence c +x_1 >0. So x_2 is always positive. Then x_3 = sqrt(c + x_2), etc. So if x_1 is negative, x_2 is sqrt(c + x_1). Since x_1 >= -c, x_2 >=0. But if x_1 is negative, c +x_1 <c, so x_2 = sqrt(c +x_1) < sqrt(c). Then x_3 = sqrt(c + x_2) < sqrt(c + sqrt(c)) < sqrt(c + sqrt(c + ... )). Wait, but how does this compare to L?\n\nAlternatively, maybe regardless of the starting x_1 (with |x_1| <c), the sequence becomes increasing or decreasing after the first few terms. For example, if x_1 is negative, then x_2 is positive but maybe less than L, so x_3 = sqrt(c +x_2). If x_2 < L, then x_3 = sqrt(c +x_2) < sqrt(c +L) = L, because L = sqrt(c +L). Wait, because L^2 = c + L. So sqrt(c + L) = L. So if x_n < L, then x_{n+1} = sqrt(c +x_n) < sqrt(c +L) = L. Similarly, if x_n < L, then x_{n+1} = sqrt(c +x_n) < sqrt(c +L) = L. So the sequence is bounded above by L if it starts below L. Similarly, if x_n > L, then x_{n+1} = sqrt(c +x_n) > sqrt(c +L) = L. So the sequence is bounded below by L if it starts above L. So if the initial term x_1 is less than L, then the sequence is increasing and bounded above by L, hence converges to L. If x_1 is greater than L, the sequence is decreasing and bounded below by L, hence converges to L. But we need to consider the initial term's position relative to L.\n\nBut the problem states |x_1| <c. But depending on c, L could be greater than or less than c. For example, when c=1, L≈1.618>1, so |x_1|<1 implies x_1 <1 <L, so the sequence is increasing. When c=3, L≈2.302<3, so |x_1|<3 means x_1 could be between -3 and 3. If x_1 is between -3 and L≈2.302, then x_2 = sqrt(3 +x_1). If x_1 is negative, say x_1 = -2, then x_2 = sqrt(3 + (-2)) = sqrt(1)=1. Then x_3 = sqrt(3 +1)=2, x_4 = sqrt(3+2)=sqrt(5)≈2.236, which is still less than L≈2.302. Then x_5 = sqrt(3 +2.236)=sqrt(5.236)≈2.288, getting closer. x_6≈sqrt(3 +2.288)=sqrt(5.288)≈2.299, x_7≈sqrt(3 +2.299)=sqrt(5.299)≈2.302, which is L. So in this case, starting from x_1=-2 < L, the sequence increases to L. If x_1 is between L and c (for c=3, x_1 between 2.302 and 3), then x_2 = sqrt(3 +x_1). If x_1=2.5, then x_2=sqrt(3 +2.5)=sqrt(5.5)≈2.345>L≈2.302. Then x_3=sqrt(3 +2.345)=sqrt(5.345)≈2.312>L. Then x_4=sqrt(3 +2.312)=sqrt(5.312)≈2.305>L. x_5≈sqrt(5.305)≈2.303>L. x_6≈sqrt(5.303)≈2.3023, which converges to L. So in this case, starting above L, the sequence decreases towards L. However, the problem states |x_1| <c, which in the case c=3, x_1 can be up to 3, but L≈2.302. So if x_1 is between L and c, the sequence decreases to L. Therefore, depending on whether x_1 is less than or greater than L, the sequence is increasing or decreasing. However, the problem says \"converges monotonically\". So the sequence is either non-decreasing or non-increasing after some point. But the problem states \"monotonically\", so we need to show that the entire sequence is monotonic, or eventually becomes monotonic. \n\nBut the note mentions that answers might assume x_1 >0, but they still work because x_3 >0. So even if x_1 is negative, x_2 is positive, and x_3 is positive. So perhaps the sequence is monotonic from x_2 onwards. For example, if x_1 is negative, x_2 is positive, then x_3 = sqrt(c +x_2) > x_2? Let's see. Take c=2, x_1 = -1. Then x_2 = sqrt(2 + (-1)) = sqrt(1)=1. Then x_3 = sqrt(2 +1)=sqrt(3)≈1.732 >1. Then x_4≈sqrt(2 +1.732)≈1.913, and so on, increasing. So here, starting from x_2=1 < L=2, the sequence increases. If x_1 is between L and c, say c=3, x_1=2.5, then x_2=sqrt(3 +2.5)=sqrt(5.5)≈2.345>L≈2.302, then x_3≈sqrt(5.345)≈2.312>L, decreasing. So in both cases, after the first term (if x_1 is negative), the sequence becomes increasing or decreasing accordingly. Therefore, the sequence is monotonic after the second term, but the problem states \"converges monotonically\", so perhaps overall it's considered monotonic from n=1 if we account for the initial terms. However, the exact approach would require checking base cases and using induction.\n\nTo formalize this, perhaps we can split into cases based on the initial term's relation to L. However, the problem doesn't specify x_1's relation to L, just |x_1| <c. But as we've seen, depending on c, L can be greater than or less than c. Wait, no. Let's check for general c >0. Let's compute L in terms of c. L = [1 + sqrt(1 +4c)] /2. Let's compare L to c.\n\nSet L = c. Then:\n\n[1 + sqrt(1 +4c)] /2 = c\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: 1 + sqrt(1 +4c) = 2c\n\nSubtract 1: sqrt(1 +4c) = 2c -1\n\nSquare both sides: 1 +4c = (2c -1)^2 =4c² -4c +1\n\nBring all terms to one side: 1 +4c -4c² +4c -1=0 → 8c -4c²=0 →4c(2 -c)=0\n\nSolutions: c=0 or c=2. Since c>0, the only solution is c=2.\n\nTherefore, when c=2, L=2. For c>2, L <c. For 0 <c <2, L >c.\n\nTherefore, depending on whether c is greater than or less than 2, L is less than or greater than c. So if c >2, then L <c. Therefore, |x_1| <c means x_1 can be up to c, but L is less than c. So x_1 could be greater than L or less than L. For example, c=3, L≈2.302<3. So x_1 can be between -3 and 3. If x_1 is in (L,3), then the sequence decreases to L. If x_1 is in (-3, L), the sequence increases to L.\n\nBut for c <2, say c=1, L≈1.618>1, so |x_1| <1 implies x_1 is between -1 and 1, which is less than L≈1.618. Therefore, in this case, regardless of x_1 (since |x_1| <c=1<L), the sequence is increasing towards L.\n\nFor c=2, L=2, so |x_1| <2. If x_1 is in (-2,2), then x_2 = sqrt(2 +x_1). If x_1 is in (-2,2), then x_2 is in (sqrt(0), sqrt(4))=(0,2). Then x_3 = sqrt(2 +x_2). If x_2 <2, then x_3 = sqrt(2 +x_2) < sqrt(4)=2. So the sequence is increasing if x_n <2, and converges to 2. If x_1=1, then x_2=sqrt(3)≈1.732, x_3≈sqrt(2 +1.732)≈1.913, etc., increasing to 2.\n\nSo in summary:\n\n- If c >=2: L <=c. |x_1| <c. If x_1 <L, sequence increases; if x_1 >L, sequence decreases.\n\n- If c <2: L >c. |x_1| <c <L, so x_1 <L, so sequence increases.\n\nBut the problem states c >0 and |x_1| <c. So when c <2, L >c, so x_1 <c <L implies the sequence is increasing. When c >=2, L <=c, so x_1 could be <L or >L (but still |x_1| <c). Therefore, in the case c >=2, we need to consider both possibilities.\n\nHowever, the problem says \"the sequence converges monotonically\". So regardless of c and x_1 (with |x_1| <c), the sequence is eventually monotonic. But how to structure the proof.\n\nFirst, show that the sequence is bounded. For example, if we can show that all terms are bounded above by L (if increasing) or bounded below by L (if decreasing). Then show that it's monotonic after a certain point.\n\nAlternatively, use induction to show that if x_n < L, then x_{n+1} = sqrt(c +x_n) < sqrt(c +L) = L, so the sequence is bounded above by L. Similarly, if x_n > L, then x_{n+1} = sqrt(c +x_n) > sqrt(c +L) = L, so bounded below by L.\n\nNext, show that the sequence is monotonic. If x_1 < L, then x_2 = sqrt(c +x_1) > x_1? Let's see. Suppose x < L, then sqrt(c +x) >x?\n\nWe need to check if sqrt(c +x) >x when x < L.\n\nSince L satisfies L = sqrt(c +L), so for x < L, sqrt(c +x) > sqrt(c +x') where x' approaches L.\n\nBut wait, let's compare x and sqrt(c +x). Let's set f(x) = sqrt(c +x). We need to see if f(x) >x when x < L.\n\nAt x = L, f(L) = L.\n\nTake derivative: f’(x) = 1/(2 sqrt(c +x)). The function f(x) is increasing because derivative is positive.\n\nConsider the difference f(x) -x. At x=0: f(0)=sqrt(c) >0. At x=L: f(L)-L=0.\n\nCompute derivative of f(x) -x: f’(x) -1 = 1/(2 sqrt(c +x)) -1.\n\nIf f’(x) -1 <0, then f(x) -x is decreasing. Since f(L)-L=0, and f(x) -x is decreasing, then for x <L, f(x) -x >0. Therefore, sqrt(c +x) >x for x <L. Hence, if x_n <L, then x_{n+1} = sqrt(c +x_n) >x_n. Therefore, the sequence is increasing when x_n <L.\n\nSimilarly, if x_n >L, then f(x) = sqrt(c +x) <x. Because f(x) -x is decreasing and f(L)-L=0, so for x >L, f(x)-x <0. Hence, x_{n+1} <x_n, so the sequence is decreasing.\n\nTherefore, once we establish that the sequence is bounded and monotonic, we can apply the Monotone Convergence Theorem.\n\nBut first, let's show that if |x_1| <c, then all terms x_n are bounded. Wait, for c >=2 and x_1 >L, the sequence is decreasing, but since L <c, and |x_1| <c, then x_1 <c. But if x_1 >L, then the sequence decreases to L, which is greater than L but less than c. So the terms are bounded between L and c.\n\nBut how to formalize this.\n\nAlternatively, consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: x_1 <L. Then we show by induction that x_n <L and x_{n+1} >x_n.\n\nBase case: x_1 <L. Then x_2 = sqrt(c +x_1). Since x_1 <L, c +x_1 <c +L. But L^2 =c +L, so c +x_1 <L^2. Therefore, sqrt(c +x_1) <L, so x_2 <L. Also, x_2 = sqrt(c +x_1). We need to check if x_2 >x_1. Since x_1 <L, and f(x)=sqrt(c +x) >x for x <L, as shown earlier. Hence, x_2 >x_1. So the sequence is increasing and bounded above by L, hence converges to L.\n\nCase 2: x_1 >L. Then we show x_n >L and x_{n+1} <x_n. Similarly, by induction. Then the sequence is decreasing and bounded below by L, hence converges to L.\n\nBut the problem states |x_1| <c. However, if c >=2 and x_1 is in (L, c), then the sequence decreases. If x_1 is in (-c, L), it increases. But if x_1 is negative, as in the example earlier, x_2 becomes positive and less than L (if c >=2), or positive and possibly less than L even if c <2. Wait, for c <2, L >c. If x_1 is negative, x_2 = sqrt(c +x_1). Since x_1 >= -c, c +x_1 >=0. So x_2 is between 0 and sqrt(2c). For c <2, sqrt(2c) < sqrt(4)=2. But L for c <2 is greater than c. For example, c=1, L≈1.618. sqrt(2*1)=sqrt(2)≈1.414<L. Therefore, x_2 <L. Hence, even if x_1 is negative, x_2 <L, so the sequence increases from x_2 onwards.\n\nTherefore, regardless of x_1 (as long as |x_1| <c), the sequence becomes increasing after the first term (if x_1 is negative) or is increasing from the start (if x_1 is positive and <L). However, if x_1 >L (possible only when c >=2), then the sequence is decreasing.\n\nBut the problem says \"converges monotonically\", so we need to show that the entire sequence is monotonic. However, if x_1 is negative, then x_2 is positive, and x_2 could be greater than x_1 (since x_1 is negative), but then x_3 = sqrt(c +x_2) >x_2 (if x_2 <L). So in this case, the sequence increases from x_1 to x_2, and then continues increasing. So the entire sequence is not monotonic, but from x_2 onwards it's increasing. However, the problem says \"converges monotonically\", which might allow for eventual monotonicity. But the standard definition of a monotonic sequence requires all terms to be non-decreasing or non-increasing. However, the problem might be using \"monotonically\" in the sense that after some index, it's monotonic. The note mentions that answers might assume x_1 >0, but they still work as x_3 >0. So perhaps the problem allows for the first few terms to adjust, but the sequence becomes monotonic.\n\nBut the problem statement says \"prove that the sequence {x_n} converges monotonically to the solution\", so perhaps we need to show that from some n onward, the sequence is monotonic. However, given the recursive definition, once a term is in (0, L) or (L, ∞), the sequence becomes increasing or decreasing respectively. Given that after x_2, all terms are positive, and depending on whether x_2 is less than or greater than L, the sequence becomes increasing or decreasing.\n\nBut how to handle the initial term x_1. If x_1 is negative, x_2 = sqrt(c +x_1). Since |x_1| <c, x_1 >-c, so c +x_1 >0. Thus, x_2 is positive. Then x_3 = sqrt(c +x_2) >x_2 iff x_2 <L. But if x_2 <L, which is true because x_2 = sqrt(c +x_1). Since x_1 <c, c +x_1 <c +c=2c. So x_2 <sqrt(2c). Compare this to L.\n\nL = [1 + sqrt(1 +4c)] /2. Let's see if sqrt(2c) <=L.\n\nFor c=1: sqrt(2*1)=sqrt(2)≈1.414 < L≈1.618. So yes.\n\nFor c=2: sqrt(4)=2 =L=2.\n\nFor c=3: sqrt(6)≈2.449 <L≈2.302? No, sqrt(6)≈2.449>2.302. Wait, but earlier for c=3, L≈2.302. So sqrt(2c)=sqrt(6)≈2.449>L≈2.302. Therefore, in this case, x_2 = sqrt(c +x_1). If x_1 is negative, c +x_1 <c, so x_2 <sqrt(c). For c=3, sqrt(3)≈1.732 <L≈2.302. Then x_3 = sqrt(3 +1.732)=sqrt(4.732)≈2.175 <L. Then x_4≈sqrt(3 +2.175)=sqrt(5.175)≈2.275 <L. x_5≈sqrt(3 +2.275)=sqrt(5.275)≈2.296 <L. x_6≈sqrt(5.296)=≈2.301, approaching L. So here, even though sqrt(2c)≈2.449>L, but x_2 starts at sqrt(c +x_1) which, when x_1 is negative, is less than sqrt(c), which for c=3 is sqrt(3)≈1.732<L. Therefore, the sequence increases towards L. So in this case, even when c >=2 and x_1 negative, x_2 is less than L, leading to an increasing sequence.\n\nBut if x_1 is positive and greater than L (possible when c >=2), then the sequence decreases. For example, c=3, x_1=3 (but wait, |x_1| <c=3, so x_1 must be <3). Suppose x_1=2.5, then x_2=sqrt(3+2.5)=sqrt(5.5)≈2.345>L≈2.302. Then x_3≈sqrt(3+2.345)=sqrt(5.345)≈2.312>L, then decreasing towards L.\n\nSo to summarize:\n\n- If x_1 <L: sequence is increasing, bounded above by L, converges to L.\n\n- If x_1 >L: sequence is decreasing, bounded below by L, converges to L.\n\nBut given that |x_1| <c:\n\n- For c <2: L >c, so x_1 <c <L, so sequence is increasing.\n\n- For c >=2: L <=c. If x_1 <L, sequence increases; if x_1 >L, sequence decreases. However, since |x_1| <c, and L <=c, x_1 can be in (-c, c). If x_1 is negative, x_2=sqrt(c +x_1) <sqrt(c +c)=sqrt(2c). But for c >=2, sqrt(2c) >=sqrt(4)=2. For example, c=3: sqrt(6)≈2.449. L≈2.302. So x_2=sqrt(3 +x_1). If x_1 is negative, say x_1=-2, then x_2=sqrt(1)=1 <L≈2.302. So the sequence increases. If x_1 is positive and in (L, c), then the sequence decreases.\n\nBut how to handle this in the proof. Perhaps split into cases based on the value of c.\n\nBut the problem doesn't differentiate between c <2 and c >=2. It just says c >0. So perhaps we need a more general approach.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that regardless of x_1 (as long as |x_1| <c), the sequence will eventually become increasing or decreasing based on its relation to L. But to show monotonicity, we can consider the behavior after the first term.\n\nIf x_1 is negative, then x_2 is positive. Then compare x_2 to L. Since x_1 <c, x_2 = sqrt(c +x_1) <sqrt(c +c) =sqrt(2c). But we need to compare sqrt(2c) to L. Let's compute:\n\nL = [1 + sqrt(1 +4c)] /2.\n\nCompare sqrt(2c) and L.\n\nLet’s square both:\n\nL² = ([1 + sqrt(1 +4c)] /2)² = (1 + 2 sqrt(1 +4c) +1 +4c)/4 = (2 +4c +2 sqrt(1 +4c))/4 = (1 +2c + sqrt(1 +4c))/2.\n\nCompare to 2c:\n\nL² vs 2c:\n\n(1 +2c + sqrt(1 +4c))/2 vs 2c\n\nMultiply both by 2:\n\n1 +2c + sqrt(1 +4c) vs 4c\n\nSubtract 2c:\n\n1 + sqrt(1 +4c) vs 2c\n\nSo when is 1 + sqrt(1 +4c) <= 2c?\n\nLet’s set t = sqrt(1 +4c). Then t = sqrt(1 +4c) => t² =1 +4c => c=(t² -1)/4.\n\nThe inequality becomes 1 + t <= 2*( (t² -1)/4 )*2 ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, 2c =2*( (t² -1)/4 ) = (t² -1)/2.\n\nSo the inequality is 1 + t <= (t² -1)/2 ?\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n2 + 2t <= t² -1\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\nt² -2t -3 >=0\n\nFactor:\n\n(t -3)(t +1) >=0\n\nSince t = sqrt(1 +4c) >=1 (since c>0), t >=1. So the inequality holds when t >=3, i.e., sqrt(1 +4c) >=3 => 1 +4c >=9 =>4c >=8 =>c >=2.\n\nTherefore, for c >=2, 1 + sqrt(1 +4c) <=2c. Hence, L² <=2c.\n\nTherefore, for c >=2, sqrt(2c) >=L.\n\nBut wait, when c=2, L=2, sqrt(2c)=sqrt(4)=2=L. So equality holds.\n\nFor c >2, sqrt(2c) >L.\n\nTherefore, for c >=2, x_2=sqrt(c +x_1) <=sqrt(c +c)=sqrt(2c)>=L.\n\nBut if x_1 is negative, then x_2=sqrt(c +x_1) <sqrt(c). For c >=2, sqrt(c) <=sqrt(2c). But since L <=sqrt(2c), but sqrt(c) could be less than or greater than L.\n\nWait, for c=3: sqrt(c)=sqrt(3)≈1.732 <L≈2.302.\n\nWait, but sqrt(2c)=sqrt(6)≈2.449>L≈2.302.\n\nSo for c=3, x_2=sqrt(3 +x_1). If x_1 is negative, say x_1=-2, then x_2=sqrt(1)=1 <L. If x_1=2.5 (positive, <3), x_2=sqrt(5.5)≈2.345>L≈2.302.\n\nTherefore, for c >=2:\n\n- If x_1 is negative: x_2 <sqrt(c) <L (since c=3, sqrt(3)≈1.732 <2.302). Then the sequence increases.\n\n- If x_1 is positive and <L: x_2=sqrt(c +x_1) <sqrt(c +L)=L, so the sequence increases.\n\n- If x_1 is positive and >L: x_2=sqrt(c +x_1) <x_1 (since x_1 >L and f(x)=sqrt(c +x) <x for x >L), so the sequence decreases.\n\nTherefore, in all cases, the sequence becomes monotonic (increasing or decreasing) after the first term, depending on x_1's relation to L. However, when c >=2 and x_1 is in (L, c), the sequence decreases; otherwise, it increases.\n\nBut the problem states that the sequence converges monotonically, so we need to show that regardless of the initial x_1 (with |x_1| <c), the sequence is eventually monotonic. The key is to show that after possibly the second term, the sequence is either non-decreasing or non-increasing.\n\nTo structure the proof:\n\n1. Show that the limit L exists and is the positive root of x^2 -x -c =0.\n\n2. Show that if the sequence converges, it must converge to L.\n\n3. Show that the sequence is bounded and monotonic, hence converges.\n\nFor boundedness:\n\n- If x_n <L, then x_{n+1}=sqrt(c +x_n) <sqrt(c +L)=L.\n\n- If x_n >L, then x_{n+1}=sqrt(c +x_n) >sqrt(c +L)=L.\n\nSo the sequence is bounded above by max{x_1, L} or below by min{x_1, L}.\n\nFor monotonicity:\n\n- If x_n <L, then x_{n+1}=sqrt(c +x_n) >x_n.\n\n- If x_n >L, then x_{n+1}=sqrt(c +x_n) <x_n.\n\nTherefore, once a term is on one side of L, the sequence moves monotonically towards L.\n\nBut we need to ensure that after some term, the sequence is on one side of L. For example, even if x_1 is negative, x_2 is positive. Need to check if x_2 is less than or greater than L.\n\nGiven that x_2=sqrt(c +x_1). Since |x_1| <c, x_1 >-c, so c +x_1 >0. Thus, x_2=sqrt(c +x_1).\n\nIf x_1 <L:\n\n- If c <2: L >c, x_1 <c <L, so x_2=sqrt(c +x_1) <sqrt(c +c)=sqrt(2c). For c <2, sqrt(2c) <L (since L=(1+sqrt(1+4c))/2). For example, c=1: sqrt(2)=1.414 <1.618. Therefore, x_2 <L.\n\n- If c >=2: x_2=sqrt(c +x_1). If x_1 <L, then c +x_1 <c +L. But L^2 =c +L, so c +x_1 <L^2. Hence, x_2=sqrt(c +x_1) <L. Therefore, x_2 <L.\n\nTherefore, if x_1 <L, then x_2 <L, and by induction, all subsequent terms are <L, hence the sequence is increasing.\n\nIf x_1 >L (possible only when c >=2), then x_2=sqrt(c +x_1) <x_1 (since x_1 >L, and f(x)=sqrt(c +x) <x for x >L). Then x_2 <x_1, but need to check if x_2 >L. Since x_1 >L, c +x_1 >c +L =L^2. Therefore, x_2=sqrt(c +x_1) >L. Hence, x_2 is in (L, x_1). Therefore, the sequence decreases and remains >L, hence converges to L.\n\nTherefore, in all cases, after the first term (if x_1 <L) or immediately (if x_1 >L), the sequence is monotonic and bounded, hence convergent. If x_1 is negative, x_2 is positive and <L, so the sequence increases from x_2 onwards.\n\nThus, the proof structure would be:\n\n1. Show that the sequence is bounded.\n\n2. Show that the sequence is eventually monotonic.\n\n3. Apply the Monotone Convergence Theorem to establish convergence.\n\n4. Show that the limit must satisfy L^2 =c +L, hence L is the positive root.\n\nTherefore, the answer should list the assumptions and the problem accordingly.
