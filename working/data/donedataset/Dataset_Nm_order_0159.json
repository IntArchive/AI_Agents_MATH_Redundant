    "AcceptedAnswer": "As mentioned by yoyo: if $H\\subset S_n$ is of index 2 then it is normal and $S_n/H$ is isomorphic to $C_2=\\{1,-1\\}$. We thus have a surjective homomorphism $f:S_n\\to C_2$ with kernel $H$. All transpositions in $S_n$ are conjugate, hence $f(t)\\in C_2$ is the same element for every transposition $t\\in S_n$ (this uses the fact that $C_2$ is commutative). $S_n$ is generated by transpositions, therefore $C_2$ is generated by $f(t)$ (for any transposition $t\\in S_n$), therefore $f(t)=-1$, therefore ker $f=A_n$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should list each condition on one line, applied to one object. The problem is then stated clearly.\n\nThe original problem here is from Math Stack Exchange: \"Prove that the only subgroup of the symmetric group S_n of index 2 is A_n. Why isn't there any other possibility?\"\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The symmetric group S_n is given. The subgroup in question has index 2 in S_n. The problem is to show that the only such subgroup is the alternating group A_n. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- S_n is the symmetric group on n elements.\n- There exists a subgroup of S_n with index 2.\n- A_n is a subgroup of S_n.\n\nWait, but the problem states that A_n is the only such subgroup. So maybe the assumptions should include that A_n is a subgroup of index 2, and the problem is to prove that there are no others. Let me check the example again. In the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7, leading to the problem statement about divisibility by 91. Here, the key elements are S_n, subgroup of index 2, and uniqueness of A_n.\n\nSo, the assumptions should list the properties of S_n, the existence of a subgroup of index 2, and perhaps that A_n is a subgroup. Wait, maybe the problem is more about uniqueness. The user's example had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in the problem here, the key points are:\n\n1. S_n is the symmetric group.\n2. A subgroup H of S_n has index 2.\n3. The task is to prove that H must be A_n.\n\nBut how to list the assumptions? The problem is to show that the only subgroup of S_n with index 2 is A_n. So the main assumption is that H is a subgroup of S_n with index 2. Then the problem is to show H = A_n.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption was on n (integer and divisible by 7). Here, the assumptions would be about the group and the subgroup. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- S_n is the symmetric group on n elements.\n- H is a subgroup of S_n.\n- The index of H in S_n is 2.\nProblem: Prove that H must be equal to A_n.\n\nBut wait, the problem is phrased as \"the only subgroup of S_n of index 2 is A_n\". So the problem is to show that if a subgroup H has index 2, then H is A_n. Therefore, the assumptions would be that H is a subgroup of S_n with index 2. Then the problem is to prove H = A_n.\n\nBut in the example, the assumption included that n is divisible by 7. Here, perhaps the assumption is just that H is a subgroup of S_n with index 2. But the symmetric group S_n is given. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n- G is the symmetric group S_n,\n- H is a subgroup of G,\n- The index of H in G is 2.\n\nProblem: Prove that H is equal to the alternating group A_n.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is more about S_n's structure. Let me check the original question again: \"How to prove that the only subgroup of the symmetric group S_n of index 2 is A_n? Why isn't there other possibility?\" So the key points are S_n has a subgroup of index 2, and that subgroup must be A_n. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- H is a subgroup of the symmetric group S_n,\n- The index of H in S_n is 2.\n\nProblem: Prove that H is equal to A_n.\n\nBut S_n is the symmetric group, which is a given. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- Consider the symmetric group S_n,\n- H is a subgroup of S_n with index 2.\n\nProblem: Prove that H must be the alternating group A_n.\n\nYes, that seems right. Each assumption is one line, applied to one object. First line defines S_n, second defines H's properties. Then the problem is to show H = A_n. The example given had two assumptions about n, here we have two about S_n and H. So that should fit.",
