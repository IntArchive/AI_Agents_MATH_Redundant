    "Content": "I bumped into this question: Question: Prove that for $x\\in \\Bigl[0,\\dfrac {\\pi}{4}\\Bigr]$, $$\\sin (\\tan x) \\geq {x}$$ This seems to be an innocent inequality but I am already exhausted trying to prove it. I followed different lines of thought and mention $3$ of them below: $1.$ I tried using $\\sin x<x<\\tan x$. Knowing that $\\sin x$,$\\tan x$ increase in the mentioned interval, I tried applying $\\tan$ and $\\sin$ on different sides of $\\sin x<x<\\tan x$ in order to achieve something like that in the question.. But I just could not come to the inequality in the question. $2.$ I tried using the function $f(x)=\\sin(\\tan x)-x$. $f(0)=0$. If we prove that the derivative $f'(x)=(\\sec ^2 x)(\\cos(\\tan x))-1$ is positive, then we will be done. But proving even this seems very difficult. $3.$ Since $\\arcsin x$ is one-one and increasing in the mentioned interval, we can take $\\arcsin$ on both sides of the inequality $\\sin (\\tan x) \\geq {x}$ to get $\\tan x > \\arcsin x$. Thus proving  $\\tan x > \\arcsin x$ would be equivalent to solving the problem. All the three approaches are seeming impossible.. Any suggestions or other methods? Thanks..",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "From $(2)$ it boils down to show that $\\cos(\\tan(x)) \\geq \\cos^{2}(x)$. And note that $\\cos(x) > 1-\\dfrac{1}{2}x^{2}$ which gives that $\\cos(\\tan(x)) \\geq 1-\\frac{1}{2}\\tan^{2}(x)$. Now it suffices for us to show $$1-\\frac{1}{2}\\tan^{2}(x) \n\\geq \\cos^{2}(x) \\qquad \\forall \\ x \\in [0,\\frac{\\pi}{4}]$$ This can be re-written as $$2\\cos^{4}(x) - 3 \\cos^{2}(x) + 1 \\leq 0$$ or $$(2\\cos^2x -1)(\\cos^2x-1)\\leq0$$ which actually holds for all $x \\in \\Bigl[0,\\dfrac{\\pi}{4}\\Bigr]$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The problem is to prove that for x in the interval [0, π/4], sin(tan x) is greater than or equal to x. Hmm, interesting. Let me first make sure I understand the question correctly. We need to show that when x is between 0 and π/4 (which is 45 degrees), the value of sin(tan x) is at least as big as x itself. \n\nSo, first, let me note the interval: x is from 0 to π/4. That's important because both tan x and sin(tan x) behave differently depending on the interval. For x in [0, π/4), tan x is increasing, and since x is less than π/4, tan x will go from 0 up to tan(π/4) which is 1. Wait, tan(π/4) is 1, right? So when x approaches π/4, tan x approaches 1. Therefore, the argument inside the sine function, tan x, ranges from 0 to 1. \n\nNow, sin(y) for y between 0 and 1 (since y = tan x here) is also increasing because the derivative of sin(y) is cos(y), which is positive in [0, 1]. So sin(tan x) is a composition of two increasing functions, which means it's increasing on [0, π/4]. Therefore, sin(tan x) starts at 0 when x=0 (since sin(tan 0) = sin(0) = 0) and goes up to sin(1) when x approaches π/4. \n\nOn the other hand, x itself is also increasing from 0 to π/4. The question is whether sin(tan x) is always above x in this interval. At x=0, both are 0. At x=π/4, sin(tan(π/4)) = sin(1) ≈ 0.8415, and π/4 ≈ 0.7854. So sin(1) is greater than π/4, which suggests that at the upper end, sin(tan x) is indeed larger. But we need to ensure that this holds for all x in between.\n\nThe user mentioned three approaches. Let me try to think through each of them and see if I can figure out a way to proceed.\n\nFirst approach: Using the inequalities sin x < x < tan x. Since these are standard inequalities for x in (0, π/2), maybe manipulating them to get something useful. The user tried applying tan and sin to different sides but didn't get the desired result. Let's see. If we know that sin x < x < tan x, can we relate tan x and sin(tan x)? For example, since x < tan x, then applying sin to both sides would give sin x < sin(tan x). But that would be sin x < sin(tan x), but we need to compare sin(tan x) with x. Hmm, not directly helpful. Alternatively, if we take the original inequality x < tan x and apply sin to both sides, we get sin x < sin(tan x). But since x is in [0, π/4], sin x is less than x here (since sin x < x for x > 0). Wait, but x is in [0, π/4], so sin x < x < tan x. If we have sin x < x, and we have sin x < sin(tan x), but that doesn't directly connect x and sin(tan x). Maybe this approach isn't straightforward.\n\nSecond approach: Define f(x) = sin(tan x) - x. Then f(0) = 0. If we can show that f'(x) is non-negative in [0, π/4], then f(x) would be increasing, so f(x) ≥ f(0) = 0 for all x in the interval. Let's compute f'(x). The derivative of sin(tan x) is cos(tan x) * sec²x (by chain rule: derivative of sin(u) is cos(u)*u', and derivative of tan x is sec²x). Then subtract the derivative of x, which is 1. So f'(x) = cos(tan x) * sec²x - 1. We need to show that this is ≥ 0 for all x in [0, π/4].\n\nSo, can we prove that cos(tan x) * sec²x ≥ 1 for x in [0, π/4]? Let's see. Let's substitute y = tan x, so y ranges from 0 to 1 as x goes from 0 to π/4. Then sec²x = 1 + tan²x = 1 + y². So the expression becomes cos(y) * (1 + y²) ≥ 1. So we need to show that for y in [0, 1], cos(y) * (1 + y²) ≥ 1. If this is true, then f'(x) ≥ 0 and hence f(x) is increasing, which would prove the result.\n\nLet me check for y=0: cos(0)*(1+0) = 1*1=1, which equals 1. For y=1: cos(1)*(1+1)=cos(1)*2 ≈ 0.5403*2 ≈ 1.0806, which is greater than 1. So at least at the endpoints, the inequality holds. What about in between? Let's check y=0.5: cos(0.5) ≈ 0.87758, and 1 + (0.5)^2 = 1.25. Multiplying them gives 0.87758 * 1.25 ≈ 1.09698, which is greater than 1. Hmm, seems like it's true at y=0.5. Maybe it's always greater than 1 in [0,1]. Let's see. Let's define g(y) = cos(y)(1 + y²) - 1. We need to show that g(y) ≥ 0 for y ∈ [0,1].\n\nCompute g'(y) = -sin(y)(1 + y²) + cos(y)(2y). Let's see if g(y) is increasing or decreasing. At y=0, g'(0) = -0*(1) + 1*0 = 0. For y in (0,1), is g'(y) positive or negative? Let's compute at y=0.5: g'(0.5) = -sin(0.5)(1 + 0.25) + cos(0.5)(1) ≈ -0.4794*1.25 + 0.87758*1 ≈ -0.59925 + 0.87758 ≈ 0.27833, which is positive. So derivative is positive at 0.5. At y=1: g'(1) = -sin(1)(2) + cos(1)(2) ≈ -0.8415*2 + 0.5403*2 ≈ (-1.683) + 1.0806 ≈ -0.6024, which is negative. So g(y) increases from y=0 to some point and then decreases. Wait, but since at y=0.5, derivative is positive, and at y=1, derivative is negative, there's a maximum somewhere in between. But since at y=0, g(0)=0, and at y=1, g(1)=0.0806, which is positive, and in between, like at y=0.5, it's 1.09698 -1 = 0.09698, which is positive. So maybe g(y) is always ≥0 in [0,1]. Wait, but how do we confirm that? Let's check if there's any minimum in between. Since the derivative starts at 0, becomes positive, then becomes negative. So the function g(y) starts at 0, increases to a maximum, then decreases, but since at y=1 it's still positive, maybe it never dips below 0. To confirm, check if the minimum value is above zero. Alternatively, perhaps use Taylor series or inequalities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe expand cos(y) as a Taylor series: cos(y) = 1 - y²/2 + y^4/24 - ... Then multiply by (1 + y²):\n\ncos(y)(1 + y²) ≈ (1 - y²/2 + y^4/24)(1 + y²) = 1 + y² - y²/2 - y^4/2 + y^4/24 + higher terms.\n\nSimplify: 1 + (y² - y²/2) + (- y^4/2 + y^4/24) = 1 + y²/2 - (12y^4/24 - y^4/24) = 1 + y²/2 - 11y^4/24.\n\nSo up to the fourth order, it's 1 + y²/2 - 11y^4/24. Then subtract 1, we get y²/2 - 11y^4/24. For y in [0,1], this is positive? Let's see at y=1: 1/2 - 11/24 = 12/24 - 11/24 = 1/24 ≈ 0.0417, positive. At y=0.5: (0.25)/2 - 11*(0.0625)/24 ≈ 0.125 - 0.6875/24 ≈ 0.125 - 0.0286 ≈ 0.0964, positive. So the quadratic term dominates the quartic term, so maybe the approximation suggests positivity. However, this is only up to the fourth order. But since higher terms are alternating and decreasing (since it's an alternating series for cos(y)), maybe the remainder is small. But this approach is a bit hand-wavy. Perhaps a better way is to consider the function g(y) = cos(y)(1 + y²) - 1 and check its minimum.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the fact that for y in [0,1], cos(y) ≥ 1 - y²/2 (from the Taylor series with remainder). Let's check if (1 - y²/2)(1 + y²) ≥ 1. Expanding this gives (1)(1 + y²) - (y²/2)(1 + y²) = 1 + y² - y²/2 - y^4/2 = 1 + y²/2 - y^4/2. Then subtract 1: y²/2 - y^4/2 = (y²/2)(1 - y²). Since y ∈ [0,1], 1 - y² ≥ 0, so this is non-negative. Therefore, (1 - y²/2)(1 + y²) ≥ 1. But since cos(y) ≥ 1 - y²/2, then cos(y)(1 + y²) ≥ (1 - y²/2)(1 + y²) ≥ 1. Therefore, g(y) = cos(y)(1 + y²) - 1 ≥ 0. Hence, f'(x) ≥ 0, so f(x) is increasing on [0, π/4]. Since f(0) = 0, then f(x) ≥ 0 for all x in [0, π/4], which proves the inequality. \n\nTherefore, the second approach works by showing the derivative is non-negative, hence the function is increasing, maintaining the inequality from the starting point of 0.\n\nAlternatively, the third approach suggests using arcsin. Since arcsin is increasing, taking arcsin of both sides would give tan x ≥ arcsin x. But proving tan x ≥ arcsin x in [0, π/4]. Let's see, at x=0, both are 0. At x=π/4, tan(π/4)=1, and arcsin(π/4) ≈ arcsin(0.7854) ≈ 0.906 radians (since sin(0.906) ≈ 0.785). So 1 ≥ 0.906, which holds. But need to show tan x ≥ arcsin x for all x in [0, π/4]. Maybe by comparing derivatives. Let h(x) = tan x - arcsin x. Then h(0)=0. Compute h'(x) = sec²x - 1/√(1 - x²). We need to check if h'(x) ≥ 0. For x in [0, π/4], sec²x = 1 + tan²x ≥ 1 + x² (since tan x ≥ x). So sec²x ≥ 1 + x². On the other hand, 1/√(1 - x²) can be expanded as 1 + x²/2 + (3x^4)/8 + ... for |x| <1. So 1/√(1 - x²) ≈ 1 + x²/2 + higher terms. So sec²x is approximately 1 + x² + x^4/3 + ..., which is larger than 1 + x²/2. Therefore, sec²x - 1/√(1 - x²) ≥ (1 + x²) - (1 + x²/2 + ...) ≈ x²/2 - ... which might be positive for small x. Let's check at x=0.5 (radians?), wait x is in [0, π/4] ≈ [0,0.785]. Let's take x=0.5. Then sec²(0.5) = 1 + tan²(0.5). tan(0.5) ≈ 0.5463, so tan² ≈ 0.298, so sec² ≈ 1.298. 1/√(1 - 0.25) = 1/√(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So sec²x - 1/√(1 - x²) ≈ 1.298 - 1.1547 ≈ 0.1433, positive. At x=0.7, sec²(0.7) = 1 + tan²(0.7). tan(0.7) ≈ 0.8423, so tan²≈0.709, sec²≈1.709. 1/√(1 - 0.49) = 1/√(0.51)≈1.402. So 1.709 -1.402≈0.307, still positive. At x approaching π/4≈0.785, tan x approaches 1, so sec²x approaches 2. 1/√(1 - x²) at x=0.785: x²≈0.616, so 1 - x²≈0.384, sqrt≈0.62, so 1/0.62≈1.612. Then sec²x -1/√(1 - x²)≈2 -1.612≈0.388, positive. So h'(x) is positive throughout the interval, meaning h(x) is increasing. Since h(0)=0, then h(x)≥0 for all x in [0, π/4], so tan x ≥ arcsin x, which implies sin(tan x) ≥ x. Hence, the third approach also works by showing tan x ≥ arcsin x, which after applying sin to both sides (since sin is increasing here) gives sin(tan x) ≥ sin(arcsin x) = x.\n\nSo both the second and third approaches can work. The user might have found it difficult to compute the derivatives or to see the inequalities, but with proper analysis, both methods lead to the solution.\n\nTherefore, the key steps are either analyzing the derivative of f(x)=sin(tan x)-x and showing it's non-negative, or transforming the inequality to tan x ≥ arcsin x and proving that by comparing derivatives.",
