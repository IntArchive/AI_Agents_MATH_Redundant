    "AcceptedAnswer": "This one is deceptively simple. Differentiate with respect to $\\alpha$ and note that your integrand becomes $\\dfrac{\\Gamma'(x+\\alpha)}{\\Gamma(x+\\alpha)} $. You can view this also as $(\\log\\Gamma(x+\\alpha))'$ (where the derivative is taken with respect to $x$ now). At this point you have $$\\begin{align}\\int_0^1(\\log\\Gamma(x+\\alpha))'dx &= \\log\\Gamma(x+\\alpha)\\bigg|_0^1 \\\\ &= \\log\\Gamma(1+\\alpha)-\\log\\Gamma(0+\\alpha) \\\\ &= \\log(\\alpha\\Gamma(\\alpha))-\\log\\Gamma(\\alpha) \\\\ &= \\log\\alpha+\\log\\Gamma(\\alpha)-\\log\\Gamma(\\alpha) \\\\ &=\\log\\alpha \\end{align}$$ So $I'(\\alpha) = \\log(\\alpha)$ which gives that $I(\\alpha) = \\alpha\\log\\alpha-\\alpha+C$. To determine the constant of integration, take $\\alpha = 0$. This gives $$I(0) = C = \\int_0^1\\log\\Gamma(x)dx.$$ From here, refer to achille's answer on a different question to evaluate this integral.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original problem is about proving an integral involving the logarithm of the Gamma function. Let me start by identifying the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nFirst, the problem is to prove that the integral from 0 to 1 of log(Γ(x + α)) dx equals (log(2π)/2) + α log α - α, where α is greater than or equal to 0. \n\nNow, looking at the assumptions. The user mentioned in the problem that α is ≥ 0. So that's one assumption. Are there any other implicit assumptions here? The integral is from 0 to 1, and x is the variable of integration. But since the problem is stated in general for α ≥ 0, I think the main assumption is just that α is a non-negative real number. The Gamma function is defined for positive real numbers and complex numbers except non-positive integers, but since x is between 0 and 1, and α ≥ 0, x + α would be ≥ 0. However, if α is 0, then x + α would be between 0 and 1, but Γ is defined at 1 (since Γ(1) = 1), and approaches infinity as x approaches 0. But the logarithm of Γ might still be integrable over [0,1] even if Γ approaches infinity at 0. Wait, but the original problem states α ≥ 0, so maybe when α is 0, x + α is in [0,1], but Γ(0) is undefined. Hmm, but maybe the integral is still convergent? The user didn't specify any further constraints, so perhaps the assumption is just α ≥ 0, and the problem is valid under that condition.\n\nWait, the original question doesn't mention any restrictions on α beyond being ≥ 0. So maybe the key assumption is α ≥ 0. The problem statement in the user's example included assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" when applicable. Here, the only explicit condition given is α ≥ 0. Are there any other objects or conditions? The variable x is integrated from 0 to 1, but that's part of the problem statement, not an assumption. The Gamma function is used, but its properties (like the reflection formula or integral representation) are mentioned as possible methods, but those aren't assumptions of the problem itself. So the main assumption is α is a non-negative real number.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should list each condition. The user's example had each assumption on a separate line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Here, the only condition is α ≥ 0. So the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nα is a non-negative real number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that\n$$\nI:=\\int_0^1 \\log\\left(\\,\\Gamma\\left(x+\\alpha\\right)\\,\\right)\\,{\\rm d}x\n=\\frac{\\log\\left(2\\pi\\right)}{2}+\\alpha \\log\\left(\\alpha\\right) -\\alpha.\n$$\n\nWait, the original problem statement includes \"I am not sure whether to use an integral representation or to somehow use the Euler reflection formula...\" but those are the user's thoughts, not part of the problem's assumptions. So the answer should filter out those and just present the structured problem as per the format.",
