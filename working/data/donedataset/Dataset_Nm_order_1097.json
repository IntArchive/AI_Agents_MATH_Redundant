    "Content": "I am looking into knot theory and have found two different definitions stating that two knots $K_1$ and $K_2$ are equivalent, namely the concept of an ambient isotopy: These two knots are ambient isotopic if there is an isotopy $h:\\mathbb{R}^3 \\times [0,1]\\to \\mathbb{R}^3$ such that $h(K_1,0)=K_1$ and $h(K_1,1)=K_2$. Or the other definition takes a homeomorphism $g:\\mathbb{R}^3\\to\\mathbb{R}^3$ that maps $K_1$ to $K_2$ (ie. $h(K_1) = K_2$). I guess these definitions are not identical and I suppose this has something to do with orientations of your knots. However I find it a bit hard to get my head around it. So I hoped someone could either prove I'm right by giving a counterexample or prove I'm wrong (ie. prove these concept are identical)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I'll be working in $S^3$ for this answer, as it is generally the more convenient place to do knot theory. It does not cause problems: just extend your homeomorphisms to be homeomorphisms of $S^3$, for instance. These are not identical, but they almost are. In particular, the reverse of a knot need not be isotopic to it, but you can just reflect along a hyperplane to get a homeomorphism. But if you replace \"homeomorphism\" with \"orientation-preserving homeomorphism\", they are equivalent. This is because every orientation-preserving homeomorphism of $S^3$ is isotopic to the identity! This follows from a combination of Alexander's trick and the isotopy extension theorem . If you want to do knot theory in the smooth category, working with smooth isotopies instead of continuous isotopies, you need to know that every orientation-preserving diffeomorphism is isotopic to the identity; I think Cerf was the first to prove this. There is one other common definition of equivalence for knots: isotopy of embeddings. A knot is an embedding $S^1 \\to S^3$. An isotopy between two embeddings $f_0, f_1$ is a map $f_t: S^1 \\times [0,1] \\to S^3$ such that each $f_t$ is an embedding. This turns out to not be the correct notion of equivalence for knots - it would force all tame knots to be equivalent! What one does to fix this is either demand that the isotopy be smooth, or that it be locally flat. (See this page again for details on being locally flat.) Now this is precisely the hypothesis we need to use the isotopy extension theorem: so any (locally flat/smooth) isotopy of embeddings automatically lifts to an ambient isotopy, giving us something equivalent to the standard definition. EDIT: I was having some trouble reconstructing the argument I suggested above to show that $\\pi_0 \\text{Homeo}^+(S^3)$ is trivial. So I'll write an argument here. Actually I'll show that $\\pi_0 \\text{Homeo}^+(S^n) = 0$ for all $n$. This is trivial for $n=0$. Inductively assume it's trivial for $n-1$. Pick an orientation-preserving homeomorphism $f$; $f(S^{n-1})$ bounds a ball on both sides. Isotope $f$ so that $f(S^{n-1})$ does not include the poles. Pick a standard 'longitude sphere' $S^{n-1}$s (the level sets of the height function of $S^n \\subset \\mathbb R^{n+1}$) that lie inside one of the balls that $f(S^{n-1})$ bounds (this is possible by compactness of $S^{n-1}$ and continuity of the height function). By the annulus theorem there is a locally flat isotopy of embeddings from $f(S^{n-1})$ to this longitude sphere; then there is an isotopy from this longitude sphere to the equator $S^{n-1}$. Using the isotopy extension theorem $f$ then is isotopic to an orientation-preserving homeomorphism that preserves the equator; we can also assume that it sends the north hemisphere to the north hemisphere. This new $f'$ restricts to an orientation-preserving map on $S^{n-1}$; this restriction is isotopic to the identity; use isotopy extension. So $f'$ is isotopic to $f''$ that preserves $S^{n-1}$ pointwise. $f''$ is the union of two homeomorphisms of $D^n$ (the northern and southern hemispheres), identity on the boundary, along their boundary; the Alexander trick shows that these are isotopic to the identity. So we have produced an isotopy of $f$ to the identity as desired. In the case we care about - $n=3$ - the only hard result we used is the annulus theorem in dimension 3, which is reasonably elementary.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so the user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure this Math Stack Exchange question into their specified format. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe original question is about the equivalence of two definitions of knot equivalence: ambient isotopy and homeomorphism. The user is confused whether these definitions are identical or not, suspecting they might not be due to orientation issues, but isn't sure. They want either a counterexample showing they're different or a proof they're the same.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. The example given had assumptions listed line by line, each about one property or condition applied to one object. Let's parse the original question.\n\nThe two definitions mentioned are:\n\n1. Ambient isotopy: There exists an isotopy h: R^3 × [0,1] → R^3 such that h(K1, 0) = K1 and h(K1, 1) = K2.\n2. Homeomorphism: There exists a homeomorphism g: R^3 → R^3 with g(K1) = K2.\n\nThe user is asking if these definitions are equivalent. So the problem is to determine if these two definitions are equivalent.\n\nNow, the assumptions. The problem mentions two knots K1 and K2. The definitions apply to them. The key points here are:\n\n- K1 and K2 are knots (so they are embeddings of S^1 into R^3).\n- The first definition requires an ambient isotopy.\n- The second definition requires a homeomorphism of R^3 mapping K1 to K2.\n\nWait, but in knot theory, typically equivalence is defined via ambient isotopy, and another common definition is via orientation-preserving homeomorphism. However, the user hasn't specified orientation here. The question says \"homeomorphism\", which could be orientation-preserving or not. The user's confusion might stem from whether the homeomorphism is required to preserve orientation or not.\n\nWait, the original problem states the homeomorphism definition as \"a homeomorphism g: R^3 → R^3 that maps K1 to K2\". There's no mention of orientation. However, in standard knot theory, equivalence is usually considered up to orientation-preserving homeomorphism. If the homeomorphism in the problem is allowed to reverse orientation, that might lead to different equivalence classes. For example, a knot and its mirror image might be considered equivalent under a homeomorphism that reverses orientation but not equivalent under ambient isotopy (which is typically orientation-preserving).\n\nBut let me check. The problem says \"homeomorphism\" without specifying orientation. So the user is comparing ambient isotopy (which is a path of homeomorphisms from the identity to the final map, preserving orientation throughout) versus a single homeomorphism that might reverse orientation. So the key difference is whether the homeomorphism is orientation-preserving or not.\n\nBut in standard definitions, ambient isotopy leads to orientation-preserving homeomorphisms. So if two knots are ambient isotopic, then there exists an orientation-preserving homeomorphism taking one to the other. Conversely, if there's an orientation-preserving homeomorphism, then they are ambient isotopic? I think the answer depends on whether the homeomorphism is isotopic to the identity. But in R^3, any orientation-preserving homeomorphism is isotopic to the identity? Not sure. Wait, in R^3, the group of homeomorphisms is quite flexible. I think that for compactly supported homeomorphisms, they can be isotopic to the identity. But maybe not in general. Hmm.\n\nBut the user's problem is whether the two definitions (ambient isotopy vs. existence of any homeomorphism, regardless of isotopy) are equivalent. The classic example is that a knot and its mirror image may not be ambient isotopic (if the knot is chiral) but there exists a homeomorphism of R^3 (reflection) that maps one to the other. So in that case, the two definitions are not equivalent. Therefore, the answer would be that the concepts are not identical, with the counterexample being a chiral knot and its mirror image.\n\nSo the assumptions here are:\n\n- K1 and K2 are knots in R^3.\n- Ambient isotopy requires a continuous family of homeomorphisms from the identity to the map taking K1 to K2.\n- Homeomorphism definition allows any homeomorphism, possibly orientation-reversing.\n\nTherefore, the problem is to show whether these two definitions are equivalent. The answer is no, with a counterexample involving chiral knots.\n\nBut when structuring the problem, I need to list the assumptions line by line. Let's see:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- K1 and K2 are knots in R^3.\n- Ambient isotopy is defined as an isotopy h: R^3 × [0,1] → R^3 such that h(K1, 0) = K1 and h(K1, 1) = K2.\n- Homeomorphism equivalence is defined as the existence of a homeomorphism g: R^3 → R^3 such that g(K1) = K2.\n\nThe problem is to determine if these two definitions are equivalent (i.e., whether two knots are equivalent under ambient isotopy if and only if there exists a homeomorphism mapping one to the other). But wait, actually, the user is asking whether the two definitions are the same. The answer is no, because the homeomorphism might reverse orientation, while ambient isotopy preserves it. Hence, the problem is to determine if these definitions are equivalent, with the conclusion that they are not, due to orientation.\n\nBut in structuring the problem, we just need to present the problem as per the user's question. The original question is whether these definitions are identical. So the problem is to either prove they are equivalent or provide a counterexample showing they are not.\n\nSo the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- Two knots K1 and K2 are considered equivalent if there exists an ambient isotopy h: R^3 × [0,1] → R^3 with h(K1, 0) = K1 and h(K1, 1) = K2.\n- Two knots K1 and K2 are considered equivalent if there exists a homeomorphism g: R^3 → R^3 such that g(K1) = K2.\n\nProblem: Determine if these two definitions of knot equivalence are identical, either by proving they are equivalent or providing a counterexample.\n\nBut wait, in the example given, the assumptions were more about properties of the objects involved. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted assumptions were:\n\n- n is an integer,\n- n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut in that case, the problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the original problem said \"for every integer n\". Wait, no. Wait, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the formatted version, the assistant added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, perhaps the example was a mistake. Wait, in the original example, the user wrote:\n\nOriginal problem:\nProve that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) - 6^n (3^n + 2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem:\nProve that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nBut that seems incorrect, because the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted version added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Maybe the example is wrong. But regardless, the user is providing that example to show how they want the formatting.\n\nBut in our current problem, the assumptions would be the conditions given in the problem. The original question is about two definitions. So the assumptions are the definitions themselves. But in the example, the assumptions were properties of the objects (n is integer, n divisible by 7). So perhaps in our case, the assumptions should be the properties given in the problem.\n\nWait, the original problem is asking about the equivalence of two definitions. So the definitions themselves are the assumptions. So each assumption is a condition applied to the objects (the knots K1 and K2). So:\n\nAssumption:\nTwo knots K1 and K2 are equivalent if there exists an ambient isotopy h: R^3 × [0,1] → R^3 such that h(K1,0)=K1 and h(K1,1)=K2.\n\nAssumption:\nTwo knots K1 and K2 are equivalent if there exists a homeomorphism g: R^3→R^3 such that g(K1)=K2.\n\nBut wait, in the example, each assumption was a single line, addressing only one property or condition applied to one object. So here, each definition is a separate assumption. So:\n\nAssumption:\nK1 and K2 are knots in R^3.\n\nAssumption:\nAmbient isotopy equivalence is defined by the existence of an isotopy h: R^3 × [0,1] → R^3 with h(K1,0)=K1 and h(K1,1)=K2.\n\nAssumption:\nHomeomorphism equivalence is defined by the existence of a homeomorphism g: R^3→R^3 with g(K1)=K2.\n\nProblem:\nDetermine whether these two definitions of knot equivalence are identical.\n\nBut perhaps to fit the example's style, where assumptions are properties of the objects (like n is an integer), here the assumptions would be:\n\n- K1 and K2 are knots in R^3.\n- Ambient isotopy between K1 and K2 exists.\n- Homeomorphism mapping K1 to K2 exists.\n\nBut the problem is asking whether these two conditions (ambient isotopy and homeomorphism) are equivalent. So perhaps the assumptions are that both definitions are considered for equivalence, and the problem is to determine if they are the same.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is presented as: given two knots, are they equivalent under ambient isotopy if and only if there's a homeomorphism mapping one to the other?\n\nIn the example, the assumptions included the conditions on n (n is integer, n divisible by 7), which were part of the problem's hypotheses. In this case, the problem's hypotheses are the two definitions. So to structure it:\n\nAssumption:\nK1 and K2 are knots in R^3.\n\nAssumption:\nAmbient isotopy equivalence requires an isotopy h: R^3 × [0,1] → R^3 with h(K1,0)=K1 and h(K1,1)=K2.\n\nAssumption:\nHomeomorphism equivalence requires a homeomorphism g: R^3→R^3 with g(K1)=K2.\n\nProblem:\nDetermine whether the two definitions of knot equivalence (ambient isotopy and homeomorphism) are identical.\n\nBut perhaps more succinctly:\n\nAssumption:\nK1 and K2 are knots in R^3.\n\nAssumption:\nTwo knots are equivalent if there exists an ambient isotopy between them.\n\nAssumption:\nTwo knots are equivalent if there exists a homeomorphism of R^3 mapping one to the other.\n\nProblem:\nAre these two definitions of knot equivalence identical?\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about the object (n) and its properties. Here, the objects are the knots and the definitions are the conditions. So maybe the assumptions should be:\n\n- K1 and K2 are knots in R^3.\n- Ambient isotopy is defined as a continuous family of homeomorphisms h_t: R^3 → R^3 for t ∈ [0,1] such that h_0 is the identity and h_1(K1) = K2.\n- Homeomorphism equivalence is defined as the existence of a homeomorphism g: R^3 → R^3 with g(K1) = K2.\n\nProblem:\nDetermine whether the existence of an ambient isotopy between K1 and K2 is equivalent to the existence of a homeomorphism mapping K1 to K2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to show that these two definitions are not equivalent, but the user is asking for clarification.\n\nBut according to the user's instruction, the task is to structure the problem into assumptions and problem statement. The example had assumptions as properties of the object (n is integer, n divisible by 7), leading to the problem statement. Here, the problem is comparing two definitions, so the assumptions would include the definitions themselves as separate conditions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are that K1 and K2 are knots, and the two definitions are given, and the problem is to see if they are equivalent.\n\nIn any case, I need to present the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nK1 and K2 are knots in R^3.\n\nAssumption:\nAmbient isotopy equivalence between K1 and K2 requires an isotopy h: R^3 × [0,1] → R^3 with h(K1,0)=K1 and h(K1,1)=K2.\n\nAssumption:\nHomeomorphism equivalence between K1 and K2 requires a homeomorphism g: R^3 → R^3 with g(K1)=K2.\n\nProblem:\nAre the ambient isotopy equivalence and homeomorphism equivalence definitions identical for knots in R^3?\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be phrased as: Prove or disprove that two knots K1 and K2 are equivalent under ambient isotopy if and only if there exists a homeomorphism of R^3 mapping K1 to K2.\n\nBut the user's original question is asking whether the two definitions are identical, so the problem is to determine this.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nK1 and K2 are knots in $\\mathbb{R}^3$,\nAmbient isotopy equivalence between K1 and K2 requires a continuous family of homeomorphisms $h_t: \\mathbb{R}^3 \\to \\mathbb{R}^3$ for $t \\in [0,1]$ with $h_0$ being the identity and $h_1(K_1) = K_2$,\nHomeomorphism equivalence between K1 and K2 requires a single homeomorphism $g: \\mathbb{R}^3 \\to \\mathbb{R}^3$ such that $g(K_1) = K_2$.\nProblem:\nDetermine whether the definitions of knot equivalence via ambient isotopy and via homeomorphism are identical.",
