    "Content": "I want to prove that if I omit the fact that $\\mu (X) < \\infty$ in Egorov theorem and place instead that our functions $|f_n| <g$ and $g$ is integrable, we still get the result of Egorov's theorem. Fix $m$ a natural number. I took $ w_{n} = |f_n-f|$ and thus by DCT $\\int |f_{n} - f|$ goes to zero. Then I took $\\bigcup_n {( w_{n} \\geq 1/m)}$. I need its measure to be finite. Its measure is less than the sum of the measures of each $ w_n\\geq 1/m)$ varying $n$, and by Tchebychev, this is less than $m\\int|f_{n} - f|$.  But I got stuck here. Any help is appreciated.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants to modify Egorov's theorem by removing the finite measure condition and replacing it with the assumption that the functions |f_n| are dominated by an integrable function g. The goal is to prove that under these new conditions, the conclusion of Egorov's theorem still holds, meaning that for every ε > 0, there exists a measurable set E with μ(E) < ε such that f_n converges to f uniformly on the complement of E.\n\nFirst, let me recall the original Egorov's theorem. It states that if we have a measure space (X, Σ, μ) with μ(X) < ∞, and a sequence of measurable functions f_n that converge pointwise to a function f almost everywhere, then for every ε > 0, there exists a set E with μ(E) < ε such that f_n converges to f uniformly on X \\ E. So the key change here is replacing the finite measure of X with the existence of an integrable dominating function g for |f_n|.\n\nThe user's approach starts by defining w_n = |f_n - f|. They mention using the Dominated Convergence Theorem (DCT) to conclude that the integral of |f_n - f| goes to zero. That makes sense because if |f_n| ≤ g and g is integrable, then by DCT, since f_n → f pointwise a.e., the integral of |f_n - f| should indeed go to zero. \n\nNext, the user considers the union over n of the sets where w_n ≥ 1/m. They want to show that this union has finite measure. They use Tchebychev's inequality (probably Chebyshev's inequality), which in measure theory terms states that for a non-negative measurable function h and a > 0, μ({h ≥ a}) ≤ (1/a) ∫ h dμ. Applying this to w_n and a = 1/m, we get μ(w_n ≥ 1/m) ≤ m ∫ w_n dμ. Since the integral of w_n goes to zero, for each fixed m and n sufficiently large, the measure of each set {w_n ≥ 1/m} becomes small. \n\nHowever, the user is stuck here. The problem arises because they take the union over all n of {w_n ≥ 1/m} and need to show that this union has finite measure. They bound the measure by the sum over n of m ∫ w_n dμ. But since we have an infinite sum here (as n goes to infinity), even if each term is small, the sum could potentially diverge unless the integrals ∫ w_n dμ decay sufficiently fast. \n\nWait, but the user is considering the measure of the union, which is ≤ sum of the measures. So they have μ(⋃ {w_n ≥ 1/m}) ≤ Σ μ(w_n ≥ 1/m) ≤ m Σ ∫ w_n dμ. Now, since ∫ w_n dμ → 0, but Σ ∫ w_n dμ might not converge. For example, if ∫ w_n dμ = 1/n, then the sum diverges. So this approach might not work directly. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user needs to find another way to apply Egorov's theorem under the new conditions. Let me think. If we have |f_n| ≤ g and g is integrable, then the set where g is large has finite measure because g is integrable. Specifically, for any k > 0, μ(g ≥ k) ≤ (1/k) ∫ g dμ < ∞. So maybe we can restrict our attention to a set where g is bounded, which would have finite measure, and then apply Egorov's theorem there. \n\nThat is, for each k, let X_k = {g ≤ k}. Since g is integrable, X_k has finite measure (because μ(X \\ X_k) = μ(g > k) ≤ (1/k) ∫ g dμ → 0 as k → ∞). Then, on each X_k, the functions f_n are bounded by k, and since μ(X_k) is finite, Egorov's theorem applies on X_k. So for each ε > 0 and each k, there exists a subset E_k of X_k with μ(E_k) < ε/2^k such that f_n converges uniformly on X_k \\ E_k. Then take E = ⋃ E_k ∪ (X \\ X_k). But then the measure of E would be ≤ Σ μ(E_k) + μ(X \\ X_k) ≤ Σ ε/2^k + μ(g > k). If we choose k large enough such that μ(g > k) < ε/2, then μ(E) ≤ ε/2 + ε/2 = ε. But we need to ensure uniform convergence on the complement of E. However, X \\ E = ⋂ (X_k \\ E_k) \\ (X \\ X_k). Wait, maybe this approach needs more precise handling. \n\nAlternatively, since g is integrable, for any δ > 0, there exists a set F of finite measure such that ∫_{X \\ F} g dμ < δ. Then, since |f_n| ≤ g, the functions f_n are integrable outside F. But I'm not sure how this helps. \n\nGoing back to the user's attempt: they fix m and take the union over n of {w_n ≥ 1/m}. They need this union to have finite measure. But even with the Chebyshev inequality, the measure is bounded by m Σ ∫ w_n dμ. If the sum Σ ∫ w_n dμ converges, then the measure is finite. However, since ∫ w_n dμ → 0, but the sum could still diverge. For example, if ∫ w_n dμ = 1/n, then Σ 1/n diverges. Therefore, this approach may not work unless we have a stronger condition on the convergence of ∫ w_n dμ. \n\nPerhaps the user needs to use the fact that convergence in L^1 implies convergence in measure. Since ∫ |f_n - f| dμ → 0, then for each δ > 0, μ(|f_n - f| ≥ δ) → 0 as n → ∞. But the union over n of {|f_n - f| ≥ 1/m} would then be a countable union of sets whose measures go to zero. However, countable unions of sets with measures approaching zero may not necessarily have finite measure unless we have some uniformity. \n\nWait, but maybe using the integrability of g. Since |f_n| ≤ g and g is integrable, then |f_n - f| ≤ |f_n| + |f| ≤ 2g a.e. (since |f| ≤ g a.e. by DCT). So 2g is also integrable. Then, for each m, the set where 2g ≥ 1/m has finite measure because μ(2g ≥ 1/m) = μ(g ≥ 1/(2m)) ≤ 2m ∫ g dμ < ∞. Therefore, the union over n of {|f_n - f| ≥ 1/m} is contained within the set where 2g ≥ 1/m, which has finite measure. Wait, is that true?\n\nLet me see. If |f_n - f| ≥ 1/m, then since |f_n - f| ≤ 2g, it follows that 2g ≥ 1/m on that set. Therefore, {|f_n - f| ≥ 1/m} ⊂ {2g ≥ 1/m}. Hence, the union over n of {|f_n - f| ≥ 1/m} is contained in {2g ≥ 1/m}, which has finite measure because g is integrable. Therefore, the measure of the union is finite. \n\nAh, that's a key point the user might have missed. By using the domination condition, the sets where |f_n - f| ≥ 1/m are all contained within {2g ≥ 1/m}, which has finite measure. Therefore, the union over n of these sets is a subset of a finite measure set, hence its measure is finite. Then, since the integral of |f_n - f| goes to zero, for each fixed m, the sum over n of μ(|f_n - f| ≥ 1/m) is finite because each term is ≤ m ∫ |f_n - f| dμ, and Σ ∫ |f_n - f| dμ converges (since ∫ |f_n - f| dμ → 0 and maybe decays, say, summably). However, actually, we don't know if the integrals decay summably. But if we can apply the DCT, then ∫ |f_n - f| dμ → 0, but the rate isn't specified. However, even if the sum diverges, the union's measure is still bounded by μ(2g ≥ 1/m), which is finite. So the user can proceed by taking the union inside a finite measure set, and then apply Egorov's theorem there. \n\nTherefore, the corrected approach would be: for each m, the set where |f_n - f| ≥ 1/m for any n is contained in {2g ≥ 1/m}, which has finite measure. Then, by Egorov's theorem on this finite measure set, for any ε > 0, there exists a subset E with measure < ε such that convergence is uniform outside E. Hence, combining this with the rest of the space where 2g < 1/m, which might require some adjustments. \n\nAlternatively, since the problematic set where convergence is not uniform is contained within {2g ≥ 1/m}, which has finite measure, we can apply the standard Egorov theorem on that finite measure set to get uniform convergence except on a set of measure < ε. \n\nPutting this all together, the correct approach would involve using the integrable domination to restrict to a finite measure set where the \"bad\" points (where convergence is not uniform) lie, then apply Egorov there. The user's mistake was perhaps not utilizing the domination to bound the measure of the union, thus not realizing that the union is within a finite measure set. Therefore, the key steps are:\n\n1. Use |f_n - f| ≤ 2g to bound the sets where |f_n - f| ≥ 1/m within {2g ≥ 1/m}, which has finite measure.\n2. Apply Egorov's theorem on this finite measure set to obtain uniform convergence except on a small measure set.\n3. Combine this with the rest of the space where 2g < 1/m, where convergence might already be uniform or handled differently.\n\nThis should lead to the desired result.",
