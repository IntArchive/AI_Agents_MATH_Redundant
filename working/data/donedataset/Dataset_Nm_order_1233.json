    "Content": "I watched this YouTube video that calculates the sum $$\\frac{1}{3\\cdot4}+\\frac{1\\cdot2}{3\\cdot4\\cdot5}+\\frac{1\\cdot2\\cdot3}{3\\cdot4\\cdot5\\cdot6}+\\cdots=\\frac16$$ then they ask, as a challenge to the viewer, what is the value of the sum $$\\frac{17}{75\\cdot76}+\\frac{17\\cdot18}{75\\cdot76\\cdot77}+\\frac{17\\cdot18\\cdot19}{75\\cdot76\\cdot77\\cdot78}+\\cdots$$ This got me thinking about a way to generalise this type of sum, i.e. how can one calculate the value of the sum $$\\frac{a}{b}+\\frac{a\\cdot(a+1)}{b\\cdot(b+1)}+\\frac{a\\cdot(a+1)\\cdot(a+2)}{b\\cdot(b+1)\\cdot(b+2)}+\\cdots$$ where $a,b\\in\\mathbb{N}$ and $a\\lt b$ . We can rewrite this sum as $$\\begin{align}\n\\frac{(b-1)!}{(a-1)!}\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\frac{(a+n)!}{(b+n)!}\n&=\\frac{(b-1)!}{(a-1)!\\cdot(b-a)!}\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\frac{(a+n)!\\cdot(b-a)!}{(b+n)!}\\\\\n&=\\frac{(b-1)!}{(a-1)!\\cdot(b-a)!}\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\frac1{\\binom{b+n}{b-a}}\\\\\n&=\\frac{(b-1)!}{(a-1)!\\cdot(b-a)!}\\left(\\sum_{n=b-a}^\\infty\\frac1{\\binom{n}{b-a}}-\\sum_{n=b-a}^{b-1}\\frac1{\\binom{n}{b-a}}\\right)\\\\\n\\end{align}$$ So this effectively simplifies down to the following problem: How can we evaluate the sum $$\\sum_{n=k}^\\infty \\frac1{\\binom{n}{k}}$$ for $k\\in\\mathbb{N}\\setminus\\{1\\}$ in a closed form? Numerically it appears that the solution is $$\\boxed{\\sum_{n=k}^\\infty \\frac1{\\binom{n}{k}}=\\frac{k}{k-1}}$$ which would mean that a closed form for our sum is $$\\boxed{\\frac{a}{b}+\\frac{a\\cdot(a+1)}{b\\cdot(b+1)}+\\frac{a\\cdot(a+1)\\cdot(a+2)}{b\\cdot(b+1)\\cdot(b+2)}+\\cdots=\\frac{(b-1)!}{(a-1)!\\cdot(b-a)!}\\left(\\frac{b-a}{b-a-1}-\\sum_{n=b-a}^{b-1}\\frac1{\\binom{n}{b-a}}\\right)}$$ testing this solution for our example gives $$\\begin{align}\n\\frac{17}{75\\cdot76}+\\frac{17\\cdot18}{75\\cdot76\\cdot77}+\\frac{17\\cdot18\\cdot19}{75\\cdot76\\cdot77\\cdot78}+\\cdots\n&=\\frac1{75}\\left(\\frac{17}{76}+\\frac{17\\cdot18}{76\\cdot77}+\\frac{17\\cdot18\\cdot19}{76\\cdot77\\cdot78}+\\cdots\\right)\\\\\n&=\\frac1{75}\\left(\\frac{(76-1)!}{(17-1)!\\cdot(76-17)!}\\left(\\frac{76-17}{76-17-1}-\\sum_{n=76-17}^{76-1}\\frac1{\\binom{n}{76-17}}\\right)\\right)\\\\\n&=114000634335804\\left(\\frac{59}{58}-\\sum_{n=59}^{75}\\frac1{\\binom{n}{59}}\\right)\\\\\n&=114000634335804\\left(\\frac{59}{58}-\\frac{1023230845711831}{1005887950021800}\\right)\\\\\n&=114000634335804\\left(\\frac1{29170750550632200}\\right)\\\\\n&=\\frac{17}{4350}\\\\\n\\end{align}$$ which seems to agree with numerical evaluation, but how do I prove this result? Edit: There is actually a much better closed form for this result as follows $$\\boxed{\\frac{a}{b}+\\frac{a\\cdot(a+1)}{b\\cdot(b+1)}+\\frac{a\\cdot(a+1)\\cdot(a+2)}{b\\cdot(b+1)\\cdot(b+2)}+\\cdots=\\frac{a}{b-a-1}}$$ which is found in the supplied answers.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This identity is easy to deduce once you notice that $$\\frac1{\\binom nk}-\\frac1{\\binom{n+1}k}=\\frac k{k+1}\\frac1{\\binom{n+1}{k+1}}$$ It thus follows that $$\\sum_{n=k}^\\infty\\frac1{\\binom nk}=\\frac k{k-1}\\sum_{n=k}^\\infty\\left(\\frac1{\\binom{n-1}{k-1}}-\\frac1{\\binom n{k-1}}\\right)=\\frac k{k-1}\\frac1{\\binom{k-1}{k-1}}=\\frac k{k-1}$$ and better yet, $$\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\frac1{\\binom{b+n}{b-a}}=\\frac{b-a}{b-a+1}\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\left(\\frac1{\\binom{b+n-1}{b-a-1}}-\\frac1{\\binom{b+n}{b-a-1}}\\right)=\\frac{b-a}{b-a+1}\\frac1{\\binom{b-1}{b-a-1}}$$ where the binomial expectedly cancels near the beginning of your calculations.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me start by reading through the problem carefully.\n\nThe original question is about finding a closed-form expression for the sum S = a/b + a(a+1)/(b(b+1)) + a(a+1)(a+2)/(b(b+1)(b+2)) + ... where a and b are natural numbers with a < b. The user also mentions that through some steps, they derived an expression involving binomial coefficients and found a numerical solution, but they want to prove the closed-form result, which turns out to be a/(b - a - 1).\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that a and b are natural numbers (so positive integers) and that a < b. Each assumption should be a single condition on one object. So:\n\nAssumption 1: a is a natural number.\nAssumption 2: b is a natural number.\nAssumption 3: a < b.\n\nThese are the key conditions given. The problem then asks to calculate the value of the sum S, which they rewrite in terms of factorials and binomial coefficients, but the core problem is to find the closed-form expression for the original sum. The user later mentions a better closed form found in answers: a/(b - a - 1). So the problem statement should be to prove that the sum equals a/(b - a - 1).\n\nWait, but in the problem statement as presented in the question, the user is asking to calculate the sum, but after their attempt, they found a proposed closed form. However, the edit mentions a much better closed form provided in answers. So the actual problem to state here is the one the user wants to prove, which is the closed-form given in the answers: S = a/(b - a - 1).\n\nTherefore, the problem part should be: Prove that the sum S = a/b + a(a+1)/(b(b+1)) + ... equals a/(b - a - 1).\n\nI need to make sure that the assumptions are correctly listed. The user specifies a, b ∈ N and a < b. So each of these is a separate assumption. So:\n\nAssumption 1: a is a natural number.\nAssumption 2: b is a natural number.\nAssumption 3: a is less than b.\n\nEach of these is a separate line addressing one condition on one object. Then the problem is to prove the closed-form expression for the sum.\n\nLet me check if there are any other implicit assumptions. The sum is infinite, so convergence might be an issue, but since a < b, the terms decrease sufficiently for convergence. However, the user didn't state that as an explicit assumption, so maybe we don't need to list it. The problem is structured based on given conditions, so the key ones are a, b natural numbers with a < b.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\na is a natural number,\nb is a natural number,\na is less than b.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\frac{a}{b}+\\frac{a(a+1)}{b(b+1)}+\\frac{a(a+1)(a+2)}{b(b+1)(b+2)}+\\cdots = \\frac{a}{b - a - 1}.$$\n\nI think that's correct. The user wants to show that this infinite sum equals a/(b - a - 1) under the given assumptions. The example given in the problem uses specific numbers (like 17, 75, 76, etc.), but the general case is a and b with a < b. The initial problem in the user's question is about generalizing the sum, so the formatted problem should reflect that general case.",
