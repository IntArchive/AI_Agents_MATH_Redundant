    "Content": "Let $p$ be prime and $\\left(\\frac{-3}p\\right)=1$ , where $\\left(\\frac{-3}p\\right)$ is Legendre symbol. Prove that $p$ is of the form $p=a^2+3b^2$ . My progress : $\\left(\\frac{-3}p\\right)=1 \\Rightarrow$ $\\left(\\frac{-3}p\\right)=\\left(\\frac{-1}p\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}p\\right)=(-1)^{\\frac{p-1}2}(-1)^{\\left\\lfloor\\frac{p+1}6\\right\\rfloor}=1 \\Rightarrow$ $\\frac{p-1}2+\\left\\lfloor\\frac{p+1}6\\right\\rfloor=2k$ I'm stuck here. This is probably not the way to prove that. Also tried this way: $\\left(\\frac{-3}p\\right)=1$ , thus $-3\\equiv x^2\\pmod{p} \\Rightarrow$ $p|x^2+3 \\Rightarrow$ $x^2+3=p\\cdot k$ stuck here too. Any help would be appreciated.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "First part:\n$$\\left(\\frac{-3}{p}\\right)=1 \\text{ if and only if }\\; p\\equiv{1}\\!\\!\\!\\!\\pmod{3}.\\tag{1}$$\nThis can be achieved through the Gauss quadratic reciprocity theorem in the most general form, or through the following lines. If $p=3k+1$, by the Cauchy theorem for groups there is an order-3 element in $\\mathbb{F}_p^*$, say $\\omega$; from $\\omega^3=1$ follows $\\omega^2+\\omega+1\\equiv 0\\pmod{p}$, hence:\n$$(2\\omega+1)^2 = 4\\omega^2+4\\omega+1 = 4(\\omega^2+\\omega+1)-3 = -3,$$\nand $-3$ is a quadratic residue $\\pmod{p}$. On the other hand, if $-3$ is the square of something $\\pmod{p}$, say $-3\\equiv a^2\\pmod{p}$, then:\n$$\\left(\\frac{a-1}{2}\\right)^3\\equiv\\frac{1}{8}(a^3-3a^2+3a-1)\\equiv\\frac{1}{8}\\cdot 8\\equiv{1},$$\nand $\\frac{a-1}{2}$ is an order-3 element in $\\mathbb{F}_{p}^*$. From the Lagrange theorem for groups it follows that $3|(p-1)$. Second part:\n$$\\text{If }p\\equiv 1\\pmod{3},\\qquad p=a^2+3b^2.\\tag{2}$$\nSince by the first part we know that $-3$ is a quadratic residue $\\pmod{p}$, there exists an integer number $c\\in[0,p/2]$ such that:\n$$ c^2+3\\cdot 1^2 = k\\cdot p.\\tag{3}$$\nThe trick is now to set a \"finite descent\" in order to have $k=1$. Let $d$ the least positive integer such that $c\\equiv d\\pmod{k}$. Regarding $(3)$ mod $k$, we have:\n$$ d^2+3\\cdot 1^2 = k\\cdot k_1.\\tag{4}$$\nSince the generalized Lagrange identity states:\n$$(A^2+3B^2)(C^2+3D^2)=(AC+3BD)^2 + 3(BC-AD)^2,\\tag{5}$$\nby multiplying $(3)$ and $(4)$ we get:\n$$ (cd+3)^2 + 3(c-d)^2 = k^2 pk_1.$$\nSince $cd+3\\equiv c^2+3\\equiv 0\\pmod{k}$ and $c\\equiv d\\pmod{k}$, we can rewrite the last line in the following form:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{cd+3}{k}\\right)^2+3\\left(\\frac{c-d}{k}\\right)^2 = k_1\\cdot p.\\tag{6}$$\nNow a careful analysis of the steps involved in the algorithm reveals that $k_1<k$, so the descent is able to reach $k_i=1$, or:\n$$ p = a^2 + 3b^2$$\nas wanted.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so the user wants me to structure this problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. Let me start by carefully reading the original question to identify all the assumptions and the core problem.\n\nThe title says: \"Let $p$ be prime and $\\left(\\frac{-3}p\\right)=1$. Prove that $p$ is of the form $p=a^2+3b^2$.\" \n\nThe question body reiterates this and adds some of the user's attempts. The key points here are that $p$ is a prime, the Legendre symbol $\\left(\\frac{-3}{p}\\right)$ equals 1, and the conclusion to be proven is that $p$ can be expressed as $a^2 + 3b^2$ for some integers $a$ and $b$.\n\nFirst, I need to list all assumptions. The problem states that $p$ is prime. That's one assumption. Then, the Legendre symbol condition $\\left(\\frac{-3}{p}\\right) = 1$ is another. These are the two main conditions given. The user in their attempt tried to break down the Legendre symbol into parts involving $\\left(\\frac{-1}{p}\\right)$ and $\\left(\\frac{3}{p}\\right)$, but that might not be necessary for the assumptions—since the problem already directly gives that the Legendre symbol is 1. So the two assumptions are:\n\n1. $p$ is a prime.\n2. $\\left(\\frac{-3}{p}\\right) = 1$.\n\nThe problem to prove is that $p$ can be written as $a^2 + 3b^2$. \n\nI should check if there are any other implicit assumptions. The original problem doesn't mention any restrictions on $a$ and $b$ beyond being integers, so the answer should just state the problem as proving $p = a^2 + 3b^2$ given those two assumptions. The user's own progress involves manipulating the Legendre symbol, but those steps don't add new assumptions—they're part of their attempt to solve it. Therefore, the formatted problem should only include the two explicit assumptions from the problem statement.\n\nSo the structured problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n$p$ is a prime,\n$\\left(\\frac{-3}{p}\\right) = 1$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $p$ is of the form $p = a^2 + 3b^2$.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is one line, addressing one property. The first assumption is about $p$ being prime. The second is the Legendre symbol condition. Both apply to the object $p$. There's no other conditions mentioned. The user's progress is their attempt, which isn't part of the problem's assumptions. Therefore, this should be correct.",
