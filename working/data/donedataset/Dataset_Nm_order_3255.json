    "Content": "Let $K$ be an arbitrary field, $p$ a prime and $a\\in K$. Show $f=x^p-a$ is either irreducible in\n  $K[x]$ or has a root in $K$. My strategy was to split this up into a case for each characteristic. The characteristic $p$ case is easy. Assume $f$ is reducible $=gh$ both smaller degree $g$ irreducible, with $\\alpha$ a root of $g$. Then in $K(\\alpha)[x]$, $f=(x-\\alpha)^p$. So $g=(x-\\alpha)^k$, and all the other factors of $f$ are of the same form. Hence they are all equal to the $minpoly(\\alpha)$ and the degree of $minpoly(\\alpha)|p$ so it is $1$ or $p$ and we are done. The characteristic $0$ case  and characteristic $q\\ne p$ I get stuck on. If $K$ contains a primitive $p$th root of unity $\\zeta$, then over $K(\\alpha)$, $f$ splits into linear factors. So the degree of the field extension for any root of $f$ is the same, so the degree of such a root is either $1$ or $p$. If $K$ does not have a primitive $p$th root of unity, then simply adjoin one. We know $[K(\\zeta):K]|p-1$ and by the previous step either $f$ is irreducible over $K(\\zeta)$ or splits into linear factors. If it is irreducible we are done, if not we have it splits into linear factors of the form $x-\\zeta^ia^{1/p}$, but I am unsure what to do from here. The characteristic $q$ case seems similar to the characteristic $0$ case but again I am stuck trying to finish the proof. Some googling has lead me to believe that this problem is generally approached using the field norm and if an accessible online reference exists I would love to see it, but I feel that in the context I have seen it should be entirely possible that this is done without needing the norm. As I have not seen the field norm before, I would like to know if there is a possible way to prove this without using it and hopefully that follows in the same vein my attempt at a proof did.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Starting where you have left off, if $f=gh$, then $g$ must be a product of terms of the form $x-\\zeta^i\\beta$, where my $\\beta$ is your $\\alpha^{1/p}$ (which I think is supposed to be $a^{1/p}$). Given $i$ and $j$ where $x-\\zeta^i\\beta$ is a factor of $g$ and $x-\\zeta^j\\beta$ isn't, there's an automorphism taking $\\zeta^i$ to $\\zeta^j$. The automorphism fixes $g$, since the coefficients of $g$ are in $K$, but it doesn't fix the factors of $g$, contradiction, since we have unique factorization of polynomials over a field.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem and structure it according to the user's format. The original question is about proving that the polynomial f = x^p - a over an arbitrary field K is either irreducible or has a root in K, without using the field norm. The user has already considered some cases, especially characteristic p, but is stuck on characteristic 0 and characteristic q ≠ p.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. Each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. Let's go through the problem step by step.\n\nThe problem states: Let K be an arbitrary field, p a prime, and a an element of K. We need to show that f = x^p - a is either irreducible in K[x] or has a root in K. \n\nSo the assumptions here are:\n\n1. K is an arbitrary field. (This is a single condition about K.)\n2. p is a prime number. (A property of p.)\n3. a is an element of K. (A property of a.)\n4. The polynomial f is defined as f = x^p - a in K[x]. (Definition of f.)\n\nThe problem is to prove that f is either irreducible over K or has a root in K. The user mentions that the characteristic p case is handled, but other characteristics are problematic. The user also mentions not using the field norm and wanting a proof along their attempted lines.\n\nWait, but in the example given by the user, they included an assumption that n is divisible by 7. However, in the original problem, the user didn't mention any such condition. So in this case, the problem's assumptions are just about K, p, a, and the definition of f. The problem statement doesn't impose additional conditions like specific characteristics unless they are part of the problem. Wait, but in the problem, the user splits into cases based on characteristic. However, in the formatted problem, should the assumptions include that? Probably not, because the problem is to handle arbitrary characteristic. The user is working through different cases, but the problem's assumptions don't restrict the characteristic. So the assumptions are general: K is any field, p is prime, a is in K, f is x^p - a.\n\nTherefore, the Assumption section should list these four points. Then the problem is to prove that f is either irreducible in K[x] or has a root in K.\n\nWait, but in the example provided, the user added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, the original problem in the example was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, no. Let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal problem in the example: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The user formatted it with assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove A(n) is divisible by 91. Wait, that seems conflicting. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That would mean the problem is now only for integers n divisible by 7. But the original problem was for all integers n. So perhaps the example is incorrect, but maybe the user intended to filter some unrelated information? Wait, perhaps the example is incorrect, but in the given problem here, the user is asking to structure the problem correctly. So perhaps in the example, the user made a mistake, but we should follow the instruction to structure the problem as per the given format, which includes listing all assumptions line by line.\n\nBut in the problem at hand, the problem states that K is arbitrary, p is prime, a is in K, and f is x^p - a. There are no additional assumptions. The user's attempt splits into cases based on characteristic, but those aren't part of the problem's assumptions. Therefore, the formatted problem should list:\n\nAssumption:\n- K is a field.\n- p is a prime number.\n- a is an element of K.\n- The polynomial f is defined as x^p - a in K[x].\n\nProblem: Prove that f is either irreducible in K[x] or has a root in K.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"Show f=x^p-a is either irreducible in K[x] or has a root in K\". So the problem is exactly that. The user's assumptions are K, p, a as given. So the formatted problem should list those as assumptions, each on a separate line. Then the problem is as stated.\n\nThe user's attempt discussed splitting into cases for different characteristics, but the problem itself doesn't specify any particular characteristic. The problem is for an arbitrary field, so the assumptions are general.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct formatting is:\n\nAssumption:\n- K is a field.\n- p is a prime number.\n- a is an element of K.\n- f is the polynomial x^p - a in K[x].\n\nProblem: Prove that f is either irreducible in K[x] or has a root in K.\n\nI think that's accurate. The user's example may have had an error, but following the instructions, we need to list all assumptions in the original problem. The original problem's assumptions are K is arbitrary field, p prime, a in K, f = x^p -a. The problem is to show f is either irreducible over K or has a root in K. The user's own attempt discusses cases, but those are part of the solution, not the problem statement. Hence, the assumptions are as above.",
