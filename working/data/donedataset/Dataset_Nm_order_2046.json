    "Content": "I've found the statement on the internet that the polynomial $x^3-5x$ is injective on the rational numbers, but without any comments on how to prove it. I think it means it must be easy, but I don't see how I can prove it. I'm getting a complicated expression, in which I don't see anything.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If $x^3 - 5x = y^3 - 5y$ with $x\\neq y$ then $x^3-y^3 = 5(x-y)$ or $x^2+xy+y^2=5$. Solving for $x$ in terms of $y$: $$x = \\frac{-y\\pm \\sqrt{y^2-4(y^2-5)}}2$$ So $20-3y^2$ has to be a square of a rational number. This is equivalent to finding integer solutions to $ 20q^2 - 3p^2= n^2$ with $(p,q)=1$. Show that this isn't possible $\\pmod 5$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The question is about proving that the polynomial f(x) = x³ - 5x is injective on the rational numbers. Injective means that if f(a) = f(b), then a must equal b for any rational numbers a and b. So, I need to show that if two rational numbers a and b satisfy f(a) = f(b), then a = b.\n\nFirst, I'll start by assuming that a and b are rational numbers such that f(a) = f(b). That gives me the equation:\n\na³ - 5a = b³ - 5b.\n\nMy goal is to show that this equation implies a = b. To do this, I'll rearrange the equation to bring all terms to one side:\n\na³ - b³ - 5a + 5b = 0.\n\nNext, I can factor the difference of cubes: a³ - b³ = (a - b)(a² + ab + b²). Similarly, the terms -5a + 5b can be factored as -5(a - b). So substituting these back into the equation gives:\n\n(a - b)(a² + ab + b²) - 5(a - b) = 0.\n\nFactor out the common term (a - b):\n\n(a - b)[(a² + ab + b²) - 5] = 0.\n\nFor this product to be zero, either (a - b) = 0 or the other factor [(a² + ab + b²) - 5] = 0. If (a - b) = 0, then a = b, which is what we want to prove. So the key is to show that the second factor cannot be zero when a and b are rational numbers, unless a = b.\n\nSo suppose, for contradiction, that there exist distinct rational numbers a and b (so a ≠ b) such that:\n\na² + ab + b² - 5 = 0.\n\nIf I can show that this equation has no solutions in rational numbers a and b (with a ≠ b), then the only possibility is that a = b, proving injectivity.\n\nNow, let's analyze the equation a² + ab + b² = 5 where a and b are rational numbers. Let me set a = p/q and b = r/s where p, q, r, s are integers, and q, s ≠ 0. But to make it simpler, since we can express both a and b with a common denominator, let's assume a = c/d and b = e/d where c, e, d are integers and d ≠ 0. Then substituting into the equation:\n\n(c/d)² + (c/d)(e/d) + (e/d)² = 5.\n\nMultiply both sides by d² to eliminate denominators:\n\nc² + ce + e² = 5d².\n\nNow, this is a Diophantine equation: c² + ce + e² = 5d². We need to check if there exist integers c, e, d (with d ≠ 0) such that this equation holds. If there are no non-trivial solutions (i.e., solutions where c ≠ e, since a ≠ b would imply c/d ≠ e/d, so c ≠ e), then our original assumption leads to a contradiction, and hence f is injective.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to show that if a and b are rational and satisfy a² + ab + b² = 5, then a = b. Let me explore that.\n\nSuppose a ≠ b. Then, the equation a² + ab + b² = 5 must hold. Let me see if there are any rational solutions to this equation where a ≠ b.\n\nLet me consider substituting variables. Let’s set t = a + b and s = ab. Then, we know that a² + ab + b² = (a + b)² - ab = t² - s. So the equation becomes t² - s = 5. So s = t² - 5.\n\nBut we also have that a and b are roots of the quadratic equation x² - tx + s = 0. Since a and b are rational, the discriminant of this quadratic must be a perfect square. The discriminant D is t² - 4s. Substituting s from earlier:\n\nD = t² - 4(t² - 5) = t² - 4t² + 20 = -3t² + 20.\n\nFor a and b to be rational, D must be a perfect square. Let’s denote D = k² for some integer k (since t is rational, let's say t = m/n where m and n are integers with n > 0 and gcd(m,n)=1). Then, substituting t = m/n, we have:\n\nD = -3(m/n)² + 20 = k².\n\nMultiply both sides by n²:\n\n-3m² + 20n² = (kn)².\n\nLet’s rearrange:\n\n20n² - 3m² = (kn)².\n\nThis is now an equation in integers: 20n² - 3m² = k²n².\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better approach. Alternatively, let's try to find rational solutions to a² + ab + b² = 5.\n\nSuppose a and b are rational. Let’s set a = b + h, where h is a non-zero rational number (since a ≠ b). Then substituting into the equation:\n\n(b + h)² + (b + h)b + b² = 5.\n\nExpanding:\n\n(b² + 2bh + h²) + (b² + bh) + b² = 5.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n3b² + 3bh + h² = 5.\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in b. For b to be rational, the discriminant of this quadratic must be a perfect square. Let’s write the equation as:\n\n3b² + 3hb + (h² - 5) = 0.\n\nThe discriminant D is:\n\n(3h)² - 4*3*(h² - 5) = 9h² - 12h² + 60 = -3h² + 60.\n\nFor b to be rational, D must be a perfect square. Let’s set D = k² where k is rational. So:\n\n-3h² + 60 = k².\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n3h² - 60 = -k².\n\nBut 3h² - 60 = -k² ⇒ 3h² + k² = 60.\n\nThis equation must hold for rational numbers h and k. Let’s clear denominators by letting h = p/q and k = r/q where p, q, r are integers, q > 0, and gcd(p, r, q) = 1. Substituting:\n\n3(p/q)² + (r/q)² = 60.\n\nMultiply both sides by q²:\n\n3p² + r² = 60q².\n\nNow, we need integer solutions (p, q, r) to 3p² + r² = 60q². Let’s see if there are any non-trivial solutions (i.e., where p ≠ 0, since h = p/q ≠ 0).\n\nSuppose q = 1. Then 3p² + r² = 60. Let’s check possible integer values of p.\n\nIf p = 0: r² = 60 ⇒ r is irrational. Not possible.\n\nIf p = 1: 3 + r² = 60 ⇒ r² = 57 ⇒ No integer solution.\n\np=2: 12 + r²=60 ⇒ r²=48 ⇒ No.\n\np=3: 27 + r²=60 ⇒ r²=33 ⇒ No.\n\np=4: 48 + r²=60 ⇒ r²=12 ⇒ No.\n\np=5: 75 > 60. So no solutions for q=1.\n\nq=2: Then 3p² + r² = 60*(4)=240.\n\nLooking for integers p and r such that 3p² + r²=240. Let's try p=0: r²=240 ⇒ Not a square. p=1: 3 + r²=240 ⇒ r²=237 ⇒ No. p=2: 12 + r²=240 ⇒ r²=228 ⇒ No. p=4: 48 + r²=240 ⇒ r²=192 ⇒ No. p=6: 3*36=108 ⇒ 108 + r²=240 ⇒ r²=132 ⇒ No. p=8: 3*64=192 ⇒ 192 + r²=240 ⇒ r²=48 ⇒ No. Similarly, p=10: 3*100=300 > 240. No solution here.\n\nq=3: 3p² + r² = 60*9=540. Let's see if there are any solutions. p=12: 3*144=432 ⇒ 432 + r²=540 ⇒ r²=108 ⇒ No. p=10: 3*100=300 ⇒ 300 + r²=540 ⇒ r²=240 ⇒ No. p=6: 3*36=108 ⇒ 108 + r²=540 ⇒ r²=432 ⇒ No. Not promising.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a solution with q=0, but q must be positive. It seems like there are no integer solutions for this equation. Therefore, the discriminant D cannot be a perfect square, which would imply that there are no rational numbers a and b with a ≠ b satisfying a² + ab + b² = 5. Thus, the only possibility is that a = b, proving that f is injective on the rationals.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure there are no solutions. Alternatively, maybe there are some solutions I missed. Let me check q=5: 3p² + r²=60*25=1500. Hmm, not helpful. Alternatively, maybe there's a modular contradiction here. For example, looking at the equation 3p² + r² = 60q² modulo 3. Then, modulo 3, the equation becomes r² ≡ 0 mod 3, so r must be divisible by 3. Let’s set r = 3s. Then substituting back into the equation:\n\n3p² + 9s² = 60q² ⇒ p² + 3s² = 20q².\n\nNow, looking at this equation modulo 4. Squares modulo 4 are 0 or 1. Let's see:\n\np² ≡ 0 or 1 mod4,\n\n3s² ≡ 0 or 3 mod4,\n\n20q² ≡ 0 mod4 (since 20 is divisible by 4).\n\nSo, p² + 3s² ≡ 0 mod4. Possible cases:\n\nIf p² ≡ 0, then 3s² ≡ 0 mod4 ⇒ s² ≡ 0 mod4 ⇒ s even.\n\nIf p² ≡1, then 3s² ≡ -1 mod4 ⇒ 3s² ≡3 mod4 ⇒ s² ≡1 mod4 ⇒ s odd.\n\nBut let's consider the equation p² + 3s² = 20q². Let’s factor out 4. Suppose p and s are both even. Let p=2p', s=2s'. Then equation becomes 4p'² + 12s'²=20q² ⇒ p'² +3s'²=5q². Repeating the modulo 4 analysis on this new equation:\n\np'² +3s'² ≡5q² mod4. Since 5≡1 mod4, it's equivalent to p'² +3s'² ≡q² mod4.\n\nAgain, possible cases:\n\nIf q is even, then q² ≡0 mod4. So p'² +3s'² ≡0 mod4. Possible if p' and s' both even.\n\nIf q is odd, q² ≡1 mod4. So p'² +3s'² ≡1 mod4. Let's check possible combinations:\n\np'² can be 0 or 1, 3s'² can be 0 or 3.\n\nIf p'²=0, 3s'²=1 mod4 ⇒ 3s'² ≡1 ⇒ s'² ≡3 mod4, which is impossible since squares are 0 or1.\n\nIf p'²=1, then 1 +3s'² ≡1 mod4 ⇒ 3s'²≡0 ⇒ s' even.\n\nThus, in any case, we can keep factoring out powers of 2. This suggests that p and s must be even, leading to an infinite descent unless p=s=q=0, which isn't valid since q>0. Therefore, the only solution is the trivial one where p=s=q=0, but q can't be zero. Hence, there are no non-trivial integer solutions to 3p² + r² = 60q², meaning there are no rational numbers a and b with a ≠ b satisfying a² + ab + b² =5. Therefore, the original equation f(a)=f(b) implies a=b, so the function is injective on the rationals.\n\nAnother approach could be to use calculus. For real numbers, if a function is strictly increasing or strictly decreasing on its entire domain, it's injective. However, the function f(x)=x³−5x has derivative f’(x)=3x²−5. The derivative is zero at x=±√(5/3), so the function has local maxima and minima there. Therefore, f is not injective on the reals. But on the rationals, maybe the critical points are irrational, so between the critical points, the function might be injective? However, this line of reasoning might not directly apply because injectivity on the rationals isn't determined by behavior on the reals. For example, even if the function isn't injective on the reals, it could still be injective on the rationals if the collisions only happen at irrational points. So the calculus approach might not be the right path here, but the algebraic approach we took earlier shows that there are no rational solutions where a ≠ b lead to f(a)=f(b).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the polynomial x³−5x is injective on the rational numbers because assuming f(a)=f(b) leads to a=b, as there are no other rational solutions.",
