    "Content": "Prove that the composition of differentiable functions is differentiable. That is, if $f$ is differentiable at $z$, and if $g$ is differentiable at $f (z)$, then $g\\circ f$ is differentiable at $z$. My attempt:\nI begin with\n$g(f(z+h))−g(f(z))=[g'(f(z))+\\epsilon $]$[f(z+h)−f(z)]$\nwhere  $\\epsilon→0$ as $h → 0$\nDoes anyone could help me with this exercise?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This is incredibly easy to prove if you have the following result: If a function $f$ is differentiable at $a$ then there exists a\n  continuous function $\\varphi$ defined on an interval\n  $[-\\epsilon,\\epsilon]$ such that $\\varphi(0)=0$ and $$ f(a+h) = f(a) + f'(a)h + \\varphi(h)h, $$ for all $h \\in (-\\epsilon,\\epsilon)$. And if such a continuous $\\varphi$ exists such that $$ f(a+h) = b + \\alpha h + \\varphi(h)h, $$ for all $h \\in (-\\epsilon,\\epsilon)$, then $f$ is differentiable in\n  $a$ with $f'(a) = \\alpha$. The chain rule follows by direct computation: $(g \\circ f)(a+h) = g(f(a+h))$, use that $f$ is differentiable to write $f(a+h)$ as $f(a) + f'(a)h + \\varphi_f(h)h$, and then call \"$f'(a)h + \\varphi_f(h)h$\" for $k$ and use that $g$ is differentiable. There's a little bit of bookkeeping needed to make sure that there do exist appropriate intervals around $0$ for the auxillary continuous functions, but it's not too bad. The best part about this proof is that it immediately generalizes to functions from $\\mathbb R^m$ to $\\mathbb R^n$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about proving that the composition of differentiable functions is differentiable. \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem mentions two functions, f and g. The assumptions should be about each function's differentiability at specific points. So:\n\n1. Function f is differentiable at a point z.\n2. Function g is differentiable at the point f(z).\n\nThese are two separate assumptions, each applying to one function and one condition (differentiability at a specific point). \n\nThe problem then asks to prove that the composition g∘f is differentiable at z. So the problem statement is straightforward. \n\nWait, in the example provided, the original problem mentioned divisibility by 91, but the formatted problem added an assumption about n being divisible by 7. But in the current problem, the user didn't add any extra assumptions. So I should just extract the given conditions from the original question. \n\nLooking at the user's example, they restructured the problem but included an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, that seems odd. Wait, no—the original example might have had a different original problem. Wait, the example given by the user shows that in the original problem, the user wrote \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n)...\" is divisible by 91. Then in the formatted problem, the assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original. That suggests that perhaps the example might have had a mistake. Wait, perhaps there was a miscommunication. Wait, maybe the example was from a different problem? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Hmm. Maybe there was a mistake in the example. \n\nBut regardless, the user wants me to process the current problem. Let's focus on that. The current problem is to prove that the composition of differentiable functions is differentiable. The original question states: if f is differentiable at z, and g is differentiable at f(z), then g∘f is differentiable at z. So the assumptions here are exactly those two differentiability conditions. \n\nTherefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n- f is differentiable at z.\n- g is differentiable at f(z).\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption, each applying to one function at a specific point. Then the problem is to prove that the composition g∘f is differentiable at z. \n\nI don't see any other hidden assumptions here. The user's example might have included an extra assumption because perhaps the original problem required it, but in this case, the problem as stated in the Math Stack Exchange question doesn't have any additional conditions. So I should just list those two assumptions. \n\nSo the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is differentiable at z,\ng is differentiable at f(z).\nProblem:\nProve that g∘f is differentiable at z.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is on a separate line and addresses one property of one object. Here, each line refers to the differentiability of one function at a specific point. That seems correct.",
