    "Content": "Consider sticks of lengths $1^{1/k},\\space 2^{1/k},\\space 3^{1/k},\\space\\dots,\\space n^{1/k}$ where $k,n\\in\\mathbb{Z^+}$ . Here is an example with $k=4$ and $n=50$ . I have discovered that, as $n\\to\\infty$ , the probability that three randomly chosen sticks can form a triangle approaches $1-\\dfrac{1}{\\binom{2k}{k}}$ . Is there a combinatorial proof for this fact? Non-combinatorial proof Suppose, for a given $n$ , we have already chosen $a^{1/k}$ and $b^{1/k}$ , and we are about to choose $c^{1/k}$ . If $a^{1/k},b^{1/k},c^{1/k}$ can be the side lengths of a triangle, then $\\left|a^{1/k}-b^{1/k}\\right|<c^{1/k}<a^{1/k}+b^{1/k}$ , that is, $\\left|a^{1/k}-b^{1/k}\\right|^k<c<\\left(a^{1/k}+b^{1/k}\\right)^k$ . So the probability that $a^{1/k},b^{1/k},c^{1/k}$ can be the side lengths of a triangle is $$\\frac{\\min\\left(\\left(a^{1/k}+b^{1/k}\\right)^k,n\\right)-\\left|a^{1/k}-b^{1/k}\\right|^k}{n}$$ (I'm ignoring the fact that the numerator should be an integer, and the fact that we cannot choose the same stick twice; these facts will be irrelevant when we take the limit as $n\\to\\infty$ .) Then we take the average as $a$ and $b$ run from $1$ to $n$ . $$\\frac{1}{n^2}\\sum_{a=1}^n\\sum_{b=1}^n\\frac{\\min\\left(\\left(a^{1/k}+b^{1/k}\\right)^k,n\\right)-\\left|a^{1/k}-b^{1/k}\\right|^k}{n}$$ As $n\\to\\infty$ , the limiting probability is the integral $$\\int_0^1\\int_0^1\\left(\\min\\left(\\left(x^{1/k}+y^{1/k}\\right)^k,1\\right)-\\left|x^{1/k}-y^{1/k}\\right|^k\\right)\\mathrm dx\\mathrm dy$$ $$=\\int_0^1\\left(\\int_0^{(1-y^{1/k})^k}\\left(x^{1/k}+y^{1/k}\\right)^k\\mathrm dx+\\int_{(1-y^{1/k})^k}^1 1\\mathrm dx-\\int_0^y\\left(y^{1/k}-x^{1/k}\\right)^k\\mathrm dx-\\int_y^1\\left(x^{1/k}-y^{1/k}\\right)^k\\mathrm dx\\right)\\mathrm dy$$ which can be evaluated using hypergeometric functions, and simplifies to $$1-\\frac{1}{\\binom{2k}{k}}$$ Desmos agrees. In fact, $k$ does not have to be a positive integer; it can be any positive real number. ( Fun fact : As $k\\to 0$ , the probability that the three sticks can form a triangle approaches $\\dfrac{\\pi^2}{6}k^2$ .) But since I am looking for a combinatorial proof, I am restricting $k$ to positive integers. Generalization Numerical investigation suggests the following generalization (which I am not asking to prove): As $n\\to\\infty$ , the probability that $m$ randomly chosen sticks can form an $m$ -gon approaches $1-\\dfrac{k!^{m-1}}{((m-1)k)!}$ . Context This is another question of mine about the probability that three sticks can form a triangle. My previous question was here .",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Divide all the stick lengths by $n^{1/k}$ . Then as $n → ∞$ , the distribution of each stick choice approaches the same distribution as that of the largest of $k$ independent samples from the uniform distribution $U(0, 1)$ . That is, if we select $3k$ independent $U(0, 1)$ samples $a_1, …, a_k, b_1, …, b_k, c_1, …, c_k$ , then we seek the probability that $a = \\max_i a_i$ , $b = \\max_i b_i$ , and $c = \\max_i c_i$ form a triangle. To see that the distributions have the same CDF: $$\\Pr\\left[a ≤ \\frac{m^{1/k}}{n^{1/k}}\\right] = \\Pr\\left[a_1 ≤ \\frac{m^{1/k}}{n^{1/k}} ∧ ⋯ ∧ a_k ≤ \\frac{m^{1/k}}{n^{1/k}}\\right] = \\left(\\frac{m^{1/k}}{n^{1/k}}\\right)^k = \\frac mn.$$ Now, with probability $\\frac13$ , $c$ is the largest of $a, b, c$ (the other cases are symmetric). Under this condition, let $x_i = \\frac{a_i}{c}$ , $y_i = 1 - \\frac{b_i}{c}$ , and observe that $x_1, …, x_k, y_1, …, y_k$ are themselves $2k$ independent $U(0, 1)$ samples. The only way for $a, b, c$ to fail to form a triangle is if $a + b < c \\iff \\frac ac < 1 - \\frac bc$ , or equivalently, all the $x_i$ are less than all the $y_i$ . So we get a triangle with probability $1 - \\frac{1}{\\binom{2k}{k}}$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions and then the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one condition or property applied to a single object. The problem is then restated concisely.\n\nThe original problem here is about the probability that three randomly chosen sticks can form a triangle, approaching a specific formula as n tends to infinity. The user also mentions that k is a positive integer and n is a positive integer going to infinity. There's a mention of a combinatorial proof, and the problem is generalized, but the user specifies they are restricting k to positive integers for the combinatorial proof.\n\nSo, the assumptions would include:\n- The sticks have lengths 1^(1/k), 2^(1/k), ..., n^(1/k) where k and n are positive integers.\n- k is a positive integer (since the combinatorial proof requires it, even though the non-combinatorial allows any positive real).\n- n approaches infinity.\n- The sticks are chosen randomly (uniformly, I assume, since they're taking an average over all a and b).\n- The selection is without replacement, but the user says that taking the same stick twice is irrelevant in the limit, so perhaps this isn't an assumption here.\n- The probability is calculated in the limit as n approaches infinity.\n\nThe problem is to prove that the limiting probability is 1 - 1/binom(2k, k) using a combinatorial proof.\n\nWait, the user's own non-combinatorial proof involves integrals and hypergeometric functions, leading to that result, but they are asking specifically for a combinatorial proof. The problem statement should reflect that they want a combinatorial proof for this probability.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n1. Sticks have lengths 1^(1/k), 2^(1/k), ..., n^(1/k) where k is a positive integer.\n2. n is a positive integer that approaches infinity.\n3. Three sticks are chosen randomly (uniformly) from the set.\n4. The probability is considered in the limit as n approaches infinity.\n5. The sticks are distinct (since the user mentions ignoring that they can't choose the same stick twice, but in the limit, it's irrelevant, so maybe this isn't an assumption here. But the original problem mentions \"three randomly chosen sticks\" which implies without replacement. However, the user says those details are irrelevant in the limit. So perhaps this isn't an assumption here.)\n\nBut the key points are:\n\n- k is a positive integer (as per the combinatorial proof restriction).\n- n approaches infinity.\n- Sticks are selected uniformly at random.\n\nSo structuring the assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\nk is a positive integer,\nn is a positive integer,\nn approaches infinity,\nthree sticks are chosen uniformly at random from the set {1^(1/k}, 2^(1/k}, ..., n^(1/k}}.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement in the example includes only the necessary assumptions. In the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", and an additional assumption that n is divisible by 7. But in this case, the original problem states \"k,n ∈ Z^+\", and the user is restricting k to positive integers for the combinatorial proof.\n\nSo perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nk is a positive integer,\nn is a positive integer,\nn approaches infinity,\nsticks have lengths i^(1/k) for i from 1 to n,\nthree sticks are chosen uniformly at random.\n\nBut maybe even more concise. The problem is about the limiting probability as n approaches infinity, given k is a positive integer.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nk is a positive integer,\nn is a positive integer,\nn approaches infinity,\nsticks have lengths 1^(1/k}, 2^(1/k}, ..., n^(1/k},\nthree sticks are chosen uniformly at random.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the limiting probability that three randomly chosen sticks can form a triangle is 1 - 1/ binomial(2k, k) using a combinatorial proof.\n\nWait, but the user's original problem title mentions \"three randomly chosen sticks can form a triangle is 1−1/ binomial(2k,k)\" and asks for a combinatorial proof. So the problem is to prove that probability, using combinatorial methods.\n\nSo putting it all together, the assumptions are the conditions under which the problem is posed, and the problem is the statement to prove.\n\nLet me check again the example. The original problem had A(n) defined, and the formatted assumption lists that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Then the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nIn the current problem, the key conditions are that k is a positive integer (since the combinatorial proof is restricted to that), n is a positive integer going to infinity, and sticks are lengths i^(1/k). The problem is to show the probability approaches 1 - 1/binom(2k,k) combinatorially.\n\nHence, the assumptions would include:\n\n- k is a positive integer,\n- n is a positive integer,\n- n approaches infinity,\n- sticks have lengths 1^(1/k), 2^(1/k), ..., n^(1/k},\n- three sticks are chosen uniformly at random.\n\nBut each assumption should be on one line and address only one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\nk is a positive integer,\nn is a positive integer,\nn approaches infinity,\nsticks have lengths 1^(1/k}, 2^(1/k}, ..., n^(1/k},\nthree sticks are chosen uniformly at random.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the limiting probability that three randomly chosen sticks can form a triangle is 1 - 1/ binomial(2k, k) using a combinatorial proof.\n\nWait, but in the problem description, the user also mentions that they are averaging over a and b, but in the limit, it's an integral. However, since we're focusing on the assumptions and problem statement, perhaps the integral part is part of their non-combinatorial proof and not part of the problem's assumptions.\n\nThe key is that the problem is to prove the probability tends to that expression combinatorially. So the assumptions are the setup (k positive integer, n goes to infinity, sticks as defined), and the problem is to prove the probability result combinatorially.\n\nI think that's the structure. Let me make sure each assumption is one line and one condition. For example, \"sticks have lengths...\" is one condition, \"three are chosen...\" another, etc.\n\nYes. So the final formatted problem would be as above.",
