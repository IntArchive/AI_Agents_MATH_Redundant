    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let's take a look at this problem from Math Stack Exchange. The user wants to prove that the infinite sum of 1 divided by n cubed times (n+1) cubed from n=1 to infinity equals 10 minus pi squared. They also asked if the residue theorem can be used for this proof.\n\nFirst, I need to structure the problem according to the given format. The original example had assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object. In the example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. But here, the problem is about an infinite series. Let me parse the question carefully.\n\nThe sum is from n=1 to infinity of 1/(n^3(n+1)^3). The user is asking if the residue theorem can prove that this sum equals 10 - π². So, the main problem is to prove the equality of the series to 10 - π². The question mentions using the residue theorem, but the formatted problem example didn't include the method in the problem statement, just the problem itself. So in the formatted version, the problem should just be to prove the equality, and the assumptions would relate to the conditions given.\n\nNow, what assumptions are present here? The sum is from n=1 to infinity, so the variable n is an integer starting at 1. Each term is 1 divided by n cubed times (n+1) cubed. The series is infinite, so convergence is implied, but maybe that's not an assumption the user is making—it's part of the problem. The original example listed assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the key assumptions might be about n being a positive integer starting at 1, and the structure of the general term. However, since the problem is about the sum, maybe the assumptions are about the convergence or the terms of the series.\n\nBut looking at the example, the assumptions were about the variable in the expression (n being integer and divisible by 7). Here, in the sum, n is an integer index starting at 1. So perhaps the assumptions are that n is a positive integer, each term is defined as 1/(n^3(n+1)^3), and the series converges. Wait, but in the original example, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, since the problem is about the sum, perhaps the main assumption is that n is a positive integer, and the series is summed over all such n from 1 to infinity. However, in the original example, the assumptions were specific to the variable in the expression. Let me check the original example again.\n\nOriginal example's problem was about A(n) = 5^n(...) -6^n(...), and the assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So in that case, the assumptions were conditions on n. Here, in the current problem, the sum is over n starting at 1, so n is a positive integer. But the problem statement doesn't specify any restrictions on n beyond that. Therefore, the assumption here would be that n is a positive integer. However, in the sum, n is a dummy variable, so maybe the assumption is that the series is taken over positive integers n ≥ 1. Also, the question is about the sum being equal to 10 - π². So maybe the only assumption is that the series converges, but the problem is to compute its sum. However, in the example, the assumption was about the variable's properties. But in the example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the assumption was that n is an integer divisible by 7. Wait, in that case, maybe the assumptions were part of the problem's conditions. Wait, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption was that n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe there was a mistake in the example? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds the assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps the example was incorrect, but I need to follow the user's instructions regardless. The user's example had assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7, but the original problem was for every integer n. That might have been an error, but maybe the user intended to show that even with the assumption that n is divisible by 7, the conclusion holds. Hmm, perhaps the example was a mistake, but I need to proceed with the current problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the user is asking to prove that the sum from n=1 to infinity of 1/(n^3(n+1)^3) equals 10 - π². The assumptions here would be about the terms of the series. Since each term is 1/(n^3(n+1)^3), n starts at 1, so each term is defined for n ≥ 1, and n is an integer. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n- The series is summed from n=1 to infinity.\n- Each term of the series is 1/(n^3(n+1)^3).\n\nBut maybe the key assumptions are that n is a positive integer and that the series converges. However, convergence might be part of what needs to be established, but the problem is to compute the sum. In the example, assumptions were about n's properties. So here, the main assumption is that n is a positive integer. Alternatively, since the problem is about an infinite series, the convergence is necessary, but the problem statement may not require listing that as an assumption if it's part of the problem. However, according to the user's example, they listed assumptions as conditions on the variables. So in this case, the assumption is that n is a positive integer. But in the sum, n is a dummy variable, so maybe the assumption is on the index of summation. Wait, perhaps the problem doesn't have explicit assumptions beyond the terms being defined as such. Alternatively, maybe there are no additional assumptions beyond the series structure given. Wait, looking at the example again, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, and in the formatted problem, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like a mistake because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. That would be an incorrect assumption. But perhaps the user intended to structure it differently. Maybe the example had a typo. Anyway, perhaps I should proceed by listing the assumptions that are given in the problem. In the current problem, the sum is from n=1 to infinity of 1/(n^3(n+1)^3). The problem is to prove that this sum equals 10 - π². The assumptions here would be that n is a positive integer, and each term is as defined. However, since the problem is presented as is, maybe the only assumption is that the series is defined for n ≥ 1. So:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nThe series is summed from n=1 to infinity,\nEach term of the series is 1/(n³(n+1)³).\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn ≥ 1,\nEach term of the series is 1/(n³(n+1)³).\n\nBut the problem is about the sum of these terms from n=1 to infinity. Alternatively, maybe the assumptions are just that n is a positive integer, since that's the index of summation. The problem statement is to compute the sum. So the formatted problem should list assumptions related to the problem's conditions. However, in the example, the assumption included a condition that wasn't in the original problem (divisible by 7), which might have been a mistake. But perhaps in the current case, the only assumption is that n is a positive integer. Let me check the original problem again. The original problem states the sum from n=1 to infinity, so n is a positive integer. Hence, the assumption would be that n is a positive integer. Each term is 1/(n^3(n+1)^3), so maybe another assumption is about the form of the term. But according to the example, each assumption should be one property or condition. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nThe general term of the series is 1/(n³(n+1)³).\n\nBut the problem is to sum this from n=1 to infinity, so perhaps the second assumption is redundant. Alternatively, the problem is to sum this specific series. So, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty }\\frac{1}{n^3(n+1)^3}=10-\\pi^2.$$\n\nBut the example included two assumptions for the variable n. So perhaps here, since n starts at 1 and is an integer, we can list:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn ≥ 1.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were listed as separate lines. So:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn is greater than or equal to 1,\nThe series is composed of terms 1/(n³(n+1)³).\n\nBut maybe the third point is part of the problem statement. The problem is to sum those terms. So perhaps the assumptions are just about n. Then:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the series $$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty }\\frac{1}{n^3(n+1)^3}$$ equals \\(10 - \\pi^2\\).\n\nBut the original example had the assumption about divisibility by 7, which might have been part of the problem's hidden condition, but in this case, the problem is straightforward. The user's example might have had an error, but I'll proceed with what's logical. The key is to list all assumptions explicitly. Since the problem is about an infinite series, perhaps another assumption is that the series converges, but that's part of what might need to be proven. However, the problem statement just gives the sum as equal to 10 - π², implying convergence. But in the example, assumptions were about the variable's properties. So here, the main assumption is that n is a positive integer. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty }\\frac{1}{n^3(n+1)^3}=10-\\pi^2.$$\n\nBut wait, the original example had two assumptions for one variable: \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, \"n is a positive integer\" can be split into \"n is an integer\" and \"n ≥ 1\". So following the example's style, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn ≥ 1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty }\\frac{1}{n^3(n+1)^3}=10-\\pi^2.$$\n\nYes, that seems consistent with the example where each assumption is a separate line, each addressing one condition. So even though \"n is a positive integer\" can be considered a single assumption, splitting it into \"n is an integer\" and \"n ≥ 1\" aligns with the example's structure. Therefore, that's how I should format it.",
