    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let us prove the version of the statement in the Wikipedia entry: If $ 0 \\to V_1 \\to V_2 \\cdots \\to V_r\\to 0$ is an exact sequence of finite dimensional vector spaces then $$\\sum_{i=1}^{r} (-1)^i \\dim V_i=0.$$ Let $f_0$ be the first map in the sequence, $f_i$ be the map from $V_i$ to $V_{i+1}$ , etc.\nBy the Rank Nullity theorem, we have $\\dim V_i = \\dim\\ker f_i + \\dim \\operatorname{im} f_i.$ Thus the left hand side is $$\\sum_{i=1}^{r} (-1)^i \\dim\\ker f_i+\\sum_{i=1}^{r} (-1)^i \\dim\\operatorname{im} f_i.$$ Now by the defining property of an exact sequence, $\\operatorname{im} f_i = \\ker f_{i+1}.$ Place that information into one of the sums, and the two sums then cancel out. Note that in order for the series in question to converge, the sequence must be of the form in this answer, perhaps with extra $0$ 's.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So the user provided a question from Math Stack Exchange about an exact sequence of finite-dimensional vector spaces and a formula relating the dimensions of the even and odd indexed spaces. My task is to structure this problem according to the specified format, which includes listing assumptions and then stating the problem clearly.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question. The user mentions an exact sequence of vector spaces V_i and states a formula where the sum of dimensions of even-indexed spaces equals the sum of dimensions of odd-indexed spaces. The question asks for the name of the theorem and a reference for the proof.\n\nFollowing the example given, I need to extract assumptions from the problem. The example listed each assumption on a separate line, addressing one property per object. So looking at the original problem:\n\n- The vector spaces V_i are finite-dimensional. That's one assumption.\n- The sequence involving the V_i is exact. That's another assumption.\n- The exact sequence is written as ... → V_i → V_{i+1} → ..., which I think implies that the sequence is infinite in both directions, but since the user specifies finite-dimensional, maybe the sequence is finite? Wait, but the formula sums over all even and odd integers, which might suggest an infinite sequence. Hmm, but the problem mentions \"given finite dimensional vector spaces V_i\", so maybe the index set is such that each V_i is finite-dimensional, but the sequence could be infinite? Or perhaps the sequence is finite, but the indices are in some range. However, the formula uses sums over all even and odd integers, which might be a way to express alternating sums in a finite exact sequence. Wait, in the standard rank-nullity theorem for exact sequences, the alternating sum of dimensions is zero. For example, in a short exact sequence 0 → A → B → C → 0, we have dim B = dim A + dim C. If you have a longer exact sequence, the alternating sum of dimensions is zero. So for example, in an exact sequence V₁ → V₂ → V₃ → V₄, then dim(V₁) - dim(V₂) + dim(V₃) - dim(V₄) = 0. So if you group even and odd indices, maybe that's equivalent to the sums of evens and odds being equal. Wait, but in the problem, the formula is sum_{n even} dim V_n = sum_{n odd} dim V_n. So if the exact sequence is of the form ... → V_i → V_{i+1} → ..., and the formula holds, perhaps under the assumption that the sequence is finite but with indices in 2Z and 2Z+1? Wait, maybe the exact sequence is indexed over all integers, but each V_i is finite-dimensional, and the sequence is exact everywhere. Then, the formula given sums over even integers and odd integers. So the key assumptions would be:\n\n1. Each V_i is a finite-dimensional vector space.\n2. The sequence ... → V_i → V_{i+1} → ... is exact.\n3. The indices n are such that the sums are over even and odd integers.\n\nWait, but the problem as stated in the user's original question says \"Given finite dimensional vector spaces V_i and an exact sequence ... → V_i → V_{i+1} → ...\", so maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- Each V_i is a finite-dimensional vector space.\n- The sequence formed by the V_i is exact.\n- The exact sequence is such that the index set is integers (possibly infinite in both directions?), but each V_i is finite-dimensional. However, in the formula, the sums are over all even and odd integers, which would require that only finitely many V_i have non-zero dimension; otherwise, the sums might diverge. So perhaps there's an implicit assumption that the sequence is bounded (i.e., only finitely many V_i are non-zero), so that the sums are finite. But the original problem statement doesn't mention that. Alternatively, the problem might be considering a finite exact sequence, but the indices are partitioned into even and odd. Wait, perhaps the original theorem applies to any exact sequence of finite-dimensional vector spaces, regardless of length, as long as the sequence is exact. Let me check.\n\nIn standard linear algebra, for a finite exact sequence of vector spaces, the alternating sum of dimensions is zero. For example, in a sequence V₁ → V₂ → V₃ → V₄ → V₅, exact at each term, then dim(V₁) - dim(V₂) + dim(V₃) - dim(V₄) + dim(V₅) = 0. If the number of terms is even, then grouping even and odd indices would give sum of evens minus sum of odds equals zero, but if the number of terms is odd, it would be sum of odds minus evens equals zero. Wait, but the formula in the problem states that sum over even indices equals sum over odd indices, which would hold only if the number of terms is even? Hmm, perhaps I need to think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the exact sequence is infinite in both directions but with only finitely many non-zero terms. In that case, the alternating sum of dimensions would be zero, leading to sum of evens equals sum of odds. For example, consider an exact sequence ... → 0 → V₁ → V₂ → V₃ → 0 → ..., then the alternating sum would be dim V₁ - dim V₂ + dim V₃ = 0, which would imply dim V₁ + dim V₃ = dim V₂. But that doesn't necessarily make the sum of evens equal to sum of odds unless the indices are arranged in a way that evens and odds alternate. Wait, maybe if the exact sequence is periodic or something. This is getting confusing.\n\nWait, the problem states the formula sum_{n even} dim V_n = sum_{n odd} dim V_n. Let me take a standard example. Suppose we have a short exact sequence 0 → A → B → C → 0. Then the alternating sum is dim A - dim B + dim C = 0 ⇒ dim A + dim C = dim B. Here, if the indices are 1 (A), 2 (B), 3 (C), then sum of evens (B) equals sum of odds (A + C). So yes, in this case, sum of even indices (B) equals sum of odd indices (A + C). Similarly, in a longer exact sequence, say 0 → V₁ → V₂ → V₃ → V₄ → 0, exact everywhere. Then the alternating sum is dim V₁ - dim V₂ + dim V₃ - dim V₄ = 0 ⇒ (dim V₁ + dim V₃) = (dim V₂ + dim V₄). Here, the sum of odd indices (1 and 3) equals sum of even indices (2 and 4). So in this case, the formula holds. Therefore, perhaps the theorem is that for any finite exact sequence of finite-dimensional vector spaces, the sum of dimensions of spaces at even indices equals the sum at odd indices, provided that the sequence starts and ends at zero. Wait, but in the problem statement, the exact sequence is written as \"... → V_i → V_{i+1} → ...\", which might imply that it's infinite, but in practice, such exact sequences in finite-dimensional contexts are finite. So the key assumptions would be:\n\n1. Each V_i is a finite-dimensional vector space.\n2. The sequence ... → V_i → V_{i+1} → ... is exact.\n3. The sequence has finitely many non-zero terms (so that the sums are finite).\n\nBut the original problem statement doesn't mention the finiteness of the sequence, only that the V_i are finite-dimensional. However, in order for the sums over all even and odd integers to be finite, the sequence must have only finitely many non-zero V_i. So perhaps that's an implicit assumption.\n\nTherefore, structuring the problem according to the format:\n\nAssumptions:\n- Each V_i is a finite-dimensional vector space.\n- The sequence $\\cdots \\rightarrow V_i \\rightarrow V_{i+1} \\rightarrow \\cdots$ is exact.\n- The exact sequence has finitely many non-zero terms.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum_{n \\in 2\\mathbb{Z}} \\dim V_n = \\sum_{n \\in 2\\mathbb{Z} + 1} \\dim V_n.$$\n\nBut wait, in the example provided by the user, the assumption included specific conditions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". In the current problem, the original question states \"Given finite dimensional vector spaces V_i and an exact sequence...\", so the assumptions are that each V_i is finite-dimensional and the sequence is exact. However, the example structured the problem by listing each assumption separately. So perhaps here, the assumptions are:\n\n- Each V_i is a finite-dimensional vector space.\n- The sequence $\\cdots \\rightarrow V_i \\rightarrow V_{i+1} \\rightarrow \\cdots$ is exact.\n- The index set for the sequence is the integers (since the sums are over all even and odd integers). But this might be redundant because the sequence is written as ...→V_i→V_{i+1}→... which implies the index is over integers.\n\nHowever, the critical point is that the sequence is exact and each V_i is finite-dimensional. The third assumption about finitely many non-zero terms might be necessary for the sums to converge, but the original problem statement doesn't mention this. Maybe the problem is considering that even if the sequence is infinite, but for each V_i, the dimension is non-zero for finitely many i, so the sums are finite. Alternatively, the formula might hold even in some infinite cases where the sums converge, but in practice, for vector spaces, dimensions are non-negative integers, so an infinite sum would diverge unless only finitely many terms are non-zero. Therefore, the third assumption is necessary but implicit.\n\nBut in the original problem statement, the user didn't mention anything about the sequence being finite or having finitely many non-zero terms. Therefore, perhaps the problem as stated in the question has an error, but the answer would need to include that the sequence is finite (i.e., bounded) for the sums to make sense. However, since the user is asking to structure the problem based on the information given, we can only use what's provided. The original problem states \"Given finite dimensional vector spaces V_i and an exact sequence...\", so the key points are:\n\nAssumption 1: Each V_i is a finite-dimensional vector space.\nAssumption 2: The sequence $\\cdots \\rightarrow V_i \\rightarrow V_{i+1} \\rightarrow \\cdots$ is exact.\n\nBut if the sequence is infinite in both directions with infinitely many non-zero V_i, then the sums over all even and odd integers would be infinite, which isn't meaningful. Hence, the problem likely assumes that only finitely many V_i are non-zero, making the sums finite. However, the original problem statement does not explicitly mention this. Therefore, perhaps the correct assumptions are as above, but the problem's validity depends on the sequence having finite support (i.e., only finitely many non-zero terms). Since the user didn't mention it, but the example included specific assumptions, maybe here we should list:\n\nAssumptions:\n- Each V_i is a finite-dimensional vector space.\n- The sequence $\\cdots \\rightarrow V_i \\rightarrow V_{i+1} \\rightarrow \\cdots$ is exact.\n- Only finitely many V_i are non-zero.\n\nBut again, the original problem doesn't state the third point. However, the formula given in the problem requires the sums to be finite, so it's a necessary assumption. Therefore, even though the user didn't mention it, it's part of the problem's implicit assumptions. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering a finite exact sequence, but the indices are extended infinitely with zeros. For example, the exact sequence could be 0 → V₁ → V₂ → ... → V_n → 0, and then all other V_i for i outside that range are zero. In that case, the sums over even and odd indices would be finite.\n\nIn conclusion, to structure the problem correctly, the assumptions should include that each V_i is finite-dimensional, the sequence is exact, and that the sequence has finite support (only finitely many non-zero terms). Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nEach $V_i$ is a finite-dimensional vector space,\nThe sequence $\\cdots \\rightarrow V_i \\rightarrow V_{i+1} \\rightarrow \\cdots$ is exact,\nOnly finitely many $V_i$ are non-zero.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum_{n \\in 2\\mathbb{Z}} \\dim V_n = \\sum_{n \\in 2\\mathbb{Z} + 1} \\dim V_n.$$\n\nBut I need to check if the original problem mentions anything about finite support. The original problem says \"Given finite dimensional vector spaces V_i\", which implies each V_i is finite-dimensional, but doesn't specify that there are finitely many of them. However, since the formula involves sums over all even and odd integers, the only way these sums are finite is if only finitely many V_i are non-zero. Hence, this is an implicit assumption that must be included.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the index set is not the entire integers but a finite range, and the sums are over even and odd indices within that range. For example, if the sequence is V₁ → V₂ → V₃ → V₄, then summing even indices (V₂, V₄) and odd indices (V₁, V₃). In that case, even if all V_i are non-zero, but the sequence is finite, the sums would be finite. However, the original problem's formula uses 2Z and 2Z+1, which suggests the indices are over all integers. Therefore, including the assumption that only finitely many V_i are non-zero is necessary.\n\nBut the user's original question didn't state this. However, when structuring the problem according to the example, we need to list all assumptions, even if they are implicit. The example given in the user's prompt included an assumption that \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, looking back: the original example was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted problem included an assumption that \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but that's incorrect, because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the formatted problem's assumption should not include \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Wait, the user-provided example might have an error. Let me check:\n\nOriginal example problem:\n\"Prove that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\"\n\nFormatted problem's assumption:\n\"$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\"\n\nBut the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should not include \"n is divisible by 7\". Therefore, the example given by the user might be incorrect. That suggests that when formatting the current problem, I need to be careful to extract the correct assumptions from the original problem, even if the user's example is flawed.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question says: \"Given finite dimensional vector spaces $V_i$ and an exact sequence $\\cdots\\rightarrow V_i\\rightarrow V_{i+1}\\rightarrow\\cdots$, we have [formula].\" Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. Each $V_i$ is a finite-dimensional vector space.\n2. The sequence $\\cdots \\rightarrow V_i \\rightarrow V_{i+1} \\rightarrow \\cdots$ is exact.\n\nThe third assumption, about the sequence having finitely many non-zero terms, is not stated explicitly in the problem. However, since the sums in the formula are over all even and odd integers, which would otherwise be infinite (and hence undefined unless most terms are zero), we must infer that only finitely many $V_i$ are non-zero. Therefore, this is an implicit assumption that should be listed.\n\nBut since the original problem didn't mention it, perhaps it's part of the problem's context. In mathematical literature, when dealing with such exact sequences and such sums, it's standard to assume the sequence has finite support unless stated otherwise. Hence, it's reasonable to include it as an assumption.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should include:\n\nAssumption:\nEach $V_i$ is a finite-dimensional vector space,\nThe sequence $\\cdots \\rightarrow V_i \\rightarrow V_{i+1} \\rightarrow \\cdots$ is exact,\nOnly finitely many $V_i$ are non-zero.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum_{n \\in 2\\mathbb{Z}} \\dim V_n = \\sum_{n \\in 2\\mathbb{Z} + 1} \\dim V_n.$$\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is considering a finite exact sequence where the indices are arranged such that the first and last terms are zero, then the alternating sum would equate the even and odd sums. But since the problem's formula is presented as a general statement for any such exact sequence, the key assumptions are the finite-dimensionality, exactness, and finite support.\n\nThus, this should be the correct formatted problem.",
