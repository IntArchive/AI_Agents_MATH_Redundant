    "Content": "Here's a homework question I'm struggling with: Let $f,g$ two convex functions. Prove that $h(x)=\\max\\{f(x),g(x)\\}$ is\nalso convex I don't know where to begin. The only thing I had in mind was was to try proving that if a function is convex on two sets $A$ and $B$ , it is also convex on their union. That does not seem right though, for example, if I glue together $f(x)=x^2, g(x)=\\frac{x^2}{1000}$ where $f$ is defined on $[0,1]$ and $g$ on $(1,2]$ . Anyway, that was the only thing I thought about. Any better ideas? thanks!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Hint: Use the characterization that $h$ is convex if and only if, for every $t$ in $[0,1]$ and every $(x,y)$, $h(tx+(1-t)y)\\leqslant th(x)+(1-t)h(y)$. Second hint: One wants to prove that $h(z)\\leqslant th(x)+(1-t)h(y)$ where $z=tx+(1-t)y$. Since $h=\\max\\{f,g\\}$, this is equivalent to the two inequalities\n$$\nf(z)\\leqslant th(x)+(1-t)h(y),\\qquad g(z)\\leqslant th(x)+(1-t)h(y).\n$$\nConsider the first inequality. By convexity of $f$, one knows that $f(z)\\leqslant tf(x)+(1-t)f(y)$. Furthermore, $f(x)\\leqslant$ $____$ and $f(y)\\leqslant$ $____$, hence...",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into their specified format. The example they provided involved listing assumptions line by line and then stating the problem.\n\nFirst, I need to read the original problem carefully. The question is about proving that the maximum of two convex functions is also convex. The user mentions they're struggling with where to begin and considered an approach about convexity on unions of sets, but realized that might not work with their example.\n\nNow, I need to filter out unrelated information. The original question includes the user's thought process about gluing functions on different intervals, but that's part of their confusion, not part of the problem's assumptions. The actual problem statement is to prove that h(x) = max{f(x), g(x)} is convex when f and g are convex. The key assumptions here are that f and g are convex functions. The rest of the user's example with specific functions on intervals seems like their own attempt, not part of the problem's given conditions.\n\nSo, the assumptions should be that f is a convex function and g is a convex function. Each of these is a separate assumption applied to each function. The problem statement then is to prove that h(x) = max{f(x), g(x)} is also convex.\n\nI need to make sure there are no other hidden assumptions. The problem doesn't specify any particular domain or other conditions, so just the convexity of f and g. The user’s example with f(x)=x² and g(x)=x²/1000 on different intervals is their own counterexample to their initial idea about unions, but the actual problem doesn't restrict the domains; it's likely assuming functions defined on the same convex domain. However, the problem as stated in the title and the initial question doesn't mention the domain, so maybe that's an oversight. But since the user didn't specify, I should stick to what's given: f and g are convex, and h is their max. Therefore, the assumptions are just that f and g are convex functions. Each on their own line.",
