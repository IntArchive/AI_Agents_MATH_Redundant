    "AcceptedAnswer": "The first step in these cases is to get rid of nested transcendental functions, which we otherwise have no idea how to integrate.

Notice also, that all the interesting dependence on $n$ is now a prefactor. The second term remains to compute (and should be independent on $n$, based on the expression we are trying to prove): $$- \\frac1{2n}\\int_0^\\pi \\frac{\\cos x}{\\sin x}\\sin (2nx)\\,dx$$\nThis can be resolved in many ways. One way is by taking a shortcut through complex series (or recalling from physics the formula for finite diffraction grating):\n$$2i\\sin (2nx)=e^{2nxi}-e^{-2nxi}$$\n$$2i\\sin x=e^{xi}-e^{-xi}$$\nFor less writing, use $q=e^{xi}$.\n$$\\frac{\\sin 2nx}{\\sin x}=\\frac{q^{2n}-q^{-2n}}{q-q^{-1}}=\n\\frac{q^{-2n+1}-q^{2n+1}}{1-q^2}=\nq^{-2n+1}\\frac{1-q^{4n}}{1-q^2}\n$$\nRecognize finite geometric sum:\n$$=q^{-2n+1}\\sum_{k=0}^{2n-1} q^{2k}=\\sum_{k=0}^{2n-1} q^{2k-2n+1}=q^{-2n+1}+\\cdots+q^{-1}+q+\\cdots q^{2n-1}$$\nwhich is a symmetric sum of every second power.\nRecall also $\\cos x = \\frac12(q+q^{-1})$.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The problem is to show that the integral from 0 to π of ln(sin x) times cos(2nx) dx equals -π/(2n). The user mentioned trying substitutions and the Taylor series of ln(sin x) without success. Let me think about possible approaches.\n\nFirst, I remember that integrals involving ln(sin x) often use symmetry or known Fourier series. Since there's a cos(2nx) term here, maybe Fourier series or orthogonality relations could be useful. Let me recall that ln(sin x) can be expressed as a Fourier series. Wait, there's a known series expansion for ln(sin x) on the interval (0, π). Let me check that.\n\nYes, the Fourier series of ln(sin x) is something like -ln 2 - Σ (cos(2kx))/k from k=1 to infinity. That might be helpful here. If I substitute this series into the integral, then multiply by cos(2nx) and integrate term by term. Because of orthogonality, most terms would vanish except when 2k = 2n, which would pick out the term with k = n. Let me write this out.\n\nSo, ln(sin x) = -ln 2 - Σ_{k=1}^∞ (cos(2kx))/k. Then, the integral becomes the integral from 0 to π of [-ln 2 - Σ_{k=1}^∞ (cos(2kx)/k] * cos(2nx) dx. The integral of -ln 2 * cos(2nx) over 0 to π would be zero because the integral of cos(2nx) over [0, π] is zero unless n=0, but n is a positive integer here. Then, the sum term would integrate term by term. Each term would be -1/k times the integral of cos(2kx)cos(2nx) dx from 0 to π.\n\nUsing orthogonality: the integral of cos(2kx)cos(2nx) dx over 0 to π is zero unless k = n, in which case it's π/2. Wait, but when k = n, cos^2(2nx) over 0 to π. The integral of cos^2(ax) dx over 0 to π is π/2. So, each term in the sum would be -1/k * (π/2) δ_{kn}, where δ is the Kronecker delta. Therefore, the only term that survives is when k = n, giving -1/n * π/2. Hence, the integral becomes -π/(2n). That matches the desired result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe integration by parts could work. Let me try that. Let u = ln(sin x) and dv = cos(2nx) dx. Then, du = (cos x / sin x) dx, and v = (1/(2n)) sin(2nx). So, integration by parts gives uv evaluated from 0 to π minus integral of v du. The uv term would be [ln(sin x) * (1/(2n)) sin(2nx)] from 0 to π. At x=0 and x=π, sin x is zero, so ln(sin x) approaches negative infinity, but sin(2nx) is zero. So, maybe the boundary terms are zero? But I have to be careful with limits. Let x approach 0 from the right: ln(sin x) ~ ln x, and sin(2nx) ~ 2nx. So, the product would be ln x * (2nx)/(2n) = x ln x, which approaches zero as x→0+. Similarly at π, sin(2nπ) is zero. So, boundary terms are zero.\n\nThen, the integral becomes - integral from 0 to π of v du = - (1/(2n)) ∫ sin(2nx) * (cos x / sin x) dx. Hmm, that seems more complicated. The integral becomes -1/(2n) ∫ [sin(2nx) cos x / sin x] dx. Let me simplify sin(2nx) / sin x. Recall that sin(2nx) = 2 sin(nx) cos(nx). But maybe there's a better identity. Alternatively, sin(2nx) / sin x can be expressed as a sum of cosines. For example, using the identity sin(mx)/sin x = sum_{k=0}^{m-1} 2 cos((m - 1 - 2k)x). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, express sin(2nx) as 2 sin(nx) cos(nx), so sin(2nx)/sin x = 2 sin(nx) cos(nx)/sin x. But sin(nx)/sin x can be written as a sum of cosines as well. This seems messy. Maybe integrating by parts isn't the best approach here.\n\nAlternatively, consider using the Fourier series approach as earlier. Since the first method worked out, maybe that's the way to go. So the key steps would be:\n\n1. Recall the Fourier series expansion of ln(sin x) on (0, π).\n2. Substitute the series into the integral.\n3. Use orthogonality of the cosine functions to eliminate all terms except the one where k = n.\n4. Compute the resulting integral, which gives the desired result.\n\nThis seems straightforward once you know the Fourier series of ln(sin x). Let me verify the Fourier series. The expansion is ln(sin x) = -ln 2 - Σ_{k=1}^∞ (cos(2kx))/k. Yes, that's correct. This can be derived from the complex logarithm or by integrating known series. Then substituting this into the integral gives the result directly.\n\nAnother approach might be to consider differentiating a known integral with respect to a parameter. For example, consider integrals of the form ∫ sin^a x dx or similar, but that might not be helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, consider expanding ln(sin x) as its Fourier series and then integrating term by term, which is what we did. That seems the most direct method. Therefore, the solution hinges on knowing the Fourier series of ln(sin x), which allows the integral to be evaluated term by term, leveraging orthogonality to simplify the sum.",
