    "AcceptedAnswer": "Note that \n$$2(\\sin k)(\\sin(0.5))=\\cos(k-0.5)-\\cos(k+0.5).$$\nThis is obtained by using the ordinary expression for the cosine of a sum. Add up, $k=1$ to $n$.  On the right, there is mass cancellation. We get \n$$\\cos(0.5)-\\cos(n+0.5).$$\nThus our sum of sines is \n$$\\frac{\\cos(0.5)-\\cos(n+0.5)}{2\\sin(0.5)}.$$\nWe can now obtain the desired bound for $|A_n|$.  For example, $2$ works, but not by much. We could modify the appearance of the above formula by using the fact that \n$\\cos(0.5)-\\cos(n+0.5)=2\\sin(n/2)\\sin(n/2+0.5)$. Generalization : The same idea can be used to find a closed form for\n$$\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\sin(\\alpha +k\\delta).$$\nSums of cosines can be handled in a similar way. Comment :  This answer was written up because the OP, in a comment, asked for a solution that only uses real functions.  However, summing complex exponentials, as in the solution by @Eric Naslund, is the right way to handle the problem.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example provided helps clarify what's needed. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original problem from Math Stack Exchange. The problem is about showing that the sequence A_n, defined as the sum from k=1 to n of sin k, is bounded. The user wants me to list all assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object, and then state the problem clearly.\n\nLooking at the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. However, in the formatted problem, they only listed n as an integer, but in the problem statement, the divisibility by 7 was part of the original question. Wait, actually in the example, the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7, but the formatted assumption included it. Hmm, maybe that's because the original problem had a condition that the divisibility by 91, which factors into 7 and 13. So perhaps the example extracted the necessary assumptions to apply modular arithmetic.\n\nBut in the current problem, the question is about the boundedness of A_n, the sum of sin k from k=1 to n. The assumptions here would be on n and the terms of the sum. Let me think. The problem defines A_n as the sum from k=1 to n of sin k. So each term is sin k where k is a positive integer. The problem is to show there exists an M>0 such that |A_n| < M for every n. \n\nWhat are the assumptions here? The key points are that n is a positive integer because the sum starts at k=1 and goes up to n. Also, each term in the sum is sin(k), where k is an integer. However, sine function is applied to integer arguments, but in radians or degrees? The standard in mathematics is radians unless specified, so that's an assumption: the angles are in radians. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify, so maybe that's an implicit assumption. However, if the problem is from a standard calculus context, we can assume radians. But maybe the user wants to list all explicit assumptions. The problem statement doesn't mention units for the sine function, so maybe it's not necessary here. Alternatively, perhaps the key assumptions are that k is an integer, n is a positive integer, and the sum is over these integer values. However, since the problem is about boundedness, the critical point is that the terms are sin(k) with k in natural numbers. But in terms of assumptions, maybe just that n is a positive integer. Wait, the problem says \"for every n\", so n is any positive integer, and A_n is defined for each n. So the assumptions are:\n\n1. n is a positive integer.\n2. Each term in the sum A_n is sin(k), where k is an integer from 1 to n.\n\nBut the example given in the problem didn't list the terms of the sum, only the variable n's properties. Wait, in the example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in the original problem, the question was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem had n divisible by 7. That seems like the user might have made a mistake, but perhaps the original problem actually had a condition that n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe I need to check again.\n\nOriginal example problem says: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted assumptions are n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems conflicting. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. So perhaps there was a mistake in the example. But maybe the user intended that the problem actually requires n to be divisible by 7, but the original problem statement didn't mention it. That might be a problem. But regardless, the user's example shows that assumptions are listed even if they are not in the original problem but inferred. However, in the current problem, the user wants to structure the problem as per the example, which may involve listing assumptions even if they are implicit.\n\nSo for the current problem: \"Let A_n = sum_{k=1}^n sin k, show that there exists M>0, |A_n| < M for every n.\" The assumptions would be:\n\n1. n is a positive integer.\n2. Each term sin(k) is evaluated at k in radians (assuming that's the context).\n3. The sum is from k=1 to n.\n\nBut perhaps in the problem statement, the key is that k is an integer, so sin(k) is evaluated at integer radians. But maybe that's not necessary to state, as in standard math problems, trigonometric functions are in radians unless stated otherwise. Alternatively, maybe the problem doesn't require specifying radians, since even if it were in degrees, sin(k) for integer k would still be bounded, but the sum might behave differently. However, in the context of this problem, it's more likely radians.\n\nBut the example didn't mention anything about radians, so maybe it's not necessary. The main assumptions here are that n is a positive integer and A_n is defined as the sum of sin(k) from k=1 to n. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n- A_n is the sum of sin(k) for k from 1 to n.\n\nBut the problem states \"for every n\", so n is any positive integer, so the first assumption is that n is a positive integer. The second assumption is the definition of A_n. But the example's assumptions included only the conditions on the variables, not the definition of the expression. Wait, in the example, the assumptions were:\n\n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\n\nBut the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem had a typo, and the correct problem requires n to be divisible by 7, hence the assumption. But if the problem states \"for every integer n\", then the assumption should not include divisibility by 7. Therefore, maybe the example is incorrect, but the user wants me to follow the format regardless.\n\nIn the current problem, the user wants to structure the problem as per the example. So perhaps the assumptions should list all necessary conditions. The problem is to show that A_n is bounded, i.e., there exists M such that |A_n| < M for all n. The key here is that n is a positive integer. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n- Each term in the sum A_n is sin(k), where k is a positive integer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that k is an integer, which it is since k runs from 1 to n, which are integers. But since the problem defines A_n as such, perhaps the key assumption is that n is a positive integer. Therefore, the assumptions line by line would be:\n\n1. n is a positive integer.\n2. A_n is defined as the sum from k=1 to n of sin(k).\n\nBut the example listed two assumptions, one about n being an integer and another about n being divisible by 7. So in this case, for the current problem, the first assumption is that n is a positive integer, and the second might be about the definition of A_n. However, the example's first assumption was \"$n$ is an integer\", and the second was \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". But in the current problem, the problem statement defines A_n as the sum, so perhaps the definition of A_n is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. The example's formatted problem included the definition of A(n) in the problem statement. So in the example, the assumptions were about the variable's properties, and the problem statement included the expression to be proved.\n\nTherefore, in the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n\nBecause the problem is about showing that for every n (positive integer), the sum is bounded. The definition of A_n is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. So the only assumption is that n is a positive integer. Wait, but the example included both n being an integer and n being divisible by 7. If the original problem in the example was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added the assumption that n is divisible by 7, that suggests a discrepancy. Maybe the example is incorrect, but the user wants the current problem to follow the same structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem mistakenly added that n is divisible by 7. That would be a mistake. But perhaps the user intended that the problem has certain hidden assumptions. For example, if the original problem had a condition that n is divisible by 7, but the user's example shows that. However, given that the example may have an error, but the current problem needs to follow the format.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's task is to filter unrelated information and structure the problem. The original question is: \"Let A_n = sum_{k=1}^n sin k, show that there exists M>0, |A_n| < M for every n.\" So the problem is to show the boundedness of the partial sums of sin(k) over positive integers k.\n\nThe assumptions here are that:\n\n1. n is a positive integer.\n2. k is an integer ranging from 1 to n.\n3. The sine function is evaluated at each integer k.\n\nBut perhaps the key assumptions are just about n being a positive integer, and the sum being defined as such. The problem statement already defines A_n, so the assumptions would be the conditions on n and the terms. Since the problem is general, the main assumption is that n is a positive integer. Therefore, the formatted assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nShow that there exists M > 0 such that |A_n| < M for every n, where A_n = ∑_{k=1}^n sin k.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were two separate points. But in this case, maybe only one assumption is needed. Alternatively, if the problem involves other hidden conditions, but I don't see any. The key is that n is a positive integer. The sine terms are automatically handled as they're part of the problem's definition. So the answer should be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nShow that there exists M > 0 such that |A_n| < M for every n, where A_n = ∑_{k=1}^n sin k.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem considers the terms sin(k) where k is an integer, which is already implied by the summation index. But maybe the example's formatting requires each assumption to address one property applied to one object. So n being a positive integer is one assumption, and the sum being over k=1 to n is part of the problem statement. But perhaps there's another assumption. For instance, the problem might assume that the sine function is evaluated in radians, but that's standard. If the problem didn't specify, maybe it's not an assumption to list here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that each term sin(k) is real, which it is, but that's inherent. So the main assumption is n is a positive integer. Therefore, the formatted problem would be as above.",
