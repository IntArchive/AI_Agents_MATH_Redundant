    "Content": "Trying to show using a different approach that $\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\sqrt x \\ln x}{x^2-x+1}dx =\\frac{\\pi^2\\sqrt 3}{9}-\\frac{8}{3}G\\, $ I have stumbled upon this series: $$\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\sin\\left(n\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)}{(2n+1)^2}$$ The linked proof relies upon this trigamma identity . Now by rewriting the integral as: $$I=\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\sqrt{x}\\ln x}{x^2-2\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)x+1}dx$$ And using that: $$\\frac{\\sin t}{x^2-2x\\cos t+1}=\\frac{1}{2i}\\left(\\frac{e^{it}}{1-xe^{it}}-\\frac{e^{-it}}{1-xe^{-it}}\\right)=\\Im \\left(\\frac{e^{it}}{1-xe^{it}}\\right)=$$ $$=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\Im\\left(x^n e^{i(n+1)t}\\right)=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty x^n\\sin((n+1)t)$$ $$I=\\frac{1}{\\sin \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)}\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty  \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3} (n+1) \\right)\\int_0^1 x^{n+1/2} \\ln x dx$$ $$\\text{Since} \\  \\int_0^1 x^p \\ln x dx= -\\frac{1}{(p+1)^2}$$ $$I=-\\frac{2}{\\sqrt 3} \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{\\sin\\left((n+1)\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)}{(n+1+1/2)^2}=-\\frac{8}{\\sqrt 3}\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\sin\\left(n\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)}{(2n+1)^2} $$ And well by using the previous link we can deduce that the series equals to $\\frac{G}{\\sqrt 3} -\\frac{\\pi^2}{24}$ , where $G$ is Catalan's constant. I thought this might be a coefficient of some Fourier series, or taking the imaginary part of $\\left(\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{e^{i\\frac{n\\pi}{3}}}{(2n+1)^2}\\right)$ , but I was not that lucky afterwards. Is there a way to show the result without relying on that trigamma identity? Another approach to the integral would of course be enough.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to help format this problem from Math Stack Exchange according to the user's specifications. Let me first read through the original question carefully to understand what's being asked and identify the key components.\n\nThe original problem is about proving a specific series sum equals a combination of Catalan's constant and π². The user also mentions an integral approach they tried, which leads them to the series in question. But they want to know if there's another method to show the result without using the trigamma identity mentioned in the linked proof.\n\nThe task is to extract the assumptions and the problem statement, filtering out any extraneous information. The example provided shows that assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. The problem statement is then clearly stated.\n\nLooking at the problem here, the series is given as the sum from n=1 to infinity of sin(nπ/3) divided by (2n+1) squared, and it's supposed to equal G/sqrt(3) minus π²/24. The user derived this through an integral involving a substitution and a series expansion, leading to the series. They want an alternative approach, either to the series or the integral.\n\nBut according to the formatting instructions, I need to list assumptions. Let's see. The problem is to prove the equality of the series to the given expression. The original problem mentions the integral approach, but the user is looking for another method. However, in the formatted example, assumptions were about the variables involved. Here, perhaps the assumptions are about the convergence of the series, or properties of the sine function, or the domain of n. But the original problem doesn't explicitly state assumptions like \"n is an integer\" or \"the series converges\". However, in the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the series starts at n=1, so n is a positive integer. Also, the sine function here has argument nπ/3, which cycles every 6 terms. Maybe that's part of the problem's structure, but the user hasn't stated any specific conditions beyond the series definition.\n\nWait, the user is trying to prove the equality. So the assumptions would be the conditions under which the equality holds. But in the example, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7, but in the problem statement here, the series is over positive integers n, so perhaps the assumption is that n is a positive integer. Also, maybe the convergence of the series is assumed, but since the problem is to evaluate it, that's part of the problem, not an assumption.\n\nBut the example given in the original instruction had the user rephrasing the problem's assumptions. For the example problem, the original assumption was that n is an integer, but the user added that n is divisible by 7. Wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem included an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like maybe a mistake? Wait, the original problem in the example was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted problem lists assumptions as n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But that's conflicting because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. So maybe the example was incorrect, or perhaps the user made a mistake there. But perhaps the original problem had a different condition. Wait, perhaps the example was a mistake, but the user wants the assistant to follow the format, regardless.\n\nBut given that, in the current problem, the user is presenting a series and wanting to prove its equality to a certain expression. The problem's assumptions would likely include that the series converges, and that n is a positive integer starting from 1. But the original problem doesn't state those explicitly; they are inherent in the summation notation. However, according to the example, even implicit assumptions like n being an integer are listed. So in this case, the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is a positive integer (since the sum starts at n=1)\n- The series converges (though the problem might be to evaluate it, so convergence is a prerequisite)\n\nBut maybe the problem doesn't require listing convergence as an assumption, unless it's non-trivial. Alternatively, perhaps there are no explicit assumptions beyond the terms given. Wait, looking back at the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. That seems like a mistake. Therefore, perhaps the user intended for the assistant to extract only the explicit assumptions from the problem statement, but in the example, they added an extra assumption. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example was a case where the problem had an error, and the formatted version corrected it. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants the assistant to list all mathematical conditions necessary for the problem to hold, even if they are implicit.\n\nIn the current problem, the series is sum from n=1 to infinity of sin(nπ/3)/(2n+1)^2. The problem is to prove this equals G/sqrt(3) - π²/24. The assumptions needed would be that n is a positive integer (since the sum starts at n=1 and increments by 1), and that the series is convergent. However, since the problem is to evaluate the sum, the convergence might be part of what needs to be established, but perhaps it's assumed here. Alternatively, in the context of the problem as presented, the user has already transformed an integral into this series, so maybe convergence is handled via that integral's convergence.\n\nBut according to the instructions, the assistant needs to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So, for this problem:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nthe series converges.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\sin\\left(n\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)}{(2n+1)^2} = \\frac{G}{\\sqrt{3}} - \\frac{\\pi^2}{24},$$ where \\( G \\) is Catalan's constant.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the original problem was \"for every integer n\", and the formatted problem had \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems to indicate that sometimes additional constraints are added. But in our current problem, the original question doesn't state any constraints on n beyond it being the index of summation, which is a positive integer. So maybe the only assumption is that n is a positive integer.\n\nBut perhaps there are other implicit assumptions, like the value of π/3 being in the sine function's argument, but that's part of the problem's terms, not an assumption. Alternatively, if the problem requires certain properties of the sine function or periodicity, but those are part of standard mathematics, not specific assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an assumption related to the integral approach mentioned, but the user is asking for a different method, so the integral approach is part of their attempt, not the problem's assumptions. The actual problem is just the series equality.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n\nBut in the example, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So following that pattern, here, the assumption would be n is a positive integer. However, the sum starts at n=1, so n is a positive integer by definition. But maybe it's still listed as an assumption.\n\nAdditionally, perhaps there's an assumption about the convergence of the series, but if the problem is to evaluate it, convergence is a prerequisite. However, in the example, the assumption wasn't about convergence, just about n being an integer and divisible by 7. So perhaps here, the only assumption is that n is a positive integer.\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem didn't have the assumption that n is divisible by 7. The example's formatted problem added that, which seems incorrect. Maybe that was a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the example is a different problem where the user intended to modify the original problem's conditions. This is confusing.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the safest approach is to list the assumptions that are explicitly or implicitly necessary for the problem to be valid. In this case:\n\n- n is a positive integer (since the sum starts at n=1)\n- The series converges (since we're summing to infinity)\n\nBut since the problem is to prove the sum equals a certain value, convergence is part of what needs to be established. However, the user might be assuming convergence as a given. Alternatively, in the context of the integral approach, convergence might be established through the integral's convergence. But since the user is looking for an alternative approach, maybe convergence isn't an assumption here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are no explicit assumptions beyond the problem statement. The example given in the user's instruction might have been incorrect, but following the pattern, the assistant should list the variables' conditions. In the problem, the only variable is n, which is the summation index, hence a positive integer. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\n- n is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\sin\\left(n\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)}{(2n+1)^2} = \\frac{G}{\\sqrt{3}} - \\frac{\\pi^2}{24},$$ where \\( G \\) is Catalan's constant.\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", and the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake unless the original problem had a typo. But perhaps the user wants to list all conditions on the variables. In our current problem, the variable n is bound by the summation, so it's not a free variable. Therefore, maybe there are no assumptions to list beyond the problem's inherent structure. However, the example listed assumptions even for a bound variable. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants to extract any conditions that are part of the problem's setup. Since the problem is to evaluate an infinite series, perhaps the assumption is that the series converges. But again, if the problem is to prove the sum equals a certain value, convergence is part of the proof. But maybe in some contexts, convergence is assumed.\n\nGiven the confusion from the example, perhaps the safest way is to list the variables and their conditions. Here, n is an integer greater than or equal to 1. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- n is an integer such that n ≥ 1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\sin\\left(n\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)}{(2n+1)^2} = \\frac{G}{\\sqrt{3}} - \\frac{\\pi^2}{24},$$ where \\( G \\) is Catalan's constant.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were listed as two separate lines: \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So following that style, here, the assumption would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn ≥ 1.\n\nBut since n is the index of summation starting at 1, these are inherent. However, the example included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem, which might be a mistake. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to only list the problem's given conditions. If the problem is to prove the equality, the only assumption is that the series is as defined, with n being positive integers. But since the example included \"n is an integer\" even when the problem stated \"for every integer n\", perhaps here we should similarly list \"n is a positive integer\".\n\nSo, final answer would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nn is a positive integer\nProblem: \nProve that $$\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\sin\\left(n\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)}{(2n+1)^2} = \\frac{G}{\\sqrt{3}} - \\frac{\\pi^2}{24},$$ where \\( G \\) is Catalan's constant.\n###",
