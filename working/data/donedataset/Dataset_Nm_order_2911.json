Can we prove that for every finite group $G$ there is some symmetric group $S_N$ such that $G$ is isomorphic to a $normal$ subgroup of $S_N$?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "HINT: Try to prove that for $n \\ge 5$, $A_n$, the alternating group of $n$ elements is the only proper and nontrivial normal subgroup of $S_n$. UPDATE: This has to do something with the fact that $A_n$ is simple for $n \\ge 5$. After proving this and checking the cases $n \\le 4$ we can conclude that a normal subgroup of symmetric group has order $1, 4, \\frac{n!}{2}$ or $n!$. Hence...",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem from Math Stack Exchange. The user wants to know if every finite group can be a normal subgroup of some symmetric group. The original question references Cayley's theorem, which states that any finite group G is isomorphic to a subgroup of S_N for some N. The user is asking whether this subgroup can be normal in S_N.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Cayley's theorem. It embeds G into S_N by considering the group action of G on itself via left multiplication. This action is faithful, so G is a subgroup of S_N. But the question is about being a normal subgroup. \n\nNow, normal subgroups of symmetric groups are well-understood. For S_N, the only normal subgroups when N ≥ 3 are the trivial group, A_N (the alternating group), and S_N itself. Since the user is asking about arbitrary finite groups, if G is non-trivial and not equal to A_N or S_N, then it can't be normal in S_N. For example, take G to be a cyclic group of order 2. If we embed it into S_2, it's normal because S_2 is abelian. But if we embed it into S_3, the subgroup generated by a transposition (like (1 2)) isn't normal in S_3. So the answer might depend on how we choose N and the embedding.\n\nWait, but Cayley's theorem gives a specific embedding. If we use the regular representation, then G is embedded into S_{|G|}. Is that embedding normal? Probably not. For example, take G = S_3 itself. If we embed S_3 into S_6 via the regular representation, then the image is a subgroup of S_6. But S_3 as a subgroup of S_6 under regular representation isn't normal because conjugating by elements of S_6 would mix the elements in a way that the subgroup isn't preserved unless it's trivial or the entire group.\n\nAnother angle: If G is simple, then it would need to be a normal subgroup of S_N, hence G would be a simple normal subgroup, which for symmetric groups would mean G is either A_N or trivial. But there are many finite simple groups that aren't alternating groups. So that suggests that not every finite group can be a normal subgroup of a symmetric group.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no. There exist finite groups (like non-abelian simple groups not isomorphic to A_N) which cannot be normal subgroups of any symmetric group. So the problem as posed is false. However, the user wants the problem structured according to their format, which lists assumptions and the problem. The original problem doesn't have additional assumptions beyond G being finite, so the formatted problem would just state the problem with G being finite.",
