    "Content": "I found an interesting infinite sequence recently in the form of a 'two storey continued fraction' with natural number entries: $$\\frac{e^2-3}{e^2+1}=\\cfrac{2-\\cfrac{3-\\cfrac{4-\\cdots}{4+\\cdots}}{3+\\cfrac{4-\\cdots}{4+\\cdots}}}{2+\\cfrac{3-\\cfrac{4-\\cdots}{4+\\cdots}}{3+\\cfrac{4-\\cdots}{4+\\cdots}}}$$ The numerical computation was done 'backwards', starting from some $x_n=1$ we compute: $$x_{n-1}=\\frac{a_n-x_n}{a_n+x_n}$$ And so on, until we get to $x_0$. The sequence converges for $n \\to \\infty$ if $a_n>1$ (or so it seems). For constant $a_n$ we seem to have quadratic irrationals, for example: $$\\frac{\\sqrt{17}-3}{2}=\\cfrac{2-\\cfrac{2-\\cfrac{2-\\cdots}{2+\\cdots}}{2+\\cfrac{2-\\cdots}{2+\\cdots}}}{2+\\cfrac{2-\\cfrac{2-\\cdots}{2+\\cdots}}{2+\\cfrac{2-\\cdots}{2+\\cdots}}}$$ For $a_n=2^n$ we seems to have: $$\\frac{1}{2}=\\cfrac{2-\\cfrac{4-\\cfrac{8-\\cdots}{8+\\cdots}}{4+\\cfrac{8-\\cdots}{8+\\cdots}}}{2+\\cfrac{4-\\cfrac{8-\\cdots}{8+\\cdots}}{4+\\cfrac{8-\\cdots}{8+\\cdots}}}$$ I found no other closed forms so far, and I don't know how to prove the formulas above. How can we prove them? What is known about such continued fractions? There is another curious thing. If we try to expand some number in this kind of fraction, we can do it the following way: $$x_0=x$$ $$a_0=\\left[\\frac{1}{x_0} \\right]$$ $$x_1=\\frac{1-a_0x_0}{1+a_0x_0}$$ $$a_1=\\left[\\frac{1}{x_1} \\right]$$ However, this kind of expansion will not give us the above sequences. We will get faster growing entries. Moreover, the fraction will be finite for any rational number. For example, in the list notation: $$\\frac{3}{29}=[9,28]$$ You can easily check this expansion for any rational number. As for the constant above we get: $$\\frac{e^2-3}{e^2+1}=[1,3,31,74,315,750,14286,\\dots]$$ Not the same as $[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,\\dots]$ above! We have similar sequences growing exponentially for any irrational number I checked. $$e-2=[1,6,121,284,1260,3404,25678,\\dots]$$ $$\\pi-3=[7,224,471,2195,10493,46032,119223,\\dots]$$ By the way, if we try CF convergents, we get almost the same expansion, but finite: $$\\frac{355}{113}-3=[7,225]$$ $$\\frac{4272943}{1360120}-3=[7,224,471,2195,18596,227459,\\dots]$$ So, the convergents of this sequence are not the same as for the simple continued fraction, but similar. Comparing the expansion by the method above and the closed forms at the top of the post, we can see that, unlike for simple continued fractions, this expansion is not unique. Can we explain why? Here is the Mathematica code to compute the limit of the first fraction: Nm = 50;\nCf = Table[j, {j, 1, Nm}];\nb0 = (Cf[[Nm]] - 1)/(Cf[[Nm]] + 1);\nDo[b1 = N[(Cf[[Nm - j]] - b0)/(Cf[[Nm - j]] + b0), 7500];\n b0 = b1, {j, 1, Nm - 2}]\nN[b0/Cf[[1]], 50] And here is the code to obtain the expansion in the usual way: x = (E^2 - 3)/(E^2 + 1);\nx0 = x;\nNm = 27;\nCf = Table[1, {j, 1, Nm}];\nDo[If[x0 != 0, a = Floor[1/x0];\n  x1 = N[(1 - x0 a)/(x0 a + 1), 19500];\n  Print[j, \" \", a, \" \", N[x1, 16]];\n  Cf[[j]] = a;\n  x0 = x1], {j, 1, Nm}]\nb0 = (1 - 1/Cf[[Nm]])/(1 + 1/Cf[[Nm]]);\nDo[b1 = N[(1 - b0/Cf[[Nm - j]])/(1 + b0/Cf[[Nm - j]]), 7500];\n b0 = b1, {j, 1, Nm - 2}]\nN[x - b0/Cf[[1]], 20] Update I have derived the forward recurrence relations for numerator and denominator: $$p_{n+1}=(a_n-1)p_n+2a_{n-1}p_{n-1}$$ $$q_{n+1}=(a_n-1)q_n+2a_{n-1}q_{n-1}$$ They have the same form as for generalized continued fractions (a special case). Now I understand why the expansions are not unique.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question according to the specified structure. The original question is quite lengthy with multiple parts, so I need to filter out the unrelated information and focus on the core problem.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the question carefully. The main problem seems to be proving that the expression (e² - 3)/(e² + 1) equals a specific continued fraction structure they provided. They also mentioned other examples with closed forms, like the one with a_n being constants leading to quadratic irrationals and another with a_n = 2^n resulting in 1/2. However, the primary focus is on proving the initial formula involving e².\n\nThe user also talks about an expansion method that doesn't yield the same sequence as the continued fraction presented, leading to questions about uniqueness and alternative expansions. But the key problem here is the proof of the given continued fraction representation for (e² - 3)/(e² + 1). The assumptions need to be extracted from the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the example provided in the original query, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. In the given problem, the user mentions that the sequence converges for n → ∞ if a_n > 1. However, in the specific case they want to prove, the entries of the continued fraction are natural numbers in a \"two storey\" structure. The sequence a_n here seems to be the natural numbers starting from 2, i.e., a_n = n+1 for n ≥ 1, as the continued fraction starts with 2, then 3, 4, etc. But the user didn't explicitly state that a_n follows this sequence, so maybe that's an assumption. Also, the convergence condition a_n > 1 is mentioned, which applies here since a_n are natural numbers greater than 1.\n\nAnother part is the method of computation: starting from x_n = 1 and computing backwards using x_{n-1} = (a_n - x_n)/(a_n + x_n). So the assumptions would include that the continued fraction is constructed in this backward manner with x_n = 1 initially, and each a_n is a natural number greater than 1. Also, the problem statement refers to this specific structure as a 'two storey continued fraction' with natural number entries, so that's part of the setup.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should cover:\n\n1. The continued fraction is constructed backward starting from x_n = 1.\n2. Each term a_n is a natural number greater than 1.\n3. The recursion formula x_{n-1} = (a_n - x_n)/(a_n + x_n) is used.\n4. The sequence of a_n in the given continued fraction is 2, 3, 4, ... (natural numbers starting from 2).\n\nBut wait, the problem statement says \"with natural number entries\" which implies each a_n is a natural number. Also, the convergence condition is mentioned when a_n > 1. So the key assumptions would be:\n\n- The continued fraction is constructed using the backward recursion x_{n-1} = (a_n - x_n)/(a_n + x_n).\n- Each a_n is a natural number greater than 1.\n- The initial term x_n = 1 as n approaches infinity.\n- The entries a_n follow the sequence 2, 3, 4, ... (i.e., a_n = n+1 for each level of the continued fraction).\n\nBut the problem specifically states \"for the first fraction\", which is the one involving e². However, the user's question is about proving that (e² -3)/(e² +1) equals the given continued fraction. The assumptions here are the conditions under which this equality holds. Since the user constructed the continued fraction with a_n = n+1 (starting from 2), and using the backward recursion starting from x_n=1, those are the key assumptions.\n\nSo, structuring this:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- The continued fraction is constructed backward starting from x_n = 1 as n approaches infinity.\n- Each entry a_n in the continued fraction is a natural number greater than 1.\n- The sequence of entries a_n is 2, 3, 4, ..., increasing by 1 at each level.\n- The recursion relation x_{k-1} = (a_k - x_k)/(a_k + x_k) is used for each step.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$\\frac{e^2-3}{e^2+1} = \\cfrac{2-\\cfrac{3-\\cfrac{4-\\cdots}{4+\\cdots}}{3+\\cfrac{4-\\cdots}{4+\\cdots}}}{2+\\cfrac{3-\\cfrac{4-\\cdots}{4+\\cdots}}{3+\\cfrac{4-\\cdots}{4+\\cdots}}}$$.\n\nI need to list each assumption on a separate line, each addressing one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe continued fraction is constructed using backward recursion starting from $x_n = 1$ as $n \\to \\infty$,\nEach entry $a_n$ in the continued fraction is a natural number,\nEach entry $a_n$ satisfies $a_n > 1$,\nThe sequence of entries $a_n$ is $2, 3, 4, \\dots$ (i.e., $a_n = n + 1$),\nThe recursion relation $x_{k-1} = \\frac{a_k - x_k}{a_k + x_k}$ is applied at each step.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$\\frac{e^2 - 3}{e^2 + 1}$$ equals the given continued fraction expression.\n\nBut wait, the original problem includes other parts like explaining why expansions aren't unique and what's known about such continued fractions, but the user's main request is to structure the problem according to the example. The example only included the problem and assumptions, filtering out other discussions. So the core problem is proving the equality for the e² expression. The other parts (like non-uniqueness, comparison with other expansions) are additional questions but maybe not the main focus here. The user also asks \"How can we prove them?\" referring to the formulas above, including the ones for quadratic irrationals and 1/2, but the main focus is the first one with e².\n\nThus, the formatted problem should focus on proving the given continued fraction equals (e² -3)/(e² +1) under the stated assumptions.",
