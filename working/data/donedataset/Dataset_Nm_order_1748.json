    "Content": "The following result matches very good numerically: \n$$\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(3n+1)^3}=\\frac{13}{27}\\zeta(3)+\\frac{2\\pi^3}{81\\sqrt{3}}.$$\nThough I'm not sure how to approach this. How can we prove it? Also, is it possible to find closed form for $$\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(3n+1)^5}$$ or the like?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $$S_1=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(3n+1)^3} ,S_2=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(3n+2)^3}.$$\nIt's easily seen that $$S_1+S_2+\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{(3n)^3}=\\zeta(3).$$\nThat is, $$S_1+S_2=\\zeta(3)-\\frac{1}{27}\\zeta(3)=\\frac{26}{27}\\zeta(3)\\tag{1}$$\nHowever, $$S_1-S_2=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(3n+1)^3}-\\frac{1}{(3n+2)^3}=\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(3n+1)^3}=\\frac{4\\pi^3}{81\\sqrt{3}}\\tag{2}$$ To calculate $(2)$, consider the Weierstrass form of the sinc function $$\\frac{\\sin x}{x}=\\prod\\limits_{n=1}^\\infty\\left(1-\\frac{x^2}{\\pi^2 n^2}\\right)$$\nand take $\\frac{d^3}{dx^3}\\log(\\cdot)$ of both sides.\nSet $x=\\frac{\\pi}{3}.$ Update. I found that this question has been already asked here, so I link these two: Sum related to zeta function Also, I give an alternative way to calculate $(2)$. Notice that\n$$\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\,\\sin\\left( \\frac{2 \\pi n}{3} \\right) =\\begin{cases} 0 & n\\equiv 0 \\\\ 1 & n\\equiv 1 \\\\ -1 & n\\equiv 2\n\\end{cases} \\pmod{3}.$$\nTherefore $$S_1 - S_2 =\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\sin(2\\pi n/3)}{n^3}. \\tag{3}$$ Finally, $(2)$ follows from the Fourier expansion $$ \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\sin(2 \\pi x n)}{n^3}=\\frac{\\pi^3}{3}\\left( \\{x\\}-3\\{x\\}^2+2\\{x\\}^3\\right), \\tag{4}$$ where $\\,\\{x\\}$ is the fractional part of $x$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem properly. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into their specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should list each condition one by one, applied to a single object. The problem statement should then be concise.\n\nLooking at the original problem here, the title is about the sum of a series from n=0 to infinity of 1/(3n+1)^3. The user mentions a specific result they want to prove and asks about higher powers like (3n+1)^5.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The series is summed from n=0 to infinity, so the index n starts at 0. The general term is 1/(3n+1)^3, so each term is the reciprocal of a cubic expression linear in n with coefficient 3 and constant term 1. The problem is to prove the given closed-form expression involving the Riemann zeta function and pi cubed over sqrt(3). Additionally, the user is asking about generalizing this to higher powers, specifically fifth power.\n\nBut according to the example, assumptions are conditions or properties applied to one object each. In the example, they listed that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, the main assumptions are about the series structure. So each part of the series definition should be an assumption. Let's break it down:\n\nAssumption 1: The summation is over n starting from 0 to infinity.\n\nAssumption 2: Each term of the series is 1/(3n + 1)^3.\n\nThe problem is to prove the given equality involving zeta(3) and pi^3. Also, the second part is about finding a closed form for the fifth power. However, in the example, the problem was focused on the main question, and the additional question about higher powers was included in the problem statement. So here, perhaps the problem statement should include both proving the given sum and whether a closed form exists for the fifth power.\n\nWait, the example had the problem part as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" even though the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7. So in that case, the assumptions were about n's properties. Here, the problem is about the sum, so the assumptions would be the parameters of the sum. Therefore:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- The series is $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(3n+1)^3}$.\n\nBut the example structured each assumption line by line. Each assumption addresses one property. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption 1: The summation index n starts at 0 and goes to infinity.\n\nAssumption 2: Each term of the series is 1 divided by (3n + 1) cubed.\n\nBut maybe even more granular. For example, in the original example, the assumption was n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So each line is a separate condition on the same object. Here, maybe:\n\n- The series is a sum from n = 0 to ∞.\n\n- Each term in the series is of the form 1/(3n + 1)^3.\n\nBut in the example, they didn't split the components of the expression. They listed the two conditions on n. Here, perhaps the problem is to prove that sum equals that expression, so the assumptions are the structure of the sum. So maybe:\n\nAssumption 1: The series is defined as the sum from n = 0 to ∞.\n\nAssumption 2: The general term of the series is 1/(3n + 1)^3.\n\nProblem: Prove that the sum equals the given expression and whether closed forms exist for higher powers like fifth.\n\nBut the user's example included two assumptions on n. Here, the problem's assumptions are about the series' structure, so each part (summation range, term) is an assumption. Then the problem is to prove the equality and investigate higher powers.\n\nBut the original problem also mentions that the result matches numerically, so the user is confident in the result but wants a proof. So perhaps the problem is to prove the given equality and explore generalizations. The example included the additional question in the problem statement. So following that, the problem part should include both the proof and the question about higher powers.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have assumptions about the series structure, then the problem as proving the equality and whether higher powers can be expressed similarly.\n\nLet me check the example again. The original problem had A(n) defined with 5^n terms, and the formatted problem had assumptions about n being integer and divisible by 7. The problem was to prove divisibility by 91. Here, the problem is about a series sum. So assumptions would be the parameters of the series. But how to split them into separate lines? Maybe:\n\nAssumption: The series is $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(3n+1)^3}$.\n\nBut the example had two assumptions for two conditions on n. Here, maybe the series is over n starting at 0, and the term is 1/(3n+1)^3. But maybe that's two separate assumptions. So:\n\nAssumption: The summation index n starts at 0.\n\nAssumption: The summation index n goes to infinity.\n\nAssumption: Each term in the series is 1/(3n + 1)^3.\n\nBut that seems too granular. Alternatively, the first assumption is the series is from n=0 to infinity, and the second is the general term. The problem is to prove the sum equals the expression and whether higher powers can be expressed similarly.\n\nAlternatively, since the example had two assumptions (n integer, n divisible by 7), here maybe:\n\nAssumption: The series is summed over all integers n ≥ 0.\n\nAssumption: Each term of the series is 1/(3n + 1)^3.\n\nProblem: Prove that the sum equals (13/27)ζ(3) + (2π³)/(81√3), and determine if a closed form exists for the sum with terms 1/(3n+1)^5.\n\nYes, that seems right. Each assumption is a single condition. The first is about the summation range (n from 0 to ∞), the second about the term's form. Then the problem is to prove the given equality and inquire about higher exponents.\n\nBut in the example, the problem part was only the main question. The original problem here also asks about higher powers. So maybe the problem should include both parts.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe series is summed over all integers n ≥ 0,\nEach term of the series is 1/(3n + 1)^3.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(3n+1)^3} = \\frac{13}{27}\\zeta(3) + \\frac{2\\pi^3}{81\\sqrt{3}},$$ and determine if a closed form exists for $$\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(3n+1)^5}.$$\n\nBut perhaps each assumption line is separate, even if they refer to the same object. For example, in the example, n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Here, the series is summed over n ≥0, and each term is 1/(3n+1)^3. So two separate assumptions. Then the problem is to prove the sum equals that expression and also ask about higher powers.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the final answer should be structured as such.",
