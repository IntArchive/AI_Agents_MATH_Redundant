    "Content": "Let $f \\ge 0$ , $f\\in L^1(0,1)$ , monotone decrease. Suppose $\\forall a,x \\in (0,1) $ such that $0<x-a<x+a<1$ , $$\\int_{x-a}^x f(t)dt<\\frac{5}{4} \\int_{x}^{x+a}f(t)dt.$$ Prove $f\\in L^p(0,1)$ , $\\forall 1\\le p\\le \\frac{\\ln 2}{\\ln 3-\\ln 2}$ . I can get a weaker bound $1\\le p<\\frac{\\ln 2}{\\ln25 - \\ln16}$ by dividing the interval of integration by $[2^{-n},2^{-n+1}]$ and getting $f(2^{-n})<\\frac{25}{16}f(2^{-n+1})$ , but I don't know how to get a finer bound. My attempt, $$\n2^{-n}f(2^{-n})<\\int_0^{2^{-n}} f(t)dt<\\frac{5}{4}\\int_{2^{-n}} ^{2^{-n+1}} f(t)dt<\\frac{25}{16}\\int_{2^{-n+1}} ^{2^{-n+2}} f(t)dt<2^{-n}f(2^{-n+1}),\n$$ thus, $$f(2^{-n})<\\frac{25}{16}f(2^{-n+1})<\\left(\\frac{25}{16}\\right)^nf(1).$$ Then, $$\n\\int_0^1 f(t)^p<\\sum_{n=0}^{+\\infty}2^{-n}f(2^{-n})^p<f(1)^p\\sum_{n=0}^{+\\infty}\\left(\\frac{25}{16}\\right)^{np}\\cdot2^{-n},\n$$ if $\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{25}{16}\\right)^p<1$ , we can get $\\int_0^1 f(t)^p<+\\infty$ .",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If we follow OP's idea, the issue seems is at the last step of $$x f(x) \\le \\int_{0}^x f(t) dt \\le A\\int_{x}^{2x} f(t) dt \\le A^2 \\int_{2x}^{3x} f(t) dt$$ where $A = \\frac{5}{4}$ . This step relaxes too much. Since the inequality is applied twice. So maybe a good strategy is to use once. That is $$ \\int_{0}^x f(t) dt \\le A\\int_{x}^{2x} f(t) dt \\le A x f(x). $$ While the LHS is $$ \\int_{0}^x f(t) dt = \\int_{0}^{x/2} f(t) dt + \\int_{x/2}^x f(t) dt \\ge \\frac{x}{2} f(\\frac{x}{2}) + \\frac{x}{2} f(x) $$ Therefore $$(2 A - 1) f(x) \\ge f(\\frac{x}{2})$$ which means $$\\frac{3}{2} f(x) \\ge f(\\frac{x}{2}). $$ Then follow OP's steps, it is done. Followup. To find a better $p$ , one can set $$ \\int_{0}^x f(t) dt = \\int_{0}^{\\beta x/2} f(t) dt + \\int_{\\beta x/2}^x f(t) dt \\ge \\frac{\\beta x}{2} f(\\frac{\\beta x}{2}) + (1-\\frac{\\beta}{2})x f(x) $$ Thus $$\\left(A - 1 +\\frac{\\beta}{2}\\right) f(x) \\ge \\frac{\\beta}{2} f(\\frac{\\beta x}{2})$$ then convergence means $$\\left|\\frac{2A - 2 + \\beta}{\\beta}\\right|^p \\frac{\\beta}{2} < 1\\Rightarrow p < \\frac{\\log(2/\\beta)}{\\log(0.5+\\beta)/\\beta}$$ The maximum is at $\\beta = 0.5$ (because of this :)) which makes $p < 2$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. First, I need to read through the original question on Math Stack Exchange carefully and extract all the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe title is \"How to prove $f \\in L^p(0,1)$\". The question starts by stating that $f \\ge 0$, $f \\in L^1(0,1)$, and that $f$ is monotone decreasing. Then, there's a condition given for all $a, x \\in (0,1)$ such that $0 < x - a < x + a < 1$, the integral of $f$ from $x - a$ to $x$ is less than (5/4) times the integral from $x$ to $x + a$. The goal is to prove that $f$ is in $L^p(0,1)$ for all $1 \\le p \\le \\frac{\\ln 2}{\\ln 3 - \\ln 2}$.\n\nThe user also mentions their attempt, where they derived a weaker bound using intervals divided as $[2^{-n}, 2^{-n+1}]$ and obtained a relation involving $f(2^{-n})$ and $f(2^{-n+1})$, leading to a geometric series condition. However, this part seems to be their attempt and not part of the problem's original assumptions. So I should filter that out.\n\nNow, breaking down the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object:\n\n1. $f \\ge 0$: The function is non-negative.\n2. $f \\in L^1(0,1)$: The function is integrable on the interval (0,1).\n3. $f$ is monotone decreasing: The function decreases monotonically.\n4. For all $a, x \\in (0,1)$ with $0 < x - a < x + a < 1$, the integral condition holds: $\\int_{x-a}^x f(t)dt < \\frac{5}{4} \\int_x^{x+a} f(t)dt$.\n\nThe problem is to prove that $f \\in L^p(0,1)$ for all $p$ in the specified range. The user's attempt with the intervals and the bound they mention (like the 25/16 ratio) is part of their solution attempt and not part of the problem's given conditions, so those shouldn't be included in the assumptions.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is a single line, each applying to one object. Let me check again:\n\n- First three points are clear: non-negativity, L^1 membership, monotonicity.\n- The fourth assumption is the integral inequality for all valid a and x. The original condition uses \"∀ a,x ∈ (0,1)\" with the constraints on x and a. So this should be stated as a separate assumption.\n\nPutting it all together, the Assumption section should list these four points. Then the Problem section states the required proof.",
