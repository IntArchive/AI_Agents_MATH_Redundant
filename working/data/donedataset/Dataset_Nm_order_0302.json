    "Content": "Question A lot of things I'm trying to prove just now are turning into \"notational hell\", which I think makes them very hard to read. I've tried to cut down on this by assuming my reader will understand what definitions are in play, modularising my proofs and skipping explanation of steps that I hope are obvious. I've also tried relabeling formulae with short names (i.e., $\\def\\val#1{V_\\pli(#1)}\\def\\p{\\phi}\\def\\q{\\psi}\\def\\s{\\vDash_{\\tiny\\text{PL}}}\\def\\ns{\\nvDash_{\\tiny\\text{PL}}}\\def\\pli{\\mathscr{I}}\\def\\aa{\\p_1,\\,\\p_2,\\,\\ldots,\\,\\p_n\\s\\q}\\def\\ab{\\p_1,\\,\\p_2,\\,\\ldots,\\,\\p_n\\ns\\q}\\def\\ba{\\s\\p_n\\to(\\p_{n-1}\\to(\\cdots\\to(\\p_1\\to\\q)\\cdots))}\\def\\bb{\\ns\\p_n\\to(\\p_{n-1}\\to(\\cdots\\to(\\p_1\\to\\q)\\cdots))}\\s\\p_n\\to(\\p_{n-1}\\to(\\cdots\\to(\\p_1\\to\\q)\\cdots)):=\\,\\s Q),$ but for proofs of any length it seems to be more confusing than helpful. How do I make proofs more readable without sacrificing clarity? Example Proof Let $\\p$ and $\\q$ be wffs and $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ (please note that $0\\not\\in\\mathbb{N}$ ). We want to show $\\def\\p{\\phi}\\def\\q{\\psi}\\def\\s{\\vDash_{\\tiny\\text{PL}}}\\def\\ns{\\nvDash_{\\tiny\\text{PL}}}\\p_1,\\,\\p_2,\\,\\ldots,\\,\\p_n\\s\\q$ iff $\\s\\p_n\\to(\\p_{n-1}\\to(\\cdots\\to(\\p_1\\to\\q)\\cdots))$ . In (L1) I prove both directions of the biconditional, which I don't think I need to do because we're dealing with \"=\" - is this correct? I also think that (L1) is so basic that \"by inspection\" is appropriate - is that fair? Lemma 1 (L1) We want to show by induction that for some PL-interpretation, $\\pli,$ $\\val{\\p_n\\to(\\p_{n-1}\\to(\\cdots\\to(\\p_1\\to\\q)\\cdots))}=0$ iff $\\val{\\p_n}=\\val{\\p_{n-1}}=\\cdots=\\val{\\p_1}=1$ and $\\val{\\q}=0$ . Base Case If $\\val{\\p\\to\\q}=0$ then, by definition, $\\val{\\p}=1$ and $\\val{\\q}=0$ . If $\\val{\\p}=1$ and $\\val{\\q}=0$ , then, by definition, $\\val{\\p\\to\\q}=0$ Induction Hypothesis (IH) Assume for some arbitrary $k\\in\\mathbb{N}$ that $\\val{p_k\\to(\\p_{k-1}\\to(\\cdots\\to(\\p_1\\to\\q)\\cdots))}=0$ and $\\val{\\p_k}=\\val{\\p_{k-1}}=\\cdots=\\val{\\p_1}=1$ and $\\val{\\q}=0$ Induction Step If $\\val{\\p_{k+1}\\to(p_k\\to(\\p_{k-1}\\to(\\cdots\\to(\\p_1\\to\\q)\\cdots)))}=0,$ then, as we know $\\val{p_k\\to(\\p_{k-1}\\to(\\cdots\\to(\\p_1\\to\\q)\\cdots))}=0$ from the (IH), $\\val{\\p_{k+1}}=1$ . From the (IH) $\\val{\\p_k}=\\val{\\p_{k-1}}=\\cdots=\\val{\\p_1}=1$ and $\\val{\\q}=0$ , thus $\\val{\\p_{k+1}}=\\val{\\p_k}=\\val{\\p_{k-1}}=\\cdots=\\val{\\p_1}=1$ and $\\val{\\q}=0$ Let $\\val{\\p_{k+1}}=1$ . From the (IH) $\\val{\\p_k}=\\val{\\p_{k-1}}=\\cdots=\\val{\\p_1}=1,$ $\\val{\\q}=0,$ and $\\val{p_k\\to(\\p_{k-1}\\to(\\cdots\\to(\\p_1\\to\\q)\\cdots))}=0,$ thus $\\val{\\p_{k+1}\\to(p_k\\to(\\p_{k-1}\\to(\\cdots\\to(\\p_1\\to\\q)\\cdots)))}=0$ Proof of First Direction (P1) For reductio, suppose it is not the case that $\\aa\\implies\\ba$ It follows from (1) that there exists an $\\def\\pli{\\mathscr{I}}\\pli$ such that $\\def\\aa{\\p_1,\\,\\p_2,\\,\\ldots,\\,\\p_n\\s\\q}\\def\\ab{\\p_1,\\,\\p_2,\\,\\ldots,\\,\\p_n\\ns\\q}\\def\\ba{\\s\\p_n\\to(\\p_{n-1}\\to(\\cdots\\to(\\p_1\\to\\q)\\cdots))}\\def\\bb{\\ns\\p_n\\to(\\p_{n-1}\\to(\\cdots\\to(\\p_1\\to\\q)\\cdots))}\\aa$ and $\\bb$ It follows from (2) that $\\def\\val#1{V_\\pli(#1)}\\val{\\p_n\\to(\\p_{n-1}\\to(\\cdots\\to(\\p_1\\to\\q)\\cdots))}=0$ From (L1), the valuation on (3) can only occur when $\\val{\\p_n}=\\val{\\p_{n-1}}=\\cdots=\\val{\\p_1}=1$ and $\\val{\\q}=0$ It follows from (4) that $\\ab$ , which contradicts (2) and proves our first direction Proof of Second Direction (P2) For reductio, suppose it's not the case that $\\ba\\implies\\aa$ It follows from (1) that there exists an $\\pli$ such that $\\ba\\text{ and }\\ab$ From (2) we have $\\ab$ , thus, $\\val{\\p_n}=\\val{\\p_{n-1}}=\\cdots=\\val{\\p_1}=1$ and $\\val{\\q}=0$ It follows from (3) and (L1) that $\\bb\\text{,}$ which contradicts (2) and proves our second direction (P1) and (P2) prove both directions of the biconditional, hence $\\def\\p{\\phi}\\def\\q{\\psi}\\def\\s{\\vDash_{\\tiny\\text{PL}}}\\def\\ns{\\nvDash_{\\tiny\\text{PL}}}\\p_1,\\,\\p_2,\\,\\ldots,\\,\\p_n\\s\\q$ iff $\\s\\p_n\\to(\\p_{n-1}\\to(\\cdots\\to(\\p_1\\to\\q)\\cdots))\\,\\square.$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Main suggestion Instead of We want to show $\\def\\p{\\phi}\\def\\q{\\psi}\\def\\s{\\vDash_{\\tiny\\text{PL}}}\\def\\ns{\\nvDash_{\\tiny\\text{PL}}}\\p_1,\\,\\p_2,\\,\\ldots,\\,\\p_n\\s\\q$ iff $\\s\\p_n\\to(\\p_{n-1}\\to(\\cdots\\to(\\p_1\\to\\q)\\cdots))$ try it like this: We want to show that $$\\def\\p{\\phi}\\def\\q{\\psi}\\def\\s{\\vDash_{\\tiny\\text{PL}}}\\def\\ns{\\nvDash_{\\tiny\\text{PL}}}\\p_1,\\,\\p_2,\\,\\ldots,\\,\\p_n\\s\\q \\tag{1}$$ if and only if $$\\s\\p_n\\to(\\p_{n-1}\\to(\\cdots\\to(\\p_1\\to\\q)\\cdots)).\\tag{2}$$ After that, instead of repeating the long formulas every time, just call them $(1)$ and $(2)$ : For reductio, suppose it's not the case that $(2)\\implies (1)$ .  Then there must exist an $\\mathscr I$ such that $(2)$ holds but $(1)$ does not. Lesser suggestions Abbreviate $$\\phi_n\\to(\\phi_{n-1}\\to(\\cdots\\to(\\phi_1\\to\\q)\\cdots))$$ as $$\\Phi_n.$$ (Don't use $Q$ .  Why would you use $Q$ ?) Instead of $$V_\\mathscr{I}({p_k\\to(\\p_{k-1}\\to(\\cdots\\to(\\p_1\\to\\q)\\cdots))})=0$$ you can now write $$V_\\mathscr{I}({p_k\\to\\Phi_{k-1}})=0$$ and the reader won't miss that the first variable is a $p$ and not a $\\phi$ . You said abbreviating seems “more confusing than helpful”.  It's not. Abbreviate $\\phi_1,\\phi_2,\\ldots,\\phi_n$ as $\\vec\\phi$ . Abbreviate $$V_\\mathscr{I}(\\phi_n)=V_\\mathscr{I}(\\phi_{n-1})=\\cdots=V_\\mathscr{I}(\\phi_1)=1$$ as $$V_\\mathscr{I}(\\phi_i) = 1\\quad (i=1\\ldots n)$$ or perhaps $$V_\\mathscr{I}(\\phi_{1\\ldots n}) = 1.$$ You're abbreviating the wrong things.  You don't need to abbreviate “if and only if” as “iff”, or “Lemma 1” as “L1”. The goal here is not to remove all the normal English from your proof.  These abbreviations are more confusing than helpful. Don't make the reader compare two long formulas to make sure they are the same, or to wonder why they are not.  Design your notation to highlight the differences between similar formulas. Notation, like language, is flexible. There are no rules; you are allowed to make things up. $\\vec\\phi$ is not really a vector.  It doesn't matter. You can explain it briefly: “We will abbreviate $\\phi_1,\\phi_2,\\ldots,\\phi_n$ as $\\vec\\phi$ .”  Nobody will be confused or forget what it means.  My suggestion $V_\\mathscr{I}(\\phi_{1\\ldots n})$ is not standard.  It doesn't matter; the meaning is clear. Orthogonal suggestions You're not using TeX correctly.  You don't need to keep repeating \\def s.  Once you \\def a new control sequence, the definition remains in force until the end of the group, or the document.  Define the important macros once, at the beginning of the file, or in an \\include d file. Define better macros.  The structure of the macros should follow the syntactic structure of your formulas.  Instead of typing out \\def\\aa{\\p_1,\\,\\p_2,\\,\\ldots,\\,\\p_n\\s\\q}\n\\def\\ab{\\p_1,\\,\\p_2,\\,\\ldots,\\,\\p_n\\ns\\q}\n\\def\\ba{\\s\\p_n\\to(\\p_{n-1}\\to(\\cdots\\to(\\p_1\\to\\q)\\cdots))}  \n\\def\\bb{\\ns\\p_n\\to(\\p_{n-1}\\to(\\cdots\\to(\\p_1\\to\\q)\\cdots)) try it this way: \\def\\ps{\\p_1,\\,\\p_2,\\,\\ldots,\\,\\p_n}\n\\def\\aa{\\ps\\s\\psi}\n\\def\\ab{\\ps\\ns\\psi}\n\\def\\pformn{\\p_n\\to(\\p_{n-1}\\to(\\cdots\\to(\\p_1\\to\\psi)\\cdots))}\n% now you don't need \\ba or \\bb, just use \\s\\pformn and \\ns\\pformn",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants me to act as a math professor and structure a problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The example given shows that the original problem might have extra information, and the task is to filter out the unrelated parts and list assumptions clearly, each addressing one property or condition for one object. Then, state the problem concisely.\n\nLooking at the provided example, the original problem was about proving that a certain expression A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. However, in the formatted version, the assumption includes that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the user didn't mention n being divisible by 7. Hmm, maybe the example had a mistake? Or perhaps the original problem was edited. Wait, the example says \"Original problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Maybe the example is incorrect? Or maybe there was a typo. Maybe the original problem actually had the condition that n is divisible by 7, but in the example, it's presented as \"for every integer n\", which would make the added assumption incorrect. That's confusing. Maybe the example is illustrative but not accurate. I need to proceed carefully.\n\nNow, looking at the current problem. The user provided a question from Math Stack Exchange titled \"How do I make proofs with long formulae more readable without sacrificing clarity?\" The question is about dealing with notational complexity in proofs. The user included a detailed example proof involving propositional logic, lemmas, and induction. The task is to extract the problem part and list the assumptions.\n\nSo first, I need to parse through the question to find the actual mathematical problem being discussed, separate from the proof-writing advice. The example proof is part of the user's question, but they are asking about how to structure proofs, not about solving that specific lemma. However, in the example, the user structures a problem from an original question. So in this case, the actual mathematical problem that needs to be formatted is the lemma they are trying to prove in their example proof.\n\nLooking at the example proof provided in the question, the user states: \"We want to show that for some PL-interpretation, ℑ, V_ℑ(φ_n → (φ_{n−1} → (⋯ → (φ_1 → ψ)⋯))) = 0 iff V_ℑ(φ_n) = V_ℑ(φ_{n−1}) = ⋯ = V_ℑ(φ_1) = 1 and V_ℑ(ψ) = 0.\" Then they go on to prove this by induction.\n\nSo the actual mathematical problem here is Lemma 1 (L1) that they mention. The assumptions would relate to the definitions in play here: propositional logic interpretations, valuations, etc. But according to the example given earlier, the assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nFirst, let's identify the assumptions inherent in the problem. The problem is about PL (Propositional Logic) interpretations and valuations. The lemma is about the valuation of a nested implication formula being 0 if and only if all the antecedents are 1 and the consequent is 0.\n\nThe assumptions here are:\n\n1. The context is propositional logic.\n2. There is a PL-interpretation ℑ.\n3. The valuation function V_ℑ assigns truth values to formulas.\n4. The formulas φ_1, φ_2, ..., φ_n and ψ are well-formed formulas (wffs) of propositional logic.\n5. The natural number n is in ℕ, and 0 ∉ ℕ (as per the note in the example proof).\n6. The implication operator → is defined such that V_ℑ(φ → ψ) = 0 iff V_ℑ(φ) = 1 and V_ℑ(ψ) = 0.\n\nEach of these should be an assumption. However, according to the example format, each assumption is a single line addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So let's break them down:\n\n1. ℑ is a PL-interpretation.\n2. V_ℑ is a valuation function for ℑ.\n3. φ_1, φ_2, ..., φ_n are wffs of propositional logic.\n4. ψ is a wff of propositional logic.\n5. n is a natural number (n ∈ ℕ).\n6. 0 is not an element of ℕ (as per the user's note, though this might be a side note, but since it's specified, perhaps include it).\n7. The implication φ → ψ has valuation 0 iff φ is 1 and ψ is 0.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the key assumption is about how the implication is defined. The lemma is about the valuation of the nested implication being 0 iff all antecedents are 1 and consequent is 0. The induction proof relies on the base case of a single implication, then building up.\n\nBut perhaps the main assumptions needed for the problem are:\n\n- The valuation function for implication is defined such that V(φ → ψ) = 0 if and only if V(φ) = 1 and V(ψ) = 0.\n- The natural number n is at least 1 (since they mention φ_1 to φ_n, and n ∈ ℕ with 0 ∉ ℕ, so n ≥ 1).\n- Each φ_i and ψ are wffs.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions are listed as individual lines. Let me look again at the example. In the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem included an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but that contradicts the original problem. Unless there was a mistake in the example. Maybe the user intended that the original problem had n divisible by 7 as a condition, but in the example, they wrote \"for every integer n\", which would be incorrect. Perhaps there was an error in the example. But regardless, for the current problem, I need to focus on the lemma presented in the user's example proof.\n\nSo the problem is: Show that for a PL-interpretation ℑ, the valuation of the nested implication φ_n → (φ_{n−1} → (⋯ → (φ_1 → ψ)⋯)) is 0 if and only if all φ_i are 1 and ψ is 0.\n\nThe assumptions would include:\n\n- ℑ is a PL-interpretation.\n- V_ℑ is the valuation function corresponding to ℑ.\n- Each φ_i (for i from 1 to n) and ψ are wffs.\n- n is a natural number (n ∈ ℕ, with 0 ∉ ℕ).\n- The valuation of an implication φ → ψ is 0 iff φ is 1 and ψ is 0.\n\nBut per the example format, each assumption is a separate line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo breaking it down:\n\nAssumption:\n- ℑ is a propositional logic interpretation.\n- V_ℑ(φ) is the truth value of formula φ under ℑ.\n- φ_1, φ_2, ..., φ_n are propositional formulas.\n- ψ is a propositional formula.\n- n is a positive integer.\n- For any formulas φ and ψ, V_ℑ(φ → ψ) = 0 if and only if V_ℑ(φ) = 1 and V_ℑ(ψ) = 0.\n\nBut maybe some of these can be combined. However, the example had two separate assumptions: \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". So each assumption is one line, one condition per line, even if related.\n\nTherefore, in this case, for the problem of proving the lemma, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- ℑ is a propositional logic interpretation.\n- φ_1, φ_2, ..., φ_n are propositional well-formed formulas.\n- ψ is a propositional well-formed formula.\n- n is a positive integer (since n ∈ ℕ and 0 ∉ ℕ).\n- For any propositional formulas φ and ψ, V_ℑ(φ → ψ) = 0 if and only if V_ℑ(φ) = 1 and V_ℑ(ψ) = 0.\n\nEach of these is a separate line. The problem statement is then to show that V_ℑ(φ_n → (φ_{n−1} → (... → (φ_1 → ψ)...)) = 0 if and only if V_ℑ(φ_1) = V_ℑ(φ_2) = ... = V_ℑ(φ_n) = 1 and V_ℑ(ψ) = 0.\n\nWait, but the user's lemma states: \"We want to show by induction that for some PL-interpretation, ℑ, V_ℑ(φ_n → (φ_{n−1} → (⋯ → (φ_1 → ψ)⋯))) = 0 iff V_ℑ(φ_n) = V_ℑ(φ_{n−1}) = ⋯ = V_ℑ(φ_1) = 1 and V_ℑ(ψ) = 0.\"\n\nSo the problem is to show that equivalence. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumptions are as listed above, and the problem is to prove that the valuation of the nested implication is 0 iff all antecedents are 1 and consequent is 0.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have assumptions about the interpretation, the formulas, n being a positive integer, and the definition of implication valuation. Then the problem is the biconditional statement about the nested implication's valuation.",
