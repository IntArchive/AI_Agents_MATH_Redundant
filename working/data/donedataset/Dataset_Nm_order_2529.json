    "Content": "We are given the Sylvester equation $AX+XB=C$ with complex matrices. I am trying to understand the proof that if $A$ and $-B$ share no eigenvalues, then there is a unique solution $X$ for any $C$. The proof is on Wikipedia and reads like this: Suppose that $A$ and $-B$ have no common eigenvalues. Then their characteristic polynomials $f(z)$ and $g(z)$ have highest common factor $1$. Hence there exist complex polynomials $p(z)$ and $q(z)$ such that $p(z)f(z)+q(z)g(z)=1$. By the Cayley–Hamilton theorem, $f(A)=0=g(-B)$; hence $g(A)q(A)=I$. Let $X$ be any solution of $S(X)=0$; so $AX=-XB$ and repeating this one sees that $X=q(A)g(A)X=q(A)Xg(-B)=0$. Hence by the rank plus nullity theorem $S$ is invertible, so for all $C$ there exists a unique solution $X$. Firstly, I don't understand how it concludes that there exist $p(z)$ and $q(z)$ such that $p(z)f(z) + q(z)g(z)=1$. If this follows from the previous statement, I don't see how. Secondly, I don't understand how it concludes that $q(A)g(A)X=q(A)Xg(-B)$. Again, if it follows from a previous statement, it is not clear how. If anyone can explain these steps, or provide a different proof, it would be greatly appreciated.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The first implication is Bézout's identity for polynomials . It's an equivalent for the Euclidean domain of polynomials of the ordinary one about coprime integers $x$ and $y$ having integers $a$ and $b$ so that $ax+by=1$. The second one can be seen inductively. $g(A)$ is a sum of monomials $A^k$, so by linearity it suffices to prove that $A^kX=X(-B)^k$ for integer $k$ at least $1$ (the constant term is obvious, since $I$ commutes with $X$). This follows by induction: The basis case is $AX=-XB$, which we already have. If it is true for $k$ ( viz. $A^kX=X(-B)^k$), then \n$$A^{k+1}X = A(A^kX)=A(X(-B)^k) = (AX)(-B)^k = (-XB)(-B)^k = X(-B)^{k+1},$$ where the second equality uses the induction hypothesis and the third uses the basis case. Hence it is true for all integer $k\\geq 1$, and the implication follows.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this question and format it according to the user's guidelines. The user wants the problem structured into Assumptions and Problem sections, with each assumption addressing only one property or condition applied to one object. \n\nFirst, the original problem is about proving that the Sylvester equation AX + XB = C has a unique solution when A and -B share no eigenvalues. The user has a specific question about the proof provided on Wikipedia, focusing on two steps they don't understand. However, the task here is to extract the main problem and its assumptions, not to answer the user's specific confusions about the proof steps.\n\nLooking at the example given, the key is to list all assumptions line by line. The main problem here is to prove uniqueness and existence of the solution under certain conditions. The assumptions from the problem statement would be:\n\n1. A and B are complex matrices.\n2. A and -B share no eigenvalues.\n\nThese are the two main conditions. The problem then is to prove that under these assumptions, the Sylvester equation has a unique solution for any C. The user's specific questions about the proof steps are part of their confusion but aren't part of the structured problem. The structured problem should just capture the original question's main theorem to prove.\n\nSo, the Assumptions section should list that A and B are complex matrices, and that A and -B have no common eigenvalues. The Problem is to prove that the Sylvester equation AX + XB = C has a unique solution X for any given C.\n\nWait, but in the original problem statement, the user mentions \"complex matrices\" in the question. So that's an explicit assumption. The other condition is that A and -B share no eigenvalues. Each of these should be separate lines in the Assumptions section.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nA and B are complex matrices,\nA and -B share no eigenvalues.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the Sylvester equation AX + XB = C has a unique solution X for any complex matrix C.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is a single line addressing one property. The first assumption is that A and B are complex matrices. The second is that their eigenvalues (with the sign change for B) don't overlap. That's two separate assumptions. The problem statement then is about the unique solution existing.",
