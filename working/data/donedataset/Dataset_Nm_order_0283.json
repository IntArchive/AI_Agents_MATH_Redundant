    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to structure the problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The original problem is about proving an inequality involving three variables a, b, c with a condition on their squares. The example provided shows that assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. \n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions in the problem. The problem states that a, b, c are greater than or equal to 0, and that a² + b² + c² = 3. These are two separate conditions. The first one applies to each variable individually (non-negativity), and the second is a collective condition on their squares summing to 3. \n\nSo, breaking it down:\n1. Each variable a, b, c is non-negative. But since the problem states \"a, b, c ≥ 0\", I should list each variable separately? Wait, the example given in the user's instruction lists \"$n$ is an integer\" as one assumption and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\" as another, even though both apply to the same object. Here, a, b, c are all non-negative. However, the example lists each assumption line by line, even if they apply to the same object. Wait, in the example, the original problem was about n being an integer and then the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. Wait, but in the original problem, the user had written \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, it's listed as two separate assumptions. Wait, but in the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, no, the example's original problem was probably a different problem where the user made a mistake? Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem lists assumptions: \"n is an integer\", \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but that's inconsistent because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". Maybe that example was a mistake? Or perhaps there was a miscommunication. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect? Because if the original problem is for every integer n, but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, that changes the problem. So maybe the example is wrong. But regardless, the user is providing that example as a guideline.\n\nSo following the user's example, even if the original problem states \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem lists each assumption line by line. But in that example, the problem is to prove divisibility by 91, which is 7*13, so maybe the user intended that n must be such that it's divisible by 7 and 13, but that's not clear. However, perhaps the example is not correct, but the user wants me to follow the format where each assumption is listed line by line, even if they apply to the same object. So in the current problem, the user's original question states \"a, b, c ≥ 0\" and \"a² + b² + c² = 3\". These are two separate conditions. So the assumptions should be:\n\n- a, b, c are non-negative real numbers (each one is ≥0)\n- The sum of their squares is 3.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. Wait, in the example, \"n is an integer\" is one assumption, \"n is divisible by 7\" is another. So each condition on the same object is a separate line. So here, \"a, b, c ≥ 0\" can be split into three separate assumptions: a ≥0, b ≥0, c ≥0. But the problem states \"a, b, c ≥ 0\", which is a collective condition. However, according to the example, if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" as one assumption. So perhaps in this case, \"a, b, c ≥ 0\" is a single assumption? But the example splits \"n is an integer\" and another condition on n as separate. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, the example's original problem says \"for every integer n\", which is one condition. But the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added an extra condition. Maybe the example is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the user wanted to extract all the conditions from the problem, but in the example, the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7, but the formatted problem included it. That would be a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the user provided a different example. Wait, maybe the example is correct in the sense that the original problem required divisibility by 91, which factors into 7 and 13, so the assumptions would include that n is divisible by both. But the original problem states \"for every integer n\", which contradicts that. Therefore, maybe the example is incorrect. But regardless, the user's instruction is to list each assumption line by line, each addressing only one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo, going back to the current problem. The problem states: Let a, b, c ≥0 such that a² + b² + c² =3. Prove that (a³ +a +1)(b³ +b +1)(c³ +c +1) ≤27.\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n1. a is non-negative.\n2. b is non-negative.\n3. c is non-negative.\n4. a² + b² + c² =3.\n\nBut according to the example, if the original problem had \"for every integer n\", then the assumption is \"n is an integer\". Here, \"a, b, c ≥0\" could be considered three separate assumptions (each variable's non-negativity) or a single collective assumption. However, the example splits conditions on the same object. For instance, in the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are two separate assumptions even though they both apply to n. So similarly, here, each variable's non-negativity would be separate.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem states \"a, b, c ≥0\", maybe that's considered a single assumption about all three variables. But the example's structure seems to split conditions even for the same object, so perhaps we need to split each variable's non-negativity into separate assumptions. However, the user's example for the original problem's formatted version lists two assumptions on the same object (n). Therefore, in this case, to follow the example, each condition on the same object is a separate line.\n\nBut here, the variables are different (a, b, c), so each being non-negative would be three separate assumptions. Then the fourth assumption is the sum of squares equals 3.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions section would have:\n\na is non-negative,\nb is non-negative,\nc is non-negative,\na² + b² + c² = 3.\n\nBut let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem is about n being any integer, but the formatted problem includes \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So that seems like the formatted problem added an extra condition. Maybe the example is wrong, but since the user provided it, I should follow their format. However, in the current problem, there's no such extra condition. The original problem states \"Let a, b, c ≥0 such that a² + b² + c²=3\". So the assumptions are:\n\n1. a ≥0,\n2. b ≥0,\n3. c ≥0,\n4. a² + b² + c² =3.\n\nThus, four assumptions.\n\nSo the formatted problem would list each of these four assumptions line by line, then the problem statement.\n\nThe user's example in the original question has in the formatted problem:\n\nAssumption: $n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem: Prove that...\n\nSo each assumption is on a new line, even if they apply to the same object. Therefore, in the current problem, each variable's non-negativity is a separate line, then the sum of squares is another line.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption: a is non-negative,\nAssumption: b is non-negative,\nAssumption: c is non-negative,\nAssumption: a² + b² + c² = 3,\nProblem: Prove that $$(a^3 + a + 1)(b^3 + b + 1)(c^3 + c + 1) \\leq 27.$$\n\nYes, that seems correct. Let me verify again. The original problem says \"Let be a,b,c ≥0 such that: a² + b² + c²=3. Prove that...\". So the conditions are each variable non-negative and the sum of squares equals 3. Each variable's non-negativity is a separate assumption. So four assumptions in total.",
