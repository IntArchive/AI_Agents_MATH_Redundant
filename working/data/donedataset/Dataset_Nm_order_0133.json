    "AcceptedAnswer": "The proof is quite simple. Let's write our sum in a compact format: $$\n1+z+2z^2+3z^3+5z^4+8z^5+... = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty F_nz^n\n$$\nWhere $F_n$ is the $n$th Fibonacci number, starting with $F_0=F_1=1$, and $F_{n+2}=F_n+F_{n+1}$. It is from here that we will prove what needs to be proven. $$\\begin{align}\n(1-z-z^2)\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty F_nz^n &= \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty F_nz^n - \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty F_nz^{n+1} - \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty F_nz^{n+2}\\\\\n&= \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty F_nz^n - \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty F_{n-1}z^n-\\sum_{n=2}^\\infty F_{n-2}z^n\\\\\n&= F_0 + (F_1-F_0)z + \\sum_{n=2}^\\infty (F_n-F_{n-1}-F_{n-2})z^n\n\\end{align}$$\nNow, $F_1=F_0$ and $F_n=F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}$. Therefore, $$\n(1-z-z^2)\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty F_nz^n = F_0 = 1\n$$\nAnd thus $$\n\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty F_nz^n = \\frac{1}{1-(z+z^2)}\n$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that the Assumptions section lists each condition applied to one object per line. The Problem section should then state the problem clearly.\n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The title is \"The generating function for the Fibonacci numbers,\" and the question is to prove that the generating function \\(1 + z + 2z^2 + 3z^3 + 5z^4 + 8z^5 + 13z^6 + \\dots\\) equals \\(\\frac{1}{1 - (z + z^2)}\\). The coefficients are the Fibonacci sequence starting with 1, 1, 2, 3, etc.\n\nNow, looking at the assumptions part. The example given had assumptions about the variable (n being an integer, n divisible by 7). Here, the problem is about generating functions and Fibonacci numbers. What assumptions are inherent here?\n\nFirst, the generating function is a power series where the coefficients correspond to the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as starting with 1, 1, then each term is the sum of the two previous. But in the problem statement, the coefficients start with 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, etc. So maybe the assumption is about the definition of the Fibonacci numbers here. Let's check the exact sequence given: {1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,...}. That's the standard Fibonacci sequence starting with F₀=1, F₁=1, F₂=2, etc. Wait, sometimes Fibonacci numbers are indexed starting at F₀=0, F₁=1, but in this case, the sequence starts with 1,1,2,... so perhaps the assumption is that the Fibonacci numbers here are defined with F₀=1, F₁=1. That's an important assumption because different indexing can affect the generating function.\n\nAnother assumption is that the generating function is expressed as a power series in terms of z. So the variable here is z, and we are working in the context of formal power series or analytic functions, but the problem doesn't specify convergence, so maybe it's assumed to be formal.\n\nSo the key assumptions would be:\n\n1. The coefficients of the generating function are Fibonacci numbers.\n2. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as F₀ = 1, F₁ = 1, and Fₙ = Fₙ₋₁ + Fₙ₋₂ for n ≥ 2.\n3. The generating function is a formal power series in variable z.\n\nBut the problem statement already mentions that the coefficients are Fibonacci numbers, so maybe the main assumption is about how the Fibonacci sequence is defined here. The problem statement gives the sequence as {1,1,2,3,5,8,...}, so perhaps the first term is F₀=1, F₁=1, etc. That's an important starting point for constructing the generating function.\n\nWait, but in the example given in the user's example, the assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So in that case, assumptions are about the variables and any conditions applied. In this current problem, maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- The sequence of coefficients is the Fibonacci sequence defined by F₀=1, F₁=1, and Fₙ = Fₙ₋₁ + Fₙ₋₂ for n ≥ 2.\n- The generating function is represented as a power series in z.\n\nBut perhaps the problem doesn't have explicit assumptions beyond the coefficients being Fibonacci numbers as defined. Let me check the original problem again. The problem says: \"Prove that [the generating function] equals 1/(1 - (z + z²)). The coefficients are Fibonacci numbers, i.e., the sequence {1,1,2,3,5,8,...}.\" So the problem itself states that the coefficients are the Fibonacci numbers as per the given sequence. Therefore, the key assumption is the definition of the Fibonacci numbers here. So the assumption should list that the Fibonacci numbers are defined as starting with 1,1,2,3,... and each subsequent term is the sum of the two previous terms.\n\nSo each assumption line should address one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe coefficients of the generating function are Fibonacci numbers,\nThe Fibonacci sequence is defined as F₀ = 1, F₁ = 1,\nFor n ≥ 2, Fₙ = Fₙ₋₁ + Fₙ₋₂,\nThe generating function is a power series in variable z.\n\nBut maybe the problem doesn't require all these assumptions. Let me think. The problem is to show that the generating function with those coefficients equals 1/(1 - (z + z²)). The key assumptions are that the coefficients follow the Fibonacci recurrence and initial conditions. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe generating function has coefficients F₀, F₁, F₂, ... where F₀ = 1,\nF₁ = 1,\nFor each integer n ≥ 2, Fₙ = Fₙ₋₁ + Fₙ₋₂.\n\nEach of these is a separate line, each addressing one condition applied to one object. Then the problem is to prove that the generating function equals 1/(1 - (z + z²)).\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nThe generating function has coefficients $F_0, F_1, F_2, \\ldots$,\n$F_0 = 1$,\n$F_1 = 1$,\nFor each integer $n \\geq 2$, $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$.\nProblem: \nProve that $$1 + z + 2z^2 + 3z^3 + 5z^4 + 8z^5 + 13z^6 + \\cdots = \\frac{1}{1 - (z + z^2)}.$$",
