    "AcceptedAnswer": "Edited It turns out this integral is done in http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.0891 , which O.L. linked to in a comment to another question. This isn't much of an answer, really, as for all the closed forms I refer you to that paper. Write the integral (by change of variable) as\n$$ \\frac12 \\int_0^\\infty K(\\sqrt{-1-2\\cosh \\theta})\\,d\\theta, $$\nthen expand this into a double integral from the definition of $K$, and integrate over $\\theta$ to get\n$$ \\int_0^1 \\frac{dt}{\\sqrt{1-t^2}\\sqrt{1+3t^2}} K\\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{1-t^2}{1+3t^2}} \\right). $$\nAnother change of variable\n$$ t^2 = \\frac{1}{v^2+1} $$\nwill bring it to the form\n$$ \\frac1\\pi\\overline V_3(1,1,1) = \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{dv}{\\sqrt{(v^2+4)(v^2+1)}}K\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{v^2}{v^2+4}}\\right), $$\nwhich is equation (32) in that paper. It is evaluated by considering an integral of a product of three modified Bessel functions, and that integral was done in two papers by W. N. Bailey in 1934 (\"Some indefinite integrals involving Bessel functions\"). As a consequence, the integral equals\n$$ \\Re\\left( K(e^{-\\pi i/6})^2\\right). $$\nIn that paper, (equation 39) they also give the equivalent form (I don't know a proof why this is equivalent to the above)\n$$ \\frac12 K(\\sin(\\pi/12))K(\\cos(\\pi/12)) = \\frac{\\sqrt3}2 K(\\sin(\\pi/12))^2, $$\nand the closed form exists because $\\sin\\frac\\pi{12}$ is a singular value (see mathworld ) of the elliptic integral:\n$$ \\frac{3\\Gamma(\\frac13)^6}{32\\pi^2 2^{2/3}}. $$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions and then state the problem clearly.\n\nThe original question is about finding a closed form for a double integral. The user provided an integral expression and some equivalent forms involving the complete elliptic integral K(x). They also mention numerical integration suggesting a conjectural closed form involving the Gamma function and ask for a proof. There's also a mention of a Meijer G-function result from Mathematica but no manual proof.\n\nSo, the assumptions here would be the definitions given. The integral is defined as I = integral from 1 to infinity of integral from 0 to 1 of [1/(sqrt(x²-1) sqrt(1-y²) sqrt(1-y²+4x²y²))] dy dx. Then, it's represented using the elliptic integral K. The problem is to prove that this integral equals 3 Γ(1/3)^6 / (2^(17/3) π²).\n\nI need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let's see:\n\n1. The integral I is defined as the double integral over x from 1 to ∞ and y from 0 to 1 with the given integrand.\n2. The integral I can be expressed as an integral involving the complete elliptic integral of the first kind K(√(1-4x²)) divided by √(x²-1) dx from 1 to ∞.\n3. Alternatively, I is the real part of an integral involving K(√((1+3y²)/(1-y²))) divided by (1-y²) dy from 0 to 1.\n4. K(x) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind.\n5. Numerical integration suggests the conjectured closed form involving Γ(1/3)^6, 2^(17/3), and π².\n6. A Meijer G-function expression was obtained via Mathematica but no manual proof is available.\n\nBut the problem is to prove the conjecture that I equals 3 Γ(1/3)^6 / (2^(17/3) π²).\n\nWait, the example given in the user's instruction for the original problem had assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, the assumptions are more about the definitions and representations of the integral. Each assumption should be a single condition applied to one object. So breaking down:\n\n- First, the definition of I as the double integral.\n- Then, the representation using K in terms of x.\n- Then, the alternative representation using K in terms of y.\n- K is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind.\n- The conjecture based on numerical integration.\n- The Meijer G-function result from Mathematica.\n\nBut maybe some of these are not necessary for the problem's assumptions. The key assumptions are the definitions of I and the forms it can take. The conjectured closed form is the target. The Meijer G-function part is part of the user's attempt but not an assumption of the problem. Similarly, the numerical integration leading to the conjecture is part of the problem's context.\n\nSo the assumptions should include:\n\n1. I is defined as the double integral given.\n2. I can be expressed as an integral involving K(√(1-4x²))/√(x²-1) from 1 to ∞.\n3. I can also be written as the real part of another integral involving K with a different argument.\n4. K(x) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind.\n\nThe problem is to prove that I equals the conjectured Gamma expression.\n\nBut the example's assumptions were more about the conditions on the variables (like n being integer and divisible by 7). Here, the integral definitions are part of the problem setup. So perhaps each integral representation is an assumption. The problem is to prove the conjectured closed form.\n\nSo structuring it:\n\nAssumption:\nI is defined as ∫₁^∞ ∫₀¹ [1/(sqrt(x²-1) sqrt(1-y²) sqrt(1-y²+4x²y²))] dy dx,\nI equals ∫₁^∞ K(√(1-4x²))/sqrt(x²-1) dx,\nI equals Re ∫₀¹ K(√((1+3y²)/(1-y²)))/(1-y²) dy,\nK(x) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind,\nNumerical integration suggests I equals 3 Γ(1/3)^6 / (2^{17/3} π²).\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were the conditions on n. Here, the assumptions are the definitions and equivalent forms. However, the user's example included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the problem's condition. In the current problem, there's no such condition on variables; instead, the problem is to show the equality given the integral definitions. So the assumptions are the definitions and representations of I, and the conjecture.\n\nWait, but the problem is to prove the conjecture. So the conjecture is not an assumption but the problem statement. The assumptions are the definitions of I and the forms it takes. So the problem is to prove that I equals the given Gamma expression.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should list the integral definitions and the representations using K. The problem is to prove the conjectured closed form.\n\nBut the example's assumptions included two points: n is integer, n is divisible by 7. Each line was a single condition on one object.\n\nHere, each assumption would be a separate line for each integral representation. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem's formatted version:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nIn this case, the current problem's assumptions would be the definitions of I and its equivalent forms, and the properties of K(x). So each integral expression is an assumption.\n\nBut the user's instructions say \"filtered the unrelated information\". The question mentions that the integral can be represented in two forms involving K(x), and that numerical integration suggests a conjecture. The Meijer G-function result is part of their attempt but not part of the problem's assumptions. So the assumptions are:\n\n- I is defined as the original double integral.\n- I can be expressed as ∫₁^∞ K(...)/sqrt(x²-1) dx.\n- I can be expressed as Re ∫₀¹ K(...)/(1-y²) dy.\n- K(x) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind.\n- Numerical integration suggests I equals the conjectured Gamma expression.\n\nBut the problem is to prove the conjecture. However, in the example, the assumption included the conditions on n (integer, divisible by 7), and the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. Here, the problem is to prove the equality to the Gamma expression. So the assumptions are the definitions and the representations. But the numerical integration leading to the conjecture is not an assumption but motivation. Similarly, the Meijer G-function is part of their attempt but not an assumption.\n\nSo perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n1. I is defined as the double integral ∫₁^∞ ∫₀¹ [1/(sqrt(x²-1) sqrt(1-y²) sqrt(1-y²+4x²y²))] dy dx.\n2. I can be represented as ∫₁^∞ K(√(1-4x²))/sqrt(x²-1) dx.\n3. I can also be represented as Re ∫₀¹ K(√((1+3y²)/(1-y²)))/(1-y²) dy.\n4. K(x) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind.\n\nThe problem is to prove that I equals 3 Γ(1/3)^6/(2^{17/3} π²).\n\nThe numerical integration suggestion is part of the problem's context but not an assumption. The Meijer G-function result is their attempt but not part of the problem's setup.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nI = ∫₁^∞ ∫₀¹ [1/(sqrt(x²-1) sqrt(1-y²) sqrt(1-y²+4x²y²))] dy dx,\nI = ∫₁^∞ [K(√(1-4x²))]/sqrt(x²-1) dx,\nI = Re ∫₀¹ [K(√((1+3y²)/(1-y²)))]/(1-y²) dy,\nK(x) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind.\n\nProblem: Prove that I = 3 Γ(1/3)^6/(2^{17/3} π²).\n\nEach assumption is a separate line, each addressing one property.
