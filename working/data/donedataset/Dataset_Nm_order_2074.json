    "Content": "I apologize beforehand if this is an extremely easy question, I have very limited experience with proving convexity statements. Also, the reason that I choose such a simple example before tackling harder ones is that, if I cannot prove this one, then I have no hope it proving harder convexity statements. My goal was to shows that the simple $f(x) = x^2$ was convex using the definition only (taking the second derivative and showing is positive is NOT the approach I am looking for). Recall the definition of a convex function: $f$ is called convex if:\n$$\\forall x_1, x_2 \\in X, \\forall t \\in [0, 1]: \\qquad f(tx_1+(1-t)x_2)\\leq t f(x_1)+(1-t)f(x_2).$$ Therefore, I decided to apply both sides of the definition and then compare them: $$(t x_1 + (1-t) x_2)^2 = t^2x_1^2+2x_1x_2t(1-t)+(1-t)^2x_2^2$$ and I wanted to compare it to: $$t x_1^2+(1-t)x_2^2$$ I was a little stuck because I didn't know how to show that the inequality is actually true. Intuitively it makes sense because $t \\leq 1$ and its square is smaller and thus $t^2x_1^2 \\leq t x_1^2$, similarly, $t^2x_2^2 \\leq t x_2^2$. However, it was unclear what the cross term did. How do I know that it does not overshoot and make the inequality false? Thanks for everyones patience.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Subtracting the LHS from the RHS gives $$(t-t^2)x_1^2-2x_1x_2t(1-t)+(t-t^2)x_2^2=t(1-t)(x_1^2-2x_1x_2+x_2^2)=t(1-t)(x_1-x_2)^2\\ge 0$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that f(x) = x² is convex using only the definition of convexity. The definition given is that for any x₁, x₂ in the domain and t in [0,1], f(tx₁ + (1-t)x₂) ≤ t f(x₁) + (1-t)f(x₂). \n\nFirst, I need to recall the steps involved in proving convexity via the definition. The user already expanded the left side of the inequality: (t x₁ + (1-t)x₂)², which results in t²x₁² + 2x₁x₂t(1-t) + (1-t)²x₂². The right side of the inequality is t x₁² + (1-t)x₂². \n\nThe goal is to show that the left side is less than or equal to the right side. To do this, subtract the left side from the right side and show that the result is non-negative. Let's compute that difference:\n\nt x₁² + (1-t)x₂² - [t²x₁² + 2x₁x₂t(1-t) + (1-t)²x₂²]\n\nSimplifying this expression:\n\n= t x₁² + (1-t)x₂² - t²x₁² - 2x₁x₂t(1-t) - (1-t)²x₂²\n\nFactor terms with x₁² and x₂²:\n\n= t(1 - t)x₁² + (1-t)(1 - (1 - t))x₂² - 2x₁x₂t(1-t)\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let's factor out t(1-t) from the terms. Let me see:\n\nt x₁² - t²x₁² = t(1 - t)x₁²\n\nSimilarly, (1-t)x₂² - (1-t)²x₂² = (1-t)(1 - (1 - t))x₂² = (1-t)t x₂²\n\nSo combining those terms:\n\nt(1 - t)x₁² + t(1 - t)x₂² - 2x₁x₂t(1-t)\n\nFactor out t(1-t):\n\n= t(1 - t)[x₁² + x₂² - 2x₁x₂]\n\nNotice that x₁² + x₂² - 2x₁x₂ is (x₁ - x₂)². So:\n\n= t(1 - t)(x₁ - x₂)²\n\nSince t is in [0,1], t(1 - t) is non-negative because both t and (1-t) are between 0 and 1, so their product is non-negative. Also, (x₁ - x₂)² is always non-negative. Therefore, the entire expression t(1 - t)(x₁ - x₂)² is non-negative. This means that the difference between the right side and the left side is non-negative, hence proving that f(tx₁ + (1-t)x₂) ≤ t f(x₁) + (1-t)f(x₂). Therefore, f(x) = x² is convex.\n\nNow, structuring this into the required format. The assumptions here are:\n\n- f is defined as f(x) = x². This is a property of the function.\n- The domain X is such that x₁ and x₂ are elements of X. But since the problem doesn't specify any restrictions on X, and given that f(x) = x² is usually considered over real numbers, we might assume X is the set of real numbers. However, the original problem doesn't specify, so maybe we should leave it as \"X is the domain of f\".\n- The variable t is in the interval [0,1].\n\nBut according to the example provided, each assumption should address only one property applied to one object. So breaking down:\n\nAssumptions:\n- f(x) is defined as x squared.\n- x₁ and x₂ are elements of the domain X of f.\n- t is a real number in the interval [0, 1].\n\nProblem: Prove that f is convex using the definition of convexity.",
