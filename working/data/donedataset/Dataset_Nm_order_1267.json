    "Content": "I'm doing an independent study (self-taught course) in abstract algebra and I'm using the abstract algebra textbook here: http://abstract.ups.edu/ . In Chapter 9: Isomorphisms, problem 20 asks: \"Prove or disprove: Every abelian group of order divisible by $3$ contains a subgroup of order $3$.\" I spent a lot of time on this question and eventually came up with the answer below, but this question seemed a lot harder than all of the other questions. Keeping in mind that the book hasn't yet given me all of the usual tools to prove this (see below or the textbook for the ones I do have), did I miss something obvious? Or is this actually that hard? At one point, the book says, \"In Chapter 13, we will prove that all finite abelian groups are isomorphic to direct products of the form $\\mathbb{Z}_{p_1^{e_1}}\\times\\cdots\\times\\mathbb{Z}_{p_k^{e_k}}$, where $p_1,\\dots,p_k$ are (not necessarily distinct) primes.\" Do you think I was supposed to use this, even though the book hasn't proven it yet? So far, I've covered some basic material about cyclic groups, the groups $S_n$, $A_n$, and $D_n$, Lagrange's Theorem, basic properties of isomorphisms, and some basic direct product stuff. In particular, I have not covered quotients or group actions. For more complete information, please see the textbook. My solution (abbreviated) Call a group $3$-free if its order is not divisible by 3. Let $G$ be a group with order divisible by $3$, and find a maximal $3$-free subgroup $H$ (one that is not contained in any other $3$-free subgroup). Pick a $g\\in G\\setminus H$ and let $d$ be the least positive integer such that $g^d\\in H$. Then $g^iH=g^jH$ iff $i\\equiv j\\text{ mod }d$, so the subgroup (of $G$) $H'=\\langle g\\rangle H$ has $|H'|=d\\cdot |H|$. $|H'|$ must be divisible by $3$, so $d$ is divisible by $3$, and therefore the order $k$ of $g$ is divisible by $3$, so $g^{k/3}$ has order $3$. Thanks!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I assume that Sylow theorems were not covered yet? And since the theorem holds also for non-abelian groups, I wonder why they restrict to abelian groups. It makes the following easier though: Let $G$ be a group of order $n$ divisible by $3$. Select $h\\in G\\setminus\\{1\\}$. If the order of $h$ is divisible by $3$, then you find a power of $h$ that has order $3$. Otherwise $G/\\langle h\\rangle$ has order divisible by $3$ and can be assumed by induction to have an element $g+\\langle h\\rangle$ of order $3$, which has order a multiple of $3$ in $G$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to format this Math Stack Exchange question according to the user's guidelines. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor, read the problem, filter out unrelated info, and structure it into the specified format with assumptions and the problem statement. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question. The user is asking about an abstract algebra problem from a textbook. The problem is: \"Prove or disprove: Every abelian group of order divisible by 3 contains a subgroup of order 3.\" The user then goes into their experience with the problem, mentioning they found it hard, and discusses possible tools they might have or not have, like the structure theorem for finite abelian groups, which hasn't been covered yet. They also list the topics they have covered: cyclic groups, symmetric groups, alternating groups, dihedral groups, Lagrange's Theorem, isomorphisms, and direct products. They mention they haven't covered quotients or group actions. Their solution involves 3-free subgroups and constructing an element of order 3.\n\nBut according to the example given, the assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. The original problem's assumptions here would be:\n\n1. The group in question is abelian.\n2. The order of the group is divisible by 3.\n\nThese are the two main assumptions given in the problem statement. The rest of the text is about the user's experience, their solution approach, and their uncertainty about the difficulty level. So those parts are irrelevant for structuring the problem as per the format.\n\nSo, following the example, the assumptions are two points: abelian group and order divisible by 3. The problem is to prove or disprove that such a group has a subgroup of order 3.\n\nI need to check if there's any other implicit assumption. The user mentions the group is finite since the order is divisible by 3, so we can assume it's a finite abelian group. But the problem statement itself just says \"abelian group of order divisible by 3\". Since in group theory, when talking about order divisible by a number, it's usually finite unless otherwise specified. However, the problem might need to specify finiteness. Wait, the original problem says \"order divisible by 3\", so that implies finite order. So the problem is about finite abelian groups. So the assumptions are:\n\n- G is an abelian group.\n- The order of G is divisible by 3.\n\nHence, the formatted problem should have these two assumptions, each on a separate line. The problem is to prove or disprove the existence of a subgroup of order 3.\n\nThe user's own solution approach uses a maximal 3-free subgroup, which might be part of their thought process but isn't part of the problem's assumptions. The problem itself is straightforward as stated in the textbook question. The rest of the user's narrative is their personal experience and doesn't affect the problem's structure.\n\nSo, the final formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nG is an abelian group,\nThe order of G is divisible by 3.\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that G contains a subgroup of order 3.",
