    "Content": "The following formula was stated by Ramanujan: $$\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\coth n\\pi}{n^7}=\\frac{19\\pi^7}{56700}$$ Does anybody know the method of proof of this formula? I know that typically Ramanujan used extensively methods of divergent series, but I cannot see how to attempt a proof of this result. It looks somehow like a relatively simple result, but I can't see what methods might be used to obtain it.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe original question is about proving Ramanujan's formula for the infinite series involving the hyperbolic cotangent function. The series is the sum from n=1 to infinity of (coth(nπ))/n^7 equals 19π^7/56700. The user is asking about the method of proof for this formula.\n\nNow, looking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. However, in this problem, the original question doesn't explicitly state many assumptions. The main components here are the series itself, the terms involved (coth(nπ)/n^7), and the equality to 19π^7/56700. \n\nWait, but maybe there's an implicit assumption here. For instance, the convergence of the series? Or that n is a positive integer? The series starts from n=1, so n is a positive integer. Also, coth(nπ) is defined for nπ ≠ 0, which is satisfied since n ≥ 1. So the assumptions would be that n is a positive integer, and perhaps that the series converges (though the problem states the sum equals that value, so convergence is implied). However, in the example given, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7, even though the original problem statement mentioned \"for every integer n\". So maybe in this case, we need to list the implicit assumptions.\n\nSo, breaking it down:\n\nAssumption 1: n is a positive integer (since the sum starts at n=1 and goes to infinity).\n\nAssumption 2: The series ∑_{n=1}^∞ (coth(nπ))/n^7 converges. Although the problem states the sum equals a specific value, so maybe convergence is part of what needs to be proven, but perhaps the user assumes it converges. However, in the example, they didn't list convergence as an assumption, but rather specific conditions on n. Here, since the problem is about evaluating the sum, maybe the main assumption is that the series is summable and the result is as stated. But perhaps the problem is to prove the equality, so the assumptions would be the conditions under which this equality holds. Wait, Ramanujan's formulas often hold under certain conditions, but in this case, the question is about the method of proof. Maybe the original problem doesn't state any specific assumptions beyond the series definition. \n\nWait, the example given included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem, it was for every integer n. That example seems to have a mistake. Wait, no, looking back, the original problem in the example was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, they included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which contradicts. That seems like an error in the example. Wait, perhaps the example was incorrect. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted assumption lists n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that's conflicting because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Maybe the user made an error in the example. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions should only include what's in the problem, but maybe the example is flawed. So perhaps in this current problem, I should list the assumptions that are explicitly or implicitly stated.\n\nIn the given problem, the series starts at n=1, so n is a positive integer. The formula is claimed to hold, so the assumption is that the series converges to that value. But perhaps the problem is to prove the equality, so the assumptions would be the conditions necessary for the equality to hold, which might include properties of the hyperbolic cotangent function, or modular forms, or some other mathematical framework. However, the user's example seems to list explicit conditions on the variables, not on the mathematical methods.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is asking for the method of proof, maybe the assumptions are about the mathematical objects involved. For example, using properties of the hyperbolic cotangent, or the series' relation to certain zeta functions or modular forms. But according to the example format, assumptions are about the problem's conditions, not the methods. So perhaps in this case, the only assumption is that n is a positive integer, as the sum is from n=1 to infinity. But in the example, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So following that, here the assumption would be n is a positive integer. But in the example, they added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7, which might be incorrect. Maybe the example was a bad example. Let's proceed carefully.\n\nGiven the problem: Prove that the sum from n=1 to infinity of (coth(nπ))/n^7 equals 19π^7/56700. The assumptions here are that the series is taken over positive integers n, and that coth(nπ) is defined (which it is for n ≥ 1). So the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n- The series ∑_{n=1}^∞ (coth(nπ))/n^7 converges.\n\nBut in the example, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", which seems incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the user's example has a mistake, and the correct approach is to list the assumptions that are actually given in the problem. In the current problem, the question is about the method to prove the given equality. The problem itself is to show the sum equals that value, so the assumptions would be the conditions under which this equality holds, which might be that n runs over positive integers, and the series converges. However, since the problem is stated as a fact (Ramanujan stated it), perhaps the main assumption is that the series is as defined, and the problem is to prove the equality. Therefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\n- n is a positive integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that ∑_{n=1}^∞ (coth(nπ))/n^7 = 19π^7/56700.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are more assumptions. For example, perhaps properties of coth(nπ) related to elliptic functions or modular forms, but those would be part of the method, not assumptions. The user wants to filter unrelated information and structure the problem with its assumptions. The original question doesn't specify any particular conditions beyond the series definition, so the main assumption is that n is a positive integer. Therefore, the formatted problem should list that n is a positive integer, and the problem is to prove the sum equals that value.",
