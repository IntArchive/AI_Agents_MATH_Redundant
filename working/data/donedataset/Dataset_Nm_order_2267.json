    "Content": "Let $(M,g)$ be a Riemannian manifold. Then I want to show that these are equivalent: (i) Each point of $M$ has a smooth coordinate neighborhood in which the coordinate frame is orthonormal. (ii) $g$ is flat. Here's what I've tried: (i) $\\Rightarrow$ (ii): Let $p$ be a point in $M$ . Assume it has a smooth coordinate neighborhood in which the coordinate frame is orthonormal, i.e., a local frame $(E_1,...,E_n)$ on an open set $U$ around $p$ such that $\\langle E_i,E_j\\rangle_g=\\delta_{ij}$ . Since $M$ is a smooth manifold, $U$ is diffeomorphic to an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ by the diffeomorphism $F$ . So, it suffices to  show that $F^\\ast g= \\tilde{g}$ , where $\\tilde{g}$ is Euclidean metric. By the definition of Riemannian metric, this is true. (Is this true really?) (ii) $\\Rightarrow$ (i): Assume $g$ is flat, i.e., every point $p$ in $M$ has a neighborhood $U$ such that $(U,g|_U)$ is isometric to an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with the Euclidean metric. So $U$ is diffeomorphic to an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ and $F^\\ast g= \\tilde{g}$ , where $\\tilde{g}$ is Euclidean metric. Since ( $\\partial/\\partial x^i$ ) is an orthonormal frame in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ , it gives an orthonormal frame in $U$ . (I don't know how.) Thanks in advance.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The key word in the question is the coordinate neighborhood, so a clear definition of it would help. Definition 1. A coordinate neighborhood of a point $p \\in M$ is an open subset $U \\subset M$ endowed with a collection of functions $x^i \\colon U \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, where $i=1,\\dots,n$, such that the map\n$$\n\\textbf{x} \\colon U \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^n \\colon p \\mapsto\n\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\nx^{1}\\\\\n\\vdots\\\\\nx^{n}\n\\end{array}\\right)\n$$\nis a diffeomorphism onto its image. Briefly it is denoted by $(U,x^i)$. The functions $x^i$ are called the coordinate functions. The corresponding coordinate vector fields $\\partial_i := \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial{x^i}}$ are defined as the partial derivatives w.r.t. to coordinate $x^i$, so that $\\partial_i x^j = \\delta_i^j$. No Riemannian structure is involved so far. There is so called the standard frame $(E_i \\in \\Gamma(T \\mathbb{R}^n))$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $E_i = (0,\\dots,1,\\dots,0)$ with $1$ in the $i$-th position. The Euclidean metric $g^E \\in \\Gamma(S^2 T \\mathbb{R}^n)$ is defined by\n$$\ng^E(E_i,E_j)=\\delta_{ij}\n$$ The coordinate frame $(\\partial_i)$ is the pullback of the standard frame $(E_i)$ by map $\\textbf{x}$, that is\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial{x^i}} = \\textbf{x}^*E_i\n$$ Now, let $U$ be an open subset of a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$. A smooth map \n$$\nF \\colon (U,g|_U) \\rightarrow (\\mathbb{R}^n, g^E)\n$$\nis an isometry onto its image if $F_*g=g^E$ or, equivalently, $g = F^*g^E$. Recall, that for a diffeomorphism $F$ the pull-back is the inverse of the pushforward: $F^* = (F_*)^{-1}$. As one can see from the question, the OP uses the following Definition 2. A Riemannian metric $g$ on a smooth manifold $M$ is called locally flat if for any point $p \\in M$ there is an open neighborhood $U$ of $p$ such that $U, g|_U$ is isometric to an open subset of $(\\mathbb{R}^n, g^E)$. For brevity, the term \"flat metric\" is often used instead. Let me restate slightly the fact in the question as the following Proposition. For an open subset $U$ of a Riemannian manifold $(M.g)$ the following conditions are equivalent. (i) $U$ is a \"coordinate neighborhood\" (of any of its points) in which the coordinate frame is orthonormal; (ii) $(U,g|_U)$ is isometric to an open subset of $(R^n, g^E)$. Proof. $(i) \\Rightarrow (ii)$ Check that map $\\textbf{x} \\colon U \\rightarrow (R^n, g^E)$ provides the necessary isometry, i.e. $g = \\textbf{x}^* g^E$. Indeed,\n$$\ng_{ij}=g(\\partial_i,\\partial_j)=\\textbf{x}^* g^E(\\partial_i,\\partial_j) = g^E(\\textbf{x}_* \\partial_i, \\textbf{x}_* \\partial_j) = g^E (E_i, E_j) = \\delta_{ij}\n$$\nwhich exactly means that the coordinate frame $(\\partial_i)$ is orthonormal. $(ii) \\Rightarrow (i)$ Let $F: (U,g|_U) \\rightarrow (\\mathbb{R}^n,g^E)$ be an isometry. Define\n$$\nx^i (p) := F^i (p)\n$$\ni.e. $\\mathbf{x} = F$. Now $(U,x^i)$ is a \"coordinate neighborhood\". QED. As one can see, this is in fact a tautology: everything is hidden in the definitions!",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original question is about proving the equivalence between two statements regarding a Riemannian manifold: each point having a smooth coordinate neighborhood with an orthonormal coordinate frame, and the metric being flat.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem is about a Riemannian manifold (M, g). The two conditions to be proven equivalent are (i) each point has a coordinate neighborhood where the coordinate frame is orthonormal, and (ii) g is flat. \n\nLooking at the example provided, assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. Here, the main objects are M and g. The assumptions would be that (M, g) is a Riemannian manifold. Then, each of the two conditions (i) and (ii) might be considered as separate points, but since the problem is to show their equivalence, the assumptions might just be that (M, g) is a Riemannian manifold, and the problem is to prove the equivalence. Wait, in the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, the problem is to show equivalence under the general assumption of a Riemannian manifold. So the main assumption is that (M, g) is a Riemannian manifold, and no additional conditions. The problem is to show (i) iff (ii).\n\nBut the user's example had assumptions listed as properties of the objects involved. So maybe the assumption here is just that (M, g) is a Riemannian manifold. Then the problem is to prove the equivalence. So in the formatted problem, the assumption is (M, g) is a Riemannian manifold, and the problem is to show (i) and (ii) are equivalent.\n\nI need to check if there are more assumptions. The original problem states \"Let (M,g) be a Riemannian manifold.\" So that's the primary assumption. The user's example included multiple assumptions if necessary. Here, there's only one object, (M, g), and the assumption is that it's a Riemannian manifold. So the assumption line would be: (M, g) is a Riemannian manifold.\n\nThe problem is to prove that (i) each point has a smooth coordinate neighborhood with orthonormal coordinate frame if and only if (ii) g is flat.\n\nBut wait, in the original question, the user is trying to work through the proof and has some doubts. But the task is to structure the problem, not the attempt. So filtering out the user's attempt and just focusing on the problem statement.\n\nOriginal problem as given in the question:\n\nTitle: Each point of M has a smooth coordinate neighborhood in which the coordinate frame is orthonormal iff g is flat\n\nQuestion: Let (M,g) be a Riemannian manifold. Then I want to show that these are equivalent: (i) Each point of M has a smooth coordinate neighborhood in which the coordinate frame is orthonormal. (ii) g is flat.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have assumption: (M, g) is a Riemannian manifold. Then the problem is to show the equivalence between (i) and (ii).\n\nBut in the example, the assumption was broken into separate lines. However, here, the only assumption is that (M, g) is a Riemannian manifold. So perhaps the assumption is:\n\nAssumption:\n(M, g) is a Riemannian manifold.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the following are equivalent:\n(i) Each point of M has a smooth coordinate neighborhood in which the coordinate frame is orthonormal.\n(ii) g is flat.\n\nBut the original problem statement includes both (i) and (ii) as the two conditions to be proven equivalent. So the problem is to show the equivalence of (i) and (ii). Therefore, the formatted problem should list the assumption that (M, g) is a Riemannian manifold, and the problem is to prove the equivalence.\n\nAnother check: In the example, the user had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Each on separate lines. Here, the only initial assumption is that (M, g) is a Riemannian manifold. There are no other conditions given. So the assumption part is straightforward.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n(M, g) is a Riemannian manifold.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the following are equivalent:\n(i) Each point of M has a smooth coordinate neighborhood in which the coordinate frame is orthonormal.\n(ii) g is flat.\n\nBut perhaps I need to make sure each part of the problem is correctly captured. The user's original problem uses \"these are equivalent\" referring to (i) and (ii). So the problem statement is to prove the equivalence of (i) and (ii), given that (M, g) is a Riemannian manifold. Therefore, the formatted problem is as above.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me double-check. The user's example had assumptions broken into individual properties, each applied to one object. Here, the single assumption is that (M, g) is a Riemannian manifold. Therefore, the formatted problem should have that assumption, and the problem is to prove the equivalence.",
