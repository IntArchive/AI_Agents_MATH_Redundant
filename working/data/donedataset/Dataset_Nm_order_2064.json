    "AcceptedAnswer": "The proof that I gave in that thread works just as well here. It depends only on the fact that in any contiguous sequence of integers (here denominators) the maximal power $\\rm 2^k$ that divides any element occurs in precisely one element. Indeed, after the first (necessarily odd) multiple of $\\rm 2^k$, the next multiple would, by contiguity, be an even multiple, so a multiple of $\\rm 2^{k+1}$, contra maximality. Here is said proof: HINT $\\;$ Since there is a unique denominator $\\rm 2^k$ having maximal power of $2$, upon multiplying all terms through by $\\rm 2^{k-1}$ one deduces the contradiction that $\\rm\\; a/2 = b/c \\;$ with $\\rm \\; a,\\ c \\:$ odd. As an example: $\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad m = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} +\\; \\frac{1}{4} \\;+\\; \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{7} $ $\\quad\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad\\;\\; 2m = \\; 1 + \\frac{2}{3} +\\; \\frac{1}{2} \\;+\\; \\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{7} $ $\\quad\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad -\\frac{1}{2}  = \\; 1 + \\frac{2}{3} - 2m  + \\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{7}$ The prior sum has all odd denominators so reduces to a fraction with odd denominator $\\rm d\\:|3\\cdot 5\\cdot 7$. Note $\\:$ I purposely avoided any use of valuation theory because Anton requested an \"elementary\" solution. The above proof can easily be made comprehensible to a high-school student. The proof is trivial to anyone who knows valuation theory: namely the sum has a lone dominant term with 2-adic value $\\rm v_2<0\\:$ so, by the domination principle , the sum has 2-adic value $\\rm v_2<0\\:,\\:$ i.e. the sum has even denominator in lowest terms, so it is nonintegral.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The problem is to prove that the sum 1/(k+1) + 1/(k+2) + ... + 1/(k+n) is not an integer, given that k and n are positive integers. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the original question and any assumptions. The user mentioned that the case when k=0 is already proven in another question, which shows that the harmonic series up to n is never an integer. But here, k is a positive integer, so we're starting the sum from 1/(k+1) up to 1/(k+n). \n\nLet me recall the original problem's assumptions. The problem states that k and n are positive integers. So, both k and n are in Z^+, meaning they are at least 1. The sum is from k+1 to k+n. For example, if k=1 and n=2, the sum would be 1/2 + 1/3. Let me check if that's an integer: 1/2 + 1/3 = 5/6, which is not an integer. Similarly, other small examples: k=1, n=1: 1/2, not integer. k=2, n=3: 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 = 47/60, not integer. Hmm, seems like the sum isn't an integer. \n\nBut how to prove this in general? The case when k=0 is the harmonic series sum from 1 to n, which is known not to be an integer. The approach there might use Bertrand's postulate or properties of the denominators. Maybe a similar approach can be used here. Let's think.\n\nWhen k is a positive integer, the denominators in the sum are from k+1 to k+n. Let's denote the sum as S = ∑_{i=1}^n 1/(k+i). We need to show that S is not an integer.\n\nFirst, consider the denominators. Let's find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators. Let’s call that L. If we can show that when we express each fraction with denominator L, the numerator is not divisible by L, then the sum can't be an integer. But this might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe there's a prime number that divides exactly one of the denominators, so that when adding the fractions, the numerator is not divisible by that prime, hence the sum isn't an integer.\n\nThis approach is similar to the harmonic series proof. For the harmonic series, Bertrand's postulate is used to find a prime p between n/2 and n. Then, in the denominators 1 to n, p appears only once, and so when you take the LCM, there's a factor of p in the denominator that isn't canceled out in the numerator, leading to the sum not being an integer.\n\nPerhaps here, we can find a similar prime. Let's suppose there exists a prime p such that p divides one of the denominators k+i, but doesn't divide any other denominator. Then, in the LCM L, p would have the highest power in the denominator, and when we sum all the fractions, the numerator would have a term not divisible by p, while the rest would be divisible by p. Hence, the total numerator wouldn't be divisible by p, making the sum not an integer.\n\nBut how do we ensure such a prime exists? Let's try to adjust Bertrand's postulate here. Bertrand's says that for any integer m ≥ 2, there's a prime p with m < p < 2m. Maybe in our case, we can find a prime in the interval (k+1, k+n). Wait, but the denominators are from k+1 to k+n. So the denominators are in the range of n consecutive numbers. To apply Bertrand's, perhaps we need that among these numbers, there's a prime that is greater than n/2 or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the interval from k+1 to k+n contains a prime number that doesn't divide any other term in the interval. Let's think. Suppose that there's a prime p in the interval (k+1, k+n). Then, p divides exactly one denominator. If p > n, then p can't divide any other term in the interval, because the next multiple of p would be p + p = 2p, but since p > n, 2p > p + n (since p ≤ k + n, but I need to check). Wait, if p is in the interval [k+1, k+n], then the next multiple would be p + p, but if p > n, then p + p is at least 2(k+1). But since the interval is from k+1 to k+n, the next multiple would be outside the interval only if 2p > k +n. But since p ≤ k +n, 2p could be greater than k +n if p > (k +n)/2.\n\nSo if there is a prime p in ( (k+n)/2, k+n ], then 2p > k +n, so p can only appear once in the denominators. Therefore, if we can show that there's a prime p in ( (k+n)/2, k+n ], then p divides exactly one denominator. Then, when we take the LCM of the denominators, the highest power of p in L is p^1. When we write each fraction with denominator L, the numerator for the term with denominator p will be L/p, and the other terms will have numerators divisible by p. So the total numerator would be congruent to L/p mod p, which is not zero. Therefore, the sum can't be an integer.\n\nTherefore, the existence of such a prime p is key. But how do we ensure that such a prime exists? By Bertrand's postulate, for any integer m ≥ 2, there's a prime p with m < p < 2m. Let's set m = floor( (k +n)/2 ). If m ≥ 2, then there exists a prime p such that m < p < 2m. If 2m ≥ k +1, then p < 2m ≤ k +n (since m = floor( (k+n)/2 )). So we need to check if 2m ≥ k +1. Let's see.\n\nIf m = floor( (k +n)/2 ), then 2m is either k +n or k +n -1, depending on whether k +n is even or odd. Hence, 2m ≤ k +n. So if m ≥ 2, then Bertrand's postulate says there's a prime p between m and 2m, which is within ( (k +n)/2 -1, k +n ). But we need to check if this interval overlaps with the denominators from k+1 to k+n.\n\nWait, maybe this approach is getting too convoluted. Let's think differently. The original problem for k=0 uses Bertrand's postulate to find a prime in (n/2, n]. Here, the denominators are shifted by k. So maybe the interval (k +1, k +n) must contain a prime that's greater than n/2? Not sure. Alternatively, if we can adjust the original argument.\n\nAlternatively, consider the denominators k+1, k+2, ..., k+n. Let's consider the largest prime in this set. Suppose p is the largest prime in the denominators. Then p can't divide any other denominator because the next multiple would be p + p > k +n (since p ≤ k +n, 2p > k +n only if p > (k +n)/2). So if there's a prime p in ( (k +n)/2, k +n ], then p divides exactly one denominator. Then, using the same argument as in the harmonic series case, the sum cannot be an integer.\n\nThus, to apply Bertrand's postulate, we need that (k +n)/2 ≥ 2, so that there exists a prime between (k +n)/2 and k +n. Wait, but Bertrand's requires m ≥ 2, so if (k +n)/2 ≥ 2, i.e., k +n ≥ 4. But since k and n are positive integers, the smallest k +n can be is 2 (k=1, n=1). But in that case, the denominators are from 2 to 2, so the sum is 1/2, which isn't an integer. Similarly, for k=1, n=2: sum is 1/2 +1/3 = 5/6. So when k +n ≥4, we can apply Bertrand's. Wait, maybe the only edge cases are when k +n is small, but even then, the sum is a single term or two terms, which can't add up to an integer.\n\nWait, let's check. If k=1, n=1: sum=1/2, not integer. k=1, n=2: 1/2 +1/3 = 5/6. k=1, n=3: 1/2 +1/3 +1/4 = 13/12 ≈1.083, not integer. Similarly, k=2, n=1: 1/3. Not integer. So even for small n and k, the sum is not an integer. So perhaps the general argument using Bertrand's works for larger n and k, but for smaller ones, we can check manually.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let's consider the denominators again. Let's take the LCM of the denominators. The LCM will have certain prime factors. If there's a prime p that divides exactly one denominator, then the LCM has p in its factorization. When you express the sum over the common denominator, each term except one will have a numerator divisible by p, and the one term will have a numerator not divisible by p. Hence, the total numerator will not be divisible by p, making the entire sum not an integer.\n\nSo the key is to find such a prime p. The existence of such a prime is guaranteed if there's a prime in the interval (k +1, k +n] that is greater than (k +n)/2. Then, since the next multiple of p is 2p >k +n, so p only divides one term. By Bertrand's postulate, for m ≥2, there exists a prime p with m < p <2m. Let m= floor((k +n)/2). If m ≥2, then there exists a prime p in (m, 2m). Since 2m ≤k +n, as m= floor((k +n)/2). So p is in ( (k +n)/2 -1, k +n). Wait, floor((k +n)/2) might be less than (k +n)/2. For example, if k +n is odd, floor((k +n)/2) = (k +n -1)/2. Then 2m =k +n -1. So p is between (k +n -1)/2 and k +n -1. To ensure p is in the interval (k +1, k +n), we need that (k +n -1)/2 < p <k +n. If p is in this range, then since p > (k +n -1)/2, and k +n -1 ≥k +1 (since n≥2), then p would be greater than (k +n -1)/2 ≥(k +1 +1 -1)/2 =k/2 +0.5. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's take m=ceil((k +1 +k +n)/2) but this is not helpful. Maybe this approach is getting too tangled. Let's try to structure the problem as per the user's example.\n\nThe original problem states: Assume that k,n∈Z^+. Prove that the sum 1/(k+1) + ... +1/(k+n) is not an integer. The case k=0 is already proven. The assumptions here are that k and n are positive integers. The problem is to prove the sum is not an integer.\n\nSo in formatting, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nk is a positive integer,\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the sum\n1/(k+1) + 1/(k+2) + ... + 1/(k+n)\nis not an integer.\n\nBut the example given by the user had an extra assumption in the original problem. Wait, in their example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, no. Wait, the user's example is:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) =5^n(...) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, so in their example, the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. That seems incorrect. Wait, but looking back, perhaps the user made a mistake? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That changes the problem. That seems like an error. Wait, perhaps the user intended to present an example where they filtered out the problem, maybe there was a miscommunication.\n\nBut in the current problem, the original question says \"Assume that k,n∈Z^+\", so the formatted problem should list those as assumptions. The problem is to prove the sum is not an integer. The user's example might have been a different case where they had to include an assumption from the problem (even if it wasn't explicitly stated, but in this case, the assumptions are clear.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nk is a positive integer,\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the sum\n1/(k+1) + 1/(k+2) + ... + 1/(k+n)\nis not an integer.\n\nBut wait, the user's example had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was not in the original problem. Maybe there was a misunderstanding. In the example, perhaps the original problem had an error or required a specific condition. But in our current problem, the original question clearly states k and n are positive integers, and the problem is to prove the sum is not an integer. So the formatted problem should list those two assumptions and the problem as stated.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$k$ is a positive integer,\n$n$ is a positive integer.\nProblem:\nProve that the sum\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\dfrac{1}{k+1}+\\dfrac{1}{k+2}+\\ldots+\\dfrac{1}{k+n}\n\\end{equation*}\nis not an integer.",
