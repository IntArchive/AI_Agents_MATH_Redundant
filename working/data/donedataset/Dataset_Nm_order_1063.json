    "Content": "This is currently unsolved in the AoPS site, the problem says: Given postive integers $m$ and $n$, prove that there is a positive integer $c$ such that the numbers $cm$ and $cn$ have the same number of occurrences of each non-zero digit when written in base ten. I couldn't even give it a try, since I find this problem quite rare, but still very interesting. When they mention \"non-zero digits\" it makes me think that we may exploit this feature and direct all the colateral effects of multiplication to those zeroes. After that, I don't have a clear idea on what to do.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "As I mentioned in the comments, you can find the official solution here , though I think it isn't too illuminating. Also, I'm surprised that there's no discussion thread on AoPS for this problem... Anyway: As noted, when $m=1, n=2,$ the solutions to $c$ seem to always produce $mc$ and $nc$ that are cyclic shifts of one another, so it's natural to try to construct such a $c$ for all $m, n.$ Let's start with something easy. Take $A$ and $B$ to be positive integers, and suppose $B$ has the same digits as $A,$ except shifted by one to the left (so the first digit of $A$ is not the last digit of $B$). How can we think of $B?$ Well, the usual way of approaching problems concerning digits is to look at the decimal expansion and considering differences. In this case,  note that shifting every digit of $A$ to the left is the \"same\" as multiplying by $10.$ Now, it should be clear that $10A - B$ is in fact $(10^{n} - 1)\\cdot d,$ where $n$ is the number of digits in $A$ and $B,$ and $1\\le d\\le 9.$ In general, it is true that shifting by $s$ digits to the left implies $10^{s}A - B$ is divisible by $10^{n}-1,$ but we don't need this to solve our problem. What we're searching for is a way to force $cm$ and $cn$ to be cyclic shifts of one another. And the natural conjecture is the converse of our statement above. Namely, if $10^{n}-1\\mid 10^{s}A-B$ for some $s,$ then $B$ is equal to $A$ shifted by $s$ digits to the left. Let's prove this. Claim: Let $A$ and $B$ be positive integers such that the larger of the two has $n$ digits. If $10^{n}-1\\mid 10^{s}A-B$ for some $s \\ge 0,$ then $B$ is equal to the cyclic shift of $A$ by $s$ digits (to the left). Remark: We note that we can assume $s < n$ since $10^{n+s}A - 10^{s} A$ is automatically divisible by $10^{n}-1.$ Proof: Let $A = 10^{n-1}a_{n-1} + \\ldots + a_0$ and suppose $10^{s}A - 10^{n}d + d = B$ for some $s > 0$ and $d > 0$ ($s = 0$ is trivial). Then $$10^{s}A - 10^{n}d+d = 10^{n+s-1}a_{n-1} + \\ldots + 10^{n}a_{n-s} + \\ldots + 10^{s}a_0 - 10^{n}d + d = B < 10^{n}-1.$$ Now, observe that if we can produce $d$ such that the middle expression is between $0$ and $10^{n}-1,$ then it must be $B$ by the division algorithm. Taking $d = 10^{s-1}a_{n-1} + \\ldots + a_{n-s}$ yields $$10^{s}A - (10^{n}-1)d = 10^{n-1}a_{n-s-1} + \\ldots + 10^{s}a_0 + 10^{s-1}a_{n-1} + \\ldots + a_{n-s},$$ which is necessarily less than $10^{n}.$ Hence $B$ is obtained by shifting the digits of $A$ to the left by $s.$ From here, we want to find $c$ and $s$ such that $10^{s}cm - cn$ is divisible by $10^{N}-1,$ where $10^{N}-1 > cm, cn.$ Equivalently, we need $c(10^{s}m - n)$ to be divisible by $10^{N}-1.$ The easiest way to satisfy all the conditions is to make $10^{s}m-n$ divide by $10^{N}-1$ for some large $N,$ and then we can choose $c$ accordingly. Obviously, there is the caveat that $n$ may have a common factor with $10,$ but it's not difficult to remove this possibility. Hence, let $(n,10) = 1.$ Then take $s$ large enough so that $10^{s}m-n > m,n.$ Since $10^{s}m-n$ has no common factors with $10,$ there exists $N$ such that $10^{N} - 1$ is divisible by it (for example, $\\phi(10^{s}m-n)$ works). Now just take $c = \\dfrac{10^{N}-1}{10^{s}m-n}$ to finish. Note that $cm, cn < 10^{N}-1$ by assumption on $10^{s}m-n.$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The problem is from the 2013 USAMO, problem 5. The user wants me to structure it according to the given format. First, I need to parse the original question and extract the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe original problem states: Given positive integers m and n, prove that there exists a positive integer c such that the numbers cm and cn have the same number of occurrences of each non-zero digit when written in base ten. \n\nHmm, the key points here are that m and n are positive integers. The goal is to find a positive integer c (so c must also be positive) such that when you multiply m and n by c, the resulting numbers cm and cn have matching counts for each non-zero digit. \n\nThe example provided in the user's instruction had assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property of a single object. So here, the assumptions would be that m and n are positive integers. The problem is to prove the existence of such a c. \n\nWait, the original problem didn't state any additional conditions on m and n, just that they are positive integers. So the assumptions are straightforward: m and n are positive integers. The problem is to find a positive integer c with the digit condition. \n\nI need to make sure I'm not missing any implicit assumptions. The problem mentions base ten, but since that's part of the problem statement's requirement (how the numbers are written), it might not need to be an assumption. The assumptions are usually about the given conditions on the variables. So m and n are positive integers, and c must also be a positive integer. However, the problem statement already specifies that c is a positive integer, so perhaps the only assumptions are that m and n are given positive integers. \n\nLet me check the example again. In the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, the problem states m and n are positive integers. So each assumption should be a single line, each addressing one property. So I can list them as:\n\nAssumption:\nm is a positive integer,\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists a positive integer c such that the numbers cm and cn have the same number of occurrences of each non-zero digit when written in base ten.\n\nI think that's it. The user mentioned filtering unrelated information. The original question on Math Stack Exchange had some extra text about it being unsolved on AoPS and the user's thoughts, but those aren't part of the problem's assumptions. So the structured problem should just include the essential assumptions and the problem statement as given in the problem's official statement.",
