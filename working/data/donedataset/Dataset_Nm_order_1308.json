    "AcceptedAnswer": "First apply the substitution $x = t^3$. Then \\begin{align*}\nI_n\n&= \\int_{0}^{1} (1 + t^3 + \\cdots + t^{3n-3})^2 (1 + 4t^3 + \\cdots + (3n-2)t^{3n-3}) \\cdot 3t^2 \\, dt \\\\\n&= \\int_{0}^{1} 3 (t + t^4 + \\cdots + t^{3n-2})^2 (1 + 4t^3 + \\cdots + (3n-2)t^{3n-3}) \\, dt.\n\\end{align*} Now let $u = u(t) = t + t^4 + \\cdots + t^{3n-2}$. Then $$ 3 (t + t^4 + \\cdots + t^{3n-2})^2 (1 + 4t^3 + \\cdots + (3n-2)t^{3n-3}) = 3u^2 \\frac{du}{dt}.$$ Therefore $$ I_n = \\left[ u(t)^3 \\right]_{t=0}^{t=1} = u(1)^3 - u(0)^3 = n^3. $$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange problem into their specified structure. The example they provided involved listing each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object, then stating the problem.\n\nFirst, I need to read the original problem carefully. The title is about a definite integral equaling n³. The user's question is to prove that for all positive integers n, the integral I_n equals n³. The user also shared their attempt using generating functions and differentiation, but they're asking for better methods.\n\nNow, the task is to structure this problem into the given format. The Assumptions section should list all conditions, each on a separate line, applied to one object. The Problem section is the actual statement to prove.\n\nLooking at the original problem: the integral is from 0 to 1, involving the square of the sum S(n) (which is 1 + x + ... + x^{n-1}) multiplied by another sum (1 + 4x + ... + (3n-2)x^{n-1}). The conclusion is that this integral equals n³ for all positive integers n.\n\nSo, the assumptions here would be:\n\n1. n is a positive integer.\n2. The first sum S(n) is defined as 1 + x + x² + ... + x^{n-1}.\n3. The second sum is defined with coefficients 1, 4, 7, ..., (3n-2) for each power of x from 0 to n-1.\n4. The integral is computed from x = 0 to x = 1.\n\nEach of these is a separate condition. The first assumption is about n being a positive integer. The next two define the functions involved in the integral, and the fourth specifies the interval of integration. Each applies to one object: n, the first sum, the second sum, and the integral bounds respectively.\n\nSo, structuring that:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nS(n) is defined as $1 + x + x^2 + \\cdots + x^{n-1}$,\nthe second sum is defined as $1 + 4x + 7x^2 + \\cdots + (3n - 2)x^{n-1}$,\nthe integral is evaluated from $0$ to $1$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$I_n = \\int_0^1 \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^k \\right)^2 \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (3k + 1) x^k \\right) dx = n^3.$$\n\nWait, but in the original problem statement, the user wrote the second sum as 1 +4x +7x² +...+(3n-2)x^{n-1}. So for k from 0 to n-1, the coefficient is 3k +1? Let's check when k=0: 3(0)+1=1, k=1: 3(1)+1=4, yes. So the general term is (3k +1)x^k. However, when k goes up to n-1, the last term is 3(n-1)+1 = 3n -3 +1 =3n -2. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to write the second sum is sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (3k +1) x^k. So that's accurate.\n\nTherefore, the problem statement in the formatted version should include the integral with these sums squared and multiplied, leading to n³.\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is only one property. So \"n is a positive integer\" is one line. Then defining S(n) as the sum. Then defining the second sum. Then the integral bounds. Each is a separate line.\n\nThe problem is to prove the integral equals n³.\n\nSo putting it all together.",
