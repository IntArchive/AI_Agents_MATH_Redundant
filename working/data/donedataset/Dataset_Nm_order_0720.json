    "Content": "I found a nice formula of the following integral here $$\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^{\\alpha}dx}{1+2x\\cos\\beta +x^{2}}=\\frac{\\pi\\sin (\\alpha\\beta)}{\\sin (\\alpha\\pi)\\sin \\beta }$$ It states there that it can be proved by using contours method which I do not understand. It seems that the RHS is Euler's reflection formula for the gamma function but I am not so sure. Could anyone here please help me how to obtain it preferably ( if possible ) with elementary ways (high school methods)? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange problem into the specified format. The example they provided shows that assumptions should list each condition applied to one object, line by line, and then the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the original problem here: the question is about proving an integral formula. The integral is from 0 to infinity of x^α dx divided by (1 + 2x cosβ + x²), and the result is (π sin(αβ))/(sin(απ) sinβ). The user mentions they found the formula and want help proving it, preferably with elementary methods.\n\nNow, I need to extract the assumptions. The integral has parameters α and β. The problem probably has conditions on α and β for the integral to converge and for the formula to hold. For example, α might need to be between certain values, like -1 and 1, to ensure convergence at 0 and infinity. Also, β is likely in a specific range, maybe between 0 and π, since cosβ is involved, and the denominator becomes 1 + 2x cosβ + x², which is a quadratic in x. Also, the denominator should not be zero for real positive x, which relates to the discriminant. The discriminant is 4cos²β - 4*1*1 = 4(cos²β -1) = -4 sin²β, which is negative unless sinβ=0, but since sinβ is in the denominator of the result, β can't be 0 or π. So β is between 0 and π, not including 0 and π. Similarly, for the integral to converge at infinity, the exponent α needs to be such that x^α / x² ~ x^(α-2) tends to 0 as x→∞, so α -2 < -1 ⇒ α <1. At x near 0, x^α should be integrable, so α > -1. So assumptions would be α is between -1 and 1, β is between 0 and π, etc.\n\nWait, but the original problem doesn't specify these conditions. The user just states the integral equals that expression. But in the example given, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". Wait, no, the original problem in the example was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, the assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the example had a mistake? Wait, let me check the example again.\n\nThe original problem in the example says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem's assumption lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, that doesn't match. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds that n is divisible by 7. That seems like an error. Unless there was a miscommunication. Wait, maybe the user in the example made a mistake. Wait, maybe the original problem had a different condition. Hmm, perhaps the user intended to show how to structure even if there's a misassumption. But in any case, the task is to structure the current problem correctly.\n\nSo for the integral problem, the user didn't specify the conditions on α and β. But to state the problem correctly, we need to include the necessary assumptions for the integral to converge and for the formula to hold. So I should list those assumptions. The answer on Math Stack Exchange might mention that α is real, between -1 and 1, and β is between 0 and π. Also, maybe that α is not an integer to avoid the denominator sin(απ) being zero. Because if α is an integer, sin(απ) is zero, which would make the RHS undefined. So α must not be an integer. Similarly, sinβ ≠ 0, so β cannot be 0 or π. So assumptions:\n\n- α is a real number between -1 and 1 (exclusive)\n- α is not an integer\n- β is a real number between 0 and π (exclusive)\n\nEach of these should be separate lines. Also, maybe the integrand is defined for x > 0, but that's part of the integral's domain, so maybe not an assumption. So putting it all together, the assumptions are:\n\nα is a real number,\nα is between -1 and 1,\nα is not an integer,\nβ is a real number,\nβ is between 0 and π.\n\nEach condition on a separate line, applied to one object. Then the problem is to prove the integral equals the given expression.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nα is a real number,\nα is between -1 and 1,\nα is not an integer,\nβ is a real number,\nβ is between 0 and π.\n\nProblem:\nProve that\n$$\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^{\\alpha}dx}{1+2x\\cos\\beta +x^{2}}=\\frac{\\pi\\sin (\\alpha\\beta)}{\\sin (\\alpha\\pi)\\sin \\beta }$$",
