    "Content": "I am trying to prove the following, Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group and let $H$ be a proper subgroup. Then there exists a subgroup $H'$ such that \n  $$\nH\\lneq H'\\leq G\n$$\n  and $H\\triangleleft H'$. Obviously, the natural choice for $H'$ would be the normalizer $N_G(H)$ of $H$ in $G$. However, one needs to prove then that $H\\lneq N_G(H)$ in finite $p$-groups. I am aware of a proof of this fact by induction on the order of $G$. However, I was wondering if there was another proof which only used group actions?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Yes, you can do it with group actions. Of course we only need to worry about the case that $H$ is a non-identity proper subgroup. Let $H$ act on the right cosets of $H$ in $G$ by right translation. Since H is proper, the number of such cosets is divisible by $p.$ At least one of these is fixed by $H,$ namely the coset $H.$ There must be another orbit of size prime to $p,$ but since orbit sizes in this situation are powers of $p,$ the orbit size must be $1$. Hence there is some $g \\in G \\backslash H $ such that $Hgh = Hg$ for all $h \\in H.$ Then $gHg^{-1} \\leq H,$ so that $gHg^{-1} = H$ as both these subgroups have the same order. Hence $g \\in N_{G}(H) \\backslash H$ and $N_{G}(H) > H.$\n(Another standard proof not by induction is to use the upper central series).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to read the original question carefully.\n\nThe original question is about proving that in a finite p-group, every proper subgroup is properly contained in its normalizer. The user mentions they know an induction proof but want an alternative using group actions.\n\nNow, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. The example provided shows that each assumption should be a single condition on one object. Let's parse the problem:\n\nThe problem states: Let G be a finite p-group, H a proper subgroup. Need to show there's H' such that H < H' ≤ G and H is normal in H'. The proposed approach is using the normalizer N_G(H), so the key is to show H is strictly contained in N_G(H).\n\nAssumptions here would be:\n1. G is a finite p-group.\n2. H is a proper subgroup of G.\n\nEach assumption is a separate line, addressing one property of one object. So G is finite p-group, H is a proper subgroup. The problem is to prove the existence of H' as described, which they want to do via normalizer argument using group actions.\n\nSo structuring this into the format:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a finite p-group,\nH is a proper subgroup of G.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a subgroup H' such that H < H' ≤ G and H is normal in H'.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me check the example again. In the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Each on separate lines. Here, similarly, two separate assumptions: G is finite p-group, and H is proper subgroup. The problem is to find H' with those properties. The original problem mentions using normalizer and group actions, but the formatted problem should just state the problem without the extra context. So the final answer should list those assumptions and the problem statement.",
