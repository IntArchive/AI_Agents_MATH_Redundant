Motivation: Prove that $\\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt[3]{2}] = \\{a+b\\sqrt[3]{2}+c(\\sqrt[3]{2})^2\\;|\\;a,b,c\\in\\mathbb{Q}\\}$ forms a field.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user has two main questions here. The first one is to show that the determinant of a specific 3x3 matrix is non-zero given that a, b, c are rational numbers and not all zero. The determinant given is a³ + 2b³ - 6abc + 4c³. The second question is about proving the linear independence of {1, ∛2, (∛2)²} over ℚ, which relates to showing that ℚ[∛2] is a field.\n\nStarting with the first problem: the determinant. The matrix in question is:\n```\n| a   2c  2b |\n| b   a   2c |\n| c   b   a  |\n```\nThey calculated the determinant as a³ + 2b³ - 6abc + 4c³. The user wants to show that if a, b, c are not all zero, this determinant is non-zero. The context is that this determinant being non-zero ensures that the system of equations for finding the multiplicative inverse in ℚ[∛2] has a unique solution, which is necessary for proving it's a field.\n\nSo, the key assumption here is that a, b, c are rational numbers and not all zero (since a² + b² + c² ≠ 0). The problem is to show that under these conditions, the determinant is non-zero. That would imply the matrix is invertible, hence the system has a unique solution, which in turn would mean that every non-zero element has an inverse in ℚ[∛2], making it a field.\n\nNow, the second part: linear independence of {1, ∛2, (∛2)²} over ℚ. The user mentions that if they can show this linear independence, then the set forms a basis, and the structure ℚ[∛2] is indeed a field. The usual way to show linear independence of such elements is to assume a linear combination equals zero and show all coefficients must be zero. Since ∛2 is a root of x³ - 2, which is irreducible over ℚ by Eisenstein's criterion (p=2), the polynomial is minimal, and hence {1, ∛2, (∛2)²} are linearly independent.\n\nBut the user is asking for the easiest way to argue this. Since the minimal polynomial has degree 3, the extension degree [ℚ(∛2) : ℚ] is 3, which means those three elements form a basis, hence they are linearly independent. However, maybe the user is looking for a more elementary approach without invoking field extensions. Alternatively, suppose there exist rationals a, b, c such that a + b∛2 + c(∛2)² = 0. If not all a, b, c are zero, then ∛2 would satisfy a quadratic equation, which contradicts that x³ - 2 is irreducible over ℚ (since it would imply the minimal polynomial has degree ≤2, but it's actually 3). Therefore, such a, b, c must all be zero.\n\nBack to the determinant problem. To show that a³ + 2b³ - 6abc + 4c³ ≠ 0 when a, b, c are rational and not all zero. Maybe factor the expression? Let's see. Let me try plugging in some values. Suppose c = 0. Then the determinant becomes a³ + 2b³. If a³ + 2b³ = 0, then (a/b)³ = -2, which would imply a/b is irrational unless a = b = 0. But since a, b are rational, the only solution is a = b = 0. So if c = 0, then determinant is zero only if a and b are also zero. But since c = 0, that would make all a, b, c zero, which is excluded. Hence, determinant non-zero.\n\nSimilarly, if a = 0, then determinant is 2b³ + 4c³ - 0. If 2b³ + 4c³ = 0, then same logic: (b/c)³ = -2, implying b/c is irrational unless b = c = 0. So again, determinant zero only when b = c = 0, which is excluded.\n\nBut the general case. Maybe the determinant can be written as a³ + 2b³ + 4c³ - 6abc. This resembles the form of a cubic in variables a, b, c. Wait, this looks similar to the expansion of (a + b∛2 + c∛4)³? Not exactly. Alternatively, maybe factor using some identity. For example, a³ + 2b³ + 4c³ - 6abc. Let me see if this factors. Suppose it factors as (a + k b + m c)(...). Let me attempt to factor it. Let's assume it factors into linear terms. But coefficients are 2 and 4. Alternatively, perhaps over complex numbers, but we need to see over rationals. Alternatively, since 2 and 4 are coefficients, maybe relate to the minimal polynomial of ∛2. Since x³ - 2 = 0, so ∛2 satisfies x³ = 2. If we consider substituting a, b, c in terms of variables multiplied by this root, maybe there's a connection. Wait, the determinant expression a³ + 2b³ +4c³ -6abc is similar to the norm in the field extension ℚ(∛2). The norm of an element a + b∛2 + c∛4 would be the product of its conjugates. Since the minimal polynomial is x³ - 2, the conjugates are ∛2, ω∛2, ω²∛2 where ω is a primitive cube root of unity. However, since we are in real numbers, maybe the norm is different. Wait, but in the field ℚ(∛2), the norm of an element a + b∛2 + c∛4 is the product of all its Galois conjugates. However, since the extension is not Galois (it's not normal), but the norm can still be considered. Alternatively, maybe the determinant given is the norm. If that's the case, then the norm being non-zero would correspond to the element being non-zero, which would imply the determinant is non-zero. But since a, b, c are rational, and the element a + b∛2 + c∛4 is non-zero (as not all a, b, c are zero), then its norm should be non-zero. Therefore, the determinant is the norm, hence non-zero.\n\nAlternatively, since the determinant is equal to the product of the eigenvalues, but perhaps that's not helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe if we suppose that the determinant is zero, then there exists a non-trivial solution (d, e, f) to the equation M*(d, e, f)^T = (1, 0, 0)^T. Wait, but the determinant being zero would mean the matrix is singular, so the system might not have a solution or have infinitely many. However, the user's original problem is that to find the inverse, they need a unique solution, which requires the determinant to be non-zero. So if the determinant is zero, then there is no inverse, which would contradict the field requirement. Therefore, by needing the inverse to exist, the determinant must be non-zero. But how do we show that determinant is non-zero given a² + b² + c² ≠ 0?\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the determinant as a³ + 2b³ +4c³ -6abc, perhaps assume that this equals zero. Then a³ + 2b³ +4c³ = 6abc. If a, b, c are rational, can this equation hold unless a = b = c = 0?\n\nThis seems similar to the equation in the context of the sum of cubes. If we can show that the only rational solution is a = b = c = 0, then the determinant is non-zero otherwise. Suppose there is a non-trivial solution. Let’s suppose a, b, c are integers (by clearing denominators). Then a³ + 2b³ +4c³ = 6abc. Let me try small integers. If a, b, c are 0, it works. Otherwise, maybe some scaling. Suppose there is a solution where a, b, c are integers with no common factor. Let’s look modulo 2. Then LHS: a³ mod 2, since 2b³ and 4c³ are 0 mod 2. So a³ ≡ 0 mod 2 ⇒ a ≡ 0 mod 2. Let a = 2a'. Then equation becomes (2a')³ + 2b³ +4c³ = 6*(2a')bc. 8a'³ + 2b³ +4c³ = 12a'bc. Divide both sides by 2: 4a'³ + b³ + 2c³ = 6a'bc. Now, look modulo 2: 4a'³ ≡ 0, b³ ≡ b, 2c³ ≡ 0. So equation modulo 2: 0 + b + 0 ≡ 0 ⇒ b ≡ 0 mod 2. So b = 2b'. Substitute: 4a'³ + (2b')³ + 2c³ = 6a'(2b')c. 4a'³ + 8b'³ + 2c³ = 12a'b'c. Divide by 2: 2a'³ +4b'³ +c³ =6a'b'c. Now look modulo 2: 2a'³ ≡0, 4b'³≡0, c³ ≡c. So equation modulo 2: c ≡0 mod 2. Thus c = 2c'. Substitute: 2a'³ +4b'³ + (2c')³ =6a'b'(2c'). 2a'³ +4b'³ +8c'³ =12a'b'c'. Divide by 2: a'³ +2b'³ +4c'³ =6a'b'c'. Notice this is the original equation again, but with a', b', c' instead of a, b, c. Thus, by infinite descent, the only solution is a = b = c =0. Hence, the only integer solution is a = b = c =0. Therefore, for rationals, scaling by common denominator would lead to the same conclusion. Therefore, the determinant is zero only when a = b = c =0. Hence, if a² +b² +c² ≠0, determinant is non-zero.\n\nTherefore, the determinant is non-zero whenever a, b, c are not all zero. Hence, the first problem is solved by this argument. For the second question, linear independence follows from the minimal polynomial of ∛2 being degree 3, hence any non-trivial combination would give a lower degree polynomial, contradicting irreducibility.\n\nSo, structuring the problem according to the user's format, the assumptions are that a, b, c are rational numbers, not all zero (since a² + b² + c² ≠0). The problem is to show the determinant is non-zero. The second question is about linear independence, but the user's main focus seems to be the determinant part, as the linear independence is needed for the determinant argument.",
