    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The problem is to show that for any integer n ≥ 2, n does not divide 2ⁿ - 1. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the problem is asking. It says that for n starting from 2 upwards, when you compute 2 raised to the power of n and subtract 1, the result isn't divisible by n. So, 2ⁿ -1 modulo n should not be zero. \n\nThe user mentioned they tried induction and Fermat's little theorem but didn't get far. Let me think about possible approaches. \n\nStarting with small values of n to see if there's a pattern or possible counterexamples. Let's check n=2: 2² -1 = 3. Does 2 divide 3? No, 3/2 is 1.5, so that's good. n=3: 2³ -1 =7. 3 doesn't divide 7. n=4: 2⁴ -1=15. 4 doesn't divide 15. n=5:31, which 5 doesn't divide. n=6:63. 63 divided by 6 is 10.5, so no. n=7:127. 7*18=126, so 127-126=1, not divisible. So far, it's holding. \n\nWait, but maybe there's a composite number where this could fail? Wait, maybe n is a prime number. Wait, let's check n=341. Wait, 341 is known as a pseudoprime to base 2. Let's see: 2³⁴⁰ ≡ 1 mod 341? If that's true, then 341 divides 2³⁴⁰ -1, but 341 divides 2³⁴¹ -2? Wait, but the problem is about n dividing 2ⁿ -1. So if n is a pseudoprime to base 2, then n divides 2ⁿ -1. But 341 is such a number. So 341 divides 2³⁴¹ -1. But 341 is 11*31. Wait, that contradicts the problem statement. But the problem says for n ≥2, n does not divide 2ⁿ -1. But 341 is a composite number that does divide 2³⁴¹ -1. So this would be a counterexample. But maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me check 341. According to Fermat's little theorem, since 341 is 11*31, if 341 divides 2³⁴⁰ -1, but 2¹⁰ ≡1 mod 11 (since 2¹⁰=1024 ≡1 mod 11, because 11*93=1023, so 1024=1023+1 ≡1 mod 11). So 2¹⁰ ≡1 mod 11. Then 2³⁴⁰ = (2¹⁰)^34 ≡1^34 ≡1 mod 11. Similarly, 2³⁰ ≡1 mod 31, since 31 is prime, so by Fermat, 2³⁰ ≡1 mod 31. Then 340 divided by 30 is 11 with a remainder of 10. So 2³⁴⁰ = 2^(30*11 +10) = (2³⁰)^11 * 2^10 ≡1^11 * 2^10 mod 31. 2^10 is 1024. 1024 mod 31: 31*33=1023, so 1024 ≡1 mod 31. So 2³⁴⁰ ≡1*1=1 mod 31. Therefore, by Chinese remainder theorem, 2³⁴⁰ ≡1 mod 341. Therefore, 2³⁴⁰ ≡1 mod 341, so 2³⁴¹ ≡2 mod 341. Wait, that would mean 2³⁴¹ -1 ≡1 mod 341, so 341 divides 2³⁴¹ -1? Wait, no. Wait, 2³⁴⁰ ≡1 mod 341 implies 2³⁴¹ ≡2 mod 341, so 2³⁴¹ -1 ≡1 mod 341, which means 341 does not divide 2³⁴¹ -1. Wait, but I thought 341 was a pseudoprime. Maybe I confused the exponent. Let me check again.\n\nWait, a pseudoprime to base 2 is a composite number n such that 2^(n-1) ≡1 mod n. So for n=341, it's 2³⁴⁰ ≡1 mod 341. Therefore, 2³⁴⁰ -1 is divisible by 341. But the problem here is about n dividing 2ⁿ -1. So 341 divides 2³⁴¹ -1? Wait, if 2³⁴⁰ ≡1 mod 341, then multiplying both sides by 2 gives 2³⁴¹ ≡2 mod 341, so 2³⁴¹ -1 ≡1 mod 341. Therefore, 341 does not divide 2³⁴¹ -1. Hmm, so maybe 341 is not a counterexample. Then maybe I was wrong. So maybe the original problem is correct. Let's check another pseudoprime. For example, 561 is a Carmichael number. Let's check 2⁵⁶⁰ mod 561. Since 561 is 3*11*17. For each prime p in factors, check 2⁵⁶⁰ mod p. For p=3: 2² ≡1 mod3, so 2⁵⁶⁰=(2²)^280≡1^280=1 mod3. For p=11: 2¹⁰ ≡1 mod11, so 2⁵⁶⁰=(2¹⁰)^56≡1^56=1 mod11. For p=17: 2¹⁶ ≡1 mod17, so 2⁵⁶⁰=(2¹⁶)^35≡1^35=1 mod17. Thus, by Chinese remainder theorem, 2⁵⁶⁰≡1 mod561. Therefore, 2⁵⁶⁰ -1 is divisible by 561. But the problem is about n dividing 2ⁿ -1. So 561 divides 2⁵⁶¹ -1? Let's see. If 2⁵⁶⁰≡1 mod561, then 2⁵⁶¹=2⁵⁶⁰ *2 ≡1*2=2 mod561. Therefore, 2⁵⁶¹ -1 ≡1 mod561. Thus, 561 does not divide 2⁵⁶¹ -1. Therefore, even though 561 is a Carmichael number, it doesn't divide 2ⁿ -1. So maybe the problem's statement is correct. Then there are no composite numbers n where n divides 2ⁿ -1? Wait, but what about primes? Let's take a prime p. If p is an odd prime, then by Fermat's little theorem, 2^{p-1} ≡1 mod p. So 2^{p} ≡2 mod p. Therefore, 2^{p} -1 ≡1 mod p. Thus, p does not divide 2^{p} -1. Therefore, for primes p ≥2, p does not divide 2^p -1. For example, p=3:2^3-1=7, which 3 doesn't divide. For p=5:31, which 5 doesn't divide. So primes don't divide 2^p -1. Then what about composite numbers? Suppose n is composite. Then we need to show that n doesn't divide 2^n -1. \n\nWait, but there might be composite numbers n where n divides 2^n -1. If such numbers exist, then the problem's statement is false. However, according to my earlier calculation with n=341 and 561, they do not divide 2^n -1. But perhaps there exists another composite number. Let's check n=341 again. Wait, 341 is 11*31. Let's compute 2^341 mod 11 and 31. For mod11: 2^10≡1 mod11, so 341 divided by 10 is 34 with remainder 1. So 2^341=2^(10*34 +1)= (2^10)^34 *2^1 ≡1^34 *2=2 mod11. So 2^341 -1≡1 mod11. Therefore, 11 doesn't divide 2^341 -1. Similarly, mod31: 2^5=32≡1 mod31. So 2^5≡1, so 341 divided by 5 is 68 with remainder 1. 2^341=2^(5*68 +1)= (2^5)^68 *2^1 ≡1^68 *2=2 mod31. So 2^341 -1≡1 mod31. Therefore, 31 doesn't divide 2^341 -1. Since both 11 and 31 don't divide 2^341 -1, then 341=11*31 doesn't divide it either. So even though 341 is a pseudoprime to base 2 (divides 2^340 -1), it doesn't divide 2^341 -1. \n\nWait, maybe there's a composite number n that divides 2^n -1. Let's check n=91=13*7. Let's compute 2^91 mod7 and mod13. For mod7: 2^3=8≡1 mod7. So 91=3*30 +1. So 2^91=(2^3)^30 *2^1 ≡1^30 *2=2 mod7. So 2^91 -1≡1 mod7. Therefore, 7 doesn't divide. For mod13: 2^12≡1 mod13. 91 divided by 12 is 7 with remainder 7. So 2^91=(2^12)^7 *2^7 ≡1^7 *128 mod13. 128 mod13: 13*9=117, 128-117=11. So 2^91≡11 mod13. Then 2^91 -1≡10 mod13. So 13 doesn't divide. Therefore, 91 doesn't divide 2^91 -1. \n\nHmm. Maybe there are no composite numbers where n divides 2^n -1. If that's the case, then the problem's statement is correct. So how do we prove that for all n ≥2, n does not divide 2^n -1. \n\nLet me consider two cases: n is prime and n is composite. \n\nCase 1: n is prime. Then by Fermat's little theorem, 2^{n-1} ≡1 modn. Therefore, 2^n =2^{n-1}*2 ≡1*2=2 modn. Hence, 2^n -1≡1 modn. So n does not divide 2^n -1. \n\nCase 2: n is composite. We need to show that n does not divide 2^n -1. Suppose, for contradiction, that n is composite and n divides 2^n -1. Let p be the smallest prime divisor of n. Then since n is composite, p ≤ sqrt(n). Now, since p divides n, and n divides 2^n -1, then p divides 2^n -1. Therefore, 2^n ≡1 modp. \n\nBut by Fermat's little theorem, 2^{p-1}≡1 modp. Let d be the order of 2 modulo p. Then d divides p-1 and d divides n (since 2^n≡1 modp). Therefore, d divides gcd(n, p-1). Since p is the smallest prime divisor of n, and n is composite, then all other prime divisors of n are ≥p. Thus, p-1 must be less than p, and since p is the smallest prime factor of n, the gcd(n, p-1) must divide some factors of p-1. But p-1 and n are coprime? Wait, because any common divisor of n and p-1 must be a divisor of p-1, but since p is the smallest prime divisor of n, any such divisor would have to be 1, because p-1 is less than p and p is the smallest prime factor. Therefore, gcd(n, p-1)=1. Therefore, the order d divides 1, which implies d=1. Thus, 2^1≡1 modp, which implies 2≡1 modp, so p divides 1, which is impossible. Therefore, our assumption that n divides 2^n -1 leads to a contradiction. Therefore, no composite n can divide 2^n -1. \n\nHence, combining both cases, for all n ≥2, n does not divide 2^n -1. \n\nSo the key idea was to consider the smallest prime divisor of n and use properties of the order of 2 modulo p. The problem might require this approach. The user mentioned trying induction and Fermat's little theorem but didn't get further. The correct approach seems to involve using the order of an element and properties of divisors in composite numbers. \n\nNow, structuring the problem as per the required format. The original question states: For n ≥2, show that n does not divide 2ⁿ -1. The assumptions here are that n is an integer and n is at least 2. The problem is to show that n does not divide 2ⁿ -1. So according to the example, the assumption should list each condition on one line. The problem statement is straightforward. \n\nBut wait, in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the given problem here, the assumption is n ≥2. So in the formatted problem, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption: \nn is an integer,\nn is greater than or equal to 2.\n\nProblem: Show that n does not divide 2ⁿ -1.\n\nYes, that's correct. The problem doesn't have any other hidden assumptions; it's general for all integers n ≥2.",
