    "Content": "I'm trying to prove that the following group has infinite order: $$H=\\langle a,b\\mid a^{3}=b^{3}=(ab)^{3}=1\\rangle.$$ Currently I'm checking on some cases using the relations, but my problem is the reducibility for large products. Naively I started to check that $ab$ is different than $1,a,b$ and then $ba$ than $1,a,b,ab$ , just to understand $H$ in some extent. Now I'm wondering about some more effective method to prove that $|H|=\\infty$ , I'm tempted to look for an injection from some group of infinite order into $H$ , but I'm still stuck. More than asking for a solution I'd rather appreciate some hints or thoughts about it. Thanks a lot.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Consider an equilateral triangle in the plane and let $r$, $s$ and $t$ be the motions of the plane given by reflection with respect to each of the sides of the triangle. Then $a=rs$ is a rotation of angle $2\\pi/3$ around the vertex of the triangle which is the intersection of the sides with respect to which $r$ and $s$ reflect. Similarly, $b=st$ is a rotation of that same angle around another of the vertices, and so is $c=rt$. Notice that $a^3=b^3=c^3$ and that $c=ab$. It follows that there is a surjective group homomorphism from your group to the subgroup of the group $\\Gamma$ of motions of the plane generated by the three rotations $a$, $b$ and $c$. To show your group is infinite it is enough to show that $\\Gamma$ has an infinite orbit in the plane, and you can do this by making pictures :-) Later. It is important to note that this is not a random fact. The group generated by the three reflections on the sides of my triangle, which has presentation $\\langle r, s, t: r^2=s^2=t^2=(rs)^3=(st)^3=(tr)^3\\rangle$ is what we call a Coxeter group, and the subgroup generated by the three rotations $a$, $b$ and $c$ is its positive part. This type of group is very well-known, and a Google search will show.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. First, I need to identify all the assumptions mentioned in the problem. The group H is defined by the presentation ⟨a, b | a³ = b³ = (ab)³ = 1⟩. The goal is to prove that H has infinite order.\n\nLooking at the original question, the assumptions are the generators a and b with the relations a³ = 1, b³ = 1, and (ab)³ = 1. Each of these relations applies to different elements: a, b, and the product ab respectively. The problem is to show that despite these relations, the group H isn't finite.\n\nI need to list each assumption on a separate line. So, the three relations are separate assumptions. Each applies to a specific element or product: a³=1 for a, b³=1 for b, and (ab)³=1 for ab. There's no mention of any other constraints like specific values of a and b or other relations. The problem statement is straightforward as given.\n\nWait, the original question mentions the user tried checking cases and is looking for hints. But for formatting, we just need the core assumptions and problem. So, the assumptions are the three relations, each on their own line. The problem is to prove H has infinite order. That's it. Let me double-check the example provided. In the example, assumptions were listed as separate lines for each condition. So here, each relation is a separate assumption. Yes, that makes sense.",
