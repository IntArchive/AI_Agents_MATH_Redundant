    "Content": "I thought this was easy until I realized that for a set to be well-ordered, EACH of it's non-empty subsets must have a least element. Let $A$ be a non-empty totally ordered set. Let $x_0$ be some element of $A$. Define $S=\\{x\\in A|x\\ge x_0\\}$. $x_0 \\in S$ so $S$ isn't empty. Now, this seems like it would work. It certainly is totally ordered and cofinal in $A$, but it might not be well-ordered. For example, if $A=\\mathbb R$ then $(x_0 + 1, x_0 + 2)$ (where $()$ denotes an open interval) is a non-empty subset of $S$, but doesn't have a least element.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $\\langle X,\\le\\rangle$ be a non-empty linear order. If $X$ has a maximum element $x_0$, then $\\{x_0\\}$ is a well-ordered cofinal subset, so assume that $X$ has no largest element. Let $$\\mathscr{W}=\\{W\\subseteq X:\\langle W,\\le\\rangle\\text{ is a well-order}\\}\\;,$$ and define a relation $\\preceq$ on $\\mathscr{W}$ by setting $W_0\\preceq W_1$ if and only if $W_0$ is an initial segment of $W_1$. Prove that $\\preceq$ partially orders $\\mathscr{W}$. Prove that every chain in $\\langle\\mathscr{W},\\preceq\\rangle$ has an upper bound in $\\mathscr{W}$. Prove that a $\\preceq$-maximal element of $\\mathscr{W}$ is a well-ordered cofinal subset of $\\langle X,\\le\\rangle$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement. \n\nLooking at the original question: The user is trying to prove that every totally ordered set has a well-ordered cofinal subset. They mentioned that they initially thought taking S = {x ∈ A | x ≥ x₀} would work but realized it might not be well-ordered, using the example of A = ℝ where the open interval (x₀ +1, x₀ +2) in S has no least element.\n\nSo the main problem is to prove that in any totally ordered set A, there exists a cofinal subset that's well-ordered. The assumptions would be about the properties of A and the required conditions for the subset. Let me break down the assumptions:\n\n1. A is a non-empty totally ordered set. (Given in the problem statement)\n2. The cofinal subset must be well-ordered. (From the problem requirement)\n3. The subset needs to be cofinal in A. (Cofinal means that for every element in A, there's an element in the subset that is greater or equal)\n\nWait, the assumptions should list the conditions given in the problem. The problem doesn't state any additional conditions like A being well-ordered itself, just that it's totally ordered. The user's example shows that their initial approach with S doesn't work because S might not be well-ordered. So the problem is under the assumption that A is a totally ordered set, and we have to construct a cofinal subset that's well-ordered.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should include that A is a non-empty totally ordered set, and the problem is to prove the existence of a well-ordered cofinal subset. The user's mistake was assuming the set S they defined was well-ordered, but in reality, it might not be. So the problem needs to be structured with those assumptions.\n\nLet me check the example again. In the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But in the original problem here, there are no such additional constraints except that A is a totally ordered set. So the assumptions here should just be that A is a non-empty totally ordered set. The problem is to show that there exists a well-ordered cofinal subset of A.\n\nWait, the original question starts with \"Prove that every totally ordered set has a well-ordered cofinal subset.\" So the problem is stated clearly. The assumptions are that A is a totally ordered set. But in the user's attempt, they considered A=ℝ as a specific case. But in the general problem, the only assumption is that A is a totally ordered set. So in the formatted problem, the assumption would be \"A is a non-empty totally ordered set.\" Then the problem is to prove that A has a well-ordered cofinal subset.\n\nThe user's example in the question is just illustrating why their initial approach failed. So when structuring, we need to filter out that example and just present the core assumptions and problem. Therefore, the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a non-empty totally ordered set.\n\nProblem:\nProve that every totally ordered set has a well-ordered cofinal subset.\n\nBut wait, the user's original problem statement says \"every totally ordered set\", which includes non-empty ones. So maybe the assumption is redundant since the problem says \"every\", but perhaps to structure it correctly, the assumption is that A is a totally ordered set. But the problem as stated is \"Prove that every totally ordered set has...\", so maybe the assumption isn't needed? Wait, in the example given, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7, but in the original problem, the user had to include that. Wait, perhaps in this case, the problem is to prove for every totally ordered set, so the assumption is that we're considering any totally ordered set. But how to phrase it?\n\nWait, the format requires listing all assumptions. The problem is to prove that for every totally ordered set A, there exists a cofinal subset that's well-ordered. So the assumption is that A is a totally ordered set, and we have to prove the existence. So the assumption line would be \"A is a totally ordered set,\" and the problem is to prove that A has a well-ordered cofinal subset.\n\nBut the user's initial problem statement says \"every integer n\", and the formatted assumption lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem's assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, the original problem in the example was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem lists assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\", which seems incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\". Wait, that example might have a mistake. Let me check.\n\nOriginal example: The original problem is to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like a mistake. Because if the original problem is for every integer n, then the assumption shouldn't include n divisible by 7. Unless the user made a mistake in the example. Maybe the example was actually a modified problem where the divisibility by 7 was added? Hmm. Perhaps there was a miscommunication in the example. But regardless, for the current problem, the user's question is about proving that every totally ordered set has a well-ordered cofinal subset.\n\nTherefore, the assumption is that A is a totally ordered set. The problem is to prove that A has a well-ordered cofinal subset. The user's attempt and example are just part of the problem's context, but in structuring the problem, we need to state the assumption and problem clearly.\n\nWait, but the problem statement in the user's question is: \"Prove that every totally ordered set has a well-ordered cofinal subset.\" So the problem is as stated, and the assumption would be that A is a totally ordered set. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a totally ordered set.\n\nProblem:\nProve that A has a well-ordered cofinal subset.\n\nBut the original question mentions that A is non-empty. The user writes \"Let A be a non-empty totally ordered set.\" So perhaps the assumption should include that A is non-empty. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a non-empty totally ordered set.\n\nProblem:\nProve that A has a well-ordered cofinal subset.\n\nYes, because the problem statement in the user's question starts with \"every totally ordered set\", but in their reasoning, they consider A non-empty. But in mathematics, a totally ordered set can be empty, but the problem might only consider non-empty ones. Since the user explicitly says \"Let A be a non-empty totally ordered set,\" perhaps the assumption is that A is non-empty and totally ordered. Therefore, that should be the assumption line.\n\nSo the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a non-empty totally ordered set.\n\nProblem:\nProve that A has a well-ordered cofinal subset.\n\nYes, that makes sense. The user's example in their question uses A=ℝ, which is non-empty. So the key assumptions are that A is non-empty and totally ordered. The problem is to show there's a well-ordered cofinal subset. The rest of the user's text is their failed attempt and example, which we can filter out as per the instructions.",
