    "AcceptedAnswer": "You're almost there. So, you have chosen a $P_0\\in Syl_p(H)$ such that $P\\cap H\\le P_0$. Then, we have $P_0\\le gPg^{-1}$. Also, $P_0\\le H$, so, as $gHg^{-1}=H$, it means\n$$g^{-1}P_0\\,g\\le P\\cap H\\,.$$\nAssuming everything is finite, by calculating sizes, we are ready, as $|g^{-1}P_0\\,g|=|P_0|$ and both are included in $H$, so $|P\\cap H|=|P_0|$ also follows.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants to show that if G is a group, P is a Sylow p-subgroup of G, and H is a normal subgroup of G, then the intersection P ∩ H is a Sylow p-subgroup of H. \n\nFirst, let me recall some Sylow theorem basics. The Sylow theorems tell us about the existence, conjugacy, and number of Sylow p-subgroups in a finite group. The second theorem states that any two Sylow p-subgroups are conjugate, and the third gives constraints on the number of such subgroups. \n\nThe user started by taking a Sylow p-subgroup P of G and a normal subgroup H. They then considered a Sylow p-subgroup P₀ of H. Since P ∩ H is a p-subgroup of H (because P is a p-group and H is a subgroup), by Sylow's second theorem, P ∩ H must be contained in some conjugate of P₀. Wait, actually, Sylow's second theorem in H would imply that P ∩ H is contained in some Sylow p-subgroup of H, which is P₀ here. But the user mentions that there exists g in G such that P₀ ≤ gPg⁻¹. How does that happen?\n\nHmm, since H is normal in G, any Sylow p-subgroup of H can be related to Sylow p-subgroups of G. Maybe they used the fact that since P₀ is a Sylow p-subgroup of H, and H is normal in G, then by Sylow's theorems in G, there exists a Sylow p-subgroup of G, say Q, such that P₀ ≤ Q. But since all Sylow p-subgroups of G are conjugate, Q = gPg⁻¹ for some g in G. So P₀ ≤ gPg⁻¹. But then they want to connect this back to P ∩ H.\n\nWait, the user is trying to show that P ∩ H is itself a Sylow p-subgroup of H. They have that P ∩ H is contained in P₀ (a Sylow p-subgroup of H) and they have P₀ contained in some conjugate of P. But since H is normal, maybe conjugating P by an element of G would still intersect H in a Sylow p-subgroup. However, since H is normal, conjugating P by an element of G would give another Sylow p-subgroup of G, but intersecting with H might still relate to H's Sylow subgroups.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a more straightforward approach. Let me think. Since H is normal in G, the intersection P ∩ H is a p-subgroup of H. To show it's a Sylow p-subgroup, we need to show that its order is equal to the maximal p-power dividing the order of H. \n\nThe order of P is the highest power of p dividing |G|, say |P| = p^k, where p^k divides |G| and p^{k+1} does not. Then |H| divides |G| because H is a subgroup, so the highest power of p dividing |H| is p^m where m ≤ k. Since P ∩ H is a subgroup of both P and H, its order is a power of p, say p^s. We need to show that s = m. \n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the order of intersections in normal subgroups. There's a formula that |PH| = |P||H| / |P ∩ H|. Since H is normal, PH is a subgroup of G. Then |PH| divides |G|. Since P is Sylow in G, |PH| must be divisible by p^k, the order of P. But |PH| = |P||H| / |P ∩ H|, so p^k divides (p^k * |H|) / |P ∩ H|. Simplifying, this implies that |P ∩ H| divides |H|. But |P ∩ H| is a p-subgroup of H, so its order is p^s. To be Sylow in H, p^s must be the maximal power dividing |H|. \n\nWait, maybe another angle. Since H is normal, the Sylow p-subgroups of H are exactly the intersections of Sylow p-subgroups of G with H. That is a theorem I recall. So if H is normal in G, then for any Sylow p-subgroup P of G, P ∩ H is a Sylow p-subgroup of H. That would directly answer the problem. But I need to verify why that theorem holds.\n\nLet me check. Suppose H is normal in G, and P is a Sylow p-subgroup of G. Then PH/H is a Sylow p-subgroup of G/H, by the correspondence theorem. But also, the order of PH is |P||H| / |P ∩ H|. Since P is Sylow in G, |P| is the maximal p-power in |G|. Then |P ∩ H| must be the maximal p-power in |H|, because if there was a larger p-subgroup in H, then P would not be maximal in G. Alternatively, since |P ∩ H| is a p-subgroup of H, and if H's Sylow p-subgroup has order p^m, then |P ∩ H| ≤ p^m. But also, since H is normal, every Sylow p-subgroup of H is of the form Q ∩ H where Q is a Sylow p-subgroup of G. So P ∩ H should be Sylow in H. \n\nAlternatively, using the Frattini argument. If H is normal in G, then G = H * N_G(P₀) where P₀ is a Sylow p-subgroup of H. But maybe that's more complicated. \n\nGoing back to the user's approach. They took P₀ as a Sylow p-subgroup of H. Then since P ∩ H is a p-subgroup of H, P ∩ H ≤ P₀. Then they want to show that P₀ ≤ P ∩ H. If they can do that, then P₀ = P ∩ H, hence P ∩ H is Sylow in H. \n\nThey mention that there exists g ∈ G such that P₀ ≤ gPg⁻¹. Because P₀ is a p-subgroup of G (since it's a subgroup of H, which is a subgroup of G), and since P is a Sylow p-subgroup, P₀ is contained in some conjugate of P. So P₀ ≤ gPg⁻¹. Since H is normal in G, gPg⁻¹ ∩ H = g(P ∩ H)g⁻¹, because conjugation preserves intersections with normal subgroups. Wait, H is normal, so gHg⁻¹ = H. Therefore, gPg⁻¹ ∩ H = gPg⁻¹ ∩ gHg⁻¹ = g(P ∩ H)g⁻¹. \n\nBut P₀ is contained in H, so P₀ ≤ gPg⁻¹ ∩ H = g(P ∩ H)g⁻¹. Since conjugation preserves the order, |g(P ∩ H)g⁻¹| = |P ∩ H|. So P₀ is contained in a conjugate of P ∩ H. But P ∩ H was already contained in P₀. Wait, this seems like a circular argument. \n\nAlternatively, since P₀ ≤ gPg⁻¹, then P₀ is contained in both H and gPg⁻¹. Therefore, P₀ ≤ H ∩ gPg⁻¹ = g (g⁻¹Hg) ∩ P g⁻¹. But since H is normal, g⁻¹Hg = H, so H ∩ gPg⁻¹ = g (H ∩ P) g⁻¹. Therefore, P₀ ≤ g (H ∩ P) g⁻¹. But since conjugation is an isomorphism, the order of P₀ is less than or equal to the order of H ∩ P. But earlier, we had that H ∩ P is contained in P₀, so their orders must be equal, hence H ∩ P is a Sylow p-subgroup of H. \n\nWait, that might be the key. If P₀ ≤ g (H ∩ P) g⁻¹, then |P₀| ≤ |H ∩ P|. But we already had H ∩ P ≤ P₀, so |H ∩ P| ≤ |P₀|. Therefore, |H ∩ P| = |P₀|, so H ∩ P is a Sylow p-subgroup of H. Therefore, H ∩ P is Sylow in H. \n\nSo the user's approach can be completed by noting that the containment in both directions gives equality. Therefore, P ∩ H is Sylow in H. \n\nAlternatively, another way to see it is by considering the orders. Let |G| = p^k m where p does not divide m. Since H is normal, |H| divides |G|, so |H| = p^l n where l ≤ k and n divides m. Then the Sylow p-subgroup of H has order p^l. Now, P has order p^k, and H has order p^l n. The intersection P ∩ H is a subgroup of both P and H, so its order is a power of p, say p^s. We need to show s = l. \n\nBy the formula |PH| = |P||H| / |P ∩ H|. Since H is normal, PH is a subgroup of G, so |PH| divides |G|. Therefore, p^k m' = (p^k * p^l n) / p^s, where m' is some integer dividing m. Simplifying, p^{k + l - s} n divides p^k m, which implies that p^{l - s} n divides m. Since n divides m and p does not divide m, we must have l - s ≤ 0, so l ≤ s. But since P ∩ H is a p-subgroup of H, s ≤ l. Hence s = l. Therefore, |P ∩ H| = p^l, which is the order of a Sylow p-subgroup of H. Thus, P ∩ H is a Sylow p-subgroup of H. \n\nThis seems to be a solid argument. So the key steps are using the formula for the order of the product PH when H is normal, and then showing that the intersection must have the correct order. \n\nAlternatively, using the fact that in a normal subgroup H, the Sylow p-subgroups of H are exactly the intersections of the Sylow p-subgroups of G with H. This is a standard result in group theory, often proven using the Frattini argument or through order considerations as above. \n\nIn any case, the problem requires showing that P ∩ H is Sylow in H, given that P is Sylow in G and H is normal. The user's approach was to take a Sylow p-subgroup P₀ of H, note that P ∩ H ≤ P₀, then find a conjugate of P containing P₀, and then show that this implies P₀ ≤ P ∩ H. By leveraging the normality of H and the Sylow theorems, this leads to the conclusion that P ∩ H = P₀, hence is Sylow.",
