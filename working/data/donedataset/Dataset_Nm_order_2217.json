    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants an example of a continuous function f: Q → Q that's not uniformly continuous, along with a Cauchy sequence in Q whose image under f isn't Cauchy. They specifically asked if squaring a Cauchy sequence in Q might result in a non-Cauchy sequence, but they suspect that might not be the case and think the function should be one that's continuous on Q but not on R.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the definitions. A function is uniformly continuous if for every epsilon > 0, there exists a delta > 0 such that for all x, y in the domain, |x - y| < delta implies |f(x) - f(y)| < epsilon. If a function isn't uniformly continuous, this delta can't be chosen independently of x. \n\nContinuous functions on Q that aren't uniformly continuous usually have to do with behavior that becomes \"steeper\" as they approach an irrational point not in Q. For example, consider a function that blows up near a hole in Q. But since Q is dense in R, maybe something like f(x) = 1/(x - sqrt(2)) is not defined on all Q, because when x approaches sqrt(2) in Q, the denominator approaches zero. Wait, but sqrt(2) isn't in Q, so maybe this function is continuous on Q? Wait, but the problem states the function is from Q to Q. So f(x) = 1/(x - sqrt(2)) would map Q to R, but not necessarily to Q. So that might not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a function that oscillates wildly near a missing point. But how to ensure the codomain is still Q? That's tricky. Another thought: maybe a function like f(x) = x^2 is uniformly continuous on bounded subsets of Q but not on the entire Q. Wait, but x^2 is uniformly continuous on any bounded interval. However, on the entire Q, it's not uniformly continuous because the derivative becomes unbounded. But in Q, even if we go to infinity, sequences going to infinity aren't Cauchy, so maybe that's not the right direction.\n\nWait, the user mentioned the example of x^2. They ask if there exists a Cauchy sequence in Q such that when squared, the sequence isn't Cauchy. Let's think. Take a Cauchy sequence in Q converging to sqrt(2) in R. For example, x_n is a sequence of rationals approaching sqrt(2). Then x_n^2 approaches 2, which is a real number. But in Q, the sequence x_n^2 would be a Cauchy sequence because it converges to 2 in R, and Cauchyness is preserved under continuous functions in complete spaces. But Q isn't complete. Wait, but if the sequence x_n is Cauchy in Q, then x_n^2 is also Cauchy in Q? Because in R, x_n^2 converges to 2, so it's Cauchy in R, hence in Q as well. Therefore, x_n^2 is Cauchy. So the squaring function might not be the example here. Hence, the user is right that it's weird, and the counterexample must come from another function.\n\nSo, maybe a different function. Let's think of a function that's continuous on Q but not uniformly continuous. A classic example is f(x) = x^2 on R is not uniformly continuous, but on Q, is it uniformly continuous? Wait, uniform continuity depends on the domain. If the domain is, say, a bounded interval in Q, then x^2 would be uniformly continuous there. But if the domain is all of Q, then perhaps not. However, Cauchy sequences in Q that are bounded would have their images under x^2 also Cauchy, but maybe if the sequence is unbounded? But unbounded sequences aren't Cauchy. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, consider a function that is continuous on Q but has a discontinuity at an irrational point when extended to R. For example, consider f(x) defined on Q as follows: f(x) = 0 if x < sqrt(2), and f(x) = 1 if x > sqrt(2). This function is continuous on Q because in Q, around any point not equal to sqrt(2), you can find intervals where the function is constant. But sqrt(2) isn't in Q, so every point in Q has a neighborhood where f is constant, hence continuous. However, this function is not uniformly continuous because you can take two sequences approaching sqrt(2) from below and above in Q; their images under f would be 0 and 1, respectively. If you take a Cauchy sequence in Q that approaches sqrt(2), like alternating terms from below and above, but getting closer, then the function applied to this sequence would alternate between 0 and 1, hence not Cauchy. \n\nWait, let's make this precise. Let x_n be a sequence in Q such that x_n approaches sqrt(2), with terms alternately less than and greater than sqrt(2). For example, take a sequence that converges to sqrt(2) in R, and interleave terms from below and above. Then x_n is Cauchy in Q because it converges in R. But f(x_n) alternates between 0 and 1, which is not a Cauchy sequence because the terms don't get closer to each other. Thus, this f is continuous on Q (since it's locally constant), not uniformly continuous, and the image of the Cauchy sequence x_n is not Cauchy.\n\nBut wait, does this function map Q to Q? The problem states f: Q → Q. In the example above, f(x) is either 0 or 1, which are in Q, so yes. So this would work. The function f is continuous on Q because every rational point is either strictly less than sqrt(2) or strictly greater, and in either case, there's a neighborhood around it in Q where f is constant. Hence, f is continuous. However, it's not uniformly continuous because, as mentioned, for epsilon = 1/2, no matter how small delta is, there exist points x, y within delta of each other (approaching sqrt(2)) where |f(x) - f(y)| = 1.\n\nSo the Cauchy sequence x_n approaching sqrt(2) in Q would have f(x_n) alternating between 0 and 1, hence not Cauchy. Therefore, this is a valid example. \n\nBut let me check continuity again. For any x in Q, if x < sqrt(2), then there's an interval around x in Q where all points are less than sqrt(2), so f is 0 there, hence continuous. Similarly for x > sqrt(2). So yes, f is continuous everywhere on Q.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be: \n\n- f: Q → Q is defined by f(x) = 0 if x < sqrt(2), f(x) = 1 if x > sqrt(2).\n- {x_n} is a Cauchy sequence in Q converging to sqrt(2) in R.\n\nProblem: Show that {f(x_n)} is not a Cauchy sequence.\n\nAlternatively, the problem as stated in the original question is to find such a function and a Cauchy sequence. The user's specific question was whether taking squares would work, but we saw that squaring a Cauchy sequence converging to sqrt(2) in Q would result in a Cauchy sequence converging to 2. Therefore, the square function isn't the example here; instead, a function with a jump at an irrational point, defined on Q, would work.\n\nSo structuring this into the required format:\n\nAssumptions need to be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition on one object.\n\nThe function f is defined piecewise, continuous on Q, not uniformly continuous. The Cauchy sequence {x_n} converges to sqrt(2) in R, hence is Cauchy in Q, but {f(x_n)} alternates between 0 and 1, hence not Cauchy.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would include:\n\n- f: Q → Q is defined by f(x) = 0 for x < sqrt(2), f(x) = 1 for x > sqrt(2).\n- f is continuous on Q.\n- f is not uniformly continuous on Q.\n- {x_n} is a Cauchy sequence in Q converging to sqrt(2) in R.\n\nBut according to the example provided, the problem part is just the problem statement, while the assumptions list the conditions. However, the original problem asks to prove the existence, so the assumptions would be the conditions given in the problem. Wait, the user's example included the assumptions as the problem's given conditions. Let's check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted problem included an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, actually, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake there. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like an error. Perhaps the example was not correctly formatted.\n\nWait, maybe the example is that the user wanted to filter out unrelated information. Wait, in the original problem, the user might have had a different assumption, but the example given might have been part of their own structuring. Anyway, the key is that the \"Assumption\" section lists all the assumptions of the problem, each as a single line.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question is to prove that there exists a continuous function f: Q→Q, not uniformly continuous, and a Cauchy sequence {x_n} in Q such that {f(x_n)} is not Cauchy. More particularly, the user is asking if squaring could be such a function, but the counterexample is instead a function that's continuous on Q but not uniformly continuous, like the piecewise function around sqrt(2).\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- f: Q → Q is defined by f(x) = 0 if x < sqrt(2), f(x) = 1 if x > sqrt(2).\n- {x_n} is a Cauchy sequence in Q that converges to sqrt(2) in R.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to show the existence, so the assumptions might not include the specific function, unless the problem is to verify this example. But the original problem is asking to construct such an example. Therefore, the assumptions would be the conditions given in the problem statement, not the example's components.\n\nWait, the original problem says: There exists a continuous function f: Q→Q, not uniformly continuous, and a Cauchy sequence {x_n} in Q such that {f(x_n)} is not Cauchy. The user then asks if squaring would work, but suggests maybe a function continuous on Q but not on R.\n\nSo the formatted problem should capture the original problem's requirements. The user wants to structure the problem into assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe original problem is to prove the existence of such a function and sequence. So the assumptions are the conditions that need to be met, which are:\n\n- f: Q → Q is continuous.\n- f is not uniformly continuous.\n- {x_n} is a Cauchy sequence in Q.\n- {f(x_n)} is not a Cauchy sequence.\n\nBut the user wants the assumptions listed as separate points. However, the problem is to show the existence, so maybe the assumptions are the given conditions, but in this case, the problem is to construct the example, so the assumptions might be inherent properties (like Q is not complete, etc.), but perhaps not. The example given in the user's initial example added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem, which was a mistake. So maybe the user's example is incorrect, but we need to follow their format.\n\nIn their example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem added an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, which actually changes the problem. That seems like an error. So perhaps the user intended to extract the necessary conditions from the problem statement. For the current problem, the assumptions should be the given conditions. The original problem states: There exists a continuous function f: Q→Q, not uniformly continuous, and a Cauchy sequence {x_n} in Q such that {f(x_n)} is not Cauchy. So the assumptions here are:\n\n- f: Q → Q is continuous.\n- f is not uniformly continuous.\n- {x_n} is a Cauchy sequence in Q.\n- The problem is to show that {f(x_n)} is not Cauchy.\n\nBut actually, the problem is to prove the existence, so the assumptions are the properties that need to be satisfied, and the problem is to show that such an f and {x_n} exist. However, in the user's example, they rephrased the problem, possibly incorrectly. To adhere to the user's format, perhaps the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem statement, each listed as separate points. However, the problem as stated is to prove existence, so perhaps there are no explicit assumptions beyond the general context (like working in Q, etc.), but the user's example included assumptions from the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to construct such an example, the assumptions might be the general properties required for the function and sequence. For instance:\n\nAssumption:\n- f is a function from Q to Q.\n- f is continuous but not uniformly continuous.\n- {x_n} is a Cauchy sequence in Q.\n\nProblem:\nProve that {f(x_n)} is not a Cauchy sequence.\n\nBut the original problem is to show the existence, not to prove for a given f and {x_n}. Therefore, perhaps the correct formatting is:\n\nAssumption:\n- There exists a function f: Q → Q that is continuous but not uniformly continuous.\n- There exists a Cauchy sequence {x_n} in Q.\n\nProblem:\nShow that {f(x_n)} is not a Cauchy sequence.\n\nBut that seems not precise. The actual problem is to show that there exists such f and {x_n} with those properties. Therefore, the problem statement is to construct or prove the existence, so the assumptions might be the general conditions under which the problem is posed, such as working within the rational numbers, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions are the properties that the function and sequence must satisfy, and the problem is to prove their existence. But the user's example seems to have transformed the original problem's conditions into assumptions, possibly erroneously. Given that the user included in their example an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem, I think they may have intended to extract hidden assumptions or conditions from the problem statement.\n\nIn the current problem, the key assumptions are:\n\n- f: Q → Q is continuous.\n- f is not uniformly continuous.\n- {x_n} is a Cauchy sequence in Q.\n\nAnd the problem is to show that {f(x_n)} is not Cauchy.\n\nBut the original problem is to prove that such f and {x_n} exist. Therefore, the formatted problem should reflect that. However, following the user's example, which rephrased the problem with added assumptions, perhaps we should list the necessary conditions as assumptions.\n\nWait, the user's example seems to have misunderstood the original problem. The original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, changing the problem. That seems incorrect. Maybe the user intended to filter out unrelated information but made a mistake. Therefore, in the current problem, we need to list the assumptions as given in the problem statement, each on one line.\n\nThe problem statement is: There exists a continuous function f: Q→Q, not uniformly continuous, and a Cauchy sequence {x_n} in Q such that {f(x_n)} is not Cauchy.\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n- f: Q → Q is continuous.\n- f is not uniformly continuous.\n- {x_n} is a Cauchy sequence in Q.\n\nProblem: Show that {f(x_n)} is not a Cauchy sequence.\n\nBut the actual task is to prove the existence of such f and {x_n}. Therefore, the problem is to \"Prove that there exists a continuous function f: Q→Q, which is not uniformly continuous, and a Cauchy sequence {x_n} in Q such that {f(x_n)} is not a Cauchy sequence.\"\n\nBut according to the user's example, the formatted problem should list the assumptions and then the problem. So in the user's example, the original problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem included assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, leading to the problem to prove A(n) divisible by 91. But this seems like a mistake because the original problem's assumption was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an extra condition. Therefore, perhaps the user intended to extract the necessary conditions from the problem, possibly focusing on key aspects.\n\nGiven that, perhaps in the current problem, the key assumptions are:\n\n- f is a function from Q to Q.\n- f is continuous but not uniformly continuous.\n- {x_n} is a Cauchy sequence in Q.\n\nProblem: Show that {f(x_n)} is not a Cauchy sequence.\n\nHowever, the original problem is about existence, so maybe the problem statement is to \"Prove that there exists a continuous function f: Q→Q, not uniformly continuous, and a Cauchy sequence {x_n} in Q such that {f(x_n)} is not a Cauchy sequence.\"\n\nBut according to the user's instructions, the task is to structure the problem into Assumption and Problem parts, filtering unrelated information. The original question mentions the user's thoughts about x^2 and whether the counterexample should be with a function continuous on Q but not on R.\n\nSo the relevant assumptions from the problem are:\n\n- f: Q → Q is continuous.\n- f is not uniformly continuous.\n- {x_n} is a Cauchy sequence in Q.\n\nProblem: Show that {f(x_n)} is not a Cauchy sequence.\n\nAlternatively, to match the example, perhaps the assumptions are the properties that the problem states, and the problem is the actual question. The original problem is to prove the existence, so the assumptions are the conditions required for the existence. But I'm a bit confused because the user's example seems to have added an extra assumption. Given that, perhaps the safest way is to list the key conditions as assumptions and then state the problem.\n\nIn the original problem, the key conditions are:\n\n1. f is a function from Q to Q.\n2. f is continuous.\n3. f is not uniformly continuous.\n4. {x_n} is a Cauchy sequence in Q.\n\nThe problem is to show that {f(x_n)} is not a Cauchy sequence.\n\nBut actually, the problem is to show the existence of such f and {x_n}. Therefore, the problem statement should be: \"Prove that there exists a continuous function f: Q→Q, which is not uniformly continuous, and a Cauchy sequence {x_n} in Q such that {f(x_n)} is not a Cauchy sequence.\"\n\nBut according to the user's example, the problem part is just the statement to prove, and the assumptions are the given conditions. In their example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but that seems incorrect. It should have been that n is an integer, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. The added assumption that n is divisible by 7 is wrong. Therefore, perhaps the user's example is flawed, but we should follow the structure.\n\nFor the current problem, the original question is asking to prove the existence of f and {x_n} with the stated properties. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- f: Q → Q is continuous.\n- f is not uniformly continuous.\n- {x_n} is a Cauchy sequence in Q.\n\nProblem: Show that {f(x_n)} is not a Cauchy sequence.\n\nBut actually, the problem is to show that such f and {x_n} exist. Therefore, the problem statement is: \"Prove that there exists a continuous function f: Q→Q, not uniformly continuous, and a Cauchy sequence {x_n} in Q such that {f(x_n)} is not a Cauchy sequence.\"\n\nBut according to the user's format, the problem part is the actual question, and assumptions are the given conditions. However, in this case, the problem is to construct such an example, so the assumptions are the properties that the example must satisfy. Therefore, the assumptions would include the function being continuous on Q, not uniformly continuous, and the sequence being Cauchy in Q. The problem is to show the image sequence isn't Cauchy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions are the general context: working in Q, continuous functions, etc., but the user's example suggests listing specific conditions. Given the confusion from the example, perhaps the best approach is to follow the structure even if imperfect.\n\nIn the user's example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, leading to the problem to prove divisibility by 91. That seems like a mistake because the original problem's conclusion (divisible by 91) would require that 91 divides A(n) for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an extra condition on n (divisible by 7). However, 91 = 13*7, so maybe the original proof required n divisible by 7, but the problem statement didn't specify that. Anyway, perhaps the user intended to break down the problem's conditions into assumptions.\n\nGiven that, for the current problem, the assumptions should be:\n\n- f: Q → Q is continuous.\n- f is not uniformly continuous.\n- {x_n} is a Cauchy sequence in Q.\n\nProblem: Prove that {f(x_n)} is not a Cauchy sequence.\n\nBut actually, the problem is to show the existence of such f and {x_n}, so the assumptions might be inherent properties (like Q is not complete, f is continuous but not uniformly continuous), but since the user's example extracted conditions from the problem statement, perhaps the correct approach is to list the properties that need to be established as assumptions.\n\nWait, the user's original example was incorrect, but we have to follow their structure regardless. Therefore, for the current problem, the assumptions would be the conditions given in the problem statement:\n\n- There exists a continuous function f: Q→Q.\n- f is not uniformly continuous.\n- There exists a Cauchy sequence {x_n} in Q.\n\nProblem: Prove that {f(x_n)} is not a Cauchy sequence.\n\nBut the problem is to show the existence of f and {x_n} such that {f(x_n)} is not Cauchy. Therefore, the problem statement is to \"Prove that there exists a continuous function f: Q→Q, not uniformly continuous, and a Cauchy sequence {x_n} in Q such that {f(x_n)} is not a Cauchy sequence.\"\n\nBut according to the user's format, the problem part is the actual question. Hence, the assumptions are the given conditions, and the problem is what needs to be proven. However, in this case, the problem is to prove existence, so the assumptions might be the general properties (like Q is dense in R, etc.), but perhaps the user wants the key conditions from the problem statement listed.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I think the safest way is to list the key components from the problem statement as assumptions and then state the problem as proving the consequence. However, since the example seems to have added an extra assumption, perhaps the user expects us to extract specific conditions. For instance, the function is continuous on Q but not uniformly continuous, and the sequence is Cauchy in Q. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\n- $f: \\mathbb{Q} \\to \\mathbb{Q}$ is continuous.\n- $f$ is not uniformly continuous.\n- $\\{x_n\\}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $\\{f(x_n)\\}$ is not a Cauchy sequence.\n\nBut this is not accurate because the problem is to show the existence, not to prove for a given f and {x_n}. Therefore, the correct problem statement is to prove the existence, which requires constructing such f and {x_n}. Hence, the assumptions would be the properties required for f and {x_n}, and the problem is to show their existence with the desired property. But how to fit that into the format?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem as structured should be:\n\nAssumption:\n- $f: \\mathbb{Q} \\to \\mathbb{Q}$ is continuous but not uniformly continuous.\n- $\\{x_n\\}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $\\{f(x_n)\\}$ is not a Cauchy sequence.\n\nBut again, this implies that given such f and {x_n}, show the consequence, whereas the original problem is to prove that such f and {x_n} exist.\n\nGiven the user's example, which incorrectly added an assumption, I think the best approach here is to list the key components of the problem as assumptions and then state the problem as the original question. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\n- $f: \\mathbb{Q} \\to \\mathbb{Q}$ is continuous.\n- $f$ is not uniformly continuous.\n- $\\{x_n\\}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $\\{f(x_n)\\}$ is not a Cauchy sequence.\n\nHowever, the actual problem is to show that such f and {x_n} exist, not to take them as assumptions. This seems conflicting. Given the confusion from the user's example, I think the intended structure is to extract the key conditions from the problem statement as assumptions and then state the problem. Therefore, given the original problem asks to prove the existence, the assumptions would be the general context (like working in Q), and the problem is to prove the existence. But since the user's example added specific assumptions, perhaps we should do similarly.\n\nAlternatively, considering the user's specific question in the problem: they asked whether the counterexample involves a function continuous on Q but not on R, and if x^2 would work. The answer is that x^2 is continuous on Q and R, but not uniformly continuous on Q (if considered on the entire Q). However, as discussed earlier, x^2 preserves Cauchy sequences in Q. Therefore, the counterexample must be a different function, like the piecewise function around sqrt(2).\n\nTherefore, the structured problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- $f: \\mathbb{Q} \\to \\mathbb{Q}$ is defined by $f(x) = 0$ if $x < \\sqrt{2}$, $f(x) = 1$ if $x > \\sqrt{2}$.\n- $\\{x_n\\}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $\\mathbb{Q}$ converging to $\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $\\{f(x_n)\\}$ is not a Cauchy sequence.\n\nThis captures the specific example that serves as the counterexample. The assumptions list the function and the sequence, and the problem is to show the image sequence isn't Cauchy. The user's original problem asks for such an example, so structuring it this way provides the specific case to prove.",
