    "Content": "Suppose $M$ be a connected manifold and $x, y \\in M$ are two points. Then I'm trying to show that there is a diffeomeorphism $f$ of $M$ that takes $x$ to $y$. Since the set of points for which there is a diffeomorphism of $M$ taking $x$ to that point is clopen and $M$ is connected, I think it should be enough to consider the case when both $x$ and $y$ lie in the same chart. But how do I proceed from here? I think I should somehow take a vector field and consider flows, but I'm not really sure. Can someone please provide a solution? Thanks in advance.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Fix $y \\in M$ and define $S_y := \\{ x \\in M \\, | \\, \\exists \\phi \\in \\mathrm{Diff}_c(M), \\phi(x) = y \\}$. The set $S_y$ is non-empty (because $y \\in S_y$). Let us show that $S_y$ is closed and open. Two properties follow immediately from the definitions: $x \\in S_y$ if and only if $y \\in S_x$. If $x' \\in S_x$ and $x \\in S_y$ then $x' \\in S_y$. Given $x \\in M$, one can find an open subset $U \\subseteq M$ and a chart $\\varphi \\colon U \\rightarrow B(0,1)$ around $x$ with $\\varphi(x) = \\textbf{0}$. Here, $B(\\textbf{0},1) \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\\varphi = (x^1, \\ldots, x^n)$.  Given $x' \\in U$, denote by $\\textbf{c} = \\varphi(x')$ the coordinates of $x'$ and choose some $||\\textbf{c}|| < r < 1$. The \"constant\" vector field $X = c^i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}$ is well-defined on $U$, and by multiplying $X$ with a bump-function, one can extend $X$ to a globally defined, compactly supported, vector field $\\tilde{X}$ with $\\tilde{X}|_{\\varphi^{-1}(B(0,r))} = X$. Since $\\tilde{X}$ has compact support, it generates a globally defined flow $\\phi_t$. The curve $\\gamma(t) = \\varphi^{-1}(t\\textbf{c})$ (for $t \\in [0,1]$) is an integral curve of $\\tilde{X}$ satisfying $\\gamma(0) = x$ and $\\gamma(1) = x'$ which implies that $\\phi_1(x) = x'$. Thus, $x \\in S_x'$ and $x' \\in S_x$. Now, let $x \\in S_y$. Choosing $U$ as above, we see that for all $x' \\in U$ we have $x' \\in S_x$ which implies that $x' \\in S_y$ and so $S_y$ is open. Finally, if $x_n \\in S_y$ and $x_n \\rightarrow x$, then choosing $U$ around $x$ as above, we have $x_n \\in S_y$ and $x_n \\in U$ for some $n$, which implies that $x \\in S_{x_n}$ and so $x \\in S_y$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions and the problem statement from the original question.\n\nThe original question is about proving that in a connected manifold M, for any two points x and y, there exists a diffeomorphism f of M such that f(x) = y. The user mentioned using the fact that the set of points reachable by a diffeomorphism from x is clopen, hence the whole manifold due to connectedness. They then narrow it down to the case where x and y are in the same chart and mention using vector fields and flows but are unsure how to proceed.\n\nNow, applying the required format. The assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. The problem is the main statement to prove.\n\nAssumptions from the problem:\n1. M is a connected manifold. (This is a key condition given in the problem.)\n2. x and y are two points in M. (The problem states x, y ∈ M.)\n\nThe problem is to show there exists a diffeomorphism f: M → M such that f(x) = y.\n\nWait, in the original problem, the user says \"the set of points for which there is a diffeomorphism of M taking x to that point is clopen and M is connected\". So maybe they considered that the set is non-empty (since x can be taken to x by the identity), clopen, hence the whole manifold. But in the formatted problem, the assumptions should be only the given conditions, not the steps of the proof. The user's approach is part of their thought process, not the problem's assumptions.\n\nSo the problem's assumptions are just that M is a connected manifold and x, y are points in M. The problem is to prove there's a diffeomorphism taking x to y.\n\nI need to check if there are more assumptions. The user also mentions considering the case where x and y lie in the same chart, but that's part of their attempt, not the problem's given conditions. Therefore, the assumptions in the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nM is a connected manifold,\nx and y are points in M.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a diffeomorphism $f$ of $M$ such that $f(x) = y$.\n\nWait, but in the example provided, the assumption included \"$n$ is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". However, in that example, the formatted problem included an additional assumption which wasn't in the original. Wait, no, looking back: the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption was \"$n$ is an integer, $n$ is divisible by 7\". Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, perhaps the example was wrong? Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Wait, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem's assumption lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But that would mean the problem is to prove divisibility by 91 under the assumption that n is divisible by 7, which might not be the original intention. But perhaps the example was incorrect, but the user provided it as their own example. So maybe in their example, they added an extra assumption. But in our case, we have to follow the user's instructions to extract the assumptions from the original problem, not the user's attempt.\n\nIn the current problem, the original problem states: \"Suppose M be a connected manifold and x, y ∈ M are two points. Then I'm trying to show that there is a diffeomorphism f of M that takes x to y.\" So the assumptions are M is connected, M is a manifold, x and y are points in M. But in the problem statement, \"connected manifold\" is a single condition. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nM is a connected manifold,\nx and y are points in M.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a diffeomorphism $f$ of $M$ such that $f(x) = y$.\n\nThat seems correct. The user's attempt mentions considering the same chart, vector fields, flows, but those are part of their solution approach, not the problem's assumptions. Therefore, the formatted problem should only include the given conditions from the problem statement, not the user's attempt steps.",
