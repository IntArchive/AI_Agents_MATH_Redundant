    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement from the original question.\n\nThe original problem is to prove that for every natural numbers n ≥ m ≥ 1, the expression (gcd(n,m)/n) * binomial(n,m) is an integer. The user mentioned an example where assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. \n\nLooking at the problem, the key elements are the natural numbers n and m with the condition n ≥ m ≥ 1. The main object here is the binomial coefficient adjusted by the gcd term. The assumptions should include the nature of n and m (being natural numbers), their relationship (n ≥ m), and perhaps the gcd condition. However, in the example provided, the assumption included specific conditions like divisibility. Here, the problem states \"for every n ≥ m ≥1 natural numbers,\" so the assumptions should reflect that. \n\nWait, in the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, the problem is more general. The variables n and m are natural numbers with n ≥ m ≥1. So each of these should be separate assumptions. Also, the gcd(n,m) is part of the expression but not an assumption; the problem is to prove the expression is an integer given those conditions. So the assumptions are just the conditions on n and m.\n\nSo, the problem statement is to prove that (gcd(n,m)/n) * binomial(n,m) is an integer. The assumptions are that n and m are natural numbers, and n is at least m, which is at least 1. Each of these should be separate lines in the assumptions.\n\nI need to make sure there are no other hidden assumptions. The problem mentions that it's from the 2000 Putnam exam, B-2, but that's part of the original question's context and not an assumption. So the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumptions:\nn and m are natural numbers,\nn ≥ m,\nm ≥ 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$\\frac{\\gcd(n,m)}{n} \\cdot \\binom{n}{m}$$ is an integer.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included a divisibility condition. Here, the problem's assumptions are just the ranges of n and m. So each of those three points: n and m are natural numbers (but since m is part of the binomial coefficient, maybe they are integers, but the problem states natural numbers). Wait, the original problem says \"for every n ≥ m ≥1 natural numbers\", so the assumptions are n and m are natural numbers, and n ≥ m, and m ≥ 1. However, m ≥1 is redundant if n ≥ m and m is a natural number, because m can't be less than 1 if it's a natural number. But perhaps the user wants to list each condition as separate. So maybe the three assumptions are:\n\n- n is a natural number,\n- m is a natural number,\n- n ≥ m ≥ 1.\n\nBut in the example, the user split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, perhaps \"n and m are natural numbers\" can be one line, and then \"n ≥ m\" as another. But wait, the example split each condition into separate lines even if they apply to the same object. For example, in the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are separate. So here, \"n is a natural number\", \"m is a natural number\", \"n ≥ m\", \"m ≥ 1\". But since natural numbers start at 1, m being a natural number already implies m ≥1, so \"m ≥1\" is redundant. However, the problem states \"n ≥ m ≥1\", which might be emphasizing that m is at least 1. To follow the example's structure, perhaps list each condition even if some are implied. But maybe the problem just needs the necessary assumptions. Let me check the original problem statement again.\n\nOriginal problem: \"for every $n\\geq m \\geq1$ natural numbers\". So the conditions are n and m are natural numbers, and n ≥ m, and m ≥1. Even though m being natural implies m ≥1, the problem explicitly states m ≥1, so perhaps it's safer to list it as an assumption. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a natural number,\nm is a natural number,\nn ≥ m,\nm ≥ 1.\n\nBut maybe combining the inequalities? No, the example separates each condition. For example, in the example, the user had two separate lines: \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Similarly, here, each inequality is a separate assumption. Wait, but n ≥ m and m ≥1 are two separate conditions. So each should be a separate line.\n\nBut maybe \"n and m are natural numbers\" can be combined into one line, then n ≥ m, then m ≥1. But in the example, they had separate lines for each property even if applied to the same object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a natural number,\nm is a natural number,\nn ≥ m,\nm ≥ 1.\n\nBut m being a natural number already implies m ≥1. But the problem statement explicitly includes m ≥1, so maybe it's better to list it. Alternatively, since natural numbers start at 1, m is a natural number implies m ≥1, so the m ≥1 is redundant. But the user in the example included the divisibility condition, which is a specific property. Here, the problem states \"n ≥ m ≥1\", so perhaps the user wants to include m ≥1 as a separate assumption. To adhere strictly to the original problem's phrasing, it's better to include all stated conditions as separate assumptions. Therefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n1. n is a natural number,\n2. m is a natural number,\n3. n ≥ m,\n4. m ≥ 1.\n\nBut again, 4 is redundant given 2. But since the problem states \"n ≥ m ≥1\", perhaps the user wants to list all four. Alternatively, maybe combine n and m as natural numbers in one line. Wait, in the example, the user had \"n is an integer\" as a separate line. So perhaps each object's property is a line. So:\n\nn is a natural number,\nm is a natural number,\nn ≥ m,\nm ≥ 1.\n\nBut again, m ≥1 is redundant. However, to match the problem's explicit conditions, I'll include all four. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem's \"for every n ≥ m ≥1 natural numbers\" can be parsed as n and m are natural numbers with n ≥ m and m ≥1. So maybe the first two assumptions are n and m are natural numbers, then n ≥ m, then m ≥1. But since m is a natural number, m ≥1 is automatic. But to be thorough, perhaps include it.\n\nAlternatively, in the example, the assumption was that n is an integer (so not necessarily natural) and n divisible by 7. Here, the problem states n and m are natural numbers with n ≥ m ≥1. So the minimal assumptions are:\n\nn and m are natural numbers,\nn ≥ m.\n\nBecause m being a natural number implies m ≥1, so m ≥1 is redundant. But the problem states \"n ≥ m ≥1\", so maybe the user wants to include m ≥1. To resolve this, perhaps check the example. In the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", and the assumption listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, the original problem says \"for every n ≥ m ≥1 natural numbers\", so the assumptions are n and m are natural numbers, and n ≥ m. Because m being a natural number already covers m ≥1. Therefore, the assumptions should be:\n\nn is a natural number,\nm is a natural number,\nn ≥ m.\n\nBut the problem statement includes \"n ≥ m ≥1\", which could be interpreted as both n ≥ m and m ≥1, but since m is a natural number, m ≥1 is redundant. However, to strictly follow the problem's phrasing, perhaps include all explicit conditions. The user's example included a redundant divisibility condition (n divisible by 7) in addition to n being an integer. Here, the problem's phrasing includes \"n ≥ m ≥1\", so perhaps we need to include m ≥1 as a separate assumption. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a natural number,\nm is a natural number,\nn ≥ m,\nm ≥ 1.\n\nBut since m is a natural number, m ≥1 is implied. However, to match the problem's wording exactly, it's better to list it. The example included both \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So if the problem states a condition explicitly, even if redundant, include it. Hence, the answer should list:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a natural number,\nm is a natural number,\nn ≥ m,\nm ≥ 1.\n\nBut perhaps the problem's original wording groups n and m together. For example, \"n and m are natural numbers with n ≥ m ≥1\". In that case, the assumptions could be:\n\nn and m are natural numbers,\nn ≥ m ≥ 1.\n\nBut the example split each condition into separate lines. So to adhere to the example's format, each individual condition should be on its own line. Hence:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a natural number,\nm is a natural number,\nn ≥ m,\nm ≥ 1.\n\nEven though m ≥1 is redundant, it's explicitly stated in the problem, so it's included. Now, the problem statement is to prove that (gcd(n,m)/n) * binomial(n,m) is an integer. That's the problem part.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a natural number,\nm is a natural number,\nn ≥ m,\nm ≥ 1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\frac{\\gcd(n,m)}{n} \\cdot \\binom{n}{m}$$ is an integer.\n\nThis seems to fit the required format. Each assumption is on its own line, and the problem is stated clearly. I think this is correct.",
