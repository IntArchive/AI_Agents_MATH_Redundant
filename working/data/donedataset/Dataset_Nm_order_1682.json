    "AcceptedAnswer": "Split into two cases: (i) $G/Z(G)\\cong C_2\\times C_2$ is Klein-$4$, and (ii) $Z(G)$ has index $\\ge6$. Since the quotient $G/Z(G)$ cannot be nontrivial cyclic, these two cases cover all bases. Let $Z=Z(G)$. $\\rm\\color{Blue}{(i)}$: Write $G=Z\\sqcup aZ\\sqcup bZ\\sqcup cZ$. Check $C_G(g)=Z\\cup aZ$ for $g\\in aZ$, and similarly for the other two cosets $bZ$ and $cZ$, while of course $C_G(g)=G$ if $g\\in Z$. Use $[\\Omega]$ for the Iverson bracket (i.e. $[\\Omega]=1$ if $\\Omega$ is true, and $[\\Omega]=0$ otherwise). Calculate $$P=\\frac{1}{|G\\times G|}\\sum_{a\\in G}\\sum_{b\\in G}[ab=ba]=\\frac{1}{|G|^2}\\sum_{a\\in G}|C_G(a)|=\\frac{1}{|G|^2}\\left(\\sum_{a\\in Z}|G|+\\sum_{a\\in G\\setminus Z}\\frac{|G|}{2}\\right)$$ $$=\\frac{1}{|G|^2}\\left(|Z||G|+|G\\setminus Z|\\frac{|G|}{2}\\right)=\\frac{1}{|G|^2}\\left(\\frac{|G|}{4}|G|+\\frac{3|G|}{4}\\frac{|G|}{2}\\right)=\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{3}{4}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{5}{8}.$$ $\\rm\\color{Blue}{(ii)}$: Start the same way as above, writing $$P=\\frac{1}{|G|^2}\\sum_{a\\in G}|C_G(a)|=\\frac{1}{|G|^2}\\left(\\sum_{a\\in Z}|G|+\\sum_{a\\in G\\setminus Z}|C_G(a)|\\right).$$ Using $|Z|\\le|G|/6$ and $|C_G(a)|\\le|G|/2$, we obtain the upper bound $$P\\le\\frac{1}{|G|^2}\\left(|G||Z|+\\big(|G|-|Z|\\big)\\frac{|G|}{2}\\right)=\\frac{1}{|G|^2}\\left(\\frac{|G|^2}{2}+|Z|\\frac{|G|}{2}\\right)\\le\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{6}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{7}{12}.$$ Note $7/12<5/8$. Therefore, we have proven: Theorem . $P>\\frac{5}{8}$ iff $G$ is abelian, $P=\\frac{5}{8}$ iff $G/Z(G)$ is Klein-$4$, and $P\\le\\frac{7}{12}$ otherwise. There are a couple slick character-theoretic proofs on mathoverflow, as well as forcing probabilities for solvability, nilpotence and odd cardinality. Note the $5/8$ bound is true for compact topological groups , where we pick $(a,b)\\in G\\times G$ according to the normalized Haar measure. One formula for the commuting probability $P$ that I didn't discuss above is as follows: $$P=\\frac{1}{|G|^2}\\sum_{a\\in G}|C_G(a)|=\\frac{1}{|G|}\\sum_{a\\in G}\\frac{1}{[G:C_G(a)]}=\\frac{1}{|G|}\\sum_{i=1}^k\\sum_{a\\in C_i}\\frac{1}{|C_i|}=\\frac{1}{|G|}\\sum_{i=1}^k\\frac{|C_i|}{|C_i|}=\\frac{k}{|G|},$$ where $C_1,\\cdots,C_k$ are the conjugacy classes of $G$ and $k$ is the number of conjugacy classes.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's take a look at this problem from Math Stack Exchange. The original question is about proving that a finite group G is abelian if the probability that two randomly chosen elements commute is greater than 5/8. \n\nFirst, I need to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants the assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object. Then, the problem statement itself.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the key was to extract each assumption individually. In the original problem here, the assumptions are about the group G. Let me parse through the question again:\n\n\"Suppose that G is a finite group. If P(ab=ba) >5/8, prove G is abelian.\"\n\nSo the assumptions here are:\n1. G is a finite group.\n2. The probability P(ab=ba) that two randomly chosen elements a and b commute is greater than 5/8.\n\nEach of these should be separate lines in the assumption section. The problem then is to prove that G is abelian under these conditions.\n\nWait, the example had assumptions that were properties applied to one object each. Here, the first assumption is about G being a finite group, which is a single property. The second assumption is about the probability being greater than 5/8. Both are applied to G, but each is a separate condition. So, in the assumption section, it should be two separate points.\n\nThe problem statement is then to prove G is abelian. Let me check if there are any other implicit assumptions. The problem mentions \"a,b ∈ G\" commute with probability >5/8, but in the formatted problem, the user wants assumptions listed as per the example. The example didn't include variables like a and b in the assumptions, just the main conditions on the objects involved (like n being an integer). Here, since a and b are elements of G, but the probability is a property of G itself, so the main assumptions are on G.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a finite group,\nThe probability that two randomly chosen elements of G commute is greater than 5/8.\n\nProblem:\nProve that G is abelian.\n\nYes, that seems right. Each assumption is a separate condition on G. The problem is to show G is abelian under those conditions. I don't see any other hidden assumptions here. The original problem doesn't mention anything else, so this should be accurate.",
