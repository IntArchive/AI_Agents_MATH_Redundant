    "Content": "Today's problem originates in this conversation with Willie Wong about the Fourier transform of a Gaussian function $$g_{\\sigma}(x)=e^{-\\sigma \\lvert x \\rvert^2},\\quad x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n;$$ where $\\sigma$ is a complex parameter. When $\\Re (\\sigma) \\ge 0$, $g_\\sigma$ is a tempered distribution$^{[1]}$ and so it is Fourier transformable. On the contrary, it appears obvious that if $\\Re(\\sigma) <0$ then $g_\\sigma$ is not tempered. Question 1 . What is the fastest way to prove this? My guess is that one should exploit the fact that the pairing \n$$\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} g_\\sigma(x)\\varphi(x)\\, dx$$ \nmakes no sense for some $\\varphi \\in \\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R}^n)$. But is it enough? I am afraid that this argument is incomplete. Question 2 . More generally, is there some characterization of tempered functions , that is, functions which belong to the space $L^1_{\\text{loc}}(\\mathbb{R})\\cap \\mathcal{S}'(\\mathbb{R})$? The only tempered functions that I know are polynomially growing functions . By this I mean the functions of the form $Pu$, where $P$ is a polynomial and $u \\in L^p(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ for some $p\\in[1, \\infty]$. Question 3 . Is it true that all tempered functions are polynomially  growing functions? $^{[1]}$ The definition of tempered distribution I refer to is the following. A distribution $T \\in \\mathcal{D}'(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ is called tempered if for every sequence $\\varphi_n \\in \\mathcal{D}(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ such that $\\varphi_n \\to 0$ in the Schwartz class sense, it happens that $\\langle T, \\varphi_n \\rangle \\to 0$. If this is the case then $T$ uniquely extends to a continuous linear functional on $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ and we write $T \\in \\mathcal{S}'(\\mathbb{R}^n)$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Question 1 What you have is almost enough. Assume $\\Re\\sigma \\leq -\\epsilon < 0$. Test $\\exp (-\\sigma |x|^2)$ \"against\" $\\phi(x) = \\exp( (\\sigma+\\epsilon/2)|x|^2)$ in the following way: you can construct a sequence of annular cut-off functions $\\chi_k$ such that $\\chi_k \\phi \\to 0$ in $\\mathcal{S}$ (using the exponential decay of $\\phi$) and $\\langle g_\\sigma, \\chi_k\\phi\\rangle > c > 0$ for all $k$. Question 2 You have the structure theorem of tempered distributions. (See Theorem 8.3.1 in Friedlander and Joshi). Theorem Every tempered distribution is a (distributional) derivative of finite order of some continuous function of polynomial growth. If you intersect against $L^1_{loc}$, this just guarantees that the distributional derivative is actually the weak derivative. From this you can conclude that an appropriate version of what you stated is true.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question has three parts, so I need to break them down into individual problems with their own assumptions.\n\nFirst, looking at Question 1: The user wants to prove that if the real part of σ is negative, then g_σ is not a tempered distribution. The assumptions here are that g_σ(x) = e^{-σ|x|²} where σ is complex, and the requirement is when Re(σ) < 0. The problem is to show it's not tempered. So the assumption would be Re(σ) < 0, applied to σ.\n\nFor Question 2: The user is asking for a characterization of tempered functions, which are locally integrable and tempered distributions. The assumptions here are that the functions are in L^1_loc ∩ S', and the problem is to characterize them.\n\nQuestion 3: Asks if all tempered functions are polynomially growing. The assumption is that a tempered function is in L^1_loc ∩ S', and the problem is to determine if they must be polynomially growing.\n\nI need to list each assumption per line, addressing one property per object. For each question, separate the assumptions and the problem. The example given had multiple problems, each with their own assumptions. So I should structure each of the three questions as separate problems with their own assumptions.\n\nLet me check the original problem again. The user defines tempered distributions and mentions that for Re(σ) ≥ 0, g_σ is tempered. The first question is about Re(σ) < 0. So the assumption for Question 1 is Re(σ) < 0. The problem is to prove g_σ is not tempered.\n\nFor Question 2, the user is looking for a characterization of tempered functions (which are functions that are both locally integrable and tempered distributions). The assumption here would be that the function is in L^1_loc ∩ S', and the problem is to characterize such functions.\n\nQuestion 3 asks if all tempered functions are polynomially growing, so the assumption is the same as in Question 2, and the problem is whether they must be polynomially growing.\n\nI need to ensure each assumption is a single line, one property per object. Let me structure each question with its assumptions and problem statement. The original problem has three distinct questions, each needing their own formatted section.",
