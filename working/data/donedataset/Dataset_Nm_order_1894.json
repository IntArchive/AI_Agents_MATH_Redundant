    "AcceptedAnswer": "There are two parts to the story here. Detailed arguments and variants can be found in Pólya-Szegő, Problems and theorems in analysis, Volume I: Series, integral calculus, theory of functions , page 198 and 199 (Exercises 98 and 99 of part I) Suppose that the sequence $(x_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ of real numbers is subadditive: $x_{m+n} \\leq x_m + x_n$. Consider $L =  \\inf\\limits_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\frac{x_n}{n}$. Either $L = - \\infty$ and $\\dfrac{a_n}{n}$ diverges properly to $-\\infty$, or  $$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{x_n}{n} =  \\inf_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\frac{x_n}{n} = L,$$ and in particular the limit exists. Let $L = \\inf\\limits_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\frac{x_n}{n}$. The case $L = - \\infty$ is easy, so assume $L \\gt -\\infty$. For $\\varepsilon \\gt 0$ there is an $m$ such that $\\frac{x_m}{m} \\lt L + \\varepsilon$. Writing $n = km + r$ with $0 \\leq r \\lt m$ we get\n$$L \\leq \\frac{x_{n}}{n} \\leq \\frac{k \\cdot x_m + x_r}{km+r} \\leq \\frac{x_m}{m}+ \\frac{x_r}{n} \\leq \\frac{x_m}{m} + \\frac{C}{n}$$\nwith $C = \\max{\\{x_0,\\ldots,x_{m-1}\\}}.$ For $n \\geq C/\\varepsilon$ we thus have $\\displaystyle L \\leq \\frac{x_n}{n} \\leq \\frac{x_m}{m} + \\varepsilon \\leq L+2\\varepsilon$ and thus the limit exists and equals the infimum of the sequence. The second part is: Suppose the sequence $(a_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ satisfies $-1 + a_m + a_n \\leq a_{m+n} \\leq 1 + a_m + a_n$. Then the limit $L = \\lim\\limits_{n \\to \\infty}\\frac{a_{n}}{n}$ exists and $L-1 \\leq \\frac{a_{n}}{n} \\leq L+1$. Note that the sequence $b_n = 1+a_n$ is subadditive: $b_{m+n} \\leq b_m + b_n$ hence we can apply the first part to it and find that \n$$-\\infty \\leq L =  \\inf_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\frac{1+a_{n}}{n} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1+a_{n}}{n} \\lt \\infty.$$\nSimilarly, $c_n = 1-a_n$ is subadditive and hence\n$$- \\infty \\leq -L = \\inf_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\frac{1-a_n}{n} = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{1-a_n}{n} \\lt \\infty.$$\nTherefore $L$ is a real number and $L \\leq \\dfrac{1+a_n}{n}$ together with $-L \\leq \\dfrac{1-a_n}{n}$ yields the desired estimates $nL - 1 \\leq a_n \\leq nL+1$ where $L = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{a_n}{n}$ also follollows from the above. These lemmas have many applications. An easy variant of this is that a submultiplicative sequence of non-negative numbers, that is $a_{n+m} \\leq a_n a_m$ has the property that $a_{n}^{1/n}$ converges. This can be used for the spectral radius formula in functional analysis. Recently, quasi-subadditive sequences have received quite a bit of attention in guise of quasi-morphisms with significant applications in group theory, dynamical systems, symplectic geometry, and so on. A beautiful elementary application is Norbert A'Campo's model of real numbers via almost additive maps $\\varphi: \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ (he calls them slopes), that is functions $\\varphi$ satisfying $$\\sup\\limits_{m,n \\in \\mathbb{Z}}{|\\varphi(m+n) - \\varphi(m) - \\varphi(n)|} \\lt \\infty$$ modulo a simple equivalence relation.\nThe basic idea here is that any real number $r$ yields such a map by setting $\\phi(n) = \\lfloor rn \\rfloor$. The paper is highly recommended, as it contains quite a few ingenious constructions and interesting historical remarks.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe original problem is about proving that a sequence $a_n$ lives in the interval $(nL - 1, nL + 1)$ after showing that the sequence $a_n/n$ converges to a limit $L$. The user mentions they already proved convergence and that $a_n$ lies in $(nL - 2, nL + 2)$ but can't tighten it to the desired interval.\n\nLooking at the given example, assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. The problem statement is then clearly stated.\n\nIn the question, the key assumptions are the inequalities for the sequence $a_n$: for any n, m, $a_n + a_m - 1 < a_{n+m} < a_n + a_m + 1$. Also, it's given that the sequence $a_n/n$ converges to L, which is part of the problem to prove first, but the user already did that. The main problem now is to show $a_n$ is in $(nL -1, nL +1)$.\n\nWait, but the user mentions they proved convergence and that $a_n$ is in $(nL -2, nL +2)$. So the problem here is to improve that interval. The original problem as stated in the question includes two parts: first proving convergence of $a_n/n$ to L, then proving $a_n$ lies in that interval. But the user already proved everything except the tighter bound. So the problem to structure should be the second part, given that convergence is already established.\n\nSo the assumptions should include the subadditive-like inequality for the sequence, and any other given conditions. The problem is to prove the specific interval.\n\nLet me list the assumptions:\n\n1. For any positive integers n and m, the sequence satisfies $a_n + a_m - 1 < a_{n+m} < a_n + a_m + 1$.\n2. The sequence $a_n / n$ converges to a limit L.\n\nWait, but does the problem statement assume convergence or is that part of what needs to be proved? The original problem says \"Prove that the sequence $a_n / n$ converges (to L) and then prove that $a_n \\in (nL -1, nL +1)$\". So the user has already done both parts but with a weaker interval. However, when structuring the problem, we need to present the problem as intended, not the user's progress. But the user is asking for help with the second part, so maybe the problem statement is just the second part? Wait, the user says \"Prove that the sequence $a_n / n$ converges (to L) and then prove that...\" So the problem has two parts. But the user already proved convergence and the interval $(nL -2, nL +2)$, but can't get to the tighter interval. However, when structuring the problem, we need to present the original problem as stated, not the user's attempt. So the original problem is to prove convergence and then the interval. But in the formatted example, the assumption included the divisibility by 7, which was part of the problem's given conditions. So in this case, the problem's given conditions are the inequality for all n, m, and the problem is to prove convergence and the interval. But the user is focusing on the interval part, having already done convergence and a weaker interval. But to structure the problem as per the original, we need to include all parts. Wait, the user's question starts by stating they want to prove the sequence lives in a specific interval, and they have proved it lives in a bigger one. So the problem is: given the inequality for a_n, prove that a_n/n converges to L and then that a_n is in (nL -1, nL +1). But since the user is stuck on the second part, maybe the problem as presented is the second part, given that convergence is already established. But in the original problem, both parts are required. However, when structuring, we need to present the problem as originally stated by the user. The user's original problem is to prove convergence and then the interval. So in the formatted problem, the assumptions should include the given inequality, and the problem is to prove both parts. However, the user has already proved convergence and the weaker interval, but the problem as stated in the question is to prove the tighter interval. Wait, the problem as stated in the user's question is: \"Prove that the sequence $a_n /n$ converges (to L) and then prove that $a_n \\in (nL -1, nL +1)$\". So the full problem includes both parts. But the user says they proved everything but the tighter interval. However, in the problem formatting, we need to present the problem as given, not the user's progress. Therefore, the formatted problem should list the assumption about the sequence's inequality and then the problem statement to prove both convergence and the interval. However, looking back at the example, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for all integers n. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, the assumption included \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91\". But in the formatted problem, the assumption is that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Because the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7; it's for every integer n. So perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user wants me to follow that structure. Wait, the user provided that example. Maybe there's a mistake in the example. Let me check again. Original problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. Formatted problem: assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91. Wait, this seems wrong because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That changes the problem. Maybe that was an error in the example. But the user provided that example, so perhaps in their format, the assumptions are all the given conditions, even if they are universal quantifiers. Wait, but in the original problem, the only assumption is that n is an integer, which is given by \"for every integer n\". So perhaps in the example, the user mistakenly added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which is not part of the original problem. That might be an error. Therefore, the example might be incorrect, but I need to follow the user's instructions. Wait, the user wants me to structure the problem as per the format, following the example they provided. So in their example, they listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, even though the original problem was for every integer n. That suggests that perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user wants me to follow it. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a typo, and the user intended to have n divisible by 7. But regardless, given the user's example, they are listing all the assumptions in the problem, including the universal conditions. So in the current problem, the assumptions would be the given inequality for the sequence a_n for any n and m. So the first assumption is that for any positive integers n and m, the sequence satisfies the inequality a_n + a_m -1 < a_{n+m} < a_n + a_m +1. Then the problem is to prove that a_n/n converges to L and that a_n lies in (nL -1, nL +1). However, the user's example split the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property. So for the current problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- For any positive integers n and m, the sequence satisfies a_n + a_m -1 < a_{n+m} < a_n + a_m +1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the sequence a_n /n converges to a limit L and that a_n ∈ (nL -1, nL +1).\n\nBut in the user's question, they mention that they already proved the convergence and the weaker interval. So maybe the problem is split into two parts. But according to the original problem statement, it's both parts. However, the user is stuck on the second part. But when structuring, we need to present the entire problem as originally stated. So the problem includes both proving convergence and the interval. However, the user's example included an incorrect assumption (divisible by 7), but perhaps in their format, they expect to list all given conditions as assumptions, even if they are universal. So in this case, the assumption is the inequality condition on the sequence for all n, m. Then the problem is to prove convergence and the interval. Therefore, formatted as:\n\nAssumption:\nFor any positive integers n and m, the sequence a_n satisfies a_n + a_m -1 < a_{n+m} < a_n + a_m +1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the sequence a_n /n converges to a limit L and that a_n ∈ (nL -1, nL +1).\n\nBut the user's example split the assumptions into lines. Wait, in the example, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. That seems like a mistake, but following that, in the current problem, the only assumption is the inequality for any n, m. So that's one assumption. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nFor any positive integers n and m, the sequence a_n satisfies a_n + a_m -1 < a_{n+m} < a_n + a_m +1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the sequence a_n /n converges to a limit L and that a_n ∈ (nL -1, nL +1).\n\nBut the user's example had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, there's only one assumption. So the formatted problem should list each assumption on a separate line. In this case, the single assumption is the inequality for all n, m. So it's one line. If there were more conditions, each would be a separate line. Therefore, the formatted problem is correct as above.",
