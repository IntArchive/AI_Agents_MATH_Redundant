    "Content": "Prove that the number of ways to represent a natural number $n$ as the sum of three different natural numbers is equal to $$\\left[\\frac{n^2-6n+12}{12}\\right].$$ It was in our meeting a year ago, but I forgot, how I proved it. Let the needed number be $a_n$ , where $n\\geq6$ and let $b_n$ be number of ways to represent a natural number $n$ as the sum of two different natural numbers. Thus, $a_n=b_{n-3}+b_{n-6}+...$ because we can go from $(a,b)$ , where $a<b$ , to $(1,a+1,b+1)$ , $(2,a+2,b+2)$ ... Thank you for your help!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If $n=r+s+t$ is a representation of a positive integer as a sum of integers which $r>s>t>0$ , then $n-6=(r-3)+(s-2)+(t-1)$ is a representation of $n-6$ as a sum of integers $(r-3)\n\\ge(s-2)\\ge(t-1)\\ge0$ , that is a partition of $n-6$ into at most three parts.\nTherefore $a_n=c_{n-6}$ where $c_n$ is the number of partitions of $n$ into at most three\nparts. By conjugation of partitions, $c_n$ is the number of partitions of $n$ into parts\nof size at most $3$ . So the generating function of the $c_n$ is $$C(x)=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty c_nx^n=\\frac1{(1-x)(1-x^2)(1-x^3)}.$$ Now use the normal manoeuvres with rational functions to find the $n$ -th term:\nwrite in partial fractions $$C(x)=\\frac{A}{1-x}+\\frac{B}{(1-x)^2}+\\frac{C}{(1-x)^3}+\n\\frac{D}{1+x}+\\frac{E+Fx}{1+x+x^2}$$ and go from there.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example provided helps, so I should follow that closely.\n\nFirst, the original problem is about proving that the number of ways to represent a natural number n as the sum of three different natural numbers is equal to the floor of (n² - 6n + 12)/12. The user mentioned that n is ≥6 and introduced a_n as the number of ways, and b_n as the number of ways for two numbers. They also mentioned a recursive relation involving b_{n-3} + b_{n-6} + ..., which might be part of the problem's context but not the assumptions per se.\n\nSo, according to the example, the assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. The problem statement here specifies that n is a natural number, and n ≥6. Also, the representations are as sums of three different natural numbers. The original problem's question is to prove the formula for a_n.\n\nThe example structured the assumptions by listing the properties line by line. Here, the key assumptions are:\n\n1. n is a natural number.\n2. n is greater than or equal to 6.\n3. The number of ways is counted as the sum of three different natural numbers.\n\nBut wait, the original problem statement says \"natural number as the sum of three different natural numbers.\" So \"different\" is important here. So each of the three numbers must be distinct. Therefore, another assumption is that the three natural numbers are distinct.\n\nSo, breaking down the assumptions:\n\n- n is a natural number.\n- n ≥ 6.\n- The three natural numbers in the sum are distinct.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were listed each on a separate line, addressing one property per line. So each of these points is a separate assumption.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a natural number,\nn is greater than or equal to 6,\nthe sum consists of three different natural numbers.\n\nProblem: Prove that the number of ways to represent n as such a sum is equal to ⎣(n² -6n +12)/12⎦.\n\nBut wait, the original problem's title mentions \"three different natural numbers,\" which implies that order doesn't matter? Because in partitions, order typically doesn't matter. So the problem is about unordered triples of distinct natural numbers adding up to n. So that's an important condition. So maybe the assumptions should also state that the order does not matter (i.e., it's a combination, not permutation). But the problem as stated by the user might not specify that. Wait, the user's problem statement says \"the number of ways to represent a natural number as the sum of three different natural numbers.\" In additive number theory, usually, \"ways\" can vary based on ordering or not. But if they use \"different natural numbers,\" that might imply that the numbers are distinct, but the order doesn't matter. Because if order mattered, then it would be permutations. However, the formula given is the floor function, which suggests that it's counting unordered triples. For example, for n=6, the only way is 1+2+3, which gives a_n=1. Plugging into the formula: (36 -36 +12)/12 =12/12=1, floor is 1. That works. If order mattered, there would be 6 permutations, but the formula gives 1, so it's unordered.\n\nTherefore, the assumption should include that the order does not matter. But the original problem doesn't explicitly state whether order matters. Wait, the user's problem says \"the number of ways to represent a natural number n as the sum of three different natural numbers.\" In standard combinatorics, unless specified otherwise, \"ways\" here would refer to unordered representations. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- n is a natural number.\n- n ≥ 6.\n- The representation is as the sum of three distinct natural numbers.\n- The order of the addends does not matter.\n\nBut maybe the original problem doesn't mention order, so maybe that's an implicit assumption. However, the example given in the problem by the user (the A(n) problem) only had assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. So perhaps here, the key explicit assumptions from the problem are n is natural and n ≥6. The rest is part of the problem statement.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" So we need to extract the assumptions from the problem. The problem says \"the number of ways to represent a natural number n as the sum of three different natural numbers\" and \"n ≥6\". So the assumptions are:\n\n1. n is a natural number.\n2. n ≥6.\n3. The three numbers in the sum are different natural numbers.\n\nBut the user's example only listed two assumptions for the problem: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But the original problem in the example had \"for every integer n\", but then in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as another assumption. Wait, that example seems to have modified the problem. Wait, no, looking back: the original problem in the example was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check.\n\nOriginal problem in the example: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\"\n\nFormatted problem's assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut that seems like the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, that's contradictory. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe the example is wrong? Or perhaps the example was a mistake. Because if the original problem is for every integer n, then the assumptions shouldn't include divisibility by 7 unless the user made a mistake. Wait, maybe the example was a bad example. Because in reality, 91=13*7, so maybe the original problem requires n to be divisible by both 7 and something else? But in the example, the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", but the original didn't have that. So maybe the example is incorrect. Hmm, that complicates things.\n\nBut according to the user's instruction, the example is how they want the problem structured, even if the example itself might have errors. So in the example, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, making the problem statement now to prove divisibility by 91 under that assumption. So perhaps the user intended that the formatted problem includes all necessary assumptions, even if they're not in the original problem. Wait, that can't be. Maybe the example is correct but the original problem had a typo, and the user intended to have n divisible by 7. Otherwise, the example's formatting would be incorrect.\n\nBut regardless, the user wants us to follow the example's structure, which for the given problem, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property.\n\nBack to the current problem. The problem as stated by the user is:\n\nProve that the number of ways to represent a natural number n as the sum of three different natural numbers is equal to floor[(n² -6n +12)/12]. It was in our meeting a year ago, but I forgot, how I proved it. Let the needed number be a_n, where n ≥6 and let b_n be number of ways to represent a natural number n as the sum of two different natural numbers. Thus, a_n = b_{n-3} + b_{n-6} + ... because we can go from (a,b) where a < b, to (1, a+1, b+1), (2, a+2, b+2) ... Thank you for your help!\n\nSo the user mentions that n ≥6 and that a_n is defined for n ≥6. The problem is to prove the formula for a_n. So the key assumptions are:\n\n1. n is a natural number.\n2. n ≥6.\n3. The three numbers in the sum are distinct natural numbers.\n\nPossibly also that the order doesn't matter, but the original problem doesn't specify, but since the formula is a floor function, which usually counts unordered partitions, that's implied. However, the example didn't list implicit assumptions, only explicit ones. So in this case, the user's problem mentions \"three different natural numbers\", which is an explicit condition, so that should be an assumption. Also, n is a natural number and n ≥6, as given.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a natural number,\nn is greater than or equal to 6,\nthe three natural numbers in the sum are distinct.\n\nProblem: Prove that the number of ways to represent n as the sum of three different natural numbers is equal to ⎣(n² -6n +12)/12⎦.\n\nI think that's correct. The example included assumptions that weren't in the original problem (if the example's original problem was as stated), but perhaps the user made a mistake. Anyway, following the user's example, we should list the assumptions explicitly mentioned in the problem. The original problem here mentions n is a natural number, n ≥6, and three different natural numbers. So those are the assumptions.",
