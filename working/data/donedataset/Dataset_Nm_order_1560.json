    "Content": "For what manifolds $M$ is the suspension $\\Sigma M$ also a manifold? By the suspension of a topological space $X$ (not necessarily a manifold), I mean the space $$\\Sigma X = (X \\times [0,1])/{\\sim}$$ where $\\sim$ is the equivalence relation which glues $X \\times \\{0\\}$ to a point $p$ and $X \\times \\{1\\}$ to a point $q$. The topology is of course given by the quotient topology. If $M = S^n$ is a sphere, then it is easy to see that $\\Sigma M$ is homeomorphic to $S^{n+1}$, and hence a manifold. Claim: The only possibility is that $M$ is a sphere. I can prove this statement, but it relies on some pretty hefty results. So my question is the following: Is there an easier proof than the following? In particular, can we remove the use of the double suspension theorem or the $h$-cobordism theorem / Poincaré Conjecture? Proof: Suppose $M$ and $\\Sigma M$ are manifolds of dimensions $n$ and $n+1$ respectively. This is obviously true locally everywhere except at $p$ and $q$, so we need only consider that some neighbourhood of $p$ is homeomorphic to a disk (by symmetry, this implies the same result for $q$). Pick a neighbourhood $U = (M\\times [0,\\epsilon))/{\\sim}$ of $p$. By excision and since $\\Sigma M$ is a manifold, we have $$\\widetilde{H_*}(S^{n+1}) \\cong H_*(\\Sigma M, \\Sigma M \\setminus \\{p\\}) \\cong H_*(U,U \\setminus \\{p\\}).$$ Now, $U \\setminus \\{p\\} = M \\times (0,\\epsilon)$ deformation retracts to $M$, and so we can compute this by taking the LES for the pair $(U,M)$. Since $U$ is contractible, every third term of this sequence (except along the $0^{\\mathrm{th}}$ cohomology) is $0$, and we easily can conclude that $$H_{k+1}(\\Sigma M, \\Sigma M \\setminus \\{p\\}) \\cong H_k(M)$$ for $k > 0$. Therefore, $H_k(M) = H_{k+1}(S^{n+1})$ for $k > 0$. And we know $H_0$ is just $\\mathbb{Z}$ (since $H_n \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, Poincaré duality implies $H^0 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ and so there is only one component). In particular, this proves that $M$ is a homology sphere. That's all relatively standard, and all well and good. Here's the part that gets a little bit crazy. Since $M$ is a homology sphere, the double suspension theorem yields that $\\Sigma \\Sigma M$ is a sphere. So we need that $\\Sigma M$ suspends to a sphere. By this MO question , the answer of which appears to rely either on $h$-cobordism or the Poincaré Conjecture (choose your poison), it follows that $\\Sigma M$ is therefore a sphere, and applying this same reasoning to $\\Sigma M$, it follows that $M$ is a sphere.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You don't need the double suspension theorem, because $M$ is a homotopy sphere (hence, by the Poincaré conjecture, it is homeomorphic to the sphere). To prove that, it is enough to show that $M$ is simply-connected (assume that $\\dim M \\geq 2$ as otherwise there is nothing to prove). Then it follows from your computation of homology and the Whitehead theorem that a degree one map $M \\rightarrow S^n$ is a homotopy equivalence. The suspension $\\Sigma M$ is simply-connected by the van Kampen theorem, because it is a union of two contractible open cones over $M$, whose intersection $M \\times (-\\epsilon,\\epsilon)$ is connected. Since $\\Sigma M$ is a manifold of dimension at least $3$, removing a finite number of points from $\\Sigma M$ doesn't change its fundamental group (again, this is a consequence of the van Kampen theorem and the fact that $S^k$ is simply-connected for $k \\geq 2$). In particular, $\\Sigma M \\setminus \\{p,q\\} = M \\times (0,1)$ is simply-connected, and so is $M$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is asking about the suspension of a manifold M, specifically for which manifolds M the suspension ΣM is also a manifold. The example given is when M is a sphere, then ΣM is a sphere of one higher dimension. The claim is that the only such M are spheres, and the user wants a simpler proof without using heavy theorems like the double suspension theorem or h-cobordism/Poincaré conjecture.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem from the original question. Let's look at the original problem statement again. The user defines the suspension ΣX as (X × [0,1])/~ where X×{0} is glued to a point p and X×{1} to q. The topology is quotient. The problem is to determine for which M (manifolds) the suspension ΣM is a manifold. The claim is that only spheres work.\n\nThe user's proof uses that if ΣM is a manifold, then around points p and q, neighborhoods must be Euclidean disks. The homology computation shows M is a homology sphere. Then using double suspension theorem and other heavy results to conclude M is a sphere.\n\nBut the question is to structure the problem into assumptions and the problem itself. The example given in the format had assumptions listed line by line, each about one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nLooking at the problem here, the main assumptions are:\n\n1. M is a manifold.\n2. ΣM (the suspension of M) is a manifold.\n3. The dimension of M is n, and ΣM has dimension n+1.\n\nWait, in the proof, they mention \"Suppose M and ΣM are manifolds of dimensions n and n+1 respectively.\" So that's an assumption in their proof. So the problem is assuming that if M is a manifold, then ΣM is a manifold of dimension n+1, and the conclusion is that M must be a sphere.\n\nBut the original problem is \"For what manifolds M is the suspension ΣM also a manifold?\" So the question is general, but the claim is that only spheres satisfy this. So the user is presenting their proof and asking if there's a simpler way.\n\nBut for structuring the problem as per the format, we need to extract the assumptions. The problem as stated in the title is \"For what manifolds M is the suspension ΣM also a manifold?\" But the user's claim is that the only possibility is M is a sphere.\n\nSo the problem as presented in the question is the claim that M must be a sphere if ΣM is a manifold, under the assumptions that M is a manifold and ΣM is a manifold.\n\nWait, but in the user's proof, they start with \"Suppose M and ΣM are manifolds of dimensions n and n+1 respectively.\" So their proof is under the assumption that ΣM is a manifold, and then they conclude M is a sphere.\n\nTherefore, the problem to structure would be:\n\nAssumptions:\n- M is a manifold.\n- ΣM is a manifold.\n- The dimension of ΣM is n+1 when M has dimension n.\n\nProblem: Prove that M is a sphere.\n\nBut wait, the original problem is \"For what M is ΣM a manifold?\" So the answer is \"Only spheres\", but the user's proof is showing that if ΣM is a manifold, then M must be a sphere. So the problem is \"Prove that if M is a manifold and ΣM is a manifold of dimension n+1, then M is a sphere.\"\n\nBut in their assumptions, the user's proof uses that ΣM is a manifold (of dimension n+1) and M is a manifold (of dimension n). Therefore, the structured problem should list these assumptions.\n\nBut let's check the example given. The example had assumptions like \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\" and the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. So each assumption is a separate condition.\n\nIn this case, the problem is to determine for which M (manifolds) ΣM is a manifold, and the claim is that M must be a sphere. The assumptions for the problem would be the conditions under which the conclusion holds. The user's proof starts by assuming that M and ΣM are manifolds of respective dimensions n and n+1. So the key assumptions here are:\n\n1. M is a manifold of dimension n.\n2. The suspension ΣM is a manifold of dimension n+1.\n\nTherefore, the structured problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nM is a manifold,\nΣM is a manifold,\nThe dimension of ΣM is n+1 when M has dimension n.\n\nProblem: Prove that M is a sphere.\n\nWait, but the original question is \"For what manifolds M is the suspension ΣM also a manifold?\" So the answer is M must be a sphere, but the user's claim is that. So the problem is to prove that if M is a manifold and ΣM is a manifold (of dimension n+1), then M is a sphere.\n\nBut the example given in the format included specific assumptions. Let me check again. The example's original problem was about proving A(n) divisible by 91, with assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But in the user's problem here, the assumptions are that M is a manifold, ΣM is a manifold, and their dimensions are n and n+1. However, the dimension part might be implicit because suspension of an n-manifold should be (n+1)-dimensional, but perhaps needs to be stated as an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the dimension is a result rather than an assumption. Wait, the suspension of an n-dimensional space is (n+1)-dimensional. So if ΣM is a manifold, then it must be (n+1)-dimensional. So maybe the only assumptions needed are M is a manifold and ΣM is a manifold. But in the user's proof, they explicitly suppose M and ΣM are manifolds of dimensions n and n+1. So perhaps that's part of the problem's setup.\n\nTherefore, structured as:\n\nAssumption:\nM is a manifold,\nΣM is a manifold,\ndim(ΣM) = dim(M) + 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that M is a sphere.\n\nBut maybe the third assumption is redundant because suspension of an n-dimensional space is (n+1)-dimensional. So perhaps the problem is:\n\nAssumption:\nM is a manifold,\nΣM is a manifold.\n\nProblem: Prove that M is a sphere.\n\nBut the user's proof mentions dimensions, so maybe it's important to include the dimension assumption. However, suspension inherently increases dimension by 1. So if M is a manifold of dimension n, then ΣM, if a manifold, must be n+1. So maybe that's a given, not an assumption. Hence, perhaps the assumptions are just M is a manifold and ΣM is a manifold. Then the problem is to show M is a sphere.\n\nBut the user's proof starts with \"Suppose M and ΣM are manifolds of dimensions n and n+1 respectively.\" So in their proof, they are assuming the dimensions, but perhaps the problem is structured as:\n\nAssumption:\nM is a manifold,\nΣM is a manifold.\n\nProblem: Prove that M is a sphere.\n\nBut to make sure, maybe the dimension relationship is important. Let's check the example again. In the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, but the formatted problem included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So in this case, the user's original problem may have had a wider scope (for every integer n), but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no: the original problem was \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem in the example included an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7, perhaps as a mistake? Wait, no. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal problem in the example: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem's assumptions were n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. So that seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example was a mistake. Because if the original problem was for every integer n, then the formatted problem's assumptions should not include divisibility by 7 unless there was a misunderstanding.\n\nBut assuming the example is correct, perhaps the user intended to filter out some conditions. Anyway, in this current problem, we need to extract the assumptions from the user's problem statement.\n\nThe user's problem is: \"For what manifolds M is the suspension ΣM also a manifold? Claim: The only possibility is that M is a sphere.\"\n\nSo the problem is to prove that if M is a manifold and ΣM is a manifold, then M is a sphere.\n\nBut the user's proof starts by assuming M and ΣM are manifolds of dimensions n and n+1. So maybe the correct assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nM is a manifold,\nΣM is a manifold,\ndim(ΣM) = dim(M) + 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that M is a sphere.\n\nBut actually, the suspension of an n-dimensional space is (n+1)-dimensional, so if ΣM is a manifold, it's automatically of dimension n+1. Therefore, the third assumption may not be needed. Hence, the correct assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nM is a manifold,\nΣM is a manifold.\n\nProblem: Prove that M is a sphere.\n\nBut in the user's proof, they mention \"Suppose M and ΣM are manifolds of dimensions n and n+1 respectively.\" So they are explicitly stating the dimension relationship. But if the dimension is inherent to the suspension, then maybe it's redundant. So perhaps the answer is:\n\nAssumption:\nM is a manifold,\nΣM is a manifold.\n\nProblem: Prove that M is a sphere.\n\nBut let's check the example again. The example had an original problem where the assumption was \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like an error, but maybe the user made a mistake. In any case, for the current problem, we need to list the assumptions as per the problem's requirements.\n\nThe problem is to determine for which M (manifolds) ΣM is a manifold, and the answer is only spheres. Therefore, the problem is to show that if M is a manifold and ΣM is a manifold, then M must be a sphere. So the assumptions are:\n\n1. M is a manifold.\n2. ΣM is a manifold.\n\nProblem: Prove that M is a sphere.\n\nBut in the user's proof, they also use the dimension condition. However, since suspension of an n-manifold would naturally be n+1-dimensional, and if ΣM is a manifold, it must have that dimension. So maybe the dimension is a consequence, not an assumption. Therefore, the structured problem should be as above.\n\nBut let's check if the dimension is part of the problem. The user's proof starts with \"Suppose M and ΣM are manifolds of dimensions n and n+1 respectively.\" So maybe the problem is under the assumption that ΣM is a manifold of dimension n+1, given M is a manifold of dimension n. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- M is a manifold of dimension n.\n- ΣM is a manifold of dimension n+1.\n\nProblem: Prove that M is a sphere.\n\nSo combining these, the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nM is a manifold,\nΣM is a manifold,\nThe dimension of ΣM is n+1 when M has dimension n.\n\nBut since the dimension of ΣM is determined by M's dimension, perhaps it's redundant. However, to be precise, maybe we need to include it.\n\nAlternatively, since the suspension of a space X has dimension dim(X) + 1, then if M is a manifold of dimension n, then ΣM has dimension n+1 by definition. Therefore, if ΣM is a manifold, it must be of dimension n+1. So the assumption that ΣM is a manifold (of dimension n+1) is sufficient.\n\nHence, the structured problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nM is a manifold,\nΣM is a manifold.\n\nProblem: Prove that M is a sphere.\n\nBut the user's proof uses homology calculations and heavy theorems. The problem is to prove that under these assumptions, M is a sphere. Therefore, the answer should list the assumptions as M being a manifold and ΣM being a manifold, then the problem is to prove M is a sphere.",
