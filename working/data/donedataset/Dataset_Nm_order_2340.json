    "Content": "Let $f(x)$ be a continuous function in $\\mathbb R$ that for all $x\\in(-\\infty,+\\infty)$, satisfies\n$$ \\lim_{h\\rightarrow+\\infty}{[f(x+h)-2f(x)+f(x-h)]}=0. $$ Prove that $f(x)=ax+b$ for some $a,b\\in\\mathbb R$. This is a problem from my exercise book, but I can't figure out the solution of it, I think the solution in my book is wrong. :( Any idea and proof of it are welcome! Thank you in advance.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "We can assume that $f(-1)=0$ and $f(1)=0$ (because if not then replace $f(x)$ by $f(x)-\\frac{f(1)-f(-1)}{2}(x+1) -f(-1)$). We prove that $f=0$, hence for general $f$ we will have $f(x) = \\frac{f(1)-f(-1)}{2}(x+1) -f(-1)$. The hypothesis for $x=1$ and $x=-1$ gives :\n$$f(h)=-f(2-h)+o(1),$$\n$$f(h)=-f(-2-h)=o(1),$$\nwhen $h$ goes to $+\\infty$. Lemma : $f$ is periodic. Proof. Take $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Then :\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\nf(x+h)+f(x-h)\n&=& 2 f(x) + o(1) \\\\\n&=& -f(2-x-h) - f(2-x+h) + o(1) = -2f(2-x) +o(1) \\\\\n&=& -f(2-x-h) - f(-2-x+h) + o(1) = -2f(-x) +o(1) \\\\\n&=& -f(-2-x-h) - f(-2-x+h) + o(1) = -2f(-2-x) +o(1) \\\\\n\\end{eqnarray*}\nHence $f(x)=-f(-x)=-f(2-x)=-f(-2-x)$. This implies that $f$ is $2$-periodic. QED Let $T$ be the group of periods of $f$ and $t \\in T$. Then\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\forall x, \\ f(x+h)+f(x-h)\n&=& 2 f(x) + o(1) \\\\\n&=& f(x+h)+f(t+x-h) = 2 f(t/2+x) +o(1) \\\\\n\\end{eqnarray*}\nHence $\\frac{t}{2} \\in T$. So $T$ is non discrete and since $f$ is continuous, $T=\\mathbb{R}$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified Assumption and Problem sections.\n\nFirst, I need to read the original problem carefully. The question is about proving that a continuous function f(x) must be of the form ax + b given a certain limit condition. The original problem states that f is continuous on the real numbers and that the limit as h approaches infinity of [f(x+h) - 2f(x) + f(x-h)] equals zero for all x. The user also mentions that the problem is from an exercise book and they're skeptical about the solution provided there.\n\nNow, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem mentions that f is continuous on ℝ, so that's one assumption. Then, the limit condition applies to all x in (-∞, +∞). The limit itself is as h approaches positive infinity of the expression f(x+h) - 2f(x) + f(x-h) equals zero. Each assumption should be listed line by line, addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nWait, the original problem didn't mention any restrictions on a and b other than being real numbers, so the conclusion is that f must be a linear function. The assumptions here are the continuity of f and the limit condition holding for all real x.\n\nSo, structuring this:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) is a continuous function on ℝ,\nFor all x ∈ ℝ, lim_{h→+∞} [f(x+h) - 2f(x) + f(x-h)] = 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f(x) = ax + b for some a, b ∈ ℝ.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is on its own line. The first assumption is continuity, the second is the limit condition. The problem is to show f is linear. That should fit the format. The example provided in the original query had two assumptions, one about n being an integer and another about divisibility by 7. Here, similarly, two assumptions: continuity and the limit condition. The problem statement is straightforward. I think that's all. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem's title was \"Prove f(x)=ax+b\", and the question body gives the conditions. Yes, the assumptions are correct. The problem is to prove the function is linear. So the formatted version should look like that. I don't see any other hidden assumptions. The user didn't mention any other conditions, so this should be accurate.",
