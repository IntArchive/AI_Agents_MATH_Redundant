    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example they provided shows that assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. The original problem is to prove that sqrt(2) + cube root(3) is irrational.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the question correctly. The user mentioned \"Process to show that √2 + ∛3 is irrational.\" The task is to format this into assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nNow, looking at the example, assumptions were about the integer n and divisibility by 7. For the current problem, the main objects are sqrt(2) and cube root(3). What assumptions are inherent here?\n\nWell, sqrt(2) is known to be irrational, and cube root(3) is also irrational. But the problem is about their sum. However, the example didn't include known properties as assumptions. The original example had assumptions that were part of the problem statement. Wait, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, and \"n is divisible by 7\" which was not in the original. Wait, wait, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted example added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that might be a mistake. Wait no, looking back: the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem's assumption says \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems conflicting. Maybe the example was incorrect? Or perhaps the user had a different intention. Hmm.\n\nWait, the example given by the user shows that the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem lists assumptions as n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like an error because the original problem didn't restrict n to being divisible by 7. So perhaps the example had a mistake. But maybe the user intended that the problem in the example was actually with an added assumption? Or maybe the example was incorrect. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in their example. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That would change the problem. So maybe the example is wrong. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instruction based on their example. So perhaps in their example, they included both the general assumption (n is integer) and an additional condition (divisible by 7). Wait, but the problem in the example says \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" under the assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But the original problem didn't have that condition. So maybe there was a mistake. But the user provided that example, so I have to follow the structure they showed.\n\nTherefore, for the current problem: \"Prove that sqrt(2) + cube_root(3) is irrational\", the assumptions would be the properties of the numbers involved. But the problem itself doesn't state any conditions; it's just about proving the sum is irrational. However, in the example, the assumptions included conditions on n. So perhaps for this problem, the only assumption is that sqrt(2) and cube_root(3) are real numbers? But that's trivial. Or maybe the problem doesn't have any assumptions beyond the numbers being as they are. Wait, in the example, the assumption listed n is an integer, which was part of the original problem's universal quantifier. So perhaps for the current problem, the assumptions would be that sqrt(2) is a real number, cube_root(3) is a real number, etc., but that's too trivial. Alternatively, maybe there are no specific assumptions beyond the definitions. But the example included an assumption that was part of the problem's premise.\n\nWait, the original problem in the example said \"for every integer n\", so the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. Then the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 under that assumption. But in the example's formatted problem, there was an additional assumption \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original. That seems like a mistake. Therefore, perhaps the user's example was incorrect, but we need to proceed as per their instruction.\n\nSo for the current problem: \"Prove that sqrt(2) + cube_root(3) is irrational\", the assumptions would be the properties needed for the proof. But the problem as stated doesn't have any explicit conditions. The numbers sqrt(2) and cube_root(3) are real numbers, irrational. But maybe the problem assumes that sqrt(2) is irrational and cube_root(3) is irrational, but the sum of two irrationals can be rational or irrational, so the problem is to show that in this case, their sum is irrational. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions are that sqrt(2) is irrational, cube_root(3) is irrational, but those are known facts. However, in the example, the assumptions were part of the problem's given conditions. Since the current problem doesn't state any conditions, maybe there are no assumptions to list. But the example included an assumption even when the original problem was a universal statement. Wait, in the example, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So for our current problem, perhaps the assumptions are that sqrt(2) and cube_root(3) are real numbers, but that's too basic. Alternatively, maybe there are no assumptions, but the user's format requires listing assumptions. Wait, in the example, they split the original problem's universal quantifier into an assumption. So for our problem, since there are no quantifiers or conditions, maybe the assumptions are none, but the format requires listing something. But that can't be. The user's example shows that even if the original problem has a universal statement, the assumption is listed. So for our case, perhaps the assumption is that sqrt(2) and cube_root(3) are real numbers. But that's obvious. Alternatively, maybe there are no assumptions, but the problem is to show their sum is irrational. However, the user's example included assumptions even when the original problem didn't state them. Wait, the original example's problem didn't have the divisibility by 7, but the formatted problem added it. That suggests that maybe the user made a mistake in their example. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem had a mistake, and the formatted version corrected it. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended that the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. For example, in the original problem, the number A(n) is defined as 5^n(5^n +1) - 6^n(3^n + 2^n), and the problem is to prove it's divisible by 91 for every integer n. Then the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that seems to change the problem. Unless the original problem was mistyped. This is confusing.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the user wants to extract the assumptions from the problem statement. For the current problem, \"Prove that sqrt(2) + cube_root(3) is irrational\", the problem is to prove the sum is irrational. There are no explicit assumptions given in the problem, but implicitly, we assume that sqrt(2) and cube_root(3) are real numbers. However, since the example listed explicit assumptions from the problem, perhaps here we don't have any. Alternatively, if the problem is to prove the sum is irrational, the assumptions would be that sqrt(2) is irrational, cube_root(3) is irrational, but that's part of known mathematics. But the problem doesn't state those as assumptions. Therefore, perhaps in this case, there are no assumptions to list, but according to the user's format, we need to include assumptions. However, the example included assumptions even when the original problem didn't state them. Alternatively, maybe the user's example was incorrect, and the correct way is to list the universal quantifier as an assumption.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I think the safest way is to follow the user's example structure. In their example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption is \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but that changes the problem. Because the original problem was for all integers, but the formatted version restricts to integers divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in their example. But regardless, we need to proceed.\n\nGiven that, perhaps for the current problem, since there are no stated assumptions, we just list the problem as is, with no assumptions. But the user's format requires an assumption section. Alternatively, maybe the assumption is that sqrt(2) and cube_root(3) are algebraic numbers, but that's more advanced. Alternatively, perhaps the problem has no assumptions, and the assumption section is left blank. But the example shows that even if the problem doesn't state assumptions, they are extracted from the problem's context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumption is that the sum is a real number, but that's trivial. Maybe the problem doesn't have any assumptions beyond the definitions of the numbers involved, which are standard. Therefore, in this case, perhaps the assumption section is empty. But the user's example included assumptions. So perhaps the correct approach is to list any implicit assumptions. For example, in the problem to prove sqrt(2) + cube_root(3) is irrational, the assumptions might be:\n\n- sqrt(2) is irrational\n\n- cube_root(3) is irrational\n\nBut the problem doesn't state these; they are known results. But perhaps in the context of the problem, these are the assumptions. However, the problem is to show their sum is irrational, which doesn't follow directly from the sum of two irrationals. Therefore, maybe the assumptions are not listed, and the problem stands alone.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has no assumptions, so we list none. But the user's example included assumptions even when the problem didn't state them, so perhaps we need to include any relevant conditions. But in this case, there are no conditions given. Therefore, perhaps the correct formatted problem is:\n\nAssumption: [none]\n\nProblem: Prove that √2 + ∛3 is irrational.\n\nBut the user's example included assumptions even when the problem didn't have any. Wait, in the example, the original problem was \"for every integer n\", which became an assumption \"n is an integer\". So similarly, for this problem, since there are no variables with quantifiers, maybe there are no assumptions. But the example also added an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) which wasn't in the original problem. That suggests that maybe the user intended to include both the quantifier as an assumption and any other conditions. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants to filter out unrelated information and structure the problem with its essential assumptions. In the given problem, the essential assumptions are that we're dealing with real numbers sqrt(2) and cube_root(3), and the problem is to prove their sum is irrational. But since those are definitions, perhaps there are no assumptions. Therefore, the formatted problem would have no assumptions and just the problem statement.\n\nBut the example had assumptions, so maybe the user expects some here. Alternatively, maybe the assumptions are that sqrt(2) and cube_root(3) exist as real numbers. But that's too basic. Alternatively, perhaps the problem doesn't have any assumptions, so we list none.\n\nGiven the confusion from the example, but following the instruction to \"filter the unrelated information and structure that problem as the following format\", perhaps the correct approach is to list any explicit assumptions from the problem. Since the problem doesn't state any, the assumptions section would be empty. However, the user's example included assumptions even when the problem had a universal quantifier. So in that case, \"for every integer n\" became \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. Similarly, if the current problem had a quantifier, like \"for all real numbers x\", that would be an assumption. But here, the problem is to prove a specific statement about specific numbers, so there are no variables with quantifiers. Therefore, there are no assumptions to list. Thus, the formatted problem would have no assumptions and just the problem statement.\n\nBut the example shows that even if the problem is a universal statement, it's split into assumptions. So perhaps in this case, since there are no variables, the assumptions are none. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: \n\nProblem: Prove that √2 + ∛3 is irrational.\n\nBut the example's assumption section had bullet points. If there are no assumptions, perhaps leave it blank. However, in the user's example, even if the original problem didn't have an assumption, they added one. Wait, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n...\", which was formatted as assumption: n is an integer. Then another assumption: n is divisible by 7. But the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7. That suggests that perhaps the user made a mistake in their example. Because adding \"n is divisible by 7\" changes the problem. Therefore, perhaps the user intended that the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. If the problem is to prove something for every integer n, then the assumption is that n is an integer. But in the example, they added another assumption which wasn't in the original problem, which is confusing.\n\nGiven this confusion, I'll proceed to format the current problem as follows:\n\nAssumption: \n√2 is a real number,\n∛3 is a real number.\n\nProblem: Prove that √2 + ∛3 is irrational.\n\nBut these assumptions are too trivial. Alternatively, since the problem is about irrationality, perhaps the assumptions are that √2 and ∛3 are irrational. But the problem doesn't state that; it's part of what's known. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n√2 is irrational,\n∛3 is irrational.\n\nBut then the problem is to prove their sum is irrational. But in the example, the assumptions were part of the problem's given conditions. Since the current problem doesn't state those as conditions, perhaps they shouldn't be listed as assumptions.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct formatted problem is with no assumptions:\n\nAssumption: \n\nProblem: Prove that √2 + ∛3 is irrational.\n\nBut the example shows that even if the problem has a universal quantifier, it's listed as an assumption. Here, there are no quantifiers, so no assumptions. Therefore, the answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nProblem: Prove that $\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt[3]{3}$ is irrational.\n###",
