    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants to prove that Euler's constant γ is equal to the negative integral from 0 to 1 of ln ln(1/x) dx. They mentioned that solutions they found use corollaries from some theorem, but they want a simpler approach without advanced theorems.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Euler's constant is. γ is defined as the limit of the difference between the harmonic series and the natural logarithm: γ = lim_{n→∞} (1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n - ln n). So maybe the integral is related to this definition.\n\nThe integral given is from 0 to 1 of ln ln(1/x) dx. Let me make a substitution to simplify the integral. Let’s set t = -ln x, which would mean when x approaches 0, t approaches infinity, and when x = 1, t = 0. Then dx = -e^{-t} dt. So changing the limits, the integral becomes the integral from infinity to 0 of ln(t) * (-e^{-t}) dt, which is the same as the integral from 0 to infinity of ln(t) e^{-t} dt. Wait, but that integral is known to be related to the derivative of the Gamma function. Specifically, Γ'(1) = ∫₀^∞ ln(t) e^{-t} dt, and Γ(1) = 1, so Γ'(1) = -γ. Therefore, that integral is -γ, so the original integral would be -(-γ) = γ. But the problem states that γ = -∫₀¹ ln ln(1/x) dx. Wait, maybe I messed up the substitution.\n\nWait, let's check again. Original integral: ∫₀¹ ln(ln(1/x)) dx. Let u = ln(1/x) => u = -ln x, so x = e^{-u}. Then when x=0, u approaches infinity; x=1, u=0. dx = -e^{-u} du. So substituting, the integral becomes ∫_{∞}^0 ln(u) * (-e^{-u}) du = ∫₀^∞ ln(u) e^{-u} du. Which is indeed Γ'(1) = -γ. Therefore, the integral ∫₀¹ ln(ln(1/x)) dx = ∫₀^∞ ln(u) e^{-u} du = -γ. Therefore, γ = -∫₀¹ ln(ln(1/x)) dx. That seems to be the case.\n\nBut the user is asking for a proof without advanced theorems, maybe avoiding the Gamma function. So how else can we approach this?\n\nAlternatively, consider expanding the logarithm or using integral representations of γ. Another approach: express γ as an integral. From the definition, γ can be written as γ = ∫₀^∞ (1/(1 - e^{-t}) - 1/t) e^{-t} dt. Or maybe using the integral representation γ = -∫₀^∞ e^{-t} ln t dt, which is exactly the integral we obtained. But how to connect this with the definition of γ without invoking Gamma function derivatives?\n\nLet me think. Starting from the definition: γ = lim_{n→∞} (H_n - ln n), where H_n is the nth harmonic number. We can express H_n as ∫₀¹ (1 - x^n)/(1 - x) dx. Then H_n - ln n = ∫₀¹ (1 - x^{n})/(1 - x) dx - ln n. Maybe manipulate this expression to get an integral that relates to the given one.\n\nAlternatively, consider writing ln n as ∫₁^n 1/t dt. Then H_n - ln n = (sum_{k=1}^n 1/k) - ∫₁^n 1/t dt. The sum can be approximated by integrals. But maybe this approach isn't directly leading to the integral in question.\n\nWait, another integral representation of γ is γ = ∫₀^1 (1/(1 - x) + 1/ln x) dx. Let me check that. If we can derive that, then perhaps we can connect it to the given integral.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the integral ∫₀¹ ln(ln(1/x)) dx. Let me substitute x = e^{-t}, so dx = -e^{-t} dt, and when x=0, t→∞; x=1, t=0. So the integral becomes ∫_{∞}^0 ln(t) (-e^{-t}) dt = ∫₀^∞ ln(t) e^{-t} dt. Now, how to relate this to γ?\n\nWe know that γ is the limit as n approaches infinity of [sum_{k=1}^n 1/k - ln n]. Also, there's an integral representation for γ as the integral from 0 to infinity of (1/(1 - e^{-t}) - 1/t) e^{-t} dt. But perhaps we can express ∫₀^∞ ln(t) e^{-t} dt in terms of γ.\n\nAlternatively, recall that the integral ∫₀^∞ e^{-t} ln t dt is equal to -γ. Therefore, ∫₀^∞ ln t e^{-t} dt = -γ, hence ∫₀¹ ln(ln(1/x)) dx = -γ. Therefore, γ = -∫₀¹ ln(ln(1/x)) dx, which is the desired result.\n\nBut if we cannot reference the Gamma function, how to show that ∫₀^∞ e^{-t} ln t dt = -γ? Maybe using the definition of γ and expanding the integral.\n\nConsider integrating e^{-t} ln t from 0 to ∞. Let's write ln t as the integral from 1 to t of (1/s) ds. Wait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, use differentiation under the integral sign. Let’s consider Γ(s) = ∫₀^∞ t^{s-1} e^{-t} dt. Then Γ’(s) = ∫₀^∞ t^{s-1} ln t e^{-t} dt. Then Γ’(1) = ∫₀^∞ ln t e^{-t} dt. But Γ(1) = 1, and Γ’(1) = -γ. Therefore, the integral is -γ. But this uses the derivative of the Gamma function, which might be considered advanced.\n\nAlternatively, using the integral definition of γ. From the limit definition, γ = lim_{n→∞} (H_n - ln n). Let's try to express this limit as an integral. H_n = sum_{k=1}^n 1/k. We can write this sum as ∫₀¹ (1 - x^n)/(1 - x) dx. Then H_n - ln n = ∫₀¹ (1 - x^{n})/(1 - x) dx - ∫₁^n (1/t) dt. Changing variables in the second integral to x = 1/t, but maybe not directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, express H_n as ∫₀¹ (1 - x^{n})/(1 - x) dx. Then H_n - ln n = ∫₀¹ (1 - x^{n})/(1 - x) dx - ln n. Let’s split the integral into ∫₀¹ [1/(1 - x) - x^{n}/(1 - x)] dx. The first term is divergent, but combining with ln n might regularize it. Let’s make substitution x = 1 - t/n. Then as n tends to infinity, but this approach might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, recall that ∫₀^∞ e^{-t} ln t dt = -γ can be derived by differentiating the integral ∫₀^∞ t^{s-1} e^{-t} dt = Γ(s) at s=1. The derivative Γ’(1) = -γ. But maybe this is considered advanced.\n\nIf the user wants a solution without advanced theorems, perhaps they can use integration by parts on the original integral. Let’s try integrating ln(ln(1/x)) from 0 to 1. Let me set u = ln(ln(1/x)), dv = dx. Then du = [1/(ln(1/x))] * (1/x) dx = [1/(-ln x)] * (-1/x) dx = [1/(x ln x)] dx. And v = x. So integration by parts gives uv from 0 to 1 minus ∫ v du. The uv term is [x ln(ln(1/x))] from 0 to 1. At x=1, ln(ln(1)) = ln(0) which is -infty, but multiplied by x=1 gives -infty. At x=0, x approaches 0 and ln(ln(1/x)) approaches ln(infty) which is infty, but multiplied by x approaching 0. This seems indeterminate; perhaps the boundary terms are zero? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe this approach isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, switch variables in the original integral. Let t = ln(1/x), so x = e^{-t}, dx = -e^{-t} dt. Then the integral becomes ∫_{t=∞}^{t=0} ln(t) * (-e^{-t}) dt = ∫₀^∞ ln(t) e^{-t} dt. Now, how to relate this to γ?\n\nFrom the definition of γ as the limit of H_n - ln n, perhaps express H_n as an integral and relate it to the integral of ln t e^{-t} dt. For example, H_n can be written as ∫₀¹ (1 - x^n)/(1 - x) dx. Then H_n - ln n = ∫₀¹ (1 - x^n)/(1 - x) dx - ∫₁^n (1/t) dt. Changing variable in the second integral with t = 1/x, then dt = -1/x² dx. So when t=1, x=1; t=n, x=1/n. Then ∫₁^n (1/t) dt = ∫_{1/n}^1 (1/(1/x)) * (1/x²) dx) = ∫_{1/n}^1 x/x² dx = ∫_{1/n}^1 1/x dx = ln 1 - ln(1/n) = ln n. Wait, that just confirms the integral. So maybe this approach isn't helping.\n\nAlternatively, consider expanding ln(ln(1/x)) as a series. But ln(ln(1/x)) = ln(-ln x). If x is near 1, then ln x ≈ x - 1, so ln(-ln x) ≈ ln(1 - x). But this seems messy.\n\nAnother idea: relate the integral to the integral representation of γ. For example, γ can be expressed as ∫₀^∞ (1/(1 - e^{-t}) - 1/t) e^{-t} dt. Let me verify this. Let's compute:\n\n∫₀^∞ [1/(1 - e^{-t}) - 1/t] e^{-t} dt = ∫₀^∞ [e^{-t}/(1 - e^{-t}) - e^{-t}/t] dt. The first term simplifies to ∫₀^∞ e^{-t}/(1 - e^{-t}) dt = ∫₀^∞ (e^{-t}/(1 - e^{-t})) dt. Let u = e^{-t}, du = -e^{-t} dt, so the integral becomes ∫₁^0 u/(1 - u) (-1/u) du = ∫₀¹ 1/(1 - u) du, which diverges. So maybe this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, there's another integral representation: γ = ∫₀^∞ (1/(1 + t) - e^{-t}) /t dt. But I'm not sure. Maybe using Frullani integral? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, recall that γ is also the limit as ε approaches 0 of [∫_ε^1 (1/(1 - x) dx) - ∫_ε^1 (1/ln x) dx]. Wait, let's see. ∫ (1/(1 - x) + 1/ln x) dx from 0 to 1 is equal to -γ. Maybe this can be related.\n\nIf we consider the integral ∫₀¹ ln(ln(1/x)) dx, and through substitution, we connected it to ∫₀^∞ ln t e^{-t} dt = -γ. So the answer is straightforward once you know the substitution and the relation between that integral and γ. The key step is the substitution t = -ln x, which converts the original integral into the integral of ln t e^{-t} dt from 0 to ∞, which equals -γ. Therefore, the original integral is -γ, so γ = -∫₀¹ ln(ln(1/x)) dx.\n\nBut to present this without invoking Gamma functions, perhaps the solution would proceed via substitution and then state that the resulting integral is known to be -γ, referencing the definition of γ. But how to show that ∫₀^∞ ln t e^{-t} dt = -γ without using Gamma function properties?\n\nAlternatively, starting from the definition of γ as the limit of H_n - ln n, and expressing H_n as an integral, then subtracting ln n, and manipulating the expression to arrive at the integral. Let's try that.\n\nH_n = sum_{k=1}^n 1/k. We can write this as ∫₀¹ (1 - x^n)/(1 - x) dx. Then H_n - ln n = ∫₀¹ (1 - x^n)/(1 - x) dx - ∫₁^n (1/t) dt. Let’s change variable in the second integral to x = 1/t, so when t=1, x=1; t=n, x=1/n. Then ∫₁^n (1/t) dt = ∫_{1/n}^1 (1/(1/x)) (-1/x²) dx) = ∫_{1/n}^1 (x) (-1/x²) dx = ∫_{1/n}^1 -1/x dx = ∫₁^{1/n} 1/x dx = ln(1/n) - ln 1 = -ln n. Wait, this doesn't seem right. Wait, original substitution: t = 1/x, so dt = -1/x² dx, so dx = -x² dt. Then ∫₁^n (1/t) dt = ∫_{x=1}^{x=1/n} (1/(1/x)) (-x²) dx) = ∫₁^{1/n} x * (-x²) dx. Hmm, this seems confusing. Maybe a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, express ln n as ∫₁^n (1/t) dt. So H_n - ln n = sum_{k=1}^n 1/k - ∫₁^n (1/t) dt. This can be rewritten as sum_{k=1}^n ∫_{k}^{k+1} (1/k - 1/t) dt. Because each term 1/k is constant over [k, k+1), and ∫_{k}^{k+1} 1/k dt = 1/k, and ∫_{k}^{k+1} 1/t dt = ln(k+1) - ln k. So sum_{k=1}^n [1/k - (ln(k+1) - ln k)] = sum_{k=1}^n 1/k - sum_{k=1}^n (ln(k+1) - ln k) = sum_{k=1}^n 1/k - ln(n+1). Then H_n - ln(n+1) approaches γ as n→∞. But H_n - ln n = (H_n - ln(n+1)) + (ln(n+1) - ln n). As n→∞, ln(n+1) - ln n = ln(1 + 1/n) ~ 1/n → 0. So the limit is still γ.\n\nBut how to connect this to the integral ∫₀^∞ ln t e^{-t} dt = -γ? Maybe consider the integral representation of the exponential function. We know that ∫₀^∞ e^{-t} dt = 1, and ∫₀^∞ t e^{-t} dt = 1!, ∫₀^∞ t^n e^{-t} dt = n!. But for ∫₀^∞ ln t e^{-t} dt, we can differentiate under the integral sign with respect to a parameter. Let’s consider Γ(s) = ∫₀^∞ t^{s-1} e^{-t} dt. Then Γ’(s) = ∫₀^∞ t^{s-1} ln t e^{-t} dt. So Γ’(1) = ∫₀^∞ ln t e^{-t} dt. But Γ(1) = 1, and it's known that Γ’(1) = -γ. Therefore, the integral is -γ.\n\nBut if the user doesn't want to use Gamma function, perhaps this is not acceptable. Alternatively, use the limit definition. Let’s consider the integral ∫₀^∞ ln t e^{-t} dt. Write e^{-t} as the limit of (1 - t/n)^n as n approaches infinity. Then interchange the limit and integral. However, this is heuristic and requires justification. Alternatively, use the expansion of ln t and relate it to the integral.\n\nAlternatively, integrate by parts. Let’s set u = ln t, dv = e^{-t} dt. Then du = (1/t) dt, v = -e^{-t}. So ∫ ln t e^{-t} dt = -ln t e^{-t} + ∫ e^{-t}/t dt. Evaluated from 0 to ∞. The first term: as t→∞, ln t e^{-t} approaches 0. At t=0, ln t approaches -infty, but e^{-t}=1, so the term is - ( -infty * 0 ), which is an indeterminate form. Need to check the limit as t→0+ of -ln t e^{-t} = -ln t (1 - t + ...) ≈ -ln t. As t→0+, ln t → -infty, so the limit is +infty. But the other term is ∫₀^∞ e^{-t}/t dt, which diverges. So integration by parts leads to an indeterminate form minus a divergent integral. This seems problematic.\n\nWait, but we know that the original integral ∫₀^∞ ln t e^{-t} dt converges. So maybe this approach isn't helpful.\n\nAnother idea: Express ln t as the derivative of t^s at s=0. Because d/ds t^s = t^s ln t. So ∫₀^∞ ln t e^{-t} dt = d/ds ∫₀^∞ t^s e^{-t} dt evaluated at s=0. That is, Γ’(1) = d/ds Γ(s+1) at s=0. But Γ(s+1) = s Γ(s), so Γ’(1) = Γ’(1) = -γ. Again, this uses the Gamma function.\n\nGiven that all these approaches seem to relate to the Gamma function, which might be considered advanced, the user might be expecting a different route. Maybe express the integral as a sum involving the exponential function's series expansion?\n\nAlternatively, recall that γ can be expressed as an integral involving the function 1/t - 1/(e^t - 1). But this might not help directly.\n\nAt this point, it seems the most straightforward path is the substitution t = -ln x, which transforms the original integral into ∫₀^∞ ln t e^{-t} dt, and then referencing that this integral equals -γ. However, if one is to avoid mentioning the Gamma function, they might need to accept that this integral is a known representation of -γ. Perhaps citing a source like Wikipedia or Mathworld where this integral is mentioned as a definition or property of Euler's constant.\n\nIn conclusion, the key steps are:\n\n1. Perform substitution t = -ln x to convert the original integral into ∫₀^∞ ln t e^{-t} dt.\n2. Recognize that this integral equals -γ based on known integral representations of Euler's constant.\n\nTherefore, γ = -∫₀¹ ln(ln(1/x)) dx.\n\nBut to make this accessible without advanced theorems, the solution would focus on the substitution step and state that the resulting integral is a known result for Euler's constant. If the student is not familiar with this result, they might need to accept it as a given integral representation, which can be found in mathematical references.",
