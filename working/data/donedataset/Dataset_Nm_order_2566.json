    "Content": "Original problem Suppose $K$ is a field, $f,g\\in K[x]$ and $\\gcd(f,g)=1$. $V$ is a linear space based on $K$ and $\\phi\\in\\operatorname{End}(V)$.\nNotation $f_\\phi$ and $g_\\phi$ denote linear transformations $f(\\phi)$ and $g(\\phi)$. Try to show that $$\\ker(f_\\phi g_\\phi)=\\ker(f_\\phi)\\oplus\\ker(g_\\phi)$$ The sketch of the proof Notice that sub-ring $K[\\phi]\\subseteq\\operatorname{End}(V)$ is commutative, and $f_\\phi,g_\\phi\\in K[\\phi]$, so it's easy to show that $\\ker(f_\\phi),\\ker (g_\\phi)\\subseteq\\ker(f_\\phi g_\\phi)$. $\\because\\gcd(f,g)=1$, $\\therefore\\exists u,v\\in K[x]: uf+vg=1\\implies u_\\phi f_\\phi+v_\\phi g_\\phi=I_V$, where $I_V$ is the identity operator of $V$. $\\forall x\\in\\ker(f_\\phi g_\\phi)$, plug $x$ into the preceding equation, we have $x=u_\\phi f_\\phi(x)+v_\\phi g_\\phi(x)$, and it's not quite difficult to show that $u_\\phi f_\\phi(x)\\in\\ker(g_\\phi)$ and $v_\\phi g_\\phi(x)\\in\\ker(f_\\phi)$, so $x\\in\\ker(f_\\phi)+\\ker(g_\\phi)$. $\\forall x\\in\\ker(f_\\phi)\\cap\\ker(g_\\phi)$, plug $x$ into that equation and we have $x=0$, so $\\ker(f_\\phi)\\cap\\ker(g_\\phi)=0$, Q.E.D Thoughts It seems that the proposition is quite similar to Chinese Remainder Theorem, say:\n$$\\mathbb Z/mn\\mathbb Z\\cong\\mathbb Z/m\\mathbb Z\\oplus\\mathbb Z/n\\mathbb Z$$\nif $\\gcd(m,n)=1$. Can we find the deeper relationship between these two propositions? Or just an unique aspect? Thanks!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I think one analogy is being crossed-up with another. For one thing, your work shows that $f_\\phi$ and $g_\\phi$ are coprime in the ring $K[\\phi]$, and so $K[\\phi]/(f_\\phi g_\\phi)\\cong K[\\phi]/(f_\\phi)\\oplus K[\\phi]/(g_\\phi)$ would be a better analogy with the Chinese remainder theorem comment on $\\Bbb Z$ that you made, both of these being ring decompositions. Since the kernel equation ceases to talk about $f_\\phi$ and $g_\\phi$ as elements of a ring of transformations $V\\rightarrow V$, and instead switches to their kernels, the analogy with $\\Bbb Z$ is lost. It's not clear what the elements of $\\Bbb Z$ should be operating on to produce kernels. However, if we allowed elements of $\\Bbb Z$ to act as maps from $\\Bbb Z\\rightarrow \\Bbb Z/(k)$ for different $k$'s, then the kernels produced would be subgroups of $\\Bbb Z$, which are all cyclic of course. And it is true that the cyclic group equation $C_n\\times C_m\\cong C_{mn}$ when $m$ and $n$ are coprime. This might be the closest relative of your kernel equation. A final difference to note is that the kernel equation is taking place in a vector space (a $K$ module), and we know that vector spaces decompose very nicely. On the other hand, $\\Bbb Z$ modules do not have these nice decomposition properties.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about showing that the kernel of the composition of two linear transformations, f_phi and g_phi, is the direct sum of their individual kernels. The user also wants to relate this to the Chinese Remainder Theorem.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The problem states that K is a field, f and g are polynomials in K[x] with gcd 1. V is a linear space over K, and phi is an endomorphism of V. The notation f_phi and g_phi are the linear transformations obtained by evaluating f and g at phi. \n\nSo, each assumption should be one line, addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let's break it down:\n\n1. K is a field. That's a basic assumption about the underlying field.\n2. f and g are elements of K[x]. They are polynomials over K.\n3. The greatest common divisor of f and g is 1. That's an important condition for the problem.\n4. V is a vector space over K. So, the space is defined over the field.\n5. phi is an element of End(V), meaning it's an endomorphism on V.\n6. The transformations f_phi and g_phi are the evaluations of f and g at phi, which are linear transformations on V. I should note that they are linear transformations in the endomorphism ring.\n\nNow the problem statement is to show that the kernel of f_phi g_phi is the direct sum of the kernels of f_phi and g_phi. The user also relates this to the Chinese Remainder Theorem, but the main problem to structure is the kernel decomposition. The thoughts about CRT are part of the original question's context but maybe not part of the problem statement itself unless the user wants it included. But looking at the example given, the problem part is just the main question, while the thoughts might be additional context. However, in the example, the assumption included the divisibility by 7, which was part of the original problem. Here, the problem as stated in the title and the main question is to show the kernel decomposition. The CRT connection is more of a follow-up thought. So, I should focus on structuring the main problem first.\n\nSo, the problem part should be: Show that ker(f_phi g_phi) = ker(f_phi) ⊕ ker(g_phi).\n\nNow, check if all the assumptions are listed properly. Let's see:\n\n- K is a field: yes.\n- f, g ∈ K[x]: yes.\n- gcd(f, g) = 1: crucial for the existence of u and v such that uf + vg = 1.\n- V is a linear space over K: yes.\n- phi ∈ End(V): yes.\n- f_phi and g_phi are linear transformations in End(V) obtained by substituting phi into f and g: yes. But wait, in the original problem statement, they mention that K[phi] is a commutative subring of End(V), and f_phi, g_phi are in K[phi]. However, in the example provided, the assumptions are straightforward. Do I need to include that K[phi] is commutative? The original problem's sketch mentions that K[phi] is commutative, which is important for f_phi and g_phi commuting. However, maybe the key assumption is that f_phi and g_phi commute? But since phi is an endomorphism, and f_phi and g_phi are polynomials in phi, they automatically commute. So maybe that's a consequence rather than an assumption. The user's example included the divisibility by 7 as an assumption, which was part of the problem's hypothesis. In this case, the problem states that gcd(f, g) = 1, which is given, so that's an assumption. The rest are definitions of the objects involved.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should list all the given conditions:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- K is a field.\n- f and g are elements of K[x].\n- The greatest common divisor of f and g is 1.\n- V is a vector space over K.\n- phi is an endomorphism of V.\n- f_phi and g_phi are linear transformations on V defined by evaluating f and g at phi.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"notation f_phi and g_phi denote linear transformations f(phi) and g(phi)\", so maybe that's part of the problem's setup. Therefore, those are part of the assumptions. So each point is one line, one condition. So yes, each of these is an assumption.\n\nSo, compiling all:\n\nAssumption:\nK is a field,\nf and g are elements of K[x],\nthe greatest common divisor of f and g is 1,\nV is a vector space over K,\nphi is an endomorphism of V,\nf_phi and g_phi are linear transformations on V defined by f(phi) and g(phi).\n\nProblem:\nShow that ker(f_phi g_phi) = ker(f_phi) ⊕ ker(g_phi).\n\nComparing to the example, the problem part is concise. The user's thoughts about CRT are part of the original question but not the problem statement itself. The example didn't include the additional thoughts in the formatted problem. So, the formatted problem should include only the main problem to show the kernel decomposition. The CRT connection is part of the user's thoughts but not the problem to be formatted.",
