Having established these tools, is it possible to prove that an open subset of $ \\mathbb{R}^n $ and an open subset of $ \\mathbb{R}^m $ can't be homeomorphic unless $ n = m $ without refering to all those more advanced things which are normally used here, such as homology theory and algebraic topology?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If $V$, open subset of $\\Bbb R^m$, were homeomorphic to an open subset of $\\Bbb R^n$, $U$, let $f: U \\to V$ be a homeomorphism. (Suppose WLOG that $m \\leq n$.) Compose with a linear inclusion map $\\Bbb R^m \\hookrightarrow \\Bbb R^n$ to get a continuous injective map $U \\to \\Bbb R^n$ with image contained in the subspace $\\Bbb R^m$ , as it factors as $U \\to V \\subset \\Bbb R^m \\hookrightarrow \\Bbb R^n$. If $m < n$, the image cannot be open - any neighborhood of a point in the hyperplane contains points not in the hyperplane. Therefore $m=n$. So invariance of domain implies invariance of dimension. Of course, this says even more: there's not even a continuous injection $U \\to V$ between open sets of $\\Bbb R^n, \\Bbb R^m$ respectively, $n>m$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should list each condition applied to one object, and then state the problem clearly.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question. The title mentions proving topological invariance of dimension using Brouwer's fixed point and invariance of domain theorems. The question asks if, after establishing Brouwer's fixed point and invariance of domain theorems, one can prove that open subsets of R^n and R^m aren't homeomorphic unless n=m without using advanced tools like homology or algebraic topology.\n\nSo, the main problem is to prove that open subsets of R^n and R^m can't be homeomorphic unless n=m. The assumptions here would be the tools already established: Brouwer's fixed point theorem and invariance of domain theorem. Also, the problem specifies not using more advanced methods like homology or algebraic topology.\n\nI need to list each assumption line by line. Let me check:\n\n1. Brouwer's fixed point theorem is established.\n2. Invariance of domain theorem is established.\n3. The proof should not refer to advanced methods like homology theory.\n4. The proof should not refer to algebraic topology.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement mentions \"using Brouwer's fixed point and invariance of domain theorems\". So those are the tools allowed. The constraints are not using homology or algebraic topology. So each of these would be separate assumptions.\n\nSo, structuring:\n\nAssumptions:\n- Brouwer's fixed point theorem is available.\n- Invariance of domain theorem is available.\n- The proof must not use homology theory.\n- The proof must not use algebraic topology.\n\nProblem: Prove that an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ and an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^m$ cannot be homeomorphic unless $n = m$.\n\nWait, but in the example given, the assumptions were about the object (n is integer, n divisible by 7). Here, the assumptions are about the theorems available and the restrictions on methods. However, the example's assumptions were properties of the objects in the problem. The current problem's assumptions are about the allowed theorems and forbidden methods. The user's instructions say \"assumption addresses only one property or condition, applied to one object\". Hmm, maybe I need to adjust.\n\nWait, in the example, the assumption was about the properties of n (the object in the problem). Here, the problem's objects are the open subsets of R^n and R^m. The allowed theorems (Brouwer's fixed point, invariance of domain) are tools, not properties of the objects. Similarly, the forbidden methods (homology, algebraic topology) are restrictions on the approach.\n\nBut according to the user's example, assumptions are about the problem's conditions. However, in the example, the original problem had an error: the formatted problem added an assumption that \"n is divisible by 7\", but the original problem didn't state that. Wait, the original example's original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem added an assumption \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in their example? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That changes the problem. Maybe the example is flawed. But regardless, the user's instruction says to structure the problem with assumptions listed, each being a single property/condition applied to one object.\n\nIn the current problem, the user is asking if it's possible to prove invariance of dimension (that open subsets of R^n and R^m aren't homeomorphic unless n=m) using Brouwer's fixed point and invariance of domain theorems, without using more advanced tools. So the assumptions here are that Brouwer's fixed point and invariance of domain are already established, and the proof must not use homology theory or algebraic topology. But the problem's objects are the open subsets. However, the assumptions are about the methods allowed, not the objects' properties.\n\nThis seems conflicting with the example given. The example had assumptions about the object (n). But here, the assumptions are about the methods. Maybe the user wants to list the available theorems as assumptions. For example:\n\nAssumption:\n- Brouwer's fixed point theorem is available.\n- Invariance of domain theorem is available.\n- The proof does not use homology theory.\n- The proof does not use algebraic topology.\n\nProblem: Prove that an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ and an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^m$ cannot be homeomorphic unless $n = m$.\n\nBut the original example's assumptions were properties of the objects in the problem. Here, these are more like given tools and constraints on the proof method. The user might have intended for assumptions to include both the given theorems and the restrictions. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply to state the problem with the given tools, so the assumptions are that Brouwer's fixed point and invariance of domain are available. The constraints (not using homology, etc.) are part of the problem statement.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the assumptions listed were additional conditions (even if they weren't in the original problem). Wait, the original problem in the example was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. The original problem had no such assumption. Therefore, perhaps the user's example is incorrect. Maybe the user intended to extract the implicit assumptions. However, in that case, maybe the user's example is wrong, but we need to follow their format regardless.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the example, the user made a mistake, but the correct approach is to list all the problem's conditions as assumptions, even if they are part of the original problem's statement. For example, in the original problem, \"for every integer n\" is a condition, so the assumption is \"n is an integer\". Then the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. However, the formatted example added \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original problem. That seems like an error.\n\nBut maybe the example was for a different problem where n needed to be divisible by 7. Anyway, perhaps the user wants to list all the given conditions as assumptions. So in the current problem, the given conditions are that Brouwer's fixed point and invariance of domain are already proven, and the proof shouldn't use homology or algebraic topology. So each of these would be separate assumptions.\n\nTherefore, structuring the problem accordingly.",
