    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's start by reading the original problem from Math Stack Exchange. The user wants to know two things: whether the function f(x) defined as the reciprocal of the floor of 1/x (and 0 at x=0) is Riemann integrable on [0,1], and if so, to compute the integral. The user also provided their attempt using upper and lower sums with a specific partition, leading to bounds involving π²/6. They mention using MATLAB to find the integral equals π²/6 - 1, but the problem statement in the title claims the integral is 1/2² + 1/3² + 1/4² + ..., which is actually (π²/6 - 1) since the sum from n=1 to ∞ of 1/n² is π²/6, so starting from n=2 would subtract 1.\n\nFirst, I need to structure the problem according to the given format. The key here is to extract the assumptions and state the problem clearly. The function f(x) is defined piecewise: it's 0 at x=0 and the reciprocal of the floor of 1/x for 0 < x ≤ 1. The problem asks about Riemann integrability and the value of the integral.\n\nAssumptions should list each condition. The function is defined on [0,1], with specific definitions at x=0 and 0 < x ≤1. The floor function here is applied to 1/x. Each assumption line should address one property or object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) is defined on the interval [0,1],\nFor x=0, f(x)=0,\nFor 0 < x ≤1, f(x)=1/floor(1/x),\nThe problem is about Riemann integrability of f(x) on [0,1],\nThe problem asks to compute the integral of f(x) from 0 to1 if integrable.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption line should address only one property applied to one object. So breaking it down:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) is defined on [0,1],\nAt x=0, f(x) = 0,\nFor 0 < x ≤1, f(x) = 1/floor(1/x),\nThe question is about Riemann integrability of f(x) on [0,1],\nIf integrable, compute ∫₀¹ f(x) dx.\n\nBut in the example, the assumption included the conditions on n. Here, the function's definition and the interval are key. The problem is to prove the integral equals the given series. However, the original problem's title states the integral equals the series starting from 1/2², which matches the computation result π²/6 -1. But the user's own attempt seems to have conflicting bounds. Wait, the user's upper sum approaches π²/6 -1, lower sum approaches 2 - π²/6. However, the integral must lie between these two, but the user says MATLAB gives π²/6 -1. The problem in the title states it's equal to the series starting from 1/2², which is equivalent to π²/6 -1. So the actual problem is to compute the integral and show it's equal to that series. The original question also asks about Riemann integrability, which the user attempted by noting f is increasing, non-negative, and bounded, hence integrable. But the user's partition approach led to conflicting bounds, but the correct answer is found via MATLAB. So the problem as per the user's title is to show the integral equals the series. The assumptions would include the definition of f(x) and the interval. So structuring:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) is defined on [0,1],\nAt x=0, f(x)=0,\nFor 0 < x ≤1, f(x)=1/floor(1/x),\nThe problem asks if f is Riemann integrable on [0,1],\nIf integrable, compute ∫₀¹ f(x) dx.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions are listed line by line, each for one property. So maybe each line is a separate assumption:\n\nAssumption:\nThe function f is defined on the interval [0,1],\nAt x=0, f(x) = 0,\nFor each x in (0,1], f(x) = 1/floor(1/x),\nThe problem concerns the Riemann integrability of f on [0,1],\nIf integrable, the problem requires computing the integral of f from 0 to 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that ∫₀¹ ⌊1/x⌋⁻¹ dx = 1/2² + 1/3² + 1/4² + ⋯.\n\nBut the original problem's title is phrased as proving the integral equals that series. The user's question also includes whether f is Riemann integrable, but the example given by the user in the initial prompt had assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, the key assumptions are about the definition of f and the interval.\n\nWait, the example given by the user for formatting was:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn is divisible by 7.\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut in the original problem, the user might have mistakenly added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be an error, but perhaps the example is illustrative. However, in our current problem, the assumptions are about the definition of f(x) and its domain.\n\nSo following the example, each assumption line should list a single condition applied to one object. So for the current problem:\n\nAssumption:\nThe domain of f is the interval [0,1],\nf(x) = 0 when x = 0,\nFor 0 < x ≤1, f(x) = 1/floor(1/x),\nThe problem asks about Riemann integrability of f on [0,1],\nThe problem requires computing the integral of f over [0,1] if integrable.\n\nBut perhaps the Riemann integrability is part of the problem, not an assumption. The problem is to determine if f is Riemann integrable and compute the integral if so. The example's assumptions were on the variables in the problem. Here, the assumptions are the definition of f. So:\n\nAssumption:\nFunction f is defined on [0,1],\nf(x)=0 at x=0,\nFor x ∈ (0,1], f(x) = 1/floor(1/x).\n\nThen the problem is: Is f Riemann integrable on [0,1]? If yes, compute ∫₀¹ f(x)dx.\n\nBut the user's title states the integral equals the series, so perhaps the problem as per the title is to prove that the integral equals that series, assuming f is integrable. But the original question also asks about integrability. So the problem as per the user's post is two parts: integrability and value. So structuring:\n\nProblem: Is f(x) Riemann integrable on [0,1]? If yes, compute ∫₀¹ ⌊1/x⌋⁻¹dx and show it equals 1/2² +1/3² +1/4² +⋯.\n\nBut in the example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, with assumptions on n. Here, the assumptions are on the definition of f. The problem is to determine integrability and compute the integral. But the user's title only states the integral equals the series. However, the original question has two parts. Therefore, the formatted problem should include both parts. But the example only included the problem statement. So the user wants to structure the problem as:\n\nAssumption: [list of conditions]\n\nProblem: [the problem to solve]\n\nIn the example, the assumption included conditions on n, even though the original problem was for every integer n. Maybe there was a mistake. But in our case, the assumptions are the definition of the function. So:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) is defined on [0,1],\nf(x) = 0 when x=0,\nFor 0 < x ≤1, f(x) = 1/floor(1/x).\n\nProblem: Is f Riemann integrable on [0,1]? If yes, prove that ∫₀¹ f(x)dx = 1/2² +1/3² +1/4² +⋯.\n\nAlternatively, since the title states the equality, perhaps the problem is to prove the integral equals the series, given the function's definition.\n\nBut according to the user's original problem, the question is two parts: integrability and value. However, in the example, the formatted problem only includes the problem statement. Perhaps the user wants to extract the main problem, which is to compute the integral and show it equals the series, assuming integrability (since the user's attempt already claims integrability via monotonicity, etc.). But according to the instructions, we need to filter unrelated information and structure the problem. The user's attempt mentions that f is increasing, non-negative, and bounded, hence integrable. But the problem as per the title is about the value of the integral. So maybe the key problem is to compute the integral, with the function's definition as assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have assumptions about the function's definition, and the problem is to compute the integral, which equals the series. The integrability is part of the problem, but perhaps the user's attempt already answers that, so the main task is to compute the integral. But the original problem's question is two-part. However, the example given by the user in their initial prompt included assumptions and then the problem statement. So following that, the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem, and the problem is the actual question. So:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) is defined on [0,1],\nAt x=0, f(x)=0,\nFor 0 < x ≤1, f(x)=1/floor(1/x).\n\nProblem: Prove that ∫₀¹ f(x)dx = 1/2² +1/3² +1/4² +⋯.\n\nBut the original problem also asks about Riemann integrability. However, the example didn't include the proof part in the problem statement. In the example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, with assumptions on n. Here, the problem is to compute the integral, but first determine integrability. However, the user's title states the integral equals the series, so perhaps the main problem is that, with the integrability being a preliminary step. But according to the user's instructions, the formatted problem should include the problem as stated, filtering unrelated info. The original problem has two questions: integrability and value. The user's own attempt addresses integrability by stating f is increasing, hence integrable. But the formatted problem should capture both parts? Or just the main question as per the title?\n\nThe example given by the user in the initial prompt had the original problem asking to prove divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem listed assumptions (including a possibly incorrect one about n divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem). Wait, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems to be a mistake. However, the user's example might be illustrative. Therefore, perhaps the assistant should focus on the main problem, extracting key assumptions and the core problem.\n\nIn the current case, the problem is to prove the integral equals the series. The assumptions are the definition of f. So:\n\nAssumption:\nFunction f is defined on [0,1],\nf(x) = 0 at x=0,\nFor 0 < x ≤1, f(x) = 1/floor(1/x).\n\nProblem: Prove that ∫₀¹ f(x)dx = 1/2² +1/3² +1/4² +⋯.\n\nBut the original question also asks about integrability. However, perhaps that's considered part of the problem, or maybe the problem assumes integrability. Since the user's attempt claims that f is increasing, hence integrable, but the problem as posed in the title is about the value. Maybe the formatted problem should include both parts. However, the example given by the user didn't include multiple questions. In the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem was to prove that given certain assumptions. Here, the original problem has two questions, but the title focuses on the integral's value. Hence, perhaps the main problem is to compute the integral, and the integrability is a preliminary step. However, the user's instructions say to structure the problem according to the example. The example included the problem statement as \"Prove that...\", so here it would be \"Prove that the integral equals...\".\n\nBut the original problem's first question is about integrability. However, the user's attempt already addresses that, and the title focuses on the integral's value. Hence, the formatted problem should probably focus on the integral's value, with the assumptions including the definition of f.
