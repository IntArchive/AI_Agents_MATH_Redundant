    "Content": "I know that I can find a basis for the column space of a matrix $A$ by reducing the matrix to reduced row echelon form $J$. The columns of $A$ corresponding to the linearly independent columns of $J$ then form a basis for $Col(A)$, because linear dependence is preserved under elementary row operations. I can't figure out why this is true though, and a google search returns nothing, so I'm sure it's simple. Can someone give me a proof?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let's start out from the standard basis $e_1,..,e_n$. Let $a_1,..,a_k$ be the column vectors of $A$. Check that the step on rows $r_i':=r_i+\\lambda\\,r_j$ corresponds to the basis transformation $e_j':=e_j-\\lambda\\,e_i$, that is, for a vector $v$ we have\n$$v=\\sum_i\\alpha_ie_i=\\sum_i\\alpha_i'e_i'$$\nwhere the row transformation is made for the coordinate vector\n$\\pmatrix{\\alpha_1\\\\ \\alpha_2\\\\ \\vdots} \\leadsto \\pmatrix{\\alpha_1'\\\\ \\alpha_2'\\\\ \\vdots}$. So, in this interpretation the column vectors all \"stay\" where they are in the $n$ dimensional space, but we keep on changing the basis. Of course, the vectors stay (in-)dependent. The crucial thing here is that we get another basis when applying (the inverse of) each step of the row transformation.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user is asking why elementary row operations preserve the linear dependence relations between the columns of a matrix. Hmm, I need to break this down.\n\nFirst, let me recall what elementary row operations are. They include row swaps, scaling a row by a non-zero scalar, and adding a multiple of one row to another. These operations are used in Gaussian elimination to simplify matrices into row-echelon form.\n\nNow, the key point here is about linear dependence between columns. If columns are linearly dependent before row operations, they should remain dependent after, and vice versa. So, the problem is essentially asking why the column dependencies are invariant under these operations.\n\nLet me think about how row operations affect the columns. Suppose we have a matrix A with columns c1, c2, ..., cn. If there's a non-trivial linear combination a1c1 + ... + ancn = 0, then after applying row operations, this relation should still hold. But why?\n\nElementary row operations can be represented by multiplication by invertible matrices (elementary matrices). So, applying an elementary row operation is like multiplying A by an invertible matrix E. The new matrix becomes EA, and its columns are Ec1, Ec2, ..., Ecn. \n\nIf a1c1 + ... + ancn = 0, then multiplying both sides by E gives a1Ec1 + ... + anEcn = 0. So the same coefficients a1,...,an still work for the transformed columns. That means linear dependence is preserved. Conversely, if after the operation the columns are dependent, then pre-multiplying by E^{-1} (since E is invertible) would take us back to the original columns, implying they were dependent originally. So the dependence relations are preserved in both directions.\n\nWait, but the problem statement mentions that when reducing to reduced row-echelon form, the columns of the original matrix corresponding to the pivot columns in the reduced form form a basis. This is because the row operations don't change the linear dependencies, so the pivot columns in the reduced matrix indicate which original columns are independent.\n\nSo, the main idea is that elementary row operations are linear transformations represented by invertible matrices. Since these transformations are invertible, they preserve the linear relationships among columns. Therefore, dependencies (and independencies) are maintained.\n\nI need to structure this into assumptions and the problem. The original question didn't state any specific assumptions beyond the general context of linear algebra. The key assumptions here are about the nature of elementary row operations and their effect on column relations. However, in the example provided, assumptions were specific like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" For this problem, the main assumption is that we're dealing with a matrix and elementary row operations, but maybe more specifically, the problem assumes that elementary row operations do not alter linear dependence between columns. But since the user is asking why that's true, the assumption might not include that. Wait, no. The user is starting from the knowledge that linear dependence is preserved and wants a proof. So perhaps the problem statement is just the question, and the assumptions are implicit in the context of linear algebra. But according to the format example, the assumptions should list conditions applied to one object each.\n\nWait, looking back at the example: the original problem stated that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. In the formatted version, the assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in the original problem, the user didn't mention n being divisible by 7. Wait, that might have been a mistake. The example might have been incorrect. Wait, let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. Formatted problem's assumptions include that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in the original problem, n is any integer, not necessarily divisible by 7. So that example might be incorrect. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Anyway, the user's instruction says that the assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. So for the current problem, the user is talking about a matrix A, reducing it to RREF J, and the columns of A corresponding to the linearly independent columns of J form a basis. The key assumptions here would be about the matrix and the operations applied. However, the problem is general, so maybe the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a matrix,\nElementary row operations are applied to A,\nJ is the reduced row echelon form of A,\nColumns of J are linearly independent if and only if corresponding columns of A are linearly independent.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to prove that linear dependence is preserved. So perhaps the assumptions are more about the properties of elementary row operations and matrices. But since the question is about why this preservation happens, the problem statement is the question, and the assumptions are the given conditions. Maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a matrix with columns c1, c2, ..., cn,\nElementary row operations are applied to A,\nLinear dependence relations are equations of the form a1c1 + ... + ancn = 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that elementary row operations preserve linear dependence between matrix columns.\n\nAlternatively, since the user's original question is \"Why do elementary row operations preserve linear dependence between matrix columns?\" the problem statement is that, and the assumptions would be the given context: that we're dealing with a matrix, elementary row operations, and linear dependence between columns. But according to the example, assumptions are specific conditions. Maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nMatrix A has columns with linear dependence relations,\nElementary row operations are applied to A.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the linear dependence between columns of A is preserved after elementary row operations.\n\nBut the example included mathematical expressions in assumptions. Hmm. Alternatively, since the problem is general, maybe there are no specific numerical assumptions, but the key objects are the matrix, the row operations, and the dependence relations. The user's example included assumptions as conditions on n, but here it's more conceptual. Maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nLet A be an m×n matrix,\nElementary row operations are applied to A,\nColumns of A are linearly dependent.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the columns of the resulting matrix after elementary row operations remain linearly dependent.\n\nBut the original problem says \"preserve linear dependence between columns\", which is about maintaining the relations, not just that dependent columns stay dependent. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nFor matrix A, there exists scalars α1, α2, ..., αn, not all zero, such that α1c1 + α2c2 + ... + αncn = 0, where ci are columns of A,\nElementary row operations are applied to A.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the same scalars α1, α2, ..., αn satisfy the linear dependence relation for the columns of the transformed matrix.\n\nBut maybe that's too specific. Alternatively, the problem is more about the preservation in both directions. The key point is that elementary row operations are invertible, so they preserve the solution set of the homogeneous system, which corresponds to linear dependence.\n\nBut to fit the format, the assumptions should list each condition. Let me try:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a matrix with columns c1, c2, ..., cn,\nThere exists scalars α1, α2, ..., αn, not all zero, such that α1c1 + α2c2 + ... + αncn = 0,\nElementary row operations are applied to A,\nThe resulting matrix after operations has columns c1', c2', ..., cn'.\n\nProblem:\nProve that α1c1' + α2c2' + ... + αncn' = 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe more general. The core idea is that applying an elementary row operation is multiplying by an invertible matrix, which preserves the linear relations. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nElementary row operations correspond to multiplication by invertible matrices,\nLinear dependence of columns is determined by the existence of non-trivial solutions to α1c1 + ... + αncn = 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that applying elementary row operations preserves the linear dependence relations between columns.\n\nBut maybe the user example didn't include such abstract assumptions. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem didn't state that n must be divisible by 7, but the formatted version included that as an assumption. That seems like an error, but perhaps the user intended to extract specific conditions from the problem. Wait, no. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumptions include \"n is divisible by 7\". That's conflicting. Maybe that was a mistake. So perhaps in this case, the user wants to structure the problem by extracting assumptions from the question. But the question here is general, not a specific numerical problem. The user's question is: \"Why do elementary row operations preserve linear dependence between matrix columns?\" So the problem is that, and the assumptions would be the context given: matrix A, elementary row operations, and linear dependence between columns. But since the example included specific mathematical conditions, maybe here we need to frame it similarly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions are the properties of elementary row operations. Let me try:\n\nAssumption:\nElementary row operations are applied to a matrix,\nThe solution set of the associated homogeneous system is preserved under these operations.\n\nProblem:\nProve that linear dependence between matrix columns is preserved by elementary row operations.\n\nBut I think the key is to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nA is an m×n matrix,\nElementary row operations are applied to A,\nColumns of A are linearly dependent.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the columns of the resulting matrix after elementary row operations remain linearly dependent.\n\nBut the question is more about preserving the relations, not just that dependent columns stay dependent. The user mentions that \"linear dependence is preserved under elementary row operations\", and they want a proof. So perhaps the assumptions should be that we have a matrix, perform elementary row ops, and that there exists a linear dependence relation. Then the problem is to show the same relation holds after ops.\n\nThus:\n\nAssumption:\nLet A be a matrix with columns c₁, c₂, ..., cₙ,\nThere exist scalars α₁, α₂, ..., αₙ, not all zero, such that α₁c₁ + α₂c₂ + ... + αₙcₙ = 0,\nAn elementary row operation is applied to A, resulting in matrix A' with columns c₁', c₂', ..., cₙ'.\n\nProblem:\nProve that α₁c₁' + α₂c₂' + ... + αₙcₙ' = 0.\n\nThis way, each assumption is a single condition on one object. Then the problem is to show the dependence relation holds post-operation. That fits the example format better, even though the example had a mistake. So I'll structure it like that.",
