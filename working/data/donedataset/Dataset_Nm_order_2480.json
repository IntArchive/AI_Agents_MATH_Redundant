    "Content": "so I stumbled upon this equation/formula, and I have no idea how to prove it. I don't know how should I approach it:\n$$\n\\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2 + \\cdots + \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{\\vphantom{\\large A}2\\,}\\,}\\,}\\,}\\\n=\\\n2\\cos\\left(\\vphantom{\\Large A}\\pi \\over 2^{n + 1}\\right)\n$$ where $n\\in\\mathbb N$ and the square root sign appears $n$-times. I thought about using sequences and limits, to express the LHS as a recurrence relation but I didn't get anywhere. edit: Solved, thanks for your answers and comments.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Hint : Use induction and the half-angle formula for cosine. Solution : For $n=1$, the claim is true, since $\\cos(\\pi/4)=\\sqrt{2}/2$. By the half-angle formula $$2\\cos(x/2)=\\sqrt{2+2\\cos(x)}$$\nTherefore\n$$\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2+\\cdots+\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2}}}}=\\sqrt{2+2\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2^n}\\right)}=2\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2^{n+1}}\\right)$$\nwhere in the left square root expressions there are $n$ square roots and in the first equality we have used the induction hypothesis that the claim holds for $n-1$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given question from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe original question is about proving an equality involving a nested square root on the left-hand side and a cosine function on the right-hand side. The title mentions the equation: \n\n√(2 + √(2 + ... + √(2 + √2))) = 2cos(π/(2^{n+1}))\n\nThe user mentions that n is a natural number and the square root appears n times. They tried using recurrence relations but didn't get anywhere, and now they've solved it but the task is to format the problem.\n\nFirst, list the assumptions. The problem states that n is a natural number, so that's one assumption. The other part is about the number of square roots being equal to n. So each assumption should be a single property applied to one object. \n\nAssumptions:\n- n is a natural number.\n- The nested square root expression contains n square root signs.\n\nThe problem is to prove that the LHS equals the RHS as given. So the problem statement is straightforward.\n\nWait, in the example provided earlier, the original problem had an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original. Wait no, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, looking back: the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem had \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, perhaps that was a mistake in the example? Because the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem in example: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. Formatted problem assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that's conflicting. The original says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted adds that n must be divisible by 7. That seems like an error. But perhaps the example was incorrect? Or maybe the user made a mistake. But in any case, I need to follow the user's instruction to structure the problem as per their example. Wait, maybe the example had a typo. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the example's original problem states: \"Prove that for every integer $n$, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that contradicts the original problem's \"for every integer n\". So perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user provided it as their own example. Therefore, perhaps when structuring, the assumptions should include all conditions, even if they're part of the problem's premise.\n\nIn the current problem, the problem states \"n ∈ ℕ\" and the square root appears n times. So the assumptions are:\n\n1. n is a natural number.\n2. The nested square root expression contains n square root signs.\n\nThe problem is to prove the equality.\n\nSo the formatted problem should list these assumptions and then the problem statement.",
