    "AcceptedAnswer": "OK, in view of what is written above, I will write down what I had in mind more carefully. Let us take the positive choice of $\\sqrt{p_i}$ in each case, so clearly the sum (and each non-empty subsum) of the square roots is non-zero. Let $E$ be as stated in the question, the Galois group of the left-hand extension. The extension is certainly a Galois extension of $\\mathbb{Q}.$ Let $\\alpha$ be an element of $E$. Then $\\alpha(\\sqrt{p_i}) = \\pm \\sqrt{p_i}$ for each $i.$ Let $I$ be the subset of $\\{i: 1 \\leq i \\leq n \\}$ such that $\\alpha$ fixes $\\sqrt{p_i}$ for each $i \\in I$, but no other $i.$\nLet $s = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\sqrt{p_i}$. Then $s- \\alpha(s) = 2\\sum_{i \\not \\in I} \\sqrt{p_i},$ which is strictly positive unless $\\alpha$ is trivial. Since $E$ is elementary Abelian (I do not think we need to know that it has order $2^n$), we know that every intermediate extension is a Galois extension. Hence $s$ lies in no intermediate extension, and must generate the whole of the left-hand extension.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about proving that two field extensions of the rationals are equal: one generated by the square roots of several distinct primes and the other generated by the sum of those square roots. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ are different prime numbers. So the first assumption is that each p_i is a prime, and they are all distinct. The problem is to show that the field generated by all these square roots individually is the same as the field generated by their sum. \n\nLooking at the example provided, each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. Here, each prime p_i is distinct. But since there are multiple primes, maybe I need to list each one? Wait, but in the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7. In this case, the primes are different, so the key assumption is that p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ are distinct primes.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- Each p_i is a prime number.\n- The primes p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ are distinct.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"different prime numbers,\" so that's two things: they are primes, and they are distinct. But maybe in the problem statement, \"different prime numbers\" is a single condition. However, to split into separate assumptions as per the example, maybe list each prime and their distinctness. Hmm, perhaps the user wants each assumption to be a single line. Let me check the example again. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. So each line is a separate condition on the same object. Here, the primes are multiple objects. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nEach p_i is a prime number for i = 1, 2, ..., n,\nThe primes p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ are distinct.\n\nBut maybe the first assumption can be phrased as \"p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ are prime numbers,\" and the second \"p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ are distinct.\" That would split into two separate lines, each addressing a different property. That seems to fit the example's style.\n\nThen the problem is to show that Q[sqrt(p₁), ..., sqrt(pₙ)] equals Q[sqrt(p₁)+...+sqrt(pₙ)]. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other assumptions. The user mentions that the Galois group is elementary abelian of order 2ⁿ, but that's part of the attempt in the original question, not part of the problem's given assumptions. So the problem itself doesn't require that as an assumption; it's part of the solution approach. So the formatted problem's assumptions should only include what's given in the problem statement, not the user's attempt. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\np₁, p₂, ..., pₙ are prime numbers,\np₁, p₂, ..., pₙ are distinct.\nProblem:\nShow that $$\\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{p_{1}}, \\sqrt{p_{2}}, \\ldots, \\sqrt{p_{n}} ] = \\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{p_{1}}+ \\sqrt{p_{2}}+\\cdots + \\sqrt{p_{n}}]$$.",
