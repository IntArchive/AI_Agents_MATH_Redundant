    "Content": "I wish to show that $$\\sum_{n = 0}^\\infty (-1)^n \\left [\\frac{2n + 1/2}{(2n + 1/2)^2 + 1} + \\frac{2n + 3/2}{(2n + 3/2)^2 + 1} \\right] = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{2}} \\frac{\\cosh \\left (\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right )}{\\cosh (\\pi)}.$$ The reason I wish to find such a sum is as follows.\nThe question here called for the evaluation (I have added its value) of $$\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\sqrt{x} \\cos (\\ln x)}{x^2 + 1} \\, dx = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{2}} \\frac{\\cosh \\left (\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right )}{\\cosh (\\pi)}.$$ As one of the comments, the OP remarked that they would like to see different approaches to the evaluation of the integral so I thought I would try my hand at one that does not rely on contour integration and the residue theorem. My approach was as follows: \\begin{align}\n\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\sqrt{x} \\cos (\\ln x)}{x^2 + 1} \\, dx &= \\int_0^1 \\frac{\\sqrt{x} \\cos (\\ln x)}{x^2 + 1} \\, dx + \\int_1^\\infty \\frac{\\sqrt{x} \\cos (\\ln x)}{x^2 + 1} \\, dx\\\\\n&= \\int_0^1 \\frac{\\cos (\\ln x) (x + 1)}{\\sqrt{x} (1 + x^2)} \\, dx,\n\\end{align} after a substitution of $x \\mapsto 1/x$ has been enforced in the second of the integrals. Now if we enforce a substitution of $x \\mapsto e^{-x}$ one arrives at $$\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\sqrt{x} \\cos (\\ln x)}{x^2 + 1} \\, dx = \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\cos x \\cosh (x/2)}{\\cosh x} \\, dx.$$ Writing the hyperbolic functions in terms of exponentials we have \\begin{align}\n\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\sqrt{x} \\cos (\\ln x)}{x^2 + 1} \\, dx &= \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\cos x (e^{-x/2} + e^{-3x/2})}{1 + e^{-2x}} \\, dx\\\\\n&= \\text{Re} \\sum_{n = 0}^\\infty (-1)^n \\int_0^\\infty \\left [e^{-(2n + 1/2 - i) x} + e^{-(2n + 3/2 - i)x} \\right ] \\, dx\\\\\n&= \\text{Re} \\sum_{n = 0}^\\infty (-1)^n \\left [\\frac{1}{2n + 1/2 - i} + \\frac{1}{2n + 3/2 - i} \\right ] \\tag1\\\\\n&= \\sum_{n = 0}^\\infty (-1)^n \\left [\\frac{2n + 1/2}{(2n + 1/2)^2 + 1} + \\frac{2n + 3/2}{(2n + 3/2)^2 + 1} \\right],\n\\end{align} which brings me to my sum. Some thoughts on finding this sum Rewriting the sum $S$ in (1) as follows: \\begin{align}\nS &= \\text{Re} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} \\sum_{n = 0}^\\infty \\left [\\frac{1}{n + 1/8 - i/4} + \\frac{1}{n + 3/8 - i/4} - \\frac{1}{n + 5/8 - i/4} - \\frac{1}{n + 7/8 - i/4} \\right ]\\\\\n&= \\text{Re} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} \\sum_{n = 0}^\\infty \\left (\\frac{1}{n + 1} - \\frac{1}{n + 7/8 - i/4} \\right ) + \\frac{1}{4} \\sum_{n = 0}^\\infty \\left (\\frac{1}{n + 1} - \\frac{1}{n + 5/8 - i/4} \\right )\\\\\n& \\qquad - \\frac{1}{4} \\sum_{n = 0}^\\infty \\left (\\frac{1}{n + 1} - \\frac{1}{n + 3/8 - i/4} \\right ) - \\frac{1}{4} \\sum_{n = 0}^\\infty \\left (\\frac{1}{n + 1} - \\frac{1}{n + 1/8 - i/4} \\right )\\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{4} \\text{Re} \\left [\\psi \\left (\\frac{7}{8} - \\frac{i}{4} \\right ) + \\psi \\left (\\frac{5}{8} - \\frac{i}{4} \\right ) - \\psi \\left (\\frac{3}{8} - \\frac{i}{4} \\right ) - \\psi \\left (\\frac{1}{8} - \\frac{i}{4} \\right ) \\right ]. \n\\end{align} Here $\\psi (z)$ is the digamma function. I was rather hoping to use the reflexion formula for the digamma function, but alas it does not seem to take me any closer to a final real solution. Final thought While it would be nice to see how to evaluate this sum, perhaps my approach was not the best so alternative methods to evaluate the integral that avoid this sum and does not rely on contour integration would also be welcome.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this Math Stack Exchange question. The user wants to show that an infinite sum equals a specific expression involving pi and hyperbolic cosine functions. They mentioned an integral evaluation as the motivation, but the core problem is the sum itself.\n\nFirst, I need to filter out the main problem from the background. The user goes into detail about how they transformed an integral into the sum, but the actual problem to solve is the sum. The integral part is context, but the key here is the sum expression they arrived at.\n\nLooking at the Problem section, the user states the sum they want to evaluate. The assumptions here might not be explicit, but in the context, they're dealing with an infinite series, so convergence is important. However, since the example given in the original instruction didn't mention convergence as an assumption unless stated, maybe here we don't need to list it unless the user specifies. But the problem itself doesn't state any conditions, so maybe the only assumption is about the sum structure.\n\nWait, the problem is to evaluate the sum as written. The user has already transformed the integral into this sum, and now they need to prove the sum equals the given pi expression. So the assumptions here would be related to the terms of the sum. Let me check:\n\nEach term in the sum has (-1)^n multiplied by two fractions. The denominators are quadratic expressions in n. The problem is to sum from n=0 to infinity. Are there any implicit assumptions here? For example, that the series converges? But the user arrived at this sum through their integral transformation, so maybe convergence is already handled. However, in the example given earlier, assumptions were about the variable (n being integer, etc.), so here, maybe n is an integer starting from 0? That's typical in sums.\n\nSo possible assumptions:\n\n- n is a non-negative integer (since the sum starts at n=0 and goes to infinity)\n- The terms of the sum are defined as given, with denominators (2n + 1/2)^2 + 1 and similar for the other term.\n\nBut the example had assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So here, the key is n is an integer (as per the sum index), and maybe the structure of each term. However, the problem statement itself includes the sum expression, so maybe the only assumption is that n runs over non-negative integers. Alternatively, if there's a specific condition needed for convergence or evaluation, but the problem as stated doesn't mention that. The original problem's integral led to this sum, so perhaps the convergence is assured via the integral's existence.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nn is an integer,\nn is greater than or equal to 0.\n\nBut in the example, the assumption was \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, the problem is to sum over n starting at 0, so n is a non-negative integer. So each assumption on its own line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn ≥ 0.\n\nProblem: Show that the sum equals the given expression.\n\nI think that's the main structure. The rest of the context (integral, digamma functions) is part of their approach but not the problem's assumptions. The problem is purely about the sum.",
