Let's assume that we have a matrix A' that is not positive definite (so at least one leading principal minor is negative). Can one prove that there is no L such as A' = LL* ?

    "AcceptedAnswer": "Suppose a matrix $A$ factors as $A = L^* L$.  Then\n\\begin{align}\nx^* Ax &= x^* L^* L x \\\\\n&= (Lx)^* (Lx) \\\\\n&= \\| Lx \\|^2 \\\\\n&\\geq 0.\n\\end{align}\nThis shows that $A$ is positive semidefinite. If we further assume that $L$ is square and triangular with positive real diagonal entries, then $L$ is invertible, so $Lx = 0 \\iff x = 0$.  In this case, we see that $A$ is positive definite.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the user's format. First, I need to read through the Math Stack Exchange question carefully and filter out the irrelevant information. The user wants the assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to a single object.\n\nThe original question is about why the Cholesky decomposition requires a positive definite matrix. The user is asking what happens if you try to factorize a non-positive definite matrix, specifically whether you can prove there's no such L, and also about the statement that LL* is always positive definite.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. So in this case, the key assumptions would relate to the properties of the matrix involved in Cholesky decomposition. \n\nFirst, the Cholesky decomposition requires the matrix to be positive definite. That's a primary assumption. Then, the user mentions a matrix A' that is not positive definite, with at least one leading principal minor negative. The question is whether there's no L such that A' = LL*. Also, the problem statement to demonstrate is that for any square matrix L, LL* is positive definite.\n\nSo the assumptions should include that A is positive definite for Cholesky, and then for the problem part, the user wants to show that LL* is always positive definite, which implies that if a matrix isn't positive definite, it can't be decomposed as LL*. \n\nI need to list each assumption separately. Let me parse the original question again. The user is asking why positive definiteness is required, what happens if you use a non-positive definite matrix, and whether you can prove no L exists for such a matrix. The problem part is the demonstration that LL* is positive definite for any square L.\n\nSo assumptions here would be:\n\n1. Matrix A is positive definite. (This is the standard assumption for Cholesky.)\n2. Matrix A' is not positive definite. (Given in the problem.)\n3. At least one leading principal minor of A' is negative. (Part of the problem's setup.)\n4. L is a square matrix. (Since we're talking about LL*.)\n\nBut wait, the problem is structured into two parts: one about decomposing A' (non-positive definite) and the other about proving LL* is positive definite. The user wants the problem restated with assumptions and the problem.\n\nSo the key assumptions here are:\n\n- A is a positive definite matrix. (For Cholesky to exist.)\n- A' is a square matrix that is not positive definite. (For the case where decomposition might fail.)\n- There exists a square matrix L such that A' = LL*. (This is part of the problem's question, but actually, the user is asking if this can be proven impossible. So maybe not an assumption but part of the problem statement.)\n\nWait, perhaps the assumptions should be the conditions given in the problem. The user is asking: Why does Cholesky require A to be positive definite? What happens if you use a non-positive definite matrix? Can you prove that there's no L such that A' = LL* if A' is not positive definite? Also, demonstrate that for any square L, LL* is positive definite.\n\nSo the problem as per the user's example should have:\n\nAssumptions:\n- A is a positive definite matrix.\n- A' is a square matrix that is not positive definite.\n- At least one leading principal minor of A' is negative.\n- L is a square matrix.\n\nProblem:\nProve that for any square matrix L, the product LL* is positive definite. Show that if A' is not positive definite, there exists no matrix L such that A' = LL*.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be structured as two separate problems. Let me check the original question again.\n\nOriginal question text:\n\n\"Why does the Cholesky factorization requires the matrix A to be positive definite? What happens when we factorize non-positive definite matrix? Let's assume that we have a matrix A' that is not positive definite (so at least one leading principal minor is negative). Can one prove that there is no L such as A' = LL* ? If not, wouldn't the positive definite criteria remove some of the matrices that could be potentially decomposed? We could also put this question in the form of a demonstration for the next statement: For any square matrix L, the product LL* is a positive definite matrix.\"\n\nSo the main problem here is to demonstrate that for any square matrix L, LL* is positive definite. That would answer why Cholesky requires positive definiteness: because LL* is always positive definite, so if A isn't, it can't be written as LL*.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- A is a positive definite matrix. (For the Cholesky decomposition to exist.)\n- L is a square matrix. (Because LL* is being considered.)\n\nThe problem part would be to prove that for any square matrix L, the product LL* is positive definite, and consequently, if a matrix A' is not positive definite, there exists no L such that A' = LL*.\n\nBut how to structure this into the required format? The example given has assumptions and the problem. So maybe the problem is to prove the statement that LL* is positive definite, with assumptions that L is square. The rest (about A') follows from that.\n\nAlternatively, since the user is also asking about the case where A' is not positive definite, maybe that's another part of the problem.\n\nBut the example only has one problem line. The user's example includes assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7, then the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nIn this case, the problem is to prove that LL* is positive definite, which would imply that if a matrix is not positive definite, it can't be written as LL*. So the main problem is to demonstrate that statement, and the assumptions would be that L is a square matrix. However, the original problem also mentions A' not being positive definite and having a negative leading minor, so perhaps those are additional assumptions.\n\nBut in the example, assumptions are about the variables in the problem. So for the Cholesky problem, the assumptions needed would be:\n\n1. A is a positive definite matrix. (Required for Cholesky decomposition.)\n2. A' is a square matrix that is not positive definite. (Given for the case where decomposition is attempted.)\n3. At least one leading principal minor of A' is negative. (Specific condition on A'.)\n4. L is a square matrix. (Because Cholesky decomposition results in a square matrix L.)\n\nBut the problem part would be: Prove that for any square matrix L, the product LL* is positive definite. Consequently, show that if A' is not positive definite, there is no such L where A' = LL*.\n\nHowever, the example's problem part is just one problem statement. Maybe the problem here is two-fold, but according to the format, the problem should be stated concisely. The user wants the problem structured as per the example, which had one problem line.\n\nThe original question has two main parts: why Cholesky requires positive definiteness and the demonstration that LL* is positive definite. But the core problem seems to be the latter: proving that LL* is positive definite for any square L. This would answer why A must be positive definite for Cholesky decomposition (because otherwise, it can't be written as LL*).\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- L is a square matrix.\n\nProblem:\nProve that for any square matrix L, the product LL* is positive definite.\n\nBut the user also mentions A' being not positive definite and leading principal minors. However, the key assumption for the problem to prove LL* is positive definite is that L is square. The rest (A' not being positive definite) is part of the context but not an assumption for the problem statement. But perhaps in the original question, the problem to be structured is two parts: showing LL* is positive definite, and that non-positive definite matrices can't be decomposed. But according to the example, the problem line is one. Maybe the problem is to prove the statement \"For any square matrix L, the product LL* is a positive definite matrix,\" which would address the core of why Cholesky requires positive definiteness.\n\nSo the final answer should have:\n\nAssumptions:\n- L is a square matrix.\n\nProblem:\nProve that for any square matrix L, the product LL* is a positive definite matrix.\n\nBut wait, the original problem also mentions the case of a matrix A' that is not positive definite. However, the key assumption for the problem to be proven (LL* is PD) is just that L is square. The rest are part of the problem's context but not assumptions for the theorem itself.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumption is that A' is not positive definite and has a negative leading minor, but I think the main problem here is to prove that LL* is PD, hence the assumption is just that L is square.\n\nI think that's correct. Because the problem is to demonstrate that LL* is PD, which requires L to be square. The other parts (about A') are consequences of that statement. So the problem as per the user's request should be structured with the assumption that L is square, and the problem is to prove LL* is PD.",
