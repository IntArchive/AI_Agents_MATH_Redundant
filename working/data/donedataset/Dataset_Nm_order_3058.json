    "Content": "Back at the university we have proven (lot of work) that if $$S(X)C(Y)+C(X)S(Y) = S(X+Y)$$ and $$C(X)C(Y)-S(X)S(Y) = C(X+Y)$$ then $S(X)$ is $\\sin(x)$ and $C(X)$ is $\\cos(x)$ (or constant $0$, meh). What is this theorem called..? Later note by someone other than the original poster: An amazingly large number of people, in posted answers and comments (some now deleted) have MISSED THE POINT .  These are not the angle addition formulas for the sine and the cosine.  In those formulas, one assumes the function are the sine and cosine and shows that these equations hold.  In this problem, it's the other way around: One assumes these equations hold and then proves, rather than assuming from the outset, that the functions are the sine and cosine.  I even rejected an edit to the original posting that would have written $\\sin$ and $\\cos$ in place of $S$ and $C$.  That would have made the question incomprehensible! Please: stop doing this. --- Michael Hardy",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Write $E(x) = C(x)+i S(x)$. Then $E(x+y)=E(x)E(y)$. This is a multiplicative variant of Cauchy's functional equation. Without further hypotheses on $S$ and $C$ it is likely that there are many solutions. If $S$ and $C$ are assumed differentiable, then $E$ satisfies $E'=E$. If moreover $E$ is not identically zero, then $E(0)=1$ and so $E=\\exp$. By Euler's formula , $S=\\sin$ and $C=\\cos$. So, one answer to your question is uniqueness of the exponential function from its differential equation .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem formatting task. First, I need to understand the original question from Math Stack Exchange. The user is asking about a theorem they studied in university where they proved that if two functions S and C satisfy the addition formulas similar to sine and cosine, then those functions must actually be sine and cosine (or zero). The key point here is that the problem is the converse of the usual angle addition formulas. Normally, we assume S and C are sine and cosine and show the identities hold. Here, they start with the identities and prove S and C must be sine and cosine.\n\nNow, the task is to structure this into the given format: listing assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition for one object, then stating the problem.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are specific. For instance, in the example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Each is a separate line, each applying to one object (n in both cases here).\n\nIn the current problem, the functions S(X) and C(Y) satisfy two functional equations. So each equation is a separate assumption. Also, the problem is to prove that S and C are sine and cosine (or zero). The original question mentions that S and C could be zero, so that's another condition. But the user also notes that the functions are not assumed to be sine and cosine from the start—so the assumptions are purely the two functional equations.\n\nWait, the problem says \"if S(X)C(Y) + C(X)S(Y) = S(X+Y) and C(X)C(Y) - S(X)S(Y) = C(X+Y), then S(X) is sin(x) and C(X) is cos(x) (or constant 0)\".\n\nSo the assumptions here are the two functional equations. Each equation is an assumption. Also, the conclusion is that S and C must be sine and cosine or zero. However, the user mentions the \"constant 0\" as a possibility, so perhaps there's an implicit assumption that the functions are not identically zero, or maybe that's part of the conclusion. Wait, in the problem statement, they say \"S(X) is sin(x) and C(X) is cos(x) (or constant 0, meh)\". So maybe the conclusion allows for the zero function as a trivial case. Therefore, the assumptions are just the two equations. But each equation involves both S and C. However, the problem states that these equations hold for all X and Y, so perhaps each equation is a separate assumption.\n\nTherefore, each of the two equations should be listed as separate assumptions. Also, the functions S and C are defined for real numbers (since they are compared to sine and cosine). So maybe there's an assumption about the domain of S and C being real numbers, but the original problem doesn't specify. The original question just uses X and Y, which are variables. But in the example, the assumption was about n being an integer, so perhaps here, the domain is assumed to be real numbers unless stated otherwise. However, the problem as stated in the question doesn't specify, so maybe we can't assume that. Alternatively, perhaps the functions S and C are from reals to reals, but that's an implicit assumption. The problem might need to make that explicit. But since the original problem doesn't mention it, maybe we shouldn't add it. Wait, the user hasn't provided that detail. So the original problem as stated by the user only provides the two functional equations. Therefore, the assumptions are the two equations, and the problem is to show that under these conditions, S and C are sine and cosine or zero.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were listed as separate lines. Each assumption is a single condition applied to one object. Here, each functional equation is a separate condition, but they apply to both S and C. However, the format requires each assumption to address only one property or condition applied to one object. Wait, maybe each equation is considered a single assumption, even though they involve multiple objects. Because the example had two assumptions about n: being integer and divisible by 7. Here, each equation is a separate assumption about the functions S and C. So I think each equation is a separate assumption. So the assumptions would be:\n\n1. For all X and Y, S(X)C(Y) + C(X)S(Y) = S(X+Y)\n2. For all X and Y, C(X)C(Y) - S(X)S(Y) = C(X+Y)\n\nThen the problem is to prove that S(X) is sin(x) and C(X) is cos(x) (or constant 0). However, in the problem statement, the user mentions \"or constant 0\", so maybe there's a trivial solution where S and C are zero. But that's part of the conclusion, not an assumption. So the problem is to show that the only solutions to those functional equations are the sine and cosine functions or the zero function.\n\nBut in the example, the assumption included that n is an integer, which is a condition on n. Here, the assumptions are the two equations. So in the formatted problem, the assumptions would be those two equations, each as a separate line. The problem is to prove that S and C must be sine and cosine (or zero).\n\nBut the original question also mentions \"or constant 0\", so perhaps that's part of the conclusion. Therefore, the problem statement should include that possibility. So putting it all together:\n\nAssumptions:\n- For all X and Y, S(X)C(Y) + C(X)S(Y) = S(X+Y)\n- For all X and Y, C(X)C(Y) - S(X)S(Y) = C(X+Y)\n\nProblem:\nProve that S(X) is sin(x) and C(X) is cos(x), or S(X) is the zero function and C(X) is the zero function.\n\nBut the original question says \"S(X) is sin(x) and C(X) is cos(x) (or constant 0, meh)\". So maybe the zero function is an alternative solution. So the problem is to show that the only solutions are the sine and cosine functions or both identically zero.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user didn't specify any initial conditions, like S(0) or C(0). Without such conditions, the zero functions would satisfy the equations. So perhaps the problem includes the possibility of zero functions unless there are additional constraints. However, the original problem as stated by the user doesn't mention any other conditions. Therefore, the problem is to show that under those two functional equations, the only solutions are sine and cosine or the zero functions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have the two equations as assumptions, and the problem is to prove that S and C must be sine/cosine or zero.\n\nWait, but in the original problem statement, the user says \"if [equations hold] then S(X) is sin(x) and C(X) is cos(x) (or constant 0, meh)\". So the \"meh\" suggests that the zero case is trivial or perhaps not considered interesting. But the problem as posed is to show that S and C must be sine and cosine or zero. However, without additional constraints like S and C being non-trivial or satisfying certain initial conditions (e.g., S(0) = 0, C(0) = 1), the zero functions would indeed be solutions.\n\nTherefore, the problem as posed by the user includes the zero functions as possible solutions. Hence, the formatted problem should reflect that the conclusion allows for S and C to be zero functions. So the problem statement would be to prove that under the given functional equations, S and C must be either sine and cosine or both zero.\n\nNow, checking the example again. In the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Each on separate lines. Here, the two equations are the assumptions. Each equation is a separate line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nFor all X and Y, S(X)C(Y) + C(X)S(Y) = S(X+Y),\nFor all X and Y, C(X)C(Y) - S(X)S(Y) = C(X+Y).\n\nProblem:\nProve that S(X) is sin(x) and C(X) is cos(x), or S(X) and C(X) are the zero functions.\n\nBut the original question uses \"C(X)\" and \"S(X)\", not \"cos(x)\" and \"sin(x)\", so in the problem statement, we should state that S and C are those functions. Wait, the problem is to prove that S and C must be sine and cosine or zero. So the problem statement should be:\n\nProve that S(X) is equal to sin(x) and C(X) is equal to cos(x), or S(X) and C(X) are the zero function.\n\nBut perhaps the original problem allows for one of them to be zero and the other non-zero? Let me check the equations. If S is zero and C is arbitrary, then substituting into the first equation: 0*C(Y) + C(X)*0 = 0 = S(X+Y). So S must be zero. Then the second equation becomes C(X)C(Y) - 0 = C(X+Y), so C must satisfy C(X+Y) = C(X)C(Y). The solutions to this are exponential functions, but if we also have that C is bounded (as sine and cosine are), then C must be cosine if we assume continuity, etc. But the problem as stated doesn't include boundedness or continuity. Wait, but the original proof done by the user at university probably required some additional conditions. However, the user hasn't mentioned any. Therefore, perhaps the problem as stated only reaches the conclusion that S and C are sine and cosine or zero under the given functional equations, but maybe there are more solutions unless other conditions are imposed. But the user says they proved that S and C must be sine and cosine or zero, implying that those are the only solutions under the given assumptions.\n\nBut perhaps the original proof required some regularity conditions, like the functions being continuous or differentiable. However, the user hasn't mentioned those. Therefore, the problem as posed by the user includes only the two functional equations as assumptions, and the conclusion is that S and C must be sine and cosine or zero. Therefore, the formatted problem should list the two equations as assumptions and the problem is to prove that S and C are sine/cosine or zero.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nFor all X and Y, S(X)C(Y) + C(X)S(Y) = S(X+Y),\nFor all X and Y, C(X)C(Y) - S(X)S(Y) = C(X+Y).\nProblem:\nProve that S(X) is equal to sin(x) and C(X) is equal to cos(x), or S(X) and C(X) are the zero functions.\n###",
