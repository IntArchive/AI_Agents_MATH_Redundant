    "Content": "While on AOPS, I saw this interesting problem. I was wondering how many different approaches could be used to tackle the problem. In other words I am looking for interesting and unique ways to solve the question: Show geometrically that $\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3}>\\pi$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The following method is elementary, but perhaps not very elegant. ( Hopefully others will find a more beautiful solution. ) ( NB : Each of the figures can be clicked on to display a larger version.) Before we begin, first note that the absolute relative error of $\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}$ with respect to $\\pi$ is quite small. Indeed,\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3} - \\pi}{\\pi}\\right| < 0.0015 = 0.15\\% \\,,\n$$\nso it would seem that any geometric construction would have to be pretty precise. Our solution is formed by constructing 16 adjacent (nonoverlapping) right triangles. Eight of these triangles have area $\\sqrt{2}/64$ each and the other eight triangles are of area $\\sqrt{3}/64$. The construction is done in such a way that, collectively, they are larger than 1/8 of a unit circle. Below is the final picture followed by a discussion. Final result The triangles in blue are each of area $\\sqrt{2}/64$ and each green one has area $\\sqrt{3}/64$. The dotted line is the forty-five degree line, so that the portion of the circle between it and the $x$-axis is one-eighth of the whole and so has area $\\pi/8$. The right panel is a zoomed in version of the left panel. The small grey square on the forty-five degree in the left panel shows the \"zoom\" box that corresponds to the entire figure in the right panel. Constructing tangent lines of length $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$ To construct the necessary triangles, we need to be able to construct tangent lines to the unit circle of length $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$, respectively. Below is one such construction of a line segment of length $\\sqrt{2}$. Here is a construction of a line segment of length $\\sqrt{3}$. Note that once we have a line segment of length $L$, it is straightforward to subdivide it to create segments of length $2^{-n} L$ for any nonnegative integer $n$. Example construction of paired right triangles We form the right triangles in reflected pairs so that they always dominate the corresponding segment of the circle. Here is an example of a construction using a side length of $\\sqrt{2}/4$ tangent to the unit circle. The two triangles put together obviously have area $\\sqrt{2}/4$ in this example. Final construction To get the final construction, we use side lengths of $\\sqrt{2}/32$ and $\\sqrt{3}/32$, respectively. Constructing four adjacent pairs each of such triangles, we can strictly dominate one-eighth of a circle, hence\n$$\n\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{8} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{8} > \\frac{\\pi}{8}\n$$\nwhich is clearly equivalent to the desired inequality.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants to show geometrically that √2 + √3 is greater than π. Hmm, so we need to use some geometric constructions or interpretations to compare these numbers without just calculating their decimal approximations. \n\nFirst, I know that √2 is approximately 1.414 and √3 is about 1.732, so adding them gives around 3.146. Pi is approximately 3.1416, so numerically it's close, but we need a geometric proof. \n\nMaybe we can relate these square roots to lengths in certain shapes and then compare those shapes to a circle, since π is involved. Let me think. For example, √2 is the diagonal of a unit square, and √3 is the diagonal of a rectangular prism with sides 1, 1, and 1? Wait, no, √3 is the space diagonal of a unit cube. But maybe there's a way to use more planar geometry. \n\nAlternatively, consider a circle with circumference π. The circumference is 2πr, so if we take r = 0.5, the circumference is π. Then, perhaps constructing a polygon or a path whose total length is √2 + √3 and showing that it's longer than the circumference of the circle. But how?\n\nWait, maybe using a unit circle. The circumference would be 2π. But we need to compare √2 + √3 to π. If we can create a path inside or outside the circle that's longer than the circle's semi-circumference or something. Let me see. If we take a quarter circle with radius 1, the length is π/2. But maybe that's not directly helpful.\n\nAnother approach: use geometric figures whose perimeters or diagonals relate to √2 and √3. For instance, a square with side length 1 has a diagonal of √2, and an equilateral triangle with side length 2 has a height of √3. Maybe combining these shapes around a circle to compare lengths.\n\nAlternatively, inscribe and circumscribe polygons around a circle. The perimeter of inscribed polygons is less than the circumference, and circumscribed ones are greater. For example, the perimeter of an inscribed hexagon is 6, and the circumference is 2π (~6.283), so 6 < 2π. But how does this relate to √2 + √3?\n\nWait, maybe using a square and an equilateral triangle. If we inscribe a square in a circle of radius 1, the diagonal of the square is 2 (diameter), so the side length is √2. The perimeter of the square is 4√2 ≈ 5.656. The circumference of the circle is 2π ≈ 6.283, so the square's perimeter is less. But that's not helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, consider a circle with diameter √2 + √3 and show that its circumference is greater than π*(√2 + √3). Wait, that might not make sense. Let me think differently.\n\nPerhaps constructing a polygon whose side lengths sum to √2 + √3 and show that it encloses a circle with circumference π. For example, if we have a rectangle with sides a and b, then the perimeter is 2(a + b). If we set a + b = (√2 + √3)/2, then the perimeter is √2 + √3. But how does this compare to a circle with circumference π?\n\nWait, maybe using the isoperimetric inequality, which relates the perimeter of a shape to its area. The circle maximizes the area for a given perimeter. But we need to compare perimeters. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, create a shape with perimeter √2 + √3 and compare it to a circle with circumference π. If the perimeter is longer, then the circle with circumference π must have a smaller radius. Let me see. Suppose we have a circle with circumference π. Its radius is π/(2π) = 0.5. The area would be π*(0.5)^2 = π/4 ≈ 0.785. Now, if we have a square with perimeter √2 + √3, each side would be (√2 + √3)/4 ≈ (1.414 + 1.732)/4 ≈ 3.146/4 ≈ 0.7865. The area of the square would be (0.7865)^2 ≈ 0.618, which is less than the circle's area. But the isoperimetric inequality states that for a given perimeter, the circle has the largest area. So if the square has a smaller area than the circle, then the perimeter of the square must be less than the circumference of the circle? Wait, no. The isoperimetric inequality says that for a given perimeter, the circle has the maximum area. So if two shapes have the same perimeter, the circle has the largest area. Conversely, if two shapes have the same area, the circle has the smallest perimeter. But here, the square has a smaller area but a longer perimeter than the circle? Wait, in this case, the square's perimeter is √2 + √3 ≈ 3.146, and the circle's circumference is π ≈ 3.1416. So the square's perimeter is slightly longer. Then, since the square's perimeter is longer than the circle's circumference, and the square's area is smaller, that fits with the isoperimetric inequality: the circle has a larger area for a smaller perimeter. But how does this help us prove that √2 + √3 > π?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the fact that the shortest path between two points is a straight line. If we can construct a path composed of √2 and √3 segments that approximates a semicircle or some portion of a circle's circumference, then the straight line path would be shorter than the curved one. But I need to think of a specific construction.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Consider a right triangle where the legs are 1 and 1, so the hypotenuse is √2. Then another right triangle with legs 1 and √2, hypotenuse √3. Combining these, maybe creating a polygonal path that approximates a quarter-circle. Let me try to visualize this.\n\nImagine a unit circle. The quarter-circle from (0,0) to (1,1) has length π/2 ≈ 1.5708. If we instead go from (0,0) to (1,0) to (1,1), that's a path of length 2. But that's longer than the quarter-circle. Alternatively, the diagonal from (0,0) to (1,1) is √2 ≈ 1.414, which is shorter than π/2. Hmm, that's the opposite of what we need.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a polygon inscribed in a circle. For example, a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle of radius 1 has side length 1, perimeter 6. The circumference is 2π ≈ 6.283. So the hexagon's perimeter is less than the circumference. But how does √2 + √3 come into play?\n\nWait, √2 + √3 ≈ 3.146. If we compare that to π ≈ 3.1416, it's slightly larger. So maybe constructing a polygon with perimeter √2 + √3 that's circumscribed around a circle with circumference π. If the perimeter is longer, then the circle's circumference must be less. But how to relate them geometrically.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that π is the limit of the perimeter of regular polygons as the number of sides increases. Maybe using a specific polygon with a perimeter related to √2 + √3.\n\nAnother approach: consider a circle with diameter 1, so circumference π. Then, construct two line segments whose lengths are √2 and √3, and show that their sum is longer than the circumference.\n\nBut √2 + √3 ≈ 3.146, and π ≈ 3.1416, so their sum is indeed longer. But geometrically, how can we show that the sum of these two diagonals is longer than the circumference of the circle.\n\nPerhaps superimpose the line segments on the circle. For example, if we have a circle of radius 1, the circumference is 2π ≈ 6.283. But we need to compare to √2 + √3 ≈ 3.146, which is about half of that. Maybe using a semicircle?\n\nWait, a semicircle of radius 1 has length π ≈ 3.1416. So if we can construct a path from one end of the diameter to the other that is longer than the semicircle, that would show that √2 + √3 > π. How?\n\nImagine the diameter of the circle is from point A to point B, length 2. The semicircle from A to B has length π. Now, if we can find a path from A to B that goes through some points outside the circle and has total length √2 + √3, that would do it. But how?\n\nAlternatively, consider points inside the circle. For example, construct a polygon path from A to B with two segments: one of length √2 and another of length √3. But how to ensure that this path is longer than the semicircle.\n\nAlternatively, use triangles. Suppose we have a right triangle with legs 1 and 1, hypotenuse √2. Then another right triangle with legs 1 and √2, hypotenuse √3. If we arrange these triangles such that their hypotenuses form a path from A to B around the circle, maybe the total path length is √2 + √3, which is longer than the semicircle's π.\n\nBut I need to make this precise. Let's try to model this.\n\nTake a circle with diameter AB = 2 (radius 1). The semicircle from A to B has length π. Now, let's construct a path from A to B that goes through point C outside the circle. The path would be A to C to B. If AC + CB = √2 + √3, and we can show that this path is longer than the semicircle, then we're done. But how to position point C.\n\nAlternatively, use coordinates. Let A be (-1, 0) and B be (1, 0). The semicircle is the upper half. Suppose we take a point C somewhere above the circle. If we can find coordinates for C such that AC = √2 and CB = √3, then the total path length is √2 + √3. Then we need to show that such a point C exists outside the circle, meaning that the path A-C-B is longer than the semicircle.\n\nWait, if point C is on the circle, then AC + CB would be equal to the length of two chords. But we need C to be outside so that AC + CB is longer than the arc length. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the triangle inequality. For any two points, the straight line is the shortest path. But here we are comparing a curved path (semicircle) to a polygonal path. Hmm.\n\nWait, another idea: approximate the semicircle with two line segments whose total length is more than π. If we can show that even two segments can sum to more than π, that would help. But how does this relate to √2 + √3.\n\nAlternatively, use a geometric figure where √2 and √3 are part of the construction. For example, construct a rectangle with sides √2 and √3, then its diagonal would be √( (√2)^2 + (√3)^2 ) = √(2 + 3) = √5 ≈ 2.236, but that's not directly helpful.\n\nWait, going back to the coordinate system. Let’s place point A at (-1, 0) and B at (1, 0). The semicircle is the upper half. Let’s consider a point C at (0, y). Then the distance AC is √(1^2 + y^2) and CB is √(1^2 + y^2). So total path length is 2√(1 + y^2). If we set this equal to √2 + √3, then 2√(1 + y^2) = √2 + √3. Solving for y, we get √(1 + y^2) = (√2 + √3)/2 ≈ 3.146/2 ≈ 1.573. Then 1 + y^2 ≈ (1.573)^2 ≈ 2.473, so y^2 ≈ 1.473, y ≈ 1.214. But the circle has radius 1, so point C is outside the circle. Therefore, the path A-C-B goes outside the circle and has length √2 + √3 ≈ 3.146, which is longer than the semicircle's π ≈ 3.1416. Therefore, this construction shows that the polygonal path is longer than the semicircular path, hence √2 + √3 > π.\n\nYes, that seems to work. By constructing a point C outside the circle such that AC + CB = √2 + √3, we can visualize that this path is longer than the semicircle from A to B, which has length π. Therefore, geometrically, √2 + √3 > π.\n\nAnother way: consider that the shortest path between A and B staying within the circle is the semicircle. But if we take a path that goes outside the circle, like the two segments AC and CB, then it must be longer. Since we found such a path with length √2 + √3, which is longer, this shows the inequality.\n\nTo make this rigorous, we'd need to ensure that such a point C exists and that the construction is valid. But the key idea is that by constructing a path outside the circle with the given lengths, we can compare it to the circumference of the circle.",
