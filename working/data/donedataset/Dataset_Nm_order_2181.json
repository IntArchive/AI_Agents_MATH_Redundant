    "Content": "I know that it must be an old question, and I have encountered it before, in MAT 1993.2 (Oxford admission test). But I dimly remember the solution.\nThe question is Twenty-three people, each with integral weight, decide to play football, separating into two teams of 11 people each, plus a referee. To keep things fair, the teams chosen must have equal total weight. It turns out that no matter who is chosen to be the referee, this can always be done. Prove that the 23 people have the same weight.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The answers above rely mostly on the fact that the weights are integers. However, the result also holds for real weights as well, and is a common (spectacular regardless, in my opinion) application of linear algebra. Let $W$ be the column vector of weights. Consider the matrix $A$ ( $23 \\times 23$ with entries in $\\{0,1,-1\\}$ ) such that its $i$ th row represents the weight distribution of the teams ( $1$ for a team, $-1$ for the other and $A_{i,i}=0$ is the only null entry) when person $i$ is a referee. Then $AW=0$ , so $A$ has rank at most $22$ (unless $W=0$ ). Besides, in $\\mathbb{F}_2$ , $A$ reduces to $A’$ which has only $1$ outside the diagonal and $0$ in the diagonal. We can check that the cofactor $(1,1)$ of $A’$ is nonzero in $\\mathbb{F}_2$ , so $A$ has a nonzero cofactor, so its rank is exactly $22$ . Now, $W$ and $(1,1,\\ldots,1)$ are in the kernel of $A$ . Thus they are proportional, which is the required claim.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. So there are 23 people, each with an integer weight. They split into two teams of 11 each plus a referee. The key condition is that no matter who is chosen as referee, the remaining 22 can be divided into two teams of equal total weight. The conclusion is that all 23 people must have the same weight. \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions properly. The problem states:\n\n1. There are 23 people.\n2. Each person has an integral weight.\n3. For any choice of referee (so any one of the 23), the remaining 22 people can be partitioned into two teams of 11 each with equal total weight.\n\nThe problem is to prove that all 23 people have the same weight.\n\nWait, but in the example given in the user's instruction, the assumptions were split into separate lines, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So let's break it down.\n\nAssumptions:\n- There are 23 people.\n- Each person has an integer weight.\n- For any choice of referee, the remaining 22 people can be partitioned into two teams of 11 with equal total weight.\n\nBut the example given by the user had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. Here, the key conditions are the integral weights and the partitioning condition for any referee. So each of these should be separate.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n- There are 23 people.\n- Each person's weight is an integer.\n- For any person chosen as referee, the remaining 22 people can be divided into two teams of 11 people each with equal total weight.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that all 23 people have the same weight.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is a single line addressing one property. Let me check again. The integral weight is one property applied to each person. The condition about the referee and teams applies to any choice of referee, so that's another condition. The problem is to show all weights are equal. That seems correct.",
