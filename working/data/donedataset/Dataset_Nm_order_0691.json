    "Content": "I found this exercise in Artin. It asks me to prove that $\\det A= \\det A^T$ where $A^T$ is the transpose of the matrix $A$ . Can anyone please comment whether my proof is correct or not? Attempted solution: If $\\det A=0$ , the $A$ is non-invertible. We know that a matrix is invertible iff $A^T$ is invertible. As $A$ is non-invertible, so is $A^T$ and therefore $\\det A^T=0$ . If the matrix is invertible, then $A=E_rE_{r-1}\\dots E_1$ for a finite sequence of elementary row operations, $E_i$ . Using the fact that $(AB)^T=B^TA^T$ and using induction, we infer that $A^T=E_1^TE_2^T\\dots E_r^T$ . So, $\\det A^T=\\det (E_1^T)\\det(E_2^T)\\dots \\det(E_r^T)$ .As $E_i^T$ is an elementary row-operation as well of the same kind, $\\det E_i^T=\\det E_i$ . Using that, $\\det A^T=\\det (E_1E_2\\dots E_r)=\\det A$ .",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "While your proof is basically correct, I would not consider it my favourite proof of this fact, for the following reasons: It uses the multiplicativity of determinants, which is a much less elementary property than invariance under transposition. It works only for matrices over a field, while the definition of the determinant, and the invariance under transposition, require no more than a commutative ring. There is a general principle that identities of this kind, if they hold over fields, must in fact be valid over commutative rings as well, but understanding that kind of argument requires an additional level of mathematical maturity; it is in most cases (like this one) much easier to just give a proof that is itself valid in the more general setting. It needs to single out the non-invertible case. If you would allow for a triangular matrix (for which the result is obvious) at the end of the product of elementary operations, you would not need to single out this case (and as a bonus you would in most cases need far fewer elementary operations). See this answer to a similar question where the use of row operations was imposed (but the answer does not say what kind of matrix one is reducing to). How I would prove this depends on the definition of the determinant has been given. If it is defined using the Leibniz formula (which in my opinion is the right definition to give, although a different motivation should first be given), then the proof just amounts to showing that every permutation has the same sign as its inverse, which is quite elementary (and can by the way be done in a similar way as your proof, but using a decomposition into transpositions). If on the other hand one has defined the determinant as unique $n$-linear alternating function on an $n$ dimensional vector space taking value $1$ on a given ordered basis, (which still requires using Leibniz or a substitute for proving existence) then invariance under transposition is harder to see. Here one needs to pass to the dual vector space, but it seems necessary to use the fact that if $v_1,\\ldots,v_n$ are vectors and $\\alpha_1,\\ldots,\\alpha_n$ are linear forms, then the determinant\n$$\n\\begin{vmatrix}\\alpha_1(v_1)&\\ldots&\\alpha_1(v_n)\\\\\n\\vdots&\\ddots&\\vdots\\\\\\alpha_n(v_1)&\\ldots&\\alpha_n(v_n)\\end{vmatrix}\n$$\nis not only $n$-linear and alternating in $v_1,\\ldots,v_n$ for fixed $\\alpha_1,\\ldots,\\alpha_n$ (as is clear from the definition) but also $n$-linear and alternating in $\\alpha_1,\\ldots,\\alpha_n$ (for fixed $v_1,\\ldots,v_n$); I can see no easy argument for this, other than using the Leibniz formula. Once this is established, it is easy to show that a linear operator $f$ induces the same scalar factor on $n$-linear forms when applied to $n$-uplets of vectors as it does when applied (on the right) to $n$-uplets of linear forms, in other words its determinant is the same as that of its transpose (in essence, both cases correspond to inserting an $f$ between each $\\alpha_i$ and $v_j$ in the above determinant). This still does not provide a context in which using row operations to prove this fact would be a natural choice. It is not clear to me from the question whether Artin actually suggests this, and if so why. The only reason I can think of using such an argument is when somebody commands thou shall not use the Leibniz formula .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original question is about proving that the determinant of a matrix A is equal to the determinant of its transpose A^T. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions from the problem. The example provided shows that assumptions should list each property or condition applied to one object. Looking at the problem, the key elements are:\n\n- The matrix A is considered. \n- The transpose of A, denoted A^T, is involved.\n- The determinant function det is applied to both A and A^T.\n\nThe problem doesn't explicitly state any restrictions on the matrix A, like its size or whether it's square. But since determinants are only defined for square matrices, that's an implicit assumption. Also, the user's attempted solution mentions invertibility, which again implies that A is a square matrix. So I need to list that A is a square matrix as an assumption. Additionally, since the determinant properties apply to square matrices, this is necessary.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the problem is general for any square matrix, so there's no specific conditions on A beyond being square. The example given in the original problem included assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the main assumption is that A is a square matrix. But maybe the user's attempted solution breaks it into cases where A is invertible or not. However, according to the problem statement itself, it's a general proof, so maybe the only assumption needed is that A is a square matrix. Wait, but the example from the user included specific conditions, but in this case, the problem is general. However, in the example, the user had an extra assumption (n divisible by 7), but here, the problem is to prove det A = det A^T for any square matrix A. So the assumption is simply that A is a square matrix. \n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem had an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like a mistake. Wait, looking back: the original example problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example was structured to show that the user made a mistake, but in reality, the original problem didn't have that assumption. Wait, the user's example might have been part of the instruction. Hmm, perhaps the example was part of the user's own previous structuring, which might have included an incorrect assumption. But in the current problem, we have to correctly extract assumptions. \n\nWait, perhaps in the example, the user's formatted problem incorrectly added an assumption (n divisible by 7), but the original problem didn't have that. So maybe that example was a demonstration of how to structure, but perhaps with an error. However, for the current task, I need to correctly extract the assumptions. \n\nBack to the current problem: proving det A = det A^T. The problem as stated in the question doesn't mention any specific conditions on A other than it being a matrix for which the determinant is defined. Therefore, the key assumption is that A is a square matrix. Since determinants are only defined for square matrices, that's an implicit assumption. So the assumption here is that A is a square matrix. \n\nNow, the problem statement is to prove that det A = det A^T. The user's attempted solution considers two cases: when det A is zero (A non-invertible) and when A is invertible (det A ≠ 0). The proof uses properties of invertible matrices and elementary matrices. However, the problem itself doesn't add any extra conditions beyond A being square. So the only assumption needed is that A is a square matrix. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption: \nA is a square matrix.\n\nProblem: \nProve that $\\det A = \\det A^T$.\n\nBut wait, the example given in the user's instruction included two assumptions, even though the original problem might have had one. Wait, in the example, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem includes \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like the user might have made a mistake in the example, perhaps. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. That would actually change the problem. But maybe that example was part of a different scenario. Anyway, for the current problem, we need to follow the instructions: list all assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. \n\nIn the current problem, the only assumption needed is that A is a square matrix. There's no other condition mentioned. Therefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption: \nA is a square matrix.\n\nProblem: \nProve that $\\det A = \\det A^T$.\n\nBut wait, the user's attempted solution also uses the fact that if A is invertible, it can be expressed as a product of elementary matrices. However, that's part of the proof, not an assumption of the problem. The problem itself is general for any square matrix, so the only assumption is that A is square. Therefore, the answer should be as above.",
