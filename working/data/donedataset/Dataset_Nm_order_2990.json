    "Content": "Proof that the function $\\cot(\\pi z)$ is uniformly bounded on the\n   sides of the square with vertices $\\pm(N+1/2)\\pm i(N+1/2),n∈ℕ$. My idea was that since those squares are compact and this function is continuous on those squares the image must be compact and therefore bounded. But I'm not sure what to do with the \"uniform\" notion.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Uniformly bounded just means that the bound doesn't depend on $N$. First note that $$ |\\cot \\pi z|^{2} = \\Big|\\frac{\\cos \\pi z}{\\sin \\pi z} \\Big|^{2}$$ $$ = \\Big| \\frac{\\cos \\pi z \\cosh \\pi y -i \\sin \\pi x \\sinh \\pi y}{\\sin \\pi x \\cosh \\pi y + i \\cos \\pi x \\sinh \\pi y }\\Big|^{2}$$ $$ =\\frac{\\cos^{2} \\pi x \\cosh^{2} \\pi y +\\sin^{2} \\pi x \\sinh^{2} \\pi y}{\\sin^{2} \\pi x \\cosh^{2} \\pi y + \\cos^{2} \\pi x \\sinh^{2} \\pi y }$$ $$ = \\frac{\\cos^{2} \\pi(1+ \\sinh^{2} \\pi y) + \\sin^{2} \\pi x \\sinh^{2} \\pi y}{\\sin^{2} \\pi x(1+\\sinh^{2} \\pi y) + \\cos^{2} \\pi x \\sinh^{2} \\pi y} $$ $$ = \\frac{\\cos^{2} \\pi x + \\sinh^{2} \\pi y}{\\sin^{2} \\pi x +\\sinh^{2} \\pi y}$$ Next note that $\\cos^{2}\\Big( \\pi (N+\\frac{1}{2}) \\Big) = 0$ and $\\sin^{2} \\Big( \\pi (N+ \\frac{1}{2}) \\Big) =1$. So on the vertical sides of the square (where $x = N + \\frac{1}{2}$ or $x = - N -\\frac{1}{2}$), $$ |\\cot \\pi z|^{2} =\\frac{\\sinh^{2} \\pi y}{1+ \\sinh^{2} \\pi y} = \\frac{\\sinh^{2} \\pi y}{\\cosh^{2} \\pi y} = \\tanh^{2} \\pi y $$ $$ \\implies |\\cot \\pi z| \\le |\\tanh \\pi y| \\le 1 $$ And on the horizontal sides of the square (where $y = N + \\frac{1}{2}$ or $y = -N - \\frac{1}{2}$), $$ |\\cot \\pi z|^{2} \\le  \\frac{1 + \\sinh^{2} \\pi y}{\\sin^{2} \\pi x + \\sinh^{2}\\pi y} $$ $$ = \\frac{\\cosh^{2} \\pi y}{\\sin^{2} \\pi x + \\sinh^{2} \\pi y} \\le \\frac{\\cosh^{2}\\pi y}{\\sinh^{2} \\pi y}= \\coth^{2} \\pi y$$ $$ \\implies |\\cot \\pi z| \\le |\\coth \\pi y| \\le \\coth \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\approx 1.09$$ Thus $|\\cot \\pi z|$ is bounded by $\\coth \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ on the sides the square, which implies that $\\cot \\pi z$ is uniformly bounded on the sides of the square.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement from the original question.\n\nThe original title is: \"Proof that the function $\\cot(\\pi z)$ is uniformly bounded on the sides of the square with vertices $\\pm(N+1/2)\\pm i(N+1/2), n∈ℕ$.\" The question mentions that the squares are compact and the function is continuous, hence the image should be compact and bounded. However, the user is unsure about the \"uniform\" boundedness aspect.\n\nSo, the goal is to restate this with clear assumptions and the problem. Let's parse the key elements:\n\n1. The function in question is $\\cot(\\pi z)$.\n2. The squares have vertices at $\\pm(N+1/2) \\pm i(N+1/2)$.\n3. $N$ is a natural number (n∈ℕ).\n4. The problem is about proving uniform boundedness on the sides of these squares.\n\nAssumptions should be one per line, each addressing a single property or condition applied to one object. \n\nFirst, the vertices are defined as ±(N + 1/2) ± i(N + 1/2). So the square's sides are between these vertices. The square is centered at the origin, with each side at a distance of N + 1/2 from the center along the real and imaginary axes. \n\nNext, N is a natural number. That's an assumption about N. \n\nThe function is cot(πz), which is continuous on the squares except at poles where sin(πz) = 0, i.e., at integers. The squares in question have vertices at half-integers (since N + 1/2 is a half-integer when N is natural), so the squares avoid the integers where the poles are. Therefore, cot(πz) is continuous on these squares. But the user already considered compactness and continuity implying boundedness on each square. However, uniform boundedness would mean that the bound is independent of N. That's the key point here. \n\nSo the problem is to show that cot(πz) is uniformly bounded on the sides of all such squares, regardless of N. The current approach using compactness gives a bound that might depend on N, but uniform boundedness requires a single bound that works for all N. \n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- The squares have vertices at ±(N + 1/2) ± i(N + 1/2).\n- N is a natural number.\n- The function cot(πz) is considered on the sides of these squares.\n\nThe problem is to prove that cot(πz) is uniformly bounded on these sides. \n\nWait, but in the example given by the user, they sometimes included conditions from the problem even if they weren't explicitly stated. For example, in the original problem, the example included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the problem's context. Here, the original problem mentions that N is a natural number, so that's an assumption. The vertices are given, so that's another. The function is cot(πz), applied to the sides of the squares. \n\nSo, breaking down the assumptions:\n\n1. The function is cot(π z).\n2. The squares have vertices at ±(N + 1/2) ± i(N + 1/2).\n3. N is a natural number.\n4. The problem considers the sides of these squares.\n\nBut perhaps more precisely, each assumption should be a single condition. The vertices are defined as ±(N + 1/2) ± i(N + 1/2). So that's one assumption. N is a natural number—another. The function is cot(πz) on the sides of the squares. Wait, maybe split the vertex definition and the fact that the squares are considered for each N. But the problem is to structure the problem, not solve it, so maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n- The vertices of the square are ±(N + 1/2) ± i(N + 1/2).\n- N is a natural number.\n- The function cot(π z) is considered on the sides of the square.\n\nBut perhaps even more precise. Each assumption line should address one property of one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- The square has vertices at (N + 1/2)(±1 ± i).\n- N is a natural number.\n- The function cot(π z) is evaluated on the sides of the square.\n\nBut maybe \"The square is centered at the origin with vertices at ±(N + 1/2) ± i(N + 1/2)\" as another assumption. However, the problem states that the square has those vertices, so the exact positions are part of the problem setup.\n\nSo in the formatted problem, the assumptions would list:\n\n- The square has vertices at ±(N + 1/2) ± i(N + 1/2).\n- N is a natural number.\n- The function cot(π z) is considered on the sides of the square.\n\nBut the original problem mentions \"uniformly bounded on the sides of the square with vertices...\", so the squares vary with N, and the uniform bound should apply across all N. So the problem is to show that there exists a constant C such that for all natural numbers N and for all z on the sides of the corresponding square, |cot(π z)| ≤ C.\n\nTherefore, the problem statement is to prove that cot(π z) is uniformly bounded on the sides of these squares, i.e., the bound is independent of N.\n\nPutting this all together, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The square has vertices at ±(N + 1/2) ± i(N + 1/2).\n- N is a natural number.\n- The function cot(π z) is considered on the sides of the square.\n\nProblem: Prove that cot(π z) is uniformly bounded on the sides of the square.\n\nWait, but in the example, they had two assumptions for the original problem: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, perhaps the vertices are one assumption, N being natural is another, and maybe another assumption that the function is considered on the sides. But each assumption line should address one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- The vertices of the square are ±(N + 1/2) ± i(N + 1/2).\n- N is a natural number.\n- The function cot(π z) is evaluated on the sides of the square.\n\nProblem: Prove that cot(π z) is uniformly bounded on the sides of these squares.\n\nAlternatively, the square's definition could be split into real and imaginary parts, but that's complicating. The key is each assumption is a single condition. The first line defines the square's vertices, the second that N is natural, the third that we look at the sides. Wait, but maybe \"the sides of the square\" is part of the problem statement. Hmm, the problem is about the sides, so maybe in the problem statement, not the assumption. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. The assumptions were n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they split into two assumptions: n is integer, and n is divisible by 7. Then the problem is to prove divisibility by 91.\n\nIn the current case, the original problem states that the squares have vertices ±(N +1/2) ±i(N +1/2), N∈ℕ. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- The square has vertices at ±(N +1/2) ±i(N +1/2).\n- N is a natural number.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that cot(π z) is uniformly bounded on the sides of the square.\n\nBut the user's example included splitting the assumptions into separate lines. So here, the first assumption is the vertices, second that N is natural. Then the problem is to prove uniform boundedness on the sides.\n\nBut maybe another assumption: the function is considered on the sides of the square. But perhaps that's part of the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is to prove uniform boundedness on the sides of the square (which are defined by the vertices). So the problem includes the sides as part of the structure.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The square has vertices at ±(N + 1/2) ± i(N + 1/2).\n- N is a natural number.\n\nProblem: Prove that the function cot(π z) is uniformly bounded on the sides of the square.\n\nBut in the original question, the user mentions that the squares are compact and the function is continuous, hence bounded. But the issue is uniform boundedness across all N. So the problem is about uniform boundedness, not just boundedness for each N.\n\nHence, the key is to structure the problem with the correct assumptions and problem statement.",
