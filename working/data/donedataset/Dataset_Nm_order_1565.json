    "Content": "There are several introductory textbooks which define a ring without any reference to a unity. However, nearly all of the rings one encounters in various branches of mathematics are endowed with a $1$.\nThus, I'm wondering if some of you could prove me wrong and show me some examples of rings without unity arising naturally in a mathematical theory. (Two-sided ideals don't count as an example, because normally, they aren't considered as rings in their own right, but as modules or equivalence classes, allowing you to pass to a quotient ring (with $1$).)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I once thought it was the case that in number theory basically all the relevant rings were commutative with identity. But this is not so! In the theory of automorphic forms and representations, the Hecke algebras which act on representations of various groups (the groups of points of reductive groups over local and global fields, valued in the field, or in the global case, in its completions or its adele ring) are generally non-commutative and do not have multiplicative identities (although there are interesting subalgebras, e.g. the spherical Hecke algebras, which are commutative and do have identities). In the local case, the rings are convolution algebras of locally profinite (meaning totally disconnected and locally compact) groups. Specifically, for $G$ locally profinite, the space $C_c^\\infty(G)$ of smooth (meaning locally constant) and compactly supported complex-valued functions is a ring under convolution (for a choice of Haar measure on $G$) and acts on smooth representations of $G$. In fact, smooth representations of $G$ are literally the same as smooth representations of $C_c^\\infty(G)$, so it plays the role of the group algebra $\\mathbf{C}[G]$ for $G$ finite. But unlike the group algebra, this ring won't usually have a multiplicative identity.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me start by reading the original problem carefully.\n\nThe title is \"Are there interesting rings without unity?\" and the question mentions that many introductory textbooks define rings without requiring a unity element. However, most rings encountered in various areas of math have a unity. The user is asking for examples of rings without unity that arise naturally in mathematical theories, excluding two-sided ideals since they're usually not considered as rings on their own but as modules or equivalence classes for quotient rings (which do have unity).\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem is about finding examples of rings without unity that occur naturally. The user specifies that two-sided ideals shouldn't count because they're typically not treated as rings themselves. So the assumptions here are:\n\n1. The ring does not have a multiplicative identity (unity).\n2. The ring arises naturally in a mathematical theory.\n3. Two-sided ideals are excluded as examples.\n\nEach assumption should be on a separate line, addressing one property or condition for one object. Let me check:\n\n- The first assumption is about the ring lacking unity.\n- The second is about the ring occurring naturally in math.\n- The third excludes a specific type of example (two-sided ideals).\n\nThe problem statement then is to provide examples of such rings.\n\nWait, the original question is asking others to show examples, so the problem part should reflect that request. So the problem is: \"Show some examples of rings without unity that arise naturally in a mathematical theory, excluding two-sided ideals.\"\n\nBut the user says \"show me some examples\", so the problem is to provide such examples. However, in the example given by the user (the A(n) problem), the formatted problem is \"Prove that...\". So maybe the problem here is to \"Show examples of rings without unity that arise naturally in mathematical theories, excluding two-sided ideals.\"\n\nBut I need to make sure the assumptions are correctly listed. The original problem states that two-sided ideals don't count because they aren't considered rings in their own right. So the assumptions for the examples to be valid are:\n\n- The example is a ring without unity.\n- The example arises naturally in a mathematical theory.\n- The example is not a two-sided ideal considered as a ring.\n\nThus, the assumptions should list these conditions. Let me structure that.\n\nAssumption:\nThe ring does not have a multiplicative identity (unity).\nThe ring arises naturally in a mathematical theory.\nTwo-sided ideals are excluded as valid examples.\n\nProblem: Show examples of such rings.\n\nBut the user's example had each assumption as a separate line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let me check the example again:\n\nIn the example, the assumptions were:\n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\n\nEach is a separate line, each about one property of the same object (n). Similarly here, the assumptions are about the ring (object) having three conditions. But each assumption line should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So each line here would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe ring does not have a multiplicative identity (unity).\nThe ring arises naturally in a mathematical theory.\nThe example is not a two-sided ideal considered as a ring.\n\nWait, maybe better wording. Let me rephrase to make each line about one property:\n\nAssumption:\nThe ring lacks a multiplicative identity (unity).\nThe ring occurs naturally in a mathematical theory.\nThe ring is not a two-sided ideal of another ring.\n\nYes, each line is a separate condition about the ring (the object). So that's three assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have these three assumptions and the problem statement asking to show examples of such rings.\n\nLet me verify with the original question:\n\nOriginal problem says: \"show me some examples of rings without unity arising naturally in a mathematical theory. (Two-sided ideals don't count as an example, because normally, they aren't considered as rings in their own right, but as modules or equivalence classes, allowing you to pass to a quotient ring (with $1$).)\"\n\nSo the three key points are:\n\n1. Ring without unity.\n2. Arising naturally.\n3. Not two-sided ideals.\n\nThus, the formatted problem should have these three assumptions and the problem is to show examples.",
