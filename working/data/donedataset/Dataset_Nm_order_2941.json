    "Content": "I was studying Mathematical Induction when I came across the following problem: The Fibonacci numbers are the sequence of numbers defined by the linear recurrence equation- $f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2} $ with $f_1 = f_2 = 1$ Use induction to show that $f_n \\; | \\; f_{2n}$ ( $f_n$ divides $f_{2n}$ ) Basis Step is obviously true; but I'm facing difficulty in the Inductive Step. If I assume the inductive hypothesis to be true for some $k$ , i.e., $ \\dfrac{ f_{2k} } { f_{k} } = c$ (For some positive integer $c > 0$ ), I'm not clear as to how I should proceed further and prove that $P(2k+1)$ is also true. I'm new here, so if I'm doing anything wrong, please overlook it on the account of my naivety.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "From the start, there isn't a clear statement to induct on. As such, you have to guess the induction hypothesis, and find an explicit pattern which you could describe. Hint: Look at the sequence of values of $\\frac{f_{2k}}{f_k}$. Do you see a pattern there? That suggests to prove the following fact: $$ \\frac{f_{2k+2}} { f_{k+1} } = \\frac{f_{2k} } { f_k } + \\frac{f_{2k-2} } {f_{k-1} } $$ Check that the first two terms of this series $g_n = \\frac{f_{2n}}{f_n}$ are integers, hence conclude by induction that every term is an integer.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the given problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified structure. The example provided shows how assumptions are listed and the problem is restated.\n\nFirst, I need to read the original problem carefully. The title is \"Proof by induction on Fibonacci numbers: show that f_n divides f_{2n}\". The question describes using induction to prove that for Fibonacci numbers defined by f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2} with f_1 = f_2 = 1, f_n divides f_{2n}. The user mentions the basis step is true but struggles with the inductive step.\n\nNow, applying the format. The assumptions need to be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nAssumptions here would include:\n- The Fibonacci sequence is defined by f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2} for n > 2. (This is the recurrence relation.)\n- The initial conditions f_1 = 1 and f_2 = 1. (These start the sequence.)\n- The problem uses mathematical induction. (The user is asked to use induction.)\n- The divisibility holds for the basis case, which is n=1. (Though the user says basis step is obviously true, but maybe this is part of the problem's setup.)\n\nWait, but in the example given, the assumptions listed were about n being an integer and n divisible by 7. So here, the problem is about Fibonacci numbers and induction. The assumptions should be the conditions given in the problem. Let me parse the problem again.\n\nOriginal problem states:\n- Fibonacci numbers defined by f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2}\n- f_1 = f_2 = 1\n- Need to prove f_n divides f_{2n} using induction.\n\nSo the assumptions are the definition of Fibonacci numbers, their initial conditions, and the method of induction. However, in the example, the assumption included specific conditions on n (integer, divisible by 7). Here, the problem doesn't specify any restrictions on n except that it's a positive integer, since Fibonacci numbers are typically defined for positive integers. But the user is using induction, so n is an integer, perhaps starting from 1. However, the original problem doesn't explicitly state n is an integer, but that's implicit in the context of Fibonacci numbers. But maybe the problem assumes n is a positive integer.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n1. The Fibonacci sequence is defined by f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2} for n > 2.\n2. f_1 = 1.\n3. f_2 = 1.\n4. n is a positive integer.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that f_n divides f_{2n} for all positive integers n. The original problem doesn't mention any other conditions on n, so the assumptions should list the necessary conditions given in the problem. The example included \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption because the original problem had that condition. Here, the problem is general for all positive integers n, but the proof is via induction, so the induction step would involve assuming it's true for k and proving for k+1 or 2k+1 as per the user's mention.\n\nWait, the user's original question says \"show that f_n divides f_{2n}\" using induction. The basis step is true, and they're stuck on the inductive step. So the problem is to use induction to prove that for all positive integers n, f_n divides f_{2n}.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are the Fibonacci definition, initial terms, and n being a positive integer. However, the example included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in this problem, there's no such restriction. So perhaps the key here is to list all the given conditions from the problem statement.\n\nSo formatted:\n\nAssumption:\nThe Fibonacci numbers are defined by f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2} for n > 2,\nf_1 = 1,\nf_2 = 1,\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve by induction that f_n divides f_{2n}.\n\nWait, but in the example, the problem was restated as \"Prove that A(n)...\" with the expression. Here, the problem is to prove f_n divides f_{2n} using induction, but the example didn't include the method (induction) in the problem statement. The example's problem was just \"Prove that... is divisible by 91.\" So maybe the method (induction) is part of the problem's instruction, not an assumption. Hmm, the example's assumption included \"n is divisible by 7,\" which was part of the problem's original condition.\n\nWait, looking back at the example:\n\nOriginal problem had \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem's assumption lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n,\" but in the formatted problem, the assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7.\" That must be a mistake. Wait, no. Wait the original problem was:\n\n\"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\"\n\nBut in the formatted problem, the assumption is:\n\nn is an integer,\n\nn is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n,\" so why is the assumption in the formatted problem that n is divisible by 7? That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe there was a mistake in the example. Because if the problem is to prove it for every integer n, then the assumption shouldn't restrict n to be divisible by 7. Unless there was a misinterpretation.\n\nWait, perhaps the example was incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem had a condition that n is divisible by 7, but the user wrote it wrong. Let me check again.\n\nThe example says:\n\nOriginal problem:\n\nProve that for every integer n, the number  \nA(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n)  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: \nn is an integer,\nn is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that can't be right. The original problem states \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That would change the problem to only n divisible by 7. That's a mistake. But the user provided this example, so maybe the user made an error. However, in the current task, I should follow the user's example as given, even if it's incorrect. So perhaps in the example, the user incorrectly added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption when the original problem didn't state that. So maybe in this current problem, I should extract the correct assumptions as per the problem's statement.\n\nBut given that the example added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (n divisible by 7), perhaps the user is expecting to include all the conditions necessary for the problem, even if they are implicit. For instance, in the Fibonacci problem, n being a positive integer is implicit, but necessary. Also, the definition of Fibonacci numbers and their initial terms.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the current problem:\n\nOriginal problem states the Fibonacci numbers are defined by f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2} with f_1 = f_2 = 1. The task is to prove by induction that f_n divides f_{2n}.\n\nSo assumptions:\n\n1. The Fibonacci sequence is defined by f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2} for n > 2.\n2. f_1 = 1.\n3. f_2 = 1.\n4. n is a positive integer.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the assumption included n being an integer and divisible by 7, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". That suggests that in the example, perhaps the original problem had a typo, and the user intended to have n divisible by 7. Alternatively, perhaps the example is wrong, but the user provided it as an example, so we have to follow the structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's example is incorrect, but since the user provided it, I have to proceed. However, in the current problem, the assumptions should be as per the original problem's explicit conditions.\n\nSo the Fibonacci problem's assumptions are:\n\n- Fibonacci numbers defined by the recurrence f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2} for n > 2.\n- f_1 = 1.\n- f_2 = 1.\n- The problem is to use mathematical induction.\n\nBut wait, the method (induction) is part of the problem's instruction, not an assumption. In the example, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7,\" which was part of the problem's condition. So perhaps in this case, the assumptions are just the properties of the Fibonacci sequence and n being a positive integer.\n\nThus, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nThe Fibonacci numbers satisfy f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2} for n > 2,\nf_1 = 1,\nf_2 = 1,\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve by induction that f_n divides f_{2n}.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem statement includes the induction method, so \"use induction\" is part of the problem, not an assumption. In the example, the problem was \"Prove that... is divisible by 91,\" and the assumptions were the conditions on n. So here, the problem is to prove by induction that f_n divides f_{2n}. Therefore, the method (induction) is part of the problem statement, not an assumption.\n\nHence, the assumptions are the properties of the Fibonacci numbers and that n is a positive integer. The problem is to prove by induction that f_n divides f_{2n}.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nThe Fibonacci sequence is defined by f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2} for n > 2,\nf_1 = 1,\nf_2 = 1,\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve by induction that f_n divides f_{2n}.\n\nYes, that seems right. Each assumption is a single condition applied to one object. The first three lines define the Fibonacci sequence, and the fourth specifies the domain of n.",
