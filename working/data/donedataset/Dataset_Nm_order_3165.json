    "AcceptedAnswer": "Since $P$ has $n$ real roots we can write \n\\begin{eqnarray}\nP(x) & = & x^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\\cdots a_2x^2 -nx + a_0 \\\\\n& = & (x-x_1)(x-x_2)\\cdots(x-x_n) \\\\\n& = & x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\cdots a_2x^2 +(-1)^{n-1}(\\sum_{i=1}^n\\prod_{j\\neq i} x_j)\\, x + x_1x_2\\cdots x_n\n\\end{eqnarray}\nTherefore $x_1x_2\\cdots x_n = a_0$ and $(-1)^{n-1}(\\sum_{i=1}^n\\prod_{j\\neq i} x_j) = -n$. But since $n$ is even the latter equality together with $\\prod_{j\\neq i}x_j = \\dfrac{a_0}{x_i}$ gives $\\sum_{i=1}^n\\dfrac{a_0}{x_i} = n$. By assumption $P(0)= a_0 = x_1x_2\\cdots x_n\\geq1$.\nHowever, by the AM-GM inequality, $$1=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n\\dfrac{a_0}{x_i}}{n}\\geq a_0\\left(\\frac{1}{x_1x_2\\cdots x_n}\\right)^\\frac{1}{n} = a_0^{1-\\frac{1}{n}}\\geq 1$$ with equality only at $\\dfrac{a_0}{x_1}=\\dfrac{a_0}{x_2}=\\ldots=\\dfrac{a_0}{x_n}$. Because equality holds, we know that all $\\dfrac{a_0}{x_i}=1$ and therefore $\\dfrac{a_0^n}{x_1x_2\\cdots x_n} = a_0^{n-1} = 1$ which implies $a_0=1$ and hence $x_i=1.$ $P(2) = 1$ now follows directly as desired.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem step by step. First, the user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example they provided shows that the assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object. Then the problem statement follows.\n\nLooking at the original problem from Math Stack Exchange:\n\nTitle: Polynomial puzzle\nQuestion: Let $P$ be a polynomial of even degree $n$ with real coefficients and $n$ real positive roots, defined by\n  $$P(x)=x^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\\cdots+a_2x^2-nx+a_0$$\n  such that $P(0)\\ge 1$. Prove that $P(2)=1$.\n\nFirst, I need to extract all the assumptions. Let's break down the problem sentence by sentence.\n\n1. \"Let $P$ be a polynomial of even degree $n$ with real coefficients...\" \n   - Assumption: $P$ is a polynomial.\n   - Assumption: The degree of $P$ is $n$.\n   - Assumption: $n$ is even.\n   - Assumption: $P$ has real coefficients.\n\n2. \"...and $n$ real positive roots...\"\n   - Assumption: $P$ has $n$ real positive roots. Since it's a degree $n$ polynomial, this implies all roots are real and positive.\n\n3. \"defined by $$P(x)=x^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\\cdots+a_2x^2-nx+a_0$$\"\n   - The polynomial is given in this specific form. The coefficients are $a_{n-1}$ down to $a_2$, then the term $-n x$, and the constant term $a_0$. So, note that the coefficient of $x$ is $-n$.\n\n4. \"such that $P(0)\\ge 1$.\"\n   - Assumption: $P(0) \\geq 1$. Since $P(0)$ is the constant term $a_0$, this means $a_0 \\geq 1$.\n\nNow, the problem is to prove that $P(2) = 1$.\n\nWait, in the original problem, the user wrote \"PS: I already know a solution. I'm just sharing this for fun.\" But that's part of the question's context, not part of the problem itself. So in formatting, we can ignore the PS.\n\nSo compiling the assumptions:\n\n- $P$ is a polynomial of even degree $n$.\n- $P$ has real coefficients.\n- $P$ has $n$ real positive roots.\n- $P$ is defined as $x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_2x^2 - nx + a_0$.\n- $P(0) \\geq 1$.\n\nBut each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So breaking down each point:\n\n1. $P$ is a polynomial.\n2. The degree of $P$ is $n$.\n3. $n$ is even.\n4. $P$ has real coefficients.\n5. $P$ has $n$ real roots. (But the original says \"positive roots\", so maybe specify each root is positive)\n6. All roots of $P$ are positive. (Since it says $n$ real positive roots)\n7. $P$ is defined by the expression $x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_2x^2 - nx + a_0$.\n8. The coefficient of $x$ in $P$ is $-n$.\n9. $P(0) \\geq 1$.\n\nWait, the structure of the polynomial is given, so maybe some of these can be combined. Let's check the example given. In the example, assumptions were listed as separate lines, each with one condition.\n\nOriginal example had:\n\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nSo each assumption is a separate line. So for the current problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- $P$ is a polynomial of even degree $n$.\nWait, but \"even degree n\" is two properties: degree is n, and n is even. So maybe split into:\n\n- The degree of $P$ is $n$.\n- $n$ is even.\n- $P$ has real coefficients.\n- $P$ has $n$ real positive roots.\n- $P(x) = x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_2x^2 - nx + a_0$.\n- $P(0) \\geq 1$.\n\nWait, the polynomial's form is part of the problem statement. So in the example, the user included the structure of A(n) in the problem statement. So in this case, the structure of P(x) is part of the problem's given. So the assumptions would be the conditions on P, and the problem is to prove P(2)=1.\n\nBut in the example, the original problem had \"A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1 ) - 6^n (3^n +2^n )\", and the formatted problem included that in the problem statement. So similarly, here the specific form of P(x) should be part of the problem statement. So the assumptions are the conditions on P, not including its specific form. Wait, no, the problem defines P as a polynomial with that specific form. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- The degree of P is n.\n- n is even.\n- P has real coefficients.\n- P has n real positive roots.\n- P(x) is defined as x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_2x^2 - nx + a_0.\n- P(0) >= 1.\n\nBut each of these is separate. However, the specific form of P(x) is part of the problem's given, so that's an assumption about the structure of P. So each part needs to be an assumption.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem had A(n) defined in a certain way, and that was included in the problem statement. So here, the definition of P(x) would be part of the problem statement, but in the example, the definition was part of the problem. Wait, the example formatted the problem as:\n\nProblem: Prove that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$ is divisible by 91.\n\nSo the definition of A(n) is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. So in this case, maybe the structure of P(x) is part of the problem statement. But in the original problem here, the user includes the definition of P(x) as part of the problem's setup, so perhaps that should be part of the problem statement. However, the example's assumptions included \"n is divisible by 7\", which was part of the original problem's conditions. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to separate the conditions (assumptions) from the actual problem statement. The problem statement includes what needs to be proven, along with any necessary definitions. So in the example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and divisible by 7, and the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, with A(n) defined as part of the problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the definition of P(x) is part of the given setup. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- P is a polynomial of even degree n with real coefficients.\n- P has n real positive roots.\n- P is defined by P(x) = x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_2x^2 - nx + a_0.\n- P(0) ≥ 1.\n\nBut each of these needs to be broken into single-line assumptions. Let's see:\n\n1. The degree of P is n.\n2. n is even.\n3. P has real coefficients.\n4. P has n real positive roots.\n5. P is defined as x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_2x^2 - nx + a_0.\n6. P(0) ≥ 1.\n\nThat's six assumptions, each addressing one property. The problem then is to prove that P(2) = 1.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"Prove that P(2) = 1\". So putting it all together:\n\nAssumption: \nThe degree of $P$ is $n$,\n$n$ is even,\n$P$ has real coefficients,\n$P$ has $n$ real positive roots,\n$P$ is defined by $x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_2x^2 - nx + a_0$,\n$P(0) \\geq 1$.\n\nProblem: Prove that $P(2) = 1$.\n\nBut let's check the example again. In the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". So they split \"for every integer n\" into an assumption, then added another assumption. So in this case, the original problem says \"Let P be a polynomial of even degree n with real coefficients and n real positive roots, defined by [expression] such that P(0) ≥ 1.\" So all those are the conditions (assumptions) on P. Therefore, each of those should be separate assumptions.\n\nYes, that seems right. Therefore, the formatted problem should list each condition as a separate assumption. The fact that the polynomial is defined by that specific expression is an assumption about its structure. The coefficient of x is -n, but that's part of the definition of P(x). So the structure is given, so that's an assumption. Then P(0) ≥ 1 is another assumption.\n\nSo the final answer should be:\n\nAssumption: \nThe degree of $P$ is $n$,\n$n$ is even,\n$P$ has real coefficients,\n$P$ has $n$ real positive roots,\n$P$ is defined by $x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_2x^2 - nx + a_0$,\n$P(0) \\geq 1$.\n\nProblem: Prove that $P(2) = 1$.",
