    "AcceptedAnswer": "Denoting by $\\widehat{\\cdot}$ the Fourier transform in $\\mathbb R^d$ and letting\n$$\nf_\\lambda(x)\\equiv f(\\lambda x),\n$$ \nthen, by definition of the Fourier transform,\n\\begin{align}\n\\widehat {f_\\lambda}(k)&=\\int_{\\mathbb R^n}e^{-ik\\cdot x}f(\\lambda x)dx\\\\\n&=\\int_{\\mathbb R^n}e^{-ik\\cdot x/\\lambda}f(x)\\lambda^{-d}dx\\\\\n&=\\lambda^{-d}\\widehat f(k/\\lambda).\n\\end{align}\nLet $f(x)=F(|x|)$ be a radial function;\nif $M\\in SO(d)$, then $f_M(x)\\equiv f(Mx)=f(x)$ and hence, since $\\widehat{ f_M}(k)=\\widehat f(Mk)$, we have $\\widehat {f_M}= \\widehat f$, which in turn implies that also $\\widehat f$ is radial. Now, suppose $f(x)=|x|^{-\\alpha}$, for $0<\\alpha<d$, then \n$$\nf_\\lambda(x) = \\lambda^{-\\alpha}f(x)\n$$\nand, by the above remark,\n$$\n\\widehat f (k/\\lambda)= \\lambda^{d}\\widehat {f_\\lambda}(k) = \\lambda^{d-\\alpha}\\hat f(k).\n$$\nThe only radial $\\widehat f$ homogeneous of degree $-d+\\alpha$ is \n$$\n\\widehat f (k) = |k|^{\\alpha-d},\n$$\nup to constants. Note that $f$ can be split as the sum of two pieces: let $B_a$ be the ball of radius $a$ centred at the origin, then\n\\begin{align}\nf&\\equiv u+v\\\\\n&=\n\\chi_{B_a}(x)\\frac{1}{|x|^{\\alpha}}+\\left(1-\\chi_{B_a}(x)\\right)\\frac{1}{|x|^{\\alpha}};\n\\end{align}\n$u$ lies in $L^1(\\mathbb R^d)$, for $0<\\alpha<d$, and $v$ lies in $L^2(\\mathbb R^d)$, for $\\alpha>d/2$. This ensures $\\widehat u \\in L^\\infty(\\mathbb R^d)$ and $\\widehat v\\in L^2(\\mathbb R^d)$ and that $\\widehat f$ needs indeed to be a function in $L^1_{\\text{loc}}(\\mathbb R^d)$ from an abstract point of view.\nSo $f,\\widehat f\\in L^1_{\\text{loc}}(\\mathbb R^d)$. More generally, $f$ lies in $\\mathscr S'(\\mathbb R^d)$, which is stable under Fourier transform.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a math professor, read the Math Stack Exchange question, filter out unrelated info, and present it with assumptions and the problem. \n\nLooking at the example provided, the key was to list each assumption line by line, focusing on one property per line applied to a single object. Then restate the problem concisely.\n\nThe original question here is about proving an identity involving the Fourier transform of 1/|x|^α. The user also mentions wanting to calculate the Fourier transform of that function. Let's parse the given problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the identity given is:\nC_α ∫_{ℝⁿ} 1/|x|^α φ(x) dx = C_{n−α} ∫_{ℝⁿ} 1/|x|^{n−α} φ̂(x) dx\n\nAssumptions from the problem:\n- φ: ℝⁿ → ℂ is in the Schwartz space. So one assumption is about φ being a Schwartz function.\n- 0 < α < n. This is a condition on α.\n- C_β is defined as Γ(β/2)/π^{β/2}. So another assumption is the definition of C_β.\n- The Fourier transform φ̂(x) is given by the integral ∫_{ℝⁿ} φ(y) e^{-2πi x·y} dy. That's the definition of the Fourier transform here.\n\nEach of these should be separate lines in the assumptions. The problem statement is to prove the identity, which essentially asks to compute the Fourier transform of 1/|x|^α.\n\nNow, checking if there's any extra info. The title mentions Fourier transform of 1/|x|^α, which the question restates. The problem as written includes the identity and the explicit question. So the formatted problem should capture all necessary assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nI need to list each assumption one by one:\n1. φ is a function from ℝⁿ to ℂ in the Schwartz space.\n2. 0 < α < n.\n3. C_β is defined as Γ(β/2)/π^{β/2}.\n4. The Fourier transform φ̂(x) is given by the integral ∫_{ℝⁿ} φ(y)e^{-2πi x·y} dy.\n\nThen the problem is to prove the given identity, which is equivalent to computing the Fourier transform of 1/|x|^α.\n\nI should ensure that each assumption is on its own line, addresses one property, and applies to one object. For example, φ being Schwartz is one line, the range of α another, definition of C_β another, and the definition of the Fourier transform another. That seems to fit the format. The problem then is the identity statement. The original question also asks \"how to calculate Fourier transform of 1/|x|^α\", which is essentially the same as proving the identity given. So the problem part can include both, but in the example, they combined it. So maybe state the problem as proving the identity, which answers the Fourier transform question.\n\nI need to make sure there's no extra info. The title mentions Fourier transform of 1/|x|^α, which is covered in the problem statement. The user also mentions \"In other words...\", so combining both into the problem statement makes sense.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nφ is a function from ℝⁿ to ℂ,\nφ is in the Schwartz space,\n0 < α < n,\nC_β is defined as Γ(β/2)/π^{β/2} for any β,\nThe Fourier transform of φ is defined as ∫_{ℝⁿ} φ(y)e^{-2πi x·y} dy.\n\nProblem: Prove that \n$$C_{\\alpha}\\int_{\\mathbb R^n} \\frac{1}{|x|^\\alpha} \\phi(x) dx = C_{n-\\alpha}\\int_{\\mathbb R^n} \\frac{1}{|x|^{n-\\alpha}} \\widehat{\\phi}(x) dx,$$\ni.e., compute the Fourier transform of $1/|x|^\\alpha$.\n\nWait, but in the example, each assumption is a separate line. So maybe split the first line into two: one for φ being from ℝⁿ to ℂ, and another for φ being in Schwartz space. Similarly, maybe split the definition of C_β into its own line. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are separate. So here, φ's domain and codomain is one assumption, and φ being in Schwartz space is another. Similarly, C_β's definition is a separate assumption.\n\nSo revised assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\nφ: ℝⁿ → ℂ,\nφ is in the Schwartz space,\n0 < α < n,\nC_β is defined as Γ(β/2)/π^{β/2} for any β,\nThe Fourier transform of φ is given by ∫_{ℝⁿ} φ(y)e^{-2πi x·y} dy.\n\nProblem: Prove that \n$$C_{\\alpha}\\int_{\\mathbb R^n} \\frac{1}{|x|^\\alpha} \\phi(x) dx = C_{n-\\alpha}\\int_{\\mathbb R^n} \\frac{1}{|x|^{n-\\alpha}} \\widehat{\\phi}(x) dx,$$\ni.e., compute the Fourier transform of $1/|x|^\\alpha$.\n\nYes, that splits each condition into separate lines. Each line is a single property for one object. The problem statement combines both the identity and the Fourier transform computation.",
