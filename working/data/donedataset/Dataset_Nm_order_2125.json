    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should list each condition line by line, focusing on one property per line. The problem is then restated concisely.\n\nThe original problem from Math Stack Exchange is about showing that two integrals are equal. The integrals are from 0 to π/2 of 1/√(sin x) dx and 2/√(2 - sin²x) dx. The user tried many things but didn't have luck.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem statement doesn't mention any explicit conditions like the example did (like n being an integer or divisible by 7). However, when dealing with integrals, especially involving square roots and trigonometric functions, there might be implicit assumptions about the domain where the integrands are defined and continuous.\n\nLooking at the first integral, 1/√(sin x). The square root is defined when sin x is non-negative, which it is between 0 and π. But since the integral is from 0 to π/2, sin x is positive in (0, π/2], and at x=0, sin x = 0, which would make the integrand undefined. However, we need to check if the integral converges at x=0. Similarly, the second integrand is 2/√(2 - sin²x). The expression under the square root is 2 - sin²x. Since sin²x ranges from 0 to 1 in [0, π/2], 2 - sin²x ranges from 2 to 1, so the denominator is always positive, making the integrand defined everywhere in [0, π/2]. At x=0, sin x=0, so denominator is √2, which is fine. So no issues there except maybe at the endpoints.\n\nBut the original problem states the integrals are equal. So assumptions would be about the functions being integrable over the interval, and perhaps the substitution used to relate them. Wait, but the example's assumptions were about the variables in the problem. Here, the variables are x from 0 to π/2, and the functions are defined there except at x=0 for the first integral. However, since the problem is about equality of integrals, the key assumptions would be that both integrals exist (i.e., are convergent). So maybe the first integral is convergent despite the singularity at x=0. Let me check:\n\nNear x=0, sin x ≈ x, so 1/√(sin x) ≈ 1/√x, which integrates to 2√x evaluated near 0, which converges. So the integral is convergent. So the assumptions would include that the integrals are convergent over [0, π/2].\n\nBut the example had specific conditions applied to the object (like n being integer). Here, the assumptions are about the integrability of the functions on the interval. However, the problem as stated just asks to show the equality, so maybe the only assumption is that x is in [0, π/2] and the integrals are convergent. But the user's example didn't include such assumptions. Wait, the example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, the problem is about real integrals, so perhaps the key assumption is the interval of integration, and the functions being integrable there. However, the original problem might not state these explicitly, so perhaps the only assumption is the interval of integration. Wait, but the example included assumptions from the original problem. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe original question is \"Showing that ∫₀^{π/2} 1/√(sin x) dx = ∫₀^{π/2} 2/√(2 - sin²x) dx?\" The user didn't mention any conditions except the limits of integration. So the assumptions here would be:\n\n- The integrals are taken over the interval [0, π/2].\n- The integrand 1/√(sin x) is defined and integrable on (0, π/2].\n- The integrand 2/√(2 - sin²x) is defined and integrable on [0, π/2].\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were listed as properties applied to one object each. So here, the objects are the integrals, but maybe the assumptions are about the variable x being in [0, π/2], and the functions being integrable. Alternatively, since the problem is to show equality, maybe there's a substitution or identity involved, but the user might not have mentioned that.\n\nWait, the problem is presented as is, so the user is asking how to show the equality. The assumptions are inherent in the problem statement: the limits of integration and the functions involved. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The integrals are from 0 to π/2.\n- The function 1/√(sin x) is integrable over [0, π/2].\n- The function 2/√(2 - sin²x) is integrable over [0, π/2].\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about the variable n. Here, the variable is x, but the problem doesn't state any conditions on x beyond the integration interval. Maybe the key assumption is the interval of integration. Since the problem states the integral limits, the main assumption is that x ranges from 0 to π/2. But how to phrase that? In the example, each assumption was a single line. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is over the interval [0, π/2],\nThe function 1/√(sin x) is integrable on [0, π/2],\nThe function 2/√(2 - sin²x) is integrable on [0, π/2].\n\nBut the problem as stated doesn't mention integrability; it's just given. Since the user is asking to prove the equality, the assumptions are the given integrals' structure. Alternatively, maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond the integral limits. The example included \"n is an integer\" which was part of the original problem. Here, the original problem states the integral limits, so the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integrals are computed from 0 to π/2.\n\nBut that seems too brief. Alternatively, since the problem is to show equality, perhaps the substitution used requires some conditions, like the substitution being valid in the interval. But the user didn't mention any substitutions. Alternatively, maybe there's a trigonometric identity involved. But since the example's assumptions were explicit in the problem statement, here the problem statement only gives the integrals and the interval. So the main assumption is the interval of integration. However, the example had two assumptions: n is integer and n divisible by 7, but the original problem here doesn't have such variables. So perhaps the only assumption here is the interval [0, π/2].\n\nBut wait, the example's original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, and the formatted problem had n is integer and n divisible by 7. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that seems like an error. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an extra condition that n is divisible by 7. But that would restrict the problem. Maybe that was a mistake in the example. But perhaps the user intended that? Hmm, maybe the example was a bad one, but according to the user's instruction, the formatted problem should include all assumptions from the original problem. If the original problem says \"for every integer n\", then the assumption should be \"n is an integer\". But in the formatted example, there's an extra \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. So maybe the example is wrong. But the user provided it, so perhaps in their example, they filtered out some information. Wait, the original problem in the example was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n)... is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem's assumptions are \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But that's incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which means it should hold for any integer n, not just those divisible by 7. So perhaps the example is wrong, but the user provided it, so I need to follow their structure.\n\nWait, maybe the example had a typo. Maybe the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n divisible by 7, A(n) is divisible by 91.\" Then the assumptions would make sense. But the user wrote the original problem as \"for every integer n\", which contradicts the formatted assumptions. This is confusing. But perhaps the user's example is incorrect, but I have to follow their format regardless.\n\nIn any case, returning to the current problem. The problem is to show the equality of two integrals over [0, π/2]. The assumptions here would be the limits of integration and perhaps the integrability, but since the problem is presented as is, maybe the only assumption is the interval. However, in the example, assumptions included conditions on the variable (n being integer, n divisible by 7), even if the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So perhaps in this case, even though the original problem doesn't state any restrictions beyond the integral limits, the assumptions would list the interval and the functions' properties necessary for the integrals to exist.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem doesn't have any additional assumptions beyond what's given, so the assumptions section would be empty, but the example shows that even obvious assumptions (like n being integer) are listed. Therefore, for the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is from 0 to π/2,\nThe function 1/√(sin x) is integrable on [0, π/2],\nThe function 2/√(2 - sin²x) is integrable on [0, π/2].\n\nBut perhaps in the context of the problem, the key assumption is just the interval, and the functions are given. Alternatively, since the problem is to show equality, maybe there's an implicit substitution or identity, but those aren't assumptions. The problem as stated doesn't provide other conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to show the equality without any additional conditions, so the only assumption is the interval of integration. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integrals are computed from 0 to π/2.\n\nBut that seems too minimal. However, in the example, the original problem was \"for every integer n\", so the assumption was \"n is an integer\", and another assumption \"n is divisible by 7\" was added, which wasn't in the original problem. That suggests that the example might have been incorrect, but following the user's example, perhaps I need to extract the conditions from the problem statement.\n\nIn the current problem, the integrals are definite integrals with specified limits, so the assumption is that the variable x ranges from 0 to π/2. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe variable x is in the interval [0, π/2].\n\nBut the example's assumptions were about the variable's properties (n being integer, etc.). So here, x is in [0, π/2]. But the problem is about equality of integrals, so maybe each integral's assumptions are:\n\n- For the first integral: The integrand 1/√(sin x) is defined and integrable over [0, π/2].\n- For the second integral: The integrand 2/√(2 - sin²x) is defined and integrable over [0, π/2].\n\nBut since the problem asks to show the equality, these are necessary assumptions for the integrals to exist. Therefore, the assumptions section should list these.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nThe first integral is over the interval [0, π/2],\nThe second integral is over the interval [0, π/2],\nThe integrand 1/√(sin x) is integrable on [0, π/2],\nThe integrand 2/√(2 - sin²x) is integrable on [0, π/2].\n\nBut this seems redundant. Alternatively, combining them:\n\nAssumption:\nBoth integrals are computed over the interval [0, π/2],\nThe integrand 1/√(sin x) is integrable on [0, π/2],\nThe integrand 2/√(2 - sin²x) is integrable on [0, π/2].\n\nBut maybe the user expects each assumption to be one line per property per object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe first integral is from 0 to π/2,\nThe second integral is from 0 to π/2,\nThe function 1/√(sin x) is integrable on [0, π/2],\nThe function 2/√(2 - sin²x) is integrable on [0, π/2].\n\nBut the problem statement already mentions the integrals are from 0 to π/2, so these are part of the problem, not assumptions. Wait, the example's original problem included \"for every integer n\", which was listed as an assumption. So in this case, the integral limits are part of the problem statement, not assumptions. Therefore, the only assumption might be the integrability, but that's implicit. The example didn't list \"A(n) is defined\" as an assumption, so perhaps the user's format requires only explicit conditions from the problem.\n\nWait, the example's formatted problem had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". The original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem lists n being integer and divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Unless the original problem had a typo. But assuming the example is correct as per the user, then in their format, the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. So if the problem says \"for every integer n\", then the assumption is \"n is an integer\". If there's another condition, like divisibility by 7, that would be another assumption.\n\nBut in the current problem, the question is to show the equality of two integrals over [0, π/2]. There are no variables with conditions like n being integer. The only conditions are the limits of integration and the functions involved. Since the example's assumptions included the variable's conditions, here we have no variables other than x, which is integrated over the interval. Therefore, perhaps there are no additional assumptions beyond the problem statement. But the example shows that even if the problem states \"for every integer n\", the assumption is listed. So in this case, since the problem states the integrals are from 0 to π/2, maybe the assumption is:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integrals are computed from 0 to π/2.\n\nBut that's part of the problem statement. Alternatively, maybe the user's example is different, and in cases where there are no explicit assumptions (like variables with conditions), the assumptions section is omitted. But the user's example shows that even if the problem states \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. Therefore, in the current problem, since the integrals are from 0 to π/2, the assumption would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integrals are over the interval [0, π/2].\n\nBut that's redundant because the problem states that. However, following the example, even if the problem states \"for every integer n\", the assumption is listed. Therefore, here, the assumption would list the integral limits as part of the problem's conditions.\n\nBut then, the example's formatted problem changed the original problem's statement. The original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem's assumptions included n divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. That seems like a mistake, but perhaps the user intended to show that sometimes assumptions are implicit. However, that's unclear.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll proceed by listing the integral limits as assumptions because in the example, the variable's conditions (n is integer) were listed even though the problem stated \"for every integer n\". Therefore, here, the integral limits are part of the problem's given conditions, so they are listed as assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is computed from 0 to π/2,\nThe integrand 1/√(sin x) is integrable on [0, π/2],\nThe integrand 2/√(2 - sin²x) is integrable on [0, π/2].\n\nProblem:\nShow that  \n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\sin{x}}}\\;{dx}=\\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2-\\sin^2{x}}}\\;{dx} $$\n\nBut checking the original problem's title, the integrals are written as:\n\n∫₀^{π/2} 1/√(sin x) dx and ∫₀^{π/2} 2/√(2 - sin²x) dx\n\nSo the problem statement is correctly restated. The assumptions would then include the integrability, but since the problem is to show equality, the main assumption is the interval. However, the example included two assumptions for one object (n is integer, n divisible by 7). Here, there are two integrands, so each integrand's integrability is an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user considers the interval as the only assumption. But given the example's structure, where each assumption is a separate line, even if they apply to different objects, I think it's better to list the interval and the integrability of each function.\n\nBut to confirm, let's check the example again. The original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions are n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that's conflicting because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which doesn't restrict n to being divisible by 7. This suggests that perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user provided it as an example. Therefore, maybe in the user's format, assumptions include both the conditions given in the problem and any additional ones needed. But that would be confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the example was a misrepresentation, but I need to follow the user's instruction regardless.\n\nIn the current problem, since the integrals are given over [0, π/2], and the functions are defined there (with convergence at 0 for the first integral), the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integrals are computed from 0 to π/2.\n\nBut since the example lists even obvious assumptions (n is an integer), perhaps here, the assumption is just the interval. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integrals are computed from 0 to π/2.\n\nProblem:\nShow that  \n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\sin{x}}}\\;{dx}=\\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2-\\sin^2{x}}}\\;{dx} $$\n\nThis seems the most straightforward, following the example where the problem's explicit condition (n is an integer) is listed as an assumption.
