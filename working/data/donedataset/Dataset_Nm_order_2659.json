    "Content": "In my textbook \"Elementary Number Theory with Applications\" by Thomas Koshy on pg. 16, there is an example given just after the well ordering principle: Prove that there is no positive integer between $0$ and $1$ . My question is how can you even start this proof? I checked the book and google for a formal definition of integers, but they are pretty vague. The book just says $\\{\\ldots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$ , and some of the websites say that it's a number without a fractional component. Then what is a fractional component? I took a course on Algebra and we defined them as equivalence classes... but to obtain that, it would require the knowledge of basic things like $1$ is the least positive integer. So I'm getting stuck in this loop. Here's what the textbook says. Proof. (as in textbook) Suppose there is a positive integer a between $0$ and $1$ . Let $S = \\{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+ | 0 < n < 1\\}$ . Since $0 < a < 1$ , $a \\in S$ , so $S$ is nonempty. Therefore, by the well-ordering principle, $S$ has a least element $l$ , where $0 < l < 1$ . Then $0 < l^2 < l$ , so $l^2 \\in S$ . But $l^2$ < $l$ , which contradicts our assumption that $l$ is a least element of $S$ . Thus, there are no positive integers between $0$ and $1$ . However, we have no definition of $l^2$ (and we can't say anything about its order). I'm just simply not getting convinced by this proof. Can someone help?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I think this is a weird example chosen to illustrate the version of induction that uses the well ordering of the positive integers. That means you can assume whatever you need about arithmetic, including squaring, and the fact that for  real numbers $a < 1$ implies $a^2 < a$. Then, as the argument says, the square of some (hypothetical) integer between $0$ and $1$ will be less than $a$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question according to the given format. First, I need to understand the original question and the textbook's proof. The main goal is to prove there's no positive integer between 0 and 1. The user is confused about the proof provided, especially regarding the definition of integers and the step involving l².\n\nSo, the original problem is to prove that there's no positive integer between 0 and 1. The textbook uses the well-ordering principle. Let's parse the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe assumptions here would be based on what's given in the problem. The textbook assumes the well-ordering principle applies to the set S of positive integers between 0 and 1. Then, by supposing such an integer exists, they derive a contradiction by finding a smaller element l² in S. However, the user is confused because they think the definition of l² isn't established, and maybe the properties of integers aren't clearly defined here.\n\nIn the example provided, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the key assumptions would relate to the properties of positive integers and the well-ordering principle. Let me list them:\n\n1. The well-ordering principle applies to nonempty sets of positive integers. (Every nonempty set of positive integers has a least element.)\n2. The positive integers are closed under multiplication. (So, if l is a positive integer, then l² is also a positive integer.)\n3. For positive integers a and b, if a < b, then a² < b². (But in this case, since 0 < l < 1, multiplying both sides by l would give 0 < l² < l. However, this assumes that multiplying an inequality by a positive number preserves the inequality, which is true in real numbers, but we need to ensure that this holds for integers. Wait, but if l is a positive integer less than 1, then l must be 0, which contradicts. Wait, but the assumption is that such an l exists between 0 and 1. However, in integers, if there's an integer between 0 and 1, it would have to be 0 < l < 1, but in integers, there's no such number. So, the proof by contradiction is showing that if such an l exists, then l² is smaller and also in S, which contradicts the well-ordering principle.\n\nBut the user's confusion is about the definitions. The problem is to prove there's no positive integer between 0 and 1. The textbook's proof uses the well-ordering principle and the closure under multiplication. So the assumptions here are:\n\n- The set of positive integers is well-ordered.\n- The product of two positive integers is a positive integer.\n- If 0 < l < 1 (in integers), then multiplying both sides by l (a positive integer) would result in 0 < l² < l.\n\nBut wait, in integers, if l is a positive integer between 0 and 1, then l must be 1, but 1 is not less than 1. So actually, the assumption is that such an l exists, which leads to a contradiction because l² would then be a smaller positive integer in S.\n\nSo for the structured problem, the assumptions would include the well-ordering principle, closure under multiplication, and the properties of inequalities. But in the example given, the assumptions were more about the conditions on n. Here, the problem is to structure the problem as per the user's example. The original problem's assumptions might be:\n\n- The set of positive integers is well-ordered.\n- Multiplication of positive integers is closed (product is a positive integer).\n- If a positive integer l exists such that 0 < l < 1, then l² is also a positive integer and 0 < l² < l.\n\nBut maybe in the problem statement, the key assumptions are already part of the proof. The user is supposed to list all assumptions in the problem. Wait, in the example given, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So here, the problem is to prove no positive integer exists between 0 and 1, and the assumptions would be the properties needed for the proof.\n\nLooking back at the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, but in the formatted problem, the assumption was n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem's assumptions would be the well-ordering principle (since the proof uses it), and that the integers are closed under multiplication. However, the problem might not explicitly state these, but as per the user's instruction, we need to list the assumptions.\n\nBut perhaps the problem as stated in the textbook doesn't list these assumptions; they are part of the mathematical framework. However, the user wants the assumptions line by line. Let's think: in the problem, the key steps are:\n\n1. Suppose there exists a positive integer a with 0 < a < 1.\n2. Define S as the set of such integers.\n3. S is nonempty, so by well-ordering principle, S has a least element l.\n4. Then l² is in S and less than l, which is a contradiction.\n\nThe assumptions required here are:\n\n- The well-ordering principle applies to any nonempty subset of positive integers.\n- The product of two positive integers is a positive integer (so l² is an integer).\n- If 0 < l < 1, then l² < l (this relies on the property that multiplying both sides of an inequality by a positive number preserves the inequality, but in integers, since l is a positive integer, but if l is between 0 and 1, which isn't possible unless l is not an integer, which is the contradiction).\n\nWait, but in integers, if there is an integer l with 0 < l < 1, then l must be a fractional number, which contradicts the definition of integers. However, the proof is showing that even if such an integer existed, it would lead to a contradiction. But the user is confused about the definitions, particularly the definition of integers. So perhaps the assumptions include:\n\n- The set of positive integers is closed under multiplication.\n- The well-ordering principle holds for the set of positive integers.\n- For any positive integer l, if 0 < l < 1, then l² is also a positive integer and 0 < l² < l.\n\nBut maybe the key assumptions are the well-ordering principle and the closure under multiplication. However, in the problem statement, these are considered standard properties. But according to the user's example, the assumptions were specific conditions on n. Here, the problem's assumptions might not be explicitly stated in the problem, but necessary for the proof.\n\nAlternatively, the problem as posed in the textbook might not list these as assumptions because they are part of the standard axioms, but according to the user's format, we need to list all the assumptions. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- The set of positive integers satisfies the well-ordering principle.\n- The product of two positive integers is a positive integer.\n- For any positive integer l, if 0 < l < 1, then l² is a positive integer and 0 < l² < l.\n\nBut the third assumption might be derived from the first two. However, in the user's example, they listed assumptions applied to one object each. For example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, maybe:\n\nAssumption 1: The set of positive integers is well-ordered.\nAssumption 2: The product of two positive integers is a positive integer.\nAssumption 3: For any positive integer l, if 0 < l < 1, then l² < l.\n\nBut the third one might be a consequence of multiplication properties. However, the user wants each assumption to address one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe set of positive integers satisfies the well-ordering principle.\nMultiplication of positive integers is closed (product is a positive integer).\nIf a positive integer l satisfies 0 < l < 1, then l² is a positive integer and l² < l.\n\nBut these need to be separate lines. Wait, the example had two assumptions, each on a separate line. So here, we might have:\n\nAssumption:\nThe set of positive integers is well-ordered.\nPositive integers are closed under multiplication.\nFor any positive integer l, 0 < l < 1 implies l² is a positive integer.\nFor any positive integer l, 0 < l < 1 implies l² < l.\n\nBut this might be splitting hairs. Alternatively, since the closure under multiplication is a general property, and the inequality l² < l comes from multiplying the inequality 0 < l < 1 by l (assuming l is positive). However, in integers, if l is a positive integer, l ≥ 1. So, if you suppose l is between 0 and 1, then multiplying by l (which would be a positive fraction less than 1 in real numbers) would make it smaller. But since we're in integers, this step might be assuming properties from real numbers, which the user is questioning.\n\nBut the problem is that the user is confused about the definitions. The textbook's proof seems to use properties of real numbers (like multiplying inequalities) applied to integers. But the key point is that in integers, there is no such element, so assuming there is one leads to a contradiction.\n\nBut according to the user's required format, the assumptions are the ones given in the problem. However, the problem as stated in the textbook doesn't list assumptions—it's a proof by contradiction using the well-ordering principle. So perhaps the assumptions needed for the problem are:\n\n- The well-ordering principle applies to nonempty subsets of positive integers.\n- The product of two positive integers is a positive integer.\n- The ordering of integers is compatible with multiplication (i.e., if 0 < a < b and c > 0, then ac < bc).\n\nBut again, these are general properties of integers. However, the user wants to filter unrelated information and structure the problem. In the example, the original problem had an expression involving 5^n, 6^n, etc., and the formatted problem listed the assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7.\n\nIn the current problem, the key assumptions used in the proof are:\n\n1. The well-ordering principle applies to any nonempty set of positive integers.\n2. If there exists a positive integer a such that 0 < a < 1, then the set S = {n ∈ ℤ⁺ | 0 < n < 1} is nonempty.\n3. For such an a in S, its square a² is also a positive integer.\n4. The square of a number between 0 and 1 is less than the original number (0 < a < 1 ⇒ a² < a).\n\nBut points 3 and 4 might be the assumptions. However, in the integers, if a is a positive integer, a ≥ 1, so a² ≥ a. But if we suppose a is between 0 and 1, then in real numbers, a² < a, but in integers, such a can't exist. The proof uses this contradiction.\n\nThus, the assumptions for the problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe well-ordering principle applies to nonempty subsets of positive integers.\nPositive integers are closed under multiplication.\nFor any positive integer l, if 0 < l < 1, then l² is a positive integer and l² < l.\n\nBut actually, the third assumption is combining two things: closure (l² is a positive integer) and the inequality (l² < l). Maybe split them:\n\nAssumption:\nThe set of positive integers is well-ordered.\nPositive integers are closed under multiplication.\nFor any positive integer l, if 0 < l < 1, then l² < l.\n\nBut the problem is that the closure under multiplication is part of the definition of integers. However, the user is struggling with the definitions. The key point here is to structure the problem as per the example. The problem is to prove there's no positive integer between 0 and 1. The textbook uses these assumptions implicitly.\n\nSo, applying the format:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nThe set of positive integers is well-ordered.\nPositive integers are closed under multiplication.\nFor any positive integer $l$, if $0 < l < 1$, then $l^2$ is a positive integer and $l^2 < l$.\nProblem: Prove that there is no positive integer between $0$ and $1$.\n###\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumptions were specific to the problem's variables. Here, the assumptions are more about general principles. However, the original problem might not state these assumptions, but the user wants them extracted. Alternatively, perhaps the key assumption is the well-ordering principle, which is used in the proof. The other points are properties of integers. But given the example, maybe the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nThere exists a positive integer $a$ such that $0 < a < 1$.\nThe set $S = \\{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+ \\mid 0 < n < 1\\}$ is nonempty.\nBy the well-ordering principle, $S$ has a least element $l$.\n\nWait, but these are steps in the proof, not assumptions of the problem. The actual assumptions are the well-ordering principle and closure under multiplication. But the user's example had assumptions about the variable n. In this problem, the main assumption leading to contradiction is the existence of such an integer a. But the problem is to prove there is no such integer, so the assumption for contradiction is that there exists one, but that's part of the proof, not the problem's assumptions.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let me re-express the problem as per the example.\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that there is no positive integer between 0 and 1.\n\nIn the example, the formatted problem included the assumptions from the problem. The example's original problem had the expression with n, and the formatted problem listed assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7.\n\nIn the current problem, the original problem is to prove no positive integer exists between 0 and 1. The proof uses the well-ordering principle and properties of multiplication. So the assumptions needed for the proof are:\n\n- The well-ordering principle (applied to positive integers).\n- Positive integers are closed under multiplication.\n- If 0 < l < 1 (for a positive integer l), then l² < l.\n\nBut these are general properties, not specific to the problem. However, in the example, the assumptions were specific to the variable n. Here, perhaps the only assumption is that we're considering positive integers, but the problem itself is the statement to prove.\n\nWait, maybe the user's example was different. The original problem had \"Prove that for every integer n...\", and the formatted problem listed assumptions about n. Here, the problem is about positive integers in general, so perhaps the assumptions are about the properties of positive integers (well-ordering, closure under multiplication), and the ordering.\n\nBut according to the user's instructions, the assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing only one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo, structuring the current problem:\n\nAssumption:\nThe set of positive integers is well-ordered.\nMultiplication of two positive integers results in a positive integer.\nFor any positive integer $l$, if $0 < l < 1$, then $l^2 < l$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there is no positive integer between $0$ and $1$.\n\nBut perhaps the third assumption is redundant because it's derived from the first two. However, in the proof, they use that l² is in S and l² < l, which requires both closure and the inequality.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem doesn't require listing the well-ordering principle as an assumption because it's a standard axiom in number theory. But the user's example included divisibility by 7 as an assumption, which was part of the problem's conditions. Here, since the proof relies on the well-ordering principle, which might not be an assumption but an axiom, but the user wants all assumptions listed.\n\nGiven the user's example included an assumption about n being divisible by 7, which was part of the problem's condition, here the key assumption is the well-ordering principle, which is used in the proof, but the problem itself is to prove no integer exists between 0 and 1. Therefore, the formatted problem should list the assumptions used in the proof, even if they're general principles.\n\nBut to match the example, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nThe set of positive integers satisfies the well-ordering principle.\nPositive integers are closed under multiplication.\nFor any positive integer $l$, $0 < l < 1$ implies $l^2$ is a positive integer and $l^2 < l$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there is no positive integer between $0$ and $1$.\n\nBut the third assumption is combining two things: closure (l² is integer) and inequality (l² < l). To adhere to the format, each assumption should be one line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe set of positive integers is well-ordered.\nMultiplication of positive integers is closed.\nFor any positive integer $l$, $0 < l < 1$ implies $l^2 < l$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there is no positive integer between $0$ and $1$.\n\nBut again, the third assumption is a property that might be derived from other axioms. However, given the user's example, which split the assumptions into separate lines, even if they are related, this should be acceptable.",
