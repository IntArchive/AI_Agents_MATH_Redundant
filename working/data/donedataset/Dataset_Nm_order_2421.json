    "Content": "Prove that a cyclic group that has only one generator has at most $2$ elements. I want to know if my proof would be valid: Suppose $G$ is a cyclic group and $g$ is its only generator. Let $|G|=n$ where $n>2$ , then we know that $\\gcd(n,n-1)=1$ . This implies that $g^{n-1}$ is a generator of $G$ . We have a contradiction, since $g$ is the only generator of $G$ (and $n > 2$ leads to $n-1 \\neq 1$ ). Thus $|G|\\leq 2$ . I tried to use the fact that generating elements of a group are coprime to the order of the group, thanks.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Perhaps easier: if $g$ generates $G$ , then so does $g^{-1}$ . The hypothesis then implies that $g=g^{-1}$ , so $g^2=1$ . Done (either $g=1$ or not, in which case respectively the order of $G$ is $1$ or $2$ ).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify the key assumptions and the main problem statement from the original question.\n\nThe original problem is about proving that a cyclic group with only one generator has at most 2 elements. The user provided their own proof attempt, but my task is to extract the assumptions and problem statement, not evaluate the proof.\n\nLooking at the question: \"Prove that a cyclic group that has only one generator has at most 2 elements.\" The assumptions here are inherent in the problem statement. The group is cyclic, which is a given condition. The group has only one generator, which is another key assumption. The problem is to show that such a group cannot have more than 2 elements.\n\nNow, checking the example provided, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. In the example, the assumptions were about the integer n and its divisibility by 7. Translating that to this problem, the assumptions should be about the group being cyclic and having only one generator.\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem mentioned that n is an integer, but the formatted assumption included both that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. However, in the original problem here, the user's proof attempt mentions that the group has order n > 2 and uses gcd(n, n-1)=1. But these might be part of the proof, not the problem's assumptions. The actual problem's assumptions are just that the group is cyclic and has only one generator. The problem statement is to prove the group has at most 2 elements.\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer, which was part of the problem's premise. The user then added another assumption that n is divisible by 7, but wait, looking back, the original problem in the example was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem had an assumption that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but that's actually part of the problem's conclusion? Wait, maybe there was a mistake in the example. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is that n is any integer. However, the formatted problem includes \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Wait, perhaps the example was a typo or an error. Because if the original problem is for every integer n, then the assumption shouldn't restrict n to being divisible by 7. Unless there's a misinterpretation.\n\nBut maybe the example was from a different problem. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. Regardless, the instruction says that in the formatted problem, the assumptions should list all the conditions given in the problem. For the cyclic group problem, the given conditions are that the group is cyclic and that it has only one generator. The problem is to prove that such a group has at most 2 elements.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n- G is a cyclic group.\n- G has exactly one generator.\n\nThe problem statement is to prove that G has at most 2 elements.\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, and the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems conflicting. Maybe the example was incorrect, but I need to follow the user's instruction regardless.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question states: \"Prove that a cyclic group that has only one generator has at most 2 elements.\" So the assumptions are:\n\n1. G is a cyclic group.\n2. G has exactly one generator.\n\nProblem: Prove that G has at most 2 elements.\n\nBut wait, the user's proof attempt mentions |G| = n where n > 2, leading to a contradiction. However, that's part of the proof process, not the problem's assumptions.\n\nSo, structuring the problem as per the user's example, we need to list all the assumptions given in the problem, not those introduced in the proof. Therefore, the correct assumptions are that G is cyclic and has only one generator. The problem is to show |G| ≤ 2.\n\nBut looking back at the example, in the original problem, the user wrote \"Prove that for every integer n...\", and in the formatted problem, the assumptions included \"n is an integer\", which is part of the problem's premise. So following that, here, the assumptions would be:\n\n- G is a cyclic group.\n- G has exactly one generator.\n\nProblem: Prove that G has at most 2 elements.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Each assumption is one line, one property. The first line states G is cyclic, the second states it has one generator. The problem is to prove the conclusion.",
