    "Content": "Someone claimed that a number, multiplied by the number after it plus 17 is always prime, and showed several cases. I'm not a complete amateur in Number Theory, and I know that $17*18+17=17*19$, so it does not work for $n\\equiv0(\\mod17)$ but does it always work for other $n$ values? If not, can someone give me a counter example that I can show that person so they can correct their statement?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Good. Note that both $17$ and $4 \\cdot 17 - 1 = 67$ are prime, and the positive binary quadratic form $$  x^2 + x y + 17 y^2 $$ is in a discriminant ($-67$) of only one equivalence class of forms. So, the 1913 theorem of Rabinowitz shows that the values of $n^2 + n + 17$ must be prime for $0 \\leq n \\leq 15.$ I give a proof of both directions of Rabinowitz (1913) at Is the notorious $n^2 + n + 41$ prime generator the last of its type? Here are the first 100 composite $n^2 + n + 17$ that are not divisible by $17.$ Note that all prime factors $p$ of these must have either $p=67$ or Legendre symbol $(p|67)=1.$ n       n^2 + n + 17\n

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user is asking about numbers of the form n² + n + 17 and whether they're always prime, especially when n isn't a multiple of 17. The original claim was that multiplying a number by the next one and adding 17 always gives a prime, but they noticed that when n is 17, it's 17*19, which is composite. So they want to know if there are other values of n where this fails, specifically non-multiples of 17.\n\nFirst, I need to recall that the polynomial n² + n + 17 is famous because it generates primes for n from 0 to 15. Euler found this, right? It's one of those prime-generating polynomials. But of course, no polynomial can generate primes forever. So the question is, besides n being a multiple of 17, are there other n values where n² + n +17 is composite?\n\nLet me check n=16. Let's compute 16² +16 +17. 16² is 256, plus 16 is 272, plus 17 is 289. Wait, 289 is 17². So when n=16, the result is 17², which is composite. But 16 isn't a multiple of 17. So that's a counterexample. But wait, is 16 congruent to 0 mod 17? No, 16 mod 17 is 16. So here's a case where n isn't a multiple of 17, yet the expression is composite.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned n ≡ 0 mod 17. So their example was n=17, which gives 17*18 +17 =17*19. But n=16 gives 289=17², which is also composite. So even when n isn't a multiple of 17, the expression can be composite. Therefore, the answer is that there are counterexamples where n isn't a multiple of 17. For example, n=16 gives 289, which is 17 squared.\n\nBut maybe the user wants the smallest such example. The original polynomial generates primes from n=0 to 15, but at n=16, it fails. So that's a clear counterexample. Therefore, the answer should include n=16 as a counterexample. Additionally, there might be others. For example, n=17 is 17*19, n=16 is 17², and perhaps n=32 or others. But the simplest one is n=16.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions here are that n is an integer, and the problem is to determine if numbers of the form n² +n +17 are always prime when n is not a multiple of 17. The answer is no, with n=16 being a counterexample. So the formatted problem should list the assumptions and the problem as stated.",
