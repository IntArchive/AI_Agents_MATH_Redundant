    "Content": "Prove that if two sets $A$ and $B$ are compact then so is their Cartesian product $A \\times B = \\{(a,b): a \\in A, b\\in B\\}$. The hint is to use Bolzano Weiertrass theorem and an argument of sequence to proof the statement.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "A set $S$ is compact if from any sequence of elements in $S$ you can extract a sub-sequence with a limit in $S$ . If we are given a sequence $(u_n)$ of $A \\times B$ , then you can write $u_n=(a_n,b_n)$ . Since $A$ is compact, you can find a sub-sequence $(a_{f(n)})$ with a limit in $A$ . Then, since B is also compact, you can extract a sub-sequence $(b_{f(g(n))})$ of $(b_{f(n)})$ with a limit in B. Thus, the sub-sequence $(u_{f(g(n))})$ of $(u_n)$ has its limit in $A \\times B$ . This proves that $A \\times B$ is compact. I hope that you can understand my explanation, as I am still learning English.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original question is about proving that the Cartesian product of two compact sets A and B is compact, using the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem and a sequence argument.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions. The problem states that A and B are compact. So each of these should be a separate assumption. The problem mentions their Cartesian product A × B, but that's part of the conclusion, not an assumption. The hint suggests using Bolzano-Weierstrass and sequences, but those are part of the proof method, not assumptions.\n\nSo the assumptions should be:\n1. A is a compact set.\n2. B is a compact set.\n\nThe problem is to prove that A × B is compact. The user's example didn't include the hint in the problem statement, just the actual problem. So the problem part should be the statement to prove, without the hint. The hint is part of the original question but not part of the formatted problem's assumptions or the problem statement itself.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included that n is divisible by 7, even though the original problem didn't state that. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, maybe the user's example was incorrect? Let me check.\n\nLooking back at the example: the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Because the original problem didn't have the divisibility by 7 as a condition. Wait, maybe the example was for a different problem? Or perhaps there was an error. The user might have intended to show that in some cases, assumptions need to be extracted even if they are implicit. But in this case, the problem to structure is the Cartesian product one.\n\nSo, returning to the current problem. The original question is: Prove that if two sets A and B are compact then so is their Cartesian product A × B. The hint is about using Bolzano-Weierstrass and sequences. The user's format requires listing each assumption line by line, each applying to one object. So the assumptions are that A is compact and B is compact. The problem is to prove that A × B is compact.\n\nTherefore, the formatted answer should be:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a compact set,\nB is a compact set.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the Cartesian product $A \\times B = \\{(a,b): a \\in A, b\\in B\\}$ is compact.\n\nI need to ensure that each assumption is on a separate line, only one property per line, applied to one object. So \"A is compact\" and \"B is compact\" are two separate assumptions. The problem is the statement to prove. The hint about Bolzano-Weierstrass and sequences is part of the original question's context but not part of the formatted problem. The user's example didn't include the hint in the problem statement, so we omit that here as well.",
