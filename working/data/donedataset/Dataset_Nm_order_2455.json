    "Content": "Given that n is a positive integer show that $\\gcd(n^3 + 1, n^2 + 2) = 1$, $3$, or $9$. I'm thinking that I should be using the property of gcd that says if a and b are integers then gcd(a,b) = gcd(a+cb,b). So I can do things like decide that $\\gcd(n^3 + 1, n^2 + 2) = \\gcd((n^3+1) - n(n^2+2),n^2+2) = \\gcd(1-2n,n^2+2)$ and then using Bezout's theorem I can get $\\gcd(1-2n,n^2+2)= r(1-2n) + s(n^2 +2)$ and I can expand this to $r(1-2n) + s(n^2 +2) = r - 2rn + sn^2 + 2s$ However after some time of chasing this path using various substitutions and factorings I've gotten nowhere. Can anybody provide a hint as to how I should be looking at this problem?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "As you note, $\\gcd(n^3+1,n^2+2) = \\gcd(1-2n,n^2+2)$. Now, continuing in that manner,\n$$\\begin{align*}\n\\gcd(1-2n, n^2+2) &= \\gcd(2n-1,n^2+2)\\\\\n &= \\gcd(2n-1, n^2+2+2n-1)\\\\\n &= \\gcd(2n-1,n^2+2n+1)\\\\\n &= \\gcd(2n-1,(n+1)^2).\n\\end{align*}$$ Consider now $\\gcd(2n-1,n+1)$. We have:\n$$\\begin{align*}\n\\gcd(2n-1,n+1) &= \\gcd(n-2,n+1) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(n-2,n+1-(n-2))\\\\\n&=\\gcd(n-2,3)\\\\\n &= 1\\text{ or }3.\n\\end{align*}$$ \nTherefore, the gcd of $2n-1$ and $(n+1)^2$ is either $1$, $3$, or $9$. Hence the same is true of the original gcd.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. The problem is to show that for any positive integer n, the greatest common divisor (gcd) of n³ + 1 and n² + 2 is either 1, 3, or 9. \n\nFirst, I remember that the gcd of two numbers can be found using the Euclidean algorithm, which involves repeatedly applying the division algorithm to reduce the problem into smaller parts. The user mentioned using the property that gcd(a, b) = gcd(a - c*b, b) for any integer c. Let me try applying that here.\n\nStarting with gcd(n³ + 1, n² + 2). If I subtract n times the second term from the first term, that should help reduce the degree. So:\n\ngcd(n³ + 1, n² + 2) = gcd(n³ + 1 - n*(n² + 2), n² + 2)\nCalculating the first term: n³ + 1 - n³ - 2n = 1 - 2n. So now the gcd is gcd(1 - 2n, n² + 2).\n\nAlright, so now we have to find gcd(1 - 2n, n² + 2). Let's call this d. So d divides both 1 - 2n and n² + 2. Therefore, d must divide any linear combination of these two. Maybe we can express n² + 2 in terms of (1 - 2n). Let me see. Let's try to eliminate n. If d divides 1 - 2n, then 2n ≡ 1 mod d. So n ≡ (1/2) mod d. Hmm, but n must be an integer, so (1/2) mod d must also correspond to some integer. Alternatively, maybe I can substitute n from the congruence into the second equation.\n\nSince 2n ≡ 1 mod d, then n ≡ (1/2) mod d. Let's plug this into n² + 2 ≡ 0 mod d. So:\n\n( (1/2) )² + 2 ≡ 0 mod d\nWhich simplifies to 1/4 + 2 ≡ 0 mod d\nMultiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction:\n1 + 8 ≡ 0 mod d\nSo 9 ≡ 0 mod d, which means d divides 9. Therefore, the possible values for d are the divisors of 9, which are 1, 3, and 9. \n\nWait, that seems to align with the problem's conclusion. So the gcd must be 1, 3, or 9. But we need to verify that all these cases are possible, i.e., there exist n such that the gcd is 1, 3, or 9. Let me check a few examples.\n\nTake n = 1:\nn³ + 1 = 2\nn² + 2 = 3\ngcd(2, 3) = 1. Okay.\n\nTake n = 2:\nn³ + 1 = 9\nn² + 2 = 6\ngcd(9, 6) = 3. Good.\n\nTake n = 4:\nn³ + 1 = 65\nn² + 2 = 18\ngcd(65, 18) = 1. Hmm, another 1.\n\nWait, when does the gcd become 9? Let's try n = 5:\nn³ +1 = 126\nn² +2 = 27\ngcd(126,27) = 9. There we go. So n=5 gives gcd 9.\n\nTherefore, the possible gcds are indeed 1, 3, or 9. So the key step was realizing that after reducing using the Euclidean algorithm, the gcd must divide 9, hence the possible values. The user might have gotten stuck trying to use Bézout's identity directly, but substituting the congruence leads to the conclusion more straightforwardly. I should structure the problem by identifying the assumptions and the problem statement as per the required format.",
