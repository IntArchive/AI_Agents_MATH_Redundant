    "Content": "Denote $H(p) = -p \\log_2 p - (1-p)\\log_2(1-p)$ [Shannon entropy]. It is well-known that $H$ is a concave function that increases on $(0,\\frac{1}{2})$ and decreases on $(\\frac{1}{2}, 1)$ . Let $\\beta, \\beta_1, \\beta_2 \\in (0,\\frac{1}{2})$ be real numbers such that $ H(\\beta_1) + H(\\beta_2) = 2 H(\\beta).$ Let $r$ be a positive real number such that all values $\\beta_1 + r, \\beta_2 + r,\\beta + r$ are less than $\\frac{1}{2}$ . How to prove the following inequality? $$ H(\\beta_1 + r - 2\\beta_1 r) + H(\\beta_2 + r - 2\\beta_2 r) \\ge 2H(\\beta + r - 2\\beta r)$$ UPD: Why I know that this inequality holds? Because it follows from rather deep result in Kolmogorov complexity theory . But I hope there is a simpler proof of this fact:)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Nice result, it leads me to something wanted to craft but didn't. I will prove a better result Proposition 1 Let $\\beta, \\beta_1, \\beta_2 \\in (0,\\frac{1}{2})$ be real numbers such that $ H(\\beta_1) + H(\\beta_2) = 2 H(\\beta).$ Then for all $r \\in (0,1)$ , we have: $$ H(\\beta_1 + r - 2\\beta_1 r) + H(\\beta_2 + r - 2\\beta_2 r) \\ge 2H(\\beta + r - 2\\beta r)$$ Before going into details, I give one comparison lemma. Lemma 2 (A lemma comparing convexity) Let $G$ and $g$ be two differentiable functions from a same domain $[a,b]$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ . Suppose that $G'$ is strictly positive and that the function $s \\mapsto \\frac{g'(s)}{G'(s)}$ is increasing with $s$ , then i) For all number $s,t,v \\in (a,b)$ such that $G(s)+G(t)=2G(v)$ , we have: $$g(s)+g(t) \\ge 2g(v)$$ ii) $s \\mapsto \\frac{g(s)-g(b)}{G(s)-G(b)}$ is an increasing function. Demonstration i) Let $D=[G(a),G(b)]$ and let us consider the function $f(x)=g(G^{-1}(x))$ on $D$ . Clearly, $f'(x)=\\frac{g'(G^{-1}(x))}{G'(G^{-1}(x))}=\\left(\\frac{g'}{G}\\circ G^{-1}\\right)(x)$ is a composition of two increasing function hence $f'(x)$ is increasing, which means $f$ is a convex function i.e $$f(x)+f(y) \\ge 2 f \\left( \\frac{x+y}{2}\\right)$$ for all $x,y \\in D$ . Now choosing $x=G(s), y= G(t)$ , we have our conclusion. ii) For any $a\\le s <t <b$ , by Cauchy's MVT, there are two real numbers $p \\in (s,t) , q \\in (t,b)$ such that: $$\\frac{g(s)-g(t)}{G(s)-G(t) }=\\frac{g'}{G'}(p) \\quad \\frac{g(t)-g(b)}{G(t)-G(b) }=\\frac{g'}{G'}(q)$$ Thus $$\\begin{align}\\frac{g(s)-g(b)}{G(s)-G(b)} &= \\left(\\frac{G(t)-G(s)}{G(b)-G(s)}\\right) \\frac{g'}{G'}(p)+\\left(\\frac{G(b)-G(t)}{G(b)-G(s)}\\right)\\frac{g'}{G'}(q)\\\\&\\le \\frac{g'}{G'}(q) = \\frac{g(t)-g(b)}{G(t)-G(b) }\n\\end{align}$$ because of the monotonicity of $\\frac{g'}{G}$ and the fact that $p<q$ . Hence the conclusion. $\\square$ Back to the demonstration of our Proposition 1 . Demonstration for the Proposition 1 Choosing $h(p)= H( r+p-2pr)$ . Note that $H'$ is strictly positive on $(0,1/2)$ (the boundary doesn't matter), based on the first of our lemma, what we need to do is to prove that $x \\mapsto \\frac{h'}{H'}(x)$ is an increasing function. Then again, by noticing that $h'(1/2)=H'(1/2)=0$ , based on the second part of our lemma, what we have to prove is that $\\frac{h''}{H''}$ is an increasing function (we considered $G=-H', g=-h'$ for the second part of the lemma). And clearly, $$\\begin{align}\\frac{h''}{H''}(p)&=(1-2r)^2\\frac{\\frac{1}{(r+p-2rp)(1-r-p+2p)}}{\\frac{1}{p(1-p)}}\n=(1-2r)^2\\frac{1-(2p-1)^2}{1-(2r-1)^2(2p-1)^2}\\\\\n&=1+\\frac{(2r-1)^2-1}{1-(2r-1)^2(1-2p)^2}\n=1-\\frac{4r(1-r)}{1-(2r-1)^2(1-2p)^2}\n\\end{align}$$ is an increasing function $[0,1/2]$ as long as $ r \\in [0,1]$ . $\\square$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse the original question and extract the necessary information while filtering out any unrelated details. The user wants the assumptions listed clearly and the problem statement restructured.\n\nStarting with the title: \"An entropy inequality.\" So the main goal is to prove an inequality involving Shannon entropy. The question defines the Shannon entropy H(p) with the standard formula. Then it mentions some properties of H: concave, increasing on (0, 1/2), decreasing on (1/2, 1). \n\nNext, the assumptions given are that β, β₁, β₂ are in (0, 1/2), and they satisfy H(β₁) + H(β₂) = 2H(β). There's also a positive real number r such that β₁ + r, β₂ + r, and β + r are all less than 1/2. The inequality to prove is H(β₁ + r - 2β₁r) + H(β₂ + r - 2β₂r) ≥ 2H(β + r - 2βr).\n\nThe user mentions an update that it follows from Kolmogorov complexity but wants a simpler proof. However, that's part of the original problem's context, so maybe not needed in the structured format.\n\nNow, listing assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition for one object. Let's see:\n\n1. H(p) is the Shannon entropy: H(p) = -p log₂ p - (1-p) log₂(1-p). This is the definition, so that's one assumption.\n\n2. H is concave. Stated as a general property.\n\n3. H increases on (0, 1/2) and decreases on (1/2, 1). This is two properties, but the problem states it as one sentence. However, the user's example splits each condition. Wait, in the example, they had separate lines for each condition. But here, the increasing and decreasing are on different intervals. Should they be separate? Let me check the example. In the example, the assumption was split into two: \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" So here, perhaps split into H is concave, H increases on (0,1/2), H decreases on (1/2,1). But the original problem states \"H is a concave function that increases on (0,1/2) and decreases on (1/2,1).\" However, the user's example separates each condition. So maybe list each property separately. But in this case, concavity is one property, monotonicity on intervals are two more. However, the problem might require concavity and the increasing/decreasing behavior as separate assumptions.\n\nThen, the variables: β, β₁, β₂ are in (0, 1/2). Each should be listed as separate assumptions? But they are all in the same interval, so maybe one assumption: β, β₁, β₂ ∈ (0, 1/2). But according to the example, each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. Wait, in the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are separate, even though both apply to n. So here, maybe separate each variable's condition? But β, β₁, β₂ are all in the same interval. Maybe one assumption listing all three variables in that interval. Hmm. Let me check the user's example again. In the example, the first assumption is \"n is an integer,\" which applies to n. Then \"n is divisible by 7,\" again for n. So here, the variables β, β₁, β₂ are three different objects. So perhaps three separate assumptions: β ∈ (0, 1/2), β₁ ∈ (0, 1/2), β₂ ∈ (0, 1/2). But the original problem says \"β, β₁, β₂ ∈ (0, 1/2)\" as one statement. Maybe better to list them as separate lines? The user's example uses \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7,\" which are two separate conditions on the same object. Here, each of β, β₁, β₂ is a different object but with the same condition. Maybe list them all in one line: β, β₁, β₂ ∈ (0, 1/2). Then the next condition is H(β₁) + H(β₂) = 2H(β). Then r is a positive real number. Then β₁ + r < 1/2, β₂ + r < 1/2, β + r < 1/2. Each of these could be separate assumptions. So:\n\nAssumption:\nH(p) = -p log₂ p - (1-p) log₂(1-p),\nH is concave,\nH increases on (0, 1/2),\nH decreases on (1/2, 1),\nβ ∈ (0, 1/2),\nβ₁ ∈ (0, 1/2),\nβ₂ ∈ (0, 1/2),\nH(β₁) + H(β₂) = 2 H(β),\nr is a positive real number,\nβ₁ + r < 1/2,\nβ₂ + r < 1/2,\nβ + r < 1/2.\n\nBut wait, the original problem states \"all values β₁ + r, β₂ + r, β + r are less than 1/2.\" So that's one condition, but in the example, each condition is split. The user's example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate lines. So here, perhaps split into three lines: β₁ + r < 1/2, β₂ + r < 1/2, β + r < 1/2. Similarly, r being positive is a separate assumption.\n\nSo compiling all that, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nH(p) is defined as -p log₂ p - (1-p) log₂(1-p),\nH is concave,\nH increases on the interval (0, 1/2),\nH decreases on the interval (1/2, 1),\nβ is a real number in (0, 1/2),\nβ₁ is a real number in (0, 1/2),\nβ₂ is a real number in (0, 1/2),\nH(β₁) + H(β₂) = 2 H(β),\nr is a positive real number,\nβ₁ + r is less than 1/2,\nβ₂ + r is less than 1/2,\nβ + r is less than 1/2.\n\nThen the problem is to prove the inequality given.\n\nBut let me check the original problem statement again. It says \"Let β, β₁, β₂ ∈ (0,1/2) be real numbers such that H(β₁) + H(β₂) = 2 H(β). Let r be a positive real number such that all values β₁ + r, β₂ + r, β + r are less than 1/2.\" So the variables are given with those conditions. So the conditions on β, β₁, β₂ being in (0,1/2) are separate from the equation involving H. Then r being positive and the sum with r being less than 1/2.\n\nTherefore, structuring the assumptions as per the user's example, each line is one condition on one object.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nH(p) = -p log₂ p - (1-p) log₂(1-p),\nH is a concave function,\nH increases on (0, 1/2),\nH decreases on (1/2, 1),\nβ ∈ (0, 1/2),\nβ₁ ∈ (0, 1/2),\nβ₂ ∈ (0, 1/2),\nH(β₁) + H(β₂) = 2 H(β),\nr is a positive real number,\nβ₁ + r < 1/2,\nβ₂ + r < 1/2,\nβ + r < 1/2.\n\nProblem: Prove that\nH(β₁ + r - 2β₁r) + H(β₂ + r - 2β₂r) ≥ 2 H(β + r - 2β r).\n\nI think that's correct. Each assumption is a single condition on a single object. Even though the first four lines are about H, each is a separate property. Then the variables β, β₁, β₂ each have their own line for being in (0,1/2). Then the equation H sum, then r's positivity, then each sum with r being less than 1/2.\n\nYes, this seems to fit the user's example structure.",
