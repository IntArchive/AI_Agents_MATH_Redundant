    "Content": "Theorem 1.20(b) on page 9 of Rudin's \"Principles of Mathematical Analysis,\" 3rd edition. For those without the text handy: 1.20 Theorem (a) If $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $x > 0$ , then there is a positive integer $n$ such that $nx > y$ . (b) If $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ , $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$ , and $x < y$ , then there exists a $p \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ such that $x < p < y$ . Also a picture to the page in question: https://i.sstatic.net/U8hgO.png We are given that $x < y$ , thus $y - x > 0$ is obvious to me. I quickly lose Rudin after this step. I understand that the archimedean property $(a)$ is being used for the next line, where it says $n(y - x) > 1$ , however I have no clue where the number \" $1$ \" came from. Furthermore, he says to apply $(a)$ again, but I have no idea what it means to \"apply\" a theorem arbitrarily. He doesn't say what to apply it to, and if he meant to apply it on $n(y - x) > 1$ , then I am even more confused with the following step. He \"applies\" $(a)$ to obtain positive integers $m_1$ and $m_2$ such that $m_1 > nx$ and $m_2 > -nx$ . As far as I understand, the archimedean property says that for $x > 0$ , there is a positive integer $n$ such that $nx > y$ . I don't understand how $m_1 > nx$ and $m_2 > -nx$ follow this property. In $m_1 > nx$ , the equality sign is reversed from the archimedean property definition, and for $m_2 > -nx$ , there is a negative sign. And then the next line, he says \"hence\" there is an integer $m$ (with $-m_2 \\leq m \\leq m_1$ ) such that $m - 1 \\leq nx \\leq m$ . I don't understand how you can deduce from the previous lines ( $m_1 > nx$ and $m_2 > -nx$ ) to arrive at this one. Where are all these $m$ 's coming from? The only connection I see is that number $1$ from $n(y - x) > 1$ from the first step. I have no clue where these $m$ 's appeared out of nowhere.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Your confusion seems to arise because the Archimedes principle is stated in terms of $x,y$ , and you have different $x,y$ in (b). Restate the Archimedean principle as: (a) If $u,v$ are real numbers, with $u>0$ then there is a positive integer $k$ such that: $ku>v$ . (All I've done is change the variables, I hope.) Now, $1$ is a real number, $y-x$ is a real number, and you've proven that $y-x>0$ . So we know from (a) that if $u:=y-x$ and $v:=1$ that there is a positive integer, which we will call $n$ , such that $(y-x)n>1$ . Similarly, since we know that $nx$ is a real number, and we know that $1$ is a real number and $1>0$ , that from (a), setting $u:=1$ and $v:=nx$ , that there is a positive integer we'll call $m_1$ such that $m_1\\cdot 1 > nx$ . Finally, set $u:=1>0$ and $v:=-nx$ to show that there must be an $m_2$ so that $m_2\\cdot 1>-nx$ . The last step is subtler, and doesn't use (a). Since $m_2>-nx$ , $-m_2<nx$ . So we know that $-m_2<m_1$ . Now, you need a property of the integers: If a non-empty set of integers has a lower bound, then it has a least element. Take the set $S=\\{m\\in\\mathbb Z: m> nx\\}$ . We know that $m_1\\in S$ , so $S$ is non-empty, and we know that $-m_2$ is a lower bound for $S$ . So there is a least element $m\\in S$ . Then $m-1\\notin S$ , and therefore $m> nx$ and $m-1\\leq nx$ . So $m-1\\leq nx< m$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's break down the user's question. They're struggling with understanding the proof of Theorem 1.20(b) in Rudin's PMA, specifically how the Archimedean property is applied and the steps involving m1, m2, and m. \n\nFirst, the user is confused about where the \"1\" in n(y - x) > 1 comes from. From Rudin's proof, he uses the Archimedean property on y - x, which is positive because x < y. The Archimedean property states that for any positive real number (here, y - x) and another real number (here, 1), there's an integer n such that n(y - x) > 1. So the \"1\" is just a chosen number to ensure that the interval between nx and ny is more than 1, which helps in finding an integer m in between.\n\nNext, the user is confused about applying the Archimedean property again to get m1 and m2. The Archimedean property says that for any real number, say nx, there's an integer m1 such that m1 > nx. Similarly, since -nx is a real number, there's m2 such that m2 > -nx, which implies -m2 < nx. This gives bounds on nx: -m2 < nx < m1. Then, among all integers between -m2 and m1, there must be an integer m such that m - 1 ≤ nx < m. This m is found by considering the set of integers greater than nx and picking the smallest one, which is the essence of the well-ordering principle.\n\nThe user also questions the reversal of inequalities. The Archimedean property is stated as \"nx > y\", but here it's used as \"m1 > nx\". That's just a matter of variable substitution. If we set y = nx in the property, then there exists an integer m1 such that m1 * 1 > nx. Since 1 is the multiplicative identity, this simplifies to m1 > nx.\n\nFinally, the connection to the integer m comes from the fact that between -m2 and m1, there are integers, and by subtracting 1 from m, we can sandwich nx between m-1 and m. Then, dividing by n gives the rational number p = m/n between x and y.\n\nSo, the key assumptions are the Archimedean property applied to different values, leading to the existence of integers m1, m2, and subsequently m, which allows constructing the desired rational number.",
