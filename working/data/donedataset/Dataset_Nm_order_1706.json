    "Content": "I am trying to prove this binomial identity $\\displaystyle\\sum_{r=0}^n {r {n \\choose r}} = n2^{n-1}$ but am not able to think something except induction,which is of-course not necessary (I think) here, so I am inquisitive to prove this in a more general way. The left side of an identity occurs while solving another problem (concerning binomial theorem) so I am more interested in deriving the right side from the left side, else I have to remember it now onward. EDIT: I am more interested in an algebraic proof rather than combinatorial argument or something involving calculus (however I liked svenkatr and Bill Dubuque solution), hence I am removing the combinatorics tag.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants to prove the binomial identity ∑₀ⁿ r⋅C(n, r) = n⋅2ⁿ⁻¹. They mentioned not wanting induction, combinatorics, or calculus, so they probably want an algebraic proof. Let me recall different methods.\n\nFirst, I remember that binomial coefficients often relate to expansions of (1 + x)ⁿ. Maybe differentiating both sides could help. For example, consider the expansion of (1 + x)ⁿ = ∑ C(n, r)xʳ. If I take the derivative with respect to x, I get n(1 + x)ⁿ⁻¹ = ∑ r⋅C(n, r)xʳ⁻¹. Then multiply both sides by x to get n x (1 + x)ⁿ⁻¹ = ∑ r⋅C(n, r)xʳ. If I set x = 1, the left side becomes n⋅1⋅2ⁿ⁻¹, and the right side is ∑ r⋅C(n, r), which matches the identity. But wait, the user said no calculus. Hmm, so differentiation might be considered calculus. Maybe they need another way.\n\nAlternatively, there's an algebraic identity: r⋅C(n, r) = n⋅C(n−1, r−1). Let's verify that. C(n, r) = n!/(r!(n−r)!), so r⋅C(n, r) = n!/( (r−1)!(n−r)! )) = n⋅(n−1)!/( (r−1)! ( (n−1)−(r−1) )! )) = n⋅C(n−1, r−1). So substituting this into the sum gives ∑₀ⁿ n⋅C(n−1, r−1). The sum over r from 0 to n of C(n−1, r−1) is equivalent to summing from r=1 to n, since C(n−1, -1) is zero. So it's n times the sum from k=0 to n−1 of C(n−1, k), which is n⋅2ⁿ⁻¹. That works algebraically without calculus. \n\nSo the key step is recognizing that r⋅C(n, r) = n⋅C(n−1, r−1), which transforms the sum into something that can use the binomial theorem. Let me check if this approach is valid. Yes, because changing variables (let k = r−1) gives the sum from k=0 to n−1 of C(n−1, k), which is indeed 2ⁿ⁻¹. Multiplying by n gives the right-hand side. This seems to be the algebraic proof the user is looking for. They wanted to derive the RHS from the LHS, so starting with the sum and transforming it using that identity would work. I should present the assumptions and problem accordingly. The problem is straightforward, so the assumption is just that n is a non-negative integer, maybe. Wait, the original problem says r goes from 0 to n, so n must be a non-negative integer. That's the only assumption needed here.",
