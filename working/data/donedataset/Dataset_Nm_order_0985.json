    "Content": "Exercise 11, page 45 from Hungerford's book Algebra . If $H$ is a cyclic subgroup of $G$ and $H$ is normal in $G$, then every\n  subgroup of $H$ is normal in $G$. I am trying to show that $a^{-1}Ka\\subset K$, but I got stuck. What I am supposed to do now? Thanks for your kindly help.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here is a somewhat more general fact which seems useful enough to keep in mind: If $G$ is a group, $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ and $K$ is a characteristic subgroup of $H$, then $K$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. The proof is almost immediate if you know the definitions: for any $x \\in G$, since $H$ is normal in $G$, conjugation by $H$ induces an automorphism $\\varphi_x$ of $H$, but not necessarily an \"inner\" automorphism: i.e., if $x \\notin H$, $\\varphi_x$ need not be conjugation by any element of $H$.  Thus we have assumed that $K$ is just not normal but characteristic as a subgroup of $H$, i.e., stable under all automorphisms of $H$.  Done. For much more detail, see e.g. here . As others have pointed out, we also need to see that any subgroup of a cyclic group $H$ is characteristic.  Well, any subgroup which is the unique subgroup of its order is characteristic -- this takes care of the case in which $H$ is finite.  And any subgroup which is the unique subgroup of its index is characteristic -- this takes care of the case in which $H$ is infinite.  (Alternately, if $H \\cong (\\mathbb{Z},+)$, the only nontrivial automorphism is multiplication by $-1$, which evidently stabilizes all the subgroups $n \\mathbb{Z}$.)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example they provided shows how to extract assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe original problem from Math Stack Exchange is about cyclic normal subgroups. The title says: \"If H is a cyclic subgroup of G and H is normal in G, then every subgroup of H is normal in G.\" The question mentions Exercise 11 from Hungerford's Algebra, and the user is stuck trying to show that a⁻¹Ka is a subset of K.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the problem and list all the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. Let's see:\n\n1. H is a cyclic subgroup of G. So, H is cyclic, and it's a subgroup of G.\n2. H is normal in G. So, H ⊲ G.\n3. Every subgroup of H is to be shown as normal in G. But the problem is to prove this statement, so the assumptions are the first two points.\n\nWait, the problem is to prove that every subgroup of H is normal in G, given that H is cyclic and normal in G. So the assumptions are H being cyclic, H being a subgroup of G, and H being normal in G. But according to the example, each assumption is listed line by line. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem had A(n) defined, and the assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. The problem was to prove divisibility by 91. So the assumptions were split into two: one about n being integer, another about n divisible by 7.\n\nSimilarly, here, the assumptions would be:\n\n- H is a cyclic subgroup of G.\n- H is normal in G.\n\nEach of these is a separate condition. The problem then is to show every subgroup of H is normal in G.\n\nWait, but does H being cyclic and normal in G imply all its subgroups are normal? Let me think. Since H is cyclic, all its subgroups are cyclic, and in a cyclic group, every subgroup is characteristic if the group is cyclic of order 2, but wait, maybe not. Wait, in cyclic groups, all subgroups are characteristic if the cyclic group is finite? No, not necessarily. Wait, but if H is cyclic and normal in G, then any automorphism of G would map H to itself, but does that make the subgroups of H invariant under conjugation?\n\nAlternatively, since H is cyclic, every subgroup of H is generated by some element, say, a^k where a generates H. Since H is normal in G, for any g in G, gag⁻¹ is in H. Then, since H is cyclic, gag⁻¹ = a^m for some m. Then, conjugating the subgroup generated by a^k would result in the subgroup generated by a^{mk}, which is still a subgroup of H, hence the same subgroup if the order is preserved. Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nBut the user's task is just to structure the problem, not solve it. So the key here is to extract the assumptions correctly. The problem states: If H is a cyclic subgroup of G and H is normal in G, then every subgroup of H is normal in G. So the assumptions are:\n\n1. H is a cyclic subgroup of G.\n2. H is normal in G.\n\nThen the problem is to prove every subgroup of H is normal in G.\n\nSo the formatted problem should list these two assumptions and state the problem accordingly.\n\nWait, the example given by the user had the problem's assumption split into two lines, each being one property. So here, each assumption would be a separate line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nH is a cyclic subgroup of G,\nH is normal in G.\n\nProblem:\nProve that every subgroup of H is normal in G.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Let me check again. The original problem states H is cyclic and normal, so those are two separate assumptions. The problem is to show all subgroups of H are normal in G. Therefore, the formatted version should have those two assumptions and the problem as stated.\n\nThe user also mentioned that in their example, they included the divisibility by 7 as an assumption even though the original problem didn't state it. Wait, no, in their example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem had assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, the original problem in the example was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" So why does the formatted problem have \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption? That seems like a mistake. Unless maybe the original problem had a typo or the user made a mistake. Wait, perhaps in the original problem, maybe the user intended n to be divisible by 7, but the example's original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems conflicting. Maybe that was a mistake in the example. But regardless, the user provided that example as a reference.\n\nBut in the current problem, the original question is correct: H is cyclic and normal, then every subgroup of H is normal. So the two assumptions are H cyclic and H normal, and the problem is to prove the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nH is a cyclic subgroup of G,\nH is normal in G.\nProblem:\nProve that every subgroup of H is normal in G.\n###",
