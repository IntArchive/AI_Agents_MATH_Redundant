    "AcceptedAnswer": "Somewhat more generally, let \n$$ F(s) = \\int_0^\\infty \\dfrac{x^2+a x+ b}{(x+1)^3} e^{-sx}\\; dx$$\nwhich converges for $\\text{Re}(s) > 0$.  It is the Laplace transform of\n$$ f(x) = \\dfrac{x^2 + a x + b}{(x+1)^3}$$\nThe general solution is\n$$ F(s) = \\dfrac{e^s}{2} \\left((b-a+1) s^2 + (4-2a) s +2\\right) Ei(1,s) + \n\\left(a-1-b\\right) \\dfrac{s}{2}+\\dfrac{a+b-3}{2} $$\nwhere $$Ei(1,s) = \\int_1^\\infty \\dfrac{e^{-st}}{t}\\; dt$$ is the exponential integral function.\nFor an elementary solution, what you need is $(b-a+1) s^2 + (4 - 2 a) s + 2 = 0$\nwhich is what you have in the case at hand with $a=b=3$, $s = 1 \\pm i$. EDIT: \nThat \"general solution\" comes about this way.  First make the change of variables $x+1=t$, and expand $f(x)$ in powers of $t$.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to format this problem correctly. The user provided an example where they listed assumptions and then the problem. For the given Math Stack Exchange question, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nFirst, the original problem is an integral: ∫₀^∞ (x² + 3x + 3)/(x + 1)³ e^{-x} sin x dx = 1/2. The user wants to structure this into assumptions and the problem.\n\nLooking at the example, assumptions are specific conditions. In this integral problem, the assumptions might be about the limits of integration (from 0 to infinity), the integrand's structure, and perhaps the functions involved. However, the example given for the divisibility problem had an assumption about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the integral's assumptions might be the domain of integration, the integrand's form, and maybe the convergence of the integral. But since the problem is to compute the integral and show it equals 1/2, the key assumptions are the integral's limits and the integrand's components. The original question doesn't mention any parameters or conditions, so maybe the assumptions are just the integral setup. Wait, the example's assumptions included the variables and their properties. Here, the variable is x, integrated over [0, ∞). The integrand is a specific function. But in the example, the assumptions were about the variable n. So here, perhaps the assumption is that x is a real variable, the integral is from 0 to infinity, and the integrand is as given. But the example didn't state the variable type unless it was necessary. Wait, in the example, the user wrote \"$n$ is an integer\", so for the integral problem, maybe we need to note that x is a real variable, but since the problem is about evaluating the integral, maybe the main assumption is the integral from 0 to infinity. But perhaps the problem doesn't have additional assumptions beyond the integral's definition. The user's example included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, it was split into \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\" which was incorrect. Wait, actually the original example's problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Wait, no. Wait, in the example, the user wrote:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that seems conflicting. The original says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like an error. So maybe the user made a mistake in the example. But perhaps the actual problem had a hidden condition. Wait, maybe the user's example was a mistake. Hmm, but regardless, the task is to structure the given integral problem into assumptions and problem.\n\nFor the integral problem, the question is to prove that the integral equals 1/2. The integral is from 0 to infinity, and the integrand is (x² + 3x + 3)/(x + 1)^3 * e^{-x} * sin x. So the assumptions here would be:\n\n1. The integral is taken over the interval [0, ∞).\n2. The integrand is (x² + 3x + 3)/(x + 1)^3 multiplied by e^{-x} and sin x.\n3. The problem involves real analysis.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe variable x is a real number,\nThe integral is computed from 0 to infinity,\nThe integrand is the function (x² + 3x + 3)/(x + 1)^3 * e^{-x} * sin x.\n\nBut maybe even more precise. The example's first assumption was \"$n$ is an integer\". So here, the variable x is integrated over [0, ∞), which is part of the problem statement. So perhaps:\n\nAssumptions:\nx is a real variable,\nThe lower limit of integration is 0,\nThe upper limit of integration is infinity,\nThe integrand is (x² + 3x + 3)/(x + 1)^3 * e^{-x} * sin x.\n\nBut maybe that's too granular. Alternatively, the integral is defined as ∫₀^∞ [ (x² +3x +3)/(x+1)^3 e^{-x} sin x ] dx. So the main assumptions are the integral setup. However, since the problem is to evaluate this specific integral, perhaps the assumptions are just the integral's components. But in the example, the user split \"for every integer n\" into an assumption that n is an integer. Similarly, here, the integral is from 0 to infinity, so maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is taken over the interval [0, ∞),\nThe integrand is (x² + 3x + 3)/(x + 1)^3 e^{-x} sin x.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that this integral equals 1/2.\n\nSo putting that together:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is taken over the interval [0, ∞),\nThe integrand is \\(\\frac{x^2 + 3x + 3}{(x + 1)^3} e^{-x} \\sin x\\).\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\int_0^{\\infty}\\frac{x^2+3x+3}{(x+1)^3} e^{-x}\\sin x\\, dx = \\frac{1}{2}.$$\n\nBut in the example, they listed each assumption line by line, so maybe each part is separate. The original example had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. But in reality, the original problem was for every integer n, so the assumption should just be n is an integer. The example's formatted problem incorrectly added n divisible by 7, but perhaps the user made a typo. Anyway, following the user's example, even if it's incorrect, we need to split the problem into assumptions. For the integral problem, the integral is from 0 to infinity, so that's one assumption. The integrand is a specific function, which is another. But maybe each mathematical object's conditions. For example:\n\nAssumption:\nThe lower limit of integration is 0,\nThe upper limit of integration is infinity,\nThe integrand is \\(\\frac{x^2 + 3x + 3}{(x + 1)^3} e^{-x} \\sin x\\).\n\nBut perhaps \"integral is taken over [0, ∞)\" as one assumption. Then the integrand is another. Alternatively, the integral's limits are part of the problem statement. The problem says \"Prove that [integral] equals 1/2\". So the assumptions are the components of the integral: domain and integrand. Therefore, two assumptions: integral from 0 to infinity, and integrand is that function. Alternatively, since the integrand has multiple parts, maybe split them? But according to the user's instruction, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integration variable is x,\nThe lower limit of integration is 0,\nThe upper limit of integration is infinity,\nThe numerator of the rational function is \\(x^2 + 3x + 3\\),\nThe denominator of the rational function is \\((x + 1)^3\\),\nThe exponential factor is \\(e^{-x}\\),\nThe trigonometric factor is \\(\\sin x\\).\n\nBut this seems too granular. The user's example didn't break down the expression into parts. In their example, the assumption was \"$n$ is an integer\", which is a condition on n. The problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, with A(n) defined as an expression. So for the integral problem, the main assumptions would be the integral's limits and the integrand's expression. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is computed from 0 to ∞,\nThe integrand is \\(\\frac{x^2 + 3x + 3}{(x + 1)^3} e^{-x} \\sin x\\).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the integral equals 1/2.\n\nThat seems reasonable. Each assumption is one line, addressing one property. So the answer should be structured that way.",
