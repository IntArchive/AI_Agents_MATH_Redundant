We have \n$$\\theta x_k + (1-\\theta)y_k \\leq \\theta \\max_i x_i + (1-\\theta)\\max_i y_i$$\nbecause $x_k \\leq \\max_i x_i$, $y_k \\leq \\max_i y_i$, $\\theta \\geq 0$ and $1-\\theta \\geq 0$.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to break down the problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement as per the example provided.\n\nThe original question is about showing that the max function on R^n is convex. The function is defined as f(x) = max(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n). The book's proof uses the inequality max_i (θx_i + (1-θ)y_i) ≤ θ max_i x_i + (1-θ)max_i y_i for 0 ≤ θ ≤ 1. The user is confused about why this inequality holds.\n\nLooking at the example, the assumptions were about the properties of the variables involved. Here, the key assumptions would relate to the properties of the max function, the domain of the variables, and the parameters used in the convexity definition.\n\nFirst, the function f is defined on R^n, so each x and y are vectors in R^n. Then, θ is between 0 and 1, which is part of the definition of convexity. Also, the max function is applied component-wise. Each x_i and y_i are real numbers. The convex combination θx + (1-θ)y is taken for each component.\n\nSo the assumptions should list each of these conditions separately. Each assumption should mention a single property applied to one object. For example, θ is in the interval [0,1], x and y are vectors in R^n, each x_i and y_i is a real number, etc.\n\nThe problem statement would then be asking to show that the max function is convex, which translates to proving that inequality provided in the book's proof.\n\nI need to make sure I don't include unnecessary information. The original question mentions the user's confusion about the inequality, but the formatted problem should just present the problem to be solved, which is showing the convexity of the max function, with the given assumptions.\n\nChecking the example again: the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, with assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Similarly, here, the problem is to show the max function is convex, with assumptions on θ, x, y, etc.\n\nSo, structuring this:\n\nAssumptions:\n- x is a vector in ℝ^n\n- y is a vector in ℝ^n\n- θ is a real number such that 0 ≤ θ ≤ 1\n- For each i, x_i is a real number\n- For each i, y_i is a real number\n- The function f is defined as f(z) = max(z_1, z_2, ..., z_n) for any vector z in ℝ^n\n\nProblem: Show that f(θx + (1-θ)y) ≤ θf(x) + (1-θ)f(y)\n\nWait, but the original problem statement is \"Show that max function on ℝ^n is convex\". The proof in the book uses that inequality. So the formatted problem should be to prove that the max function is convex, which by definition requires showing f(θx + (1-θ)y) ≤ θf(x) + (1-θ)f(y) for all x,y in ℝ^n and θ in [0,1]. Therefore, the problem is \"Prove that the function f(x) = max(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) is convex.\"\n\nBut according to the example, the problem line was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" So here, the problem line should be \"Prove that the function f is convex.\" Or more precisely, \"Show that the function f defined by f(x) = max(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) is convex.\"\n\nBut the user's example included the specific expression, so maybe in this case, since the problem is about the max function, the problem line would be: \"Prove that the function $$f(x) = \\max(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n)$$ is convex.\"\n\nThen the assumptions are all the underlying conditions needed. Let me check each assumption:\n\n- x and y are vectors in ℝ^n (each is a vector, so separate assumptions for x and y? Or combined? The example had separate lines for each assumption. For instance, \"$n$ is an integer\", \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". So here, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- x is a vector in ℝ^n,\n- y is a vector in ℝ^n,\n- θ is a real number between 0 and 1 (inclusive),\n- For each i, x_i is a real number,\n- For each i, y_i is a real number,\n- The function f is defined as f(z) = max(z_1, z_2, ..., z_n).\n\nBut wait, the first two assumptions (x and y being vectors in R^n) already imply that their components are real numbers. So maybe redundant to list \"For each i, x_i is a real number\". But perhaps to be thorough, as per the example where both \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are separate, even though the first is a general condition and the second a specific one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the components being real is inherent in the vectors being in R^n. But perhaps the user's example lists all necessary assumptions, even if some are implied. The example included \"n is an integer\" even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n\". So in this case, since x and y are vectors in R^n, their components are real numbers by definition. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- x and y are vectors in ℝ^n,\n- θ is a real number such that 0 ≤ θ ≤ 1,\n- The function f is defined as f(z) = max{z_1, z_2, ..., z_n} for any z ∈ ℝ^n.\n\nBut the example had separate lines for each assumption, even if they are related. So if we list \"x is a vector in ℝ^n\" and \"y is a vector in ℝ^n\" as separate lines. Also, the function definition is an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is structured as:\n\nAssumption:\n- x and y are vectors in ℝ^n,\n- θ is a real number such that 0 ≤ θ ≤ 1,\n- The function f: ℝ^n → ℝ is defined by f(z) = max(z_1, z_2, ..., z_n).\n\nBut the example had each assumption on separate lines. For instance, in the example, two separate lines: \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". So here, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- x is a vector in ℝ^n,\n- y is a vector in ℝ^n,\n- θ is a real number,\n- 0 ≤ θ ≤ 1,\n- For each index i, z_i is the i-th component of vector z ∈ ℝ^n,\n- The function f is defined as f(z) = max(z_1, z_2, ..., z_n).\n\nBut some of these might be redundant. The key points are that x and y are in R^n, theta is between 0 and 1, and the function f is defined as the max of the components. The components being real is implied by the vectors being in R^n. So maybe the necessary assumptions are:\n\n- x is a vector in ℝ^n,\n- y is a vector in ℝ^n,\n- θ is a real number such that 0 ≤ θ ≤ 1,\n- The function f: ℝ^n → ℝ is defined by f(z) = max(z_1, z_2, ..., z_n).\n\nBut the problem is to show convexity, which by definition requires the inequality. So these assumptions set up the problem. The user's example didn't include all possible implicit assumptions but focused on the explicit ones given in the problem. For instance, in the original example, the problem stated \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted assumptions, they listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, actually, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem's assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but 91 is 7*13, so perhaps the problem in the example was misformatted? Wait, in the example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91\". The formatted problem's assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems conflicting. Because if n is any integer, why is the assumption that n is divisible by 7? Unless perhaps the user made a mistake in the example? Hmm, perhaps the original problem actually had a condition that n is divisible by 7, but the example might be incorrect. Or maybe the user intended to show divisibility by 91 under the assumption that n is divisible by 7? That might be a mistake. But in any case, the example shows that each assumption is listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo applying that here, the assumptions would be:\n\n- x is a vector in ℝ^n,\n- y is a vector in ℝ^n,\n- θ is a real number,\n- 0 ≤ θ ≤ 1,\n- The function f is defined as f(z) = max(z_1, z_2, ..., z_n).\n\nBut each of these should be separate lines. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- x is a vector in ℝ^n,\n- y is a vector in ℝ^n,\n- θ is a real number,\n- θ satisfies 0 ≤ θ ≤ 1,\n- The function f assigns to each vector z ∈ ℝ^n the value max(z_1, z_2, ..., z_n).\n\nBut maybe even splitting θ's conditions:\n\n- θ is a real number between 0 and 1 (inclusive).\n\nBut the example had separate lines for each property, even if they apply to the same object. For instance, \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\" are two separate lines for the same object. So here, for θ, maybe:\n\n- θ is a real number,\n- 0 ≤ θ ≤ 1.\n\nSimilarly, x and y are separate vectors. So each gets their own line.\n\nSo compiling all together:\n\nAssumption:\n- x is a vector in ℝ^n,\n- y is a vector in ℝ^n,\n- θ is a real number,\n- 0 ≤ θ ≤ 1,\n- For each vector z in ℝ^n, f(z) is defined as the maximum of its components.\n\nProblem: Prove that the function f is convex, i.e., show that $$f(\\theta x + (1 - \\theta)y) \\leq \\theta f(x) + (1 - \\theta)f(y).$$\n\nBut in the original question, the problem is to show the max function is convex, which is exactly the inequality in the problem line. So the problem line would be \"Prove that the function f is convex,\" which entails the inequality. Alternatively, to directly state the inequality as the problem, as in the example where the problem was to prove the expression is divisible by 91. Here, the problem is to prove the inequality, which is the definition of convexity.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n- x is a vector in $\\mathbb R^n$,\n- y is a vector in $\\mathbb R^n$,\n- $\\theta$ is a real number,\n- $0 \\leq \\theta \\leq 1$,\n- The function $f$ is defined as $f(z) = \\max(z_1, z_2, \\dots, z_n)$ for any $z \\in \\mathbb R^n$.\nProblem: \nProve that $$f(\\theta x + (1 - \\theta)y) \\leq \\theta f(x) + (1 - \\theta)f(y).$$\n###",
