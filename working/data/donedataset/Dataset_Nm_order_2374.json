    "Content": "I have been trying to prove that $x^2 + 1 $ is not a perfect square (other than $0^2 +1^2=1^2$). I'm stuck and can't move forward. The thing I have tried so is to relate the problem to a hyperbola and find an integer solution for both $x$ and $y$ when $a=b=1$. The pell's equation came up in my search, but I don't understand it fully. Note: I was in a confused state and @CoolHandLouis' visual answer cleared my muddled mind, so I selected that answer. In that way, his answer was very helpful to me.  @Alessandro's proof is clear to me now and if I could accept two answers, I would accepted that one too.  Thanks to everyone for helping!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "We want to prove $x^2 + 1$ can never be a perfect square. Let $f(x) = x^2$ Then, $f(x)$     $<$       $f(x) + 1$      $<$      $f(x+1)$ $x^2$           $<$        $x^2 + 1$     $<$      $x^2 + 2x + 1$        (for all $x > 0$). Therefore, $x^2 + 1$ cannot be a perfect square (except $x = 0$) because it will always be greater than the prior perfect square and less than the next perfect square. The following table illustrates this.  Note that $f(x)$ is the set of all perfect squares: x    f(x)=x^2       x^2+1       f(x+1)    \n0        0            1            1     \n1        1            2            4        \n2        4            5            9        \n3        9           10           16        \n4       16           17           25",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is whether a number of the form x² + 1 can be a square number, except for the case 0² +1² =1². \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem states that x is an integer because we're talking about square numbers in the context of integers. The equation in question is x² + 1 = y², where y should also be an integer. The only known solution mentioned is when x=0 and y=1, so we need to exclude that case. Therefore, the assumptions should capture that x and y are integers, the equation x² +1 = y² holds, and x is not zero.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"other than 0² +1²=1²\", so maybe x can be zero, but the problem wants to exclude that solution. Hmm. The problem is to show that there are no other solutions besides x=0. So the assumptions should include that x and y are integers, and that x² +1 equals y², but x is not zero. Alternatively, maybe the assumption is that x is a non-zero integer. Let me check the example given. In the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Each assumption is a single property applied to one object.\n\nSo here, the objects are x and y. The problem is to show that x² +1 cannot be a perfect square unless x=0. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- x is an integer.\n- y is an integer.\n- The equation x² +1 = y² holds.\n- x is not equal to 0.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"other than 0² +1²=1²\", so maybe the user wants to show that x² +1 is not a perfect square except for x=0. Therefore, the problem is to prove that if x is an integer and x ≠ 0, then x² +1 is not a perfect square. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- x is an integer.\n- x ≠ 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that x² +1 is not a perfect square.\n\nBut wait, the original question is more general. The user is trying to show that x² +1 cannot be a square number except for the case when x=0. So the problem is to prove that the equation x² +1 = y² has no integer solutions where x ≠ 0.\n\nAlternatively, in the example, the assumption included specific conditions on the variables. So maybe here, the assumptions would be:\n\n- x is an integer.\n- y is an integer.\n- x² +1 = y².\n- x ≠ 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that there are no solutions.\n\nBut the original problem's problem statement is \"Prove that x² +1 is not a perfect square (other than 0² +1²=1²).\" So maybe the problem is to show that for any integer x ≠0, x² +1 is not a perfect square. Therefore, the assumptions are x is an integer, x ≠0, and the problem is to prove that x² +1 is not a perfect square. However, in the example, they included the divisibility condition as a separate assumption. Here, perhaps the key is that x is an integer not equal to zero, and the problem is to show x² +1 is not a square. Let me check the example again. In the example, they listed n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7 as two separate assumptions, each addressing one property. So here, x is an integer, x ≠0. Then the problem is to prove x² +1 is not a perfect square. Alternatively, the equation x² +1 = y² is part of the problem statement. Wait, in the example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. So perhaps the problem here is to prove that x² +1 = y² has no integer solutions with x ≠0. So the assumptions would be x and y are integers, and the problem is to show that x² +1 = y² implies x=0. But the user is trying to prove that x² +1 is not a perfect square except when x=0. So maybe the correct structure is:\n\nAssumption:\n- x is an integer,\n- y is an integer,\n- x ≠ 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that x² +1 cannot equal y².\n\nAlternatively, maybe the equation is part of the problem statement. Let me see. The example had the problem as \"Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" So perhaps here, the problem is \"Prove that x² +1 is not a perfect square when x ≠0.\" Therefore, the assumptions would be x is an integer, x ≠0, and the problem is to prove x² +1 is not a perfect square. Alternatively, the problem could be phrased as \"Prove that there are no integers x, y with x ≠0 such that x² +1 = y².\" So the assumptions would include x and y being integers and x ≠0, and the problem is to show that x² +1 ≠ y². But in the example, the problem was stated as the equation and the divisibility. So perhaps here, the problem is \"Prove that x² +1 cannot be a perfect square,\" with the assumptions being x is an integer and x ≠0. Wait, but the original question says \"can a number of the form x² +1 be a square number?\" So the problem is to determine whether x² +1 is a square number. The answer is no, except when x=0. So the problem is to prove that if x is an integer, then x² +1 is a square number only if x=0. Therefore, the assumptions would be x is an integer, y is an integer, and the problem is to prove that if x² +1 = y², then x=0. Alternatively, the problem is to prove that x² +1 is not a perfect square unless x=0. So perhaps:\n\nAssumptions:\n- x is an integer,\n- y is an integer,\n- x² +1 = y².\n\nProblem: Prove that x must be 0.\n\nBut the example had the problem statement as the equation and the divisibility. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem listed the assumptions as n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, then the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. Wait, but in the original problem, the user had to structure the problem with assumptions and problem. So here, the problem is \"Prove that x² +1 is not a perfect square (other than 0² +1²=1²)\". So the assumptions would be x is an integer, x ≠0, and the problem is to prove that x² +1 is not a perfect square. Alternatively, if we include the equation in the problem, maybe:\n\nAssumptions:\n- x is an integer,\n- y is an integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that the equation x² +1 = y² has no solutions except x=0, y=±1.\n\nBut how does this fit into the example's format? The example had the problem as the equation and the divisibility. Let me see. The example's problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91, with assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So perhaps in this case, the problem is to prove that x² +1 is not a perfect square, given that x is an integer not equal to 0. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- x is an integer,\n- x ≠ 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that x² +1 is not a perfect square.\n\nBut the problem could also involve y, but maybe the problem statement should include the equation. Alternatively, the problem is to show that there are no integers x, y with x ≠0 such that x² +1 = y². So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n- x is an integer,\n- y is an integer,\n- x ≠ 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that x² +1 ≠ y².\n\nAlternatively, since the original question is \"can a number of the form x² +1 be a square number?\" the answer is no, except when x=0. So the problem is to prove that there are no integer solutions to x² +1 = y² with x ≠0. So the assumptions would be x and y are integers, x ≠0, and the problem is to show that x² +1 ≠ y². However, in the example, the problem was stated as the expression being divisible by 91, with the assumptions on n. So here, perhaps the problem is to prove that x² +1 is not a perfect square, with assumptions that x is an integer and x ≠0. So I think the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- x is an integer,\n- x ≠ 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that x² +1 is not a perfect square.\n\nBut the original problem mentions that the user tried to relate it to a hyperbola and Pell's equation. Pell's equation is y² - x² =1, which factors as (y - x)(y + x)=1. In integers, the solutions would be y - x =1 and y + x=1, leading to y=1, x=0. So that's the only solution. Therefore, the problem is to show that x² +1 = y² has no integer solutions except x=0. So the problem can be phrased as proving that the only integer solutions to x² +1 = y² are x=0, y=±1. Therefore, the assumptions would be x and y are integers, and the problem is to prove that x² +1 = y² implies x=0. But the example's structure had assumptions on the variables (n is integer, n divisible by 7), then the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. So in this case, the problem is to prove that x² +1 = y² has no solutions except x=0, given that x is an integer. So perhaps the assumptions are x is an integer, y is an integer, and the problem is to prove that x² +1 = y² implies x=0. Alternatively, the problem could be structured as:\n\nAssumption:\n- x and y are integers,\n- x² +1 = y².\n\nProblem: Prove that x = 0.\n\nBut the example had each assumption line addressing one object. So x is an integer, y is an integer, x² +1 = y², and then the problem is to prove x=0. But the example's assumptions were two lines: n is an integer, n divisible by 7. Here, maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n- x is an integer,\n- y is an integer,\n- x² +1 = y².\n\nProblem: Prove that x = 0.\n\nBut the user's original problem says \"Prove that x² +1 is not a perfect square (other than 0² +1²=1²)\". So maybe the problem is to prove that x² +1 is not a perfect square when x ≠0. Therefore, the assumptions would be x is an integer, x ≠0, and the problem is to prove that x² +1 is not a perfect square. However, the problem could be phrased as an equation. Alternatively, considering the example, the problem statement included the expression to prove. So in this case, the problem is \"Prove that x² +1 is not a perfect square,\" with the assumption that x is an integer and x ≠0. That seems to align with the example's structure. The example had \"Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91\" with assumptions on n. So here:\n\nAssumption:\n- x is an integer,\n- x ≠ 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that x² +1 is not a perfect square.\n\nYes, that seems to fit. Because the user wants to show that for any integer x not zero, x² +1 isn't a square. So the assumptions are x is integer and x ≠0, problem is to prove x² +1 is not a perfect square. Alternatively, if y is part of the problem, but in the example, the problem included the expression A(n) with the variables. Here, the problem is to show that the number x² +1 isn't a square, so the problem statement is as given. Therefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n- x is an integer,\n- x ≠ 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that x² +1 is not a perfect square.\n\nI think that's the correct structure based on the example provided.",
