    "Content": "There is a proposition in Beachy and Blair's Abstract Algebra that I don't entirely follow. The proposition is the following: Let $G$ be a group of order $pq$, where $p > q$ are primes. a) If $q$ is not a divisor of $p-1$, the $G$ is cyclic. b) If $q$ is a divisor of $p-1$, then either $G$ is cyclic or else $G$ is generated by two elements $a$ and $b$ satisfying the following equations: $$a^p = e, \\\\ b^q = e,\\\\ ba = a^nb $$ where $n \\not \\equiv 1  \\ (mod \\ p)$ but $n^q \\equiv 1 \\ (mod \\ p)$. Can one of you prove how this is true? I understand a similar proof for when $q=2$, but this one is more complicated.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$ with order $p$ and $K$ be a subgroup of order $q$, It is easy to see that $H$ must be normal in $G(*)$ Then $K$ act on $H$ by conjugation so we have $\\phi:K\\to Aut(H)\\cong \\mathbb Z_{p-1}$. a) If $q\\nmid p-1$ then $\\phi$ is trivial homomorphism which implies $G=HK\\cong H\\times K$ which conclude that $G$ is cylic. b) if $q\\mid p-1$ then $G$ need not to be cyclic but clearly $G=\\left<a,b\\right>$ where $H=\\left<a\\right>$ and\n$K=\\left<b\\right>$ as $G=HK$. And $bab^{-1}\\in H$ since $H$ is normal and since it is cyclic then $bab^{-1}=a^k$ for some $k$. I think you can get from this point.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The user provided an example where they listed assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object. Then they presented the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the original question from Math Stack Exchange:\n\nThe title is \"Structure of a group, G, of order pq where p, q are prime.\" The question then discusses a proposition from Beachy and Blair's Abstract Algebra. The proposition has two parts, (a) and (b). The user is asking for a proof of this proposition, specifically part (b), since they mention understanding the case when q=2 but find this more complicated.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The group G has order pq where p and q are primes, and p > q. For part (a), the condition is that q does not divide p-1. For part (b), q does divide p-1. Then, in part (b), either G is cyclic or it's generated by elements a and b with certain relations: a^p = e, b^q = e, and ba = a^n b where n is not congruent to 1 mod p but n^q ≡ 1 mod p.\n\nBut the problem here is to prove the proposition as stated. The user wants a proof of both parts (a) and (b). However, the example given by the user in the format only includes specific assumptions and a problem statement. The example extracted assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7, then stated the problem to prove divisibility by 91.\n\nSo, applying that here: The assumptions would be the conditions given in the proposition. For part (a), the key assumptions are that |G|=pq, p and q are primes with p > q, and q does not divide p-1. For part (b), the assumption is that q divides p-1. Then the problem is to prove that in case (a) G is cyclic, and in case (b) either G is cyclic or it's generated by a and b with those relations.\n\nBut the user's original question includes both parts (a) and (b). However, when structuring, perhaps each part should be considered separately. Wait, the example had only one problem, but here the proposition has two parts. But the user is asking for proof of the entire proposition. However, the format requires the problem to be stated, so perhaps we need to split the assumptions for each part or combine them.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, but the user's formatted problem included an assumption that n is divisible by 7. However, in the original problem statement, the proposition was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1 ) -6^n (3^n +2^n ) is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. But that contradicts the original problem. Wait, maybe the example was a mistake? Hmm, but perhaps the user made a mistake in their example. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, they listed assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that's incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should not restrict n to being divisible by 7. Therefore, perhaps the example is wrong, but the user provided it as their own example. So maybe the user intended that the formatted problem should list the assumptions given in the problem, even if they are part of the problem's original statement. Wait, but in the example, the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7, but the formatted problem added that assumption. That seems incorrect, but perhaps the user made a mistake there. However, we need to follow their format regardless.\n\nBack to the current problem. The proposition in question is about groups of order pq (p > q primes). The problem has two parts. Part (a) assumes q does not divide p-1 and concludes G is cyclic. Part (b) assumes q divides p-1 and concludes G is either cyclic or generated by a and b with those relations.\n\nSo to structure this as per the format:\n\nAssumptions should list the conditions given in the problem. For part (a):\n\n- G is a group of order pq, where p and q are primes.\n\n- p > q.\n\n- q is not a divisor of p - 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that G is cyclic.\n\nFor part (b):\n\n- G is a group of order pq, where p and q are primes.\n\n- p > q.\n\n- q is a divisor of p - 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that either G is cyclic or G is generated by elements a and b satisfying the equations: a^p = e, b^q = e, ba = a^n b where n ≢ 1 mod p and n^q ≡ 1 mod p.\n\nBut since the original problem combines both parts (a) and (b) in the proposition, perhaps we need to present them as two separate problems. However, the user's example only had one problem statement. Given that the user's example combined an assumption that n is an integer (which is given in the original problem) and another assumption that n is divisible by 7 (which wasn't in the original problem), perhaps the example is flawed, but we need to follow the user's instructions regardless.\n\nWait, the original problem in the example states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. Then adds another assumption \"n is divisible by 7\". So the user in the example added an assumption that wasn't present in the original problem, but perhaps they intended to restructure the problem with some conditions. Maybe the original problem in the example had a typo or the user rephrased it. But perhaps the key is that the formatted problem should list all assumptions explicitly, even if they are part of the problem statement.\n\nSo applying that to the current problem: The original problem is about a group G of order pq (p > q primes). The proposition has two cases: when q doesn't divide p-1 (part a) and when it does (part b). The user is asking to prove the entire proposition. However, in the example, the formatted problem included an assumption not in the original problem. But here, the original problem's proposition includes all the conditions. So to structure it as per the example's format:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- G is a group of order pq, where p and q are primes.\n\n- p > q.\n\n- For part (a): q is not a divisor of p - 1.\n\n- For part (b): q is a divisor of p - 1.\n\nBut the example's format lists each assumption line by line. However, the problem statement in the example mentions both parts (a) and (b). Wait, the original problem in the example was a single problem, but the formatted one had assumptions leading to that problem. Here, the proposition has two parts. But the user's example didn't split into parts. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to structure each part separately.\n\nAlternatively, since the proposition is a single proposition with two parts, perhaps list all assumptions and present both parts as the problem. However, the example had only one problem statement. To adhere to the format, perhaps we need to create two separate entries for parts (a) and (b). But the user hasn't specified. Given that the user's example didn't split the problem into parts, but included all assumptions, perhaps we need to present the entire proposition as one problem with assumptions split into general and specific.\n\nWait, the original problem is structured as:\n\nProposition:\n\nLet G be a group of order pq, p > q primes.\n\na) If q does not divide p-1, then G is cyclic.\n\nb) If q divides p-1, then G is either cyclic or generated by a and b with relations...\n\nSo, to format this, perhaps list the assumptions common to both parts first, then the specific assumptions for each part, but since the user's format requires one problem per entry, maybe split into two problems.\n\nBut the user's example didn't split into parts. However, in the current case, the user's question is about the entire proposition. The user wants a proof of the entire proposition, both parts. So perhaps we need to combine both parts into one problem, listing the assumptions accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, considering the user's example, which took a problem that was stated for all integers n but added an assumption about divisibility by 7, perhaps the user wants to extract the specific conditions given in the problem and list them as assumptions. In this case:\n\nFor part (a):\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- G is a group of order pq, where p and q are primes.\n\n- p > q.\n\n- q is not a divisor of p - 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that G is cyclic.\n\nFor part (b):\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- G is a group of order pq, where p and q are primes.\n\n- p > q.\n\n- q is a divisor of p - 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that either G is cyclic or G is generated by elements a and b satisfying a^p = e, b^q = e, and ba = a^n b where n ≢ 1 mod p and n^q ≡ 1 mod p.\n\nBut the user's question mentions both parts (a) and (b) and wants a proof of the proposition. The original problem statement on Math Stack Exchange includes both parts. Therefore, perhaps the formatted problem should include both parts under one problem statement, with the assumptions split accordingly. However, the user's example only had one problem, so perhaps the answer should format each part as a separate problem. But the user's instructions say \"structure that problem as the following format\", implying each original question is one entry. Since the original question is about a proposition with two parts, perhaps we need to structure it as two separate formatted problems. But the user's example didn't do that. Alternatively, present both parts under one problem statement, listing the assumptions for each part.\n\nBut given the example, where the original problem had a universal quantifier (\"for every integer n\") but the formatted problem added an assumption (n divisible by 7), which was not present in the original, it's possible that the user made a mistake in their example, but we need to follow their format.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's example was to show how to extract assumptions from the problem, even if they are part of the problem's original statement. In that case, for the current problem:\n\nThe proposition's assumptions are:\n\n- G is a group of order pq.\n\n- p and q are primes.\n\n- p > q.\n\nThen, for part (a), the additional assumption is that q does not divide p -1.\n\nFor part (b), the additional assumption is that q divides p -1.\n\nSo, to structure the entire proposition as per the example's format:\n\nAssumption:\n\nG is a group of order pq,\n\np and q are primes,\n\np > q,\n\nFor part (a): q is not a divisor of p - 1,\n\nFor part (b): q is a divisor of p - 1.\n\nBut the example listed each assumption line by line. However, the example included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (n divisible by 7), which suggests that maybe the user wants to list all conditions as assumptions, including those that are part of the problem's hypotheses.\n\nBut the original problem here is to prove the proposition, which includes both parts (a) and (b). So perhaps the formatted problem should include the common assumptions and then the problem statement as given.\n\nBut the user's example separated the assumptions, including those that were part of the problem's conditions. For instance, in the example, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So following that pattern:\n\nAssumptions for the current problem:\n\n- G is a group.\n\n- The order of G is pq, where p and q are primes.\n\n- p > q.\n\n- For part (a): q does not divide p - 1.\n\n- For part (b): q divides p - 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that\n\na) If q is not a divisor of p - 1, then G is cyclic.\n\nb) If q is a divisor of p - 1, then either G is cyclic or G is generated by elements a and b satisfying a^p = e, b^q = e, and ba = a^n b where n ≢ 1 mod p and n^q ≡ 1 mod p.\n\nBut the example had a problem statement without parts, but here the problem has parts. However, the user's instructions say to structure the problem as per the format. The example didn't include parts, but the user's own example might have been simplified. Perhaps the answer should follow:\n\nAssumption:\n\nG is a group of order pq,\n\np and q are primes,\n\np > q,\n\nq is not a divisor of p - 1.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that G is cyclic.\n\nThen for part (b):\n\nAssumption:\n\nG is a group of order pq,\n\np and q are primes,\n\np > q,\n\nq is a divisor of p - 1.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that either G is cyclic or G is generated by elements a and b satisfying a^p = e, b^q = e, and ba = a^n b where n ≢ 1 mod p and n^q ≡ 1 mod p.\n\nBut the user's original question is about both parts, so maybe we need to structure it as two separate formatted problems. However, the user's example had one problem, but perhaps here we can list both as separate problems under one answer. But the instructions say \"structure that problem as the following format\", implying one problem per answer. Given that, perhaps each part (a) and (b) should be separate. However, the user's question combines both parts, so perhaps we need to list them together.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants the entire proposition as one problem with the two cases handled in the assumptions. But the example didn't do that. It's a bit confusing. Given the example, even though it seems flawed, we need to proceed.\n\nGiven the user's example, they extracted the conditions from the problem and listed them as assumptions, even if they were part of the problem's original statement. So for the current problem:\n\nOriginal proposition has:\n\n- G is a group of order pq, p > q primes.\n\n- In part (a), q does not divide p-1.\n\n- In part (b), q divides p-1.\n\nSo for part (a), the assumptions would be:\n\n- G is a group.\n\n- The order of G is pq.\n\n- p and q are primes.\n\n- p > q.\n\n- q is not a divisor of p - 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that G is cyclic.\n\nFor part (b):\n\n- G is a group.\n\n- The order of G is pq.\n\n- p and q are primes.\n\n- p > q.\n\n- q is a divisor of p - 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that either G is cyclic or G is generated by elements a and b satisfying a^p = e, b^q = e, and ba = a^n b where n ≢ 1 mod p and n^q ≡ 1 mod p.\n\nBut the user's question is asking for the proof of the entire proposition. However, according to the user's example, each part should be structured separately. But the user's example combined an original problem into a formatted problem with added assumptions. Given the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to follow the user's example's approach, listing all the assumptions line by line, including those that are part of the problem's conditions, and then state the problem.\n\nBut the original problem is a proposition with two parts. The user is asking for a proof of both parts. Therefore, perhaps the answer should structure each part separately as per the format. However, since the user's example didn't split parts, maybe we need to present both parts together, listing the assumptions for each case.\n\nBut given the instructions to list each assumption line by line, and the problem statement, perhaps the answer should be structured as two separate formatted problems. However, the user's original question is about both parts. Therefore, maybe the answer should be:\n\nFor part (a):\n\nAssumption:\n\nG is a group,\n\nThe order of G is pq,\n\np and q are primes,\n\np > q,\n\nq is not a divisor of p - 1.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that G is cyclic.\n\nFor part (b):\n\nAssumption:\n\nG is a group,\n\nThe order of G is pq,\n\np and q are primes,\n\np > q,\n\nq is a divisor of p - 1.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that either G is cyclic or G is generated by elements a and b satisfying a^p = e, b^q = e, and ba = a^n b where n ≢ 1 mod p and n^q ≡ 1 mod p.\n\nThis way, each part is treated as a separate problem with its own assumptions and problem statement. But since the user's example had only one problem, maybe this is acceptable. However, the original question on Math Stack Exchange is about the entire proposition, so perhaps we need to present both parts in one formatted problem. But the example's format doesn't accommodate multiple parts. Given the example, the answer should probably split into two formatted problems. However, since the user hasn't specified, and the original question is a single proposition, perhaps we can list all assumptions together and then state both parts as the problem. But the example's format requires the problem to be a single statement.\n\nAlternatively, given the ambiguity, perhaps the safest way is to list all assumptions relevant to each part and present the respective problem statements.\n\nTherefore, after considering all this, the formatted answer should be as follows:",
