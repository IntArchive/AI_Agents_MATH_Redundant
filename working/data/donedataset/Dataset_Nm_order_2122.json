    "Content": "Suppose we have a function $\\phi : \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$, and a curve $\\gamma:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}^2$ defined by a level set of $\\phi$, ie. the codomain of $\\gamma$ is $\\{(x,y)\\mid\\phi(x,y)=C\\}$ for a given constant $C$. Edit: assume that $\\gamma$ is parameterized by arc length, so $\\left\\|\\gamma'(s)\\right\\|=1.$ The curvature of $\\gamma$ is defined as $$\\kappa(s)\\equiv\\left\\|T'(s)\\right\\|=\\left\\|\\gamma''(s)\\right\\|\\,\\,.$$ Show that it can also be written as\n$$\\kappa(s) = \\left|\\nabla\\cdot\\left(\\frac{\\nabla \\phi}{\\left|\\nabla\\phi\\right|}\\right)\\right|$$\nwhere $\\phi=\\phi\\left(\\gamma(s)\\right)$. (Note: not a homework problem.  I came across this while watching a youtube video on Level Set Methods )",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "From $\\| \\gamma'(s) \\| = 1$, it follows that $$0 = \\frac{d}{ds} \\langle \\gamma'(s),\\gamma'(s) \\rangle = 2\\langle \\gamma''(s),\\gamma'(s)\\rangle.$$\nSo $\\gamma'$ and $\\gamma''$ are perpendicular. Assume that $\\gamma''(s) \\neq 0$. Thus $N(s) := \\gamma''(s)/\\|\\gamma''(s)\\|$ locally defines a unit normal field to $\\gamma$. Since $\\gamma$ parametrizes a level set of $\\phi$ and $\\nabla \\phi$ is orthogonal to its level sets it follows that $\\nabla \\phi / \\|\\nabla \\phi\\|(\\gamma(s)) = \\pm N(s)$. Consequently \n$$\\kappa(s) = \\|\\gamma''(s)\\| = |\\langle \\gamma''(s),N(s)\\rangle| = |\\frac{d}{ds} \\langle \\gamma'(s),N(s)\\rangle - \\langle \\gamma'(s),\\frac{d}{ds}N(s)\\rangle| = |\\langle \\gamma'(s),\\frac{d}{ds} N(s)\\rangle|.$$\nSince $\\left\\|N(s)\\right\\| = 1$ it follows as for $\\gamma'$ that $\\langle N,\\frac{dN}{ds} \\rangle = 0$, thus $\\frac{dN}{ds}$ is a multiple of $\\gamma'$ and $\\left\\|\\frac{dN}{ds}\\right\\| = |\\langle \\gamma'(s),\\frac{dN}{ds}\\rangle|$. Thus \n$$\\kappa(s) = \\left\\|\\frac{dN}{ds}(s)\\right\\| = \\left\\|\\frac{d}{ds} \\frac{\\nabla \\phi}{\\|\\nabla \\phi\\|}\\right\\|.$$\nThus it remains to see that $|\\nabla \\cdot N| = \\left\\|\\frac{dN}{ds}\\right\\|$: For this one needs the following fact: Let $\\{b_i\\}$ be an orthonormal basis of $\\mathbb R^n$. Then $$\\nabla \\cdot X = \\sum_{i = 1}^n \\langle DX(b_i),b_i\\rangle$$\nfor any vectorfield $X : \\mathbb R^n \\to \\mathbb R^n$ with differential $DX$. Unfortunately (via google) I did not find a reference for this Edit: Using Riemannian geometry this follows since divergence is defined as the trace of the Levi Civita connection $\\nabla$, which on $\\mathbb R^n$ is given by $\\nabla_XY = DY(X)$ for vector fields $X,Y$. From this we see\n$$\\left\\|\\frac{dN}{ds}(s)\\right\\| = \\langle \\gamma'(s),\\frac{dN}{ds}(s)\\rangle = \\langle \\gamma'(s),DN(\\gamma'(s))\\rangle + \\langle N(s),DN(N(s))\\rangle = \\nabla \\cdot N(s).$$\nBy $DN$ we mean the differential of $N$ (note that strictly speaking this does not exists, as $N$ is only defined along $\\gamma$. But we can extend $N$ to a vectorfield defined on an open subset using $N = \\pm \\nabla \\phi/||\\nabla \\phi||$ as above). The second equality holds since $\\langle N,DN(X))\\rangle = 1/2\\partial_X\\langle N,N \\rangle = 0$ for any vector field $X$ ($\\partial_X$ denotes the directional derivative in direction $X$). Maybe these calculations are more complicated than they could be, but I don't see a simplification right away.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example provided shows how to list assumptions and then state the problem.\n\nFirst, I need to read the problem from Math Stack Exchange. The title is about proving that the curvature of a level set equals the divergence of the normalized gradient. The question explains that we have a function φ from R² to R, and a curve γ defined as a level set of φ, meaning γ is parameterized such that φ(γ(s)) = C. They also edited to mention that γ is parameterized by arc length, so the norm of γ'(s) is 1. The curvature κ is defined as the norm of the second derivative of γ, and they want to show that this curvature can be written as the absolute value of the divergence of (∇φ / |∇φ|).\n\nNow, I need to filter out the assumptions. Let's parse the problem step by step.\n\nAssumptions are conditions or properties applied to one object each. The first object is φ: it's a function from R² to R. That's one assumption. Then, γ is a curve defined as a level set of φ, so the codomain of γ is the set where φ(x,y)=C. That's another assumption. The user edited to add that γ is parameterized by arc length, so ||γ'(s)|| = 1. That's another assumption. The curvature κ is defined as the norm of T'(s), which is the same as the norm of γ''(s). Then, the problem is to show κ(s) equals the divergence of the normalized gradient.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n1. φ: R² → R is a function.\n2. γ: R → R² is a curve such that φ(γ(s)) = C for a constant C.\n3. γ is parameterized by arc length, so ||γ'(s)|| = 1.\n4. The curvature κ(s) is defined as ||T'(s)|| = ||γ''(s)||.\n\nWait, but the problem statement mentions that γ is a level set of φ, and that γ is parameterized by arc length. The user also notes that φ = φ(γ(s)), which is part of the problem's conclusion, but maybe not an assumption. The key assumptions are the ones given in the problem setup.\n\nSo breaking down:\n\n- φ is a function from R² to R. (Assumption 1)\n- γ is a curve defined by the level set φ(x,y) = C. So the codomain of γ is that set. (Assumption 2)\n- γ is parameterized by arc length, hence ||γ'(s)|| = 1. (Assumption 3)\n- Curvature κ(s) is defined as the norm of T'(s), which equals the norm of γ''(s). (Assumption 4)\n\nAdditionally, perhaps the problem requires that ∇φ is non-zero on the curve, because otherwise the normalized gradient (∇φ / |∇φ|) would be undefined. The original problem might implicitly assume that φ is smooth enough and that |∇φ| ≠ 0 along γ, to avoid division by zero. Since the user didn't mention this, but in standard level set methods, you usually assume that the gradient is non-zero on the level set to have a well-defined normal vector. So maybe that's another assumption. But the original problem as stated doesn't mention it. Hmm. The user might have missed that, but since the problem is from a YouTube video on level set methods, which typically requires that |∇φ| ≠ 0 on the level set. So maybe we should include that as an assumption.\n\nBut the original problem statement by the user does not explicitly state that. However, in the problem statement, they use ∇φ / |∇φ|, which requires |∇φ| ≠ 0. So perhaps that's an implicit assumption. Therefore, as a knowledgeable professor, I should include that assumption.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. φ: R² → R is a smooth function.\n2. γ: R → R² is a curve parameterized by arc length, so ||γ'(s)|| = 1.\n3. The image of γ is the level set {(x, y) | φ(x, y) = C} for some constant C.\n4. The gradient ∇φ is non-zero on the level set (i.e., |∇φ| ≠ 0 along γ).\n5. The curvature κ(s) is defined as ||γ''(s)||.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the user mentions \"Note: not a homework problem. I came across this while watching a youtube video on Level Set Methods\". So maybe in the context of level set methods, they usually assume smoothness and non-vanishing gradient. But the original problem didn't state these, but to make the problem well-posed, these are necessary. Therefore, as the assistant, I should include those assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem as stated by the user doesn't include these, but they are necessary for the problem to hold. So in structuring the problem, we need to list all necessary assumptions. However, the user's example didn't include implicit assumptions. For example, in the example given, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, no: the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption is \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal problem in example: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut in the formatted problem, the assumptions are \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that can't be. Wait, perhaps there was a mistake here. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which is not in the original. That seems like an error in the example. Wait, maybe the original problem was different. Wait, the user's example says:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nassumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nproblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems incorrect. Maybe the user made a mistake here. Because if you add \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, the problem becomes to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 under that assumption, but the original problem was for every integer n. So perhaps the example is wrong, but the user provided it as their own example.\n\nBut regardless, for the current problem, I need to follow their format. So perhaps they want to list explicit assumptions mentioned in the problem, not the implicit ones. Let's check the original problem again.\n\nThe original problem says:\n\n\"Suppose we have a function φ : R² → R, and a curve γ: R → R² defined by a level set of φ, i.e., the codomain of γ is {(x,y) | φ(x,y)=C} for a given constant C. Edit: assume that γ is parameterized by arc length, so ||γ'(s)||=1. The curvature of γ is defined as κ(s) ≡ ||T'(s)|| = ||γ''(s)||. Show that it can also be written as κ(s) = |∇ · (∇φ / |∇φ|)| where φ = φ(γ(s)).\"\n\nSo the given assumptions in the problem are:\n\n1. φ: R² → R.\n2. γ is a curve defined by the level set φ(x,y) = C.\n3. γ is parameterized by arc length, so ||γ'(s)|| = 1.\n4. Curvature κ(s) is defined as ||T'(s)|| = ||γ''(s)||.\n5. φ = φ(γ(s)) (note: this seems redundant since γ is in the level set, so φ(γ(s)) = C, but in the problem statement, they mention φ = φ(γ(s)) which is just restating that.\n\nBut to make the problem well-posed, additional assumptions are needed. However, according to the example provided by the user, even if the original problem states \"for every integer n\", they might add an extra assumption (like n divisible by 7) if necessary. Wait, but in that example, it seems the formatted problem is incorrect. Perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. But regardless, the user's instruction says to list all the assumptions from the problem, filtering unrelated information.\n\nIn the current problem, the assumptions mentioned in the original post are:\n\n- φ: R² → R.\n- γ is a level set of φ (codomain is φ(x,y)=C).\n- γ is parameterized by arc length (||γ'||=1).\n- Curvature κ(s) = ||γ''(s)||.\n\nAdditionally, the problem mentions \"Note: not a homework problem...\", which is unrelated. So those are the key assumptions.\n\nBut to define ∇φ / |∇φ|, we need ∇φ ≠ 0, so that should be an assumption. But the original problem didn't state it. However, in the problem statement, the user might have forgotten to mention it. But since the user wants to filter unrelated information and structure the problem, perhaps only the explicitly mentioned assumptions are to be listed.\n\nBut the example given by the user includes an assumption not present in the original problem. Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. It could be a mistake in the example. If I follow that example, perhaps I should include assumptions even if they are not explicitly stated but necessary for the problem. But since the user's example added an assumption not in the original problem, maybe in this case, we have to do the same.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems like the formatted problem is incorrect, as the original problem didn't restrict n to be divisible by 7. But perhaps there was a miscommunication. Maybe the original problem was different, but the user mistyped it. However, given the user's example, they included assumptions both from the problem and possibly additional ones.\n\nBut given the current problem, perhaps I should include all explicitly mentioned assumptions, even if they are redundant. For instance, the problem mentions γ is parameterized by arc length, which is an assumption. φ is a function from R² to R. The codomain of γ is the level set. The definition of curvature. Then, φ = φ(γ(s)) is part of the problem statement, not an assumption.\n\nAdditionally, the problem likely requires that ∇φ is non-zero, but since the user didn't mention it, perhaps it's not included. However, in the context of level set methods, this is a standard assumption. If we omit it, the problem might not hold, but the user might not have mentioned it. So as a professor, I need to decide whether to include it.\n\nBut according to the user's example, they included an assumption that was not in the original problem (n divisible by 7). Therefore, following that approach, perhaps I should include the assumption that ∇φ is non-zero along γ. But the original problem didn't state this. So perhaps this is a necessary assumption for the problem to be valid, and the user (as a professor) should include it.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. φ: R² → R is a function.\n2. γ: R → R² is a curve whose image is the level set {(x, y) | φ(x, y) = C}.\n3. γ is parameterized by arc length, so ||γ'(s)|| = 1.\n4. The gradient of φ, ∇φ, is non-zero on the level set {(x, y) | φ(x, y) = C}.\n5. The curvature κ(s) is defined as ||γ''(s)||.\n\nBut wait, the original problem doesn't mention the gradient being non-zero. So maybe the user expects to list only the explicitly stated assumptions. Let's check the original problem again:\n\nOriginal problem says:\n\n\"Suppose we have a function φ : R² → R, and a curve γ: R → R² defined by a level set of φ, i.e., the codomain of γ is {(x,y) | φ(x,y)=C} for a given constant C. Edit: assume that γ is parameterized by arc length, so ||γ'(s)||=1. The curvature of γ is defined as κ(s) ≡ ||T'(s)|| = ||γ''(s)||. Show that it can also be written as κ(s) = |∇ · (∇φ / |∇φ|)| where φ = φ(γ(s)).\"\n\nThe assumptions explicitly mentioned are:\n\n- φ is a function from R² to R.\n- γ is a level set curve of φ (codomain is φ(x,y)=C).\n- γ is arc-length parameterized (||γ'||=1).\n- Curvature is defined as ||γ''(s)||.\n\nThe problem statement doesn't mention ∇φ being non-zero, but to have the normalized gradient, ∇φ / |∇φ|, we must have |∇φ| ≠ 0. Therefore, this is an implicit assumption necessary for the problem to make sense. Therefore, as a professor, I should include it as an assumption.\n\nThus, the structured problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nφ is a function from R² to R,\nγ is a curve with codomain {(x,y) | φ(x,y)=C},\nγ is parameterized by arc length (||γ'(s)||=1),\nThe gradient ∇φ is non-zero on the level set {(x,y) | φ(x,y)=C},\nThe curvature κ(s) is defined as ||γ''(s)||.\n\nProblem:\nShow that κ(s) = |∇ · (∇φ / |∇φ|)| where φ = φ(γ(s)).\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"where φ = φ(γ(s))\", but since γ(s) is in the level set, φ(γ(s)) = C, a constant. So perhaps this is redundant, but it's part of the problem statement. However, in the problem part, it's stated as \"where φ = φ(γ(s))\", which is just specifying that we evaluate φ at the point γ(s). So maybe it's not an assumption but part of the problem's context.\n\nIn conclusion, the assumptions should include the non-vanishing gradient because it's necessary for the expression ∇φ / |∇φ| to be defined. Therefore, I will include that assumption.",
