    "Content": "For $\\mathbf x\\in\\mathbb (0,1)^n$ with $n>2$ and a positive integer $1\\le k<n$, define the mapping $f_{i,j}\\colon (0,1)^n\\rightarrow (0,1)$ by, $$f_{i,j}(\\mathbf x)= \\sum\\limits_{\\substack{\\mathcal A \\subset \\{ 1,\\ldots,n\\}\\backslash \\{i,j\\}\\\\  \n|\\mathcal A|=k-1}}\\quad\\left( \\prod\\limits_{l\\not\\in \\mathcal A\\cup \\{i,j\\} }x_l\\,\\,\\cdot\\!\\!\\!\\! \\prod\\limits_{ l\\in \\mathcal A}(1-x_l)\\right).$$ Convention: if the set of indexes is empty, the product is one. I'm trying to prove that the matrix $$M=\\begin{cases} m_{i,j}=f_{i,j}(\\mathbf{x})\\quad &\\text{ if } j\\neq i,\\\\ m_{i,j}=0&\\text{ if } j=i\\end{cases}$$ has full-rank, i.e. $\\det(M)\\neq 0$ (for $\\mathbf{x}$ in $(0,1)^n$). I proved this for two particular cases: $k=1$, $f_{i,j}(\\mathbf x)= \\prod\\limits_{ k\\neq i,j} x_k$ and so that case is quite easy. Also if $k=n-1$, $f_{i,j}(\\mathbf x)= \\prod\\limits_{ k\\neq i,j} (1-x_k)$, which is also an easy case. However, for $1<k<n-1$, I can only solve by using brute force. For example, for $k=2$ and $n=4$, the matrix is: $$\\left(\\begin{array}{cccc}0 & x_3(1-x_4)+x_4(1-x_3) & x_2(1-x_4)+x_4(1-x_2) & x_2(1-x_3)+x_3(1-x_2) \\\\\nx_3(1-x_4)+x_4(1-x_3) & 0 & x_1(1-x_4)+x_4(1-x_1) & x_1(1-x_3)+x_3(1-x_1) \\\\\nx_2(1-x_4)+x_4(1-x_2) & x_1(1-x_4)+x_4(1-x_1) & 0 & x_1(1-x_2)+x_2(1-x_1) \\\\x_2(1-x_3)+x_3(1-x_2)  & x_1(1-x_3)+x_3(1-x_1) & x_1(1-x_2)+x_2(1-x_1) & 0\\end{array}\\right),$$\nand using Mathematica, it can be shown that the determinant of $M$ is not zero for $\\mathbf x \\in (0,1)^4$. But I'm lost trying to tackle the general case: any suggestions/hints (i.e., they need to be full answers) are very welcome. Update : For several examples $-$ if we set $f_{i,j}(\\mathbf x,\\mathbf y)= \\sum\\limits_{\\substack{\\mathcal A \\subset \\{ 1,\\ldots,n\\}\\backslash \\{i,j\\}\\\\  \n|\\mathcal A|=k-1}}\\quad\\left( \\prod\\limits_{l\\not\\in \\mathcal A\\cup \\{i,j\\} }x_l\\,\\,\\cdot\\!\\!\\!\\! \\prod\\limits_{ l\\in \\mathcal A}y_l\\right)$, and compute the determinante of $M$ above. It is easy to see by inspection that all of terms of $\\mathrm{det}(M)$ have the same signal. Perhaps, it would be easier to prove the result for this more general $f_{i,j}$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I think you are asking if the matrix has full rank for all ${\\bf x}\\in (0,1)^n$. I can show that the matrix has full rank for some ${\\bf x}\\in (0,1)^n$. The matrix has full rank when all variables are assigned the same value $x\\in (0,1)$.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this problem and structure it according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a math professor, read the Math Stack Exchange question, filter out unrelated info, and format it into Assumptions and Problem sections.\n\nFirst, let's read the original question carefully. The title is \"Prove that determinant of a matrix (with polynomial entries) is non-zero\". The problem involves a matrix M defined for vectors x in (0,1)^n with n > 2. The matrix entries m_{i,j} are defined using a function f_{i,j} which is a sum over subsets of size k-1, with products of x_l and (1-x_l) terms. The user wants to prove that the determinant of M is non-zero, i.e., the matrix has full rank.\n\nNow, I need to list the assumptions. Each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. Let's break down the problem:\n\n1. The vector x is in (0,1)^n. So, that's an assumption on x.\n2. The integer n is greater than 2. So, assumption on n.\n3. The positive integer k satisfies 1 ≤ k < n. Assumption on k.\n4. The function f_{i,j} is defined with a sum over subsets A of size k-1, excluding {i,j}, and products over x_l and (1-x_l). The convention is that empty product is 1. So, the definition of f_{i,j} is part of the problem setup, which would be part of the problem statement rather than an assumption. Wait, but in the example given, the assumption included the condition that n is divisible by 7. So in the original problem, the assumptions are the conditions given for the problem to hold. Here, the conditions are that x is in (0,1)^n, n > 2, k is between 1 and n-1, and the matrix M is constructed as per the given function. However, the problem statement is to prove determinant is non-zero for all such x. So the assumptions would be the conditions that must hold for the problem to be valid. Let's list them:\n\nAssumptions:\n- x ∈ (0,1)^n (so each component of x is between 0 and 1)\n- n is an integer greater than 2\n- k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k < n\n- For each pair (i,j), m_{i,j} = f_{i,j}(x) if j ≠ i, and m_{i,j} = 0 if j = i\n- The function f_{i,j} is defined as the sum over all subsets A of size k-1 from {1,...,n}\\{i,j} of the product of x_l for l not in A ∪ {i,j} and product of (1 - x_l) for l in A. With the convention that empty product is 1.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"for x in (0,1)^n\", so that's an assumption. The parameters n, k are given as part of the problem setup. The definition of M is part of the problem's construction. However, in the example given by the user, they listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. So perhaps each individual condition should be broken down. Let's see:\n\nAssumptions:\n- n is an integer greater than 2\n- k is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ k < n\n- x is a vector in (0,1)^n\n- For each i ≠ j, the entry m_{i,j} is f_{i,j}(x) as defined\n- For each i, the diagonal entry m_{i,i} is 0\n- The function f_{i,j}(x) is defined by summing over all (k-1)-element subsets A of {1,...,n}\\{i,j}, multiplying products of x_l and (1 - x_l) as specified\n- The convention that an empty product equals 1\n\nBut the original question's problem statement already includes these elements. The challenge is to extract each assumption as a separate line. However, some of these are definitions rather than assumptions. For example, the definition of M is part of the problem setup, so perhaps the assumptions are the conditions that must hold for the problem to be considered, not the definitions. For example, in the example problem, the assumptions were that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7, even though the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7. Wait, no, the example given was the original problem having \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem had the assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems like a mistake, but perhaps the example was wrong. But according to the user's example, they modified the original problem's assumptions. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in their example? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\", which would actually restrict the problem. Maybe the example is incorrect, but regardless, we need to follow the user's instruction.\n\nIn any case, for the current problem, the user's original question is to prove that determinant of matrix M is non-zero for all x in (0,1)^n, given n>2 and 1 ≤k <n. The matrix is defined with m_{i,j}=0 on the diagonal and m_{i,j}=f_{i,j}(x) off-diagonal. The function f_{i,j} is defined with the sum over subsets of size k-1.\n\nSo the assumptions here are:\n\n- x ∈ (0,1)^n\n- n is an integer greater than 2\n- k is a positive integer with 1 ≤ k <n\n- Matrix M has m_{i,j}=f_{i,j}(x) when j≠i and m_{i,j}=0 when j=i\n- The function f_{i,j} is as defined with the sum over subsets of size k-1, products of x_l and (1-x_l), empty product is 1\n\nBut according to the user's example, each assumption line should address one property or condition applied to one object. So breaking down each condition:\n\nAssumption:\n- x is an element of (0,1)^n\n- n is an integer greater than 2\n- k is a positive integer\n- k satisfies 1 ≤ k < n\n- For each pair of distinct indices i and j, m_{i,j} = f_{i,j}(x)\n- For each index i, m_{i,i} = 0\n- The function f_{i,j}(x) is defined as the sum over all subsets A of {1,…,n} \\ {i,j} with size k-1 of the product of x_l for l not in A ∪ {i,j} and the product of (1 - x_l) for l in A\n- The empty product is defined to be 1\n\nBut perhaps some of these can be combined. For example, the definition of f_{i,j} includes the sum and product terms. But according to the example, the problem part includes the expression for A(n). So maybe the problem statement includes the definition of the function, and the assumptions are the conditions on n, k, x, and the structure of M.\n\nThus, the assumptions would be:\n\n- x ∈ (0,1)^n\n- n is an integer with n > 2\n- k is a positive integer with 1 ≤ k < n\n- Matrix M is defined such that m_{i,j} = f_{i,j}(x) for i ≠ j and m_{i,i} = 0, where f_{i,j}(x) is as defined in the problem statement\n\nBut the problem statement includes the definition of f_{i,j}, so perhaps that definition is part of the problem, not the assumptions. Wait, in the example, the problem part included the expression for A(n). So maybe the detailed definition of f_{i,j} is part of the problem statement. Therefore, the assumptions are the conditions that must be met, like x being in (0,1)^n, n>2, etc., while the definition of M and f_{i,j} is part of the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumptions:\n- x ∈ (0,1)^n\n- n is an integer greater than 2\n- k is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ k < n\n- For each pair of distinct indices i, j, m_{i,j} = f_{i,j}(x)\n- For each index i, m_{i,i} = 0\n\nProblem: Prove that the determinant of matrix M is non-zero for all x in (0,1)^n.\n\nBut wait, the original problem defines f_{i,j} with a specific sum. That definition is part of the problem's setup, so maybe it should be included in the problem statement. For example, in the example given by the user, the problem part includes the expression for A(n). Therefore, the problem statement here should include the definition of f_{i,j} and M. However, the user's format example includes the problem part as the actual statement to prove, which includes the mathematical expression. So the problem part here should be:\n\nProblem: Prove that the matrix M, defined as m_{i,j} = f_{i,j}(x) for i ≠ j and m_{i,i} = 0, where f_{i,j}(x) is given by [the sum expression], has non-zero determinant for all x ∈ (0,1)^n.\n\nBut to fit this concisely, perhaps we need to structure it properly. The challenge is to balance including necessary details without making the problem statement too verbose. Given that the original problem already defines f_{i,j}, and the example includes the mathematical expression in the problem statement, I think that the problem statement here should include the definition of f_{i,j} and M, similar to how the example included the expression for A(n).\n\nThus, the formatted problem would have the assumptions as the conditions on n, k, x, and the structure of M (diagonal zero, off-diagonal f_{i,j}), and the problem part would state to prove that det(M) ≠ 0, with the definition of f_{i,j} included in the problem statement.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n- x is an element of (0,1)^n\n- n is an integer greater than 2\n- k is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ k < n\n- For each pair of distinct indices i and j, the entry m_{i,j} equals f_{i,j}(x)\n- For each index i, the entry m_{i,i} is 0\n\nProblem: Prove that the determinant of the matrix M is non-zero, where f_{i,j}(x) is defined as the sum over all subsets A of {1,…,n} \\ {i,j} with size k-1 of the product of x_l for l not in A ∪ {i,j} and the product of (1 - x_l) for l in A, with the convention that an empty product equals 1.\n\nAlternatively, to make it more concise, perhaps the problem statement can include the formula for f_{i,j} as in the original question. But the example given by the user includes the mathematical expression within the problem statement, so I should follow that.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem would look like:\n\nAssumption:\n- x ∈ (0,1)^n\n- n is an integer greater than 2\n- k is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ k < n\n- For each i ≠ j, m_{i,j} = f_{i,j}(x)\n- For each i, m_{i,i} = 0\n\nProblem: Prove that the matrix M, defined as above, has non-zero determinant (i.e., det(M) ≠ 0) for all x in (0,1)^n, where f_{i,j}(x) is given by $$f_{i,j}(\\mathbf x)= \\sum\\limits_{\\substack{\\mathcal A \\subset \\{ 1,\\ldots,n\\}\\backslash \\{i,j\\}\\\\ |\\mathcal A|=k-1}} \\left( \\prod\\limits_{l\\not\\in \\mathcal A\\cup \\{i,j\\} }x_l \\cdot \\prod\\limits_{ l\\in \\mathcal A}(1-x_l)\\right).$$ Convention: if the set of indices is empty, the product is one.\n\nBut the user's example included the mathematical expression within the problem part. Hence, the problem part should include the formula for f_{i,j} and the structure of M. However, the user's example had the expression for A(n) in the problem statement. So in this case, the problem statement should include the definition of M and f_{i,j}. Therefore, the assumptions are the conditions on x, n, k, and the structure of M (zero diagonal, off-diagonal entries as f_{i,j}), while the problem statement includes the detailed definition of f_{i,j} and the goal to prove det(M) ≠ 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the definition of f_{i,j} is part of the assumptions. But in the example, the assumption was \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", while the problem included the expression. Therefore, to follow the user's example, the problem part should include the formula, and the assumptions list the conditions on variables and structure.\n\nTherefore, after careful consideration, here's the formatted problem:\n\nAssumption:\n- x is an element of (0,1)^n\n- n is an integer greater than 2\n- k is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ k < n\n- Matrix M has m_{i,j} = 0 when j = i\n- For j ≠ i, m_{i,j} is defined as f_{i,j}(x)\n\nProblem: Prove that the determinant of matrix M is non-zero for all x in (0,1)^n, where $$f_{i,j}(\\mathbf x)= \\sum\\limits_{\\substack{\\mathcal A \\subset \\{ 1,\\ldots,n\\}\\backslash \\{i,j\\}\\\\ |\\mathcal A|=k-1}} \\left( \\prod\\limits_{l\\not\\in \\mathcal A\\cup \\{i,j\\} }x_l \\cdot \\prod\\limits_{ l\\in \\mathcal A}(1-x_l)\\right)$$ with the convention that an empty product equals one.\n\nThis way, the assumptions list the conditions on x, n, k, and the structure of M, while the problem includes the definition of f_{i,j} and the goal to prove det(M) ≠ 0. Each assumption is a single line addressing one property or condition.",
