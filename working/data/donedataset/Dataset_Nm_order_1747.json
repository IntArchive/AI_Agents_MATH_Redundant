    "Content": "Recently, I was informed that we can verify the famous formula about $\\mathrm{lcm}(a,b)$ and $\\gcd(a,b)$ which is $$\\mathrm{lcm}(a,b)=\\frac{|ab|}{\\gcd(a,b)} $$ via group theory. The least common multiple of two integers $a$ and $b$, usually denoted by $\\mathrm{lcm}(a,b)$ , is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both $a$ and $b$ and the greatest common divisor ($\\gcd$) , of two or more non-zero integers, is the largest positive integer that divides the numbers without a remainder. I do not know if we can prove this equation by using the groups or not, but if we can I am eager to know the way someone face it. Thanks.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Lemma. Let $G$ be a group, written multiplicatively, and let $H$ and $K$ be two subgroups. If $HK = \\{hk\\mid h\\in H, k\\in K\\}$, then\n$$|HK||H\\cap K| = |H||K|$$in the sense of cardinalities. Proof. Consider the map $H\\times K\\to HK$ given by $(h,k)\\mapsto hk$. I claim that the map is exactly $|H\\cap K|$ to $1$. Indeed, if $hk=h'k'$, then $h'^{-1}h = k'k^{-1}\\in H\\cap K$, so there exists $u\\in H\\cap K$, namely $u=h'^{-1}h$ such that $h=h'u$ and $k=u^{-1}k'$. Thus, $(h,k) = (h'u,u^{-1}k')$ maps to the same thing as $(h',k')$. Conversely, given $v\\in H\\cap K$, we have that $(h'v,v^{-1}k')\\in H\\times K$ maps to the same thing as $(h',k')$. Thus, each element of $HK$ corresponds to precisely $|H\\cap K|$ elements of $H\\times K$. Thus, $|HK||H\\cap K| = |H\\times K| = |H||K|$, as claimed. $\\Box$ Let $a$ and $b$ be integers, and consider $\\mathbb{Z}/\\langle ab\\rangle$. This is a group with $|ab|$ elements. This group contains subgroups generated by $\\gcd(a,b)$, by $a$, by $b$, and by $\\mathrm{lcm}(a,b)$. $\\gcd(a,b)$ generates the largest subgroup containing both $a$ and $b$; i.e., $\\langle \\gcd(a,b)\\rangle = \\langle a\\rangle + \\langle b\\rangle$; while $\\mathrm{lcm}(a,b)$ generates the smallest subgroup contained in both $\\langle a\\rangle$ and $\\langle b\\rangle$, i.e., $\\langle \\mathrm{lcm}(a,b)\\rangle = \\langle a\\rangle\\cap\\langle b\\rangle$. By the Lemma (with addition, since we are working in an additive group), we have:\n$$|\\langle a\\rangle+\\langle b\\rangle| |\\langle a\\rangle\\cap\\langle b\\rangle| = |\\langle a\\rangle||\\langle b\\rangle|$$\nNow, the subgroup generated by $\\gcd(a,b)$ has $\\frac{|ab|}{\\gcd(a,b)}$ elements; the subgroup generated by $\\mathrm{lcm}(a,b)$ has $\\frac{|ab|}{\\mathrm{lcm}(a,b)}$ elements; that generated by $a$ has $\\frac{|ab|}{|a|}$ elements, that generated by $b$ has $\\frac{|ab|}{|b|}$ elements. Plugging all of that in it becomes\n$$\\gcd(a,b)\\mathrm{lcm}(a,b) = |a||b|$$\nwhich yields the desired equality.\n $\\Box$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original question is about proving the formula lcm(a, b) * gcd(a, b) = |ab| using group theory. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The problem statement mentions that a and b are integers, and the formula involves gcd and lcm. The user in the example listed assumptions per line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So, here, the assumptions would likely be that a and b are integers, and maybe that they are non-zero since gcd is defined for non-zero integers. But wait, the original problem statement mentions \"two or more non-zero integers\" for gcd. So, maybe we need to include that a and b are non-zero.\n\nAlso, the problem is to prove the formula via group theory. The original question mentions using group theory, so that's part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- a and b are integers\n- a and b are non-zero (since gcd is for non-zero integers)\n- The formula relates to group theory concepts\n\nWait, but in the example provided, the assumptions were about the variables involved. For instance, in the example, n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. So here, the assumptions would be about a and b being integers, non-zero, perhaps. But the original problem statement doesn't specify any additional conditions on a and b except that they are integers (but gcd is usually defined for non-zero integers). However, the user's example might not include all possible assumptions unless explicitly stated. Wait, the original problem says \"for two or more non-zero integers\" when defining gcd, but the formula here is for two integers. So, perhaps the assumptions are that a and b are non-zero integers. That's important because if either a or b is zero, the gcd and lcm might not be defined in the standard way.\n\nSo, the assumptions should be:\n\n- a is a non-zero integer\n- b is a non-zero integer\n\nBecause if a or b is zero, the formula might not hold, and gcd(0, b) is |b|, but lcm(0, b) is 0, so 0 * |b| = 0, which equals |0 * b| = 0, but the formula still holds. However, typically, gcd and lcm are considered for non-zero integers to avoid trivial cases. The original question mentions \"non-zero integers\" in the definition of gcd, so the problem likely assumes a and b are non-zero.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\na and b are non-zero integers.\n\nBut each assumption should be on one line, applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\na is a non-zero integer,\nb is a non-zero integer.\n\nProblem: Prove via group theory that $$\\mathrm{lcm}(a,b) \\cdot \\gcd(a,b) = |ab|.$$\n\nWait, the original problem's title is \"Proof via Group Theory : lcm(a,b) * gcd(a,b) = |ab|\", so the problem is to prove that equation using group theory. The user's formatted example includes the problem statement with the formula and the method (group theory). So the problem line should include the \"via group theory\" part.\n\nTherefore, the structured problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\na is a non-zero integer,\nb is a non-zero integer.\n\nProblem: Prove via group theory that $$\\mathrm{lcm}(a,b) \\cdot \\gcd(a,b) = |ab|.$$\n\nI think that's correct. The key points are that a and b are non-zero integers (as per the gcd definition given in the question), and the problem is to prove the formula using group theory. Each assumption is on its own line, addressing one property per object. So that's the formatted version.",
