    "Content": "If $P\\in\\mathbb{C}[z]$ is a non-zero polynomial, prove $f(z):=e^{z}-P(z)$ has infinitely many zeros. I've made some progress so far, but I still have a step missing. Here is where I'm at: Suppose $f$ has finitely many zeros, namely $z=a_1,\\,...\\,,a_n \\neq 0$ and possibly $z=0$ . Since $e^z$ and $P(z)$ are entire functions with orders of growth $1$ and $0$ respectively, then $f$ has order of growth $1$ . From Hadamard's factorization: $$f(z)=e^{\\alpha z+\\beta}z^m\\prod_{k=1}^{n}\\left(1-\\frac{z}{a_k}\\right) e^{\\left(\\frac{z}{a_k}\\right)} \\tag{$*$}$$ (where $\\alpha$ , $\\beta$ are complex constants and $m:=$ multiplicity of $z=0$ ). Rearranging $(*)$ , we get: $$f(z)=e^{\\gamma z+\\beta}Q(z)\\tag{$**$}$$ (where $\\gamma = \\alpha +\\sum_{k=1}^{n}\\frac{1}{a_k}$ is a constant and $Q(z)=z^m\\prod_{k=1}^{n}\\left(1-\\frac{z}{a_k}\\right)$ is a polynomial of degree $m+n$ ) Now, for $d:=\\text{deg}(P)$ , notice $f^{(d+1)}(z)=e^{z}$ . Taking the $(d+1)$ -th derivative in $(**)$ , we get $e^{z}=e^{\\gamma z+\\beta}R(z)$ , where $R$ is a polynomial of degree $m+n$ . If $m+n\\geq 1$ , $R$ has at least one root, while $e^{z}$ has none (absurd), so $m+n=0\\Rightarrow m=n=0\\Rightarrow f$ has no zeros. Conclusion: either $f$ has infinitely many zeros or none at all. Now how can I prove it has at least $1$ zero?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "$P\\neq0$ only has finitely many roots, so the function $$\ng:z\\mapsto\\frac{\\exp(1/z)}{P(1/z)}\n$$ is well defined on a neighbourhood of $0$ (without $0$), has an essential singularity at $0$, and does not vanish. Since it is an analytic function, Great Picard's theorem holds, and $g$ takes all complex values infinitely often except at most one. In particular, $1$ is reached infinitely many times.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format, which includes listing assumptions and stating the problem clearly. \n\nFirst, I need to read through the original problem carefully. The problem is about proving that the function \\( f(z) = e^z - P(z) \\), where \\( P \\) is a non-zero polynomial, has infinitely many zeros. The user has already made some progress using Hadamard's factorization theorem and derived a contradiction if we assume finitely many zeros, leading to the conclusion that either there are infinitely many zeros or none. The missing step is showing there's at least one zero.\n\nNow, I need to filter out the unnecessary information and structure it according to the example provided. The example shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. The problem statement is then simplified.\n\nLooking at the original problem: the key elements are that \\( P \\) is a non-zero polynomial in \\( \\mathbb{C}[z] \\), and \\( f(z) = e^z - P(z) \\). The user's progress involves entire functions, orders of growth, Hadamard's factorization, derivatives, and contradictions regarding zeros. However, for the assumptions in the formatted problem, I need to extract only the given conditions, not the steps taken in the attempt.\n\nSo the main assumptions here are:\n1. \\( P \\) is a non-zero polynomial.\n2. \\( P \\) is an element of \\( \\mathbb{C}[z] \\).\n3. The function \\( f(z) \\) is defined as \\( e^z - P(z) \\).\n\nThese are the basic assumptions provided in the problem statement. The rest of the details in the question are part of the user's attempt and progress, which shouldn't be included in the assumptions. The problem itself is to prove that \\( f(z) \\) has infinitely many zeros.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included specific conditions like divisibility by 7, which was part of the original problem's statement. Here, the original problem states that \\( P \\) is a non-zero polynomial in \\( \\mathbb{C}[z] \\), so those are the primary assumptions. The user's steps involving Hadamard's theorem and such are part of their attempt, not the problem's inherent assumptions. Therefore, the formatted problem's assumptions should only include the given conditions from the problem statement, not the user's derived steps.\n\nTherefore, the correct assumptions are:\n- \\( P \\) is a non-zero polynomial.\n- \\( P \\) is in \\( \\mathbb{C}[z] \\).\n- \\( f(z) \\) is defined as \\( e^z - P(z) \\).\n\nBut wait, in the example, the assumption included an extra condition (divisible by 7) which was part of the problem's original statement. But in this case, the problem as stated in the title and the first line is: \"If \\( P \\in \\mathbb{C}[z] \\) is a non-zero polynomial, prove \\( f(z):=e^{z}-P(z) \\) has infinitely many zeros.\" So the only assumptions here are that \\( P \\) is a non-zero polynomial over the complex numbers, and \\( f \\) is defined as such. The rest of the text is the user's attempt. Therefore, the formatted problem should list those as assumptions.\n\nBut looking at the example again: the original problem mentioned that \\( n \\) is an integer, and in the formatted problem, that was an assumption. However, in the example, the problem had an additional assumption (n divisible by 7) which was not in the original problem. Wait, no. The original problem in the example was to prove that for every integer \\( n \\), the expression is divisible by 91. The user formatted it with an assumption that \\( n \\) is an integer and \\( n \\) is divisible by 7, but that seems incorrect because the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7. Wait, actually, looking back:\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut the formatted problem had assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. However, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is an integer\" but the \"divisible by 7\" was perhaps a mistake? Wait, no, perhaps the example was structured incorrectly? Wait, the user provided an example where they structured the problem with assumptions, but in the original problem, there was no assumption that n is divisible by 7. So that seems like an error in the example. However, maybe the user intended to present a problem where n is divisible by 7? Maybe the example was from a different problem. But assuming that the example is correct as per the user's instruction, the process is: list all assumptions from the problem, each as a separate line.\n\nBut in the current problem, the original problem states that P is a non-zero polynomial in C[z], so the assumptions are:\n\n- P is a non-zero polynomial.\n- P ∈ ℂ[z].\n- f(z) = e^z − P(z).\n\nBut perhaps the third point is part of the problem definition rather than an assumption. Wait, in the example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, with assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in the original example, the problem was for every integer n, so n being an integer is an assumption. The user might have mistakenly added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Therefore, perhaps the example is not a good model. But regardless, according to the user's example, assumptions are the given conditions.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's original question is: If P ∈ ℂ[z] is a non-zero polynomial, prove f(z):=e^{z}−P(z) has infinitely many zeros. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- P is a non-zero polynomial.\n- P ∈ ℂ[z].\n\nThe problem is to prove f(z) has infinitely many zeros.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". However, in the original problem in the example, it was \"for every integer n\", so n being an integer is part of the problem's universal quantification, but the user added \"n is divisible by 7\" which wasn't in the original. So perhaps the example is incorrect. Therefore, maybe I should follow the user's instruction but use the actual problem's conditions.\n\nTherefore, in the given problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- P is a non-zero polynomial.\n- P is an element of ℂ[z].\n\nThe problem is to prove that f(z) = e^z - P(z) has infinitely many zeros.\n\nBut in the user's attempt, they mention that if f has finitely many zeros, then through Hadamard's theorem, etc., but that's part of their solution steps, not assumptions.\n\nSo, following the user's example (even if the example might have an error), the task is to list the assumptions as per the problem's given conditions. The problem says \"If P is a non-zero polynomial in ℂ[z], prove...\", so the assumptions are that P is non-zero, P is in ℂ[z], and the function is defined as e^z - P(z). But in the example, the function definition was part of the problem statement. So perhaps the third assumption is part of the problem's setup.\n\nTherefore, the formatted assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\nP is a non-zero polynomial,\nP ∈ ℂ[z],\nf(z) is defined as e^z - P(z).\n\nProblem:\nProve that f(z) has infinitely many zeros.\n\nWait, but the original problem didn't state any additional conditions on f(z) other than its definition. Therefore, those three points are the assumptions.\n\nBut the user's example included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (n divisible by 7). That might have been a mistake, but since the user provided that example, perhaps in their formatting, they included both the universal condition (n is an integer) and an added assumption (n divisible by 7). But in the original example problem, the user was supposed to structure it with assumptions. Wait, the original example problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem's assumption lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" But that doesn't make sense because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which doesn't restrict n to be divisible by 7. So perhaps the user made an error in their example. However, given that, I need to follow the user's instructions as per the example, even if the example might be flawed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended in the example to filter out the problem's actual conditions. Wait, maybe the original problem had a different assumption. Wait, maybe the original example problem was different. The user wrote:\n\nOriginal problem:\nProve that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nassumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut in reality, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so n is any integer, not necessarily divisible by 7. So the user's formatted problem in the example is incorrect. Therefore, maybe the user intended to show how to structure, but their example is wrong. Therefore, I should focus on the actual problem given here.\n\nIn the current problem, the original problem is: If P ∈ ℂ[z] is a non-zero polynomial, prove that f(z) = e^z - P(z) has infinitely many zeros. Therefore, the assumptions are that P is a non-zero polynomial in ℂ[z], and f is defined as e^z - P(z). So, in the formatted problem:\n\nAssumption:\nP is a non-zero polynomial,\nP ∈ ℂ[z],\nf(z) is defined as e^z - P(z).\n\nProblem:\nProve that f(z) has infinitely many zeros.\n\nBut the third assumption is part of the problem statement, so perhaps it's redundant. Alternatively, in the example, the function A(n) was defined, which was part of the problem statement. So in this case, defining f(z) as e^z - P(z) is part of the problem's setup. Therefore, including it as an assumption makes sense.\n\nHence, the formatted problem should have the three assumptions listed, each on a separate line, and the problem statement as given.\n\nBut let's check the example again. In the example, the original problem was about A(n) being divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem's assumptions were \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" But the original problem's actual assumption is that n is any integer. Therefore, the example is incorrect. The user probably made a mistake there. However, given that, I need to follow the instruction to list all assumptions of the problem, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nIn the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\n1. P is a non-zero polynomial.\n2. P is in ℂ[z].\n3. f(z) is defined as e^z - P(z).\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nP is a non-zero polynomial,\nP ∈ ℂ[z],\nf(z) = e^z - P(z).\n\nProblem:\nProve that f(z) has infinitely many zeros.\n\nBut the original problem statement says \"If P ∈ ℂ[z] is a non-zero polynomial, prove f(z):=e^{z}-P(z) has infinitely many zeros.\" So the assumptions are exactly those three points.\n\nHowever, in the example provided by the user, they added an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) which wasn't in the original problem. This seems like an error. But since the user provided that example, maybe they intended to show how to list all conditions, even if some are implicit. But in the current problem, there are no hidden assumptions; the conditions are all given explicitly.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatted problem should be as above. I think that's the accurate structure based on the problem given.",
