    "Content": "A few answers here on math.SE have used as an intermediate step the following inequality that is due to Walter Gautschi: $$x^{1-s} < \\frac{\\Gamma(x+1)}{\\Gamma(x+s)} < (x+1)^{1-s},\\qquad x > 0,\\; 0 < s < 1$$ Unfortunately, the paper that the DLMF is pointing to is not easily accessible. How might this inequality be proven?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I'll probably leave this standing for two days before posting a summary of Gautschi's paper. Here is the long-overdue follow-through. I have slightly changed a few notations, but this is otherwise Gautschi's original argument. What Gautschi actually proves in his paper is the more general inequality $$\\exp((s-1)\\psi(n+1))\\le\\frac{\\Gamma(n+s)}{\\Gamma(n+1)}\\le n^{s-1},\\; 0\\le s\\le1,n\\in\\mathbb Z^{+}\\tag{1}\\label{1}$$ where $\\psi(n)$ is the digamma function. Gautschi considers the function $$f(s)=\\frac1{1-s}\\log\\left(\\frac{\\Gamma(n+s)}{\\Gamma(n+1)}\\right)$$ over $0\\le s <1$, from which we have $f(0)=\\log(1/n)$ and $$\\lim_{s\\to 1}f(s)=-\\psi(n+1)$$ via l'Hôpital. Then we have $$(1-s)f'(s)=f(s)+\\psi(n+s)$$ and then by letting $$\\varphi(s)=(1-s)(f(s)+\\psi(n+s))$$ we have $\\varphi(0)=\\psi(n)-\\log n<0$, $\\varphi(1)=0$, and $\\varphi'(s)=(1-s)\\,\\psi ^{(1)}(n+s)$ (where $\\psi ^{(1)}(n)$ is the trigamma function). Now, since $\\psi ^{(1)}(n+s)=\\psi ^{(1)}(s)-\\sum\\limits_{k=0}^{n-1}\\frac1{(s+k)^2}$ is always positive, we have that $\\varphi(s)<0$, from which we deduce that $f(s)$ is monotonically decreasing over $0<s<1$ (i.e., $f'(s)<0$). Therefore $$-\\psi(n+1)\\le f(s)\\le\\log\\frac1{n}$$ which is equivalent to $\\eqref{1}$. The inequality in the OP can then be deduced from the inequality $\\psi(n)<\\log n$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me start by reading the original question carefully. The user is asking about proving Gautschi's inequality for the gamma function. The inequality provided is:\n\n$$x^{1-s} < \\frac{\\Gamma(x+1)}{\\Gamma(x+s)} < (x+1)^{1-s},\\qquad x > 0,\\; 0 < s < 1$$\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The assumptions should each address one property or condition applied to one object. Looking at the inequality, the conditions are given as x > 0 and 0 < s < 1. So these are two separate assumptions. Also, the objects here are x and s. \n\nWait, the original problem states that x is greater than 0 and s is between 0 and 1. So each of these should be separate lines under assumptions. The user also mentions that the inequality is due to Gautschi and is used as an intermediate step, but those details might not be necessary for the assumptions. The problem part should just restate the inequality to be proven.\n\nLet me check the example provided. In the example, the original problem had an A(n) expression, and the assumptions were that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Wait, in that example, the user had to split the assumptions even if they were both about n. So each condition on the same object should be separate lines.\n\nIn this case, x is a real number greater than 0, and s is a real number between 0 and 1. So each of those should be separate assumptions. Let me verify if there are any other implicit assumptions. The gamma function is involved, so maybe we need to assume that x and x+s are in the domain where the gamma function is defined. But since x > 0 and s is between 0 and 1, x+s is also greater than 0, so Gamma(x+s) is defined. So perhaps the explicit assumptions are just x > 0 and 0 < s < 1.\n\nSo the assumptions should be:\n\n- x is a real number greater than 0.\n- s is a real number between 0 and 1.\n\nWait, but in the example, they wrote \"$n$ is an integer,\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7.\" So each condition on n is a separate line. Similarly here, x > 0 is one line, and 0 < s < 1 is another line. But the variables x and s are separate objects. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number,\nx is greater than 0,\ns is a real number,\ns is between 0 and 1.\n\nBut wait, in the example, they just wrote \"$n$ is an integer,\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7.\" So maybe for each object, list each of their conditions. Since x is a real number and x > 0. But in the example, n was an integer, which is a type, and then a condition. So perhaps here, the assumptions would be:\n\nx is a real number with x > 0,\n\ns is a real number with 0 < s < 1.\n\nBut the user's format says each assumption addresses only one property or condition applied to one object. So maybe splitting into:\n\nx is a real number,\n\nx > 0,\n\ns is a real number,\n\n0 < s < 1.\n\nBut maybe that's overdoing it. Alternatively, perhaps \"x is a real number greater than 0\" is one assumption, and \"s is a real number between 0 and 1\" is another. Since each assumption addresses only one object (x and s). The original problem states x > 0 and 0 < s < 1. So I think that's how it should be. So:\n\nAssumption:\nx is greater than 0,\ns is between 0 and 1.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"x > 0\" and \"0 < s < 1\". So each is a separate assumption. But according to the example, they split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" into two lines. So even if both conditions are on the same object, they split them. Here, x and s are different objects, so each has their own conditions. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\nx > 0,\n\n0 < s < 1.\n\nBut maybe need to specify that x and s are real numbers. The original problem didn't state that, but since they are dealing with the gamma function, which is typically defined for real numbers (except non-positive integers). So maybe the assumptions are:\n\nx is a real number,\n\nx > 0,\n\ns is a real number,\n\n0 < s < 1.\n\nBut the problem statement in the original question just says \"x > 0, 0 < s < 1\". So perhaps the user expects that x and s are real numbers by default. However, in the example, the user didn't have to specify that n is an integer because the problem stated \"for every integer n\". So maybe here, since the problem says \"x > 0, 0 < s < 1\", the assumptions are:\n\nx > 0,\n\n0 < s < 1.\n\nBut to be precise, we should note that x and s are real numbers. So maybe:\n\nx is a real number greater than 0,\n\ns is a real number between 0 and 1.\n\nBut according to the example's structure, the first assumption was \"$n$ is an integer,\" which is a type and a condition. So here, for x and s, we need to state that they are real numbers with those conditions. So:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number,\nx > 0,\ns is a real number,\n0 < s < 1.\n\nBut the original problem's conditions are \"x > 0, 0 < s < 1\". The user didn't specify they are real numbers, but in mathematical contexts, unless stated otherwise, variables are real unless specified. However, since the gamma function can sometimes be considered for complex arguments, but in this inequality, it's for x > 0, so real x. So perhaps it's safe to include that x and s are real. But the problem statement might not have that explicitly. Let me check the original question again.\n\nOriginal question: \"How do you prove Gautschi's inequality for the gamma function?\" Then the inequality is given with \"x > 0, 0 < s < 1\". So perhaps in the problem statement, the user assumes x and s are real numbers. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\nx > 0,\n\n0 < s < 1.\n\nBut in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", and the formatted assumption was \"$n$ is an integer\". So here, since the original problem says \"x > 0, 0 < s < 1\", the formatted assumptions should be \"x > 0\" and \"0 < s < 1\". Because each of those addresses one condition on one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nx is greater than 0,\ns is between 0 and 1.\n\nBut to make it clear as separate lines, each addressing one condition on one object, the correct way would be:\n\nx > 0,\n\n0 < s < 1.\n\nEach line is a separate assumption on different objects. So that's two assumptions.\n\nThen the problem is to prove the inequality:\n\n$$x^{1-s} < \\frac{\\Gamma(x+1)}{\\Gamma(x+s)} < (x+1)^{1-s}$$\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nx > 0,\n0 < s < 1.\nProblem:\nProve that $$x^{1-s} < \\frac{\\Gamma(x+1)}{\\Gamma(x+s)} < (x+1)^{1-s}$$ for x > 0 and 0 < s < 1.\n\nWait, but in the example, the problem statement includes the variables but doesn't repeat the conditions in the problem line. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem lists the assumptions and then the problem is to prove the divisibility. The problem line doesn't repeat \"for every integer n\" because the assumptions already state that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Wait, but in that example, the user modified the original problem. The original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe that was a mistake in the example?\n\nWait, in the user's example, the original problem was: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem's assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, but that changes the problem. The original problem was for all integers n, but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. That seems like an error. Maybe the user made a mistake in their example? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That changes the problem's scope. So perhaps the example is incorrect. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instruction.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question states the conditions x > 0 and 0 < s < 1. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumptions should list those conditions, each as a separate line. Then, the problem is to prove the inequality. So the problem line would just state the inequality without repeating the conditions, since they are covered in the assumptions.\n\nBut in the example, the problem line included \"for every integer n\", but the assumption was \"n is an integer\". So perhaps the problem line in the example still included \"for every integer n\" even though the assumption was already listed. Wait, no. The example's problem line was:\n\n\"Prove that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$ is divisible by 91.\"\n\nBut the original problem was \"for every integer n\", and the formatted problem's assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". So the problem line doesn't include \"for every integer n\" anymore. Therefore, the problem line is just the statement to prove, with the conditions listed as assumptions.\n\nTherefore, in this case, the problem line should be \"Prove that [inequality]\" without the \"x > 0 and 0 < s < 1\" part, since those are in the assumptions.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nx > 0,\n0 < s < 1.\nProblem:\nProve that $$x^{1-s} < \\frac{\\Gamma(x+1)}{\\Gamma(x+s)} < (x+1)^{1-s}.$$\n\nBut let me check if the problem needs to restate the variables. In the example, the problem line includes the expression with n, but the assumptions are about n. So here, the inequality is in terms of x and s, and the assumptions are about x and s. Therefore, the problem line should just state the inequality without repeating the variable conditions.\n\nThus, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nx > 0,\n0 < s < 1.\nProblem:\nProve that $$x^{1-s} < \\frac{\\Gamma(x+1)}{\\Gamma(x+s)} < (x+1)^{1-s}.$$\n\nI think that's correct. Each assumption is one line, addressing one condition on one object. The problem line states the inequality to be proven.",
