    "Content": "One of my homework questions was to prove, from the axioms of ZF only, that a countable union of countable sets does not have cardinality $\\aleph_2$. My solution shows that it does not have cardinality $\\aleph_n$, where $n$ is any non-zero ordinal (not necessarily finite). I have a sneaking suspicion that my solution is actually invalid, but I can't find any reference which invalidates my conclusion. I have read that it is provable in ZF that there are no cardinals $\\kappa$ such that $\\aleph_0 < \\kappa < \\aleph_1$, but I believe the conclusion of my proof does not preclude the possibility that the cardinality is incomparable to $\\aleph_1$ or some such. I think the weakest point in my solution is where I claim that the supremum of a countable set of countable ordinals is again countable. This is true, of course, but it sounds uncomfortably close to the claim \"a countable union of countable sets is countable\", which is well-known to be unprovable in ZF. Can anybody confirm that the ordinal version is provable in ZF though? If not, I think I can weaken the claim to \"the supremum of any set of countable ordinals is at most $\\omega_1$\", and this establishes the weaker result that the cardinality of a countable union of countable sets is not $\\aleph_n$ for any ordinal $n \\ge 2$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The ordinal $\\omega_1$ can (consistently) be a countable union of countable ordinals, i.e., the supremum of a countable set of countable ordinals. This consistency result was one of the first found with forcing. It was announced in S. Feferman-A. Levy, \"Independence results in set theory by Cohen's method II\", Notices Amer Math Soc., 10, (1963) 593. The result is that it is consistent with $\\mathsf{ZF}$ that ${\\mathbb R}$ is a countable union of countable sets. From this, it follows easily that $\\omega_1$ also has this property. A proof can be found in Jech's book on the Axiom of Choice. The problem is that, as you suspect, \"The supremum of a countable set of countable ordinals\" cannot be proved without some choice to be countable. The issue is that although we know that each countable ordinal is in bijection with $\\omega$, there is no uniform way of picking for each countable ordinal one such bijection. Now, you need this to run the usual proof that a countable union of countable sets is countable. In fact, things can be worse: Gitik showed that it is consistent with $\\mathsf{ZF}$ that every infinite (well-ordered) cardinal has cofinality $\\omega$. (\"All uncountable cardinals can be singular\", Israel J. Math, 35, (1980) 61-88.) On the other hand, one can check that a countable union of countable sets of ordinals must have size at most $\\omega_1$ (which is essentially what your HW is asking to verify). So, in Gitik's model, $\\omega_2$ is a countable union of countable unions of countable ordinals, but not a countable union of countable ordinals. Let me add two comments about other things you say in your question: You write \"I have read that it is provable in $\\mathsf{ZF}$ that there are no cardinals $\\kappa$ such that $\\aleph_0<\\kappa<\\aleph_1$\". This is true, but it is stronger than that: By definition $\\aleph_1$ is the first ordinal that is not countable, so of course there are no cardinals in between $\\aleph_0$ and $\\aleph_1$. Similarly, there are no cardinals between any (well-ordered) cardinal $\\kappa$ and its successor $\\kappa^+$, by definition . It is true, however, that a countable union of countable sets need not be comparable with $\\aleph_1$ without choice. In fact, we can have a non-well-orderable set that can be written as a countable union of sets of size 2. Edit, Jun 24/16: To see that a countable union of countable sets of ordinals cannot equal $\\omega_2$, we check more generally that if $\\kappa$ is a (well-ordered) cardinal, then a union of $\\kappa$ many sets, each of size at most $\\kappa$, cannot have size $\\kappa^{++}$: Let $S_0,S_1,\\dots,S_\\beta,\\dots$, $\\beta<\\kappa$, be sets of ordinals, each of size at most $\\kappa$. Let $S$ be their union and let $\\alpha={\\rm ot}(S)$, the order type of $S$. Similarly, let $o_\\iota={\\rm ot}(S_\\iota)$ for each $\\iota<\\kappa$. Each $o_\\iota$ is an ordinal below $\\kappa^+$ and therefore $o=\\sup_\\iota o_\\iota\\le\\kappa^+$. Use this to define a surjection $f$ from $\\kappa\\times o$ onto $\\alpha$, from which it follows that there is an injection from $\\alpha$ into $\\kappa\\times o$, and therefore a injection from $\\alpha$ into $\\kappa^+$: Given $(\\iota,\\beta)\\in \\kappa\\times o$, define $f(\\iota,\\beta)=0$ unless $\\beta<o_\\iota$ and, letting $\\gamma$ be the $\\beta$-th element in the increasing enumeration of $S_\\iota$, we have that $\\iota$ is least such that $\\gamma\\in S_\\iota$. If this is the case, then set $f(\\iota,\\beta)=\\delta$, where $\\delta$ is defined so that $\\gamma$ is the $\\delta$-th member of $S$ in its increasing enumeration. It should be clear that $f$ is a surjection, and we are done. (It is perhaps clear, but let me remark that if $\\omega_1$ can be written as the countable union of countable sets, then any $\\alpha<\\omega_2$ can be written this way as well, so $\\omega_2$ cannot be replaced with any smaller bound.)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's start by looking at the user's question on Math Stack Exchange. The user is dealing with a problem in Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (ZF) without the Axiom of Choice (AC). The original homework question was to prove that a countable union of countable sets doesn't have cardinality ℵ₂. The user's solution claims it doesn't have cardinality ℵₙ for any non-zero ordinal n, but they're unsure if their approach is valid.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the problem and the user's concerns. The main points are:\n\n1. Proving in ZF that a countable union of countable sets doesn't have cardinality ℵ₂.\n2. The user extended this to argue it's not ℵₙ for any non-zero ordinal n.\n3. Their concern is about the step where the supremum of a countable set of countable ordinals is countable. They know that the countable union of countable sets isn't necessarily countable in ZF, but they're using an ordinal version where the supremum of countable ordinals should be countable. However, they're worried this might be similar to the problematic union case.\n\nThe user references that in ZF, there's no cardinal between ℵ₀ and ℵ₁ (by Hartogs' theorem), but they're concerned if the cardinality of the union could be incomparable to ℵ₁, which would mean it's not a well-ordered cardinal. However, their conclusion is that the union can't be ℵₙ for n ≥ 2. They also mention possibly weakening their claim to the supremum being at most ω₁, which would still give the desired result for n ≥ 2.\n\nNow, the task is to structure this problem into the specified format: listing assumptions and the problem statement. The example given was about divisibility by 91, so here we need to extract assumptions from the user's problem.\n\nAssumptions would include the context of working within ZF without AC, the properties of countable unions, ordinals, etc. Each assumption should be a single property applied to one object.\n\nLooking at the original problem: \"Prove that a countable union of countable sets does not have cardinality ℵ₂.\" The key assumptions here are the framework (ZF without AC), the countable union of countable sets, and the focus on cardinality ℵ₂. However, the user's solution involves more general ordinals, so their problem as posed includes the generalization to any non-zero ordinal n. But the core homework question is about ℵ₂.\n\nBut the user's formatted example included assumptions from the problem statement. So for this case, the assumptions need to be extracted from the problem the user is working on, which is proving that the cardinality isn't ℵ₂, but their approach involves more.\n\nWait, the user is asking about their own proof. But the task is to structure the problem as per the given format. Let me re-examine the example. The example took the original problem (prove A(n) is divisible by 91) and listed assumptions: n is integer, n divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the user in the example didn't state that n is divisible by 7. Wait, the example's original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption? That seems contradictory. Wait, maybe there was a mistake in the example. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal problem in the example: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\"\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems like a mistake because the original problem didn't require n to be divisible by 7. The original statement was for all integers n, so the assumption should just be n is an integer. However, the example adds \"n is divisible by 7\", which may be part of the problem's conditions. Wait, perhaps the example was incorrect? Or maybe the original problem had a typo. Alternatively, maybe the example was showing how to structure a problem that had that assumption. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in their example, but regardless, we need to follow the format as per instructions.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's original question is about proving in ZF that a countable union of countable sets doesn't have cardinality ℵ₂. The user's solution generalizes this to ℵₙ for any non-zero ordinal n, but they are concerned about the validity, particularly the step about the supremum of countable ordinals being countable.\n\nTo structure this as per the required format, the assumptions would be the ZF framework without AC, the countable union of countable sets, and perhaps the properties of ordinals involved. But the problem statement is to prove the cardinality isn't ℵ₂ (as per the homework question) or more generally ℵₙ as the user did.\n\nHowever, the user's problem as presented is their own question about the validity of their solution. But according to the instructions, we need to structure the problem presented in the Math Stack Exchange question into the format. The user's question is a bit meta—they are asking about their own proof's validity. But the task is to extract the mathematical problem they are working on, not their meta-question about their proof.\n\nWait, the example given was taking a problem statement and formatting it. So in this case, the original problem is the homework question: prove that a countable union of countable sets does not have cardinality ℵ₂. The user then discusses their approach and doubts. But the task is to structure the original problem (the homework question) into the format, not the user's extended problem. However, the user's question on MSE is about their solution to that problem, but perhaps the formatted problem should be the homework question they were trying to solve.\n\nAlternatively, the user's own problem is whether their generalization is correct. But according to the instructions, the task is to read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange (which in this case is the user's own question about their proof) and structure that problem into the format. Wait, the example given was taking an original problem and structuring it. The user here is presenting their own MSE question, which is about the validity of their solution to the homework problem. However, the task is to extract the mathematical problem they are working on, i.e., the homework problem they were trying to solve, and structure that.\n\nBut let me re-read the instructions: \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\"\n\nSo the input is the user's MSE question, and we need to extract the core mathematical problem from it, filtering out the other details (like their doubts about their solution, references to ordinals, etc.). The original homework problem is to prove that a countable union of countable sets does not have cardinality ℵ₂ in ZF. The rest of the user's question is about their solution's validity, which is their meta-question, but the core problem is the homework question.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption: The framework is ZF without the Axiom of Choice,\nEach set in the union is countable,\nThe union is a countable union of such sets.\nProblem: Prove that the cardinality of the union is not ℵ₂.\n\nBut wait, the user also mentions their solution involves showing it's not ℵₙ for any non-zero ordinal n, but the original problem is just about ℵ₂. However, the user's MSE question is about whether their generalization is valid. So maybe the problem to structure is their generalized version? The user is asking whether their approach to proving it's not ℵₙ is correct, but the original homework was about ℵ₂.\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. The example given in the instructions took the original problem (prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91) and added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect because the original problem's assumption was for every integer n, not just those divisible by 7. But perhaps the example was illustrative, not literal. Alternatively, maybe there was a typo or mistake.\n\nGiven that, perhaps in the current case, the assumptions should include that we are working in ZF without AC, the union is a countable union of countable sets, and the problem is to prove the cardinality is not ℵ₂. However, the user's own problem extends this to ℵₙ, so perhaps that's part of the problem statement.\n\nBut the user's MSE question is titled \"The cardinality of a countable union of countable sets, without the axiom of choice\" and the question is about proving in ZF that the union doesn't have cardinality ℵ₂, with their solution generalizing it. So the core problem is the original homework question, and the user's doubts are about their solution to it.\n\nTherefore, structuring the core problem:\n\nAssumption: The axioms of ZF are used (without the Axiom of Choice),\nEach set in the countable union is countable,\nThe union is a countable collection of these sets.\nProblem: Prove that the cardinality of the union is not ℵ₂.\n\nAlternatively, if considering the user's generalized version, the problem would be to prove it's not ℵₙ for any non-zero ordinal n. But the original homework was specifically about ℵ₂.\n\nThe user is unsure about their generalization, but the task is to structure the problem they were working on. Since the homework was about ℵ₂, that's the main problem. However, the user's own problem in their MSE question includes their generalization, so perhaps that should be included.\n\nBut the example in the instructions shows that sometimes assumptions are added that weren't explicitly in the original problem. For instance, the example added \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". That seems conflicting. Perhaps the example was a mistake, but we have to follow the format.\n\nIn this case, the original problem (homework) is to prove in ZF that a countable union of countable sets does not have cardinality ℵ₂. The user's solution claims it's not ℵₙ, but they are unsure. However, the problem to structure is the original homework question, not the user's extension. Thus, the assumptions are:\n\n- Working in ZF without AC.\n- The union is a countable union of countable sets.\n\nProblem: Prove that the cardinality of this union is not ℵ₂.\n\nHowever, the user's MSE question includes their doubts about their own generalization. But according to the instructions, we need to filter unrelated information and structure the problem. The unrelated information includes their doubts about the proof, references to ordinals, etc. So the core problem is the homework question.\n\nAlternatively, if the user's question is considered as the problem (i.e., whether their generalization is correct), then the problem would be different. But the instructions say \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" The mathematics question here is the user's own question about their proof, but the underlying mathematical problem they're addressing is the original homework question. Therefore, the formatted problem should be the homework question.\n\nHence:\n\nAssumption: The axioms of ZF are used (without the Axiom of Choice),\nEach set in the union is countable,\nThe union is a countable collection of countable sets.\nProblem: Prove that the cardinality of the union is not ℵ₂.\n\nBut the user's problem in their MSE question also touches on the generalization to ℵₙ. However, since the task is to structure the problem as per the example, which focused on the original problem, not the user's extension, I think the formatted problem should be about ℵ₂. However, the user's title mentions the general case, and their question is about whether their solution showing it's not ℵₙ is valid. Therefore, perhaps the problem they are asking about is their generalized version.\n\nIn that case, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: The axioms of ZF are used (without the Axiom of Choice),\nEach set in the union is countable,\nThe union is a countable collection of countable sets,\nFor any ordinal n, ℵₙ is the nth aleph number.\nProblem: Prove that the cardinality of the union is not ℵₙ for any non-zero ordinal n.\n\nBut maybe the assumptions should be more precise. Alternatively, considering the user's specific doubt about the supremum of countable ordinals, but that's part of their solution, not the problem's assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is about cardinality in ZF, the assumptions are:\n\n- ZF axioms without AC,\n- Countable union of countable sets.\n\nProblem: Prove that the union's cardinality is not ℵ₂ (original homework) or not ℵₙ for any non-zero ordinal n (user's generalization).\n\nGiven the user's title mentions ℵ₂, but their question body discusses ℵₙ, it's a bit ambiguous. The title says \"does not have cardinality ℵ₂\", but the user's solution extends it. The problem they want to structure is likely the original homework question, so ℵ₂.\n\nHowever, the user's main concern is about their generalization, so perhaps the problem to structure is their version. But the example in the instructions took the original problem and structured it, even if the user had extra thoughts. So maybe we should take the original homework question as presented in the title: \"Prove that a countable union of countable sets does not have cardinality ℵ₂\".\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: The framework is ZF set theory without the Axiom of Choice,\nEach set in the union is countable,\nThe union consists of countably many such sets.\nProblem: Prove that the cardinality of the union is not ℵ₂.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions included specific conditions on n (integer and divisible by 7). Here, the assumptions are more about the context (ZF without AC) and the structure of the union.\n\nAnother consideration: In ZF without AC, a countable union of countable sets might not be countable, but it's still possible to bound its cardinality. The problem is to show it can't be exactly ℵ₂.\n\nI think this is the correct approach. Thus, the final formatted problem should reflect the original homework question, with assumptions about ZF, countable union, countable sets, and the problem to prove the cardinality isn't ℵ₂.",
