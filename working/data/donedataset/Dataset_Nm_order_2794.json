    "Content": "If $G$ is cyclic, then $G/H$ is cyclic? The proof I got goes like this: $G$ is cyclic, so $G=<g>$ for some $g\\in G$. So any coset in $G/H$ would be of the form $Hg'=Hg^n$ for some $n$. So $Hg$ is an generator of $G/H$. Thus, $G/H$ is cyclic. I might just be confusing myself, but we have only shown that $Hg'$ is in form of $(Hg)^n$. But what if we are missing some $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$? That is, there is no quotient group of the form $Hg^2$, for example. To make myself a little bit clearer, I think what the above proof has done was showing that $\\forall Hg'\\in G/H, Hg'\\in <Hg>$, thus $G/H \\subset <Hg>$. I feel that this is not a complete proof.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "As other answers have noted, the quotient group is a group .  Because $G$ is cyclic, every element of $G$ can be written in the form $g^n$ for some $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ .  Thus, all the right cosets will be of the form $Hg^n$ for some $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ , and you can arrive at $Hg^n$ by \"multiplying\" (as it's been defined) $Hg$ by itself $n$ times.  Also, if $G/H$ is smaller than $G$ ⁠—which happens whenever ⁠ $H$ is a nontrivial normal subgroup—then there will indeed be some $n$ missing, in a sense $^\\dagger$ : we will have $Hg^n = Hg^m$ for some $n \\neq m$ .  But this will be of no consequence to the above proof. Here is a different way of approaching this problem, sans cosets $^\\ddagger$ : If $H$ is a subgroup of a cyclic group $G$ , then $H$ is necessarily normal since every subgroup of an abelian group is normal (cyclic implies abelian).  As such*, there exists a group $G_1$ and a surjective group homomorphism $\\phi:G \\rightarrow G_1$ such that $\\ker(\\phi) = H$ .  From the isomorphism theorem , we get $G_1 \\cong G/H$ . So the problem is equivalent to determining whether the homomorphic image of a cyclic group is cyclic.  This is rather immediate: assuming $g$ generates $G$ , consider any $a \\in G_1$ .  We have $a = \\phi(g^n)$ for some $n$ , and further $\\phi(g^n) = \\phi(g)^n$ .  So we see that $\\phi(g)$ generates $G_1$ . $$\\underline{\\textbf{Footnotes}} \\\\[0.5em]$$ $^\\dagger$ This is to say: as we pass to the quotient, some elements are now regarded as \"the same\" modulo $H$ .  For more about this, see my post here for analogous discussion pertaining to rings and their quotients; for groups of course, there is only $1$ operation / operation table. $^\\ddagger$ To be perfectly accurate, it's not that we aren't using cosets; rather, we are sweeping them under the rug of the isomorphism theorem. *Indeed, in general, $G/H$ is a group $\\iff H$ is normal.  There are many equivalent notions for normality.  Click here for further discussion.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question.\n\nFirst, I need to read the original problem carefully. The question is: \"If G is cyclic then G/H is cyclic?\" The user provided an example where assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. \n\nLooking at the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Then the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. So, in this case, I need to extract the assumptions from the problem on cyclic groups.\n\nThe problem here is about group theory. The main statement is that if G is cyclic, then the quotient group G/H is cyclic. The user is questioning the proof provided, which argues that since G is cyclic (generated by some g), any coset in G/H can be written as Hg^n, so Hg generates G/H. But the user is concerned that the proof might be incomplete because maybe not all n are covered, like Hg^2, etc. They think the proof only shows that every element of G/H is in the subgroup generated by Hg, but maybe the subgroup is the whole group?\n\nBut for formatting, the assumptions need to be listed. The original problem states that G is cyclic. The quotient group G/H is considered. So the assumptions here are that G is a cyclic group and H is a subgroup of G. Wait, in the original problem, H is a subgroup, right? Because G/H is a quotient group, which requires H to be a normal subgroup. But in general, if G is abelian (which cyclic groups are), all subgroups are normal, so H is a subgroup. So the assumptions are:\n\n1. G is a cyclic group.\n2. H is a subgroup of G.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user is asking whether G/H is cyclic. So the problem is to prove that if G is cyclic and H is a subgroup, then G/H is cyclic.\n\nBut in the example provided, the assumptions were split into separate lines, each with one condition on one object. So here, \"G is cyclic\" is one assumption. Then \"H is a subgroup of G\" is another assumption. Wait, the problem is \"If G is cyclic then G/H is cyclic?\" So perhaps the only assumption is that G is cyclic, and H is a subgroup. But since quotient groups require H to be normal, but in cyclic groups, all subgroups are normal, so maybe the assumption is just that H is a subgroup. Wait, but the problem as posed is just \"If G is cyclic, then G/H is cyclic?\" So the user might have H as a subgroup, not necessarily normal. But in the problem statement, they mention \"quotient group G/H\", which implies H is normal. However, in abelian groups, all subgroups are normal, so maybe that's implicit. \n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- G is a cyclic group.\n- H is a subgroup of G.\n\nBecause H must be a subgroup (and hence normal in G since G is abelian) to form the quotient group G/H. Then the problem is to prove that G/H is cyclic.\n\nBut wait, the original question didn't specify that H is a subgroup; it just said G/H. So maybe the user assumes H is a subgroup. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption: G is a cyclic group,\n\nAssumption: H is a subgroup of G.\n\nProblem: Prove that G/H is cyclic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is as stated, but the user is confused about the proof. However, for formatting, we just need to extract the assumptions and the problem. The problem is to determine if G/H is cyclic when G is cyclic. The proof provided is considered possibly incomplete by the user.\n\nBut according to the example, the user structured the problem by extracting the assumptions from the original problem. So in the original problem here, the main assumption is that G is cyclic, and H is a subgroup (as G/H is a group). So the formatted problem would have those two assumptions. But in the example, the assumptions were split into each line, each for one object. So here, two assumptions: G is cyclic and H is a subgroup.\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So each assumption is a separate line, each applying to one object. So in this case, the first assumption is G is cyclic. The second assumption is H is a subgroup of G. Then the problem is to prove G/H is cyclic.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because H must be a subgroup for G/H to be defined as a group. Therefore, the formatted problem should have those two assumptions and the problem statement.",
