    "Content": "Let $M$ be a non-empty and finite set, $S_1,...,S_k$ subsets\nof $M$ , satisfying: $|S_i|\\leq 3,i=1,2,...,k$ Any element of $M$ is an element of at least $4$ sets among $S_1,....,S_k$ . Show that one can select $[\\frac{3k}{7}] $ sets from $S_1,...,S_k$ such that their union is $M$ . Partial solution: I can find a family of ${13\\over 25}k$ such sets that no element in $M$ is in more then 3 set from that family. Thus we have a family of the size ${13\\over 25}k$ instead of ${4\\over 7}k$ . Say $|M| =n$ . Let' s take any set independently with a probability $p$ . Let's mark with $X$ a number of a chosen sets and with $Y$ a number of elements that are ''bad''\ni.e. elements which are in at least 4 sets among a chosen sets. Note that $4n\\leq 3k$ . Then we have $$E(X-Y)=E(X)-E(Y) \\geq  kp-np^4 \\geq kp (1-3p^3/4)$$ Since a function $x \\mapsto  x(1-3x^3/4)$ achives a maximum at $x=\\sqrt[3]{1/3}$ we have $E(X-Y)\\geq {\\sqrt[3]{9}\\over 4}k> {13\\over 25}k$ . So with the method of alteration we find constant ${\\sqrt[3]{9}\\over 4}$ which is about $0,051$ worse then ${4\\over 7}$ . The question is cross-posted to mathoverflow",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "We give the bound $\\frac{59}{140}k<\\frac{3}{7}k$ by using a randomized algorithm introduced in the book ‘Probabilistic Method’ (Section 3.5) by Alon and Spencer. Let $H=(M,\\mathcal S)$ be a hypergraph, where $\\{S_1,...,S_k\\}=\\mathcal S$ . Assume each vertex\nappears in exactly $4$ hyperedges. For each $S\\in \\mathcal S$ , let $x_S$ be a uniform random label in the interval $[0,1]$ , where all choices are independent. Note that with probability $1$ , all labels are distinct. The algorithm goes over the hyperedges in $\\mathcal S$ by an increasing order of their labels, coloring each hyperedge blue, unless it contains an vertex in $M$ which is not covered yet. When the algorithm end, the number (depends on all $x_v$ , $v\\in K$ ) of red hyperedges $X$ is an upper bound. Let's compute $\\mathbb E X$ . A hyperedge $S$ is colored blue if and only if it is not the first hyperedge containing any $m\\in S$ . An hyperedge $S'$ lies behind $S$ when its label $x_{S'}>x_S$ , which is of probability $1−x$ . So $$\\mathbb P(S \\text{ is blue})\\ge \\int_0^1 (1-(1-x)^3)^3dx=\\frac{81}{140}.$$ So $\\mathbb EX\\le \\frac{59}{140}k$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. So, the user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The original question is about domination with sets. Let me read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem states: Let M be a non-empty and finite set. There are subsets S₁, S₂, ..., S_k of M. The conditions are that each S_i has size at most 3 (|S_i| ≤ 3 for all i from 1 to k). Also, every element of M is in at least 4 of these sets. The goal is to show that we can select ⌊3k/7⌋ sets from these such that their union is M.\n\nThe user also mentions a partial solution where they found a family of 13/25 k sets, but they need to reach 3/7 k. Then there's some probabilistic method discussion, but maybe that's part of their attempt, not the problem statement.\n\nSo, to structure this into the Assumption and Problem sections. The assumptions should list each condition. Let me break down the problem:\n\n1. M is a non-empty finite set. So that's one assumption.\n2. Each subset S₁, ..., S_k has |S_i| ≤ 3. That's another condition applied to each S_i.\n3. Every element of M is in at least 4 of the sets S₁ to S_k. That's a third condition on the elements of M.\n\nThen the problem is to select ⌊3k/7⌋ sets such that their union is M.\n\nWait, the problem says \"show that one can select [3k/7] sets...\" where [ ] probably denotes the floor function. The example given in the user's prompt used LaTeX \\left\\lfloor and \\right\\rfloor but here it's written as [\\frac{3k}{7}]. Hmm, the original problem uses square brackets, which sometimes denote the floor function, but depending on context. However, in the example provided by the user earlier, the problem used \\lfloor and \\rfloor. But in this case, the original problem as presented by the user writes \"[\\frac{3k}{7}]\", so maybe the user is using square brackets to denote floor. I should check the original problem's context. Wait, the original question is cross-posted to MathOverflow, but here it's written as \"Partial solution:...\". The key is that the problem statement requires selecting floor(3k/7) sets.\n\nSo, the assumptions would be:\n\n- M is a non-empty finite set.\n- Each S_i (for i = 1, 2, ..., k) is a subset of M with |S_i| ≤ 3.\n- Each element of M is contained in at least 4 of the sets S₁, ..., S_k.\n\nProblem: Show that one can select ⌊3k/7⌋ sets from S₁, ..., S_k such that their union is M.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement as given by the user, the original problem says \"show that one can select [\\frac{3k}{7}] sets...\". The square brackets here might be intended as the floor function. In LaTeX, floor is usually denoted with \\lfloor and \\rfloor, but sometimes people use square brackets. So, to be precise, the problem is to select the floor of 3k/7 sets. So in the Problem section, it should be written with floor notation.\n\nBut in the example provided by the user, when the problem involved divisibility by 91, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, the example's formatted problem included \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, but in the original problem, the user might have made a mistake. Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the example was a mistake? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption shouldn't restrict n to being divisible by 7. But maybe the example was a different problem? Wait, the user provided an example where they restructured a problem. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, this seems incorrect. The original problem states \"for every integer n\", so n is any integer. The formatted problem's assumption adds that n is divisible by 7, which would restrict the problem. That's probably a mistake. But maybe the example is incorrect. However, the user's instruction is to follow the format, so even if the example is wrong, I need to follow the structure. However, in the current problem, the user's original question does have specific conditions, so I need to list all assumptions correctly.\n\nSo, for the current problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n1. M is a non-empty set.\n2. M is finite.\n3. Each subset S_i (for i = 1, 2, ..., k) is a subset of M.\n4. For each i, |S_i| ≤ 3.\n5. Each element of M is an element of at least 4 sets among S₁, ..., S_k.\n\nProblem: Show that one can select ⌊3k/7⌋ sets from S₁, ..., S_k such that their union is M.\n\nWait, but the user wrote \"satisfying: |S_i| ≤ 3, i=1,2,...,k. Any element of M is an element of at least 4 sets among S_1,....,S_k.\" So those are the conditions. Each S_i has size at most 3, and each element is in at least 4 sets. So each of these should be separate assumptions.\n\nSo, in the Assumption section:\n\nEach S_i (i from 1 to k) is a subset of M with |S_i| ≤ 3.\n\nEach element of M is contained in at least 4 of the sets S₁, ..., S_k.\n\nAlso, M is non-empty and finite.\n\nSo each of these as separate lines. So:\n\nAssumption:\nM is a non-empty set,\nM is a finite set,\nFor each i in {1, 2, ..., k}, S_i is a subset of M,\nFor each i in {1, 2, ..., k}, |S_i| ≤ 3,\nEvery element of M is contained in at least 4 sets among S₁, ..., S_k.\n\nProblem: Show that there exists a selection of ⌊3k/7⌋ sets from S₁, ..., S_k whose union is M.\n\nI think that's correct. The key is to separate each assumption into individual conditions. The first two points about M being non-empty and finite are separate. Then each S_i is a subset, each S_i has size ≤3, and each element is in at least 4 sets.\n\nThe problem is to select floor(3k/7) sets covering M.\n\nI need to make sure that the problem statement in the formatted version captures exactly what's required. The original problem says \"select [3k/7] sets from S₁,...,S_k such that their union is M.\" Since [3k/7] likely denotes the floor function, it's better to use LaTeX's \\lfloor and \\rfloor. However, the user's example used square brackets in LaTeX (written as [\\frac{3k}{7}]), which would render as [3k/7]. But in the problem statement, the user wrote \"[\\frac{3k}{7}]\", so perhaps they mean the floor function. To be precise, in the Problem section, I should use \\lfloor and \\rfloor. However, the user's example in the original problem (the divisibility by 91) didn't use LaTeX's floor notation, but used regular brackets. But given that this is a different problem, I should follow what's written. However, in the problem statement here, the user wrote \"show that one can select $[\\frac{3k}{7}]$ sets from...\", so in LaTeX, they have square brackets around 3k/7. Depending on the context, in mathematics, square brackets can sometimes denote the floor function, but it's ambiguous. However, given that the partial solution mentions 13/25k vs 4/7k, which are fractions without flooring, but the problem requires selecting an integer number of sets. Therefore, the problem is asking for the floor of 3k/7 sets. Hence, using \\lfloor and \\rfloor would be appropriate. However, since the user wrote \"[\\frac{3k}{7}]\", maybe they intended LaTeX's \\left\\lfloor \\frac{3k}{7} \\right\\rfloor, but used square brackets. Alternatively, maybe they just used square brackets as notation. To be safe, I can write it as \\lfloor \\frac{3k}{7} \\rfloor, which is standard. But since the user's example used square brackets, perhaps they just want it as [3k/7], but I need to check. Wait, in the user's example, the problem was written as \"Prove that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$ is divisible by 91.\" So they used LaTeX with proper formatting. Therefore, in this problem, the user wrote \"[\\frac{3k}{7}]\" in LaTeX. So in LaTeX, square brackets are just square brackets, not floor function. But in the problem statement, selecting a number of sets must be an integer. Therefore, it's more likely that the problem requires the floor of 3k/7, which is the greatest integer less than or equal to 3k/7. Therefore, the correct notation would be \\lfloor 3k/7 \\rfloor. However, the user wrote [\\frac{3k}{7}], which is ambiguous. But given that in mathematical literature, square brackets are sometimes used for floor, but more commonly, floor is denoted with the floor symbols. Therefore, to resolve this ambiguity, perhaps the problem as originally stated on Math Stack Exchange uses the floor function, and the user here transcribed it with square brackets. Hence, in the formatted problem, it's better to use the floor notation. So I'll write \\lfloor \\frac{3k}{7} \\rfloor.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nProblem: Show that one can select $\\lfloor \\frac{3k}{7} \\rfloor$ sets from $S_1, \\dotsc, S_k$ such that their union is $M$.\n\nBut in the user's example, they wrote \"problem: Prove that $$A(n) = ...$$ is divisible by 91.\" So in the problem section, the mathematical expression is enclosed in $$...$$. Therefore, here, the problem would be written as:\n\nProblem: Show that one can select $$\\left\\lfloor \\frac{3k}{7} \\right\\rfloor$$ sets from $S_1, \\dotsc, S_k$ such that their union is $M$.\n\nBut perhaps in LaTeX, using \\lfloor and \\rfloor without the left and right commands would be sufficient. Alternatively, using \\lfloor \\frac{3k}{7} \\rfloor. Let me check the original problem's wording. The user wrote \"Partial solution: I can find a family of ${13\\over 25}k$ such sets...\", so they used LaTeX's fraction. Then \"the problem is cross-posted...\". But in the problem statement, it's \"show that one can select $[\\frac{3k}{7}]$ sets...\", which in LaTeX would just be square brackets around the fraction. However, given that you can't have a fraction of a set, the problem must mean the floor function, so perhaps the original problem used square brackets to denote floor. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had floor notation, and the user here mistakenly wrote square brackets. But regardless, in the formatted problem, to avoid ambiguity, using the floor notation would be clearer. So I think it's safe to use \\lfloor and \\rfloor.\n\nThus, putting it all together, the assumptions and problem should be structured as:\n\nAssumption:\n$M$ is a non-empty set,\n$M$ is a finite set,\nFor each $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, k\\}$, $S_i$ is a subset of $M$,\nFor each $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, k\\}$, $|S_i| \\leq 3$,\nEvery element of $M$ is contained in at least $4$ sets among $S_1, \\ldots, S_k$.\n\nProblem:\nShow that one can select $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{3k}{7} \\right\\rfloor$ sets from $S_1, \\ldots, S_k$ such that their union is $M$.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user wrote \"Any element of M is an element of at least 4 sets among S_1,....,S_k\". So that's an assumption on every element of M. So the fifth assumption is that each element is in at least 4 of the S_i's.\n\nYes, this seems correct. Each assumption is a single condition applied to one object. The first two are about M: non-empty and finite. Then each S_i is a subset of M, each S_i has size ≤3, and each element of M is in at least 4 sets.\n\nSo this should be the properly formatted problem.",
