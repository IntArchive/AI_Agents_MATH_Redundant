By the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, those automorphisms should be a subgroup of the ones that fix $\\mathbb{Q}$.

However, I am getting too many automorphisms.  One automorphism that fixes $i\\sqrt{2}$ is $\\sigma: \\sqrt[8]{2} \\mapsto \\zeta\\sqrt[8]{2}, i \\mapsto -i$.  However, this means all powers of $\\sigma$ fix $i\\sqrt{2}$, and I know $Q_8$ does not contain a cyclic subgroup of order $8$.  What am I doing wrong? (Please do not give me the answer.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to help structure this problem from the Math Stack Exchange question. The user is trying to prove that the Galois group of the extension Q(⁸√2, i) over Q(√-2) is isomorphic to the quaternion group Q8. But they're running into a contradiction because they're getting too many automorphisms. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's identify all the assumptions. The problem involves field extensions and Galois groups. The main objects here are the fields Q(⁸√2, i) and Q(√-2). The user mentions automorphisms that fix Q(√-2), which is the base field here. The key points from the question are:\n\n1. The user is working with the field extension Q(⁸√2, i)/Q(√-2).\n2. They tried listing all automorphisms of Q(⁸√2, i) that fix Q, then picking those that fix i√2 (since Q(√-2) is Q(i√2)).\n3. They previously found that the automorphisms fixing Q are given by σ: ⁸√2 ↦ ζ^n ⁸√2 and i ↦ ±i, where ζ = e^(2πi/8) and n from 0 to 7.\n4. They note that an automorphism σ: ⁸√2 ↦ ζ⁸√2, i ↦ -i fixes i√2, and its powers would also fix i√2, leading to a cyclic subgroup of order 8, which contradicts Q8 not having such a subgroup.\n\nNow, the assumptions need to be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. Let's parse this:\n\n- The field extension in question is Q(⁸√2, i)/Q(√-2). So the base field is Q(√-2), and the top field is Q(⁸√2, i).\n- The Galois group Gal(Q(⁸√2, i)/Q(√-2)) is in question.\n- The user is using automorphisms that fix Q(√-2). So each automorphism must fix the base field Q(√-2).\n- The automorphisms of Q(⁸√2, i) fixing Q are determined by their action on generators ⁸√2 and i. Specifically, ⁸√2 can be mapped to ζ^n ⁸√2 (n=0,...,7) and i can be mapped to ±i.\n- The element i√2 is in Q(√-2) since √-2 = i√2. So automorphisms fixing Q(√-2) must fix i√2.\n- The user constructed an automorphism σ which maps ⁸√2 to ζ⁸√2 and i to -i. They claim that σ fixes i√2. Let's check: σ(i√2) = σ(i)σ(√2) = (-i)σ(2^(1/2)). Wait, √2 is (⁸√2)^4, so σ(√2) = σ(⁸√2)^4 = (ζ⁸√2)^4 = ζ^4 * √2. Since ζ = e^(2πi/8) = e^(πi/4), ζ^4 = e^(πi) = -1. So σ(√2) = -√2. Therefore, σ(i√2) = (-i)(-√2) = i√2. So yes, σ fixes i√2.\n- The problem arises when considering the powers of σ. If σ has order 8, then the subgroup generated by σ would be cyclic of order 8, but Q8 doesn't have such a subgroup. So the user thinks they made a mistake here.\n\nPossible issues: Maybe the order of σ isn't actually 8? Let's check. σ^2 would map ⁸√2 to σ(ζ⁸√2) = ζ σ(⁸√2) = ζ*(ζ⁸√2) = ζ^2 ⁸√2, and i to σ(-i) = -σ(i) = -(-i) = i. So σ^2: ⁸√2 ↦ ζ^2 ⁸√2, i ↦ i. Similarly, σ^4 would map ⁸√2 to ζ^4 ⁸√2 = -⁸√2, and i stays i. Then σ^8 would map ⁸√2 to ζ^8 ⁸√2 = ⁸√2 (since ζ^8=1) and i to (-1)^8 i = i. So σ^8 is the identity. But does σ have order 8? Wait, when n=8, σ^8 is identity. But maybe there's a smaller order? Let's see: σ^4: ⁸√2 ↦ -⁸√2, i ↦ i. Then σ^4 is not identity, since ⁸√2 is mapped to -⁸√2. Then σ^8 is identity. So σ does have order 8. But Q8 has elements of order 4, so this would suggest the Galois group has an element of order 8, which Q8 doesn't have. Hence the contradiction.\n\nBut the user is supposed to have Galois group Q8. Therefore, the mistake must be in assuming that σ is in the Galois group. Wait, but they checked that σ fixes i√2. So perhaps σ is indeed in the Galois group, but then the Galois group can't be Q8. So where's the error?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the extension Q(⁸√2, i)/Q(√-2) is not Galois? But if it's a Galois extension, then the group would be correct. Or maybe the automorphisms fixing Q(√-2) have more constraints than just fixing i√2. Wait, but Q(√-2) = Q(i√2), so fixing Q(√-2) is equivalent to fixing i√2. But maybe there are more conditions. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal polynomial of ⁸√2 over Q(√-2) has degree less than 8, so the extension degree is less, leading to a smaller Galois group. But the user might have miscalculated the degree. Let's think: Q(⁸√2, i)/Q(√-2). Since Q(√-2) already contains i√2, which is i times √2. But does it contain i? No, because Q(√-2) is generated over Q by √-2 = i√2, which has degree 2 over Q, and doesn't contain i unless √2 is in it, which it isn't. So Q(√-2, i) would be a larger field. Wait, but the top field is Q(⁸√2, i). So the extension Q(⁸√2, i) over Q(√-2) is to compute.\n\nFirst, compute the degree. Let me see. Q(⁸√2, i) over Q: The minimal polynomial of ⁸√2 over Q is x^8 - 2, which is irreducible by Eisenstein. Then Q(⁸√2) has degree 8 over Q. Then adjoining i, which has degree 2, so total degree is 16 if they're linearly disjoint. But does Q(⁸√2) contain i? No, since Q(⁸√2) is real. So [Q(⁸√2, i) : Q] = 16.\n\nNow, Q(√-2) is Q(i√2), which is degree 2 over Q. So [Q(⁸√2, i) : Q(√-2)] = 16 / 2 = 8. So the Galois group should have order 8. Q8 is a group of order 8. But the user is getting a cyclic group of order 8, which contradicts.\n\nTherefore, the mistake must be in assuming that all automorphisms that fix Q and i√2 are given by σ as above. But perhaps some of those automorphisms do not actually fix Q(√-2). Wait, but Q(√-2) is generated by i√2, so if an automorphism fixes i√2, then it fixes the entire Q(√-2). So the user is correct that the automorphisms fixing Q(√-2) are those that fix i√2. So why is there a contradiction?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the element σ they constructed does not actually fix i√2? Wait, earlier calculation showed that σ(i√2) = i√2. So that part is correct. Then the subgroup generated by σ is cyclic of order 8, implying the Galois group is cyclic, which contradicts the desired Q8. Therefore, the error must be in the assumption that σ is an element of the Galois group. But why wouldn't σ be in the Galois group?\n\nWait, perhaps the extension Q(⁸√2, i)/Q(√-2) is not Galois? For it to be Galois, it must be normal and separable. Since we're in characteristic zero, it's separable. Is it normal? A normal extension is one where every irreducible polynomial over the base field that has a root in the extension splits. So, is Q(⁸√2, i) normal over Q(√-2)? The minimal polynomial of ⁸√2 over Q(√-2) would need to split in Q(⁸√2, i). Let's see. The minimal polynomial of ⁸√2 over Q(√-2) is x^8 - 2. Does this split in Q(⁸√2, i)? The roots are ζ8^k * ⁸√2 for k=0,...,7, where ζ8 is e^(2πi/8). Since i is in the field, and ζ8 = e^(πi/4) = (1+i)/√2, but √2 is in Q(⁸√2) (since (⁸√2)^4 = √2). So ζ8 is in Q(⁸√2, i), hence x^8 - 2 splits. Therefore, the extension is normal, hence Galois. So the Galois group should indeed have order 8.\n\nBut if there's an element of order 8, then the Galois group is cyclic, but the user wants it to be Q8. Therefore, the mistake must be in the user's approach. The user assumed that σ has order 8, but maybe it doesn't. Wait, earlier computation suggested σ^8 is identity, but what if there's a relation that makes the order lower? Wait, let's check σ^4. σ^4 sends ⁸√2 to ζ^4 ⁸√2 = -⁸√2, and i to i. So σ^4 is not identity. Then σ^8 sends ⁸√2 back to ⁸√2, and i to i. So σ does have order 8. Therefore, the Galois group contains a cyclic subgroup of order 8, hence is cyclic of order 8, contradicting Q8. So the user's mistake is perhaps in assuming the Galois group is Q8 when it's actually cyclic? Or maybe the problem statement is wrong?\n\nBut the user says they're supposed to prove it's Q8, so likely the error is in their approach. Maybe the automorphism σ they defined isn't actually in the Galois group? But why not? Because it fixes i√2. Alternatively, maybe there are more constraints. Let me think: The automorphism must fix Q(√-2). To fix Q(√-2), they must fix i√2. But also, they have to be field automorphisms. So when they defined σ as sending ⁸√2 to ζ⁸√2 and i to -i, does this actually define a valid automorphism?\n\nYes, because ζ is in the field Q(⁸√2, i) as we saw. So the automorphism is well-defined. So the problem is that if such an automorphism exists, the Galois group must have an element of order 8, hence be cyclic. But the user wants it to be Q8, which isn't cyclic. Hence, contradiction. Therefore, the user must have made a mistake in their initial assumptions.\n\nPossible resolution: Maybe the minimal polynomial of ⁸√2 over Q(√-2) has a lower degree? Let's check. The minimal polynomial of ⁸√2 over Q(√-2) would divide x^8 - 2. Let's see if x^8 - 2 factors over Q(√-2). Note that Q(√-2) contains √2, since √-2 = i√2, so √2 = -i√-2. But does it contain i? No, because Q(√-2) is a real field only if we adjoin i, but √-2 is imaginary. Wait, Q(√-2) is {a + b√-2 | a,b ∈ Q}, which is a subset of C. It contains i√2, but not i or √2 separately. So perhaps the minimal polynomial of ⁸√2 over Q(√-2) is still degree 8? If so, then the extension degree is 8, hence the Galois group has order 8. But if there's an element of order 8, then the group is cyclic. But the user wants Q8, which is non-abelian. So this suggests a contradiction, implying that the initial problem statement might be incorrect, or the user's approach is missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Galois group is Q8 only under certain conditions. For example, if the extension has elements of order 4 and the group is non-abelian. But how?\n\nWait, maybe the automorphism σ isn't order 8. Let's check again. σ sends ⁸√2 to ζ⁸√2 and i to -i. Then σ^2 sends ⁸√2 to ζ^2 ⁸√2 and i to i. σ^4 sends ⁸√2 to ζ^4 ⁸√2 = -⁸√2, i to i. Then σ^8 is identity. So yes, σ has order 8. But Q8 has no elements of order 8. Hence, if the Galois group has an element of order 8, it can't be Q8. Therefore, the user's mistake is in their approach of listing automorphisms; perhaps not all those automorphisms that fix Q(√-2) are captured correctly.\n\nWait, the user says they listed all automorphisms of Q(⁸√2, i) that fix Q, then picked those that fix i√2. But maybe some automorphisms that fix i√2 do not fix Q(√-2)? Wait, no. Fixing i√2 and Q implies fixing Q(√-2), since Q(√-2) = Q(i√2). So if an automorphism fixes Q and i√2, then it fixes Q(√-2). Therefore, the automorphisms fixing Q(√-2) are exactly those that fix Q and i√2. So the user's approach is correct in that.\n\nBut then the Galois group has order 8 and contains an element of order 8, hence is cyclic. So unless there's a mistake in the problem statement, the user's desired answer is wrong. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in their earlier proof that the automorphisms fixing Q are given by σ as described. Let's check that.\n\nThe field Q(⁸√2, i) over Q has degree 16, as we saw. The automorphism group should have order 16. The automorphisms are determined by mapping ⁸√2 to any root of x^8 - 2 and i to ±i. So there are 8 choices for ⁸√2 (the roots ζ8^k ⁸√2) and 2 choices for i, making 16 automorphisms, which matches the degree. So the user is correct that the automorphisms fixing Q are given by σ and τ where σ: ⁸√2 ↦ ζ⁸√2, i ↦ i and τ: ⁸√2 ↦ ⁸√2, i ↦ -i. Then the full Galois group over Q is generated by σ and τ, with relations σ^8=1, τ^2=1, and τστ = σ^−1 (since τσ(⁸√2) = τ(ζ⁸√2) = ζ^−1 ⁸√2 because τ(ζ) = τ(e^(πi/4)) = e^(−πi/4) = ζ^−1, since τ(i) = -i. So τσ = σ^{-1}τ. Hence, the Galois group over Q is the semidirect product of order 16, isomorphic to the dihedral group D8.\n\nBut the user is looking at the subgroup fixing Q(√-2). Since Q(√-2) is fixed, the automorphisms must fix i√2. Let's see what that implies. Let's take an automorphism that fixes Q and i√2. So such an automorphism must satisfy σ(i√2) = i√2. Let's consider σ as before: σ(⁸√2) = ζ⁸√2 and σ(i) = -i. Then σ(i√2) = σ(i)σ(√2). Now, √2 is (⁸√2)^4, so σ(√2) = (σ(⁸√2))^4 = (ζ⁸√2)^4 = ζ^4 (⁸√2)^4 = ζ^4 √2. Since ζ^4 = e^(πi) = -1. So σ(√2) = -√2. Then σ(i√2) = (-i)(-√2) = i√2. So yes, fixes i√2. Similarly, consider τ: τ(i) = -i, τ(⁸√2) = ⁸√2. Then τ(i√2) = τ(i)τ(√2) = (-i)√2 = -i√2 ≠ i√2. So τ does NOT fix i√2. So τ is not in the Galois group Gal(Q(⁸√2, i)/Q(√-2)).\n\nBut what about other automorphisms? For example, σ^k: ⁸√2 ↦ ζ^k⁸√2, i ↦ (-1)^k i? Wait, no. The original automorphisms fixing Q are σ^n and σ^nτ, where σ^n: ⁸√2 ↦ ζ^n⁸√2, i ↦ i, and τ: i ↦ -i, ⁸√2 ↦ ⁸√2. So the automorphisms that fix Q(√-2) must fix i√2. Let's check for σ^n: σ^n(i√2) = σ^n(i) σ^n(√2) = i * (ζ^n⁸√2)^4 = i * ζ^{4n} (⁸√2)^4 = i * (-1)^n √2. For this to equal i√2, we need (-1)^n = 1, so n even. Therefore, σ^n with even n fix i√2. Also, for automorphisms σ^nτ: σ^nτ(i√2) = σ^n(τ(i√2)) = σ^n(-i√2) = -σ^n(i) σ^n(√2) = -i * ζ^{4n} √2 = -i * (-1)^n √2. For this to equal i√2, we need -i*(-1)^n √2 = i√2 ⇒ (-1)^{n+1} = 1 ⇒ n+1 even ⇒ n odd. So σ^nτ fixes i√2 when n is odd.\n\nWait, this is a different conclusion than the user had. The user thought that all powers of σ (which is σ^1) fix i√2, but in reality, only certain automorphisms fix i√2. Specifically, the automorphisms that fix i√2 are:\n\n- σ^n where n is even: since σ^n(i√2) = i*(-1)^{n} √2. So for even n, (-1)^n =1, so it fixes.\n\n- σ^nτ where n is odd: σ^nτ(i√2) = -i*(-1)^{n} √2. If n is odd, (-1)^n = -1, so -i*(-1)*√2 = i√2.\n\nTherefore, the automorphisms fixing Q(√-2) are:\n\n- σ^{2k} for k=0 to 3 (n=0,2,4,6)\n\n- σ^{2k+1}τ for k=0 to 3 (n=1,3,5,7)\n\nTotal of 8 automorphisms, which matches the order 8.\n\nNow, let's analyze the group structure. Let's denote the automorphisms as follows:\n\nLet’s define α = σ^2. Then α sends ⁸√2 to ζ^2 ⁸√2 and i to i. The order of α: α^4 = σ^8 = identity. So α has order 4.\n\nLet’s define β = σ τ. Then β sends ⁸√2 to σ(τ(⁸√2)) = σ(⁸√2) = ζ⁸√2, and β sends i to σ(τ(i)) = σ(-i) = -i. So β: ⁸√2 ↦ ζ⁸√2, i ↦ -i. Wait, but earlier we saw that β = σ τ. Let's compute β^2: β^2(⁸√2) = β(ζ⁸√2) = ζ β(⁸√2) = ζ * ζ⁸√2 = ζ^2 ⁸√2. β^2(i) = β(-i) = -β(i) = -(-i) = i. So β^2 = α.\n\nSimilarly, compute βαβ^{-1}: Let's compute βαβ^{-1}(⁸√2) = β(α(β^{-1}(⁸√2))). First, β^{-1} is the inverse of β. Since β sends ⁸√2 to ζ⁸√2, β^{-1} sends ⁸√2 to ζ^{-1}⁸√2. Then α acts as σ^2, so α(ζ^{-1}⁸√2) = ζ^{-1} σ^2(⁸√2) = ζ^{-1} ζ^2⁸√2 = ζ⁸√2. Then β acts on ζ⁸√2: β(ζ⁸√2) = ζ β(⁸√2) = ζ * ζ⁸√2 = ζ^2⁸√2. On the other hand, βαβ^{-1}(⁸√2) should be ζ^2⁸√2.\n\nAlternatively, since α = σ^2 and β = σ τ, compute βαβ^{-1} = σ τ σ^2 τ^{-1} σ^{-1} (since β^{-1} = τ^{-1} σ^{-1}). But this might get complicated. Alternatively, note that β α β^{-1} = β σ^2 β^{-1}. Let's compute β σ^2 β^{-1}(⁸√2): β σ^2 β^{-1}(⁸√2) = β σ^2 (ζ^{-1}⁸√2) = β(σ^2(ζ^{-1}⁸√2)) = β(ζ^{-1} σ^2(⁸√2)) = β(ζ^{-1} ζ^2⁸√2) = β(ζ⁸√2) = ζ β(⁸√2) = ζ * ζ⁸√2 = ζ^2⁸√2. On the other hand, α^{-1}(⁸√2) = σ^{-2}(⁸√2) = ζ^{-2}⁸√2. So βαβ^{-1} = α^{-1}. Thus, the group has relations α^4 = 1, β^2 = α^2, and βαβ^{-1} = α^{-1}. This is the presentation of the quaternion group Q8, where i = α, j = β, k = αβ, etc., with i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = -1, etc.\n\nThus, the Galois group is indeed Q8. So where was the user's mistake? The user considered the automorphism σ (which is our β) and noted that its powers would form a cyclic subgroup of order 8. However, in reality, β^2 = α, which has order 4, and α^2 = β^2 = σ^2 τ^2? Wait, no. Let's clarify.\n\nWait, β = σ τ. Then β^2 = σ τ σ τ. Let's compute β^2(⁸√2): σ τ σ τ(⁸√2) = σ τ σ(⁸√2) = σ τ(ζ⁸√2) = σ(ζ⁸√2) = ζ σ(⁸√2) = ζ * ζ⁸√2 = ζ^2⁸√2. Similarly, β^2(i) = σ τ σ τ(i) = σ τ σ(-i) = σ τ(-i) = σ(-i) = -i. Wait, that's not right. Wait, β^2(i) = β(β(i)) = β(-i) = -β(i) = -(-i) = i. Wait, no: β(i) = σ τ(i) = σ(-i) = -i. Then β^2(i) = β(-i) = σ τ(-i) = σ(-i) = -i. Wait, conflicting conclusions. Let me step back.\n\nβ = σ τ, so β(i) = σ(τ(i)) = σ(-i) = -i (since σ fixes i). Then β^2(i) = β(-i) = σ(τ(-i)) = σ(i) = i. Similarly, β^2(⁸√2) = β(β(⁸√2)) = β(ζ⁸√2) = σ(τ(ζ⁸√2)) = σ(ζ τ(⁸√2)) = σ(ζ⁸√2) = ζ σ(⁸√2) = ζ * ζ⁸√2 = ζ^2⁸√2. So β^2: ⁸√2 ↦ ζ^2⁸√2, i ↦ i. Which is σ^2. So β^2 = σ^2 = α. Therefore, β^4 = α^2 = σ^4. α^2 sends ⁸√2 to ζ^4⁸√2 = -⁸√2, i to i. Then β^4: ⁸√2 ↦ -⁸√2, i ↦ i. Then β^4 is not the identity, so β has order 8? Wait, β^4(⁸√2) = -⁸√2, and β^4(i) = i. Then β^8(⁸√2) = β^4(-⁸√2) = -β^4(⁸√2) = -(-⁸√2) = ⁸√2, and β^8(i) = i. So β has order 8. But earlier we saw that the group presentation gives Q8. Contradiction.\n\nWait, but according to the relations we had, βαβ^{-1} = α^{-1}, and β^2 = α. In Q8, the quaternions, we have elements i, j, k with i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = -1, and ij = k, jk = i, ki = j, etc. If we set α = i, β = j, then α^4 = 1, β^2 = α^2 = -1, and βαβ^{-1} = α^{-1}. But in our case, β^2 = α, which is σ^2. If α has order 4, then β^2 = α implies β has order 8, which would make the group cyclic, but we have the relation βα = α^{-1}β, which prevents it from being abelian. Wait, no: if βα = α^{-1}β, then the group is non-abelian. For example, in Q8, ij = k, ji = -k. So the group is non-abelian, but still has elements of order 4. However, in our case, β has order 8, which Q8 doesn't have. So there's a contradiction.\n\nThis suggests that either the group is not Q8, or there's a mistake in the calculation. However, the problem statement says to prove it's Q8. Therefore, the user must have made a mistake in their reasoning. The key point is that while β seems to have order 8, in reality, in the Galois group, β^4 is the automorphism sending ⁸√2 to -⁸√2 and i to i. But in the field Q(⁸√2, i), -⁸√2 is another root of x^8 - 2. However, the relation in the group might impose that β^4 = identity? No, because β^4 is not identity. Therefore, the group has an element of order 8, hence is cyclic, contradicting Q8. Therefore, the user's mistake is in their initial assumption that the Galois group is Q8, when in fact it's cyclic of order 8. But the problem says to prove it's Q8, so there must be a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user confused the Galois group of Q(⁸√2, i)/Q with that of Q(⁸√2, i)/Q(√-2). The former is D8 (order 16), the latter is Q8 (order 8). But according to our previous analysis, the latter has an element of order 8, hence cyclic. Unless there's a different structure.\n\nWait, another angle: the field Q(⁸√2, i) contains ζ8, which is a primitive 8th root of unity. The element ζ8 = e^(2πi/8) = (√2/2 + i√2/2). Since the field contains i and √2, ζ8 is indeed in the field. Therefore, the extension Q(⁸√2, i)/Q(√-2) is a Kummer extension? Because it's obtained by adjoining roots of unity and radicals. However, Kummer theory applies when the base field contains the roots of unity. Here, Q(√-2) does not contain ζ8, since ζ8 involves √2 and i, which are not both in Q(√-2). Therefore, Kummer theory might not directly apply.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Galois group is isomorphic to Q8 because the extension can be seen as a quaternion extension. But this requires specific conditions.\n\nPerhaps the confusion arises from different generators. Instead of ⁸√2 and i, maybe express the extension in terms of other elements. For example, let’s set α = ⁸√2 and β = i. Then Q(α, β) over Q(√-2) = Q(i√2). Let's see if we can find automorphisms that satisfy the quaternion relations.\n\nSuppose we define two automorphisms σ and τ such that σ^4 = 1, τ^2 = σ^2, and στ = τσ^3. These are the defining relations of Q8. Let's see if such automorphisms exist.\n\nLet’s try σ: α ↦ ζα, β ↦ β. But this would fix β=i, which doesn't help. Alternatively, let's take σ from before: σ: α ↦ ζα, β ↦ -β. Then, as before, σ has order 8. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, define σ: α ↦ ζα, β ↦ ζβ. Wait, but ζβ is not in the field unless β is multiplied by a root of unity in the field. But ζ = (1+i)/√2 is in the field, since we have i and √2. So ζβ = (1+i)/√2 * i = (i -1)/√2. But this might not preserve the field structure. Alternatively, perhaps define automorphisms that act non-trivially on both generators.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. The key issue is that the user's derived automorphism σ has order 8, implying a cyclic Galois group, which contradicts Q8. Therefore, the mistake lies in the user's assumption that such an automorphism σ is part of the Galois group. However, our earlier analysis shows that σ does fix i√2 and thus should be in the Galois group. Therefore, the conclusion is that the Galois group is cyclic of order 8, contradicting the problem's assertion. Hence, the user likely has an error in their problem statement or approach.\n\nBut since the problem asks to prove it's Q8, there must be a different perspective. Let's reconsider the extension Q(⁸√2, i)/Q(√-2). The field Q(√-2) contains i√2. Let's see if we can express the extension in terms of different generators. Let’s set γ = ⁸√2 * i. Then γ^8 = (⁸√2)^8 * i^8 = 2 * 1 = 2. So γ is a root of x^8 - 2 = 0. But this might not help. Alternatively, perhaps the minimal polynomial over Q(√-2) has a different structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Galois group is Q8 because the extension is a compositum of two quaternion extensions. But I need to stop here and structure the problem as per the required format.",
