    "Content": "I know, for example, the every isometry of $\\mathbb{R}^3$ can be written as a composition of at most $4$ reflections (through planes that doesn't necessarily have the 0 vector in them). I wish to prove to more general statement that says every isometry of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is of the form of a composition of at most $n+1$ reflections. The proof for the cases $n=2,3$ that I saw are a bit technical and I don't think that rotating and reflecting in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is a good way to show this (though possible and probably a lot more technical...) I need help with my tactic to prove this : I want to use induction, knowing this is true for $n=1$. The idea is this: if I were to define an isometry of the required form that acts the same on: the $0$ vector,$e_{1},...,e_{n}$ then I would be done. Now I want to use, somehow, the induction hypothesis, my thoughts are that the given isometry, $f$, takes $e_{1},...,e_{n}$ into $n$ points and from the induction hypothesis there is a composition of at most $n$ reflections that take the projection of $e_{1},...,e_{n}$ to $\\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ to the projection of $f(e_{1}),...,f(e_{n})$. From here I'm a bit lost, I want to say that this build also takes the zero vector of $\\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ to the projection of $f(0)$ to $\\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ and that I can compose what I got with one more reflection in a way that won't ruin what I already did and also help take care of the last coordinate. Any thoughts ? Edit: The proof in the link in the accepted answer it correct, but it seems that the proof given in the other answer is what I am trying to do, I would appriciate if someone could go into more details (I commented to the answer what I don't understand in it). Edit 2 : I tried writing the proof and complete all the details, did I do this correctly ? We will prove by induction that every isometry of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ can be represented\nas a composition of at most $n+1$reflections. Base case: We know that the claim is true for $n=1$(and $n=2$but\nI think that this will follow). Step: Let $V:=\\left\\{ x\\in\\mathbb{R}^n|x_{n}=0\\right\\} $and let $f\\in Iso(\\mathbb{R}^n)$. If $f(0)\\neq0$ then there exist $\\tau\\in O(n)$ s.t $\\tau\\circ f(0)=0$\n(explicitly: $\\tau$ is the reflection around the plane consistent\nof all point in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with equal distans from both $0$ and $f(0)$). We now assume $f(0)=0$ (otherwise we denote $g=\\tau\\circ f$ and\ncontinue with $g$ ). Consider $f|_{V}$ : $f$ is an isometry of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ hence $\\forall x,y\\in\\mathbb{R}^n:d(x,y)=d(f(x),f(y))$,\nin particular this holds for very $x,y\\in V$ . Let $E$ be the projection $E:\\mathbb{R}^n\\to\\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$. $E(V)=\\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$and\n$E\\circ f|_{V}$ is an isometry of $\\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ hence be the induction\nhypothesis it can be represented as $R=R_{1}\\circ...\\circ R_{n-1}$. We now expand $R$ to $\\mathbb{R}^n$ in this manner: denote the matrix representin\n$R$ as $R_{M}$ ($R_{M}\\in M_{n-1}(\\mathbb{R})$) then $R$ expanded to\n$\\mathbb{R}^n$ is represented by $\\begin{pmatrix}R & 0\\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}$that is : on the first $n-1$coordinates we act the same as $R$ did\nand we keep the last coordinate (note that $|R_{M}|=1$ and that it\nis straightforward to check that $R_{M}$ is an orthogonal matrix,\n$R_{1},...,R_{n}$are expanded from $\\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$to $R^{n}$ in the\nsame manner). Denote $\\varphi=R^{-1}\\circ f$ (here $R$ is the expended isometry\nto $\\mathbb{R}^n$). if $\\varphi(e_{n})=e_{n}$ then we are done, otherwise\nthere exist a reflection $\\alpha$ s.t $\\alpha\\circ\\varphi(e_{n})=e_{n}$and\ns.t $\\alpha|_{V}\\equiv f|_{V}$. (explicitly: $\\alpha$ is a rotation\naround the plane consistent of all points $v\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$ s.t $\\langle v,e_{n}-f(e_{n})\\rangle=0$). $\\varphi$ is at most $n-1$ reflections hence $\\alpha\\circ\\varphi$\nis at most $n$ reflections. In te first case $(f(0)\\neq0)$ we are doing the process with $\\tau\\circ f$\nhence in this case $f$ is represented by at most $n+1$ reflections. Any comment about the style of the proof is also welcomed, this is one of the times I am writing a proof in English.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Ok, here is my idea, I hope this is what you had in mind: We use one reflection to get an isometry with $f(0)=0$. I will now assume that $f$ has this property and will show that $n$ reflections suffice.\nedit: I should probably say at this point that the reason for step 1 is to use that $f$ is now norm-preserving (and thereby distance preserving) which simplifies the notation. I will inductively construct reflections $r_i$ such that their composition $r_1\\circ\\cdots\\circ r_n$ is the inverse of $f$. Since reflections are their own inverse this proves the statement. Assume that $f$ fixes a subspace $N$ of dimension $d$ (and this subspace is maximal in the sense that there exists no higher dimensional subspace which is fixed). We may then write $\\mathbb R^n=N\\bot N^\\bot$. I will show that we can find a reflection $r$, such that $r\\circ f$ fixes a subspace of one dimension higher. Take $0\\neq x\\in N^\\bot$. Then $x\\neq f(x)\\in N^\\bot$ since $0=\\left< x,n\\right>=\\left< f(x),f(n)\\right>=\\left< f(x),n\\right>$ for all $n\\in N$. Moreover $f(x)$ is either linearly independent to $x$ or just $-x$. Indeed assume $\\lambda f(x)=x$, then $\\left< x,x\\right>=\\left< f(x),f(x)\\right>=\\lambda^2\\left< x,x\\right>$ and $\\lambda^2=1$ with $\\lambda\\neq 1$ by assumption. If $f(x)=-x$, we just reflect $x$ and keep $N$ fixed at the same time and are done. Hence assume $f(x)$ and $x$ are linear independent. Find a basis of $N^\\bot$ containing $x$ and $f(x)$ namely $\\{x,f(x),b_1,...,b_k\\}$. Choose $u=x+f(x)$ and $v=x-f(x)$. Then $\\{u,v,b_1,...,b_k\\}$ is also a basis of $N^\\bot$, since $x=1/2(u+v)$ and $f(x)=1/2(u-v)$. Take $r$ te be the reflection which takes $v$ to $-v$ and fixes everthing else. Then $r\\circ f$ fixes the $d+1$-dimensional space $N\\bot \\mathbb Rx$. After $n$ steps we have (at most) $n$ reflections such that $r_1\\circ...\\circ r_n\\circ f$ is the identity. We are done.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is asking about proving that every isometry of ℝ^n can be written as a composition of at most n+1 reflections. The original question includes some details about their attempted induction proof and edits where they tried to fill in gaps. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions and the core problem. The example given by the user for another problem shows that assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nLooking at the problem here: the main goal is to prove that every isometry of ℝ^n is a composition of at most n+1 reflections. The user mentions using induction, starting from n=1, and discusses steps involving projections, reflections, and composing them. \n\nAssumptions here would need to be the conditions given or used in the problem. The problem statement itself doesn't list explicit assumptions beyond the general properties of isometries in ℝ^n. However, the user's approach uses induction, so perhaps the induction hypothesis is an assumption. Also, when they mention f(0)=0 after applying a reflection τ, that might be part of the assumptions in their step. But wait, the user is structuring the problem, not their proof attempt. So maybe the original problem's assumptions?\n\nWait, the original problem is: \"Prove that every isometry of ℝ^n is of the form of a composition of at most n+1 reflections.\" The user then provides their approach and proof attempt, but the core problem is that statement. The assumptions for the problem would be the properties of isometries in ℝ^n. But since the problem is general, the key assumption is that f is an isometry of ℝ^n. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- f is an isometry of ℝ^n.\n\nBut the user in their example included specific conditions like \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Here, perhaps the assumption is just that f is an isometry on ℝ^n. Wait, but the problem is to prove that every isometry can be written as such a composition. So the problem's assumption is that f is an isometry of ℝ^n, and the problem is to prove it can be written as ≤n+1 reflections. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- f is an isometry of ℝ^n.\n\nBut in the example, the user broke down each assumption into separate lines. Here, since there's only one main assumption (f is an isometry of ℝ^n), but maybe there's more. Wait, maybe the problem is under the standard Euclidean space structure? Or that reflections are through hyperplanes? But the problem as stated doesn't specify, so perhaps the main assumption is just that f is an isometry. \n\nSo, following the example's structure, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption: f is an isometry of ℝ^n.\n\nProblem: Prove that f can be expressed as a composition of at most n+1 reflections.\n\nBut the original problem mentions \"reflections through planes that don't necessarily have the 0 vector in them.\" However, in the problem statement, the user is just referring to reflections in general. So the key assumption is that f is an isometry in ℝ^n, and the problem is to show it's a composition of at most n+1 reflections. The user's own approach with induction and specific steps is part of their solution attempt, not the problem's assumptions. Therefore, the formatted problem should list the main assumption and the problem statement.",
