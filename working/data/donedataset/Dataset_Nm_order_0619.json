If $\\gcd(d,n) = 1$ then $\\zeta_n^k \\mapsto \\zeta_n^{kd}$ is a permutation of the roots, so $S(n,d) = S(n,1) = \\mu(n)$. If not, then write $d = gd'$ and $n = gn'$ where $g = \\gcd(d,n)$. We have $\\zeta_n^d = \\zeta_{n'}^{d'}$, and so $S(n,d) = \\phi(n)S(n',d')/\\phi(n')$. Then, since $\\gcd(n',d') = 1$, $S(n,d) = \\phi(n)\\mu(n',d')/\\phi(n')$.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's being asked. The user provided a question from Math Stack Exchange about cyclotomic polynomials and some series involving their derivatives. The goal is to structure the problem by listing assumptions and then stating the problem clearly. Let me parse through the original question carefully.\n\nThe title is \"Series of Cyclotomic polynomials,\" so the main topic is cyclotomic polynomials and series involving them. The question starts by defining the cyclotomic polynomial Φₙ(x) as the product over certain roots of unity, specifically for integers k from 1 to n that are coprime to n. The roots are x - ζₙ^k, where ζₙ is a primitive nth root of unity. Then, they mention the derivative Φ'_n(x) of this polynomial.\n\nThe problem presents two infinite series sums. The first sum is over n from 1 to infinity of (1/n⁴) times (Φ'_n(e²π)/Φ_n(e²π), and this is supposed to equal (45ζ(3))/(π⁴e²π) + 7/(4π e²π). The second sum is similar but with 1/n⁸ and the result involving ζ(7) and other terms.\n\nSo, the task is to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me recall the example provided. The original problem in the example had some assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Then the problem statement was to prove the divisibility. Here, the problem is about proving two specific series identities involving cyclotomic polynomials and their derivatives evaluated at e²π.\n\nFirst, I need to list all assumptions. The key here is to extract each individual condition or property applied to a single object. Let's break down the original question:\n\n1. Φₙ(x) is a cyclotomic polynomial defined as the product over (x - ζₙ^k) where 1 ≤ k ≤ n and gcd(n,k)=1. So, the first assumption is the definition of Φₙ(x).\n\n2. The derivative Φ'_n(x) is the derivative of Φₙ(x) with respect to x. So, that's another assumption about the derivative.\n\n3. The sums are from n=1 to infinity, so the problem is considering all positive integers n.\n\n4. The expressions involve evaluating Φ'_n and Φ_n at x = e²π. That's an important condition: x is set to e²π.\n\nAdditionally, perhaps there's an implicit assumption that the series converges, but since the problem states the sums equal specific values, maybe that's part of what needs to be proven rather than an assumption. However, sometimes in such problems, certain convergence criteria are assumed, but the user didn't mention any. Since the example didn't include convergence as an assumption, maybe it's not necessary here unless specified. The original problem doesn't mention any conditions on n other than being a positive integer, so perhaps the only assumptions are the definitions of the cyclotomic polynomial and its derivative, and the evaluation at e²π.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7, even though in the original problem statement, the user had \"for every integer n\". However, in the formatted version, the assistant included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. Wait, but in the original problem, the example's original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, perhaps the example had a typo or the user made a mistake. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe example's original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem listed assumptions as n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems conflicting because if the original problem is for every integer n, then why assume n is divisible by 7? That might be an error in the example. Maybe the example was incorrect, but the user wants us to follow the format regardless. Therefore, in the current problem, we need to list the assumptions as per the problem's given information.\n\nIn the current problem, the cyclotomic polynomial is defined for n ≥1, k from 1 to n with (n,k)=1. So, the assumptions would include:\n\n- Φₙ(x) is the cyclotomic polynomial defined as the product over 1 ≤ k ≤ n with gcd(n,k)=1 of (x - ζₙ^k).\n\n- Φ'_n(x) is the derivative of Φₙ(x) with respect to x.\n\n- The sums are taken over n starting from 1 to infinity.\n\n- The expressions Φ'_n(e²π) and Φ_n(e²π) are evaluated at x = e²π.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user didn't specify any particular constraints on n beyond it being a positive integer in the summation. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n1. For each integer n ≥ 1, Φₙ(x) is defined as ∏_{1 ≤ k ≤ n, gcd(n,k)=1} (x - ζₙ^k).\n\n2. Φ'_n(x) is the derivative of Φₙ(x) with respect to x.\n\n3. The sums are over all positive integers n.\n\n4. The expressions are evaluated at x = e^{2π}.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement in the example included specific assumptions even if they were part of the original problem's statement. So perhaps in this case, the assumptions are:\n\n- Φ_n(x) is a cyclotomic polynomial defined as ∏_{1 ≤ k ≤ n, (n,k)=1} (x - ζ_n^k).\n\n- Φ'_n(x) is the derivative of Φ_n(x).\n\n- The sums run from n=1 to ∞.\n\n- The expressions Φ'_n(e^{2π}) and Φ_n(e^{2π}) are considered.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is asking to show the equalities given those definitions, so those are the conditions. Therefore, each assumption should be a single line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo, structuring the assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\n\nΦₙ(x) is a cyclotomic polynomial defined as ∏_{1 ≤ k ≤ n, gcd(n,k)=1} (x - ζₙ^k),\n\nΦ'_ₙ(x) is the derivative of Φₙ(x),\n\nthe sum is taken over all positive integers n,\n\nthe expressions Φ'_ₙ(e^{2π}) and Φₙ(e^{2π}) are evaluated at x = e^{2π}.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumptions were about the variable in the problem. Here, the problem is about sums involving Φ'_n and Φ_n evaluated at a specific point. So perhaps the main assumptions are the definitions of the cyclotomic polynomial and its derivative, and the evaluation at x = e^{2π}. The summation over n=1 to ∞ is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Wait, the example included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, which was part of the original problem's quantifier. So in this case, the original problem's sums are over n=1 to ∞, which implies n is a positive integer. Therefore, perhaps \"n is a positive integer\" is an assumption here.\n\nBut the example's original problem said \"for every integer n\", and in the formatted problem, they listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. Similarly, here, since the sum is from n=1 to ∞, n is a positive integer, so that's an assumption.\n\nTherefore, compiling the assumptions:\n\n1. For each positive integer n, Φₙ(x) is the cyclotomic polynomial defined as ∏_{1 ≤ k ≤ n, gcd(n,k)=1} (x - ζₙ^k).\n\n2. Φ'_ₙ(x) is the derivative of Φₙ(x) with respect to x.\n\n3. The expressions Φₙ(e^{2π}) and Φ'_ₙ(e^{2π}) are evaluated at x = e^{2π}.\n\n4. The sums are taken over all positive integers n.\n\nBut in the example, each assumption is a single line, each applying to one object. So breaking down:\n\n- Φₙ(x) is a cyclotomic polynomial defined for each positive integer n as ∏_{1 ≤ k ≤ n, gcd(n,k)=1} (x - ζₙ^k).\n\n- For each positive integer n, Φ'_ₙ(x) is the derivative of Φₙ(x) with respect to x.\n\n- The expressions Φₙ(e^{2π}) and Φ'_ₙ(e^{2π}) are evaluated at x = e^{2π}.\n\n- The sums ∑_{n=1}^∞ involve positive integers n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps more precisely:\n\nAssumption:\n\nFor each positive integer n, Φₙ(x) is the cyclotomic polynomial defined by ∏_{1 ≤ k ≤ n, gcd(n,k)=1} (x - ζₙ^k),\n\nFor each positive integer n, Φ'_ₙ(x) denotes the derivative of Φₙ(x) with respect to x,\n\nThe variable x is set to e^{2π},\n\nThe sums are over all positive integers n.\n\nWait, but \"the variable x is set to e^{2π}\" is a condition applied to the evaluation point. So maybe:\n\n- x = e^{2π}.\n\nBut that's a single condition. However, in the example, assumptions were about the variables in the problem. Here, x is a variable in the cyclotomic polynomial, but in the problem statement, we're evaluating at x = e^{2π}, so perhaps that's an assumption.\n\nSo, compiling the assumptions line by line:\n\n1. For each positive integer n, Φₙ(x) is the cyclotomic polynomial defined as ∏_{1 ≤ k ≤ n, gcd(n,k)=1} (x - ζₙ^k).\n\n2. Φ'_ₙ(x) is the derivative of Φₙ(x) with respect to x.\n\n3. The expressions Φₙ(e^{2π}) and Φ'_ₙ(e^{2π}) are evaluated at x = e^{2π}.\n\n4. The sums ∑_{n=1}^∞ are taken over all positive integers n.\n\nBut the problem statement in the original question is asking to show the two equalities involving these sums. So the problem is to prove those two sums equal the given expressions.\n\nHence, the formatted problem should list all these assumptions and then state the problem as proving those two sums equal the given values.\n\nWait, but in the example, the problem was restated concisely. The user's original problem had a single A(n) expression, and the formatted problem had the problem as \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91.\"\n\nIn the current case, the problem has two separate sums to prove. However, the example only had one problem statement. So perhaps here, the problem is to show both of those equalities. But the user's format example had only one problem, but here there are two. Maybe the problem is to show both, so the problem statement would include both.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each sum is a separate problem, but the original question includes both. Since the user included both in the original problem, we should structure both as part of the problem statement.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n\nFor each positive integer n, Φₙ(x) is the cyclotomic polynomial defined as ∏_{1 ≤ k ≤ n, gcd(n,k)=1} (x - ζₙ^k),\n\nΦ'_ₙ(x) is the derivative of Φₙ(x) with respect to x,\n\nThe expressions Φₙ(e^{2π}) and Φ'_ₙ(e^{2π}) are evaluated at x = e^{2π},\n\nThe sums are taken over all positive integers n.\n\nProblem:\n\nShow that\n\n∑_{n=1}^∞ (1/n⁴) (Φ'_ₙ(e^{2π}) / Φₙ(e^{2π})) = (45ζ(3))/(π⁴e^{2π}) + 7/(4π e^{2π}),\n\nand\n\n∑_{n=1}^∞ (1/n⁸) (Φ'_ₙ(e^{2π}) / Φₙ(e^{2π})) = (4725ζ(7))/(π⁸e^{2π}) + 19/(12π e^{2π}).\n\nBut wait, in the example, assumptions were listed as separate bullet points, each on a new line. The original instruction says:\n\n\"Assumption: <All the assumptions... line by line. Each assumption addresses **only one property or condition**, applied to **one object**>\"\n\nSo each assumption must be a single line, each addressing one property or condition for one object.\n\nSo, breaking down:\n\n1. For each positive integer n, Φₙ(x) is defined as the product over 1 ≤ k ≤ n with gcd(n,k)=1 of (x - ζₙ^k).\n\n2. For each positive integer n, Φ'_ₙ(x) is the derivative of Φₙ(x) with respect to x.\n\n3. The expressions Φ'_ₙ(e^{2π}) and Φₙ(e^{2π}) are evaluated at x = e^{2π}.\n\n4. The sums ∑_{n=1}^∞ are considered over all positive integers n.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fourth point is part of the problem statement rather than an assumption. Because the problem is to compute the sum, the fact that the sum is from n=1 to infinity is part of what needs to be addressed. However, in the example, \"n is an integer\" was considered an assumption even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So perhaps here, \"n is a positive integer\" is an assumption because the sum is over n=1 to infinity, hence n is a positive integer. So:\n\n1. n is a positive integer.\n\nBut the definition of Φₙ(x) already requires n to be a positive integer. So maybe each assumption is:\n\n1. For each positive integer n, Φₙ(x) is the cyclotomic polynomial defined as ∏_{1 ≤ k ≤ n, gcd(n,k)=1} (x - ζₙ^k).\n\n2. For each positive integer n, Φ'_ₙ(x) is the derivative of Φₙ(x).\n\n3. The expressions Φ'_ₙ(e^{2π}) and Φₙ(e^{2π}) are evaluated at x = e^{2π}.\n\nThen the problem is to evaluate the two sums over positive integers n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"the sum is over all positive integers n\" is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Hmm, but the example included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption even though the problem said \"for every integer n\". So perhaps in this case, \"n is a positive integer\" is an assumption because the sum starts at n=1.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. n is a positive integer.\n\n2. For each positive integer n, Φₙ(x) is the cyclotomic polynomial defined as ∏_{1 ≤ k ≤ n, gcd(n,k)=1} (x - ζₙ^k).\n\n3. For each positive integer n, Φ'_ₙ(x) is the derivative of Φₙ(x).\n\n4. The expressions Φ'_ₙ(e^{2π}) and Φₙ(e^{2π}) are evaluated at x = e^{2π}.\n\nBut each assumption must apply to one object. So point 1 is about n, points 2 and 3 are about Φₙ(x) and its derivative, and point 4 is about the evaluation point.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first assumption is redundant because the cyclotomic polynomial is defined for positive integers n, so perhaps it's covered in assumption 2. But to be explicit, maybe it's better to list \"n is a positive integer\" as a separate assumption.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n\n- For each positive integer n, Φₙ(x) is the cyclotomic polynomial defined as ∏_{1 ≤ k ≤ n, gcd(n,k)=1} (x - ζₙ^k).\n\n- For each positive integer n, Φ'_ₙ(x) is the derivative of Φₙ(x).\n\n- The expressions Φ'_ₙ(e^{2π}) and Φₙ(e^{2π}) are evaluated at x = e^{2π}.\n\nThus, each assumption is a single line addressing one property.\n\nNow, the problem is to prove the two given sums equal the expressions on the right-hand side.\n\nHence, the formatted problem should list these assumptions and then state the problem as proving those two equalities.\n\nLet me check against the example again. In the example, the original problem had a quantifier \"for every integer n\", which became an assumption \"n is an integer\" and another assumption \"n is divisible by 7\". But in the original problem, it was \"for every integer n\", which didn't include divisibility by 7. Wait, that seems like a mistake in the example. It's possible that the example was incorrect, but the user wants us to follow the format. So perhaps in the example, the assumptions were extracted from the problem statement, even if they were part of the original problem's conditions. Therefore, in the current problem, we should list the assumptions as per the definitions and conditions given in the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the final structured problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\nn is a positive integer,\n\nFor each positive integer n, Φₙ(x) is the cyclotomic polynomial defined as ∏_{1 ≤ k ≤ n, gcd(n,k)=1} (x - ζₙ^k),\n\nFor each positive integer n, Φ'_ₙ(x) is the derivative of Φₙ(x),\n\nThe expressions Φ'_ₙ(e^{2π}) and Φₙ(e^{2π}) are evaluated at x = e^{2π}.\n\nProblem:\n\nShow that\n\n∑_{n=1}^∞ (1/n⁴)(Φ'_ₙ(e^{2π})/Φₙ(e^{2π})) = (45ζ(3))/(π⁴e^{2π}) + 7/(4π e^{2π}),\n\nand\n\n∑_{n=1}^∞ (1/n⁸)(Φ'_ₙ(e^{2π})/Φₙ(e^{2π})) = (4725ζ(7))/(π⁸e^{2π}) + 19/(12π e^{2π}).\n\nThis seems to fit the required format. Each assumption is a single line, addressing one property or condition applied to one object. The problem is stated clearly with the two sums to be proven.",
