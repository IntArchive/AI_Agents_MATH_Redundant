    "Content": "In $\\mathbb{R}^n$ we prove that a set is compact (using the definition about open covers) if and only if it's closed and bounded. It is pretty clear that if $\\mathcal{O}$ is an open cover of one unbounded set $X$, then $\\mathcal{O}$ cannot have a finite subcover, it'll clearly need in general infinitely many sets to cover the set $X$. Now, if a set isn't closed, I cannot see in which way it fails to be compact. For instance, if $X$ is the closed unit ball centered at the origin, then it is compact. If on the other hand we consider $Y=X\\setminus\\{0\\}$, then it's not compact anymore, because $Y$ isn't closed (the point $0$ is a limit point of $X$ and so, $0 \\in \\operatorname{Cl}(X)$ and on the same time $0 \\notin Y$. So, what should be the intuition about this? How can we intuitively see that $Y$ isn't compact? Thanks very much in advance!",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this Math Stack Exchange question. The user is asking why sets that aren't closed can't be compact, especially in the context of ℝⁿ where the Heine-Borel theorem applies. They mention that for a set to be compact in ℝⁿ, it must be closed and bounded. The user understands that unbounded sets aren't compact because open covers can't have finite subcovers. However, they're struggling to see why a non-closed set fails to be compact.\n\nThe example given is the closed unit ball X, which is compact, versus Y = X \\ {0}, which isn't closed (since 0 is a limit point not in Y). The user wants an intuitive understanding of why Y isn't compact. \n\nFirst, I need to structure this into the required format. The assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. The original problem states that in ℝⁿ, compactness is equivalent to being closed and bounded. The example uses Y, which is X without {0}, so Y is bounded but not closed. The problem is to see why Y isn't compact. \n\nWait, the user's main problem is understanding why non-closed sets (even if bounded) aren't compact. The specific example is Y, which is the closed unit ball minus the origin. So the assumptions would include that Y is a subset of ℝⁿ, Y is bounded, Y is not closed, and perhaps that ℝⁿ uses the standard definition of compactness (open covers have finite subcovers). \n\nBut the user is asking for the intuition behind this failure. The answer likely involves constructing an open cover of Y that has no finite subcover. For instance, around the missing limit point 0, you can create a sequence of open sets that get closer to 0 but never include it. Each open set in the cover would exclude a neighborhood of 0, but since 0 isn't in Y, you need infinitely many such sets to cover Y. \n\nBut the task here is to structure the original problem into assumptions and problem statement. The user's problem is not to prove something specific but to understand why Y isn't compact. However, in the example provided by the user, the formatted problem turns the original into a specific problem statement. So perhaps here, the problem is to show that Y is not compact, given that it's not closed (and bounded). \n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be: Y is a subset of ℝⁿ, Y is bounded, Y is not closed. The problem is to show that Y is not compact. Alternatively, the problem could be to understand why Y is not compact. But the user is seeking an explanation, so maybe the problem is \"Why is Y not compact?\" given those assumptions. \n\nWait, the original question is more general: \"Why sets that aren't closed can't be compact?\" but the example given is specific. So to structure it, maybe the assumptions are that we're working in ℝⁿ where Heine-Borel applies, the set in question is bounded but not closed. Then the problem is to show that such a set is not compact. But the user is asking for the intuition, so perhaps the problem is \"Why can't a bounded but not closed set in ℝⁿ be compact?\" \n\nAlternatively, considering the example, the specific problem is: Why is Y = X \\ {0} (where X is the closed unit ball) not compact? So the assumptions would be: Y is the closed unit ball in ℝⁿ without the origin, Y is bounded, Y is not closed. Problem: Show that Y is not compact. \n\nBut the user's general question is about non-closed sets, so maybe the structured problem should reflect that generality. However, the example given by the user (the A(n) problem) took a specific problem from the original. So perhaps here, the formatted problem should focus on the specific example, as the user provided a specific case. \n\nSo, the assumptions would be: Y is a subset of ℝⁿ, Y is the closed unit ball centered at the origin without the point 0, Y is bounded, Y is not closed. Problem: Show that Y is not compact. \n\nAlternatively, to make it more general, the assumptions could be: Consider a set in ℝⁿ that is bounded but not closed. Problem: Prove that such a set is not compact. \n\nBut the example in the user's original formatted problem kept the problem as the specific A(n) expression. So perhaps here, the structured problem would be the specific case mentioned by the user. Let me check the original question again. \n\nOriginal question title: \"Why sets that aren't closed can't be compact?\" The body discusses the general case but uses Y = X \\ {0} as an example. The user wants to understand the intuition, especially in the example. \n\nSo, to structure this into the format: \n\nAssumptions: \n- The space is ℝⁿ.\n- A compact set in ℝⁿ must be closed and bounded (per Heine-Borel theorem).\n- Y is a subset of ℝⁿ.\n- Y is bounded.\n- Y is not closed.\nProblem: Explain why Y is not compact. \n\nBut the example given in the user's initial prompt had specific assumptions (n is an integer, n divisible by 7) leading to a specific problem. Here, the user is asking a general question but with a specific example. Maybe the structured problem should focus on the example. \n\nThus, the assumptions would be: \n- Y is the closed unit ball in ℝⁿ centered at the origin without the point 0.\n- Y is bounded.\n- Y is not closed (since 0 is a limit point not in Y).\nProblem: Show that Y is not compact. \n\nAlternatively, since the Heine-Borel theorem is given, the problem could be to apply it, but the user is asking why Y isn't compact despite being bounded. The answer lies in not being closed, but they want the intuition. So the problem is to see why Y fails compactness. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would list the assumptions about Y (bounded, not closed, subset of ℝⁿ) and the problem is to show it's not compact. \n\nBut in the example provided by the user, the original problem mentioned divisibility by 91, but the formatted problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, in that example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for any integer n. The formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem had assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that's adding an extra condition. Wait, maybe that was a mistake in the example? Or perhaps the user intended to structure the problem with possible hidden assumptions. Wait, maybe the example was a different problem. Let me recheck. \n\nOriginal example: \n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems incorrect. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem restricts n to be divisible by 7. That changes the problem. Perhaps there was a mistake in the example. But the user provided that example, so maybe they intended to include an extra assumption. However, in the actual case, the answer would need to be structured correctly. \n\nIn any case, returning to the current problem. The user's example might have been incorrectly formatted, but we need to follow the instruction to structure the given problem into assumptions and problem. \n\nSo, for the current problem, the user is asking why sets that aren't closed can't be compact, with the example of Y = closed unit ball minus origin. The key assumptions here are that Y is bounded but not closed in ℝⁿ. The problem is to show that Y is not compact. \n\nTherefore, structuring it:\n\nAssumption:\n- Y is a subset of ℝⁿ,\n- Y is bounded,\n- Y is not closed,\n- The space ℝⁿ is equipped with the standard topology.\n\nProblem:\nProve that Y is not compact.\n\nAlternatively, since the Heine-Borel theorem is given, the problem can be directly inferred from the theorem, but the user is asking for the intuition, which in the example is demonstrated by constructing an open cover without a finite subcover. \n\nBut according to the user's example, the formatted problem should list all assumptions line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. So for the Y example:\n\nAssumption:\n- Y is the closed unit ball in ℝⁿ centered at the origin without the origin point,\n- Y is bounded,\n- Y is not closed (as the origin is a limit point not in Y),\n- Compactness in ℝⁿ is equivalent to being closed and bounded (Heine-Borel theorem).\n\nBut wait, the Heine-Borel theorem is a result, not an assumption. Maybe the assumptions are about the properties of Y and the space. The problem then is to show Y isn't compact. \n\nBut the user wants to understand why Y isn't compact, given it's not closed. The answer is that in ℝⁿ, by Heine-Borel, compact ⇨ closed and bounded. Since Y is not closed, it's not compact. But the user wants the intuition, so the problem is to show this without invoking Heine-Borel, perhaps by constructing an open cover with no finite subcover. \n\nThus, the structured problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- Y is a subset of ℝⁿ,\n- Y is equal to the closed unit ball centered at the origin minus the origin point,\n- Y is bounded,\n- Y is not closed.\n\nProblem:\nShow that Y is not compact by demonstrating an open cover of Y with no finite subcover.\n\nAlternatively, more generally:\n\nAssumption:\n- K is a subset of ℝⁿ,\n- K is bounded,\n- K is not closed.\n\nProblem:\nProve that K is not compact.\n\nBut the user's example is specific to Y = X \\ {0}, so maybe the problem should be specific. \n\nIn the example given by the user, they structured a problem by extracting assumptions from the original problem, even adding an assumption (n divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original. But that might have been an error. However, following the user's example, perhaps we should list the relevant assumptions from the original question. \n\nOriginal question states that in ℝⁿ, compact iff closed and bounded. Then considers Y = X \\ {0}, which is bounded but not closed. So the assumptions for Y are:\n\n- Y is a subset of ℝⁿ,\n- Y is bounded,\n- Y is not closed,\n- X is the closed unit ball in ℝⁿ,\n- Y = X \\ {0}.\n\nProblem: Prove that Y is not compact.\n\nBut the Heine-Borel theorem is a theorem, not an assumption. So perhaps the key assumptions are about Y's properties. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\n- Y is the closed unit ball in ℝⁿ centered at the origin without the origin point,\n- Y is bounded,\n- Y is not closed.\n\nProblem:\nProve that Y is not compact.\n\nBut the user also mentions that in ℝⁿ, compactness is equivalent to closed and bounded. So perhaps the problem is to apply Heine-Borel to conclude Y isn't compact. But the user wants the intuition, so maybe the problem is to demonstrate via open covers. \n\nTherefore, the structured problem should reflect the user's need to see why Y isn't compact, which is done by constructing an open cover with no finite subcover. \n\nThus:\n\nAssumption:\n- Y is the closed unit ball in ℝⁿ centered at the origin without the origin point,\n- Y is equipped with the subspace topology from ℝⁿ.\n\nProblem:\nConstruct an open cover of Y that has no finite subcover, thereby showing Y is not compact.\n\nAlternatively, since compactness is defined via open covers, the problem is to demonstrate such a cover. \n\nIn the user's example, the formatted problem took a general statement and added an assumption (n divisible by 7), which might have been a mistake. But in our case, we need to accurately represent the original question. \n\nThe original question's core is: Why aren't non-closed sets compact? The example is Y = closed unit ball minus origin. So the structured problem should be about Y. \n\nFinal answer: The assumptions are the properties of Y (subset of ℝⁿ, bounded, not closed), and the problem is to show Y is not compact. However, to match the user's example where specific assumptions were listed (even if possibly incorrect), we structure it as:\n\nAssumption:\n- Y is a subset of ℝⁿ,\n- Y is the closed unit ball centered at the origin without the origin point,\n- Y is bounded,\n- Y is not closed.\n\nProblem:\nProve that Y is not compact.",
