    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The question says that if a simple graph G has 11 or more vertices, then either G or its complement is not planar. Hmm, I remember that planar graphs have certain restrictions, like Kuratowski's theorem which mentions K5 and K3,3 as non-planar, but maybe that's not directly useful here. \n\nWait, there's also Euler's formula for planar graphs: v - e + f = 2. And I recall that for a planar graph without any cycles of length 3, the number of edges e is at most 3v - 6. If there are no triangles, it's even less, but maybe that's not the case here. Since we're dealing with the graph and its complement, maybe we need to consider the total number of edges in both G and its complement. \n\nThe complement of G, denoted as \\overline{G}, would have all the edges not present in G. So the total number of edges in G plus the edges in \\overline{G} should be equal to the total number of possible edges in a complete graph with v vertices, which is C(v,2) = v(v-1)/2. \n\nIf G is planar, then the number of edges in G must be ≤ 3v - 6. Similarly, if \\overline{G} is planar, then its edges must also be ≤ 3v - 6. So adding both, the total edges would be ≤ 3v - 6 + 3v - 6 = 6v - 12. But the total possible edges are v(v-1)/2. So if v is such that v(v-1)/2 > 6v - 12, then at least one of G or \\overline{G} must exceed 3v - 6 edges, making it non-planar. \n\nLet's set up the inequality: v(v-1)/2 > 6v - 12. Multiply both sides by 2: v(v-1) > 12v - 24. Simplify: v² - v > 12v -24 → v² -13v +24 >0. Let's solve v² -13v +24 =0. The discriminant is 169 -96=73. So roots at [13 ±√73]/2. √73 is about 8.544, so roots are approximately (13 +8.544)/2 ≈10.772 and (13-8.544)/2≈2.228. So the quadratic is positive when v <2.228 or v>10.772. Since v is the number of vertices and must be an integer ≥11, then for v≥11, the inequality holds. Therefore, for v≥11, the total edges in G and \\overline{G} would exceed 6v -12, so at least one of them must have more than 3v-6 edges, hence not planar. \n\nWait, but the original problem says \"11 or more vertices\", so when v=11, this holds. So the key idea is that the sum of edges in G and its complement exceeds twice the maximum edges allowed for planar graphs (since each can have at most 3v-6 edges). Therefore, one of them must exceed this limit. \n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be that G is a simple graph with 11 or more vertices, and we need to prove that either G or its complement is non-planar. The problem doesn't state any additional constraints, so the main assumption is about the number of vertices. \n\nWait, but in the example given by the user, the assumption included both that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. However, in this problem, the main condition is the number of vertices. So perhaps the assumption here is only that G is a simple graph with 11 or more vertices. But maybe I need to check if there are any other implicit assumptions. The problem says \"simple graph\", so loops and multiple edges are disallowed. But since the user's example lists each assumption line by line, maybe I should list \"G is a simple graph\" and \"G has 11 or more vertices\" as separate assumptions. \n\nSo the formatted problem would have assumptions:\n- G is a simple graph,\n- G has 11 or more vertices.\n\nAnd the problem is to prove that either G or its complement is not planar. \n\nBut wait, the original question's problem statement was: \"If a simple graph G has 11 or more vertices, then either G or its complement is not planar.\" So the user's example included two assumptions for the original problem, even though in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer, and another assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, the expression is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem included an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe that example was incorrect? Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might have been a mistake. \n\nWait, perhaps the user provided an example where they might have mistakenly added the divisibility by 7. But the original problem was to prove for every integer n, so the assumptions should just be that n is an integer. But in the example, the formatted problem includes \"n is divisible by 7\" which is not in the original problem. That seems incorrect. Maybe the user made an error in their example. \n\nBut regardless, following their instruction, I need to list all the assumptions line by line. So for the current problem, the original problem states that G is a simple graph with 11 or more vertices. So the assumptions are:\n- G is a simple graph,\n- G has 11 or more vertices.\n\nThe problem is to prove that either G or its complement is not planar. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have these two assumptions. Let me check if there are any other hidden assumptions. For example, the graph is undirected, no multiple edges, etc., but \"simple graph\" already covers that. So the two assumptions are correct.",
