    "Content": "Month ago I encounter a nice result numerically checked by Mathematica $$\n\\int_{0}^{\\pi/2} \\int_{0}^{\\pi/2} \\frac{\\theta\\cot\\theta-\\varphi\\cot\\varphi}{\\cos\\theta-\\cos\\varphi} \\mathrm{d}\\varphi\\mathrm{d}\\theta = \\pi\\ln2\n$$ where the integrated function is actually well-defined even around its singularity $\\theta=\\varphi=0$ . At my first sight, I thought it might be a trivial conclusion derived from a kind of typical integral like $$\n\\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\frac{\\cos n\\theta}{\\cos\\theta-\\cos\\varphi} \\mathrm{d}\\theta = \\pi\\frac{\\sin n\\varphi}{\\sin\\varphi}\n$$ just using a proper series expansion. However, when I review it in detail, the result over $(0,\\pi/2)$ will be awkwardly complicated. I realize this double integrals may not be done directly, or I may lack some essential insight to solve it. So I question it here for some further discussion, and thanks in advance for any suggestion.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here is a solution based on @G Cab 's remarkable observation. Reduction. Let $I$ denote the integral, and apply the substitution $(\\theta,\\varphi)\\mapsto(2\\theta,2\\varphi)$ to write $$ I = 4 \\int_{0}^{\\pi/4} \\int_{0}^{\\pi/4} \\frac{2\\theta\\cot(2\\theta) - 2\\varphi \\cot(2\\varphi)}{\\cos(2\\theta)-\\cos(2\\varphi)} \\, \\mathrm{d}\\theta\\mathrm{d}\\varphi. $$ If we define the $1$ -form $\\omega$ by $$ \\omega = \\left( \\log\\frac{\\cot\\theta}{\\cot\\varphi} \\right) \\biggl( \\frac{\\mathrm{d}( (\\theta-\\varphi)^2 )}{2\\sin^2(\\theta-\\varphi)} - \\frac{\\mathrm{d}( (\\theta+\\varphi)^2 )}{2\\sin^2(\\theta+\\varphi)} \\biggr), $$ then $\\omega$ is smooth in the region $(0, \\pi/2)^2$ via continuation along the diagonal $\\varphi = \\theta$ . Moreover, @G Cab 's computation for the differential reduces to 1) $$ \\mathrm{d}\\omega\n= 4 \\left( \\frac{2\\theta\\cot(2\\theta) - 2\\varphi \\cot(2\\varphi)}{\\cos(2\\theta)-\\cos(2\\varphi)} \\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\theta \\wedge \\mathrm{d}\\varphi. $$ Now let $\\epsilon > 0$ be small and consider the triangular region $$ \\mathcal{T}_{\\epsilon} = \\bigl\\{ (\\theta, \\varphi) : \\epsilon \\leq \\varphi \\leq \\theta \\leq \\tfrac{\\pi}{4} \\bigr\\}. $$ Its boundary $\\partial\\mathcal{T}_{\\epsilon}$ consists of three oriented line segments Then by the symmetry and the Stokes' theorem, \\begin{align*}\nI\n&= 2 \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} \\int_{\\mathcal{T}_{\\epsilon}} \\mathrm{d}\\omega\n= 2 \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} \\int_{\\partial \\mathcal{T}_{\\epsilon}} \\omega\n= 2 (I_{\\rightarrow} + I_{\\uparrow} + I_{\\swarrow}),\n\\end{align*} where $\\rightarrow$ , $\\uparrow$ , and $\\swarrow$ denote the oriented bottom/height/hypothenus of $\\partial\\mathcal{T}_{\\epsilon}$ , respectively, and $$ I_{\\bullet} =  \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} \\int_{\\bullet} \\omega $$ for each $\\bullet \\in \\{ \\rightarrow, \\uparrow, \\swarrow \\}$ . Integral Computations. We will evaluate each $I_{\\bullet}$ : 1. It is not hard to check that $\\omega = 0$ along $\\varphi = \\theta$ , and so, we get $I_{\\swarrow} = 0$ . 2. For $I_{\\uparrow}$ , we note that \\begin{align*}\nI_{\\uparrow}\n&= \\int_{\\varphi = 0}^{\\varphi = \\pi/4} \\omega|_{\\theta=\\pi/4} \\\\\n&= \\int_{\\varphi = 0}^{\\varphi = \\pi/4} \\left( - \\log\\cot\\varphi \\right) \\biggl( \\frac{\\mathrm{d}( (\\pi/4-\\varphi)^2 )}{2\\sin^2(\\pi/4-\\varphi)} - \\frac{\\mathrm{d}( (\\pi/4+\\varphi)^2 )}{2\\sin^2(\\pi/4+\\varphi)} \\biggr) \\\\\n&= 2 \\int_{0}^{\\pi/4} \\left( \\log\\cot\\varphi \\right) \\biggl( \\frac{\\pi/4-\\varphi}{1-\\sin(2\\varphi)} + \\frac{\\pi/4+\\varphi}{1+\\sin(2\\varphi)} \\biggr) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\varphi \\\\\n&= 2 \\int_{-\\pi/4}^{\\pi/4} \\frac{\\pi/4+\\varphi}{1+\\sin(2\\varphi)} \\log \\left| \\cot\\varphi \\right|  \\, \\mathrm{d}\\varphi \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\frac{x}{1-\\cos x} \\log \\left| \\cot \\left(\\frac{x}{2} - \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\right|  \\, \\mathrm{d}x,\n\\end{align*} where the last step is the result of the substitution $\\varphi=\\tfrac{x}{2}-\\tfrac{\\pi}{4}$ . Then by noting that $$ \\log \\left| \\cot \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4} - \\frac{x}{2} \\right) \\right|\n= \\operatorname{Re}\\log\\left(\\frac{1-ie^{ix}}{1+ie^{ix}}\\right)\n= i (\\arctan(e^{-ix}) - \\arctan(e^{ix})), $$ we get \\begin{align*}\nI_{\\uparrow}\n&= \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\frac{ix}{1-\\cos x} (\\arctan(e^{-ix}) - \\arctan(e^{ix}))  \\, \\mathrm{d}x \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} \\frac{ix}{1-\\cos x} \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4} - \\arctan(e^{ix})\\right)  \\, \\mathrm{d}x \\\\\n&= i \\int_{\\mathcal{C}} \\frac{(\\log z )(\\frac{\\pi}{4} - \\arctan z)}{(z-1)^2}  \\, \\mathrm{d}z,\n\\end{align*} where the substitution $z = e^{ix}$ is applied to the last step and $\\mathcal{C}$ is the path parametrized by $e^{ix}$ for $-\\pi < x < \\pi$ . Now deforming the contour $\\mathcal{C}$ so as to enclose the principal branch cut for $\\log$ , \\begin{align*}\nI_{\\uparrow}\n&= 2\\pi \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{\\frac{\\pi}{4} + \\arctan t}{(t+1)^2}  \\, \\mathrm{d}t\n= 2\\pi \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{1}{(t^2+1)(t+1)} \\, \\mathrm{d}t\n= \\frac{\\pi^2}{4} + \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\log 2.\n\\end{align*} 3. For the integral along the bottom, \\begin{align*}\n\\int_{\\rightarrow} \\omega\n&= \\int_{\\theta = \\epsilon}^{\\theta = \\pi/4} \\omega|_{\\varphi=\\epsilon} \\\\\n&= \\int_{\\theta = \\epsilon}^{\\theta = \\pi/4} \\log\\left( \\frac{\\cot\\theta}{\\cot\\epsilon} \\right) \\biggl( \\frac{\\mathrm{d}( (\\theta-\\epsilon)^2 )}{2\\sin^2(\\theta-\\epsilon)} - \\frac{\\mathrm{d}( (\\theta+\\epsilon)^2 )}{2\\sin^2(\\theta+\\epsilon)} \\biggr) \\\\\n&= \\int_{\\epsilon}^{\\pi/4} \\log\\left( \\frac{\\cot\\theta}{\\cot\\epsilon} \\right) \\biggl( \\frac{\\theta-\\epsilon}{\\sin^2(\\theta-\\epsilon)} - \\frac{\\theta+\\epsilon}{2\\sin^2(\\theta+\\epsilon)} \\biggr) \\,  \\mathrm{d}\\theta.\n\\end{align*} Substituting $\\theta = \\epsilon x$ , \\begin{align*}\n\\int_{\\rightarrow} \\omega\n&= \\int_{1}^{\\pi/4\\epsilon} \\log\\left( \\frac{\\cot(\\epsilon x)}{\\cot\\epsilon} \\right) \\biggl( \\frac{\\epsilon^2 (x-1)}{\\sin^2(\\epsilon(x-1))} - \\frac{\\epsilon^2 (x+1)}{2\\sin^2(\\epsilon(x+1))} \\biggr) \\, \\mathrm{d}x.\n\\end{align*} It is not hard (although not entirely trivial) to show that the above integral converges to \\begin{align*}\nI_{\\rightarrow}\n= \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} \\int_{\\rightarrow} \\omega\n= \\int_{1}^{\\infty} (-\\log x) \\biggl( \\frac{1}{x-1} - \\frac{1}{x+1} \\biggr) \\, \\mathrm{d}x\n= -\\frac{\\pi^2}{4}.\n\\end{align*} Conclusion. Combining all these observations altogether, we have $$ \\bbox[10px,#ffd]{ I = 2 (I_{\\rightarrow} + I_{\\uparrow} + I_{\\swarrow}) = \\pi \\log 2 } $$ as desired. ${}^{1)}$ We include the sketch of computation for $\\mathrm{d}\\omega$ , which is essentially @G Cab 's computation in backward direction. Substituting $u=\\theta-\\phi$ and $v=\\theta+\\phi$ , $$ \\omega = \\left( \\log \\left( \\frac{\\sin v - \\sin u}{\\sin v + \\sin u} \\right) \\right)\\biggl( \\frac{u \\, \\mathrm{d}u}{\\sin^2 u} - \\frac{v \\, \\mathrm{d}v}{\\sin^2 v} \\biggr) . $$ Taking $\\mathrm{d}$ , \\begin{align*}\n\\mathrm{d}\\omega\n&= \\mathrm{d}\\left( \\frac{u}{\\sin^2 u} \\log \\left( \\frac{\\sin v - \\sin u}{\\sin u + \\sin v} \\right) \\right) \\wedge \\mathrm{d}u \\\\\n&\\qquad - \\mathrm{d}\\left( \\frac{v}{\\sin^2 v} \\log \\left( \\frac{\\sin v - \\sin u}{\\sin u + \\sin v} \\right) \\right) \\wedge \\mathrm{d}v \\\\\n&= \\frac{u}{\\sin^2 u} \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v} \\log \\left( \\frac{\\sin v - \\sin u}{\\sin u + \\sin v} \\right) \\right) \\mathrm{d}v  \\wedge \\mathrm{d}u\\\\\n&\\qquad - \\frac{v}{\\sin^2 v} \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u} \\log \\left( \\frac{\\sin v - \\sin u}{\\sin u + \\sin v} \\right) \\right) \\mathrm{d}u \\wedge \\mathrm{d}v \\\\\n&= 4 \\left( \\frac{v \\cos u \\csc v - u \\cos v \\csc u}{\\cos(2u) - \\cos (2v)} \\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}u \\wedge \\mathrm{d}v.\n\\end{align*} By noting that $\\mathrm{d}u \\wedge \\mathrm{d}v = 2 \\, \\mathrm{d}\\theta \\wedge \\mathrm{d} \\varphi$ , the question boils down to showing $$ 2 \\left( \\frac{v \\cos u \\csc v - u \\cos v \\csc u}{\\cos(2u) - \\cos (2v)} \\right) = \\frac{(v+u)\\cot(v+u) - (v-u)\\cot(v-u)}{\\cos(v+u) - \\cos(v-u)}. $$ This can be verified by expanding the right-hand side.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format a problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified structure. The example provided shows that assumptions should list each condition line by line, addressing one property per object. Then the problem statement is written clearly.\n\nLooking at the original problem here: the user wants to prove a double integral over [0, π/2] for both variables, involving (θcotθ - φcotφ)/(cosθ - cosφ) resulting in π ln2. The question mentions that the function is well-defined even around the singularity at θ=φ=0.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states it's a double integral over θ and φ from 0 to π/2. The integrand is given, and there's a note about the function being well-defined despite the singularity. However, in the example, the assumption included specific conditions like n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the variables θ and φ are integrated over [0, π/2], so the limits are part of the problem's setup. Additionally, the integrand's singularity at θ=φ is mentioned, but the function is stated to be well-defined there. So perhaps the assumptions are that θ and φ are in [0, π/2], and the integrand is defined despite the singularity.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included n being an integer. Here, θ and φ are integration variables, so maybe the assumptions are about their domains. The problem is a definite integral, so the limits are part of the problem statement. However, the example included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem's explicit statement (like n divisible by 7 in the example). Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait no, maybe the example was a different problem. Let me check again.\n\nThe example given was:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(...) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that seems like a mistake. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an extra condition that n is divisible by 7. That might be an error in the example. But perhaps the example was from a different problem where the user wanted to filter out an assumption. Maybe the user made a typo. Anyway, the user is providing that example as how they want the formatting done.\n\nSo in the current problem, the user's example might have mistakenly added an assumption not present in the original, but in reality, the task is to filter out unrelated information and structure the problem with assumptions. So for the given integral problem, the assumptions would be the domain of integration for θ and φ, and perhaps the well-defined nature of the integrand despite the singularity.\n\nWait, but the problem statement already includes the integral limits. The problem is to compute the double integral from 0 to π/2 for both variables. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- θ is in [0, π/2]\n- φ is in [0, π/2]\n- The integrand is well-defined at θ=φ (since the question mentions that)\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about the variable n. So translating that here, the variables θ and φ have their domains specified as [0, π/2], and the integrand is defined even when θ=φ.\n\nSo structuring this:\n\nAssumption:\nθ is in the interval [0, π/2],\nφ is in the interval [0, π/2],\nThe integrand (θcotθ - φcotφ)/(cosθ - cosφ) is well-defined at θ = φ.\n\nProblem:\nProve that\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\pi/2} \\int_{0}^{\\pi/2} \\frac{\\theta\\cot\\theta - \\varphi\\cot\\varphi}{\\cos\\theta - \\cos\\varphi} \\, \\mathrm{d}\\varphi \\, \\mathrm{d}\\theta = \\pi \\ln 2\n$$\n\nBut I need to make sure each assumption addresses only one property or condition applied to one object. So θ and φ each have their interval. Then the integrand's well-definedness is another assumption. However, the problem statement mentions that the function is well-defined, so perhaps that's part of the problem's given conditions. Therefore, the assumptions would be the domains of integration for each variable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem's integral is over θ and φ each from 0 to π/2, so the assumptions are that θ and φ are integrated over these intervals. Each variable's domain is a separate assumption.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nθ is integrated over [0, π/2],\nφ is integrated over [0, π/2],\nThe integrand is well-defined for all θ and φ in [0, π/2].\n\nBut the user's example had two assumptions: n is integer, n divisible by 7. The original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added n divisible by 7. Wait, perhaps the user's example was incorrect, but regardless, the instruction is to filter unrelated info and structure as per the example. So perhaps in the current problem, the key assumptions are the integration limits for both variables and the well-defined integrand.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the integrand being well-defined is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. The user mentions that the function is actually well-defined, which might be part of the problem's given conditions.\n\nBut according to the example, assumptions are properties or conditions applied to one object. So in the example, n is an integer and n divisible by 7. So each assumption is about one object. Here, θ and φ are two different variables, so their domains would each be separate assumptions.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nθ is a real number in the interval [0, π/2],\nφ is a real number in the interval [0, π/2],\nThe integrand is defined for all θ and φ in [0, π/2].\n\nBut the problem statement mentions that the function is well-defined even around θ=φ=0. So maybe that's an assumption that the integrand is defined despite the singularity. However, in the example, the assumption added an extra condition not explicitly in the original problem. Wait, in the example, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. But perhaps the user intended to show that assumptions can be filtered from the original problem. Maybe the example was a mistake, but the user wants us to follow the format.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question says \"the integrated function is actually well-defined even around its singularity θ=φ=0\". So that's part of the problem's given conditions. Therefore, as assumptions, we might include:\n\n- The integrand is well-defined at θ = φ = 0.\n\nBut θ and φ are both in [0, π/2], so their domains are part of the problem setup. The user's example included assumptions even if they were part of the problem's original statement. So following the example's structure, the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem, each on a separate line.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nθ is integrated over [0, π/2],\nφ is integrated over [0, π/2],\nThe integrand is well-defined at θ = φ = 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the double integral equals π ln2.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumptions were more about the variables' properties (n is integer, divisible by 7). In the current problem, the variables' domains are part of the problem's integral limits. But perhaps in the example, the original problem's integral didn't specify n's conditions, but here, the integral's limits are part of the problem statement, so maybe they don't need to be listed as assumptions. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, let's check the example again. Original problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. Formatted assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. Unless there was a mistake in the example. Perhaps the original problem in the example had a different condition, but the user provided a wrong example.\n\nAssuming that the example is correct as per the user's instruction, maybe the task is to list all conditions applied to each object, even if they are part of the problem's original statement. Therefore, for the current problem:\n\nThe integral is over θ from 0 to π/2 and φ from 0 to π/2. So assumptions would be:\n\n- θ is a variable integrated from 0 to π/2,\n- φ is a variable integrated from 0 to π/2,\n- The integrand is well-defined at θ = φ.\n\nBut maybe the problem statement doesn't require θ and φ to be variables integrated over those intervals as assumptions, since it's part of the integral's notation. However, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which was listed as an assumption. So translating that, the variables' domains (θ and φ in [0, π/2]) would be assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the example, the assumption was n is an integer, and the problem is to prove A(n) divisible by 91 under that assumption. But the formatted problem added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7, which might not be correct. Maybe the example was a mistake, but the user wants us to follow the format regardless.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, perhaps the safest way is to list the integration limits as assumptions about θ and φ's domains, and the well-definedness of the integrand.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nθ is in the interval [0, π/2],\nφ is in the interval [0, π/2],\nThe integrand is well-defined for all θ and φ in [0, π/2].\n\nProblem:\nProve that\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\pi/2} \\int_{0}^{\\pi/2} \\frac{\\theta\\cot\\theta - \\varphi\\cot\\varphi}{\\cos\\theta - \\cos\\varphi} \\, \\mathrm{d}\\varphi \\, \\mathrm{d}\\theta = \\pi \\ln 2\n$$\n\nBut the original problem mentions the singularity at θ=φ=0, but the integrand is well-defined there. So maybe the third assumption is that the integrand is defined at θ=φ.\n\nBut the integrand has a denominator cosθ - cosφ, which when θ=φ, the denominator is zero. However, the numerator also becomes zero (θcotθ - θcotθ = 0), so it's a 0/0 form. The problem states that the function is well-defined there, so perhaps the assumption is that the integrand is continuous at θ=φ.\n\nBut how to phrase that? Maybe:\n\nThe integrand is continuous on [0, π/2] × [0, π/2].\n\nAlternatively, since the problem mentions it's well-defined around the singularity, perhaps:\n\nThe integrand has a removable singularity at θ = φ.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were simple and direct. So perhaps:\n\nThe integrand is well-defined at θ = φ.\n\nBut θ and φ are variables; when they approach each other, the function approaches a limit. So maybe:\n\nThe integrand is continuous for all θ, φ in [0, π/2].\n\nBut the problem specifically mentions θ=φ=0. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the problem states that the integrand is well-defined even around its singularity θ=φ=0. So the assumption here is that despite the apparent singularity, the integrand is defined. Therefore, the assumption would be:\n\nThe integrand is well-defined at θ = φ = 0.\n\nBut in the example, each assumption is about one object. So here, θ and φ are two separate variables, so each assumption would address one variable.\n\nWait, in the example, the assumptions were two separate lines about the same object (n): n is integer, n is divisible by 7. So here, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nθ is integrated over [0, π/2],\nφ is integrated over [0, π/2],\nThe integrand is well-defined at θ = φ.\n\nBut θ and φ are both integrated variables. The problem's integral is over both variables. The key points are the integration domains and the integrand's definition.\n\nI think the correct approach is to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. Here, the objects are θ and φ. Their domains are part of the integral, so the assumptions would be their integration intervals. Additionally, the integrand's well-definedness is another assumption.\n\nThus:\n\nAssumption:\nθ is in the interval [0, π/2],\nφ is in the interval [0, π/2],\nThe integrand is well-defined for all θ and φ in [0, π/2].\n\nProblem:\nProve that the double integral equals π ln2 as stated.\n\nThat should cover it. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", and the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, then adds \"n is divisible by 7\". But that's contradictory. Unless the example is incorrect. But regardless, following the user's instruction, the task is to extract the assumptions from the problem and list them line by line.\n\nIn the current problem, the assumptions from the problem are:\n\n1. θ ranges from 0 to π/2.\n2. φ ranges from 0 to π/2.\n3. The integrand is well-defined (even at θ=φ=0).\n\nSo each of these is a separate assumption.",
