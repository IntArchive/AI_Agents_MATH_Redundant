    "Content": "How can we show that if $R$ is an infinite commutative ring and $R/I$ is finite for every nonzero $I \\unlhd R$, then $R$ is an integral domain? I tried proceeding by contradiction: assume $a$,$b$ $\\in R \\backslash \\{0\\}$ and $ab=0$; then $R/(a)$ and $R/(b)$ must be finite, say $R/(a)=\\{k_i + (a) : 1 \\leq i \\leq m\\}$ and $R/(b)=\\{l_j + (b) : 1 \\leq j \\leq n\\}$. Does this mean $R$ must be finite? Or what about using the fact that $R/(a,b)$ finite? Thanks for any help with this!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If $ab=0$, and if $k_i$, $1\\leq i\\leq m$, are representatives mod $a$, then $(b)=\\{bk_1,\\dots,bk_m\\}$, i.e. $(b)$ is finite and hence $R/(b)$ infinite.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants to prove that an infinite commutative ring R with the property that every nonzero ideal I has a finite quotient ring R/I must be an integral domain. Hmm, integral domains don't have zero divisors, so maybe I need to show that R has no zero divisors. The user mentioned trying contradiction: assume there are non-zero a and b with ab=0. Then, R/(a) and R/(b) are finite. The user is wondering if this leads to R being finite or if using R/(a,b) helps.\n\nFirst, let's recall definitions. An integral domain is a commutative ring with no zero divisors. So if we can show that R has no zero divisors, we're done. Suppose for contradiction that there exist a, b ≠ 0 in R such that ab = 0. Then, (a) and (b) are nonzero ideals, so R/(a) and R/(b) are finite. Each coset of (a) is of the form k + (a), and similarly for (b). \n\nNow, since R is infinite, but R/(a) is finite, that means each coset k + (a) must be infinite. Similarly for R/(b). But how does this relate to ab=0? If ab=0, then b is in the annihilator of a. So, maybe the ideal (a,b) is relevant here. The user mentioned R/(a,b) being finite. Let's see. Since (a) and (b) are ideals, their sum (a,b) is also an ideal. If (a,b) is nonzero, then R/(a,b) must be finite. \n\nIf R/(a,b) is finite and both R/(a) and R/(b) are finite, can we deduce something about the size of R? Let's think about the natural ring homomorphisms from R to R/(a) and R/(b). The product of these homomorphisms gives a map from R to R/(a) × R/(b). The kernel of this map is (a) ∩ (b). If ab=0, then (a) ∩ (b) contains ab, but maybe more. Wait, if ab=0, then every multiple of ab is in both (a) and (b). But (a) ∩ (b) could be larger. However, in any case, the kernel is an ideal containing ab. But since R/(a) and R/(b) are finite, the image of this map is finite, so the kernel must have finite index in R. But the kernel is (a) ∩ (b), so R/( (a) ∩ (b) ) is finite. But R is infinite, so (a) ∩ (b) must be infinite? Wait, no. If R/( (a) ∩ (b) ) is finite and R is infinite, then (a) ∩ (b) itself must be infinite. But (a) and (b) are principal ideals, so their intersection is also an ideal. However, since R/(a) is finite, (a) has finite index, so (a) is infinite. Similarly, (b) is infinite. But their intersection being infinite... Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe look at the inclusion of (a) into R. Since R/(a) is finite, (a) has finite index, meaning (a) is infinite. Similarly for (b). Now, consider the product ab=0. Then, the set (a) * (b) is contained in (ab) = (0), so every product of elements from (a) and (b) is zero. But (a) and (b) are infinite, so R would have a lot of zero divisors. But how does that lead to a contradiction with R being infinite?\n\nWait, maybe use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. If (a) and (b) are comaximal ideals, then R/(ab) ≅ R/(a) × R/(b). But ab=0, so R/(ab) is just R. Then, R would be isomorphic to R/(a) × R/(b), which is finite. But R is infinite, so that's a contradiction. However, for the Chinese Remainder Theorem to apply, (a) and (b) need to be comaximal, i.e., (a)+(b)=R. But in our case, (a)+(b) is an ideal. Since R/(a)+(b) is finite (because (a)+(b) is a nonzero ideal, as a and b are nonzero and ab=0 implies neither a nor b is a unit if R is a domain, but R isn't a domain here). Wait, but if (a)+(b) = R, then R/(a)+(b) is trivial, which is finite. If (a)+(b) ≠ R, then since (a)+(b) is a nonzero ideal (as it contains a and b), then R/(a)+(b) must be finite. Either way, R/(a)+(b) is finite.\n\nBut if we have a surjective homomorphism from R to R/(a) × R/(b) with kernel (a) ∩ (b), then the image is isomorphic to R/( (a)+(b) ) × something? Maybe not. Alternatively, since R/(a) and R/(b) are finite, the product R/(a) × R/(b) is finite. The homomorphism from R to R/(a) × R/(b) has kernel (a) ∩ (b). So R/( (a) ∩ (b) ) injects into R/(a) × R/(b), hence is finite. Therefore, (a) ∩ (b) has finite index in R, making R finite, which contradicts R being infinite. Therefore, our initial assumption that there exist a and b nonzero with ab=0 must be false. Therefore, R is an integral domain.\n\nSo the key steps are: assuming existence of zero divisors leads to a finite ring, which contradicts R being infinite. Therefore, no zero divisors exist. \n\nNow, structuring the problem as per the format. The original problem is to show that if R is an infinite commutative ring where every nonzero ideal I has finite quotient R/I, then R is an integral domain. The assumptions would be:\n\n- R is an infinite commutative ring.\n- For every nonzero ideal I of R, the quotient ring R/I is finite.\n- The problem is to prove R is an integral domain.\n\nBut wait, the example given in the original user's example lists assumptions line by line, each addressing one property. So for this problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- R is a commutative ring.\n- R is infinite.\n- For every nonzero ideal I of R, the quotient ring R/I is finite.\n\nProblem: Prove that R is an integral domain.\n\nYes, that's the structure. The problem doesn't have any other hidden assumptions. The user's original problem mentioned trying contradiction by assuming a, b ≠0 with ab=0, leading to R/(a) and R/(b) being finite. Then considering R/(a,b). The key contradiction comes from the fact that if such a and b exist, then R would have to be finite, which contradicts R being infinite. Therefore, the assumptions are as above.",
