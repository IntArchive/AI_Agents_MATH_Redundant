    "Content": "Let $X$ be an infinite set of cardinality $|X|$ , and let $S$ be the set of all finite subsets of $X$ . How can we show that Card( $S$ ) $=|X|$ ? Can anyone help, please?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The cardinality is at least $|X|$, since $S$ contains all singletons. Let $S_n$ be the subset of $S$ consisting of all subsets of cardinality exactly $n$. Then $S$ is the disjoint union of the $S_n$. Now, for any positive integer $n$, the number of subsets of $X$ of cardinality $n$ is at most $|X|^n = |X|$ (equality since $|X|$ is infinite); because an $n$-tuple of elements of $X$ determines a subset of $X$ of cardinality at most $n$; and every subset with $n$ elements determines only finitely many distinct $n$-tuples of elements of $X$ (namely, $n!$). So $|S_n|\\leq n!|X|^n = |X|$ for all $n$. Therefore:\n\\begin{align*}\n|X| &\\leq |S| = \\left|\\bigcup_{n=0}^{\\infty} S_n\\right| = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}|S_n|\\\\\n&= \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}|S_n| \\leq \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}|X|\\\\\n&= \\aleph_0|X| = |X|,\n\\end{align*}\nwith the last equality since $|X|\\geq\\aleph_0$. Thus, $|X|\\leq |S|\\leq |X|$, so  $|S|=|X|$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem from the Math Stack Exchange question according to the given format. Let me start by understanding the original question.\n\nThe user is asking about the cardinality of the set S, which consists of all finite subsets of an infinite set X. They want to show that the cardinality of S is equal to the cardinality of X itself. \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The example given lists each assumption on a separate line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object. Let's parse the original question:\n\n- Let X be an infinite set. So the first assumption is that X is infinite.\n- The cardinality of X is |X|. Wait, that's just stating what |X| means, but maybe it's redundant. However, in the example, they mentioned \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, the key properties are that X is infinite and S is the set of all finite subsets of X. So maybe the assumptions should be:\n  1. X is an infinite set.\n  2. S is the set of all finite subsets of X.\n  3. The cardinality of X is |X|. Hmm, but maybe that's implicit. Wait, the problem statement says \"Let X be an infinite set of cardinality |X|\", so perhaps the cardinality is given as |X|. So I should list that as an assumption.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the user wrote \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So each assumption is a condition on the objects involved. Here, the main objects are X and S. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- X is an infinite set.\n- S is the set of all finite subsets of X.\n- The cardinality of X is |X|.\n\nWait, but \"cardinality of X is |X|\" is a bit tautological because |X| denotes the cardinality. Maybe the key point is that X is infinite, so its cardinality is some infinite cardinal. But perhaps in the problem, the user is just using |X| to denote its cardinality, so we can list that as an assumption. Alternatively, maybe we don't need to mention that because it's standard notation. But following the example, where they mention \"n is an integer\", perhaps here we need to state that X is an infinite set, and S is defined as the set of all finite subsets of X. The problem is to show that the cardinality of S equals the cardinality of X.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the original problem, but in the user's answer, the formatted problem included that as an assumption. Wait, no: looking at the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like maybe there was a mistake. Because the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7, but in the formatted problem, they added that as an assumption. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems wrong. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\", which is not in the original. That's probably a mistake in the example. So maybe the user made an error there. But regardless, following the instructions, when formatting, I need to filter unrelated information and structure the problem with its assumptions. So perhaps in that example, maybe the original problem actually had some hidden assumption, but perhaps the user made a mistake. Anyway, perhaps I should proceed.\n\nSo in the current problem, the original question is: Let X be an infinite set of cardinality |X|, and let S be the set of all finite subsets of X. Show that Card(S) = |X|.\n\nSo the assumptions here are:\n\n- X is an infinite set.\n- S is the set of all finite subsets of X.\n- The cardinality of X is |X|.\n\nBut perhaps the third is redundant because |X| is defined as the cardinality. But maybe in the context, it's important to note that X has cardinality |X|, which is an infinite cardinal. Alternatively, perhaps the key assumptions are just that X is infinite and S is the set of finite subsets. The problem is to show that Card(S) = |X|.\n\nSo structuring the problem accordingly:\n\nAssumption:\n- X is an infinite set.\n- S is the set of all finite subsets of X.\n\nProblem: Show that the cardinality of S is equal to |X|.\n\nWait, but in the example, they included redundant assumptions. Wait, in the example, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". However, the original problem doesn't mention divisibility by 7. So that example seems to have a mistake, possibly because the original problem may have had a typo or the user made an error. Therefore, perhaps I should focus on the current problem.\n\nThe user's problem is: Let X be an infinite set of cardinality |X|, S is the set of all finite subsets of X. Show Card(S) = |X|.\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n- X is an infinite set.\n- The cardinality of X is |X|. (This might be redundant since |X| is defined as the cardinality, but perhaps to state it explicitly.)\n- S is the set of all finite subsets of X.\n\nBut maybe the second assumption is not necessary. Alternatively, perhaps in the problem statement, X is given as an infinite set with cardinality |X|, so the key points are that X is infinite and S is the set of finite subsets. The problem is to show Card(S) = |X|.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- X is an infinite set.\n- S is the set of all finite subsets of X.\n\nProblem: Show that the cardinality of S is equal to |X|.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement already includes that X is infinite and has cardinality |X|, so the assumptions are:\n\n- X is an infinite set with cardinality |X|.\n- S is the set of all finite subsets of X.\n\nBut the example split the assumptions line by line. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nX is an infinite set,\nS is the set of all finite subsets of X,\nThe cardinality of X is |X|.\n\nBut the third line is redundant because |X| is the cardinality. So maybe just:\n\nAssumption:\nX is an infinite set,\nS is the set of all finite subsets of X.\n\nProblem: Show that the cardinality of S is equal to |X|.\n\nYes, because the problem states that X is an infinite set of cardinality |X|. So the first assumption is X is infinite, and the second is S is the set of finite subsets. The problem is to show Card(S) = |X|.\n\nSo I think that's the correct formatting.",
