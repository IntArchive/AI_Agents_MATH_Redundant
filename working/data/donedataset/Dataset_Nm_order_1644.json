    "Content": "I have seen that $x^{2}+x+1$ and $x^{4}+x+1$ are irreducible over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ and I thought a polynomial of the form $x^{2^m}+x+1$ for $m\\ge3$ would be irreducible too. However using WolframAlpha, my hunch was wrong. It could be factored over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. WolframAlpha could only generate the factors for $m=3,\\ldots, 13$ and so far, I observed that for odd $m$, my polynomial is divisible by $x^{2}+x+1$. I want to see how one can show that $x^{2^m}+x+1$ for $m\\ge3$ is reducible.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I will write $\\mathbb F_2$ rather than $\\mathbb Z_2$ ; here the $\\mathbb F$ stands for \"finite field\" and the subscript is the number of elements in the finite field.  This notation is convenient when one wants to consider larger finite fields, as I will in this answer. The polynomial $x^2 + x + 1$ splits in the field $\\mathbb F_4$ with $4$ elements; its two roots are the two elements of $\\mathbb F_4$ that aren't in $\\mathbb F_2$ .\nNow if $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb F_4$ then $\\alpha^4 = \\alpha$ .  Thus if $n = 2 m + 1 $ is odd, we have that $$\\alpha^{2^{2m + 1}} = (\\alpha^{4^m})^2 = \\alpha^2,$$ and so $$\\alpha^{2^{2m+1}} + \\alpha + 1 = 0.$$ Consequently each of the two roots of $x^2 + x + 1$ is also a root of $x^{2^{2m+1}} + x + 1$ as well, which explains why $x^2 + x + 1$ divides $x^{2^{2m + 1}} + x + 1.$ To handle the general case of $x^{2^n} + x + 1$ (i.e. the case when $n$ is not necessarily odd) it helps to recall some Galois theory for finite fields.  The key fact is that if $\\alpha$ lies in any finite extension field of $\\mathbb F_2$ ,\nnamely some $\\mathbb F_{2^f}$ for some $f \\geq 1$ , then the algebraic conjugates of $\\alpha$ are all of the form $\\alpha, \\alpha^2,\\alpha^4, \\ldots.$ (This list will be finite, because --- assuming I chose $f$ minimally --- then $\\alpha^{2^{f-1}} \\neq \\alpha,$ but $\\alpha^{2^f} = \\alpha$ , and so $\\alpha$ has exactly $f$ distinct conjugates over $\\mathbb F_2$ .) Now suppose that $\\alpha$ satisfies $$\\alpha^{2^n} + \\alpha + 1 = 0.$$ Adding $\\alpha + 1$ to both sides (and remembering that $ 1 = - 1$ because we are in characteristic $2$ ) we find that $$\\alpha^{2^n} = \\alpha+1.$$ Hence $$\\alpha^{2^{2n}} = (\\alpha^{2^n})^{2^n} = (\\alpha + 1)^{2^n}\n= \\alpha^{2^n} + 1 = (\\alpha +1)+1 = \\alpha$$ (using the facts that $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + b^2$ and $1 + 1 = 0$ , which both hold in characteristic $2$ ). So we see that the \" $f$ \" for $\\alpha$ is at most $2n$ , i.e. $\\alpha$ has at most $2n$ distinct algebraic conjugates over $\\mathbb F_2$ , and so its minimal polynomial over $\\mathbb F_2$ has degree at most $2n$ .  Since $\\alpha$ is a root of $x^{2^n} + x + 1$ , this minimal polynomial divides $x^{2^n} + x + 1$ .\nIf $n \\geq 3$ , then $2n$ is strictly less than $2^n$ , and so this minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ also\nhas degree strictly less than that of $x^{2^n} + x + 1$ . Thus when $n \\geq 3,$ the polynomial $x^{2^n} + x + 1$ must be reducible.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original question is about the reducibility of the polynomial \\( x^{2^m} + x + 1 \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\) for \\( m \\geq 3 \\), noting that it seems to factor for odd \\( m \\) by \\( x^2 + x + 1 \\). \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The problem mentions that \\( x^2 + x + 1 \\) and \\( x^4 + x + 1 \\) are irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\). The user thought that polynomials of the form \\( x^{2^m} + x + 1 \\) for \\( m \\geq 3 \\) would also be irreducible, but WolframAlpha shows they're reducible, especially noticing that for odd \\( m \\), the polynomial is divisible by \\( x^2 + x + 1 \\). \n\nAssumptions should list each condition applied to one object. So:\n\n1. The polynomial \\( x^2 + x + 1 \\) is irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\).\n2. The polynomial \\( x^4 + x + 1 \\) is irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\).\n3. \\( m \\) is an integer where \\( m \\geq 3 \\).\n4. For odd \\( m \\), the polynomial \\( x^{2^m} + x + 1 \\) is divisible by \\( x^2 + x + 1 \\).\n\nWait, but the original problem says that the user observed that for odd \\( m \\), the polynomial is divisible by \\( x^2 + x + 1 \\). However, the actual problem is to show that \\( x^{2^m} + x + 1 \\) is reducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\) for \\( m \\geq 3 \\). So perhaps the assumptions are the irreducibility of the lower-degree polynomials and the user's observations, but the problem itself is to prove reducibility.\n\nBut according to the example provided, the assumptions are the given conditions. So in the original problem, the user states that they saw \\( x^2 + x +1 \\) and \\( x^4 + x +1 \\) are irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\). Then, they thought that \\( x^{2^m} +x +1 \\) would be irreducible for \\( m \\geq 3 \\), but found it's reducible. They observed that for odd \\( m \\), it's divisible by \\( x^2 +x +1 \\). The problem is to show that \\( x^{2^m} +x +1 \\) is reducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\) for \\( m \\geq 3 \\).\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- \\( x^2 + x + 1 \\) is irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\).\n- \\( x^4 + x + 1 \\) is irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\).\n- \\( m \\) is an integer with \\( m \\geq 3 \\).\n- For odd integers \\( m \\geq 3 \\), the polynomial \\( x^{2^m} + x + 1 \\) is divisible by \\( x^2 + x + 1 \\).\n\nBut wait, the original problem's user says that their hunch was wrong, and they observed that for odd \\( m \\), the polynomial is divisible by \\( x^2 +x +1 \\). However, in the problem statement, they want to show that \\( x^{2^m} +x +1 \\) is reducible for \\( m \\geq 3 \\). So perhaps the assumptions are the given conditions (the irreducibility of the lower ones and the observation about divisibility), but the problem is to show reducibility. However, in the example, the assumption included that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the original problem's statement. Here, the user's observation might not be an assumption but part of their exploration. So perhaps the key assumptions are:\n\n- The polynomials \\( x^2 + x +1 \\) and \\( x^4 +x +1 \\) are irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\).\n- \\( m \\) is an integer with \\( m \\geq 3 \\).\n\nBut the problem is to show reducibility of \\( x^{2^m} +x +1 \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\) for \\( m \\geq 3 \\). The user's observation about divisibility by \\( x^2 +x +1 \\) when \\( m \\) is odd is part of their analysis, but perhaps not an assumption. So the problem is to show reducibility for all \\( m \\geq 3 \\), regardless of parity. However, the user mentions that WolframAlpha shows it's reducible for m from 3 to 13, and their observation is that for odd m, it's divisible by x^2 +x +1. So maybe the problem as posed by the user is to show that x^{2^m} +x +1 is reducible over Z2 for m >=3, and how to show that. The assumptions would include that m is an integer >=3. The original problem's user also mentions that their initial thought was it's irreducible, but they found it's reducible. The key points to extract are:\n\nAssumptions:\n- \\( x^2 + x + 1 \\) is irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\).\n- \\( x^4 + x + 1 \\) is irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\).\n- \\( m \\) is an integer with \\( m \\geq 3 \\).\n\nProblem:\nShow that the polynomial \\( x^{2^m} + x + 1 \\) is reducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\) for \\( m \\geq 3 \\).\n\nBut wait, the user also mentions that for odd m, the polynomial is divisible by x^2 +x +1. That might be part of the problem's conditions. However, the user's observation is not part of the problem's inherent assumptions. The problem is to show reducibility. So perhaps the assumptions are only:\n\n- \\( m \\) is an integer with \\( m \\geq 3 \\).\n\nBut the user refers to the irreducibility of x^2 +x +1 and x^4 +x +1 as given, which might be part of the context but not the problem's assumptions. However, according to the example, assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. In the example, the original problem states that n is an integer, but the formatted problem includes \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which was not in the original. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n. But in the formatted problem, it's listed as assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, but that seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should be that n is an integer, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. However, in the example, the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which is not in the original. That suggests perhaps a mistake in the example. Wait, let me check:\n\nOriginal problem in the example: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems contradictory. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That's incorrect. The example might have been a wrong example provided by the user, but perhaps the user intended that the formatted problem's assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. Wait, maybe the original problem had a mistake, but the user's example is structured that way. So following the user's example, even if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem includes \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which was not in the original. So perhaps the user's example is incorrect, but we need to follow their format.\n\nGiven that, perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- \\( x^2 + x + 1 \\) is irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\).\n- \\( x^4 + x + 1 \\) is irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\).\n- \\( m \\geq 3 \\).\n- For odd \\( m \\), the polynomial \\( x^{2^m} +x +1 \\) is divisible by \\( x^2 + x +1 \\).\n\nBut the original problem states that the user observed this divisibility, but the actual problem is to show reducibility for \\( m \\geq 3 \\). So perhaps the assumptions are the irreducibility of the lower-degree polynomials and the given m condition. However, the example seems to include both the general condition (n is integer) and a specific one (n divisible by 7). Wait, perhaps the example is wrong. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut that's inconsistent because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which doesn't restrict n to multiples of 7. The formatted problem's assumptions add an extra condition. Maybe the example is wrong, but the user wants us to follow their structure regardless. So perhaps in the current problem, the user's observation that for odd m, the polynomial is divisible by x^2 +x +1 is part of the assumptions, but the actual problem is to show reducibility for m >=3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to show reducibility for m >=3, with the given context that x^2 +x +1 and x^4 +x +1 are irreducible, but those are known facts, not assumptions. However, the example included \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption even though the original problem didn't state that, which suggests that perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user wants to extract all conditions from the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem statement, and the problem is the question being asked. In the example, perhaps the original problem had a mistake, but the user structured it as such. For the current problem, the user mentions that x^2 +x +1 and x^4 +x +1 are irreducible over Z2, which is a given fact. The problem is to show that x^{2^m} +x +1 is reducible for m >=3. Therefore, the assumptions should include:\n\n- \\( x^2 + x +1 \\) is irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\).\n- \\( x^4 + x +1 \\) is irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\).\n- \\( m \\) is an integer with \\( m \\geq 3 \\).\n\nProblem: Show that the polynomial \\( x^{2^m} +x +1 \\) is reducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\) for \\( m \\geq 3 \\).\n\nAdditionally, the user's observation about divisibility by x^2 +x +1 for odd m might be part of their exploration but not part of the problem's assumptions. So perhaps the assumptions are the first two about the lower-degree polynomials being irreducible and m >=3.\n\nHowever, the example might suggest that any conditions mentioned in the problem statement, even if they are known facts, should be listed as assumptions. For example, in the original example, the problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is \"n is an integer\". Then the problem's formatted version adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which wasn't in the original problem. That seems like a mistake, but perhaps the user wants to include all conditions, even if they are part of the problem's statement. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a typo, and the example is correct.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, but following the user's example, where they added \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", it's possible that in the current problem, the assumptions include:\n\n- \\( x^2 + x +1 \\) is irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\).\n- \\( x^4 + x +1 \\) is irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\).\n- \\( m \\) is an integer with \\( m \\geq 3 \\).\n- For odd \\( m \\), \\( x^{2^m} +x +1 \\) is divisible by \\( x^2 +x +1 \\).\n\nBut the user's observation about divisibility for odd m is part of their analysis, not an assumption given in the problem. The problem is to show reducibility for all m >=3. Therefore, perhaps the correct assumptions are:\n\n- \\( m \\) is an integer with \\( m \\geq 3 \\).\n\nProblem: Show that the polynomial \\( x^{2^m} +x +1 \\) is reducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\).\n\nBut the example included other conditions from the problem statement as assumptions, like the divisibility by 7. However, since the user's example might be flawed, I need to decide based on the instructions. The task says to \"filter the unrelated information and structure the problem as the format\". The example seems to list the conditions given in the problem, even if they are part of the problem's premise. So in the current problem, the user mentions that x^2 +x +1 and x^4 +x +1 are irreducible over Z2, which is a known fact, but perhaps in the context of the problem, these are given as premises. Therefore, the assumptions should include these irreducibility statements and the condition on m.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The polynomial \\( x^2 + x + 1 \\) is irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\).\n- The polynomial \\( x^4 + x + 1 \\) is irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\).\n- \\( m \\) is an integer with \\( m \\geq 3 \\).\n\nProblem:\nShow that the polynomial \\( x^{2^m} +x +1 \\) is reducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\).\n\nAlternatively, the original problem's user states that they observed for odd m, the polynomial is divisible by x^2 +x +1. This might be an additional observation but not an assumption. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions are only the irreducibility of the lower-degree polynomials and m >=3. However, the problem is to show reducibility, which doesn't depend on m's parity. But the user's observation suggests a possible approach for odd m, but the problem is to show reducibility for all m >=3, which may include even m as well.\n\nBut in the original problem, the user says that using WolframAlpha, they saw that for m=3,...,13, the polynomial factors, and for odd m, it's divisible by x^2 +x +1. They want to know how to show reducibility in general. So the problem is to show that for any m >=3, the polynomial is reducible over Z2, which may have different proofs depending on whether m is odd or even. But the formatted problem should capture the essential assumptions and the problem.\n\nHence, the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- \\( m \\) is an integer with \\( m \\geq 3 \\).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the polynomial \\( x^{2^m} + x + 1 \\) is reducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\).\n\nBut the original problem mentions the irreducibility of the lower-degree polynomials. Should those be included as assumptions? In the example, the original problem didn't state that 91 is 7×13, but the formatted problem didn't include that. The example included assumptions that were not in the original problem. Wait, the example's original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem includes \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" But this is conflicting because the original problem's statement is for every integer n, but the formatted problem adds an extra condition. This suggests that perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user wants to follow it regardless.\n\nGiven the confusion, but to adhere to the example's structure, where the assumptions list all conditions mentioned (even if they are part of the problem's premise), in the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The polynomial \\( x^2 + x + 1 \\) is irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\).\n- The polynomial \\( x^4 + x + 1 \\) is irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\).\n- \\( m \\) is an integer with \\( m \\geq 3 \\).\n- For odd integers \\( m \\geq 3 \\), the polynomial \\( x^{2^m} + x + 1 \\) is divisible by \\( x^2 + x + 1 \\).\n\nProblem:\nShow that the polynomial \\( x^{2^m} + x + 1 \\) is reducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\) for \\( m \\geq 3 \\).\n\nHowever, the fourth assumption is actually the user's observation, not a given condition. The problem is to prove reducibility, and the user is noting that for odd m, divisibility by x^2 +x +1 is a factor. But since the example included conditions that were not in the original problem, perhaps the correct approach is to list as assumptions the given premises (the irreducibility of the lower polynomials and m >=3), and the problem is to show reducibility.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The polynomial \\( x^2 + x + 1 \\) is irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\).\n- The polynomial \\( x^4 + x + 1 \\) is irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\).\n- \\( m \\) is an integer with \\( m \\geq 3 \\).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the polynomial \\( x^{2^m} + x + 1 \\) is reducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\).\n\nBut the original problem's user mentions their observation about odd m, which might be a clue for the proof but not an assumption. However, according to the example, even if the original problem states something like \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem includes \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So following that, the assumptions here would include that m is an integer >=3 and the irreducibility of the two lower-degree polynomials.\n\nThus, the correct answer should list those assumptions and the problem as stated.",
