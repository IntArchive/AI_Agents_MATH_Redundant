    "Content": "Let $ABC$ be a triangle with a point $D$ inside.  Suppose that $\\angle BAD=114^\\circ$ , $\\angle  DAC=6^\\circ$ , $\\angle ACD=12^\\circ$ and $\\angle DCB=18^\\circ$ .  Show that $$\\frac{BD}{AB}=\\sqrt2.$$ I am requesting a geometric proof (with as little trigonometry as possible). A completely geometric proof would be most appreciated.  I have a trigonometric proof below. Trigonometric Proof Wlog, let $AB=1$ .  Note that $\\angle ABC=\\angle ACB=30^\\circ$ , so $AC=1$ .  Then by law of sines on $\\triangle ACD$ , $$AD=\\frac{\\sin 12^\\circ}{\\sin 18^\\circ}.$$ By law of cosines on $\\triangle ABD$ , $$BD^2=1^2+\\frac{\\sin^212^\\circ}{\\sin^2{18^\\circ}}-2\\frac{\\sin 12^\\circ}{\\sin 18^\\circ}\\cos 114^\\circ.$$ As $\\cos 114^\\circ=-\\sin24^\\circ$ , we get $$BD^2=2+\\frac{-\\sin^218^\\circ+\\sin^212^\\circ+2\\sin12^\\circ\\sin18^\\circ\\sin 24^\\circ}{\\sin^218^\\circ}.$$ Then from the identities $\\sin^2\\alpha-\\sin^2\\beta=\\sin(\\alpha-\\beta)\\sin(\\alpha+\\beta)$ and $\\sin(2\\alpha)=2\\sin\\alpha\\cos\\alpha$ , we have $$BD^2=2+\\frac{-\\sin 6^\\circ\\sin 30^\\circ+4\\sin 6^\\circ\\cos 6^\\circ \\sin 18^\\circ\\sin24^\\circ}{\\sin^218^\\circ}.$$ Because $\\sin 30^\\circ=\\frac12$ , we conclude that $BD=\\sqrt{2}$ if we can prove $$8\\cos 6^\\circ \\sin 18^\\circ \\sin 24^\\circ=1.$$ This is true because by the identity $2\\sin\\alpha\\cos\\beta=\\sin({\\alpha+\\beta})+\\sin(\\alpha-\\beta)$ , we have $$2\\sin 24^\\circ \\cos 6^\\circ =\\sin 30^\\circ+\\sin 18^\\circ.$$ Since $\\sin 30^\\circ=\\frac12$ , we obtain $$8\\cos 6^\\circ \\sin 18^\\circ \\sin 24^\\circ =2\\sin 18^\\circ +4\\sin^218^\\circ=1,$$ noting that $\\sin 18^\\circ=\\frac{\\sqrt5-1}{4}$ . Attempt at Geometric Proof I discovered something that might be useful.  Construct  the points $E$ and $G$ outside $\\triangle ABC$ so that $\\triangle EBA$ and $\\triangle GAC$ are similar to $\\triangle ABC$ (see the figure below).  Clearly, $EAG$ is a straight line parallel to $BC$ .  Let $F$ and $H$ be the points corresponding to $D$ in $\\triangle EBA$ and $\\triangle GAC$ , respectively (that is, $\\angle FAB=\\angle DCB=\\angle HCA$ and $\\angle FAE=\\angle DCA=\\angle HCG$ ). Then $\\triangle FBD$ and $\\triangle HDC$ are isosceles triangles similar to $\\triangle ABC$ , and $\\square AFDH$ is a parallelogram.  I haven't been able to do anything further than this without trigonometry. Here is a bit more attempt.  If $M$ is the reflection of $A$ wrt $BC$ , then through the use of trigonometric version of Ceva's thm, I can prove that $\\angle AMD=42^\\circ$ and $\\angle CMD=18^\\circ$ .  Not sure how to prove this with just geometry.  But this result may be useful.  (Although we can use law of sines on $\\triangle MCD$ to get $MD$ and then use law of cosines on $\\triangle BMD$ to get $BD$ in terms of $AB$ too.  But this is still a heavily trigonometric solution, even if the algebra is less complicated than the one I wrote above.) I have a few more observations.  They may be useless.  Let $D'$ be the point obtained by reflecting $D$ across the perpendicular bisector of $BC$ .  Draw a regular pentagon $ADKK'D'$ .  Geogebra tells me that $\\angle ABK=54^\\circ$ and $\\angle AKB=48^\\circ$ .  This can be proven using trigonometry, although a geometric proof should exist.  But it is easy to show that $KD\\perp CD$ and $K'D'\\perp BD'$ . In all of my attempts, I always ended up with one of the following two trigonometric identities: $$\\cos 6^\\circ \\sin 18^\\circ \\sin 24^\\circ=1/8,$$ $$\\cos 36^\\circ-\\sin18^\\circ =1/2.$$ (Of course these identities are equivalent.)  I think a geometric proof will need an appearance of a regular pentagon and probably an equilateral triangle, and maybe a square.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $\\omega$ , $O$ be the circumcircle and circumcenter of $\\triangle ABC$ , respectively. Let $P,Q,R,S$ be four points on the shorter arc $AC$ of $\\omega$ dividing this arc into five equal parts. First, we shall prove that $\\triangle RSD$ is equilateral. Let $D'$ be a point inside $\\omega$ such that $\\triangle RSD'$ is equilateral. Also, let $E$ be inside $\\omega$ such that $\\triangle PQE$ is equilateral. Invoking symmetries we see that $\\triangle D'SC \\equiv \\triangle D'RQ \\equiv \\triangle EQR \\equiv \\triangle EPA$ . Note that $\\angle EQR = \\angle QRD'=\\angle QRS-60^\\circ = 168^\\circ - 60^\\circ = 108^\\circ$ . Hence $\\angle D'QR = 90^\\circ - \\frac 12\\angle QRD' = 36^\\circ$ and $\\angle EQD'=108^\\circ - 36^\\circ = 72^\\circ$ . But also $\\angle D'EQ = 180^\\circ - \\angle EQR = 180^\\circ - 108^\\circ = 72^\\circ$ . Hence $ED'Q$ is isosceles with $QD'=ED'$ . Again, using symmetries we see that $AED'C$ is an isosceles trapezoid with $AE=ED'=D'C$ . We have $\\angle ACD'=\\angle SCD' - \\angle SCA = 36^\\circ - 24^\\circ = 12^\\circ$ . Since $AED'C$ is an isosceles trapezoid, it is cyclic and since $AE=ED'=D'C$ , it follows that $\\angle D'AC = \\frac 12 \\angle EAC = \\frac 12 \\angle ACD'=6^\\circ$ . Hence $D'$ coincides with $D$ . Now comes my favourite part. Some angle chasing shows that $\\angle QCE = 18^\\circ = \\angle DCB$ and $\\angle DQC = 24^\\circ = \\angle BQE$ . Hence $D$ and $E$ are isogonal conjugates in $\\triangle BQC$ . It follows that $\\angle CBD = \\angle EBQ$ . Choose $T$ on $\\omega$ so that $BT$ is a diameter. Clearly, $\\triangle BQE$ is symmetric to $\\triangle TRD$ with respect to perpendicular bisector of $QR$ . In particular, $\\angle RTD = \\angle EBQ$ . Let $RT$ intersect $BC$ at $X$ . Since $\\angle CBD = \\angle EBQ = \\angle RTD$ , quadrilateral $BDXT$ is cyclic. Hence $\\angle BDT = \\angle BXT$ . Then some angle chasing shows that $\\angle DOB = 102^\\circ = \\angle BXT = \\angle BDT$ . This precisely means that the circumcircle of $DOT$ is tangent to $BD$ at $D$ . Tangent-secant theorem yields $BD^2=BO\\cdot BT = BO \\cdot 2BO = 2BO^2$ . Hence $$\\frac{BD}{AB} = \\frac{BD}{BO} = \\sqrt 2,$$ as desired.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse the original question and extract the necessary assumptions and the problem statement as per the specified format. \n\nThe problem is about triangle ABC with a point D inside it. The given angles are: angle BAD is 114 degrees, angle DAC is 6 degrees, angle ACD is 12 degrees, and angle DCB is 18 degrees. The goal is to show that the ratio BD/AB is equal to the square root of 2, using as little trigonometry as possible and preferably a completely geometric proof.\n\nStarting with the assumptions, each should be a single condition applied to one object. Let's list them:\n\n1. Triangle ABC exists with point D inside it.\n2. The measure of angle BAD is 114 degrees.\n3. The measure of angle DAC is 6 degrees.\n4. The measure of angle ACD is 12 degrees.\n5. The measure of angle DCB is 18 degrees.\n\nNow, I need to make sure these are all the necessary assumptions. The original problem mentions that the user has a trigonometric proof but wants a geometric one. The problem statement itself is to show BD/AB = sqrt(2). The example provided in the user's instruction had an assumption about n being an integer and divisible by 7, so here the assumptions are the given angles and the existence of the triangle and point D.\n\nWait, the problem statement in the example included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the original problem but perhaps not all the given conditions. Here, the original problem gives several angle measures. The user might have included some redundant information, but according to the instruction, we need to filter out unrelated information. However, in this case, all the angle measures provided are directly part of the problem's conditions. The user also mentions that ABC is a triangle with D inside, so those are necessary.\n\nLooking at the example, the assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property. So here, each angle condition is a separate assumption. Also, since the problem states \"Show that BD/AB = sqrt(2)\", the problem statement is straightforward.\n\nSo, the formatted problem should list each angle as a separate assumption. The problem is to show the ratio BD/AB equals sqrt(2). The user also mentions that ABC is a triangle with D inside, which is an assumption. So the assumptions are:\n\n- Triangle ABC has a point D inside it.\n- Angle BAD measures 114 degrees.\n- Angle DAC measures 6 degrees.\n- Angle ACD measures 12 degrees.\n- Angle DCB measures 18 degrees.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption, each applied to one object. Now, I need to check if there are any other implicit assumptions. For instance, the problem might be assuming ABC is a certain type of triangle, but the user's trigonometric proof mentions that angle ABC and angle ACB are both 30 degrees. Wait, in the trigonometric proof, the user says \"Note that angle ABC = angle ACB = 30 degrees, so AC = 1.\" Wait, that's part of the user's solution, not the original problem's given. So the original problem doesn't state that ABC is isoceles with base angles 30 degrees. That must be derived from the given angles. Wait, but how? Let me check again.\n\nWait, the original problem's title says: \"ABC be a triangle with a point D inside. Suppose that angle BAD=114°, angle DAC=6°, angle ACD=12°, and angle DCB=18°.\" Then the problem is to show BD/AB = sqrt(2). The user's trigonometric proof starts by assuming wlog AB = 1, and then states that angle ABC = angle ACB = 30°, hence AC = 1. That suggests that in the problem, triangle ABC must be isoceles with AB = AC and base angles 30°. But is that given? Wait, how does that come from the original problem's conditions?\n\nLet me reconstruct the angles. Let's consider triangle ABC with point D inside. The angles at A are split into BAD = 114° and DAC = 6°, so angle BAC is 114° + 6° = 120°. Then, angle ACD is 12°, which is angle at C between AC and CD, and angle DCB is 18°, which is angle at C between CD and CB. Therefore, angle ACB is 12° + 18° = 30°. Similarly, angle ABC can be found if we know the other angles. Since in a triangle, angles sum to 180°, angle ABC = 180° - angle BAC - angle ACB = 180° - 120° - 30° = 30°. Therefore, triangle ABC is isoceles with AB = AC because angles at B and C are both 30°. Therefore, the fact that ABC is isoceles with AB = AC is a consequence of the given angles, not an assumption. Therefore, in the original problem, the user didn't mention that ABC is isoceles; that is derived from the given angles. Therefore, in the assumptions, we shouldn't include AB = AC or angles at B and C being 30°, because those are derived from the given angles. Therefore, the assumptions are only the given angles and the existence of D inside ABC.\n\nTherefore, the problem's assumptions are:\n\n- D is a point inside triangle ABC.\n- Angle BAD = 114°.\n- Angle DAC = 6°.\n- Angle ACD = 12°.\n- Angle DCB = 18°.\n\nAnd the problem is to show that BD/AB = sqrt(2).\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list each angle as separate assumptions, and the problem statement. The example given by the user had in the assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7, each on a separate line. Similarly, here each angle condition is a separate line. Therefore, the formatted problem should be as follows.",
