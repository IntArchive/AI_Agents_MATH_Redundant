    "Content": "Various examinations ask students to prove that $$\\frac{1}{{n \\choose k}}=(n+1) \\int_{0}^{1} x^k (1-x)^{n-k} dx ~~~~~(1)$$ by evaluating  the integral $\\int_{0}^{1}\n(tx+1-x)^n~dt$ two ways. When I came across (1), I could prove that $$\\sum_{k=0}^{n}\\frac{(-1)^k}{{n\\choose k}}=[1+(-1)^n] \\frac{n+1}{n+2}.~~~~(2)$$ as below: $$S_n=\\frac{1}{n+1}\\sum_{k=0}^{n}\\frac{(-1)^k}{{n\\choose k}}=\\int_{0}^1 \\sum_{k=0}^{n} (-1)^k  x^k (1-x)^{n-k} dx =  \\int_{0}^{1}  (1-x)^n \\sum_{k=0}^{n}\\left(\\frac{-x}{1-x} \\right)^k dx =\\int_{0}^{1}(1-x)^n \\frac{ \\left( \\frac{-x}{1-x}\\right)^{n+1}-1}{\\left(\\frac{-x}{1-x}\\right)-1}dx$$ $$=\\int_{0}^{1}[(1-x)^{n+1}-(-x)^{n+1}] dx =\\frac{1+(-1)^n}{n+2}.~~~~(3)$$ Therefore, $$S_{2m+1}=0 ~~~~(4) ~~~ \\mbox{and}~~~ S_{2m}= \\frac{2m+1}{m+1}.~~~~(5)$$ Now the question is: Can one prove (2) in some other way(s)?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows how assumptions and the problem are separated. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The title is about proving a summation involving binomial coefficients and alternating signs. The user mentioned equation (2) as the target to prove using other methods. \n\nLooking at the assumptions, in the example, they listed each condition on the variables. Here, the problem involves a sum over k from 0 to n, with terms (-1)^k divided by the binomial coefficient. The conclusion is that this sum equals [1 + (-1)^n] times (n+1)/(n+2). \n\nI need to extract all assumptions. The problem seems to assume n is an integer because it's a summation from 0 to n, which is standard in combinatorics. Also, the binomial coefficient {n \\choose k} implies n and k are non-negative integers with k ≤ n. But in the problem statement, are there any specific conditions on n? The original question doesn't mention any restrictions, but the integral formula (1) might be valid for certain n. Wait, equation (1) is given as 1 over the binomial coefficient equals (n+1) times the integral from 0 to 1 of x^k (1-x)^{n-k} dx. That formula is generally valid for n and k being non-negative integers. So the assumptions here would be that n is a non-negative integer, and k ranges from 0 to n as per the summation. But since the problem is to prove equation (2), the main assumption is that n is a non-negative integer.\n\nBut wait, in the example provided by the user, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is general for all n, so maybe the only assumption is that n is a non-negative integer. However, in the original problem, the user didn't specify any restrictions, but the equations involve binomial coefficients, which require n to be a non-negative integer. So the key assumption here is that n is a non-negative integer. \n\nTherefore, the assumptions section should list that n is a non-negative integer. Are there other assumptions? The problem statement doesn't specify any further conditions. The original proof uses integrals and generating functions, but the problem is to find another proof. The problem itself is to prove the given summation equals the expression with [1 + (-1)^n] times (n+1)/(n+2). \n\nSo the formatted problem should have an assumption that n is a non-negative integer. Let me check the example again. In the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, since the problem is about binomial coefficients, n must be a non-negative integer. So the assumption is n is a non-negative integer. \n\nNow, the problem statement is exactly as given in equation (2). The user wants to know if there's another way to prove that the sum equals [1 + (-1)^n] * (n+1)/(n+2). So the problem is to prove that equation, given the assumption that n is a non-negative integer. \n\nWait, but does the original question have any other hidden assumptions? For example, the integral formula (1) might require n and k to be non-negative integers. Since the summation is over k from 0 to n, n must be a non-negative integer. So the key assumption is that n is a non-negative integer. \n\nSo putting it all together: the assumption is n is a non-negative integer. The problem is to prove the given summation equals the specified expression. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption: \nn is a non-negative integer.\n\nProblem: \nProve that $$\\sum_{k=0}^{n}\\frac{(-1)^k}{{n\\choose k}}=[1+(-1)^n] \\frac{n+1}{n+2}.$$",
