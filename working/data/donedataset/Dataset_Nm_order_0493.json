    "Content": "Here's a statement from Lam's First Course in Noncommutative Rings . (Paraphrased) Let $k$ be a field. Then the following conditions are equivalent. $$(\\forall a,b,c,d\\in k)\\;\\;(a,b,c,d)\\neq 0\\implies a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2\\neq 0;\\tag 1$$ $$-1\\text{ is not a sum of two squares.}\\tag2$$ I can't prove this fact. If I replace $(2)$ with $$-1\\text{ is not a sum of three squares,}\\tag3$$ then the equivalence between $(1)$ and $(3)$ is easy to prove. Indeed, suppose $(1)$ is false. Then we may assume without loss of generality that there are $a,b,c,d\\in k$ with $a\\neq 0$ such that $$a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2=0.$$ But then $$-1=\\left(\\frac ba\\right)^2+\\left(\\frac ca\\right)^2+\\left(\\frac da\\right)^2,$$ and so $(3)$ is false. Conversely, if $(3)$ is false, then there exist $x,y,z\\in k$ such that $$-1=x^2+y^2+z^2$$ and therefore $$0=x^2+y^2+z^2+1^2,$$ which means that $(1)$ is false. I can also prove $(1)\\implies (2).$ Suppose $(2)$ is false. Then $$-1=x^2+y^2,$$ whence $$0=x^2+y^2+1^2+0^2,$$ which implies that $(1)$ is false. But I can't prove $(2)\\implies (1)$ and I'm starting to suspect that it may actually be false. But I can't find a counterexample either. It would require finding a field in which $-1$ is a sum of three squares but not a sum of two squares. But in finite fields, every element is a sum of two squares, as proven here . In the subfields of $\\mathbb R$ on the other hand, $-1$ is not a sum of three squares. And in $\\mathbb C,$ it is a sum of two squares: $-1=0^2+i^2.$ In general, an example cannot be algebraically closed, which leaves me with the fields of rational functions as the only other fields I know. Also, the example cannot have characteristic $2$ as then $-1=1=1^2+0^2.$ Edit: The theorem Gerry Myerson cites in his answer is proven here . A Wikipedia article on the Stufe is here . Both links have been given by joriki in the comments.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Hint $\\ $ If $\\rm\\: -1 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2\\:$ then either $\\rm\\:c^2 = -1\\:$ or $\\rm\\:(a^2+b^2)/(c^2+1) = -1,\\:$ which may be rewritten as a sum of two squares, since such sums $\\ne 0$  form a group , using Brahmagupta for  multiplication, and inversion via $\\rm\\ 0\\ne z = x^2\\! + y^2\\:$ $\\Rightarrow$ $\\rm\\:1/z = (x/z)^2 + (y/z)^2.$ Remark $\\ $ The proof generalizes. Replacing the Brahmagupta composition identity by identities discovered by Pfister for quadratic forms in $\\rm\\:2^n\\:$ variables, the proof shows that if $-1$ is a sum of $\\rm\\:m\\:$ squares in a field, then the least value of $\\rm\\:m\\:$ is necessarily a power of $2$, which is called the level ( Stufe in German) of the field. Further, every power of $2$ is the level of some field.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me first understand the original problem.\n\nThe question is about proving an equivalence between two statements in an arbitrary field k. The two conditions are:\n\n1. For all a, b, c, d in k, if (a, b, c, d) ≠ 0, then a² + b² + c² + d² ≠ 0.\n2. -1 is not a sum of two squares in k.\n\nThe user is struggling to prove that (2) implies (1). They suspect it might be false but can't find a counterexample. They mention that replacing (2) with -1 not being a sum of three squares makes the equivalence easier to prove. They also discuss various fields like finite fields, subfields of ℝ, ℂ, and characteristics 2, and mention needing a field where -1 is a sum of three squares but not two.\n\nMy task is to extract assumptions and the problem statement. The example given in the user's instruction lists each assumption line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. Let's parse the problem.\n\nThe problem is in an arbitrary field k. The two conditions are given. The user wants to know if -1 being a sum of two squares is equivalent to condition (1). The original question's title is asking if -1 is a sum of two squares iff it's a sum of three squares, but the actual problem in the question is about the equivalence between condition (1) and (2).\n\nSo, the assumptions would relate to the properties of the field k and the conditions given. Let's see:\n\n1. The field k is arbitrary (from the title and the problem statement).\n2. For all a, b, c, d in k, (a, b, c, d) ≠ 0 implies a² + b² + c² + d² ≠ 0 (condition 1).\n3. -1 is not a sum of two squares in k (condition 2).\n\nBut the problem is to show the equivalence between these two conditions. However, the user is specifically stuck on proving (2) implies (1). So perhaps the problem as structured should be to prove that in an arbitrary field k, conditions (1) and (2) are equivalent. But the user is asking whether this is true, given their difficulty in proving (2)⇒(1).\n\nWait, the original title is \"Is it true in an arbitrary field that −1 is a sum of two squares iff it is a sum of three squares?\" But the problem inside the question is about the equivalence between (1) and (2). Let me re-read the question carefully.\n\nThe user cites Lam's book, stating that in a field k, the following are equivalent:\n\n(1) For all a, b, c, d in k, (a, b, c, d) ≠ 0 ⇒ a² + b² + c² + d² ≠ 0.\n\n(2) -1 is not a sum of two squares.\n\nThe user can prove (1) implies (2) and (3) implies (1), where (3) is -1 not being a sum of three squares, but can't prove (2) implies (1). They suspect it might be false but can't find a counterexample.\n\nSo the problem they want to present is whether in an arbitrary field, (1) and (2) are equivalent. However, the user's own work shows that (1) ⇔ (3), and (1) ⇒ (2), but (2) ⇒ (1) is in question.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the formatted problem should list assumptions and the problem. The original problem from Lam's book is to show the equivalence of (1) and (2). The user is questioning whether this is true because they can't prove (2)⇒(1). So the problem as per the user is: Prove or disprove that in a field k, conditions (1) and (2) are equivalent.\n\nBut the original problem in the question is structured as \"Is it true in an arbitrary field that −1 is a sum of two squares iff it is a sum of three squares?\" Wait, no. The title is different from the actual problem. The title is about -1 being a sum of two vs three squares, but the body is about equivalence between (1) and (2), where (1) is the non-vanishing of four squares, and (2) is -1 not being a sum of two squares.\n\nBut the user's own rephrasing might be mixing two things. Wait, let me check again.\n\nThe user starts by paraphrasing Lam's statement: Let k be a field. Then the following are equivalent.\n\n(1) For all a, b, c, d in k, (a,b,c,d) ≠ 0 ⇒ a² + b² + c² + d² ≠ 0.\n\n(2) -1 is not a sum of two squares.\n\nThe user can't prove this equivalence. They can prove (1) implies (2) and (3) implies (1), where (3) is -1 not a sum of three squares. But (2) implies (1) is problematic.\n\nSo the problem as per the user's question is: Prove that in any field k, (1) and (2) are equivalent. But the user is stuck on (2)⇒(1).\n\nHowever, in the example provided by the user, the original problem was to prove a statement, and the formatted problem lists the assumptions and the problem. So in this case, the assumptions would be the properties of the field and the conditions given. But since the problem is about equivalence between two conditions, maybe the assumptions are that we are working in an arbitrary field, and the problem is to prove the equivalence.\n\nBut according to the user's example, each assumption addresses one property or condition applied to one object. For the example given, the assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Then the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nIn the current problem, the main assumptions would be:\n\n- k is a field.\n\nBut the problem is to prove equivalence between (1) and (2). However, in the user's example, they included the assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the problem's conditions. But here, the problem is about the equivalence of two statements in any field. So perhaps the only assumption is that k is a field.\n\nBut the user's question is whether in an arbitrary field, the two conditions (1) and (2) are equivalent. So the problem is to prove or disprove that in any field k, conditions (1) and (2) are equivalent.\n\nBut the user's own analysis suggests that maybe (2) does not imply (1), but they can't find a counterexample. So perhaps the problem is to determine whether (2) implies (1) in any field k.\n\nBut following the example format, the assumptions should list all the conditions given in the problem. Since the problem is about equivalence of (1) and (2) in an arbitrary field, the assumptions would be:\n\n- k is a field.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that (1) and (2) are equivalent.\n\nBut the user's original question also mentions that they can prove (1)⇒(2) and (3)⇒(1), but not (2)⇒(1). So maybe the problem as structured should focus on the part they can't prove.\n\nAlternatively, since the user is asking whether the equivalence holds, the problem is whether in an arbitrary field k, (1) and (2) are equivalent.\n\nBut to fit the format, perhaps:\n\nAssumptions:\n- k is a field.\n- For all non-zero a, b, c, d in k, a² + b² + c² + d² ≠ 0.\n- -1 is not a sum of two squares in k.\n\nProblem: Prove that the above two conditions are equivalent.\n\nBut wait, the original problem is to show that these two conditions are equivalent. So the problem is to prove the equivalence, but the user is stuck on one direction.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to prove equivalence, perhaps the assumptions are the field properties, and the problem is to show equivalence between (1) and (2).\n\nBut in the user's example, the assumptions were the specific conditions given (n is an integer, n divisible by 7). So here, the problem is about an arbitrary field, so the main assumption is that k is a field. Then the problem is to prove that (1) and (2) are equivalent.\n\nBut in the user's question, they might have additional assumptions they're considering, like characteristic ≠2, but the original problem doesn't specify. However, the user mentions that in characteristic 2, -1=1, so it's a square. But the original problem's statement from Lam's book probably doesn't exclude any characteristic, so the field is arbitrary.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nk is a field.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the following conditions are equivalent:\n1. For all a, b, c, d in k, if (a, b, c, d) ≠ 0, then a² + b² + c² + d² ≠ 0.\n2. -1 is not a sum of two squares in k.\n\nBut the user's example had each assumption as a separate line. However, here, the problem is about the equivalence in any field. So the assumption is just that k is a field. But maybe in the problem statement, the two conditions are part of the problem, not assumptions.\n\nWait, looking back at the example:\n\nOriginal problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem listed assumptions as n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Then the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut in that case, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer (since it's for every integer n), but in the formatted problem, they added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem in the example lists assumptions as n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that seems incorrect because the original problem didn't have the divisibility by 7 as a condition. Wait, the original problem was:\n\n\"Prove that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\"\n\nBut in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. That suggests maybe there was a mistake in the example. Wait, perhaps the user made an error in their example. Because the original problem is for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, they added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7, which changes the problem. That seems incorrect. The original problem's assumption is just that n is an integer, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. But in the formatted example, they added n divisible by 7, which would make the problem different. So perhaps the user's example is flawed, but we have to follow their format regardless.\n\nGiven that, perhaps in the current problem, we need to list all assumptions, each as one line. The original problem is about an arbitrary field k, so the assumption is that k is a field. Then the problem is to prove the equivalence between (1) and (2).\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to prove equivalence between two conditions, maybe the assumptions are the properties of the field, and the problem is the equivalence. But since the problem is about any field, perhaps the assumption is simply that k is a field.\n\nTherefore, following the example (even if flawed), the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nk is a field.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the following are equivalent:\n1. For all non-zero a, b, c, d in k, a² + b² + c² + d² ≠ 0.\n2. -1 is not a sum of two squares in k.\n\nBut the user's example split assumptions into separate lines. If we need to follow that strictly, then each assumption is one line. However, in this case, the main assumption is that k is a field. The problem is to prove equivalence of (1) and (2).\n\nAlternatively, if the original problem's conditions (1) and (2) are part of the problem statement, not assumptions, then the only assumption is that k is a field. But the user's example included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was not in the original problem. So maybe the user's example is incorrect, but we have to follow their format.\n\nWait, the original example's original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem lists assumptions as n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. So the formatted problem seems to have added an extra assumption not present in the original problem, which changes the problem. That suggests that maybe the user made a mistake in their example. However, the current task is to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the format, following the user's example.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the user's example is wrong, but we have to proceed. The user's example added an assumption (n divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem, thus altering the problem. Therefore, perhaps when structuring, we need to list all the conditions given in the problem as assumptions, each on a separate line.\n\nLooking at the current problem: the question is about proving the equivalence between (1) and (2) in an arbitrary field k. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- k is a field.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that (1) and (2) are equivalent.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to show equivalence, maybe the assumptions are the two conditions, but that doesn't make sense. The user's example listed the assumptions as the conditions given on the variables in the problem.\n\nBut perhaps in this case, since the problem is about any field k, the only assumption is that k is a field. Then the problem is to prove the equivalence between (1) and (2).\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is to show that (1) implies (2) and vice versa, then each direction might have different assumptions. But according to the user's example, assumptions are listed once, and the problem is stated.\n\nGiven the user's example, even if flawed, we need to follow. In the example, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That suggests that maybe the user intended to filter out unrelated information and list the actual assumptions needed. However, that's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's example is incorrect, but we should focus on the current problem.\n\nThe problem from the user's question is: In an arbitrary field k, are the following conditions equivalent?\n\n(1) All non-zero quadruples (a,b,c,d) have a² + b² + c² + d² ≠ 0.\n\n(2) -1 is not a sum of two squares.\n\nThe user is asking whether this equivalence holds, as they can't prove (2)⇒(1).\n\nTherefore, structuring this into the format:\n\nAssumption: Each assumption would be properties of the field k. Since the problem is about arbitrary fields, the only assumption is that k is a field. However, the problem is to prove the equivalence, so the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. Wait, but the conditions (1) and (2) are what's to be proven equivalent, so they aren't assumptions.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. The user's example seems to have added an assumption not present in the original problem. Maybe the correct approach is to list the main objects involved and their properties.\n\nIn the current problem, the main object is the field k. The assumptions are that k is a field. The problem is to prove the equivalence of (1) and (2).\n\nTherefore:\n\nAssumption:\nk is a field.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the following conditions are equivalent:\n1. For all non-zero quadruples (a, b, c, d) in k, a² + b² + c² + d² ≠ 0.\n2. -1 is not a sum of two squares in k.\n\nBut the user's example included two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. The original problem was for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, it's under the assumption that n is divisible by 7, which changes the problem. So perhaps the user intended to extract hidden assumptions or conditions from the problem. However, in the current problem, the only assumption is that k is a field. The conditions (1) and (2) are part of the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nk is a field.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the following are equivalent:\n1. For all a, b, c, d ∈ k, if (a, b, c, d) ≠ 0, then a² + b² + c² + d² ≠ 0.\n2. -1 is not a sum of two squares in k.\n\nAlternatively, if we need to split assumptions into individual lines, but since the only assumption is that k is a field, that's one line. However, the user's example had two assumptions for their problem. But in this case, there's only one assumption: k is a field.\n\nThus, the final answer should follow the format with assumption as \"k is a field\" and the problem as the equivalence.",
