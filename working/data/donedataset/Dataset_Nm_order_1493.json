    "Content": "Suppose that $f$ and $g$ are uniformly continuous functions defined on $(a,b)$. Prove that $fg$ is also uniformly continuous on $(a,b)$. My attempt: Since $f$ is uniformly continuous on $(a,b)$, for all $\\epsilon>0$, we have $\\delta_f(\\epsilon)>0$ such that for all $x,y \\in (a,b)$, $|x-y|<\\delta_f$, $|f(x)-f(y)|<\\epsilon$ Since $g$ is uniformly continuous on $(a,b)$, for all $\\epsilon>0$, we have $\\delta_g(\\epsilon)>0$ such that for all $x,y \\in (a,b)$, $|x-y|<\\delta_g$, $|g(x)-g(y)|<\\epsilon$ Notice that $$|f(x)g(x)-f(y)g(y)|=|f(x)g(x)-f(x)g(y)+f(x)g(y)-f(y)g(y)| \\leq |f(x)||g(x)-g(y)| + |g(y)||f(x)-f(y)|$$ Here I don't know how to bound $|f(x)|$ and $|g(y)|$. I have proven that uniformly continuous functions preserve boundedness of an interval , i.e. $f$ is bounded on $(a,b)$. Can anyone help me?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "There is a nice way: Hint: Try to show that if f, g are Uniformly continuous, so are $f \\pm g$ and $f^2$. Then observe that $fg = 0.5((f+g)^2 - f^2 -g^2)$. Hope this helps.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question according to the specified structure. Let me start by understanding the original question and the example provided.\n\nThe original problem is about proving that the product of two uniformly continuous functions on an interval (a, b) is also uniformly continuous. The user tried to use the definition of uniform continuity and decomposed the difference |f(x)g(x) - f(y)g(y)| into two parts using the triangle inequality. However, they got stuck because they need to bound |f(x)| and |g(y)|, and they mentioned that uniformly continuous functions on (a, b) are bounded. \n\nIn the example given, the assumption part lists each condition applied to one object. For the problem here, the key assumptions are that both f and g are uniformly continuous functions defined on (a, b). The problem statement is to prove that their product fg is uniformly continuous on (a, b). \n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is listed line by line, addressing only one property or condition per line. So, the two main assumptions here are that f is uniformly continuous on (a, b) and g is uniformly continuous on (a, b). The problem is to prove the product is uniformly continuous. \n\nWait, the user also mentioned that they proved uniformly continuous functions on (a, b) are bounded. But in the problem statement, do we need to include that as an assumption? No, because that's a property they derived from the given conditions. The original problem doesn't state that f and g are bounded; that's a consequence of being uniformly continuous on a bounded interval. So in the assumptions, we only list what's given in the problem, not the derived properties. Therefore, the assumptions should just be the uniform continuity of f and g on (a, b).\n\nI should check the example again. In the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like maybe there was a mistake? Wait, no, looking back, the example's original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps the example was incorrect? Or maybe the user made a typo. Wait, the original example's formatted problem says:\n\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nBut the original problem was stated as \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like an error. Because the original problem didn't have that restriction. Maybe the example was incorrect? Hmm, but the user provided that as their example. So perhaps the user intended to show how to structure even if there's a mistake. Anyway, I need to focus on the current problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's original question states that f and g are uniformly continuous on (a, b), and the task is to prove fg is uniformly continuous. The assumptions are that f and g are each uniformly continuous. So in the formatted problem, the assumptions should list each function's uniform continuity separately. So:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a uniformly continuous function on (a, b),\ng is a uniformly continuous function on (a, b).\n\nProblem:\nProve that fg is uniformly continuous on (a, b).\n\nThat's the core. The user's attempt also mentions that they proved uniformly continuous functions on (a, b) are bounded. But that's part of the solution, not part of the problem's assumptions. So we don't include boundedness in the assumptions because it's a derived property, not given.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have two assumptions, each stating the uniform continuity of f and g on the interval, and the problem is to prove the product is uniformly continuous.",
