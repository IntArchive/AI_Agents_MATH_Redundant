    "Content": "Browsing around online, I find a handful of proofs that $3$ is always a primitive root of any Fermat prime $2^n+1$. One particular proof is found in problems 4 and 5 here . Another proof I found on a page at SUNYSB makes use of Pepin's test whose proof seems to require quadratic reciprocity. So out of curiosity, is it possible to prove that any Fermat prime has $3$ as a primitive root without use of quadratic reciprocity? The few observations I do know is that if $2^n+1$ is prime for $n\\gt 1$, then $n$ is actually a power of $2$, and that in this case $U(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})$ has order $2^n$, so the order of $3$ must also be a power of $2$, but I couldn't get much further than that.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $n$ denote the number $2^{2^{n'}}+1$, $g$ be a primitive root modulo $n$, and let $n(a)$ denote the order of $a$ modulo $n$, for an integer $a$.  Since $a^{n(a)}\\equiv g^{n-1} \\pmod{n}$, if $n$ is a prime, $a\\equiv g^{(n-1)/n(a)} \\pmod{n}$; hence $a$ is a quadratic residue modulo $n$ if, and only if, (n-1)/n(a) is even.  Take for $n$ the number $2^{2^{n'}}+1$, we see that $a$ is a quadratic residue modulo $n$ if and only if $a$ is not a primitive root modulo $n$. As $2^{2^{n'}}+1\\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, for every $n'$>1, $n$ is of the form $3x+2$.  If 3 is a quadratic residue modulo $n$, however, $n$ must divide a number of the form $x^2-3y^2$, hence $\\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, which is obviously a contradiction.  Therefore 3 is not a quadratic residue modulo $n$, thus 3 is a primitive root modulo $n$. Please forgive me for some typing error. Thanks in any case for paying attention.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to structure the Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe original question is about proving that 3 is a primitive root modulo any Fermat prime without using quadratic reciprocity. The user mentions Fermat primes, which are primes of the form 2^(2^k) + 1. The problem statement is in the title: \"Is it possible to prove that 3 is a primitive root of any Fermat prime without quadratic reciprocity?\"\n\nNow, looking for assumptions. The key points here are:\n\n1. The Fermat prime is of the form 2^(2^k) + 1. So the assumption is that p is a Fermat prime, which inherently means p = 2^(2^k) + 1 for some non-negative integer k. But the original question doesn't specify k's range, just mentions \"any Fermat prime\". However, Fermat primes are known to be primes of that form, so the assumption would be that p is a Fermat prime.\n\n2. The problem is about 3 being a primitive root modulo p. So another assumption is that 3 is considered as an element of the multiplicative group modulo p.\n\nBut the user also mentions in their explanation that if 2^n +1 is prime for n>1, then n is a power of 2. So perhaps the assumption that p is a Fermat prime already includes that it's of the form 2^(2^k) +1.\n\nWait, the problem statement is about \"any Fermat prime\", which is defined as a prime of the form 2^(2^k) +1. So the assumption is that p is a Fermat prime. So in the assumptions, I need to list that p is a Fermat prime, which implies p = 2^(2^k) +1 for some integer k ≥ 0. But in the example given by the user, assumptions are listed as separate lines, each addressing one property applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\np is a Fermat prime,\n3 is an integer,\nThe multiplicative group modulo p has order 2^(2^k).\n\nWait, but the multiplicative group modulo a prime p has order p-1. For a Fermat prime p = 2^(2^k) +1, then p-1 = 2^(2^k). So the order is 2^(2^k), which is a power of 2. The problem is to show that 3 is a primitive root, i.e., its order is equal to p-1 = 2^(2^k). The user also mentions that the order of 3 must be a power of 2, which is already given because the group order is a power of 2.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- p is a Fermat prime (so p = 2^(2^k) +1 for some integer k ≥ 0).\n- The multiplicative group modulo p has order 2^(2^k).\n\nBut perhaps more precisely, since the problem is about 3 being a primitive root, the key assumptions are that p is a Fermat prime, and 3 is considered as an element of the multiplicative group modulo p.\n\nHowever, the original problem doesn't state any additional conditions on p except being a Fermat prime. The user's own observations note that if 2^n +1 is prime for n >1, then n is a power of 2. But in the problem statement, it's given that p is a Fermat prime, so that's already accounted for.\n\nSo, to structure the problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- p is a Fermat prime.\n- The multiplicative group modulo p has order 2^(2^k).\n\nProblem: Prove that 3 is a primitive root modulo p without using quadratic reciprocity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the multiplicative group order is part of the definition of a Fermat prime, so perhaps the first assumption is sufficient. Wait, the multiplicative group modulo p has order p-1, which for a Fermat prime p = 2^(2^k) +1, p-1 = 2^(2^k). So that's inherent in p being a Fermat prime. Therefore, maybe the only assumption needed is that p is a Fermat prime. The problem then is to prove that 3 is a primitive root modulo p without quadratic reciprocity.\n\nBut the user's own observations also mention that the order of 3 must be a power of 2, which is a consequence of the group order being a power of 2. So perhaps that's part of the given when p is a Fermat prime. But in the example provided by the user, the assumptions list each condition. For instance, in the example, the original problem had n divisible by 7 as an assumption, but in the formatted problem, they split it into two assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nSo following that pattern, for this problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- p is a Fermat prime (i.e., p = 2^(2^k) +1 for some integer k ≥ 0),\n- The multiplicative group modulo p has order 2^(2^k),\n- 3 is an integer not divisible by p.\n\nWait, but 3 and p are primes. Since p is a Fermat prime, which is greater than 3 (except for p=3, but 3 is not a Fermat prime because Fermat primes are 2^(2^k)+1. The smallest Fermat primes are 3 (k=0: 2^(2^0)+1=3), 5 (k=1), 17 (k=2), etc. So 3 is a Fermat prime when k=0. But the problem states \"any Fermat prime\", including 3. Wait, but 3 is indeed a Fermat prime (when k=0). However, 3 divides 3, so 3 would not be a primitive root modulo 3 because the multiplicative group modulo 3 has order 2, and 3 mod 3 is 0, which is not in the group. Therefore, the problem might need to exclude p=3, but the user's original question doesn't mention that. Wait, the original question says \"any Fermat prime\", but if p=3, then 3 can't be a primitive root. So perhaps there's an error here, but maybe the original question assumes p is a Fermat prime greater than 3? Or maybe the user made a mistake. However, according to the standard knowledge, 3 is a primitive root modulo the Fermat primes 5, 17, 257, 65537. But for p=3, since 3 ≡0 mod 3, it's invalid. So perhaps the problem should exclude p=3. But the user's original question says \"any Fermat prime\", which includes p=3. This might be an oversight, but since the user is asking the question, maybe we have to follow their phrasing.\n\nHowever, in the problem as posed on Math Stack Exchange, the user is asking whether it's possible to prove that 3 is a primitive root of any Fermat prime without quadratic reciprocity. The linked proof uses Pepin's test, which is for testing the primality of Fermat numbers. Pepin's test states that for n ≥1, the Fermat number F_n = 2^(2^n)+1 is prime if and only if 3^( (F_n -1)/2 ) ≡ -1 mod F_n. So if F_n is prime, then 3 is a quadratic non-residue modulo F_n, and since the multiplicative order must divide 2^(2^n), which is F_n -1, then the order of 3 would be F_n -1, making it a primitive root. However, this relies on quadratic reciprocity to establish 3 as a quadratic non-residue.\n\nThe user wants to know if there's a proof without using quadratic reciprocity. The existing answer might involve showing that 3 has the correct order by other means, perhaps using lifting the exponent or other lemmas. But back to formatting.\n\nThe problem is to prove that 3 is a primitive root modulo any Fermat prime without using quadratic reciprocity. The assumptions needed are that p is a Fermat prime (so p=2^(2^k)+1 for some k ≥0), and that 3 is not congruent to 0 modulo p (which is true as long as p >3, but for p=3, 3≡0 mod 3, so 3 isn't in the multiplicative group. Hence, perhaps p is a Fermat prime greater than 3. But the original question didn't specify, so perhaps we have to include p=3 as a Fermat prime, but that case is trivial because there's no primitive root modulo 3 since 3 isn't in the group. Therefore, perhaps the original question implicitly assumes p is a Fermat prime where 3 is a primitive root, but that's circular. Alternatively, maybe the original problem is intended for Fermat primes where p>3, but the user didn't state that. Since the user's own observations mention that when p=2^n +1 is prime for n>1, then n is a power of 2, which would exclude p=3 (since 3=2^1 +1, but n=1 is allowed). Therefore, the user might be including p=3. However, in that case, 3 mod 3 is 0, which is not a primitive root. Therefore, there's a mistake in the problem statement. But since the user is quoting the original question, which says \"any Fermat prime\", perhaps we should proceed as given, but note that for p=3, the statement is false. However, since the user is asking for the structure, we have to follow their question as is.\n\nThus, structuring the problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- p is a Fermat prime (i.e., p = 2^{2^k} + 1 for some integer k ≥ 0),\n- The multiplicative group modulo p has order 2^{2^k},\n- 3 is not divisible by p.\n\nProblem: Prove that 3 is a primitive root modulo p without using quadratic reciprocity.\n\nBut wait, the third assumption \"3 is not divisible by p\" is redundant because if p is a Fermat prime, then p=2^{2^k}+1. For k=0, p=3, which divides 3. For k≥1, p=5,17, etc., which do not divide 3. Therefore, the assumption \"3 is not divisible by p\" would exclude p=3. But since the original problem includes \"any Fermat prime\", which includes p=3, but in that case, 3 is not in the multiplicative group. So there's a problem here. Perhaps the correct assumption is that p is a Fermat prime with p ≠3. But the original question doesn't state that. This seems like a contradiction in the problem as posed. However, since the user's own observations mention that if 2^n +1 is prime for n>1, then n is a power of 2. This suggests that the user is considering n>1, which would make p=2^{2^k}+1 where k ≥1, thus p ≥5, avoiding the p=3 case. Therefore, perhaps the assumption is p is a Fermat prime with k ≥1, hence p ≥5. But the original problem statement doesn't specify this. Therefore, I need to make a judgment call here.\n\nIn the example provided, the user included assumptions that were perhaps not all explicitly stated in the original problem. For instance, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that's because the original problem had a mistake, and the user corrected it. Wait, looking back at the example:\n\nOriginal problem says: Prove that for every integer $n$, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". So the user must have realized that the original problem's statement was incorrect as written, and added the assumption that n is divisible by 7 to make it correct. So perhaps in that case, the user is filtering the problem and correcting it. Therefore, in this current task, when structuring the problem, I need to filter unrelated information and possibly correct the problem's assumptions if necessary.\n\nBut in the current case, the original problem is asking whether it's possible to prove that 3 is a primitive root of any Fermat prime without quadratic reciprocity. The problem as stated includes p=3, which is invalid. Therefore, to structure the problem correctly, we should note that p is a Fermat prime greater than 3. But how to phrase that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original question implicitly excludes p=3. For example, when the user says \"any Fermat prime\", they might not be considering p=3. Because in the context of primitive roots, 3 cannot be a primitive root modulo 3. Therefore, the problem likely intends p to be a Fermat prime greater than 3. So the assumption would be:\n\n- p is a Fermat prime greater than 3 (i.e., p = 2^{2^k} +1 for some integer k ≥1).\n\nAlternatively, since Fermat primes are primes of the form 2^{2^k} +1, and the known Fermat primes are 3,5,17,257,65537. So p=3 is a Fermat prime, but 3 cannot be a primitive root modulo 3. Therefore, the problem's statement is incorrect as written. However, the user is asking whether it's possible to prove that 3 is a primitive root of any Fermat prime without quadratic reciprocity, which is likely intended for Fermat primes where this holds, i.e., p=5,17, etc. Therefore, the assumption should exclude p=3.\n\nBut how to determine that from the original question? The user's own observations mention that if 2^n +1 is prime for n>1, then n is a power of 2. This suggests that they are considering n>1, leading to p=5,17, etc. Hence, the assumption would be p is a Fermat prime with p=2^{2^k} +1 where k ≥1 (so p ≥5). Therefore, the correct assumptions would be:\n\nAssumptions:\n- p is a Fermat prime of the form p = 2^{2^k} +1 for some integer k ≥1,\n- The multiplicative group modulo p has order 2^{2^k}.\n\nProblem: Prove that 3 is a primitive root modulo p without using quadratic reciprocity.\n\nAlternatively, since the multiplicative group's order is p-1 = 2^{2^k}, which is inherent in p being a Fermat prime, the first assumption covers that. Therefore, perhaps:\n\nAssumptions:\n- p is a Fermat prime of the form p = 2^{2^k} +1 for some integer k ≥1.\n\nProblem: Prove that 3 is a primitive root modulo p without using quadratic reciprocity.\n\nThis seems sufficient. The key points are that p is a Fermat prime (excluding p=3 if k=0), and the problem is to show 3 is a primitive root modulo p without QR.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have the assumption that p is a Fermat prime (which for k ≥1 gives p ≥5), and the problem statement as given.",
