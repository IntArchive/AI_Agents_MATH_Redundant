    "Content": "A question says: Using the isomorphism theorems or otherwise, prove that a subgroup of a finitely generated abelian group is finitely generated. I would say that for a finitely generated abelian group $G$, there exists elements $g_1,\\dots, g_n$ such that a linear combination of them generates the whole group. Therefore as every element of a subgroup has an element in $G$ and so can be made by a linear combination of $g_1,\\dots, g_n$. This means that $g_1,\\dots, g_n$ span the whole subgroup and so there exists a subset of $g_1,\\dots, g_n$ which generates the subgroup. This answer seems far too 'linear algebra-ish' rather than 'group theory-ish' and I can't seem to see how one would use the isomorphism theorems? Help would be appreciated!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This follows from the following theorem, which is a common ingredient in the proof of the structure theorem for finitely generated abelian groups: Theorem. Let $r\\gt 0$ be a positive integer, and let $H$ be a subgroup of $\\mathbb{Z}^r$ . Then there exists a basis $a_1,\\ldots,a_r$ of $\\mathbb{Z}^r$ , an integer $d$ , $0\\leq d\\leq r$ , and positive integers $m_1,\\ldots,m_d$ such that $m_1|m_2$ , $m_2|m_3,\\ldots,m_{d-1}|m_d$ such that $m_1a_1,\\ldots,m_da_d$ is a basis for $H$ . In particular, $H$ is free and finitely generated. You can see a proof of this in this previous answer . To see how this proves the result, suppose that $G$ is abelian and finitely generated by $g_1,\\ldots,g_r$ . Let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$ . There is a surjection $\\mathbb{Z}^r\\to G$ given by mapping the standard basis vector $\\mathbf{e}_i$ to $g_i$ ; the subgroup $H$ corresponds to a subgroup $\\mathcal{H}$ of $\\mathbb{Z}^r$ by the isomorphism theorems. By the Theorem, $\\mathcal{H}$ is finitely generated, and hence its image, $H$ , is also finitely generated (generated by the images of the generators of $\\mathcal{H}$ ).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is asking about proving that a subgroup of a finitely generated abelian group is itself finitely generated. They mention using the isomorphism theorems or otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the key assumptions here. The main objects involved are the finitely generated abelian group and its subgroup. So, the primary assumption is that the group G is abelian and finitely generated. Then, the subgroup in question is just a subgroup of G, but the problem states that this subgroup is to be proven finitely generated. \n\nThe user also mentions using isomorphism theorems, which suggests that the proof should involve those theorems rather than, say, a linear algebra approach. The user’s initial attempt was more linear algebra-based, using generating sets, but they feel it's not group-theoretic enough. So maybe the correct approach involves applying the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups or one of the isomorphism theorems like the first or second.\n\nWait, the fundamental theorem classifies finitely generated abelian groups into direct products of cyclic groups. If we can use that theorem, then a subgroup of such a group would also be a product of cyclic groups, hence finitely generated. But the user wants to use isomorphism theorems. Alternatively, perhaps induction on the number of generators? For example, if G is generated by n elements, then any subgroup H can be generated by n elements? But that doesn't sound right; in free abelian groups, subgroups of rank n can have higher rank, but finitely generated abelian groups can have torsion which complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the fact that finitely generated abelian groups are Noetherian? Wait, but abelian groups are modules over Z, and Z is Noetherian, so finitely generated modules over Noetherian rings are Noetherian, meaning all submodules are finitely generated. But that's module theory, not directly using isomorphism theorems. The user might want a proof within group theory.\n\nAnother approach: Since G is finitely generated abelian, it's isomorphic to Z^r × T, where T is the torsion subgroup (finite). Then, any subgroup H would be isomorphic to a subgroup of Z^r × T. The subgroup H would then project to a subgroup of Z^r, which is free abelian of finite rank, hence finitely generated, and the kernel would be in T, hence finite. Then, by the structure theorem, H is finitely generated. But again, that uses the structure theorem rather than isomorphism theorems.\n\nAlternatively, think of the generators of G. Let G be generated by g1,...,gn. Take a subgroup H. For each generator gi, consider the intersection H with the cyclic subgroup generated by gi. But H might not be generated by these intersections. Not sure.\n\nThe user mentions the isomorphism theorems. Maybe consider the quotient group G/H? But G/H is not necessarily finitely generated unless H is finitely generated, which is what we need to prove. Wait, that's circular.\n\nWait, perhaps using the fact that if G is finitely generated and abelian, then any subgroup H is the kernel of a homomorphism from G to some group. But homomorphisms from G to where? If G is finitely generated, then the image is finitely generated. But I don't see how that helps with H being finitely generated.\n\nAlternatively, use induction on the number of generators. Suppose G is generated by one element. Then G is cyclic, and any subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic, hence finitely generated. Assume true for groups generated by n-1 elements. For a group generated by n elements, write G = ⟨g1,...,gn⟩. Let H be a subgroup. Consider the projection π: G → G/⟨g1⟩. Then H/(H ∩ ⟨g1⟩) is isomorphic to a subgroup of G/⟨g1⟩, which is generated by n-1 elements. By induction, H/(H ∩ ⟨g1⟩) is finitely generated. Since H ∩ ⟨g1⟩ is cyclic (as a subgroup of a cyclic group), hence finitely generated. Then H is an extension of a finitely generated group by a finitely generated group, hence finitely generated. This uses the second isomorphism theorem (H/(H ∩ ⟨g1⟩) ≅ ⟨g1⟩H/⟨g1⟩). So maybe that's the approach using isomorphism theorems. \n\nBut the user's problem is to structure the original question into assumptions and problem. The original question is to prove that a subgroup of a finitely generated abelian group is finitely generated. The assumptions would be that G is a finitely generated abelian group and H is a subgroup of G. Then the problem is to prove H is finitely generated. The user also mentions using isomorphism theorems, but that's part of the approach, not the problem statement. So the formatted problem would list the assumptions about G and H, then the problem to prove H is finitely generated.\n\nBut in the example given by the user, the original problem had an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) but in the example, the assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, the original problem in the example said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps the original example had a different problem. Let me check.\n\nIn the example, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem's assumptions include \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like a mistake. Wait, perhaps the original problem was different. Maybe the user made an error in the example? Wait, maybe the original problem had a condition that n is divisible by 7, but the user wrote \"for every integer n\". That would be a mistake.\n\nBut in any case, for the current problem, the main assumptions are:\n\n- G is a finitely generated abelian group.\n\n- H is a subgroup of G.\n\nThe problem is to prove that H is finitely generated.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\nG is a finitely generated abelian group,\n\nH is a subgroup of G.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that H is finitely generated.\n\nBut the original question's title is \"Proving that a subgroup of a finitely generated abelian group is finitely generated\", which matches this.\n\nThe user's own attempt was trying to use generating sets and linear combinations, but that's more like a vector space approach. The user is asking for a method using isomorphism theorems instead.\n\nBut in the formatting task, the assistant is supposed to extract the assumptions and problem. The assumptions are the given conditions. In the original problem, the only given is that G is a finitely generated abelian group and H is a subgroup. So those are the assumptions.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\nG is a finitely generated abelian group,\n\nH is a subgroup of G.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that H is finitely generated.",
