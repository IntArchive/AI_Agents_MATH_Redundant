    "Content": "I am stuck for weeks with the following problem: Let $A$ and $x$ be $n \\times n$ and $n \\times 1$ matrices, respectively, with all entries real and strictly positive. Assume that $A^2 x = x$. Show that $A x = x$. This was on the first problem set on a course of linear algebra based on the book written by Hoffman & Kunze. We haven't seen eigenvalues and eigenvectors yet. So, while any solution that uses anything more advanced than the first 3 chapters of that book is welcome (it may incentivize me to study something!), it does not solve the problem. Can anyone help? Thanks! EDIT: My question was marked as a exact duplicate of a question by Igor Caetano Diniz. While that is the exact same question, that post has one wrong answer and one answer that has a theorem that I haven't studied yet. So it doesn't solve my problem.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The Perron-Frobenius Theorem says, among others, the following: A square matrix $A$ with strictly positive entries has a positive eigenvalue $\\rho$ and corresponding eigenvector $y$ with strictly positive entries. All other eigenvalues of $A$ are strictly smaller in absolute value, and the corresponding eigenvectors do not have all positive entries. In the situation at hand we are given a matrix $A$ with positive entries. Let $\\rho$ and $y$ be as in the theorem. The matrix $A^2$ has positive entries as well, and $y$ is an eigenvector of $A^2$ with corresponding eigenvalue $\\rho^2$. Since we are told that the all-positive vector $x$ is an eigenvector of $A^2$ with corresponding eigenvalue $1$, it follows from the uniqueness part of the theorem that in fact $\\rho^2=1$ and $x=\\lambda y$ for a $\\lambda>0$. This allows to conclude that $Ax=x$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to structure the given problem into the specified format, separating assumptions and the problem statement. Let me first read through the original question carefully to understand all the details.\n\nThe problem states: Let A and x be n×n and n×1 matrices, respectively, with all entries real and strictly positive. Assume that A²x = x. Show that Ax = x. The user mentions they haven't covered eigenvalues and eigenvectors yet, so solutions should rely on more basic linear algebra concepts.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The problem mentions several conditions. Let's break them down one by one:\n\n1. A is an n×n matrix. (Specifies the dimensions of A)\n2. x is an n×1 matrix. (Specifies the dimensions of x)\n3. All entries of A are real and strictly positive. (Positivity condition for A)\n4. All entries of x are real and strictly positive. (Positivity condition for x)\n5. A²x = x. (Given matrix equation)\n\nEach assumption should address only one property applied to one object. So, entries of A and x being positive are separate assumptions. Also, the matrix dimensions for A and x are separate. Then the equation A²x = x is another assumption.\n\nThe problem is to show that Ax = x under these conditions. \n\nI need to ensure that in the assumption section, each point is a single condition. Let me check the example provided. In the example, the assumptions were split into \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7.\" Similarly, here, each aspect of A and x should be separate.\n\nSo, the assumptions would be:\n\n- A is an n×n matrix.\n- x is an n×1 matrix.\n- All entries of A are real and strictly positive.\n- All entries of x are real and strictly positive.\n- A²x = x.\n\nAnd the problem is to show that Ax = x.\n\nWait, the original problem states \"all entries real and strictly positive\" for both A and x. So each of those is a separate assumption. Also, their dimensions. Then the equation.\n\nI need to make sure there are no combined assumptions. For example, not combining \"A is n×n and has positive entries\" into one line. Each should be separate.\n\nSo yes, each of those points should be separate lines in the assumption section. Then the problem is to show Ax = x given those assumptions.\n\nThe user also mentioned that their previous attempt had a wrong answer and another using a theorem they haven't studied, so the solution must avoid eigenvalues. But the formatting here doesn't require solving, just structuring the problem.\n\nSo, the final formatted problem should have the assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property, and then the problem statement.",
