    "Content": "Let $\\lambda > 1$ , want to show that the equation $$\\lambda-z-e^{-z}=0$$ has exactly one solution in the right half plane $\\{z:Re(z)>0\\}$. Moreover, the solution must be real. I tried to use Rouche's theorem on $g(z)=\\lambda - z$ and $f(z)=e^{-z}$ to get that the number of zeros of $f+g$ and the number of zeros of $g(z)$ is the same, and since $g(z)$ has only one solution then the equation about must also have one solution the problem is I don't know how to choose the correct curve $\\gamma$ such that this will work. for the second part I used the IVT to show that $\\lambda -x-e^{-x}$ has a zero in  $(0,\\lambda)$ to conclude that the solution is real. is this acceptable? Thank you for your help.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "A hint. If $\\operatorname{Re} z > 0$ and $\\lambda - z - e^{-z} = 0$ then $$\n|\\lambda - z| = e^{-\\operatorname{Re} z} < 1.\n$$ In other words, if the equation has any solutions in the right half-plane then they lie in the open disc $|z-\\lambda|<1$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me first read through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe user's question is about proving that the equation λ - z - e^{-z} = 0 has exactly one solution in the right half-plane (where Re(z) > 0) and that this solution is real. They mentioned trying to use Rouché's theorem with g(z) = λ - z and f(z) = e^{-z}, but had trouble choosing the correct curve γ. They also used the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT) to argue that there's a real solution in (0, λ) and want to know if that's acceptable.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states λ > 1, which is a key assumption. The equation is given as λ - z - e^{-z} = 0. The solution is to be in the right half-plane (Re(z) > 0) and must be real. So, the assumptions should list each condition separately.\n\nLooking at the example provided, assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property. So here:\n\n1. λ is a real number greater than 1.\n2. The equation considered is λ - z - e^{-z} = 0.\n3. The solution is in the right half-plane, i.e., Re(z) > 0.\n4. The solution must be real. Wait, but the problem is to show that the solution is real, so maybe the assumption here is just that λ > 1, and the rest are part of the problem statement. Wait, no. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So the user filtered the conditions. Here, the original problem states \"Let λ > 1\", which is an assumption. The equation is given, so that's part of the problem statement. The problem wants to show two things: existence of exactly one solution in the right half-plane and that the solution is real. So those are the things to prove, not assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n- λ is a real number.\n- λ is greater than 1.\n- The equation is λ - z - e^{-z} = 0.\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"Let λ > 1\", so that's the primary assumption. The problem is to show that under this assumption, the equation has exactly one solution in the right half-plane and that the solution is real. So in the assumptions, each line should be one condition. So λ > 1 is one assumption, and maybe the equation is part of the problem statement.\n\nWait, looking back at the example:\n\nOriginal problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The user formatted the assumption as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But actually, the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7; perhaps that was a correction or added assumption? Wait, in the example, maybe the user made a mistake? Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Wait, the original problem is to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, they added that n is divisible by 7 as an assumption. That might be incorrect. But perhaps in that case, the user's example might be wrong. So maybe in the example, the actual problem had more context, like n being divisible by 7, but perhaps the original problem didn't state that. Hmm, confusing.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the formatted problem includes assumptions that were perhaps not all present in the original problem. So perhaps the user is expecting to extract all given conditions as assumptions, even if they are part of the problem's statement. So in the current problem, \"Let λ > 1\" is an assumption. The equation is given as λ - z - e^{-z} = 0. The problem is to show it has exactly one solution in the right half-plane and that the solution is real.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- λ is a real number greater than 1.\n- The equation is λ - z - e^{-z} = 0.\n- The solution is considered in the right half-plane (Re(z) > 0).\n\nWait, but the right half-plane is part of where the solution should be, so is that an assumption or part of the problem? The problem is to show that there is exactly one solution in the right half-plane, so the problem statement includes that. Therefore, the assumption is only λ > 1. Because the problem is to show under the condition λ >1, the equation has exactly one solution in the right half-plane, which is real. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- λ is a real number.\n- λ is greater than 1.\n\nThe problem is then: Prove that the equation λ - z - e^{-z} = 0 has exactly one solution in the right half-plane {z : Re(z) > 0}, and that this solution is real.\n\nBut in the example, the user included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as two separate assumptions, even though the original problem was for every integer n. So maybe the process is to list all given conditions as assumptions, even if they are part of the problem's premise.\n\nIn this case, the original problem states \"Let λ > 1\", so that's an assumption. The equation is given. The right half-plane is part of the problem's requirement. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- λ is a real number.\n- λ is greater than 1.\n- The equation is λ - z - e^{-z} = 0.\n\nBut the problem is to show existence in the right half-plane, so the right half-plane isn't an assumption. Alternatively, maybe the problem statement includes considering solutions in the right half-plane, which is part of the problem's setting.\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me look at the example again. The original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions were \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\", and the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. But wait, in the original problem, n is any integer, but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Unless maybe the original problem had a typo or the user made a mistake. So maybe the example is not accurate. Alternatively, maybe the user wanted to filter unrelated information. For example, the original problem might have had additional context where n is an integer divisible by 7, but the user restructured it. But given that the example is as such, perhaps the assumptions are all the given conditions in the problem, each on separate lines.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question says \"Let λ > 1\", so that's one assumption. The equation is given as λ - z - e^{-z} = 0. The right half-plane is the domain where the solution is to be found. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- λ is a real number greater than 1.\n- The equation λ - z - e^{-z} = 0 is considered.\n- Solutions are sought in the right half-plane {z : Re(z) > 0}.\n\nBut the problem is to show that there's exactly one solution in that right half-plane and that it's real. So the right half-plane is part of the problem's context, not an assumption. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions are just λ > 1 and the equation. Wait, but in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", which was split into \"n is an integer\". So following that, in this case, \"Let λ > 1\" becomes \"λ is a real number greater than 1\". Then the equation is part of the problem statement.\n\nSo maybe:\n\nAssumptions:\n- λ is a real number.\n- λ is greater than 1.\n- The equation is λ - z - e^{-z} = 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the equation has exactly one solution in the right half-plane {z : Re(z) > 0}, and that this solution is real.\n\nBut wait, the original problem mentions \"has one solution in the right half plane\" and \"the solution must be real\". So the problem is to prove two things: existence/uniqueness in the right half-plane and reality of the solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the right half-plane is part of the problem's setting, so the assumptions are only about λ. Let me check the user's example again. In the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", which was split into \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. Then there was an additional assumption that \"n is divisible by 7\". But in the original problem, it was not stated that n is divisible by 7. So maybe the user made a mistake in the example, but regardless, the task is to structure the problem given.\n\nIn the current problem, the user mentions wanting to show the equation has exactly one solution in the right half-plane, which is a condition on the solution, so that's part of what needs to be proved, not an assumption. The assumptions are the given conditions: λ > 1 and the equation itself.\n\nSo the correct assumptions would be:\n\n- λ is a real number.\n- λ is greater than 1.\n\nThe problem is to prove that the equation λ - z - e^{-z} = 0 has exactly one solution in the right half-plane {z : Re(z) > 0} and that this solution is real.\n\nBut the user also included the equation as part of the problem in the example. In the example, the equation was part of the problem statement. So perhaps the equation is part of the problem, not the assumption. Wait, in the example, the problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91, with A(n) defined as 5^n(...). The assumptions were about n. So the equation (the expression for A(n)) was part of the problem statement.\n\nSimilarly, in this case, the equation is part of the problem. So the assumptions are λ >1, and the problem is to analyze the equation. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- λ is a real number greater than 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that the equation λ - z - e^{-z} = 0 has exactly one solution in the right half-plane {z : Re(z) > 0} and that this solution is real.\n\nYes, that makes sense. The equation is part of the problem statement, and the assumption is λ >1. The original problem starts with \"Let λ >1\", so that's the key assumption. The rest is what needs to be proven.\n\nSo final answer would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nλ is a real number,\nλ is greater than 1.\nProblem: \nProve that the equation $$\\lambda - z - e^{-z} = 0$$ has exactly one solution in the right half-plane $\\{z : \\text{Re}(z) > 0\\}$ and that this solution is real.\n###",
