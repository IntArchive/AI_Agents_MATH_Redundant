    "Content": "I was working on homomorphisms and related concepts and I was wondering whether there exist some good criteria involving $H$ and $G_{1}$ which guarantees that all homomorphism $\\phi$ on the subgroup $H$ of $G_{1}$ into an arbitrary group $G_{2}$ can be extended to a homomorphism $\\bar{\\phi}$ from all of $G_{1}$ to $G_{2}$ . And just to be clear: When I speak of an extension, I mean that I require that $\\bar{\\phi}$ restricted to H reduces to $\\phi$ . ​\nMy current conjecture is that this is possible for all homomorphism on $H$ if and only if there exists a normal subgroup $N$ of $G_{1}$ such that $H$ is isomorphic to $G_{1}/N$ The criteria is certainly sufficient since then $G_{1}$ is the semidirect product of H and N and by mapping all elements in N to the identity in $G_{2}$ a homomorphism is constructed.\nI've not been able to produce a proof that it is necessary also. Any ideas or arguments in favour or against the conjecture? Edit: As stated in the answer below my criteria for it being a semidirect product is actually wrong. You need the canoncial projection h $\\mapsto$ [h] to be an isomorphism. It then guarantees trivial intersection and G = NH",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Your conjecture is almost true. But you need more than just $G/N$ isomorphic to $H$ . See below the line. Explicitly: The group $G_1$ and subgroup $H$ satisfy the stated property if and only if there exists a normal subgroup $N$ of $G_1$ such that $G_1=NH$ and $N\\cap H=\\{e\\}$ . That is, $H$ must be a retract of $G_1$ (h/t to Moishe Kohan ). Sufficiency follows as you indicate. For necessity, as usual with this kind of statements, the key is to pick a particular (clever?) choice of $G_2$ and $\\phi$ to force the desired conclusion. Suppose $H$ and $G_1$ , with $H\\leq G_1$ , has the property that for every group $G_2$ and every morphism $\\phi\\colon H\\to G_2$ there exists a morphism $\\psi\\colon G_1\\to G_2$ such that $\\psi|_{H} = \\phi$ . Take $G_2=H$ , and $\\phi=\\mathrm{id}_H$ . Then there exists $\\psi\\colon G_1\\to H$ such that $\\psi|_{H}=\\mathrm{id}_H$ . In particular, if we compose $\\iota\\colon H\\hookrightarrow G_1$ with $\\psi$ , we get $\\psi\\circ\\iota\\colon H\\to H$ and $\\psi\\circ\\iota(h) = \\psi(h) = h$ for all $h\\in H$ . That is, $\\psi$ splits the embedding $\\iota\\colon H\\hookrightarrow G_1$ . Let $N=\\mathrm{ker}(\\psi)$ . Then $N\\cap H=\\{e\\}$ . Given $g\\in G_1$ , we have $g(\\iota(\\psi(g))^{-1}\\in N$ , since $$\\psi(g)\\psi(\\iota(\\psi(g)))^{-1} = \\psi(g)\\psi(g)^{-1}=e;$$ thus, $g\\in NH$ . Hence, $G_1=NH$ , $N\\triangleleft G_1$ , and $N\\cap H=\\{e\\}$ . Therefore, $G_1/N\\cong H$ , as desired. The error in your argument for sufficiency is that you are asserting that $G/N\\cong H$ implies that $G$ is an internal semidirect product of $N$ by $H$ . This is not true in general. For example, take $G=Q_8$ , the quaternion group of order $8$ , and let $H=\\{1,-1\\}$ . Then $G$ contains four different normal subgroups $N$ with $G/N\\cong H$ , but we know that $G$ is not a semidirect product. You cannot extend the identity map of $H$ to a homomorphism $Q_8\\to C_2$ ; you can map $Q_8$ to $C_2$ , but it won't extend the identity map of $H$ because $H$ is contained in all the nontrivial normal subgroups of $Q_8$ . You cannot decompose $Q_8$ as an internal semidirect product. So you need more than just $G/N$ isomorphic to $H$ ; you need that projection to split. That is, you need $G$ to be the internal semidirect product of $N$ by $H$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me start by reading the original problem carefully.\n\nThe user is asking about extending homomorphisms from a subgroup H of G1 to the entire group G1 into any group G2. They conjecture that this is possible if and only if there's a normal subgroup N of G1 such that H is isomorphic to G1/N. They mention that sufficiency comes from G1 being a semidirect product of H and N, allowing mapping N to the identity in G2. But they're unsure about the necessity and point out a correction regarding the semidirect product criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to list all assumptions. The problem involves groups G1 and G2, a subgroup H of G1, homomorphisms from H to G2, and extensions to all of G1. The conjecture involves the existence of a normal subgroup N in G1 such that H is isomorphic to G1/N. \n\nAssumptions should be one per line, each addressing a single property or condition on one object. Let's break it down:\n\n1. G1 is a group.\n2. H is a subgroup of G1.\n3. G2 is an arbitrary group.\n4. φ: H → G2 is a homomorphism.\n5. There exists a normal subgroup N of G1 such that H is isomorphic to G1/N. (This is part of the conjecture)\n6. The extension homomorphism φ̄: G1 → G2 must restrict to φ on H.\n\nWait, but the problem is about the conjecture that such extensions exist for all φ if and only if such N exists. So the problem is to prove or disprove this conjecture. The user's own thoughts mention sufficiency (if part) but necessity (only if) is in question.\n\nSo, in the Assumption section, we need to list the conditions given in the problem. The problem itself is about whether the existence of such an N is necessary and sufficient for all homomorphisms φ on H to be extendable to G1.\n\nBut how to structure the assumptions? Let's see the example given. The original example had n being an integer and divisible by 7 as assumptions, then the problem to prove divisibility.\n\nIn this case, the problem is more about the conditions required. The user's conjecture is that the extension is possible for all homomorphisms φ if and only if there's a normal subgroup N of G1 with H isomorphic to G1/N.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would include:\n\n- G1 is a group.\n- H is a subgroup of G1.\n- G2 is an arbitrary group.\n- φ: H → G2 is a homomorphism.\n- There exists a normal subgroup N of G1 such that H ≅ G1/N.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to determine whether the existence of such N is equivalent to all φ being extendable. So the problem is to prove or disprove that equivalence.\n\nTherefore, the problem statement is: Determine whether every homomorphism φ from a subgroup H of G1 to any group G2 can be extended to a homomorphism φ̄ from G1 to G2 if and only if there exists a normal subgroup N of G1 such that H is isomorphic to G1/N.\n\nBut the user's original problem is phrased as asking for criteria involving H and G1, so maybe the problem is to prove the conjecture stated.\n\nIn the example, the problem was to prove divisibility given the assumptions. Here, the problem would be to prove that the extension is possible for all φ if and only if there's such a normal subgroup N.\n\nSo the assumptions would be the given conditions, but the conjecture is part of the problem.\n\nWait, the example had:\n\nAssumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nIn the current case, the user's conjecture is the if and only if condition. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- G1 is a group.\n\n- H is a subgroup of G1.\n\n- G2 is an arbitrary group.\n\n- φ: H → G2 is a homomorphism.\n\n- The extension φ̄: G1 → G2 must restrict to φ on H.\n\nBut the problem is the conjecture itself. Alternatively, maybe the assumptions are the parts that are given in the problem, and the problem is the conjecture.\n\nWait, the example included in the assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Then the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nIn this case, the user is proposing a conjecture (if and only if condition), so perhaps the problem is to determine the validity of the conjecture. Therefore, the assumptions would be the context: groups, subgroup, homomorphism, etc., and the problem is to prove or disprove the conjecture.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions are the conditions given in the conjecture. Let me parse the original problem again.\n\nOriginal question: \"My current conjecture is that this is possible for all homomorphism on H if and only if there exists a normal subgroup N of G1 such that H is isomorphic to G1/N...\"\n\nSo the conjecture is the statement to prove. Hence, the problem would be: Prove that every homomorphism from H to G2 can be extended to G1 if and only if there exists a normal subgroup N of G1 such that H is isomorphic to G1/N.\n\nThus, the assumptions would include:\n\n- G1 is a group.\n\n- H is a subgroup of G1.\n\n- G2 is an arbitrary group.\n\n- φ: H → G2 is a homomorphism.\n\n- An extension of φ is a homomorphism φ̄: G1 → G2 such that φ̄|H = φ.\n\nWait, but the example only listed the specific assumptions that are part of the problem's conditions. In the example, n is an integer and divisible by 7. Then the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nHere, the conjecture is about the equivalence. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- G1 is a group.\n\n- H is a subgroup of G1.\n\n- For every group G2, every homomorphism φ: H → G2 can be extended to a homomorphism φ̄: G1 → G2.\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists a normal subgroup N of G1 such that H is isomorphic to G1/N.\n\nBut the conjecture is an if and only if. So the problem is to prove that the following are equivalent:\n\n1. For every group G2 and every homomorphism φ: H → G2, there exists an extension φ̄: G1 → G2.\n\n2. There exists a normal subgroup N of G1 such that H ≅ G1/N.\n\nBut how to structure this? The user's original problem states their conjecture as the equivalence. So the problem is to prove this conjecture.\n\nIn the example, the assumptions were specific to the problem (n is integer, divisible by 7), then the problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91.\n\nIn this case, the problem is more abstract. The assumptions would be the group-theoretic context. Let me think of each assumption line by line.\n\nAssumption lines:\n\n- G₁ is a group.\n\n- H is a subgroup of G₁.\n\n- G₂ is an arbitrary group.\n\n- φ: H → G₂ is a homomorphism.\n\n- A homomorphism φ̄: G₁ → G₂ is an extension of φ if φ̄ restricted to H equals φ.\n\nBut the conjecture is that this extension is always possible for all φ if and only if there exists a normal subgroup N of G₁ such that H is isomorphic to G₁/N.\n\nTherefore, the problem statement is to prove this equivalence.\n\nBut in terms of formatting, the problem part would state the conjecture as the problem to solve. The assumptions would be the general conditions (groups, subgroups, homomorphisms, extensions).\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumptions included that n is divisible by 7, which was a specific condition. Here, the conjecture is a general statement, so the assumptions are the general setting.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- G₁ is a group.\n\n- H is a subgroup of G₁.\n\n- For every group G₂, every homomorphism φ: H → G₂ has an extension φ̄: G₁ → G₂.\n\n- There exists a normal subgroup N of G₁ such that H is isomorphic to G₁/N.\n\nBut no, the conjecture is that the first condition (all homomorphisms can be extended) is equivalent to the second (existence of N). So the problem is to show that these two statements are equivalent.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would list the general objects involved, and the problem is to prove the equivalence.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. In the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the assumptions were that n is an integer and divisible by 7.\n\nSimilarly, here, the problem is to prove the equivalence. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- G₁ is a group.\n\n- H is a subgroup of G₁.\n\n- G₂ is an arbitrary group.\n\n- φ: H → G₂ is a homomorphism.\n\n- An extension of φ is a homomorphism φ̄: G₁ → G₂ such that φ̄|H = φ.\n\nBut the problem is to prove the equivalence between the extension property and the existence of N.\n\nWait, maybe the problem statement should be phrased as: Prove that the following are equivalent:\n\n1. For every group G₂ and every homomorphism φ: H → G₂, there exists an extension φ̄: G₁ → G₂.\n\n2. There exists a normal subgroup N of G₁ such that H ≅ G₁/N.\n\nBut the original user's problem was to ask whether their conjecture is correct. Therefore, the problem is to determine if the conjecture is true, i.e., prove or disprove the equivalence.\n\nBut in the example, the problem was to prove a specific statement. Here, it's to prove an equivalence.\n\nBut how to phrase this in the Problem section? Maybe:\n\nProblem: Prove that for a subgroup H of G₁, every homomorphism φ: H → G₂ can be extended to a homomorphism φ̄: G₁ → G₂ if and only if there exists a normal subgroup N of G₁ such that H is isomorphic to G₁/N.\n\nBut the user's original problem mentions \"all homomorphism on H\" and \"into an arbitrary group G₂\". So the problem is the equivalence between:\n\n- All homomorphisms from H to any G₂ can be extended.\n\n- Existence of a normal N in G₁ with H ≅ G₁/N.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are the group structures:\n\n- G₁ is a group.\n\n- H is a subgroup of G₁.\n\n- G₂ is an arbitrary group.\n\n- φ is a homomorphism from H to G₂.\n\n- An extension φ̄ is a homomorphism from G₁ to G₂ extending φ.\n\nBut the problem is the equivalence.\n\nIn the example, the assumptions were specific to the problem (n is integer, divisible by 7), then the problem was to prove divisibility. Here, the problem is more general. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- G₁ is a group.\n\n- H is a subgroup of G₁.\n\n- For every group G₂, every homomorphism φ: H → G₂ can be extended to a homomorphism φ̄: G₁ → G₂.\n\n- There exists a normal subgroup N of G₁ such that H is isomorphic to G₁/N.\n\nBut no, the problem is the equivalence between these two statements. Therefore, the problem is to show that these two conditions are equivalent.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were the premises, and the problem was the conclusion. Here, the problem is to show the equivalence. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- G₁ is a group.\n\n- H is a subgroup of G₁.\n\nAnd the problem is to prove that the following are equivalent:\n\n1. Every homomorphism from H to any group G₂ can be extended to a homomorphism from G₁ to G₂.\n\n2. There exists a normal subgroup N of G₁ such that H is isomorphic to G₁/N.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be phrased as determining the validity of the conjecture. But the example's problem was a direct statement. So perhaps the problem here is:\n\nProve that for a subgroup H of a group G₁, the following are equivalent:\n\n(a) Every homomorphism φ: H → G₂ into any group G₂ can be extended to a homomorphism φ̄: G₁ → G₂.\n\n(b) There exists a normal subgroup N of G₁ such that H is isomorphic to G₁/N.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would include that G₁ is a group, H is a subgroup, and G₂ is arbitrary. But the example's assumptions listed specific conditions (n integer, divisible by 7), not general context. Hmm, maybe in this case, the general context is considered the problem's setting, and the assumptions are the specific conditions in the conjecture.\n\nBut perhaps the key is to filter unrelated information. The original question had some details about semidirect products and the user's own thoughts, but the core problem is about the conjecture.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should capture the necessary conditions from the problem statement. Let's try:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- G₁ is a group.\n\n- H is a subgroup of G₁.\n\n- G₂ is an arbitrary group.\n\n- φ: H → G₂ is a homomorphism.\n\n- An extension of φ is a homomorphism φ̄: G₁ → G₂ such that φ̄|H = φ.\n\nProblem: Prove that every homomorphism φ: H → G₂ can be extended to φ̄: G₁ → G₂ if and only if there exists a normal subgroup N of G₁ such that H is isomorphic to G₁/N.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were the specific conditions given (n is integer, divisible by 7), and the problem was to prove divisibility. Here, the problem is more about characterizing when extensions exist. So the assumptions are the general group-theoretic setup, and the problem is the equivalence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's original problem includes that the extension must exist for all homomorphisms φ and all groups G₂, which is part of the conjecture's condition. Therefore, the assumptions would include that, and the problem is to prove the existence of N.\n\nBut no, the problem is the equivalence. So the correct way is to state the problem as proving the equivalence between two statements.\n\nBut according to the format, the problem should be a single statement. The example's problem was a single statement to prove. Here, it's an equivalence. So perhaps:\n\nProblem: Prove that the following statements are equivalent for a subgroup H of a group G₁:\n\n1. Every homomorphism φ: H → G₂ into any group G₂ can be extended to a homomorphism φ̄: G₁ → G₂.\n\n2. There exists a normal subgroup N of G₁ such that H is isomorphic to G₁/N.\n\nBut how does this fit into the format? The user's example had the problem as a single statement. In this case, the problem is an equivalence. I think that's acceptable.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n\nG₁ is a group,\n\nH is a subgroup of G₁,\n\nG₂ is an arbitrary group,\n\nφ: H → G₂ is a homomorphism,\n\nAn extension of φ is a homomorphism φ̄: G₁ → G₂ such that φ̄ restricted to H equals φ.\n\nProblem: Prove that the following are equivalent:\n\n1. Every homomorphism φ: H → G₂ can be extended to a homomorphism φ̄: G₁ → G₂.\n\n2. There exists a normal subgroup N of G₁ such that H is isomorphic to G₁/N.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the assumptions were listed as separate points. Each assumption is a single line. So each bullet point in the assumption is a separate line here. Let me adjust:\n\nAssumption:\n\nG₁ is a group,\n\nH is a subgroup of G₁,\n\nG₂ is an arbitrary group,\n\nφ: H → G₂ is a homomorphism,\n\nAn extension of φ is a homomorphism φ̄: G₁ → G₂ with φ̄|H = φ.\n\nProblem: Prove that every homomorphism φ: H → G₂ can be extended to φ̄: G₁ → G₂ if and only if there exists a normal subgroup N of G₁ such that H is isomorphic to G₁/N.\n\nBut the problem is to prove an equivalence. However, the original problem's example had the problem as a single statement. The user's question is about whether the conjecture (the equivalence) holds. Therefore, the problem should be phrased as proving the equivalence.\n\nBut I need to check if the assumptions are correctly capturing the necessary conditions. The original problem mentions extending homomorphisms on H into arbitrary groups G2. So the key assumptions are that G1 is a group, H is its subgroup, and G2 is arbitrary. The problem is to show that the extension property holds for all G2 and all φ if and only if H is isomorphic to G1/N for some normal N.\n\nThus, the assumptions would be:\n\n- G₁ is a group.\n\n- H is a subgroup of G₁.\n\n- G₂ is an arbitrary group.\n\n- φ: H → G₂ is a homomorphism.\n\n- An extension of φ is a homomorphism φ̄: G₁ → G₂ such that φ̄|H = φ.\n\nProblem: Prove that the following are equivalent:\n\n1. For every group G₂ and every homomorphism φ: H → G₂, φ can be extended to φ̄: G₁ → G₂.\n\n2. There exists a normal subgroup N of G₁ such that H ≅ G₁/N.\n\nBut in the example, the problem was a single statement. Here, it's an equivalence. However, the format allows the problem to be phrased as proving the equivalence. I think this is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nG₁ is a group,\nH is a subgroup of G₁,\nG₂ is an arbitrary group,\nφ: H → G₂ is a homomorphism,\nAn extension of φ is a homomorphism φ̄: G₁ → G₂ such that φ̄ restricted to H equals φ.\nProblem:\nProve that the following statements are equivalent:\n1.
