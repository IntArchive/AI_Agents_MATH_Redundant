    "Content": "Question (asking on behalf of my friend who studies abstract algebra): Is there a group $G$ and subgroup $H$ , such that there exists $g\\in G$ with $gHg^{-1} \\subset H$ and $|H:gHg^{-1}|$ is infinite? ( I incline to think this is true.) For such an example to exist, $H$ (and hence $G$ ) must be infinite and a non-normal subgroup of $G$ . At first, it seems easy. However, I really don't know many types of infinite nonabelian groups (perhaps only the general linear group ${GL}_n(F)$ and the group of bijections). Thanks for your slightest effort.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $\\,G\\,$ be the free group generated by $\\,g,x_1,x_2,\\dots\\,$ modded by the equations $\\,gx_ng^{-1} = x_{n+1}\\,$ for all $n>0.$ Let $\\,H\\,$ be the subgroup generated by all the $\\,x_n.\\,$ The index of $\\,gHg^{-1}\\,$ in $\\,H\\,$ is infinite because $\\,x_1\\,$ has infinite order. Note that there are more concrete ways to represent the groups and specializations where all the $\\,x_n\\,$ commute with each other but not with $\\,g.\\,$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is asking whether there exists a group G and a subgroup H such that there's an element g in G where the conjugate gHg^{-1} is a proper subset of H, and the index of gHg^{-1} in H is infinite. \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem states that G is a group, H is a subgroup, there exists a g in G such that gHg^{-1} is strictly contained within H. Additionally, the index |H : gHg^{-1}| is infinite. The original question also mentions that H must be infinite and non-normal in G, which are conditions that follow from the problem's requirements.\n\nSo, breaking down the assumptions line by line: G is a group, H is a subgroup of G, there exists an element g in G, the conjugate gHg^{-1} is a subset of H, the index of gHg^{-1} in H is infinite. Each of these points addresses a single condition applied to one object. \n\nI should check if the example provided by the user matches the required format. The original example had assumptions listed as separate lines, each with one condition. Here, similar structure applies. The problem is to prove the existence of such G and H with the specified properties. So the formatted problem should list each assumption on separate lines and then present the problem statement.",
