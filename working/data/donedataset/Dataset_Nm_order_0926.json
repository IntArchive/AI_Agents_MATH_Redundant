    "AcceptedAnswer": "After a little inspection, we see that\n$$\nE(|X+Y|-|X-Y|) = 2E[Z(1_{XY\\geq 0}-1_{XY<0})]\n$$\nwhere $Z = \\min(|X|,|Y|)$. Remember that for any non-negative random variable $T$,\n$$\nE(T) = \\int_0^\\infty P(T>t)\\,dt.\n$$ We apply this with $T=Z\\,1_{X \\geq 0, Y\\geq 0}$, $T=Z\\,1_{X < 0, Y< 0}$ and $T=Z\\,1_{X \\geq 0, Y< 0}$. Since $\\{Z > t\\} = \\{|X| > t\\}\\cap\\{|Y| > t\\}$, we obtain $$\nE(Z \\,1_{X \\geq 0,Y\\geq 0}) = \\int_0^\\infty P(X > t)P(Y > t)\\,dt = \\int_0^\\infty P(X > t)^2\\,dt\n$$ $$\nE(Z\\, 1_{X < 0, Y < 0}) = \\int_0^\\infty P(X < -t)P(Y < - t)\\,dt = \\int_0^\\infty P(X < -t)^2\\,dt\n$$ $$\nE(Z\\,1_{X \\geq 0, Y< 0}) = E(Z\\,1_{\\{X < 0, Y \\geq 0\\}}) = \\int_0^\\infty P(X > t)P(X < -t)\\,dt\n$$ So finally,\n$$\nE(|X+Y|-|X-Y|) = 2\\int_0^\\infty (P(X>t)-P(X<-t))^2\\,dt \\geq 0\n$$ Remark 1. The inequality is an equality if and only if the distribution of $X$ is symetric, that is $P(X > t) = P(X < -t)$ for any $t \\geq 0$. Remark 2. When $|X|=1$ a.s. the inequality is nothing but the semi-trivial fact that if $X$ and $Y$ are independent with same distribution, then $P(XY \\geq 0) \\geq \\dfrac{1}{2}$. Remark 3. It is worthwile to mention a nice corollary : $E(|X+Y|) \\geq E(|X|)$. The function $x \\mapsto |x|$ is convex hence $|X| \\leq \\frac{1}{2}(|X+Y|+|X-Y|)$. Taking expectations we find\n$$\n\\Bbb E(|X+Y|-|X|) \\geq \\frac{1}{2}\\Bbb E(|X+Y|-|X-Y|) \\geq 0.\n$$\nFurthermore, there is an equality if and only if $X=0$ a.s.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about proving that the expected value of |X - Y| is less than or equal to the expected value of |X + Y| when X and Y are i.i.d. variables with finite expectation.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that X and Y are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), so that's two separate conditions. Then, they have finite mathematical expectation, which is another condition. The problem is to prove the inequality E(|X - Y|) ≤ E(|X + Y|).\n\nWait, the example given in the user's instruction had an assumption where n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem, that wasn't mentioned. Wait, no, looking back, the example seems to have added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, no, the original problem in the example was to prove divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Hmm, maybe that was a mistake in the example? Because 91 is 7*13, so maybe the problem actually assumes that n is such that it works for 91, but the user's example added that assumption. But in the current problem, the original question doesn't have additional assumptions beyond X and Y being i.i.d. with finite expectation.\n\nWait, but the user's example might have had an error. Let me check again. The original example problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. But that might not be correct, unless the problem actually had that condition. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect, but the user is showing how they want the format. So in the example, the user included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. Hmm, perhaps the user made a mistake there. But regardless, the task is to structure the current problem as per the format, which is to list all the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object.\n\nSo for the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\n1. X and Y are independent random variables.\n2. X and Y have the same distribution (i.i.d.).\n3. X and Y have finite mathematical expectation.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. Then the problem is to prove the inequality E(|X - Y|) ≤ E(|X + Y|).\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is one line, one condition per line. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nX and Y are independent,\nX and Y have the same distribution,\nX has finite mathematical expectation,\nY has finite mathematical expectation.\n\nWait, but since X and Y are identically distributed, if X has finite expectation, Y does too. So maybe the user's original problem states \"the finite mathematical expectation\" for both. So perhaps it's redundant, but according to the problem statement, it's given that both have finite expectation. But since they are i.i.d., maybe just stating that they have finite expectation once. But according to the format, each assumption should be applied to one object. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nX and Y are independent,\nX and Y are identically distributed,\nX has finite expectation,\nY has finite expectation.\n\nBut since they are identically distributed, once X has finite expectation, Y automatically does. But the problem statement says \"X,Y are i.i.d. variables and the finite mathematical expectation\". So the user might have meant both have finite expectation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that both have finite expectation, so we need to list that for both variables. However, in the example given by the user, they listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem didn't state the divisibility. Wait, that example seems off. Maybe the user intended to include all given conditions as separate assumptions, even if redundant. For the current problem, the original question states that X and Y are i.i.d. and have finite expectation. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- X and Y are independent\n- X and Y are identically distributed\n- X has finite expectation\n- Y has finite expectation\n\nBut since they are identically distributed, maybe the last two can be combined into \"X and Y have finite expectation\". But the example splits conditions even if they apply to the same object. For instance, in the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are separate lines even though both apply to n. So following that, for the current problem, we should list each condition separately, even if they apply to the same object. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nX and Y are independent,\nX and Y are identically distributed,\nX has finite expectation,\nY has finite expectation.\n\nBut perhaps the original problem states \"the finite mathematical expectation\", which might be referring to both variables together. Wait, the original problem says \"the finite mathematical expectation\", which could mean that both X and Y have finite expectation. So maybe the assumption is that X and Y each have finite expectation. But in the example, even though n was an integer and then divisible by 7, which are separate, so perhaps each condition is a separate line. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nX and Y are independent,\nX and Y are identically distributed,\nX has finite expectation,\nY has finite expectation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"X and Y have finite expectation\" as a single line, but the example splits them. Wait, the example had two lines for n: \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So even if both apply to the same object, each condition is a separate line. Therefore, for the current problem, even though X and Y are identically distributed, their finite expectations might be considered separate conditions. However, in reality, if X and Y are identically distributed, then X has finite expectation iff Y does. So maybe it's redundant, but according to the problem statement, the user might list them separately. Alternatively, the problem says \"the finite mathematical expectation\", which could imply that both have finite expectation. But the problem statement in the example added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem, which might be a mistake. But since the user provided that example, perhaps they want to split all possible conditions, even if redundant. Therefore, to follow the example's structure, perhaps list each condition on a separate line:\n\nAssumption:\nX and Y are independent,\nX and Y are identically distributed,\nX has finite expectation,\nY has finite expectation.\n\nBut the problem statement says \"X,Y are i.i.d. variables and the finite mathematical expectation\". The \"i.i.d.\" part covers independent and identically distributed. Then \"finite mathematical expectation\" applies to both. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nX and Y are independent,\nX and Y are identically distributed,\nX has finite expectation,\nY has finite expectation.\n\nAlternatively, since \"i.i.d.\" includes independence and identical distribution, but the finite expectation is separate. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nX and Y are independent,\nX and Y are identically distributed,\nX has finite expectation,\nY has finite expectation.\n\nBut since they are identically distributed, the last two can be combined as \"X and Y have finite expectation\". But according to the example, each condition is applied to one object. So if X has finite expectation and Y has finite expectation, even though they are the same due to identical distribution, it's listed as two separate assumptions. Alternatively, maybe the problem just states that both have finite expectation, so it's a single assumption. But the example split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", so splitting is needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's original statement says \"the finite mathematical expectation\", which could be a single condition applying to both variables. But the user's format requires each condition applied to one object. So perhaps the correct way is:\n\nAssumption:\nX and Y are independent,\nX and Y are identically distributed,\nX has finite expectation,\nY has finite expectation.\n\nThis way, each line is one condition applied to one object. Even though identically distributed would imply that if X has finite expectation, so does Y, but perhaps the problem states both, so we list both. Alternatively, maybe the problem states that \"the finite mathematical expectation\" applies to both, so as a single assumption. But the example splits, so I'll follow that approach.",
