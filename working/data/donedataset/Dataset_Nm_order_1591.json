    "AcceptedAnswer": "If $a \\neq c$, then look at what happens if we replace both $a$ and $c$ with $x = (a+c)/2$ : $x^2 \\ge x^2 - (\\frac {a-c}2)^2 = ac$. Since the function $x \\mapsto x \\log x$ is convex (its second derivative is $1/x$ which is positive),\n$\\log(a^ac^c) = a \\log a + c \\log c \\ge 2x \\log x = \\log (x^{2x})$. Hence $2a^ab^bc^cd^d \\ge 2x^xb^bx^xd^d$ , $x^2+bd \\ge ac+bd$ , and we still have $x+b+x+d = a+b+c+d = 2$ so it is enough to prove the inequality when $a=c$ (and when $b=d$, for symmetry reasons). So we are left with proving that if $x+y = 1$ then $2x^{2x}y^{2y} \\ge x^2 + y^2$. Let $x = \\frac {1+z}2$ and $y = \\frac {1-z}2$. After simplifying, we have to prove that for $|z| < 1$, $(\\frac{1+z}{1-z})^z \\frac {1 - z^2}{1 + z^2} \\ge 1$. Taking logs, we have to show $z \\log(1+z) - z \\log(1-z) + \\log(1-z^2) - \\log(1+z^2) \\ge 0$.\nUsing $\\log$'s power series at $1$, this is $(2z^2 + 2z^4/3 + 2z^6/5 + 2z^8/7 + 2z^{10}/9 +\\ldots) - (2z^2 + 2z^6/3 + 2z^{10}/5 + \\ldots) \\ge\n(2z^2 + 2z^6/3 + 2z^{10}/5 + 2z^{14}/7 + 2z^{18}/9 + \\dots) - (2z^2 + 2z^6/3 + 2z^{10}/5 + \\ldots) = 0$ There probably is something smarter to do instead, but this works.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's look at this problem. The user wants me to structure it according to the specified format. The original question is about proving an inequality involving variables a, b, c, d with a condition on their sum.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that a, b, c, d are positive numbers and their sum is 2. Each assumption should be listed separately. So, the first assumption is that a is a positive number. Then, similarly for b, c, and d. But wait, the example given in the initial query had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. Here, the conditions are that each variable is positive and their sum is 2. However, according to the example, each line should address only one property or condition applied to one object. \n\nWait, but the variables a, b, c, d are all positive numbers. So maybe each of them needs to be listed as separate assumptions? But that's redundant. Alternatively, maybe \"a, b, c, d are positive numbers\" as one assumption, and \"a + b + c + d = 2\" as another. But in the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are two separate lines. So perhaps here, the first assumption is \"a, b, c, d are positive numbers\" (but the example used singular for each), but maybe the user wants each variable to be stated separately? Wait, in the example, they had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate lines. But here, the variables a, b, c, d are all positive numbers. So maybe it's better to list each variable as positive. However, the problem states \"Let a, b, c, d be positive numbers\", so maybe each is an assumption. But that would result in four assumptions. However, in the example, only two assumptions for one variable. Alternatively, maybe group them: \"a, b, c, d are positive numbers\" as one assumption, and the sum condition as another. The example's first assumption was \"n is an integer\", and the second \"n is divisible by 7\". So, the problem here has two main conditions: positivity of all variables and their sum. So, perhaps the assumptions should be:\n\n1. a, b, c, d are positive numbers.\n2. a + b + c + d = 2.\n\nBut the example had each assumption on separate lines. However, the example had two separate conditions on the same variable n. Here, the two conditions apply to different objects: the variables being positive and their sum. So maybe two assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\na, b, c, d are positive numbers,\na + b + c + d = 2.\n\nThen the problem is to show that 2a^a b^b c^c d^d ≥ ac + bd.\n\nBut I need to check if the original problem has any other hidden assumptions. The user's original problem says \"Let a,b,c,d be positive numbers such that a+b+c+d=2. Show that...\". So the key assumptions are positivity and the sum. Therefore, structuring as two assumptions. Each line in the assumption section should address one property or condition, applied to one object. Wait, but the first assumption is about four variables. The example had \"n is an integer\" which is a single variable. So maybe the user expects each variable's positivity to be listed separately? But that would be four lines. However, in mathematical problems, it's common to state \"Let a, b, c, d be positive numbers\" as a single condition. But according to the example given, each assumption line is about one property. So in the example, the first line is about n being integer, the second about n being divisible by 7. So for this problem, perhaps the first line is \"a, b, c, d are positive numbers\", and the second line is \"a + b + c + d = 2\".\n\nYes, that seems correct. The problem's constraints are two: positivity of all variables and the sum. So two assumptions. Then the problem statement is to show the inequality. Therefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\na, b, c, d are positive numbers,\na + b + c + d = 2.\nProblem:\nShow that $$2a^a b^b c^c d^d \\ge ac + bd.$$\n\nBut wait, the original problem title was \"How prove this inequality $2a^ab^bc^cd^d\\ge ac+bd$\". The user also mentioned their attempt, but that's part of the original question, not part of the assumptions or problem statement. So the answer should filter out the user's attempt and other unrelated info. So the structured problem should include only the assumptions and the problem statement. Therefore, the answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \na, b, c, d are positive numbers,\na + b + c + d = 2.\nProblem:\nShow that $$2a^a b^b c^c d^d \\ge ac + bd.$$\n###",
