    "Content": "Yesterday, Asaf Karagila's answer to my question sparked an extensive discussion on ways of proving that all countable ordinals are embeddable in $\\Bbb Q$, and whether particular solutions to this use the Axiom of Choice. Since the arguments used to prove this can be shady on their use of Choice when formulated tersely, fully fleshed out answers are appreciated. To be concrete, this question asks for proofs of the following fact: All countable ordinals $\\alpha < \\omega_1$ are order-embeddable in the rationals $\\Bbb Q$. Especially answers avoiding the Axiom of Choice are appreciated. Of relevance and related interest is #123969 (but it's not a duplicate, since that question asks for explicit embeddings).",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The trick, as the discussion in the comments to my answer, is to notice the order of the quantifiers. Given $\\alpha<\\omega_1$ we construct an embedding by transfinite recursion, from $\\alpha$ into $\\omega_1$. Actually we construct a bit more, we construct a sequence of embeddings $\\langle f_\\beta\\mid\\beta\\leq\\alpha\\rangle$, such that $f_\\beta\\colon\\beta\\to\\Bbb Q$ is an order embedding, and its range is bounded. $f_0=\\varnothing$. Suppose that $f_\\beta$ were defined (we don't care about the entire sequence at this point), and $q\\in\\Bbb Q$ is some upper bound to $\\operatorname{rng}f_\\beta$. Then $f_{\\beta+1}=f_\\beta\\cup\\{\\langle\\beta,q\\rangle\\}$ is an order embedding, as wanted. Suppose that $\\beta$ is limit, and $\\langle f_\\gamma\\mid\\gamma<\\beta\\rangle$ were defined. We write $\\beta$ as the union of intervals $[\\gamma_n,\\gamma_{n+1})$, each of order type $\\beta_n$. Trivially, $\\beta_n<\\beta$, so we can embed it into $\\Bbb Q$ using $f_{\\beta_n}$. Let $g_n$ be the composition of $f_{\\beta_n}$ with an order isomorphism of $\\Bbb Q$ with $(0,1)\\cap\\Bbb Q$. We define the follow $g\\colon\\beta\\to\\Bbb Q$: $$g(\\delta)=n+g_n(\\varepsilon),\\qquad\\delta\\in[\\gamma_n,\\gamma_{n+1}),\\ \\varepsilon<\\beta_n,\\ \\delta=\\gamma_n+\\varepsilon.$$ This is well-defined because each $\\delta$ appears in a unique interval, and can be written uniquely as such sum of two ordinals. It is not hard to see that $g_n$ is indeed injective, and order preserving, but it is unbounded. Let $f_\\beta$ be the composition of $g$ with the order-isomorphism of $\\Bbb Q$ with $(0,1)\\cap\\Bbb Q$, then $f_\\beta$ is an embedding whose range is bounded.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format a problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified structure. The example they provided shows breaking down assumptions line by line and stating the problem clearly.\n\nFirst, I need to read the given question on Math Stack Exchange. The title is about countable ordinals being embeddable in the rationals, and the question is asking for proofs of this fact, especially those avoiding the Axiom of Choice. The original question mentions that the discussion was sparked by Asaf Karagila's answer and that the user wants to clarify the use of AC in these proofs.\n\nNow, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem statement is about proving that all countable ordinals are order-embeddable in the rationals. The key points here are:\n\n1. The ordinal α is countable. So, α is a countable ordinal.\n2. The ordinal α is less than ω₁, which is the first uncountable ordinal. So, α < ω₁.\n3. The embedding is into the rationals, Q, with their usual order.\n4. The proof should avoid the Axiom of Choice if possible.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, are all these assumptions? The problem is to prove that every countable ordinal (so α < ω₁) embeds into Q. The question is asking for proofs, especially those avoiding AC. But in the example given earlier, the assumptions listed were about the objects involved. So here, the main assumptions are that α is a countable ordinal (i.e., α < ω₁), and we need to embed it into Q. The problem is to prove that such an embedding exists, possibly without using AC.\n\nBut the original problem's question doesn't state any specific assumptions beyond that α is a countable ordinal. The user is asking for proofs that may or may not use AC. So the problem itself is the statement that all countable ordinals are order-embeddable into Q. The assumptions would just be that α is a countable ordinal (i.e., α < ω₁), and that the embedding is into Q with its order. Wait, but in the example, the assumptions included both the variable (n is an integer) and a condition (n is divisible by 7). Here, the problem's assumption is that α is a countable ordinal (α < ω₁). So the Assumption section should list that. But maybe also that Q is the set of rationals with their usual order? But that's part of the problem's context. Hmm.\n\nLooking at the example again: the original problem was about A(n) being divisible by 91. The user structured the assumption as n being an integer and n divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the divisibility by 7 isn't stated. Wait, the example's original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted example, the assumption is n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But that's conflicting. Wait, maybe there was a mistake in the example? Because the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7. Wait, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, the assumption is that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, perhaps the example was a typo, but regardless, I need to follow the user's instruction based on their example.\n\nWait, maybe the user intended that sometimes the original problem may have additional hidden assumptions, but in their example, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem says \"for every integer n\". That seems contradictory. Maybe the user's example is wrong, but I have to follow the structure they want. So perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions are that α is a countable ordinal (i.e., α < ω₁) and that we're considering order-embeddings into Q. But does the problem have any other assumptions? The problem is to prove that every such α embeds into Q. So the assumptions are:\n\n- α is a countable ordinal (i.e., α < ω₁)\n- The embedding is an order-embedding (i.e., preserves the order structure)\n- The target is the rational numbers Q with their usual order.\n\nBut since the problem is to show that such an embedding exists, perhaps the only assumption is that α is a countable ordinal, and the rest is part of the problem statement. For example, in the example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the assumptions were n is an integer and n divisible by 7, but that seems to conflict with the original problem's \"for every integer n\". So maybe there's a mistake in the example, but perhaps in the current problem, the only assumption is that α is a countable ordinal. So:\n\nAssumption:\nα is a countable ordinal (α < ω₁),\nThe embedding is into the rationals Q with their usual order.\n\nBut wait, the target being Q is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. The problem is to prove that every countable ordinal can be embedded into Q. So the problem is the statement, and the assumptions would be the conditions given on α. The problem's original question states \"All countable ordinals α < ω₁ are order-embeddable in the rationals Q\". So the assumption is that α is a countable ordinal (α < ω₁). The problem is to prove that such an order-embedding exists into Q. The mention of avoiding AC is part of the question's request for proofs, not part of the problem's assumptions. So the problem itself is as stated, and the assumptions are only about α being a countable ordinal. Therefore, in the Assumption section, we list:\n\n- α is a countable ordinal (α < ω₁)\n\nAnd the problem is to prove that α is order-embeddable into Q.\n\nWait, but in the example, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", the formatted assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\". That might be a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a typo. For instance, if the problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 when n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem statement, it's written as \"for every integer n\". So maybe the example is incorrect, but the user's intention is to list all the assumptions of the problem, which may include conditions that are part of the problem statement. So perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- α is a countable ordinal (α < ω₁)\n- The embedding is an order-embedding\n- The target space is the rationals Q with their usual order\n\nBut the problem statement is to prove that such an embedding exists. So the problem is \"Prove that every countable ordinal α < ω₁ is order-embeddable into the rationals Q.\"\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would include:\n\nα is a countable ordinal (α < ω₁),\nQ is the set of rational numbers with the standard order,\nThe embedding is order-preserving.\n\nBut maybe the user wants each assumption to be a single line addressing one property of one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nα is a countable ordinal (α < ω₁),\nQ is the set of rational numbers with the standard order,\nThe embedding is order-preserving.\n\nBut perhaps \"The embedding is order-preserving\" is part of the problem statement rather than an assumption. Wait, the problem is to show that such an order-embedding exists. So the definition of an order-embedding is part of the problem's requirements, not an assumption. So the only assumption is that α is a countable ordinal. The rest (target is Q, embedding is order-preserving) is part of what needs to be proven. Hmm, but maybe the problem statement implicitly assumes that Q is ordered, which is standard. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- α is a countable ordinal (α < ω₁),\n- Q is considered with its usual order.\n\nBut perhaps the user wants each assumption to be one line, each addressing one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nα is a countable ordinal,\nα < ω₁,\nQ is the set of rational numbers,\nQ is equipped with its usual order,\nThe embedding is order-preserving.\n\nBut that might be overcomplicating. Alternatively, since the problem is to embed α into Q as an order, the key assumption is that α is countable. The rest is part of the target structure. But in the example, the assumptions were n is an integer and n divisible by 7, even though the problem said \"for every integer n\", which seems conflicting. That suggests maybe the example is incorrect, but the user wants to split the problem's conditions into separate assumptions. So in this case, the problem's main assumption is that α is a countable ordinal (i.e., α < ω₁). So:\n\nAssumption:\nα is a countable ordinal (α < ω₁).\n\nProblem:\nProve that α is order-embeddable into the rationals Q.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to prove that every countable ordinal is order-embeddable into Q, so the assumption is that α is a countable ordinal (since the problem states \"for all countable ordinals α < ω₁\"), so the assumption is that α is such an ordinal. The problem is to prove the embedding exists. So I think that's the way to structure it.",
