    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's take a look at this problem from Math Stack Exchange. The user wants to prove a specific closed-form expression for an infinite series. The original question is quite detailed with a lot of information, so I need to filter out the essential parts and structure it according to the given format.\n\nFirst, the main problem is about proving the conjectured identity for the sum S. The user provides the series definition, the proposed closed form involving α, and mentions that it's equivalent to πS being a root of a certain polynomial. There's also a recurrence relation for the terms a(n) and some numerical results.\n\nNow, the task is to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then state the problem concisely.\n\nStarting with the assumptions. The series starts at n=1, so that's an assumption. The general term of the series is given with factorials, Gamma functions, and (-256)^n in the denominator. Each part of the term's formula should be considered. The recurrence relation for a(n+1) in terms of a(n) is another assumption, as well as the initial condition a(1) being a specific value. The equivalence to the polynomial root is part of the problem statement, but since it's a consequence of the conjecture, maybe it's not an assumption. The conjectured closed form involving α is the thing to prove, so that's the problem part.\n\nWait, the assumptions should be the given conditions or properties that are part of the problem setup. So the recurrence relation and the initial term are part of the assumptions. Also, the structure of the series term (with Gamma functions, factorial, etc.) is part of the definition. The definition of α is given as part of the conjectured identity, so maybe that's part of the problem statement rather than an assumption. The polynomial equivalence might be a hint or an alternative form, but since the user states that the conjecture is equivalent to πS being a root, perhaps that's part of the problem to show, but maybe not. The problem is to prove the closed-form identity. The recurrence and initial condition are part of the setup, so they should be listed as assumptions.\n\nSo breaking down:\n\nAssumptions:\n1. The summation starts at n=1: sum_{n=1}^\\infty.\n2. Each term of the series is (4n)! divided by [Gamma(2/3 + n) * Gamma(4/3 + n) * (n!)^2 * (-256)^n].\n3. The sequence a(n) satisfies the recurrence relation: a(n+1) = -9*(2n+1)(4n+1)(4n+3)/(32*(n+1)(3n+2)(3n+4)) * a(n).\n4. The initial term a(1) is -81*sqrt(3)/(512*pi).\n\nProblem: Prove that the sum S equals sqrt(3)/(2*pi) * [2*sqrt(8/sqrt(α) - α) - 2*sqrt(α) - 3], where α is defined as 2*(1 + sqrt(2))^{1/3} - 2/(1 + sqrt(2))^{1/3}.\n\nWait, the problem as stated in the original question is to prove the conjectured identity. The equivalence to the polynomial root is another way to state it, but maybe that's part of the problem's alternate phrasing, so perhaps not necessary to include unless it's part of the problem. However, the user says \"the conjecture is equivalent to...\", so maybe that's an additional part of the problem. But the main problem is to prove the equality S = that expression. So the problem statement should focus on that.\n\nAlso, need to check if all the elements in the original question are captured. The recurrence and initial condition are part of the setup, so they are assumptions. The definition of the series, the terms, and the closed-form with α. The polynomial part is another way to state the conjecture but perhaps not necessary for the problem statement unless required. Since the user says \"the conjecture is equivalent to...\", maybe that's a separate part, but the main problem is to prove the closed form. So the problem should be to prove S equals the given expression in terms of α.\n\nSo, to structure:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The sum S is defined as the series from n=1 to ∞ of [(4n)! / (Γ(2/3 + n) Γ(4/3 + n) (n!)^2 (-256)^n)].\n- The sequence a(n) in the sum satisfies a(1) = -81√3/(512π).\n- For n ≥ 1, a(n+1) = -9(2n+1)(4n+1)(4n+3)/(32(n+1)(3n+2)(3n+4)) * a(n).\n\nProblem: Prove that S = [√3/(2π)] [2√(8/√α - α) - 2√α - 3], where α = 2*(1 + √2)^{1/3} - 2/(1 + √2)^{1/3}.\n\nBut wait, the problem as stated in the original question is to prove the conjectured identity. The assumptions are the definitions and conditions given. So each element in the sum's definition, the recurrence, and the initial term are assumptions. The problem is the equality S = that expression.\n\nTherefore, formatted correctly:\n\nAssumption:\nThe summation is from n=1 to infinity,\nEach term in the summation is (4n)! divided by [Γ(2/3 + n) * Γ(4/3 + n) * (n!)^2 * (-256)^n],\nThe sequence a(n) satisfies a(1) = -81√3/(512π),\nThe sequence a(n) satisfies the recurrence relation a(n+1) = -9(2n+1)(4n+1)(4n+3)/(32(n+1)(3n+2)(3n+4)) * a(n).\n\nProblem: Prove that the sum S equals (√3/(2π))(2√(8/√α - α) - 2√α - 3), where α = 2∛(1 + √2) - 2/∛(1 + √2).\n\nYes, that seems right. Each assumption is a single condition applied to one object. For example, the recurrence is applied to a(n), the initial term is applied to a(1), the summation's starting point and term structure are separate assumptions.",
