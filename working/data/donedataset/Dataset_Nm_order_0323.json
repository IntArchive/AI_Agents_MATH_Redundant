    "Content": "Given $f(x) = \\frac{1}{2}x^TAx + b^Tx + \\alpha $ where A is an nxn symmetric matrix, b is an n-dimensional vector, and alpha a scalar. Show that $\\bigtriangledown _{x}f(x) = Ax + b$ and $H = \\bigtriangledown ^{2}_{x}f(x) = A$ Is this simply a matter of taking a derivative with respect to X, how would you attack this one?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "$\\nabla f = (\\partial f/\\partial x_1, \\ldots, \\partial f/\\partial x_n)^t$ denotes the vector of partial derivatives of $f$ and is a completely standard notation. On the other hand, $\\nabla^2 f$ seems to be used here in an unusual way, namely to denote the Hessian (the matrix of all second order partial derivatives), $(\\partial^2 f/\\partial x_i \\partial x_j)_{i,j=1}^n$. (The usual meaning of $\\nabla^2 f$ is the Laplacian, $\\partial^2 f/\\partial x_1^2 + \\ldots + \\partial^2 f/\\partial x_n^2$.)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to show that the gradient and Hessian of the function f(x) are Ax + b and A, respectively. The function given is a quadratic form: f(x) = (1/2)x^T A x + b^T x + α. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what the gradient and Hessian represent. The gradient of a scalar function is a vector of its first derivatives with respect to each variable, and the Hessian is the matrix of second derivatives. Since A is symmetric, that should simplify things because the transpose of A is itself, which might help when computing derivatives.\n\nStarting with the gradient. Let's expand the function f(x). The term (1/2)x^T A x is a quadratic term. When taking the derivative of this with respect to x, I remember that the derivative of x^T A x with respect to x is (A + A^T)x. But since A is symmetric, A^T = A, so this becomes 2A x. Hence, multiplying by 1/2, the derivative of the quadratic term should be A x. Then, the derivative of the linear term b^T x is just b, since the derivative of b^T x with respect to x is b. The scalar α disappears because its derivative is zero. So putting it all together, the gradient ∇f(x) should be A x + b, which matches the statement they need to prove.\n\nNow for the Hessian. The Hessian is the derivative of the gradient. Since the gradient is A x + b, taking the derivative of this with respect to x should give us the matrix A. Because the derivative of A x with respect to x is A, and the derivative of b (a constant vector) is zero. So the Hessian H is indeed A.\n\nI need to make sure there are no mistakes here. Let me check the derivative of the quadratic term again. Suppose x is a vector, then x^T A x is a scalar. The gradient of this scalar with respect to x is (A + A^T)x. But since A is symmetric, A + A^T = 2A, so the gradient is 2A x. Multiply by 1/2, we get A x. That's correct. Then adding the derivative of b^T x, which is b, so total gradient is A x + b. The Hessian is then the Jacobian of A x + b, which is just A, as each component of the gradient is linear in x, so the second derivatives are the coefficients, which are the entries of A. Yes, that makes sense. \n\nI think that's all. The key steps are recognizing the derivative rules for quadratic and linear terms in multivariable calculus, and using the symmetry of A to simplify the expressions.",
