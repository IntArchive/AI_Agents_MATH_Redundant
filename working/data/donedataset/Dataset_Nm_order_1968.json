    "AcceptedAnswer": "The golden rule for all problems about greatest common divisors, I claim (especially if you're specifically trying to avoid using prime decomposition), is the fact that $\\gcd(a,b)$ is equal to the smallest positive integer $g$ that can be written in the form $g=ax+by$ with $x,y$ integers. In particular, $\\gcd(a,b)=1$ if and only if there exist integers $x$ and $y$ such that $ax+by=1$. (This is not true with 1 replaced by a larger integer! It's true because 1 is the smallest positive integer there is.) That's my general hint; my specific hint is to cube both sides of the equation $ax+by=1$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that if gcd(a, b) = 1, then gcd(a², b²) = 1 without using prime decomposition. They specified using definitions of gcd, division algorithm, Euclidean algorithm, and related corollaries. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the relevant properties. The gcd of two numbers is the largest integer that divides both. If gcd(a, b) = 1, then a and b are coprime. The goal is to show their squares are also coprime. \n\nSince prime factorization is off the table, I should think about the Bézout identity or properties from the Euclidean algorithm. Bézout's theorem states that if gcd(a, b) = d, then there exist integers x and y such that ax + by = d. Since gcd(a, b) = 1, there are x and y with ax + by = 1. Maybe squaring this equation could help? Let's see: (ax + by)² = 1. Expanding gives a²x² + 2abxy + b²y² = 1. Hmm, this combines a² and b² terms with coefficients. If I can express 1 as a linear combination of a² and b², then their gcd would be 1. But the middle term has 2abxy, which isn't directly a multiple of a² or b². Maybe this approach isn't sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, use the Euclidean algorithm. If gcd(a, b) = 1, then applying the algorithm to a² and b². The Euclidean algorithm steps involve gcd(a², b²) = gcd(b², a² mod b²). Maybe express a² in terms of b². But how does gcd(a, b) = 1 affect this? Let's consider that any common divisor of a² and b² must divide both a² and b². Let d = gcd(a², b²). Then d divides a² and d divides b². Since d divides a² and d divides b², d must also divide any linear combination, like the ones from Bézout. Wait, if d divides a² and b², and since gcd(a, b) = 1, does d have to be 1?\n\nAnother angle: use the property that if gcd(a, b) = 1, then gcd(a, b²) = 1. Because if a prime divides a and b², it would divide b, contradicting gcd(a, b)=1. But we can't use primes. Instead, use Bézout again. If gcd(a, b) = 1, then there's ax + by = 1. Then, for gcd(a, b²), we can write ax + b*(b y') = 1, where y' is some integer. Wait, not sure. Alternatively, apply the Euclidean algorithm step to a and b². Since gcd(a, b²) = gcd(a, b² mod a). But b² mod a can be written as (b mod a)² mod a? Not sure. Maybe need to break it down further.\n\nAlternatively, suppose d divides a² and d divides b². Then d divides their gcd. If we can show that d must divide 1, then done. So, let d = gcd(a², b²). Then d divides a² and b². Since d divides a², it divides a. Similarly, d divides b², so it divides b. Wait, no. If d divides a², does d divide a? Not necessarily. For example, if d = 4, a = 2, then 4 divides 4 (a²=4), but 4 divides 2? No. So that reasoning is flawed. So that approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, but if d divides a² and d divides b², and gcd(a, b) = 1, then maybe d must divide 1. How? Since d divides a² and d divides b², any common divisor of a² and b² must divide a² and b². But if d is such a divisor, then any prime divisor of d must divide both a² and b², hence divide a and b, contradicting gcd(a, b) = 1. But again, the user doesn't want prime decomposition used. So that's out.\n\nAnother approach: Use the fact that gcd(a, b) = 1 implies that there exist integers x and y such that ax + by = 1. Then, square both sides to get 1 = (ax + by)² = a²x² + 2abxy + b²y². Rearranged, 1 = a²x² + b²y² + 2abxy. Hmm, but this expresses 1 as a combination of a² and b², but there's that middle term 2abxy. However, if we can find a combination of a² and b² that equals 1, then their gcd must divide 1, hence it's 1. But here, the combination includes a term with ab. Wait, but maybe we can manipulate this equation. Let's see:\n\nLet me consider that 1 = a²x² + b²y² + 2abxy. Let's group terms: 1 = a²x² + b²y² + 2abxy. Notice that this is similar to (ax + by)^2, which is 1. So if we have 1 as a square, but how does that help? Alternatively, perhaps we can find a linear combination of a² and b² that gives 1. Let's see. Suppose we can write 1 = k*a² + m*b². If possible, then gcd(a², b²) divides 1. To get such k and m, maybe from the original Bézout coefficients. Let's see:\n\nStarting from ax + by = 1. Let's square both sides: 1 = a²x² + 2abxy + b²y². Then, rearrange: 1 = a²x² + b²y² + 2abxy. If I can express the 2abxy term in terms of a² or b². For instance, since ax + by =1, then abx = b(1 - by)/x? Not sure. Alternatively, multiply both sides of ax + by =1 by something. Maybe multiply by a: a²x + aby = a. Similarly, multiply by b: abx + b²y = b. But not sure how that helps.\n\nAlternatively, consider that since gcd(a, b) =1, then gcd(a, b²)=1 and gcd(a², b²)=1. But to prove gcd(a, b²)=1 without primes. Let's try that. Suppose d divides a and d divides b². Then d divides a and d divides b². Since d divides a and gcd(a, b)=1, d must divide 1. Hence, gcd(a, b²)=1. Similarly, gcd(b², a²) would then be 1. Wait, but how to formalize that without using primes?\n\nSo, let me try to structure this. Assume d divides a² and d divides b². We need to show d divides 1. Since d divides a² and d divides b², then d divides any linear combination, like a²x² + b²y². From the squared equation earlier, we have a²x² + b²y² = 1 - 2abxy. But d divides the left side, so d divides 1 - 2abxy. Therefore, d divides 1. Hence, d=1. Wait, but does this work?\n\nLet me see: If d divides a² and d divides b², then d divides a²x² + b²y². But from the expansion, a²x² + b²y² = 1 - 2abxy. Therefore, d divides (1 - 2abxy). But d also divides 2abxy, since d divides a² and b², so d divides ab (since a² = a*a and b² = b*b, so d divides a and d divides b? Wait, no. If d divides a², it doesn't necessarily divide a. For example, d=4 divides a²=4, but a=2, which is not divisible by 4. So this approach might not hold.\n\nAlternatively, let's use the property that gcd(a², b²) = (gcd(a, b))². Since gcd(a, b) =1, then gcd(a², b²)=1. But is this a standard result? The user probably can't use that unless it's proven from the allowed methods. So maybe need to prove that gcd(a², b²) = (gcd(a, b))² using Euclidean algorithm.\n\nYes, the Euclidean algorithm. Since gcd(a, b) =1, then using the property that gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, b - ka) for any integer k. Similarly, gcd(a², b²) can be computed using steps similar to the Euclidean algorithm. Let me try to apply the Euclidean algorithm to a² and b².\n\nStart with gcd(a², b²). Since gcd(a, b)=1, we can write a = q*b + r using division algorithm. Then a² = (q*b + r)^2 = q²b² + 2qbr + r². Then, gcd(a², b²) = gcd(b², r²). Repeating this process, since the Euclidean algorithm for a and b would eventually reach 1, then applying it to their squares might also reach 1. But need to formalize this.\n\nAlternatively, since gcd(a, b)=1, there exist x and y such that ax + by=1. Then, using the fact that gcd(a², b²) divides a² and b², so it divides any combination. If I can show that gcd(a², b²) divides 1, then it must be 1. So, let d = gcd(a², b²). Then d divides a² and d divides b². Also, d divides (a²x² + b²y²). But from earlier, a²x² + b²y² = 1 - 2abxy. So d divides 1 - 2abxy. But does d divide 2abxy? Since d divides a² and d divides b², then d divides a² and b². Let’s see: Since d divides a², any prime divisor of d divides a, but we can’t use primes. Alternatively, if d divides a² and d divides b², then since gcd(a, b)=1, then d must be 1. Wait, but how to show this without prime factors?\n\nMaybe use induction or the Euclidean algorithm steps. For example, since gcd(a, b)=1, in the Euclidean algorithm, the last non-zero remainder is 1. If we apply the same steps to a² and b², maybe the remainders will also lead to 1. For instance, first step: gcd(a², b²) = gcd(b², a² mod b²). Let’s denote r = a mod b, so a = qb + r, then a² = (qb + r)² = q²b² + 2qbr + r². Then a² mod b² = r² + 2qbr mod b². Wait, but this seems complicated. Alternatively, note that if a and b are coprime, then so are b and r (since r = a - qb, and gcd(b, r) = gcd(a, b) =1). Then gcd(a², b²) = gcd(b², r²). Since gcd(b, r)=1, then repeating the process would eventually reduce to gcd(1,1)=1. But this requires formalizing the steps.\n\nAlternatively, use the property that if gcd(a, b)=1, then gcd(a², b)=1. Then similarly, gcd(a², b²)=gcd(b², a²)=1. Let me try that. First, prove gcd(a², b)=1. Since gcd(a, b)=1, there's ax + by=1. Multiply both sides by a: a²x + aby = a. Then, any common divisor of a² and b must divide a and b, but gcd(a, b)=1. So, d divides a² and b, then d divides a (from a²x + aby = a), but d divides b, hence d divides gcd(a, b)=1. Thus, gcd(a², b)=1. Similarly, gcd(a², b²)=gcd(b², a²)=1. Wait, but how to apply the same logic to gcd(a², b²)?\n\nIf we already have gcd(a², b)=1 and gcd(b², a)=1, then perhaps using the property that gcd(a², b²) divides gcd(a², b) * gcd(a², b). Not sure. Alternatively, apply the same method again. Let me see: Suppose d divides a² and d divides b². Then d divides a² and d divides b². From the previous step, gcd(a², b)=1, so d must divide 1. Hence, d=1. Wait, does this hold? If d divides a² and d divides b², then since d divides b² and gcd(a², b)=1, then d divides 1. But does that follow? Because d is a divisor of a² and b², but how does that relate to gcd(a², b)=1?\n\nAlternatively, since d divides b², and gcd(a², b)=1, then gcd(d, b)=1. But d divides a², so gcd(d, b)=1 and d divides a². But how does that help? Maybe not directly. \n\nAnother approach: Use the fact that if gcd(a, b)=1, then lcm(a, b)=ab. But not sure if that helps here. \n\nAlternatively, use mathematical induction. For example, fix a and use induction on b. Not sure. \n\nWait, going back to the Bézout identity. We have ax + by =1. If we cube both sides, maybe get terms with a² and b². Let me try: (ax + by)^3 = 1. Expanding gives a³x³ + 3a²x²by + 3abxy²b² + b³y³ =1. Hmm, but this introduces higher powers. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, take the original equation ax + by =1 and multiply by ax: a²x² + abxy = ax. Similarly, multiply by by: abxy + b²y² = by. Adding these: a²x² + 2abxy + b²y² = ax + by =1. Wait, this is the same as squaring. So we get back to the same equation. But how to isolate a² and b² terms?\n\nPerhaps rearrange the squared equation: a²x² + b²y² =1 - 2abxy. Now, if we can write 1 as a combination of a² and b² plus some multiple of abxy, but we need to show that 1 is in the ideal generated by a² and b². If 1 is in that ideal, then gcd(a², b²)=1. But the presence of the term -2abxy complicates things. However, notice that ab is a multiple of both a² and b²? No, ab isn't necessarily a multiple of a² unless b is a multiple of a, which it's not since they're coprime. \n\nAlternatively, note that since gcd(a, b)=1, then gcd(a², b²)=1 because any common divisor must divide 1. But this is circular unless justified.\n\nWait, perhaps use the lemma that if gcd(a, b)=1, then gcd(a, b²)=1. Let's prove that first. Suppose d divides a and d divides b². Then d divides a and d divides b². Since gcd(a, b)=1, d divides 1. Hence, gcd(a, b²)=1. Similarly, gcd(a², b²)=gcd(b², a²). Now, since gcd(a², b²) divides a² and b². From above, gcd(a², b²) divides b² and a². But since gcd(a², b)=1 (from the previous step where gcd(a², b)=1), then gcd(a², b²) must divide 1. Hence, gcd(a², b²)=1.\n\nYes, that seems plausible. Let me verify this step-by-step.\n\n1. Given gcd(a, b)=1.\n2. Prove gcd(a, b²)=1:\n   - Let d divide a and d divide b².\n   - Then d divides gcd(a, b²).\n   - But d divides a and d divides b², so d divides b (since d divides b² and if d were a prime, it would divide b, but we can't use primes. However, using Bézout: if d divides a and d divides b², then since gcd(a, b)=1, there exist x and y such that ax + by=1. Multiply both sides by d: a d x + b d y = d. But d divides a and d divides b d y, so d divides the left side, hence d divides the right side, which is d. Not helpful. Alternatively, since d divides a and gcd(a, b)=1, then gcd(d, b)=1. But d divides b², so gcd(d, b²)=d. But gcd(d, b²)=d, and since gcd(d, b)=1, then gcd(d, b²)=1. Hence, d=1. Therefore, gcd(a, b²)=1.\n\n3. Now, consider gcd(a², b²):\n   - Let d = gcd(a², b²).\n   - d divides a² and d divides b².\n   - From step 2, gcd(a², b)=1. So any common divisor of a² and b must be 1.\n   - Since d divides b², and d divides a², can we relate this to gcd(a², b)=1?\n   - If d divides b², then d divides b*b. So any common divisor of a² and b² must divide b² and a². But since gcd(a², b)=1, then d and b are coprime. Because if d and b had a common divisor greater than 1, that divisor would also divide a² and b, contradicting gcd(a², b)=1. Therefore, d must divide 1. Hence, gcd(a², b²)=1.\n\nThis seems to work without prime decomposition, using Bézout and properties of gcd. The key steps are proving gcd(a, b²)=1 and then using that to show gcd(a², b²)=1 by considering the divisors and their relationships.\n\nTherefore, the proof can be structured using these steps, relying on the definitions and properties of gcd, Bézout's identity, and the Euclidean algorithm indirectly through the properties of divisibility.",
