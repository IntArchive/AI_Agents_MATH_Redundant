    "Content": "Let $f(z)$ be an entire function such that $$|f(z)|<\\frac{1}{|\\text{Im}(z)|},\\qquad z\\in\\Bbb C-\\Bbb R.$$ The question asked me to prove that $f(z)=0$. At least looking at it, it really seems to have an application of Liouville's theorem lurking around somewhere, but I haven't found it. My thoughts first led me to think about doing this by contradiction and using Picard's little theorem. So, I've considered a strip containing the real axis (say of width $2$ for simplicity). This will imply the complement maps into the unit disk, which implies that this strip has to map almost everywhere else on the complex plane. Now, on the imaginary axis, I know that $f(z)$ will vanish as $z\\to\\infty$, and this seems like it might be useful. I'm sort of under the impression $f(z)$ might have an essential singularity at $\\infty$, which would mean $f(1/z)$ has an essential singularity at $0$. Either way, it of course can't have a pole at $\\infty$ because of $f(z)$ vanishing on the imaginary axis, and if it is a removable singularity, it must be $0$, which still gives the solution. Therefore, I think it must have something to do with $f(z)$ having an essential singularity at $\\infty$. I was hoping to combine this with the above inequality and deduce a contradiction, but I haven't thought of one yet. Any hints or suggestions? I'm studying for a prelim. exam, so this isn't homework. Update: So, in the spirit of searching methods using the essential singularity at $z=0$, we have $$\\left|f\\left(\\frac{1}{z}\\right)\\right|\\leq\\frac{1}{\\left|\\text{Im}\\left(\\frac{1}{z}\\right)\\right|}=\\frac{|z|^2}{|y|}.$$ Thus, for $|y|>1$, we have $$\\left|f\\left(\\frac{1}{z}\\right)\\right|<|y|\\left|f\\left(\\frac{1}{z}\\right)\\right|<|z|^2.$$ Thus, if I can show that $|f(1/z)|$ is a polynomial, we'll know it can't have an essential singularity at the origin, concluding my proof.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $w \\in \\mathbb{C}$ and let $R > |w|$.   We first bound the analytic function $(z^2 - R^2)f(z)$ on the circle $|z| = R$. If $|z| = R$ and $\\operatorname{Re}z \\ge 0$, then $$|(z- R)f(z)| \\le \\frac{|z - R|}{\\operatorname{Im}z} = \\sec \\theta$$ where $\\theta \\in [0, \\dfrac{\\pi}{4}]$ so $|(z - R)f(z)| \\le \\sqrt{2}$. For $\\operatorname{Re} z \\le 0$ and $|z| = R$, we have $$|(z + R)f(z)| \\le \\sqrt{2}$$ Hence, $$|(z^2 - R^2)f(z)| \\le 3R$$ on $|z| = R$. By the maximum modulus principle the same bound holds in the interior of the disk $|z| \\le R$ and so $$|f(w)| \\le \\frac{3R}{|w^2 - R^2|}$$ \nLetting $R \\to \\infty$, we get the desired result.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to structure this problem according to the given format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions from the original question. The user mentions that f(z) is an entire function, so that's one assumption. Then, the inequality |f(z)| < 1/|Im(z)| holds for all z in C minus R. So that's another condition. The problem is to prove that f(z) is identically zero. \n\nWait, the original problem says \"prove that f(z)=0\". So the assumptions are:\n\n1. f(z) is entire.\n2. For every z not on the real line, |f(z)| is less than 1 divided by the absolute value of the imaginary part of z.\n\nSo those are the key points. The user's own thoughts include considering the essential singularity at infinity, but those are part of their attempt, not the problem's given conditions. The structured problem should only include the given assumptions, not the user's thoughts or attempted methods. So the assumptions are about f being entire and satisfying that inequality off the real axis. The problem is to show f is zero everywhere.\n\nChecking the example provided, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. The original problem mentioned \"for every integer n\", but the formatted version included an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7, which seems specific. Wait, maybe in that example, the user might have included an extra assumption? Wait, no, looking back, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Hmm, but 91 is 7*13, so maybe the example had a mistake. But regardless, in this current problem, the user hasn't added any extra assumptions beyond what's given in the problem. The problem states f is entire and satisfies that inequality, and the task is to prove f=0.\n\nSo the assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\nf(z) is entire,\nFor all z ∈ ℂ \\ ℝ, |f(z)| < 1/|Im(z)|.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f(z) = 0.\n\nI think that's it. The user's own thoughts about essential singularities, Picard's theorem, etc., are part of their solution attempt, but the problem itself doesn't include those as assumptions. So the formatted problem should just list those two assumptions.",
