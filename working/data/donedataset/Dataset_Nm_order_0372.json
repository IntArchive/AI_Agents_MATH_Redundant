    "Content": "I would be very thankful if someone could give me a hint with proving this. It's a very common exercise in abstract algebra textbooks. If $G$ is a group with a subgroup $H$ of finite index $n$, then $G$ has a normal subgroup $K$ contained in $H$ whose index in $G$ is finite and divides $n!$. I found the proof on this Wikipedia page at some point (although the proof appears to be no longer there), but I got lost in one of the details.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The proof is really simple. Let $X$ be the set of left cosets of $H$. Consider $\\phi: G \\to \\text{Sym}(X)$ given by $\\phi(x)(aH)=(xa)H$. Then $\\phi$ is a homomorphism. Consider now $K=\\ker \\phi$. Then $K$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ contained in $H$. Finally, $G/K$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $\\text{Sym}(X)$, which has order $n!$, where $n=[G:H]$. Thus, $[G:K]$ is finite and divides $n!$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem based on the user's example. The original question is about group theory. The user wants the assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. \n\nFirst, the problem states that G is a group with a subgroup H of finite index n. So the first assumption should be that G is a group. Then, H is a subgroup of G, which is another assumption. The index of H in G is finite and equal to n. Wait, the index is finite, so maybe that's a separate assumption. But in the example, the first assumption was \"n is an integer\", then \"n is divisible by 7\". So perhaps here, the assumptions would be:\n\n- G is a group.\n- H is a subgroup of G.\n- The index of H in G is n.\n- n is a finite integer.\n\nBut the original problem says \"has a normal subgroup K contained in H whose index in G divides n!\". So the problem is to prove the existence of such a K. \n\nLooking at the example, the assumption included specific conditions on n. Here, the key conditions are that H has finite index n. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- G is a group.\n- H is a subgroup of G.\n- The index of H in G is a finite integer n.\n\nThen the problem is to show that there exists a normal subgroup K of G such that K is contained in H, and the index of K in G divides n!.\n\nWait, but the original problem statement says \"whose index in G is finite and divides n!\". So the index of K in G must be finite and divide n!. But since n is already finite, and K is a subgroup containing H, then the index of K would divide n!.\n\nSo structuring the assumptions step by step:\n\n1. G is a group. (This is a basic assumption.)\n2. H is a subgroup of G. (Given.)\n3. The index of H in G is finite, denoted as n. (Given in the problem.)\n4. Then, the problem is to find a normal subgroup K contained in H with index dividing n!.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the index being finite and equal to n would be two separate points. Wait, but n is defined as the index, which is already finite. So perhaps the key assumptions are:\n\n- G is a group.\n- H is a subgroup of G.\n- The index [G : H] is a finite integer n.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that there exists a normal subgroup K of G such that K is contained in H and [G : K] divides n!.\n\nI need to check if there are more assumptions. The problem mentions K is a normal subgroup in G, contained in H, and its index divides n!. So the assumptions needed are just those about G, H, and the index. There's no other condition given. Therefore, the formatted problem should list those three assumptions and then state the problem accordingly.",
