    "Content": "I'm self studying Steven Roman's Advanced Linear Algebra , and this is problem 10 of Chapter 8. Let $A,B\\in M_2(\\mathbb{C})$, $A^2=B^3=I$, $ABA=B^{-1}$, but $A\\neq I$ and $B\\neq I$. If $C\\in M_2(\\mathbb{C})$ commutes with $A$ and $B$, then $C=rI$ for some $r\\in\\mathbb{C}$. Is there a way to solve this without writing out arbitrary matrices and attempting to solve a huge system of equations? The only thing I observe is that $A=A^{-1}$, so $B\\sim B^{-1}$, so $B$ and $B^{-1}$ have the same characteristic polynomial. I'm stymied trying to show $C$ is diagonal, let alone a multiple of $I$. Thanks for any ideas. I should add that I know that the center $Z(M_n(\\mathbb{C}))$ consists of scalar multiples of $I$, but I don't see any reason to assume or prove $C$ commutes with everything.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Note that $B$ must have both primitive cube roots of unity as eigenvalues, as $B$ is conjugate to its inverse and has order $3$. Then note that $A$ and $B$ can have no common eigenvector, since if $Av = \\lambda v$ and $Bv = \\omega v,$ then $\\lambda^{2} = 1$, so  $ABAv = \\lambda^{2}\\omega v  = \\omega v,$ while $ABAv = \\omega^{-1}v,$ a contradiction. This means that there is no $1$-dimensional subspace which is left invariant by both $A$ and $B.$ But if $\\mu$ is an eigenvalue of $C,$ and $A$ and $B$ commute with $C,$ then the $\\mu$-eigenspace of $C$ is invariant under both $A$ and $B,$ so must be two-dimensional, and $C = \\mu I.$ This is really an instance of Schur's Lemma from representation theory.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to format the given problem into the specified structure. First, I need to parse the original question from Math Stack Exchange. The title is about a matrix C that commutes with A and B, and the conclusion is that C must be a scalar multiple of the identity. \n\nThe problem mentions several conditions: A and B are 2x2 complex matrices, A squared is the identity, B cubed is the identity, and the relation ABA = B inverse. Also, A and B are not the identity matrices themselves. The main goal is to show that any matrix C commuting with both A and B must be a scalar multiple of the identity. \n\nSo, to list the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let me break it down:\n\n1. A is in M_2(ℂ) (the space of 2x2 complex matrices).\n2. B is in M_2(ℂ).\n3. A squared equals the identity matrix (A² = I).\n4. B cubed equals the identity matrix (B³ = I).\n5. The product ABA equals B inverse (ABA = B⁻¹).\n6. A is not equal to the identity matrix (A ≠ I).\n7. B is not equal to the identity matrix (B ≠ I).\n8. C is in M_2(ℂ) and commutes with both A and B (CA = AC and CB = BC).\n\nThe problem statement would then be to prove that under these assumptions, C must be a scalar multiple of the identity matrix.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is separate and applies to one object. The conditions on A and B are each separate: their matrix spaces, their powers, the commutation relation ABA = B⁻¹, and the fact that they're not identity matrices. Then, the conditions on C: it commutes with both A and B. \n\nI should check if there's any hidden assumption. For example, the fact that A and B are 2x2 is crucial here because in higher dimensions, the conclusion might not hold. Also, working over the complex numbers is important because it ensures eigenvalues exist, which might be necessary for the proof. However, the problem as stated doesn't explicitly require mentioning the field unless it's part of the given conditions, which it is (M_2(ℂ)). \n\nSo, the assumptions are all covered. The problem is to show C is a scalar multiple of I. The example given by the user for the previous problem had assumptions split into separate lines, each with a single condition. So I need to follow that structure.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list each assumption as separate points, and the problem statement as proving that C is a scalar multiple of the identity.",
